builds a better vinyl floor
Better building starts from the floor. Modern vinyl floorings are deep in colour, easy to clean, scuff and scratch
proof. Because they're made with Geon, their pore-free surface is resistant to dirt, dust, oils and solvents.
Today, more and more manufacturers are using Geon in vinyl asbestos tiles, flexible vinyl tiles and sheetings.
In any industry, Geon's versatility helps break the stalemate to product improvement. Have you a product we
can improve or develop?

National Notebook
Tomorrow’s Emoh Ruo
\ major housing dilemma a hundred
or so years hence might not be
what sort of dwelling will people live in,
rather just where will there be room to
put it. The problem has been looked
at seriously enough by 650 Australian
architecture students who entered futur-
istic designs in a “House of the Future”
competition at Melbourne University.
In the 21st century, according to these
budding Wrights and Utzons, people in
Australia will already be looking for
somewhere besides overcrowded suburbs
to raise families in. Some suggest we
shall have to move out into the arid
centre of the country, taking our own
trees and plants with us. Others look
to the sea, suggesting we’ll be living on
it in glorified houseboats. A few believe
we’ll actually be forced to live under-
water in roomy, globular submarine-
type houses. Somewhat strangely, few
believe the trend will be toward ever-
higher blocks of flats.
A major reason for this is a widely
held view that motor traffic, as we know
it today, is on the way out. We’ll all be
whizzing through the air in helicopters,
hydrofoils and helicars. What pubhc
transport is needed will be catered for
by monorails —smooth, clean, quiet, fast
and economical.
A few interesting differences of
opinion arise among entrants on the sort
of close environment the Australian of
up to 500 years hence will want. Some,
naturally, say things will be so modern
that we’ll all be living almost exclusively
in air-conditioned serenity. But others
maintain that there will be a “natural”
Australian reaction against this sort- of
weather-cushioned enclosure. They argue
that this would be too artificial, even
an un-Australian atmosphere: “Rain must
fall, wind must blow, we must live with
nature,” one entrant insisted in his
accompanying notes.
On some things a large majority of
entrants agreed. For instance, the days
of the one block of land-one-home-on-
it are ending. Land blocks —if they are
still in sufficient supply must be
judiciously pressed into duty to hold
two, three or more separate homes.
Dovetailing designs or building partly
one on top of the other would still allow
maximum privacy with minimum area
waste under such schemes.
Some suggest that bedrooms sleep
areas they will be called, apparently
are better accommodated underground.
“You can’t admire a view when you’re
asleep, anyway,” one student noted.
(Are we to lose that lovely old custom
of breakfast in bed?) Anyway, putting
sleep areas underground is also recom-
mended as therefore providing a quieter
surrounding for them and leaving more
ground available for agriculture and
attractive parklands—for viewing from
other rooms.
How much food will we need genera-
tions hence? Several forward-looking
theorists who considered this believe we
shall buy all our food pre-cooked or in
dehydrated form so that all the woman
of the house will have to do is heat it.
As the local gas people sponsored the
show, it would seem from studying the
competition entries that electricity is to
disappear from our landscape and good
old gas is going to make an overwhelming
comeback into our lives. A few of the
more daring students referred to solar
energy being collected easily through
transparent plastic house coatings and
in a few other ways, but hardly any
went into any vast detail on this score.
Overall, the designs, although imagin-
ative enough, are not as far out as the
suggestions about where we build our
future home. We seem to be heading
for some sort of desperation point in
this line. The student who suggested we
live in undersea bubbles of plastic with
filtered air coming in seemed to hit on
too easy a solution. Only slightly less
easy, perhaps, was the one who would
put us all on round, plastic houseboats,
each moored to our own “allotment’’
of seabed. A few decided the best way
to scrimp on land and air space would
be to shift us all into monstrous honey-
comb-like flat blocks, very much like
bees now inhabit (only commensurately
bigger, of course).
One suggested our homes have tele-
scopic, push-out and pull-in rooms.
Along comes mother-in-law or time to
go to bed and, heave-ho, everyone pushes
and out pops an extra room for the
house proper, to be hefted in again
come the dawn or time for the visitor’s
hydrofoil to whisk her off again.
All told, perhaps we should even now
be thinking of such problems that lie
ahead. But seeing some of these solutions
thrown up in this exhibition, one could
be excused for wanting to postpone
thought on it a while longer.
Servant Problem
'T'he latest Catholic “in” joke:
The Pope is the servant of the
servants of God.
The bishops are the servants of the
servant of the servants of God.
The priests are the servants of the
servants of the servant of the servants
of God.
And the laity, they have a servant
problem.

The Old Mateship
AAThen Mr Dibbs Mather talked of
* " the plan to produce a quarterly
“Australarts”, a glossy compendium of
what Australians are doing in culture,
in London, we showed no surprise. And
that, of course, was the worst reaction
anyone could have shown.
Mr Mather is hoping for surprise and
indignation. “When we bring out the
first copy of ‘Australarts’ in September,
during the Commonwealth Festival, we
hope very much that the London Press
will say: ‘But why on earth is a magazine
on Australian culture being produced in
London; why not in Australia?’ ” he said.
“Then we shall be able to kick up a stink
and say, because the Australian Govern-
ment does nothing to keep its artists at
home and nothing to develop our own
culture. That is going to make the Gov-
ernment look pretty sick. And if Aus-
tralia wants to keep its favorable image,
it will have to begin to do something.”
“Australarts” may not be the stuff to
unseat governments, but its primary
objectives seem very practical. Mr
Mather pointed out that communication
between Australia and Britain was “very
bad” with the result that Australians in
London generally did not know what
was being done here or what oppor-
tunities might exist which could induce
them to put a shaky foot on a ship home.
On the other hand, Australians did not
hear much about many of their com-
patriots in London. These artists were
cut off from their public here, and also
from managements here who might be
interested in them.
Mr Mather said that many Australians
in London would much prefer to work
in their own country, if it were at all
possible. “Even Australians who are
now big international stars, if they drink
a few beers at a party, start talking about
how their country ‘rejected them’,” he
said.
Mr Mather said he himself cried all
the way out of Fremantle Harbor when
he left three years ago. “But I felt I
had no alternative,” he said. “I trained
as a schoolteacher and did some theatre
work in most States, but I could see no
end to the position of first-rate local
players like Grant Taylor getting third-
rate billing, and third-rate imports like
Bunty Turner being treated as stars.”
Mr Mather now works for BBC Sound
as interviewer and commentator but was
recently in Australia for a visit.
“But, actually, the whole idea of ‘Aus-
tralarts’ is just to prepare the ground
for the exodus to begin, when Aus-
tralians begin to return home,” Mr
Mather said.
“We’re all pretty worked up about this,
you know. We feel that psychological
war is being waged on Australia. There
are traitors in our midst, but no one
recognises them. If someone were to
send guns to invade us there would be
a pretty quick response, but the people
who are foisting an alien culture on Aus-
tralia are taking the country away from
us without a blow being struck.
“But we plan to fight. It’s the old
mateship at work. If a mob of sheep get
together and shove, there’s a bit of power
behind it, and that’s us.”
Some Soak
A rchaic as the drinking laws are,
New Zealanders still pride them-
selves on being able to “knock back a
few”. Certainly the feat of 500 Christ-
church University undergraduates drink-
ing a pub dry by “knocking back” 615
gallons of beer in 165 minutes during an
unofficial Capping Week stunt lends
support to this.
In 75 minutes of that time, the
students had soaked in 400 gallons of
the total. This achieved for them two
records —the highest consumption for a
hotel on a Tuesday afternoon and the
quickest consumption. The students,
packed like sardines in the two bars of
the hotel, paid about £4OO for the beer.
According to the licensee, there was little
rowdyism, though a great deal of noise,
and, apart from slopped beer, very little
damage.
Early Bird by 1967
McGann in New York re-
ports that Australia can expect to
be in the “Early Bird” satellite system by
the end of 1967. By then the relay
satellite at present hovering 2300 miles
above the Atlantic and linking Europe
and America in one television circuit
will have become a world-wide system. -
A spokesman for Communications
Satellite Corporation of Washington,
known as Comsat, said Australia would
be linked into the global system once she
had built a ground station.
But many problems remain to be
solved in the global operation of Early
Bird. Since it is a commercial opera-
tion, the cost factor is the first one. So
far Comsat has been providing its ser-
vices free on an experimental basis, but
the company is expected to ask a high
price—possibly 12,000 dollars an hour—
for the use of Early Bird, exclusive of
charges for land communication lines to
and from the satellite ground stations.
One network which wants to use Early
Bird every night for its newscasts esti-
mates that it might cost them nearly
2,000,000 dollars a year.

THE CONSULS
ffij^ulCetCci
80 Years Ago: June 13, 1885
are in Sydney only three de-
-*■ cently paid Consuls those of
America, France, and Germany. Yet
there are a huge number of gentle-
men who, on every official occasion,
sport gold lace and such titles as
“Consul-General” or “Vice-Consul”.
The salaries of these gentlemen con-
sist of from one to three bunches of
bananas annually paid unpunctually
in arrear.
T'he N.S.W. Inspector-General of the
A Insane reports that at the end of
1884 there were in the colony 2524
registered lunatics. (It is to be noticed
en passant that this was before the
Soudan Contingent started.) Of this
number 1552 were males and 972
females. An unusual number of “hat-
ters”, harmless “cranks”, and imbecile
children were admitted during ’B4.
The cause of this is said to be that the
hard times make it a matter of dif-
ficulty for cranks to obtain work, and
prompt parents to surrender their
helpless children to the State. (An-
other reason not noticed in the report
is that several country papers faded
away during the year, and their
editors had to go somewhere.) Religi-
ous excitement was the cause of in-
sanity with seven males and 14 fem-
ales. One attendant was kicked by a
patient, and died from consequent
peritonitis, and another sustained a
fracture of the forearm while holding
a violent lunatic. The cost of main-
taining each patient is 12s. 3d. per
week.

“Sunny New South Wales” and
other poems, could not find a secon-
der for his motion to exclude The
Bulletin from the School of Arts

PLAIN ENGLISH
A Period of Reflection
T'he bitter accusations being bandied
about in Malaysia between Malay
politicians and supporters of Singa-
pore’s Mr Lee Kuan Yew have about
them the frightening air of all self-
fulfilling prophecies: the more they
accuse each other of betraying
Malaysia, the greater the risk of the
real collapse of Ma J aysia.
Both Mr Lee’s People’s Action
Party and the Malayan political groups
claim they want to establish a united
Malaysia. But the PAP, like its
leader, seems impatient to impose non-
communalism right away. It says it
wants to cut across the racial dif-
ferences which have been and still are
very much the reality of Malaysian
life. Tunku Abdul Rahman’s Alli-
ance Party, on the other hand, claims
to have a more moderate and long-
term approach of first establishing
inter-racial harmony between the
racially-organised groups and using
tipis as a base to go on to ultimate
non-communalism.
But the Alliance interprets Mr Lee’s
sense of urgency and principle of im-
mediate non-communalism as veiled
excuses for pushing ahead with
Chinese control of Malaysia, since the
Chinese, with their better education,
better business and administrative ex-
perience, would have the advantage
if the Malays were not protected by
communal privileges. Mr Lee’s sup-
porters, however, see the moderate
and compromising approach of the
Malay leadership, which is partly an
attempt to give Malays a chance to
bridge the education gap, as justifying
their accusations that Chinese are dis-
criminated against politically. In this
atmosphere the attacks grow more
heated. Mr Lee, a brilliant and dedi-
cated politician, is accused of being a
“traitor” and helping the Indonesians.
He, in turn, accuses the Malay leaders
of working to destroy democracy.
In the midst of such bitterness,
which is of particular concern to Aus-
tralia, the one encouraging note is the
reasoned approach of some sections
of the Malaysian Press. They clearly
accept that communal and racial dif-
ferences are very much part of the
national life and that no simple solu-
tion, based on wishful thinking, is
going to help. Instead a start must
be made to break the vicious circle of
suspicion. The “Straits Times”, for
example, in criticising the PAP,
strongly urged a reflection”.
It said that Mr Lee had been “reck-
less and dangerous” in accusing the
Government of working deliberately
towards Malay domination and the de-
struction of democratic rights, but it
also added: “Meanwhile it is just as
important that critics of Mr Lee on
the Right wing of the Government
parties now hold their peace”.
Australians can add nothing to that.
It would be a tragedy if the most suc-
cessful democracy in South-East Asia
and one of our closest allies tore itself
to pieces.
Sir William Breaks Silence
CiR William Gunn’s public entry
into Federal politics last week was
as disastrous as has been his advocacy
of a reserve price scheme for wool—a
scheme which, if adopted, would not
only fail in its purpose but would cer-
tainly increase Government control of
the wool industry. Politically, Sir Wil-
liam Gunn is most noted for a policy
towards Red China which is almost
indistinguishable from that of the Left
wing of the Labor Party, and in Mel-
bourne last week he underlined this
when he repeated his defence of in-
creased trade with Red China that
he has yet to hear of a people with Tull
bellies who have turned to Commun-
ism.
The importance of this silly remark
is probably not so much his apparent
ignorance of the facts that Communism
is frequently strong in prosperous parts
of the world, such as in Northern Italy,
and that its power has nothing to do
with empty bellies in normally well-
fed countries like Vietnam or Indo-
nesia; it is rather that it is at least a
public statement of Wool Board think-
ing. While Sir William has been chair-
man of the Board over the past year,
its dealings with Red China have re-
ceived almost no publicity at all
about the only non-publicised activity
of this publicity-conscious Board. As
the story on page 81 points out, the
Red Chinese technicians have come
and gone without one picture in the
papers or one interview arranged, des-
pite the Wool Board’s well-known ex-
pertise in arranging Press conferences
and despite the tremendous importance
to Australia of the whole issue and the
gravity of the dangers involved. (Sir
William is also chairman of the Inter-
national Wool Secretariat which has
an Asian division and which usually
issues hand-outs by the million but has
not issued a single hand-out on its
Red China activities.)
Whoever replaces Sir William as
chairman of the Wool Board should
at least come into the open about the
China trade so that the dangers and
issues are widely and publicly discus-
sed and the farmers and graziers have
a clear understanding of the traps in-
volved in making themselves and
Australia dependent on the power
which intends to dominate South-East
Asia and Australia, both militarily
and politically.
It is obvious that Sir William in
politics will not change his views;
he has advocated increasing all sorts
of trade with China and will be a
spokesman for this in Cabinet, if he
is elected and appointed, as seems
certain.
This prospect adds reality to the re-
current nightmare of a possible alli-
ance between the Left wing of the
Labor Party and the nai'ver Country
Party politicians around the question
of trade with China—a development
which would be in the worst possible
interests in Australia and could help
bring the China lobby to power.
Juries
NSW Bar Association’s defence
A of the jury system in accident
cases has inevitably been greeted with
cynicism (“They are trying to protect
their racket”), but its basic argument
is nonetheless persuasive. Juries are
better representatives of community
attitudes and reflect changes in them
far more readily than precedent-bound
judges. It is surely clear that most
people who have lost, say, an arm or
an eye would rather have their cases
decided by a panel of ordinary people
than by a judge; certainly there is no
evidence that the public, is clamoring
for any reform in this field. If, in
fact, the jury system involves a cer-
tain “waste of time” and sometimes
leads to “excessive” awards, this is a
price worth paying, and other less
drastic reforms could be introduced to
meet these complaints.


THIS AUSTRALIA
PREMIERS’ CONFERENCE
Riding the Tiger
The new boy’s performance
Mr. ASKIN, Federal Treasurer Mr. HOLT and the Prime Minister Sir ROBERT MENZIES at
the Loan Council meeting.
Sitting pat on the defence needs and
holding the bank, the Commonwealth
Ministers winked an eye at Mr Askin’s
trumping of Mr Bolte’s ace at the finance
talks in Canberra last week. The State
Premiers did not even pretend they had
the tricks to take the rubber. Both in
tax reimbursements and loan allocations
they had to toe the Commonwealth line.
After the expansive mood of the pre-
liminary Premiers’ Conference in April
to discuss a replacement for the six-year
grants agreement ending this month, last
week's meetings were an anti-climax.
They were bound to be; in the interim
By J. C. HORSFALL
Treasury officials from Canberra and the
States had thrown Mr Renshaw’s ideas
of incorporating a generous growth ele-
ment into the new agreement out the
window. Like Mr Renshaw himself, the
conception of a three per cent.- better-
ment factor - did not figure in the final
play.
The Premiers were alarmed that the
new proposals put up for tax reimburse-
ments in the next five years produced
the unpalatable result that they would
get less next year under the new for-
mula than they would have received
under the old one. But, because in the
succeeding four years of the new for-
mula they would get progressively more
each year than under the old one (in
fact by 1969-70 £lB million more), they
were not inclined to look such a gift
horse in the mouth.
Their problem was to get a different
result for next year and still secure the
more favorable shape of things for those
next four years. In the result the usual
horse-trading got under way fairly
smartly, with the Commonwealth as
much as the Premiers up to all the
tricks of the time-honored diplomacy
of these gatherings. In two stages the
Premiers managed to get the tax reim-
bursement grants for next year up to
£376.4 million, which is £5.6 million
more than they would have got under
the proposed revised formula, and £3.2
million more than under the old for-
mula.
UNSATISFIED: The only Premier
unsatisfied with this achievement was
Mr Bolte, who was bought off with
a pourboire of £600,000. On his
version this was just and proper
because Victoria had been badly treated
under the old formula, and anyway
his State had special problems —-
not wanting poker machines and such
like. More truthfully, Mr Bolte dared
not go home without a tactical victory
in money terms to show an electorate
rapidly losing faith in his nuisance value
in Canberra, and certainly one which
would have bucked had he increased his
local tax slugs in the forthcoming State
Budget. Behind the Speaker’s chair he
was, in fact, conspiring for political
survival.
All in all, although the revised agree-
ment for State reimbursements makes no
change in the basic method of calcu-
lating the grants or changes the weight
given to population increases in the
various States, it makes some very use-
ful concessions to the incidence of wage
increases on the grants. It does this by
increasing the betterment factor in the
calculation from. 1.1 to 1.2 per cent:
instead of 1.1 per cent of the full average
increase in wages in Australia in the
year preceding being written into the
grant, as under the formula agreed in
1959, the adjustment in the next five
years will be 1.2 per cent of the average
increase in wages.
All this was enough to send at least
Mr Bolte home in high spirits with the
assurance that his own State taxes would
not have to be increased this year (this
of course is quite apart from his recent
increase in motor taxation to provide
£3} million a year extra for roads). But
what speeded Mr Askin on his way back
to Sydney was that at the Loan Council
meeting next day he succeeded in getting
a £1.5 million bonus on his State’s loan
allocation without going behind the
scenes to do a deal. If Mr Bolte could
pull something in a private talk with Sir
Robert, this only made Askin’s open
tactics the more effective.
Mr. Askin's success was the only flash
of interest at the Loan Council meetings
which ended rather abruptly. There was
ho question, the Commonwealth said, of
giving the Premiers the additional £lB
million they asked for works and housing
this year. The most it could do with de-
mands on resources, especially for de-
fence, so pressing, was to offer £295
million only £5 million more than
actually allotted in 1964-65.

Stocking the Cabinet
Mr McEwen’s concern
The three junior Defence Ministers—
Navy, Army and Air—might well have
relaxed last week when the Prime Minis-
ter, Sir Robert Menzies, announced in
Canberra that a Country Party Minister
would definitely be appointed to the
Cabinet vacancy, unfilled for months.
It meant that they would not be affected
by a general reshuffle.
When the former Minister for Social
Services, Mr Hugh Roberton, was ap-
pointed as the first Australian Ambassa-
dor to Ireland early in the year, Sir
Robert and the leader of the Country
Party, Mr J. McEwen, decided not to fill
the vacancy until about the'middle of the
year. Both wanted to watch the perform-
ance of the three Service Ministers
Mr F. Chaney (Navy), Dr A. Forbes
(Army) and Mr P. Howson (Air)- —none
of whom exactly handled his portfolio
with confidence last year. Even if a
By BRIAN JOHNS
complete reshuffle was unnecessary, Sir
Robert and Mr McEwen felt that the
“obvious” contender for the vacancy, the
Minister for Territories, Mr C. Barnes,
needed time to prove himself.
The recent months have apparently
convinced the two leaders that a drastic
reshuffle of the full Ministry is not called
for, but the position of Mr Barnes has
not been strengthened. If Mr Barnes is
bypassed, as he deserves to be, the choice
lies between the youthful Minister for the
Interior, Mr D. Anthony, and the new-
comers to the Ministry, the Minister for
Repatriation, Senator Gerald McKellar,
and the Minister for Social Services, Mr
lan Sinclair. Mr McEwen prefers to keep
to seniority in promoting Country Party
members. If Mr Barnes is by-passed, this
J. D. ANTHONY
would give the advantage to Mr Anthony,
whose Cabinet appointment would be
given added weight by the electoral re-
distribution which comes within his
ministerial ambit. In the long-term, Mr
Anthony and the third Cabinet candidate,
the Minister for Repatriation, Mr lan Sin-
clair. have higher stakes the leadership
of the Country Party. The unusual com-
bination of barrister and grazier, Mr Sin-
clair is regarded as the most able of the
younger Country Party members and Mr
McEwen has been extremely pleased with
his performance as a junior Minister.
The Cabinet portfolio which Mr
McEwen is most anxious to bring within
the Country Party fold is National
Development. It is reported that late
last year, when Mr McEwen first had
discussions with the Prime Minister
about Cabinet membership, the Country
Party leader was prepared to forgo the
promotion of one of his own Ministers
to allow the Liberal, Senator John Gor-
ton, a place. For this concession he had
in mind the eventual handling of National
Development by a Country Party man.
Mr McEwen’s interest in the National
Development portfolio goes further back.
When the Queensland Liberal, Mr A.
Hulme, re-entered Parliament, Mr Mc-
Ewen agreed that he should have the
traditional Country Party portfolio of
Postmaster-General —again with his eye
on National Development.
The Country Party leader is far from
happy about the way this department
has been handling its responsibilities. Mr
McEwen blamed National Development
for the embarrassing delay in resolving
the Federal election promise for the
equalisation of petrol prices, and, at a
crucial stage, stepped in himself to get
action.
Mr McEwen is now reported to be
[?]. M. SINCLAIR
very disturbed at what he regards as
failure of National Development to pro-
tect Australia's interests in the sale of
iron ore to Japan. He believes that Aus-
tralia is vulnerable to criticism for dis-
locating the international market —in
particular from India, Malaysia and
Brazil—by selling West Australian ore to
the Japanese at an average price of 15
per cent below current market rates. But
more importantly, he believes that WA
ore deals place the BHP at an unfair dis-
advantage to compete on the overseas
steel market. In the face of this dis-
advantage. any exhortation to the BHP
from the Federal Government to increase
its export efforts would sound pretty
hollow.
It is understood that, short of bringing
National Development into the Country
Party's jurisdiction, Mr McEwen is con-
vinced that the department needs a strong
injection of business expertise into its
policy-making on minerals the major
and very nearly the only function left to
the department, sacked over recent years
by existing or newly-formed ministries.
WOOL
Beating the
Gunn
Out of town
Sir William Gunn, for a new boy poli-
tician, already knows a number of tricks.
As chairman of the Wool Board, when-
ever he wants to drop a bombshell, first
he leaves for overseas, then waits for the
statement to be made when he is in
Hawaii, London, Tokyo or wherever.
This is easy to do because he averages
five trips a year.
His latest little bombshell was no
exception. The news that he would seek
Country Party endorsement for the
Queensland electorate of Maranoa came
on May 14. Where was Sir William?
He was in Brussels, attending a meeting
of the International Wool Secretariat,
and far from tiresome questions. Last
week Sir William returned from his
world tour, the Wool Board hired the
“Drawing Room” at Menzies and at last
Sir William agreed to meet his inquisi-
tors. Like Lord De L'lsle he had his
tape-recorder there taking down every
word for his own private double-check.
Most of the Pressmen were there for
one prime reason and the first question
was inevitable: “Sir William, why have
you decided to stand for Maranoa?”
“Do you mind,” said he, “If we leave
my political career until I have finished
with the wool industry. After all, this
conference has been organised by the
Wool Board. The afternoon newspaper-
men, who were hoping to hit the home
editions, went pale. But Sir William was
saving his power. He talked and talked


wool. Over an hour went by. Someone
tried again. “Sir, as a potential politician,
what would you say to . . .” “I would
say,” said Sir William, “That at the
moment I am having a glass of water.”
At one hour 15 minutes after the con-
ference started, he finally relented. “All
right. All right. I suppose I can’t keep
you out any longer. Confident. Yes, if
I can’t win Maranoa I ought to hang
my head in shame. It’s only been lost
to the Country Party once before. Would
I like to be leader of the Country Party?
The answer is obviously, ‘Yes’. Anyone
would be false if they denied that. Prime
Minister? Well, who would decline the
most important position in the country?
It's not my ambition now. I would like
to be PM. But not if it involved leaving
the Country Party.”
“Now wait a minute, you're getting
me over a barrel. Let me say something.”
Sir William, the 17-stone heavyweight
took a temporary breather in a neutral
corner. “This probably is the most diffi-
cult decision I have ever had to make.
SIR WILLIAM GUNN
If I had wanted to go into politics I
would not have waited this long. Fifteen
years ago I. was under pressure to go
in ... I have a lot of friends in the wool
industry and a lot of enemies, but more
friends than enemies. I have been per-
suaded that I can serve the nation bet-
ter in this field. Reluctantly, that’s what
I’m going to do.”
The conference went on and on and
Sir William became in a very happy
mood for talking. He was even prep-
ared to talk of future Gunn ideas as a
politician. He told Pressmen that there
were more ways of fighting Commun-
ism than with guns (doubtful if fun
intended). Communism never thrived
where there were full bellies, he said,
and he explained a quite remarkable
wheat market scheme.
It was a dreadful thing that there
should be any restrictions on the produc-
tion of foodstuffs. It was his idea that
there should be an international body
which would purchase the world’s
wheat. This would be sold to all coun-
tries according to their ability to pay,
a means test if you like. Wealthy coun-
tries would pay a stiff price, right down
the scale to impoverished famine coun-
tries, who would, perhaps, pay nothing.
How will that go down with the wheat
grower, Sir William?
It will give him security,” he said.
“What security has the wheat grower got
today? None. Tell me, what would hap-
pen if the United States recognised Com-
munist China tomorrow?”
It was a good conference, and there
were a number of quotes worth taking.
On wool prices: “We have seen the
worst. We are at the bottom of the
trough. In the next six months we should
see an improvement.” On wool promo-
tion: “There’s the famous statement by
the chairman of Unilever: ‘Fifty per cent
of our budget was wasted but I can't
tell you which 50 per cent’.”
On reserve price plebiscite: “I think
we have had a better than 50-50 chance
at the moment with the wool growers,
The board will go out on the hustings,
There will be just as many meetings on
markets as promotions.” On wool’s
future: “I am not pessimistic about the
future. In fact I am more optimistic than
I have ever been after meeting 3000
people engaged in the textile industry
overseas. Opinion of reserve price over-
seas: “They would welcome anything that
would give them more stability in prices.”
The conference finished at 3.10, more
than two hours after it started. At the
finish Pressmen noticed Sir William was
sitting cross-legged and that he had a
hole through the sole of his shoe. When
one is a near-millionaire it is difficult
to attend to these matters.
PUBLIC SERVICE
Paying the Servants
Board adopts a realistic attitude
The hour-long discussion between
union officials representing Public Ser-
vice employees and the Prime Minister,
Sir Robert Menzies, in Canberra a fort-
night ago, over the delay in conciliation
processes has obviously had more than
just some effect.
Next Wednesday five officials of the
Administrative and Clerical Officers’
Association, headed by the Federal presi-
dent, Mr N. J. Campbell, will begin
negotiations with the Public Service
Board in Canberra to fix appropriate
salary rates. Also in with the association
on this group of claims will be the Fede-
rated Clerks’ Union which has only a few
hundred members in the Taxation De-
partment. As well as these claims, the first
of which was lodged in February, 1963,
a general salaries claim has been made
as a direct approach for an increase for
only the association’s members (lodged
on May 13), and this will also be
negotiated with the Board.
FORERUNNERS: Certainly, the
activity within the Board’s offices has
pleased the Federal secretary, Mr Stan
Imer. “And it was not before time,” he
said in Sydney last week. Mr Imer con-
sidered the engineers’ case in 1961 was
the first real look at the values for work
done for the Commonwealth in more
than 25 years. Marginal increases had
been granted—in 1947, 1955 and 1960
—but none of the general rises since the
war had taken any real account of work-
value. “It was the engineers’ case that
came as the forerunner of a complete
new look at the Service,” Mr Imer said.
Observers feel that the engineers, in
breaking the ice, had lifted themselves
above all other professions within the
Service at that time—for example the
architects, scientists and surveyors. Since
then, however, a series of work-value
decisions have been given by the Public
Service Arbitrator and the other profes-
sional groups and specialist groups have
some sor t °f work-value assessment.
Complaints of the delays have been
basically in two directions. The Public
Service Arbitrator, Mr E. A. Chambers,
has.been flooded with all kinds of sundry
claims from unions operating within the
Service (29 unions have public servants
so,e] y as members, and there are 40-
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
odd outside unions with public servant
membership). This inundation has made
the Arbitrator's job practically im-
possible and he is currently hearing cases
lodged in 1961 and 1962.
Despite Mr Chambers’ wide industrial
knowledge, and the fact that he has
endeavored to shorten the hearings,
there is still this delay of up to four
years.
This, said Mr Imer, had caused in-
dustrial unrest, and the growing unrest
affected not only workers such as postal
officers, but also high-ranking profes-
sional people. It was an alarming situa-
tion when responsible public servants talk
of stop-work meetings, he said. (In May,
500 officers from the Central and Vic-
torian offices of the Taxation Depart-
ment met in Melbourne to protest at

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Gups
- throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

the excessive delays. The meeting
resolved that “unless substantial pro-
gress is made, the organisations should
give deep consideration to suggesting
ways and means by which taxation
officers can take more vigorous action”.)
Since the engineers’ case the Board
has attempted to adopt a more realistic
view of its statutory responsibilities as
a wage-fixing authority in its own right.
According to Mr Imer, for years the
Board had refused all claims and resisted
everything in the traditional employer’s
role. He felt the change of policy and
acceptance of a responsible attitude was
attributable to its present chairman, Mr
F. H. Wheeler, who took over the reins
about the time the engineers’ decision
was announced.
The big difference is that the Board
r.ow does not oppose all salary claims
for the Arbitrator expects the Board to
consider claims realistically, to negotiate
with the claimant unions and to, in effect,
fix salaries and wages. This policy has
been partly successful and many out-
standing claims had been negotiated
between unions and the Board in the past
three years.
Just how realistic the Board will be
over the association’s claims and just
how realistic the claims are, remain to
be seen: but as Mr Imer savs. “at least
the ball is rolling”.
JEWS
Waiting for
the Axe
Discrimination in Russia
Mr Isi Leibler’s recent expose, “Soviet
Jewry and Human Rights”, was worry
enough for the Communist Party of Aus-
tralia, but the real rub for the CPA lay
in the connection between two of its
Central Committee members, Mr B. Taft
and Mr R. Mortimer, and the author.
Both had carried on a number of con-
versations with Mr Leibler in Melbourne
in connection with the book, and both
were reported to have agreed that there
was, and still is, discrimination a'gainst
Jews in the Soviet. But Mr Taft saw
where events were leading, and backed
out. It is reported that he complained
to the party’s Political Committee about
Mr Mortimer’s association with Mr
Leibler.
Nevertheless, a letter from Mortimer
to Leibler appeared in the editorial
preface to the book, in which Mortimer
said: “I consider that material of the
kind contained in your study should be
widely read and probed, particularly by
friends of the Soviet Union.” Inevitably,
this came to the attention of Soviet
leaders. It was obvious to the secretariat

that it should expel Mortimer as a
gesture to the Soviet Union, but that it
would then risk causing a further split
in an already debilitated party. So
Mortimer was severely castigated within
the confines of the party’s top com-
mittees.
A commission was created, directly
supervised by the political committee,
to study and refute Leibler’s claims in
a pamphlet. The pamphlet is just as
damaging as Leibler’s book. All it can
do is to restate the Communists’
(theoretical) attitude to Jewry. In
endeavoring to refute Leibler it often
agrees with him.
But the interesting point about the
commission of enquiry is its composi-
tion. The members were Mr Eric
Aarons, the CPA’s top theoretician and
brother to Laurie; Mr Alec Robertson,
editor of “Tribune” and an Aarons man
to his toenails; Mr Paul Mortier,
recently retired from active party work
because of ill-health, but in reality be-
cause his loyalty was doubted, and Rex
Mortimer, himself.
So Mortimer found himself in- the
same position in which he had often
placed others —odd man out. He then
sided with the majority, and decided he
had been mistaken. Now, it is he who
walks with the constant thought, “When
will the axe fall?”
MEDICINE
Prescribing for Doctors
Committee’s report
The medical profession generally, and
in particular the Australian Medical
Association, has often been criticised as
being conservative and with its own
special interest. Certainly, while a strong
streak of this conservatism remains, it is
encouraging that the AMA should begin
to review the whole field of medicine in
Australia.
This move was quite noticeable at the
Fourth Federal Assembly of the Associa-
tion in Sydney recently. The decision to
raise general practitioners’ fees was
played up by the daily Press and, of
the agenda, probably attracted most
interest. But the tabling of the Medical
Services Review Committee’s report
which aims to “outline the principles of
a policy on a national health scheme”
was equally important.
The Medical Services Review Com-
mittee first met in November, 1962, and
since then has closely scrutinised the
National Health Service, from the
Benefits Scheme to the consideration of
medical education and research. The
medical practitioners themselves con-
sidered the report as a plea for the con-
tinuation of the present system of Gov-
ernment subsidised voluntary health
insurance. The report supported the
present system of private practice and
detailed the disadvantages of salaried
and of capitation services.
REVIEW: There were suggestions to
improve the operation of the National
Health Service, which included: provision
for periodic review of Commonwealth
and Fund Benefits at regular intervals,
the introduction of benefits for essential
ancillary services and endorsement of
the principle of free stabilisation with a
recommendation that adequate notice be
given to the Commonwealth Govern-
ment and fund organisations in the
event of increased medical fees.
There was concern at the standard of
medical education, and it was suggested
that perhaps two years of post-graduate
hospital training was necessary to provide
the skills required for general practice.
The report called for greater efforts to
provide general practitioners with con-
tact with “hospital” medicine, which was
necessary to keep general practitioners
informed of the latest developments and
to enable a more extensive exchange of
experience with their specialist col-
leagues.
The doctors thought that this could
best be carried out within the frame-
work of a National Hospital plan. Hos-
pitals throughout the Commonwealth
should be classified, according to staa-
dards as yet undefined, and should be
subject to review by committees of
accreditation.
(Last week the NSW Hospital As-1
sociation announced it wanted graduates
to serve a two-year compulsory hospital
term before being allowed into private
practice, and it will ask the Minister for
Health, Mr Jago, to legislate on this.
Speaking for more than 170 public hos-
pitals throughout the State, the Associa-
tion’s executive felt the two-year term
would overcome the shortage of ex-
perienced doctors in many country hos-
pitals.)
No definite policy decision was made I
on the question of the “honorary
system”, but many at the assembly felt &
it is no longer necessary for specialists
to provide their services free of charge.!
It seems likely that there will be moves
to recompense specialists for their ser-,
vices in public hospitals.
. The future development of the
National Health Service should make
provision for nursing services in the
home for physiotherapy, social work,
occupational therapy and dietetics. The
lack of benefits for these services was
felt to lead to unnecessary hospitalisation.
SHOPPING
“Quislings”
Bridging the Derwent
When the shopkeepers of Hobart
agreed in 1937 to the closing of their
premises on Saturdays they did not fore-
see the bridging of the Derwent and the.
growth of a large Eastern Shore popu-
lation centre.
In the last 15 years they have become |
increasingly agitated by the development ;
of Eastern Shore shopping centres fos-
tered by Saturday trading. Instead of
seeking repeal of the legislation which
handicaps them, the ‘"Golden
business houses have become tied in a
reactionary partnership with the Gov-
ernment and the Shop Assistants’ Union
seeking to impose a ban on Saturday
shopping throughout the State.
The North-West Coast towns aban-
doned Saturday shopping in favor of
Friday nights, but the Eastern Shore
and Launceston defiantly and profitably
kept shops open on Saturday mornings.
Every year or two the Government has
renewed the attempt to make the ban
uniform on at least one occasion

action in Victoria, and the union no
doubt believed that a shopping close-
down in Tasmania might help the case
for a Victorian close-down.
On every occasion the Legislative
Council has thrown out the legislation.
The 19 members of the Upper House
represent separate electorates, unlike the
MHAs, who are returned by proportional
representation, seven to each division.
They are jealous of local wishes and all
but the five Labor members are Indepen-
dents. The return bout this year was
notable for the defection of more than
half of the Liberal Party. After a big
split at the party meeting, the Leader,
Mr Bethune, and nine of his followers
supported the Government’s bill. His
deputy, Mr E. W. Beattie, and former
deputy, Mr Kevin Lyons, were among
the five who vehemently opposed it. The
Liberal “betrayal” brought a hot reaction
from Launceston, which considers itself
the champion of freedom against restric-
tion and is especially vocal on this
subject because it senses that the capital
is imposing its will on the paranoiacally
independent northern city.
MORIBUND: Mr Bruce Kekwick,
former Liberal MHR and State vice-
president of the party, wrote to “The
Examiner” charging the “moribund”
party leadership with “bungling”. He
would, he said, withdraw all support
from the “Quislings” of the party,
adhering only to the Federal Liberal
Party. Other important Liberals said
they w'ere withdrawing their substantial
financial support.
' Having rocketed the bill through the
Assembly, the Government faced the real
fight in the Legislative Council. There
after a long and bitter debate, Saturday
closing on the Eastern Shore succeeded
by one vote, but by 11-8 the House al-
lowed Saturday shopping to continue in
Launceston.
In the closing hours of the session, the
Government refused to accept the Legis-
lative Council amendment, but finally
surrendered at 3 a.m. in face of the
Council's refusal to budge. “But”, said
the Minister for Education, Mr Neilson,
who handled the bill, “we will put this
up until we succeed.”

Government employees, creating a new
basis for State wage level determinations.
The Premier, Frank Walsh, in admitting
Opposition charges of anomalies in the
provisions for the service payments, said
in Adelaide workers not covered could
apply to their respective wage tribunals.
The Government’s decision to grant the
service payments could undo the careful
machinations of the former Premier, Sir
Thomas Playford, to keep SA a low-
wage State. A rise in wage levels will
make it difficult for SA companies .o
compete in the eastern States and wdl
remove the low-cost attraction of the
State to new industry.
Meanwhile, after an initial show of
strength in the LCP-dominated Upper
House, where it forced ballots to select
members of committees, the Opposition
has settled down to a solid campaign of
embarrassing the new Labor Govern-
ment. In the debate on the Supple-
mentary Estimates and in question time,
the Opposition has put the Government
on the defensive and underlined its
weaknesses.
NAPPING: Loaded questions have
caught Ministers napping on several oc-
casions and the continual direction of
questions by the Opposition has taken
a heavy toll of the nervous Premier.
Unable to follow some of his rambling
and disjointed replies, Opposition mem-
bers have embarrassed the Government
by repeating questions in an attempt to
get a satisfactory answer. Walsh, in-
clined to become antagonistic under
pressure, at times appears to be losing
control of the House.
TRANSPORT
Gold Plate
"Unfair Allegations ”
Word last week that the cost of the
standard-gauge rail project had risen
from £41.2 million to £55 million has
thrown added stress on relations between
the Commonwealth and West Australian
Governments.
One Federal Minister has accused the
State of upgrading the West's internal
rail system at Commonwealth expense,
and seeking “gold plated marshalling
yards”, a claim that earned a sharp
counter-attack from the Minister for
Railways, Mr Charles Court, who said
in Perth it was “typical of the attitude
of some Commonwealth people as far as
WA is concerned”.
Canberra’s disapproval of the escala-
tion had been made clear in a letter
from the Prime Minister to the Premier,
Mr David Brand. But the answering-back
was left to Mr Court, who saidwith ob-
vious impatience: “If only the Common-
wealth would confer on these compli-
cated and important questions, instead


of making unfair allegations, we would
get a lot further.”
Mr Court also gave assurance that
there was no basis to the claim of fellow
West Australian Liberal, the Minister for
Transport, Mr Gordon Freeth, that the
standard-gauge line had lost some of its
economic attractions by BHP's decision
to cut down on the amount of ore to be
freighted over it. This touched a tender
spot, because the State Government has
been accused of undue pandering to
BHP backing BHP claims to export
ore despite Federal opposition to the
scheme.
CATHOLICS
Primary Poser
An adult rate?
The Federation of Catholic Parent-
Teacher Associations in New Zealand
has become increasingly worried by the
position of the Catholic education system
which, it says, is nearing a crisis.
Already the Federation has suggested
the organisation of a central financial
authority to help ease the position. This
proposed authority would be fed by
funds from an education rate for each
adult Catholic amounting to between
£NZS and £NZ6. The Catholic system
is suffering from the same problems as
in the State system—population increase,
rising building costs, a shortage of
teachers and higher costs for teaching—
and these have created a simmering
situation of criticism, frustration and a
need for action.
COSTS: Critics have said Catholics
cannot afford a complete system of
schooling. By 1972 it is estimated that
it will cost more than £NZIt million
a year to run the schools. Some Govern-
ment finance is available to private
schools in New Zealand by way of text-
books and subsidies on equipment, and
the fact that income tax exemptions can
also be claimed on donations and school
fees is not much help; alongside the total
cost this is just a “drop in the bucket”.
Obviously, the Federation has taken
to heart the information that a better
system can be afforded because the
average financial contribution from the
laity is relatively lower than at any stage
of NZ Catholic history—hence the adult
education rate proposal.
An approach has already been made
to Keith Holyoake’s National Govern-
ment for the payment of lay teachers in
private schools but so far no decision
has been reached. Control of Catholic
education is virtually in the hands of
the bishops, and what happens to the
suggestions recently made depends
largely on their attitudes.
KEN COATES
Missiles in Hanoi
By ANTHONY CAVE BROWN
TTNITED STATES’ aerial reconnais-
sance in the vicinity of the North
Vietnamese capital has detected Rus-
sian intrusion into the second Indo-
China war—that sort of intrusion which
with regularity brings the US and the
USSR eyeball to eyeball. An un-
specified number of “Badgers” Ilyuishin
28 medium attack bombers Russia’s
equivalent of the Canberra, which the
US is using in South Vietnam have
been identified on North Vietnamese
airfields for the first time.
Whether they have Russian crews or
not is not material (North Vietnamese
pilots and ground crews are quite com-
petent to both fly and service this air-
craft type): Russia has finally given
point to its threat to help the North
Vietnamese. More ominous is the con-
tents of a second intelligence report.
The USSR is installing SAM II anti-
aircraft missiles around Hanoi. These
are the highly-effective rockets w'hich
brought down the U 2 and several
reconnaissance aircraft over Cuba, and
their use against American aircraft over
Hanoi would cause world crisis.
As the advance party of the First
Battalion Royal Australian Regiment
digs in on the perimeter of Bien Hoa
Airbase, 12 miles from Saigon (in a
role known as aggressive defence),
there are ample signs of an imminent
large-scale Vietcong offensive through-
out the country. With the coming of
the rains they struck and chew r ed up
two expert South Vietnamese battalions,
killing or w r ounding 550 rangers in
the most vicious attack of the war.
It was not the size of the engage-
ment which w r as impressive but its
ferocity and the Australian troops
must expect to be high on the list of
Vietcong targets. A successful Vietcong
attack against the Australians would
be an important propaganda victory,
might have the effect of making other
Governments cautious in sending in
combat troops to support the American-
South Vietnamese forces.
The second Indo-China w r ar has been
described by an American general
fighting it as “a w r ar we can’t win and
daren’t lose”. China has now cleared
the decks for her involvement she
stated last week that the 17th Parallel
frontier dividing the nation no longer
exists because of American air actisns
to the north and the next three
months may well determine whether
Chinese forces will become involved
directly in the conflict. Such involve-
ment is welcome in some military
circles at the Pentagon where the argu-
nient is that Chinese imperialism will
grow bolder in direct ratio to her
evolution as a nuclear-military power.
The argument continues that China can
be emasculated militarily now at much
lower cost than in ten years’ time il
she is precipitated into the second Indo-
Cliina war, a precipitation which would
give the Americans the excuse they
need to destroy China’s nuclear bomb-
building capacity.
Obviously China’s vulnerability to air
attack is known to the Peking com-
mand, and China is unlikely to go so
far as to endanger that nuclear
capacity which, while embryonic now,
will make her a fearsome power in the
next decade. Indeed, why should China
engage in the war? With North Viet-
namese assistance (regulars were clearly
identified in the Ba Gia offensive which
marked the opening of the monsoon
offensive) on the ground and Russian
and Chinese overt and covert help
in every area except direct military
participation, the Vietcong feel assured
of victory without Chinese troops.
How far LBJ is prepared to go is
the key to these critical months ahead
in Indo-China. And the quintessence
of this imponderable is just how many
troops he is prepared to commit in
defence of South Vietnam. One indica-
tion of the refusal of the Americans to
throw in the towel now or at any time
is the US decision to assist the South
Vietnamese Government in the recruit-
ment, training and equipment of an-
other 160,000 “ARVIN” (South Viet-
namese Army)—an impressively large
task which would not be undertaken
if the White House thought for a
moment of abandoning the conflict.
The second indication of the pursuit
of the hard line is the continuing move-
ment of US ground and air forces into
the ellipse of bases in the Pacific.
A Vietcong victory is confidently ex-
pected as the cards are at the moment.
This confidence can only be upset if
the US decides to commit massive
forces to South Vietnam, to wage all-
out air war against the North, and to
intensify its naval blockade of the Indo-
China coast to throttle the Vietcong
supply lines. The first two of these
measures would undoubtedly bring Asia
closer to general war, involving China.
Is such a war acceptable to Washing-
ton? Whatever the outcome, the Dig-
gers in the foxholes around Bien Hoa
are facing w'hat may well prove to be
the most formidable enemy they have
had to face anywhere at any time.


This could be the most
rewarding business quiz
you ever answer-.
Does it cost more to export by air?
This naturally depends on your product. Recently, for
example, an Australian manufacturer of heavy machinery
compared the costs of air and surface transport and found
that both costs worked out about the same. In addition,
air cargo offered his Far East clients same day service—
at no extra cost. Packaging charges were nil, insurance
rates lower, no damage in transit.
Remember, your products could be a case for air cargo.
Does air freight cut down on warehousing?
Yes. Through regular air freight servicing, both in
Australia and overseas, warehousing can be dramatically
reduced and in many cases eliminated. With fast daily
Qantas services, there is no need to stockpile. Think of
the savings gained on inventory, interest and capital
requirements.
Do Australian exporters compete more successfully on
overseas markets by air?
Yes, in many cases, it is only through air freighting that
Australian manufacturers of dozens of commodities can
compete so successfully in world markets. For example,
many garment manufacturers in men’s and women’s
apparel are enjoying spectacular successes on the Ameri-
can market because of Qantas’ daily deliveries to
the U.S.A.
Does packaging with air freight cost more or less?
Definitely less. And the savings you realise are usually
substantial. Sometimes, total! Your product may not
require packaging at all. When it is needed, air packaging
is light, functional and protective. (One Australian manu-
facturer saves £lO on each unit of equipment.) Don't
think of packaging as a problem. Think Air Cargo.
Do you get equal insurance rates by air?
If your answer was “No,” you were right. You actually
get much lower insurance rates with air cargo! You can
save up to 70% of your insurance premiums when you
consign by air.
Why? Because your consignments are under maximum
security conditions on the ground and in the air, from
departure to destination, safeguarding against pilferage,
damage and loss. Your goods arrive in perfect condition.
How many tons of cargo can be carried on a Qantas Y-Jet?
A Qantas V-Jet, with a full complement, can carry as much
cargo as a DC-4 freighter. Up to 7 tons. The Boeing
338 C’s which Qantas has introduced on the “Kangaroo
Route” to London can carry up to 14 tons. Only Qantas
operates such aircraft into and out of Australia.
Can you get special low rates with Qantas Air Cargo?
Yes, as a regular or seasonal exporter. You could realise
reductions of between 30% and 60%. What do you
export? Foodstuffs/ Livestock/ Textiles / Metals/ Machin-
ery/Chemicals/Printed Matter/Rubber Products/Precision
Instruments? Recurring exports of these and many other
categories qualify for special low rates.

AROUND MELBOURNE
A Town Like Churchill
Nothing unlawful about Lawless
T ast week your correspondent
walked the streets of Churchill,
the brand new town eight miles from
Morwell in the Latrobe Valley. Actu-
ally, there are no houses yet at
/Churchill. But the streets are very
nice, the gutters clean and well angled
and the footpaths quite beautifully
cemented. The streets, too, are well
labelled, but one feels that the names
are disappointing: Heesom Crescent,
Mclnnes Crescent, Howard Avenue.
One would have thought at the very
least we would have had Montgomery
of Alamein Court, Field-Marshal Alan
Brooke Close and Lord Alexander of
Tunis Boulevard, but maybe that’s the
source of the whole trouble.
You may remember Churchill is the
satellite town for Hazelwood, the £ll7
million power colossus (nigh on five
times the price of the Sydney Opera
House) that the SEC is building by
Morwell. By AD 2000, Churchill,
the model town, will have a popula-
tion of 40,000. State Cabinet thought
of that name Churchill in a gush of
patriotism at the height of the
Churchill appeal.
I mean, it was considered to be a
pretty smart move. There were only
two Churchills in the world, one on
the east coast of Canada in Manitoba
and another in the Irish Free State,
spelt Church Hill.
But State Cabinet entirely over-
looked Mr Tom Lawless, 41, dairy
farmer, father of six, ex-RAAF, RSL
office-bearer. Mr Lawless was pre-
pared to fight in the streets, fight in
the hotel lobbies . . . Hazelwood, said
he, was named after the daughter of
an early pioneer of the district, and
he w'as prepared to fight for 20 years,
if necessary, to have the name perpe-
tuated. He formed the Hazelw'ood
Citizens’ Committee. He took up a
petition of 1100 names, although the
population of the Hazelw'ood area is
only 300. He led deputations, he
made statements.
The Housing Minister, Lindsay
Thompson, called all this the greatest
possible insult to the name of a great
wartime leader. Mr Lawless replied,
“We’re not against Churchill. We’re
only for Hazelwood”. The Housing
Commission put up two utterly
beautiful 30 ft by 12 ft billboards,
designed to announce to the world
that this was Churchill. According to
Mr Lawless they cost £3OO each. Then
Mr Lawless counter-attacked by put-
ting a large HAZELWOOD sign on
the Shire Hall.
Last week members of both Houses
of State Parliament went on a tour
of the Latrobe Valley at the invitation
of the SEC. Mr Lawless and his merry
men were ready and waiting. As soon
as the train pulled into Yaliourn he
dashed on ahead to Churchill and
put up a handsome wooden sign in
front of the £3OO Housing Com-
mission Churchill billboard:
“HELP RESTORE HAZEL-
WOODS NAME.”
The honorable members went by
bus to Churchill escorted by a police
patrol car. The leader of the Labor
Opposition, Clive Stoneham, said he
noted with interest that the Liberal
and Country Party members needed
police protection to save them from
the angry local population. However,
the Hazelwood committee did nothing
rash. Mr Lawless even pointed out that
as the committee’s protest sign was on
Housing Commission property it
would have to come down at the end
of the day. There’s nothing unlawful
about Mr Lawless.
There was a deputation to the par-
liamentarians after lunch at the La-
trobe Valley Hotel, but all the time
Mr Arthur Hare, president of the
Morwell Shire, was hovering in the
background. He told your correspon-
dent: “Look here, already there’s a
Hazelwood Power Station. There’s a
Hazelwood North, a Hazelwood
South, a Hazelwood Football Ground,
a Hazelwood Estate, a Hazelwood
Parish, and I’m chairman of trustees
of the Hazlewood Cemetery. Then
you know where I live? Yes, Hazel-
wood Street, Morwell. I’m sick of
Hazelwood. Let's have a change.”
Mr Lawless says that, as sure as the
rising of the sun, all those names will
be absorbed by Churchill. “Look,” he
says, “it’s happening already. The
latest Shell map mentions nothing else
but Churchill.” One feels for Mr Law-
less, but the odds are against him.
Housing Minister Thompson, the one
man who can change all this, was a
very obvious absentee from the ex-
pedition. There is little doubt that
Churchill will never surrender.
Put across the way from Churchill,
the power station of Hazelwood is
quite awe-inspiring. At this stage it is
one-quarter finished, and the chim-
neys rise to 450 feet. Only the chimney
at Mt Isa is taller. The boilers, to cope
with the damp brown coal, have to be
extra large and there will be eight of
these, 200 feet high, each about the
size of Melbourne’s ICI Building. The
total output will be 2+ million kilo-
watts. Each of those eight boilers
will guzzle up the brown coal at the
rate of 300 tons an hour, shovelled in
on moving belts from the open cut
over yonder.
But there’s an interesting point. By
tradition, nobody ever talks of coal-
mining in the valley. Mining is a
dirty word, always associated with that
much-feared Miners’ Federation. At
Yaliourn and Morwell one wins coal.
You see, the Government does not
employ miners; most of the men are
members of the AWU.
Guess who was to wrestle at Ker-
not Hall, Monash Square, Yaliourn,
this past Monday night . . . Pat
Mackie, complete with his red baseball
cap. It was his first wrestle in his
great comeback. His opponent was
Dr A 1 Woods of Sydney. Local experts
pointed out that the doctor was a
fairly evil fellow but Pat was work-
ing up to the tough ones gently. But
over at Hazelwood, and even in
Churchill, folk were hoping that Pat
wasn’t planning to form a Council
for Membership Control of the AWU
(Latrobe Valley Chapter) between
rounds.

The 6 Best Years of Your Life?
The Modest Revolution in Primary Schools
By WILLIAM HANNAN
He starts his primary schooling when
he is five. He spends six or
seven years at it in grades with 40
or more children all of the same age. He
is promoted annually. He is taught by
a system best described as the class-
teaching system—one teacher takes him
for all his work at each level.
This is the primary schooling of the
typical Australian. Most people seem to
think this organisation quite satisfactory.
It is the system we nearly all went
through (except perhaps for the annual
promotion). Yet in the next few years
we may see the passing of this time-
honored system. Ungraded schools, as
opposed to age-grade schools, are com-
mon overseas, and are now being ex-
perimented with here in at least three
State systems, as well as some private
schools. In New South Wales the ex-
periment is a large one involving 53
schools. Western Australia and Victoria
each have only a handful of State schools
involved (Mt Pleasant, Brunswick North,
Altona) but their effect could be just as
far-reaching.
Supporters of ungrading have more
than American models to inspire them.
Their weightiest influences are the find-
ings of a conference convened by the
Australian Council of Educational Re-
search on the topic: “Individual differ-
ences between children and their impli-
cations for primary school organisation”
(subsequently published by ACER as
“Each One is Different", edited by Pro-
fessor G. W. Bassett). According to the
conference the universal system of age-
grading should be abandoned for a much
more flexible grouping. The chief trouble
with age-grading, as almost any teacher
will tell you, is that the dull remain, dull,
even though they're promoted, and the
bright are not pushed far enough. Large
classes magnify the mediocrity of the
process.
An ungraded school, like Brunswick
North Experimental School in Mel-
bourne, divides the day in half for grades
four, five and six. In the morning they
take English, Spelling and Mathematics
in ability groups with their home teacher.
In the afternoon they take Social Studies,
Science, Music, Art and Physical Edu-
cation in age-groups with specialist teach-
ers. The reason for the division is that
the first group of subjects develop skills
progressively and can be assessed by
graded tests, whereas the second group
consists of more expansive subjects which
children of varying ability can work at
together, each doing his best. Since
children do not fall into neat ability of
40 or so, class size is still a major prob-
lem, but the extremes of dull and bright
are probably better looked after. A
good child, for instance, could be several
grades ahead in Mathematics and profit
from the stimulation of equally advanced
or older children, but for the rest of the
day have the social advantage of mixing
with his own age-groyp and the demo-
cratic advantage of having to mix with
children of lesser ability.
Ungrading is only one of the drastic
changes either in operation in primary
schools or on the researchers’ books. Re-
organised or not, our primary schools are
teaching new work in new ways. With
the speed of social and technological
change in their community it would be
dismaying if they were not. In large
educational systems like ours most
changes are made in response to
changing social demands. To teachers
now the most pressing of these demands
is for adaptability.
Traditionally the primary school has
provided basic literacy. It still does, but
we disagree more now about what is
basic. Rods, poles and perches may in-
deed have been essential to the full life
when Australia was being surveyed, but
today we need people who understand
mathematical laws. Long tots were pro-
bably enriching exercises for the human
ancestors of adding machines; today the
sixth-grader’s mathematics is enriched by
experience of number systems other than
the decimal.
No modern teaching aid is more sym-
bolic of the new primary school (at least
to Australian parents) than the multi-
colored Cuisenaire rods. There have been
public meetings of parents demanding
that they be introduced, innumerable
complaints from teachers that they have
not been trained in using them, and
some head-shaking that the arts of addi-
tion have been lost.
Teaching aids, like Cuisenaire, lan-
guage laboratories, films and so forth,
appeal to parents’ imagination. They
see their children in a busy, glittering
classroom. It could be more profitable
to them and their children if they en-
quired into the aims and methods of the
teaching these aids are used with,
Cuisenaire rods, for instance, along with
several other mathematical aids based
on similar principles, are not meant to
produce greater facility in mechanical
calculating. They only become real aids
when teaching emphasises creative en-
quiry into mathematical principles.


Every child starts school with some
pre-number experience, such as the
difference between big and small. In the
infant classes the Cuisenaire rods make
his experience larger and more precise.
To begin with, he plays with the rods—
making patterns with them.- Until num-
bers are attached to the rods, the child
is actually learning algebra. As he pro-
gresses he learns and experiments with
the fundamental laws of arithmetic which
are the basis of mathematics. When he
can reason without the rods, or blocks,
or scales, he puts the aid aside. For
new work he usually returns to the aid as
a concrete illustration of what he must
ultimately abstract.
So the aid provides an environment for
creative work in mathematics. Children
now are asked to write their own mathe-
matics. They do not passively apply
rote formulas if they happen to know
them. A child may be asked, for instance,
to write down all the interesting things he
can about the number 72. He may start
with 72 equals 72 X 1. If he knows his
principles he may express the 1 as 8
over 8. A grade two child in a Victorian
school expressed it as:
1 53
72 = of 1 -f 71
54 54
This sort of work quite clearly stresses
analysis of principles and methods. It
aims to prepare children for more com-
plicated work than shopping, paper-
hanging and planting annular lawns. It
assumes that many more children will
learn and use higher mathematics in
their lives, and that everyone should
know something of the principles on
which so much of our technical progress
depends.
The same aims are obvious in the new
science courses being prepared. Every
subject is a mixture of fact and method,
but in teaching it is the emphasis that
counts. To teachers brought up in the
Australian tradition it is sorely tempting
to stuff a child with facts that can be
periodically examined. Secondary edu-
cation works on this principle. The most
recent material and curricula in science,
however, try to make enquiry methods
more important than facts. In any case
from the huge store of scientific fact any
choice would, be arbitrary. So when
children are to be tested they are more
likely to be given some unknown bug and
asked what they would try to find out
about it and how they would find it
out. Such courses in scientific ideas and
experimental methods are being designed,
and will eventually replace nature study,
not without a quiet tear from some of
us older bird-lovers and bush ramblers.
The most controversial job of the pri-
mary schools is to teach English—read-
ing first, then writing and spelling. It is
controversial, because most people have
hazy or wrong notions of what the final
result should be. When secondary teach-
ers berate primary teachers for neglect,
or university teachers flay secondary
teachers for incompetence or employers
bemoan the past, their complaints may be
about something as trivial as spelling or
they may be pointing to serious illiteracy.
If it is- the latter they should remember
that literacy is a relative idea. It is more
common among theorists today to talk
of functional literacy rather than of bare
literacy. The idea is simply that people’s
command of language must increase as
the community’s life and work become
more complex, which it is doing. If the
new office girl is a dolt, it may be that
the school has been negligent; but it may
also mean that the job has so changed
that she should have stayed at school
longer. Perhaps 20 years ago the job
didn’t exist at all. Remember, too, that
this problem of understanding and using
language affects her probably more as a
person and a citizen than as a job-
seeker. Even if she doesn't realise this,
which has probably given her disability,
the education system must.
The primary schools take most of the
burden of this preparation. If they fail
the student is seldom redeemed later.
So it is not surprising that the basic skill,
reading, has been and is the subject of
innumerable experiments.
i.t.a.
T anguage is a fearfully difficult thing
to teach. It is true to say that no one
teaching it knows enough about it to be
sure of his methods. Every experiment
draws ready-made attacks, every argu-
ment founders on sentiment or ignor-
ance. For years English teaching con-
sisted of phonics, reading aloud, spelling,
dictation, composition and grammar.
Now it is believed that phonics are useful
but limited, silent reading is more useful
than reading aloud, spelling is mostly
picked up from reading and writing, dic-
tation is irrelevant except as a test, com-
position should be free and creative, and
grammar is not only useless but wrong.
Furthermore, the classroom is only one
of the places where language is learnt,
which explains why so many succeed,
and fail, irrespective of the school’s
methods.
Nonetheless, most children depend on
the school in the early stages of reading,
and the bottom third or half continue to
depend a lot on good teaching. Most
current experiments are in reading tech-
niques for beginners.
The most publicised reading experi-
ment is with Sir James Pitman’s Initial
Teaching Alphabet. Great claims have
been made for it in England, and every
State here aims to experiment with it.
i.t.a. (its capitals are simply bigger ver-
sions of lower case) comprises forty-four
characters, one for each of the phonemes
of English. Unlike most phonemic
alphabets it is very easy to read because
its top “coast-line” is almost the same
as that of the normal alphabet. This, of
course, doesn’t interest the beginner.
What he has is the satisfaction of know-
ing that each character represents only
one sound. He quickly learns to read,
they say, and moreover can read any
book which suits his vocabulary range,
rather than having to plod through stuff
whose ideas are restricted arbitrarily by
spelling. The “coast-line” does become
important, however, when he has to
change to conventional spelling. If, for
example, the bottom half of this line of
type is covered, the line (or top coast-
line) can still be read. Since i.t.a. charac-
ters are deliberately similar to normal
type, the change to conventional spelling
is said to be fairly painless. Local re-
searchers are still dubious, but British
experience so far has impressed them.
Another recent device to overcome the
sound-spelling problem is Dr Gattegno’s
“Words in Color”. Dr C. Gattegno, a
brilliant teacher now about 50 who has
done most of his work in England (and
has visited Australia four times), is
famous for his preaching of Cuisenaire
and his language aid exploits color in a
similar way. With this, children learn to
identify sounds and their spellings by
working through colored charts where
each sound is associated with a color.
Both this and i.t.a. attempt to solve the
phonic problem so that the young reader
can get on with the more advanced, and
perhaps more important, skill of reading
whole phrases as units of thought.
These methods are now being experi-
mented with on a large scale, which sug-
gests that they will soon be commonly
used. State Departments are cautiously
expanding their i.t.a . experiments: Vic-
toria, for instance, started with one
school in Warrnambool last year, and
this year increased to four. Dr Gat-
tegno’s materials are also reported, to be
used in about 140 schools throughout all
States, mostly in Victoria (about 70) and
New South Wales (about 50). His words
in color have the advantage over i.t.a. of
involving no big readjustment to ordinary
spelling. Some who use his materials
have reported very enthusiastically on
them.
Even so, there are many primary
schools, and the standard method in
beginners’ classes is a combination of the
“phonic method” (teaching individual
sounds and their spellings) and the “sen-
tence method” (teaching overall recogni-
tion of complete word groups). To the
child for whom the sounds of “a” in the
sentence “All was dark and many hares
raced round the village” is an insuper-
able barrier, i.t.a. or some other aid may
be a godsend. Because there are many
such children, experiments must go on.
Beyond the infant school, English still
remains the most important and, because

of its complexity, the worst-taught sub-
ject. Graded reading programmes (of
which the SRA Reading Laboratory is
the best known) are now commonly used
and certainly seem to have solved some
of the problems of persuading 40 or
so children to keep reaching ahead in
their understanding of the written word.
Spelling techniques are becoming more
efficient. The teaching of grammatical
rules has been replaced by more volu-
minous and more exciting exercises in
writing as a means of expression. But
there are still big holes in the system.
Methods like these need good basic
readers, massive libraries and teachers
with time to spend on individuals. Our
primary schools have none of these.
Parsimony
Tn fact wherever you turn in a primary
school you will see the same problems.
The main one is that there aren’t enough
teachers. It is often assumed that new
techniques, like programmed learning,
will overcome the shortage, but now that
some programmes are being tried, it is
being found that all that changes is the
type of work the teacher does. The pro-
gramme, with its careful step-by-step
progression and self-correcting tricks,
certainly relieves the teacher of mechani-
cal drilling in English and Mathematics,
but he realises as soon as he gets the
chance to mix with the class that there
are dozens of other problems to be
settled which perhaps he’d never noticed
before. Once children start to move at
their own pace they spread out. Much
more varied and enriching work is
needed for the bright, and closer atten-
tion must be given to the dull and the
unwilling. This cannot be done in groups
of 40. However, if the claims of both
teachers and their administrators in every
State about the ideal class size were
taken seriously, the number of classrooms
and teachers in Australia would have to
be nearly doubled.
Besides being too few, the teachers are
not adequately trained. A typical teacher
has had either 11 or 12 years of school-
ing and, depending on his age, one or
two years of training in a State-run
teachers’ college. He is obliged to get
further qualifications in his spare time,
but if the qualification is a university
degree he is quickly out of the classroom
into a teachers’ college or an inspector-
ate. Most of the teachers being asked
to take the new mathematics courses,
or who may be asked to teach scientific
method, stopped learning these things in
the middle of secondary school. Even
those few with a good background need
in-service training in the many new con-
cepts of knowledge being introduced.
The best they get are brief workshops
and long circulars.
Both these weaknesses, of supply and
training, will have to be remedied quickly.
In the early ’fifties a population bulge
caught every State Government fast
asleep. That generation is now reprodu-
cing itself and will have its children into
the schools by the ’seventies. State De-
partments this time are aware of their
coming problems and do at least have
plans to raise entrance qualifications to
teachers’ colleges and lengthen training
to three years. Whether they have parallel
plans for improving the quality of the
training, for giving better in-service train-
ing, or for controlling their teachers
more liberally is unknown.
Yet the attitudes of State Departments
to their primary school teachers will
affect the progress of the children in the
schools. The Australian tradition of
tight central control of schools, which
still characterises all States, undoubtedly
has advantages. It ensures reasonable
equality of services in every area
(although States like Victoria, which
subsidise money raised by parents for
essential services like libraries, still have
inferior schools in the poor suburbs) and
it permits wholesale rapid changes in
courses and methods. On the other
hand, our large State Departments have
some notable failures to their discredit.
Chief among these is their failure to
gain the confidence not only of their own
teachers but also of parents. The failure
of politicians, for instance, to find
enough money for education appears
often to be defended by their permanent
administrators. Departmental parsimony
is notorious, in simple affairs like supply-
ing duplicating paper to an experimental
school which needs to run off its own
work sheets and programmes. The fear
of unfavorable inspection and loss of
promotion produces in teachers the con-
servatism they despise in the Department.
The Departments have failed similarly
with parents. Mothers’ clubs and parent
associations raise a lot of money for im-
portant equipment, yet the tone of De-
partmental dealings with them is the
usual cool, official, regulation-quoting
one. Moreover it has mostly been left
haphazardly to odd schools to tell parents
what the school aims to do.
The idea that education is the affair of
Education Departments and teachers is
still very strong. Parents actively help-
ing the school are given only menial
jobs, while the rest are occasionally
treated to ineffectual displays of books,
charts and equipment. A growing num-
ber of schools now believe that parents
should be given a more precise under-
standing of what the school aims to do
and why. Usually this is done through
regular meetings where education, rather
than money-raising, is discussed. This
approach to parents could be the most
important experiment of all, for however
good a child’s schooling may be, his
education still mostly depends on his
home.

ON THE MARGIN
The future of Them
T>ritain is taking a more tolerant view
** of homosexuals than in the past.
The House of Lords has given Them a
green light, although the Commons still
flashes red. This shift of opinion, I
think, could easily become world-wide,
for a good reason the extraordinary
amount of trouble that is being caused
by heterosexuals.
Consider the. gloomy prediction made
by a Russian professor. By AD 2500,
he says, there will be so many people
on the earth that they will have only
two square yards of ground each. That
is what the reproductive mania is leading
us to. The picture of a football crowd
covering the entire globe is very un-
pleasant. But while most of us merely
talk about the problem, homosexuals do
something about it. They have opted out
of the reproduction business.
By taking this drastic course They
miss some family-type fun, but arguably
They are performing an impor-
tant service for humanity. The
world outlook would be much
brighter if only enough Chinese
would go over to Them.
It is time for people at large
to stop calling Them unkind
names and judge Them on Their
merits. As a general rule Their
cultural level is above the aver-
age. Dante drew attention to this
when he described the homo-
sexual department of Hell as
being full of eminent men of
letters (including his old classics
teacher).
I do not want to belittle heterosexual
achievements—some of my best friends
are heterosexuals. But I must say that
over the years I have met more hetero-
sexual bores than the other kind.
The way homosexuals live affords
special opportunities for cultural and
social activity. They do not have to
spend Their spare time reading “The
Story of the Three Bears”, or helping
with geometry homework. With relatively
few bills to pay, They can afford the
gracious things of life—theatres, oysters,
LP records. They are able to move
around, often to other countries, with-
out the encumbrance of wives or child-
ren. Homosexuals travel light.
Much of the ill-will shown towards
Them by conventional folk is due to
envy. I saw an example of it in a
friend of mine whom I shall call Wil-
liams. He is a typical middle-class
heterosexual, living uncomfortably on a
comfortable income.
“I just can’t get ahead,” he com-
plained. “School fees, ballet fees, kinder-
garten fees, clothes, shoes, tennis
racquets, holidays.” At the other end of
the bar Williams saw a smartly dressed
interior decorator. He said sourly:
“There goes the happy homo
He doesn’t give a damn.
I wish 1 were a homo
Instead of what l am.”
However, that is a biased opinion.
Most homosexuals are not as happy as
jaundiced heteros think They should be.
There is too much prejudice against
Them.
The most unenviable are those known
as Hartleyists, who have ambiguous
tastes. The name is derived from the
poem beginning:
There was a young fellow named
Hartley ,
Not wholly perverted but partly.
Hartleyists were common in
antiquity. According to Cicero,
Mark Antony was one, although
the point is not stressed in the
film Cleopatra. It did not matter
much in those days, but it does
now. The unfortunate Hartleyist
incurs the expenses of a family
man as well as the social risks of
one of Them.
For the more single-minded of
Them there is the sheer tedium
of popular entertainment. They
have to put up with scores of
novels and films dealing with
repellently normal relationships.
They listen to endless songs on the
radio extolling distasteful boy-and-girl
romances. It is to the credit of homo-
sexuals that They never complain about
this state of affairs.
People criticise Them for having un-
natural impulses, although natural im-
pulses are causing the population
explosion that threatens the world. They
could very well reply: “Look who’s talk-
ing!” But They endure it in stoical
silence.
By AD 2500, perhaps, when every-
body is elbowing everybody else at a
vast football final all over the earth,
there will be more appreciation of the
homosexual point of view. Indeed, it
will not be surprising if the doomed
crowd sings: “For They are jolly good
fellows!”
ROSS CAMPBELL


The Inside Dopesters
Canberra’s fourth estate
By BRIAN JOHNS
There is no more self-contained
group in that most circular of
places, the national capital, than
the 50-odd members of the Parliamentary
Press gallery. The chap talking to the
political journalist in a corner of the
wide sweep of the King’s Hall lobby in
Parliament House is most probably an-
other political journalist; the clutch
standing closest to the drinks table at
a reception in the determinedly old-
fashioned, dining-room of the Canberra
Hotel almost invariably will be journal-
ists; talking of the free-loading Tate of
other- journalists; the -non-members
crowding the non-members’ bar in the
bowels of Parliament will mostly be
journalists, swapping stories with other
journalists. If, by chance, an outsider
—it does happen—is a party to the
conversations at any of these places,
he might be puzzled as to just why
journalists like their own company best.
He could well be more puzzled as to
how those columns of Canberra news
he reads in his daily paper get there.
One journalist talking to another, per-
haps?
In a way this is what does happen. The
great bulk of the news coming out of
Canberra is pre-packaged. The packag-
ing comes in the form of Press releases,
handouts from the growing band of Mini-
sters’ Press secretaries, departmental
public relations officers, the lobbyists
frequently former public servants of
the Chambers of Manufactures, the As-
sociated Chambers of Commerce, the
RSL, and the rest. As well, the political
journalist will have an ever-increasing
shoal of Government publications, re-
ports many with convenient summa-
ries of the “relevant” material Em-
bassy publications, offered for use “with-
out acknowledgement”; and even Army
and Navy newspapers from which to
lift material. All of this pours into the
series of pigeon-hole boxes at the top
of the stairway on the first-floor loft of
Parliament House. The pigeon-holes
are within seconds of the crummy offices
provided by Parliament on a grace-and-
favor basis for the “working”. journalist
a trade phrase distinguishing them
from the band of P.R.O.s who provide
the voluminous amounts of material. And
just in case-the journalists are not aware
of the latest news delivery, there is a
buzzer next to the boxes which, at a
press, will cause the closest thing to a
“scramble for news” to be seen on most
days in the Press gallery.
However, relations between the Gov-
ernment P.R.O.s and the Press gallery
are far from easy. The gallery—divided
itself into a three-tier caste of “heads of
service” (political correspondents), “per-
manents” and the floating population of
“sessionals” who report the Parliamen-
tary debates affect a disdain for the
P.R.O.’s role. Yet somehow there is more
than a sprinkling of former gallery mem-
bers to be found in the PR ranks, w'hich
are now more easily closed because of
the advantages of secure employment
and, for the most part, regular hours.
The gallery places a jealous guard on
its membership and its rights of protocol.
(Some years ago when Government
House had to make a choice of who
should head the precedence list to meet
the Governor-General, the gallery presi-
dent—elected by permanents and coming
traditionally from the ranks of “the heads
of service” —took the nod from the then
proprietor of “The Canberra Times”,
Mr A. T. Shakespeare.) Recently, when
it was reported that a new gallery mem-
ber, a freelancer, was doing publicity
work for the Labor Party, he was called
on by the gallery committee to show
that the greater part of his earnings came
from his newspaper writings. In fact, the
most practical benefits of gallery mem-
bership (almost exclusively a male pre-
serve), and head of service ranking in
particular, are the opportunities for free-
loading at cocktail parties and receptions.
There is, 'of course, the right to attend
the annual gallery dinner without
wives or friends and see the brawl,
which usually crowns that social occa-
sion.
Old gallery hands will sometimes com-
plain about the controlled news of the
handout system which was given a
mighty thrust by the decision of the
Menzies Government, soon after it came
to power, to have departmental news is-
sued through the Government Public
Relations Officer at Parliament House.
Nevertheless, when “The Australian”
broke an embargo a great many of
the press statements have a specific re-
lease time so that the papers can all have
them together—there were howls from
old and young that it was a threat to
the whole handout system.
Certainly, the handout system, as any
departmental P.R.O. will testify, has
made the traditional newspaper species,
the roundsmen, almost extinct amongst
the national Press in Canberra. In some
ways newspapers themselves have made
the extension of the handout system in-
evitable. Most of the Canberra offices of
metropolitan dailies are under-staffed
and none has really kept pace with
the growth of Canberra as a news centre.
Leaving aside “The Canberra Times”
and “The Australian” which, because
they are situated in Canberra, necessarily
have wider staff resources (although “The
Canberra Times” when it was owned by
Mr Shakespeare did not even maintain
a staff man in Parliament but merely
relied on the news provided by the Aus-
tralian United Press, which services most
provincial papers), the largest offices are
maintained by “The Daily Telegraph”
(six) the ABC (six) and “The Sydney
Morning Herald” (five). A number of
the interstate papers are satisfied with
one-man bureaux. The degree of special-
isation in all offices is scant: it is
mainly a case of “Our Political Cor-
respondent”, and the “rest”. The latter do
the tedious processing of handouts, cover
conventions and conferences, local courts,
and, between times, give cursory attention
to those departments which leader-writ-
ers now are so quick to judge as the real

seats of Government power. It is no ac-
cident that the most formidable men in
the gallery are to be found among those
with most time to specialise. The gallery
veteran, Alan Reid, one of the handful
who regularly, or even irregularly, pro-
duce scoops, is the only man in the gal-
lery who can range for stories unfettered
by office responsibilities and daily routine
assignments.
Another who “breaks” news is the Fal-
staffian-figure, lan Fitchett of “The Syd-
ney Morning Herald”, the character of
the gallery. But, like “The Age’s” John
Bennetts or the other “heads of service”,
Fitchett could not be described as a
specialist. In any one day they can be
expected to speak with equal authority
on the economy, external affairs, de-
fence —the gamut of major, and in many
cases, minor news coming out of Can-
berra. It is an impossible task. The ABC
news bureau, hardly the most venture-
some organisation, broke new ground
several years ago by appointing a “Diplo-
matic Correspondent”. When it began,
“The Australian” embarked on an
ambitious programme of specialisation,
which to some extent has persisted.
Gallery cynics laughed into the froth of
their beers at “The Australian’s” early
nomenclature of Defence, Diplomatic,
Parliamentary, Trade, and even Lobby
correspondents.
The Club
gallery has long had its own method
of rationalising duties the club
system with which Australia’s rare stu-
dents of the Press would do well to
familiarise themselves. “The Club”,
which has associate membership, is a
complicated system of exchanging news
in an attempt to ensure that major stories
are not missed. The system is not fool-
proof. Some papers are outside it —“The
Age”, the “Telegraph”, and “The Aus-
tralian” (which has its own “club”, with
the “Mirror”). There are also the risks
of friction causing a breakdown in the
exchanges, as happened a fortnight ago
over a scoop ALP story appearing in
“The Sydney Morning Herald”. Such
friction has, in the past, caused align-
ments to be changed and non-club mem-
bers were amused to see gallery men
from one paper out and about as a result
of the recent breach.
The club network is “The Sydney
Morning Herald”, “Melbourne Sun”,
“Adelaide Advertiser”, “West Australian”
and “Courier-Mail” exchanging their
stories. Feeding into the system on an
associate membership basis are the
Sydney “Sun”, Melbourne “Herald” and
Brisbane “Telegraph”. There have been
pacts among the non-club members', and
crossing the network lines .at any stage
are personal arrangements for exchanges

between journalists. (Adding to the com-
plications of just who did find the news
story above the byline is the habit, not
unknown in the gallery, of a head of
service “taking over” a story from a staff
member: it is on record that one head
of service had his byline appearing over
stories for a fortnight of his annual
leave.)
The union covering journalists, the
AJA, is always wary of official news
pools, through fear that they will reduce
the number of jobs. However, if basic
Canberra news, such as Parliament (six
officers are in fact now taking a common
service on debates), were covered by one
news service, as happens for example in
Washington, journalists would have a
greater opportunity to provide back-
ground and comment, and to go beyond
surface facts. It would provide time for
a genuine cover of that most neglected
area of Government, the Commonwealth
Public Service.
In his recent address to the Inter-
national Press Institute in London, Walter
Lippman observed that a major test for
journalists is “the conflict between their
pursuit of truth and their need and desire
to be on good terms with the powerful.”
Canberra must be one of the most test-
ing areas on this score. Overseas journa-
lists visiting Canberra are habitually
shocked at the tightness of news sources
in the national capital. The Prime Minis-
ter, Sir Robert Menzies, exercises a re-
markable control over “leaks” from the
source of major news Cabinet. On
occasion, he has gone so far as to cross-
examine each member of the Cabinet
about a news leak. In this atmosphere it
is not surprising that Australian Cabinet
Ministers are unusually remote from
journalists, and frequently are not even
prepared to discuss an issue with the
Press. (A few have adopted the habit of
having a member of their staff present
during an interview with a journalist.)
The Powerful
/Government backbenchers have in-
herited this attitude that the Press is
inevitably their enemy, and the situation
is even more severe in the Public Service,
particularly the higher echelons. This
Canberra situation accents the political
journalist’s habitual temptation to flirt
with “the powerful”. And falls from grace
are not hard to recognise, particularly in
the comment-pieces, of which there are
all too few. It happens that journalists
go beyond the favored-treatment stage
sometimes the corollary of having a
point-of-view as much as opportunism
into straight-out political dealing. This
ranges from the vicious knifing of “the
powerful’s” political enemies, to keeping
his rival’s name out of print. One politi-
cal correspondent for a period of months
recently dropped a leading politician’s
name from all his comment, even to the
extent of not mentioning the politician’s
name when a committee of which he
was a member was under discussion.
The difficulty of penetrating the Gov-
ernment’s curtain on news is a good
reason why Labor figures so prominently
in the Press. Journalists are generally
taken to be Labor supporters, although
it is fair to wonder if this impression is
not exaggerated by the ever-ready excuse
that they write what they do because
“that’s the way the boss wants it”.
When the Party meetings are being held
in Canberra on Wednesday morning, it
is interesting to see the cluster of jour-
nalists at the entrance to a Labor lobby
waiting for Caucus to end as against the
two or three at the Government side.
Similarly, a meeting of the ALP Federal
executive ensures an overflow crowd at
the secretariat in Ainslie Avenue; but
only three journalists arrived at the Hotel
Canberra for the Country Party con-
ference and one left before the dele-
gates broke up because he looked like
being late home for lunch.

A Leaning Towards Lear
Perry Mason’s last case
By SAM LIPSKI
R\ymond Burr, television’s Perry
Mason, would meet the Press, the
hotel’s public relations man ex-
plained. But he wanted to know the
names of those who would be interview-
ing him and who, as it turned out, would
be eating his king prawns, liverwurst,
lobster, smoked -salmon, salami, smoked
meats, caviare, cole slaw and asparagus
stalks. There was a drink-waiter, too.
Mr Burr is a considerate and genial
host. He proffered chairs for photo-
graphers, sat imperturbably while they
popped the flashes in his face, taped a
10-second greeting for one of the Good
Guys and politely, if often perfunctorily,
answered all the questions—well, nearly
all of them.
True, he did unchivalrously back away
from an advancing woman journalist.
But this was not annoyance, he politely
told her, but the ’flu, caught somewhere
between Vietnam and Sydney.
This had been the fourth time Burr
had been in Vietnam. The third time,
in December last year, he had broken
his arm, in circumstances which he in-
sisted were “classified”. It had healed.
On this most recent trip he had shaken
the hands of 20,000 servicemen. He
had found morale “excellent” and that
the troops were confident of winning.
“But what winning means over there is
something else again. What they did feel
was that they needed more support. The
line's been spread awfully thin there,
until recently.”
Burr had gone to Vietnam to entertain
troops, but since he spoke knowledgeably
about “military logistics” and the stability
of the Government in Saigon, it seemed
appropriate to ask him if actors were
becoming more deeply involved in
American political life nowadays. A
post-Kennedy phenomenon? “Not really.
They've been involved in politics for a
long time, especially in Californian
politics. Personally, I have never entered
politics so to speak. I have never
declared myself Republican or Demo-
crat.”
Burr has declared himself on the
case of Perry Mason. This is the end.
After nine years of working an 18-hour
day during filming of the series, after
making scores of speeches annually to
bar associations and law faculties, after
defending a civil case of his own in court
(he lost), he wants to return to the
theatre, to appear in more films, and to
do some television spectaculars. “I also
want to do a musical. I used to be a
singer. In fact, that’s how I started off.
I’ve also asked three composers to do
symphonic scores for background music
to recordings of Shakespeare’s sonnets.
They’ve never been done and they con-
tain some of the best —and worst —of
Shakespeare’s writing.”
This was not the case of the defence
counsel who wanted to play Hamlet.
Burr played Hamlet, Othello and Rich-
ard 111 before he ever met Paul Drake
or Stella. Yet, one great Shakespearian
role, King Lear, still awaits him if he is
right about his attitude to the role. “Only
an actor in his fifties or sixties can play
Lear properly.” At 48, he could wait for
a whole series of Perry Mason re-runs
to have come and gone before he
attempts the part.
How was it then that, in the midst
of the movement towards “serious” tele-
vision—“ The Defenders”, “Naked City”
and “East Side, West Side”—the Perry
Mason formula had remained immune
and yet continually successful for nine
years?
“Well, most of those social problem
shows have folded. I think it’s because
they ran out of problems, and started
creating them where none existed before.
Besides it’s OK to present a problem,
but what I would like to see are some
solutions. People have too many prob-
lems of their own for them to want to
see more on television.”
Courteously eager to answer any
questions about his interests away from
television —he cares for 20 orphans
around the world, under the American
charity plan of Foster Parents —he
hedged on the question of Australian
art. Known to be something of a col-
lector, with his own galleries in Arizona
and New Mexico, he could not be pinned
down on his current interests.
“Until about 15 years ago Australian
art had fallen into a pattern from which
it then broke away. That doesn’t mean,
by the way, I'm interested only, or even
mainly, in abstract art, I like mostly
representational work.”
But specifically, had he bought any
paintings on his 36-hour stopover in
Sydney? But, diplomatically, “I am
afraid I have been confined to my hotel
for the two days that I am here. But I
am negotiating for the purchase of a
new group of paintings from a number
of Australian artists. When the deal has
reached consummation I’ll be happy
to tell you who the artists are.”

Long-term
Best-seller
Breaking into British
publishing
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Mr Geoffrey Chapman is at
present in Australia to promote
one of his own publishing firm’s
best-sellers, “Journal of a Soul”, the
diaries of the late Pope John XXIII.
This has proved a light task, as the
“Journal” is currently selling at the rate
of 1000 a week in Britain alone. By the
end of the year Mr Chapman, whose
firm holds the English-speaking world
rights to the book, expects it to have sold
75,000 in the British Commonwealth and
100,000 in the United States.
These figures, Mr Chapman pointed
out, have not been achieved by placing
a copy in every convent. Overseas it
was selling to Protestants as well as
Catholics, or, rather, to the all-embracing
“non-Catholics”.
Mr Chapman said that his firm paid
royalties to the Italian publisher,
Edizioni di Storia Litteratura. He has no
idea who eventually gets the author’s
percentage or what use the money is
put to. He believes “Journal of a Soul”
will remain in print to the end of the
century. His firm holds the English-
speaking paperback rights, but he is in
no hurry, at the moment, to exercise
them.
Mr Chapman, a law graduate of Mel-
bourne University, hastened to add that
“Journal of a Soul” wasn’t entirely the
lucky, longed-for break which his young
publishing house had been looking for.
He began eight years ago, with no
previous publishing experience and with
something like £lOO capital in unfashion-
able Wimbledon, on the outer rim of
London. “We have been going near to
doubling our sales every year since,”
he said. “We are now probably the
largest explicitly Roman Catholic pub-
lisher in the British Commonwealth.
One other firm might still just top us, but
I’d like to see their latest figures.”
Although, so far, Mr Chapman has
published mostly books by Roman
Catholic authors, he insists he is a “pro-
fessional publisher and not a professional
Catholic”. One of his firm’s gestures
towards ecumenism is to use the re-
vised standard version of the Bible for
texts.
Although Mr Chapman’s firm pub-
lishes a good many translations of
European books, he is not prepared to


concede that all the progressive thought
on Catholicism is coming out of France
and Germany, “although they seem to
think it is”, he added. He believes that
American Catholics are writing some of
the best stuff and has recently added
Courtney Murray to his list. “It’s simply
that the American Catholic community
has grown up,” he said. “Fifty years
ago all they were worried about was
keeping heir people off the liquor and
sc on, but now American Catholics are
mature and capable of mature thought.
I hope Australian Catholics are growing
up, too.”
Classed as sprinters
Tn spite of his hopes, Mr Chapman has
few Australians on his list. He classes
them as sprinters—good at article length,
but not able easily to survive book
length.
One of his Australians is a former
staff member of The Bulletin, Des-
mond O’Grady, now living in Rome.
His “Eat from God’s Hand” will be
published in England in September. It
is an account of the life and work of Paul
Gauthier, a French secular priest, who is
living and working among the poor, both
Jews and Arabs, of Israel. Mr O'Grady
lived for a month in Israel to gather
material for his book. Geoffrey Chap-
man has already published Father
Gauthier's own book, “Christ, the
Church and the Poor”.
Mr Chapman has strong hopes that
what might be an all-time best-seller will
come out of Australia. This is the new
catechism for Roman Catholic children,
commissioned by the Australian bishops
and written by Dr Kelly, of Melbourne.
It has already been in use in Australia
for two years.
Mr Chapman has secured publication
rights for England, Ireland, the West
Indies and parts of Africa. He said it
was better adapted than the new German
catechism to the point of view of a
child and might become universally
used. “I believe the bishops come in for
a lot of criticism, but this is one of the
good things they have done,” he said.
Mr Chapman said that when he left
Australia his intention had been only to
learn as much as he could about pub-
lishing, then come back here and apply
his knowledge. After looking around
here now, he has it at the back of
his mind to open up here in five years’
time as a general publisher.
“Publishing here has gone ahead and
there are some very enterprising people
in it,” he said. “However, if it is to
make a real breakthrough it is essential
to export. I believe this can be done, but
it means a trade which is highly organised
and highly capitalised, and with first-class
representation in London and New
York.”
OVERSEAS
Wilson’s
Big
Gamble
Through EFT A to
Downing St
From NORA BELOFF
Mr Elarold Wilson’s apparently
extravagant bid to reunite Europe,
made at the Vienna meeting of
the European Free Trade Association
(EFTA), was inspired by two secret and
unmentionable assumptions. The British
Prime Minister is assuming, first, that
the political objective of the European
Economic'Community (EEC) to form
the nucleus of a United States of Europe
is doomed to failure. Secondly, after
his private visits to Bonn and Paris, Mr
Wilson believes that Franco-German in-
timacy is foundering, and that for differ-
ent, sometimes conflicting, reasons of
their own, both President de Gaulle and
Chancellor Erhard may soon be turning
towards Britain.
When the Prime Minister outlined his
ideas at the summit EFTA conference
for bringing EFTA partners into a free
trade arrangement with the EEC Six, it
might have seemed that Britain’s demo-
cratic rulers, like the old Bourbons, had
learned nothing and forgotten nothing.
The Six had always argued that they
would not admit other countries into
their lush, integrated market unless these
would accept a single tariff wall against
the outside world and collective measures
for creating full economic union. This
would involve the free movement of
capital and labor and ultimately a single
commercial policy and one currency,
designed eventually to form not only an
economic but a political super-State.
Faced with the all-or-nothing approach
from the Six, the British, under Mr
Harold Macmillan, had chosen the all,
and tried to become full members of
the Community with EFTA partners fol-
lowing after. President de Gaulle’s veto
in 1963 put an end to all that, and now
once again we are hearing the old theme
songs of the 1950 s on bridge-building
between the two blocs, and on the need
for reciprocal tariff reductions until the
divisions of Europe disappear.
Many of Wilson’s listeners were
frankly incredulous. As we toasted
EFTA’s future under the crystal chan-
deliers of the ceremonial hall of the
Hofburg Palace, 1 found myself being
asked by Continental statesmen whether
Wilson was making this European initia-
tive purely as a ploy in domestic politics.
Certainly, with his precarious majority,
he has an interest in seizing the European
torch from the Conservatives and the
new bid will appeal to many people in
Britain, from anxious traders fearing ex-
clusion from European markets, to young
cosmopolitans.
To militants of the Labor Party, the
Commonwealth is still more respectable
than Europe where the Six are sus-
pect as “a rich man’s club” and the
Commonwealth represents a progressive
inter-racial partnership between rich and
poor but most voters do not share
Labor’s non-conformist conscience. But
whatever the internal pressures, Wilson is
too good a tactician to risk an inter-
national initiative which would expose
him to ridicule and rebuff. If he believes
he can succeed today where his predeces-
sors failed it is not because he is a
dreamy utopian, but rather because he
sees himself functioning in a very differ-
ent but rapidly changing Europe.
Paradoxically, the man who slammed
the door on Britain last time is now mak-
ing this new initiative possible. President
de Gaulle has refused to allow the
Economic Community to advance, as its
sponsors originally intended, towards
federal union. The Common Market has
unquestionably succeeded in its economic
aims, but has been far from successful in
asserting supra-national authority over
national governments. This makes it
much easier for the seven of EFTA, in-
cluding the neutrals, to look forward to
forging links without accepting total
political commitment.
The Common Market aim was that

their European grouping would form an
effective partnership with the Americans
inside the Atlantic Alliance, in which the
neutrals could find no place. This is still
the objective of the leaders of the Com-
mon Market Commission and their poli-
tical vanguard, M. Jean Monnet’s Euro-
pean Action Committee. At a recent
meeting of the representatives of the
parties and trades unions which form the
committee, a resolution was passed re-
pudiating nationalism and urging that
the system of Common European insti-
tutions should now spread from economic
to political and military matters. Thus,
the Atlantic Alliance would rest on two
equal European and US pillars.
All this is anathema to President de
Gaulle, whose whole idea, spelt out in
no uncertain terms in his recent provin-
cial tour, is to rid Europe of US shackles.
The French President does not want to
kick over the Common Market, which
has yielded him good commercial and
financial dividends, but is quite prepared
to violate the supra-national clauses of
the Rome Treaty. Notably, he has al-
ready let it be known that France will
not agree, as laid down by the treaty, to
abide by a majority rule where he feels
national interests are involved. More
specifically, he is refusing to abandon
France’s right to negotiate its own trade
deals with the Communist countries. Un-
der the Rome Treaty commercial agree-
ments should be the exclusive prerogative
of the Brussels Commission. In this sense
the treaty is already breaking down.
The British Prime Minister, though he
deplores President de Gaulle’s anti-
Americanism, is far from sorry to watch
spanners being thrown into the Com-
munity’s supra-national wheels. It is
true that President de Gaulle might still
refuse renewed talks between the Six
and Seven, and so put paid to Wilson’s
much-trumpeted European initiative. But
should he do so, at a time when he is
also falling out with his Common Market
partners over the US issue and on the
implementation of the Treaty of Rome,
he could find himself very much alone.
If he goes one stage further and pulls
out of Nato, there would be renewed
pressure from the Five to bring Britain
into Europe to redress the balance.
But in his efforts to counteract the
powers of the Brussels supra-national
institutions, President de Gaulle may
well find that talks with EFTA, including
the neutrals, could be useful. There is
secret evidence that Dr Hallstein, head of
the Brussels Commission, is very worried
that this time, when it comes to the
crunch. President de Gaulle may enjoy
playing EFTA against Brussels. Mr Wil-
son thinks so, too. Meanwhile, the
British Prime Minister can also see in-
dications that the Germans might wel-
come Britain's bid for reconciling EFTA
and the Common Market. Chancellor
Erhard, unlike his predecessor, Chan-
cellor Adenauer, who was in power when
Britain’s Reginald Maudling failed, has
always believed in his own favorite
formula: “Six plus seven, equals one.”
There are both commercial and poli-
tical reasons why the Germans are be-
coming restive within the confines of the
Six. Commercially, it is inside the EFTA
market that Germany today is earning
its trade surplus, and this could be en-
dangered if there is an increasing tariff
differential between the two blocs. Poli-
tically, there is evidence of a revival of
German interest in reunification. The
“little Europeans” of Jean Monnet's
Action Committee responded to this at
their last meeting by publishing a reso-
lution urging that if Western Europe is
highly integrated and working in close
military partnership with the United
States, the Russians may allow East Ger-
mans to join West Germany inside the
Western Community, but many Germans
would agree with Wilson that this is
highly unlikely, and that a new European
pattern will be needed to make German
reunification a reality.
In Wilson’s mind neither the French
nor the Germans are wholly committed
either to the Community or to each
other. Get them around the table with
EFTA Ministers, as he has suggested,
and perhaps some new formula for agree-
ment, might be found. The moment has
come, he believes, to shake the European
kaleidoscope. But nobody, not even he,
would pretend to know what strange
pattern may emerge, (ofns)

“This Stab
in the Back”
Last week President Nasser of Egypt told a rally of Pales-
tinian Arabs that the time was not yet ripe for an attack on
Israel. “How can I attack Israel when / have 50,000 troops in
The Yemen?’’ he asked.
In written replies to questions put by The Bulletin the
United Arab Republic’s ambassador in Canberra, His Excel-
encv El Sayed Nabih Abdel-Hamid, fills in the background to
President Nasser’s policy on Israel and the West.
MR ABDEL-HAMID, some reports have suggested that
Israel may try a pre-emptive attack against the UAR
similar to the invasion of the Sinai Desert in 1956.
Do you share this view?
It would scarcely be surprising if Israel repeats its aggres-
sions against the UAR. Events in the past decade, especially
in 1956, amply prove its aggressiveness and expansionism.
Whatever may be, the Arab countries, especially the UAR, are
perfectly ready and competent to repel such aggressions. The
result of any rashness on Israel's side will be the return to
the Palestinian Arabs of their denied rights.
What are the prospects for peace in the Middle East?
It is impossible to establish an enduring peace if not based
on justice. If you are alluding to the
probability of an armed friction as a
result of the decisions of the Arab States
to secure their rightful share of the
Jordan River waters for the benefit of
their people, we wish to say that the
right of the Arab people to draw their
requirements from the Jordan River
waters which springs from their land
and flows in their land is incontestable.
The Arab people will not allow Israel
to pilfer these waters to implement its
aggressive and expansionist projects at
the expense of the Arab people.
What is the present state of relations
between UAR and Israel?
There is no change in UAR stand towards Israel. Israel
was founded on aggression and it is imperative that the situa-
tion should be mended for the establishment of permanent
peace in the Middle East based on justice which is of vital
importance to international peace.
How seriously do you regard West Germany’s decision to
establish full diplomatic relations with Israel?
West Germany has granted Israel enormous sums of
money reaching nine and a half billion dollars as reparations
for the Nazi persecution of the Jews. These reparations were
misappropriated by Israel as even the German Government
did not consider Israel as the rightful heir of Jews who suffered
at the hands of Nazism. The German authorities declared
that while they are convinced that Israel had no right to
those reparations they were forced into agreement under
Western pressure. The German authorities had repeatedly
given their assurances that they have never agreed to the
shipment of arms to Israel in compliance with their decision
not to send arms to sensitive areas. Yet lately we have
discovered the secret agreement between Ben Gurion and
Chancellor Adenauer, by which enormous quantities of arms
were dispatched to Israel as a gift. This took place while
“The unity of
the Arab
world is
an unshakable
fact ...”
MR ABDEL-HAMID
the Germans were continually denying the existence of sue?#
an agreement. The Arab-German relations were always
characterised by friendship and sympathy for their aspirations
for unification without foreign interference. We have received
the West German gratitude for this policy. Yet we received
this stab in the back from the West German Government
which fully realises that those arms will be used for aggression
against the Arab countries.
President Nasser has been very critical of West Germany
in recent speeches and has also attacked other Western States,
including Britain and the United States. Has the UAR reached
a point of no return in relations with the West?
The declared policy of the UAR is non-alignment founded
on complete faith in international peace based on justice and
international co-operation embracing all spheres for securing
international welfare. The sole issue that has an adverse
influence on the UAR relations with the Western World is
its inequitable support for Israel regardless of principles of
justice and in spite of the UN resolutions which confirmed
the rights of the Arab people of Palestine for repatriation
and compensations. We believe that once those countries
realise that it is impossible to impose an unjust peace, no
obstacles will exist in the) path of promoting the relations
between the UAR and the Western World on a sound basis
for the cause of international peace and security.
Why is the UAR involved in the Yemen War? Is this
involvement supported by other Arab States?
The Yemeni people chafed under the oppressive rule of
the Hamid-el-Dine family. They suffered from despicable
tyranny, serfdom and backwardness which the Western writers
described as similar to the dark ages of
the ninth and tenth centuries. It was not
strange in any way for the UAR to
hasten to the aid of the Yemeni people
in their revolt and to help them further
in suppressing the counter-revolutionary
and feudal elements lurking on their
country’s borders. The UAR will con-
tinue to help the Yemeni Government
as long as this free Arab nation
desires it. As for the support of the
other Arab countries .we will do well
to refer you to the decisions of the
summit meetings of the Arab kings and
the heads of States in 1964.
The American journal, “The New Leader”, has described
President Nasser as “surely the most brilliant leader to emerge
in the Levant in modern times”. Do you agree that liberal
opinion sympathetic to President Nasser in the West finds it
difficult to reconcile sympathy with reported totalitarian sup-
pression of dissent?
The Arab people are by now used to bear the prejudicial
slander of some circles, opposed to their progress and freedom,
accusing President Nasser of suppressing and persecuting
opposing political elements and establishing a sort of dictator-
ship. It is enough in this respect to refer to Presidential
election which took place last March and which was 99.9 per
cent in favor of President Nasser. The editor of The
Bulletin would be welcomed to visit the UAR and see for
himself the extent of the efforts to establish a true democratic
life as well as the extent of people's unanimous devotion and
support to their President. President Nasser has become a
symbol for dignity, pride, independence, progress and libera-
tion, not only for the UAR, but also for every national move-
ment having as its cause the liberation from all foreign
influence and endeavors to achieve internal welfare and
progress.

Does the future of the Arab world
lie in a united bloc of nations led by
the UAR or will there be individual
development?
The monumental achievements of the
people of the UAR in the political,
economical and social sphere since 1952,
are in themselves the irrefutable proof
of the accomplishment of the 1952 revo-
lution. The Unity of the Arab World is
an unshakable fact in spite of the arti-
ficial political frontiers that imperialism
imposed on the Arab people. The Arab
people are united by historical, linguistic,
cultural and religious ties. They also
share in ™“" destin y- The moment is
not opportune to illustrate the eventual
achievement of the Arab poUtical Unity .
This is the sole concern of the Arab
nation. Yet this unity will be realized
by their free will and choice and in spite
of any obstacles as the fate of the Arab
World depends on it.
Not Only
Dominica
A continent for revolution
From J. HALCRO FERGUSON
THhe Dominican crisis is only the major
symptom —the most obviously dram-
atic —of a conflict of forces which is
going on in many of the countries of
Latin America.
United States intervention has meant
that world attention has been turned on
the Dominican Republic. US emphasis
on Communist influence has tended to
take the crisis out of its domestic context,
but the conflict would exist even if the
US kept aloof and the Communists re-
mained quiescent.
Basically, it is a struggle between two
ways of life, two concepts of society,
which began with the Mexican Revolu-
tion of 1910 and has continued ever
since, with increasing momentum since
the end of the Second World War. The
seeds of strife were sown a century and
a half ago, at the very moment when the
Spanish - speaking Latin Americans
achieved their independence from the
mother country and Portuguese - speaking
Brazil declared herself an empire. In
a sense, Latin Americans achieved their
independence too soon.
In the early nineteenth century this
was not understood by the Latin-
American liberators. Sovereignty was
enough. Grand words about liberty and
equality were borrowed from the French
and American Revolutions, but power
remained in the hands of a small Spanish-
descended minority.
While Latin America floundered
throughout the nineteenth century, the
Europe from which most of her culture
stemmed went through an industrial revo-
lution. Latin America notably Mexico,
Brazil, Argentina and Venezuela—caught
up with this only in the mid-twentieth
century. This, combined with the ideals
propounded by the propaganda for free-
dom with which the US bombarded Latin
America in the Second World War and
the example of the Mexican Revolution,
caused a belated stirring of resentment in
the so-called Latin countries.
This produced various results in vari-
ous countries. In Argentina, in 1945,
it produced the dictatorship of Peron—■
a curious compromise between the old
nationalist concept of sovereignty and
the new class-consciousness of the trade
unions. In Bolivia it produced the
revolution of 1952, in which a combina-
tion of tin-miners and intellectuals over-
threw an Army-backed (and unconstitu-
tional) regime. In Cuba, in 1959, it

produced a revolution which eventually
made Cuba part of the Communist bloc
—or, as the Cubans would say, one of
the Socialist nations.
In Brazil, the largest country in Latin
America, it gave rise almost prematurely
to the dictatorship of Getulio Vargas,
which started in 1930 and lasted for 15
years—like Peron’s it was authoritarian,
but based its power on the little man
and, above all, the trade unionist. In
Venezuela the new wave overthrew a
dictatorship, in 1958, and a series of
Social Democratic Governments have
held power ever since, backed by the
US and bitterly opposed by Communist
Cuba.
In Colombia, where unadventurous
Liberal Governments (the other major
party is the Conservative) had held
power for nearly half a century, the
assassination in 1948 of a dissident
Liberal leader, Jorge Gaitan, gave rise
to the so-called Bogotazo, when the
centre of the national capital, Bogota,
was torn to pieces by an infuriated mob.
In Brazil an elected but erratic and
Left-wing Government was thrown out
last year with dubious legality and Army
support. In Bolivia, also last year, the
1952 revolution was partly reversed by
a coup by Vice-President General Bar-
rientos, who is now facing a general
strike and possible civil war at the hands
of the tin-miners and other Leftists. .
But some countries are calmer. In
earthquake-torn Chile, a left-of-centre
Christian Democrat op-
posed by a moderate Left-wing Socialist
opposition, is firmly in control. In demo-
cratic, dull and admirable Uruguay,
which virtually functions under a perm-
anent coalition, improbable reports of a
possible Army coup have been traced
to angry smears by a Brazilian news-
paper.
The disparity between the Latin
American nations, making nonsense of
the concept of a Latin American bloc, is,
in fact, shown by their reaction to US
intervention in the Dominican Republic.
Mexico, not surprisingly, was the first to
criticise. But the next two countries to
do so were Christian Democrat Chile and
anti-Cuban and Pro-US Venezuela.
Brazil, or rather Brazil’s present Govern-
ment, backed up the US, as did most of
the small Central American countries
which are economically dependent on the
US.
Argentina, after a highly adult and
unimpassioned debate in Congress, came
to no very clear conclusion at all. And
thus, without meaning to, probably sum-
med up a consensus of informed Latin
American opinion. Most Latin Americans
certainly oppose US policy privately, but
many are afraid of saying so openly—•
for domestic as well as international
reasons, (ofns)

SIR. Whether or not the Tass or the

the present MVD agent (National Note-
book, 8., June 5) is of less importance for
journalists than that (1) both are pri-
marily State officials, who (2) attend no
Press conference and no formal or in-
formal party and make no sort of offi-
cial or personal contact without prior
clearance from the present MVD agent,
whoever he might be; without his precise
directive on the course to be followed,
and without afterwards reporting in
detail to this superior. I offer no criti-
cism, and join in from no ideological
motive. My one concern is that the elapse
of 11 years does not deprive younger col-
leagues of the lesson of the Petrov Com-
mission. For me that Commission showed
I had incurred the dislike of both ex-
treme Left and extreme Right. The
mouthpiece of the latter was at as much
pains as any commissar could have been
to clothe with some veracity paltry defa-
mations in the MVD documentation,
and my repudiation visibly irritated him;
but personal feelings have nothing to
do with the professional lesson which
is down there in black and white.
I felt sorry for the dingy living con-
ditions and apparent friendlessness of
three Tass “correspondents” in Sydney
(doubtless things are better in Canberra).
How the last of them, one Antonov, was
repaying my sympathy and hospitality
while accepting it gets beyond the per-
sonal plane. I am still sorry for the poor,
badgered fellow; but my experience is a
warning to political journalists of an oc-
cupational hazard. The Bulletin ac-
count suggests both that current gallery-
men have the situation sized up and that
the MVD man who countermanded the
conference stunt has paid them the com-
pliment of recognising it.

State Aid
SIR. The Bulletin's article, “The
Making of a Premier” (8., June 5), makes
one good point when its states that “We
will never know precisely WHY the elec-
torate decided to evict the Labor Party.”
However, it then gives a rather lengthy
discourse on the vexed question of direct
“State Aid”. This discourse should strike
many members of the NSW Staie Coun-
cil of the Liberal Party as being rather
biased and calculated to leave the im-
pression that the Liberal Party won the
election because it promised direct “State
Aid” and not in spite of such a promise.
Both alternatives are possible. The article
also gives the impression that direct
“State Aid” was promised as a smart

from the Self-Employed Persons Retirement Fund
recommended by the Bank of New South Waiesf
Most self-employed people have to make
special provision for retirement. The prob-
lem is “How best to do it?”
The Self-Employed Persons Retirement
Fund offers you a good business proposi-
tion.
Here’s why—
Taxation concessions.
• Contributions may be deducted from
your personal income (up to the limit
of £4OO p.a. for superannuation and life
assurance payments).
• Income earned by your contributions is
tax-free and fully re-invested.
• Benefit which is paid as a lump sum is
not taxable. (Maximum benefit per-
mitted, now £40,000.)
Ifou can vary your contributions. You
don’t have to commit yourself to fixed con-
tributions. You may pay in any amount
at any time ... up to £4OO a year to the
age of 40; £BOO a year between the ages of
40 and 55; and £1,200 a year from age 55
to retirement.
Full benefit on retirement After deduc-
tion of low management fees, your contri-
butions are invested and you receive the
full benefits.
Security. Your contributions to the Fund
are expertly invested, under Bank of New
South Wales supervision, in a wide range
of sound securities authorized by the Trust
Deed.
No age limit for membership. The Fund
is open to everyone whose principal source
of income is any profession or business
carried on by him alone or as a partner.

trick or expedient and not as a matter of
principle. The pros and cons of “State
Aid” have been canvassed in the restricted
circulation of “The Australian Liberal”.
But the only recent occasion on which
the rank and file of the Party have had
an opportunity of discussing this matter
at a forum open to the Press was at the
last Convention of the Party in NSW in
November, 1962. Despite the fact that
the ALP, DLP and Country Party have
held annual conferences open to the
Press during the past three years there
has been no Liberal Convention. One
Convention arranged for November,
1964, was vetoed by the Party’s Execu-
tive with the aid of a docile or “steam-
rollered” State Council. This may be
good politics, but it is bad democracy.
As only about six per cent of the elec-
tors belong to political parties, open dis-
cussion should be a must.

Film Exhibitors
SIR. —In his letter “Film Cutters” (8.,
May 22), I. J. Hutchinson accuses
exhibitors of “mutilating” films. If any
exhibitors are cutting films, they are
doing so in breach of their film hiring
agreements with the distributors of the
films. All film hiring contracts contain
a clause requiring the exhibitor to screen
the film in its entirety, and I doubt
whether this clause is ever broken. If,
therefore, a film is shown in Australia in
a shorter version than that shown over-
seas, the cutting must either have taken
place overseas or in the office of the film
distributor here. There are of course
instances where exhibitors would like to
see films cut, as there are numerous
occasions on which patrons express the
view that such-and-such a film could
have been greatly improved by having
20 or 30 minutes cut out of it. Whether
the films referred to by I. J. Hutchinson
fall into that category, I do not know.
I do know, however, that exhibitors find
it impossible to please “all the people all
the time”.

started the season with steel
(At St. Kilda’s new football ground the trend is to steel — 22,925 square feet of it!)
And when the fans stand up to cheer the winning
kick, they won’t spare a thought for all that steel.
But one thing is certain —steel will keep them full of
cheer—hail, rain or shine. Year after year. This new
6,000 capacity grandstand at Moorabbin (Mel-
bourne’s first new league ground, and built for St.
Kilda club) features 22,925 square feet of steel sheet.
To be exact: 18,950 square feet of Klip-Lok roofing
with spans up to 58 feet; and 3,975 square feet of
Tri-Lok walling. So look around. The trend is to
steel. For homes. For commercial buildings. Indus-
trial projects. And football grounds, too. Steel,
because of its great structural strength. Steel, because
it looks good in its natural state. Steel, because in
the long run it costs less. Lysaght roofing and walling
comes in six attractive profiles. Klip-Lok, Spandek,

Getting civilised in Golconda
By M. H. ELLIS
We were in Golconda —Mt Morgan.
The Ellis family had joggled
into the largest town its younger
members could remember seeing, its
houses perched on stilts on a series of
hills over which fell the shadow of a
mountain in which a huge pink gash had
been cut. Round the gash ran little
electric locomotives and, as dusk fell,
out came a large quantity of electric
lights, the first we had ever seen.
Chimneys, some tall and slender, some
squat and square, poked upwards from
the slopes of the mountain, belching
glowing smoke. And the air was filled
wfith a steady hum, punctuated with a
pulsing sound like a great heart-beat
which could be heard day and night far
out into the ranges. When you left the
place years afterwards, you felt for a
little, as you missed these sounds, as if
something were wrong, and as if your
own heart had stopped beating.
Every house had a round corrugated
iron thousand-gallon tank. Every yard
was full of fowls rooting under the
quick-growing. pepperina trees. On the
flats, a splash of isolated green along the
riverbank, lay the opulent spread of the
Chinamen’s garden, its old, .blind-folded
horse walking round and round on a
circular path as it hauled water. The
streets of the suburbs were so rugged
that all tradesmen went on horseback
butcher, baker and postman alike.
My father was soon at the Electric
Light Works doing something he had not
done for years • clerical work. We
were in a home with real walls for the
first time for many years. We were
almost regularly—dry. We were getting
civilised. We were part of what seemed
a teeming community. There were chur-
ches, chapels and Sunday schools *o
which people in bonnet and shawl, : n
once-black coats inherited from British
“granfers”, but turned green with age,
and flat-topped black hats, might be seen
making their wary ways to chapel amid
the rocks of a sabbath. These persons
were accompanied by impious mobs of
sailor-hatted and pinafored youth, all
more intent on sneaking down to the
verges of the Big Dam for dabbling or
dalliance than on the mysteries of reli-
gion and the goodness of the Creator.
I think my most vividly remembered
impressions of Golconda were of the
opulence and abundance of new kinds of
delicious food, so different from the
“fresh or corned” monotony of bush
dinner-tables. No more johnny cake, no
more wallaby stew, no more pig-weed,
yams or billabong mussels, or tinned
potatoes. This was a world in which one
ate bakers’ bread, “pudden in shirt-tail”
made with kidney and beef (or goat if
times were hard), mushrooms culled
round the Big Dam, Golden Syrup in

sons of the Mount round about the year
of Federation.
7T"he reason for the Ellis family being in
A Mt Morgan was a yearning for culture.
My mother had decided that it was
time her family learned to live in a home
with floors and went to a real school.
Acquiring a home in Golconda was easy.
First, you took out a miner’s right. That
entitled you to land. You looked round
the bald, granite hills from which all the
timber had been cut down for firewood.
You applied for a miner's homestead
lease one acre. You persuaded the
local auctioneer to lend you £25 for
galvanised iron and timber, and from
then onwards progress was easy. First
you put up a square box on stumps
capped with zinc to keep the white ants
out of the building, providing shelter un-
derneath for the goats and fowls; next
came a thousand-gallon tank and some
bag partitions and a stove to replace the
original camp ovens. If you lived on a
fine, open ironstone hill like the one on
which we built our palace, you could
depend on most of the new home dis-
appearing every time the thunderstorm
season came along. Then you collected
the insurance (if any), paid the auction-
eer and re-borrowed from him to start
afresh.
Mt Morgan in 1899-1900 was a happy
place; for years at a time the town had
had work for nearly everybody. Mostly
the work was with pick and shovel in
hot narrow tunnels, which no modern
medical officer would pass, or in the
blinding dust of the mills or the gases

of the chlorination or cyanide recovery
works; or on some outside erection in
a cloud of red, acid-impregnated tailings.
There were no holidays, save one or two
in the year. The picks never stopped,
the mills never ceased grinding, the
chimneys never stopped smoking, so
that the glow from them could be seen
miles away. The bush-dweller far out
in the ranges heard three times in every
24 hours the weird bellow of the hooters
telling the men to come off or on shift.
They came “off” on foot, visible in
long lines, climbing out of the tunnels
in their “labor” hats, their dusty blue
army-flannel shirts and bowyanged dun-
garees. They walked with the curious
bandy walk of the bowyang-wearer. As
the “off-shifters” came down, dirty and
weary, the new shifts in other long lines
climbed upwards, wicker crib bag in
left hand, struggling upward in their
bluchers at call of hooter and looking
back enviously at the downgoers who
would soon be sitting in a sedate row
in front of the Shamrock Hotel while
the “cutters ran” from mouth to mouth
along the thirsty line three quarts of
good beer in a billycan for a shilling.
The rims of the billies were politely
wiped with a dirty sleeve between mouth
and mouth. The billies were collected
for replenishment by the little boys who
got a “halfpenny a run” for their ser-
vices. Many a halfpenny have I earned
on my way home from school on this
errand of mercy.
Most of the mine workers and a very
great proportion of their children had
been born in Northumbria or Scottish
or Welsh or Cornish mining towns, with
a leaven who had been in South Africa
or California, man, woman and boy and
girl. This gave the place an effervescing,
cosmopolitan air of movement and im-
permanence. Its inhabitants brought
their manners and customs with them.
The nodding plumes at funerals, the
little dissenting churches and chapels,
the close confinement of movement to
narrow geographical limits were all
characteristic of the British mining
towns and villages, as were the amuse-
ments and the culture.
One of the greatest changes I noticed
when I went back there as a guest of the
mine directors just on sixty years after
my first arrival, was the change in habits
to Australianism, though the fine, self-
generated music and entertainment per-
sisted. The visit to the gold-carrying
creek with pan and cradle had been re-
placed with a visit to the fine town
public golf course. Everybody seems to
have forgotten how to “wash dirt”. The
miners no longer made for the gutter in
front of the Shamrock but for the Com-
pany swimming pools or the saloon bars,
not tramping down in their bowyangs,
which few would have recognised for

In Mt Morgan today, the week-end
picnic at the Big Darn or Long Water
Hole is replaced by the drive into Rock-
hampton on a tarred road for shopping
or the “latest picture” or show. No more
do the proletariat limit fhemselves to one
sight of the sea a year, gained as the
crowded trains shake them to rags in the
course of the annuaCschool picnic to
Emu Park. And there is apparently not
a goat nor bit of firewood in the place
unless you buy it. and there are no
Chinese gardens.
It was somewhat fortunate for us that
we arrived in Mt Morgan in October
1 899. for on October 11 the South Afri-
can War broke out and there was soon
a scramble to enlist, which left plenty of
work open for newcomers for the time
being.
I have good cause to remember the
day on which the news of the outbreak
arrived, for that was the day that I first
went to a real school. And it was indeed
a day to remember. I am sure that the
British at . Nicholson’s Nek were not
more surprised than I was at the ex-
perience. My mother, intent on having
her offspring do credit to their station,
had fitted me out in a yellow and white
galatea sailor blouse, a pair of very tight
boots, a turned-up straw sailor hat and
a nice sandwich lunch. And my father
had given me a fine bag of marbles so
as to enable me to compete with young
Mt Morgan in what seemed to be the
national game.
On the way to the school to join its
400 other victims I met a polite young
Scottish gentleman w'ho volunteered to
teach me the local game. It was only
after he had won all my “agates” and
“commons” and “glassies” that he made
me aw'are that we were playing “for
keens”. He gave me a nasty black eye
for discount. Arrived at school, a large
and rude audience inspected my straw hat
they were all wearing ninepenny
“rags” until a large person took it into
a secret place and used it for a most in-
sanitary purpose. Then somebody re-
marked: “Look at his hooves!” And they
apparently made some desperate resolu-
tions about disposal of my “footwear”
which were never put into operation be-
cause to my only temporary relief —-
the second bell rang and we were all
lined up for “hand inspection” which
was performed by the head teacher who
had been a sergeant major in the British
Army and looked it. His mode of com-
ment was to slash an offending hand with
a large cane.
We were marched into school and my
new class was sat down at its desks.
Immediately the Headmaster entered
with cane he was rarely seen without
it. He conferred briefly with the class
master who shouted: “Stand up, the
Boy Black!’’ Nobody was ever referred
to by name, save with the prefix “boy”
attached. The Boy Black, looking a little
pale, stood up. “Come here!” The Boy
Black “came here”. “Turn round”. He
turned round. “Put your hands behind
your back, palms together.” The Boy
Black did, very slowly. They were seized
in the head teacher’s left hand and pulled
up between his shoulder blades. “Now,”
said the Head Teacher, evenly. “You
were playing the wag yesterday, weren’t
you? You were swimming yesterday,
weren’t you?” And then the blows began
to fall.
The Cane
’T’his was my introduction to formal
education and a new experience for
me. I was horrified. I never got used to
the cane. In the bush we were taught not
even to beat animals, though we shot
wild ones remorselessly and the strap
was for use in private But to see boys
having their hands thwacked in public
or their sterns caned seemed an outrage
from which I shrank, dreading the day
when I would attract the wrath of the
teacher, though I was not a coward.
When the God-in-the-machine did hit
me it was the end. It happened one
morning when he caned a whole class
for failing to complete a map of Ireland
by marking in the city of Cork. It was
everybody’s misfortune that I had a
fractured ulna just out of splints. A
current went up my arm, everything went
red and I found myself running up the
street with my right fist involuntarily
clenched tight. He had not hit me
savagely or even more than cursorily.
But it is a strange fact that even sixty
years later, if I suffer more than usual
mental stress, I have to reach under the
table and unclench that right hand. After
that I never went back to that school.
The adventure of young Black had
not completed my first day there. After
school, the lads of the village had taken
my nice new shoes and stockings and
thrown them into the creek. They had
eaten my sandwiches. They had per-
suaded me to take a penny to buy carrots
from the Chinese garden down near the
bridge and then they had seized the
Chinaman’s water melons just as he was
serving me. As they left for the river
crossing, they had shouted: “Come on,
he’s got a knife!” and left me in the
possession of an outraged Cantonese
who believed me to be their decoy.
However, he was a man with a sense
of humor and after he had thought it
over, he laughed and laughed and
laughed. I then went home minus mar-
bles, shoes, socks and plus a black eye.
I was not very well received by a mother
who had pinched and sewn by fat lamp

treated him to a little Kamilroi tech-
nique, taking him firmly by both ears,
then falling over backward and finally
trying to use the horny soles of two
agile feet to batter his Hibernian coun-
tenance flat. His several friends had some
difficulty in removing me from him
without also removing his lugs,
It was shortly after this that I was
caned and retired and it is symptomatic
of the age and outlook that nobody at
home seemed greatly concerned about
the incidental factor that attendance at
the only other available school at Red
Hill meant an eight-mile daily walk
four miles there, four miles back not
only for myself but for a brother eighteen
months younger and rising nine. Since
we no longer wore boots this didn’t con-
cern us much either. Anyway, we were
men of leisure.
There was nothing to do between
dawn when we rose and 7.45 a.m. when
we set out for school except take a
couple of kerosene cans in chaff bags
slung across a pony to a well about a
mile away, haul water out of the well
with a windlass, bring it home, help milk
a few goats and fill the space under the
belt with stiff, coarse oatmeal, brown
sugar and goat’s milk the diet that
made real men of human chickens.
I calculate that I walked some thous-
ands of miles on bare soles to and from
that school, through allegedly poisonous
granite outcrops and street dust, over
splintery railway sleepers, through
chemicalised tailings and various bits of
hard ground which, plus goat yards and
fowl yards, should have been infected
with every disease known to man.
This second school I went to was the
antithesis of the first. It was co-educa-
tional. The headmaster, Daniel Baldwin,
was pale, kind and consumptive. He
rarely used the cane. He was a photo-
grapher and every year produced a
separate Christmas card for each of a
hundred senior pupils—“ Water Train at
the Railway Bridge”, “View from Shep-
herd's Gully”. Though his boys came
from the same classes as in the more cen-
tral school, they seemed to have none of
the predilections evident in the other to-
wards playing the wag or slugging China-
men. His one social problem was Young
Love which, in that tropic climate, was
inclined to get a little out of hand some-
times. His cure for this malady was to
take any too-obviously-loving pair and
seat them together on the high main steps
of the school to do their lessons together
in full sight of the whole populace. This
antidote in its effects somewhat resembled
the old New England remedy of exposing
the over-amorous side-by-side under the
public gallows with halters round their
necks.
He had the faculty of getting work out
of the willing, so that he forced me into
second place in the State bursary examin-
ations, and of egging on the timid to
public displays, as proved by the fact
that he persuaded me to stand up at a
school concert and recite a stirring poem
called “True Courage”, the details of
which I have not the slightest recollec-
tion.
But it needs to be added that school
with the stick and school without it
both produced citizens who filled, as
some still fill, high positions in Austra-
lian life.

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
In the Teeth
of Television
JUDITH TURNER as CIO CIO SAN in the Eliza-
bethan company of "MADAME BUTTERFLY" which
recently toured New South Wales and Queens-
land for the Arts Council.
By PATRICIA ROLFE
Four members of the Sydney players,
the Q Group, have just begun the
longest tour, both in time and dis-
tance, undertaken for the NSW Arts
Council. Some Sydney actors can look
intrepid anywhere beyond five miles of
the GPO, but the Q Group are gamely
going as far afield as New Guinea. Dur-
ing the NSW tour, which will take them
into July, they are playing in the teeth
of drought and new television stations.
The Q Group has taken three of its
past successes, “The Dock Brief,”
JANICE COPLAND, EDWARD HEPPLE and WALTER SULLIVAN in "THE SPONGE ROOM"
one of the three one-act plays which the Q Group has taken on tour for the Arts Council.
Chekhov’s “The Proposal” and “The
Sponge Room.” The players are Janice
Copland and three original members of
the 18 months’ old group, Ben Gabriel,
Edward Hepple and Walter Sullivan.
On the first leg of the tour, through
the Hunter Valley and New England, the
actors were about a month after tele-
vision. “Garages weren't even selling
petrol,” Walter Sullivan said, “so you
can imagine how much money was being
flung around.”
However, as the Arts Council has
previously learnt, television does not cast
a universal blight. It shrivels attendances
in some areas, but not in others; it les-
sens interest in some entertainments but
not in others. And. of course, its effect
is transitory. It is just one more factor
which the Arts Council has to take into
account in planning ahead and one more
factor which makes its job seem tedious
and unrewarding and its achievement
small.
This year has been the most active in
the history of the NSW Arts Council.
The Q Group follows the Elizabethan's
“Madame Butterfly,” the Australian
Theatre for Young People's “Hullabaloo
Belay” and Peter O’Shaughnessy’s one-
man show, “The Diary of a Madman.”
They have also had their usual presen-
tation of the Young Elizabethans and
presentations by the Australian Theatre
for Young People for city and country
schools.
All this has been undertaken with the
£15.500 grant from the State Govern-
ment. and, perhaps, in expectation of
getting a slice of the £lOO,OOO-odd which
the new Liberal Government plans to
divert from Opera Lottery profits each
year for eLiltural activities. The council
also gets some help from Esso, and a
few years ago received a far-flung hand-
out from the Gulbenkian Foundation.
This year’s ambitious programme is
also somewhat in expectation of what its
newly reformed Federal body can
achieve. A former Ambassador to Wash-
ington and Cabinet Minister. Sir Howard
Beale, is the new president of the Federal
body. While Sir Howard’s direct ex-
perience in the arts is negligible, he
may know the combination to unlock the
Federal Treasury. The NSW Arts Coun-
cil has links with Queensland. Scu;h
Australia and Western Australia.
In spite of so much valiant, painstak-
ing effort the Arts Council seems to win
nothing except criticism. Even people
from the Elizabethan Theatre Trust stop
licking their wounds long enough to
criticise the Arts Council.
The basic problem of the Arts Coun-
cil is Australia’s not enough popula-
tion and that spread over a large area.
The Arts Council generally plays a large
number of one-night stands, particularly
in NSW. This is tiring for players and
lifts transport costs. The ready answer
would be to develop a circuit of large
towns (particularly those with new
theatres) and play a season of several
nights at these, so that audiences get a
chance to build.
However, this solution only raises the
question of the Arts Council’s other
great problem shortage of money.
The Council relies on. the support of its
committees in each town. Some of the
smaller towns have very active commit-


tees, which would atrophy if their towns
were by-passed or saw only the smaller
and less interesting programmes.
And, according to the executive direc-
tor of the Arts Council, Mr Gordon
Horswell, playing even a two-night stand
instead of one often means incurring two
nights’ expenses for the same return.
In the meantime, the Arts Council
relies on their committees in the smaller
towns, although the financing system
seems unsatisfactory. Each local commit-
tee must raise a guaranteed sum for each
visit by a touring company. However, if
the local committee is very enthusiastic
and the proceeds of the performances
are above the guarantee, then the surplus
goes back to the Arts Council in Sydney.
Where, then, is the incentive?
Mr Horswell said that the Council
hopes eventually to abandon the subsidy
system in favor of a more simple method
of financing whereby the Arts Council
would pay the cost of transport and for
the Council’s permanent staff (which in-
cludes a manager on each tour), and the
local committees would pay production
costs and artists’ salaries, the sum struck
for each town being related to the town’s
size and, of course, the length of the
run.
In Queensland, with its large towns
running up the coast, the Arts Council
can get much closer to its ideal touring
arrangement. “Madame Butterfly” made
a profit of over £lOOO in two weeks in
Queensland while a six-weeks tour in
New South Wales lost £7OO. In New
South Wales it would be hard to say
when a change could come. The new
Canberra Theatre Centre talks hopefully
of winning audiences from as far
afield as Albury and Wagga, both of
which have themselves built major
theatres in the past few years.
The capriciousness of country audien-
ces has some reasonable basis. Whoever
follows a poor production invariably gets
bad houses. Country people are not al-
ways impressed with a reputation made
elsewhere. For instance, Sophie Stewart,
the leading lady in “Hay Fever,” did not
make the impact which her West End
and Broadway background might have
warranted. The country is more likely
to remember Ben Gabriel's long tours
with “The Doll,” “The One Day of the
Year” and “The Shifting Heart,” or the
frequent appearances of Gabriel, Sulli-
van and Hepple in radio and television,
or Miss Copland’s recent television
“Cinderella.”
Country people, too, raised in the
tradition of mail-order catalogues, are
wary that the production mightn’t be
what they ordered. “Hullabaloo Belay”
was “bought” on the Sydney production,
which had people like Gordon Glen-
wright, Neva Carr-Glyn and Marion
Johns in it, and then went to the country
with a completely different cast.
The Arts Council is obviously doing
a job which no commercial manage-
ment would these days take on. “If there
were money in it, would J. C. William-
son’s have left the field?” Mr Horswell
asked.
It is also a job which they could
expand effectively, and logically with
more money. It seems a pity that
people on the fringes of the council,
instead of hammering ceaselessly for
more money, seem to regard the subsidy
as a pension, and have the poor old
pensioner’s mentality—that if they work
•hard and do better, it might be taken
away from them.
How the West Was Won
By EYE AKERMAN
There are just a few hours left of
what have been, one way or an-
other, seven days of solid music.
Either from the WA Symphony Or-
chestra playing twice daily on a tour
of the Eastern Goldfields, or from the
train wheels below carrying us through
wheat country, farming lands, and the
countless miles of nothingness in
between.
Except that nothing is really nothing-
ness; the low scrub bordering the track
is orange tinged' as though bathed by
an evening sun, instead of by past bush
fires. Red earth tracks led heaven
knows where. The sky has at times rained
screaming white cockatoos and rose-
touched grey galahs. And two nomadic
emus seemed no more incredible than
the fantastic, light-years-from-anywhere
homes, built from dozens of tin slabs
jig-sawed into roofs, walls and barri-
cades. Against what?
To purely nominal townships (at most,
comprised of two or three stores, a pub,
and a hall), audiences have come 50 and
60 miles to hear Thomas Mayer. They
are the same people who would travel a
hundred miles and more for a rodeo.
Towns that have been completely
deserted when the train sidled in in mid-
morning, remained so until half an hour
before the 2 p.m. school concert, and
were, suddenly, amazingly alive with bus-
loads of children . . . black, white, and
brindle; bare-footed or in band-box best.
Night audiences of uniformly well-
dressed men, and women in their fur
pieces, and hair-dos faithfully followed
from magazines.
And all have returned to their homes
caching a memory which urbanites may
never share . . . two hours of superb
music and unprecedented showmanship
from Thomas Mayer and his team of 50.
Symphonies and song have carried them,
albeit temporarily, away from thoughts
of rain for the harvest, or wire for the
fencing.
This is Mayer’s first Australian tour.
He is fresh from Cincinatti, where he
was Associate Professor of Music and
Director of Musical Organisations at the
University of the city’s College Con-
servatory.
Audiences are eating out of his hand
from the first lift of his baton . . . after
his first spoken word, they’re his forever.
Tour programmes, I understand, were
arranged in Sydney. How wrong to flatly
state, “Haydn is suitable for school
concerts”! Many isolated, sparsely popu-
lated towns seem to have only low age-
group children, understandably bemused
and far less alert than their contempor-
aries from larger, more active centres.
In one hall I sat with two nuns from
the local convent . . . there in its entirety,
all 30 pupils, as part of an audience
gauged to be most primitive on the
itinerary. Not quite sub-thyroid, but
certainly resting their small reflexes.
Sixteen children missed that concert:
fruit of Plymouth Brethren forbidden
to attend public gatherings.
Reception from the same town’s adult
attendance, oddly enough, ran highest
in spontaneity and enthusiasm.
Bizet’s “Carmen” couldn’t have been
bettered as choice for the school con-
cert’s kick-off. An introduction to the
orchestra is, as always, a great success.
Mayer had each player hold up his
instrument and play a few bars before
asking the listeners to name it. “What
is it? A bise? Oh, yes, a bise. But we
odd musical people call it a bass.” “What
is the difference between a violin and
a ’cello?” Small boy: “A conductor.”
It’s been a wonderful week; com-
pletely uninhibited by the sanctimony
which goes hand in hand with city per-
formances.
How could it have been otherwise
with such diversions as a triumphant pipe
band marching up Main Street when the
atmosphere within was at its most
pianissimo ... or a child tooting non-
stop on a horn ... or a burly drunk
vociferously eager to snatch up the
lovely soprano, Margot Robertson?
And under what other circumstances
could we have heard Mayer say of a
long-gowned infant hot-footing up the
aisle on all fours: “If this little visitor
decides to accompany the symphony, he
who has been on earth such a short time
and is so much closer to infinity than we
... let us accept it as Mozart would
have. With love.”

THEATRE
Rough Ridge
Bandicoot on a Burnt Ridge. Marien
Dreyer. Russell Street Theatre. Mel-
bourne.
An Australian play! What could be more
pleasurable than being able to greet it
with unpretended joy? But unless.we are
willing to apply special standards to
Australian works which would be dis-
astrous it is impossible to be joyful
about “Bandicoot on a Burnt Ridge”.
So far from marking progress it rep-
resents a step backward. It has some
of the bounce of “The Doll”, but little
of its remaining qualities. The only other
piece one could compare it to without
disadvantage to itself would be “Rusty
Bugles”. Even then it does not really
score.
Marien Dreyer must have planned to
write a low-life drama which would tell
us something about a certain type of
Australian, the kind who masks his inner
emptiness, reflecting the boredom of his
garish environment, with false heartiness,
and who becomes tragic when the mask
breaks. On an incomparably higher plane
Patrick White has tried to do a similar
thing. The task is always difficult be-
cause it requires, if not genius, at least
great skill to make hollowness resonant.
This author’s alternative is lumpen-
proletarian realism in the established
manner of the Sydney school, which
began strongly with Louis Stone’s
“Jonah” 55 years ago and has not radi-
cally moved beyond it since. Is it not
revealing that, with a continent to play
with, so many novelists and dramatists
are to this day fascinated by the pos-
sibilities between Redfern and Darling-
hurst Road? But to be fair, even other
people's adaptations of Ruth Park’s ’Loo
sagas knock spots off this latest example
of a tradition that is growing into a
formula.
Two people, the housepainter Les
Baxter and his wife, Gladys, are im-
mured in a dowdy flat amid the din of
Kings Cross. Their mental life, vicari-
ously fed by the TV set, receives a
sudden stimulus from across the road,
where a drawn blind across a per-
manently-lit window hides the presence
of a psychopathic killer. The antics of
a roomful of “prossies” provide them
and us with additional entertainment. We
may guess that, as the story builds up,
the light behind the blind is meant to
take on a deeper significance.
The Baxters—she a dull slattern who
cannot have children because of an
alleged motor accident, he a slightly less
dull nohoper full of wild but typical
prejudices—begin to see themselves in-
volved in the drama opposite, trusting

that it will shed a little indirect glory
on them as well. They drink and they
watch; and eventually, when an arrest
is made while they have been sleeping,
they quarrel, having vainly spent money
on ingratiating themselves with the
Peeping-Tom reporters.
Outlined like this, it is not too out-
landish, but as theatre it comes to
nothing. Act One promises a comedy,
Act Two a thriller. Act Three, with most
of the action squeezed into it, would
carry echoes of tragedy, were it less
wordy and if our couple did not have to
reverse its behavior completely. For
two decades they had no inkling that
they hated each other! Over the whole,
like cellophane, spreads a film of ver-
nacularly, bright in parts but well below
what, say, Alan Seymour has given us.
The play is too slow. A cast of two,
cooped up in one room, offers problems
which subtler practitioners have solved
without recourse to blary effects which
do not advance the excitement. Certainly,
there are recognisable Australian attitu-
des, interludes of briskness, pathos oc-
casionally and something reaching out to
be humor, but it is still the oldest of old
hat (battered trilby), and in the large,
artistic sense it lacks truth because there
is no dimension of discovery.
The hope survives that Australians
can do better than this. Indeed, it is a
certainty. Those who launched this in-
sectivorous marsupial have not kept up
with the times. Native realities? Gamey
dialogue? Yes but by now it takes
more than a rough old ridge.
Richard Campion’s production makes
vigorous and intelligent use of its oppor-
tunities, and the internal rotation of
Richard Prins’ evocative main set pro-
vides helpful diversity. The acting is un-
impeachable. Though Roma Johnston
cannot gain much of our sympathy for
Gladys, if anyone could it would be she:
she is almost uncannily right in every
gesture. The same holds for Alan Hop-
good as Les Baxter. The thought keeps
intruding that Mr Hopgood, a play-
wright himself, could have made a nice
burletta of the various materials in Miss
Dreyer’s basket.

TELEVISION
Otherwise Awful
Otherwise Engaged. ABC Television.
Love in a Small Town. ATN-7.
Imagine a successful businessman who
realises that he has lost touch with his
spoiled family. His wife lives in a mad
artistic whirl, his eternal, undergraduate
son is about to take his “finals” once
more, his daughter is about to engage
with the wrong man. So Dad buys a
Pacific island, bundles wife and offspring
into a flying boat, and maroons them for
six months of all round readjustment.
What a fine basis for a television
comedy! Imagine the development of the
story as over-civilised people adjust to
primitive surroundings, scheme to make
Dad pay for his actions, and as he sees
them succumbing to the simple life and
comments slyly on that! Imagine any
number of things, but not the story
evolved by John Cameron, who works in
television and who set out “purely to
entertain a television audience . . . the
plot develops visually”.
Unhappily the playwright’s imagina-
tion was not equal to his basic plot, and
“Otherwise Engaged” neither entertained
nor developed more than a sense of
disappointment at a promising idea un-
realised. The play had too little fun at
adult level, too much kindergarten non-
sense.
Unfortunately for Mr Cameron and
ABC Television, the same night’s viewing
included a British ATV play called “Love
in a Small Town”, well written, intensely
acted, full of conflict and twists, some-
thing to experience rather than merely
watch.
This play, with Tony Britton, Faith
Brook and Judi Dench, should be given
another showing, if only to a roomful
of those critics who assert that we have
loads of real acting talent in Australia,
and writers and directors who believe
they know how to entertain by develop-
ing a story visually.

MUSIC
Suicidal Urge
Subscription Concert (Red Series). Sydney
Symphony Orchestra conducted by Dean
Dixon. Soloist: Heather Harper.
One wonders at the nature of this
mysterious suicidal urge which drives
romantically - inclined conductors to
tackle the complexity of Bach. Un-
fortunately Mr Dixon must be included
in this already large number of con-
ductors. His alarmingly pedestrian read-
ing of the Brandenburg Concerto No. 3
seemed all the. more uninspiring when
compared to the powerful and moving
Mahler of only a fortnight ago. Varia-
tions in tempo, especially in the basses
and ’celli, destroyed the relentless
rhythmic drive which is the basic quality
of Bach’s music. Perhaps the fault here
lies more with the orchestra, which
played with a particularly dry and life-
less tone, than with Mr Dixon, although
his lack of directions seemed to be
indicative of an indifferent state of mind.
The performance was further hindered
by the orchestra’s harpsichordist who
doggedly refuses to employ sensible
registrations on her instrument.
Visiting English soprano Heather Har-
per fortunately found no difficulty in
raising the musical standard from these
inauspicious beginnings. Her choice of
the “Four Last Songs” by Richard
Strauss afforded us an opportunity to
study her ability in interpretation as
well as to enjoy the fullness and warmth
of her voice.
The second half of the programme
was devoted to a performance of
Prokofiev’s cantata “Alexander Nevsky”.
Written in 1938 as the music for Eisen-
stein’s celebrated film of the same name,
it is scored for full orchestra, chorus,
mezzo soprano soloist and a formidable
battery of 13 percussion instruments. As
a first Australian performance it was a
sad reflection on the state of music in
this country when one realises that it is
a full-scale work by a major composer
and has had to wait 27 years for an
audience.
The standard of playing in the Sydney
Symphony Orchestra always seems to
rise in the direct proportion of the num-
ber of players required in a given work.
Wednesday night was to be no excep-
tion and with the new Hurlstone Choir
to swell their ranks the orchestra con-
fidently strode through this, series of
Russian musical pictorials. Heather Har-
per returned to sing the elegy on the
“Field of the Dead”, confirming the
opinion that she is both a sensitive and
proficient singer.

The Stories of Henry Lawson. First, Second,
Third Series. Ed. Cecil Mann. Angus and
Robertson. 355. each.
When Henry Lawson was a child in
Pipeclay he used to believe, so he
remembers in “A Fragment of Autobio-
graphy”, that “the sun went down behind
the ridge across the Cudgegong River,
and then all round, behind the Mudgee
mountains, and behind old Mount
Buckaroo in the west, and then rose
again. It took him all night to go round.”
The daily journey of the sun marked the
absolute limits of his world. There is
nothing surprising about that. Many a
child’s world is limited to what it can
see. Beyond, where imagination must do
the work of sight, might be China, Peru,
Baghdad or Sydney. But for Henry Law-
son the writer, as distinct from Henry
Lawson the child, that early life, dry,
poverty-stricken, lonely, where the whole
world and the planets too were circum-
scribed by the Mudgee mountains, must
have shaped literary destiny. Looking
back on it now one feels that here, per-
haps, he acquired that habit of concen-
trated observation from which his stories
grow.
There is no need to recite the story of
Henry Lawson, which is presented in
these volumes through his writings and
his admirable commentator, Cecil Mann.
His life was a legend, and he turned into
legend the lives of the outback and city
battlers whose oddities caught his eye,
or whose miseries, wrung from him a
sympathy which sprang from his “heart
full of love for Australia, and hatred for
wrong and injustice”. Now that his
stories are collected in these three large
volumes we have a fresh opportunity to
assess Lawson's place in our literary
world. For, as Cecil Mann had pointed
out, we cannot assume that his present
“nationally unique status” will remain
unchanged. In Mann’s words, “. . . he
may become the most outstanding writer
and literary figure of a period, rather
than of a people.” Establishment in this
more modest literary corner could not,
however, be thought of as a fall from
grace, but rather as a just recognition of
his capacities. For the very spirit of the
’nineties, which welcomed his representa-
tion of Australian life, imposed its limi-
tations upon him; just as the virtues
which shine forth so clearly in his best
stories meet the reader as defects in his
flimsier ones and they are many.
At his best, Lawson observes with pre-
cision and records in detail. Whether
writing comedy, or his own special mix-
ture of pathos and toughness, he shows
a lively sense of occasion. Even in those
stories where there is a grand climax,
there are often minor victories as well;
in some, where the grand climax is mis-
calculated, the minor occasions may
strike one with even greater force. “Shall
We Gather at the River?” provides an
excellent example of his characteristic
merits and defects, so often, as in this
story, to be found side by side. Here
Lawson has a more than promising sub-
ject—the character and message of an
HENRY LAWSON
itinerant preacher in a drought-ridden
land. But though Lawson begins with
the precise yet casual manner which
comes so easily to him, he allows the
story to dissolve, first in tendentious
rhetoric, and finally in sentiment, sobs
and tears. Not content to have drawn
the landscape of a withered, drought-
stricken country, he must force us to
notice that it is incongruous for a group
of parched bushmen and their women
to be singing “Shall We Gather at the
River?” in the middle of a barren, water-
less plain; and he must send them away
from Peter M’Laughlan’s sermon with
lumps in their throats and tears in their
eyes. But in spite of the miscalculations,
and the fading of the story’s initial
promise, Lawson scores one triumph,
and it is a characteristic one. It is
suggested to Peter M’Laughlan by a
“gentlemanly parson” that he should
offer prayers for rain. The story con-
tinues:
Peter held up his finger and said
“Listen!”
Now, with a big mob of travelling
stock camped on the plain at night
there is always a lowing, soughing or
moaning sound, a sound like that of
the sea on the shore at a little distance;
and, altogether, it might be called the
sigh or yawn of a big mob in camp.
But the long, low moaning of cattle
dying of hunger and thirst on the hot
barren plain in a drought is altogether
different, and at night there is some-
thing awful about it you couldn’t
describe it. This is what Peter
M’Laughlan heard.
“Do you hear that?” he asked the
other preacher.
The little parson said he did. Per-
haps he only heard the weak lowing
of cattle.
Do you think that God will hear
us when He does not hear that?'’ asked
Peter.
Into that small scene is packed the
real quality of Lawson’s talent.
The view he offers is utterly real, and
utterly disillusioned. He looks hard at
the unlovely facts, and they need no
coating of sentiment to commend them
to the reader.
Even in his comic stories there is often
an undertone of complete disillusion-
ment. His laughter erupts from the grev-
ness of existence. His “Wild Irishman”
is an uproarious character off on a crazy
spree, but none of his antics can make us
forget that he is a derelict. Even in “The
Loaded Dog”, where boisterous farce
suddenly springs out of a community of
struggling prospectors, and their ram-
shackle collection of huts and following
of scuffling, mangy dogs, the comedy
gains point from, and directs us back to,
the squalor of its environment. Lawson's
triumphs, here as elsewhere, are those of
the writer who, like the boy watching the
sun circle the Mudgee mountains, looked
with intense concentration at a small
segment of life. His best prose repro-
duces accurately, yet without becoming
unduly weighty, the details of the life he
knew. Who, for example, reading “The
Golden Graveyard” can fail to see each
yard of the miners’ progress, or decline
to stoop with them beneath the pro-
truding edge of hastily shored-up coffins?
It is Lawson’s great gift not only to see
clearly himself but to make others see
and retain the image in the mind's eye.
Yet this strength is also his limitation.
He has peopled Sydney and Western New
South Wales with characters who fill his
hard landscape as memorably as do
Furphy’s the Riverina. They live in their
gestures, appearance, their deeds and
their words. Lawson’s extraordinarily de-
scriptive power lends to them a kind of


purious life and reality. But his talents

While, then, this three volume edition
,ust remind us yet again of the sheer
Lilk of Lawson s prose, it must also
;mind us of the limitations of his art.
ito the third volume Cecil Mann has
at material not included in the earlier
Elected edition, and some writing which
has not appeared in book form before,
We now have gathered together all the
substantial evidence upon which an as-
sessment of Lawson’s achievement needs
to be based; and we have too an extremely
useful commentary, notes, and six critical
essays by Lawson’s contemporaries. I
found that my reading of this mass of
material tended more and more to
confirm A. G. Stephens’ assessment of
forty years ago, “Much of his work re-
mains fo Australia; very little to the
world.” The boy who saw the Mudgee
mountains marking the boundaries of
“The World” became the writer for
whom they blotted out the horizons of
a larger and more profound view of life.
Potty about Sid
By DAVID McNICOLL
ne Traveller’s Africa. Cynthia Nolan.
Methuen. 665.
/hat do people visualise when they
jiink of Africa? With some, I imagine,
s natives; with others, wild animals of
ie larger varieties. I. unfortunately, early
weloped a mental block against Africa
irough listening to a couple of big-game
.inters. First. Hemingway. As a novice
ar correspondent I listened to him ex-
panding for hours in a restaurant in
; Mans about the joys of big-game
looting. Hemingway was a born ear-
isher and he always had a ready-made
ptive audience among the correspon-
ds, who were impressed not so much
r his being the author of one good
>ok but by the fact that Colliers was
tying him a dollar a word for his war
tverage. Ernest said that big-game
inting brought out the realities in life,
parated the men from the boys. He
iplied there was some sort of a sex
ing to it as well. After listening to his
isly exploits 1 decided that anyone who
ot an elephant was a barbarian.
Then there was Robert Ruark. He has
deavored to persuade me over a 15-
ar span that big-game shooting is the
timate in sensation. About five years
o I was delighted when he told me he
d shot his last water-buck, and his
annlichers were to go in permanent
trage. Then, damn it, he announced he
is off to Mozambique to get some rare
3e, of gazelle which had escaped his
;hts. Ruark’s views turned me more
in ever against a visit to Africa.
But Moorehead’s books did the trick,
d when I went to that magic world
:ursed myself for not having made the
grimage sooner. It is easier to get to
st Africa than you would think. You
a leave Sydney at 10 a.m. by Air India
d be in Nairobi (via Bombay) for
ernoon tea next day. Have a look
fore it’s too late.
Cynthia Nolan, who is the wife of the
artist, has written a book about East
Africa entitled, “One Traveller’s Africa”.
Mrs. Nolan writes with clarity and sim-
plicity a refreshing change in these
days of tortuous attempts to make some-
thing new of our wonderful language.
Her eye is quick and observant, and she
has the essential curiosity of the traveller
who gets something from travel.
It is perhaps natural that Cynthia
Nolan should be overshadowed by her
husband. Her admiration for him is
boundless, and it is apparent that many
of her impressions are through his eyes,
his flashbacks, his imagery. Those Nolan
fans who have imagined that he must
see nothing but Ned Kelly in his dreams
will be interested to discover in this
book that Ned Kelly takes second place
to the French poet, Rimbaud. Apparently
Nolan formed an earlier acquaintance
with Rimbaud's works and has been in-
fluenced by them throughout his life. If
there is one feature of this book which
becomes unnecessarily repetitious it is
the scores of references to Rimbaud.
Cynthia Nolan obviously loves wild
animals, which, in my eyes, makes her a
real person. Her descriptions of animals
are warm and vital she can make an
otter sound an entrancing companion and
a pink-eared hippo positively cuddly.
She brings savage leopards into focus,
and makes the elephant as sagacious as
one would hope. I was delighted to read
that elephants kill those who hunt and
torture them, and that they have been
known to stamp on the tusks of a dead
elephant to break the ivory and make it
useless to poachers.
The Nolans threw a wide net in
Africa; they met whites, natives, officials,
explorers, missionaries, the Jot. Cynthia
Nolan feels strongly about the injustices
suffered by colored people and she has
allowed her feelings to seep into the pages
of her book. I have never met her, but I
know that if we met we would soon
tangle on the rights and wrongs of racial
issues. It is a commonplace to say that
criticism of whites’ attitude to coloreds
is easy if you have never actually lived
in the country concerned. But, common-
place as it is, the argument must be put
forward. Mrs. Nolan obviously has the
word ‘‘exploitation” high in her mind
when she writes about colored peoples.
But it is only fair to remember that
development of Africa was largely a 19th
century affair when the methods of mod-
ern development were absent and when
physical toil and use of native labor were
the means by which progress eventuated.
Development was unfortunately syno-
nymous with seizure and exploitation.
And. but for the exploitation, the colored
people of Africa would not be making
their chaotic way towards self-govern-
ment.
But this is carping. Cynthia Nolan is
a first-rate travel writer and. considering
she had to make her notes and look after
Sidney as well, her effort is prodigious.
(He might be a great artist and a great
man for visions, but as a travelling com-
panion he sounds like hell. He is bur-
dened by five cameras, plus lenses; he
leaves money and valuables behind in
hotels and airports; he goes into trances
when he is angry or crossed; he sets off
alone on long walks and drives, and
generally sounds like an extra from “The
Outer Limits”.)
But obviously travel without Sidney
would be of no interest to Mrs. Nolan.
And, as the end result is first class, it’s
just as well she takes him along, Rim-
baud and all. May I also mention that
the book is illustrated with Nolan paint-
ings of Africa. They are superb, as
magical as one has come to expect.
Memsahib Nolan has done Africa
proud in this book. In my view she has
not captured the limitless African land-
scape as well as she has its animals. She
and her husband seem to have missed
visiting the Ngoro-Ngoro crater, which
is a pity, for her pen would have done a
grand job on that incredible hole in the
ground. As a travel book, this one
should be rated high. And apart from
anything else it demonstrates that al-
though Cynthia may be keen about
Africa she is positively potty about Sid.

Notes and Counternotes. Eugene lonesc
Calder. 5355.
Some years ago I attended a lectui
given by lonesco at the French Institu
in London. Speaking about his own play]
and about the writing of plays generalll
he stressed that a play is not somethir
that can be explained or demonstrate!
or even read, but something to be acte
“It is not a lecture, but a piece of livir
evidence. If it fails to be this, it fails i
be a play.”
This can hardly be disputed: the pla-
wright's words are intended to be spoke
as surely as the composer’s notes exist 1
be played. But when lonesco went on i
say that “the writer with a thesis alienah
the freedom of his characters”, I four
myself musing on the fact that his fine
plays up till then had seemed to be, at
mittedly lively and inventive, illustr;
tions of the thesis that any real commun
cation between human beings is almo
impossible. The early one-act plays, “Th
Bald Prima Donna”, “The Lesson” an
“The Chairs”, were all variations on th
theme, and none the worse for that. “Th
New Tenant”, a kind of intellects
comic - strip, showed, to immense!
humorous effect, a man constructing h
own predicament, building his lonel
world out of walls.
I am not insisting that the thesis pn
ceded the plays; and, of course, lonesco
own interpretation of a play he ha
written is as valid as any other critic’:
though not necessarily more so. But it i
curious to find him, in this collection o
essays, continually stressing his ow
freedom from what he thinks of as arii
theorising about the theatre, and attack
ing those playwrights whose method h
sees as differing from his own. He is, ’r
implication, as unfair to Arthur Mills
as he is to Brecht, of whom he is foolei
into taking the simple view that he is
rather boring didactic playwright wh.
might have written works of marginail;
greater interest, if he hadn’t chosen t<
write down to an ignorant East Germai
public.
If he is not very illuminating abou
other writers, he is hardly more so abou
himself. He is at his most sympathetic
when he complain's, with justice, that tot
often he has been judged not by dram<
critics or even by literary critics bu
by moralists. “And by moralists,” he
writes, “I mean fanatical, dogmatic ant!
ideological theologians of every creed,’
The famous exchange of letters witf
Kenneth Tynan in “The Observer” in 1956
is reprinted. Tynan, who had earlier been
an enthusiastic supporter of lonesco, and
who had written an extremely favorable
notice of “The Chairs” in 1955, changed


IN EVERY WAY
SUPERIOR
In every field, there’s
a leader—superior*
to all others. Some
people have this
undenied excellence.
So do some products
—the Parker 61, for
example. Take note
of the pens used by
people who lead in
their professions and
occupations. Almost
invariably, they use
Parker 61. As practical people,
they have practical reasons for
selecting the Parker 61. They value
its absolute dependability (that
instant response as gold point
touches paper) and its amazing
capillary action which automatically
fills the Parker 61 without the
aid of moving parts. Parker’s
superb styling commends itself to
people with an eye to
beauty. And there’s one
thoroughly impractical reason
for owning a Parker 61—pride.

his opinion when the play was revived in
1958, and wrote one of his sillier pole-
mical pieces, concluding that “M. lones-
co’s theatre is pungent and exciting, but
it remains a diversion. It is not on the
main road: and we do him no good, nor
the drama at large, to pretend that it is.”
The main road led, I presume, to
Marxville. Well, it may be a main road,
but, aesthetically speaking, it’s a pretty
deserted one, except for the occasional
superannuated vehicle one sees being
towed along it by the Moscow Arts
Theatre. Not even Brecht can be ade-
quately described as a Marxist dramatist.
Elsewhere in this book, lonesco tells
a story about a brilliant young English
critic who had written a laudatory review
of “The Chairs”. He and lonesco subse-
quently met at a friend’s house, and the
critic told lonesco that he could, if he
wanted, be the greatest writer in the
theatre today. lonesco eagerly asked for
the recipe. “It’s very easy,” answered the
critic. “We are only waiting for you to
deliver us a message. Up to now your
plays do not have the message we were
hoping from you. Be a Marxist, be
Brechtian!”
The story is so unbelievable that it
must, I suppose, be true. “This critic
could not forgive me. And he showed it.
A few months later, at the revival of the
same play, he wrote a fairly long article,
in which he was bent on proving that he
had been mistaken the first time in prais-
ing the play so highly. . .” No comment.

Hear No Evil...
Thirty-eight Witnesses. A. M. Rosenthal.
McGraw-Hill. 31s.
jThis book, by the City Editor of “The
New York Times”, derives from what
started as a brief four-paragraph story
in that paper on March 14, 1964. The
heading, in small type, read: “Queen’s
Woman Is Stabbed to Death in Front
of Home”. Two weeks later it became
a front-page story.
This development was due to a curious
circumstance. Apparently for more than
half an hour in the early hours of
March 13, 38 citizens had watched the
killer stalk and stab his victim in three
separate attacks. Twice the sound of
voices and windows opening and the
sudden glow of lights frightened him off.
Each time he returned to the attack.
Despite the victim’s screams for help, no
one intervened; nor did anyone telephone
the police during the assault. Only after
the woman was dead did one witness call.
The story had a follow-up. Sociolo-
gists, psychologists, psychiatrists, theo-
logians were asked what they thought.
[One psychiatrist said the incident was
typical; another called it atypical. A
good deal of jargon was used: “aliena-
tion of the individual”, “the disaster
syndrome”, and so on. A theologian
said that it showed how far “deper-
sonalising” had gone in New York, and
added with unconscious irony, “Don’t
}uote me”.
The police blamed the public, saying
they had long been concerned about
apathy in reporting crimes. The public
blamed the police. “To my amazement,”
says Mr Rosenthal, “the favorite target
ay. far was the police. Everybody was
at them . . .” “Have you ever reported
anything to the police?” one letter-writer
asked. “If you did, you would know that
fou are subjected to insults and abuse
. . being told to mind your own busi-
less, or go away, take a walk.”
Yet the police were at the scene of
the crime within two minutes of being
called. The caller was neither insulted
nor abused. Moreover, six days later a
man was arrested and charged with
homicide. If any one of the 38 wit-
nesses had put in a call while the victim
was being attacked the chances are that
she would have been saved.
Mr Rosenthal occasionally writes
rather inflated prose, talking of the story
as “a revelation about the human condi-
tion so appalling to contemplate that
only good can come from forcing one-
self to confront the truth”. Yet it is un-
questionably a story which has consider-
able relevance to the situation in this
country in regard to relations between
the police and the public. And no doubt
some good, did come of it; if only that
New Yorkers were made to realise how
much police work is hampered by apathy'
and the refusal to bear witness.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A Double for Larke
A nnual Report Award time has rolled
around again, with Larke Consoli-
dated Industries Ltd winning (for two
years in a row) the Australian Institute
of Management’s award for the best
report from a listed company. The Aus-
tralian National Line received the pat
for the best report from an unlisted or-
ganisation.
There are criticisms and disappoint-
ments, of course. But the real success of
the AlM’s award is the keen interest it
is encouraging among companies and
government organisations, and the im-
proved information being given to em-
ployees and the public.
Those who were disappointed at not
winning at least one of the 50 merit
awards can console themselves with the
feeling that the basic object, after all, is
to educate the public to a better under-
standing of what goes on in business.
The growing recognition of the res-
ponsibilities of better reporting in in-
dustry was emphasised by the record
turn-up at the annual dinner at The
Australia, Sydney, on June 2, liberally
sprinkled with representatives from all
the major States.
The merit award list for non-listed or-
ganisations contained names like the
Boy Scouts’ Association, Department of
Motor Transport, Marine Board of
Devonport (Tas.), Royal Children’s Hos-
pital (Melbourne) and the Royal Ryde
Homes. Even the Mosman Rowing Club
got into the act.
To encourage such widespread inter-
est indeed must be achieving the objects
of the early pioneers of this award, par-
ticularly in creating employee pride in
organisations and in the products and
services which they provide.
Yet, it is no time to let up. The AIM
annual award, the new Companies Act,
the constantly revised Stock Exchange
regulations and the recently introduced
Bill on Restrictive Trade Practices are
all prodding management into a better
relationship with shareholders and the
public.
The AIM annual report award next
year, its 15th year, will consider half-
yearly reports of companies and pay
strict attention to the clarity of type-face
used in printing. Photographs of directors
are not the only thing welcome in an
annual report. And, as Mr Norman Bede
Rydge said, his granddaughter Mandy
must be able to understand it.
Mr Stan Owens, speaking for the ad-
judicators, said that the beginning of
wisdom is to call things by their proper
names. Too much detail was being put
into the balance sheets and not enough
use was being made of “notes” to the
balance sheets as explanations, he men-
tioned.
Failure to disclose turnover is still a
criticism of big companies, while the
weaknesses in valuing stocks (long de-
plored by finance writers) still prompt the
request for a valuation which is “the
lowest of cost, market selling value or
replacement price.”
Mr Owens, who is an FCA, drew atten-
tion to the weaknesses in accounting and
auditing by indicating there were no
principles, which the writer interpreted
as meaning that, although there were
certain guidelines, there were no set
principles which would bring uniform
accounting into balance sheet presenta-
tion. Finance writers for years have
urged a uniformity of presentation in
public accounts so that a clear-cut assess-
ment may be made. If everyone followed
a set pattern, for example, in classifying
stocks, depreciation, fixed assets, invest-
ments, etc., there would be fewer mis-
leading balance sheets.
One final plea is for the small or not-
so-small company which presents all the
facts though does not wish to spend
shareholders’ money on an expensive
report, but merely roneos its balance
sheet on foolscap paper.
The ATM stresses that the cost of
producing an annual report should not
be excessive and that it can be produced
within an organisation, such as that pub-
lished by the Department of Motor
Transport, NSW.
Mr G. R. Allman, of Larke Consoli-
dated, said his company’s balance sheets
had cost 9s. Id. each (presumably on the
basis of 3,000 copies to supply 2,785
stockholders). If it cost nearly £1,500
to produce a 28-page report, it certainly
would cost a lot more for a company
with 50,000 shareholders, without con-
sidering the time of the team of people
involved in preparing it.
A small company, if it can produce
within its own organisation all the neces-
sary facts and explanations, without
costly illustrations, should be encouraged
to do just that and a special award should
be given each year for the most informa-
tive but economical report.
Those who fear that the trend in
recent years has sometimes been to-
wards bigger and more glossy reports
will be glad to learn from Mr Owens
G. R. ALLMAN
that “cost alone is no criterion of a good
report, and in fact several companies
have lost awards in the past because of
excessive cost”. He has also pointed the
way towards simplicity by commending
the elimination of unnecessary statistical
detail and the production of less formal
documents. A prime aim is ease of
understanding.
Auditing Standards Again
recent years accountants and
auditors have subjected themselves
to considerable heart-searching in an
effort to reach more uniform standards
of technique and judgment on account-
ing problems. The great company
crashes and their concomitant discussion
of auditors' responsibilities furnished a
sufficient goad.
It was good to see the debate con-
tinued to some effect at last week’s third
Australian Congress of Chartered
Accountants in Adelaide. The difficulties
of uniformity of interpretation are cer-
tainly not to be minimised. Many experts
still maintain that there will never be
one exclusive way of handling any given
accounting situation.
Nevertheless, Mr J. L. Blacket, ACA,
in his paper “The Purpose of an Audit”,
believed the attempt should be made by
the professional institutes. “Surely it is
time and possible,” he maintained, “to
set down in a series of recommendations
our belief in what is the one best way
to deal with an accounting problem.”
Mr Blacket called up telling support
from an article by H. E. Miller in the
October, 1964, “Journal of Account-
ancy” (USA). Miller provocatively argues
“. . . there should be only a single set
of accounting principles with a minimum
number of acceptable alternate pro-
cedures”.
“Rather than tolerate, or even


advocate as some accountants have, an
either-or position because of uncertainty
about which among several alternatives
is best, wouldn’t the profession be in a
better light if it undertook to make
choices from among the alternatives and
drop those not chosen, even with the
realisation on the part of all concerned
that best possible choices might not
always be made?” Miller asks.
The matter is far from academic,
for Mr Blacket is compelled to admit:
“In practice, I believe, there has been
a limitation in the extent to which we
are prepared to qualify our reports,
where the circumstances warrant it.”
One or two investigators of the com-
pany crashes have commented upon this
reluctance to qualify and the consequent
tendency to seek acceptable compro-
mises. In America, apparently, auditors’
comments are accepted as normal and
not a disgrace. The evolution of report-
ing standards w'ould aid the process in
Australia.
US and UK Markets
T>lunt economic factors still call the
tune throughout the UK share-
markets. Wall Street, on the other hand,
seems immersed in a wide measure of
technical correction, though a spate of
analysts is tending to agree that the
downward phase will be over fairly soon.
The analysts are presumably heartened
by the Administration’s quick and practi-
cal steps to defeat any slowing of the
US economy late in 1965. The House has
passed a 4.8 billion dollars cut in excise
taxes, to be spread over four years and
beginning on July 1. The Senate is even
expected to hasten some of the reduc-
tions.
On that account it might have been ex-
pected that Wall Street was ready to by-
pass the grim warning of similarities be-
tween the present economic situation and
that of the late 1920 s uttered by Federal
Reserve Board chairman Martin. His
words, and Vietnam, left a few marks,
however.
Friday’s dealings could be called firm,
though the actual closing rally was not
particularly deep when spread over the
light volumes. Steels made small gains,
motors were uneven yet rising on balance,
while a few prominent chemicals, like
Eastman Kodak, Allied Chemical and
Union Carbide, edged up.
London took temporary encourage-
ment from May’s lift in the UK gold and
foreign currency reserves and more ob-
viously from the lowering of Bank Rate.
Yet fresh hire-purchase restrictions sent
equities back, with some quite heavy
individual falls.
EMI, Imperial Tobacco, Thorn Electri-

ance were among the biggest losers.

Parsimonious Treatment
For Premiers
Lifting the betterment factor
IPhe Commonwealth had to take a par-
simonious line with the Premiers
this year simply because of the pros-
pect of greatly increased defence com-
mitments. Some of the Premiers argued
their cases for more money on the
grounds that a good deal of their own
spending is related to defence. This had
some effect, notably at the Loan Council
meeting. The Commonwealth also listen-
ed with a sympathetic ear to claims on
the score of drought and the effect of
wage increases on State Budgets.
Ironically enough, Mr Holt, the Fede-
ral Treasurer, probably thinking more
of new revenue-raising proposals he has
H. E. BOLTE
in mind for August rather than the lean
time which seems to be ahead in loan-
raising to meet the overall needs of his
next cash Budget, did not plague the Pre-
miers so much with talk of shortages of
money. What he feared most, he told
them, was uneconomic competition for
resources in the event of State Govern-
ment spending getting over the odds. He
pressed this point home by insisting
that in loan allocations for 1965-66 the
States settle for an increase on last year
of only £6.5 million to £296.5 million,
including a £1.5 million special payment
for NSW to build grain elevators. The
latter, strictly speaking, should come
under semi-government loan allocations,
which remain substantially the same for
next year as for 1964-65.
When it came to the point, the
Premiers mildly accepted the Common-
wealth's proposals for the revision of the
old formula and put forward none of
their own for replacing it with one based
on different lines. At the previous con-
ference in April some expansive theories
were bandied about, especially on the
manner in which growth should be taken
into account. But behind all the talk
the Premiers probably felt that their two
best lines of approach were to go for a
bigger basic amount on the one hand
and for a reasonable increase in the
betterment adjustment factor on the
other. In effect, the basic element in
the grants remains unchanged in the
revised formula to be operative over
the next five years. But the Common-
wealth bowed to pleas from the Premiers
that, at any rate for next year, they
should get rather more than the revised
formula provided for.
It was only when its proposals were
shown to give the States less than they
would have got under the old formula
that the Premiers dug their toes in and
succeeded, at any rate for 1965-66, the
first year of the new agreement, in get-
ting more than they would otherwise
have. It was left to the Victorian Pre-
mier, Mr. Bolte, who feared to go home
without something more tangible to show
an expectant audience, to stage a late-
night ruse to get more for his own State
than provided in the offer accepted by
the other States. It worked to the tune of
£600,000, though the dodge riled the
other Premiers who more or less had to
accept it in the interest of harmony and
sleep. When they arrived fresh for the
Loan Council meeting next day, at least
Mr Askin was ready to profit by the
lesson to get his £1.5 million loan bonus.
The main gain for the States in the re-
vised agreement lies in the increase it
provides for in the betterment factor. Any
illusions the Premiers might have had
after the preliminary Premiers’ Con-
ference in April that the Commonwealth
would accept Mr Renshaw’s rather fan-
ciful suggestion that the betterment fac-
tor be raised to 3 per cent had been
knocked firmly on the head at the Trea-
sury officials’ conference with the State
Under-Treasurers last month. Mr Askin
didn’t press the proposal.
The betterment factor was introduced


into the calculation of tax reimburse-
ments in 1949 as an adjustment factor for
wage increases. For that year, and until
1959, it remained at 1 per cent. At the
1959 Premiers’ Conference it was in-
creased to 1.1 per cent, to be effective in
1960-61. This meant that, in addition
to reimbursements being adjusted State
by State for population increases, they
would also be adjusted for 1.1 times the
percentage increase, if any, in average
wages for Australia as a whole in the pre-
ceding year. In the revised formula now
agreed on by the States, the betterment
factor has been increased to 1.2 per cent.
By doing this the Commonwealth has
promised to reduce the time lag in com-
pensating the States for wage increases.
In a year when wages are rising at more
than a normal rate, such as in a year of
big increase in basic wage like last year,
reductions in the lag stand to prove of
great benefit to the States. Indeed, the lag
was one of Mr Boite’s bigger bones of
contention when framing Victoria’s Bud-
get for the current year, in that he had
to find additional amounts in his Budget
to finance increase in wages which would
not be taken into account in tax reim-
bursements until the following year.
In the round-up, the total tax reim-
bursement grants to be shared by the
States next year will amount to £376.4
million. This is £5.4 million more than
the Commonwealth first offered at the
conference, £3.2 million more than they
would have had under the previous for-
mula, and £35.4 million more than they
received for 1964-65. The figure for
next year includes special grants of £1
million for Queensland, to take account
of the lag in accurately computing the
population of that State, and the
£600,000 extra awarded to Victoria.
If the results of this year's Premiers’
Conference and past experience are any-
thing to go by, the projected annual
“formula” figures for grants, which rise
to £503.1 million in 1969-70, are no
more than rough guide-lines as to what
the States will get. The Premiers will
always ask for more than the agreed for-
mula provides. The horse-trading invari-
ably gets them something extra. However,
at next year's conference they won’t be
able to argue that the now-agreed for-
mula will give a lower total than the
old one, as happened for 1965-66. For
the last four years to 1969-70, the revised
formula gives a higher total than the old
one. The difference is only £2.6 mil-
lion in its favor in 1966-67, but it in-
creases progressively until in 1969-70
it will be as much as £18.3 million.
Looked at simply in terms of what is
likely to be the harvest from the loan
market this year, it would be thought
that the Loan Council is being rather
optimistic in setting the loan total at
£295 million for Government works. The
Government will be lucky if it succeeds
in borrowing anything very much, except
perhaps some Euro-dollars in overseas
capital markets next year. Both New
York and London seem to be pretty
determined to stop the outflow of capi-
tal. At home, although the Common-
wealth's last loan (for £4O million) was
filled readily enough, it was a relatively
small one compared with the majority
of loans in recent years. There are no
obvious signs that the capital market
will be any more receptive of Govern-
ment issues than it has been in the cur-
rent year, when two out of four loans
were undersubscribed by a considerable
margin.
Scanning the possibilities in the loan
market, the Government can hardly be
encouraged by the recent backsliding of
savings bank deposits. Though fixed de-
posits in the trading banks to some ex-
tent offset the fall in savings bank de-
posits, and the trading banks look likely
to be called upon in increasing measure
to subscribe to Government loans this
year, the decline in savings bank deposits,
if it continues, seems bound to have a
serious impact on the overall loan result.
However, in these days of cash
Budgets when loan raisings and ordinary
revenue are all thrown into the same
Government pot, possibly the Treasurer
is not worrying unduly whether he gets
all of the £295 million allocated to the
States for works and housing next year
from the loan market or not. In the
interest of monetary stability, of course,
he should, and he will doubtless do his
best to cull all he can from the loan
market. It seems that, perforce, he will
have a big gap to fill between loan re-
ceipts from the market and loan alloca-
tions. He will be looking to fill it from
taxation revenue. This is probably one
of the main reasons, apart from the
Government’s own increased spending
commitments, why Mr Calwell and mosT
other observers are expecting a tough
Budget.
CROESUS
Arrested Hopes in Aluminium
Should BHP enter the field?
Qetting on profits is a protracted pro-
cess for an aluminium complex
starting from scratch in the promised
land. More evidence of this came from
Alcoa of Australia last week. One is not
so surprised or shocked as supposedly
are Australian shareholders in the three
local mining companies with big, albeit
even in combination minority, stakes in
the Alcoa set-up, that the meeting of
prospectus estimates of profits by this
year and dividends by next looks out of
the question. Indeed, with Alcoa's chair-
man, Mr Lindesay Clark, expecting
another loss to follow 1964’s whopper
(£1.6 million or £3.7 million according
to how you read it), the prospectus hori-
zons have vanished for the time being.
It is just a nice coincidence that the
new shares issued by Broken Hill South
and North Broken Hill in association
with their participation in Alcoa have
qualified for dividends (as from Decern-
ber, 1964) at a time when most of the
other interests of these companies have
been booming. The same cannot be
said for the third, Western Mining, which
has the largest Australian participation,
20 p.c. in Alcoa, compared with South’s
16.6 and North's 12 p.c. Western Mining
just has to jog along in the unglittering
world of Australian gold mining, where
its main bread and butter still has to
come from, pending the blossoming of
its aluminium and iron ore interests. In
the meantime its new shares issued to
get in funds for Alcoa have been ranking
for dividend since last August.
It is not surprising that this has hap-
pened because, frankly, for all the
magnificence of Alcoa’s achievements in
establishing its aluminium complex here
in double quick time since the project
was started in 1961, profits would have
to depend on the rate at which develop-
ment expenses were written off as well
as the not so predictable costs of estab-
lishment, the gearing of the enterprise
to full-scale economical working and suc-
cess in penetrating the Australian market,
As a matter of fact, with something like
£4B million of capital involved in the
enterprise (though not all this has been
spent yet), it was unrealistic of the pro-
moters to dangle any date before a pay-
off to Australian participants in the
equity, the more so since the lion's share
of the funds has been borrowed on long-
term from the US parent, Alcoa of
America.
The decision announced last week to
change the company’s write-off policy in
relation to preliminary, pre-operating and
exploration expenditure was certainly a
last-minute affair, because only a couple
of months ago I asked a leading question
to a director on this very point and got
a rather different answer. In the event,
by now writing off the unamortised
balances of these expenditures to profit
and loss account, the consolidated net
loss of £1,663,251 (after providing for
amortisation on the same basis as in
previous years) is lifted by £2,087,733
on account of the additional write-offs
to £3,750,984. This makes the accumu-

lated loss, to the end of 1964, £5,464,989.
So there is quite a bit of slack to be
taken up before the Australian par-
ticipants will get in sight of a dividend.
I do not doubt for a moment that this
loss will be wiped off in the next three
years or less. For one thing, depreciation
charges are particularly high and, as the
report says, this bears heavily on profit-
ability when output is below optimum.
Moreover, most of the teething troubles
are over and, with the extrusion and
rolling facilities now in commercial pro-
duction on a rising scale, we have it from
the chairman that Alcoa “is now well
placed to take advantage of the strongly
rising demand for the metal”.
Alcoa's experience to date is of general
interest on two particular counts. For one
thing, it helps to explain some observa-
tions and figures in last week’s White
Paper from the Treasury on overseas
investment. For another, it seems rather
relevant to the present behind-the-scenes
play in what has been called “the battle
for Gove”, in which various axis have
lately been busy along Collins Street and
across to 400 Bourke Street.
There seems little doubt that estab-
lishment losses, such as Alcoa’s in the
last three years, have contributed signifi-
cantly to the reduction in the average
rate of earnings on US capital invested
in this country in this period as now
revealed by the Treasury. True, there
could have been expected a sharp drop
after the boom of 1960-61, but the per-
sistence of the lower percentage rate of
earnings for the three years to 1963-64
cannot be explained by that, because of
the general rise in economic activity
since then.
Through the 19505, income payable as
a percentage of total investment in Aus-
tralia from North America was as high
as 22.8 p.c. (1953-54) and as low as
11.7 p.c. (1952-53 a recession year).
However, over the whole period, it
averaged 16.2 p.c. In 1960-61 it was
12.8 p.c., but in the following year it
dropped to 7.8 p.c., rose slightly to 8.2
p.c. in 1962-63 and fell back 7.7 p.c.
last year. This is still considerably
higher than the return on UK invest-
ment which averaged 7.5 p.c. in the
~. . r ,
fifties, but in the last four years only
5.75 p.c., the figure for 1963-64 being
6 j p c
Referring to the drop in undistributed
income (an important component of
foreign “investment” flows) of North
American investment here in 1961-62
and no more than a partial recovery in
the two succeeding years, the Treasury
obliquely recognises this in saying that
it is in part a reflection of a fall in
income payable to the US and Canada
in those years . It adds that it is also
partly explained by the maintenance of
overseas dividends and remittances of
branch profits to those countries. In
ot er words the income payable on US
and Canadian investments here was on
a lower scale but remittances were not
correspondingly reduced.
It may be said in passing that the
Treasury strikes an assuring note about
this. If income payable to North
American investors continues to grow in
the normal manner,” it states, “it might
be expected that undistributed income
would continue to grow. Whether this
trend eventuates will depend, among
other things, on the repercussions on re-
mittance policies of the recent measures
to improve the United States’ balance
of payments. From replies received from
companies in Australia with United
States connections it does not seem that
these companies contemplate changing
their remittance policies appreciably in
response to these measures.”

From Termites to Rodents
Pest protectors raise their guards
Tt would be impossible to assess the
value of pest protection in Australia;
suffice it to say that some £2l to £3
million a year is spent by householders
alone on treatment and protection against
termites, borers, silverfish and so on, and
rodents such as rats and mice.
It is equally impossible to judge what
losses in crops, timber, food and docu-
ments would be sustained were there no
pest protection and control.
The notion of pest control in Austra-
lia, as far as domestic and industrial ap-
plications are concerned, has been popu-
larised only in the last ten or fifteen
years. Agriculturally there has always
been a steadily increasing demand, but
with the growing use of aerial application
far greater protection is being used and
provided.
Although the present drought condi-
tions will have probably caused a drop
in the use of aircraft for pest control
and eradication purposes, it is interesting
to note the total use of aircraft for the
years ended June 1963 and 1964. In
1963 aircraft applied insecticides and
herbicides to a total of 148,135 acres of
pasture and 1,670,978 acres of crops.
“Other types of treatment” (rabbit bait-
ing, etc.) covered 59,132 acres.
By the end of June last year applica-
tions to pasture totalled 152,709 acres,
crops 1,908,903 acres, and “others”
118,589 acres. Figures for later than
June last year are not yet available.
Unfortunately statistics for domestic,
commercial and industrial applications
are not compiled. However, it is a reason-
able assumption, with the current high
level of building activity in all sectors,
that pest control is being used more every
day. For income-producing properties
pest control is tax deductible. For the
home-owner it is a safeguard against
ruination of a valuable investment and
of no small benefit when he decides to
sell his house.
Evidence of this last point was pre-
sented by Mr A. G. Boyle, of H. W.
Powell and Co. Pty Ltd and president of
the United Pest Control Association. He
said pest control companies were re-
ceiving increasing numbers of enquiries
from solicitors who, before exchanging
contracts, wished to ensure a home or
building was not pest-infested or was
being treated.
Differing viewpoints were obtained on
whether the increasing use of concrete
and steel for city buildings was cutting
down on the demand for commercial
pest control. Some companies The
Bulletin spoke to said the commercial
business was being limited by the use of
pest-proof building materials. Others
pointed out that, while the buildings did
not need protection structurally, docu-
ments and furniture in the buildings did.
Another point was that with the high
level of city building, infestations of pests
and rodents were being uncovered by de-
molition. Treatment and eradication be-
cause of these discoveries has meant
slightly more work for at least one pest
control company.
Chemicals used and techniques of ap-
plication in the Australian pest control
industry are equal to the best the world
has to offer. But the industry, like many
others, has to face the problem of un-
scrupulous operators. In pest control not
every householder wishes to part with
money for something he cannot see.
Some smart operators, though, have
talked owners into paying for something
they not only cannot see but which they
have not even received, or which has
been incorrectly or poorly applied.
Mr Boyle-said criticism (some unjusti-
fied or incorrect) of the industry in recent
years had led to the formation of the
United Pest Control Association, “whose
members carry out about 75 p.c. of the
control work done in NSW. The forma-
tion of the Association has given protec-
tion to buyers and some form of redress
where work done is unsatisfactory,” Mr
Boyle said.
The only public company engaged in
pest control is Sydney-based Houghton
and Byrne Holdings Ltd., which offers
industrial, domestic, agricultural and

Do you find that the stocks you are hold-
ing seem to be faring worse than some
you could have had? Why is this? Do
you wish you had sold out at higher
levels, so that you could buy back when
the market takes a turn for the better?
The above questions about the market
have no simple answer, covering all
Stocks. The fact-is that some stocks have
fallen heavily and will continue to do so.
Other stocks have fallen heavily too, but
have bottomed out and are ready to ad-
vance again. A few already haye begun

Trendex is concerned with actual market
movement in stock prices, and not just
with what each stock “should” be doing.
The stocks of good sound companies rise
and fall strongly in the market over a
period of time, just as do those of second
grade companies. Thus, there is a right
and a wrong time to buy 8.H.P., C.S.R.,
Rothmans, and so forth. There is also a
right time and a wrong time to sell them,
One of the basic facts about the Stock
Market is that if you run with the crowd
you won’t make money. Certainly, when
almost all stocks are going up, it is hard
to go wrong in buying. Where people go
Wrong, is in not knowing when to Sell.
Too often, they cling to a stock even
When it falls heavily, comforting them-
selves by saying that eventually it must
go up again. Eventually, it may, too.
How often do you hear a friend say that
when his stock gets back again to what
he paid for it, he will sell out. Possibly
he will, too, some day but that’s not
much of a way to make money,
In the market, the great majority lose
money. To some extent this is bound up
With the fact that a small minority
really make money in big chunks. The
smart thing, then, is to get with that
minority. This means that at important
or critical times in the market you will
be doing the opposite to the majority. To
be sure, when the market is advancing
under full steam, well on its way to-
wards the next big top, the shrewd in-
vestor has been joined by the majority.
However, he leaves them at or near the
top, and liquidates. Right now the major-
ity is disillusioned, licking its wounds
at the bottom of the market, and even
taking the pledge against buying stocks
again. However the shrewd investor,
well cashed up, is buying with great
care to lay the foundations for the next
long winning upward run. He knows
that the front runners next time won’t
be the same as last time. He knows that
the next lot of spectacular performers
will include some of those stocks which
already are stirring and showing signs
of market strength —• although the
majority won’t touch them until they are
at much higher levels. For him the next
hull market has already started.
This method of buying low and selling
high was introduced by Trendex to Aus-
tralian investors in 1961. It was in time
to point out the coming falls in stocks
like B.H.P. and Rothmans (both then
around 80/-). As time went on, we were
able to point out the selling signals for
Drug Houses at 68/-, Lend Lease at
18/11, Frigrite at 17/-, and numerous
others. On the buying side, Trendex has
come up with a long list of successes.
Some of the rises were spectacular, and
scattered among them w r ere stocks
which more than doubled in price in
1963 and 1964. Late last year, Trendex
again was pointing out the warning
signals. When stocks like' Australian
Controls, Burns Philp, Consolidated
Homes, James Hardie, Howard Smith,
Marrickville, Mount Isa, and Pioneer
Sugar topped out, one after the other,
Trendex drew attention to them, and
subscribers sold out. Today, Trendex is
buying stocks again .
Today the market is quiet and dull.
•Further falls are lurking around the
corner. But some stocks are beginning
their forward moves in a quiet way, and
we are pointing them out in Trend ex*.
These aren’t just stocks which have
"fallen too far’', or which ‘‘look cheap”
01* which should he bought to "lock
away". They are stocks which market
analysis shows to possess above average
market strength, and which are actually
going up not just making a rally
before falling further. Will you be buy-
ing them, or will you wait until they
are half way up towards the next top
and have become "popular"?
Not only does Trendex point out coming
falls' and coming rises in a range of
stocks. Week after week, it keeps track
of every stock recommended for Sale#
or purchase until closed out. Moreover,
the background manual supplied to
subscribers shows exactly how the
methods work, and the logic of them,
so that you can apply them for yourself
if you are willing to take the trouble,
Only a minority of investors subscribe
to Trendex, and it will always be that
way, because Trendex subscribers use
their brains, rather than their ears, to
make money in the market, Why nofc
join them?
Ever since publication began in 1961,
Trendex has been calling the tune. When
it was time to sell, Trendex said so. Now
that stocks have fallen, others will tell
you why they fell. Trendex is not con-
cerned with that. Trendex is telling what
stocks to buy again, as the early starters
for the next bull market are beginning
to stir. "The Market" doesn’t recover
precisely on some such day as 17th
June or Bth August. The papers will tell
you that "The Market" is recovering
after a lot of stocks have already moved
up. By that time, many Trendex recom-
mendations will already have made sub-
stantial gains. Trendex points out when
to buy and when to sell while there’s
still time to do it, Trendex is a guide,
not a historian.
Right now, Trendex is the only service to come out and say that the
next bull market has already begun. One by one, certain stocks are
gaining strength and starting to move. Trendex is pointing them out.
By the time the majority agrees that the market is recovering, the
early starters will be almost out of sight. ’Twas ever thus.

have been impossible at a later date “and
the country could have been faced in
the future with timber losses running
into millions of pounds annually.”
Operation Hylo was to remove the
same borer, Hylotrapes bajulus, from
2643 Queensland Housing Commission
dwellings. Houghton and Byrne claims
it to be the largest timber treatment job
ever undertaken in the world. The treat-
ment cost £257,000. Started in January,
1958, and treating 40 homes a week, the
project was not finished until April,
1959.
This is where H. and B. pioneered the
envelope/gas technique. Briefly the house
is totally enclosed in a plastic envelope
and methyl bromide gas released inside.
After three days the houses were declared
gas-free and occupants were allowed to
return. The borers had entered Australia
in imported sections of prefabricated
houses.
Mr Wright said that until recent years
the whole emphasis in domestic pest con-
trol was on white ants and borers.
“There was a great deal of fear of these
pests people thought that unless they
were treated immediately their houses
would fall down around them. But they
are like finding a hole in your tooth. It
doesn't matter whether you go to the
dentist this week or next month. It’s not
going to get appreciably worse but must
eventually be treated.
“The same with white ants and borers.
But the seeds of doubt have been sown
in people’s minds by the less ethical
pest control cdmpanies. Provided the
pests are treated there is no immediate
danger.”
Mr C. E. Taylor, a director of W. A.
Flick and Co. Pty Ltd, one of the
largest pest control companies, said the
acceptance of pest control domestically
in Australia had grown over the last 15
years. “It's just become good housekeep-
ing,” he said. “This does not mean that
other branches of pest control have stag-
nated. They certainly have not. Indus-
trial, commercial and agricultural pest
control is growing too.”
Like most control companies, Flick
operates on an inspection and annual
maintenance basis. On the domestic side,
for instance, once inspection and treat-
ment, if necessary, is completed, for £4
to £5 a year the householder is covered
as long as he pays the annual fee. If fur-
ther treatment is necessary, no charge,
other than the annual fee, is payable by
the householder.
Demand for pest control seems to be
well supplied. In the Sydney Pink Pages
Phone Directory alone there are about
100 pest control operators listed. In-
' eluding branches of bigger companies,
the number would come close to 200.
How long some of the smaller concerns
stay in business is hard to judge. Most
of them have worked for the larger
companies at some time or another and
then set up business on their own.

Educating the New Accountant
From book-keeping to macro-economics
By BRIAN QUINN
public companies crash, just
" how much are the accountants to
blame? Several recent articles have been
both inaccurate and misleading in allo-
cating responsibility in large portion to
accountants for the failure of three
public companies—Reid Murray, Stan-
hill and Latec. Obvious confusion exists
in their writers’ minds between the role
and responsibilities of top management,
executive accountants and auditors. One
article, quoting an unnamed manage-
ment consulting source, suggests that
“accountants are good servants but poor
masters as recent company failures
show”.
It is surely not inappropriate to men-
tion that one quarter of Australian public
company chairmen are in fact account-
ants. Men such as Sir Alexander Fitz-
gerald, J. D. Marks, R. A. Irish, W. and
J. H. Kirkhope, and L. J. Thompson
have made outstanding contributions to
Australian business and have their
origins in the discipline of accountancy.
Despite what some writers appear to
believe, the accounting profession has
made great strides in the last decade.
One of the most striking features of
the accountancy profession is the degree
of administrative rationalisation that has
occurred. In the early ’sos there were
at least three secretarial bodies (admitting
qualified accountants and those who also
had passed company secretarial examina-
tions) and four major accountancy bodies
(the Institute of Chartered Accountants
in Australia, the Federal Institute, the
Commonwealth Institute and the Aus-
tralasian Institute of Cost Accountants).
Today the seven bodies have been re-
duced to virtually three significant
societies only—the Chartered Institute
of Secretaries, the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in Australia and the Aus-
tralian Society of Accountants. The
Australasian Institute of Cost Account-
ants tends to operate as the post-graduate
body of the Australian Society of Ac-
countants, with which it is now affiliated.
Approximately 30,000 members are ad-
ministered by these professional bodies.
and joint consultation
between the bodies is continuous;
much of this has been brought about by
the tendency for rationalisation and the
recent legislation on many aspects of
accounting and company law.
The educational requirements for
accountancy have recently been surveyed
by both the Martin Committee and Pro-
fessor William Vatter, Ph.D, CPA,
FASA, Professor of Business Administra-
tion, University of California. The latter
study was sponsored by the accountancy
bodies —the Institute of Chartered Ac-
countants in Australia, most of whose
members are in public practice; the Aus-
tralian Society of Accountants, most of
whose members hold commercial ap-
pointments, and the Australasian In-
stitute of Cost Accountants, whose mem-
bers tend to specialise in management
accounting. A great degree of agreement
is shown in the findings of the Martin
report and those of Professor Vatter.
The sponsorship of the Vatter study
indicates the seriousness with which the
profession’s leaders regard the educa-
tional requirements for future account-
ants. Accountancy is already one of the
main specialisations of tertiary students
in Australia. It is estimated that 35 p.c.
of the 6000 commerce and economics
students major in accounting. Commerce
and economics faculties in Australian
universities represent about 12 p.c. of
total enrolments and are one of the
fastest-growing student groups. In ad-
dition to university enrolments it is
estimated that over 1000 other students
are studying accountancy at technical
schools, through private coaching col-
leges, by correspondence or through
personal and private tuition methods.
The main recommendation of the
Vatter report when implemented will have
the effect of diverting all those who

qualify to study accountancy to tertiary
institutions. Thus the Vatter report has
some important implications for tertiary
education planning in Australia, an area
presently receiving considerable publicity.
Another fundamental change which
is recommended is that every accountant
will in future have had two years’ full-
time educational training at a tertiary
institution, with two years’ additional
part-time study. Since university en-
trance standards are to be the prerequisite
for commencing study, the new basic pro-
gramme corresponds to a three-year full-
time university degree. However, the
subjects recommended are very different
from the present examination syllabi of
the professional bodies. Professional
membership will be granted only after
successfully completing four years’ study.
Further studies of up to two years in
particular specialisations, such as audit-
ing, accounting systems design and sec-
retarial practice, will be required for
recognition of competence in these areas.
Professor Vatter thus recommends
moving much of. the present technical
accounting procedures to the later
optional specialist level. Much of the
law content is also removed from the
basic core course. These subjects are to
be replaced by management accounting
and financial planning and control (the
existing post-graduate subjects ad-
ministered by the Cost Institute), to-
gether with a heavy injection of social
sciences, economic analysis and statistics
(all of which are already available in
'Economics/Commerce degrees).
accountants will thus have a
broader education emphasising, as
well as management accounting, the
social and economic environment in
which the accountant works. Subjects
recommended for inclusion in the new
basic degree are psychology, political
science, statistics, basic accounting
measurements, electronic data processing,
some basic law, financial control, manage-
ment accounting, mathematical models,
financial planning, organisational theory
and income measurement. A revolution
indeed.
In shaping an educational programme
for the future it was necessary to deter-
mine the areas in which accountants
thought there was likely to be a heavier
work emphasis. The results of this
study indicate that, whereas accountants
expect much of the detailed “hack”
financial and general accounting to be
delegated to subordinates or machines,
they expect special studies for manage-
ment, data processing and cost account-
ing to increase in importance. The
academic disciplines related to each of
these areas may be included in the basic
course. The techniques will be covered
later.
A survey of accounting teachers and
lecturers at the tertiaiiy level indicated
which non-accounting subjects should be
included in a general accounting degree.
The clear leaders here were English,
mathematics, macro - economics, psy-
chology and logic. The same academic
group was requested to state the relative
importance of the various accountancy
subjects and the general area “manage-
ment controls” was first choice.
THhe key sections of the Martin report
A dealing with accountancy education
state: “. . . the best educational prepara-
tion for accountancy . . . consists of
broadly-based programmes of the kind
provided by the universities in their
Bachelor of Economics or Commerce
degrees, followed by specialised pro-
fessional training at the post-graduate
level . . . There are special advantages
to be gained from superimposing the
professional training of accountants upon
analytical courses of the kind provided
by universities . . .”. In its submission
to the Martin Committee, the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in Australia
saw “considerable advantages in a system
which depended on university education
as a pre-requisite for qualifying examina-
tions at a professional level”.
The Martin report thus concludes in
a vein similar to Professor Vatter: “Pro-
fessional work could be undertaken in
a period of post-graduate study, at an
advanced technological institution or at
a university, and would lead to a pro-
fessional rather than to an academic
qualification.” In other words, the tech-
niques required for professional com-
petence should be learned only after a
broad educational programme concerned
with social sciences and academic dis-
cipline has been satisfactorily completed.
Some accountancy subjects meet the
criteria of university subjects since they
are closely related to the social sciences
already taught and “comprise a mental
discipline . . . which constitutes an
intellectual challenge to the enquiring
mind, and an introduction to the method
and instrument of analysis . . .”
Both the Martin and Vatter reports are
the result of extensive research. The
professional bodies, accountants, teach-
ers, top executives, and recent graduates
combined to provide much background
data. A compelling and exciting concept
has been the result. The accountant of
1975 will indeed require and it is hoped
will have enjoyed a more sophisticated
education, so as to be able to increase
his potential contribution to society. The
winds of change that began with the
rationalisation of the profession seem
now likely to blow through the whole
educational structure of accountancy.

Capital Gains Fly Away
But better years for Ansett Transport
one-for-ten par issue announced by
Ansett Transport Industries last
week would appear to herald the end of
any notably capital benefits from the
group for some time to come. The ratio
speaks for itself previous issues were
one-for-five in 1959-60 and 1961-62 and
a one-for-six in 1962-63, all three at par.
Compared with these issues, the latest
will provide only a paltry few shillings
for the pockets of shareholders and con-
vertible noteholders. Capital of the group
has now reached the level where generous
issues cannot be made for fear of deci-
mating the earning rate and only small
issues need be made, anyway, to raise
cash.
The time gap between this and the last
issue has also indicated that the days of
sizeable capital benefits are over for now.
Shareholders had not been called upon
despite the rapid expansion and the
spending of more money than ever be-
fore. They have seen new planes, a tele-
vision station (ATV-0) and the inevitable
swing toward loan capital.
In fact, lan Potter & Co., underwriters
with the AUC group to the share issue,
have only recently underwritten and
handled Ansett’s most recent debenture
issue. This firm of stockbrokers would •
know as much about the group as any-
one. Only days before the issue an-
nouncement, a circular was posted t o
clients highlighting the bright future of
the group and estimating profits for the
current year in the light of the initial
losses by the television subsidiary. Nice
timing, to say the least.
The circular says the £BOO,OOO profit
in the December half represented only a
small increase but was after higher tax
and five months’ television losses. The
firm estimated that these losses totalled
£240,000 in the half on the strength
of the company’s estimate of a £352,000
loss in the first year, the fact that most
of this would be incurred in the first
half and the fact that losses so far have
been reported heavier than expected. For
the current half, Potters expect a loss of
£150,000, making £390,000 in all for the
full year.
In the event, the television subsidiary,
Austarama Television Pty Ltd, incurred
trading losses totalling £193,188 for its
December half-year.
“Assuming a £240,000 television loss,
the profit on the other sectors would have
been £1,040,000 for the first half,” Pot-
ters argued. “A further improvement of,
say, seven p.c. in the second half-year
seems a fair estimate in view of past per-
formances and present prospects. This
would give a 1964-65 profit of
£2,143,000 after tax. Deducting the tele-
vision loss, group profit becomes
£1,753,000 and, after paying preference
dividends, this would be equal to an earn-
ing rate of 20 p.c. on ordinary capital.”
On the strength of these figures from
Potters, one can see that earning rates
will actually rise on the higher capital
once ATV starts to do its bit. Therefore,
there is no doubt that the present 10 p.c.
dividend will be continued.
The Grocery War
>T-he war in groceries leans heavily to
the bulk buyer who can handle large
quantities. The highest grocery discounts
go to retail chains which can afford and
can handle a truckload or trainload of
deliveries into a central warehouse.

warehouse facilities is exemplified by a
recent report from Franklin’s Pty Ltd,
which claims to be Sydney’s third largest
food chain. It is building a 70,000 sq. ft
warehouse at Lidcombe, NSW, but says
it could be selling £20,000 a week more
of groceries through its 62 branches if
it didn’t have to cope with its present
distribution bottleneck at warehouse
level.
Despite paying overtime to cope with
the distribution of grocery lines, the
company claims that the necessity to
stock a wider range of goods is putting
a big strain on distributing facilities.
Franklin’s claims that new grocery-food
products are being launched on the
market at the rate of more than 50 a
week which, with the build-up of existing
stocks, provides a distributor’s night-
mare. For example, toilet tissues are
being marketed in a variety of colors
and instant coffee is being distributed in
three sizes instead of the old 2 oz. size.
So, if the electrical retailers have bad
debt problems, the retail grocers are
coming up against warehousing and dis-
tributing problems.
Sugar Trends
A further contribution to widely
varying sugar company reports
comes from Moreton Central Sugar Mill
Co. Ltd. Moreton’s profit eased 5.8 p.c.
or £6479 from the 1963 boom year level
of £111,896 to £105,417.
This result compares with falls in
.Gibson and Howes (62 p.c.), Plane
Creek Central Mills (24 p.c.), Pioneer
Sugar (48.5 p.c.) and Fairymead (2.3
p.c.). Moreton’s earning rate for
the latest year (ended December 31) is
20.6 p.c. compared with 1963’s 36.5 p.c.
Partly the cause of the earning rate
drop is a two-for-three bonus issue
during the year. As forecast at the time
of the issue, dividend goes from 16 p.c.
to 12 p.c. Tax on the latest profit is
£68,200 (down £39,800) and depreciation
£52,037 (an increase of £5397).
In their preliminary report directors
add that the company’s 20s. shares will
be split into 10s. units.
Loose Stitches
explanation is warranted from
Maryborough Knitting Mills (Cuttle)
Ltd, the group that took over the ailing
La Mode companies last year. Directors
have reported that profit in the year to
March 31 fell from £50,000 to £38,000.
They add that La Mode, now a wholly-
owned subsidiary, made a £106,000 loss
in the nine months to balance date, but

do not make clear exactly how much (if
any) of this loss has been consolidated
into the group result.
Nevertheless, certain facts are obvious.
All of the loss has not been consolidated,
otherwise the group would be left with
no profits at all. In addition, the future
looks very dim unless La Mode can be
pulled out of the hopeless pickle it ap-
pears to be in. The main subsidiary is
under receivership, so the future is in-
definite. Perhaps on the grounds of this
situation directors decided not to con-
solidate any of the loss at all. If such
was the case, the latest profit fall must
be viewed seriously. Clarification should
come with the annual report at the very
latest.
Despite the setback, the year’s divi-
dend is to be maintained at the usual
121 p.c. The cover, however, is uncom-
fortably narrow, as earning rate on
higher capital comes out at only 13.3 p.c.
This is well down from 20.3 p.c. last
year when profit rose to a five-year peak.
Future Exploration
Shareholders await with interest the
details of Metals Exploration’s future
plans. Directors promised that these
would be announced “soon” when they
released the news of a one-for-two issue
recently. The cash raised will be used to
finance these undetailed forward commit-
ments. It’s sincerely to be hoped that
“soon” is before June 10 books close
for entitlements that day and rights
trading will start the following day. It
would be unfair to keep shareholders in
the dark during rights trading, possibly at
the mercy of that notorious fellow the
speculator. At the time of going to press,
nothing had been heard from the com-
pany although such may not be the case
by the time this edition reaches the
streets.
In the meantime, it is sufficient to
point out that these future plans will
need to be pretty impressive in the light
of the higher capital which the profits
will now have to service each year. The
recent takeover of Australian Placer, and
now the share issue, involve the creation
of well over two million new shares. In
addition, 350,000-odd shares have been
placed, with Freeport Sulphur, to raise
further cash and to allow that company
to maintain its equity interest in Metals.
Under an agreement between the two,
this cannot fall below a certain percent-
age; after all these recent moves it will
stand at a little more than 27 p.c. In
total, more than two-and-a-half million
new shares are to be issued by Metals.
Shareholders have already had some
inkling as to what the future holds. At
the time of the Australian Placer take-

over, it was stated that the group’s total
known reserves of payable tin-bearing
ground had been increased to between
three and four million yards. Based on
these, the present plant could operate
for four years and provide a substantial
source of revenue. Further exploration
in the meantime could disclose other re-
serves which would prolong the life of
operations.
On the basis of these statements, it
can be assumed that the future plans will
embrace both a definite schedule for the
treatment of these reserves and a certain
amount of expenditure on exploration.
Although it may be too much to ask, it
would be a valuable guide if directors
could see their way clear to estimate
profits over the next few years on the
basis of a certain tin price. As things
stand now, substantial revenue is ex-
pected, yet shareholders have little idea
of how adequately it will service the
substantially higher capital.
Surprise 10
The prospectus from Vandenbrink In-
A dustries, to be listed in Melbourne,
provided a nice little surprise for the
clients of G. E. Carrington and Co.,
members of the Stock Exchange and
underwriters to the issue. Dividends of
10 p.c. are predicted by directors of the
wrought iron product manufacturer and
electroplater. Prior to the release of the
prospectus it was thought that only a
9 p.c. prediction would be ventured.
The issue will undoubtedly be sought
with keenness. Only 224,000 shares are

expectation of 240,000. Moreover, they
will be issued at ss. 6d. a very small

The 10 p.c. dividend should be well
covered. Up to March 31, profits equalled
18.5 p.c. on post-issue capital on an an-
nual basis. Directors expect the result
for the full year to turn in an earning
rate of 17.5 p.c.

an audited loss of £199,478 in the six
months to January 30, after writing off
£257,702 for bad debts. It charged
£102,093 of these against provisions.
Net bad debt charge was thus
£155,609, resulting in a trading loss of
£43,869 for the six months. In the

after writing off £245,708 for bad debts.
In the latest halt year directors have
provided an extra £126,557 for doubtful
debts by a transfer from the assets
revaluation reserve.
The latest provision is made on debts
on which no payment has been received
for six months or longer. Depreciation
provision for the latest half year is
£83,830 compared with a total of
£122,662 for the previous full year.
Directors say they have increased the
rate of depreciation on shop fittings and
fixtures from five to 10 p.c.
Sales for the latest six months reached
£5.1 million. For the last whole year
they totalled £lO.l million. However,
the latest sales figure includes Christmas
trading. Income from financing credit
sales stands at £385,285. Long-term
financing is now being handled by an
outside finance group.
Directors have already forecast a loss
for the current year but expect an im-
provement next year. Marcus Clark’s ss.
shares are now dowm to 25., their lowest
point this year. At one stage they were
priced at 4s. 4d.—their highest level for
1965.
Sweet Issues
11/Telbourne-based confectionery group
1 ** Allen Holdings has certainly caused
a stir in the trade over the last few weeks.
The old-established Griffiths Sweets
group wasi taken over for an undisclosed
amount of cash and directors have made
no secret about the substantial expansion
which they have planned for the new
subsidiary. Productive capacity is to be
increased and a vigorous plan of Austra-
lia-wide marketing is apparently already
beyond the drawing-board stage.
Shareholders were quite expecting a
cash issue to finance all these plans. Al-
though the holding company has never
asked them for cash since it was formed
in 1954-55, it has made two one-for-four
bonus issues and gradually lifted divi-
dends from 10 p.c. to 16 p.c. However,
directors have informed them that the
£200,000-odd needed will be generated
internally and instead they have decided
to make another bonus issue. This time
it will be a one-for-three.
'Moreover, directors expect that last
year’s 16 p.c. dividend will only be cut to
124 p.c. on the increased capital. In
effect, this means that shareholders will
be collecting a lGf p.c. dividend on the
old capital. So they will be getting the
benefits of a dividend increase as W'ell as
a bonus share issue.
The rest of the trade is currently pre-
paring itself for battle. Allen directors
have quite a task ahead of them but, on
past performance, they seem likely to
come through with flying colours. They
will need to do just this if the proposed
dividend on the new capital is to be de-
cently covered. Last year's profit equalled
24 p.c. on capital. On post-bonus capital
it would equal 18 p.c. Profit increases are
needed to boost this and leave enough
over after the dividend to transfer to
reserves so that the company can main-
tain its record as a bonus-issuer in the
years to come.

the Balance Sheets” on page 75.]

S ECURITYANALYSIS
In Favor of the Queensland Insurance
A comparison with Mercantile Mutual
Tn common with the other insurance
A companies, the price of the ordinary
shares of the Queensland Insurance Co.
Ltd have been marked down this year
and at the time of writing they are
selling at precisely the same price, 745.,
as those of the Mercantile. This similar
pricing is a fairly long-term phenomenon,
as can be seen from the dividend yields
that have been available from the last
sale price in the month when the
accounts have been presented over the
last five years:
Year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Mercantile 2.8 2.4 2.5 2.2 3.0
Queensland 2.9 2.3(a) 2.5 2.2 3.0
(a) Based on the p.c. rate and ignoring the
5 p.c. bonus.
It will be interesting to compare these
two companies and to try to decide
whether this similarity is justified.
In the first instance, it is worth noting
that, in theory, the shares of the Queens-
land should be higher priced than the
Mercantile if the usual criterion of earn-
ings yields or price/earnings ratios were
applied. For reasons given in the article
on the Mercantile (The Bulletin, June
5), the appropriate figure for an insur-
ance company is the investment income.
When expressed as a percentage of
ordinary capital for these two com-
panies the following series appear:
Year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Mercantile 13.7 13.9 16.4 18.9 18.2
Queensland 19.3 20.0 22.1 20.0 21.7
Although, at the present time, it would
seem that the potential for future divi-
dend increases is greater so far as the
Queensland is concerned, it is also im-
portant to examine the past performance
of the investment portfolios. In the
article on the Mercantile Mutual, it was
pointed out that the present return on
the average funds invested had increased
by just over 30 p.c. in the last ten years
and the increase had been fairly steady
apart from the period from July 1, 1959,
to June 30, 1961. Furthermore, the
current rate of return on investment
funds, including freehold property, was
3.8 p.c. Unfortunately, directly compar-
able figures are not available to me, but
from 1958 the rate of return on the
Mercantile Mutual’s funds has increased
by 18.8 p.c., while the rate of return
on the Queensland’s funds has increased
by 22.9 p.c. and is now 4.3 p.c.
Looking through the brief directors’
reports of the five years and carefully
examining the various notes to the
accounts where these occur, the follow-
ing increases would appear to have
occurred without the generation of re-
tained revenue during the period:
(i) The directors’ report of 1960 in-
dicates that in that year assets were
valued in Australian currency for the
first time and, as a result, a net increase
in assets of £500,000 occurred.
(ii) The footnotes to the balance sheet
for the 1961 year suggest that a further
increase of £200,000 arose from trans-
fers from “provisions which are no longer
considered necessary.”
(iii) An amount of £500,000 was
capitalised from the revaluation of assets
reserve account to make a bonus issue
during the 1962-63 year. It would seem
that shares, debentures and notes in
listed companies were partly revalued for
this purpose.
The increase in the investment port-
folio therefore seems to have arisen from
the following sources:
£ million
Underwriting surplus (including increase in
unexpired risk reserve) 1.5
Investment income surplus 1.0
Increase in claims, creditors, etc 0.7
Revaluation of assets 1.3
The total increase in the Queensland’s
portfolio appears to be much lower than
in the case of the Mercantile Mutual’s,
but the Queensland is ploughing back
a much higher proportion of its invest-
ment income—3s.l p.c. as against the
Mercantile Mutual’s 25.9 p.c. Another
factor which seems to favor the Queens-
land is the steady nature of under-
writing profit. Over the five-year period
which we have been considering the
trend of the two companies has been
as follows:
Index 1960 =lOO
Year 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Mercantile 100 72 41 91 23
Queensland 100 87 99 97 122
Points in favor of Mercantile Mutual
are that, first, the investment portfolio
has been increasing at a much greater
rate than that of the Queensland because
of a much more rapid build-up in under-
writing profits and factors allied thereto,
such as the unexpired risk reserve and
claims outstanding, etc. Secondly, the
Mercantile Mutual has a substantial in-
vestment in life assurance, which seems
to be much greater than that of the
Queensland..
Personally, I believe that the factors
in favor of the Queensland tend to out-
weigh those in favor of the Mercantile
Mutual, but I would find it hard to give
any quantitative assessment other than
that mentioned earlier.
I would consider that the Queensland's
shares should be priced about 10 p.c.
above those of the Mercantile Mutual to
allow for the greater dividend cover and
the higher rate of return which has been
consistently earned on the investment
portfolio.

Is there a CRANE in your refrigerator?
Instead of the labyrinth of tubing which used
to be in your refrigerator, these days you’ll
more than likely find a Crane evaporator
plate. This is a result of much research and
planning by Crane Copper & Aluminium Pty.
Ltd., just one of the companies in the G. E.
Crane Group. Crane Copper & Aluminium
Pty. Ltd. also supplies aluminium, brass and
copper in flat sheets, rolls, coils, ex-
trusions, strips, etc. to companies who
turn it into such items as saucepans, kitchen
furniture, kettles, milk bottle tops, hundreds
of things we see and use in everyday life.
Other companies in the group aid a diversity
of Australian industries, too. G. E. Crane Pty.
Ltd. supply all kinds of brassware to the
plumbing trade, and Crane Products Pty. Ltd.
manufactures building sheet in five profiles.
Crane Enfield Metals supply a large share
of Australia’s copper tube and aluminium
extrusion requirements and also manufacture
aluminium tube.
In fact if you have any problem involving
aluminium, brass or copper for saucepans,
salt shakers or even ships, it’s almost certain
that Crane's will have the answer.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Feel Them Doing Good
Generosity from Allen Holdings
rpHE manufacturing and wholesale con-
fectionery business of Melbourne-
based and listed Allen Holdings Ltd can
trace its origin back to 1920. Today’s
holding company came into existence in
May, 1955, when it was formed to take
over the existing business of A. W. Allen
Ltd. It did this by offering the share-
holders three ss. shares for every one
share they held. Since that year the group
has shown healthy overall growth and a
marked generosity to shareholders.
The listed holding company at present
controls three subsidiaries, A. W. Allen
Ltd, the manufacturing offshoot; A. W.
Allen Sales Pty Ltd, the distributing
rffshoot, and Griffiths Sweets Pty Ltd.
Griffiths was only acquired (for an un-
disclosed cash amount) in April. It has
yet to be integrated into the group. The
Mien directors have bold plans for their
lew venture production facilities are
o be expanded and a mass marketing as-
.ault is to be launched on an Australia-
jvide basis.
The immediate plans for Griffiths will
nvolve a capital investment of £200,000.
dowever, shareholders will not be called
>n to provide any of this. The highly
iquid position of the group (despite the
:ash acquisition) will enable the finance
o be generated internally.
Griffiths’ production covers a fairly
vide range of brands. The best-known
vould probably be those eternal Kool
dints. The Allen range is, of course, very
xtensive. Some of the following should
ing a bell: Steam Rollers, Fruit Tingles,
\nticol, Cheers, Butter Menthols, Pop-
iettes, Coconut Quivers, QTs, Mint
dinors and Irish Moss Medicated Jubes
“you can feel them doing you good”).
The same advertising slogan could also
escribe the effect which the group’s
, hares have had on shareholders’ port-
olios over the years. Since the holding
ompany was formed there have been
vo one-for-four bonus issues, one in
1956-57 and the other in 1959-60. Both
followed asset revaluations. At the same
time, dividends have been rising. The
original 10 p.c. rate was up to 15 p.c. in
1958-59. The issues and the credit
squeeze cut the rate back to 131 p.c.,
but in 1962-63 it was back to 15 p.c. and
last year it touched a peak of 16 p.c.
This rate should be maintained in the
current year. Interim dividend was held
steady after “satisfactory” profit in-
creases in the December half-year.
Earning rate also touched a peak
24 p.c. last year after record profits. The
previous peak was 23.9 p.c. in 1958-59.
It fell to a low of 15.8 p.c. in 1960-61.
However, as the accompanying table
shows, dividends were generous in rela-
tion to earnings over the “squeeze” years.
As a result, the shares never came re-
motely close to par ss. over the entire
period. In fact, the lowest price was
13s. 3d. in the 1962 calendar year.
Prior to the formation of the holding
company, shareholders enjoyed benefits
which were also of high calibre. Dividend
was 2s. in 1949-50 before the one-for-one
bonus issue and share split (from 20s. to
55.) necessitated reductions. From 1950-
51 to 1953-54 inclusive, the dividend on
the ss. shares rose from 7ld. to Is. and
earning rate jumped from 26.6 p.c. to
56.2 p.c. Such high rates were, of course,
reduced by the formation of the holding
company. This hardly affected share-
holders, though, as the 1955 move gave
them a virtual three-for-one bonus. On
their new holding, dividend for each 100
shares originally held rose from £5 to
£7 10s.
This practice of raising effective divi-
dends where possible after an issue looks
like continuing. Last month, shareholders
were informed of another bonus issue,
this time a one-for-three. Directors ex-
pect that the present 16 p.c. dividend
will be reduced to 124 p.c. on the higher
capital (up from £724,000 to £966,000).
Calculated on original capital, share-
holders will actually be receiving a divi-
dend of 16f p.c. Again the issue is being
made from a revaluation of assets. The
shares held in A. W. Allen are being
boosted in worth by £242,000.
This latest move illustrates very
strongly the company’s generosity to
shareholders. It could have easily made
a par issue of the same ratio, using the
£242,000 raised to spend on Griffiths.
This would have maintained liquidity at

.very high levels and still enabled a sub-
stantial boost to reserves from the revalu-
ation. Instead, directors hand out free
shares and raise the necessary cash
internally. Shareholders are indeed hav-
ing their cake and eating it too.
Nevertheless, the group is one of the
few which can afford to do this. On the
new capital, last year’s profit would equal
18 p.c., ample cover for the 12i p.c.
dividend. Of course, the ploughback to
reserves will be greatly reduced so there
may be another five-year wait before the
next bonus issue. But gradually rising
profits and the successful expansion of
Griffiths will be boosting overall profits
to much higher levels by 1966-67.
In the meantime, there is a possibility
that a cash issue could be made to finance
any general expansion. This goes on all
the time — last year £68,000 was spent
on new manufacturing and packaging
equipment. Also land was bought at
Geelong for the erection of a distribution
depot. At Waverley, 12 acres of land
were acquired last year to “accommodate
possible future factory requirements.”
The subsequent acquisition of Griffiths
will hasten any move which will even-
tually be made to set up a factory at
Waverley, but the date of such a move is
at present unforeseeable.
In the accompanying table, the overall
increase in current assets, set against only
steady current liabilities, provided high
working capital at June 30 last year.
More than £200,000 of this was in short-
term investments and bonds, all of which
will be absorbed by the Griffiths moves.
The complete absence of loan capital
shows the extensive capacity still existing
for expansion. Fixed assets have grown
slowly overall, while intangibles (good-
will orf consolidation) are possibly a
little high and have yet to be reduced.
Ordinary and preference capital have
been steady and reserves have increased
their margin over the former.

figures illustrate the aforementioned
generosity. Dividend yields have always
offered reasonable returns, having regard
to the capital benefits always inherent in
the stock. The high share price history is
market evidence of the capital benefits-
increasing dividends combination.
To sum up: the Griffiths acquisition
and the current bonus issue have re-
moved any of the stock’s short-term
attractiveness. Yet, the long-term now
holds great promise. Growth in the in-
dustry has slowed over recent years, but
Allen’s should pick up now that Griffiths
is to be integrated, expanded, etc. Long-
term benefits will, of course, be higher
dividends and more issues, as in the past,
As these now depend heavily on Grif-
fiths’ success, a close eye should be kept
on the progress of the plans in hand.
Any buying should now be left until the
shares are ex-bonus, when rights trading
and the current uninspired state of share
markets could combine to provide a most
attractive means of entry into a sweet
future.

Straightening Out Bad Debts
But it's still bully for tin
With company losses in the past few
"" years now £73 million-odd, much
of it due to bad debts, Associated Securi-
ties surely deserves some sort of award
for its current ad. It asks, a trifle boldly
I thought, ’’Why spend your money when
you can spend ours?” Just what H. G.
Palmer’s customers have been doing for
years, apparently.
Seriously, though, it’s a wonder to me
that someone responsible hasn’t suggest-
ed a Royal Commission or some form of
public inquiry into the operation of fin-
ance companies, credit retailers, and the
like. Losses of £73 million can hardly be
brushed aside. They must surely mean
that the last five or six years will go
down as the most lamentable period in
the history of Australian company man-
agement. Surely an inquiry of some kind
can only be of benefit to the industries
concerned as well as to the investing
public in the hope that a continuation of
these losses can be stopped.
I realise this is none of my business.
But I do hope it is going to be made
someone’s business to get things straight
again.
Back now to the market, where it is
still bully for tin, only more so. With
profits hard to come by these days, I’m
more than grateful to Tableland Tin
whose shares (at time of writing) had
appreciated by 50 p.c. in the last three
months and by 33 p.c. since I bought in
March at 335. 7id. The temptation to
sell at 455. was too great so I let 200
go, but decided to hold on to the other
200 in the greedy hope of still better
things.
My next transaction was to buy back
the 200 Fairymead I’d sold short at 245.,
cum a sevenpenny dividend. I bought
these back at 225., for a very small pro-
fit of £5. Fairymead and other sugar
stocks may well go lower yet, but I’d
been short two weeks which is dan-
gerously long in a fairly lightly traded
stock like Fairymead.
Incidentally, it was intriguing to read
in the chairman’s address that Fairy-
mead’s profit is really no more than an
estimate. If that is so, why bother de-
daring the latest profit so precisely at
£397,346?
When it came to buying this week, I
passed over the listed companies and
decided it was time I had a look at the
prospectuses for some recent and current
floats. An interesting set of documents
if ever there were. I was able to get
my hands on the prospectuses for George
Weston, Mr Whippy, Eglo Engineering,
Vickers (engineering, not gin), and Nutt
and Muddle.
The fascinating figure in these pros-
pectuses was not the issue price (stiff in
most cases) or the earning rate (poor in
several instances), but undoubtedly the
cash consideration to the vendors. In the
Mr Whippy issue, for instance, the ven-
dors pick up £680,000 in cash plus
3,680,000 shares. The Nutt and Muddle
vendors scored a respectable £367,500
(plus 2,600,000 shares). And so it goes on.
The upshot of all this is that goodwill
features pretty prominently among these
companies’ assets. George Weston boasts
goodwill of £3.2 million, Mr. Whippy
£1 million, Nutt and Muddle £650,000
(written off, however, against the share
premium reserve arising from the issue),
and Eglo £115,000.
Large amounts of goodwill, of course,
mean low backing in terms of net tan-
gible assets. This is how the figures come
out for these five issues:
Par Issue Asset
Value Price Backing
. , s. d. s. d. s. d.
Nutt and Muddle 2 0 5 3 2 0
Mr Whippy 5 0 7 6 2 8
George Weston 5 0 8 6 3 8
Eglo Eng. 5 0 5 0 2 6
Vickers 10 0 17 6 12 10£
I have refrained from using exclama-
tion marks in the above table. Discussing
goodwill with an accountant friend, he
drily remarked, “Seems to be creeping
in again, doesn’t it?”
Despite this I felt I should subscribe
to at least one of these issues. The Eglo
and Weston issues were already being
traded (at ss. 6d. and Bs. lid. respective-
ly), so my choice was confined to the
other three. The decision wasn’t easy,
but I finally came down on the side of
Nutt and Muddle, the poker machine
people.
While I don’t like any company that
uses the 2s. share tactic, the prospect of a
40 p.c. earning rate was rather engaging.
Furthermore, there was the thought of
the profits that will no doubt be made in
helping all those dear old fruit machines
accommodate decimal coins which is
no doubt why Mr Renshaw was so con-
fidently able to promise to abolish the 2s.
machines. They’ll go with decimal cur-
rency, anyhow.
I thought it best to refer the ques-
tion of Nutt and Muddle to my friend
J. B. who had already consulted his re-
gular panel of brokers and a taxi-
driver as well. On his advice I applied for
500.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
The Search for Unity
Broader views among farmers
By A. F. HAVARD
President, National Farmers’ Union of Australia
T\isunity and dissension among farmer
” organisations in Australia have been
with us for so long, I imagine, that they
are almost accepted as part of the
natural order of things. At last, I believe,
there are signs that much of this could
be past.
Since the late 19505, a small band of
enthusiasts from several organisations
have worked at consolidating the
National Farmers’ Union (itself a federa-
tion of 70 different bodies) and, in co-
operation with the Australian Primary
Producers’ Union, in bringing about a
combining of the two organisations at
the Federal level. A maximum of
patience has been required to get the
message across and to break through
“pride and prejudice” of commodity
organisations, the majority of which are
now members of NFU. Little by little
these organisations are taking the
broader view. By “they” I mean the body
of management in each organisation,
because I feel that the large majority of
rank-and-file farmers accept the principle
of unity, although no doubt many are
vague about the form which it should
take.
One has to be aware of the difference
in the two main types of unity which
the NFU and the APPU represent, and
to ask oneself how far these are practic-
able for the Australian situation. The
NFU is really a federation of organisa-
tions, while the APPU is one big union
of individual farmers. I do not think it
is realistic at the present time to expect
autonomous, powerful and efficient com-
modity organisations to disappear from
the scene, nor do I think it desirable.
Their place would need to be taken by
specialist commodity committees which
would also need to be autonomous, as
far as possible, in their own field.
I do not believe that the NFU of
England and Wales or the Federated
Farmers of New Zealand (and I have had
close contact with both on their own
ground) can be taken as examples of
what would suit Australia. Certainly
they have many management features
which we could do well to emulate.
TT . . ,
However, Australian primary industry
possesses a variety of specialised but
differing productive activities, and it is
not possible for vegetable growers, pro-
ducing for the home market, to agree
on everything with, for example, wool
growers who produce primarily for the
export market. In England and Wales,
the home market is largely the only
market which any farmers are concerned
about.
The form of unity, which we hope
soon to achieve, will begin with building
an overall general-purpose organisation.
It is important in this field to build
slowly but surely. It is both easy and
useless to build something that could
fall apart when the first cold wind of
adversity begins to blow. This has
happened in the past at both State and
Federal level far too often. Thus, it is
a matter of giving organisations and
individual people time to consolidate
their thinking after each forward step.
This has, I believe, been the story of

the National Farmers’ Union, which, in
1958-59, after being what I would
regard as more or less dormant, was
stirred for the first time since its in-
ception in the mid 19405, during the
visit of the English NFU president, Mr
James Turner, now Lord Netherthorpe.
For a long time its activities were able
to be conducted by part-time staff, re-
imbursed with honoraria, plus the
annual subscription of £l3OO to the
International Federation of Agricultural
Producers. Then for a time this sub-
scription was borne by only three out of
the then eight-member organisation. One
delegate per year attended the IFAP
Conference until 1963, when five Aus-
tralian observers from various boards
and organisations attended, at their own
expense. Fortunately, I was able to
attend as an observer, on finance pro-
vided by the Commonwealth Govern-
ment, in order to report on the effective-
ness of IFAP, since the NFU had been
obliged to withdraw from membership
the previous year, thanks to the great
burden of cost still being left to only
three organisations. However, during
1959, major steps had been taken, such
as the appointment of a full-time sec-
retary with stenographer, with a very
much increased budget, to strengthen
NFU.
The present position with the APPU
is most significant. Discussions com-
menced on a regular basis in 1960 and
have now reached a stage where very
little prevents us from achieving the
goal of both organisations working to-
gether on non-commodity matters under
the common name of the Australian
Farmers’ Federation. The agreement
provides for the name NFU disappear-
ing, while the APPU still retains its
identity in commodity matters and joins
the new AFF, together with the 16-
member organisations of the NFU, in
questions of common concern. Over
recent years, a great number of matters
of difference have been settled to the
point where both organisations have
accepted the AFF draft constitution sub-
ject to one or two specific matters for
further agreement. So far as the NFU
is concerned, the main question to be
settled is the method of financing and
the amount of the proposed per capita
fee to form the basis of subscription paid
by the member organisations to the AFF.
Naturally it is important that a national
body of this composition and size should
have sufficient finance for an effective
secretariat based in Canberra, working
in closest co-operation with farmer
organisations throughout the Common-
wealth.
It is to be hoped that the first stage
of the Australian Farmers’ Federation
can be reached this year, since both
organisations will have their annual con-
ferences in Canberra in October/Novem-
ber. Such a move would enable Aus-
tralia to be represented by one organisa-
tion at the IFAP conference to be held
in London in May, 1966. It would also
eliminate the separate approaches made
by both organisations to the six-monthly
economic discussions with the Common-
wealth Economic Sub-committee. Indeed,
a possible field of expansion might be in
presenting evidence to the Common-
wealth Arbitration Commission on basic
wage and margins cases. There are hopes
that this first stage would eliminate some
amount of the expense of dual secre-
tariats and enable something extra in the
way of economic research to be carried
out. Too often in the past, farmer or-
ganisations have been in a position of
being continually on the defensive, un-
able to take the initiative in important
questions and to foresee events before
they actually took place.
The promoting of a broader view is
taking place in a number of ways. We
already have been visited by Mr Eric
McCallum, president of the Federated
Farmers of New Zealand, who opened
the 1963 NFU annual conference. Dis-
cussions have since been taking place
regarding the planning of a Pacific
Regional Committee of the IFAP. This
will be further discussed when I take up
an invitation to open the 1965 confer-
ence of the Federated Farmers in New
Zealand in July.
The main need for the future is for
rank-and-file producers to back the more
effective Federal organisation which is
coming into being. The recommendation
on finance discussed by NFU in April
calls for a flat per capita subscription of
only 3s. 6d. per year. I hold the view
that the amount paid to a general pur-
pose organisation should not differ, no
matter which industry a farmer is in,
whether he be a wool-grower or a cotton-
producer. In the final analysis, then, the
success of the future is fairly and
squarely on the individual farmer’s
shoulders. He is not gambling very
much on 3s. 6d. per head per annum
the price of one packet of cigarettes!

Finding a New Chairman
The Wool Board after Gunn
llfiTH Sir William Gunn at last taking
" the plunge into politics (Maranoa
and Country Party, after all) an interest-
ing question arises. Who will get the
Wool Board job? The answer will not
be provided until Gunn gets elected by
the voters in Maranoa.
It can be assumed that he will be
elected. It can also be assumed —well,
hazarded, anyway that whoever does
get the Wool Board chairmanship will
not get quite the same post that Gunn
has occupied.
Increasingly, the Wool Industry Con-
ference is assuming the major role in
the wool industry. This was intended,
and it is happening. The chairman of
the proposed Wool Marketing Authority
(if reserve price selling gets the vote
of growers) will probably occupy a
more exalted position than the chairman
of the Wool Board.
Yet even if it is not quite the big
deal that Gunn made it, the Wool Board
job will attract candidates. Frankly,
there does not seem to be anyone around,
at present, who could be regarded as a
good thing. Like many a man in high
office, Gunn does tend to dominate his
associates.
Mr T. L. Bull, the Federal president
of the Woolgrowers and Graziers’ Coun-
cil, would be a possibility, but then he
is a Senator now and probably would
not be free. Also the other half of the
Wool Industry Conference, the Aus-
tralian Wool and Meat Producers’
Federation, would doubtless feel that it
was their turn to provide the chairman
of the Wool Board.
Gunn, despite opposition to the Wool
Board’s reserve price plan from sections
of the Graziers’ Association, is now,
and always has been, Graziers’ Associa-
tion. Despite all the criticism levelled
at him by Graziers’ Association people
from time to time, he has never been
in danger of losing his seat on their own
Federal council.
Trying to equate the various organisa-
tions in wool politics with political
parties (Liberal. Labor, DLP, etc.) is a
temptation, but it is not really like that
at all. The stage very definitely seems
to be set for a decline in Wool Board
stature and an increase in Government
participation in wool—regardless of the
outcome of the reserve price issue. Gunn,
sensibly, has not tried to disguise this.
He is admitting now, and in the past
he was a bit evasive, that woolgrowers
must expect that the Federal Govern-
ment will have a hand in wool marketing,
should growers vote in favor of reserve
price. He qualifies this by adding that
this participation will not mean that
woolgrowers will lose control of their
industry.
It is not very satisfactory, really. Gunn
obviously realises that a good many
growers accept the fact that the Govern-
ment already has its fingers in the wool
pie, just as it has in everything else. The
idea that the wool industry is beyond
Government influence is a myth a
cherished one, but a myth, nevertheless.
So, in wondering who will become
Wool Board chairman, one inevitably is
forced to the conclusion that the position
will become an administrative position
and not a policy-making one. An able
administrator might well be found out-
side the ranks of woolgrowers altogether.
This would not be surprising.
Gunn, in the Government, may wield
a bigger stick over the industry than he
ever did as Wool Board chairman. But
it will not be a simple progression. There
are danger signs ahead and he is not
going to fall into an easy job in Parlia-
ment at all.
The Liberal Party and the Country
Party appear to be on a collision course.
The accusations of gerrymander against
the Country Party over the Common-
wealth Electoral Bill have been heard,
and from at least three Liberal members.
This is, however, only the surface
disturbance. What is bugging the
Country Party more than anything is
the inability of the Liberal planners to
control the prices spiral. Unless rising
costs are halted, the reserve price issue,
and all other current issues in primary
industry, won’t mean a thing because
the bottom will have fallen out of
farming generally.
So Gunn will enter Parliament at a
time when things will be hotting up. He
is bound to incur the displeasure of a
section of the Liberal Party over his
ideas on trading with Red China. He
has made it quite clear, many times,
that he regards Red China as a
potentially enormous market for Aus-
tralian wool, along with wheat and other
primary produce.

Omega Seam aster, the world’s favourite precision sports watch. Winds itself. Hermetically sealed against water. Note onyx inlay of solid
gold hour markers. 14ct gold capped £95.0.0. Stainless steel £67.10.0.
The sturdy reliability of this Omega Seamaster
is proved in an atmospheric pressure chamber
Its accuracy and long life are assured by waterproofing tests in a
special simulator, unique to Omega
They take a watch. They plunge it a
hundred feet beneath the sea. Then they
suddenly catapult it to the height of
Mount Everest. And it still works
perfectly.
This happens every day with the Omega
Seamaster sports watch.
The drastic switch from a pressure of
three atmospheres to a partial vacuum
takes place in the Omega factory. In a
machine such as you will not find any-
where else in the whole watch industry.
A pressure simulator specially designed
by Omega.
Altogether, each Seamaster is “dived”
17 times. Through 17 different pressure
ranges. In the space of 45 minutes. The
tests ensure that the rugged Seamaster
case will withstand all the changes of
pressure that you can possibly encounter
■— in the air and beneath the sea.
And why does Omega indulge in this
costly and painstaking process? Because
the Seamaster movement is so accurate,
so finely built, that it deserves the best
protection watchmakers can give it.
Pressurizing conditions it for the rough,
tough life it has been designed to live.
For the life of a sportsman.
It will be a long life, too.
No wonder the sturdy accurate Sea-
master is praised wherever it goes by
parachutists, skin-divers, mountaineers,
racing motorists and countless other
sportsmen who lead a full, active life.
No wonder the Omega Seamaster is the
most sought-after precision watch in
the world.
Some day you, too, will own an Omega.

shock-protected and antimagnetic. 7 he calendar
