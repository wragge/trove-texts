THE RED PAGE
A Voice crying in the Desert.
"VTO man could be imagined with whom an
association of pathos would be more in-
-L. i congruous than Herbert Spencer, the
Apostle of Pure Reason, the foe to all
sentiment. Yet, that notwithstanding, there is a
suggestion of pathos in the preface to his latest
work, dated Brighton, March, 1902, which con-
cludes: “The volume herewith issued, I can say
with certainty, will be my last.” For something
like half-a-eentury now—ever since the epoch-
marking “Social Statics”—Spencer has lifted
up a strong, calm voice for dispassionate
thought, for clear, cold reason, to quell the clamor
of humbug, of hysteriaand of political harlequinism.
And his long, strenuous life draws to a close now
with the wild yells of the Maffickers still echoing
in the lofty
vaults of his
mind, conscious
of an unaccom-
plished pur-
pose and of a
foiled hope,
knowing the
pitifully small
numberofthose
who. have re-
ceived the word
and turned it
to profit. Her-
bert Spencer,
a _ remorseless
scientist, set
himself to dis-
sect sociology,
and to seek
conclusions in
regard to the
conditions of
human society
as exact as
those of Dar-
win and Huxley in others branches of thought.
It fell to him, therefore, as a part of this
life-work, to show the clay feet of many a most
popular idol, to expose to contempt such conven-
tions as “reverence,” “loyalty,” “patriotism”
(using these words in their generally accepted and
perverted sense), proving the one to be slavish-
ness, the other a relic of barbarism, the third an
hypocritical predatory instinct; and all of them
children of the Devil. This ranged against
him all the forces of chicanery. In fur-
ther pursuit of his life-mission Spencer
attempted to pattern the ideal social organ-
isation —on sternly individualistic lines, as
suited his Gothic temperament —and ignorant
criticism has accused him of preaching the im-
possible, though he always took care to make clear
that in setting forth the ideal he did not always
deem it the practical. Hatred and ignorance thus
raised up the great majority of mankind as foes to
his teaching. Now, after half a century of preaching
—after making some concessions to expediency, to
the weakness of Human Nature, from his first
most absolute declarations—Spencer concludes his
work, seeing England moving further and further
away from his ideals, thinking less and less
of Liberty, and more and more of those
things which, to his mind, merit oidy contempt.
It is not encouraging. Yet Spencer may take
comfort in the thought that the truth of his con-
clusions cannot be affected by the persecution of
governors, or the ignorance of the governed, and
in the natural evolution of the human mind must
one day find recognition.
“ Facts and Comments,” Spencer’s final work,
represents the lees of the wine-cup. A series of
fugitive essays on a wide variety of subjects, from
Meyerbeer’s music to Imperialism, and from vac-
cination and American slang to the Regressive
Multiplication of Causes—-they are but the crumbs
from the banquet which a great intellect has
set before Humanity. Nor do they purport to be
anything else, but are printed with an almost
apologetic preface. Anything, however, from
Herbert Spencer has a vital interest to contem-
porary thought, even things which verge on the
trivial, such as “A Few Americanisms” and
“Weather Forecasts” in this volume. But, in
addition to those, there is much that is important
for itself, and not merely as an illustration of a
great mind relaxing itself on trifles.
In “ State Education,” Mr. Spencer deals
mainly with a demoralised press “ awakening the
slumbering instincts of the barbarian ” in
the people. The power to do this, he contends,
is provided by the State, which educates people
up to newspaper-reading standard, but makes and
can make no provision to prevent intellectualisation
outstripping moralisation. In short, people are
educated to read who are not really, fit to read and
who fall a facile prey to the misrepresentations of
a pandering newspaper. So far, the philosopher
sees dearly. The remedy suggested—the abolition
of State education—is quite another matter. There
the modern reformer must part company with the
idealistic Individualist. Practically the abolition
of State education would be followed either (1) by
the establishment of a worse system of teaching—a
system more likely to produce prejudiced and
learnedly-ignorant citizens; or (2) the relapse of
many into absolute ignorance, leaving them a still
easier prey to the Chamberlains and other charla-
tans of the day.
An essay on patriotism merely repeats the
thought of previous utterances by the philosopher
on the same point—but gives to them an up-to-
date application. To quote.
To me the cry—“ Our country,, right or wrong 1 ” seems
detestable. By association with love of country the senti-
ment it expresses gains a certain justification. Do but
pull off the cldak, however, and the contained sentiment
is seen to lie of the lowest .... Suppose our country is
doing something which, bv the hypothesis, is admitted to
be wrong? What then is the implication of the cry?
The right is on the side of Rhose who oppose us ; the
wrong is on our side. llow in that case is to be expressed
the so-called patriotic wish? Evidently the words must
stand—“ Down with the right, up with the wrong 1 ”
Now in other relations this combination of aims implies
the acme of wickedness. ... It will be said, it would
never do to have each soldier use his judgment about the
purpose for which a battle is waged. Military organisa-
tion would be paralyzed and our country would be a
prey to the first invader. Not so fast, is the
reply. For one war an army would remain just as
available as now—a war of national defence
Only aggressive war would be negatived, not defensive
war. . . . . But those whose cry is—“ Our country, right
or wrong 1 ” and who would add to our SO odd possessions
others to be similarly obtained, will, contemplate with
disgust such a restriction upon military action. To them
no folly seems greater than that of practising on Monday
the principles they profess on Sunday.
“ Imperialism and Slavery ” strikes much the
same note. Imperialism represents in inter-
national, what chattel slavery does in domestic re-
lations. The slavery binds the enslaver just as
irksomely as the slave (a solemn truth that!)
Imperialism is necessarily associated with mili-
tancy. With the growth of it in England there
has been a corresponding dwindling of popular
privilege and of Liberty until personal rights are
being gradually merged and lost in a bureaucracy.
But, mournfully, Spencer concludes :
Among men who do not pride themselves on the pos-
session of purely human traits, but on the possession of
traits which they have in common with the brutes, and
in whose mouths “bull-dog courage” is equivalent to
manhood, no deterrent considerations like the above will
have any weight.
“ Maffickers,” 10th Century— from F. C. Gould's “ Modem Froissart.”
The English people will go on pursuing Empire
and finding slavery!
Other notable essays are those on “Re-Barbari-
sation, ” with its exposure of the growth of savage
ideas (the “ Blood and Eire ” cry of the Salvation
Army is instanced as typical), and “The Pursuit
of Prettiness,” condemning the vulgar taste for
the “ museum style ” of furnishing, and the over-
dressing of women.
The book has, finally, this merit: that it will
give to those who are not familiar with Spencer’s
great works many hints as to his views on social
problems, and possibly encourage them to a closer
study of the philosopher, The voice cries now in
a desert where there are but few listeners.
Some Minor Poetry.
THE last English mail brought two attrac-
tively printed books of minor poetry from
Elliot Stock, a publisher who makes a
specialty of that sort of work.
“Horae Fugaces,” by W. A. Adams, is the
second book of this versifier, the first having
been “Rus Divinum,” a set of pastoral poems
written during the siege of Ladysmith. “Rus
Divinum ” we must confess to not having read,
but “opinions of the press” on it, published in
this volume, are markedly favorable, particularly
one from London Daily Chronicle —usually a skil-
ful guide on literary matters; it is necessary,
therefore, to presume either that it had genuine
merit, or that the curiousness of a cavalry officer
writing pastoral poetry duringabitter siege blinded
the critical faculty of reviewers. If it was a work of
distinguished merit, it would seem that the
author's Muse had since deserted him, for
“Horae Fugaces” is simply a collection of
“album verse,” showing good powers of versifica-
tion, marked by a futile prettiness, but having
not a trace of poetic thought. This seems to be
the best verse of the lot
THE END.
Life is not sad, nor glad ; it just appears
A blank, with neither joy nor grief to fill
The void : there is no happiness can kill
The parasite forgetfulness : the tears
. Of anguish too run dry ; all hopes and fears
Have sunk to nothingness : there is no ill,
No wound, however deep it be, that will
Not feel the potent remedy by years
Applied. I feel I stand'beside the grave
Of dead ambition. All my so-called gains
And losses lie there too : the stones that pave
Our way through life, its pleasures past and pains
O’ercome, forgotten, over which the wave
Of Time has passed, and nothing now remains.
Graceful enough, smooth enough— but can anyone
give a thought-reason for its writing or printing ?
Still the book would be tolerable if it were all of
that kind. But one finds six silly lines headed—
Written in the Visitors’ Book at the hotel at Amanzim-
toti, Natal, South Africa.
Now in an edition of a Burns or a Byron the
publication of inanities scribbled extempore on
trivial occasions is tolerable. The greatness of
the man excuses, if indeed one cannot explain the
printing by recollecting that the author is
dead and doesn’t give his consent. But in the
book of a minor poet who is alive, the inclusion
of such matter show's an unpardonable degree of
vanity.
“Drift of Esla,” by William Gow, is mainly
good, graceful verse, sometimes markedly humor-
ous, though included in the drift is some rotten
wood which doesn’t grace the beach. “To a
Baby,” “To Keats,” and “To Theocritus”
strike the reader as the best of work, which is
nearly always of respectable merit. There is a
thought, too, in this :
SUPRA CREPIDAM.
Put on the harness of Necessity,
And bow’ thee to thy fate ;
By some invincible Adversity
Thou never canst be great.
The tokens of thy feebleness were printed
Even on thy baby brow,
Nor cry, nor prayer, nor even toil
Can make them alter now.
Or go, give up thy humble task for ever,
And fruitlessly on Fame and Fortune wait,
And spend thine efforts in a wild endeavour—
Thou never canst be great.
Too proud to do thy little round of duty,
aoo weak to scale the turret-towers of Fame,
Thou wilt have lost the little meed of beauty
Which might have crowned thy name.
‘ A Wrecker ” has another tilt at “ The
Breaker s ” verse—
“ Love me little, love me long ” —•
Laggard lover penned such song :
Rather, Nell!—in other style—
Love me much a little while !
He writes
You say to me-wards your affection’s strong,
May love me little, so you love me long.
is by Herrick, the poet, who also wrote—
Let moderation on thy passions wait,
Who loves too much, too much the lov’d will hate.
Byron has several lines with exactly the same
meaning as Morant’s, only differently expressed.
Christina Rosetti sings—
Time is short, life is short . .. .
Life is sweet, love is sweet, use to-day while you may.
Love is sweet, and to-morrow may fail.
Love is sweet, use to-day.
Morant’s poetry is typical of his blasted life.
How much worthier a sentiment is expressed in
this:—
And I read the moral- a brave endeavour
To do thy duty, whate’er its worth.
Is better than life with love for ever,
And love is the sweetest thing on earth.
[And still no plagiarism is proved. What “The
Breaker ” takes credit for is the perversion of the
thought, “Love me little, love me long,” to the
more human, the more truthful, the more poetic,
though the less sentimental, “Love me much a
little while.” No quotation from any other poet
so far sent to us gives the slightest hint that
Morant plagiarised the perversion.]
&
What wonderful bargains could bepieked-upfor
any Australian Art Gallery if it had only a friend
in London whose judgment could be relied on ;
who would attend the weekly sales at Christie’s
rooms and buy anything* good that was
going cheap. One day recently £ll5O bought
a Rossetti and a Burne-Jones, a Leighton
and a Watts, a Constable and a Sidney Cooper.
A gallery that goes into the market with money
in hand (as, for example, S.A. with the Elder
bequest), an avowed purchaser of pictures, would
pay about the same sum for one of the above
instead of the six.
&
A letter from a producer to The
Bulletin :—
Please let me know what you give for good pieces of
poetry. I have a lot that I composed myself. I never
sold any before. If you give a good price I will send you
some. I have been composing and writing poetry for 11
years, off and on. Write up soon and let me know.
And yet the Australian is said to be lacking in
push and energy! What could be more direct,
what more business-like than this offer of a con-
signment of poetry ?
From George Robertson and Co. we have re-
ceived “ Shacklett ” —a novel of A meriean political
life which strikes something of a new note and is
well worth the reading; and a cheap sixpenny
edition of “Nell Gwynne,” Frankfort Moore’s
novel concerning a Lady Who Did, to the great
profit of herself and to the bettering of the
English peerage.

Henry Lawson writes to The Bulletin :
I am sending Mrs. Lawson and the children out with
some friends by the German boat Karlsruhe—due in Syd-
ney about June 23—and will follow as soon as I git
through the proofs of a new book which I am publishing
through Methuen.
Have been wonderfully successful from a literary point
of view— work in Blacfcwood’s, Cassell’s, Chamber’s, etc.,
and offers from most of the publishers—but my health
has completely broken down, and I must come home for
a year or so. Some of my stories are being translated
into German. I know London as well as I know the
Bush, and propose to write of London for the Australian
papers and of Australia for the London papers.
“I know London ” —a bit of a delusion that! It
would take a lifetime to know London. Not that
full knowledge is the best basis for such impres-
sionist pictures as Lawson writes.
N.S. W. EducationDepartmenthasprescribedfor
1902 the study by sth-class pupils of Shakespeare’s
“ Henry V.” The [day is supplied in handbook-
form to the scholars, who are allowed to take it
home for study. One at least of the teachers,
before handing out the books to the pupils, took
upon himself to expurgate “ obnoxious passages.”
He carefully pasted together pages 29 and 31
(containing nearly the whole of Act 11., scene 1),
while the whole of the upper parts of pages 35 and 36
(containing the end of scene 2, Act III.) were
considered so shocking by this uneasy moralist
that he cut them out of the book.
S
The obvious but probably unavoidable disad-
vantage of the “Braille” type for the blind is
that it takes up so much room. Even the very
little magazine Morning, which the S.A. Indus-
trial School for the Blind has just produced, con-
taining as much as would go on four pages of The
Bulletin, runs to the dimensions of a Family Bible.
One of Auntie Pulsford’s Freetrade speeches
would block Pitt or George-street if treated in
this type. Morning is the first magazine for the
blind in Australia, and is said to be the third in
the world printed with movable Braille letters.
That fine old philanthropist, R; Barr Smith, came
down with a cheque for £llO to cover preliminary
exes.
Some correspondents:—
Matrix : As to “a better full-stop : ” Put a two-em
quad after every dot representing a full stop. That will
give half-an-irich of blank space, and serve every neces-
sary purpose. Or, with large type, a four-em quad might
be used if space is no object, and the writer thinks a lot
of himself! Some people favor a thin stroke (/) like that
employed in denoting shillings and pence.
Petronius: At a recent lecture, Melbourne Professor
Tucker ventilated a grievance against Australian
writers: “That they- desire to impress the reader
with the Australianity of all things Australian;” and
he followed with the astounding' statement that all
true literature was cosmopolitan. Great art may be-
cosmopolitan, but such art is the exception, not the rule.
Turgenieff says that Russia could do without all her
writers, but none of her writers could do without Russia.
Without nationality there could be nothing, neither life,
nor truth, art, nor literature. Shakespeare even was
intensely English. No matter what period or country he
chose as the setting for his plays he always depicted the
life of his own age and country. And who could be more
national than Hugo, or Tennyson ? It is only the local,
the characteristic, the individual trait that has the widest
appeal. If any Australian artist expresses even one
phase of Australian life, artistically and completely, his
work will appeal to the whole world ; but if he endeavors
to express everything in general and nothing in particu-
lar his work will appeal to nobody, not even to Professor
Tucker. It is by working within limits that the artist
reveals himself ; and it is by just being national that an
artist ultimately achieves the universal. .
[There is a lot of truth on both sides. ‘ ‘ Fetronius ”
is right in asserting that the literary artist must be-
gin by being national. Professor Tucker is right in
that only what goes beyond the national and is uni-
versal wins immortality. A genre literature,
depending for its success on careful treatment of
local color (and that covers most of the best Aus-
tralian writing, so far), can never reach to the first
raqk. But there are very comfortable and very
honorable seats below the salt. As for Shakes-
peare, none of his claim to immortality depends
on his Englishism, but all of it on what of him
is universal.]

HUMAN POISONS ...
and THEIR ANTIDOTE.
The Blood in the course
of its circulation be-
comes laden with vari-
ous poisons produced in
the human body by the
mere act of living.
t is the province of the
Kidneys and Liver to
filter and extract these
poisons from the blood.
When the Kidneys and
Liver are unhealthy the
poisons remain in the
body and give rise to
such diseases as
Indigestion
Dyspepsia
Biliousness
Sick Headache
Rheumatism
Gout
Neuralgia
Lumbago
Backache
Sciatica
Anaemia
General Debility
Blood Disorders
Bright’s Disease
Gravel
Bladder Troubles
All these diseases are
caused by Urinary and
Biliary Poisons being
deposited in the mus-
cles or joints, or being
retained in the blood.
Warner’s Safe Cure,
by its specific action
upon the Kidneys and
Liver, causes these
poisons to be naturally
eliminated and expelled
from the body.
The disease is then
cured permanently.

WE PUBLISH EVIDENCE LIKE THIS.
The Case of Mr. A. LYES.
(for the “standard.”)
The requirements of the Australian popu-
lace can only be arrived at by reference to
the statistics which are compiled at various
periods, and as evidence is necessary for the
purpose of gauging popular opinion, it may
here be interesting to listen to Mr. Albert
Lyes, of No. 7 Frazer-street, Leichhardt
“ When living in the North Coast dis-
trict,” said Mr. Lyes, “ I experienced a
vast amount of trouble with my liver and
kidneys, the consequence being that I was
put to a lot of inconvenience owing to the
acute pains across the small of my back.
As I had heavy work to do at the time, my
afflictions came as a great hardship, more so
if there was any lifting to be done, when my
back pains were intensified to a degree that
I could scarcely endure.”
Reporter: “ Were you much affected in
any other part ? ”
Mr. Lyes : “ It would be quicker for me
to tell you where I was not affected, for I
had aches and pains all over me. There
was a cold, painful sensation in the spine
which felt as if somebody had shot a ball of
ice along my back, and that horrible shoot-
ing pain extended right to my eyes, which
also gave me the impression of being
swollen I was sluggish, drowsy, and had
no energy whatever, the only thing I felt
fit for being to lie down—it did not matter
where. is a serious matter for a married
man to get into that condition, but I held
out as long as I could, and then I had
to give in, for all the grit was taken out
of me. Being without any appetite, which
had been on t' e wane for a long time, the
chances of stopping a further leakage of my
vitality were very remote, and as I could not
sleep at all well at nights, there was no
doubt that I was in a very grave state. With
my tongue covered with a nasty substance
and a vile taste in my mouth, there is
nothing remarkable in the fact that I could
not enjoy any food, and in the natural
course of events I got a long way thinner
than I ought to have done. I was tor-
mented with very severe headaches which
made me feel so gloomy and wretched that
there seemed to be nothing in the world
worth living for, and with my weakness
daily increasing, my limbs ached so persis-
tently that I could not even take a walk in
comfort. Palpi fat ion of the heart and dizzi-
ness always follow ed any exertion, my
heart being particularly bad. It used to
make a thumping souud like the noise from
a horse’s hoof heard in the distance, and
many an anxious hour have I passed in
thinking what might be wrong with that
organ. Like most people who suffer like
this for the first time, I consulted a
doctor, tvho said that my liver and kidneys
were disea-ed. He wrote a prescription,
which I had made up, and said I would
have to keep as quiet as possible, and not
exert myself any more than was absolutely
necessary.”
Reporter: “ How did you feeL after
taking his medicine?”
Mr. Lyes : “ Just about the same as
before, and when I saw it was only so much
waste to take any more I dropped it off.
The oppression in my chest and the flatu-
lence in my stomach were still there, and
the urine remained of a cloudy and scanty
nature, so what was the use of throwing
any more money aw >y I thought ? Besides,
my nervous system was completely out of
order, as any kind of noise, had a startling
effect which kept my nerves at extreme
tension, as if they had been suddenly un-
hinged, and then, again, I felt agitated and
irritable at the slightest provocation. The
long-continuance of these sufferings had
made me very morose and low-spirited, for
there werfwothers to think of besides my-
self; but, thank goodness! that trying
ordeal is all over now, and it is not likely
to be repeated, because I discovered a
remedy which cured my ailments then, and
I am sure it could do so again if ever I
needed it.”
Reporter: “ May I learn what the remedy
was ? ”
Mr. Lyes : “ I have no desire to keep the
matter secret, because I might do other
poor sufferers a good turn by letting you
know. It was Clements Tonic —a medicine
that I had been reading about—that made '
a new man of me, and I always regard it as
my only friend amongst all medicines. I :
had only taken a couple of bottles of
Clements Tonic when I felt ever so much
better. In fact, the change was so great
that I could scarcely believe it myself,
especially as I had lost confidence in
physics generally. But Clements Tonic
asserted itself as something uncommonly
good by rapidly giving me a desire for food,
and in the matter of making me sleep well
I thought it a most marvellous medicine.
The health-giving properties of Clements
Tonic were not confined to those improve-
ments. as it amended the defects in my
internal organs which had gone against the
digestion of my food, and by those means
the pains in my chest and shoidders were
relieved. The fermentation of my food
was done away with in like manner, so that
I was getting the full benefit of my meals,
and how well I knew it ! for the returti of
my strength was quite noticeable. I no
longer desired to lie about in a state of
careless languor, for Clements Toni -, gave
me the energy and ambition to do some
work, which was becoming easier to per-
form each day, because the pains in my
back were less troublesome as time moyed
on. My heart gave me no occasion to
worry myself, as it was beating with a
regular pulsation, and with the departure
of my headaches my sight became so clear
that I could sit down and read for hours
without the least inconvenience. •' I was
greatly pleased with Clements Tonic fer-
tile effect it had on my nervous system,
for it invigorated my nerves so thoroughly
that they became perfectly steady, while
such a thing as becoming excited or annoyed
over trifling incidents did not happen. A
good indication to go by as to the efficacy of
Clements Tonic was the entire removal of
my deranged kidney symptoms, and it was
then that I was altogether free from pain.”
Reporter : “ Did you stop taking your
medicine immediately that happened ? ”
Mr. Lyes: “Not exactly, for I wanted
to be quite sure that all disease was effaced,
so I took another couple of bottles of
Clements Tonic, and when they were
finished it was not necessary to take any
more, as I was as strong and thoroughly
restored as I could wish to be. It is several
years ago since t lements Tonic put an end
to my sufferings, yet my work has never
since interfered with my health —a fact
which shows that Clements Tonic made me
as sound as a bell ; and if these statements
are likely to e perused by others, you may
publish them as you like.”

Indigestion from
Birth
“My little girl can now digest
anything ”
One of the most difficult of home prob-
lems is how to get food to suit the baby—it
is twice as difficult if the child has weak-
ness of the digestive organs. Here is the
solution in both cases :
“ Nelson Street, Whittington Moor,
“ Chesterfield, England, March 28th, 1901.
“ Dear Sirs, —My daughter, Olive, aged
two and a half years, had suffered from
acute indigestion from birth and caused us
great trouble and anxiety. She has cost
me pounds for various remedies that have
been tried, but all proved of no avail, for
nothing suited her or made her thrive. Her
food was rejected almost as soon as taken,
and the poor little thing suffered great
distress. We almost gave up all hope of
rearing her, and knowing how she suffered,
her release would almost have been a
OLIVE SMITH.
(From a photograph.)
blessing. I decided to try Scott’s Emulsion.
I was much surprised and greatly delighted
to notice a radical change for the better in
my child’s condition shortly after giving
her your preparation. She was able to
take and retain her food, and what is more,
it certainly appeared to do her good, for
she soon gained in both flesh and. strength.
I have now given Scott’s Emulsion a fair
trial, and am thankful to say my little
girl has been completely cured and can
now eat and digest anything, and I must
give Scott’s Emulsion the credit. I feel
it is not too much to say that we owe her
life to your splendid remedy.—Yours very
cinr»prpl v
“ (Signed) Chas. Smith.”
You know enough of the ebb and flow of
health in children to be aware that the child
is going on well when it “ can eat and digest
anything.” You will have noticed from the
day the child was born that it was to the
question of food the doctor paid the most
attention. It is in just such cases as these
—impaired digestion—that Scott’s Emul-
sion is of the first importance.
It acts always as it did in the case of
Olive Smith: as a medicine in removing the
cause of the indigestion, as a food in adding
flesh and strength. This double action of
Scott’s Emulsion, unique among remedies,
is just what all substitutes and imitations
fail to secure. You can therefore realise
the difference between Scott’s Emulsion
which cures and “ other things ” which
always produce “ other results.” There is
nothing “ just as good ” as Scott’s Emulsion.
Scott’s Emulsion has none of the ob-
jectionable features of common cod-liver
oil, is taken by children with eagerness.
Comparing common cod-liver oil with
Scott’s Emulsion a distinguished physician
writes us : “ Your Emulsion is three times
as efficacious as a similar quantity of
common cod-liver oil.”
On the wrapper of every bottle of Scott s
Emulsion is a picture of a man carrying a
big fish—if he and the fish are absent it is
not Scott’s Emnl«' n ri.
You can obtain a sample of Scott’s Emulsion
by sending fourpence to Scott & Bowne, Ltd.,
483 Kent-street, Sydney, and mentioning this
paper. A.ll chemists sell Scott’s Emulsion.

Night Thoughts.
Dame Midnight, from her ancient keep,
She looketh forth afar,
And when she knows the World’s asleep,
She bids the gates unbar.
A thousand Dreams, at her behest,
March from the House of Pain,
Their sole thought, which may pleasure best
Their bleared old chatelaine.
In dusky mail they issue out,
And march with steady pace;
Each winds a silken cloak about
The horror of his face.
They march thro’ city and thro’ camp,
And thro’ the empty mart;
Along the echoing streets they tramp,
They tramp across my heart.
Yea, night by weary night, I trow,
My heart their highway is ;
And each unwinds his cloak, that so
My eyes may look in his.
Vain is the lock, the bolt is vain,
They needs must enter in— *
Black thoughts that sear and scar my brain,
Red thoughts that burn my skin.
And tho’ the moon may never know
What horror night conceals,
My morning heart will surely show
The print of iron heels.
W.M.
Playmate.
There were so many others, true hearts the gods
desired,
So very many others grown gray and old and
tired;
How was it that the angels across the golden gate
Leaned down to take your clinging hand, your
tiny hand, Playmate ?
The road has grown so lonely, the mists have
grown so blind !
So many played beside me, but only you were
kind!
I never cared for winning, dear, or what the game
we played,
Until the day your gentle hand within my own
was laid.
I cannot play at Laurels now, I cannot play at
Love ;
Not knowing if your blue eyes glance a God-speed
from above.
Ah ! God ! The broken playthings ! The broken
heart and pen !
I fling them on Love’s altar-fire —I cannot play
again!
A little time to weep for you, a little time to fret,
Then shadows on the playground, dear, to show
the sun is set;
Ah ! when the golden stars come out to light the
Ivory Way,
God lay your little hand in mine—the hand I held
at play 1
WILL OGILVIE.
Our Girl!
BEFORE THE GLASS—AND BEHIND.
When our girl, Phoebe, goes to church,
Her rivals chafe to see,
That city folks, of dainty garb,
Hold no monopoly !
Their thoughts are set on things mundane
While prayers are being read—
That sweet confection of a toque
Which graces Phoebe’s head.
And when they stand to sing the hymn,
The cut of Phoebe’s gown
Provokes the choir to cranky notes
And makes the envious frown.
But, oh ! upon the picnic-ground
The wicked throng to see,
When Phoebe plays a round of games
With show of lingerie !
Audacious Phoebe’s home again ;
A-milking forth she goes,
Wearing her draggled petticoat,
With slippers out at-toes.
If some prim suitor came along,
He’d ne’er survive the shock ;
At seeing Phoebe’s towzled curls
Hid ’neath Dad’s billy-cock.
My ! she’s the girl to harness up,
Or make the soap-suds fly ;
Trust her to give the timely quip
When angry words are nigh.
Yet when there’s stacking to be done
(A prude beyond compare),
Before she ventures up aloft
She dons Dad’s widest pair!
And when she goes a-winnowing,
With dimpled arms, and bare—
The stripper horses start to jib,
And keep their drivers there.
But Phoebe’s good to all the boys
Who haven’t got a girl,
Yet leads them such a merry dance
In tantalising whirl.
Old Squatter Bullion pressed his suit—
She shook a wayward curl,
And couldn’t wed him ’cos she was
A farmer’s servant-girl /
And when his sons would fain propose,
With mien demure and shy,
She really cannot marry till
They put some money by.
* * * *
Again, when Phoebe goes to church,
Her rivals chafe to see
That city dames, with hearts to let,
Hold no monopoly !

FREE TO THE
RUPTURED.
Dr. W. S. Rice, the well-known New York Hernia "
Specialist, sends a trial of his famous method F ItEE
TO ALL. Anyone can now cure themselves at
home without pain, danger, operation, or an hour’s
loss of TIME FROM WORK.
At the earnest request of British patrons, Dr. Rice
has opened Branch Offices at 9d Stonecutter St.,
bondon, E.C., and to the thousands upon thousands
of ruptured people who are torturing themselves
with bad trusses, and are in momentary danger of
death from strangulation, will send free to all a
trial of his famous method that has saved so many
lives and made so many men, women, and children
well and strong and permanently cured of bad Rup-
tures, Do not be backward about writing for the
FREE TRIAL. It will cost you nothing, and will
enable you to see how easily you can cure yourself
in a short time without losing an hour irom work.
Dr. Rice is determined that every suffering man or
woman shall know the wonderful truth that Rupture
can be cured, and he therefore generously sends,
prepaid by post, his method absolutely free, and you
can make a trial of it. Remember that it is the
same method that Mr. Thomas Blay (whose picture
is given below) used ; and who can deny the truth
when it is put before them in so clear a light? It
must indeed, be welcome words to the afflicted.
WORDS OF PRAISE FROM Mr. BLAY.
No. 5, Ripley Terrace, Luddenden Foot,
..JWL S. Bice. April, 6,1901.
Dear Sir,—After using your treatment for three
months I find myself cured of my Rupture, at the
age of 55. I had been ruptured for ten years.
I shall advise all people afflicted with this com
plaint to use your treatment, as I know from
experience that it will cure permanently. You must
have a wonderful knowledge of rupture to fit one
so perfectly without seeing the rupture.
I am in good health now, something I have not
enjoyed for ten years before. You can use this
letter in any way you choose, and X hope it will
guide others to a pe'rfect cure.—Yours truly,
T. BDAY.
There is absolutely no question about the curative-
ability of this combined and perfected method. It
has stood the test of time; it has been through the fire
of critical cases ; it has come out victorious in every
curable nstance. It has saved the child to a life ot
independence; it has given the youth his natural
endow ment of health and strength to fighttke battle
of life successfully; it has conquered the blight upon
old age and turned years of suffering into ending
days of joy and giadness. Whoever is Ruptured, or
knows a person suffering with Rupture, should keep
in mind the fact that in eighty per cent, of all cases
there is a daily liability that before night they may
say good-bye to earthly things. Does not this fact
influence one to pause and consider whether they
are using their best efforts in the way a wise Creator
intended they should? And if the forethought, the
research,©and the painstaking effort of one who
invents and studies for the relief of others is placed
in our hands, is it not our duty to read and listen
patient!v,that we may take.advantage of thatwhich
contributes to our earthly benefit?

The Star-Grist.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Hast thou seen the fairy-mills
All a-busy grinding stars
In the dimples of the hills
And beside the river-bars ?
Hast thou seen them at the close
Of a happy summer day,
When each eager fairy goes
To bear the grist of stars away ?
Hast thou seen them hang stars up
In the chancel of the sky,
Or—like gem in drinking-cup—
Hide them in some beauty’s eye ?
Hast beheld the fairies go?
(Heavy stars they carry there)
And conceal them in the flow
Of my sweetheart’s golden hair ?
Hast thou seen the little gods
Going home at night from toil,
Hopping back into the pods ’
For the morrow’s starry moil ?
O, hast thou seen the mills re-ope,
And the stars come tumbling down,
Crimson, white, and heliotrope,
Dappled-grey and tressy-brown ?
Hast thou heard the merry mills
To the fairy people say :
"Oh ye little Jacks and Jills,
Come and take these stars away /
“ Hide them in the sapphire sea
For the mermaid-girlies' cheer;
Drop them soft and carefully
In each weary mammal's beer.
" Place them lightly in the oup
Of the weary beggar-man;
When the little ladies sup,
Hide one in each patty-pan.
" When you see a heart forlorn,
Deck it round with special stars ;
When a fair sea-ship is born,
Twine them rowid her taper spars /**
If you have not heard the mills
Whisper to the fairies thus,
You are deafer than the hills,
You have missed Creation’s ’bus.

The Canadian Banking System.
The hint dropped by Treasurer Turner,
that the Federal Government might adopt
the Canadian banking system, as a means of
raising money with which to acquire a
Federal Territory and construct a Federal
capital without floating the otherwise
inevitable and ruinous loan, has roused a
certain small amount of opposition. Sydney
Telegraph, which is the bitterest op-
ponent, has five highly probable reasons
for objecting. The proposed device is an
idea borrowed from a Protectionist State—
Canada. It ifi proposed, or at least sug-
gested, by a Federal Protectionist Ministry.
The Minister whose remark showed that
the Federal Government might take the
matter up is a Victorian, and nothing good
ever comes from Victoria. He is likewise a
member of a Government which refused to
subsidise the free morning trains of the
Sydney Freetrade dailies, and which pro-
poses to suppress the enormous measure of
Protection which they enjoy, as against the
pipers of the other States,’in the shape of
free postage—and nothing good ever comes,
or ever can come, from that Government.
Also, the proposal implies a divergence
from the old habit of importing loans, and to
put a check on the habit of importing things
is objectionable to a class to which import-
ing has come to be one of the seven deadly
virtues. And yet, with all this, the case
advanced against the proposed innovation is
about the weakest thing imaginable. Canada
may not be a great place in every respect,
yet there are six points in which Australia
would do well to imitate it—its banking
system, the smallness of its debt, its sur-
pluses, its habit of running its State legisla-
tures with one House only, its cheap
locally-produced State Governors, and the
weighty Protectionist tariff which has built
up its industries till it is the leading pro-
vince of Greater Britain, and owns, despite
its little population of 5,400,000, nearly half
shipping of Greater Britain (population
360,000,000).
There is good reason why some change is
wanted in the utter wastefulness of the pre-
sent bank ng system in Australia. This
country holds more gold per head than any
other in the world, and the immense gold
reserves—immense in proportion to popula-
tion in its banks are a source of great loss.
They amount, as a rule, to something like
£2o,ooo,ooo—money which is, to a great
extent, lying idle and earning nothing. If
this money belonged to Australia it would
matter less, but Australia doesn’t possess a
single copper or threepenny piece of its own.
All the money it has, and nearly ten times
all the money it has, is borrowed at an
average rate of 3f per cent. The £20,000,000
in gold which lies in the banks of the Com-
monwealth costs the country £750,000 a year
in interest, which is an appalling tax on an
embarrassed and impoverished community
whose only return is the knowledge that the
mineral is there—it hasn’t even the empty
satisfaction of looking at it. If only
£10,000,000 of it could be set free (being
replaced by some circulating medium which
would answer local purposes as well) and
used to reduce old debts or to prevent the
accumulation of new debts, it would save the
country £375,000 a year. One reason why
it seems reasonable to suppose this can be
done is that Australia makes less use of
paper money, in proportion to population,
than almost any other country on earth.

There is no question in this matter of
creating an inconvertible paper currency, of
confiscating any bank’s property, or of
upsetting any business arrangement or old-
established institution whatever. The sug-
gestion is neither Freetrade nor Protec-
tionist. It has no connection with any
Labor programme, nor is it directly related
to “ Socialism in Our Time.” It is a plain
business proposition with no political color
at all, and its main features are these :
(1) That the half-sovereign should be abolished as a
means of economising gold, a substance which is useful
m paying the country’s foreign debts, and replaced by a
Government note for 10s.
(2) That the Federal Government should issue paper
money in notes of £l, 10s., and perhaps even 55., and
that the banks should be required to hold, say, half their
cash reserves, which average about £20,000,000, in Govern-
ment notes. They would pay them out if required, or
if the customer demanded them, but except in such a
time of stress as 1893, when all N.S.W. paper was made
legal tender, there would be no need to make them a
compulsory currency over the bank’s counter. Outside
the banks the notes would be legal tender, but the
Federal Treasury would cash them on demand.
(3) These Government notes would be of no service in
paying foreign obligations, which have to be met in gold,
but for internal circulation they would serve as well as
gold. The protection of the banks would lie in this : If a
bank held a cash reserve of £2,000,000 (£1,000,000 in coin
and £1,000,000 in Government paper), and it paid away
£400,000 in gold to a foreign, creditor (leaving it with
£600,000 coin and £1,000,000 Government paper) it could
demand from the Treasury gold for £200,000 of its paper
money to restore the balance. And by this process any
bank which was sinking through a run upon it by foreign
creditors would find its reserve as available as if it con-
sisted wholly of gold.
(4) Where the Government would come in would be in
the fact that the aggregate coin reserves of the banks
of the Commonwealth seldom, even in such times as 1893,
fall below £20,000,000 and then very little below. Gold
drawn out of one bank-goes into another, and a demand
by one bank for gold in exchange for its notes would be
accompanied by a demand by other banks for notes in
exchange for gold to make good their balance.
(5) The Government note issue would not necessarily
supersede the private issues of the banks. It is certainly
advisable that it should do so, but that is another subject.
Government paper money has not extinguished private
bank notes either in Canada or the United States. But
Queensland has a circulation of State paper only, all
private banking issues being abolished, and it would be a
misfortune to go back on this valuable precedent. Also
the earnings of the Queensland banks show that the
alleged loss to these institutions through the abolition of
their private note circulations is wholly mythical.
(0) Under the proposed new regime the power of the
Government to make paper money temporarily an in-
convertible forced currency in times of stress would, of
course, remain as at present. In England notes of the
Bank of England have been made a forced currency in
bad times, and the same sort of thing happened in New
South Wales i- 1893.
* ? • *
The arrangement above outlined would
give the Federal Government the use, with-
out interest, of a sum which would probably
amount to £10,000,000 at the beginning and
which, as the Government notes got into
wider circulation, would probably reach
£12,000,000 or much more. If the Treasury
held a gold reserve of £2,000,000 it would
be ample for all demands, and the balance
would be available for public uses. There
is no question in all this of plundering any
bank, or confiscating anything. It is a case
of the people's Government, with the
people’s consent, taking the use of a portion
of the people’s money for the people’s pur-
poses, and providing them with an efficient
substitute. The bank’s cash reserves are the
money of the people, not of the banks, and
are held as security for the people’s deposits.
No bank keeps any cash reserves as security
for its own funds—its capital; they are
simply part of the deposits held to meet
casual demands by depositors. If the people
are content that a portion of their reserves
shall be kept in Government paper instead
of in gold, no one else has a right to com-
plain—especially as no one makes any loss
by the process. And the people would gain
to this extent: If the money was applied to
pay off old foreign debts, or to acquire a
Federal Territory and a Federal capital, of
which the Commonwealth would be sole and
perpetual ground landlord, and the rents of
which would be applied, on the compound
interest principle, in reduction of foreign
debts, either way the people would begin to
get rid of their crushing foreign burdens ;
and as the sinking fund increased at com-
pound interest, they would reduce these
burdens at an ever-increasing ratio. This
would be done with no extra taxation what-
ever. It would simply arise but of the fact
that £10,000,000 or £12,000,000 of bor-
rowed money, which is now lying idle and
costing fc!370,000 or £450,0U0 a year in
interest, would be put to use, and that
amount of interest saved.
* • » *
Of course there are objections on the part
of the banks, and of such papers as Sydney
Telegraph professing to speak on their
behalf. There is wild talk about confisca-
tion and so on, and if the money which it
was proposed to deal with belonged to the
banks instead of to the people there might
be some justification for these excited obser-
vations. There are frantic and ridiculous
suggestions about shifting the Australian
and Tasmanian cash reserves to Maoriland
and holding them there, so as to be out of
reach of any such Federal law as proposed.
All this, of course, is an indirect suggestion
that, though the banks would lose nothing,
they want to be paid for getting out of their
old rut—in which sense it is partly proposed
piracy and partly suggested bushranging. If
the banks shared in the profit the manner
of viewing the case would probably be
different. It is simply suggested that,
where £lOOO in coin of depositors’ money
now lies idly and unprofitably in the
banks’ vaults, there should in future
lie there, just as idly and unprofitably,
£5OO in gold and £5OO of Government
paper, the other £5OO of coin being utilised
for reproductive purposes ; and the right of
the caretaker —for that is all that the banks
amount to as far as their cash reserves
are concerned—to object, if the owners are
satisfied, isn’t very easy to define, except by
assuming that it arises from the beastly
arrogance of the caretaker, and the tendency
of night watchmen and such people to have
undue ideas of their own importance. Sup-
posing it was proposed that the banks should
receive, say, 10s. per cent, per annum on
their minimum holding of Government notes
for each year, so that their cash reserve
would still be an immediately available cash
reserve and yet a source of profit at the same
time, and £10,000,000 which now brings in
nothing would yield £50,000 a year profit,
it is probable that they would see the matter
in quite a different and much more friendly
light. Also, it is possible that the amount
of Government notes they would hold would
be so much above the legal limit that the
extra profit to the Government would cover
the interest paid to the banks. And if
it was specified that the amount received by
the banks as interest on their holding of
Government paper should not be treated as
ordinary profit, but should in every case be
carried to reserve, and the reserve thus
created invested, at least partly, in Govern-
ment securities, there would lie some good
points about this concession. It would tend
to keep more of the notes out of circulation,
and a note issue which lies quietly in a bank
costs very little for renewal. Another
probable objection on the part of the private
banks is that the necessity for the Govern-
ment holding a cash reserve against its note
issue might hasten the establishment of a
Commonwealth Bank to hold it in, but as
the Commonwealth Bank is coming in any
case that is a difficulty of less importance.
* * • •
But none of this is worth doing unless the
money thus obtained is used, "directly or
indirectly, to reduce the, public debt.' It
might be used directly by employing it to
establish a sinking fund which would accu-
mulate at compound interest, or indirectly
by employing it to acquire a Federal terri-
tory and establish a Federal city of which
the Commonwealth would be sole and per-
petual ground-landlord, and the rents of
which would go to form such a sinking fund.
If the money was frittered away in small
jobs it would only mean that there would be
two or three years of ease, during which the
community would learn to object still more
strongly than it does now to paying its way
out of taxation, and when the money was
spent things would be worse than they were
before. If a party which has a fixed purpose
to reduce the public liabilities, and which is
capable of seeing a little further ahead than
to-morrow or the middle of next week, takes
the matter up, then the objectionable half-
sovereign (which always looks like a sixpence
after dark) wouldn’t be banished in vain.
The Iron Bonuses.
The decision of the House of Representatives to
give bonuses in aid of the iron industry, provided
it is an industry owned by a State Government,
and not otherwise, reduces the situation to unex-
pected confusion—unless the House changes its
mind, which seems unlikely considering the size
of the majority. New South Wales has privately-
owned ironworks at Lithgow. They are not
large, employing some 300 or 400 men. They
were started under a Protective system, and when
the open, honest Protection was withdrawn they
were surreptitiously protected by a sneaking Free-
trade Government, which gave them special rail-
way rates, equal to £1 per ton State aid. Still,
they have only been works for melting down
scrap iron and putting it in new shape, but with
the prospect of definite and solid Protection,
either by duties or bonuses, under the new
Federal regime, Sandford floated his concern
into a large company—mostly English—with a
view to working New South Wales ores.
It is a grievous pity that another Aus-
tralian industry should start largely under foreign
ownership, in a country where the absentee is
already so very numerous. Still, seeing that our
railways, roads, telegraphs, telephones, harbors,
etc., are all owned abroad to this extent that the
money with which they were built is owing there,
and that most of our fire insurance offices, several
of our banks, a whole multitude of our pastoralists,
most of our big importing firms, our big land com-
panies, our private landlords and our shipping
concerns.are foreign-owned, in whole or in great
part, this wasn’t a new difficulty. And as the
Opposition didn’t stipulate that the suggested
State ironworks should be Australian-owned,
instead of belonging in reality to the British
money-lender, this couldn’t have been the ground
of objection. It is at least better for our iron to
be manufactured here by a partly English, partly
Australian co., employing Australian labor, paying
Australian taxes, and helping to make Australian
railways profitable, than that it should be manufac-
tured by an English co. in England and do none
of these things.
* • • »
It was reckoned that the new iron industry to be
established under the Federal Government’s
bonus system would employ as many as 3000 men
at Lithgow. This was saying nothing of the
possibility of other works starting in other
p’aces. When one considers the relative sizes
of things, and compares what the Foreign-
traders insist on calling this “ unnatural ” and
“artificial” iron industry with the great
“natural” industry of sheep and cattle raising,
the results are curious. The employment of
3000 men, and the maintenance of their wives
and families, would mean that this single in-
dustry at Lithgow would support as many people
as the whole population of 41 pastoral counties of
N.S.W. all combined. And it wouldn’t be an
industry that would require artificial support to
anything like the same extent the pastoral industry
has done. It is questionable if the pastoral busi-
ness over the Western half of N.S.. Wales has
ever been self-supporting ; certainly it has helped
itself to huge bonuses by swallowing up, to a
greater or less extent, the funds of every institu-
tion which has ventured its money in the western
half of the State. Whatever may be the possi-
bilities of the Western sheep and cow business if
it is aided, coddled and pauperised by an
enormous expenditure of other people’s money
on irrigation, it has so far been the most
“unnatural” (in the Ereetrade sense) producing
trade and the worst parasite in N.S.W. The iron
industry, if started on a large scale by bonuses,
and afterwards supported by Protection, would at
least pay vastly better wages than the Western
pastoral business does. It couldn’t possibly absorb
in bonuses one-tenth so much of the nation's
money as the Western cow and sheep business
has done. It wouldn’t be blighted by droughts. It
wouldn’t be craving for millions to be spent on irri-
gation ; for fodder to be carried at public expense ;
or for huge sums to be paid away on locking any
Western river. It wouldn’t burden the country, as
the pastoral industry has done for years, with a
great permanent loss on railways built to open up
sheep country. (The rents of 44,000,000 acres of
pastoral leases, now down to about £150,000 a
year, are a per contra, but they mostly go
in necessary State expenses belonging to the
leased country.) It is a great pity that the
proposed new iron industry shouldn’t be wholly
Australian-owned ; still so much of the wool in-
dustry is also foreign-owned that things are just
about equal between the two.
* «• * *
And .N.S.W. isn’t in a position to look its
horse in the mouth too closely just now,
though it might be desirable to argue with the
animal at some length later on. Over a great deal
more than half the State both sheep and popula-
tion have been decreasing for years, and it
is necessary to find some new form of employ-
ment on a large scale for the country to live on, it
being impossible to keep the unemployed alive
with loan funds for ever. Providence put iron
and coal in N.S.W., and it didn’t put either
sheep, cattle, horses, wheat, oats or potatoes, so
the iron industry may fairly claim to be a natural
industry, while the others can’t. In any
case, the situation is this : Tp absorb its un-
employed and to pay interest on its foreign
debts N.S.W. must either export more, or
import less —it must either find work for
its people at making more things for export, or
at making more things for its people’s own use in
place of things now imported. Within the last 13
years N.S.W. has spent many millions—probably
somewhere between £12,000,000 and £20,000,000-
in trying to prop up its wool industry, in building
unprofitable railways into the sheep districts, and
in carrying the trade of the pastoral country on
these railways at a dead loss—and the result is
that the annual wool income is £1,300,000 less
than it was 13 years ago and the State is being
urged to spend another £10,000,000 of loan
money to prop up the grazing business in
the Western country. There i 3 no visible hope
of increasing exports in that direction. The iron
industry can save Australia £2,000,000 a year by
reducing imports, and that is more than the sheep
seems likely to do even if another £20,000,000 of
public money is spent on it in indirect bonuses.
* * • *
This is how things are situated now, and how
they were situated when the Bonus Bill came
before the House of Representatives. The
Representatives, on the motion of Labor-member
Watson of N.S.W., decided that no bonuses
should be paid, except on iron manufactured in
works belonging to a State Government. If the
decision had been that no bonuses should be
paid, except on iron manufactured in works
wholly, or principally, owned in Australia,
the position would be logical and commend-
able ; as it is the amendment was a short-
sighted proposition. The private Australian em-
ploying Australian capital will be penalised as
against the State Government employing English
capital—the State in this matter, under the
wretched and servile foreign loan policy, having
sunk into the position of an agent for the British
money-lender, sending all its profits abroad to
pay interest with. The State Governments may
not start the proposed iron industry at-all, but it
isn’t safe now for any private Australian to
start it, for he is always liable to be struck by
State competition, the State being aided by
Federal bonuses while he is not. Therefore, there
are likely to be no big ironworks at all. Then the
country will go on importing from Europe and
America. As regards the thousands of men who
might have found employment, it will still be
necessary to float big foreign loans so that wages
may be paid them on semi-relief works. Australia
will goon working at 15s. a week at the “natural
industry ” of tearing produce out of its sterile soil
that it may sell it cheap in a congested market at
the other end of the world to pay for its iron im-
ports. And the outback pastoral industry, which
is also, to a considerable extent, a foreign-owned
industry, will continue to cost the countrv
large sums in losses on unprofitable lines, anil
will still beg to be propped up with more aids in
the shape of irrigation works and light railways
and gratis fodder carriage and sundries.
* • * *
One argument which led the Representatives to
vote for aiding State-owned ironworks only, was
the statement of Watson, M.H.R., that there is
only room in Australia for one such establishment,
therefore to grant a bonus to any private owner
was to subsidise a monopoly. Therefore, on a
population basil, it follows that there is only room
for eight ironworks in England, for one in Scot-
land, and for in Belgium. How such a ludic-
rous statement passed muster it is difficult to
understand, but it seems to have brought a good


many votes. The rest of the anti-Government
majority consisted of the Foreign-traders, who
always seek to suppress Australian industry for
the sake of the importing gang, and who acted up
to their usual character.
• * • *
The situation now is a wildly confused one.
There is only one State Government (that of
N.S.W.) which is at all likely to start national
ironworks. The other States either lack the raw
material or their Tory Parliaments don’t take
kindly to enterprises of the kind. The N.S.W.
Government says it has no intention whatever of
starting State ironworks —probably because it
can’t borrow much more money just now. When
the Labor Party proposed terms under which any
extensive ironworks, except the State-owned
variety, are rendered a very doubtful quantity, it
seems to have made no preliminary effort to find
out whether any State felt like moving in the
matter. It didn’t stipulate that the State works
must be Australian-owned —not really the pro-
perty of a foreign money-lender; so its proposal
may ultimately work out in such a way as to
penalise the Australian capitalist for the benefit of
Cohen, of London. Meanwhile everybody seems
to have got left—except the importer. N.S.W. is
the State chiefly concerned, and N.S.W., whose
total private wealth is officially reckoned to be
£56,000,000 less than it was 10 years ago, can’t
afford to lose chances just now. Also, Australia
can’t afford to send away £2,000,000 a year to prop
up the English or American iron monopolist, to say
nothing of the fact that neither of these persons
is so very beautiful that this country should want
to sacrifice itself on his account.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Jewhannesburg Jingoes.
There is a splendid opportunity now for the
Rand Jews, who sooled Britain into the war upon
the Boers, to show their British patriotism. Eng-
land has spent her treasure and her blood in sub-
duing the Boer Government, which had incurred
the hatred of the mine-owners, but has been
obliged to stop short of absolutely exterminating
the Boer people, and to grant conditions of peace
under which the decimated Boer manhood will be
allowed to settle down in the country again, keep-
ing their arms and their horses, and securing
recognition for their laws and their language.
The only hope for British supremacy to continue
under the circumstances, is that there shall be
kept in the two conquered provinces a sufficient
number of British men to outfight the Boers in
case of a revolt, and to outvote them when
representative government is granted. Otherwise
a rebellion at any time might involve another
huge war; otherwise the Parliament of the Trans-
vaal and Orange State will be just as much a Boer
Parliament as in the days of Kruger. The Rand
mine-owners, on whose behalf the late most
unhappy war was waged, have thus in their own
hands, as the biggest employers of labor, the
opportunity of veryeffectively aiding the British
Imperialism in which they profess to believe so
sincerely. By dispensing with native labor at
their mines, and bringing a big mass of British
workers to the country, they can do enormous ser-
vice in securing the stability of British rule. And
they are doing precisely the opposite. A circular-
letter issued by the Amalgamated Society of
Engineers, Amalgamated Society of Carpenters
and Joiners, Ironmoulders’ Society of South
Africa, and Transvaal Enginedrivers and Boiler-
Attendants’ Association shows that, even before
the war had ended, action had been taken by one
of the big Transvaal mining companies to get rid of
white labor, as far as possible, and that this action
was evidently a prelude to a general movement
to impose upon the white workers at the mines
impossible conditions of labor, and thus to force
them off the Rand. Lord Milner was appealed
to by the trades-unions, but that German gentle-
man is the same sort of Imperialist as the mine-
owners, and simply “acknowledged” the appeal.
The mine-owners’ paper (the only one which
military authority has allowed to re-start in
Johannesburg) refuses to allow the trades-unions
to even state their case, or to warn workers abroad
that a strike is on, through its columns. The
Rand mine-owners seem likely to succeed in the
attempt to drive the British population off the
fields, that is to say in doing their utmost to increase
England’s difficulties of administration. If the
English Cabinet were not dominated by the
capitalistic gang it would meet the situation by
Eassing a law forbidding the employment of any
ut white British subjects on the Rand.
4
The Gospel of Helplessness and
Cowardice.
The vigorous opposition of the House of Repre-
sentatives to the Federal Government’s loan
proposals led to an outbreak of strange, shocked
language on the part of some of Australia’s
“great” dailies. The House of Representatives
was the first Australian Legislative Chamber to
set its face against the dishonest and ruinous
policy of paying out of loans for temporary works,
for works that yield no revenue, for repairs and
patches, and for the replacement of worn-out un-
dertakings which had also been charged to loans
in former years. It is a policy which has already
gone a long way to ruin Australia—this bright,
new, almost empty land from which people are
now fleeing to South Africa in such haste. The
Commonwealth already pays about £2,000,000 a
year in interest on debts which are represented by
no productive assets whatever—agreatpartof them
by no assets at all, productive or unproductive;
and this burden, which is now increasing faster
than it ever did before, is already far heavier in
proportion to population than the total debt of
Europe. And this is how the Federal Parlia-
ment’s effort at reform —the first serious attempt
at honest finance made in recent years by any
Australian Legislature—was greeted by the
“great ” Sydney Freetrade press
Sooner or later the Commonwealth must borrow money,
it is true. It may be that it is essential for the inevitable
beginning to be made now. But cautiousness in this
regard is so infrequent among Australian politicians that
the display of it which is being made in the Federal Par-
liament will doubtless be generally hailed with satisfac-
tion, and with a feeling that if an error has been made in
selecting the occasion, it is an error on the right side. —
Sydney Telegraph.
There is a natural hesitation in view of all the circum-
stances of State and Federal finances, and also in view of
the rapid progress of Australian indebtedness, to begin
another spirited public works policy for the Common-
wealth. On the other side we have the plea of George
Turner, a man whose whole personal and official record
is that of a sound safe financier, that the Federal Admin-
istration has taken over services which will require re-
newal and, maintenance, and so a certain loan expendi-
ture. The Parliament is right unquestionably in assert-
ing an economical spirit towards ordinary and loan expen-
diture ; that is a good example, and will reap a reward in
public ’confidence. But as there must be a loan policy at
some time not remote, it should be met with no doctrin-
aire resistance. —S.M. Herald.
These are the two papers which preach economy
in the abstract, and which hounded out of office
George Dibbs, the only N.S.W. Premier in this
generation who practised that virtue. They lay
down the law that the Commonwealth must bor-
row, not only for new works, whether productive
or otherwise, but for renewal and maintenance
—for keeping the unpaid-for public works in re-
pair and for replacing the unpaid-for “asset,
when it wholly disappears, with another unpaid-
for asset. They hold that when the twelve-and-
sixpenny boots have been paid for out of loans,
and have been twice soled and heeled (3s. 9d. each
time) out of loans, the worn-out pair, when its
usefulness has finally departed, is still good
security for the debt of 20s. then accumulated
upon it. Then two new boots will be bought
with 12s. 6d. of loan money, and the Sydney
Freetrade dailies hold that they are a good
and sufficient asset to represent a debt of
,£1 12s. 6d. —their own price and the price
of their dead and gone predecessors. In other
words they hold that it is quite wrong to make
provision out of income for depreciation and wear
and tear of assets. And they both stick closely to
the old, lazy, cowardly theory that the Common-
wealth must start to build up a new debt —
that the fact that the Australian is too poor and
helpless and miserable to pay for his own repairs
is so self-evident that it only requires to be
stated, and it is superfluous to give reasons.
After this helpless Freetrade drivel it is pleasant
to turn to the Protectionist Age on ■ the same
subject and read its doctrince of self reliance :
It ought not to be necessary for the House of Repre-
sentatives to spend so large an amount of its time in
discussing the question whether the repairs and renewals
to perishable public works are properly charged to loan
account. This, as we pointed out a few days ago, is the
real point involved in the consideration of the Federal
Treasurer’s proposal to borrow a million sterling imme-
diately, and half a million annually in the future, for such
purposes as the renewal of telegraph poles and wires, the
replacing of old telephone switchboards by new ones, and
the putting of certain wires in cities underground instead
of overhead. If George Turner in the Federal Parlia-
ment should make a frequent practice of resorting to
such specious arguments on finance as those which he has
employed on this subject, it is to be feared that he will
soon lose in the Commonwealth Legislature the reputa-
tion for cautious financing which he had at one time
established in Victoria. Some of the lines on the schedule
to his Loan Bill are just as flagrant a violation of all
principles of sound finance as the case which has been
cited of the Railway Department renewing and re-
pairing its engines out of borrowed funds, so that in
course of time the State became indebted for four
engines where it only had one to show as an asset against
its liability. These lines, indeed, represent just the same
tendency towards profligate finance. which in private
enterprise is exhibited in the temptation, to which direc-
tors of companies sometimes succumb, and for which they
render themselves liable to punishment, when they pay
dividends out of capital or utilise borrowed money for
the purpose of bolstering up their revenue. Possibly, for
example, it may be proved to be advisable to spend some
£73,000 in removing the existing telephone switchboards
and replacing them by more modern instruments. This
is a matter on which the Treasurer has evidently been
well coached by his officers. But if he really believes
that the work will prove to be eminently remunerative
from a financial standpoint, why does he not give an
earnest of his conviction by relying upon the increased
telephone revenue to enable him to wipe out the debt in
a very short time ?
Australia wants more of that kind of language
and much less of the Herald and Telegraph
sort.
O
An Unanswerable Argument.
As part of the price of the S’African war, the
Chamberlain Government in England has to face
what seems an unanswerable argument from the
Irish Home Rule Party. Supporters of that
movement in Sydney have, in reviving their
agitation, pointed out that Home Rule has been
promised to the Boers by England as one of the
terms of peace, and that, consequently, there can
be no logical reason why it should not be promptly
granted to the Irish. This way of putting it may
not have originated in Sydney; it may be the text
for speakers on the same subject in the old world
at tne present moment. But whether it is
peculiar to Sydney now, or not, it is inevitable
that in a few months it will be in the mouths
of every Home Rule advocate. What answer
there can be to it, is hard to guess. The
Irish, like the Boers, have an overwhelming
majority in favor of Home Rule. Like the Boers
they claim that there are matters which only a
local Parliament can administer properly. The
only difference between the two peoples is that
the Boers have fought in the field to gain their
Home Rule, and the Irish have remained more or
less peaceable and trusted to Parliamentary agita-
tion, and even assisted in quelling the Boers’
Home Rule war. If, then, the Boer gets what he
wants and the Irishman doesn’t, the dangerous
conclusion will come to the latter that he is re-
fused because he doesn’t put the issue to battle
arbitrament. True, he has battled in the past,
and, owing greatly to his own internecine
jealousies, has battled very badly, and come out of
the conflict beaten. But it will be a very strong
encouragement to him to have another try now if
he sees the Boer enjoying Home Rule whilst he,
the friend and ally of England in S’Africa, is
refused that right of self-government. A wise
Cabinet will stop any Irish meditations on this
point by promptly convening a Parliament at
Dublin.

Irvine’s Reform.
Victorian Premier Irvine has announced his
Erogramme, which proves to be, on the whole,
etter than might have been expected, considering
the composition of his Ministry. He promises to
reduce the Legislative Council to 28 members and
the Assembly to 66. It would be a vast amount
better if the Council were abolished altogether,
but Australia hasn’t climbed sufficiently out of the
old furrow to adopt that simple and sensible idea.
Members’ salaries are to be left at the present
figure—which is good. Ministers’ salaries are to
be reduced—which is darned foolishness. The
idea that the best men in the country will devote
themselves to the precarious trade of politics, and
carry the stupendous burden of running the
country as it should be run, for about the salary
of a branch bank manager, ought to be exploded
by this time, considering the kind of men that
are obtained for the money. Irvine also _ pro-
mises general economy, which is a beneficent
idea, even if it is a little hackneyed from
futile repetition. But the great point of his
programme is that he promises to attempt the
drastic reform of the dreadful House of 48 Rich
Landlords. At present there are 130,000 electors
for the Vic. Upper House, of whom only 2000
are eligible, by reason of the property qualifica-
tion, to sit in their own Chamber. The other
128,000 are rejected, unclean, and politically
leprous and outcast, unfit to associate with the
members they themselves create, and haughtily
booted out by their own alleged servants and dele-
gates. Premier Irvine (who, in these matters,
has practically annexed Peacock’s policy) pro-
poses that every person who has a vote for the
Council shall be qualified to sit in that body,
which is a simple and logical proposition, and one
that the Council can’t reject without declaring,
even more openly than usual, that the bulk of its
constituents are mentally or morally unfit. And
that declaration, of course, would cast grave
doubts on the mental oapacity of the Upper House,
as a body selected by persons of bad character or
deficient intelligence. But, all the same, the House
of Landlords, which isn’t strong on logic, will
probably reject the proposed abbreviation of its
absurd privileges if it gets a fair opportunity to do
so, and if Irvine is the political delusion that
he is in some quarters suspected of being, there
is one way in which he can supply the oppor-
tunity and yet pose as a man who is really
yearning after reform. If his proposals are
all put in one Bill, and the Assembly de-
mands the whole Bill and nothing less, then
the Upper House may reform itself rather than
accept the obloquy of throwing out the reduction
of members proposals at a time when the
propertied classes are taking the reduction ques-
tion rather seriously. If two separate Bills are
sent up the Council will pass the one with the
reduction of members in it, and reject the one for
the abolition of its precious property qualification.
And the Kyabram programme crowd, having got
its reduction of members, will cheerfully acquiesce
in the rejection, and Irvine will probably do like-
wise to please the Kyabramites, and then appeal to
the democratic party for its support on the ground
that he tried his alleged best to reform the House
of Landlords but failed. If Irvine splits his reform
scheme into two Bills, then it may be fairly
assumed that Irvine is a humbug, playing for the
democratic vote by professing to try to reform the
House of Landlords and for the Kyabram vote by
carefully failing in the attempt. If he puts them
in one Bill, and stakes the life of his Ministry on
that Bill in its entirety, then Irvine may be
reasonably suspected of being a genuine, honest,
and capable reformer.
The Bunkum of Bevan.
A letter from Queensland :
Preacher Bevan has just made what the Brisbane
Courier (June 7) calls “a delightful journey” through
N.Q., and has given to the world his opinions on the
Northern alien question. Some patches :
As far as I could see— of course, I was only able to
look at it from the standpoint of the employer— Kanaka
labor is exceedingly useful, and I don’t see the perils, etc.
. . , I think the evils of colored labor are greatly
exaggerated. . . . With regard to mortality and health,
I was told that; the health of the men was sometimes
poor when they came . . . and that, in many cases, they
were in a sickened condition when they arrived.”
Doesn’t Dr. Bevan know that the employment of
Kanakas of defective physique and sickened condition is
not allowed, and that the Health Officer is supposed to
prevent their landing ? However, the planters told him,
and they ought to know.
Dr. Bevan, further, visited the Jap. and Chinese
quarters of Cairns, and found them “ fairly clean and in
good condition. The inmates seemed fairly clean, and
he was told that, on the whole, they were a very peaceful,
law-abiding community ”... A little further on he
admitted that municipal laws re sanitation and over-
crowding were frequently broken, so that the rev. gentle-
man’s idea of what “ fairly clean ” signifies seems a bit
loose. And this is how the worthy doctor hits off recent
Kanaka and anti-alien legislation :
“ It would be the maddest thing in the world in the case
of a part of the country whose conditions of labor and life
are so different to the Southern States to apply the same
principles to conditions so utterly different as those in
N.Q., and it would show a great lack of statesmanship on
the part of the Government to compel the North Queens-
lander to come under the action of laws similar to those
in the South.”
Is Dr. Bevan unaware that at the Federal election
this black labor question was the test question
throughout Queensland, and that that country de-
cided by its choice of Reps, to come under
the action of these very laws he mentions ? Moreover,
Queensland was not compelled by the Government to
come under objectionable anti-alien legislation, but, as a
matter of fact, the Q. Federal members (very largely)
compelled the Barton Ministry to introduce that same
legislation to satisfy the anti-alien feeling in Bananaland.
. . . But what can you expect from parsons of the Bevan
type, who spend “ their afternoons on Hambledon plan-
tation in the society of Dr. Reid, the super., ana Mr.
D* Moleyns, brother of Lady Hopktoun ” ? The founder
of the religion Dr. Bevan professes would have put in the
day among the Kanakas—but that’s another story.

The Customs officers, in Melbourne, in carrying
out the Aliens Restriction Act, are just now
grappling with the case of Ditta Fatha, which
murky citizen, with the assistance of certain
honorariums at Port Melbourne, seems to be in
the way of doing Australia a good turn without
intending it. Ditta was captured just as the
mailboat China was leaving port, and, instead of
being unceremoniously bundled back, was care-
fully taken ashore and locked up as a deserter and
a restricted alien. He knew no English but “No
sabby,” the rest of his vocabulary being Pun-
jaubee. An interpreter tackled him, but all he
could make out was that Ditta had come to Mel-
bourne, in a British-India boat, two months ago.
He didn’t know her name, nor could he say
where he had stayed meanwhile. Also, none of
the other Melb. Hindus knew anything of him.
He was remanded as a deserter from the China,
and the beaks were then invited to give him six
months, as a restricted alien, for the benefit of his
health, so that, when the China came back, he
could be shipped away again. But the Bench
reckoned four weeks a fair thing, so, unless he is
remanded for another four months or so, he will
simply fade away when his time is up, and the
owners of the China, being unable to produce
him, will be under the necessity of capturing some
other dark heathen to personate him, or of paying
£lO0 —that is, if the Department administering
the Act means business. The “honoraries,” in
putting their feet through the Aliens Restriction
Act, seem to have accidentally kicked a wealthy
friend who was sitting behind the said law.

Treasurer Bird, of Tasmania, recently hinted at
a public meeting that his Government had a
scheme of “equitable taxation” up its sleeve,
whereby some £50,000 per annum would be raised
to partly meet the deficit. To hear Bird, who is
usually a Jeremiah and a most gloomy fowl
generally, say such things in a hopeful tone of
voice, was so much of a surprise that people felt
justified in expecting something serious to happen.
Landlords viewed the situation seriously, and the
daily papers solemnly stressed the sacredness of
vested interests, and pointed out the grave danger
of taxing the land and capital that produces the
wages fund, and trusted that nothing would be
done to hamper the operations of Private Enter-
prise, or cool the ardor of the British Investor.
Just what was going to happen no one could feiy,
but all were dead certain that drastic measures
were contemplated. Then, just as the island was
ready to explode under its burden of anxiety, it
was announced that, as the farmers had had a
fairly good season, railway freights were to be
increased 2i, or some such sum, per cent. Trea-
surer Bird had better be careful. If he persists
in firing off these violent threats of reform right
in the ear of his sleeping country, he is recklessly
fooling with Fate. For, sure enough, some of
thesedays Tasmania will grow savage at having
its rest needlessly disturbed and do something
desperate. Then Bird will need to fly.

Victoria’s Commission to inquire into the
Greater Melbourne scheme got to work the other
day. The inquiry creates so little interest that
only three of the Commission turned up, and, if
the evidence they got is a sample of what is to
follow, even those three might as well have
stayed away. The two witnesses examined were
one Callaghan (representing the A.N.A.). and a
councillor named voice, appearing for himself.
The Native’s scheme was truly marvellous in its
complexity. It provided fora “ judicious amal-
gamation ” of the existing 24 councils into about
10; over these there would be a “ Central Council,”
elected on a one-man-one-municipal-vote basis,
which would control water, light, sewerage, trams,
fire, health, parks, harbor, cemeteries, housing of
the poor, and roads and bridges. Also there was to
be a consolidation of loans —‘‘which would lead
to a considerable saving.” It was a nice scheme,
and it was a pity the A.N.A. should have wasted
so much time on it only to have it knocked sky-
high by a brutally plain-spoken Commissioner,
who inquired what the small councils would have
to look after. The answer was—“ Footpaths,
drains, and such small matters.” If the A.N.A.
thinks a dozen or so councils, town-clerks, rate-
collectors, engineers, treasurers, and mayoral
allowances are needed to look after footpaths, then
that body has grievously miscalled itself. It
should be re-christened the Australian Noodles’
Ass.
Even Labor-leader Watson, of N.S.W., who led
the opposition to the Federal Loan Bill, had an
apology to make for the borrowing-disease. He is
thus reported :
For such matters as the transcontinental railway, and
locking and weiring the Darling, both of which had been
mooted, it would be absurd to expect any one year’s
revenue to provide for them, and loans would have to be
raised. (Hear, hear 1)
If anyone proposed to build, or could build, the
transcontinental line in one year it might strain
the revenue a good deal. But as the work would
certainly take a good many years the logic isn’t
so apparent as it might be.

The first appearance of N.S.W. Country Party in
practical politics took the shape of a demand that
the State should spend £200,000 a year in water
conservation in the West, interspersed with
another suggestion that it should borrow
£10,000,000 in one heap for the same purpose.
Yet water conservation alone wouldn’t make the
grass grow—even if there was a huge dam every
10 miles. The soil between, in the absence of rain
or irrigation, might be as bare of feed as a gallows.
And one large iron-works, which wouldn’t require
half as much State aid to set it going, would em-
ploy twice as many people as does the whole western
pastoral industry. The only difference would be that
where all this aid to the western pastoral industry
might enable Australia to sell £1,000,000 worth
more wool, a mere fraction of the assistance given
to the iron industry might enable Australia to buy
£1,000,000 worth less metal work. The Freetrade
party isquite willing to spend hundredsof thousands,
or even millions, in developing the allegedly “na-
tural resources of the country ” in the way of
growing an exotic animal, the sheep or bullock, in
a howling desert. But when it is proposed to
spend a fraction of the amount in developing the
really natural resources in the shape of the
N.S.W. iron deposits, that is simply anathema.
And the same people who stipulate that no public
money must be spent to develop the iron industry
unless it is State-owned don’t mind spending a
vast amount more of State money to develop the
privately-owned cow and sheep industry. Why
these things should be so Heaven only knows,
but' they are.

N.S.W. Premier See has once more got off the
old explanation that the early morning trains on
which the Sydney Herald and Telegraph are
carried gratis into the country show a profit,
therefore there is nothing to complain of about
the goods of those wealthy concerns going free.
It is a plausible explanation in a small way, yet
if the writer were found on John See’s steamboat
without a ticket, and he explained that he should
travel gratis because even then the boat would
make a profit, the John See concern would
assuredly put him in gaol. Anyhow, the N.S.W.
railways as a whole make a serious loss, and that
is what the country has to consider. Also, it is
ten to one that the “newspaper train” only
shows a profit by not being debited with its share
of the annual interest bill—that it shows a profit
over and above working costs only. Even if this
is not so, the questions arise: (1) Is it a rule that,
when one train shows a profit and thereby
threatens to do something towards reducing
the general railway deficit, something or
somebody should be carried for nothing
on that train so as to reduce or obliterate
the profit? (2) If so, why should the Herald
and Telegraph be the gratis persons every time
and all the time —especially considering the well-
known objections of these papers to the
“coddling” of any industry at public expense?
(3) If these trains pay, why do the Railway
Commissioners refuse to run them unless the
loss is made good by a subsidy, and why
was the Federal Postal Department applied
to for a grant of £2500 a year to make good the
loss, and why did the old State Postal Depart-
ment pay that sum ?
No sooner had the HARE-brained system of voting
been scotched in the Federal Parliament than
another wildly-complicated plan of “electoral
reform ” was sprung upon the public—the Wood
system. The chief points to be gleaned about
this system, from an exhaustive study of its
“explanation,” are that the vote is to be treated
as money, which the voter must deposit and get a
pass-book for; then the voter signs a form de-
manding his vote ; he gets that, and some printed
numerals also—quite a lot of printed numerals, in
fact—and he juggles with them somehow and
votes, and then —
The Points, as seen, increase in proportion as the can-
didates increase.
If two are standing, 1 point over the half would bo
successful, viz., 16.
Similarly, if three, 1 point over the third, and so on.
Where 4, 7,10, or any number are standing, the result
is thus as proportionate as if only two were standing.
each result is. qn EXHAUSTIVE RE-
SULT, and the same as a Ballot' st ’ONLY two to
determine the best of those two.
Isn’t that quite simple? If it isn’t, and the
reader doesn’t quite see how it will save the
country, he is recommended to read the whole
weird explanatory pamphlet (16 pages with
1,973,684,202 figures). It is truly wonderful that,
in this large, raw country, with its raw politics,
so much time should be wasted in devising
systems of vQting which can only be understood
after six months study by a Senior Wrangler in
Mathematics.
The members of the rival Sydney art societies are
to be congratulated on having settled their differ-
ences, just as the wolf was clamoring at the door.
It remains yet to be seen whether the public is to
be congratulated. Probably it would have been
better had the two bodies continued to quarrel and
thus thrown upon the State the necessity of
making other arrangements in re art education.
The system adopted in Victoria of a National Art
school under a competent instructor, who is clear
of all local jealousies, has worked infinitely better

An audience, partly shocked, but, never-
theless, enthusiastic, gathered at the Sydney
Criterion, last Saturday, to see the most daring
drama on a religious subject that has yet been
presented. Miss Maud Williamson has improved
Mane Corelli’s hysterical outburst, but rather too
much of the heroine’s madness still remains in the
last act or two. It is insanity of considerable
merit; but one can have too much madness
on the stage, however artistically rendered.
Biblical events are alluded to and Biblical
characters introduced in a manner that
made the . sparse hair of the clergymen
present rise in horror; but the clergymen them-
selves did not rise in horror, and the large, eager
boot of episcopal approval was heard thudding
cheerily when the Great Earthquake scene
resolved itself into half the scenery going up and
the other half tumbling down. To soothe Chris-
tian susceptibilities, most of the characters are
given fictitious names. Judas Iscariot is called
Demas. In the absence of evidence to the
contrary, Judas may as well be a gentle,
serious young man with pale hair, and good
intentions as any other sort of person. Also,
there is nothing to disprove that Barabbas may
not have been a handsome young person in a black
velvet cloak, who robs by proxy and murders
from the most honorable motives. The Bulletin
is pleased to accept Barabbas as a nice, clean,
toney robber, and considers that he reflects credit
on the criminal classes of old Judea. None of the
disciples are introduced on the stage, except Peter,
who is spok< n of as Petrus, and is represented as
being of a cantankerous disposition. He trails in
on every possible occasion clutching his gloomy
robes to his chest, rebuking people for their
alleged sin, and getting snubbed by every bright,
spangled Pagan for his pains. Petrus is the*only
definite Christian -that appears, and he doesn’t
heal the sick or comfort the sorrowing at all. The
spangled heathen does all that after he has told
Petrus what he honestly thinks of him, and
ordered that ill-dressed and bad-tempered apostle
off the boards. The spectacular effects of this
. drama are to be commended, also some of the
scenery, though it- would be better if Nereus
didn’t die on marble steps that sound wooden. It
would be more effective, also, if the knife
Miriam drops down , the well didn’t knock hard
against the. stage flooring. Wells are not supposed
to have wooden floors near the top.
*.* / * *
. As an affectionate sister of Judas Iscariot, Miss
Maud Williamson acts with artistic finish. Judith
is a sinful lady with no obvious reason for being
sinful, and sh o becomes.converted to Christianity
m an irrelevant and motiveless manner, but Miss
. Williamson presents her jus ably as possible, and
looks her character better than in any previous
play. Alf. Woods, as: Barabbas, melts from one
graceful attitude into another. He poses well, but
too obviously, and one would like, a larger robber
for one’s money. Miss May Hesford does good
work in a trying part, and Mr. Leo de Chatean
causes some crude humor by coming up from a well.
Miss Hardinge Maltby, as the wife of Pontius
Pilate (here called Tiberius), has possibilities, but
spoils her pathetic effects by inartistic stragglings
with'her veil or train, while Harry Douglas, as a
well-intentioned but worried Pontius Pilate,
inspires the audience with strong sentiments of
sympathy. The audience feels almost as sorry for
Pontius as it does for Judas. He seems to have
the whole Tower of Siloam weighing on his mind.

Charles 11., the king who reigned frivol-
ously in a backwash period of English history,
has grown to be a favorite at Sydney Royal, and
Nell Gwynne, as pourtrayerl by Nellie Stewart,
is beloved by all who have seen her. Historv
speaks bitterly of Charles 11., but it is possible
that he was a necessary evil. England had spent
a dozen years in strenuous fighting, in intense
gioom, m suppressing all amusement, in reading
the Old Testament bitterly through its nose and
in tying a brick to the kitten’s tail on Saturday
night lest it should chase that appendage on Sun-
day. It wanted a restful and unprincipled drunk
as it never wanted one before, and Charles II
the embodiment of a butterfly drunk arrived
at the psychological moment, like the shadow of
*-»- f? reat co °l beer in a dry land. If he hadn’t
arrived, and the old order of things had remained,
t 7 ] countr y had gone on reading Jeremiah
through its nose for 40 years more, it would either
have gone mad or its nose would have worn out
*. * * *
The leading characters in “Sweet Nell of Old
Drury were duly noticed last week. Among the
smaller' ones Lord Rochester is especially dis-
appointing. Webster Lawson does about all that
ca *\ be reasonably expected with him, but the
author had no right to make that famous wit a
mere dancing fool and animated clothes-horse.
Rochester, Sedley (the gentleman who tried to
harangue the people of London in a nude state
and was driven away with road metal), and
the rest of Charles’s hangers-on were mostly
men who had a bright epigram in one hand
and the other in a friend’s pocket, and a
person who made such frightful verses as
does the Earl in the drama appears an
anachronism. Alfred Tapping, as a broken-down
Hamlet trying to borrow a drink, is an especially
clever study. The good girl of the play, Miss
Minnie Sadler, is pale and beautiful, and does her
part nicely in a statuesque sort of way : and
Ixordon Bailey is a sturdy, handsome hero in
a serious hind of fashion. They were both
Dood, and good people were mostly under
a cloud just then. They had forgotten how
to laugh in Cromwell’s time, and the bad
people, mostly exiled Cavaliers, had brought
back with them from France a sneering
cackle which was of no use to the good people.
In fact there was hardly any kind of laugh in
court circles that they could use. The two sub-
ordinate bad women, Lady Castlemaine and the
Duchess of Portsmouth, have little to do but look
beautiful and be crushed by Nell Gwynne. Miss
Alice Farleigh looks beautiful and Mrs. John
Bandes looks lovely, and beyond that nothing
much happens. ‘ bweet Nell ” should have a good
run ; a drama with a king in it is apt to be popular
at this Coronation season. Yet kings are sup-
posed even yet to reign by some kind of divine
right, and if so Charles and his dog are a direct
impeachment of Edward Vll.’s title to the throne.
I here are still descendants of the family of the
royal dog-bearer who occupy small thrones—mere
inverted kerosene tins—here and there about
Europe, and who would probably like to argue
the point with the well-nourished monarch who,
if all goes well, puts on his crown this Thursday.
** * *
‘ In London Town ” conies to a finish at
Sydney Lyceum at the end of this week, and on
Saturday there will be presented to Coronation
visitors a sensation of a different sort—“ The
Great Ruby.” It is described as a “great melo-
dramatic achievement,” which is highly probable.
It is also alleged to be a perfectly feasible and
possible series, of incidents, and if it proves
to be so it _ will be _ a novelty, but probably
the remark is only intended to be taken in
a stage sense. In the mild and possible melo-
drama we generally find a woman fleeing at mid-
night on a telegraph wire with her child in her
arms, or a policeman revoking the Judge’s sen-
tence of 14 years’ penal servitude, and telling the
wronged hero, casually, beside a lamp-post, that
he may now consider himself a free man. That is
the possible drama. In the impossible one any-
thing is liable to happen.
** * *
further impressions of “ Facing the
Music,” at Sydney Palace, familiarity having
somewhat modified laughter over its complica-
tions, allow one to notice that in the lady princi-
pals Mr. Thornton has two very charming Misses.
Miss Fordyce, in addition to her personal attrac-
tions, ants with grace and briskness. Miss Nor-
bury (as the Curate’s wife) is, however, either
naturally stiff and amateurish, or else gives that
impression as her artistic idea of what Mrs. (Rev )
John Smith would be like. There has been no
lessening in the public appreciation of the comedy,
and accordingly no change of bill is yet sug-
gested.

There has been a much-needed strengthen-
ing of the bill at Sydney Tivoli this week.
Callahan and Mack made a welcome reappearance
on Monday night in a new sketch, which was not
a very marked variant on the old one. The
Florenz co. of Italian acrobats now contribute a
“turn,” which is one of the best of its kind seen in
Sydney. The well-known Craggs are outdone in
business which is very much of the same character,
because the Florenz co. has as one of its chief per-
formers a lady whose fair shoulders are quite
equal to catching and supporting a flying Florenz
or two; and there is further a wonderfully
clever little boy, and a mannikin who adds
to his agility a good deal of humour.
A very interesting archaeological sketch is now
being given in the form of a recitation by Mr.
Barney Fagan. The incident described took
place in the year 98 (presumably the first century
of the Christian era), and the locality was a coun-
try known as Oireland. Two young men, found
guilty of rebellion, are about to be sentenced to
death when their mother rises and argues the case
with the Judge (who is named A 1 Annah). In
accordance with the curious judicial methods of
the day, Judge A 1 Annah offers to let off one of
the prisoners if the mother will choose between
them. She does so, and condemns to death her
own son, saving the other who was her foster son
(and possibly earned the bigger salary of the two).
I his choice by her seems to have been equivalent
to a full verdict of acquittal, and both prisoners
were discharged. As an explanation of methods
of justice in a remote and little known period,
Professor Barney Fagan’s lecture is of some
interest.

Seems to be almost settled that Melba
will make her first, if not tier only, appearances in
her native city at the Princess’s Theatre.
Probable prices, £2, £l, 10s. and ss. In the
ordinary way of business the Great Singer and
Tactican will naturally wish to adopt the easiest
means of scoring, say, a grand total of from eight
to ten thousand pounds in Melbourne. The
handsome theatre should serve her purpose better
than the chilly Town Hall. Foli, in the days of
yore, sang at the Princess’s with only moderate
results but the elderly basso was a different
matter to Melba. Besides, he was not at all well
managed. He came and sang and went away
before two per cent of the Australian multitude
had learned that he was an Irishman born under
the name of Foley.

Now is the cold, heartless season when
Melbourne shows wither quickly, and die young.
Fven “ The King of Crime,” at the Royal, is
already nearing the end of its revival, although
the weather seems calculated to drive people to
that generous feast of horrors. “The King of
Crime ” is a full-blooded melodrama, with a pur-
pose. The hero, being a man of many murders,
takes an early opportunity to explain that nothing
stands between him and a blameless future, except
the police, who would inevitably hunt him down
if he attempted to follow his natural instincts, and
retire from business. Therefore he commits a
new murder in a casual way, after which a
mean, contemptible nephew betrays him to the
bloodhounds of the Law, and, as the royal
hero’s religion is particularly rough on traitors,
he takes pains to assassinate the vile nephew
before going to join his late blind wife in Heaven,
lhe one thing wanting in “ The King of Crime ”
is a final apotheosis picture, showing the name-
part character en route to Realms Above, sup-
ported by Bill Sikes and Jack Sheppard at either
end of the cloud. His earthly demise, with lime-
light on his brow, is an inspiring thing as far as it
goes, but it doesn’t carry the gentleman’s glorious
career, to a logical conclusion. Friday will be the
last night of the traitor’s doom, and the trusty
Brotherhood, and the barber whom Bert Bailey
stiffens in his wrath. On Saturday the Anderson
management will produce “My jack,” a tale of
the rolling sea, in five roaring acts. As this also
will be for only a limited number of nights,
Eatrons of nautical drama are desired to get there
efore the tide runs out.

“Florodora” had a boornsome-looking
resurrection at Her Majesty’s on Saturday, so
probably the short winter season on the gaudy
island of Gilfain will prove as prosperous as could
be expected. A good many new faces have been
introduced into “Florodora” since the beginning-
of its record run, 18 months ago, but the general
effect of the double sestet is not less bright for the
changes, whilst the-.principals, with one exception,
are the same people who bore the heat and burden
of a fourteen weeks’ success. Moreover, one of
them—Carrie Moore—is a distinct improvement
on her earlier self. The rested Carrie shows better
style in her dressing and make-up, and more
charm, with less apparent effort, than of yore.
Harold Thorley, the new baritone, doesn’t threaten
to shift Brownlow’s image from the mind of the
local girl. Thorley is not a particular vocal
triumph, and, although he looks the part passably
enough, lie strikes one as being very like a chemist
who has drifted into a musical comedy.
** * *
At the Opera House, public taste for
entertainment of the highest class grows steadily.
Tom Nawn’s convincing picture of an Irish-
American parent in two phases of beer is still a
respected feature of the bill, and the smartly-
written comedy which brought Mr. and Mrs.
Drew to light has established them as popular
character performers. Cassandra Alcibiades and
the dam dawg are going to be quoted on many
honeymoon occasions in this young and insuf-
ficiently married country. And the future bride-
groom whose Cassandra’s temper is not above
suspicion will be likely to get a letter from Uncle
David—fine old chap, Uncle David ! —advising
him to “let her have her head until she’s winded,
then collar her .in the straight.” Last Saturday
was the first afternoon and evening of Maccann,
the Concertina King, at Rickards’s establis' ment.
King Maccann played the plebeian . instrument
right royally when his matinee turn fell due. The
concertina, under his beneficent sway, became a
beautiful human voice, and a trumpet solo, and
various sounds of music. But, ere nightfall, Mac-
cann got overtaken by lumbago, or some other
kingly complaint, which reduced his manly stride
to a ludicrous shuffle, and made him such a very
unsatisfactory monarch that Rickards, the
paramount Emperor, requested him to come off.
So Maccann went off, like a damp firework, leaving
the tickled audience in ignorance of his real
ability. Why is exceptional musical talent sub-
ject to lumbago ?

The Cosgrove Dramatic Co. burst forth at
the little Gaiety Theatre (Melb.) last Saturday
evening in their professedly sensational drama of
“Sapho.” Perhaps the present performance is
rather more hopelessly incapable than the
“ Sapho ” that excited derision in Sydney a few
weeks back, and perhaps it isn’t. Anyway, the
company seems quite suitable to the drama, and
the orchestra harmonised with both. john
Cosgrove is the plump gentleman who falls
from grace in Gay Paree. A Miss Cresswell
Brandt pipes the lines of the heroine in
pale falsetto tones, Tom Cosgrove frivols
up and down the agony in an unbreeched
state, and a gentleman standing 6ft. 6in., more or
less, brings his undisciplined legs to bear upon
sundry situations where Sapho’s happiness is
concerned. In the end, this vast stretch of
humanity mixes a fatal dose for the lady, remark-
ing that poison is the proper treatment for females
who cannot be trusted, and, when she has accepted
the physic from the hand of her cheeild and swal-
lowed it in mistake for a pick-me-up, she dies the
dismal death of an amateur tragedienne, whilst
lier plump lover and the man with the obtrusive
legs gather round her dissolution. Somebody who
plays the friend and moral adviser of Cosgrove is
a fairly promising actor, but the rival merits of
mummers in a low-down show are not worth look-
ing for. Speaking fine and large, “ Sap ho ” is an
uncalled-for affront.

At the Bijou (where Salerno, Bunth-cum-
Rudd, and Miss Violet Elliott have been received
with thanks for an unbroken series of we ks) the
latest additions to the programme are people who
went away quite recently, and came back before
they were missed. On second thoughts this scribe
withdraws the previous rem irk as r. g rds Allan
Shaw and Flatt and Sutherland. T eir absence
was not nearly so brief as some of the other
absences. On Thursday, the two performances at
the Bijou will be embellished with a Coronation
Tableau, representing Henry Lee the Seventh in
all his glory, supported by Queen Alexandra, and
splendid electrical effects, including the Grace of
Heaven, one supposes. Miss Violet Elliott, by the
way, ought to make a satisfactory resemblance to
Queen Alexandra.

At the Princess’s the last nights of “Thirty
Thieves” will be continued up, to Saturday,
therefore the forthcoming musical comedy—“ A
Chinese Honeymoon ” —will not forthcome until
Monday, June 30th. Rumor credits “A
Chinese Honeymoon” with numerous virtues.
It is the tale of a European couple, who
toured bridally to the Pekin district, taking
their Lady Slavey in tow, when the Slavey
wasn’t towing them. George Dance wrote
the book, and Dance’s effort was sufficiently
humorous to keep the show going for some hun-
dreds of nights in London, New Fork and other
foreign parts. Musgrove’s co. will be reinforced
by Miss Cissy Niel, a soubrette, and Henry Hallam
in the light tenor part. Edward Lauri takes a
large, fat share in the proceedings; also Miss May
Beatty, herewith denominated the Alice Leainar
of Australia, will let herself go as the Lady'
Slavey.

The Broughs, always popular in Adelaide,
had a most enthusiastic farewell on making their
final appearance at the Royal. They were im-
mediately followed by the Waldorf co., which
opened in “Twelfth Night,” apparently its best
show. The house took it as it was intended by
the players, and laughed uproariously every time
Sir Andrew and Sir Toby fell down and got up
again. Nobody seemed to have known before
that Shakespeare was such an amoosin’ little cuss.
But the Shakespeare Society, which attended in
force, was slightly scandalised. A new play has
followed every second or third evening, mostly the
Bard, but with “ Camille ” and others for a
change. The critics simply won’t have Miss
Waldorf’s Juliet, but commend her highly in
comedy. H. H. Vincent had a great welcome
back. At the Tivoli “ The Mr. W right ”
fills the somewhat limited space there is to till
without any trouble.
After The Bulletin had gone to press this
week the news of the serious illness of King
Edward VII. came to hand. The cables seem
to suggest that he is suffering from appen-
dicitis, or some kindred trouble. All the Coro-
nation arrangements will now be cancelled,
except those in regard to the feasting of the poor,
which, by the King’s command, stand good.
With sympathy for the King will be mingled ad-
miration for the plucky way in which he has
evidently endeavored to bear up against a serious
malady until after the Coronation.
London Anglican Church Times lately
gave a reverential account of a sacred dance per-
formed before the altar in Seville cathedral* by
six boys, every Easter. This ceremonial is quite
unique in the Catholic Church.
The scathing remarks made by Judge
Cohen in N.S.W. Arbitration Court about rule
57 of the Australian W orkers’ Union were quite
justified. That rule sets forth that any member
working against or voting against the selected
Labor candidate would be fined £3. The assump-
tion of a right to know for which candidate a
member voted is an attempt to undermine the
secrecy of the ballot, and the secrecy of the ballot
is a very large brick in the foundations of poli
tical liberty.
A lady writes from Maoriland to The
Bulletin :
If the M.L. birth-rate is sizes smaller than Scripture
and national interests recommend lack of domestic help
might fairly he put forward as an excuse. The marriage
hymn, speeding blushing brides to a fertile haven of con-
jugal bliss, should meet current requirements with a
proviso—“ Mary Jane willing.” Wife postpones being a
fruitful vine upon the walls of her husband’s house till
she can get somebody to clean same house. If the
juvenile twigs are in process of being accomplished, sofi
advts. and fancy wages cry in vain. Dailies howl at
intervals over the desperate lot of couples, boycotted by
Bridget, who break up the happy home for the grea-v-
-chop-and-elderly-egg existence of paying guests. Un-
trammelled mortals, whom no kitchen lady can be in-
duced to bully, swallow public sympathy and a cheap
dinner at handy pie-shops. Children and dining-out are
luxuries that do not agree. The press drops a veil of
awful silence upon the spectacle of the happy man whose
quiver is full of them, wrestling with that quiver in
detail, while his wife fries up Sunday’s mutton. They
dare not feed in public, for Tommy mostly spills his
soup, the baby slobbers, and Johnny plasters dinner on
his nose and the tablecloth in preference to his little
tummy. To these unfortunates the servant problem is a
riddle, swamping Jingoism, the plague, and all latter-dav
evils, rolled up arid multiplied. It’s a worry timed to
demolish a man’s virtues faster than any simultaneous-
missioner’s guile can resurrect them. The “Road to
Ruin ” set of pictures that adorned our childhood’s walls
omitted a significant detail. It should have led off with
an appropriate litho of the family Jane, in ringlets and a
crinoline, “ giving notice.” Before this calamity moral
responsibility becomes a dead letter. Heard t’other dav
of an S.M. whose wife discovered evidence of dishonesty
in their latest “general.” “Lock up your rubbish and
let her alone ! ” testily snapped the rep. of Law—“ She
can cook. We’ve a show of getting a decent meal at last •
let her take what she d d well likes ! ”

Electricity in mining is being more extensively
adopted every day. The Austral Otis Engineering Com-
pany, of South Melbourne, the Australian representatives
of Ganz and Co., have just installed at the Great.
Southern Consols mine, Rutherglen, a complete plant for
the underground haulage, doing away with the old costly
system of trucking; The work is now done by electric
locomotives at a much reduced cost ; the whole of the
drives arid surface works are also lighted from the same
installation. This company has also supplied electric-
pumping plants to the Sons of Gwalia mine, and probably
the largest electric pumps in the world for the Charlotte
Plains and New Havilah mines at Maldon. Having
secured the services of a well-known European expert,
they are now prepared to advise, and contract for any
electrical service such as lighting, pumping, haulage,
traction, rock drilling, or the generation and transmission
of power by the latest and most approved methods, and

The latest attempt to discredit the Federal
Government is a frantic charge—which is voiced very
loudly in the columns of Brisbane Courier —of defrauding
the States out of their surplus. It is alleged that the
Braddon clause gives the Federal Government power to
retain for its own use not more than one-fourth
of each State’s customs and excise to cover
defence expenditure, postal deficits, and other
charges, returning the other three-fourths, to the
State. The Constitution, of course, does nothing of the
kind. It allows the Commonwealth to retain not more
than one-fourth of the whole customs and excise, return-
ing each State its share of the remainder — i.e. , the
amount it contributed, less its fair proportion of the ex-
penses". Supposing the Commonwealth exercised its full
powers, things might pan out roughly thus
Popula- Tariff Revenue Total Tariff
tion. per head. Revenue.
N.S.W. .. 1,360,000 45/- £3,060,000
Victoria .. 1,200,000 40/- 2,400,000
Queensland.. 600,000 30/- 750,000
S.A 360,000 25/- 460,000
Westralia .. 200,000 80/- 800,000
Tasmania .. 175,000 15/- 131,250
3,795,000 40/- £7,691,250
The exact average is £2 and about one-twelfth of a penny
per inhabitant. If the Commonwealth took out of that
the <omplete one-fourth which it is allowed to retain
under the Constitution, that would be 10s. per head.
The result would be that N.S.W. would get back seven-
ninths of its contribution (355. per head); Victoria three-
fourths (305.); Queensland two-thirds (205.) ; South
Australia three-fifths (155.) ; Westralia seven-eights (705.);
and Tasmania only one-third (55.). That is the strict
letter of the Constitution, and no departure from it is
legally possible. Therefore the State that feels itself
slipping had better start a big State lottery at once to
raise the wind, instead of wasting its time in useless
objurgation.

The State Bank of South Australia, which bor-

The year has been the best in the institution’s record,
and the reserve fund is beginning to assume respectable
proportions, but in some other respects the business has
not expanded very rapidly. The principal features of the
State Bank’s progress have been as under :

„ 1901.. 507,408 3773 14 10 „
„ 1902.. 536,906 3985 14 10 ~
These calculations are based on the amount of mortgages
outstanding at the close of the year ; if calculated on the
average amount held during the year the expense rate
would be about Is. higher. In any case, however, it is a
remarkable instance of economical management. The
S.A. State Bank has a margin of £1 per cent, to cover
working expenses and all losses, and now that its bonds
have ceased to sell at a premium, it has to rely on any
savings it can effect out of this for its reserve fund.
There is one point in the system which appears
to call for alteration. The State Bank sells bonds to
provide itself with money to lend out to borrowers. But
as the repayments come in it isn’t allowed to lend them
out again. ' They must be devoted to the repurchase of
bonds, and then new bonds are sold to provide funds for
new loans. This is a clumsy and laborious device which
should be suppressed. It affords no extra security to
anybody, and it makes extra labor, extra expense, and
extra disturbance of the money market. This is the
curious way the tiling works out :
Increase of

It looks as if, in these poor, dry times, it were difficult
to find good agricultural securities to lend on, and
it might be well if the S.A. State Bank went in for making
advances on town and city properties—on any kind of
prop rty, in fact, where the security is good enough.
Meanwhile, it seems to be doing a safe and steady busi-
ness, though one that grows but slowly. Only £7ll of
interest is in arrear, and that amount is only six months
in arrear.

Importer M‘Millan, during the Loan Bill
debate, thus defended the loan boom policy :
“ Because a large amount of loan money had been used
by the different States for developing their resources, it
did not follow that they were in bad circumstances. The
prosperity of Australia'at the present time gave the lie to
those pessimistic views held by many people. In 1900, of
the total debt of the States of 180 millions, 130 millions
were absolutely reproductive, put into such works as
railways, water and sewerage works, and other services,
leavin»' about 40 millions to be accounted for. . . . People
who talked-about the great debt per head of population
forgot that the trade of Australia was something pheno-
menal in the history of the world. That trade amounted
to 161 millions, of which the external trade was 80 million
pounds for less than 4,000,000 people. These figures put
Australia quite outside comparison with ordinary coun-
tries . • He did not believe in ear-marking certain
taxation for public works. It would not be fair to burden
the current revenue with expenditure on practically per-
manent works, and certainly not for works that would
last for the 30 years’ currency of the loan.”
So this is M'Millan’s case boiled down: .
(1) Because Australia, being now on top of the biggest
loan-drunk in its history, and having borrowed last
▼ear enough money to support one-tenth of its popula-
tion, isn’t quite so bad as it might be, therefore that fact
gives the lie to the people who say that it will be worse
when the drunk comes to a compulsory end, and instead
of all this money coming in there will be a bigger mass
of interest going out.
(2) The fact that, after using up our land revenue
and having got rid of the best portion of the public estate
and eaten up the proceeds, all our railways, water and
sewerage works, telegraphs, telephones, and other re-
productive undertakings are mortgaged for every penny
of their value, and the country is burdened with over
£50,000,000 (not £40,000,000) of debt in addition—this fact
shows clearly that we haven’t been borrowing too much.
(3) The fact that we export a great deal of raw material
because we haven’t learned to use it up in our own
factories, and that we import an immense amount of
manufactured goods because we haven’t yet learned to
manufacture for ourselves, and consequently have a large
trade carried in other people’s ships, conclusively proves
that we haven’t borrowed too much.
(4) The fact that our trade, in proportion to population,
is less than that of Belgium, Denmark, Holland or Swit-
zerland proves that it is “phenomenal.”
(5) It isn’t fair to “burden current revenue” vnth
expenditure for “practically permanent works.” But it is
quite fair to sell permanent assets (i.e., land) wholesale and
use the proceeds as revenue. We must be so darned care-
ful not to pay for any public works of which posterity
may possibly get the benefit that the best thing to do is
not to pay for anything. But there is no obligation
whatever to conserve the great land assets that belong as
much to posterity as they do to us. We use up the assets
and leave posterity the debt —and what on earth has
posterity to grumble at ?

The profits, which are the lowest for any half-year since
May, 1899, represent £4 18s. 9d. per cent, per annum on
the shareholders’ funds, as at the commencement of the
half-year. The reserves consist of reserve fund £22,500,
and £7148 of undivided profits. The National Bank
of Tasmania appears to be very chary of making
additions to its permanent reserve nowadays, and carries
forward this big mass of undivided profit persistently.
The business has grown materially within the last
year, there being a solid increase in deposits, note circu-
lation, bill circulation, and cash reserve. The cash
reserve (£157,037) represents nearly 33 per cent, of all
liabilities to the public, a figure which is above the
average, and probably helps to account for the diminished
profits. If a portion of it were invested in reliable State
securities it would probably help the profit-earning
capacity of the bank to some extent; but the National of
Tasmania seems to have no reserve of State securities
whatever—which is by no means a good feature in the
management.

The Bulletin receives from time to time bitter
complaints about the exorbitant and grasping rate of
interest Which the A.M.P. Society charges to its policy-;
holders when their premiums fall into arrear. Of all the
securities in which the society’s money is invested these
are the safest, and the system of charging the highest
rate upon them seems to be only based on the fact that
the distressed policy-holder is an accessible person, and,
in many cases, an easy victim of extortion. The society’s
security is the surrender value of the policy. It can’t
lose by the transaction, for the instant the arrears of
premium and the exorbitant interest amount to the
surrender value the policy is cancelled. The writer has
before him an account in regard to one of these cancelled
policies, in which the interest charged appears to be at the
magnificent rate of 8 per cent., the interest being added on
quarterly, and immediately commencing to multiply on the
compound principle. And 8 per cent, compound interest,
when debited quarterly, comes to considerably more than
8 per cent, compound interest debited yearly. Consider-
ing that the average rate of interest earned on the total
invested funds is only £4 Us. 9d., this is very precipitous,
and why the society should demand such an enormous
amount more from its own members than from strangers,
it is difficult to say. The man who takes a fixed loan on
his policy comes off better (he is probably a business man
who knows the system), but the unbusiness-like man who
simply lets his premiums fall behind in a period of dis-
tress has a bad time, and his policy is cancelled, in many
cases, long before it would be cancelled if he were only
charged a reasonable rate. Last year, £228,206 of interest
—more than a quarter of the total—was derived from
loans on policies and overdue premiums, and a consider-
able part of the big profits appear to arise through the
squeezing of the distressed members who are included in
this item. For one member to live on another in this
fashion suggests cannibalism.

“ J.M.” : The co. is quite sound at present, so
far as it is possible to find out, but its reserves are not so
large as they should be, and there is a considerable
callable capital. Writer wouldn’t mind holding its shares
to a moderate extent, but he wouldn't put his whole sub-
stance in them—not by a long way.

Curiously enough this highly prosperous company—the
largest dividend-payer among the trustee companies of
Australasia—hasn’t formally established a reserve fund
yet, and the £3425 shown above is merely described as a
balance carried forward.

Victoria lately decided to send out commercial
agents to push the sale of its products in foreign parts.
It sent a desperat ly energetic man to South Africa, and
the other day it was cabled that this desperately ener-
getic man had arranged a contract by which Victoria was
to supply a South African co. with twenty million pounds
of pork per annum. Unless there is some mistake that i 3
pushing the sale of Victorian products with a vengeance,
especially as there are only 340,000 pigs in all Victoria,
and the whole Commonwealth doesn’t grow enough pig
for its own consumption—at least in 1899 (the last year
covered by Coghlan’s figures) Queensland and Victoria,
the great pig States, weren’t able to supply the Westralian
demand, and the nett imports of the Commonwealth cost
£26,000. This habit of sending out agents to sell things
without first making sure that we have the things to sell,
means trouble. Still, if the contract is a fact, the best
thing Victoria can do is to grow six million hogs at once—
even if it has to render hog-keeping imperative by passing
a Compulsory Hog Act, and make Bent and Peacock and
Matthew Davies rear the unclean animal on their lawns.

The Argus Permanent Building and Investment
Society (Melbourne) resumes payment of dividends this
year, though only in a small way. From this it may be
reasonably inferred that the management reckons the
worst of the institution’s troubles are over. The recent
record has been as follows:
Profits. Dividends. W ”j£ en Reserves.
April, 1895.. * £1728
„ 1896..£175 ITU £169 1734
„ 1897.. 204 „ 291 1647
„ 1898.. 223 „ 181 1689

„ 1901..1275 „ 1762 1093
„ 1902.. 1494 8 per cent. =£sos 1113 969
There is nothing on the face of things to justify the divi-
dend, though presumably the management has inward
reason for believing that it has nearly finished writing
off losses and depreciation. The profits are certainly in-
creasing handsomely, but last year the amount written
off for depreciation more than swallowed up the increased
profit, and this year dividend and depreciation again
more than swallow them up, so the decrease in the re-
serves still continues. The most objectionable feature of
the business is that comparatively little progress is being
made at shifting the bank overdraft and the mortgage on
the society’s assets. These two items have stood as
follows:
April, 1896 .. £4690 April, 1900 .. £7245
„ 1897 .. 7658 „ 1901 .. 4544
„ 1898 .. 8429 „ 1902 .. 6539
„ 1899 .. 7323
The increased business which is being done appears to be
very profitable, but a co. which has lent out all its
capital, reserve fund, and deposits, and has also mort-
gaged its property and incurred an overdraft and lent
out the proceeds of both operations, leaves itself very
short of liquid assets in case of a run on it. Probably, as
the concern seems perfectly sound, there will be no run,
but the policy isn’t a wise one all the same.

“Miner” from Cobar: I have grafted in some
of the principal mines here, and the first thing that
struck me was the careless and reckless manner in which
they were worked in regard to human life. Men’s lives
have been wantonly sacrificed here to the avarice of the
capitalist, and that through the neglect of some of our
inspectors of mines. The present inspector, however,
does his duty.
* * * •
“S.H.P.”: Last year alone the Broken Hill
mines tipped 75,000 tons of zinc into their waste-dumps.
The average price of the metal during the year was about
£l9—a trifle of £1,425,000 for the lot. Into the same
dumps were turned about £200,000 of silver and £400,000
worth of lead, mainly because it could not be got away
from the zinc. This waste has been going on for years.
Of every £3 taken out of the mines, nearly £2, and in
some cases more than that, has been thrown aside.
Metallurgists have all along known how to treat these
ores, how to turn this two millions a year into money,
but it would have cost over two millions to do it. The
companies are not willing to carry on the business at a loss,
but they are willing to put these millions into circulation
when they can see even a fair chance of coming out level.
At present they do see, or at least one of them thinks it
sees, such a chance, and it is experimenting. It knows,
however, that it cannot possibly make a big profit, may
quite possibly make a big loss (the same co. dropped
nearly £lOO,OOO over a process once before), and certainly
will have to spend a lot on plant. On the other hand, if
it succeeds, even though it makes but little itself, it will
add millions to the realised wealth of the country, give
employment to a large number who badly want it, and
most likely prepare the way for a number of secondary
industries. Is the country going to help ? Is it going
to give the necessary fillip ? It badly wants those
millions which have been lying useless on the mines for
years—is it going to bid a few thousands to get them ? Is
it going to offer a sprat for a mackerel ? It needn’t even
risk its sprat; if it doesn’t land the mackerel it keeps its
sprat. Possibly it will be advised that the mackerel will
come, anyhow. Well, it has not come after many years
of waiting, and there was far more inducement for it to
land on its own hitherto than there is now. Australia
may get its mackerel by simply waiting on the bank ; but
if it uses a hook and line it will be a good deal less likely
to go hungry to bed.

High tin-value has led to the owner of Poola-
macca station putting up a dressing plant on the old
Euriowie field, which forms part of his.jrun. It was
Brodribb, a previous owner of the same place, and his
wife who blew-in the first Broken Hill silver-smelter.

Hillgrove Proprietary shares declined from 6s.
to 4s. last week. The reason is that it has been a perfect
godsend to a lot of local holders to be able to realise on
the stock. Shares not going to England, as is commonly
supposed, but being gathered in wholesale by Sydney and
Adelaide. - Rumors about difficulties in financing the
show so much moonshine. It is too absurd to suggest
that English holders, after spending so much money, will
allow the mine to languish for funds in view of the re-
ported excellent prospects. If they really have any
inclination that way the only conclusion that can be
arrived at is that the reports as to developments have
been grossly exaggerated.
* * * *
For over two years there has been much talk
about a deep-level scheme at Wyalong(N.S.W.). Several
leases have been pegged out on the side-on blocks toNeeld’s
and other mines, and the lessees have been kept busy
getting suspensions. So far, they have been lucky
enough, or clever enough, to get cables at the crucial
time. The warden has intimated that he has lost faith in
promises by cable, and in granting two months’
suspension t’other day said that any further application
would have to be supported by something more substan-
tial. At first it was represented that Charters Towers
men were prepared to test the deep ground, but now the
shekels—it will take many bushels of them—are being
sought in London. Writer does not think it altogether a
wild-cat scheme, but it is purely a conjectural one ; it is
assumed that the lode-formation will maintain a given
angle and that outside the original leases it may be
found—well, anywhere between 2500 ft. and Sheol. That,
however, is not the question which troubles London just
now. London has frequently intimated that it will have
nothing to do with mining schemes in municipalised
areas in N.S.W. until the rating powers of councils are
clearly defined. Original owners of Cobar were wise in their
generation. They took care that their 1000-acre freehold
was excluded from the municipal area. The municipal
boundaries surround the mine—which is in the heart of
the town— so that the property is in the paradoxical
position of being within and without the municipality.
• * * * r
Great Cobar shareholders unanimous, in adopt-
ing the agreements for the settlement of the law-suit,
and placing the property under offer to an English syn-
dicate, through Mr. A. S. Joseph. The syndicate
evidently means business, as two reliable copper-mining
men and a chartered accountant are being sent to make
the necessary investigations. The combined fees of thCse
experts will not amount to less than £lO,OOO. While the
Cobar shareholders silently acquiesced in the agreements
there are many of them who privately express the
opinion that the project is mere bluff on the part of the
tribute syndicate, which will certainly be at no disadvan-
tage should the option not be exercised. It is contended
that while the experts may pass the Cobar mine at
£560,000, they are not likely to approve of the purchase
of the Lithgow works and other small properties at
£600,000. According to the agreement the mine and the
refining works are inseparable. This is unquestionably
the weak spot in the project.
Paringa Consols (W. A.) decided to deepen south
shaft to 1200 ft., evidently concluding that the lode at the
800 ft. level has no possibilities. It seems hard lines that
co. should be so near and yet so far from results, border-
ing, as its property does, on the Brown Hill and Associated
Northern.
* • . *•
Kalgurli (W.A.) returns for May are announced
as 29600 z. from 2830 tons. This shows a setback of 3500 z.
as compared with April. Treatment cost is given as 225.
9d. per ton, but this is an arbitrary statement. Even if
correct, the plant is so new that cost of repairs must be
very slight, as yet. Ore for the mill comes from the 640,
700 and 900 ft. levels.
* • * •
M. Weil, the French expert sent out by Lord
Rothschild to inspect Merton’s Reward (W.A.), has com-
pleted that job. He is now in Kalgoorlie, and it is said
will inspect several of the big mines. The usual crop of
rumors of wholesale amalgamations are, as a consequence,
being bandied about, but nothing really authentic is
known.
* * * •
Golden Horseshoe (W.A.) turned out 15,6990 z.
from 7880 tons during May, which is a record for the
mine. For a period of two years the mine’s returns have
topped 15,0000 z. monthly—a really marvellous perform-
ance. The new 50-head mill has been running for some
time, and will be cleaned up at the end of the month.
The yield should be a bumper, and will again lift the
Horseshoe to the head of the list. No one on thp spot
seems to doubt mine’s ability to supply the mill.
* » * *
Associated Northern (W.A.) continues to open
up the rich chute along the Oroya’s boundary. The lode
at this point is about 100 ft. wide, but, of course, the very
rich portion is a mere fraction of this. Exploring by
diamond drill is still being pushed ahead, and, if the lode
is found to go down, a large new main shaft will probably
be started. The shaft has been at a .standstill for a long
time, as Capt. W. H. Rhodda, who came from the Lan-
caster West mine on the Rand, considers it far too small
for economical working. In his last annual report Capt.
Rodda stated that the mine had bottomed, but that
there was enough gold in sight to pay 40s. per share in
div§. Diamond drilling may make him modify that
opinion.
* * * *
Boulder Main Reef (W.A.) still manages to
continue its monthly crushings, the last being 1836 tons
for 18560 z. A lot of exploration has been done in the
lower levels without much result, but the management
does not yet despair. On several occasions lately rumors
of a find have’been circulated in the share market, but
the scrip has always sagged away again. The manage-
ment foolishly believes in secrecy, and visitors are
unwelcome.

G. Republican Dibbs to some returned
cohentingenters at Sydney:
Never had they shown the white feather, but had
fought i n every occasion as near to the principles of
Christianity as they could.
Which recalls the Vic. A.N.A. magnate’s histori-
cal boast that the members of that association
prided themselves on being “moderately moral.”
.Nothing has happened this century, in a
time prolific of literary swill, to equal in awful-
ness the “Coronation Hymn,” the text of which
has been sent to acting-Premier Deakin, and pub-
lished in the Melbourne dailies. One verse :
May his Queen Consort, ever near,
His stay be, mid earth’s glory.
A heart to greet, a mind to cheer,
A true life’s gift most lowly.
And may their reign by’ Thee be blessed
With Christ’s own peace attending
To give this nation, each their best,
A holy gift ascending.
As a Coronation riddle for the use of schools and
asylums particularly asylums—that verse might
have a future before it, provided there is a solu-
tion, but, as a literary effort, it would cast a black
pall of discredit on John Cash Neild, or the poet
Purtell, and bring Bard of Works Fitzgibbon into
contempt. The Bulletin has had as large and
varied an experience of bad poets as here and
there one, but it joyfully awards its tripe cham-
pionship to Rev. A. Roth well Gregory, of Ulgham
Vicarage, Morpeth, Northumberland, who “did”
the Coronation Hymn, and publishes his crime.
In another sp.,t he says :
A nation’s prayers to thee we bring,
And tears for Afric’s sadness.
And then continues in the same strain of brutal
bathos:
To our ‘ ‘ good Albert,” with the just,
Bring all through love abounding.
And this is the poetic bilge-water which “has
received the approval of the King, the Secretary
for the Colonies, and other leading men in Great
Britain”! And yet is said to be “suitable to
the occasion.”

An English historian on the crowning of
King Edward’s mother in 1838: “At home, the
Queen’s Coronation was the great event of the
year, and took place on the 28th June. Its
anticipation created such enthusiasm that some of
the journals pronounced the people to be ‘ Corona-
tion mad.’ There were those, however, who
looked upon it with a cold and unfriendly eye.
Earl Fitzwilliam ridiculed such ceremonials as
being little better than idle pageants suited only
for barbarian ages, and doubted ‘whether the ex-
hibition of a youthful princess to a staring
populace was consistent with feminine delicacy.’
The Marquis of Londonderry asked him if he really
meant that there should be no Coronation, and
upon his answering ‘yes,’ asked him if he was
prepared for the sequel viz., that there
should be no earl Fitzwilliam.” The spectacle of
an English peer (the Fitzwilliams are Anglicised-
Irish) objecting to a coronation circus-show has
lost none of its humor in the 64 years that have
elapsed between the barbarous pageantry of Queen
Victoria and her eldest son. Why, the Crown in
itself is a democratic institution as compared with
the coronet. A birthright legislator who mocks
at royal mummery ought to be hanged for illogical
disloyalism, and drawn and quartered for flat
blasphemy.

New Pyrmont (Sydney) Bridge, which has

G. Republican Dibbs is turning a cup out of one
of the piles of the old bridge for presentation to
Works Minister O’Sullivan.
A rumor is going round that reform is
contemplated in connection with various recently
created N.S.W. Govt, departments. Sydney
Harbor Trust is one huge spending concern which
is outside the Public Service Board’s jurisdiction.
Others are the Wharves Resumption Board, the
Rocks’ Resumption Board, the Miners’ Accident
Relief Board, the Unemployed Board, the Labor
Commissioners, &c. Ex-politicians are, as a rule,
in charge of these sub-departments. It is under-
stood that the P.S. Board is demanding that some
amalgamation be effected among the different
staffs, and that the P.S. Act should apply to
appointments in these sub-departments.
Seriousness of the situation in regard to
Sydney water-supply is shown by the fact that
there is already public discussion of the possi-
bility of having to pump water from the Nepean
River at Penrith, and carry it by train to Pros-
pect reservoir. There is a huge pool in the Nepean
near Penrith, but it receives the drainage of a big
population, and when that sort of water comes to
Sydney it will be a fine time for the microbes.

Evangelist Torrey recently informed the
people of Maryborough (Vic.) that “the testi-
mony of the Chief of Police at New York was
that six-sevenths of the fallen women there owed
their fall to suggestions made in the round dance.”
Seeing that New York is a long way off, and the
name of the Chief wasn’t given, it is a pity that
Torrey didn’t bring along an affidavit. The want
of an affidavit is much felt in such cases. It was
the absence of that document which undermined
Max Hirsch, the German-Australian Freetrade
apostle, who used to publish statements in the
Beacon to the effect that a well-known hat-
grower in Melbourne, or a liog-manufacturer in
Gippsland, had said that if Victoria had Free-
trade he would be able to export ten million hats
annually to Greenland, whereas he now only sent
one hog to Westralia every two centuries, or some-
thing like that, which conclusively proved, &c.,
<fcc. The bold statement that someone a long way
off said something is the easiest argument going.
You could even demolish Bill Lyne in one act by

The announcement that Gov. Rawson and
family favor homoeopathy should give the cult a
much-needed lift in Sydney. Some 20 years ago,
in the days of Drs. Fischer, Atherton, Brereton,
and Kyngdon, homoeopathy flourished and fine
incomes were made by its practitioners. To-day
it is out of fashion, and there are few legally-
qualified men in practice. Judge Windeyer was
moving for a homoeopathic hospital in Sydney
when the Dean case intervened, and since then
the project has languished.

The alleged Greek-Argentine gypsies, or
ancient Hebrew Bohemians from Italy, who have
long made the sands of Bondi (N.S.W.) hideous
and loathsome, packed up their blankets and
about 2ewt. of fleas, the other day, and left. They
took the Westward road, and everything else that
wasn’t nailed down. At Auburn, about 10 miles
from Sydney, they met another band of cadging
rovers who smelt similarly, and each band was so
glad to see the other that they adjourned to (he
nearest pub., and were soon drunk and fighting in
six languages. The police waded in and restored
peace, and the hotel was then washed. These
strange yellow howlers do pretty much as they
please, and indulge in acts which would lead to
six months’ gaol if a clean white citizen did them.
A tale of the Sydney express. There was on
board, amongst others, an Ameri-
can “drummer,” who, having
unavailingly spent much time
and persuasion on Syd-
ney traders, felt “vurry
tired.” His fellow
travellers, mostly Syd-
neyites, were discuss-
ing the lately-origina-
ted “ South Africa
Day,” and one of them,
turning to the man of
commerce, remarked,
“ Say, old man, you’re
pretty strong on * days ’ in the
States, aren’t you?” “Yes, that’s
so. Guess we’ve got Independence
Day, and Thanksgiving Day, and
there are others. But you folks out
here have ‘ fixed ’ on one day that
whips me. Yes, sir, and that day
Sydney has made all her own, you
bet.” “ The deuce she has. What's
its name ? ” Then America beamed:
“Well, boys, it’s just this—‘To-morrer.’”

Two persons, names and sex not men-
tioned, were recently, in Sydney, fined £1 and
costs, or 14 days, for keeping their lolly-shops open
on Sunday. That was more than the whole stock-in-
trade would sell for, and they are now occupying
cells in Darlinghurst gaol. To keep them there
will cost the State a trifle over £4, besides the
prosecution expenses. And what for ? There are
500 people selling lollies just as freely as the
Government sells tram-rides, and the parsons sell
sermons, music, and opportunities of dress dis-
play every Sunday in Sydney. How came it that
the tower of Siloam, as represented by the Law,
fell on this particular party of unfortunates and
ground them to powder ? On the face of things,
it appeals (hat what the Law says does not matter
- s - the officers of the Law think.
And the citizen desiring to do a bit on the cross,
whether m lollies or the odds, mustn’t begrudge
the on requisite to keep the police from getting
rusty.
TO-DAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
So beautiful! Ah yes—
(Men love me, so they say,
And I would fain confess
I love their love), to-day.
But the morrow, and anon ?
Will Love’s impassioned lay
Be tuned, the lute upon,
So sweetly as to-day ?
Will yon mirror, then as now
Show Beauty’s eyes aflame ?
And face (that wooers vow
Always to love) —the same ?
Is’t true love never dies,
Though future brings decay ?
I doubt. So ’twill be wise
To live, beloved to-day 1

And wrinkles mock the merry smiles, as round bright

Tis creeping on 1 ’Tis creeping on I with halting step and
slow,
And pallid shadows wan the cheek where roses used to

And forms erect, in years agone, bend as trees ’neath the

’Tis creeping on 1 TSs creeping on I—with sorrow in its

The laggard will, the palsied hand, the ever-fagging

And shadows dim the earthly path, to never lift again.

One of those economic.-!
chorus-girls, who occupy suites of
rooms at the leading hotels on £2
ss. a week, concluded her day
out at a Melb. shop by beckoning
to her “boy” who stood sheep-
ishly in the doorway. “Wliatis
it, my dear V ” he asked respect-
fully. “I want you to pay for
these,” ordered the Queen with
a sweep of her hand. “How
much ? ” asked the docile male
person. Her Majesty flared like
a Roman candle. “ How much?”
she echoed scornfully. “ How do
I know ? ” and swaggered out to
her brougham, leaving the un-
fortunate capitalist the centre of
the grins of customers and shop
girls, as he drew his cheque-book
from his pocket.

Not generally known that
some 40 years ago Brisbane levied
a kind of octroi. The market
dues were farmed out at so much
per annum, and the lessee had
the privilege of levying on all
fruit and vegetables brought into
the city. There were three prin-
cipal roads leading into the town,
and the chief occupation of the
market lessee consisted in watch-
ing these roads and capturing any
vegetable John who might at-
tempt to smuggle in cabbagee
without paying the regular dues.
Nowadays the tram system is
practically Brisbane’s octroi —
with the octroi tariff exported for
foreign dividends.

It is suggested, as the
BritLh Government is very
anxious to build up a “loyal’
population in S’Africa, that the
Commonwealth should enrol a
contingent of young marriage-
able women and send their,
across to join the troopers now
in the co.iquered territories.
London Daily Express solemnly
advises that 100,000 women
■should be carried. thither from
England, as it is noted that
Britishers wedding Afrikander
wives have less influence with their children than
their Dutch relatives. And it frequently happens
that Britishers marrying Boer wives themselves
turn to the Afrikander side.

A Bulletin correspondent :
The practice of N.S.W. Govt, charity-inspectors of call-
ing at the various schools to examine the boarded-out
State children is one of the meanest incidents of a mean
system. When school is in, the inspector knocks at the
door and asks for Johnny So-and-so whereupon Johnny
colors like a boiled lobster, and crawls out under the eye
of the class. When he returns, after a space, he is bom-
barded with questions by the other children as to the
man who calls so regularly to see him, and, unless he is a
finished liar, he lets out the secret. In the case of State
orphans, the thing is not so bad, for the kid ®n inform
questioners that the people are paid to keep him, and
that the man conies to see that he is properly treated.
But the poor youngsters who are boarcled-out to t e r
own mothers cannot explain that they are State children,
and that the man comes to see if their mother keeps them
properly. In most cases, the school-teachers do their
best to prevent the secret fr'on leaking out to the classes,
but the regular inspector soon excites curiosity, then
suspicion, and when that, at last, becomes certainty, the
poor kid is exposed to the verbal barbarities of his un-
thinking school-fellows. The State purpose could surely
be as well served by the inspectors making unexpected
raids on the homes at intervals ; the present plan is just
need esso uelty.

Maoriland papers print as a huge joke
an account of a breach-of-promise case, m winch
the man broke off the contract after keeping the
girl on a string for 10 years. A joke !—it, was a
bigger tragedy than the Butler murders 1 hey
were a pair of diverse tastes. He was fond of
attending races to “put on his little bit, while
she preferred to go to temperance and mission
meetings, and when they met these divergent
tastes clashed. He used to call round in the
evenings to see her, and then produce a paper or
borrow a book from the family book-case, and read
all the evening. He was fond of reading, and
hardly spoke to her. And she stood it for 10 long
years'; Fox’s “ Book of Martyrs records nothing
like it. At last the pot boiled over, bhe was
tired of watching him read, and she asked him,
one Sunday night, to come out on the balcony
{people hug and spoon on the balconies in Wel-
lington—there’s nowhere else to do it), but the
soulless one went on reading a paper and merely
grunted. She asked him again, and he said All
right' ” —but never shifted. Then something
snapped-and she slapped his face. He made a
dive for the door, but she followed him, and, after
sprinting 100yds. down the street, caught him
and induced him to come back When she got
him inside he alleged that she dealt it out to
him, and he was afraid to marry her. The lady
got £lOO damages.
NSW Arbitration Court is already
glutted’ with work! The President told the
tailoresses and the undertakers employees that
their claims could not be heard till next year
The last-named have among their claims one that
there should be no funerals on Christmas Day, and
pleaded that the case might he heard before the
coming Xmas. The Judge could not promise.
Trades-unions might take to heart the Judges
advice, to exhaust all other means of settlement
before appealing to the court.
THE REASON WHY.
SHE: “I wondered why the good die young!"
HE: “ Nature's compensation , my dear. Just think what a
happy release it must be!”
The lift danger has been recalled t<
Sydney’s tnind by a fatal accident at Farmer
drapery store. At the inquest the coroner reso
lutely prevented any real inquiry as to the cause
of the tragedy, by discounting the evidence of
fellow-passengers of the deceased (alleging that
the driver had lost control of the lift, and that it
was going at a very quick rate), on the ground
that they were “not experts.” It is well for
citizens to know that only “ an expert ” can give
evidence of value in regard to a lift’s speed. And
what makes a man a lift-expert, anyway ?

An inquiry has been promised by N.S.W.

The haughty dames of Melb. Women’s
Hospital Catmittee are just commencing to realise
where their policy of interfering with things they
don’t understand has landed them. Their financial
sub-committee reported lately that the main!en-
ance account credit balance was down to £2OO,
that next month they probably wouldn’t have a
penny, and that, while last month their expendi-
ture reached £791, the receipts totalled only £226.
The Gov. subsidy, which arrives next month, is
already mortgaged; so, apparently, another public
appeal for money to buy tickets to put over the
bed of the unmarried mother must be engineered.

Down at Bendigo, where a citizen got his
nose badly bitten on peace-celebration night,
one of the papers described the last great drunk of
the war with interesting frankness. After relating,
in a friendly sort of way, how the mob of Jingo
ruffians nearly murdered a man who called out
“ Boo,” it related this :
Two middle-aged men stood discussing the situation
under the verandah, both apparently having pro-Boer
tendencies. “ Well, there’s a lot to make a fuss about,
isn’t there ? ” remarked one. “ The foremost nation of the
world going mad because it has conquered a handful of
Boer farmers. It’s absurd! ” At that psychological
moment two short-coated, high-heeled, big-hatted young
fellows came up and overheard the last remark. The
Australian larrikin may be a loafer, a drinker, and an
assaulter of women, but he is withal a patriot.
Thev both stopped short. “’Ere, wot’s that?”
demanded the bigger one, with a glare that
unmistakably foretold “ stoush.” ‘Wots absurd!
—and ’oo’s absurd ; and wot the —— >
d’yer mean. Put yer ’ands up, yer Bore ! Ain’t yer got
no common ? ’S’truth ! fer two pins I’d deal yer one
on the boko 1” He was about to carry-out the threat
when the form of a policeman loomed up in the distance,
and the wrathful loyalists made off, leaving a streak cf
blue haze behind them.
The Jingo described by his own admiring paper—
a loafer, a thief, a drinker, and an assaulter of
women ! What a character to get from a friend !
* * * *
The reported dismay of the President of
N.S.W. Arbitration Court at the number of cases
set down for hearing is hardly intelligible. His
Honor must recognise that practically the whole
industrial world of the State comes before him for
a fresh start. When, however, the start is
actually begun under the new conditions there is
every probability that the Court will have an easy
time.
Gov.-Gen. Hopetoun will leave behind
him a band of staunch friends and admirers in the
Melbourne unemployed. It is not merely because
he has often “stood Sam,” and always shown
himself sympathetic, but he has done the right
thing so tactfully, and with so evident a contempt
for the cherished opinions of Fat in connection
with the unemployed lower orders, that the
workers are now swearing by his Ex. The other
day he handed Fleming a cheque for £lOO
for distribution amongst the unemployed. Fleming
is the unemployed leader of whom eminent respec-
tability has only one opinion, and that is thafehe
ought to be hanged out of hand. The Yarra-
bank orator requested the Gov.-Gen. to ask others
to take a hand in distributing the money, but the
Hopetoun said No. He had, he said, the com-
plete confidence in Mr. Fleming that was dis-
played by the men whom he led, and he was
greatly obliged to him for the trouble he had
taken, and the good judgment he had shown in
distributing former gifts. This particularly
delighted the unemployed, as it was thought to
be in some measure “one in the eye” for the
police boss who had ordered the mounted con-
stables to ride over Fleming at the opening of the
State Parliament, and another “on the point”
for portly Influentials who applauded the act of
the exalted bobby. ,

Concerning a naval relic :
The gunpowder hulk La Mutine, alias Aladdin, was
auctioned, t’other day, by Tas. Government, and fetched
£49. For over 40 years the old hrig has been enveloped
in a romantic fog of more or less unreliable tradition,
every other oldest inhabitant of Hobart swearing that
she was the identical hooker that carried Nelson’s Nile-
v ctorv dispatch to England, 113 years ago. As the hulk
is still seaworthy, not a few speculators have at various
times taken the trouble to look up her pedigree, with a
view to an English show season. At the auction, the
salesman was asked whether he wou'd guarantee the
identity of the vessel, but no guarantee was forthcoming.
It appears there is a hiatus in her history somewhere, and
closest search of the Admiralty records fails to fill it.
There is no entry of the sale of the original La Mutine in
the books of the Navy, and absolutely nothing to show
what became of her. Years ago, soothe story goes,
when the Tasmanian craft was being altered for
whaling purposes, in the Derwent, a round shot
was found somewhere in her innards. Said shot had
kept itself highly polished by rolling back and forth
between the timbers, and bore certain marks that
proved it to have been French, and a most reliable witness
as to the vessel’s identity as La Mutine. But the ship-
wright who is alleged to have discovered the cannon-ball
no longer lives, and he left nothing behind him to indi-
cate where the missile might be found, and no plan of its
particular strawberry-mark, in case it was accidentally
dredged up from the foreshore. And so the gap in the
history of a fine old barnacled mystery had to be
by the mists of tradition, and the truth appears to have
Irop >ed through into oblivion, and become for ever lost.
If the hulk is really and truly the original La Mutine,
first captured from the French and afterwards used
against France at the Nile, there is a tidy fortune to be
made out of her as an exhibit. But the prosaic person
vho bought her for £49 went solely on the copper value
af her bolts and the worth of her historic planking for
irewood, and hopes to clear a week’s wages on his spec.
The sale of such a hoary tradition for £49 indicates that
Tas. Government is very hard up for money, or is grow-
■ g dangerously indifferent to British legends.
HE MEANT IT.
THE HOSPITAL NURSE: “ Hit by a brick, eh? I
suppose it was an accident?”
HIS MATE: “ No fear, Miss. The bloke meant
it for ’im.”
“ J.L. W.” : Re the administration of
anaesthetics: —
The wonder is that the usual harsh and careless method
does not result in many more deaths. I once, when in
full general health, underwent ether and an operation at
the hands of two prominent medicos in an Australian
capital. Ten words would have explained to me how to
inhale, and would have prepared me for the administra-
tion, hut ins; ead of that, the executioner almost sprang,
upon me without warning, and clapped the muzzle over
my face with some force. It was so like the familiar
melodrama business that now I laugh to remember it
hut- then I gasped at the ferocity of the onslaught. My
heart was gripped and stood still, hut, as it happened,
soon resumed pumping operations, so that there was nfr-
inquest—though a subject with a weaker heart would
have “snuffed out.” The many who /wire done so, I
believe, have been simply slain through this coarsely
stupid practice.

A cyclist was lately brought before Tam-
worth (N.S.W.) court charged with biking with-
out a light. The P.M., on looking up the
regulations, declared that there was „no mention
at all of a “ lighted ” lamp. He said if a cyclist
carried a lamp he was within the letter of the law,
even if it had no wick or oil, and dismissed the
information.

This is a frequent advt. nowadays, and indicates
that the average State pensioner has a rough time.
He was retrenched beyond starvation point by a
soulless Government to help pay tor its S’African
debaucheries, and now he is sweated by the private
employer for the price of enough to keep body and
soul together a little longer. And if the Govern-
ment learns that he is earning an occasional
“ bob ” it will dock his pension to a dead certainty.

Jim had been very useful to old Mac. in
business matters, and was offered a “fiver” in
recognition, which he refused as extravagant
payment for friendly services. He suggested
a pipe as a memento. Intending c’onor,
being non-smoker, objected to the pipe, but
promised his young friend a “really good”
souvenir—which came to hand next day in
the form of a receipted account for twelve
months’ sitting at a well-1 nown church !!
Probably the old man was in a position to
get “ paper” for the parson’s show.
Westralia has put its old Swan-
River day prison regulations in the
fire, and has pasted up a new code
of rules, which are described as
■‘humane and reformative.”
Brutal lagdom, however, still
provides that a sheriff or
sitting justice may, for any
breach of the 284 . rules
and regulations, sentence a
prisoner to dark cell, irons,
and bread-and-water for
three days; or for more
serious offences, or for a
repeated offence, the same
for a month, except that
the bread-and-water diet
must be varied after seve n
days; or if the visiting
justice’s fancy runs that
way (and there are some
wonderful visiting jus-
tices out back), three
dozen lashes by way of
“personal correction.”

In Westralia, which is
still deeply stained with lag-
day traditions, a boy of 5|
years was, the other day,
arrested for larceny. The
mounted policeman nabbed the
desperate criminal at his home, five
miles from town, and made him walk the five
hot, dusty miles to the station, barefooted, by the
side of his horse.

At Inglewood (Vic.), three Chinamen and
two women were charged, on separate counts,
with sly-grog selling. One old woman, holder of
a wine license, went up for a month’s hominy,
after much counter-swearing, in which the oaths
of two Govt. “ trappers ” prevailed, over an
alleged offence said to have been committed two
months previously. According to news report,
one of the informers had a most treacherous
memory:
He would not swear that he did not suggest to her that
she"should keep a little spirits, and did not think he said,
“ Couldn’t you keep a drop of beer on the quiet?” De-
fendant did not say she was not so foolish in her old age
as to do anything to send her to gaol. Witness might
have said, “ Could you not keep a drop on the sly?” He
forgot whether he suggested that or not.
Now here is a question for the Law to think over
very hard : What is the moral value of the oath of
a man who won’t say that he wasn’t debased
enough to lay a trap like this ? And what is the
value of his alleged clear recollection that an
offence was committed, if his memory is so bad
that he can’t recollect whether he incited to the
offence or not ?

You never loved me, never;
Now you are mine to kiss.
Death has given you to me—
Glory to Death for this I
Surely, now, I may kiss you
On eyelids, lips, and brow ;
Fallen asleep in the silence,
No kisses tire you now.
Last time I would have kissed you
You turned away your head ;
You cannot turn from my kisses
Now you are lying dead.
Red lips yet warm and smiling,
Cheeks that are growing cold,
Now I can keep you and kiss you,
Now is my love grown bold.
You turned from me in your gladness—
Turned with impatient brow ;
Now you are prey to my kisses,
They cannot tire you now.

Promoters of the Ball in aid of the North Shore
Hospital (Sydney) expect to clear £5OO. The
suspended below the gallery brought in
£100; the galleries were full of half-crown specta-
tors attracted by the spectacle of the Dancing
Seasons, and there must have been fully 900
persons on the floor. There was a White
Spring and a Green Spring; girls in both
sets were mostly good-looking and Springy
enough in point of age and movement, but
the managers gave their exhibits no special
Australian flavor The White Spring (white
frocks with wreaths of pink roses) was non-
committal and European. The Green Spring
suggested the April of the Mother-in-law country:
the pale green fluttering frocks were good; but
instead of the massed primroses, why not wattle?
A rtiticiai wattJe can be got as easily as those little
cotton primroses. A primrose never was anything
v° !u 6 a y e l . ow primrose—even when it grew
by the Murrumbidgce’s brim, but the wattle has all
that Mendelssohn wrote into his Spring Song.
Possibly the managers are European-born, fn
which case Spring with them is synonymous
Z l t Ap rni. a £ d primroses, not September and
wattle. The Black Winter Set of dancers, robed
in black, with powdered hair, in which nestled
black crows (sparrow size), and carrying staves
crowned with arum lilies and leaves, was a goodly
sight. It stood out from the mass of white (the
ball was monotonously, coldly white—Bo per cent
of the gowns being virginal) as a black shadow on
a white blind. It, of course, suggested the Euro-
pean winter. I suppose no one cared to make a
spectacle of our winter — this winter as it is in the

The White Winter set at the North Shore ball

A particularly pretty and marvellously preserved
matron who is a grandmother, looks in her own
naturally brown hair, and at a fair distance, riot
much more than 35; she looked in her floured
coiffure quite 65. The Beauty of the N.S. line '
had also whitened her glossy black hair, and
patched her Iphigema face with exasperating
results, if she had rosed her cheeks and lips and
Indian-inked her eyes she would have looked
picturesque and fulfilled the demands of the white
hair. I recall a memory of one woman, not at this
ball, whom powdered hair and patches made
almost pretty, and she was niggery of thatch,
swarthy of complexion, with an ironstone expres-
sion and a mouth hard as a quarry. Two fine
flannel-flowers in a pile of dark hair looked well
and someone got a good effect from black poppies
on white satin.
S OV- ’ Lad y> and Miss Rawson, at-
tended by A.D.C.’s and private sec., came early
and did their duty in the opening Lancers, with
partners of other persons’ choosing. Miss Rawson
wore on the corsage of her white gown a pendant
of what looked like garnets and diamonds. It
was very big and old-fashioned, and was probably
an heirloom. Captain Watt, who risked rheu-

deadly sins, did not put cruelty at the

The irony of it. A debutante at a recent public
ball handed up her ball-card at the door, with an
accurate description of her dress and ornaments
written on the back. It was marked for Granny’s

Writes my Brisbane correspondent:—
Sir Edward Stuart-Riehardson took his final
departure from Brisbane last week, leaving many
regretful friends. He belongs to one of the oldest
and poorest baronetcies in Scotland, and his old
home is let to a ‘ sassenacli ’ bishop with plenty
of the needful to keep the beautiful place in
repair. He had hopes of being taken on as an
extra aide when the new Governor arrived, but
that astute person preferred new brooms to old
ones. Brisbane’s only baronet was democratic in
his tastes to a degree.
The Chennsides become more and more popu-
lar with the masses, and Sir Herbert diligently
trots from one little function to another, raising
various shows out of pre-historic obscurity, and
making the public gasp at his sheet of weekly
® n B’ a g'onients published in the dailies. However,
he pleases the semi-tones immensely, and the full
tones come in for many dinner parties with ping-
pong and ‘ bridge ’ afterwards.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent:—
“One of Lady Hopetoun’s very last appear-
ances at a Melbourne society function was marked
by an incident which put a great strain on her
gravity. The Countess on this occasion was so
pleasant and conversational that a shy, nervous
lady plucked up courage to say—‘And you are
really going to leave us ! I can hardly realise it,’
&c., &c. Then, finding herself encouraged to say
something more on the vice-regal departure topic,
, sh y party added, with an appropriate sigh,
rsut there ! I suppose your loss is our gain.’ The
Countess, who saw the absurdity of the mistake
in a twinkling, tried hard to suppress a smile by
biting her lips. Now that she has gone away it
h®S ln s to be said, in excuse for Her Frigidity,
that she suffered from a quick Irish sense of the
ludicrous, and because she was unable to escape
the attentions of toadies she resorted to iciness as
the easiest means of disguising her inclination to
laugh.
“ The red carpet, sign of expected vice-royalty,
was laid on Glen’s music-hall floor on Thursday,
when Mr. C. Nuttall’s picture of the opening of
the Commonwealth Parliament was presented for
its baptism by criticism. But the Gov.-General
came not, having at the eleventh hour cancelled all
® n f? a £ements preparatory to packing his traps for
Sydney. President Baker, of the Senate, took the
place of His Lx., and delivered the curtain-raiser
m the style of a droning preacher. All the
speakers bolted from the very starting-gate round
the political track, and spoke of the blessings of
h ederation, instead of the merits of the artist.
The Crowning festivities in Melbourne are
running more to religious services than anything
else. The Gov.-General is attending morning
worship in two churches (the Scotch and the
Anglican), and evening devotions at the R.C.
Cathedral. The evening party on Thursday night
—a rather srnall-and-early affair—will be the one
gaiety that the departing chief indulges in, and
this among his own household gods. The follow-
ing reception at ‘ Stonington ’ on Thursday is to
be even smaller —an affair simply of officials.
The Melb. Writers’ Club, which was under-
stood to be a purely feminine association, for the
benefit of souls that couldn’t expand in the in-
artistic atmosphere of the local Salon, has already
started appealing to the sympathy and support
of mere Man. This week Donald Macdonald is
to lecture at the Athenaeum Hall on behalf of the
Pen Sisterhood. The subject of Mac’s discourse
sounds suitable enough— 1 Peace and War.’ There
will surely be war in that Writers’ Club ere some-
body—of the male sex—effects a final peaceful
settlement by selling up the furniture.
• “T’other evening, when Female Suffragists met
in the 1 own Hall to rejoice over their recent
admission to the ‘charmed circle of politics,’the
Leg. Council was attacked, and a sympathetic
man yelled in execration of M.’s.L.C., ‘ lot of hold
wyrnmen / ’ And then he wondered, poor, be-
nighted creature, why all the ladies near looked
daggers at him. Two of the speakers wore petti-
coats—stout, shrewd, kindly, old Miss Spence, the

and Mrs. Lowe, a gentle, spectacled dame of 68.
Vida Goldstein, absent on. a mission to ’Murika

peculiarity about that Suffrage carouse was
the number of untidy men scattered through the
audience. T don’t refer to the rough, but whole-
some, collarless labor-man, who always rolls up
when the Leg. Council is likely to be keel-hauled
but the long-haired wearers of the dirtiest collars
you ever saw. One dear old patriarch arrived
sporting the raggedest pants ever seen outside a
stage-bandit’s cave, with a frank gleam of Nature’s
buff showing here and there. It almost looked
as if the opponents of Female Franchise had sent
him and others to typify the neglected husbands
ot Lmaneipated Women.
“A curious female sat in the gallery of the
House of Reps, with an opera-glass levelled on the
members. This had been endured on other occa-
sions in silence, but this time somebody’s blood
got up and through a messenger the glasses were
ordered to be removed. The fervent disciples of
Demosthenes don’t mind the levelling of a
woman’s eye on their noble brows, but draw the
line at the lorgnette, possibly anxious to get the
benefit of the distance for their homely features.
“A sharp Federal officer, brought much into
touch with Acting-Premier Deakin, describes him
as haying, among many good qualities, colossal
conceit and self-assurance. In the House he wears
u ‘ g i lt ! J S , pnghtly ’ a^rnost evening-party air, with
hands idle, and apleasantand inviting expression of
expectancy. Members and Ministers areconstantly
turning tc Deakin, plying him with questions,
finding relief in his jaunty air.
V Mrs. Hume Cook got over the difficulty of
writing notes to several hundreds of friends
mostly her husband’s political brethren and pals—
by sending gold-lettered cards acknowledging
the receipt of the kindly Wedding Gift of 26th
arc h- lhls is a new money-and-trouble saving
idea The card also conveyed the intelligence of
the days _At Home,’ and so served a double
purpose. There is nothing, as a rule, so dreaded
by the newly-fledged wife in her honeycombdays as
the writing of a couple of hundred (or less) letters
to friends, setting forth in sweet tones her thanks
for the wedding gift, adding a word or two of her
ecstatic state of bliss. The Brunswick matron
sets an example that Sassiety at present scorns
but may yet appropriate.
“ A globe-trotter at present in the Big Smoke
writes, concerning the social position of Aus-
tralians who have gone to conquer the world of
London, that Australians are completely lost in
the thousands of great lights pouring their
millionaire radiance on that capital. ‘ The season ’
makes no difference to 99 out of 100 Australians
tasting life in Thackeray’s quarter. Unless you
a ? e lu t i )e t , llc c of , dukes > duchesses, and merinos
of that class, the ‘ season ’ comes and goes
un-noted. Australians are nowhere. Since the
gory fever has subsided and Patriotism is a dead
letter pretty well, the colonies are eschewed and
are deuced bad form, doncherknow ; they’made
that decent c happy Hopetoun throw it up,’ and so
on. Lady Clarke is the only soul of -Kangaroo
Land whose name manages to trickle, in any sort
of a.ll estimable way, beyond the coterie of Aus-
tralians ; and then but vaguely.
The demand for high chorus girls is on the in-
crease, and candidates for stage honors just now
face the music and the test examination in eleva-
tors. These become actually unbearable after an
hour’s walking in them, and the lifted heel pains
violently. So the ballet Peri is no sooner ‘passed ’
and out of sight of the theatre than she flies into
the nearest shop, and, with apologies to the
owner of it, slips her shoes off, and stows away
the ‘elevators. The one Melbourne man who
affects ‘ elevators ’ has often to remove them in his
legal office and when driving in his carriage. So
one needn’t wonder at the girls flinching.
“At Conductor Slapoffski’s second concert in
Melb. Town Hall, last Saturday, a large crowd
turned up to listen to the band interpreting a
symphony which seems to have caught Musical
Melbourne by the wool. The beauty of this little
piece is that of being up-to-date and as easy to
listen to as pretty, trumpery music, while giving
at the same time the gratified feeling
that one is really liking a ‘ classical ’ work.
’Tis said that Slap, doesn’t make any profit on
these concerts, full as the hall is, at the 35., 25.,
and Is. rates. Madame Slap, sang twice in a
dress re-calling a London sky, when a gleam of
apricot sunshine darts from a patch of watery-
blue sky and tinges the pale grey clouds with a
faint fawn color. A feature of the afternoon
was the new sliding trombone (Slap, brought
it out from England with him). It tele-
scopes in and out, a glittering mile, more or less, of
brass tubing. There are two parties in the con-
cert-going camp now. The Marshall-Hallites
uphold their grim-visaged high-priest as perfec-
tion, and the more heterodox barrack for the
newcomer. Slapoffski is a very lively time-
beater. While Mr. Hall leans his long figure
slowly to the left and right, holding up nis left
hand in a kind of Papal benediotion, his rival is
all over the shop.’
“Florence Young witnessed ‘Florodora’ from
the front row of the circle, Saturday night. She
wore black of glittersome material, with pink
rose trimmings. The many recently-married
chorus charmers, with their respective and respect-
able hubbies, rustled with a preponderance of
voluminous silks, like a forest of high tree-
tops in a storm. Palotta’s French fibre
and glace silk frock, in strawberry and ice-cream
tones, was the “ Florodora’s ” freshest plum. It
was a highly satisfying creation. Neither the
extreme new nor the old figure—a very charming
medium. With the mouth-watering pink frock
went a zig-zag hat, built to set off every angle of
the face, and colored in sunset pinks. Grace was
m high spirits, and rattled off her songs at express
speed,
“A paragraph last week, re Lady Rupert

to Children, said that the festive dame, ‘took the
chair at a Town Hall meeting when the Society
decided to enrich itself with the proceeds of the
.Y V t h ® wor ds ‘in the spirit’ had been

the par would have been, perhaps, a little more
obvious. Everybody knows that the president
did not take the chair in the flesh, or record her
personal vote for the Ball, unless she sent it by
cable Her present address is London, or there-
abouts.
The‘Ping-Pong blouse ’ is the novelty up-to-
date. . ihe accidents caused to silk bodices over
the ping-pong tables have been innumerable, and
at times quite awful. A strain on the racquet-arm

come forward with a new design to give the ping-
ponger every scope. It is an improvised Russian
roomy without being in any way bulky.
Wide bell sleeves go with it, so that the keen and
energetic she can fling her arms about in full
safety.
“Melb. women in the Big Smoke advise us of

A N.S.W. ecclesiastical pension of £4OO
falls in by the death of Dean Cowper.
Three N.S.W. Chief Justices—Forbes,
Dowling and Alfred Stephen —gave sons to the
Bench —two to the District Court, and one to the
Supreme.
In their time as students together in
Sydney University the largest prize-takers were
District Court Judge Murray (N.S.W.) and Chief-

The retirement of N.S. W. Justice Stephen
from the position of Puisne Judge, and accept-
ance of the position of Acting-Chief Justice,
peculiarly illustrates current State ideas on the
virtues of superannuation.
Mr. J. H. M. Abbott, whose book on the
S’African war has been so successful, has another
book —this time on ail Australian subject—nearly
finished for a London publisher. Mr. Abbott is
now attached to S.M. Herald staff.
Mrs. Ousby, perhaps the oldest resident
on the Lachlan River, died last week, aged 95
years. She was identified with Cowra since 1839,
and owned the Fitzroy Arms in that town when
Governor Fitzroy reigned in N.S.W.
Minister Kingston describes Lord Balfour
of Burleigh (now Secretary for Scotland), who
was offered the Governor-Generalship before
Hopetoun took it, as a “bluff, hearty, plain-
spoken man who ought to just suit Australia.”
Vic. ex-Premier Peacock says he did not
enjoy the worries of office, and feels glad to get
back to a comparatively quiet life. But he had,
all the same, the satisfaction of holding for a time
a billet which a lot of other people wanted badly.
Adye Douglas, the father of the Tasmanian
Bar, recently celebrated his 87th birthday. He
doesn’t use glasses, and is always on foot. I orty
years ago he went into partnership with George
Collins, and they have never separated up to date.
N.S.W. Premier John See now, in a
royally munificent way, distributes photos, of
himself “taken with” Hector Macdonald. John
See is fond of instancing Macdonald as a man
who, “like himself,” rose from obscurity by sheer
merit.
There used to be four members of Vic.
Supreme Court Bench who were beaten Parlia-
mentary candidates that never sat in the Legis-
lature-Williams, Holroyd, A’Beckett and
Webb. The death of Webb reduced the number
to three.
N.S.W., now without a Chief Justice, is
paying £7OOO on Chief Justice account. Darley,
on leave of absence, gets full pay ; and Stephen,
as locum tenens, receives a C.J.’s full salary.
Meanwhile, however, Stephen’s pension of £l2BO
is saved.
When Lord Tennyson temporarily suc-
ceeds Hopetoun as Gov.-General, he will have
£lO,OOO salary from the Commonwealth and £4OOO
from S.A. He is not given to lavish expenditure,
but leaves all that sort of thing to Mayor Cohen,
in Adelaide.
Sydney Sunday Kitchen Girl kicks her
drabbled petticoat at mention of ex-Governor
Carington as successor to Hopetoun. He is a
pro-Boer, says the Kitchen Girl, and she can’t
forgive him that, even though he was a good
hanging Governor.
Theo. Fink (Vic.) smashed himself politi-
cally by his sudden desertion of the M’Lean
Govt, (of which lie was an honorary member) at
the end of the first week of its existence. Tw t o
Ministries have, since been formed, but he has
never again even been in the running for a port-
folio.
Victoria’s Coronation was a reminder of
the fresh-blowing rose in the morning, gemmed
with dew drops, and unfolded in the sun ; but
King Edward’s is of faded roses and stale cham-
pagne. He comes languid and indifferent, even
as Horace Walpole was when he came into the
inheritance of his Earldom.
After the Peacock, the Turncoat
Ministry. Plucky Foster got off his sick bed to
vote straight—for the Convention Bill—and lies
dead. Bent, Taverner, Shiels and Kirton all
started behind Liberal leaders, ratted, and now
reap their reward. Bent changed sides on the
very first vote he gave in the House after his
return from well-earned retirement.
According to cable, Premier Seddon is at
his old game in Loudon, delivering speeches
“bristling with statistics.” When in England
the last time he was accounted a most odious
bore ; he would on the slightest excuse maunder
for three-quarters of an hour after dinner, the
while yelling at the top of his voice, until he had
almost to be dragged down by the coat-tails.
At a big Melbourne woman’s meeting,
called to congratulate the Federal Parliament on
the passing of the womanhood-suffrage measure,
Senator Dawson occasioned a tired feeling by
drawing attention to the S. Australian senators as
proof positive of the foolishness of the charge that
women would return only good-looking men. The
S.A. senators are certainly a most homely lot.
Brigadier-General Gordon, who goes from
Adelaide to command the Vic. militia, began his
soldiering as drill instructor of the S.A. mounted
police about 20 years ago. He was born at Xeres,
m Spain, where his father was British Consul,
just 46 years ago; his wife is a daughter of
the late Edward Fitzgerald, of the Castlemaine
Brewery. Gordon served long ago in the Royal
Artillery.
The lives of the late Dean Cowper and of
his father, born in 1780, take us baok to the time^
when heated arguments went on in England as
to whether Botany Bay was habitable, i
was no thought at that period of making it a
convict depot. Pitt, Fox and other notables did
not know what to do with the territory, bir
Joseph Banks urged that it should be colonise
by small farmers.
Guy Boothby is steadily working his way
down the ladder. His latest story is running in a
penny weekly—and there is a big and recognised
gap between its public and that of a sixpenny
monthly. Boothby, shrewd tradesman as ever,
knows all about that, and, dropping his Princes
and Doctors, has called the tale simply, Wno
killed Connie Burk?” A frank appeal to the
lovers of blood and mystery.
Miss Alice Stephen, who was buried at the
same time as her brother, Mr. M. H. Stephen, was
appointed N.S.W. Acting Chief-Justice, worked
for years as amanuensis to her father, Allred
Stephen, in recording his reminiscences of the
early days of Sydney—of Australia generally. 1 lie
ex-C.J. used to sit in his chair and dreamily talk
in monologue, while Miss Stephen wrote for bare
life. Is that MS. ever to see the light ?
Still one more use has been found for the
M.P. Zeehan (Tas.) School of Mines found it
necessary that some of its working-man students
should be coached in the day-school primers ; but
as it didn’t have the funds to hire a professional
pedagogue, ex-Attorney-Gen. Urquhart, the local
member, was called upon, and now he spends his
evenings explaining that though in politics 2 and A
make 5, in school the c’rect answer is 4.
A much-coveted position is the president-
ship of N.S.W. Farmers’and Settlers’ Association
(vacated by the death of Gunning F. Plunkett),
as the holder is regarded as certain of being on the
list should any more M’s.L.C. be appointed.
Vice-President MTnerny looks probable, but may
have to knock-under to J. L. Trifle, a young far-
mer and journalist (strange combination), whose
knowledge of the State land-laws is unexcelled by
anyone.
Mr. W. Villeneuve Smith, barrister, who
died last week as the result of a tram accident in
Adelaide, was a brother of ex-Chief-Justice
Yilleneuve Smith of Tasmania. He was a clever
lawyer, possessed of a most vitriolic tongue, and
was the hero of many police-court episodes. He
was imprisoned for “contempt” 26 years ago for
suggesting that a S.M. was too kind to his
brothers (one is now a Senator) who practised in
his Court.
In N.S.W. civil servants are supposed to
retire at 65. In S. A. the age limit is 70,
and even at that age there are many officials
worth more than any younger men who could be
suggested in theirplaces —Deputy P.M.G. Charles
Todd, Sheriff Boothby, Registrar-General Turner,
and police-magistrate Stow among them. The
sensible system is to keep men at work while they
have the will and the work in them. Some men
are young at 70; others old at 40.
Thus that fashionable journal, the London
Tailor and Cutter :
We are sorry to note the Colonial Secretary is develop-
ing quite a stoop, and we fear he is losing some of his old-
time smartness in style. As we critically examined his
garments in wear we could not but feel that conservatism
was sadly apparent, for there is much in them that is not
up-to-date, and many details that called for adverse
criticism. The coat worn was a double-breasted frock,
made of grey worsted ; the lapels were plain and heavy.
The trousers were wide in the legs, and none too shapely.
There’s probably little real malice after all
in good old Sydney Pastor Dill Macky’s uproarious
anti-Romanism. Dill is an amiable gentleman with
a strong vein of vanity; after he had been for a year
Presbyterian Moderator (with the right, as such,
to show his calves, just like an Anglican
bishop), he insisted on the privilege
of showing his calves for ever(they
are not very special calves).
The Watchman repre-
sents his display of
mental calves.
SENATOR GLASSEY.
The transference of the Post-Office from
State to Commonwealth has saved several S. A.
officers, who otherwise would have gone out under
the Septuagenarian Sacrifice Bill. Deputy P. M. G.
Todd, now 76, has been Super, of S.A. Tele-
graphs for 47 years, and P.M.G. (S.A. had no
Ministerial P.M.G.) for 31 years. He had his
scientific training at Greenwich Observatory.
Mr. Todd’s reconi is, in a way, equalled by that
of one of his officers, who has been at Port Ade-
laide for 47 years, and now retires unasked.

“ Huia ” writes from London to The
Bulletin :
Wild was the excitement and weird the consternation
in the Maoriland Agent-General’s office a few days back.
For once -where his imposing importance is concerned—
King Seddon had been smitten with an economical turn.
Shorn of details, Bun Tuck has sent his levee coat on
before him, with the idea of having it altered into a full-
dress Court coat. The knee-breeches, &c., are alike for
each, but the Court coat is a much more ornate affair.
But the chalk-and-shears expert said that the alteration
was impossible—far better that the Maori King should
have a Court coat made and his levee coat refurbished.
Then Pember Reeves and Kennaway fell into a deep
quandarj'—what to do ? Should a£s cable be sent Dick,
or should the policy' of “hang the expense ” prevail and
Dick be bought a real new Court coat? The office in
Victoria-st. was long at a standstill, and may be so now,
for whichever is done what ivill Dick say ?
The M.L. Baruum of Imperialism care-
fully engineered his notoriety through S’Africa.
This, from a Durban alderman, is the key to his
methods:—
Mr. Burne did not think Mr. Seddon would be averse
to receiving an address, otherwise he would not have
telegraphed the date of his arrival.
In the Coronation procession Mr. Barton and Mr.
Laurier are to come first, with Mr. Seddon and
the Piemier of Newfoundland following meekly
afterwards —Australia’s little tail and Canada’s
little tail. Mr. Seddon must he reflecting
bitterly that now indeed the war is over
and gratitude is dead. Newfoundland is the
bleak little island that lives on cod-fish, and whose
politics smell fishy to keep the eod company.
Seddon tries to pose as the new empire builder,
and he is to be put along with an obscure person
who, as likely as not, will have a sample of fish-bait
in his pocket to show to Seddon as they go along.
A Maoriland correspondent :
Good old Gresley Lukin, whose staunchly democratic
instincts were proved years ago, has earned the reputa-
tion of being the only incorruptible editor in Maoriland.
He is absolutely the only one who has not bowed the
knee to the political Tsa.il in the person of Gory Dick.
The common or garden variety' of Liberal paper, carefully
nurtured by Govt, advertising, is still solid for the alleged
ex-digger, while the once-abusive Tory organs have
become absolutely' crawlsome in their adulation of his
bloodthirstiness, which they miscall Imperialism. The
otherwise parochial Post, of Wellington, under Lukin’s
direction, condemns the “ great Englishman ” as a sham
Liberal and a shoddy Imperialist. Lukin, sitting in the
King’s gate, is a veritable Mordecai to the Maoriland
Hainan. As Dick could not order a gallows for his
enemy, he tried another method of silencing him.
Through an obliging intermediary he hinted to the
“ grizzly ” one that if he became a good hoy' he stood a
good show of being made a C.M.G., “ for distinguished
service on the press.” At which, no doubt, Lukin
snorted derisively. By the way, how Lukin must have
groined when lie saw that his old chum and fellow
Soei list, W. P. Reeves, had been persuaded to don
Windsor fool-dress and kotow to Emperor Ned !
A wild Tasmanian-Irishuian, who lately
tripped to Ireland, via Rome, tells the local (Tas.)
paper that in the visitors’ book at the Pantheon
lie wrote his name “and a couple of lines of
poetry.” The cautious Tas. editor suppressed the
poetry, as “Italy was a friendly power.” A
Bulletin man has been favored with a copy of
the “poetry,” with the necessary explanation.
Poetry first, as written in the Pantheon :
Victor Emanuel, unrepented, robed the Pope and lyed,
And for that reason God damned him when he died.
P. O’P., Tasmania. Old Ireland for Ever 1
The explanation, as supplied by Mr. O’P. :
When Victor emanuel and Garribaldy Robed the Pope
might was made right, but before devine law it was open
daylight highway robery. And when Garibaldy visited
England the Gladstone Ministery honerd him with bank-
wits for being the Dliver of freedom to Italy. And when
John Mitchell and Maher wanted to free Ireland with
more right than Victer emanul they were to be hung and
quarterd. So what do you call this ?
Only another injustice to Ireland revenged
(howly Moses !) in the Pantheon !
The United Typewriter and Supplies Co.,
one of the largest concerns manufacturing type-
writers, seems to be getting more of its share of
the world’s business. One of its machines, the
“Yost,” was favoured recently by the Indian
Government with an order for one hundred and
twenty machines. In addition to this their
Austrian representative now reports the sale of
five hundred “ New Century ” Typewriters for use
on the Government Railways. An important
fact is that these two are record orders for the
world, and, what is more important in the eyes of
the Company, were obtained in competition with
all the leading makes. Australian buyers can
obtain both of these machines from the Company’s
office in Sydney, Melbourne and Perth.*

Department of Agriculture only three years ago :

the grass was good too. I saw blue-grass country where
?“l. could J? ave Put a mowing-machine and cut away to
„°n dt L rB ' a ? y am °unt of other valuable
grasses which could have been served in this way. And
what an opportunity to save and store! How many
splendid haystacks might have been built this season, in
the Central district, of feed which may possibly be
wanted next year ; and yet almost the whole of it was left
to be cut by the hard frost, and then burnt off. . . It
seemed an extraordinary thing to me that, with hay and
chaff at starvation prices in the drought-stricken West,
fanners in the more favored parte could not see the value
of this material. And, even apart from that, there is the
danger in front of them of a drought coming in their own
part of the district at any time, and I am of the firm
°P 1 !?i. 0n kuat. if a drought set in now, the great majority
of the settlers in the very parts where this splendid
growth has occurred would have starving stock in no
time.
What hope is there for any set of farmers—
especially in a dry country—who throw away
chances like this, and then pray for rain, and
want fodder carried to them at the public
expense ?

It is the sort of men who say that squatters
must make what they can out of the country in the
good years,, and sell sheep or let them perish in
the bad (vide that old squatter in S.M. Herald
last week), who have made pastoral Australia
what it is. Many a one more patriotic has been
shot as a traitor, and many a one more humane
been hanged by the neck till he was dead.
Had half the money that has been taken out of
the country 50 miles on either side of the railway
between Narandera and Hay been returned to it
in improvements, there need be no stock dying
there to-day. Plenty of water has gone down the
river to supply all wants, and what sort of a face
would there have been on the land if two trees
had been planted for every one destroyed? If
there is no sense of responsibility, or even of rudi-
mentary humanity, in the occupation of the back
country, let us pray hard against the rain, let the
wilderness conditions become absolute, and so
avoid a recurrence of recent and present feebly-
realised horrors.
“J.G.F.”: Pretty enough to city people
is the sight of a well-trained dog taking three
sheep through a labyrinth of hurdles and
maltese crosses, and so forth, but this does
not prove the dog of any practical use.
In fact, I would not give a rap for one
of these “tricky” dogs for station
work or droving. The rough, wiry
sheep-dog, without any preten-
sions to aristocratic breeding,
would knock spots off the “ fancy-
bred ” brute in a paddock or on a
road. I know a cocky who has a
mongrel that saves him the cost of
a musterer at shearing-time. When
he wants sheep in he goes to the
shed-door and sings out “Bring
’em, boy;” then the dog makes off,
musters the paddock, brings the
sheep to the yard, puts them in,
and, if no one is about, lies down in the gateway.

Renmark, South Australia’s one irrigation
colony, despite the handicap put upon it by its
Chaffey origin, keeps moving ahead. It lately
made up account sales for its last season’s cr0p —
£29,274. To that it has moved by easy stages
from £6878 in ’95. Last season’s output of dried
apricots reached 140 tons, but that was the result
of a phenomenal crop. The raisin crop is now
always well over 100 tons.

“ Tag ” on irrigation :
Re Ernest Favenc’s remarks about watering the heart
of Australia by dams and locks of one sort or another
What the settler, and the will-be settler, and the man
who is going to make Australia, want to know is, how to
get the water profitably on to his 500-acre grass paddock
and his 200-acre farm, and what would be the cost per
100 acres. Not one of these wild, wandering water-
theorists state how we are to water our farms after they
have got their dam full of water—whether per medium
of a water-can, a la flower-garden, or with a 2000 h.p.
engine and pipes.

“ Tonga ” : “ Shaker ” (B. 14/9/’0l) says
that in the Far North it is rare to see a male
nigger that is not a model of physical gym-
metry. Well, I have struck every bit of
country where gold was known to exist
from Cooktown to the Batavia River, and
have come across a large assortment of
blacks, but, with the exception of a few
fair specimens at the latter place and on
the beche-de-mer stations, I have found
them a miserable, attenuated lot of
wretches.
“ L.L. : Travelling, lately, on the main
stock-route, between Taroom and Springsure (Q.),
I caught sight of a beast lying in the scrub. Rode
over, and found it was a young oow, which had
been in tip-top condition. It had been thrown,
pithed, properly bled, partly skinned, and had
about 301 b. of the sirloin cut out, the skin being
afterwards drawn over the gap and the car-
case turned other side up. This practice is now
not uncommon out back.

The recent rain has not been an un-
mixed blessing to some Vic. farmers. On the
plains between Ararat and Hamilton, now being
cultivated by drought-beaten mallee-farmers, the
rain has put some water in the swamps, and
thousands of mountain-ducks are arriving, as they
do every season. This year they find splendid
feeding in the adjacent newly-sown wheat fields.
Writer saw some hundreds on one paddock other
day.
Thus a Riverina (N.S.W.) pioneer :
The present drought recalls ’5l-62. We had no rain for
12 months, except occasional light showers. Not a live
hoof remained on the Murrumbidgee, except working
stock.. But, when the change came, white men saw the
first big flood, when the old town of Gundagai was swept
away. I believe history’s going to repeat itself.

‘‘ Basac ” : Re rabbits and oat headlands

“ that tired feeling,” and be bluffed by an oaten
headland, but in the Wimmera (Vic.), energetio
bunny will industriously work through a mixed
crop—picking out the wheat, and leaving the oats
untouched. Have known rabbits when hungry to

above another.

The disease which decimated the domestic
oat in E. Riverina has now attacked the
indigenous ’possum, and is completing the work
of the insatiable trapper. By the way, the exotio
bunny is apparently indifferent to disease and
drought and the carefully-devised plans of man.
Evidently bunny has a mission on earth 1

“ Oktis ” : Not much mystery about the
discovery of a swarm of dead bees in the heart of
a bluegum (8., 26/4/’O2). All kinds of gum-trees
have a tendency to heal over a scar with bark. I
have known the limb of a bluegum, 6in. through,
to die and fall off, but in a few years the bark had
grown oyer the hole left by the limb, leaving no
trace of its. having ever existed. The bees
probably died in their tree when the bark
had closed the entrance-hole.

One winter I kept alive a cow, which was
down, by giving her her own milk with that
of another cow. Cows which have been “poddied”
as calves will drink milk whenever they can get
it. I also had a bull that would be at a milk-

trumpeting up the river-bed, scaring the cattle
badly. He missed the mail-coach, but hit a
terrace and died. The showmen cursed a lot and

when the carcase came down, gave it a dressing
of quicklime and stacked it on the shingle. Six

Writes “Titus”:—
One of the first cases to come before the N.S.W. Arbi-
tration Court is that of the Undertakers’ Assistants, who
want their hours fixed at 60 per week : wages of shopmen
and coffin-makers to be 50s. per week, and yardmen
(what is an undertaker’s yardman ?) 425.; and some
definite arrangement about casual labor. The Boss-
Ghouls reply that owing to the habit people have of
dying at unseasonable times, and of remaining alive one
week and then perishing in batches the next, it is impos-
sible to fix hours. Also, that when there is a rush of
business they have to employ whomsoever is available.
But they offer to pay the casual employee 2s. for “ mind-
ing vehicle,” and as an undertaker’s horse is a calm
animal 2s. worth of minding should be sufficient for him.
If he needs more than that he should be chlorofprmed.
Also, they suggest for “ carrying corpse, 2s. with railway
ticket.” Apparently this is irrespective of the weight
of deceased. I have cause to speak feelingly on
this head. Once, and only once, in my younger and
wilder days, I “ undertook " a funeral.' There was no
doctor obtainable in time, but self and Bill and “ Yorky
—there is a “ Yorky” on every decayed goldfield in Aus-
tralia—did their best for the sufferer, the treatment con-
sisting mostly of applying hot water bandages and killing
the dog for keeping the patient awake. When all was
over “ Yorky ” walked 20 miles over the mountains to
interview a settler suspected of being a J.P., and to ask
if he could give any necessary authority for burial.
The settler wasn’t a J.P., but he wrote out a statement
that our party were all respectable characters, and he had
no doubt had done all that was possible. Then writer
and Bill and Yorky buried a friend weighing fully 16st.,
and writer wouldn’t do it again for 25.. nor for five times
the amount. The vehicle wasn’t “ minded,” for it didn’t
require it. A statement of the case was sent in to the
nearest authority, and two weeks later a policeman came
up and drank all the party’s whisky, and ate nearly
everything in the hut.

“ Nymsie ”: Last season I shot a big,
black, yellow-bellied swamp snake, and, opening
him, found he contained 17 frogs, two lizards, two
young minahs and the broken shells of two crows’
®ggs. _ Same day I shot a sparrowhawk with a
snipe in his talons, and put up a fox ; but he was
too slick for either dogs or gun. In his covert I
found the bones of lambs, hares, rabbits, ’possums,
bandicoots, poultry, black ducks, quail, fish,
lizards and snakes, and feathers enough to fill a
mattress. Next I shot a yellow iguana, inside
whioh I found two chickens (fortnight old) a
broken duck’s egg, an apricot, and a young
’possum.
MASON’S REPUTATION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Spriggy Mason’s reputation was the highest on The Fly,
What he didn’t know of diggin’ wasn’t worth a fellow
knowin’.
There was only one to undertake to teach him how an*
why—
It was Mrs. bloomin’ Spriggy, who’d a hearty way of blow-
in’
She could whip the blessed bo-yangs off the brightest
kind of man
That had handled pick and shovel or had shaken up a
pan.
Spriggy Mason wasn’t so high, but his wife was tall and
broad.
She was not the kind of woman that you’d call domesti-
cated—
She was nothin’ but a digger. Her opinion of her lord
As an expert was the meanest, an’ was always freely
stated.
So, whatever Sprig was doin’, an’ whatever he might say,
Mrs. Mason said the other thing, an’ went the other way.
Spriggy took a heap o’ pride in what he did an’ all he
knew,
But his wife was just as proud of what she called her
intooition.
Truth to tell, for all their gifts, an’ all their grit an’ graft,
the two
Had had tough old times for years gone, an’ their temporal
condition
At the present date was dicky, for their credit at the
store
Was suspended, an’ the wolf was often snarlin’ at the
door.
Touchin’ anythin’ but minin’ they were best o’ friends on
earth,
But disputed like ole Fury 'bout the leads an' indica-
tions,
And, when Spriggy started sinkin’ down the creek,
Matilda’s mirth
Was a bellow of derision, an’ their subsequent orations,
With their arms gestickerlatin’, an’ their langwidge
runnin’ high,
Lent a litterairy interest to our evenin’s on The Fly.
As was nat’ral, Mrs. Mason pegged a claim out up the
creek,
And her husband said that women was the fools of all
creation ;
But he changed his tune along about the middle o’ the
week,
When the field was knocked demented by Matilda’s great
sensation.
She had struck deposits banked there by them pre-historic
floods,
And was rootin’ up the nuggets, and a-washin’ ’em like
spuds!
When the diggers called on Spriggy, just to see what
they could see,
And to give congratulations, he was sorter paraletic,
Es if stricken, with a pan half full o’ nuggets on his
knee.
Down his cheeks the tears were rollin’, and he eyed us so
pathetic
That we gathers round, astonished, and we murmurs:
“ What’s amiss ? ’’
“ H °ly smoke,” he says, “I know Fll never hear the last
o' this/ ”

* ‘ Silverriiine ” : Be horses pulling by their
tails. Prof. Hyland, horse-training expert,
maintained that a horse could pull more that way
than when harnessed-up, and in demonstration
hitched a small pony to a bag on which a man was
seated. The pony was unable to move the load;
but'when made fast to the bag by a rope tied to
his tail he shifted it easily enough. Again : A
coach-driver (pupil of said Hyland) had two colts
stick him up in a bit of a causeway, and, after
vainly trying to get them to pull, he at . last
hitched them on by their tails to the ’bus with a
rope. He then “ got to them,” and managed to
run up to time.

“ S.S.”: The unemployed who refuses to
go into the country is regarded as a loathly person
who looks for work in order to know how to avoid
it. I know one who, after much tribulation,
went from Melbourne to take a job on a vineyard.
There he came into cut-throat competition with
particularly cheap and nasty Italians, and. got
12s. 6d. a week. His work all through the biting
cold of the last few weeks has been scouring and
scraping vats—a lovely job. The man in the vat
works in a nude state, standing in cold water,
scraping the sides of the great tubs, more cold
water being soused in from above every now and
again. Result —rheumatics, sciatica, lumbago,
and hospital—the result of pursuing the “natural”
industries of this great country. This 12s. 6d.
toiler has a wife and family in Melbourne.

The story of a bush tragedy :
“ You fellows talk about danger,” said the new arrival,
dumping his swag just where the next-comer would fall
over it. “ Why, when I was in the Gulf country the nigs,
were that thick that when a man split a log, ten to one
he’d find a blackfellow inside. But we had ’em dead
cowed, and they never give us any trouble till one day
the fellows went away to a race-meetin’ ’bout 30 miles
off. I said I’d stay and look after the place, lest the
niggers might try to shake things. So on the Saturday
the boys got their horses, and started after they’d ’ad
their supper. Jes’ as they was goin’, Bill Hackett sez, ‘ I
don’t like leavin’ you alone ’ere,’but I tells’im I reckoned
I could see after meself, although I ivas over sixty.
“ Well, away they goes, and I starts to clean up the
hut and put things straight for Sunday, when all on a
suddint my ole dorg starts tew smell roun’kind er nervous
like, and I knew that the niggers ’ad seen the chaps go
away and leave me alone ; but I ’ad a revolver and a shot-
gun o’’Bill’s. Presently two or three spears comes thro’
the bark roof, and a couple more follows, so I takes the
ole guti and opens the winder and lets fly inter the scrub
with both barrels, and the way they yelped I guess that
shot got lodsrin’s. Then they come with a rush; but I
kep’ ’em off for a quarter-of-an-hour with ther revolver.”
“ I say,” said
young Mick,
from his seat
near the fire,
“ ’ow many
chambers ’ad
that shootin
iron of yours ? ”
The old man
gave him a
look of scorn,
and resumed.
“The spears
was rattlin’ on
the iron roof
like hailstones”
—(“thought
yer said it was
bar k,” from
Micky). “ Then
they got a log
and started to
batter down
ther door, so I
grabbed the
hax and waited
till it give.
Then with a
rush they come
at me, but I
laid ’em out in
’eaps, till the
h ax - a n dle
broke, and
they closed wi’
me.”
The old man
stopped and
raised, with
shaking hand,
the glass the
landlord had
filled. Then he
drew his hand
across his brow
to clear away
the sweat that
had gathered
with his ex-
citement, and
his listeners
gave vent to
their suspense
in gasps. Then
Micky asked—
“An’ what did
yer do thei
boss?”
“ Died like a
man! ’’shouted
the old chap,
and, seizing his
swag, started
out on the
moonlit road.

after three years’

comes to Brisbane to

to have £2O or £3O

In Ebagoolah district (Q.), recently, a
miner was found in the last stage of exhaustion by
some aborigines, having been lost in the bush 20
days, without food. The blacks cooked some
yams and kangaroo-flesh, which they tried to
make him eat, but, as he was too weak to do so,
they made a rude chair of vines and saplings,
placed him in it, and started for Ebagoolah, 30
miles off. After a time, the man became too weak to
sit up, and the blacks made from vines a hammock
in which he could lie. When, after a painful
journey, Ebagoolah was at length reached, the
miners got up a subscription for the blacks, and,
in return for their rescue-work, they were loaded
up with flour, beef, and tobacco.
AN UNDESIRABLE ASIATIC.
They were holding sweet converse in a retired spot, when the new

A STUDY IN CLAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I watched her slender fingers form
A piece of common sculptor's clay
Into a little laughing face
Brimful of life, and love, and grace,
As any fay.
I took her hand within mine own,
And stood in blissful reverie ,*
How should I dare to her impart
The hope that stirred my inmost heart
With ecstasy!
What matter that my youth had fled ?
Young love was yet within recall;
Surely he dwelt within those eyes
Which, gazing out in sweet surprise
Held me in thrall •
I asked her would she mould my life*
She straightway crushed me where I stood;
These were her words—to be exact—
•* Sir, when the clay is old and tracked^
It is no good."

ANSWERS to CORRESPONDENTS.
No notice will be taken of communications insufficiently
stamped. Name and address must appear on MS.
No liability is undertaken in any case re contribu-
tions voluntarily submitted, whether sent by post or
handed in ; and in no case will MS. be returned un-
less stamps (of any State) accompany.
J.R.E. : (1) “ Last Night ” and all the other
verses of Morant have been collected and printed in
book form (obtainable from Bulletin office). (2) If you
commission a bookseller to get Dobson’s verse he would
send to England for it, if it isn’t available in Australia....
Slam : The “ time to write poetry ” is when you feel you
must write or burst: even then it is often better to burst.
....Gerald B. : “The parting word,” “the tears’ hot
flow,” “ thy memory my guiding star,” &c., &c. Tiresome
potted phrases, and tiresome verses mechanically made
of them.. ..Spring : Cecil Rhodes is dead now.... Jack:
It is sheer cruelty and injustice for the law to punish a
man for escaping from gaol, if he has used no violence in
getting away. The desire for liberty is one of the noblest
instincts of man. When a prisoner escapes the State
should perhaps punish the gaoler for negligence, cer-
tainly not the prisoner for his being human Sans
Remo : But that ping-pong picture was distinctly labelled
a “ variant,” and was presented as being vastly more
spirited than its original.... Hamer : None quite up ;
“ Woman in Black, nearly. Verses smooth, but lacking
in strength and individuality... .Glenara : Verse indiffer-
ent; prose-sketch too trifling... .0. Scrib. : You write
about your verses : “ I don’t think you’ll fancy them,
but, recollect, a great many nice girls read your paper.
You mostly cater for men and ‘new women.’ Still I
doat on The Bulletin.” And your verses are just what
a very nice girl would write, and will be published if ever
we issue a special edition for nice girls only Savage
Wilde: “ Battle Song ” is the sweetest little tame poem
of the month, and fed out of the hand first time
of asking Charles 0. : We don’t like the man
who calls his stuff “ doggerel ” any more than
the one who labels it “ a noble poem.” There is a
dangerous conceit in the affectation of humility....
M.L. : Your work shows a good deal of skill, and with
more compression it should succeed. “ May,” however,
too closely follows the plot of a Wilson Barrett play
C.W.B. :We don’t “ appoint correspondents.” There are
quite enough drunken liars rushing round already, wav-
ing huge notebooks and exhibiting themselves as incar-
nations of The Bulletin. .. .Milky W. :It has some very
strong points, but the central idea, that of outrage, on the
details of which you linger, quite precludes publication—
W.A.: Your idea of a State-owned newspaper, with “ one
editor each—for the Government, the Opposition, the
National Ass. or rich man’s party, the Labor Party, the
Single-Taxers, and the Socialists ; each editor to be paid
the same salary, and to be allowed no other position of
emolument; each editor to be allowed equal space and
the same type for political matter; each editor to be
elected by his party, and no person to be allowed to
belong to more than one party at the same time, nor to
vote for its editor unless he has been a registered mem-
ber of the party for 12 months or more,” strikes us only
as richly humorous. Why ignore the Country Party, and
the John Norton Party, and the Christian Socialists, and
the Vegetarians, and the Anti-Vaccinators? Why not
give them, too, an editor, with the same space and the
same salary? First development of your scheme would
be that the whole country would have to knock off all
other work to print and produce the State newspaper; next
step, every man in the country would be an editor of a
column in a paper of 2530 pages which never came out
O.L.W. : The right way out of the nobbler-price difficulty
is for publicans to serve by measure, instead of handing
the bottle. If they can’t afford to give so much of a
certain whisky, say, for sixpence, then let them give less
—or charge more for the standard quantity C.L.P.:
Lord Salisbury, we are quite sure, never said anything of
the sort. He only stayed in Bendigo for a very little
while, and never took a hand in mining Mikoro : No
use sending dense news-clips, the substance of which
mostly reaches us in other forms from other quarters.
We want , condensed comment, not masses of print
Manx : You are the victim of a megalomaniacal delusion.
You are quite welcome to charge The Bulletin with
theft, provided you disclose the whole of the facts....
Nym. : You write too much and too sloppily. The
Bulletin isn’t a 40,000-acre squattage—V.L.P. : Another
ton of alleged poetry. We only want from you, say,
2cwt. monthly ; never send more than 561 b. at any one
time....Talanoa: 8000 words; Bulletin extreme about
3000... .Walgett: Authorities are so evenly divided on
the point that it is usual, before starting, to decide which
hand shall be considered the better J.P.M. : In point
of membership the Manchester Unity 1.0.0. F. comes
first, then Grand United 0.0. F,, and the Druids
third. Can’t give their respective degrees of
solvency for want of up-to-date information
Worri Y: But why shouldn’t David Syme be a prosperous
dairy-farmer and fruitgrower? Are the foods that he
produces to be allowed to rot in order that “ legitimate ”
farmers may have the trade? What is the difference
between a “ legitimate ” dairy-farmer and a Syme who
farms for profit? And isn’t the newspaper man who
opens up the country a more valuable citizen than the
capitalist who doesn’t ?... Agnostic : Have no recollection
of the photo in question.... Bullaman : There are people
of that name in Melbourne Basalt: Write more
legibly, to give yourself a “ show.”.. ..Tamata: You
surely didn’t expect to “have” us with such clumsy
“fakes.” Resit: Laboriously humorous Enyab :It
certainly is crude, but there’s hope for you in the fact that
you know it is James S. : Fairly graphic, but lacks in-
terest... .R.A.K.: To hand.. ..C.M.A. : Will consider....
J.O.R : Not bad, but doesn’t suit Bulletin.... San Remo:
Don’t be so long-winued and leave more interlinear space.
....Casino: Thanks; it’s funny and characteristic....
W.F. : The fact that a young cub of no importance is
“ spooning ” a waitress who laughs at him does not in-
terest The Bulletin. There are several Melb. organs
which deal in such things... .J.F. : Even now you give us
no proof of his alleged death.... Zadig : Will print....
Kodak : Your lens is too small Bow-side : Bowed out.
Guy T. : Your poetry is only remarkable for the fact
that you spell “my” me D. Rover: Hopeless to
send a verse hinging on a pun on soul and sole Cooee :
A tame imitation of “Dagonet” rhymes Shranee:
You’ve far to travel to acceptance goal J.G.D. : Same
thought put more forcibly before R.S. : “The notes
you ought to write ” are not nearly so important as the
verses you ought not to write. You spoil yourself by
attempting- too big an output G.M. : “Song of the
Battery” too halting : needs to go with a rush and a
roar... .Andy : Not up 1.8 : Just misses... .S.C.B. :
An acceptable Coronation verse hasn’t come yet B.S. :
Peace-poem belated The Hermit : Name and address?
....Reise : Italian yarn not in our line.... Marie Blaas :
The epigrams show thought, but as a rule are not
polished enough; one or two usable... .J.P. (M.L.) :
Merely album-verse M.S. : Not a sob, nor even a sigh
in your threnody on the blacks Y. S. Long : Not up to
mark....F. Rad. : “Dooley’s Pipe” is smoking in the
office fire.. . .Ajax : All quite unsuitable... .Frances :
Clever, but, after all, only diluted Caudle Maggie :
Belated Emu : Too much after Marie Corelli
Thomas Marks : All the same, the pictures “touched the
spot.” Commercial :We challenge you, or anybody
else, to show that The Bulletin ever changed its
opinion for money or money’s worth, or accepted
subsidy in any form to advocate any cause
Bob R. : Rather aimless sketch. Black Duck:
Obviously juvenile work, but not without promise
F.W.W. : Inclined to be sloppy.... Albar : Pen-name too
like another contributor’s—“ Alpar.” Get a name all
your own D.R. Over : Neither up to mark... Nymoi :
“Strut” not strong enough... .J.IL : Some merit, hut
too long C.L. : Shows promise; worth while trying
again Deckhand: Emphatically no W.J. (Vic.):
Nice album verse C.L.L. : A parody _ must be
very bright to tempt us A.P. : Uni. stories
all familiar; verse not up 0.A.J.: “Tintown”
is some good, but not good enough S.T. :
Seems to be your ambition to write 17yds. of poetry
weekly ; it’s our ambition that some day you will write
no more R.S. : “Choristers” a good subject, but it
doesn’t go with that metre T.H.M. : Much melody
spoilt by an irritating oscillation between humorous and
serious verse Voice from the Bush : (1) You ask, “Is
it charitable to impute evil to those prominently before
the public ? ” Not always. That is why The Bulletin
has protested against the evil your crowd so persistently
imputed to Kruger and others. (2) When did The Bulletin
advocate giving Canada to the U.S., or India to Russia?
These things only exist in your diseased imagination. (3)
What othercountries have you lived in that you aresodead
sure on the subject of that freedom, and do you even know
what European countries have or have not a press censor-
ship ? That off-hand way of assuming that every country
save England has a press censorship is very convenient—
and very stupid. (4) The terms granted to the Boers,
though an enormous climb-down from the old “ uncondi-
tional surrender ” brag, were harder than those granted
by Germany to France, by Russia to Turkey, by Prussia
to Austria—in fact, almost the last time one white nation
demanded absolute and complete annexation as the
price of peace was the case of Poland. There is
considerable humor in your wild talk of whole-
sale annexation as “unparalleled magnaminity.” "
Kiwi : Has not the type-writer yet reached M.L. ? You
are very hard to read... .Buzzy :No thanks for profanity.
Send it to the Dead Bird, or some other animal of that
character R.A.K. : We’re rather off allegories
Interested : But he doesn’t give you something for noth-
ing. He wants three stamps, at all events. Whether he
wants anything more we don’t know Wombat :
Believe your Tasmanian Reform League is largely engi-
neered by the V.D.L. Co. ; and anything it is connected
with is worth leaving a10ne.... Alpha : Received....
Reluese (or something) : “ In Memoriam” has a stumblii g
and uncertain metre. Some lines were evidently com-
posed by a camel while hastening over very rough ground.
Henry P. : Your admiration of that gentleman
would probably diminish if you knew that he is
absent from his office on an average six or eight months
per annum, when the work you so much admire is done
by a subordinate who gets no credit for it One Eye :
Too far-fetched Robt. W. (M.L.): Over-prolix. Pars
should be terse and pithy Chasselas : Not surprising.
The average J.P. would be a howling farce if his ignorance
didn’t often make him a bit of a tragedy. A fool is more
dangerous than a villain any day Chapparal : Good
bit of real life, but hardly up to mark as a story....
JB.D. : Has rough merit, but is too awkwardly-versed....
Fact: Can’t see anything in it... .G.S.E.D. : Not up to
standard Caro: Pretty in places, but feeble in the
main.. ..Yaidie : Not bad in its way, but quite off our
track.
If Chamberlain wishes to secure the
future of a British S’Africa he should devise
some means for making the young British
adventurer who goes out there take unto himself a
white wife instead of a black or yellow concubine.
The young Dutchman marries a white girl early
in life and rears a white family. The young
Britisher, in many cases, goes out with the idea of
making money as quickly as possible and getting
back to London—S’Africa is much nearer to
London than Australia is—and while he is there
making the money, if he does make it, he often
contents himself with a colored “convenience.”
Thus not only does he neglect his Imperial duty,
but he damages the empire by making the whole
race contemptuous in the eyes of the strong,
virile, clean-living Afrikander. It was this
degrading practice that caused one decent old
dopper to introduce into the Volksraad a Bill for
the prevention of the marriage of Afrikander
Dutcn girls with Britishers ; and in the debate
which followed the white old fanatic spoke of the
Briton and the Chow as being on the same moral
plane.

THE EVICTION.-(A BY-AND-BYE PICTURE.)
"GEORGE TURNER, the Federal Treasurer, moved for leave to bring in a Bill to authorise the borrowing of money on the public credit of the Commonwealth. Mr. CROUGH (Vic.) entered a vigorous protest against the Commonwealth starting upon a career of borrowing.
'Already the States of Australia have borrowed £220,000,000, and the interest tax is orushing the productive industries-(hear, hear)-and the resourees of the Commonwealth will be taxed boyond bearing if we do not shut down on the borrowing idea. (Hear, hear.) I am glad to
have this opportunity of entering my protest.' MR. HIGGINS: 'I am in agreement with the honorable member.' (Hear, hear.) MR. O'MALLEY joined MR. CROUOH in his protest. He said every other country in the world was endeavoring to pay its debts except Australia. He
would divide the House dozens of times in order to blook any borrowing. Minister LYNE: 'How are you going to carry out defence works, buy rifles, &c., without borrowing?' MR. M'COLL (Vic.) joined the other speakers in protesting against the borrowing."-Daily paper.

The “ Allenburys” Foods provide nourishment suited to the growing digestive powers
of the Infant* and constitute an altogether distinct advance on the mischievous expedient of trying
to make the child’s stomach accomodate itself to a food essentially unsuited to its digestive powers.
Farinaceous foods of all kinds are totally unfit for infants under five or six months of age, such foods
being a potent cause of digestive troubles, rickets, and many disorders arising from mal-nutrition.
The “Allenburys” Foods are especially valuable in hot
climates. They are in the term of powder and keep perfectly.

DEAFNESS.
In addition to the inconvenience inherent in the
infirmity itself, DEAFNESS has a marked influence on
the Mental Development of the individual, when the
latter has been attacked bv it in youth.
Fora long time DEAFNESS and CHRONIC AFFEC-
TIONS OF THE EAR have been considered almost
incurable, but recently a very simple means has been
found in the ELECTRICON to successfully apply
METALLIC GALVANIC ELECTRICITY direct to the
Ears, PERMANENTLY CURING DEAFNESS, and com-
pletely banishing all distressing head noises.
Those who are interested in the suhject would do
well to read the complete description of this method of
treatment in the “ Journal for the Deaf,” published by the

Alleged that out of the last 200 Turkish

“ Galvo ” writes interestingly about deaf-
n<“ He that hath ears to hear let him hear, but he whose
ears cannot hear let him hear with his eyes, should be
the motto of the partly deaf. The totally deaf are hope-
less Writer has had 20 years’ experience, and would
like others more lucky to understand how very fortunate
thev are. Blindness is universally pitied, but the evils
of deafness are apt to be under-estimated. Deafness
means social ostracism, self-absorption warping of char-
acter, irritability, liability to misunderstand, and to
imagine slights. It also causes actual hallucinations, but,
per contra, it induces the study of voices, and of the
various qualities of articulate sound. Sibilant sounds, I
find are the most difficult to hear, explodents the easiest
-swear-words are mostly explodents. Voices, by the
wav are very deceptive. Some, which to normal hearing
are loud, are really lacking in penetrative power, while
others cannot make their words understood because of
their loudness, which seems to echo through the head. A
deaf man’s head feels like a cave, wherein his own and out-
side voices appear to reverberate. In this writer s case, his
own voice gives him the impression that he is shouting,
although to others it is scarcely audible. This is why the
deaf, as a rule, speak so softly and monotonously. A
curious peculiarity with many partly-deaf persons is the
ease with which very slight, or at other times quite in-
audible, sounds car. be heard amidst jarring noises, such
as that of machinery. Writer is an engineer, and can
hear a flea sneeze in a room full of clanking machinery
or in a fast-moving train, but with the cessation of such
noise he becomes as deaf as before. As to auditory hallu-
cinations, writer has heard voices, bells, engines throbbing,
doors slamming, water falling, and the sea beating on the
shore —when such sounds had no real existence. He
would be glad of some explanation of this phenomenon,
as also of the curious manner in which sounds will
occasionally “ lag,” so to put it. He has frequently been
asked a question, not heard a single word, and asked for
a repetition—and then, before this could be given, he
has distinctly heard and understood the original utter-
ance. Finally, the writer would repeat this advice to his
fellow sufferers to learn to hear with the eyes. With
practice, in closely observing the lips of speakers, one
acquires surprising skill in interpreting the motions,
which, with the aid of a word caught here and there, will
generally enable one to comprehend what is said. .He
would also appeal to the non-deaf to be more patient
with the “ hard of hearing” only that he knows by pain-_
ful experience it would be useless ; for deafness is to most
people a crime to be resented —not an infirmity to be
pitied.
When the late B. 0. Aspinall was a
candidate for the representation of I albot in Vio.
Leg. Assembly, he told the miners that if elected
he would see that each one of them had a pony to
ride on to and from his work. This caused a great
laugh, but the suggestion seems to have been
prophetic, because, according to an Englishman
who lately visited America, thousands of gigs
may be seen at 8 a.m. every day outside the great
workshops of that fine country for the laboring
man, the employees having driven to their work-
place in these vehicles.

but the practical need of the day is for a bill to

A number of the Senate revenue-tariffists
are much disgusted with Symon’s selfishness.
Whenever success is assured, he insists upon
moving the ‘ ‘ suggestion ” himself. Where there
is no limelight attached to the job, he hands it

David Syme, howling persistently for the
abolition of the Commonwealth and State Han-
sabds, may console himself with the reflection
that if he and his kind had been decently honest
in their condensation and reports of members’
speeches there might have been some hope of his
getting his way.
The Freetrade party in the Federal House

As to the Amending N.S.W. Old Age
Pension Bill, (wherein it is proposed to compel
the wage-earning relatives of old-age pensioners
to contribute towards their pensions.) Haynes,
M.L.A., pertinently asked in the Assembly if, in
the event of the amendment becoming law, the
Minister would make inquiries as to whether
Supreme Court Judges on the pension list have
any wealthy relatives who could contribute
towards their pensions. The idea that the old-
age pension is a charitable dole and not a pension
for oitizen services rendered must be stamped
out.

During the past 12 months the Victorian
railway department has paid .£20,500 in compen-
sation for accidents—about three times as much
as the record of the worst of the previous ten
years. The policy of filling up the service with
temporary ” men who haven’t passed the pre-
scribed examinations, but who are acquainted
with a politician, is beginning to tell.
Sydney D.T’s London correspondent wails
distressfully of the decline of Cobdenism in
England :
I don’t know whether the heart has gone out of the old
Freetrade cause in England, but the anti-corn law move-
ment certainly lacks vitality. . . . What should have
been a magnificent and nationally-exciting Freetrade
gathering at Manchester yesterday was of practicall\ r no
more importance and excited no more enthusiasm than
an ordinary popular political gathering.
“F. : I suggest as a loyal Coronation
sentiment. At no period of English history since
the days of Cromwell has the monarchy seemed
less absurd than to-day. The standard of royal
respectability has been advancing, until now it
reaches to the level of decency ; the national
character has been degenerating in sturdiness,
until it is now almost on the level which deserves
a monarchy.
The “ unemployed ” in Adelaide are 300 or
400 strong. The Trades-hall is in the very heart
of the city, a half-minute from the G.P.0., and
here they assemble in full view of Fatman. This
being a blob on the fair aspect of Adelaide, S.A.
is making a great effort to find the men relief by
private subscription and Govt. aid. With its
unemployed, its worse than empty Treasury, and
its Jenkins, S.A. is in a sorry state just now.
The clothing item in the tariff brought up
Senator Symon, as usual, to demand that the
duty should be lowered, his argument being that
the reduced impost would increase importation,
and socutdown local production and diminish local
employment and do other like things, all of which
Symon holds to be eminently desirable. The
child-like frankness with which Symon and co.
plead for reduced duties on the ground that they
will damage Australian industries is one of the
mental phenomena of politics.
Dr. Roth, protector of Q. Aborigines,
announced recently that he should strongly object
to any returning Kanaka taking his aboriginal
wife back to the islands. Brisbane Courier
wants to know indignantly if the Barton
Government meant to separate man and wife

etc., etc. The immorality and injustice of
tearing a Kanaka away from his Kanaka wife
and condemning him to a life of celibacy on
a Q. plantation has not yet struck the
Courier.
Sydney D.T. (June 14) ;
Women are only employed at a lower wage-rate than
men because they are willing to accept it. To legislate
against that fact as it stands alone, is to court legislative
defeat.
Is not that a negation of most Labor legislation
during the last decade, and of trades-unionism
during the last half-century? Put “a class of
men” instead of “women,” and the antique
economic stereo, becomes plain at once
P.M.G. Drake is commonly accused of
having no backbone. All the same, his action in
sticking out against the joint stand-and-deliver
demand of Queensland Premier Philp, the Q.N.
Bank, and Cobb and Co. deserves to be marked
up to his credit. That attempt to squeeze the
Commonwealth was the most audacious that has
yet come to light—always excepting, of course,
the demand of those Sydney papers for a free-
postage subsidy.
How the fear of Chamberlain is eating
into the hearts of A-Ustralian politicians ! A
N.S.W. Cabinet Minister having expressed his
agreement with the Irish Home Rule agitation,
Mr. Hawken, M.L.C., objected in the House,
whereupon the representative of the Cabinet :
When a Minister spoke at a public meeting on matters
of no concern to the Government, he himself, and not the
Government, should be held responsible for his utterances.
Mr. Hawken : “ I think it only right that Mr. Cham-
berlain should know.”
Sydney D.T.’s London correspondent,
after complaining viciously of the new British
duties on grain because they are liable to give
the British farmer some * Protection, scolds
vigorously because the Salisbury Govt, didn’t step
in with a big subsidy to protect the ship-owning
capitalists from the Morgan Trust. Your typical
Freetrader generally believes in helping capital
with bonus or tariff : it is only when the proposal
is to help the farmer and the laborer that a pro-
test is raised.
A bye-election for Claremont (W.A.)
brought out an Opposition candidate named
Wilson, who spoke severely about the Leake
Ministry for proposing to devote part of the ex-
pected £250,000 or £300,0000 surplus to railway-
building. He said that railways and similar
permanent works should be built out of loan money.
A time seems to be really coming in Australia
when a politician who is found building anything
except out of loans will be run-in. The crime of
not running sufficiently into debt is a serious
one in this country.

the strength of Tory lies that work would be found
during the present winter, and now it is announced
that “ when the plans are completed they will be
sent to England.” Snow is in London and it may
be a year ere a single rail is laid. Meantime, Sir
Bonython’s erstwhile democratic sheet is in-
dustriously boosting the Parsons-Newland-Brook-
man land-grant transcontinental railway scheme.
The very latest in Cornstalk politics is a
conference between the State Premier, the
nominal leader of the Opposition, and the leader
of the Labor Party to devise a new scheme to
solve the unemployed question. Every scheme up
to date has started with the creation of a new
tribunal, something to provide a billet for two or
three deserving-well-of-the-partyunemployed folk.
Something good, however, may come out of this
conference. At the least it is another staggering
blow at “party government.”
The “ honorary Minister ” game as played
in Victoria, and elsewhere, isn’t quite so honorary
—or honorable—as it looks. The billet carries a
free railway pass, worth .880 a year, and a director
of mining and other boards states, in Melb. press,
that he is always meeting cases of politicians
attending such meetings “on the never” yet
carefully collecting the railway-fare. Now, if a
landlord sends, say, a plumber to repair one of his
houses, paying his‘expenses as usual, and said
plumber demands his fare from the tenant also, he
would very suddenly find himself in a place where
the fare is mostly hominy and cold water.
Sydney D.T. gibes at the Labor party :
The Labor party stands now, and has stood for some
years, for lavish disbursement of both revenue and loan
funds. It supports a policy of expenditure which revenue
is quite inadequate to carrying out.
There is much truth in the accusation, and the
one party which holds out any hope of reform in
N.S.W. politics should take prompt steps to set
its house in order in this regard. A Financial
Reform Government must come into power within
the next few years ; it all depends on the Labor
members whether that Cabinet is made up of
Radicals or Conservatives.
The Methodist parson, who is a big force
in S.A., has had a lot to do with that province’s
backsliding from progressive politics. Ten years
or so back there was a big democratic revival in
Adelaide, and it had a largely religious basis.
Hugh Gilmore, one of the greatest men that ever
stood in an Australian pulpit, was a leader in it;
and there was a company of younger radicals
talking reform on platform and in pulpit. That
was why there were so many “local preachers ” in
the S.A. Parliamentary Labor Party. But
Gilmore died (he had only been a year or two in
the country), and the older Methodies frowned on
the progressive youngsters and packed them off to
Westralia, where most of them stayed.
There is just one flaw in the argument that
Victoria should collect income-tax from Common-
wealth servants within its borders, and the same
is a strong reason for the imposition of income and
other direct taxes by the Federal Parliament :
The Constitution Act, in giving Vic. the tem-
porary capital, didn’t intend it should thus be
enabled to advantage itself to a greater extent
than the other States. The officers’ work is done
for the whole Commonwealth, and their salaries
paid by it ; also the present incidence of the tax
is uniust —a postmaster or customs official in Vic.
or N.S.W. would pay, while his similarly-rated
and paid brother in Queensland or Westralia
would escape scot free.
It is probable that before Gov.-General
Hopetoun shakes Australian dust off his spats he
will hear a few more home-truths about- his vice-
regal career. H.E.’s desire to pose as a statesman
was bound to get him into trouble, and the onus
of the delinquencies of the Barton Govt, is now
being laid at his hitherto-worshipped feet. It
was Hopetoun’s unexpected call for Lyne to form
a Ministry in the first place that made it necessary
for that large and masterful individual to be
awarded a seat in Barton’s Cabinet ; and Lyne is
now the chief transgressor upon Treasurer Tur-
ner’s good-nature. Only for the interference of
the imported aspirant for a statesman’s laurels,
Long Bill would never have been given a show to
worry the life out of the guardian of the money-
bags.
Queensland has the worst record in Aus-
tralia for the systematic disfranchisement of its
population. The latest available figures are:
Queensland, only 19 per cent, of the population
are voters —this despite the fact that the man
with two or three votes is counted as two or three
separate voters. In Victoria 21 per cent, of the
population are voters; in N.S.W., Tas-
mania, and South Australia about 23 i per
cent. ; in Westralia, about 25 per cent.
This is not counting the female vote where
there is one, and it is taking no account
of the fact that in N.S.W. and S.A. every
voter is counted only once—with a plural
property vote these places might show 25
per cent. The Bulletin received a visit re-
cently from a Queensland politician of the
Philpite persuasion, who solemnly assured it
that his State had the largest proportion
of male voters to population in Aus-
tralia. It hopes his other statements
ware more accurate than this one.
One of the most noticeable results of the
late war has been the absolute deposition of the
Almighty God—so far as the current religious
literature of Britain is concerned—and the substi-
tution of a “ Providence ” in subservient alba m e
with Joe Chamberlain.
The Philp misgovernment, in the throes
of a virtuous retrenchment, proposes to economise
in future in the matter of free passes on Queens-
land State railways. All Government depart-
ments are to pay fares like ordinary persons hence-
forth, and if the Police Department, for instance,
says Minister Lealiy, wants to send a policeman
from one town to another it will have to pay that
policeman’s fare. All of which will no more
lessen the deficit than the taking of money from
one pocket and putting it in another will make
a man more wealthy, seeing that the Treasury
will have to pay the fare either way. What the
finances do want is the abolition of free railway
passes now granted to every wealthy, titled dead-
head who happens to visit the land for pleasure,
and the compulsory paying of their fares like
ordinary people by the wealthy relations of
persons in power.
The amazing statement comes from Queens-
land that the retrenching Philp Government pro-
poses to close Rockhampton Benevolent Asylum
m the interests of economy. There is apparently
no wickedness that the Philp Government won’t
perpetrate, and nobody it won’t oppress, to avoid
levying land and income taxes in order to make
ends meet. Queensland levies far less local taxa-
tion than most countries—about one-fourth the
English rate ; and it is almost the only civilised
country in the world which hasn’t a land-tax and
income-tax. In Britain, France, Germany,
Austria and Italy, the Government levies land-
tax, income-tax and house-tax, with heavy local
taxation as well. A deadly resolve not to pay the
inevitable cost of civilisation, a miserable whining-
about its poverty, and a oheerful readiness to
plunder anybody or borrow anything rather than
race its difficulties, are the troubles of the Philp
push.
FORBIDDING.
AUNTIE : “ Now, Elsie, am I not always for-

The Irvine-Shiels crowd only determined l
upon “selling” the men who helped them to-
chuck out Peacock at the very last moment. They
were going for the 65 and 33 reduction until the-
pathetic Irvine took fright at the result of the-
Footseray suburban election, when an alleged
reformer was returned by a few votes more than*
Labor man Lemmon. Yet the solid truth is that
the Footseray poll gave no indication whatever
that “reform” was in the air. Young Lemmon,,
who contested the seat previously, largely in-
creased his total of votes, and, as he favored an
Assembly of 69 members, it didn’t look much as
if Kyabram had spread its malign influence over
the smellful suburb. Also, Footseray was
erroneously called a Labor constituency by the-
lying dailies. Although it used to return John
Hancock, it has since put in three men uncom-
mitted to the Labor platform, and contumeliously
rejected the aggressive Prendergast.

RAILWAY FREIGHTS. i
DISSATISFACTION FELT.
Deloraine, Tuesday.—Great dissatisfaction is being-
freely expressed in re the new tariff of railway freights.

strongly at the State Reform League’s meeting, to be
held at Elizabeth Town on Thursday.

Reform League, consisting, chiefly of farmers,
resolves, with a loud yell, that “ Steps be taken ”

Melbourne Age is a good hater and an
unscrupulous enemy. It has a loathing of ex-
Railways Minister Trenwith which comes within
an ace of mania, and there is apparently nothing
he can do which isn’t one of the seven deadly sins.
In the latter days of the Peacock Ministry,
Trenwith seems to have verbally offered Fitz-
patrick, subject to Parliamentary sanction, the
Commissionership of Vic. Railways. After the
fall of the Peacock Cabinet, but before he left
office, Trenwith wrote a letter to Fitzpatrick in
which he stated that, at the latter’s request, he
put it on ''record that he had promised to ask
Parliament to appoint him as Commissioner, and
that Fitzpatrick had agreed to accept the position
if appointed. It was a perfectly fair thing to give
Fitzpatrick a written statement of the position,
but this act of common decency was magnified by
the Age into something like a definite appoint-
ment made by a Ministry after it had fallen, and!
the Age raged about the matter as if the heavens
had fallen as well as Peacock.

Dear Sir,—My son, who is now 14 years of age, has been
very ill off and on since he was four years, and about
three years ago he was so very weak and ill that the
doctor told me he was developing consumption. He had
a terrible cough, which was distressing to listen to; he
had fallen away to almost a skeleton. At this time Mr.
Luxon, Sydney Road, Coburg, advised me to try
VTTADATiO, which I did. After the first bottle I saw a
great improvement I continued the medicine, he
gradually improved until he became quite well. I con-
sider VITADATIO a wonderful medicine, as it has made a
different boy of my son, whom I never expected to see
healthy again. I can recommend it to anyone, and will
be glad to give any information to anyone suffering from
the same complaint.—l remain,

The odd combination of office-seekers who
helped Irvine to oust Smiler Peacock from the
Vic. Premiership (all except those in the swindle)
now kick themselves mightily for trusting various
politicians who have assiduously cultivated re-
putations for high and invulnerable principle.
Irvine, M'Kenzie, and the Scottish Cawmeron
were all three regarded as wedded to their
principles, and when they pledged themselves in
the party caucuses not to go for any reduction
below 70, their followers thought it absolutely
impossible for them to go back on their words.
Now the “ principle ” of Mr. Irvine and Mr.
MKenzie and Mr. Cawmeron is a burst bubble,
and that Maohiavellian trio finds itself on nearly
the same plane as champion trickster Outtrim in
the estimation of its betrayed supporters.

The Kyabram (Vic)., “reform party”
appears to have unanimously withdrawn the one
first-class item in its programne. Thus Premier
Irvine:
An important feature in the programme of the league
'was the prohibition of loans for non-productive works.
That staggered him until it was explained that it meant
loans only for works either directly or indirectly for the
benefit of the State. They would have to borrow for
many works not strictly reproductive, such as the supply
of water in arid districts or for building and repairing
State schools, which, though not directly reproductive,
yet were for the national benefit.
Any purpose for which money can be borrowed
may be set down as “ indirectly reproductive,”
even the repairing of old unpaid-for State schools.
The Kyabram league seems to have hastened to
explain that its intentions weren’t nearly so
honorable as they looked. Of course a school
isn’t reproductive, and its wearing-out shows that
it isn’t permanent, but the good old “permanent
and reproductive ” gag applies just the same.

Postmaster-General Drake promises to fall
heavily on some little-known varieties of the free-
postage swindle as soon as the passing of the
Postal Rates Bill gives him the necessary
authority. This, according to a Melbourne paper,
is how Drake found things in Victoria —he
hasn’t been round all the States yet :
Not the slightest check has been maintained by the
Ministers of the State or the heads of departments on the
use of the rubber stamps which frank letters free. On
arriving in Melbourne Mr. Drake found in his desk
envelopes ready for use with the rubber stamp marks of
all sorts of departments on them. He daily receives
letters franked as from the Chief Secretary, the Minister
of Defence and the Victorian Speaker, whereas their
contents have nothing whatever to do with the franking
officials and do not originate in their offices. Apparently,
anybody known to a Government department with a
rubber stamp has only to say, “ Oh, lend me your stamp
for half an hour,” and he gets the power to send gratis
as many private or public letters as he chooses.
Can’t Drake sool the police on to these swindlers
meanwhile —just by way of something to go on
with !
A few days ago London really had a
suspicion that King Edward was dying. It is so
rarely that a sovereign is acknowledged to be in
any but the best of health till he is at death’s door
that the admitted illness of a king is always
looked upon with suspicion. People who had
large sums invested in Coronation shows of one
kind and another paid as much as £2l per £lOO on
insurance policies payable if the Coronation fell
through.

riIHERE is no more Healthy, Comfortable, and Rational
T form of material for everybody during Winter, or for
continual wear for Delicate People and Invalids than
VERTEX CELLULAR WOOLLEN
which by its construction and relation to the human
body constitutes practically a supplementary skin,
affording the protection of natural warmth while per-
mitting the necessary free evaporation of moisture and
deleterious vapors continually being passed off by the
true skin ; the escape of which is prevented by most other
forms of Underclothing Fabrics by their density and
closeness of texture.

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-st., Melbourne, is the largest buyer of
Opals, Sapphires, Pearls and other Australian
gems, and consignors will find it to their advantage
to send their parcels direct to him. The firm has
a reputation for straight-dealing, extending over a
period of 40 years, which is a sufficient guarantee
that they will be honorably treated. A trial par-
cel, which will be followed by direct remittance,
is solicited.
A NEW PLAN OF SALE.
The Daily Mail of London has by a recent arrangement
concluded with The Times, obtained the right to offer the
“ Encyclopedia Britannica” (The Times’ reprint) not only
at the half-price, but on terms which require the sub-
scriber to pay only a trifling sum each month towards the
cost. This monthly payment is about one-half that
required in the case of subscribers who bought of The
Times direct, and it was permitted in order that the great
national reference work might be distributed among the
classes who were unable to make the large monthly pay-
ment, but who naturally desire to possess so valuable and
so useful a set of books. As a convenient and easy
method of acquiring a library of world knowledge, it
lea\ es nothing to be desired. Every effort has been made
to place the “ Encyclopaedia Britannica ” within reach of
the man who wishes to broaden himself by study, or to
supply the deficiencies of an imperfect education. The
present offer will continue but for a time. The distribu-
tors announce in our columns this week that they will
supply gratis, a Prospectus to the work giving sample
pages, and full particulars. Books are on view at
Nicholson and Go., George-street, Sydney.
Lines from Shelley’s dramatic fragment,
“ Charles the First,” on the passage of the Court
Masque through London:—
Aye, there they are—-
Nobles, and sons of nobles, patentees,
Monopolists, and stewards of this poor farm,
On whose lean sheep sit the prophetic crows.
Here is the pomp that strips the houseless orphan,
Here is the pride that breaks the desolate heart.
These are the lilies glorious as Solomon,
Who toil not, neither do they spin—unless
It be the webs they catch poor rogues withaL
Here is the surfeit, which to them who earn
The niggard wages of the earth, scarce leaves
The tithe that will support them till they crawl
Back to its cold, hard bosom. Here is health
Followed by grim disease, glory by shame,
Waste by lank famine, wealth by squalid want,
And England’s sin by England’s punishment.
The Bulletin Story Book (price ss.

interest and literary value, the selection is un- !
surpassed in this country.*
“Hyphen” : Was journeying a few!
months ago from Patagonia to Buenos Ayres, j
At Chuput an old Welshman and his family
joined the ship. His English was ragged and his
Spanish no better while his belongings spoke
Welsh only. He was en route for Wales and one
of the colonies, and we gathered that he was
leaving Argentina because the Government made
the teaching of Spanish compulsory in the schools, i
Welsh girls were marrying natives, and Welsh
colonists weie taxed to build R.C schools and
churches, floods had swept away the irrigation-
works and destroyed much of the land, and the
local Argentine official openly protected the cattle
and horse-thieves who raided the settlements.
The old chap thought he’d try either Canada or
Australia.

Juries and the Property Qualification.
Centuries of agricultural serfdom and touching
one's hat to the squire seem to have so ingrained
respect for the wisdom and worth of “ Proputty ”
into the average British skull that even in demo-
cratic offshoots of Britain the “proputty” criterion
of wisdom and worth lingers like the taint of an
hereditary disease. Not only is this criterion
used in regard to electors and members of legisla-
tive and municipal bodies in many Australian
States, in the great care bestowed by Courts in
safeguarding the interests of wealthy “infants”
by the “wardship” system, and in the loath-
some “ station -in - life ” test as applied to
damages in seduction cases, but the very
foundation-stone of most of our liberties, the
right of judgment “by one’s peers” in trial by
jury, has a fault in the shape of a property quali-
fication. The recent discussions on jury-reform
in Victoria have revealed the disgraceful fact that
a citizen cannot be a common juror unless he is a
householder rated on an annual value of £2O, and
that he cannot be a special juror (qualified to try
Supreme Court cases and County Court cases, in-
cluding actions against employers for injuries
through negligence) unless he is rated on an
annual value of £6O or possesses land worth £l2OO,
or which returns him an income of £6O a year.
Anyone who knows the average stupidity of
“Iproperty ” can hardly any longer wonder at the
numerous absurd verdicts and inexplicable dis-
agreements which are beginning to threaten the
very existence of the historically valuable and
still indispensable jury system. When we
remember that cases of breach of con-
tract by shearers or farm - laborers, or
actions for damages against trades-union officials
for “picketing ” in strikes, or actions and prosecu-
tions for trespass on lands, or any other of the
numerous cases where the rights of the land-own-
ing, or employing, classes come into conflict with
the “ rights ” of the landless, or employed, classes,
are in a great many cases determined by a body of
men drawn exclusively from those who own at
least £l2OO worth of land, or are in receipt of at
least £6O a year from land, we can appreciate the
subtle sarcasm which the defendant, or accused
shearer, farm-laborer, strike-secretary, or alleged
trespasser after game will see in the statement
that he will have fair play because he will be
“ judged by his peers. ” There have been effec-
tive election catchwords of less intrinsic worth
than this of “No Property Qualification for
Juries i ”

Between 1850 and 1900 the U.S. multiplied their
manufactures by six and their commerce and agri-
culture by three ; but the tonnage of U.S. vessels
.in the ocean trade fell from 2,496,894 to 837,229,
and a few years before it had been lower even
than that; deep-sea shipping is, in fact, the only
big American industry which has not advanced;
and it is a telling fact that it is also the only big
American industry which is run on Freetrade
lines. On land the American has been protected
from the cheap foreigner; and, thus getting a
start, he soon led the world in a hundred races.
On the open sea, on the other hand, the cheap
foreigner forced him either to come down to
his level of cheapness or clear out —and the
American preferred to clear out. But in the war
with Spain he found that it was not quite safe to
clear out and stay out; for he saw foreign ships
in the American trade sold to the enemy, to be
used by them in worrying him. He reckoned then
it was time to do something; and the Morgan
shipping combine is the something—simply a big
attempt to overcome, in a roundabout way, the
disadvantages of Freetrade and the evils that have
come from it.

“C.J.T.” culls these lessons from the war:—
Capture of big towns need not paralyse defensive
operations.
Organisation minus “goose-step” is preferable to
goose-step minus organisation.
Initiative is better than a college education.
Position-guns can be moved by bullock-drivers or
sailors, but not by a War-Office.
Reviews for public amusement should be discarded for
field-work —50 miles from road or rail.
Poor men who think the military profession an honor
to them are preferable to wealthy men who feel them-
selves an honor to the profession.
Give good pay, and no perquisites, extras, or servants.
A good -fighting man can be trained in one year, unless
the man or his officer is an utter ass.
Any officer lacking a working knowledge of the topo-
graphy of his own country should be sacked as being
devoid of intellect.
In time of war all requisites should be supplied locally
at ordinary rates. Any person making a profit out of his
country’s trouble should be hanged as a traitor.
If even a fifth-rate power were to attack Australia
within the next ten years we should have to give in at
once. Because : No small arms or ammunition factory ;
no leader capable of finding his way off road or rail; no
local war organisation except a casual politically-bossed
offshoot of the useless old dotard in England. Some
white men would refuse to help on the very reasonable
grounds that they not being employed during peace
time, the country should use Kanakas or Chinese in war-
time.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
J-C. committe o has brought to light a tabu-
lated list of distances of races run—exclusive of jumping
jumpers’flat and 2-year-old events-within theS
of IhPm w 6a dU ”, ng la , St year - The lot total 279 a »d 193
of them were a mile or less. Leaving Randwick out the
statement reveals that of 228 no less than 130 were under

contHWpH d Tu ards fche . s ® ei £ ht separate bodiel have
contnbuted. The committee now orders that at every
registered meeting within a 40 miles radius three races of

« the l 3ro F’ atn ™ “unless the list embraces not more
than five events and includes a hurdle and steeple : then
two such races must be put on." This is done to shut
down upon the practice of having so many struggles at six
furlongs or ess which induce bigger entries and thereby
£ed praters’ pockets more liberally than those at

prom°t ers are kicking' hard at the new order of things
but fortunately that fact doesn’t affect the A.J.O. much

if they get him to the post, will have 10.10 to carry in the

Calendar gives one no encouragement to back anything

Steeple. In 21 years the Hurdle has had 11 winners
handicapped below lOst. One carried lOst. exactly, and
another was list., but ne’er a one carried a middle-
weight. The Steeple has fallen four times in 21 years to

Tot® returns for the City Handicap, run on
first day of recent A.R.O. meeting, showed that the divs.
payable on seven starters ranged from 44 to 1 to 98 to 1,
after deducting the tote’s commission of 74 per cent.
The race in question didn’t happen to fall to one of these
outsiders, but the figures are none the less significant on
that account. Ikey Mo’s longest price on an ordinary
handicap book is 15 or 20 to 1, whilst the machine is open
r St'o „, ree ’ J our > an d five times as much on a turn-up.
In N.S.W. and Vic., where the tote is prohibited, the dif-
ference between fair prices and false prices is divided
among the ring men instead of going to comfort a few
lucky punters, and the Law only knows the reason why.
ihe fact that sharps get the cream of the market where
favorites are concerned, and leave the flats— i.e., holiday
punters to take the skim milk, is no argument in favor
of continuing a state of things which gives sharps an
advantage over flats. The Law surely doesn’t prohibit
totalisator betting in the interests of the best-informed
backers ! And it certainly isn’t acting in the ipterests of
Morality. Racecourse “ talent,” so called, is not
Public Morality any more than Ikey Mo is Sweetness and
Light.

Feature of Rosehill race-meeting, Saturday, was
Grand National Hurdle candidate Regalia’s easy appro-
priation of the big thing (June Handicap) of the day.
Getting away well, he kept in front and flashed up the
straight, winning easily six lengths to the good. Quality
of field, as Sydney suburban fields go, wasn’t at all bad.
Oute punters and Moes generally—having an eye to the
main chance always—set the wires clattering immediately
with urgently-worded instructions to Melbourne agents
to get on ” Regalia for the big jumping event to extents
more or less big, at once ; and prospects look promising,
too, for the nag is only asked to hump list. Regalia

G.N. Hurdles and ’Chase double (Holkarand
Sindhia), rushed before the weights saw light, had an
outing at Caulfield, Saturday, and didn’t, as far as the
second “ leg ” was concerned, give backers cause for much
joy. Holkar, red-hot at 6to 4, lined up with 16 others,
and, humping 81b. in excess of his G.N. allotment, got
away with Toolambool Hurdles nicely, but his stable
chum—Sindhia—though a warm first choice, went under
badly in Wanda Steeple, and during the finishing couple
of furlongs too; which suggests absence of bottom, and
consequent hopelessness of prospects. Still, she might
have needed a race or two to fix her ud.

Sydney’s big Mo. Oxy, no wen route for England,
couldn’t get a win with anything he owned for long
before leaving, but a week or so subsequently his Noble
Lady romped home in a six furlong race at Canterbury
Park, and was then sold. Her next act was to close on
Rosehill Parramatta Mile, Saturday, and more than clear
her purchase-money in a manner which indicated bigger
possibilities ahead.

A particular sporting interest attached to the
Two Thousand victory of Bob Sievier’s filly Sceptre
because he had offered her as a two-year-old to old John
Porter, the trainer oracle, who saw no great catch in her,
and preferred to pay £22,000 for a stable companion,
Duke of Westminster. This colt started at the same
price as Sceptre for the Two Thousand, but the race
clearly proved that John Porter last year had formed a
very wrong idea as to the relative prospects of the rival
youngsters.

Hast week, on Ascot (V.) track, champion trot-
ting stallion Emulator, by Osterley, with a flying start,
lowered his own mile record (2.23 2-sth) by getting over
the lourney In 2.20 4-sth, which now stands as the Aus-
tralian best. Four well-qualified people clocked the feat.
Emulator’s match with Lightfoot at the coming Austra-
lian Trotting Association’s meet should now fetch a big
“ gate.”
* * * *
Private letters from England tell that, even in
mid-May, the Australians were getting very poor gates.
Since then two Tests and several other matches have
been big frosts, and Ben Wardill, Darling, and co. must
be wondering whether the tour won’t be a complete
failure.

Hp to and inclusive of Derbyshire contest,
finished last week-end, Australians had gone under once
In 14 matches. Saunders is apparently all right now, but
against this the cable tells of an accident to Trumper
which rendered his leaving the field necessary. Further
Information regarding the invalided is to the effect that
Noble and Kelly have recovered, but are resting, and that
Jones is still a bit off color.

Australians haven’t much to plume themselves
on in recent triumph over South of England, which when
first picked was weak enough, but was made hopeless by
the defection of Llewellyn and Foster. Reason was that
of 16 first-class counties, 11 were simultaneously engaged,
ditto London County and both big ’Varsities. Abel and
Crawford came from Surrey, spared probably because of
soft job latter thought they had with Oxford. Analysed,
the 11 wasn’t a South of England team at all. Storerand
Bestwick (Derbyshire) are North of England—or, at any
rate, Midland players ; while Arnold and Wilson were
Worcestershire, which is certainly Midland. Last season,
of 24 matches played Derbyshire didn’t succeed in winning
one— l 3 being lost and 7 drawn. Last 11 from this side
beat it by an innings and 249 runs. Latest makes 10
matches between Australia and Derbyshire, of which 8
have gone to former, and 2 were drawn. Five were won
in a single innings, two by 8, and one by 6 wickets.

# Dear Bulletin. Does the Rugby game kill all
kicking in football? I was a spectator at the Glebe-
Newtown and Varsity-North Sydney matches, and in
each case the beaten side would have won easily had it
possessed a player who could kick decently for 30yds.
Some Sydney Rugby players can punt fairly well,'but
they can t drop-kick. A goal-kicker like Thurgood, of
Essendon (Vic.), would paralyse Sydney Rugby football.
V Oojqnbcgn seems to have been the last of the goal
drop-kickers (Blaney, the Uni. skipper, is only a weak
imitation), and he used to win match after match for the
Varsßy. Have seen in Melbourne a match won by 60 to
80yd. kicks. In Sydney it is 3to 1 against a man kicking
a from the 25yd. flag. A practised drop-kicker
ought to be as much valued as a good wicket-keeper in
cricket.—A.M.B.
• • • •
. F. C.. ’ football in Melbourne no sooner gains
in popularity than the old-time odour begins to arise. A
Uollingwood player was so strongly suspected of having
come to an arrangement” with a tote-man that he
went away West, in disgust, first leaving behind a
sworn declaration denying all charges. Then a boss goal-
kmker was tenderly suspended for three Saturdays for
striking opponents. Next—two players, from different
league clubs, were wiped out for the season for being too
open to conviction. One of these, also an expert
goal-kicker, was much too simple and ingenuous for
a Vic. footballer. He seems to have been seduced
from his own club by an offer of a “ stiddy job ” in the
Carlton Brewery, and promptly applied for a permit to
play for Carlton. Meanwhile, the goal-kicker’s former
club—Fitzroy—responded with an offer to stock and rent
a neat tobacconist’s shop. The simple youth thereupon
withdrew his application for a change of club, but had
n P osted , the letter when Carlton raised the screw of
the Brewery billet to something really handsome. Then
the much-sought player withdrew his withdrawal and
stood by his original application, but by this time every-
body knew all about it, and the permit committee became
virtuously indignant, and disqualified him for the year.
The junior clubs are just as strenuous ; having no cash
they make up for it in stoush. Tother day, a stolid coni
stable was hauled over the coals for failing to report what
seems to have been a very willing riot. This was an
alleged game "between the Hotham Hill Methodists and
the Fitzroy Baptists (in Met. Churches Ass.). It was short
but very sweet. Beginning at 3.40, by 4.20 the Baptists
retired discomfited. The ground of argument was the
Roygl Park, where good-sized gums abound ; these the
barrackers use as stands and hurl down sizeable twigs at
players they disapprove of. The fence enclosing it is—or
was—a paling fence ; it also came in handy. The con-
stable admitted there was considerable discussion—with
the palings—but reckoned it was all part of the game
Being a new man he got off with a caution.

Weather, bar wind, favored Saturday’s round of
Sydney’s first-grade Rugby, and matches, on the whole
were interesting. Results did not materially affect the
position of any club Western Suburbs beat South

7-3 ; Eastern Suburbs won a good game from Newtown,

Suburbs-South Sydney match Wickham, for former, kicked
no less than five goals-remarkable feat. Glebe, Western
Suburbs and Varsity are still bracketed top of the list
with 10 points each. ’

Charters Towers at one time took the palm for
brutality at football. T’other day Bundaberg took the
belt, for at a certain match casualities ran—shoulder dis-
located, ankle sprained, arm injured, man killed / Inci-

popular game with Queensland Kanakas.

revealed vast improvement. In good hands Barnes would

Neither Dillon nor Truscott got hurt at Sydney
Golden Gate A. 0., Saturday night, no sufficiently stiff
punches being available. Dillon, an old hand, but never
class enough to be called even a fourth-rater, jerked
about, sending in a pokey, left occasionally, or swinging
a stingless right when he thought the opening good*!
Truscott ducked all these easily enough, and then fairly
hurled himself in When things waxed extra warm,

bably, his great going-out act. Said that one of the

how he doesn t respond readily. On his last showing,
Scanlon hasn t a hope, and the rumors about him beino-
hocussed are simply absurd, as in the third and fourth
rounds he was quite himself, and for a time actually led
but, through inability to deliver weighty biffs, could
make nothing of his opportunities. In any future match
the Yank will certainly keep further away, but Mac will
get there just the same, and there’ll be no £230 gate and
no crowds from Sydney, and no nothing, but bashed

Old rivals Bob Turner and the young seaman Ed
Jessop dealt it out to each other at Sydney Gaiety A. o',
last week. It was all vim, and a tightly-wedged record
house for that particular resort swayed and cursed ex-
citedly. Round after round Jessep led, though not bv
much, and Turner stood it like an ironclad till the 14th
when Jessop began to fade. How he lasted at the Dace

the 20th —the limit. Here clever boxer “ Wally ” Weekps
(the referee) vowed that he couldn’t see that one was
better than the other, and ordered five rounds more
throughout four of which Turner showed much the
better; but Weekes declared a draw amidst a pande-
momum of hoots. Jessop certainly won in the first 20
rounds, but if the referee sized their respective scores up
as even then, Turner undoubtedly had the better of the
next five. Jessop injured his right hand badly some-
where near the middle of the struggle, and this may
account for his falling off. Weekes has probably hunted
Jessop out of the game for good, as when he and Turner
met before, Jessop led, but the verdict was a draw. Once
again it is shown that boxers themselves are the poorc t
judges of their own game.

Great Heart, winning dog of N.S.W. big Chal-
lenge Stakes, last week, is a 19 months old beauty in
shape and action. Fit, his poundage is 57f. Was the
only good one of Gipsy Queen’s litter by Lindsay Gordon.
Owner of the bitch gave Great Heart and another pup jr
to a coursing friend ; he, later, handed both over to a
third enthusiast, who in turn gave the pair to Green-
halge, the present owner of the now valuable champion.
Great Heart is unquestionably as good a one of his age
as this State has known ; he won the N.S. W. Derby this
season, and, in gathering his latest laurels, accounted for
most of the best from all corners of the continent. Only
previous N.S.W. Challenge Stakes (that of 1900) fell to
Braddon’s Blot, a puppy only 14 months old. Runner-up,
We Two, is a rare-shaped hound, and the cleverest of the
lot, without quite the speed of Great Heart or Braddon’s
Blot. We Two once belonged to old “ Sam ” Bladon, who
gave her to Mr. West, of Orange, as a wedding gift, hence
the name.

One-time crack Australian “ fedder,” Tim
Hegarty, was slugged out in ’Frisco on May 6 by ’Murkan
colored pug. Rufe Turner. For six rounds Hegarty did
the whirlwind act round the coon, but Turner survived,
and in the seventh 3min. got in a left hook on the mark
(solar plexus now) and a right cross on the point, which
sent the Australian to sleep for 15 winks. Tim has had
bad luck in Yankeedom. He broke a bone in his right
hand seven days before his fight with Tim Callahan was
due, and was thus blocked from collecting either the
winning or losing portion of a 1500dol. purse. Tim abso-
lutely owned the match with “ Kid” Lavigne but for a
fluke punch by the latter which brought hostilities to ah
abrupt termination. The first “go” with Spaniard
Herrera should have gone to Hegarty by a hatfiu of
points, instead of being declared a draw, and Tim demon-
strated the justice of this view by winning handily when
they got together again. Hegarty only trained eight
days for Britt, who came up fit to the moment. Further,
there was only one in it (and he Hegarty) throughout the
first five rounds, then the pace settled him.

N.S.W. National Coursing Association’s Chal-
lenge Stakes, at Rooty Hill, last week, was the most
successful for years. Sport extended over three full days
and proved flawless. Hounds (numbering 128) and “ fur”
were in top form, so much so that, right through, only 22
hares failed to find sanctuary, and, in 117 trials, but 14
of them were overhauled. Victorian crack, The Hermit,
was best favorite at first night’s card-call, but next day
his party drew him, on the grounds of “going” being
too hard and severe influenza. There was no mention made
of any financial reasons. One other happening marred
the gathering muchly. Rooty Hill veteran courser, Sam
Bladon had two in—Braddon’s Blot and Buffalo Bill,
latter nominated in another name. Concluding stages
brought them together, and owner insisted upon drawing
Buffalo Bill. Committee was divided as to whether it
should be allowed, but eventually gave way in face of
fact that rules were indisputably against the action.
Remonstrated with by backers whose money had been
lostwithoutarun.it was explained that though doing
their utmost to safeguard bets the committee acknow-
ledged no official cognisance of them. There’s something
decidedly novel in this sort of safeguarding. However
Braddon’s Blot had a gruelling bye with a kennel mate,
Booty, and was badly beaten in the next round, whereat
the crowd cheered uproariously.

Champion field-dog trial in the grounds of
Melbourne Exhibition, t’other day, was novel and in-
teresting. Twenty-six, mostly setters and pointers, com-
peted. Tussocks and other quail-cover dotted the ground,
and a score of birds were liberated. Tests occupied two
days; some excellent work was shown. Final brought
the pointer bitch Altona Juno and dog Bland together.
Juno ranged beautifully, and found and set her game in
rare style ; hardly giving Bland a chance, she won by a
wide margin. Altona Juno is typical of her breed in con-
formation, and a daughter of Plum, ex-Wanga Lady.

Match between pigeon-slayer A. W. Eales
and the champion butcher, “ Locksley,” at Botany, last
week, resulted in much carnage. Of 200 birds shot at, 182
were scored, and the balance, beyond one or two, toppled
over the boundary. Eales grassed 93 to “ Locksley’s ” 89.
They were together at 25 birds—2l each. At 50 birds,
the call was—Eales 46, “ Locksley 45, and at 75, Eales had
bagged 70 to t’others 65. Eales’ best runs were 33 (twice)
and 16; “ Locksley’s,” 9, 15, 13, 14. Birds were favored
by a strong westerly gale. Conditions called for 100 birds
each, and money staked was £5O aside. Less than two
years ago, Eales, in a match with the Victorian top-
notcher “ Bobby,” established a record by killing 99 in
100. In a trial, while preparing for this match, “ Locks-
ley ” is said to have brought 95 of 100 down.

A marvellous cycling record was accomplished
in Paris, May 4. Four of the world’s best pace-followers
—Elkes (America). Robl (Germany), Bonhours (France),
and Linton (Wales)—met. Linton is a veteran
at the game, and was only asked to race at the
last moment; betting ruled 25 to 1 against him
The Welshman jumped away best and stayed there,
despite heavy straining by the other three. Half-way
Linton’s tyre punctured, and Robl led him at 60 kilo-
metres, but Linton, with a superhuman effort, came
again, and ultimately won (f-m. ahead of the next man,
Elkes), covering 42m. 900yds. in the hour. Two weeks
before Robl had got over 41m. 1514yds. in the same
period, and was consequently much fancied.

Full particulars of the Dunlop road-race from
Goulburn to Sydney are now to hand, and the prize-list
is a very substantial one. As a matter of fact, its value
far exceeds that of the prize-list attached to any road-race
ever held in N.S. Wales, and is second only in Australasia
to the Warrnambool-Melbourne road race. The division
of the prizes seems to be equitable, giving all classes of
riders a fair chance, whilst two special medals are offered
to country riders under certain conditions. The date of
the race has been fixed for 9th August, and should attract
a very large entry, as most complete arrangements will
be made for the conduct of the race.

The Sydney Fodder Fiasco.
That “great mass meeting” in Sydney Town
Hall, which was to strike terror into the heart of
t ie Federal Cabinet, and cause it to fall over
itself in its haste to avert revolution by removing
the fodder duties, was an awful fiasco. There
were only about 600 people present. A few human
figures dotted over the two side galleries, but the
back gallery was absolutely empty, and down in
the body of the hall a vast wilderness of empty
chairs gaped derisively at the gang of importers,
Freetraders, and the tail of the anti-Federal
party that glowered on the platform. That
dreary waste of empty benches got on
Holman’s nerves, and he wailed plaintively
thereat. His moan about the “ beggarly
array of empty benches” was judiciously sup-
pressed by the Telegraph. It was W. M.
Hughes, M.H.R., who moved the first resolution.
Hughes has been keeping some very bad company
of late. He worked himself up into a fine frenzy,
and blithered eloquently over the callous inhu-
manity of the Federal Government, and declared
that the people of Australia generally were only
too anxious to have the duties removed. How he
knew lie didn’t explain. Holman then arose to
second the motion. He said N.S.W. was threat-
ened with famine. (Cheers.) Ruin stared all of
us in the face. (Wild applause.) Unless the
duties were removed' the whole of the stock
and sheep would die. (Tumultuous applause
and j T ells of “Traitor!”) Then he went
on to draw a harrowing and terrifying
picture of the 25,000 shearers of N.S.W. (one to
every 1500 sheep—earnings consequently £ls a
year each) trooping into the city and demanding
food, or blood, or work when all the sheep were
dead and there was no work for them up-country.
And the audience cheered wildly as though it
enjoyed the prospect. He wound up by declaring
that in the past N.S.W. had made tremendous
sacrifices in the cause of Federation and national
unity and it was the turn of the other States (the
States he and his kidney used to call “Lame
Ducks”) to come to the assistance of N.S.W. by
foregoing the fodder duties. As to what were
the great sacrifices N.S.W. made in the interfests
of Federation he maintained a dignified silence,
and no one got a chance to attempt to identify
them. Neither did he state how he knew there
were 25,000 shearers in N.S.W. The shearer is
hard to identify ; much of him consists of a small
cockie who goes out in the season and makes a few
extra pounds by taking the wool off the squatter’s
flock, but Holman carefully conveyed the
impression that there were 25,000 men who
lived by shearing alone, and that they
were a menace to the State unless the
duties were removed. John Norton, a bandage
on his head still showing, in reply to a question as
to what was the amount of the duty, said he Was
damned if he knew. Then he said a gentlemaiibn
the platform informed him it was £1 per ton on
lucerne, and that lucerne was now selling at£Bper
ton. In reply to another question hesaid a gentle-
man on the platform had been offered unlimited
quantities of lucerne from Argentina, at £3 10s.
per ton landed in Sydney (not including the duty).
Then he went off at a tangent and would not be
brought back to explain why the philanthropic
gentleman on the platform didn't wade in and
import “unlimited quantities” from Argentina
at £3 10s. a ton, and pay the £1 duty, and realise
£3 10s. a ton profit by selling at £8 a ton. Some
Sydney commercial men are very slow. A man
in the audience handed up an amendment to.the
effect that as it was desirable to save waste of
time, and consequent destruction of stock while
wrangling with the other States about the suspen-
sion of the duties, the State Government of
N.S.W. should solve the problem by paying the
duties on all imported fodder, seeing that it could
pay the Federal Government the amount by a
cheque, and it would receive its cheque back at
the end of the month as part of the surplus re-
turned under the Braddon Blot; and, secondly,
that it was beneath the dignity of the wealthy
“ Mother State ” to go begging assistance from
the Lame Ducks when it could solve the problem
much more quickly and without any cost to any-
one by the aforementioned method. But the
gang of patriots on the platform who wanted to
save the poor pastoralist, and prevent revolution
and bloodshed and all the horrors of famine and
civil war, weren’t taking any. Mayor Hughes
said the meeting would not be in order m discussing
the amendment. The speakers refused to answer
any questions till the demand for a reply stopped
the proceedings, and then one of them said he had
no objection to the State Government paying the
duties, but water conservation in the West was
the State Government’s first duty. He absolutely
declined to listen to any suggestion that it was,
according to the previous speakers, first neccessary
to feed the remnants of the stock while the water
was being conserved. One black-coated person
calmly advocated that the Federal Govt, should
suspend the duties even if a majority of the States
were against it, and said, as there was no Federal
High Court, no one could dispute the legality of
the action. Asked if a majority of the Senate
was in favor of the suspension of the duties, he
said a majority of the Senate was in favor of the
abolition of all duties, and, when further asked
why they didn’t move a resolution in the. Federal
Parliament, he said he didn’t know, and also that
he thought it would do no good. Several other
people gibbered at the disappearing audience, but
it was a sorrowful fiasco. The Bulletin is sorry
to find Holman and Hughes lending their coun-
tenances to a gang of persons who can only carry
their point by smothering free discussion and
ruling all amendments out of order.
The capture of the Kenniffs, who were
taken without damaging a single policeman, seems
to suggest that bushranging is a lost art. But,
after all, the Kenniffs can hardly be called bush-
rangers, except in the sense that they ranged
through the bush.. The most violent deed they
are charged with since they took to the scrub and
the hills is going into Mitchell on a Saturday
night to collect their back debts.

1 Father Rouillac, the R. 0. nigger-missioner,
was displeased when Sydney Marine Board in-
sisted on him taking a qualified captain in his
schooner Eclipse on her departure for the Islands.
TTia barrackers raged indignantly. But he had
lives on board, and the luck that brought him to
Sydney Heads without expert seamanship could
not be trusted. Father Rouillac thought he did a
clever thing in sending back the Marine Board’s
captain as soon as he got clear of authority. Now
the Eclipse is high and dry on the rocks.
“ Chasselas ” to The Bulletin :
Re “Arthur Glint” v. “Glenara" (8., 14/6/’O2). The
latter was right in his facts. Green Yale, one of the
boomed estates, was first offered to Govt, at 60s. per acre.
A portion was then sold at £3 per acre—since re-sold for
£s—and township allotments at over £lOO per acre.
Moffatt’s Lake Bolac estate, in the market at the same
time, was also offered to Govt., and afterwards sold to
one of Tyson’s heirs at £2 12s. 6d. per acre, as were also
Blythevale and Menenia to other buyers at the same
figure. These estates are all suitable for wheat growing,
and capable of absorbing the whole exodus from the
Mallee. The member for Ararat and some local demo-
crats brought the matter before the Lands Minister, but
red tape and Jingo-frenzy, and the unwillingness of Govt
to spend money on a paying investment, let slip the
opportunity of giving a deserving class the chance “ to
make a happy home.” “ Arthur Glint’s ” defence of
Peacock and co., on the ground that they are not as bad
as Irvine and co., is beside the question, and doesn’t say
much for Peacock and co., anyhow.

The most charitable conclusion to come to in regard
to Victorian Judge Hodge’s sentence of five years
and 40 lashes on W. W. Baker for assaulting a
man is that his Honor doesn’t understand the
brutality of inflicting this unspeakably horrible
torture of 40 lashes. It is probable that he
has never seen a flogging, even of 20 lashes,
which has for long been a practical maximum in
such civilised countries as still stain their
penal system with this relic of barbarism.
But, even accepting a plea of judicial
ignorance in extenuation of the savagery of
the flogging sentence, it is difficult to understand
how the Judge worked himself up to such a pitch
of indignation over the case. Baker s offence
was this, that during a peace-celebration at
Bendigo, a night of hysteria and drunkenness —
of Mafficking, in short—he assaulted a commercial
traveller, and in a rough-and-tumble scramble
bit his nose. The reasonable presumption—in
view of the circumstances (the men were at
grips on the ground, and the blood was hot with
Mafficking) and of the character of Baker—
was that the injury was not intentional. How-
ever that may be, to flog Baker with 40 lashes
would be to inflict a greater brutality than the
most unkind view of his disgusting offence can
convict him of. It is high time that flogging
scandals were done away with altogether by a
revision of the penal statutes. I logging has
always been a “class” punishment—a special
horror reserved for the man in moleskins. No
broadcloth coat or belltopper hat has ever
been hung up beside a British triangles,
no fine old scented lady felt her fair
white skin shudder at the thought of the
raspberry-marks on her son’s back. Un-
speakably vile and filthy brutes of “ respectable
family ” have at different times been exposed in
the law-courts, but their hides have never been
bared to the lash. Experience, too, has shown
that flogging is ineffiacious as a deterrent. In the
British Navy good conduct has developed, pro-
portionately, as the lash has been abandoned.
When flogging was general the ships were hells,
and the frequent method of recruiting men was by
a process analogous to that of the African slave-
raider. Now, when flogging has been practically
abolished, mutiny is unknown and misconduct
rare. The only reason for flogging continuing to
exist is that it gratifies the brutishness of the rich
and arrogant at the expense of the “lower orders.”
Victoria’s new Premier, Irvine, and Trea-
surer Shiels are both Irishmen. Former was
born in Newry, in ’58, educated at Armagh and
Trinity College, Dublin, and is B.A. of Dublin
and M. A. and LL.B. of Melb. Has been eight
years in the House, was Attorney-General in the
M‘Lean Ministry, and is a foreign-trader, pseudo-
Single-taxer, and fine, old, crusted Tory.. The
dilettante Shiels, who would rather write an
epigram than show a surplus, is also LL.13. of

ominous that every Ministry that has included
Bent has come to a disastrous end..

In the Easter peace negotiations Ketchener
stipulated that he would not meet De Wet. The
objection was said to be based on the allegation
that De Wet had court-martialled and ratified the
execution of a peace envoy, as a traitor. The
envoy’s offence was that he, a burgher of the
Orange Free State, while war was in operation,
entered the Boer lines and tried to induce the men
to lay down their arms. Wonder how Ketchener
would have dealt with, say, W. T. Stead, had
that aggressive person scrambled into the British
lines and argued the point with Tommy Atkins
about throwing down his arms ? The Boer le; ders
declined to confer without De Wet, and De Wet
duly attended.
A strange and squalid Maoriland episode
came to a close, a few days ago, when it was
decided that widow Sinnott, of Dunedin, was not
murdered, and that the fork found in her heart
arose through well-meaning people allowing her
dead body to roll down an embankment. The
story went that two men had been in widow Sin-
nott’s wooden hovel the night before her death,
the three indulging in drink and rows. The
hovel burned down that same night, and when
what was left of the charred body of the occupant
was examined, the prong of a carving-fork was
found imbedded in the heart. The Crown had a
theory that in the course of the previous evening’s
debate the woman was stabbed, the house being
afterwards burned to conceal the crime, and it
tried the loudest of the two visitors for his life.
The defence, however, produced some curious
evidence. It seems that friendly and well-
meaning people, filled with good intentions,
had rushed the burnt or burning premises,
and cast out various things and the corpse to
save them from further damage. They tried to
haul the corpse up an embankment with a rake,
but it slipped and slid down into the ditch. Later
on they got a fresh grip on it with the rake, and
this time the desecrated ember was really drawn
up. But when the body escaped from the well-
meaning people at the first attempt it fell on
certain goods and chattels in the ditch, and it is
supposed that it was then it became impaled on
the fork. There was no direct evidence against
accused, so on the strength of the gruesome
narrative he was acquitted. The tale is of value
principally as showing what excited Maorilanders,
who have lost their heads and found somebody
else’s body, are capable of.

A Delicious Parallel.
A revised version of the creed of the late Bill
Sikes has been unearthed by an English paper.
He suggests that the late Charles Dickens saw
only the worst side of one of his most noted
characters. Erom the subjoined it will be seen
that Sikes was in agreement with Cecil Rhodes
that there is a 50 per cent, chance of the existence
of a God who would, if he exists, be pretty certain
to agree with him on main questions. Though
Rhodes thought “in continents” and Sikes only
‘ m villas,” there are other notable similarities in
their ideas. Sikes, like Rhodes, “was not as
other men are, and cannot be judged by their
standards,” but he was fated to be born into a less
sympathetic world, and act only as a sort of John
the Baptist to the Imperial Messiah. As a conse-
qu?»ce lis °PP° rtun ities of “painting the world
red were more limited, and his benefactions to
the human race not so generally appreciated in his
own lifetime. Notwithstanding this the following
should be of interest just now :
« w D °t j b fJ iev : e there’s a Gawd?” exclaimed Sikks.
No I dont; I never seed ’im—did you? On’y one
mght when I was a-layin’ in a srubbery out ’Ornsey wav
waitin for em to put out the lights, somethink come over
me like. It was a dark night—for, in course, there wern’t
no moon—and it was that clear you could see all the
bloomin stars a-twinklin’. An’ I says to myself, I says,
says 1, Oo made them stars, Bill* —that was me ‘*Oo
made eni if it wasn’t Gawd ? ’ But then I says, ‘lt
there s a Gawd, I says, ‘ why does ’e let the beaks an’ the
perlice worrit a pore man,’ I says, ‘'oo wants to make a
bit of a livin ? So I carn’t make it out, I carn’t: I think
its about a heven charnst, I do. ’Ell! No, I don’t
believe there am t no such a thing as’Ell. Why, it stands
to reason, guv’nor, Gawd wouldn’t punish a pore man for
never an hever ’cos he’d gone a bit wrong in this ’ere
bloomni world Not as I’ve gone very far wrong myself,
hih . Oh, yes; that Ornsey job I was a-tellin' you of when
I copped the two ’undred shiners. Well, I call to mind a
tex what I eard at the Sunday-school, what says that when
a stronger man comes along, he takes the other bloke’s
goods. I aint a scholard, but I knows that mus’ be right
cos it s in the Bible. I didn’t go for to knock ’im on the
ead ; why didn t e give me the shiners when ’e see I was
stronger than im ? You wouldn’t blame a lion for eatin’
? ?° a . t L thel J . wh - y sh °uld you go about to blame me for
takin the shiners from a hold bloke what didn’t make
use of em? An’l’m a bloomin’ Dutchman, what don’t
count, as you may say. An’ why did ’e call the perlice ?
It am t fair ; let’s fight it out fair an’ square, man for man.
an no bloomin’perlice. That’s what I says. No, guv’nor
don’t you be afeared ; there ain’t no such a thing as ’ell.’
Don t you believe none of that ’ere gammon."
Notice this difference, however—it was Cecil
Rhodes and not “the other bloke” who called in
the police. Which goes to show that Sikes’
policy has been improved upon by his great suc-
cessor.

just now, Seddon) chooses to forbid, unless he is able to
maintain himself for three months. Nobody knew that
Govt, possessed such power until Seddon put his feet
down when a few Dalmatians (and very decent men at
that) attempted to land at Auckland three years ago.
Under the Kauri Gum Industry Act (1898) no foreigner
may dig for gum unless he pays 15s. for a miner’s license,
whereas a British subject pays only 55.; and under the
Alien Restriction Act- (1899) no foreigner may land in
Maoriland unless he is able to write something in some
European tongue. If a foreign seaman deserts, the
captain of his vessel must deposit £lOO with
the Customs authorities, which he forfeits, plus
the cost of searching for the fugitive if
the chase is unsuccessful. The atrocious gum legislation
was rushed through both Houses at the end of a session
when, of course, members were indisposed to indulge in
much fight, and it was the outcome of a campaign of lies
as wicked as that which has led up to the struggle in
« i.i C ?!‘ n , “flotation was got up on the northern gum-
nelds, headed by country storekeepers and a few pro-
prietors of those “ lambing-down ” groggeries called by
courtesy hotels. The Auckland papers sedulously fanned
the flames of race-hatred, and, among other things we
were told that the Austrians were “ too exclusive,” and
that their real object was to make as much money as
possible and return to their country. Patriot Seddon
went one better, and assured a servile House that the
Austrians were a “ danger to the State,” because they
practised drilling on Sundays, and would aid any invader
who came along. Now, as a matter of fact, I know
these Austrians to be very decent men. Certainly when
they first landed, their intention might have been to return
to Austria, but the great majority soon recovered from
home-sickness and have become useful settlers; in fact,
they can teach the Britisher how to cultivate the hungry
Kauri lands of the North. The real truth is that the
g r °gg e ry keepers dislike them because, unlike the
generality of gum-seekers, the Austrians are exceedingly
temperate. They are, in fact, most desirable colonists.
1° their credit be it said, they resent very strongly the
dastardly penalties imposed on them. But they have
not attempted to imitate the tactics of Raider Rhodes
v j h i B poor cats Paw, Jameson. They simply ap-
plied for naturalisation papers to enable them to
vote at the last election, but the issue of the papers
was carefuHy delayed till too late. Now, after
all this, doesn’t it seem more like rank hypocrisy
for us to cant about the Outlanders in the Transvaal ?
Bishops have given their benediction to the S’African
horror; but they are scrupulously silent when we our-
selves outrage the first principles of human liberty. I
don t object to our £lOO poll-tax on Chows and Japanese
—those devoted friends of the dear old Motherland—par-
don the Seddoman phrase. But fancy such scurvy
treatment of fellow white men, and by people who glorify
and participate in the shooting of Boers for refusing the
franchise to a motley horde of gold-seeking adventurers
who made that second Sodom, Jewhannesburg.
♦
The last of the Transvaal veterans who surren-
dered were clad in skins, with boots made from
old portmanteaux, and hats constructed out of
tripe. The thoroughly gory, unreasoning Jingo
ha j been demanding the execution of these war-
worn heroes on the ground that, not being in uni-
form, they couldn’t claim the ordinary privileges
of combatants. Tike the Beggars of the Sea who
fought against Spain, and the men who followed
Simon Bolivar or Benito Juarez, and the
Tyrolese patriots under Hofer, and the men
who were led by Garibaldi, and Wellington’s
Portuguese army in the Peninsula, their love for
their country had outlived their ability to pur-
chase a ridiculous cocked monstrosity with a
fowl’s tail in it. It is held by true Jingoes that
no man has a right to love or defend his
country unless he can buy a red coat, and some-
thing that looks like a demented ostrich to put
on his head. And yet these men with the
.portmanteau boots and cow’s-paunch hats will go
down to history along with many more equally
ill-clothed. If Palafox had surrendered Sara-
gossa as soon as his beautiful military togs gave
out, or Washington had retired in disorder when
he couldn’t buy any more nice clothes for his men,
a lot of thrilling literature would never have been
written. The fate of nations has been decided over
and over again by shoeless armies which had barely
enough cow-hide clothes left to preserve their
decency, and which had to fight at night because
they couldn’t be seen out in broad day for fear of
shocking all parties concerned. And despite all
theories, the world will probably go on respecting
the patriot whose devotion survived his best suit
of clothes, much more than it does the denunci-
atory and correctly-clothed Jingo solicitor who
stayed at home and took commission from the
opposite party’s solicitor. The world is a curious
beast, all things considered
✓
At Poverty Point.
At St. George’s Hall, London, the other week, an
anonymous co. of actors, prof, and amateur, gave an
interesting performance of an ancient Morality Play,
entitled “ Everyman." The popular notion that John
Bunyan was an inspired tinker is founded on popular
ignorance of the old Morality dramas. “ Everyman,”
which is one of the newest of them, was written and
acted before Bunyan was born, and it might have been
the model for “ Pilgrim’s Progress.” The name-character.
Everyman, is a representative citizen of religious tendcn-
S',' 03 -, ' Vlfch numerous friends—Fellowship, Knowledge.
Worldly Goods, Discretion, Good Deeds, dec. When
Death calls for the hero, who has enjoyed a good time, to
take him on his long journey, he sends for Worldly
Goods, Beauty, Strength, and the rest of them, to bear
!?uu company, but all, with the exception of Good
Deeds (a young man) decline the contract. God is
introduced into one scene of the play, where He sits
on a cloudy throne and delivers an address of love and
pity for mortal man. In the hands of a dignified elocu-
tionist even this dangerous character is said to be accept-
ab 650 st-rangdy impressive is the work. At the finish
ot the St. George’s Hall performance, when Everyman,
repentant and purified, descended into his grave saying:
Father, into Th.v hands I commend my spirit”—the
house wept beautifully. It might be worth a big manager’s
while to import this morality play, with its London
stage-manager, and run it through Australia. Whafc
opportunity for newspaper controversies, church theatre-
parties, Sunday-school matinees, and Sanctified Boodle 1
When Sarah Bernhardt was touring Australia, manager
Abbey sent an advance-agent to Adelaide to arrange for
her appearance there. Talking to Wybert Reeve, lessee
or the local theatre, the agent asked, “Now, where are
we going to put her up ? Remember, the best hotel in
the place is hardly good enough for Sarah.” “ Well,” said
Wybert,, tbe best hotel is the York ; but, unfortunately,
.. ® landlord won’t have a ‘ professional ’ in his house."
Good heavens 1 ” said the other, “ she mustn’t find that
out., You don’t know Sarah. Why, if she gets her back
up, he continued, not noticing that W.R. wore an
unmistakable “jazy,” “she’ll storm every hair off your
head. Reeve coughed, but said nothing. The difficulty
hy .engaging private apartments, and
kidding the Divine One that there was not a suitable
hotel m the place.
“There was an election pending at the time,” said the
Melb. Poverty Pointer, after he had dipped his nose
agam, and we were in a hole in Gippsland, trying to
make bread and gum. We put up a sort of hand-made
drama. As the villain, I was called upon to utter much
bad speech, and in the second act, after I had declaimed
some fine, fierce abuse of virtue, an aged agriculturist in
the stalls arose, shook a wrinkled forefinger at me, and
piped indignantly: ‘ I tell yer what, young feller if

Amongst the attractions of a small circus that once
struck a little Vic. town was a boxing lady who contracted
to take on any woman in the country, regardless of size
or weight and the smartest lad under 9st. that the
district could produce. On opening night a boy with a
smattering of science turned up, and the lady pug. did as
she liked with him for five rounds. The female puncher
was a nuggety young thing of about 26, bright-eyed and
nice-looking, and particularly neat with her natural pro-
tectors. When she had polished off the local champion,
and was about to retire amidst thunders of applause,
a fair-hawed, shambling woman climbed down from the
shilhng, seats, and threw her bonnet into the arena.

very reluctantly, the lady boxer pulled on her gloves

mits, and squared up. Her quality was made evident
from the jump. She fought with the dexterity and art
of a man, and had the professional down twice in the first

Shakespearean plays, as presented in our time is the
manner in which popular quotations are rendered
there are certain set speeches in each of William’s nlavs

“DAILY MAIL” OFFER
THE
SOMETH ING over a year ago The Times offered its Reprint of the Ninth Edition of the
ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNIC A to residents of Australia and New Zealand at prices
and upon terms which had previously prevailed during the sale of the work m Great Detain
and the other colonies. The offer was a pronounced success, and the sets reserved for
distribution in Australasia were rapidly subscribed for. The number of sets allotted for this purp
having been limited, many persons who delayed until it was too late were disappoin e in no £>
able to secure the work. Hundreds of applications were received after the offer was closed, and these
were of necessity refused. Many requests have since been received from those still desiring to possess
the work, and in order to accommodate these and a larger public, the Daily Mail ( on, . P .
succeeded in making an arrangement with The Times whereby a second distribution of this great
work of reference will be made under its auspices for a short period in the several states composing
the Commonwealth of Australia.
As in the past, this new offer will be limited, both as to the number of sets available and the time
in which the offer may be accepted. Those, therefore, who hesitate for a second time will not only
lose the opportunity which now presents itself for the last time, but will probably be una ) e
the work at all, unless it be at the prices originally established by the publishers, Messrs. A. and E.
Black—viz., £35, £45, and £65 respectively, according to style of binding.
The publication of The Times Reprint of the ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA, the nin
and latest edition,; brought this great national work of reference within the reach of a great number
of persons, for The Times reduced the price of the work to about one-half of the regular P r | c . e >
further facilitated its sale by initiating a system of monthly payments, m accordance wi i wuc
25 volumes were supplied upon the receipt of a preliminary payment of one I ® P u
greatly appreciated this opportunity that more than 30,000 copies of the ENOYCLUr
BRITANNICA have already been sold by The Times.
FIVE SHILLINGS FIRST PAYMENT.
BUT the proprietors of The Daily Mail believe that this plan of sale could be so extended as
to appeal to a still larger class—to the people to whom one guinea seems somewhat too large
a monthly payment. The negotiations undertaken with this object in view resulted m the
present offer. But the number of copies which The Daily Mail is thus enabled to supply is
limited, and the time during which its privileges are operative is likewise limited.
Under The Daily Mail offer those desiring the work may secure the complete 25 volumes in any
of the four styles of binding upon a preliminary payment of ss. Subsequent payments may then be
made by the purchaser at the rate of 12s. per month —less than 6d. per day. The subscriber pays
this-less-than-half-pnce and on these easy terms while he is m the possession of the work. Such a
statement seems almost too good to be true ; yet it is true, absolutely. . ,
Of recent years great strides have been made m the production of good and cheap literature, but
with all the advance that has been made in placing good literature within the reach of a man with a
moderate income, there still remained many works, which owing to their length and the costliness ot
Droduction, could not be produced at a price which people of moderate means could afiord to pay
down The ENCYCLOPEDIA BRITANNICA is the most notable work of this character, a work
at which many have looked with a sigh of regret, because of the impossiWity of obtaining it for their
own. But now the man who looked at and longed for the ENCYCLOPEDIA BRIIANJNICA ca
secure it for his own, to use whenever he likes, by sending a sum of Five Shillings. This plan suits
the man who desires to possess good books, but cannot conveniently pay for them if he has to make a
large and immediate payment, or to send in large monthly instalments. The Daily Mail offers the
public a bargain at a price and on a system of payments which places it within the reach of all It is
the best book ever offered to the public—no book is so valuable ;no book, except the Bible, has so
large a sale : no book has ever been sold at such an astoundmgly cheap price, on such easy terms, and
on a system of payment so convenient. Every man who can spare five shi.lings can secure immediate
possession of the greatest book in the world. A free Prospectus sent on Application by post as under.

The issue of the “ Encyclopedia Britannica ” now offered by the Daily Mail (London) is The Times Reprint of the Ninth
and latest Edition as issued by its original publishers, Messrs. A. and O. Black. The work is divided up into 24 volumes of 800
pages each • the 25th volume contains an elaborate index to the whole, and a detailed list of contributors. The handsome volume
measure Ilf inches in height, % inches in depth, and inches in thickness. The binding is, in every case, the best of its kind.
The dark green cloth is as strong as cloth can be, and the morocco used in the leather bindings is so rich m color, so soft at once
and tou-h g so fine in grain, that no one will regret the small extra payment which secures an added dignity and durability due to so
noble°a book? The llncyclopsedia contains 338 full page plates, 671 maps and plans, and over 9000 other illustrations. For the
MS alone of the 30,000,000 words, which occupy the 22,000 pages of letterpress, more than £60,000 was paid to theUMicontnbu
tors and the style in which all this valuable matter is got up makes the work the most costly ever offered to book-buyers. It is
the most costly of books that is now, for a time, within the reach of everybody.
SOMETHING NEW.
Everv subscriber to the “ ENCYCLOPAEDIA BRITANNICA” will receive, without extra cost, an extra (26th) volume of
over 230 pages giving hundreds of suggestions and outlines for courses of reading upon almost every imaginable topic, thus making
the Encyclopaedia available for every member of the family who can read. It points out profit and recreation for everybody.
t The of Systematic Readings” has just been prepared at great expense, and required the combined labors of
three eminent professors, and took over four years to prepare. It cannot be obtained separately.

of the second div. of 6d. (£10,000) still better.

Sons of Gwalia’s new manager, W. J. Loring
who comes to W. A. with a good American reputation, is
making a clean sweep of officials, and evidently intends
practising rigid economy. Besides losing the lode going
north in 6,7, and 8 levels, the grade of ore going south
only ranges from 2£ to 16dwts. for an average of Bft.', so
that it will be hard to maintain output. The 50-stamp
_ ""’i ran days during May, and treated 8031 tons for
51900 z. ; the duty per stamp thus works out 6’4 tons per
day.

Mt. Yagahong Exploration (W.A.) has pub-
lished a map showing the Great Fingall Reef running
through its Great Fingall Main Reef property 60
miles north, and its Abbott property 100 miles north of

immediately adjoining Consols, the Mt. Yagahong people
must possess consummate assurance.

During 1901, Great Boulder Prop. (W.A. )treated
89,121 tons of ore for 152,1420 z. of gold, worth £482,506, or
only £3 3s. sd. per oz. Working costs, ex-depreciation,
came to £227,578, or 51s. per ton, and, cum depreciation,
to nearly 20s. per ton more. For second year in succession
£lO,OOO written off to cover portion of depreciation of
shares in other co.’s, £l5OO off the worthless Konemann
patent, and £2500 off water-pipe line to. Hannan’s Lake,
long since discarded. The balance-sheet is a very un-
satisfactory document, as over £250,000 of alleged assets
are not worth that number of pence. During May co.
treated 8661 tons for 13,8530z5. of crude bars, equivalent
to 10,3350z5. fine gold. A year ago refining furnace was
erected but apparently is not utilised. Output will
shortly be increased when Merton furnaces get to work.

At Fraser’s mine, Southern Cross, it is pro-
posed to erect an 80-head battery to treat 400 tons daily,
to do all development by rock-drill, and to sink large
mam shafts to hold 2 to 3-ton skips, instead of J-ton
trucks. By these means total sinking and working costs
are expected to be reduced to 235. per ton. At recent
Ivanhoe meeting chairman Govett grumbled at ancient
methods in vogue, and small trucks used, yet Paterson’s
shaft was cut down only last year at cost of £12,000 to
allow of 15 instead of lOcwt. trucks being used. A new
shaft double the size could have been sunk for less money.

Hannan’s Oroya (W.A.) during May treated
1293 tons for 15550 z. from its south lease at Hannan’s
Star Mill. As the mill’s capacity is about 1800 tons
monthly, the run is a poor one, and also costly, as the
battery is hired by the month. The rich Brown Hill-Iron
Duke chute is more than fulfilling expectations, some ex-
tremely rich ore being bagged for the smelters. From
the proceeds of gold and the placing of the 14,000 reserve
shares at a high premium the financial position of co. will
shortly be beyond cavil, and the early purchase of a
treatment-plant assured, a.

The mill returns from Great Boulder Persever-
ance (W.A.) during May read 16,0010 z. from 12,068 tons—
the highest so far recorded. Both the Perseverance and
Lake view lodes on this property continue to open up
satisfactorily, and ore reserves are a long way ahead of
imII requirements. It would, however, be more satisfac-
tory for all concerned if the main shaft were carried down
to 2000 ft., and the lodes properly tested there. This
wculd strengthen the co. more than building up a reserve
in British Consols, the stipulation on which Sir
Christopher Furness joined the board.

Brown’s Hill (W.A) May return is 52980 x. from

force.

Ivanhoe (W.A.) won 11,5050 z. from 11,030
tons during May, being a record for the mine. The
costs at the battery are given as 6s. sd. for milling ; ss. 6d.
for cyaniding ; and 6s. 3d. for filter pressing—a total of
17s. 2d. per ton. The mine is well handled, and numerous
economies are gradually being introduced.

It is rumored that Rodda, manager of Mungana
(Ohillagoe), and son of Capt. Rodda, of Associated
Northern Blocks (W.A.), is to take charge of the Asso-
ciated. Gossip also has it that the half-million treatment
plant is to be consigned to the scrap-heap. While plant
exists no profit can be earned, as it is too complicated
and expensive to run and to keep in repair.
South New Moon, Bendigo, presents a very
satisfactory record for the past six months—B2sB tons,
88620 z., £27,000 divs. This means that out of each oz of
gold £3 has been paid as profit. Next half will show’ still
better results, as new plant is now in full swing. Mine

in value at less than three years purchase. What a
“ snap ” it would be for an English corporation to get the
New Moon, S. Moon and Olarence mines at, say, 60 per
cent, advance on the local market values 1

Bendigo mines aggregate less than 4Jdwts. per
ton, and about £1 per oz. is paid in divs. For economical
working this is unexampled, although it is not quite so
good as the mere statement would make it seem, inas-
much as Bendigo ore is the least refractory in the world.
It is the simplest of amalgamating propositions.

Long Tunnel, Walhalla (Vie.), decided to sink
a new shaft 3000 ft. Cost will be at least £25,000. Share-
holders assured by directors that calls will be made as
light as possible. Poor afflicted mortals need comfort.
Who can help sympathising with them 1 They have re-
ceived about £1,250,000 in divs., and what a cruel
wrong it is to ask them now to pay calls!
0.2 per cent, of profits as earned, if set aside,
would have averted this awful calamity, but would not
such a deprivation have meant a cure worse than the
disease? Seriously, the new shaft may be an absolute
necessity for the working of the Long Tunnel as a separate
mine, but it means a shocking waste of money. With the
exercise of a little diplomacy, with legs of puerile preiu-
dice and jealousy among rival mine-owners, with a fair
give-and-take policy such as would avail in any ordinary

“Wurrumbah” (Melbourne) : I am highly
amused at some of the articles on mine ventilation which
appear in the local papers. The writers all chew at the
soft pulp around the outside, but never touch on the hard
m iddle of which is that most of
the shafts in Victoria are much too small, too crowded
with gear, and much too rough in the interior to allow of
anything like adequate access or free circulation of air.
It wants an Act passed to make the size of the shafts
proportionate to their depth, and a limit placed on the
extent of ground to be worked from one shaft. . I have
seen mines here that pay yearly in truckers’ wages an
amount that would sink a second shaft, improve the
airland lessen the cost of all the work in the mine. The
air is better on the Towers at 3000 ft. than in some Vic-
tonan mines at 300, yet in mining this is the parent State.
[ Warrumbah” is chewing the “soft pulp” which he
writes about. The controversy in Victoria is as to the
ventilation of alluvial mines, where the difficulty is to
distribute the requisite volumes of air equally in panelling
faces which may be 300 ft. wide. What comparison can
there be between an alluvial mine and a Towers quartz
mine ? It is excusable in a Towers man to write about
mines working at 3000 ft., but how many of them are
there ? Equally excusable is it for him to believe that
there are cool and fragrant breezes at that depth. But a
matter-of-fact official, Mr. Horsley, the Mines Inspector,
says otherwise: “ The air in the bottom levels of the
deepest mines, although of good quality, is very hot
indeed before the winzes from the next level above hole
through. Then the conditions are improved, but only
slightly, as the workmen are unable to endure any but
the scantiest clothing.” There’s a hard kernel of naked
truth for “ Warrumbah ’’ to crack.—Ed. 8.l

Statistics explain why the lead-market refuses
to make the expected recovery. For the first five months
of this iyear imports into the U.K. were 100,734 tons, as
against 79,671 tons in the same time in ’OO, while exports
from the U.K., which were 21,749 tons in Jan.-May of
00 were only 16,947 tons in Jan.-May of ’O2. America
has been pouring in the metal—accumulated stock,
mainly.

Figures of ’Ol copper production and consump-
tion, and, as far as possible, also of stocks, for the U.K.
and Australasia, U.S., Germany and France, go most of
the way towards a full explanation why standard copper
fell from £7l 2s. 6d. in January to £4B 15s. in December.
The production was not abnormal. The increase on the
preceding year was 16,620 tons, which compares with
recent figures like this 1895 over ’94, 10,700 tons : ’96
2^ er ,„ 9 !>.„ 39 ’ 102 tons ; ’ 97 > 23,520 tons; ’9B, 27,398 tons;
99,46,740 tons ; 'OO, 15,218 tons. But consumption fell
off remarkably. The increase in ’99 over ’9B was 31 738
tons, and in ’OO over 99, 48,198 tons ; but there was a
decrease in 01, compared with ’OO, of 41,032 tons. The
extent of American stocks is uncertain: other
stocks are, notwithstanding the remarkable figures
for last year, only normal. It is not, however,
believed that American stocks are very heavy •
while the recent low prices will naturally result in
increased consumption. But in applying these figures to
future prospects, it had better be remembered that syn-
dic 3 :^ 3 rule copper prices as often as statistics do ; also,
that trade was disturbed several ways last year.

Milner and Kitchener touch the returning gold-

of the gold produced, after deduction of cost of produc-

per oz. on all gold won, without deduction. In view of
the fact that the war was fought as much as anything to

gross output would not seem unreasonable.

Olga Nethersole, who travelled as a young beauty
actress of great promise when Cartwright brought her to
Australia years ago, seems to be mainly a triumph of
Yankee advt. nowadays. Her first London appearance as
Sapho got a very candid notice in the Referee :
“ The play is disappointing, simply because it is so crude
so disappointing, and so dull. . . . There is nothing in
Sapho s passion, as it is understood by the American
author, or indicated by the actress, of the redeeming
quality which should command sympathy for the woman.
Miss Nethersole’s acting seems too often calculated
loud, affected. There are none of those little artistic
touches by which an actress of fine insight and originality
adds something of her own to a part. Miss Nether-
sole goes for the showy effect, and she some-
times reveals a remarkably undisciplined strength in
sustaining a passage at high pressure. But she has not
the style for such a part as this. I don’t suppose there
was a man, or woman either, in the audience at the
Adelphi who felt there was any excuse for Jean’s in-
fatuation ; yet the part of the irresolute young fellow was
very well played by Mr. Frank Mills, whose acting has
more subtlety than Miss Nethersole’s.” Considering that
Olga’s Saphic blandishments and so forth have been the
subject of about 10,000 American press paragraphs, long
or short, it comes as a shock to read that her performance
and her “ style ” show no excuse for the infatuation of her
stage lover. Miss Nethersole’s brother Louis must have
developed into a much smarter business manager than he
was reckoned to be when he used to stand around the d.c.
entrance in Sydney and Melbourne and express wonder
that The Bulletin representative was “ allowed in the

Clarence Holt, Bland’s father, a cheerful and active
veteran of 76, is about to publish his reminiscences.

ago—and Joseph Jefferson, still flourishing in America. 1

Manager George Edwardes says that whereas the ordi-
nary chorus lady in a Gaiety burlesque or comic opera
used to receive £1 a week, she now gets 355., £2, and
£3. This apropos of G.E.’s proposal to raise the price of
stalls —all stalls in London theatres are “ reserved,” the
unreserved seats on the ground floor being “ pit”—from
10s. 6d. to 12s. 6d. Edwardes is eloquent concerning the
increased cost of musical shows and the comparative
cheapness of comedy productions, for which the same
scale of prices is charged to the public. But manager
Collins points out that his shows at Drury Lane cost
double as much as Edwardes’, and are only expected to
run about 13 weeks, yet he is satisfied with the half-
guinea maximum. “In America, where salaries are as
large as here, and where the accommodation is better
two dollars is reckoned sufficient charge for stalls ” says
Collins.

Mr. Jack Marsh, the brilliant profes-

cricketing centres, says:—

Our Electric
“ Invigorators.”
WE do not ask you to believe that an
“ Invigorator” will entirely cure
von of disease, but our “ Invigor-
ators,” used with our medicines, accom- i
plishes that which neither electricity or |
medicine alone can do. . The two together
have wonderful renovative effects, and con-
tain reconstructive elements in cases of
degenerated and enfeebled constitutions
which amaze the medical Faculty. Our
“ Invigorators ” are the only ones tested
by two of Sydney’s leading electricians.
We hold certificates of genuineness unpos-
sessed by others. We have several classes,
which vary in value according to cost of
construction. Our £lO instrument contains
the same current as those at £1 (which we
specially recommend), but it also contains
2oz. of 18et. gold, which raises the value.
If you require a test privately it will be
given you.
We ask you to read these prices and then
give one of these instruments a trial. What-
ever you suffer from where your natural
strength and nerve power is lacking, you
will be strengthened. The desire of a man
is to be with the victors, not the vanquished.
To be strong, hearty, healthy that is your
desire, and it is the effect of the use of this
instrument.

AN OPEN INVITATION.
ALTHOUGH our Stocks are the finest and best-selected, and displayed by us in the most handsome Stores
in Australasia, don’t for a moment think that our Stores are too grand for you, or that you
can get more for your money in a smaller place. If you do think so you make a tig mistake,
and the sooner you give us the opportunity to prove that this is so the better will it be for you.
Does it not stand to reason that we, with our six popular Australasian stores (two more will be opened
in a couple of months, one in Brisbane and the other in Dunedin, N.Z.) can buy in larger quantities and sell at
lower prices than single sho,ps ? Is not the possession of these six stores proof that our prices please the public?
Next time you want anything in our line, come in and see how well and how cheaply we can supply your
wants. It will cost you nothing to look round and get all the information you want, and even if you don’t buy
we won tbe offended. Let the purse be fat or lean, the same careful and courteous attention is given to all.
If you are out of town your name and address on a post card will bring our 1902 Catalogue, and you will see
that We can serve you just as carefully by post as if you were standing before the counter.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I was buying cattle near Uralla, and went out
with Charlie to inspect some in what he called
No. 1 paddock (he had three paddocks) on the
top of Mount Mutton. In case we came across
anything to shoot, we brought a rifle and shot-gun
with us. Found all the cattle but two, one old
bull, and one yellow bullock.
Seeing a storm gathering, we made for home,
and, while cutting across the paddock, we found
the yellow bullock with his head fast in a dry
spou,t. Evidently he had put his head in after
some thistles growing at the bottom, and in
attempting to withdraw, his horns caught and
held him prisoner. I got a pole, and jamming it
down the side of the spout, broke off enough to
allow him to free himself. Immediately he saw
me he lowered his head and charged. I made for
a large, burnt-out hollow stump, and as I dodged
round ft I tripped and fell. The next moment I
was hoisted in the air and fell head-first down the
stump, where I jammed with my arms pinned to
my sides.
At the bottom, coiled up asleep and within
about two inches of my head, was the largest
diamond snake I had ever seen. Charlie was
calling out to know if I was hurt, but I dared not
answer him for fear of waking and disturbing the
snake, and the bullock would not let him near the
stump. Just then the storm broke, and the rain
pouring down, trickled past me and began to fill
up the stump. . The snake floated —then woke,
uncoiled, and tried to make his way up, but could
not get further than my hips. He drew back,
and putting his head inside my shirt, worked
round my body and tried that way without
success. Finding my body warm he worked his
head under my arm, and coiling himself up as
well as he could, seemed satisfied to leave it at that.
During this time I did not move a muscle, for
fear of getting the snake riled. The water
was getting higher in the stump, in fact it was
trickling into my ears. Death by drowning was
below, and death by snake above; and death by
rush of blood to the head was imminent. Also,
there was the bullock. I could hear Charlie try-
ing to coax the beast away, but he would only
charge and then return to the stump, seeming to
know he had me there.
Suddenly, there was a blinding flash and a
deafening report.
When 1 recovered, Charles was pouring muddy
water on my face. Looking round, I found the
stump had been splintered to atoms, and the bul-
lock and snake were dead alongside—struck bv
lightning.
The snake seemed very full, so we cut him open,
and found a large goanna inside, which was in turn
ripped open, when out jumped a live ’possum. It
made up the nearest tree, but had not gone far
when a large eagle-hawk, that had been soaring
round, swooped down, snapped him and made off.
I immediately picked up the shotgun, and blazed
both barrels together after the hawk. It must
have been because the cartridges were damp ;
anyhow, the gun burst, and blew the top of my
right ear off, besides singeing my eyebrows and
moustache. Charles brought the eagle and ’possum
down with the rifle.
We found: the bull in No. 3 (sheep) paddock.
He bad fallen out of No. 1, and, missing No. 2
(horse paddock), landed in No. 3, at the foot of
the mountain. He was all right, but had fallen
on and killed one of Charlie’s best stud rams.

Balfour’s sentiments per cable :
He said that the sentiment which •'adjnspiwl the
colonies in giving military assistance to Great Britain had
opened a new chapter in the history of the empire.
A chapter in the history
Of John Bull land—observe the text—
And J.B. understands it is
“ To be continued in our next.”
Strange and hairy extract from a strongly
Jingo and Seddonite paper—the Canterbuky
Times (M.L.) : . .
The acting-Premier's view of the Islands question is the
almost inevitable, opinion of a Maon and states-
man who sees the Island races misgoverned or neglected,
the trade of the South Pacific languishing, and the Com-
monwealth of Australia adopting stringent measures to
shut out the black peoples. That federation under Maori-
land control <vould be the best and safest solution of the
problem is undoubted. . .
It is, indeed, a moral upheaval to find British
rule in the Islands denounced as neglect and mis-
government—this, after the Boers have been in-
formed severely for three years that British rule
means freedom, justice, wisdom, and all the rest
of it ; also to find Oom Seddon and co. proposing
to rescue the Fijian from the British oppressor.
HAVE YOU
A BAD LEG
with Wounds that Discharge or otherwise, perhaps sur-
rounded with inflammation and swollen that when you
press your finger on the inflamed part it leaves the impres-
sion ?If so, under the skin you have poison that defies all
the remedies you have tried, which, if not extracted, you
never can recover, but go on suffering till death releases
you. Perhaps your knees are swollen, the joints being
ulcerated; the same with the ankles, round which the skin
may be discoloured, or there may be wounds ; the disease
if allowed to continue will deprive you of the power to
walk. You may have attended various hospitals and had
medical advice, and been told your case is hopeless, or
advised to submit to amputation ; but do not, for I CAN
CUKE YOU. I don’t say perhaps ; but I WILL. Because
others have failed is no reason for not now being cured.

power. A Whole Band in One Instrument, and anyone can learn to pay it.
No knowledge of music is required. The HARP-O-CHORD is an elegantly
finished, high-class instrument, sold at a price within the reach of all. Its

Our New Selection.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A summer’s night. Inside—close, suffocating ;
outside—calm, tranquir, not a sound, not a sign of
life. The Bush silent, restful. Dad on the
verandah, in his easy-chair, thinking ; Dave, Joe,
and Bill stretched on the grass near the steps
dreamily watching the clustering stars. Close to
the house the eerie note of a night-bird suddenly
broke out. Joe and Bill turned over to locate it.
Dad and Dave took no notice. The moon came
slowly over the range; weird shadows fell before
her and crept over the earth, and Budgee plain
was a dim expanse in the hazy, languid light.
Dad spoke.
“Whose stock’s on Lawson’s selection now?”
he asked. „
“ Everyone’s,” Dave said— Carey s mostly. }
“Well, turn everything out t’-morrer that am t
Dave sat up and chuckled.
“And the Careys’ll run ’em all back, Joe
joined-in, “an’ put ours where we’ll never see ’em
aS “'lf they do I’ll make it warm for them,” Dad
said.
Bill laughed. . . ,
“You wasp, get inside and dont be gnnnin
like a d d cat at everythin’ y’ hear ! ”
Bill whined and said he wasn’t gnnnin .
“Well, hold y’r noise then,” Dad shouted.
Then he dragged his chair nearer the steps and
spoke softly. “T’-mofrer that selection’s mine,
he said—“ Lawson’s thrown’t up.”
Dave mounted the steps. “ Wot, after fencm (
“After fencin’,” and Dad chuckled and sat
back, and no more was said.
• * * *
Next morning Dad repeated his instructions
to Dave to turn all stock off Lawson’s selection,
and started for town in the sulky.
At the Lands-Office he was told Lawson’s selec-
tion was in the Ipswich district, and late in the day
he left for home, intending to take train to Ipswich
the following morning.
Dad pulled up at a wayside pub. Several men
were leaning on the bar, their empty glasses before
them. Dad invited them all to drink. They
drank. Dad lingered awhile and enthused about
dairy-farming. Se exaggerated largely, and spoke
of Saddletop as though he owned it all. The men
became interested, one in particular. He was a
Carey, and Dad in his exuberance failed to recog-
nise him. Carey’s horse had got away, and he
was walking home. He had twelve miles yet> to
tramp, and when Dad asked the company if any
of them wanted work, Carey said he did. Carey
knew Dad. ~ ,
“Jump into th’ trap, then,” Dad said, an
I’ll drive y’ out.”
Carey climbed in, and Dad drove off ; and all
the way along he boasted of his possessions and
prospects. Carey was an attentive listener, and
encouraged Dad to talk. Dad took a fancy to his
companion, and in a lowered voice, in case some
of the trees or fences concealed a pair of ears,
became confidential. He revealed all he knew of
Lawson’s selection and his intentions regarding
it, and, approaching Carey’s own place, he whis-
pered hoarsely: “Nice set of scoundrels live
there ! ” His companion never flinched.
“ Whose place is it ? ” he asked.
“ Carey’s,” Dad said—“ a bad lot o’ wretches !
and Dad shook his head in the moonlight.
Dad pulled-up at the gate. . .
“You camp in th’ barn there,” he said, indi-
cating the building with a sweep of his ha,nd, “ an
tackle tli’ milkin’ m th’ morning with th’ boys.
Then Dad unharnessed the mare and went inside.
The “ man ” went home chuckling.
Next morning, Dave and Joe and Cranky Jack
Were in the yard milking; Dad came out.
“Where’s thet feller I brought out las’ night—
not up yet ? ” he asked.
Dave didn’t understand. Dad explained and
hobbled off to the barn. The man wasn’t there.
Dad returned to the yard, swearing.
“That cove wouldn’t be after work Dave
drawled—“ he had y’; he only wanted a lift.
Plenty of ’em about.”
Bill, bailing-up, stood and laughed. Bills
hilarity always annoyed Dad. He chased Bill
out of the yard, then roared to him to come in
again. Bill slunk back. .
“Go in there”—Dad pointed the way through
the rails. Bill hesitated sullenly. He dropped
his head and turned the whites of his eyes on Dad.
“Y'heart” ,
Bill moved sideways to the rails, then judged
his distance and dived. But he miscalculated.
His head struck the bottom rail and he rebounded,
and Dad got in his kick and grinned, and forgave
the man who had taken him m the night before.
* * * *
Dad reached Ipswich at night and strolled
about till he found a place to put-up. Then he
went into the streets again and gaped at things.
But he didn’t see many sights. There was a large
store with the shutters up ; the pallid light of a
few flickering gas-jets revealed the outline ot an
old, weird, weather-worn fountain, around which
the Army crouched and yelled for the salvation of
souls; and a church fence; and a policeman, motion-
less. At regular intervals a huge clock broke the
silence. It had a sad, unhealthy note, and seemed
to toll a requiem for the dead. Dad stared up at
it and wondered.
* * * *
Morning again. Dad halted at the foot of the
Lands-Office steps and stared in surprise. _ Old
Carey was feeling his wav down them with a
stick. Carev saw Dad and grinned. Dad went
into the office and came out immediately, breath-
ing heavily. He went down the street and
searched for Carey and missed the train.
* * * *
“ How’s it y’ didn’t get it?” Dave said in an
unhappy kind of voice.
Dad gave no reason. He sat down and thought,
and we all stood round waiting as if something
was going to happen. , , , .
“ They’ve got it all right,” Dad groaned at last.
Then Dave’s opportunity came.
“ Yairs ” —he said—“an’ they’ve got all our
cattle —pounded everyone o’ them, an ten shillings
a head damages on them.” _ . _
Sarah rushed out, so did Bill and Tom , but
Dave and Joe held Dad down and sawed the
furniture.
STEELE RUDD.
Re the frequently-commented-on inade-
quacy of Sydney hotel fire-escapes, The Bulletin
hopes soon to see the extensive adoption of some
such contrivance as the Maoriland invention
recently experimented with in Sydney and illus-
trated in these columns. Recognising that the
quickest way of getting down from aloft is to fall
down the inventor’s device is simply to let you
fall— modifying the descent , into a series of rapid
slides through a zig-zag canvas-shoot.
A very aggressive argument against reduc-
tion of State 0 Parliaments is that,_ with fewer
members and equal representation, the backblocks
constituencies would become too large to be
handled. As a way out of this, it might be sug-
gested that if 2000 electors in the backblocks have
one member, then 4000 electors in a large town
might also have one member, only that member
might have two votes. He would only collect one
salary, and make one speech, and. it is to be
hoped, get one culvert for his constituents, and
the arrangement would simplify things consider-
ably.
“6 x 8”: Besides being probably the
most stolen-from paper, The Bulletin seems to
be the most stolen. A friend of mine recently
posted three successive Bulletins to Maoriland,
but not one arrived. In small bush towns the
postmaster, telegraph-boy, and their respective
friends generally go through the “ B.” ere the
addressee gets it—that is. if he does eventually
get it. In back-country Schools of Arts and free
reading-rooms the attendants always keep such a
sharp eye on the red cover that it’s uncomfortable
to be reading it under such vigilant regard. Said
a Mechanics’ Institute caretaker once to me:
“ It’s always The Bulletin they shake ; never the
other weeklies.”

cooed the old man caressingly.
“ Put it back ! ” snarled the giant.
“ bright; Jim ! ” sighed the patriarch, replacing
the hat on the seaman’s head and adjusting it
infinite care. Then they resumed their discussion
and, because it wasn’t any of my business,
stopped at the window behind them and 11 st ®"® .
“ Don’you never do that again, Bill ole boy,
the seaman was grunting warnmgly
I glanced round and beheld the old man regard-
ing his friend with a look of mild astonishment.
“ W’y not, Jim ?.” he said. ,
“ ’Cause I won’t stand it—you dam ole swab !
“Oh, I say, Jim. I—l give yer th at y
The'seaman reluctantly admitted the fact. X
know yer give it t’me.” „
“ I’ad it ten year’fore I give it t you, con-
tinued the old man sorrowfully. ~
The seaman laid a heavy hand on his shoulder
and laughed mirthlessly. “I don t care if yer
had it since yer was born,” he said.
The ancient mariner looked thoughtful and
shook his head. “ I didn’t ’aveit that long, Jim.
“Well yer can ’ave th’ rotten thing back now
t’ keep fowl-feed in, if yer want it,” continued the
giant, listlessly. “I wouldn’t care a curse it
lost it overboard or anythin’ now—l ve sorter lost
all interest in it. D’yer want it ? ’ And lie took
it off and offered it to its former owner.
“ Don’ want it ! ” gurgled that elderly person.
The seaman twirled it carelessly on his finger
and looked at it in every possible way. “1 > am t
growlin’ ’bout th’ ’at—it’s you I’m growlm at,
he announced finally, ramming on the head-gear
and staring insolently at his aged companion.
The old man started violently and braced him-
self up against the verandah-pole. “Wots—
wot’s wrong with me?” lie gasped.
“ It’s your way,” explained the giant.
“Wot’s my way ?” , ..
“ Makin’ a fuss ; failin’ round th ship after me
an’ givin’ me yer ole clothes,” growled the seaman
angrily. “Why don’t yer shove off th’ rubbish
on some of th’ others? Anyone ’ud think th
ship wuz a work’ouse an’ you wuz th fussin ole
lady visitor, an’ me yer ole pet pauper !
“ Nobody thinks that, Jim,” reproved the old
man. , , ,
“I know they don’t,” shouted the enraged sea-
man. “ I’d kill any fool that did ! ”
“Nobody don’t think” commenced the
ancient. , ,
“But it ain’t that;” snapped the seaman,
evasively.
“ Well, w-wot is it ? ”
“Oh, it ain’t th’clothes I’m growlin’ at—they
suits me—more or less. I know I drinks wot I
makes, an’ clothes is always handy. Wot I ob-
ject to is the way you- come crawlin’ round criti-
cisin’ me after I’ve got ’em on. That,” he con-
cluded, tapping the old man on the chest— thats
wot gets me down ’bout you ! ” .
The ancient mariner gazed at him in perplexity.
“I’m—l’m only admirin’th’style yer put inter
’em,” he muttered apologetically.
“ Well, don’ do it,!”
“ Wot’s th’ matter ? ”
“ This ! ” hissed the seaman instantly. “ D yer
remember th’ pants yer put in me box at Liver-
pool?” . „ „
The old man blinked at him stupidly. Yes,
he grunted. ~ , , , T . .
“An’ we went down th docks an I met two
girls I knew, an’ we started talkin’. In the
middle you tells me how much yer gave fer th’
pants an’ where ver got ’em. Then blowed if yer
didn’t ask th’ girls wot they thought of’em !
“ Wot ’bout it ?”
The seaman panted indignantly. Wot erbout
it ! Wy, that’s wot yer alius doin’—sneakin
round givin’ lectures ’bout somethin’ I got on that
uster belong t’you. Look ’ere, now,” and he put
out a sunburnt paw and shook his benefactor by
the shoulder, “you drop this game or you’ll die
d’yer ’ear?”
“Yesh,” blurted the old man wearily. I
won’t do it no more. Come ’long.”
“ Don’ go forgettin’ now ! ”
“Oh, come’long,” groaned the old man, stag-
gering off. V .
Opposite the Seamen’s Home a group seized on
Jim. The ancient stood off awhile until he got
tired of waiting, then, when the group were deep
in conversation, he sidled up to a quiet-looking
man in the rear of the party.
Just when they seemed engrossed in a story
being told by the man with the shade over his
right eye, I noticed old Bill suddenly grab hold of
his new acquaintance and lead him round behind
Jim. Then I saw him pointing to the back of
Jim’s coat, and I knew his doom was at hand.
Two minutes later there was a wild scramble, and
presently, out of the confusion, Jim appeared,
violently propelling old Bill towards the front of
the hotel. , , , , , , ,
As I turned to go, I beheld the aged one struggle
out of the trough in a water-logged condition, and
endeavor to wring the green slime out of his grey
hairs, as he gazed reproachfully at the stray
policeman, who just then wandered up, and
threatened to arrest him for bathing in a public
place.

EVIDENCE.
SURRY HILLS.
Mr. Jos. Grieve, Wood and Coal Merchant, 18
Albion-street, Surry Hills, states “ For the past
five or six years I suffered from kidney disorder-
The symptoms were severe backache and irregu-
larity of the secretions of the kidneys. The
pain had such complete mastery over me that at
times I could not rise from my bed. I went to
doctors to see what they could do for me, but
gained no benefit from them. I tried medicines
with no better results. One day, I saw an adver-
tisement regarding a remedy for kidney trouble,
and I visited Newman’s Pharmacy, in King-street,
and procured a box of these pills—Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills. I felt relief right from the
first doso. My pain gradually grew less, and
finally disappeared, as did the kidney disorder.”
This is Mr. Grieve’s testimony given 12 months
later Twelve months ago I was cured by
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. lam still a
believer in these pills, having never had a return
of my complaint since. I had been a terrible
sufT rer with the kidneys, and nothing ever gave
me relief but Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills. If I
honr anybody complaining of a bad back I always
tell them of tbe medicine which cured me. 1 '
BALMAIN
Mr. E. Hansen, 41 Rosser-street, Balmain, says:
“For years I had a backache which made ms
helpless and a burden to myself. I also had my
right arm useless, and could not do any work. I
had to use my left arm to feed myself. I was
unable to earn my own living. I tried a lot of
medicines, and went to doctors and hospitals. I
would get slight relief, and then I’d get as bad as
ever again. I took fourteen boxes of one largely-
advertised remedy, but when I started work one'
day’s labor made me as bad as ever again. Hun-
dreds in Balmain know of my case, and any of
them will tell you what Doan’s Backache Kidney,
Pills have done for me. I got a box more than
twelve months ago, and when I had taken half a
box of these pills I felt so well that I could start
work. But knowing how I had been treated by
other remedies I finished the box to make sure,
and then I began work and have worked ever
since. My right arm is as strong and as well as
my left, and all my pains have gone. I’ve not
taken a pill since because I’ve not needed one.
They acted in a most magical way, as men in the.
will tell you.”
WOOLLOOMOOLOO,
Mr. Charle9 Alexander, 143 Riley-street, Wool-
loomooloo, this city, says:—“While working I
am obliged to lift heavy articles, and this, I be-
lieve, affected my kidneys, as about two years ago
I began to feel severe pains in my back. Many
widely advertised medicines were tried without
gaining any advantage. An attack of influenza
left my kidneys in such a state that I could
scarcely bear up against the pains. A doctor
treated me for Bright’s Disease. I could not turn
in bed, and my back felt as if someone were trying
to cut out the backbone. I was wholly confined
to my bed when a friend came to see me, and re-
marked that Doan’s Bachache Kidney Pills had
relieved him wonderfully. So some were ob-
tained for me at Newman’s Pharmacy in King-
street, which entirely cured me.”.
The above is what Mr. Alexander said one year
ago. He repeats his testimony to-day, and says :
“Since I gave the above testimony 12 month sago
I have had no reason to change my opinion. I
had tried medicines which have been extensively
advertised, and also drank stuff prescribed by
doctors, but I would never fall back on any of
them, but Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills were
cheap at 10 times the price- Some of the kidney
medicines I have taken wore like swallowing
knives to out away the disease, but Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills were mild, and thoroughly
effective.”
Get what you ask for. Get
DOAN’S. Don’t accept some-
thing .just as good. All Chemists
sell DOAN’S Backache Kidney
Bills and will give you what
you call for. Some may
endeavor to substitute an article
they make more profit on.
Insist on getting the genuine
and save money and misery.

On the Northern Track.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I dreamed you came by the Northern Track
When the moon hung in the west—
When the turning tide through the straits swung
slack
In a silver glory drest.
There were stars in the skies, but brighter far
Did your ship-lights seem to me—
Oh ! the blazing beam of her masthead star
Was a tiling for the gods to see;
I had longed—l had longed for you day and night„
How fiercely I dare not tell—
For your laughter tossed to the breakers white, —
For the tones of an old ship’s bell.
T dreamed as you near and nearer came,
Till the tall spars touched the skies,
You would call me soft by that old, old name
And laugh in vour big grey eyes.
There were garlands fair on tiie old ship’s bows
When she swayed to the storm that day
And broke the rope of our knotted vows
And drifted across the bay.
Her bell tolled !—tolled ! —and your hot tears fell,
Yet how could I call you back?—
Oh God ! I have heard that moaning bell
For years on the Northern Track.
I dreamed—’twere better I had not dreamed —
As you rounded the headland gray,
That Life would seem as it once had seemed
Ere you drifted away, away ;
I watched you veer where the channels turn ;
I could hear the steer-chains wail,
And I looked for jewels that used to burn
In the heart of each s\\ elling sail.
The moonlight glittered on cabin-panes—
Oil ! the joy of her bo’s’n’s call !
And the heavy anchors with golden chains ;
I would laugh when I heard them fall.
The steamers drive on the Northern Road,
But I trow their wrenching rods
Could never lift from my heart the load
Laid there by the angry gods.
There are stars above, but the only star
That brightened my path at all
Fled north, and died where the palm-trees are
And the island breakers fall.
Her heart was breaking—l knew that well—
And I might have called her back ;
Oh, God ! must I always hear that bell
Toll l toll! on the Northern Track?

A Little Letter from London.
London, April, 1902.
Dear Friends,
Australians in London, when they get together,
frequently give utterance to the expression of a
strong wish : “Oh, that some one would tell the
truth about Australians in London —to Aus-
tralia ! ”
To read Australian papers at this distance is
partly amusing, partly pathetic. Distorted facts,
absolute lies, false impressions abound. It is
positively startling to read about people whose
daily doings and public careers here are well-
known to you, and find what ’is said of them in
Australia. How far, far away is Sydney from
London ! So much, much further than London is
from Sydney. Yet London is more accurate in its
news of Sydney than Sydney in its news of
London. The news from Sydney is measured by
the quarter-inch. That may account for the
general absence of false impressions in it. There
is no room for anything but solid truths.
Another reason for the frequent misrepresenta-
tions in Australian papers is that girls over here
write home glowing accounts of themselves and
disparaging remarks of other artists, and these
circulate and get added-to. They are generally
of little or no value.
m What Australians, then, are undeniable suc-
cesses in London ? Successes beyond all cavilling,
beyond all doubt ? Their names, alas ! are sadly
few. So few that they do not stand out iii bright
glaring prominence from the crowds of famous
Londoners, and cause everyone over here to gasp
with admiration, and say: “What a wonderful
country, Australia ! ”
That, I assure you, is never, never said. Even
less, if that were possible, is it thought.
The names of these few, to come to the bed-
rock of the matter, are limited to, say, six : Melba,
Haddon Chambers, Ada Crossley, Amy Sherwin,
Florence Schmidt, Oscar Asche—four singers, one
dramatist, one actor. From Australia, no artists,
no writers, no musicians, no poets, have lifted
themselves above the middle rank of innumerable
English men or women of like professions, and
made a name that stands out. incontestable, and
widely known.
Amy Castles’ recent appearance here did no
little damage to the Australian singing profession.
An elderly critic rose, at her second concert, and
left the hall after hearing her sing “Hear ye,
Israel,” exclaiming, “If this is what Australia
sends us I shall stay away when Australians are
singing.” It was an unlucky thing that he should
have heard her in that most difficult of all arias.
She sang it with a “ cheeky ” little Australian air.
“Hear ye, Israel” from her lips was divested of
every shred of dignity, and might have been the
call of one school-girl to another. But you have
heard her for yourselves by now, and can judge
for yourselves. The general impression she made
in London was far from favorable for other young
singers proposing to come here and take the town
by storm. There you- have the ill effects of a
boom.. Her friends spared no efforts to make her
concerts successful. Tickets were sent to Austra-
lians. A friend of mine sent back the money for
the tickets sent her. It was promptly returned
with a note asking her to accept the tickets, and
spend the money in floral tributes.
But no ! London is not to be won by floral
tributes. One cannot help admiring the stern re-
sistance this old city makes to anything that is
not done in its own set traditional way.

Many peop e would like to see him as Ulysses in-
stead of Tree, who is cold, nonchalant, and thin.
Oscar Asche (from Sydney, where his mother
still lives) is near the top, but you won t see
much about him in Anglo-Australian papers He
is above all that I suppose-doesn t need puffs.
Australians who are doing well, but not known
much outside their own acquaintances, are Jbouis
Beeke, Albert Whelan, Bertha Rossow, Mrs.
Maesmore Morris, Henry Lawson, B. E. Minns,
Percy Spence. You might mention these names
a thousand times a day to different people here in
their own professions respectively, and none would
have heard of them. Yet they all have plenty of
work to do, and perhaps in Australia you imagine
their names in everyone’s mouth in London.
, „ r , , .-hrr C n/r U \ „
Albert Whelan (Waxrnan of Melbourne) seems
likely to make a name. He made the quickest
startof any Austraban He was engaged a few
flays after his arrival to take Ernest Shand s place
at the Empire. He pleased the house so well that
the management gave him a four weeks engage-
.ment. He then went straight into the. Belle of
New York ’ where he took Oscar Girard s old
part. Whi e that play was running he had to
leave to fulfil an engagement m Liverpool m
pantonrme, which lasted two months This was
foUowed by a fortnight at the Tivoh, where 1 ,e
was billed as the “Australian and
got the biggest reception of the evening. He has
been four months in London, and there are just
four months of engagements—a decidedly lucky
career. At present he is going round the theatres,
getting new copy for his nunnery. Presently he
goes on at one of the halls, where he will do Dan
Leno, Rutland Barrington and other London
celebrities. , , ..
Australians are menaced by an evil peculiar to
themselves They come here to get on They
leel Australia eagerly waiting to hear that they
have got on. They goad themselves, feverishly.
They exaggerate every little step they take. They
rush to the British Australasian with pars.

The BrTtish Australasian, in my opinion, does

DEECHAM’S
PILLS
Are the Best and Safest Family Medicine.
This assertion is made very seriously, and after duly weighing all the reasons
that lead to the conclusion. If Beecham’S Pills were novel, untried,
and experimental, like so many modern advertised compounds, such a positive
statement could not be put forward. But everyone knows for <X JaCt
Beecham’s Pi s Is have stood the searching test of over fifty years
continuously advancing popularity, until to-day the demand for this specific
in all parts of the world is greater than ever. With a certainty, the universal
verdict of"common sense everywhere justifies the claim. And then, again,
Beecham’s Pills do not require the publication of testimonials to
maintain their tremendous demand.
tM
Because those who once try BEEGHSAM’S
PjILS are na uralSy impelled to inform
o hers of the benafits to be derived
therefrom. This is pe haps a slow, hut
it is certain!]/ an honest and a powerful process, and in tJiis
way the confidence and esteen sf the public have been
la-tingly secured.
No other Medicine in the World can claim
so many regular users.
Thousands of families always keep a box of ©©©ctlSs.l'S'll’S Pills in the

may be administered and further trouble and suffering averted. Nine-tenths
