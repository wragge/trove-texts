MADAME BLAVATSKY
In his Madame Blavatsky: Medium
and Magician (Odhams) John Symonds
has written a competent and convinc-
ing biography of one of the most
remarkable personalities of the 19th
century. It presents a psychological
problem which has been the major dis-
ruptive factor of the present century;
that of the single individual who has
the evangelistic power to set in action
a movement which affects the actions,
the mental processes and the lives of
millions.
Madame Blavatsky arrived in New
York at the age of forty-two, a
monstrously fat woman weighing nine-
teen stone, and with just enough money
to pay for her keep in a rooming-
house and the pound of tobacco which
she claimed to smoke daily. Within
five years she had acquired a follow-
ing largely made-up of cranks and
mystery-mongers, but with a fair
sprinkling of accredited intellectuals
of the day.
Among these was a gentleman
named Colonel Olcott, a lawyer, and
an active man of affairs. During the
Civil War he had served in the Federal
forces, mainly in a political capacity,
having been selected by the Govern-
ment to investigate charges of corrup-
tion in various Government depart-
ments and in the Navy. He proved
himself to be an extremely efficient
detective of fraudulent conspiracies, so
much so that when the war was over
he was commissioned by the “Daily
Graphic” to investigate various
spiritualist seances.
At that time the spiritualist move-
ment was more-or-less universal, and
had spread to the States in an extremely
virulent form. Madame Blavatsky saw
in it the opportunity she was looking
for, which was* to exploit her potent
personality as a back-parlor magician
and make some urgently - needed
money. She joined one of the more
notorious spiritualist circles and there
met Colonel Olcott.
If Madame B. had not captured
Colonel Olcott it is doubtful if she
would have achieved her status of the
high-priestess of occultism. The
colonel was no crank. He tackled the
investigation of alleged spirit-
phenomena realistically, and when he
detected a fraud he exposed it. But
there was much in it that he found
inexplicable, and it is by the inexplic-
able that all credulity is established.
His conversion to the occult was by
the particular brand of occultism
propaganded by Madame B.
Though Colonel Olcott was a
middle-aged married man with a
grown-up family, he deserted it to
establish a menage with Madame B.
and become her organising-manager
and disciple-in-chief. There was noth-
ing sexual in this union; if Madame
is to be believed, she was examined
medically and certified incapable of
sex. She had been married at the
age of sixteen to a very old man, and
had left him within the year of her
marriage. Her unwieldy body and her
face of a Calmuck primitive in any
case hardly made her attractive.
The menage established by Madame
and the colonel became the central
meeting-place of those intellectuals
who had thrown overboard orthodoxy
and were wandering in limbo for a
religion to replace it. There Madame
wrote her immense tome “Isis Un-
veiled,” from which the Theosophical
Society was derived.
Where she got all that esoteric stuff
is hard to say. It is as old as recorded
civilisation and is generally credited to
that mysterious people the Chal-
deans. Through the years it has
accumulated something from all creeds
and doctrines, East or West, and
amalgamated them into a rehash under
the heading of “the ancient wisdom.”
It is the sort of thing that Russians
in particular, with their desperate
inability to grapple with reality, appear
to absorb through their skins. Of the
Russian passion for abstruse dialectics,
Conrad observed that to hear two
Russian intellectuals talking one might
almost believe that they understood
what they were talking about.
Madame B. was an adept in con-
vincing others that her knowledge of
the Ancient Wisdom was imparted to
her from divine sources. Her spiritual
control was a Mahatma named Koot
Hoomi. Scepticism is inclined to sus-
pect that hashish was her major
source of inspiration. She had one of
those camera-memories which regis-
tered everything she had read or heard,
and apparently she could go on writing
for hours in a state of
without needing any reference to the
works from which she extracted her
subject-matter. To Colonel Olcott this
remarkable performance was tangible
evidence that she was the instrument of
a divine revelation.
It proved to be an amazingly effec-
tive evangel, spiritually and financially.
When the pair of them set-off for India
they had just about enough money to
pay their fares and set-up a meagrely
furnished establishment. Within a
short space of years they had acquired
a palatial headquarters, a host of dis-
ciples, Indian and European, and in
their own lifetime had spread the
gospel of Theosophy through Europe,
Asia, America and Australia.
The woman who had done this
remarkable feat remains a phenomenon
—a sport on the human species, not to
be easily classified under the slick
terminologies of psychology. In her
normal aspect she was a crude and
vulgar woman, capable of going from
extremes in raffish laughter to satanic
rages which frightened those about her.
If she wrote in the seraphic terms of
the Ancient Wisdom she could use the
vulgate of abuse like a street-walker.
Asked to pass the butter to someone
who had probably offended her, she
hurled the dish across the table,
exclaiming, “Here it is. Grease your
soul to hell with it!” As a medium she
descended to all the back-parlor magic
of the seance, with faked cabinets,
butter-muslin spooks, apports, raps,
bell-ringings, flowers from nowhere
and all the other stale devices of
alleged spirit-phenomena.
Some of her most effective illusions
were due to her undoubted power as a
mesmerist. Like Hitler, she had the
mesmeric eye, and therein lay her
power to quell resistance and subject
others to her will. Much has been
written about that eye. But it could
not have been so effective if its com-
pulsive force had not been generated
by a self-engrossed egotist and a
religious fanatic . . .
All leaders of the people, religious
or political, are composed equally of
charlatanism and fanaticism. Without
that amalgam they could never gain
a control over the mass-mind.
Credulity can only be established in
those infantile mental processes by the
performance of miracles. Richard
Hodgson, who investigated Madame
Blavatsky’s alleged phenomena for the
Society of Psychical Research, wrote
of her, “We regard her neither as the
mouthpiece of hidden seers nor as a
mere vulgar adventuress; we think she
has achieved the title of the most
accomplished, ingenious and interest-
ing imposter of history.” What else
can be said of all the people’s
messiahs?

D’Arcy Niland’s The Big Smoke
(Angus and Robertson) is a most
curious novel about an old fight-pro-
moter in Sydney who once had a star
boxer named Frankie Tarcutta whose
mother was a half-caste aboriginal
girl named Milcie and whose father
was the famous Jack Johnson.

U.N. AND POWER POLITICS
TXAVING sat since September 15, the
fourteenth General Assembly of
the United Nations closed its session
in mid-December apparently with no
greater general effect on world tran-
quillity than at previous sessions.
In fact, no year passes without some
ardent member, a supporter of good-
will and antagonist of aggression,
falling from grace and giving a display
of violence.
The last year has seen all the Arab
countries, so firmly loyal to U.N.
principles in theory, snapping at each
other from distracted capitals in which
their leaders, from Nasser downwards,
need to go about with heavily armed
guards if they wish to survive until
the New Year.
Cuba, the country which led the
hue and cry against the actions of
Britain and France at the time of the
Suez affair, celebrated the end of the
U.N. session with its 557th execution
—in a year in which Panama was in
the throes of a “go-home-Americans
campaign.” And the social highlights
of the session were addresses 'from
those great and peaceful democrats
Comrade Khrushchev and the Presi-
dents of Mexico and Guiana.
All the members joined in sponsor-
ing a resolution for “general and
complete disarmament,” which nobody
shows the slightest sign of taking
notice of. Directly after its passage
some of those who were involved in
the session were arming like one-thing
and pushing their troops into tactical
positions along other people’s borders
—Nasser along the Israeli border and
Kassem along the Jordanian and
Persian borders, where his troops killed
a few Persians during the week by
way of limbering up.
A piece de resistance of the debates
consisted of four days’ argument
which culminated in a resolution de-
ploring the “continued disregard” by
the Soviet Union and the “present
Hungarian regime” of earlier U.N.
resolutions calling on them to co-
operate with the Assembly’s special
representative, Sir Leslie Munro, in
investigating the facts of the liquida-
tions of the 1956 “rebellion,” and
asking Sir Leslie to continue his
efforts. The resolution had the spon-
sorship of 24 Powers, headed by the
United States, behind it, but when it
came to the vote, 17 countries
abstained from voting and the tally
was 53 to 10.
lyrß. HENRY CABOT LODGE, who
1 A moved the motion on behalf of
Washington, interpreted it to mean:
“To the Soviet Union and to the
authorities in Hungary it says, ‘Obey
the Charter and restore the independ-
ence and liberty of Hungary and—
with particular urgency—stop perse-
cuting and executing Hungarians for
what happened in 1956.’ ”
So far from being either impressed
or distressed by this order, the culprits
held a meeting in Budapest, at which
Khrushchev gave the world Com-
munist parties a lecture on the need
to take their directives from Moscow
as the head of the Communist world-
revolution and to continue in unity
with the good work of liquidating the
capitalist system wherever it existed.
His speech praised the Hungarian
Communist leaders, who were present
grinning through their bloodstains,
while their delegates orated in the
U.N. Assembly. Khrushchev included
a few pointed remarks about the fate
of Communists outside Russia who
broke with Moscow’s leadership. Tito
received some direct and ominously
threatening attention and responded in
kind.
In the U.N. Assembly itself the
representative of the Kadar Govern-
ment said flatly that Hungary intended
to take no nptice of the U.N. resolu-
tion. which must have been obvious
to everybody from the beginning. If
Kadar’s coterie showed the slightest
sign of taking notice it would certainly
become Russian gun-fodder in short
order. Nobody laughed when the
Hungarians asked U.N. to “help us
extricate ourselves from being used in
the cold war.”
The next item of real importance
was Korea. South Korea continues to
exist by maintaining the largest stand-
ing army in the Western world apart
from the American one.
U.N. “reaffirmed its objectives”
respecting the sad half-country which
depends from China like the tongue
of a man being strangled.
Seventeen brave fellows once more
joined the rush to abstain from voting,
lest Moscow become offended. That
they were not ready to commit them-
selves to the ideal of “a unified, inde-
pendent and democratic Korea under
a representative form of government,
and the full restoration of international
peace and security in the area,” proves
how seriously they take the Kremlin’s
expressed aspirations.
The Middle East occupied a con-
siderable part of the meeting, with the
usual runnings-away every time any-
thing came up which might be unpalat-
able to the Soviet Union or its near
allies or satellites.
The decision to spend over £AIS
million on relief of refugees, mainly
those displaced from Israel, as the result
of an almost forgotten resolution which
has bred most of the real trouble in
the Middle East, is a fairly sound
indication that there is no expectation
of quiet solutions of the dreary and
hopeless lot of the cast-out Arabs.
The growth of the world’s popula-
tion held the stage for some time, but
the discussion produced only agree-
ment to differ, though it was found
easier to establish common ground in
the decision to raise about £45 million
to assist 35 countries and territories
on 31 projects of economic develop-
ment.
It is remarkable how eager even the
almost total-abstainers on more vital
questions affecting peace become when
asked to vote for something that
promises to bring a few free pounds
into their own bailiwicks.
'T'HE peace of the world seems to have
A been affected not one iota by the
discussions on the East River Bank in
New York, but it must be admitted
that the organisations of U.N. are
doing good work on projects which
affect health and living-conditions in a
great many countries, even though
most of the projects could probably
be carried out just as well by smaller
bodies more representative of those
who do the paying.
The financing of schemes such as
that for a six-year survey to try to
wipe-out the locust plague in Southern
Asia and Africa and the vast
Children’s Fund organisations is
notable for the fact that the Com-
munist nations are content to allow
the imperialist West to do most of
the paying.
On the whole, each session of the
Assembly seems to see its main objec-
tives receding and being replaced by
humanitarian projects, while the efforts
to secure permanent world peace fall
more and more into the realm of
Power politics operated by the same
old great Powers on which true U.N.
supporters used to look askance as
dictators of international policy and
doctrinaires of force who should be
replaced by a world consortium in
which great and small alike should
wield only moral power.


DIPPY NEW YEAR!


PLAIN ENGLISH
Suez and the World
The United States was responsible
more than anyone else for allowing
Nasser-to break the Egyptian agreement
with the Suez Canal Company in a
flagrantly immoral manner. There has
rarely been such an outrageous breach
of an international contract as that per-
petrated in 1956 with the connivance of
great Powers.
Ever since, Nasser has been pampered
and cajoled by U.N. and U.S., though
with growing insolence he has taken what
he could get from the West and at the
same time played a double game with
the Soviet Union.
While he pretends to denounce Com-
munism, it is the Russians who are to
build the Aswan Dam and the Russians
who have provided him with his defence
material which he has used to turn
Egypt into an armed camp, with uniforms
everywhere and tanks kicking-up the
dust on all the roads leading to Suez.
The Suez Canal was “freed” from its
developers and rightful owners clearly
on the understanding that it would be
an international waterway even if
Egyptian property. But this obviously
is not Nasser’s view, and he is using it
as an instrument in his siege of Israel
which he and his Arab friends have
determined to destroy.
Apart from the fact that he has large
bodies of troops in the vicinity of the
Israel borders near the areas which the
Israeli Government intends to irrigate
to provide for fresh batches of immigrant
settlers, he has set himself out to strangle
Israeli commerce as part of his war on
the little country, by blockading the
Suez Canal against ships carrying goods
to and from Palestinian ports, and
especially those carrying Israeli exports.
A Norwegian ship carrying Israeli
imports has been tied-up at Port Said
for a long period because Nasser has,
in effect, declared a restriction on what
the ships of other nations trading through
the world shall transport through the
canal. And he has also held up a
Greek freighter carrying goods to
Somaliland from Israel. Strangely
enough, there does not seem to be any
word of his ever having held-up Ameri-
can oil going to or from Israeli ports.
His actions have apparently been con-
doned so far by the United Nations and
the World Bank and other agencies in
which the United States have a say, but
the news that the World Bank was con-
sidering lending the United Arab Re-
public £25 million to widen and re-equip
the canal, which Nasser treats as his
private waterway, has proved too much
for a large section of the U.S. Congress,
and 66 members of the House of Repre-
sentatives have sent strong telegrams of
protest to the bank and to the U.S.
Acting Secretary of State, Mr. Dillon.
The World Bank has, however, ignored
the protest and has granted the loan.
It feels it is necessary to “provide a
deeper and wider canal to let bigger
tankers through.” So long as Nasser is
prepared to play with the oil industry
he can do anything, apparently, and the
U.S. Acting Secretary of State’s only
comment is that the bank is an “economic
institution” and should not be used to
exert diplomatic pressures.
Memory seems to hold an instance or
two when the bank was roped in, and
in connection with Egypt, too, to do
just that.
Nasser’s restrictions on the use of the
canal are a matter of interest to Aus-
tralia as well as to other nations, and
it is astonishing that the unpleasant
tyrant in Cairo has been allowed to get
away with his arrogance and impudent
flouting of the principles of the U.N.,
of which his nation is a member and
which he has used to the limit ,for his
own purposes in the past, invoking the
Charter to justify his demands and
actions.
At present he probably feels safe in
going to any length, with the pliant Mr.
Hammarskjold tolerant of everything he
does and the U.S. State Department
seemingly ready to let him go any length.
He will be doubly encouraged by the
replacement of the Canadian commander
of the U.N. Emergency Force (which has
supposedly been keeping the peace on
the Israeli and Jordan borders) by an
Indian who can be expected to have a
passive attitude.
Risks in Overseas Capital
At the right time, with the renewal of
the overseas-investment controversy, fol-
lowing G.M.-H.’s latest capital move,
the Institute of Public Affairs Victoria
presents the pertinent figures on it
generally.
Since the war Australia has received
a total of £1424 million of overseas
capital, of which only £24 million is net
Government borrowing; the balance,
£l4OO million, represents private invest-
ment.
Overseas payments for interest, divi-
dends and profits have increased from
£33 million in 1948-49 to £6B million
in 1958-59, and dividends and remitted
profits now represent 5.2 per cent, of
export income compared with 3.7 per
cent, in 1948-49. Interest takes a smaller
percentage of exports than formerly.
The institute points out the main risk
associated with heavy capital-inflow is
its uncertainty from year to year. In
1958-59 net capital-inflow was £177
million, enabling Australia to ease import-
restrictions and to finance a large trade-
deficit with a loss of £lO million only
in overseas reserves.
Without this capital-inflow, Australia
would have been faced with economic
difficulties.
Without overseas capital investment
our post-war development w'ould not
have been possible. Economic growth
would have been much less rapid, our
population smaller and our industries
less efficient.
Despite the risks attached to it, this
does not mean they should not be taken
to attract overseas financing; but there
is a limit to the amount of foreign capital
the economy can absorb.
Avoiding Controversy
IJTrom Street”]
One of the self-confessed chief aims of
the building-committee of the new
National Art Gallery and Cultural
Centre of Victoria has been to get on
with the job without controversy, and
this was one of the reasons for not con-
ducting a competition as in N.S.W.; but
the committee with unanimity chose as
architect Roy Grounds, at least one of
the most controversial professionals in
the nation.
Dr. Leonard Cox, the committee’s
chairman, said Grounds was chosen for
his unique combination of youthful vigor
in design and maturity in practice. He
is also loquacious, argumentative, dedi-
cated and a man of remarkable drive ;
his assurance, when he was appointed,
that he would devote himself to the work
until he carried it through would have
been taken for granted by the committee.
The examples around Melbourne of
his domestic architecture, including zig-
zag and round and other unfamiliarly
shaped houses, which at first looked like
curios built for browbeaten clients, now
emerge, in most cases, as the precise
house for that location, with the lasting
good taste of the better modern design.
Some of the owners, however, feel
uneasily that the architect, having charac-
teristically put everything he could into
the work at the time, still regards their
house as his.
On the gallery and cultural centre
plane, his chief work is the Academy
of Sciences at Canberra with its breath-
taking interior beauty. It has become
the chief tourist-attraction in Canberra.
The £3-million centre will be built on
Wirths’ Park site, near Princes Bridge,
the area which the late Sir Keith
Murdoch persuaded a Dunstan Govern-
ment to reserve for it, with an auditorium
and galleries rising from a garden setting.
It will be built probably in 1962 and
1963, if the inevitable controversy about
the Grounds design has been settled by
mid-1961.
Sydney's "Green-belt"
So far the Cumberland Planning (Green-
belt) Scheme in N.S.W. has been notori-
ous mostly for the opportunities it has
provided different citizens, through fore-
knowledge, “intuition” or sheer good
luck, to profit handsomely, after rezon-
ing, at the expense of original holders
who were frightened off their property
by the plans of the planners.
Even Federal Budget proposals “leak”
at times, and in the case of rezoning of
green-belt and other lands it seems to be
quite impossible to prevent knowledge
getting out to speculators in advance of
official announcements, to the great
advantage of the speculators.
Now that another 46 square-miles of
green-belt (rather a lot, in this case,
for speculators to cope with) has
been released for housing, indus-
trial or other purposes at the order of
P. D. Hills, N.S.W. Minister for Local
Government, one wonders what good
and legitimate purpose the green-belt


proposals have served to date. They have
made land for housing and factories
harder to buy for at least a decade, and.
have inflated the cost of construction
throughout the Sydney metropolitan area.
Like most Labor Government controls,
they have helped to create unnatural
scarcities and a species of blackmarket.
Although the Cumberland County
Council, which appears to be a trier
without much Government help, has
managed to acquire various areas
which will be added to the State’s park-
land, the vital county-roads scheme is
still only on the planning-board through
lack of funds. And in its last report
the Cumberland Plan chairman lamented
that, through amendments to the Local
Government Act during 1959, “thefe will
be ultimately 40 schemes and 40
ordinances applying to the Cumberland
County District, though one piece of
land will be subject to only one scheme.
This will mean that there will eventually
be no plan or ordinance called the
County of Cumberland Planning
Scheme.”
County planning is good provided it
is well conceived and carried out with
reasonable expedition and freedom from
political motives. From the start the
Sydney plan appears to have been
basically a thing of Labor Government
politics, and however sincere the co-opted
planners themselves may have been, from
the State Government angle it seems to
be finishing-up in the same kind of mess
as other State Government projects—
especially local-government projects.
Australian Design
Essington Lewis is chairman, and
Colin Barrie, a Melburnian with an
engineering and commercial background,
is director of Industrial Design Council
of Australia, which has hoisted itself
aloft in ICI House, the new Melbourne
skyscraper, and afloat with an offer to
help design Australian - manufactured
articles.
The council consists of 25 members
with academic, industrial or commercial
qualifications, it is financed chiefly by
donations from business enterprises and
receives £2OOO a year from the Com-
monwealth, a token blessing from the
Government in contrast with the English
set-up where it is a branch of the Board
of Trade.
Its purpose is to enhance standards of
design, and manufacturers seeking advice
on the design of their products will get
it personally from Colin Barrie. This
service is limited to advice on aspects
of appearance design, but will encourage
better standards and should be of im-
mediate help to industry.
The dissatisfaction with the design of
some Australian products began to be
expressed most vigorously more than a
decade ago, and there has been only a
gradual improvement since. The coun-
cil’s view is that many otherwise worthy
products fail short of an overall com-
pleteness in design and finish, and atten-
tion to a few aspects of design could
raise the standard of products from
mediocre to good.
It is not generally realised how far
Australia is behind the field. Industrial
design was professionally established in
the U.S. in the ’twenties, and now over-
seas countries undertake research and
give high training in industrial design.
There are few facilities for training
designers in Australia, and local industry
could find itself at an increasing dis-
advantage.
The council’s aim is to make a country,
whose leaders talk optimistically of great
exports, inquire at least into the local
requirements in design-training.
Reds and the Cry of "Wolf!"
The cry of “Wolf!” has now been heard
so often over Communist actions that
new encroachments on Western terri-
tory cause little interest. It is easy to
believe, studying a long stopping-and-
starting series by Moscow and Peking,
that there has been design behind these
false-alarms and that the Red leaders are
conditioning the world to lose its sense
of danger and to scoff at the idea that
the Communist World Revolution will
ever make a continuously moving advance
against the West.
The atmosphere has dulled the power
of apprehension of most newspaper-
readers, and manoeuvres that a few years
ago would have caused general excite-
ment are now subordinated to minor
events in the press.
There is no doubt that there is a
slow but sure Chinese movement of
pressure on the northern Indian borders
and those of India’s neighbor pro-
tectorates.
The signal has all along been a con-
ciliatory approach by Mao or his
Ministers couched in such a way that
the authors of it know it cannot be
accepted. Refusal is followed by a little
more aggression.
Thus, hard on the heels of the news
that Peking's cunning request for a con-
ference with Nehru on terms of which
acceptance by the Indians would have
constituted a committal to the view that
China’s rights to certain indubitably
Indian territories was debatable, it was
announced that a large force of Chinese
troops had been concentrated in Tibet
near the Nepal border. A day or two
later, according to dispatches from
Khatmandu, the capital of Nepal, part
of this force crossed the Nepalese border
in the west at a strategic point and began
cutting timber to build barracks,
obviously with the intention of occupy-
ing part of the little country.
The Chinese, of course, are already
in occupation of the Indian territory
which Chou En-lai wished to discuss with
Nehru, and the details which have come
out about the seizure of this land, the
killing of Indian troops and the cap-
tivity of others who have now been
released leaves no doubt about the nature
of the Chinese forces and of their kin-
ship with the suppressors of Hungarian
liberty.
The Indian Government has protested
to Peking that the treatment of its police
snatched off Indian-held land in Ladakh
was “harsh and inhuman and opposed
to all the canons of civilised behavior.”
The leader of the captured patrol in
his official report declared that he and
his men were fired on without warning,
subjected to continuous questioning and
brainwashing and held without adequate
shelter from extreme cold and denied
medical treatment for their wounds or
frostbite.
One constable, badly wounded in the
stomach and left behind with two
Chinese soldiers, was never heard of
again.
It appears from the report that the
Indian prisoners were first put into a
six-foot-deep pit ordinarily used for
storing vegetables. Interrogation ex-
ceeded all the bounds of permissible
military questioning, and prisoners
were repeatedly threatened that if they
didn’t give the right answers they would
be shot.
The questionings were aimed to make
the Indians say that they had invaded
Chinese territory knowingly and as an
act of deliberate aggression against the
peaceful Chinese; that they had fired
on the Chinese first and had been treated
with great kindness by their captors.
Some of the men, weakened by
hunger, frostbite and continual question-
ing, signed general statements, but
repudiated them as soon as they were
freed.
There does not seem to be much
promise of the world peace, which Mao
and Khrushchev profess to desire so
urgently, while Communist nations are
fathering incidents like those in Tibet and
along its borders and while the Soviet
Union and its satellites are prepared to
defend in world debate the horrors of
Budapest.
If, as has been suggested, the Chinese
Government has now laid claim to the
Mustang district in north-western Nepal
in connection with the occupation, it is
about the most depressing bit of news
the world could have for a Christmas-
box.
The “wolf” reported in India seems
real, hungry and ferocious. <r>
Japan and Our Pearlshell
There are some strange features
of Australian - Japanese relations con-
cerning Jap pearling activities and the
Australian claim to sovereignty over
the continental shelf. Although Japan
accepted Australian restrictions on pearl-
ing-areas only on condition that Aus-
tralia’s claim was submitted to the Inter-
national Court, that body has not got
around to hearing the case, which has
been listed since 1954. The conference
in Perth was told recently that the deter-
mination and organisation of the Japa-
nese and their willingness to put up with
discomfort and lower wages were the
reasons for their dominance in many
sections of the pearling industry. It
seems time Parliament was told what
the prospects are for the pearlshell
industry, and the reason for the delay
in the hearing of the continental-shelf
claim.


THE DEAR DEPARTING
“I don't feel old,” the Old Year said,
“I’m sprightly and I’m full of joy.
Don’t say tomorrow I’ll be dead,
Don’t leave me for that wretched boy—
“A little boy without a stitch,
A child of no experience /” —
The Old Year was exceeding rich,
So what he said was full of sense.
His friends enthused : ‘‘You mustn’t go!
We need your brains! We need your
skill!”
The Old Year said, ‘‘Well, anyhow,
I’ve cut the brat out of my will!”
‘‘How just!” his friends said. ‘‘How
sublime !
A noble and defiant note!”
The Old Year said, “/ mind the time . . .”
And told a boring anecdote,
Whose upshot made the rafters ring
Till midnight brought a stirrup-cup
And they departed, wondering
How the old scoundrel would cut-up.

TXZho’d have ever thought -it? A

“Durward”: I’ve just received the
usual Christmas letter from Hans, now
a journalist in his native Oslo. His easy
English reminds me of 1944, when we
were co-members of the polyglot crew
of a Wellington in Coastal Command.
Taff, the bomb-aimer, was, in fluent and
feeling Cymric, complaining of the
dilatoriness and inaccuracy of Jock, the
rear-gunner, in supplying him with a
drift. Jock's spirited defence came in
violent and vituperative Gaelic. Stephen,
our Canadian skipper, Max, the navi-
gator from Brisbane, and I, the Mel-
burnian tail-end Charlie, contributed our
verbal and vernacular mites to the sym-
posium. Only then did Hans, the wire-
less op.-intelligence type, come over the
inter-com. to inquire in cultured tones:
“Will not any of you lovely bastards
speak English?”
“C.A.A.”: A furore was caused among
stamp-collectors when it was announced
that two of the new series of four
Antarctic stamps might contain a flaw.
Apparently the presses missed-out on
some of the sd. and Bd. varieties which
were overprinted to take care of the
revised postal charges. It caused the
biggest rush on an Australian new-issue
since the Olympic Games, but at time
of writing there had been no reports
of any discoveries. I must scrutinise my

During that time he has paid £l5OO

how owners can bear to part with such

a Melbourne firm listed a number of

■pEAD with great interest B. S.
Baxter Cook’s reference to
W.M.H.’s hearing-aid (B. 18/11 /’59).
“Billy” was a director of the wireless-
company which employed me, and we
were certainly kept up to it when he
visited Melbourne for War Cabinet meet-
ings. There were two rooms, one at the
Treasury Buildings and the other at the
Barracks. Before the meetings every-
thing pertaining to the hearing-aid was
perfect—checked and double-checked
and given every test possible. But a
technician was always kept available for
the period of the meetings. We were
never left idle; sure enough an SOS
would arrive—“ Billy” was in trouble.
Getting into a War Cabinet meeting
was no easy feat, even to those holding
every pass possible. Half-an-hour’s
delay was usual. I well recall one time
at the Treasury buildings. Apparently
Billy had no interest in the matter being
discussed, and by throwing (not placing)
his earphones on the table, and turning-
on the volume, he started the “buzz”
(“feedback” to the technical) to which
Mr. Cook refers. No matter how many
times he was shown how to use it, he
always blamed the equipment. On this
occasion I entered the room to see and
hear all members (save one) in fits of
laughter—l can still see Sir Thomas
Blarney and John Curtin roaring their
heads off. All that could be seen of
“Billy” was his posterior protruding
from beneath the table where the ampli-
fier was housed.
That drawing of Low’s with steam
issuing from his nostrils was as “Billy”
was that day. After listening to his
abuse of me and my ancestors for at
least five minutes I proceeded to repairs.
He was undoubtedly a great politician,
but his radio and mechanical knowledge
was nil. Everything that was removable
was thrown everywhere. Thank good-
ness he didn’t have pliers or soldering-
iron to have a go at the innards! Five
minutes saw him back “on the air,” and
at least one “War” decision had been
made—by me —to try to dodge “Billy’s”
jobs. Yet I was to meet him many
times. With the end of the war or
his resignation from the War Council
(I forget which) peace reigned once
again among the radio-technicians.

He wrote a letter himself, pointing out
that this was not the only failure of the
Government to appreciate the strength
of local feeling abroad, and suggesting
they get their “man in Sydney” to report
more fully on the secession movement
in northern New South Wales, and con-
cluding with a call to all Australian
secessionists in London to join a march
to the office of the Agent-General! When

At lunch-time she rang her mother to
say she’d landed one in a big city

thused Mum ; “what doing?” “Answer-
ing the telephone to customers’ com-
plaints,” said daughter. “But, darling,
what on earth would you know about
that sort of job?” objected Mum.
“Nothing at all. That’s why they put
me there. You see, in the Christmas-

take the message, and they sort it all

tween them. They gazed abstractedly
into their drinks. Words would have
been superfluous in that communion of
tragedy mutually shared. Toulouse
Lautrec could have painted them. I
said as much in the saloon-bar. When
the raucous mirth died down, Mac ex-
plained : “We call that pair ‘The
Melancholy Revellers.’ They’re regu-
lars ; they pass their lunch-hour like
that every day without speaking a word.

“An industrial-psychologist says that statistics

You may think the saw-milling log-man,
The girder-borne, high-swinging dogman,
The deep-diving, salt-water frogman
Would be in high danger the most,
Along with the mine-shaft descender,
The sparks-girded, white-hot-steel ben-
der ;
The coves who the furnaces tender,
And could do a premature roast.
Yet year in and year out they toil,
With serene disregard for their skins.
They rarely get clutched by a coil,
Or caught in the cogs by the pins.
And one reason there is.
No, it’s not better nerves
To assist harm-prevention ;
It’s this: in their biz
There are no nifty curves
To distract their attention.
In the factoiy, though, woe betide him
Who works with a doll parked beside him,
Especially when she’s soft-eyed him —
And that’s quite a likely event.
Though round him the steam may be
hissing,
He gets to be dreaming of kissing,
Forgets—then three fingers are missing,
Perhaps, or some part of him bent!
He may look back to screw-off a leg,
Take a gink at a neat golden tress,
Then —bang ! —he trips over a keg
Or nearly walks into a press.
Of co-working of dame
And of hombre for bread
I’ve no wish to disparage.
Yet this point I must claim :
It’s worst hazard’s the dead-
Ly exposure to marriage !

Conan Doyle
in Australia
By ALEC H. CHISHOLM
< t A USTRALIANS,” Sil"
Arthur Conan Doyle
JL declared in 1921,
“are really a very
good-natured people.”
Accepting that statement as
sincere (and possibly more-
or-less accurate), it seems
desirable in this centenary year
of Conan Doyle’s birth that
some Australian should re-
ciprocate his sentiments —
should proclaim that we in
this country found the famous
Englishman to be thoroughly
good-natured, uncommonly
tolerant, and in general a very
decenf bloke.
It is scarcely necessary to
add, in the light of Doyle's
record as a resolute fighter
for any cause he believed in,
that he was not amiable to
the point of tolerating a hit
below the belt. Thus, in Mel-
bourne, he swung a hefty
punch at the “Argus,” which
had treated him in shabby
fashion ; in New Zealand he
did the same thing with
another paper that behaved
badly; and in Brisbane he
became very annoyed with a
couple of boors who asked
him vulgar personal questions
at a public meeting.
I’m reminded of the Queens-
land episodes by an inscrip-
tion which the author of The
Adventures of Sherlock
Holmes wrote for me in a copy
of that book. Here it is:
With all pleasant remembrances
of Brisbane—in spite of the mos-
quitoes (one or two of which were
human). A. Conan Doyle.
In passing, I should confess
that Doyle did not give me
the Holmes book ; I presented
it to myself. The fact was
that, as a writer on the staff
of the old Brisbane “Daily
Mail,” I had been associated
with the visiting lecturer for
a couple of weeks, and at the
end, anticipating that he
would give me one of his
books as a memento, and that
it would be a volume on
Spiritualism, I went along to
his hotel with the Sherlock
Holmes book in a pocket.
Sure enough, Sir Arthur
handed over an inscribed copy
of The New Revelation,
whereupon (after acknow-
ledging that gift) I produced
the Holmes item and suggested
that he. might autograph it
as well.
“Certainly,” he said, with an
indulgent grin, and promptly
scribbled that tribute to Bris-
bane, with a side-swipe at the
local mosquitoes human
ones included.
T first met Conan Doyle and
his lady in a train. They
had come to Queensland from
Sydney by the old Darling
Downs route, and, as was the
journalistic custom at the time
of their visit (1920-21), I went
to Ipswich in order to talk to
them during the last lap of
their journey.
The contact having proved
agreeable, my editor asked me
to cover the whole of the
Doyle activities in Queens-
land, and so I not only re-
ported the public meetings but
accompanied the pair on
sundry outings.
Once, for example, we
found ourselves visiting an
apiary on the outskirts of the
city, and there, to my
astonishment, Doyle revealed
that he was having his first
experience of beehives —this,
if you please, from the man
who had retired Sherlock
Holmes to a bee-farm!
One of the paddocks on the
apiarist's property carried a
number of semi-tame wal-
labies. Well - fed, graceful,
alert, they sat up and looked
us over doubtfully.
“I wish,” said Doyle, “that
I could go and stroke one of
those creatures. “But” —and
his tone was genuinely sad
—“my fondness for animals
isn’t usually reciprocated. Why
this should be I don’t know,
but I never seem to be able
to win their confidence in the
way my wife does. She ‘gets’
them every time.”
Thus acclaimed, Lady Doyle
went into action —to the
accompaniment of soothing
noises she approached one of
the wallabies. Alas, though,
Sir Conan and Lady Doyle (decorated with face-nets)
among bees near Brisbane.
that wallaby let the lady
down ; when she drew near
he turned smartly and hopped
off into the middle-distance.
TXoubtless Lady Doyle did
in fact possess a “way with
animals” —lots of women and
some men have this happy
asset and, personally, I
rather regretted that she failed
to establish good-neighbor
relations with her first wallaby.
Sir Arthur, too, tried him-
self out with an original Aus-
tralian, in this case a white
cockatoo, when we looked
over the aviaries of Maurice
Baldwin (then secretary of
the Queensland Turf Club) in
a Brisbane suburb.
“A man in London once
told me,” he said, “that any
smart bird will respond cor-
dially to a certain ‘magic’
word. That word isn’t found
in the dictionaries. It is
‘koopa-ku’.”
“Well,” I suggested, leading
him to the cocky’s cage, “what
about experimenting with this
fellow? He’s probably as
well-informed as any other
bird.”
“Koopa-ku, Cocky,” said
Doyle.
Cocky twisted his head
slightly. He also raised his
crest.
The big man, putting his
face closer to the cage, said
more emphatically, “Koopa-
ku, Cocky ; koopa-ku.”
“Grrrrrr!” screeched Cocky
—and on that indefinite note
the experiment ended.
I don’t imagine Conan
Doyle took that episode at
all seriously. In fact, although
he was interested in the
aviary-birds and the semi-tame
wallabies, he was more im-
pressed by the local fauna

POLITICAL POINTS
How lean is our Green Belt!
• •
Heffron says his Cabinet will make
no decision on the appointment of a
new Chief Justice of N. S. Wales until
some time in January. What he really
means is that it will make no announce-
ment until some time in January.

According to Paul Brickhill, people in
Britain are “losing the urge to migrate.”
Who’d have thought J. B. Priestley’s
grouch against Australia would take
effect so soon?
• •
What’s happened to the alleged
resourcefulness of Australians? When
a semi-trailer spilt its load of 150 44-
gallon drums on the Pacific Highway
south of Gosford it caused a traffic-jam
which stretched back 35 miles and took
hours to untangle. Hundreds -of
motorists watched the driver and two
policemen work to get the drums off the
highway. If only a few of them had
formed a working-party the job could
have been done in a matter of minutes.
• •
Vic. Railway unions’ Stop-Start-Go-
slow regulation-strike was called-off over
Christmas allegedly because it would
have disrupted Christmas train-traffic,
but really because as a result of it some
classes of railwaymen were working
irksomely long overtime and were fed-
up with it. The unions’ New Year
resolution is to begin it again, but there’s
little enthusiasm for it among railway-
men.
• •
Perhaps the most significant happen-
ings of 1959 were China’s savage crush-
ing of the Tibetan “rebellion” and the
subsequent breaching of India’s northern
frontier. These actions have done more
than any Western propaganda could
have done to awaken India and the new
nations of Asia to the real nature of the
Red Chinese regime.
• •
Criticising the current Australian coins,
lan Sykes, of the Decimal Research
Association, said on a Melbourne radio-
station that the penny and the florin, the
ha’penny and the shilling were so close
to each other in diameter that it pre-
cluded their use in certain coin-classifying
and counting machinery. No doubt he’s
right, but the ooker-machine fraternity
don’t seem to have any trouble.
U.K. Prime Minister Macmillan leaves
London on January 5 on a tour of
Africa. He will visit Ghana, Nigeria,
Rhodesia and Nyasaland before arriving

South African part of the tour will
include visits to Basutoland, Swaziland
and Bechuanaland, the three British
colonial “islands” surrounded by South
African territory.

The British T.U.C. inquiry into strikes
is meeting with little success among the
bigger unions. Of 185 unions catechised
about 70 have replied that they have
had no strikes in the past four years.
Another 60 have given answers, but
some of the bigger ones like the Trans-
port and General Workers’ Union, which
has 1,200,000 members, say they have
no chance of enumerating all the stop-
pages in which they have been involved.
• •
Comrade Khrushchev’s Christmas gift
to President Eisenhower consisted of 40
trees and shrubs. Any poison-ivy
among ’em?
V • •
Indonesia is swinging further into
despotic military rule every day. The
latest signs: a martial-law decree estab-
lishing close control of domestic oil-
distribution and an announcement by
Soekarno that he is about to order the
abolition of “insignificant political
parties”—which probably means all
parties opposed to Soekarno.
• •
Someone once suggested that we could
civilize the Russians by teaching them
cricket, and now there are suggestions
that Australian brewery-machinery may
be used to produce beer to wean the
Chinese Communists off rice-wine.
Judging from some of the stoushes
around Fitzroy and Darlinghurst at
closing-time, beer is likely to make Mao’s
people even more belligerent than at
present.
• •
“Stromlo”: Few Australians give much
thought to the Indian Ocean side and
responsibilities of this continent. How-
ever, we should pay more attention to
it as a result of our share in the 124-
million dollar 11-nation survey to be
made under the co-ordinating direction
of Robert Snider, of New York, chair-
man of the ocean-resources panel of the

tee on oceanography. Aim of the expedi-
tion, which will require at least 15 ships,
will be to improve the lot of nations
bordering on the Indian Ocean, including
ideas on vastly improved fish-harvesting.
Britain, U.S.A. and Russia are among
the participating nations, as well as Aus-
tralia.

THE NOT-SO-"GREEN" BELT


Although more than 100 self-service
petrol-vending machines are operating
satisfactorily in Victoria after normal
trading-hours, the N. S. Wales Govern-
ment refuses to allow Sydney motorists
a similar service. Its Factories and Shops
Act provides that automatic vending-
machines must observe the same hours
as shops, and Minister for Labor and
Industry J. J. Maloney won’t consider
amending the law.
Deputy Opposition-leader Willis says
this “is typical of the horse-and-buggy
attitude of the Labor Government.” Not
quite. In the horse-and-buggy days self-
service horse-troughs were permitted to
operate 24 hours a day.

Frank Forde missed the Labor pre-
selection for Flinders in next year’s elec-
tions for the Queensland Assembly by
one vote —an experience which has be-
fallen him twice in the past on even
more important occasions, Once the vote
cost him the leadership of the Federal
A.L.P. (and consequently the Prime
Ministership). More recently he lost the
Flinders seat to Country-party candidate
W. Lonergan by one vote.
Another ex-M.H.R. had better luck
in the preselection; W. F. Edmonds,
former member for Herbert, won the
Townsville South nomination com-
fortably.
Selection of all Labor candidates was
made by the Q.C.E. on the plea that
redistribution of electorates had made it
too difficult to conduct individual ballots.
There has been considerable dissatisfac-
tion caused by this, critics claiming that
a Left-wing ticket dominated the selec-
tions. There’s a move to have all
nominations referred to the Labor-in-
politics convention in February.

Which is the world’s greatest maritime
nation? The U.K.? U.S.A.? Japan?
Russia? None of those, of course!
Liberia wins hands-down! At least, if
idle shipping is any guide, the port of
Monrovia has more laid-up tonnage than
any other port in the world —it had
1,871,825 tons on December 1, against
the U.K.’s 990,378 tons, U.S.A.’s 609,092
tons and Panama’s 739,811 tons. Liberia,
of course, is a registry-port of conveni-
ence only. It allows shipowners to
operate their vessels on lower wage-
standards and other conditions than

Country-party leader Davis Hughes

Pat Morton with R. W. Askin, who

D. B. Muirhead, of the Australian
Meat Board, back from a five-month
mission to North America, says there is
a continuing market for Australian meat
in the United States, provided it is
approached in a sensible manner. The
U.S. is self-sufficient in all grades of
quality meat. Australia’s opportunity
lies in supplying lean meat for the
sausage- and ground-meat trades. This
is blended with the surplus fat-trimmings
from choice U.S. grades. Muirhead
stresses the importance of exported meat
being true to description ; poor market-
ing could lose Australian suppliers the
good reputation they have built-up in
America.

“C.M.”: State Liberals in N. S. Wales
didn’t find 1959 an easy year, but they
plucked up heart at the close, and will
face 1960 in the belief that their own
efforts will accelerate the underlying and
conflicting pressures beneath the fa?ade
of the Heffron Government. The
psychological effect on Government and
public of two defeats on the floor of the
Legislative Assembly is not under-
estimated, and the expulsion of seven
Labor M.L.C.s from the A.L.P. will be
even more unsettling to the Cabinet and
caucus. New leader Bob Askin has done
a conscientious job in a post made diffi-
cult by the gibe that the Liberals are
always looking for a new Messiah.
Some formerly slack members of the
team have been given the hint to smarten
their ways or make room for others.

In 1959 space-scientists advanced from
artificial satellites to artificial planets.
The Russians put the first man-made
planet, Lunik I, into orbit round the
sun on January 2, and on March 1 the
U.S. base at Cape Canaveral successfully
steered Pioneer IV into planetary orbit
on a path that will take it round the
sun in 394 days. Both pieces of iron-
mongery are believed likely to remain in
orbit “as long as the universe lasts.”
Which means they could outlast all other
works of man.
Getting back to more short-lived
missiles, a Soviet moon-rocket, Lunik 11,
hit the moon on September 14 and on
October 7 Lunik 111 sent back to the
earth pictures of the moon’s hidden side.
Several U.S. attempts to send a rocket
tound the moon failed. Both countries
have been sending animals on guided-
missile excursions and some have been
recovered, apparently none the worse for
the experience. U.S. rockets have been
“manned” . by mice and monkeys;
Russian by dogs and rabbits.
There has been much talk of the train-
ing of U.S. space-men, but actual trips
seem a long way otf. This month it was
reported—though not from Russia —-that
in unsuccessful attempts with manned
satellites the Russians had already lost
several men.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Some firm and
unequivocal assurances have been given
by Territories Minister Hasluck to the
white and native peoples of New Guinea.
Hasluck tackled the rumor of insecurity
and scotched it. “We are not going to
pull out of the job,” he said, adding that
the job would finish only when the
Territory, in its own time and in the
way of its own choice, attained self-
government. This certainly meant
government by the predominant
majority, who were the indigenous
people, and whose rights were respected
and future protected. In advancing
towards the final goal, however, the Aus-
tralian also had his rightful place in the
country. Both then and now the peoples
needed each other and could serve each
other. On that footing security and
mutual benefit could be firmly founded.

“The Count”: Author of Shoot to
Kill (“Red Paged” this week), Richard
Capel Hanmer Miers joined the South
Wales Borderers just after I myself had
joined them. „ As a subaltern he earned
the monicker of “Mallet,” because of a
big head on top of a lanky frame. He
looked slightly unorthodox on the
parade-ground in those days, and could
usually be relied on to say the wrong
thing in the middle of a regimental guest-
night—though in such a pleasant way
that no one could possibly object. When
it came to training for war, though, he
had ideas. We were together in the
machine-gun company, where there was
considerable rivalry between platoons in
skill-at-arms and smartness of gun-drill.
“Mallet’s” mob might lack polish, but
they never missed their target, whether
shooting direct, indirect or on night-
lines. In War 11, with East African
troops in Burma, he picked-up a D.S.O.
and a lot of sensible ideas —later added
to during the post-war trouble in Greece
—for dealing with Communists (“eccen-
trics,” he calls them). I haven't seen


him for some years, but reckon he hasn’t
changed much —records of the Malayan
campaign show how his unorthodox
methods of warfare have paid dividends,
and he’s still happily speaking his mind
at the top of his voice and is able to put
it into print concisely and with good
humor.

Born at Aramac (Q.) in 1878, John
Arthur Porter (“Spinifex”) had his first
Bulletin contribution accepted in 1903,
and he’s still going strong.
Having learned to ride and shoot as
a ma'tter of course, Porter (sketched here-
with) left the family property as a young
man and spent some years wandering in
the outback of Queensland and Western
Australia, horsebreaking, kangaroo-
shooting and digging for gold and opals,
until the Boer War broke-out, when he
came to Sydney to join Colonel Airey’s
Ist Bushmen’s Contingent. (Incidentally,
he remembers Morant, “The Breaker,”
being knocked-back by the English
roughriding - sergeant, who said he
couldn’t ride well enough after a test
over a couple of brush-fences!)
Porter did two tours of duty in South
Africa and ended the war a sergeant.
On return he joined the N.S.W. Mounted
Police and was with them close on 25
years, mostly in the bush.
It was during this time that Porter and
H. P. (“Duke”) Tritton first met —at
Nyngan, in 1908. Describing the incident
in Time Means Tucker “Duke” pro-
moted Porter to sergeant. He was, in
fact, a mounted constable ; but it was
intelligent anticipation on “Duke’s” part
—Porter ended as sergeant first-class.
Police-regulations prevented him from
joining-up in War I, but to make up for
that he cut 10 years off his age in War
II and was able to do his good bit with
one of the garrison-battalions.
Porter has written a book —members
of The Bulletin who have read the
manuscript think it very good. A record
of his early life, and titled When It Was
Another Day, it deals with the period
1885-1904; by neat coincidence ending
just where “Duke” Tritton’s story begins.

“Splint": By way of a follow-up to the note
here on the retirement of Victorian Water
Conservation engineer Ray McConchie, of the
old original Ist Div. Sigs., two other Mel-
burnians, also one-time originals of “Gordon’s
mob” (or “My bloody birds,” as Colonel
G. G. Gordon, D. 5.0., called them), must
have a ? place in these records to com-
memorate their own singular, if not unique,
record of mateship. They are Harry (“Dick”)
Ellis (born, February 13, 1895) and John T.
(“Tock” or sometimes “Jock”) Nicholls (born,
March 23, same year as Dick). Both went
to school together from Essendon; both went
into the Sigs. together under the pre-1914
compulsory-training scheme; they enlisted in
the Ist Div. Sigs. together on the outbreak
in 1914 (their numbers, 35 and 36); they
soldiered through together from then to the
end (Ist Contingent; Egypt; Anzac; France,
and the rest of it); were discharged together;
went together on the land for a while; even-
tually achieved the ambition of surely every
Digger who ever thirsted out beyond the
Pyramids, getting themselves a pub in partner-
ship. In War II they tried to enlist again
together, but together failed to put it over
the doc.; instead, they got themselves together
into the Army Inspection Service; they have
been in the Army Department ever since; and
now, the bloke with the hour-glass having
caught up with them, they are down for retire-
ment practically together. About that pub
of theirs, Dick recalls: “The morning after
we moved in half-a-dozen snoozers were knock-
ing at the door before opening-time. Jack
poked his head out the window and asked them
what they wanted. ‘A drink, of course, you
silly b !’ said a hoarse throat. ‘Well,’ says
Jack, ‘you can’t get one here.’ ‘Why the hell
not?’ ‘Because we bought this pub for our-
selves!’ Jack told him, and banged down the
window. You should have heard ’em!”

ABORIGINALITES
MEET JIM
[Introduced by “Aorque”]
The camp-cook, Jim Steady, a man of
parts, with odd flashes of originality
sparking unexpectedly, was a versatile
cove with an enduring capability in all
bush work. Horse-breaking, bronchoing,
ringing, yard-building, fencing, post-
cutting, camp-cooking and, at home,
doing the washing and ironing for his
wife and eight kids.
On the job he conveyed no impression
that he was working, but meals were
always on time, and plenty of food well
cooked. Not for Jim to coddle any
pernickety fellows such as well-nurtured
G.P.S. jackeroos or visiting silvertails
from overseas. “Hop in for your cut!”
was Jim’s style. From his swag —rolled
out under the overhanging tray of the
camp-truck—Jim waved his knife-hand
towards the fire:
“Stew and tea over
there!” Another
wave vertically to
the truck - tray:
“Bread and all the
doings up there, and
cover-up the but-
ter ! ” And a final
wave to the fire:
“Drop yer plates
and irons in the hot
water when you’ve
finished.”
Mow, that stew
was not the
ordinary watery
concoction of a lazy
cook. Jim’s stew
was a feed. A large
camp - oven holding
two whole shins of
beef, about 101 b. of
topside, with spuds
and onions, carrots,
beans and barley all
jostling at close
quarters in thick
gravy, and with
doughboys cooked
in the lip-smacking
mixture. That stew
was a beaut, with plenty for
“back-ups.”
Asked for the recipe for his stew Jim
told his feminine inquirer: “When a
man's been building feeds for twelve
years for a mob of kids you’ve got to
fill ’em up. No dainty frills and fancy
scones like Mrs. St. Gertrudis brings in
for the C.W.A. shivoos. Give ’em plenty
of thick stews, none of that shadow-
soup them Army cooks gave us.” (Jim
had spent three years cat-footing about
the New Guinea ridges, stalking sons of
Nippon from Kokoda onwards until the
wog got him.)
He further told the lady: “None of
that fancy stuff. Stick to stews, curries,
corned-beef and steak, when you can get
it, and doughboys or big lumps of
damper. Top ’em off with syrup.”
Ml7hen educational needs had pressed,
™ Jim had moved into “town,” where
he built a better-than-average hardwood
hut, comprised of two front rooms and,
behind them, running the full width, a
combined kitchen and dining-room.
Skillions had been added as the need
for more bedrooms was urged by the
rising family. At the rear, and detached,
was a large bough-shed which served as
a rumpus-room for the kids, a general
lounge and summer bedroom. Then
came a small plot of garden, well-fenced
off from the goat-yard and poultry-run.
During the building-operations he
made a thousand-gallon rainwater-tank,
the subject of much chiacking from the
local Brains Trust, who said, “Fancy
“I’ll put it this Way. There's nothing Wrong with you
that couldn't be cured by a miracle of medical science."
wasting money on a tank in this dump
where we never get more than six-inches
rain. The tank had been replenished
a f ev y times with rain, but rain or no
ra > n it was nearly always lull, lor Jim,
a t the end of the town pipeline, had
had his drouthy occasions, and whenever
the town supply was slightly better than
poor, Jim stuck the hose into the tank
an d topped-up. Hence the regulai supplv
°f snake-beans, pumpkins and lettuce,
w 'th a few cabbages after the grubs had
had their whack.
The bough-shed was the popular
meeting-place for Jim and his cobbers
who liked a game of poker or a spell
of dice-juggling. For Jim, although a
strict non-drinker, gambling was a
safety-valve, and it was also his religion.
The national pastime of heading-’em
had not been overlooked in his curricu-
lum. A discarded woman’s handbag
containing two packs of cards insepar-
ably travelled with Jim, who would
sooner leave his swag behind than “me
cards.” His dexterity in shuffling was
born of long experience and keen obser-
vation of his mates’ inattention to the
finer points of the game. As most of
the poker-sessions happened at night the
lack of fluorescent lighting was con-
spicuous, and —don’t think me imbiased
—I consider the flickering, bubbling
carbide-lamp was Jim’s chief ally in his
steady run of wins.
Jim’s backyard-farming included
clutches of ducklings, most of which,
on maturity, were sold to the pub for
Sunday-dinners, weddings and shivoos,
but always four of the best were retained
for special fattening to make the main
dish at the family Christmas-dinner, when
Jim did his family proud. Nothing but
the best.
With the camp in recess at Christmas,
when Old Sol made it too hot for horses
to go mustering bailies and stags, Jim
took himself off home to get ready for
the Big Feed. Waving from his jeep, he
shouted, “Look in and see us at Christ-
mas,” and drove off.
A couple of days before Santa Claus
a bore-pump played-up, and three of
us put in two of the hottest, sweatiest
days of the whole year getting at
a refractory foot-valve 300 ft. below,
and, of course, putting it down
again. Late on Christmas Eve, passing
through “town” on our way home (and
stepping on it), I remembered the “invite,”
so we swung around and pulled-up at
Jim’s place, where he stood in the door-
way waving us in with a broad grin.
Grimy and sweaty, we trooped in
through the front room to the kitchen-
diningroom. The room was gaily
decorated with streamers and gum-tips,
but what astonished us was the table
all set and ready for the Big Feed. As
Jim set some bottles on a side-table he
explained the early preparation: “Y’see,
it’s like this. The last two or three
Christmases in the morning about a
dozen ringers from the stations wearing
flash shirts and ties and several of me
town mates o£. v the poker-school called
around and stayed for dinner. Of course,
a man couldn’t very well tell them to
go off home, so the dinner had to be
divvied-up between me family of ten
and another dozen or so hungry-gutted
ringers, and the kids didn’t get much of
a go. So this year the missus and me
talked it over, and we decided to have




our Christmas-dinner at midnight and
get it over with. Well, here’s luck.
Happy Christmas!”

“Ikew”: Old Polly used to do the
men’s washing, the consideration usually
being tobacco. Coming to the home-
stead with a heap of clothes, Bill found
the old girl swimming in the nearby
lagoon with the other lubras. “I’ll leave
the clothes here, Polly,” he called with
averted eyes. “You bringum here,” she
screeched. “What wrong you? We not
whita women.”

“J.J.A.”: 1 have often noted in Oswald
Pryor’s joke-blocks dealing with life
among the Moonta Cousin Jacks that
"He said he felt well enough to leave."
his church congregations pack the front
pews and peter-out towards the back.
Everywhere I’ve been all over the world
congregations grab the back pews, late-
comers perforce taking the front ones.
Shortsighted ministers have been known
to think themselves becoming absent-
minded and getting there the wrong day
of the week when they don’t see the
congregation.

“Tabba”: “Kesem’s” mention of the
search for gold at Ukalunda (B.
4/11/’59) interested me. I had a drink
in the Queen's Beach Hotel, Bowen, with
three • prospectors who’d picked-up a
handful there in 1957 (the pub, inci-
dentally, was destroyed in this year’s big
cyclone). What surprised me was* the
carefree way the prospectors made
known how much gold they were carry-
ing. I handled a bar weighing 20oz.
and a jar holding 14oz. of dust. At
£l7 10s. per ounce that added-up to a
sum I'd be reluctant to show, on a dark
night, in the bar of a pub three miles out
of town.
Tn the grip of a persistent post-influenza
-*• virus-infection, and pondering mor-
bidly on some of our modern panaceas,
my thoughts turned to another wonder-
drug of a generation back. Out in the
N.S.W. far-west recently, we came upon
an old /post-and-rail fence (circa 1910)
preserved by Great-uncle Jim, and on it,
in large, faded blue lettering, was the
legend : “Eureka Lynament —Cures
Snake-Bite, Influenza, Pyrrhoea and
Typhoid!” In faded white on the next
panel was the injunction: “Prepare To
Meet Your God.” —“Talbingo.”

“Keima”: The just-elected 12-member
Goulburn (N.S.W.) City Council has an
Alderman C. A. Alderman and an
Alderman C. M. Alders. Alders was a
sitting councillor, but Alderman is new.
Might become tongue-twisting if both,
say, serve on the same committee, and
Mr. Mayor, thanking them for their
services, begins: “Aldermen Alderman
and Alders represented Council . . .”

“Kent”: Bearing quite a good crop
at present, an apricot-tree flourishes out-
side a block of offices at No. 3 York
Street, Sydney. On the opposite side of
the city, in Forbes Street, an evergreen
tree has for years been leaning out into
the light, its roots embedded in the
front-veranda foundations.

“8.A.K.”: All the authorities I’ve con-
sulted give “Parramatta” as being
for “place of eels,” “many
eels” or “place where eels sit down,”
so it was a bit of a facer to read that
Jilliby is aboriginal for “Plenty of eels.”
Considering that Jilliby is no more than
50 miles from Parramatta as the black-
fellow walked it is hard to believe that
so complete a change in the lingo could
have taken place. Unless aboriginal was
a very accommodating language, it would
seem that some philologist has blundered.
But a prominent petrol-firm evidently
doesn’t think so. In conjunction with
a fishingline-manufacturer, and under the
auspices of Wycng (N.S.W.) Rotary, it
is sponsoring an eel-fishing contest at
Jilliby on January 16. Ten eels are to
be caught in the creek, tattooed, and
released. The biggest will be worth £lOO
to the man who recaptures him, with an
additional £25 if he is caught on a line
sold by the sponsoring firm. Proceeds
will go to local Scouts and Guides. My
sympathy goes out in advance to the
bloke who has to hold the eels for
tattooing.

“Arafura”: Due for the scrap-heap
soon is the Kimberley, known on the
W.A. coast for 33 years as the Koolinda.
Under her new name she has been a
cattle-boat on the Darwin-Hong Kong
run, and also made several trips to
Brisbane for a cattle-exporting firm. The
former passenger-ship was converted to
take up to 1200 head of cattle. On her
last voyage she left Darwin with 46
buffaloes and 1000 Territory cattle. As
the Koolinda she made 399 trips on the
W.A. coast for her owners, W.A. State
Shipping Service. Built in Glasgow in
1926, her marine certificate has now
expired. She was affectionately regarded
by Nor’-westers, and weathered many a
cockeyed-bob during her years between
Fremantle, Carnarvon, Broome, Derby
and other nor’-west ports. -

“A.M.”: In our (Victorian) town the
most glamorous shops are butchers’-
shops One new shop sports pink walls
and blue doors and blue laminex counter.
Another has a green-and-yellow color
scheme: the windows decorated with
bowls of flowers. The old sheep's still
dressed-up as lamb, there, too.

“M.L.M.”: That red-setter named
Dolf on The Bulletin cover (9 /12/’59)
reminded me of my own pre-war
Dollfuss, so-called when Hitler began his
strutting over Europe. My Dollfuss was
a Scottie, and he derived his name from
a piece of London “Punch” verse of that
time which fan something like this:
I had a little bow-wow
And, oh, it is a shame,
1 never, never now-wow
May call him by his name.
They had a party pow-wow
And brought the matter up.
Was ever such a row-wow
About a little pup!
’Twas when I named my bow-wow
My Dollfuss best of hounds;
I know not why nor how-wow
They fined me FORTY POUNDS!
Our pup and the ill-fated Dr. Dollfuss
became so completely identified that
when I read out the news to the family
that Dollfuss had been murdered by the
Nazis my small daughter replied (not
grasping what I said). “No they haven’t,
he’s under the table.” Whereupon Doll-
fuss dog came out and obligingly showed
himself.


The whiskery - faced little pooch,
looking suspiciously like a Scor-
field model, gets a skin-irritation, and
his resultant visits to the vet., with
subsequent clipping and bathing and
creaming, must give him a fair bit of
relief, because he reckons the vet. is a
pretty good bloke. The vet., picking-up
his mail from his post-office box, felt
a touch on his leg, and looked down
into the upturned, grinning dial of
Whiskers. An affable bloke, with a good
kennel-side manner, he passed the time
of day and suggested that pooch go
home. Whiskers responded by extending
the grin and trotting to the kerb, looking
back to see if his medical adviser was
coming. Then he carefully inspected
each parked car till he found the one
he usually travelled to hospital in. With
the grin still expanding, he waited for
the vet. to open the door for him to
bounce in. That’s how Mrs. Vet. came
to ring the little chap's owners to tell
them he had made his own appointment,
and was now having a week of hospital-
treatment, which, since it own
suggestion, was on the house. —“Gunne.”

“Benbow”: The native word rano,
meaning water, and according to
“Sanasi” (B. 9/12//59) and other
authorities general throughout the Pacific,
seems to bear an affinity with ran, which
meant, when I was in the Gilbert
Islands 30 years ago, water. I always
imagined this word to be a corruption
of the English word “rain,” particularly
considering the difficulty one meets in an
alphabet having only 17 letters ; how-
ever, the actual meaning could be a little
more fluid than just water. Mothers’
milk such as Gilbert Island babies were
fed on was known as te ran I mama.
* * * *
“G.N.W.”: Tell “5 G.R.” (B. 9/12/’59)
that he must be failed in Urdu. Though
a “pukka rasta” could well be a “metalled
road” it would be only because “pukka”
means, literally, “after the best manner,”
not “metalled.” Similarly, a “pukka
sahib” is, in English, “a Sir of the best
type,” or, in Australese “a good sort of
a so-and-so.” “Decco” doesn’t mean
“Let’s have a look,” but is the impera-
tive form of the verb “dekhna” (to see).
“Decco” can only, therefore, stand alone
as an order to the hearer to see (some-
thing).
* * * *
“Jo”: “Keima” (B. 11/11 /’59) had
some fun with the pronunciation of
Bow Bowing Creek. I would suggest
that “Keima” listen to radio-announcers
reading the rainfalls. Goomeri (Goo-
Mary) becomes “Goo Mar Eye” or “Goo
Mar-ie” and so on. Jumpinpin (always
with a slight accent on the first syllable)
suddenly with the advent of southern
sun-seekers to the Gold Coast has be-
come Jum Pin Pin (heavy and equal
accent on the last two syllables). Taroom
(equal accent) also suffers, also U-8080.

“Emel”: A cockatoo which for 50
years had been in the possession of a
Natimuk (Vic.) family surprised its
owners by going broody and burrowing
a hole in the ground. Three weeks after
being given a couple of hen-eggs to sit
on Cocky brought out a chicken. “He”
now struts around with chest stuck out
like a pouter-pigeon.
“Spinifex”: When I met him on the
road he was toting an empty bridle and
looking disconsolate. “You shee um my
horse?” he asked. “I looshem larsh-en-
ni.” “What’s he like?” I asked. “Him
pie-baw horse,” he replied rapidly, as
though he’d been through the story many
times. “Not wellee big. Gotta fourna-
jeenanna-aye si-way near see-older,
George Orbley blan’. Goota toonabeena-
see off see-older. Gotta hoboo-chain
longa neck. New bell. New sall-stlap,
too. You shee ’um?” I told Ah Sam
I hadn’t, but promised to keep a look-
out for the piebald pony with the hobble-
chain round its neck, and the new bell
and saddle-strap, too ; and to note
especially if the animal was branded
4GA—with the A sideways (George
Aubrey’s brand) on the near-shoulder,
and 2BC on the off-shoulder. I found
him at the next gate.
* * * *
“Perseverando”: You’ve had a cross-
cut-saw “shiver” when working it single-
handed? Of course! Well, you needn’t.
Simply tie one end of a 3ft. length of
bicycle-tubing to a crowbar driven firmly
into the ground about 6ft. from the log.
The other end of the tubing is tied to
the other end of the saw. Keep the
purchase on the bar a little lower than
the bite on the log. When halfway
through, it will feel as if you have a mate
on the other end.

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Legislative Council-
lors expressed concern in Moresby at
the sharp increase of the Rabaul area’s
importation of alcoholic liquors.
Administration - gazetted regulations
applying to the whole of New Britain
and New Ireland now require the record-
ing of names and addresses of all buyers
of liquor, except those getting less than
two gallons of beer or stout, or drinking
liquor on licensed premises. The
licensees have to make the records at
the time of every sale, and they’re not
exactly pleased about it.
PAPAITI
Papaiti, my little stream, will they make
you flow underground,
Taking your dimpled surface and your
fluid limbs
Into a straitjacket of grey concrete ?
Will they rule
Razor-cut lines where your sweet
meanderings
Looped the meadow, where you ran,
shingle and shallow,
Under the hanging willow, past the fox-
gloves,
Purple and pink and white, past the
broom,
Yellow as summer, under the kissing
gorse —
Will they take you, my small Persephone,
Out of the cradled arms of your Earth
Mother ,
Into the Underworld, into Hell, into
Hades ?
In the black tunnel, youth is gone forever,
Hope dies at the mouth, and apathy,
another death,
Stills the laughter, stills the leaping,
Papaiti.
Well we know that all our streams shall
merge at death —
We that were many, in the end shall be
, as one.
But if you run at last, my buried stream-
let,
Out of the tunnel to the boundless sea,
You will be free to know once more the
sunshine,
Free to wander; though no more your-
self, Papaiti.
And when l come, walking over your
hollow memory,
I shall not know you ; it will not be the
same.

THE OUTLOOK FOR 1960
'T'hf. most obvious economic
. change facing Australia in
196Q —in the midst of a period
of continuing industrial ex-
pansion—is the prospect of a
greater rate of inflation arising
principally from higher Arbi-
tration Court wages.
Adding the June, 1959, 155.-
a-week increase in the Federal
basic wage onto recent in-
creases in margins, the rise in
some Federal awards could be
as high as 10 p.c.
Some industries were
already paying above the 1956
margins, and other industries
under State awards had pre-
ceded those under Federal
awards in lifting wages. So,
overall, the rise in rates in
respect of the 1959-60 financial
year is unlikely to be as high
as 10 p.c. But even if it
averages 5 p.c. it is away
ahead of our present rate of
growing productivity, and
increased costs tend to snow-
ball around higher wages.
This means that members of
the community other than
wage-earners must go with less,
or that inflation will acceler-
ate its climb during 1960.
If the proprietary side of
industry is forced to absorb
rising wage-costs without rais-
ing selling-prices, then profits
of industry will suffer, especi-
ally as competing imports will
be admitted more readily
under the present liberalised
quotas.
On the other hand, if
increased costs are passed on
to the consumer, then there
will be the old inflationary
spiral again, with prices chasing
costs, and paper-money values
again soaring.
Easier importing won’t last
long if overseas funds start
to dry-up through exports fail-
ing because of high internal
costs.
As the picture appears
close-up, Australia looks * like
being odd-man-out in this
inflationary boost in 1960. The
U.S.A. is taking a stand against
inflation by attempting to bal-
ance the Federal Budget and
to defeat the “wage-cost push.”
Many anti-inflationary factors,
including overproduction and
a trade deficit, are tending to
check the cost-price spiral in
the U.S.A.
In the United Kingdom the
retail-price index for October,
1959, was very slightly below
that for October, 1958. This
was partly the . result of
purchase-tax reductions; but
the main reason was because
wage-rates and earnings have
been rising much more moder-
ately than at any time since
World War 11.
In Australia recent wage-
rises are very ill-timed, as the
“prosperity-loading” of 1950
turned-out to be. The slight
recovery in our exporfivalues
recently is by no means secure,
and manufacturing industry is
still backward by overseas
standards.
Australia’s population is
increasing at a brisk rate, and
it has great development pro-
jects in hand, but they will
not be assisted by cost-infla-
tion. High costs discourage
investment by Australians as
well as by overseas investors:
they impose disturbing and
unequal burdens on different
sections of the public, and they
make it difficult for us to
obtain overseas materials and
machinery essential to our
development. .
Though inflation may,
through its side-effects, create
an atmosphere of spurious
market buoyancy during 1960,
it is at all times to be dis-
trusted. If it shows signs of
roaring upward again it may
attract unpleasant but neces-
sary governmental and financial
counter-measures that may hit
the market more severely than
anything else.
If Australia is the odd-man-
out indeed in 1960, the strain
on the exchange-rate could
become almost unbearable.
SHAREMARKET PROSPECT
UTHE sharemarket in 1960
■*- will be subject to the effects
of a more severe “wage-push” in
the costs of industry, and some
industries, facing increased
overseas competition and local
over-capacity already, may not
be able to pass-on increased
costs, with the result that their
profits will shrink.
A factor in our expansion
over the past three years has
been the comparative stability
of wages. We are now losing
that stability.
“Selectivity” in choosing
investments is therefore more
essential than ever, even though
the economy is likely to remain
generally expansive, and par-
ticular companies may make
exceptionally good profits.
If inflation gets noticeably
under way again there may
be a rush on shares represen-
ting the stronger industrial
equities in order to “hedge”
against inflation and “capital
erosion.” But Government
authorities may take counter-
measures against any sign of
runaway inflation, and such
measures, squeezing against in-
flationary increases in wages
that are already an accom-
plished fact, could pinch profit-
earning severely.
Government counter-moves
could also prick sharemarket
buoyancy, as in 1951-52.
As usual, a great deal will
depend on the course of over-
seas markets for raw materials,
particularly those which Aus-
tralia exports. No boom in
these products appears probable
on present statistics, but an
improvement on 1959 seems
generally likely, especially if
the U.S. steel strike comes to a
definite close.
Upon the way the Australian-
inflationary problem is handled
in 1960 will partly depend how
overseas capital will flow into
the country during the year.
A comparatively stable eco-
nomy would continue to attract
capital. Excessive inflation
would produce a threat to the
exchange-rate, especially in
view of the stabilising trend
of costs and prices overseas.

UT27C
G.M.-H. Prefs.
A pparently General Motors-
Holden’s, or at least its
U.S. parent, made a decision to
put-up with one big public-
relations headache this year
rather than have a recurring
headache every year that its
accounts are published.
In offering 355. each through
a new subsidiary for the
561,600 £1 6 p.c. cum. prefs.
in General Motors-Hoiden’s,
Ltd., the American parent may
acquire all the shares in the
Australian Lfolden-producing
concern, and then would not
be obliged to publish accounts
of Australian operations each
year.
The Bolte Government in
Victoria has now indicated that
it will introduce legislation next
March to force all subsidiary
proprietary companies to pro-
duce (and presumably file with
the Registrar of Companies)
full and detailed accounts. This,
it would seem, would apply to
subsidiaries of overseas oil-
companies as well as to off-
shoots of overseas motor-car
manufacturers other than
General Motors.
The Victorian Government is
perfectly at liberty to intro-
duce such legislation, just as
General Motors is at liberty
to make whatever financial deal
it can with Australian share-
holders.
The high G.M.-H. profits
earned (£15.3 million last year)
have provoked criticism each
time fresh accounts have been
issued, mainly on the score
that there is no Australian in-
vestor participation in the
concern.
Like other large U.S. com-
panies, General Motors does
not encourage local investor-
partnership in its overseas
operations, and it follows
National Dairy (of Kraft
Cheese memory) in seeking to
buy-out a minority interest,
even where it is not an equity-
share interest.
There has been a similar
trend by other U.S. com-
panies in the U.K., where the
minority interest in British
Timken, for example, was
taken over.
General Motors has no
doubt considered the whole
matter seriously from a public-
relations angle and has decided
deliberately on its present
course. Most people, includ-
ing that well-known U.S.
financier Bernard Baruch, and
the present U.S. Ambassador to
Australia, William J. Sebald,
believe that U.S. overseas direct
investment should be made in
partnership with the nationals
of the country concerned.
Apart from this matter of
policy in regard to international
investment - partnership, from
the economic point of view
Australia has gained much
from the advent of the Holden
car, even if it would gain more
if an investment-partnership
were arranged. If General
Motors-Holden’s seems to be
making a lot of money, it is up
to its competitors to shake
themselves up and cut more
competitively into the market.
Sir Leonard Lord, of the
B.M.C. group, in particular
might pay a lot more attention
to what the A ustralians
prefer in the way of a motor-
car, even as between, say, the
Morris and the Austin.
Burdens on Exports
"PRODUCTION - costs in Aus-
tralia are only one of a
number of factors which
burden Australian exports. The
Australian Industries’ De-
velopment Association also
lists the Australian payroll-
tax, the only one of its kind
in the world ; delays of up to
a year in Tariff Board reports
which damage an export com-
pany’s bread-and-butter home
market; and inadequate de-
preciation allowances. The
association also cites the West
German Government’s tax-
credits to manufacturers for
valuable exports.
Oil from Coal
[From “Old o|>en<‘ut”l
nPHERE is a curious anomalous
position in the world to-
day when great Powers with
abundant coal resources are
abandoning good mines as un-
profitable and without future,
while hitherto backward-
regarded countries, mixed-
blood and colored republics are
spending millions to convert
their not-so-rich coal into
petrol, oils and petrochemicals.
The reason given in both
cases is that this is now the
day and age of liquid fuels and
hydrocarbon chemicals. Coal
in the raw is out.
The Governments of
countries which have built-up
an industrial economy on over-
seas crude oil and its deriva-
tives are now looking rather
closely at their coal resources,
This attitude is, no doubt,
engendered by three causes,
Firstly there is a realisation of
the unpredictability of the
natural reserves of crude
petroleum ; secondly, the un-
pleasantly acquired know-
ledge that the greatest oil-pro-
ducing areas are controlled by
States not over-friendly to the
British Commonwealth and
other free nations; and,
thirdly, a belated appreciation
that in this era of chemical
syntheses and plastics, coal of
any grade is a valuable com-
modity.
Full-scale production - pro-
jects in various continents hav«
demonstrated the feasibility of
treating, by hydrogenation pro-
cesses, low-grade coals both
sub-bituminous and lignitic, to
produce high-octane petrols as
well as the complete range of
petro- and hydrocarbon-
chemicals, elements, com-
pounds, oxides and miscel-
laneous items totalling some

It has been found that the
reactivity of coals to hydro-
genation is near enough to in-
versely proportional to the
carbon content. High carbon-
content coals do not readily
liquefy. The best treatment for
top-grade bituminous coal is
to establish consumer-utilities
near the site i.e., firing
thermal-power stations, carbon-
isation for gas and coke pro-
duction, with high-pressure
mains reticulating to industrial
and community centres. The
tar residues can then be con-
verted to oil in the same plant
treating raw coal of a lower

The difference between coal
and oil is one of hydrogen,
Petroleum is of high hydrogen-
content but low in oxygen and
nitrogen. The process to con-
vert’coal to oil is one of hydro-
genation in which a finely
ground coal is reduced to a
liquid equal to a natural crude-
oil. The crude is then passed
through a refinery for produc-
tion of petrol and by-products,

cessful plant yet installed is
the South African project to
which previous mention was
made in B. 19/2/’5B. It is
located at Sasolburg near
Johannesburg, in the Northern
Free State of the Union. The
project was originated by a
public company, the South
African Gas, Coal and Oil
Co., Ltd. The plant was
designed by the Kellogg Cor-
poration of U.S.A. and in-
stalled by the same firm.
The treatment-plant is near
a vast deposit of sub-bitu-
minous coal previously unsale-
able in profitable quantities as
coal for normal combustion.
The maximum capacity of the
hydrogenation and refinery
units is 66-million imp. gallons
of petrol (to 92-octane) per
year. The coal-deposit is
worked by opencast methods,
and is completely mechanised.
The plant reached the break-
even point at 36-million-
gallons-yearly output, and
revenue from sales is now at
the rate of £A7y million a year.
The petrochemical plant cannot
keep up with the demand for
by-products covering a most
extensive range. The costs to
the end of April, 1959,
for the Sasolburg project are
as follows:
£A.
Coal - winning and
handling plant .. 2,500,000
Plant - site preparation,
civil works and
buildings .. .. .. 4.000,000
Hydrogenation (liquid-
phase) plant and
associated units .. 7,000,000
Refinery (vapor - phase)
and hydrocarbon
chemical plant .. 15,500,000
Modern town, com-
munications and
amenities 11,000,000
Development charges .. 6,000,000
This total cost of £A46
million is amortised over a
15-year period. Proved coal
resources give a 55-year life
at a-million-ton-a-year con-
sumption, but the basin is
estimated to hold a further
300-million tons. It requires
five tons of coal to produce one
ton of petrol and one ton of
saleable by-products. These
products of the “middle” oils
are proving of sufficient value
to warrant some undertakings
in Europe treating coal for the
by-products only.
Recent inquiries show that
the plant is operating most
satisfactorily at present on a
yearly output of 40-million
gallons, while the coal-beds
are being extended and de-
veloped. Full production to the
installed capacity is planned
for the end of this year.
There are 69 plants through-
out the world now treating coal
for oil and petrochemicals. The
minimum capacity for a suc-
cessful project is 150,000 tons
output per year. This was
found to be the case by the
Imperial Chemical Industries
when their oil-from-coal hydro-
genation-plant was established
at Billingham, England. Origi-
nally designed for 100,000-tons
output of petrol, the company
was not altogether pleased with
the economics of the project.
The plant was extended to
produce 150,000 tons by treat-
ing 100,000 tons of coal-tar
produced in gasworks, coke-
ovens and other carbonisation-
units. The demand for the
chemical by-products has since
made the plant a very profitable
undertaking.
The Sasolburg project is,
however, considered an ideal
pattern for similar ventures.
In giving consideration to
any major project these days
involving huge expenditures
there are two factors to bear
in mind! The first is that the
population of the world will
have doubled in 41 years from
now, and, secondly, liquid-
fuel requirements will double
in the next 10 years.

THE YEAR IN THEATRE
To the reviewer rummaging
through heaps of pro-
grammes and clippings in an
effort to assess the year’s theatre
in Sydney, Australian Theatre
Year, 1959/60 (F.P. Publica-
tions, 155.), with its clear-plastic
jacket and attractively colored
cover-picture of a scene from
“The Piccadilly Bushman,” is
a welcome sight indeed.
Besides its many clear and
well-displayed photographs of
professional and amateur pro-
ductions from all States, and its
reprints of five of Molnar’s
atmospheric drawings and
comments on recent stagings
at the Sydney Elizabethan, it
has 20-odd short articles on
live topics, many of them by
people of high theatrical stand-
ing.
Hugh Hunt outlines his five
years as executive director of
the Australian Elizabethan
Theatre Trust and his efforts
to establish resident stock-
companies through which local
actors and playwrights could
“find their own particular
approach to style” ; John Mc-
Callum is warm about Aus-
tralian audiences and hopeful
about a revival of Australian
theatre; Lindsey Browne,
drama critic of the “Sydney
Morning Herald,” sympatheti-
cally examines the tendency of
Australian playwrights to draw
their material from “low” life,
and ventures some provocative
comments on “The Piccadilly
Bushman” ; Hayes Gordon
explains the techniques behind
his admirable theatre-in-the-
round ; Colin Ballantyne tells
what it takes to produce
a producer; playwright Alan
Seymour runs an eye over the
present state of TV-drama
production and its critics;
Dinah Shearing writes on
acting, Peter Scriven on
puppetry, Beth Dean on
dancing, and Paul Kathner on
stage-designing.
Thus the book presents many
angles of approach to the
present theatrical scene, many
of them thoughtful, construc-
tive and critical. . The total
impression created is of a
conscious all-round attempt to
assert the value of theatre in
a period of cheap mass-enter-
tainment —an impression which
tallies well with the Sydney
scene.
It is to be hoped that the
articles on activities in other
"Youd better step on it. This dam ’ mullet is
getting a bit high!"
States —all of which seem fair
to the Sydney eye —strike a
better balance than the one by
Norman McVicker on theatre in
N.S.W.
McVicker disposes of the
Trust Players’ season (March-
July at the Elizabethan) by
remarking that the company
was chiefly composed of
established players and pro-
duced no new names. This is
hardly fair. The Trust Players
were intended to be a stock-
company of the highest avail-
able standard. The Trust could
hardly be expected to take risks
in the mater of actors in what
was, after all, something of a
trial-season.
Moreover, on the production
side the Trust took as many
risks as could be expected and
stuck admirably to its stated
policy of staging new Aus-
tralian plays as well as quality
plays from abroad. If neither
of the two Australian plays
presented Peter Kenna’s
“Slaughter of Saint Teresa’s
Day” and Anthony Coburn’s
“The Bastard Country”—was
successful, the Trust could
hardly be blamed for that.
Both plays were very stage-
worthy, and it is most unlikely
that two better ones could have
been found.
In fact, the Trust Players'
season was the event of the
year in Sydney, and two of its
productions “Long Day’s
Journey into Night” and
“Julius Caesar”—were artistic
successes of a very high order.
McVicker further states that
“as in the past, the real enter-
prise in Sydney theatre came
from its three little-theatres.”
His later statement that “1959
has been a year of marking-
time in the little-theatres” gives
a iruer impression
The three little-theatres he
refers to are the Independent,
the Genesians and his own
Pocket Playhouse. These were
competent and pleasing enough
in their own ways and as far
as they chose to go; but
except for the Independent’s
fine production of Arthur
Miller’s “A View from the
Bridge,” none of them ven-
tured far outside the conven-
tional in their choice of plays
or methods. They were out-
stripped in enterprise, and
often in skill, by a company
which McVicker completely
overlooks —the Sydney Uni-
versity Dramatic Society.
Under its sensitive producer
Pamela Trethowan, S.U.D.S.
was consistently bdld in its
choice of plays and stimulating
in its treatment of them. Its
productions of Beckett’s “End-
game,” Anouilh’s “Waltz of the
Toreadors” and lonesco’s “The
Bald Prima Donna” (triple
award-winner in the British
Drama League’s annual festival
of one-acters) —all plays which
offer an exciting challenge to
TV and the films —were peaks
in Sydney’s little-theatre year.
The tour of John Alden’s
J.C.W. Shakspearian Com-
pany also needs more comment
than it gets. Although this com-
pany was apparently a financial
failure, especially in Mel-
bourne, and did not consistently
reach an artistic standard
worthy of a resident profes-
sional company, it was some-
thing of an event in three
States, notably for the per-
formances it yielded from
visiting Scottish actor John
Laurie in “Winter’s Tale,”
“The Merchant” and “Lear.”
Even an unsuccessful venture
of this kind deserves analysis.
The comprehensive lists of
professional productions at the
back of the book contain some
pleasant reminders of the year s
visiting artists: Danny Kaye’s
glittering comedy at the Empire
and Joyce Grenfell’s quiet
comedy at the Phillip Street;
Cilli Wang’s intricately crea-
tive miming at the Royal ; Shirl
Conway’s expert comedy in
“Auntie Marne” and Googie
Withers’s polish in “Roar Like
a Dove” at the same theatre ;
Moira Lister’s storytelling:
sentiment at Anzac House ; the
spirited folk-dancing of the


Yugoslav Kolo Dancers, and,
above all, the great pyrotech-
nics of the Bolshoi Ballet
Ensemble at the Elizabethan.

Stage and Music
Trust Players in Brisbane
Apparently unable to grace
this opera-loving city with an
“Otello” or a “Fidelio” out of
cold-storage for its Centenary
year, the Elizabethan Theatre
Trust made partial amends by
sending its very good team of
players to present three plays
in repertory style—Shaw’s
“Man and Superman,”
Anthony Coburn’s “Fire on
the Wind” (formerly titled
“The Bastard Country”), and
O’Neill’s “Long Day’s Journey
into Night.”
The Shaw piece was emascu-
lated without the Hell scene,
and, despite West End theatre-
practice, it should not be played
in this truncated form. If it
is good enough for Bayreuth
audiences to take six hours of
“Parsifal” on the hardest seats
in the world simply because
Wagner wrote just that much,
surely we can do the same for
Shaw's masterpiece.
Since the genuine success of
“The Doll” and the contro-
versial success of “The Shift-
ing Heart,” a new Australian
play in this season was a
must. “Fire on the Wind” falls
about halfway between its
predecessors. Better than “The
Shifting Heart” because less
indebted to theatre stockpot
(though not, of course, free
from it), this play is weak in
that many of its characters were
typed figures, or not clearly
seen.
Neva Carr Glyn supplied
the extra quality that kept her
barmaid in focus; but the
central characters, father and
daughter, were not believable
as written or presented ; nor
did the overall symbol of the
fire amount to anything it
was a giant squib, neither
advancing the action nor epi-
tomising it. Coburn has given
too much. Put-out his fire,
reduce the madness of the
father, and the whole play
might burn even brighter.
What Coburn’s fire failed to
be Eugene O’Neill’s fog was.
How beautifully it became a
working symbol in “Long
Day’s Journey Into Night”! It
enfolded action and character
alike. A pity that on the pro-
duction side the presence of
the fog could not be felt more.
What an opera-producer could
have done with it! Nor was
the upstairs pacing of the
mother anywhere near as
terrible as it could have been.
It could have hammered its
loneliness into our minds,
which by that time were willing
and waiting to receive its
terror.
The O’Neill play a pro-
gramming afterthought when
apparently bookings for the
other plays were not up to the
mark—proved to be by far the
Trust’s greatest achievement in
Brisbane since “The Magic
Flute” some years ago. It is
unfair to contrast Coburn’s
“This is Sir Martingale Harwick, the eminent
brain specialist .”
play with this masterpiece from
the height of O’Neill’s powers,
yet it is worth noting that in
the O’Neill piece, where
almost nothing happens for
three-and-a-half hours, there
is more authentic theatre ten-
sion than in a whole hillside
set alight, plus a madman, a
knifed dog and a mistress.
Perhaps O’Neill’s suffers
by comparison with more
“modern” American writing on
the drug-addict theme. It has
been said often enough that
O’Neill can’t properly manage
dialogue; but he knew that
the heart had its truth, and
this he set down, even if its
framework creaked, even if he
overwrote in the way Whit-
man overwrote, and he yet
remains a true and great poet.
This, wordy play brought
from Dinah Shearing a per-
formance of outstanding
quality. One felt the painfuh
movements of this ageing,
drugged woman; her hands
.moved with difficulty, her back
had all the stiffness of pride
linking its every joint. One
goes back a very long way to
find a comparable perform-
ance.
If Miss Shearing proved to
be the great actress of the
company, Frank Waters proved
to be its disappointment. In
O’Neill’s play one simply could
not believe his own words
that he was once praised by
Edwin Booth for his Shaks-
pearian tragic roles. This man
could not have been lago, Mac-
beth and Lear. Frederic March,
on the New York stage, was
able to suggest this, and so
much of the little sympathy we
have for the father should stem
from his fallen greatness.
Technically, Waters was not
comparable to Miss Shearing.
His hand-movements were not
those of his character but of
himself, and he showed little
skill in the use of voice. Ron
Haddrick’s quality of per-
formance was in sharp con-
trast in both the Shaw play
and O’Neill’s when the two
men were run together.
Neil Fitzpatrick’s work in
the three plays seems difficult
to assess. The Shaw piece did
not fit him as well as did
O’Neill’s, in which he seemed
to understand the autobio-
graphical role much more
clearly; or perhaps, if it is not
sacrilege to say so, O’Neill is
the better playwright if both
heart and mind are to be fed
on the same fare.
One hopes that this company
will become a regular visitor
to Brisbane.

Revue
Sydney Independent has put
on a revue for Christmas.
Ahem.
Well, it is the season of
goodwill. This is certainly
willing ; and even, if you take
the best of it, quite good in
spots.
Jane Williams is distinctly
funny in a sketch about a
beauty-parlor; Arnold Smith
sings a pleasing bit of rock-
and-roll in “Too Many
Women” ; the skit on the music
for the Elizabethan Theatre’s
“Julius Caesar,” if nothing else,
is amusing in “Independent
Observer” ; “Paddle Popsies,”
a sketch of sissy lifesavers in
oldfashioned costumes, is
lively; “Channel Choppers,”
picking-up bits from different
TV-programmes to make a
faintly rude story, is like the
game of “Consequences”;
Judith Champ, John Rickard
and Norman Mann do very
well in “Breakfast with
Bess,” in which Heinrich
Voss, the author of Patrick
White and other novels,
is invited to a radio breakfast-
session ; “Up the Red Flag,”
though there is no good
reason why the warders should
be Cockneys, finds readymade
humor in the escapes from
Long Bay ; and “Ring a Ling
High,” though it needs a
couple more stanzas to explain
why the situation should be
tragic, is quite a striking ballad
about Ned Kelly.
So, there are moments.
But if you take the worst of
it —the shock of the opening
chorus, in which not one word
is distinguishable; the dismal
compering ; the awful spectacle
of nice young ladies from the
North Shore skipping about in
various mild degrees of undress
and obviously longing to get
their clothes on again ; the
forced humor and unnatural
speaking-voices; the earnest
but lugubrious bits of lowlife ;
the sketches, like the one on
the supermarket, that verge on
being something and need re-
writing, and the sketches, like
the one on the three men from
the moon, that just aren’t any-
thing at all —why then, even in
the season of goodwill, there
are times when one reflects that
this is a great, big, wicked,

Carols
It was very pleasant, three
days before Christmas Day,
to drop-in at St. James’
Church in Sydney’s King Street
for a programme of “Christ-
mas Music”; 12 carols and a
Bach cantata.
A fine old church, some fine
old carols; and the Sydney
University Graduates’ Choir,
under conductor G. Faunce
Allman, brought dignity and,
notably in very soft passages,
clarity of enunciation to its
unaccompanied work. The
choir sang “Ding Dong,
Merrily On High” v/ith gusty
spirit; investigated, after the
unisonal “Sussex Carol”
(organ part initially mis-
handled), the silken mystery of
the German piece “O Little
One,” arranged by Bach (here
the balance was marred by a
sleepy approach from the
sopranos); and then gave us
Dora Greenwell’s adaptation
of a crisp 16th-century Dutch
melody, “If Ye Would Hear.”
The cantata “Sing We the
Birth” seemed just out of the
choir’s reach. It might have
been better if organist Mar-
garet Cheng had kept a more
appropriate tempo , and varied
her tone-colors more.
Baritone soloist David
Branagan was efficient rather
than inspired, even in the aria
“We Mortals,” where Bach’s
treatment of the word “joyous”
has all the floridity of Italian
bel canto writing. The trio
section is interesting, for it
has a fixed song by altos
against soprano-tenor counter-
point—each division singing
different words.
Of the remaining eight
carols, the soft breathing of
the organ and a rocking tempo
in “The Snow Lies Thick”
caught the ear; so did the
Pearsall arrangement of “In
Dulci Jubilo.” In this the
conductor started with a beat
just too fast for comfort, but
fortunately the prancing effect
disappeared in the second
verse. Two departures from
the score: the trio middle
section was given to full voice-
distribution ; and there was an
unnecessary rallentando at the
second entry of the words “Oh,
that we were there” ; and right
at the end the tenors started
their A-to-C ascent too early.
In Peter Cornelius’s fine
carol “The Kings” soloist
David Branagan seemed too
matter-of-fact; “The Coventry
Carol,” though, was beauti-
fully sung, and “Puer Nobis”
went with a bang.

For Children
“Smugglers Beware”
Written by Eleanor Wit-
combe and elegantly produced
by Robin Lovejoy at the Eliza-
bethan Theatre (Sydney),
“Smugglers Beware” is a very
pleasant musical play for
children, set in early Sydney—
the movement towards a native
Australian drama grows and
spreads in all directions, and
takes an additional step in this
play with the couple of old
bush songs, including “Click
Go the Shears,” in the musical
department.
The plot alleges that in the
mid of night the two
scoundrels Croaker (Ron
Haddrick) and Herbert Huggle
(Des Rolfe), aided by a rather
simple little man named
Rummy (Guy Le Claire), roll
smuggled kegs of rum into the
secret passage of an inn—and
what more could you want for
Christmas? All would be well
if the rum, plus villains and
hero, did not somehow get
mixed-up with the hatboxes of
the charming young seamstress
(Patricia Conolly) who lives
next-door.
Neva Carr Glyn and Dinah
Shearing, cousins (thrice re-
moved) to the ferocious
Colonel of the Rum Corps,
make an excellent pair of
toadies or vixens as the case
requires; William, who is
sometimes Brian Smith and
sometimes Donald Kennedy,
is on both occasions a real
small boy instead of the usual
actress dressed-up in wolf’s
clothing; and Ethel Gabriel
and Neil Fitzpatrick are other
notable additions to the enter-
tainment.
The music, though it needs
more than a piano to do it
justice, is catchy. The whole
thing is rather like a bit of
Gilbert-and-Sullivan with an
Australian setting.

“Ride on a Broomstick”
An exquisite little piece,
written by three Australians,
Eleanor Witcombe, Dot Men-

Clever lighting and subtle
colors re-create that medieval
land of magic where everything
is possible, and the tricky wit,
though it might sometimes
escape the childish understand-
ing, is a delight to parents and
aunts.
Gordon Chater, as the un-
happy dragon, turns a twist
on the Tinker Bell theme when
he appeals to the audience to
say they love him (nobody
does), and Sheila Bradley is
splendid as the wicked but
inefficient witch. At the

“They Came to Cordura”
Director Robert Rossen
splashes his dramatic highlights
on a big canvas in this pene-
trating analysis of what can
make a man, in the heat of
battle and out of it, either a
hero or a coward.
In the Mexican War of
1916, cavalry-captain Gary
Cooper is overprudent in the
initial blooding of his unit and
is branded a coward. His
bitter superiors set him an
ironical assignment: to select
in a later action men deserving
of high honors for bravery.
Having done this he has to lead
the men, along with a prisoner
—an American woman who
has helped the Mexicans —back
to base.
They make the hazardous
journey across terrible terrain
only by the stone-cold courage
and tenacity of the man who
was a temporary coward, the
five battle-heroes showing-up
none too well under the pro-
tracted ordeal. The denouement
has imagination and powerful
dramatic impact.
Character-limning is sharp
and clear. Cooper, taciturn
and introspective, judges to a
nicety his gradual emergence
from uncertainty into real
leadership. Van Heflin is
strong as an intransigent ex-
criminal eaten-up with hatred
of the captain whose early
weakness he despises, and
flaunting his own reckless dis-
regard of danger. Rita Hay-
worth subtly keeps hatreds
boiling in her own interest until
she is forced into grudging
admiration for the lonely
leader. Even the usually
mediocre Tab Hunter stirs out
of stoniness to . give a fair
account of the lieutenant who
makes it brutally clear that he
is with the rebellious rankers
rather than with his captain.
The opening battle-scenes
are convincing and spirited;
and the rugged scenery is
finely photographed in good
color.

‘‘The Cheats”
Groups of young people who
band together on the Seine’s
Left Bank in pursuit of risky
excitement; who are con-
temptuous of conformism and
make it a point between the
sexes always to feign indiffer-
ence, though they practise
promiscuity, and who put on
the beatnik pretence of being
world-weary at 24, are given
the treatment in this ex-
cellent French film.
The story chiefly concerns the
student-son of a rich industri-
alist, and a young girl who
yearns for riches without ever
having worked for a living, and
who inhabits the fringes of
petty crime. They fall
genuinely in love despite the
tenets by which the “gang”
sets such store; and mis-
understandings lead to final
and poignant tragedy.
The types are drawn skil-
fully, none better than by
Laurent Terzieff as a cynical
intellectual with an amused
contempt for all ordered
society, and by Andrea Parisy
as an heiress choosing the
society of no-hoperS and anti-
conformists who would cheer-
fully see her own class broken.
The romantic leads are
handled adroitly by Jacques
Charrier and Pascale Petit.

NOT ANTI-BRITISH
From "M. T. PEZET," Fiji
There seems little doubt that the
trouble in Suva began because big
crowds had gathered near the bus-
station. Many were stranded ; bus-
and taxi-drivers had suddenly gone on
strike. Others came to hear an address
by the strikers’ leader, Mr. Anthony, an
Indian.* The police seem to have been
over-enthusiastic in dispersing the crowd,
and in their refusal to let Anthony speak.
Whatever it was, the trouble began
there, but it was hooligans which kept it
going. Most of the window-smashing
and looting, the smashing of street lights,
and the senseless breaking of doors and
windows at the Bayly Clinic, which cares
for the destitute of all races, was pure
hooliganism. One can’t help feeling
that a certain section of the population,
mostly teenage youths, had an uproarious
time during this period.
In Australia, this would have been
an outrageous outbreak of juvenile
delinquency. Here, with the mixed
population, it could easily spark-off race-
riots.
Although bars in Suva and Lautoka
(where a peaceful strike of big traders’
native employees was in progress at the
same time) were ordered closed until
further notice on Wednesday, the third
day of the strike, it was not enough.
On the fourth day, the Public Safety
Regulations were put into effect, and a
curfew declared from 7 p.m. to 5 a.m.
in Suva, Lautoka and Nandi Airport,
until further notice.
The curfew was rigidly enforced, and
patrols of police, the military, and
special constables patrolled the streets
and made many arrests for the breaking
of the curfew, especially in Suva.
There was some display of anti-
British feeling, and much was made of
this in overseas news. However, anyone,
aware of how intensely pro-British the
Fijian is knows that only a particular
section would display this feeling, and
most Fijians are desperately ashamed of
the outbreak.
The Vunivalu, Ratu George Thakom-
bau, and the five Fijian Members of the
Legislative Council addressed a large
crowd of Fijians on Saturday, December
12. They supported the oil-workers’
strike in that it is peaceful and the
workers are not paid enough to live
decently in Suva, where the cost-of-living
is much higher than in the country. But
they expressed strong disapproval of the
violence and shame that Fijians had
thrown stones at white men.
They stressed what most people here
realise: the white man is the. Fijians’
best friend. They added that the Fijians
are a physically strong race and warned
them to be careful that this strength is
not used by “other people” for their own
ends—in other words, that the “other
people” do the quiet planning and
the Fijians do the dirty work and fall
into disrepute.
Much more damage has been done
to Fiji than the smashing and looting
of a few shops. People overseas imagine
"Come down here and say that!"
the Fijians are turning against the
British (which isn’t so). Eleven-hundred
tourists on the Orcades were not allowed
to land, which could be a blow to the
tourist industry, now being so carefully
built-up. Almost half the banana-
shipment that should have left for New
Zealand is rotting on outlying islands
because there was no petrol to bring
them to Suva.
The colony can ill afford the possible
consequences of this trouble. It is
struggling to make ends meet and
desperately needs outside capital to
establish industries to provide employ-
ment for the increasing population.
Every year many children leave school
without hope of finding employment.
Unemployed men who have worked in
Suva or other towns are reluctant to
return to their villages where they are
sure of food but have to do without the
entertainments of a big town.
It is quite true that many men are
very poorly paid. Finance is not abund-
ant. The Government is cutting costs in
all directions, so that even essential ser-
vices, such as medical and educational, are
not getting anything like the money they
need, because the colony just hasn’t got
it. Industry isn't making the profits
it has in the past. It is rapidly coming
to the stage where men must decide
whether they want a poorly-paid job or
no job at all.
The strike and rioting has only
increased the colony’s outsize headache.
White people in Fiji are just as sorry
as the Fijians themselves that they have
“blotted their copybook” when they
know them for the intensely loyal people
they are. Others were involved; but
the Fijians were in the majority, and
they seemed to be the ones getting all
the mention.
The strike was called by the Whole-
sale and Retail Workers’ Union, but
only in its oil-workers’ section. It was
decided on, as publicly stated, “after
serious thought and careful planning.”
As a “Fiji Times” editorial pointed out,
the disruption of the transport system
smells of Communist tactics. Although
intimidation was strictly forbidden,
there seems to have been plenty of
intimidation of bus-drivers. Buses have
been turned back, threatened, and some
have unloaded passengers and mails and
not left the depot, when surrounded by
crowds. This may not have been the
strikers themselves doing it. They are
being carefully peaceful.
We are left with the question: Was
it all quite genuine and spontaneous, or
are there a few people quietly gloating
at the way things turned out and pleased
at some anti-British feeling, expressed,
paradoxically enough, by one of the
most cheerful and most loyal of all
British subjects, the Fijian?

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Felt and Textiles of Australia, Ltd.
TS7ool prices dropped sharply in
W 1951-52, and with them earnings of
Felt and Textiles of Australia, Ltd. The
parent and subsidiaries, all told, ran up
a loss of more than £470,000. Stringent
economies, however, and radical reorga-
nisation triggered-off powerful reflexes.
In the following year net earnings
recovered to over the half-million mark,
and by last term, with the best achieve-
ment to date, profits reached £706,061.
Tracing its lineage from a co. founded
in Sydney in 1921 to pioneer the manu-
facture in Australia of felted piecegoo.ds
(the focal-point of the organisation has
now shifted to Melbourne, where a new
and attractive administrative centre has
recently been erected), the Feltex
empire today bestrides three dominions —
Australia, New Zealand and South
Africa. In Australia it leads the field
in scouring and carbonising of wool,
making of wool-tops and also in pro-
duction of felt products and piece-
goods, felt floor-coverings, carpets and
footwear. In addition its wide range
of activities extend to the manufacture
of woollen and worsted yarns, non-
woven fabrics, plastic films and various
plastic-covered materials. During the
period just completed, the 50 p.c. interest
of Bradford Cotton Mills, Ltd., in the
tufted carpet co., Chattanooga Tufted
Carpets (Australia) Pty., was acquired.
Chattanooga thus became a wholly
owned subsidiary.
Consolidated sales (£34,076,000) were
£1,055,000 (approximately 3 p.c.) lower
than those of the previous year, but
results in the three countries mentioned
above could hardly be called unsatis-
factory.
The general impact of lower wool
prices on the Australian economy had
some effect on local showings, and
uncertain prices and strong competition,
both at home and abroad, caused con-
traction of profit margins. Prices of
processed wools fell, and, with them,
prices and sales of other woollen pro-
ducts. Sales of woollen and worsted
piecegoods, woollen felt and embroideries
all slipped, but fortunately were more
than countered by increased sales of
other products, particularly carpets and
footwear. Notwithstanding the lower
level of wool prices in the first nine
months of the financial year and the
consequent effect on demand, quantity
of greasy wool processed rose slightly.
At 40,400,0001 b. it was 1.6 p.c. above
the 1957-58 figure and equal to 17 p.c.
of all greasy wool processed in Australia.
Improved results of the N.Z. sub-
sidiary reflected, in the main, completion
of expansion programmes commenced in
earlier years. New records were estab-
lished in turnover and profits, the con-
solidated net profit, after tax, rising from
£A159,100 in 1957-58 to £A262,010 last
year. Of this, the Australian parent co.
received £A 108,382.
In South Africa lower prices and a
bad season made trading difficult. Profits
of the South African subsidiary were
less than in the previous year.
Overall, net profit for the group
reached £706,061 (£672,290 in 1958),
after deducting earnings attributable to
outside shareholders £422,813 (£406,065),
charging depreciation £697,203
(£629,530), and providing for taxation
£753,008 (£565,198):

N.Z. subsidiary issued 237,500 £NZI
ords. at a premium of 55., of which issue
the Australian parent received 129,307
shares. At balance-date consolidated
reserves bulked big at £6,102,612.
Expenditure on land and ' buildings,
including new administrative head-
quarters in Melbourne and Durban (S.
Africa), together with factory improve-
ments, saw book-values of fixed assets
well up on the previous year. Freeholds
and leaseholds lifted £339,092 to

£489,754 to £4,465,600. Gross outlay,
prior to depreciation, was £1,369,990.

Chattanooga, this move at the same time
contributing to variations in certain
other of the assets and liabilities.
Stocks on hand at £8,054,744 were

Creditors were up £352,120 at £2,669,703,
and, while working capital slipped
£24,131 it remained more than sufficient
(£8,736,721) for the group’s requirements.
Ratio of current assets to current liabili-
ties rose to 2.9 to 1 (2.7 to 1 in 1958).
Earnings this year should benefit from
current rises in wool prices. Demand
is keen for clean wool products, and the
establishment of a wool-futures market
in Sydney during 1960 will enable the
group to cover its wool-stock position
against price-fluctuations. A capital-
expansion of more than £l| million is
planned for Australia. Finance needed
will come from within the group. Pro-
ductive capacity will be increased at
the Tottenham (Vic.) carpet-factory
(£500,000) and also in the footwear
divisions, which are expected to turn
out million pairs of footwear this year.
A new £200,000 non-woven fabrics unit
will be constructed at Coburg, Victoria.

Business was good in 1959, the
Australasian Temperance and General
Mutual Life Assurance Society’s (to give
it its full name) 83rd year.
The co. writes ordinary, industrial and
accident policies throughout the Com-
monwealth and in New Zealand. Two
new subsidiaries, T. & G. Fire and
General Insurance, and T.G. Nominees
Pty., commenced operations during the
year. The results to date are reported
to be satisfactory.
During the term the co. brought over-
seas business and assets into the accounts
in terms of Australian currency, making
comparisons with previous years difficult.
But, acknowledging these changes,
in the ordinary Life department
48,941 policies were issued (up 1956),
with premiums amounting to £1,987,537
p.a. These policies assured £52,668,136,
excluding temporary assurances, and
£123,054 p.a. of annuities.
In the Industrial department a certain
shift in favor of O.D. was discernible.
There were 39,253 new policies (down
7598), assuring £5,754,073.
(The latest figures are in Australian
currency, those for previous years being
a mixture of overseas ancl Australian.)
Subject to currency differences, O.D.
income for the year ended September
30, 1959, was £2,175,423 higher at
£19,482,667. Expenses increased by
£421,463 to £2,974,356 and claims by
£965,523 to £6,740,599. Staff fund re-
ceived £67,695 and £178,039 was trans-
ferred to exchange reserve. O.D.
assurance and annuity funds were dis-
closed at £109,117,569 (up £12,402,344,
including £2,880,366 net undisclosed
addition to funds, apparently resulting
mostly from exchange adjustments, but
partly from property-revaluations.
Income for the year in I.D. was
£5,988,013 (up £328,329). Expenses
absorbed £94,429 less at £1,559,152, con-
tinuing the downward trend in operating-
costs achieved in the previous term.
Claims were £76,692 higher at
£2,348,344. Staff fund received £32,312
and exchange reserve £42,500. Assurance
and annuity funds were shown at
£36,264,792 (up £3,550,388, including
£1,544,683 undisclosed net addition to
funds).
In the accident department, which also
belongs to the policyholders, as there are
no shareholders in T. & G., personal
accident and sickness policies with annual
premiums amounting to £57,877 were
issued. Accident benefits with annual
premiums amounting to £50,209 were
added to ordinary and industrial
assurances. The accident-premium in-
come went up by £43,617 to £639,970.
The claims in this department “remained
at a satisfactory level.”
Total income in all departments was
£2,550,765 higher at £26,132,242. Pre-
miums amounted to £19,367,690 (up
£1,551,930) and income from invest-
ments £6,764,552 (up £998,835).
The effective interest rate —one of the
acid-tests for a life office—was satisfac-
tory at £4 19s. p.c. p.a., rising by 4s. 3d.
p.c. during the period under review. (The
rise in 1958 was 4s. lid. p.c.)
T. & G. paid a total of £9,332,200
to its policyholders during the year (up
£1,057,934). In the life departments death
claims amounted to £1,791,644 (up
£142,153), which was well within the
actuarial expectations, widening the mar-
gin left for bonuses on policies. Maturities
totalled £4,950,032 (up £462,113). Sur-
renders totalled £2,272,543.
Bases of valuation were once again
conservative. After providing for all
liabilities, and reserves for special pur-
poses, a surplus of £4,445,958 was dis-
closed in the life departments (£3,684,702
in O.D. and £760,356 in 1.D.). This was
an increase of £938,181 (subject to
currency changes) compared to 1958:

On the actuary’s recommendation the
co. set aside £47,000 for actuarial con-
tingencies and allotted £4,274,543 (up
£879,580) by way of reversionary bonuses
to participating-policies. Provision was
also made for “certain extra benefits,”
providing for increases in the annual
bonus-scales in both O.D. and I.D. The
co. also decided to allot increases to
“sums becoming payable to certain
policyholders” in the Accident Depart-
ment. Members thus received a larger
slice of T. & G.’s 1959 assurance-cake.
Total assets at the end of the year
were shown at a book-value of
£152,599,641 (up £18,485,706), including
a “partial revaluation of certain of the
society’s lands.” This revaluation was
probably also a factor in the jump in
total assurance funds.
The investment-portfolio’s pattern re-
mained much the same, with a con-
tinuing slow (but definite) trend away
from public securities to mortgages and
other loans and co. shares and deben-
tures :

opportunities for capital-gains, as against
what was once traditionally imagined
to be the only “really safe” capital-
placement (public securities), has in post-
war years become characteristic of the
assurance and insurance houses in Aus-
tralia and N.Z. It has been partially
responsible for sustaining a higher rate
of economic growth than would have
otherwise been possible.
This frame of the business mind is
unlikely to change as long as the Com-
monwealth Government’s fiscal policy
continues to favor life-assurance with
appreciable tax - concessions. Nor is it
likely that the assurance and insurance
societies, including the energetic and
prosperous T. & G., may stop expand-
ing and providing their policyholders

R. Fowler, Ltd.
Fowler began the
manufacture of pottery in
Sydney in 1837. Today R.
Fowler, Ltd., gathered to
corporate status in 1919, is a
leading manufacturer of sani-
taryware, stoneware, pipes,
etc. Products also include
crockery, wine-and-spirit jars,
wall- and floor-tiles and insu-
lators. Main works are at
Marrickville, N.S.W. ; plants
operate also in Victoria,
Queensland and South Aus-
tralia. In 1955 Marsfield
Pottery Pty., of Ryde (N.S.W.),
was taken-over, and last year
the issue of 19,000 fully-paid
20s. ords. accomplished the
acquisition of Australian Fire-
clay Co. Pty.
Contemporary pottery grows
less and less aesthetic and
more and more utilitarian. Last
term Fowler’s sales increased,
particularly of sanitaryware-
suites, pans and basins and all
subsidiaries contributed to the
aggregate result. Profit reached
£117,229 (up £8570), after de-
ducting an ample taxation pro-
vision of £100,028 (not pre-
viously disclosed) and depreci-
ation £47,680 (up £5509).
Four years before, profit was,
parent only, disclosed at
£38,626 ; yet even then it repre-
sented an earning-rate on
capital of 13.2 p.c. Admit-
tedly capital has increased
since then —ord. shareholders
last April collected one gift-
share for each share then held,
and, immediately after that
issue, the free scrip participat-
ing, benefited by a one-for-two
par offering. Ord. paid capital
lifted in consequence from
£261,700 to £607,825.
But, even allowing for in-
creased capita], earning-rates
have more than doubled.
Latest result works-out (con-
servatively, in view' of the tax-
provision) at 30.4 p.c. on
average ord. capital (that is,
after pref. entitlements), and
compares favorably at that
figure with the two preceding
years (39.9 p.c. and 35.6 p.c.):—

and last year settled slightly
to 111 p.c. but on the larger
capital. (Pref. capital is

buted profits, £71,388, went to

Book-values of freeholds rose
to £700,309 (up £155,045), and
kilns, plant, etc., to £348,924
(up £90,826). The second
tunnel-kiln at Marrickville was
brought into commission early
in the term, and a third tunnel-
kiln, also at Marrickville, is
in course of erection. It is
expected that this kiln will be
producing by early 1960. The
three kilns together should be
able to handle anticipated
developments in the demand
for sanitaryware. Extra manu-
factuting-space has been pro-
vided by the removal of the old
and now redundant intermittent
coal-fired pottery kilns.
Theoretical working-capital
improved considerably, and at
£422,526 (up £184,846) was
more than sufficient to cover
Fowler's requirements. Stocks
on hand rose £53,873 to
£360,514. book debts £21,847 to
£282,459 and cash £78,088 to
£78,611. Bank overdraft disap-
peared.
So far in the current year,
sales have been more than
maintained and prospects are
bright. Commercial, factory
and . home-building continues
on a high level. Directors
expect a greater share of the
sanitaryware market in Vic-
toria following strengthening
of the sales-organisation in the
southern State. But with the
coming of Doulton’s and others
to Australia, competition grows
stronger, especially following
the relaxation of import-restric-
tions. Nevertheless, expressions
of confidence are not lacking,
nor should they be. Directors
reckon on divs. of at least 10
p.c. on the increased capital,
and investors recently offered
525. 3d. for the £1 ords. At
this price, holdings yield 3.8 p.c.
from a 10 p.c. div. (or 4.7 p.c.
from 12y p.c.). Net asset-back-
ing is substantial: a healthy

South Alligator Uranium
TPhe first shipment of uranium
oxide (worth about
£44,500) was made from Pine
Creek (N.T.) to Adelaide in
the second half of October,
1959. By the end of Novem-
ber advance - payment of
£40,000 had been received from
the U.K. Atomic Energy
Authority under the contract
to supply it with uranium oxide
to a total value of about
£1,150,000 by early 1962.
About the same time South
Alligator delivered another
£46,000-worth of uranium
oxide to Adelaide for shipment
to U.K., completing its quota
for 1959.
By September 30, 1959, the
co. completed erection of an
acid leaching-solvent extrac-
tion-plant on the South
Alligator River (N.T.).
The treatment-plant was
constructed in conjunction
with S.A. Department of
Mines. Designed weekly
throughput is 117 short tons of
1 p.c. uranium ore. Capital-
expenditure and operating-costs
to September 30, 1959, totalled
£195,000, or £30,000 less than
was estimated.
Mining operations were
resumed in August, 1959. Up
to the close of accounts 94ft.
of development and 113 ft. of
stope-preparation were com-
pleted at Rockhole. -Produc-
tion figures show that 120 short
tons of ore were won and
398 short tons milled. Head
grade was 0.9 p.c. U3OB. The
value of production was
£21,000. By September 30.
1959, the plant was in con-
tinuous operation for nine
weeks. Value of oxide pro-
duced during this period was
about £90,000. Head grade
of the ore milled was over
1 p.c. uranium oxide. Addi-
tional 34 short tons of ore
came from development. Ore
reserves were unchanged -at
10,000 tons, assaying 1 p.c.
U3OB, containing an estimated
90 short tons of recoverable
uranium oxide.
At balance-date (Sept. 30)
paid capital was £495,000 in
620,000 f.-p. ss. vendor shares
and 1,360,000 f.-p. ss. ords. A
£160,000 loan was obtained
from the Commonwealth Bank
to provide part of finance for
capital-expenditure, repayable
from the proceeds of uranium-
oxide sales. The loan was
already reduced to £131,896,
plus £3418 bank overdraft:

Commonwealth Mining
/Commonwealth Mining

commenced operations with a
strong and mining-wise board
of directors and a paid-
up capital of £375 in 1955,
rising to £996,375 in 1956,
£1,000,000 in 1957 and
£1,451,500 in 10s. f.-p. ords.
in 1958. Since then no new
scrip has been issued. Most of
the co.’s .assets are invested in

The co. has paid a modest
4.33 p.c. (sd. per 10s. share)
dividend from its first full year

Operations for the year ended
June 30, 1959, resulted in a
profit of £89,057 from divi-
dends received, interest and
sundry income. Management
and general expenses (including
£303 depreciation) absorbed
£24,462, leaving net profit for
the year £8524 lower at
£64,595. This was equivalent
to an earning-rate of 4-44 p.c.
on the average ord. capital
employed.
Dividend was steady at 4.3
p.c., absorbing £60,479 (of
which £42,335 was tax-free).

N.Z. Sharemarket,
1959 and 1960
~pOE\v Zealand share prices,
on average, have risen
about 33 per cent, in the last
year.
Dividends have risen, too,
but not as much as prices.
Yields have fallen. Are they
now too low? In other words,
are prices too high?
Obviously the market as a
whole does not think so. Buy-
ing demand is still strong.
Is the market likely to
change its mind?
If yields are not too low
now, at what point would they
become too low?
Each investor must decide
these questions for himself,
and, in doing so, must, of
course, consider each share on
its own merits.
Nevertheless, a study of
averages might provide a use-
ful yardstick.
Average Yield 3.8 p.c.
At prices ruling about the
end of November, 20 of New
Zealand’s leading ordinary
shares showed an average yield
of 3.8 per cent.
This compares with an aver-
age yield for the same shares
of 4.9 per cent, in November,
J 958, and of 4.1 per cent, in
November, 1957.
The 1958 figure reflects the
depression of the market which
followed Mr. Nordmeyer's
“Black Budget” and the im-
position of dividend-tax.
Between November, 1957,
and November, 1959, average
yield for the 20 shares fell
from 4.1 per cent, to 3.8 per
cent.
Actually the fall was greater
than these figures show, be-
cause dividends in 1957 were
free of tax, while dividends in
1959 are subject to income-tax
up to 7s. in the £l, according
to the recipient’s other income.
For someone paying the
maximum rate of dividend-tax
a gross yield of 3.8 per cent,
is reduced to 2.5 per cent. net.
The 20 shares chosen for
analysis were: The ordinary
shares of the 10 biggest cash-
dividend-paying companies in
New Zealand, all with ordinary
capital of £1 million or more ;
and the ordinary shares of
another 10 representative New
Zealand companies, all with
ordinary capital of £500,000
or more.
Dividends only were taken
into account, bonus-payments
being disregarded. Five of the
20 companies paid a bonus in
addition to dividend in 1959.
Inclusion of these bonuses
would, of course, increase the
yield to some extent. The
sample 20 shares included a
gieater-than-average number
of low-yielding issues.
The 1959 yields ranged from
2.5 p.c. to 5.4 p.c. Four of
the shares analysed yielded 2
p.c. to 3 p.c.; seven 3 p.c. to
4 p.c.; seven 4 p.c. to 5 p.c.;
two more than 5 p.c.
The 1957 yields ranged from
2 p.c. to 7 p.c. Three of the
shares analysed yielded 2 p.c.
to 3 p.c.; six 3 p.c. to 4 p.c.;
eight 4 p.c. to 5 p.c.; five more
than 5 p.c.
It will be noted that in both
1957 and 1959, 14 of the 20
shares were in the 3 p.c.-to-
-5 p.c.-yield category.
Government Rate 4f p.c.
What should the current
yield of 3.8 p.c. be measured
against?
The official medium-term
Government borrowing rate is
4.75 p.c., and the current aver-
age final maturity-yield from
medium,term stocks is 4.70 p.c.
it
The official local - body
borrowing-rate is 5 p.c., and
the average final maturity-yield
from local-body debentures
sold during October was
almost exactly 5 p.c.
Average final maturity-yield
from medium-term Govern-
ment stocks a year ago was
4.96 p.c. Two years ago it was
also 4.96 p.c.
Between November, 1957,
and November, 1959, while
medium - term Government
stock yield fell from 4.96 p.c.
to 4.70 p.c., yield from the
20 shares analysed fell from
4.1 p.c. to 3.8 p.c.
On these figures, the margin
was virtually unchanged, but
in fact, of course, it widened
by the amount by which
dividend-tax reduced equity-
yield.
Equity Yield Down for Good?
It has been suggested that
equity yield has moved per-
manently onto a lower plane
in relation to gilt-edged yield
than .has been customary in
the past.
In trying to make any fresh
assessment of how current
equity yield measures up
against gilt-edged yield, there
are many factors to be con-
sidered.
In calculating Government
stock and local-body deben-
ture-yields, the market-price is
first adjusted by deducting
accrued interest included in the
price and then adding broker-
age.
In calculating yields on
shares the market price is used.
No deduction is made for divi-
dends which could be assumed
to have accrued and no addi-
tion is made for brokerage.
Stock- and debenture-interest
is subject to full income-tax
and to social-security tax.
Share-dividends are subject to
income-tax only up to a maxi-
mum of 7s. in £l, according to
the recipient’s other income
and are exempt from social
security tax, which is paid by
the company.
Government - stockholders
have the assurance that their
nominal income will not vary
and that, if they hold to
maturity, they will receive their
capital back intact —neither
more nor less. Yield is calcu-
lated to include capital-gain if
the stock is bought below par.
Shareholders have no such
security. Their income may
fall and their capital may
decline ; on the other hand,
both income and capital may
increase. If capital does
increase, the gain will be tax-
free.
Inflation Hedge
The shareholder has what
the Government stockholder
lacks—some built-in protection
against inflation, and prospects
of true income- and capital-
growth.
For the 20 shares analysed,
average dividend was a neat
10 p.c.
Average earning-rate on
ordinary capital, however, was
17.9 p.c.
In other words, dividends
were covered 1.8 times.
That means that earnings-
yield was 6.8 p.c.
That is not something in
the future. It is here and now.
The difference between the
dividend-yield, 3.8 p.c., and the
earnings-yield, 6.8 p.c., belongs
to the shareholder, though it
is not at his disposal mean-
time, being retained by the
company.
The general practice by com-
panies of retaining part of
annual profits gives them
greater working-capital with
which to increase future profits,
ultimately distributed to share-
holders by way of higher
nominal dividends or bonus-
share issues.
Average net tangible asset-
backing per £1 of share-capital
in the 20 companies analysed
for 1959 was 465. sd.
For 13 of the 20 shares
asset-backing was between
30s. and 40s. per £1 of capital ;
for four, between 40s. and
505.; for three, more than 50s.
To sum-up: Of the 20 shares
analysed, 15 had an asset-
backing of more than 30s. per
£1 of capital, and, also, a divi-
dend covered more than \\
times.
Of these 15, six yielded 4 p.c.
or more ; six yielded between
3 p.c. and 4 p.c. ; and three
yielded less than 3 p.c.
It should be remembered
that company-profits and asset-
values are usually conserva-
tively stated.
True earning - rates and,
therefore, earnings - yields,
would, no doubt, be rather
higher than shown. True asset-
backing would, also, in many
cases, be higher than shown.
How, then, does a share
with a yield of about 3.8 p.c.,
an earnings-yield of about
6.8 p.c., and an asset-backing
of at least 150 p.c. of capital,
measure-up against a fixed-
interest investment with a
yield of about 4.7 p.c. to 5 p.c.?
In trying to answer this
question the investor must first
consider several others: What
is the economic outlook for the
country generally? Will infla-
tion continue and, if so, to
what extent? Will the supply
of shares continue to be
restricted by capital-issues
control? Will the recently
increased flow of new money
into the sharemarket from
small investors and from
institutions and pension-funds
be maintained, or still further
increased, or will it bo
reduced? Would a change of
Government next year be
followed by a reduction in
company- or dividend-tax?.


A WANDERER RETURNS IN TWO PARTS: PART I
COUNTRY TOWN
By HAL PORTER
This, you must know, is
less a story of people
than of a country town.
Australian? Unmis-
takably. Plot? Yes —oh, yes*
quite. Life? Yes. Love?
Well —y-e-e-e-s. For example,
I am put-out to know That, in
some wet and windy part of
my mind, / love this home
town as one might inescapably
love a hypocrite uncle as boring
as immortality and with the
points of view of a blowfly, or
a recurring sweet dream one
knows too well is a dream, or
a cocktail that has a terrific
lift though it tastes like the
inside of a coffin. Love, you
think? Life? Eh?
I left the place over 30 years
ago. Absence did no more
than qualify me to dispassion
about Before and After, to
make me see more clearly what
happened next, the total to
date, the new make-up and
changed lighting after Inter-
mission. All I learned while
out smoking the cigarettes too
gaudily labelled Experience, is
—a safe cynicism—that civi-
lisation makes anything no less
accidental, anything at all:
living, lusting, dying and so on.
I return one sunset, acci-
dental (you see!) —accidental
nice timing—the town seems,
for far too small a slice of
time, to be not one skerrick
changed. It has the “High
Noon” frontier-town look all
Australian country towns have
when horizontal rays stress that
two stories is the limit and in
Main Street only, that the rest
of the town is on one floor
and largely weatherboard.
Those ridge-and-gulch acres of
corrugated iron roofs! Those
chimneys! a functioning
museum of bricklayer fashions:
1873, 1885, 1902, 1919, 1926,
1938, 1959 . . .
My nostalgic, just-tearless
eye strains to unfade on upper-
floor brick side-walls elderly
words still there from my boy-
hood and earlier: Bush's
Family Grocer, Kyle’s Cash
Bakery, Mantles and Robes,
Horse Bazaar Omnibus

plate-glass canted off the

piles of packing-cases. The two
poplars still domineer, dead-
centre of the town, like nervous
Azraels ; the aluminium-painted
penny-farthing sits, as ever, air-
ridden on the roof-line of the
bicycle-shop.
Well, well! Are there, be-
neath these tongue-and-groove
false fronts and stucco krateres,
still fruitshops unaware of
sweet-corn, cantaloupes, milk-
bars, and juke-boxes but
which display, as of old, their

flaccid rhubarb and firkin-
sized iron'oark pumpkins under
fretwork arches and dusty
witchballs? Does artificial

butcher’s plate-glass in front
of the parsley-eyed pig’s-head
on its fly-corpse-curranted
grey marble?
Is the arc of enamelled letters
BOURNVILLE
COCOA (two letters
always missing) stuck yet on
grocers’ shop-windows?
No; and forever, no.
No the monumental mason’s
granite urns and scrolls poking
through the horehound and
fennel; no the smithy, the
saddler’s, the doctors’ red
lamps, the Show Day proces-
sion, the elm avenues, the
hitching-rings on shop-veranda
posts ; no - the hickory golf-
clubs, mashie and cleek,
washerwomen, bullockies,
knickerbockered boys in boots,
girls in ribbed stockings, the
hat on every outdoor head,
the immodestly-defining cotton
bathers from which inky dye
seeped into the white-edged
sleevelets, and no no no the
sound of hoofs on gravel roads.
Gone cabby, rabbit-oh and
fish-oh, John Chinaman green-
grocer, the Dago icecream-cart
and its bell, the Hindu old-iron
man, the scissors-grinder, the
Afghan pedlar, and all their
clockwork nags which wore in
midsummer their earholed
equine millinery above wow-
serish William S. Hart faces ;
gone the medieval pageantry of
black-satin hearse - horses,
Black Prince plumes, and top-
hatted undertakers in cutaway
coats. Gone what was called
the night-cart—though it came,
two-horsed, also in daylight, a
zeppelin-grey tank-like machine,
two stories high, back-to-back
terraces of dunny-can cubicles
that clanged shut as jails must
clang. That was one of the
town’s sounds.
Early in December, I recall,
one found a card on the
lavatory-seat:
Enjoy Christmas as best you
can,
And don’t forget the dunny-
man.
Did parents leave a Christian
half-crown near the egg-shaped
hole? Or, not breathing, way-
lay the burly leper, the un-
touchable with the top of his
felt hat squashed so horizontal
from reeking cylindrical
burdens that he appeared
mathematically scalped, and
present some gift with a
gracious clause? I don’t
remember. One should know,
but . . .
I knew lies, carnality, happi-
ness, despair, even viciousness
and ennui. I had heard of
Rembrandt, Bach, Pavlova,
Tutankhamen and Jack-the-
Ripper, but never of fish-and-
chips, spaghetti or grapefruit.
Oh, a local, a yokel, a hick, a
peasant, a great gadah, a simple
country boy from Woop-
Woop!
Had I heard of wireless?
There were, I suppose, crystal-
sets in the shire, but as I
prowled back-streets, criminally
nonchalant, to steal quinces or
blood-filled Satsumas, I heard
only the melancholy of old-
maid uprights behind fringed
green blinds. Fingers of un-
seen pale hands tinkling
“..../ loved beside the
Shalimar... where, indeed,
are you now?
Piano or no piano, just
around the next picket-fence
coriler overhung by cassias lay,
had I known it, the opening of
Canberra, “The Jazz Singer,”
the Depression, miniature golf,
club sandwiches, and, for me,
long pants, silk socks, Mel-
bourne (the City!) and what
I thought was Life. It took
years, that last one.

life, kings and kingdoms
foundered, bombs dropped as


frequently as bricks, the moon
to be colonised by scientific
dogs or mad Crusoes, I return,
middle-aged and less degage
than I thought, to another
chainstore town.
Fluorescent street - lights
glare on the metallic Venetians
and desperately garish front-
doors. Neons display their
tics above all the pubs, the
cinema, the drive-in, the ice-
block automat, the auto-port,
the self-service petrol-bowser,
the motel, the transport-drivers’
steak-and-egg roadhouses, and
the caravan-park, the machico-
lated public lavatories of which,
like Disney castles, have been
built with municipal delicacy
on the top of pioneer graves.
Neons utter Hamburgers, Fish
and Chips, Milk Bar, All Night
Cafe, Smokes, Snacks, Eats—
God-knows-what-else and
Espresso.
The pretty, shingled virgins
in berets who tormented my
adolescence, and Black-

the Mechanics’ Hall —choco-
late-stencilled dado on hospital-
corridor green, tangerine crepe-
paper streamers looped into
gasless gasoliers under the

beneath the Wandering Jew

Maxim’s Espresso smoking
king-size filter-tips, Conti-
nentally rapping-out “Cappu-
cino!” and tempting the Provi-
dence of matronly zippers as
they stretch to choose with
plastic tongs another musty
Jewish-Viennese cake from
under the plastic cover. For-
sworn the pottery teapot, the
toasted ham-sandwich and
cheese-cakes!
Coroneted sewer - poles
pierce up in every direction,
but hoisted high above them
like the Euclid problems of
ex-avant-garde wire-sculpture

and sinister fad —the h.-p.
TV-aerials.
Had I foreseen all these?
Nearly all, for they are every-
where else: the fluorescents,
the production-belt con-
trumpery, the Woolworthery,
the wrought-iron knicknackery,
the Yankeefied barbecue furni-
ture, cheapjack self-service
stores, Cellophaned rubbish,
grubbed-out street elms, muni-
cipal vandalism, pre-fab.
schoolrooms, jerry-built Com-
mission houses, “1984” public-
address systems, the arc-lit
pennants and tubbed privets
of the secondhand car dealers,
the labor-pains of a second
Industrial Revolution how
could I not have foreseen? But
I had not foreseen that I
should spend my first night in
what, to me, was Mrs. Topper’s
bedroom.
In days when tracks in the
river-bank grass or across
homestead paddocks were
triple, two for wheels plus one
for hooves, and are now merely
car-wheel double, in days when
Christmas meant eucalypt
saplings adorning every
veranda-post of every shop,
when jews’-harps and German
transfers could be bought, and
cigarette-cards were silk-
covered, Topper was a school-
boy friend and was what I con-
sidered rich.
His parents’ house, with
slate-roof, wide verandas,
stables, orchard, tennis-court,
septic-tank, even its palm-lawn,
arbutus and monkey-puzzle
had, for me, then, much
elegance. Lorraine Lee roses
sum it up: they were just in;
Topper’s had them. We played
Mah Jongg, listened to “Horsey
Keep Your Tail Up” and “O
Katharina” on a Victrola
inside, a portable Decca out-
side, ate the non-alcoholic
almond-porcupined trifles left
over from Mrs. Topper’s
parties and, to make the
bosomy housemaid bounce
about screeching like a cocka-
too, chewed mouthfuls of
walnuts which we regurgitated
in front of her, pretending we
vomited.
One Saturday a charitable
bazaar called a Garden Fete
was held there. All I remember
is one stall, lattice-hung with
home-made wistaria, and run
by the cinema pianist, a bony
fluting spinster beaked as, and
now dead as, Virginia Woolf.
A blue paper-chrysanthemum
at each temple, and hung with
a kimono, she sold heart-
shaped red velveteen pin-
cushions, shirt-flannel pen-
wipers, gilded wheels made of
matchbox drawers (what were
they for?) and the first Turkisn-
delight I had tasted.
And once, as though destiny
were showing me the other
side of the medal first —the
ornamental side, the side for
romantic little boys, a side to
remember —I was taken into
Mrs. Topper’s bedroom when
she had some malaise to say
“Hullo,” or even “Hello.”
Since my own bed was rather
shame-makingly like the brass-
and-enamel iron deathbed of
Pius XII at Castel Godolfo,
her wagon-sized one of fumed
oak had a Cecil B. de Mille
quality and Mrs. Topper,
fragile and eau-de-cologned,
rather the air of Gloria
Swanson.
The room seemed to me
enormous, and was large : its
lavender wallpaper was
panelled with strips of what:
formed the terribly dainty
black-and-silver freize. Through
the lace curtains of the bay-
window could be seen, far off
behind the pergola of Dorothy
Perkins roses, the morass where
I waded for swans’ and plovers’
eggs, and learned to smoke,
having stolen three Brittania-
embossed pennies for the
packet from my mother’s
kitchen-purse, the shabby
morocco one with the steel
catch.
"[Vow, here I was, more years
later than seemed possible
even to me who had enthusiasti-
cally used-up or outrageously
thrown away every hour of
them, in Mrs. Topper’s bed-
room for the second time—to
sleep there for one night.
Topper’s is now a boarding-
house for men, run as scrupu-
lously as a hospital by
Hungarians called New Aus-
tralians ; a hoarding under the
monkey-puzzle shouts Some-
thing-or-other Guest House.
The property has been sub-
divided ; women’s - magazine
houses, architectural illiteracies
of built-in plywood and man-
made fibres, share out such
Topper trees as remain. The
house is also subdivided, parti-
tions bisecting rooms, fibro-
plaster sleepouts lining the
verandas.
Some garage-hand or gas-
works stoker is always remov-
ing Al Jolson under the
shower; ironstone china
clashes in the pantry; tran-
sistor wirelesses play con-
stantly and from every direc-
tion, and —oh, that other side
of the medal! —Mrs. Topper’s
bedroom, with aseptically
white walls, contains four
monk-cell beds, four gents.’
wardrobes, four bedside cup-
boards and leading-lamps,
four clean hideous little mats.
Cheek-by-jowl the mep live
like well-behaved Dutch dolls.
Since I was to sleep once
only in this room —there was
some one-day hitch about a
promised bungalow outside —
I was unpacking just enough
to make a homing-perch, and
getting my eye in before going
out to get anaesthetically drunk,
for in no other way would I
be able to sleep in this dormi-
tory with three unknowns
whose paraphernalia disposed
strictly in each quarter-room
advertised variously addicted
men but indubitable young
ones, young blokes and to be
eluded: middle-aged men of
my sort relish young men far
less than old men do.
I was, however, not quickly
enough unpacked to escape
young men for, in acrobat vees.
patently dewy from a shower,
enter, vigoroso, on peanut-
shaped toes, one of them. Say,
rather, a young man made an
entrance: chest out, stomach
in, a pas seal seemed imminent.
Instantly, though it was im-
possible, I felt I knew him,
had met him. He was some-
what above short, flaxen,
pretty as a pretty ape with little
electric-blue eyes which, in a
crackle, assessed my suit and
shoes and condoned his cold-
bloodedly phosphorescent smile
and knuckle-deforming hand-
shake.
My mind said, “Ouch!” He
was pleased to meet me, man.
I how-d’-y’-do’ed. He was
Kurt Schmidt, man. He was
now —ha, ha—a dinkum Aussie,
man. I felt that I what-is-
known-as winced. He flexed.
Now he would examine my
silver-mark.
His torso and arms were
physical-culture-magazine, Mr.
Universe ; he kept on flexing
these upper wonders which
tapered to skinny legs bandy
as Rupert Brooke’s and feet;
small as a girl’s. Decidedly
better kit-cat than full.
TTe strutted, he prattled,
reluctant to obscure his
top-heavy form, to enclose it
in whatever usually contained
it; he juggled two cut-in
dimples as Sonia Henje used
to —oh, he turned it on. His
English was good though
larded with bodgie-isms and
low camp patter that were
not quite right. There was
deliberation, shrewdness, an
act. Self-possessed as a musical-
comedy child he dealt questions
at me like a Five Hundred hand.
How long was I sojourning in
this weirdsville burg, huh?
What did I do for a crust?
How had I got here? Did I
have a car? He stopped short
of asking my salary.
Did I have a car, huh? When
I told him that I could not
drive one, and that I had
absolutely no desire to own
one, it was as though I had
stabbed him. “Oh, no!” he
cried in agony. So I was a
weird-o! Did l have any bread?
I saw him think that. I saw
him jettison his first assessment,
sensed his interest change
direction ; he became as busy
and charming as a cat when the
refrigerator is opened. But I
must have a car, man, just for
hacking round, like. For cruis-
ing, huh? He became fanatic
as a missionary ; his voice went
off-key with zeal. Daddy-o, a

INOCULATION
By
JACK LUSBY
< Y ow’s the shoulder
I—l now, Blue?” said the
JL JL Flying Doctor.
The red - headed
stockman was squatting philo-
sophically in the shade of a
wing. “Feels all right, Doc,”
he said.
“You look a hundred per
cent, on when old Tommy
Stirrup brought you in. You’re
a lucky man.”
“Yeah. He tracked me for
a coupla days, too.”
“H’m. We’re not going
direct to Charleville. Got to
land and give some kids
inoculations. Only make an
hour or so difference.
“I’ll be right.” Blue gave
a tight-skinned grin.
“Hop in, then.”
It was a neat, smallish three-
engined de Havilland. Inside,
the pilot broke off what he’d
been saying to the nursing-
sister and looked inquiringly
back at the doctor.
“Inoculations at Krooter’s
place first stop, Fred,” the
doctor told him. “D’you know
it?”
“I’ve been there. You’ve got
to see it to believe it!” -
“How many children?”
asked the nurse.
“You’ll have to muster them
to count them. At least half-a-
dozen.”
“Right,” said the nurse.
“Here, Blue, let me do that
strap up.”
“All set, Fred,” said the
doctor.
The engines came to life in
turn. The plane taxied, swung
round at the boundary-fence,
raced over the sun-baked
ground. Windorah turned
slowly on a dipped wingtip
and dropped away. The plane
climbed, bumping in the mid-
morning heat.
For half-an-hour Blue
watched a featureless land-
scape moving beneath them.
But for a sore throb in the
bandaged shoulder he’d have
dozed.
Suddenly the ground looked
a lot closer. Anthills and
scattered saltbush cast short
shadows. A rough-looking
homestead and outbuildings
flashed past and a rutted track
streamed below like a ribbon.
Then the-plane turned steeply
and, looking forward, Blue
saw the pilot studying the
ground.
Near the end of the land-
ing-run the plane swerved
twice to miss anthills. Then
the pilot swung it round and
switched-off.
“Come on, Blue,” the nurse
said. “Get out and stretch
your legs.”
“God, it wouldn’t hurt him
to knock those anthills down!”
The pilot sounded hostile.
“I thought we were going to
knock ’em down,” said the
doctor. “This is his landing-
strip, I suppose?”
“This is it. Typical Krooter.
And about six miles from
where he lives. Take him a
while to get here. Relax and
have a smoke.”
Tn due course a dust-cloud
approached and the sun
glinted on something in front
of it. A battered Ford utility
bumped to a standstill about
50yds. from the plane.
The big man who burst out
of the truck and strode towards
them wore a broken-down,
flapping sombrero, a blue shirt
open to the waist and ragged
gabardine pants. One boot
gaped at the sole like a snap-
ping crocodile. When still a
few yards away he stopped
suddenly, peeled-off the gaping
boot and rubbed his bare foot
vigorously.
“Bloody bindies!” he said
in a loud, hoarse voice. Then
he replaced the boot and came
on, freckled paw outstretched.
Introductions and hand-
clenching over, Krooter waved
a massive arm towards the
truck. The doctor picked up
his bag and started over with
the nurse.
“We may as well be in it,
Blue,” said the pilot. At the
truck he gave Blue a leg-up
into the back and climbed in
after him. The truck started
and jolted towards the track.
The ramshackle “homestead”
was in a state of incredible dis-
repair. Two saplings propped
one corner. As the truck’s
passengers disembarked, two
tatterdemalion children dis-
appeared under a corrugated-
iron water-tank. Two more
went under the house. One
climbed an old coolibah tree
and another hurtled over the
bank of a distant earth-tank.
A truly enormous woman
appeared in a doorway.
“Put the billy on, Mum!*’
bawled Krooter. Inside the
house, while a big black billy
came to the boil, pannikins
were distributed all round. The
tea was good and strong.
“Better get it done,”
Krooter said then, and took
a full-length stockwhip from
the wall. He went outside and
sent the whip snaking under
the water-tank.
“Git inside with your
Mum!” he told the two sullen
young Krooters who emerged
like magic.
Krooter stooped and swung
his big arm and the whip
snapped like a dog under the
house, flushing two more
escapees who were also herded
inside. The whip barely
reached the tight pants of the
Krooter in the coolibah, but it
was enough. He came down
like a shot goanna.
There was an eroded and
hip-shot pony saddled and tied
near the house. While Mum
kept close guard on the cap-
tives, Krooter rode off to
muster the sprinter who’d gone
to earth beyond the ground-
tank. The pony must have
remembered something of
earlier stock experience. After
a bit of zigzagging, the whip-
cracking and hoarse threats
carried on the dusty air, the
runaway was turned and
headed for home.
Tn the house the victims were
lined-up in readiness. The
doctor held his hypodermic.
Krooter brandished his whip.
“If you beller, you bastards,
I’ll lay it across you! ” he
roared.
Between the needle and the
whip the young Krooters were
shivering like scared colts.
They were so jumpy the nurse

had to hold them steady, one
by one, for the doctor.
“And / been moanin’ about
having a tough spin!” Blue
muttered to the pilot. “Hey,
how d’you tell the boys from
the girls?”
“It calls for close study,”
said the pilot.
Boy or girl, each young
Krooter when released shot
from the house like a startled
cat. Finally quiet reigned, the
doctor closed his bag and the
whip went back on the wall.
Not a junior in sight. It was
after midday.
“Y’ll stay and have a feed,”
Krooter announced. “Mum !’’
Mum was far too massive to
jump or she’d have jumped
to it. She began to move
majestically about the battle-
field getting tin plates, pan-
nikins and a carving-knife for
Krooter.
“Where are the young ’uns?”
asked the doctor, attacking his
meal.
“Cranky,” said Krooter.
“They'll come back after a
while.”
The nurse cut Blue’s slab of
beef for him.
“Had a buster, eh?” Krooter
observed.
“Yeah,” Blue confessed.
“Lost me horse, too. He’ll
be headed for Bourke.”
“My kids won’t be far
behind him by now,” said
Krooter. “Never seen such
a touchy mob.”
Meal finished, they all went
outside and stood in the scant
shade having a smoke. Krooter
came round from the back of
the house breathing fire.
“Those bloody kids! Gettin’
their own back! The sheep’s
gone!”
“The sheep?” said the
doctor.
“Freeman sent it over yester-
day. Change from beef all
the time. Those little
bastards’ve untied it and
hunted it! By the livin’ God
I’ll ”
Krooter, even his broken
boot flapping angrily, strode
to where a sheet of rusty tin
leaned against one of the
tortured trees of the area. He
dragged out a gaunt, whitish
spotted cattledog. The dog's
stomach seemed shrunk from
sight and a stick could have
been rattled along his ribs.
Krooter unchained the dog
and pointed to the horizon.
“Git hold of him, Snow!”
he roared. “Go and git him,
son! ”
Snow made straight for the
trough and began to drink.
He drank with the gusto of
a thirsty elephant. As he drank
the audience could see him
filling out, like a balloon being
inflated. He continued gulp-
ing madly while Krooter stood
over him, exhorting with
cooee and bellow.
“Git hold of him, Snow!
Git hold of him, son!”
He booted Snow away from
the trough, and Snow made
sluggish progress for 200yds.
to the shade of an old-man
saltbush, where he sat down.
The nurse, who had a
brushing - acquaintance with
ordinary, run - of - the - mill
blasphemy; covered her ears
and her eyebrows shot up to
her hairline.
IZrooter wiped some froth
from his mouth, ran to the
derelict pony and took a flying
leap into the saddle. But the
girth had been loosened and
Krooter finished on the flat of
his back.
“You really needled those
kids, Doc,” said the pilot.
“They’ve probably pulled our
wings off.”
Krooter put his flapping
boot against the pony’s ribs,
hauled the girth tight and got
mounted. The overburdened
pony departed in a staggering
trot. Half - an - hour later
Krooter reappeared driving the
sheep.
As the sheep came abreast
of the old-man saltbush Snow
launched himself at it, seized
a hind leg in his jaws and hung
on. Krooter dismounted like
a man bulldogging a bullock.
“Good boy, Snowy. Let
him go,' son. Let him go !”
Krooter leaned over the dog,
beating him with his hat and
doing further damage to his
boots. But Snow’s primitive
instincts were working over-
time. He wasn't going to
relinquish his grip on a feed
of mutton. So Krooter
jammed one boot on the dog’s
head, grabbed the sheep’s hind-
leg in both fists and pulled.
“Let go, you bastard!”
Heartfelt Ba-a-as from the
sheep accompanied this lusty
tug-o’-war. Krooter managed,
eventually, to skulldrag the
hind-leg from Snow’s jaws.
He remounted and drove a
badly-shaken sheep back to
the house and tied him up.
“Nice work!” said the
doctor with a loud handclap.
“And now we must go.”
“Right. Pile aboard the
truck! ”
The engine roared but the
truck refused to budge.
Krooter stared at the track
“We should have got it over before siesta."
ahead, a puzzled expression
forming under his hat-brim.
He let the engine splutter to
silence.
“What’s wrong, Mum?” he
bawled.
“Those kids! Come out and

miraculously at about 50yds.
range to watch the departure.
And a bag of cement was
wedged firmly against a rear
wheel.
“By God I’ll lay it across you
when I get back!” Krooter
bellowed at them.
He wrenched the cement-
bag clear and got back in the
truck. This time the truck
moved, but there was a fearful

The Year in Retrospect
The year which ends on Thursday
saw in its latter months so many
goings and comings of national
leaders, so many pre-summit meet-
ings and so much talk of an imminent
top-summit meeting that most people
have probably forgotten that it opened
on a much less promising note with
Khrushchev’s threat and ultimatum
hanging over the world.
The Soviet leader’s ultimatum was
delivered on November 27, 1958. It
put forth plans for a “free-city” status
for Berlin and told the Western Powers
that if a four-Power agreement had not
been reached by May 27, 1959, Russia
would act alone. To this the United
Kingdom, the United States, France and
Germany had replied rejecting the “free-
city” proposal and denying the Soviet’s
right to change the status of the occupied-
zones by unilateral action. They
suggested a meeting of Foreign Ministers
to precede a summit-meeting—a pro-
cedure Khrushchev had earlier rejected
as unnecessary. The Western plea was
that it was no good holding a top-level
conference unless the matters to be dis-
cussed had been decided on in advance,
but there was also the feeling that Presi-
dent Eisenhower’s poor state of health
contributed to the U.S. State Depart-
ment’s reluctance.
Top-level Tourists
TV/fucH of the credit for breaking the
deadlock must be given to British
Prime Minister Macmillan, who, donning
a fur cap he had worn to Russia 30 years
previously, set-out on a mission to Mos-
cow which set the fashion for national
leaders for the rest of the year. After
Moscow he visited Paris, Bonn, Montreal
and Washington. Then De Gaulle visited
Bonn and London ; Adenauer went to
London and Paris; Vice-President
Nixon hit the trail for Moscow and Presi-
dent Eisenhower did the rounds of Lon-
don, Paris and Bonn. Khrushchev
showed the hammer-and-sickle on a
coast-to-coast tour of the United States,
and in December, Eisenhower set-out on
a plane-stop trip that took him to 19 (or
was it 29) capitals in an arc from Lisbon
to New Delhi. Taking it all round, 1959
could well be called the year of the
top-level tourists.
At near-top level was the trip to
Moscow of British Labor-leaders Gait-
skell and Aneurin Bevan, whose quiet
contemplation of the Kremlin and Red
Square was rudely interrupted by news
from London that Macmillan had named
the day for the general election they
had been asking him for ever since the
Suez affair. At the election a few weeks
later the Conservative Government, which
at the beginning of the year had seemed
almost certain of defeat, was returned
with its majority of 56 increased to 100.
The result greatly strengthened
Macmillan’s authority for further talks
with the leaders of other Powers.
Australian Scene
Tn Australia the year was one of elec-
tions. When it opened the Federal
Government was still experiencing the
flush of its fifth successive victory. At
the election five weeks earlier it had
increased its numbers by two, and, with
77 members in a full-voting House of
121, had the biggest majority in the his-
tory of the Commonwealth. The Labor
Opposition, feeling at the beginning of
the year very much as the U.K. Labor
Party was to feel at the end of it, had
to deal with yet another palace-revolu-
tion inspired by the slogan “we’ll-never-
win-with-the-Doc.” Evatt, down but by
no means out, showed no desire at all
to give the malcontents a chance to test
their theory under another leader. At
the caucus-meeting before the new Parlia-
ment opened he survived a challenge by
Ward, scoring 46 votes to Eddie’s 32.
Yet the year’s end found him shaking
the moths out of his old judge’s wig
while Ward and Calwell (and others)
looked hopefully in their shaving-mirrors
for leadership material.
Historically the two chief events of
the Federal political year were the
Members Salaries’ Bill and the Uniform
Divorce Act. On the first issue the Labor
Opposition put on an exhibition of
shadow-sparring that would have done
credit to the Invisible Man, but when
the division-bells rang no Labor member
voted against the increase. Seven
abstained from voting—but not from
accepting the extra pay.
The Salary Grab had a hostile recep-
tion from the Australian press and public.
What annoyed people most was the
strong contrast between the eagerness of
members to retain their seats and the
hard-luck stories they told the salaries
commission of the trials and burdens
of M.P.s. Later in the year the people
of New South Wales were to hear a
similar tale from their M.L.A.s, who
followed the example of their Federal
colleagues, but went one better by back-
dating their rise six months.
The Uniform Divorce Bill, though it
raised some bitter controversy, was a
triumph for Attorney-General Barwick
and for the principle of party-co-opera-
tion on a subject which could be regarded
as non-political. Notable, too, for the
reason that it gave the Senate an oppor-
tunity of reasserting its rights as a House
of Review by inserting an amendment
which brought the Reps, back from
recess to endorse it.
Four Elections
TC lections were held in four States
-®- / during the year, but only in West-
ralia was there a change of Govenrment,
Labor Premier Hawke and his team
being narrowly defeated after six years
in office. David Brand became the new
Premier. N. S. Wales went to the polls
on the same day as Westralia, but with
better success from the home-team’s
point of view. The Cahill Government,
in office since 1941, lost two country
seats (Dubbo and Young) to the Opposi-
tion, but won Hurstville from Clive
Evatt, emerging with a bare majority of
one after appointing a Speaker. A win
in the Lisinore by-election brought
Labor’s strength back to the pre-election
figure, 49.
This election-victory put N. S. Wales
Labor in line for a 20-year run in office ;
but Premier Cahill was not destined to
see the full distance. In June he passed
the record of Sir Bertram Stevens for
the longest term as Premier ofN.S. Wales,
but at the end of October, after an illness
of a few hours, he died in Sydney Hos-
pital, next door to Parliament House.
He was succeeded as Premier by R. J.
Heffron, who inherited with the title
instructions from the State executive of
the A.L.P. to get rid of the Legislative
Council. Thanks to the rebellion of
seven Labor M.L.C.s, the Upper House
refused to be its own executioner; it
enters 1960 intact, though still under
sentence.
The South Australian election (in
March) left the party-strengths unchanged
and Tom Play ford still in the saddle after
21 years. There was, however, one very
important difference in the new Parlia-
ment. Both the Legislative Council and
the Assembly had, for the first time in
their history, a woman member.
Tasmania was the fourth State to hold
a 1959 election. The first election under
a new Electoral Act designed to avoid
deadlocks it rather perversely provided a
deadlock, returning 17 Labor members,
16 Liberals and two Independents.
Premier Reece is thus once more leading
a minority Labor Government.
In Victoria the Bolte Government has
had an argumentative year, with a few
tactical defeats, but is still able to claim
—and does claim at every opportunity—
that Victoria is attracting more migrants
and more new industries and capital than
any other State. The first claim is indis-
putable ; the second is always good for
a bite from the other side of the Murray.
Queensland, of course, claims 1959
as its own, and with a centenary to cele-
brate and Princess Alexandra to lend the
festivities her youthful charm no one
begrudges it the honor. Queensland had
no election, but there was a redistribu-
tion of electorates in preparation for next
year’s. This evoked from Labor
anguished howls which were an echo of
those drawn from their opponents (then
in Opposition) by Labor’s earlier redistri-
butions. To Opposition-leader Duggan’s
complaint, Premier Nicklin replied, “You
have a chance under the bill. We had
none under yours.” Whether he was
right 1960 will perhaps be able to show.
That will be only one of the many
unfinished jobs passed on to it by 1959.


SPORTING NOTIONS
YOUR SHOUT!
AND ITS
RED MILE RUM.
At Caulfield
It looks as if the two-year-
old filly Elated is a good deal
better than average. Last
Saturday week she showed a
speedy pair of heels to a field
of fillies at Moonee Valley,
and she was even more im-
pressive in leading from go to
whoa in the five-furlongs
Carnegie Stakes at Caulfield.
She was ridden again by young
Ray Hill, who had his first
metropolitan win with her the
previous week, but the lad had
better forget looking over his
shoulder, as he did two or
three times in the straight on
Saturday. Elated is by Or-
goglio from Rarcamba, dam
of Fiero, who won a race in
Melbourne last season. Rar-
camba, winner of a couple of
races in Adelaide, is a half-
sister to Denhoti, who won the
V.A.T.C. Debutant Stakes in
1946.

Nobody could begrudge
King Dassie his win in the
five-furlongs Holiday Stakes
for two-year-old colts and
geldings. Two starts back the
chestnut Coronation Boy geld-
ing had all-but beaten Aly
Khan. He had started at 100
to 1 that day, and on the
strength of that good run was a
6-to-4 favorite at the Valley
last Saturday week, but missed
the start and put up a great
performance to run third be-
hind Gay Invader. At Caulfield
King Dassie started from the
outside barrier of 16 runners,
but this time dashed out of
the stalls to lead immediately.
He had an interesting battle
from there on with Milverton,
but over the last little bit came
away to win well. Bred in
South Australia, he is out of
Princess Dassie. Milverton,
who mixed it with the best of
them in the spring, will be im-
proved by the run and may
win the Stradbroke Stakes on
New Year’s Day.
Prince Dahomey, mentioned
here as a Bagot Handicap
chance after his win in the
Heath Handicap at Caulfield
a couple of weeks ago, looks
like starting favorite for that
race following his excellent win
in the 12-furlongs Hopetoun
Handicap. This double success
is easily the best patch of form
the five-year-old has so far
shown. It was an f.a.q. field
of summer handicappers in the
Hopetoun, and he beat them
as he liked. He was very well
ridden by Lyle Harbridge, who
recently completed his appren-
ticeship with Bendigo trainer
George Daniel. Harbridge,
who has'ridden eight winners
in Melbourne this season, is
being spoken of as a jockey
with a rich future. Roy Bones

Pakenham mentor Ray
Webster.
Not even a Mothers’ Club
tea-party is more receptive to
rumors than a racecourse,
which is the only possible
explanation for the extra-
ordinary odds bet against
Prince Lea in the Christmas
Handicap. Prince Lea beat the
great Noholme in the Caulfield
Guineas last spring, which puts;
him way above the class he
met on Saturday, but he was
racing first-up from a two-
months’ break, and rumor had
it that he was “a bit fat,” so
he drifted from threes to
sevens before shortening a
point. He took second possie
behind Proponder to the
straight-entrance, where he shot
to the lead, and, although feel-
ing the strain a bit over the
last hundred yards, hung on to
beat Planetoid. He is a high-
class colt, and most people will
want to back him in next
Friday’s Standish Handicap.
C. Brock, W. Fraser and W.
Schier, all connected with
hotels, have had a happy
association as racehorse owners.
They raced Tavua, who won
his share of handicaps in Mel-
bourne, and who won the
Launceston Cup in 1957, and
now they have former Sydney
galloper King of Trumps, with
whom they have now won three
races, including last Saturday’s
mile Malvern Handicap. They
are going to try to win their
second Launceston Cup with
him, and he’s just the type for
that race, which will be run
in February.
These days no unusual
interest is taken in the Stan-
dish and Bagot double run on.
New Year’s Day ; it isn’t so
long since bookmakers issued
charts on the double weeks
ahead. It is a pity that the
Bagot, in particular, has
become of so little importance.
The race was instituted in
1884 in memory of R. C. Bagot,
first secretary to the V.R.C.
He did more for Fleming-
ton and the good of Melbourne
racing than any man who ever
lived, and he deserves a more
important race to commemor-
ate his efforts.

Sydney Racing
Winner of 16 races at from
six to 12 furlongs, Gay Satin
closed her racing career —
rather sadly for trainer Sid
Nicholls, who called her
Biddy—when she broke-down
about half-a-mile from the
finish of the A.J.C. Summer
Cup at Randwick last Satur-
day. She started a short-priced
favorite, and R. George
had started to move her for-
ward from the centre of the
field, with visions of landing
the £2600 mile-and-a-half,
when she went in the shoulder
and was taken from the track
in the course ambulance. She
had only lately found her early
fine form. She had been raced
on lease by Len Burke and the
lease had about seven months
to run, but it had been intended
to make the Summer Cup her
last race.
The Cup went to Nadar
Shah, beating Brisbane’s Rin
Tin by half-a-length, with Dual
Copy third, in average time
for the race, 2.31 f. It was
Nadar Shah’s first win in open
company. He was handi-
capped on the limit (7.4), but
carried 11b. over for G. Pod-
more. A promising young
stayer, Nadar Shah is by Royal
Empire (Fr.), who won and
was placed over long distances
in England and France and
has sired other Australian
stayers. Belle Femme, dam of
the Cup winner, is by Beau-
partir from Newsgirl by
Magpie (imp.) from Carrah by
Charlemagne II (imp.), so
there's good staying back-
ground.

In the December Stakes, won
by Gemini Prince, with Alpen-
stock second, two-year-old filly
Minikin gained £l5O towards
her feed-bill by running a
remote 12-lengths third. The
winner dominated the evens
at fours-on, and a fourth prize
of £5O went begging. Gemini
Prince has won at three of his
four starts, and he looked a
picture as he paraded before
the start of the Stakes.
Another of the remarkably
speedy Star Kingdom (imp.)
colts, he brought 4000gns. as a
yearling, and is trained by
M. McCarten for Harry
Tancred and *Miss Mary
Tancred.
• • •
Two-year-old Pan II (Fr.)
gelding Bodumba has made a


good start, with two outings
for a third to Australian Star
at Rosehill and a win in the
Juvenile Maiden on Summer
Cup day. It was a blanket-
finish between the placegetters:
Trigon Wood a head away
second, Fair Lord half-a-head
away third, and Malihina a
close fourth. Bodumba, who
has led the field at each of his
outings, is trained at Rand-
wick by Frank Dalton for
G. W. Cobcroft. His dam,
Vistaed, was a smart galloper.
Bodumba could soon repeat
the performance in better
company, and runner - up
Trigon Wood, a newcomer,
shouldn’t be long in winning.
He is among the first crop of
the Birdwoods, and is from
Ann Trigo by Andrea (imp.).
With his North Row, winner
of the 10-furlongs Novice on
Cup day, owner-trainer E. T.
(Tim) O’Sullivan has an Eng-
lish horse who looks to have
a bright future. He had also
won in Maiden company at
Randwick a week earlier, and
on Saturday Sellwood got him
home a clear winner, though
he had to overcome some
slight difficulties near the finish.

Producing a horse ready to
win first-up after an absence
from racing of nearly five
months is always pretty good
going, but T. J. Smith had
given Merry Polly sound trials
before starting her in the
seven-furlongs Mersey Handi-
cap for three-year-old fillies.
Merry Polly, who hasn’t done
much racing, won at Randwick
on August 3 in similar com-
pany, then was put aside for
a spell. Raced by H. F. Porter,
she’s a Squander Bug (imp.)
filly from Merry Frau by
Happy Knight (E.), and is
related to The Night Patrol
(imp.), Heroic and Magpie
(imp.).
When topweight Gay Port
led practically all the way
under his 9.12 burden (7.7
limit) to win the Chisholm
Handicap he made his record
10 wins from 19 starts. Just
before the race a sharp down-
pour caused bookmakers to
ease Gay Port’s price in favor
of Chipperfield, but, if any-
thing, the rain improved the
going and actually helped the
topweight. Later on Plymouth
ran the final race over one
mile in 1.36 f, smart going for
a Welter.
Main attraction on Tatter-
sail’s Club programme next
Friday (January 1), the 12-
furlongs £2150 Cup dates back
to the 1860’s. At this time
of the year most of the best
stayers are resting after the
spring round, but the club has
had quite a number of top-
class horses among its Cup
winners, including, in the past
three seasons, Caesar, Monte
Carlo and Empire Link, each
with 9st. Dewar’s 2.30 in
1942 is a time-performance
that will take beating.
* Jf!
Eagle Farm’s E. L. Ramsay
Handicap for two-year-olds on
Saturday was easily won by
Changi Rose, a filly by Singa-
pore Road (Fr.) from Lessons
“Crikey! What bait are you using?”
by School Tie (imp.) from
Gaterina (imp.) by Prince
Galahad. Lessons is a half-
sister to Invictus, winner of the
A.J.C. Summer Cup, and to
High Law’s dam, Statute. High
Law’s wins included the A.J.C.
Epsom. The Canning Downs
Maiden, also fo'r two-year-olds,
went to Jungle Court, a colt
by Jungle King (imp.) from
Lady Courtcraft by Courtcraft
(N.Z.) from Lady Terentia by
Terentia. He is closely related
to Lough Neagh.

lowed the A.J.C.’s lead. Prin-
cipal winners honored at this

“P.0.M.C.”: Most exciting
day in my racing memory was
when my father held Cagou
as second leg of a biggish
double in 1913, and Cagou
duly landed the A.J.C. Metro-
politan. Though only 13 at the
time, I date my passion for
racing from that auspicious
day. Four years later, when
I was at Warrnambool (Vic.),
Cagou again appeared as a
Metropolitan entrant. Mainly
for sentimental reasons, I
backed him pre-post and the
fine old stayer repeated
his win. In fact, of all big
races in Australia, the Metrop.
has been outstandingly lucky
for me. Except for 1921,
when I was in Queensland, I
have seen the race every year
since 1920 and have backed
the winner at least 15 times ;
including Strength at 50’s in
1931.

“Postscript”: Sydney
stewards’ rulings are hard to
follow at times. On Villiers
Stakes day at Randwick they
warned a hoop that “they
expected jockeys at least to
ride their mounts out hands
and heels over the concluding
stages of races.” The stipes
should make this “riding-out”
injunction clearer. Otherwise,
in future, many more nags that
could at least fill minor places
on Sydney tracks won’t.
Cricket Records
Neil Harvey has now set
a record for Tests played by
an Australian cricketer —the
second against India was his
62nd Test.
Before these series against
Pakistan and India Syd
Gregory held the record for
the number of Tests by an
Australian, with 58 between
1890 and 1912. Ray Lindwall
has also passed Gregory's
record— T the third Test against
Pakistan being his 59th. Brad-
man played in 51 Tests.
Of course the star Test man
today has more chance of
setting Test-playing records,
more countries now playing
Test cricket than in Syd
Gregory’s time.

“Zorok”: W.A. opening
batsman Bob Simpson is cer-
tainly in top form (B.
23/12/’59). He followed his
236 not-out against N.S.W.
with 230 - not-out against
Queensland. As far as I can
discover, this is the first time
a batsman - has made two
double-centuries in successive
Shield games. Don’t think
even Bradman did it. Certainly
there would not have been
uncompleted 200’s before. In
January, 1954, in successive
games, “Slasher” Mackay hit
223 against Victoria and 198
against W.A. Simpson’s Shield
average after his 230 not-out
was 564!
••* • •
“Kabara”: A last-wicket
stand of 107 in a recent game
in the Prahran and Southern
Districts Association (Vic.)
must have set at least one
record for any grade of cricket
—a stand of over 100 in which
one batsman does not make
a run. When A.M.P. were
9-49 against Prahran Pafs,
second-wicket batsman Ken
Mullens was 25 not-out. He
then batted for nearly two
hours with Peter Wertheimer,
and was 124 not-out when
Wertheimer went for a duck.
The other eight runs in the
partnership came from old
reliable sundries.
“Veryl”: The cricketing
Harveys have a second-
generation member who may
make a mark in the game.
He is 18-year-old Graham
Harvey, son of Mervyn and
nephew of Neil. Opening the
innings for V.C.A. Colts v.
Combined Public and High
Schools in a game played a
week or two before Christmas,
Harvey made a neat 72 before
being run-out. His father,
Merv, eldest of the Harveys,
played in the fourth 1946-47
Test against England. Some

thought he could well have
been picked for Australia

batting line-up.
“K.R. - ’: Strange that some very
competent grade-cricketers play for
years and never receive higher
honors. Back in the ’thirties Rand-
wick’s big left-hand opening bats-
man Max Ward made runs con-
sistently—he was one of three
brothers in the side, one of whom,
Alan, was also a Rugby Union
international. At Coogee Oval 1
once saw him, in making, I think,
92, paste Bill O’Reilly all round
the ground. Today, to name a
couple, there are veteran Balmain
opener Angus Mackinnon (a bit
old now, perhaps, though still a
most reliable b'atsman) and Manly
all-rounder Eddie Robinson, who
couldn’t do very much more than
he does do match after match, yet
has never caught the State selectors'

“Tom”: Former Victorian
Test cricketers lan Johnson,
Bill Johnston and Doug Ring
will be the first to receive pay-

Cricket Association’s players’

net £1450, Johnston £1290,
Ring £770. The provident-
fund, started by the V.C.A.
in the 1956-57 season, is
unique in the cricketing world.
The purpose behind it is to
reward cricketers who have
put much into the game, but
have not benefited from a
testimonial match.
“Cricketer”: A note from a
couple of the chaps with our
touring team mentions an
aspect that you don’t get in the
reports —how grateful they all
are for the help given by a
couple of medicos who are
travelling with the side. Minor
ailments, mostly caused by
wrong kinds of food, have
been quickly cleared. For
some time the whole team
lived on a diet that mainly
consisted of fish and eggs, as
a safety-measure!

“Slip-glance”: Mention here
of Allan Young recalls that he
gave me an outstanding
memory of cricket. It was
Queensland v. the Second
A.I.F. team, in ’45 or ’46.
Young was batting; Pepper
bowling. I’d say, with-
out having put the tape on
either, that Pepper was about
6ft. 2in., Young only bantam-
size. It was a case of David
and Goliath in reverse the
big bloke was hurling down
the shots. The difference in
sizes- was noticeable; some
lady spectators said it wasn’t
fair. Young stepped out of
his crease, timed things well,
hit with all his minus weight
behind it, and the ball soared
over the sightboard into the
outer for a glorious six. The
ladies settled back in hopes of
the little bloke doing it again.

Other Sports
“Sam” : Contrary to popu-
lar Australian Rugby League
belief, the code is far from
being predominantly profes-
sional in England. Since
War II amateur League has
been spreading in Southern
England, where, there are no
professional clubs. The code
has also made encouraging
advances in primary, commer-
cial and technical schools, and,
as well, a lot of amateur Rugby
League is played in the North.
In fact, J. R. Jones’s Encyclo-
pedia of Rugby Football gives
the number of amateur Rugby
League clubs in England as
“over 700, as against the 30
professional clubs who com-
pete in the Rugby League
Championship.”

Following tradition, and
fearing to embarrass the South
African Rugby Union, the
N.Z. Union decided against
including Maoris in the 1960
All Black touring-team. A
change may now be on the
way. At a meeting of the
International Olympic * Com-
mittee Reginald Honey (South
Africa) stated that there were
lOy-million colored men in his
country, and that they had
started to show an interest in
the Olympics. As a result, the
South African Olympic Com-
mittee had decided that it
would not object to any
colored athlete representing
South Africa if he reached the
standard. Should a colored
champion arise he would be

“Traveller”: One of the
most remarkable developments
in sport in the last few years
has been the forward march
of Rugby Union. It’s now the
third most-popular ball-game
in the world ; is played in 57
countries. Only Soccer and
tennis head it in popularity as
a playing sport. A significant
feature of its growth has been
its “adoption” in Iron Curtain
countries by .the education
authorities. In Czechoslovakia,
for example, it is on school-
sport curricula as a team-game
that must be played. On a
recent tour of Europe I found
that the Red leaders regarded
Rugby Union as being an ideal
game to develop the physical
and mental capacities of young
men to the highest degree—a
fair sort of tribute to a sport
that was once regarded by the
totalitarian countries as being
the product of snobbery and
class - distinction. Australian
Union authorities, looking well
ahead, are working with
British and other Union
authorities to try to frame a
programme for a football-
tour that will encompass the
world.

“Sportite": A note or two
from Rome: There will be
824 officials controlling the 17
sports at the coming Olympics ;
about 300 of them will be from
“foreign” countries . . . Dozens
of athletes will become post-
competition “guinea-pigs” in
the cause of medical science.
Rome’s organising-committee
has appointed a special medical
board to meet the sport medi-
coes who will accompany the
teams. Two Australian doctors
will attend, having offered their
services. Plan is to prepare a
scientific valuation of athletes
by drawing-up a basal bio-
psychic chart . . . When the
Games are over, the people of
Rome city will have five full-
scale swimming-pools, all built
for the competitions and train-
ing.

“Tennisite”: Firms anxious
to associate sport with pro-
motional enterprises are turn-
ing in solid fashion to tennis
as a valuable aid in getting
their products off the shelves.
Amateur tennis in N.S.W. and
Victoria has recently received
grants totalling £BOOO for the
staging of tournaments for
teenagers in Melbourne and
Sydney.

“Athlete”: With its victory
this year Western Suburbs
(Sydney) Amateur Athletic
Club has now won the annual
inter-club premiership 21 times
since 1925. The remarkable
record has not been based
solely on brilliant individual
performers. A fine team-spirit
prevails among members, who
turn out for training and com-
petition rain, hail or shine.
“Golfer”: After staging 13
major golfing tournaments
since 1947, Ampol Petroleum,
Ltd., has withdrawn from
further sponsorship of tourna-
ments in capital cities. The
decision will seriously affect
Australian professionals
more than £40,000 has been
made available for competition
in the tournaments. Ampol
won’t completely disappear
from promotion, however. It
will conduct a series of smaller
tournaments in a country
circuit.

“H.F.L.”: Touching on a
par. here about a chap who
went along twice to see
the filming of the Burns-
Johnson fight and reckoned
“Burns put up a better fight on
the second night,” I saw what
was supposed to be the
original filming, but some
months later 1 again saw the
film-version, and Burns did
seem to put up a better fight.
I was informed that pieces of
the original film were cut out,
giving Burns a better showing,
which suited the box-office.

“Olympus”: The inter-
national Olympic Committee
has been advised of a stupen-
dous plan by Tokyo, host city,
to televise the 1964 Olympic
Games. The scheme, esti-
mated at present to cost
60,000,000 dollars, envisages
linking Tokyo to Europe and
America. After months of
investigation the Japanese
Broadcasting Association has
produced a draft-scheme for
connecting Tokyo with Europe
through South-east Asia; for
America, the transmission-
channel will go through the
Aleutian Islands. Rom e’s

UNCABLED
ADDITION S
LABOR CONFERENCE AT BLACKPOOL
Tn Britain as in Australia the
■*- charge is being made against
the Labor party that it is living
in the past and- much of the
British press-comment on the
Blackpool conference was de-
voted to this theme. Man-
chester “Guardian” considers
that the proper verdict is “not
proven,” as on the evidence
presented by the party itself
“it can neither be acquitted
nor found guilty”:
“What Mr. Gaitskell
sought must appear, to
outsiders, to be elementary
—that the party - constitution
should be brought up to date.
Its only specific statement of
essentials, he said, concerns
‘the common ownership of the
means of production, distribu-
tion, and exchange.’ It makes
no reference at all to colonial
freedom, race relations, dis-
armament, full employment, or
planning. Therefore he wants
it rewritten. To most people
this may be simple common-
sense : but to sorpe at the
conference it was accursed.
“The counter-attack was on
the line that common owner-
ship must be kept as the party’s
guiding-light. Had it prevailed
the only conclusion would have
been that the Labor party
intended to put itself slowly
to death. It did not prevail,
however, although given much
vocal support....
“The candidate for South
Kensington (age 27) admitted
that young people were turning
to the Liberals and Conserva-
tives, but argued that they could
be won back by an appeal
to social conscience. The
candidate for Putney (age 31)
mentioned that nationalisation
would not become more popu-
lar as more electors became
middle-class, and he com-
plained of class-warfare within
the Labor party.
“Mr. Wedgwood Benn (age
34) put the point that by 1964
there will be voters to whom the
names of Attlee and Stalin —
even Churchill —will mean
little or nothing, and that Labor
must consider what these people
will regard as important. It
will not be nationalisation, but
it may well be the bomb, the
freedom of Africans, and the
spread of . commercialism in
our lives.
“If Labor is ready to accept
such ideas, following Mr. Gait-
skell’s lead, it can arrest its
own decay. If not, then noth-
ing but utter incompetence on
the Conservative side can take
it back to office.”
To the “Daily Mail” it
seems that Gaitskell wants to
build up a new modern-minded
Opposition capable of forming
an alternative Government,
and that Aneurin Bevan may
help him, but that to do it
the “two avowed Socialists
must kill British Socialism”:
“His [Gaitskell’s] one chance
of ever winning an election is
to rid his party of its old-
fashioned ideas. It must finally
—London “News Chronicle .”
“TO ROME—OR TO ROAM?”
bury Keir Hardie and the cloth-
cap.
“Mr. Gaitskell indicated his
policy in a speech as clever
as it was courageous. With-
out actually trampling on
the ark of the covenant he
hinted that he must have room
to reshape it, and three years
for the job. With Bevan at
his elbow he could do it.
“But let not either imagine
that they could retain a united
party. Mr. Cousins will have
none of it, nor will Mrs.
Castle, the party chairman, or
the Footites.
“Mr. Gaitskell can count on
the bulk of trade-union sup-
port. He may have calculated
that the extremists he is certain
to lose will be more than
compensated by the moderates
he hopes to gain. But it will
be tough going.”
“Sunday Times” says that
along with Karl Marx and other
unwanted objects Gaitskell has
tossed the Webbs and Cole out
of the window and that what
is left can be called Socialism
“only by virtue of hereditary
title.” It asks wherein lies
the basic contrast with pro-
gressive modern Conservatism
and decides that it is in “the
last remaining item in the
Gaitskell creed, the classless
society”:
“Labor is doomed to
frustration if it identifies itself
with one class ; for that class
is shrinking and is moreover
fermenting with ambition to rise
to another class. There is noth-
ing unhealthy in this.
“Mr. Gaitskell is barking up
a wrong tree, for sure, if he
thinks the objective of a class-
less society is a vote-getter.
Nothing is dearer to the heart
of the millions than class-differ-
entiation. It is one of the most
potent yeasts in the economic
process and it is, of course,
rife under Socialism wherever,
as in Russia, this ideology has
been radically applied.
“Politics, in any case, is less
concerned with principles of
this general kind, which any-
one can adopt, than with the
practical problems of pursu-
ing them—with means rather
than ends, to use Mr. Gaitskell’s
own mode of thought. He tried
to demote traditional Socialism
by labelling it ‘means,’ which
of course would be adjusted
to suit circumstances. TTiis is
largely a matter of termin-
ology : the plain man asks,
not ‘where do you believe the
frontier between the public and
private sectors of the economy
should be drawn,’ but ‘what are
you going to do about national-
isation?’ And the answer he
gets from the Labor summit —
it may be a wise one —is ‘We
don't know just now.’ Mr.
Gaitskell spoke several thou-
sand words at Blackpool: not
one of them was steel.”
The “Daily Herald” regrets
that no clear lead as to the
direction of future policy was
given by the conference. It
feels that the proceedings
stopped just short of disaster:
“But the movement is left
with three statements of policy
—not altogether different, cer-
tainly not completely exclusive,
but not carrying the same
emphasis.
“Mr. Gaitskell was speaking
for himself. Mr. Bevan was
speaking for himself. Mrs.
Castle was speaking for herself.
Who was speaking for the
party?
“In Mr. Gaitskell’s view, two
or three years hence is time
enough to start drawing-up a
new policy in detail.
“But we cannot wait that
time for the confusion of the
issue of public ownership to be
resolved.
“Behind the confusion there
is an immense amount of
common ground. So much
common ground that a rea-
soned, clear and up-to-date
approach on where the party
can stand is perfectly possible.
“But the new executive must
get down to the job of formu-
lating that approach now.
“Nothing would be more
disastrous than to muddle
along until next year’s con-
ference.
“And, while the executive
works on that, it is for Labor
M.P.s to go powerfully into
attack on the Tory Govern-
ment.
“The goal is a Labor Gov-
ernment, social justice, and
a nation in control of its
own economic destiny. Every
ounce of energy is needed for
that. There should be none
to spare for feuding.”
Prisoners at Spandau
An appeal by his lawyer for
the release of German
war-criminal Rudolf Hess
brought this comment from
the Manchester “Guardian”:
“Rudolf Hess, once Hitler’s
deputy and now serving a life-
sentence, is one of the three
almost forgotten men kept in
Spandau prison. (The other
two, Schirach and Speer, are
serving sentences of twenty
years.)

estimated to be well over
£60,000 a year. Such gro-
tesque expenditure might still
be justifiable if their continued
detention were felt to serve the
cause of justice, or to be essen-
tial for political reasons.
“On the score of justice, it
is true that no punishment
meted out to these men can
ever atone for the terrible
crimes of which they were the
authors. Nor, on their record,
have they any claim to mercy.
The most moving appeals for
their release have come from
some of their victims. More-
over, Hess, who has been in
captivity since 1941, is prob-
ably schizophrenic. The minds
of the other two were said to
be almost completely blank
and beyond caring. The
nature of their confinement
makes it improbable that these
are simulated symptoms.
“They ought to be released,
not because they have any
claim on our mercy, but in
the name of our own principles
of justice and humanity.”
Oil from the Sahara
VX7hile political attention is
*" focused on President de
Gaulle’s plans to test a French
nuclear bomb in the Sahara,
an event of far more signi-
ficance is the completion of
the 400-mile pipeline connect-
ing the Saharan oilfields with
t h e Mediterranean. The
“Daily Telegraph” comments
that if ever a strike deserved
the adjective lucky it was
France’s discovery of oil in
the Sahara, coming as it did
just at the time when Nasser
was seizing the Suez Canal.
However, it warns that there
may be a small fly in the
petroleum-jelly:
“The first oil has begun to
flow through the pipeline at
a moment when, as a result
of President de Gaulle’s initia-
tive, the prospects of peace and
a political settlement in
Algeria look more encouraging
than they have ever been. In
three years, if all goes well,
France should be getting
enough Saharan oil to satisfy
her domestic needs. But Pro-
vidence has presented this
bounty with strings attached.
“Middle East Governments,
so far from threatening supplies
to the West, are urging the
companies to greater output
from existing fields and trying
to hasten the exploitation of
others still untapped. More-
over, Middle East crude enjoys
a natural advantage in that its
composition most nearly fits
the pattern of European
demand for heavy-fuel and
gas-oils, whereas the light
Saharan oil will add to the
surplus of petrol.
“Even the advantage of near-
ness to Europe, which the
Saharan fields now possess,
may soon be challenged by
those recently discovered in
Libya. Oil - consumption is
indeed increasing everywhere,
but not as fast as the potentiali-
ties of production. Complex
adjustments and perhaps
some painful ones —will be
—"Die Welt ” (Germany).
“ALWAYS THESE TROUBLESOME EASTERNERS!"
necessary if France is to find
markets for the rich promise
of the Sahara.”
The Edinburgh “Scotsman”
also has misgivings about the
marketing of oil from the new
field:
“In a few years, if the
exploitation of Saharan oil goes
according to plan, France will
be among the top half-dozen
oil-producing countries in the
world. The reserves of oil are
reliably estimated to be enor-
mous, and by 1963 France is
expected to become a net
exporter. Though the demand
for oil goes on increasing, the
smooth expansion of the
market may not be simple.
“The oil from Hassi Mes-
saoud is the lightest in the
world, with a high petrol-
content and little sulphur ; it
can be used direct in diesel-
engines. Though it has the
commercial advantage of
proximity to Europe, France’s
main needs are met by the
heavier kinds of oil from the
Middle East. The best market
for Saharan oil would be not
France but the United States.
“If the world-market were
large enough and unrestricted
enough, Saharan and Middle
East oil might tend to be
complementary rather than
competitive. As it is, they
are almost certainly going to
compete.”
“New York Times” calls for
consultation before competi-
tion gets too keen :
“When French Premier Debre
turned a valve at an oil-pump-
ing station in the Sahara he
signalised a development which
is bound to have important
political and economic reper-
cussions on France, on Europe,
on the Middle East and
especially on Algeria, now
under debate in the United
Nations.
“This new oil-supply, added
to other oil-strikes in Africa,
as in Libya, will make all
Europe less dependent on
Middle Eastern oil and the
Suez Canal. Nasser has the
Suez Canal, but the oil is
escaping him. For political
reasons the free world will and
must continue buying Middle
Eastern oil, but it can be
more selective and resist more
effectively any exorbitant
demands by Arab leaders.
“What the new supply will
do to the world’s oil-markets
remains to be seen. But with
oil-reserves and production
growing faster than consump-
tion, and with warnings of
new price-wars already in the
air, it would seem that the
time has come for the free
nations to get together on a
world oil-policy that would
avert ruinous competition.”
Ike in Asia
HPhe warm reception accorded
President Eisenhower in
India and Pakistan has been
applauded by the press of the
United Kingdom as heralding
better relations between
America and Asia. It is
accepted that this is a natural
corollary to Chinese aggression
in Tibet and on India’s
northern frontiers. Thus,
Manchester “Guardian”:
“Whatever else President
Eisenhower's visit to India
may achieve, it seems likely
in the public mind to mark a
double discovery—an Ameri-
can discovery of India and
an Indian discovery of
America. Vast cheering
crowds, such as almost engulfed
the President on Wednesday,
may have only the vaguest of
motives for their behavior.
Yet politicians can seldom
help being influenced by them.
Indians’ welcome for anyone
they feel means them well has
impressed before.
“True, the crowds once
turned out for Mr. Khrush-
chev, Marshal Bulganin and
the ‘Five Principles’ of co-
existence, as they have now
for Mr. Eisenhower. But
things have changed since
then. When the President
speaks of America’s having
had to face ‘a long series of
harsh alarms' from places both
near and far, his audience can
hear the echo from the Hima-
layas.
“The message is all the more
likely to be effective because,
as Indians have woken up to
the Chinese danger, America
has given up lecturing them
on the immorality of neutral-
ism, and has instead taken up
an attitude of cautious sym-
pathy. President Eisenhower’s
call for a ‘Five-year or Fifty-
year Plan against mistrust and
misgiving and fixation on the
wrongs of the past’ may be
vague, but it is what Indians
want to hear, and it will help
to alter decisively the image


of America which they carry
in their minds.
“There remains the large
task of organising aid from the
advanced to the poorer coun-
tries, with America taking a
leading but not the sole part.
Whatever other countries may
do, this will have to be ex-
pounded first to the American
public: to this end, the Presi-
dent’s reception in Delhi
should be a help.”
The “News Chronicle” sees)
a tremendous gain for demo-
cracy and peace in the fact
that sympathy has replaced
suspicion in the relations be-
tween “the world’s strongest
and the world’s largest
democracies”:
“Only a few months ago
the United States was regarded
in India as a danger to peace
and as an imperialist Power.
Today she is. recognised as the
champion of international
order and the friend of the
poor nations whose people live
in hunger.
“President Eisenhower’s per-
sonal interest in India has
helped. American financial
aid has not gone unhoticed.
But the main driving-force
behind the new feeling of
friendship is the threat of
China and the determination
of Washington to seek peace
through disarmament as ex-
pressed in the President’s
speech to the Indian Parlia-
ment.
“In fact, when the marigold-
petals of welcome have faded,
very large differences of policy
will still be seen to divide
Delhi from the White House.
India clings to military isola-
tionism. America is deter-
mined to strengthen her
alliances. Distrust of China
is mutual, but India has far
more confidence in Mr.
Khrushchev’s intentions than
have the Americans.
“These differences are im-
portant. But President Eisen-
hower, powerfully aided by the
follies of Peking, has suc-
ceeded in winning the confi-
dence of India. This is a
heartening advance.”
The “Daily Telegraph” is
cautious but hopeful:
“So many peoples all over
the world have shown their
liking for Ike that it is easy
enough to pass over the Presi-
dent’s tumultuous reception in
India as just one more example
of the current universal craze.
The Indian crowds, after all,
are notoriously demonstrative ;
nor are they usually particu-
larly discriminating on whom
they lavish their myriad atten-
tio n s. Sceptics, therefore,
would not need to search far
to find good reasons to mini-
mise the importance of the
President’s visit. Indeed, Parlia-
ment’s coolness to his speech
was in marked contrast to the
warmth outside.
“Yet this may be one of
those not so rare occasions
when the sceptics are thunder-
ingly wrong. For it is by no
means impossible that Mr.
Eisenhower’s visit, coming at
a moment of great heart-
searching in India, has served
to induce a moment of truth
in Indian-American relations,

when all the falsehoods, sus-
picions, muddled thoughts are
peeled away, disclosing an
overwhelming community of
interest which, once glimpsed,
will not easily be forgotten.
“It was probably inevitable
that India, in the full flush of
post-colonial sensitivity, should
fear that association with the
America of that period might
involve her unnecessarily in
troubles which were little to
do with Asia. It may well be,
however, that these particular
causes for coolness are now in
process of profound modifica-
tion. Mr. Eisenhower’s visit
in itself reflects an increased
American interest in Asian
affairs. That this should co-
incide with a vastly increased
realisation in India of the
Chinese menace cannot fail also
to make such American interest
genuinely welcome.
“The United States today is
anxiously searching for new
vistas on which to feed her
imagination and new goals on
which to set her heart. During
the past decade anti-American-
ism has damped her ardor and
frustrated her idealism. It
may not be too fanciful to
hope that the welcoming roar
of the Indian crowds will once
again set free this great pent-up
flood of human generosity and
idealism which still remains
the best hope of mankind in
the 20th century.”
Khrushchev
in Hungary
New Zealander Sir
* * Leslie Munro raised the
Hungarian question at U.N.
early this month he suggested
that Khrushchev appeared to
agree with the findings of the
1957 report of the U.N. Com-
mission. Commenting on this,
the Edinburgh “Scotsman”
says:
“Khrushchev last week
admitted all the essential facts
about the causes of the rising
and about the Russian inter-
vention in a speech in Hun-
gary, brushing aside the fictions
which have been assiduously
wrapped round it by the
Kadar regime and other Com-
munist sources.
“The Hungarian represen-
tative maintains, of course, that
the United Nations is not
competent to intervene in what
he asserts are internal affairs.
But it is at least satisfactory
that he is taking part in the
debate.
“Russia and Hungary are
more susceptible to the
influence of world opinion
than China —who is not a
member of the United Nations
—in the matter of Tibet. It
is possible that assiduous
protests from Western writers
have been partly responsible
for the commutation of death-
sentences on Hungarian
writers. But apart from the
shocking execution of Nagy
and Maleter last year, in
defiance of earlier promises
and assurances, execution of
leading participants in the ris-
ing continued until last
summer and may have gone
on still more recently.
“If things are in general
better in Hungary by compari-
son with the days of Rakosi,
that is not saying very much,
and it seems essential that the
pressure of opinion should be
maintained.”
New York “Herald Tribune”
feels that the Russian Premier
was “even more voluble than
usual” during his visit to
Hungary and it finds his refer-
ence to the Soviet decision to
intervene in Hungary “perhaps
the most revealing of all his
utterances”:
“As is his wont, Mr. Khrush-
chev boasted of Communism's
strength:—its armaments, its
moon-rockets, its will to win.
But when he told the Hun-
garian workers how and why
he decided to move the tanks
in to crush their efforts to
regain freedom, this boastful-
ness vanished. He did not
ascribe the Hungarian revolu-
tion to the capitalists (although
he pictured them as drooling
over the prospect of a success-
ful revolt against the pro-
Soviet regime). Rather, he
blamed it on the excesses of
the Stalinist leaders of Hun-
garian Communism.
“Moreover, he indicated that
there had been tremors in the
Kremlin over the prospect of
shooting down Hungarian
workers, who had taken Mr.
Khrushchev’s own attacks
upon Stalinism too seriously.

With the coming of the New Year we enter
another decade in this century of rich achievement.
Looking back, as we customarily do at this
turning time, we can say that the world seems
closer to international understanding than when
1959 began. That is one reason for regarding the
old year kindly. And for Australia it has been,
in general, a year of prosperity and progress.
But the past is spent and the future is in credit
to be drawn upon. How well will we use it?
It is easy to go along accepting life as it is;
satisfied in the setting of today, and expecting that
the years as they come out of the hand of the
Eternal will be much as they are now.
The fallacy of that thinking is to be seen in
everything that is happening around us. Astonishing
advances in science and technical performance; the
spectacle of fast-increasing millions seeking a better
share of their human entitlement, the challenge to
nations to keep up with the spiritual and intellectual
standards demanded in this age—these make the
world a very different place from that in which
Australia was founded and brought to a
relative maturity.
The year we enter is charged with these
quickening forces, which will be powering even
more heavily the years to come after that again.
The voltage of life is constantly rising.
With a continent to work upon, we can be
thankful that these days have been granted us. But
the gift will need to be justified. Back through the
centuries, great civilisations have flourished and
have declined for want of the moral strength to
survive among others that rose around them.
So the thought I have —and offer—for 1960
is this: Time is precious. It is expendable. And
we owe it to ourselves to ensure that this coming
year shall be a signal year, in which we will set out
to magnify our effort for taking Australia on along
the course that Fortune has marked for us.
afraid, said the Premier, that
this would be ‘misconstrued’ —
that is, that it would be inter-
preted for what it was: the
brutal suppression of a people’s
revolt against unendurable
tyranny.
“Mr. Khrushchev seems to
have resolved this moral
dilemma in a unique way —
unique, that is, for a Com-
munist. He took comfort
from the fact that Tsar
Nicholas had allied himself
with the Emperor of Austria
in wiping out the Hungarian
Republic of 1848 —the Repub-
lic of Louis Kossuth —and in
turning over the Hungarians)
to the tender mercies of the
Austrian Gen. Haynau. This
individual, who might have
given lessons to the Com-
munists still beating down
Hungary’s craving for free-
dom, was known in England
as Gen. Hyena, and was beaten-
up in London by a mob. It
is a queer precedent for the
Communist successor to the
Romanovs to cite.”

ferring a degree of doctor of
laws on Field-Marshal Earl
Alexander of Tunis, said:
“ ‘Almost alone among the
great generals of the last war,
Lord Alexander has not written
one of those volumes of mili-
tary memoirs which have
become almost a new hazard
to peace.’
“It was once said of Count
Moltke that he knew how to
be ‘silent in seven languages.’
Yet most generals, no less than
most privates, are fond of
recalling their exploits in the
war and some, indeed, are
nothing loath to embellish
them a bit. Not even Caesar
could turn down what pre-
sumably was a very good offer.
“All the more singular, then,
is Lord Alexander, whose
citation might well have been
written in letters as golden as
silence itself.”

London “Economist”: “Sett-
ling Antarctica’s affairs will not
mean that many people sleep
more comfortably of nights,
except, of course, the ambas-
sadorial circle that bore the
burden of the Washington
talks. But it is a sensible step
forward that the Soviet Union
has agreed to put independent
inspection into practice in one
corner of the globe (the Arctic
corner will be a much more
difficult proposition). Outer
space is the next diplomatic
hurdle of this kind.”

London “Observer”: “It is
abundantly clear that the
Common Market countries are
quite unwilling to negotiate any
special trading relationships
with the Outer Seven. This
puts Britain in a difficult posi-
tion, for the assumption of the
Outer Seven agreement has
been that it would form the
basis for negotiations with the
Six, and several of Britain’s
partners in the Seven were
willing to enter only on the
assumption that negotiation
would start more or less at
once.
“The Common Market
countries, realising the signi-
ficance of America’s new
position [of increasing diffi-
culties in export markets], are
proposing extensive tariff-cuts
on trade between Europe and
America, to be negotiated at
GATT next year. If Britain
wishes to recover the initiative
in the free-trade negotiations,
she should be giving serious
consideration to the possibility
of establishing an Atlantic
Economic Community.”

New York “H e r a l d
Tribune”: “It is with no sense
of ‘I-told-you-so’ that we note
Mr. Krishna Menon’s remarks
to his political associates in
India: ‘lt is unfortunate we
trusted China.’ Krishna Menon
has been one of Red China's
most arduous defenders in his
own country and at the U.N.
His penchant for following a
devious path beneath the most
obvious evidence in this case led
him clear out on the other side.
But now he has discovered that
aggression is really aggression
and lawlessness really lawless-
ness, and he is fortunate indeed
to be still in a country where
he can say such things openly.”

in its free state. Thus, when
describing his experiences on
Agar Wynne’s station, Nerrin-
Nerrin (western Victoria), he
waxed lyrical concerning the
scenery and the innumerable
waterfowl of the area, and he
added, “That, to us, will
always be the real Australia.”
Agar Wynne, it may be
noted, added to his pastoral
and political activities a keen
interest in racing, yet he did
not succeed in persuading his
visitor to attend the Mel-
bourne Cup. “We managed,”
Doyle says, “to get out of
that, and thereby found the
St. Kilda beach deserted for
once.”
What an odd fellow was
this —a grown man who did
not consider the Melbourne
Cup gathering to represent
“the real Australia”!
'T'hese quotations of pub-
lished comments by Doyle
are taken from his book deal-
ing with the Australia-New
Zealand tour, The Wanderings
of a Spiritualist (1921). I read
this narrative when it
appeared, lost the run of it,
and have only recently
acquired a secondhand copy.
And, rather curiously, the
copy came from the library of
the late W. Farmer Whyte,
who, as editor of Brisbane
“Daily Mail” in the relevant
period, caused me to become
attached to Doyle.
In all its aspects The
Wanderings of a Spiritualist is
an informative and readable
book. It ranges widely, from
the beauty of Melbourne’s
Botanic Gardens to the Aus-
tralian code of football (“the
best of all systems”), cricket,
tennis, and the price of a
ferry-trip from Sydney Cove
to Manly then sd. and
now 2s.
Additional to numerous re-
marks on Australia’s furred
and feathered inhabitants
(slightly quoted above), there
are frequent references to the
local human fauna, not only
in the mass but individually.
In Queensland, for examplej
Doyle was impressed by the
strong character of the
Governor of the day, Sir
Matthew Nathan, and by the
alertness of the youthful
Acting-Premier, the clever but
ill-starred Jack Fihelly (“Fi-
hilly” in the book), who is
described as “an Irish Labor
leader with a remarkable
resemblance to Dan O’Connell
in his younger days.”
Among writers and artists,
Farmer Whyte and I score
matey references, and, more
notably, there are tributes to
Henry Lawson (“whose works
I have greatly admired”),
Norman Lindsay (“whom I
look upon as one of the
greatest artists of our time”),
and Leon Gellert (“a very
young poet, who promises to
be the rising man in Australia
in this, the supreme branch
of literature”).
Now, here is a sobering
side-issue:
Just after copying Doyle’s
allusion to our “very young
poet” I paused to glance at
a Sydney Sunday paper, and
there, in an article by the
same Leon Gellert now
merely one of us humble
prose-writers! —I came upon
this reference to a certain in-
cident : “It all happened 20
years ago when I was just a
foolish youngster of 50.” Alas,
Leon, it becomes very clear
that Time still ambles, trots,
and gallops, even as it did
in Shakspeare’s day!
T7ARIOUS other reflections on
* the Australian scene, from
the mind that created Sher-
lock Holmes, carry peculiar
interest at this day (nearly 40
years after they were written),
and not the least arresting are
remarks concerning the need
for population.
“Australians do not take a
big enough view of their own
destiny,” Doyle says. “They
fear immigration lest it induce
competition and pull down
prices. It is a natural atti-
tude. And yet that little fringe
of people on the edge of that
huge island can never ade-
quately handle it.”
Sympathising with Austra-
lians’ desire to “keep the
British stock as pure as pos-
sible,” he suggests that much
useful human material might
be gained from the United
States, since the American
“likes a big gamble and a
broad life with plenty of
elbow-room.” And, as a life-
long advocate of Anglo-
American friendship, “leading
in the fullness of time to some
loose form of Anglo-American
Union,” he urges that nothing
be allowed to disrupt relations
between any of the English-
speaking peoples.
Viewed in the light of later
events —the Australian-Ameri-
can alliance in World War II
and the tide of immigration
that has since swept over this
country —those remarks be-
come, if not prophetic, at
least distinctly sagacious.
Naturally, much of Doyle's
Australian book is concerned
with Spiritualism, and in this
regard special interest attaches
(for me, at any rate) to his
comments on two mediums
who functioned in Australia
during the 1920’5, namely
Charles Bailey and Susanna
Harris.
Bailey, being known as an
apport medium, and allegedly
under control of a scholarly
spirit, made a speciality of
producing (in a darkened
room) what were claimed to
be Babylonian tablets, Asiatic
birds’-nests, etc., meanwhile
delivering learned addresses.
Doyle knew that charges of
fraud had been made against
Bailey, and so put him through
rigid tests; and, although
puzzled by certain aspects of
the case, he reached the con-
clusion that Bailey was, “upon
occasion, a true medium, with
a very remarkable gift for
apports.”
With Susanna Harris, an
American voice-medium,
Doyle had four sittings in
Melbourne, and, while bear-
ing in mind that *she had no
success when tested by a
research-committee in Europe,
he declared that he had not
the faintest doubt that in each
of his four sessions he got
“true psychic results.”
T too, “sat” with both Bailey
and Mrs. Harris (in Bris-
bane), as observer for a news-
paper, and in each case I was
even more puzzled than Doyle,
and maybe rather more
sceptical.
Bailey, a commonplace type
of fellow, certainly delivered
a striking address, and in
addition he produced some in-
triguing objects ; but —well,
the feature of the occasion I
remember most clearly is an
argument which “Gossip”
McMillan, a tough old Bris-
bane journalist, had with the
manager of the performance.
Finally, after failing to get
answers to various critical
questions, “Gossip” gave
judgment: “If that’s the kind
of heaven you are promising
us,” he said, “I much prefer
the good, old-fashioned hell!”
“Well,” the manager snapped,
“that’s where you’d better
go!”
As for Susanna Harris, she
was, as Doyle notes, “a very
large lady,” with “a dash of
the mystic Red Indian blood,”
and she rather rocked me,
when an introduction was
made at the reception-room,
by gazing down and saying,
“I’m scared of noospaper-
men.”
“You’ll pardon me,
Madam,” I replied, “if I say
that you look as though you
would never be scared by any
man.”
Like Doyle, I found certain
achievements by Mrs. Harris
to be distinctly remarkable,
but, on the other hand, some
of the “results” struck me as
being plain silly. Perhaps by
chance, as “Mr. Newspaper-
man”, I got more than a fair
share of attention from “the
Other Side” during the sitting,
and, willy-nilly, I fell into a
trifle of disputation with an
airy voice figuring as “Har-
mony,” our differences of
opinion including, of all
things, the meaning of a cer-
tain word.
Maybe it was somewhat
indiscreet to argue with a
“spirit”? Anyway, I didn’t
get a chance to resume rela-
tions with the puckish “Har-
mony,’’ for I was placed on
the organisers’ black - list
through writing a critical
article regarding the perfor-
mance, including reference to
the fact that the admittance-
fees amounted to a healthy
sum.
These observations on
“mediums” are, however,
more-or-less by the way, and
are given here only because
experiences with the same
practitioners are recounted
in The Wanderings of a
Spiritualist.
What I set out to do, by
way of a centenary gesture,
was to record personal appre-
ciation of Arthur Conan
Doyle—a big man both men-
tally and physically—and to
mention, as well, his cordial
attitude towards Australia and
its people. On the whole, we
measured up pretty well when
subjected to the lens of Sher-
lock Holmes!
As indicated at the outset,
Doyle regarded Australians
generally as being “very good-
natured,” but I suspect that,
occasionally, he anticipated
the view of a later writer and
murmured to himself, “They’re
a weird mob!”

Behind the dimples, the flex-
ing, the stomach muscles like
an active anatomical chart and
the heliographing teeth I was
aware of the dead-pan evalu-
ation: Daddy-o, oh, Daddy-o,
how I could send you up!
You're a double freak, a
squarehead square, a fossil
with your dullsville old hand-
made brogues, but I dig you—
oh, I dig you, creep.
He could, he raved on, he
could drive a car, but any, and

like. He was a car-cat, yes man.
Drive! Z-e-e-o-o-oom! Here
he unconsciously mimed, trance
took him: hands and forearm
on a steering-wheel, his dimples
flattened, he slitted his eyes at
some roadway flaring under at
70, 80, 90 . . . Then he came-
to, lit-up, moved in selling
hard with a husky voice
(Dietrich, I noted) saying that
a flip—a gentleman like me —
should have a car; I was a
grool not to ; listen, Daddy-o,
he had a gasser of an idea, like
—he’d drive for' me, with
pleasure, but definite pleasure.
I must must must get a car.
Next, intensifying his dimples
and so suddenly so very off-
handedly that I heard the
gears grind, “What you doing
tonight, Mac? Dolls, huh?”
It was a try-out subtle as
evisceration. A naughty,
monkey, he looked slyer than
he thought he looked wistful
and charming.
“No,” I said, “no —er—
women.”
He registered that. He
rippled muscles at me, smiled
and smiled, tacked over me
again with miss-nothing eyes.
I exchanged jargons, “No
dolls. I’m going to get full
as a State school, whittled as
a penguin, cacko, blind sleep-
ing drunk.”
“A booze-cat, man!” He
looked at nothing on the ceil-
ing, and “By yourself, Jim?”
he said.
“By myself.” He waited
bridally for the unless he’d
like to join me. Background

muted dog-tunes for ickies —
“Moonlight and Roses?”
“Shine on, Harvest Moon?”
I let him ask. I let him
thrust himself on me. Since I
had long, ago learned to bypass
the eccentricities of the inno-
cent, to be beware of, to flee
the naked heart, I was safe
dallying here, for this was no
simon-pure innocent, this was
a shandy one, a pony-shandy
and no trouble at all. So, I
said, I’d be pleased to have a

I watched him tease up his
gilt pompador with a pink
plastic comb and breathe-on
and polish his antiqued signet-
ring. Now —now—the suit!
Therefore, the first night
back and out in the home-
town I had never drunk in was
spent drinking in vinyl chairs
on laminex table-tops with a
suit of a color and cut I had
never drunk with before,
sprayed by the dimples and
arch and ancient boyishness of
a quarter-bodgie from a Berlin
slum, a naively corrupt camp-
fringee New Australian railway-
fireman who thought that the
answer at the end of the book
was The End Justifies the
Means, and that the J use of
a car to lure dolls, chickies and
sorts was worth Time Out
from convention or normality,
was worth whatever might
occur—the off-beat, the sordid,
a gamut of distaste, recrimina-
tion, bitterness, any-bloody-
thing.
He was too young and
tainted and foreign to know
that my indifference to some
conventions yvas boredom and
vanity, and not the color he
thought; he mistook it for
tolerance, laisser-faire and any-
thing-goes. As we bumped
shoulders back to the dormi-
tory that night alternately
singing Die Dorf Musik and
wrangling patiently as father
and son about cars, it came
to me why he had seemed from
the first familiar —he was a
later but other Otto Nowak
from lsherwood’s Goodbye to
Berlin. He was a boy of the
Friedrichstrasse amusement-
joints, corruption and sim-
plicity pathetically balanced,
his trained-animal tricks too
orchidaceous for an Australian
country town, his judgments
impaired from a past in which
he had sat nibbling sugar-
wafers, a puppenjunge playing
a pick-up in a Hallesches Tor
lokal.
Although a Beautiful Friend-
ship blessed by a scarlet
M.G.’ish sort of open-topped
and souped-up car did not
develop, Kurt Schmidt and I
moved from Mister to
Christian-names to nicknames.
I liked him because I did not
like him enough to be moved
by his desires and frustrations.
There was not even a scrapheap
1929 Chevrolet in sight for
him. He could not imagine
that I could see through his
automobile bowings and
scrapings which familiarity bred
to nagging ; he could not see
that I might have pitied him
because, to him, I was a rock-
head he couldn’t drive ape, I
was as square as a butter-box
and practically a primate.
Nevertheless, from time to
time, I for catharsis of some
sort, he to employ doll-less
desolation, we went on the
scoot together. What he got
from these outings except
hangovers and grog-blossoms
I do not know ; I learned the
last verse of Die Lorelei.

THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Educational Inadequacy
A high-school principal in
N.S.W. has delivered a broad-
side against what he calls “out-
side coaching” and the estab-
lishments which cater for this
real or supposed need.
The headmaster is reported
to have alluded to “quacks
without sound credentials or
professional integrity who
profess to cure educational
inadequacy,” and to have
urged the State Government to
license professional out-of-
school coaches.
The headmaster himself is
presumably a person with
some sort of university-degree,
trained in one of those Govern-
ment-sponsored schools for
teachers which, though not
true collegiate foundations, are
called “colleges.” He is also,
of course, an unlicensed
teacher, for there are no
licensed teachers in N.S.W.,
Queensland or South Australia.
State registration of teachers!
of any sort is known only in
Victoria and Tasmania.
Of course, many features of
coaching - college advertising
are displeasing and some
possibly semi-fraudulent, and
this headmaster was right to
draw parents’ attention to the
fact that a silk purse cannot be
made out of a sow’s ear. But
when, as reported, he says that
“few boys need outside coach-
ing, and fewer still respond to
it,” he is on very shaky
ground.
My own experience as an
out-of-school coach has con-
vinced me that there is a need
for coaching ; that the current
educational - system is not
sound ; and that many second-
ary-school teachers in private
and public schools are either
ineffective or incompetent.
I have been in close contact
during the past four or five
years with many secondary-
school boys and girls who were
obviously far below the com-
munication-level (though not
necessarily the intelligence-
level) of the teacher. I have
known boys at sub-senior
level who, in a group of 30
or so, were taken as part of
the senior class, in the senior
classroom, under one master
who was obviously unable to
cope with the necessary amount
of correction-work, let alone
the question of discipline. Boys
I have tried to instruct at
senior standard in essay-
writing, though native-born
Australians, wrote English like
foreigners. They assured me
that they never wrote an essay
as part of their school-work
because the teacher had no time
to correct it.
What goes on in the class-
rooms of Australian schools
ordinary parents have no
means of knowing •; they can
judge only by results. Results
at both tertiary- and secondary-
levels are far from satisfac-
tory, and if the Government
will not realise that the public-
examination system, as well as
the system which is supposed
to be able to determine when
and how a man may be con-
sidered a competent teacher, is
in need of overhaul, then out-
of-school coaching is the only
logical result.— Sir (Q.).
Housing Needs
As “Wusslean” claims (B.
16/12/’59), it might not be
axiomatic that the current rate
of building will be followed by
a collapse of the industry, but
the betting is 10 to 1 on if
something isn’t done to pre-
vent collapse.
The figures given by Mr.
Cramer in Parliament dealt
with every aspect of the
problem, allowing for naturals
increase and immigration. The
position could arise that in
two years’ time we’d have a
work-force capable of building
100,000 houses and flats a
year, and the demand could
fall to 75,000 houses and flats
a year. This fall would be
severe enough to cause wide-
spread unemployment in the
industry.
As regards immigration it
should be remembered that this
includes about 16,000 building-
tradesmen a year. What would
happen to them?
It is also likely that the so-
called backlog of housing-
demand is exaggerated. It’s
only natural for people need-
ing a house to register with ail
the different institutions for a
building-loan, thereby inflating
the lists.
It’s not a question of dump-
ing the building-trades or
having a housing-shortage, as
“Wusslean” claims, but of
facing facts and tapering-off
the building-programme so
that the work-force is more in
keeping with future needs. The
Government seems to be fully
aware of this position. It
should not be influenced by
ill - advised critics. Chips

Accidents and Alcohol
Experts concerned with
reducing the accident-toll on
roads differ as to what
remedial steps should be taken
(B. 16/12 / ’59).
A year or so ago the Vic-
torian Government professed
to be gravely concerned over
the road-toll, especially the
“If you take the TV, take him with it!”
problem of the drinking driver.
A special police accident-
appreciation squad was estab-
lished to study accidents and
their causes on the spot.
Government spokesmen,
from the Premier down, tried
to tell people about the
dangers of mixing drinking
and driving. For several
months police-surgeon Birrell
was allowed to have his say
without hindrance.
1 was impressed by Dr.
Birrell’s sincerity. Whatever
one might think about the
main remedy he suggested—
the compulsory blood-test —
he certainly spoke knowledge-
ably on the matter.
From October last Dr.
Birrell has not been permitted
to speak freely in public on
the subject of road-accident
prevention. His official silence
dates from a time when liquor-
interests publicly protested
against his utterances, on the
ground that, as a public ser-
vant, he was infringing upon
Government policy matters;
and the Victorian Govern-
ment has preferred to wait
upon the publication of reports
by its pathologist on what is
being attempted in overseas
countries.
It remains to be seen what
the State Government will do.
This Christmas, _ Victorians
have heard urgent radio-
appeals for blood-donors “to
build-up stocks for the Christ-
mas-New Year period.” Noth-
ing short of slaughter on
the roads, it seems, will spur
the Government into action. —
Wusslean (Vic.).
What Priestley Missed
Comments by visiting Eng-
lish author J. B. Priestley in-
cluded a lament to the effect
that, in this “harsh, strangely
empty land,” he missed the
wealth of flowers and birds that
Britain had.
Maybe Sydney Heads were a
trifle harsher (more rugged,
anyway) than the cliffs of
Dover, or even the gaunt rocks
of Ilkley Moor; but as for
the flora-fauna comparison—
how could Australia be ex-
pected to score marks from a
visitor not primarily concerned
with natural-history? J.B.’s
first wife, a naturalist and
compiler of an engaging
anthology, A Book of Birds
(1937), would certainly have
ensured that any comments
made on the local fauna and
flora were based on experience.
It’s true enough that flowers
and birds are “laid-on” less
profusely in Australia than in
Britain, or at least England.

“It says: ‘Here come the Martians'"
Being distributed here over a
vastly greater and more varied
country, they are in general
more patchy. In any given
area in England you will
usually see a larger number of
birds than in any relative area
of Australia, and from those
birds will come a greater, or at
least more consistent, volume
of song than we customarily
hear in this country.
On the other hand, Australia
has a much larger number of
bird-species than Britain, and
also many more kinds that are
very distinctive, ranging from
the hefty emu and cassowary,
past the lyrebird and the mallee-
fowl, to the tiny and beautiful
fairy-wrens.
As for vocalism, Australia's
birds in general are more
notable as soloists than as
choristers, and as unorthodox
performers rather than
“normal” singers, but among
them are some melodists no
less gifted than the skylark,
or even the nightingale.
Only recently, for example,
I chanced to hear an English
blackbird singing in the bush at
the same time as a crested bell-
bird, and, as a striking fact,
that competent performer from
abroad was made to sound
second-rate by the highly
melodious native bird.
All things considered, it was
a pity Priestley didn’t get some
useful guidance in the matter
of birds and flowers when he
descended upon this “harsh,
strangely empty land.” —Phil
Anthus (N.S.W.).
Anzac Observance
Victorian R.S.L. members
have had their poll on the
question of Anzac Day obser-
vance —21,933 in favor of a
change, 8576 against.
This doesn’t merely mean
that only 22,000 out of the
69,000 Victorian members
want a change ; many members
have become so tired of the
30 years’ squabble and opposi-
tion to a plebiscite that they
were not interested enough to
vote. They have been con-
ducting their own reunions in
their own way.
I was present at the 1931
conference .when the late
George Worboys, representing
Melbourne, said that he and
his two colleagues, standing for
1400 members, might as well
stay away when they were out-
voted by four small sub-
branches with 140 members
between them. I was also
present in 1937 when Bill
Coulson, representing Caulfield,
with over 1400 members, made
a similar complaint.
The public, including mem-
bers of the Victorian branch
and those returned men not
members, have been trying to
end the controversy by a
referendum for about 30 years.
George Holland flogged the
“Sacred Anzac Day” horse for
20 years; Charlie Joyce has
kept it in harness for another
eight years or more ; the time
has come to unharness it. —

Failure of a Country
Industry
The Braidwood (N.S.W.)
eucalyptus industry, which was
in a thriving condition about
five years ago at the time an
excellent article on the
industry by Graham Phillips
appeared in The Bulletin, is
now in a much more parlous
state.
According to a report pre-
sented at the Southern Table-
lands Regional Development
Committee a few weeks ago the
industry has been almost
wiped out.
Three developments have
caused this. The first was the
return to the market of pine-
oil, produced by the wood-
resin industry and marketed at
a price much below that at
which peppermint-oil can be
produced.
The second and most im-
portant development has been
the production of an oil as a
by-product of the camphor
industry in cheap - labor
countries. This oil used to be
wasted, but increased technical
efficiency has produced a
satisfactory result.
Also, a synthetic menthol
is now being made in the
U.S.A. from oil-of-turpentine ;
and South African plantations,
which have recently come into
production, have captured the
big French market which was
once held firmly by the Aus-
tralian product. Ironically,
of course, it was the export of
Australian gums to S’Africa
which gave the Springboks
their start in the industry.
What is to be done? Import-
control, perhaps, or the rais-
ing of the technical efficiency
of the Braidwood industry. But
it is certainly not a good thing
either for Braidwood or Aus-
tralia as a whole. — Zorok

Group Teaching
Lately in a city school I saw
a demonstration of group-
method teaching. Basically
the method consists in allow-
ing children to divide them-
selves into groups of about
seven or eight for the purpose
of working out planned assign-
ments in a variety of subjects.
I saw groups in different
grades in a primary school
working at arithmetic, social-
studies, oral expression, read-
ing and science. What im-
pressed me and other visitors
was the way the children
worked despite the peering of
some 20 onlookers who also
deprived them of the teacher’s
occasional help by completely
monopolising him.
I was told that when
children select their own
workmates provided the
assignments are presented in
an interesting manner —each
group develops its own working
momentum. It is then that one
of the greatest advantages of
the system is apparent, for


members of the group who do
not work Or who interfere with
the work are made to feel
‘ v outsiders” by the others.
Such a way of getting
children to work seems too
good to be true. Perhaps that’s
why other teachers are so slow
to try it out. But it seems the
.answer to many a teacher’s
most harassing problem—how
to keep 40 or more children
all working at a worth-while
project.
I was assured that the groups
accomplish just as much, if not
more, in this way than by the
old classroom teaching-
methods, and that at times it
is difficult to cope with the
speed with which children get
through the marking and
recording of results of indi-
viduals and of the group,
particularly in mathematics. At
the same time group-members
are adding to their social de-
velopment and emotional
stability.
One of the highlights of the
visit was to listen to a class of
11-year-olds divided into seven
groups of six discussing the
problem of how much pocket-
money should be given to 11-
year-olds. They discussed the
problem simultaneously. Pande-
monium? No. True, there was
a fairly obvious buzz of con-
versation (perhaps that’s why
they are called buzz-groups),
but it was not loud enough to
interfere with the discussion
of any group. Then, at an
appropriate moment, each
group reported its findings
through one of its members.
The findings were further dis-
cussed, queried and elaborated
until a final summing-up was
given.
Altogether an excellent
example in citizenship—a
problem examined in a manner
that would have done credit
to many an adult body. Here
it was evident that children
were learning what manv
adults have failed to do —to
listen to points of view other
than their own, and to present
their own for critical appraisal.
And yet the difficulty is to
persuade teachers to adopt
this procedure. Western

campaign, via the B.M.A.
journal, for the redesigning of
some types of motor-mowers
to make them safer to use.
Their criticism is directed at
newer types of petrol-driven
machines which, according to
the medicos, have been respon-
sible for quite a number of
accidents over the last few
years.
There is no doubt that a
mower operating on a footpath
where loose stones are scat-
tered around will shoot these
stones out with gusto. I should
say that in such cases the
person using the mower, rather
than the machine itself, is to
blame. After all, it’s a simple
matter to inspect a lawn or a
footpath and remove all loose
stones before switching on the
machine. Similarly, people
unable to keep their feet away
from the mower-blades have
only themselves to blame if an
accident occurs.
I wish, though, that medical
men would organise a protest
at the terrific din some mowers
make. Anyone living in an
area where one of these shriek-
ing machines starts-up has little
chance of soothing rest: or
recreation ; and a mower duet
is plain horrible. M. F. D.

Elections and Mayors
Ratepayers in many areas
have mixed feelings over the
results of the latest local-
government elections. Some
think the election of a mayor
by popular vote for a three-
year term is a good thing:
others feel that it tends to give
the office-holder a sense of
power.
One of the first things Syd-
ney’s Lord Mayor Jensen did
after being returned to office
was to urge the Sydney County
Council to donate £50,000 to
the Sydney Opera House
appeal. It seems at least
questionable to use money
which belongs to consumers of
electricity in the council’s area
to support such a cause. The
money might better be diverted
to reduce, say, the price of
electricity.
In other areas, where the
mayor was elected by popular
vote, the defeat of one or more
candidates meant councils lost
the services of men who would
have been returned as aider-
men had they elected to stand

The Good Earth
I’m all the way with
“R.H.G.” (B. 16/12/’59) when
he says that good soil can be
created on apparently “barren”
earth.
Given water and organic
matter you can grow anything
anywhere. Organic matter is
essential. With household
garbage, rotting grass and
cow-manure, I’ve developed
good flower- and vegetable-
gardens from a base of coke-
ashes used as filling. Others
have done the same with soil
that, untreated, wouldn’t grow
thistles or Parramatta-grass.
By burning, burying and
dumping our garbage at sea
we are wasting every day thou-
sands of tons of valuable
organic matter, which could
build and increase the fertility
of any soil where water was
available. And seaweed is
another rich source of organic
plant-food.
Soil-building demands a new
approach to agriculture and
horticulture. It is an approach
that the more enlightened
users of the soil are following.

Bank Salaries
I have before me two papers
—one a daily, the other a small
magazine issued by the Aus-
tralian Bank Officials’ Associ-
ation. The first contains a
large display advertisment
from a trading-bank in search
of male and female staff. It
lists the attractive scale of
salaries (with an extra reward
for merit), generous leave, ex-
cellent amenities, liberal sick-
leave, social- and sporting-
clubs, financial assistance as
subjects are passed in such
courses as accountancy, bank-
ing and economics, and cash
bonuses upon completion of
courses. In addition, the bank
pays generous medical-benefits
to any officer on behalf of
himself and his family—up to
£250 in any one financial year.
The scheme is non-contri-
butory. There are also retiring-
allowance and “outstanding
pension benefits.”
It all sounds most attractive,
especially to one who worked
under the old conditions.
Nevertheless, the bank-officials’
magazine is full of complaints,
stressing that members should
be entitled to enjoy the
“decent” things of life “with-
out recourse to payment
through hire-purchase, double
jobs, joint husband-wife in-
come and the other things that
are smashing family life and
with it the Christian purposes
for which we exist.”
What is one to believe? My
own view is that the Bank
Officials’ Association is asking
a great deal, and I’m more in-
clined to believe that the con-
ditions of employment as set
out in the bank’s advertisement
are nearer the truth. There is
such a thing as being too
hungry, and there is also the
chance that the goose which
lays the golden eggs may be
destroyed. If the costs of
'operating a bank rise much
higher the banks may put
their heads together and de-
cide on a rationalisation pro-
gramme with reciprocal closing
of branches, and then where
would the bank-officials be?
Taking it by and large, there
aren’t many towns where one
or more branches could not be
closed, and the opinion is
pretty generally held that Aus-
tralia is, if anything, over-
banked. In the cities, banks
seem to sprout on every corner.
The officials’ magazine is not
without its humorous side. For
example, a young bank-officer
(seven years’ service) in a
letter to the editor complains
that as his friends include such
people as h.-p. representatives,
insurance- and stock-and-
station agents, he finds he
cannot “compete” with them,
as he usually does not have the
cash to put a few bottles of
beer in the fridge for the
occasions when his friends call.
Assuming he is aged about 23,
it would be interesting to know
in what sort of competition he
is engaged. I think he is darned
lucky to have a fridge at all.
Another humorous feature
deals with the refusal of staff-
inspectors of the various banks
to meet the wives of disgruntled
bank-officials for the purpose
of discussing salary-levels and
the problems associated with
living on them. I think he
would be a brave staff-
inspector who would venture to
put his head into that lionesses’
mouth.
Time marches on, and to one
who remembers the days when
a man valued his job and
simply did his best in it, the
present set-up seems very
strange indeed.—Ceg (Vic.).

KEEPING SOILS FERTILE
From “MANDIBAR”
A/Tore and more people in the
world needing more and
more food and clothing means
that it’s more important than
ever to keep the soil fertile
in spite of the increasing
demands made on it.
This can only be done by
replacing plant-foods removed
by cropping and grazing. Some-
times this treatment produces
soils even richer than in their
virgin state.
Soil needs periodic rests to
recuperate after cultivation.
The days are gone when a
cropper could move to new
ground after exploiting the old,
as in some of the tobacco-
growing areas of America’s
Deep South. And the world
can no longer Jtfford to
abandon once-rich areas, like

essential minerals. The first
optimistic flush of production
may easily fade under exploita-
tion, and measures to save
original investment can be
costly.
In the past, loss of fertility
was not always recognised until
its more obvious symptoms had
shown themselves. These
symptoms include excessive
blowing or gullying; tighten-
ing of soil as its structure
deteriorates; crop sickness;
declining yields; and easily
recognisable signs of malnu-
trition, such as yellowing of
the foliage.
Because of the cost and time
needed to repair damage
which has gone as far as this,
it’s an advantage to be able
to detect the first signs of loss
of fertility and to correct the
trouble early, more effectively
and at lower cost.
Soil often loses fertility be-
fore its owner recognises the
trouble, though science has
now produced ways of attract-
ing our attention before it is
too late. For instance, the
greying of black fleeces is such
a strong indication of copper-
shortage that some American
flockmasters keep a few black
sheep specially to show
whether there is a safe
amount of this valuable
mineral on their properties.
An even better sign is the
straightening or “steeliness” in
normal crimped white fleeces,
but this is usually not seen
until shearing-time.
Certain weeds, 100, can
indicate reduced fertility. For
example, it's no coincidence
that wild-mustard, wild-turnip
and skeleton-weed have spread
into Victorian and other wheat-
growing areas only after many
years of cropping.
It has been shown in the
U.S.A. that some weeds
cannot live in rich soils, and
that, even in a paddock which
does not grow them normally,
they can colonise a plot which
has been cropped too heavily.
Thus, their appearance may be
a sign that an apparently
normal soil is on the down-
grade. One striking example is
flat-weed, which invades
pastures becoming short of
potash, a mineral costly to
replace if its scarcity is not
detected soon enough.
Chemical and organic treat-
ment to restore the soil’s
fertility can be more effective
than weedicides. Where organic
matter, rather than a mineral,
is lacking, a clover-pasture can
bring land back to normal, and
even improve it.
A less obvious way in
which soil-losses can be
detected early is by insects
which, although unable to
attack plants growing on
healthy soil, cause consider-
able damage to the same crops
where the soil lacks certain
minerals.
It has been shown that
maize-cobs grown on healthy
soil resist grain - borers,
whereas under identical
storage-conditions cobs from
poor soil are eaten by the
insect. Other experiments have
shown that spinach resists
thrips only when grown in soil
with the right proportions of
calcium and nitrogen, and
that soy-beans resist fungi
when they get enough calcium.
These findings have led to
the belief that plants probably
manufacture their own anti-
biotics when grown on healthy
soils. Hence, use of modern
insecticides and fungicides
might only be relieving the
immediate problem without
removing its underlying cause.
A sign of declining fertility,
evident to a chemist but often
unseen by a farmer, is the
lowered baking-quality of
grain from crops whose yields
are apparently unaffected by
the first stages of deterioration.
At Longerenong Agricul-
tural College, near Horsham
(Vic.), the nitrogen-content of
soil alternatively under fallow,
wheat and pasture dropped
from 110 parts in 100,000 in
1916 to 74 parts in 1957. Land
under even greater stress —
wheat every second year—
went down in nitrogen from
110 parts in 100,000 to 66
during the same period.
During the past 10 years soil
under fallow, wheat and
pasture has given 9.1 per cent,
of grain-protein and an average
yield of 44} bushels to the
acre, compared with 8.4 per
cent, grain-protein and 33
bushels an acre from soil
more frequently cropped.
If these measurements had
not been taken an ordinary
farmer might not have noticed
much deterioration of his soil
and would probably-have gone
on cropping it in the same old
way. He may even have
blamed the seasons or perhaps
new varieties (“Not as good
as we had in the old days”)
until either the soil broke-
down completely or he found
wheat uneconomic to grow.
As a matter of fact, improved
varieties and practices have
masked losses of fertility in
many areas.
Fortunately this decline,
which is mainly loss of nitro-
gen, can be arrested by grow-
ing such pastures as clovers
and medics, which build-up
fertility. For instance, after
only two years under this pas-
ture the protein-content of
wheat improved by 10 per cent.

loaf-quality and the health of
those who eat it.
In addition, higher yields
usually come from greater
amounts of nitrogen in the soil,
so a farmer gains both ways
if he knows how to recognise
the first signs of soil-deteriora-
tion, and knows the methods
of correcting it.
This symptom of declining
soil-fertility during a period
of cultivation is, of course, not
confined to Victoria, or to
Australia. In 1940 the protein-
content of Kansas (U.S.A.)
wheat ranged from 10 per
cent, in the east to 18 per cent,
in the richer counties of the
west. However, after 10 years
of cropping, no county pro-
duced more than 15 per cent,
protein. The problem could
therefore be almost world-
wide, except perhaps in the
older countries where intensive
soil-management has been
gradually developed over a
long period.
The possible effect of this
hidden decline on animal and
human health is even more
alarming than the reduction in
quality and yield of crops and
their lowered resistance to pests
and diseases. Evidence is
accumulating that, among other
things, the fertility of animals
is affected by the soil on which
their foods are grown.
Male rabbits fed on hay
from soil which had been
fertilised only with phosphates
declined in their viability and
desire to mate. However,
within three weeks of having
their diet changed to hay from
soil fertilised with lime as well
as phosphates they lost their
indifference and became active.
Conversely, vigorous rabbits
which had been eating hay
from soil that had received
both lime and phosphates lost
their vigor within three weeks
of changing to hay from soil
fertilised only with phosphates.
It has also been shown that
weight of rabbits and breaking-
strength of their femur-bones
increases as they obtain their
feed on soils of greater chemi-
cal fertility. Many more
rabbits died during a 1954
heatwave when eating hay
from deficient soils than did
those which had hay from
healthy soils.
Evidence accumulates to
show that the health and habits
of animals in general are
greatly dependent on the soils
which grow their food.
Native-deer survive better and
have a higher percentage of
twin fawns when grazing on
certain fertile soils; carniver-
ous animals dominate the
older highly-leached tropical
forest - soils; herbiverous
animals, like the bison, selected
the best grazing on the rich
prairies ; wool is harder to card
when produced on poor soils ;
and, of course, the calcareous
Kentucky bluegrass-country is
world-famous for its race-
horses.
As head of the animal-
world, man, too, is more
dependent on soil-fertility
than he may think. A striking
example of this came from
America when the extent of
dental decay found in men
examined for the U.S. forces
during War II was closely
related to the soils on which
these men’s food was produced.
The significance of soil-
fertility may indeed be far
greater than we think —even
affecting the possibility of our
survival. For this reason, as
well as to ensure food and
clothing for future generations,
we should take more notice
than ever of those danger-
signals by which Nature warns
us when soil begins to
deteriorate.
Thermoduric Bacteria
“Freddie”: Thermoduric
bacteria in milk are a head-
ache for supplier and factory
alike.
The factory’s milk is checked
by bacteriologists, and if the
results are unfavorable the
farmer gets a curt note to do
his bit.
The factory people can
generally control the trouble,
provided they receive clean
milk on their platform, but if
the thermoduric bacteria are in
the milk when it’s graded on
the floor the most they can
expect to do is not add to the
numbers already there.
Research has shown that one
of the main causes of high
thermo-counts is cracked
rubbers on the machines,
making thorough cleaning
difficult, even when actually
boiling water is used for flush-
ing. Many bacteria escape by
hiding in deep cracks in the
rubber.
The second main cause has
been found to be insufficient
boiling water at wash-up time — :
even if boiling at the start, water
cools in a matter of minutes.
What is absolutely essential is
a flush with boiling water as a
final rinse after cleaning, and
this must be made with water
that is actually bubbling when
it is taken from the hot-water
system. As the name implies,
thermoduric bacteria are able
to live through high tempera-
tures.
Thus, by replacing cracked
and worn rubbers and using
actually boiling water as a
final rinse thermodurics can
be beaten. Removal of milk-
and water-stone deposits in
machine-pipelines should not
be neglected. Even if they do
not breed thermo-bacteria, they
do the pipes no good.
Thermoduric bacteria are
not really harmful, but when
the housewife buys a bottle
of milk she doesn’t expect part
of the bottle to be occupied
by bacteria. That’s why they’re
trying to beat thermoduric.
Commercial
Corriedales
“Pat O'Day”: Bred by a
studmaster on the Riverina, a
new type of Corriedale is
attracting general interest. The
type does well in semi-improved
country.
This commercial Corriedale
differs from the breed-standard
both in conformation and
quality of wool. It’s a big,
upstanding sheep, with more
on the leg but lighter in the
shoulder, and has a fuller front,
better covered back and more
open face than the ordinary
Corriedale.
Its wool-selection is closer
to that of the Merino. Out-
standing clips have fetched
good prices this season, and
the average cut is 111 b. to 131 b.
from breeders and ewe-
hoggets.
Lambing - percentages are
good, too. Joining is arranged
to give an autumn lamb, and
figures of 85 per cent, up to
90 per cent, are generally
reached, using about three
rams to 100 ewes, with regular
joining, and allowing rams to
paddock-mate with ewes for
some weeks afterwards.
Table Poultry
“North”: Agricultural
Department officers at the
Rocklea Animal Husbandry
Research Farm, near Brisbane,
have been trying to develop a
strain of table-fowl which can
be produced at a price to com-
pete with beef, pork or lamb.
At present a cross of Indian
Game with White Leghorn
shows most promise, combining
meaty characteristics with
rapid growth. The poorly de-
veloped • V-shaped breast,
common in present-day birds,
will be replaced by a full,
round breast, which will add
to the fowl’s weight.
A properly balanced diet,
with ample greenfeed and a
little aureomycin antibiotic
added, helps poultry farmers to
turn-off their birds much faster
and cheaper. One part of
aureomycin - supplement in
18,000 parts of total feed means
that birds put on weight more
quickly, but eat less food.
The raising of table-birds,
or broilers as they are called,
has become a major industry in
the south-eastern corner of
Queensland 67,000 were
handled by the abattoirs at
Brisbane and on the Gold
Coast during August. Farmers
are extending their plants to
cope with this development—
one man is expecting to raise
220,000 during the coming
year!
With big-scale production,
and more efficient strains of
birds, as well as an improved
feeding-technique, poultry
could become an everyday item
on household menus.
Of Prickly-pear
“Kesem”: In 1912 the
Queensland Government,
worried over the spread of
prickly-pear, offered 100,000
acres near Dulacca, where the
infestation was worst, as a
prize to anyone able to get
rid of the pest. An American
chemist, aptly named Oliver
Cromwell Roberts, took up the
challenge.
He established his laboratory
at Dulacca. On the sheep-
station there 50 years before
prickly-pear had been carefully


planted and so lovingly tended
(that a horse-boy was once
sacked because he forgot to
water the precious growth.

half-a-mile apart, and fires
were lit under the boilers, into
which the prepared poison had
been emptied. The deadly gas
generated by this heat was
into the pear and,
being heavier than air, settled
on the growth. For a time the
experiment proved successful,
and all visible pear died from
the effects of the gas. Con-
gratulations were showered on
Roberts, who was entertained
at a dinner, complete with
Government representatives
from Brisbane and compli-
mentary speeches galore.
But a wettish spring fol-
lowed, and under the layers of
poisoned pear a new, vigorous
growth began to push its way.
The faces of disheartened
settlers —many of whom had
come from the south a few
years previously, following the
lure of cheap land grew
longer and longer.
In 1915 Cactus Estates went
into liquidation. “Oliver
Cromwell” took his plant to
Tenterfield (N.S.W.) to make
further chemical experiments
in his battle against the pest.
He was later killed in a road-
smash.
Segregating Wheats
“Pieter Nuyts”: To assist
both local trade and exports
some Victorian flourmillers
have asked Wimmera wheat-
growers to segregate their
wheats into two grades—soft
and harder. The problem is
equally present here in
Westralia.
Segregation will have to
come, because as long as Aus-
tralia is a wheatgrowing coun-
try we’ll be producing both
strong and weak wheats. Some
people oppose the idea on the
ground that it will prevent them
raising the standard of all
Australian wheat to “strong.”
That isn’t possible, however,
because much of the acreage
sown to wheat in Australia
can’t produce strong wheat
whatever varieties are sown on
it; and it’s not a practical
proposition to restrict wheat-
growing to land which will
produce only strong wheats.
Apart from that, flour which
makes the best bread doesn’t
necessarily please the biscuit-
manufacturer, and biscuit-
making is becoming a big and
important industry in Aus-
tralia.
For years millers in the
different States have been pay-
ing premium rates for a cer-
tain amount of strong wheat,
and it wouldn’t call for much
organisation to increase the
rate. In W.A. bulk-handling
needn’t be a major obstacle,
because sidings without dual
facilities could be restricted to
one grade, without causing
much extra travelling for any
farmer.
Segregation would help us
in the export-markets for both
wheat and flour; and, with
competition keener and some
of our customer - countries
starting to grow their own
wheat and establish their own
mills, we can’t afford to miss
a trick. To hold those markets
we’ve got to produce the sort
of goods our customers want.
The same principle applies
to the domestic market. It’s
sometimes taken for granted
that the Australian wheat-
grower needn’t fear competi-
tion as far as the Australian
consumer is concerned. That
belief is dangerous. Consump-
tion of wheat-products in
Australia falls a long way
short of what it could be,
and even with increased popu-
lation it won’t increase pro-
portionately if we keep our
flourmillers, bakers and pastry-
cooks shackled to outmoded
conceptions and practices. As
our overseas markets contract,
Australian wheatgrowers will
have to look more and more
to the Australian public to
absorb their produce —and
there isn’t unlimited time to
cultivate that market.
Cattle-tick
“North”: Cattle-ticks are
costing owners in Queensland
an estimated £9 rhillion or
more annually. This includes
labor in mustering, dipping,
and repairs to yards and dips,
million ; loss in weight of
beef - cattle and resultant
greater age when tumed-off,
£2 million; reduced produc-
tion of milking-cows, £ll
million. An estimated 35,000
head die from tick-infection,
redwater, etc., and about
28,000 are lost as the result of
a combination of drought and
ticks. These cattle are worth
at least £2 million.
Tick-outbreaks in southern
areas of the State have reached
serious proportions. Over 100
properties have been quaran-
tined around Toowoomba and
a similar number near Kinga-
roy, in the South Burnett.
Agricultural Department
officers have started dipping
or spraying of cattle the
infested areas, with continued
treatment fortnightly.
Feeding-out Silage
“Rodger”: Many Queens-
land farmers are taking the
hard work out of feeding
silage by letting the cows do
it themselves.
Two types of silos are being
used for these self-service
centres: the clamp and the
cylindrical—both are above-
ground silos, of course.
Feeding-out saves the cost
of stalls, and the waste is no
greater than when silage is
tossed out in the paddock, as
on most farms. It saves labor,
too (there’s no harder job than
chopping and lumping heavy
silage around).
To make a clamp-silo hold-
ing up to 140 tons you need
two wooden sides, each 90ft.
Jong; they can be of any
secondary timber. The planks
are nailed to sft. uprights.
The width of the silo averages
from 22ft. to 24ft., with, the
greater width at the top.
Sloping sides allow the green
material to be packed down
tighter than if they were
perpendicular. Each sft. up-
right is strutted like a strainer-
post to keep the sides from
spreading.
When silage is ready to feed-
out the ends are exposed, and
frames —roughly 4ft. high, with
a space between each frame
of 2ft. 6in. —are fitted to each
end. This allows a cow to
feed without difficulty, but is
narrow enough to keep the
animal from pushing through.
When the frame is built it
looks like a home-made ladder,
and it can be moved as the
silage is eaten. Dehorned
cattle feed much better than
horned when this method of
feeding-out is practised.
In cylindrical silos, which
are built of weldmesh, the
green material stamps-down
better if cut with a forage-
harvester. One drawback to
this method, though, is that all
silage has to be packed-down
by manpower, whereas with
the clamp, a tractor can be

driven backwards and forwards
over the mass to consolidate-it.
To feed-out the greenstuff
from a cylindrical silo a strip
of the weldmesh is removed,
enabling cattle to eat into the
mass. As the bottom layer is
eaten the silage slides down
and is always at cow-level.
An average of about eight
cows at a time can be fed from
a silo of this type. Roughly
20 can be fed from the clamp.
The advantage of the upright
cylindrical silo is that it can
be built in any convenient
corner of the paddock or yard.
It is as well to have the floor
of the cylindrical silo raised
slightly above the ground to
give plenty of drainage, though
there’s no need to concrete it.
Length of Lactation
“Ruddigore”: In 1950 the
yearly average milking-period
for all cows tested in Queens-
land was 203 days, which
meant that these grade-cows
were dry five months out of
12 —and there’s no profit in a
dry cow which has to be fed
but gives nothing in return.
Research has shown that two
months is plenty for a cow
to spell between calvings, and
this can be reduced to six weeks
if the season has been good
and cattle are in top condition.
Herd-testing results show,
however, that length of lacta-
tion in the State’s grade-cows
has improved since the 1950
figures were published. The
average lactation hovered
around the 209-day period for
several years, then rose to 230
days in 1956 and 247 days in
1958.
If cows average a half-
gallon each during these extra
43 days they are milking and
a herd has 50 milkers, there’s
an extra 1075 gal. —a lot of
milk in any lingo.
An easy way to explain this
increase is to give all the
credit to herd-testing; but,
while herd-testing is at the
bottom of it, it’s really inter-
pretation of results that has
made the difference.
One important factor is the
type of season. No matter how
much you test, cows won’t milk
in a drought when there’s no
food about. Still, taken on a
State-wide basis, 1957 and
1958 were anything but good
years, so good seasons are not
solely responsible for the im-
provement.
Controlled mating, which
allows cows to calve at a time
best suited to the particular
district, has helped to make
some herds milk longer, but
such mating is practised on
only a small number of Queens-
land farms which run grade-
herds, so that’s not the whole
answer, either.
Culling on performance, as
shown by test-results, has been
important in drawing-out the
lactation-period. Before testing
became widespread all culling
was done on guesswork: now
it's done on performance,
length of lactation and free-
dom from disease.
Greater attention to breed-
ing-problems has been one of
the reasons cows now milk
longer. Herd-testing shows-up
the shy breeders, those that
abort and those that fail to
come on heat. Previously, with
no detailed check on the herd,
most farmers depended on
their calf-drop to tell whether
the cows were breeding regu-
larly. This never showed where
to start on the trouble.
Herd-testing results point out
which cows breed regularly,
and milk well and longest, and
farmers are now using these to
breed their replacements. This
is helping to lengthen the milk-
ing-period for the whole herd.

boats on the Murray (B. 2/12/’59)?
This question has been answered in
a paper read before the History
Division of the Royal Geographical
Society, S.A. Branch, this year.
Here’s some information in brief (a
full report is due to be published
in the society’s proceedings): The
Adelaide (oldest boat) is hauling
timber; the Coonawarra r-ebuilt
from a barge; the Wansa rebuilt
from a barge; the Gem at Mildura;
the Kookaburra occasionally on

(From “Marcus”): St. Gotthard s
Pass (B. 16/12/’59) carries one of
the most celebrated alpine passes
from Switzerland to Italy. Because
the way lies through two very
narrow alpine valleys much exposed
to avalanches, it was formerly
almost inaccessible —hence impreg-
nable. Beneath the pass today is
the St. Gotthard Tunnel (9* miles
long, at a height of 3786 ft.) through
which runs the railway from Lucerne
to Milan. There are no “fortifica-
tions” there other than fortifications
against the natural hazards of such
an area.

What are a woman’s grounds for
divorce in N.S.W. ?
N.S.W. law at present allows a
woman a divorce if she has been
deserted for three years; if her
husband has committed adultery,
or is habitually drunk and fails to
support her; if he is habitually
drunk and beats her or repeatedly
beats her or fails to comply with
an order of the court ordering him
to return to her. In addition, she
may use the ground of desertion
for three years and upwards if,
though she is the person leaving
the home, she has been forced to
do so by the conduct of the hus-
band. She may also get a divorce
if her husband has been convicted
of a number of crimes. There is
no specific ground of mental cruelty.
If a husband’s conduct towards his
wife is such as to make her leave
him because she fears the result of
bis conduct on her mental health,
she may subsequently claim that
he has deserted her. The latest
divorce bill is not yet law and may
not become law for some time.
It is very doubtful whether a copy
of the bill would be of any use
to you.

What happened when the P. and
O. armed merchant-cruiser Rawal-
pindi encountered a German battle-
ship in the North Atlantic ?
(From W. R. Medway Smith):
Early in November, 1939, two
German battleships, Scharnhorst
and Gneisenau, made a sortie into
the North Atlantic Ocean. After
eluding any major British ships,
Scharnhorst intercepted the armed
merchant-cruiser H.M.S. Rawal-
pindi on November 23: Rawalpindi
was on patrol south of Iceland.
Scharnhorst was a new battleship
of 26,000 tons, carrying nine llin.
“Now’s your chance —you reckoned you could beat him
with your eyes shut!"
guns as her main armament. She
was capable of 27 knots. H.M.S.
Rawalpindi was a 14-year-old
P. and O. liner of 16,697 tons, fitted
with 6jn. guns and capable of
17 knots.
Captain Kennedy of the Rawal-
pindi thought the enemy vessel was
the pocket-battleship Deutschland,
and signalled accordingly; but there
was no time for help to arrive.
Knowing the hopelessness of such
an unequal contest (he had, in
fact, tw'o battleships against him),
Kennedy bravely fought his ship
for 40min. until all his guns were
put out of action. With colors still
flying, the Rawalpindi went down
with all remaining hands after about
40 of her crew had got away in
a few battered boats. The infor-
mation from this action disclosed
details of these two enemy ships,
and the hunt became too hot for
them. They immediately abandoned
their cruise, successfully eluded the
British pursuers and returned to
Germany.
Although always a menace, the
Scharnhorst (like the other battle-
ship) subsequently never did any
of the wonderful things Hitler
expected of her. She was sunk by
the British off North Cape on
Dec. 23, 1943.

Information on Sydney’s Garden
Palace ? When was it burnt down ?
It w'as a large building erected
to house the Sydney International
Exhibition (1879-80), and was
located on the eastern slope of what
w'as then known as the “outer
domain” of Government House,
slightly to the south of the Govern-
ment stables (now the Conserva-
toriurn of Music). The building
had a central dome of fine pro-
portions, supported by four huge
tow'ers. Centrally under the dome
a fountain was erected, surmounted
by a statue of Queen Victoria;
this was the focal point of the
exhibition-floor. The exhibition was
opened on September 17, 1879, and
closed on April 20, 1880; the
building subsequently stayed in use
for some years, mainly as an
auditorium for concerts and other
entertainments. It was destroyed by
fire on September 22, 1882 —one of
the most spectacular sights of the
kind ever seen in Sydney. The fire
incinerated 300 pictures belonging
to the Art Society, as well as the
scientific records of Rev. W. B.
Clarke, which the Government had
bought some years earlier for
£7OOO.

‘Wo, We will NOT stop for ‘Just a look'!”
Australian Folksongs
All other considerations
aside, the Wattle people are
doing good work in preserving
Australian songs in more-or-
less permanent form. Titled
Folk Songs From Queensland,
the company's latest release
marks Queensland’s Centenary
Year celebrations.
Anyone wishing to see for
himself the text of these songs
can get a copy of the “Queens-
land Centenary Songbook,”
published by Edwards and
Shaw; but the performers
the Bandicoots and the
Moreton Bay Bushwhackers,
two Brisbane groups are
extremely careful about
enunciation. The songbook
contains words of about 20
songs not done on this record ;
and one gets the impression
that, such is the enthusiasm of
the Bandicoots and Bush-
whackers, they'd have gone
right ahead and ,sung the lot
had recording-space permitted.
The stuff performed is just
set down in simple, forthright
style, somewhat in the way
“Duke” Tritton wrote about his
adventures. Whether or not
it is polished, or authentically
representative, or even good
music, seems to be beside the
point. Folk-music must be
judged on the appeal it exerts
on a particular people at a
particular time ; and the histori-
cal perspective is a condition-
ing factor in style of presenta-
tion and choice of instruments.
The fact that these songs
initially were sung and enjoyed,
and now remain, guarantees at
least partial popularity; and,
without worrying about fine
points, we ought to be grate-
ful to groups interested in
singing them. After all, it is
extremely doubtful whether
shearers, sheepwalkers, drovers
or bullockies carried such use-
ful things as tuning-forks, or
spare reeds for squeeze-boxes.
With their usual care, the
Wattle people have printed a
mass of pertinent information
(and a map) on the back of the
jacket, and it is especially
good to read John Manifold’s
comments on the origin and
peculiarities of some of the
song. The Moreton Bay
Bushwhackers, one learns, are
the most publicly active of
Brisbane’s folksong groups;
and they start the record with
“The Freehold On The Plain.”
Here Bill Scott mourns wool
not worth a zack against a
rattling background of guitar,
accordion, washboard, etc. ; he
has a reedy but pleasantly
strong voice, and the tune is
marked by a rolling uncompli-
cated beat. The melody,
incidentally, derives from an
American 19th-century pop.-
song.
Doug Eaton, who with the
help of the Bandicoots sings
“The Queensland Drover,” is
a different sort of singer: his
is a fresher, less matured-in-the-
wood voice. His only accom-
paniment is guitar, and every
now and then a chorus comes
in with the refrain. “The Banks
Of The Condamine” is a ballad
for shearer and his girlfriend,
and a really pleasant tune it is,
too, sung by N. Stewart and
J. Manifold with the Bandi-
coots. Doug Eaton returns to
sing the pithy song “The Ram
Of Dalby” (avoiding, with
deliberate effort, that risque
rhyme halfway through): a
short number, and not as
immediately catchy as the
Condamine song.
From a purely musical view-
point, the most substantial piece
on the record is “Charley
Sailor’s Woman Song”—an
instrumental setting of an
aboriginal song. Over a con-
stant guitar figure a treble and
a tenor recorder weave a
gentle two-strand melody. It
is an appealing bit of music,
with, surprisingly enough, an
English village-green flavor
about it. The rumbustious
“Bullocky-O” is done by the
Bushwhackers ; or, more pro-
perly, Stan Arthur, who sings,
and Bill Steffen, who plays the
banjo— to say nothing of the
people on washboards, bush-
bass (a sort of home-made
double-bass), accordion, etc.,
all combining to provide a
whacking beat.
The second side opens with
Stan Arthur suitably sorrowful
about leaving the “Brisbane
Ladies”; then there is the
“Sheepwasher” song, with
J. Manifold of the Bandicoots,
against a supporting guitar,
voicing hearty sentiments about
ending “bloody cringing pov-
erty” and hoping that Queens-
land will never know “the
tyrant’s ball-and-chain.” Back
come the Bushwhackers with
their orchestra and with solo-
ist G. Hoffer to have a go at
“Wallaby Stew” —an exceed-
ingly jolly affair, the refrain
starting with the bouncing line
“So stir the wallaby-stew.”
Mouth-organs and whistl-
ing are the chief interest in
“Cunnamulla Stocking Jig,”
done by the Bandicoots; a
repetitive tune, and certainly
Irish in its harmonic basis. The
Bushwhackers don’t beat about
the bush in the last two num-
bers: B. Scott captures much
of the rollicking chanty-like
mood of “The Old Palmer
Song,” and in “Billy Shean,” set
to an American tune, he does
just as well.
By and large, all the tunes
have the merit of brevity as
well as raciness; and the
record, besides showing us
something of the Australian
folk-music repertoire, should
be particularly useful for col-
lectors of musical Australiana.

Women’s Letters
SYDNEY
Christmas has come and gone in a
flurry of all sorts of news. Talk at
Christmas-parties veered round to the
tragedy of St. Malo, the beautiful old
home at Hunter’s Hill which is to be
demolished for an expressway, while the
release of the huge tracts of Gfeen Belt
land round Sydney caused many an
angry mutter.
☆ ☆ ☆
There was a good deal of criticism
levelled, too, at the type of decoration
used in the shops for Christmas. Leading
citizens said they were horrified to see
little toy-rats in a shop-window singing
Christmas carols. Well, it doesn’t seem
quite the right thing, but here is a story
left over from Christmas which might
throw a new light on the subject. It is
called, “The Housewife and the Mouse.”
The Housewife first saw the Mouse
as a faint, pale shadow dropping behind
the washing-machine. “I must fish-up
that handkerchief some time,” she said
to herself, though she had a tiny
suspicion that it was something else.
The next time there was no mistake.
The Mouse slid along the back of the
stove with a beautiful swift gliding
motion that Pavlova would have envied,
and the Housewife began to worry. When
she surprised the Mouse sitting on the
linen-cupboard and he froze into a per-
fection of stillness and silence that should
have made him as invisible as he hoped
it did, she thought of ways to destroy
him. The cat from next-door? No. The
advertised poison? No. A mouse-trap?
“Yes,” said the salesgirl, “it’s quite pain-
less. It breaks their backs instantly.”
So the Housewife put the mouse-trap
in her pocket and set-off home. On the
way she stepped into a little church to
have a look at the crib where the Holy
Infant lay in the straw, gazed-at by a
wondering plaster company. What struck
the Housewife was the quietness of it
all after the city streets and shops.
“Silent night,” she thought. “All is calm,
all is bright,” and she thought of the
stillness of the little Mouse, how he was
the most wonderfuly silent thing that
she had ever encountered. And she tip-
toed from the church, ran down the
street and did not rest till she had put
the murderous mouse-trap in a Be-tidy
tin. Her Christmas order included a
quarter of tasty cheese, though her hus-
band never touches it, and the Mouse is

Which is a problem she will have to
cope with in the New Year ; but you see
how difficult it was for her, don’t you?
Author of the delightful children’s
play "Smugglers Beware,” at the Eliza-
bethan Theatre, Eleanor Witcombe
strikes the right note of true childish
enjoyment by writing about the things
that would have amused herself and
her companions when they were
youngsters in Yorketown (S.A.). It is 10
years since, as a youthful student of
drama, she wrote three plays specially
for the Mosman Children’s Theatre.
They were "Pirates at the Barn.” which
was written around the. story of an old
barn at Mosman Bay that had first
fascinated her with the story-possibilities
of Sydney's history; "The Bushranger,”
with which she toured N.S.W. in a pro-
fessional company for the 1951 Com-
monwealth Jubilee; and the present
“Smugglers Beware.” Since then she has
spent five years in London, has returned
to become a successful radio-scriptwriter,
has a children's book ready for editing,
and plans to work on a play for adults
in 1960 — "naturally, with an Australian
setting.”
Miss Witcombe has also collaborated
with John McKellar and Dot Mendoza
in the new children s musical "Ride on
a Broomstick” at the Phillip Street
Theatre , and will set out in January for
a 19-weeks tour of N.S.W. for the Arts
Council. A lively, busy and successful
person, her advice to Australian parents
and teachers is to educate the children
to appreciate (and to be willing to pay
for ) Australian theatre. "As well as giving
them lots of fun,” she says, "if is vitally
important to giving them a sense of
national unity.” And so say all of us!
That was a nice little cocktail-
Christmas-party given by publishers
William Collins in their York Street
eyrie for members of the International
P.E.N. Mr. Fred Howe and president
Maisie Greig welcomed about 50 guests,
who included authors Gwen Meredith,
Elizabeth Harrower, Margaret Dick,
Margaret Trist, Olaf Ruhen and Walter
Stone.

“Where shall we take the children?”
offers several solutions this season, as
far as shows are concerned, for there
are several to choose from, each w'ith
its own special appeal.
For lovers of traditional pantomime
there are “Robin Hood on Ice” at the
Capitol, and “Puss in Boots” at the
Tivoli. In these one can find the
children’s ballets, the acrobatics, the
Principal Boys (who are girls) and the
Dames (who are men), the old gag
(which the children love so much) of
the Dame asking the children to let her
know when some precious belonging is
in danger, the old community singing
(“We all go OOH-Ah-Ah”) and the old
irrelevant once-popular songs. There is
always a good big orchestra, a huge
cast, gay costumes and a lot of noise.
It doesn’t cost much —children can see
it for 2s. —and there are few who don’t
find it great fun.
Yet the appearance of a more subtle
form of entertainment for the youngsters
at professional theatres this year is very
much to be welcomed. The Elizabethan
Theatre has given a very stylish produc-
tion to “Smugglers Beware,” which,
though it lacks the spectacle, has all the
simple boisterous fun that children find
in panto., and a more logical line, which
they appreciate more than some adults
seem to realise.
At the Phillip Street Theatre there is
a beautiful little presentation of “Ride
on a Broomstick,” an adaptation of the
Rapunzel fairytale. Here the compli-
cated movements of the cast really need
a larger stage, but the management of
magical spells and transformations is
quite well done. The costumes are pretty,'
the wit is lively and the whole atmos-
phere one of enchantment. It is very
short, however. Quantity is not its aim.
Quality it has. (Children can see it
from 45.)
A hint to parents and others taking
small fry to theatres is not to give them
the programme to hold. They seem
invariably to spend their time trying to
identify in the dark the photos of the
actors who have just come on to the
stage. They miss the action, but are
triumphant if they can recognise the
right picture!

The bridal gown for Farah Diba, who
was married to the Shah of Persia,
seemed to exceed all bridal gowns. In-
sured for £2OOO, it was made of heavy
delustred satin and was weighed-down
by pearls, rhinestones and silver-em-
broidery. It weighed 331 b. Pictures
show'ed it as a high-waisted gown with
the embroidery concentrated across the
bodice and around the neckline of the
accompanying coat, which was cut away
in the front to show the dress. A band
of white mink bordered the hem and
91t.-long train of the dress. It was
made by French designer Yves St.
Laurent.

The highly original invitation to
Gerard O'Dea’s party was a cut-out
“C” in which nestled a line-drawing of
a turkey, a cray, a cake, bottle and
glasses, indicating that a lot of the best
of things: champagne, chicken, crayfish,
caviare, coffee, casata, chacha, chatter
and “your company” began with that
letter. The party was held at the Toorak
home of Gerard’s brother and sister-in-
law, Mr. and Mrs. R. J. O’Dea. The
latter, who had decorated the reception-
rooms with white and gold angels, white
and gold candles, gold pine-cones and
mixed hydrangeas, wore a smart sheath-
frock of white embroidered Swiss-lawn.
Mr. and Mrs. A. K. O’Dea, the parents
of Gerard, were also present. Gerard,
who has just finished his law course,
invited fellow-graduates and -students,

which were set-up on the tennis-court.
In the large garden were tables with
gay umbrellas, where afternoon-tea was
served, while on the terrace in front
of the house was the “Cafe Rue Da La
Paix,” where coffee and petits fours were
served. In the ballroom, tables were
set for a festive dinner-party. Mrs. James
Buchanan set hers with a red-and-white
embroidered table-cloth and red glass-
ware. Mrs. Dowd did a Christmas-
corner for baby. In a tall white-curtained
bassinet, trimmed with blue ribbon,
was her own baby, while a musical-box
softly played Christmas-carols. Among
the mothers who stocked the stalls were
Mrs. Arthur Wilkes, Mrs. Geoffrey

tho baby, went to stay with Ruby
Chappie, who used to be a star in
vaudeville; and Ruby, when she was
going to drown herself, was rescued by a
steeplejack named Young Frosty.
Frosty, working high in the air above
Sydney, saw through a window the
paralysed girl Veronica and fell in love
with her. . . and somebody who was
connected with this story knew Father
McGovern, and Father McGovern
knew Spitz the bottle-oh who went to
sleep in the church when he was drunk
and frightened the boy who was trying
to rat the poor-box so that he ran out
and got his leg broken ; and somehow
that brings you to Big Lew who once
hanged a man for a tenner in Dario
Jail and now wants to put the blame
of murdering Father McGovern (who
recovers) onto young Jackie . . .
It sounds a muddle; but oddly
enough, it isn’t. It is a story of lives
linked by relationship and friendship
and propinquity and coincidence, the
way lives are linked in any b'ig city. If
the connections are sometimes thin and
far-fetched and if you lose sight of the
central characters so that the novel
lacks form and continuity, it can be
taken simply as a collection of short-
stories, each vaguely connected with the
next. The ultimate intention is to paint
a picture of Sydney, the teeming metro-
polis full of human drama; and in that
way, to the extent that you can accept
the picture, the experiment is wholly
successful.
Niland’s picture is too highly colored,
too overcharged with sentimentality
and vulgarity to be altogether accept-
able. Waifs, strays, priests, criminals,
boxers, bottle-ohs, steeplejacks; old,
roaring. Rabelaisian lovers, sadists
with broken bottles, paralysed girls
and old vaudeville stars with hearts of
gold, his people in the end seem more
like demons and angels, like fairies
and' monsters in a pantomime, than
anybody you would really meet walk-
ing about the streets. His stories are
not dramas but melodramas. But there
is something Dickensian in his view-
point. It is the authentic Sydney of
the slums—
She pulled the blind. It banged
up and the window framed a con-
gestion of hovels with toy backyards,
stone lavatories, and a cross-hatch
of clothes-lines.
“Delaightful,” she breathed.
“Ravishing.”—
caught up into a wild sort of semi-
poetic rhapsody, half-true, half-over-
heated ; full, at least, of energy and
robustness and of skilful storytelling.
Malayan Emergency
There’s honor among thieves —so
I’ll start by confessing that the heroes
of the book here reviewed are officers
and men of my former regiment and
its author my brother-officer and
personal friend.
The subject of Shoot to Kill, by
Richard Miers (Faber), is the campaign
against Communist terrorists in
Malaya, which has been going on now
for nearly twelve years. Like any other
limited war which drags on far away,
the Malayan Emergency has long
ceased to be headline news. But, as
distances go nowadays, Malaya isn’t
very far north of Darwin, and anything
happening there is bound to have an
effect on Australia’s future. The cam-
paign is also worth deep study by
statesmen and soldiers of all free
nations; because so far Malaya has
been the only part of the world where
Communists have been met in open
fight and beaten conclusively. In a
chapter entitled “What makes them
tick,” Brigadier Miers has given an
excellent and practical description of
the workings of the Communist mind.
Australian and New Zealand troops,
as well as the redoubtable warriors
from Fiji, are taking part in the anti-
Communist operations, and our
military-forces base their training-for-
war on lessons learned in the campaign.
So an account of the fighting in Malaya
by an unorthodox but conspicuously
successful commander is bound to be
of military importance. The impact is
greater when such an account is
written with good humor but without
equivocation. Describing the action
against Goh Peng Tuan (political com-
missar of Number 5 Independent
Platoon of the Communist Terrorist
Organisation) when Miers used a new
technique of calling for R.A.F.
bombardment of a small camp against
the advice of his General, who “never
interfered with his Commanding
Officers,” he writes:—
The second message arrived as we
were trying to digest the first. The

Moon-levee. This dame’s weighty yellow
jowl
And precipitous brows invite a wild dog’s
howling.
For hours under her flag I must set
course,
Take countless soundings of the giant
horses,
While ocean coughs her noncommittal
oath.
Again the fibroid wind -and scrub choir
nothing
Knit in falsetto and raggedy bass tonight,
And rallying moonward are embryonic
lightnings,
Whispers of thunder, a tattered populace.
I Baxter and our three gentiles, let your
faces
Evacuated in fluid sleep be brave,
And orderly, and cavernous.
Sleep can hardly disarm the trudging five
Of us, nor resolve the mystery of our
living:
We are one mind, one body even ; and
the wired
Claws of thirst, unskilled fists of tiredness
Have over month and mile raised our
fiveway bridge.
Words of Baxter, civil sing-song of our
aboriginals,
Habit, and hunger, and wearing sole of
boot
Lay open the bight of my soul to a
groping beauty.
I brush a fly from my head: five men
wjll watch
The death of that wicked concept, as
one nation.
So any hand lifted has this peculiar force.
Moonlight, and the big elusive horses.
Single drumbeat of thunder and
abhorrent light:
My skull is of rebellion and is
frightened. . .
Wylie, where have you sprung from,
what do you say ?
I must go to a rare country with this
stranger,
Cross an inhuman acre to sleep and
forget.
O my warm gentle desert! —a squall
threatens.
Well, Baxter, here you lie, bleeding and
inert,
Across the yellow moon is drawn a
curtain.
Your sleep is in a manner mine, I tell
you, but a thin
Merciful moonshine turns away from
our window :
After her, after her, tramping, taking
wing . . .
Or, dolt, poltroon, breathe so my brain
tingles
To monotonous urgent lifelines of our
path,
So, before God, we are again together.
You are dead. And two other parts of
man have fled.
Is there life in my slack fingers to cross
the ledger ?
That game left foot will always somehow
limp,
My friend, lie spotless there and very
simple.
Your pain and your great patience in the
dream
Are working oddly over the Bight and
gleaming.
Transfixed in fear and loneliness I burn.
Maimed my brain, maimed my limbs.
And a journey —
Daybreak, snigger of dawn. I am alone.

FRANCIS WEBB.


General, it said, was arriving by
air in an hour and wanted an up-to-
date report on the progress of the
operation. Since the General had
never really been in favor of attack-
ing the camp from the air, it was
with something of the feeling which
follows eating a green apple against
advice that I went down to the
aerodrome to meet him.
He heard my report in dismal
silence. I stood-by for fireworks or
a homily ;• I didn’t know him then as
well as I do now.
“Better luck next time. Comrade,”
was all he said, and with a wave of
his hand was back in his aircraft and
away.
As he took-off a signaller came
running towards me. Breathlessly
he blurted-out the news ; the camp
had been found with 13 dead bodies
in it and on one man’s wrist was a
watch looted from a dead Fiji
major. Goh Peng Tuan was dead.
There’s a lot for soldiers to learn
from Miers’ out-of-the-ordinary tactics
—constant use of helicopters to fly
troops in and out of the jungle; the
bold idea of sending his assault-
pioneers, under my cousin Philip
Worrall, a day ahead to blow-down
enough trees to make a landing-zone;
the masterly ambush of Ming Lee. I
shouldn’t be surprised to find all these
brain-waves coming out eventually as
amendments to “Infantry Training
Volume IV,” but they sound so much
better the way Miers describes them —•
he has written the story of an infantry
battalion and, instead of turning it into
a regimental history or a military text-
book, has kept it colorful and readable,
Rollo Gillespie.
A Nip of Irish
It is never wise for an author to
attack his prospective reviewers.
Reviewers are sensitive souls, con-
tinually exposed to the savagery of
authors, and should always be treated
soothingly. But in The Godstone and
the Blackymor (Cape), T. H. White
makes his points so clearly and accur-
ately that there will surely be few
reviewers who could take either hurt
or umbrage. His book, he says,
will be cruelly reviewed in an exclusive
little magazine called “The Falconer”
by somebody who has scarcely troubled
to read it—if he can read —but who
wishes to establish that he is a better
falconer than I am —not a difficult thing
to establish. In the review each of my
mistakes, which I have carefully pointed
out, will be as carefully and tauntingly
brought to my attention.
The occasion for these tears is when,
having recently lost his eyasses through
a similar rashness, White tries to fly his
peregrine like a merlin. You don’t fly
peregrines from the glove. You just
throw them away into the air and they
go up and up. And really, disarming
though his' defence may be, how any-
body could try to fly a peregrine from
the glove, when she was held to it by
her jesses, passes this reviewer’s com-
prehension. No wonder the poor bird
bated in the hot air. panting with rage,
her beak open, frowning upon him
with her burnt-umber eye . . . and
then took off and disappeared. It is
enough to make a reviewer bate, pant,
frown and disappear likewise.
However, it must be admitted that
“The Godstone and the Blackymor”
is not essentially a book about
falconry, so such errors may readily
be forgiven. Indeed, it is difficult to
say what the book is about. The
author himself says he doesn’t know.
It is about the “Godstone,” cer-
tainly, and this is a stone idol, or
perhaps a saint’s pillow, shaped like
a woman or perhaps a smoothing-iron,
which the peasants and fishermen on
the island of Inniskea used to dress
in a new suit each year and did or did
not worship until a priest did or did
not throw it into the sea. It is, in
fact, a great deal too much about the
Godstone, for if a little antiquarian
research is a pleasant thing in a book
about falconry, or not about falconry,
page after page of antiquarianism over
such an insignificant object is hardly
fair tactics.
It is about the “Blackymor,” too,
and the blackymor is a negro whom
the author unexpectedly encountered
in an Irish village and whom, the black
man being skilled in such matters
from his practice at the fairs, he took
to massage the rheumatism out of an
old farmer. But again it is much too
much about the blackymor; for if a
negro in Ireland is an oddity, he is
not such an oddity as to justify several
thousand words and the title of a
book.
But, then, on the whole, “The God-
stone and the Blackymor” is not a
book about Godstones and blackymors
any more than it is a book about
falconry. It is, simply, a book about
shooting and fishing and giants and
fairies and people, on the wild, stony,
peaty west coast of Ireland; and as
such it is altogether charming. It is
the sort of thing that, if both writers
will forgive so unforgiveable a com-
parison, Robert Gibbings has done
with equal inconsequence and solidity.
It is about the ale-colored streams
filled with enormous salmon which
you can’t catch because they won’t
bite until there is a flood; and the old
houses lost among rhododendrons and
fuchsias; and the cairn which marks
the spot where Young Donn had been
killed in the year 1230 fighting the
foreigners, one of whom “would drive
his lance into him occasionally”; and
the religious sheep which carried the
stones to help St. Tean build his
church; and the terrible folk-song
called “The Pride of Inniskea” which
yet has some lovely lines in it; and
the village streets filled with fighters
and cowpats after the market-day; and
the great night the McMennamins
netted the salmon in the estuary, the
“taut, brown sinewy, speechless,
taciturn hunters” bursting into “a wild
hilarity of barbarism” as they leapt
at the huge fish with their clubs; and
the cottagers who grew a fungus under
a glass dome; and the old man who
thought he was a parrot and sang all
day in his bed; and the family who
entertained the author royally on their
only egg; and what it is like to spend
a night all alone in the ruined huts
of an island abandoned since the ten
fishermen were drowned; and the good
Catholics who, because animals have
no souls, say, when they enter a
dwelling, “God save all here, barring
the dog and the cat”; and the fifteen-
thousand pilgrims, the author among
them, who climbed the mountain of
St. Patrick.
Neither sentimentalised nor loaded
with the harsher unreality of sociology,
the book is a beautifully authentic
picture of Ireland. The rocks, the
heath, the peat, the salmon, the people
and the whisky all taste exactly right;
and if it is marred a little by some
spinning-out of the material and by
the regrettable mistakes in falconry,
this reviewer—who wouldn’t know a
hawk from a handsaw —nevertheless
enjoyed every moment of it.
