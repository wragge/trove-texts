From Australia.
Mr. W. H. Price, of Wells Silver Mine,
Emmaville, N. S. W„ writes as follows;
.“To W. H. Soul k CO., (Agents for Dr.
Pierce’s Belts and Trusses), 158 Pitt St.,
Sydney: Sirs:—l am in receipt of Belt
and books of instruction, and can safely
say that your advertisements are very truthful in regard to
the statement that a man feels the electrical strength Of
the belt as soon as it is placed on his body, for I felt the effect
of the belt as soon as I placed it on, and believe me, 1 am
a sure advocate of this belt.” _
From England. .
Mr. Chas. Middleton, of No. 76 Aston St Birmingham,
speaksas follows; “I can say that I havefelt better, a great
deal, since I have used your Galvanic Chain Belt, and I
thank you very much. I have taken patent medicines but
I shall not take any more. You can usb my name in praise
of your Belt.” From America. 1 J
Mr J. W.POHLMAN, Tacoma, U. S. A., writes—“ Your No,
3 Galvanic Chai’n Belt has done what.a Whole A rug store
could not do, for it has cured me of Sciatic Rheumatism
and Weak Back, also, which came On through a fall into, a
ship’s hold some ten years ago. I fell 18 feet on my back,
and although I got upas i f nothing had happened, the back
troubled me ever since Until I tried your belt. Far one year

The Member for Smith's Curse.
The subdivision of New South Wales into
single electorates, under the provisions of
the new manhood-suffrage system, will pro-
duce one nefarious result which, perhaps,
was not foreseen by the promoters of the
innovation—it will greatly increase and
multiply that numerous and old-established
evil, the member for the electorate of
Smith’s Curse. Or it may be that this result
was foreseen, and that many of those who
Voted for the single electorate system did so
because they desired to foster this variety
of politician for their own purposes. The
electorate of Smith’s Curse and its member
may be found all over the Austraiias. They
are both the embodiment of the spirit of
parochialism, and represent the “ road and
bridge interest” pure and simple. Almost
every New South Wales country electorate
belongs, more or less, to this order ; also a
good many other electorates as well. The
want of a Local Government system makes
every district dependent on the Legislature
for roads, bridges, culverts, drains, and
every other kind of public work. And this
state of things has created a peculiar variety
of member—the politician who knows practi-
cally nothing of political economy, tariffs,
law, grammar, or anything whatever that his
position should require, but who is filled
with a bull dog resolution to get a new
bridge or gaol or court-house for his own
God forgotten district of Smith’s Curse, and
who will vote for any measure introduced
by any Government which gives him his
bridge or gaol, and against any measure
introduced by any Government which
doesn’t.
* * #
The member in question is generally a
popular tradesman or petty lawyer or land-
and-cattle jobber who has largely advertised
himself in connection with “lodge" and
municipal affairs. He speaks louder than
anybody else, holds stronger and more un-
grammatical opinions about the need for a
local railway, and with these things and his
unconcealed liberality in small matters, he
inevitably rises to be Mayor. And in his
capacity as Mayor he harries the local mem-
ber into a premature grave with his demands
for Government works, and between this and
the fact that his bloodstained log of mutton
is al ways forthcoming in any case of distress
he soon becomes the most popular man in
the district; Therefore, when he stands for
Parliament, his eleccum is almost sure and
his after-position practically unassailable.
# # *
Under the system of single electorates his
election will probably be even more sure
in the future. The division of a large elec-
torate into three or four small ones narrows
the circle round the prospective member’s
butchery-establishment, so that his voice*
and the thud with which he planks down
his donation of meat, can be better heard
throughout the constituency. Also, it
simplifies local politics, for with a vastly
smaller electorate it is so much the easier to
remember what roads* bridges, and culverts
"are wanted—and the position of the candi-
date who can remember every ciilvert in his
constituency is as nearly as possible im-
pregnable. But while the new system will
inevitably make the road-and-bridge poli-
tician more numerous his character will
remain unchanged. He will be the member
for Smith’s Curse, and nothing else, to the
end of his days—a bull-headed person who
is prepared to vote for almost any iniquity so
long as he gets an equivalent in the shape of
some new white elephant for his consti-
tuency*
• * #
It is the existence of this variety of poli-
tician and the want of any visible remedy
for him that causes Thu Bulletin to advo-
cate the retention of the Upper House as an
elective body chosen by the whole province
voting as one constituency. To retain the
Council on its present basis is useless. That
body never does anything, and it never
definitely prevents anything being done ; it
makes it necessary to pass every important
measure of reform through the Assembly
three or four times before its slow and
ancient fossils are scared into submission and
succumb to the popular will, but it always
submits in the end if the popular will is
reasonably strong, and its only use is to
cause much friction and a hideous waste of
time. Yet its abolition would merely leave
the country almost entirely at the mercy of
the member for the desolate wastes of
Smith’s Curse, and its establishment on the
same manhood suffrage basis as the Assembly
would only make it the duplicate of that body.
The road-and-bridge politician would pervade
both Houses equally, and there would be the
same incessant grinding of the same axe in
each Chamber. Again, the so-called “reform”
of the Council, by making it an elective
institution on the basis of a property qualifi-
cation, would be a worse evil than any of the
others. It would then be the representative
of wealth just as it is now, and would consist
of the same ancient Tories as at present ; but
whereas a Democratic Government can
always influence the nominee Chamber by
threatening to swamp it with new members,
the elective Chamber would be impervious
to all outside pressure, and—unless coerced
by violence—could reject every Democratic
measure with impunity till the crack of doom.
# # #
Under the system which The Bulletin
advocates the two Houses would be equally
representative of the people, though in dif-
ferent ways, and between them they would,
this paper is firmly convinced, voice the will
of the nation more effectually than under any
method yet attempted. They might then be
entrusted with equal power, though the bal-
ance of authority would inevitably gravitate,
by slow degrees, to the Upper Chamber.
The latter would contain every politician
who was sufficiently well-known and of suffi-
ciently good repute—or even of sufficiently
bad repute—to command a considerable fol-
lowing, notonly in hisown districtbut through-
out the country ; while the Assembly would
as heretofoi’e, contain the local politician—•
that member for the constituency of Smith’s
Curse who is ahvays with us. If that indi-
vidual were fit for better tilings he would,
in course of become a national instead
of a local politician, and attain to a seat in
the Upper House ; if not, he would remain
the member for Smith’s Curse and nothing
more to the end of his days. The chief
reason why the Lower House need be re-
tained at all, under such circumstances, is
that nearly every member must necessarily
be at the first a politician of local reputa-
tion only, until he lias shown sufficient
force of character whether good or
bad character is a matter which only
slightly affects the question —to attract
the suffrages of a wider constituency. The
line of demarcation would be practically
between the strong men and the weak ones
'Plie pettifogging scoundrel and the good
man who was eminently fitted to adorn a
very small tea-meeting would be the main
component parts of" the one Chamber ; the
larger scoundrel, and the good man who
was capable of leading a crusade instead of a
bun-struggle, would make up the other.
This is not by any means an ideal system of
division, but in this strangely rudimentary
and unfinished world it is probably about the
best that can be devised.
The Foreign Invasion.
James Joseph Dalton, Esquire, of King’s Inn,
Ireland, and Reginald Malet de Cahtehkt,
Esquire, of the Inner Temple, England, were
admitted as barristers by the New South Wales
Supreme Court, on Saturday week. They are
now duly accredited members of the union, and
can dispense New South Wales law without
any risk of being fined and admonished and
made to pay costs “ for the protection of the
public.” The blackleg who carries the freedom-
of-contract principle into the legal shearing-
shed is always thrown out heavily on to
his head “for the protection of the public.”
He may know the law, but then again he
may not, and it would not do to Jet the poor
Confiding public run any risk. So he is meta-
phorically bumped against and blue-metalled;
and kicked behind the ear, and the fragments
that remain are gathered up into seven baskets
and thrown violently down a steep place into
the sea. Now; for the protection of the public;
we wish to know what guarantee there is that
Mr. Dalton and Mr. de Carteret know any-
thing at all about the New Smith Wales law of
which they have been matje the authorised ex-
ponents. The Court didn’t take any trouble to
ascertain whether they do or not. If they had
been merely men brought up in Australia,
who had studied law on the spot;
they would have had to serve a long pro-
bationary period, and pass sundry examinations,
and pay numerous fees; and produce certificates
of good character, and be liable to be harassed
with all manner of extraordinary regulations.
But being J. J. Dalton, Esquire, of King’s
Inn, Ireland, and R. M. De Carteret, Esquire,
of the Inner Temple, England; nothing of the
sort is expected of them. The Court wouldn’t
be so uncivil as to ask any unpleasant questions.
If the gentlemen from King’s Inn, Ireland, and
the Inner Temple, England, do the province
the honour of becoming members of its bar ;
why, cer-tainly, “Do you move Mr. Dalton ?
Do you move Mr. De Carteret? Isn’t there
a vacant Crown Prosecutorship, Mr. Attorneys
General ? ”
* * *
The same Court which thus welcomed these
two distinguished foreign gentlemen to the Bar
then proceeded to deal with the application of
a mere common Australian to be admitted to
practice as a solicitor. We don’t know him,
but we gather from the context that he is an
Australian. This presumptuous individual,
Henry Wesley Lovett by name, bad not, it
seems, gone to England to get the genuine
18-carat hall-mark. The reason for this neglect
on his part we do not know. Perhaps he did
not want to go; perhaps he couldn’t afford to
go ; perhaps he simply thought that as he pro-
posed to make a living by the practice of New
South Wales law in New South Wales, there
was no particular sense in studying on the other
side of the world where he wouldn’t learn any
New South Wales law. He accordingly paid
a fee and passed an examination at the
University, and articled himself to a solicitor,
and probably paid a big premium, and was
solemnly introduced to two Judges, who in-
spected him and approved of him; then lie filed
his articles at the Supreme Court and paid
another fee, and then he served five long years
of apprenticeship, and learned as many of the
mysteries of court practice as his head would
hold, and made out innumerable bills of costs,
and passed a lot more examinations, and paid a
lot more fees, and then, when his five years
had expired, he posted up notices in the Court,
setting forth that Henry Wesley Lovett,
therein described with all the particularity
of a passport and a Hebrew bill -of - sale
combined, was about to make application,
on the last day of term, to be admitted
as an attorney, solicitor, and proctor of this
honourable Court. Then he filed a batch of
papers, and swore many affidavits, and paid
more fees, and produced certificates and tabu-
lated returns compiled by various householders
of his acquaintance to prove that he was a
proper young man who didn’t stay out late at
night and was quite a fit person to be admitted
as an attorney, &c., of this honourable Court.
Finally, on Saturday last aforesaid, being the
last day of term, he turned up at this honour-
able Court with one pocket-full of money to pay
still more fees, and enough in the other, we
trust, to celebrate the occasion with a bottle of
gingerbeer and a bun ; and then, as we said at
the commencement of this paragraph, the
Court proceeded to deal with the application
for his admission.
• * #
Now, one of the things Henry Wesley
Lovett should have done, according to the
rules, was to advertise three times in two
daily papers the fact that he was going to
apply for admission. What, in fact, he did
was to advertise three times in the S.M.
Herald, twice in the Telegraph, once in
the News, and once in the Star. Anyone
who wanted to forbid the banns had
ample opportunity of getting notice of the
ceremony. But their majesties of the Siipreme
Court were not satisfied. There was nothing
against Lovett’s character, there was no
objection to him on the ground that he had not
a competent knowledge of the law, his only de-
linquencies—except that he had put two adver-
tisements in the evening papers instead of one
in the Daily Telegraph— was his being an
Australian, and not a gentleman from King’s Inn,
Ireland, or Inner Temple, England. But “for
the protection of, the public ” —at least we sup-
pose that is what it was for—he was refused
admission, and will have to wait till the end of
November before lie can apply again. In the
meantime he will have more fees to pay.
* * #
But if James Joseph Dalton, Esquire, of
King’s Inn, Ireland, or Reginald Malet de
Carteret, Esquire, of the Inner Temple, Eng-
land, should now desire to be admitted as a
solicitor, no beastly difficulty of that sort would
be thrown in his way. There would be no
necessity for him to wait till the end of
November. On any day the Court sat, he
would only have to intimate his desire, and the
thing would be done forthwith. He would
have no articles to serve, no examination to pass,
no papers to file, no notice to give, no advertise-
ment to put in, no affidavit to swear, no certifi-
cate of character to produce, no fees to nay,
“ no nothing.”

Australia is a great country—for Foreigners.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Gas and Gaiters.
It is painful to learn, per cable, that the cere-
mony of creating “ Edinburgh ” into Duke of
Saxe-Coburg was “brilliant aild impressive.”
The man himself is neither of these things, nor
is there anything remarkable about his succeed-
ing to a petty German dukedom in the same
way that many a brighter nephew succeeds to
bis uncle’s grocery-store* The brilliancy and
impressiveness lay in the precious ceremony;
observe. As Premier Patterson lately gave it
away; the fiction of royal and vice-royal great-
ness “is built upon ceremonial.” The Efliperor
of Germany and suite clank to this occasion in
full tig, a panorama of gaudy uniforms and
jewelled orders forms the background, and the
whole show strikes aw T e to the squl of a news-
paper reporter whose business it is to be struck
as aforesaid* That’s all. Saxe-Coburg knows
little and cares less about its new duke. A
commonplace, stingy, stout person (who, while
a British naval-officer of high rank, has pub-
licly sworn allegiance to the Emperor of
Germany); being one of a little clique of
hereditary blood-suckers, dumps himself-dowm
on a throne by family arrangement, where-
upon cannons are discharged, and the attend-
ing crowd of masqueraders , cry “Hoch!”
or something of that sort; A good deal of bogus
glory has been reflected upon Edinburgh;
Then he retires to his private room to practise
on the fiddle, and once more proves himself
unqualified to scrape out a living for himself by
performing outside the pubs of his loyal people.
What a horrible fraud it all is ! We sneer at
the successful soap-boiler who employs six foot-
men in gaudy liveries to stand in the hall and
make him look mighty. The soap-boiler is a
snob, simply because he emulates the display of
people who play exactly the same game with
money provided for them by the wire-pullers of
a foolish State. Royal ceremonial is a bloated
monopoly, observe also. If a prodigiously
wealthy soap-boiler were to start a Court, pay
for his own “ splendid ” processions, and order
cannon-firing on his birthday, the Government
would promptly suppress the vulgar beast.
“ The Bulletin’s ” Bloodstained Corres
pendent.
The Bulletin has received from “John John-
ston,” of Sydney, the following somewhat
eloquent remarks -
Since when did The Bulletin become the advocate of
scoundrelism and cowardice? It was always my impres-
sion that your organ was the open and avowed foe of
every sort of fraud, evil doing and all iniquity ; whether
as exemplified by the rich squatter, the Prime Minister,
the costermonger, or the thief. It seems to me that your
tone has changed, and that you hold a brief for the larri-
kin, the coward, and the murderer.
Just look at two of your articles in your issue of August
20, on page 4. In “ Plain English ” you fall foul of the
S.M. Herald for some richly-deserved remarks on a gross
miscarriage of justice. Do you really know what you
were writing about when you wrote the article? A vile
young coward deliberately, in open court, took off his
heavy, coarse hoot, and with violence flung it at the head
of a witness, hitting so as to endanger his very life. (By
the way, had you been that witness and got the blow, you
would have sung a different tune.) And yet you are
absolutely silly enough to say that for such a murderous
attack he got too severe a sentence. Why, had the brute
been flogged to death it would not have been too much.
Away with your damned cant—he honest for once.
Again, look at the vile article on same page, “ Pushism
Exploded.” Here again sympathy with crime. Would
to God some editor were kicked to death by ruffians—
then we might hear less of these mealy-mouthed apologies
for murder ! ! If ever a case demanded summary justice
on tire vile and cowardly crowd, it was the “ Pert Case.”
If ever a set of vile ruffians deserved flogging, hanging
and flaying alive—it was that set.
Oh, for an hour of one of my American cities! We
would make the murderers of the poor fellow sit up ; we
would make the jurors shake in their shoes ; and we would
make the Judges tremble. The two old women of Judges
who had the case before them ought to be confined and
fed on pap. Would we had a Judge of grit and justice.
Now, Mr. Editor, I had thought you would have been
the very first to have taken up the tone of this letter in
all the press of Sydney. As it is, I must only give you
up, and say that your praise is blame, your blame praise,
or, to quote a great poet, applying the line to your organ :
“ High praise it is of such to he dispraised.”
The Bulletin loves this kind of correspondent.
It loves him for his madness, and his picturesque
bigotry, and his frank, unvarnished, irredeem-
able brutality, and his cheerful cannibalism, and
the chunk of human flesh which, in a manner of
speaking, he always holds in his dripping jaws,
and the wolf-like howl of his language. Also,
it loves him for his utter want of logic. “ A
vile young coward deliberately, in open court,
took off his heavy, coarse boot, and, with vio-
lence, flung it at the head of a witness, hitting
him so as to endanger his very life.” Therefore,
Mr. Johnston, being worked up to frenzy by his
own adjectives, wants the prisoner “ flogged to
death.” Yet it was only a common, trivial
assault after all. The offender wasn’t one-tenth as
cowardly as the big member of Parliament who
hits the little member in the lobby, or the man
who beats bis wife —there are thousands of him,
yet Mr. Johnston doesn’t howl in the press
about his brutality—because they both com-
mit their assaults with the almost certain
knowledge that they won’t be even fined,
while Connors knew that his escape was
absolutely impossible and punishment, of some
sort or other, certain. The fact that he
“ deliberately ’’ took off his boot, doesn’t make
the offence any worse than if he took off his
boot with great velocity, and the fact that it
was done in “ open court ” is no more brutal or
horrible than if it was done in a hotel. Also,
the boot wasn’t necessarily “ heavy” or
“coarse” —that is a mere effort of John-
ston’s hysterical imagination, and the con-
cussion didn’t endanger anybody’s life —in
fact, it hardly left a perceptible bruise.
Also, as regards the Pert case, Mr. Johnston’s
kindly longing that an editor may be kicked to
death seems irrelevant in view of the fact that
seven doctors could find no traces of kicks upon
Pert’s remains—though a Sydney paper of the
Johnston variety announced that he had been
booted till bis bowels protruded. And John-
ston’s yell for “an hour of one of my American
cities” seems more irrelevant even than the
rest, seeing that there are more murders and far
more unpunished murderers in the United
Stalci than in any other civilised country on
earth. Johnston is evidently a “ right-thinking
person ”of an advanced type. Considering his
yearning to have Connors “ flogged to death ’
for throwing a boot at somebody. The Bulle-
tin will be glad to know what he thinks should

have happened to that eminently respectable
bank-manager at Broken Hill who mashed
Sleath’s head with the office ruler. Also what
variety of horror would he have called down on
Haynes, M. L.A., when he banged Chick in the

pen-name. If it is, then Mr. Johnson’s real
name is probably Lynch.

Gallows Eloquence.
The execution of Conher, in Melbourne Gaol,
emphasised the truth of cynicism’s remark that
the “ moral ’of a hanging is enforced by lying
newspaper reports. If the real story'of'the
miserable business were told by the pressmen
deputed to “do” it there would be a speedy
reaction of public feeling in favour of the
corpse, and the glory of capital punishment
would soon pass away. The reporter sees little,
and realises less, but as much of the spectacle
as photographs itself upon his mind causes him
to leave the prison with a hearty disgust for
the law. So mean a thing is the hanging law
that all the parties employed in putting it
through, with the solitary” exception of the
hangman (even he and his assistant, ashamed of
their hideous occupation, disguise themselves in
false beards, &c.) turn away from their nominal
responsibility as though ashamed of themselves.
Not one of them, save the hangman, but would
give the creature on the drop his natural term
of life if they had the power. The Sheriff and
gaol authorities feel only the ignominy of
calling upon a pallid scarecrow—-a “guy,” as
Deeming termed himself—to come forth with
his arms pinioned behind his back, and be
coldbloodedly slaughtered. The warders, pre-
sent for the supposed purpose of keeping order
and seeing that the scarecrow doesn’t escape,
are turned in an instant to sympathisers with
the “poor devil.” Only the hangman and a
few morbid, unprofessional visitors take a plea-
sure in the show, and are glad to be there.
Society, however, demands that a hanging shall
look horribly impressive, instead of hideously
contemptible, in print, and the newspaper
reporters .meet this demand. The chief his-
torians for each journal write up the subject,
picturing an execution as the world thinks it
ought to be. Of late there has sprung up a
casual paragraphist who chips into another part
of the paper with a fact or two flatly contra-
dicting the romance writer and giving the old
game clean away. Take the Standard’s “ full
and particular details ” of the Conder killing—
“ Then Conder ’ (a paralytic, who was probably
insane) “emerged, &c., &c. For the first time
since his ride through the city en route to the
gaol, he gazed on strangers, &c., &c. On he
came lifting his feet with that treadle-like
motion which becomes a habit to men inured to
the wearing of chains, &c., &c. There he stood
on the brink of the dark gulf of eternity. The
hangman dropped the noose over his neck, &c.,
&c. ‘John Conder, have you anything to
say ? ’ asked the Sheriff. The swaying figure,
&c., and gasped ‘ No, sir.’ The chaplain stood
nearer to the dying man. With a low subdued
voice he commenced to read, the., Ac. ‘Man,’
the chaplain went on, ‘ man that is horn of a
woman —-—’ Here the Sheriff bent his hand.
The obedient hand of the executioner pressed
the lever,” &c., &c., &c. Take the Argus
report. “ Then Mr. Scott commenced to
recite the service for the dead. He had
not completed the first sentence, etc., when
the bolt was drawn.” Contrast with these
yarns a par. from the Standard —“ By a
humane arrangement the prayers were com-
pleted just as the condemned man reached the
drop, and as he replied ‘No, sir,’ to the Sheriff’s
question, the work was done.” Also, note the
Age’s report —“Instead of testing the nerves
of tlie condemned man with an agonising in-
terval upon the scaffold, whilst the burial
service is read, Mr. Ellis arranged that the
service should be read in the cell, so that from
the moment the convict left his cell until the
demands of justice were complete (sic), scarcely
two minutes elapsed.” There you have the
story of Conder’s execution, without literary
trimmings. It wasn’t an appalling ceremonial,
but a hasty, degrading work of destruction,
and the moral of it lies in the fact that Conder
declared himself innocent of tire murder he was
hanged for.

Farkes on a “ Principle.”
Parkes makes a pitiable effort to explain his
position re the Referendum. Because he lives
by mixing and muddling up the issues he long
ago declared against that system. Then, being
unable to decide whether it was safer to
declare for or against payment of members, he
announced that he was willing to leave that
one question to a public vote, and now he
endeavours to explain how his desire for the
Referendum in this one instance is quite con-
sistent with his opposition to it in every other
instance;—
There is hardly any question so simple, and so settled,
and 8 o definitely put within fixed limits as to be sub-
mitted to me or you or anybody else for a “ yes ” or a
no.” But it seems to me that payment of members is
exactly in the shape that no other question is. And for
this obvious reason: We have had Parliaments without
payment of members, and the electors have been able to
see them, and we have had Parliaments with payment of
members, and the electors have been able to see
them, so that they have had both sides of the
question, under the authority of the law, put to them in
a practical light. They can more readily say “ yes ”or
no,” therefore, than they can on any other question
that I can think of. Even the fiscal question is a much
more complicated one. Almost any question—even
woman’s suffrage—could not be so readily submitted as
payment of members, because there are persons who are
'h, 0111 ' of g ’ v ing votes to one class of women and not to
others. Almost all questions that come within the range
°t politics are more or less capable of being modified, but
payment of members, as far as the principle goes, is before
Rm electors.
precisely ! And Protection, Federation, the
Land-tax, woman’s suffrage, and everything
else, so far as the principle goes, are also before
ifche electors. The electors can give a “ yes ”or
ho ” on the principle of Protection as readily
fts °h that of payment of members. And if the
answer is “yes,” then they can vote a 20, 30,
£0 °p 50 per cent, tariff just as they prefer
~~therc is absolutely no difficulty about the
case. They could decide the principle of the
Land-tax, and also, if necessary, the amount of
ff with equal ease. Moreover, even if the diffi-
culty of getting a decisive “Yes” or “No”
bom the con- fry on any question were as great
as Parkes affirms, the Referendum would still
be a lot more definite than the other method of
settling questions—or rather leaving them
unsettled—-by turning Parkes loose to lecture
on things in general through the back-blocks,
and to hold forth indefinitely on everything
beneath the sun. The old man’s real difficulty
is that he wants to support payment of mem-
bers and dish Reid and Dibbs, and scoop in the
Democratic vote, but, not having sufficient
room to turn in, the only alternative is to
“ leave it to the people.” And it is about the
only political thing which was light enough
to carry away that Parkes has ever left to
anybody.
♦
A few days ago that quietly-pushing warrior,
Victoria’s son, Connaught, was appointed to
the command of the British military district of
Aldershot, The London press announces that
this is merely a preliminary to his appointment
as Commander-in-Chief, when age and increas-
ing infirmities induce the obese Field-Marshal
Camp to abdicate his office ; and as that ludi-
crous incumbrance has long been in the sere-
and-yellow leaf, Connaught, in all probability,
will not have long to wait for his inheritance,
Ihe rise of the present Commander-in-Chief
was entirely owing to the fact that the sluggish
blood of the Guelphs was in his veins ; his
other qualifications were that he was dull,
ignorant and devoid of military experience, and
that on the only occasion when he was under
fire he well, emphatically did not distinguish
himself, Connaught’s dullness is also reputedly
of a massive order, and he has been about once
under fire—when Wolseley slaughtered the
wretched Egyptians. Connaught’s elevation
over the heads of hundreds of his experienced
seniors is explained by the Government, as
arising entirely through the difficulty in
arranging for the transfer of any one among the
twenty or thirty available men—the exigencies
of the service were so desperate that not
one of them all could be spared from the post he
now occupies. There was no difficulty at all,
however, in transferring Connaught —just as
there was no difficulty in transferring old
Cambridge many years ago. Wolseley, the
lory and ghastly blunderer of the Egyptian
campaign, will probably hold the next best
post when Connaught becomes a full-blown
Commander-in-Chief, and Roberts, the one
conspicuous genius of the British army, and
the only man at present known who would,
according to army opinion, be likely to hold his
own in a Continental war, is to be made
\ iceroy of India—-which is much the same as
making a man an admiral because he is a good
editor. Between old Field-Marshal Gamp and
his prospective successor, Connaught, there
are great times ahead for Britain when she gets
mixed in a big European war. The Gamp
regime has been a period of little, pettifogging
wars interspersed with murderous defeats by
Zulus, Boers, and Afghans—fifth-rate nations
whose armies won, sometimes by straight shoot-
ing at a lot of wretched British boys, but
mostly by throwing themselves headlong
against the leaden bayonets which were made
by contract in Germany—-and ruinous victories
gained with the utmost difficulty from the
tribes of the Soudan. Its successes, Such as
they were, have been mainly against tenth-rate
little States in South-Eastern Asia.
Eyeglass Reid, of New South Wales, sits on a
rail and endeavours to grab the Single-tax vot e
and the selector’s vote at the same time, A s
the Single-taxer wants to levy on the selector*
and the selector would gladly see the Single-
taxer hanged first, this is a matter requiring
much diplomacy :
He would not put a finger on these men until you came
to a level above what he called the water-line of subsist-
ence. Every man’s income and means should be free
from taxation until the ordinary wants of life were
satisfied.
It will be noted that the man with the shiny
eye doesn’t attempt to define where the “ water-
line of subsistence” comes -in. It may not be
reached till the selector is inch enough to buy
a grand piano, or it may be reached as
soon as he can afford bread to eat with
his native - bear or ’possum. Therefore,
Mr. Reid, if he gets into office, reserves the
right to levy a Land-tax on everybody, on the
assumption that everybody is above the “ water-
line.” And, on the other hand, he also reserves
the right to abandon the tax altogether, on the
ground that so very few laud-holders are
furnished with the ordinary necessaries of life
that there is nothing left worth taxing. It all
depends on which party seems most worth con-
ciliating. Meanwhile, each party probably
thinks that the wily man with the glass eye
has declared in its favour, and the announce-
ment was received with “cheers” from both
sections of the audience.
“Joseph Palmer” (sharebroker, who, as
Baptist Union Chairman, doesn’t believe in
gambling) pours out the burden of a sympa-
thetic soul in the Sydney Telegraph on the
subject of Land-taxation :
A has a billet in the railway workshops. He works
eight hours a day and earns £3 12s. per week. He enjoys
all the advantages of city life, including the privilege of
attending political meetings at Newtown. He owns a
nice little cottage at Erskineville. The value of the land
upon which it is built is £lOO, and a tax of 2d. in the
pound upon that will cost him 16s. Bd. per annum. Bis
a blacksmith in a country town. He works not more than
eight hours a day, and his earnings are fully £6 per week.
The land on which his smithy and house are built is
worth, not reckoning improvements, £lOO, and his share
of the public burden will also be 16s. Bd. per annum. Y
is a fruitgrower at Lane Cove. He works twelve
hours a day. Taking one year with another,
allowing for droughts and glutted markets, his
income will not on the average exceed £l5O per annum.
The unimproved value of his 15 acres of orchard land is
£l5OO, and the tax will cost him £l2 10s. per annum. Z
is a farmer. He works nearly all the time on week days,
and partly on Sundays too. Every member of his family
works also. Sometimes in a bad season he earns nothing;
but say on the average he makes £250 per year; his 320
acres would in their natural slate be worth £3200, and
his quota of the tax will be £2B 13s. 4d These
four examples will show that our town friends A and B
are not quite blind to their own interest in crying out for
the tax in question.
Joseph then breaks off just when he began to
be in danger of growing interesting. The fol-
lowing is the unwritten portion of his letter :
Xis a gentleman who does no useful work. He doesn’t
produce anything or facilitate the exchange of other
people’s products, neither does he teach anything, or
encourage any art or science, or help to amuse his fellow-
men, ‘ and make their lives more cheerful. The world
would get on just as well- or better—it he were dead. lie
lias 150 acres of land somewhere near Sydney ; he {jot it
for_£s an acre, and, though he never spent anything on
it, it is now worth £lOO. He doesn’t grow anything on it
or allow anybody else to do so, because he wants £l5O an
acre, and until he gets it he will continue to be an
obstruction. Even if there were a famine in
the land he wouldn’t allow anybody to cultivate
one potato on his property unless he were first bought
off—he would see a starving community darned first.
The State makes roads and railways to enhance the value
of his land, and the city taxpayer stands most of the cost
of them. X. himself doesn’t. If a land-tax were imposed
X. would have to pay £l5O a year, and therefore he boils
over and writes to the Daily Telegraph about the woes
of the farmer. Not being a farmer himself, however, he
doesn’t care any more for that person’s troubles than he
does for the anxieties of the chimney-sweep—the only
thing he does care for is his own “ unearned increment.
Direct Legislation by the People.
The Bulletin, while at variance on some
details with the subjoined forceful pronounce-
ment, earnestly asks the Democrats of Aus-
tralia to keep it prominently before them and
let its arguments soak well in. The rule of the
people can only come about through the de-
struction of the present parliamentary system
and the substitution of the Initiative and
Referendum ;
The thinking proletariat has long since understood
that all political struggles centre—not in ideal principles,
but in material class-interests. “Ideal principles’’
are merely the cloak assumed by bourgeois (Bulletin
translation. Fat Man) parties in order that the people may
be deceived as to the class-interests hidden beneath it, so
that they may as long as possible allow themselves to be
ruled over and exploited.
The political means by which class government is up-
held, and upon which capitalist class-interests are based,
is Parliamentarism : the making of laws by representative
bodies, by a so-called Representation of the People. Even
in those countries where universal, equal, and direct
suffrage, and the ballot exist, Parliaments in no way re-
present the people according to its economic composition.
The bulk of the people possesses nothing; in Parliament,
however, it is the possessing classes that are, always and
everywhere, almost exclusively represented.
Why is this? At elections the people have to elect
Persons. These individuals, or the parties to which they
belong, before the election invariably promise to represent
only the interests of the people. The great, still
ignorant, politically-uneducated masses, are easily misled
by vague and general promises, more particularly when
they are embellished by pompous programmes, and high
sounding proclamations. These intellectually narrow
masses are easily dazzled by wealth, name and reputation
and vote accordingly, and, moreover, on antiquated,
unjust systems of voting.
Now it has long been a well-known fact to the thinking
proletariat that Law is only the written interest of the
lawmaker. Laws made by Parliaments can indeed be
nothing else but the written class-interests of the possess-
ing classes, which have the majority in these Parlia-
ments. _ It is only when the various sections of the
possessing classes disagree as to their own particular
interests, and are forced to appeal for support to the
working class, that some law is passed to satisfy the
most urgent demands of the workers. Otherwise
Parliaments pay no attention to the demands of the pro-
letariat unless threatened with a revolution or when they
believe that by giving way they can save themselves.
Parliamentarism, the means by which the possessing
classes maintain their political supremacy, and at the
same time enforce their economic class-interests, is the
reason why legislation, even in the most advanced states,
is in glaring contradiction with their economic develop-
ment. Long since the progress of technical skill and the
capitalist mode of production have made the introduction
of the eight hours day possible, nay imperative, in order
to limit the industrial reserve array ; yet Parliaments will
not even think of introducing this reform. The exploita-
tion of the people through protective duties stands in the
bitterest contradiction with the capitalist mode of pro-
duction instituted on the basis of the world market; but
Parliaments never arrive at abolishing this system of rob-
bery. Militarism and the continual readiness for war are
the most utter mockery of the cosmopolitan tendency of
the capitalist mode of production ; every one sees that
this madness must drive all European states into bank-
ruptcy, but Parliaments are everywhere the staunchest
supporters of this system since they see in standing
armies far less a protection against foreign enemies than
a bulwark against a revolution of the proletariat.
The question now is to secure some system of legisla-
tion which will allow the people itself to decide upon
questions of legislation, and to make itself legislative
propositions. In questions of persons the people will be
always easily led astray; but in questions of things, in
matters of fact, they will soon learn to understand their
own true interests and to protect them.
Direct legislation by the people is the political instru-
ment with which the working classes can achieve their
emancipation, and abolish class-government; is it the
organised dictatorship of the proletariat.
In all this two things are to be presumed.
First, that the majority of the people would better
guard their common interests than Parliaments do, as we
have just sought to demonstrate with regard to
militarism. And even if the people were to make some
blunders in the beginning, they would soon learn ; their
own mistakes would enlighten them. While the majority
of a Parliament can be bought and corrupted, this would
be impossible with a people. But soon the people would
attain to a proud consciousness that their will alone is
law, and this consciousness is of great import for their
emancipation: it would directly lead to the determination
to be free economically and socially.
Secondly, it may be assumed that the dictatorship of a
revolutionary minority in the face of a great, indifferent,
or even hostile mass, would only be very short-lived, and
could never be in a position to enforce sweeping social
changes. A revolutionary minority may certainly, at
times, be able to overturn a government founded upon
force, and thus clear the way for free development; it
can, and of course should, take the initiative in intro-
ducing new forms ; but these new organisations can only
then be carried out when the majority of the people have
been declared in their favour. Final decision by the
people is the safest basis for all social actions, and alone
can secure their being carried out.
The social-democratic working class cannot carry out
its mission of emancipation by the old methods which the
bourgeoisie employed when in its revolutionary phase.
The latter had only old barriers to tear down in order to
clear the road for unregulated capitalistic enterprise.
What stood in the way of the triumphant advance of the
capitalistic mode of production were the rotten remnants
of mediaeval guilds, and feudalism. Tiie revolutionary
bourgeoisie did not consider it their mission to build up a
new social organisation, but relied upon the free play
of industrial forces, or, in other words, on economical
anarchy which was to lead us into the best of worlds.
In the event of the collapse of bourgeois society, this
would leave behind it nothing but a State incapable of
solving economic problems, no longer able to exist, and a
society crumbling into atoms. It is the duty of the work-
ing class alone to prepare a new organisation of society.
The beginning of this economic organisation is provided
by the trades unions; the political organisation will be
prepared by direct legislation through the people.
It is self-evident that direct legislation by the people is
to be applied to all subordinate departments of the State
from the commune to the nation, from the municipality
or township to the federal State, and that therefore the
widest-reaching freedom of action must be secured to all
these subordinate departments.
Direct legislation by the people has its origin in those
times in which mankind still lived in communistic tribal
and clan (gentes) communities. Relics of this ancient
democracy, the “ Wilenagemot ” of the Old English
people, are still to be found in the “ Landsgemeinde ”
Cantons of Switzerland - where the people, up to this very
day, make their laws, and elect their government, at open-
air meetings. The first normal working day, legally fixed
on the continent, was enacted by the “Landsgemeinde,”
or the popular assembly of the Canton of Glarus.
Two elements go to make up direct legislation by the
people; the one is the suggestion, the right of proposal,
the right of the people to bring forward propositions—the
initiative; the other is the enactment, the right of
decision, the vote of the people, the referendum. The
initiative is the right assured to a certain proportion of
the people (l-20th or 5 per cent.) of proposing resolutions
or laws, which must be submitted to the vote of the whole
of the people. The Referendum is the right of the people
to vote upon eveqv law. A law is, not even provisionally,
to come into force, until it has been accepted bv i
majority of the voters.
Direct legislation by the people implies, that the exectt
live and judicial authorities, all members of administrative
bodies and legal tribunals must be elected directly and bj
a proportional vote of the people.
tor superintending the administrative work of govern-
mental and legal bodies, and for the preparing and draw
mg up of laws, representative bodies, similar to th-i
present parliaments, may be elected, but also by a direct
and proportional electoral system ; their importance, how
ei er, is to be subordinate to the Initiative and Referen-
dum. The chief power will then belong to the people,
and the social-democratic party will in the right of the
Initiative have an invaluable means of bringing theii
postulates directly before the people for consideration
and of getting them realised.
The people will then have in its hands to break down
class government, and to create better social condition!
for itself.
The Workers, considering:—
That Law is the written interest of the lawmaker;
That in the making of laws the interests of the whole oi
the people should be paramount;
That experience has shown that representative bodies
represent Capitalists rather than Workers, and that they
therefore make laws favourable to Capital and detrimen-
tal to Labour;
That wherever parliamentary government is supreme it
has led to corruption and the betrayal of the people ;
. -And that only by the direct intervention of the. people
in the making of laws will the people come to understand
its own strength, the strength necessary to free the
working class,
The Congress, therefore, declares
That, as a preliminary means towards the abolition ol
all class-rule, the working-class must support—as a power-
ful political weapon—direct legislation by the people, and
that the people shall exercise the right of proposing laws
(Initiative), and thef right of voting upon the laws proposed
(Referendum).
Everything for the people, and everything by the people !

-846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
September 6, 1893.
My Dear Moorabinda—
Lady Duff’s first hop was the usual success.
The fact of being on the vice-regal premises at all
is happiness enough in itself for the “society”
person—and I am told that not one refusal was
received by the particular “suite” who looks
after the visitors’ book. The plans and specifica-
tions of Lady Duff's blue-grey and pink dress
have been already given, and her jewels were
diamonds, of course. The Duff girls (they have
already earned a not-unflattering sobriquet among
people who know them, by the way) wore white
satin and pearls.
Two pretty sisters, not long from Melbourne,
appeared clothed albescently as debutantes,
although a night or so previously they had been
applauded performers in pea-green at a public
concert. But, when you come to think of the
mystic meaning of the colours, green is ever so
much more suitable a tint than white for a modern
maiden to clothe herself in for her first public
appearance. There were many debutantes at the
vice-regal festivity. Also, there have been very
few society - matches made lately. Female
guardians in general should take a line from the
tea-merchants, who keep the new crop very dark
until the market has cleared.
Sydney society is thin-skinned. Else why
should it be so perpetually on the look-out for
snubs from Government House? The last cause
of uneasiness is Lady Duff’s notion of being “at
home ” (by invitation) on Saturday evenings—
not because that night is more or less associated
with the pleasure-seeking of shirt-sleeved people,
but because it is de rigueur (in “stiff ” circles) to
leave off enjoying yourself at such a Cinderella-ish
time on the last day of the week, lest you should
inadvertently break an hour of the Sabbath—
even only a very Tittle one at the top of the clock.
So you see the whole trouble: “It’s as if you
weren’t wanted after supper ” —they say.
The question still being considered by a much-
embarrassed Sydney hostess is—how much defer-
ence the daughter of certain vice-regalities expects
to have paid her at an informal evening party ?
Suppose, the hostess argues, the procession to
supper is not a Noah’s-Ark business and only one
or two dowagers are given somebody to march
with, all the sprightlier spirits sorting themselvo,
ought even a vice-regal young lady to ruffle her
feathers if she is not at table when the rest are
seated, because she waited to have somebody
assigned to her? To rank her amongst the
chaperones or not to rank her—that is the ques-
tion. Meanwhile, there is understood to be some
little temporary frigidity between Government
House and this perplexed hostess, who serves as
an awful warning that a Governor’s daughter
must not be allowed to attract her own cavalier
to clear her path to the cold turkey.
Got. Duff on horseback promises to revolu
tionise Sydney equestrianism, if he sets the
fashion in pigskin as he sets it everywhere else.
His Ex. takes all uncrowded public thoroughfares
at a hand-gallop, and his morning performances in
the Centennial Park, where no slack reins are
allowed, might belong to John Gilpin. I hear
that one military man, who has been fined for
galloping, is simply dying to ask whether the
ranger has a blue pencil-mark against his Ex.
The Duff daughters, by the way, are setting a
thrifty example to the vehicle-haunting Sydney
society girl, and many a reconstructing parent
must have blessed their advent just when the
banks had burst. Walking to pay their friendly
little visits is their latest-discovered virtue. The
other day they were seen in the wilds of
North Sydney footing it briskly as if the wallaby-
track was a familiar experience.
Sydney’s own particular Major General Booihi
in his speech at the formal celebration of the re'
turn of the local troops from the perils of Picca-
dilly, made a very nioe distinction when he said
that “the exhibition of manliness and military
virtue by our representatives had shown the
British public,” etcetera.
I do hope the returned Australian bravoes —the
heroes who had the amusing front to illustrate nt
an English military tournament an attack made
by bushrangers on Australian soldiery !—exhibited
more than mere “military” virtue. The virtue
of Tommy Atkins is so proverbial that only the
most untrammelled girl will include his escort in
her Sunday out: he has just as lovely a reputation
in the country he bleeds for as has his natural
enemy, Jack Tar, in Australia. If Sydney’s
warriors can only be congratulated on their
“military” virtue, from an English standpoint)
it is time Madame Sterling talked to them.
I saw one of our returned defenders doing the
Block the other day. He had top-boots on and a
murderous tilt to his hat, also there was wax on
his moustache, and his eye glanced to and fro in
the sliding manner of a man who has learnt the
art of sizing up a whole street-full of lovely crea-
tures without missing a point. And he still
swaggered the swagger that fascinated Miss Bull
and must have made the poor, ignorant Britishers
conclude that the Australian nation, when on foot,
steers itself along the highways on the rudder
principle.
Any Australian Governor who is at all good-
natured needs to be made of money nowadays.
One reason—some people say the real reason—
why Lord Jersey left in such a hurry was that a
Distinguished Somebody had been heavily
“ obliged ” by the amiable George, and “ M.E. J.”
getting to hear of it she whisked him back ’Ome
out of the reach of I.O.U’s for more figures than
one. I wonder what sort of luck this financial
cormorant will have if he tries to pass any of his
paper on Governor Duff ?
Though State economy is necessary just now,
business should be managed differently at the
Sydney Registrar-General’s office where, so far as
the visiting public is concerned, everything
seems tangled up in one room. It can’t possibly
be pleasant for, say, a young woman coming to
register the advent of tootsy-wootsy to have to
give confidential details before sometimes a dozen
people. And persons who come to sob out official
particulars of the latest death to the spruce
youths in attendance would surely prefer to do so
without an unsympathetic crowd jogging their
elbows.
N.S.W. Art Society had a big crowd and much
carbonic acid gas in their garrett—no, gallery—
at the private view of their Spring pictures last
Saturday. There were no feminine costumes
worth mentioning, but a legal dignitary wore a
waistcoat spotted like a native cat, and one he-
artist was in a heavenly shade of grey cap-a-pie. I
sincerely hope his party didn’t lose him when the
sun set, for he was just the colour of half-past
six p.m.
I shall say nothing of the pictures until I have
a chance of viewing them deliberately, for how
can you feel the mesmeric influence of works of
art when people are treading on your toes? As
iu a dream I saw the smug visage of a chubby
infant grasping a bunch of startled pink roses,
and I thought she more deserved to be on a mug
for a Good Girl than on the line ; I came suddenly
round a dark corner on to a long-drawn-out lady
in a birthday suit who didn’t deserve to be hung
so discreetly—she wasn’t convincing enough to my
mind, and i was brought up against a mob of gee-
gees with the light and shade so evenly treated
that all their skins looked like moire silk. Hilda
Spong’s spectre, in an old-gold dress, had a lovely
frame; but the picture of somebody’s fiancee on a
plaque was an admirable likeness, naturally. Close
study of your subject generally ends in success.
The annual banquet followed right on the heels
of the private view. Governor Duff was on deck,
and told them to buy some old masters for the
gallery. With my mind's ear can I hear the
Private Secretary telling His Ex. to say that. It’s
such a safe thing, doncherknow.
“ The Mountebanks ” at Sydney Lyceum is an
opera which suits nearly every member of the co.
in point of wardrobe. Tapley may take it from
me that he looks his very prettiest as Alfredo, in
black and scarlet, and eftsoons as the bogus Duke,
Ryley makes a beautiful brigand, in a pair of
pants striped like tobacco-wrappings, and a trans-
pontine hat, and Howard Vernon’s mountebank,
in similar knickerbockers, is a bright red spot in
the scenery. All the girls have Italian dressing,
and their quaint Roman aprons, embroidered
in gold and coloured threads, may tend to a
revival of them in society, where they figured not
so long ago at afternoon-teas.
Flora Graupner in dark-blue satin, cream bro-
cade and gold spangles, went about on her heels as
if the floor was wet in the first part of the opera,
but I never saw her look so pretty as she did in
the white rube of the clock-work Ophelia and a
golden wig; May Pollard had a Mounted In-
fantry sort of hat in the first act that became her
to a hair; Violet Varley, in white satin picked
out with coral, looked very pretty, and in her first
pretence at an old woman she remined me of
“ Playing at Grandmother,” but her usual meta-
morphosis was most artistically old-cronlish and
was a very triumph of make-up. But Ida Osborne,
as Ultrioe, was the most convincing Italian of
them all. Altogether, “The Mountebanks” is
one of the most becoming operas I ever saw.
On (lit that at what was intended to be a very
high-toned banquet in Sydney the other night the
guests drank water —they couldn’t swallow the
vintage provided. And the age of miracles is past,
unfortunately !
I was rather interested in a diatribe against
“ heavy dark clothes, tight black boots, and a
billy-cock which broke out in a Sydney daily
recently, because, from a society point of view, wo
really haven’t enough billy cock in the country.
I notice it most at the races where the percentage
is one top-hat to six-dozen hard-hitters, even on
the jaunty “ going-to-the-Derby-in-a-four-in
hand ” sort of man, and the heavy-dark-clothed
person is like a needle in a bundle of hay
—the men in free-and-easy sac morning suits being
the hay.
Woman must indeed be kicking over the con-
ventional traces if ad vts. show which way the wind
blows. I lately saw a calm and collected notice in
a Sydney paper boldly setting forth that a doctor
wanted an assistant, “ lady or gentleman ’’—any
odds on the lady !—to travel round the shearing-
sheds ! It strikes me that the emancipated woman
is going to be very confiding indeed if she
encourages this sort of thing, and starts out
boldly in a cut-under buggy with an itinerant
sawbones to whom she hasn’t even been intro-
duced, to exploit the unprotected shearer who has
been bitten by a sheep. Utopian prospect! Even
the dubious viewers of matrimony are much more
bashful than that.
All the talk about the higher education of
women in Australia is putting the cart before the
horse, for at least half our “ society ” women spell
on the phonetic principle, without the help of a
dictionary, and general culture isn’t very much
beyond the pot-hook stage. I am thinking now
of a civic potentate’s wife—a very well-known per-
son, indeed —who was not always in social
evidence, and who didn’t even know how to write
before her espousal to the future magnate took
place. But the marriage ceremony necessitated at
least one signature, so she practised her new name
—“ Mary Jane Smith,” call it—for three months,
and when she had g< t it to look more like a name
and less like an accident with the ink-bottle, the
exact date of the ceremony was fixed.
But then somebody discovered that she had to
sign her virginal appellation, too, and so the
happy day was further postponed for six weeks,
while the bride-elect breathed heavily with her
tongue out as she climbed the up-strokes of her
maiden name and nearly blotted herself out of
recognition with ink.
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Walter Bentley, armed with a robust
Scotch accent, opened at Sydney Criterion on
Saturday night as Cardinal M‘Richelieu from
Aberdeen, and received much applause as that
altogether unexpected statesman of the misty
past. The character might have been made a
trifle more complete if it had been played in kilts,
but otherwise it was all en suite. Bentley’s
Cardinal is a deep dissimulator, who always clears
his throat long and violently in moments of pro-
found thought, and be hasn’t an “o” in his com-
position, consequently he says that he will hide
himself in the skin of the “fax,” which animal
is a hitherto unknown circumstance among the
realms of zoology. Also, he is gifted with a capa-
city for occasionally missing important points,
and one or two of his most thrilling speeches are
delivered very much as if he were asking someone
to pass the haggis—only the haggis doesn’t come.
Even the Curse of the Church drops somewhat
flat. At other times he rises successfully to
a great occasion, but, unluckily, he always
rises in Scotch, and when he falls he falls in
the same language. Several others members of
the company are a tolerably continuous fall.
Lachlan M‘Gowen, in the character of Father
Joseph, bears the aspect of one recently
washed with yellow soap, but otherwise ho
has no striking characteristics. Mr. Albert
Lucas is generally acceptable as Baradas,
and Messrs. Stoneham and Greenaway and
a quantity of good scenery are redeeming
features. Still it was a relief, on Saturday night,
when the Cardinal bounded in broad Scotch on
the fragments of the treasonable despatch at
10.45 precisely, and the ghost of the old time hero
went to shake his kilt down the dusty corridors of
time and to blow on a spectral bagpipe away back
in the buried past. There are many good points
about the ancient statesman, but the audience is
haunted to the very last moment with a fear lest
his accent should break out in a new place. After
seeing Bentley, The Bulletin will always picture
Richelieu as a person garnished with a faint odour
of whisky who skirls on the pipes in His hours of
idleness.
** * *
“Struck Oil,” a comedy which never
really fades, was revived at Sydney Majesty’s on
Saturday, with Miss Maggie Moore as Lizzie
Stofel, and John Forde as the Federal soldier from
the Fatherland. “Struck Oil” is getting to be
rather ancient and stricken in years, but even now
it is almost as reliable a draw as it was in the pre-
historic days when old John’s daughter was as
young as she looked. If a second Magerie Moore
arises in the future the comedy will pro-
bably live for another half-century. Even
now Maggie doesn’t look as if Miss Stofel had
grown very much older ; her smiling face is good
to look upon, her high spirits are infectious, and
a vast multitude worship her with all its old
ardour. Mr. H. R. Roberts fills the part of Dr,
Brown, and Sterling Whyte risks his life in the
fatal character of Deacon Skinner. He acts it so
well that it is almost worth the risk; nevertheless,
considering how many good men the part has
killed, The Bulletin feels sorry that some en-
tirely objectionable individual didn’t take it
instead. “The Chinese Question” forms the
rest of the bill, which is drawing solid business.
** * *
“ The Mountebanks,” at Sydney Lyceum
last Saturday, was more a verbal than a melodious
success. Gilbert’s muse goes but skittishly to
Oellier’s music, and a somewhat Jack-o’-Lantern
operetta, looking at it scorefully, is the result;
you seem to be promised a fine tune next time the
bat >n comes down, but when it does there is still a
cold spot in your soul.

“The Mountebanks” is an opera that
ought to inspire smart acting if the proverb about
good parts making good actors is true—which
is probably why the Opera 00. played with so
much energy, as if it was a brand-new troupe
fresh-caught from ’Ome, The familiar figure on
the stage is prone to infer that he is Teddy Blank
—you know what he can do if he likes—and then
act in a friendly, obliging sort of way, born of
over-familiarity on both sides, and a knowledge
that Teddy Blank will get a call however it goes—
but the Opera Co. earned their laurels in “The
Mountebanks ” as if they had never won a leaf in
Sydney before.

Miss Graupner’s flaxen-haired automaton is
the best bit of comedy-acting she has yet been
seen to do, and her business with Laud —also
clockworky, and looking something like Bruce
Smith in want of a barber —roused so much en-
thusiasm that it almost looks as if the enterprising
manager of the future will cordially invite appli-
cations from the waxworks when his funny man
is laid low. May Pollard’s historic nervousness
interfered with her singing of Theresa’s music,
but her singing of “I’m but a goose,” and
her share in the Dickey-bird quartette, were
pleasant experiences. Tapley rather mumbled
his vocal sentiments ; Ryley’s acting as the
brigand metamorphosed into the monk must
have cast a gloom over the d.c. damsels,
who know enough about men to understand that
the youth who is capable of being funny is rarely
capable of being truly intense ; and Vernon’s
Pietro—especially when he was poisoned—was a
spectacle for the gods, judging by the applause he
got. Violet Varley, Ida Osborne and Arthur
Lissant were undismayed as Minestra, Ultrioe
and El vino di Pasta. Leon Caron’s hand never
faltered all through the complicated score,' and
cheers greeted Gordon’s clever scenery.
** * *
Mr. J. J. Übfcing’s “White Slaves” was
exhibited to a reasonably large and surprised
audience, at Sydney Opera House on Saturday.
There are more elements of astonishment in this
drama than can be compressed into one notice. It
contains three violent deaths, and they are all
built on a plan that no other dramatist ever
thought of. One man is fatally stabbed in the
first act, and also in the chest ; and, after
lying on the stage awhile, he gets up and
writes a full statement about- how he met
his fate; then he walks round a little for
change of air and dies. The second breaks his
back by falling over a precipice, and after being
hoisted up he lies around and dies peacefully
awhile in the centre of the stage; then
he rushes out and gets a gun and shoots
the principal villain, after which he lies
down again and finishes dying. There is reason
to believe that violent excitement accelerates his
end. The shot villain, feeling himself fatally
injured, stands up and confesses his crimes in his
top hat, and then walks off to die in the wings
where his contortions won’t irritate the audience.
Mr. Utting’s law is peculiar and unlike anybody
else’s, for when a murdered man is found on the
floor, and the villain is found looking at him with
his coat-tail under his arm and his back to the fire,
suspicion doesn’t fall on the villain; but another
person is sent to penal servitude on his un-
supported assertion. This victim has a friend who
holds proofs of his innocence, but the triend some-
how won’t produce them on any account; he only
weeps and throws himself over a precipice. The
principal incidents don’t appear on the stage at
all, but are mentioned afterwards to a publican’s
widow. When the hero is fixed up for life in
Portland prison, his loving sweetheart and some
devoted friends go down to see him ; they speak
of this excursion as a kind of picnic, and say it
will be “ nice. ” The girl in a summer hat who
thinks it will be nice to see her lover breaking
stones with a convict livery on has a pleasant taste
for horrors, and would probably make up a party
to see her father hanged. A number of casual
people wander about in the waste places of this
drama, and try ineffectually to disguise their
misery, but as they never did The Bulletin any
injury, their names are hereby suppressed.

solid old melodrama, “An English
Lass,” is revived at Sydney Royal this week.
There is no visible change in Margaret Catch-
pole’s history since her last appearance in Sydney,
and the attempt to make a heroine of romance out
of that vicious and bad-tempered female is about
as impracticable as it was before. Miss Blanche
Lewis makes a decided success as the ideal Mar-
garet—not the shrill and cantankerous convict-
flogger of dull reality—and Mr. Darnpier repre-
sents an ideal sailor in a satisfactory fashion. The
real sailor of those days has never been put on the
stage, and, by reason of his absolutely unpublish-
able language, he probably never will be.

The Steens have a new programme (his
week which is a trifle more unaccountable than
the last. The mystery of the stout lady in the
chair and the thin gentleman with the ’Murkan
accent, who hovers round and asks her impossible
conundrums, is more bewildering than it was
before. Also, the gentleman has developed an
aggravating cabinet-trick, and a horrible habit of
putting cards under a hat, despite the fact that
lie doesn’t approach the hat and that a committee-
man is holding it down with both hands—not
necessarily for publication, but as an enduring
guarantee of good faith,

A few among the many friends and pupils
of that old favourite and brilliant actress, Signora
Majeroni, will hold possession of Sydney Gaiety
on the 13th and 15th of this month (next Wednes-
day and Friday), when the fine society play,
“ Jealousy,” will be produced. Signora Majeroni,
whose disappearance from the stage left a gap
which has never been adequately filled by any
other artiste, will appear as the Marchioness, and
Mario Majeroni takes his late father’s part as the
Marquis of St. Elia. The other characters will
be rendered by prominent amateurs and profes-
sionals.

“ On Change,” a light reminder of B. and
B.’s halcyon days at the Bijou, was revived at
Melbourne Princess’s on Saturday. The author
of “On Change” started off with an idea of
showing that a cantankerous scientist is naturally
incapable of buying the right stocks. The moral
is not fairly arrived at, however. Although the
savant in this instance makes a woeful ass of him-
self, he is an argument in favour of the fiction
that “tips” of priceless value may be picked up
at a second-hand bookseller’s. Professor Seneca
Peck is the erudite idiot aforesaid, and Court
neidge scored a success in the character. Barring
a nervous habit of shaking his head there was no
suggestion of the actor’s burlesque personality to
be found. The Professor had a pure Scotch
accent which took the audience by sur-
prise, and a chronic irritability that carried
conviction with it. Also, he was so
earnest in desiring to pay back the capital h*
thought he had “ hie wed ” that the Caledonian
land-boomers of Melbourne suffered severely bj

and the cast in general made things lively. “On
Change ” is noted for a certain little love-scene, in
which the palpitating pair strike lucifer matches
fitfully until the lady brings matters to a climax
by blowing out her boy’s match and falling upon
his chest in the darkness. Miss Watson and Sass
acted this scene well, as they act everything, but
the memory of Miss Gilmore and Titheradge
doing the same business will never be effaced.

On Saturday tho Italian opera and ballet
season, on which the hopes of W. & M. are fixed,
will open at Melbourne Princess’. The opera
selected for this very particular occasion is “I
Pagliacci,” a musical excitement in two acts, last-
ing about fifty minutes each. The “ blue ballet ”
divertissement, “ Tnrquoisette,” will follow, and
this is timed to hold the floor for three-quarters of
an hour or so. Joy! Prices have been fixed at six
shillings for dress circle and reserved stalls, four
shillings for stalls, and two “bob ” for the amphi-
theatre —only a small increase on ordinary rates.
An extra booking fee for first-night seats seemed
to excite a rush of applications, rather than other-
wise, so it the show be as good as they say, it
can’t miss making a big stir.

At Melb. Royal, where prices are popular
and managements evanescent, theTaylor-Carring-

with an Irish drama, set it up in a respectable
manner, and by Saturday the woes of the.colleen,
and the opportune arrival of the bhoy who bates
the lame informer, had begun to be cordially re-
ceived by fair-sized audiences. “Home Rule” is
an endurable Irish drama of its kind, in which
Charles Taylor and Ella Carrington sing a good
deal. Respectively they sing too much, but in
concert they make harmony and get a hearty
encore. Also, they have been playing most of
their dramas for several years, consequently they
heap confusion upon the “happy ” informer with
a skill that grows out of long practice in rushing
forward at the right moment.

The Wild-Cat Column.
The ghost of the dead boom was disturbed in
Vio. Legislative Council last week over a return moved for
by Levi, M.L.C., as to the number of companies floated in
that garish period of monetary insanity. The figures
showed that between Ist Jan., ’B7 and 30th June, ’93,
1163 companies were registered in Melbourne—most of
them in ’B7 and ’S3. Of these 397 are publicly and noto-
riously dead, defunct, burst and insolvent, and many of
the balance haven't been heard of for a long, long time,
having simply been fired out of theoffice for non-payment
of rent. A lot of these eo.’s consisted practically'of one
man, and that man is now missing or in the Benevolent
Asylum. There are practically no new' co.’s being floated
in Melbourne these days, save a few mining ventures, and
the man who thinks he sees a new limited-liability spec,
advertised in the papers simply concludes that he has got
them again, and is seeing prospectuses instead of snakes.

The Colonial Investment and Agency Co. —still
another of the famous Davies institutions—hopes, with
good luck, to ultimat ly pay' its creditors Is. 6d. in the £.
As far back as 1890 every title-deed the co. possessed had
been pawned to the bank as security for its overdraft, and
in addition a general lien had been given which covered
everything else, including its soul and the office
poker and the gum-brush. Yet, despite this unspeakable
state of things, the balance-sheet for ’9l declared the co.
to be a flourishing concern with a £130,000 reserve ; and
a dividend of 12J per cent, was declared. In the ordinary
sick bank the reserve can’t be found when it is
wanted ; but the reserve fund of the Colonial teas found,
and the results were about twenty times more lamentable
than if there had been no reserve at all.
• # #
The fund in question wasn’t cash ; it consisted
of 40,778 contributing shares in the busted Daviesian
mortgage and land banks and companies. There-
fore, the reserve, instead of being an asset of £130,000 as
it professed to be, is a liability and a dead loss of about
£40,000 ! It was a horrible peculiarity of the Daviesian
oo.’s that the assets of almost every one of them con-
sisted largely of shares in the other Davies co.’s—in fact,
almost every one of them was a shareholder in almost all
the others. Consequently, when one paid a large
dividend, and the shares went up with a run,
all the other co.’s which held its shares reckoned
the temporary inflation of their selling price as profit,
and declared big dividends—with deposits or bank-
money borrowed on the strength of the said
profit. Then all their shares went up in turn,
and each one of the dozen reckoned the further
rise in the shares which it held of the other 11
co.’s as more profit, and declared more dividends on the
strength of it, also out of deposits or bank overdraft, and
carried the paper balance to reserve fund, and so on ad,
infinitum. Yet none of them had any money of its own,
or anything at all except scrip and deposits. If any one
of the lot had sold out all its scrip at any time and left
the ring it would have burst up all the rest in about a
week.
* * *
Now that they have all burst each one is
making calls on the oi her eleven or so, and the other
eleven or so are making calls upon it, which
means practically that they are swapping scrip, and when
the business is finished the twelve or mure reserve funds
will make a quantity of decent pipe-lights and nothing
more. Meanwhile, the shareholders of the Colonial want
to know if the liquidators intend to exact vengeance,
and don’t seem to he getting much satisfactory informa-
tion on the subject.
* « •
The Victorian boom consisted from first to last
of about thirty-six banks or so. About, twenty four
of these hanks consisted more or less of Matthew Davies,
and the other twelve or so consisted more or less of James
Munro. Looking at it from the standpoint of to-day,
Davies and Munr.o were the whole boom from first to last,
and the man who can seize these two individuals and
put them in a cage has the boom bottled up for his own
future use and can keep it in the cellar till he wants it.
* * *
The “bluff” of Matthew Davies’letter re the
Colonial Investment Co., is characteristic. “ I joined the
board only 17 days before the close of the half-year,” he
wrote, as though he had previously been quite a stranger
to liis “tentacle.” The Argus editor jogged his memory
with a footnote—“ With regard to the above statement,
we presume that Sir Matthew Davies means that he
remned the directorate in October, 1801.” Oh !

battery continuously at work. It is an enormous body of
low-grade ore, holding fine gold, not too easy to save.

Fair wages have long been made by tributors at Hillgrove

The only joyful feature of the Sydney Real

it would have been a bigger loss had it not been sold.
Various other properties continued unsaleable and the

Several correspondents have written to
state that Jos. Pickersgill is not in Melbourne
Hospital, but is living with his brother at Men-
tone (Vic.), and that the annuity left Jos. by
Dick Goldsbrough is drawn regularly by Mr. Edwin
Pickersgill on Jos’, behalf. Poor Jos’, wealthy
friends are still willing to assist his declining
years, but he needs but little now, as he is failing
fast and lamentably.

Take a couple of Fletcher’s Pills. every second
night; they are a prompt and sure cure and give
certain relief.
FLETCHER’S PILLS are a quick, sure and
reliable remedy for all complaints arising from
torpid liver, indigestion, weak stomach, and im-
purities of the blood. They are prepared on
rational and sensible lines and do not contain a
particle of calomel, gamboge, or any drastic pur-
gative, but operate by perfectly natural means, by
stimulating the liver and increasing the flow of
bile and thus producing easy evacuations and
natural cartharses without the annoyance and
pain of griping and purging.
Beware of the many harmful substitutes on
sale in many shops. None are genuine unless
they bear the signature of F. Moore Clements on
the outside wrapper. CLEMENTS TONIC and
FLETCHER’S PILLS have become such house-
hold words that imitations are frequently offered.
We contend that this imitation is the sincerest
proof of their virtues, so see that you always get
the genuine, bearing the name and address of F.

N.S.W. Blue-book shows six employes

Thomas Gilmore, 83 years of age, enjoys
the unique distinction of being the only hard-up
old man in N.S.W., against whom the doors of
benevolent institutions are closed by order of the
political head of the State. The order forbidding
his admission exists in the handwriting of a former
Colonial Secretary.
44 Are you going on to Mt. Gambler from
Narracoorte?” asked editor Bonython of Parkes,
and the reply was in the negative. 44 That is a

the old man, severely: 44 A mistake, Mr. Bony-
thon ! According to the Advertiser the history
of my life is a record of mistakes.”
The managing director of a Southern firm,
employing over 300 hands, declares that he never
employs anyone a portion of whose name is
Washington. If the name be George Washington
he at once returns the applicant’s testimonials
without going farther into his merits. Washing-
tons, he says, have a tendency to embezzle.
That fine old gentleman, Capt. Devlin, of
Hastings (Vie.), who died the other day, aged 82,
was the son of Arthur Devlin, one of five men
banished to N.S.W. for the part they played as
ringleaders of the Irish Rebellion of ’9B. Devlin
fifs claimed to be the first Australian born of an
Australian mother. He first saw the light on the

A horrible murder was committed in
Sydney the other Sunday, when New South
Wales Chief Justice Darley (still quite alive
and in improving health) was killed by a
Sunday paper—which went on to say that
the Judge would be succeeded by G. B. Simpson.
As if Toby Barton, who was built only for a billet
in which he could sit down all the time, wouldn’t
fit the Chief Justiceship like a glove !
Joseph Geary, Melbourne journalist, is
obituarised at last; he had long been threatened
by the doctors. Intrinsically, perhaps, he was
one of the best of his profession, yet he did not
succeed. Once, he occupied the position of
organising-inspector of Victorian State schools;
but he was not born for official harness, and so
parted with his high and lucrative post. He was
the author of the immortal phrase: “If ever a
man offers you a horse cheap, ask him 4 Why V ”
Antoinette Sterling says: 44 1 don’t know
why I should have come to Melbourne to break
my heart oyer you—to lie weeping in my bed all
night and in the trains in the day-time.” The
Bulletin doesn’t know either, unless she came
for the big salary which she collected in such a
fiercely aggressive fashion, even when she had
chattered her voice to rags and couldn’t give any
value for the money. Moreover, she doesn’t weep
in her bed all night; The Bulletin has it on
good hotel authority that she snores heavily—
after she has barricaded the door, and made the
window fast, and hung a skirt over the keyhole,
under the mistaken impression that every man
who goes past wants to look through.
An indignant deputa-
tion of old ship-captains
waited recently on theMaori-
land Minister of Labour with
a large grievance. They
came away better satisfied
than they had expected.
“He isn’t so black as he’s
painted,” said one of the
party when he got outside.
“Well,” said another old
man cautiously, “ he’s black
right enough, but I’ll admit
that he’s got white port-
holes.”
Melb. Age, extolling
the “mildness ” of modern
comic art, says : “ With the
exception of a scurrilous
picture of the empty throne,
with John Brown leaning
on it, the Queen has never
been caricatured in Eng-
land.” Allowing that Y.R.
was caricatured in a picture
where she didn’t appear at
all, the Age is still talking
nonsense. Years ago Punch
represented the Sovereign as
“ A royal lady who lived in
a shoe, and had so many
children she didn’t know
what to do,” in the act of
walloping her too numerous
family. Despite that cartoon,
Queen Victoria had two
more babies.
G. J. VY. Stevenson, of the Australian
Star staff, who died in Sydney the other day,
after many years of rheumatic torture, was once
sub-editor of Adelaide Advertiser, and for six-
teen months he was S. A. Attorney-General. His
father was private secretary to the first S.A.
Governor (Hindmarsh), and, in the very early
days, was the subject of a libel-action in which
George Milner Stephen, brother of Privy Coun-
cillor Alfred, and then Acting-Governor of S.A.,
was plaintiff. The elder Stevenson was a friend
of Bulwer Lytton, and a most capable journalist,
whose love for the sensational induced him in
later years to accept the post of City Coroner.
On one occasion while Alfred Deakin tem-
porarily occupied the Chair in Committee at the
Australian Federal Convention, he sent a written
message to Chief Secretary Gordon (S.A.)byone
of the flunkeys to say that he was sitting in an
unbecoming attitude. Gordon, lolling at his ease,
looked up, saw who was presiding, and, appre-
ciating the joke, sent back the intimation that
“ the Chairman might go to hell.” Before theemis-
sary returned, the dignified N.S. W. Speaker Abbott
had resumed his place, and the scowl which came
over his features when he received the message
and glanced at Gordon quite startled the un-
witting culprit, who recognised then, for the first
time, exactly the extent of the practical joke
which Deakin had played on him.
Dear Bulletin, —In those bygone years,
when “Young and Jackson’s ” pub., Melbourne,
was “Mooney’s,” it was the vogue with regular
patrons to pay up scores every Friday night;
meanwhile the I O U’s were kept in a tumbler on
the mantelpiece of a back-parlour. Early one
morning, after ceasing work at the Argus, we
smuggled ourselves into Mooney’s as usual. The
I 0 U tumbler was well patronised. As we were
leaving, Marcus Clarke entered and hailed us
all back. Now, Mooney adored Marcus, who
presently was standing with his back to the
mantel and fascinating the landlord with a well-
told story. Clarke’s pipe would keep going out,
and so he kept turning round nonchalantly and re-
lighting it with a neatly-folded piece of paper
taken out of the IO U tumbler. Mooney was
so entranced with the narrative that he failed to
notice this destruction of his “accounts.” Every
time we laughed (for we clearly perceived the
situation) Marcus Clarke scintillated afresh, and
Mooney only thought we were convulsed at what
was also amusing him. On the following Friday
night, at settlement time, the landlord exhibited
much surprise. The week had been a hot and
thirsty one. Yet, while some of the accounts
were abnormally large, nine of them—Clarke had
lighted up nine times !—were unaccountably
small. However, these latter shared a proportion
of their savings with those who had paid up 40
drinks to the sovereign.— Wattle B,
Poor, almost friendless and forgotten,
there died lately in St. Vincent’s Hospital,
Sydney, a man who, as a miner and prospector,
opened up some of the wildest spots in Australia.
Theodore Ranft, or “German Ted,” as he was
known on the diggings in the early days, used to
be a familiar figure on all the big rushes. He was
thediscovererof CanoeCreek(M.L.), the Ten Mile,
and other goldfields, and in those times of hard-
ship and hard living there were hundreds who
believed that he could “ smell gold.” During the
mining boom of a few years ago, Ranft made
heaps of money in Sydney as mining re-
porter for some of the most wealthy citizens
—until, in an evil hour, his name became
connected with that notorious Tarangauba
affair. That forever ruined his prestige and
eventually broke the old man’s heart. Many
still believe that he lent himself to a conspiracy,
but those who knew him intimately thought
otherwise, and it now seems certain that either
the stone he tried was salted or the implements
he used for crushing were skilfully “ prepared ”
for him —as must have been the case with another
old Sydneyite, who also reported enthusiastically
upon the mine, and backed his opinion with his
money. Ranft’s book on the “Origin of Gold”
(published shortly after the Taranganba exposure),
unique in its form and representing the work of
a lifetime, fell flat and had little sale; and now
“German Ted,” sickened of the world and its
villainies, has gone to prospect another sphere
where mines are not salted.

We lately dimpped on an odd relic—
“ Memoirs of the Loyal Americans,” The book
was designed to immortalise the names of those
who remained loyal to England, throughout the
Revolution. They are ticketed off in a way sug-
gestive of “Burke’s Australian Gentry,” noble,
historic families, solid for dear old England. It
is almost time to begin here a similar work of
embalmment. A Republican orator, in Melb.,
was interrupted by the query, “ Suppose the Ger-
mans were to found a colony in West Australia? ”
“ Well, we would absorb them.” So were the
Loyal Americans absorbed* and so will the Loyal
Australians be.
Invention in labour-saving machinery h is
responded to the public demand for elegant an 1
artistic furniture, within the reach of possessors of
moderate incomes. A visit to the workshop of
Messrs. Newton & Lamb (O’Connell and Spring-
streets, Sydney) affords proof that articles as
pleasing in design, as perfect in finish, and as
durable as any that are imported, can be manu-
factured in Sydney at prices that hold their own
with the foreign goods. Among the novelties
offered are—combination secretary bookcases and
china cabinets for dining-room, library, or boudoir;
new styles in plaited-straw, pith, and rush
chairs, lounges, tables, easels, fire-screens, &c.;
summer furniture in rattan, willow, and cane ;
light and graceful hall furniture, including taking
samples of the combination hall-seat and hat-
stand. Exclusive designs in American walnut
sideboards form a speciality, and there is a com-
prehensive stock of American full-front, pedestal
writing-tables, with perfect fittings and all con-
veniences. The prices in all lines ensure values
unequalled elsewhere.

READ THE EVIDENCE.
Mr. E. Suttel, baker, Yowaka, N.S.W., who
writes on May 3rd, 1893 About twelve months
ago I had a severe attack of influenza attended
by bronchitis. I had the attendance of a medical
man, but deriving no benefit from the remedies I
received from him, and hearing so much about the
cures performed by Clements Tonic I resolved to
give it a trial. I omitted to mention above the
various symptoms from which I was suffering,
viz : —severe headache, complete loss of appetite,
and extreme want of sleep, accompanied by sore
throat, and a continual wheezing when breathing.
Before I had finished the first bottle of Clemente
Tonic all disagreeable symptoms had disappeared.
I am only too happy to say that I have never had
to use any other medicine since, and you will never
find my house without Clements Tonic.—Yours,
etc., E. Suttel, baker, Yowaka, N.S.W.

statement. —A. Francis, cordial manufacturer.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Referendum in Q. Assembly— 39 votes
to 20. It moves.
Premier Kingston has on the stocks a bill
to make the S.A. Chinese Immigration laws east*

“ The masses live by working, the clergy
by begging, and the classes by pillaging.”—Ruskin
(adapted).
New Guinea Budget shows a deficit of

vinces pay.
Twice already has the M‘llwraith Govern-
ment (Q.) scored a division by only the casting-
vote of the Speaker.
The utter “impossibility” of Duncan Gil-
lies in Vie. politics is shown by his utterances
against the Land-tax.
Godly Australia ! First of all, the Speaker
“reads prayers,” and then the Den of Thieves
proceeds to business.
Speaker Abbott avows that ho will nob
resign the chair except to take the Premiership of
“a consolidated party.”
The Q. Kanaka - catching industry is
attracting a lot of outside capital. New ships are
being fitted up almost weekly.
How is it that N.S. W. has won an inter-
provincial reputation as owning the most discour-
teous of Australian Governments ?
Eighty-eight per cent, of Queensland sheep
are the property of 212 graziers, and 870 of the
“runs ” are in the holding of banks.
Under the lash of his political creator,
MTI wraith, Speaker Cowley (Q.) humbly ruled
against his own ruling, the other day.
Parkes states that the most important
personage he met, while in Adelaide, was his
host’s (the bachelor Chief Justice’s) Pomeranian
pup.
The Vic. grabbers consider this a fitting
time to build the Kilcunda to Cape Patterson
“ private-enterprise ” line, navvies being available
at 3s. 6d. a day.
Ballarat Chinamen assert that the Devil
has been located in their camp for a whole year.
If so, then he has a very active agent in
Melbourne.
Premier Dibbs (N.S. W.) is suspected of
electioneering designs on the new electorate of
Gwydir, being nervous as to his future in the
Murrumbidgee.
Vic, Premier Patterson moves in the
Asiatic question proposes to put Hindoos,
Syrians, Afghans, &c., under the same tonnage-
restrictions as Chinese.
Dibbs has obviously weakened on his
Penrith utterance denouncing payment of mem-
bers. Too late! The war-dogs are slipped. The
cat is out of the bag.
G. H. Reid’s squeal from the public plat-
form grows more ear-torturing as his years ad-
vance, He is now 47. What will his yell be like
at the end of another decade?
Bird, M.P. (Tas.), justifies lotteries by
Scripture. “The apostles cast lots.” On this
ground, one might justify a census-taking—not to
mention less public acts of King David.
Parkes and Robertson were both rejected
by their constituents at the elections immediately
subsequent to their acceptance of K.C.M.G.
titles. Will Dibbs mar this “ coincidence ? ”
N.Q. Separation was effectually check-
mated for a season when Premier MTlwraith
dumped Cowley into the Speakership, and mad e
Philp, M.P. for Townsville, Minister for Mines.
The Bulletin doesn’t like to see Demo-
cratic members reported as saying they will con-
test such and such constituencies “against all
comers.” Such avowals mean division and defeat.
The leaders of S.A. Opposition are Dow-
ner, Solomon, Moule, Grainger, Castine, and
Howe, while the Opposition itself consists solely
of the gentlemen named and Downer’s brother,
Henry.
Windsor (N.S. W.) Gazette has it that
it was not Newcastle llrown, but Lewis Lloyd,
the Burraga copper-king, who paid into the
N.S.W. Treasury that .£lOOO untimely pouched
by Premier Dibbs.
Best, member for Fitzroy (Vic.), has
given notice of motion condemning Party Govern-
ment and declaring in favour of the election of the
Cabinet for a fixed period. Government by Con-
tradiction is steadily wearing itself out.
Mr. Frank Farneli says he will retire from
the Parliamentary contest for Ryde (N.S. W.) if a
man he believes to be better presents himself. But
is there in Australia, or on earth, or in Heaven or
Hell, a man Mr. Farneli believes to be better ?
The record ! The S.A. Budget debate)
exclusive of the Treasurer’s speech, aggregated
but five hours, and there were but three speakers.
The Opposition recognises that it is at present mere
waste of time to attempt to discredit the Kingston
Government.
Premier MTlwraith’s Japanese bamboos
are being transplanted to various parts of Queens-
land. He collected on his last visit to Japan
eleven varieties of bamboo, and is having them
propagated over the land. He wants the Japs, to
feel at home.
Rumour states that Mr, Justice Bou-
caut is ambitious to succeed Bray as Agent-
General for S.A. His pet desire once was to
obtain election to the Australian Federal Parlia-
ment, but the realisation is too remote now even
to occupy his thoughts.
Major-General Hutton, the newly-
appointed N.S.W. commandant, has realised the
necessity of toning down his Imperialistic utter-
ances. When he arrived he talked like a swagger-
ing policeman; now he only speaks like a
sympathetic bailiff.
Parkes said in Adelaide that individually
, '®P refe »’red the Sydney Convention’s Constitution
Bill to that of Canada or the U.S. because it was
as nearly akin as possible to the great British
constitution. When Parkes’ time comes he will
want to die of English cholera.
In his Federation lecture, at Adelaide,
Parkes stated that, at the Convention, Dibbs
moved that Sydney be the capital of Australia
because he knew the other N.S.W. delegates must
vote against the motion, and so he would rise in
popularity while they would dwindle.
Bosworth, M.L.C. (S.A.), the other day
moved the abolition of payment of members.
Condensed, Bosworth ascribed the rabbit-plague,
tlie falls in wool, silver, old clothes and wheat,
Parkes long hair, the loss of the Victoria, the
size of Playford’s feet and other calamities to the
due system. Just when Bosworth had warmed
up. and was^ dealing with the effect of payment on
the occupation of Jupiter, a Labour-member fog', :
U l |ave you been drawing your salary
reg lar ?” Bosworth’s voice grew husky, and the
motion was adjourned.

What it has in its box.
Samuel Tomkinson, M.L.Q.,
will not be supported by S. A. National
Ass in his candidature next year.
Symon, Q.C., the local Purves, will
probably represent Property. Tomkin-
son has been in S.A. Legislature some
18 years, and lias ever voted Tory.
The Ass drops him, in fact, because
he is too Tory.
Surely the lowest depth of Australian
journalism has been reached by the daily paper
which does the “ Hansard reporting ” for the

Where is the cry that the white man can’t do the

In Maoriland native lands are exempt
from taxation, therefore immense areas of white
capitalists’ land are now registered as belonging
to natives, who hold them in trust. Owing to the
beastly honesty of the Maori, this practice has
hitherto led to no serious results, but in time the
Maori trustee will learn the art and mystery of
bolting with the cash.
Queensland legislation grows interest-
ing. A Village Settlement Bill, an Elective
Upper House Bill, a bill to break up the lawyers’
ring, and “ a bill to provide for the establishment
of institutions and retreats for the reception and
protection of inebriates. ” Meantime, the Land
Grant Railway steal isn’t addling. No, by
Heavens!
The division on North Queensland Separa-
tion should be interesting. MTlwraith is dead
against it. If the result of a division were to
hang on the votes of Speaker Cowley and Philp,
Minister for Mines, both of whom owe their
positions largely to the movement, how would
they act? Of course, all Australia knows how the
poor creatures feel.
The Q. Assembly has agreed, without
division, to the second reading of a Bill to reduce
the next Chief Justice’s salary back to its former
level, £2500 a year. In view of ordinary proba-
bilities, the Bill is practically useless, since Chief
Justice Griffith looks a good “life” for 20 years.
But this Parliament has emphatically condemned
the corrupt Griffith Reward Act of last Parliament.
Jawbone Neild’s address to the N.S.W.
Orangemen on the subject of Home Rule, remarks
The Bulletin’s London correspondent, has been
pronounced a model of what a good Orangeman’s
speeches should be—full of bigotry, lies and
inflammatory clap-trap. It has given delight in
Ulster, and the opinion there is that, come what
may, N.S.W. is “sound.”
“The N.S.W. Freetrade and Electoral
League will die when the elections are completed,
but the Freetrade and Land Reform League will
survive.” Thus Carruthers, M-L.A., commis-
sioned by Wise and Reid to solder breaches. In
a word, the old party will be summarily killed
and cremated as soon as the last vote has been
squeezed from it at the polls.
The “Australian Party ” in the House of
Commons, being found rather too small to possess
much influence, it is proposed to include in it any
English members who have married Australian
wives ! This bright idea, in which one may trace
the gigantic intellect of Henniker Heaton, has
been much laughed at; but, after all, this is the
principle on which Henniker Heaton claims to be
an Australian.
The Local Option scheme of the teeto-
tallers is simply the Referendum on a narrow
scale and applied to the drink-traffic only. If the
teetotal party had brains enough to realise this
fact, it would have long since dropped all mention
of Local Option—an offensive term which only
serves to rouse the liquor interest to frenzied
resistance—and gone for the Referendum as an
all-round Democratic principle.
Major Hughes, <>f the Victorian Artillery,

the other day, and thereby settled all doubt as to
whether it was his own original invective which ha
discharged at Isaacs a while back, way up in the
, wilderness. The real M‘Coll is a dreary orator,
and the speech he was reported to have made in
defence of O’Loghlen’s nolle prosequi must surely
have been composed by a “ghost.” Also, it was
possibly supplied to the press without being
delivered at all.
A relic of old English Parliamentary prac-
tice is that a member who wants to raise a point
or order in Committee must speak in a sitting
position and with his hat on. Recently Premier
peddon (M.L.) wanted to raise a point of order in
haste, and couldn’t do it because he had left his
hat in the ante-room. So he seized Rolleston’s
bell-topper (four sizes too small for him) and
addressed the House with it balanced on two of
his grizzled hairs. Then Dismal William tried to
interrupt him on another point of order, but
couldn t because Seddon had his hat, and in
despair he snatched the glossy tile of John Hall,
which came down over his shoulders, and spoke
in a smothered voice from beneath it, and Parlia-
mentary etiquette was satisfied. Thus two bor-
rowed hats saved the constitution.
Extract fi’om a private letter from N.
Queensland
On plantation near here, if the Kanakas do any-
thing wrong, or quarrel with anyone about the place at
knock-off time, they are all roundtd up and stood out in
a line. Then the overseer picks out the culprit, and the
manager, a sturdy young giant of 14 or 15 stone, scruffs
him like he would a calf, and drags him into a room, built
specially for the purpose, where he thumps out of
him with his fists and feet. A Kanaka who worked there
told me that he once capsized a dray, for which he re-
ceived the usual thumping and two days’ solitary confine-
ment without food.

M.P. (Q.) thus kicks against MTlvvraith’s Stock-
tax :
Why don’t the Government keep to their own business?
What the Government have to do is to preserve law and
order, and have as little to do with other things as
possible.
Just so. Government is a mere official hired by
Property to pour lead into “strikers,” flog the
lean and hungry, and—by the way, yes—to hand
money without interest to harassed meat-com-
panies, and loan a million or two in standing
current accounts (that aren’t current practically)
to reconstructing banks.
Prohibition—which is, of course, absolutely
impossible—is now tho card of the Vie. Alliance
people, though they kicked out Axel Gustafson
tor insisting on it. Reference having been made
to the new law in South Carolina, where the
Government took over all the drink traffic, it may
be explained that the population is 700,000 black,
450,000 white ; the terrible spread of drunkenness
amid the coloured people is the reason of the law.
Nevertheless the publicans all over the TJ.S. have
taken alarm, and other States are expected to
follow suit. In Melb. the trade is so bad that it
might entertain the idea of being bought out.
Even the Carlton Brewery directors call on the
shareholders to hearken to their tale of woe, and
the ownership of many pubs, is a weariness unto
the flesh.
The plot to make Connaught Commander-
in-Chief Hpens. It dates from his very birth
(before it was positively known that he was nob
an idiot), when he was named Arthur, with a
settled idea that he should be a successor of tho
“Iron Duke,” with the Command-in-Chief.
Prince Albert left a memo, that the office should
be kept in the Royal Family. Wellington
wanted to turn it over to Albert, who had the
sense not to accept. Since then, the struggle has
been continued by the military authorities.
A commission, presided over by Hartington.
has reported against the Royal Family system of
command, and the powerful letters of Vetus, in
the Times lately, credited variously to Dilke and
Maurice, have been on the same line. Yet Queen
Victoria resolutely pushes the tiling forward,
though disappointed in regard to the Indian
Command-in-Chief, which was to be a stepping-
stone.

Gold discoveries. Very rich fields have
been opened at Southern Cross, Coolgardie, Mur-
chison, &<■., in West Australia, which will be one
of the greatest gold-producing countries of the
world. Land in Perth and Albany, the principal
cities, is ridiculously low in price, and must cer-
tainly increase very much in value in the next
few years. One of the best investments at present
time is to secure a few lots. The Intercolonial
Investment Co., Ltd., JWJ Pitt-street, Sydney,
offers exceptionally well-|K)sitioned blocks from
.£lO each on very easy terms, or for cash,
guaranteed title. The company has been estab-
lished in Sydney and Perth for many years, and
is well known throughout the colonies for straight
dealing. The manager is Mr. W. J. Douglas,
who will be pleased to forward plans to any
address, and, having a personal knowledge of the
properties, will select faithfully for intending
purchasers where required.

Lady Duff is already beginning to under-
stand the ennui of Lady Jersey, the “ blue-stock-
ing,” with the dull boredom of Sydney tabbies;
an ennui that sometimes became surcharged with
electricity and gave out sparks. As, for instance,
when a pearl-powdered dumpling beldame who
was a particular abomination in Miladi Jersey’s
nostrils ventured to remark to her hostess
at a “ Guvmentouse mixed evening ” on the
extreme lowness of the dresses worn by several
present. “Oh,” wearily yawned Lady Jersey,
“ that doesn’t annoy me. I don’t mind how un-
dressed they come—they may come nude if they
like, so long as they’re intelligent.”

The returned Australian swashbucklers
growl terribly of alleged unfair umpiring at their
contests in England. One competitor engaged in
wrestling-on-horseback dragged off his opponent,

teeth, so firmly had they linked him to the dear
old Mother Country.

Dear Bulletin, —Your are right. In the
medical profession accident has much to do with
success. Accident and money—your own or your
wife’s. Nearly all the present prominent men
owe their position either to wealthy and influential
connections, or to having judiciously acquired
them by marriage. They may have great ability,
but it is not that ability that has given them their
positions. Failing money or connections, the
only road to success is to hang on to a church.
Apart from this, nothing has so handicapped the
profession in Australia as the existence of the
universal secret friendly society, supposed to exist
chiefly for the benefit of the poorer working man,
but everywhere mainly composed of bank-officials,
storekeepers, and fairly well-to-do people gene-
rally, who are not ashamed to take all their
medical attendance at almost starvation rates,
but also ape their masters, the big capitalists,
by cutting down those rates whenever pos-
sible. At Bombala, N.S.W., the local friendly
society pays 4£d. per week for medical attendance
on the whole family, and is now calling for ten-
ders, as it considers that rate too high. They
may succeed in their object, for no profession
contains so many “blacklegs” as the medical.
There is a lot in the matter not generally known
as to the way in which country hospital appoint-
ments are manipulated so as to secure medical
attendance on the members of local friendly
societies at nominal rates.— George Dant.

ager demanded a pre-
mium of .£lO from an

The loyal Adelaide
City Council has re-
cently planted a cul-de-
sac and christened it
“ Kintore Avenue.” Ap-
propriately enough, the
only building fronting it
is the Destitute Asylum.
When the Curaqoa lately visited Vella
Lavella, Solomon Group, on annexation
business, the officers found “a ghastly
trophy of tribal warfare, consisting of 200
human skulls.” Which so shocked them that
all the heads were “confiscated, and taken
aboard.” What becomes of these skulls? In the
old days, an enormous business in Maori heads
was done by ships trading out of Sydney, and for
the past 20 years many white traders in the Solo-
mons, New Britain, and New Ireland have been
buying skulls—the fresher they are the better the
price given. The “ best ”of these relics bring in
Australia, say, 80s. each. In Europe as much as
<£2 or <£3 is obtained—from anthropological and
medical societies.
In the skull (as in every other) business there is
a middleman—the trading captain—who gets all
the profit. The poor and industrious local trader
pays, say, trade-goods to the value of a dollar,
and he sells to the skipper for 100 to 200 per cent,
profit. The 200 skulls in question are, therefore,
as, no doubt, the Curagoa officers well knew, valu-
able marketable property (the naval heroes might
just as well haveannexedalotofoil,orblack women,
or pigs), and the most rigid upholder of the con-
version of the heathen cannot possibly support so
high-handed an outrage upon the Sacred Rights of
Property. These 200 skulls must have represented
years of toil and patience on the part of their
(living) owners, and if the Curagoa officers do the
square thing, they will, after realising, “go
whacks ” with the native owners, even if the poor
and industrious trader be left out in the cold.

Among Australian girl-suicides there has
of late been a rush upon match-heads dissolved in
water. It is an exceedingly painful form of
death, but the average woman is woefully ignorant
of chemistry, and her choice practically lies
between match-heads and Rough on Rats —in
either case she might as well sear her stomach
with a red-hot iron. Formerly, most female
suicides either drowned or hanged themselves, bub
drowning means that the police will come later on
and fish for a muddy, sodden, shapeless thing
with prawns in its hair, and hanging involves the
after-entting-down of an object with a blue head
and a general dead-fish expression, and both these
modes have gone out of fashion, except among old
or desperate women who have partly outlived
their vanity.
The girl-suicide wants to be found dead in her
little white bed, with her hands clasped on her
bosom, and a placid smile on her face, and a
flower somewhere about. It is in an ineffective
effort to arrive at this result that she consumes a
lot of match-heads, and dies in the most horrible
agony. The Bulletin strongly cautions all
intending suicides against strychnia, phosphorus,
arsenic, oxalic and carbolic acids, and will
forward a recipe for painless self-effacement for
two stamps. N.B.—When contemplating suicide
always sit down and write to a newspaper for
advice. It will arrive in the form of the police.

A Melbourne dentist has been served with
a criminal summons on a charge of unlawfully
kissing a lady who went to his tooth-shop to have
two teeth stopped. Considering how a lady looks
when she has her mouth wide open exhibiting two
decayed teeth, it seems surprising that any den-
tist should ever want to kiss her.
Woman may be lovely enough, but to the man
who always sees her with her jaws spread apart
to the uttermost, and who is always looking into
her mouth for hollow molars, where is her loveli-
ness ? It is all as prosaic as looking at a quantity
of meat in an open carpet-bag. In the present
case, too, the lady was a policeman’s wife (police-
men’s wives seem peculiarly addicted to bringing

Dear Bulletin, —Not only is it true that
Speaker Abbott (N.S.W.) wants Parramatta Park
to be leased to King’s School; but the council of
King’s School (and Speaker Joe is a member of
that Council) lias actually applied to purchase 22
acres of the same park. Also, the park trustees
are “on” to sell, and believe they possess the
power to do so, the excuse being that the area is
90 acres in excess of the 200 set apart by statute
36 years ago.—Yours, J.R.

side of the Woonoona, the passengers and crew
threatened to leave the ship if he were taken
aboard, and so he was appropriately left in Cairns

Mrs. Antoinette Sterling has been deliver-

The opening shriek of Mrs. Sterling’s ora-
tion at Melbourne Theatre Royal
Men and women,— There have been, I hear, some people
trying to pack this meeting, but God is omnipotent.
This meeting is of God. 1 heard some of my sisters saying
we would have no chairman. They forgot God, who could
raise up a thousand chairmen it they were needed. I
hope there are no men or boys here who do not know the
seriousness of the subject we have met to discuss, and if
there are, I hope they will be taken out if they will not
leave of their own accord. (Applause.) I know that there
are some people who have come here on purpose to
destroy this meeting, but God is greater than anything,
and this meeting is Ills, so we are as safe as possible.
Then followed the usual two columns about the
“age of consent.” Under these circumstances it
isn’t surprising that the old Royal was crowded to
the door by the filthy saints, and that a lot more
saints were left out in the street, and that Mrs.
Sterling, when she wasn’t talking about the “ ago

in the press, on drink being the chief cause of
divorce, almost prompts one to begin proving that
PROVERBIAL PHILOSOPHY.
SYMPATHETIC BACHELOR : “I guess you must miss your poor wife, Jim.
Wouldn’t you like to have her back again, old man?”
WIDOWER : “It’s this way: sometimes I wish Pollie wasn't dead, and
sometimes I don’t. We used to quarrel a good deal.”
S.B.: “You always made it up again, Bill.”
W.: “Yes, that’s true (a pause), but we never made it up really proper
till the doctor told me she was a-goin’.”
lemonade must be the chief cause of the attractive
Knapp’s own celibacy.

It were unfair to smile, or rage
At one professing middle-age,
Or drop those hints which don’t assuage
The Purity Societies.
1 don’t agree with those, I’m glad
To say, who, since the paper’s “ bad,”
Would damn its patrons, which were sad
(But nathless worldly) wisdom.
But " Faithful's” line seems straight enough,
And “ view above ” is up to snuff,
And not by any means too rough
For self-respecting papers.
It seems a testimonial
That he is “ Matrimonial,”
And surely, surely, only all
Improper persons doubt it.
For no one ever dreamt as yet,
That “view above ” was meant to net
The injudicious little pet
With fluffy hair and morals.
For when you come to think, what could
This “ view above ” mean, but what would
As popularly understood
Refer to “Matrimonial?”
But men who form the husks and rind
Of Life-the men of evil mind—
Will ponder in a puzzled kind
Of way upon “ etcetera.”

Harper was the first bishop of the province, a
sturdy prelate of tire old sort, dealing in a
practical way with every difficulty. Before the
hill between the port and the city was tunnelled
there were many proposals to make a mountain
road. Engineers said it was impracticable, but
to their confusion the bishop put a bag of flour
in a go cart and with his two sons dragged it
across the hill. Later on the sons went into law
and land, and figure now as principals in the most
magnificent (and nasty) bankruptcy Maoriland
has ever known.

The appointment of Dr. Delany, of
Ballarat, as coadjutor to the R.C. Archbishop
of Hobart, is embarrassing, financially. The
hospitable archbishop’s fixed annual income
is only ,£OOO, being portion of interest on the
State-aid-commutation grant; he gets besides
about £2OO from marriage-licences. lie could
thus ill afford to share bis salary with bis co-
adjutor. It is generally believed that a way out
of the difficulty will be found by calling on Dean
Woods, the present parish priest of St. Joseph’s,
who has been an invalid for many years, to resign
his parish.

A witness in Melb. Divorce Court defined
“mugging” as “putting his arms round her

One reason why Chinese laundries are
rapidly monopolising the Melb. trade is that the
Chows allow servant-girls liberal commission on
all work given. A penny a shirt is a common
allowance. In a big boarding-house this amounts
to something per week.

The small jokes of the Speight v. Syme
case seem to get smaller as time rolls along. On
the 49th day they were talking about buildings
erected at Government expense, when counsel
Duffy—noted poet and wag— log.: “ My friend,
Mr. Deakin, says that when the Government put
up a building for me it will be of stone.” (Great
laughter.) A profound joke to retail on the 49th
day of a trial. One hopes that David Syme, who
stands the expense of a special jury, apart from all
other expenses, was struck by Deakin’s humour.

A juror in the eternal Speight v. Syme

As both Rosebery and Queensberry have
visited Australia, we are interested in the threat
of the Marquis (evidently as mad as the rest of
his family) to punch Rosebery for having ap-
pointed his (Queensberry’s) son Drumlanrig to the
House of Lords over the head of his father. The
youthful Drumlanrig, according to the press,
receives the peerage for bis valuable diplomatic
services to the State; whereas it was really given
him as Rosebery’s political lackey, to enable him
to fetch-and-oarry for his master when the latter is
amongst the British peers.

A Sydney fire-brigade official: —“They

it takes to convict a man of arson. It is necessary
almost to see a place set alight before you can
secure a committal; while, on the other hand,
circumstantial evidence will put a rope round
many a neck.”

Gov. Kintore, in lately opening an
Adelaide charitable fair, “hoped that visitors
would come with full and leave with empty
pockets.” Then he perambulated the show with
the Chief Justice and suite, chatted with stall-
holders, and complimented them on their taste,
but spent nothing. A big St Bernard dog, with a
cash-box hung on its neck, was collecting, and
its owner introduced it to the representative of
Majesty with, “You can’t refuse Leo, your
Excellency.” “One can’t give to everything,”
remarked the canny Kintore, but later there was
relenting, and Toby got from a vice-regal flunkey
—a penny. iEsop was right. “Trumpeters don't
fight.”
Adelaide Advertiser, reporting a divorce-
ease, states that petitioner and respondent were
both married on the same day. Very likely.
When two men are going to fight a duel they
should be an equal distance apart, and one of
them should never be allowed to stand nearer to
the other than the other is to him.

Archdeacon Giinther in his early-church
sermon at Parramatta, a week ago, is reported to
have considered it incomprehensible that in St.
John’s cemetery there is no stone or monument
to commemorate the Rev. Mr. Johnson, the first
N.S.W, Anglican pastor ? Does the Archdeacon
forget that Mr. Johnson left the Church of
England, became a Moravian Methodist, directed
his energies to fruit-growing and made so much
cash out of his orchard at Kissing Point that he
was able to return to England in affluence ?

The memoirs of the late Captain Devlin

Messrs. M‘Burney, Wallis and Co., who
some few months ago started business at Mao-
quarie-street, Circular Quay, Sydney, as wool-
brokers, sheepskin, hides and tallow salesmen,
have just completed extensive alterations to their
wool warehouses situated in Margaret-street,
which will enable them to do ample justice to
their clients during the approaching wool season.
Modern appliances of a most complete and expe-
ditious character for the receiving and delivery of
wool have been fitted up. In addition to hydraulic
lifts and whips, self-acting shoots have been
adopted which are calculated to despatch at the
astonishing rate of 25 bales per shoot every five
minutes. In the show-room every care has been
taken to secure a free transmission of light
so as to facilitate satisfactory inspection of the
samples. This young and enterprising firm con-
duct their business on the legitimate principle of
broking, selling on commission only, but in ad-
dition to this they are prepared to make liberal
cash advances on wool clips and other station pro-
duce entrusted to their charge. Their sale days
have been regulated as follows : —Eor sheepskins,
every Tuesday and Friday ; hides and tallow on
Fridays; marsupial skins on Wednesday, and
during the season woo! every Wednesday only. A
complete report of their weekly sales will
appear every Saturday in The Bulletin. The
three gentlemen constituting the firm are
well and favourably known in the wool-
trading community. They are Mr. N. Mcßurney,
who for over twenty years was auctioneer
to the old firm of Mort and Co. and the amalga-
mated firms of Goldsborough, Mort and Co., Ltd.,
and Mr. E. S. Wallis and Mr. A. Henson who for
about 15 years held various responsible positions
in the counting-house of the same firms. Mr,
M‘Burney has just returned from an extended trip
through the wool-growing districts of the province,
and speaks in glowing terms of the coming clip
and his firm’s prospects; and if liberal promises
on the one hand and youthful ardour, vigour and
determination on the other are to be taken as any
guarantee of success, then this spirited young trio
have every reason to anticipate a prosperous
career.
ALL HAIL—SWEET FAITH!
Sweet Faith was once personified
In monkish missals’ pictured pages.
By fragile female forms that clung
Despairing to the Rock of Ages.
But, now’, methinks the truest type
Of trusting souls that still adore her
Weie bald-head fool who planketh down
His cash for patent hair-restorer.
Yet still, as erst, her power divine
Descends as soft as dews of Hermon ;
It sells the bolus and the pill
And sanctifies the Sunday sermon.
Election Memories.
The matter-of-fact routine of elections nowadays,
in this colony at least, are seldom relieved by the
cutting sarcasm or irrepressible wit that used to
distinguish the election speeches of such men as
Aspinall and Ireland, both eminent Q.C.’s of the
Victorian Bar. Once, when addressing a meeting
where he met with much “ barracking ” and noisy
interruption, Ireland exclaimed : “ What can I
expect from scoundrels, one-half of whom, as
criminals, I have prosecuted, the other half de-
fended.” Could that be beaten for scathing,
relentless scorn and derisive contempt ? As in
law and politics, so in medicine there are remedies
which are above all competitors. One of these,
and the most widely-known, is “ Marshall’s Tonic
Nervine,” for since the introduction of this un-
rivalled preparation, disorders of fhe nervous
system, and the acute agony of neuralgia and
toothache have been reduced to a minimum. Mr.
Ernest Ransome, of Bathurst, says: “ I have been
freed from my agonising complaint (neuralgia),
and I want everyone to know it.” Mr, Edward
Robson, of Bourke, writes: “My complete restora-
tion to health I owe to your sovereign remedy.
Let all the woi’ld know.” And this is why
“ Marshall’s Tonic Nervine ” is without a rival in
the field of remedial nerve agencies,

CLIMATIC CHANGES.
The sudden changes of temperature, so charac-
teristic of the season, are the cause_ of mure in-
dividual and domestic trouble than is generally
supposed. Most of the evils which result from
these changes originate in the little-thought-of
“chill” with which we are all so familiar. The
only really effective remedy, and one which should
be kept at all times, and under all conditions,
handy for all members of the household, is the
standard favorite, St. Jacobs Oil. It can be
bought from any chemist or druggist, and carries
with it a sense of security to the possessor shared
by no other remedy. It is
JUST WHAT IS WANTED,
for, whenever any article has stood tire crucial
test of public use and opinion for any lengthened
period of time, and the public demand for such is
continuously sustained, you may be sure that it
fills a public need. When, in the case of that
article being a proprietary medicine, the demand
is not only steadily sustained but continually
increasing, you may be absolutely certain that
there is some extraordinary merit in it, and in the
case of St. Jacobs Oil this is borne out by the
testimony of the press and of thousands of
reputable citizens in all parts of the civilised
world. Apropos, Messrs. Francis, Newbery, &
Sons, London, one -of the oldest drug houses in
Great Britain (established nearly a century and a
half), write—“We have sold St. Jacobs Oil for
years; demand continually increasing on its
extraordinary merits.”
THE DAY HAS PAST for “ poking borak ”
at the faithful, old long-winding series of
the WATERBURY Watch, Old-time Con-
servatism has gracefully acknowledged its past
errors, and now admits the WATERBURY to be
undoubtedly the VERY BEST LOW-COST
TIMEKEEPER ever offered to the public. The
ink of good-natured satire, as applied to the
Waterbury, has run dry, but the pen of interested
malice will run till the crack of doom. The new
short-winding WATERBURY WATCHES are
perfect models of horological skill; while the old
series Waterbury—paper dial and two minutes to
wind to boot—is a more reliable timekeeper than
any of its would-be rivals, in spite of the visibly-
hard - polished - nickel - plated - extra - polished-
cylinder intestines with which some of them may
or may not be fitted to special order.

It is a lighter, clearer, and more ethereal oil than any
I have hitherto used, besides being free from the heavy

This is particularly noticeable when the oil is sprayed

It is very palatable when taken internally, whicli places

TRADES HALL, DIXON-STREET,
(Foot of Goul burn -street).
N.S.W. Art Society’s Annual Exhibition.
In this year’s N.S.W. Art Society Exhibition
several of the better-known artists more or less
maintain their reputation, and some of the younger
men give unmistakeable signs of fulfilling their
early promise. The Hanging Committee, having
shown more discretion and leas favouritism than
formerly, the proportion ofabsoluterubbish hung is
comparatively small, while there is a commendable
absence of those decorated plaques and disfigured
mirrors over which ladies are wont to spend their
leisure. Fewer subject-pictures are shown than
last year, despite the example then set by Frank
Mahoney in his attempt (“Days of Old”) to
illustrate phases of life distinctly Australian.
That artist himself has been content with sending
a few portraits of horses and a pastel study of a
lion’s head —all excellent in their way but carrying
with them little interest.
# # #
In oils, the successes of the show are, from an
artist’s view-point, Arthur Streeton and Albert
Hanson, though it must be admitted that the
public eye dwells long and lovingly on the
veteran Piguenit’s largest picture. Mr. Stree-
ton’s “Fire’s On” (239) is, technically, the
picture of the year, and has been bought
for N.S.W. National Gallery. The scene
is at the Lapstone tunnel, and after a blast-
warning the workmen are hurrying out
of harm’s way. In this the painting of the
rocks and the rendering of the intensely blue sky,
which seems to palpitate with the heat, call for
high praise. This is “ impressionist ” work of the
best kind, for although the details are only indi-
cated by what anpear to be mere splashes of
colour, when viewed from the proper distance, it
will be seen that everything has been carefully
studied and the value of the tones gauged with
consummate skill. Small as are the figures on the
hillside, they by no means lack movement and
variety.
• • *
Mr. Streeton has scored another success with his
large and more prosaic canvas of “ Circular Quay ’
(301), emphatically an artist’s picture. He has pre-
viously given proof of his fine sense of colour, but
never before has he shown such excellent draughts-
manship. The time chosen is noon on a brilliant
summer day, when Quay and water are full
of life. The distance is veiled in that light mist
which accompanies intense heat in Australia, and
this has enabled the painter to tone down the
somewhat commonplace buildings in the locality,
without much affecting the verisimilitude of the
panorama. Streeton’s only figure - subject this
year is an allegorical representation of Twilight
(159) —a nude female figure floating through the
air, with a veil behind her through which the
moon is seen. The idea is origi nal, and there is some
admirable drawing in the limbs, but the picture is
utterly spoilt by the feeble doll-like head, with
its staring blue eyes and unnaturally red lips,
altogether out of tone with, the general scheme.
Apart from a clever sketch of Sydney Railway
Station (162) on a wet day, the artist’s other oil-
contributions consist of some daintily-painted
panels.
# • *
How marvellously Albert Hanson has improved
since he began his European studies ! His method
is a complete antithesis to Streeton's, and he
appears to systematically adopt a sombre tone.
Of his two oil-paintings, the better is that entitled
“Nature in Silence bade the World Repose”
(234), a truly poetical picture representing an
English river by-wash, in twilight, with the
white moon glimmering through the mist.
The period is late Autumn, when the leaves
have fallen, and the riverside reeds have
browned with the decaying year. The broad
and effective treatment of the branches
evinces a careful and loving study of Nature.
The artist who can depict the shadows thrown on
the stream as Mr. Hanson has here done has little
to learn of mere technique, and the future career
abroad of this young Sydney painter will be
watched with interest. “We say abroad,” for
the Australian painter who can seize European
fame never comes back. And why, alas, should he?
“ The Mirthful Day of the Mighty Sea ” (163), is
the somewhat clumsy title of a work the subject
whereof is much simpler than that of the paint-
ing last noticed. It is a coast view of a
stretch of grey rocks, under a dull sky, the intense
solitude of the scene being emphasised by the
presence of a flock of sea-birds on the sand.
This is also an admirable piece of work, the values
of the tones being excellently preserved through-
out.
• • *
Although Mr. Lister has not this year sent in
any canvas comparable in size to his “ Ever Rest-
less Sea,” bis contributions show no falling off
either in variety or resource. His largest picture
is a view of the little township of Blandford, near
Murrurundi (213), a broad expanse of land over
Wiich the shadows cast by heavy clouds are pass-
ing, the middle distance being occupied by some
straggling houses, backed by dark purple hills.
Unless it be that the sky is somewhat too
“painty,” no fault can be found with the work.
“Allot Day in the Fields” (175) undoubtedly
justifies its title—for the very air seems quiver-
ing with heat, and the same may be said of
the view of Curl Curl Head, near Manly (226),
wherein rocks and sea are also excellently de-
picted. Another fine study of rock painting is in
“The Track of Ages” (152), where the warm
shadows are well contrasted with the steely-grey
of the boulders in full sunlight.
# # #
Tom Roberts’ most ambitious effort is No. 1761,
painted in style new to his brush, and represent-
ing the breaking away of a flock of sheep on
coming in sight of water in a droughty land. The
man on horseback trying to head back the animals
which rush down the dusty road is clearly painted,
and there isno wantof variety in thesheep. Thesky,
however, seems too flat and to lack the luminous-
ness so noticeable in Streelon’s and Lister’s work.
The full-length portrait of Miss Hilda Spong,
“Practising a Minuet ” (274) is graceful in pose,
but more successful as a well-worked-out scheme
of colour than as a likeness, while the study of
“ An Eastern Princess ” is not favourably placed.
The best portrait by Mr. Roberts is that of Judge
Dowling.
* * *
Mr. A. H. Fullwood sends two oil-paintings this
year. The principal of these, “Tasmanian Hop-
pickers ” (254), seems hardly up to his standard,
the handling being somewhat ragged. The smaller
pictures, “At the Ferry ” (147), two figures look-
ing across a stream, is much better, the feeling of
distance being well conveyed.
.# # #
Mr. Arthur Collingridge is a voluminous con-
tributor, but his work is most unequal in quality.
He has, for instance, seldom or ever done any-
thing better than his “ Winter’s Day, Sunny New
South Wales ” (215), which is full of breeziness.
His larger effort, however, a view of the Walker
Hospital (266) is uninteresting in subject and
rather crude in treatment. Mr. A. J. Fisher’s
“Looking out for Water on the Pyramid ” (206)
and representing a girl with two pails attached to
a yoke walking down the boulder-strewn bed of a
stream, shows a distinct advance. Thera is some
excellent drawing in the figure, and the grey
stones arc carefully painted, while great attention
has been paid to the values of the distance.
# * #
Percy Spence set himself a big task in deciding
to attack such a subject as “Mustering” (227),
and though he cannot be said to have altogether
succeeded, he has produced a picture possessing
some admirable qualities. There is, for instance,
force and vigour in the black horse in the imme-
diate foreground, and the grouping is good
throughout, but the animals look too well
groomed, and the handling is somewhat thin and
hard. Mr. Spence’s “Going Out ’ (302) iscommon-
place, and “ Anthea ” (368) is a clever piece of
brush work expended on an artistically-ungrateful
subject. Mr. W. C. Piguenuit’s “On the Break
o’ Day Plains, Tasmania —After the Storm
(247) is conventionally treated, the best portion
being the bright sky with the heavy clouds passing
away behind the distant hills on the horizon.
Among the younger exhibitors who show that they
will make their mark in the world before long, are
A. R. Coffey, whose “Bend of the River” ex-
hibits decided strength and appreciation of the
beauties of nature, S. Long, J. Peddle and D. G.
Reid.
• # #
The lady-members muster in force, but their
work, with few exceptions, is mediocre. Among
these exceptions must be classed Miss Alice
Muskett, wtiose study of still life under the title
of “Pot Luck” (246), is strong, the fish being
especially well painted. Miss Lily Carter’s view
of “Bronte, Waverley ” (166), exhibits a breadth
of effect, and an appreciation of the subtleties of
form that are seldom found in a woman’s work.
Miss Ethel Stephens’portrait of her mother (218)
is not without merit, but Miss Ada Bell is dirty
in her flesh-tiftts in the life-study of a girl’s head,
while her still-life work is not above the average.
The interest in the water-colours this year is
discounted by the fact that the chief works of
Fullwood, Minns, Lister, and Miss Stephens have
already been exhibited in public, having taken
part in the National Gallery competition. This
portion of the show is indeed only raised above
mediocrity by the presence of a charming series of
English sketches sent out by Albert Hanson.
Of these the most successful is a dainty sketch of
a cottage-farm, Surrey (85), in which the red brick
house and the flower-garden, with geese in the fore-
ground. aretreated with extreme skill and delicacy.
In this section are to be seen Frank Mahoney’s
portrait of a bird in Sydney Zoo, worked in pastel,
admirable in its way, and C. H. Hunt’s drawing
in the same medium of a recumbent girl shelter-
ing beneath a Japanese parasol is one of the best
things that artist has done. C. E. S. Tindell
deserves praise for his studies of shipping, and
Miss Jessie Scarvell shows talent in her rendering
of similar scenes ; but for the rest the collection is
not striking, while of the two contributions of the
President one is mercifully skied. By the way,
the late President, Mr. Julian Ashton, is not
represented at all this year.
• * *
In the array of sculpture, the most noticeable
and successful contribution is the life-size model of
“ The Sculler (apparently Peter Kemp)—Ready ”
(327), by Mr. I). H. Batchen, who has evidently
devoted much study to the subject. The pose is
easy and natural, and, as the man has been trained
down fine, the artist has had a chance of showing
his knowledge of anatomy. M. Emile Leysalle
occupies much space with his busts and medallions
of more or less known celebrities, but the like-
nesses (omitting one of Minister Suttor, an excel-
lent work) do not strike one as being particularly
good. Of Signor fHni's wonderful half-length of
Mr. Henry Parkes, nothing more need bo said
than that it is thoroughly worthy of the gifted
author of the Sydney Post office carvings.
What has become of little Hodgkinson ?
Whenever one of the Q Labour-party gel 8
up to speak in the House his mates lie low fo l
the MTlwraithian interjectors. The consequent:
is that Morehead has now developed into one o‘
the quietest and best-behaved men in the room.
At the time of going to press the discovery
of a baby-mine was reported from a back-yard at
Bruns wt k (Melbourne). The first crushing yielded
a return of five dead infants, and experts are in-
clined to think that the reef is rich and permanent.
The police are now sinking on the underlay. Con-
sidering how rarely anybody in Australia digs up
his back yard, and how frequently a dead infant is
discovered when the unusual experiment is made,
The Bulletin suggests the advisability of enact-
ing that every back yard in Australia should at
once be dug to a depth of four feet. The result,
on a rough estimate, should be about 100,000 babies
at the very least—and an advt. in the daily press
calling for tenders for 10,000 well-soaped ropes.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
What the Australian Eleven lack (remarks Ihe
Bulletin’s London correspondent) is some one amongst
them to whom they can look up. Murdoch used to keep
them in good order by sheer force of will, and the pre-
sence of Massie had a wonderful effect upon the team of
which he was a member, and which was probably the
best you have sent over. Blackham is personally well
liked, but he has no real influence over his men—hence
alt the trouble. Victor Cohen is a complete nonentity,
except so far as looking after the cash is concerned. It is
a thousand pities that, failing an effective captain, some
one like Mr. F. H. Dangar is not asked to keep some kind
of moral control over the teams which represent Aus-
tralia. It would make a wonderful difference, for he
could talk to them “ like a father” when necessary, and
as he is so much liked and respected, a word from him
would go far to keep the men straight. Unless something
of this kind be done on future occasions, we shall not
see Australian cricketers doing themselves justice. The
“Guide, Philosopher, and Friend ” need not necessarily
interfere with the team in any way, but he would exer-
cise, as I have said, a strong moral control over the
party and suppress bickerings. It is grievous to see
matters going as they are with the team of 1893, which
will be remembered for the unequal form it has shown all
through.
# * *
W. G. Grace, says the cable, intends to resign
the captaincy of the Gloucestershire eleven, owing to
differences he has had with the executive. Well, it is
rank blasphemy to call W. G. Grace a duffer of a captain,
but that’s what he frequently appears to be. With only
half-an-hour left for play, and the light shockingly bad,
he will open an innings with his crack batsmen. In the
ordinary way he takes Stoddart to the wickets with him,
in preference to Shrewsbury or Gunn, the best men in
England for breaking the attack. In working his bowlers
he is evidently swayed by prejudice, otherwise he
wouldn't have dispensed with Brockwell’s services in the
last All England match. Except to those who worship
the “old man” as a fetish it has often seemed that
Blackham or Murdoch could give him points at managing
a game, especially of late when W.G. himself has probably
been managed by Lord Sheffield.
mm*
The much-abused Walter Giffen hasn’t shaped
so badly after all, remarks The Bulletin's London cor-
respondent. He is seldom selected to play, but when he
is he generally makes some runs, and his fielding has been
very good. It might be risky to try him in a big match,
Mr. CHARLES WESTBROOK.
but I don’t think he would disgrace himself. Brother
George may not be so far wrong as some people think.
* * *
A big item against the Australians has been
“extras.” Blackham is no longer the wicket-keeper he
was, and naturally cannot stand up to fast bowling as he
used in his younger days, say about twenty years
ao-o. Still, he is brilliant at times and snaps many a
catch with his old quickness. But hard knocks are not
to his liking now—and small blame to him.
# # #
The Australian representative team (writes The
Bulletin’s London correspondent) is not quite a “band
of brothers.” There are hints of matters going so far as
that men miss catches purposely to spoil certain other
men’s bowling averages. W. W. Read told somebody the
other day that one man deliberately dropped a catch,
which, if held, would have possibly won the match for
Australia against the English team. Things must be very
bad when such statements are made, even if they have no
foundation of truth.
# * *
Rumour says George Giffen has acted like a
spoilt child in England. If not put on to bowl he sulked;
and Coningham’s exclusion has not been so much on
account of his monkey-tricks in the field as through
George’s objecting to his inclusion if Brother Walter was
left out,

Spofforth still retains some of his devil. Play-

runs a wicket.

A private letter from the States says “ Griffo ”
is at the same old game. His people lose him for days at
a stretch.
Seldom has the clever division such a crasher
served out to it as at Canterbury Park (Sydney), last
pony meeting. For such caille as Morpheus, Lady
Redfern, Cecil, and Mikado to “go down” when backed
from 6 to 4 against to 5 to 2 on is pretty well a record.
* * *
May The Bulletin be permitted to bring under
the notice of the young bloods and medicos, who now
form Sydney’s punting brigade, the finishing-up of
Walton, Benzon, and all other plungers ?

Some big dividends were paid on the Sydney
“totes” on Saturday. On one, Cannon, winner of the
Spring Handicap, paid over £4OO for £l. On another,
the same horse paid nearly £l5O for 10s. Lullaby, winner
of the Tramway Handicap, paid about £195 for 10s.
* # *
The hurdles on all N.S.W, racecourses should
be uniform. Either the A.J.O. should use brush hurdles
on their course or compel the proprietary clubs to con-
form to the Randwick style of plain rails. The horses
came down like ninepins at Randwick on Saturday.
Placid, in the midst of a large field, evidently did not see
the plain rail at all, as he crashed fair on to the top of it,
and his jockey escaped death by a miracle.

A Victorian account of a Bunbury
(W.A.) cricket-match tells how a Gumsuck-
ing 11 played “ the rest of the available
universe.”' A Gumsucker skied the first ball
bowled into a three - pronged branch of a
tall jarrah-tree. The “Universe” claimed
“lost ball,” but the umpire ruled that it was
“in sight,” and, therefore, not “lost.” The
Victorians started running, while the Uni-
verse sent for an axe to fell the tree ; no
axe being procurable, a rifle was obtained
and the ball shot down after numerous
misses; score on the one hit, 586. The
Gumsuokers “stood” on that, and the Uni-
verse went in. The first “full-pitcher” hit
the batsman on the cobra, and the umpire
promptly gave him “ out, leg before wicket.”
The Victorians won.

A New York paper: “The best
fighters wo ever had in this country have
come from the Antipodes, but we have
enough on hand to entertain the American
sporting public for a long time to come, so
if the gentlemen from the South Seas would
only remain at home until the supply we
have on hand is used up, why then we
would be delighted to receive some more.”

English papers tell of a well-known
clubman who, for years, had entered the
club Derby sweep and never drawn a horse.
So accustomed had he become to his ill-luck
that he never thought of looking to see what
he had drawn. The day after the last Derby,
as he entered the club, he was handed a letter.
He opened it and a cheque for several hun-
dred pounds fell out. He had drawn the
winnerl He fell dead on the spot.
A military cricket-match in India was made
remarkable by a ball hitting a fieldsman on the helmet,
denting the head-covering and resting there. The umpire
gave the batsman out.

Victorians now talk of avoiding the Divorce

The Sydney Eight Hours Demonstration
will be held at Rosehill on Monday, October 2,
prox., and the added excitement of an art union,
in which each ticketholder will have a chance,
should give zest to the turnout. The big prize is
a house, value £BOO, to be purchased by the
demonstration trustees in any locality chosen by
the winner; other notable prizes are—a piano
value =£oo, a bedroom suite, and a Haydn organ ;
while there are 250 other prizes ranging in value
from <£lß 10s. to 10s. 6d. The art union will be
drawn on the next succeeding Saturday, Oct. 7.
Tickets are 2s. each, and can be secured by post,
or from various places notified elsewhere in our

years with
CANCER OF THE LIP.
Agonizing: torture relieved, Disease Cured.
“lam 55 years of ago, and until 1884 had al-
ways enjoyed good health. About that t me, a
little hard bunch, like a wart, appeared on my
lower lip. Finally, the bunch gathered, broke,
and formed a sore; then it began to eat into the
flesh. The Cancer—for that is what the doctors
finally called it—kept getting worse and worse,
year after year. It caused me great pain and
uneasiness. During the last year, I would wake
twenty times in a night, suffering intensely
from twitching pains. It was as if my flesh
was being torn from me by pinchers, bit by bit
At last, I began to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
In the course of a week or two I noticed a
decided improvement. The twitching and the
pains were very much less, and the sore began
to look healthier. In three months my lip
began to heal, and, after using the Sarsaparilla
for six months, the last trace of the Cancer dis-
appeared, and left very little scar.”—-J. E. Nich-
olson, Florenceville, N. 8., Canada. f

Dear Bulletin, —In a recent railway-
arbitration case in Brisbane (Q.), an opposing
barrister used to get Sam Griffith’s dander up
visibly by showily perusing the last issue of The
Bulletin in Court. Now that Sam is Chief
Justice, does any barrister dare to exhibit the
“ red cover ” in his court ? —Yours, Mad Bull.
Dear Bulletin, —What sort of sheep were
they shorn by Howe? Did they have any wool
on ? It used to take a hummer to shear 140 to
IGO of full-fleeced Darling sheep. Bendigo Jaok
Ellis did 270 odd, but it was just after a bad
drought, and the wool was rotten and would fall
off itself. — Bill Lyons, Macclesfield, Vic.
A kind of four-cornered “duel” is pro-
ceeding in England re the opinions as to Home
Rule held by Australian statesmen. Vogel and
Phillip Mennell hold that most of our leading
politicians are opposed to it, whilst on the other
side Arthur Clayden and J. F. Hogan maintain
that the majority is in favour of self-government for
Ireland. The Bulletin’s firm belief is that the
majority of so-called Australian “statesmen ” are
in their hearts altogether opposed to Home Rule ;
but, to quote Abigail, “they dussn’t say it on the
’listings.”
From the Australian Star’s latest flog-
ging report :
The punishment was a very severe one, but when
released from the frame to which he was strapped,
Maguire, with a spirit of braggadocio that was not alto-
gether unexpected, blasphemously remarked, “1 thought
it was worse than that.”
“Blasphemously!” According to the dictionary,
blasphemy is “an indignity offered to God.” The
cat is the God of the capitalistic press, and
Maguire offered it an indignity.
Max O’Rell: “I, for my part, do nob
doubt that the Americans will abolish death-sen-
tences before long. They are too intelligent not
to understand that the death-sentence deters no
criminal, and this for a very simple reason. A
crime is committed under the impulse of passion,
or it has been premeditated. In the first case the
criminal never thinks of the punishment to come ;
in the second, he always believes he has p’.mned
his crime in such a manner as not to be found
out.” Exactly. They hung Conder at Melbourne
the other day. Well? Conder, if guilty, killed
his man and burnt his bones. He never expected
to be found out. Had he expected to be found
out, he would not have committed the murder.
He was very frightened when about to be hanged.
But you want the murderer to be afraid before he
commits the murder. He never is and nev-r will
be. The secret, deliberate murderer, like Coud r,
orNicholls, or Lester, or Deeming, whether sane
or mad, calculates everything. Always a srre.it
egotist, his egotism makes him believe himself in-
vulnerable. The other sort of murderer does a t
calculate at all.
Gladstone, by amending Ins original Home
Rule Bill so that the Irish members will still vote
in Westminster on English as well as Imperial
questions, has given the House of Lords anew
lease of power. That body will argue, when firing
out the measure, that the electors have as yet, had
no opportunity of deciding upon the advisability of
allowing 80 members, having a distinct parliament
of their own, to assist to vote taxes which their
own constituents will not pay and to make laws in
whose operations they will not have the slightest
concern.
Graham Berry, as leader of the Victorian
Opposition, is dropping more and more out of
sight, and Shiels is again coming to the front.
Berry is too old and feeble and broken for much
real fighting, and as almost every row in the
House relates, more or less directly, to his own
odoriferous Mercantile Bank —in fact, almost all
Victorian politics depend on the Mercantile Bank
these times—he is practically compelled to stand
out. But Shiels nowadays seems to have entirely
forgotten his own reluctance to proceed in the
matter of that famous institution, and the manner
in which he heaps contumely upon O’Loghlen and
Patterson makes that pair long to attend his
funeral.
The prospectus of the “ Queensland Co-
operative Settlement Association,” which pro-
jected body intends to apply for a settlement site
on the Herbert River, discloses a co-operative but
not communistic programme. All land and im-
provements are to remain the indivisible property
of the Association. A sinking-fund is to be set
aside to purchase the shares of those leaving or
dismissed from it, or of members’ legatees who
may not care to join. Another fund is to be
provided to maintain widows and incapacitated
members and to pay for necessary medical atten-
dance and maintain schools, &c. Peppercorn
rentals on “indeterminable lease” to each head
of each household are to be the vogue. A uniform
rate of wages—first in labour-notes recognised at
the co-operative store, and afterwards to be
redeemed in current legal tender—will be credited
to the account of every member; half of such
credit can be drawn in gold for necessary business
outside the settlement. An annually-elected
guild of five will manage the community ; depart-
mental regulations to be confirmed by a majority
of adults. Expulsions to require a five-sixths
majority. No grog to be sold on the estate, and
every member to be a pledged total abstainer.
Each member to subscribe in money and goods at
least J 250 towards the Association within two
years of admission; each member to “subscribe
all his possessions, with the exception of wearing
apparel, furniture, &o.” Much, probably,
depends on this “&c.” “No child under 10 will
be allowed to leave the school. “Every inducement
will be held out to single members to marry, and
found for themselves happy and comfortable
homes.” As how?—seeing that only “ a certain
number of single women shall be admitted as full
members, as vacancies occur in the dairy or other
departments where their labour can be profitably
utilised.” Immorality strictly forbidden.

“Tom’s Selection.”
(A Sketch of Settling on the Land.)
(FOR THE BULLETIN. )
The worst bore in Australia just now is
the man who raves about “gittiu’ the people on
the land,” and corners you in the street with a
little scheme of his own. He doesn’t generally
know what he is talking about.
There is in Sydney a man named Tom Hopkins
who settled on the land once, and sometimes you
can get him to talk about it. He did very well at
his trade in the city, years ago, until he began t 0
think that he could do better up-country. Then
he arranged with his sweetheart to be true to him
and wait whilst he- went West and made a home.
She drops out of the story at this point.
He selected on a ruri at Dry Hole Creek, and
for months awaited the arrival of the Government
surveyors to fix his boundaries ; but they didn’t
come, and, as lie had no reason to believe they’d
turn up within, say, ten years, he grubbed
and fenced at a venture, and started farming-
operations.
* * *
Does the reader know what “grubbin’”
means? Tom does. He found the biggest,
ugliest, and most useless trees on his particular'
piece of ground; also the greatest number of
adamantine stumps. He started without experience
—or with very little, but he had plenty of advice
from men who knew less about it than he did. He
found a soft place between two roots on one side
of the first tree, made a narrow, irregular hole,
and burrowed down till he reached a level where
the tap-root was somewhat less than four feet in
diameter, and not quite as hard as flint; then he
found that he hadn t room to swing the axe, so he
heaved out another ton or two of earth—and
rested. Next day he sank a shaft on the other
side of the gum ; and after tea, over a pipe, it
struck him that it would be a good idea to bum
the tree out, and so use up the logs and lighter
rubbish lying round. So he widened the excava-
tion, rolled in some logs, and set fire to them—
with no better result than to scorch the roots.
# *
Tom persevered. He put the trace-har-
ness on his horse, drew in all the logs within
half-a mile, and piled them on the windward side
of that gum ; and during the night the fire found
a soft place, and the tree burnt off—about six feet
above the surface—falling on a squatter’s boundary-
fence and leaving the “ugliest ” kind of a stump
to occupy the selector’s attention ; which it did—
for a week. Tom waited till the hole cooled, and
then he went to work with pick, shovel, and axe;
and even now he gets interested in drawings of
m ichinery— such as are published in the agri-
c iltural weeklies—for getting out stumps without
hard work He thought he would be able to make
s rnie posts and rails out of that tree, but found
reason to think that a cast-iron column would
split sooner—and straighter. He traced some of
the surface roots to the other side of the selection,
and broke most of his trace-chains trying to get
them out by horse-power—for there were other
roots going down from underneath. He cleared a
patch in the course of time, and for several seasons
he broke more plough-shares than he could
pay for.
* * #
Meanwhile the squatter was not idle.
Tom’s tent was robbed several times, and his hut
burnt down twice. Then he was charged with
killing some sheep and a steer on the run, and
converting them to his own use, but got off mainly
because there was a difference of opinion between
the squatter and the other local J.P. concerning
politics and religion.
lorn ploughed and sowed wheat, but nothing
came up to speak of—the ground was too “poor ;”
so he carted stable manure live miles from the
next “town,” manured the land, sowed another
crop, and prayed for rain. It came. It raised a
flood which washed thecropcloan off the selection,
together with several acres of manure and a con-
siderable portion of the original super-soil; and
the water brought down enough sand to make a
beach, and spread it over the field to a depth of
six inches. The flood also took half a mile of
fencing from along the creek-bank, and landed it
in a bend, three mjJ.es down, on a dummy selec-
tion, Where it was Confiscated,
* * #
Tom didn’t give up—he was energetic. He
cleared another piece of ground, on the “siding,”
and sowed more wheat; it had “ the rust ” in it,
or “ the smut ” —and averaged three shillings per
bushel. Then Tom sewed lucerne and oats, and
bought a few cows ; he had an idea of starting a
dairy. First, the cows’eyes got bad, and he sought
the advice of a German “ coekie,” and acted upon
it ; lie blew powdered alum through paper tubes
into the bad eyes, and got some of it snorted and
butted back into his own.
Then the “milkers” got “bad udders,” and
Tom took his life in his own hands whenever he
milked them. He got them all right presently—
and butter fell to fourpence a pound. He and the
aforesaid “cockie ” made arrangements to send
their butter to a better market; and then Tom’s
cows contracted a disease which was known in
those parts as “ plooro permoanyer,” but generally
referred to as “ th’ ploorer.”
* * *
Again Tom sought advice, acting upon
which he slit the cows’ ears, cut their tails half
off to bleed them, and poured pints of “pain-
killer ” into them through their nostrils ; but they
wouldn’t “make an effort,” except, perhaps, to
prop the selector whenever he tried to tempt their
appetites with slices of immature pumpkin. They
died peacefully and persistently, until all were
gone save a certain dangerous, barren, slab-sided,
limy bovine with white eyes and much agility in
jumping fences,
Tom shot that cow—if cow she could be called—
and turned his attention to agriculture again.
Then his plough horses took bad with something
the Teuton called “der shtranguls.” He sub-
mitted them to a course of treatment in accord-
ance with Jacob’s advice—and they died.
* * #
Even then Tom didn’t give out — there "was
grit in that man. He borrowed a broken-down
dray-horse, for its keep, coupled it with his own
old riding-hack, and started to finish ploughing.
The team wasn’t a success. Whenever the draught
horse’s knees gave way and he stumbled forward,
he jerked the lighter horse, back into the plough,
and something would break. Then Tom would
blaspheme till he was refreshed, mend up things
with wire and bits of clothes-line, fill his pocket
with stones to throw at the team, and start again.
Finally he hired a dummy’s child to drive the
horses. The brat did his best: he tugged at the
head of the team, prodded it behind, heaved rooks
at it, cut a sapling, got up his enthusiasm and
wildly whacked the light horse whenever the other
showed signs of moving—but he never succeeded
in starting both horses at one and the same time.
Moreover the youth was cheeky, and (die selector’s
temper had been soured : he cursed the boy along
with the horses, the plough, the selection, the
squatter, and Australia. Yes, he cursed Aus-
tralia. _ The boy cursed back, was chastised, and
immediately went home and brought his father.
# # # ,
The dummy’s dog tackled the selector’s
dog and this precipitated things. The dummy
would have gone under had his wife not arrived
on the scene with the eldest son and the rest of
the family. They all fell foul of Tom—the woman
was the worst. The selector’s dog chawed the
other and came, to his master’s rescue just in time
—else Tom Hopkins would never have lived to
become the inmate of a lunatic asylum.
Next year there happened to be good grass on
Tom’s selection and nowhere else, and he thought
it wouldn’t be a bad idea to get a few “poor”
sheep, and fatten them.up for market; sheep were
selling for about 7s. fid. a dozen at that time.
Tom got a hundred or two, but the squatter had a
man stationed at one side of the selection with
dogs to set on the sheep directly they put their
noses through the fence (Tom’s was not a sheep
fence). The dogs chased the sheep across the
selection and into the run again, on the other side,
where another man waited ready to ’pound them.
* # #
Tom’s dog did his best; but he took sick
while chawing up the fourth capitalistic canine,
and subsequently died. The dummies had filled
that cur with poison before starting it across—
that was the only way they could get at Tom’s dog.
Tom thought that two might play at the game,
and he tried ; but his nephew, who happened to
be up from the city on a visit, was arrested at the
instigation of the squatter, for alleged sheep-
stealing, and sentenced to two years’ hard ; dqring
which time the selector himself got six months
for assaulting the squatter With intent to do him
grievous bodily harm —which, indeed, he more
than attempted, if a broken nose, a fractured jaw
and the loss of most of the squatter’s teeth
amounted to anything. Item ; The squatter by
this time had made peace with the other local
“Justice,” and had become his father-in-law,
# # *
When Tom came out there was little left
for him to live for ; but he took a job of fencing,
got a few pounds together, and prepared to settle
on the land some more. He got a “missus,” and
a few' cows, during the next year; the missus
robbed him and ran away with the dummy, and
the cows died of drought, or were impounded by
the squatter while on their way to water. Then
Tom rented an orchard up the creek, and a hail-
storm destroyed all the fruit. He got a bit dis-
heartened, but he did another job of fencing, and
was just beginning -to think about “puttin’ in a
few vines an’ fruit trees ” when the Government
surveyors—whom he’d forgotten all about—had a
resurrection and came and surveyed, and found
that the real selection was located amongst some
barren ridges across the creek. Tom reckoned it
was lucky he didn’t plant the orchard, and he
went about shifting his home and fences to the
new site. But the squatter interfered at this
point, entered into possession of the farm and all
on it, and took action against the selector for
trespass—laying the damages at .£2500.
# ~ * *
Tom was admitted to the lunatic-asylum at
Parramatta next year, and the squatter was sent
there the' following summer, having been ruined
by the drought, the rabbits, the banks, and a wool-
ring. The two got very friendly together, and
had many a sociable argument about the feasibility
—or otherwise—of blowing open the floodgates of
Heaven, in a dry season, with dynamite.
Tom was discharged a few years since. He
knocks about certain suburbs a good deal, but is
seldom seen in daylight; in fact, that is not
exactly the time during which he earns his living.
He says his one great regret is that he wasn’t
found to be of unsound mind before ever he went
up-country.

(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
Dying ! in the sheltering shade
That the myall branches made,
While the horse-bells clanged and tinkled, far
away across the plain ;
The white stars above were blinking,
As old Pat Magee lay thinking
Of the faces and the places he would never see
again.
That long trip—his life —is over,
And the grizzled, gaunt old drover
Gives “delivery;” hands his way-bill to his
Owner, up above.
Whether, now, a heaven or hell come,
Pat will find old mates to welcome —
Saints a few and sinners many ’mong the ones he
used to love.
Lived his years—some five-and-fifty—
Neither over-wise nor thrifty ;
Many times he “ went a bender ” from the sober
way and straight;
Yet men found in days of trouble
Paddy’s friendship was no bubble,
And he never wronged a woman nor went back
upon a mate.
And the Boss of all the bosses
May be lenient to the “ losses ”
On the track that Paddy travelled there were
bound to be a few.
Maybe He who pays the wages
Knows how weary were some “stages,”
And there’ll be a big “percentage,” p’rhaps,
allowed on coming through.
So we dug upon the ’Bidgee,
Fenced it round with stakes of gidgee,
Paddy’s grave ! for burial-service Jack just
whispered, “Rest his soul!”
Then next morning, heavy-hearted,
Got the nags up and departed,
Did what Pat himself had ne’er dofie—left a
comrade in a hole.

When eastern sky is lifting high
That changeful cov’ring night
And pushing it, with clouds sun-lit,
Away from coming light,
We often get—while darkness yet
Toward the west is creeping—
jtn touch just then with those strange uieii
Who work when we are sleeping.
When here and there are chimneys where
The kindling fire smoke shows,
And o’er tlie gate—in printed freight—
What work ! the newsboy throws;
We surely find then if our mind
A watchful eye is keeping

To work when we were sleeping.
When voiced With bells the clock-tower tells
The hour distinctly clear,
And on the street —in transit fleet—
The niilkmeri’s carts appear.
Then scatt’ring crowds, like dusty clouds
The broom of fate is sweeping,
From doorways drift — the tired night-shift
That worked wheii We were sleeping.
Yes ! what a host the men can boast
Who work throughout the night,
What visions cbmfe to vis of some
In gas and furnace light,
HoW little, too, We ever knew
Of benefits we’re reaping
o*er and again, from linknOwn men,
Who work when we are sleeping.
We can’t forget and silent let
Our brothers of the night,
Each morn pass by, without a cry,
And vanish from our sight;
And so from hs—as at you thus
In fancy’s frolic peeping—
Good rnotning ! then, you mighty men,
Who work when we are sleeping.

The horror of the swift, Sure and apparently painless

of death, ft was execution reduced to its lowest terms.
It had all the character of a private and unauthorised
murder; there were no accessories to deflect the mind
from the one absorbing object of terrible interest; What
filled men’s minds was not death as a just punishment for
Crime, but the bare dreadfulness Of life destroyed deliber-
ately under One’s eyes. It will be a wonder if these

A Maoriland. paper gives the following
impressive account of that melancholy tomfoolery,
the Oddfellows’ “ initiation ceremony” :
Each brother present was masked. The presiding
officer wore a long white beard and wig, an apron of white
leather bound in scarlet, with the emblems of mortality
painted thereon; and on a pedestal before him were
similar real ones. Two other officers wore respectively
yellow and blue cloaks; while the treasurer, secretary,
and almoner in white surplices stood behind the altar of
Obligation. Others had aprons bound with purple, edged
with gold lace. The fittings for the initiation consisted of
loose planks to form an imaginary road, with rough knots
left at intervals; some faggots of wood and bundles Of
cork so arranged as to form rocks and forests ; a small
brazier with fire ; a shower bath ; and the usual theatrical
appliances for the tempest scene. The candidate fot
membership was led into the Lodge-room carefully blind-
folded. After passing the two Guardians he felt a peculiar
and mysterious awe steal over his senses, in consequence
of the solemn and deathlike silence that prevailed. He
Was suddenly ordered as a presumptuous mortal to stand.
His perverted sense of hearing became fearfully awakened
by the rattling of huge irott chains and the Unmeaning
sounds produced by men’s voices. At this stage, he was
sometimes tumbled in among- brushwood, or soUsed over-
head into a large tub. Suddenly the bandages were Re-
moved, when he found a person with a sword presented
to his breast demanding of the assembly whether he
should show any mercy. On their answering in the affir-
mative he Was released and introduced to the death-scene.
There has been nothing like this since Mark
Twain’s small boy, Tom Sawyer, and his friend,
Huckleberry Finn, set to work to release the
nigger who was confined in the wood-shed, and, first
of ail, agreed, for the sake of style, to regard him as
the son of Louis XVI. who had been imprisoned
for forty years or thereabouts in the Bastille.
Then, though they had the key of the door, they
perspired for a week or so digging a subterranean
passage—also for the sake of style, and made the
nigger’s life a misery by making him spend his
nights engraving on the wall pathetic remarks
about his_ lost mother, Marie Antoinette. The
secret society is Tom Sawyer over again without
bis humour, and the tailor and the eheese-and-
ham man belong to it, principally because it
makes them feel mysterious and darkly piratical,
and more or less like persons with a horrid secret
buried in a cave.
Attached td Darlinghurst prison is an
officer Whose duty it is to be present whenever a
man is arraigned for a capital crime. He must
be there When the verdict is returned ; if a con-

all at the coroner’s inquest.
Eighty members are sufficient to do the
work of Parliament in N.S.W. With 141 and
more coming, the bores have too many facilities.
Practically the bore has three audiences. The
first lot comes in before tea, and consists of the
Labour members, Ministers Of the Crown, the
lawyers, and a few country members. The second
lot comes in after tea and stays till 10 p.m. They
consist of the Labour members, the business mem
who come late and go away early, giving the few
hours snatched from their private affairs to the ser-
vice of their country. Then comes the third set, con-
sisting of the Labour members, reinforced by the
dilettanti, who roll in from the theatre, Govern-
ment House, or private social engagements, to
look around for half-an-hour. With these changes
of audience the bore pegs away, with speech after
speech, witticism after witticism, point of order
after point of order. With the exception of the
Labour members, none of the three sets remains
long enough to reach the stage when the bore
would be promptly squelched.
The famous loan of £1,000,000, floated in
Melbourne by Premier Shiels, before he fell
through the suspicion that he was going to
inquire into Matthew Davies, has at last been
„ Q ; J ,/y If a wonrlprfnl nnrl rb'sastrmis snec
paid off. It was a wonderful and disastrous spec.
The loan was for two years, and was negotiated
through the N. Z. Loan and Mercantile Agency,
at 4| per cent. It was intended to be the begin-
ning of a local borrowing policy, but as the N. Z.
L. and M. Co. raised the cash in London it wasn’t
local. It was raised at a discount of £lO,OOO.
Then it dawned on Shiels that he dared not sink
the money in public works as it bad to be repaid
inside of two years, so it was put on fixed
deposit in various banks at 3J per cent., the loss
in interest being £25,000. When a permanent
loan was floated, a few months, later, there was
trouble in London about Victoria s frequent boi-
rowings, and the bonds had to be sold at a serious
reduction—further estimated loss, £20,000. The
million narrowly escaped being “reconstructed”
on several occasions, and it made Graham
-r, , _„i„ dutpi- tviviioiiiT
Berry prematurely old and Shiels pa t y
demented. Finally, Treasurer Carter ships a
million sovereigns to London to pay it off freight
and charges on the shipment £lO,OOO, making
the total loss £6s,ooo—and if there is any poetic
justice in heaven the vessel that carries it will
never again be heard of.

narrator. “ When I was a boy, ah ! then they
were thick. I was after a mob o’ scrubbers up
iu the ranges and my mare bolted. She ran into
a tree, broke her neck and fell atop of me. I lay
jammed under her, with both thighs and three of
ray ribs broken. How I was to get away 1 didn’t
know, but the dingoes came in the night and ate
up every bit of the mare, and in the morning I
was able to crawl to the station. My oath, they
were thick in those days.”
Oolemane & Sons’ Eucal. Loz. are for the Voice.
Isaacs, M.L.A., On a recent Pleasant Sun-
day Afternoon, told the people of Melbourne that
a State is in character the sanje as the individuals
of whom it is composed. If they have squire
individuals they can have a sqiiare State. That’s
satisfactory anyhow :
Cleverly expounded—
DoctriHe bright and fair,
If a thing be rounded
Then it isn’t sqUare.
State of matters awful
Ruling in the land,
Nothing thought unlawful
By the robber band.
Things beconle chaotic—
Such a shocking mess !
Boomers patriotic
Pity the distress ;
See the land despairing—
Save it from its fate.
“Sudden need for squaring—
Let us ‘ square ’ the State.’’
Since the days of Sarah
(Abraham’s old gal)
Never State had squarer
City capital.
In the darkness groping,
’Midst the gloom profound,
Nincompoops keep hoping
Melbourne’s “coming round,”
Oolemane & Sons’ Eucalypte Ex. is the strongest.
Extracts from the private letter of an
Australian in England, to a Bulletin man
Tipping is universal. 1 believe the Lord Chancellor
himself would tip “on the dead quiet.” Everybody
is civilservile. Tell a man to go to hell and he will
say, “Yes, sir; thank you, sir; what part of hell shall I
go to, sir ?” Everybody crawls, masses and classes alike,
crawling tier above tier till you get to royalty. I don’t
know Whom royalty crawls to—its God, perhaps, if it has
one—but it must crawl. Last night I saw Whitechapel,
Such an abyss of ignorance, vice, and misery, no pen
could describe, no imagination conceive. Think of
the impudence of the English in sending mis-
sionaries with rum and a risen Christ to the
sweet • souled Japanese—and such a den of degrada-
tion under their very noses! At Bow-street, the other
day, two boys of 12 and 14 got 10 days each for pitch-and-
toss. The very day before, the Prince of Wales and the
aristocracy went to Ascot, and lost or won a quarter of a
million in bets. One case struck me hard. A “swell”
met a poor abandoned, took her to his West End lodgings,
kept her there all night, and in the morning missed £2.
He set police after the woman, appeared in court with a
silk hat and Bond-street clothes to detail all the circum-
stances of the case, and got the wretched creature six
months. Tell me, who but a cold-blooded Englishman
could do that ?

“The Last of Six”:
Tales of the Austral Tropics.
By ERNEST FAVENC.
With Prefatory Note by Bolf Boldrewood.
Says the celebrated author of “Robbery Under Arms” In these " Tales of the Austral Tropics ” will be found the
strange romances which write themselves, often in letters of blood, amid the half-unknown, mysterious regions or tropical Aus-
tralia That they are not less true than terrible, I take it upon myself to affirm. That such is far from being the case with the
larger proportion of literary manufacture professing to describe Australian life and character, I must distinctly assert . lose

author’s name is a household word among bushmen and bookmen from Albany to Thursday Island, from Ihe Gulf to the

“ Alike to him the sea, the shore.
The pen, the bridle and the oar.”
To him, familiar as highways are the endless solitudes of the “ Never Never Country ”-

(Published at SYDNEY, N.S.W.)
The Unique Weekly—Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
“The Bulletin,”
Premier Australian Literary Journal,
It the only paper which has a consistent and dis-
tinctive Australian National Policy,
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
One Person, one Vote.
Complete Secularisation and Freedom of State

A Universal System of Compulsory Life

The Referendum.
The Abolition of Titles of so-called “ nobility.”
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
"paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter that is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started 13 years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become the representative Australian
journal, because it possesses a vitality lacked
by the countless news paper-ventures in which
Australian capitalists have unavailingly spent
large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after tho
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen moro-or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues tho one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, tho one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established A us-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress; it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now aiflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who claim
to monopolise salvation, aerainst the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised, The
Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and tho colonies.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bnshman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the Maoriland
Ranges. A paper which is at once the most
popular city publication and the organ of the
intelligent Bushman must indeed he broadly based.
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin’s
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact —
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the ono most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is going ahead raster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is tho brightest
and beat, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy tho boldest and most
straightforward .ever submitted to the Australian
public
