UNDCR THE
GUMTREC
EOBERT BARR, the Scotc-
h novelist, has
been endeavouring to
boom Ambrose Bierce in
England. He suggests Bierce’s lite-
rary equality with Kipling; but
misses the vital point in which
Kipling is superior—humanity.
For intellectual strength Bierce’s
stories are better than Kipling’s;
but they are colder, harder, less
vital. They impress the head : Kip-
ling has a knack of touching the
heart as well.
Jt,
Barr incidentally tells how Kip-
ling, in his early English career,
suppressed “The Book of the
Forty-five Mornings ” sketches
and stories which Barr considered
as good as “Plain Tales.” Kipling re-
torted: “As good isn’t good enough. It
must be better, or it won’t be published.”
And it is only now, when Kipling’s ill-
ness has thrown him behind with his work, that
the book is to be issued under the title “From
Sea to Sea.”
oJ* &
And Barr continues—
On Kipling’s first London desk he carved with his jack-
knife the words which the galley slave cut into the handle
of his oar, “Oft was! weary when I toiled at thee.” He
believed in downright dogged hard work, and the result
appeared to give him no concern. He accepted no con-
tracts when they began to pour in upon him, wrote
exactly what he wanted to write, and left the business
end of the industry to a business man.
Now an author seems to me like a carter with several
loads of stone which he dumps into a pond. The first
load goes plump into the water and disappears ; likewise
the second and the third, leaving no sign, and the work
seems rather hopeless. But by-and-bv a load is dumped
that remains above the surface, and lies there in the sight
of all men. Now the last load would not have been in
the sight of anyone were it not for the other loads that
preceded it. If Kipling had contented himself with one
book, he might have gone back to India, written
“Recessional,” and the poem would never have been
heard of.
Which is true. For the “Recessional ” was heard
of firstly, because Kipling wrote it; secondly, be-
cause it was cleverly composed to suit the
English—it waved their Jingo flag while it smote
their Nonconformist conscience; and only thirdly,
because it was decent verse. It is said that
“ Recessional ” was rescued by Mrs. Kipling from
the basket where the dissatisfied author had
thrown it; and if the story is true, it shows that
K. is a better judge of his own “poetry ’’ than are
many of the people who praise him.
Barr’s conclusion is (in effect) that Bierce is not
popular because he is too fond of writing as he
pleases to care about _ conciliating the public.
“ Bierce is too full of original Hell to succeed in a
Presbyterian world.”
JS jt
“ An Irish priest’s sermon to his congregation:
‘I have come this morning to say three things to
you. The first is something which I know, but
which you cannot know, and that is: I tore my
cassock climbing through the gap in the hedge.
The second is something which I do not know,
but which you all know, and that is : how much
you will give me towards buying a new one. The
third is what none of us know, and that is : how
much the spalpeen of a Protestant tailor will
charge for making it.’ ” As this is taken from The
Outlook, it seems fair to say that The Outlook has
been more interesting, lately; and I would not
willingly read without it.
The new sixpenny novel will doubtfully pay
English authors and publishers as well as the old
six-shilling one. The Outlook gives an estimate
and some figures—
Say, for a minimum output of 50,000 copies (gross
price 6d): —Production and advertising, 2d. Ten per
cent, to the author absorbs |d. For this the publisher
receives from the trade, 3{4cl. Leaving him as profit—Jd.
Examples: R. L. Stevenson’s “Treasure Island” for
the six months to December 31,1898, sold 43,323 copies ;
profit to author, £99 19s. 6d. “ Kidnapped ” in less than
six months sold 59,150 ; profit £136 10s. “Catriona” to
date has sold about 50,000 ; and “ King Solomon’s Mines’*
120,000—0 f course, with corresponding profits.
And the conclusion is that, considering how the
market is swamped with literature, for new novels
the old price would pay better—the large sale does
not make up for the small profit.
In spite of the much-increased cost of printing
and binding, the local author, in respect of the new
style of publication recently introduced, does not
fare so badly if he can command a reasonable sale.
The cost of producing 1000 copies of a book like
Brady’s “The Ways of Many Waters” is about
Fl4O ; of which about FIOO goes for printing,
paper, and stereotyping, and about £4O for bind-
ing and binders’ cloth. Allowing for deductions
and discounts, about 3s. per copy for 950 copies is
received from the booksellers, and about 50 copies
are given for review. Receipts : £142 10s.
Thus the production of 1000 copies barely covers
expenses ; and the persons who chiefly profit from
the author’s work are the local printer and binder
and bookseller. If the book continues to sell,
however, the cost is reduced by printing from
stereotype plates ; and *with the second and
succeeding thousands the- author and publisher
begin to receive some reward for their labour. Of
the ss. which the public pay for a successful book
like Paterson’s “ The Man from Snowy River ” the
wholesale and retail booksellers take the lion’s
share of 2s. per copy ; printing costs about 9d. per
copy ; binding about 7d. ; and advertising and in-
cidentals 2d. or 3d. ; so that author and publisher
usually divide Is. 6d. per copy—after having
nourished a considerable number of local indus-
tries. Ninepence per copy on a ss. book is
equivalent to a royalty of 15 per cent., which is
very rarely paid in England on an author’s first
venture. English royalties to an author like
Kipling are reputed to run as high as 25 per cent.;
but from 10 to 121 is the average; and it needs
a popular book, or a high price, to pay for pub-
lishing at anything beyond 15 per cent. —even
allowing for the cheapness of English production.
t
London’s newer Sunday journalism was a shrewd
knock to the Old Order of English things, and the
Old Order knocked back as hard as it knows
how. One clergyman solemnly burnt one heathen
sheet in his pulpit: the h.s. wished all the
others would buy and burn too. Exeter Hall
was hysterical, and a large section of the
13.1. supported Exeter on grounds less of reli-
gion than of weekly rest. The Daily Tele-
graph, with the more Respectable constituency,
climbed down first ; the Daily Mail continued
longer—with no particular benefit to a reader at
this.distance, though doubtloss to tli6 great con-
venience of many Londoners. Sooner or later, of
course, the attempt is bound to be re-made ; and
there is no more reason why a modern man should
go without his Sunday newspaper than without
his Sunday dinner.
“Don’t write my life,” said Thackeray. And
his daughter wouldn’t, anil his publishers didn’t;
though the prefaces to the Biographical edition of
T’s works infringe the spirit of the injunction, if not
the letter. But, inasmuch as a life is wanted, into
the field comes Richmond—a tyro author, Lewis
Melville, with two big volumes for 325., ,and some
cheerful chapter headings—“ The Tragedy of
Thackeray s Married Life,” “The Quarrel with
Edmund Fates ’’—the very things which Thackeray
wished to bury fathoms deep. And, says a London
correspondent, there is a very pretty row in pros-
pect.

His father-in-law, the Earl of Carlisle’s influence

his Greek alone might have served—there seemed

to be no end to his Oxford scholarships. George
Gilbert Aime Murray is third son of the late
Terence Aubrey ditto, 1862-73 Pres, of N.S.W.
Leg. Council; and he seems to have succumbed to
a consensus of tired feelings after burning both
ends of the candle for twenty years. His
“Ancient Greek Literature” —brilliant, indepen-
dent, and thorough—would have delighted old Dr.
Badham. The play of “Carlyon Sahib,” just
acted for copyright purposes, he wrote six years
ago.

Sample of criticism by Dr. Robertson Nicoll,
editor of Eng. Bookman and log-roller who walketh
in darkness—“ the most memorable work of a new
writer I have read during the year is to be found
in the last seventy or eighty pages of ‘ Zack’s ’ Life
is Life. The most serious and important book in
belles-lettres I have seen is Mr. Hardy’s Wessex
Poems.”
“ Treb ” complains—
Why does Roderic Quinn, in a recent “Red
Page ” sketch, sneer at the native salmon ? —a
common error. Salmon is certainly not as good
as schnapper or whiting, but it is by no means to
be despised. Another much-maligned fish is the
leather-jacket, which nearly every fisherman
throws overboard. If they only knew it, leather-
jacket is one of the very best fisli we have.
Some correspondence—
E.E. sends five “ Australia ” quatrains, the first
of which rhymes “tool’’with “jewel.” That is
novel, but naughty.
Further versions of “ Mon Reve ” received from
R.H.A., E.11.H. ; “Australia” quatrains from
R.H.A.; “Baudelaire’’translationfrom W.W.G.
E.H.H. writes —
Re Landor’s quoted “ best quatrain,” surely a better
is—
I strove with none, for none was worth my strife ;
Nature I loved, and next to Nature Art ;
I warmed both hands before the fire of life ;
It sinks, and I am ready to depart.
True ; these are four splendid lines, but are they
not rather a personal utterance than a Quatrain in
the wide yet special sense ?
E.B. : It is no use trying for Senancour and Co.
in Australia ; write direct to Williams and Nor-
gate, Covent Garden, London.
E.L.K. remarks—
In regard to W. Murdoch’s stupid criticism of Ogilvie’s
verses, about Daley’s book, noted in your issue of June 10,
compare the standing motto of the E'amily Herald Sup-
plement —
If a tenth part of the felicities that are enjoyed in the
region of imagination cbuld lie imported; into regions ter-
restrial, wliar. a delightful f hing it would be to awake each
morning to see such a world mice more !
I think that is almost precisely what Ogilvie meant—and
said—when he wrote
And I would be;content, content
With such sweet somts and such gold gleams,
Could all my dole of days he spent
In Daley’s land of Dreams.
THE BOOKFELLOW.
Sea Songs and Chanties.
L. J. Brady, in “ The Ways of Many Waters,”
has essayed a difficult task. It is more or less
easy to pen, an varying degrees of fluency, rhymes
of conventional correctness. It is extremely diffi-
cult to express emotion in the argot foreign to
one s own methods of thought and speech. Brady
has attempted this, and has, on the whole, suc-
ceeded. When the illiterate endeavor to imitate
the words peculiar to the educated, they are
seldom consistent in their corruptions. The Cock-
ney almost invariably says a ’orse ; but in moments
of extreme excitement he pronounces more
euphoniously and says an ’orse. Brady has
not forgotten this. His language is just
consistent enough to give assurance of actu-
ality—no more. Of course, when it is done
properly, diaiect furnishes a suit of piquant Doric
lit to the limbs of a well-proportioned thought-
body ; but it is a danger of subtle seductiveness to
clothe, not live thoughts, but hollow wire effigies
and frames of thought in the dress of dialect.
Jllow much of the alleged quaint philosophy cf
Josh Billings would outlive that phonetic sage’s
translation into the English, say, of Walter Pater?
What of humor there is in Brady is grim
enough, but it is the humor neither of dialect nor
ot verbal exaggeration. It is the humor of pessi-
mism mainly, of fatalism always ; but the pessi-
mism is charged with a certain cynical cheerful-
ness, and the fatalism takes its gruel with a manly
courage, washes down the fiat of the gods with a
. long-sleever of colonial “ swankey,” and - sings
swan s-song to the accompaniment of a pipe—
of fo csle-twist tobacco.
‘‘M‘Fee of Aberdeen” is the high-water mark
ot Brady’s lie.icon. This is the very model of a
sea-ballad - and it is all alive. The atmosj(here of
it is subtly preserved, and is touched with an old-
worldliness of ancient, birnacied craft and sailor--
men of a past fashion. One can see the ship of
the storm -battered Scots skipper, as in the rough
Atlantic waste “her bowsprit stabs the night”;
or when the sun goes down, goes down, and
turns her canvas red. Brady is prodigal of his
pictures : “ the darkened seas',” .the stars o’erliead
“ that splash the skies with sparkling
silver spray, out in the Great Un-
fathomed Deep, away, and still
away.” There is a delightful lilt in
the quaint old ballad repetition :
“They’ve seen the sun go down, go
down “ from morn to noon, from
noon to night ”; “ the wars may come,
the Wars may end, and crowns be
lost or won, he rolls around the roll-
ing world that rolls around the sun
“Aye, round the world, and round
the world, where’er his owners will”;
“ She’ll roll along, she’ll pitch along,
she’ll taek, and turn, and drive ”
and so on.
And what a sketch McFee is ! A
veritable descendant of the days when
‘‘ sailor-men( were 'sailor men, not sea-
sick engineers ! ” /The sailor and the
sailor’s singer are inspired by the three
things that sweeten life with pleasant
sin and make of Death a portal to per-
dition—drink, “wiminin,” and fight,
and Me Pee is the apotheosised type
of the poet’s hero. That craft of his,
tarry of rope and patched of sail,
“ he’ll take her out and bring her home,
or sink her, will McFee. ” He still
believes in the old boat built of teak,
though “men may write most wondrous
books, and men may count the stars, his
aim in life is -still to get all sail upon
his spars.” Creature comforts with him
are not many, but they are strong for
strong deeds in days of distress and death-th mi tun-
ings. A lusty glass of smoky Scotch, a pipe of
“duty-free” from the cabin jar, and the bland-
ishments of the light-o’-love in the port haven.
When he comes to talk of girls, Modesty shuts
hastily-shocked ears, for sailor-men are sailor-
men, “and Neptune rules the rolling deep, but
Venus reigns ashore,” and it’s “rest assured that
Venus is—as Venus was of yore.”
Brady, in his volume of thirty-four sea-songs
and chanties, seldom rings so true a note as an
“ MTee.” He writes with a swinging lilt—the
poems seem often to have written themselves.
Perhaps some of the verses should have been
omitted. The chanty of “The \ ■ Packet”
is not worthy of a volume a
which appears “MTee,’’and “W.
Viking Poray ” —a poem that sings
with a note like • cutlasses clashing,
The stevedoring verses are grimy
and sweaty actualities—all true
songs of unlovely labour. It’s
“yacker, yacker, yacker”for bread
and beer and ffiacoa, with the
grim necessity to graft ever present
in a rough, untutored yearning for
the welfare of the home and the mis-
sus and the kids. There is no liter-
ary finiekry in these axe-hewn
chants of work and worry and
wastrel carouse. Nor is there much
in the love-ditties of the tarry sons
of the seas, in their coarse apprecia-
tions of Sues and Loos and Nancy
Poos. Live and labour, live and
lieker, live and laugh and sail
away ; for the flesh is weak, and the
seas are deep and wide. There is
tragedy, too, as in “What the
Bottle Said;” recklessness and win . wine-{repre-
sented by deep potations of gin and rum and
beer) and eternal woman—of a certain class.
“The Ways of Many Waters,” the poem which
gives its name to the book, is a descriptive
panorama of historical-ewni.-geographical-gazetteer
description. It does not give Brady’s best poeti-
cal value, albeit it contains sun-gilt pictures of
visionary splendor. Brady is essentially the. singer
of the wharves and the ocean tramps and the un-
washed sailor-man in his least alluring moods.
The truth of the poet is his passport to public
favor. He gives, with no ungenerous hand, sea-
spume and ocean spray, and grease and dirt and
stench galore. “Hides and Tallow,” “Lost and
Given Over,” “The Whaler’s Pig,” “Wool, Ho!”
“ With Coal to Callao,” “ Roll the Cotton Down,”
“Nets Below the Gangway,” “Which His Weak-
ness is Women ” —not much material here for the
dilettante of the school della Crusca ! Brady
spells vigor, and his verse is meat of the strongest
—aye, salt-junk from the harness - cask, seldom
sufficiently cooked ; but, such as he is, he is thrice-
welcome in the decadent days of the over-refined
poets of the minor school.

The creator of “Mr. Dooley,” as most people
interested in books have by this time learnt, is
Peter Dunn, Irish-American managing-editor of
the Chicago Journal. And Mr. Dooley evens
odds by becoming Peter Dunn’s literary creator.
The root of the matter is the quaint commentary
of a Chicago “character,” an Irish saloon-keeper
mixing drinks near the Journal office ; but
Mr. Dunn has grown all the branches. Mr.
Dooley in Peace and War is a little too
American for the universal palate; the coming
book of “Mr. Dooley in the Hearts of his Country-
men ” (he mocks George Washington !) should be
better. There is no denying the advent of a
New Humourist, salted for some time, if not for
eternity. Por tasting, consider Mr. Dooley “ On
Books—
“ They ’re on’y three books in th’ wurruld wort’ read in’,’’
said Mr. Doole.y—“ Shakespeare, th’ Bible, an’ Mike
Ahearp’s Histhry iv Chicago. I have Shakespeare on
thrust, Father Kelly r-reads th’ Bible f’r me, an’ I didn’t
buy Mike Ahearn’s Histhry because I’ve seen more thin
he cud put into it. Books is th’ ruin iv people, specially
novels. Whin I was a young man, th’ parish priest used
to preach again them ; but nobody knowed what he
me uit. At that time Willum Joyce had th’on’y library
in the Sixth Wa-ard. Th’ mayor gave him th’ bound
volumes iv th’ council proceedings, an’ they was a very
handsome set. Th’ on’y books I seen was th’ kind that
has th’ life iv th’ Pope on th’ outside an’ a set iv dominos
on th’inside. They’re good readin’. Nawthin’ cud be
better f’r a man whin he’s tired out afther a day’s wurruk
thin to go to his library an’ take down wan iv th’ gr-reat
wurruks iv lithratchoor an’ play a game iv dominos f’r th’
dhrinks out iv it. Anny other kind iv r-readin’, barrin’
th’ newspapers, which will niver hurt anny onedycated
man, is destructive iv morals.
“ I had it out with Father Kelly, th’ other day, in this
very matther. He was coinin’ up fr’m down town with
an ar-rmful iv books f’r prizes at th’ school. ‘ Have ye
th’Key to Heaven there?,’says I. ‘No,’ says he, ‘ th’
child her that ’ll get. these books don’t need no key. They
go in under th’ turnstile,’ he says, laughin’. ‘ Have ye
th’Lives iv th’ Saints, or th’ Christyan Dooty, or th’
Story iv Saint Rose iv Lima?’ I says. ‘ I have not,’ says
he. ‘I have some good story-books. T'd rather th
kids’d r-read Charles Dickens than anny iv th’ tales iv
thim holy men that was burned in lie or et up be lines.’
be says. ‘ It does no good in these degin’rate days to
prove that th’ best that can come to a man f’r behavin’
himself is to be cooked in apotordi-gisted be aline,’he says.
Ye ’re wrong,’ says I. ‘ Beggin’ ye’er riv’rince’s pardon,
ye ’re wrong,' I says. ‘ What ar-re ye goin to do with
thim young wans ? Ye ’re goin’ to make thim near-sighted
an’ round-shouldered,’ I says. 1 Ye ’re goin’ to have thim
believe that, if they behave thimsiives an’ lead a virchous
life, they 'll marry rich an’ go to Congress. They’ll wake
up some daj', an’ find out that gettin’ money an’ behavin’
ye’ersilf don’t always go together,’I says. ‘ Some iv th’
wickedest men in th’ vvur-ruld have marrid rich,’ I says.
‘Ye’re goin’ to teach thim that a man doesn’t have to
use an axe to get along in th’ wur-ruld. Ye’re goin’ to
teach thim that a la-ad with a cuilin’ black moustache
an’ smokin’ a cigayeet is always a villvan, whin he's more
often a barber w ith a lar-rge family. Life ! ’ says I.
‘.There’s no life in a book. If ye want to show thim what
life is, tell thim to look around thim.’ ”

SURPRISING CURES AFTER YEARS

Bayswater, Sydney, October, 1898.
W. H. Malyox, Esq., Man. Chemist, Ballarat.
Dear Sir,—For years past (about ten), I have been
troubled with “ Acne ” in its worst form, and have sought
advice from the best Australian and London doctors, with
only fair results. A Victorian friend of mine, some four
or five weeks ago, sent me a tin of your “ Ligmolliene,"
and speaking very highly of its wonderful curative powers.
I naturally took same “Cum Grano Solis," and was in-
clined not to use it ; eventually I tried your ointment
with 1 ruly marvellous results, and am now entirely cured ;
and think people who suffer from skin diseases are greatly
indebted to you for your wonderful remedy; I shall
advise all my friends with skin troubles to use same'."
Wishing “ Ligomolliene ” all the success it richly deserves,
Yours faithfully, GEOItGE J. O REGAN.

Doveton-street, Ballarat,
My dear Mr. Malyon,— August 21st, 1898.
With great pleasure I now sit down to record progress
with regard to my old enemy, “ Eczema Capitis,” from
which I suffieted.Jio.twJthstamlma' constant treatment for
some years under the prescription of Professor M‘Call
Anderson and other eminent dermatologists, with only
partial and temporary relief. When I met you I com-
menced somewhat sceptically your ointment Ligmolliehe,
anil after about two months’ treatment I may honestly say
my enemy is defeated, and I am perfectly well. I will only-

ATTENTION, PLEASE!
WHY are the Preparations manufactured by E. HOL-
VV JjAND Hair Specialist, superior to and in greater de-
mand than all other Preparations for promoting the growth
and restoring the color to the Hair ? Because they are the
result of a practical knowledge -20 years’ experience— of all
the Diseases of the Hair, and what is necessary to remove
them. Whereas nearly all other preparations are manufac-
tured by quacks, and are nothing but quack nostrums.
A gentleman in writing says Everywhere I go I hear
people speaking highly of your Preparations for the Hair.

girl would be pleased to see any of her kinsmen
who might chance to strike Tasmania was pub-
lished with enthusiasm by the Daily Mail. Two
days later a Piety family wrote from Maidstone,
Kent, announcing their relationship to the fair—
no, the very dark—apple-packer. A pretty little
incident illustrating the fact that \\ oman is still,
mixed up with apples, and considers her personal
appearance the only thing worth talking about to
I a mixed audience.
Jock M'Sorley's Mare.
Well, his name was not M'Sorley, we have just
adopted that,
But he was a famous publican on early Ballarat.
He was rubicund and cheerful, and he seemed
without a care,
As he drove along
And hummed a song
Behind his creamy mare.
From authenticated history M‘Sorley, it appears,
Had attended every funeral for over twenty years.
Be the party friend or enemy, the weather foul or
fair,
You could bet your purse
Behind the hearse
Was Jock M'Sorley’s mare.
Jock M'Sorley’s mare was ancient, she was
“ rising twenty-two ”
When he swapped her for a bullock to a burly
butcher, who
There is reason for assuming, was entirely un-
aware
Of the length of days
And whims and ways
Of Jock M'Sorley’s mare.
Now the butchers held a picnic every year at
Ballarat,
Which the knights of steel and cleaver got
extremely jolly at ;
And they took their wives and sweethearts to the
annual aJair,
And they made, of course,
A picnic horse
Of Jock M'Sorley’s mare 1
It was rough on Rosinante, with the pace she used
to keep —
Not a danger of her bolting if she d dn’t fall
asleep 1
But she jogged along serenely, and she never
turned a hair;
She was sure and slow—
Extremely so,
Was Jock M'Sorley's mare.
As the picnickers proceeded there was nothing
very wrong,
Till a funeral procession from the country came
akmg;
And you should have seen the mourners and the
undertakers stare
At the consequent
Bewilderment
Of Jock M'Sorley’s mare !
Then she joined in the procession with decorum
and with grace,
All the flogging in creation couldn’t shift her from
her place ;
And the scene was most disgraceful with the oaths
that tilled the air ;
Oh, they beat the world,
The curses hurled
At Jock M'Sorley’s mare !
Well, she followed the procession to the cemetery
gate,
And the starting of that picnic was particularly
late ;
And the mare was never seen again, but Balla-
raters swear
That the butcher-boys
Made saveloys
Of Jock M'Sorley’s mare !
W. T. GOODGE.
Town and Country.
Scene, upon a country roadside,
And a squatter rides along,
Meets the cookies, shearers, whalers,
And a miscellaneous throng,
All the stranger, bush-bred legion.
Yet he nods, and “ Very dry ! ”
Or, “ Good morning ! ” “ Want a man, sir?
And the squatter passes by.
Scene, a crowded city street, and
Time is just about at noon.
On the path, the, crowd is jostling :
“ Hurry up ! ” “ You’ll get there soon ! ”
In the street the traffic’s blocked, ’midst
“ Are yer drunk ? ” and 1 * Can t yer di ive ?
“ Curse yer, git out of the way there !
That’s amidst a city’s hive.

yankee Doodle
IN AMERICA.
The Legend.
IT was in the summer of 1778, Wash-
ington, with his army ever active,
determined to oppose the British
general, Sir Henry Clinton, who, having
evacuated Philadelphia, was retreating
through New Jersey on New York. The
forces met on 28th June at Monmouth.
La Fayette conducted the attack. The
heat was so intense that some refused to
fight, and many fell dead from exposure
to the sun’s rays. Both sides fought
desperately. As the day waned, and the
flagging spirits of La Fayette’s soldiers
were at a low ebb, a strange sight aroused
them. Marching with drum and fife
was an old man, Jeremiah Wynton, and
his son, and grandson. The old father,
with silvery flowing locks, sturdily strode
through the field. The son with ban-
daged head fifing lustily, the youth,
catching the spirit of his grandsire, rolled
out with him the soul-inspiring rattle of
the drum. Father, son, and graiidson
bad aecompanied the troops as volunteers,
and' were ever in the forefront of the
fight. The fierce light of battle was in
their eyes, they knew no fear, and many
a wild cheer arose, as on' that fateful
day Yankee Doodle was heard as never
was heard before or since.

Sydney versus N.S. Wales.
Next week’s vote will go a long way to de-
cide whether Sydney owns New South Wales,
or New South Wales owns Sydney. The
question as to which is the tail and which is
the dog is awaiting settlement. The anti-
Federal movement in N.S.W. is almost
wholly the uprising of Sydney against the
country. When N.S.W. asked the other
provinces, for the fifth time in the last 20
years, to come in and federate, they assented,
despite the fact that N.S.W. had already
gone back on its invitation four times. When
N.S.W. informed them that they were all
politically-infected and politically-accursed
spots in which no clean and respectable
Federal capital could possibjy be allowed to
exist, they took the insult with a better
grace than might have been expected. When
N.S.W. demanded the capital for itself, they
gave way peaceably. The only stipulation
they made was that the Federal City must
not be in Sydney, or within 100 miles of it;
and thereupon the fury of the Sydney land-
lords and dealers and importers rose to fever-
heat. Inside that 100-mile radius there is a
N.S.W. population of about 650,000. Out-
side it there is a N.S.W. population of about
670,000. As the infuriated property-owners
of Sydney put it, the stipulation with re-
gard to the 100-mile radius “deprived
650,000 N.S.W. citizens of the chance of
having the capital among them.” And when
the Sydney property-owners demand that
the capital shall be in their city, and nowhere
else, they insist on depriving about 900,000
N.S.W. citizens of the chance of having the
capital among them. But the 900,000 are
the country people of N.S.W., and in the
eyes of the Sydney plutocrats they are of
absolutely no account.
♦ * * *
There are the best possible reasons why
the Federal Convention should (at the in-
stigation of Premier Turner of Victoria)
have barred all the existing capitals from
being the Federal City. There was also the
best of reasons why the Premiers’ Conference
should have renewed the stipulation. The
Federal Capital will inevitably attract a
large population—probably, in a few years,
a population of from 50,000 to 100, (Mb
That will mean the creation of wealth in the
shape of land values over all the Federal
district to the extent of probably twenty
millions. The Constitution, if the anti-
-1 ederal C. G. Heydon’s legal opinion of
the clause is worth anything, wisely provides
that the capital shall be built in some place
where the Commonwealth can acquire 100
square miles of soil, so that this immense
access of wealth will be the property of the
Australian people. If the capital were
planted in Sydney the land would not be
the property of the Australian people—the
Commonwealth couldn’t buv Sydnev even
if N.S.W. would sell it, So all the extra
millions of values created by the increase of
population would be simply so many millions
added to the wealth of the Sydney land-
holders. The people of N.S.W., as the
largest partners in the Commonwealth will
own about £8,000,000 of the value of the
Federal district. The city landlords, who
would cheerfully see the N.S.W. people
hanged first, ask them to throw this away
and stipulate for a Federal capital where
all the increment will go to the big
earth - monopolists of the metropolis.
And to further persuade them to this
end they lament over the wrong done
to N.S. Wales by the Premiers’ Confer-
ence when it fixed the 100-mile limit, and
thereby “ debarred 670,000 of the people of
N.S. W. from having the capital among them. ”
And about the wrong which they want to
do when they demand that Sydney alone
shall be eligible, and that the rest of the
province shall be declared an infected region
and for ever unfit to possess the Federal city,
and that 900,000 of their own countrymen
shall be debarred from possessing the same,
they say absolutely nothing.
* * * *
The Federal district is to consist of 100
square miles—an area 10 miles long by 10
broad. This will be the property of Aus-
tralia in general. When a large population
gathers upon it, as it inevitably will, this
area, probably worth now from £1 to £3 an
acre, may easily grow to be worth £20,000,000,
of which N.S. W.’s share will be £7,000,000
or £8,000,000. That will be so much
clear profit to N.S. Wales in general—
the profit which the private landlords of
Sydney are hungering after. If the capital
is planted in the centre of the Federal pro-
perty, everything distant over five miles from
the middle of the new city will be on N.S.W.
soil. The advent of a large population will
vastly improve land-values over the border
of the Federal district in N.S.W., and that
increase, though created by the expenditure
of the money of all the provinces, will belong
to N.S.W. exclusively. The construction of
the new city must supply a lot of work to
N.S.W. citizens. They can’t expect to get all
of it, but as the person on the spot the
N.S.W. man must get a large share. The
city which is built with the cash of all
the Commonwealth must furnish employ-
ment to the adjacent N.S.W. agricultur-
ist in growing provisions for it, and the
N.S.W. mines in providing it with fuel,
and the N.S.W. railways in carrying its
various supplies. And the Sydney traders
ask N.S.W. to forego these advantages also,
and to insist that there shall be no Federa-
tion unless the provisions for the new popu-
lation are bought from the Sydney shops,
and the extra demand helps to boost up the
value of agricultural land in the county of
Cumberland, and to urge on the importation
of American and other provender at the
Sydney wharves. Also, the Sydney traders
incidentally ask the N.S.W. country folks to
declare themselves an infected race and quite
unfit to have the Federal capital among them.
If the new capital is anywhere within
reach of the sea either to the north or south,
it will probably, some day, want a nearer
seaport than Sydney and direct railway com-
munication therewith, whereby N.S.W. will
come into possession of another big port at
Jervis Bay or Grafton or elsewhere. This
will be good for N.S.W. in general—it is
good for any State to have three big ports
instead of two—but the Sydney traders
would gladly abolish every port in N.S.W.
in order to drag all trade to their own centre.
Wherever the capital is it will ooen up the
interior of N.S.W. with the money of all
the six provinces, for the only thing which
keeps the interior from opening up is the
want of an adjacent market. With a
sufficiently good market at hand it
would pay to irrigate the worst
desert in Cornstalk Land and make it
blossom like the rose. The theoretical
desire to open up the interior is on the lips
of every Sydney patriot, but when the
chance presents itself the only place he
really wants to open up is George-street,
with a bit of Pitt-street and King-street and
Circular Quay, and he asks the man who
battles in the lone wilderness Out Back, and
hardly ever sees a city or a gleam of civilisa-
tion, to vote down the union which will'
bring a new city and a civilisation to his
door. Also he is asked to rise up and object
to the coming customers, and to tell them
that the only price at which he will federate
is that they don’t come but make for Sydney
instead. Likewise he is requested to state
that he doesn’t want a job at helping to
build the Federal capital ; and that he is
scared lest its proximity increases the value
of his dry, bear-haunted selection and the
proceeds lead him astray ; and that in any
case he loathes the idea of a capital built on
land-nationalisation principles and can’t die
happy under his hot galvanised iron roof
unless the Sydney landlord gets the profits.
* * * *
He is invited to say all these things on the
20th, but he won’t. And it will be a good
thing for the masses in Sydney, and a good
thing for all N.S.W., if he doesn’t. If the
Federal capital were planted in Sydney the
increase of population would be a good
thing for the Sydney city shopkeepers and
the importers ; but then only a few people
have the luck to be city shopkeepers and
importers. It would raise the value of land
and consequently it would raise rents, but
few people own land, and most people pay
rents. And if the capital isn’t at Sydney
that city really loses nothing. It doesn’t
lose the Federal capital, for no place can
lose what it never had. The man doesn’t
lose threepence of his own when he only
misses the chance to steal somebody else’s
threepence. And for N.S.W. in general
there will be a new 7 city to seek work in,
and to build railways to, and to grow food
for. Its existence will make it possible and
profitable to build lines and make roads
where otherwise they wouldn’t pay for
six generations. It will bring a new mar-
ket to the door of the out-back agriculturist
—not to the Sydney importer or middleman.
It will create a haven of refuge in the howl-
ing solitudes, and a streak of civilisation
and a place where the long, cool beer is only
threepence, in a region where all these
things are much lacking. It will confer the
blessings of literature and the drama and the
variety leg-show on a country that lias long
pined for them in vain. It will move the
curse of loneliness and emptiness a long
stage further back, and shift the dog-leg
fence another degree towards the sunset; it
will make irrigation possible where now
there is only drought, and substitute live
people for the dead agriculturists who walk
about not knowing they are dead, and create
cathedrals and public libraries where the
gum-tree and the ant-heap are now, and
make great newspapers where the chief
knowledge of passing events is based on what
Bill heard at the roadside pub. And it will
open the way for the grandest experiment in
land nationalisation the world can show, if
0. G. Heydon’s legal opinion as to the mean-
ing of clause 125 is worth anything—the
capital of a great continent owned by the
people instead of by the land-grabber, and
the boomster, and the jerry-builder—a
model city rising in the wilderness of empti-
ness and great spaces and loony bullocks. If
anyone knows of any other way by which a
town of 50,000 or 100,000 people is likely to
be created in the interior of Australia any
time within the next hundred years—well,
Australia is waiting to hear from him.
♦ * * *
And the people of N.S.W. are requested
to burn down this coming metropolis next
week, because it will cost the Telegraph
£5OOO a year to wire its Parliamentary re-
ports to its office in King-street, Sydney, if
the Federal Parliament is located anywhere
beyond a tram-ride of its premises. Also,
because the Sydney property-owners want to
sell allotments at three times their value to
build the new Houses of Parliament on, and
to let their empty tenements to the Federal
State officials, and make a land-boom and
charge higher rents; and because the
Sydney traders want to sell food and drink
and boots to the new population. Therefore
the Telegraph and MacLagrin and G.
Dibbs —the long man who looks like an
unreliable report balanced on its end—rave
exceedingly. And next Tuesday N.S.W. is
cordially invited by these patriots to cut its
throat in their private quarrel, and be proud
to offer up its severed jugular in their
interests.
The Blessings of the Blot.
Now that the Referendum is at hand, the anti-
Federal party has settled down to concentrate its
best lying power on two principal points—the
equal State representation in the Federal Senate,
and the awful effects of the Braddon “Blot.”
The average person never seriously studies the
Bill, but gathers his impressions from scraps of
oratory, and bits of half-remembered conversations,
and vague recollections about something he
thought he saw in a newspaper; and the average
person has a bad memory, and mixes up these
hazy recollections with cricket and football items.
Therefore, even at this late hour, there are plenty
of people who give credit to the tremendous lying
of the Telegraph, and fancy that the Braddon
clause is a scheme whereby the Federal Govern-
ment is pledged to raise £4 in customs revenue
when only £1 is wanted, and to drink itself into a
lunatic asylum with the other £3. So it is worth
while to state the whole case for the Blot over
again, and (what the Telegraph and the other
anti-Federal perjurers never do) to give chapter
and verse from the Bill and from official publica-
tions for every statement; so that the public can
verify the assertions for themselves.
* * * *
The Blot itself is contained in clause 87 of the
amended Bill —the one which any elector can
obtain gratis on application at a post-office—and
reads thiis:
During a period of ten years after the establishment
of the Commonwealth, and thereafter until the Parlia-
ment otherwise provides, of the net revenue of the Com-
monwealth from duties of customs and excise not more
than one-fourth shall be applied annually by the Com-
monwealth towards its expenditure.
Tlie balance shall, in accordance with this constitution,
be paid to the several States, or applied towards the pay-
ment of interest on debts of the several States taken over
by the Commonwealth.
» * * *
The Bulletin urges the public not to
listen to the bald assertions of the Tele-
graph (which has £5OOO a year to save by pro-
curing the defeat of any Federation Bill 'which
doesn’t fix the capital in Sydney), or Dr. Mac-
XiAURiN, of the Colonial Sugar Refining Co. (whose
cheap nigger-grown Fijian sugar will almost cer-
tainly be shut out under Federation in favor or
an Australian product grown by white men); but
to read the above clause carefully 18 times, and
then see for themselves if the following statements
are, or are not, exactly true :
(1) The clause does not fix any tariff, large, small, or
medium, all the Sydney Sunday rag's yells about the
“Braddon Blot Tariff” notwithstanding. It says that
the Federal Government is to have one-fourth and the
State Governments three-fourths of the customs and
excise revenue, but it doesn’t say whether that revenue is
to be £1 a year for all Australia, or 2s. 6d., or £9,000,000.
It leaves the question of high or low tariff absolutely
open.
(2) It doesn't even indirectly commit the Federal
Government to a high tariff. It doesn’t say that the
Federal Government is to pay all its expenses out of the
one-fourth of customs and excise allotted to it, and there-
fore when it wants 1:250,000 for itself it needn’t raise a
million and hand £750,000 back to the States. The
Federal Government may raise what money it wants, if it
feels so inclined, by land-tax, income-tax, probate-duties,
stamp-duties, totalisator-tax, poll-tax, dividend-tax, or in
any other way, and the whole of the money raised from
these sources goes to the Federal Treasury.
(3) The Freetrade party proposes, of course, to de-
mand that there shall be no customs or excise and that
the Federal Government shall raise all its revenue by
direct taxation. A clause which says that the customs
and excise revenue (if there is any) is to be applied in a
certain fashion can’t hamper the party which, if it gets
into power, isn’t going to have any customs and excise.
The fact that the Federal Government must give up
three-fourths of its tariff receipts to the States doesn’t
matter to a party which, if it gets into power, is going to
give up the whole of the tariff receipts in any case. The
situation is just the same as if the law said that three-
fourths of all money stolen must be given to the Church.
The honest man would reply that, as he never stole any
money, the clause didn’t affect him.
* * * »
This is the situation while the refund provision
exists. But the period of its existence is strictly
limited. In fact, it is limited in three different
ways:
(1) The refund to the States stops as soon as the
Commonwealth makes arrangements for taking over the
State debts. Then the Commonwealth retains the three-
fourths of the tariff revenue (if there is any) to help pay
interest with. This provision may abolish the whole
refund business within a year.
(2) If the Commonwealth doesn’t take over the State
debts (though it is almost sure to do so), and doesn’t
make the clause of no account by going in for Freetrade
and thus having no tariff revenue to divide, still the
Braddon clause may be abolished at any time by the
ordinary process of amending the Constitution. The
Constitution may be amended (clause 128) by the consent
of one House of the Federal Parliament, and the assent
of a bare majority of the people voting and a bare
majority of the States. The Braddon clause says that the
arrangement shall last ten years, but that statement can
be amended out of the Constitution like any other
statement.
(3) After ten years the Braddon clause can be struck
out by Parliament without going through the process of
amending the Constitution ; when the ten years is up it
merely remains in the Constitution “ until Parliament
otherwise provides.” If the small and allegedly “ neces-
sitous ” States persuade the Senate to object to its aboli-
tion it can be abolished at a Joint Sitting of the two
Federal Houses at which Joint Sitting N.S.W. and Vic-
toria can command a big majority.
**‘ * *
The Braddon clause is, therefore, an exceed-
ingly temporary concern at the best. Still, it is
almost certain to be in force for a little while, and
it is interesting to consider the allegedly awful
results that may rise while it lasts. At present,
the six provinces (Queensland, N.S.W., Victoria,
Tasmania, Westralia, and S.A.) raise nearly
=£7,000,000 a year in customs and excise revenue,
and the interest alone (exclusive of other heavy
charges for redemption, &c.) on their public debts,
is over =£7,000,000. Therefore every one of them
is dependent on its customs and excise revenue to
pay its interest bill and keep it out of bankruptcy.
The exact figures, taken from Coghlan’s “ Statis-
tics of the Seven Colonies of Australasia ” for
1897-98 (tables 48 and 55) are these :
Customs and Interest on
Excise. Debt.
N.S. Wales £1,529,830 ... £2,298,974
S. Australia 607,226 ... 953,119
Queensland 1,323,094 ... 1,274,244
Tasmania 371,215 ... 318,731
Victoria 2,110,866 ... 1,842,976
Westralia 1,017,724 ... 325,994
£6,959,955 £7,014,038
The Constitution does not definitely hand over the
State debts to the Commonwealth. If it had
done so, the State creditors would have got the
benefit of the better security of the Common-
wealth gratis —would have still received the rate
of interest they bargained for while getting
much better security than they bargained for. By
making the transfer optional, the Common wealth
can say to the holders of the .£1,000,000 of 6
per cent, stock, and the £2,500,000 of 5 per cent,
securities, and the £5,000,000 of per cents., and
the £9(5,000,000 of 4 per cents. : “If you are pre-
pared to accept 3 per cent, stocks in exchange for
your present holdings you can have the vastly im-
proved security of the Commonwealth ; if not,
you must do without it, ” whereas, by making the
transfer absolute and compulsory, these creditors
would have got the extra security and still received
their exorbitant 4 and 6 and 6 per cent. There-
fore, for purposes of economy, the -transfer of the
State debts to the Commonwealth was not made
compulsory.
* * * *
And this opened up a new danger, to meet
which the Braddon clause was devised. For the
Commonwealth might not take over the State
debts, or it might not do so for years. And in the
meantime each State would have handed over to
the Commonwealth the customs and excise on
which it wholly relied to meet its interest bill,
and would still be responsible for the interest bill.
And the Federal Government, it was feared,
might raise, say, £6,000,000 a year in customs and
excise, and though it needed less than £1,000,000,
might “blew ” the whole lot in riotous living and
leave the States utterly bankrupt, every one. Of
course the country would make an end of such a
Government at next election, but every State
might have gone broke before next election. Any-
how, if the Commonwealth started under a law
which made the States solely responsible for their
debts, yet deliberately empowered the Federal Par-
liament (which wasn’t responsible for the debts) to
deprive them of all means to pay their interest, it
would be formally authorising repudiation.
* * * *
The Braddon clause doesn’t definitely provide
the States with sufficient money to pay their
interest bills. - But it at least provides that the
Federal Government shall not raise £6,000,000 a
year by the handy customs and excise expedient
and spend the whole of it in riotous living at the.
Federal capital. It prevents the other provinces
snatching at N.S.W.’s alleged surplus, by provid-
ing that N.S.W. shall get back its own surplus.
It offers a certain guarantee to the public creditor.
And if there had been no Blot the Bill would have
provided :
(1) That the States, which had borrowed £190,000,000,
woutd hand over to the Federal Government the only
fund out of which they have hitherto been able to pay
interest on this sum, without making any stipulation
that the interest would he provided for.
(2) That the Federal Government, which only wants
about £750,000 for its own expenditure, could raise
£7,000,000, or any other large sum, by customs and excise,
and spend it all in riot and dissipation, with no obligation


whatever to provide for paying interest on the public
the other provinces could grab N.S.W.’s sur-
plus, or anybody’s surplus, if they could get it.
The Blot was put in as a plain statement that
Australia intended to pay its interest bill honestly,
and that no province meant to rob another pro-
vince. Its duration was limited, not because Aus-
tralia meant to leave off being honest, but because
there is always a possibility of some day improving
the mechanism of the arrangement. The anti-
Bederalists of N.S.W., who demand that the
good old Blot shall be struck out, ask that there
be no provision for paying interest on the public
debt, and that the other provinces shall not pro-
mise to hand back N.S.W. its surplus honestly and
fairly. And, if there were no Blot, these same
people would preach furiously that the want of a
Blot made Federation utterly impossible, _ and
showed that the motives of the other provinces
were unspeakably bad and sinister.
* • • *
If Australia means to pay the interest on its
public debt honestly, then the Blot makes no
difference. Australia, as a whole, is working
under the Braddon clause now, only in a more
aggravated form: instead of setting aside three-
fourths of its customs and excise revenue to pay
interest on its debt, it sets aside the whole of it and
£50,000 more. Every separate province, except
Westralia, is working under the Braddon clause
without knowing if —particularly N.S.W., which,
instead of setting aside three-fourths of its customs
and excise to pay interest with, as required by the
Blot, sets aside all of it and £700,000 more.
N.S.W. has been working under the Braddon
clause without knowing it ever since 188 G.
Even if the Commonwealth Government heaped
up its tariff to 48s. per head per annum, every pro-
vince, bar W.A., would still have to work under
the Braddon clause —or else give up pay-
ing interest on its debt. And if the Braddon
clause is thrown out of the Constitution 1300
times, Australia will still go on working under it—
unless it repudiates its debts, The one reason
why Australia will set aside three-fourths of its
customs and excise revenue to pay interest with is,
not that the Braddon clause says so, but that it
takes more than three-fourths of the biggest tariff
revenue any Treasurer is ever likely to get out of
Australia to pay the interest.
<* * * *
The customary anti-Biot argument is that,
under this famous clause, “ the Federal Govern-
ment must raise four times the tariff revenue it
requires.” Which is half the truth. The whole
truth is that the Braddon clause will compel it
to raise four times the tariff revenue which it
WOULD REQUIRE IP IT.STOPPED PAYING INTEREST ON
the public debt. And that isn’t nearly so bad as
the fact that N.S.W. is now compelled to raise
several million times the tariff revenue which it
would require if it didn’t pay interest on its public
debt.
* • * *
The Bulletin isn’t apologising for the Braddon
clause ; that requires no apology. Nobody apolo-
gises for his virtues, as a rule, or asks people to
try to put up with his good qualities till he can
get rid of them. This paper simply asks N.S.W.
to rise as one man on the 20th of June and vote
for the Federal Constitution because, among its
other good qualities, the Braddon clause is in it.
It asks them to have sufficient sense to recognise
a good clause when they see it, and to act accord-
ingly. And it proposes three cheers for the good,
honest, far-seeing, sagacious Blot and for its
author.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Nigger Apparition.
Sydney Telegraph invented a great nigger lie
and apparition in its issue of Bth June, as still
another reason why Australia should not
federate. It was a convulsion in six fits, and
the respective fits were as follows :
Fit 1: The Commonwealth Bill provides (clause 51,
section 26) that the Federal Parliament shall have power
to make laws dealing- with “ the people of any race, other
than the aboriginal race in any State, for whom it is
deemed necessary to make special laws.” (Aboriginals,
being regarded as ordinary citizens, are left under the
control of the States.) This gives the Commonwealth
absolute power to exclude all niggers, Chinamen and
other aliens. The Telegraph says the object of the
clause is obviously to admit niggers and form a nigger
province in the Northern Territory. If the framers of the
Constitution had wanted to admit niggers, the easy way
to do it would have been by giving no power of exclusion
and just letting the niggers come. In the frantic lexicon
of the D.T., the fact that they gave to the Commonwealth
special powers to exclude niggers shows that they don’t
want to exclude niggers !
Convulsion No. 2 : The Telegraph says that B. R.
Wise is supposed to be, and that ex-Govt. Resident
, Northern Territory is, in favor of a nigger

im Snasm there is no mention of any such thing
in the Bill, the Telegraph says that the people will cer-
tainly create a Federal Government which will at once
spend £3,000,000 in building a new I \ ar^ o ‘. at a j] e b I< ?® ’
Queensland, Victoria, Tasmania, and W.A., all bom
anxious to stand their share of the damage in ordc. to
drag trade away from their own ports, and make Adelaide
a therefore, vessels will come from England,
not to Perth, Albany, Adelaide, Melbourne, Sydney and
Newcastle, where all the population is, and where they
can land their goods and take in new cargo and passen-
gers right alongside big cities, but to lonesome, solitary
Port Darwin. And there the goods will be put ashore
on the sand and humped on to the trucks ° f trans-
continental railway and sent by rail about 2400 miles
at a cost of not less than £b per ton(£d. per ton per
mile), which will make the freight from Europe about £7
in place of £2 per ton as at present. And through the
insistance of the other provinces in blewing their money
on building the trans-continental railway and the new
harbor, and the insane resolve of every steamer to go to
Port Darwin and send all its freight by rail across the
whole continent, and get its coal sent back to it the same
wav at a cost of about £6 a ton, therefore all the trade
will go to Adelaide, being humped there overland, and
Sydney will be ruined. But somehow Melbourne won t
be ruined.
Also, it is explained that for some wonderful
reason or other “all investments in N.S.W.
mines will absolutely and entirely cease for
many years to come.” The Telegraph doesn’t
say how it learned that all these things are to
be—it just states on the authority of its own
insane penn’orth that they will be, if N.S.W.
accepts the Bill on the 20th. In its own mind,
or home for incurable delusions, it sees, as one
looking darkly through a bottle, that the white
people of Australia, having one-man one-vote,
will inevitably elect a Federal Parliament
which will start nigger importation on a huge
scale, and build the new Adelaide harbor and
the trans-continental railway. And thereafter
it knows by instinct that ships will give up
coming to Sydney and Melbourne and Ade-
laide (where there are 3,000,000 people to trade
with), and insist on going to the Northern
Territory (where there are 4898 people scat-
tered over an area larger than N.S.W., Vic-
toria, and Tasmania all put together), and all
our goods will come down by rail just as all
N.S.W.’s imports are landed now in the Gulf
of Carpentaria, and brought down by go-cart
and gradual perambulator. Which is a Terrible
Outlook.
♦
The Anti-Billious Bill.
Ninety-nine per cent, or more of the N.S.W.
people who are not too tired or too intoxicated
to say something about Federation assert that
they believe in Australian union with all their
heart and soul. Of the remaining fraction
about one-hundredth part says it is against any
kind of union. The other 99 parts refuse to
say anything because if they allowed their
attention to be distracted they would lose their
hold of the lamp-post, and if they lost their
hold of the lamp-post they would fall down.
Every man and newspaper who orates on the
anti-Federal side, and hollers for disunion,
swears with tremendous force that he believes
in union, and yearns after union, and would
even sacrifice his mother-in-law to bring it
about. Only he is against this Bill and wants
to see it thrown out so that a better one may
take its place. Therefore N.S.W. runs up
against these three alternatives :
(1) It may take'this Bill.
(2) It may wait for the better Bill that is always
promised and which is never forthcoming.
(3) It may do with no Bill at all.
Considering that there are only about two men
(and one of them is George Pile’s dog) in all
N.S.W. who say they are wholly against
union the latter alternative may be dropped.
It becomes a question of taking this Bill, or
waiting for the better anti-Billious Bill which
is never shown to the public. Neither Dibbs,
nor the Heydons, nor Pilcher, nor the Tele-
graph, nor the Sabbath Shellback, nor the
howling destructionist Norton, nor the
Colonists anti-Bill League, nor J. Want has
ever drafted or published that better Bill
which they all say they are ready to work for
as soon as the present one is defeated. The
Bulletin, two years ago (on 23rd January,
1897), before even the Convention met, pub-
lished its idea of a Draft Federal Constitution
in full, and it has defended it ever since. The
Federal party has issued its Bill, which is
now before the country. And the anti-
Billious party—the Telegraph, Sabbath tip-
ster, Dibbs, Heydon, Pilcher, Want, Mac-
Laurin, “Brolly” Hughes, and the rest—
address the country thus :
If you reject this Bill we will help you to get a better
one. We refuse to show you the better one ; you must
take our word for it that there will be a better one. We
are the benevolent confidence-men of N.S.W., and you
must exhibit your confidence in us by throwing away
this Bill first. Please drop the bone, and you have our
unsupported assurance that the shadow will be forth-
coming later on. We say that we know how to draft a
Federal scheme which will be acceptable all round, but
we never do it—not in public, anyhow. We say that
every man of sense knows how the financial clauses, and
those dealing with representation in the Senate, and all
the other disputed matters, ought to read, but we never
publish these clauses as they ought t.o be, so that the
public can see how beautiful and simple they are.
On the 20th you have to vote either to accept
the Bill you see or to wait for the alleged
future Bill that you don’t see. Please vote for
the Bill that you don’t see. We don’t produce our
improved Bill—not because we haven’t one -but solely
because it is so perfect and so beautiful that the
sight of it would break you all up. The other side has
produced its Bill, and we say with much blast ami curse
that it is bad. No two of us agree as to the exact nature
of its badness, but it is bad. And if you will kindly throw
it away before seeing our greatly improved Bill, we beg
to assure you that when you do see our greatly improved
Bill you will be astonished. As a matter of fact, you will
never see it, and there isn’t any, and if yon did see it
before the Referendum you would set us down as lunatics
and never listen to anything we say again. The other
party consists of the people who do things. We
are the people who stand round and say that we
can do the things a great deal better, and are
going to do them a great deal better some day.
The fact that not one of us has ever done anything to
improve the N.S.W. Constitution proves that we know
exactly how to make a perfect Constitution. Please
empty out the present water (which we say is dirty)
before you get a cleaner sample. If we showed you the
Bill that we are prepared to fight for, then you could
decide on the 20th whether it was better to pin your
faith to Barton’s Bill, or to wait on the chance of getting
ours, or to give up the idea of union altogether. But we
haven’t sufficient faith in any Bill we could construct to
let you see it. Also if Norton and Dibbs and Heydon
and Tommy Dodd ever got together in one room to con-
struct anything, the furniture would all be smashed and
somebody’s hair and ear would presently be fired out of
the window. Amen 1

The Blind calling’ to the Blind.
A few casual gems dug out from the speeches
of some anti-Federal leaders within the last
few days :
There is nothing to prevent every Federal Minister, ex-
cept, possibly, the Premier, from being a member of the
Federal Senate. — A. B. Piddington.
Of the Federal Executive probably three out of seven
v\ in sit in the Senate.— “Brolly” Hughes.
Does anyone really think that senatorial grandees,
elected by a whole colony as one constituency—men of
Cabinet rank and wide public repute such as will sit in
the Senate— will brook exclusion frotn the Federal
Cabinet ?— A. B. Piddington.
Only very rich men will be able to secure seats in the
Senate.— Labor-member Holman.
As the whole colony was to be treated as one electorate
(at senatorial elections), the effect might be that the most
able and brilliant men in the colony would be rejected.—
Tom Slattery.
There are three necessitous States that cannot keep
their heads above water. — Pilcher , of N.S. W. Leg-iron
Council.
Yesterday it was stated that those who oppose the Bill
will persist in speaking of the other States as insolvent.
This is a mis-statement.—Daily Telegraph, 6th June.
Victoria, S.A., and Tasmania were iu a retrograde
state. — L. F. Heydon, M.L.C.
The other States were the needy States.— Blanksby,
M.L.C.
The United States Constitution has produced a cen-
tralised form of Government.— Daily Telegraph, 6th
June.
In the decision of vital interests it leaves the people at
THE MERCY OF SMALL LOG-ROLLING STATE COMMUNITIES.—
Same paper, same date, and immediately after the state-
ment that it is the Central Government which runs the
show.
This Bill is a Chinese copy of the United States Consti-
tution. — G. Republican Dibbs.
There is not another such Bill on the face of the earth
(i.e., it isn’t a copy of anything).— Tom Slattery.
The Bill was a copy of the oldest and most discreditable
model —that of America.— L. F. Heydon, M.L.C.
The extra cost to N.S.W. will be 225. 6d. per head per
annum.— Daily Telegraph and Dr. MacLaurin.
It would mean 3s. 6d. or 3s. 7d. per head of the popula-
tion. He had nine persons in his family. That meant
that he would have to pay £1 11s. 6d. more taxation. —
Dacey, M.L.A.
The Federal tariff will be equal to at least 15 per cent,
on all imports.— Dr. MacLaurin, M.L.C.
An average tariff of 34 per cent, will be necessary.—
W. J. Lyne, M.L.A.
Under the Braddon Blot, as they all knew, the Federal
Treasurer would have to raise four times as much as he
wanted. Three-fourths would have to be returned to the
contributing States. — Pilcher, M.L.C.
The people of N.S.W. would never get back any of the
surplus revenue raised by the Federal Treasurer. —
Higgins.
Altogether the blind and the one-eyed seem to
be a good deal tangled up in the muddled camp
of Anti-Bill.
Lyne’s New Ghost.
Even at this late hour the Sydney anti-Federal
party, per medium of dull Bill Lyne, has con-
trived to invent a new bogey—this at a time
when it looked as if every possible lie was used
up. Says William John (S.M. Herald re-
port, Bth June) :
Notwithstanding: the fact that it had been calculated
that bv 1921 the population of N.S.W. would have
doubled, it would only be entitled to be represented by
two more members in the Lower House. This was
another example of the manner in which the Bill pro-
vided for minority rule.
BiIIJjYNE is hereby warned that even though
the population of N.S.W. has trebled by 1921,
it may not be entitled to any more representa-
tion at all—and even then minority rule will
have nothing to do with it. What the Bill
says is that the House of Representatives shall,
unless the law is altered some day, be, as
nearly as possible, twice as numerous as the
Senate, and
The number of members chosen in the respective States
shall be in proportion to the respective numbers of
their people. —Clause 3U.
Therefore, while the population of N.S.W. is
1,330,000 and that of the Commonwealth
3,700,000, as at present, N.S.W. will have 25
members. And if the population of N.S.W.
doubles by 1921, while that of the other pro-
vinces remains exactly stationary, then N.S.W.
will have 36 members, and the other provinces
will have fewer than they have now. But if
the other provinces are so beastly inconsiderate
as to double their population also, then N.S. W.
will still have 25 members as before—in fact,
the provinces will all remain as before. And
if N.S. W. doubles its population and the other
provinces treble theirs—well, the chances are
that N.S. W. will only have 16 members. And
yet there will be no minority representation
about it. Poor old William John’s idea is
that N.S.W. is the only province that can pos-
sibly increase in population. Or else that,
when there are 72 members to divide among
the States, and N.S.W. is entitled to 25 now
while the other provinces are entitled to 47,
therefore when N.S.W. doubles its population
it should have 50 members. And, even though
the other provinces also double their popula-
tion, they should be content with the other 22
members among them.
.+
The 12| per Cent. MacLaurin Tariff.
The unhappy MacLaurin, who was a
member of the Dibbs Govt, which put on the
one heavy tariff in N.S.W. history, and who
goes round using terrible language about heavy
tariffs, is driven to great straits to explain
himself. One very cheering assertion is this,
in a recent letter to the press :
I calculated that, if N.S.W. gave her surplus to the
other colonies, an ad valorem of about 15 per cent, on all
over-sea imports, taxable and uritaxable, would suffice.
This calculation included Queensland, whose require-
ments have to be provided for, and which now raises duties
on all merchandise, including intercolonial goods, equiva-
lent to an ad valorem of 16.72 per cent.
The Dibbs duties, I may add, only represented an ad
valorem of 9'77 per cent, during the four years they were
in force. The highest year was 1894, when they were
equivalent to 10'68 per cent. So that you will see the
Dibbs duties were much lower than the Federal tariff
would be under the most favorable circumstances, should
the present Bill be accepted.
In reply, The Bulletin begs to present the
miserably inaccurate doctor with these facts
about his own Ministry’s tariff. The highest
gross taxation was in 1892. In that year the
Dibbs customs tariff produced £2,593,839
neb (“ Coghlan’s Statistics ” for 1897,
page 812). The imports that year were
£20,776,526 (same volume, page 126). That
was over 12£ per cent, on imports not
about 10J per cent., as the doctor alleges.
In 1894 the imports were £15,801,941, and the
import duties £2,015,695 —also over 12J per
cent. In other words, the N.S.W. Govt,
charged almost as much on foreign and inter-
provincial imports as Dr. MacLaurin says the
Federal Govt, will have to charge on foreign
imports alone. And yet these were years of
cheapness, when prices were lower than they
had been for many previous years. And Dr.
M‘L.’s 12J per cent, all-round tariff brought
about none of the horrors which, he says, a 15
per cent, tariff on foreign imports only must
create. And Dr. MacLaurin’s gruesome appa-
rition of ruin didn’t stalk the earth, and none
of the dreadful things which he says must
happen showed any signs of happening. In
fact, barring an imaginary girl who wrote to
Sydney Telegraph, saying that her sick
brother’s cod-liver oil had gone up, there were
no complaints that this paper remembers.
♦
Some More Precedents.
Considering all the jeremiads about the inevit-
able awful results to everybody and the
destruction of everything if the Australian
Commonwealth is built on any principle save
that of representation in Lhe Senate according
to population, the following is worth noting.
Among all the Federations in this world there
is not one which has representation in its Upper
House according to population. There isn’t
even one which has proposed such a thing.
Some examples of how the discrepancy works
are as follows :
Australia: N.S.W. (1,346,000 people), W.A. (168,000),
each 6 senators ; W.A. has eight times its mathematical
proportion.
Canada : Ontario (2,114,000), 24 senators ; Prince Ed-
ward Island (109,000), 4 senators; P.E. Island has 3J
times its correct proportion.
Germany : Prussia (31,800,000), 17 senators ; Schaum-
burg-Lippe (41,000), 1 senator ; Schaumburg-Lippe has 45
times its correct representation.
Switzerland : Zurich (351,000), 2 senators; Uri (17,000),
2 senators; Uri has over 20 times its exact share of repre-
sentation.
United States: New York (6,000,000), 2 senators;
Nevada (46,000), 2 senators ; Nevada has 130 times its
fair share of representation as compared with New York.
Mexico : Jalisco (1,107,000), 2 senators ; Campeche
(88,000), 2 senators. CampSche has times its fair
share as compared with Jalisco.
Brazil: Minas Geraes (3,184,000), 3 senators ; Matto
Grosso (93,000), 3 senators ; latter has 34 times the- re-
presentation per head of Minas Geraes.
This list is too long to be given in full. But
every Federation not included above is built on
the principle of equal State representation in
the Senate. And if there is any Federation
wherein the principle has been found to be a
failure, or where any party has tried to sup-
press it, or where there is any demand for its
suppression, the address thereof isn’t known in
Australia. The men who built all these States
travelled on the idea that it was to the interest
of the country as a whole to make special
efforts to develope the empty and neglected
parts of its territory, and that representation
strictly according to population meant sacrific-
ing the country at large for the benefit of a
few overwhelming cities. They believed in
leaving some of the grease for the lean hog,
and they all, barring property-vote and Tory-
ruled Canada, carried the process much further
thau it is proposed to do in Australia. And
now, at this latter end of the 19th century,
George Pile’s dog rises to say that he knows
a great deal more than George Washington
ever did about building a Constitution ; and
Porfirio Diaz is requested to stand by and
gather wisdom from Tommy Dodd; and the
Swiss republic, after braving the storms of five
centuries, and being held up as the brightest
example in modern history of a free and demo-
cratic nation, learns from G. Republican Dibbs
that it has been wrong from the beginning.
And even “ Old To-morrow,” who raised up
the only federated community in the British
empire, hears in his grave that he was an ass
after all, and that if he had only asked C. G.
Heydon the latter could have shown him the-
right way to do it in ah instant.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now ’urry, Mrs. New South Wales, and come
along of us,
We’re all a-goin’ ridin’ in the Federation ’bus.
A fam’ly party, don’t you know—yes, Queens-
land’s cornin’, too.
You can’t afford it! Go along ! We’ve kep’ box-
seat for you.
The very one of all the lot that can afford it best,
You’ll only have to pay your share the same as all
the rest. >
You say your sons is workin’ men, and can’t afford
to ride!
Well, all our sons is workin’ men, a-smokin’ up
outside.
You think you might be drove to smash by some
unskilful bloke!
Well, ain’t we all got necks ourselves ? And we
don’t want ’em broke.
You bet your life we’re not such fools but what
we’ll do our best
To keep from harm—for harm to one is harm to
all the rest.
Now, don’t go trudgin’ on alone, but get aboard
the trap;
That basket, labelled “ Capital,” you take it in
your lap!
It’s nearly time we made a start, so let’s ’ave no
more talk ;
You ’urry up and get aboard, or else stop out and
walk.
We’ve got a flag; we’ve got a band; our ’orses
travels fast;
Ho ! Right away, Bill! Let ’em go ! The old ’un’s
come at last 1
THE BANJO.
Good Lord, Deliver Us!
Oh ! save this suffering country from the anti-
Federal blare,
With stalwart arm protect us from the turmoil in
the air,
Anri scatter the parochial mob whose moaning
blatherskite
Runs riot through the country seeking victims left
and right;
Let the Federal Referendum
To the lowest Hades send ’em
Where old Vulcan still is toiling and the fire burns
ever bright.
Oh ! spare Thy cornstalk folks the Sabbath
Dingo’s awful cry ;
And spare them just a little space the daily inky
lie.
Where the Daily Penny Crammer holds forth
from “witness-box,”
And strives to blind its jury with par. and para-
dox ;
Soon the Federal Referendum
Will duly recommend ’em
To surrender at discretion when their ship is on
the rocks.
Oh ! save us from the ghosts that gibber in their
mental fog,
Let Dibbs’s big cigar go out, and please slay G.
Pile’s dog.
Just gag the agitators who speak of “Braddon
Blot,”
And dub our fatted Premier the new Iscariot;
For the Federal Referendum
Doth mightily offend ’em
Because George went “nap” for Sydney, and
failed to get the lot.
Oh! save the civil servants from the threatened
Federal “sack,”
Just tell our Labor members that their screws
they will not lack ;
They who think, like poor Othello, that their
occupation’s lost
And dream of pick and shovel, by cruel tyrant
bossed,
Let the Federal Referendum
A crumb of comfort send ’em,
And prove that all such visions are unreal as any
ghost.

Criterion " The Flesh and the Devil."
Lyceum “ A Soldier and a Man.”
Palace M'Adoo s Georgia Minstrels.
Opera House “ The Guv’nor.”

MELBOURNE SHOWS FOR COMING WEEK.

Theatre Royal “ How London Lives.”
Bijou Rickards' Variety Co.
Suburban Tour Dante the Great.
Nothing now has happened in the Sydney
show business this week. 11 very theatre is
mumbling the dusty tail-end of a programme that
is about as old as the tale of Lot’s wife. But
on the coming Saturday Harry Conor’s new
American co. appears at Her Majesty’s in a
musical frivolity called “A Stranger in New
York.” Also, the “Liars” cease from lying at
the Royal, and the prevaricators are at rest.
Pinero’s “ Trelawny of the Wells ” takes the place
of these inaccurate people, who, with the kindly
purpose, of helping a tottering sister out of the
mud of disrepute, told the thing that wasn’t there,
and took a baseless and incompetent affidavit.
The same night the “Three Musketeers”leave off
at the Criterion to make room for Sardou’s “Flesh
and the Devil. ” There is a very reasonable amount
of flesh in the present production—the white,
smooth flesh of Milady when a great part of her
dress comes off in the struggle with d’Artagnan
and the brand on her shoulder is revealed ; and if
there is more flesh in the next one, and the quality
keeps up, this paper looks forward to it with
hope.
• * * *
At this late hour The Bulletin has an
idea for improving Bernard Fspinasse’s fine ver-
sion of the “ Three Musketeers. ” There is a sort
of boom in the “Musketeers” just now, and by-
and-bye, in the slow process of time, it will spread
out into the bakblox, where they like their tragedy
thick and gruesome and slab. So if this scribe
were Mr. Espinasse he would add another pro-
logue for the special benefit of the man far out.
The present prologue goes back beyond the con-
fines of Dumas’ story to the marriage of Athos
and the lady with ithe brand on her shoulder,
but what the bush audience would like would
be to go away to the remote beginning
and see the branding of the lady. It
needn’t take long ; just a dungeon and a
lady with her left arm and shoulder bare chained
to the wall, and evidently expecting something.
Then the big executioner and his assistant could
stalk in with the hot iron, and while the assistant
held the offender the big man could dab the iron
on her. After that there would be a little cloud
of smoke, an odour of burning adventuress (the
property-man could wave an overdone chop in the
wings), a great howl and contortion, and a faint,
the curtain would come down, and the real drama
would begin. The “ Three Musketeers,” with the
branding of Milady done in public to begin with,
and, perhaps, her execution done in public for a
conclusion, should boom greatly in the saltbush
country.

Ctiarles Holloway’s tremendously explo-
sive. drama, “ A Soldier and a Man, ” is now in its
fourth week at Sydney Lyceum. The theory that
a gentleman who has got down to the lowest
depths of gin and cloves, and is in the last stage of
weeping baby-drunk, can regenerate himself by
disembowelling the casual Zulu appeals so strongly
to the public soul that the performance will rage
for a while longer. At the Opera House “ The
Guv’nor ” takes the place of “ Dr. Bill ” on Satur-
day, and on the same night Orpheus M’Adoo’s
“ Georgia Minstrels and Celebrated Alabama
Cake-Walkers” open at the Palace. And, inas-
much as the present writer doesn’t know what
Sydney wants with five new shows in one night,
he has serious thoughts of dropping the whole lot
and taking to drink.
** * *
At Sydney Royal Standard, Manager West
still supplies wholesome amusement at bed-rock
prices. The little theatre is a boon and a blessing
to the £2 per week man, who can take his wife and
her mother and have three plush-covered front
seats for 3s. The latest production is the ever-
green “ Colleen Bawn ” of Dion Boucicault, and
the ancient J. P. West does that faithful old
scoundrel, Danny Mann, and does him very well.
The Standard audience is composed largely of the
gushing child of nature as he is in the back streets;
it weeps publicly at the pathetic parts, and makes
encouraging remarks to the troubled hero, and
wants to frankly shy its empty lemonade bottle
at the head of Mr. Corrigan, the usurer. The
man who plays the villain to a shilling, sixpenny
and threepenny audience has a hard row to hoe ;
the threepenny part of the house in particular
takes him seriously, and wants his scalp. Still the
little theatre gives good value for the money, and
any person who makes two men smile where
before one got drunk and the other loafed against
a post at a corner is a reformer in his own small
way.
** * *
The attitude at Sydney Tivoli is chiefly
one of patient waiting for certain trick bicycle
performers and a lady whistler booked by the
Moana. Meanwhile, Miss Ida Holbein sooths
the impatience with a good song and nice man-
doljn,. music, and the Leslie Brothers make much
mirth by extracting music from wood, playing de-
lightful tunes on bells and all sorts and conditions
of instruments, and startling the audience with a
revelation of what fearful shapes and sizes the
human mouth can be twisted into.
** * *
Melbourne shows at time of writing are
much the same as last week, and the wintry
managers mutter in a' sad Shakespearian tone,
Heigho ! for the wind and the rain.” At the
however, there was to be a re-appearance
of Peggy Pryde last Monday night, and although
she has already made one farewell speech on the
same premises, the festive little firework will help
to intensify the rush for Cinquevalli’s last nights.
this time is definitely announced to catch
the boat for London on June 27, and Cinquevalli
will probably be off to Sydney meanwhile with
his hat "*nbrella, cannon-ball, potato, washing-
tub, ant "lerous other features of a popularity
which doesn t wane. On Saturday the versatile
juggler introduced some new feats, and the house
shouted at hnn more than ever.

“ The King’s Musketeer ’ is to clank into
evidence at the Princess’s next Saturday (17th)
according to promise. The list of 30 names on
the programme starts with Cecil Ward, as D’Ar-
tagnan, and ends with Miss Henrietta Watson, as
the branded lady of Dumas’ capacious narrative.
Ine crowd of intermediate characters will include
Plimmer, Gustus Glover, Geo. Majeroni, Haw-
trey, Miss Hughes, Miss Raymond, Miss Mor-
tyne, and other people who are none the less
acceptable for not being new, and who will, any-
way, look rather new in the correctly-detailed
costumes of a time when sassiety used to fight in
the streets. Melbourne is prepared to welcome a
drama that, has blood and warmth in it, and
Ih® King’s Musketeer” sounds very suitable
to the occasion. Also, it will have the ad-
vantage of forming a strong contrast to
Hie forty Thieves,” which finishes on Friday.
I rom Hooley to D’Artagnan is a far cry.

Dante has left St. George’s Hall, and the
art of magic, simple and compound, is just now
testing the feeling of suburban constituencies at
sundry town halls. But at the Royal next door,
Bland Holt continues to show “ How London
Lives ’’ in five acts. The beautiful first scene,
with its convincing background and real tank-
water, is worthy of all the praise it gets, but Bland
Holt has so accustomed his * 4 3,2, 1, and six-
penny ” patrons to feasts of spectacular effect,
that they accept one of the finest stage-settings
on Australian record as a casual circumstance.
The truest word in “How London Lives” is
spoken by a low-comedy picnicker, who looks
around at the spot selected for landing the save-
loys and beer, and says— ‘ ‘ This is a, bit of alright. ”
In truth, it is a lovely place for sitting on a bloater
by accident.
*« * *
Melbourne’s present musical taste is wild
and uncertain. Miss Elsie Hall, a most deserving
little lady, has been playing her pianoforte with
very poor cash results, notwithstanding that she
is a duly certificated representative of Native
Talent, with some European honors to her credit.
People who don’t warm to Elsie seem disposed to
work up enthusiasm over Miss Una Bourne. The
newer damsel appeared at Scherek’s Orchestral
Concert at the Town Hall last Saturday afternoon
and played, from memory, the pianoforte part, in
a Schumann concerto. The performance, together
with the golden hair a-hanging down Miss Una's
back, struck a fair-sized audience in its tenderest
feelings, and Melbourne is evidently going to hear
more of this bright young artist. Therefore she
may as well receive an early caution against the
habit of looking at her audience whilst her fingers
are at work, by way of intimating how easy it all
is. This habit is disrespectful to the instrument
which provides the tune. Apart from Miss
Bourne’s success, the Scherek orchestra gave a
charming entertainment.

Fritz Mueller, an 11-year-old lad who is
going back to his native Germany to develope the
music that is in him, takes his first and only fare-
well benefit at Melb. Town Hall on Saturday
night. Fritz, on his little own, would have been
nearly big enough to fill the building at ss. a head,
and, with one song from Amy Castles thrown in,
the boy-pianist is bound to get as much benefit as
the* hall will hold. A thoughtful, old-fashioned
composer in knickerbockers is Fritz Mueller. He
strikes one as belonging to the rare order of genius
which never feels tempted to go upon the burst,
and his only trouble hereafter will be in taking
care not to die young.

The Hellers are playing to fashionable
audiences at Brisbane Opera House, and Brisbane
audiences are seldom fashionable unless they get a
free ticket. The escape of Dreyfus ; and the man
whose beard weeps half-crowns, though personally
he hasn’t the price of a pint about him at the
close of the show ; and the Burnt Woman are
among Heller’s sensations. The lady is tempted
by Mephistopheles who offers her a barrelful of
bank-notes on certain conditions which probably
can’t be fully explained in public, though they
might be written out and shown to a committee
of discreet persons over 60. But. knowing that
the bank has burst, she refuses the notes, where-
upon the fiend puts her on a pedestal and sets her
on fire. She is reduced to ashes, and her tempter
coldly wraps his tail around him and departs.
The Burnt Woman was going well in Brisbane at
latest advices.

The cable-news that Ada Crossley has
warbled at Windsor Castle, and Knocked ” the
Prince of Wales and other Royal Familians,
comes close upon the heels of a letter received by
The Bulletin from a perfervid admirer of the
Vic. contralto. The correspondent in question
(an Australian) had just been to a ballad-concert
where Crossley and Clara Butt both appeared, and
his screed was to the effect that Miss C.’s “un-
assuming manner” of singing “Sunshine and
Rain ” (good old S. and R.) shone out against the
“ vulgar stageyism ” of Miss B. Also, the loyal
Australian critic considered that Miss Butt “bel-
lowed ” her songs, and was received with rapture
soMy on aeccmnt of her being English. Which
view of the rivalry between the two contralto ladies
doesnt harmonise with the fact that Melba
achieved her celebrity on the Australian ticket.
X tie tact of the matter seems to be that the 6ft.
Dutt has the more imposing voice and stage pre-
sence, and Crossley is a more finished vocalist in a
somewhat smaller way. The latter Victorian girl
had the bad luck to meet a phenomenal voice in
Clara Butt s, whereas her compatriot, Melba, was
fortunate in getting to the front at a time when
soprano “stars” were not of much magnitude.
T here have been no great successors to Christina
-Nilsson, Tietjens, and the Albani of other days,
and even now Patti, at 56 years of age, is a higher-
priced singer than Melba. As Carlyle Smith
lately told the Argus, “ When estimating the
positions won by Australian artists abroad, we
are occasionally a trifle out in our perspective.”
At Poverty Point.
Wolf : Heard little Fritz Muller play one of his own
compositions t’other nijfht. It was somewhat difficult to
follow, and we fancied we detected unconscious filchings
from the masters; but. much of it was yood stuff, and
we listened with interest. When it was finished Fritz
jumped from his seat. “ What was it—did you know?”
We shook our heads feebly, the youthful trenius regard-
ing us with gentle scorn. “You did not know! Could
you not hear —it was the death of Beesmark.” “ I
thought I heard the funeral inarch in one part," sug 1 -
gested someone. “Aeh!” he waved his small hand
impatiently. “But did you not hear the trouble coming ?
Death fighting for lieem, the noise of the peoples. Bah !”
he smiled, “ I could not make it sound to you as I hear it
in my mind. I will play something you do know.” And
he seated himself and dashed off a smart something,
more on a level with our limited comprehension. Fritz’s
first teacher was a peculiar lady with spiritualistic beliefs.
She assured Fritz, his parents, and others, that Beetho-
ven’s spirit had come to dwell in the lad, and that any
leaching was unnecessary. Beethoven had come to visit
the world again in the chubby person of little Fritz.
Fortunately, Beethoven’s medium was soon set to un-
limited finger exercise and the study of harmony.
“ Constance Clyde ” : Sense of English decorum pro-
bably necessitates that D’Artagnan’s Constance should
be translated from a frisky matron to an innocent
damsel; also (though French literature shrieks at the in-
novation) that the garcon’s intentions, as a matter of
course, should be honorable. Likewise, English chivalry
forbids that the thrilling end of Milady should occur even
behind the scenes. The so-called manliness of the
Britisher revolts against the clubbing together of three
French gentlemen to slay a woman, even though she has
killed the mistress of one of them and done her cheerful
best to kill the three. By-the-bye, a point ! When the
headsman narrates the crimes of Milady the listeners
merely shrink a little when they hear of her stealing the
sacred silverware of the church, and keep their shrieks
till they are told of the murder she committed. Accord-
ing to the sentiment of the age should not the cup-steal-
ing business have formed the climax? It was much more
awful, then, to annex the pots and pans of the church
than merely to kill a man.
“8.5.” ; Because Amy Castles does not shake and
quiver with nervousness on the platform the general
public j’umps to the conclusion that she is too self-
possessed to have the genuine artistic temperament. The
apparent self-possession is due to her strong effort of
will, in the first place, and, after the first notes are sung,
to absorption in the music. Before going on to the plat-
form the young singer is often attacked with severe sick-
ness; and after leaving the Town Hall on the night of her
first concert she seemed almost stupefied—unable to talk
or eat or take part in anything going on around her.
Surely no other term but “nervousness” can be applied
to this.
When Amy Castles was singing in Bendigo, unknown
outside that town, she was reckoned the second best vocal
product of the local Convent of Mercy, Miss Minnie
English, daughter of the local police-sergeant, being the
top-notcher, in Bendigo estimation. What has become
of Miss English vocally is not known, but her friends
should lose no time in getting her on a platform and bill-
ing her as the associate and rival of Amy Castles.
“ Joe ” Castles, father of Amy of that ilk, is head com-
positor of Bendigo Independent— a short, stout, ruddy-
faced Kilmore native of 45, who looks at least 10 years
younger. A smart and willing boxer and a fair all-round
athlete, Joe Castles is one of the most prominent figures
in Bendigo, and was for a time captain of the cricket club
run by the Independent employes. At smoke-nights and
concerts his excellent tenor-voice is invariably on tap.
Mrs. Castles is also deemed something of a singer in the
goldfields city. “Joe” places Amy third among his
three daughters, and predicts that the two younger ones
will metaphorically mop the floor with their big sister
when they get going properly. But who ever yet heard
of a vocalist who had not a younger sister still more
promising ?
Sydney Freeman’s Journal has got the Castles fever
very badly indeed. It straightly insinuates that the
recent cabling of accounts of Melba’s successes are due to
what she has heard of “ her new rival.” Whatever Miss
Castles’ pretensions may be worth, such imbecile drivel
as this can do her no good ; and, as for the preposterous
assumption that The Bulletin cares twopence whether
the young lady is Catholic or Protestant or Cali-
thumpian, it is only necessary to point out that, had
Miss Castles not happened to be of the true believers,
The Bulletin or any other paper might have criticised
her a? it pleased without the ghost of a yelp from
malignant sectarianism.
Dr. Summers (is it Dr. Joe Summers, brother of the
late sculptor?) was running a very mixed sort of musical
entertainment at Perth (W.A.) last month. On the pro-
gramme, among many floridly-described items, there was
“ A Dramatic Scene—The Bush Skeleton.” During this
scene the Town Hall was “in. total darkness, excepting
the stage, on which by limelight the Skeleton appeared
reclining on Sands of Gold, with picks, shovels, &c., at
his feet.” An invisible singer then warbled to the accom-
paniment of a mystic orchestra :
“ Tons of bright metal I proudly won,
Which passed me on—Excelsior 1”
“St. Patrick and the Snakes” was another leading
feature of the show. They do enj’oy themselves at Perth.
The “ Liars” at the Royal is a comedy by Jones.
Which tells about, the way a married lady went astray—
At least she nearly did it—on a pleasant summer day,
By dining with an African philanthropist out late
In a bower beside a river. There were flowers ana silver
plate,
And beneath the gas-globe’s glitter he told of golden
shores
In Africa, where the unmitigated lion roars.
And breathing in her ear he asked with low impassioned
tones
That she would bolt with him, in this same comedy by
Jones.
But a stranger finds them dining there in Jones’s
comed-i/,
The philanthropist is hugging her j’ust as he passes by ;
And the lady in affright makes a scared retreat by night—
She hasn’t any dinner, for she leaves it in her flight;
She persuades some kindly friends to stand by her and
swear
That there wasn’t any dinner, and, besides, she wasn’t
there;
That the bower was all a legend, and the victuals were a
mist,
And there never had been any African philanthropist.
But no one seems to heed them, and obscene birds pick
the bones
Of the lady’s reputation in this comedy of Jones.
And here an inspiration strikes the heroine of Jones.
She j'ust tells things as they be, with no embroidery
Of lie, or frill, or fiction on the little history
How she was half-beguiled by tales of Afric’s storied
shore,
And was half-inclined to go there just to hear the lion
roar.
The dinner is forgiven ; the case is then and there dis
missed ;
No one even stops to kick the African philanthropist;
And the Liars who so nobly stood by their troubled
friend,
She doesn’t even thank them when her troubles reach an
end,
And they probably feel sorry that they listened to the
moans
Of an ungrateful heroine in this comedy by Jones.
As to the story that manager Williamson offered to
educate Miss Amy Castles in Paris for three years on con-
dition that she should play a two years’ engagement with
him thereafter, the facts of the case appear to be that
J.C.VV. never gave a thought to Miss Amy’s vocal possi-
bilities in the future. He merely considered her as a
present Boom, and his proposal was to pay her £6O a
week for one song nightly in “ The Forty Thieves” dnring
the Melbourne season of that pantomime.
A recent Bulletin par., mentioning the names of several
old Australian favorites who appear with Charles Arnold
in “ What Happened to Jones ” (at the Strand Theatre
London), ought to have made special mention of George
Encyl Lewis, who bosses the orchestra. Conductor Lewis
is the Australian native son of Mr. and Mrs. G. B. W
Lewis. Judging from sundry presentations made to him
during the run of “Jones,” he ranks as a considerable
factor in the show’s success. Talking of “Jones,” it is
not likely that Arnold will bring it along to this side of
the world before the first Easter in next century.
A one-time actor, said to have played with G. V.
Brooke, is now' a well-to-do gatherer of bones and bottles
at Footscray (Melb.) He wears his hair long, indulges in
stock Shakespearian quotations, and has a fine dramatic
style of placing the bottles in his sack.
Cinquevalli devoted his first evening in Melbourne to a
careful inspection of Dante’s show, and he liked it much.
“Melb.”: Demise, ex-civil servant Richard Capper.
Son of Richard Capper, Coppin’s stage carpenter,
and a useful comedian, at Melb. Queen’s Theatre.’
Old-man Capper wrote a vast number of plays, mostly in
five acts. A volume has been published.' He made a
good effort to reach the century, and, as carpenter at
Drury Lane, had known Byron and E. Kean.
George Leslie, who was imported for the part of Harry
Bronson in “ Belle of New York,” would make a strikin'!*

“ Yang Anyut ’’: Stood outside tip-top Sydney theatre,

came out. “My sister,” said a voice behind me. I looked
round and found owner—no sixpenny doss-house would
take him, unboiled. Just behind came another woman
a year or two older. “My wife,” said the man to his
mate. The first girl turned at the moment, and flushed
uncomfortably, but the wife met his look with a freezing
stare, stepped into a pair-horse brougham, and the two
drove off. Tragedy or comedy—or both ?

was P otted at Adelaide sessions. Kitchen was
more versatile than his predecessors, as his lusty
local-preaching (he preached on the Sunday before

COLUMN
Whenever MacLaurin or Dibbs or any other
fossil of the Cabbage-Tree Mob starts ou tlie question of
Federal finance be always quotes Tasmania as the typical
necessitous province—as the one which depends most on
customs revenue, and the one which will have to be
“assisted” and the one whose painful dependence on
customs makes a heavy Federal tariff imperative. Yet,
curiously enough, it is Queensland, and not Tasmania,
that mostly answers this description among the eastern
mates The following figures on the subject are mostly
taken from Coghlan’l “Statistics of the Seven Colonies”
for 1891-98 N.S.W. Tasmania. Q’nsland.
Customs and excise „„ „ n» 7

Therefore, if the three provinces had all reduced
their customs and excise taxation as far as their surplus
would allow, N.S.W. would have required to raise £1 Is.
lOd per head per annum; Tasmania, £1 16s. lid. ;
Queensland, £2 13s. 9d. But if Tasmania had shoved as
much of its expenditure into loan charges as N.S.W., and
if Queensland had charged as little of its expenditure to
loans as N.S.W.—if they had all paid £1 4s. lOd. per head
of their expenditure out of loans as N.S.W. did, and then
reduced their customs and excise taxation as far as they
could while still making ends meet—N.S.W. would have
required to raise £1 Is. lOd. per head per annum in cus-
toms and excise ; Tasmania £1 Is. 6d. (4d. per head per
annum less than N.S.W.) ; and Queensland £3 ts. 7d.
And if these three provinces absolutely gave up borrow-
ing and agreed to pay all public-works expenditure out of
revenue, and made up the shortage with customs and ex-
cise, N.S.W. would need to raise out of customs and ex-
cise’£2 6s. Bd. per head per annum ; Tasmania £2 6s. 4d.;
Queensland £4 12s. sd. Also, incidentally, Victoria, with
no borrowing, would need to raise about £2 6s. And
these results are arrived at despite the fact that the Tas-
manian land-tax is only |d. in the £, against Id. in
N.S.W. Tasmania runs its State Government so very
much more cheaply than any other province that, despite
its smaller resources, it could afford to lend part of its
surplus to the “ necessitous” Cornstalk to keep him afloat.
The Dibbs-MacLaurin push has a mean, inces-
sant, undying grudge against Victoria because it is the
only State which has attempted to rival N.S.W., and the
only one which has grown a city that can overshadow
Sydney. And they regard Tasmania as Victoria’s satel-
lite, and Queensland as their own satellite. This is the
reason why they hold up Tasmania (which, on an abso-
lutely equal basis, tariff and otherwise, would be one of
the most solvent States in the Commonwealth) as the
awful example, while Queensland, which is the worst diffi-
culty among the Eastern States, is hardly mentioned.
Yet even Queensland, as it has all its possibilities of direct
taxation still before it, isn’t a difficulty. In fact, there is
no real financial difficulty anywhere.

The loud Fat Men who say that representa-
tion in the Federal Senate should go by population only
don’t act up to their creed in their own .business dealings.
Take the case of the Australian banks. In the A.J.S. the
man with 10 shares has one vote, and the man with 3000
shares has 33, so he has only one-ninth of the voting
power he should have. Or look at this table :

There is no discrepancy in the Federal Senate representa-
tion which comes within 1000 miles of this. The Fat
Man, when he is running his own business to malee it pay
has no such thing as equal representation. He gives the
biggest proportion of voting power to the smallest
partner—the one with least property.
In Dunedin alone the Maoriland Old-Age Pen-
sion system is saving £3l 16s. 6d. a week (over £l6OO a
year)’in charitable relief. In many cases the Old-Age
Pension costs no more than the charitable relief did. The
difference is that under the old system the recipient was
called a pauper and had to be ’umble. Under the new
one he is a respectable aged citizen, to whom the State is
making some acknowledgment for past services to the
country, and ’umbleness isn’t expected from him.

The South Australian Co. —S. A. ’s great absentee
land-holding incubus—made a profit of £29,628 last year.
A 10 per cent, dividend absorbs £28,400, and the other
£1228 is carried to reserve. The great S.A. curse started
business in 1836 by getting a huge grant of S.A. land upon
giving its solemn word as a gentleman that it had no
mercenary purpose, and only proposed out of pure
philanthropy to help distressed and deserving Britishers
to make new homes in S.A. It kept its word so well that
for the last 14 years its dividend has ranged from 9 to 15
per cent., and whereas the paid-up capital is only
£284,000 the assets are valued at about £1,036,000 —an
accumulated profit of over £750,000. And this great
British lie and steal, which obtained its land bv false pre-
tences, complains of the S.A. graduated land-tax as an
outrage and a thing which tends to discourage honest
British enterprise.

The prospectus of the Sydney Harbor Residen-
tial Club Co. has j'ust been put before the public of
Sydney. It begins by stating that the co. is in 22,000 £l-
- of which the “promoter and vendor” are to
receive 6000 fully paid-up gratis, “in full payment.” Yet
the vendor apparently doesn’t vend anything at all except
the idea, and the promoter doesn’t pay any of the ex-
promoting. The purchase and fitting-up of the
ship which is to form the floating club, also brokerage,
advertising, gnd all the rest, come out of the £16,000
whic() the public is asked to subscribe. The prospectus
taiksi of a piofit of 40 per cent., so the man who asks for
£6OOO worth qf khares gratis is asking for a comfortable
income of £2400 a year—which looks like stupendous

want of privacy-the 255. 6d men are two in a cabm, and

even in a commodious vessel, is a very small affair so that
the average member must live m the ciush of '
sidents and the 1000 honoraries. And even
grows wearisome after a while, and some people don t
like brass bands. The best feature seems to be that the
keeper of this floating hash-tower won t be the regulation
depressed lady who has seen better days, borne en-
couraging people put themselves down as “ patronis and

will hear the brass band without paying for it.

In the advertising columns of this issue appears
the prospectus of W. E. Smith, Limited-a co. which is
being formed to take over the great printing and station-
ery business of Mr. VV. E. Smith, Bridge-street, Sydnej.
The business is a long-established one, and the piofits, for
the past nine years, have averaged nearly ' 7(100 a, year
equal to 10 per cent, on the proposed issue of *70,000
capital. Vendor asks only .- 5613 for «ie goodwill-
actually £387 less than the promoters of the limited

The real property, which cost £33,971, is offered to the
co. at £23,971 ; there are no liabilities ; and vendor
guarantees full payment of the book-debts taken over.
Altogether Smith, Limited, looks a sound concern and a
fair investment.*

Broken Hill municipal council has now entered
into thorough-going opposition to B.H. Water hupp y.
Ltd., and is having surveys made of another available
watershed, feeding a natural reservoir. It is still hoped,
however, that the co. will sell out to Govt. ; but, ei en if
that is arranged, a second reservoir will he agitated tor.
The mines are now quite dependent upon sulphide ore,
and sulphide ore must undergo a preliminary local con-
centration ; and a large supply of water is necessary for
that. When local people and others interested think ot
what would happen if there was (say) a collapse ot the
embankment built across the creek and forming the reser-
voir, they grow uneasy.
* * *
Part of the Broken Hill labor bodies is shriek-
ing with the rest of them that this is a pretty good
Federal Bill, but not good enough—has several defects in
it, and hence should not be accepted. But that argument
has had a bad local knock. Broken Hill now depends
altogether upon the sulphides ; and, so far, they can only
get about 50 per cent, of the silver and /5 per cent, of the
lead out of the ore—the rest goes over the dump. Im-
provements are gradually being made, resulting in a
better recovery ; wherefore the local howlers are being
invited to also agitate for the shutting-down of all the
mines and the mills until the improvements have been
completed. » *’ *
The success of the Continental people in treat-
ing B.H. zinc-ore, followed by the local erection of
machinery to concentrate the material, has already taken
two or three leading Australian metallurgists to the
Patents Office. Hitherto the thing generally aimed at
was a process for leaching out the zinc ; now the expen-
ments are trending towards a mechanical (most often a
magnetic) separation' of the zinc from the gangue, with
the primary object of reducing the bulk for export pur-
poses. Of course, the work cannot be clean, hut it will
serve as a beginning. It is reckoned that there are 700,000
tons of crushed material now dumped on the surface of
B.H. mines, assaying 20 per cent, zinc and over (zinc is
worth E 26 per ton), besides silver and lead. With the
exception of small parcels, all this has hitherto been re-
garded as waste, for the present anyhow.
Horse-haulage and machine-drill work are being
steadily extended in-Broken Hill mines, where the sul-
phide bodies are big and have to be handled wholesale.
Formerly the machine-drills were used only on country
roc k—in driving, crosscutting, and so on. But now the
ore is brought down that way, too. Block 10, which has
just started the new plan, finds that the output per man
has jumped from 1-2 ton per shift (eight hours) to 1’45
ton—a big difference where 300 men are concerned.
. * * *
Once more the perpetually-disputed question of
mine-taxation for municipal purposes bobs up—this time
at Broken Hill. B.H. Proprietary has been paying the
local council about £2OOO a year, but this year (possibly
on account of every one of the last four seats contested
being- collared by Labor aldermen) the co. refuses to pay
anything. There will probably be a fight, though the
Courts will not find much in the Municipalities Act of
N.S.W. to help them decide on what basis mines ought to
be assessed —and that really is the point at issue.
* * * *
The expert who came from London a few
months ago to report on the Gallyinont mine (N.S.W.),
administered its death-blow in reporting there was
nothing to jusl ify a reconstruction. It had none of the
characteristics of a div.-payer. A circular issued to
shareholders says samples taken from the mine were
tampered with, and regrets that general-manager Eissler,
who took a number of samples himself, did not discover
this ; it was remarkable that he also failed to discover
that the reefs, instead of carrying long shoots of ore, were
made up of short shoots with long blanks, of barren
ground between—hence his estimates were wholly
fallacious. The mine is now exploited by tributors, and
though the co. does not expect to derive much income
from the arrangement it thinks there is a possibility of
some fresh discovery being made. Total loss on this
transaction must have been upwards of £lOO,OOO.

N.S.W. Mines Minister Cook has been a-going
it Said at the opening of Mr. Garland’s dredge on the
Macquarie River that he often wondered why Victoria,
with only one metal (gold) to mine, was so far ahead
of N.S.W. with its incomparable mineral resources.
Allowing for exceptions, the Vic. mines were worked for
what they were worth as mines. In N.S.W. the mine was
often the' last consideration. The first was to get gold out
of the people’s pockets ; it was all hoodie, boodle, gamble,
gamble, with the result that the mining industry had
been dragged down to insignificance, and had been
made a by-word and a reproach. . It was difficult
to suggest a remedy, but it was to be hoped the
good sense of the community would prevail, and little’
further countenance would be given to palpable boodle-
dum. Amongst other things, Mr. Cook remarked that
over 20,000 acres had been applied for for dredging pur-
poses in N.S.W., hut very few leases had been issued to
date. The business had been worked up into a boom in
which the curse of over-capitalisation has asserted itself.
One co. had a capital of £40,000, and the market-value ot
the shares is nearly double that amount. In another in-
stance shares were quoted at a premium, although the
lease had not been issued. He saw enough to convince
him they were dredging for gold in Sydney more than on
the river flats. City flats, not country flats. *
The biggest shareholder in Great Cobar outside
the lucky tributors is John Downer, Q.C., of Adelaide,
who obstinately refuses to sell out and derides the stereo-
typed “ buyers 705.” of the stock-exchange list. J.D.
believes that the tributor? can sell if they choose for say
£l4 a share and he means to be in at the finish.

Gibraltar (N.S.W.) manager Ei.ssler, in his re-
port, placed the mine’s ore-reserves at 21,000 tons, con-
taining 44,3000 z. Actual yield for year showed a little
over loz. per ton, and there is little profit in that, the
vein being small and ground very hard. Altogether, the
' Anglo-Australian co. is having a bad time.

Mr. G. B. B. Elliott has given the Arous a
great yarn about the richness of the Inverell (N.S.W.)
diamond-fields, and produces 530 carats of small diamonds
in support of it. He declares that in a short time S.
Africa will be nowhere. It is hard to place faith in any-
one who talks like that. Though the fields have been
known for years, the total diamond-output does not equal
that taken out of one South African mine a month.

The nasty knock to the Westralian market last
week was attributed to the trouble in the Transvaal,
Rand stocks having slumped—Westralians followed “ in
sympathy.” Had they boomed it .would certainly have
been said the Transvaal trouble had diverted millions
into the W.A. market. That would have been a more
sensible reason. Anyhow, Dr. Jamieson had more to do
with the creation of the Westralian “ Wild Cat ” boom
four years ago than any other individual, for suspending
speculation in one place meant starting it in another.
Westralians have never been so inflated as in these last
three months, and during that time Rands have been in a
bad way. At time of writing, Westralians were slowly
moving upwards again, but, as sure as night follows day,
so sure is an awful slump coming. Not so much, perhaps,
in the great mines as in the small ones surrounding them.
As usual, N.S.W. will be the greatest victim in proportion
to the number of investors. They are coming in at the
top, which means they will be left in, and are paying
shillings for shares they would not look at at pence.
Not long ago Tuckanarra —a sleepy little mining
camp on the Murchison -provided a sensation in the
shape of a 240 z. per ton crushing from Boyd’s claim, but
since then the Govt, battery has done scarcely anything
except to burst the hopes of other leas“-holders. Two of
the latest crushings : Ross and Guthrie’s claim, 10 tons
for soz. 18dwt. Guthrie’s quartz claim, 11 tons for 3oz.

“ Tom the Ragcr,’ an original character on
Murchison (W.A.) goldfield, has just sold his interest in
one of the Peak Hill leases for £15,000, thereby giving a
hard knock to Darlington Simpson, chairman of the big co.
“ The Rager ” is a thin, wiry old Irishman, minus several
fingers, and gifted with a husky, jerky voice that at times
rises to the majesty of a foghorn. His first appearance
on Australian goldfields dates back as far as the first rush
to Bendigo, ever since which he has “ followed the dig-
gings.” He was one of the first in the swim in N.Q., and
later on turned up at ill-fated Kimberley, and made a
memorable journey across the biggest part of Westralia —
right down to the present Murchison goldfield, accom-
panied only by his dog Paddy. Subsequently Tom got
into one of the richest claims at Peak Hill, and resisted
the blandishments of Darlington Simpson, who had in-
duced all the surrounding leaseholders to transfer then-
claims in consideration of a three months’ option, on terms.
Tom demanded bright shining shekels in exchange for
his verv dotty signature. Simpson laughed him to scorn,
and “The Rager’s” dander rose. So, for nearly two
years, Peak Hill Goldfields, Limited, 250,000 shares (ap-
parently more or .less pooled in London and recently
quoted at £0), have unavailingly tried to deal. The
original offer for Tom’s interest was only £3OOO at three
months, and a share interest.
t m * * *
It would seem that the well-boosted Peak-hill
(W.A.) Goldfields, Ltd. has got into a very tight place
indeed through the failure of the boss to secure “Tom
the Rager's ” interests in the North Star and Polar Star
leases, into which, it is averred, the whole of the aurifer-
ous deposit is. underlying. An effectual “dead-set”
seems to have been made against the co., for it is printed
in W.A. that, “as the other claims to the eastward are
pretty nearly worked out, it becomes imperatively neces-
sary to acquire the interests in question to give the co. an
opportunity of working profitably. The position is ren-
dered still more serious by Mr. Lloyd having purchased on
behalf of English capitalists, who are likely to severely
squeeze the co. In every way it is a pretty kettle of fish,
which must form anything but a delectable dish for those
who have placed their money in the co.’s care. Divs. are
impossible until this matter is squared, and it looks about
as easy at present to square the circle as to square Lloyd
and Go.” In a note to the prospectus the promoters ap-
pear to have set forth that included in the contract of
purchase by the co. were 24 claims or leases, for which
contracts had been concluded except for certain fractions
of said claims, described as “ too small to materially affect
the prospects of the co.” Now it transpires that said
fractions, which have been bought over the co.’s head,
despite its representative’s strenuous exertions to secure
them, “ include five-sixteenths of the. Polar Star and North
Star,’formerly held by Tom O’Meehan, and now the pro-
perty of Mr. Llovd ; three-tenths of the Margaretting and
one-sixth of the Margaretting South, also held by Mr.
Lloyd. The smallness of these interests may be guaged
from the fact that Mr. Lloyd gave £15,000 cash for O’Mee-
han’s interest alone.”

There are so many mishaps, and breakages, and
delays and leakages in connection with Westralian public
batteries that some people are beginning to wonder
whether it is seriously intended that they should be a
success. Men who. ought to know reckon up that in some
cases more is being paid out in attendants’ wages than is
being received in crushing
Lake View Consols, W. A., has had a real boom
crushing. “Over 1) ton of gold” is the heading under
which May output (33,0000 z.) is given in the papers. The
value is set down at £96,000, which is obviously too little,
and apparently applies to the shipped ore alone ; it should
be about £35,000 more. No-allusion to the fact that the
gold from shipped ore is nearly three times as great as

the other of spasmodic occurrence, so it can hardly be in-

An English co. offers to buy the celebrated
Golden Gate mine, Mathinna (Tas.), for £400,000 (equal to
£l2 10s. a share). A controlling interest in the mine,
21,685 shares, is held by the executors of the late W. H.
Brock, whose real estate, apart from his mining interest,
is worth £82,000, and his personal interest another
£12,000. Deceased's will provided that no sale should be
made until his youngest child (now eight) attained
majority, and Tas. Supreme Court doubts whether it can
set aside this provision.

The South Tharsis Copper Co., Mt. Lyell,
have lately entered into a contract with the Austral Otis
Engineering Co., South Melbourne, to supply a complete
crushing and concentrating plant for treatment of their
ores, which are mostly low grade. The plant is to be a
very complete one and comprises compound steam-engine
and boiler of 100 horse-power, 3 rock-breakers, 2 sets Roger
rolls, 8 4-compartment eccentric jiggs, 4 improved buddies
and Otis circular vanner, with the necessary trommels,
&c., for sizing and classifying the ore. The plant
has a capacity of 100 tons per day, with provision
for 200 tons. The Otis Co. are also supplying a self-acting
tramway from the mine to the mill: also, a pumping plant
to supply the mill with water from the dam.

Down at the bottom of the Barambogie (Vie.)
miners’strike or lockout—it doesn’t matter much which
it is called—is the old, old trouble of the non-recognition
of mining apprentices. The miner’s is a skilled calling;
and yet in Australia the apprentice system is unknown.
Sometimes a youngster gets some sort of training as a
trucker ; quite as often it is as a full-blown miner that a
man goes down a shaft for the first time in his life. If he
doesn’t own up to his mate then an accident is likely to
happen—and the mate is as likely to be the victim as the
other. The owners know, of course ; and sometimes, as
at Barambogie, they put “ improvers ” on at work need-
ing comparativelydittle skill, offering less than standard
pay for it. And then there is trouble. It should not be
impossible to arrange an apprentice system ; but so far
all suggestions that way have been promptly knocked out.

The vagaries of fruit-growing are illustrated in
a couple of recent Melb. Age items. At Castlemaine
Warden’ Court, June 2, several growers deposed that they
had done well out of fruit crops from waste land taken
up after the diggers had done with it. One obtained
last year from one acre no less than two tons of straw-
berries, which averaged 4£. per lb., equal to £B4 per acre.
Another su'd he had obtained, for 15 years past, from
£lOO to £l5O per acre from fruit. That there is big
money in fruit export is most certain, but a letter in same
paper a day or two previous shows up a very weak spot
in the business, and one that Minister Taverner —in the
intervals of entertaining pseudo-royalty, and swearing
that “ Empiresh all one sholid—hie—homogeneity which
will shtand or fall together ’’—might do worse than attend
to. The writer, a Doncaster (Melb.) fruit-grower, gives
account-sales of some fruit exported by him. One hun-
dred and fifty cases of apples, at various prices, realised
£59 4s. ; dock-dues, insurance, commission, etc., came to
£Blos., leaving £5O 14s. Then came the staggering item
—“ Ocean freight, at 4s. Id. per case, £3O 12s, ud.,” leav-
ing but £2O, out of nearly £6O, for the grower. Seeing
that apples are a good carrying fruit; and that the ship-
ping co’s. are not over-careful of fruit cargoes as a rule,
it is’no wonder the grower prefers the low price ruling
locally to risking his produce on the London market for
the sole profit of the steamer people.
South Australia has only one private line, the
Gienelg railway, and the Kingston Govt, has been for
years trying to' buy it. The co. hangs on, however, so
the State is now resorting to its legal powers of compul-
sory purchase. The Glenelg co.’s little 20-mile monopoly
lies in the suburbs of Adelaide, and the necessity for its
purchase arises from the exorbitant fares charged by the
much-execrated concern. It has a nominal paid-up capi-
tal of £164,500 (£94,000 ordinary and £70,500 preference),
but of this only £117,500 was really paid in cash, the rest
being inflation. For years it has paid 10 per cent, on its
preference capital and'from 3 to 5 per cent, on ordinary
capital, making an average of about 7 per cent, all round.
The State, being content with 3J per cent., could give
considerably reduced fares, but there are legal complica-
tions in the’way of the purchase.

All the Australian Parliaments should give
their early attention to inventing a law to throttle the
ghoulish time-payment monster. Why the person who
sells £lO worth (alleged) of ramshackle tables and chairs,
payable in 20 weekly instalments of 10s., should be
allowed to seize and keep the lot if the last 10s. is a few
days overdue, instead of realising at auction only the half-
sov. still due and absolutely necessary expenses, passes
the comprehension of civilised man.

There was a long delay in the telegraphing
of the Birthday honors. The delay betokened
some hitch at 'Orae-probably differences of
opinion in ’igh circles. The M‘Eacharn knight-
hood most unexpectedly did not arrive. Yet it
made sure of in the proper quarters. The
Melbourne Mayor has been told that it is “ All
right, my boy.”
• • * •
After the knighting of editor Bonython,
of A. Advertiser, and S.M. Herald proprietor
Mister James,’ the hearts of several Australian
dailies were fluttering over the delay in the publica-
tion of this year’s Birthday “ honors.” Which
recalls the anecdote re “ Joe ” Syme— not Jos.—
when he was in the Age office (he sold out
for something like <£150,000, to which he has
considerably added in Mt. Lyell and other specu-
lations). Joe came in one 25th May, and, with a
puzzled face, remarked to the accountant, “Look
here, Rogers, I’ve received a letter from Govt.
House saying they’ve got a knighthood therefor
me. I hardly know what to do about it—surely
the thing must be meant for David ” (his uncle,
now sole proprietor of the Age). Rogers, reckoned
always one of the shrewdest of Melb. men, “fell
in ’ straight away. “No ! ” he yelled, excitedly.
You stick to it yourself. They’ll have to give
David another, if there’s any mistake. Don’t you
give it lip ! ” And, for 24 hours, Rogers went
about his work firmly convinced that Joe Syme
was getting a knighthood on his advice.

He Chief Justice Way’s baronetcy, a point
is to be noticed. Of late years the title-mongers
at the Government offices in London have take,.
to doling out hereditary titles to those who do not
usually come in for such when there is a reasonable
prospect that there will be no heirs. Thus it was
recently remarked, when Mr. Justice Hawkins
retired from the English Bench and was made u
peer, that it Was most unusual to confer a peerage,
on a puisne Judge. Why was it done ? Because
Hawkins was a childless old man. And why a
baronetcy instead of a G.C.M.G. star for Cliief
Justice Way ?

Disunion. Jack, when N.S.W. Attorney-
General declined to pay cab-hire for barristers
who wished to show their wigs to Gov. Hampden
on his arrival and, as a consequence, the band of
brief-hunters had the ineffable front to stay away
l ? ,df though why these rapacious persons
should be carted to Govt. House at State expense
any wore than the city nightmen or dog-catchers
should be so carted is an absolute mystery. On
Gov. Beauchamp’s arrival Premier Reid, then
acting as Attorney-General, dumped down cab-
hire (out of the public purse, of course) and the
bewigged swarmed into the vice-regal presence.
Reid s goodness (out of the public purse) to
M. sL. A. and barristers is never-failing. The
Bulletin hopes to hear this outrageous cab-job
business discussed in the Assembly.

The proposal to call the new C.E. diocese
-in the extreme North “New Australia, ” should
be promptly squashed on many accounts. The
region comprises the tropical belt of land cover-
ing thousands of miles in N.Q. and the N. Terri-
tory, and its main population at present is
Chinese, Japanese, and aboriginal. The term
“New Australia ” bears no application to such a
mixture ; nor does it fit the tract of country or its
characteristics ; and, further, its appropriation is
theftuous. Still more, it adds another to the long
list of geographical blunders whereby two or more
places are made to wear the same label. Why
shouldn’t the new gaiteree simply call himself
Bishop of Carpentaria or Port Darwin ? Primate
Smith sanctions “New Australia,” and is pre-
pared to start the show as soon as a capital of
<£lo,ooo is secured; Collectors are now busy on
the subject in England, and the remaining £4OOO
is expected to roll in speedily.
* * * *
Judges Griffith and Chubb dissented from
the majority of members of Queensland law-
reform commission which recommends that the
death-penalty be no longer inflicted for rape. The
argument generally used to support the retention
of hanging for rape is that it is specially neces-
sary to protect lonely women in the bush. Which
would perhaps be good reasoning but for the fact
that a man might as well be hanged for a sheep
as for a lamb—might as well chance swinging for
the murder of the woman he had outraged. Dead
women tell no tales.
Ihe probability that the recent stealing of
5000 sovs. from the R.M.S. Alameda was long
fore-planned recalls the clever scoop once made
by a gang who took to a S. African diamond-
fields a choice assortment of safes, sold them all,
and, having ostensibly departed, came surrep-
titiously back and cleaned-out said safes by means
of master-keys.
* * * *
Re. the Alameda gold-robbery. It is not
so very difficult to commit a gold-robbery on a
steamer ; the real difficulty is to get the “swag ”
safely ashore. Under present arrangements, the
filthy lucre is kept in an alleged strong-room away
down in the dark innards of the ship, where, if he
can stand the odor of bilge-water and the deceased
rat, there is nothing to prevent the frolicsome
pirate rolling in the treasure. The coin is put
down in that dark, secluded place so as to make
sure that the pirate won’t be disturbed while
breaking in. The keys of this alleged strong-
room are kept by the captain and chief officer,
who either hang them in their cabins or carry them
about in their clothes. Sometimes they arb kept
in a safe, and even then the man who has the key
of the safe must go to sleep sometimes, and once a
man is in a gentle sleep it is easy to assist him
into a deep slumber till an impression of the great,
ungainly, treasure-room key is taken. It is im-
possible to successfully hide a treasure-room key,
as it is always a huge, heavy construction that
is only fit to be humped around in a wheelbarrow.
On the return trip there are at least three people
who have strong-room keys, sometimes four, and
then, as the locks are never by any chance
changed, some day there is a mysterious gold
robbery. Any co. that wants to absolutely pre-
vent gold-robberies should build on deck a strong
steel cage covered by two other strong steel cages
a few square feet larger, the two keys of which
should be kept by the managers at the two
terminal ports; also the locks thereon should be
changed every trip. And an electric-light should
glare right on the treasure from'sunset to sunrise.
This may not absolutely annihilate the gold-
robbery but it will reduce it to such a degree of
rarity that it can be safely provided against as an
“Act. of God.” When the treasure is on deck,
and visible through the bars of the cage, it could
hardly go without being missed. And it would be
about as easy to. steal it as to steal a man’s socks
off him while he is walking.

N.S. W. Premier Reid and his Unemployed
Commission are groping in the dark after a solu-
tion of the old question without resorting to the
simple device of an old-age pension scheme.
G. H. Reid “ would be sorry to see any of these
new departures carried out by merely and ex-
clusively official agencies,” which means that he
wants to give the cleric and other amateur philan-
thropists another chance of failing as they have
failed before. They fail because Bible isn’t work,
and prayer isn’t boots, and hymns aren’t ham and
bread, and faith doesn’t spell food—not nowadays,
anyhow. When the bush cleric, who is a profes-
sional believer, can hardly make his own daily
victuals, what chance is there for the purely
amateur believer ?

South A ustra-
lia has a law,
passed in 1896,
which leaves to
the electors the
right lo decide

Recent polling
resulted in victo-
ries for the Cold-
tea party in three
big city electo-
rates, and, as a
result, new li-
censes cannot be
granted in such
districts until a
fresh poll decides
to the contrary.
The new law,
which is fre-
quently in direct
opposition to
public conveni-
ence, was passed
as a concession to
theW.C.T.U. by
Premier Kings-
ton during one of
his pious mo-
ments. The pub-
licans naturally vote unaninjouoiy with the tem-
perance crowd in the interest of their already-
established hotels, but the real test will come
when it is proposed to reduce the number of ex-
isting grog-factories.

Apropos of the Loch Sloy survivors, it is
curious how helpless shipwrecked sailors often are
when they get ashore. Years ago a ship, bound
for Rockhampton, was lost on Curtis Island, then
a cattle-run. Crew landed safely, and wandered
about. Two post-and-rail fences crossed the
island. The sailors struck both of them more
than once, and got over them. If they had had
sense enough to follow either fence to the slip-
panel, they would have struck the track to the
home-station. As it was, they were found, half-
starved, by a stockman who came across their
tracks.

A curious result of the latter-day rivalry
of S.M. Herald and Telegraph. Neither will
print its second edition (which circulates in the
city) until the cricket cables come out. If they
are late the papers are late. One morning during
the test-match Sydney did not get its paper until
7-30 ! The public blame the news-agents who can
only curse. They deputationised the newspaper
managers, but no modus vivendi can be arrived at.
Yet both journals bemoan the interest taken by
young Australia in athletics to the neglect of
more material things.

Mehitabel de Courcy James
Had several dozen rustic flames.
From early spring to fading fall
She was a sister to them ail;
From fall to spring, through smile and pout,
They squired the maiden week about.
Her conduct’s cause we thus may trace—
The James’s were a mountain race;
And all the summer, sad to tell,
Their boarders squired Mehitabel—
While several dozen mountaineers
Sat round on fences, shedding tears.
Years passed. One eve in early May
The maiden churchwards took her way,
Expectant of the usual man:
Forthwith that once-devoted clan
Began with phrases most profuse
Unitedly to make excuse.
Reggie and Ted were “going out";
Jack suffered from incipient gout;
Ralph had turned Quaker, Mike turned Jew —
Something was queer with all the crew;
Edgar, moi e youthful and more curt,
Spoke out: “Miss James, we loathe a flirt!”
His bitter sneer, so undeserved,
Left the shy maiden quite unnerved;
She faltered, pined, went home to bed—
And in the morning she was dead.
The village mourned—“ Farewell! f arewell!
To much maligned Mehitabel! ’’
Now, every bitter winter’s night
(Most of the rhymes for this are trite)
Along the cemetery posts
Sit several dozen grieving ghosts,
And sneeze remorsefully —“ Farewell!
Mehit—ahit—ahhitabel! ’’

To Theßulletin from northern N.S.W. :—
There lived here for many years a man who had a
flourishing cabinet-making and undertaking business,
was an alderman, and, altogether, a personage in his
little circle. In burying a Chinaman he was helped by
his son, who, having a sore hand when dealing with the
defunct, contracted leprosy, and was eventually sent to
the lazaret, where he still is, unless happily dead. Ever
since the nature of his disease became known, however,
the townspeople have strictly boycotted his parents with
the idea of driving them from the district. Their fore-
man started a rival business, and took away all the trade,
and even the religious (?) bodies declined to give him
work, although in his prosperity none had been readier
than he to aid the local charities. He and his wife
nevertheless struggled on until, a few months ago, the
climax came. The poor old man contracted blood-poison-
ing, resulting in an ugly sore on a finger, whereupon again
arose the cry of “ Leprosy ! ” driving the unhappy pair at
last away from the town, and now they are in Sydney,
utterly destitute, at the ages, respectively, of 70 and t>s,
while doubtless the Christian community up North con-
tinues cheerfully to employ the local Chinese to do its
washing and hawk its vegetables. Vote for Federation .
Ay ! for only a United Australia, with single voice, can
relieve us from the Plague-bringer.

Another postal anomaly under provincial-
ism. It costs a half-penny to send a paper from
Silverton to Cockbnrn. But if the paper is
carried on past Cockburn, round by Adelaide and
Melbourne and on to Sydney, the charge is
nothing at all.

“Ellerdale ” on police identification
Had occasion to goto one of our suburban Police-courts
to idenHfv I young man who had passed a orged order
on me Police went out into the street to collar someone
t-0 DUt with accused ; got three very small schoolboys and
_ n n f qv. go. Anyone could have picked out
accused ' No man in his senses would have cashed an
order for any of the infants, and the ancient was too
blind to forge anything. Then the policeman went into
court and swore: “Your Worship, prisoner was picked
out from among others.” It was like putting a camel
and four grasshoppers in a line, and then identifying t e
camel first try.
A big effort is being made to set up a
foundlings’ home in Melbourne, where there is
much need of strong competition with the common
™ garden baby-dealer. Unfortunately the prowl-
ing prudes are pushing the cause, and the publio
has lost confidence in the stamp of female in whom
charity is merely another form of curiosity.
The female bosses of Melb. Women’s Hospital
wax shrill in their efforts to excuse the labelling of
married and unmarried patients in the maternity
ward, and keep on doing it. When women have
the managing of it, charity uncovers a multitude
of sins.
One authority writing on above subject declares
that women who have no license of their own
make their sins respectable by appealing to desti-
tute widowers ; these latter hire out their wives
marriage-certificates and their names to women
who have pressing need for temporary refuge
under an alias.

Edifying hunk from a recent War Cry :
It is the registration-room that tests the quality of the
converts, and in this instance the results were Uod-glon-
fyinu'. ... A lassie who had backslidden, owing to her
unwillingness to offer for the work, came out heart-
broken. took off her engagement-ring, promised God to
give up her fianci, and interviewed the Commandant
straight away.
Note that this “God-glorifying result” was a
direct outcome of Booth and the Nose their
eloquence. The young man is to be congratulated
who thus escapes being tied-up to so ill-balanced
a being as “the heart-broken lassie,” but what
about the hideous absurdity of representing God
as glorified by such hysterically-perverted sexu-
ality ? Truly “ God ” —the God of Booth and the
Nose— does “ move in a mysterious way ! ”
From Melb. Age report of a Wesleyan globe-
trotter’s sermon :
“ For a minute or two the preacher wandered from his
subject, and, as he expressed it, ‘dreamed with his eyes
open.' . . . ‘ When I get to heaven, if my wife and chil-
dren are here I will come back and have a look at them ;
yes I’ll give one of the guardian angels a holiday, he
remarked, as though musing. ‘ And I’ll see James and
John up there,’ he continued, ‘ and I’ll say—“ How did
you fellows come to go to sleep when the transfiguration
took place ? ’ ”
This pitiable drivel actually appeared alongside
the foreign cable news in Victoria’s most widely-
circulated paper !

There is a Salvation Army “ Home'” at
Wellington, M.L.- most large towns are cursed
with a Salvarmy Home —and there the poor or
repentant woman is taken in and set to work
washing. .And for washing, starching, and ironmg
a s hirt the holy sweaters give her one penny. The
hardest and meanest private sinner generally gives
2d., and is called a fiend of iniquity for doing it,
but the Harmy gives half the sum and gets up a
reputation for charity thereon. Truly the Big
Drum covers a multitude of sin and oppression.
Maoriland law, by the way, actually exempts the
Salvation sweating dens from the operation oi the
Factories Act on the ground that they are “charit-
able institutions ”1! !
There are many curious ways of getting
killed. At Wellington (M.L.), some workmen
were blasting rock to make room for the
foundations of a new house. One
blast went off with extra energy,
and a small bit of rock went
through the bathroom window
of an adjacent house. A
young woman was standing
up in the bath, and the
rock knocked her senseless,
whereupon she fell down
in the water and pro-
ceeded to drown eom-
f ortably. Somebody
fished her out just in
time, and she is re-
covering from the
drowning, but is suf-
fering from skull-
fracture.
A reliable indica-
tion of returning pros-
perity in Melb. is the
long lines of cabs that
are to be found waiting
every early morning at
the top end of Lonsdale-
street where the local
Flossie has her beer and
habitation. A year or two
ago times were so hard
that the locality was as
moral as a church choir;
but things seem to have had
an upward tendency since,
and the writer, who passes
the spot on his way from the
office at two o’clock every morn-
ing, has watched the gradual ex-
pansion of the trade in this
neighborhood with a genial
altruism.
She was a bicycle girl,
and was wearily resting by
the roadside. He had a faint
idea ttiat he had seen her before, but
was not sure. They looked at each
other till she broke the silence.
“ Wouldn’t,” she faltered “ Beg
pardon ? ” said he. “ Wouldn’t-— ’’ she again
hesitated. “Wouldn’t what? ’ hesaid. “Wouldnt
a shandy go dandy ? ”

When a German man-o’-wars-man was
recently fined £5 for striking a Sydney policeman
a representative of the German Consulate applied
for a reduction of the penalty on the ground that
the man’s pay was only about Is. a month. At
this rate it would take over 8 years to pay the £o.
Poor Deutscher ! A fine being severe in propor-
tion to the finee’s means, 10s. would probably
meet the case.
HOW MUCH COULD HE HOLD?
SHE : “ Why don't you get married, Ted? ”
HE: “ Not silly enough yet!”
SHE : “ Goodness I how silly do you expect to get?"
Slab of humor solemnly wired from Mel-
bourne :
A meeting of ladies and gentlemen favorable to the
establishment of a foundling hospital, to be called our
Babies’ Home,” was held at the Young Women s Chris-
tian Association’s rooms to-day. There was a good
attendance.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O ! his brain was obscured in a casual eclipse
That bard who could warble: “ How sweet to recline,
And to know that I sighed upon innocent lips
That had never been sighed on by any but mine.”
For the joy of the chase—it has long been confessed—
Is the ardour that comes of a perilous run ;
It’s the risk and the rivalry give it a zest
And lend us a laurel when danger is done.
Why—it’s nothing to know that we’ve captured the Fair
With the ruby- red lips and the Juno-like eyes,
Unless there are other gallants, we’re aware,
Who would venture a neck in the noose for the prize.
For the sweetest of joys that a fond lover sips
In the arms of a maiden, all tender and true,
Is to know,—“ as he sighs on her innocent lips ”
There ore those — if they could —who would sigh on
them too !

song, so do P.D. corsets perfect the harmonies of
graceful curves and flowing outlines of the female
form divine. A pair of P.D.’s cultivates the figure
as effectively as a Marchesi cultivates the voice,
and are therefore the most invaluable aid to femi-

A WOMAN’S LETTER.
Mr D.AE Mtee,— Sjd “ 6y ' Ju ” l3 ' 1899 -
Sydney'* prize compliment to Lord Beauchamp.
A , V.°^ essor o f Bumps, in one of the Arcades, is
» chart of H:E.’s head, flanking it with
crooked-headed murderers, cross-eyed embezzlers
and baggy-mouthed orators. The artless explana-
tory note runs thusly: “ His Excellency Lord Bee-
cham shows a great development of the Bump of
benevolence, and the Bumps of Charity is also
g ai? n I ? ads us to believe that Lord
wlU take a interest in orphanage
His Ex is also a little unlucky with his Aides.
A.JJ.U Somerset, brother to the Hon. Violet
died a few days after his appointment, and now
Md throW ” fr °” * lo °* l
the dog show brought out the
usual complicated assortment of genuine dog-
lt?Z er3 ’ al^„^ any smal 'tly-frocked women ex-
wlT» ng T A hat 'l ■ dear ' dog ' oh ■ he’s-going-to-
Dite I Lord Beauchamp came out alone, with no
other support than Mr. Corkran and the big dogs.
Ihe opening ceremony was performed in a vesti-
bu,fc . was , deadened by the yelps of the hun-
dreds of insulted canines. Luckily, His Ex. put
an ° tber bric k in the brilliant reputation he is
building up on his short speeches. Reporters
who travel round to pick up the pearls, find it
rather trying to make a decorative report out of one
short sentence; but the public takes kindly to
this brevity. Five words, and the dog-show was
open.
Considering the curious, panting mob that
followed up and down the hall on his heels, I was
not surprised to see His Ex. keeping so close to
the protective bull-pups.
A dog-show offers a deliberate challenge to
many accepted feminine conventions. The
woman who is somebody out there is not the
woman who gets her frocks from Paris and her
husbands anywhere; nor the woman who leads
society with a string of diamonds; nor the woman
whose ancestors came over to Sydney with the
conquerors. Out there the only woman who is
somebody is the pale little insignificant, in a rusty
hat, who puts her hand fearlessly into a dog-ca<re
and pats her dog on the head. And the woman
who is envied by every other woman is the woman
whose hand is licked humbly by a red-eyed
mastiff. And the woman with an unimpeachable
social status is the woman who is on calling terms
with the most dogs. Every dog has his day. Also
some women have their day at a dog show.
• A f*other fete that His Ex. has promised to open
m this same Exhibition Building is the Con-
sumptive Home Bazaar. August 10th is the date
ot the opening ceremony, which promises to be
unique. The usual internal disturbances have
followed the long succession of meetings re this
Bazaar, but things seem to be straightening out
now. A fine amusement committee includes all
our leading theatrical men, and, by the joint con-
ftont of the committee itself, no women.
i'b® Press Bazaar thinks it now sees what
it is going to do. The introduction of a business-
like artist into the circle has helped to clear away
a little of the fog that always wrapped this section
like a garment. Feasible suggestions now fly
round. But I am sorry to say the Chinese
Hekald has backslidden.
An orphanage that deserves infinite considera-
tion is the Waitara Home for Foundlings a bir-
red cottage in the pure air of the North’ Shore
Line, where the little ones are tenderly cared for
if the orphanage is less discreet than those con-
tinental places with a crib on the porch that
moves automatically into the house after a child
has been placed in it, and allows the mother to
leave unobserved, it is only because its funds
are limited and its size. On all hands the
careful working of the institution is hiMfiv
commended. To help the funds, Mrs. Tom
Hughes, Miss O’Brien, Mrs. Slattery and other
ladies worked up a little dance at Paddington
Town Hall last Wednesday. Although a rush of
other attractions ensnared people who would other-
wise have gone, there .was a fair attendance, and
a better sale of tickets. Lady Darley and a party
came on later from Mrs. Hotham’s theatricals.
It was for this charity that some clever little
Chatswood girls worked up a dolly bazaar lately.
I heir charity eventuated in the front garden, and
was a pretty, childish spectacle, with all its little
girl buyers and little girl sellers. The takings of
the bazaar totted up £7.
For Amy Castles Sydney concert extra men
were put on at Plevel House to serve out seats
when the plan opened last week. Although the
concert does not come off till June 28th, there was
a wild rush for seats. They were snapped up by
the dozen and half-dozen. J
My second visit to Friedenthal’s concerts found
a house packed to the doors. Up in the gallery
half-a-dozen women crossed their knees under
great books of music, and followed the “ Moon-
light Sonata * note by note. They gave away the
impression that they played that sonata them-
selves. But it is hard to imagine what impres-
sions they took in. Moreover, Friedenthal is an
artist to,listen to, not to follow in a music-book
He has a way of making a pause last his pleasure'
and is not barbarously orthodox in the matter of
chords. At this concert, he played Schumann’s
™ Va1 ’ tbe bauntin g Chopin “Prelude in D.
■tlat, and three Grieg pieoes, and delighted
everyone with his particularly limpid touch. Of
course he used a Bechstein—a magnificent s'peci-
men—as his tour is in connection with the Bech-
stein houses.
By the way, two extra Friedenthal matinees are
to be given for the sake of students—one on Fri-
aay, one on Monday. Many pieces that everyone
knows will be interpreted, such as “The Har-
Words*” Blaoksmith >” and “Songs Without
■ th ® same evening our Salon was quite
another story under the influences of the Novel-
. Everybody spoke to everybody without
introductions. Whereas, on ordinary occasions
people don t talk even with introductions. Such
liveliness is seldom seen in the Salon. The Lady
who placarded herself with a dash, and a little
, ad, was responsible for some of the “go.” “It
looks like a bad word, but it can’t be ! ” said all the
regular Salon goers. But it was. It was Adam
Bede ! And if you wonder if that is a sample of
the Salon s ingenuity, what say you to the man
with Sydney on one coat tail and Melbourne on
another who represented “A Tale of Two Cities.”
And the madness, the frenzied persistence, with
which the craze is being chased ! Fourteen Novel-
parties go to a week just now. In America,
people dress to represent the book, which has
meaning in it, and leads to fun. Sydney writes
rCobbery on two pieces of paper, pins them
under its two arms, and asks you to guess. Or it
goes without any badge, and still asks you to
guess. Why, you might g-uess “ God’s Fool. ”
Mrs. Hotham’s theatricals drew a heavily-
dressed house to the Palace on Wednesday. The
actors were mainly well-known society people
who knew their parts and faced the footlights with
great nerve. The only drawback was that the
women elocuted chiefly on the edge of their top
notes, mistaking shrillness for distinctness. What
a rare thing is the native speaking-voice that can
steer between guttural and shriek when required
to carry ! Mrs. Hotham and Miss Elsie Austin
threw themselves into the play-“ The School-
unstress —with much spirit and un - amateurish
e ? se \ TvV erta T? ly , tkere was a weird rakish ness
about Mrs. Hotham’s last frock, with yards of
red ribbons streaming out on all sides, but other-
wise everyone looked very nice. Also in the cast
were Miss Faithfull and Miss Nellie Stephens.
For once, the men outnvalled the women. A
hardened pro. could scarcely have bettered Mr.
fxeorge LI lb born s German professor. Also Mr
Rendairs Vere was cleverly natural. Captain
Bangar was rather thoughtlessly disguised behind
a beard. I thought from the first that a little
insignificant man might have been thrown away
on that part, and thought so stiU more when a
futile attempt was made to manoeuvre the weighty
warrior through the door on a sofa.
The Season’s music is beginning to flow. First
comes “ Hommage k Beauchamp ” (Nicholson and
Co.), a downright, unmistakable title, anyway
that doesn’t pretend to be named after Lord Beau-
champ accidentally. F. R. Wynne-Jones is the
composer of this brilliant red and white valse
which is almost as glowingly colored within as
without. It will, probably, be one of the leading
waltzes of the season. Despite the awfulness of
the title, it deserves to lead, for the sway-
ing seductive movement is delightful to dance to,
and there are also snappy movements that will
lend themselves to the new hoppy style of waltz-
ing practiced by H.E., to whom the homage and
the waltz are due. “A Coon’s Sweetheart”
rather an ordinary song, by the same composer
comes from Paling and Co. Lottie Moore has
scored big successes with this ditty.
At such a time, when all music should be in-
spired by Beauchamp or Federation, George E.
Vincent’s “ Alma Polka Mazurka ” (Paling and
Co.) seems like an anachronism, and the fact 5 that
it is a polka-mazurka adds to the seeming. For
those who dance mazurkas this may be a good one
but who does dance them ? No self-respecting
programme confesses to anything more frivolous
than a polka. From Paling and Co. also comes a
new song, “The'Golden'City,” by A. C. Brillat,
which distinguishes itself from other Golden
Cities by mentioning that its walls are Phantasy.
All the others known to musical people affect to
be built of real heavenly gold. This is rather a
good song with a rippling accompaniment, cross-
hands and a distinct melody. Glen and Co. send
me another new song—“ First Love,” by G. S. de
Chanta!’ already popularised by Amy Castles in
Melbourne. A picture of Amy in a sailor blouse
and her hair down, and a firm backhand signa-
ture, embellish the cover of the otherwise cheap
little song.
In “Sons of Britannia” from Paling and Co.
composed by John H. Nicholson, all the injunc-
tions fitting to the cause—Help ye the Helpless,
btrike for the Right, and so on—are set forth to a
strain that might remind good people of a Sankey
song. And yes—here comes another Federal
Mnse, Ihe Star of Australia,"’ a Federation
song from J. Walch and Sons, Hobart. It took
two men to hoist this star: John G. Burn and
** ■H. Dawson. And again the usual sentiments
ar ®. helped out with a religious style of tune,
which I take to mean that I ederation invariably
rouses “those finer feelings” in the musician’s
breast.
There was a nice little tea-party at the new Art
Depot last week, with the Misses Wyndham and
Woodward as hostesses. This is the newly-started
depot, you will remember, that sells women’s work
on a commission basis. I saw some lovely specimens
of work scattered round—all kinds of handicraft,
trimmed hats, paintings, afternoon tea-cloths,'
waiting to be sold. The party was chiefly girlish
—Miss Grace Noble, Miss See, Miss Slattery,
MissTolly Hordern, and others. Louise Hepner,
the Belle of New York, who was one of the guests,
revealed a broad but fetching ’Murkan accent as
she discoursed in a sprightly way of the awful
ii ln ? S we sa .y * n Australia. The company gener-
ally had an idea that it was the other way, but
some of our slang, as translated by Miss Hepner
into ordinary American meanings, must hit
Americans almost as hard as their slang hits us.
Unfortunately, I can’t give examples (they are too
broad for narrow print like this) but nobody who
listened to the gay conversationalist will ever
forget what not to say to a Yankee.
A band of devoted Sydney women have leagued
together to help the Federal cause. Singularly
enough, they are all wives of ardent Federalists :
Ihe Mayoress, in the chair; Mrs. Barton, Mrs
Wise, Mrs. John See, and Mrs. Meeks, vice-
presidents ; Mrs. Herbert Harris, treasurer. The
league proposes to work for Federation in a quiet,
subterranean way; a sensible scheme, and much
more liable to assist than a campaign of women
speechmers.
Nothing new at the theatres this week. “ The
Laars has been drawing splendidly at the Royal.
Indeed, the last matinee was a record matinee
house Everyone is talking about the frocks in
1 relawny of the Wells,” which goes on next
Saturday. 1 hear that the skirts are very wonder-
ful, very wide, and the ladies of the co. are
feverishly practising the art of sitting in a
crinoline and keeping the frock down in front—
a thing that requires hard practice. One member
ot the co. has been rushing all over Sydney for
green gloves to go with a green costume. At time
of writing, these were not to be had for love or
money, and she was thinking of painting a pair of
white ones green.
I saw a simple but very effective cape at the
roughs, the other night. It reached to the
knees, and was built upon seven flounces of sea-
blue moonlit cashmere on a dark mauve silk
mmg. Many rows of silk machine-stitching
trimmed the flounces finely, a high collar stood
out to show little overlapping lace frills within
and a long scarf to the feet of blue mousseline de
soie studied with tiny mock amethysts, finished
this dream up delightfully.
At the “Belle of New York,” on Saturday,
Charles Kenmngham sat in a box and watched
Wallace Brownlow m his just-vacated part.
Brownlow fresh from the wild West, exhibited a
muscle and boisterousness that kept upsetting the
company, and put the house into an uproarious
mood, ivenningham sent down a bouquet. When
Brownlow reached for it, it jumped away over
his head. Next time it came down, the Lunatic
made a rush, and bit right through the cord with
his teeth, just to show he was a lunatic. Brown-
iow is the third man who has been put into this
Pa ,i L V- i r i ev - en h , e could n’t make it go without the
aid of little incidents like the above. Considering
that the Lunatic has the only part in the play, I
thought he might have let Brownlow bite the
string.
Mrs. Theo Winning has sent me a bottle of
melon jam made by herself from her much-sought-
after recipe The jam is a dream, and explains
why the little cookery-book should go into a
second edition so quickly.
Writes my Melbourne correspondent: —
“Governor Brassey now has four aides—Lord
Hl ? aV IP ’ L °M d Rlchard Nevill, Mr. Pakenham,
and Mr. Cecil and the result is a shocking waste
of energy—the only thing that ever gets wasted at
Grovernment House. The gallant four buzz about
like flies on a widow-pane, apparently not knowing
what to do, where to go, or how to manage any-
thing. Lord Nevill is fairly useful, of course, for
the wan identity has had experience, and is not
without tact, but the others seem to spend most
of their tune running to the 1 old hand ’ in search
of instructions. Everybody is agreed that it was
a mistake to let Capt. Wallington retire from the
service. The placid, unruffled calm of that diplo-
matic person, his waxen official smile, and his
way of saying non-committal nothings in the most
satisfying manner in the world were the makings
of Lord Hopetoun’s success. Capt. W., if allowed
a tree hand, might even have popularised the pre-
sent reign.
“Lord Hindlip is a pale, narrow-shouldered,
unkissable-looking young man, who appears to feel
lost for the present. However, a lord of any kind
is pretty sure to grow out of that in the course of
time.
A suburban Mayor gave an extra-smart
official hop, t other night, with Brasseys, etc., as
special attractions. For some time beforehand
you couldn t find a house to let thereabouts.
Population crowded across the boundary lines
from the outer darkness of surrounding ‘ shires ’
unfavored in the matter of Mayoral allowances
balls and sich.
“Due in Melbourne shortly are the Earl and
Countess of Huntingdon. The earl is only 31. He
belongs to one of the real old lordling families—
his title dating from 1529, so that if you stick a
pin into him blood should trickle out of the color
of Reckitt s blue. His family is chiefly notable
however, because one of the women of it founded
the Countess of Huntingdon connection, a reli-
gious body still somewhat numerous in England.
He and his wife are simply coming on a holiday
jaunt, and not m order to attach themselves to
any gubernatorial push.
“A gilded johnny, with a pronounced weakness
for the smiles of ‘ other fellows’ girls, ’ is said to
have met his match lately in a smart young
matron, one of the very Naicest, and a relative
of an Australian Governor. The bachelor
admirer begged permission to present his new
goddess with a souvenir—some little trifle in
the way of jewellery—and she was graciously
pleased to intimate that he might send it along.
Johnny rushed off to the jeweller, and, having
selected a liberal assortment of costly articles for
the lady to choose from, sent them along with his
card. Next day he received a charming little
note, thanking him for his lovely presents. The
grateful recipient had chosen to keep the lot.
“ Mount Morganaire D’Arcy and his bride (ex-
Mrs. Nutting, nee Boucicault) are to live in the
London residence formerly occupied by Georgians*
Countess of Dudley.
“Some dogs have their day. When the new
Mrs. D’Arcy’s dead-and-gone-pa edited Rock-
hampton Argus, the family were as poor as the
family of the typical editor, or even poorer; but
even at the lowest tide they kept a stiff upper lip,
ignoring most of their fellow-townsfolk as no-
bodies, though Mr. D’Arcy and his first wife (then
Rockhampton residents) and the Archers were
amongst the few favored exceptions. A northern
fruiterer who grumbled at a daughter of the B.
clan for propping her Trilby on the ledge of his
shop-window while she leisurely tied her shoe-
lace, was told haughtily that had she chosen
to use his head as a footstool, he should have
considered himself highly honored. Later on,
when Melbourne’s chief dressmaker tried to bounce
Mrs. Nutting into paying for a race-gown of
faulty fit, the doughty debtor let the case go into
court, drew tears from magisterial eyes by dis-
playing her dear little waist in the hateful em-
brace of a wrinkled bodice—and won her point.
“That day defendant’s mother, Mrs. Bouci-
cault, was in court—the stateliest of old ladies, and
m her day a Sydney belle. She was sister of Charles
Clarke, a byegone Bananaland gold commissioner,
still represented in the northern province by his
descendants, the Ted Shaws of Diamantina Gates.
Soon after his marriage, editor Boucicault took
his wife ’Ome to see if her beauty and his theatri-
cal connections could help her to a stage success.
The devoted pair soon came back to Australia.
To the end of his life poor old A. L. 8., of the
velveteen jacket and Bedford cords, maintained
(1) that not one of his four more-or-less dashing
daughters could hold a candle to her mother; (2)
his eldest girl had refused three governors; (3) he
himself would have died rich, had he been born
north of the Tweed.
“A she-surgeon, called in hot haste from the
recent ’Varsity hop, tied an apron over her satin
ball-gown and operated on a man’s leg. At said
function, girl-graduates, as usual, looked less
beautiful than brainy. The handsomest lady
student ever entered at Melb. ’Varsity is said to
have been Miss Katie Renniek, M.A. Her Arts
course finished, Miss Renniek accepted an appoint-
ment at Brisbane Girls’ Grammar School and went
north, where she met and married a lawyer.
“Private letters from Paris say that Mme.
Marchesi—who, by the way, is looking very frail
—thinks highly of Regina Nagel’s voice, and says
that she has a great future before her. Australia
will soon become proverbial as a recruiting-ground
for singers for ’Ome.
“Miss Spence, the proportional-votist, has been
Spending some time in Melbourne. Her lectures
are good and brainy, but it is wonderful how she
to drag proportional voting into every-
thing- She could not speak on the Babylonian
Captivity, or the Pyramids, without finishing up
with something about electoral reform. At her
lecture on ‘ The Social Atmosphere and Crime ’
before an audience of women, the dear old lady
made everybody sit up by an allusion to the
recollections of ‘ the man I live with in Adelaide ’;
but before elevated eyebrows had had time to dis-
arrange the set of bonnets, she added, ‘ who is
eighty years of age. ’ That, of course, made all the
difference. The recollections of the old gentle-
man merely concerned bull-baiting and cock-
fighting in England.
Ihe cacchinative bachelor Chief-Secretary is
at last adapting himself to the usages of Society
and the dress of the Gilded. His Apollo collar is
a nightmare of the past, so also is the farmer’s
broad Sunday tie. The one and only Peacock
now takes on fine plumage, wears a frock suit,
‘ Geisha ’ tie, and all. There surely must be a
woman in the case.
Y ours affectionately,
GOULI-GOULI.

PERSONAL ITEMS.
It was Masonry that made Way a baronet.
According to a N.S.W. personage knighted
not so very long ago, the pronoun “ you ” haß a
plural form—“ yous.” _
James M‘Govan, whose stories of Edin-
burgh detective-life are so well-known, is now
attached to the Sydney deteotive-force.
Lygon-street, Carlton (Melb.) contributes
its little mite of adulation to the new N-Sj-W.
Governor in the “Beauchamp” Ham and Beef
Shop.
A Sydney newspaper rejected a proffered
artiole, the other day, detailing a list of the re-
versed judgments of an occupant of the Supreme
Court Bench. The paper feared attachment for
contempt.
The story goes that a more-or-less recently-
bebaubled Australian, whom most people took to
be a bachelor, was really a widower. He was, it
is said, married many years ago, and now has a
son at an English university.
Mr. GEO. GORDON, “the Firm’s” scenic artist,
who died on Monday at Melbourne, as the result
of an accident.
E. P. Nesbit slowly recovers his practice
at the S.A. Bar, and no doubt will get a big
shove-on by the warm praise which that good
judge of defences, Boucaut, lately bestowed on his
handling of a local will-case.
Premier Reid says he months ago recom-
mended Mayor Harris to Gov. Hampden for a
title. That is all right, but what about three
other would-be notabilities who were similarly re-
commended but have got “no forrader ” ?
Capt. Russell, leader of M.L. Tory party,
at a Thames meeting: “ Ladies and gentlemen,
where does the Premier’s surplus come from?
Ladies and gentlemen, it comes out of your own
breeclies’-pockets.” Then the men guffawed, and
150 ladies fried in their own blushes.
Ben Tillett and Randall, Queensland im-
migration touts, should be quarrelsome bedfellows
in London. Randall’s bogeys are Socialism and
Radicalism. Not so long ago he publicly an-
nounced that Queensland doesn’t want any immi-
grant who would read Reynolds’s Newspaper.
Chief-Justice Way’s baronetcy comes to
him after at least 10 years’ waiting. It is stated
that his ambition is to receive a baxony and a seat
in the Lords. Way is, however, in very delicate
health as a result of his recent serious illness, and
he would probably be satisfied with the Federal
Chief-J usticeship.
That brainy lawyer, John Dennistoun
Wood, who, 40 years ago, was Vic. Minister of
Justice, has just been elected a municipal coun-
cillor at Both well, Tas. He is now very, very old,
but there was a time ! Away in the sixties, he
whaled C. E. Jones for writing about him in Col-
lingwood Observer, and paid the £lO fine like a
man.
Tasmanian Premier Braddon says that
whatever fight he has in him (at a pinch he is as
full of fight as a cartload of wild cats) he got from
his mother, who was a Limerick woman and the
lineal descendant of one of the women who carried
ammunition to Sarsfield at the siege, and threw
bricks from the wall-tops at Ginkell and his crowd.
This month the Premier is 70 years of age.
Ex-District Court Judge Dowling, who is
80 vears of age this year, arrived in N.S.W. with
his” father (Chief Justice Dowling) 71 years ago.
He has been 53 years at the Bar, and just 50 years
ago was made Judge Advocate General at Port
Curtis by Mr. Gladstone. Judge Dowling was one
of the last to see Sir John Franklin in the flesh.
He was in London when Franklin left for the icy
North, and he exchanged greetings as the navi-
gator’s ship moved off.
Melb. Age is very severe upon the late
James Service for his economy even in death
The ex-Minister, whose estate far exceeded
.£200,000, left nothing to public charity, and gave
special directions to his executors that any sur-
plus provisions which happened to be in his house
at the time of his death should be retained in the
family circle. ,
J. F. A. Rawlinson, Gov. Gormanston s
secretary (who was educated by Card. Newman at
his Birmingham school), is now touring Australia,
and putting up at the Govt. Houses in turn, dur-
ing the absence on leave of his chief. Mr. Raw-
linson has sporting proclivities. He rented
Chokebore, and ran him in last Hobart Cup, but
the brute didn’t win.
The fine philosophical leaders (with a tinge
of religion in them) which the Melb. Age has
been 'publishing for a few weeks on Saturdays,
are from the pen of Alfred Deakm. What with
H. H. Champion’s biting epigrammatic style, and
DeakinV fine, nervous English, the Age leading
columns are sometimes as brilliant as anything in
modern daily journalism.
Chief Secretary Peacock told a Melb.
Pleasant Sunday Afternoon crowd how, in his
youthful days, he gave up studying at the Uni-
versity because his father had got into financial
difficulties, and toiled as a grocer’s assistant from
7a m. till as late as midnight on Saturday. Pea-
cock didn’t spoil the yarn by adding— m ordinary
play-actor style—that he sat down upon his basket,
one cold winter’s night, and vowed to pass a Shops
and Factories Act if ever he got into Parliament.
At John Norton’s recent Gosford meeting
his matter and manner —to the surprise of his
hearers —savored so much of the pulpit that at the
conclusion of his address instead of applauding
the audience waited with bated breath and bowed
heads, and a still, small voice was heard— Pro-
nounce the benediction, brother I “i a
newly-made father made his way to the platform
and paralysed King Jackyby asking when he could
make it convenient to call round and christen the
babe !
J. W. Hackett, M.P., barrister and news-
paper proprietor, of Perth (W.A.), first settled in
Melbourne. He landed from Dublin 25 years ago,
and brought letters to old J udge Molesworth,
before whom he appeared a few times ; but he
failed to prosper at the Vic. Bar. The University
befriended him better. But, when Westralia
shook off the Crown shackles, John W. went
there and took up land. The Hacketts were
big people in the -Irish Church before Gladstone
knocked it on the head.
Thus choicely John Norton, “open-
lettering ” the new Governor :
I find the task of thus publicly corresponding with you
so pleasant that I run on heedless of time and space.
This letter already exceeds its legitimate length. There-
fore I must postpone my proposed dissertation on the
disgraceful regime of that BIRTHSTAINED, libidinous
lecher, Sir Charles Fitzroy and his two conspicuously
worthy sons and competitors in lust and common con-
cubinage, until another issue.
Where’s John maundering to ? What has all this
dirt to do with Earl Beauchamp ? If his Ex. s
tastes inclined to obscene literature, he could get
plenty of it without having it heaved at him under
pretence of addressing him in his public capacity.
Calmly Nortonian, also, is John’s assumption that
bombarding the Governor with rigmarole is
“corresponding” with him.
“ H.E.M.” : Was at Govt. House (British
Papua) one night when Gov. Macgregor was tell-
ing a yarn about a prisoner (a murderer), who
jumped out of a boat in which he was being
taken to the s.s. Merrie England. The cor-
poral’s cartridge jammed in his rifle, and he
could neither draw it out nor shove it in, so
he (Gov. Mac.) had to fire at the escaping
prisoner himself. “And did you hit him,
sir?” asked Captain C.—-—. The old
Governor gave the captain a look of
withering scorn, and replied, “ I neevar
meosed a mon at ten yards in me life.”
Ex-Mayor W. Smith, who died
at Collingwood the other day, was a
partner in building and contracting
with Charles .Tardine Don, the first
laborist who got a seat in Vic. As-
sembly, in the early sixties. Don was
the member who said he represented
the “purloins of Collingwood,” and
who declared he’d “drive the squat-
ters across the Murray with their
own stockwhips.” When Don died (a
widower), Smith kept and reared his
young ohildren. Afterwards, they
were sent home to relatives in Scot-
land. In the meantime, landlord
Snadden, at the Buck’s Head, Fitz-
rov. took charge of a valuable gold
watch which had been presented to C. J.
Don by political admirers. When Don s
eldest son came of age he revisited Victoria,
and his father’s watch was handed to him at the
Buck’s Head by Presbyterian Minister B. Hamil-
ton, in the presence of the Smiths, Snaddens,
Kidneys, and a select company of Scots and
whisky-bottles.
From an Adelaide paper :
Mr O A. Oox, representing London capitalists, has
taken up 340 sq. miles of country near Charlotte YVaters,
with the object of establishing a goat farm. The skins of
thp animals are to be used in glove-making.
Twenty-five years ago “Charley” Cox was law-
reporter for Melb. Age, but eventually, conclud-
ing there was “ no money ” in the press, set up as
a skin-merchant. He went on and did well, and
became a well-known “city man’’-and now he
is to be a king over 340 sq. miles of territory with
a dense population of nannies and billies.
WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR IT, OF COURSE.
REV. HORSLEY: “ This horse you sold me, Mr. Brown, as perfectly sound, is indisposed in his
front legs—he was on his knees three times yesterday. ”
MR. BROWN: “ Yes; ’e’s what you call a praying ’orse. I saved him up for you on that
account. Just think what an ad. it would be to see ’im on ’is knees outside
the church while you’re preaching !”
Just prior to the elevation of a certain
lawyer to the bench —from which he was forced,
by newspaper reports of proceedings in his court,
to resign—he was seen in one of the corridors of
the court buildings surrounded by a number of
criers and messengers, who were being invited to
feel the solidity of the calf of his leg. Still the
Crown Law authorities, in their stupidity, wanted
to make him a Judge.
De Bomford, who was incarcerated 20
years ago for shooting his sister-in-law in Tas-
mania, has just been released. After his arrest
he appeared mad—found some feathers in his cell,
and, at inspection time, was found blowing them
about in the air ; the jury brought in a “ Queen s
pleasure ” verdict. His friends were passing rich.
For 20 years he has had private apartments at
the invalid depot near Hobart, where tie received
male and female visitors in a magnificent wine,
cake-and-cigarette style. Told, as evidence of his
temper, that once, many years ago, the bailms
seized his live stock, among them a favorite pony.
To block the seizure he shot the pony dead, lhe
bailiffs then left, suddenly.
“ Yarra Yarra,” one of the finest stations
in Riverina, was first taken up and stocked by
Father Therry, the first Arch-Priest of Sydney
and founder of St. Mary’s Cathedral. Bather
Therry knew the points of good cattle, and his
brands were a guarantee
in their day. He sold
the station for .£20,000,
most of which cash he
put into the building of
old St. Mary’s.
THE RETORT DISCOURTEOUS.
BENEVOLENT ONE : “My boy, why do you smoke
that horrid pipe? ”
IMPERTINENT ONE : “ Well, you see, matey, it s
this way—I was so ’ard ’it by the bustin' of the
land-boom that I 'aven’t bin able to afford a
good cigar since!"
Henniker Heaton, it is announced, “de-
clined a birthday honor.” What sort of honor
the cable doesn’t say, but The Bulletin presumes
that Henniker was offered an earldom and held
out for being made Duke—probably of Woolloo-
mooloo.
That ex-Melb. Metropolitan Fire Brigade’s
official is said to be living in luxury on the
Brigade’s money in Honolulu. Now that Ha,wau
is part of the U.S. the fugitive can be extradited,
and sundry detectives and law-officers are urging
the Brigade to “put up the stuff.” Govt, is
willingto go halves in the expense, but the Brigade
remembers the bill for extraditing Butler and
shakes its head, and prefers to let the free and
glorious U.S.A. keep the dear departed.
The other day Vic. J ustice Hood turned
up on the bench with a peculiar kind of wig, a
sort of cross between sheep-skin and horse-hide ;
not unlike the front part of Will Whitburn’s dog a
dress in the De Rougemont skit. It seems that
Hood’s pet cockatoo or prize pup got hold of his
wig and breakfasted off it. Judge’s wigs are
not made in Victoria and, consequently, Hood,
J., is forced to appear in a temporary struc-
ture while the real thing goes to England for alter-
ations and repair.
That fluent brewer Nicholas Fitzgerald has
sat in the Vic. House of 48 Rich Landlords and
obstructed democratic legislation for 28 years.
He is now the oldest-established obstructionist in
the Chamber, and hopes were entertained that his
long continuance in one place, and the number of
things he had helped to prevent, and the solid
manner in which he hadn’t done anything, would
have been recognised by his gracious sovereign
last month. But, somewhow, Nicholas the Beer-
monger was overlooked.
The Catholic Press man, one of the
youths who sate constantly at the feet of Parkes:
The Parkes Government recommended Mr. Barton for
knighthood twice, but somehow it never came off. ‘‘l
can never understand why they ignored our recommenda-
tion of Barton,” Parkes used to say. “It seems they are
very well informed in Downing-street.” Sir Henry used
to say that the reason why he was not made a baronet or
raised to the peerage was because Varney was his eldest
son, and Varney could not uphold the dignity.
What a modest, amiable old man he was !
Tas. Parliament now boasts two broguey
men —Launceston barrister M. J. Clarke (a Federal
Convention delegate), and Gaffney, the new
member for Lyell. A verbatim chip from the
latter’s maiden spache:
Take the dooty aff the mate fer th’ poor warrikin
miners, and aff th’ butther and th’ ba-acon. If. yez tink
de miners is prosperous yez cuddent do betther than
chansre places wid ’em awhile, an’ see how fat y?z ud get
on shteak at ninepince and tinpince the pound.
Memories of a sensational Adelaide insur-
ance conspiracy case, just upon 20 years old, were
revived t’other day by the death of one of the
principals—a most popular professional man who
stepped out of prison into a carriage provided by
his then wealthy father-in-law, and so was taken
back to his old practice. In the couple of years
or so the practice had pretty well gone to pieces;
but he battled most pluckily, never quitting the
suburb where it all happened, and deserved some-
thing better than to die while still under 50.
“ M‘G.” : “ Steele Rudd’s” “ Dad,” who
had not been to town for 40 years, is scarcely less
enterprising than old Pat Nihill, a West. Melb.
milk-vendor, who died a few years back. Pat.
arrived in Melb. in the goldfields days, when all
the population was gathered at the west end, and
from that day until his demise in ’92, he never
went south of Bourke-street or east of Elizabeth-
street, except to cross the latter thoroughfare on
Sundays on his way to St. Francis’ church.
Nihill lived through the days of the Exhibition
without knowing more of it than the shadowy
dome a mile away, and Australia outside the
bounds of West Melb. was a sealed book to him.
The recent reported offer of theM.L. Chief-
Justiceship to solicitor H. D. Bell, stirs again the
old wish of certain Sydney solicitors to have their
branch remembered in appointments to the
N.S.W. District and Supreme Court Bench. On
no equitable ground is the present N.S.W. system
of limiting such appointments to members of the
Bar intelligible. A solicitor of a few years’ stand-
ing may at present drop the lower and claim
admission to the upper branch ; the barrister may
similarly change his clothes and his outlook—thus
practically demonstrating that one profession is
as good as the other. Yet a barrister may be
called on any day to act as a Judge, whereas a
solicitor may not. The anomaly is sufficiently
patent to call for removal without controversy.
But all the same, it stays. “It stays,” said a
cadaverous, horse-haired individual the other day,
“ because of the disreputable characters of most
of the six-and-eightpennies. The judgment-seat
must be kept above suspicion.” There may be
something in that.


Medical item
Dear Bulletin. —Can’t you suggest some simple remedy
for our doleful friend, “ Disconsolate Tabitha” (or Sydney
D.T.)? The principal symptoms of her complaint seem
to be(1) A Pilcher meeting with overwhelming vote
against the Bill. (2) A Heydon-Dibbs meeting and unani-
mous vote against the Bill. (3) A MacLaurin meeting
most extraordinary and enthusiastic. (4) A Carruthers
meeting disclosing a scene of wild disorder and interrup-
tion. (5) A Barton-Reid meeting, wherein the demons
of rage and despair are let loose. I fancy it is a compli-
cated case of blind staggers and nightmare, aggravated
by intermittent housemaid’s knee.
Of the many applications of Science to every-
day life which are now looked upon as necessary to com-
fort and enjoyment, probably there is none which claims
a greater share of attention than that which is called
“the black art”—to wit, photography. The use? to
which it is put in commerce alone are so varied that it is
well nigh impossible to find the trade, art or profession
which is not in some way under obligations to the camera
and lens. The number of people who follow photography
either as a business or a pastime is ever on the increase,
while to meet their wants is the constant aim of quite an
army of inventors, specialists and dealers. Occupying a
prominent position among such is the well-known firm of
this city, Harrington and Co., Ltd., whose particular aim
is to supply the thousand and one articles which are at
some time or other required by photographers. Their
stock contains everything new, interesting and useful in
the photographic trade, and should be inspected by any-
one who thinks of commencing this interesting pursuit,
as well as by the experienced worker who is up to the
numerous wrinkles in vogue amongst the “ knights of the
camera.”*

PUBLIC NOTICE.
The Bulletin proposes to drop the weary subject
of Federation so far as next issue is concerned.
Correspondents are hereby informed that Federa-
tion paragraphs sent in next week won’t be used.
This paper goes to press on Tuesday evening, just
before the result of the Referendum will be
known, and owing to its habit of coming out in
three capitals on the same day, it doesn’t reach
the public eye till Thursday morning. Therefore,
at time of going to press next week the staff won’t
know whether to whoop over a great victory, or
to explain that the defeat isn’t really so bad as it
looks, and (as J. Want did at last Referendum)
that the fact of the biggest vote being on your
side really proves that the people are on our side.
The Bulletin has an impression that Premier
Reid fixed the Referendum for a Tuesday, instead
of the much more convenient Saturday, out of
premeditated malice, and for the express purpose
of making The Bulletin “feel bad.”
A Musical Prodigy.
Master Fritz Garl Muller, whose likeness is
here printed, was born at Goerlitz, in Prussia,
and left Germany when two years old, since liv-
ing in Melbourne—for the last nine years. He has
developed into a fine, strong-looking lad, with an
artist’s passion for music. He is the son of Frie-
drich Ferdinand Muller, of Kew ; is 11 years o’d,
and has a brother (aged 8) and a sister of 10. His
first idea of music came to him from the Salvarmy
band, when he was four years old. Following in
the footsteps of his elders, he started a boys’
Salvation Army, the members of which he
called together by aid of drum ; and to these
he delivered short addresses or sang German
songs, frequently attracting large crowds, who
listened to the gifted youngster with great inte-
rest. But all this was dropped when serious
study began to take up his time, and his marvel-
lous talent for music really demanded careful
training. Already it is a rare treat to listen to
this little lad as he plays difficult pieces and
charming compositions of his own, really making
the piano speak. He has a beautiful, long-fingered,
singularly flexible hand, which gives a firm grasp
and yet can play the lightest passages most deli-
cately. Fritz is the pupil of Miss Burkett, of
Collins-street, Melb., and he certainly does her
teaching very great credit. There is a movement
on foot to get young Muller to Europe, so that he
may study under leading masters. For that
reason it is proposed that he should give concerts,
and, if possible, thus raise the needed funds.
Despite partial rains in various localities,
Western N.S. W. as a whole is still groaning at the
feet of ruthless King Drought. One squatter has

THE AUSTRALIAN GEM TRADE.
H. Newman, the well-known jeweller of 175
Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, is the largest buyer
of opal in Australia, and opal miners will find it
to their advantage to send their opal direct to
him. The firm has a reputation for straight deal-
ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. 11. Newman is also a
buyer of all other Australian gems. *
Federation—yes or no. Has Germany to
have Samoa with Mataafa as king—or shall we
Federate with America ? Malietoa Tanu would
be happy if he knew a shipment of “ Zetz ” Spa
Water has been specially ordered for the fleet—
who all say “ Zetz ” is the correct water to mix
with any stimulant, or drink by itself. “Zetz”
kills urie acid, aids digestion, and is nature’s
true regulator. The password for good health is
“ Zetz.” Plump for “ Zets.”*

Good old Blanky has lately been on its
trial at ’ome. Recently at Blackburn (Lancashire)
Police-court a man who had used “ blanky ” was
charged with obscene language. Counsel for
defence denied that the word was obscene, and
argued that it was merely a corruption of the
anoient oath “By’rLady.” This phrase, counsel
averred, had long lost its original meaning, and
had become the adjective generally used by the
lower classes to express either admiration or eon-

Perkins was the new manager sent up to
Yancomindah Station by the mortgage co. Pie
was a good accountant ; and they did say he had
once seen sheep being driven to market. He was
going to exercise economy—that was his first,
second, and third instruction ; also the last. A
sheep was killed ;he would take the leg—the rest
could go to the hut. The second leg was nearly
finished ; and, as he had notified that no beast
was to be slaughtered without his permission, it
was intimated that another sheep must die.
“Why?” “ Out of mutton !” “Eh? I’ve only
had two legs—who’s had the others ? ” And then
it was explained that the breed out there was
peculiar ; owing to the drought, or something, the
sheep, though still four-footed, produced only a
couple of legs of mutton. And now Perkins has
written the directors advising that a few sound
wethers be got to bring the flocks up to the old
standard.

grazes a cow which has justly achieved a reputa-
tion as an eccentric mother. Her latest feat is a
five-legged bull calf. In place of an ordinary left
hind-leg, the animal has two, both perfectly
formed, though one is slightly shorter than the
other. Previous to this the bovine matron gave
birth to a three-headed calf, which could drink

“ A.A.A.” : “Ferdinand’s” experience
with the grasshopper in the horse’s ear (B. 13/5/’99)
recalls an oM northern horse-dealer’s trick, that
has enabled him to sell many a pronounced jibber
as a first-class “harness.” Just previous to starting
him off he would place a very long pin, head-down-
wards, in the animal’s ear, and, before the horse
would have become used to the irritation and could
remember to jib, the trial would be satisfactorily
over. Never known to fail, and is safer than the
grasshopper dodge.

_I n the Furneaux Group, where the mutton-
birds come from, they tell a story of a strong-
armed widow settleress who, with her daughter,
killed 1700 snakes in a year on one small island.

“ Dabton ” : A certain Western under-
taker is a perfect ghoul. He haunts the local
hospital waiting for the demise of persons de-
spaired of; and when one of these disappoints
him he considers himself personally aggrieved.
In one instance, having heard that the patient
would not last two hours, he hied him to the
clergyman to snap up the burying job. The latter
rebuked him for his callousness, but the “ planter”
nevertheless presented himself at the hospital as
clerically authorised, and arranged the funeral
for 3 next day. Meanwhile the man died, and
the clergyman gave the job to another under-
taker, who arranged to bury at 11, forenoon; so
that when No. 1 turned up with his hearse there
was no corpse, and the disappointed one, after
“performing” a bit, was fain to drown his
chagrin in whisky.

“U.”: Some bushwhackers don’t trouble
about trifles. Was once talking to one in Gipps-
land, when he stooped, picked a. handful of bloated
ground-leeches out of his socks, casually threw
them away, and went on talking in entire in-
difference to a huge swamp-fly boring at the base
of his nose. When I drew his attention to it, he
shot out his under-lip and blew upwards, making
the fly merely transfer operations to his neck.
Knew another that used to slumber peacefully in
a tent that swarmed with soldier-ants with bills
on them like tomtits.

Yarrum : Re snake-sounds :
One night, at Bungonia, was talking to publican when
we heard a clear and prolonged squeak. Publican said it
was made by snake. Took a lantern and a waddy, and
we went down paddock. Hadn’t gone far before we heard
squeak again. Companion held up the light, looked
round, and presently found a big brown snake up against
a stump. Settled him, went on past stump, and almost
walked upon female snake coming towards us. Settled
her, and publican explained that the snake at the stump
had been calling for mate. He had often thus killed a
pair, he said. Sound was very like the shriek of ’possum
being worried by dogs.
“Slab”: Be

dog (8., 29/4/’99). It
was neither instinct
nor reason, but just
pure eussedness. Two
of them went out for
sheep. Probably No.
2 was a stranger to
“W.M.F.’s” pup’s
marvellous abilities,
and had just had a
full description of
them, but when
“W.M.F.” wanted
to show some fancy
work, it didn’t come
off, and the pup made
a sort of liar of him.
Happens to every
owner of a good dog.
Have one myself
which brings the
“ killers ” in “on his
own.” Sent him to
do it t’other day, and
boasted about him to
a friend staying with
me. Sheep didn’t
turn-up. Went to in-
vestigate, and found
the whole mob
jammed in a corner,
“ M'lntyre ” keep-
ing them well in.
Grabbed him by slack
of neck and kicked to
hurt. Result, splen-
did work. Wouldn’t

but that’s another
matter for “ Abori-
ginaliars ” to spread
themselves over.

“5.0.0. J.” : Be
jewfish’snest (Bulle-

often watched the
fish, swimming round
and round for about half-an-hour, in its
nest of stones, but never saw it pause. Fancy it
must lay at night. Never saw it moving any
stones. Very numerous in Condamine River, Q.
No other fish goes near when it is circling round.

This hails from Cloncurry and is vouched
for by the local organ as true. Northern man sent
his blackboy to creek for water. Nigger returned

disembowelled him ; and found a five-foot kanga-

“N.N.8.”: The aboriginal stone axes
mentioned by “ J.A.” (B. 27/5/'99) are probably
made of diorite, which need not be a local stone,
as blacks who couldn’t get suitable material
locally used to barter with certain tribes that were
practically manufacturers, such as the Darkenung
tribe (Hawkesbury-Wollombi, N.S.W.). They had
a large quarry, called a “ mogo ” (word means
“ stone axe ”) beyond the Wollombi. Their axes,
however, were made of basalt, and, through bar-
tering, have been found hundreds of miles inland.
“Tommy J.P.” : Re swaggie, fly and
box of matches (8., 20/5/’99). Once saw an
old German exhibiting an educated blowfly
in Davoren’s P. of W. Hotel, Grenfell,
N.S.W. Charged Is. each to see the show.
Blowfly had a few dabs of paint on its tmdy
by way of uniform. German impaled'fly
on large pin stuck through piece of cork,
and as it twisted its feet in its agony he
gave it a wee straw musket, with which it
used to shoulder arms, port arms, present
arms, in the most ludicrous fashion. Then
he gave it a pair of tiny dumb-bells (straws
with knobs of cork), and it did physical
drill. The secret was that the orders
given cleverly coincided with the tortured
insect’s movements. I have never looked a
blowfly in the face since.

“ G.E.A.”: Bob and I were riding
home one moonlight night in the “ coupl-
ing” season, when snakes travel around
after dark, and presently saw a big fellow
stretched across the track, and got down to
demolish him. Bob was “fit,” and took
risks. He jumped on the reptile, and they
got badly mixed. Then there was a yell—
lie had been bitten ! Got a match and found
wound on his shin —two distinct punctures,
and we hastened back to town, where he
was “treated.” Before dinner-time the
next day the doctor pronounced the patient
“out of danger,” and we left for home once
more. Found the defunct “ snake ” hanging
over a rail. It was an eel! Then I ex-
amined Bob’s only spur, and found but
two darts on the rowel. Bob asked me, “as
a favor,” to keep it quiet, and I hereby do
so !

A pathetic spectacle in drought-
stricken N.S.W. districts is the horse that
is not reckoned worth feeding, or sending
away—the waster, or the honest old chap
who has worked hard for years and is at
last broken down and useless. The unfor-
tunate animal exists for a time on. dead
leaves, bark, &c., and at last becomes so
weak that it knows if it lies down at night
it won’t have strength to rise again ; so the
wretched creature keeps on its legs until
sheer exhaustion pulls it down—and then
the crows !
“ Paul ” : There is a Papuan snake which
whistles when disturbed or when going to bite.
Knew a Govt, official who was out shooting with
a Papuan when they heard this warning whistle,
and while they were looking up into the trees,
thinking it was a bird, the boy was bitten on the
foot, and died in 30min. This snake is black,
with white belly and white rings near tail.
Whistle represents “ hiss ” of ordinary snake.

“ F.P.” : Any reader ever seen a “ cus-
cus ” (Papuan ’possum)? Looks like cross be-
tween native bear and a ’possum ; color, white
with yellow bands on shoulders and hind-quarters.
Large round eyes, and “ring tail.” Easily
tamed.

What is the record journey for’a parson on
a marrying expedition? Without having any
data to go upon, present writer reckons that Rev.
Burton, of Norseman, ought to be in the running.
A couple of couples rusticating at Balladonia,
which is alleged to be somewhere in the Great
Cat Country between Norseman and Eucla,
couldn’t wait any longer, so Burton sprinted
across on his bike—lso miles of desert, mostly
sand. His machine broke down 14 miles from
Balladonia, and he got tired of pushing it; other-
wise, after opening the doors of the Balladonian
paradise, he had intended running across to
Eucla to see if there was anything in his line of
business there.

Some Obvious Facts.
Q , LABOR LEADER DAWSON .
Dear Bulletin. — I have been reading the
“obvious facts ” of Sydney Daily Telegraph,
and desire, in return, to present a little set of
niy own :
(1) Clause 62 of the Commonwealth Bill provides that in
the event of Federation Sydney Telegraph shall have its
telegrams from the Federal capital franked FREE, whilst
all ot her Australian papers shall be charged DOUBLE
RATES. . , ,
(2) It .is provided by clause 105 of the Bill that under
Federation the duty on Queensland sugar shall be trebled
and a bonus of £lOO shall be paid to the Colonial Sugar
Refininsr Co. for every ton of sugar made at its mills. In
arriving at this result, Dr. MacLaurin’s methods of com-
putation have (teen followed.
(3) It is provided in the Commonwealth Bill (see clause
78) that the first Ministry of the Commonwealth shall be
selected only from Doddering Idiots, Chronic Liars, Effete
Politicians, and Narrow-minded Provincialists. This
gives the anti-Bill party AN ABSOLUTE MONOPOLY.
(4) The population of Australia at the last census was
7 343 6364, of which 6,326,4321 were men, 486 were old
women, and the balance of 1,426,893)4 consisted of Dr.
MacLaurin’s widow. In the event of Federation not
being carried, the increased cost per head will be £7 2s.
6d., and the population will either become deceased or
HAVE TO LIVE ON SAUSAGES MADE OUT OF GEORGE PILE’S
Dog. Therefore, vote FOR the Bill.
(5) Coghlan’s statistics show that during 1898 the
Savings Bank surplus dwindled down to £154 3s. Bd. In
1892 the surplus was 1.1,432,346. (See Jones on “ How to
Cook Figures,” p.p. 17,143-4.) This clearly proves that
Dibbs either forgot to lock the safe when he went down
the street to curse Federation, or that the Telegraph
editor added up the figures. The obvious moral is VOIE
FOR FEDERATION. . .
What do the anli-Billites say in reply to these obvious
facts? They DARE NOT ANSWER THEM 1-Dorge
Gibbs.
Jawbone Neild tells the old half-truth :
“The Braddon Blot requires that £4,000,000
should be raised by the Federal Government for
every £1,000,000 it would require.” Why not tell
the whole story: “The Braddon Blot requires
that £4,000,000 shall be raised for every
£1,000,000 that would be required if the Federal
Govt, didn’t pay any interest on the public debt.
Somebody writes to
say that the Xmas pic-
nic incident told by The
Bulletin in a recent
“ Gouli - Gouli ” letter
was not unique. A
stampede of females,
clothed in nothing but
nakedness and leeches,
happened at Bullock
Creek, near Castle-
maine, in days of yore,
and one Thatcher, an
improvisatore of the
period, made it famous
in a ballad entitled
“ The Bullock Creek
Picnic.” Has anybody
an old copy of the song-
book published by That-
cher and Mulholland ?
Jock was a Geordie,
and after his recruit-
drill found himself do-
ing guard-duty for the
first time. Tired of
tramping to and fro, he
was standing easy when
an old gentleman in a
tourist’s rig passed him
at a short distance,
glared, then came back
and thundered, “Damn
you, sir ! don’t you
know who I am ? ” Jock
eyed him a moment, and then quietly resting his
carbine against the wall, thrust out his hand and
exclaimed : “ Gord’s truth, Jim, ’ovv are yer? Be-
damned if I knowed yer ! ” The old gentleman
was Colonel Spalding, and Jock did no more
guard-duty.
Pilcher, Q.C., warns the people of N.S.W.
that Federation will bring interprovincial Free-
trade, and that “will allow Victoria to swamp
us.” The unfortunate barrister is three years
behind the time. In 1896 N.S.W. abolished its
duties on almost everything which Victoria pro-
duces, and allowed that province to swamp N.S.
Wales as much as it liked. And now Federation
will abolish Victoria’s border duties, and allow
N.S.W. to swamp Victoria a little in return.
Pilcher has his facts upside-down, that’s all.
VOTE !

A fine, vigorous lie from Sydney Telegraph
the paper which will lose £5OOO a year in
extra telegraphic expenses, to say nothing of
what it may be out of pocket through the pos-
sible abolition of free newspaper postage, if
the present Bill, or any other Bill which doesn t
fix the Federal capital in Sydney, is carried
Amongst the arguments of the organ of the Blank-
jheque Party we find the following “ Even if all the six
colonies join the Federation, the two populous ones, New
South Wales and Victoria, will have about two-thirds of
the votes in the popular Chamber.” This is a deception.
The two States would have more than twice the popula-
tion of the other four, but would require five more votes
to <dve them twice the voting power, even in the popular
Chamber. But in the Veto Chamber they would have a,
clear two to one against them. At an eventual joint
sitting, with 674 per cent, of the total population, they
would hold under 64£ per cent, of the voting power, and
the “ absolute majority ” clause would step in and block
them completely. — Telegraph, 10th June.
There will be 110 votes at a joint sitting. An
absolute majority—s 6 votes, or anything over
50 per cent, of the voting power —will carry
the day. And the £5OOO a year paper solemnly
tells its readers that N.S.\V . and Victoria, with
per cent, of the voting power (59 votes out
of 110) will be defeated, and that the other four
provinces, with per cent, of the voting
power (51 votes out of 110) will win. In other
words that 51 votes are more that 59, and
per cent, is more than 54i| per cent. Is the
Telegraph a raving lunatic, or what? Even
its arithmetic about the lower House is wrong.
N.S.W. and Victoria will have 47 votes out of
74. They only want two more votes to make a
two-thirds majority.

Dear Bulletin. —He this Federal capital
question, there are several cases in point. The
United States commenced business with its Con-
gress at New York, and afterwards removed it to
the partially-built new city of Washington. This
proves, I suppose, that if the Australian Parlia-
ment first meets at Melbourne it can’t possibly
remove to a new city in N.S.W. The Maonland
capital used to be Auckland, but it was removed
to Wellington ; this also proves that you can t get
a Parliament to change its location, and if the
Commonwealth Legislature once sits m Mel-
bourne nothing can shift it. The English capital
has shifted from Winchester to London; and the
Parliament of Upper Canada used to hang out at
Niagara, though, grievous to relate, it changed
its quarters later on ; and that of Lower Canada
shifted in 1849 from Montreal to Quebec, ihese
and other painful episodes will doubtless show you
that when once a Parliament or a Government
is located comfortably anywhere (in Melbourne or
elsewhere) it is ridiculous to suppose that it will
remove. —T.S.
It is amazing how little sense it takes to
make an anti-Federal M.L.A. Witness this re-
mark of Frank Cotton in his recent Disumonist
speech at Camperdown :
The first Federal Parliament would be elected on the
existing unequal State franchise, and he had no doubt that
South Australia would obtain a very unfair advantage by
reason of the women’s franchise there doubling the number
of voters.
And it is such a simple proposition, after all.
Each province is allotted a certain number of re-
presentatives according to its population—men,
women, and children. At the first I ederal elec-
tion each State retains its present franchise. S.A.
will have seven representatives if it decides to re-
strict its franchise to men with over £lO,OOO a
year and there are only two dozen voters in the
CABBAGE-TREE JACK ON HIS TRAVELS .
whole province. It will have seven representatives
if it gives all men a vote, or if it gives all men
and all women a vote. And if it goes further, and
extends its franchise to children, infants, dogs,
goats, pigs, iguanas and cockatoos, still it will
have just seven representatives. Yet a presum-
ably sane man like Cotton, also a hundred other
anti-Federalists, can’t understand a little thing
like that.
Dr. MacLaurin, in a recent speech on the
blessings of disunion, asked why N.S.W. should
federate with a poor broken-up place like las-
mania, that had an accumulated deficit of £350,000.
And an angry voice comes from the island re-
marking that Dr. MacLaurin is an ignorant and
blatant person ; that his figures are two years old ;
that Tasmania’s shortage is now down to £12o,UOO;
and that, seeing that Dr. Mae’s own province has
a deficit of .£2,soo,ooo—twice as much per head
as Tasmania’s—he doesn’t know what he is talk-
ing about.
Auckland Herald’s corres-
pondent in Samoa indulged in some
tall writing about the war. In his
latest letter he describes a visit to
the plantation where one of the
scrimmages took place. After de-
scribing his emotions on viewing
the spot where so many heroes fell,
he goes on to observe that patches
of their pants were still visible on
the barbed-wire fence through which
they had—well —retreated.
Hobart possesses a harmless
old citizeness who imagines herself
Queen of Europe, Asia, America,
and their d pendencies ; and at-
tends all outdoor society and State
functions bedecked with red gloves,
fancy scarves, brass chains, and
Brummagem gimcracks of all sorts.
For years the old dame has been
marching round giving orders to all
and sundry, and posing as Direc-
tress-General of the Universe, but
nobody in Hobart ever says her
nay. The other day when the Gor-
manston carriage arrived at the
wharf with the departing Vice-
regal party it was met on the out-
skirts of the crowd by Premier
Braddon and one or two high offi-
cials. Lady Gormanston alighted,
greeted the officials, then slipped
round to the back of the carriage,
where the Queen of All Things
stood waiting in awful majesty,
shook the old lady’s hand, enquired
what she could do for her among
the kings and queens of Europe,
and wished her a kindly farewell.
E. J. Brady makes his cavil
at Newbolt clearer —
Though Drake was buried in a leaden
coffin, I cannot really believe Newbolt ig-
norant of a well-known historical fact
when he swings the gallant admiral to
his rest in a shotted hammock in Nombre
de Dios Bay. “ Drake’s Drum ”is writ-
ten in the Devonshire dialect, and seems
intended as a simple Plymouth lad’s song of the great
captain. It is in keeping, then, with Newbolt s treatment
that the unlettered singer should speak of Drake as
'down atween the round shot, “ waiting in his hammock
till the Great Armada comes.’’ In any case, I should not
like to say that the quality of the verses in question was
lessened by the veritable dictum of even a dozen reliable
authorities. I regard an offence against Art as more
culpable than a poetio breaoh of fact, or perhaps morals.
Newbolt, or any other writer, is “ welcome to knock holes
in mv verses,” but it must all be but as musketry-fire to
the cannon-shot with which (I believe in common with
most writers) I can always perforate my own work.
Instead of condemning Newbolt for melodiously burying
Drake in a hammock, instead of his leaden comn, I
should, with kindred feeling, be inclined for an extension
of poetio license sufficient to permit his being buried in a
hollow log, providing always that the poetic intermen
were artistic and decently metrical.
The party which asks N.S.W. in general
to reject Federation because the Bill doesn’t pro-
vide for the Federal capital being in Sydney is
really addressing the people outside Sydney thus.
The address has never been put m proper form
before, but it is time that it should be :
Fellow countrymen : There are about 670,000 of you
outside the 100-mile radius, and the Federal capital is to
be planted among you somewhere. You are requested bo
say that you are utterly unfit to have the capital among
you Also that you won’t federate unless Australia in
general recognises that you are too low and mean and
infected to have the oapital anywhere near you. You are

urged to strike for the glorious privilege of being declared
infected, and-to insist on your unfitness and general
degradation being recognised. The community which
won't strike in defence of its own right to be kicked, and
won't maintain the priceless privilege of being fired out,
is lost Fellow-countrymen, the other provinces have
declared that you are fit and worthy people to have the
capital of all Australia among you. You will have an
opportunity, on June 20, to declare, by voting against
the Bill, that you are not. You will have an opportunity
to say with emphasis that you are so degraded that you
oan’t be trusted with a capital (tremendous cheering).
Therefore rise up and demand that you be uisqual ] lied,
and defend your incapacity to the last (deafening
applause).
Secret-Caucus Labor members Holman
and Hughes are still trying to persuade them-
selves and the N.S.W. public that the alleged
‘ ‘ Secret Conference Bill ” is undemocratic. Should
that Bill be defeated, these gentlemen ought to
combine with Messrs. M‘Launn and Pilcher to
make the Constitution of N.S. W. half as demo-
cratic as the one they are opposing.

The loss of some of its more effective argu-
ments does not hurt the Cabbage-tree Mob nearly
so much as the defection of nearly all its best
speakers. Ashton is, perhaps, chief, and his elo-
quent and trenchant addresses are converting
many of those whom he helped to influence last
year. At Parramatta, last week, speaking on Dr.
MacLaurin’s 225. 6d. per head and the law
average, he remarked that the doctor reminded
him of the expert who was called in at an inquest
on a man found dead in a 7ft* hole in a shallow
lake. The witness laughed at the idea that death
was caused by drowning—“for,” said he, “the
average depth of the sheet of water is only 2ft.
That the Bill will pass is grudgingly ad-
mitted by the anti-Bill leaders, but they rely on a
faint ray of hope that the majority will be small
enough to justify them again upholding minority
rule. Jawbone Neild, who was so abusive over
the “ reasonable ” in the rivers clause, at his Pad-
dington meeting, replied diplomatically, but for-
getfully, to a query that he would support the Bui
in the Assembly if it obtained a reasonable majo-
rity at the Referendum. The audience thereupon
severely guyed the majah (now colonel), and,
driven into a corner, he confessed that, if the Bill
was successful by 10,000, it would be his duty to
assist it in its passage towards Royal assent.
The Sydney Sun-
day Shellback, moan-
ing about how the high
Federal tariff, if there
is one, will lead to
something or other,
says that a man (name
unknown) from a high-
tariff province (which
province or how far
back in the province is
not stated) bought a
bottle of camomile pills
in Sydney, price Is.
Also, he stated to some-
body (person not speci-
fied) that in his own
province (name of pro-
vince buried in gloom)
he had paid (date not
given, but perhaps 25
years ago) 2s. for a
similar bottle. And the
SHELLBACKhas grievous
doubts about Federa-
tion because of the
alleged pills of the per-
son unspecified, who is
said to have come from
the undefined place
where the Sabbath
paper says he said that
pills are 2s. a bottle.
By the way, the pills
that cost Is. in Sydney
are over 2s. in some
baok parts of N.S.W. If you compare pills in
Melbourne with pills in Milparinka you can prove
that Freetrade doubles the price.

futile effort as leader of Q. Labor-party, has been

native with a fair share of political and other
knowledge ; a ready, pungent and fluent
speaker, who knows the value of silence, and, if he
doesn’t fall asleep too often in times of crises, will
do material damage to the Boodle phalanx. He is
a specialist in mining, has dabbled in journalism,
and is neither teetotaller nor pietist. It will be in-
teresting to watch how Glassey, who has so long
led the orchestra, will now handle the big drum.

the best possible has been said for the continuance of the
large measure of public support which it has hitherto
fallen to its fortunate lot to receive.” Pleasant reading.*

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once more this Autumn-earth is ripe,
Parturient of another type.
While with the Past old nations merge
Uis foot is on the Future’s verge ;
rhey_watch him, as they huddle pent,
Striding a spacious continent,
Above the level desert’s marge
Looming in his aloofness large.
No flower with fragile sweetness graced
A lank weed wrestling with the waste.
Pallid of face and gaunt of limb,
Ihe sweetness withered out of him.
Sombre, indomitable, wan,
The juices dried, the glad youth gone.
A little weary from his birth ;
His laugh the spectre of a mirth.
Bitter beneath a bitter sky,
To Nature he has no reply.
Wanton, perhaps, and cruel. Yes,
Is not his sun more merciless ?
Joy his such niggard dole to give,
He laughs, a child, glad just to live.
So drab and neutral is his day
He gleans a splendour in the grey.
And from his life’s monotony
He lifts a subtle melody.
When earth so poor a banquet makes
His pleasures at a gulp he takes.
The feast is his to the last crumb;
Drink while he can, the drought will come.
His heart a sudden tropic flower,
He loves and loathes within an hour.
Yet you who by the pools abide,
Judge not the man who swerves aside.
He sees beyond your hazy fears ;
He roads the desert of the years.
Rearing his cities in the sand,
He builds where even God has banned.
With green a continent he crowns,
And stars a wilderness with towns.
His gyves of steel the great plain wears;
With roads the distances he snares.
A child given a world for toy,
To build a nation, or destroy.
His childish features frozen stern,
A nation’s task he has to learn.
From feeble tribes to federate
One splendid, peace-encompassed State.
What if there be no goal to reach ?
Tne road lies open, dawns beseech !
Enough that he lay down his load
A little further on the road.
So, toward undreamt-of destinies
He slouches down the centuries !

ILIOUSNESS
mas my husband brought me a box
of Bile Beans, and, more to please
him than with any idea of deriving
benefit from them, I began to take
them. In a couple of days it seemed
to me that I felt a little better, and
then, as a gleam of hope entered
my dark life, I decided to take them
regularly. Before I had finished
the contents of one box I experi-
enced a most decided change for the
better, and continued to improve
daily. At length, after I had taken
the contents of five boxes, I could
eat a hearty meal and digest it also.
The sallowness left me, I got stouter,
and now, as you see, I am in perfect
health. This result is due solely to
Bile Beans, to which I owe my life.

Influenza and Colds.
Nothing so suddenly obstructs the perspiration as sudden transitions
from heat to cold. Heat rarifies the blood, quickens the circulation, and
increases the perspiration ; but when these are suddenly checked the con-
sequences must be bad. The most common cause of disease is obstructed
perspiration, or what commonly goes by the name of catching cold. Cough..,
colds, sore throat, &c., if attended to m time are easily subdued, but, if
allowed to run their own course, generally prove the forerunner ofmore
dangerous diseases. Nine-tenths of the consumptives date their affliction
from a neglected cold, and the diseases that are caused by wet feet damp
clothes, or exposure are more numerous than are generally supposed. One
of the most efficacious medicines for the prevention of diseases of the throat
and lungs is BILE BEA.NS.
Constipation.
This is a disease which may be looked upon as the mainspring of more
than half the ills which afflict mankind. It consists in an irregular and
insufficient action of the bowels, and its commonness is remarkable, especi-
ally among women. Though there are other causes of constipation the
principal one is an irregularity of habit in attending to the laws of nature.
Insufficient liver action will also produce it. Constipation is not !° e *'
tremely difficult to cure as many people imagine. A few doses of Bile
Beans taken as directed, will effectually remove the present trouble, and,
if strict regularity of habit be joined to a course of the Beans, constipa-
tion will not, except in very occasional eases, be found to recur. Lt
member regularity is absolutely necessary to good health, and, while BILE
BEANS will be found a great help and will cure most obstinate cases of
constipation, they cannot overcome the effects of wilful neglect.
BILE BEANS are an Undoubted
Specific for Biliousness, Sick and
Nervous Headache, Indigestion,
Constipation, Piles, Female Weak-
ness, Pale-faced Girls, Irregularities,
Bad Breath, Blotches, Pimples,
Dizziness, all Liver and Kidney
Troubles, Dyspepsia, Heart Palpi-
tation, Pain in Back and Side, Ful-
ness after Eating, Lack of Physical
Tone, Heartburn, and that Tired
Feeling. Obtainable from all
Chemists and Storekeepers, or from
the Australian Depot of the Bile
Bean Manufacturing Co., 39 Pitt-
street, Sydney, post paid on receipt
of Is. l|sd. per box. Bile Beans
come within the reach of all, and
at the low price they are sold at, no
one should be without a box.

• J! 16 ™* ners must gain as consumei’s under
tins Bdl. Unexpected truth in Sydney Telegraph
of Ist June, 189'J.
Federation means the creation of mono-
polies. lhe D. 7 \’s 126th Bogey. If so, why does
that powerful monopoly the Colonial Sugar Re-
fining Co. so bitterly oppose the Bill ?
Chief Justice Madden’s appointment as
Lieut.-Governor of Victoria looks very significant
in present circumstances. It means under Federa-
tion locally-sppointed Governors for the States
of Australia.
( Federalists do not assert that the Amended
Constitution Bill is perfect; all they claim is that
lk tke mosfc democratic Constitution in the
world. And until the people of Australia go to
another and a better world they should take the
best they can get in this.
Apropos the importation of Vic. lawyer
Higgins by the Sydney anti-Billites. Far-out
Broken Hill Federalists badly wanted C.C.
Kingston to go up from Adelaide and give the
cause a shove-on there ; but he wrote a regretful
refusal. His motives would be sure to be mis-
represented, he said.
Softgoods Sargood, M.L.C., of Melbourne,
beamed recently on the people of Perth, W.A.,
and had the gall to tell them, among other good
advice and copy-book headlines:
They had a duty of their own to perform, and that was
to go to the poll. He had been engaged in politics, and
he had noticed the apathy of the electors in the other
colonies. He asked them, in justice to themselves and
their members, to be sure and record their votes.
In Sargood’s own province the people have been
going to the poll in vast numbers for years to
support every Govt, which declared for Oiie-
man-one-vote, and on Sargood’s recommen-
dation Sargood’s House of 48 Rich
Landlords has refused the popular
demand every time. But the iron-
ical big tailor tells them it is
their duty to keep on going
to the poll just the same !
As for the apathy,
however, Sargood is
right. A less-apa-
thetic province
would have
made the
House
of 48
Rich

S.A. Parliament meets June 22, and King-
ston’s following now promises to be as solid as in
last Assembly. Oppositionists are at loggerheads
over the leadership, the rival candidates being
Downer and Darling. Downer has never com-
manded solid Tory support, and the chances are
in favor of his being supplanted by his younger
rival.
V. L. Solomon displaces Downer as leader
of S.A. Opposition. John Darling, jun., who
would have been a certainty, declined the position
for private reasons. The personally-popular Solo-
mon is a good debater, and the only Oppositionist
anything like a match for Kingston in repartee.
He is the fourth successive leader elected by the
S.A. Tories since Kingston’s accession to power
m ’93.

Grlassey, though deposed, hasn’t altogether
shed the manners of a leader. When the Common-
wealth Bill was before committee of Q. Assembly
Dickson, Dawson, and Drake, the three leaders
made personal statements to the effect that all
amendments would be resisted. Then up rose
Classey and in Jus curiously-jaunty manner,
announced, I wish to say that I shall resist any
and every amendment.” J
, gnarled journalistic monstrosity,
the Brisbane Telegraph, keeps bellowing for
more bglit on the Federation question; but when
Chief Justice Griffith, a few days ago, exhaustively
and authoritatively discoursed on the subject the
crooked evening journal suppressed all mention of
the circumstance, and kept stuffing its columns
with large masses of cheap clippings. The only
soi-t of light the Cowlegraph believes in is gas-
light—at maximum rates.
Queensland labor-leader Dawson was one
of those who demanded that there should be a
minimum affirmative vote of 25,000 before Queens-
land accepted Federation. So the Northern pro-
vince saw the amazing spectacle of Premier
Dickson, head of the Boodle Ministry, fighting’
for majority rule, and the Labor-leader doing his
utmost against it. Dickson came out on top, and
for the first time The Bulletin’s sympathies are
unreservedly with the land-shark Cabinet.
The anti-Federal Frank Cotton thinks
It would be more judicious to see how far they could
go with the machinery of the Federal Council which
could easily accomplish 37 out of the 39 matters that this
13ill was designed to perform.
Curious, this sudden desire of so many
bogus Democrats to entrust large powers
to the Federal Council, where each province
has equal representation (not in one' House
only but in the whole Council, for it is all
one House), and these representatives are not
even elected by the people but are appointed by
the Ministries. Theanti-Federalistalways admires
every kind of Federation except the one available
at the moment. This is the very first time the
Cotton crowd had a kind word to say for the poor
dilapidated Council.
. According to Maoriland Opposition papers
‘‘Captain Russell has pledged himself to respect
the existing land and social laws, to prevent the
accumulation of great
estates, to reform
the Leg. Council,
to make the
Civil Service
non - politi-
cal, and to
introduce
a pure ad-
ministra-
t i o n.”
Then
which
is Oodlm ? Really, Seddon seems to have snapped
up all the originality in M.L. politics, leaving
the Opposition nothing but the dry bone of “pure
administration ” to scramble for.
April Chambers Journal, in an article on
England’s last territory-steal—the Kowloon Penin-
sula, near Hongkong—remarks that “ our recently-
acquired fellow-subjects . . . make a living where
a white man would starve . . . and may yet do
good in Australia.” J. Bull can’t forget his Aus-
traha-as-a-rubbish-tip tradition.
Australian banking laws are wailing in-
valids calling for the Federal physician. Pro-
vincial treatment makes them worse and worse.
Some provinces make the notes a first charge on
u n £ ass^s > others don’t. No two provinces
charge the same note-tax—some charge none at
all. Queensland has taken over the bank note
issue and made it a State affair. Victoria has a
law which requires that certain important' par-
ticulars shall be shown in the published balance-
sheets, but no other province has followed its wise
example. The note for which was paid £1 in the
province of issue is only worth 19s. Gd. across the
border. All these things will be made uniform
under Federation. “ One nation, one flag, one
destiny is only half the story. “ One bank-note,
one postage-stamp, one postal-note” is another
feature well worth remembering.
WEAKENING TO THE INTELLECT.
JIM (to Bill): What the dooce is wrong with
Jack to-night?"
BILL : "'E's drinkin’ soft stuff, an’ ’e can’t argue
a hit.”
Q. Premier Dickson, in making his Federal
Enabling Bill a non-party question—and thus in-
citing every form of opposition—manifested both
apathy and cowardice : apathy for the cause of
i ederation and fear of his three anti-Federal
colleagues, Barlow, Gray and Chataway. Dick-
son fears to tamper with his Cabinet in ease the
thing falls in on him. An intelligent and spiney
premier would have gleefully seized the chance of
getting rid of the three dead-weights named.
That bogus Liberal, Groom, M.L.A., it is
wired, “maintains the right of Queensland Par-
liament to amend the Federal Constitution Bill.”
Of course it, or any other Parliament, has a right
to amend the Federal Constitution Bill as much
as it pleases. Nobody disputes that. The only
trouble is that when it has amended the Bill there
will be no Federation; the only way there can be
a J ederation is by all the provinces accepting
the same Bill. Queensland will have to amend
Groom.
Premier Kingston definitely announces
that, if S. A. Leg. Council again rejects the House-
hold buffrage Bill, Parliament will be immediately
dissolved. This comes as a surprise to Tories, who
have repeatedly taunted the Govt, with being
afraid to again appeal to the people. With house-
hold suffrage 104,000 electors would secure the
franchise . for the Council. As Kingston indig-
nantly points out, S. A. has been governed for the
last five years by 47,000 people—the minority of
Assembly-electors who possess the extra property-
vote for the Council.
Ex-Opppsition-leader Lyne is about the
most forlorn politician in N.S.W. just now. He
could not soar beyond a series of barren fights
against Premier Reid for office. Barton displaced
him as Opposition leader and Lyne became a
dissatisfied soul with increased leanings toward
provincialism. When he sulked in silence nobody
troubled him for guidance. And when he did
announce himself, it was again too late, for new-
ohum MacLaurin had jumped the leadership of
the Disunion-at-any-Price party. A man who
can miss two chances such as those in six months
is a hopeless case.
Last year the farmers in Tas. Assembly
fought as one enraged cookie against any reduc-
tion Of the Stock Tax, and the House of Landlords
was . only induced to agree to a three months’
abolition of the Tax under threat of a public
rising of meat-consumers. But although the Tax
has been in operation since Dec. last, the shortage
of meat in the island has gone on increasing, and
a meat famine seemed imminent until Parliament
met the other day and hurriedly resolved by 28
to 7 that the tax should be repealed. The
graziers voted with the ayes ; they now want to
import store stock.
A cry from Junee :
Dear Bulletin.— l am a commonplace person desirous
of voting the right way on Federal referendum day ; and
as lam a bit hazy on one point I appeal to you to cast
a ray of light there. The financial clauses of the Bill are
easily understandable, Daily Telegraph correspondents
having clearly pointed out that 3s. 7d. is 225. 6d., and Dr
MacLaurin having sworn that the Federal tariff will be
15 per cent., while Lyne says it will be 34J4 per cent,
ana they both say that Coghlan says it will be 27 per
cent. The financial arrangement is good enough for me
and I shall vote “Yes” to that part of the Bill. But
here comes my difficulty : Senators shall be elected by
the whole province voting as one constituency. Well
analysis of the voting at the late S.A. and 5. elections
clearly show that, properly organised, the Labor-party will
have no difficulty in securing a majority in the Senate.
Now, ardently as I desire Federation, I cannot contem-
plate a Labor Senate without a shudder. Just imagine
Senator Holman bringing in a bill to nationalise all coal-
mines, and all the coaslal shipping* of Australasia ; or
Senator H. George proposing an alteration of the Con-
stitution providing for the abolition of the Lower House
the members of which, he says, are ancient fossils, hide-
bound Tories, rusty clogs on the wheels of progress, &c.
Kindly tell me if the Senate—which is almost certain to
be entirely composed of Labor rev olutionaries—can carry
into effect legislation of this diabolical character. My
reading of the Bill says they can.—Yours, &c., Salt Fish.
S.A. Parliamentary candidates.
ai;e compelled by law to . file a state-.,
ment of expenditure in connection,
with their candidature. Recent re-
turns tell an eloquent tale. S.A.
Labor party returned all its city
candidates at a total cost of .£125,
whereas Tory expenditure for the
same districts totalled over .£1,300.
In Torrens, Darling 1 , the Tory
nominee, spent ,£298 and only came
second on the poll, whereas Labor
man Conybeer, who headed the poll,
spent ,£ll. The heaviest Labor ex-
penditure in anry district was Price’s
£42 in Sturt, whilst Buce, the Tory,
spent £260 and was, “ left.”
Already the beneficent (M.L.)
Old-Age Pension idea shows signs of
expansion. Many foreign settlers
(principally Scandinavians) who have
been rooted in Maoriland for 25 to
30 years, are disqualified because they
failed to take out letters of naturali-
sation in their younger days. Pre-
mier Seddon now proposes to wipe
out the proviso re naturalisation,
holding, very sensibly, that the man
who has put in 25 or 30 or 40 years’
steady residence and is otherwise
qualified is a good enough citizen
to pass muster.
Ex-Q. Premier Nelson has established a
record for impudence. He had the mountainous
effrontery to rise from his presidential chair in Q.
Council and object to the Commonwealth Bill,
‘ because Queensland had no hand in the framing
of the measure ! ” And, as all Australia knows,
Nelson was the man who prevented his province
sending representatives to the Federal Con-
vention ! Q. Federation League should prepare
big posters for referendum day, emphasising the
fact that the cause of unity is opposed by Nelson,
Barlow and Unmaek. Those three names should
work like magic among Democratic electors.
A recent scare heading in Sydney Tele-
graph reads—“ What the Conference Bill means
(with its Braddon Blot).” And then follows this,
among the rest: —
Out of every £lOO to be raised by uniform taxation,
N.S.W. will pay £37 10s. ; other provinces, £62 10s.
And when you figure this out according to the
latest population estimates it just amounts to the
awful fact that N.S.W. will pay as much per head
as its neighbours !! The Secret Conference paper
is just putting its great flat foot down on its own
assertion that N.S.W. is to pay more than its
share of taxation. The King-street paper should
swear off telling the truth ; almost every time it
does the results are disastrous.
THE TROUBLES OF VICE-ROYALTY .
From a publicly-exhibited Sidney phrenological
chart of Earl Beauchamps “His Excellency it
finely organized. The fulness at back head indi-
cates love of children and animals; it also influences
him to take an interest in philanthropic movements,
particularly orphanages.”
Apropos of the Disunion party’s spectre in
general, and Dr. MacLaurin’s spectre in particular,
of the alleged heavy tariff which must be imposed
under the Braddon Blot, this is worth quoting.
It is a clause from page 4 of the report of that
famous “Committee on Federal Finance,” of
which MacLaurin, French, and Bruce Smith were
the three members :
As regards the raising of revenue, there is NOTHING
laid down in the Bill prescribing the mode' by which the
Federal Parliament shall do.so. After the establishment
of uniform tariff the Parliament is free to impose direct
taxation and relieve customs, or to rely wholly on the
latter.
Whereby Dr. MacLaurin knocks out his own
apparition in one round.
FOR UNION.
The Anti fears them near and far,
The sister States, poor dull-eyed gaby !
The wise man trusts them as they are,
But dreads the enemies they may be !
E.D.
TO THE MEN OF N.S.W.
In other States your foemen lie—
See Anti-Bill’s asseveration—
Convert them then forever by
The process of assimilation.
E.D.
An Ardent Appeal
Is often made to the public by the clergy for
assistance in worthy cases of affliction, but in the
following, the well-known reverend merely makes
a statement in the hope that it will be read, and
benefit those who may be suffering from liver
disease. He writes : “ I have pleasure in saying
that I have derived much benefit from the use of
Warner’s Safe Cure.”

Pretty well any sort of weakness or in-
capacitation is a crime in Victoria. Recently,
a young man, suffering from brain-tuberculosis,
was arrested for alleged insulting behaviour, and
given a month’s gaol, at the end of which he was
removed insensible to the hospital, where he
promptly died.
The Turner Government's programme for
the coming Vic. session includes a re-enactment
on a larger scale of the expiring Factories Act
with its minimum-wage proviso, a Referendum
Rill, an Old Age Pensions Bill, that oft-defeated
measure for the abolition of the plural property
vote, and a Usury Suppression Bill. But unless
the placid, comfortable Victorian people get
up with a ‘gibber” in each hand and inform
their House of 48 Rich Landlords that these
measures must pass, the chances are that the
Counci l wdl throw out four of them, and amend
to rea( J that interest mustn’t exceed

Melbourne, you will find them matchless for suits

Mr. Buekland resigned from Dubbo Trotting Club on

trouble was in allowing Alice H. to trot in saddle when
the conditions stipulated harness, and it was on that
grievance that Mr. Buekland resigned. With regard to
placing Alice H. on scratch, she" was an unperfonued
maiden and was put on scratch with the other maidens

competes in Sydney against the imported

is a two-column article on the decadence of the
trade of Freetrade Britain through the goods
of Protected America and Germany undersell-
ing her in her markets. Some extracts :
The Americans are underselling our manufactures of
steel and iron in the markets of the world, and actually
exporting thousands of pounds’ worth of machinery to
England, where, a short time ago, American locomotives
were absolutely unknown.
The Atbara bridge, ordered about February 1, was de-
livered aboard ship complete on March 7. The Americans
are making thirty locomotives for the Midland Railway,
and twenty locomotives for the Great Northern Railway,
and the first of these, ordered early in the year, will be
running in England before the spring is over.
Seven years ago, when Germany wanted a good ship,
she was obliged to come to England for it, and now she is
building bigger and faster steamers than those laid down
in British yards.
If Protection makes things so dear and so ruin-
ous, how are these things thus ?

There’s some rather unseemly squabbling
over the disposal of the money subscribed for a
memorial to the late old Jack Robertson, i hose
who favor the establishment of a memorial bursary
at Sydney University don’t think that any part
of the coin should be spent on a monument.
Scientific agriculture is the subject favored tor
the bursary.
The Sydney anti-Federal party proposes
to import Higgins, the Vic. lawyer, a second time,
to deliver anti-Federal speeches, and its organ,
the Telegraph, has obtained the services of •
Lormer, the well-known dreary Melbourne J.Jr.,
to write against Federalism in its columns—wit-
ness his tremendous diatribe in last Tuesdays
issue. Also, the Disunion party tried to get the
aid of John Downer, of S.A. And yet bow
furiously the Telegraph and the anti-Federal
party used to curse about the purely-imaginary
assistance which they said the Federal party was
obtaining from the other provinces—principally
Victoria, By the way, Higgins has done one
good service : he has made G. Dibbs a courteous
gentleman —occasionally. At the ordinary anti-
Bill meeting Dibbs used to go on something awful
about the general blastedness and bankruptcy
and want of principle of the people across the
border. But a mild, scared, polite, apologetic ;
Dibbs took the chair at Higgins’s meeting and j
tried to look as if he regarded the Victorian as a .
man and a brother. Apparently Dibbs only
speaks evil of his neighbors behind their backs.
The soporific Wilks, M.L.A., is of
opinion that if Federation means closing
the port of Sydney, “ which is fast becoming
the emporium of Australasia,” it is too much
to pay for union. The Wilks person, like a very
large section of the Sydney people, doesn’t wait
to hunt up facts and find out whether Sydney
(which no one proposes to close up) is “ becoming
the emporium ”or not. As N.S.W. is obviously
the greatest and richest place on earth, and it is a
self-evident fact that it must be ahead of every
other place in everything, Wilks just takes things
for granted. In 1891, when N.S.W. was at the
top of its glory, it had per cent, of the total
trade of Australia, while at the end of 1898 it had
less than 33J per cent. This is a very large slice
of the trade, but, all the same, Sydney isn’t “ fast
becoming the emporium ; ” in fact, it is rather less
of an emporium than it was seven years ago.
The crafty, but benighted Anti-Feds, are
working all the ropes of prejudice, sectarianism
and misrepresentation to beat the Constitution
Bill at the Referendum. They tell the democrats
that Federation means perpetuation of black
labor, and they warn the sugar planter that the
Federal Parliament will ruin his industry by
depriving him of the “cheap and reliable they
tell the people of C.Q. that separation will be iin-
gossible under Federation, and they caution the
outh that unity spells disintegration ; they rouse
the Yellow Pup by whispering that the Chief-
Justice will be a R.C., and stir up the R.C.’s to
demand some form of State recognition; the
farmer is to lose his farm, the merchant his ware-
house, the manufacturer his factory, the worker his
billet, the squatter his station, the swagman his
swag—the devil his due. The only things that
will remain are desolation, famishing families,
mortgages, ticks, bloated politicians and ab-
originals. '
A few words from Hansart/ by Pilcher,
M.L.C. (N.S.W.), now engaged in defending the
alleged last ditch of democracy in company with
Secret Caucus members McGowan, Holman and
Hughes. On the Bill for mining on private lands,
this great Democrat said (Hansard, vol. LXIX.
pp. 684-5): —
We all know how the Bill came into existence, who
clamors for it, and how it is to be used (Hon. G. H. Cox :
“It is one of the planks of the Labor platform.”) Of
course, we know that. ... If we did not know the
history of the Bill we might suppose from what the hon.
gentleman in charge of the Bill says that the measure
was introduced for the benefit of all classes. Of course it
was not. It is no good trying to humbug hon. members.
... I admit that if Capital wanted the Bill, we ought to
pass it, but Capital does not want, and has never asked/or
U. . . . We are simply offering a sop to Cerberus.
Yet now Pilcher is capering round N.S.W. in
company with the aforesaid Cerberus in the
alleged interests of Democracy ! ! !
The Sydney anti - Federalists have a
strangely one-eyed way of looking at things. One
far-seeing proviso in the Federation Bill is that,
for 10 years, till the new order of things has got
into working-order, the Federal Govt, may lend
money (at interest) to any State which finds itself
in temporary embarrassment. This will enable
the central Government to lend Tasmania or Vic-
toria’s surplus to N.S.W., if N.S.W. happens to
need it; it is an all-round proviso, by which any
State may benefit. Considering that N.S.W.
has been for many years the biggest borrower
among the States, it is quite likely it will be the
chief borrower under this proviso. But the
-Sydney anti-Federalists invariably talk of this as
a clause under which N.S.W. (which has the
biggest deficit in Australasia) is to lend its sur-
plus ” to its neighbors. The wild, weird cry of
the State with the biggest deficit about how its
surplus is going to be annexed is a remarkable
hunk of Chinese vanity.
Concerning an interesting Westralian rail-
way matter: —
Wilkie Bros, paralysed a crowd of contractors by ten-
dering for the Coolgardie railway miles below depart-
mental estimates. They got it, and made a big pile—
anything under just £300,000 would be near it. When
the Mullewa-Cue line—about 190 miles— was secured by
Baxter and Prince for a little over £4OO per mile—nearly
a fourth less than Govt, estimate —it was at once seen that
the luckless public using the railway would be called on
to make up the difference. It was not long ere the first
section was opened and then the contractors showed their
hand The teamsters loading for the Murchison found
thev could do better by taking delivery of goods at Mul-
lewa—bead of the Govt, line—and went on strike. Baxter
and Prince then started their own horse-teams from
the end of their first section and were masters of
the situation —for a time, at least. They started a carry-
ing firm under the name of Prince, Baxter and Go., and
had a virtual monopoly until the teamsters knuckled
under The carrying trade was, however, killed and in
due course the rails were laid right into One, nearly a
year before contract time. Of course both passenger
and goods-traffic rates were enormously higher than those
on Govt, lines, but it was clearly a case of the public
grinning and bearing it, while John Forrest pointed to a
wondering world the spectacle of the cheapest railway
Tver constructed in Australia. Now for the sequel.
Baxter and Prince are claiming over £lOO,OOO for extras
and loss occasioned by faulty plans and the usual sbort-
s"ghtedness of "he engineering branch but over and
above all, they claim to have sustained loss through
the wholesale exemptions granted by Govt, while
their contract was in progress ! This is about the
most novel claim that the Forrest Govt, has yet had to
consider and it brings them face to face with a phase of
the Question they have always shirked—whether granting
exemption to English co.’s is more advantageous than
compelling them to observe the labor conditions, and so
nnkno , wn o men^wltile a^tlie’’la i’^ U ol'llroten jllll
case J Vtough state of affairs-for the arbitrator, at any
rate.
Tas Parliament, which met on May 30, rushed
the Great Western Railway Rights Restitution
Bill through in double-quick time; then the
weary Braddon was suddenly made to sit up
bv a want-of-confidence blow aimed by Opposi-
tion leader Stafford Bird. The ostensible
reason for the onslaught was the unprepared-
ness of the Govt, in the matter of public busi-
ness. Braddon expected the debate on the
Address-in-Reply and on the Great Western
Syndicate’s Bill to last at least a week, whereas
it lasted two days, and the voice of the unem-
ployed legislator was loud in the land. But
the real trouble was the appointment of Miles
to the Lands and Mines portfolio. Miles was
always considered a strenuous Oppositionist,
and has long been a thorn in Braddon s
weariness. The appointment is held to be
unconstitutional, unprecedented, and altogether
disgraceful; but, windy absurdities aside,
the Premier, by the appointment, placed a
weapon in the hands of his enemies which a
less-tired autocrat would have never dreamed
of doing. Braddon’s Ministry was returned hve
years ago to square the finances and to promote
the principle of land-value taxation. Ihe
finances have certainly been squared, but in-
stead of any extra taxation of the AB,OOU,UUU
worth of land-values, lands and incomes
have been relieved to some extent. For
the past year or two Braddon has
been understood to promise to alter all this,
but he seems to have met Parliament with no
financial proposals whatever, and, so far from
redeeming his ancient promise to make a Trea-
surer’s grab for a larger slice of the Tas. land-
lords’ unearned land values, he has taken into
his Ministry the man of all others in the
Assembly who is most bitterly antagonistic to
any such proposal. Miles’s one good point is
that he is an advocate of a “ wealth-tax, but
even this little semblance of democratic prin-
ciple is too hazy in Miles’s case to be worth
much. Opposition - leader Bird objects a
little to Miles’s principles, and much more
to being himself passed over by Braddon
when there was a portfolio going. The
rank-and-file of the Opposition, including
the dreadful Dobson clan, require no spurring
to make them charge full tilt any day at Brad-
don and all his works—the Dobsons regard
Braddon as a dangerous red revolutionist. It
was really thought that the division on the no-
confidence motion would be close, and that a
Dreadful Dobson Ministry was in sight. But
the Opposition underestimated Braddon. The
weary autocrat beat them by 25 votes to 10.
And as Braddon, Tory as he is, is vastly better
than the Dobson push, the result is just as well
for Tasmania.

From recent S.M. Herald leader on things in
Sydney 6
It is distressing to read in this report some of the in-
stances given of the consequences proceeding from this
state of things. The lady-inspector gives examples of
women who are unable to spend more than three shillings
a week on food, while the average rate seems to be some-
thing like a shilling per day. In the past four years the
J'' er J? e weekly wage of these women has decreased from
25s. 8d. to 15s. '2|d. Makers of Oxford shirts, selling at
Is. lid. upwards, are paid from 2s. 6d. to 4s. per dozen.
An , instance is mentioned of a woman who made
moieskin trousers at 6d. per pair, but since Christmas
there had been a fall of £d. This woman was asked
what she lived upon. “ Bread and black tea," was the
answer; “I have bought sixpenny-worth of damaged
potatoes since Christmas, half a pound of butter in four
or five weeks, and when I feel very w’eak I get two or
three penny-worth of the cheapest meat.” We have no
desire to enlarge on these painful revelations, which
speak for themselves while reminding us once more of the
silent misery that goes on unceasingly ' in various forms
and shapes wherever men and women'struggle fora liveli-
hood together.
Is this the glorious result of the Freetrade the
Sydney dailies have continuously preached ?
Five years ago the “same old George” in-
augurated his “ jolly and fat ” policy, and the
rate of pay of an already underpaid class of
female slaves has shrunk from 25s. 8d. to
15s. 2£d. per week in that time. And the
Foreign-trade organ has “no desire to enlarge
on these painful revelations.”
“ M.B.” on the lodge-doctor question :—
“ C.C.” (29/4/’99) howls with lodge-secretary fervor in
favor of the club-system, but his arguments are quite un-
sound when generally applied. In his case the bargain
seems fair enough—he being apparently unmarried—but
the lodge patient to whom a medico naturally objects is
the well-to-do person possessing a sickly wife and a
string of weedy children, with power to add to the
number. “C.C.” accentuates the fact that the doctor
examines the applicant before admission and can
thereby protect, himself against chronic invalids. This
sounds very nice, but he does not mention that in the
great majority of lodges the candidate’s wife is not put to
the test. The family is never examined. Also, in a
powerful lodge, things are so managed that the doctor
who refuses many applicants is soon boycotted, and sees
his list dwindling rapidly in favor of his less-scrupulous
colleagues. In addition to the members’ family, the
lodges are taking in his dependent relations, so that ere
long we may expect a single fee to include attendance
on the next - door neighbors and the housedog.
There is a gambling element in it, but the odds
are heavily in favor of the lodge. Ikjsy Mo lays the
odds as “C.C.” suggests, but the gentle son of Israel
will not lay them for a single stake against the separate
fancies of the bettor, his wife, family and dependent
relatives. Which is exactly what the lodges wish from
their sweated surgeons. A premium of even 14s. a year
for a healthy single man would not be objected to by the
majority of club-doctors, but it is absurd to expect that
without sweating it can be made to include perhaps 20
persons of all ages. Which is the point so conveniently
missed by the club advocates.
A giddy young woman of “ Sowth ” Melb.
was found drunk on Queen’s birthday in an
empty house in that suburb in company with a
couple of beery sailors. On being find 5s. next
morning the lady asked for time to hunt up her
husband who, she was sure, would pay ! The
police assured the bench that the charming damsel
was a bride of less than a month, which so melted
the susceptible J.P. that she was allowed to depart
in peace. The happy bridegroom has not yet
been heard from.

To Herr Rassmussen.
Dear Sir.—l feel it my duty to write and tell you how
your remedies have cured me. '
I suffered great agony with WEAK NERVES and
RHEUMATICS, and I sent for some of your ALFALINE
REMEDIES, which completely cured me, and I have felt
as well as I could wish, although it is two years ago.
I also tried your ALFALINE UNIVERSAL PILLS,
which completely cleared my skin and purified my blood,
and I am now using your ALFALINE HAIR RESTORER,
which has thoroughly cleaned the scalp and made the
hair grow again, and it has gradually turned the hair
from being grey to that of its original color. I ha,ve also
recommended your Remedies for a number of different
complaints and I have never known them to fail, but to
do all that was claimed for them. I have great pleasure
to recommend these remedies to all sufferers, as I know'
they can be depended on. - - ; ■,

Dear Sir,— Having suffered for some time from a com-

pick up one of your books in the bush. I was thus in-

magical. I have often since recommended them to my
neighbors, all of whom have felt the benefit as well as
myself. I cannot express how glad lamat my recovery,

testify.—Yours truly, ~ (Signed) Mrs. H. SMITH.

VITADATIO IS
Undoubtedly
GREAT MEDICINE.
WHAT THINK YE OF THE TESTIMONIES ?
M R
10 Princes Street,
t. S. A. PALMER, Kew, 15th May, 1899.
Agent-General for “ VITADATIO.”
Dear Sir,—
In sending you this testimonial, I feel it will no more
IfP re * en v s m y ca ® e than a st - Bernard pup represents the
size of his great parents, still, small as it is, it is the
truth, and that s the main thing.
You know I have been twice to England to try and get
ease from my sufferings, and was there treated' bv some
of the best medical skill in the world, but all'to no
purpose. They told me at last that nothing could be
fS , even t 0 ease my pain (except to inject morphia), so
L had to g° on suffering, with no hope of ever getting
better. No one but a man like yourself can realise the
gloom and misery, yea, agony of such a state, but you
m bee i‘ "j 1 ®|milar plight, know how one in such a
case longs for death, and often feels inclined to do some
desperate act to be rid of such an existence.
I have tried all different treatments, Allopathic,
Homoeopathic, Hydropathic and Electropathic, I also
have tried Russian, Electric and Turkish Baths, and
others too numerous to menrion. One gentleman in
Sydney had me under the Crisis Treatment for six
months and when I would not let him torture me any
longer, he declared that if I allowed my sore, raw bodv
to dry, I should soon be a dead man. I told him that
death would rescue me from suffering, so I would face it.
I parted, telling him that if Satan was hard driven to find
some special torture to punish his most hated victims, I
thought that he was the man that could teach him
(Satan) some wrinkles.
When returning from England three years ago, God
knows that I never expected to land in Australia, I had
then given up all doctors, and just meant to let myself
die , I thought, surely I have tried enough and spent
enough, so will try no more. Thus I was just suffering
on till death should release me. Everything I did
whether eat, walk, talk, or sleep, was a burden to me. ’
Many who read this will remember how I then some-
tinies screamed with agony night and day. I went over
to Tasmania; here I first heard of “Vitadatio,” and I
may tell you that (if it had not been for reading the
declaration made by four gentlemen, who signed their
names, referring to the genuineness of your cure of Hy-
datids, in Invercargill, New Zealand), all the people in
this world would not have induced me to again start
taking physic, as I had been taking medicines for 13
years, and was getting worse.
I could not get “ Vitadatio ” in Burnie (Tasmania), so
had to wait till I came back to Melbourne. I procured
my first bottle at the Mutual Store, Flinders-street, Mel-
bourne.. I took five large bottles. It certainly strength-
ened me, but it did not take away my severe pain, so,
like many, I gave it up.
i A i )ol r , n foUr . months afterwards, Mr. Button, of Oat-
Jands, lasmania, introduced me to you (Mr. Palmer) and
your remarkable case, being so much like my own, led
me to go in for “Vitadatio," if it, should take my last
penny. I drank, as you know, 2 bottles weekly, yea, one
day I drank a large size bottle. I found it was food and
everything to me.
A well-known doctor with whom I was friendly con-
gratulated me on my improved looks each time he saw
me, so I kept on taking “ Vitadatio,” and, as you remem-
ber, I came every other day to your Head Office ; and so,
by seeing you, got your encouragement, which kept me
taking the medicine. I endured the pain and drank the
remedy, until the disease began to come away. Soon it
came away so fast that jl have got bottles full of the
disease three or four times a week, which I brought to
This, that had puzzled the doctors, when inside me
now puzzled them as they saw it in the bottles ; one even
said that it was the “lining of my bowels” coming awav.
in fact, I understand one of the doctors sent a letter to a
leading morning paper to that effect. I should think he
would now withdraw it. I said, “I hope I shall soon be
free from all such ‘lining’ as it is taking awav the
pain, and since the time I lost the “lining 6t my
bowels ” (as the doctors called it), I have put on a stone
weight of flesh, ano “ Hallelujah,” I can now sleep, eat
walk, talk and run, and that with pleasure (should the
same doctor see me now, instead of wanting ine to make
my will, as he did then, I think he would pass me for anv
Life Insurance Office). y
I have been cured of the following :
1. Running sores in the legs, of over 40years’standing.
To show the thoroughness of the cure, a small dog bit me
on the very place five u'eeks ago, which caused me some
sound and tW ° dayS ° f Pa ' n ’ but is now thoroughly
2. p iles, that for years were a trouble to me, are now
a thing of the past—from them I am perfectly free
3. Singing in my head, which was a constant nuisance
to me for seven (7) years, has completely left me.
4. Some small growths on the skin, which often troubled
me, have withered away, leaving only a stain on the skin.
th’J « v-7i e !P e ?, k i 8 as 80Und a 8 can be - I did not
take the Vitadatio for any of these complaints but
only for the dreadful agony which I suffered, on account
of the growth in the pit of the stomach, and which you
now have in so many bottles, but I am glad to say that I
can bring you no more, as it is all gone, “yes, all gone ”

Dear Sir,—
I wish to make known to you and those who nm he
suffering that VITADATIO has cured my wife of a most
serious trouble, viz., “severe pains in stomach and
spasms over the heart s region.”
wP® eSt <!o ct°rsAvere consulted, and stated the trouble
was Cancer,! Gallstones and Jaundice ” and that
nothing could be done save “an operation’” which in
her emaciated condition, we declined. ”
The doctor could only assist her in her great agony by
administering morphia and chloroform, which only gave
temporary relief. y g e
I decided to try VITADATIO for her.
She took 13 bottles.

The Stick and the Crust.
A stick and a crust of bread. Like the hands of
a clock these two articles told the time o’ day for
nearly a year in a certain man’s life. Yet, unlike
the hands oi a clock, they were not visible at once.
When he needed the stick he had no use for the
crust ; and when the crust was welcome he had no
further occasion for the stick.
Albeit he was a young fellow of twenty-six, you
would be wrong in supposing this stick to have
b en in the nature of a weapon for attack or de-
fence. In that case the crust and the stick would
have harmonised. As it was, they did not. For
the stick was a support, not a cluh.
Now, when a man feels the pressure of eighty or
ninety years, he is apt to want a travelling com-
panion of that sort ; but one in the very heyday of
youth, not suffering from any injury and not con-
stitutionally feeble, or malformed, should com-
monly be able to walk without a stick. And so
this young man had always done up to the time
when he fell out with the crust and with all that
the crust stood for or represented.
His own account of the circumstances runs
thus:—“Up to October, 1893, I bad been a
strong, healthy, and active man. Then I com-
menced to feel weak and out of sorts. I was
heavy, tired, and had no ambition or energy.
What had come over me I could not imagine. I
had a foul, nasty taste in the mouth, and was
constantly spitting up a thick, dirty phlegm. My
appetite, left me, and what little I ate lay on my
stomach like lead, causing me great pain about
the chest. A short, distressing cough settled
upon me and troubled me day and night.
“ At night my sleep was disturbed and broken
with night sweats and frightful dreams. I had
great pain at the left side around the heart, and
my breathing was hurried and short. Next I
began to spit blood, and was greatly alarmed at
it. I wasted away rapidly, losing over a stone
weight in a month, and became so weak that I
was unable to rise on my feet without assistance.
“Although only a young man of twenty-six, I
was obliged to hobble about with a stick , and could
walk hut a short distance even at that. Worried
and anxious, I attended the Yoik County Hospital,
where the doctors sounded me, and said I was in
a consumption.”
Here we have another of the serious and often
fatal mistakes Uat are made in cases like this.
Misled by symptoms which in some respects re-
semble those of consumption, medical men hastily
decide that the lungs are affected, treat the patient
perfunctorily for the hopeless disease he is not
afflicted with, and leave the result to chance.
Hence he often dies of dyspepsia and its complica-
tions - his true disease—which, unlike consump-
tion, is easily curable by the remedy our friend
finally employed.
u They gave me cod-liver oil,” he continued,
“and medicines, but I got no better. Indeed, I
was so low-spirited and miserable I didn’t care
what became* of me. As time passed, I grew
weaker and weaker.
“ After I had endured ten months of this, Mr.
R. W. Dickinson, the chemist in Walmgate, ad-
vised me to try Mother Seigel’s Syrup. After
taking it a few days I felt muoh better, my appe-
tite reviving and my food giving me no pain. I
continued to take this medicine only, and soon
the cough and breathing trouble left me and I
began to gain strength and flesh. When I had
taken three bottles I was as strong as ever, and
could eat and enjoy even a drif crust. I have
since had good health. You are liberty to publish
this letter and refer all inquirers to me. (Signed)
Isaiah Lewis, 124 Walmgate, York, April Bth,
1894.”
If the reader wonders how a man could suffer
so much, become so emaciated and weak, and be
pushed so near the grave’s edge through what is
sometimes flippantly called “mere indigestion,”
he has yet to learn that the digestion is the arbiter
of life and death. The “crust” (food), enjoyed
and digested, means life and strength. Rejected
it means the “stick,” to supplement swift-coming
weakness ; and then the prone position, when help
is vain. Mother Seigel’s Syrup enabled Mr. Lewis
to substitute the. crust for the stick. It cured his
dyspepsia.*

EIGHT YEARS’ SUFFERING.
AT TIMES
A PERFECT CRIPPLE.
Teralba to the fore with a Wonderful
Cure.
The Case of
Mrs. W. FULTON.
(For the “ Newcastle Hemhl”)
News of the wonderful recovery of Mrs.
W. Fulton, of Teralba, havin' readied
Newcastle, a reporter was despatched to
investigate the case, with instructions to
get the plain truth. His enquiries in the
township before seeing Mrs. Fulton went to
prove that, in this case, Clements Tonic
had performed a really wonderful cure, and
this will be conclusively proved by the facts
related by the lady herself in the presence
of one of her sons and a neighbour.
Mrs. Fulton, a widow now for 13 years,
is about the oldest resident in Teralba., and
is well known as a respectable, bard-
working woman and the mother of a large
family. When the reporter explained his
mission to Mrs. Fulton she extended her
hand and accorded him the warmest of
warm welcomes.
“ Yes, I am delighted you have called,’*
was her first remark when we had got
seated. “A gentleman,” she added,” called
the other day, and I told him that I knew
from practical experience more about the
virtues of the preparation than any other
living woman. I told him about the
benefits I had derived from Clements
Tonic. ”
“Might we again go into the details of
your illuess ?” suggested the reporter.
“With pleasure, sir,” replied Mrs. Fulton.
“I have often said to the neighbours here
that I ought to write into the paper about
my wonderful cure. Now'that you are here
I shall tell you everything, and I should
feel graceful to you if you publish my
account ”
“I can tell you,” said Mrs. Fulton,
commencing her narrative, “ that I had
been bad for eight years off and on. I was
at timesa perfect cripple, suffering, I believe,
from sciatica; the pains used to attack me
in the chest, the small of the back and the
hip, the knee joints, and in the left ankle.
For months I could not walk, I must have
been six months laid up in bed, fairly
screaming with the pain. Many a time I
prayed for death. I took more medicines
than would scald a pig, and I spent pounds
upon pounds of money that was badly
needed for the household upon so-called
remedies and doctors’ fees. I could neither
eat nor sleep owing to the severity of the
pains. I wasted away to a mere shadow,
witli cold sweats still running off my
forehead under the strain of acute pain.
I was a martyr to indigestion for some
thirty years. This boy (pointing to bsr
son) and his married sister can tell you that
they have, at my request, laid on me to
kill the pain in my chest from indigestion.
There is no fiction in this story. All the
people in Teralba know bow I have suffered.
They all know, too, that ihe doctors gave me
up and told my sons that I could not
possibly get over it.”
“ I'es.” interjected the lady from next
door, who had been listening to all Mrs.
Fulton bad said, “ I know it for a fact that
Mrs. Fulton was given up by the doctors.”
“I was nothing but bone and skin,”
continued Mrs. Fulton, “when I was
re ommended to try Clements Tonic some
six or eight months ago. My son, Andrew,
an engine driver, wrote from Murrurundi,
where lie was then located, and told me to
try Clements Tonic. He said that one of
the engine drivers up there h-d suffered
much in the fame way as I was suffering,
and that Clements Tonic had cured him.
I must say I did not relish the idea of more
expense in patent medicines, but soma
friends peisuaded me to get a bottle, and I
thank heaven that I did so. I have since
had eight lar. e bottles and a few small
ones, ami I will never be without a bottle
as long as I have the means to buy one.”
“ Id ow soon did you experience relief?”
“The first bottle practically cured me,”
said Mrs. Fulton, in a voice that was deep
with emotional gratitude. “I shall never
forget the change that came over me, for I
believe I have suffered more than any other
woman of my age (57) who lia still to work
for a living.”
“Which left first—the indigestion or tin.
sciatica pains ? ”
“ Well I believe the relief first came in
the chest, because after a few doses I
became able to eat a little, and I remember
saying to my married daughter that I felt
able to digest my food. 1 notice this about
Clements Tonic that the more one takes of
it the bttter in health one becomes. Take
my case as an example. I have been
getting better and better with each bottle
until I am as you see me now—fat and
well.”
The reporter had to confess that it was
hard to believe that a wasted woman who
was looked upon as a chronic cripple could
possibly be the same plump and hearty
figure that he had just noticed coming dowr
the bill.
“It is the absolute gospel truth,” inter
jeettd the neighbour, “that a few months
back Mrs. Fulton was looked upon as an
incurable cripple, seeing that she had been
laid up for six months.”
“ Yes, indeed ! I never thought,” added
Mrs. Fulton, “ that I would ever he able
again to leave my bed, much less be able to
walk straight.”
“The troubles have now all disappeared,
I suppose ?”
“Yes, my general state of health i
better now than it has been for twentj
years past. I can eat well and relish mj
food. I can do hard work with any other
woman of my age, and I can enjoy the
benefits of a good night’s sleep—a thing that
has been unknown to me. I attribute it all
to the use of Clements Tonic, and I take it
that it will be just as effectual to the poor
sufferer. If you publish the facts as I have
given them to you I am sure the report will
he read with interest by all the people of
Teralba, because, as I said before, they all
know how bad I was. It was a great
triumph for Clements To ne, and Mr.
Clements can publish it how he likes.”

COUNTRY TRIAL ORPCR RESPCCTFULLY SOLICITED
The Circling Hearth-Fires.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My Countrymen, though we are young as yet
With little history, nought to show
Of lives enleagued against a foreign foe—
Torn flags and triumph, glory or regret ;
Still some things make our kinship sweet,
Some deeds inglorious but of royal worth,
As when with tireless arms and toiling feet
We felled the tree and tilled the earth.
’Tis no great way that we have travelled since
Our feet first shook the storied dust
Of England from them, when with love and trust
In one another, and large confidence
In God above, our ways were ta’en
’Neath alien skies—each keeping step in mind
And soul and purpose to one trumpet strain,
One urging music on the wind :
Yet tears of ours have wet the dust, have wooed
Some subtle green things from the ground—
Like violets—only violets never wound
Such tendrils round the heart; the solitude
Has seen young hearts with love entwine ;
And many gentle friends gone down to death
Have mingled with the dust, and made divine
The very soil we tread beneath.
Thus we have learned to love our country, learned
To treasure every inch from foam
To foam ; to title her with name of Home ;
To light in her regard a flame that burned
No land in vain, that calls the eyes
Of rnen to glory heights and old renown;
That wild winds cannot quench, nor thunder-skies
Make dim, nor many waters drown.
Six hearths are circled round our shores, and
round
The six hearths group a common race,
Though leagues divide; the one light on their face,
The same old songs and stories rise ; the sound
Of kindred voices and the dear
Old English tongue make music ; and men move
From hearth to hearth with little fear
Of aught, save open arms and love.
To keep these hearth-fires red, to keep the door
Of each house wide—that is our part!
Surely ’tis noble ! Surely, heart to heart,
God’s love upon us and one goal before
Is something worth ! Something to win
Our hearts to effort ! Something it were good
To garner soon ! And something ’twould be sin
To cast aside in wanton mood.
My Countrymen, hats off ! with heart and will
Thank God that you are free, and then
Arise, and don your Nationhood like men,
And, manlike, face the world for good or ill.
Peace be to you, and in the tide
Of years great plenty till Time’s course be run ;
Six Ploughmen in the same field side by side,
But, if need be, six Swords as one.
RODERIC QUINN.
The Revenge of the Mind.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It was at the rare times when his spiritual, in-
tellectual nature was momentarily triumphan
that he tried to grapple with the problem o ns
own character. It had early been instilled into
him that reason was superior to instinct, ye in
his own case he saw the refutation of this theory.
Here, invariably, in his early manhoo > tie
mind-man paid homage to the flesh-man. 1 e
former —artistic, aesthetic —abhorred eveiytiing
that savored of grossness or sensuality ; baske in
the glow of poetry and art ; sought its delights in
the stars and the music of the silence. The latter
—essentially gross —craved unceasingly foi t ie
earth and its vileness, and invariably, after a
bitter fight with its antagonist, it obtained its de-
sire.
And this was the problem he was slow to solve :
why did reason ever succumb to instinct ; and
which was the real man —the flesh or the mind ?
The first flush of youthful manhood had left
him, when the flesh-man, seeking ever new de-
lights, saw and loved the woman whom he made
his wife. She was of a distinctly lower type than
himself. She had all his sensuality and grossness,
without any of his redeeming intellectuality ; but,
nob yet awakened to this fact, in the early time of
his marriage he was very satisfied with the woman
he had wedded.
His love for her became almost madness. He
forgot in its warmth all other objects in life ; he
was content to spend every moment of his time in
her company, and his happiness seemed complete
on the birth of his infant daughter.
As the years went by this love for mother and
daughter—only the one child was born to him—
continued unabated ; and then, when he was only
at that period of life when most men are strong
and vigorous, he found himself changing. The
elasticity began to desert his limbs ; the bright-
ness to go from his eyes, and the zest for life to
wane. What formerly he had delighted in he
now viewed with indifference, even disgust. He
secluded himself more and more from all outside
companionship, and his temper, always uncertain,
became more fitful than ever. A moodiness
settled upon him, and he realised that at length
the rule of the flesh-man had ended, and that the
mind-man reigned—despotic, unpitying, demand-
ing of him stern accouut of the doings of its pre-
decessor. ~ .
His days were passed now in brooding, brood-
ing. And a thing which surprised those who
noticed it, his love for wife and child grew cold
and colder as the months went by and his illness
increased, till it seemed that their very presence
was hateful to him. .
His wife, in her dull, narrow way, noticed the
change, and wondered at it. At first, she thought
it merely a passing phase of his illness ; then, as
his dislike intensified instead of departing, she
grew angry and cold, and blamed him bitterly for
his altered deameanor. She never doubted that
it was merely that he had grown tired of her; her
reason was too limited ever to suspeot that perhaps
a deeper motive lay somewhere.
And his daughter—she had grown into radiant
maidenhood. Prom every movement of her lithe,
graceful limbs appealed the vigor of an ardent,
passionate blood. In the rounded contour of the
cheek ; in the challenge of the laughing eyes ; in
the smile of the red, ripe lips, one saw life—life,
flushed and triumphant. She marked the change
in her father, and, possessing some of his intellect,
wondered wherein lay the cause. She tried, as
her girlish tact directed her, to win back his love.
That which she knew had the strongest appeal to
him, that she laid at his feet, only to find that her
efforts, instead of pleasing, irritated him, and far
from calling back that former love, rather intensi-
fied his hate. .
And day by day, as his weakness increased, the
man sat by himself, brooding, brooding.
* * * »
All day the man had been irritable and moody,
and his wife heard him, hour after hour, in the
room overhead pacing up and down, with scarcely
a rest in the monotony. And when night came
he lit the lamp, and, unlocking a drawer in his
desk, emptied the contents upon the table, and
sat down.
The blackness of his face deepened, as one by
one he examined the objects before him, and laid
them in a pile in the centre of the table. A letter,
in its faded ink and with its gilt edges turning
green, he tore into fragments, with a sneering
curse. A bunch of withered flowers, with a dis-
colored ribbon twisted about them, he crunched
and rolled in the palms of his hands, and cast the
dust upon the remnants of the letter. A tiny
locket with an indistinct miniature portrait made
him smile, only it was a smile that had no mirth
in it. And then he found a photograph. A little
baby face smiled out at him, and a pair of tiny
hands stretched forth as to embrace him. At the
sight, his face grew livid with anger, and he
started from the face in the frame as if it were a
thing of evil. He lifted the photograph to cast it
into the fire
“Father, see what mother gave me. It is
my birthday.” His daughter was smiling at
him from the open door —a radiant figure of life
and youth. In her outstretched hand she held a
golden chain and a trinket from which the lamp-
rays sprayed indiscriminately in showers of
brilliant light-atoms.
For an instant the man cowered away from her,
and his hands sought his face as if the vision
blinded him. Then a sudden, mad passion moved
him to action : a snarling curse rang from his
livid lips and he leapt to her side. He dashed
the glittering trinkets to the floor and crushed
them beneath his heel. Then his hands' darted
viciously forward . . . His wife, dozing by the
fire downstairs, heard something which caused
her, in very excess of terror, to leap up the stair-
case.
* * • *
It was after the passing of the long illness
brought upon her by the tragedy of that night
that his wife went to see him. The asylum
attendant told her as he conducted her down a
long, lighted corridor: “He is very quiet, and
seldom speaks—except to himself. He is quite
harmless now. When the days are fine and warm
lie walks by himself for hours about the grounds,
his head bowed and his hands clasped behind him,
thinking; brooding. At times a queer mood
comes to him, and then by his actions you would
judge that he re-enacts some deed that impressed
him in the past. He is in here.”
The attendant softly opened a door at the end
of the corridor and peeped in. Then He stepped
back, and, motioning the wife to approach, he
whispered, “Look now.”
The man was sitting by a table, his face
glowing with smouldering anger, ana his eyes
shining steadily. His hand* moved, one over the
other, as if tearing something; they swept for-
ward across the table as if gathering something
into a heap. He crunched and rolled his palms
together, and again made that sweeping forward
movement.
Next, he seemed to be looking at something in
his outstrete ed hand, and the watchers at the
door saw him shrink from it, as if struck in the
face. Turning at that instant, he saw them, and
started to his feet. His face lighted as he recog-
nised his wife. “ You have come at last,’’ he said,
monotonously—as if he had said it all before. “ I
have wished for that. I wanted to tell you why I
did it—why I killed her. It was the revolt of the
mind against the tyranny of the flesh ; revenge for
past insult and neglect. She came to me dancing,
with her beautiful face aglow ; hurrying to show
me her pretty things because it was her birthday.
Her birthday ! Did she know—or did you—how
I have cursed the day which saw her birth? I
am old and weak and'so very weary—and why?
The fault was hers. She robbed me of my strength
—my life. She came to me so strong ; so young ;
so beautiful ; but did she owe it to herself? She
owed it to me. To me, I tell you, whose life-
blood she sucked from my veins. It was
my vitality that gave the challenge to her
eyes. My blood flushed in her cheeks, and
crimsoned her lips, and lent grace to her limbs.
Why should I be so weak, and she so strong? Am
I not greater than she? It has been growing a
long time, this passion which has ended thus. In
my youth I was strong ; in my early manhood not
even the Immortals excelled me ; and now what do
you see me ? A cinder, lightless and cold ; the
fire has gone out. Naught remains to me but my
brain, and that is a torment—it thinks, remem-
bers, reproaches. ‘ Day by day I saw her grow-
ing stronger and fairer, and felt myself weakening
—dying. I wondered why she should laugh and
be beautiful. And then I knew. She had assumed
the life that was going from me. I saw in her the
embodiment of all my wasted vitality ; all the
vigor of my body was gathered within her. I
knew it, and it made me mad. And she came
when the devil was strongest. It was the anni-
versary of her birth—and the desire for revenge
came to me. I fed it upon memories of what had
been. See yonder—the fragments of torn paper ”
with a gesture towards the table, as if what he.
spoke of lay there. “Your letter one of
many which you sent me years ago. That
crushed flower you pinned in my coat on our
wedding-day. Pleasant reminiscences, were they
not, when you think to what they led ? The
miniature portrait of yourself is there too ; do you
remember it ? I have often cursed the face it re-
presents —yours; and you brought her into the
world ; my lost vitality vivified. And then that
little photograph! she as a baby, clad in her
pretty laced frock which you made for her, and
diademed by the red roses which I placed in the
flaxen curly hair of which we were so proud.
Cannot you see it even there? My life moving
her baby hand and wreathing the prattling lips
into that baby smile. My soul looking out from
her baby eyes. And she came when I was mad ;
came to tell me it was her birthday. Why did ,
she come ? ”

The Blind Eye of the Law.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is generally considered an impossible thing to
marry another man’s wife. But this is a mistake.
It is possible in Maoriland ; More than that—it
has been done there.
* * in
Tukntuku s father had assimilated pakeha no-
tions regarding land, and, forsaking his Maori
counnun.stio ideas, had procured through the
.Native Land Court a bona fide, title to 10 000
acres - his share of the tribal territory. Those
10,000 acres became real estate, in which Tuku-
tuku had a distinct interest—she was the old
chief s only child -and when she reached a mar-
riageable age she had no lack of suitors. There
was Tile from Okiwi, and llone from Koroniti,
and limdti from Kaiteriteri, and Hamuera from
Onatea. But Tiki was a man of small conse-
quence; Hone, though a chief of some mana, was
hunchbacked; Tunoti was too fond of waipiro,
and under its influence had beaten bis late wife
till she d.ed ; Hamuera was such a li. tie man, and
iuku, who was a fine big girl, could not bring
herself to marry a pigmy.
Rulcu llveJ a hundred miles from Omokau,
Tuku s kuianja. He was a man of both mana and
lands ; a ran./atira like Tuku, and as handsome'as
she was pretty. Ruku felt he was the man to
win the belle of Omokau. So lie came along the
coast in style, in the biggest canoe of his tribe,
rowed by fifty men. The magnificence of bis
progress was heralded before him, and bis advent
at Omokau was celebrated with a powhiri and
feasting—such as are given only to the most wel-
come guests.
Ruku s visit was of a formal nature—fcbat was
quite und a-stood-but for all that his
began with little delay. When Tuku saw bim°
she asked her father, quite asm matter of course’,
if he wmnd accept Ruku as a son-in-law, supposing
their guest made love to her. And her father, a
really courteous old tattooed gentleman, said’he
would feel honored to do so. This, according to
Maori etiquette, gave Tuku carte blanche-, he
need stick at nothing. And she didn’t.
The first evening that the guests and their en-
tertainers were assembled in the whare-runan;a,
where tire festive gatherings took place, Tu\ u ’s
eyes often stole towards Ruku when she thought
lie; wasn’t looking, but she did not speak to him—
that would have been giving herself away too
early—and she noticed that their eyes'met con-
tinually. She didn’t know it, but Ruku was
hoping that she was the girl lie had come to court
—of course, lie was too well-bred to ask for Tuku-
tuku straight away. And Tuku tried to seem
quite unconcerned under his scrutiny, and talked
and laughed with the girls that sat round her.
On the second night she sat herself nearer the
young chief, atid remained in the house long after
all but a. few of the other women had retired to
away. h ' at, ‘ But at Usfc Bh ® weat reluctantly
,„i°| I1 ( - t^ e ,U,C ! nigllt she a;i t dose to Ruku and
whilst the laughter and talk were at their height
she.put her hand into his, in token of her affee

s the Jove of war. After a spell of domestic
bliss the war-fever took Ruku suddenly in its
clutches, and he went off to wage the pakeha's
battles in the Ureweracountry. And T.iku stayed
in the kaianja with her pieaninny Pebahsi—-the
keepsake of the departed Ruku. Tukutuku’s
father was now dead, and she was a wahine nui,
poses-ed of ten thousand acres of land.

i 'r aol ‘> -lukutuku, accompanied by a woman
attendant, often took a canoe and coasted along
the shore to a place where she could bathe in
shallow, warm water undisturbed, and afterwards
enjoy a sun-bath on the hot white sand. This
bathing-p.ace was a little indentation in the
shore-line, sheltered on either side by lofty sand-
dunes, upon which the sun beat hotly.' The
natives called it “ I'ukutuku's Bath.”
Cru.ttan.len began by gaining the confidence of
the pic ini uny. He. made him flax boats, baked
turn toffee out of Government butter'and sugar,
caught cicadas ( kihikihi) for him in the bush, till
the child loved the pqkchu better than he did
ns absent father. But, to his credit, Cruttenden
became as fond as he could be of the jolly, laugh-
ing, round bit of brown humanity. Women are
the same all the world over—Tukutuku felt drawn
towards the fine, upstanding white runjatira who
took such notice of her child.
* * * »
It was a clear, azure day. The sky was blue
the sea was b.ue, the “ bush” on the hills was
blue, and not a breath of the rarified winter air
•stirred .Everything was still. In the sun it was
genially warm ; in the shade it was all but freez-
mg. JNothing could be more delicious on such a
day than to bask in the sunshine, with an invioor-
atmg yet. tranquil atmosphere preventing that
lassitude which comes so n Aurally to the Maori
iukutuku was m her bath : she lay baskuW in
the still, sun-warmed, shallow water, with Tier
head just above the glistening wavelets, and the
mass of her black hair floating on the surface The
attendant and Pepeha had had their bath, and
were playing on the sand ; the Woman was pre-
ending to catch kati.po, to the.child’s utmost glee.
Rut his laughter was suddenly stopped by the re-
port of a gun, and a flock of gulls flew overhead.
As the birds swept past, a voice came over the
waters shooing ” the gulls in their flight.
that is the pakeha shooting karo.ro,”
said luku. ( And she had hardly spoken when
Orutteuden s canoe appeared, round the sandhills,
tie was alone, paddling-slowly along with the
muzzle of his gun sticking up above the side of

hgur ■« showed black against the white dunes. He
called out in Maori, and the pieanintry answered

lie did not see Tuku in the water till he was
close upon her, and she, far from being discon-
certed by his presence, began to talk to him as he
sat in his koki by h^r.
Suddenly I’uku broke off her conversation with
the white man, and said to Kura, “The picauinny
cannot walk back to the kaianna, and he is too
heavy for you to carry. Take the pakeha's canoe
—he will let you have it—and take the child back
to tlie village.
Cruttenden got out of the koki and romped
awhile with Pepeha on the sand, and when Kura
had taken her p ace in the little craft, he waded
out and placed the child safely by his nurse, and
the woman and Pepeha soon disappeared from
the scene, rukutuku and the white man were
alone upon the beach.

Ruku had had his fill of war. He had returned
to Quiokau a, battered wreck, with a limp in his
a,,d mum l f ™ fyo. All his handsomeness
vy.is gone-one bullet had struck him obliquely in
the cheek, and had played havoc with his face,
and--another had smashed his ankle-bone. So
much for Rukus passion for war.
His wife scorned him ; she would hardly look
at him Ins face certainly formed her sufficient

another bird will vvarm his nest for him.” Even
his child avoided him, and, frightened at his dis-
figured face, ran to the white man.
In the good old pr e-pakeha days, Ruku would
have quickly squared things with a tomahawk
with such a man as Cruttenden, but, now, the
Spleen s writ rail through Maorilaud from end to
end, and Ruku knew only too well what the law
he had helped to establish would do if he “ tuki-
tukied a white man. So for a while he did
nothing but brood over bis sullied honor and
vanished prestige.
But the half-blind cripple was still a true toa : it
was more than flesh and blood could stand to see
with las remaining eye—another man usurp his
conjugal rights. And—Law or no Law-one dark
night, murder was all Rut committed in Tulcu-
tuku s ivharc.
Cruttenden was well versed in legal matters per-
tarning to the Maori, and knew just, how the case
stood in the Eye of the Law. And, one day,
when a cutter appeared off Omokau, he put off to
it in_a canoe, and stayed a long while conferring
with the skipper. ”
Next morning, the cutter sailed away with
Oruttenden and Tukutuku on hoard.
. * * •
The District Court of Bether was sitting, and
District Judge Vanderdiek sat upon the bench
In the box’ stood Ruku, with a big, half-healed
wound down his. right cheek, and his face uglier
than ever—Cruttenden had evidently come off
best in the midnight broil.
Rnku addressed the Court through an inter-
preter. “ .before Te Kpoti 'haute liack' from the
Chathams I was married to my wife. I am a
good subject of Queen Wikitoria: in fighting for
her I became what I now am—a man only good
for digging kumura. My wife has gone off with
a pakeha , who was sent to my kaianpa while I was
at the war. I want the Government to give her
back to me. When I tell her to come, she says
she is married to the pakehct according to the
proper ri(cn;/a of the white mart. If Igo and kill
that pakeha and take her, the Law will kill me
quick—no good ! Now, I want you, the Judge
who sees to these, things, to get my wife Tukutuka
and bring her back to me. I who have fought for
your Queen say, ‘Let the strong hand of your
Law give me back my wife from the pakeha who
stole her.”’
District Judge Vanderdick looked at his notes ;
mumbled to the Clerk of the Court:; examined his
notes again, and then said, “ When did the Maori
marry this woman ? ” And the answer came back
through the interpreter, “ I married her six years
before Te Kouti massacred the people of Poverty
Bay. I fought with R ipata against Te Kooti.”
“ But ask him how he married her? ”
“How did I marry?” exclaimed Ruku. “1
married her all right, in the way my ancestors
married before me. I think that a” very good
way.”
Judge Vanderdick fumbled with his notes. He
had never had such a case before. u Er—ah, the
fact is, •’ he said, “that is to say, I’m shuah this
is—ah—very awkward, very awkward indeed, but
the Law does not seem to make provision for such
a case. Ihe Law does not seem to—ah—recognise
the Maori.form of marriage. In the eye of the
Law, this man’s wife was not legally married till
she married this—ah—white man, of the name of
—er— yes, of—or—the name of Cruttenden, accord-
ing to the prescribed legal method. This is a
most unusual case : the Law seems to have over-
looked the status of such men as this-er—Roko-
roko. Eh ? . Ruku ? Yes, to be sure, his name
is Ruku. Tell Ruku, then, that the Law is
powerless to interfere on his behalf—er—ves, on
his behalf—yes, entirely powerless to interfere,”
When Ruku had fully grasped what the learned
Judge meant, he delivered himself thus: “You
tell your Judge his Law is like me—blind in one
eye. With its other eye it looks at the white man
it never sees the Maori unless he has been
d ring something wrong. Some day—l’m not sure
when—but some day, we Maori inen will knock
out its other eye,.and then your law will be blind
in both eyes—like your Judge there.” But the
interpreter failed to translate—he was too taken
aback at this flagrant contempt of court—and
Ruku limped out of The Court-house like a lame
.pukeko hopping outof a swamp.
. Cruttend n was left in indisputable posses-
sion of Tuku, his lawful wedded Wife, and tier
ten thousand acres of land. -

“Given up for Dead.
Restored to Perfect Health”
Only three bottles cure severe lameness from
rheumatism, flesh is regained, eyesight improved,
and natural health returns.
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla

“I have been a great sufferer from rheumatism and liver complaint, and
was very lame.
“My brother, who was very ill, was given up for dead by the doctors. But
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla put new life in him, and he and my father, hearing I was so
ill, recommended this medicine to me. Before I had taken three bottles I felt
improved. My lameness began to leave me and I began to feel like a new
woman. I also regained much flesh which I had lost. Strange though it may
seem, my eyesight, which had become weak, gradually became stronger, until it
was perfectly natural.”
This testimony from Mrs. Mary Bright .(whose portrait is here given), of Cor-
nish Town, Cobar, New South Walds, must strongly impress all who read it.
It tells of the wonderful power of Ayer’s Sarsaparilla to drive disease out of
the system.
How could a testimonial tell more? How could a remedy do more? Put
your confidence in Ayer’s Sarsaparilla,
“The World’s Greatest Family Medicine.”
Because other medicines have failed should not discourage you. One great
medicine is left for you—Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. It acts directly on the blood,
takes out all impurities. ,
