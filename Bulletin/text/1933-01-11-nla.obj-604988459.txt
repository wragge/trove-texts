FACTS!
The only type of
circulation tHat
has real worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. Th&se
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought because people want them in their
homes.
Tine daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
economic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

NATIONAL SONG COMPETITION
PRIZE WINNERS AND JUDGES’ REPORTS
At a conference of Directors of Education
held in Sydney last year Mr. J. Mcßae,
of Victoria, introduced the subject of a
national song. The position, as revealed,
was that each State had one or two
“national songs” that were sung in the
schools, but no two States had the same
song, though the same song was sung in
some of the schools of several States;
thus a song produced and in general use in
S. Australia—“ There Is a Land”—had been
heard also in Westralia and Tasmania. It
was agreed that it was desirable that one
national song should be in use throughout
the Commonwealth. Further, it was sug-
gested that, as many things had happened
since the songs now in use were written—
Australia had become a Commonwealth, for
one thing—it might also be desirable to
ascertain if something better was not forth-
coming. The Bulletin offered to see what
could be done about it, and, the matter
being left in its hands, prizes of £25 and
£lO, and five prizes of £1 each, were offered.
After consultation with Mr. Mcßae, who
had introduced the subject, these three high
authorities were asked and presently con-
sented to act as judges: Mr. J. Le Gay
Brereton, Professor of English Literature,
Uni. of Sydney; Mr. G. Ross Thomas,
Director of Education, Sydney; and Dr.
Arundel Orchard, Director of the State
Conservatorium, Sydney. They have now
completed their long and arduous task (in
all 1147 entries were received) and each of
them has been good enough to furnish an
exhaustive report embodying his conclu-
sions.
THE JUDGES’ REPORTS.
Professor Brereton wrote: —
“Of the songs there arc two which seem
better than the rest. I select ‘Australia.’ by
White Heather (501). and ‘All for Thee,
Australia,’ by Acacia (S2B). In one respect,
at least, ‘All for Thee! has the advantage,
inasmuch as the author’s grip of technique
seems surer, and he has, moreover, a certain
savor of poetry, at least in one stanza. It
is not so well proportioned, however, as
‘Australia.’ A third of the piece is devoted
to our dead soldiers, and that ‘dates’ it too
strictly as coming from the present genera-
tion. I highly commend it, but give my vote
for ‘Australia’ on the following grounds:—
“(1) Simplicity of expression. Every part of it
would be easily understood by all who were likely
to sins it—even the small children.
“(2) An easy and telling metrical scheme. It is
musical, and the short stanzas, having only one rhyme
each, and no unrhymed lines except the refrain, are
easily retained in the memory. It is an advantage,
too, that those who taught the song in the schools
would have to insist upon the proper pronunciation
of ‘Australia,’ the word which recurs with emphasis
and sonority.
“(3) Comprehensiveness. A great deal is suggested
in little space. We appreciate and praise our land
for (stanza 1) its freedom secured by geographical
advantages, (st. 2) its natural charm and produc-
tivity, (st. 3) the courage, endurance and patriotism
of its heroes, and (st. 4) its position as a division
of the British Empire. All that packed, without
crowding, into a dozen lines.
“There is one word, however, in line 10,
which must be altered. ‘Star-crossed’ has
been fixed in the language with the meaning
‘thwarted by destiny’ (see ‘Romeo and
Juliet,’ prologue, line 6), and one cannot in
a national anthem apply the epithet to Aus-
tralia’s flag.”
Mr. Ross Thomas wrote:—
“The work of assessing was anything but
easy, seeing there was such an equality of
mediocrity, so to speak. There does not
seem to me to be one outstanding poem. I
would place 792 (Obadiah M.) first, using
‘worthy’ instead of ‘noble’ in the refrain;
but so many lines run on, and from the
point of view of musical setting this would
present very great difficulty. Then I place
501 (White Heather) and 150 (Seneschal)
equal, and after them as equal 492 (Devon)
and 326 (Dairyfarmer). No. 492 has dis-
tinct merit; but why 'the ‘shy’ south, and
wh’- ‘Rose of the World, Australia !*? There
is good matter, too, in 326, but too many
words end in ‘ust.’ And 110 (Ell-Ell) calls
for consideration, if the writer could recast
the last two lines of stanza 1. It would
then, in my opinion, stand high for first
place.”
The plan adopted was to make the entries
available to Professor Brereton and Mr.
Ross Thomas first. It was found that Pro-
fessor Brereton had placed 150 first and
Mr. Thomas had placed it equal with 501
for first place if 792 was not eligible on
account of the defect noted. This being
communicated to them, Mr. Thomas agreed
that 150 should be placed first and 792
second, and that 828, 501, 492, 326 and 110
should be awarded the other prizes. This
was communicated to Dr. Orchard, who had
asked to be regarded primarily as a musi-
cian. Therefore the verses sent to Dr.
Orchard were those which the other judges
had mentioned—with an intimation, of
course, that all the others were open to
him. His report follows:
“I have been able to give a lot of considera-
tion to the songs forwarded, and at the end
of it all find myself wondering if the result
of the competition, as it stands, is good
enough. I looked for something sturdier,
something with a rugged strength that I
feel to be more consistent with the char-
acteristics of this country. I am wholly
with Professor Brereton in considering No.
501, ‘Australia,’ the best of the bunch —it
is all he says it is, yet it is not strong or
big enough. So the question arises, are you
bound by your conditions to give it the prize
merely because it is the best of those sub-
mitted? If so, it certainly wins—without
consideration of the musical aspect. I agree
with Professor Brereton that ‘star-crossed’
must be altered. Further, I do not like
‘Empire grand,’ which is feeble and an
obvious concession to rhyme.
‘.‘May I suggest that The Bulletin call
for further effort? Better to wait another
year or even two to get the right thing,
rather than speed towards a failure!
“As to the musical possibilities, No. 501
could be set, though to make an effective
strophic setting would require a lot of man-
agement. Due to the brevit y of space between
the first and last words of each stanza, the
possibilities of a satisfactory climax are re-
mote. The word ‘Australia’ needs careful
handling. There is only one way to treat
that difficult word, and it can be found in the
treatment of the words ‘Gloria’ and ‘Alleluia’
in the great tune sung by the clergy and
soldiers at Agincourt. In a brief space the
music is virile and strong, and the refrain,
in a few notes, seems to reach back over the
centuries. Too old for us, you say, but is
it? The latest viewpoint would appear to
regard this country as an old one. The
shortest tune to a national anthem known
to me is that of Japan. But that is solemn
and almost tragic in character, and the space
covered is about the same as that of 501.
It is quite possible to set these words, but
the results might be of the brief hymn-tune
type. To make a setting of continuous music
covering the first two stanzas, repeating the
same music for the third and fourth, would
kill the sense of the words, as each stanza, as
it were, tells its own story. I think it would
be impossible to set 792 to music satisfac-
torily for a national song. A musician would
have to carry on the running lines, and that
would kill if from a popular point of view.
“In my own mind I have set 501 several
times, yet not once to my liking, and, I
think, because of the reasons I have given.
Of course, someone else may succeed, but it
will not be easy. There would be an element
of luck if it did become a popular success. So
I trust you will announce that, as nothing
entirely satisfactory has been sent in, you
intend giving a further opportunity, in the
hope of getting nearer the mark.
“After all, the Austrian and Russian
(Czarist) national anthems were made to
order. The French was an extraordinary
accident, though, by the way, if any com-
petitor sent in such a long tune, -with an
unusual modulation in the middle of it, the
chances would be against it winning the
prize. Association with such an epoch as
that which gave it birth has made it live.
Our own tune undoubtedly goes back to
mediaeval times.”
THE AWARDS.
Dr. Orchard thus suggests that the selec-
tion of a national song should be post-
poned for 12 months. This, of course, is not
for The Bulletin to decide. All it can
do is to distribute the prizes which it
offered. It may be that later on a further
appeal will be made.
The awards are therefore as follows:
“Australia,” White li'eather (501), Mrs.
C. M. Richardson, Glen Iris (Vic.) .. 1
“An Australian Anthem,” Obadiah M.
(702), D. P. McGuire, Largs Bay,

(150), Rev. W. Deane, Chatswood

“Our Pledge to Thee,” Dairyfarmer (326),
R. J. Godfrey, Murray Bridge (S.A.). f

AN AUSTRALIAN ANTHEM.
God give us greatness for our task,
For our great task but entered on ;
Crown it with splendor, Lord, we ask,
The splendor of our southern sun.
Make us, with proud uplifted eyes
And strength of mind and strength of hand,
Ardent for our great enterprise:
To hold and make this land our land.
O Land that toe have loved and known!
O fair brave country! We will make
Your beauty and your strength our own!
Let us be worthy for your sake!
Honored above all other men
In our great task : an honored name,
A trumpet to the alien,
God grant us, and a noble fame.
From coast to coast we shall be free,
Deserving freedom; we shall rise
Strong from our labor: there shall be
On us the splendor of our skies.
0 Land that we have loved and known!
0 fair brave country! We will make
Your beauty and your strength our own!
Let us be worthy for your sake!
OBADIAII M. (D. P. McGuire).
ALL FOR THEE, AUSTRALIA.
Land of right and liberty,
From encircling sea to sea,
Hearts of freemen beat for thee,
All for thee, Australia!
Shining with thy skies of blue
All the splendid spaces through,
Thou shalt find us ever true
All for thee, Australia!
They who died beyond the wave,
Beautiful and young and brave,
Still are with us, strong to save—
All for thee, Australia !
See their marching banners fly
With the starry cross on high,
Calling us to live and die,
All for thee, Australia !
Where our British fathers stood
Nobly for the Right and Good,
Still we stand, in brotherhood,
All for thee, Australia!
God of nations grant that we
Worthy of our lot shall be,
Truly great and truly free—
All for thee, Australia !
ACACIA (H. E. Horne).
LAND OF THE GOLDEN WATTLE.
Land of the Golden Wattle,
Home of a race new-born.
Deep in our hearts are thrilling
Pulses of life at morn.
Here with our eyes uplifted,
Viewing thy hills of gold,
Pledge we our love unsullied,
Pledge we our courage bold.
Australia! Australia !
Like as the golden eagle
Mounts to thy azure skies,
Upwards our vision glances,
Yearn we on wings to rise.
What though the storm winds threaten?
What though the oceans roar?
Hope we in thee, Australia;
Trust we for evermore.
Australia! Australia!
Father of all, we praise Thee,
Praise Thee for this fair land!
Oh, make our hearts more worthy,
Guide us in heart and hand.
Swift as the wild bird speedetli,
May we be swift for Thee;
Temper our land with mercy.
Great may her future be !
Australia! Australia!
SENESOHAL ( W. Deane).
AUSTRALIA.
Land that we love —Australia !
Stretching through every clime,
Burning breath of the desert,
Snow of the heights sublime;
Palms and pearls of the Northland,
Oaks of the shy, cool South,
Forests that clothe the mountains,
Plains that perish with drouth!
Place in the sun—Australia!
Here mav the Wand’rer’s Race
Build them a noble nation,
Rich in thy far-flung space.
Making the desert blossom,
Bringing thee wheat and wine,
Flocks to feed on thy hillsides,
Mingling their gifts with thine.
Rose of the World —Australia !
Set in the farthest sea,
Home of the Youngest Nation,
God send prosperity!
Make, us a w’ise, proud people,
Heirs of a noble name,
Hating alien evil.
Guarding our Father’s fame.
Lift up thy heart, Australia,
Unto thy Father’s God.
His right hand shall exalt thee;
Comfort with staff and rod.
He is thy strength and wisdom;
Mighty to save is He.
Justice, mercy and freedom
He shall secure to thee.
DEYON (E. A. Brady).
OUR PLEDGE TO THEE!
O land unsoar red with war or shame.
Where freemen have no fear to dwell,
Whose flag, bright-starred with Anzac fatae
, ® loats free o’er land and ocean swell,
If faith can conquer lust and hate,
And love inspire our measures just,
\V e need not fear thy fame or fate,
Who hold a heritage in trust!
0 sweet land, complete land ,
Encompassed by the sea .
As did our fathers, toiling, die,
We pledge our lives to thee!
There’s glowing purple on thy peaks
And homesteads nestling in the sun •
O er golden beds and silver, creeks
With laughter and with music run •
A myriad beauties star thy dust
Thy giories stretch from plain to plain •
We will not falter with our trust - -
JNor mar our standard with one’stain
0 rare land , o fair land,
Encompassed by the sea,
Proud of our heritage and trust,
We pledge our lives to thee!
DAIRYFARMER (R. J. Godfrey).
SONG OF AUSTRALIA.
Far in the quiet of thy forested deepness,
Over the widest expanse of thy plains,
Blazing a trail o’er thy mountainous steep-
ness,
Pioneers purchased thy life with their
pains;
Strong in their spirit, courageous to do,
They gave you being, Australia the New!
Land of the gum-blossom, land of the wattle !
Land of blue distance and far misty range !
Land of cool gullies, where giant trees mottle
Fern that is greenest with shadows that
change!
Land of soft dawning and still evening air!
Beauty incarnate, Australia the Fair!
Harsh rang the bugles, disturbing thy
dreaming;
Swift sprang thy sons in defence of the
right-
Strong still of spirit, with high courage
gleaming,
Bright as thy cross in the blue southern
night.
Dared they the tempest—nor shrank they,
nor bowed;
Made you a nation, Australia the Proud!
Strengthen, the bonds of thy dearness that
bind us
Close to thy earth. Make us sturdy and
brave.
Still let the deeds of thy dead sons remind
us
Ours is the task to conserve what they
gave.
Live we in brotherhood, casting out hate!
So may we make thee Australia the Great!
ELL-ELL (Lloyd Williams).
A Satchel of Books
Dent’s amazing Everyman’s Library has
grown to such dimensions since its founder,
J. M. Dent, started 26 years ago with the
issue of a mere 153 volumes that it now
demands a 250-page “Reader’s Guide.” All
languages and ages are levied upon and the
editors are always specialists. The latest of
the series are Richardson’s Clarissa, in four
volumes, with nothing altered but the punc-
tuation and some of the spelling, and
Burton’s Anatomy of Melancholy , with an
introduction by Holbrook Jackson.
The Dog's Medical Dictionary (George
Routledge and Sons; Dymocks; 7s. 6d.)
first appeared in 1906, and it has been re-
printed several times since. This edition has
been revised and largely rewritten by F. W.
Cousens, M.R.C.V.S., Canine Surgeon to
the King and the Prince of Wales. The
causes, symptoms and treatment of every
ailment that a dog can contract —and their
number is surprising—are presented con-
cisely yet comprehensively. Invaluable to
dog-owners who love their dogs.
The Poetry of T. 8■ Eliot, by Hugh Ross
Williamson (Hodder and Stoughton; 55.).
An appreciation of Harvard’s distinguished
Professor of Poetry by a warm admirer.
Much of it —altogether too much —consists
of sneers at “Georgians.” Brooke suffered
from “a plethora of adjectives”; Fletcher
was a minor poet; Drinkwater in a poem
which “shows the ‘Georgians’ at their best
.... produces the unctuous effect of a church
organ.” Eliot, this author says, has suffered
because critics in key positions are them-
selves “Georgians”; they will be dismissed
for ever as the negligible versifiers they are
when he comes to be understood. If you can
swallow the premise you will enjoy the
spirited arguments by which it is supported.
The Story of Princess Elizabeth (with
Some. Stories of Princess Margaret), by
Anne Ring (John Murray; 2s. 6d.). This
little book about the most photographed
and paragraphed little girls in the world
should be absorbing to those who are inter-
ested in gossip on the subject of the British
royal family. The children don’t say or do
anything remarkable, but they are shown
in splendid and romantic surroundings. The
photographs in rotogravure are very attrac-
tive.
“Wild Rye,” Muriel Hine’s last book which
was reviewed on this page, left Jenny Rorke
deserted by Thad for worthless Linda Fir-
kett. In Jenny Rorke (The Bodley
Head; 7s. 6d.) the ill-treated girl is seven
years older, and the paid companion on the
Italian farm of her middle-aged American
friend Camilla Lyle. The story moves
against an Italian background. The peasants
are not the amoral hedonists that writers
like Aldous Huxley and James Aston des-
cribe, but they live and are highly enter-
taining, and no one knows the English-
speaking folks who are attracted to Italy
better than Miss Hine. _ Linda reappears
towards the end, a disillusioned woman.
She has gone to Filipe, a Spaniard, after
being deserted by the deplorable Thad. And
then Jenny finds happiness of a sort. A
sound novel, with an interesting and in all
respects credible plot.
The Romantic Quest of Peter Lamonte, by
James Francis Dwyer (Sampson Low:
Robertson and Mullens; 7s. 6d.), concerns
an assistant in a London bookshop who is
a troubadour at heart. For seven years he
saved and then he was able to journey to
the land of his heart’s desire, which ’was
Provence. He meets the Girl almost at once.
“Would you —would you play for Uncle John?”
she cried. “He loves music. Would you? I—l
could pay you something—something for your
trouble.”
Amazing adventures follow which culminate
in a dastardly attempt by Horace Earl, the
Girl’s stepfather, to kidnap her in Marseilles
and her rescue by Peter. Later she brings
Peter joyous news in the disjointed manner
of speech which distinguishes both of them.
“We —we have been hunting everywhere for you.
Grandfather wants you—wants you to do some work
for him! He told me so! Peter, Peter, you—
you will, won’t you?”
Only one answer was possible.
“If you—if you want me to stay near you 1
will gladly,” said Peter in a choked whisper. “I ,•
want to walk —to walk with you through all the
years of my life.”
BRAWL AT A TENT SHOW.
A gang of hoodiiurns invaded the tent;
The spectators in alarm did "retreat.
Off a barrel a clown was knocked,
And did land like a bird on his feet.
The proprietor, a man of physical strength
Who’d fought in the arena prize-ring,
Battered a tough with a upper-cut,
Left-hook and heavy right-swing.
As an assailant clashed with a ‘acrobat,
The pride of the show, a big coon,
Poundered and hurled the fiend out,
To revive ’neath the light of the moon.
A bottle aimed at the bandsman’s head
Knocked a hole thro’ his well-slogged drum ;
“The blanky skunk,’’ he did fiercely blurt;
“By God, I will make things hum.”
He wrested a trombone from his pal
And rushed forth with a frenzied yell,
Raised a hump on a couple of heads,
When like a soldier in action he fell.
Prone in a faint lay Tottie the star,
When from oblivion they brought her;
The proprietor gently raised her head,
While the acrobat sprayed her with water.

THE REVERSION TO BARTER.
"Recently Brazil offered coffee for Oil, Russia proposed to batter oil with Canada for cows. Canada proposes to barter wheat with Russia for other goods,
Professor Graham, of Princeton University, proposes an elaborate system of barter in the U.S.A., until the currency system can be reorganised.”

THE FARMER AND HIS DEBTS.
What are we going to do about these
farmers? What really is their position?
And is it different from that of other
people? In considering these questions, it
seems necessary to realise that the average
land-man is up against two difficulties. In
the first place, he is suffering from a great
fall in prices; and, in the second, he is
suffering from a crushing burden of debt.
As to the fall in prices, it is quite true
that others are in the same boat. But has
the wind been tempered to the farmer as
it has been to others? Turn to the excel-
lent “Monthly Summary” published by the
N.S.'W’. Government Statistician for evidence
on that point. Wool worth £lOO in 1911
was worth £96 in November, 1932; wheat
worth £lOO in 1911 was worth £B3 in Novem-
ber. But non-rural products, almost ex-
clusively manufactured goods, worth £lOO
in 1911 were worth £175 in November.
This means, generally, that, whereas the
non-rural worker can get 75 p.c. more for
his product (which is mostly his labor)
than he could in 1911, the wheat-farmer
gets 17 p.c. less. It means also that for
what he must buy from the city the wheat-
farmer must pay more than two bushels of
wheat where in 1911 he had to pay only one.
It is quite obvious that the fall in prices
has not hit us all alike.
The explanation lies partly in the superior
organisation of the non-rural producers and
partly in the tariff. The tariff was built
on the foundation that it is better to pay
ourselves 30s. for an article than to get it
from somebody else at 20s. That it would
put up prices—in the beginning at any rate
—we knew quite well; there was no sense
in it if it didn’t. But the farmer has to sell
on a Freetrade basis and buy on a Protec-
tionist one. He does not get the Protec-
tionist price even for such of his products
as are sold for home consumption. This is
unfair; and the farmer will have serious
cause for complaint until he can get as a
producer the benefit of the Protection for
which he has to pay as a consumer. Thus
far the only practicable plan proposed is
to give him the benefit of a sales tax.
It is complained that this will put up the
cost of living. Of course it will. But that
does not stop us from imposing tariff duties;
indeed, as we have just seen, it is what
we put them on for—that the competition
of the outsider may not prevent us from
raising prices. Nor is this subsidy—call it
what you like—the fanner’s due in depres-
sion times only. Special grants, given virtu-
ally as doles, are an insult to the whole
farming population.
The problem of the land-man’s debts is
more difficult; and the difficulty is part
of the price we pay for our land-booming
habits. So high do we thrust up the price
of land, or permit it to be thrust, that
the farmer has to be a capitalist in order
to make any sort of a start at all. Without
capital the best farmer in Australia cannot
be a farmer. He can scarcely be even a
farm laborer; for as farms have been sub-
divided and the industry has been more and
more mechanised, the demand for per-
manent farm hands—away, of course, from
the grazing country—has almost dis-
appeared. Now, all this constitutes a con-
dition that we have been trying to hide
even from ourselves, and to circumvent.
With this purpose we have set up rural
banks and rural industry boards and
advances to settlers departments, all strug-
gling to enable the competent man to be
a farmer although he is not a capitalist—
all struggling to sustain the fiction that
“anybody can become a farmer in Aus-
tralia.” And the ordinary trading banks
have joined in. If none of these things were
done—if only men with the money to buy
the things necessary for a farmer went in
for farming—probably a full two-thirds of
the farms in Australia would be vacant.
These are the circumstances which mark
off the land industries from all others.
The competent tradesman can start off with
no other equipment than a small kit of
tools—in many cases without even that.
The professional man may have to buy
a brass plate. The farmer not only must
acquire a very expensive kit of tools —his
plant—but must get command of country.
He may be able to rent some; but except
“on the shares” there is very little tenant-
farming in Australia. In other industries
or in trade a man may form a company
to provide the capital which he needs and
has not got himself; anything of that sort
is quite out of the question so far as the
farmer—the wheat-farmer especially—is
concerned. In 19 cases out of 20 he is
simply driven to borrow in order to make
a start. Which means, of course, higher
prices than would be given if hard cash
were paid.
The whole system is bad), and The
Bulletin knows no one cure for the disease.
But we can do a good deal to reduce its
bad effects; and the most effective thing
of all is to prick every little land-boom
bubble. That, however, will not relieve the
men who are over-heavily burdened to-day.
Thus far most of the effort has been towards
securing postponements of their capital
debts. But we shall not get confidence
and content that way. It may be hard for
mortgagees to face the facts and do heroic
writing-down; but they are probably losing
money by not doing it. If they could keep
the old debts alive and at the same time
preserve the material assets, it might be
foolish policy to forgive any part of the
debt. But if inaction means neglect of
material assets and the discontent and
demoralisation of valuable clients, then it
would be better to do quickly what may
have to be done in any case, and write
down these debts to something more like
modern values.
MORE DOUGLAS CREDIT.
Montague Grover is still full of fight:—
The Bulletin (28/12/’32), in its re-
joinder to my mild remarks about Douglas
Credit and the failure of the distributive
system, has thrown out enough bones of
contention to stock an outsize cemetery.
Douglas himself would have to turn out
another half-dozen volumes to demolish all
the arguments which The Bulletin has
put forward or inferred in that half-column
of miraculous condensation. Still, I’ll do
my best.
I am chided because the “Commonwealth
Year Book” did not include profits among
the items in the money available for spend-
ing-power. I didn’t write the “C.Y.8.”;
all I did was to quote it, comparing it with,
the A + B theorem of Douglas which has
excited so much indignation. In the theorem
Douglas does definitely include profits in
the form of dividends, and, as The Bulle-
tin will have none of the theorem, I pro-
duced another authority. You can’t have
it both ways.
Towards the end of its footnote, The
Bulletin makes some calculations which
prove to its satisfaction that the un-
accounted balance shows that the profits of
Australian industry amounted to 55 p.c. It
then proceeds to ridicule such a possibility,
and says that it should be "apparent to me.
It is; and that is the strongest point of my
argument. Profits during the period under
consideration are not likely to have averaged
10 p.c., which means that the people of the
Commonwealth were short by 45 p.c. in the
amount necessary to purchase their own
products.
The opening sentences of The Bulletin’s
rejoinder consist of undeniable truths; but
the reference to the producer buying a
motor-truck with an overdraft of £650 is
unfortunate. If that producer bought the
truck when wheat was 7s. 6d., the bank
was giving him about £5OO in reality; *and,
now that wheat is about 2s. 6d., it is asking
him for the money back. It does not ask for
payment in wheat (the producer’s, currency)
but in money (the bank’s currency), and the
result is that the producer 'to-day does not
repay the £650 he borrowed, but three times
£650, or £1950. Added to which is the
fact that the hank never advanced any real
money at all. but merely a book-keeping
entry which inflated the general currency of
the country. It was, in fact, bootleg money
privately, though legally, distilled in the
directors’ room of the bank.
The Bulletin added some kindly words
about my recent illness which I greatly
appreciate; but I don’t appreciate the argu-
ment that Douglas’s effort to right the
world’s finance is tantamount to my having
employed a “well-meaning quack.” The body
politic, unlike the human body, is a com-
plicated affair of which man can never
know really much. Economics is an exact
science, or would be if the professors and
publicists and bankers would let it. For
their own ends, they scare the public off
something that is merely a matter of simple
arithmetic—and very simple at that—by
the use of uncouth phrases and bad English.
Douglas is a man who has approached the
subject in the way that he approached his
own profession of engineering. He has
worked out the foot-pounds and the break-
ing-strains and the limits of elasticity with
the cold, logical brain of the scientist. He
may be wrong in some of his details of
administration—l think he is—but he has
developed his scheme as Henry jFord de-
veloped the scheme of his plant, not as the
orthodox economists do in their junk-shop
garages. The “trained physician” which
The Bulletin advises for illness resembles
Douglas more closely than the medical clair-
voyance of Professor Copland or the Chinese
herbalism of Otto Niemeyer.
In conclusion, I would point out to The
Bulletin’s conservative friends that if
they don’t accept the advice of Douglas
or somebody else like him they’re going
to have the Soviet world-wide. With modern
appliances, one breadwinner can provide
sufficient for four, which means that a
truly efficient Australia would not have
300,000 people out of work but 4,500,000,
subsisting on the dole from the taxed wages
of the 1,500,000 working—which is impos-
sible.
If I may be permitted to give Douglasites
a tip, I would advise them to read The
Bulletin’s leader, “1932-33,” the article
following the leader and the first two articles
in Plain English of the issue of 28/12/’32.
Every one of these contains a number of
excellent arguments for advancing the cause
of Douglas.
And The Bulletin replies:—
Douglas says, according to Grover, that
“wages, salaries and dividends of any indus-
try—and of all industries —do not suffice
to buy the products of the industry.” Grover
then quoted somebody who excludes divi-
dends from a total- in order to prove that
Douglas is right. It isn’t The Bulletin
that wants to have it both ways. It is Mr.
Grover. Major Douglas says a horse with
four legs can’t run a mile in five minutes.
Then somebody amputates a leg, sends the
maimed crock off on a mile course, finds it
takes six minutes to do the journey and
cries triumphantly that the test shows
Douglas was right and that a horse can’t
run a mile in five minutes.
The story on which Mr. Grover relied,
told in his own words, was: “In 1931 the
value of goods produced in Australia, with
imports added and exports deducted,
amounted to £393,989,000; while during the
same period the known purchasing-power
of the people of Australia, made up of wages,
salaries, expenditure on Federal and State
loans and gold produced, amounted to only
£254,270,275, leaving Australia nearly
£140,000,000 short of the amount necessary
to purchase its own productions.” The
Bulletin showed (B. 28/12/’32) that
many things provide purchasing-power be-
sides “wages, expenditure on
Federal and State loans and gold produced.”
It showed (1) that every payment made
represents purchasing-power, and (2) that
in the 393 millions the only item which
does not represent payment actually made
is the percentage, if any, added for profit,
including interest on owner’s invested capi-
tal. It therefore said that if the payments
actually made in producing goods valued at
393 millions totalled only 254 millions, then
the balance must be owner’s profit. But
as we know that the owner didn’t make
55 p.c., then it follows that something is
wrong with the two totals quoted by Mr.
Grover. What is wrong, of course, is that
Mr. Grover’s authority didn’t include many
items , which should be included, and whose
inclusion would swell the total far beyond
254 millions. The fact which these gentle-
men don’t realise (and this is the cause of
all the trouble) is that every payment made
in producing goods valued at 393 millions
represents purchasing-power; that of all the
items making up the 393 millions the only
one that does not represent payment made
and, therefore, purchasing power is owner’s
profit; and that if no owner’s profit has
been added to the production cost of the
goods,_ then enough purchasing-power -has
been issued to take up the whole of the
goods.
What Mr. Grover has to say about the
fall in prices has nothing whatever to do
with the case. It is quite true that many
an unfortunate farmer has to-day to pay
three bushels of wheat to meet a debt which
would have been met with one bushel when
he incurred it. But it is equally true that
a _ few years ago he could have paid off
with one bushel a debt which would have
been worth three bushels when he incurred
it. What the world needs is a stable cur-
rency, so that there shall not be at one
time an enormous excess of purchasing-
power (in other words, a boom) and at
another an enormous deficiency of purchas-
ing-power (that is, a slump). What Major
Douglas affirms is that there is a deficiency
all the time, and in the very nature of
things. He has invented an elaborate plan
for getting over_ a difficulty which thus
doesn’t always exist. His cure is all wrong
because his diagnosis is all wrong.
Finally, as for the story that “with modern
appliances one breadwinner can provide suffi-
cient for four.” He can provide for 49
if they are satisfied with little enough.
But if everybody were to have only one-
quarter as much as a few now enjoy, then
one needn’t be afraid of ever running out of
a job.
FIVE MONTHS’ TRADE.
For the first five months of this financial
year our exports of merchandise were worth
only. £2,656,000 more than our imports, as
against a surplus of £9,413,000 in the corre-
sponding months of last year. Add our gold
production exported, £2,420,000, and we have
a total export surplus of £5,076,000 as
against £11,902,000 last year—all figures in
sterling. Our exports of merchandise are,
however, a shade better than those of last
year; if we can maintain the same propor-
tionate increase of 6 p.c. we shall finish up
the year with £91,940,000 of merchandise
exports and probably £5,800,000 of gold and
bullion—a- total of £97,740,000. Our im-
ports for the five months were £25,991,000,
and they have been steadily increasing; in
January, 1932,,they were £3,327,000 and in
November £5,662,000, the highest for any
month since November, 1930. If the
November figure should be the average for
the year—which will allow of a small in-
crease during the following months—the
total merchandise imports for the year will
be £67,952,000. Assuming that the exports
can be brought up to £97,740,000 as pre-
viously estimated, we shall have a surplus
of £29,788,000 sterling, which will be just
about sufficient to pay our interest bill;
our public debt calls for about 27 millions
and our private debt will absorb most of the
balance.
Thh figures are better than they promised
to be a month or two ago; but the great
increase in the imports is still disturbing.
Fortunately, thanks to the tight rein that
was kept on imports last year, the Common-
wealth Bank holds £13,888,000 in London;
but against that has to be set the fact
that a large sum payable for imports has
been left in Australia, in the hope that it
would presently cost less to send it away.
In any case, it is eminently desirable that
the London reserve should not be seriously
cut into; which means that a close watch
must be kept on our trade figures. If
our imports continue to rise, then the
proper course will be to restore some of
those prohibitions which were previously so
effective.
WHAT SHOULD EDUCATION AIM AT?
For centuries national superiority had been
determined on the battlefield, but during
the last half-century men’s minds generally
became convinced of the futility and
wickedness of war. The Great War was a
reversion to the older method of decision.
Drunk with the sight of power and a belief
in their country’s invincibility, based on
the memory of two swift victories in the
field, the German rulers were led away
from the path of reason. The German
school and the German workshop were in
the van, but the nation’s leaders were im-
patient for results, and their appeal was
to the sword. Defeat shattered their
dreams, but was really only an incident in
the campaign. With a return to the school
and the workshop the victory may yet be
theirs.
With us of late the question of education
has come into prominence, not through any
statesmanlike recognition of its import-
ance, but in a somewhat sordid scramble
for pence. No sane person would argue that
at any time money should be squandered on
education, but a true economy must have
regard for efficiency, and even in a time of
financial stringency only folly would sug-
gest the sacrifice of the indispensable. The
defeat at Jena seemed to mark the nadir
of Prussian fortunes, but it heralded the
establishment of the finest system of
national education in Europe; and the
Fisher Education Act, with its manifold
blessings, was passed by the British Parlia-
ment at a time when the country was
engaged in a death-grapple with the great-
est military power the world has ever seen.
We in our time of trial, instead of wel-
coming to the schools the unemployed of
all ages and both sexes, are utterly unmind-
ful of the menace of to-morrow, and limit
educational facilities on every hand. Quite
apart from the inevitable moral degenera-
tion consequent on prolonged idleness,
what standard of industrial efficiency can
be expected from minds so stunted and hands
untrained when, later, the workshop calls,
as call it must? What a prostrate German
nation saw, and what England recognised in
her darkest hour, was that, if the loss were
to be repaired, not merely normal but ex-
traordinary capacity would be needed on
the morrow.
With us, too, some special educational pro-
gramme is called for now; but, as a prelimi-
nary, there should be some form of stock-
taking. How far has our system of national
education been responsible for the present
unsatisfactory condition of things? What
amendments are necessaiy to increase its
efficiency? One such inquiry has already
been made, but the Commission was limited
in its capacity and scope, and its findings
were consequently of little value. It was
avowedly an “economy” Commission,
charged with suggesting ways in which the
expenditure on public education could be
reduced. But an increase of expenditure
may, at times, be a wise economy.
A committee to which any inquiry on
public education could with' confidence be
entrusted should be composed of leading
educationists and prominent business men
who have shown a special interest in educa-
tion. The tendency in the past has been to
rely too much on expert opinion. The
opinions of experts who are familiar with
the achievements in education and the trend
of educational thought in the leading
countries of the world must always com-
mand respect; but the schools are ulti-
mately to be judged by the type of citizen
they turn out. Of his fitness and general
worth the public is the judge. Our edu-
cation system has enjoyed the approval
of the experts; but what has the public to
say? Compulsory national education has
been established in Victoria for some 60
years, and after so complete a trial the
community is entitled to weigh it in the
balance. The great majority of our citizens
to-day owe their education to the State
schools. These schools have had.at their
disposal raw material equal to the best in
the world, and the finished product should
be equal to any. What do we find? No
lover of his country can contemplate with
satisfaction the present standards of life
and conduct in the community, or be opti-
mistic about the future.
It is not our business to apportion blame.
What we seek to discover is whether these
blameworthy traits can with justice be
ascribed to any defects in school curricula,
and, if so, how these defects can be
remedied. Are subjects not taught that
should be taught? Is too much attempted?
Complaints from teachers are not infre-
quent that the programme is overloaded—
that sufficient time cannot be found for
essential subjects. The statement pro-
vokes the question, What right has any
subject not essential to a place on the pro-
gramme at all? What are these essentials?
The schools are the laboratories of citizen-
ship, and only so far as it conduces to that
end can the inclusion of any subject in
the State curriculum be justified. In that
light the teaching of our national schools
may well be reviewed.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
National Songs.
. Generally speaking, national songs are
chosen something like wives; which means
that they are really not chosen at all. A
young man may make up his mind that
the girl he wants has blue eyes and fair
hair, and talks brilliantly about art and
literature; and presently he finds himself
being married by a dark-eyed brunette who
is inarticulate. She may be in every way
unlike the wife he had pictured; yet if he
is wise—and especially if she is wise—he
will straightway begin to persuade himself
that she is just what he really wanted,
though so unlike what he thought he
wanted. National songs and anthems are
for. the most part accidents of the same
sort, fastening themselves upon a people,
who proceed to attach to them virtues
which they don’t possess; but in time they
do possess, by association, a value which
something newer and infinitely better could
not have.
It is so with the British National
Anthem—a poor thing in almost every
way, yet not to be given up even though
the nation were offered in its place the
greatest masterpiece” of poet and musician.
Even the Frenchman’s passionately-loved
“Marseillaise,” though it has many finer
technical qualities than our own hymn,
has its serious defects. “If any competitor
sent in such a long tune, with an unusual
modulation in the middle of it, the chances
would be against it winning the prize,”
Dr. Arundel Orchard writes on the Red
Page to-day. And poor as the tune of
“God Save the King” may be, so strength-
ened has it been by its associations that
Germany sang its “Heil der im Siegeskranz”
to the same tune, and Switzerland sings
also its “Rufst du, mein Vaterland,” and
Denmark its “Heil der, dem Liebenden.”
Had some homesick Digger in France
written even a poor thing but with the
throb of patriotism in it, and if by some
lucky accident it had caught on among the
boys, to-day we should not be searching for
an Australian national song. However, the
occasion passed without the lucky accident:
we could hardly adapt and transplant
“Mademoiselle of Armentieres.”
Whether the competition which The
Bulletin promoted will help towards the
choice of a national song seems at the
moment doubtful. As the reports printed
on the Red Page show, Mr. Ross Thomas,
Director of Education in N. S. Wales,
cannot find among the entries an outstand-
ing contribution; and Dr. Orchard, Director
of the N.S.W. State Conservatorium, an-
other of the judges, is so little in love with
what he has read that he thinks the selec-
tion of a national song might well be held
over. “Better,” he urges, “to wait for an-
other year, or even two, to get the right
thing.” And he adds the encouraging reflec-
tion that, though most national songs have
been accidents, they have not all been.
“After all,” he reminds us, “the Austrian
and Russian (Czarist) National Anthems
were made to order.” At any rate, the com-
petition, even if it has not produced any-
thing very outstanding (though it has
indeed produced much good verse), has
drawn widespread attention to Australia’s
need of a national song that will be accept-
able in every State and will be sung
throughout the schools. The need being
thus made known, the work may be forth-
coming: and a formal competition should
not be necessary to evoke it.
—‘ O
The League of Rail-sitters.
Lawyers had very little to do with the
drafting of the Covenant of the League of
Nations. Its essential provisions were
framed by non-legal idealists such as Wood-
row Wilson, Hugh Cecil and Botha; and
a very fine example of plain English and
equally clear French it is. The parties
agreed, in terms which seemed to admit of
not the slightest misconception or equivoca-
tion, that they would submit their disputes
to arbitration and would not resort to war
until three months after an award by arbi-
trators or a report of the Council (Article
XII). And a plain duty was imposed on
all members of the League to sever trade
and financial relations with any member
that resorted to war in disregard of the
covenants, and to co-operate in coercive
military and naval measures against the
offender (Article XVI).
When the acid test was put on these
solemn covenants by the Japanese invasion
of China for purposes of conquest, it was
suddenly discovered that they could be
made to mean nothing whatever on grounds
quite outside the Covenant. Foremost of
these grounds was that it was quite permis-
sible, and even commendable, to proceed
with horse, foot and guns into the territory
of any member of the League if the aggres-
sive member of the League considered that
the other member’s Government or form of
government was inefficient in the matter of
preserving law and order. The point is of
importance to Australia. There is a small
section of our community which makes a
specialty of breaking the windows of foreign
Consulates. On the Sino-Japanese prece-
dent this may be taken by the Council
of the League as-evidence that our Govern-
ment can’t or won’t protect foreigners
within. our borders, and may lead it to
restrict its activities in the matter to a
restrained and disinterested discussion of
the possibility of reconciling us with an
invader a year after he has annexed half
our territory, bombed some of our principal
cities and seized some of our seaports.
The trouble with the League, of course,
is that very few politicians have the slight-
est sympathy with its objects. The gentle-
men who signed the Covenant at Versailles
did so because the President of the United
States insisted upon it. When the United
States repudiated its President and his
Covenant, the League lost its only friend in
a sceptical world. The Covenant has
now been disowned and repudiated by every
member of the League save China. The
Council, instead of telling Japan to get
out of China and stay out, and imposing
the penalty of an economic and financial
boycott on the offender pending its de-
cison regarding the dispute, tells the world
every day it neglects to do these things
that its object is not to “achieve inter-
national peace”; not to “respect and pre-
serve the territorial integrity and existing
political independence of all members of
the League”; not to concern itself with, “a
scrupulous respect for all treaty obliga-
tions,” but to wash its hands as expediti-
ously as possible of all responsibility in a
case where one of its strong members
attacks a very weak one. If the League
were as Wilson, Cecil and Botha dreamed
it, the weakness of China would be the
strongest of all reasons for powerful and
effective intervention. As things are, it
looks as if the League could only be ex-
pected to exert itself in a case where it
was perfectly certain that the aggrieved
Power could wallop the aggressor and most
of the other members of the League with
one hand tied. In other circumstances it
is a League of Rail-sitters.

Killing No Manslaughter.
In Perth last August a bookmaker, driving
a car, tried to pass another car going the
same way. In doing so he took the wrong
side, and crashed into a lorry coming in his
direction. It was laden with footballers,
and in the collision three of the party,
including the driver, were killed; other
people in both vehicles were hurt.
The bookmaker was arrested on a charge
of manslaughter. He pleaded that he had
not seen the lorry when he began his effort
to pass the car in front, that he would
have passed with safety if the man in front
had not accelerated at the same time, and
that he had tried to swing his car away
from the lorry, but something went wrong
with the works, as had happened before.
This, of course, was no defence at all. The
man had no right to be on the roads in a
car with defective gear; most certainly he
had no right to be where he was at the
fatal moment. Yet one jury failed to
agree, a second .was discharged for the same
reason, and a third pronounced the accused
guiltless.
This startling assertion of the doctrine
that the car-driver can do no wrong may be
considered in conjunction with the reports
of holiday accidents from Perth. On Boxing
Day, it is recorded, “John Johnson, aged
77, was knocked down by a car. He was
picked up by another motorist, but died in
hospital.” In the evening, “Mrs. Marion
Sassen was walking with her three children
at Maylands, accompanied by Mrs. Shen-
berg, when a car struck them. Mrs. Sassen.
who was carrying a baby, died almost im-
mediately, and the baby received concus-
sion. Rosie Sassen (two years) sustained
head injuries, Rachael Sassen (seven) a
probable fracture of the skull, and Mrs.
Shenberg severe shock. The driver, a bar-
man, was arrested on a charge of driving
while drunk, and of killing Mrs. Sassen.”
About the same time “Charles Jenkins and
his wife were wheeling their children, aged
nine months and two years, in a peram-
bulator along Canning-road, when a car
crashed into them from the rear. Mrs.
Jenkins escaped uninjured, but her husband
and children are receiving medical atten-
tion.”
Every year 700 or 800 Australians are
killed and 14,000 or 15,000 hurt in preven-
table motor accidents. Nothing adequate
has been done by the authorities to lessen
this ghastly toll of life and limb. They
don’t even take the trouble to see that
the vehicles - which have made busy
thoroughfares death-traps for the aged, the
young, cripples, limbless soldiers and people
with heart disease are in good going order.
Yet the available evidence suggests that a
large proportion are not; of 506 cars volun-
tarily submitted for tests conducted by the
National Safety Council in Melbourne, only
18.2 p.c. scored full points—32.B p.c. failed
in the braking test, 43.2 p.c. in the steering
test. The National Safety Council is doing
its best, but Australia needs a real national-
safety movement, in which these tests would
be periodical and compulsory; The use of
vehicles with steering or braking gear
known to be defective should mean gaol
without the option.
And Judges should have the power to
inflict the death penalty on the hit-run
driver who kills,. He is a barbarous pro-
duct of the age, and some of the vilest
crimes which have stained the annals of
Australia these last few years have been
committed by drink- and speed-crazed
specimens of the breed.-
:
Motor Transport and Railways.
The International Chamber of Commerce,
whose headquarters are in Paris, has been
considering the problem presented by motor
competition with railways; ,and in October
it held a four-days’ . conference of trans-
port experts . and representatives of trans-
port organisations. On reports from 23
countries it was found that the aim thus far
had been to establish equality between the
two forms of transport, the one calling
for an expensive track specially laid, often
through private property, the other con-
tent to share the general highway. The
steps towards this equalisation were tabu-
lated as follows:
(1) Franchises for motor transport, with the
prohibition of unlicensed vehicles.
(2) Rate schedules, timetables and conditions of
carriage by motor-truck.
(3) Special taxes on motor-transport, ostensibly
for the construction and maintenance of highways.
But the conference was not able to see
much daylight in that direction; it declared
that, although the overwhelming part of
motor transport was in the hands of firms
and individuals carrying their own goods
and products in trucks owned by them-
selves, it would be an unwarranted inter-
ference with private enterprise to impose
restrictions upon any but professional
carriers. The experts were therefore driven
back to the conclusion that “the situation
must be met by the introduction by the
railways themselves of technical improve-
ments and adjustments in their rate
schedules.”
But this conclusion is so general that it
really does not help very much to solve
the problem. It is liable, moreover, to
come into conflict at any moment with
what seems to be the basic fact of the
whole business, as expressed by the chair-
man of the conference, Professor Most:—
As long as the railways are indispensable for
the transport of passengers and goods, the general
interest demands that the foundations of their econo-
mic existence should not be shaken.
Upon that point Australian railway
managers have again and again insisted.
It is beyond all question that our railways
are indispensable for the carriage of wheat
and other bulky farm produce. All adjust-
ments in rate schedules must therefore be
made with the fact in mind that the rail-
ways must be preserved: they are indispen-
sable, and no adjustments can be tolerated
which will imperil “the foundations of
their economic existence.” From that it
seems to follow that if adjustments cannot
be made sufficient to meet motor competi-
tion, then the competition must be in some
way “equalised” by handicapping the motor.
But this is a very unsatisfactory conclusion
to be driven back upon, and technical im-
provements on the railways should be
sought after diligently in order that such
hamstringing of their rival may be avoided.
War Service Homes.
As part of the repatriation policy of the
Commonwealth, returned soldiers were
helped to establish themselves in homes.
Over 40,000 applications were received, and
nearly 30 millions of money was spent on
land and houses and in taking over old
mortgages. When depression hit Australia
it was inevitable that many of these Diggers
would be unable to keep up their pay-
ments. So serious did the position presently
become that a committee was appointed—
all of its members themselves Diggers—to
advise what should be done.
The principal recommendation of this
body was in effect that, where the Com-
missioner was satisfied that a borrower,
though a trier, was unable to keep up his
payments, the term should be extended to
a maximum of 45 years. The Government
consenting, many 'cases have been under
review during the past few months, and
instalments have been substantially reduced
—in some cases they have been even cut in
halves, the term over which payments have
to be made being extended to correspond.
In cases where the Digger’s income has been
so reduced that no payment at all could
be made without family hardship, the Com-
missioner is authorised to leave the occupier
undisturbed—always provided he has a
reasonable prospect of completing the pur-
chase.
From the very nature of the case a large
discretion must be left to the Commis-
sioner; but, knowing what the difficulties
of the times are, knowing also what special
disabilities many of the best of these
Diggers suffer, Australia will be best pleased
if it can be satisfied always that the Com-
missioner is exercising his discretion with
the greatest possible liberality.
To the friends of peace one of the most
hopeful signs of the time must be the care
'and consideration which are still being
given to the returned soldier. A world
which can realise its deep obligation to him,
wounded or well, will surely not lightly
send men to future wars.

Will Westralia Twist?
The Westralian secesssionists are to have
their referendum, and are already boasting
that they will win hands down. Perhaps
they will, but it will be a great reversal
Uf form if they do. For, consistently with
its strong vote for Federation in 1900
(44,800 to 19,691), their State has supported
every proposed extension of Commonwealth
power when the issues were made clear to
the people. At the characteristically slap-
dash Bruce-Page poll in 1926, the electors
naturally refused to accept what they did
not understand. But Westralia was the
only State that cast affirmative majorities
at the Constitutional Alteration referendums
of 1910, 1911, 1913 and 1919. N. S. Wales
voted No on all four occasions; the re-
maining States, though all for the Federal-
ising of the State debts (as all ■ six were
when this issue was put in an extended
form in 1928), were Yes-No on the
other matters submitted. Westralia also
pronounced in 1916 and 1917 for national
sendee overseas, giving Hughes in each year
greater majorities (94,069 to, 40,884 in 1916,
84,116 to 46,522 in 1917) than Lincoln got
in 20 of the 25 “loyal” States which voted
at his second Presidential election, when the
issue was whether the war for the preserva-
tion of the Union should be carried to a
triumphant conclusion or abandoned, with
recognition of the rebel Confederacy.
It will be strange if a people with a
record like that shoidd surrender to a sel-
fish and sterile provincialism and declare
for separation from the “indissoluble” Com-
monwealth.

When Queensland Would Have Fallen
In.
“Macd” : “FY7” (B. 21/12/’32) deplores the
turning down of Thomas Mcllwraith’s pro-
posal to build a line from Charleville to Point
Parker, the most brazen scheme ever offered
to an unsuspecting public. How Thomas
Mcllwraith (whom I knew well) could ever
have hoped to foist such an impudent
swindle on the people is beyond my com-
prehension. The syndicate was to construct
a railway from Charleville to Point Parker,
of which Captain Pennefather’s report
stated: “To make the deep water anchorage
off Point Parker some nine or ten miles
of shallow water (two to three fathoms)
has to be traversed.” The syndicate was
to be granted 12,000,000 acres of land for
offering to construct, but not in payment
for constructing, a railway. If the syndicate
was dissatisfied with any part of the land
included in the blocks to be handed over,
it was to be at liberty to select an equal
area of other Crown lands in Queensland.
The syndicate, after construction of the
line, would consider an offer to purchase
the line, provided the original cost plus
15 per cent, were forthcoming. Such sale
was not, however, to affect the 12 million
acres of freehold already granted by the
State. The people of Queensland, gullible
then as now, were not such mugs as my old
friend Thomas had hoped they, would be,
and turned down his ridiculous offer with
ignominy. The incident is still of value
as showing how carefully these syndicate
schemes have to be considered. Especially
is it necessary to be sure you don’t have
to pay cash as well as make a huge land-
grant.
+
The Islands.
“Gad” (from Rossel Island, Papua): This
part of Papua is known as “The Islands.”
All sorts of islands' they are—big, small,
flat, mountainous, peopled, unpeopled; but
all alike in their sea-girt splendor.
You don’t need to be much of a linguist
to make known your wants in the islands.
Quite fortunately some unhonored genius,
realising that life was too short to get
acquainted with 267 different dialects, for
purposes of trading invented pidgin Eng-
lish. Pidgin is a combination of the lan-
guage we all spoke, more or less, in
childhood and something else which might
conveniently be called Desperanto. You im-
provise this latter part; and the rest just
grows upon you.
But if one could master a local dialect
I daresay one might be admitted into the
fuller intimacy of these people’s hearts and
minds. To a stranger they certainly look
if they were on the verge of letting you
into some great secret. They are the most
confiding-looking people I have ever seen in
life. But this front, which sometimes
assumes proportions of angelic benignance,
cannot be penetrated by pidgin.
At first sight the Papuan is apt to strike
one as rather easy in his ways. He knows
no form of salaam. Honorifically he speaks
of the white man as Taubada; but this,
with what one might call characteristically
Australian aplomb, he often contracts to
“Taub.” Still, the effect is pleasing, and
one feels it is probably uttered with a more
active sense of goodwill than many a
“ Salaam, Sahib.”
The most'exciting event that can’ happen
to the natives on this island is the appear-
ance of a ship-mast on the horizon. Then
the boys, one after another, and finally in
unison, chant “Sail-o.” It was for moments
such as these our forebears lived in expecta-
tion, long, long ago; and in like fashion, I
imagine, was the coming of Columbus sig-
nalled by the watchers on the American
coast. Even now no product of Western
civilisation can observe the spontaneous en-
thusiasm of such a scene without feeling
that maybe it is these people, the grand-
children of cannibals, who have guessed
the great secret. They know nothing of the
dole, the cost of living, the basic wage, the
Ottawa Conference or the gold standard.
They don’t care a snap of their fingers for
Mr. Lang, Mr. Stevens or Jock Garden.
The exchange could mount over the horizon
and fall in a heap the other side, the Bank
of England could iperge with Woolworth’s,
and Einstein could discover to-morrow that
the earth was flat, and the native Papuan
would remain unmoved. He would still go
on enjoying simple things in a simple and
spontaneous way.
I don’t know why people get an itch to
go to Russia to see the millennium in
being. Let them come to Papua instead.
Here even we Austral-Papuans are spared
the ' indignity of being forced to vote for
some entirely unworthy person to misrepre-
sent us in Parliament, and are exempt from
income tax. .

POLITICAL
POINTS
The year has opened with more cheerful
reports from most of the markets of the
world. Sydney wool prices reacted
promptly: there has been a rise of anything
from 5 to nearly 10 p.c., with Japan still
a strong buyer and Yorkshire less disposed
to hold off than it was before the holidays.
There is a better tone in the wheat markets
also. But the best that is looked for any-
where is a slow improvement, partly be-
cause of the world’s enormously increased
capacity for production. This is truer of
metals —copper especially—than of most
things. There was never a time when copper
could be supplied at such low costs.
If the League gets really stern with Japan
over the taking of Shanhaikwan and Japan
withdraws from the League, what will be
clone about the Carolines and Marshalls?The
League may withdraw the mandate, but
“Why do you kick him when he's down?"
“Purely in self-defence, honorable fellow-
member of the League. You see, he
might . get up!"
Japan may refuse to get out of the islands.
It may even decide that the clause prevent-
ing it from fortifying them is null and void.
The business of establishing world peace on
a basis of sentiment gets more and more
difficult.
Imports for November were the highest
for any month since 1930. The high ex-
change rate apparently isn’t effective any
longer. As always happens, the importer
paid the extra money to the exporter, and
then gradually put up his prices in order
to get it back again. Now a higher level
of prices has been established, so the ex-
change rate has ceased to be the old bar
to imports.
Forty-five nations are now “off” gold, and
it begins to look as though gold will have
to come back to sterling or thereabouts.
Some of the gold prices already look very
absurd. Lead, for instance, is £lO ss. ster-
ling, equal to £7 in gold. Nobody is think-
ing of lead on a £7-per-ton basis; the world
is thinking of it at £lO a ton —which sug-
gests that sterling has become the standard
rather than gold. It presents a very awk-
ward problem for Uncle Sam and France,
the two great gold-holders.
Harry Gullett, the Minister of Customs,
who* had a breakdown after Ottawa, returned
to Canberra last week and denied a report
that he was about to retire, saying “I fully
expect to be in charge of my department
again at the end of the month.” But the
journey from Jervis Bay knocked him out
so much that within two days he had in-
formed Lyons that he might have to leave
the Ministry, and would if a Melbourne
specialist gave him that advice. If he does,
Bruce is to be recalled from London. Gul-
lett is a journalist, and though a good many
journalists aspire to be politicians, few find
the life congenial. They don’t stand the
strain nearly so well as farmers, for example.
Nor do they cut much ice as a rule, except
in the domain of destructive criticism.
Gullett gave promise of being an exception.
Not only tourists but pensioners from
overseas have to pay unemployed-relief tax
in N. S. Wales. The case of a retired R.N.
officer is mentioned; from his pension of £250
p.a. the British income-tax office takes 2s.
6d. in the £ on £100; then the 'N-'.S.W. Gov-
ernment exacts Is. in the £ on £250. And
unless a mighty change has been effected
since Lang’s time, quite £2 10s. of the £l2
10s. will go to impostors. In other
days, Sydney, the Blue Mountains and the
South .Coast had great attractions for tour-
ists and pensioners from other parts, but
the politicians are driving them away.
Colac (Vic.) General Hospital is to be
turned into a community establishment on
the American plan. Additions are to be
made with the help of a Government loan
of £35,000; there is room how for 06
patients, and accommodation is to be pro-
vided for 40 more in intermediate and
private sections. So that the place may be
a real medical centre local meds. will aban-
don their consulting-rooms, and private hos-
pitals now in existence will be abolished.
Premier Argyle, himself a medical man, is
a strong believer in the community system.
South Aus. may be the first State to out-
law pre-selection. Pour party organisations
are preparing for the general election, and
all are going in for the old swindle in some
daring form or other. Sixteen more or less
obscure persons in the Midland division of
the Leg. Council, which has over 15,000
electors, refused ex-Minister Pascoe the
right to stand again as Liberal candidate,
though he has been member for 33 years.
Things almost as impudent have been done
by alleged Liberals in other electorates, and
A.L.P. ballots have produced the familiar
charges of “irregularities.” On the word
of the “Worker” correspondent Very few
Laborites voted in these ballots ; though they
are all two- and three-member electorates,
“a hundred is a good muster.” Apparently
less than 1 p.c. of the electors (340,000
altogether) will decide on the candidates
who are to be thrust on the other 99-odd
p.c. with party brands. South Aus. is a
State with good democratic traditions, and
this monstrous development of machine poli-
tics will not bo taken lying down.
Already annoyed at the reintroduction
of Fiji bananas, Queensland is strongly
objecting to the proposed Federal levy for
the inspection of apples and pears, the
object being to finance State and Federal
fruit-marketing organisations and scientific
research. Bananalartd lias had a fruit-
marketing organisation for years, and has
also devoted a good deal of money to scien-
tific work in the orchard and the laboratory.
'Flic Federal notion may be all right for
some of the States, but in the case of
Queensland it amounts to unnecessary dupli-
cation of charges and supervision.
There is to be a metropolitan conference
of the Lang faction shortly, and the busi-
ness paper is significantly barren of expres-
sions of enthusiasm for the Lang plan. In
fact, the only reference to the exploded thing
is hostile: the Reid electorate council pro-
poses that “the plan known as the Lang
plan, being merely a reformist policy con-
ceived and intended to prop up the decay-
ing capitalist system, be no longer recog-
nised or ‘propagandised’ as the policy plan
of the A.L.P.” This has an ominous ring,
especially as Reid is the Federal electorate
for which Lang put up his friend Gander
as a seat-warmer; and more ominous still is
“Heavens, that isn’t my shadow!”
the suggestion that A. C. Willis would be
a more congenial chief to the socialisation
group than Lang. Before he went to Lon-
don as Agent-General Willis was leader of
the Langsters in the Leg. Council and man-
ager of Lang’s newspaper. He has been
very silent since his return —when he found
both posts securely held, and nothing else
in sight—but he is expected to start bark-
ing at any moment.
The Irish Free State is to have another
general election, the second in 11 months.
De Valera has had to reckon with the pos-
sible withdrawal of Labor support owing to
reduction of salaries, particularly in the
post office; moreover, Cosgrave’s men
(Curnann na nGaedlieal) and the Farmers’
group have been discussing the formation of
a national pro-Treaty party, while the
effects of the Government’s anti-British
policy, though serious, are not yet disastrous,
having been tempered by the seizure of the
land annuities. So the sudden dissolution
of the Dail is regarded as a shrewd move;
at all events it has forced the Labor group
to declare itself pro-Government still. After
the February election, Fianna Fail (De
Valera’s party) had 73 members and Curnann
na nGaedheal 56, while there were seven
Laborites, four Farmers and 13 Independ-
ents. The Free State has gone in for pro-
portional representation, which makes even
small majorities difficult to overturn.
Notwithstanding the dole given to dis-
tressed wheat-farmers and a trifling cut in
taxation, the Federal Treasury is looking
forward to a surplus of 31 millions. Most
of it will come from Customs; imports have
“Representatives of the Federal Ministry will be
able to inform the Loan Council that the finances
are in a particularly healthy condition.”
LYONS (to Stevens): “My, doesn’t he look
well—the insect, of course, I mean!”
lately been pouring in. For these figures
the Government seems to think it deserves
a whole anthem of cheers. It would far
better deserve them if it had so cut taxes
that it had to fight desperately to make ends
meet. Surpluses derived from hard economy
are good things; surpluses derived from
excessive taxes merely tempt weak Govern-
ments to extravagance.
Queensland out-of-works are joining the
railwaymen in giving their “class-conscious”
Government hark from the tomb. The un-
employed at Charleville got together the
other day and decided that they were “liv-
ing in a state of semi-starvation” on “fifteen
bob one week and six bob the next.” Still,
they were not too far gone to pass several
more resolutions. In one they recorded “with
disgust” that “tlie Queensland. Labor Gov-
ernment” had “refused to issue double
rations for Christmas,” although “the enemy
of the working class, the Stevens Govern-
ment of N.5.W.,” had come to light with
the double issue.
Since the Forgan Smiths restored prefer-
ence to unionists, including the female of
the species, the membership of the Queens-
land Clerks’ Union has gone up from 2200
to 5000. The union bosses were immensely
gratified when they counted heads, but there
is. a fly in the ointment: the new members
are trying to get control of the organisa-
tibn. In N. S. Wales a Clerks’ Union ticket
has often been, a passport to politics. Lang
found it convenient to become an organised
clerk, and so have 'a number of ambitious
lawyers, one of whom has since mounted the
Bench.
Calvin Coolidge, who has died suddenly
at 60, was the luckiest of the 31 Presidents.
Named Vice-President in 1921, he succeeded
the ill-fated Harding in 1923, and was re-
elected two years later by a sweeping major-
ity. The years he spent in the White
House were all boom years, and he left
before the slump which was to harry the
next tenant, and overwhelm him at last.
Coolidge got a great, and probably unde-
served, reputation for statesmanship by
keeping his mouth shut. Taciturn by
nature, he was taken for one of those strong,
silent men whom people set up as idols
when they have grown weary or distrustful
of talkers. And he did not shatter the illu-
sion, as the late Bill Lambert did in these
parts. Bill loomed up as a sort of local
Coolidge in 1920 or thereabouts. Saying-
little, and showing an inscrutable face to
the world, he became president of the
A.L.P., Lud Mayor and M.H.R. for West
Sydney and was spoken of as a future Prime
Minister. But Bill lost his head and started
to make speeches; and that was the end
of him. .
There is a sort of wild irony about inter-
national relations, even when nations are
mouthing platitudes about peace, but foi
sheer low comedy an incident of the fighting
around Shanghai would be hard to beat.
While Japanese warships were bombarding
Chapei, a 3000-ton destroyer flying the flag
of Nippon steamed up the Whangpoo.
When she had got to her anchorage the
Japanese flag was replaced with the flag ot
the Republic. She was the Ninghai, built
to China’s orders in a Japanese yard for
half a million. If her first act had been to
fire a Japanese shell out of a Japanese gun
at the Japanese squadron and kill a few
dozen Japanese sailors it would have been
all in accord with the Business as Usual
principle on which international relations
are founded.
The skilful pilot of the ’plane which
crashed 200 miles north of Forrest (W.A.)
has brought back the goldseeker who had to
be left behind. Two R.A.A.F. machines
were requisitioned to keep him supplied
with food and water, and to help in other
ways. This job cost £lOOO or more, exclus-
ive of salaries and depreciation,, and pre-
sumably the £lOOO or more will have to be
added to the other bad debts incurred in
the search for “Lasseter’s lost reef, ’ wlncn
has been a tragi-comedy of crashing ’planes
and missing goldseekers. While 6 marooned
in the desert,” 'as the daily papers put it,
the well-advertised Whelan, though “suffer-
ing from an injured hip,” found a waterhole
with eight natives about it, and the remains
of a prospector’s camp dating back to 1900
or thereabouts. The fact is that droves ot
Westralian prospectors have crossed and re-
crossed this “desert” and returned without
as much as a specimen. And if anyone like
Lasseter had turned up at Ivalgoorlie m
1900 with a tale that he had found a 3oz.
reef, 10ft. wide and 12 miles long, lie would
have found politicians and journalists a lot
more sceptical than Canberra members of
one profession and Big-City ornaments o.
the other have shown themselves since.
The Lang “plan” is so very dead that
Lang’s newspaper has forgotten what it was.
“South Africa Now Adopts the Lang Plan’
was the “Labor Daily” headline over the news
that Hertzog’s country had gone off gold.
Australia did that many months before Lang
(or Sleemanj produced his “plan”; and the
S’African Government is not, proposing to
“scale” its creditors or talking rubbish about
a goods standard. Again, going off gold was
the policy of the “Tory” Smuts. It was
opposed for months, and adopted reluctantly
in the end, by Hertzog and his Labor allies.
“The N.S.W. Milk Board has assumed full control
of the milk supply in the Newcastle area; it
already had control in the metropolitan area. The
minimum price payable by distributors to dairymen
is Hid. per gallon; maximum retail price chargeable
by distributors is 28. 2d. per gallon."
STRAWRERRY: “I get elevenpence; you pay
two-and-two. I dunno which is the
poor cow —you or me.”
With so many of his election-time sup-
porters railing at Forgan {Smith it was not
to be expected that the clerks in the Gov-
ernment departments would remain silent.
When his Arbitration Act opened the door
of the. Industrial Court to them Foggy
fondly imagined that they would be satisfied.
But the State Service Union has discovered
that tlie measure says nothing about cancel-
ling those provisions of the 1931 Financial
Emergency Act which reduced salaries. As
tlie union paper puts it, “Those who be-
lieved that the promise of the return of
access to the Industrial Court meant the
restoration of the old award were deceived.”
If there is any more of this an enraged
Premier may a'dyise the service to cut out
its old motto and substitute “Gimme,
Gimme.” *

“Kerys”: My neighbor, although she is

resist giving the man who brought the big

had wanted the same kind of fern as that
stuck-up Mrs. Blank, a few doors away, had
in the big green pot beside her steps, and
further announced her intention of getting
a similar pot when funds permitted. Then
she planted the fern in a camouflaged kero-

to find a large green pot alongside' plus a
note from Mrs. Blank, saying that as she
had the fern she might as well have the pot,
Mrs. Blank having no further use for it.

age the whole shooting match behind the

East Indies port, the sheik stumbles on a
copy of The Bulletin ; and now I think
I’ll turn on W. Somerset:—
There was a London letter, and a certain amount
of calbled information from Europe, and America.
There was a good deal of local intelligence. He
turned to the police news.... There had been a
burglary at Newcastle. Some man had received a
sentence for an insurance fraud. A stabbing affray
between two Tonga islanders was reported.... There
were two columas about a murder that had taken
place at a farmstead in the Blue Mountains....
There was the report of an inquest on a woman
who had hanged herself... .

“Wobey” : Let me add my tribute to the
versatility of the police (B. 21/32/’32).
The local constable was instructed by some-
one higher up to attend our church' bazaar.
He reported: “The proceedings were orderly.
I saw no gambling and heard no complaints.
A few raffles took place for hams and other
works of art.”

“Tbn el Issar”; A thing that wearies me
in these attempts to boom more or less
imaginary goldfields is the continual reference
to them as “Golcondas.” Golconda is an
ancient fortress city in the Indian State of
Hyderabad. It never was a goldfield; its
inhabitants made a more or less honest living
by cutting and: polishing diamonds mined at
Partial, another district of Hyderabad.
Many of the finest stones India has produced
came from the Partial field, and, since these
were cut and marketed by the Golconda
dealers, the outside wprld invented the phrase
“the wealth of Golconda.”

“Mclls”: We scoff at some of the ill-

Australia was drawing perilously near to its tail,

Too much credit cannot be given to Bradman;
he overcame a series of obstacles that might well
have daunted Nero.
As far as can be learned from history, Nero’s
principal achievement was burning down
Borne and charging the crime to the Chris-
tians. And when things began to go against
him he wept bitterly and cut his throat.

evidence when a man said that he had failed
to turn up on a job because he had been

paper parcel out of his pocket, opened it
and exhibited half a thumb with two typical
punctures on it. He had chopped the mem-
ber off with his own axe!

“Irish Moss”: The unlucky prospector
Patrick Whelan, who has been making his-
tory of a sort, isn’t the first of his name to
be associated with goldfields pioneering. A
previous Patrick Whelan flourished for 20
.years and more in the piping days of Kal-
goorlie, and the town had no better-known
citizen. But the resemblance ends with the
names. The pioneering of the original I’.W.
was confined to breweries and hotels, and
no man ever looked the part better. He was
a stout :<*-d jovial Irishman, full of sociable
stories and what the Americans call wise-
cracks. In his spare time he was a Jay Pay,
a distinction on which he set great store, and
he liked nothing better than officiating as
coroner. Naturally, too, he was a
fervent patriot, who hoped to live long enough
to see Ireland’s Parliament re-established on
College Green, although Fate denied him
that. But he never let politics interfere
with bar trade, and he was a kindly soul,
held in general regard. The prevalence of
Irish names among Westralian prospectors
has often beeii noted, and it was hardly
less marked among the publicans. But

immemorial, and the Lord Provost of Glas-
gow and the Lord Mayor of Belfast, upon

times by special grant. What the’ twenty

“S.V.” : The latest Bradman yarn comes
from the Speck. A man was listening to the
broadcast of the Melbourne Test match at
a pub. He became so disgusted, at the Bowral
boy’s dismissal for a duck in the first inn-
ings that he rushed out into the open air
and wended his way towards the river to
solace his wounded soul in the contem-
plation of Nature. As he approached the
stream he saw three children overbalance
and fall in. He dived in with all his clothes
on and rescued the lot. On second thoughts,
I don’t know that it ought to be called a
Bradman yarn. The, long Yorkshireman
Bowes, who got Bradman first ball, seems
to have been a more efficacious instrument
of Providence in the saving of three young
lives.

“Aileron”: Jules Verne made a very sue-
cessful forecast of the submarine in “Twenty
Thousand Leagues Under the Sea ” The
aeroplane was prefigured by £>me forgotten
genius fn a printed handkerchief of the kind
that used to be familiar to many of us in our
childhood. A feature of the thing is a large
drawing of a contrivance which in most re-
spects resembles the ’plane of to-day the
method used for staying the wings being
almost identical. The machine has an en-
closed, windowed passenger-cabin with land-
ing wheels and tail and rudder. It is
steam-driven, with twin screws propelling
it from the rear after the fashion of
the Wrielit and Farman ’nlnnes The
hanky bears the title “Flying Steam Com- -
pany to China in 24 Hours Certain,” and
the lower section shows an astonished
Chinese emperor and his court eyeing , the
advancing ’plane, from which passengers are
dropping witli parachutes. The handkerchief
is 100 vears old

Lao-dah : Reported that the Japs are
having tiouplo in iNXanchukuo through the
Chinese sniping at them from the millet
crops. Millet, like sugar, grows to an lm-
mense height, transforming the landscape
and burying the villages in an ocean of
green. _ There are hundreds of square miles
of it m Manchuria, and it would certainly
create a military m blem of the first order,
the Dutch in Java, have trouble enough
with sugar, even in the piping times of
peace. When a native is hard up he
leases his ricefield to a sugar co., and when
he has spent the money and the foreigner’s
crop hasn’t .been harvested, he gets an-
noyed. He makes a bomb by scooping out
a cocoanut and filling it with oil. Then
he attaches a fibre fuse, creeps into the
middle, of his property, sets his bomb and
retires home to bed. The resultant blaze
is reported by the nearest guardhouse sentry
sleepily banging his wooden gong. The next
sentry takes up the note, and the alarm may
spread from one end of the island to the other,
The problem then is to find out who first
gave the information. The nearest villagers
are supposed to turn out to extinguish the
conflagration, but when native resentment
runs high the Government has to rely on a
flying patrol of its own,

“Balham” : The uniformity of speech be-
tween G.P.S., High School and State-school
pupils, remarked by “Whitehall' (B.
4/l/’33), may apply to boys, but the girls'
public and secondary schools pay a good deal
of attention to spoken English, and some
very beautiful young voices may be heard
on the amateur stage and over the air. There
is nothing more lovely than a girls’ school
singing its school song, with ah’s carefully
broadened and a’s and i’s neatly clipped. By
the way, wireless is disclosing in a shatter-
ing manner the Orstrylianisation of Aus-
tralian English. Especially do the bells of
old Bow ring through the speech of the
younger clergy, quite replacing the once-
characteristic “parson’s bleat”—rather for
ike worse. And I heard the other day over
the air a New Guard rally. Came first in
standard English introductory remarks by
an evidently English Guardsman: then foi-
lowed the Big Chief himself, making ponti-
fical utterance in the fruity vowelling of
Cockaigne.

A century’s crowded third has come and
gone
Since we decided to become a nation.
Come on, New Year, come on !
I always bank on .lucky numbers—Heaven
Alone may tell the wherefore; and the why.
The fact that you’re a quotient of eleven
Secures from me an optimistic eye.
It dates perhaps from when I heard a

Uncle of six-and-sixty: summers state y,
To seventy-seven he felt sure of going.

On with your pads and gloves, my blithe
newcomer!
Stride to the crease with courage firm
and hot!
The world was seldom drearier or. glummer,
Your obvious mission is to stop the rot.
Your predecessors marched in sad proces-

Pavilion-wards, their tallies mostly nix.
Come, see if you can’t clump Old Man

Over the rails for six!
In lives of men and eke of women, eertes

There’s solid resolution in the thirties;
It’s then the things worth-while are mostly

Can’t last for ever, that I’ll guarantee.
Now, mind, we look to you to paste the

T. THE R.


“Tabary”: The inebriate who was most
lightly dealt with for Christmastime excess
was undoubtedly the sacrilegious person who
broke into a Sydney church and collected
some of the plate for removal. At this point,
fortunately for the sacred edifice 8 his eye
fell on two or three bottles of communion
wine, and he yielded to another sort of
temptation. The verger found him there
next morning, dead to the world, with his
unlifted spoil lying around him. Instead
of handing the malefactor over to the law,
however, the verger, moved by Christ-
mas impulses, let him go, justifying his
action on the ground that nothing had been
taken except the wine, and possibly only
sufficient of that to contribute to the rob-
ber’s collapse. Such, at all events, was the
story as it appeared in the Sydney dailies.
I have an idea that the robber was a re-

incarnation of Francois Villon; there seems
something essentially Villonesque about the
business. In the Middle Ages, however,
boiling in oil would have been a very light
punishment for an offence of that sort.
:{: :Ji #
“Guff” : American methods of salesmanship
are frequently carried to lengths that would
repel rather than attract in British communi-
ties. The latest is “selling it with scent.” All
sorts of articles for office and general use are
perfumed. Even motor-cars are sprayed with
the odors of Araby. That sort of thing may
go down with the American, but it would
certainly disgust the average Briton, at home
or abroad, who is apt to look on highly-
scented goods or individuals with much the
same aversion as that shown by the old
huntsman towards “them stinkin’ wiolets”
which put an end to fox-hunting every spring.
“Yavutu”: The yoke of the missionary
sits lightly on the converted heathen if his
mentor should depart. According to Pastor
Palmer, who returned to Sydney recently after
years of work in Fiji, the Christian natives
in the wild mountain hinterland are show-
ing signs of slipping back to the faith of
their fathers, and are again coming under
the control of the witch-doctors. The moun-
tain natives are a very different people from
their salt-water brethren, with whom tourists
are familiar. They .see little of the white
man. For years a story lingered among
the unregenerate that the reason for their
conversion in the beginning was a pair of
boots. These were worn by an evangelist
named Baker who ventured among the un-
sophisticated savages. When they came
to eat him they regarded his boots as part
of his anatomy and devoured those too.
After they recovered it was agreed that
a people who could work magic like that
which nearly laid out an entire village com-
manded respect, and conversion to Chris-
tianity followed.

“Der Jong”: That yarn about Methuen
ignoring a Boer officer on parade in Malta,
because the Afrikander said he was the man
who had taken Methuen prisoner at Twee-
bosch in the Western Transvaal (B. 4/l/’33),
doesn’t ring true. There wasn’t an ounce of
that spirit in Methuen’s make-up. In any
case, there was nothing for him to be
ashamed of in his capture by the Boers.
He was so badly wounded that Delarey sent
him in under a flag of truce to get medical
attention which he himself could not pro-
vide.
* * * *
“Pincher”: The P. and O. reports that
the picnic voyage of the Strathaird to Nor-
folk Island resulted in heavy casualties
among silver teaspoons and other table acces-
sories. Still, it might have been worse. When
the first American fleet visited Port Jackson
visitors with the souveniring habit got away
with practically everything except the big
guns, the loot ranging from unscrewed door
handles to the flagship’s silver punch bowl.
This last, however, was recovered, probably
owing to the danger that would have attended
any attempt to turn it into cash.
* * * *
“Centurion”: At least one section of the
British Army wore beards by compulsion
(B. 4/l/’33) up' to the comparatively
recent times when they were themselves
abolished. These were the pioneers, who
were attached to every infantry regiment,
marching at the very head thereof, even in
front of the Colonel. They were supposed
to clear the way for the regiment behind
them and performed other manual fatigues
of the kind. For this purpose they carried
axes, saws, billhooks and other implements
of their profession and wore leather aprons.
I don’t know how they shaped on active
service, but I still have a recollection of
them on parade and ceremonial marches in
such garrison towns as York. Each man
possessed a ziff which would have afforded
nesting facilities to a dozen birds. Their
aprons, stretching from neck to knee, were
of buckskin, pipeclayed to a dazzling white.
The axes, picks, spades, etc., were either
nickeled or polished with elbow grease to
the brightness of silver. I fancy in those
days I would rather have been a pioneer-
sergeant than a drum-major.

“Beaudesert”: The female of the species
is seldom a furious motor-driver, but an
exception crops
up occasionally.
The other night
a car went over
a toll bridge be-
tween Brisbane
and Southport
(Q.) as the Devil
went through
Athlone, nearly
obliterating the
scared toll-collec-
tor —who didn’t
collect on this
occasion. It was
pursued by two
traffic cops on
motor-cycles, but
the lady driver
only stepped on
it the harder.
Putting on a
spurt, one of the
constables got in
front of the car,
and, after a flight
through the air,
found himself
clinging to its
bonnet. His mate
fired a couple of
shots,, through the
back tyres, and
the occupants of
the car surrend-
ered. It was a
singed and very
irate bobby who
disentangled him-
self from the red-
hot bonnet, but
it says something
for the chivalry
of the pair that
they contented
themselves with
taking the
driver’s name.

“Binns”: There was a demonstration in
Dublin against the employment of an Eng-
lish hangman for a professional job. Ketch
appears to have carried out his part of the
contract with neatness and dispatch; the
objection was simply to good Irish money
going to the Sassenach even for adjusting
a noose and pulling a lever. Yet, if the
official hangman’s trade is about the lowest
and vilest conceivable, as the tradition of the
last century or so insists, there seems to be
hardly material for complaint in the employ-
ment of an outlander —at a pinch or other-
wise. When the Russian Revolution of the
late war years got fairly into its stride the
executioners were requisitioned from China,
and probably not altogether because of their
superior skill and experience.
* * * *
“Jungor”: Hoover has fallen, but details
of his early life still have their jour-
nalistic value. A “Saturday Evening
Post” man cites as a proof of the
high reputation the young man earned
as an engineer that he was “selected
to take charge of a goldmine at Leonora,
West Australia, where the water difficulty
was acute and the temperature sometimes
rises to 110 degrees.” The mine, of course,
was the Sons of Gwalia, one of the pro-
positions that Bewick, Moreing and Co.,
Hoover’s employers, controlled, ai>d one that
is still a producer. But I don’t think
Hoover’s management was more than a
stopgap one (for a few months in 1897),
and vVestralia has hotter places than
Leonora. There are a few people left in
W.A. who still have dim recollections of
the American who was to climb to the White
Hou.se, but I doubt if he made any more
impression than the generality of 8., M. and
Co.’s young men, whom one might meet any-

where between Coolgardie and Cue, mostly
full of hustle and importance and carrying
attache cases which were vaguely supposed
to be bursting with office secrets and assays.
The thing that seems to be best remembered
about Hoover is that he was always a tee-
totaller.
* * * *
“Hamer”: Temperance reformers find a
bright spot in the hard times in the decreased
consumption of hard drinks. Certainly, com-
pared with 1929-30, the beer consumption in
N.S.W. for 1931-32 (14,967,121 gallons)
fell by 81 million gallons, and the spirits
consumption (617,705 gallons) by 378.000
gallons. But the trouble is that cheap wine
of the vilest sort and even more pernicious
substitutes have largely taken the place of
wholesome stimulants, and there are no avail-
able statistics under this head. Nor are
there any about the increase in home-
brew r ed beer, which has also established
a vogue of its own. At a place
where materials for making your own beer
are purchaseable I had to wait three-
quarters of an hour to be served. Police-court
convictions for drunkenness don’t mean much.
The man who drinks illicit brews or “plonk”
(otherwise known as “madman soup”) by
the quart does it in quiet spots or at home.
* :!-. *
“Barangkali” : The telephone hoaxer was
never more frequent in Sydney than in 1932.
Thousands of calls for the Zoo, the Dogs’
Home and the Morgue on April 1 harassed
the attendants, even if they brought in
extra revenue for the department. Sydney
Fire Brigade, however, was the worst suf-
ferer ; there were hundreds of bogus calls
during the 12 months, and every turnout
costs at least £3. Another telephonic _ nuis-
ance used the names of well-known residents
and ordered various firms to send their goods
to a certain address. Besides tradesmen, fire
brigades, doctors, nurses, ambulances, under-
takers and ministers were all victimised,
and the culprit was never discovered. He
indulged in his peculiar form of humor on
three separate occasions before tiring of it.

“Fumerole”: As to cigarettes in England
(B. 14/12/’32), it has been chronicled in
a biography that “Ouida” was a pioneer
of the fashion among women in the 1860’s.
The writer states that he was invited _to
one of the parties she was fond of giving
at the Langham Hotel. At the foot of the
invitation was Causeries intimes; cigarettes
permises. When he arrived he found the
company, mostly the mid-Victorian equiva-
lent of our flappers, in full blast, the
room being so full of smoke that he, a non-
smoker, soon had to beat a retreat with the
best grace he could muster.
* * * *
“Cap’n Flint”: The assassination in San
Francisco harbor of a modern edition of
Bully Hayes demands attention, if only by
reason of the name he travelled under.
Originally a Pole named Pieczynski, he found
the name rather a handicap in his buccan-
eering business and appropriately changed
it to Will Wanderwell. Which reminds me
that in pre-war days, before the Sydney
afternoon press had made Darlinghurst the
G.H.Q. of the underworld, someone ran a
bootmaker’s shop at the top of William-
street under the name of “Will Wearwell.”
Just for good measure, on the other side of
the street he had a hairdresser’s establish-
ment, the signboard of which said it was run
by “Wilfred Wigzell.” I never met him in
the flesh or learned his identity, but to me
ho has always ranked with the Man in the
1 roe Mask and the Individual Who Assaulted
Buckley.
“Pom”: Sydney may shortly see an un-
usual memorial. Seventy years ago there
dwelt in the then isolated hamlet of East-
wood now a flourishing suburb of Sydney,
an old lady named Smith, who, with her two
sons, eked out a living by cultivating a
little orchard. One day the old lady noted
that a self-planted seedling apple looked
promising. It was
carefully tended
an d developed
and became the
original sourcfe of
the “G ran n y
Smith” apple,
admittedly one of
the world’s best.
N.S.W. orchard-
ists are being
organised to pro-
vide some form
of memorial for
the old lady, the
Department of
Agriculture spon-
soring the move-
ment.

“Verri”: One
of the minor tra-
gedics of the
gold-selling mania
that has smitten
Sydney is the re-
velation of the
• perfidy of many
donors of testi-
monials to _ de-
serving citizens.
Recently a man
suffering from de-
presli decided re-
luctantly to part
with his presen-
tation watch, be-
stowed on him
when he was a
well-known wel-
fare worker in a
big suburb. He
was offered £2
for the timepiece,
and assured that
never at any time
was it worth
more than £4. As
to his knowledge
over £2O was col-
lected and sup-
posedly devoted
to the purchase
of the gift, he is
wondering what
became of the
balance. In an-
other case the
chain of a pre;
sentation watch was assessed at five shillings,
and pronounced gold-wash over silver. All
sorts of baubles hoarded for years as valu-
ables are to-day failing to pass the acid test,
and the gold cup and silver salver are under
suspicion everywhere,

■ Few regard N.S.W. as a
diamond-producing country, but on the
authority of diamond-expert Jules Joris the
State’s output for the past seven years
is valued at £40,000. Only five per
cent, of these diamonds can be cut for
gem stones, the rest being used for various
industrial purposes. It is worth noting, in
view of the tremendous congestion existing
in South Africa and the closing of the Kim-
berley and the Premier mines, on top of the
Government ban on diamond-mining in
Namaqualand, that prices for gem stones
have gone up 40 per cent, since August.

“Cato” : The moustache is apparently to
return to favor in England since the King,
as Colonel-in-Chief of the Household
Cavalry, intimated a wish that all officers
of his regiments should cultivate what Kip-
ling calls lip-thatches. It is not altogether
clear why George R., nattily bearded in the
naval tradition ever since lie reached man-
hood, should wish to see a faded military
fashion re-established, but the fiat has gone
forth, and officers of the Guards regiments
will doubtless seek to loyally carry out the
sovereign’s will. One features a new type
of subaltern accordingly, like the warrior
who once adorned the covers of “Booties’

with the possible exception of the Church,

“A request for a pyjama parade to be staged 1 by
women at tbe Manly Lifesavers’ annual carnival has
been disallowed by the authorities.”
There’ll be stunts by the score to applaud
and encore
With the usual eclat and emotion,
As the lifesavers urge their craft through

For feats on the verge of the ocean.
There’ll be carnival high to enrapture the
eye
With glowing and rich panoramas,
But a ban has been laid on a beauty parade
Of girls in alluring pyjamas.
That’s that!
The line has been drawn at pyjamas.
Though what beach law requires in our
mermaids’ attires
Grows less with each shimmering season,
Where the se a and the sands are the stage
and the stands,
The boldest must listen to reason.
They may bask in the boom of the backless
costume
Till their bronze is suggestive of Brahmas;
They may sunbake by stacks in their shorts
and their slacks,
But they mustn’t parade in pyjamas.
No, no !
They’re over the odds in pyjamas.
There’ll be sports on the shore and attrac-
tions galore,
The sort that no wowser impeaches ;
The blue of the sky will blend from on high
With the glitter and gold of the beaches.
There’ll be contests to stage and races to
wage,
And the usual carnival dramas,
But you’ll see no brigade of damsels parade
In chic and becoming pyjamas.
Not much!
There’s a ban on parades in pyjamas.

Calvin Coolidge’s death at 60 leaves the
U.S. without an ex-President in being. Of
the last half-dozen occupants of the White
House only Taft (72) has lived to pass the
Psalmist’s span. Woodrow Wilson reached
67. but he was a hopeless invalid for years
before his death. McKinley was assassinated
at 58; Theodore Roosevelt passed out at
60; Harding died in harness at 57, Time
was when longevity was a marked charac-
teristic of American Presidents; the first
half-dozen averaged just on 80 years, with
John Adams (90) holding pride of place.
But the office was less exciting then.
“Fernkloof” on the census of V.C.’s: —
Estimators differ in regard to the number of Aus-
tralians who won the V.C. (B. 14/12/’32). Some
include Diggers born outside Australia, others ex-
clude them. Three Australians gained the distinc-
tion while serving elsewhere than in the A.I.P.
(Hawker, of the R.F.0.; Dartnell, of the City of
London Regiment; Mayrnan, of General Botha’s
East African Forces). How are these to be reckoned?
Although Australian soldiers, they were not Diggers
(of the A.1.F.). It has been claimed that Neville
Howse was the first Australian to win the V.C.--
in the S’African War. But Private Whirlpool, of
Kew (Vic.) Rifles, gained the Cross in the Indian
Mutiny in 1861; and hardly any of the lists include
him. The Bulletin of the date mentioned made
the total 69. It seems to be possible to make it
at least 71,
It fell to Acting-Gov. Irvine (Vic.) to
notify Senator Harry Lawson that he had
been made a K.C.M.G., which recalls that it
was Lawson who, when Premier, appointed
Irvine C.J., and had him made Lieut.-Gov:
in 1918. Harry was in Vic. Assembly 14
years before he got a sniff of office; then
Watt lifted him into the Lands chair, and
for the ne.xt 10 years he was only four
months out of Cabinet.
The oldest guest among the pioneers on
this last Commemoration Day at Glenelg
(S.A.) was William Clayton, who, although
100 years old, ate a hearty meal, and gave
a graphic description of his" arrival in South.
Aus. He told a Bulletin man that he was
the officer who admitted Adam Lindsay
Gordon to the Oddfellows; he remembers
that when he asked Lindsay what his occu-
pation was he replied “Boundary rider and
horse-breaker.”
Alexander Gray, of Wellington (M.L.),
who received a knighthood as his New Year’s
gift has been in practice as a barrister for
well over half a century. He took silk in
1912, and was president of the Law
Society in 1926. Two years later he was
made chairman of the Legal Conference.
ALEXANDER GRAY, K.C., new
Maoriland knight.
Among his public services, he-presided over
a Royal Commission on Auckland Hospital
a few years ago. A sound family and com-
mercial lawyer, Gray in late years has
appeared mostly in civil actions. He served
his articles with the old Wellington firm of
Izard and Bell.
The new Moderator of N.S.W. Presbyterian
Assembly, Rev. G. D. Brandt, one of whose
first jobs will be to preside at the Assembly’s
discussion of the Professor Angus dispute,
himself shocked the orthodox a few years
ago when he pronounced two-up the tauest
of all games of chance, his opinion having
been formed after unofficial visits to a few
“schools.” Brandt is a cleric who likes un-
clerical attire, because it enables linn to
move more freely amongst the people. But
there are few in Surry Hills who don t
know him now. He has been 17 years in
charge of the Chalmers-stroet church, which
became known as “the Repat. church” during
the busy days of the Repat. Dept. Brandt
gave himself an extra job as adviser to the
Diggers.
Norbert Keenan, K.C., M.L.A., who has
just refused the chance of being Westralia’s
next Agent-Gen-
eral, was born in
Dublin over 60
years ago and has
practised in his
adopted land
since the early
goldfields days.
He entered the
Assembly as
M.L.A. for Kal-
goorlie in 1905,
dropped out after
two terms and
didn’t return un-
til last general
elections—he sits
for the Swan-side
suburb of Ned-
lands nowadays.
Keenan has been
in tw r o Ministries
and left both
rather precipi-
tately after dis-
agreements with
h i s colleagues,
being a man who
likes his own
way and having
never been de-
pendent on poli-
tics for a living.
Jimmy Mitchell
was the last
leader with
.whom he quar-
relled, so that it
may be regarded
as • rather gener-
ous of Jimmy to
have offered him
the London job.
On the other
hand, Mitchell,

Beauchamp’s son, now

who has to face
the country in a few months, might have
reckoned it was good policy to get Keenan
out of the way.
Roland Wilson, just appointed to the
newly-created post of Economist in the
Statistician’s department at 'Canberra, is
still on the right side of 30. Seven years ago
he won a Tas. Rhodes scholarship; after
taking his Oxford degrees he went on to
Chicago University and picked up some more
degrees. Returning to the Speck, Wilson was
appointed lecturer in Economics at the local
Uni.
Dr. Wilton Love, dead in Brisbane at 71,
arrived as a child from Ulster, where his
father was a country parson. From Bris-
bane Grammar School he went to Edinburgh
University, graduating in medicine and sur-
gery in 1884; he came back to Queensland
two years later, only to return to Edin-
burgh, where for 10 years he was house
surgeon at the Royal Infirmary. Returning
to Queensland, lie sooii gained a foremost
place in his profession, becoming president
of the Queensland Medical Society and sur-
geon to several of Brisbane’s hospitals, while
for many years he was a member of tbc
Senate of Queensland University. His
friends were legion.
Another S. Aus. pastoralist has gone, at
61: W. D. Crozier. of a famous pioneer
family. Educated in Adelaide, he started
a merino stud early; and on the death (Jf
his father in 1909, bought in Moorna station
(N.S.W.), his birthplace. Selling it eventu-
ally to Ben Chaffey, he settled finally at
Markaranka, near the nor’-west bend of the
Murray in S. Aus. He was a fine judge of
all livestock, and at one time owned some
good racehorses.
W. R. Dovey, who was brought to Aus-
tralia over 40 years ago as actuary of the
Citizens, afterwards the M.L.C.. and who
later formed the Assurance and Thrift Asso-
ciation, died in Sydney at the week-end, aged
78. Mr. Dovey, trained in Edinburgh, was
one of the conservative school of insurance
men, who regarded their business as part
of their religion. Apart from his work in
insurance he took great interest in the
Society for the Visitation of the Sick, which
he also founded; and it was a great sorrow
to him that in his late years, through in-
creasing deafness, he was not able to carry
it on personally.
Pachmann, the queer old man who would
leave off in the middle of playing his beloved
Chopin to tell his audience, in his broken
English, some thought that had just occurred
to him, has just died in Rome, aged 84. He
was Russian by birth and had been on the
concert platform for over 60 years—a dear,
simple old soul who loved all the world.
Vladimir de Pachmann’s most important
teacher was himself. His father, a professor
of Roman Law at Odessa University, taught
him the fiddle, but the boy preferred the
piano, and of the piano his father knew
next to nothing. So young Vladimir bought
huge piles of music—everything he could lay
hands on —apd ploughed through them with
such perseverance and acumen that when he
went to his first master, Dachs, at the age
of 18, he could play any of Bach’s Forty-
eight Fugues from memory in any key, and
had besides an encyclopedic repertoire. Liszt,
who attended De Pachmann’s first recital,
declared that the young man played Chopin
better than Chopin himself did. When well
over 70 De Pachmann decided that his play-
ing was all wrong in principle, and com-
pletely revised his method. Till near the
end he practised every day for from four to
ten hours.
Still another Australian writer is getting
good reviews abroad; but this Australian
has been settled in England for some time.
A year or So back Kenneth Attiwell’s
“Horizon” got the author talked about ,; now
Compton Mackenzie says of his “Steward!”
just published by John Long. “It is as fine
a piece of writing as I have enjoyed for
some time. It is also a vivid revelation of
the steward's life.”
Just answered the last summons, after a
visit to his native Australia, Harold Living-
ston Tapley, one of the business captains of
Dunedin (M.L.). “Tap” was born at Sema-
phore (S. Aus.) in 1875; he founded an
insurance and shipping business in Dunedin,
was mayor of the city for two terms and
! represented it in Parliament for one. He
was a fast friend of Commander Byrd, w 7 hom
he induced to make Dunedin his M.L. head-
quarters for the hop-off to Antarctica, and
was M.L. agent for the expedition.
Seldom does a pupil who has won wealth
remember his old schoolmaster in the way
A. E. Whitelaw, the former Australian, now
resident in London, has. Thinking that
A. O. Thiele, now retired, who taught him
at Doncaster (Vic.), might be feeling the
percentage cut in his pension, Whitelaw has
sent him £lOO with a promise of a similar
gift for each of the next four years. Aviator
Mollison and cricketer Bradman each re-
ceived £lOOO from Whitelaw because they
had helped to write Australia in larger let-
ters on the map.'
There’s not a priest in Australia who
knows the real back-country better than
Bishop Killian, of Pt. Augusta, whose mixed
flock wanders all over the north of S- Aus-
tralia. When he came first to this country
Bishop Dunne sent him to Bourke, and that
was 35 years ago;: 10 years later, when
R.O. Bishop KILLIAN.
Father Connolly retired (he’d been an army
chaplain in India), Ivfllian went to Broken
Hill as administrator. He was so solid a
success that in 1924 they made him Bishop
of Pt. Augusta, with headquarters at the
Peterborough railway junction. For most of
last year .He was a very sick bishop ; but he
is firmly on his feet again.
When Bulletin artist Frith dropped into
the Country party’s room at N.S.W. Parlia-
ment House recently he met an admirer in
Joseph Alexander Lawson, member for Mur-
ray. Joe produced from a pocket-book a
Frith caricature of 11. K. Nock, M.H.R. for
Riverina (N.S.W.), and grew rapturous. In
tne accompanying drawing the artist has cap-
tured the facial characteristics of Joseph him-

self. Its subject is a newcomer to politics.
H'e entered the House last June when he un-
seated Lang-planner Donovan by a majority
of about 1400 votes. Donovan had beaten
him for the seat in 1930 by a bare 121. Born
at Echuca (Vic.) 39 years ago, Lawson is
a wheatgrower in the Deniliquin district
and has filled a host of official positions in
associations devoted to the advancement of
the man on the land.
The Freetrade remnant in Vic. has lost
William Henry Renwick, president and chief
apostle of the Henry George foundation.
Head of a printery establishment in Mel-
bourne, he was a steadfast believer in Free-
trade, taxation of unimproved land values
and anti-socialism, and was twice mayor of
Camberwell. A hard-hitter, terribly in
earnest, he won the respect of those who
would have none of his doctrines. He
was 70.
“8.5.”: Apropos queer payments to par-
sons for performing the marriage ceremony.
In the ’seventies (or it may have been
earlier) in S. Aus., the late Rev. W. White-
field was asked to marry a young couple
who offered him in payment a quantity of
beeswax—“as far as it will go.” Another,
the Rev. Raymont, also of South Aus., after
marrying two young people at the manse at
Maitland, was presented with a drayload
of shellgrit for his garden “for services ren-
dered.”
With Professor McDougal (Law) retir-
ing, Professor McAulay (Physics) abroad
on leave, and Professor Hytten (Economics)
booked for a year by the Bank of N. S.
Wales, Tas. University’s professorial staff
is 33 per cent, below full strength. Law
lecturers G. L. Doyle and R. C. Wright will
carry on the law work until McDougal’s suc-
cessor is appointed; Dallas and other lec-
turers will keep the Economics flag flying ;
and the offsiders of Professor McAulay will
do their best with Physics in his absence.
McAulay is understood to be deeply inter-
ested in some important research work pro-
ceeding in a British university.
Memories of Agnes Buntine, the “white
mother of Gippsland,” have been revived in
Melbourne. Victoria’s first woman “bul-
locky,” she became the mother of Oippsland’s
first white child, and reared a large family.
From Walhalla she would drive her team
to Melbourne, returning over the rough,
mountainous country with loads of machin-
ery and stores. The risk of being attacked
by bushrangers (then prevalent) left her
cold. Once when hey assistant was wounded
after trying to shoot a kangaroo, she band-
aged the wound with a piece of her skirt
and sent him off, mounted, to the nearest
doctor; then the old lady drove both teams
into Walhalla. Years later she opened the
bridge that spans the Merri. But there is
no other monument to the bush heroine; and
Gippsland begins to think there should be.
Edmund Mac Donnell, who has run his last
traverse at iCairns, was for many years one
of the leading surveyors of N. Queensland,
particularly in the Gulf country, where he
was reputed to know every trig, mark by
its pet name. A North of Ireland man, he
came to Queensland as a youngster, and saw
pretty well every corner of his adopted
country at one time or another.

*Net funds apart from capital.
This 12-year-old is amongst the most pro-
mising of the younger set, but that unfortu-
nately does not mean all that it ought to.
Considering that from the jump the co. has
had the blessing of well-established farmers’
organisations throughout the Common-
wealth, it might have been expected to be
further along the road than it is. The
actuary’s second quinquennial overhaul
of the business as at the end of August,
1930, showed that the assurance fund in the
Ordinary department exceeded liabilities
under policies by £1206. But £0962 had
been distributed in bonuses, so the surplus
was really £5168. In the Industrial sec-
tion the lay-by was £30,056 short of the
fund. Still, only £1939 of the £30,056 was
in respect of the last 12 months, and on the
basis of 1930 figures the Industrial branch
was within 6 p.c. of the point where profits
emerge, the actuary said. In both depart-
ments combined, the leeway to be made up
at the close of accounts in 1930 was £17,816,
being the amount by which liabilities under
policies exceeded the book value of net
tangibles.
What progress, if any, the business has
since made in developing profit-earning, capa-
city cannot be stated definitely until the
actuary makes another overhaul. _ Appear-
ances are, however, that the co. is having
a hard struggle to negotiate the corner. It
is too early yet to talk about bonuses.
In the Ordinary department an extra
£173,588 of new business was put on the
books last year, mostly towards the close
of accounts: —
Ordinary:— 1930. 1931. 1932.
Policies issued . . 2,054 1,236 1,821

Renewal premiums . . 156,429 134,911 111,452
Interest and rent .. 16,733 24,001 18,181
Surrenders have obviously been heavy. They
account for most of the difference between
last year’s renewals and the previous years
first and renewal premiums combined. More-
over, surrenders retard the development of
bonus-earning capacity, notwithstanding that
the full reserve value of a policy is not paid
on surrender. One immediate effect has
been to bump up costs. Excluding the
tax bill and allowance for depreciation, etc.,
last year’s exes, ran off with 47 p.c. of the
net premiums as against 39 p.c. in the two
preceding' years. The year’s first premiums
cost 237 p.c. as against 249 p.c. and 186 p.c.
in 1931 and 1930 respectively; that is on
the generally-accepted basis that new busi-
ness is 10 times more expensive than old.
However, with the change in outlook sur-
renders should ease, and the figures gener-
ally improve in other respects.
in the Industrial section lapses have also
been heavy. Last year an extra £1462 of
new business was written (£582,966), but
total premium income (£20,845) was £6064
lighter; interest, etc, (£1551), was £940
better: —

Exes, took 71.6 p.c. of the gross income as
against 64.8, 65.9 and 91.7 p.c. in the three
preceding years. The amount paid in sur-
renders (£2867) was £2635 less than in ’3l.
The co. assumes that its funds will earn
4 p.c. Combining the figures of both de-
partments, last year’s net interest was 2.5
p.c. on average funds as against 4 p.c. in
the previous year. Taxation and the drop
in rentals is the trouble.

Assuming that the assurance funds and
liabilities under policies exactly equal each
other, then net tangibles were £18,410 short
of the mark when the books last closed.

In 1925 the Coastal Farmers’ Society, one
of the pioneers of co-operative marketing
in N. S. Wales, and the Berrima Co., an old
competitor, got into double harness, and the
present title was adopted; but Norco, a big
co-operative producer which used to market
through the C.F.S., broke away and estab-
lished its own selling-floor.
There was an all-round reduction of com-
mission charges following the merger, but
these had to be slightly increased a year or
so ago, owing to the collapse of prices. Butter,
bacon, cheese, eggs and fresh- and dried-
fruits figure largely in turnover, which, of
course, lias fluctuated with seasons and
markets, as the following table shows: —

Although more produce was handled, turn-
over slipped £86,692 during the 12 months
covered by the latest accounts. Overseas
Farmers’ Co-op. Federations, which set up
in London 10 years ago to handle Australian
dairy produce, etc., paid a div. (amount not
mentioned), and commissions, etc., improved
£1458; there were all-round savings amount-
ing t 0 ’ £6376 in exes., leaving the profit at
4.3 p.c. on capital. Shareholders, for whom
the two preceding sheets were dry, got 24
p.c., making the average 4.3 p.c. since the
merger. For their benefits members of
these organisations have to depend, largely
upon the savings made for them in com-
missions.
To knock £30,393 off the overdraft and
carry an extra £19,439 of stocks, £23,156
was added to the amount coming to sundry
creditors, and debtors’ balances were re-
duced by £16,613: —

The year’s improvement in the more or less
liquid surplus (£103,858) was £11,143.
When the books closed not much more than
one-quarter of the month’s turnover was
coming to consignors, while purchasing cus-
tomers owed for only a little over a fort-
night’s supplies.
As for the current term, good rains have
fallen throughout the dairying districts in
N. S. Wales; but Australian butter at 90s.
per cwt. or thereabouts in London shows a
drop of over IS p.c. compared with 12
months ago, while the Sydney price (now
1235. lOd. per cwt.) has slipped 10 p.c.

This is one of tlie most successful enter-
prises undertaken by returned men. It was
launched by the late Brigadier-General “Bob”
Smith, after he came home from the war in
1920. He got a loan of £50,000 (later in-
creased to £60,000) from the Commonwealth
Government at 6 p.c. This and a conserva-
tive dividend policy and the co-operative
nature of the business (Digger shareholders
can buy at cost; other Diggers get a special
cut) soon enabled the co. to stand on its
feet. By 1926 reserves began to accumulate,
and the div. has been steady at 7 p.c. for
the last five years, notwithstanding the
vicissitudes of that period.
Last year the tariff and exchange provided
fresh opportunities, arid the co. spent £10,860
on new plant, etc., for the manufacture of
high-grade textiles, previously imported.
Sales have not yet had a chance to benefit
from the new equipment; but the old plant
was busier, so, although prices eased, gross
earnings (£25,903) were £2147 better. Exes.
(£17,722) made off with £1299 of the in-
crease, leaving the net result £1449 in ex-
cess of the 7 p.c. div. However, unless the
rising tide of imports is checked, there is
danger of a curtailment of production by this
and other textile cos., with a consequent
spring in unit costs and drop in profits that
will deter further enterprise just when it is
most needed.
There is nothing to worry about in the

debtors’ balances look encouraging. Owing
to the outlay on fixed assets, the more or
less liquid surplus (£51,550, including stock)
was £2498 lighter than at the previous bal-
ance.

Speaking generally, there never has been
more need for the revision of wills nor
greater difficulties associated with the dis-
tribution of estates than at . the moment.
While these and other complications asso-
ciated with the administration of assets are
driving more business into the expert care
of the trustee cos., the extra responsibili-
ties have made it difficult to restrain the cost
of management, for which no further charge
has been made. On the other hand, the
shrinkage in values and the drop in interest
and rents have reduced corpus and other
commission earnings, etc., and profits and
dividends have suffered, of course.
The E., T. and A. (it is Australia’s second-
oldest trustee co.) added £550,3(16 net to the
volume of trusts on its books last year:

Gross earnings were £252 lighter, due, to a
drop of £1156 in interest and rents (*8270),
and exes, took an extra 365. of each £IUU
gathered. Allowing for the writing-off and
contribution to the staff fund, enough . re-
mained to show 8.4 p.c. on capital as against
10.2, 15.2, 15.8, 17.7 and ,17.1 p.c. back to
1927. The div. was kept at 8 p.c.; it had
been steady at 12 p.c. for the 11 years to
the close of accounts in 1930. To pay an
8 p.c. div., the co.’s own funds (capital and
reserves combined) need net only 3.8 p.c._;
and that leaves earnings from the trust busi-
ness out of the reckoning altogether. Pros-
pects, therefore, appear to be as assured as
anything of the sort can be these. days,
subject, of course, to the possibilities of
legislative interferences.
On the market the pound shares called
to ss. are steady at 10s. 6d. The return
at 10s. 6d. is 3.8 p.c. 0 n an 8 p.c. div. basis
or 4.7 p.c. should the distribution be raised
to 10 p.c. The net tangible cover is 41s. Bd.
When the books closed freehold figured at
£68,000; mortgages, £9359; other debtors,
£18,775; Government securities and cash,
£99,146; sundries, £17,506. There was only
£231 coming to creditors.
Strand and Pitt-street Properties, Ltd.
Shareholders in this Sydney co. are in an
unenviable position. The co. has been un-
able to meet the last instalment (£25,000)
of the purchase money and keep up regular
interest payments on the mortgages, and the
mortgagees have entered into possession.
Launched as recently as 1929. the co. bought
the eastern side of the Strand Arcade
as a letting proposition for £770,000
—£lso 000 cash and the balance on mort-
gage at 61 p.c. for 25 years. The public
was asked for £175,000, and the issue was
underwritten by Australian Investment
Trust. At June 30 last £156,655 had been
gathered. There was then £24,871 coming
to sundry creditors and £652,076 to the
mortgagees in respect of the original prin-
cipal and overdue ■ cash payment (together
£645,000) and accrued interest (£37,076).
The property and equipment figured at
£782,981; debtors, £5928; cash, £8467; pre-
payments, £3889 ; preliminary exes., £14,239 ;
p. and 1. debit, £48,097.
Though the property is situated in one
of the most valuable blocks in Sydney, its
worth to shareholders is what it can be
made to earn, and the fact that it is not
modern is a distinct handicap in this re-
spect. For the year to June 30 last ren-
tals, etc., brought in little more than half
what they did in the co.’s first term, and
preliminary exes, and trading losses com-
bined had run off with £62,336 of the capital:

The co. has certainly met with a sea of
troubles. Early in the piece a fire de-
stroyed the most expensive portion of the
premises, and though the statutory cut in
interest on the mortgage afforded a little
relief, it was not enough to offset the. shrink-
age in rentals, etc. The Australian In-
vestment Trust successfully appealed to the
Privy Council against a decision of the local
Court in respect of the underwriting agree-
ment ; but litigation in this matter
has been started again on fresh grounds.
Meantime, trouble developed with the mort-
gagees—Stewart Dawson Strand Property,
Ltd., and Stewart Dawson Pitt Street Pro-
perty. Ltd., who arc reported to have bought
the Strand property for £lOO,OOO and the
Pitt-street one for £223,290 in 1920 and
1922 respectively. It was agreed that they
should appoint a manager, under the co. s
control, and take whatever the business
might return after paying rates, taxes and
all other exes. This agreement, expired in
November, 1931, and the parties were un-
able to come to terms about a renewal.
Thereupon the mortgagees applied to the
Court, and an order was made allowing them
to enter into possession; they took control
on October 10 last. Out of revenue they
are to pay rates and taxes due to that date,
and the amount of the bill is to be added to
the mortgage debt. Prospects of shareholders
ever getting anything out of the business
are very gloomy.

Chief lesson to be learnt from the uninspir-
ing statistics of that table is the import-
ance of management. The co. set up in
Sydney at the end of 1926, and, in the
scramble to provide the public with credit
on the “pay as you earn” principle, it
quickly got its toes trodden on. To get a
footing a policy of absorption and amalga-
mation was adopted; also a cash-order con-
tract was secured with A.C.8., Ltd., which
runs a chain of shops in Queensland. Paid
capital grew from £28,134 at the end of
September, 1927, to £173,720, in 14,035 10
p.c. cum prefs. and 182,549 ords., at the
close of last accounts, when calls in arrears
amounted to £22,844. Apparently 3673
shares were forfeited during the year, and
the amount involved written off the book
value of the assets.
Following changes in the control and an
investigation of the co.’s affairs, a loss of
£35,980 was registered at the end of Sept.,
1930—£7434 of it was ascribed to the year’s
trading, and the balance to bad debts, etc.,
dating back to the beginning. Hard times,
the moratorium, and the drop in interest
brought more bad debts, added to overhead,
increased the difficulties of collection, and
reduced earnings, leaving the co. with a loss
of £B9Ol on the nine months’ trading to
June 30, 1931. Owing to the change in
outlook, no provision in addition to the ordi-
nary allowance for bad debts was made last
year (an extra £lO,OOO was allowed in the
previous term) and a profit of £2504 was
claimed. That reduced the amount of ord.
capital visibly unrepresented by tangibles
to £58,333 at June 30 last. So Bs. per
share is to be slashed off this capital,
reducing it to £109,530, including calls in
arrears at the close of accounts. The
cut will enable the board to wipe out the
visible deficit, and leave £14,686 for other
purposes.
During the year an extra, £13,517 net was
put out in loans, etc., and £8991 was added
to the debt: —

surplus* (£77,844, excluding investments)
was £4450. No hint is given as to what
the position in the subsidiaries is; the
shares appear at cost, which probably in-
cludes something for goodwill.
Allowing for the writing down, the pref.
div., less 22% p.c. statutory cut, and 5 p.c.
to the ords. will call for £6562 p.a. Assum-
ing that no sum remains for reserves, the

Ever since it took over the old proprietary
softgoods business of P. O. Fysh, of Laun-
ceston and Hobart, in the 1920 boom (the
price was £214,262), this co. has had diffi-
culty in keeping gross earnings m advance
of exes, and depreciation of stock. But
the management now appears to have tne
business more under control. The loss tor
the 12 months covered by the latest accounts
was £134; it was £149 for the Preceding
six months and £17,857 for the half-yea
before that. „ ,
In 1926 £15,597 was struck off the book
value of some of the assets . and £37,500 o
ord. capital was jettisoned in order to pu
the business on an even keel. But earn-
ings remained backward; for the three yea -
to the close of accounts in ’29 net profits
aggregated only £15,112.. Then slump
brought a sharp contraction m turnovei
and trouble with stocks and book debts, an
further heavy losses appeared. Thus, _ apart
from arrears of pref. divs. (L37,2wf,
£45,162 of capital was unrepresented by
tangibles at the close of last accounts.
To tidy up the sheet again, a further os.
(=£45,000) is to be struck off the oras.,
reducing them from 15s. to 9s. each.

There is a human story behind
this unusual picture.
•V/J
rv
SOME little time ago an Exhibition of Commercial Art was
held in Sydney, and the A.M.P. offered a prize for the
drawing that would best illustrate the peace of mind that
comes with A.M.P. membership. Of the many entries, this
drawing by Mr. M. B. Aley, Architect, was adjudged the
best, for, in simple form and wording, it teaches the great
lesson that an A.M.P. policy continues the home. There is
a world of sentiment in that phrase: continues the home.
Abundant proof is available. Recently a young husband
died in the prime of his life, leaving a widow and' two children
with nought but an A.M.P. policy between them and distress.
The policy was for £lOOO but, with bonuses, it totalled
£l4Ol/16/0, and it had cost the husband but £l9/4/2 a
year in premiums! How could a man invest so small a sum
to better advantage?
The first thing the widow did with the money was to pay off
the mortgage on her house. That ensured a roof over her
bairns. It continued the home. She then had nearly a
thousand pounds to invest in a little business, so that the
children might be educated, clothed and fed. Her husband’s
A.M.P. had met all her needs.
Full particulars as to the many kinds of A.M.P. policies may
be had from any officer or office of the Society.

To ease the pressure of fixed charges and
thus give the ords. a chance, 4s. per pref.
share (=£17,000) is to be returned. This
and the cut in the ords., already referred
to, will reduce paid capital to £135,500 in
'85,000 8 p.c. profs, of 16s. each and 150,000

year or so ago; but the improvement in last
year’s trading figures encourages the hope
that, with good buying, clean stocks and
a vigorous sales policy, satisfactory profits
will be won.
City Freeholds, Ltd.
Iu 1925 this co. took over Joynton Smith’s
Imperial Arcade and the freehold of the
Hotel Arcadia, paying £115,000 in cash and
£160,000 in ords. The public subscribed
for 130,000 8 p.c. cum. prefs. to help finance
the deal. The co. was lucky; Woolworths
took the basement, and the Arcade became
a way through from the Pitt-street block to
David Jones’s new store, thus enhancing
rental values. Notwithstanding slump, earn-
ings have never got much below the original
prospectus estimates of £18,783 p.a.
The co. has just issued 65,000 7 p.c. 2nd
prefs. for the purpose of buying from Joyn-
lon Smith two adjoining properties; one,
176 Pitt-street, occupied by Durno s Phar-
macy, the other the Arcadia Annex, occu-
pied by Woolworths and Hotel Arcadia, Ltd.
The new prospectus puts net profit for
the 12 months to June, 1932, at £lB,-.91
£873 more than the balance-sheet figure.
The difference is apparently made up by
excess provision for taxation. Allowing for
the first prefs.’ requirements, the balance of
last year’s profit (which, of course, was only
from the old properties) was equal to more
than twice the amount the seconds will call
for. The co. has undertaken to make no
deduction from the div. on account of the
10 p.c. Federal property tax, and the pros-
pectus specifically exempts the 2nd prefs.
from the interest reduction law.
Subject to £9475 of flotation exes., welded
on to the book, value of the freehold in 1927
(it may have been written off by this), the
net tangible backing amounts to £3 10s. 7d.
for the new shares.
During 1932 there was a sharp increase
in the gold yields of all States except Vic-
toria. Official estimates compare with the

“Old Warden”: M. H. Cutlack, with E.
A. Baker, a practical miner, announces the
discovery of considerable deposits of gold
and platium in the Eastern Division of
Thpua. The mainland section of this
division is tho smallest of the Papuan
administrative areas. .It first came under
Government control in the 1880 s, and
since then it has been criss-crossed in every
direction by Government officials and pros-
pectors, while it carries a heavy crop of mis-
sionaries to the souare mile. Further, gold-
mining on a fair scale was being carried
on at Cloudy and Milne bays close on 40
years ago. The news of the platinum is
interesting. It is described as being in
pieces as large as maize grains. This
sounds uncommonly like osmiridium, which
was found in fair quantities on the Eastern
Division goldfields long ago.

There is talk of opening up the old alluvial
field at Gulgong (N.S.W.), where geophysi-
cal prospecting by the magnetic method _is
in progress. The wash is up to 250 ft. thick
in places. It consists of sands, clay-pebble
beds and basalt lying upon slate and granite.
The field was extensively worked between
1870 and 1894, and yielded 500,0000 z. of
gold in its first seven years. The principal
lead was the Home Rule, which has a known
length of more than three miles and contained
over 2oz. of gold per cubic yard at the
southern end, where it was worked to a
depth of 100 ft. Interest now centres chiefly
in locating the course of the tributary leads
(Britannia, Red and ■ Periwinkle) and in
determining the continuation of the Home
Rule itself between and beyond the two
lines of bores, 250 feet deep, put down by
the N.S.W. Mines Department in 1901 and
1903. It is believed that the unworked
length of the Home Rule exceeds six miles.
The Black lead, in the same district, was
also an important producer in the early days.
But submerged and extensive basalt flows,
100 ft. thick, made the job of tracing its
course very difficult 30 years and more ago.
Still, the Imperial Geophysical Survey, under
Broughton Edge, was able to pick up and
follow the continuation of the Black lead,
besides locating an entirely new one.

Last year 106 gold-mining cos.' were regis-
tered in Victoria, with an aggregate sub-
scribed capital of £2,047,747, compared with
36 cos. with an aggregate of £674,820 in
1931. Of last year’s litter 71 were to
operate at Bendigo, Ballarat, Maldon, Wood’s
Point and other old Victorian fields, 12 ip

Crushings from the A 1 at Woods’ Point
(Vic.) have been poor so far —the first of
nearly 300 tons averaged 2dwt., and the
second sdwt. The co. proposes to continue
development and prepare for-cheaper mining.
Thanks to exchange and good manage-
ment, Wiluna is now in a much better posi-
tion financially and metallurgically than it
was a year ago. For the ten months to
the end of last October the plant put
through 275,181 tons of ore, and recovered
£599,918 worth of gold (Australian cur-
rency) for a working surplus of £277,231,
approximately £1 per ton. Over the same
period the recovery improved by 4.9 p.c. ;
it is expected to exceed 84 p.c. when the full
mill capacity of 40,000 tons monthly is being
treated, about the middle of this year. An
additional 478,000 tons was added to the
proved ore reserves last year, raising the
figure to 1,257,000 tons, assaying 335. 4d.
with gold at the statutory price. Further
leases to the west and south have been taken
up, and the co. now holds 1163 acres, alto-
gether. During this month the co. will re-
pay a further £50,000 of the £300,000 6 p.c.
seven-year notes, which are guaranteed by
the Commonwealth and Westralian Govern-
ments, leaving £225,000 to be redeemed.

Including the premium (75 p.c.), exchange
and charge for registration of transfer, the
cost of Boulder Perseverance’s new 10-year
10 p.c. profit-sharing notes of £5 each to
the Australian investor is approximately
£ll 10s. The notes, which are entitled to
50 p.c. of the profits, are repayable at a
premium of 20 p.c. on June 30, 1941, but
the co. has the right to redeem in whole or
part at any time after* June 30, 1936, on
the same terms. In 1932 the' co. netted
approximately £60.000. Including the new
lot, the total note issue will amount to
£50,000 (face value).

Shareholders in Lake View will shortly be
asked to agree to extra remuneration for
the directors. At present each member of
the board receives £lOO a year, with an
additional £5O for the chairman. Directors
are also entitled to divide 5 p.c. of profits
distributed in excess of 10 p.c. of the paid-
up capital, provided such extra remunera-
tion doesn’t exceed £2500 in any one year.
The board wants to provide payment of
£2OO a year to each director, with an extra
£lOO to the chairman, and to increase the
extra remuneration from £2500 to £lO,OOO
a year.

Associated (W.A.) increased its sterling
profit from £3415 in 1931 to £17,337 in

ciated mine at Kalgoorlie and a wad of

the price of gold keeps around the £8 mark

Melbourne interests are reported to have

The latest resurrection in the West is
the long-ago-laid-to-rest Wealtlh of Nations,
at Dunnsville, north of Coolgardie. This

received a big sum for it. Early returns
were dazzling, but they were not maintained.

Kimberley Options continues to get good
returns from its property at Patricia
(W.A.). The latest crushing 0 f 44 tons from
various stopes yielded 78|0z.; a parcel of

gave 320 z. Values are said to be improving

Waihi (M.L.) is now treating 18,500 tons
monthly as against an average of 14,700

has produced over 17 million pounds’ worth
of gold, and it looks good for a few years yet.

Next to Waihi, Backwater Mines, Reef-
ton, is the most important gold-producer
in the Dominion. It is now treating 3650
tons of ore monthly, the average recovery
being lldwt. as against 9.sdwt. during 1931.
The improvement is due partly to better
milling. The co.’s total yield to date is
440,080 oz.; and it still has large ore re-
serves. The market prices the pound shares
at 21s. (Auckland).

in sight, averaging 12dwt. per ton, to keep

ANY SUGGESTIONS TO OFFER?
Fixing Wool Prices
Dear Bulletin, —Australian opponents of
Australian wool pools are always, like Brad-
ford, chirping about the downfall of the
Brazilian coffee and the Canadian wheat
pools, and telling the woolgrower to remember
that and be a good boy. They never men-
tion .the. diamond monopoly to restrict output
and maintain price. Nor do they mention
the world’s petrol trust, which pushed up
the price 3d. a gallon in England recently.
Even old England’s Marketing Act helps the
farmer to better prices for his bacon. —Yours,
AiUG (Q.).
A Pedagogue in Defence
Dear Bulletin, —A writer (B. 23/11/’32)
gravely informs us that “a knowledge of the
capes of Europe or the names of Henry
VIII.’s wives” is not of the smallest import-
ance compared with the training of the
reasoning faculty. Well, we have known that
for a long time. We had it from Montaigne
m the sixteenth century, from Locke in the
seventeenth, from Rousseau in the eight-
eenth and from every educational theorist of
note since, down to our own times. Why,
then, do we not practise it? We do! But
it is difficult for the casual observer to dis-
tinguish between the knowledge a pupil has
and the educational value such knowledge
has had for him. How is it, then, that our
examiners test knowledge rather than think-
ing ability? They don’t! How long is it
since you have seen on a paper a question of
the type “Name the wives of Henry VIII.”?
This question, taken at random from a
Queensland Junior University paper, is
much more typical: “Whom do you consider
the greater despot, Charles I. or Cromwell?
Give reasons for your opinion.” Does this
test mere knowledge, or the ability to: mar-
shal facts and draw a logical conclusion?
Lastly, you may ask (and think you have us
here), “Does democracy, since the inception
of popular education, show any appreciable
increase in reasoning ability?” Well, for
the most part, the ability to reason is an
attribute of native intelligence (and there-
fore hereditary) rather than of environment
(e.g., schooling). Education works surely
but slowly on the masses. If you want
radical changes and quick, you must apply
to the racial eugenists.—Yours etc., K. M. C.
The N.S.W. Railway Service
Dear 8.,—-Cleary was right when he said
the lower grades of the N.S.W. railway Ser-
vice are very unsettled. Take the fettler, for
instance. He often lives isolated, has the
responsibility of keeping his track safe for
traffic, free of vermin and free of weeds, he
chips miles of firebreaks, maintains fences,
loads and unloads tons of material and gener-
ally is the P. 8.1. of the railway. Many of
the pioneer lines lie maintains were never in-
tended for the heavy wheat and fast stock
trains that are now belting them out of
shape. Rigid economy in replacement of
old materials adds to his worries. Always
low-paid, he has been the first to suffer re-
ductions. With rationing, wage-cuts, relief
tax and time lost, he is lucky iff he has aver-
aged £2 10s. per week over the last two years.
Yet he sees the heads of his branch multiply.
Where he was supervised by a travelling in-
spector, risen from the ranks, a bevy of
expensive engineers now rides through to
key him up to his work. He had a chance of
becoming an inspector, after many years
of work, but all such prospects of pro-
motion have vanished. He sees pet
schemes of departmental heads tried out
at his expense. Thanks to anomalies, there
have actually been cases where a ganger,
carrying the responsibility of eight to ten
miles of running road, has received less wages
than the men working under him. Men have
been transferred hundreds of miles from
their homes, and denied the home-passes that
were allowed before reorganisation. Some
of them have not seen their lidmes for six
months. Is it any wonder they are dis-
contented, and think Gleary should have
sacked a few dozen sycophants about
the throne, and replaced them with railway-
men ? —Yours, Arbeep.
The Sugar Industry
Dear Bulletin, —The sugar position is
not economically sound, and how long we
can keep national ideals overcoming stern
economic facts remains to be seen. The in-
dustry in general cannot be attacked on the
grounds of inefficiency. We take fewer tons
of cane to produce a ton of sugar than any
other country in the world, including Java
and Cuba. But, owing to the assigning of
lands which followed overproduction for home
consumption, cane is being grown on petered-
out land in the Northern Rivers of N. S.
Wales, in Nambour, Maryborough, Childers,
Bundaberg and in a lesser sense at Mackay.
These places, as well as petering out, are
really geographically unsuited for cane-grow-
ing, not getting sufficient rain or heat. All of
them were severely frosted this year—even
Mackay. Because of the assigning, cane
cannot be grown in many fertile places in
the Far North, where there are thousands
of acres of virgin scrubland and an adequate
rainfall and the necessary heat. If this
unassigned land could be used, three times
the crop per acre could be grown with the
same labor and expense; also the original
crop on new scrubland where heat and rain
are in abundance will ratoon five to seven
times. Another factor in economic waste
is that around Home Hill and Ayr cane
lands are irrigated at a cost of about £5
per acre per annum. Yet further north there
are thousands of idle acres with a rainfall
of over 100 inches. If no cane were grown
south of Ingham the industry would be more
efficient and the ideals of a White Australia
still preserved, with the price of sugar lower
and the grower just as well off. —Yours.
Ragus (Q.).
Is There a Way Out?
Dear Bulletin,— Since the depression
started, seasonal conditions have been ex-
cellent and production high; even with these
advantages growers have been steadily slip-
ping into bankruptcy. It is alleged, more or
less authoritatively, that the tariff raises
production costs 2d. per pound for wool and
sd. per bushel for wheat. Dealing with the
effect of tariffs on production, U.S. Presi-
dent-elect Roosevelt, speaking at Topeka
(U.S.A.), said:—
We must devise means to provide for the farmer’s
benefit which will give him the equivalent of what
the protected manufacturers get from the tariff.
An “equivalent” in Australia means an
annual 12 millions, and this is not inspiring.
There should be no insuperable difficulty
in getting a reliable estimate of the amount
advanced on rural lands, stock and chattels
by way of mortgages, liens, etc. Having got
this information, a board of practical men
should be appointed to deal with the follow-
ing questions:—
(1) The discount which mortgagees,
lienees, etc., would be prepared to allow for
settlement in cash or negotiable bonds.
Many mortgages, liens, p.n.’s, etc., are doubt-
ful assets, and mortgagees are facing heavy
losses and will welcome reasonable terms to
get them out of trouble. Having got liabili-
ties down to a minimum, the next step is—
(2) The issue of 3J per cent, bonds to
refinance these mortgages.
Paced with a national crisis, the investing
public, financial institutions and individuals
who now hold mortgages and liens would be
glad to take them up. From cash returns
storekeepers and others in need of money
could be paid off Yours etc., Valerin.
The Handicap of a Uni. Training
Dear Burretin, —The tale of unemployed
laborers, artisans, and so forth is so great
that another class of unemployed is seldom
heard of —professional people and those with
a higher education. Compared with the total
these are comparatively few, and as their
votes are not worth considering at election
time, they are neglected by politicians of
all parties. As one of this class who has
been “out” for nearly three years, might
I ask if w T e have any value in the com-
munity? We have become so accustomed
to the self-seeking tactics of politicians that
we have lost hope of getting anything from
them; but the apathy of the employer or
potential employer does hurt. In the com-
mercial world there is an unreasonable
prejudice against the products of. a uni-
versity. As an honors graduate I, in com-
mon with many others, have experienced
this. Do I apply for a position which does not
directly require my knowledge and training, I
am passed over for a boy just, leaving school.
And the fact that I would have to draw a
larget salary is not the sole cause: I am “too
old to fit into the job” and I have “been
to the university’’ (this last meaning that
I am in some way incapacitated). What
the employer fails to recognise is that by
virtue of a scientific training I am enabled
to think and act logically and to assimilate
facts quickly; further, that I have a better
sense of values than I had when I left
school. Consequently if the employer were
willing to spend a little time explaining
things fully, he would have a more efficient
employee than he will get when lie pitch-
forks a youth into his office and allows him
to “pick up things” as he goes along.—
Yours etc., Teedy.
Why Not Co-operate?
Dear B., —Australia with its large areas,
varied climates and conditions, and eorres-
pondingly varied occupations, presents excel-
lent opportunities for co-operation, yet very
little is practised. Most farmers regard
their own, property as an individual venture,
instead of as part of a, mighty system; and
as a result there is want and waste side
by side throughout the country.
Most of the poultry-farms in W.A. occupy
sa ndy areas on wliich' it is difficult and
expensive to grow suitable greenstuff's. The
poultrymen either utilise the manure from
t j lo runs themselves (not altogether a suit-
ajjie procedure, since most animals are re-
juc tant to eat food grown with their own
manure), or else they sell it to market
g ar deners. The gardeners often have head-

Dear Bulletin,— The community has
been shocked by the case of the Sydney
pos tal clerk who was blinded by a bandit,
The sentence of 35 years’ imprisonment is
heavy; and it is also terribly expensive. The
Judge who passed sentence in the case re-
gretted that he could not order a flogging;
our lawmakers should see that floggings can
be ordered in future. And we should go
farther. I suggest that when the next con-
victed bandit is being flogged the whole busi-
ness is broadcast, so that any potential
bandits can hear exactly what happens when
the cat-o’-nine-tails is used.—Yours, Bert

Testomania
The Melbourne Test seems to be ancient
history now, like Nineveh and Tyre and the
last suicide from the Sydney Harbor Bridge,
but the Sundry Showman still lias a lively
recollection of it. He went along accom-
panied by two perfectly good corns, wrapped
in a silk sock and the finest leather,
and of the 70,000 people at the M-C.G. fully
69,000 reminded him unnecessarily of tneir
existence by using the corns, slight as _wm
their elevation, as eminences from whicn
to survey the cricket. After struggling wi
the crowd until he was exhausted and m
danger of being trampled underfoot ana
buried under banana skins, the Showman
sought refuge in the press-box. Here lie got
an uninterrupted view of the proceedings
from a seat reserved for the overseas repre-
sentative of the London “Daily W nidbox,
who had presumably been overwhelmed ana
stamped to death by the mainly feminine
multitude. While in this favored position
the Showman had a telegram thrust into his
hand by a messenger who must have mis-
taken him for the' overseas representative
aforesaid. At a Test match there is no time
to put telegrams into envelopes, so the
Showman had read the communication be
fore he knew what he was doing. It reaa,
“Your stuff too matter-of-fact and bclatea
stop get a move on stop put some poetry
into it stop haven’t you got a soul stop
Daily Windbox stop.” In the absence ot the
accredited agent of the “Windbox the Show-
man felt he had to do something about it, so
he seized a pencil and a telegram form and
indited the following reply:
“When spring comes to our suburb it really is so
grand,
The elms they throw their seeds about enough to
beat the band,
And half go down the drains, half down the gutters
and
Why Nature is so wasteful I ne’er could understand.
And the kangaroo acacia shines like the golden
strand
And the voice of the lawnmower is loud in the land.
“When spring comes to our suburb it really is so
grand,
I feel as if all the wealth of Ind was at my sole
command.
The dandelion’s golden heads are scattered o’er the
land, ,
And the birds are all a-twitter with a music that s
not canned.
The breezes wave the gum-tree tops, the postman
waves his hand,
And the voice of the lawnmower is loud in the land.
“When spring comes to our suburb, my word, it is
so grand,
For happiness is everywhere, and sorrow it is banned.
The little plants put out their tender leaflets and
The snails put out their hungry heads, for every-
thing is planned.
The laughter of the children is heard on every hand.
And the voice of the lawnmower is loud in the land.”
There, didn’t seem to be much about cricket
in the communication, but it looked like
poetry and was up-to-date, in fact, ahead of
time, since the English spring isn’t due for
three months yet, and the Melbourne spring
won’t arrive for eight months, if at all. So the
Showman handed the telegram to the mes-
senger and tried to concentrate on the game.
As far as lie could see, it was played in
this wise. The requisite implements were
wickets, bats and a ball. The wickets, six
in number, were pitched in two sets of three
each, the distance between the sets being 22
yards. While the game was in progress the
centres, of interest were the batsmen, who,
bat in hand, stood each before one set of
wickets; the members of the other side
were disposed in various positions, as bowler,
wicketkeeper and fielders. From the one
set of wickets the bowler delivered the ball
towards the other, with the object of hitting
it; and it was the duty of the , batsman —
which, when the Australians were in, he did
not always perform to the public satisfac-
tion —to prevent this, as far as lay in his
power, by stopping the ball with his bat or

portions of Ms anatomy, or, if possible, by
hitting it to soihg v&cunt pluce in the field,
thus, perhaps, gaining time to exchange places
with tbe other batsman before the ball was
returned, and scoring what is called a run.
If, however, the ball, when delivered by the'
bowler, struck the wicket, through the bats-
man perhaps getting a fly in his eye and not
seeing it clearly, or if, though hit by the
bat, it was held by some fielder before it
touched the ground, or if it was returned to
either end of the pitch and hit the wicket
before the batsman arrived there —in these
cases, the batsman was “out” and had to
give place to another. This he did with a
great assumption of nonchalance, as if lie
had known what was going to happen and
didn’t mind in the least, in fact was rather
pleased about it than otherwise, that being
the real “cricket spirit.”
The foregoing bare account, however, doesn’t
give any idea of a Test match as surveyed
from the press-box at the M.C.G. • What
actually happens is that a dread silence
reigns amongst the vast concourse assembled
in concentric rings round the arena. The-
silence is so profound that the zipping ■of
a banana by a small boy in a distant stand
can be heard distinctly. A question, uii-;
spoken but palpable, “Will Hammond stop
the rot?” floats in the air. It even per-
meates the ether in invisible waves, so that
the same dread silence is spread to light-
houses, prospectors’ camps and South Sea
islands, and reigns above the din of city-
streets thousands of miles away. It would
even fall like a pall on London, only London
happens to be in its bed—or ought to be.
Then something occurs —only the press
cameras know exactly what —and .a deep
roar goes up from the startled multitude.
Fifty' sporting reporters in the press-box
leap straight up in the air, but, having their
emotions under the control of their sense
of duty, they have no sooner descended than
they seize telegram forms and write furi-
ously, and in less than a few seconds the
forms are fluttering like homing birds over
the heads of their colleagues into the tele-
graph station up above. As if swept by
the same emotions as the crowd the tele-
graph instruments break out in a nervous

crescendo of chattering sound,' which dies
down as Mr. Hammond disappears, into the
pavilion. Another batsman, looking to un-
practised eyes exactly like the' last one,
then comes out, and the process is gone
through all over again. It was repeated be-
fore packed houses for four days, the. same
waits and the same dramatic crises. At
the grand finale there was a bellow of tri-
umph such as might have conie from the
throats of a thousand brazen trumpets: the
crowd rushed the ground, the pitch; was
removed in sections as holy relics, and dur-
ing the demonstration Woodfull was kissed
on the cheek by a strange man.
As a student of the drama the Showman
was puzzled rather than enlightened iby
what he saw of the second Test. If J, C.
Williamson put on a dramatic performance
lasting four nights, in which there was _no
hero, no villain, and no beautiful heroine,
and the only comic relief was Jardine’s Har-
lequin cap, and the appearance of a dis-
engaged character with a tray of soft drinks

a damsel has put it on record in tlie “Argus”-
that she sat from 8 a.m. on Tuesday till

seat in the sun in order to see the final
curtain of the M.C.G.’s show. Moreover,
the characters in the M.C.G. draina' were
all males, and looked so much .alike that pre-
sent writer had six Australian fieldsmen
pointed out as Bradman by six different
devotees of the game. The umpires have
more lines allotted to them than anybody
else in the cast, but they are entirely lacking
in sex appeal, when viewed from the stands,,
and even such a national idol as a .spin
bowler begins to look less heroic.- after jpu

couple of hours in the deep field. Testo-
mania is a puzzle all right, but perhaps the
poets of the press-box could explain it, an
they would. They have the theatrical press-
agents beaten hands down.
The principal excuse for the revival of
“Our Miss Gibbs” was provided by the
evident delight with which the piece
was received by* the young folk at
Her Majesty’s, Sydney. It came to
them as freshly as it did to the generation
that applauded the first performances. An-
other good reason for revamping the trine
is that the Firm has practically an ideal
cast for it. Gus Bluett and Leo Eranklyn,
both accomplished 'extempore comedians,; in-
fuse, life into the libretto .between the lines,
as it were, and ‘ the ornamental parts of
Hughie rierrepont and Mary Gibbs-are; em-
bellished by the dancing of Cyril Ritchard
and Madge Elliott.

Caryll'calibre, makes? no exigeant .demands

and appropriate scenery complete the recipe
for a workmanlike. production. , Saturday
night’s. performance, went through, in the
happy-family . atmosphere characteristic of
Sydney first night’s. Every member of the
co. 'seemed to have about 500 personal
friends in front,, all imbued with wild en-
thusiasm, and the play was pushed into the
background time after time while. comedian
or soubrette' acknowledged an ovation—a
breach of ’ stage conventions that the recent
opera season had done much to propagate.
At the end of the. show Smith-
due to hop across the Tasman on the night

of The Bulletin, was' brought on to the
stage by E. J. Tait, who talked about “gQod
old ’buses,” a phrase that applies both to
“Our Miss Gibbs” and the Southern Cross.
Kingsford Smith brought down the house
with his apology for the absence of his lady.
“She’s occupied with domestic affairs,” he
explained; and then, after a little pause, and
shyly: “It’s a boy.”

Sheridan’s “The School for Scandal”
deals with a frailty of human nature which
the years have done nothing to eradicate, and
the play has as strong a human interest
now as ever. The revival of the comedy -at
Sydney Savoy by Doris Fitton’s Independent
Theatre co. provided a performance that got
very near the spirit of the thing. John Gould,
who made Sir Peter Teazle a convincing
figure, was partnered by Terese Desmond,
whose Lady Teazle was very entertaining.
Clive Coppard, though suffering from lapses
of memory, put some fine work into.the part
of Joseph Surface. Others of the co. who
merit mention were Edward Howell, John
Dense and Houghton Honey. Jean Lawson,
as Lady Sneerwell, and Dulcie Cohen, as
Mrs. Candour, we/e well placed. Doris
Fitton was producer and Don Finley de-
signed the scenery. The Independents’ next'
production will be Sil-Vara’s “Caprice,” a
comedy of Viennese life.

dike announced that G. B. Shaw and Gil-
bert Murray were the greatest living ortho-
dox Christians. On the following day the
papers printed the cable • reviewing Shaw s
latest book, a terrific onslaught on the Bible.
“Der Pooltock Preed” : As a hundred per
cent, true-blue Union Jack Britisher, I wel-
come the opportunity we have now of visit-
ing the 1 British talkies. It makes my blood
tingle when I see that great Englishman
Otto von Schwillwinger take the pure, sweet
English' girl Grctchen Bangmuller m his
arms and murmur in her ear, “Mein schveet,
I loqf you”—not in nasal Americanism, but
in the beautiful accent of Oxford. Mean-
while that fine old English gentleman Hein-
rich Wigelhauser is giving them his bless-
ing, and the dainty soubrette Freda Mug-
genheim is providing the comic relief. It
is such actors as these which make me enter
a picture show humming “The British
Grenadiers” and emerge singing lustily the
National Anthem.
“Cutlibert”: It seems about time that
Sydney theatres abandoned the pretence that
stage performances commence at eight. The
experience of the last 20 years, to go no
further back, should have convinced manage-
ments that it- is practically impossible to
get an audience assembled by that hour.
A case in point was the opening performance
of “Autumn Crocus,” at the Royal. Accord-
ing to the advertisement the time of starting
was i 7.50. Nobody believed it, and it was
nearly 8.10 before the curtain went up, and
8 45 before the last of the circle seats had
been slammed down. In writer’s experience
of Sydney stage shows and concerts during
the last five-years only one season- —that of
Galli-Curci —stands out on the score of punc-
tuality. Amelita’s custom was to take the
platform as the Town Hall clock was strik-
ing, and to launch her first note as soon as
the reverberations of that horologe had
ceased. Like other, and less punctual recital-
ists of note she had the doors barred while
she was performing. As an alternative to
that drastic method of preventing interrup-
tions. I suggest that theatrical entrepreneurs
should advertise I—and 1 —and keep to 8.15 as the
time of commencement. "
“Norbell”: Emilie Melville, almost forgot-
ten in Australia, for whom the curtain has
fallen ih San Francisco at the age of 81,
made her filial bow on the stage there in
“The Royal Family” two years ago. Her
Australian appearances ranged from 18 < 5
to 1908. In her prime she was- a .beautiful
and vivacious artist, who shone in Fati-
nitza,” “The Royal Middy,” ‘La Belle
Helene” and’ countless opera-lonffe roles.
Armes Beaumont, Verdi, Farley, Leopold,
Harding and many other front-rank singers
of those far-off, opulent days figured with
her and dainty little Grade Plaisted was
her protegee. John Forde, who passed ou
in Melbourne the other day, was the last o
that artistic band.
“Hamfat”: Continuous vaudeville has
made its appearance at the London
houses ; in one week’s trial the Pavilion look
£3200, paid by 30,000 people, and other
places immediately followed its example. A.
a matter of fact it is a very old idea, used
formerly in the English provinces, especially
in, festival seasons. The performances be»a
in the afternoon and went, on from then to
midnight, and the programme usually in-
cluded “hall-clearing” turns—truly teiiible
affairs. The phrase “merely an emptiei
has almost been forgotten, but there was a
t ; mc when Svdnev knew it well. About
30 years ago one Crawley, previously theat-
ricaleditor of the - “Referee,” opened the
Oxford Hall in George-street (where the
Crystal Palace came later) with continuous
vaudeville. He used “the.flicks* then new,
very raw and very irritating, for the hal
clearing.

p. Coral"; An elderly Thursday Island
native wandered into a business place the
other day and, after having his wants
attended to, asked another fuzzy-head near
by: “You got ha’penny?” None being forth-
coming, he put the query to several others
without result. “What you want ha’penny
for? inquired the man behind the counter.
“You got plenty pennies there.” “No. this

“Hamer”; “The thirstiest town in Qrs-
tralia,” said the man on the park seat who
had had his last haircut in 1930, “was
Spongeville. It ain’t there no more. It’s
the place where rain comes only once in

an’ there’s a sound like a millyun baths

dragged down inter the soil. An hour after
the sun comes out once more you can’t see
nothing but dust again ; the soil ’as sucked
up all the rain. You can imagine ’ow

two lorry-loads of it, an’ it went just like
the rain does. Not a drop left in a coupler
days. Of course the publican sent, orf post-
haste for noo and bigger supplies, but they
’ad to come a long distance, and the in’abitants
decided to meet ’em ’arf way. They inter-
cepted the beer 15 miles out; an’’ •it went
just as quick as the first lot. They returned
ter wait, fer more; but again they got im-
patient. This time the wallop was met 40
miles away; and the next lot was stopped 80
miles from Spongeville, the one that follered
310 miles away. Finally the ’ole popper-
lation reached Bingville, 150 miles away,
an’ met the licker on the source of supply,
so ter speak. After that it was decided that
it was too far to go back, an’ Spongeville
ceased to exist. I thought I’d like ter ’ave
a look at the old place after all them years.
To my ser prise I found ’an ole bloke
there ’oo ’ad ’is share of the pub’s first

“M.L.C.”: The blue wren is often seen

“Turn Turn” : Here’s a new way to catch
the petty thief. I live in a native village
on Guadalcanal, Solomon Islands, and
recently I lost a small saucepan. The head-
man guaranteed to find it, and that afternoon
I was asked to go along to witness the cere-
mony. On arrival at the “court” I found
they were going to try making each suspect
carry a hot stone over a measured distance,
on the theory that only the guilty party
would get his hands burnt. I promptly
“tambu’d” that, for I knew I’d be treating
burnt hands for a week afterwards. A
wise old man from the hills was brought
down next day. With him he fetched
a small turtle shell which he filled with
water from a certain spring. Each suspect
was required to gaze for a moment at his
reflection in the water, and the wise old
bird gazed into it after each one. The face
of the thief, he remarked grimly at the
end of the test, had been left behind. There
was no public denunciation of the criminal,
but next morning the saucepan was returned
to me.

“Markis o’ Granby”: There is little doubt
that “Deekay” (B. 28,/12/’32) is right in
attributing the origin of the expression “Q.K.”
to the superlative rum flavored with pine-
apple which was once distilled in Aux Cayes
in the West Indies. It is curious that Queens-
land, a great rum-producing country, should
never have thought of the pineapple flavor-
ing. It had a great vogue in Britain in the
glorious days of punch. Who can forget Stig-
gins in “Pickwick Papers” when asked by
Sam Weller in the Fleet prison what his
“tap” was. “All taps is wanities,” replied
Stiggins. “Well, then, if I may ask, wot
is your particular wanity?” it was, of
course, pineapple rum with hot water and
sugar.

“Kiriwina”; Treating the hair with lime
(B. 28/12/’32) is t a common practice among
nearly all Pacific natives, including Papuans,
Melanesians, Micronesians and Polynesians.
The Hanuabada people of Port Moresby, with
their huge mops of hair, and the far-away
Fijians and others are equally addicted to

the practice. To some extent it is a beauty
treatment, since the lime turns the hair a
bricky red for some time and the effect is
not unpleasing. The chief reason for it}
however, is the “walkabouts” which have
their perennial being in the Pacific Islander’s
thatch. These are temporarily extirpated
by the lime dressing, with that passing relief
which most members of the A.I.F. enjoyed
at one time or another.

“John Dory”: Those who have the idea
that cats hate water have never been out
with a fishing fleet. Most cutters which lie
alongside wharfs and jetties when in port
soon become well stocked with mice and rats,
and having a eat on board is the only w'ay
to keep the pests down. The cat who adopts
a cutter as his home soon gets to disregard
water. If you bring fish into port and take
them ashore in the dinghy, Tom lets
you know that he wants to come, too. If
you leave him on board a couple of hundred
yards of water won’t deter him from paying
his friends ashore a visit. He dives over-
board and strikes out for the nearest landing
spot just as a dog would. But when he re-
turns at daybreak he never swims back to
the boat; instead he sits on the jetty steps
and raises a horrible miauwing until his curs-
ing owner gets into the dinghy and sculls over
to fetch liim aboard. And the cat who takes
to the sea life is always an exceptionally
good scrapper, no doubt due to the good
tucker he enjoys. No cat I’ve ever had
aboard my packet has ever seemed any the
worse for; a night out, but after he has" beep
ashore the Toms of the town look as if they
had been put through a chaffcutter.

“Plankton”: In the lower walks of life
there are a few fishes, spiders and even
prawns which can make some kind of noise,
but Java possesses a musical worm, Peri-
chwta musica. It sometimes grows to a
couple of feet in length, and distinguishes
itself by producing an interrupted series of
sharp staccato sounds. This “music” is
made apparently by the friction of the
bristles on the creature’s body against stones
or similar hard substances, somewhat after
the style of the old-fashioned musical-box
with its spiky cylinder.
JACK GOES HOME AT DAWN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Dawn is the dairymaid of the blue heaven.
.She works for the farmer whose paddock
is Space.
You may not believe, yet her veins hold the
leaven
That cost Mother Eve and her husband
God’s grace.
And Dawn like a wanton, wild wench is now
wending
Her way to her bed from a wild night.
I note
She’s flying the colors of love, but pretending
She’s hunted the cloud-cows away from
the oat.
Like star-rain in brilliance her sidelong
soft glances;
And comets a-glow on her lips have been
born.
Yet Dawn is pretending, as homeward .she
dances,
She’s paddocked the moon-bull and cloud-
cows this morn !
But I understand why her pulses are leaping,
A love-sea that breaks over shoals, over
bars.
Yet .she tries to make out that she just has
been sweeping
The Milky Way dairy of dust of the stars.
Let Dawn just pretend (it’s your privilege,
ladies!)
She’s been to a love-tryst on Saturn’s
green ring
With a bloke who is one of the brothers
Pleiades
That, work for old Taurus, the cow-cocky
king!
So Dawn to her daybed a-.skipping is going—
I see her silk petticoat pink on the hill.
But devil a stone, lad, can I think of
throwing
(You can’t in a glass-house), for I come
from Jill!

SAVE AND PROFIT
Piling shillings one upon another may be a form of thrift, but it is a
risky method—and unprofitable. There is loss of profit because the
same money, placed in a Commonwealth Savings Bank, would earn
interest. There is risk of loss by fire, by burglary, even by inadvertence,
and, not so obvious but quite definite, there is the risk of temptation
to spend.
The Savings Bank Account is the logical place for your savings, for
there they both accumulate and earn interest. Thus your saving power
is multiplied, your savings become profitable, and you are less tempted
to spend wastefully.

WHEN MAKING YOUR WILL
REMEMBER THIS
[ANY men believe that in making their will they are
bequeathing their whole property to their dependents.
In actual fact this is not so. Probate tax makes a
heavy inroad into many bequests. To overcome this difficulty,
the P. & C. Probate Assurance was evolved. It provides the
ideal solution, pays for probate tax, obviates forced sales and
provides adequate money for dependents during the long assess-
ment period. Discuss the matter with their representatives or

“Pterogoplieros”: Queensland, which has
a somewhat chequered reputation in the
matter of safeguarding its native fauna, has
hurriedly declared two large areas sanctu-
aries for ’possums. In the districts con-
cerned there has been an epidemic of cattle
poisoning, due to eating the caterpillar of
the saw-fly. This creature lays its eggs on
the leaves of the silver-leaf ironbark. When
the caterpillars are hatched they drop into
the grass, where they are picked up by the
cattle, often with fatal results. The ’possum
eats the leaves, saw-fly eggs and all, thus
saving the lives of many cattle. The whole
thing is an interesting example of how
blundering interference by man with natural
laws is apt to upset the balance of things.

“Gumblegubbin” ; Old horses is it? On the
Valley of Lagoons station (Q.) there was
a mare called Oleander, foaled in 1872. I
don’t know when the veteran passed out, but
she was alive 12 years ago, and was then
48. She was toothless, and subsisted on
soft grasses that fringed the lagoons.
Though well bred —being by Vanquish, a
son of Sir Hercules, and her dam by Free-
trader, a winner of the Liverpool Grand
National Steeplechase—her stud career was
short, for she was the best camp horse on
the station, and was worked till late in her
long life.

“Scalper” : Queensland is finding that his-
tory repeats itself. Years ago, Marsupial
Boards and other authorities paid hand-
somely for the scalps or heads of creatures
supposed to be inimical to the pastoral and
agricultural industries. If real scalps or

heads were scarce there were other ways
of collecting. Fifty or a hundred wallaby
scalps at 4d. each could be carved out of a
single skin by an expert, and when these had
acquired a bouquet and had shrivelled they
passed muster. Dingo and kangaroo scalps
were similarly manufactured, and for those
lacking the necessary skill every township
had' its hordes of spare,- tame dogs which
supplied indubitable dingo scalps after death.
One dead bird’s head is very much like an-
other if kept long enough, and fruit-eating
birds were impersonated by all and sundry,
including barnyard chickens, if these were
handy and owned by somebody - else. Even
crow heads could be, and were, forged on
occasion. This sort of thing killed the golden
goose of the bonus. Some five years ago the
idea was revived, and to-day the authorities
have sadly realised that the old ramps have
been working overtime. The whole matter
is to be reviewed, and it is more than likely
that in future the scalper will be expected
to produce his prey alive.

“Kalong”: There are still good pickings
to be found in Australia by the man who
knows how to look for them. The fruit-
growing district of Woodford in Queensland
offered a bonus for the destruction of flying
foxes. A man who tackled the job thoroughly
has for some time averaged from £3OO to
£4OO per month. This is almost as profitable
as exerting a telepathic influence on poli-
ticians who issue tin-hare licenses.

“Heresone”: “Avon” (B. 14/12/’32) will
need more evidence in favor of his “sporting
chance” that Celt and Maori come of a
common stock before it carries my money.
Both he and “A.H.8.” overlook the import-
ance of environment. The Maori, like the
Gelt, is a dweller among hills and forests,
and so believes in wood and river spirits.
Personification of trees is as natural a pro-
cess as the formation of metaphors, such as
“the great forester,” to which it leads. His
tribal system, similar to the Scottish and
Irish clan system, and his rather inclement
clime would make the Maori hardy and
warlike, and war cultivates humor and
happy-go-luckiness. Similarity of odd words
or legends means nothing, for such simi-
larity is found between the myths of places
as widely separated as Greece, Norway and
Mexico.

a very similar bit of mythology from an old
Araucanian Indian while kicking about the
Andes behind the Gulf of Corcovado in
Chile. It all started through a fight be-
tween the Goddess of the Mountains and
the Goddess of the Sea, both enormous ser-
pents. The former was good, the latter
evil. Vainly the Goddess of the Mountains
warned the wicked ones, who worshipped
the Goddess of the Sea, that a final struggle
for supremacy impended. A few believers
sought safety, starting to climb to the top
of the Andes. Then the Goddess of the Sea
unleashed her fury, drowned all her own
adherents and commenced to rise in pursuit
of her rival’s worshippers. For 40 days
and 40 nights (my informant had never
read Genesis) the sea chased them up the
mountains. They reached the top, where
their reptilian deity protected them and the
baffled waters receded. The Argentine
pampas, a vast stretch of treeless silt washed
clean across the continent from the Andes,
is reliable evidence of this flood, which must
have occurred about the time dinosaurs,
trieeratops and other “okbis” were running
CO-OPERATION.
THE BAGMAN: “Any chance of a job about here, Boss?”
THE BOSS: “Well, you could come in with one of us cockies and go fifty-fifty in
what we ain’t makin’”
loose. I was on the pampas with a geolo-
gical expedition in 1924, and 30 yards out
from a barren beach near Bahia Blanca we
struck a patch containing the bones of 16
different kinds of prehistoric monsters. At
low tide we used to wade out and bring
them in. Unquestionably the “okbis” had
been swirled .out of the Andes when the sea
and mountains went to war.

“7346”: Last year near Griffith (N.S.W.)
a pair of magpies built in a fiuit. tiee
nest entirely composed of short pieces ot
wire, carefully interlaced _ and, ranging in
gauge from case-tying wire to Pieces ot
No. 8. During last pruning the limb bear-
ing the nest was removed; so this year
Mr. and Mrs. Maggie constructed another
nest in a near-by evergreen, where they are
not likely to be disturbed. Again the nest
consists of wire, with a little dried grass
and a feather or two to make things com-
fortable inside.
“Tidapa”: There’s a simple explanation
as to how pieces of wire became twisted
around the antlers of the deer found dead
in National Park, N.S.W. (B. 21/12/32).
During my week-ends I endeavor to cultivate
a garden plot at Bundeena, on the National
Park side of Port Hacking, but as fast as
any vegetables show above the ground they
are eaten down by the deer. The fence
around my shack is 6ft. high, but I have,
seen the deer take this in their stride. In
an endeavor to save their cabbages, local
residents have had to build wire entangle-
ments around their gardens over 12ft. high.
The deer often make valiant attempts to
get through, and frequently take away sec-
tions of the wire around their antlers as
a memento.

“Pick”: We had caught a number of more
genteel fish, so we heaved the common wir-
rahs and leather-jackets overboard. Imme-
diately there was a flurry and the phos-
phorescent outline of a big shark appeared
in the moonlight abeam. At a camp stove,
lighted forward for a billy of tea, my mate
made an iron sinker red-hot, dropped it
within the maw of . a leathery, and lobbed
the sizzling bait at the nose-end of the
enemy. Things then began to happen. The
sea-lawyer broached from the water, flapped
the ripples resoundingly with head and
tail, and made the lake hiss with fran-
tic plunges that drenched us with spray
and dangerously rocked the boat. He
swirled around with such rapidity that
when, to avoid a collision, we upped the kel-
lick, we couldn’t find a gap through the
circles. At last, like a torpedo, Mr. Shark
shot his quivering length along the surface,
and grounded on a sandbank.

“Bono Mata.ni” ; The custom of anointing
themselves with juices from dead bodies was
not confined to the inhabitants of portions of
British North Borneo (B. 14/12/’32). It
was prevalent in the Manus tribe, who live in
the southern part of the Admiralty Islands
group, until the practice was stopped by the
authorities. These particularly virile sea-
nomads used to build their villages on
piles in the sea, generally between two
islands, so as to afford good observation _in
case of attack and to have a quick line
of retreat if needed. Before they came
under control their chief pastimes were fish-
ing and fighting, the latter for preference.
Failing enemies, the clans would fight among
themselves. They continued their activities
long after the first whites had settled in that
part of the Pacific, and on several occasions
attacked and captured schooners, which they
burnt, after looting them and murdering the
crews. It was not until Fritz cape along
with a gunboat and played fireworks with
several of their villages that they decided
to be good boys.

“Sinbad”: What explanation can members
of the Council offer for this? Entering
Georgia Strait I saw the hull only of a
vessel making for Vancouver Island, Three
hundred yards astern of her came her funnels
and masts sailing through the air on their
own. It was a dull afternoon.

“D.G.S.” : The fact that the motor nerves
of the tortoise are practically independent
of the brain b.as been proved by the Italian
naturalist Predi. He opened the skull of a
tortoise and removed the brain. To make
sure, he scraped and washed out the cavity
until no particle of nervous matter was left.
The tortoise appeared to show no suffering
and merely closed its eyes. Its life went
on as before. In three days the skull, wound
was healed. The operation was performed
in November and the animal lived until May
15 of the following year. Predi carried out
a number of such experiments with varying
results; on some of the reptiles there was
no visible effect; in others, loss of move-
ment followed brain excision. Some tortoises
lived only a week. Not content, Predi cut
the head off a tortoise. It lived for 23 days
and could move its legs, though unable to
walk. Two other tortoises possessed so
much vital energy that their hearts con-
tinued to beat and their blood to circulate
twelve davs after their heads had been cut
off!
SPELL-OH!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The axe Ts still that rang the morning
through'
With steady stroke amidst the crashing
trees.
The leaves hang motionless, save when the
breeze
Lives in one breath, and dies, and stirs
anew.
The silence ebbs in soundless waves and
flows,
As though the sea were beating on a shore
Far o’er the farthest tree-clad range—felt
more
Than heard; and lazy smoke, gum-scented,
blows.
So, gazing upwards, out of half-closed eyes,
I float into a world of lovely shades —
Blue sky beyond grey branches tapering,
And blue dissolving wisps of smoke that
rise
Among green leaves, where ever leaps and
fades
The crimson flame of the rosefla’s wing.

THE HIGHER JOURNALISM.
The “Sunday Tripe,” in pursuance of its
avowed intention of giving its manifold
readers the intellectual fare they want, takes
pride in introducing to its great reading
public the famous “Blabba,” Sydney’s bril-
liant pony-urger, whose scintillating wit,
pungent epigrams, and sparkling bons mots

weekly impressions (exclusive to the
“Tripe”), shot through with all that whimsi-
cal drollery and espieglerie that have made
his name a byword wherever Shakspeare’s

SHADOW SHOWS.
In “Sport of a Nation” Richard Arlen is
a shamateur footballer who makes money
by signing testimonials to the merits of his
country’s produce. That might have been
overlooked if he hadn’t fallen into the toils
of the nymphomaniacal daughter of a mil-
lionaire and taken to hooch and gambling.
So he gravitates to the inevitable park bench,
and adjusts his hat at an angle which be-
speaks ruin to every experienced film-goer.
Hardly has he got the usual jarb trundling
the customary wheelbarrow when he learns
that his younger brother Barb has become
a football star. His next discovery is that
the misguided lad has become entangled with
the millionaire’s daughter above-mentioned.
He detaches Barb, and returns him to his
young wife, by employing the body theory on
him iii the Test match All Stars v. America.
Barb is exasperated into landing him one; is
sent off the field in disgrace, and is thereby
convinced of the worthlessness of his wife’s
rival. All ends happily, with the provision of
a comfortable position for Richard by a
wealthy young man who had the honor of
being lamed for life by him at college. The
redeeming features of the silly story are its
brisk movement and the photography, which
is excellent in its slick, hard way.
It is a Hollywood tradition that ladies
who have prolonged love affairs with mar-
ried plutocrats are always good at heart.
Irene Dunn plays another of them in “Babk
Street.” She first meets John Boles in 1900.
For 32 weary years their liaison continues,
while John rises in the world and begets
children who regard her with understandable
disapproval, and while she sweetly but firmly
refuses to he made an honest woman of by
an old admirer. The closing sequences, which
make no concession to the popular liking
for a happy ending, are admirable as re-
gards the dialogue and the settings and the
fine restraint of the acting. But it is a
feeble production on the whole. The hero-
ine, in an age of padded coiffures and hour-
glass figures, displays modern hats and a
1932 waist; and half the women in the
badly-handled crowds wear short skirts.
Boles hasn’t attempted to dress in period
either.

Judging by the number in circulation,
Hollywood makes the - manufacture of
murder films a routine business. Sydney
Haymarket’s principal attraction this week,
“Discarded Lovers,” is typical of the genre.
Irma Gladden (Natalie Moorehead), a tem-
peramental film star, is done to death. Sus-
pect Number One is her first husband,
Suspect Number Two is her second husband,
whom she was on the point of divorcing
so that she might marry suspect Number
Three, the man who wrote the dialogue for
her pictures. Suspect Number Four is the
director of her films, and suspect Number
Five is the director’s wife. Suspect Num-
ber Six is her chauffeur, and he is promptly
arrested. The police make the usual
blunders. They allow one of the suspects
to bolt and apother is murdered while in-
vestigations are in progress. It is left to
a bright young reporter and the charming
female secretary of the deceased to convict
Number Throe. Before Number Three com-
mits suicide he almost kills the bright young
reporter, paving the way for a tender hos-
pital scene at the fade-out. Sharon Lynn,
Russell Hopton and Jason Robards helped
Moss Moorehead to give the fantasy a veneer
of reality.
“Two-fisted Love,” also at the Haymarket,
is a drab cowboy picture out of which even
the small boys who line the front seats must
find it difficult to get a thrill. Tim McCoy,
as Tim' Clarke, is cheated out of his ranch
by a crook, goes into the hills to look for
silver, finds gold instead, and returns just
i n time to stop the same crook from taking
the heroine’s ranch from her. Gun-play, a
bank robbery and a lot of horses fill some of
the s P ace betwe « n tit > e and wedding bells,
_._ * * ,
t0 ?5? acting, an appealing story and a
beautiful setting among the forests of the
Sierras make Salomy Jane, at Sydney
Regent, pleasing but a lot of moth-eaten
aaelodrama intrudes. Joan Bennett is a wild
slip of a girl wooed Fy the daredevil camp
Stabler, Ralph Bellamy, who wears the
traditional frock-coat and top-hat. She eon-
yinces him that she does not love him, and
J be . n > haying been insulted by the local poli-
cian’ declares she will marry his killer,
Later a stranger (Charles Farrell), searcli-
or bis sister s betrayer. Unbeknown to
Salomy he kills the villain and takes to the
mountains. Salomy and lie meet. They love,
b arrell is taken, but escapes and, with the
aid of Bellamy, gets over the line to hap.pi-
ness with Salomy. Bellamy and Eugene
Pallette, as the kindly, boastful stage-driver,
divide the honors between them. A sub-plot
provides opportunities for weeping for those
so disposed.
Though hotter than its title. “Too Busy
to Work,” also at Sydney Regent, opens
poorly, Will Rogers, as a philosophic tramp
looking- for the man who stole his wife and
daughter while lie was helping America. to
win the war, lias the first quarter of the film
to himself, and the solo is not very entertain-
ing. At long last Rogers finds liis daughter
—his wife is dead—happily looking forward
to marriage with the son of her step-
father. Rogers reveals himself to his enemy
(Frederick Burton), a highly-respected
Judge, saves his daughter’s lover (Dick
Powell) from being falsely accused of mur-
der, and then moves along the road again,
Marion Nixon plays the daughter accept-
ably.

“L.M.N.”: The Motion Picture Academy
of Arts and Sciences (U.S.A.) has given
its merit award for 1932 to Helen Hayes,
whose “Arrowsmith” was adjudged the best
piece of work by any actress during the
year. The gold statuette for the best actor
goes to Fred March (“Dr. Jekyll and
Mr. Hyde”). Two specials were also
awarded, one to Wallace Beery for his work
in “The Champ” and the other to Walt
Disney, the creator of Mickey Mouse,
“Grand Hotel,” which was very disappoint-
ing to Sydney audiences, was declared the
outstanding picture of the year. “Shang-
hai Express,” “Bad Girl” and “Trans-
atlantic”'were others mentioned. Of course,
Hollywood films only are judged; no other
countries need apply.

Ranji’s diamond belt seems to be quite
a popular myth among Australian girls.
The value of this glittering fabrication is
estimated at two million pounds sterling, or
thereabouts, and the dear creatures believe
that their own sweet prince will keep it in
reserve for the last Test match, as a special
device for dazzling the Australian bowlers.
The Indian prince was almost mobbed in
Adelaide on the second day of the Test
match. A large crowd of women crowded
outside his hotel after the day’s play, and
waited patiently for a glimpse of their
idol. Strange that whilst Adelaide society
women called him “the dear prince,” the
lower ordahs simply dubbed him “Liquo-
rice !” [29/l/’9B.]. '
“Combo”: In view of recent utterances
of English cricketers I suggest that the fol-
lowing new rules for the conduct of the
game be got ready for next season
(1) The members of the public who are not
English barrackers must preserve the strictest
silence during the progress of the game.
(2) Any person not an English barracker wishing
to speak must first obtain a written permit signed
by all the members of the English team.
(3) The band will play “God Save the Queen’’
whenever (a) an Australian gets out ; (b) an
Englishman makes a run; (e) an Englishman stops
a fourer. The public will thereupon rise and take
off its hat, standing reverently until the band stops.
It dan then sit down.
(4) At the conclusion of the day’s play, if it
has been in favor of the Englishmen, the public
will take off its hat and sing “God Save the Queen”
and “Rule Britannia.”
(5) If it has not been in favor of the English-
men the band will play “The Dead March in Saul,”
and the public will proceed at slow march (and
in silence) out of the ground.

ALL FLIES FOUND ON THE GROUND WILL BE

A WESTRALTAN NEWSPAPER
REPORT.
A brilliant coterie last evening assembled
nt the recently-erected handsome edifice
known as the Hungry-quartz Hotel, at the
invitation of Mr. McGinty, the genial, land-
lord. No expense has been spared in the
erection, which compares favorably with any
of our first-class city hotels —in fact, to
ensure satisfaction Mr. McGinty was his
own contractor, and built it himself during
his spare hours.
The picturesque corrugated-iron walls of
the bar are decorated with artistic and
costly frames, compassing oleographs of
exceeding rich coloring—Mr. McGinty has
ever been a patron of the fine arts. The
room is brilliantly lighted throughout with
kerosene lamps. The two large oxB rooms
at the rear are devoted solely to the use of
the popular landlord and family. It shows
a great confidence in our resources when
capitalists are willing to invest in such’ a
truly regal manner.
Several gentlemen, mostly engaged in
underground pursuits, comprised the house-
warming party. Mr. McGinty, after a happy
welcoming speech,
asked the company to
drink success to the
house, which request
was acceded to with
perfect honhomie in
beakers of “shypoo.”
“Two bob in and
the winner shouts”
w’as the next item on
the programme. The
winner—Mr. Stumpy
Grumps, managed- of
the Slime Pits De-
partment at the Call
Due G. M. Co., Ltd. —
gracefully asked Mr.
McGinty to now join
his guests. That
gentleman smilingly
bowed his acknowledg-
ment to the compliment paid him.
Mr. Scratchpen, the talented representa-
tive of the Hoolgarlie “Bustler,” proposed
the toast of Mr. McGinty, coupled with
“The Queen” and the mining industry.
Mr. McGinty, in responding, said he was
pleased to have his name coupled with the
Queen on such an occasion as the Jubilee
celebration year. It was a time when all
differences should be sunk. From that
moment lie would sink all resentment against
her Majesty, with w 7 hom he had been on
bitter terms for many years past. He was
content to let bygones be bygones. He
would ask the guests to fill their glasses.
Mr. Scratchpen was courteously conducted
to his cab by several of the company, and
carefully packed away in the bottom of the
vehicle. The act of vandalism of stealing
the front door, smashing the window, and
wrecking the rear of the building, which
occurred later on in the evening, is attributed
to a low gang of ruffians from the Other
Side who have been frequenting the neighbor-
hood lately. [ll/12/’97.]
A certain “colonial” cricketer who went
’Ome a*s a professional for the last English
cricket season was rather familar with the
British amachaws, and was told .that “he
would have to address the —haw —gentlemen
players as ‘mistah.’ ” He did so. That same
afternoon, when one of them missed a catch
off his bowling: “I say, Mister Blanky
Spats,” he shouted, “get a blanky bag!”
[l9/2/’9B.J
If Ran ji publishes his Australian impres-
sions in full they should prove interesting
reading. Consequent upon a win at Ken-
sington on Saturday, he sent a message to
the jockey that he would be given a fiver
if he called round in the evening. A hulking
horsey person weighing about 12 stone duly
called and drew a fiver from the innocent
Indian potentate, but his back was hardly
out of sight when the real jockey turned up.
Ranji couldn’t see it at first, but he eventu-
ally ladled out another fiver, and any quan-
tity of language. At the time, of writing,
the full strength of Sydney’s detective-force
were on the trail of the 12-stoner.

The British House of Commons is con-
sidering a bill for the suppression of the
Italian organ-grinder and flute obligato fiend
from Sh'airmany. It provides that when-
ever these monsters commence to shudder and
moan on any instrument outside any inhab-
ited premises, the householder may move
them on upon his own responsibility for a
distance of 440 yards. The organ-demon
must go at o.nce and without remonstrance,
else he is liable to arrest. He must not
toot on his weapon of torture as he goes,
else he is also liable to arrest. When he
has gone he must remain away—if he comes
back and blows his tuneful melody within
the prohibited line he is liable to arrest
some more. When he gets to the end of his
journey and starts to fill the air afresh with
the ruins of his wild, sad song, and another
householder rushes out and orders him to go
another 440 yards, he must go at once, else
he will be arrested instantly; and if a third
Individual drops on him before he has ground
out the first bar of his tale of woe he must
simply keep on going. He must do it cheer-
fully, too; if he blasphemes as he makes his
twenty-seventh removal he will be arrested
on the spot. If anybody within a quarter
of a mile of him in any direction objects
to his wail and lamentation he must pack
up at once and put 440 yards between him
and tlie complainant—failing which he will
be run in. If there is a yard short, in the
measurement, he will be jugged at once. If
there are individuals in all directions who
complain of him. then he must simply get
out of the locality altogether, otherwise he
will be copped straight off. It is a far-reach-
ing bill, and promises to be very successful,
but the wear and tear of the organ-grinder
will be tremendous. [23/5/’9l.]

THE FIRST AXIOM.
“Well, what do you want?” Harley asked.
He had just been interrupted once in a diffi-
cult explanation of an arithmetical problem,
and this second interruption was a little too
much for his patience. Harley was not a
model teacher. He couldn’t keep in a groove,
he was too versatile. There was no even
tenor in Harley’s way. He could explain
the knottiest problem in the most lucid
manner, propound the wisest doctrine,
unravel the mysteries
of the causes that
actuated men to cer-
tain deeds in history,
teach for an hour in
a manner that held
his hearers breathless,
stirred their intellects
to solve, or their
minds to apply—but
then Harley would
shut off steam and
drift. Then the school
drifted, too. Harley’s
brilliancy was inter-
mittent, his genius
displayed itself in
meteoric flashes. He
w r a.s no born instruc-
tor, he was an eluci-
dator —for an hour —
and his hours were
far apart. The
teacher must keep on, keep on, cause
and effect, effect and cause, a continuous
stream, logical deduction, logical conclusion.
This, however, is not notes of a lesson on
.school-management.
Harley looked impatiently at the child
before him —-a little girl with dirty, naked
feet, unkempt hair, and untidy, torn skirt.
Harley hated dirt—he was cleanly to a
degree. Teaching was all very well, he used
to say, but the associations in the public
schools were trying, very trying. With a
superior class of children he did not object
to the work, but the dirt, the uncouth
manner, the rough and vulgar speech, these
were too much for Harley’s patience. He
never recognised that he was there to remove
them, to raise the standard, improve the con-
ditions, and so to find pleasure and reward
in his work. “Why don’t you work, child?”
said Harley fiercely. The class tittered;
Harley scowled, and there was silence • the
class knew Harley—there was a cane rest-
ing against the easel.
The girl held out a note. It w 7 as written
on a leaf of an exercise-book, and it was
dirty.
Piece i have to keep this girl atQme for Lissy
smith Beating her every day she is Coming home
frpm school she vated yestday and pulled her hair
and theumped her on the back witch maid my

“Oh!” said Harley slowly and question-
ingly. The girl twisted a dirty part of her
skirt into a comer, and began to bite it,
THE “S: M. HERALD” PUPLET.
OLD GRANNY: “Well, I’m sure I tried every-
thing, and now I have to give him up

It died late in July, 1893.]
pulling it in jerks every now and then from
between her teeth. Harley took up his cane
and tapped on the board. The whole school
came to silence and attention in a moment.
The teachers fell back from before their
classes, or looked up from their work among
the pupils.
“Mr. Brown, send Lizzie Smith to me.”
“Lizzie Smith, go to Mr. Harley.” Lizzie
Smith rose and came.
“The school —resume work!” said Harley.
The school resumed. “Old Harley might
have got that youngster without stopping
all the school. I wonder how he’d like to
be pulled up every now and then in his
work,” grumbled one pupil-teacher to an-
other near him. “He himself is always
pulling up, that’s why he doesn’t see it. As
is the teacher, so is the school!” “Don’t
growl, go in for a move if you don’t like
it,” was the answer; “there are worse than
Harley.”
“Well, Lizzie Smith, have you been thump-
ing Mary Ryan?” Harley aske.d severely.
“Please, sir, no, sir; I never done nothin’
to ’er. Please, sir, she’s alius callin’ us
names, sir—me an’ me sister,” answered
Lizzie Smith, looking at Harley with vulgar
resentment, shocked that he should think of
asking her such a question, accusing her of
such an offence.
“Please, sir, she did!” asserted Mary
Ryan, nodding her head expressively at
Lizzie Smith',
Harley took a long breath and looked at
them.
“Get along, Mary Ryan.” Marv got. “And
as for you, Lizzie Smith, leave Mary Ryan
alone, that’s all, or you’ll get into trouble;
go back to your class. I’ll enquire further.”
Lizzie indignantly went.
Harley’s explanation was spoiled. He set
his class a silent lesson, and drifted. Noon
came and the school was dismissed. The
subject for the afternoon was Euclid.
Harley had resumed, and he and his class
were once' more intent. Lizzie Smith’ came
in ten minutes late. She handed a note
to’ Harley. More interruption! Harley
thought the note was ; for being late. “Go
to your place,” said Harley, putting the
note aside, unread.
“Please, Mother Says to read what she s
writ.” Harley stared. Lizzie Smith looked
vindictive. Harley took up the note again.
Sir, I rite these lines to you to let you know' that
what Mrs. Ryan said to you in her note was untrue,
A RELIC.
Smith: “Why do you make such a fuss
over timt old croaker? She can't sang a

able to look out the gate for fear of her chasing
them.
Yours, Mrs. Smith.
Harley held the note abstractedly, ponder-
ing what he should do. He had
kept Mrs. Ryan’s note. He
took it from his pocket and
compared it with the other.
Lizzie Smith stood contemplat-
ing him, expectant. The boy
who had been demonstrating a
proposition upon the board,
noting Harley’s long abstrac-
tion, took up again his proof.
His words broke on Harley’s
ears: “And since things that
are equal to the same thing are
equal to one another, by the
first axiom; therefore”. - -
“Stop!” cried Harley, “I didn’t
tell you to resume. Go to your
place, Lizzie Smith. Go on
now,” he said, turning again to
the boy. The boy had solved the problem.

THE
STUFF TO GIVE 'EM
MEGGITT'S LINSEED MEAL
THE BALANCED RATION.
“Alf Alpha”: There are dairymen who
regard the cow as a kind of machine, to be
fed with fuel of good, bad or indifferent
quality until it breaks down, or works irre-
gularly and uneconomically; then it is
scrapped. With more care in the selection
of fuel, the use of lubricants, the replace-
ment of worn parts and so on, the machine
will last longer and do better work than
when these things are not considered.
\ The first thought of the cow is to eat
sufficient to live —body maintenance. Any
food she can obtain over and above this
requirement goes towards milk production,
body fat and reproduction. Milk is a liquid
containing many compounds, needed in defi-
nite proportions.. Protein is required from
food to produce casein and albumen. Carbo-
hydrates produce the butter-fat a.nd the milk-
sugar. Minerals make up the calcium, phos-
phorus, etc., which are present in the ash
of the milk. For every 3|lb. of protein
supplied in the food for milk production
there must be approximately Bilb. of carbo-
hydrates (starch, sugars, etc.).
The first step in balancing the ration
is to provide nutrients in the most econo-
mical form. They must be palatable, slightly
laxative and rich enough in protein to build
up and repair hair, muscle and all tissue;
they must also contain sufficient carbo-
hydrates to produce a body fat reserve for
the maintenance of body heat, and for pro-
viding the energy necessary to consume,
digest and turn foods into milk, likewise
sufficient minerals for building up and re-
pairing the framework of tlie beast, and at
certain times forming the framework of its
young. Protein requirements of a cow are
found by adding what is needed daily
for the maintenance of the body to what is
needed to produce a given number of pounds
of milk. The amount of carbohydrates re-
quired daily is likewise calculated by adding
the pounds essential for body maintenance to
what is necessary for the formation of the
milk produced. Specialists in stock feeding
inform us that a cow weighing 10001 b. will
need daily ,71b. of crude digestible protein
and 7.91 b. of total digestible nutrients for
body maintenance only. Three gallons per
day of milk containing 3.5 p.c. fat will
require 1.51 b. of digestible protein and
7.551 b. of total digestible nutrients; to pro-
duce this amount of milk the food fed daily
must contain 2.21 b. of digestible protein
(.71b. for maintenance, plus 1.51 b. for milk)
and 15.451 b. of total digestible nutrients
(7.91 b. for maintenance, plus 7.551 b. for
milk).
Here is a mixture which is calculated to
provide a 10001 b. cow with all the nutri-
ents to produce 3 gallons of 3.5 test milk
per day:—
Digestible Total Digestible
Protein. Nutrients.
Shandy chaff . . 201 b. .36 6.76
Lucerne hay . . 101 b. .97 4.20
Oats .. .. 31b. .24 1.79
Linseed meal . . lib. .30 .78
Bran .. .. 31b. .32 1.70
Total .. .. 2.19 15.23
The mixture is calculated as a full-time
job, the cow receiving no other food. Should
it be estimated that she is grazing, say,
201 b. of average pasture daily, it would be
necessary to recalculate the mixture and to
set off the grass nutrients against those con-
tained in the chaff and hay. To blend the
proteins barley may be used occasionally in
place of oats.
AN EXPERIMENT IN SUBDIVISION.
“Rosebery”: “O’Gorman’s” remarks on
the drawbacks of subdivision (B. 21/12/’32)
are in some respects fairly correct; the
initial expense of establishing a rotational
grazing system certainly is high. Neverthe-
less a modified scheme that makes use of
existing fences is worth while. I started a
rotational grazing system four years ago. It
has been a decided success. ■
My block of 200 acres had previously been
subdivided for cropping. With very little
extra fencing, I divided it further into seven
paddocks. Water is plentiful for eight
months of the year; it is'a Victorian dis-
trict with a 30in. rainfall. During three
months I adhere to a rigid system of rota-
tion. The stock are changed in regular
sequence every eight days or thereabouts;
there is slight variation to allow for differ-
ent carrying capacities of the paddocks.
Sheep and dry cattle are grazed, the cattle
being always three paddocks behind the
sheep. In this way the grass is kept fresh
enough to be relished by the cattle, which
are close enough behind to be forced to
concentrate on the ranker growths left by
the sheep. Thus neither class of stock has
to be starved into close grazing.
In the spring I miss one paddock out of
the rotation. This is left for meadow hay.
The sacrifice from grazing in the flush period
is practically unnoticed; it takes only a
short time for the grass to grow sufficiently
for cutting. In the summer I am forced
to modify my plans to allow for dearth of
water; there is permanent water in only
three places. By merely opening a few
"gates I confine the rotation to three pad-
docks. The growing period of the herbage
has ended anyhow, and until the dry spell
breaks I content myself with occasional
changes for the sake of freshness.
I may add that I have always practised
pasture-improvement, the use of licks and
the planting of shelter belts.
PASTURE ON SWAMP SOILS.
For many years lucerne has been grown,
with the aid of irrigation, on reclaimed
swamp land along the lower reaches of the
Murray. The Morphetts, of Wood’s Point
(S.A.), were first in the field, and until
recent years they cut and fed their lucerne
to dairy cattle. But the heavy cutting and
carting costs involved prompted them to try
laying down permanent pastures; so a little
over four years ago they, sowed 5.8 acres of
heavy clay. land near their homestead with
a seed mixture of 351 b. to the acre—lslb. of
perennial rye-grass, 51b. each of Italian rye-
grass and prairie grass, 31b. of cocksfoot, lib.
of meadow foxtail and 61b. of red,alsike and
white clover. Top-dressing with super. (3cwt.
per acre in March) and sulphate of ammonia
(fewt. per acre in September) was prac-
tised, and the area was subdivided into six
small paddocks to admit of rotational graz-
ing. By 1930 the pasture was well estab-
lished, and arrangements were made with
the Waite Institute for a twelvemonth’s
comparative tests.
An account of the institute’s investigations
is contributed by Professor Richardson and
H. P. C. Gallus to a bulletin published by
the Council for Scientific and Industrial
Research. It is extremely interesting, and
so is the story of what the Morphetts did
subsequently.
The experimental area having proved itself,
they prepared 70 acres of swamp soil, previ-
ously under lucerne, for permanent pasture,
using this time 361 b. per acre of mixed seed.
They reduced the proportion of perennial
rye-grass to 101 b. per acre, and increased
that of cocksfoot to 101 b. The 70 acres were
subdivided into six paddocks, which for a
year were grazed by sheep at 24-day intervals,
each being grazed for four days in regular
rotation, and allowed to grow for 20 days.
From January 1 to July 6 they carried
hoggets; from July 7 to Dec. 31, grown
wethers. Six months after seeding grazing
had been maintained for months in late
summer and autumn at a steady level of 19
sheep per acre. At the end of June the
pasture carried six sheep per acre, but with
the advent of warm weather in spring the
carrying capacity rapidly increased. With
the flush of rye-grass in early November and
the flush of white and red clover in mid-
summer, it rose to 20.6 sheep per acre for
52 days. In effect the 70 acres of pasture
maintained sheep at a mean stocking
capacity of 16.2 sheep per acre throughout
the year.
Summarising the results of comparative
grazing trials, Prof. Richardson says: “On
natural pastures at the Waite Institute,
where conditions of winter rainfall and
summer drought prevail, Merino sheep make
rapid gains in weight from June to October,
retain their body weight during the summer,
and lose considerable weight in autumn. On
the irrigated pastures at Wood’s Point, even
under conditions of intensive stocking, the
sheep make rapid gains in live weight during
spring and summer months, and maintain
their weight during autumn and- winter.”
TRACTORS PREFERRED.
“XYZ” : I was born on a wheat-farm in
the Wimmera, and have been wheat-farming
on my own account for 28 years. For nine
years I have used a tractor, and the tractor
will always do me. Mine cost £560. The
working life of a tractor, according to “Jay
Gee,” is six years. It may be so; but
during those six years, in the hands of a
capable man, your tractor will do more work
than the best three 10-horse teams ever
foaled. In the north-west of N. S. Wales
our dumb friends are not in it against the
tractor.
“Jay Gee” must have grand animals. He
has no deaths, no sickness, and carries on
with no spares. Of course, as he says,
during every working moment the tractor
consumes fuel and oil, but the moment your
job is finished this expense ceases. Not so
with a team. As for buying and replacing
parts, my experience has been that there
is no great difference. I often had to replace
a horse, sometimes two, on a horse-team
farm.
“Jay Gee” reckons a 10-year-old team
worth as much as one four years old. He
is on flimsy ground there. As for a 22-year-
old team —well, those venerable nags would
break no cultivator points. In our north-
west N.S.W. neighborhood, time is the
essence of the operation in all instances.
This is where the horse fails; climatic con-
ditions are against him. The heaviest work
is put through in December, January and
February.
IS SUPER. ESSENTIAL?
“Woorinen”: The fact that some land
grows crops without super, (B. 7/12/’32)
proves very little. “Nugget” Lowrie, of the
Swan Hill (Vic.) flats, claims that he has
grown oats on land which has been cropped
continuously for 30 years without super.
He is the star oaten-hay grower of the dis-
trict; his land is black river silt, feet deep,
rich with the reserves of centuries. When
he crops his red loam land, he uses super.
Look around the Mallee and you see this
peculiar thing: the older the land (that is,
the more it is used), the better it gets.
The crop-rotation system and the residual
effect of super, leave the grass land in better
heart for grazing, and the older Mallee
always grows more wheat than the new. ,
Mr. Penman, soil chemist for Vic. Ag.
Dept., tells me it is twelve years before
the final trace of one dressing of super, is
taken from the soil. Hence continual dress-
ings with super, tend to leave a reserve of
phosphates in it. It might, therefore, be
feasible to reduce super, dressings for a
year or two *on soils which have been treated
for years, providing just enough to be quickly
available to the seedling to push it on in the
spring. Bailey, the American authority on
agriculture, states that the word “manure”
is derived from the French verb “man-
oeuvrer,” the French idea being always that
constant tillage enriches the soil. One or
two big vignerons in the south of France
still work on this idea. They use no arti-
ficial manures and their ground is never
worked more than two or three inches deep,
but is kept continually stirred by cultivation.
They claim that this constant turning over
induces nitrification and gives the same
effect as artificial manures. European soils
are rich in phosphates; Australian soils are
poor in this element. Hence it is not suffi-
cient alone to increase nitrification; the phos-
phates must be applied.
SHOWER-DIPS.
“Woorah”: Obviously “W.D.McC 1 .” (B.
9/11/’B2) has never used an efficient shower-
dip. As an inventor of one which proved
itself for several years in southern Queens-
land, I claim that, if properly constructed,
they are “out on their own.” We built
ours in two sections, side by side, each to
hold about 70 sheep, put in fairly loosely.
While one section was being showered for
ten minutes the other was draining for seven
minutes.
Double gates the full width of each end
save time and knocking about, and the sheep
don’t get dip-shy, as with the swim. Ewes
on the point of lambing can be dipped with-
out fear of any ill effects. Have the holes
in your shower the size of No. 10 wire and
a pump that will keep the shower (12in.
deep) half-full. After the sheep are left to
drain for seven minutes, turn up as many
as you like; you won’t find any dry spots.
You can put through 3000 a day without
any effort. If you want to increase your
capacity construct a larger dip, which is
more than you can do with the swim. Three
men can do the job comfortably.
CHEAP MEAT.
“Cull” : One of the problems always con-
fronting the pastoralist is, the disposal of
aged sheep. Hitherto the favorite method
has been to ship the beasts to Sydney or
other metropolitan centres to bring what
they will fetch ; but it yields no more than a
trifling margin on trucking and other costs,
and it results in a lot of meat going
on to the market which is not fit to eat.
Much has been made by statisticians of the
drop in average meat prices. It is no exag-
geration to say that these low prices are
due to the flooding of shops, with old car-
cases, bought for a song and retailed accord-
ingly. Most of the ewes still capable of
lambing are mated before being sent to
market, this tending to fatten them. The
meat from sheep in this condition is really
unfit for human consumption, while the
lamb is sacrificed into the bargain. Cattle,
particularly old cows, are often sent to
market in the same way, regardless of the
fact that cattle in poor store condition are
specially subject to stock diesases.
The remedy from the pastoralist’s point
of view would seem to be a reversion to the
old boiling-down system, which was a use-
ful method of disposing of unwanted stock
in the old days. This could be done, as it
was years ago, on the run itself. Tallow is
always a marketable commodity, while the
skins and the saving in freight to markets
would be other considerations worth taking
into account.
TOBACCO ON SANDY SOILS.
“Nick Q’Teen” : At least 60 per cent, of
the tobacco crop of the U.S.A. is grown on
sandy or sandy loam soils. Soils of this
type are the poorest in natural plant food;
many of them may be likened to the pure
sand cultures used by scientists in their
attempts to discover the actual mineral
requirements of plants. These investiga-
tions have shown that at least ten elements
need to be taken into account when consider-
ing the needs of the plant: nitrogen, phos-
phorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium,
sulphur, chlorine, iron, manganese and boron.
These elements are present in varying
amounts in all soils, and their relative
abundance determines the value of the soil
for crop cultivation under a given set of
conditions.
In Victoria and, I suppose, in other parts
of Australia, people undertaking the culture
of tobacco are placing soil first and climate
second. The soil most sought is the poor,
sandy type, as illustrated by the sandy loams
of Pomonal and the sand occurring in East
Gippsland. The percentage of golden bright
high-grade leaf from these areas is much
greater than in the crops produced from the
heavier and richer soils of the north-east
and the Goulburn Valley. Recent studies in
America have indicated the possibility of
trouble arising from the continued use of
sandy soils which are not only very poor
in nitrogen, phosphoric acid and potash, but
contain an extremely small amount of
secondary elements. With deficiency in the
latter, the use of the usual artificial ferti-
lisers to correct the former may aggravate
or hasten trouble from the absence of second-
ary elements. The system in vogue in the
U.S.A. may well be copied in Australia" when
tobacco-farming is practised bn these types
of soil.
A deficiency in nitrogen is shown by the
whole plant assuming a liglit-green color,
with a “firing” (drying) of the lower leaves
to a light-brown , color. A shortage of phos-
phoric acid produces plants having an
abnormally dark-green appearance; a short-
age of potassium is indicated by a few yellow-
ish spots or specks on the tips and margins of
the lower leaves. In the case of magnesium
deficiency, this condition appears as light-
green or white spots. The leaves are inclined
to roll in the case of a potash deficiency,
and in the case of a lack of magnesium
they cup up or turn the other way. Calcium
shortage is noticeable as a peculiar hooking
downward of the tips of the young leaves
composing the bud, followed by a breaking
down of these leaves at the tips and mar-
gins. In some cases the terminal bud dies.
Deficiencies of sulphur and manganese are
not usual, and so far iron and boron defi-
ciencies have not been observed. Chlorine
in the form of soluble chloride is definitely
regarded as a menace when present in any
quantity, but a small amount is just as
definitely recognised as essential to the well-
being of the plant.
Deficiencies detected by the practical
tobacco-grower are made good by dressings
of super, to supply phosphoric acid, lime and
sulphur; of sodium nitrate, sulphate of
ammonia and dried blood in the case of nitro-
gen deficiency; and of sulphate of potash in
the case of a shortage in potash and, inci-
dentally, sulphur. Epsom salts are used as a
source of magnesia; common salt in small
quantity in case of chlorine deficiency.
For the production of golden bright leaf
on poor sandy soils, and more particularly
on areas showing signs of exhaustion, this
fertiliser mixture is recommended: Super.,
3cwt.; nitrate of soda, £cwt.; sulphate of
ammonia, -JowL : dried blood, lAcwt. ; sul-
phate of potash, lewt.; Epsom salts, fewt. :
common salt, |cwt. In other countries
it is used per acre at an approximate
cost of £3; in Victoria it would probably
cost £4, and in other States more. Growers
will no doubt comment on the cost, but when
the crop return is worth from 2s. to 3s.
a pound, is a trial not worth while?
Growers in America reckon a shilling spent
on the right fertiliser mixture will return at
least twelve shillings in leaf. The correct
system is to apply half the dressing drilled
and harrowed in ten days prior to planting,
and the remainder between the rows of
plants a month later. Where planting has
already been done it may be too late for

DATE-GROWING IN THE U.S.A.
“E.P.8,” (California) : California dates,
introduced as “Desert Gold,” are now on
sale all over the country as an all-winter,
strictly-fresh fruit-item.’ “Picked fresh,
packed fresh, sold fresh, eaten fresh” is the
slogan. The co-operative marketing organi-
sation has had its distribution system going
only a few weeks; but results have been
very satisfactory. This season’s crop
approximates 5,000,0001 b. in the Coachella
Valley. Imperial Valley contx-ibutes some,
Southern Arizona has an output of
125,0001 b., and Death Valley about
100,0001 b. Dates have heretofore sold
mainly as a grocery product. The change
in policy and the complete reorganisation
of the industry’s methods came about as a
result of a nation-wide merchandising survey.
The potential consumption is estimated to
be many times more than sufficient to absorb
California date crops for years to come.
There should be a great scope for a similar
industry in Australia.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) What is the state of the tobacco-
growing industry in Australia? (2) Any
possibility of a young man making a* living
at it? (3) Minimum capital required ex-
clusive of the value of the land? (4) How
many acres needed? (5) Is the Penola dis-
trict of S. Aus. suitable, and what is the
value of land there or in other suitable dis-
tricts ?— 3498.
(1) The demand for good-quality Australian
tobacco is increasing. Of recent years there
has been a rapid advance in the area planted,
and leaf of the right quality is readily sale-
able at profitable rates. (2) On the right
soil and under the most favorable climatic
conditions it should be a profitable occu-
pation for an intelligent young man. (3)
Under usual conditions a tobacco-grower
commencing operations must maintain him-
self for at least 12 months before getting a
return; then he has to erect curing bai’n
and sheds, and secure tillage implements,
tools, etc. The minimum capital needed
would be £3OO. (4) One man would be
fully occupied in attending to from five to
six acres of crop. (5) Experienced growers
have harvested fair-quality tobacco in the
Penola district. The cost of land varies
according to the conditions, but a nominal
value is about £1 per acre.
Remedy for worms in a light horse? —3636.
Administer a drench consisting of of
turpentine in a pint of raw linseed oil. This
is given pi-eferably in the morning, after
having starved the horse from the previous
afternoon. The horse should not be worked
for at least 24 hours after being drenched.
(1) How much capital would be . required
to start a co-operative bacon factory in
N.S.W. to handle up to 100 pigs per week?
(2) Cost of buildings and plant? (3) Work-
ing costs? —3151.
(1) £2OOO to £2500. (2) Buildings, £l5OO
to £2000; plant, £BOO to £l5OO. (3) £3O
to £4O per week.
How can I prevent gi-übs attacking Cape
gooseberries?— 34B6.
Depends on what sort of grubs you fear.
The corn-ear worm not infrequently attacks
Cape gooseberries, and there is no means
known of dealing with it.
Is it possible to make sugar, in crude
form, from sugar-beet on a farm?— 347o.
The factory method consists of extracting
the sugar fi-om the finely-sliced beet by
steam under pressure. The extract is then
purified and passed on to vacxium containers,
where the water is removed by boiling, leav-
ing the ci-ude sugar as ci-ystals and thick
syrup. This is again refined to the various
grades. It might be possible to design
simple appliances for this purpose, but on
a small scale it would not be profitable.
How to protect crops against infestation
by potato mould? —3664.
Hill the plants up while growing. When
harvesting spread out in a well-shaded, cool,
dry situation, and cover with dry sand or
soil in which a little burnt lime has been
mixed.
(1) Cause and symptoms of blossom-end
rot of tomatoes? (2) Preventive treatment?
—3599.
This disease makes its appearance at the
blossom-end of the fruit as a water-soaked
area, which later becomes brownish in
color, leathery and sunken. A greenish-
black fungus is generally found associated
with the condition, giving the affected area
a velvety appearance. During very hot
weather the roots may be unable to provide
moisture at the rate the plant requires
it; then the plant will withdraw mois-
ture from the fruit, causing a collapse
of the _ cells at the blossom-end. Where
there is a deficiency of soil moisture
or an irregular supply of water the
same result may be expected. After the
tissues have collapsed they may be invaded
by fungi and bacteria. The disease is more
likely to occur in plants growing in light,
sandy, non-retentive soils lacking in humus.
(2) Where possible the plants should receive
regular and judicious applications of water.
The water-holding capacity of . soils of a
light, sandy nature may be increased by the
addition of well-rotted stable or other
manure, and a mulch of any material will
reduce evaporation of soil moisture. Con-
tinual stirring of the surface of the soil will
aid in this direction. Forcing the plants with
large amounts of fertilisers is undesirable,
and should be avoided. Young plants shoxxld
be grown slowly and well hardened before
planting. As far as possible they should
be sheltered from hot winds.
How to preserve capers? —3662.
Watch the capers and. when they are fully
grown and juicy, pick them on a sunny day
so that there is no moisture on them. Wipe
clean, and pack into dry glass bottles or
jars. Cover with a mixture of white vine-
gar containing salt to each pint. Cork
the bottles, cover with greaseproof paper,
and seal with wax. Should be left for six
months before using.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Yam”: You can make your own split
links for mending chains quite easily from
bits of round iron. Taper the two ends, after
heating the iron, and bend it round the point
of the anvil till the two tapered parts lie
together. Old bolts and the round part of
a broken auger are first-class for this pur-
pose.
“Dai R.”: Cow-bails where fleas are
noticed should be sprayed at least once a
week. ? A pint of kerosene in a gallon of
water, (distributed by an ordinary house-
spray, is good; sheep dip and water (same
quantities) is another “safe and sure.”
“Cockyson”: When couch grass gets a
footing in a growing crop like sugar-cane,
the only thing to do is to dig it up by the
roots. When there is much rain about the
rooted-up grass should be bagged and car-
ried off the field to be burnt as soon as it is
dry enough.
“Gumblegubbin”: In large piggeries a
hospital sty has been found an excellent
means of preventing the spread of contagious
diseases when an outbreak occurs among
the herd. This is built some distance away
from other yards to safeguard the healthy
animals, apd the affected ones are quaran-
tined there until it is safe for them to come
in contact with other pigs. A simple disin-
fectant for sties is a solution of one part
carbolic acid to 50 parts of water.
“Rooraby”You can get good results by
setting snares on the beaten tracks made by
wallabies where saplings grow. Drive two
tall pegs in the ground, one each side of a
pad. In notches near the top fix a cross-
bar; then cut off the top of a sapling, bend
it over, fasten a length of tying wire to
the end and twist it round the crossbar.
Thus the end is formed into a loop large
enough to admit a wallaby’s head. When
the animal strikes it, the bar is jerked from
the notches, and the spring of the released
sapling tightens the wire and holds it. In
suitable places the looped wire can be set
by hanging it from the low limb of a tree.
“F.A.R.”: A handy bag-hook can be made
from an old pitchfork head. Prongs are
cut off, leaving enough to turn and form
an ordinary-sized hook. (If a wool-hook
is required, leave more prong to turn.) The
part where the handle is fitted is rounded
off on top and a small washer is riveted
down tightly to the handle- Any piece of
solid wood will- serve. This home-made de-
vice gives a good grip and doesn’t tear the
bags. •
“4BG”: You may be obliged to strain to
a splitty strainer. Have two ends on the
wire to be strained, and bring them both
through the hole in the strainer. Attach
the sti’aining fork to one, and strain the
wire. Then, without driving the plug
(which would be useless, and would further
damage the post), take the loose end and
tie round the post and back on to the
stx-ained wire. The end psed for strain-
ing can be tied round the other side of the
post.
“A.G.8.”: If you want lucerne for fowls
and find it hard to get a plot started, try your
luck with a load of soil from ground where
lucerne is grown successfully. Incorporate
it with your soil and sow the seed near the
surface in rows. Keep the soil between the
rows well cultivated, and every little while
work in a little hydrated lime; also, if you
can ari’ange drains, keep the roots moist.
Most unsuitable soils can be made to produce
good lucerne by following these directions.
“Dimon”: When mash of any sort is fed
to chickens in open troughs it is trampled
and fouled, and many of the chicks do not
get their share. To avoid that, put a
Y-shaped hood of galvanis£d-iron over the
trough, and cut round holes along each side
just large enough for the chicks to get their
heads in. The hpod should go right over
the trough and rest on the ground, the sides
from the edge of the trough down being
sti*aight. It can then be lifted off and
dropped on as required, and cannot be dis-
placed by chickens.
“Wilga”: Keep the floor of the fowl-house
and duck-house well sprinkled with sand or
sawdust, and the droppings will then be
much easier to clean out. If vermin are
present, dust the floor first with lime after
the place has been cleaned out.
“Hornby”: If the tractor tarpaulin is be-
coming holey and you can’t afford a new
one, save the pelfs of freshly-shorn killers
and; reinforce it with them, woolly side to
canvas. Spriiikle the woolly side with sheep
dip to combat insect pests, and paint the
skin side with sump oil or fat with a dash
of -sheep dip worked in. Ordinary binder
twine beeswaxed is best for the sewing. Such
a covering will last for years.
“The Breaker”: The sandhill country
about Birdsville (s.-w. Q.) and in the
north of Soxith Aus. has a bad name for eye
. diseases among horses; partial or total blind-
ness has been the result in many eases. If
taken in time, boracic powder blown into
the eyes by means of a paper-made funnel,
fine salt, powdered sugar, powdered blue-
stone, alum and vinegar have all been used
with success; but, in order to prevent re-
currence, it is imperative to get the animals
away on country where sandy conditions are
absent.
“Deekay”: An old method of estimating
crops per acre. Frame together four light
sticks exactly a foot square inside. Select
in the field a spot of fail-average yield, and
lower the frame square over as many heads
as it will enclose. Shell out these heads care-
fully and weigh the grain. The pi-oduct
will be somewhere about the 43,560 th part
of an acre’s produce.
“W.J.W.” : To make a screwdi-iver for in-
accessible .screws, straighten out two pieces
of clock spring each about |in. long; fit them
tightly together into a handle and curve the
free ends away from each other. When using
it, press the ends together and fit them into
the cut on the screw-head. Out-of-the-way
screws can then be inserted easily.
From Andrew McNeill, Railway-street,
Newmarket, Auckland:—
“The Mystery of Redwater” (B. 30/11/’32) is no
mystery in Maoriland. In certain districts in the
winter and spring dairy cows are subject to redwater
on grass pasture, on chou moellier and on turnips,
but the farmers'think nothing of it when they have
a remedy at hand. As a rule two doses of one
tablespoon each effect a cure. I would be pleased
to get in touch with someone interested in this
matter in the Australian districts mentioned.

Information Sought.
When did the first motor-car appear in
Australia ? —3749.
Records are not quite conclusive, but the
honor appears to belong to a steam-car,
constructed by 11. Thompson, of Artfiadale
(Vic.). This was exhibited at the Royal Agri-
cultural Show in Sydney, Easter, 1900. and
was subsequently driven back to Victoria,
via Albury. The first petrol-driven car im-
ported to Australia was a- Benz, brought
from Germany by a Melbourne co. and landed
in that city in March, 1900. This was
followed by a De Dion, imported from
France bv W. J. C. Elliott. 0 f Sydney, in
May. 1900.
While on the P. and O. Christmas tour to
Norfolk Island I noticed two islands very
close to that spot. Names, and arc they
inhabited ? —3735.
Phillip Island and Nepean Island. Both
are uninhabited.
(1 ) In a tennis match the first service—
a fault —strikes the netting and bounces
on the court while the second service is in
the air, interfering with the receiver. May
he claim a let? (2) During a rally the gal-
lery applauds and a player catches his
opponent’s return and appeals to the umpire
for a let on the ground that the applause
was disconcerting. Should his claim be
allowed? —3733.
(1) Yes. If the ball, however, came back
into court before the second service had been
delivered, the onus would be on the receiver
to remove it or have it removed. (2) No.
The player loses the stroke. The umpire
is the sole judge, and if he considers it
necessary he will call a let.
A spectator at a tennis match gets into
the way of a player, who fails to return the
ball. May the player claim a, let? —3620.
Yes, if in the umpire’s opinion he was
Obstructed by circumstances beyond his con-
trol. For instance, if the ropes of the seats
are allowed to be so near to the court that
a player is interfered with by them, the
point should not be played again, because
the ropes and seats form part of the arrange-
ments of the ground. If, however, a spec-
tator passes in front of those seats, _ or
places his chair nearer than the original
line, and so interferes with a player, the
point should be replayed.
(1) Outside literature, what did George
GrOte, the historian, do? (2) When was
his “History of Greece” published? (3)
With what success? —3614.
(1) Employed in his father’s bank at 16,
he studied the classics, economics and philo-
sophy, took to politics, with radical views,
and represented the City of London in Par-
liament 1832-41. He was one of the founders
of London Uni., and endowed the Chair of
Philosophy. (2) Conceived as early as 1822
the 12 vols. appeared at various times be-
tween 1846 and 1856. (3) It immediately
became the standard work.
(1) What are the general principles of
the hydrogenation process of producing oil
from coal? (2) Would the plant used for
electrostatically clearing tar from coal-gas
be suitable for scrubbing uncondensable gases,
to collect the naphtha which they carry?
(3) What temperature would be required to
cause spontaneous ignition of a mixture of
benzine vapor and air under a pressure of
25 1 b. per sq. inch ( the vapor and air being
in correct proportions t 0 make the mixture
explosive ) ? (4) What maximum air pres-
sure would be stood by a container made of
‘Aft. of 12 in. “inserted joint” wrought-iron
pipe, a round iron plate oxy-weldcd into each
end, and plates and pipe trails jin. thick at
a temperature of AoOdeg. (j.? —3529.
(1) Involves the chemical combination of
hydrogen with high boiling-point hydrocar-
bons, with tlie resultant formation of lower
boiling-point hydrocarbons. The hydrogen
is forced into combination by means of a
high pressure and a certain amount of heat.
Such combination is also aided by various
catalysts. (2). No. (3) 360 deg. C. for one
particular variety of commercial benzine.
(4) If the joints are as strong as the pipe
material the ultimate bursting pressure
would be about 5001 b. per sq. inch, and a
safe working pressure about 1501 b. per so
inch. “
(1) How do the people of Australia com-
pare with the people of England physically.
(2) What effect is the climate of Australia
likely to have on the people? (3) Any good
books on the subject? —3499.
(1) On the average they are taller and
heavier. (2) Too complex a question ; Aus-
tralia has so many varieties of climate.
(3) None that we can recall.
What forms does sabotage take, and what
is “ca' canny”? —3639.
Sabotage is a term used to denote organ-
ised hindrance by employees of their eui-
ployers’ purposes. It may involve the de-
struction of machinery or the tools of those
who take the place of strikers. A _ more
subtle form of sabotage, and one which is
more general, is that which causes delay in
the process of production. “Ca’ canny,
industrially, means working slowly, and is
sometimes associated with a meticulous
observance of rules which are normally
tacitly ignored.
For what qualities are Skye terriers
noted? What are the points of the type?
—3633.
They are courageous, keen for sport, good-
tempered, intelligent and excellent watch-
dogs. The modern type has a long head
with a powerful jaw. The skull should be
wide at the front of the brow, narrow be-
tween the ears and tapering towards the
muzzle; the eyes, dark and rather close;
the nose, black; the body, long and low; the
shoulders, broad;, the chest, deep; the legs,
short, straight and muscular; the feet, small.
The coat should be long and straight, with
a soft, woolly undercoat; the colors, dark
or light blue, or grey or fawn, with black
points. There are two varieties : the prick-
eared, in which the ears are erect, and the
drop-eared, in which they hang down at the
side of the head.
(1) Upon what principle does the mirror
galvanometer work? (2) What is it used
for? —3649.
(1) The moving system of the instrument
consists of a small mirror kept taut by a
fine metal wire held vertically. A thin beam
of light from a small lamp is directed on
this mirror and reflected on to a divided scale
placed several feet from the mirror. When
a minute current of electricity flows through
the instrument, the mirror is deflected from
its normal position, causing the light beam
to move along the scale. (2) For measuring
extremely weak electrical currents.
(1) When, where and by whom were the
first motion pictures displayed in Sydney?
(2) What was tlie. first Sydney theatre de-
voted entirely to motion pictures, and when
did it open? —3673.
(1) By Carl Hertz, the conjuror, at the
oiu Tivoli, on September 19, 1896. The sub-
jects included a view of the traffic crossing
Westminster Bridge, London, a burlesque
of “Trilby” and a round of a boxing match.
(2) The Salon Lumifere, in Pitt-street,
almost opposite the. Lyceum Theatre. There
were 12 pictures to a programme and eight
sessions daily. It opened a few days after
Hertz’s arrival at the Tivoli.
(1) Have the abos. ever used the beans
of the Moreton Bay chestnut as a food, and,
if so, were they eaten raw or cooked? (2)
Are the beans poisonous? (3) Is the timber
of the tree of any use? —3678.
(1) Yes; they prepared them by steeping
them in water from eight to ten days, dry-
ing them in the sun, roasting on hot stones
and pounding into a coarse meal. When re-
quired for use the meal was mixed with
water, made into a thin cake and baked.
(2) They are suspected of poisoning stock,
but no poisonous property has been isolated;
it is suggested that any injury suffered by
stock from eating them lia§ been due to
their indigestibility. (3) The timber is
soft, fine-grained and takes a good polish,
but is not very durable. It is used for
cabinet work.
What is the strength of the Japanese
Army? —36Bl.
The peace strength is 276,000 men, and
the total force which could be placed in
the field is probably over 2,000,099. The
air force has a strength of 838 ’planes and
6,944 men, and is being greatly increased.
How can I identify the regent-bird? —
3679.
It is one of the bower-birds and the sole
member of its genus ( Sericulus cliryso-
cephalus). The male is velvety black, with
head, neck and back and some of tlie wing-
feathers a rich orange-yellow. The female
is brown above, with a whitish head and
underparts, and black patches on the head
and throat. This species feeds on insects,
berries and fruits; its call is a single whistle.
The nest is a slender structure, usually
placed in a bunch of trailing creepers; the
eggs are yellowish, with blotches of brown
and grey and fine stripes and scrawls of
reddish-brown. The bower is like that of
the satin-bird, but smaller and sometimes
without any platform of sticks. It is deco-
rated chiefly with berries, leaves and snail-
shells.
What was the “Leg-iron Act” and did it
have any adverse influence on the political
career of C. G. Wade? —3743.
It was an amendment of the N.S.W.
Industrial Disputes Act (1908), introduced
by Charles Gregory Wade. It was passed
with the intent of making the law against
strikes and lock-outs more effective. Some
constables, having under arrest a number
of union officials charged until inciting a
strike, put leg-irons on their prisoners when
escorting them to the lock-up. Tlie statute
was dubbed “The Leg-iron Act” by the
LaboriUs, and the affair helped their party
to win power at the election two year's later.
I am taking a position at Vila, in the New
Hebrides, and will be accompanied there by
my wife and small child. (1) Is it an
unhealthy place? (2) What are the chief
diseases which occur among Europeans there?
—3738. :
(1) One of the chief enemies of good
health in Vila is the scarcity of green vege-
tables and good-quality fresh food. As a
general rule, it is desirable that a visit be
taken to a temperate climate every two or
three years, especially in the case of
women and children. (2) Malaria, dysen-
tery, and blackwater fever.
(1) What arc the amounts for which Aus-
tralian coins are legal tender in Australia?
(2) Are English sovereighs legal tender in
Australia? —3745.
(1) Gold coins are legal tender to any
amount, silver for an amount not exceed-
ing forty shillings, and bronze up to one
shilling. (2) Yes.
What is lynch law, and how did the
phrase originate? —37s3.
A phrase denoting mob vengeance with-
out form of law on a person suspected of
having committed a crime, now mainly
associated with the hanging hr burning of
negroes in the United States for assaults on
white women. The origin of the term is vari-
ously connected with the name of Colonel
Lynch, who illegally whipped Tory conspira-
tors in 1780; and with that of James Lynch
Fitz-Stevens, mayor of Galway who in 1493
tried his son for murder and, when pre-
vented from publicly executing him, hanged
him from the window of his own house. ;
In the talkie “Kongo” mention is made of
“Ju-Ju.” What does it mean? —3747.
It is a term used by the Africans of the
Guinea Coast to denote any kind of fetish.
It may have been adopted from the French
joujou, a toy, or corrupted from the Man-
dingo gru-gru , a charm. The word, besides
denoting the shrine, idol or charm in which a
spirit was supposed to dwell, was applied
to the spirit itself, and hence loosely to
witchcraft, savage rites and customs charac-
teristic of the negroes. The “long Ju-Ju”
of the Nigerian Aros was a sacred shrine
where human beings were sacrificed until
the British in tori ored (1901-02). De
Candi’s “Ju-Ju Laws and) Customs” is a
good book on the subject.
What are blue fish ? —3077.
They are a brightly-colored species, plen-
tiful at Lord Howe Island, and occasionally
captured on the coast near Sydney, where
a headland (Bluefish Point) has been named
after it. Though closely related to the
common blaekfish of N. S. Wales—which, like
various allied species, is herbivorous —the
bluefish is carnivorous, and readily takes a
hook baited with fish or with a large white
grub (the larva of a longicOrn beetle) found
in decaying wood. Its flesh is superior to
that of its weed-eating relatives, and half-
grown examples (“pannies”) are choice
table-fishes. It attains a length of about
two feet and is bright blue in color when
first hooked, with golden spots on the sides;
it changes to a dull leaden color a few
minutes after capture. Semi-albino speci-
mens are sometimes caught which are uni-
formly yellow.

1692. (2) There’s no choice. Swiss pine
for bellies or fronts and European maple
for backs, ribs and scrolls have been used
by the bdst violin makers for over 300 years.
(3) It is believed that age mellows the tone.
(4) Straight-grained wood is the best for
bellies or fronts. Figured maple is more
in demand for backs and ribs, but is not
better in tone than some plain maple. (5)
Numerous tests have been made with old and
new violins. At a big contest some years
ago a new violin was judged superior to
a fine old one. (6) Watts, Ltd., 72-75 Fen-

Composition and properties of luminous
paints f—3751.
Many substances with the power of lumin-
escence have been incorporated in -paint.
Such paints do not give off enough light to
illuminate their surroundings, but serve to
render the objects coated , with them visible
in the dark by the phosphorescent glow.
The substances used are the sulphides of
calcium, barium and strontium, prepared by
the reduction of the sulphate with carbon.
The earliest luminous paint was “Bologna
phosphorus,” the sulphide of barium; Bal-
main’s luminous paint is another mixed sul-
phide preparation. The essential point about
these substances it that they lose the property
unless exposed periodically to sunlight or
other strong actinic rays. By mixing an
ordinary luminous paint with a radioactive
substance such as mesothorium, a luminous
paint is„ produced that does not need to lie
exposed to light. Such compositions are
largely - used fob illuminating watch, and
clock dials.

MEN AMONG
PEARLS
By
H. Drake-Brochman
Synopsis : Christopher Kent, a young
English aristocrat, educated at Oxford,
who has been turned down by his
cousin Lettice on account of his
poverty, comes to the Nor'-West
pearling grounds hoping to make
quick money and return to her. While
he is in Broome (to which he has
gone to give evidence about an attack
made on Horton, a pearler, by a
colored “boy") June Goer, daughter
of another pearler, arrives from Mel-
bourne, where she has been living,
and is ; greatly interested in Chris.
She tries to find, out something about
him from “Uncle Monty” (Mr. Mont-
gomery), an old friend. Young Peter
Fordyce, a wealthy pearler, is greatly
interested in June. June makes a
friend of Queenie, a girl of her own
age, about whom there is some mys-
tery,. Chris’s boat stays out over
Christmas, but at last he comes in
for the Lay-up. June is delighted
with the bustle and movement.
CHAPTER VIII ( Continued).
THE girl saw a great deal of Christopher
Kent that Lay-up. Three times a day
at hotel meals, to begin with, and often
when he dropped in to lounge on the big
shady verandah at Goer’s bungalow, with its
soothing mass of green swinging baskets
and ferns. At first she was delighted; then
she began to notice he came only with
Peter. Better for June had she realised it
was Peter who brought him—brought him
so often that at last Chris was driven to
protest, saying Fordyce must really learn
to paddle his own canoe. But Peter knew
his Broome; he meant to see as much of
June as ever he could without her father’s
noisy presence. And he also knew his
Goer; if the Captain found him too often
alone on that verandah with his daughter,
the privilege of coming when he liked might
soon cease to be his.
In January June was nineteen. She gave
a birthday party Nineteen, thought Chris,
when gaily she invited him—a mere babe!
He smiled down on her and said he would
be delighted, and then went away to buy
the largest box of chocolates he could find
in Chinatown. And June tried to read into
his polite attentions the same awareness
she sensed in Peter. But Chris was doing
no more than he did for any woman to
whose house he went: he liked to come
with Fordyce, to sit and watch the girl
whilst they talked, for ever tracing some
new resemblance to Lettice.
June, determined to make her party a
tremendous success in spite of the weather,
invited a varied assortment, with ages
ranging from sixteen to well past sixty. She
spent hours persuading Mr. Montgomery
to come, but all the satisfaction she re-
ceived was an aggravating “We’ll see.”
The older folks were rather bored, until
rumor declared that June had prevailed
upon her father to engage Leo for the
evening. They continued to talk as -if
birthday parties were “altogether too much
of a good thing”; but each asked the other
just what did he make of Leo—could there
be anything in it? The younger ones were
frankly delighted; at least the girls were,
although most of the young men chose to
ape their elders.
it Leo—Professor Theodore Leo—had
arrived, unannounced, from Singapore, with
a variety of strange-looking packages. He
had dumped them at the Oriental Hotel,
walked into the bar, ordered drinks all
round and immediately established himself
as the centre of interest, to the complete
dethronement of shell and divers and a
flash new barmaid from Perth. Leo inti-
mated that he was a Professor of the Occult
Sciences. He produced cards and begged
Captain Goer, who chanced to be standing
beside him, to pull one from the pack.
Goer did so, smiling, and Leo’s quick eyes,
ranging the room, lit on Major Challenge
seated afar off and sneering,' Politely,
Challenge was requested to tell the crowded
bar which card Goer held in his hand. He
refused. Leo insisted. “Go to Hell,”
shouted the Major—“ten of hearts, blast
you!” The ten of hearts it was.
Most of the men went home wondering,
even though they laughed-. Challenge
stalked out in a blind rage. The impudence
of the creature! But he confessed to Monty
that it scared him. “Dammit, man,” he
stuttered, “I couldn’t help it. In front of
all those fellers, too! Ten of hearts. It
just came into my head and out of my
mouth like a bubbly cork popping off.
What do you make of that? Hypnotism,
I call it. Infernal cheek! I don’t like it.”
Mr. Montgomery made little of it beyond
enjoying the idea of Major Challenge be-
ing used by a travelling conjuror. But it
was small wonder that with a few more
tricks and a keen display of second sight
in the matter of Smith’s lost cuff-links,
which were discovered, on the Professor’s
advice, in the possession of the laundry man,
Leo accumulated prestige rapidly. Of
course the man was only a mountebank
but one never could tell—had you heard
what he told Jack? Everyone asked every-
one else if they meant to go to the fellow’s
show, billed for the following week. And
so June’s guests arrived in a pleasant state
of anticipation, wondering if it were true
that Leo was to be there, hoping, pleased
at the prospect of having forced upon them
an acquaintance they were all eager to
make, if loth to seek.
June, framed by a dancing host of
Japanese lanterns, flew from one end of
the verandah to the other, called orders
to the two house gins giggling in clean
print frocks, fiddled with a cushion or a
flower, insisted that once again the Captain
should be sure the drinks were cold enough,
and that the supper, ordered from the
woman who ran the squash-shop in China-
town, was all that: could.be desired. . Cool
as a cucumber she looked, grumbled her
father, and the evening not fit for a black-
fellow ! He’d a damned good mind to get
into a pair of bathers. Whereat June
laughed. Six months earlier she would have
been alarmed, but now she knew Goer was
altogether too pleased with his newly-
acquired mess-jacket to dream of discard-
ing it. It was Christopher Kent who had
set the fashion for those stupid little white
Eton coats; but although June declared the
men all looked like stewards in them, she
had to admit they were much cooler than
tails or dinner-jacket, in which, Monty re-
minded her,' the men might equally well be
said to resemble waiters. Women, he
twinkled, were the only snobs where dress
was concerned. And so, as he always left
his own glad rags at his club in Melbourne,
he couldn’t come to the - party. “As if I
care!” protested June. “Uncle Monty, I
think you are all mad to wear such hot
things; tennis clothes would be better.”
“June, I’m surprised at you,” retorted
Monty. “Anything so injra dig in Broome!
I thought you were having all the best
people? I wouldn’t dream of coming now!
I’m surprised you asked me.”
“Uncle Monty, you ate horrid! Why
won’t you come?”
“Well, if you must have the truth, be-
cause I know you have asked the Tweedies
and Mrs. Tweedie doesn’t think I am nice
to know. And I’m not talking to Smith
just now, arid Chris will be there and I
won’t play second fiddle.”
Exasperated, June cried: “Tell me why!
Don’t talk nonsense all the time. I’ll be
so disappointed.” She laid a hand on his
sleeve.
Monty looked down from his great height
and replied, so solemnly that June was
almost taken in: “Because I might get
drunk.”
But his blood warmed: it was good to be
wanted! Good to feel the child meant all
she said—or thought she did. But she
wouldn’t worry about him when the night
came, and he -was not going to mix him-
self up with the crowd and talk sweet no-
things, even for June. A pipe on the
verandah and all the news in the morning
would be his share of the party.
June gave up trying to coax him and
went home, almost unhappy. She had been
so sure he would come. Their friendship
had travelled swiftly since that morning in
the shell-sheds. And now to find she could
not move him when she had been so certain
of her power —that hurt. It made a tiny
stain on the glittering mantle of her enjoy-
ment. But, as Monty had guessed would
happen, he was forgotten when she greeted
Christopher Kent, looked into his smiling
eyes and took from his hands an enormous
box of sweets.
Christopher was an early arrival. He
found June talking to the Smiths; he
stepped forward to join in the conversa-
tion, prepared to let bygones be bygones.
Immediately Smith turned ostentatiously
aside and began to study the latest Bulle-
tin which had been left on one of
the cane chairs. His wife dutifully looked
at her rings. Absurd, thought Chris, but
rather than embarrass June, he. strolled off
to join Goer, engaged at the far end of
the verandah in talking- to Horton, who
at the moment, was at daggers-drawn- with
but Captain Brittle decorated the assembly
complete in his dress-coat and diamond
studs, if still without a collar. And, wonder
of wonders, with him had come Angelina!
Mrs. Captain Brittle had not been to a
party for j'ears. Now she sat mopping her
face with one of 8.8.’s large silk handker-
chiefs, her truly magnificent diamonds
gleaming on an old-fashioned pouter-pigeon
bosom, her violent red locks sprinkled with
a lavish dressing of cheap paste clasps.
Chris sauntered across to talk to her.
“Ah, dearie,” she greeted him. “Could you
just ask Goer to get me a spot? June
would have me come, the dartin’, and me
auld waist is not that in love with a corset.”
Chris went in search of the drink, won-
dering what she would say next. He’d
heard plenty of tales: Angelina’s sayings
were notorious. Half this push didn’t con-
descend to bother about the old thing.
All the same, he hoped she wouldn’t ask
for too many spots, or if she did, that her
husband would take her home before any
damage was done. Chris looked after her
all evening.
There was no pretence about Angelina;
and this Lay-up, knowing folks a little
better, hearing a little more, he had begun
to experience a faint contempt for the airs
some of the women put on. Rotten bad
form, he thought, and worse than that—
at least for Chris, who read hypocrisy into
what was frequently no more than a harm-
less enough game of grown-up make-believe.
People danced a little; the heat of the
night closed round them like a wet towel,
wrapping their bodies together, till dancing
became as Goer declared in his loud voice,
to June’s horror, “a case of mingling
sweats.” As time passed the guests grew
restless: was the rumor about the conjuror
no more than a “spinifex wire?” An almost
audible sigh of satisfaction issued from a
dozen lips when the Captain vanished down
the steps into the moonlight and returned
with the Professor in his wake.
“Ladies and gentlemen,” boomed Goer.
“Allow me to present Professor Theodore
Leo, who is the er What the devil
are you, man?”
“Master of the Occult Sciences, World’s
Greatest Hypnotist, King of Magicians. At
your service”—Leo finished for him, bowing
elegantly from the waist, smiling a little.
The women, who had not, of course, seen
him in the bars, were disappointed. He
looked so ordinary! Tall, slim, slightly
bald, banal as any other man in a dress-
suit. Or were his eyes unusual?
But the men, who had seen him at work,
crowded round and began to ask questions.
“Time, gentlemen, please,” pleaded the
conjuror. A decent voice, thought Chris,
and w r ondered what Leo’s real name might
be.
“I am here,” went on the Professor, “to
—ah—-offer a little amusement. And, if
you will allow me to say so, give you some-
thing that is more than an entertainment.”
“Be careful what you say, Prof.,” inter-
rupted Goer jocularly. “We don’t want
any fights!”
Leo cast an appraising eye round the
assembly, picked up Mrs. Tweedie’s soulful
glance and watched her brindle, as became
the most beautiful woman in Broome when
meeting a strange man, even if he were
only a paid entertainer. He smiled be-
nignly.
“I will be the very soul of discretion,”
he murmured, “but of course I cannot help
the words which come from my lips, the
spirit moves me and”
He waved a hand, implying that he really
could not be held responsible if, inadvert-
ently, he blurted forth their hearts’ secrets.
June felt a shiver run down her spine.
Of course it was all nonsense. But what
fun!
Leo began with a few card tricks, suffi-
ciently arresting to convince his audience
that here was something out of the ordi-
nary. Leo had pursued many vocations
before he became a Master of the Occult;
you may think as you like, on that subject,
but all who watched him at June’s party,
where he had no chance of having accom-
plices, were soon convinced he was pos-
sessed of some uncanny power.
When he felt the atmosphere had been
prepared, having first reminded them he
had only been asked by Captain Goer to
“give a few T tricks,” he very generously
declared himself willing to hold any hand
and—no, not tell any fortunes, but see
what physic reaction he • received; unfold
characters; possibly, if he were lucky,
catch a glimpse of the future.
Goer pushed everyone into a chair. Peter
Fordyce swung a leg over the arm of June’s.
The men looked sheepish, the women gave
little laughs, each one secretly pondering
it she would refuse, knowing ghe would not,
wishing Goer had arranged for private
searicps?—so much more satisfactory-!.
Smith over some
equally futile mat-
ter. Chris laughed.
And Goer said:
“Hullo, hullo, come
and have a drink.”
But presently a
crowd was there
and everything
going well.
Chris looked
round and decided
that June really
had done marvels.
To be sure, Monty
was missing and so
was Peter’s mother,
Goer was first. The Professor took the
Captain’s hand and looked into his face.
Next he covered his own eyes with his
free hand and the voice of the seer, a
totally different voice, fell into a sudden
silence, like a pebble into a pool: “You
are impatient. No, no, imperious. A law
unto yourself. You rule men—and women.
You take what you want. You had a
struggle early in your life, but money
comes easily to you now. You could rule.
You should find a wider sphere for your
talents—politics, perhaps. You once lost
someone very close to you through your
—er—your own fault. Beware lest
again”.... The protecting hand dropped.
Leo opened his eyes as one awakening.
Goer went red in the face; but, fortunately,
the reference to politics pleased him. Leo
said vaguely that he hoped nothing was
wrong—he only said what was forced from
h-im. Goer handed him rather abruptly to
Mrs. Tweedie.
“Ah,” murmured the Seer, “this hand
is born to rule. Hearts. Men’s hearts—
many are the lips that have been pressed
to it in allegiance. The owner is aware of
her powers, but should always remember
that kind hearts are more than coronets.
She was once very interested in music—
Singing, I think. In public. A concert
voice. She might have been a second
Melba but for that fatal charm. But she
should beware of flatterers”
“Wonderful!” sighed the most beautiful
woman in Broome. But she made a coy
gesture of depreciation, and glanced across
to see how her husband was taking it.
Hand after outstretched hand Leo lifted,
lightly held. But Queenie’s slim respon-
sive fingers were lightly pressed. “You can
make your future what you will,” he told
her. “You love dress and jewels and—er
—life. Aou won’t spend all your days in
Broome. I can see an unfortunate affair
of the heart—but you do not seem to be
the one most hurt. I think you are too
self-possessed to let your heart spoil the
world for you. Everything will come right
in the end, because of your—er—joie-de-
vivre”....
Queenie’s little giggle ran round the silent
verandah. The man was positively un-
canny, several of the women said. Earlier
in the evening some of them had discussed
the advisability of warning June. It was
too bad of Goer; but the man was imper-
vious to hints, or perhaps, as one more
leniently suggested, he really was unaware
of the bad name Queenie’s flighty behavior
was fast earning for her. The others smiled
sarcastically at that, and more than one
lady whose own past might not have pre-
sented a virgin sheet commented disparag-
ingly on these modern flappers.
Mr. Montgomery would have found
amusement enough for a week had he
chanced to overhear.
But Leo was standing beside June now,
her hand in his, her eager blue eyes light-
ing a rapt face. “You have a happy
nature,” he told her softly. “You take
pleasure in giving pleasure to others. But
you should be careful not to be taken in.
Life is not always a.s wonderful as we are
inclined to think. It seems to me that
women come very little into your life—
your affections are mainly held by the
opposite sex.” Peter stopped to whisper
banteringly in her ear: “Oh, June!” And
Leo went on: “I see two men very close
to you.” Peter murmured again, not car-
ing if the other guests stared: “Here’s one.”
June flashed him a look of reproach; it was
too bad of him to spoil her fortune with
his aggravating a.nd absurd interruptions!
“But,” warned Leo, “be very, very careful.
I can foresee sorrow. Another man-—not
either of those. You will have a choice to
make”....
What things to tell her! And how she
w'ould be teased—and yet that part about
men was true enough. There was Daddy
and the boys and Uncle Monty—and—and
Mr. Kent, and of course, Peter, and the
rest. Auntie Miriam she loved dearly, but
then she already belonged to the past, to
a little schoolgirl, not a sophisticated young
woman of nineteen, with a pearling town
for background! Her school friends—dears,
but also belonging to the past. And
Queenie? Well, a good friend, but not the
sort one told one’s dreams to! And a girl
couldn’t be expected to spend her time
with married women. Peter’s mother, now.
But she was too wrapped up in Peter. She
wished Leo hadn’t talked about sorrow. As
if it mattered! It was only fun—what was
he saying to Peter?
Peter Fordyce was told he had been born
to command, not hearts, like Mrs. Tweedie,
but men. He might not find himself so
successful with the fair sex, but he was
very much in love with a fair girl. And
yet he appeared to be born under a lucky
star. It seemed as if he would Lave to
persevere if he wished to achieve his
desires.
Everyone laughed at Peter, who flushed
a little, but retorted by telling Leo he
was no sort of a magician, because he
already had a brown-eyed wife and tw r o
babies in Perth. Imperturbably Leo asked
if that would in any way prevent him from
being in love with a fair lady? “Didn t
I say you’d have to persevere?” he de-
manded. And everyone laughed so much
that Fordyce jumped up, and, taking Leo
by the shoulders, thrust him upon Kent,
who was trying to escape.
“Here’s the man for you,” he shouted.
“He must have all sorts of a lurid past.
At him," Professor!”

Rather than make himself conspicuous,
Christopher was obliged to yield his hand,
submit his face to an intent scrutiny, and
listen to his fortune.
“You have not always lived this kind of
life,” droned Leo. “I see here some con-
nection with people in an exalted position.
But you wei’e unfortunate. Business? No,
I do not think so. It was not a business
failure which brought you here—it must
have been an affair of the heart. You
could find happiness, but you are inclined
to expect too much of others. You neither
alter your opinions nor change your affec-
tions readily. You have had many dis-
appointments, but—l cannot tell. You
are too contradictory. I do not see that
you will make much of life—but I think
you could”
The fellow was really clever, thought
Chris, wiping his hand on his handkerchief.
Contradictory—a dreamer, eh? That was
rot, of coui’se, but the rest was right enough.
As if all that nonsense about finding hap-
piness depended on himself! It jolly
well depended on finding a big pearl and
getting back to Lettice.
The fortune-telling was over. The guests
split into groups, chattering, discussing,
raggiiig each other. June’s idea was voted
a tremendous success: the Professor really
was uncanny. Individuals disclaimed given
characters, only to be assured by the others
how astonishingly • correct they were—there
was no nonsense about the man, he didn’t
say just what he thought you’d like, but
the truth. Clever!
Of course Leo was clever. His audience
forgot he had spent a week round the
pubs, where a man could hear all the past
history, true, near-true, and entirely fic-
tional, of evexyone in Broome, and that
faces were like books to a sharp chap who
had been three times round the world as a
student of human nature in search of a
livelihood.
CHAPTER IX.
Farce.
Cable Beach lay glistening in the light
of, a setting moon; swept hard and flat
by the receding tide, it was a silvery no
man’s land between the warm red sand-
hills and the dim waves, curling with an
eerie sob, far out and mysterious. The
moon was dipping to the horizon, fading,
strange as only the moon can be at three
o'clock in the morning. Miles away the
eye of the lighthouse on the rocks at
Entrance Point, guiding the way into
Roebuck Bay beyond, bi*avely winked and
twinkled—a solitaiy flash of reality in a
phantom world. Then into the shadowy
silence, down on to the wet sand so cobl to
tired feet, poured car-loads of revellei’s,
laughing, shrieking, chasing each other into
the sobbing sea.
June’s party had grown riotous. The
night seemed to have gathered heat a.s it
progressed, and Goer had not been at all
close with the drinks. The majority of the
older guests departed after June’s health
had been toasted for the third time, but,
Goer hated to end a good thing, and the
younger people were encouraged, exhorted
almost, to “keep their tails up.” But by
three o’clock even the Captain began to
show signs of giving in. He had changed
his collar four times already; he had no
intention of changing it again. Instead, he
appeared, as he had threatened, in his
bathers, and was greeted with cries of
“Bright idea!” from eveiybody, including
June. A scramble for bathers. Cars chug-
ging round the sleeping town to different
houses, and then a mad rush along the
rough track through the pindan, with shrieks
from the girls as the vehicles swerved and
bumped like charging animals.
June was first across the sand, a light
wraith in blue bathers whose color was
stolen by the moon. The others pushed
close on her heels, but she sped on; she
wanted most desperately to be first—and
alone—into that mysterious sea wherein the
phosphorus glittered, beckoned, vanished,
gleamed anew. She heard Peter Fordyce
pursuing; the next moment he sprang past,
his long lithe body poised for a dive which
took him clean into the surf.
He rose, shook the water from his eyes
and called to her: “Come on, it’s heaven.”
But June lingei-ed on the edge with the
warm water caressing her toes. The spell
was broken. She let them all splash past,
watched her father pick Queenie up in his
great haiiy arms and fling her into the foam.
Why was she being so silly? Why had
it seemed so important that she should be
first in?
Fordyce caught her as she came up from
her plunge. That was why, she thought
wildly: she had known Peter would do that;
and she hadn’t wanted him to! She
splashed and wriggled, and she imagined,
although she could not be certain, that he
kissed her between the shoulder blades. He
hadn’t any right to! Not that June thought
anything of a kiss or two—Peter had stolen
oixe before now, but he had changed lately.
She had felt for some time that he wanted
to hold her fast, as he was doing now, and,
well, she just didn’t like it! Queenie, on
the other hand, seemed rather to enjoy that
sort of thing—she was enjoying it now, lost
in the flying spray and illusive night. June
could hear her calling out and giggling.
But she herself wriggled free and splashed
water into Peter’s grey eyes, bright with a
passion it was well she could not see, and
slipped from his hands.
Aou little witch,” he said as she flung
through the breakers at his side. “You look
like Venus in the foam. 1”.... A cascade
of water drowned the words on his lips.
June dived away among the others. Peter
was getting too serious, she thought. Other
men she didn’t mind, but there was some-
thing about Peter which frightened her—
or was it something in herself? She didn’t
know—only the fact remained that she
didn’t want Peter.
Why was Mr. Kent—Chris—if only he
hadn’t gone home! If only he had spoken
those flattiering words! Her eyes grew
suddenly hot. A wonderful birthday she’d
had. Yet Uncle Monty’s refusal still
rankled, and Chris had gone home to bed
rather than come out to the beach. Sud-
denly June felt like a gay little balloon
who had just disco vexed a pin-prick in his
bright skin through which he could hear
the whistle of escaping life. What ridiculous
thoughts! Why on earth should she bother
about Mr. Kent—Chris? She was nineteen;
that lightening of the sky heralded the dawn
of another year for her. The past one had
been glorious; what reason was there for
her to feel this tremor of uncertainty?
Life was marvellous.
Not even to herself would June admit
that, had Christopher Kent been standing
beside her, the dawn would have looked
more lovely.
Later in the week the air-mail brought a
letter to Kent from England. A nice,
cousinly letter from Lettice. But to Chris,
who was feeling rather glum over things
in general and the old Captain’s behavior
in particular, it came like a whisper of
insurrection. He read into its New Year
wishes, its so gaily expressed hopes that soon
he would be coming home with cartloads
of pearls, a faint promise.
So far he and she had exchanged no
word since that ghastly afternoon more
than five years before. She must have heard
about the pearling, he thought, from
Gutteridge, with whom he had come out to
Australia as aide. Gutteridge would be in
England again by now, and sure to run across
her. And she had taken the trouble to
write—she wanted to be friends again!
Deep within him stirred hope that perhaps
Lettice had found it no easier than he had
—that she could not forget,
A man less eager to be reassured might
have wondered why she took such pains
to tell him, between cinema news and
gossip about friends, that she had at long
last met Dick Attenborough—wasn’t it
strange that they had never met before?—
and how, quite definitely, he was a very
decent fellow. But for a week Chris walked
from the Buccaneer Arms to Chinatown on
air; and June, sensing a change in him,
glowed and sparkled herself. So brilliantly
alive she grew that, when Kent asked if
she would care to go to Professor Leo’s
show, Peter Fordyce told her it really
wasn’t fair to be so vivacious in the Lay-
up, when a man’s brain was melted and
unable to deal with her. And Uncle Monty
was driven to ask what her dope might be,
although he had an unpleasant fear that
he could guess.
(To be continued next week.)
The Blind Cobbler and the Seagulls.
I was weary of the same bird shouting;
I was weary of the summer showers
Cluttering the same old spouting,
Weary of the scent of flowers,
Violets, and the distant hint
Of briar-rose and garden mint,
And the sound of fir-trees dipping
Ensigns to the lordly breeze.
So I raised my rheumy, knees,
And I sought the foreign shipping
Berthed along the waterfront,
With my hand upon the shoulder
Of my ’prentice, for we hunt
In couples with our Gorgon’s eye
Serving for headlight, he and I.
So I left Tom Tiddler’s ground,
Where the grass is long and lush,
Where I hammer to the sound
Of the blackbird and the thrush.
So we did the blind’s man’s hobble
Through the roaring thoroughfares,
Till we came by greasy cobble
To a flight of wooden stairs.
And suddenly my phlegm was hit
By the abounding brine that swamped
All my ears and mouth, and bit
On my tongue. My fingers romped,
And my idle palms were moist
For thinking on the freight they hoist
So perilously in the air,
As it were some poor lad swinging
In expiation, and my hair
Was stirred to hear the seagulls singing.
Singing? I think the noise they make
Would cause a inother’s heart to break;
And yet I thought of lovely things,
Of little children’s heads and wings
That old-man Reynolds once did limn
On canvas—bless the name of him!
I can remember one child stared
Straight out of eyes like dawns in June,
And every child was golden-haired.
A bird-like profile one. What tune
I wonder is it that God sings
When He’s a-making heads and wings?
Oh, could we think on wings and heads
We’d sleep the purer in our beds.
But as the seagulls screamed on high
I thought of anthropophagi,
With hideous pates not set on wings
But ’twixt humped shoulders: and the stings
That Prosper laid on Caliban,
And all the dead who lie along
The sultry road to Ispahan.
And listening to the seagulls’ song,
I said, “God help us! Can it be
I left my garden for the sea?”

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Unregistered racing in the Sydney metro-
politan area is a thing of the past. Re-
cently the Victoria Park club applied to
the A.J.C. for registration, and when this
was granted the Kensington, Rosebery
and Ascot clubs also asked success-
fully for admittance to the fold. Opposi-
tion was shown by Gosford and Men-
angle, which are likely to suffer by the
change, and Rosehill, Moorefield and Canter-
bury Park also objected unavailingly. Officials
of the transferring clubs will not be dis-
turbed, while trainers and jockeys regis-
tered with the Associated Racing Clubs
will be deemed as registered with the
A.J.C. to the end of the current season.
L. G. Fraser has been appointed chair-
man of the stipes for the newly-registered
clubs, the others being Messrs. Turner and
Donohue. Pony races, any distance, may be
included in the programmes of the ex-A.R.C.
clubs, but all other races for three-year-olds
and upwards will be at least six furlongs,
except that at Kensington the minimum will
be 54 furlongs.
* * * *
Sydney people had a foretaste at Canter-
bury Park of what six-furlong races will be
like in the subbubs with the pony clubs
under the A.J.C. banner. Even without
ponies there were 20 starters in the Flying
Handicap, and a painful amount of crowd-
ing and jostling was seen. Backers de-
clared for Red Shadow (7 to 2), who had
the position nearest the rails; Curtius (6
to 1) was next choice; you could get 10 to
1 bar these two. Neither figured in the
finish, but no horse could be blamed for a
failure in that packed field. Promptitude
(12 to 1) won cleverly from Hampton
Plane (10 to 1) and Orpah (15 to 1) in the
good time of lmin. 13Jscc. He likes the
course, but some of those who would have
supported him in other circumstances lost
their enthusiasm when they saw that James
Bert: “cheerio 1"
Gert *loodle.-oo! ”
Bert " Goo - e>ye ! "
GERT'/DWTIN ! ITS GOT ANOTHER FIT OF
INFER.IORITV COMPLEX''
would have to get him away from No. 18
position; he is generally a slow starter.
Labor Girl was fourth, not a blanket’s length
from the winner.
Gippsland (The Verderer—Golden Lily)
ran second in a 13-furlong race at Randwick
in the winter, and, remembering that, punters
picked him to beat the poor lot he had to
meet in the Canterbury Handicap, sending
him out at threes; The favorite accomplished
liis task easily, and left the 11 furlongs
behind in 2min. 23sec.; Australian Belle
(6 to 1) and Nagrada (8 to 1) followed
him home, but never looked like troubling
him. Lovely Balloon and Rogerson were
among the starters; both seem to have lost
tneir form. Gippsland and Hampton Plane
are trained at Newcastle by Murray. A
useful pair.
Jack King, for whom Miss Nottava lias
done so well lately, picked up a couple of
races with horses racing in his own colors;
Clever Fox (4 to 1) in the Nursery Handi-
cap, and Cairbar (7 to 1) in a division of
the Maiden Welter—there were three,
James rode both, so this Newcastle jockey
had an excellent day. Cairbar (Tippler—
Clair Obscure) is a brother to Cathmar, and
is also related to Mont Clair, winner of the
Villiers in 1927. King has pleasant mem-
ories of both horses.
Havaspot was always favorite for the
Welter, though he had lOst. 31b.. which takes
some carrying round the Canterbury track.
About Confab fives were laid, though some
bookmakers would only go to 7 to 2 at the
end, and others would not quote him at all.
Confab is a rather intractable beggar, and
for a while he gave Nowland a very uncom-
fortable ride; it really seemed at times as
if the boy would be bumped out of the
saddle. However, he kept his seat and his
head, and nursed his mount for a late run
on the rails. It proved effective; after Snow
Sun (20 to 1) had actually passed him
about 50 yards from home, Confab won by
a head from the outsider, Senator (20 to 1),
being third. Havaspot, though fourth, was
never dangerous, and it will be some time
before he is at 2 to 1 again on a Sydney
course.

On the eve of his departure for M.L. to
attend the yearling sales there, George
Jones won a juvenile race at Epsom (Vic.)
for W. R. Ivemball with Staghorn, a colt of
high promise. The son of Hunting Song
went out a hot favorite and never left the
issue in doubt, scoring by four lengths from
Lady Syghton, with the consistent Maid o’
Mine third. Tindall had a strong fancy for
Lady Syghton. Though a speedy filly and
as beautiful as they make ’em, she could
not concede 31b. to Staghorn, who ought to
shine in the autumn.
Khartoum, who won the Winter Stakes at
Raudwick last year, now has a box in the
Mordialloc stable of Jack Holt. He started
in the January Handicap, but was above
himself in condition, and w T ould have
been a “skinner” for the bookmakers
if he had won. Earl Leicester, whom Claude
Goodfellow holds on lease from Holt, was
a slightly better favorite than Karomin. The
latter led early and then petered out; Earl
Leicester did not get into the picture at
any stage. Winner was a 16-to-l chance,
Starissa, trained by Jim Pengilly, who was
head man for C. T. Godby at the time of
Purser’s Caulfield Cup success and after-
wards took over the preparation of A. T.
Creswick’s team at the Allendale Stock
Farm, Mentone.

The winner of each division of the Trial
Stakes was ridden by little Skidmore, who
threatened to outrival Duncan as a flat-race
joekey in Victoria about a year ago. The
fame of Skidmore waned temporarily, but
there is no doubt that he handles a horse
well. Yanac, whom he piloted to victory
in the first division, belongs to Claude Good-
fellow, •wftiose representative in the other
event, Star Player, was soundly beaten by
Marthaguy. In preferring the mount on
Marthaguy no error was made by Skidmore,
The Cooltrim mare carried more money than
any other candidate and justified this sup-
port by leading from end to end. She is
trained at Werribee by Leyshon, who won
the first King’s Cup at Flemington with
Spear Maiden.

Going out at 9 to 4 in the Plate, Hard
Words looked to have the race in his keep-
ing when Beautify was carried out wide
at the home turn. However, the daughter
of Beau Fils went after Hard Words, and
got up in time to gain the verdict by a neck,
Beautify belongs to T. M. Burke. Peni-
broke, purchased by Steve Masters from
Tindall a few months ago, was at odds-on
for the Welter Mile. He bowled along mer-
rily in front until Kitty O’Shea joined issue
a furlong from home. The. Limond gelding
lost balance by jumping a crossing, but in
any circumstances Kitty O’Shea would have
won. She is doing Wolaroi much credit as
a sire.
* * * *
Olympian (Pantheon—Flimsy), winner of
the Westralian Derby and favorite (at 5
to 2) for the Perth Cup, was beaten into
third place in that race. His backers
grumbled afterwards (as did the supporters
of Satmoth in the Metrop.) that Knox had
brought his mount out too soon. He is
rather prone to do that in a distance race,
though his tactics have served him well in
sprints. The Cup went to the Maoriland-
bred Alienist (Psychology—Orofino), owned
by J. P. O’Hara and ridden by Corry who
went out at 12 to 1; Adelines March (16
to 1) was second, the time being 3mm.
26jsec. W. 11. Vincent, owner of Olympian,
landed a consolation prize in the Coronation
Plate on the last day of the meeting, m
which his colt made Bajardo, from South
Aus., look like a hack.

M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Walter Browning (14st. 51b.) and King
Elliott (list.) both hail from Maoriland, but
this did not induce them to spare one another
when they wrestled at Leichhardt. Brown-
ing seemed the heavier by stones rather than
pounds. This extra bulk enabled him to
score the first fall with a crotch-hold, slam
and press in the fourth round. Elliott’s
flying tackles evened the score half-way
through the sixth. In the process Brown-
ing was sent to sleep, and the referee pointed
to Elliott as that gentleman strode proudly
round the ring.

English Eleven matches with country
teams often take on a circus aspect, and that
with a Victorian country side at Ben-
digo proved no exception. It was arranged
that the Victorians should bat 13 men and
England 11. Jardine, however, decided to
bat 12 men, and a proviso was made that
any man of the 12 could bowl. Larwood,
as twelfth man, succeeded Tate, after the
latter had a spell at the creases, and at one
time Hammond, Pataudi and Sutcliffe were
spelled in the pavilion. Bendigo’s first
knock of 215 comprised a sterling 55 by
R. Porter, who treated all the bowlers con-
fidently. Larwood (4-29), Verity (3-43)
and Mitchell (3-58) took the wickets. Jar-
dine and Leyland failed again, but Sutcliffe
(91) and Hammond (67), with help from
Pataudi and others, put the visitors in the
lead.

Following on the third Test, which begins
at Adelaide this week, England, which had
an interesting time at Bendigo—it was at
Bendigo that Jardine was caught by a face-
tious square-leg umpire on his 1929 visit—
will tackle the rival goldfield of Ballarat.
On Jan. 26, the tourists will open against
N.S.W. in Sydney and then on to Queens-
land, where Toowoomba, Queensland and the
fourth Test will engage their attention. On
the way back they play Newcastle and then
the grand finale of the fifth Test at Sydney,
beginning February 28. By way of anti-
climaxes, matches against Victoria and
South' Australia will close the Australian
tour.
* * * *
“Historicus”: An interesting announce-
ment by the Board of Control is that it is
considering the publication of a history of
Australian cricket. I trust it will show
how the money was cut up when players
ruled the roost. The Board has any
amount of documents and balance-sheets
which, if published, would quickly satisfy
those ignorant of the pressing reasons for
its inauguration that it has been the salva-
tion of Australian and international cricket.
“Subiaco”: Contrary to popular opinion,
the young Westralian batsman Bromley,
now doing so well in Victoria, does not hail
from Lancashire (B. 4/l/’33). He was
born in Fremantle, and until he departed
for the Cabbage Garden played all his
cricket there. Only 21 last. October, he
learned the game at Perth Christian
Brothers’ College, and was later one of
Arthur Richardson’s colts. Six feet high
and weighing 12 stone, he bats and bowls
lefthanded.
(Continued on next page.)
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham”: Hopes of a Davis Cup team
going overseas this year have been somewhat
dashed by Hopman’s announcement that he
will probably be unable to make the trip.
That is no reason why the tour should be
abandoned. This season has shown that in
McGrath and Quist Australia.has two most
promising young players on the verge of the
first class. Turnbull, of South Australia, is
another likely player who only wants first-
class practice to improve out of knowledge.
Neither Hopman nor Crawford is likely
to get any further, and Crawford’s consistent
inconsistency, as shown once more in _ the
matches with the Americans, makes it. a
waste of money to send him again. Quist,
McGrath, Turnbull and another youngster
to be selected from the half-dozen promising
boys offering would probably give a good
account of themselves with a bit of luck in
the opening drawing, and would gain most
valuable experience. If we arc to send a side
over to be beaten, for goodness sake let it
be one young enough to learn something.
* * * *
“Cut Shot”: If a Davis. Cup team goes
from Australia this year it is proposed that
it should return by way of Japan instead
of the usual tour of Central Europe after
the Davis Cup uproar is over. Australia
has promised Japan a return visit and ful-
filment is overdue, while there will be
more money flying about in Nippon than, in
Germany and other European countries.
Further, if Japan is visited, the shortest
cut would be across America, and here again
the travellers would have a chance of pick-
ing up a little more chicken feed along the
route.

“Blade”: Stung by the prospect of
losing the N.S.W. eights championship which
it has held for years, Mosman Rowing Club
is rebuilding the crew which has been so
soundly towelled up by its rivals this season.
Ron Butler, who succeeded Les O’Callaghan
as a winning stroke in the old eight, is com-
ing back to' the seat, and Jordan will go
to No. 6 vice Kirby. Mackney, the Rugby
footballer, will be in number 2, and Reg
Daly will coach in addition to coxing the
eight. It is rather late in the day to make
changes, for an eight preparation is a
long and strenuous business. Butler, how-
ever, is confident his crew can retain the
title.

The annual swimming championships of
N.S.W. at the Domain baths provided some
exciting finishes. The outstanding event,

presentative Noel Ryan in lOmin. 42 2-ssec.
S. Herford, who was second in lOmin. 52

the three Australians who have broken 11

was retained by P. Hooper, who won in

Ins and Outs
The second Test match between England
and Australia at Melbourne will go down
in cricket history as one of the most excit-
ing of the long series, fortune chopping from
one side to the other throughout the game.
England opened its second innings needing
251 runs to win. When Sutcliffe and Leyland
were not out at stumps on Monday for 43, it
looked odds on their side making the • runs
easily next day. The Australian bowlers
rose splendidly to the challenge. At 43
O’Reilly bowled Sutcliffe (33) and Wall
soon accounted for Leyland (19). Iron-
monger then took a turn, dismissing Fataudi
for 5. Hammond was caught in the long
field off O’Reilly for 23, and Ironmonger
got Jardine for a duck. Ames went to
O’Reilly for 2 and then Allen (25) and
Wyatt (25) made a good but hopeless stand.
None of the others did anything, and Eng-
land was all out for 139, losing by 111
runs. By general agreement, there was
little wrong with the wicket. O’Reilly
bowled magnificently to take 5 for 66 off
24 overs. Ironmonger had 4 for 26 and
Wall 1 for 23. Of the 126 Tests played to
date Australia has won 51, England 48, and
27 have been drawn.
* * * *
“Wreckawd”: Bradman’s century in the
second Test gave him yet another record.
With seven he has now scored more centuries
in Test matches than any other Australian.
Vic. Trumper and Billy Woodfull are in
second place with half a dozen each.
Trumper finished up his career with a total
of 2263 runs and an average of 32.79. It
looks as though Bradman will heat those
figures. Clem Hill with 2660 leads the Aus-
tralians and Hobbs (3636) the Englishmen.
“Statist”: The Melbourne ground is evi-
dently a favorite with Bradman. His three
centuries in Test matches in Australia have
all been made there. Here is a conci-
dence: he has had 17 innings in Tests
to date —two of them unfinished —and has
scored a total of 1545 runs; thus his aver-
age is 103- —the same as his last score.
'>■ '!* : ! ;
“Bumpk”’: On the third day of the second
Test in Melbourne the turnstiles registered
68,188 incomers and the cashbox reported
takings of £5790 7s. Last season’s football
final between Richmond and Carlton beat,
the attendance by 1536, but not the receipts.
Nobody has yet been able to explain why
the Melbourne C.C. is not under the same
obligation as theatre proprietors to inform
ticket-buyers as to the condition of the
house. A “Standing Room Only” notice
outside the grounds might . have saved a
few casualties.
***:!!
“Richmond”: Stated that £l2O has been
raised in Melbourne (a lot more is expected)
in order to present Mrs. Bradman with a
memorial of her husband’s 103 in the second
innings of the Melbourne Test. England
was beaten by 111 runs, and Australia would
have won if Bradman had made a duck in
his second shot as well as his first. Fingle-
ton, McCabe and Richardson, who put Aus-
tralia 59 ahead in the first innings, must
not be forgotten either. The great innings
of McCabe in the first Test has also been
passed over without financial recognition.
In plain fact the Australian bowlers won
the second Test, and to them the honor —
which is all they are likely to get—belongs.

N.S.W. had little trouble in defeating the
weak Queensland side in their Sheffield
Shield match in Sydney. The home team
made 273 and 303 and Queensland replied
with 150 and 203. The star turn for N.S.W.
was that of left-hand bowler C. Hill. He
made 91 in his second knock, and took 12
for 67 in the match. Queensland bottoms
the Shield points list with a large fat egg.
N.S.W. looks home and dried with 23, Vic-
toria having 11 and South Australia 10.
* * $ *
“Bramall Lane” : These people who have
been wailing about the possibility of injury
to batsmen following on fast leg-stump
bowling would have been scorned by the
giants of the past. When Ernie Jones made
his first appearance in England against Lord
Sheffield’s Eleven at Sheffield Park in 1896
he knocked spots off W. G. Grace and F. S.
Jackson —all the others were “frightened
out.” Both made good scores, however, and
the way in which the “Old Man” hooked
Jones’s fastest stuff aroused the admiration
of everyone but .Tonesy. Grace had one of
his ribs broken, but nothing much was said
of it outside a heartfelt address on the sub-
ject which the “Doctor” delivered to Jones
on the spur of the moment.
Racquet and Bawl
“Glenelg”: After the decent showing in
Melbourne it was expected that our
tennis-players would do well against the
Americans in the third Test in Adelaide.
As it was, they flopped dismally, the Yanks
winning by 9 rubbers, 24 sets, 188 games
to 3 rubbers, 10 sets, 138 games. On the
opening day Gledhill, Allison and Van Ryu
won their singles from Quist, Hopman and
Moon, though Crawford and Hopman scored
from Vines and Gledhill in the doubles. On
Monday Gledhill beat Moon, and Allison
went under to Crawford. Vines downed
Ilopmau, and Allison and Van Ryn beat
Moon and Quist. The last day saw young
Quist score a meritorious win from Van
Ryn, while Vines polished off Crawford in
two straight sets. Vines and Gledhill won
their doubles from Quist and Moon, whilst
Allison and Van Ryn outed Crawford and
Hopman.
* * >ii
“Kooyong”: Ellsworth Vines has tem-
pered the wind to the shorn lamb with some
flattering remarks about the standard of
Australian tennis. The best players should
get as much first-class tennis as possible,
lie said, but they “should not be kept play-
ing for months in unimportant tournaments
and exhibitions,” a criticism which shows
that Ellsworth has kept his eye cocked on
the Australian official gate-money chasers.
McGrath should be shooed off all big tennis
for some time. In America this would be
done, and he would be put under a first-class
coach to build up his forehand and .service.
Adrian Quist, Vines thinks, is at present
a. better all-round player than the Sydney
boy, but he also is in need of expert coach-
ing.
* * * *
“Fitzcray” : Vines has been telling a Mel-
bourne interviewer what Tile Bulletin has
been pointing out for months—that while
McGrath is a most promising tennis-player,
he is as stale as last year’s Sunday-school
bun owing to being run off his legs for gate-
money purposes. Vines added that if the
TOO HIGH A COLOR.
UMPIEE: “Hey! Wot yer doin’ to the ball?”
B OWLER: “Just taking the shine off it, old dear!”
policy was persevered with the boy would
inevitably go to the pack as a first-clasS
tennis-player. It was announced after the
Melbourne Test that the kid would rest for
weeks. Yet a section of the Sydney press
is confidently counting on his appearance in
the final Test against the Yanks in Sydney
this week.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Gnoolooma” : A golf club has been
formed at Mungindi, a rural hamlet which
straddles the Macintyre River, part being
in Queensland and part in N.S.W.— I or at
least that was the case when the writer
knew it. In those days there was no talk
of golf, the principal amusements being
“cattle dealing” and celebrating the cutting-
out of the Australian Pastoral Co.’s sheds.
When that happened the news was carried
down to Collarenabri by the floating bottles,
and all hands caught their horses, or some-
one else’s, and went up river. The only
stymie in the place was the State Customs
barrier in the middle of the bridge, and if
holing out in one was unknown, it was
always easy to find someone to shout for
the crowd. And now that pastoral simplicity
is to be invaded by golf! One can only hope
that all will go well.
* * * *
“Hoylake”: The revised scratch scores as
approved by the British Golf Union came
into operation at midnight On December 31.
No accounts of early matches under the new
rules have come to hand, but as Scots are
apt to be abroad in large numbers at that
date and time, it is not unlikely that some-
thing of the sort has been attempted. Tests
have shown that the average carry by a
scratch player has increased by 10 yards for
a drive from the tee and by. five yards for
a brassey shot through the green. The hew
system enjoins that on the fastest course
par will be three for holes up to 250 yards,
four for 250 t 0 470, and five over
470 yards. As some of the modern holes
run up to 600 yards and over, not many
players are likely to finish level with par
on them with only a five allowance. The
new scheme has been based on the .increased
travelling power of the ball, the longer and
straighter hitting following on the adoption
of steel shafts, and the improved; condition
of courses.
* * * *
“Cranwell” : Stoke Pogis, immortalised by
Gray in his “Elegy,” is more famous nowa-
days for its golf course, one of the best
inland ones in England. In a four-ball
tournament there recently the match finished
at the 23rd hole iff darkness with the sides
all square. The curfew tolled the knell of
passing day at the 18th, but the players per-
sisted, the tie continuing until the 22nd, when
the balls could not be seen in flight. At
the 23rd, after one player had tried a short
pitch shot with a mushroom lie had taken for
his ball, it was agreed to suspend the match
and replay it over 18 holes next day.
*!* -J*
“Brassey”: The Australian Golf Club’s
new house at Kensington, replacing that
destroyed by fire some months ago, promises
to be one of the finest and most up-to-date
of its kind in Sydney. The building, which
is expected to be ready for use by March,
stands on the hill above the fifth green and
is a handsome edifice of brick. The build-
ing cost is estimated at £20,000 and another
£2OOO will be spent in furnishing. Special
features are two lounges for men and women
members, each opening oh to a wide glassed-
in verandah. From these an uninterrupted
view of the whole course can be obtained.
The par of the new course will be 70 as
against 71 for that now in use, and the
length 6387 yards as compared with 6483.
Queensland’s open and- amateur golf cham-
pionships will begin on July 5 on the Bris-
bane club’s links at Yeerongpilly, and will
continue to July 15 inclusive. The open
will occupy July 5 and 6; 72 holes of stroke
play, 36 holes each day. The amateur four-
some will be staged on July 8, the contest
being 36 holes stroke. The first round of the
amateur championship will be reached on
July 10, the first eight amateurs in the
open playing off in match play over 36
holes. The semi-finals and finals will take
place on the two following days,. each being
36 holes of match play. Several handicap
and bogey events help to fill a comprehen-
sive programme. Entries close June 30.
Car and Cycle
“Whizz”: It will soon be time for Mal-
colm Campbell to load up his reconditioned
Bluebird car and make for Daytona. It is
worth noting what a small margin of time
lies between his 253.9 m.p.11. and, say, 270
m.p.h. The first calls for a mile in 14.175ec.
and the second for one in 13.35ec., while 280
m.p.h. stands for a mile in 12.8 sec. and- 300
m.p.h. for a mile in 12sec. dead. That is,
in raising the speed 46.1 m.p.h. from 253.9
m.p.h. to 300 there would be a difference
in drivinsr time of only 2.l7sec. Yet that
small gain may easily cost from £lO,OOO to
£15,000 to achieve.
♦
“Hotham”: Great preparations are being
made for the Tourist Trophy motor-cycle
championship to be held at Phillip Island
(Vic.) on January 30. The race will be
over 100 miles, or 16 circuits of the rect-
angular course, instead of 200 miles, as when
the Victorian, J. Pringle, won in 1931.
Pringle again won the 1932 event, this time
at Bathurst (N.S.W.), over a course of
101 miles. Pringle, who will again figure
at Phillip Island, appeared with success in
the Isle of Man T.T. race after his Bathurst
win, finishing twelfth out of a very large
field. This year most of the States will be
represented, Queensland sending down three
riders for the first time.

“Mt. Eden”: Maoriland saw its first
Grand Prix race for motor-cycles recently,
the venue being Auckland, a centre which
is always ready to try everything once. The
contest was divided into the usual classes,
and the innovation was a great success. The
350 c.c. class was won by L. Perry on a
J.A.P., and the side-car event by A. Myers,
riding a 976 c.c. Royal Enfield. The race
for all powers went to F. Forder on a
Norton, with H. W. Touren second and S.
Moses third.
* * * *
“Fitzcray”: On January 1, Ossie Nichol-
son, the Victorian and Tour de iFrance
distance cyclist, started out on his attempt
to improve on the achievement of Englishman
A. A. Humble in riding 100 miles a day for
365 days of the year. Nicholson in-
tends to ride 110 miles a day, or
40,500 in the year, and started off
with a run to Sorrento and back, a dis-
tance of 115 miles. The riding will be con-
fined to Victorian and N.S.W. roads, and
Nicholson will carry on with his usual rac-
ing programme on roads and tracks into the
bargain. Complete arrangements have been
made for checking the performance. Nichol-
son is riding a Dun Top-shod Malvern bike.
Miscellaneous
“Colonel Damurize”: Though field sports
are rather out of my line, I cannot help
calling attention to the fact that another
batch of young females collapsed as the
result of taking part in some sports organ-
ised in Sydney by a body of mixed national-
ity styling itself the Highland Society. One
girl had to be removed to hospitaj, where
she still is as I write. There have been
many other instances, some at the Olympic
Gaipes, which go to prove emphatically that
Nature did not intend women to be men.
and is always apt to visit her displeasure
on flappers who attempt to ignore the
fact. Legislation should put a stop to femi-
nine athletics of this kind. The bulk of the
medical profession is against them. If tip)
modern girl is anxious to indulge in com-
petitions I am prepared to offer cups for
floor-scrubbing, dishwashing, cooking and
nursery management tor a start. If I
have a good win in the lottery I may extend
the notion.
* * * *
“Spike”: If Australian runners were as
slow as some of their officials this country
would not be credited with many records.
An outstanding instance is that of Queens-
lander A. Gray, who broke the Australian
120 yards hurdles record in 1915. His time
was only officially recognised last year. On
that basis record-breakers at the recent Aus-
tralian championships will have to wait until
1949 for their certificates. Attention has
been called to the matter by an argument
between A.A.A.A. officials and the starter
at the national meeting. This official has
refused to sign the records forms in some
instances as a protest against the “slipshod
methods” of the association. Also he avers
that one record-breaker —a female at that—
beat the pistol, while a discus-thrower got
a “record” with an underweight implement.
Supposing these charges to be correct, he
has a right, under the rules, to withhold
his signature.

Alfred Whereat, who died the other day
in Brisbane at 46, was proof positive that
hereditary craftsmanship has not entirely
vanished. Like his forebears, he was a
mighty builder and sailer of boats, his
specialty being the skiff classes, in which
he excelled. His first boat to win an Aus-
tralian championship was Clar Merv in
1920, and the same craft won in the two
following years. Other boats of his building
that took the national title were Ajax
(1923-24), Ajax 111. (1927), Ajax V.
(1930) and Ajax VI. (1931), all 16ft. skiffs.

Distinguished Social Life.
The Wanganella, the latest addition to the
Huddart Parker fleet, is named after a
N.S.W. sheep station, and this writer won-
dered if she had been classed among the
sheep or the goats when her invitation was
only for the second tea-party with which
this ship celebrated her arrival in Sydney.
However, after encountering former banker
C. M. C. Shannon and a few shipping and
consular somebodies, she decided the odds
were about even, and settled down to a
voyage of discovery. If you walk ten times
around the first-class deck you’ve done a
mile. In the lounges and stairways you walk
on de luxe rubber in blurred patterns of red,
green and yellow, and at correct intervals
good carpets occur. The upholstery and
furnishings are all good and comfortable, but
aren’t up artistically to the beautiful fit-
tings of the ship itself. One lounge is
panelled in sycamore that gleams like grey
satin, and here the windows are Gothic in
shape and set with diamond leadlights. The
smoking-room has a raftered ceiling, and its
high and open fireplace is decked with china
plates. It has wing chairs and deep-backed
leather sofas. There’s a library, and a tiny
open-air cafe, of? the bar, and there’s _ a
nursery with nursery rhymes illustrating its
walls. Here are a rocking-horse, a sand-
pile and other baby delights.
The cabins range from single- to three-
berth, and the swagger ones have cedar-
lined wardrobes. There are two possible
suites of bed-sitting and bathrooms should
there be any millionaires taking the trip
to Milford Sound on the 12th. If the
sitting-room is required then the berths mas-
querade as two couches done up in rose
and gold lame. L. G. Schmitt, head of
Maoriand’s Government Tourist and Trade
Bureau, broadcast a description of Milford
Sound, and Captain G. B. Bates did the
honors at the tea-drinking. Sydney’s new
Mayor, R. O. Hagon, and his lady were
among the visitors.
Kitty Dickinson, one of the star nurses
of St. Vincent’s, made as pretty a bride as
St. Patrick’s on Church Hill has blessed
for many a day when she exchanged vows
with her John Hill last week. The wed-
ding was simplicity itself, Kitty going from
the home of her friend, Mrs. Clifford, of
Bellevue Hill,, to St. Pat.’s, where she claimed
her ring and her husband. Then happy John
Hill and his bride went direct to the
Niagara, which carried them off for a honey-
moon in Maoriland. The bridal outfit was
in beige tones, the frock cut on tailored
lines and the hat very trig and small.
An Australian in England had been pay-
ing a late autumn visit to Brighton. At
Stafford’s Restaurant she found a notice
to “Patrons With Dogs.” And this is a
copy of it: —
PATRONS WITH DOGS.
KINDLY OCCUPY TABLES IN THE WING
DINNERS FOR DOGS.
3d. per Bowl for Small Dogs
4d. „ ~ „ Large Dogs
sd. „ ~ „ Outsize Dogs
RAW AND COOKED MEAT.
BROWN BREAD AND VEGETABLES.
It is quite the right thing to take your dog
to the seaside, though you will of course
leave your infant at home; and the pro-
prietors apparently got tired of patrons put-
ting their own plates down for the dogs to
clean up. No doubt, the alternative of
throwing scraps to dearest Fido under the
table was found to have its disadvantages,
too.
Some of pretty Janet Thatcher’s friends
received photographs of her in her presenta-
tion war-paint for Christmas cards. The
Sydney girl did not confine herself to the
social playgrounds of Europe; and in her
travels she managed a call at Leningrad in
company with the much-discussed Lady St.
Clair Erskine (she’s the one who referred
haughtily to “twopence-a-hundred” bridge at
Government House, and to other details of
our State vice-regal household). The two
saw an opera there, beautifully staged and
presented; apparently a parental Soviet
provides bars, if not vodka or bread, for the
brotherhood. In London Janet stayed with
the Eustace Holroydes, whose address is
Ennismore Gardens, and whose flat was
formerly the residence of James Burns. The
flat is always crowded with visitors, and
already in London the Holroydes are as
noted for their hospitality as they were in
Sydney.
Joyce Beazley will be among the debs, at
the June Court this year. She goes off
under the wing of Miss Isabel Crowdy, and
after a tour of Asia will go on to Canada,
where Isabel’s brother is aide-de-camp to
the Governor-General. In London Joyce’s
headquarters will be the Crowdy household
in Chelsea.
Sydney girl Penelope Cay went off a week
or two ago to Beaudesert, the Queensland
home of tbe Willie Collinses. She took with
her two very important parcels, the flowing
rhythm of green chiffons and the regular
garden-party white crinoline hat which she
wore last Saturday as Dorothea Collins’s
bridesmaid when Dorothea became Mrs. lan
Scott. Dorothea’s frock, which was sent up
from Sydney, was of white romaine, swathed,
and with long sleeves puffed and rucked to
the elbow r . Her flowers were gardenias;
Penelope’s were tiger lilies.
This Letter was told last week by Phillip
Lewis that the Pickwick Theatre group is
being disbanded. This seems a pity, for
while the Pickwickians never pretended to
be highbrow, or to present audiences with
gloomy soul-searching problems, they have
given Savoy patrons many nights of bright
entertainment. These amateurs specialised
in up-to-date comedy, and Phillip, Lewis was
equally clever as actor or producer.
The New Year adds still another group
of drama enthusiasts to tlie long list which
decorated 1932. This new venture calls
itself the Impressionist Theatre, and aims
at “training amateur actors according to the
best methods of modern impressionism.” It
has for its producer Dr. Raoul Cardamatis,
who has worked in modern Continental
schools of theatrical production. The force-
ful Dr. George Mackaness is the president,
and the committee includes Ruth Bedford,
Mrs. Albert Cazabon and Professor T. G. B.
Osborn among its dozen or so of members.
Plays in foreign languages will be producted
by the Impressionists, and lectures on
costume, stagecraft, the philosophy of the
theatre and so on are part of the year’s
programme.
Thirty-nine years ago, in the goodness of
his heart, Thomas Walker set aside a
hundred thousand pounds to establish a con-
valescent home for patients from the hospi-
tals of Sydney. This home is on the Parra-
matta River, and is set about with flower
gardens, shrubberies, kitchen gardens and
paddocks. It grows its own pigs and fowls
and cows, and is altogether a spot to make
the sick realise that the world is a pleasant
place to be well in. In the year just ended
542 patients enjoyed the benefits of the
Walker hospital. They were all women,
for depleted income has made it necessary
to close the men’s wards and the children’s
cottage. Still, a man has not lived in vain
whose deeds are bringing health and happi-
ness into 542 lives 39 years after his death.
Dame Eadith Walker is, of course, fairy god-
mother to the hospital.
A proof that Australia will buy “home-
made” when the quality is right may be
found in the recent sale of the reproduc-
tions of pictures by well-known Austra-
lian artists. These were beautiful examples
of the printing art; old favorites by Nor-
man Lindsay, Syd Long, Blamire Young,
B. E. Minns, Herbert Gallop and suchlike
masters smiled up at the beholder as good
as new. The whole issue was sold out, and
this although, with the envelope closed, they
cost fourpence to send through the post.
Another Australian touch that made Christ-
mas parcels all the jollier was the coy
native bear or little lyrebird name-card. It
seemed much more intimate than the sprig of
holly we have been used to.

graph belongs to Jean Garling, the Sydney

The Wilfred Fairfaxes put a curl into
the New Year with their cocktail party,
which drew social Sydney to Bellevue Hill
last Friday afternoon. Foremost among
the crowds of well-dressed were a group of
young Doone fledglings, all anxious to sec
schoolfriend Margaret in her wedding finery.
For the big attraction of the afternoon
was a moving-picture of the wedding at Holy
Trinity, Brompton, of pretty blonde Mar-
garet to Peter Moore, her handsome Ceylon
planter, and of the reception (at the Rem-
brandt). The bride looked radiant in her
shimmering white, and the wind in her tulle
veil had ruffled it halo-wise. Mrs. Fairfax
deepened the atmosphere by wearing the
frock she had worn at the wedding,
a luscious affair of beige-pink chiffon
and lace. A lace straw hat in the
same toning shaded the soft pink-and-
white complexion and blue eyes. A huge
bottle-brush was the most-talked-of decora-
tion in the drawing-room, and among young
things who were all eyes for the bride’s pro-
gress were Janet Thatcher, Joyce Beazley
and Betty Brenan, the last of Queensland.
The three were in mignonette-green. Alex-
ander Gordon’s lady sparkled in black-and-
white spots, and Jean Cheriton in Quaker
greys held quite a levee. It was her first
party after 19 weeks on the sick list with an
injured hip. The Peter Moores sent their
friends in Australia a Christmas card which
is really a photograph of their Ceylon home
Now’ the doctor and Mrs. Fairfax are at
Moss Vale enjoying uneventful quiet.
When the history of these troublous times
is written, the work done by the Women’s
Employment Agency, in the Department ot
Labor and Industry, will need a chapter to
itself. In the last three months alone Miss
Simmons and her band of workers have
“placed” 1750 of the 2040 out-of-work women
who registered at the bureau. Sitting back
in your chair at home, you may think that s
a simple matter of supply and demand, but
there’s a bit more brainwork than that
attached to it. Such things as the tourist
trade, Test matches and Country Week
tennis find a place in the calculations of
these experts. The tourist trade means extra
hands at the hotels and in shops and res-
taurants in seaside places ; also it means an
avenue for that so rarely demanded class
of worker, the refined elderly woman. She
will be needed to mind the kiddies while
mother and father take a holiday from domes-
tic cares. Test matches and champion tennis
mean employment for more and more char-
women, and sometimes,, for temporary cooks,
for even if husband does like the wife to
share his enthusiasms, he still wants his home
spick and span and his dinner properly
cooked.
The agency, incidentally, has nothing but
praise for the attitude of employers during
the Christmas season. The requests for extra
help simply poured in, and always there was
a tendency to offer a higher rate of wage.
Evidently the employer is finding her income
more stabilised, for the 10s. and 12s. a week
period has passed. Of course, as Miss Sim-
mons points out, these very low figures were
never offered for experienced domestic help.
There is still a small army of women seeking
employment, and the agency can supply any
class of worker.
Here’s a new photograph of the wife of
Surgeon John McKelvey, one of Sydney’s
new knights., She’s an attractive lady,
with the slim-
mest of ankles
and a genius
for hats. She
makes a splen-
did committee-
woman, be-
cause she’s a
worker and
has one of
those' disposi-
tions that
simply cannot
be ruffled. She
and her bril-
liant husband
arc persistent
first - nighters,
are keen on
dancing and
enjoy a day
at Randwick.
The lady, in-
c i d e n tally,
spent much of
her girlhood in Newcastle. Photo, from
Dorothy Welding’s studio.
Mrs. Jessica Lee gave her last party at
the Macquarie Book Club last week, and
here a group of intimate friends said their
good-byes intermixed with jazz and song.
Mrs. Louisa Coward, who is taking over
the library and bridge club, was among the
guests; incidentally, she is an old-estab-
lished member of the Lyceum Club. Mrs.
Lee, who will be married and on her way
to London by March, will leave behind her
son Laurie, who is learning to be a farmer
at the Hawkesbury , Agricultural College,
and has just come through his latest exam-
ination with flying colors.
Charles Porter, a young Englishman visit-
ing Australia, is being introduced to Sydney
by Oswald Cheeke. Charles knows all about
design and furniture, ancient and modern
(which latter he hates —at least, the
accepted expression of “modern”). His
advice in the matter of furnishings is being
sought by nearly every second woman he
meets.
Eunice Meredith, of the rich contralto, is
just returning to England to fulfil engage-
ments at the Crystal Palace, London, after
a long and successful tour of her native
Maoriland. Last Friday evening, as a
JL/ondon member of the Overseas League,
she was entertained by the Sydney branch
at its new rooms, Club Chambers, 175 Pitt-
street. Miss Arline Waddy was the hostess.
Miss Meredith sang to Muriel Waddy’s
accompaniment. Madge Smith, of Maitland,
was the pianist of the evening, and Gertrude
Turnley told some curious aboriginal legends
and other stories. Notable among the guests
were William Sowden, president of the
Adelaide branch of the league, and . his lady.
Maude Sherwood was quite excited to find in
the Gruner Exhibition two paintings of Capri,
showing the. villa of the friend with whom
she spent most of her time in Europe. This
villa is on the lower slopes of Monte Solaro,
the great peak which overlooks the Bay of
Naples, and is spoken of with bated breath
because three men have leaped or rolled to
death from its heights. Three! And in'nine
months the Harbor Bridge had nineteen
to its discredit. In Anacapri, not far away,
lived Dr. Munthe, of “San Michele” fame.
While Mrs. Sherwood was in Italy she was
invited to show at an international exhibi-
tion of art in Rome. This was a very grand
function, opened by the King of Italy and
smiled upon by Mussolini. The Maorilander
had a panel of her works, and like all the
other artists she stood in front, of her pic-
tures. The public was barriered off, and
presently towards her, down the Salon,
within the enclosure walked a very elegant
lady in black. It was the Queen of Italy,
who came up, shook hands with Mrs. Sher-
wood, looked at her work with critical appre-
ciation, mentioned that she herself was a
water-colorist, asked a few questions about
Australia and with an attractive smile shook
hands once more. Imagine the hundreds of
years of ancestry it must take to make one
able to do that without any tremor of self-
consciousness before the eyes of thousands.
Mrs. Sherwood also showed at the last Royal
Academy. Her pictures were two Italian
landscapes, and in a year notable for poor
sales one of her pictures was bought for a
gallery in America.
The Little Citizens’ League of West-
ralia through its founder, Ethel R. Joyner,
sends again its New Year greetings to this
State in the form of a calendar. The calen-
dar, compiled by artists and friends of
the movement, the ideal of which is to make
the brotherhood of man the gospel of the
children of Australia, is attractively got up
in olive greens and golds.
A friend drops a note from London to say
that the carmined finger-nails grow more
aggressive and more übiquitous. With bril-
liant beads they are much relied upon for
decorative purposes by wearers of the plain,
swathed evening frock. Three rows of beads
around the neck and as many around an
arm are quite modest cargo to carry. Black-
and-white nails are seen occasionally.
If the head and heels of Lady Teazle in
“The School for Scandal” were light, her
petticoats certainly were not. Quilted and
stitched and looped, the thick satin pan-
niers of that featlierhead weighed pounds.
In the last act satins of faded rose opened
back from a front panel of lace, and on the
high-powdered wig a large black hat was
perched to the left, allowing the amethyst
ostrich feathers that wreathed the crown
and lined the upturn of the brim to cas-
cade to the wearer’s shoulder. It really was
very distinguished apparel. But if the belles
of the piece were fine, you should have seen
the beaux. John Gould, as Sir Peter Teazle,
carried first a skirted canary-colored coat,
and later a damson-hued one, and his black
Malacca cane with irascible dignity; Sir
Benjamin Backbite shone in buttercup satins
and Mechlin (or near-Mechlin) lace; as
for the brothers Surface, apple-greens and
blues clad their manly limbs.
The Rabbi and Mrs. Cohen were in the
Savoy audience watching daughter Dulcie,
who was Mrs. Candour. Ailsa Sutherland
wore a short coat of white velvet and shorn
lamb over her black velvet frock, and Mrs.
John Gould, in pink chiffons, sat with friend
Olive Allen. Sheridan’s old comedy is still
a strong drawing card, judging by the
crowded house; J. C. Williamson’s Charlie
Westmacott says of it that the finest pro-
fessional performance in Sydney was given
by the Brough-Boucicault combination, with
Mrs. Brough as Lady Teazle.
Mrs. Thornton, of Willoughby, is very
proud that her son Wallace, who is only
17, has won the Artists’ Ball Trust Fund
Scholarship, and attributes it largely to the
care and attention given to him-' by hi*
teacher, Sydney Long. This is the second
consecutive year that the scholarship, which
carries with it £5O, has gone to the Royal
Art Society, for which Mr. Long is in-
structor.
Aubrey Halloran, well-known man of law,
Dickens enthusiast and one of the Histori-
cal Society’s authorities, has given his
fatherly blessing to daughter Marjorie and
the young man of her choice, Broughton B.
O’Conor. He’s an old King’s School boy and
a son of B. B. O’Conor, Vice-President of
the Legislative Council.
Queensland doings:—
Mrs. M. F. Dalton (Orange) went to Ascot races in
lacquer red with a wide-brimmed white hat; with
her was Ella O’Shea in burnt rose pussy-willow.
Mrs. K. J. Pumfrey chose pink linen with crystal
buttons and pink sailor hat. Major and Mrs. B. C.
Bell (Aroo) were present, Mrs. Bell wearing red
with Peter Pan collar and cuffs and pandeau straw
hat. Mrs. Jules Moxon chose Bulgarian ’broidered
white voile; Mabel Cowlishaw’s dawn pink and
ochre lace was worn with a picture hat; Mrs. It.
Quiltie (Normanton) had an ivory Canton crepe
and sailor hat trimmed in black and white.
Mrs. E. A. de Haye, a resident of Ithaca, has
been keeping her 83rd birthday; her descendants
number 92—13 children, 56 grandchildren and 23
great-grandchildren. Born in Bristol, Mrs. de Haye
came to Australia in 1839, a month before Queens-
land was declared a separate colony. Her husband,
long since dead, was French; the old lady still
lives in the cottage built by him 52 years ago.
The City Tabernacle saw the marriage of Harold
Harper and Hilda Hurst, the bride’s father, Rev.
W. E. Hurst, officiating. It was a “cotton” wedding,
the bride being in white marquisette and ’broidered
net veil. Elaine Hurst ’maided in blue piqu6 voile
patterned in sprays of pink flowers. Pink 1 deeoratedj
the Hurst home for the reception.
For Muriel Webb, who is to marry Dr. R. Douglas,
Edith Frost had a party at Lennon’s amidst pink
carnations.
Another cotton wedding was that of Thomas Porter’
and Ivy Campbell in St. Patrick’s, Gvmpie. The
bride wore snowdrift pique voile and a Brussels’
lace veil. Florence Brose ’maided in cameo pink
pique voile. Pink and white decorated the bride’s!
home for the feasting. The ’moon rises in Sydney. !
Fifteen bachelors staged a ball in the Labrador:
Memorial Hall. Marjorie Wilson wore green and.
pale pink ; Peggy Menzies was in jade; Betty Hugall.
was in white with a rose design in nattier blue;
Sheila Logan chose leaf-green patterned georgette;
Miss J. Freedman (South Africa) wore white satin;
Helen Munro (Texas) was in white lace.
There was a big ball on the Oronsay. The Sep.
Levys, knights Thomas Henley and William Glasgow
and their ladies, the Picots, Dorothea Collins and
lan Scott (she is to marry him early in the new.
year) and Mrs. Hunter Bowman were amongst the'
throng.
Southport Golf Club Ball closed a festive week.
Secretary F. Lingley supervised arrangements. Peggy
Bell was in a backless gown of cactus red; Madge
Stronach chose platinum grey lace; Beryl Graham
was in pink; Peggy Menzies, Roma Sutton and Betty
Hugall were amongst the dancers. The Piel j 1 avlhou
was deeked with-colored lights for the ball.

The charity race meeting at Moonee
Valley drew a fair attendance. In the mem-
bers’ stand were Mrs. Alfred Tolhurst and
daughter Shirley, the lass in a dainty frock
of plumbago, blue hue with a white hat.
Others who patrolled the lawn were Mrs.
Ben Chaffey, Mrs. A. V. Ivcwney, Mrs. J.
F. Nagle, Mrs. Bellair, in ivory-tinted crepe
suit and blending hat; the R. M. Cutlibert-
sohs, Dr. and Mrs. Barry Thomson and
Mrs. J. Dunstau.
Among those who saw the finish of the
second Test match were Lieut.-Governor
Irvine and his lady, she a study in brown
and white in frock and millinery. With the
Irvines were Mrs. Robert Ritchie, of Deia-
lite, and Doris. Others in the throng were
Premier Argyle, the Douglas Kerrs, from-
Dunedin, M.L., Mr. and Mrs. T. Trumble,
lately returned after long residence in Eng-
land, and knight-of-the-brush John Longstaff.
The dressing was all very light and cool,
with lots of gay color, in which tones of
yellow predominated. In the matter of mil-
linery panamas and large chip straws were
in favor.
The Boy Scouts have been enjoying a fort-
night of camp life at Gilwell Park, which
is out Gembrook way. The most spectacular
feature of the proceedings was a field day
conducted in trackless country. The full
24 hours were filled with activity, which in-
cluded crossing unbridged rivers, clamber-
ing over crags, and, of course, scouting, a
patrol party being detailed to keep in touch
with the main hand without being seen.
Another task set the youngsters, earlier in
the course, was to escape from an enclosure
surrounded by an Bft. high wire entangle-
ment, hypothetically highly charged with
electricity.
Matters seem to be well in train towards
providing this city with a permanent orches-
tra worthy of its musical reputation. The
Uni. Orchestra which is subsidised from the
Northcote Trust, has amalgamated with the
Symphony Orchestra, over which Fritz
Hart’s baton used to wave, which removes
all fear of a clash of interests. Sydney
Myer has offered £lO,OOO, and Jimmy Dyer
made a conditional offer of a similar sum a
long while ago. Altogether, it is estimated
that a capital fund of over £30,000 can be
scraped up for the cause.
The Government’s benevolent plan to
domesticate workless girls has received a
setback owing to the obvious disinclination
of a considerable proportion of them to be
domesticated. The Sustenance Department
pays the girls at its sewing centres 7s. 6d.
a week if they are living at home, and 12s.
6d. if they have no home. Apparently they
didn’t mind sewing, but when the call came
for them to undertake a course of three
weeks’ instruction at domestic schools ’ on
the same terms, 70 of them out of 200
absented themselves.
We’re at present being visited by a small
army of Y.A.L. boys from other States. The
lads have been quartered in the gym. at St.
Kilda baths, which they appreciate, as it
enables them to start each day of strenuous
sight-seeing with a swim. There’s a lot of
histrionic ability in this squad, and they’ve
formed a “white minstrel” co. which gave
a good show at the Railways Institute on
a recent evening, and now proposes to tour
the vv'estern District and the Wimmera. The
youngsters are not nearly at the end of their
travels yet—Canberra and Sydney are next
on their itinerary.
The after-Christmas sales are very allur-
ing. Beautiful and usually expensive frock
fabrics are down to half-price and look
good buying, for our summertime is yet
to come. There are most exquisitely-pat-
terned chiffons at ss. a yard, and figured
crgpe de Chines at 3s, lid. Cotton crepes,
canvas and open-meshed materials, striped
silks, voiles and muslins run as low as Is.
a yard. Ready-made frocks are all marked
down, and hats are extraordinarily cheap.
Arrayed in pearl-embroidered white satin,
with a pearl-encrusted halo from which
descended a flowing veil of tulle, Mary Doug-
las Graham changed her state but not her
Surname, the lucky man being Thomas, son
of the H. I. Grahams, of South Yarra —he
was not related. The bride is only daughter
of. the late Lorimer Graham, of New York,
arid of Mrs. Knowles Harker, of Malvern.
The knot was tied at St. John’s, Toorak, in
a pink-and-white floral setting, with a full
choral service. Natalie Wood, Marion Kettle-
well, Alison Mein and Winsome Warren
’maided in frocks of pale-green chiffon and
large hats of the same shade of organdie.
There was a reception afterwards at No. 9.
The wedding of Scoutmaster R. B.
Saunders and Kathleen, daughter of Richard
Kay, of Oakleigh, was an open-air affair,
conducted at the Scouts’ camp, Gilwell
Park. The ’groom wore the scout shorts and
scouts made a guard of honor. The Rev.
E. Nye, chaplain of Wesley College, tied
the knot at the altar lately dedicated by
Archbishop Head.
Barrister John X. O’Driscoll, of this city,
took to wife Marie, daughter of D. Canny,
of Werribee, at Newman College chapel.
The bride, who is a niece of Mrs. M. J.
Canny, of Melbourne, wore white lace with
the usual orange blossoms and tulle, and
her trio of ’maids also chose white lace with
crimson roses about their hair and velvet
belts of the same shade. A little train-
bearer sported fluffy white tulle.
Jean, second daughter of the late George
Russell and of Mrs. G. R. Blackwood, of
Langi-Willi, Linton, is wearing a sparkler,
the gift of Ewen, third son of the late
Donald Mackinuon and of Mrs. Mackinnon.
Mrs. Norman Brookes, now a C.8.E., has
been president of the Queen Victoria Hos-
pital for the last nine years, and has steered
the institution through a whole .sea of finan-
cial troubles. Mrs. Alice Baker, who also
comes in for a C.8.E., is the widow of
Thomas Baker, one-time managing-director
of Kodak, Ltd. Like her late husband, Mrs.
Baker has given freely to all forms of
charity. Before failing health circumscribed
her activities she was a leading member of
the N.C.W., and her interests included the
Austral Salon.
This year’s National Gallery travelling
scholarship, 1 worth £225, which gives the
holder two years’ study in London, goes to
Eileen Robertson, the ninth woman to win
the prize.
The W. S. Robinsons, lately returned
after a long sojourn in London, have rented
the seaside home of the L. K. S. Mackinnons
at Portsea.
Helen Borland, head of the Presbyterian
Kindergarten, South Richmond, and Nancy
Shum, who is on the teaching staff of the
Carey Grammar School, Kew, were passen-
gers for England by the Strathaird. They
will combine study with their holiday.
A successful candidate at the leaving cer-
tificate exams, was Neil Westh, a blind lad,
who gained honors in Latin and history. He
was allowed to typewrite his answers. He
intends to go to the Uni. with a view, after
graduation, to .joining the teaching staff of
the R.V.1.8.
Jean Batty, who has been understudying
Mary Hotham in the Firm’s Gilsullivan co.,
and who is due for advancement when her
principal, who has married, retires, is a
graduate of the Albert-street Con. Her dad
was killed in the Great War, and the R.S.L.
sent her to the Con. on a scholarship.
A well-earned niche in the New Year
honors list is that of Edith Onians, hon.
sec. of the
Newsb o y s’
Club, who
comes in for
an 0.8. E. Her
active interest
in her news-
p a p er-selling
proteges has
endured for 30
years. She
visits their
homes and
makes the ac-
quaintance of
every member
of their fami-
lies. and she
keeps in touch
with the “old
boys” of the
club. Their
loyalty and
confidence are
her only re-
ward. The State in general gets the benefit
of Miss Onians’s experience in her capacity
as a magistrate of the Children’s Court, and
she is a regular visitor to the prisons.
Melbourne burglars evidently make a close
study of the social columns of the news-
papers. Houses vacated for the holidays and
the homes of the newly-wed are favorites
with this fraternity. A bride of the other
day told the Chatterer that her house had
been visited, but fortunately the wedding
presents had not been sent from her former
home. To express his disapproval of this
precaution, the intruder smashed up the
lady’s dressing-table.
At Flinders for a summer vacation are
Colonel and Mrs. E. Harrison and their
family, Mr. and Mrs. Hamilton Fitts, the
C. J. Aherns and Dr. and Mrs. H. B.
Devine. At St. Andrew’s are Mr. and Mrs.
11. Laidley Dowling, of Rose Bay, Sydney,
with their family.
Vera de Bavay. who has just come back
from a European jaunt, is to make her home
in England. She has returned only to gather
up a trousseau, for in May she is to become
Mrs. “John Higgs in London.
Honolulu liked Fritz Hart’s conducting
so much last year that the Melbourne
composer received another invitation to
direct the island’s symphony orchestra. He
will be away from December till May, a
period when Melbourne concert-goers are in
the habit of listening to the sad sea waves.
11. W. Osborne, g.-m. of the Western
District Co-op., who went to Ottawa as
one of the “advisers,” his specialty being
dairy products, was as ill as the late Sam
McKay when the conference ended. For
a while his friends feared he would find a
grave in England or on the ocean’s floor,
but he picked up totyards the end of the
voyage, and is now going strong again. Pro-
ducers from all States are assembling in
Melbourne to receive his report, due this
week. He wil give some inside information
regarding the recent slump in the price of
Australian butter in London as compared
with Danish.
A Dickinson-Monteath camera made this
portrait of Mrs. Max Meldrum, wife of the
painter, who —So far as Australian art
is concerned,
at any rate —
has founded a
new school.
Max’s better-

Frenchwoman,
hailing from
the district
where her hus-
band painted
h i s picture
“The Peasant
of Pace,” orie
of the trea-
sures of our
National Gal-
-ler y. Mrs.
Meld rum is by
profession a
singer. She
has appeared
at the Opera
House i n
Paris, and has
ambitions concerning a continuation of her
career in Australia. In addition to her voice,
her assets include a very accomplished accom-
panist in the person of her daughter Elsa.
Eda, the other daughter, is following in her
father’s footsteps. The Meldrums lived in
France for many years, and it is only re-
cently that Max returned to his native land.
Suits in corduroy for morning, velvet
frocks for the afternoon, with cavalier cuffs
and collars, and velvet sheaths for the even-
ing are almost a mania in the lands of the
North, reports one girl just back in the
land of the sun. This girl also speaks of
patchwork-quilts seen at the Anglo-Danish
exhibition, and tells of quilts made in pic-
turesque designs in the old American
colonial fashion. But Melbourne already
knows those patchwork-quilted treasures.
Many clever needlewomen here have exhi-
bited them.
Adelaide items :
Thelma Baulderstone is to be married on Jan. 25 to
Stuart Symons. The bride-to-be is a star performer
with the Adelaide Repertory; she also produced the
musical comedy “Dutini” at the Theatre Royal
in professional style, and played the leading role.
The S.A.J.O. had a capital New Year’s Day meet-
ing. Mrs. 11. P. McLachlan was acting hostess for
chairman Whitmore Carr, and it took two committee
rooms to hold the afternoon-tea attendance. White
marocain tailored suits with large white straw hats
and red frocks gave relief from the popular patterned
silks. Mrs. McLachlan wore a brown and beige
stripped georgette made on diagonal lines, and a
small beige hat with coat to match. Lieut.-Gov.
Murray was present—it is only in his official capa-
city that racecourses see him.
Dr. and Mrs. C. E. C. Wilson, with their daughters
Honor and Yvette, have left on a trip to Maoriland,
where they will spend a couple of months visiting
relatives.
Victor Harbor had great crowds during the
holidays; though it was positively cold there
were surfing and dancing at the Blue Lagoon
every night. On New Year’s Eve, Mrs. D. H.
Cudmore entertained a large number of friends at
a dance at Adare, and, as usual, the cannon in the
grounds was fired at midnight. The Governor and
Lady Hore-Ruthven, who were guests of Mrs. Cud-
more last year, cabled their Christmas greetings.
Mrs. Sidney Ayers, of Clare, gave a farewell
luncheon for Ursula Barr-Smith. Ursula, with her
brother, T. E. Barr-Smith, and nephew Jimmy
Gosse, left by the Strathaird on a trip to England.
Mrs. John Shiels, her daughter, Mrs. George
Brookman, and three of the latter’s children, have
left on a trip to Tasmania.
Speck spindrift
Very quiet, owing to the illness of the bride-
groom’s father, was the wedding of Mona, youngest
daughter of the late knight Henry Jones and his
lady, to Desmond Oldham, of Launceston. The
wedding garment was of a delicate shade of parch-
ment crepe romaine, worn with a hat in soft dark
brown tones.
Rita, only daughter of Mr. W. T. Ferrall and the
late Mrs. Ferrall, and C. T. Tyson, of Launceston,
were madp one at the Margaret-street Methodist
Church. The bride’s frock was of beige lace over
pink, with large black hat. Sister Mary Tyson,
the only ’maid, wore floral georgette in pastel
shades, with big picture hat.
The West Coast was the favorite objective of
holidaymakers. Some went into camp by the way ;
others stayed at Queenstown and Strahan. The
weather broke the record for cold and wet most of
the time, but there were occasional fine days when
the glorious mountain and river scenery showed at
its best.
Ida, the clever medical daughter of the J. A.
Birchalls, Launceston, has been appointed resident
medico at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, Sydney.
She took her medical degree at Sydney Uni.
Musical Ciceley .Kelly, who has been studying at
the Melb. Conservatorium during the last few years,

engagement to G. W. Gibson has been announced.
At the T.T.C. races, Launceston, Chairman and
Mrs. Clemons dispensed refreshments in the committee
room, Mrs. Andrew Raeburn lending a hand. Mrs.
Clemons was in black and white figured crepe with
black hat. Daughter Anne was in strawberry
shantung.
The way of the West:—
Cupid has been doing some straight shooting at
the Yelverton family. Mrs. Lowe (who was Lena
Yelverton) was married without fuss or fripperies
to Dr. Tim Gillespie. Mervyn Yelverton and Grace
Bahen are also a newly and quietly wedded pair.
On Perth Cup Day, Mrs. Doy Forrest, w> J a sym-
phony in lilac. Her parasol was a fluffy hie and
her hat was encircled with flat petals. Hilda Lee
Stef re wore graceful beige laces and jade-green
millinery; Mrs. Geoff Heannan, in white, accom-
panied her tall husband; Mrs. Edgar Grant wore
black with ornamental shrimp-pink insertions on
her sleeves ; Jacqueline Wright chose foulard of old
rose patternings; Peggy White wore pinky shades
and sister Moya mixed oranges and lemons with
success. Mrs. Winterbottom, in blue, did the honors
at the official luncheon; Mrs. Ambrose was another
hostess, the Moulden lady and her daughters being
guests of honor; Mrs. C. H. E. Manning’s frock dis-
played a spring-green background; Mrs. A. G.
Lovell’s choice was deep blue georgettes; mist-
grey laces fashioned Mrs. Kitching’s graceful gown ;
Mollie Mahood chose grey and pillar-box millinery ;
Dr. Gillespie escorted his bride, attractive as always,
in floral chiffons with lime-greens predominating;
Mrs. Veil flew a red scarf with her white frock;
Josephine Temperley was a slim attraction in her
beige laces banded demurely with brown velvet
about waist and elbows.
The State Handicap round up the Christmas
meetings. Green lawns showed no blemish from
their heavy usage and a welcome breeze rustled
through the tender green of the plane-trees. Mrs.
Durack wore misty blue foulard; Mis. Hadley's
choice was nutmeg laces; Elsie Paxton’s black
georgettes displayed pin-tuck trimmings and ruchings
of cream' lace relief; Mrs. S. E. Graig wore a little
red hat with her plainly-cut floral linen ; Mrs. John
Walsh’s effective toilette ran to green and black
with a cape effect, and sister Maude Mitchell chose
greeny crepe de Chine; Betty Rosenstamm also
preferred the springtime shade, spotted with white
and worn with a jaunty white pique waistcoat;
brunette Mrs. Bill Crommelin wore black with
touches of white here and there; Mrs. Guy MacLeod,
in burgundy, brought along her youthful daughter
Joan; Mrs. Vic. Secombe was all in red, and her
sister Eileen Hayes did her punting in a floral
garment. One of the smartest turnouts was Mrs.
Bob Cameron’s white and jade marocain, worn with
a large and airy hat.
Bonnie Shnderson and Bob Giles slipped off quietly
at the close of the old year to seek out Dean Moore
in St. George’s Cathedral. There was no orange
blossom and very intimate friends only were admitted
into the secret. Bob is the third son of the late
J. O: Giles and Mrs. Giles, of Claremont; Bonnie is
the second daughter of the A. Sandersons, of Cottes-
loe. The young couple are continuing their respec-
tive jobs on the “West Australian” and the “Daily
News.’’

The Dream Ship.
BY CAPTAIN JACK HAMILTON.
“Oh, a limejuice ship coming up the river
Blow, boys , bloiv!
With ’ gallant-sails set and royals a-quiver
Blow, boys, bully boys, blow!”
HER masts towered high—almost to the
sky—in the soft twilight. Her snow-
white wings, spread from the wide
courses near the deck, and tapering to the
pocket-handkerchief royals set from the
giddy trucks, were daubed by Nature s
artistry carmine and gold as they became
silhouetted under the spell of the setting
sun. The ease and grace with which she
glided along without mechanical power in
a mechanical age gave her the appearance
of a dream-ship sailing across a sea in
Fairyland—so jaunty her poise, so tranquil
the way she made through the. waters of the
blue Pacific.
As the tug waiting to take her in tow
bore down upon her, the old clipper seemed
to become more majestic. Above her bow-
wash a neatly-carved figurehead, fashioned
long ago in one of those quaint old shops
hidden away behind shipbuilding yards and
full of bright paints and pots and carver s
tcrols, stood out strongly above a clean-cut
bow.
Nearer and nearer drew the tug; yet not
a single stitch of canvas was furled. Was
she going to sail right through the Heads
and up to an anchorage? Or was she a
mystery ship without a crew?
Old Tom Browning’s grey eyes and
weather-beaten face provided a study ill
pride and rapture as he watched her from
the deck of the tow-boat that hovered in
the offing. He was one of the old school.
One who had stuck to windjammers to the
last, and who, despite his age, still hoped
to go deep-sea again in a limejuicer. If he
had been forced into steam for a crust, his
heart was still with his first sea-love, the
sailing-ship, propelled over the Seven Seas
only by seamanship and God’s own wind. No
greasy engines or 'newfangled engineers for
him! No gritty, dirty smoke! For him, no
bare steel decks, necessitating incessant chip-
ping, but wooden decks, always clean as
a new pin, a fleecy spread of sail in place
of smokestacks, and real sailormen for ship-
mates instead -of the glorified machines
called steamboat sailors!
His heart fluttered anew as he listened to
the strains of the incomer’s John Chantey-
man piping up the tune of “Sally Brown”
when the crew began to take in sail.
“Sally Brown , I love your daughter —
Way — hey—foil and go!
Her eyes are clear as crystal water —
Put my money on Sally Brown.”
The chantey and chorus gave the lie to
the tugboat fireman who had been saying
that the dirty, tattered and unrecognisable
ensign at her gaff was not a Union Jack.
He could tell a Red Duster miles off, he
could. “Not much o’ the furrin about that
there ditty, my, hearty, eh?” Old Tom
reproached the younger man with a glint
of triumph in his eye as the chorus was
repeated again and again.
After all, there must be one full-rigged
ship under the British flag that they had
not heard about before. There and then he
made up his mind to keep a close watch on
her in port. The mate would be sure to
be wanting at least one real seaman to do
the splicing and the fancy work that the
young fry had never learnt.
His cherished dream of another voyage as
a real sailor in a real ship—God, was it
possible ?
' He was a bit disappointed, now that the
wind had veered more to the cast and given
her a fine slant up to the Heads and a fair
wind through them, to hear her skipper
order the tug to come alongside and take
the towline. None of the limejuice skippers
of his day would have even deigned to look
at a towboat under such conditions. Most
of them would have sailed right up to Cir-
cular Quay itself if no interfering port
officer had stood in the way.
But times were different now. Different
ships, different long splices! Nevertheless
among the hands on hoard there might still
be one or two who had whacked marmalade
with him in the Loch Lomond, the Cedarbank,
the Kinross-shire, the Mount Stewart or in the
many other splendid ships of his acquaint-
ance. As soon as he got clear of the tug,
after she had di-Qpped the towline, he would
seek out his old cronies. It would be
fine meeting them and yarning qver a noggin
at the Ship Inn. Even if Nellie, of the
Clarendon, wasn’t there to serve them, the
atmosphere of the great days still lingered
there.
While Old Tom mused, yards came rattling
down the masts, tackles chattered, blocks
cheeped. Orders were issued rapidly; but
to Tom, at that long distance, and with a
fresh breeze now blowing, they were unin-
telligible. His hearing, like his eyesight, was
not what it was.
His ears were alert enough, though, to
catch the strains of the next chantey and
to join the choruses as he paced up and
down the tug’s deck, with the younger hands
smiling at his obvious enthusiasm.
“It's a long, long time since we scoffed a
fat hog —•
To be way — hey—hey — ho!
And a long, long time since the shipper -said
‘Grog!’ —
A long time ago.”
The ancient, his elation notwithstanding,
eyed the furling of her canvas .critically.
Mates were not so particular about harbor-
stows these days, he concluded, as the , last
sail was made fast in an untidy, lumpy
mess.
But with darkness his dream-ship was
resurrected. In the night of a thousand
eyes above and around her, she seemed to
glide further into Fairyland. Claret stream-
ing from the rays of her port light blended
with the vermilion gleams from Vaucluse
leading-light beacon; and ferries passed,
flashing like glittering jewels.
Came more pulley-hauley on the ship, and
more chanteying as the heavy hawser was
hauled aboard and the running gear was
coiled up, shipshape and Bristol fashion.
And at last the mate’s welcome final in-
junction : “B’lay, everything! That’ll do,
men!” In the departing tug Old Tom could
not hear it; but he sensed it on hearing
the chantey leading up to it and the lusty
cheer which followed
“ Oh , times are hard and wages poor —
Leave her , Johnnie, leave her!
We’re packing kits to go ashore,
For it’s time for us to leave her.”
Rather unsteadily the ship’s gig made
for Watson’s Bay jetty some hours later.
She had passed the doctor on arrival, in
.spite of the hour, and Old Tom had taken
himself thither in the belief that her skipper
would -take a run ashore, after his long pass-
age, to get his land legs.
His pulse beat faster as the boat
approached, and his heart seemed to be
thumping and pumping at the .rate of knots.
He shouldn’t have hurried like that at his
age, but, maybe Bert Westcott, who had
sailed with him in five different packets,
would be there; or Peter Macaulay, the
finest splicer he ever knew; or Joe Ray-
ment, who cleared out from the Black Dia-
mond and married a barmaid in Newcastle
when they were in the Firth of Forth to-
gether—ay, these and many another worthy
.salt recurred to him as he stood there with
his eyes glued on the nearing craft.
“Can’t say as Bert or Pete is as handy at
featherin’ oars as they was,” he mused when
one of the rowers nearly caught a crab an d
temporarily stopped the boat’s way by dis-
organising the stroke of the others. “A bit
out o’ practice, like me, maybe. There’s no
West-Coasting through the surf in gigs these
days to keep their hands in.”
The mere thought of the West Coast of
South America caused hundreds of fleeting
kaleidoscopes to form and vanish in his brain
with lightning-like rapidity. Liberty days
in Iquique and Antofogasta. The arid Andes
looming up wherever they rode on the stub-
born mules provided for their pleasure when
on leave. Dahces.hr the bright cafes. Dark-
eyed senoritas. Pisco. Anisol. Chilian
wine, and golden sovereigns to stand treat.
A month’s pay went a long way there then.
And they thought more—a lot more—of a
sovereign than of their dirty paper pesetos.
It would be good to have a trip there now
after all these years! Carmen would be fat,
perhaps, but pleased to see him, as she had
always been, in her Callao cabaret The
ship might go there with coals from New-
castle, as so many hookers used to in his
palmy days!
Old Tom’s soliloquy ended abruptly. His
dream-ship vanished.
. “Gif her der strong pull, Yo Yonsen, you
gordamt squarehead!- You haf nearly the
yolly-hoat capsize.”
The skipper was half-Swede. half-Finn.
The ship was sailing under the Finnish flag.
Her crew comprised many nationalities, but
not a single Britisher. " They had simply
learnt our old chanteys by rote, as other
people learn Italian opera arias.
To add to the ancient’s cup of bitterness,
the vessel, as he could'discern by the name
on the gig in the lamplight,; was one of the
old-time limejuicers on which he had
weathered many a stiff breeze round Cape
Horn under the red ensign. She had been
“sold foreign” long since.
Like one in a trance he stared at the
hands clumsily manoeuvring the gig after
the skipper had disembarked and given them
orders in an alien tongue.
“First they took our ships, now they’ve
stolen our chanteys. Don’t seem to be much
left. Everything sold furrin.” \
A giddy sensation overcome him. He could
hardly breathe. He sank into a seat facing
the sailing ship nt anchor.
None of the joyous ferry trippers -return-
ing from the dance in the Palace Hotel
bothered about the old man snopzing in the
moonlight, with his head on his chest.
He was still there at _ daylight, a little
more huddled, with' a smile playing on his
pale, motionless features. But his limbs
were cold and stark.
Back to the Bush?
Sometimes I’sit and watch the West,
Where the trees are like black lace,
With the crimson beams of the sinking sun
Shining across my face;
And I stop the sounds of the snarling town
■ With my thumbs upon my ears,
And long to be back in the Bush again
(jood God! How many years?
I long for the road to Hunthawang
That wanders along the Plains,
With the clover up to the bellyband.
After the winter rains;
To feel the swing of old Sailor’s back,
And the saddle between my knees,
And hear the old horse snort again
As he sniffs the sunset breeze.
The croak of frogs in the billabong,
The “tonk!” of a bullock-bell,
And the first call of the land curleic—
I know them all so icell!
I’d give what little there is to give
To ride across the plain,
Half through the night, to Hunthawang,
By the Lachlan, once again!
To pull the saddle off Sailor’s back,
And the bridle off his head —
And then a smoke and a drink, with the
boys....
And the bachelors’ hut.... and bed !
But if I went back to the Bush again
And rode to Hunthawang,
There’d be no hut, and tliere’d be no boys,
And the whole thing would be wrong!
The wild soul of the Bush is dead,
And the kind hearts of the track
Are scattered and gone this many a year:
And I daren’t, I daren’t go back!

Brisbane, 6 a,m.
Pale lilac wash of skies, and birds like
threads
Unravelled from the night, and blown across
The stealing light that comes before the
dawn.
Ere yet day’s orange ball has left the hills
And trundled through a cleft to find the
sea.
Out of pale distance comes the roll of wheels:
A sparrow with a grass spire in its bill
(A busy craftsman careless of Awards,
Or just how many , hours make its day)
Already darts, intent upon its job,
Towards the eaves where hangs the half-
made nest. ,•
A cat slinks sleekly underneath the gate,
Stops, cleans its face, and poses Innocence.
Night in the valley yawns, and disappears!
Then, high and loud as giants’ laughter,
peals
The glad wild challenge of the city chimes
From that tall ivory tower that guards our
town —
yV trumpet call to drowsy lie-a-beds:
“Be up and doing, for T bring the'day.”

Sometime During
1933
THE PUPILS OF
BERNARD CRONIN
STORY-WRITING
PARAGRAPHS
ARTICLES
A N. S. Wales pupil wrote on September
9, 1932:
“I have already received about £3O for
stories and articles, As writing is a pro-
fession with all the initial difficulties and
setbacks of most professions, together with
a few of its own, and I regard myself as
still serving my articles, I do not feel that
I have anything to grumble about. I have
to work at night, often after a long and
tiring day, which is a big drawback. Still,
£3O is a profit of just 200 per cent, over
your very moderate fee for the Course.
"I doubt if I should have sold a line
if it had not been for the splendid training
Mr. Bernard Cronin gave me. I had been
rejected so many times that I was on the
point, of giving up, and would probably
have done so had 1 not obtained your
prospectus and decided to take the Course.
“Apart from Mr. Cronin’s exceptional
experience and thorough understanding of
the art of story-writing, I think the best
features of the Course are his candid criti-
cism and extraordinary patience. The be-
ginner needs both in large quantities, and
Mr. Cronin certainly supplies them. I
am very grateful to him for the kindly,
patient way he led me along the literary
track—and also for the hard knocks he gave
me when I deserved them.”
A N.Z. pupil wrote on November 15,
1932:
“My story ‘Leavings’ gained first place
in the ‘N.Z. Tablet’ short-story competi-
tion from 140 entries from most parts of
New Zealand. The prize is £5/5/-. This
is the one I submitted with Question and
Answer for Paper nine and which you said
I should place if I persisted.”
A Victorian pupil wrote on November
9, 1932:
“I am pleased to say that I placed
‘The Cub’ with the ‘Australian Journal.’ ”
In the past few months we have received
many similar letters to these. At the third
lesson Mr. Cronin tells his pupils whether
it is worth while going on. That accounts
for the early successes of those who do
go on.
Copies of “Writing to Win” and “Writing
for the Newspapers” are sent free to those
interested.
Write to Mr. Cronin at 398 Flinders Lane,
Melbourne. It will save time and bring a
more helpful reply if you say what your
aspirations are and what your writing ex-
perience has been.
OPPORTUNITY
AND
PERSONALITY
TO know thoroughly one depart-
ment of work or effort is good;
to turn that knowledge to the
best account is better.
In the last analysis, it is not
facilities for acquiring knowledge—
these are open to most of us—but
the possession find extension of per-
sonal qualities which carry one man
ahead of others.
When a man has learned his piece,
served his apprenticeship and become
a craftsman, worked hard and become
skilled on the land or in factory or
workshop, gone through the pre-
scribed course and become a profes-
sional or business man, when, in
fact, he is in possession of know-
ledge and skill, what is he going to
do with them?
That depends on his personality.
It is here that the extraordinary use-
fulness of Pelmanism to the man
himself is apparent. It wakes him
up, opens his eyes to possible uses of
his acquired skill and knowledge,
widens his outlook, and establishes
his standing among other men. It
makes of him an individual, a strong
personality, as well as a sound and
constructive worker.
Pelmanism has done this for 31,000
people in Australia and New Zea-
land
You are sure to be interested in at
least one of the people who, in “The
Efficient Mind,” speak highly of Pel-
manism from practical experience. It
•may be a prominent personality who
has captured your imagination, or it
may be a neighbor who has earned
your respect. Get a copy of “The
Efficient Mind” now—write at once.
Pelmanism may be mastered by
giving to it 20 or 30 minutes a day for
about three months. There are 12
lessons in the Course. It is intensely
interesting, and the results begin to
show within a week. It is taught by
post.
The Headquarters oj the Pelman Institute
are in London. There are branches through-
out the world.
$50,000 World Pelmanists
31,000 Australian and New Zealand
Pelmanists
SOMETIME during 1933, whatever the general
conditions may be, your opportunity will come.
And there will be more than one opportunity, for
opportunity is always knocking at the door of those
who are ready.
SEEING AND SEIZING THE OPPORTUNITY
Readiness means seeing the opportunity and seizing it.
Seeing calls for alertness of mind, supported by attention and
comparison, the setting of one thing against another, the full considera-
tion of advantages and disadvantages; in brief, quickness of thought and
soundness of judgment.
Seizing the opportunity calls for prompt decision, initiative, energy
and courage, all the qualities summed up in the words confidence in
oneself.”
PELMANISM IN 1930-31-32
Pelmanism is peculiarly adapted for the development of the qualities
exercised in the seeing and seizing of opportunities, and in helping men
and women of all working ages and doing all kinds of work through
the difficulties of the present day. This has been shown conclusively
during the past two or three years, first by the letters we receive, secondly
by the advancement of Pelmanists in many walks of life, and thirdly
by the enthusiasm of those going through the Course. Students say
with the first or second lesson: * This is what I want. It will put me
on the right lines,” and they press forward eagerly to get all the help
they can as quickly as they can. We have never had more keenly
interested students, sending their work in with such regularity and report-
ing such serious application to the progressive exercises.
Students work regularly and consistently, and with such enthusiasm,
because, in every section of the Pelman Course, and in every letter of
advice, they find something of definite practical use to them in the
conduct of their daily lives.
It is to your advantage to know what Pelmanism is, what it has
done for others, and how it will prepare you for seeing and seizing
the opportunities that will present themselves during 1933.
