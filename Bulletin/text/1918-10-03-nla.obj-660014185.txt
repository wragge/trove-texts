BEFORE THE MIRROR
By “JEANNETTE.’’
These are, undoubtedly, days of exceptional nervous strain for one and
all of us. Anxiety, with its beauty-destroying influence, is casting its shadow
over the lives of many of us women, and while perhaps a few—the more
stoical among us —can avoid worrying over past and prospective events, we
may all, with a little care and forethought, succeed in preventing the results
of worry from being noticeable in our appearance. To these fortunate
few this little chat will, however, be as interesting and instructive as to
those who stand in real need of help in toilet matters, and may be the
means of bringing to their notice some hitherto unknown method of retain-
ing or regaining that beauty of face and figure which is the birthright of
every woman. Some of the ingredients mentioned below are, at present, not
generally known to the public, but any good chemist will usually be found to
have a small quantity’ in stock.
Some Hints about the Hair. —An Excellent
Shampoo—Few women realise how all-impor-
tant a really good shampoo is if the hair is
to be kept in perfect condition. To shampoo
the hair properly, sli*ke it down, comb it out,
then dip the fingers into a little pure olive or
almond oil. and thoroughly massage the
scalp. Then mix a teaspoonful of stallax
granules in a cup of warm water. Fill a basin
with warm water, into which the ends of the
hair can fall, and shampoo the stallax mix-
ture into the roots in the usual way. ltinse,
and dry by fanning, or in the open air, if the
weather permits. Should the hair be excep-
tionally greasy, the oil massage of the scalp
should be omitted. Stallax can be bought at
any chemist’s in quarter-pound sealed pack-
ages. It keeps indefinitely, and one package
is sufficient for 25 or 30 shampoos.
A Tonic for Thin or Falling Hair.—When the
hair falls unduly, or has become thin and im-
poverished, a tonic should be applied every
night for six or eight weeks. To make a
simple and inexpensive but most efficacious
lotion, at home, take a quarter of a pint of
bay rum and add to it one ounce of boranimn.
Shake thoroughly, and leave for 30 minutes;
then strain, and add sufficient water to make
half a pint. Every night massage the scalp
for 10 minutes, going over the entire head,
then dal) the mixture into the roots with a
soft sponge. Regular brushing for a few
minutes every morning will also help to im-
prove the condition of the hair.
A Greasy Skin and iJlaekheads. —A greasy,
oilv skin, with blackheads and enlarged
pores, is a sore trial, and many a girl goes
through life with her appearance entirely
Spoiled with these unsightly blemishes, which
may now be so quickly and effectively removed
with but little trouble. To remove blackheads
and the dull, dirty look of the skin which
accompanies them, dissolve one stymo! tablet
in a glass of hot water. Allow the elferves
cence to subside, then dip a small soft sponge-
into the liquid and bathe the face. Leave on
tlio skin for a few minutes, then dry with a
towel, and the blackheads will come right off.
For a greasy skin, bathe the face three times
a week with stymol and spray with cold water
every morning, using a vulcanite throat spray.
The Secret of a Good Complexion.—The secret
of a good complexion is so simple that, were
it only more widely known, there would be
no such thing as a rough, blotchy skin.
Nature has decreed that the outer cuticle,
when it shrivels and dies, shall be removed;
but so many women fail to realise this. To
remove, by absorption, the dead outer skin,
and preserve the complexion in all its pris-
tine beauty, mercolized wax is recommended,
ordinary creams and lotions being quite in-
effectual for this purpose. Smear the wax
over the face and neck, rub it gently into the
skin, and leave for the night. In the morning
wasli it off’, using a good soap, such as
Pilehta, and all the dead skin will be removed
with the wax. Then apply a lotion to re-
move any' trace of greasiness and brace up
the skin, making it firm and white. The lotion
can be made at home quite easily, by mixing
one ounce of cleminite in four tablespoonfuls
of hot water. Bottle, and, when cool, apply
to the face with a soft sponge, or the tips of
the fingers, allowing it to dry on the skin.
ANSWERS
TO CORRESPONDENTS.
C.B.—Clynol berries will reduce your weight.
They are harmless, and no alteration need be
made in your diet. They have also one great
advantage over other flesh-reducers: they re-
duce so” gradually that there is no fear of
loose, flabby skin and wrinkles.
ZULA. —No, I am afraid I cannot tell you how
to prevent yourself from biting your nails.
You must exercise your will power.
CONSTANCE.—To remove the yellowness
from your skin, get a tin of mercolized wax
and apply it every night, rubbing it well into
the skin. Leave it on till morning; then wash
it off with warm water and a good floap. (2)
To give a color to the cheeks, get a little col-
llandum and rub some on a leather. Apply this
to the cheeks. It gives a perfectly natural-
looking flush to the face, and is quite unde-
tectable. (?>) To remove the-blackheads, take
a styinol tablet and dissolve it in warm water.
When the effervescence has subsided mop the
lotion over the face, allow to remain on for
a few minutes, then wipe off, and the black-
heads will disappear.
GEORGIE.—I am not surprised to hear that
the electrolysis treatments were not success-
ful. They seldom are. Get an ounce of phe-
minol and a tube of tekko paste. Use them in
conjunction, and you will soon be rid of the
troublesome superfluous hair.
SHEILA. —To restore your hair to its original
color, get two ounces of tammalite and mix it
with three ounces of bay rum. Apply to the
hair every night or morning. In a couple of
weeks there will be no sign of the greyness.
Tammalite is not a dye, but a natural re-
storer.
ELSIE.—To remove the roughness from your
skin, use a lotion made by mixing cleminite
with warm water. Allow the lotion to cool,
then bottle, and use after washing the face
every morning. fl

Look to Your Teeth.
There are no teeth like those furnished by
Nature. For service, comfort and good
health artificial teeth cannot be com-
pared with a natural set.
Sensible people will accordingly try to pre-
serve their teeth as long as possible by
keeping them clean. Cold water and soap
and water are useful, but are somewhat
ineffectual. Rough powders, such as cuttle-
fish, crabseyes, crude chalks and charcoal
are too severe on the enamel.

cally prepared to clean the teeth, sweeten
the breath, harden the gums and disinfect

Death and Laughter.
In the beginning of the 18tli century the
reincarnated Pedrolino of the Italian “CoTn-
mcilia dell ’arte’ made his first appearance as
Pierrot at the Opera Comique in Paris ; and
Debureau saw him and found him good.
Pierrot was a satirist Greek chorus in topi-
cal parody ; Debureau, by alternated debauch-
ery and starvation at Fuuambules, reduced
him to a pantomime clown —even Harlequin
(Anglo-Saxon— belle cyan: folk of hell) stole
his Columbine. And in sorrow and laughter,
night after night, Pierrot died a new death
—eagerly. In white satin for mourning, and
the black skull-cap for death (the pinched,
starved face and sad eyes for tears of sur-
prise and laughter), he knocked every night
at Columbine’s shut door; and died in the
snow on the threshold. Only the ghosl is
left.
A demi-monde ghost. Not of the traffics
of that half-world, but of its griefs and per-
plexities—for comfort. Verlaine, Oscar
Wilde, Baudelaire—many have pointed to
Pierrot as the inevitable explanation of in-
explicable things. It is not so; it is an
excuse only. Pierrot is simplicity itself:
juxtaposed laughter and death, no less —and
no more.
Certainly his spirit inspired A Defence of
Cosmetics, a magic artificiality by Max Beer-
bohm in the first issue of The Yellow Book, in
which Max subtly pleads for more laughter
in this tedious matter of death. Perhaps he
stood behind Aubrey Beardsley when he put
a shelf of French novels and a hopelessly-
modern powder-puff into a picture of the
toilette of the daughter of Herodias. He
always stood behind Beardsley, as his thin
tragic fingers were always on the consump-
tive shoulder of Ernest Dowson. But his
hand never rested on Oscar Wilde or any
other self-conscious conjurer.
The frivolous, wilful fans of Charles
Conder and their unconquerable romance of
atmosphere (in spite of > their sometimes
arbitrary drawing laws, laws of perspective,
of proportion) are as truly Pierrot as Wat-
teau’s desperate detailed accuracy. Their
wilfulness, their waywardness, their some-
times frowardness reveal the unself-conscious,
simple thought and motive of the demi-
monde with Pierrot for comfort, hot-foot on
its heels.
Norman Lindsay’s sudden single nude, in
an otherwise fully and ornamentally clad
masque, is Pierrot, elfin, tear-stained, beau-
tiful. Lindsay is his best exponent alive.
Villon, Casanova, Rabelais —and Pierrot:
Lindsay uses an incomparable, five-fold
mighty brush. And laughter and death make
seven.
The sudden red cap of the woodman in the
misting, blue willow-trees of Corot’s dawn
pictures is a perfectly legitimate and illu-
minating Pierrotism. The single, burning,
scarlet spot points up the cold, half-awake
streams and trees and emphasises the artist’s
expression of his thought without artifice.
The scene, of The Happy Hypocrite is
Hyde Park, in London, in; the springtime of
1830; daffodils shine in the grass. Lord
George Hell, whose face is unspeakably
bloated and debased, enters with two demi-
mondaincs. A young girl comes on singing
•in a minor monotone, and kneels to pull the
daffodils. Lord. George sees her, and the
old dreams of his youth ‘accuse and warn
him.; in his silver brandy flask he sees his
bestial face. The painted ladies depart;
Lord George stands full centre in deep
thought; the girl still pulls the daffodils and
sings, unconscious of his presence. To them
enter a seller of masks. His Lordship btiys
one of the unstained face of a youth; he
puts it on in the mask-seller’s covered bar-
row, and kneels with the girl and his youth
in the daffodils. His conscience speaks at
length and he confesses that his face is
not his own—that his youth is drowned in
the seas of mud behind —he lifts the mask
in fear of her horrified eyes. And under
it his face is that of a beautiful youth, as
the mask itself The play is billed as by
Max Boerbohm. but the author'is Pierrot—
for comfort.
The Dome, The Savoy, The Yellow Book,
three swan-songs of Wilde’s glittering revi-
val of semi-tones, all died in the effort to
chain Pierrot to an easel and a desk. They
mistook him for an affectation, an artifici-
ality—a symbol of wantonness in midnight
masquerade, a Folly baying the moon. The
hard, definite French school that died in
the ’nineties and called itself the Symbolists
(why, God knows) elected him an honorary
member, and sung and painted and wrote
him as an exact science, in defiance of his
weeping protests. They spoiled their own
case. Like Fergus, if he is on the moun-
tain-side just out of sight, fie is alive; face
to face, he is dead—clad in white satin for
mourning.

War and Revolution in Asiatic
Russia.
This, by M. Philips Price, is another of
the rush of books about the smaller war
fronts. There are many of these including:
The Roumanian front (suspended).
The Serbo-Montenegrm front.
The Persian-Mesopotamia front, with which is
partly merged the Caucasus front (otherwise ex-
tinct).
The Palestine (formerly Egyptian) front.
The White Sea or Finland front.
The immensely long Siberian front.
The Portuguese, Belgian and South African Union
fronts in Africa.
The Greek or Salonika front.
The Italian and mixed front in Albania, if that i*
really the name of the place.
Also the dashed front of the traitors who say the
Hun should have his old bits of Papua and Polynesia
restored to him without question.
The book is the work of a man who accom-
panied the Russians when they scrapped
with the Unspeakable among the tall moun-
tains where Armenians, Georgians, Kurds,
Mongrelians and others are mixed up. He
found the country as it had been left after
the young Turks, with their Prussian crav-

had made it a desolation. He has a good

you want no uncertainty about your Roofing. It must give certain

ASPHALTUM RODFING
has been proven. It covers large Factories, Mine Buildings, Country Homes, etc., throughout the
country, and is giving the greatest Roof satisfaction wherever it is used. On the Wool Storages
Sheds erected in Wentworth Park, Sydney, for the Central Wool Committee, 43f miles of Adamax
have been used. It is equally adaptable to both flat and steep surfaces, and its self-protecting
construction means sure and permanent service to its users.
Acids, Chemical Fumes, Sea Air, Heat, Wind, Cold, Rain —none of them can injure Adamax
Roofing, because it contains no substances that will dry out and cause the roofing to crumble or become
lifeless. And Adamax COSTS ONLY ONE-THIRD THE PRICE OF GALVANISED-IRON,

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Sea Watcher.
Dreaming beside the steamer rail,
I watch the quiet sea go by ;
The level sea devoid of sail
And bluer than the sky.
And lazily it sweetly wreaths
Upon its lips the smile of mirth;
Rising and falling as it breathes
Within the arms of earth.
While, sibilant, a jocund breeze
Is singing in the weather shrouds;
And vision walks across the seas
And stands beneath the clouds.
Crying across the skyline dim,
She haunts the barren azure plain;
Then, lonely from the ocean rim,
Turns gladly home again.
0 skies and bare impassive sea
And far cloud spiralling to towers
Hurling dumb nothingness at me!
And yet, I watch for hours.
For. gazing here awhile, I seem
A lover in some fragrant place,
Who seeks the reflex of her dream
Upon his lady’s face.

Oh. wine within ray glass! Deliciously
Your bubbles break to perfume and gold
light;
Each rounded sphere a small dream poised
for Might
To waft me from to-morrow’s certainty —
What care have I? Along my veins you
Mee,
Charging ray blood with mad and reckless
might
To slake the very stars of their delight
And dash the future from my memory!
When Life has beaten me and I full-spent
Shall come to you, my soul in devil-dare
Of torment, pour for me your rainbow blent
With dew of Lethe, that my lips may part
And drain you swiftly till my mad despair
Shall laugh at this my own delirious heart 1

Oh, cruel one, Oh, Fate!
Nor make a jest of me;

And I ero forth elate*
Go forth with singing heart,
And courage leaping high,
To my allotted part,
To vanquish or to die.
So Truth shall stand apart
From likeness to a lie !
Let me my foeman see,
Oh, Fate —’neath cunning guise
Of friendship, flattery,
Or wisdom folly-wise;
Primordial enmity
Behind my lover’s eyes.
I weary for my fate;
I weary of the jest—
The carnival of hate,
The lie, the secret quest—
Now, though the hour be late,
Speed thy unwilling guest!
Of that which keeps the key,
Of these poor gates of breath,
I ask not how it be ;
Nor what strange word It saith
That shall deliver me
From the body of this death !

The Hidden Heart.
Success it was my end and aim,
And wealth it was my guiding star,
And lest you greet my greed with shame,
I was but as my fellows are.
And time was fleet and gold was sweet,
As I rode out of Lochinvar.
As I rode out of Lochinvar
About me all the scene was fair,
The skies, with not a cloud to mar,
Were filled with fresh and dewy air,
While making song, a merry throng.
The birds were busy everywhere.
As I rode out of Lochinvar
Through Fairydom I seemed to go,
For round about, and near and far.
A strange enchantment seemed to grow;
And where I went —on what intent —
And who I was I did not know !
For 10. I met a troubadour
As I rode out of Lochinvar ;
His like on earth is seen no more.
With feathered hat and gay guitar;
And loud and clear, and sweet to hear,
He sang a song of love and war.
As I l’ode out of Lochinvar
He sang a song I somehow knew,
The while he touched his gay guitar.
And when I asked him, “Who are you?”
“Yourself!” lie said, and bowed his head,
And vanished like the morning dew.
Though I may see him nevermore,
This much in very truth I ken,
That one, at heart a troubadour,
May seem a sober citizen,
Who sets afar his gay guitar
To cheat and fool his fellow men.

FAT YEARS AND LEAN PURSES.
Until a German madman set the world on
tire it was possible for any reasonably in-
telligent citizen to follow the annual story
about the Commonwealth cash-box with com-
prehension of the major facts. The figures
were not large. Their significance was not
obscure. Now it takes an exceptionally
nimble mind to understand the yarn, much
less to remember it in detail. The figures
are swollen up in groups of eight and nine.
Their meaning is difficult to grasp. It is
one thing to talk about £1,000,000 and
another to start a conversation about
£500,000,000. Yet it is of arithmetic like
this that Australia has to get accustomed.
The job is not going to be easy. Mean-
while the politician is content to watch the
influence of the multiplication table in the
same state of astonished helplessness in
which a kid contemplates a bolting locomo-
tive. The youngster knows that if the
runaway escapes leaping off the lines or
taking part in a collision it will stop when
the steam runs out. The politician feels
certain that some day or other the collection
of figures will be straightened out and give
him a chance of seeing where he is. And
it was in some such spirit as this that
Treasurer Watt expounded the story of the
cash-box last week and threw vast masses of
figures about to adorn his tale. Watt's
Budget was without a single cheerful feature.
The record of what is happening to the
Commonwealth, taken in conjunction with
the numerous State performances, is a
solemn circumstance. It is simply no use
pretending that Australia is not up against
some mighty serious problems, or that the
old practice of letting matters go hang till
later on and forgetting all about them in
the meantime is going to be any more reli-
able than before. The candle is alight at
both ends and the middle.
The innards of Watt’s Budget was that
there had been an expenditure of ordinary
revenue of £34,975.304, and a war expenditure
of £66.742,350. During the current year in-
creased expenditure from revenue amounting
to £8,000,763 has to be provided for; the war
expenditure is estimated at £100,000.000
(£78.914,411 from loan j ; and there will_ still
remain a war commitment of £38.345.000
unpaid. The crux of Watt’s problem there-
fore was to explain how he proposed to make
the £8,000.763 available to himself. The
deed is to be done by mopping: up the sur-
plus on last year, relying on increases from
a few previously existing sources of revenue,
imposing new taxation to the extent of
£5,356,000, and annexing £BOO,OOO from
London funds, a very dubious proceeding
this last device, being equivalent to leaving
a debt unpaid and calling it income. Any-
way there it is. The new taxation will
pan out this way: —
Additional income from Customs and
Excise . . . , . . . . £1,985,000
Income tax . . . • • • ■ - 2,200,000
Land tax . . .. • • • • 380,000
Entertainments., t .. . • •• 275,000
Postage war tax . . . . . • 516,000
£5,356,000
The relative importance of these matters can
best be judged by contemplating the revenue
derived during ’l5-16 and ’l7-18 from the
sources mentioned, and the estimates for
the current year:—
Income.
’l5-16. T 7-18. ’lB-19.
Customs and , '
Excise .. £16,944,941 £13,225,295 £14,035,000
Income tax .. 3,932,775 ' 7,385,543 9,585,54-3-
Land tax . . 2,040,436 2,123,778 2,380,000
Entertainments 245,890 480,000
Postage war tax 516,000
Thus the Commonwealth will this year get
£2,1)09.941 less from Customs and Excise,
£5,652,768 more from incomes, and £339,564
more from land tax than it did three years
ago. In addition it will secure £996,000
from taxes on entertainments and postage
war tax, of which at least the proceeds from
entertainment ciyi be reckoned as a surrep-
titious income tax. The first thing to be
said about this is that the contribution by
way of land tax is grossly disproportionate
in volume compared with contributions from
other sources, and the increase of it trifling
to the point of absurdity. The figures re-
emphasise the leniency with which the Fed-
eral Parliament has treated property as a
revenue producer. Millions of capital in-
vested in war bonds have been removed from
the ambit of taxation —scores of millions of
land values either escape altogether or are
levied upon with a tenderness' that amounts
to a scandal. The latest assessment of land
values assessed for Commonwealth taxation
was £202,063.245. The contribution from
the owners towards the cost of war is at a
rate less than id. in the pound. But that
is really only part of the story. A return
submitted to the Federal Parliament in
.June last year showed the value of freehold
land alone in the Commonwealth to be
£455,876,104. There may be an excuse for
allowing this tremendous shirk by Property;
but if there is The Bulletin does not know
what it is. That the Commonwealth should
derive a greater increased revenue during
the year from taxing 3d. tickets for admis-
sion to picture-shows than from the increase
demanded from the owners of barely-touched
millions is a long way from being reason-
ably decent. The land tax should be immedi-
ately recast and the millions upon which the
nation has so just a claim forced to pay a
quota that would at least not be a mockery
of the balance-sheet.
The charges imposed by war and loans
upon the revenue are. of course, moving up
like the mercury at Thursday Island. The
expenditure on interest, pensions and so on
during successive years has been at this
rate :
1914- £640,217 i 1917-18. . £11,856,235
1915- 3,778,378 I 1918-19.. 21,129,602'
1916- 8,427,329 | ■ / ,
And it can be taken as certain that this
will be very materially increased during next
year and that the bill is going to be per-
manently on the premises. The debts already
contracted amount to £254.022,072, and the
mortgage in sight to at least £370,000.000,
which, without a doubt, will expand to
£500,000,000 and perhaps ft lot more. There
is some interlacing of State and Federal
debts in consequence of loans raised by the
Commonwealth on behalf of other Govern-
ments; but the year will close with a com-
bined indebtedness of about £750,000,000.
The interest on this will involve the earning
of £33,000,000 to start with —and more later
on, for over half the existing debt will have
to be renewed within the next 10 years, and
what that is likely to mean is about as
cheerful to think about as monuments to the
dead. Watt describes the task ahead as
being Herculean. It is all that. He
also remarks for the 743rd time that
control of the public debt should be
wholly in the hands of the Common-
wealth. The necessity for this has been,
as clear as daylight from the very begin-
nings of Federation—and yet each of
the multitudinous Governments is going
gaily ahead heaping up more debt and
being aided and abetted by the Common-
wealth. The Bulletin does not know
whether all hands are going to wait until
something bursts and then get busy picking
up the remnants. But it does know that
to go on as Australia is going now can only
result in chaps.
THE REGIME OF SIMPLETONS AND
PHARISEES.
The position of the N. S. Wales Auditor-
General makes it impossible to give him the
sack when he tells the awful facts about the
State’s finances, and the report just issued
contains more awful facts than usual. In a
general way it shows how the crowd which
has been in office since October, 1910—the
McGowen-Holman Labor Government (1910-
13), the Holman Labor Government (1913-
16), and the Holman Labor-and-Mixed Gov-
ernment (1916-18) —has degenerated. It
“scabbed” on its professed anti-loan-boom
policy at the very beginning. And continu-
ously since then it has been more of a “scab,”
more of an agent, for the foreign money-
lending capitalist and more of a servant of
the One Big City landowning interests for
the sake of which it threw over its alleged
decentralisation ideals. In its latest develop-
ments it is a sort of oversrrown clrld p'aving
at keeping shop, a species of “come-down” from
the country ready to buy a sold brick from any
Norton Griffiths combination, an easy
mark for the three-card man, and a combina-
tion of Skimpole and Wilkins Micawber.
And by comparison with its opinion of its
own ability and patriotism the ancient
Pharisee was the horse that “also ran.”
* * * *
The Auditor-General’s remarks on the in-
crease of the N. S. Wales public debt, and
the remarkable increase of the interest bill,
and the wonderful manner in which the earn-
ings of the “permanent and reproductive”
works fail to anything like meet the interest
and the cost of working have a special signifi-
cance. The explanation is that the party
which took office in 1910 had a' dicer’s oath
or “scrap of paper” or Hun peace treaty on
its programme about reducing the loan busi-
ness, which was then a quarter what it has
been since, if not abolishing it altogether;
and about spending no loan money save on
works that would pay full interest and sink-
ing fund —with these results :
The Loan Finances op N. S. Wales.

1918 .. 145,067,693 5,502,355 4 3 5
The debt is close on £50,000,000 more than it
was in 1911, and the interest is £2,138,771
per annum more. It is going up out of all
proportion because old cheap loans are falling
due and have to be renewed at amazingly
high interest—one operation of this sort has
just added £284,590 to the annual bill with-
out giving the Ma State a copper more to
spend, and there are lots more operations
coming. The Governments of Happy Chil-
dren never provided an efficient sinking fund
to meet these liabilities, even when it became
evident that great trouble was ahead. In fact
it practically cancelled what sinking fund
there was. Another cause of the horrible in-
crease in interest is that the Labor Govern-
ment of Happy Children, realising at the
beginning of the war that money was going to
be dekr, arranged with a private firm of
absentee capitalists and contractors to lend
£10.000,000 at any rate of interest that
might happen, even if it should be 10 per cent,
and to receive a large commission for super-
vising the construct.on of railways with the
money—the more spending, the more commis-
sion. As a result, the miserable community
has a collection of unfinished railways on
hand, on which work is suspended and earn-
ings are nil and interest is very healthy and
depreciation is alarming.
* * * *
It would be a redeeming feature if the
“permanent and reproductive works” which
were to “develop the resources of the coun-
try” showed some good results, but they don’t.
They haven’t paid their way since 1912; that
is to say they stopped paying as soon as the
crowd of roaring profligates who captured
office under financial false pretences in Octo-
ber, 1910, had got into its stride. The short-
age in two years (1913 and 1914) was at the .
rate of £304,335 per annum. For 1915 and
1916 it was £459,G80 per annum. In 1917
and 1918 the average was £932,361 per
annum. Or it can be put this way :—,

Hardly any of the “permanent and reproduc-
tive works” pay their way now. Even the
Government’s Sydney house property at the
Rocks is run at a loss, though it was
acquired when loan money was far cheaper
than it is now and cost about half as much
as the private builder can borrow at to-day,
and though it suffers neither from drought
nor lack of settlement. In fact, the public
works system, despite five separate increases
in railway charges and much talk of economy,
has become much of a relief business or
benevolent asylum. It is to-day a device for
buying votes, buying advertisement for poli-
ticians, and finding jobs for the largest possi-
ble number of people to disguise the fact that
employment is decaying both in agriculture
and manufactures. For the loan works have
not only failed to be reproductive—they have
also proved a fraud in the matter of opening
up the country and promoting settlement.
Outside Sydney and the Newcastle coalfields
the country, judged by population, tends to
shut rather than to open.
The visible cause of it all is the loan dis-
ease. If there were no loans to scatter
corrupt politicians would have to buy votes
and popularity out of taxes, and the people
notice the taxes, while not one in a hundred
knows whether the loans are £1,000,000 or
£10,000.000. The public work that didn’t
pay, and was never expected to do so, would
be rigidly inquired into. So would the re-
sponsible politician And if the country
spent £2,000,000 on a work that was only
worth half the amount, the lost million would
be paid for and done with. At present the
lost million eats up £40,000 or more per
annum for ever, and when a million is calcu-
lated at 4 per cent, compound interest for a
couple of hundred years, it becomes something
over two thousand five hundred millions. If
the Labor party had adopted a non : borrowing
policy as it half-promised, the State would be
to-day hundreds of million richer. It would
have no public works delict. And it would
have so much money to spend which now goes
out in paying interest that it would have a
much better public-wmrks policy than it pos-
sesses to-day. Comparing .1912 —the year
when the Labor loan razzle really started—
£2,ooo.ooo: a year has been added to the in-
terest bill in order to buy £827,947 shortage
in the public-works revenue, and these
amounts would make auite a respectable pub-
lic-works fund. Incidentally, if there had
been no loans during the past 10 years
the. State would have a very different class of
politicians. Most of those it has now are
spenders pure and simple. Some seem to be
persons of arrested mental development. But,
considering the attitude the Labor narty hag
taken up since it fell under I.W.W. domina-
tion, it is impossible to expect a change from
that quarter.

Here and there the Auditor-General makes
remarks about the casualness of exnenditure
—the open-handed generosity which men
show when they are trained in a. school which
charges the bill to posterity. He alludes to
the huge amount paid to themselves by petty
Ministers who appoint themselves on health-
trips to England and sometimes indirectly
apooint their wives also. He alludes to the
scandalous cost and abundance of royal com-
missions. Nowadays almost every million of
loan money which is put into a rotten work
requires a commission to report on its rotten-
ness.
* * ■* *
At present there is a sort of flush of
prosperity on the countenance of the Ma
State. One reason is that the Federal Gov-
ernment is borrowing £80,000,000 a year in
Australia for war purposes, N. S. Wales
being the biggest item in the case. All of
this that is paper money—and it is mostly
paper money, for gold is very scarce, and few
people see one sovereign per month—has to
be spent in Australia, for our notes aren’t
good tender anywhere else. That means that
most of the money lent still remains in Aus-
tralia, and the paper securities are here also,
and are called “wealth.” They are mostly
small securities convenient for passing from
hand to hand. So £1,000,000 is turned into
£2,000,000 while the war boom lasts, and the
extra million is handy for a gamble in subur-
ban allotments. The war has been so much
loan and so little taxation in Australia that
it is actually paying big dividends (on paper)
so far as it has gone. Then there is the out-
put of Federal notes, also a currency that
can’t go out of Australia. And on top of all
is the State’s loan expenditure for public
works, which is as big as that of all the other
States put together. So far as it is local
borrowing it adds another few millions of
paper wealth to the stock. So, taking one
thing with another, there is a good deal of
paper prosperity. The sorrow is that, though
our multitudinous outside creditor will take
payment for imports and interest hills and
for the debt when it falls due in gold, silver,
copper, lead, oats, wheat, potatoes, hides,
rabbits, cow-meat, sheep-meat, cotton, fish,
apples, wattle-bark and almost anything that
is produced by work, he doesn’t care for
paper.
FEAR.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Faintly gleaming through the dark the
luminous dial of the sentry's wrist-watch
showed one o’clock. He had been on his post
for an hour and had still an hour and a half
to go. His chilled feet squelched into the mud
as he stamped them to try and restore the
circulation. He was deadly tired, deadly
cold, and strung to the breaking-point by
the week-long battle that had quietened into
a lull of exhaustion.
Behind him rose the cold, grey concrete
wall of a pill-box ; in front a sodden, clammy
parapet of mud-filled sandbags. Right and
left and in front stretched a dreary plain of
churned-up mud, the inadequacies filled with
filthy water that gleamed fitfully in the light
of the clouded moon. He could just make
out the dim shapes of the guns over which
he mounted guard, just hear the restless stir-
rings of the sleepers in the pill-box behind.
Somewhere, away on the left, an eighteen-
pcunder was firing at intervals with a hol-
low “bong” that echoed emptily round and
round the mud flats. Far in front, where
the trench-lights threw patches of cold, dazzl-
ing radiance against the blackness of the
sky, a machine-gun was tap-tap-tap-tap-tap-
ping in bursts of five, like somebody knocking
with a stick on the door of an empty house.
lie ducked suddenly behind the parapet as
a shell came whining in a thin rising cres-
cendo, chopped off suddenly at its highest
note —a dud. To nerves braced to withstand
the shock of the explosion, the sudden silence
came like a blow. He drew himself upright
again just as a second missile whistled out
of the blackness and burst with a crash be-
hind. A whispering fragment flew past the
corner of the pill-box and sank “phut” into
the mud. Another shell, shrieking down-
wards out of the empty blackness of the sky.
exploded with a shattering roar that threat-
ened to topple the sandbags dowrn on to the
crouching figure at their base. A shower of
mud and w T ater thrown into the air by the
explosion pattered on to the surface of the
puddles, and all was still.
He crouched forward, every muscle taut,
every nerve strained in an agony of listening.
The next! Where would it fall ?
No sound.
The machine-gun had ceased its monoto-
nous clatter; the gunners on the left had
crawled into their dug-outs.
Silence.
He bit his lip till it hurt, and stood up-
right behind the bags. The moon was hidden
by a bank of clouds.
Silence and darkness.
Pie looked at his watch. Half-past one.
An hour to go.
Indistinctly in the gloom he could see the
surfaces of the stinking pools that had
formed in the shell-craters all round. As
smooth and still as mirrors their placid sur-
faces hid terrible things, he knew. He hated
the thought. He had always hated the
whole ghastly business. He leaned forward
on the parapet, but the sodden bags felt
clammy and cold to the touch, like the faces
of dead men.
He shuddered, and. unstrapping his watch,
placed it on the bags where he could see it.
The gleaming figures seemed to bring him
comfort.
A quarter to tw*o.
His gaze lingered on the surface of a big
pool that embraced the corner of the pill-box.
Its further bank was hidden from sight by
the masonry. He w r as glad he could not see
the bottom. Dead men were there, lying in
the mud. their faces all bloated and dis-
colored, their hair matted and slimy.
Suddenly from round the corner there
came the faint sound of something slipping
in the mud : then a tiny splash.
His heart contracted with horror. What
was moving in the pool? What dreadful
thing was crawling on to the bank round the
corner?
The moon, shining through a rift in the
clouds, enabled him to see the spreading
ripples on the water. Then the explanation
came to him suddenly and he sank wealdy
back against the bags, limp in the reaction
from deadly fear.


Rats, of course! What else could be mov-
ing out there in the dark among the slimy
I>o Bnt was that a rat? The sound of scramb-
ling and sliding in the mud, and another
splash, louder than the last. He cursed the
weeks of strain, the hours of watching that
had unmanned him. What a fool .He found
himself straining ears and eyes towards Ihe
corner of the pill-box.
Deadly silence all round.
He was taking short, silent little breaths
through his mouth. His heart was pounding
against his ribs, the blood drumming in his
ears. Every muscle and nerve seemed
strained to the breaking-point in a fearful,
terrifying waiting, waiting—for what? kor
a rat to slide into the water?
For something that was surely crawling
out of the pool. Some hideous thing, not
meant for human eyes to see.
Then it came. A scrambling and slipping,
a sudden loud splash, a hoarse muttering.
The water heaved violently.
It was coming round the corner.
lie ceased to breathe. His heart seemed
to stop. His arms, extended across the bags,
were rigid as iron. His neck muscles con-
tracted until he could feel the strain behind
his ears. Unconsciously he drew up one knee
and pressed himself against the bags as if
waiting a signal to vault over them.
Then a light flashed in his eyes and a voice
said : ‘Ts this the —tb battery? I’m a run-
ner from headquarters. I’ve been looking for
vou all night.”
The sentry did not answer. He was
crouching in the mud laughing weakly and
making silly, meaningless passes in the air
with his hands.

The Hole in Bananaland’s Pocket.
Queensland politicians are in a life-and-death
struggle to keep tlie permanent and repro-
ductive loan works out of the Benevolent
Asylum. Ryan’s Thousand—the complement
of * Carmichael’s Thousand, which was
named in its turn after Garibaldi s Thou-
sand —hasn’t eventuated. But Ryan s
Million—the million shortage in the railway
accounts for last financial year is on the
spot. Queensland is naturally a costly place
to govern owing to thinness of population,
though it is on a far better wicket than S.A.
or Westralia. And it is ahead of most of the
States for fertility, rainfall, navigable rivers
and minerals. This has been its railway
record for the last four years, the three last
being Premier Ryan’s years:—

The cost of imported material has gone up. of
course, and interest has gone up, and the
Ryan Government has been very liberal over
wages and conditions of labor. And it never
had the courage to put up charges to corres-
pond. Queensland has been amazingly
lucky, as a good semi-tropical State which
has, to a great extent, avoided the One Big
City curse should be, in its increase of popu-
lation and its increase of revenue. But it
hasn’t been very lucky in its financiers. Still,
they managed to keep things pretty solvent,
if the loan money isn’t mentioned, by
of a microscope and a spirit-level till the
present rough-and-tumble Ministry came in.

Ryan has been in office during 1916-17-18,
so ho has had two big shortages in three
years. The prospective shortage for the
vear just commenced was about £525,000 (it
takes an awful lot of money to keep Ryan
going in his stout, jovial way), but he pro-
poses to put on £532.000 of new taxes if the
Upper House will let him. Last year it
didn’t let him, and told him to make his rail-
ways pay better. Ryan’s State is the most
heavily-indebted State in the Common-
wealth bar Westralia —its net liability
( £60,948,852 at June, 1917) being £B9 9s. 2d.
per head, against Westralia’s £ll6 ss. Jd.
But in 1901 it had the biggest debt per head,
so though it has become a lot worse it
hasn’t gone downhill so fast as some of the
bunch. The States in the aggregate owed
£22 per inhabitant more in 1917 than in
1901. Queensland, thanks to the growth of
population, was slower on the down-grade
than Westralia, Tasmania, N. S. Wales or
S.A.
The Application of Science to
Democracy.
To assist in arriving at a settlement of the
liquor problem the Labor party in M.L.
has started to clamor for another issue. If
the issues are confined to (1) Continuance,
(2) Prohibition with Compensation, and (3)
State Ownership, Labor’s view is that the
individual who objects to compensation and
wants to fling Bung out with Od. will be
unable to cast an intelligent vote. Where-
fore it suggests a ballot on (1) Continuance,
(2) Prohibition with Compensation, (3) Pro-
hibition without Compensation, (4) State
Ownership. The obvious criticism of this
is that such a voting-paper would leave the
State-ownership issue waving perilously in
the breeze. To make the thing complete that
issue would have to be divided, for it is
very clear that if the State approached in
earnest the job of nationalising the beer-
pump a very important question relating
to compensation would have to be decided.
Under the old system of reduction in
Maoriland, pubs were shut without compensa-
tion. and it is mighty doubtful whether
Bung has any moral claim now to a dole if
any more of his premises are closed. Cer-
tainly ho has no more claim than he had
before. The question turns rather on ex-
pediency. and if the expediency of compensa-
tion is 'admitted in connection with prohi-
bition. some understanding about what it
means in relation to State ownership seems
to be wanted. How, otherwise, can the
citizen vote who believes that there should
be State ownership but no compensation?
Or the other citizen who thinks that com-
pensation should be paid? Or the citizen
who looks with disfavor on the idea of the
State buying up 237 pubs, of which less than
half would be needed as national temples of
malt, yet might favor compensation for the
unsuperfluous edifice? The Bulletin is
firmly persuaded that Maoriland will never
get to the bottom of the trouble over hops
until it goes about the matter in a more
scientific way. and. in order to give a help-
ing hand, it makes a few vagrant suggestions.
The first is that a Controller should be
appointed for 10 years at a salary
of £5OOO. That his first job should be. to
shut every pub that was obviously offensive.
Then, on condition that the others
kept up to the mark, they should be
allowed to stand for 10 . years; Bung,
in return for the security of tenure,
to place 50 per cent, of the hotels at the
disposal of the State on a rental confined to
the property value minus the license. The
Controller would then run these houses as
State institutions. The result would be
that in 10 years, if the Controller earned
his salary, the public would have a com-
plete understanding of the difference between
P.E. and State ownership—and could vote in
the light of such understanding, in-
stead of in the light of much nebu-
losity. The question of compensation would
be settled in advance. Ten years’ notice
of the possibility of having to start business
as a Reehabite would be a satisfactory sub-
stitute for cash on the spot. Meanwhile
the Controller would ration the popu-
lation through the municipal and county
councils, which, being elected on a popular
franchise, could equitably determine the
amount of booze per diem each inhabitant
ought to be entitled to. Thus each citizen
on visiting the near or distant pub would
have to produce his ration-card for inspec-
tion. and in this way establish his legal
claim to limited refreshment. Any citizen
discovered at large without his liquor-card,
or offering to swap cards with another citi-
zen, would, of course, be put on the list of
undesirable persons and have his property
forfeited to the State without right of appeal.
A Blown-out Oracle.
One of the most sadly-depreciated oracles in
Germany just now is Baron von Freytag
Loringiioven, Deputy Chief of the General
Staff, who delivered a lecture to the learned
militarists of Berlin the other day. The noble
baron, with a view to reassuring the outside
public, said : “We expected too much from
the submarine campaign, and again at the
beginning of the Spring offensive.” But this
same Yon Freytag Loringiioven published
“Deductions from the World War” at the end
of last year, the book which concluded with
these words :
In the future, as in the past, the German people
will have to seek firm cohesion in its glorious army
and in its belaurelled young fleet.
Which was accepted as the quintessence of
all military wisdom concerning warfare up to
date. He went on to say :
The unsparing application of the submarine weapon
will hasten materially the end of this mighty
economic conflict, by means of the economic difficul-
ties which it would create for our opponents and
for neutrals.
German industry furnished our aviators with such
an equipment as enabled them to establish more
and more their superiority in the air. Aviation obvi-
ously has a great future.
We shall have to consider how in future to preserve
for war the character of the war of movement, all
the more so since, in the World War, it has
only been by the war of movement that we have
reaped decisive results.
That spirit of the offensive which is peculiar to
our army we must study to preserve by every
means in our power.
It has to be considered that the Kitchener
divisions were trained exclusively for the simple
tasks of trench-warfare, The English army is by
no means fit for a war' of movement.
All this stuff sounded very clever up to the
end of last year, but what are the
facts about the “war of movement” since
March last? The Huns advanced in three
offensives, each being better than its succes-
sor. The, first push captured a lot of ground,
the second captured much less, and the third
won hardly any ground at all. The Hun
movement happened spasmodically over
a period of four months. Then the
Allies started to move forwards in-
stead of backwards, and the movement
was much better sustained than the
Hun pushes. They recovered nearly the whole
of the lost ground in half the time the
Huns needed for their “war of movement.”
The British and Dominion soldiers, “trained
only to simple trench-warfare,” were quite
successful in the movement job. Finally the
Americans, after comparatively little training-
in any sort of warfare, made a rapid advance
into territory which the Huns had held from
the very outset of their invasion af France,
when their vaunted war of movement was
practically a walk over the course. The Huns
have now got more than enough of the war
of movement which Von Baron professed to
crave for in December, 1917. Von Baron
as a “deductionist” and an adviser is a poor
comfort to his belt-tightening compatriots.
He might even be substituted for a week-end
sandwich.

Bags to Clothe the Australian Soul.
What is being done w T ith the cotton and
linen rags of Australia? In the present
paper shortage, which threatens not only
the newspapers but the production of books
with a permanent literary value, the question
is a fairly vital one. Nearly all the classic
literature of the world was printed upon rag
paper; and three-quarters of that paper was
made by hand in back yards. Substitutes
for rags were introduced about the
middle of last century; and the making ot
paper by machinery got its start in T ranee
a year or two before the last Revolution,
and reached England two years before
The starting of a great pulping
plant for the production of paper from forest
trees requires very large capital; but the
little mill to deal with ordinary rags does
not. Australia’s old shirt and blouse pro-
perly treated would preserve the best,
thoughts of Australian writers through the
ages. There is absolutely no excuse for the
shortage of book-printing paper while these
rags go to the destructor. Of course, I ro-
tection for such an industry is being afforded
at present by the war conditions, and
the lack of shipping space, but the job of
paper-making is one that the Commonwealth
itself might take up. The printed thoughts
of Australians are as important to the nation
as bread and beef; and to curtail them at
the very moment when the printed thoughts
of the person overseas are unable to reach
us in large quantity is more than
unfortunate. On the economic, side, the
starting of a few small mills would
probably cost less than the proposed
censorship over the use of book-papers;
for once it comes to granting right-of-way to
one book and denying it to another there is
going to be a lot of trouble. Decent Protec-
tion'would long ago have given us a paper
supply of our own; but now that tariff-sink-
ing has brought us to a crisis in which the
national soul, as expressed in letters, is apt
to be squelched, it is on the Government to
reconsider the position. The rags are here;
the making of the machinery locally is a
matter of days ; and even if men who knew
the trade had to be imported they could be
got here in time to put a new industry on
a solid foundation. It is the one moment
in the history of the country in which the
local writer looks like getting a show with-
out unfair foreign competition; and if the
Government can’t rise to the occasion and
help him through, it must be because the
Government doesn’t want Australian thought
to be circulated.
The Law for the Prevention of Industry
and Other Federal Finance.
One change which Acting Prime Minister
Watt promised in his financial statement
concerns the deranged and unpatriotic War-
time Profits Tax. Somewhat similar legis-
lation exists in great manufacturing and
shipping countries. It was devised to reach
the person who attempted to make big money
out of the supply of munitions and other
essentials of war at famine prices, and thus
trade oh the distresses of Europe. Coal,
wheat, meat, cotton, petrol, iron, steel and
ships, as well as guns and cartridges, were
all things that the “profiteer” had his eyes
upon. Australia got rid of less wheat and
meat than usual, and of the other things
it supplied none. Yet, with a monkey-like
gift of imitation, our legislators passed a law
to annex almost the whole profits of every
new industry or every enlargement of an
old industry designed to supply work and
wages and the much-needed goods for our
own people. Everybody who was found
starting a new industry was leaped on if pos-
sible. Of course, a little money was col-
lected. Where Smith and Brown had both
been making £2OOO a year and Smith closed
up, and Brown’s • business in consequence
increased to £3OOO. there was £7i>o tax to
be collected, though there was £lOOO less
money earned on the whole. Watt promises
to alter this in some way. Also, he proposes
to increase the customs and excise on spirits
and tobacco, these being taxes which, when
applied alike to foreign and local goods, are
guaranteed to provide no extra employment,
to create new industries, and to make
the country no more self-dependent. A
solid Protectionist tariff to begin automati-
cally the day when the armistice, which is
the usual preliminary of a definite peace, is
signed, would at least do something. It
wouldn’t increase the scarcity of imported
goods, and it would enable manufacturers to
start much-needed industries —provided the
War-time Profits madness was done away
with. They would have an assurance that
they weren’t being used simply as stopgaps
or caretakers, to be thrown aside as soon
as the pacified Hun is ready to supply the
market again. Nobody asks that we should
look beastly ungrateful by grievously taxing
our Allies’ goods. If the average tariff put
on avainst the U.S. and Canada is merely
as heavy as the one they have put on
against us it 'would suffice. Of course we
wouldn’t tax the same articles as they do.
for every sensible nation taxes tbe goods it
can produce for itself and admits free, or as
freely as it can afford to do, the goods it
can’t produce. But the essential is to go
just as high as our good friends do. not
be the one bankrupt fool in the game. Still,
the importing interest combined with the
I.W.W. interest, which denounces every Aus-
tralian employer as an enemy, is apparently
too strong. As the Price-fixer who was
formerly a Meat-fixer has now become also
a Beer-fixer, and lias enacted that, despite
the extra £1 per hogshead excise, beer is to
sell at the old price, the local beer-foundries
will probably close and leave the field clear
for the importer. The Beer-fixer probably
went on the general idea that breweries
make vast wealth, and didn't trouble to
notice that that is a thing of the past. 01
the five breweries habitually quoted on Sydney
Exchange one pays 4 per cent., two pay 6:
one S and one 9. The teetotal advocate,
who. copies his arguments from English
papers, raves against breweries because they
use up foodstuffs which are wanted for the
“famishing people.” This faded person
hasn’t learned yet that there are about
5,000,000 tons of grain unsold in Australia,
and that the “famishing people” would
burst if they ate a quarter of it. M att
proposes an increase of 20 per cent, on the
land tax, and some of the State Govern-
ments are also increasing their land taxes.
There is to be another .‘5O per cent, on
income tax as regards private persons; and
companies, however small, are to pay (>d.
in the £ all round. Companies arc; asso-
ciations of individuals, most of them quite
poor, assembled either to do things that are too
big for single capitalists, or to eliminate the
single capitalist, or to give* better security
than he can offer. Thus trustee companies
were founded because the private trustee so
very often died bankrupt, or became bank-
rupt without dying, or bolted, or muddled
tbe widow’s mite through ignorance. Fire
insurance companies became popular because
tbe private underwriter was unreliable—
and so on. In 1916 exactly 150 joint-stock
companies were formed in N. S % Wales the
average nominal capital being £26.400 and
the paid-up capital a good deal, less. But
an ignorant idea is abroad that co-operation
is something of a sin, also that it is a cor-
morant preying on the “worker" and at the
same time an impertinent obstruction to the
big individual capitalist. With these mat-
ters attended to, and a small increase of the
entertainment tax, and lid. letter postage
instead of the old penny variety, and due
consideration for the blessed imnorter, Mr.
Watt hopes to pull through. It’s a poor
reflection of a fighting jaw.
A War Literature Society lias been formed
in N. S. Wales. Addressing the members the
other day for the purpose of giving the
society an official benediction, Premier Hoe-
man remarked that “the failure of Australia
to throw herself fully into the world struggle
was due to her inability to visualise the con-
flict." Possibly it may boil down to some-
thing like that if the generalisation has to be
expressed in terms so vague and academic
that a book would have to be written to ex-
plain the terms employed. It is all very well
to speak of “inability to visualise the con-
flict,” but the most conspicuous feature of
phrases of this kind used in such a connec-
tion is their pompous sonority—and nothing
more. The Bulletin believes that Holman
or anyone else would reach the heart of the
subject much more quickly by going straight
to the point. The words “failure” and “fully’
obviously suggest that the reference is to
compulsory military service. Now, it is
merely footling round with words to say that
this matter was determined by some inherent
defect in the Australian vision or by a flaw
in the mental equipment of the native son.
The root cause of what happened can be
divided into two parts. One was the failure
of Partv Government, the other the bungling
and cowardice of the politician. Party never
looked so rotten as when tint to the crucial
test of that hour nor the machine-made politi-
cian look so feeble and so dangerous. Every-
thing that followed and everything incidental
thereto can be traced to these sections of the
one thing. And in this can be included
“inability to visualise.” The politician
shirked looking at the war. Most of him
stuck his head in the sand. All of him parti-
cipated in a conspiracy to throttle anyone
who attempted to tell the truth about the
war. The air was filled with babbling drivel
about victory when nothing was more distant
or more uncertain. Defeats were turned into
triumphs. Impossible enterprises were con-
verted into accomplished feats. The public
was doped into insensibility, and everyone
who opened his mouth to protest against the
madness of this and to point to the inevitable
consequences found the Censor jumping down
his throat. Holman would get very much
nearer the retrospective bull’s-eye if his refer-
ences to Australia’s “inability” were changed
to Australia being officially prevented from
visualising the conflict. To some extent this
prevails even till to-day, for just as Aus-
tralians lived in a fool’s paradise about the
actual scrap they live' now in a haven for
maniacs about the national cashbox. As the
thing stands now, the distribution of “propa-
ganda” literature is neither going to correct
the mistakes of the past nor turn the edge of
present folly. The Bulletin has been ore-
sented with heaps of this literature. It is
good enough in its way, but none of it is Aus-
tralian. What the community needs most
now is information about the particular effects
of the war uoon Australia, about the stupen-
dous national problems that have been raised,
about the inescapable obligations that the
war has imposed Upon us all—and the conse-
mmuces of the politician and the Party outfits
falling in a disordered heap again. Will
Holman make a start by issuing a succinctly-
written pamphlet setting out the facts inci-
dental to overcoming the citizens’ inability to
visualise the significance of his conflicts with
Cohen ?
“Canuck” : As I forecasted long ago, the
policy of planting returned soldiers on mar-
ket-garden blocks round Melbourne has
proved itself a failure: firstly, because the
land selected was unsuitable, and, secondly,
because the market-gardener is made, not
born. Vic. Lands Minister Frank Clarke
lately admitted he had had to shift the

Never in such a hurry left the fight.

sible hope of their making a living thereon.
Possibly because he wasn’t asked Clarke

few miles away, on which the State War
Council built three neAv cottages—besides
the tA\’o existing ones. These three stood on
a part of the land which the former owner
never used, because it was no good to him,
and all three are now, and have for months,
been empty. The occupants are understood
to have got other blocks, but they haven’t
bad any compensation for the lost time and
discouragement. But the land-owner got
his encouragement. There Avas no blunder
made about that. Which seems a pity.
The Collapse.
The war news lately has been of the kind
that had previously been published in
dreams only. The Day—the Allies Day—
seems now to be definitely on the calendar.
From the Belgian coast to Verdun the enemy
F being badly battered, and in at least three
'daces threatened with disaster. The pro-
gress made up to the beginning of the week
around Cambrai required very little exten-
sion in order to disrupt the whole German
line to the northward. If the advance made
by the French and Americans further south
and round the corner is continued a few more
miles, Fritz is going to have his hands full
of more trouble than he ever thought could
be available in a helping. Laon, St. Quen-
tin and Cambrai are the hinges.of his gate,
and at all three places the Allies are working
like beavers. Meanwhile the occurrences
over beyond Salonika have been swift and
dramatic. The expedition thereabouts had
long been a conundrum. The British Gov-
ernment had often been denounced for hav-
ing anything to do Avith it. But the French
seem to have persisted in the importance of
the campaign, and, 10, it is from there that the
most sensational transactions have been heard
of. A successful attack last Aveek on the
Bulgarian position was followed by (1) an
appeal for an armistice, (2) the appearance
of Bulgarian delegates at the Allies’ head-
quarters, and (3) an announcement that
the Bulgars haAs agreed to down tools and
accept the peace terms offered them. Assum-
ing there is verification of the latter report
some quick changes in the general position
can be looked for. The problem of the Turk,
for instance. Avill be greatly simplified, the
back of his trousers being within immediate
reach, so to speak—that is, if he has any
trousers loft by now, a point on which there
seems some difference of opinion. The de-
fection of Bulgaria from the gang of burglars
would not only shut the Turk off from the
German, but AA r ould open a land bridge to
Roumania, and let the slip-panels down to
Russia, but would clear the way for the
development of unfriendliness to Austria
through Servia. If the Turk fell in a heap
the armies now penned down to Palestine
and Mesopotamia would be available for this
nurpose. Anyway, whatever happens it
looks reasonably certain that if Bulgaria
crawls to safety it will be up to the Turk
to do some hard thinking, and do it with
great rapidity. It is alleged that Germany
is “greatly perturbed” about the Bulgar;
that there has been a panic at Berlin; that
Von 14in den burg is going to “throw re-
serves” into the Balkans and hold the Bul-
gar down by the scruff of the nqpk. There
are also suggestions that Austria has been
inciting the Bulgar to quit, for the purpose,
presumably, of getting a lead to quit also.
On all these matters there will be addi-
tional illumination later on. But taking
everything into consideration it is now a
fair conclusion that the black spectre of
German domination need no longer be
feared: that this monstrous apparition is
doomed. Germany cannot win the war now.
The Allies can; and if the most recent
declaration by President Wilson is as good
a guide as this paper believes it to be the
Allies will, and win in a way that is real.
The contribution of Russia to the proceed-
ings in Europe continues to grow in horror
and futility. Hoavls for peace at any price
have been followed by yells for gore, and
the latest news describes a “red terror” and
Ivan butchering himself in thousands.
Trotsky and Lenin ought to be happv and
well-satisfied men.
The Fits of Fitzpatrick.
State Treasurer Fitzpatrick’, of N. S.
Wales, has been somewhat in the limelight of
late. He was one of the Ministers who re-
cently proudly requested that complainants
should point to specific items of extrava-
gance. This was difficult, seeing that feiv
people have access to the public accounts.
Still, one paper mentioned that a bouquet for
a singing lady, and a supper to an opera co.,
and a reception to the wife of a Federal
Minister, and a costly opening function for
the Zoo, and the public laying of the founda-
tion-stone of a brick cottage, and manv items
like that, looked petty and foolish and'waste-
ful ; also that they took up time which A\ r as
required for public business. Then Fitz-
Patrick' fell on his department and boasted
of some leakages he had,stopped, which only
suggested that he didn’t take the trouble to
properly attend to the job he was paid for
till the public harried him into it. Now a
Public Service Commissioner says brutally
that the Fitz crowd made 400 temporary
appointments to the civil service, and that
these were afterwards made permanent by
Act of Parliament, whereby the appointees
got into the service without passing the ex-
aminations required of the older hands. The
same Fitzpatrick says that in vieAv of the
paper shortage, which has been with us for
some years now, it is proposed to create
State-owned paper works. If they are man-
aged by experts with large powers, like the
Commonwealth Bank and the traffic branch,
of the railways (not the construction branch
which lays out lines to suit political in-
terests, and to concentrate all trade on the
place Avhere there is most trade and most
votes already), the idea is excellent. But
that sort of success supplies no limelight to
the politician except at the moment when the
affair is established. The permanent glory
goes to the management. Wherefore the
buzzing politician likes a system which
allows him to put his inexpert hand into
everything and be the god in the car, and if
the paper-mill is that kind of paper-mill, the
article it mills is likely to be scarce and dear
for a long time to come. Mr. Fitzpatrick'
has also told the public that no further State
taxation is proposed during the war. but all
sorts of things may happen afterwards. Cer-
tainly things may happen if the Federal sub-
sidy isn’t renewed after 1920. Still these
figures, beginning with the first year of Labor
Government, are interesting :
N. S. Wales Revenue from Taxation.
1910- . £1,027,519 1914-15.. £2,955,670
1911- 1,885,653 1915-16.. 3,117,221
1912- 1,405,360 1916-17.. 3,629,404
1913- 2,330,005 1917-18.. 3,967,102
So last year the State revenue from taxation
was £2,939,583 more than in the first year
Avhen Holman held office. If the amount
which the Government says it spent out of
revenue on war purposes is deducted it has
still about £2,500,000 or £2,600,000 extra
revenue to play with, and if the Federal sub-
sidy stopped right now, which is impossible,
it would even then be about £300,000 to the
good. Certainly the increased cost of living
has made a considerable increase of wages
necessary, but then a mere fraction of the in-
creases granted are properly chargeable to
taxation. The great bulk are additions to
the wages of people employed in the glorious
“permanent and reproductive” loan works,
and the “permanent and reproductive” works
—which are about 50 per cent, bigger and
more glorious than they were in 1910—are
expected to meet their own expenses and
even show a little profit. As for the neces-.
sary but non-revenue-producing services,
education is the biggest one, and it certainly
hasn’t got enough to make anv serious differ-
ence. Considering the neiy direct taxes
which have been put on, and the old ones
that have been increased, and the fact that
“permanent and reproductive” works have
been growing twice as fast as they ever grew
before, and “opening up the country” so that
one could hardly see its heels for dust, and
“developing the great natural resources” like
Ancient Henry —considering all this, some
people expected better things of Fitzpatrick'
than a threat of more taxes.

Webster’s Ships.
Postmaster-General Webster, who is a
rather despondent person, states that he has
little faith in air navigation as an affair of
the near future. For one thing, he reckons
that it is superfluous as a postman because
the inter-State mails are despatched after
business hours, and “by travelling at night
there is no loss of time in the delivery of
the mail carried.” The fact that airships
travel by night and even bomb cities by
night may have escaped his attention. Also
they sometimes travel three times a day.
And in saying that the inter-State mail-
trains don’t waste daylight (i.e., working)
hours he evidently thinks that the Sydney-
Melbourne and Melbourne-Adelaide mails are
the whole box and dice. Even theyuse upagood
deal of daylight. The Brisbane mail is Avorse
in this respect. And the mail-trains from 50 or
90 or 99 per cent, of N. S Wales, Victoria,
Queensland or S.A. to the same amount per
cent, of any other of these States, despite
the remarkable adjacency of the said States,
eat up .working hours and days amazingly.
Townsville and Melbourne are two important
business centres 11 hours apart as a fairly-
slow sky vehicle goes, or perhaps 15 hours
apart if inland mails are nicked up en
route instead of going round by Brisbane
and Sydney. And if Webster alleges that
the inter-State mail-train leaves Townsville
after business hours and just travels to Mel-
bourne during the niuht he is a stranger to
veracity, and the goddess that lived at the
bottom of a well isn’t in him. As for the
inter-State train from Newcastle to Hobart,
his statement is ridiculous. It is just
because of the. cumbersome habits of that
inter-State train, including the one from
Albany to Brisbane (Avhich places might
have a special airship put on to connect
with inward and outward steamers), that
people want Webster not to lose hope about
new things. Another insuperable objection
Webster finds is that the air-carriage of
mails in the U.S. costs Is. per ounce. Pos-
sibly his information is a trifle antiquated;
if it came by steamer to Sydney and then
reached Melbourne by a train running ex-
clusively in the hours of night it might be
delayed. Anyhoiv, life is moving fast and
moving all the time. A cablegram, which
started regardless of business hours and hur-
ried by a sea-bottom route Avhere it is always
night, reports that the very newest airship
is alleged to break all previous speed and
height records, and to do wonders in carry-
ing bombs, machine-guns and sundries in
addition to its crew. Anyhow, certain of the
Allied aircraft dropped 181 tons of explo-
sives and combustibles on the Hun in a single
spot one recent fine day, and if they cost Is.
per ounce freight the bill was £33,152 for
conveyance alone. The matter requires
looking into. Webster, by the way, says
that the U.S. is working with airships that
are not suited for war service, Avhich
probably means that they are too slow or
out of date for the fighting-line. It is im-
possible to judge men or ships or anything
else in war-time by the standard of those
that were left behind because they couldn’t
pass the medical examination. Once more
this paper urges the P.M.G. to keep his head
up.
A Man from the Middle of Things.
One Plowden, a missionary sort of person
Avho had spent five years around the Mac-
dcnnell Ranges, lately delivered a lecture in
Melbourne about the great natural resources
of that little-known knob or oasis in the
middle of the continent. It was an enthusi-
astic lecture and the case called for it. The
ranges have no railway as yet and only
Amry recently did they begin to have a smat-
tering of roads. The nearest line—the un-
finished transcontinental —ends at present
about 300 miles away. The next most adja-
cent one is a great deal farther away. The
place never had any political pull, because
the capital to which it naturally belongs is
Darwin—the smallest of the Australian capi-
tals except Canberra, and the only one, bar
Canberra, at which no Parliament ever sat.
There is a cool climate in the ranges, or
rather the tableland, because the place is
2000 or 3000 feet above sea level. Being
elevated it has a rainfall. There is a steady
rainfall north of it all the way to Darwin
as the tableland descends; that is to say,
there is a long stretch of country with from
10 to 20 inches per annum; then folloAv in
succession the 20-30 in., the 30-40 in. and
other belts, till the belt is reached when it
rains as a habit. The Macdonnell Ranges,
though on the place where the 10-20 in. belt
begins, have a greater fall of their, own. be-
cause of their knobby character. South of
them lies the long stretch of desert—it is
the custom noiv to say that Australia has
no desert, but a warm place where the rain-
fall varies from nil to lOin. in a year may
be called desert to save words—on the way
to Port Augusta and Adelaide, which is the
reason why the railway in that direction is
long in coming. East and south-east lie
stretches of desert on the roads to Brisbane,
Sydney and Melbourne, which is one reason
why the railways didn’t attempt to come;
another reason being the artificial State
boundaries. South-west lies the very, very
long stretch of desert on the way to' Pertli,
which is also a reason. The way has always
been clear for a line to Darwin, but the gold-
finds decided that Melbourne, Sydney, Bris-
bane and Adelaide should be the population
centres while the gold lasted, and dragged
pretty nearly all the people into a mere
corner _of the south-east. When the gold-
boom is dead the places with grass and
water Avill come into their own. There is a
strong suspicion of mineral deposits in the
centre of Australia; but being of all the
habitable regions the one that is farthest
from the coast it is the last to be carefully
prospected. The place has rivers of a sort
which could be dammed —the only rivers that
grow in the centre. The line from Port
Augusta to Darwin should have been finished
before the other transcontinental was
dreamt of. It is shorter than the line to
Perth; there was, when the question cropped
up, more construction done and less to do;
ic would open and give value to a vast
extent of Federal property, while the. Perth
line doesn’t open a road of Federal land;
also the new construction would run through
much more well-watered country and have
an oasis to prop it up in the middle. But
there was no Parliament at Darwin, as
there was at Perth, to hold up the other
end of the scheme, and no Bigjohn Forrest
from the Territory to clamor night and day
for the line to his particular State. The
Territory, being a Federal possession, isn’t
represented in the Australian Parliament,
and even if it was a Garden of Eden (which
it isn’t quite) an Eden with no representa-
tives isn’t in the running against anv sort
of place with 11 votes to dispose of.
Extracts from the report of the Imperial
Government Committee on the treatment by
the Huns of British prisoners of war behind
the firing-lines in France and Belgium
At the end of April, '1917, an agreement was defi-
nitely concluded between the British and German Gov-
ernments that prisoners of war should not on either
side be employed within 30 kilometres of the firing-
line. Nevertheless the German Command continued
so to employ their British prisoners under the
inhuman conditions stated in this report.... Two
instances are given in the evidence of men who
weighed 13 stone when captured. One was sent back
from the firing-line too weak to walk, weighing eight
stone only; when the other escaped to the British
lines his weight did not exceed that of his fellow
prisoner... .One instance is given of an Australian
private who, starving, had fallen out to pick up a
piece of bread left on the roadside by Belgian women
for the prisoners. He was shot and killed by the
guard.... “The German sergeant in charge at Ervil-
lers,” says one prisoner, “was very harsh. Twice' 1
saw him (this prisoner was there for a month only)
use a dog whip, and heard of him doing so on another
occasion. He used it mostly on men who were slow
in getting out to work owing to weakness”....
Many died behind the lines; all were thoroughly ill-
treated by the Germans and the lives of those who
did not die were mgde quite unbearable.
How long is Hunnish brutality to be quietly
suffered as a mere natural and inevitable
result of Hunnish education and character,
as though the Huns were poor heathen in
their blindness whom civilisation must
patiently endeavor to reform by strictly
abstaining from reprisals? To permit the
existing one-sidedness of barbarism to con-
tinue is merely to invite further ridicule
from the Germans in all classes of society.
Nothing is more ridiculous than strict observ-
ance of the rules of humanity in warfare
from a Hun point of view.
—
“0.K.”: Has the Avar produced a sorrier
scandal than the plaint of 8. A. Whiteman,
of Rabaul? Whiteman, the Britisher, is a
victim of the unsatisfactory “capture” of
German New Guinea that left the local
squareheads in complete control of its com-
mercial and social life. Before the war he
Avas a. prosperous merchant. Also, he was a
good patriot who thought he deserved well of
his country for directing the capture of the
yacht Komet, carrying one gun, which tin 1
local Huns kept in concealment in Talasea
Bay. Whiteman artlessly assumed that the
importance of Britishers would increase
rather than decline in German New Guinea
after its government had changed hands. No
ordinary man could have foreseen what came
to pass. German Nexv Guinea hauled down
the Hun flag to Australia on terms which
reduced the surrender to a transparent
farce. All that came to Whiteman for
being honestly and actively anti-German was
ruin. The treacherous Iluns, who had
reckoned it good policy to be on the most
friendly possible terms with him before the
war, didn't hesitate to be openly antagonistic
and bitterly vindictive as soon as they had
strengthened their position under the new
flag. They boycotted S. A. Whiteman, per-
secuted him, scoffed at him as a sillee stoopid
Britisher Avhose Government was afraid to
interfere vith der liberty of der all-poAverful
Shermans. ' Living in what, had become
nominally a British possession, Whiteman
was the sport of German arrogance and ani-
mosity. He was, and is, a shocking example
of what may happen to a loyal Britisher in
a British country controlled by Hunnish
Influence. The boycotted merchant is now
petitioning the Federal Parliament to grant
a full inquiry into all the circumstances of
the injustice he has suffered.
♦- —-—-
A judgment given last week by the High
Court ties the Federal Arbitration Court up
in a knot of which the size and shape may
take a long while to discover. The question
raised on a special case stated by Higgins
brought forward a simple constitutional
issue in relation to the Court. Briefly, the
finding of the High Court was (1) that the
Commonwealth possessed power to delegate
arbitral authority to the Arbitration Court:
but (2) that the Commonwealth had no
power to give the Court authority to enforce
awards. The meaning of this is that, while
the Arbitration Court might make awards, it
possessed no authority to impose penalties
for breaches thereof, nor, apparently, any
right to see whether anyone took notice of
them. The full judgments’have not. yet been
published. Wherefore the comments of laiv-
yers, politicians and others on the subject
ate merely speculative. The theory is put
forward that the legal situation created by
the judgment can be met by proceedings for
breach of Federal awards being instituted in
Small Debt Courts. There is something
bizarre about this, anyway. If it should
prove to. be correct, The Bulletin would
not be disposed to look with any great hope-
fulness to the future of arbitration on that
basis. It looks more than probable that the
effect of the judgment might be to throw the
Federal Court out of action and transfer all
the work to the State tribunals until such
time as an amendment to the Constitution
can be put together—a doubtful hope. Legal
discoveries about the Constitution up to date
raise a strong suspicion that even then
another fatal aperture would be discovered
at the opportune time.

A five-nights’ revival of “Potash anti Perl-
mutter’' ends at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) to-
night. The brisk business comedy came out
of the J.C.W. play-filing cabinet looking as
good as new. and, with one or two exceptions,
the players handled it satisfactorily. Jas. Iv.
Waters made a strong appeal as Abe Potash,
the kindly senior partner of the Jewish cloth-
ing firm; and Nick Adams was close to
nature as the vigorous, bullying junior mem-
ber of the firm who made poor old Abe wish
he could'be as independent as his own office-
boy. Rosie I’arkes (one of the group of
theatrical sisters) scored a success as Ruth
Goldman, the high-salaried dress-designer
whose expert touch made the somewhat,
dowdy P. and P. costumes bound up in
value. This Australian girl has a fine stage
presence, but she is handicapped by a weak
speaking voice. The Royal Comics will
appear in “Katinka” on Saturday night at
the theatre.
“The Man Who Came Rack" continues to
find himself well treated at the Criterion
(Sydney). Anyway, he has not yet men-
tioned moving off, and the management have
added matinees to his week’s work.
“The Invisible Foe” who guides Emelie
Polini to the right volume of Dickens will
cease haunting the Bransby library after
Friday night, October 11, so the people who
like spook plays have only a week in which
to appear before the ticket-office of_ the
Palace (Sydney) and produce some visible
money. “The Eyes of Youth,” said to be
highly successful in N’York, is due on Satur-
day, October 12.
“Pierrot Pie No. 5” is to be opened at the
Playhouse (Sydney.) by carver Sydney,James
on Friday. It will contain “The Man Who
Wouldn’t Come Back,” a burlesque on the far-
travelled Muriel Starr play which grows foot-
sore at the Criterion every evening, little
Cecil Haines, who did so well in “The Mas-
querader,” will do some imitations, and Mar-
jorie Hammond (soubrette) has been added
to the eo.
Jack Waller publishes the second edition
of “Vanity Fair” at the Tivoli (Sydney) on
Saturday. For the music-lover this is one
of the likeliest shows in town.
The Lyceum (Sydney) screen is shrivel-
ling beneath the heat of Theda Bara’s inter-
pretation of Dumas’ “Camille.” The Bara
poses have lost nothing of their old grace,
and have gained in forcefulness. The dura-
tion of her kisses breaks all previous records ;
and the tears of the house at the lady’s
tragic finish are only dried when George
Walsh starts laughter spinning in “Brave
and Bold.” At Hoyt’s and the Haymarket
“The Invisible Foe ,”

Harmon Lee as

Sessue Hayakawa
is the jealous and
the hot-angered
man who believes
that “The Honor
of Ilis House” lies
in the dust. Across
the same sheet
Pauline Frederick,
with a host of bad
companions, flits in
an allegorical role as
“Madam Jealousy,"
but she is brought
low by the .all-
powerful film asset
—the baby. Con-
stance Talmadge
(“The Studio
Girl”) calls in at
the Crystal Palace
for her supper of
life’s cakes and ale.
This time she runs
away from aunty
and a country
sweetheart to a
studio and an
artist in New Yoi'k
city. But she avoids the right turning,
and marries the artist. She was a nice girl,
too. and deserved better luck. “Every-
woman's Husband," at the Empress, has
been a big draw during the week, and at
the Strand “The llrass Check" has been
keeping the box-office girls busy.
Adelaide has had a week of mixed melo-
drama. The advantage lay with “The
Rosary” at the Royal. The brisk play
was well staged, the officers’ dinner and
the duel being particularly well put on.
Wilkie, heartily farewelled, expressed a hope
of getting back to Shakspeare and Sheridan
on his next visit. He had fine support from
Inman. Hunt, Vivian Edwards, Henry Dore
(who has the makings of a second Leslie
Victor), Miss Hunter-Watts and Nellie
Ferguson (who now moves over to the
Tivoli, where melodrama is to continue).
The “Two Orphans,” revived there, is show-
ing its age. The long-drawn scenes of
misery for blind girl and cripple are not so
much to the taste of this age as they are
known to have been to that of 1870. Blanche
MacPherson and Ida Gresham are the two
heroines, and Maud Goldspink gets right out
of her usual line as the old hag. Fitzherbert
is a notable villain, but Guy Hastings
does not seem happy in the part of the
crippled hero. At the Majestic, Sahera puts
up a thought-reading turn, Nikola continues
to hand out his own line of magic, and one
more revue co. has come in to provide half
the programme—Paul Stanhope’s. At West’s
the filmed “Milestones” shows the advantages
of screen over stage, bringing in the Prince
Consort and Dickens and the omnibus _ and
other pieces of local color (including an iron-
clad launching), for most of which there is
no room behind the footlights. Wondergrapli
is attracting inside business with Hazel
Dawn in “The Saleslady,” and in the open
air with Douglas Fairbanks “Headin’
South.” At the Pav. the late O. Henry and
Chaplin score in their respective ways.
“Oh, Oh, Delphine!” leaves Her Majesty’s
(Melb.) to-night to make room for “Oh,
Boy!” which is being transferred from the
Royal to provide a vacancy for “Business
Before Pleasure,” the new helping of Potash
and Perlmutter that is promised for Satur-
day. “Oh, Boy!” should settle down to a
long life in its new home. Maud Fane
remains the pride of the show, and in most
situations she is markedly so by contrast
with her male supporters. For the arduous
job of diverting the multitude an actress
never had a more hopeless set of accomplices
than William Greene, Alfred Frith and Fred
Maguire—Maguire especially.
Until to-morrow the scowl of Ned Duggan
will hang heavily over the drama of “What
Happened to Mary.” On Saturday, however,
the stage sky will clear at the King’s (Melb.)
and the sunshine of Steele Rudd’s humor will
gleam afresh in “.McClure and the Parson.
Barry Lupino continues to be apparently
indispensable to almost every situation in
“Honi Soit” at the Tivoli (Melb.). The
same old foggy utterance is heard behind
innumerable disguises in a tireless reitera-
tion of aged wheezes eight times a week.
There is hardly anything in the show but
Barry, and there is often little in Lupino
but show. If he would suppress himself a
trifle and allow other people to express
themselves. “Honi Soit” would be more like a
revue and less like a personal explanation.
Leila Doubleday gave another concert at
the Auditorium (Melb.) last night, and she
will appear on Saturday in an extra pro-
gramme of particular attractiveness. _ This
time the accomplished young fiddler is sup-
ported by a previously unheard of soprano,
Constance Neville Johns.
Hoyt’s Melbourne advts. shower superla-
tives on “The Woman God Forgot,” the new
eight-act play depicting incidents in the
Spanish invasion of Mexico, which were un-
dreamt of by Prescott or any other his-
torian. The film, in which Geraldine
Farrar fills the star role, is remarkable for
the producer’s efforts to reconstruct the
salient features of Aztec civilisation; and
for the spectacular backgrounds of a
garish love story. He has piled pomp on
splendor Avith a lavish hand. Elsewhere
Hoyt’s are screening Sessue Hayakawa in
“The Honor of His House” and June
Caprice in “A Camouflage Kiss.” The Jap
actor appears in a tragedy of _ love and
poison, whereas June’s little diversion is
more in the nature of postman’s knock.
Current divinities at the Majestic (Melb.)
are Alice Brady, in “The Whirlpool,” and
Alma Reubens, in “The Painted Lily.” Alma
suggests a gilded Auolet more than a painted
lily, but her good looks and fine clothes over-
come the effect of any physical discrepancy.
The heroine of “The Whirlpool” looms tragi-
cally as the glittering decoy of a gambling
den. The usual innocent abroad ivanders
into her vicinity, and, just as in 5000 similar
films, finds a life imprisonment in the frail
lady’s long, white arms. Alice, however, is
an especially attractive siren, so the A'ictim
in this case can be excused.
“Tlie Dingo”: Somebody should stir up
Pearce again in connection with the passing
of unfit recruits for active service. On the
boat in which I recently returned to Aus-
tralia, nearly 50 per cent, of the heroes on
board were men who had never been further
than England. They had been passed here
as physically fit, but immediately on arrival
in England were ticketed unfit and marked
for home. The fitting-out and transporting
of these men cost about £2OO per head. Thus
our 300 “tourists” meant a dead loss of
£60,000. That's how to make war less
expensive! Of course, the examining
medico is not to blame every time; in some
cases the severity of the English climate
breaks the health of men who were fit
enough in Australia. But many of the men
have been “tourists” since the early days,
hiding glaring disabilities, until they got
near where all the bother is, and then artisti-

and Barry Lupino).
cully crumpling up. They are sent home and
discharged; but free travel agrees with them,
so they are soon up for another medical
examination, are passed by a doctor and
go forward again. Unfortunately the evil is
growing worse; that is why men who have
been through the mill and are marked for
home have often to wait six months for a
boat—the steamers are crowded out by those
who have never been past Salisbury -Plains.
The scientists and naturalists of S. Aus.
have made one more attempt to get the State
Government to set aside the western end of
Kangaroo Island, about 1000 square miles, as
a fauna and flora reserve. Professor Stirling
and Captain S. A. White were the chief
speakers on a deputation to Harwell. Attor-
ney-General. They assured him that the
island would be his monument if kept free
for the forms of life rapidly becoming
extinct on the mainland. Robins, a timber
expert, added that 48,000 acres of softwoods,
carefully tended, might be worth 11 mil-
lions to" S.A. in 30 years’ time. Barwell was
sympathetic, but not encouraging. The Con-
servator of Forests has reported against the
island as a timber area ; also, said Barwell,
the land asked for was not so useless for
sheep, or for closer settlement, as the depu-
tation suggested ; and, finally, the island
being too large and in parts too occupied
to be set apart, the present cost of 25 miles
of wire-netting fence seemed to block the
scheme.
“Simon” : P.M.G. Webster means to make
a few extra coppers for his department
somehow*. Nowadays, owing to ordinary
freight difficulties, the parcel’s post is much
used in business circles. One of the con-
ditions is that the parcels have to be removed
within three days, after which a stiff
demurrage is exacted. Lately the Customs
have passed very stringent regulations re-
quiring consignees to prove that they are
entitled to land goods under the one-twelfth
of former year provision. All this takes
much longer than the time-limit, and as
Webster w r on’t hand over until the entries
are presented in regular order, the act of
collecting toll under the circumstances
would shame Ned Kelly, but it doesn’t deter
Webster’s band.
“F.H.J.” : “F.’s” difficulty about the con-
tradictory nature of air-figliting reports (B.
12/9/T8) is easily explained by the fact
that the ’planes retrieved by the Germans,
though shot dow*n, are not reported lost in
their official communiques. Therefore, as
most of the fighting occurs behind the Ger-
man lines, they recover a majority of their
fallen ’planes and their account of their
losses appears ridiculously low, and as they
give no credit to the Allies for a like recov-
ery the Allies’ total appears correspondingly
high. The German official communique—
“We shot down in July 518 machines, of
which 239 are in our possession. We lost
129 machines” —must, therefore, be inter-
preted that of 518 Allied machines shot
down, 239 fell behind the German lines and
279 behind the Allies lines; and of German
’planes shot down, 129 were irretrievably
lost to them, as they fell behind the Allies’
lines. This is, of course, their count; but
their claim that they crashed 279 machines
behind the Allies’ lines is absurd, inasmuch
as only 129 of theirs are admitted
the same territory in the same period. The
Huns make no report on their machines fall-
ing behind their own lines, for the wreckage
is recovered, and therefore, in German logic,
not lost. The pilots don’t count.
The Adelaide policeman does things in a
polite and gentlemanly way. He has been
deeply dissatisfied with his rate of pay for
a long time, and now finds that he can t
continue the fight with the cost of living on
the old terms. But he doesn’t strike. No.
He just sends in notice that he will be
resigning at the end of the month. Anyone
has a right to do that; but, as these resigna-
tions are coming in by the hundred (and as.
incidentally, any man retiring can draw two-
thirds of his past contributions to the pen-
sion fund), the Government is sitting up
and reaching for a cold-water bandage tor
its fevered brow.
Senator Pearce put the acid on a guberna-
torial jokelet at the Agricultural Show in
Melbourne the other day. He read out a
new item of war news concerning the Allies
capture of a cave containing 1000 bottles ol
champagne and other liquors. Governor
Stanley chipped in, “Not a dry show, that.
which passed, of course, as a very humor-
ous interjection—coming from an Excellency.
Then Pearce suggested: “Perhaps the fact
that it was not a dry show accounted for the
ddMole" Seeing that the Show committee
had barred on the grounds the sale of intoxi-
cants as a war-time policy, Pearce’s sug-
gestion was tactful and reasonable, whereas
Stanley’s comment was an insignificant and
ill-considered joke.
A S. Aus. Court has been asked to decide
whether a magpie remains a fully-protected
bird when he makes a public nuisance ol
himself. It was proved that this one had
made a suburban road, near his nest, absolutely
unsafe for passers-by, so fierce was his
determination that nobody should come near
his family. When he invaded a garden and
attacked an unoffending infant the kid’s
parent fetched a gun. The Bench decided
that protection is absolute; but, as the bird
had fairly asked for it, the fine for his
assassination was entered at ss. instead of
£lO.
“C.G.”: The Aussies have won much
kudos wherever the followers of Ananias
foregather, but sometimes we have to tip
our lids. Here’s the yarn spun us the
other evening by a half-caste Lahore Div.
artilleryman from Delhi —a professional sol-
dier since the age of 14: —
It was in the hill country, where the Pathans
were giving trouble. I went out one night with our
adjutant, the orderly-sergeant and a Ghurka, to go
round the sentries. The Ghurka, he stop suddenly,
listen, and then, quick as lightning throw his kukri.
Turing to the adjutant, lie say, “Come quick, I show
you,” and we follow and find the hillman dead with
ithe kukri half through his head !
Followed a moment’s silence, and then the
usual “mug” bit. “Can the Ghurkas see in
the dark?” he asked. “Ob, no,” said our
friend from Delhi; "the Ghurka, he cannot
see in the dark, especially when the hillman
over 100 yards away. The Ghurka he smell
the cheetah fat the hillman grease himself
with and he throw his kukri at the smell.”
“Bill Bowyang”: It happened in a N.Q.
sugar township in the days when the local
gaol was a big log placed in the sergeant's
back yard. Bill Smith, “gun” cane-chopper
and grass-fighter, was enjoying the final
stages of a week’s jamboree when the John
Hop fell on him, conveyed him to the log
and chained him. Two hours later the ser-
geant again visited the pub and was aston-
ished to see Smith standing in the bar accom-
panied by the log. The policeman was a
sport and an admirer of physical strength.
“Look here, Smith,” he said, “if you can carry
that log back to my yard, I’ll let you go.”
“Right.” said Bill, “let’s have a couple of
beers first.” Eventually the log was re-
turned to its official position and Smith
returned to the pub to inquire about some
more beer. Two months afterwards a con-
stable with a pugilistic reputation was trans-
ferred to the township. His first trouble
was Smith, returning home at midnight with
a full cargo. Approaching the gay spirit the
Hop said: “Look here, Smith, you’re not
a bad sort at times, but I’m going to arrest
you. To give you a fair deal I’ll fight
you, and if you win I’m done with you."
At the end of the tenth round a much-
battered policeman borrowed the Shire Coun-
cil’s wheelbarrow to convey Smith to the
lockup. A couple of days back both men
met in the trenches in the Jordan Valley
here in Palestine. That’s how I heard the
yarns.

‘‘Net profit for period ended June 30, 1018,
£77,504 10s.”—so say the directors. And
this sum to a penny is swallowed up by the
10 p.c. dividend. But by going back to last
year’s accounts it will be found that in addi-
tion to this “net profit” big round sums have
been added to reserves —£80,000 to insur-
ance reserve and £50,000 to a reserve for re-
pairs, renewals and replacements. Hence
the £207,504 shown in the table. It is worth
while going back a couple of years to see
how these reserves have grown:—
1915. 1918. Increase.
Insurance reserve ... £45,000 £225,000 £lBO,OOO
Iteserves for renewals, etc. 112,500 300,000 187,000
So £367,500 has been added, while a
further £lOO,OOO has been set aside for a
provident account. Thus since June, Ul5.
amounts equivalent to over 60 p.c. of the paid-
up capital have been voted into these re-
serves and the provident fund alone. And
there are other methods of stuffing away
profits if a shipping co. feels inclined that
way. For instance, a co., if it wishes to
withhold some of its profits from curious
eyes, may allow more than necessary allow-
ance for the depreciation of its fleet. What
allowance is being made in this case The
Bulletin has no idea. Steamers, hulks,
plant, properties, wharves, shares, in other
cos. and some Government securities are in
one big heap nowadays, and how much of
the heap represents the fleet: there’s not even
a hint. Anyhow, though there are U-boats
and other new dangers lurking in the seas
nowadays, the shipping eos. are having a
vi rv fat time. Last year, the Echunga
(4589 tons) was torpedoed, the little Inves-
tigator (605 tons) was wrecked, and the
tug Brimawarr went down during the
Mackay cyclone. But the co.’s accounts
show no seal’s.
Owing to the inclusion of investments and
Government securities among the shipping
and other property item it is impossible to
give a tabled comparison of. the balance-
sheet figures of any value. This much, how-
ever, is visible: in 1914 the. co. owed
£459,905 and had more or less liquid assets
amounting to £108.497. showing an
of liabilities over liquid assets of £351.408.
At June 30 last liabilities amounted to
£384.336 (exclusive of the provident fund),
while liquid assets, in addition to. the fixed
deposits, shares in other cos., Government
securities hidden among the slapping pro-
perty, . etc., amounted to £600.277. showing
a surplus of liquid assets of ,£215.941. The
big composite item at £1,212.903 shows an
increase of £2BBB over the figures of four
years ago. The reason why some of the
cash assets are thrown in among the fixed
property is no doubt due to the sale of some
of the vessels during the past year or so.
It has been a rather dazzling record. For
several years prior to the war the co. had
been adding extensively to its fleet —it had
even got ahead of the immediate require-
ments of the inter-State trade —and in doing
so the co. had piled up its indebtedness. As
has been shown the sale of several of the
vessels—at inflated war prices—has changed
the whole appearance of the accounts. No
doubt, if the co. had to replace these steam-
ships now it would have to pay perhaps even
more inflated prices. Exactly what is the
true net profit the Adelaide S.S. Co. is mak-
ing it is quite impossible to tell. There
is not even an indication of the amount the
co. has been called upon to pay for War-
time Profits tax. and since no Profit and
Loss account is published, any idea of how
well the co. is doing is confined to watching
the growth of the balance-sheet figures. But
another interesting comparison is that the
1914 profits were made with a fleet of 29
steamships with a total tonnage of 83 050
tons (exclusive of tugs, steam tenders, hulks
and lighters) ; the past year s profits have
been made with a fleet ot 22 steamers of
a total tonnage of 64,758 tons. No vessel
was apparently sold during the year, and,
previously mentioned} tlie iiiChun^ci.
requisitioned by the Admiralty, was tor-
pedoed, and the Investigator was wrecked.

Until recently there were two banks with
their headquarters ilk the Speck, but the
National was taken under the wing ot tne
Commercial of Australia a few months ago.
The Commercial of Tas. is the second-oldest
Australasian bank, and it is a nice, com-
fortable little business with 16 branches and
a couple of receiving offices distributed over
the island. Lately the Speck has been
doing very well with its tin, copper, wool,
•jam and so on, and, though it has not felt
the effects of the loan boom to anything like
the extent of the other States, everything
has been going very nicely. 1 ive years ago
£25.000 of new capital was got in (at a
premium of 100 p.c.), and gross profits have
grown from £33,416 for the six months to
Aug., 1913, to £36.125 for the similar term
last year, and to £43,706 for the past ball-
year.’ However, there’s nothing very fat
about this bank’s figures, for the gross profit
for the past year represent only about 16 p.c.
ou the shareholders’ funds, while the net
profits equal only a little over 8 p.c, oi the
funds. Though the 14 p.c. dividend looks
very nice, it is really only a return ot 6 p.c.
on capital and reserves.
The balance-sheet figures show these
changes' in five years: —

but there is about £178,000 more out m ad-
vances now. Of the £1,169,009 belonging to

liquid form, there is £1.615,577 m advances,
besides £62.945 in premises. I his strength
is due to the fact that for every £1 of share-

This is another local industry which has been
given a big lift by the war; but the rapid
growth of the -Barnet Glass co. has also been
due - to the management’s fortune in having
got itself into a good position for expansion
before the rush of business set in. The co.
was formed in 1908 with a paid-up capital ot
£25,000 to take over the business of Barnet
Glass and Co., £12,500 apparently having
been paid for the assets of the old co. By
1914 paid-up capital had been trebled, and
consisted of 52,500 8 p.c. cum. prefs. of £1
fully paid and 22.500 ords. fully paid to £l.
There was no goodwill. Early that year the
co. decided to reconstruct, chiefly with a view
to getting in more capital. For a start, two
shares in the new co. were exchanged for
each of the old ords. and £22,500 was in-
cluded among the assets to represent good-
will. Then 52,500 ordinary shares were
offered at. par. Four months later the war
■ started, and thus the co., which had a live
management, was well placed to meet the
altered conditions. Everything has worked
out very well, and not only has all but
£8742 oi the £50,000 uncalled capital after
the reconstruction been got in, but the busi-
ness has grown so big that the management
has had to increase its loans on mortgages,
etc., by £26,78.6 since 1915, while the amount
owing' to sundry debtors, which includes
money on deposit, has been increased by
£39,511 in the three, years.
The balance-sheet figures have thus ex-
panded rapidly:—
1915. 1917. 191 S.
Liabilities ..£‘46,076 £113,984 £138,212
Freeholds . . 21,297 33,194 30,702
Plant, etc. .. 30,942 53,432 58,969
Book debts .. 49,918 09,322 81,443
Stock . . . . 74,591 181,845 222,239
Cash, etc. . . 8,789 6,600 10,993
So there is now in stocks alone over £30,000
in excess of the paid-up capital. Since 1915
£49,306 of new capital has been got in, and
liabilities have increased by £92,136, total
£141,442. The whole of this increase is more
than represented by additions to stocks; so
after paying handsome dividends—though
shareholders have not been by any means
greedy—sufficient profit has been left in the
business to add £9405 to freeholds, £22,027 to
plant, £2204 to War Loan and cash, etc.,
and enable the co. to carry £31,525 more
book debts, while accumulated profits also
represent £6206 of stocks in excess of that
represented by the increase in capital and
liabilities, as shown above. It is certainly a
very fine record, and an object-lesson to the
tariff-shirking politicians of what Australian
brains and labor can do if given a chance.
The gross trading profit lias increased from
£84,070 in 1915 to £162,332 for the past
year; and expenses have grown from
£64,467 to £114,179—£50,000 a year more
that is being paid to Australian workmen,
clerks, etc., to help the income of printers,
insurance offices, 4te., to help Webster’s Post
Office, the Federal and State Treasurers, and
so on—all money, most of which in addition
to the profits would go to people in other
countries When we buy the imported article.
There is not the slightest doubt that the
Commonwealth should be manufacturing the
whole of the rubber goods it requires.
Rubber plantations are right at its doorstep.
As to the future, this co. is in practically the
same position as a number of other Aus-
tralian industries which have been helped by
the war. The Federal Parliament has so far
shown no inclination to give our industries
adequate Protection before the rush comes.'
yet its noisy Freetrade leader has been
'careering around Britain preaching the tre-
mendous benefits of Protection.

This co. was bred in the Q. N. Bank stable.
It was one of the properties which this bank
had thrown on its hands after the big' smash.
But as it is not the business of a bank to
grow cane and mill it. this co. was launched
eight years ago, and from time to time the
Q. N. Bank has sold some of its shares, often
at a premium, and strengthened its own posi-
tion. However, the bank is still strongly in-
terested in the Millaquin. general-manager
Ralston being managing director, and he is
accompanied at Board meetings by two other
Q.N. directors. The last sugar season was
the best Bananaland lias ever had —a bumper
harvest which realised high prices, Profits
were thus twice as much as in the previous
year, which had been full of trouble for the
industry.
During the first year of this co., it,acquired
the Hummock and Windermere plantations
from the Bank of N. S. Wales for £75.500,
and put itself into dgbt; but this indebtedness
has been gradually worked off. This shows
the balance-sheet movements since the co.’s
first year : —•
1912. 1917. 1918.
Liabilities £111,660 £81,784 £177,260

Sundry debtors .. .. 38,600 42,526 45,493
Cash and investments . . - 58,955 43,898
The big increase in liabilities at June 30 last
is accounted for by an overdraft of £138,055
to finance the exceptionally heavy stocks the
co. was carrying—£l94,93l worth of sugar
syrups, treacles and molasses, compared with
only £12,521 at June 30, 1917. However, the
surplus of more or less liquid assets over lia-
bilities six years ago was £50,195: at June
30 last it had been increased to £141,810.
But £50.000 of the reserves shown in the
first table are set aside in a depreciation and
renewals account; so portion of the reserves
may not be true reserves, and consequently
some of the profits shown may not be true
profits. What the co. writes off for depreeia-
tion, apart from this allowance {£lo.ooo for
the past year), is not stated. And to secure
an idea of the actual progress the co. is mak-
ing, this matter of depreciation is a big factor.
In view of the bitter experience the Q. N.
Bank had in the long-ago, however, it is more
than probable that the Millaquin Board is
making at least adequate allowance. The
good time the co. had last year permitted the
directors to hand out a 10 p.c. dividend to
shareholders as a sort of compensation for
the 6 p.c. of the previous year: but the
management does not reckon on being able to
maintain the increased rate. However, on
present prospects and with ordinary luck and
freedom from labor troubles, it anticipates
being able to return S p.c. p.a. on its paid-up
capital of £500,000.

This co.’s annual report is not a very talka-
tive affair: no Profit and Loss account is
published, and the balance-sheet is limited to
four entries on the liabilities side and a simi-
lar number of entries 'to show the assets.
Exactly bow the profit of £10,027 was arrived
at The Bulletin does not know. But these
are dull times compared with the recent years
of construction boom, and besides the diffi-
culty in securing building materials from
overseas last year the co.’s business was
affected by the big strike. Until only a few
years ago a lot of capital was invested in
properties, as this table shows:—-•

The management decided, that it did not re-
quire most of these properties, and they have
been gradually unloaded in a favorable
market. The proceeds from their sale now
being available, ss, per share is being returned
to snareholders, reducing the paid-up capital
to £llO,OOO. After this return of capital,
shares will be paid to 10s., so it has been
decided to reduce the number of shares by
half and make them £1 fully paid up. Tin*
whole of the reduced capital of £llo,oop and
£29,011 besides is in the one item,. “Sundry
debtors, cash and shares in other cos.” What
is actually in that mixture this paper does
not know; and the “shares in other cos.” may
mean quite a lot. However, there is £lO,OOO
in War Loan besides, so if the “shares in
other cos.” can continue to produce a satis-
factory return, in all weathers, shareholders
should be able to get a bite if even duller
times lie ahead of the building trade, which is
not at all unlikely. However, Goodlet and
Smith is in a much better position than it
was a few years ago to face any troubles
that may happen along. Besides haying
worked off its unnecessary properties, it has
well written down its plant, and its stocks
are not of a size that will give it much
trouble if the worst happens. Otherwise, as
mentioned above, much depends on what is
in the big composite item among the assets.

That tables gives the history of this old-
established co. since the late E. H. Lasceiles
invited clients to take up shares. Mr. Lasceiles
had been 50 years in the business, which had
been growing very nicely, and it was consid-
ered that with more capital it could be still
further extended. But the co. had the mis-
fortune to have been launched at a bad time.
A record drought hit the parts of Victoria
where it was chiefly interested, and the stock
losses not only affected current profits but
also its immediate prospects. So though
according to the elaborate prospectus—a
model in prospectuses for its information and
its candor —net profits for the seven years to
dune, 1912, averaged £13,198 per annum, for
the past six years they have averaged only
£12.062 on the increased capital. However,
gradual recovery is being made, as will he

The approach of summer makes it imperative for
every stock-owner to give a thought to the purifica-
tion of drinking water for his stock. If he is content
to let them drink muddy, slimy water he cannot
expect them to keep in good condition. All over the
State careful stock-owners are using Aluminoferric in
the proportion of one pound to every 2000 gallons of
water. It ensures pure liquid water in dams, wells
tanks, etc., at very low cost, by precipitating ali
impurities and leaving the water clear and pure
free from any ingredient injurious to man or beast
Let us go into details telling you hovfr it will be to

£38,658; 1918, £43,192. The wool-clip
handled by the eo. is still under what it
used to be; for 1912 the old co. handled
51,728 bales, and owh.g to the effect of the
drought the figures for 1916 had been re-
duced to 32,274 bales, but last year there was
a recovery to 47,836 bales, while, owing to the
splendid prices being paid, the co. no doubt
got a nice cut in commissions. Net profits
for the past 12 months were reduced some-
what by writing off £3492 of bad debts and
by a 10 p.c. bonus on salaries to the staff.
Capital is £150,000, 150,000 shares of £l,
• >O,OOO of which were issued in payment for
the goodwill of the old business (which ex-
plains the “deficit” column in the first table).
Besides its own money the co. is working on
a bank overdraft of £37,589, and owes sundry
creditors £33,956. On the other side there
are freeholds, £75,302; plant, etc.,' £2076;
stocks, £2248; advances and book debts,
£97,467; cash arid odds and ends, £2340;
and £5OOO is invested in a motor-car business,
which is now being closed down. There is
no doubt about the future of the country in
which this co. operates; and as two-thirds of
the shares are held by clients there should be
an assured turnover. But profits . depend
entirely on good management, the seasons
and the state of the markets.
Y-Water, Emmaville (N.S.W.) is pushing
ahead to get into the better ground shown in
Arthur Moline’s old sampling of the half
of the claim yet unsluiced. The plant as
overhauled does the trick in efficiency and
cheapness of costs, but the tin contents of
the wash couldn’t stand the use of explo-
sives freely, so a short cut has been taken
to a richer and easier area. Helped by the
high price of tin the old £14,000 overdraft is
melting away, the last clean-up reducing
the debt to about the £2OOO mark., If the
co continues to do as well a war-time levy
will have to be paid, unless Treasurer Watt’s
proposed amendments of the Act cover the
case of shows like the Y-Water, which have
had to toil for three or four years to get
profits out of poor ground. There was a
time when the co. shelled out 6s. per annum
for awhile, and Collins House is credited
with hanging on to the show because it
believes in a second advent of the happy
profit-paying era.

Cadia, in the western part of the Bathurst
(N.S.W.) mining district, is coming to life
again. Hoskins, Ltd., of Lithgow, are now pre-
paring to work a big iron deposit there. The
line from Spring Hill to the field has reached
the final stage, and gangs are at work break-
ing the stone in a number of cuts. An aerial
line will carry the ore across the valley, a
distance of three-quarters of a mile, to the
terminus of the railway. The copper-mine
which closed down early last year is now
also seriously considering making another
attempt.

The Kingsgate molybdenite and bismuth
show, in the Ne.w England district (N.S.W.),
has been running its mill intermittently.
From July 25 to August 21 96 tons ore were
treated for concentrates valued at £544. Bis-
muth concentrates are valued at 3s. 3d., and
at 4s. per lb. Molybdenite mills
in N. S. Wales and Queensland are gradu-
ally improving recoveries, and the Wonbali,
at Mt. Perry (Q.), has been retreating its
own tailings for a return of 15s. to 20s. per
ton.
There is a mild boom in the Tumut
and Gundagai districts (N.S.W.). The cop-
per show at Mt. Hart is said to be looking-
promising, and some extra special ore has
been tapped lately. Some rich gold speci-
mens were recently obtained from a leader
about five miles from Tumut; and the Gun-
dagai Long Tunnel and Pox’s show, at
Ooolac, are, according to reports, likely to
shortly turn out a lot of bullion.
Of the hundred-odd mines and so-called
mining ventures originally floated at Ival-
goprlie, barely a dozen remain. Many came
to grief almost right away, but others went
on until mercifully prevented by the slump
which followed the boom. For years after,
however, new flotation schemes were con-
tinually being put forward by London pro-
moters for absorbing worthless mines, and
unfortunately for the public a number suc-
ceeded. Dummy directors prophesied hand-
some dividends in the near future, and the
game of humbug went on until funds gave
out or someone told the truth. All that
was left after the first collapse were the
Hannan’s Star, Boulder Deep Levels,
Boulder Main Reef, Chaffers, Golden Links,
Lake View .South, Lake View, Boulder Per-
severance, Golden Horseshoe, Great Boulder,
Tvanhoe, Ivanhoe South Extended, Hainault,
Kalgurli, South Kalgurli, Associated, Asso-
ciated Northern, North Kalgurli, Oroya
Brownhill, Brownhill Extended, and at north
end Hannan’s Reward, Mt. Charlotte, Golden
Zone, Hannan’s North, and, later, the Hidden
Seci-et and a number of lesser lights. By
manipulating the tonnage to bring the output
per ton up to the standard which everyone
looked for in those days, and not caring a
hang about costs, some of these concerns
managed to keep the market moving for a
time, others kept their mid up by crushing®
from picked ore, while others again flour-
ished on press putt's until the bailiff came
along. A few shows passed into the hands
of neighboring cos., and in two or three
notable cases others, as a result of capable
development and the discovery of gold in
previously unsuspected places, were turned
to profitable account. The survivors now
are: The Lake View and Star (comprising
the old Lake View, Lake View South, Han-
nan’s Star, Boulder Deep Levels, Boulder
Main Reef and Chaffers, Golden Horsehoe,
Great Boulder, Ivanhoe (including the
Ivanhoe South Extended), Associated, South
Ivalgurli (which includes the Ilainault),
Boulder Perseverance (in liquidation and
under tribute), Associated Northern and
North Ivalgurli (also under tribute), Kal-
gurli, Oroya Links (in which the old Brown-
hill, Brownhill Extended, Oroya Blocks and
Golden Links are absorbed), and, at the
north end, Hannan’s Reward. Take away
the Golden Horseshoe, Ivanhoe and that
slowly-dying leviathan, the Great Boulder,
and there is not much left.
Edna May Main Lode was pressed very
hard the other day to take an option over a
“promising lease” at Coolgardie, but having
heard so much about the unreliability of the
shoots on that field the Board would have
none of it. Many of the Coolgardie shoots
can be made to furnish good crushings for
a month or two, and some even for a much
longer period; but as a rule there is no per-
manency about them, and quite a number
have ruined cos. which were unfortunate
enough to give them a trial. Some, like the
Tindall’s, look tempting at first sight; but
the country rock is hard, and as the shoots
dip rapidly more and more dead work has
t:> be done at each level to reach the payable
ore. It generally takes more to get the gold
than it is worth.
Coolgardie celebrated its 2Gth birthday oh
September 7 by a roll-up of past and present
residents. Glowing references were made
by all the speakers to the men who
blazed the track; and, as usual, everyone
declared that the field had not yet seen its
best days. At present, however, it wears a
very dejected look; and to make matters
worse the hard-up Government has been rob-
bing the public buildings of their galvanised-
iron roofs. Nearly 200 tons of iron, esti-
mated to be worth up to £9O per ton, have
been removed in this way, and the excuse
given the irate residents for the unroofing
is that the Government wants the iron badly
for buildings in other places and cannot
afford to do without it.

Dorrie Doolette and others are reported
to have got hold of some lead shows at
Northampton (W.A.). There is plenty of
scope for mining enterprise backed by capi-
tal on this field ; but latterly capital has been
scared away on account of the War-time
Profits tax. Want of sufficient and efficient
labor has also greatly hampered operations.
From J. L. Strevens: “Oof Bird” (B.
26/9/’18) is under a misapprehension re-
garding this writer’s visit to Westralia on
oil matters, which was primarily to examine
and report upon a certain area of reputedly
oil-bearing country near. Wonnerup, and over
which the W.A. Oil Syndicate held options.
No effort was made to go into that State’s
oil possibilities in general, this having been
previously attempted by the State geologists,
English and others. Without wishing to
decry in any way the prospecting work of
English, an examination of such an expanse
of country included in the areas inspected by
him in six weeks, or thereabouts, amounts only
to a flying geological reconnaisance, which is
still very “cursory,” and such an examina-
tion is no justification for any expert to
“positively declare there is no oil.” Also
the W.A. Oil Syndicate and the.writer take
this opportunity of disclaiming any responsi-
bility for, or share in, the present oil pros-
pecting ventures “bobbing up everywhere in
the West,” and are directly interested in
nothing beyond the one locality previously
mentioned.
* * * *
Since the present co. took up the old Duke
Extended, Maryborough (Vie.), the claim
has eaten up £34,356 of calls, £48,700 of
gold, £l2BO of original capital and a State
loan of £2144. There has never been a sign
of a dividend, but the wages man has had
£54,000, while a further £20,000 has gone
in plant and supplies. The wonder is that
such a show has a kick left; but odd runs
of gold here and there have kept the call-
payer-loyal. Last half-year 1486 fathoms
gave 21610 z. of gold, and there is still some
pay dirt to be got out round Nos. 1, 2 and 2J
rises. Up and down the gutter the faces are
very poor. The big disappointment is the
west end, where only a few scraps of pay
dirt have been picked up in the lead. In the
hunt after something fresh bores have gone
up from a far west branch drive to. see if
the lead makes south-west. The old yarn
of prospects of gold is again being heard, but
the oof-birds are too shy nowadays.
With £2500 in the bank, Louis Hansen is
fighting his old mining crew at the Ajax
North, Daylesford (Vic.), because they
.won't work drills single-handed. Under
Arbitration Court awards Hansen has the
right to get this done. His last six
months’ work cost £0243, of which £4327
went to the worker; but all he could get
from gold was £4515. His best development
has been in a rise from No. 9 level, where
6dwt. dirt has been broken into on the new
reef. To test this run of stone a crosscut
from the long drive on the main reef at No.
S is to go out into the slate country, where
nearly all the gold of Daylesford has been
won.

Chairman Drury’s talk to the Briseis
(Tas.) shareholders about the New Reynol-
ton Colliery in South Wales was not
soothing to the big body of local share-
holders. What users there were for the
anthracite mined were either foreigners or
malsters. So when the Hun started sub-
marining the colliers, and Lloyd George cut
down malstcr work to conserve food sup-
plies, the New Raynolton got top-heavy
financially. Engineer Currie wanted to stop,
but the Board stuck on till, when the mine
flooded through a break-down of the pumps,
the Controller of Coal forbade the supply of
further plant. Altogether the London Board
put £27,000 into the pit; and now it writes
£20,000 off the investment. However,
Currie believes that when peace comes the
show can make profits. But forecasts of this
kind do not fill up holes in a cash reserve.
Further, the Wallace claims at Yackandah
(Vic.) are now admitted to be at the last-
gasp stage. If the plant there is scrapped
promptly a war-time machinery div. may be
possible, provided Lindesay Clark doesn’t
want the cash for some new area he has in
view. Chairman Drury also painted a dole-
ful picture as to Clark’s outlook at the
Briseis itself, where the Ringarooma River
ever threatens to flood him info an awkward
corner. Any pinching of the area there
would make yields look sick. Still, with
Clark on the bridge, a big fight is to be put
up to snick tin out in order to lay hands on
all the profits that are to be got with the
metal round about the £3OO mark.

During August the three smelteries in the
Cloncurry district treated 21,722 tons ore —
a record for the field. The yield is given by
the State Mines Department as 1316 tons
copper, 4490 z. gold and 14900 z. silver. The
gross value of the copper alone at £.IOS per
ton is £142,128. Hampden is the only co. on
the field reporting gold and silver values in
blister; but it is well known that Elliott
find Cuthbert produce blister containing
appreciable quantities of both metals. Cnth-
bert’s smelting of 5949 tons in 31 days was
a fine effort, and the return of 340 tons of
blister was worth £36,000, or £6 per ton
of ore. Limestone containing appreciable
quantities of copper is now counted as ore,
and some customs ore is also included, for
Cuthbert is now competing with Hampden
and other buyers for customs ore. Taking
copper at £lOB per ton (f.o.b. Sydney), and
gold at 84s. 2d. per oz., Mt. Morgan’s August
return has a gross value of £63,300 for cop-
per and £30,047 for gold, total £93,347. Of
the total ore mined in August 11,514 tons were
sent direct to the smelter and 18,768 tons to
the concentrating mill, making a total of
30,282 crudes raised during the month.
Gympie (Q.) crushed 91.011 tons during
the 12 months ended .July 31 for 36,8G00z.
of gold. The value of the total gold output
iu the_Gympie district for the year totalled
£142.557. Small but rich crushings were
raised from No. 4 North Phoenix and No. 2
North Golumiba. Deep-level mining on this
field has been disappointing; but No. 3
Columbia is now prospecting new ground.
Wonbah Molybdenite, Mt. Perry (Q.),
treated 105 tons during August, and also re-
treated 200 tons of tailings, the total yield
being 19cwt. concentrates valued at £403.
The shaft is down 86ft. below No. 1 level.
Another molybdenite show, the Mt. Bania,
has forwarded small parcels of ore to Mel-
bourne. Its shaft is down 95ft., and it is
intended to sink a further 35ft. before open-
ing out another level. In July 84 tons Mt.
Bania molybdenite ore were treated at the
M onbaji mill for concentrates worth £4OO.
A run of four weeks at Mt. Bischoff Ex-
tended (Tas.) gave 14 ton's scwt. black tin
from 1229 tons ore, and although this
grade is . highly payable with tin at
present prices the steady depletion of reseiwes
of 1 p.e. tin is likely to cause some anxiety,
unless prospects below the No. 6 level show
a decided improvement. However, the pay-
ment of a monthly sixpenny div. (£800)
should be easy while the supply of 1 p.e. ore
continues and prices are high. The third
sixpence has already been distributed. When
the plant has _ been duplicated the co. is
hopeful of making a further saving in costs.

Christie Hade, who died in Bathurst
(N.S.W.) the other day at 74, was known
anywhere in the West,
successively as butcher,
punter, barman, publican,
property-owner and auc-
tioneer. Away back he
was a noted turf figure,
and close up to the end
attended almost every
meeting in and around
Sydney. The most ro-
mantic part of his career
relates to his doings with
Ben Hall and other gen-
tlemen of the road, who
were active round Trun-
key. It was Hade who
brought Johnnie Vane
back to law and order.
The old man leaves big
slices of property in
Sydney and in several
western centres.
“The Deacon”: Dead,
in the region of the sixties
from a dread internal
trouble, the Bev. Bernon
Sheridan, one of the best-
known and picturesque
figures of the South Coast
(N.S.W.j. A competent
judge and lover of good
horseflesh, he excelled in a
field where R.C. clerics
are famed. Genial and
kindly and generous, he
differed entirely from his
brother, the Rev. “Bucky”
Sheridan, whose notorious
eccentricities culminated
in his famous attack on
the “cheek-to-cheek” danc-
ing in Lithgow a few years back. He now
lives in the old historic Presbytery at Hart-
ley (N.S.W.).
Sergeant Hugh Wagner Farmer, who
lately got the D. 5.0., left Sydney Heads
astern in 1914, fought on Gallipoii, joined
the Engineers,. and adventured on to Pales-
tine. At a point on ; the way to Jerusalem
the retreating enemy had cached in a well
150 feet deep, and had connected fuses to a
waggon-load or so of explosives in order to
welcome any unwelcome guest. Grant went
to investigate, disconnected the fuses, and
got the explosives safely to the top. Hence
the D.S.O. He comes of a fighting stock.
His grandfather, John Sanders, was Chief
Engineer on 11.M.5. Agamemnon at Sebas-
topol, in the Crimean shindy, and his great-
grandfather, Captain Francis Godench, was
on Nelson’s Victory at Trafalgar.
J. B. Reymond, an ex-M.L.A. for Forbes
(N.S.W.) died there last week. He was
introduced to an unsympathetic world 84
years ago in France, and arrived in
Victoria in 1857. The 1861 gold-rush
to Forbes swept him along, and, with
the late A. Nicholas, he started saw- and
flour-milling, and later wine-making and
farming, in the district. He grew the first
wheat thereabouts and built the town water-
supply’s weir. He was Mayor of Forbes in
1883 and 1884, but reflections need not be
cast upon his memory on that account.
When, the Imperial Camel Corps was
turned into Light Horse recently Billjim
was sorry to part with one of his most popu-
lar officers—Lieut.-Col. N. B. de Lancy
Forth, who rejoined his original unit, the
Essex Regiment. When war
broke out Forth joined an Imperial
unit,, but later on was transferred
at his own request to an Austra-
lian section of the Camel Corps.
During the. great battle at Gaza,
on April 19, 1917, when two com-
panies of the Cameliers were
almost annihilated, he displayed
reckless bravery. Despite a ter-
rific hail of machine-gun and artil-
lery fire, he calmly walked about
the field urging the boys to nush
forward. Four holes were drilled
through his helmet by bullets, and
he was severely wounded in the
shoulder, but refused to quit.
Later in the evening, when the
Camel Corps was withdrawn from
the firing-line the Colonel got to a
clearing-station, where his wound
was attended to. Three days
later he was back on the job again.
For his share in the battle he got
the D.S.O. and another decoration
to a M.C. bar. He is an old Geelong Gram-
mar boy. and was at one time pearling at
Broome (W.A.J.
Henry Stevens, of Ivapunda (S. Aus.),
claims to be 100 not out this week, and it is
likely that he is in the vicinity of the cen-
tury. At any rate, he was grown up when he
came to Australia 77 years ago. In his best
days, before the railways went far north of
Adelaide, he earned a crust carting copper
ore to the sea from the Burra mine, and,
later, from the Wallaroo, and loading coal
back.
Archbishop Redwood, who was consecrated
Bishop of Wellington (M.L.) in 1874, is on
“JUST BEFORE THE BATTLE,
MOTHER."
a trip to Sydney. He preached the dedica-
tion service at St. Mary’s on the opening of
the Cathedral by Archbishop Vaughan in
1882. All the other mitre wearers who
attended that ceremony are dead. The ser-
mon created a sensation. Redwood had the
MS. in front of him, but as Frederick Darley
and other high dignitaries who were not
R.C.’s were present, the preacher omitted
certain allusions to other denominations.
Unfortunately he did not score them out in
the MS. before it was handed to the news-
paper-men, and a most unholy row ensued.
Darley and others were charged with having
listened unmoved' to Redwood’s attacks, and
the charge got a good racing start before his
Honor could dash into print with the
explanation.
“T. 0.1.”: Apropos Bishop Broughton (B.
26/9/T8). It is not very widely known that
he had a club foot. On an occasion of a visit
by him to an up-country church the local
clergyman made great preparations for the
bishop’s reception. A special choir was got
together, and as Broughton limped up the
aisle in procession the choristers burst into
song, “How beautiful upon the mountains
are the feet of him that bringeth glad tid-
ings.” When they saw the bishop’s imperfec-
tion they wished that their parents had never
been born.
The Finn sheep property at Port Fairy
(Vic.), which has been held by one member
of the family or another since the sixties
of last century, has just gone on the market
through the death in action of Lawrence
Finn, a trooper with the A.I.F. The Vic.
Western District has a long tally of similar
war-sales, and another too-long list of war-
widows who now keep the fences in repair
and watch the sales at Newmarket on behalf
of their orphan families.
The Tories of St. George’s, Hanover
Square,, have adopted as their candidate for
George Reid’s seat in the House of Com-
mons, Newton Moore, formerly Agent-General
for Westralia. He is a native of Bun-
bury (W.A.), was born in 1870 and served
surveyor’s articles to John Forrest’s brother
Alec. He was Mayor of Bunbury and
M.L.A. for the town in 1904. In the year
following he joined the Rason Ministry as
Minister for Lands, and when Rason went
to London as Agent-General Moore became
Premier at the age of 35, and with not two
years’ experience in politics. Years ago he
was associated with the flotation of tin
largest jarrah companies on the London mar-
kets. For long he was a Government con-
tract surveyor. He started the first
Mounted Infantry Corps in W.A.. and was
for some time in command of the 18th night
Horse.
Pneumonia, following swiftly on influenza,
last week killed B. T. McKay, manager of
the Commonwealth Small Arms Factory, at
Litbgow (N.S.W.), and deprived Australia
ot a specially valuable citizen. Defence Min-
ister Pearce publicly acknowledged the
patriotism and valuable service of this
Scotch engineer, who died at 69. For
30 years works manager of Walkers,
Ltd., Maryborough (Q.), he had just taken
charge at Lithgow to devote his whole time
to the war-work he loved best.
_ The much-contested will of the late Nor-
dica has been settled at last, in favor of her
three sisters, to whom the estate, valued at
400,000 dollars was bequeathed. In Decem-
ber, 1913, Nordica sailed from Sydney for
the East, was wrecked in Torres Strait, fell
ill at Thursday Island, and died at Batavia.
She married four times and so escaped dying
an old maid.
“Mustard Gold”: Since Captain Fred
Hare retired from the Coinmissionership
there is hardly a personality among the
Westralian police worth metre than passing
mention. Hare had administrative ability
and showed it effectively. ConUel, his suc-
cessor, is a plain man. The C.I.D. branch
lias produced a few smart men, notably the
late Kavanagh, who conducted the investi-
gations brought about by the Gold Stealing
Commission some years ago, and who failed
to substantiate many allegations, giving as
his reason that he was not able to overhaul
several socially well-placed persons believed
to be large participators in the illicit indus-
try. Among present-day sleuths Inspector
Walsh stands out: as a kindly and competent
chaser of the fugitive from justice.
Billy Brain was born in the Speck, and is
the son of Hobart’s oldest living native. A sur-
veyor and civil engineer until the ’eighties, he
had to convert him-
self into a general
handy man owing to
the slump caused by
the closing down of
the V.D.L. Bank.
Hobart at that time
was one of the most
untidy towns that
Nature ever mourned
over. It was in-
habited by about
30,000 cordial and
dilatory souls. Billy
began pegging away
at improvements, one
of which was the
underground drain-
age system. He be-
came Hobart’s Town
Clerk in 1905, and
has improved things
considerably since.
Golf enables him to
get rid of his surplus
energy, and he puts
in a lot of overtime
organising patriotic
functions. His son is
at the commotion in
France.

Alexander Y. Affleck, overseer of Morden
station, West Darling (N.S.W.), who died

the largest runs in Australia. Later he
managed Weinteriga, in the West Darling

THE OLD FRONT LINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
We’re back again in the summer splendid
Of baking noons and of cloudless shine;
The southern thrust of the foe is ended,
We’re back again in the old front line.
Where No Man’s Land is a field of clover,
And grass is high on the duck-board’s track.
The green is waving our dead men over,
(I wonder now do they know we’re back?)
For kings may bicker and courts may wrangle
And nations lock in the grip of death,
But summer sends us the wild-rose tangle,
And honeysuckle is sweet of breath.
The empty village where dogs are straying,
A gaping roof and a swinging d00r....
I think at times of the children playing
In glad to-morrows that know not war.
These ways shall ring with their laughing chorus,
Their path trod smoother by feet like mine....
A warm wind whispers that God is for us—
We’re back again in the old front line.

SOCIETY
JUST THE PLACE!
THE ARTIST: “I'm going to do my bit by
presenting some of my work to one of
the soldiers' hospitals.”
THE PHILISTINE: “Good idea. Send them
to where the blinded heroes are?”
The Bulletin has been advised about the
incident in various ways from Billjims on
the Western Front, but not in such a con-
densed form as this: 9 a.m., Billy Hughes is
expected any minute. 12.10 p.m., Billy
Hughes is coming. 12.11 p.m., Billy Hughes
is here. 12. p.m., Billy Hughes has gone.
The “Rocks” resumed area—that high-up
bit of old Sydney which overhangs the sun-
set on the west and The Bulletin on the
south-east —continues to be a Permanent
Work. There are doubts, however, about
the reproductiveness. Aforetime the area
was a region of steep places, hovels, goats
and “pushes.” Then arrived a more or less
progressive Government that bought out the
private slum-owner, replaced the hovels, etc.,
with new buildings, chiefly dwelling-houses
intended for the workers of the adjacent
waterside, and appointed a Department to
go ahead and make the Socialistic enterprise
a monumental success. Lately a return
showed a loss in revenue of £270 for 1915-16.
£6067 for 1916-17, and £7819 for 1917-18 ; but
the Auditor-General, in his annual report,
reckons things are much worse than these
figures indicate, because had the business
been run on a strict commercial basis, the
loss would have been £2735 for 1915-16,
£8738 for 1916-17, and £10,542 for 1917-18,
compared with a profit of £1422 for 1914-15.
The A.-G. thinks that unless a revision of
rentals happens the Consolidated Revenue
will have to carry a constantly-increasing
annual deficit, and recommends throwing
overboard the present departmental control
and running the show on commercial lines
under the Industrial Undertakings Act. Of
course, the tenants will make an unholy row
if their rents are pushed up during these
times of dwindling shipping and consequent
slackness of jobs alongshore. Still some-
thing will have to be done.
“Hamer” : When Fritz felt good and fresh
and was pushing our lines back, the Chinese-
labor battalions became panicky, and on at
least one occasion a crowd got out of con-
trol and broke. I was in a little village
where three strays from one of the camps
arrived —tall, big fellows, looking as scared
as rabbits, as though expecting the streets
to blow up before them. An empty barrel
stood in the track before an estaminet; and
they had just reached it when a rattle of
sharp sound broke the quietness of the day.
It was only our Archies strafing a roaming
Fritz ’plane; but it was enough. The way
those three big Chinamen squealed and
struggled and fought to get shelter behind
that empty cask would have made a greal
comedy film.

John Lewis has been pressing seriously in
S. Aus. Leg. Council that cremation should
be made compulsory. The opportunity to be
turned into ashes has been given in Adelaide
since 1891; but an official report shows that
of 2500 burials in S.A. every year 1000 go to
West Terrace Cemetery, Adelaide, and only
about 3 per cent, of the accumulated corpses
are cremated. The cost has come down from
£4O to £5, but is still much dearer than
burial. The general feeling in the Council
was that Lewis is in advance of his time
(any person with a sensible reform idea is
generally in advance of the times when he in-
troduces it to a Leg. Council), and he with-
drew his proposal. The occasion was bright-
ened by a letter to the newspapers from an
Anglican canon, who described cremation as
“essentially pagan,” and dragged in a sug-
gestion that it could be made “a source of
profit, after the style of the German corpse-
factories.” Who said that the Church of
England parson is a dull person ?
Acting Prime Minister Watt announces
that some of the blatant extravagance will
have to be cut off the Baby Bonus. First
it was proposed that the child
of poor parents should have a
little better start on his or
her career as a valuable mem-
ber of the community. Then
the scheme was extended to
all children lest the poor
mother should feel the stigma
of poverty, it being still the
idea that poverty is a dis-
grace. But the bill last year
was £624,000, equal to 124,000
babies, and the recorded
births for 1917 were
129,965; but perhaps
something went in ex-
penses. This wasn’t the
worst case. In 1915,
138,855 births were actu-
ally paid for, and if
Knibbs is correct, only
134,87.1 children were
born. Watt says that
where the parents have
more than £250 a year income, if the baby
has such high ideas that he has to be bribed
to be born, he can just stay away.

“R.A.M.”: The Bulletin yarn of the
old-time Queensland judge who was run
over by an alligator at Cairns esplanade
reminds me of an experience that I had in
the vicinity. One night I stayed at an oblig-
ing squatter’s homestead while I w r as on a
journey. After a good dinner and a game
of poker the boss took me out to get a
breath of cool air. Walking down the main
path in the dark I fell over what I took to
be a tree-trunk until it moved from under
me. I naturally got a scare and let out a yell.
The host said: “It’s all right, it’s all right;
it’s only Tom, our pet alligator.” Next
morning I went to investigate the pet and
found him thinking out a problem. He
had climbed over 6ft. of netting and swal-
lowed the homestead’s best collie and was
moored by the chain !
THE WRONG SORT.
THE KID ( continuing the story): “ ‘So the Fairy Prince and Blue Eyes were married
and lived happily ever after ! Mother, arc you living happily ever after?"
MOTHER: “Well, dear, I married a Merchant Prince.” (Hurriedly): “Now read me the
newt story.”
“Ziff” : This is how they encourage enlist-
ment in P.M.G. Webster's Department.
Went in to get the necessary permission to
join up the other day, and was politely in-
formed that the Department looked to us to
“stand by them,” on account of the shortage
of men. Was then shown a list of
about 15 names—all recruits in waiting.
Some had been waiting for 18 months, and
still no prospect of going. I humbly sug-
gested that, if we were necessary for the
running of the service, was there such
a thing as an exemption badge, and was told
that such a course was suggested to the
Defence Department, which would not enter-
tain it, although exemption badges are worn
. by employees of a private cable service, from
the messenger up.

The need for a. fourth Judge, felt in S.
Aus. Supreme Court for years past, is more
acute than ever. It has become necessary,
for the time being, to let one Judge, take a
court while the other two sit as the Full
Court, in spite of the obvious disadvantage
that if the two ’Onahs sitting happen to differ
in opinion no result can be reached, unless
they toss for it or allow the litigants to
draw lots.
“Tarago” : The nearest thing I ever saw
to a strike in our battalion was during the
first big push on the Somme. We were
afflicted with a brasshat who required
our officers to write reports of incidents
occurring in the line and to hand them in to
him when we came out. This meant lining
up the whole weary battalion to hear his
criticism —mostly adverse. At that time it
was our policy to raid Fritz every night and
keep him on the jump. Nine times, out of
10 we were successful; but one night lie
laid for us, and surprised an officer with
seven men. The odds were at least three to
one, so the Aussie officer gave one order.
“Shell-holes, boys!” and they lay there keep-
ing Fritz off with their Mills's and a stray
revolver shot or two until he had exhausted
his supply of bombs. He then withdrew
and turned on a couple of machine-guns
and a battery of whiz-bajjgs. The officer
passed the word that it was no use going
on. that they would have to retire. Every
man got back to one of our machine-gun
posts, where the leader sat down and casu-
ally asked : “Has any one got a shell-dress-
ing?” His left arm was almost severed at
the elbow, and he had a hole through the
shoulder that you could put two fingers in.
The report of this “incident” read: “On
Monday night Mr, took a party of
men out against the chalk-pit strong-post
Met with strong opposition—bombing and
machine-gun fire. Retired. One casualty.”
“Just fancy!” roared the fatuous brasshat
after reading this to the battalion. “Fancy
HER NARROW VIEW.
“What did she leave her has hand for?”
“He was 100 broad-minded.”
“Too broad-minded?”
“Yes—about other men's wires.”
telling me they met with strong opposition
and only one casualty ! It was their duty
to go on. I don’t know what the battalion
is coming to,” etc. The ass was removed
shortly after; but not in the way that we
were praying for.

SPRING IN THE ’LOO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Down Forbes-street there are cypress-trees whose
thoughts are deep
Of morning mists and Spring-time breath of God ;
Slack Bourke-street’s broken gardens turn in troubled
sleep
And little wide-eyed peach-stars smile and nod.
Green veils of pepper-trees in Palmer-street droop
down ;
And shy wistaria drapes the shabby wall;
And tall ships keep their tryst with morn-kist Sydney
town
Where Spring has come at last —all child and
sparrow call.
The back yards’ tumbling fences overflow in pink.
And yellow lamps of jasmine light the lane:
The thirsty ghosts creep out to watch the ships,
Blinking where new green carpets the Domain.
Tall ships through many waters bring their war-
worn freight
Of friends of Death and Honor from afar,
Come home to keep their word with Spring. . . .The
’Loo wakes late
And slouches towards the wharfside—and the bar.
Two straining ships deep-freighted down with youth,
And flagged in ensign of a job well done—
Some have come back, and some are left for Honor’s
truth ;
And each is writ as Sydney’s worthy son,
Back here or there—in Sydney or in France deep
down —
The ’l,oo knows that; and strolls down past the
lane
To see the boys and feel the Spring in Sydney town —
And welcome Sydney’s soul come home again.

Bird's-eye view of Works, on twelve acres of land, with a frontage to Victoria Street, Richmond, and a water-frontage to the
Yarra, three miles from the heart of the City of MeVbourne.
think of the future of iron and steel
manufacture in this country (where it
1 was so sorely discouraged rn the past)
is to think of the enterprising Charles Ruwolt
I’ty., whose principal works, established only
a few years ago on 12 acres of land at
Richmond, on the banks of the Yarra, are
situated within three miles' tram-ride of
Melbourne Town Hall.
Also, the thought of what the Tariff is
going to do for the protection of this im-
portant industry when the war is over must
occur naturally to every good Australian
who has the development of local industry
at heart. But that is another story.
Charles Ruwolt's business got its first
impetus at Wangaratta from an order for
Bucket Dredging Machinery. The then
struggling manufacturer decided to specialise
in the production of what he cheerfully
alludes to as the Devastating Dredge. There
was a demand for the D.D., and Ruwolt
studied the question of how to supply the
best possible bucket dredges and the machi-
nery appertaining to their devastations. His
determination to do the thing properly, get-
ting always nearer to perfection in detail as
he went along, has achieved a fine record for
the Ruwolt' Works ; for of late years it has
been the birthplace of every bucket dredge
(for gold or tin recovery) ordered in Aus-
tralia.
The first Tin Dredge built at Ruwolt's
went into action just seven years ago. Light
in construction compared with the later type,
it has nevertheless proved a great worker, for
in six years it treated 31 million cubic yards
of ground, wherefrom was captured tin to
the tune of nearly £300,000. The light, plant
which accounted for 2694 tons of tin up
to September, 1917, was the Tongkah Com-
pound Dredge, and an admirable photo of it
appears in the catalogue.
The firm’s illustrated catalogue of Bucket
Dredges is a fund of information and advice
to those about to devastate. It talks
learnedly on the vexed question of Wood v.
Steel pontoons, stating that, whereas the
Firm has built many dredges with either sort
of pontoon, experience has convinced it that
steel comes cheapest in the end. What
Charles Ruwolt does not know about Top
and Bottom Tumblers. Boilers, Ladder
Hoists, Revolving and Shaking Screens, etc.,
is not worth knowing. Dredging machinery
has been with him in his dreams ever since
he saw the beginnings of his fortune in it.
The Firm has watched its dredges at work
—as many as 50 of them at one time—and
has executed the necessary incidental re-
pairs whilst they were working. The out-
come of this watchfulness was a continual
improvement in the design and construction
of the goods. Where the gold or tin exists in
payable quantity the Ituwolt Dredge can be
trusted to waste no money in the recovery of
it. As to whether the face of the country
suffers from the recovery process—well,
Ruwolt doesn’t form the companies that do
C-W'
Assam Kumba.nfi Bucket j redye, just completed
States .
and shipped
to Federated Malay
the damage. He only supplies them with
their implements of dividends, and derives a
fine advertisement from the orders. Four
dredges in course of construction at the same
time are an impressive sight. Richmond
notes the vast ship-like structures in the
erection-yard, and reckons there is something
doing.
» * * *
But it is hard for an Australian manu-
facturer to become a prophet in his own
country. Recently Mr. Ruwolt received a
letter from a municipal officer in another
State, who had seemingly learned of him by
accident, and was anxious to knew whether
he could possibly turn out the very kind of
Dredge in which lie has been specialising for
the past sixteen years.
* * * *
An inevitable result of the demand for the
ituwolt Bucket Dredging outfit was the in-
stallation of a Steel Foundry on the 12-acre
property. Cast-iron is not used to any great
extent in the machinery, therefore many
hands are kept busy on the production of
Steel Castings, guaranteed to jneet any
standard test. There are various ways of
creating steel, but before installing his new
plant Ruwolt chose the process known as
the “Side-blown Converter,” as being the
most suitable for the making of Steel that
will be cast in items weighing only a few
pounds in some cases and several tons in
others. By the Converter process—the per-
formance of the Converter process is a great
sisdit truly ! —Ruwolt makes four main classes
of steel, viz., Extra Ductile. Ordinary Duc-
tile, Medium Hard and Extra Hard, the
Steel Moulder who has direct control of the
Foundry being as clever nn expert in his
way ns the Metallurgist who rules the
Laboratory and Testing Department.
The quality of the steel is attested by the
fact that the Foundry turned out a number
of locomotive-driving wheel centres for the
Victorian Railways some time ago, and has
lately completed an order for the wheels of
the large Consolidation type of Locomotive.
For these a tensile strength of from 2f> to
30 tons per square inch is required. The
test at the Foundry gave them a strength of
29.40 per square inch, and an elongation far
in advance of the specification. Uuwolt’s,'by
the way, were the first steel-makers in the
Commonwealth to successfully manufacture
cast-steel centres for locomotive and carriage
wheels.
* -x- *
One of the Foundry’s specialties is the
Roll Shell made for mining companies, the
steel being of a particular alloy developed at
the Foundry, and the Shells specially beat-
treated and toughened.
When it is mentioned that Ruwolt's have
made cast-steel Gear Wheels up to 0 tons
weight, and that Gears at a Commonwealth
Naval Base carry the firm's name, no fur-
ther assurance is needed of excellence in the
goods. Castings made for the Naval Depart-
ment bad to be the last word in accuracy.
Attention to detail is the soul of success.
• In the production of Manganese Steel
Castings (which are among the newest
achievements of the Foundry, and for which
the demand is in excess of the supply), as
in all his other undertakings since he started
heroic hardware manufacture, Charles
Ruwolt has aimed at accuracy and hit the
mark. He is the self-made man who took
time over the job, untroubled by the itching-
desire to get-rich-quick which prevents many
another manufacturer from arriving at the
very best results. The works at Richmond
are something for the founder to be proud
of, but one hopes the time is not far distant
when 12 acres will be too small a field for
the local pioneer in Manganese Steel-making.
It remains for the Federal Government to
safeguard Ruwolt’s enterprise and give it the
encouragement he has deserved. At present
he employs 300 hands, but even under the
limited Richmond conditions there is room
for great expansion.
Meanwhile the C. R. Pty. is always widen-
ing its range of products, and seeking to
create new demands for the special metal
castings it can supply to order.

A bottle of your Temedy, however, was placed in my hands, and out of courtesy to my friend, who had an interest in

“R.E.P.”: Here in the forward area I
just had a visit from our pay-sergeant. He
asked me for my pay-book and said : “I have
a debit to enter up, also a credit or two.”
“What is the debit?” I asked, and he shell-
shocked me by replying: “Cab fare one
shilling, October, 1915.” I was on Gal-
lipoli from September 4 until the last day
of evacuating, and I can bring witnesses to
prove that all the time I was there I did not
go for one joy-ride in a cab or even see a bar-
maid. My conscience is quite clear on these
points.

A feeling surely prevails that the returned
soldier is a pot-plant. The repatriation offi-
cials in Victoria report that in a little over
two months they arranged to deposit 101 of
the species on 9403 acres —an average of
93 acres each. The land was bought at an
average price of £l6 16s. per acre. So
apparently each soldier will start owing
£1579, and, in addition, when a 2000-acre
property is cut into 20 farms, there are at
least 19 new houses to build ; also fencing,
tools and a little stock have to be paid for.
Of course the terms will be easy, but it takes
a lot of special knowledge to make a living
on 93 acres, with perhaps £2OOO of debt
(interest at even 4 per cent, is £BO per
annum.) It certainly can’t be done out of
wheat. Assuming a liberal 13 bushels to
the acre, there would be about 1200 bushels,
and at 4s. 6d. that would be £270, if it
could all be realised. But horsefeed and seed,
and the eternal cankerworm of repairs and
depreciation, also cartage and occasional
demands for fertiliser and losses of stock
and sundries, eat away a mighty lot. And
the kitchen-gardening kind of industry is an
expert business that even few good‘wheat-
farmers are equal to. Anyhow the rich
kitchen-gardener is hard to find. The Re-
patriation people got rid of 27 people who
were previously on the land, so they weren’t
big monopolists who were bought out. In
fact, in some places the Vic. Repatriation
crowd have been buying out holders of 50 or
100 acres to make room for soldiers, which
is bribing closely-settled men of experience
to make room for, in many cases, amateurs,
and deeply-indebted ones at that. But there
aren’t many really big and really fertile
estates to be broken up without going out
WAR-TIME ARITHMETIC.
PUZZLED SCHOOLBOY: “Dad, if I buy 100

into the West, and that would rouse an
agitation for the development of another
port to rival Melbourne. So the old shovel-
ful of land is passed from one man to
another in the name of repatriation.
“Centurion” : The sword, thought to have
gone to the scrapheap, seems to be coming-
back to its own. In the recent big victory
in Palestine, Indian and British cavalry had
a chance to use it and the lance. Indeed,
Allenby had so foreseen the need for the steel
that he had armed the Australasian mounted
troops with the cavalryman’s weapon, in addi-
tion to rifle and
bayonet, and with
gratifying results to
everybody but Jacko.
The cables speak of
our mounted men
“sabreing” the Turks.
The modern cavalry
sword is not the sabre
with its heavy back
and curved cutting
edge, but the needle-
pointed “epbe,” for
thrusting only. The
use of the new arm
would come the more
easily to our men,
since sword-drill to-
day comprises one
thrust and one parry
only. All the old
complicated cuts and
parries have been put
aside. The cavalry
sword now is a good
deal longer than that
• usually seen in Aus-
tralia, and narrower
in the blade, with a.
deep shell hilt and no
cutting edge. The grip
is set at an angle of
about 15deg., with' the
blade as an aid to the
thrust above men-
tioned. The Light
Horseman is now
armed like his military
forebears of Marl-
borough’s day, the
Dragoons, who did
much fighting on foot with musket and
bayonet, and carried the sword, in addition,
for mounted charges.

“Fax”: The male sex, apparently, is be-
ginning to avenge itself for the centuries of
alleged indignity and oppression it has suf-
fered from mother-in-law. The stage mother-
in-law has ever been one of the ills that man
is heir to —mostly at 6s. a time, plus war-
tax at the box-office. She has always been
the wife’s mother. The conventional inflic-
tion was beautifully expressed in a farcical
comedy recently, where the wife wept bit-
terly over husband’s antipathy to her mother.
“When we got married you said I was to
be your little queen,” she whimpered. To
which the brute replied : “Quite so, my dear,
you were to be the queen, and I was to be the
king. But we never agreed that your mother
was to come along and be the ace.” A
wife’s petition for divorce, heard in Mel-
bourne Practice Court last
week, was based on the fact that
her husband’s mother had come
along and been the ace. Domes-
tic happiness was made impos-
sible for her by the old hard-
shelled lady’s everlasting pre-
sence in her home. Mother-in-
law frowned upon the baby and
objected to a perambulator—
said it was a nuisance in these
days of war and three changes
a week at the should-she-permit-
him pictures. Eventually the
young wife’s own people took
her away from mother-in-law,
and then she complained that
she was practically driven from
home and was entitled to a
divorce on the plea of “con-
structive desertion.” Justice
Hood, however, blighted peti-
tioner’s hopes by explaining
that a husband is within his
legal rights in allowing his
mother to make trouble for his
bride. He can turn her mother
out of his villa residence, but
the wife can’t turn his mother
off the premises, nor run away
and sob that she’s deserted.
The ghosts of many husbands
must have chuckled over this decision.
The long lane of masculine despair
has had a turning. But in the novel
test case decided by Judge Hood the
lady victim has no redress. She remains a
sad example of the inequality of the sexes.
Whereas Man’s mother-in-law is only a con-
ventional joke, Woman’s mother-in-law is
no joke at all. She’s a solemn fact.
The artificial limb-factory, which was
opened at Keswick (S.A.) in the beginning
of September, is going well and is turning
out the latest scientific appliances for assist-
ing soldiers who have returned from the
Front handicapped by the loss of a limb.
Captain “Nat” Campbell is manager of the
factory, and the present staff is 12 —all men
who have done more than a bit at the Front,
and, with two exceptions, all have lost a
leg. The wood used for making the artificial
limbs is basket-willow from America —it
would be marvellous if something wasn’t im-
ported to make the job complete—and a
similar material secured from Lobethal (S.
Aus.).
THE CHEEK OF MAI
“Mother says if you don't marry me before
you sail she'll have a word with you."
“She's the limit."
“ Isn't she? I told her to mind her own busi-
ness. I said to her that if you didn't
toe the mark I’d have a word with you
myself.”
“Straight Wire”: During the Huns’ big
push last March H.Q. issued orders that no
livestock of any description were to be killed
by troops, but was as far as possible to be
driven to the rear.
Nugget, Snow and I,
stretcher-bearers, were
coming out of the line
when Nugget bayon-
eted a prime porker.
We dragged the de-
ceased through a gap
in the hedge, and were
holding council over
its disposal when some
staff-officers came clat-
tering along the road.
Hastily we dumped
the dead pig on the
stretcher, covered the
carcase with a great
coat and oil sheet, then
put a tin lid over the
porker’s clock and a
gas-mask handy there-
. to. Proceeding down
the road w T e passed the
Red Tabs, who duti-
fully saluted the dead.
There were pork chops
later.
“S.M.” reviews the' nursery :
It seems to me that either the figures are wrong
or the baby is leading a double life. Going by
the tables in Ivnibbs’s Quarterly Summary: in 1913
Victoria had 35,970 babies and collected the £5
bonus on 36,636; while Westralia had' 9218 babies
and collected on 9305, and Tasmania had . 5886
babies and took the money for 5969. In 1911 all
the States were on the same game. N. S. Wales
was paid for 49 more babies than the registration
showed, Victoria for 349 more, Queensland for 416
more, S.A. for 203 more, Westralia for 200
more, Tasmania for 72 more. In 1915 things were
pretty calm, but in 1916 Victoria was paid for 343
excess babies, Queensland for 19, S.A. for 55,
Westralia for 12, and Tasmania for 27. After that
there are only six months’ figures at my disposal; but
between January and June, 1917, Victoria seems to
have been paid for 144 too much baby, S.A. for
145 excess baby, and Tasmania for 33. The Northern
Territory and the Federal Territory are not men-
tioned separately among the bonuses, though they are
among the births. Possibly for bonus purposes one
is lumped in with S.A. and the other with N. S.
Wales. But that doesn’t account for the other
four States being paid the £5 gratuity on more
infants than the birth-register shows—especially for
1 ictoria being the biggest discrepancy and appear-
ing on the list four times out of five events. Also
the 5S births in the N.T. in 1914 don’t account
for S.A.’s 203 excess. It occurs to me that the bonus
is collected on every real infant, rich or poor, and
on a lot of other offspring as well.
The “one big union” idea is catching on.
At Wangaratta (Vic.) recently a wedding
was celebrated at which the bridegroom
turned the scale at 20st. and the bride at
TBst.

catch a 14-year-old boy doing this “King’s”

generally selected. The lad was quite willing

BEAUTY AND THE FEAST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There is no finer thing for the complexion than
rosy-cheeked apples taken internally.
When Adam delved, and fair Even span,
The apple’s rich complexion mocked her.
She longed for cheeks as rich in hue ;
To Eden came the Serpent, who
Announced he was a beauty doctor.
And in this way was brought about
The lady’s much-discussed deflection.
Her meitl made all creation ill.
Man took to work (and stays there still)
That she might have a good complexion!

ACROSS THE WAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
They’re dancing in the house across the way.
Between the trees, two windows filled with light
Are open to the garden and the night,
And to and fro the dancers step and sway,
Twin figures; pretty girls all gleam and glow
From cheek and shoulder ’gainst a man’s dark
arm....
Somehow I think the tunes now lack the charm '
Of dancing music of four years ago.
’Tis late for writing. There was / much to do,
And I was spinning all the live-long day.
Now I am tired and only want to lay
My work aside and send my thoughts to you.
Your old frayed envelope, cross-marked with green,
Lies on the table by me as I write
For company ; I feel so lost to-night
With all the leagues of lonely dark between.
I want to tread those shell-ploughed roads with you,
And those dark caves beneath the chalk So deep—-
The Seven Sleepers there, their rest might keep,
And—if death knocks I want to answer too.
How great a thing to be a man and give
One’s body at a gift; we women —we —
Grown poor in sorrow’s daily usury,
Drink death by driblets every day—and live!
How poor a thing a woman is to-day,
When God wants men ; how mean a lot to fret
And strain the fetters of our sex —and yet....
They’re dancing in the house across the way.

POLITICAL
POINTS
There was a time—before Australia had a
£5OOO-per-annum Federal a pent in a
£1,000,000-palace in London —when the going
of an Australian Premier to the big city was
an event. Graham Berry went once, but that
was to explain to the British authorities that
they had supplied Victoria with a Tory and
utterly unworkable and immovable Upper
House, and that the deadlock was hopeless,
and to ask for a change. Dibbs went once
on the cheap (£1000), and his political
friends supplied the money. There was no
Federal Prime Minister to go then, so Dibbs
went. Bigjohn Forrest dropped in on his
Sovereign once or twice —at his own expense.
The State Premiers who carried the Federal
Constitution Bill to London went by the
request of the British Government on im-
portant business. They got £lOOO each, and
one of them (Alfred Deakin) handed back a
considerable balance. Nowadays it would
almost be cheaper in some States for the Pre-
miers to live in London, and as for their
bills—well, Holman, of N. S. Wales, and his
“staff” (Dibbs didn’t take a staff) cost the
State £2259 so far for one visit, and appar-
ently the invoices are still dropping in.
There is one plain, cheap potentate who
never goes to London —the President of the
United States. The Constitution forbids him
leaving the country. And he rules 115,000,000
people with more authority than King George
possesses for only three times the salary of
Australia’s chief peacock in London, quite
apart from the six smaller State peacocks.
Also, his palace isn’t a patch on Australia
House.
While Watt, Acting-Prime Minister, is
talking about rationing the users of imported
petrol, someone should remind him of the
paralysed Australian oil-getting industry in
the Wolgan Valley (Newnes, N.S.W.). The
unlucky English co. spent nearly £2,000,000
on the plant that is lying idle there, and if
the Commonwealth Government really takes
its coat off it should be able to start the
wheels again and make Australia independent
of the foreign oil.
From Sussex-street: —
Some time ago the N. S. Wales Government tried
to make itself good with the cockies by announcing
that it had decided to give an advance of Is. per
bushel on the new season’s wheat over and above
the 3s. promised by the Federal Government. The
latter has kicked, and insinuated that if such action
is taken regardless of what is being done in other
States, it will not pay its whack. Nevertheless
Premier Holman declares that the N. S. Wales cocky
is to get an advance of 4s. against his wheat per
bushel, Federal Government or no Federal Govern-
ment. Now it turns out that the wheatgrowers
in the Ma State down near the Victorian border,
who have tor years delivered their wheat to Mel-
bourne (their natural port), are not to stand on
the same footing as other growers whose natural port
is Sydney. The advance is offered against wheat
delivered at country railway-stations, and it has
been decided that this will be, strictly interpreted,
and the cocky who takes his wheat into Victoria
will not be recognised, but must take the advance
made by the Victorian Government —it may be
3s. 6d., or less. If he chooses to haul his
wheat uphill to Sydney and pay the extra freight, of
course he will be recognised as a good Sydney man
and get his 4s. This differentiation between the
citizens of the one State is an abject example of
State Frights. There is no announcement that the
Government of N. S. Wales will not collect income,
land, probate taxes and so on, from these cookies
who live on the border, and don’t therefore patronise
out railways; nor, when the same Government grabbed
the wheat in 1914 at ss. a bushel when it was
worth Bs. on the other side of the border, was
there any distinction made between the border cockies
and any others. The Victorian sympathiser gets it
both ways and, each way, where it hurts.
The charges levelled against the N. S.
Wales State trawlers, which spend £1 Bs. sd.
on an average for every £1 worth of fish,
was the usual story of too-many heaven-born
ON A BAD WICKET.
THE HOPE OF HIS SIDE: “Ach, two wickets down, und now I suppose he vill send me
out to make up the hat trick.”
loan geniuses. An angry member in the
Assembly last week gnashed his teeth about
an expensive depot built and abandoned;
about costly machinery bought and never
used; about immense quantities of fresh
water being bought to wash fish that previ-
ously used to wash themselves with salt
water; about good fish being condemned by
experts who could afford to be off-hand in
their methods, because it wasn’t their fish ;
and about repairing material for trawlers
being brought from Newcastle to Sydney,
because all repairs must necessarily be done
at Sydney. Public enterprise .is a great
thing when it isn’t run by men who have
been trained all their lives in the faith that
losses don’t really matter while the loan
money holds out, but unless the country gets
a new kind of politician it may have to de-
cide to let Private Enterprise do the work
under careful supervision, and pay its own
losses.
During the couple of weeks in which the
N S. Wales Assembly was hustling the esti-
mates through, many hours were saved
by the Chairman of Committees “leaving the
chair” and resumipg later without the use-
less preliminary of formal business with
which each sitting day opens. At the week-
end the same thing was about to be done
when somebody remembered the intervening
Sunday, also that the Votes and Proceedings
do not record the goings of the chairman.
The sleepy Speaker was dragged from his
retreat, and, after mounting into his chair, he
“left it” for a later hour in the day, which
was the following Monday. So everything
was in order according to May or Bernard
Shaw or somebody, and no apparent prece-
dent was established for a Sunday sitting.
The surprisingly extravagant land-
purchases of the late Vaughan Government
in S. Aus. have left a legacy of troubles be-
hind them. Magistrate Noel Webb, sitting
as a Royal Commission, threw a heavy
blame on Styles, Minister for Lands, Pethick
the Surveyor-General, and Britten Jones,
Government valuator. The results to the
three men have been varied. Styles, who
was by the time Webb’s report came out a
member of the new Peake Ministry, resigned
as a point of honor, confidently expecting
(he says) a further and proper inquiry. He
has got no further hearing at all, and, having
been dropped out of Parliament at a recent
election, he seems to have no way of getting
one. Pethick obtained a formal and indepen-
dent inquiry, which practically exonerated
him. Britten Jones got leave to bring fresh
evidence and be represented by counsel be-
fore Noel Webb, who has now made a fur-
ther report on Jones, which has led him to
retire from the Government service. He
claims that he has not had a fair deal. His
lawyers protested in the Adelaide dailies
(20/9/’18) :
The Government, at starting, had assured the inter-
ested men that “no accusations have been made,”
yet the Commission “found against them on charges
which were never brought against them, and against
which they had no opportunity of defending them-
selves .... Mr. Jones was sent back to the Commis-
sion which had condemned him.... How can it be
seriously argued that Mr. Jones has had a trial?. .. .
The same measure of justice should be meted out to
him as yas granted to Mr. Pethick.... Let the Gov-
ernment' now formulate charges, and give him full
opportunity to make his defence to those charges,
and justice will be done.
The Government, so far, doesn’t seem to
have had a rush of enthusiasm to the head.
While the sectionally-selected executive
of the N. S. Wales Labor Party is striving
hard to work up public protest against what
it terms the “unprecedented tyranny of Hol-
man” in introducing the Sedition Bill,
which provides for the disfranchisement of
a person found guilty of sedition for any
term up to seven years, the time seems ripe
to whisper into the P.L.L.’s lily-white ear
its own rule 40, which says:—
Any member or ex-member of a league or affiliated
union opposing a selected Labor candidate at a
Parliamentary or municipal election shall be dis-
qualified from being selected for the seven years next
following.
But, of course, that’s a real wicked offence.
One day last week Acting-Prime Minister
Watt blew himself up to say that had he
been in power when the war began he would
have been inclined to advise putting the
country in the hands of a Committee of
Public Safety. Well, when The Bulletin
considers the Norton Griffiths business, the
meat price-fixing joke, the wheat muddle, the
shipping co.’s profits, the tariff-wall amend-
ment proposals, the profiteering in our
midst and sundries, it cordially agrees with
Mr. Watt. And if he can suggest a Robes-
pierre as chairman it will have a greater
admiration for him than ever.
As Russia’s Bolshevik rulers shifted for
safety from one place and another, leaving
the Bolshevik mob in charge, a great deal of
compromising correspondence was left be-
hind. Also a great deal was brought away
from the country by persons who fled from
the reign of terror, and some was found in
abandoned consulates and embassies. A col-
lection has been published in the U.S. The
fact stands out that Lenin, Trotsky and co.
were hired by Germany, their revolution
financed by Germany, their plans devised by
Germany and carried out by German officers,
and the members of their central executive
committee selected by Germany. And seeing
that a certain Federal politician has been
demanding recognition as Bolshevik repre-
sentative in Australia, it is up to him to
say by whom he was selected. Didn’t lu 1
know anything about the Government he
represented ?
Brighton’s representative in Vic. Assem-
bly, O. Robinson Snowball, advocates
economy, yet derides the “saving of a paltry
£lO,OOO or £12,000 a year” now spent on the
State Excellency and his outfit. Certainly
£12,000 is only a trifle among the huge sums
wasted by Australian Governments; still
it’s £12,000. and you can do a few odd jobs
with that sum coining in annually. For in-
stance, the Vic. Government is about to pull
up and use the rails on the long-disused
Fawkner-Somerton line, another “perma-
nent and reproductive work.” The £12,000
now thrown into a cocked hat would pay the
interest on Somerton’s dead horse, and in a
few years completely wipe out the indebted-
ness. Then the State would have the £12,000
every year plus the saved interest to redeem
the debt on other dismantled lines. But
Snowball rolls himself along too hurriedly to
notice these paltry facts.
The workers at Cullen Bullen colliery
(N.S.W.) probably never gave any special
attention to shipbuilding and the need for a
uniform railway gauge, they being an inland
folk and far from the madding border-line.
'Yet these two matters threaten to lose Cul-
len Bullen its job. The Victorian Govern-
ment can’t get much coal in the old way by
sea for lack of ships, and coal by rail is
dreadfully expensive, partly by reason of the
fact that the N. S. Wales 4ft. Slim truck
doesn’t fit the Victorian sft. Bin. railway.
So the Railway Department at Melbourne,
which used to buy from Cullen Bullen, has
decided to live on its coal reserves for a while
in the hope that its own mines may develop
further before it gets to the end of them.
Thus do all-Australian problems rise up
and smite Cullen Bullen in its seclusion.
The Government has been asked to do some-
thing; but it should have been asked 20
years ago.
THE BOLSHEVIKS
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The Bolsheviks of Petrograd
I will admit are pretty bad.
For murder, arson, theft and rape,
Or crime in any kind or shape
That’s furbished up with blood and noise
They seem to be the dinkum boys.
Their Government’s a crazy sham;
They’ve no religion worth a d—n;
They’re “ringers” on the “Frightful'’ lay,
And when they start there’s Hell to pay!
Their “right” is wrong; their “wrong” is right.
But—well, thev’re not afraid to fight !
*
T don’t admire these Bolsheviks,
Nor any of their Ilunnish tricks;
But when they start to kill and loot
They know the other side can shoot.
They’re game to take a risk, of sorts,
And, so far, you can call them “sports.”
The Bolsheviks of Petrograd
Are drunk with blood, and howling mad.
They’re just a useless, rotten lot
That don't deserve the luck they’ve got.
I’d like to see them all wiped out
By ball and bay’net, rope and knout;
But there are other Bolsheviks
Who more deserve Australia’s kicks—
'Hie traitors to their native land
Who fain would join that bloody band
And drag their country in the muck,
But that they haven’t got the pluck 1
They fear to fight; they hate to work;
They love to bask and bray and shirk.
“Negotiation” is their cry
What time their brothers bleed and die.
These Bolsheviks, they make me sad.
They’re worse than those of Petrograd !

H ROUGH OUT the History
of the player-piano the Pianola
has been the leader —the in-
strument without a peer.
The infinite variety of touch —'the rich
tonal effects —-the almost limitless range of
musical expression it makes possible
have brought the Pianola the patronage
and endorsement of the great musicians, of
the leading educators, of the men and
women foremost in every walk of hie.
Such universal recognition is won only by
distinctly superior quality —by unqualified
supremacy in all essentials.
Pianola perfection is a product of many
minor perfections, but a few of its features
are outstanding and revolutionary.
The Metrostyle is an instance. This
wonderful tempo control is unapproached
in effectiveness. It aids the novice in
music to utilise with fine artistic effect the
wonderful technical resources of the Pianola
—this by guidance of the famous “red

“McFacl”: The sectarian scrap here in
Maoriland is a sore puzzle to our simple brown bro-
ther. I ran into Henare Hapuka in Wanganui the
other day. Henare was supporting his usual verandah
post, puffing clouds of thick pungent smoke from his
short clay. His eyes lit up as he saw me. “Tena-
koe, poss, I want you terra me. I want you terra
me ’pout te fight, te Katerik an’ te Protitan’. Py
korri, I toan unnerstan’. Long, long time ago te

t ink he send te Maori missin’ry ’mong te pakeha.”
* * * *
“Will Lawson”: The phrase “gone west,”
used so much during this war, is not a new one
in the language of the Maori, though he does not
say it quite in that way. The Maori religion pro-
vides no such place as Hell. A person gets his or
her deserts in this life and afterwards goes by “the
bioad path of Tane,” i.e., the track of the setting sun,
to a huge meeting-house where are gathered the
sculs of all the departed. There they will wait till
members of all the tribes and ha pus and families
who are still on earth have joined them, when all
will move on to whichever heaven they are bidden
to go. There are 12 heavens in the Maori’s myth-
ology. And the course which leads to any of them
is due west.
“Jim Carew” : A couple of years ago 1 did
some coasting along “No Man’s Coast.” We started
from Port Darwin and called at Port Kssingtoir,
Malay Bay and Blue Mud Bay. Some of the natives
are copper-colored, some yellow and some almost
white. Traces of the Chow are also plentiful. The
males are big, strapping fellows, nearly all over 6ft.,
and a sft. Gin. female is considered stumpy. They
are not had-looking, either. The nose is thin and
aquiline, the smile pleasing, the teeth perfect and the
lips thinner than is usually noticed in a Binghi.
Leprosy is common. Some authorities blame a too-
continuous fish diet ; others say the disease is in-
herited from the Malays. Venereal disease is also
horribly prevalent. For some years on the coast a
lugger collected Customs duties from the visiting
Malays, but as the job did not pay expenses it was
discontinued. When the men from the North arrive
there is a great jamboree, and gin, opium and spirits
are given in exchange for girls. The coast is rich in
turtle, trepang and fish. Crocodiles abound, and in
the interior there are plenty of wildfowl, buffalo and
other game. It is a grand trip for a sporting party.
The guns and a camera would easily pay the
expenses.
“M.” : Allow me to add a word to “Cori-
bard’s” eulogy of the kurrajong (B. 22/8/’18).
Apart from this vegetable’s highly ornamental appear-
ance and its undeniable value as a shade tree, its
worth as a stand-by for stockowners in time of
drought should be sufficient to encourage all dinkum
Australians to take an interest in its
welfare. During a big drought on the
Clarence River I saw hundreds of cattle
sustained by the foliage of kurrajong
alone. Stock preferred it to apple-tree
and oak, which are considered titbits in
droughty times. The excellent quality of
Binghi’s fish-nets and dilly-bags, made of
the bark fibre of both brown kurrajong
and the more gaily-flowered (hibiscus)
varieties, suggests many possibilities for
the vegetable as a fibre and paper pro-
ducer. Besides, there is 1.8 per cent, more
caffeine in the seed than in an equal
weight of the coffee of commerce, and as
they are produced in abundance there is
good reason for advocating the cultiva-
tion of the species. The trees will grow
almost anywhere. I have seen them on
land that would not carry a nanny-goat
to the acre—fine, leafy vegetables that
would grace a multi-millionaire’s carriage-
drive. Bushmen say that the vegetable rarely dies
from natural causes, which is another very strong
point in its favor.
“Billy the Dodger”: Years ago the last
corroboree of the Lachlan (N.S.W.) blacks was held
across the river from Condobolin. Jimmy Cobden,
probably named after Cobden, of Micabil, a nephew
of the old Corn Law favorite, wore the metal insignia
of majesty and stage-managed the weird performance.
Hundreds of enthusiastic townsfolk witnessed the
gyrations of the dozen or so binghis, and prepared to
recompense them with substantial rewards. Jimmy
took up the collection. With a yawning chaffbag he
threaded his way through the throng of spectators
pleading: “Gibbit som’t’ing for the blackpfella.”
They did. Small and large parcels, neatly tied up,
which looked like gifts of tea, sugar or flour, fell
into the bagging. Several bottles, heavy with liquor,
were also contributed, and a shower of what
appeared to be “tixpenees” was passed into an old
billycock hat carried by his Maj. In ecstasy he
yelled to the leaping niggers: “Keep up the plurry
corroboree; I rnakeit mine forchun.” When the last
onlooker had contributed, a pompous, pride-swelled
monarch strode into the circle of firelight and
emptied the contents of bag and hat to the ground.
What had looked like coin proved to be trouser-
buttons and tobacco-tags ; the bottles contained any-
thing but grog, and the neatly-tied parcels were full
of dirt. A spear suddenly whirled among the flames
of the bonfire and the crackling' pine sticks were scat-
tered over the heads of the wondering dancers.
Angrily the Emperor yelled, pointing to the collec-
tion : “Stop th’ plurry corroboree; plurry larrikins
ruin me.” The crowd escaped unhurt.

the Australian aborigines were four convicts, George

“Ida D.”: “Merrigal” gave me a gentle
rebuke (B. 29/8/’18), Notwithstanding X still main-
tain that Tomingley is out of bounds as a native
place-name, as one has to dig for the meaning. As
he is probably a more energetic student than I am, I
wonder if he can give me the original meaning of
Wirra-billa (Kamilaroi) ? 1 can get no further than
that it has “something to do with twisting the fish-
ing-lines.” “Moongulla,” it appears, is not a native
name,, though I would not go nap .oh that being
correct; but the old blacks cal] it Gurr-weh-harma,
meaning “long hands.”
“Jim Carew” : I had one coaching, experi-
ence with Billy Doyle (B. 5/9/’18), ami I don’t want
another. On this day 1 was the only passenger, and
Billy was in a reckless mood. Instead of following
the road as he usually did, at North Bourke he turned
to the right and tore across the common full gallop.
Heaven’s watt htower only knows how many stumps we
" T ent over and how we escaped being upset. By good
luck we turned into the town, knocking only one
verandah-post over, and then the horses bolted pro-
perly. Away we went with half the population of
Bourke yelling behind us. The performance finished
about 200 yards from the railway station. One of
the leading horses fell and the coach ran right on top
of it. Quite unperturbed, Billy got down, and, taking
no notice of the crowd, sorted things out. Then he
got back on the “box" and invited me to rejoin him.

‘Melos” : Many of our birds, gucli as the
reed warbler, the little grass-bird, black and white
fantail and bush lark, sing reg’ularly at night.
During the mating season the blue wren occasionally
charms the night air with his delightful music. The
magpie, too, at times, breaks into song when most
of the other members of the choir are in the land
of dreams. Many bush-dwellers contend that mag's
nocturnes denote fine weather. The persistent calls
of the coachwhip and the satin-bird, they say,
herald the coming of wet weather. Another har-
binger of wetfulness is the black cockatoo. His
prophecy of rain causes the bush fires.
“D.F.”: A very rare “beaked” whale,
reckoned the first of its kind to be recorded from the
Speck, came ashore at Recherche (Tas.) recently, and
Prof. Flynn, of the Tasmanian University, has the
complete skeleton of it. The beaked whales have
the skull projecting forward something like the beak
of a bird, and are a -sort of cousin of the sperm
whale, built on a Small scale. They have only two
teeth in the lower jaw, and in this little stranded
fellow, who was only 18ft. long-, these two had
hardly been cut. The fisherman who boiled down
the blubber got 53 gallons of oil "out of it.

“Pick” : One place in which the ungainly
bittern may be found numerously is among the
swamps of the South Coast (N.S.W.). An unknown
stranger, he arrived ‘ there during the droughty
seasons of 1901-2, and his weird booming, among the
reeds revived among the bingliis many a long-ago tale
of the bunyip. Also, the unusual row set many a

plentiful and well known, and apparently the locality
suited him, for he stayed there.

THE HOME-COMING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The wattle’s glint is bright to-day,
Sweet odors tang the summer air,
His bird-pals never were so gay —
They’re singing welcomes ev’r.vwhere.
Now Bill, since shards of shrapnel spun
In France, must “dot and carry one.”
’Tis four years since Bill went away
With boundin’ hopes an’ throbbiu' heart,
Intendin’ in war’s game to play
The strong Australian soldier’s part,
An’ well enough he’s helped to spoil
An’ put the Fritzes ’neath the soil.
Young Vic., the boss’s second sou,
Came home from school his prad to mount
For lone patrols across the run,
An’ put his wage in Bill’s account.
An’ now Bill’s limpin’ home again
To lay the fox an’ dingo bane!
His little hut beside the creek
The womenfolk have furbished up;
His mare an’ dog are lookin’ sleek
(They never lacked for bite or sup),
An’ many a pig an’ poultry pen
Are gifts from shy and whiskered men.
An there’s a bright bush lass we know
(A drover’s daughter o’er the rise),
Whose blushes make her brown cheeks glow
While love-gleams light her soft brown eves....
We’ve tipped the priest Bill’s splicin’ fee
An’ cobbers will provide the spree!
Of course we know ol’ Bill will swear
A hurricane at all the fuss.
Well, let him. We ain’t goin’ to care.
Since he went forth to fight for us
Our admiration fails for breath,
For Bill’s been cobbers close with Death!
MERELY POLITENESS.
“You were a good little boy not to swear just
now when yon fell down.”
“Mister, if you 'adn’t bin ’ere you’d ’a' ’card
me!”
Bill’s home again ! A battered bloke,
With limbs askew an’ gammy leg.
He thinks his scars a boske.r joke
An’ shares our' smiles to see him peg
Around with nimble, limpin’ gait,
Layin’ the fox an’ dingo bait!
He shows us what the Germans do ;
He’s told us what it’s like to feel
A dingo Prussian stalkin’ you
To let you get a taste of steel—•

They shot the dog ’fore he got near.”

STRENGTH!
Every detail of a farm engine must be built to stand continuous hard work. It must be able to stand
up” under severe strains and hard usage. It must operate under all conditions, miles away from repair
shops or service stations. That is why
ENGINES
are so popular in every corner of Australia. The Cooper is an ideal engine ror
the hard, rough work about the farm. It is powerfully constructed, easy to
operate, very reliable, and is built and sold especially for farm and station use.
Cooper Engines are fitted with fuel pump, quick start magneto and
highest quality attachments. Cylinders and valve chambers have ampie water
jackets, and the large water tanks keep them cool in all climates.
For driving sheep-shearing machinery, pumping plants, chaffcutters, sawing
sets or any other machinery requiring power a Cooper is the engine tor the job.
Due to their sterling qualities, their output has grown to such tremendous pro-
portions as to reduce the cost of manufacture considerably, and Cooper engines
can be purchased at prices much lower than any other engines of equal quality.
Write us your requirements and we will be pleased to quote you an engine suitable for the purpose.
COOPER ENGINES can be supplied by any of these weiEknown firms:

MAKE TAR SYRI’P FOR COUGHS
AND COLDS.
A WAR-SAVING RECIPE.
It is not generally known that an excellent
cough remedy can be quickly, easily and
cheaply made at home in a few minutes by
dissolving half a pound of sugar in half a
pint of boiling water and then stirring in
two ounces of Bitrate of Tar, which can be
obtained of any chemist at slight cost,
Bitrate of Tar Cough Syrup is as pleasant
to take as it is effective, and is therefore
especially suitable for children. The dose for
adults is one to two teaspoonfuls every hour
or two until the cough is cured; children
should take half as much. Thousands of
people used this war-time syrup last winter
with beneficial results, and every mother is
strongly advised to keep a bottle of Bitrate
of Tar Cough Syrup at hand. It is true that
it is a simple home-made remedy, but it has
proved most successful in relieving stubborn
coughs and colds. —Advt.

“Abel Pointon” : Re bunda bunda, bandy
bandy, or ring-snake. I have been hunting snakes’
for the last 50 years, and have come across a few of
the above, but no large specimen until a. few weeks
ago, when I caught one on Manurnbar station, Kin-
bombi (Q.), ancl sent it on to the Brisbane Museum,
the manager of which wrote to say that the snake
was a record for length, measuring 281 in., 2-lin.
longer than their best specimen.
“tJ.Y.E.” : Every wild thing has its play-
ful moments —even a deadly snake. On one expedi-
tion I caught a black devil about sft. long disporting
itself in a shallow surface-pool. The reptile had a
water-lily stem in its jaws, and was dragging and
tossing it about much after the fashion in which a
kitten plays with a ball of wool. A.snake, too, which
lias caught a frog 7 usually carries the squealing
amphibian about for some time before swallowing it.
This procedure is, of course, partly for purposes of
salivation, but it displays, also, a certain pride in
prowess, akin to that of a cat with a freshly-caught
mouse.

“Melos”: Tell '“Mnrago” (B. 2-7/li/MS-)
that the “correa” mentioned by “Kahbionba” is
probably the comparatively 7 rare, crimson-flowered
O. Laurenciana. A commoner member of this species
has yellowish green blooms. There are three other
varieties of correa. including the white flowering
alba, all suitable for hedge purposes.
“Melos”: I plump for the diamond-
sparrow (spotted diamond) and the barley-bird as
the two smallest Australian chooks. The adult of
each species measures a trifle over three inches in
length. The latter, though rare in most parts, is
common enough on the Richmond River,
“Azack”: Tell “Rags” (B. 5/9/T8). who
was making inquiries in regard to..the Australian
bittern’s new abode, that both varieties of the bird
(the ordinary and the thick-billed) are to be found
about Richmond (N.S.W.) and in districts along the
Hawkesbury River. The thick-billed species tackles
leaves and fruits, while it feeds on small fish and
shrimps. From an economic standpoint, the bittern
is considered a pest, because it destroys many young
fish. Naturally on the drying up of the swamps of
the Reedbeds (S.A.) they 7 departed.
“Eddyson” : Old Jo Crib always insisted
there was gold in Hobble Creek, and showed his
confidence by working it, in season and out, over a
distance of about a mile and a hllf. Hobble Creek
was narrow, deep and circuitous. It had bitten its
way between enormous rocks, and carried the cold
water from Pepper Caster, .the highest ridge of those
Gippsland hills. In winter the water stung like a
blister, and even in the hottest summer days it was
too cold for comfort. Yet old Jo Crib, now at leasr,
60, had worked at it for over 13 years every Satur-
day 7 afternoon and every Sunday of that time, and
often in the early morning for an hour o 7 r two
before tackling his ordinary grind at Pitted Tommy
Thompson's, Pitted Tommy being the only man of
substance in the district and the owner of an exten-
sive horse-breeding' concern spreading out over, the
lower landscape. The local impression was that Old
Jo was dippy about the auriferous nature of Hobble
Creek, and it was certainly true he hadn’t a -grain
of gold to show for his vigorous and protracted
dredging operations. But Crib was no subject for
a mental specialist ; he knew perfectly what he was
about, and had good grounds for the faith within
him. In fact when the police came to Castlebar
and collared -Snow and Holden for the big jewellery-
robbery7 they had pulled off in Melbourne a month
earlier, Holden, had manifested his gratitude for
favors received by whispering to Jo before the detec-
tive jumped him away: “The swag-—in a keg—
Hobble Creek!” Snow and Holden were convicted,
but the stolen watches, rings, chains, etc., were never
recovered, although the police rooted up the hut
adjoining Jo's, in which Snow and Holden had
lived, and searched every tree and rock within half
a mile. Holden died in gaol, and Snow disappeared
after serving his time, while Old Jo Crib continued
to prospect Hobble Creek with a quaint, hand-
dredging device of his own invention, long years of
failure having left him still hopeful and determined.
He knew what he was after. He had seen that
curious little wooden paint-keg in Holden’s posses-
sion. Then one day a son of Bill Barrett’s believing
Old Jo had a lien on everything in Hobble Creek,
told Crib of seeing a young swell who had come to
Pitted Tommy’s at Castlebar to look over a mob of
horses, while fishing in a pool above the hut. draw
uo an oid paint-keg from between two rocks, The
stranger's hook had fouled the keg. The boy,
watching from a distance, saw him break open the
keg with a stone. Jo plunged down in a distressing
and protracted frothing fit, and died of sheer dis-
gust with the blindness of fate a few weeks later,
overwhelmed by the idea of over 13 years of hard,
industrious and intelligent search having failed where
an egregious ass succeeded by chance in as many
minutes. Old Jo’s last words in hospital at Sale
were uttered in bitter protestation, “He got it
fisliin’ V” cried Jo. “FishiiT ! And there isn’t a fish
in 50 miles of Hobble Creek water!” Hardly a
month later a cute detective who had been tailing
Snow for some time jumped for him just as the hap-
less gaolbird was unearthing a rotted leather-bag
containing about £3700 worth of gold jewellery
and precious stones from the clay floor under the
bunk in Old Jo Crib’s hut !
“Billy T.”; Prince Peter’s reward for
having tracked, recovered and returned Snowball
Dinning’s big piteli-black bull at Tarrydown was the
bulbous old-fashioned silver watch Dinning had carried
for over 30 years, and which had been an object of
envious longing to Peter evei*sihce he was taken over
from his tribe at 15. Prince, now a buck of 21,
with a grin like a bucket ot snow in a • eqal-bin,
swelled up with exultation. He hung the watch about
his neck with a leather lace, and swaggered round
like a big bull turkey airing his tail. He took a
three-days’ trip into the interior to find his tribe,
merely to fill the whole clan with sick envy at the
•sight of his sacred possession, and moved his old
mother to. such pride and wonder that she
promptly died, and Prince Peter had to stay 7 for the
funeral rites. Peter sent a messenger to Tarry-
down, with his polite apologies and an explanation.
His absence would be protracted by this sad bereave-
ment, and when he had finished his lamentations it
was his intention to seek out another tribe with the
object of showing his watch to a certain fat young
blue-black lubra whose family had spurned his suit,
but who was expected to capitulate suddenly at the
sight of the chronometer. Prince Peter was away
for over a month. When lie returned he had the
blue-black lubra in tow 7 , and his grin was dazzling.
“Where your watch bin, Peter?” said Dinning. Peter
swept his shirt aside with a lordly gesture, and
pointed to a-quaint knob over bis ribs where the skin
had been slit for a length of 2}in. and worked away
from the flesh to make a pouch. “Mine bin put him
watchit belonga. watch-pocket all right,” said the
abo. proudly 7.
“1t.0.8.” : Battery horses get some quaint
names. This is the list for our sub-section: Nugget,
Pudden. Molly, Cohen, Tony, Angelina, Jimmy,
Oopazooties, Turmoil, Windsucker, Misery, Biddy,
Phyllis, Icecream, Flour and Bakin’ Powder, Wooden-
head, Sylvia, Canary-legs, Bullet-head and Blackie.
We have two- mules also; but their names are not
publishable.
“Wart’ - : These are some of the names
which the extinct Tasma iiian black fellow gave to
birds: Firetail, pootherenmer ; pigeon, larrenai'; alba-
tross, tarriua : any small bird; muta muta; cockatoo,
crriba : black cockatoo, noingmuia ; crow, lina ; wild
duck drake, malbena ; eagle, liairana; emu, rekura;
gahnet, crupena.;. Cape Barten goose, robenganna;
gull, rowennanna ; hawk, pueta ; eagle-hawk, cow-
eena ; magpie, cauura ; parrakeet, mola; parrot, ear-
raca; pelican, lanaba ; mutton-bird, ilia; sparrow-
hawk, gan henen lienen. Nearly all the names are
full of vowel music, and all except the last one end
with an a-sound. There is a predominance of sea-
birds’ names in this list, and the reason of that is
that most of .the vocabularies were collected after the
blacks were in captivity on Flinders Island, where, of
course, sea birds were most in evidence.
* # * *
“M.P.”: Strange how little notice birds
take of the heavy gunfire at the Front nowadays.
Have frequently seen grouse in close proximity to the
front-line trenches ; on several occasions only a couple
of-hundred yards in rear. In the Ypres sector, where
the guns are never quiet, skylarks are a common
sight. Have only seen one exception—a carrier
pigeon which was so dazed by the noise and con-
cussion during the attack on Polygon AVood that it
refused to fly when liberated.
“Musketoon”: Tenders are hereby called for
a better record than that compiled by a crossbred ewe
owned by E. E. Rawlins, of Forbes (N.S.W.). This
dame, although white, has given birth to twin black
lambs three seasons in, succession. And, while you’re
at it, there’s a lady 'sheep owned by Tom Strick-
land, of Bundaburra, Forbes (N.S.W.), which in four
seasons has produced 10 lambs, as follows: 1915,
three ; 1916, tw T o ; 1917, three; and this year, two.
All these lambs are white.

Word to say for thepi all except the Turk.
Especially he admires the Persian—the real
one; not" the cosmopolitan robbers who in-
test the land—as one of nature’s gentlemen
only lacking in the instinct of self-govern-
ment and too much disposed to Peace Society
ways. The Armenian of the country dis-
tricts he describes as a great fighter
and a great lover of liberty. In
fact. tlie Armenian loves liberty so
much that among the Armenian volun-
teers who accompanied the Russian army it
was hardly possible for anything to be done
until everybody was agreed. Mr. Price saw
the beginning of the Russian revolution m
these parts when everyone was a brother
and all races and faiths lay down together
and didn’t cut each other’s throats in their
sleep. He didn’t wait for the second phase
when the Bolshevik hooligans came in on
one side and the Turks on the other, and
the- brothers who had already relapsed some-
what from (heir brotherhood fell on evil

The Inky Way
“Bill Bowyang” ; There are several good
black-and-white artists with the Australian
and Maori la nd forces in Palestine, and the
majority of them have made sketches of
their travels. A representative of the Sar-
geant Art Gallery, Wanganui (M.L.), is
hustling around in Cairo endeavoring to
secure these sketches for his institution.
The A.I.F. War Museum Section has also
an eve on the drawings. Sergeant Otho
Hewitt, late of S.A., carries about with him
a fine collection of paintings of historic
spots over which Billjim has fought, and
Dave Barker, of “Anzac Book” fame, has
also many clever pen sketches of Anzac and
Mesopotamia. It’s up to some Australian
institution to inquire in a hurry about these
drawings, for they won’t be purchasable
soon.
Lieut. Leslie Buchanan, killed in France
on September 5, had trodden the Inky A ay
in Perth, Melbourne, Sydney and Queens-
land. After several vicissitudes he had estab-
lished himself in Queensland in the pleasant
job of editor of the long-established Darling
Downs Gazette (Toowoomba), but un-
hesitatingly gavw up the chair to answer the
call. He was with the sth Division in all
the heavy fighting from March to September,
1917, wrote with unfailing cheerfulness of
weeks under shell-lire, and ne\ r er lost a
chance of praising the men of his battalion —
the 31st. He was wounded in May in front
of Dernancourt, but remained on duty. In
his 42nd year when the end came.
Indirectly, at least. Australian literature
owes something to William Steele, who died
in Melbourne the other day, for in his capa-
city of Australasian manager for Ward, Lock
and Co., the publishers, he lent a helping
hand to a good many local writers, including
Ethel and Lilian Turner, Mary Grant Bruce.
Donald Macdonald and Vera Dwyer, all of
whom had books accepted by his firm. Steele
was with the co. for 51 years, and founded
the Melbourne branch 34 years ago. Hand-
some “Billy” Steele, who plays for Melba'
whenever she requires an organ-accompani-
ment, is a son of the dead publisher.
THE TRIUMPH OF PAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Poor Cliff I met long years ago,
A writer for the press,
A mail, it seemed, of endless woe,
Who lived on little, there, I know:
Thereafter lived on less.
Yet wielded quite a glowing pen —
I loved his nimble fancy then.
His stories were not bad at all,
His verse was always fine.
Why should the duns so often call?
Why was he always at the wall?
A sparkle as of wine
•Ran in his flowing prose, but prose
Is not a di ink, howe’er it flows.
One ddy for lunch he bade me stop.
He wanted me to see
His plan for saving every drop
Of succulence that’s in a chop.
“Necessity,” said he,
“Forced this contrivance, truth to tell.
My friend, it even saves the smell.”
Cliff disappeared. That he’d gone out
AVas long my sad surmise.
Last week he passed, well-clad and stout,
He drove a shining car about,
And now I am more wise—
His vivifying pen they ban,
But all are worshippers of Pan!
VICTOHIA.
BILLY T.
A Satchel of Books
A Second Diary of the Great Warr, by Samuel
Pepys, junior, is a rather dreary imitation of the
writer whose name is borrowed. Nothing is easier
to copy than the old Pepys, with his pleasant mixing,
up of domestic episodes, social happenings and affairs
of State —in which last he was personally concerned.
And in the same way nothing is easier «to copy than
an old master ; the trouble is that the result is apt
to look like the work of a young servant. Samuel I.
kept a genuine record for his own use of his own
quaint observant body and soul, and part at least of
it (probably there was much more) was found in
dog-eared manuscript in an old and dog-eared college,
and published 122 years after he was dead. Samuel
11., writing in haste for money and publication,
lacks the charm of realism, and possibly he also lacks
the soul. John Kettlewell’s illustrations are good.
(John Lane, London, publisher.)
Poems, by Geoffrey Dearmer (Heinemann, London).
Good soldier verses by a man who has enough vision
to see beyond the raw-beef side of war. The sonnets
are poor, - but some of the other lyrical pieces sing.
A striking stanza: —
“Was this a dream? Yet, Mary Saw the sky,
Lit by a vision from the darkness hurled ;
A little dream that made a baby cry—
A dream that saved the world.”
A pleasant book of sincere verse which climbs just
above mediocrity.

Alleged that two Victorians have worked
out a line of 80 fast dyes from a waste by-
product of eucalyptus-distillation; and that
Acting-Prime Minister Watt has promised
to help them in their research-work. John
Fraser, a Bendigo chemist, is one of the dis-
coverers, and Alexander Menesdorfer, who
lives the simple inventor’s life at the village
of St. Alban’s, on the Iveilor Plains, is liis
collaborator. Fraser has been dispensing in
Bendigo these many years, while Menes-
dorfer has for several decades been known
in Melbourne as a patron of the Patent
Office.

“Malaysia”: It is apparent to those who
know something of Far Eastern ‘markets
that Australia is not getting anything like
its fair share of the trade in manufactured
articles. I attribute this in a* great measure
to the woeful ignorance of our manufac-
turers. Let them take a map and look at
the distance to Java, Sumatra, Singa-
pore and Penang, and compare it with the
distance from the European manufacturing
countries. We are much closer to them
by a good deal, and our ships have no heavy
Canal dues to pay on the way there as those
from Europe have. This means our freight
charges would be less. Let that sink in. In
pre-war days those markets were flooded
with German goods. At present none are
arriving. In Singapore and Penang there
are no wholly Australian concerns which
are occupied in pushing our manufactures.
There are one or two dabblers in Australian
trade there, whose main income is from
goods manufactured anywhere but in Aus-
tralia. If we are to progress (and inciden-
tally pav our war bill) the methods employed
to capture trade in the Far East must be
improved upon. Either our export houses
must start their own branches, or our manu-
facturers must combine and place their sole
selling rights in the hands of anyone who is
willing to go there and stay there for some
years to get them a fair share of the trade.
For each manufacturer to send a traveller
who doesn’t settle there and get to know his
Chinese and other buyers is just a. waste
of good energy and money. The trade is done
as long as the traveller is there. W hen he
returns, and the pushing is left to agents
with European interests, the trade falls off.
Australian manufacturers make articles
which are as good as any in the world, and
they can capture a very large portion of the
Far Eastern trade if they will only wake up
to the fact that those markets are asking for
the goods.
The lady was explaining her financial
position to the court at Cairns: —
I have a small property. The first money T paid
on the ground was the baby bonus earned by my
husband.

“L.”: When the animal industry branch of
the Lands Department received a good word
from “Boree” (B. 12/9/’IS), he apparently
had not inquired very far into the matter.
The calf-saving scheme is based on the ridi-
culous assumption that the cow-cocky knocks
Baldy’s baby on the head because it is too
nucli trouble to rear. When a cocky de-
c-fines to poddy a calf it is because it
wouldn’t live anyhow. The Minister’s scheme
is probably to cherish these culls, and his ex-
periments commence at Raymond Terrace
and Albion Park. Land at these centres is
to he leased, a 40-acre block for the run.
Sheds and other necessary buildings will he
erected at the cost of the Department, and a
couple of men will be installed to nurse the
infants. The manager of an adjacent fac-
tory is to be paid to act as a sort of general
adviser. For the first few weeks the calf
will get fresh milk, and will then be gradually
switched on to the butter-milk. A certain
amount of meal, maize and hay will also be
fed to the animals, and the cost to the farmer
will be 2s. 6d. per week. As the course lasts
for 16 weeks the total cost of rearing will
be £2 ; but Ashford's department takes the
risk of losses. If the cocky desires to sell
the calf just after it is dropped, the Minister
will buy it outright for 255. and take the
chance of pulling it through. The weakness
of the scheme lies in the diet. Butter-milk,
taken from factory vats, will not feed and
fatten calves. Pigs, with their phenomenal
stomachic capabilities, will not do too well
on it and must have a supplementary diet
of grain. Experts have tried out the calves
on it and found that the butter-milk scours
severely, and in most cases causes death un-
less other sustaining foods are added. It
w'll probably mean that Ashford will end
up by feeding his poddies on arrowroot bis-
cuits or patent groats, and this is probably
the reason that induced him to entrust the
experiment to a fruit-and-wheat expert
instead of to an officer of the dairy branch.
* * * *
“Trocas”: According to James Clark,
sometimes called the Pearl King, Australia
produces about 00 per cent, of the world s
pearl-shell. This is due largely to the ex-
alted size of the Australian pearl-oyster, and
the proportion does not hold good with
pearls. Our oyster may be anything up to
a foot across, and the pearl-oyster of
Ceylon or the Persian Gulf is a dwarf by
comparison. James wants to know why,
having a practical monopoly of the raw
material, we should send it all away and
import the buttons and studs made from it.
He believes he has a promise that if he can
get the industry going as a branch ot repatri-
ation the Australian market will be reserved
for it. Then he wants to know why, if we can
make our own buttons, we cannot make
other people’s and export the shell made up.
Someone will be trying to apply the same
revolutionary principle to wool yet.
* * * *
It is a common delusion with the
business man that long usage sanctifies
dishonesty, hence the perfectly sincere indig-
nation- of the dranery trade in Victoria at.
not being allowed to describe adulterated
cloth as “flannel.” Webster’s Dictionary
defines flannel as “a soft, nappy, woollen
cloth of loose texture,” but for over 109
years the trade has applied the name to all
inferior mixture of cotton and wool, m
which very often the cotton predominates.
Some' time ago Justice Cussen decided that
flannel should consist of about 97 per cent,
wool, and ever since Victorian rag merchants
have been trying to sidestep by using the
label “flannel” with a qualifying
When Agar Wynne was Attorney-General
the Master Drapers’ Ass. tried to get him
to agree to “union flannel,” and Wynne com-
promised by sanctioning the use of “mixture
flannel.” When the Dawson Government
arrived the fluff merchants were notified that
the use of any Libel containing the word
“flannel” to describe something that was not
flannel was taboo, but Fluff can’t drop bis
bad habits. The latest conviction recorded
was against a big Prahran firm that was soll-
r><v the same old mixture as “natural flan-

“E.M.8.”: The other day in Melbourne I
wanted a lamp-glass, common garden variety.
2!in. diameter, so I went to the nearest
shop having a china and hardware depart-
ment. I obtained what I wanted, and in
paying complained about the price, an in-
crease of 9d. since last I made a similar
purchase. The shopman said : “Madam, there
is a war on.” I felt distinctly squashed. On
reaching home my feeliiVgs can be imagined
when on taking the wrappings off I discov-
ered the glass to be bearing the inscription,
“Made in Germany”!
* * * *
“D.8.C.”: I fully endorse “Spark’s” re-
marks (B. 13/6/T8) as regards the
salaries paid to wireless-operators. As
“Spark” states, the wireless-operator on a
merchant vessel has, as often as not, the
safety of the ship in liis hands, and the
Admiralty book of instructions to mercantile
wireless-operators solemnly reminds him of
his great responsibility. Yet wireless and
shipping cos. offer operators, who have
spent anything between £2O and £4O in
technical instruction, in order to obtain their
first-class certificate, and who, in a large
number of cases, have had considerable ex-
perience in some associated profession, a
salary which in many cases is two or three
pounds per month lower than that of the
unskilled youth who signs on as a second-
class steward, or that of an ordinary fire-
man. The formation of the Radio-Telegrapli-
ists’ (Marine) Institute of Australasia cer-
tainly shifted my pay from £8 per month to
£11; but even now I’m only £1 ahead of the
second-class steward.

One of the Melbourne wool-selling
firms had a laugh the other day. The
consistent neatness with which the accounts
for his clip had been rendered called for
comment, so Merino fired this at the mana-
ger : “I don’t know the name of the clerk
who makes un mt r accounts, but his initials
are ‘E. and O. E.’”

Australian distributors of Yankee motor-
cars may expect a slump in their busi-
ness shortly, judging by the recent state-
ments of Cheney (representative of Dodge
Bros, at Adelaide!, who has just returned
from the U'.S. He says that most of the
manufacturers over there have been doing
their utmost to assist the Government in
making munitions, but some have neglected
their duty, and because of these the Govern-
ment has issued an order that, to obtain
supplies of steel and coal, a motor-maker
must turn his plant into a hundred per cent,
war factory from January 1 next. The
output of cars has already seriously fallen
off, and it looks as if exportations will before
long be stopped altogether. If so. Aus-
tralian distributors will be counted out..
However, there’s hope yet, for since the war
we have proved such wonderful capabilities
in manufacturing ships, aeroplanes, etc.,
that a comparatively small thing likfij a
motor-car will be easy. I
THE IMPORTANCE' OF BEING SMITH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Smith is a medicine man
Who in a suburb dwells,
And sometimes lengthy letters writes
About its streets, or smells.
Which news-short papers publish with
The signature “J. William Smith.”
His largest measurement is round
A very ample girth ;
And people say that William is
A man of solid worth;
He's certainly a man of weight;
And he believes it’s as they state.
When first I took the mansion where
I sling my bed each night,
The agent said in awe-struck tones:
“Old Smith lives to the right!”
And I’ve a strong presentiment
They charge it extra in the rent.
Each tradesman, as he called, remarked,
To clinch his bid for trade:
“I’m serving Mister Smith, you know!”
it small impression made,
Yet now I see it marches with
The great import of being Smith!
I joined in with a local crowd
On some small matter bent;
And it was doubtful who would make
A likely president,
Till someone let out with a run:
“J. William Smith is just the one!”
I, as a humble man, have fame
Folk often say; “I know !
You live next door to Mr. Smith!”
The name where’er I go
Is honored. It is Smith-lane where
My humble dustbin taints the air.
And yet this Smith (I have known Smiths
Quite gifted in their way.
I spree with them, and frequently
I laugh at what they say)
Round whom they dance their grave can-can
Is a most ordinary man !
His speech is stupid, dense and dull;
His thoughts are simply nil;
He takes his views all ready made—
As if each were a pill.
Yet sane folk fight with kin and kith
Who dare to doubt the words of Smith!
He’s gone to town each day at nine
Except on Sunday, when
He walks (10.30) to the church
With a presumptuous hen,
Who seems to be demented with
The pride of being queen to Smith.
ABROAD.

The Tails have marked down Pshaw’s
“Doctor’s Dilemma” for their first venture in
Repertory production. The play will be
given at the Palace (Sydney) about tbe
middle of October, and will be interpreted by
a qualified cast probably recruited from the
co. which the firm has secured for “The Eyes
of Youth.”
“Burrundie” : I’ll back Darwin’s picture-
show (N.T.) to beat anything in the Com-
monwealth for variety of audience. First
come the niggers and their gins sporting
pipes, turkey-red and every other hue in
clothing. Then there’s the half-castes—
brown, tan and brindle- —escorting their bits
of skirt. Malay pearlers appear in sarongs
and head-cloths. Jap divers look natty in
starched chokers, accompanied by country-
women who practise the oldest profession.
Dagos, Spaniards and Patagonians hog into
lemonade and peanuts. Chinks squat and
babble all over the place, with yellow kids
running wild. Manila men with dozens in
the family loom up. Russians make rowdy
BUSINESS AS USUAL.

over a dozen of beer, and Maltese jabber
ceaselessly. Swedes and Danes swell the
throng. Egyptians and Turks are common,
likewise Swiss (only known as such since
the war). The inevitable Yank, mostly from
Woolioomooloo, nourishes. Fritz runs, under
the Swedish or Swiss nationality. The mix-
up is leavened with a sprinkling of Britisher
representing the haighcst official circles.
“Melb”: “Lucretia Borgia,” Hugo’s most
powerful drama, and Donizetti's richest
opera, now on the film at Melb., has not been
very familiar, as a play, in Australia. The
last performance I recall was in Sydney, with
Mary Gladstane and Nat Douglas, who
revelled in Gennaro. He was a fine actor,
and his Belphegor was almost as good as
Dillon’s. Mary Gladstane must not be con-
founded with Caroline Gladstone, who died
recently in Melbourne. The “Lucretia Bor-
gia” opera was a favorite with Lucy Escott
and Squires. The last Melbourne perform-
ance I trace was in the Bijou, by Montague
and Turner.
“L.H.P.”: The Carl Rosa Opera Co. re-
cently celebrated its jubilee in June at the
London Shaftesbury. The troupe dates
from 1869. Rosa started the show first in
America, and then went to England, where
he has been on the job ever since. The first
London season was at the Princess’s in
1875, when the co. opened with “The Mar-
riS&e of Figaro,” with Charles Santley and
Rose Hersee among the principals. The
manager’s earliest contract was dated June
23, 1869, and was the engagement of Rose
Hersee, who was with William Lyster’s
Opera Co. in Australia in 1879-1880." She
was our first “Carmen.” The Jubilee per-
formance consisted of acts from “Pagliacci,”
“Tales of Hoffmann,” and Nicolai’s “Merry
Wives of Windsor.” Rosa, who did much
to encourage Fogland composers, died in
1889, worth £78,000. Artists from his co.
who have been seen on the Australian oper-
atic stage include Rose Hersee, Mrs. Slap-
offski, Ella Russell, Marian Burton, Rita
Presano, Lempriere Pringle, Chas. Tilbury,
Wm. Pauli, Max Eugene, Arthur Howell,
E. C. Hedmondt and Geo. 11. Snazelle, while
on the concert platform we have had Sant-
ley, Ben Davies, Alec Marsh, Barton
McGuckin and Alice Esty. Amy Sherwin
and Florence Saville, Australians, have
been Carl Rosa stars. Richard Eckhold
(here with Quinlan) and our old friend
Slapoffski knew the show from the conduc-
tor’s desk.
Died of wounds in France early in Sep-
tember, Charles A. Ledward, a prominent
bass singer in Melbourne for some years. He
first came into the limelight by sweeping up
prizes at various competitions, and then turned
his attention to the professional stage. He
was a soloist with the Philharmonic, Lieder-
tafel and the defunct Orpheus Society, and
for a while he was the bass principal at St.
Patrick’s Cathedral. He had attained the
rank of lieutenant when the end came at the
age of 37.
“Silas”: Luther Bradley, the American
artist who at one time edited and illustrated
Melb. Punch, used to tell a story of a well-
known Australian actor who resided at the
same establishment with him for some
mouths. The actor (not then so eminent)
was playing heroic parts
in melodrama, and,
according to Bradley, had
developed an enormous
idea of his ability as a
result of his success in
situations calling for
enormous strength, great
acumen or superhuman
courage, while famili-
arity with villains of all
sorts had endowed him
with the greatest con-
tempt for the brood. One
night the hero came home
to supper with a black
eye like an over-ripe
purple plum, a damaged
nose and in his hand the
ruins of a full set of false
teeth. The actor ex-
plained : “Saw a low fel-
low assaulting a woman.
Attacked the hound—hurled him aside,”'
t hen, after a pause, while his tremulous
hand soothed the contused optic: “I give
you my word, this has never happened before
in 11 years!”
“S.T.S.”: Of .three one-act plays given by
Adelaide. Repertory Theatre, chief interest
centred in “A Woman Unknown,” by Alex.
Somerville (who is now known to lie Mel-
rose a local lawyer). It has a rather hard
brilliance. Husband and wife, although at
the last stage of incompatibility of tempera-
ment, have been to the theatre together,
missed their last train, and gone to his
bachelor fiat in the city for the night. The
wife’s previous tentative talk with her law-
•} er brother about a divorce had been taken
in professional earnest, and a private detec-
tive was on the job. In he comes on an easy
trail, and joyfully notes down the wife as a
woman unknown.” When this transpires
the absurdity of it appeals to the young
couple, and they fall into each other’s arms,
resolved to make a fresh start. The playlet
might be a slice of Pinero; anyhow, in" its
line it is quite equal to the average imported
article. Whittle was effective as the hus-
band. but clever- Ivy -Stacey has had parts
that suited her better. Stanley Houghton’s
play trifled with a similar idea. The
staid butler, called in to be a witness of
technical "cruelty” necessary for a divorce,
unexpectedly upends himself, knocks his
master down (respectfully) and offers him-
self (deferentially) as a reliable co-re. It is
like Shaw in his most frivolous vein, with
Gilbertian dialogue. Wilfred Neill, Kitty Sul-
livan and Ronald Simpson played effectively.
The gem of the evening was Gilbert Can-
nan’s "Everybody’s Husband,” a fantasy. A
girl, on the eve of her wedding, is inclined
to revolt, to dance away with a masked
pierrot into “the land of dreams.” To her
enter in turn three young matrons—her
mother, in the dress of 1891); grandmother,
with views as narrow as her crinoline is
wide; and great-grandmother, from the
Byron era, morals and costume alike. These
experts agree on only one point, that man is
a poor thing who must be deferred to but
humbugged, for his sake as well as for his
wife’s comfort. The amateur talent of the
Rep. Theatre has seldom been better shown
than in this play, with Zoe Reid, Muriel
Craigie, Etlielwyn Robin and Beryl Kook
together—all up to professional standard. In-
cidental music was composed and conducted
by Brewster Jones.
“Con D.”: Caruso had finished his song,
and as the audience sat spellbound a one-
armed Aussie leant over the dress-circle rail
and gesticulated wildly. “Hey, Trabasco!”
he yelled in a voice like a trombone, “Tra-
busco! Tra-bas-co!” A gold-laced official
took him by the shoulder kindly. “Pardon,
Monsieur Australie, that ees not Trabasco,
as you call heem. That ees the great Italian
tenor Caruso.” “D—n Caruso!” bawled the
Aussie, pointing down into the stalls exci-
tedly. "There’s old Trabasco Brown, from
Sydney ! Hey, Trabas !”

May, 1914. Which

her chance. Four
years ago she was
“third lady” with
the Royal Comics,
and made a very
dainty Phyllis Tup-
pit in the revival
under notice. Flo

and Olive Godwin
played Lydia.
‘Chanco”: Let the pedants grumble about
violiniste Leila Doubleday’s lack of platform
airs and graces. She appeals to me irresist-
ibly as a line Australian girl who refuses to
learn foreign frills either of dress or manners.
Her wholesomely independent style would
load one to believe she had Spent the past
10 years in her native bush, rather than
m the musical circles of Vienna. In-
stead of the stained-glass posing so common
with women fiddlers just before starting a
performance, Leila at times switches her bow
like a bush girl trying a new whip, and
braces the muscles of her arm in true back-
block style. Best of all is the breezv plat-
form manner which wholly cuts out the
conventional smirks and knee-drill. All this,
united to genuine talent that only lacks the
mellowness years and experience can give,
makes me rejoice.
“D.”: A recent “P.P.” story of Bellew’s
appointment with a young ladies’ seminary,
recalls Chas. Ryley’s account of his engage-
ment Avith the three Miss Blanks. Ryley
was then singing with Flo Graupner at Melb.
I rincess’s, and the letter came signed “The
Three Miss Blanks,” urging Chas. to take
Sunday tea with three forlorn sisters whose
chief delight during the past few weeks had
been in witnessing Mr. Ryley’s perfect act-
ing ahd listening to his beautiful voice. A
hotel friend told Ryley that the Blank trio
were the rich daughters of a man who had
had the savvy to alienate to himself several
blocks of what subsequently became enor-
mous valuable Melb. city ‘land. Charles
determined to take his Sunday evening meal
with the three rich little sisters, and he
found them delightful. They had an excellent
meal and spent a merry evening, the three
Miss Blanks being rather pretty girls, and
all under 30. At about half-past 10 the
drawing-room was suddenly invaded by a trio
of griffins, three large, bony, grim females, all
m black, and all in bonnets, at the sight of
whom the three charming hostesses screamed
&nd fled pellmell from the room, leaving
Ryley to explain as best he could. - To his
sincere disgust Ryley found he had been
entertained by two servants and a friend The
original and legitimate Miss Blanks had re-
turned home unexpectedly. They were the

“VANITY FAIR,” AT SYDNEY TIVOLI.
The Camille trio of comic acrobats at work.
“B. J.” : Frank Opitz, who passed out in
Melb. the other day, was at various times
showman, publican and Parliamentary candi-
date. His theatrical activities were in India,
where he ran a number of companies; and his
political bid was made as Labor candidate
for the East Melbourne seat in the Leg. Ass.,
when he and Henry Weedon were walloped by
A. A. Farthing. Years ago his widow (who
has the bar at Melb. Tivoli) warbled ballads
in vaudeville as Ada Mavin.
“Melb” : A refreshing change at the Audi-
torium, from the eternal Yankee feminine of
the picture shows. “Hinemoa,” taken in
Maoriland and splendidly acted entirely by
a large number of full-blooded Maori men and
women. No whites at all. The treat wasn’t
announced on the bills, and was put on only
as a sideshow, though really more interesting
than the main piece. The scenery is that -of
the volcanic region, the legend being illus-
trated with liakas and other rich extras.
HER RECOVERED YOUTH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
When she was eighteen, rather nice,
And dimpled like a gage,
She took an actor man's advice,
And went upon the stage.
She played the nurse to Juliet.
Whatever were her aims
At thirty-five she figured yet
As tat and ancient dames.
At forty, now grown rather staid,
Ambitious none the less,
As Juliet’s mamma she played,
And made a small success.
And for the next ten years or so
She kept herself alive
Depicting matrons, high or low,
Who ranged to thirty-five.
At fifty-four she made a hit
As charming Juliet.
She was, the critics must admit,
A fair, sweet Capulet.
Alas, she died at sixty-three.
They said, senile decay ;
Although in her profession she
Grew younger every day.

This private line links the i ,untry lying
between Deniliquin and the Murray with the
Victorian system. And that explains why it
is a private line —it would be against all
principles of statesmanship that the N. S.
Wales Government should run a railway to
feed the trade of the barbarians in another
State. However, the enterprise is not mak-
ing shareholders unduly fat. Profits depend
entirely upon the seasons, and the past year
has been the best experienced for some time,
and has permitted an increase of the divi-
dend rate to 6 p.c. Going back 15 years gives
this comparison:—
1903. 1917. 1918.
Liquid assets .. £9,793 £13,998 £18,932
Liabilities .. .. 30,693 353 749
Excess liabilities. . £20,900
Surplus assets .. £13,645 £18,183
So in addition to paying dividends —mostly
at the rate of 5 p.c.. though down to only
p.c. during the period following the big
drought—in 15 years the co. has worked off a
debenture debt of £20,000 and improved its
position by about £39,000 altogether. Mean-
time it has also paid for all repairs, renewals,
etc., out of profits. So by keeping the divi-
dend down the directors have improved the
co.’s position nicely. Capital is £125,000,
£25,000 of which represents reserves capital;
ised seven years ago; and £162.672 has been
laid out in permanent way, rolling stock, etc.
* * * *
“Quidam”: If anyone had suggested years
ago that coal deposits should not be alien-
ated from the State, few would have listened
to him. Yet to-day most people agree that
such an important national asset should have
remained in the hands of the nation, and
never have been made private property.
Infinitely more so, the same idea should
apply to oil. If there is one thing in which
the profits are so large that even an Austra-
lian Government couldn’t make a loss, it
is an oil-well, and the product is so
valuable and necessary, not only for naval
and military purposes, but in everyday com-
mercial and domestic life, that nothing could
be bad enough for any Government that
allowed such an asset to become the founda-
tion of an enormous monopoly like the Stan-
dard Oil of the TJ.S.A. If the oil proposition
of Papua turns out permanent and payable,
all democrats should keep a sharp eye on the
handling of the oil-producing territory.
Whether treated directly by the State or
leased to private companies, the interests
of the public should be stringently and care-
fully safeguarded. Only a fair profit on
capital invested should go to private in-
vestors, and the bulk of the profits to the
nation. Australia has long felt the want of
oil-wells, and when it gets them it should
take the best care that it is going to benefit
by them to the fullest degree, and not
allow them to become a medium whereby
its own people can be further ex-
ploited by outside capitalists, company
promoters, sharks and other money-
spinners. The same principles apply to
other descriptions of national assets, which
in the past have been passed out for a mere
mess of pottage. If we start with oil, re-
form may work in other directions.

Princess Royal co. has funked the job of
re-opening the illused Happy Jack mine at
Comet Vale (W.A.) on the ground that
“under present conditions it is impossible
to work it.” If, as the circular to share-
holders states, it is the water that prevents
an independent expert from sampling the
show, why didn’t the Board have its value
determined while the co. was in occupation
and the workings were dry? The fact is
that the co. would not spend money to drain
the mine: though it didn’t seem to mind
how much it put into plant. There 1 were
some good values in sight; but the market
was always considered first and last, and
the property never had a chance.

“8.C.”: Morwell is not the only brown-
coal pebble on the Gippsland beach. Lately
the Vic. Mines Department has been boring
to the north of Corner Inlet, not far from
Toora, and has found brown coal, running
up to 200 feet thick in places and with no
very great overburden, over an area of five
or six square miles. Rough estimates of
quantity rtin into nine figures. Just now
a test is being made on the off-lying Snake
Island. The channel leading past the island
into the inlet has plenty of water, and a
good port could be developed; so the field
may have a future.
If the returns for the past 1 eight months
are kept up the Commonwealth’s gold out-
put for 1918 will be about £5.466,000, or
£689,000 less than for 1917. The Victorian
gold crop promises to be worth £664,500 —
the very poorest since gold was first men-
tioned in 1851. It took the Gold State 22
years to drop below the £5,000,000-per-
annum level; 31 more years to get down
definitely below £3,000,000 per annum; five
more years brought it below £2,000.000; and
the next four years got it under £1,000,000.
Another 12 months at the present pace will
put it well under half a mllion. Outside
Westralia the best-advertised of the “bound-
less natural resources” approaches its coffin.
In fact it has probably got there so far as
aggregate profit is concerned. Gold-mining
is more of a habit than an industry now.

The Oversize of Palmer Tyres, and their unique
construction lessen shock from rough roads and
provide a remarkable ease in running. The
Palmer Patent Cords which are the basis of
Palmer Cord Tyres make them things of intense
vitality and resilience —are in fact the “nerves
of the tyres, ensuring absence of internal friction,
freedom from bursts, a saving of ten per cent, of
petrol, and far longer life on the road.
Palmer Cord Tyres are
made for Motor Cars
of all weights, Motor
Cycles and Aeroplanes.

The Light
in of ■■ ■
Australia
Brighter Homes.
In no sense can a Home be a Home
where the lighting is not all that it
should be.
Bright, cheery homes are a reflex of
a happy household. Where the light
shines bright and cheerful there may
be found the true conditions which
make for happiness and health.
No matter how far your home is
removed from the centre of popula-
tion the difficulties of lighting can
be overcome by the installation of
QUIRK S SAFETY
AIR GAS SYSTEM.
It gives the whitest artificial light
yet invented.
For country homes it is unsurpassed.
Not only is it the best reading light
possible, but in the drawing-room,
the billiard-room and the living-
room it will be found to be all that
can be desired.
In smaller country homes the com-
fort of the family is enhanced 100
per cent, by the installation of the
system, the running-cost of which is
inconsiderable and, once installed,
requires no technical knowledge to
maintain. During the hot summer
months the housewife will find
Quirk’s Air Gas System for cooking
and ironing a great boon, giving the
maximum of result with a minimum
of heat.
Some Striking Advantages
of Quirk’s Safety Air Gas System.
It is absolutely safe, non-explosive
and non-asphyxiating.
No gas is wasted.
It has no smell.
It requires practically no attention.
Insurance Companies demand no
extra premium when it is in-
stalled.
It can he adapted to existing acety-
lene installations.
’fhe cost of maintenance makes it
the cheapest form of artificial light
known.
The Installation.
Quirk’s Lighting'& Engineering Ltd.
maintain specially-trained staffs of
mechanics, who install the system
expeditiously and cheaply. The cost
of installation is moderate, the work
is done thoroughly, and once in-
stalled all lighting troubles are at an
end.
Do Not Hesitate
to make enquiries into the system.
The fullest investigation is courted.
Thousands of country homes, schools,
public institutions, etc., in all parts
of Australia have practically tested
the System, and in no case has it
been found to fall short of antici-
pations. A postcard to Quirk’s
Lighting & Engineering Ltd. will
bring to you an illustrated pamphlet
thoroughly explaining the System.
An estimate of the cost of installa-
tion will be supplied.

THE EMPTY CHURCH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A long-advertised and carefully-organised “Go to
Church Sunday” movement in Melbourne resulted in
so scant an attendance at the churches on the speci-
fied Sunday that the papers found it inadvisable to
say anything further about the matter.
One time, when fervent men believed,
The people went to pray;
Though beaten black, and oft bereaved,
And driven from the day,
They stole by night to caverns dark,
, By some starved preacher led,
Upon his back the felon’s mark,
The sword above his head.
And later in some cellar damp,
A watch beside the door,
The minister a hunted scamp,
They worshipped on the floor.
Not wall of rock, nor river deep,
Nor whip of hide or birch
Those early Christians could keep
From stealing to their church.
To-day the church all beauties crown,
Its seats are soft and fine,
The preacher wears a comely gown,
The choir is half-divine.
All high authorities to-day
The men to chapel call
Persistently, but, strange to say,
Men will not go at all!
One time by persecution stout
The people gaunt and thin
From church could not be driven out.
We cannot draw them in
With splendid show, or fluent creed,
Or finely-cushioned ease—
Not friends it is the churches need,
But powerful enemies.
VICTORIA.
EDDYSON.
“A.J.P.”: During a recent hop over by the
Americans a number of Fritzes were taken
prisoners. The Yanks started talking to one
of the caged, and tried to make the dull
squarehead understand that the Americans
were going to give them a hiding. Berlin
grunted: “But you can’t beat us, because
‘Gott Mit Tins.’” The Yank drawled: “Oh,
that’s all right; we’ve got the Australians
with us.”
“Murkah’s” experience:-
Re telegraphists’ “cramp.” In Great Britain recently
a- staff of 148 operators was medically examined after
a day’s brass-pounding. Eighty showed muscular
fatigue (the prelude to cramp) ; 15 suffered from
actual cramp ; 55 showed jjo sign of cramp. None
were mentally deranged. In my opinion, these
figures totally disprove the telegraphists' claim that
cramp is a mental, rather than a physical, ailment.
The position of the sending-key in Australian tele-
graph offices is the same as in Britain —right at
the edge of the table, and the operator is compelled
to support his arm in the air in an awkward posi-
tion for hours daily. That fact, and the high
speed maintained (the cause of 80 per cent, of the
errors), makes me wonder that the Australian break-
down figures aren’t worse than they are. Only the
wrist is used in transmitting, and why the arm
should be supported by muscular effort when it could
be resting on the table, is a mystery to me. In
Canada and the U.S. the key is placed about 15
inches inland, and the operator has an easy job.
Cramp is almost unknown there. Nearly every-
thing in Australian telegraphs has been imported
from America. Why this simple solution of the
cramp problem -isn’t likewise imported and fairly
tried out is something I can’t explain.
If it is true that the Czarina has been
executed by combustion—and it seems
probable enough—no female in history fell
more deeply into her own pit. She was a
German with innumerable German relations
and strong German sympathies. The alli-
ance with republican France and Portugal,
and . with . constitutional monarchies like
Serbia, Britain, Italy and Belgium didn’t
appeal to her. She was, in name at least,
the. centre of a movement by which the
Allies were to be abandoned and Russia
was to back out with its territory and its
autocracy intact, and the Kaiser’s eternal
gratitude. The army was starved of muni-
tions, and “bitter-enders” like Duke Nicho-
las were shifted to minor posts in order to
cool the war fury. But the movement got
out of hand.. Unexpected people took
charge of it and ran it on unexpected lines.
Instead of the devil who was raised for a
specific purpose obeying orders as a good
devil should do. he started business on his
own. And when he got going he had the
Devil’s own time.
The law (w’hich doesn’t exist yet but is
doubtless coming) against the adulteration
of facts, the wilful damage of education by
the dissemination of bosh, and the sowing
of the thistle of misconception in the human
pasture should take notice of Brookfield,
N. S. Wales. That wild and gyrating political
spectacle stated recently that only millionaires
get justice in this country. What he likes
to say about justice is his own affair, for
nobody can define the article to the satisfac-
tion. of everybody; but when he says that
millionaires get it or anything else he should
be made to prove that there are at least two
millionaires in Australia, or else be fined
£5O and costs. A millionaire, if he is fit
for his job, should manage to earn at least
6 per cent. —£60,000 a year. House prop-
erty is supposed to yield more than that.
The income-tax fiend has alleged that of the
total income (£240,163,204) which he could
find in Australia at the date of his analysis,
over 60 per cent, belonged to people with
less than £2OO a year each, and 72 per cent,
to people with less than £3OO. The richest
class (£5OOO and over) consisted of 832 per-
sons with an average of well below £lO,OOO
a year each. They possessed 3 per cent, of
the total income. There is room for very
few millionaires in that lot; in fact, it is
practically certain that the breed is dead.
They were always rather in the way of being
a superstition. Not one of the race has
died for a long, long time, and the
old men who aren’t dead don’t look
the part. Some of the most promising speci-
mens are simply picturesque and reticent
ancients with an annuity, a frock coat, a
mysterious habit of walking, and no relatives
to give them away. A publican at a micro-
scopic town about 60 miles from Sydney
was pointed out to the writer with awe in
the old bank-wreckage days as a “bloke who
had lent £150.000 to old Dibbs” and helped
a lot to save the country. His place wasn’t
much of a pub, either.

DON’T NEGLECT DYSPEPSIA.
A DANGEROUS POLICY LEADING TO
UNTOLD MISERY LATER ON.
Untold misery invariably results from
neglect of the early symptoms of indiges-
tion and dyspepsia, and there is always the
possibility that stomach ulceration or gastri-
tis may develop. That is why it is so
dangerous for those who experience pain
after eating, with a flushed face, heartburn,
etc., to wait and see if the symptoms will sub-
side of their own accord or become worse.
Be assured that they will certainly become
worse unless you take steps to neutralise the
acid, which is the root cause of the trouble.
To neutralise acid in the stomach, and so
prevent food fermentation and unpleasant-
ness after meals, is quite an easy matter.
Simply get some bisurated magnesia from the
chemist, and take half a teaspoonful in a
little water immediately after meals. This
Plan is surely preferable to dosing the
stomach with drugs or confining yourself to
an unattractive diet of easily digested foods.
It enables you to eat freely of the foods you
fancy, for by taking the bisurated magnesia
you keep the stomach quite free from acid
and prevent all possibility of food fermenta-
tion. Food remains bland and sweet until
perfectly digested, and consequently there is
no pain. This plan is recommended bv mam-
specialists. and is worthy of a thorough trial
by all: but to avoid confusion with the
acetates, citrates or oxides of magnesia,
readers should ask the chemist very dis-
tinctly lor the bisurated, the form prepared
especially for stomach use.—Advt.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
DAVID
JONES
for
SMART
MILLINERY
Sydney, September 89, 1918.
My Dear Arini, —
A big meeting of women was held in Her
Majesty’s Theatre (lent by the J.C.W.
firm for the momentous occasion) the other
afternoon to consider ways and means of
making Soldier Dependants’ Day a success.
Mothers, wives, sisters, aunts, and here and
there some young soldier’s granny, pledged
their last bonnet-pin to the good cause.
Mayor Joynton Smith exhorted the congrega-
tion to stick to its promises. The Lord
Mayor’s Fund, which was opened in 1914.
took over the care of helping the dependants
of men who, on hurrying to block the Hun’s
purpose, left their wives and kiddies in our
care. The fund has made up not only
the difference between the military pay and
a decent living for those at home, but it has
been a godsend in time of sickness. It has.
through its tireless executive, comforted the
widow, helped the orphan, and sent away to
health-resorts invalids whose breadwinners
were 12.000 miles across the seas. The cost
of working this fund has been only \ per
cent. Now the locker is empty. Maggie
Moore’s monologue. “Anzac,” was the his-
trionic sensation of the afternoon. It brought
out all the hankies to dab wet eyes. Oct. 11
is the date earmarked for the appeal.
After three years’ absence in khaki, Ser-
geant Lyster Ormsby. the genial Australian
well known in amateur athletic circles, is
home again. Being an outsize, worried
British authorities couldn’t even fit him with
a trench in France suitable to his figure, so
they kept him mostly busy as drill-instruc-
tor or doing odd jobs behind the lines, "where
the bursting shells make holes as big as a
museum. The Sydney man has bought a
share in the firm of Tyrrell’s, and will look
after the publishing department.
Mrs. Gwatkin, wife of the British Consul
recently at Yokohama, and since appointed
to Singapore, has been paying a visit to
Sydney. She caught last week’s boat for the
Malay States. She is an Australian by birth.
The naval concert, in aid of the Royal
Australian Cadets’Naval Band, in the Town
Hall, attracted a big audience during last
week. The William Cullens and Captain
Glossop were in the official circle. The young
sea-pups want cash to buy good instruments,
and, thanks to the organisers of the
concert, they are going to have their desires
fulfilled, Lieut. J. White was chairman of
the committee, and Warrant-officer Frolick
took on the job of business manager.
Justice Ilarvey. who is chairman of the
new Cranbrook School council, and liis col-
leagues, as hon. advisers, were in charge of
a party which gathered in the Rose Bay
academy the other afternoon. The accumu-
lated scientific mind present concentrated
itself on the laboratory, a just-completed
addition to the curriculum. The Cranbrook
boy with a kink that way can now splash
about in chemistry and physics to his heart’s
content in the old mansion that for a time
housed sub-regal State potentates.
Muriel Starr kept the news of her mar-
riage a fairly good secret last week (a few
friends had an idea there was something of
the kind in view), and quietly met W. IF.
Johnston in the bleak environment of the
Registrar-General's office without any fuss.
The ’groom makes trading concerns a hobby.
The Mission from France occupies this
week's social arena. A Journalists’ lunch
at Farmer's and a concert in the Town
Hall are amongst the items that the distin-
guished visitors will grace.
At the Limes, Twickenham. England,
Charles Lloyd Jones (of the Sydney firm of
David Jones, Ltd.) welcomed a new
daughter to the home nest on September 18.
The J. W. Kettlewell family is in the
throes of a great expectation. Joyce, a
young daughter of the house, has been
engaged for over four years to a S. Aus-
tralian Light Horseman,. Lieut. Cameron
Sharp. The tall Crusader, with Gallipoli as
part of liis war service, has been through
most of the fighting in Palestine. He was
going in for station life when the trouble
started, but that scheme was thrown aside in
1914. Now lie’s asking the authorities to
let the girl he left behind him journey to
Egypt and change her name to Sharp. The
young couple have a promise that some of
the “heads” are going “to see about it.” But
they’re not as swift as love’s young dream
would like.
Miss Soubeiran chose the dawn of this
week for her chat in St. James’s Hall. The
subject was the distribution of goods and
money from the French-Australian League
and the joy thereof in France. The busy
woman talks of going back there (she came
out via U.S. in the same craft with the Pau
group after a year’s absence) to see the
finish of the .good work.
One ' of the most successful of recent
garden fetes had the Cecil Pursers’ lovely
garden at Wahroonga as a setting on a
gorgeous blue-and-gold Spring day. Mrs.
George Fuller unlocked the festival. Pro-
ceeds go to the upkeep of the Edith Cavell
home. The bran dip was mobbed by the
infants present. Diana and Daphne David-
son were in charge. The Anderson Stuarts
journeyed from town for the party.
Will Ashton, who
was born in Eng-
land, was a toddler
of three years when
he first saw Adel-
aide—his home city
ever since. FI i s
father, James Ash-
ton, is a widely-
known artist, and bis
generous giving per
his brushwork to
war funds needs no
mention. The son
began to han d 1 e
colors with dad, and
then went to England,
and studied under
the famous Swede,
Julius Olss o n,
A.R.A., and Alger-
non Talmage. Thence to Paris, where the
young S; Australian imbibed French Art in
Julien’s Academy. After a trip home to
Adelaide he wandered off to Europe again in
1913, this time painting in Italy, France and
Holland. He returned to Australia in 1915.
But there was no rest for his restless person-
ality. He packed up his color-box almost
immediately, went to England and offered his
services for war work. He was rejected for
the firing-line (rheumatism was the obstacle) .
Then he drove a motor for the Y.M.C.A. in
London for awhile. Ashton returned again
in 1917. but he has made another offer for
his services. The National Gallery in Syd;
ney recently bought a fine sample of his
brushwork, and Adelaide and Perth Gal-
leries also own some of his handicraft. This
fine photo of him is by May Moore.
As a reward for keeping a. stout heart dur-
ing the long dark days of the war, brighter
news is persuading the Sydney girl to buy
herself a new hat and a frock or two for the
coming summer. The October races at Rand-
wick are a looked-for outing. So the great
army of girls who work for Billjim all the
year is shouting herself a frill or two to
adorn the racecourse lawns. This season’s
colors, in spite of war-time trouble with
dyers, are exquisite. Though prices soar the
smart girl who can make her own frocks will
turn out as well as ever she did.
For some time the .Voluntary Aid detach-
ments have been seething with arguments.
One lot. Lane Cove, downed brooms awhile
ago, after a splendid record of work
at the Woolwich Hospital. Behind the
upheaval is friction caused by the volun-
tary girls being brought more severely under
military discipline. This can be best
achieved, according to some of the . man-
darins, by paying those Aids whose work is
chiefly in military hospitals, and 18s. 6d. a
week is the sum named. The voluntary
movement threatens to collapse under the
new rules. The pride of the girls’ corps
was service for their country in the great
crisis of war without any payment. As a
protest against attempts to turn a labor of
love into a hired job, Mrs. Chris Bennett,
director of the V.A.D. in N. 8. Wales, re-
signed some weeks ago. And, what is more,
she won’t be camouflaged into giving any
reason but the real one, for retiring from a
responsible hon. position she has filled so
well. As a token of their affection, Volun-
tary Aids from city and suburbs rallied
round their late chieftainess at Rose Hall
the other afternoon. A handsome album
bulging with pictures of the V.A.D. was
handed to her by Gladys Owen on behalf of
the Pinny Brigade. Mrs. Wesche will take
the position of director, in place of the
gentle lady who steps down.
Harley Matthews, whose book of war
stories, “Saints and Soldiers,” is just out,
was a lawyer’s clerk when the row began.
But there was a poetic kink even in boyish
days. “Under the Open Sky” came from
his pen in 1916. Published in Sydney, it
was republished in England to catch a mar-
ket that wanted war verse. Matthews was
at the Landing, went on to France, was
invalided home with a wounded limb, and has
now settled down on the Inky Way in
Sydney.
There’s to be a fete in the Graytliwaite
grounds on Saturday. It circles round the
official opening of a new annexe to
soldiers. The usual stalls will deplete the'
visitors’ cash.
Brisbane notes: —
The French Mission was the big' event of the week.
Treasurer Theodore met the visitors at Murwillum-
bah and escorted them to South Brisbane, where the
Mayor and aldermen of South Brisbane gave an
official welcome. After a State dinner at Parliament
House there was a whirl of functions, including a
garden-party at Government House, a civic reception
and a party on the launch Lucinda. The Mission
then headed for Toowoomba en route to Roma, with
General Pau more than a little tired.
A Billjim just returned was in a Calais hospital
which was bombed four times in the same night.
Very expensive burrows had been made, so that the
staff could take shelter, but not one girl left the
wards. The Sister in charge of his ward gave all the
boys a cigarette and then lit one herself. No V.C.’s
were handed out for this. It was part of the day’s
job.
There is no prouder boy in Australia than little
Percy Hilliar, son of the teacher at Murwillumbah.
Percy owns a medal which he won at the age of
nine for rescuing another youngster from drowning.
General Pau saw the medal, made a few inquiries,
and then kissed the young Australian, who was
gazing at him with hero worship in liis eyes.
“Jingles that Jangle,” a book of political and
topical verse, by Jas. A. Philp, is now in the
press and will be published about mid-October.
South Sydney Hospital, the haven for sick
folk out Waterloo way. had a big linen tea-
party last week. William Cooper, one of
our few live baronets, gave the grounds on
which the big bungalow stands. The land
was part of the original estate acquired by
Daniel Cooper in the long ago.
The Peter Pan Club continues to pursue
the needful money for its cot in the Alex-
andra Hospital. On October 12 there’s to
be a Wendy party, where flowers may be
picked in the Never Never Land, and kiddies
may fish in the pond of pirate Captain Iloolc.
Miss Stockfield has handed over Alford
House, Darling Point-road, for the Peter
Pan outing.
The University fete to help the War Chest
was opened by Chief Justice Cullen. In the
glory of his Chancellor’s robes he was like
a big black-and-gold butterfly when the
breeze caught his fluttering garments and
the sun picked out the glittering gilt lines.
Two playtime policemen “arrested” him at
the end of his peroration. Presumably a
fine to the “Chest” set liis Honor free, for
he was certainly at large later in the day.
Gowned graduates in full sail under a stiff
westerly assisted at the stalls, where the
usual business, robbery, etc., was transacted.
The ’Varsity hasn’t had an outdoor raid of
this kind for two years, but, to make up for
its bashfulness, it. got in record returns on
last week’s effort. About £9OO was the total.
.T. R. McClean (president S.U.U.A.), J. A.
Schofield (hon. treas.) and lion. secs. Lilian
Wright, L Best and J. P. Shelton pulled hard
in the committee shafts.
Lionel Lindsay’s
appointment as a
trustee of the N. S.
Wales National Gal-
lery—he takes the
place of C. G. Wade,
now Agent-General
in London—has been
warmly welcomed in
art circles. He is a
member of the Soci-
ety of Artists, the
older R. A. Society
being already repre-
sented at the Board
by its president, Lis-
ter Lister. Lionel
Lindsay, whose writ-
ing on art in Aus-
tralia has given him
considerable prorai-
nence as a critic, got his training at Mel-
bourne under Bernard Hall. He is now one
of Sydney’s most versatile artists. His
etchings are in steady demand, and his
black-and-white work is scattered through
the pages of Australian publications. Com-
mercial work, a big side-line, takes up much
of his time. In his spare moments he grows
flowers and otherwise decorates Wah-
roonga. Tie is, of course, Norman’s big
brother, and he married one of the clever
Dyson family. In retaliation. Will Dvson
chose Lionel’s artistic sister Ruby, who'pos-
sesses all the charm of the Lindsay family.
The Gallery’s new trustee wandered over
Europe some years ago and made a special
trip to Spain, chiefly because he was infatu-
ated with “Carmen” and wanted to see the
tempestuous heroine’s native land. The
photo is. by Judith Fletcher.
A returned Billjim, chatting of France,
says _ the beauty of the country that a
ferocious enemy is being kicked out of
retains many of its pre-war character-
istics. “Australians are specially inter-
ested in some of the picturesojae and primitive
survivals of almost mediaeval customs
Dogs—a cross of some kind of hound—are
still used to churn the butter, for Instance.
By going round and round thev work the
simple mechanism of the great churn. Their
watch is four hours at a time. Then their
harness is taken off and they lie placidly near
their daily job.”
The new shop where returned wounded
soldiers’ handicrafts are for sale is at 40
Hunter-street. .Step inside, and the ladies
in Red Cross pinnies will find something
you’ll be glad to buy. Brave lads, struggling
through the long days of convalescence, make
the articles after being taught by experts.
Olive Kelso King, the Sydney girl who
is a chauffeur in the Servian army, has
asked for £lO,OOO for the good cause. About
half that amount is already in hand. The
smallest contributions at 118 Pitt-street will
be a godsend.
The skirt that is to go in double harness
with the new blouses is still agape witli
pockets on the hips. These bulging bag-like
receptacles are only intended for the clothes-
prop figure. When the lady who inserts her-
self inside these skirts weighs much more
than 7st. she makes a barrel-wise effect on
the streetscape.
Just out, “Little Songs for Little Folks.”
by the late 1 Josef Kretschmann. The
posthumous publication has been possible
through the devotion of the old music-
master’s former pupil, Esther Kahn. On
his death-bed the lover of children asked
that this little legacy should be completed
and arranged by his favorite pupil, and that
the proceeds of sales should be given to the
Alexandra Hospital for sick kiddies. W. H.
Paling and Co. are the publishers.
In the new Spring fashions observe the
polka dot —the old splodge of black, white or
color about the size of a shilling that used to
decorate grandma’s cotton morning frocks.
In thin silks the 1918 polka is an expensive
revival, for silk is considerably more than
twopence a yard. In a frock that “polks”
with a small straw hat the shape of a bun
and an all-round net or lace veil floating over
that, this season’s girl is getting back to the
mid-Victorian era.
The 4th and 56tli Battalion dames and
their pals, the Ist Machine-gun Comforts
Fund, invite your presence at a garden fete
on October 16, at the Albert Goulds’ big
garden, Eynesbur.v, Double Bay,
Waiting for passports to Egypt when an
impatient young soldier is the goal is weary
work, and one or two Sydney brides-to-be
just now are wondering how long it takes
Melbourne to cable to Cairo for instructions.
“About three months,” sighs one engaged
damsel, “more or less, and then the word
has to be dragged out of them with —well,
I’d like to try hot curling-irons !”
The old-fashioned Leghorn hat has come
back with a higher crown and stiffer brim
than of yore; but the 1918 headgear fashion
is of the accommodating kind, and you can
put. anything, in reason, on top and board
the tram with a serene feeling of being just
as up-to-date as other women, or a little
more so.
In the Repertory Theatre next Monday
evening (October 7) local society is assist-
ing at a complimentary show to Miss May
Summerbelle, musician and press writer.
A big house is a certainty.
On the very spot where ancient prophets
declared that the battle of Armageddon should
be fought the Australian Light Horse met
and smashed the Turks at the very moment
when the crisis of the world war was reached
and victory for the Hosts of Truth and
Right became certain. The valley between
Mount Carmel and Lower Galilee is the fate-
ful spot ; and the long straining of the eyes
of true believers in that direction is over.
What should follow? According to the inter-
preters of the prophets, the Saviour is now
due to appear on the Mount of Olives to
bring in the Thousand Years of Peace.
Yours affectionately.

The original “Fx & R” Watches are known through-
out. Australasia for their marvellous accuracy and
endurance.
But, as usual, we progress, and so now we are
showing the
SUPER “Fx & R“ WATCH.
Its present price is G3s. in steel-case, but what a
watch it is! Every latest improvement known to
horological science is in it.
It is jewelled in every part where wear occurs. It
will go with profound accuracy, indeed it is so accu-
rate that a ship could be steered to England by it.
For strength and standing up against hard wear
we unhesitatingly sav that no watch the world over

Melbourne, September 80. 1918.
M y Dear Y arrie, '
The Governor-General and Lady lieleh
will give a garden party, on October 12, to
meet General Fail and members of the
French Mission.
Sculptor James White, who died recently
in. Bananalaud while seeking for health, left
many sorrowing friends behind him, but no
bank account; so the James White Memorial
comes naturally into being, and Australian
art lovers, wherever they may happen to be,
are confidently looked to for the sake of the
sculptor’s widow and family. Sculpture is
la difficult art with few opportunities, and
White was further handicapped by uncertain
health- Also he had the modesty of the true
artist —and that doesn’t help a man’s cheque-
book in a world that is deafened with adver-
tising. Professor Anderson Stuart (Sydney
Uni.) and Professor Baldwin Spencer
(Melb. Uni.) are two patrons of the
Memorial) and the lion, treasurer is J. S.
Davie, Melbourne Technical School, 12(1
Latrobe-,street, Melbourne. For the informa-
tion of intending contributors it may be
mentioned that the fund will be properly
safeguarded and applied in the best interests
of the widow and children, the officers of
the Memorial acting as trustees for this pur-
pose.
Mrs. Mills, of St. Vincent’s Queen Carni-
val fame and wife of John, the Maffia sugar-
king, is looked up to by the boys at Lang-
war ron as a sort of fairy godmother. She is
given the credit of being the only woman in
the State who has taken a real live interest
in the camp. Included in a list of several
useful and highly-appreciated gifts from Mrs.
'Mills to the. men is a grand piano.
•On a recent Sunday the big-hearted woman
took two carloads of entertainers to the
camp, amongst whom were veteran-comedian
Will Whitburn, singer; Mrs. Leon Caron
and clever daughter Irma, who was the
star of the afternoon. The guests were after-
wards entertained by Major Cander, who is
responsible for the clean and cheerful aspect
of the camp. The interior of the concert-
hall is worth a visit. The side walls are
painted in panels of rose-sprays and flower-
garlands. and there is a huge representation,
of the landing at Gallipoli, extending from
wall to wall over the entrance. It has all
been done by the boys.
Melbourne horsewomen and most of the
country • girls are ■ conspicuously smart. But
one Showtime visitor was a startling ex-
ception as she rode along Alexandra-
avenue on a big chestnut. She wore, white
boots with tan leggings, a divided skirt, an
odd costume coat and a lace blouse open at
the neck. Topping all this was a three-
cornered hat with a white lace veil.
Poet and author Vance Palmer, who re-
cently left for the Front, has not been
allowed to put his pen aside. An alert O.C.
noted Vance’s readiness with the English
language, and immediately made him editor
of the ship’s paper. Vance has Private
Heitmann, M.H.R., as assistant.
Lieutenant Dudley Marwood Elliott went
west in France this month-at 22 after four
years’ service. He had just returned with
his stars fresh from an English university.
A water-colorist of much promise, he was a
cousin* of the Fosberrys, of Malvern, and a
nephew of the’ Geelong Marwoods.
Titian-haired, Grade Caulfield is now hos-
pital nursing in U.S., and in a fair way to
realise her ambition pi military nursing at
the Front.
The Dick Caseys have good reason to feel
proud of their younger boy, Dermot, who
got his Military Cross the other day. Lieut.
Dermot, barely 21, won the distinction by
‘‘conspicuous, gallantry and devotion to duty
on many occasions during the withdrawal
of the British forces before the last German
offensive.” He was a Melbourne Grammar
boy before he went to Eton and Cambridge
to be “finished.” From Cambridge he went
on to Woolwich arsenal for military train-
ing. His parents have been in England since
the early war days, but their hearts are in
Australia, especially at the principal racing
times. Dad Casey was chairman of the
V.Ii.C. prior to his departure.
The G.-G. went out to the Show on judg-
ing day, and was a dusty, enthusiastic Scot
long before he had tired of tramping round.
(The usual fashion note must come in here.)
He walked under a distinctive type of coun-
try hat—a putty-tinted bowler, specially
suited for cattle-parties. The Stanleys went
out next day and “opened” the Show. I
don’t know what they wore.
The Charlie Davis pair, of Hobart Mer-
cury, are here getting ready for the races.
Charlie has a string of horses to watch.
Mrs. Norman Brookes gave a smart
lunch-party at the Alexandra Club for
Principal Matron Murphy, of Bombay and
the Imperial Nursing Service. The guest
of honor was a dainty vision, grey shoes and
hose setting off her dove-grey uniform with
its scarlet cape. Our Matron-in-Chief, Major
Richardson, was there; also Matron Hill,
Matron Mills and Matron Goode. Mrs.
Pearce had her influenza-apologies tele-
phoned from her sick-room. Norman
Brookes met the Matron abroad during his
war work.
There was a rush of women to Federal
Parliament House on Wednesday afternoon,
when Treasurer Watt toiled through his Bud-
get speech. In the midst of the most com-
plicated figures one female was heard to re-
mark, “He’s going bald!” That is one thing
about us girls—-we can take an intelligent
interest in politics and hair-restorer simul-
taneously.
Mrs. and Miss Bowman, of the Apple Isle,
came over for Show Week and entertained a
host of their friends in the lounge at the

Military aviation is speeding-up. A lot of
new men are coming out from England, and
instead of four or five officers we are to have
14. Three of Major Harrison’s original staff
are being retained, or rather have returned,
to work after flying and fighting in France.
They are Captain McNamara, Y.C.; Lieu-
tenant Tunbridge, M.C.; and “Tubby”
Edwards. Tubby is a great favorite in the
very best flying circles.
Another Australian actor, Rupert Con-
rick. lias passed to the roll of honor.
Melbourne knew him as a gifted amateur;
but eight years ago he left for England,
where, with Benson’s Shakspearean co. lie
met with success in a long round of parts.
When the war alarm rung he joined King
Edward’s Light Horse. He finished with
the Tanks. Two brothers are on active ser-
vice, and a third, Lieutenant-Colonel Victor
Ccnrick, D. 5.0., has just returned.

Mrs. Adamson, who for 25 years has cared devotedly
for the crippled children and aged blind at Estcourt
House, has resigned her post as matron. For some
time she and her husband worked together there,
and at Mr. Adamson’s death she decided to carry
on alone. 111-health is responsible for her abdication.
At the W.C.T.U. convention the well-meaning
fussers emphasised the “evil of cigarette-smoking,”
decided that cigarettes were harmful to Billjim, and

Audrey Chirnside’s marriage in London
on July 25 was a very frocky affair. He is
Lieut.-Colonel Harold Pape, of the Tanks
Corps. She is the only daughter of the
George Chirnsides, of Point Cook and Wer-
ribee. Her mother has a genius for dress,
but Audrey loved tweeds and country boots.
Pape in civilian life is a horse-trainer, and
after the war he and Audrey propose to

A war romance came to the usual happy
conclusion at All Saints’, St. Ivilda, last
week, when Major Maepherson. returned
Anzac artilleryman, was made happy with
Ethel Maud Strickland, the capable and very
tactful ex-matron of an Australian hospital
ship. Many of her sisters-in-bandages and

Arnold E. V.
Richardson, a, young
South Australian
who is Superintend-
ent of Agriculture in
Victoria, has just
been to America,
where he was vastly
interested in the
science colleges for
women. Occasionally
he lectures at the Uni-
versity. There are a
number of petticoated
students in his biology
class, and he is en-
thusiastic about their
a ptitude. In every
State in America
there is at least one
large college devoted
exclusively to women students, especially in
domestic , Science. The scholars are taught
rural industries, scientifically and practically.
They also learn home nursing, and there
are cottages where each girl takes chhrge in
turn. The household is composed of. a batch
of students or a teacher’s family. There
are also general cooking classes, where each
learner has; her own stove. Food values
and food combinations are taught. Girls
with learned D.Sc. degrees get attractive
jobs in cities —if they are not first grabbed
by young farmers as life partners. The
Domestic Science girls are now working
hard demonstrating vegetable growing and
canning. Some of the big city parks have
been handed over to them. They also
demonstrate in public places the making of
“substitute cookies” for foods that are now
scarce. This photograph of Arnold Richard-

Alice, daughter of Colin McCulloch, came
down from N. S. Wales for Show Week.
She stayed at Scott’s and spent her waking

Sydney.
Jessie Masson, daughter of Prof. Masson,
gave her farewell piano recital on Monday
in the Assembly Hall. She is off to
America. Jessie, in her most immaculate
frock, played from Schumann and Brahms
before a crowd of admirers from the Univer-
sity. Fred Collier added his baritone to the
programme. He is going to Maoriland, and
the two may give another recital in Auck-

The Stanleys motored through the rain to
the Playhouse on Saturday night for the
amateur performance of “Trial by Jury.”
There was a packed house, and it sighed
disappointedly when Dr. O’Hara was an-
nounced to be out of the cast by reason of
’flu’. His Ex. leant wearily on the ledge of
his box. He had tramped the Showground
several times during a week of dusty north
winds. His dame wore black Spanish lace
fichued over her white dress, and a Carmen
red rose at her breast. DoriS Blackwood
was in another box with the Knights. Mrs.
Leslie Stuart had one gold-latticed pen, and
the stately Miller dame was visible in
another. Mrs. Blackwood appeared above
an enveloping fur coat in a third box, and
Mrs. Fred Fairbairn hostessed a penned
party.
I sat behind a well-known Federal
politician at ■ a vaudeville show the
other evening. A young person of ex-
cessive plumpness in the minimum limit in
the matter of skirt, and a dress body at
low-tide, was singing with the usual
serio-comic’s familiar bathos, the ever-to-be-
expected song about the'wicked and insincere
young “feller” of noble birth, the betrayed
maiden, and the dying mother, and presently
it was made apparent to all around that the
good little politician was weeping. He was
doing it rather noisily, but as I was in doubt
myself whether to cry or jump from a win-
dow, that did not seem unnatural in the cir-
cumstances ; but presently he turned to his
friend and sobbed : “G —d, that’s what gets
at the humanity in you ! That’s what tears
the heart out of a man !”
Yours siiicerely,
JOHANNA.

PROPERLY
The old-established Hawkesbury Club had
its annual overture to the A.J.C, Spring meeting on
Saturday. There was a time when the performances
on this club’s course were prolific in guides and
clues to what was likely to happen later. Perhaps
it was so last week; but the'fields were not expan-
sive. Sir'Paddington won the Rowley Mile with
7s.t. 61b. in “41.” It was time he got away with
something. But there was nothing in. the effort to
make his chances in the Kpsom, for which he was
backed a month or so ago to win a barrowful, look
any better than they were after the Rosehill and
Tatt.’s meetings. Selandra, who had seemed one of
the most likely outsiders in the Epsom, didn’t seem
that any more after the Rowley Mile, lie started at
6 to 4, moved off slowly and never gave the front
a trial. Laddie Blue, another Epsomite with some-
thing to recommend him, extinguished the recom-
mendation with emphasis.
The Guineas field was a bit below the stan-
dard for a race of its sort. There was Volpi.
Panacre’s sister Aranap, Carbern and three others.
On the strength of recent exhibitions it looked as
near _ a racecourse_ moral as anyone could expect.
\ olpi started at 5 to 4 “on,” and again let his
backers down. At the distance he seemed a certainty.
But Carbern kept galloping, and catching up on. the
leader 100 yards from the post beat him for the stake
by a few inches. The tvinner, a smart-looking
animal by Bernard from Carolga, showed more than
ordinary pace for a. two-year-old. He started twice
last month —at Moorefield and Rosehill —and on each
occasion finished unobtrusive’/ Volpi, who ran third
in last year’s Breeders’ Pl&„e at Randwick, and later
on gave Dunwill’s neck a stretching in the Easter
Handicap, has been a great friend to the books so
far. His record is nine starts, once first, four
seconds, a third, twice not placed, once left at the
post. On five of these occasions he was backed like
a certainty. Also he was solidly backed a few weeks
ago for the Epsom.
The Spring Handicap fell to Dick Meagher, a
Derby candidate, and in the early part of last year
one of the smartest two-year-olds in training around
Sydney. Richard carried w.f.a. (7st. 91b.). and at
tliis had a lot the worst of it in comparison with
Two Blues (7st. 131 b.) and the well-boomed Arch
Marella (Sst. 61b.). He stayed the distance well
and had Arch Marella properly settled at the end.
Tlie time “21J,” considering that the first three fur-
longs were taken slowly, is a long way from being
poor. Next to Woorawa’s win in the Rosehill
Guineas this win of Dick Meagher’s appeals to the
writer as being the best preliminary exhibition given
by any sprinter in the Derby. The objection to Dick
Meagher as a. Derby horse rests on the allegation
that he is not “class” enough. There is a lot of
assumption about this. He is certainly a better nag
than a few that , are reckoned to be the right sort of
class, and . this page has a suspicion that he may be
heard from with fair expectancy in the betting ring.
The A.J.C. Spring Meeting opens at Rand-
wiek on Saturday, and when it closes we’ll know all.
about the Derby, the Epsom and the Metrop., and
how Desert Gold behaved in the w.f.a. events, and
so on. There is a record lot of horses over from
ALL. to compete. On the other hand, there is the
smallest collection sent over from Vic. stables for a
long time. The Bananalanders are more optimistic
than the crowd beyond the Murray this year, and
they have entered more nags than are on the list
from the South.

Since his runaway win in the Chelmsford
Shakes with a featherweight aboard Gloaming has
been a. short-priced favorite for the Derby, and
appears certain to he the same on Saturday. The
C.S. performance was a breathless proceeding with-
out a doubt, and, added to the pritd’s subsequent
hurried efforts on the track, MeShortodds lias pretty'
sound reason for pursuing a policy of caution. Yet
the true bearing of the Chelmsford Stakes on the
Derby is hard to decide. Brilliantly though Gloam-!
ing galloped over the nine furlongs, it is still a
matter for speculation what Finmarlc or Almoner or
Outlook might have done in a race of that distance
with 6st. 101 b. The Chelmsford, with its queer scale
of penalties and allowances on w.f.a., has often been
a confusing race in its relation to later events. The
Derby is something very different, and looking for a
Derby trial this page is inclined to regard the win
in the Rosehill Guineas of AVoorawa with Sst. 51b. as
more illuminating than Gloaming’s revelation —to
this extent, at any rate, that it shows AVoorawa to be
up to Derby weight. Gloaming, carrying 231 b. less,
ran the distance in 2sec. better time.' With an extra
2Slb. on top and three furlongs further to go, will he
travel faster and stay longer than Woorawa? The
answer may be easy; but not to this writer. There
are other nags to be considered, too. Outlook, for
instance. This colt stood out on his own as an'
Autumn two-year-old. That he has a lot of pace now
ho showed in the w.f.a. Spring Stakes, a mile, at
Rosehill a fortnight ago by running second to
Panaere in a first-class field. Finmark’s showing at
Rosehill was well below Derby form, but the stable
insists on his ability to do much better. Almoner,
winner of last year’s Breeders’ Plate, is viewed by
his owner, Stead, with a fair measure of confidence.
Anyway, both these horses have improved during the
last couple of weeks. Then there is Dick Meagher
and others of whom more than one is a possibility.
It can be all boiled down to this, that this vear’s
Derby is a mighty open race, with nothing much
revealed to show the winner. Gloaming and Outlook
fire both Welkins. If there was any reasonable justi-
fication for suspecting them of staving the battle out
this page would look to one or the other. As it is,
if they fail Woorawa should be, not far away. His
pedigree will riot- stop him. any way. Ivillboy was
unplaced in the Chelmsford Stakes, won by Sasanof.
I hen he won the A.J.C. Derby. Biplane was un-
placed in , the same event last year. He next won
the Rosehill Guineas and the Derby. Prince Viridis
won the Chelmsford and was unplaced in the Derby.
Only once has the Guineas and Derby been won by
the .same horse. So you see the book throws more
gloom than light on the subject and heavily dis-
counts Woorawa.
The most noticeable thing about the Epsom
before the start was the slump which afflicted
most of the. earlier favorites. The expensive Malster
horse Amadis was the first animal seriously backed.
Since then he lias frequently run,' and on no occa-
sion showcd anything better than country-meeting
rapidity. Sir Paddington lias not done much better.
George Graves, had. his training interrupted. Louve-
tier has done no good. On paper none of these are
ill the picture. Late running points to Panacre,
Publican, Dame Acre and Norbury being somewhere
towards the front at the end. Panacre is a brilliant
tniler. He has a good horse’s weight in this ’race,
and good as he is the job of winning will trv him
right out. Much depends on a race of this kind on
the marble. Then some more depends on the start.
If these unknown factors could he seen in advance,
then all being well this page would expect to hear of
Panacre winning-. As they are not, and the Epsom
is a hard race to win, it lets the matter drop so far
as Panacre goes. The others named have unquestion-
ably good chances. A horse further down the list
which .may be found participating in the argument is
The Destroyer. He was doing well at seven furlongs
in the Chelmsford.
Most of the foregoing depends on whether Panacre
starts a fit horse. Early last week he was jumping
out of his skin. At the end of the week iio went
back in the betting, and there were circumstantial
yarns about trouble in the loosebox, and offers to bet
that he wouldn’t be a starter. A gallop on Saturday
gave no support to this. On Monday Panacre was led
about in the middle of the track. Owner Campbell
Wood stated that there was no justification for the
disquieting yarn about the nag, and that lie was as
well as ever. Meanwhile Publican went to the top
of the quotes and solid backing came, along for
Nor bury, Dame Acre and The Destroyer, and some
for the Bananalander Lordacre. On Mondav Ike was
ready enough to field against Panacre, but not
to take the liberties he yearned to pursue a day or
so earlier. On Tuesday the horse galloped a brilliant
seven furlongs, beating off a pair of two-year-olds
picked up at intervals and finishing in “80}.” • He
pulled up well.
Last year Kennaqultair was not in the Derby. Yet
he would be backed now to beat any, of the starters
in that event over tile same distance at w.f.a. And
with one exception (Biplane), he would almost cer-
tainly be the winner. This year he. is favorite for
the Metrop., and on the reckonings incidental to
paper calculations deserves to be. He has done well
since the weights appeared, well trained, and can
be relied on to stay. Assuming him to have reason-
ably good luck Kenmrqnhair looks about the hardest
thing any other animal in the race has to beat.
Should he be able to repeat his local expeditiousness
on this side of the Tasman the Maorilander Estland
may be closer up than he was at Rosehill recently.
A more likely source of anticipation is L'ingle. If
it be this horse’s day there are move unlikely things,
to happen than a Serious disputation between him
and Kennaquhair. By the way. a horse that is not
much noticed in the Metrop. is Court Jester. He
looks-very well.
One of the best gallops done at Rand wick
this season was .made by Wolaroi on Tuesday. He
stepped off the. seven-furlongs mark with Norbury
and Tresag, giving weight to both. Norbury ran in
front for three furlongs. Wolaroi then closed on
him and crossed the line a length ahead in “29}.”
Dan Seaton’s horse seems back to something like his
three-year-old form. If he stands up to it for
another week or two there will be some hurried pro-
ceedings. Another good gallop on Tuesday was by
Bursar and Destroyer; at Victoria Park. Bursar
had about 2st. the best of the weights. They ran
seven furlongs in “30}.” Both were heavily shod.
Desert Gold is, of course, -the star performer on the
Randwick tracks these days. She has fractured
nearly all the course records up to 10 furlongs. But
then she is an exceptionally free worker, and the
Maorilanders always work lightly ironed. Biplane
has not been so swift this year as last; but he has
done some mighty quick work all the same. The
other morning : he did a mile in the middle of the
course without apparent effort in “43 3-5.”
The Cocked Hat doesn’t go to races in
Sydney, nowadays, on account of the war, though
as his Majesty’s lieges go in vast numbers it doesn’t
seem to be much of a reason for toiling at home and
missing the fun. Staying away doesn’t seem to be
a very popular pastime with Governor Davidson.
Anyway, he got so worked up lately by reading about
the track gallops that the yearning to unofficially have
a look at a horse in action became unbearable. So
he arose at daybreak, hurried off to Randwick and,
perched on the top of a tote, watched the animals
at work with as much interest and pleasure as anyone
else. And as this was all very human and much
more reasonable than dodging the Epsom and Metrop.
for reasons that won’t stand looking at, the writer
gives his Ex. an anonymous cheer.
Jockey F. J. Foley is expected" back from
the Front with the first returning contingent of
Anzacs. He has had four years’ fighting in Egypt
and France. In 1912 he rode Cider when that prad
won the A.J.C. Derby, and he navigated Apple Pie
into third place in Comedy King’s Melbourne Cup.

“Bill R.”: They do things fairly strenu-
ously at some country race meetings. At Lomalong
on one occasion only one liorse -came out for one of
the events. He was sent on his lonesome journey
with an admonition not to be too long away. When
the flutter was over the committee disqualified liorse,
owner and jockey because a weight had gone astray
from one of the saddle-pockets between weighing out
and in. At Bibbenluke four steeds started for the
principal event on the picnic races’ programme. At
the finish the owner of each horse in the race pre-
tested against every other moke. The stewards had
much refreshment and straightened out the tangle.
They disqualified everything connected with the race.
Then everything blew up in the air. But a few men
lived to tell the tale.
“B.” : Racing in the N.T. is the limit. Cal-
cuttas are run on all races —for the' owners. The out-
sider who buys a horse usually buys a pup. Some
horses win by 100yds. and leave their weight on
the track. Others run with a stranglehold as if the
boy on top was riding at the Sydney ponies. The
rules are something like Gilruth’s ordinances. As
the tote is the legal means of betting, and seldom
returns better than 2 to _ 1 “on,” the usual sport
obliges and bets evens. Occasionally the starter gets
tlie field away together: but generally the picture
resembles Brown’s cows. Owing to the height of the
mulga no race can be seen till the last 100 yards. An
erstwhile Rosehill winner used to carry 14st., and
wait for the procession at the flush, but it was
reckoned not fair to train him. About the only
sport at the races worth watching is the crown, and
anchor game run by a few of Vestey’s rouseabouts on
the nigs. Otherwise the sport of kings thereabouts
is the sport of goats.
A. P. Wilson, who has been connected with
racing in Sydney for over 25 years, and has been
appointed Stipendiary Steward to the Calcutta Turf
Club (India)., was given a farewell last week by
about 30 representative turfmen. He emerged with
a fine stop-watch and accessories, the gifts of the
metropolitan and provincial registered racing clubs.
R. S. Holcombe, who put on khaki with
Sydney ’Varsity battalion the other day, was one of
N. S. Wales finest school athletes. He captained
G. P. v. ’Varsity at cricket; was captain of
S. C. E. Grammar at footßall and cricket; and runner-
up to young Ashton in the boxing championship.
Last year he won the G.P.S. 880yds. (2min. 4sec.)
and mile (4min. 43 2-ssec.) championships. Another
young giant in the join-up was T. M. Barnett, who
stroked Sydney Grammar to success in last year’s
eight-bar championship.
L. McStay had a busy day last week,
landing St. Ignatius (Sydney) senior championship.
His successes were in the 120yds. hurdles (17 4-6 see.)
and high jump (sft. 3in.), second in the shot putt
and mile, and third in the discus throw. Another
to do well at the meeting was F. Oxenham, who
gathered up the 220vds. (24sec.) and ran second
in 100yds. In the G.P.S. meeting recently, Oxenham
got a place in the 100yds., 220yds. and 440vds.
championships. Both McStay (No. 4) and Oxenham
(No. had a seat in the St. Igwitius boat in last
year's eight-oar G.P.S. championship. They are also
in the first flight of football and cricket.
* * * *
G. Massy (Southport) had some all-
round exercise in the Bananaland secondary school
championships at Brisbane last week. He broke the
tape first in the 100yds. (10 l-ssec. ; the best figures in
school championships in Australia this year), 220yds.
(24sec.), 120ydS. hurdles (18 I-s See.) ;.was second in
the 161 b. shot putt; and pushed a successful leg ill
the relay championship. Massy’s efforts were the main
factor in Southport (33 1-5 points) winning the
shield from Brisbane Grammar (23 points).
Most of East Sydney’s success over New-
town in the Australian . Rules football premiership on
Saturday, was derived from the hefty kicking forwards
Merrick and Jenkins. Of the 14 goals scored, Merrick
booted five and Jenkins four. East Sydney piled up
34 —7 in_ the final quarter and led by 96—43 when
the bellrang to pack up the season’s' baggage.
“'Leo Lear”; Before you hand out the
wattle-wreath for the best all-round athlete consider
the claims of I. A. S. Jackson, son of Dr. E. S.
Jackson, of Brisbane, who has just left the Geelong
Grammar for ■ the Front. He was winner of the
school cup in 1916 and,1917, in the latter year captur-
ing the 100yds., 220yds., 440yds., 880yds. and 120vds;
hurdles and arriving third in mile, weight and high
jump. He was in the school eleven in 1915-16-17-18
(captain the latter year), and av.eraged during,the
period 34 runs for 26 innings, and 49 wickets for
10.9. In the football team in 1916-17; captain
1917. Stroked the eight in 1917 (winners “head of
river” race) and in 1918. When you add to this
hatful the tennis championship of school 1915-16-17
the record will take some beating.
* # * *
The Cricket Association of S. Aus. has
decided that the game shall be revived in Adelaide,
which has been getting the name of having no
outdoor s£ort except racing and bowls. District
games are to be played this season by such scratch
teams as can lie raised, a permit committee seeing to
it that no military “eligible” shall take part if over
21. A feature of the annual meeting of the Associ-
ation was that Mostyn Evan had to. take the chair
m the absence of president Edwin Smith, who is now
88 and has to go slow. It was said that the latter
had been president for 27 years, and a vice-president
for the previous 20 (which goes back to the Associa-
tion s start), and that he had never previously missed
an annual meeting if he were in Australia.
Canterbury (M.L.) Cricket Association
found its venture of planting spuds in Lancaster
Park last season so profitable that the scheme gets
another trial during the coining year. The call-up
throughout the Dominion has left' the cricket pitch
very bare; and the Association is out after' revenue
from, murphies until war conditions change. F.
Wilding (father of tennis champion Anthony Wilding
killed in- France last year) will fill the presidential
chair during the vegetation period.
“M.P.A.” : When “Report” wrote his par.
from France to The Bulletin about the Hacken-
schmidt-Gotch affair in the boom days of a few years
back he was exuding through his hat in liis refer-
ence to the “less experienced” Gotch. As a matter
of fact Gotch was acknowledged by Farmer Burns,
Rollow and the bunch of eateh-as-catch-can profes-
sors in U.S.A. as a top-notch exponent of the
wrestling game quite apart from the tricks he'
specialised in. On tiie other hand, Hack, was never
a-clever eateh-as-catch-can man, and on this point I
can be borne out by every wrestler in Australia who
ever took hold with him or saw him on the mat. 1
was privileged to see the big fellow in all phases of
the game—in the training-room, on the exhibition
mat and in fair-dinkum goes—and I never saw him
do anything that would be considered clever by an
experienced cateh-as-catch-can performer. Hack, was
first and foremost a Graeco-Roman wrestler, and it
was in that style that he upset all the big guns on
the continent at Vienna when a young and fresh
man. He afterwards wrestled catch-as-catch-can
because it was the popular style in England, where
he made his fortune; but the powerful and speedy
Hackensehmidt downed Ills opponents by pure stren°-iii
and agility. It was his wonderful speed that did the
trick and not the limited knowledge he had of catch-
er! C + a * C Hi Can ' G"°tch affair, it was £2OOO
that pulled Hack, across the water against the advice'
of his old confidant, and manager, George Ivins Mor-
gan. Morgan knew that Hack, had a pair of doubt-
ful knees and a pair of elbows in very much the
same state. Gotch was scared of Hack., but—the
referee was squared, so it didn’t matter very much
if Hackey had bitten. Well, the latter" hadn't
a dog s chance, anyhow, because he was up against
a clever catph-as-cateh-can wrestler and the condi-
tions were all against him. This he was told before
he took it on. If the tricky Gotch or any other
lank grappler came the games they do in U.S. on
say, a Melbourne mat the mob who follow' the sport
thereabouts would up and do what they did to old
Singh at Wirths’ Circus years ago.
* #
There was a stirring-up of old events the
other day in a Sydney Court when a solicitor pro-
ceeded against, the Darcy estate for recovery of fees
amounting to £B2 10s. He got judgment, 'it trans-
pired that Les Darcy* had consulted the solicitor
about getting a passport for Americabut the
mam point was that the boxer had insisted upon
his willingness to return and enlist. “There is
£6OOO staring me in the face over yonder, 1 can
go and get it, come back and join the army. Mv
people, who have always been poor, will then lie
provided for properly, and it is my duty to' do this ”
There is this to be said, at any rate, that Darcy was
not the only man of his time who looked at the
dollars first; and there were few who did it with
the same good reason, and for whom more excuses
could be made on that particular point. The real
trouble with Darcy was that his head had been
turned hv stories of the wealth to be acquired in
U.S., and he became susceptible to influences of the
wrong sort. Had’ he waited and relied on counsel
from wiser sources than those which prevailed at
the end, the probabilities are that a conditional pass-
port would have been forthcoming, as in the case of
other people, and the “get away” would never have
been chronicled.
Harry J. : I was in hospital in Branco
last year when' one of our lads was taking the last
count. He’d always been a two-up “head” in the
battalion, and remained a sport to the last. He had
multiple wounds, and for about 110 hours lie hadn’t
spoken a word when, about four o’clock in the after-
noon, he raised himself to a sitting posture and wav-
ing his good .arm shouted out clear as a bell: “Ten
bob ’e ’eads ’em; ’eads 10 bob; ’cads 10 bob.” A
long pause. Then in a well-satisfied tone: : “There
you are.” He’d won the bet, and I reckon that the
Great Ringkeeper would see’to it that he got a lair
deal.
“H.J. J.” : Before going to Gallipoli 1 could
hardly credit some of the yarns I’d heard abbut Un-
boys talking sport while all sorts of ironmonger! -
tanged and buzzed about them ; hut I soon bcieame
convinced. Ate were going hell-for-leather from Rest
Gully to Hill GO in the early morning of August 22,
1915. Before we’d got to the attacking point the
day was breaking, and while we’d sat down for a
breather on account, of some delay in front, Jack the
Turk had located us. Although the light was not
yet srood enough for him to actually see us, still some
of his chance shots were striking home. Xearlv
everyone was pretty silent, for we were neirly all
green to the. business, and the occasional shrapriel
that came screeching overhead and burst jwilh a
vicious-looking fled splash was just cldse enough to
make us interested. I could distinctly catch 'the
thread of an argument that emanated from a small
group on my right whose faces I couldn’t distinguish
in the half-light. It was a wrangle as to the namo
of a prad that had won the Melbourne Cup a good;
way back. I. could recognise my pal Mac’s voice l
denying the veracity of someone’s statement in good
Australian oratory. Suddenly he rose to his feet and
was just in the act of putting up 50 piastres to
clinch a wager when we got the order to move on.-;
But Mac didn’t. come with us.
“Irala": If apy reader is looking: for n
waterproofing for fishing-lines for sea fishing here it
is: Take erne pint of Stockholm tar and 111 k bees-
wax. Boil together over a fire for lOmin. I got it
from an amateur fisherman who swears that: it will
waterproof anything for ever.
#■ * * *
“Jacko”: What the homer will battle
through to get back to his loft was well illustrated
the other day, when the Bathurst' Pigeon Society con-
ducted a fly from Girilambone. The air-distance is
216 miles. Heavy rain was encountered all along,
and the poultry had to be wrung out when they
arrived. Nevertheless the distance was covered in.
a' few minutes over six hours. J. Ingersole’s bird got
the crumb, with an average of 1039yds. lOin. per
minute. . ;


With Health Everything is a Source of Pleasure
—without it, nothing else, whatever it may be, is enjoyable.
Even the other personal blessings—a great mind, a happj
temperament-—are degraded and dwarfed for want of )t.
Everything should be made secondary to health.
There’s no reason why you should not be healthy Nature
intended you to be so.
The various organs of your body have certain functions to
perform. It is your duty to see that these organs are not
overtaxed or run down, which will prevent them from
properly fulfilling their respective functions. For instance,
constipation, indigestion and other disorders of the system
are the direct result of your internal muscles being much
below normal —failing in their duty.
My exercises pay particular attention to the muscles that
govern the action of the stomach, liver and bowels, and
quickly bring them back to a healthy state again.
Surely you want to enjoy the best, of health? Then wh>
not write to-day for full particulars of my
POSTAL COURSE OF HEALTH AND STRENGTH CULTURE?
This is proof of what I say:—
Dear Sir, —I am writing to you to let you know how
I am getting on after a month’s course of you*
Physical Culture. lam feeling splendid, and must say
I am very pleased with the result of the exercises,
have gained 10lb. in weight, and am feeling realD
well. (Signed) P.D.R., Dookie , (Victoria).
Many hundreds of letters from pupils all over Australia
and New Zealand are in the same strain.
I should like you to have my booklet, “HEALTH AXI'
STRENGTH FROM SELF-CULTURE,” which tells about my
methods, fees, etc. Just write your name and address .across
this advertisement, and send it to me with three penny
stamps for postage.

“Wonga" : The wheat cookies have battled
strenuously for two or three years to obtain
farmers’ reps, on the Central Wheat Board
—not altogether a startling request, seeing
they own the wheat. After much strategy
they got one representative on the Board (he
has since been practically extinguished by
the Censor), but now Acting-Prime Minister
Watt has agreed that each State shall have
one cocky representative on the Board. At
time of writing there were indications that
this would be violently objected to by sundry
small State Ministers, who now make up
most of the Board and who were not con-
sulted regarding this new move. At the
same time some of the cookies are failing to
display undue excitement over the granting
of their request, as there is a feeling that
the wheat-pools have got into a wild and
glorious mess, and they suspect that there is
a scheme hanging round to let them
in at this late stage and then shoulder
the blame on to the cocky. Anyhow, if it is
a square deal it is an extraordinary instance
of pigheaded contrariness that the Federal
Government did not do the fair thing long
ago. It would have stopped a lot of growls
and dissatisfaction among growers, even if it
did not do any more, while so far the treat-
ment of the wheat-cockies has been in glaring
contrast with that of the woolgrowers and
dairy cockies as regards having a say in the
handling of their product—and both wool- and
cow-men have been pleased with things gen-
erally.


STOPAIN
A BOON TO MOTHERS.
After much thought and experiment
we have at last succeeded in completing
what we believe is the most successful
treatment known for toothache. Vv £
have placed it on the market under the
name of
STOPAIN
A Toothache Gum.
Besides being the latest and most
successful treatment for toothache,
Stopain is both simple and economical,
It is in the form of a gum and all you
have to do is to fill the cavity of the
tooth with it. It excludes the air and
stops toothache immediately.
No more burnt gums or blistered
tongues by liquid "cures” and this
alone means a lot to mothers.
Not only does Stopain relieve the pain,
but it also assists to preserve the tooth
until dental aid can be obtained, thus
making it invaluable to families in the
country who are often a day’s journey
from the nearest dentist,
Stopain is a boon to mothers. No
home should be without Stopain ; it is so
convenient and never fails to bring relief.
Stopain has been tried by thousands of
people and we have never yet known it
to fail when used according to directions.
Get it now for you never know when it
may be needed.
Stopain is sold by most retailers at Is.
per box, but if yours hasn't got it in
stock it will be sent, to any address
postage paid, upon receipt of price by
SUNSET DRUG CO.,

Influenza.
It is at this time of the year, when the
weather is very changeable, hot one day and
cold the next, that colds are caught and
influenza becomes prevalent.
Influenza invariably leaves the patient
weak and with thin blood, and this ansemia
is very stubborn in resisting treatment. It
must "be corrected, however, before any cure
can be considered permanent. As long as
the blood remains thin there will continue
the relapses with which most sufferers from
influenza are familiar. Warmth and quiet
alone give comfort, and these not for long a'
a time. Sleep is restless and does not re-
fresh the nerves, which are always at high
tension.
The best way to correct this after-effect
of influenza is to build up the blood, and
there is no better blood-builder than Dr.
Williams’ Pink Pills.
As soon as the revitalised blood courses
through the system you are aware of its
soothing influence. Gradually the color
returns to the pale cheeks, appetite and
digestion improve, and you are on the road
to health.
There has been no increase in the price
of Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills. 2s. 9d. per box.
six boxes 15s. 3d. at your chemist or direct
from the Dr. Williams’ Medicine Co., Box
594 G.P.0., Sydney. The pamphlet. “Dis-
eases of the Blood.” is free on request.

Never force children
to take ill-tasting medicines.
START when they are babies and give them
Chamberlain’s Cough Remedy at the first
symptom of a cough or cold.
There will be no forcing them to take it—they
will ask for it for the kiddies just love Chamberlains
Cough Remedy.
There are parents who to-day give this medicine
to their children because they remember how eagerly
they themselves took it when they were kiddies.
But this is not the only reason.
ChAMBERLAIM
( COPYR.IG'-TE.DJ
They know from experience that for the treat-
ment of coughs and colds, croup and whooping
cough, nothing equals Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy.
It contains no narcotics and every mother should
be sure on this point about the medicine she
gives her child. Too much prominence cannot
be given to the danger of giving children
medicines containing'opium or other narcotics
for many a little one has been permanently
affected by medicines of this description.

Looks like leather but is better in every way. It wears better
and never becomes shabby, as being impervious to atmos-
pheric action it never peels or cracks. It is stain and grease
proof, and can be made like new by simply washing with soap
and water. A Rexine-covered suite has all the beauty or
leather upholstering without any of its disadvantages, and its
cost is only one quarter that of leather.
Do away with unhygienic, dust-collecting Lbric upholsterings

Every movement of the
body uses up a definite
amount of vitality. That
is why you feel tired at
the end of the day. When
you overtax yourself, or
when your vitality is
undermined by illness,
ydur whole system be-
comes too exhausted to
recover its lost vitality
without assistance. Your
system is like a plant that
is drooping for want of
water. And just as water
revives a drooping plant—
so ‘Wincarnis’ gives new
life and new vitality to a
weakened constitution.
Because ‘Wincarnis ’ pos-
sesses a four-fold power.

The Wine of Life
creates new strength, new
blood, new nerve force,
and new vitality. The
benefit begins from the

can feel it doing you
good. You can feel every

more strength than you
had before, and surcharg-

Janies, Minister for Public Instruction in
N. S. Wales, had good cause to congratulate
the boys of the State Schools at Goulburn
the other day. The pupils have erected two
cottages for returned Billjims. The first
home, built by boys from the High School,
was begun in October, 1916, and opened in
June. 1917. The builders averaged about
years of age. The construction of the second
and larger home was undertaken by boys from
the four primary schools, their ages averag-
ing a little over 13 years. The two houses
cost nearly £lOOO. which was raised almost
wholly by pupils' efforts. The building site,
right on the banks of the lovely Wollondilly,
was given by Miss Monkley. who offers
another block, adjacent to this, if builders
for a third home are forthcoming.
“H.1.G.” : The Vic. Education Department
needs waking up to the fact that, its facilita-
tion of juvenile insolvency isn't the best sort
of training for children whose chief inheri-
tance will bo a mountain of debt. At the
State School, in my suburb, Friday after-
noon is devoted to school concerts in aid
of patriotic funds. Youngsters who can beg
or ' borrow a penny—or will give their
teachers an 10 U for one —gain admittance.
Those who can't or won't are kept at les-
sons. In addition, a stall run by one or
other of the classes is open throughout the
week, and by its alluring display of pies and
other •‘bargains’’ leads to the chronic bank-
ruptcy of many money-boxes. The eat-drink-
and-be-merry enthusiasts who sustain the
financial crises of our juvenile population
claim that - this orgy of spending inculcates
a spirit of patriotism. Seems to me that it
would be better to tackle the really patriotic
job of discouraging the Australian kid from
the old man's habit of spending his last bean
and borrowing to keep going.
‘'Cleveland”: Some of our Australian
wood wasters and importers should visit
Tunisia to learn a bit about forest conserva-
tion. Every endeavor is being made to
encourage the planting of trees. The French,
since their occupation, have planted rows of
Australian eucaiypts all along their railway
lines, so that sleepers are growing on the
job ready to replace decayed ones. At rail-
way -stations they have wattle and pepper-
trees, while the main streets of Tunis are
lined with weeping-tigs and purple jaca-
randa. I struck this hamlet a while ago, and
thought I was back home in Australia again,
as every tree was an old friend that had
messages from the wide open spaces of the
finest country in the world. The most home-
like thing was that, with the exception of
the weeping-tig, all the others had retained
their Australian names, and when I told
one of the heads of the town that in Aus-
tralia we have red jacaranda, he said
“Bon !” like a cork coming out of a demi-

“This”: The remains of the schooner
Thistle, in which the Hentys went to settle
at Portland (Vic.) in 1834 are still visible
at times on the beach near Port Fairy (Vic.).
Like a number of other smart sailing vessels
of those days the Thistle was built at Laun-
ceston (Ta's.), by John Griffiths, a N. S.
Wales native, born in the same year (1801)
as John Batman.
From the Gallery :
Jim Page lias returned to Ids seat in the Reps,
without the old suggestion of a lazy giant. He has
been much chastened by sickness. Always a patriot
whose adoption of a uniform has only accentu-
ated the military spirit within him, he has recently
found it difficult to conceal the derision with which
he views the peace-by-negotiation party. At present
he seems bursting with suppressed explanations, so
if there be a sudden roar like a blowout on a liner,
you will know that James has at last uncorked his
reticence and is mentioning his repudiation of his
pacifist pals. There is a lot of indignation in that
portly frame, and when it eventually gets an outlet
the friends of the Hun will feel as if they were
being walloped by a swinging elephant ballasted with
concrete.
“Report” : The wisest cat I ever met was
the mother of five who shared our billet in a
badly-battered French village. Every morn-
ing puss would come and sit at the door.
After a few moments’ deep study she would
go in and bring her family out into the
yard for a little airing. Fritz was in the
habit of dropping a salvo or two during the
day, and on the first sound of a shell coming
our way puss would grab No. 1 kitten and
streak for cover. She lost no time doing
the five trips. We came to the conclusion
that when she was sitting at the door she
was taking mental notes of enemy artillery
fire and her judgment wasn’t bad. There
were no casualties to report up to the time
of our marching out.
“Parisine” : General Pau was educated at
St. Cyr Military Academy, like his grand-
father, father and son. He was three
times wounded on the day of the
Battle of Woertli, August 6, 1870;
lost his right hand and was made pris-
oner. His elder sister interviewed Bismarck
and obtained his release. Pau, then, did not
appear good for anything, being unable even
to walk. Yet he was in the campaign again,
under severe conditions, with the French
army. The work almost killed him, yet it
was only the prelude to over 20 years of
intense activity in organisation. There are
some stalwarts that you can’t kill unless you
explain to them the Commonwealth’s fiscal
policy. Then they fall down dead before you
can hit them.
“S.”: Victor Daley used to tell of an
old-time Melbourne writer who knocked
the poet up late one night and pleaded
for a shake-down. The applicant was
in a pitiable state of whisky. The
house Daley then lived in had formerly been
a dairy, and there was a curious little stone
building that had been used as a cooling-
room. The caller was assisted into this and
given a hastily-devised bunk. He slept
late, and eventually Daley went to call his
guest. The good-soul sat up on the floor,
blinked at the four stone walls, and said:
“Great Scott, warder! How many days?”
Ulric Berwick Walsh, attached lately to
a Military Cross for good work near Morlan-
eourt in the great Hun attack last May, was
a clerk in the petty sessions office at Narran-
dera (N.S.W.), when he enlisted two years
ago as private in the A.I.F. Stripes came
before he left Australia, and a lieutenant’s
star followed in France last year. Age, 24

A Natural Remedy
Time was when disease was thought to be due to the
direct influence of evil spirits, and exorcism and magic
were invoked to cast it out.
Science has taught us wisdom. The evil spirits exist
still. We call them “Disease Germs,” and they also
must be cast out. Once lodged in the stomach or
intestines, fever with its hallucinations, or biliousness with
its aches and pains, is the result.
ENO S FRUIT SALT’
is the approved remedy for driving out disease germs.
Its action is quick and thorough. It clears the intestines,
rouses the torpid liver to new life, stimulates the mucous
membrane to a healthy action, and cleanses and invigorates
the whole digestive tract.
Be prepared, for , emergencies by always keeping a
bottle in the house. 1

Miss Winnie Tate Praises
Dr. Sheldon’s Magnetic

Miss WINNIE TATE, one of the
prettiest as well as one of the
most graceful of the J. C.
Williamson Ltd. dancers, has been
greatly admired in the recent
revivals at Her Majesty’s, Syd-
ney. This charming dancer is
enthusiastic in her praise of
Magnetic Liniment. She says:—
“I have been using your Dr.
Sheldon’s Magnetic Liniment
now for over two years, and
I am sure I could never per-
form my work without the
help of Magnetic Liniment. A
rub with Magnetic Liniment
after strenuous dancing makes
all the difference in the world,
for it takes away the tiredness
and strain, and leaves me
quite as fresh as ever.
"You cannot imagine what
a lot of uses I find for Mag-
netic Liniment. I have used
it for Toothache, Headache,
.Neuralgia and for a rub-
down after swimming, and in
every instance it has proved
most effective. I can assure
you that Magnetic Liniment
will always have a place on
my Dressing Table or in my
Travelling Bag, and I never
lose an opportunity of recom-
mending it to my friends.
"Gratefully yours,

A Ballad of Kings.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I LIFTED my hand to Fergus, king,
And he lifted his hand to me,
As he passed me by in the front of
Spring,
With bloom on the apple-tree.
On a high, white horse he'went his way,
And I went well afoot;
Good luck to the saddle he rode that day,
Good luck to my freeman’s boot!
I had twelve arms-length of the cloth to sell,
He had six broad lands to rule ;
And we whistled one tune, for it was well
To weave the laws or the wool.
lie had a place and I had a place
With a good thatch roof above;
And both went out with a shining face
With a kiss on the mouth of love.
Fifty harpers had Fergus, king,
To sing above the wine ;
But I hid a flute with a voice of Spring
That made a song of mine.
The High King’s doors'were open wide
That all might enter there;
But what poor man would be denied
My own white meal to share?
Fergus, king, had an oak-tree laid
For lire to burn at night;
But I had good bog-turf that made
A flame that 1 poked as bright.
A brave word had the king to say,
A kind word still had I;
’Twas well to meet him on the way
Below the young Spring sky.
I lifted my hand to Fergus, king,
And that was right and well;
For he lifted a hand with a broad, gold ring
The greeting word to tell.
And he was a man and I was a man ;
And this word to me was plain,
Since ever the good, green world began
One man had a head to reign.
But that was fifty lives ago
Since Fergus rode this way ;
And Spring has an apple-bloom to show
And a young, fine wind to play.
I will lift my hand to greet the king,
Wherever a king may be ;
For the good years still have a song to sing
In a heart that is beating fre.i.
They call the kings by another name
That walk the broad fields now;
But the royal look of a man’s the same
Behind a pen or a plough.
I am a man and he is a man :
And this word to me is plain,
Since ever the good, green world began
One man has a heart to reign.

Putting the Acid On.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“'ll iJT URGLE stole them cabbages right
IVI en ° •”
Sergeant Byrne swung round in
his chair in the hot little police-station and
fired the words at the bent back of Con-
stable O’Toole, at that moment, heavily in-
volved with Cattletown's criminal statistics
for the past year.
The Sergeant’s remark had broken a
silence that had endured for half an hour.
But Constable O’Toole showed no surprise
as he pivoted on his high stool. The minds
of both men had been full of Murgle and his
ill-gotten cabbages ever since Hoolan, auto-
crat of the Railway Hotel and president of
the shire, had practically called them a pair
of useless fools for being unable to catch
the known x’aider of his vegetable garden.
“Nothin’ surer!” sighed O’Toole, and
thoughtfully tapped his teeth with the pen-
handle.
“We’ve got to get Murgle,” said the ser-
geant gloomily. “If we don’t, Hoolan will
put our pots on. He’s a venomous swine is
Hoolan!”
“Watchin’s no good,” interposed O’Toole
hastily. “Every time I waited for him he
stayed away.”
“I tell you how we might get him,” said
the sergeant. “We’ll get him here and tell
him one. of the boys has put him away, and
that he’ll save himself trouble by owning up.
We’ll put the acid on him, and get him
guessing. If we keep at him long enough
and frighten him a bit, he’ll get scared, and
then it’ll be all over. I see it done in a
Yankee play up in Sydney last year, and it
beat a cleverer man than Murgle. You go up
to Farrelly’s pub now and tell him I want to
see him here, urgent.”
O’Toole caught up his forage-cap and
swung out into the sunlight. The sergeant
looked thoughtfully at Iloolan’s desecrated
cabbage-patch as if seeking inspiration there.
It wasn’t long before two shadows fell
athwart the threshold and in came O’Toole
and his unsuspecting prey—a fresh-faced,
cheery country lad, who didn’t seem at all
abashed or nervous.
“Goo’-day, Sergeant.” He nodded familiarly
at the officer in charge, who was by this
time trying to look very busy at his desk.
“Good-day, Murgle,” muttered the acid ex-
pert, purposely delaying looking up, the idea
being to disconcert the suspected person as
much as possible.
The sergeant’s hard-driven pen scratched
rapidly in the hot silence. O'Toole sighed
gently and put his cap down on the desk.
The clock ticked solemnly....
"Bonzer weather, ain’t it?”
The sergeant looked up with a frown.
Yes, it is!”
Then there was another oppressive wait.
, Er what was it you wanted ter see me
about, Sergeant?”
The sergeant carefully blotted what he
had written and tried hard to. conceal Ins
delight. The system was beginning to wort.
“About cabbages, me boy!” He looked
straight at his adversary and spoke m a hard,
dry official voice.
Constable O'Toole coughed like an under-
taker and waited.
Murgle didn’t fall into the expected panic ;
instead, he drew up a chair to the desk and
sat down. “Why, are you goin' to put some
in?”
“No, I’m not! I’m goin’ to see about some
that’s been taken out!”
“Yes?”
“Yes. me lad ! Taken out of Mr. Hoolan’s
vegetable garden!”
“Oh, them !” . ‘
“Oh. so you know somethin - ., rt oout them?
The sergeant leant forward in his chair
looking grey and relentless —at least, lie
hoped he did.
Murgle yawned very naturally. Yes, ot
course. They’re all pokin’ fun at Iloolan
over his cabbages.”
The sergeant tapped his desk impressively.
“Look here, Murgle, I know something about
those cabbages!”
The suspect’s eyebrows went up. ‘Go on !
What is it?”
“I have it on good authority that you ve
been taking those cabbages!”
“Look here, Sergeant, don’t you let them
lads pull your leg! They’ve been pullin’
Hoolan’s ail this week!”
“I’m not joking. Murgle ! I’ve been told, on
good authority, that you took those cab-
bages ! I know all about it, so you’d better
give us your version of it!”
“Go on now! Do you really know all
about it?”
“Yes, I do!”
“Well, you might tell us—l ’aven’t eard
tli’ joke!”
“You admit it. then?”
“Admit nothing!' sneered the suspect.
“W’y, I never knoo 11 oolan was growin’ cab-
bages till I ’eard he was kickin’ up a row
about havin’ them pinched !”
“That yarn won’t do here,” growled the
sergeant. “I tell you we know all about it!”
“Yairs, yens Johns know all about every-
thing—l don't think !”
“Don’t you talk like that here!” said
O'Toole firing up.
Murgle seemed mildly surprised and hurt.
“Why. Jim. ain’t I ’ere as a visitor? I
don’ re-member you arrestin’ me!”
O’Toole reddened. “Well, you oughter
know better than to talk like that to the
sergeant!”
Murgle laughed easily. “Oh, th’ sergeant
can take a joke, Jim! Don’t you worry
about the sergeant—he’s a sport. Ain’t you,
Sergeant?”
The sergeant cleared his throat. “It’ll
make things easier for you, Murgle, if you
own up!”
“Own up to what?”
“You know !”
“Blowed if I do !”
O’Toole wheeled on him. “Yes, you do !” he
roared, hitting the desk with his clenched fist.
Murgle’s quick retort was made in a level,
cheerful voice. “Bet you a quid I don’t!”
The sergeant took up the running. “We’ve
got the whole story, and we know you did it.”
“Well,” said Murgle, looking from one to
the other, “if you know, what are you
makin’ all this fuss about?”
Deep, bewildered silence.
Murgle spoke first—and he wasn’t at all
nervous. “Well, after this, I begin to think
ole Hoolan’s right in what he says !”
The sergeant and O’Toole couldn't help
fidgeting.
“Ah,” said the sergeant in a voice which
was intended to express his complete in-
difference, but only betrayed his intense
anxiety. “An’ what does Iloolan say about
me?"
Murgle inspected his boots.
“Did he say anything about me?” asked
O’Toole, sticking out his lower jaw.
“Yes, Jim, he did ! He was pretty rough
on you !”
“Oh, was he? I’d like to know what he's
got to say against me !. . . .What is it?”
“Yes, what is it?” echoed the sergeant.
“You won't tell him I told you?” asked
Murgle, looking frpm one to the other. “Well,
you know that larst night Hoolan got you to
watch his dam’ cabbages?”
“Yes, yes!”
“Well, he says that you didn’t watch the
cabbages at all! He says—Hoolan does —
that you went down to Mrs. Ryan’s and sat
there all night drinkin’ beer with her while
Ryan was on night-shift!’’ ?
O’Toole struck the desk a dreadful blow
with his clenched fist. “If Hoolan says that
he’s a dirty liar, an’ I'll tell him so to his
face!”
“Where was you, Jim —between our-
selves?”
“Dammit. I was watchin’ his cabbages!
Where else would I be?”
“Can you prove it, though? Hoolan won’t
believe you unless you can prove it!”
There were almost tears in O’Toole’s voice
when he found an answer to that. “How’n
Hell can I prove that? D’ye think all the
people in the town came down to see me
when I was sittin’ in a tree?”
“What tree, Jim?”
“What d’you want to know for?” shouted
the galvanised sergeant.
“Oh, jus’ because I happen to know some
cabbages was taken that night!”
“How do you know?”
“How ! Why, didn’t I get it from young
Jimmy Hoolan. That’s what made his old
man so wild. That’s when he started about
you bein’ down at Mrs. Ryan’s.”
O’Toole hit the table and turned to the
sergeant for consolation. “If I could only
get hold of somebody that had seen me that
night, I’d go straight to Hoolan and throw
the dirty lie back in his teeth!”
“P’raps the chap that took the cabbages
saw you !” insinuated Murgle slily.
“I bet he did!” sneered the sergeant.
“Yes,” shouted O’Toole ferociously, “and
if I’d seen th’ dirty, thievin’ hound”
“Yes, but that’s just what you didn’t see !
And now Hoolan’s as mad as a snake and
has us both snouted.” Sergeant Byrne tilted
his chair back and looked keenly at his sub-
ordinate. “Are you dead sure you didn’t
drop down to Ryan’s now?”

SPRING
SKIN TROUBLES.
PIMPLES, BOILS, SPOTS, RASHES AND
KINDRED SEASONABLE ERUPTIONS BANISHED.
M
r
e
WITH the advent of Spring, do you
find little rough patches on your
forehead, cheek or chin ? Has your
skin a curious “tight” feeling? Or is it
disfigured by pimples, boils, abscesses or
eruptions ?
These “danger signals,” which constitute
the first signs of an unhealthy skin, should
never be neglected. Following in their train
are all the tortures of fiery eczema, blood-
poison and ulcerous sores.
Zam-Buk is the ideal Spring Skin-balm,
and is unexcelled for all eruptions, gather-
ings and inflammation of the skin and
tissues. Zam=Buk is so refined that the
tissues absorb it readily, and its medicinal
essences at once attack the disease below
the surface. Zam-Buk is thus thorough in
action and reliable in result.
FACE COVERED WITH PIMPLY ERUPTIONS.
Mr, J. Parish, of Berry Street, Spring: llill, Brisbane, writes:
“Pimples broke out on my face, and merged into one another
until the whole of my face was in a very inflamed and
unsightly condition. I tried various remedies,‘but the eruption
got worse, and made me worry fearfully. Then someone recom-
mended Zam-Buk, and I soon realised that in Zam-Buk 1 had
found the real remedy. As 1 continued the treatment, the irri-
tation was stopped and the sore places dried up and gradually-
disappeared, leaving nice new skin behind.’’
Zam-Buk is unsurpassed for Eczema, Sores, Eruptions,
Cuts, Burns, Bruises and Aches and Pains. Ail Chemists

O’Toole flushed angrily. “No, sir, I
didn’t!”
It was tiie sergeant’s profession to doubt
and test all statements. He carefully placed
one book on top of another, tidied up the
pens and then said softly, “It’ll have to
be your word !”
O'Toole swallowed his rage. ‘l'm telling
you the Hod’s truth, Sergeant. Of course I
can’t bring witnesses to prove it, but”——
“It’s not the first time you’ve missed what
you were after,” resumed the sergeant bit-
terly. “Now, when we were after Keegan,
years ago”
“Hoolan was speakin’ about that, too,”
broke in Murgle. “He reckons you were to
blame there, Sergeant. He says they would
have got Keegan easy if you hadn’t stopped
for. breakfast at Miller’s place.”
“It’s a damn lie!” roared the sergeant,
bringing his chair down with a crash that
shook the station. “If Hoolan says that, he
lies !”
"That’s right! I’ve heard him tell the
story a score of times,” corroborated O’Toole.
“Oh, you have, have you?” The boiling
sergeant turned on his subordinate. “So
you’ve stood there and listened while Hoolan
told his damn lies about me?”
"I didn’t know they were lies, Sergeant,”
corrected O’Toole gently. “I wasn’t in this
district at the time.”
“Dammit man, d'ye think it is the sort of
thing I’d do when there was a bank robber
to be caught ?”
“No! But it wouldn’t be much good me
contradictin’ Hoolan, who was here, unless
I could prove it!”
“Look here, now!” roared the sergeant,
pounding the desk. “I don’t need to prove
anythin’ to a slanderin’ cur like Hoolan ! My
word is better than his oath in any court.
I wouldn’t trouble to go out an’ get the evi-
dence it' it was lyin’ there in stacks! Hoolan
'an say what he likes—the dirty cur! I
know which of us this town would sooner
believe!” He tilted up his chair again and
lay back out of patience and words.
“Hoolan,” said Murgle softly. “Hoolan ’ud
swear a man’s life away !”
“He would that!” The,sergeant’s response
was in his heartiest manner. “I tell you
what,” he added impressively, addressing
both his auditors, “that Iloolan’s a damn bad
lot!”
“As bad as they make ’em!” added O’Toole
fervently.
“He’s got no use for either of yous!”
sighed Murgle.
"No ; and we’ve got no use for Mm /”
“I’m just waitin’ for Mister-blanky-
Hoolan !” hissed O’Toole viciously. “It only
needs one more conviction to shut his door
for good !”
“Oh, I wouldn’t worry if I was yous,”
said Murgle soothingly. “Look at me now !
I don’t take no notice of what he says ever
since I heard he was blamin’ me for talcin’
his rotten cabbages ! I don’ care what Hoolan
says My word’s as good as Hoolan’s any
day !” He looked at his companions in mis-
fortune for endorsement. “Ain’t it?” be
added appealingly.
They did the only thing they could do
under the circumstances—they said “Yes!”
Murgle picked up his battered liat and
twirled it on his finger. “If that cow Hoolan
ever says anything to me about them cab-
bages, I’ll tell him what yous jus’ said!
Ah, well, I better be goin’. So-long.” And
he went.
There was a long, thoughtful sileiice in
the little police-station.
“I wonder now if anyone saw me up that
tree ?”
“Of course someone saw you! Murgle
saw yOu !”
O’Toole swung round angrily. “Murgle!
If you- think that” He reached for his
cap again.
“Leave him alone!” The sergeant spoke
anxiously—almost angrily. “Leave Murgle
alone !”
O’Toole sat staring. The sergeant rose
and put on his cap to go to lunch.
“It’s no good trying to put the acid on in
these small towns; it only works in the city
—people don’t know too much about you
there.”
KODAK.
Helping Him Out.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE battalion was going into the line.
With the band at their head they
marched along the cobbled road between
the tall straight poplars. Backs bent
beneath their heavy gear, they trudged silent
and stern.
There was no forced merriment, no song.
They knew where they were going, and what
they had to do, and there was no hilarity or
excitement about it. They would come back
just the same, reduced in numbers but grim
and imperturbable still. They had been too
long at war to harbor any illusions. They
did their job and came back unmoved.
That is the spirit of the Australian Army.
Towards the rear of the column marched a
young lad with a white, set face. His eyes,
looking straight ahead, were opened wide.
His mouth, drawn a little at the corners, was
thin-lipped and hard. A casual observer
would not have looked twice at him, but to
men trained to read the signs his face was an
open book.
The big, quiet-faced stretcher-bearer who
inarched behind saw and understood, and.
understanding, sympathised. He spoke
quietly to the man beside him.
“Git an eyeful o’ the-kid. He’s just about
done up.”
“I’ve been Avatchin’ ’im,” came the reply.
“ ’E’s been right in it from the word go. that
lad, and ’e won't stand much more. Fooled
’em about ’is age. ’e did. and come away with
the first lot. ’E’s been in every stunt the
Battalion’s pulled off. Time ’e ’ad a rest.
Game as they make ’em, too, but you know
’ow it is ; nobody can stand this racket for
ever. ’E ought to be well out of it. ’Ad ’is
full issue, and that’s a fact.’’
The band had swung off to the side of the
road to let the Battalion pass. Above the
blare and thud of the noisy music came a dull
rumble like a continuous roll of thunder.
The boy heard. Every overwrought nerve in
his body writhed in protest and shrieked to
him to go no further. He set his mouth a
little firmer and marched on apparently un-
moved.
They left the road and wound in single file
along a duckboard track. The rumble had
grown into a fierce, threatening growl punc-
tuated by heavy jarring thuds close at hand.
They were among the heavies.
The twilight was deepening into night.
They were due to arrive at the line just a-
it was dark enough to “take over” unseen b,.
the enemy.
A distant whine rising quickly to a shriek
terminated suddenly in a coughing roar,
fountain of earth and smoke leaped u
twenty yards on their right. There were
quick, hurried whisperings in the air and ;
pattering on the earth as the shell-splinters
flew.
They trudged on unflurried. All except
the boy, who ducked his head like a man
dodging a blow, and then flushed painfully a
he looked around. The stretcher-bearer wa
watching.
“I never seen ’im do that before,” he said
to his mate. “If one gits anywhere near him
that kid’ll go to the pack. You watch.”
* * * *
It was dawn. Against the pale glow in
the east an occasional trench-flare streaked
upwards and descended, an impotent speck
of light. The air shuddered under the migh
blows of the guns keeping a barrage on the
German lines. Now and again a machine-
gun chattered hysterically, but for the most
part the front line was quietly digging itself
in.
The slight mist which had aided the ad-
vance was vanishing slowly, as if reluctant
to reveal the mangled earth it screened.
Torn and blasted by the barrage, the once
fertile countryside presented a scene of un-
paralleled desolation. Here a blackened stump
that had once been a tree, there the wreck-
age of a trench, and dotted about, queer,
huddled figures that had once been men. A
sweating team, lashed unmercifully by their
cursing drivers, plunged and struggled to get
a gun into position over the churned and
riven ground.
The enemy’s lire had died down to an occa-
sional spasmodic shelling. He was busy
enough, no doubt, withdrawing his guns to
safety.
Picking their way round the shell-holes
were two men, one carrying a stretcher on
his shoulder. They were making their way
to the line. Their faces were drawn and
haggard, their eyes bloodshot. They walked
heavily as if burdened with an intolerable
weariness. They had been carrying wounded
all night, and were going back again for vet
another.
Presently, as they approached the entrance
to a wrecked trench, the man with the
stretcher jumped into a shell-hole, pulling his
companion after him and motioning for
silence. There was a dead man in the hole,
but of him they took no notice. Dead men
were common enough there.
A figure was coming stealthily out of the
trench. Dirty and ragged, without equip-
ment or arms, the boy pulled himself up and
looked fearfully around. His mouth was uo
longer drawn. It sagged open vacantly,
gasping lor air. His eyes rolled wildly. His
hands were tightly clenched as if to still their
trembling. He walked as if his legs could
scarcely support his weight.
i( “9 Gawd!” groaned the stretcher-bearer.
Ps running away. I knew it ’ud come.
Look at ini; got the wind up properly. And
e used to be so game.”
He clutched fiercely at his companion’s
arm.
, “ Ij °ak ’ere, I like that kid. ’E’s a good
un. Will you stick to me and say nothing
about what I am goin’ to do?”
A silent questioning nod gave him all the
assurance he needed, for those two were
cobbers” of long standing.
He reached for the dead man’s rifle and
drew himself quietly to the lip of the shell-
hole.
It s all right, ” lie said in answer to his
companion s look. “I won't hurt ’im—much.”
the shaip crack of the rifle was lost in
the roar of the guns.
* * * *
The dressing-station had once been a barn.
Its walls had been reinforced with sandbags
its root patched with tarpaulin. The doctors,
worn and sleepless, went quietly about tlieir
ivork. attending as quickly as possible to the
constant stream of human wreckage that
drifted in from the battle-front.
Two men. stepping carefully round the
recumbent forms that littered the floor
carried a stretcher into the middle of the
barn and lowered it gently to the floor. On
‘t lay a ragged, dirty youth, a bloody ban-
dage round one of his legs.
Is he badly hurt?” asked one of the
doctors.
A cheerful grin cracked the dirt in the
boy s face.
“Hurt!” he chuckled. “Not so’s you’d
notice it. I got a bonzer blighty, that’s all !
Rest bit of luck since I joined up. Hotter
fag anybody?”
SYD NEY.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
All in the green and golden weather
Young Love and I ran wild together
Happy horns were blowing blithe
Through the leaves and grasses lithe,
And down the little dappled trees
Boy Summer shook his melodies.
Oh, the world was good and green,
And the wind blew white and clean,
With bee and bird alive with mirth
Because two sweethearts trod the earth,
Making all the morning sing
With their joyous triumphing.
All in the green and golden weather
Young Love and I knelt grave together,
On the mossy rocks and grev.
In the girlhood of the day. *
And underneath the magic sun
We pledged two little lives in one.
Oh, our hearts beat brave and high,
Looking upward to the sky,
And I was sure, and you were, too,
As kissing all our bodies through,
Sun and leaf and laughing air
Wed us to each other there.
