and what in the. ante-bellum days would ha
passed for an interesting drama is now
falsified by the grim facts of this war tha

an, one of the puny children of a hero of

ie of .warfare; and the American Ambassa-
r raises other disturbing thoughts. His
eory is that “people who think will never

ously ante-bellum. The author, being appar-
tly _a citizen of the Hesitates, makes the
surd mistake of showing that the chief

of the whole Plant, and cries;

Sonnets by Louis Lavater.
A FOREST AITAR.
I /sow one morning on a lonely peak
Wrapped shoulder-high in swirling valley -
YYllSt
A row of stately columns, white, sun-kissed,
Mse unadorned; tn formal grace pure Greek,
Egyptian m immensity; their bleak,
btorm-blasted summits flushed with ame-
thyst.
I saw, too, round their mighty bases twist
ljon( J^^ u °us, grey-blue scarves like incense-
That day I reached the mountain, lost in
ivonder,
To find gigantic gum-trees bleached and bare,
tor pnest a woodman whose heroic plunder
Of bole and branch was hallowed by the need
Uf wife and helpless new-born babe. My
Makes this an altar and his life a prayer.
MUSIC.
Whence is the spell of music? It derives
trom m an s primeval language ere the weight
Of common need made tongues articulate.
Wherever instinct leads or passion drives
lhe elemental speech of man survives —
In murmurs of maternal love, in hate
Of jealous rivals fighting for a mate,
in groans of victims yielding up their lives,
in pagans of their conquerors, in wails
Of agony or shouts of joy. As wide
It flings imagination's door we slide
Into a world wet with creation's dew
Where hid by countless worn from our view.
Ongantic shadowy shapes infest the vales.
AFTER THE STORM.
As children vex a lion in his cage
Themselves secure, the doorway barred and
locked,
WJ+i Cea -% ! hav f f railed at thee, have mocked
With gibe and jeer thine ineffectual raqe.
Ah, I was wrong! All those in every age
* ’ their prison-bars have
{>!!Ji a J d J, rjain wJ i e ? this huge bastion rocked
Before thee; and I learned their parentage.
AUd hand th ° U ' rt Spent ‘ No more « Rant’s
buffets the sounding rocks, but piteously
Ihou rangest the low shore with feeble fret.

THE SONNET.
But thou hast read how Cleopatra went
lo Anthony, her lustrous eyes a-shine
Through mazy webs of love fit to entwine
A simple conqueror palaced in a tent •
And blS her PeaH ’ ° monarch ’ s ransom,
Its iridescence with the sharp white wine
I To pleasure her, as with an air divine
She quaffed it to the Roman's dazzlement-
In such wise make, and take, a sonnet.
Throw
Into the wine, emotion, the pure pearl
Of artistry, and while ’tis yet a-swirl
And heading bravely, snare with subtile
craft
A gleam of golden light upon it — so!
Then drain it breathless at a single draught!
From "Blue Days and Greh Days”
(Sydney J. Endncott, Melb.).
Among the distinguished band of Aus-
tralasian sonneteers Louis Lavater, author
of Blue Days hnd Grey Days (Sydney J.
Endacott, Melb., 2s. 6d.), must be enrolled
He has aptly “placed” himself within hi
limitations:—
In place of battle-cry or thunder clap
Mine but the tinkle of guitar or spinet,
The piping of a captive lark or linnet,
A halting, hesitating sound mayhapj
For I but set a sonnet like a trap
Hoping to catch some fleeting fancy in it
And, “by way of apology,” he quotes John
Addington Symonds : “The very artificiality
of the vehicle, the fixity of the stanza,
renders it a source of strength to those who
are not, in a high sense, creative.... Such
do not demand the elbow-room oi
infinity; most of the greatest require it.
Ihereiore the ‘sonnet’s narrow plot’ is an
advantage for the former, an irksome limi-
tation for the latter.” But Louis Lavater
cultivates his narrow plot with a high seri-
ousness and a necessary dignity of lan-
guage. The latter is marred, however, by
occasional shop-worn literary phrases, such
as: a m onarch's ransom j compact of
sterner stuff; Hell-on-Earth; silence of the
tomb; it well-nigli breaks my heart • grown
" m(ln 8 estate; the day of reckoning; to
pin niy faith.” These, however, are his
only defects. His sonnets are thoughtful
and without cheap artifice, admirable
models of a verse-form in which Austral-
asians have shown themselves singularly
adept. This book of 30 sonnets includes
nothing unworthy of the dignified appear-
ance given it by its publisher. Louis
Lavater demands the serious study of his
fellow sonneteers.
Australasian
In the latest issue of J. H. Maiden’s The
Forest Blora of N.B.W. (vol. 6, part 5) the
author devotes many pages to the nationally
important subject of “Forests in their liela-
tion to Rainfall and the Conservation of
Moisture. ’ His conclusion is: Forests do
not increase rainfall; but they-conserve the
ram that falls, and therefore every effort
should be made to save them from unneces-
sary destruction. Maiden has put the
case fairly by extensive quotations, pro and
con, from acknowledged authorities. And
he adds to the testimony of overseas ex-
perts the observations and conclusions of
Australians. T. Kidson believes, for in-
stance, that the solidification of the soil by
the trampling of stock is the main cause of
water disappearing more rapidly than for-
merly from hilly country. In this way
creeks and waterholes, which formerly did
n !?t exist, are formed. As to the question
ot_ the value or harm of ring-barking
opinions astonishingly vary; but Maiden
pleads for more intelligent control of ring-
barking. And when speaking of the effects
ot destruction of vegetation on the climate,
it is too frequently assumed that forest trees
are alone referred to. The destruction of
smaller vegetation, even of grass, may have
the same effect. Yet forests are of extreme
value m tempering floods. Maiden calls for
close study of the extent to which our rivers
have silted up. The Hawkesbury River was
m the early days navigable as far as Wind-
s2r ! or .l ar ge craft, but the navigation
of the river to any but the smallest boats
has long been impossible. What has
caused the silting? The indiscriminate
cuttmg down of the forests in the water-
*e<Lof tne Hawkesbury, and the cultivation
or the land too close to the river banks.
Forests also conserve springs. Yet the
felling of trees apparently changes inter-
mittently dry creek-beds into permanent
streams. Maiden instances cases on the
catchment area of the Sydney Water Sup-
ply. The Cataract River rises in densely
timbered country, with a rainfall of (say)
GO inches, and yet it is an intermittent
stream; while the Cordeaux River, rising in
much more sparsely timbered country, and
cleared up to nearly the head of the river
never ceases to flow. Maiden' notes: “It
may have, been that the absorption and
transpiration of the water by the trees is
gieater than by the grass, which increased
m the ring-barked country. It seems like
an argument in favor of cutting down forest
trees to improve the moisture conditions of
the country. Or it may have been that the
ram ran off this particular area of country
as a forest, or scattered forest, more rapidly
than when the surface was covered with
grass. The question of conservation of
moisture is many sided, and must be con-
sidered in all its bearings in order to form
just conclusions.” Maiden, therefore, asks
for further research upon this highly
important subject. He concludes a valuable
certain amount of rain falls upon
N.S.W. Do we take care that it will do us
most good, and remain with us, benefiting us
as long as possible? Many public questions
that loom large in the public e.ye should
really claim less attention than this.”

Freda du Faur, a Sydney girl, was th
nrst woman to make the ascent of Moun
C_ook,_ M.L., with, of course, the assistant
of guides. Her lavishly produced book, Th
Conquest of Mount Cook (Alien and Unwin
16s. in England), contains some of th
finest photographs of Alpine scenery ye
published. Miss du Faur, the omission o
whose portrait is a mistake, but also
confession of the author’s modesty, is ev
dently a mountaineer of experience anc
bravery, and shows herself the pleasan
writer of an interesting book. Indeed, he
work challenges comparison with any wor
yet written about the magnificent climbin
ground of the Southern Alps. The feminin
touch delicately introduces itself in wha
has been so long regarded as pre-eminently
sport for males. Thus, when, early in he
experience, she decided to climb Moun
bealy alone with a guide, the company a
the Hermitage became a mob of Mrs
Crundies. No other woman would, or coulc
accompany her, and one old lady implorec
her with tears in her eyes “not to spoil my
life for so small a thing as climbing i
mountain.” Ultimately she had to com
promise by taking a porter with them, paying
il a day for this excrescence. Another inti
mation of the author’s sex is the charming
confession that when she stood on the sum
mit of Mount Cook she felt “very little, very
lonely, and much inclined to cry,” and she
earnestly asked her guides if it were
re f] ly ’ truly the summi t of Mount Cook.”
Adventures and escapes she records in
plenty. And her record is one to rest com-
rortably upon. Besides many lesser
climbs she took part in two attempts a
Mount Cook, the second successful, and she
was, with her guides, the first to make the
complete traverse of Mount Cook, the first
and apparently, to date, the last. But she
admits that for this undertaking they were
iavorea with ideal weather; without which
au expedition such as this would have beer
exceedingly Also Miss du Faur
made the first traverse of Mount Sefton.
And she has no hesitation in giving to her
guides the full credit for her various suc-
cesses. ‘borne day,” she admits, “I hope to
tackle some of the giants of the Himalayas,
and I ask no better fate than to be led up
them by one of my Maoriland guides.”

20, 16 AND 12 GAUGE
Lightweight Hammerless
Repeating Shotguns
The Winchester Model 1912 is the strongest, safest and
most perfect repeating shotgun ever made. In either of the
three gauges in which it is made, it is lighter, better
balanced and more correctly proportioned than any other

Tooth Paste.
“I simply can’t account for this
trouble with my teeth —and I’ve
been so particular to keep them
immaculately clean always.” This
is the complaint of thousands.
It’s just this way, Madam.
You’ve spent your time watching
the highwaymen robbers of tooth-
health —Decay Germs —and for-
got all about their sly, insidious
accomplice, “Acid Mouth.” Acids
are constantly forming in the
mouth. They are constantly
“working.” But they work
“incognito.”
And here lies the danger.
These mouth-acids, unmolested,
unsuspected, gradually dissolve,
and break down the enamel. The
tooth then becomes easy prey to
decay germs.
Look out for “acid mouth,”
that filcher and falcon of healthy
tooth life. Pebeco Tooth Paste
users have a good chance to keep
their teeth for life.

Mouth.

BONNINGTON’S
A CHARMING FIGURE
Within Every Woman’s Reach
The lack of a well-rounded, nicely-formed bust deprives a woman
of four-fifths of the charm that would otherwise be hers... .Are your
cheeks sunken and hollow? Have you deep lines around your mouth
and eyes? Are your arms thin and scrawny? And is your chest flat
and your bosom undeveloped? Do your shoulder-blades and the “salt-
cellars” that form at your throat make evening dress almost a tragedy ?
Are you so thin that your clothes merely hang on you?
MRS. V. GRAHAM, of Stanley Street, Richmond, tells in the fol-
lowing letter of her release from the thraldom of poor development
and deficient figure:—
“Your treatment is wonderful, and I have to thank
Dr. FALLIERE’S FLESH-FOOD for not only restoring
my health, hut for building up my figure and develop-
ing my bust to my entire satisfaction. I am better in
every way from its use, and it did exactly what you
claimed it would from its use, and even more quickly than you stated.”
In many cases bust measurements have been increased by over ten inches, and the gain in
actual weight—equally distributed over the body in generally deficient cases —has been over five
pounds weekly. Some other cases have shown an increase in weight of even a pound a day. The
average bust increase desired is about six inches, and is readily accomplished. Results guaranteed.
FLESH-ROOD offers relief and development to the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to attenuated women. We have not space here, but
if you will write or call, we will give you hundreds of testimonials from grateful, happy women.
LET US SEND YOU A FREE TRIAL SAMPLE.
We want you to know just what FLESH-FOOD is, and will gladly give you a free sample.
Send a 2d. stamp, and let us forward a free trial sample and our instructive book on attenuation,
“LOVELY WOMAN.” FLESII-FOOD is put up in tablet form, and can be secretly taken if de-
sired. All correspondence is confidential and private, and all our literature is. sent closely
covered and free from observation. Write at once. You are placed und er no obligation what-

have been completely cured of the Tobacco Habit by

tobacco, and, although I am continually in the corn-

“My general health is now perfect; all my former
complaints, such as irregular Heart Action, Dizzi-

have every reason to believe were caused through the
use of tobacco, have entirely disappeared, and are

I long to write it down.
All, all we saw that day—
The leaves of gold and brown
That fluttered o’er our way ;
The silver lines of poplar trees
That twinkled starlike in the breeze ;
The lawns and flow’r beds bright,
The sunshine bathing you ; _
The elms, shot through with light,
The sky of cloudless blue;
The magic avenues of shade
Where Mern’ry wandered unafraid.
The water-god bent low
Beneath the scallop deep.
Whose sparkling waters flow
His time-worn feet to steep;
The birds about the fountain rim
Who sang their happy songs to him.
The trees with crests of gold,
The lake’s mysterious sheen,
The confidence half-told
And all that might have been....
The glamor of the autumn haze
That fell upon our parting ways.
I long to write it down,
All, all we saw that day —
The distant lights of town,
That pierced the evening grey.
And all T failed to say and do

Sans Souci.
Whether the name contains
Something appealing.
Or there are other things
That stir my feeling
Strangely I cannot tell.
(Luscious was Lucy.)
Though there are fairer shores
I love Sans Souci!
It is a tender spot
In my heart’s treasures
Of fair, fond memories,
Of vanished pleasures.
Truly its title hints
Pleasure to borrow,
Days on a dreamy shore —
Sans care, sans sorrow!
There, on a slope that basks
In sunny weather,
Lucy and I would
Long hours together.
Little cared we for time,
Trouble or money;
Life was a dream to us— ■
Wild flowers and honey.
Though she is gone from me,
Lucy so slender
Still stays in memory,
Faithful and tender.

The Siren.
Why did I heed you calling,
And why did you call to me,
For I was a landsman ever,
And you are a child of the sea?
Ah, but Love were a folly always; I follow
who, wise, would flee.
Green tresses that swirl about you
I fear, but I make no flight;
While you, with your eyes’ blue wonder,
Lure on to those lips’ delight,
To those beckoning arms, wet-satined, held
out from the combers’ white.
Oh, it’s O for the quiet homestead,
For the grass and the plash of the rain.
For the swish of the leaves, wind-troubled.
For the dust of the plains again....
But the madness for you is on me with an
urge of relentless pain !
Blue-eyed, green-haired, red-lipped one,
Though it kill, wilt a kiss deny?
Sea sweet, or a ruthless Siren
And the End of it all be nigh,
I come, for I must, to love you ; or come, if
you will, to die!

The Legend of St. Just.
Avaunt! Ye cannot break the shield of Time
Against a wreath of harvest blighted red.
Cold memory rejoices in the dread
Of ethnic wonder granulating crime.
To all the elder tears by cold eyes shed
Upon the stones of Etna, and the breach
In Babylon’s brown walls, as Syndics teach.
Leave us alone. The purposes of truth
Are harried by the crocus-beetling moon.
We know the path, salt-red, that leads too
soon
Down friendless valleys void of faintest ruth
And tremulous to no wild after-tune.
Leave us alone. Here where the melon sighs.
Sun-wintered, is the home-haunt of the wise.
Ye spake too loudly. This were scathe to
them
Whose hands uphold the mystic horus-truth,
Tent-smitten in a place of balm and Booth,
Beyond the utmost sweep of human hem.
Unkept, uncorned, uncalcined and uncouth,
The low day floods the vast with elfin pearl,
Trampling foot-red upon the amethwhearl.
Alone we wrought it. Never throb of drum
Or blare of trumpet sounded through the
night.
One star, a little pale, leant to the flight
Of our strong spearcraft. All the worlds
were dumb.
And through the darkling rifts of anthracite.
Smokeless as doom, we smote the front of
day
Clear in the minstered forehead of decay.

AN IDEAL
FLOOR POLISH
It :s a very simple matter to polish up the
iinohum if you use Shi-r.oleum. It is easy to
apply, quick in action and wonderfully eco-
nomical. Shi-noleum does away with the
drudgery, and you can get a better polish with
half the labor that is needed with the old-
fashioned watery creams. It gives a dry,
glossy surface that does not gather dust, and
its shine lasts a long time.
Be sure you get Shi-noleum. All wide-awake
storekeepers stock it.

STATE SPITES AND MURRAY
WATERS.
A common feature of the machinations of
the Australian provincialist is that they are
not merely hoglike in their selfishness; they
are also idiotic. Where they succeed they
usually do more harm than good to the
parties whom it is desired to benefit. The
delay in the construction of the Finley-
Tocumwal railway was theoretically a bit
of State patriotism calculated to benefit N.
S. Wales. The effect of it has been to cost
N. S. Wales hundreds of thousands sterling.
The N.S.W. producers who would have
saved money by getting their wares to
market via Victoria lost, on the one hand ;
and, on the other, those N. S. Wales pro-
ducers whose natural trade outlet was Port
Jackson lost through having the wheat and
wool of the Riverina choking up their rail-
ways. Successive N. S. Wales Governments
have blocked the creation of new coastal
cities, by the expedients of differential rail-
way rates and a policy of keeping the rail-
ways away from the deep-water ports, and
they have done it in the name of N. S.
Wales. (It is of no importance that they
did it really in the interests of Sydney.)
Nominally the procedure was the purest
form of State patriotism. Really it was a
prize sample of imbecility. The State loses
immeasurably by having one city so bloated
that it can’t handle the business which pours
into it, instead of several cities of a reason-
ably bloated character. And the city suffers
almost as badly as the State. The vested
interests of Sydney—and it is vested inter-
ests that guide the footsteps of the State
politician, both Labor and Liberal —would
gain in the long run by the creation of large
industrial centres at Port Stephens and
Jervis Bay. The big city institutions would
achieve in return for the shadow of conges-
tion the meaty bone of natural trade. Their
share of the business in the new centres would
be great. But the provincial patriot won’t
see it. And now this national calamity is
at. work in Victoria along the old, mis-
guided lines. Victoria has everything to
gain by an amicable and speedy settlement
of the Murray .Waters question. Most Vic-
torians are anxious to see the wretched row
ended on almost any reasonably equitable
terms. The agreement of 1914 was ex-
tremely favorable to Victoria, all things
considered. Yet at this late hour the State
Rights crowd has begun to clamor in the
name of State patriotism that the local
Parliament shall fling the entire scheme
overboard. It. is the dull, stubborn and
short-sighted parish politician at his worst.
The agreement which a section of Vic-
toria is urging the Assembly not to ratify
was arrived at —after decades of argument
and abuse and innuendo and threatened liti-
gation—about a year ago. That it contained
the elements of all-round fairness is
best shown by the fact that it was approved
by the Premiers and Ministries of all'-the
States; by the Australian Government of
the day; and by The leading irrigation
experts, including Victoria’s own first-rate
man, Elwood Mead. 'The general idea was
to minimise the wh.ste of the article which
Australia can least afford to lose, by the
creation of locks and barrages. The State
Righters of South Australia had stood out
in the past for a volume of water sufficient
to permit of navigation at all titnes—a con-
dition obviously fatal to N. S. Wales and
Victorian irrigation in dry seasons. In
1914, for the first time, S. Aus. indicated
that it had got sense on this point, and let
it be understood that it regarded the traffic
question as of secondary importance. That
cleared the air vastly. It was decided that
the Commonwealth should contribute
£1,000.000 towards the £4,663,000 required
to lock the entire river, and that N. S.
Wales, Victoria and S. Aus. should pay the
rest in equal shares. It is true that S. Aus.
never specifically abandoned its ancient navi-
gation claim. But the position is the same
as though it had. In the first place, it is
never likely to want to enforce it, since the
S Aus. railways are cutting deeply into the
old-time river traffic, and tend to do so more
and more as the years pass by. In the
second place, no sane court of law would
uphold such a claim as against those of
established agricultural interests dependent
on the Murray waters for their existence.
It is this phantom menace that the Vic-
torian State Righter has now started to
fight. He doesn’t exactly say so. A sort
of elephantine disingenuousness is among
the qualities of the provincial patriot. In
point of fact, the most popular argument
in favor of turning down the agreement and
re-starting the disputes of the past 30 years
is based on a casual remark by the Victorian
Attorney-General (who is, of course, in
favor of the scheme, being one of the orig-
inal parties to it) about N. S. Wales hav-
ing sovereign rights over the Murray. The
Victorian citizen who wants to burst the
agreement says sanctimoniously, in the
words of the Age (28/4/T5) :
Surely this State is not such a pirate as to take
advantage of a neighbor. If New South Wales has
exclusive rights in the Murray and has parted with
some of them to us in ignorance, common honesty
demands that we should make her fully aware of the
position, and give her an opportunity to retract and
reconsider. , Victorians are not thieves and robbers
to be hustled into a compact of dishonor by the
lure of profiting at another, unsuspecting, State’s
expense. We want nothing from New South Wales
to which we are not justly entitled.
But the same paper gives the show away
badly in another issue, as follows :
Ihe most that the advocates of the agreement pro-
mise Victoria is that for its share of the total expen-
diture at least, £1,500,000—-it will be able to
irrigate another 100,000 acres. The area is so small
that if this State be thus restricted its hopes of irri-
gation for the future are a delusion.
Considering that the whole irrigable valley
land along the Murray in Victoria has been
estimated at about 1,250,000 acres, and
considering furthermore that many thou-
sands of acres of this land are already irri-
gated, it doesn’t seem on the face of it that
tne Cabbage State is threatened with any
great wrong. And neither it is. Its State
patriots don’t want to obviate a wrong.
Their real aim is to go on getting something
for nothing. If the Assembly does the right
thmg, and puts the agreement through
without delay, Victoria will have to pre-
sently find £1,221,000 for locks and
barrages. If it doesn’t, the money will be
saved, and Mildura and the rest of the Vic-
torian irrigation settlements will be in a
position to continue using the Murray.
To the State patriot whose national
hymn is “My Province, ’tis of Thee,” the
correct line of conduct, in such circum-
stances, is as visible as sheet lightning on a
dark night.
* * * *
This, however, is where the provincialist
may fall in, with tragic results to his State.
Ihe Law is not invariably asinine, more
especially where broad principles are con-
ears a £° so sound an authority as
Chief-Justice Way, of S. Aus., held that
none of the States served by the Murray
had a legal right to take any of its water.
In Common Law the dwellers on a river are
obliged to use it with careful reference to the
rights of those lower down. This is a prin-
ciple which applies all over the civilised
world. The irrigationists of Normandy, and
elsewhere in France, are as careful to abide
by it as those of Hampshire, of Italy and of
Switzerland. If South Australia, wearying
of 30 years’ resultless argument on the Mur-
ray question, decided tp drag N. S. Wales
and Victoria through a possibly hostile local
Court to the Privy Council, a situation dis-
tinctly awkward for the dragged States would
almost certainly be created. In the opinion of
most lawyers, N. S. Wales and Victoria have
not, and never have had, any right to divert
a drop of water from the Murray at the
expense of South Australia. The Murrum-
bidgee, inasmuch as it feeds the Lachlan,'
which feeds the Murray, is not entirely, the
property of N. S. Wales, nor is the Darling';
and the Loddon and Campaspe and Goulburn
are only owned conditionally, as it were, by
Victoria. Neither of these States, for ex-
ample, could exploit the streams which belong
to their territories to the detriment of the
river which belongs to Australia. It is
likely, therefore, that at any time in the
past South Aus. could, by going to law, have
got an injunction agaipst the N. S. Wales
and Vicjtorian irrigationists. As has already
been lemaiked, no Court is likely to grant
such an injunction now. While South Aus-
tialia has slept on its rights, Renmark and
Mildura has come into being, and the Law
does not lightly interfere with beneficent in-
stitutions of that sort. But what a body
like the Privy Council could, and doubtless
would, say is: “The acquisition of. the old
light gives you no authority to claim new
ones. Go on irrigating your present settle-
T?u S \ e / en thou S h their thirsty soil takes out
ot the Murray many million more gallons than
it ever returns, but you shall not have the
water for further irrigation schemes, unless
by agi cement with the co-owners further
down the stream.” And farewell, then, to
Victoria’s hopes of irrigating a million, and
N. S. Wales’s prospects of dealing with over
four million, additional acres of farming land
in the future!
* * * *
If ever there was a case for the rejection
of the State Rights gospel and the adoption
of a middle way by all parties it is this. Vic-
toria, by turning down the agreement which
its own Premier and Ministry and irrigation
expert approved, will save, for the moment,
its contribution to the cost of locking; "but it
will stand to lose in augmented land values
—assuming a local Court or the Privy Coun-
cil takes the ordinary Common Law view of
the rights of the various owners of the
Murray as much as would finance a minor
European war. N. S. Wales is in the same
position, except that it stands to sacrifice as
much as would keep Armageddon going for
about a year. As regards the attitude of
houth _Aus. there is no need to worry. What
Victoria affects to fear that it may do—
namely, claim sufficient water in drought
time, for the navigation which it doesn’t
now require, to ruin the irrigation settle-
ments up-stream—would be done only by a
State which was a criminal lunatic. The
real obstacle in the way of an agreement
advantageous to all parties—one that would
end an expensive row which has raged for
oyer a quarter of a century, while countless
billions of gallons of fresh water have been
pouring themselves into the ocean—is the
Australian parochialist. An awful and abid-
ing calamity is this type of citizen.
THE DESPERATE MOVE OF SOME
NEW SOUTH WALES CITIZENS.
Stowed unobtrusively away in an odd
corner of a Sydney daily there appeared
this tremendous announcement the other
morning:—
The Grafton separation committee in connection
with the movement for the formation of a new State
in northern New South Wales, has intimated that
the convention will be held in Armidale during the
last week in May, or early in June.
An immense area of N. S. Wales, from
lvempsey to the Darling on the West and
to Tweed Heads on the North, proposes to
throw off its allegiance and start out on
its own account, and Sydney takes no more
notice than if a dog had howled once and
then fled into the night. For Sydney has
become hardened to the cries of the North
and the rage of the South. There was a
time, years ago, when the city grabbed all
that was going in the way of trade with a
certain amount of shamefacedness. In
those days Commissions used regularly to
be appointed to examine into the state of
the starved ports and their back country
and see if things really were as bad as
alleged. The Wade Government appointed
the last of them in 1910. Earnest officials
went to places like Coif’s Harbor and
Jervis Bay and Port Stephens, and dis-
covered that they were indeed without rail-
way communication, and wharves and
banks and picture-shows, and they came
back to civilisation and said so. This
proved that the Wade Government was not
paltering on the subject of decentralisation,
and justified a further period of inaction
A decentralisation policy has been a
feature of every N. S. Wales politician’s
travelling kit since the beginning of things.
Old John Robertson had one; See had
one; so had Wade, and so has Holman.
lhe thing that maddens the country is that
the policy never gets any forwarder. Each
party as _ soon as it reaches office treats
Decentralisation as the visionary aspiration
of some well-meaning imbecile, and sub-
scribes to the view that there must be only
one pebble on the N.S.W. beach, only one
shark in the State sea, only one spider to
absorb all the flies of commerce, and that the
diverse animal shall be Sydney.
* * * *
The cynical way in which the big city
has always seized everything possible for
itself, at the expense of the rest of the
State, constitutes a world’s record in its
way. Harbors which would seriously rival
Port Jackson if they were developed lie
north and south of it. One of the several
land-locked bays of Port Stephens could
accommodate the P. and O. fleet. Behind
it stretches, for miles, Crown territory as
flat as the country on which Melbourne js
built. The harbor of which this bay forms
a small part is the natural outlet for the
trade of most of the Northern and North-
western districts of N. S. Wales—trade
which at present crawls by devious routes
and at vast expense and loss, so far as the
primary producer is concerned, to Sydney.
If Port Stephens were linked up with the
\Valgett-Narrabri7Maitland line, which
would incidentally bring it into touch
with the Moree-Inverell-Barraba-Tamwortli
country, the settlers in those parts would
find that their goods cost less in transit,
that the articles got to market quicker, and
that in consequence less of them were
ruined on the way. In short, trade would
be diverted from Sydney. And that is why
the railway line after it leaves Newcastle
proceeds north-west to Maitland and then
branches off to avoid one ,of the finest
natural harbors in the world. Jervis Bay
is in many respects a better harbor than
either Port Jackson or Port Stephens. A
coastal railway runs through Port Kembla,
Wollongong and Iviama (none of which
are fitted by nature to shelter so much as
a mud-barge in unfavorable weather), and
ends in a sudden and apparently purpose-
less manner at Nowra. The explanation
of the seemingly inexplicable is that if it
was carried any farther it would bring up
at Jervis Bay, which might result in the
system being connected with the main
Southern line near Goulburn. A number
of calamities would at once result. In the
first place, a portion of the State’s starving
stock and congested wheat problems would
be- in danger of solution. The produce of
the country formed by the Hay-Coota-
mundra-Wyalong triangle, most of the
trade of the Monaro, and pretty well all
the business between Goulburn and Cowra
would gravitate to the beautiful stretch of
water which is at present bounded partly
by the Naval College and for the rest bv
primeval wilderness. The State would
gain, but Sydney might lose, and so Jervis
Bay is kept as isolated on the one side as
Port Stephens is on the other.
The Grafton separation movement is a
measure of desperation. The agitators are
people who have got sick o£ Decentralisa-
tion Commissions, and regard all poli-
ticians as liars. They have come to
understand that votes talk under the
Party system, and that if the Sydney vote
were strong five years ago it is stronger
to-day and may be stronger still in five
years’ time. So they are seizing oppor-
tunity by the forelock and trying to do some
good for themselves and their districts
before things have a chance to get worse.
But is a small, lonely separation movement,
hatched at a time like this, by people of no
particular prominence or magnetism, in an
out of the way corner of a somewhat weary
old State, likely to produce valuable
results? The chances are wholly against
it, Queensland’s Northern and Central
separation movements, though they were
obvious necessities and had much
enthusiasm and money behind them, raged
for long years, and then fell down
exhausted. The different separation move-
ments in the U.S.A. represented decades of
work and underground engineering and
boodling. An easier, quicker and likelier
method for the Grafton separationists to
get what they want would be for them to
become Unificationists —for unification is,
of course, indissolubly bound up with
reconstruction. In rough figures about a
third of the inhabitants of the whole of
Australia are in the same plight as the
Grafton and Armidale people. As Unification-
ists the latter would have at their backs not
only the electors of Kyogle and Collaren-
dabri, but neople living at Temora and
.Tunee, at Broken Hill and Cairns and
Townsville. They would also have the
moral support of many thousands of others
who are not personally interested. If
Sydney interests were as easy to fight now
as they were in the ’fifties of last century
there might be some point in the northern
and north-western parts of N. S. Wales
attempting to break loose and run their
businesses in their own way. But the
position is so wholly different that a
successful separation movement will have to
be general and not sectional.
A LETTER FROM A MAN IN THE
MOON.
Stirred, apparently, at a recent statement
by Attorney-General Hughes that the Refer-
enda questions will again be submitted to
the people of Australia, George Beeby,
who, while N.S.W. Minister for Lands, cut
the painter that joined him to the Hol-
man Government, writes to The Bulletin :
The six questions mean Unification, and would, if
adopted, make our system of government so complex
that from sheer necessity we would be forced to go
the whole hog and vest sovereign powers on all
important questions in the Federal Parliament. I
am not objecting to this if the basis of the Consti-
tution is altered and the National Parliament is
made to represent the people of Australia, and not
States. But our Constitution was deliberately framed
on a Federal basis for federal purposes, and if we
now desire to vest the full power of government in
the National Legislature, that basis must first be
altered, so as to secure the right of the majority of
Australians, and not of Australian States, to deter-
mine all important questions. Even now, if we
could get an amendment guaranteeing the right of
the majority of Australians, irrespective of States,
to demand a vote by means of the initiative, and to
vote by means of the referendum, on all important
questions, many of us would not worry about'' the
Senate; it would soon die of inanition. But until
the ultimate right of majority rule is assured, plenty
of good Nationalists will vote “No” to Unification,
whether proposed openly or cloaked in the six-ques-
tion disguise.
In other words, George Beeby will resist to
the last ditch any extension of power to
the National Parliament until the basis of
the Constitution is altered ; and he will do
so notwithstanding that the powers asked
for were supposed by himself and everyone
else to have been granted to the Common-
wealth by the Constitution. But he will not
resist nor will he bother about the basis if
the initiative and referendum are given him
on the democratic foundation of votes, for
then the weight of territorial representation
will, he believes, succumb to lack of nour-
ishment, and the basis will be shattered
beyond recognition.
Meantime, however, it may be pointed out
that the Commonwealth has a Constitution-;
that it has been found to have as many holes
as the domestic colander; that it doesn’t
give the people anything like the authority
they imagined it did; and that the need for
amendment in one direction or another is not
seriously denied. Therefore the question
arises: At what point shall the work of
restoration and change begin, and how shall
it be proceeded with? Allied problems in
relation to time and cost and expediency
immediately present themselves, just as
similar issues arise to test the ingenuity of
an engineer who, in laying out the con-
struction of a railroad, finds himself con-
fronted by a mountain. For him there are
five possible courses. He can go round the
thing; he can go over it; he can go through
it; he may even remove the exasperating
protuberance in a multitude of wheelbarrows
—or he can stand afar off and announce that,
an unwise Providence having placed unex-
pected difficulties in the way of travel, he
can do nothing until the mountain is lifted
off its base in one large lump. Then, while
the populace is rent in 15 places by uproar
and faction, some local Fisher will appear
on the scene with a project to build a
strategic railway in a totally different direc-
tion, and there will ensue so much more riot
and confusion that the people who started
the row will be dead before the second-rum-
pus ends, and the engineer and his scheme
will have been forgotten. Unless Mr. Beeby
wants to be in the position of this lamen-
tably infertile dodger of difficulties, and
wishes to start the Australian community off
on a prolonged pursuit of red herrings, he
will throw aside the doctrinaire timidity
which now paralyses him, and recognise that
a rough road is only made smooth by being
trimmed and rolled and used. To ask Aus-
tralia now to choose between standing still
in an impotent pretence of nationhood, and
going back to start all over again, is unphilo-
sophic and futile


The people are masters of the Constitu-
tion ; the Constitution is not master of the
people. And it is there that the oppor-
tunity for grappling with circumstances,
some of which were not anticipated and
some of which were of inevitable develop-
ment, must be sought. Nothing could very
well be more unhelpful than to suggest re-
embarking on the long, toilsome spade work
which preceded the manufacture of the
machinery the nation finds itself working
with. The only possible line of action is to
adjust the working parts to the necessities
of the tasks to be performed, and that ad-
justment can best be commenced from
inside. It is no use making the Senate a
bugbear—an excuse for permanent inacti-
vity—for at the worst that institution
is immeasurably better than any other sec-
ond chamber Australians have any personal
acquaintance with. The people allow six
mummified State Upper Houses, representa-
tive of nothing but special interests and
fossilised prejudices, to mangle the work of
really representative bodies; and for such
people to argue that the National Legis-
lature must be sterilised because the Senate
can “determine all important questions” is
pitifully illogical. In point of fact, the
Senate cannot determine all important ques-
tions. But apart from that the allegedly
good Nationalists whom Beeby asserts will
vote, until the gates and barbed-wire fences
have all been levelled, against any step
towards the Unification they want, are
sadly blind to the direction in which public
opinion is forming itself even in quarters
where State Spites found richest susten-
ance. The duplication of Parliamentary
powers in the field of taxation, the hideous
wastage of the national credit by the
States, and the now more than alarming
growth of indebtedness are forcing even the
most, bitter opponents of unity to recognise
the grave dangers inherent in the present
system. Reconstruction is as inevitable
as the day after to-morrow. But it
is not likely to come otherwise than
by first giving the National Parlia-
ment that wider scone wh ; ch every
honest controversialist will admit it was
intended to be given. A reconstruction of
the States will follow of economic and poli-
tical necessity; and good Nationalists will
find the obstacles to the referendum very
much less imposing then than they are to-
day. In helping to accomplish these things
George Beeby might be a practical
National benefactor. But if he is going to
remain remotely seated on the edge of a
cloud, proclaiming that, unless he sees all
the material for the new structure delivered
on the ground and is allowed to inspect the
plans and specifications, he will forthwith
drop bombs on whoever touches a brick,
then will he be only a nuisance and a weari-
ness.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Lusitania Outrage.
The sinking of the .Lusitania is another illus-
tration of the insanity of Peace societies.
For years the U.S.A. have looked on con-
temptuously while other nations armed.
They were proud to think that they were
piling up the dollars while the other nations
were making fools of themselves, and they
said so. Now the inevitable has happened
and a powerful fleet, well manned, would be
worth to the U.S.A. all the dollars they
have made in the past. Germany’s attitude is
evidently this. The U.S.A. are trading with
the Allies, as in law they have a right to do.
Many of the articles most needed by the
United Kingdom—foodstuffs and munitions,
for example—are being sent from New York
in the holds of the great liners. The vast
passenger lists have been regarded hitherto
by the consignees as a sort of insurance on
their goods. And so they would be, if the
U.S.A. were a country dangerous to annoy—
like Italy, for example. But the U.S.A.
can’t hurt Germany any more than they
have done in the past nine months. If they
tried to, their position would be that of an
elderly gentleman who attempted to serve
a summons for assault in the midst of a
street riot. And they can’t help Germany
unless the British fleet is destroyed and the
blockade raised. In fact, so far as the
Fatherland is concerned, the vast Republic is
a negligible proposition. Further, no
of. ordinary humanity, or
decency influence the ghouls who are
running the war from the Teuton end.
All these things being so, the destruc-
tion of the great Atlantic liners and
the incidental slaughter of their passengers
is an obvious move. If the U.S.A. had a fleet
that could make a serious difference when
the great issue is decided in the North Sea,
it would be Germany’s while to be
circumspect. But they haven’t. And they
cannot have anything of the sort for many
years. Meanwhile the U.S.A. may expect
to see American citizens murdered unresist-
ingly in cold blood, and American goods sent
to the bottom of the ocean. It is part of
the price which the Republic must pay for
neglecting the means of Defence.
«
A. Party Which Is Out to Win.
In the coming Queensland elections compul-
sory voting will get a trial for the first time
in history. It is really the outcome of the
Liberal politician’s low opinion of the Lib-
eral elector. After each of the many
recent contests in which the Liberal
cause has gone down, the . party press
has pointed out that the disaster would
not have occurred out for Liberal
apathy. The organiser on that side is
not prepared to admit that his policy is so
rotten that it is not worth supporting at
the ballot box. He explains, therefore, in
effect, that, though Liberals look upon
Socialism as a curse; though they consider
that Labor is ruining the country; and
though they believe in Freetrade and indi-
vidualism and the Beef Trust and lower
wages, yet they are too languid to waste five .
minutes in voting to prevent ruin and to se-
cure instead the blessings just mentioned. That
is really what Liberal apathy means, though
the party is naturally unwilling to say it
in so many words. The Denham scheme, is
flawless as a means of collecting votes which
the party would otherwise lose, except
in one particular. No provision is made
for bringing the reluctant Liberal elector to
the polling-booth. Liberals who wouldn’t
vote the party ticket before, from conviction
and goodwill, are not going to do it now
from fear of a fine which many of them
would not miss. The obvious complement of
the Denham Government’s scheme is. a
fleet of Government motor-cars, lorries,
prison vans and omnibuses labelled “Lib-
erals only,” and driven by reliable Liberal
policemen. These vehicles should call at
Liberal houses, and if the inmates still
declined to come forth and support the glori-
ous principles of freedom of action and
thought, thev should be dragged out, pushed
on to the waiting conveyances, and not dis-
charged till they had done their respective
bits for Denham and Liberty. Meanwhile
it cannot be said that the DENHAM-ites. are
losing any chances in other directions.
Under the amended Electoral Act no elector
can be enrolled unless he can prove two
months’ residence in the district in which he
is seeking to vote. On the other hand, he
may be struck off the rolls of the constitu-
ency which he left about five minutes
previously. It is estimated that Labor will
lose a very useful vote of miners, shearers,
cane-cutters, navvies and nomads generally
under this arrangement. And then, there is
the Sixteen-question trick —a most ingenious
device. Each voter has to fill up a form
containing 16 pointless inquiries about him-
self and his past life. While this may be a
simple job for those who are used to cleri-
cal work, it is no doubt hoped that it will
prove otherwise to the average manual
toiler; and error invalidates the form. Alto-
gether, therefore, Parliamentary Liberalism
in Queensland is taking no needless risks of
defeat at the election. In fact, it is one of
the most determined triers, in the history of
the party movement or swindle.

Commonwealth Divorce Law.
The Federal Parliament will shortly con-
sider a Bill prepared by Attorney-General
Hughes for the rectification of those wrongs
from which every married person is a
potential sufferer, and by which “the purity
of the home,” so much discussed in wowser
circles, has been injuriously affected. Under
the time-dishonored system of one State one
divorce law, absurd differences and anom-
alies were established. What is ground for
divorce in Victoria is not ground for divorce
in N. S. Wales, while a marriage tie that
holds good in both of the older divisions of
the continent fails to bind an unwilling pair
of Westralians together. And even when
the divorce law of the State offers release
to an aggrieved wife or husband, the law of
domicile may prevent the would-be petitioner
from getting freedom, the other party being
elsewhere, and the expense of following the
absentee being prohibitive. Marriage in the
Commonwealth under existing conditions is
thus hardly more of a lottery than the
chance of being able to annul it. The pur-
pose of the Federal Divorce Bill, or what-
ever it is called, will be to abolish all unjust
differences between the laws of the different
States; and The Bulletin hopes that in
doing this the measure will also prove to be
as liberally designed as the present most
liberal State law. A fixed period of deser-
tion, without any question of other “immor-
ality” in the case, is already a sufficient
plea for a Victorian wife whose partner has
decamped. That ought to be made the
general law; no unreasonable difficulty as
regards domicile should ever prevent the
legal severance of two unloving persons who
have been practically severed for years.
Every wife or husband, in any part of the
Commonwealth, should, moreover, be en-
titled to the same liberty to get unshackled
from a habitual drunkard or hopeless luna-
tic, seeing that chronic inebriety and insanity
are disqualifications for healthy parentage
anyhow, and are equally incompatible with
happiness for the victim of such unholy
matrimony. It will be not sufficient for
Attorney-General Hughes’s Bill to estab-
lish a reasonable “one law one domicile”
principle. The law itself must be humane.
A wife or husband of a confirmed inmate
of an asylum is an uncertificated widow or
widower, and the law of the land ought to
be prepared to issue a certificate on appli-
cation.

The “Lowest Tender” Imbecility.
When the Otago (M.L.) Harbor Board
wanted a new tug it didn’t rush to the other
end of the world for one, but had the article
manufactured alongside the local water.
This was good sense and sound patriotism,
for the vessel which has. now materialised is
a first-rate machine, whose building kept
' many workmen employed. But some anony-
mous McTavisii, suffering from an overdose
of parritch, or something, was so wild at
seeing a locally-built steamer afloat that he
rushed off a furious letter, girding at the
Board for not having accepted the lowest
tender. Fortunately W. Belcher, who was
chairman of the Board when it closed the
deal with the Port Chalmers shipbuilders,
was waiting with a claymore, and decapi-
tated the dyspeptic McTavish with neat-
ness and despatch. Belcher showed (1)
that the lowest tender was from China;
(2) that the average British tender was
£23,226; (3) that the job was carried out
locally for £22,814. Having invited the
barracker who was yelling for the expendi-
ture of money in China instead of Dunedin
to come out and stand for election to the
Board, Belcher threw McTavish to the
ridicule of Scotia, and lay back to await
the next unpatriotic skinflint who might
want to have an argument. In having its
work done in Dunedin instead of in Hong-
kong or on the Clyde, not only did the
Board make a good bargain so far as imme-
diate results are concerned, but it did some-
thing towards getting future good bargains
by assisting the engineering workshops of
Maoriland to become something better than
mere repairing depots. An extraordinarily
large number of young Maorilanders take to
engineering. They are afloat to-day on
the seas of all the world. But in most cases
they have had to go to another country to
finish their training—mainly because the
country in which they were born, where
there are many technical schools, docks,
shipyards and ports visited by splendidly
equipped fleets of steam merchantmen,
hasn’t yet fully recognised the imbecility of
sending its dollars away to pay the wages
of workmen in other corners of the earth.

Mixing Misfortune and Crime.
No satisfactory distinction is made between
the different sorts of returned medical cases
among soldiers, while all are much too closely
associated with the disciplinary cases.
There is a prejudice, and for excellent rea-
sons, against sufferers from venereal disease.
There is an even stronger prejudice against
those who have been found unworthy to de-
fend their country—the army’s criminals. It
is surely an injustice that these people should
be associated in any way with well-behaved
ment who are back from the Front because
they have had the bad luck to be smitten with
pneumonia or rheumatism. And when it
comes to the names of all parties being pub-
lished in the press, the limit of injustice
would seem to be achieved. Here is the
story of a soldier invalid who was returned
from Egypt, at the end of last month, as
quoted by Matthews, M.P., in the Aus-
tralian Parliament
On arrival at Flinders-street Station we were re-
lieved of our kit-bags and marched to Army Service
Orderly-rooms, at rear of St. Kilda Barracks. Not
more than 100 yards in front of us was an escort
with fixed bayonets in charge of the disciplinary cases.
In rear of us there were two more of the armed
escort. This we objected to, as it made us appear in
the eyes of the public as undesirables.
Of course it did. The public is not an
analytical animal. It does not, when faced
by a newspaper list of returned soldiers,
store up in its mind the fact that, while
Brown was a disciplinary case of a
lamentable character, and Smith was a
sufferer from venereal disease, Bronson
was a splendid citizen and patriot, whose
one defect was a weakened lung. In fair-
ness to the good men who would be now
risking their lives if their constitutions per-
mitted, the authorities should see that the
public is made to understand which are the
moral wheat of our forces, and which
the tares. It is little enough recompense
to men who are as much heroes as those
who have died in action. Also there is
the material aspect of the case. It cannot
be a help to volunteering for men to know
that the catching of a bad cold may cause
them to be transported home —in a flam-
boyantly public manner —amidst a gang of
the nation’s outcasts.
Savings Bank Conveniences.
“Quidam”: When it is obviously necessary
for Governments to attract as much of the
public’s cash as possible, why not make some
alteration in the cumbrous and inconvenient
methods attaching to Savings Banks de-
posits and withdrawals? If some descrip-
tion of deposit slip and cheque system were
introduced, very few accounts belonging to
business people in a small way would go
anywhere else. Private banks charge nomin-
ally 10s. a year on current accounts —a
charge which, by reason of their generous
habit of collecting it also on closure of an
account, may easily be 15s. in the case of
people who move about at all. But if one
wants to deposit cash, the private bank sen-
sibly does not call for production of his pass-
book hy the person paying in the money,
neither does it call for production of his
pass-book before it will pay out. Deposit
slips and cheques serve for such transac-
tions, and the pass-book may be filled up any
old time, when the customer desires, and
when the bank employees have the time.
All the Savings Banks, on the contrary, call
for production of the pass-book before the
wheels will move. As one instance of the
way this acts against their interests, take the
case of a depositor who left Victoria for
N. S. Wales a few months ago and sold a
small property on time payment. Both the
vendor and the purchaser were agreeable to
the purchaser banking the payments to the
vendor’s account in the local Savings Bank;
but, on inquiry, it was shown that such pay-
ments could only be made if the vendor’s
bank-book were left in the purchaser’s hands,
a procedure fraught with too many openings
for future trouble. Consequently, a private
firm scoops 5 per cent, for receiving and for-
warding. It may be urged that a less archaic
system would entail more work for Savings
Bank officials; but some of them, at any
rate, state very emphatically that the reverse
would be the case, and that cheques and de-
posit slips that can be entered up in the books
whether the doors are open or not are very
much better for the staff than a system which
entails the presence of the customer and his
pass-book at one and the same time. But
whatever the effect on the staff, a practical
reform would lead to a large amount of cash
being lent to the State at low interest, instead
of being handed to private institutions which
make an irritating charge for keeping it.
Invitations to go Browsing in the Moon.
If the Triennial Labor Conference, to be held
at Adelaide at the end of this month, accepts
only half the proposals offered for the I ight-
ing Platform, the latter will be a copious
pulpit. Here are a few of the planks some ot
the branches would like to see inserted:
Pensions to widows ; larger old-age pensions, to be
paid on reaching 60; national control of the wheat,
market [no details] ; House of Representatives and
Senate to sit and vote as one on all occasions; a
wealth tax on incomes over £1000; a referendum as
to abolishing State Governors ; the wisdom of settling
international disputes by a council of civilised
nations [civilised nations unspecified] ; the abolition
of the Senate; ditto the tipping system [no details,
as usual] ; High Court to be deprived of its powers
of interpreting the Constitution; nationalisation of
the medical and nursing professions, the, hospitals
and the manufacture, importation and sale of drugs ;
Federal members to hand to the party funds from 2$
to 15 per cent, of their salaries; teetotalism to
be absolute with all Parliamentary candidates; social-
isation of the means of production and distribution
of foodstuffs —and goodness knows what else.
And while various branches have made these
and many other proposals, not one has said
a word about making a serious attempt, with
the party’s assured majority in both Houses,
to carry out the existing planks in the plat-
form, particularly the one demanding ad-
equate Protection —not the revenue-produc-
ing hypocrisy introduced in December.
Effective Protection and the initiative and
referendum were among the things promised
by Labor at last election. The party was
given a double majority, so that it might
fulfil those promises. Now then, when is it
going to get to work v
B. li. Wise will make a useful Agent-
General for N. S. Wales. He knows his
subject from A to Z. He has written a
standard book about Australia; and there
are few places or personalities in the Eastern
States that he is unacquainted with. He
is persona grata with officialdom in London,
and he can make the sort of speeches that
London likes and understands. But his
best work \yill be done in connection with
the Tory yarns about the dangerous madness
of our Labor legislation. It is Australia’s
misfortune that 95 per cent, of visitors from
the Commonwealth shout these slanders all
over the United Kingdom, in part because
they believe them, in part because they think
that moneyed Britishers expect something of
the sort. No one is better fitted than
Wise, both by long experience and capacity,
to deal with these lies ; and the moment the
war is over they will be going as strong as
ever.
.+
Mr. Anderson’s report on the business
management of the naval and military offices
was worth having, if only to recall to the
Australian Parliament that . the apothegm
about the bootmaker and his last applies
with equal force to (he soldier as to the
cobbler, and takes in the sailor as well.
The essence of what the Commissioner has
to say is that it is the business of military
men to train themselves and others for
war; of business men to attend to the busi-
ness side of the game. Put a soldier to drill
troops, to lead them, to work out a plan of
campaign, to defend or take a position, then
the soldier is doing something for which
he has special qualifications, and which only
a soldier can undertake with reasonable
chances of success. Set him down in the
market place to buy 50,000 sacks of oats,
a fleet of motor-cars, a waggon load
of boots or a few million feet of
timber, then will he nine times out of 10
make a mess of the thing—and the measure
of the muddle will, as a rule, be his effi-
ciency in his own special field; for the
better soldier he is the worse business man
is he liable to be. For the navy the nation
needs men who can handle ships and work
guns, and the men who do these things are
not the men who should purchase pickled
pork and vegetables. And because the
soldier and the sailor have been attending
to the pickled pork and pumpkins. Ander-
son found something like chaos had already
developed. In one department “stock had
not been taken for years.” In another he
discovered a vast accumulation of futility.
That no sign of anything immoral was
detected is, of course, a matter for thank-
fulness. But much more than that is neces-
sary in the interests of the_ taxpayers’
pocket and effective administration.

John Livingstone, M.H.R. for Barker
(S.A.), and one of S. Australia’s best-
known authorities on stock and stock-rais-
ing, gave the Northern Territory a _ char-
acter in the House the o'ther day. Said he:
It is idle to suggest that the Territory is not
good country. We are in possession of reliable re-
ports that land in the Macdonnell Ranges and
Barkly Tablelands would carry 20,000,000 sheep, and
that there are 80,000,000 acres of the best wheat-
growing country in the world, with a rainfall of 16
inches....lt is a magnificent country for the raising
of horses and cattle.
Livingstone urged a vigorous policy of
railway construction —the direct north-and-
south line, with branches principally into
Westralia. Not long ago in London he met
Kitchener, who expressed his “delight”
that the Commonwealth Parliament pro-
posed to construct the line from Oodnadatta
to Pine Creek. That scheme, however,
doesn’t suit the back-yard politicians who
want to run a sort of switchback round
Queensland coast towns. But probably
Kitchener wasn’t thinking about how
they could hang on to their seats. The
chances are he was merely thinking about
how the Empire could hang on to Australia.
♦ •
“Alamon,” who lives on the spot, thinks
something else is wanted; —
So the Government is going to nationalise the hotels
up here in the Territory. There are not many—three
in Darwin, one each at Brock’s Creek, Pine Creek,
Katherine, Booroloola and Alice Springs; perhaps one
or two others. Advocates of the measure appear to
claim that nationalising the pubs will do away with
doctored booze and sly-grog selling. Well, I doubt it,
unless something else is done first and with a hard
hand. Practically every Chinese humpy in the Terri-
tory is a sly-grog shop and opium-joint. And a large
number of white men run unlicensed groggeries. It
is there that doping goes on. The “paralyzers” that
niggers buy would stiffen out an emu. Yet it is
seldom one hears of a conviction for sly-grog selling,
and more seldom still of an offender gaoled. It is
these hells that want stamping out. The hotels are
harmless compared with them.
Which is, of course, uot an argument against
the State doing something new, but an

From the Dardanelles, where Australasia’s

±epe—the silent boat-journey by dark; the
disembarkation under a withering fire: the
ascent of the cliffs; and, later, the grim
work with bayonet and rifle on the shrapnel-
swept plateau—makes a stirring story. It
thrilled Australia with admiration for her
soldier sons, and with pride that they had
so nobly justified the confidence of their
home. The Turk has never been found a
mean opponent, and Constantinonle is a
long way from Gaba Tepe. But whether a
passage, is at last hacked through or not
Australia knows that her men will have
fought gallantly and well. Than that they
can do no more. The casualty lists are
mounting up. This draining away of what
the country can least afford to give is agon-
ising, but inevitable. It can only be ended
by keeping up the pressure on the -enemy.

Ihe interval between a harbor excursion
and a banquet was spent by delegates to
tne I rentiers picnic in discussing Fisher's
strategic railway; and after expressing the
opinion that Andrew didn’t seem to know
much about it, and that they themselves
knew rather less, a strategic resolution was
solemnly recorded. The point of it was
that the Commonwealth Government should
nist determine the tactical object it wished
to achieve, and then find out from the rail-
vaj experts how this could best be effected.
But the Government already has a report
rrom its Kailway War Council, emphasising
the need to increase the efficiency of exist-
ing railway systems. From this the only
dissentient was the military member of the

tor rambling, irrelevant reasons, the Port

to stay at Sydney Royal for some weeks
yet and act as a standing advertisement for
the imbecility of the best German spies. The
Iron Cross joke gets a good laugh nightly,
ai \d the diplomatist never fails to work the
old trick of exchanging an empty revolver
f Ol L a full one. It never seems to strike the
baffled villain to kick his hated opponent in
the vest. Or perhaps the dramatist doesn’t
allow him to think. A thinking villain would
ruin the best melodrama.

Allen Doone made his peace with the
bhoys and the colleens on Saturday night at
the Palace when he cut out his dissipation
with the “Too Much Johnson” brand and
went back to “The Parish Priest.” Och,
the foine stuff it samed after that lager-beer
slush from the Bowery! The satisfaction
ot the co. in having work it understood
and liked resulted in the best revival of the
Insh piay in Sydney. On Saturday, “In

exhausted its vocabulary on the lady when
she was here before, and it can’t repeat it-

only two more nights to run; he is another

the week he is to draw £75, and the Belgian

. “Broadway Jones” at Melbourne Royal
is still carrying on the chewing-gum factory
where his ancestors Defore him were so
much to blame. Also the wildly flirtatious
widow continues to confer a sham title upon

“THE TROJAN WOMEN.”
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Nerve us, ye gods, with calmness to recall
A show in Melbourne’s Athenaeum Hall.
Lo! Troy in ruins lay—a world of desolation
McMahon offered to imagination ;
The fallen city, shaped of hanging serges,
That hid the strains of dingy, dismal dirges,
Wrought by the brains of brother Marshall Hall —-
Oh, woe was us!
Whilst Hall —a Von professor at his side —•
Sat in the second row and nursed his pride,
Poor Hecuba, dead Priam’s hapless queen,
Talked by the yard of what she once had been";
Of bygone comforts and of former blisses,
And wrongs in store; for now the great Ulysses
Claimed the old lady for his thrall, or missus.
Oh, woe was us!
“THE MAN WHO STAYED AT
HOME” SYDNEY ROYAL.
German spy Sanderson (Cyril Mackay) is
eulogised by his ma.
The voice of Hecuba from time to time stood still.
It stopped to rest. Then others on the bill
Proclaimed their sufferings; out of fair Trojan heads
Sprang warm remarks re bridegrooms, brides and
beds,
And captive charms and ruthless captors’ arms,
Affronted modesty and virginal alarms,
Etcetera.
Oh, woe was us !
Cassandra took the floor, waving a torch around,
Grown frantic, like Ophelia, through her grief pro-
found.
She, being booked for Agamemnon’s bride,
Dropped lurid hints of death and suicide,
And Hecuba, her mother, talked some more
Of grief and pain, and cruel Greeks and gore.
Thus crawled sad Time along till sweet Andromache
(Softer of speech than all the rest was she)
Brought in her offspring, Hector’s only child,
Whose fate from weepful Hecuba fresh tears beguiled.
Oh, luckless little one!
Behind the dingy, sergey screen of Troy
Fiends flung to death that plump and pleasing boy,
And on a shield his breathing’ corpse was laid
In front of Hecuba.
Then burst the present writer’s mighty heart,
For, with his programme muflling snorts of pain,
He thought about the Germans at Louvain,
And saw the import of the play revealed,
And drew conclusions.
The modern Hun, that bogus vengeance wreaks
On all the helpless, acts just like the Greeks—
The Greeks whom crank professors all adore
Who stood for Eultur in dark days of yore - ’
Whose gods were beautiful, whose creed of hate
Comes easy to the Schweinhunds up to date
What the Greek heroes of M. Hall have done
In ages past now doth the busy Hun.
Hence the production of his deadly show,
Which made apologies for Britain’s glorious foe.'
And Marshall Hall and his distinguished Teutonic-
colleague, Edward Scharfe, sat and listened to
the moral lesson in the second row.
Oh, woe was us 1

and two festive babies are stated to be
features of commanding importance. Mean-
while “From Convent to Throne” continues

Sterzelly and his dawg are useful additions
to the Tivoli bill in Melbourne. The small

its boss a bottle of beer and smoking a cigar.
Also “Lucky” bursts into song of a sort, and
goes through a form of saying prayers —which
is as far as men go as a rule. A trio of
graceful equilibrists are other new arrivals,
and the turn of Mozart introduces that hard

At Melbourne Bijou this week the Blet-
soe party of comedians are occupying the
second half of the programme in a musical
comedy sketch entitled “Fun in the Sana-
torium.” The fun is largely of a rough,
knockabout order, but two or three of the
gents, are threatened with humor, while Miss
Maud Bletsoe reveals a warble of very
passable quality. Tozart, a new vagabond
artist, is an exuberant producer of pot-
boiler landscapes; and Carrie Moore is
trying to achieve recognition as an intense
reciter in the popular pome, “Woman’s
Eyes.” Gwaxy, the violinist, is still pains-
taking. He fiddles even ragtime as if it
were composed by Paganini.

in “Belgian peasant costume” of a presum-
ably ornate character.
The King’s (Melb.), which has lately
been out of business, reopens on Saturday
with a show of war films in colors. Ten
thousand feet of pictures are alleged to
expose Europe at war, and some patriotic
songsters, also a military band, will keep
the audience’s ears occupied whilst its eyes
are resting.

At the King’s, “80-peep” displaces “Mother

"THE TROJAN
WOMEN."
The god Poseidon dis-
cussing things in general.
From an Adelaide critic: —
The Society of Arts exhibitors at the annual show
were gently reproached by Sowden (president of the
State Gallery) for the absence of kangaroo, emu and
wattle, of sculpture and modelling, and of anything
with an historical interest. With these limitations
the 1915 exhibition is a good one, though the really
striking work comes from fewer hands than usual.
Hayley Lever (who has won the Carnegie gold medal)
is away, and Heysen is busy, as usual; but Will
Ashton has a bunch of pictures, not large, but highly
characteristic, of river scenes in Paris, with varia-
tions in Holland, Scotland and Italy. Marie Tuck,
who specialises in the figure-compositions that so
many others shy away from, has a lot of them. The
big figures, crammed in small frames f with little
margin, are hardly attractive, but they are powerful,
and they dominate this year’s show. Most of her
subjects are French; but an ambitious three-fold
mirror study in which the flesh painting is weak
might come from anywhere. James Ashton, president
of the society, paints his seascapes on the small
scale this year. He and son Will, who as a rule
need not sign their work, have amused themselves
by assuming a sort of disguise in one canvas each.
James actually paints a house among the trees, and
Will a girl at a piano. Gwen Barringer continues
to do fine gum-trees in the Heysen manner, and
Edward Davies (steadily improving) in a Heysen plus
Davies manner. Gustave Barnes is marking-time for
the present, but one or two of his things show a
sense of romance which is mostly lacking else-
where.
Professor Tom Lyle, has just retired from
the Melbourne University, where he .sat in
the Chair of Natural Philosophy for 26
years. He intends prosecuting
work. He is a big, soft-eyed, kind Irishman,
a graduate of T.D.C., and a great authority
on cricket. Unfortunately he injured his
knee at the game and walks with a crutch.
His wife is a daughter of a wealthy Aus-
tralian squatting family; hence, no doubt,
the unsalaried research work.
During the Maoriland elections in Decem-
ber Premier Bill Massey had a. commission
at work allegedly to “fix the price of food.
Wheat was being imported from Canada
and sold to millers at a loss to the State of
6d. a bushel on some vague condition that
they wouldn’t charge more than a certain
price for the flour. The bluff went through.
But when the elections were over prices
generally took the lift and have not. come
down yet; the millers are still grinding
Massey’s wheat, but the price of flour is up
to £lB a ton. Meanwhile the benevolent
Massey threatens a war tax “to fall on
everyone,” his brown majority of one grins
affably all round, and Fat newspapers are
truculently demanding to know what more
anyone wants? Naturally, of course, the
public, being full up, says it doesn’t want
any more.

“Binnacle”; The statement (B. 6/5/’l5)
about steamship owners making fat divi-
dends through the war is a generalisation
not wholly just. The Admiralty has pub-
lished the tonnage rate it will pay for all
steamships commandeered for Government
service. Many owners say it doesn’t pay
them to be commandeered. Obviously,
with the present demand for tonnage
and big freights it is a disadvantage
—as far as Australia, anyway, is
concerned. Many owners lean see their
trade ruined for the want of tonnage to keep
it going. Depreciation is a big item. One
of the best-equipped floating palaces was
in Sydney on her maiden voyage six months
ago. The skipper was on a couple of days’
furlough, and when he returned he learned
that his ship was at Cockatoo. Chasing
her thither he found her in the possession of
hundreds of workmen busily employed in
cutting her saloons. Whereat he sat down
on the deck and cried.
“Rosna” (London) : A real Y.C. appeared
for a few days in the Military Pageant now
running at the Coliseum. He was brought
on to share the glory with Britannia in the
finale, his name being first blazoned on the
screen; and the modest fellow was then
found to be also the possessor of the Medal
Militaire. His fellow mummers treated him
royally, a famous actor-manager invited
him to his place in the country for the week-
end, and requests were made to the local
mayor to have a little demonstration in his
honor. It lasted five days; then the police
arrived and heartlessly arrested the heroic
youth as a deserter who had never been to
the Front, and had bought his medals from
curio shops for sums varying from 7s. 6d.
to 30s.
AT POVERTY POINT.
Nelson Illingworth conducting operatic excerpts
at the Repertory Theatre , Sydney.
“Busk” : I could not well account for Mrs.
Bernard Beere’s success. She had magnet-
ism, that’s about the size of it —an indefinable
quality of her own, like Bernhardt, deny,
Duse or Mrs. Campbell. You may puzzle
why she caught on better even than Ada
Ward. Hers was a sloppy kind of face,
half-shut little eyes without. expression, and
the general lazy style of a big woman. But
she had a loving, languorous, lapping voice,
wrapping one in velvet. Her company m
Australia included that model of a woman,
Miss Urquhart, with Stuart, Standing,
Marius and Cathcart. Standing was deposed
from leading man, and replaced by Otho
Stuart, through a disgraceful fiasco in
“Fedora,” in Melbourne. He first went on
the boards as Herbert Crellin, but changed
to Standing through being respondent in a
divorce case. He had married the divorced
Florence St. John. So they go round and
round.
“Norbell”: Mrs. Bernard Beere’s death
recalls a story she used to tell of her first
appearance as Fedora in Melbourne. She
brought a raw Irish girl with her as
dresser, and the colleen soon recognised the
popularity of the Australian adjective.
Fedora, in evening dress during the first
act, told Kathleen to stand by with a warm
wrap the moment the curtain fell, as it was
wintry weather. She explained that _ the
curtain cue was “Vladimir dead! Vladimir
dead!” “Now, Kathleen,” said the star,
“you’re quite sure you understand?”_ “In-
dade I do, mum,” she answered, “depind on
me. I’ll be there wid yer fur coat the minit
yell shout ‘Blanky near dead! Blanky near
dead !’ ”
Julius Knight, having bidden farewell to
the cities, is already adjusting his swag for
his backblocks’ tour. The amazed inhabi-
tants of the hamlets between Tamworth and
Rockhampton will soon see this last of the
sundowners arrive at their sliprails, with
his company of 50, and with “The Royal
Divorce,” “The Lady of Lyons” and “David
Garrick” packed in his bluey. As Julius
has played in country towns where the old-
est inhabitants absolutely refused to believe
that the hero was Knight, and insisted that
it was probably ano. ar mummer _ of the
same stage name, he i. ;s given this office
his word that he, and not his understudy,
will be Napoleon, and that Miss Nellie
Bramley will be his Josephine. His first
camp will be at Tamworth on May 26.
“Norbell”: “Confusion” was certainly
Rignold’s property, but he did not appear
in it himself until several others had had a
go at the lead. The first —and best —Mor-
timer was Phil Day. Bob Inman was next.
Years afterwards Inman was on tour in
Rignold’s co., and must have hated to see
“Confusion” go up. Rignold was always
undecided whether he would himself play,
and Inman was his standby. In Bendigo
Inman, being told that the old man would
play Mortimer, packed up and was getting
ready for a quiet evening, when a messenger
arrived, hot foot, to tell him he had to go
on after all. Inman rushed round to the
theatre, unpacked his Saratoga, and was
made-up and ready as the orchestra started.
Then George strolled in. “Ah! Inman, you
may have a night off; there’s a good house,
so I think I’ll juggle Mortimer myself!”
The “comic” feature of a Savage Club
concert at Melbourne Town Hall last week
was an “ ’Ymn of ’Ate” parody on that
German dirge which is training up the Hun
kiddies in the way they should think.
Horace Stevens, disguised as a tall and tei-
rible Kaiser Bill, stalked on to the platfoim
with a party of five military scarecrows ot
whom musician Zelman and jeweller New-
man were the most active comedians. J-Jic
Kaiser soloed and the others chorused, and
the incidental fooling was quite up to the
musical comedy standard of humor, the crowd
being finally dispersed by an infant sailor
who marched from the back of the hall
whilst the orchestra played “Rule Britan-
nia.” The joke was cleverly enough con-
structed ; but seeing that the Australian
boys are falling in a sphere of action where
Germany is not chiefly concerned, the whole
thing seemed rather out of place and gave
the audience a pain in its reflections.
“0.P.”: Perth West Australian inter-
viewed Walenn, of the worst Gilbert and
Sullivan company that has yet entered the
Pacific, and the “interview” was a great
example of lunatic press agency. Mr.
Walenn is “a young man with a vivid and
serious imagination,” but the statement ol
his youth doesn’t fit the claim that he played
under Gilbert. He explains a small Koko
with the statement that “Gilbert had in
mind” men small of stature for these parts.
Now, Grossmith wasn’t a small, round sort
of comedian, but a grave joker who, like
Howard Vernon —probably the best Gil-
bertian artist on earth —gave the Gilbertian
humor the true interpretation by doing
ridiculous things seriously. For this reason
Walenn’s statement that these plays # come
to Australia in a new aspect”—-which is
unfortunately true —“and just as Gilbert had
chosen they should go forth to the public
as his own personal conceptions” cuts no
ice. And it is not true that the operas
are being staged “without any local or
interpolated gags, but just as Gilbert wrote
them.” Gilbert didn’t write any sacks-on-
the-mill buffoonery for Koko, Pooh Bah and
Pitti Sing when the Mikado is talking of
boiling oil; nor did Sullivan write vaude-
ville variations into “Titwillow.” If the
public likes G. and S. plays done with the
red-nose and slap-stick of panto., good
enough; but it is long over the odds to
charge the buffoonery to the cleanest and
happiest collaboration on record.
Hugh D. Mclntosh’s new theatre at Bris-
bane is the only one in Australasia where two
shows can be run simultaneously. Above
the ordinary theatre is a roof-garden theatre,
and the Mclnsplosh charges it with being
the finest in the world. The main show-shop
will seat 1800 people, and the one top-side
1200. Saturday, May 15, will go down in
history as the opening date.
Charles Frohman, who was one of
the murdered passengers by the Lusi-
tania, was born at Sandusky, Ohio
(USA.), in 1860, commenced working
life as a clerk in the N.Y. Tribune oflice,
and was subsequently on the N.Y r . Graphic.
His first connection with theatres was in the
box-office at Hooley’s, Brooklyn. Then he
joined Haverley’s Minstrels as business-
manager, and took them to London. Next
he was assistant-manager of the Madison
Square Theatre; subsequently became
dramatic agent, and toured with several
plays ; and then began to get hold of theatres
on both sides of “the pond”—among them
the Empire, Criterion and Garrick Theatres,
in N’York, and the Duke of York’s and Globe
in London.
“Masetto”: The Old Enemy has just
claimed three noted musicians—Bernard
Stavenhagen, at one time the most favored of
piano teachers; Waldteufel, the great waltz
composer, whose melodious tunes were once
played in every ballroom; and Ernest de
Munck, the ’cellist, who was close on 80.
Munck in 1880 toured Australia with his
wife, Carlotta Patti, sister of Adelina. Car-
lotta, who died about 25 years ago, had a
superb voice, but was hampered in appear-
ance by lameness. On that account she
always stood at the side of the platform when
singing. De Munck was the best exponent of
his instrument who had visited these parts
till then; but the public treated him as it
did the incomparable Gerardy, and stopped
away.
“Billy Williams,” the Australian comedian
and vocalist who recently passed out in
London after making a big name in the halls
and the gramophone “parlors,” was Billy
Banks when he was a kid. A brother was
Dick Banks, well known as a professional
golfer. Billy’s start was made at small halls
in Melbourne.
“Screen” : The Living Pictures shown in
Melbourne, and taken from the German side,
by the Kaiser’s order, for the U.S.A., are
remarkable. Generals Joffre and French
have not allowed any such intimate reports
from the Allied side. It is understood that
Asquith is for publicity, but Poincare with-
stands it. The most striking picture is of
actual battle. The opposing lines are only
about half a mile apart, and both are busy
firing. Specially graphic is a charge into
battle by Bavarian cavalry, who are shown
crossing a road with a difficult bank. The
Kaiser is seen quite close, reviewing troops
as they pass to fight.' Next we are inside
batteries of the artillery firing line. Then
off to Berlin, to join an overwhelming
crowd at a funeral of German officers. I
hope the cinematographer is with the Aus-
tralians at the Dardanelles. Unquestionably
he is if the G.O.C. will give him standing
room..

WAR AND ART.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Before my feet the vision stretched
Of Europe in her agony,
Each poignant detail sharply etched;
I knew her stress from sea to sea.
And through the smoke the endless drone
Of dying men was eastward blown.
One figure saw I, queenly fair,
That fluttered in the murky haze—
A woman slight, with storm-blown hair,
And woe in her uplifted gaze,
Who raised her hands to Heaven's gate •«
In passion inarticulate.
Like some frail object on a sea
By tempest torn she rose and fell.
’Twas gentle Art, and vainly she
Her noble message strove to tell —-
To make her voice heard in. the roar
And babel of incessant war.

Pressmen have queer experiences in their

scurvy trick on one at Auckland recently.
A fatal lift accident happening in a city
building, he hurried to the scene to get a
first-hand story of the happening. There
was no copy for him that time— nothing
but a heart-breaking tragedy, for the young
woman who had met instant death was the

The toughest job that has come the way
of a trustee this year is harassing the
executors of Michael Shiel. Michael died
at St. Hilda (Vic.) in 1904, leaving a Me
interest in his estate to the widow. Ihe
will directed that on her death —which event
did not take place until last year —the pro-
perty should be converted into cash, and the
proceeds paid to the persons to wliom he
owed money at the time he once filed ins
schedule at Melbourne. If the people them-
selves were not living, then his executors
were to dig up their children or other suc-
cessors in title. That on the face of it
looked as though it might be a tough pro-
position ; but when it turned out that the
poor old man’s schedule was filed 52 years
ago, those executors felt as though Chaos as
well as the Kaiser had broken loose.
The Berlin officials have explained why
the German submarine permitted the
Falaba’s passengers to drown whilst crying
to their murderers for rescue. “The sub-
marine,” says the apologist, “was forced to
withdraw quickly on account of the ap-
proach of other vessels. It had to be pru-
dent owing to the malicious and hostile
attitude of British merchantmen towards the
German submarines.” That takes the saus-
age even from the Huns’ excuse that the
Belgians were murdered because they were
not amiable to the Kaiser’s _ brave soldiers.
The submarines are out to sink all the ves-
sels they can see and are not afraid to at-
tack ; yet the humorless Hog Government
talks of “the malicious and hostile attitude
of British merchantmen” —the malice and
hostile attitude of a cargo steamer towards
the pirate vessel that is seeking its destruc-
tion ! This is worse than the wickedness of
the Belgians for feeling unfriendly to the
gory burglars within their _ gates. Let _ the
world understand that malice and hostility
are German prerogatives !

The inquiry concerning the Victorian re-
formatory ship John Murray has so far only
served to emphasise the futility of the whole
outfit, from the time the vessel was bought
at an exorbitant price up to the present.
Evidence has been dumped in by the bushel —
that of the quaint steward who spent most
of his time making notes in a diary ; of the
schoolmaster who kept school two hours a
day four days a week; of the master-at-arms
who was largely ornamental; of the secre-
tary whose accounts were never audited; of
dozens of others, including the boy who was
rope-ended and had to be operated on in
hospital in consequence. But no solitary
witness has so far explained what the blessed
ship is for, or what useful purpose it serves.
Even the cook —the most important person
on a well-regulated ship —seems to have been
a joke. None of the boys knew his name,
but he was called “Flossie,” and spent
most of his time consulting a cookery book,
and is the only bright gleam in a murky
business.

Among the Huns who have been placed
under arrest in N. S. Wales on suspicion of
being disaffected persons there was one
who felt so wild about it last week that he
rushed the Supreme Court with an applica-
tion for a writ of habeas corpus to compel
the Crown to yield up his body to his own
custody, on the ground that he was a good
Australian, born at Randwick. Counsel hav-
ing been heard for the applicant who desired
to get control of himself, the opposing Wig
quietly arose and read several letters written
by the good Australian to his father and
others in Germany. These set out that he
was suffering the most acute mental agony
at having to be “in foreign parts” while
brother Huns were cutting the foe into
mincemeat; that he thought of making a bolt
for the Rhine via America; and that even
if this didn’t come off, he was consumed with
overwhelming desires to get busy with gun
and bayonet. Thereupon the Court looked
interrogatively in the direction of the Wig
who had the grievance in hand, and, on being
told that the towel was in, said it was just
as well, wrote a large “No” over the docu-
ments, and left the body o£ the most excellent
Australian in the custody of a uniform.
It is remarked in Britain these times that
the local birds get quicker news of the war
than the humans. Some ground birds, such
as pheasants, can hear a battle in the North
Sea or a heavy bombardment in Belgium.
Others of the high-flying sort can see it from
almost as great a distance. When they hear
something happening they fly aloft to see
what all the row’s about. Mostly the hus-
band skylark, after a look round, comes
back to tell his wife on the nest that the
Germans are at their gas-poisoning tricks
again.

These three verses, taken from the Vital
Issue —a New York weekly paper which
stands for “Principles, Ideals, _ Honor and
Justice” —are typical of the bitterly anti-
British literature which the U.S.A. allow
to be circulated :
THE BRITISH THIEF.
Unmasked upon the land and sea
The Isle of Thieves her flag unfurled ;
“War on the trade of Germany,’’
Her hucksters bellowed through the world.
Her “cause,” her battle-cry in war—-
The longing in her tainted heart—-
Her navy’s great new Trafalgar
To filch a fettered nation’s mart!
But British greed and food-blockade
Are vain to sate her lust for gains ;
For ere she capture German trade
She must develop German brains.
Every mail, along with stones of such stuff,
there come dozens of letters begging Aus-
tralia to remember that the great heart of
the United States beats for us. For that
we are truly grateful. If it didn’t, the
United States press would probably be per-
mitted to say something quite unpleasant
about us.
One of the remarkable features of the
war is Berlin’s habit of rejoicing. Prior to
the war the German was looked upon as an
unusually phlegmatic person. Nobody ex-
pected him to do handsprings or decorate

‘Bookware” on some people who camped
there before Billjim :
The first recorded date in Egypt’s history is 4241
b.c., which is also the first recorded in the world’s
history. Abraham’s arrival in Egypt was not earlier
o-an 2000 B.c. Joseph’s Pharaoh was probably of
the Eighteenth Dynasty, 1540-1315 b.c. The date of
the Sphinx is placed at about 2800 b.c ; of the Great
Pyramid at about 2850 b.c. Twenty-five centuries
before Christ Egypt had already a thousand years of
splendid national life behind her. The dynasties
were first recorded, so far as known, by Manetho, a
priest, about 263 b.c. His work is the basis of all
subsequent inquiry. A few names of monarchs tower
majestically over the oblivious sands of 3000 years
tka t stretch between Menes and Alexander’s conquest,
332 b.c. Such are Cheops, builder of the Great
Pyramid ; three kings named Sesostris ; Rameses 11.,
chief builder of Thebes, with its hundred gates, anc
mighty Thothmes 111., conqueror of Asia. He ruled
from 1501-1447 b.c. One of his obelisks is on
Thames Embankment; another in Central Park, New
York; a third in front of the Lateran, Rome. The
decline of Egypt began long before Alexander. The
dominations have been Ethiopian, Assyrian, Persian,
Greek, Roman, Arabian, Turkish, French and English,
How about an obelisk for Australia? Or oese
fact that Sydney has a central sewer shaft constructed
t resemble Cleopatra’s Needle kill the idea?

FEATHERS IN HIS HAT.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Before this cursed war began,
Punk was a decent plain-c lothes man ;
But, at the first of war's alarms,
Punk, like a patriot, flew to arms.
The arms to which Punk nobly flew
Could never be described as new.
Old rifles, long discarded, came
And set Punk’s patriot heart aflame.
Then, to the side-drum’s rub-a-dub,
He marched with his brave rifle club.
He drilled by artificial light,
The German dastards to affright.
But if of Punk the Emperor heard,
He never said a blessed word.
Then Punk, to further cow the foe,
Got into clothes the shade of dough.
Such clothes all but the brave would shirk;
But they were built for Desperate Work.
And Punk, I’ve reason to suppose,
Was just as desperate as his clothes.
When on parade, Punk and his crew
Looked just as working convicts do.
But Punk and all the other bloods
Were proud of their depressing duds.
They marched and wheeled, they even charged,
And on their martial deeds enlarged.
They crawled and rushed o’er vacant lots,
And thought of corpses, pools and clots.
In fact, they had a splendid game
That set their minds and hearts aflame.
But little boys, whose sports they’d spoiled,
Looked on and guyed them till they boiled.
Yells of command hung in the air,
And men played soldiers everywhere.
A private fifteen weeks ago,
Punk’s a lieutenant now, you know.
He studied drill like fury, and
He issues now each sharp command.
Last night, at a tremendous bat,
He passed with feathers in his hat.
And someone said, as if quite vexed,
“He’ll have ’em in his coat-tails next!”
“And then,” said someone else, “he’ll be
As fine a rooster as you’ll see!”

ACID STOMACHS ARE DANGEROUS.
COMMON SENSE ADVICE BY A
DISTINGUISHED SPECIALIST.
“Acid” stomachs are dangerous because
acid irritates and inflames the delicate lining
of the stomach, thus hindering and prevent-
ing the proper action of the stomach, and
leading to nine-tenths of the cases of
stomach trouble from which people suffer.
Medicines and medicinal treatments are use-
less in such cases, for they leave the source
of the trouble, the acid in the stomach , as
dangerous as ever. The acid must be neu-
tralised, and its formation prevented, and
the best thing for this purpose is half a tea-
spoonful of bisurated magnesia, a simple
antacid, taken in a little warm or cold
water after eating, which not only neu-
tralises the acid, but also prevents the fer-
mentation from which acidity is developed.
Foods which ordinarily cause greatest dis-
tress can be eaten with impunity if the meal
is followed with a little bisurated magnesia,
which can be obtained of any chemist, and
should always be kept handy.*

Justice Higgins, vice-president of ■ the
Peace Society of Victoria, has just re-
turned from foreign parts with the same
“judicial” ideas concerning “patriotism”
that he took away with him. Said his
Honor to an interviewer at Fremantle: —
Personally I am unable to see what else we could
have clone but fight. I quite concede that at the
root of war are greed and national vanity, which is
mere extension of personal vanity so often miscalled
patriotism ; and I am prepared to assume that our
people are as much affected by greed and personal
vanity as the Germans. But what was the British
Government to do ? The utterances of German states-
men and leaders of thought showed conclusively that
they conceded it to be the destiny of Germany to
dominate the world, and to that end to bring the
British Empire to heel, and for that purpose to kill
as many men and massacre as many women and chil-
dren as they might find expedient.
According, then, to the vice-president of the
Vic. Peace Society, any community that
goes to war is actuated by greed and
national vanity. Then thank Heaven for
greed and national vanity; for if those
things were a German monopoly, plainly
Germany would soon rule the world.

Douglas Mawson came back from the
United States last week to say “How d’ye
do?” to a new daughter, aged a fortnight,
and tell us that 100 per cent, of the navy
and 100 per cent, of the army and 90 per
cent, of the people of the U.S.A. were pro.-
British. With the Antarctic explorer came
a letter for The Bulletin from an Austra-
lian resident in the States which, while it
throws a lot of suspicion on the explorer’s
figures, throws a lot of light also on the
IJ.S. attitude:—
Americans are a bit sore at the way their neutrality
is being received, since of all neutral nations they
consider that their position is the most delicate, the
most difficult and the most dangerous, for it need
hardly be pointed out that for this country to come
out flat-footed for one side or the other would mean
civil war.
But ex-President Roosevelt, at any rate,
knows that that is not the point. It isn’t
a question of the United States coming out
flat-footed for one side or the other. It is
merely a question whether the United States
can sign Conventions guaranteeing the in-
tegrity of neutral countries like Belgium, and
then permit the “scraps of paper” to be torn
up and flung in the face of the President and
the people. If Americans feel “a bit sore
at the way their neutrality is being re-
ceived,” how do they reckon Belgium should
feel?

The Bulletin has received a memo, from
the “Citizens’ Protest Committee against
Compulsory Vaccination,” intimating that “a
Victorian Parliamentary Committee will be
visiting Sydney this week to take evidence
as to the advisabilty of repealing the compul-

sory vaccination law of Victoria.” “If any
Bulletin readers know anyone who has suf-
fered injurious effects of vaccination,” the
committee implores them to come forth.
Also, on its own account The Bulletin
invites those who are not dead from the
small-pox which they probably would have
contracted if they hadn’t been vaccinated to
likewise come forth. Further, it suggests that
those who have died from small-pox which
they almost assuredly wouldn’t have con-
tracted had they been vaccinated might
stretch a point and also come forth. We
might as well make a good job of this inquiry
while we are about it.
Even when it is
merely a question
whether two roosters
are alike, the subtle
Justice Isaacs can
manage to see vast
differences which re-
fuse to appear to the
eye of Chief Justice
Griffith. Some cigar-
makers in Havana
have been chasing a
Sydney tobacconist
for selling smokes
with a brand so much
like theirs as to be
an infringement, they
thought, of their
trademark —an eagle.
On April 29 the High
Court finally disposed
of the case. Griffith,
C.J., announced . that
the sole test was
whether the bird advertising
defendant’s cigars could be mis-
taken for the fowl appearing on
plaintiff’s, such test being the evi-
dence of the eyesight. He
(Griffith 1 ) with his own eyes had
no difficulty in finding as a fact
that the eagles were as like as two
peas. Plaintiff one up and two to
play. Isaacs followed, and de-
clared that “judged by the stan-
dard of identity, of which the eye
was the sole test, it was quite
plain that the birds were different.”
All square; one to play. Then
Duffy gave it as his opinion that
the fowls were much of a much-
ness, but, all things considered,
he judged that plaintiff hadn’t
established his case. Plaintiff one down,
and costs to pay.

“De Yid”: Is there no hope of bringing
the divorce laws of the States into line?
Two years ago we were told that a Bill for
the purpose was to be pushed through with
all speed. So far it seems to have been
shoved with great delay. Take one example
of the present slovenliness. A husband,
deserted by a wife who from choice or spite
or lack of opportunity thereafter remains
strictly virtuous, can in N. S. Wales get a
divorce in three years. In Victoria the time
is two years. But here in South Aus. he
must wait till Doomsday. As his chances
of success in Heaven must be extremely
slender, surely it is up to a country which
needs little immigrants to give him a chance
of re-marriage on earth. True, even here
in Adelaide, if he has not heard of the lady
for seven years he may advertise the fact,
and, after waiting a reasonable while for
an intimation that she is living, may pre-
sume her dead and re-marry; but the
spectre of her possible reappearance hovers
round the new double-bed at all times.
“Gift of Presbyterians” is an Argus
headline describing some beneficence at
Broadmeadows camp. What are the
soldiers expected to do with their Presby-
terians now they’ve got them, and who gave
these particular Presbyterians away? There
is a somewhat similar case at Bendigo,
where a citizen has advertised his intention
of raffling his mother-in-law “for the Bel-
gians.”
WE A THEN PROOF.
“ There's a westerly blowing — don't you think
you'd better put something on your chest?”
“It's all right, Charlie. I've powdered it
three times."
“Chasuble”: Dean McCarthy, of Mel-
bourne, with a handful of truth, opens the
little finger and lets out a few grains in
regard to the functions of M. Cerretti. He
says there is no appeal from the Papal Dele-
gate to the Pope, but the Archbishops may
refer cases straight to Rome without con-
sulting him. Everything shows that, with
all their admirable courtesy, Dr. Carr, Dr.
Kelly and the others did not want him. A
leading R.C. newspaper says, frankly, that
the faithful thought that matters might
have been left to their Archbishops, but that
they bow to Rome. The whole truth seems
to be that the Italian interest is determined
to rule both in Australia and in America.
Again I declare that Bishop Phelan went
to Rome for definition of the Cerretti
authority, and its limitation; and possibly
he secured the proviso that Cerretti may be
evaded by the Archbishops. Incidentally,
the Delegate warmly supports the proposed
Newman College at Melbourne University,
and the R.C. aristocracy is the better dis-
posed towards him on this account, being
anxious to drive it ahead.
The Adelaide City Council is
starting additions to the Town
Hall on a big scale, chiefly with
the idea of giving the official
staff more room. There was
an idea of sacrificing the
Prince Alfred Hotel, which is
“corporation” property, but
that was too good to lose, so
the new building will mostly
be at the back. Mayor Simp-
lon, in laying the stone, said
Adelaide would scatter £30,000
on this and the markets, a
record year’s expenditure, un-
dertaken chiefly to relieve
drought and war distress. A
prominent figure at the shivoo
was Edwin Smith, now 85, but
vigorous. He is the oldest sur-
viving mayor, the first of his five
years of office being as far back as 1870;
and he was prominent at the foundation of
the Town Hall, away in far-distant 1868.
“0.K.”: In the discussion of restrictive
or prohibitive liquor legislation one hears
nothing about the possibilities of a temporary
war-time prohibition resulting in permanent
temperance among the workers. Prohibition
is suggested only as an emergency measure,
to meet present necessities in the war-supply
trades, like a strong dose of physic for a
man with a disordered liver, who has to
run a mile next day. It might be more for-
cibly advocated as a surgical operation for a
poor devil who cannot be otherwise put in
the way to get well. A hardened boozer,
compelled to sober up and remain sober for
months, is bound to devote some of the time
to reflecting on his altered condition. “Drink-
cure” establishments are really founded on
the fact that some of the patients that
come along will be capable of curing
themselves after they have served a term for
reflection. Admitting that sobriety is the
best policy, they will have sufficient will-
power to adopt it. Taught by experience
that one drink demands many in their case,
they will swear off it, instead of risking the
experiment with the one drink. Now, a
worker in a shipyard or cannon foundry,
denied the means to get drink, would be in
a better position for wise reflection than an
idle boozer patient at an “institute.” His
earnings would increase, and none of his
wages would be dissolved in alcohol. The
rewards of sobriety would thus be tangible
and immediate. He would soon feel better
off than ever he was in his life before, and
probably, when the prohibition was lifted,
he would never go all the way back to what
lie used to be. In short, the temporary
knocking-off of an able-bodied, weak-minded
worker’s liquor is an appeal to his common-
sense and better nature; therefore the Trade
calls it interference with the liberty of the
subject, and robbing a poor man of his only
joy.

A scientific party has arranged to visit
the Chatham Islands, a wind-swept group
lying about 500 miles eastward of Lyttelton
(M.L.). It was here that the last Moriori
died a week or so back, but with the rush of
war news the incident got only casual men-
tion in the local correspondent’s notes. The
story is current that the Maoris resident there
have a distinctly Spanish cast of feature,
which is ascribed to an early visit of
Spaniards. There is no record to support
this theory, apparently, but it is worth in-
vestigation, coupled with the Hargrave theory
of early Spanish settlement in Australia. The
history of the Moriori, who were chiefly ab-
sorbed by the gastric juices of the Maori, is
another awful example of what may happen
to people who refuse to buy a gun.
The notion that instead of being hard-

sarcastic things about the dull monotony of
seeing his head on stamps, and made a plea

Colonel Maclaurin, killed in action,
reputedly by a shell-burst at the very begin-
ning of the Dardanelles fighting, was a big
man in the making. When he got a brigade
there were murmurings. In fact, there were
curses, he being a young and comparatively
inexperienced officer; but he did well from
the jump, and better with every week that
passed. lie was a replica, as regards char-
acter, of Dr. Normand Maclaurin, his
father, and liis inseparable associate till
the latter’s death. As much as a young
man and an old one could think alike, they
did. At the Bar in Sydney Maclaurin was
doing well and would have done better. He
never tried to be brilliant —brilliancy wasn’t
his metier in any walk of life—but he was
sound, perfectly clear-headed, and before he
undertook a thing he knew all about it.
His arbitration work in the Gas Co.’s matter
so edified the directors that some of them
became bores on the subject of his merits
for years afterwards. A lot of his best
qualities—his strength, kindness and good
humor —were written on his pleasant Scotch
face.

Melba raised £247 by singing on Sunday

contralto, just good enough for chorus. She
was more admired as a whistler. She learnt
violin and organ, and used to practise on the
Collins-street Scots’ Church organ, so the
kirk wasn’t at all unfamiliar to her the
other Sabbath. ,
Vernon Reed, just disqualified as a mem-
ber of Maorilaud Parliament and warned
off the course for 12 months, might have
gone a long way in Loanly politics with a
good trainer, for he had most of the quali-
ties which make for success in that arena.
First he sought the bubble reputation as an
anti-Seddonite, but repented and lived to
become a Wardite. During the debacle it
was Reed who officiated as wire-puller-in-
chief behind Tom Mackenzie. At the
party caucus he proposed the wily Tom as
leader in succession to Joe, and led the
cheering when Mackenzie met the House
as Premier. Then he hopped over the fence
and helped Massey give Tannnas the knock
and a job in London as High Commissioner.
It was the most astonishing “rat” on
Maorilaud record. Reed was originally a
County clerk, and became a lawyer, but as
he married into the T. C. Williams clan,
which doesn’t have to bother about over-
drafts the pursuit of Costs has been more
or less a sideline. Incidentally, he floated
the biggest cement proposition south of the
line, and tore from Massey a license to har-
ness the Wairuna Falls on the Wairoa River
for power purposes. Brother John is a Iv.C.

ago edited the N.Z. Herat, n, and afterwards
wrote leaders for the Fairfaxes in Sydney.

Smiths, and above all in journalism. In
that line one reckons up Melbourne’s James
Smith, G. P. Smith, H. J. Smith, Jardine
Smith, Gervase Smith, “Wingy” Smith,
“Eclipse” Smith, C. L. Smith and T. Smith,
the last two being sons of James. Three
Melbourne Mayors: J. T. Smith, A. Iv.
Smith and C. Smith. Then the never-forget-
able R. S. Smythe, with the barristers C.
A. Smyth and F. L. Smyth. The Smiths
of Sydney have been, on the whole, more
humble, and generally stodgy. The mon-
niker seemed to have entered into their
souls. Adelaide, on the other hand, has
been conspicuous with its Smiths. The
Public Libraries have a book on the family,
sizing up Adam Smith, Alexander Smith
the poet,- Goldwin Smith, Carrington Smith,
and on to bookseller W. 11. Smith, who
became Head of the Admiralty and original
of Sir Joseph Porter in H.M.S. Pinafore.
The action of the Lower House
of Convocation of Canterbury in
electing Charles I. of England a
saint has, it is said, caused a good
deal of discussion among the people
who were saints already. Many of
them talk of reprisals, and
threaten to elect Casanova and
Sardanapalus members of the
Lower House of Convocation of
Canterbury.
Col. Lancelot Fox Clarke, D. 5.0., com-
manding 12th Australian Infantry Battalion,
who was killed at the Dardanelles, was but
recently married to Miss Beatrice Moffat,
granddaughter of that Surgeon-Major H. B.
Hinton who is living in Adelaide in his
103rd year. Hinton was in the Indian
Mutiny and Burmese campaigns.
As octogenarian Thomas Burgoyne, who
sat in the South Aus. Parliament for over 80
years, failed to secure re-election, the
“father” of the House of Assembly is Alex-
ander McDonald, member for Alexandra.
“Fighting Mac” his fellow members call him.
He has been in Parliament continuously for
28 years.
BLESSINGS ON THE KING.
McPHAIRSON : “I cantia offer ye a drink ,

Thomas Bolivar Blyth, the picturesque
Sergeant-at-Arms of the Tas. Assembly, cele-
brated his 90th birthday on April 24. Except
on special occasions the towering, befrilled
and uniformed frame of the old man is sel-
dom seen doing a slow and dignified totter
across the floor of the Chamber to announce
“Mr. Speaker” these times, most of the active
service of the office being performed by Clerk-
Assistant Frank Green. It is understood
that when Thomas Bolivar becomes utterly
tired of his job the ancient office of Sergeant-
at-Arms will be abolished in Tasmania. The
Speck Assembly never owned a mace—per-
haps because it was considered inadvisable
to leave such a weapon within reach of the
legislators of ’54. As a result, the Sergeant
has never had to search for the bauble in the
shadowy private haunts of pranky legislators.
About a Very Worthy Citizen: —
Lieut.-Cqlonel Astley Onslow-Thompson, killed in
action in the Dardanelles, was a remarkable character
in many ways. He was a cousin of the Camden Park
(N'.S.W.) Onslows, and came to Sydney from England
quarter of a century ago. He began with some useful
qualities: he never said two words where one suf-
ficed, he was absolutely reliable, and he was a
tiger for work. After holding a small job for a year
or so he waded in to organise the Camden estate.
Against the advice of all the experts he proceeded
to introduce the English tenant system. It can fairly
be said that he succeeded. Menangle is a model
town in its way. There are people who like to be
tenants, to be shepherded and instructed and looked
after and shown the way tp allegedly higher and
better things, social and political, and from then-
point of view the Camden estate, with its wealth of
individualistic Socialism, represents an earthly para-
dise. Whatever it is to-day, Onslow-Thompson made
it. He was as efficient in the city as he was on the
land. As a director of the Commercial Bank and
the C.S.R. he won the unwilling respect of everybody
associated with him. Unwilling, for he was a dour
customer, and looked it, and had no social graces.
Ilis fund of knowledge was vast and varied. He
knew as much of Shakspeare as he did of Silos, and
his acquaintance with the latter was intimate. He
was an expert Pig-master, and he knew every London
Punch cartoon of the past 25 years and its history.
He would have made a good banker, perhaps a great
one, for he had originality and courage. His soldier-
ing was as thorough as the rest of his work. He
formed the Camden Light Horse, and he knew his
job well. When the details of the Dardanelles land-
ing come through we shall certainly find that he
died, as he lived, doing what he regarded as his
duty, in his silent, unobtrusive and dogged fashion.
It was fitting that there should be a Lalor
in Australia’s second big fight—a grandson
of Peter, who was its leader in the first. Old
Peter gave an arm; the grandson, his life.
This second Lalor was Captain Joseph
Peter, of G Company, 12th Infantry, mainly
composed of Westralians. He had crowded
many experiences into 80 years. Born at
Richmond ‘(Vic.) lie drifted away into the
navy about 1900, served a couple of years
with the Foreign Legion of France in
Algiers, shouldered a rifle in a South Ameri-
can shindy, and then came back home. Join-
ing the Commonwealth instructional staff in
1910 he was appointed a staff-officer in W.A.,
being subsequently transferred to Queensland.
His wife, a niece of Dr. Loughrey, of Haw-
thorn (Vic.), took their little child to Eng-
land for the waiting till the long, long march
was over, doe’s brother followed his father,
and became a doctor. He is at Duntroon.
Yon Tempskv, the* famous fighter against
Henare in the Maori war of the (Ms. has
a grandson in the MX. forces. Grandfather
was a Pole holding a commission in the
Prussian cavalry; but, disgusted, he lett it
and went free-lancing with his sword in
Central America, and, later, in MX. He
was shot in 1868 by a furious .John Maoii
during trouble in the Taranaki bush.
Captain E. J. Evans, who slipped
his cable at Wellington (MX.)
lately, after being Marine Super-
intendent for the big Shaw, Savill
Co. for many years, was a mate
on the Pembroke Castle, one of the
liners owned by Sir Donald Currie,
during a private cruise in the early
’Bo’s along the coast of Scotland
and Scandinavia. The party on
board included Donald Currie,
W. E. Gladstone, Tennyson and the
present Mrs. Asquith. At Copen-
hagen Queen Alexandra (then
Princess of Wales), the Czar
(Alexander III.), the King and
Queen of Denmark and the King
and Queen of Greece were enter-
tained on board. Evans, who
weighed about half a ton, never
forgot that he once walked the
bridge of a liner weighted over her
Plimsoll by persons of such suffo-
cating affluence and dignity.
“Ami” on a useful Melbourne family:—
“Finglass” (B. 6/5/’is) is not quite accurate in
regard to the levers family. William levers, sen.,
began active life as an English soldier. Though a
stern Irish Catholic, he was, like John O’Slianassy,
in opposition to any and every rebellion against Eng-
land. For the bulk of his Melbourne life he was a
rate-collector for the City Council; then he founded
levers and Sons, land auctioneers. When his boy,
William, legislator and "City Councillor, died, aged
about 50, the old man replaced him as a councillor,
but lived’ only a few years, being succeeded by his
younger son, the present G. levers. William, jun.,
was a remarkably fine character, widely beloved by his
contemporaries. He was a rich elocutionist, and,
during Barry Sullivan’s management of the Theatre
Royal, appeared as Don Jose in “Don Cajsar de
Bazan.” Sullivan offered him an engagement. The
Don Caesar, by the way, was Mike Moloney, after-
wards of Sydney, brother of Dr. Pat Moloney, author
of the well-known sonnet on Melbourne. The Mel-
bourne Public Library has a book which I have much
enjoyed. It is a record of the tour taken by the
two William levers, father and son, through Pales-
tine, Ireland, England, Paris and what not.
PROFESSOR LYLE , of Melbourne Univer-
sity, now retiring to carry on research work.
Captain Ronald Burns, of Lithgow, killed
at the Dardanelles, was one of the exchange
officers sent away some years ago by Defence
Minister Pearce for training in India and
England. He had finished his Indian
training and completed his courses at
Aldershot and Farnham when he re-
ceived from his father a cheque to
spend on holidaying. What his idea of a
holiday was may be judged by the fact that
he spent the money in obtaining a pilot’s cer-
tificate at the military flying school at
Hendon. He was only in his twenties when
the black camel came.
“NEXT-OF-KIN: MOTHER."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Mother of him, so piteously young
To be to dealh thus mercilessly tiling',
Who with his boyish laugh
Looks innocently from his photograph,
And whose brief, bitter fame
Is but his published portrait and his name—•
Mother, whose tears yet blind
The pride and courage that you yearn to find,
Put on the guilty murderers their sin,
Accuse them, though they lie ;
The criminal war-plotters of Berlin
Decreed your son should die!
Mother, who watched him from your fond arms grow
Into a man, and proudly let him go—
Vo tears ! —to serve his King,
When he was but a tiny, stumbling thing
The Potsdam plotters grim
Conceived the callous plan that dug for him
liis lonely grave afar.
Vou little guessed you nurtured him for war!
Watching you tend him, from his first weak breath,
They marked your pretty baby down for death.
If is death —a million deaths —the assassins planned.
What mattered it to them?
But when before the Throne the murdered stand,
What God would not condemn?
So thus it ends, and all the care you gave,
And all your hopes are buried in one grave.
’Twas but for this you bore
A man-child —-and your dearest dream is o’er.
No! By your slaughtered son
The battle ’gainst the Super-Fiends is won;
And he lies down in pride,
Happy to know he saved you, though he died,
From murder, worse than murder, by the Huns!
So in your grief endure,
For while there are such mothers and such sons,
Our victory is sure.
N.S.W.

A lot: of things have happened since October,
most of them not such as to make us very
cheerful. At that time Australia knew
pretty well that it could not have a good
harvest. It was not sure till the next
month that the harvest would be one of
the worst two on record. And it did not
know until the last couple of months that
it would also suffer very heavy losses of
stock, which are more serious even than the
failure of the wheat and now the partial
failure of the sugar crop. The misfortune,
great at any time, is vastly greater because
it stops us from giving the help to the Em-
pire and its friends which we want to give.
Still, the biscuit isn’t all weevils: there are
more than a few crumbs left from the tine
seasons and general prosperity wo had for
half a dozen years before 1914.
These accounts did not leave the London
Board till the middle of March; and by that
time the bank knew what it had to face.
The profit disclosed may therefore be taken
to have been earned after providing for
every known contingency; and it has been
the ’Asia’s policy for many years to pro-
vide as well for a few that it couldn’t think
of. Hence, besides the visible reserves which
have been piled up, amounting to nearly half
as much again as. the capital, it has internal
reserves whose size is of course unknown,
but must be very considerable. For in-
stance, the premises are set down as an
asset worth less than £15,000, whereas they
are worth, say. £750,000; and a lot of that
is revenue-producing. So far as the deposi-
tors are concerned, this means that tlieir
money is protected by at least three-quarters
of a million more assets than they can see
in the balance-sheet. The prestige which
this gives the ’Asia has enabled it to offer
very liberal accommodation during the past
year. Here are the figures:—
Oct., ’l3. Oct., ’l4.
Notes.. .. £168,818 £202,995 Inc. £34,177
Bills, etc. .. 2,768,848 2,896,301 Inc. 127,453
Deposits ..18,088,955 19,108,792 Inc. 1,019,837
Liquid assets.. 8,349,113 7,146,583 Dec. 1,202,530
Advances ..17,565,435 20,041,791 Inc. 2,476,356
Premises .. 2,241 14,288 Inc. 12,047
Of that extra two and a half millions lent
out, no less than a million and a half was
advanced to customers during the April-
October six months. A bank which kept
itself in a position to come so well to the
rescue at a time of stress deserves well of
the country, even if it does pay a 17 p.c.
dividend. And, anyway, if you throw only
the visible reserves into the heap with the
capital, the return on the lot comes down to
a shade under 7 p.c. A great part of these
reserves, moreover, came direct from share-
holders in the shape of premium capital.
Depositors will note, if they compare the
balance-sheets for the last two halves, that
deposits have shrunk a few thousands ; and
as customers have been given a further
million and a half or thereabouts of accom-
modation, the liquid assets have been neces-
sarily drawn upon pretty heavily. But
much of those extra advances represent
wool; and a good deal of this has since been
turned into money at prices which seemed
too much to even hope for six months ago.
In any case the liquid holding was still quite
large enough to meet any emergency which
sanity can suggest: and behind all that is
the £4,824,575 of visible share capital and
reserves, as well as the afore-mentioned
reserves which the bank could shake out of
its well-filled sleeves.

S. Australia has had an appalling year, fol-
lowing- on one which was only very moderate.
Unfortunately the trouble didn’t stop in the
wheat-growing districts: it spread into the
sheep country, and that has meant, not
merely a shrivelled harvest, but a very
serious loss of capital, which will
reduce the output for four or five
years to corue. In the circumstances,
and in view of the necessity for
providing pretty largely for contingencies,
a slump in the disclosed profits of this bank
was quite to be expected. No doubt the
actual profits, apart from the necessary pro-
vision for drought losses, were considerably
reduced. Deposits have been dearer, ex-
change earnings have been cut down, and the
dislocation of the Broken Hill trade must
have affected the earnings. The picture is
all so different from the one that was on the
easel 12 months ago. “It is much too early
to say what the next harvest and wool clip
will be,” the Wild Cat purred at that time,
"but the start is all right, and there never
was a time when Broken Hill, S. Australia’s
best cow, gave a richer lot of milk.” Within
three months Drought had pushed its nose in
and the cow had put its foot in the bucket.
The Adelaide is the S.A. Government’s
banker, and some of the big changes shown
in the next comparison may be due to heavy
drawings by the State: —

In cirfufetajjlgft, it is a pity this bank
doesn't adopt tin?” Vie. system and separate
Government and private deposits. A with-
drawal of one-third of the deposits is calcu-
lated to give weak depositors an uneasy
feeling which they wouldn’t have if they
knew that the withdrawn money had been
merely lodged by the Government for
little more than safe custody. But
though so much money has had to
be paid out to satisfy the Govern-
ment, and, it may be, other depositors, the
holding of coin, etc., is still very strong.
Out of its liquid assets, mostly money, de-
posits at short call and Government deben-
tures, the bank could pay 11s. 4d. in the £
of all its deposits and other debts. After
that it would still owe £1,641,404; but it
would have assets valued in the books at over
£2,700,000 to pay them with. There is a
lot of comfort in those figures, even if there
isn’t a great deal of profit. Still, that will
be all right presently. Between its
particularly cruel drought and the war S.
Australia has had an unusually tight pinch;
nevertheless, after so many years of great
prosperity, it has lots of fat still to live on.
And the accumulation of more fat doesn’t
take long in an agricultural country when
the land has had a rest and war-famished
people elsewhere are crying for the food
they can’t grow themselves.

is going to very seriously affect the coming
sugar crop, and there will have to be heavy
imports. That isn’t unusual. Only three
years in the last 10 has Australia grown
enough sugar to satisfy its own tooth. What
makes the position serious this time is that,
according to the story told by the chairman
at the half-yearly meeting, “the maximum
price fixed Iby the Prices Boards in N. S.
Wales and Victoria] is ‘about £8 a ton below
that at which the produce from raw im-
ported sugar could be sold.” This may be
so. But it is this co.’s misfortune that it
chronically takes so gloomy a view of every-
thing—or, rather, puts that sort of view
before the public—that when there really
may be cause for gloom the official Jere-
miads are more or less disregarded. So
far as the general public is concerned, the
co. will in any case get no sympathy, mostly
for the reason that repeatedly it has shown
itself utterly contemptuous of public feeling-
one way or the other. Thus, in issuing-
bonuses it has more than once seemed to
deliberately choose the very moment when
there has been a public outcry against the
co.’s profits. . This of course concerns the
investor; for it makes it much more likely
that the time will come when the co. will be
put under restraint. It may be a beautiful
thing to have a monopoly. But there are
disadvantages. It is so much easier then
for the State to either take the whole thing
over or impose restrictions.
What the true profits were during last
half-year nobody knows who only knows
what the published accounts disclose. On
the eo.’s own showing it never before made
so much profit in its life. This was no
doubt partly due to the fact that shortly
after the war started the price of sugar went
up, because of the mess made of the Ger-
man beet-sugar business, and in Queensland
at any rate a higher selling price was per-
mitted on that account. The present
squeeze is to make the other States authorise
a higher price also. If the co. succeeds there
will be a nice extra profit coming from the
stocks on hand. On March 31 these were
quite unusual. There is rarely more than
about £350,000 worth of stock at that time
of year; this year there was £742,914 worth.
It is pretty safe to say that, whatever they
may do presently, the Prices Boards will not
let the public be bitten for any more until
these stocks are consumed. And even after
that, if there is any need to import, it is
not impossible that the States may fix a price
which will not permit the co. to earn 121
p.c. on capital much of which is watered.
Distinctly, there are clouds ahead of the
C. 5.11.
The bisection of the co. may do something
to turn away wrath. The new co., to take
over all Fiji and Maoriland assets, includ-
ing goodwill, is to be called the “Colonial
Sugar Refining Co., Ltd. (Fiji and New
Zealand).” The purchase consideration is
£3,250,000, which is the amount of capital
of the present co. In payment the new co.
is to hand the present co. fixed cumulative
0 p.c. pref. shares to that amount, so that
for each present share the holder, while re-
taining that share, will get a pref. share in
the. new co. These new shares will not be
entitled to more than G p.c.; so, to absorb
any surplus profits the new co. may make,
the. present co. subscribes for £250,000 of
ordinary capital. As to management:—•
The ordinary shares will be held intact by the
parent co., except that a certain number will be put
in the names of the directors and higher officers, so
that the statutory meetings can be held. These
shareholders can increase the capital by the issue
of more ordinary shares.
Also :
The holders of the pref. shares, in accordance with
the usual practice, will not have votes.
Shareholders will see from that what they
have done. They have cut off £3,250,000
of their assets, and handed them over to a
co. for which they have supplied all the capi-
tal, but in the conduct of which they are to
have no direct say at all. The only people
who will have votes will be “the directors
and higher officers.”
Probably shareholders will not regard this
as of any consequence. Certainly if they
are quite frank with themselves they will
confess, that they have no real power now.
The “directors and higher officers” rule the
parent just as much as they will the pup.
From the shareholders’ point of view there
will, however, be one very distinct advan-
tage. The public which is merely an eater
of sugar is dropping to the real meaning of
bonus share issues. Quite a lot of people
nowadays know that 121 p.c. paid on capital
which is half water is really 25 p.c. The
new co. is a more subtle device. It amounts
to a. magnificent watering of £3,250,000, and
the issue of bonus shares to that amount. If
the two cos. divide only the present total
of money, then the new co. will pay G p.c.
and the parent co. will stand forth as a poor
old body, much reduced in circumstances,
and paying only 6| p.c. And that will give
it a pretext for imploring the world to pay
another farthing for sugar so that it may
divide a moderate 71 p.c. among its share-
holders.

There is £30,000 of the last half-year’s profit
set aside as a reserve for extensions and
alterations, and no doubt that will be
written off presently, and either spent or
saved up in a stocking and passed out to
shareholders as a bonus. There has been a
good deal of writing down and subsequent
writing up in this co. It really isn’t the
co.’s fault: it is the public’s for not being
able to make up its mind what it is going
to do with the liquor trade. To-day it
wrings the trade’s hand; to-morrow it is
going to wring its neck—and doesn’t.
The trade has been tremendously fortu-
nate in its enemies. They have been the
most impracticable persons in the com-
munity—buzz flies making fierce attacks on
a pyramid. But it really looks as if they
are being controlled now by people who will
bring a lot more wisdom to the job. There
is a tremendous volume of citizens, not a
bit wowsery, who on general principles are
prepared to go a step or two with the anti-
liquor crowd. And the anti-liquor crowd,
thus restrained, seems to have now decided
to bring in reform not in a hogshead, but
in a pint-pot. The S. Australian 6 o’clock
vote, following the suppression of dozens of
pubs, one or two at a time, is' a sample of
the new method. It seems to this paper
the most serious campaign the trade ever
had to face. Tooth and Co.’s management
apparently sees -no reason, though, why it
should seek to escape by pretending to be a
poor creature not worth hunting. This is
the proper position. Sometimes people
have to sell shares; and they have a perfect
right to sell them. When, in pursuit of a
cunning policy, directors misrepresent the
earnings of a co., they simply rob these
shareholders—widows in many cases —who
have to realise. It is one thing to provide
out of the earnings of one year for losses
which may reasonably be expected to arise
out of that year’s business; it is quite
another thing to make profit and stuff it
away in order, for some reason or other, to
mislead the public.
Tooth and Co., Ltd., has been so care-
fully managed, and it has had such a mag-
nificent field to till, that its financial posi-
tion is one of luxurious ease. Here are
some figures

Certainly you have to remember that assets
were written up £350,000 about three years
ago; but that would not bring the breweries,
etc., up to £1,000,000, which would leave
over £383,903 added to that item out of
profit and over a quarter of a million
has been added to others, while on
the other side the addition to the
liabilities is quite negligible. There
can’t be a doubt as to the splendid
achievements of the co. in the past 10 years.
What will happen to it in the next 10 years
this paper declines to prophesy for sixpence.

By way '<>)' a hint that the less favorable
figures for the past year are all Willie’s
fault, the management drops this into the
lb and L. account: “War losses, £45.771.”
On this point the directors, becoming quite
talkative, say : “The operations of the co.
were seriously affected by the outbreak of
war in August last, and, as will be seen by
the balance-sheet, caused a loss of £45.771.
chiefly upon island produce shipments.”
The Bulletin lias some doubts about the
syntax; but what does syntax matter now
that the copra market lias become quite
respectable again? The trouble at present
is not to get a price for it on the other
side, but to get ships to take the stuff there;
and if you can sret a ship the freight suggests
that the skipper is stoking with Treasury
bills or burning eau-de-Cologne.
However, when the war ends as it has
got to end, things should certainly be no
worse for 8., P. <& Co. Their most serious
competition was coming from the German—
in fact, had come. With the Dutchman the
hatchet had been buried long ago. The
Dutchman, though in matters of commerce
accused of giving too little and asking too
much, doesn’t at any rate want the earth;
so the usual understanding was possible so
far as the trade between here, Papua, Java
and Singapore was concerned. The Ger-
man, oh the other hand, wasn’t going
whacks with anybody but himself; and his
service to Maoriland, decided on early last'
year, wasn’t calculated to do British steam-
ship owners in the South Pacific any good.
Admittedly the future of those seas and the
specks upon them is very uncertain. But
it is hardly possible to see how things can
change for the worse there so far as this co.
is concerned. As for the Queensland, Papua
and Malay trade, there is clearly room for
enormous development. The investor is, at
the same time, entitled to remember that
.Tames Burns, the founder and managing
director of the co., is not immortal. There
may be on hand other James Burnses, or
men with other qualities equally valuable.
That is a risk the investor must take.
There have been no tremendously import-
ant balance-sheet changes during the year:

What recent movements there have been
have been mostly the right way. Shipping
is a reduced item: this is doubtless due to
writing down. The depreciation allowed for
on all items (apart from book debts) was
£38,201, and it may be taken for granted
that the amount thus struck off is ample
cover. On top of that provision, and after
providing for sundry other reserves, there
is £35,817 available to lay by, notwith-
standing the special war loss of £45.771.
Add those two items and you get an amount
25 p.c. greater than the dividend. That and
the history of the previous three years sug-
gest that under normal conditions the G|
p.c. gives little idea of the insults the co.
is really capable of offering to its share-
holders.

The Australian Provincial Assurance Associa-
tion, Ltd. — A Half-Year’s Progress.—This Associa-
tion on the 30th April closed it accounts for the
first half of its third financial year, and notable pro-
gress has been shown when a comparison is made
with the corresponding period of the second financial
year. The new business totals from November 1,
1914, to April 30 last show an increase of 60 per-
cent. on the new business completed for the corres-
ponding period, 1913-1914. The renewal premiums
received for the half-year just ended showed an
increase exceeding 55 per cent, on the total received
for the half-year ending April 30, 1914. This is
considered excellent progress, and is particularly
creditable when it is taken into consideration that
the increased results have been obtained notwith-
standing that the war has been raging for nine
months. This shows conclusively the progressive
policy adopted by this young and vigorous associa-
tion. Progressing- at this rate, the figures for the
present financial year, which ends on October 31,
will compare favorably with much longer established
assurance offices.*

ROYDS, LTD., Investors’ Advisers, Challis House, Sydney
and thus far of the 44,903 shares (£- fuly
paid) in the Haymarket 42,916 had been
bought up to December 31. at an average
cost of £2 ss. per share, and a few more
have since been wiped up. The co. is thus
what is known as a holding co.: its business
is to hold the shares in other businesses
which issue their own accounts and pay
their own dividends. But though they issue
their own accounts they don t necessarily
issue them to the public. In. fact, when
tilings are arranged like this it is usually
to avoid the publication of any details what-
ever—except perhaps the amount paid by
way of dividend, In this case the common
practice is in one particular departed from.
A holding co. usually shows in its 1. and
L. account: “By dividends received from
So-and-So.” The subsidiary co. thus keeps
its own undivided profits. But Arthur
Rickard & Co. Extended, Ltd., is credited
with “net profits disclosed by P. and L.
account” of the subsidiary co. The whole
thing is confusing. There should be one co.
—not three. And the directors’, report only
leads to further confusion; for it is printed
as though the total gross profit of Arthur
Rickard & Co., Ltd., was £35,382, whereas
that is the gross profit of Arthur Rickard
& Co. Extended, Ltd.
Still that is not the most serious result
of the medley. Far worse is it that, since
the shareholder individually is not. a share-
holder of Arthur Rickard & Co., Ltd., or of
the Haymarket Co., he cannot command a
look at the accounts of those concerns. The
assets of this co. total £297,282. Of this
£150,000 is represented by Rickard shares.
But what assets there are to represent that
£150,000 the shareholder doesn’t know.. Cer-
tainly The Bulletin will give this in: if
he did know he might be none the wiser.
For many years the Haymarket Co., accord-
ing to its published accounts, had assets
£25,000 in excess of its capital, which would
make the shares worth about 505.;. yet at
that time there were shareholders willing to
sell at under 255. And while the subsidiary
co. need not disclose to the people who really
own it what its assets are, it (and this is
even more important) need not disclose
either what its liabilities are. In other
words, Arthur Rickard & Co.. Ltd., and
the Haymarket Co., Ltd., may between them
owe a quarter of a million (The Bulletin
has no idea what they do owe), and the real
owners of the concerns may know nothing
about it. Their property may thus, carry a
heavy mortgage of which they are ignorant.
This stands against live stock as an in-
vestment. In its favor as a speculation you
can if you like put the fact , that the de-
clared net profits of Arthur Rickard & Co.,
I fid., for the year 1914 were £27,963, which
means over 18 p.c. on that co.’s capital of
£150,000. And the prospectus showed even
more dazzling results than that in earlier
years. The total profit of A. R. Extended,
Ltd., was £33,251; but that includes £5480
“net profits disclosed by P. and L. account”
of Arthur Rickard & Co., Ltd., as at March

ber 31, 1914” (what happened between
March 31. 1913. and January 1, 1914.. isn’t
explained). The £33,251 was got rid of

From 11. W. Apperley, sec. of the
A.M.P. :• —-
The Bulletin misconstrues one set of figures in tlie
society’s report, making it appear that the cash bonus
dividend in 1914 was £1,034,346, and that for the
past year £1,026,139 is divisible. As a matter of
fact, the cash bonuses allotted for the year 1913
amounted to £975,881, or with interim bonuses
paid with claims falling in during the year,
£983,528. The corresponding figures for 1914 are
£1,026,139 and £1,034,346 respectively, so that
it will be seen there has been, an increase of over
£50,000 in the amount of cash bonuses distributed
as compared with the previous year. There are, as
shown in the report, more policy-holders to share in
the increased distribution, and the general effect
has been to provide individual bonuses of about the
same amount in reversionary value, while being
slightly larger when measured by their cash equiva-
lent.
The negotiations between the 1.0. A. and
the Howard Smith Co. have come to
nothing, after all, and, according to a memo,
issued by the insurance office, have been
“definitely abandoned.”

The most important recent development
at Ardlethan is the striking of water —
artesian or otherwise —in a bore on the
Wild Cherry. At latest, with a depth of
something a little over 300 ft. in the hole,
there is a depth of nearly 200 ft. of moisture.
The other day 6000 gallons were pumped
in eight hours, and there remained 6Sft. in
the bore. The Southern Cross battery has
just handled .100 tons of Carpathia seconds,
and recovered 11 tons of concentrates, it
is disappointing. The Cherry has struck
a lode in the crosscut at 150 ft. This is
satisfactory inasmuch as it shows the per-
sistence of stone ; but only a Gin. streak is
of much value. The Crystal is running
on stone from the open-cut, sweetened by
pickings from rich shoots. The Champion
has spoken the first time for 12 months —
one ton of concentrates from 20 tons of
stone. Nobody will buy a steam-yacht with
the proceeds.

If its luck holds out, a locally-owned
N.S.W. gold mine threatens to pay a divi-
dend ! Hawkins Hill Reward is the
iconoclast, and the insult may arrive in
June. The caterpillar in the rosebud is*
that, so far as ore reserves go, the co. is
living from hand to mouth.

The Spartans who sit round Jimmy
Mackay’s table in the Melbourne Board-
room have hoisted New Langi Logan calls
from 3d. to 6d. A sad lot, who thought the
late reduction was permanent and hadn’t
the sense to see that two mines couldn’t be
worked on modest monthly thrums, now
want to bludgeon the directors. If they did
it on account of the puff that accompanied
the pill, this paper would forgive them. It.
is sickening to again hear the story about
drives here and water everywhere. More to
the point is the average of an oz. yield from
300 fathoms. But there is a horrid dread
that the puddling will not pan out like that.
In fact, Toole confesses that his latest sam-
ples were only worth lOdwt. They may have
come from outside around, but they caused
a nasty sensation all the same. The Langi
is now pinning its faith to the drive under
the Cathcart gutter from No. 2 shaft. If
that doesn’t give better samples, there won’t
be enough warmth in the Langi market to
make the Ararat crowd comfortable in
winter quarters.
* * * *
Northern Hope, Beaufort (Vic.), looks like
a fixture on the dividend list for a. while.
The gutter is shallow, and costs are so low
that out of £11,836 of gold the co. was able
to pay five sixpenny dividends in the half-
year. Some 6000 fathoms are ready for the
panellers. If they keep up to the present
average of 25dwt. and costs don’t jump, there
will be plenty of jam for those who have
had the pluck to cling on to scrip. The best
ground is round No. 2 rise off the south-
west branch-reef drive. North the lead is
swinging away from the old party’s work-
ings. They left) payable dirt in the face,
and the estimate is that round the No. 1
rise a block of nearly 3000 fathoms will go
25dwt. The co. has a nice stretch of the
gutter to handle; but Fred Holst seems to
have got in early with an option to float off
a block, so a pup may see the daylight before
long. The worst of the Ballarat mining
people is that they are always on the float.
* * * *
Questions put to the A 1 Gaffney’s
Board why the yield from the amalgam
reserve, wasn’t reported in Melbourne have
not cleared up the mystery of its existence.
Manager Friel avows he wrote to the head
office on April 10 that he had banked the
gold. If that be so, is his letter stuck up
in the dead-letter office? If not, who has it?
* * * *
This shows how the yields from Edna
May Central (W.A.) are moving:—
Tons. Value. Costs.
January .. 2015 £2OOO £1335
February .. 1981 1864 1279
March ' .. 2100 1885 1488
April .. 2077 1700 1640
Costs are impressively low, being under
the 16s. mark, even reckoning in heavy dead
work; but with tougher country to work
and heavier pumping expenses, present
crushings won’t make .the office very fat.
“Disillusionised” (W.A.) : Re Edna May
and its satellites. A new power plant has
been ordered for the big mine, and admirers
reckon that an additional 10 head of stamps
will shortly be installed, dividends nearly
doubled, and the shares put up to £l2 or
£l5. The co. is getting ready to crosscut
for the reef at No. 4 level, and does not
intend, as generally supposed, to take the
shaft down to No. 5 level before opening
out. Some critics rail against the manage-
ment for not winzing simultaneously with
shaft sinking, but the water is too trouble-
some for that. The putting out of the No.
4 crosscut will probably harden the market,
and may also influence speculation in
Deeps, as the position of the reef in Edna
May ground at No. 4 level is bound to throw
a good deal more light on the Deeps chances
at depth. The Deeps shaft is now down
200 ft., and no great difficulty is likely to be
experienced in going below 300 ft. unless
the Edna May stops sinking at the No. 4
level, in which case the expense of un-
watering the country, which now rests upon
the Edna May, may press heavily on the
Deeps.
Blaek Range Binnacles Do. has handed
over the purchase consideration of £5OOO
cash and 40(H) paid shares for its new West-
ralian property, and will erect machinery
right away. About 800 tons of broken ore
await treatment-
« * * *
Adelaide Enterprise (W.A.) is run by an
optimistic crowd. At the recent half-yearly
meeting shareholders were told that pros-
pects were favorable; and a director iater
on “expressed pleasure at what he had
seen.” The average of the last crushing of
230 tons would, it is argued, give a fail-
profit; if the mill could be kept running con-
tinuously; but unfortunately for want of
ore of the same grade it can’t, and that is
the whole trouble.

A co. of 100,000 £1 shares has been
formed in Melbourne by Lionel Robinson,
Clark and friends to work a big alluvial
patch at Nullagine (W.A.). One section is
estimated to contain two million yards of
Is. 6d. dirt, and another section half a mil-
lion yards of 3s. 6d. stuff. A big area still
remains to be tested, but what has already
been proved is considered good enough to
make a start on. Some diamonds, includ-
ing one of 31 carats, were got in boring, and
the promoters are hopeful of saving a lot
more when operations are in full swing.
* * * *
Tindals (W.A.) wants more help. This
time six months’ exemption is sought on
three grounds —work done, money spent,
and want of funds. It would save time
and money if the co. got perpetual exemp-
tion and shut down altogether. The show
was never good enough to warrant the out-
lay of the money that has been expended
on it already.
Great Unknown, at Marda (W.A.), has
been optioned for £2OOO cash and 10,000
paid shares in a prospective Melbourne co.
by Tricks. The show is mostly owned by
D. L. Doolctte and Charlie Jones, and is
said to be full of possibilities. Investors
should require good reports after a search-
ing overhaul. They should also remember
that what is taken out of a mine is no
guide to what is in it, especially when the
district has not much of a reputation for
permanency.

Sinking is being rushed on the recently
floated Gibraltar lease (W.A.) to cut the
reef at 50ft. A Bulletin man who knows
the district well has no hesitation whatever
in predicting a short life.
Golden Bole’s liquidation first and final
div. is expected at Kalgoorlie to be one

Brilliant Extended, Charters Towers,
made a profit of £ll6O last month, and
shareholders are looking forward to another
distribution before long. A sixpenny costs
£6250, and one dividend of that amount has
been paid this year. But there are no
reserves of stone worth mentioning.
.** * *
Mills United, Charters Towers, closed its
half-year on April 14 with £IO,OOO in cash ;
so it can afford to poke about. It has
bought Pfeiffer’s lease and part of the old
Day Dawn P.C., and now proposes to drive
a crosscut from Mills’ vertical shaft at
3214 ft. to explore for the patchy Talisman
reef. During the half-year 6938 tons were
crushed for £24,104. But only a little of
this was on the co.’s own account, for the
old Day Dawn workings have been employ-
ing 156 tributors, who paid £2989 in
royalty. Still, Mills doesn’t get fat on
that, for after paying exes, (pumping, haul-
ing, crushing, etc.) there was only £213 to
the good.
* * * *
Chairman Pigott, who runs Mount Cuth-
bert (Q.), mainly on behalf of the Powers
and their allies, is out with a loan pros-
pectus for £70,000 of 7 per cent, debentures.
This is the second time he has turned the
tap on in this way, and he makes the date
of redemption (June, 1922) synchronise with
that of the first issue. There is the same
right to convert into shares as attached to
the first issue of £70,000. To allow for this
right the co. will be enlarged from 240,000
to 300.000 shares of £1 each. As the mine
position has been helped by developments at
the Kalkadoon lease, the security is doubt-
less right; but the obstacle to an issue
at par is that the bonds of the present 7
per cent, issue can be bought in the market
for under 90.
* if * *
St. Mungo (Cloncurry). whose dazzling
little figures were quoted last week, hands
out another sixpenny dividend (£1000).
Profits on the sale of high-grade ore to the
Hampden are very sweet at present. Re-
cently 97 tons were bagged and despatched
in a fortnight. The value of that lot was
£922, while expenses amounted to only
£375. The shaft is down 280 ft. on the con-
tact of granite and schist. The peculiarity
of the mine is that lateral deposits of high-
grade ore occur at intervals, and when
these flat makes are worked out the co. has
to root about in search of other deposits.
There are 40,000 shares, nominally of 2s.
Od. each, so the Gd. dividend is equal to
20 p.c. The concern was floated in 1909,
and has long since returned its moderate
paid-up capital (£5000). Charters Towers
still holds most of the shares.
* * *- *
Mount T.yoll gets on to the dividend list
again with a shilling, payable on .Tune 15.
For the half-year ended March 31 secretary
Dave Lumsdon announces profits of £98,220,
apparently after £IS,24G has been set by
for depreciation and £4622 for prospecting
and development. It is a year since the
last dividend was forthcoming. so. share-
holders won’t object to the stiffening the
div. will give to their holdings.

A
WOMAN’S
LETTER
Sydney, May 10, 1915.
M y Dear Arini, —
The State Premiers’ confab, opened in our
worst weather, with heavy rain swishing
down Macquarie-street. In consequence the
plumage of the ladies in the Council Cham-
ber was mostly of the top-coat order. One
waistcoat (feminine) made a stately progress
to the leather chairs reserved for the mighty.
It was dull drab, and worn by a comfortable-
looking dame who followed in the wake of
Mrs. David Hall’s blue drapery.
Prime Minister Fisher contrived to get a
word or two into the pink lobe which Miss
Mary Strickland turned his way, while Mrs.
1 lolman, who looked quite capable of running
the meeting herself, chatted into the Com-
monwealth chieftain’s disengaged ear. Premier
Holman, having been elected president of
the show, hurled his resonant voice at the
meeting, and suggested that it “do now wait”
the coming of his Ex. —a. distractiugly punc-
tual man who is always level with the clock
when he doesn’t beat it. In the brief wait
the company hurriedly took stock of its
friends and enemies, and the Peacock im-
proved the occasion by screeching into the
silence. The Victorian politician is rounder
and more sleek than of yore, and his optim-
istic smile (already mentioned) is less like a
rip-saw. Still, even now it is easily located.
After its first outbreak the other day a
startled voice was heard to say “There it
goes!” as if it were a firebell.
To the tick of time his Ex., attended by
General Finn, in full armor, and Secretary
Budge, in mere civilian togs, mounted the
rostrum, delivered his address, and settled
down in the horsehair seat of judgment. The
well-tubbed Victorian Attorney-General Mac-
kinnon was at this time shrined near the
Peacock fire-alarm. Further along, Tas-
manian delegate Lyons showed a thick shock
of brown hair standing on end like the
bristles of a doormat. Next to him was his
brand-new bride, a pretty girl with fit Ify
locks blown by a rude, rough wind. On the
other side, J. D. Fitzgerald’s spectacles
flashed in a stray gleam of sunshine.
The most stirring speech at this opening
meet was made by a Westralian politician,
whom everybody spoke of as Tommy
Walker. After allowing this orator —who
looks like a well-baked churchwarden—to
harrow my feelings with his beautifully-
rounded remarks re the Empire and Aus-
tralian heroes, it was maddening to find that
he is a professional harrower, so to speak.
Certainly, he can still throw Deep Feeling
into his elocution with great effect. Even
the stern countenances of the Trades Hall
ladies, Mrs. Kate Dwyer and a Miss Golding
or two (out to watch Premier Holman, and
not inclined to stand any nonsense), softened
while the melted butter fell from the lips of
the erstwhile representative of the New-
castle miners. So well preserved is he
that you would never think he was a hard-
ened politician who was in the habit of
annoying old Henry Parkes years and years
before the Labor party was born—and that
is a quarter of a century ago.
Papua’s Excellency, Judge Murray, has
passed this way en route to Melbourne. His
son, who was badly wounded in an arm, is
now back in the scrimmage. Young Murray,
taking after father in the matter of length,
stands about 6ft. oin. in his knitted socks.
His rifle had jarnbed after accounting for
six of the enemy at close quarters when his
own close call came along.
Miss Soubeiran, lion. sec. of the French
Australian League of Help, asks me to
thank many anonymous friends outback
who have responded to her Bulletin
appeal tor bread-money for her suffering
compatriots. The French lady’s eloquence
stirred Bill and Jim from their accustomed
calm to forward contributions from places
of which the ordinary map has no cogni-
sance. Hence the grateful thanks of the
Demoiselle Soubeiran —herself an orphan of
the Franco-Prussian war.
Some of this Australian bread-money was
cabled to Mayor Hawke, of Vauxbaun,
close by the battered remains of Soissons.
Curiously enough, the French mayor is an
Australian, born in Sydney when Hawke,
senior, was in the wine firm of Curcier,
Adet. Of an English family, long settled
in France, the Australian son has been, like
all provincial Maires, the official father of
his little town of Vauxbaun, now a ruined
monument to Kultur. His present task is
to try to make one loaf feed many mouths.
And not always only their own mouths
either. In the North of France 40.000
families, themselves poor, have already each
adopted a Belgian orphan to bring up with
their own brood.
Dr. Jock Morton, of Macquarie-street,
goes to the usual address by the Mooltan.
Mrs. Jock travels with him as far as Lon-
don.
Mrs. Fred Lassetter, who used to be
Elsie Antill, of Picton, is happily reported
amongst the saved from the Lusitania hor-
ror. So is her only surviving son, Fred.
He was wounded, as you remember, in the
Big Fight, and was returning to England
accompanied by mother after a health trip
this way.
Froliman, the leading American
theatrical manager, amongst the dead in
the Lusitania disaster, was the husband of
the almost equally well-known Maude
Adams —the IJ.S.A. Bernhardt. They have
one son, of 11 or thereabouts.
Governor Strickland assisted at the open-
ing of the new Conservatorium of Music on
a grey afternoon last week. His Ex. would
much rather examine the inwards of a
steam engine than listen to the blare of an
orchestra. Still, he bore up during the
musical items, and flung his remarks con-
cerning industry as an aid to musical pro-
ficiency into the interval. Then, apologis-
ing for his profound ignorance of the subject
on which he had to talk, he pulled aside his
coat-tails and sat down.
Someone dropped threepence on the floor
at this juncture. After it had been pursued
and returned to its owner, business pro-
ceeded. Minister for Education Griffith
and his predecessor, Carmichael, chortled
with glee at the consummation of the scheme
for converting the mews into a hotbed of
art. They have reason to be pleased, any-
how, with the perfect acoustics of the con-
cert hall. We are accustomed to so much
echo in other Sydney halls that the relief is
great.
Unfortunately Amy Castles was ill with
bronchitis, so Ella Caspers had the great
opportunity. Her really beautiful voice
fell like notes of velvet in this exquisitely
sensitive cave of music. But her cold inter-
pretation invariably estranges her audiences.
Conductor Bradley unwisely chose, for his
orchestra, Elgar’s long and massive Sym-
phony in A flat. Two movements of it are
about 14 sizes too large for the small
Conservatorium. Some of those present
looked as if wads of cotton wool might have
abated their anguish. Alfred Hill, far more
attractive _in his methods of conducting,
opened with such a brilliant orchestral
attack on the National Anthem that he
lifted it into the realms of a serious com-
position. He led his fiddlers through the
Beethoven “Dedication of the House.” This,
chosen for its title, began the musical pro-
gramme ; the “Mastersinger” ended it. Arun-
del Orchard had to lead his orchestra
through the latter composition in a half-
empty house, Elgar’s big blare having eaten
up too much of the short afternoon.
The National Council knitted with un-
abated ferocity wdiile Dr. Mackellar ad-
dressed the gathering on the Boy who Took
the Wrong Turning. The meeting, which
was at Government House, heard with start-
eyes the horrors of the child-convict
system. The Bad Boy of the Family, even
as late as the. middle of the 19th century,
was first whacked by the Law for his own
backsliding. He was then deported—for
further whackings—to Tasmania, because
he had chosen his parents so unwisely that
he was better away from their patch of
earth.
(( A recent press mention of a picture by
“Mr.” Hodgkins having been hung bv the
Royal Academy probably refers to
artist, Miss Frances Hodgkins. For the
time being she has given up her big classes
in Paris, and is working in the Cornish
village of St. Ives. This picturesque town,
as you know, is noted for its artists’ colony
and its early-Victorian drainage. They
recently had their annual exhibition, in
which the Hodgkins pictures were admired
tor their bold and brilliant color schemes.
W hen her work was here, a couple of years
er so ago, it caused considerable discussion,
t o the older cult of artists it was danger-
ously near the Futurist whirlpool. Aus-
tralian Modernists, however, like color, and
are not afraid to look at a bright green tree
under a sapphire sky.
Young Champion, who was badly wounded
m the recent dash for the Turks’ fez, is a
son of parson Champion, for a while
dominie of the King’s School, and now the
shepherd who tends Anglican souls in the
dusty Canberra area that the present Gov-
ernment is said to be so tired of.
This time it seems safe to mention August
5 as the date of Melba’s flight to the United
States. The songstress has decided to cut
L/ondon out of her present programme, and
lingers on this side to help raise money
t? ,? a , se Jke pains of battered Europe. Her
1 olish Relief concert in Sydney Town Hall
13 dated J une 3. The next event
after that will be the lied Cross
concert in Hobart on June 30. A
similar raid on Launceston is suggested
for early in July. The Voice will then take
two bars’ rest before catching the boat for
’Frisco. A fortnight’s stay at Honolulu may
possibly be the occasion of another trill.
An Australian in London says that it’s
manners not to peer at the drilling of new
recruits. “For this reason,” she says, “I
do not know whether George Lambert really
was drilling the Artists’ Corps the other
day in the courtyard of the Royal Academy.
But the stentorian words of command were
certainly very like Lambert’s.”
The beautiful Alice Coles, one of this
month’s handsomest brides, was married (in
torrents of rain, by the way) to Judge
Roseby, of the New Hebrides Mixed'
Court. The tall bride is a daughter of Mr.
and Mrs. Henry Coles, of this hamlet.
Mamma used to be Miss Pierce, and her
good looks were admired in Melbourne some
years ago. In spite of the weeping skies,
the bridal party kept dry shod, even in the
marquee on the parental grass-plot. For
once a tented covering behaved itself and
didn’t shed its overflow down the bride-
groom’s back. Speeches were brief. Dr.
Roseby, uncle of the groom—a cleric much
given to inquiring into the habits of stars —
made the most impressive address. The
bridal finery had as its foundation the
satin frock in which the owner made her
curtsey to Queen Mary a couple of years
ago. Over this was a foam of diaphanous
drapery and gossamer lace. The brides-
maiden, in blush pink, was Miss Scott, a
cousin of the heroine. Parson “Bob”
McKeown, who has lent several tall sons to
help Our Friends, tied the knot.
Lieut. Pat Anderson, reported killed in the
Gallipoli struggle, belonged to a squatting
family in the New England district. Two
cousins, the Cox brothers, who died of pneu-
monia in Egypt, were in the same regiment.
The pretty Mrs. Leonard Dangar, who used
to be Mary Anderson, is a sister
France, with the smiling approval of her
ally across the Channel, decorated nine Eng-
lish officers. with the Legion of Honor the
other morning. Among them were three
Generals commanding army corps, a colonel
of the general staff, and French’s staff, in-
cluding Colonel F. E. Guest, one of the Field-
Marshal’s A.D.C’s.— the youngest brother of
Lady Chelmsford, who passed the cake at
Sydney Government House before the Strick-
lands arrived with their nursery.
Soprano Eva Gauthier, who warbled
sweetly here a while ago, was recently sing-
ing in New York. She says that after the
war (what a lot of things are going to
happen then!) she means to go back to
Java, and gather up a Javanese concert co.
to tour Europe and the U.S.A. The
Canadian songbird, who is a niece of Wil-
fred Laurier, seems to be looking for a
strenuous time.
Pianist Pintel, whose brilliant attacks
on a concert grand during Calve’s tour were
peaceful interludes in the tragic Emma’s
storms of emotion, again makes liis bow
to Sydney audiences. His recital in St.
James’s Hall the other night was an artistic
triumph. Small and boyish-looking, and
fascinating in the Chopin and Schumann
items, he cannot achieve the musical thun-
der of Bauer, who had the strong right arm
of a village blacksmith. He belongs rather
to the Leonard Berwick cult —a poet-
pianist, who, nevertheless, can hit out hard
enough when Wagner is under his thumb.
His worst trouble —one rare among
musicians. —is his modesty. If he will cease
to hide his light behind a baize door, where
he teaches Miss Hairbows, the public, which
takes its politicians and its pianists very
much at their own valuation, ought to rush
a series of his recitals.
Artist Lister Lister’s big spread of can-
vas was opened by James Fairfax in
Anthony Horderns’ Gallery. Except for a
couple of friends, this collection of 72 oils
and water-colors is new. The Art Society’s
chief has scoured Illawarra, the Hawkes-
bury, the Blue Mountains, the Northern
Rivers and the Harbor foreshores for scenic
beauty. The gem of the show is 100
guineas’ worth of Harbor view in oils. In
this picture Lister has escaped from him-
self. The soft haze on the water and the
blurred distance of North Head in the
glow of a summer evening are achievements
apart from the artist’s usual attention to
detail.
Along with the same expansive smile,
Nella Webb has brought back from the
U.S.A. to the Tivoli a remarkable collection
of new clothes. How she gets into some
of the gossamer duds is a trade secret no
vaudeville star ever tells her press agent.
There is a pale pink frock like a fluted
cloud, for instance. This is a neck-to-
ankle garment, but the top part is a pro-
found mystery. Apparently it is woven on
to Nella’s plump shoulders. Then it drops
a stitch and floats off by itself in sleeves
and a wide flared skirt. It is a lovely slice
of illusion, and the getting out of it in a
hurry would probably create a heavenly
ruin.
Belgian Day—Friday, May 14 —looms up
ay the biggest effort of its kind this c-ity
has organised for the relief of Albert’s bat-
tered kingdom. The matinee at Her
Majesty’s, though really a huge affair, is
only a speck in the campaign. A special
cafe will feed the lady highwaymen in Daw-
son and Little’s old auction rooms in I'itt-
street. Donations of flowers, cigars and
refreshments—in short, loot of any sort you
can lay your hands on —will be accepted
with acclamation at the United Charities’
office, Q.Y. Markets.
Wahroonga is spinning its web to catch
any coin left over from Belgian Day. On
May 15 the leafy suburb will have an ex-
tensive fete in the local recreation ground,
and the lady highlanders thereabouts will
fight in tennis and croquet tournaments till
nightfall.
The Art Students repeat their tableaux in
aid of the Soldiers’ Club fund. “The Awak-
ening of Australia,” you are reminded, will
appeal to you at the Bepertory Theatre on
Saturday evening, May 15.
Artist Alice Muskett sends Julian Ashton
a glowing picture of Thea Proctor’s camp in
old Chelsea. Her studio was once the bar
of an ancient inn, the Palmerston Arms.
The bow window makes a fine alcove hung
with blue curtains. Decorations are in blue
and dull gold. “In the midst was
the artist, wearing blue, and _ looking
beautiful. Two check silk cushions on
the big couch caught my eye. They
reminded me of a box of patches
my mother used to give me as a great treat
when I was a little girl. Thea explained
they were made from a silk dress of her
grandmother’s, so the connection in my
mind with long-ago things was solved.” The
old hostel houses a cosy group of women
workers. So the Mosman girl is not alone
with the ghosts of bygone Chelsea thirsts.
Alice Muskett, by the way, is dabbling in
water-colors —a digression from her oil tubes.
Mary Marlowe, the Australian girl who
appeared in “On Our Selection” three years
or so back, sends a cooee from N’York. A
few weeks ago she was playing there in
“Tipperary” as the “sweetest girl.” She
says that the Emden affair made some of
her TT.S. acquaintances realise for the first
time that Austria was not the same country
as Australia. As the just-returned Douglas
Mawson says, 100 per cent, of the U.S. navy
may be pro-British; all the same, at the
moment of writing Mary Marlowe said the
officers of the enemy cruiser Prince Eitel
Frederick were being dined and wined by
U.S.A. naval men.
Miss Bruton, the Westralian nurse who
had such thrilling experiences early in the
war, notably in a field hospital run by in-
experienced British peeresses, is now acting-
matron at Hampstead General Hospital.
Two Sydney artists, the sisters Cusack,
are still in England. They are helping Bel-
gian refugees when they first sink exhausted
with terror and fatigue on British soil.
Later, the girls are going to gently break
the news that they have adopted one or two
distressful infants “for keeps.” As they
don’t depend on brush work for a crust,
baby Liege will have a meaty bone to pick.
Since the war has clipped artists’ earn-
ings, some Sydney men are sitting up to
take notice of the fat Felton bequest in
Melbourne. This helps to bring the Vic-
torian trustees’ spending power up to £BOOO
a year. Yet not a penny of the Felton
money has come the way of the men who
have set up their easels in N. S. Wales.
Here, on the other hand, with a fluctuating
income of about £2OOO per annum, the trus-
tees have spent, in all, something like £3OOO
on the efforts of Victorian artists.
In “The Man Who Stayed at Home,” the
girls who stayed there, too, temporarily for-
get the horrors of war in the joy-rags of
more peaceful times. Violet Paget, as
Miriam Lee, who helps the secret-service
man to unmask enemy spies, bolsters up the
Empire in a succession of dream clothes.
The best evening gown, of white satin, is
mostly a delicious skirt with a long panel
behind. This starts on one shoulder and
ends in a tail on the floor. There is a
corsage, to be sure, but it is inconspicuous,
and as substantial as a drapery of dew-
drops. Pretty Lizette Parkes* the girl who
wants her young man to go to the w T ar,
weeps if she thinks he may be induced to
take this awful step. She dries her tears
in the last act, not on. hut in a frivolous
white five-decker frock with white satin
ribbons dangling over it. The Donald
Mackinnons, of Melbourne, were in the
audience at the Royal the other night. Mrs.
Donald, a sister of artist Rupert Bunny, is
plump and good to look at.
The wider skirt area is now frilled by
pleats from the waist of the coat. This
baggage is fairly heavy to move about in
if it be made of winter suiting. The hard,
precipitous wall of black velvet millinery
that tops this gear is not to be rushed by
ladies who have (reluctantly) turned their
back on 40 summers.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELOBURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, May 10, 1915.
My Dear Yarrie, —
Clement Wragge drops a line from Birk-
enhead, Auckland, to say that he didn’t
write back “Ten guineas, please,.: to .be
Australian squatter who sent to him for a
weather forecast, and he didn t advise No
real rains till June’ when the 10 guineas
came to hand. Then why didn t he? It our
old friend Inclement can make a long-dis-
lance forecast which is fairly accurate even
two times out of three, it would pay scores
of Australians to give him 500 guineas for
it, Ihe hornble pait of the business iiom
the squatters point of view would be to get
in return for the money the news that there
was another two or three months drought
ahead. But, still again, why not charge for
that? The doctor sends in his bill even if
he does have to tell you that you’ve got
heart disease. I am certainly not going to
gibe at any scientist for sending in his bill,
Most times he is such a soft-head where
money is concerned that he finds out things
and is satisfied with the glory while some
commercial shark gets away with the profit.

Captain Balpli Verney has been wounded.
ion will remember his visits to Melbourne
in the dead past, in the train of (lie Mac-
gregor, of Queensland ; Lord Chelmsford, ol
N. S. M ales; and other Governors. lie is
married to a daughter of ex-Sena tor Walker,
and is accordingly a brother-in-law of the
famous \\ alker twins.
Bobert Parker gave two matinee recitals
during last week and Melba was at both of
them. She has made quite a hobby of
Parker. Enveloped as to the head in a won-
derful hat of embroidered rose-petals, and
muffled to the ears in polar furs, she waved
her handkerchief at the gifted singer when
she was not clapping. Four other members
of her party, who might also have been polar
bears, emitted wild sounds of joy from the
depths of their furs at brief intervals. Mrs.
Charlie I.empriere came in late, and the
white wings in her hat stood up like the
quills of some pale, breathless porcupine,
There were others; but can you blame me
when I own that my eyes were riveted on
Parker? He is wonderful. He opens his
mouth wider in his Wagner numbers than

ten creatures lacking utterly in imagination
and romance carpers and quidnuncs—m
bnef, my dear, oui local Concert-going
Nuisances—say that certain of his baritone
notes should be taken with the mouth closed.”
But my answer is: I arker is a genius, and
to genius all things are permitted. Many ot
our fairest girls have gone absolutely dippy
about Parker. They come to his concerts
and yearn, and he responds with wildly senti-
mental songs, rendered in a suppressed
voice, what time he gazes severely through
his glasses at the yearners.
“ „ , ’ * .
Ihe Ravages concert in aid of the Bel-
gians earned a lot of money at 2s. 6d. a
lime. It was a uniformly well-groomed
house; in fact, despite the Complete Ab-
sence of Governor people, I should be
within bounds in calling it Smart. The
recently-returned Chief Justice made a toil-
ing speechlet, which was listened to by his
wife in a red concert cloak that may have
been plush. I am guarded on this point, as
a legal friend tells me that a prima donna
once recovered damages from a paper which
said that she habitually wore plush and ate
onions. To resume, Belgian Consul-General
Lauwers sat among the Madden party. (His
wife was away ill.) Also Mr. and Mrs.
Consul Yanderlcelen and Vice-Consul Valcke
and his wife. Dolores was with the Balwyn
Beid girls. Amongst the multitude I ob-
served Dr. “Bill” Aitken, who is shortly
leaving for the Front. Miss Bea Weston
Pett presented the Madden lady and the
Consular dames with bouquets of red and
pink roses.
The perfoimeis were all Sai ages or rel a-
fives of Savages, and they. acquitted them-
selves nobly. Ihe most oiiginal featuie ol
a lengthy programme ivas the final item a
Hymn ot Hate, composed by Horace Gleeson
and sung by a ferocious band of mock Ger-
mans. At the end of it a small boy, dressed
as a British Jar, and carrying a Union Jack,
ad\ anced from the. back of the hall to the
music of Buie Britannia. V hereupon the
miserable Teutons fled panic-smitten from
the platform, and bolted round the organ loft
and generally behaved 111 a degraded manner,
while the,Tar (mounting the steps from the
feet of the Madden party) planted his Union
Jack triumphantly on the stage.
“The Trojan Women” duly occurred in
lhe Athenaeum on Saturday night. John
Dawson conducted Marshall Hall’s music,
which was performed by a hidden orchestra.
The composer sat in the limelight in the
second row of the stalls and kept as quiet
as though he had been gagged. He hardly
uttered one of those Jovian Bravas of his
during the whole show. The Women
looked nice, though some of their gowns
savored of fancy-dress ball-frocks built by
suburban dressmakers. The most taking
garment of the lot, to my mind, was that of
hose Quong Andromache, ihe htage lights

social reporter . Helen of Troy (Miss

Helen was handsome, so the classicists all
aggnre me—the sort of imposing beauty
that elderly gentlemen describe with im-

The Duchess who wedded the late Nick
Fitzgeralds youngest son has decided to
be known as Lady Millicent Fitzgerald,
be change will not be officially notified
until after neace settles over the Lnited
Kingdom. then the tremendous announce-
uient will be more felt.
At a tea-party which I attended lately a
lady barrister gave all of us the horrors,
and sev eral of us the blind staggers, by an-
nouncing placidly that when the war ended
ovor y man would have to marry seven wives,
gj, e then proved it by simple equations and
logarithms. Imagine dividing Paris models
wb h seven other females! Warming to her
W ork, she next proclaimed that even the
unmarried woman would soon be recog-
nised as a possible factor in providing popu-
lation—her legal way of stating that Mary
Ann who Did would no longer be given the
sack and the address of a Foundling Home,
but would be acclaimed as a patriot and the
savior of her country.

Th e fight on the Dardanelles has hit S. Aus. hard.
Amongst the lost are Captain W. Strachan, an ex-
Adelaidean who lias been living in Victoria for some
time, and joined from that State. He was recently
married to Miss Alice Campbell, of North Adelaide,
Colonel Fox-Clarke was married just before the
left Tasmania to Miss Moffatt, of Adelaide, a grand-
daughter of old Dr. Hinton. Amongst the wounded
are the Frank Fishers’ only son and one of the
Teesdale Smiths. Major S. B. Robertson, a Queens-
lander who has been killed, was here for some years
while his father was at Stow Church,
Incidentally, the bloodthirsty clamor of the news-
boys is to be stilled. Two of them were fined for
needless howling, on Thursday, before the State
Children’s Court.
Our veterans sparred up nobly for the Governor’s
motor-ambulance fund. ,In less than a month they
have contributed £73so—enough to provide 14 ambu-
lances. R. Barr Smith and Syd. Kidman gave each
enough for four, and George Brookman and Josiali
Symon each paid for one. The Red Cross Sock League
sent over a thousand pairs of the articles in which
the members specialise; the local branch of the
Navy League is making a further appeal for funds;
and the Servian Fund has already passed the £BOO
Meanwhile other things go on as usual. Clara
g erena > s two concerts filled the Town Hall, and left
a genera i impression on the public that Melba’s pro-
pbeCy as to the young woman’s future fame was
going to conie true. -<* r
James Ashton is well enough to say that he means
to be present at the annual exhibition of the Society
0 f Arts—of which he is president—on Thursday. The
ghow is to be open till May 29, and on the previous
da y there will be a ' sale of pictures, given by the
ai . t ists, in aid of the Belgian relief fund. There are
35 canvases, ranging in price from £25 downwards,
Percy Magarey, who is to be sergeant compounder
to the Third General Hospital, has left for Sydney,
He was managing director of Birks Chemists, Ltd.,
and one of a big Adelaide clan that mingles medicine
and 1,01 ir -
F. M. Cutback, at one time a member of the Regis-
TEIS stafl > who came out as official recorder with the
Australian fleet, is at the Front with the British
I{ °T al Field Artillery. His people are at Renmark,
but he went direct from London to Europe. Two of
the Chaffeys, whose people were so closely associated
with the early days of the irrigation settlements, are
serving with the Canadians, their father, C. F. Chaffey,
being now in Vancouver.
Eric Talbot Smith, the first South Australian officer
to be killed in the war, was son of The Bulletin’s
dramatic critic in Adelaide, and grandson of the
veteran philanthropist, Edwin Smith. The boy—he
seems to have died on his 23rd birthday—was one
of the original students when the military college at
Duntroon was opened, and was reputed one of the
brightest young officers it has turned out.
Singer A. C. Bartleman, with a brigade
of pupils some 15 strong, ran a concert in
the New Assembly Hall on Saturday night.
The place is really a Scotehbyterian kirk,
and how it endured the purely secular
revels that occurred in its holy interior I
found it hard to realise. Bartleman comes
from Bendigo, where he used to be known
by the unromantic name of Alfred Bot-
toms, you may remember, lie has a Voice
worth mentioning, and, moreover, he seems
to know how to teach others to use what
they have got. One youthful student, Doris
Paseoe, who was arrayed in blameless white
muslin and pink roses, gave a “Madame
Butterfly” selection remarkably well, and
in the sweetest of tones. Hattenbach ’cel-
loed, and about a dozen other students’
items thronged the programme.
The Yarra Yarra Golf Club opened offi-
cially for the season on Saturday afternoon.
The chief event of the day was a pair of
Ma-Mie-Rosette silk stockings, giddily frisk-
ing out of two knee-high slits in a fawn
skirt. Ask any man the score for that day
and it is odds on that he’ll murmur “cerise
knees” or “pink ankles.” She played golf,
too, the shy little soul. Mrs. Willie Nunn
wore a neat grey cloth coat and tight-fitting
toque. The Charlie Tails were there in
appropriate disguises. Mrs. Mcßoberts, in
navy-blue tight covers, helped people to sur-
round the tea and cake. There were others
—crowds of them —but their illustrious
names have momentarily slipped my memory.
The Ffrench (two F’s if you please) sol-
dier boy who has been wounded in the Dar-
danelles is a nephew of the recently-widowed
Mrs. Robert Power. His youngest brother
Murragh leaves shortly for the Front.
Mrs. Henry Stead commandeered a pri-
vate room at the Oriental for her good-bye
party to Mrs. Elwood Mead. Americans
wore thick in the crowd, and melodious cries
of “Waal, naow, if that doan’t beat the
hand!” “Do tell!” and the like dominated
the proceedings. If I hadn’t providentially
remembered to bring my chewing-gum I
should have felt quite lost. Dolores was
there enveloped in furs; also, of course, her
companion, Mrs. Vairdot. The guest of the
evening was tailored to great perfection.
The hostess appeared in cute black velvet,
and you know how black velvet shows up
pale auburn hair. Belgian Consul Lauwers
was there, too ; also Mr. and Mrs. Commis-
sioner Downs, of the U.S., and everybody
stayed until the very end and had a
thoroughly jolly and gloomy time.
Dr. Mai’y Henderson is off to a Base Hos-
pital somewhere or other with Dr. Bell.
They are booked to sail this week. Did I
mention that they were married first?
The Webb-Lorimer effort brought £3O to
the Victoria Hospital for Women, and
another £3O to the Red Cross Fund. The
money was earned by the Open-Air Culture
girls, who exercise on top of the highest
roof in Melbourne.
The budding divas of the Fritz Hart Con-
servatorium were thrown into a violent panic
the other day by the news that Lady Helen
Ferguson was coming with Melba to hear
them sing. They have got used to Melba,
who often drifts in; but to have the daughter
of a marquis and the wife of a Caledonian
Governor-General picking their Art to pieces
was over the odds, my dear.
Norman Hodges, who married Vanda
Clarke the other day, is going to drive a
motor-ambulance in France. He is an old
hand at motoring. Most of our gilded
youths go to France, by the way, in prefer-
ence to Turkey, where the mere Australian
is fighting. Is it the food, or the proximity
to London or the fact that the Turk isn’t
respectable ?
Margot Watson was married to Captain
Murdoch Mackay, of Bendigo, the other day.
After food at the Savoy and a week-end
honeymoon, he rushed back to Broadmeadows.
Two Green Dandies—-Harry Graham and
Dorothy Manning —were quietly married
the other day at St. George’s, Malvern.
The bride is the daughter of the E. B. Man-
nings (Mrs. Manning was the Florence
Harcourt of the original Brough and
Boucicault Co., to which hubby also be-
longed), and the bridegroom, who is
Graham on the hill, was knotted under the
name of Harry Thomas Cranfield, son of
Stephen Cranfield, of Bournemouth (Eng.),
where the bombs drop.
Mrs. Ross Soden gave a f§te at Grong
Grong, her Most Expensive Tooraketty
house, in aid of a branch of the Red Cross
sewing society. There were tennis and
croquet tournaments (with pieces of valu-
able Satsuma as prizes) and crystal-gazing
and palmistry and I don’t know what else.
As a sop to the cultured section there was
a concert in the ballroom (a chastely sim-
ple interior contrived by Hugh Patterson),
and, for the others, tea in the garden. The
garden is lovely, and is personally weeded,
hoed, snailed, grubbed and wormed by the
hostess every morning.
Senator Pearce rather “lost his block”
last week. The names of killed and
wounded soldiers were dribbling slowly
through, and an anxious crowd swarmed
outside the newspaper offices and demanded
more news. Pearce said scornfully: “They
cannot get results like football scores.
There is no half-time in war. War goes
on all the time, and the gates do not close
ac six.” All true, no doubt, but rather
unnecessary. When people have just heard
from one of those weird liars who are so
frequent nowadays that their son or brother
is “unofficially reported killed” their thirst
for further information is not bounded by
cold logic. By the way, how about some
legal penalty commensurate to the offence
of promulgating false war news of this
sort?
The Very Rev. Dean of Melbourne is call-
ing people to a meeting at the Town Hall
this week to discuss that which
begins inside your own gate. For ex-
ample, the Babies’ Home at Middle
Brighton. Anyone who wishes to give this
most deserving of institutions a lift should
get into touch with Mrs. Royston Davey,
who is secretary.
Joan Urquhart, whose people inhabit
Moondah, in the Western District, is to
be married to Alan Calvert, of Irrewarra.
She is a striking-looking girl, with ash-
blonde hair and a tremendous reputation in
flapperdom as an outdoor sportsgirl.
I have always contended, in the very
teeth—aye, and occasionally the gums—of
interested opposition that one of the pret-
tiest flappers in Malvern, if not in Mel-
bourne, is Doris Geddes. And now she is
engaged to a discerning young man of
the astonishing name of George IV. Giddy.
He is a good judge of maidenly loveliness,
and comes from Elsternwick.
The Alderton-White wedding has been
pushed back by sciatica. D is the present
intention of the bridegroom-elect to wrestle
with the enemy in a private hospital for
three months.
Yours sincerely,
JOHANNA.

FRUIT LAXATIVE FOR MAMMA, DAD,
BABY, "CALIFORNIA SYRUP OF FIGS.”
Better than calomel, oil or pills to clean
and regulate liver, bowels and
stomach.
Mother, daddy and the children can always
keep feeling fine by taking this delicious
fruit laxative as occasion demands. Nothing
else cleanses the stomach, liver and bowels
so thoroughly without griping.
You take a little at night and in the morn-
ing all the foul, constipated waste, sour bile
and fermenting food delayed in the bowels
gently moves out of the system. When you
awaken all headache, indigestion, sourness,
foul taste, bad breath, fever and dizziness
are gone; your stomach is sweet, liver and
bowels clean, and you feel grand.
“California Syrup of Figs” is a family
laxative. Everyone from grandpa to baby
can safely take it, and no one is ever disap-
pointed in its pleasant action. Millions of
mothers know that it is the ideal laxative
to give cross, feverish children. Ask your
chemist for a bottle of “California Syrup of
Figs,” which has directions for babies, chil-
dren of all ages, and for grown-ups plainly
on the bottle. Remember there are counter-
feits sold here, so look and see that your
bottle bears the name of “California Fig
Syrup Company. ’ Hand back with contempt
any other fig syrup. “California Syrup of
Ihgs” is sold by all leading chemists, 1/1*
and 1/9.

“Eringa”: At the half-way house the
immigrant from Aberdeen ordered whisky. “Good
stuff that,” said the hairy boss, and reached for the
jug. “Have some water?” “Naw,” replied Aber-
deen ; “A’U hae some whusky.”
“Lagani-N”: “C.F.E.” (B. l/4/’l5)
wants to know if the betel-nut is any relation to the
“betel leaf.’’ It is not. Cattle might possibly knock
some fun out of masticating the fronds of the betel-
nut palm, but man wouldn’t. By “betel leaf’’ I take
it that “C.F.E.” means the leaf of the shrub Macro-
piper methysticum, sometimes known as “pepper
plant.’’ “Betel leaf is quite a misnomer. The fruit
or leaves are invariably chewed with betel-nut and
lime (whenever procurable). It is the action of the
lime that makes the saliva crimson and black-
ens the teeth. According to the Yule Island mis-
sionaries (Papua), a decoction made by boiling down
betel-nuts has proved a cure for dysentery. During
1911 this scourge got going up in Mekeo, and at
Lakekamu the natives were dying like rotten sheep.
At Lakekamu, out of an average native population of
COO, 255 died inside five months, despite that a
medical staff was on the field. There the epidemic
was, of course, dealt with in the orthodox way, i.e.,
starvation and castor oil. At Mekeo, where the
missionaries were left to their own devices, they
depended solely on the betel-nut decoction, and had
conspicuous success. Some of the Lakekamu miners,
having lost confidence in the hospital’s treatment,
resorted to the mission mixture, with better residts.
If a Papuan branch of the Australian Institute of
Tropical Medicine materialises (and director Dr.
Anton Breinl advocates it), this betel-nut cure for
dysentery will be thoroughly investigated.
“Quambone”: Recently I came across an
old document upon which was printed the names of
the committee of the “Institution for the Civilisa-
tion, Care and Education of the Aborigines or Black
Natives of N. S. Wales.” Here they are (numbered
on the document so that no mistake should be made
as to precedence, I suppose) : (1) Ilis Honor Lieu-
tenant-Governor Erskine, President; (2) the Honor-
able Mr. Judge Advocate Wylde; (3) J. T. Camp-
bell, Esq. ; (4) 1). Wentworth, Esq. ; (5) William
Redfern, Esq. ; (6) H. McArthur, Esq. ; (7) the Rev.
Wm. Cowper; (8) the Rev. Henry Fulton; (9) Mr.
Rowland Hassall; (10) Secretary and Treasurer of
the Institution, John Thomas Campbell, Esq.; (11)
Schoolmistress, Mrs. Shelly. That was in Governor
Macquarie’s time —he was patron and Mrs. Mac-
quarie was patroness. I dunno what good came of
the experiment, although I was out investigating at
La Perouse only a few days ago.

“Tiaki’’ There are some hardy annuals in
Maoriland. One of them, a young sprig named James
Seymour, has just completed a bush-whacking con-
tract in the region of Nelson, and is now recreating on
the West Coast. Working as a hatter he has put in
a drive of over 105 ft., and expects to strike pay-dirt
in another 30ft. As he is merely 90 years of age, he
has plenty of time. I was in Masterton when young
John O’Malley applied for the old-age pension. He
admitted that a fellow was liable to become tired of
navvying at 94, but asserted that he wouldn’t have
applied if he had not met with an accident while at
work in a cutting.

“Tsactuo”: Abo. contributors who have
written of native currency in the South Seas have
omitted the mat money of the northern New Hebrides.
These mats are long and narrow and the older and
blacker the more valuable. They are kept in small
houses specially built for their storage, and a smoky
fire is kept going to blacken them. The value is
estimated by the number of folds, which are counted
in tens, and run to 100 fathoms in length. These
mats are principally used to buy rank in the secret
societies. They are lent at interest, but there is no
fixed rate, the lender getting what he can up to 100
per cent. In Santa Cruz a banana fibre is used for
mat money, and this is the only place where a loom
is used.

“Werrimee”: The Darling River always
strikes me as being the River of Rest. No other
stream in N.S.W. is so much favored by the floating
population as a camping place. Besides the occa-
sional holiday-makers and the swagmen and work-
men who spend part of the summer in the bends,
there are whalers and old men who live always
there. These latter shift up and down, though a
few, if wood holds out, stick to the one spot. They
don’t like to see their old river turned into a pleasure
resort. It has been their quiet abiding-place for
years, a peaceful retreat where they could keep
themselves comfortably and do as they pleased. Holi-
day-makers change the aspect of the old home ; they
hunt and fish on what the old whaler has come to
regard as his preserves ; they use up the firewood in
a week that he had estimated would last him a
year. There is plenty of room along the Darling.
But the old hands are not used to town allotments,
or even small paddocks. They have been used to
10-mile blocks, at the least. If they can see the
next house above them, or the next tent below them,
they begin to feel crowded. As yet, the pleasure-
seekers from the north-western corner do not use
much of the river’s great length. If the entire popula-
tion of the corner spread itself along one bank, the old
whaler would still have room to swing his rod
without knocking the next man’s hat off. But he is
looking into the future, when trains will run from
Menindie to Broken Hill, from Bourke to Hunger-
ford, from Cobar to Wilcannia. There are 35,000
people in Broken Hill alone, war time excepted ; rail-
ways, locks and irrigation schemes would plant set-
tlers as thickly on the rich western lands as irrigation
has planted them at Mildura, Renmark and other
places lower down the Murray—areas that were once
regarded as hopeless, and are now great fruit-
producing centres. The land in the North-West will
grow anything; the greater part of it is among the
richest in the Commonwealth. It only wants water,
and the River of Rest will one day supply it, and at
the same time become the busiest pleasure resort
away from the coast. The Old whaler sighs when he
thinks of that time, for the stream that harbors the
black bream and the fat cod will then no longer be
the River of Rest.
“Wandi”: From a dietetic point of view
the pelican and the shag are the most disgusting-
birds oh the water, for what they eat putrifies in
their intestines, and they swarm with worms. The
flesh is coarse and rank. The pelican, with its enor-
mous yellow bill and huge black and white body, is
a conspicuous feature in the waterscape. It is shot
for its fine skin. Its big nest of sticks and herbage
is built on sheltered shores above high-water level.
The eggs, usually two, are yellowish-white. The
bird is easily tamed in the open. There used to be a
flock of 80 in the lagoon at Thylungra (Q.). They
had been quietened by constant feeding from the
kitchen. The bank of the lagoon drops sheer to the
water a few feet from the back door, and the birds
came there regularly at meal-times to feed on the

scraps thrown over by the cook. The Darling- and
Murray rivers used to be great breeding-places of
the pelicans ; also Bulloo Lake, and other large sheets
of water farther west, especially the ’lignum-lined
lagoons of Western Queensland. Though never very
wild, the pelican is a lover of quiet places. Under
the cumbersome-looking- bill there is a deep pouch,
the skin of which is thick, tough and stretchable’
forming a handy food-carrier when there are vora-
cious youngsters to feed. Bushmen assert that it also
carries therein a supply of food and water to sus-
tain it on long flights.

THE OLD PLOUGH.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
’Twas a rough scrub country section, with its fences
old and broken ;
The mallee shoots were waving where the last year’s
scrub was burned ;
All the place seemed broken-hearted, but its saddest
sign and token
Was an old plough worn and battered on the head-
land overturned.
Just a battered old three-furrow, with its three
shares worn and rusted ;
Its beams all strained and twisted as though
wracked by strange disease,
And upon the well-worn axles were rust and grease,
hard crusted,
With dust on hook and eye bolt and on rough-hewn
swingle-trees.
And lush and deep around it the scrub grew thick to
hide it;
By deep-worn, dusty pathways the idle farm stock
pass;
AVith the rope reins as he left them, and the whip
thrown down beside it,
And the tangled trace-chains rusting in the sun-
bleached barley g-rass.
And I vision by the old plough a scene of hasty
parting;
Of youth that clamors “Hurry!” while old lips
whisper “Wait!”
And I see the old eyes staring, through tears, hard
held, yet starting—
Oh, the young hands on the bridle and the old hands
on the gate!
And the old plough lies abandoned while the feet
that tramped beside it
Print deep the tracks of honor in the dust of duty
now;
Where he turns a redder furrow in a greater field
and wider—•
And only Death shall loosen the brown hands from
the plough.

An Unusually Comfortable Car
COMFORT is one of the Over-
land’s most noticeable qualities.
It has been carefully and skilfully
provided in the Overland design.
The seats are wide and deep. The
seat-backs are high. The upholstery
is very thick, and is supported by
springs in which strength and elas-
ticity are perfectly balanced.
The wheel base is long —114 inches
(289.56 cm). The springs are excep-
tionally long. The rear springs are
underslung. Their wide opening
permits great freedom of motion, and
all shocks are absorbed over an area
so great that no unpleasant jars reach
the body. All this is possible because
practically every part of the Overland
is designed and made in the Willys-
Overland factories—under our own
supervision, by our own master work-
men.
To appreciate all of the Overland’s
comfort, you must experience it your-
self. You are invited to inspect the
Overland at the local show-rooms.

FAMOUS FOR HER HAIR.
Actress Tells How to Obtain It.
Madame Hose, tlie well-known American
actress, who is especially noted for her long,
beautiful hair, in a recent interview in
Chicago made the following statement: “Any
lady or gentleman can promote the growth
of their hair and make it soft and glossy
with this simple recipe, which they can mix
at home. To half a pint of water add lox.
of bay rum, a small box of Orlex Compound
and -joz. of glycerine. Apply to the scalp
two or three times a week with the finger-
tips. This is not only the finest liair-grower
I have ever known, but it prevents the hair
from falling out, removes dandruff and scalp
humors, darkens streaked, faded, grey hair
and makes it soft and glossy. The ingredi-
ents can be purchased at any chemist’s at
very little cost.” [XI

“Moana”: There are many ways of
getting a glimpse of Death, and a Hastings (M.L.)
baker has added a new one. While he was working in
his bakehouse a bee got into his throat. The frantic
efforts of the man to dislodge the insect caused it to
sting him. Then a choking baker was dragged to
the local doctor, and Sawbones had to hustle all be
knew to prevent the throat from closing and ending
a, bright career. That baker had a distinct view of
an old man with a scythe waiting by the door.
THE LADY'S DEFENCE.
THE J. P.: “ You are charged -with being drunk
and resisting.”
THE LADY: “ Resisting ! Oh, that's an error,
darling. Non-resistance is my strong
point."
“Iola”: The people of the Cliirima valley,
Papua, have a curious custom in regard to the dis-
posal of their dead. A small platform having been
erected outside the house of deceased, the corpse is
placed thereon and allowed to remain until the
bones of the skeleton are bleached by the sun, when
they are buried and the skull placed inside the
house to ornament the walls. In some tribes the
skull is afterwards brought forth during a dancing-
festival, bespattered with .the blood of a pig, and
then either buried in a garden to stimulate the crops
or cast away in the bush.

BILL : “I see be the paper ’ ere that .since booze has been abolished in Russia there ’as been

DOSSER : “ Wot d’ yer ex pec'? A bloke might as -well get shot if he can't get beer.”
“Masetto”: Can any Abo.-ite give this a
name? A camping-out party at Sorrento (Vic.)
the other day found a fish on the beach weighing
about Ccwt. and wearing a leather-like skin without
scales. It was seven feet long, and, including fins,
nearly as broad. The far end was fan-shaped. The
head resembled that of a bull, with powerful jaws,
but included no teeth. The mouth was only eight
inches wide. The eyes were full and ball-shaped,
and the ears large and flabby'. Unfortunately the
fish was not fresh at the time of discovery, or the
Museum might have scored a novelty.
“Spraggs”: “Cambridge” (B. 25/3/15),
speaking of the’ bot-fly, rsays: “Any drench strong
enough to make the grub let go his hold would be
strong enough to kill the horse.” That is open to
argument. Some years ago a farmer
near Warragul (Vic.) lost two valu-
able draught horses. He called me
in to explain things. The post-mortem
showed the horses to be in good condi-
tion, but t-here was a bunch of bots
adhering to the stomach. They re-
sembled a bunch of grapes, and com-
pletely blocked the breathing pas-
sage. I tried different experiments on
that nest of grubs; finally, I offered
them a bottle of strong pickle, pro-
cured from the local butcher. The
result was that every insect let go
his hold, and handed in the ghost.
The same day I encountered another
horse in trouble. The owner told
me that his vet. had summed the
case up as bot-fly, and had left in-
structions to have the animal de-
stroyed. I induced him to try the
pickle cure. Result, horse on his
feet next morning, and doing his
usual work within a week. The hot
is a curse in Gippsland, especially in the early
spring; and if somebody digs up a cure he will save
a lot of fine animals, and receive from their owners
a gold-lined hallelujah chorus.
“T.F.M. ’ : About the No-Good-Damper
Inn, referred to by “The Oldest Inhabitant” (B.
22/4/’l5) as having once ministered to thirsty souls
on the road ’twixt Melbourne and Dandenong. The
queer sign originated thus. In days when, to quote
George Reid, the “axe of the pioneer was cleaving
the way for the flowers of the mind,” a fair per-
centage of the axe-wielders held the notion that
Binghi ought to be wiped out as rapidly as possible,
and it is tolerably certain that deeds were done near
Port Phillip quite as atrocious as the Myall Creek
massacre. A squatting parson was tried in Mel-
bourne for wilful murder as a result of the methods
he adopted to “put the fear of God” in the hearts
of his black brethren ; and there was another ruffian
"’ho boasted that he shot every black, male and
female, large and small, that ventured within range
of his gun. He himself was stabbed to death by a
half-witted white man—the lethal weapon being a
shear-blade. \\ hen the gun as a civilising agency
began to be looked upon with suspicion by the Law, a
Scot hit upon the expedient of supplying Binghi with
damper flavored with arsenic.. The ‘prescription
became rather popular with the grand old pioneers
as being a safe and expeditious method of “cleaving
the way for the flowers of the mind”; and there is a
tradition in the Dandenong district that nearly a
whole tribe lost the number of its mess after sitting
down to a banquet of that sort in proximity to the
spot occupied by the No-Good ; Damper Inn.
“Outcast” : The Papuans, like most South
Sea Islanders, catch fish by using a vegetable poison
or narcotic, commonly the juice of the shrub Denis
Scandens or of the Pongamia. There has been much
discussion as to whether this is really an active
poison. I have positive proof that it is. A brown
lady of my acquaintance passed herself out into (I
hope) a better world the other day by thoroughly
chewing several pieces of the shrub. She had been
crossed in love, I understand. I recollect another
case of the same sort, but the lady recovered after I
had poured several pints of emetic into her. There
have been several instances known of ingenious
Papuans endeavoring to get rid of their bosses by
squeezing some of the decoction into their grub. The
thing, somehow, didn’t work ; but the gentle Papuans
received on the average about five years’ apiece for
their good intentions.
“Eddyson” : A pleasant, morning was spent
by the open-sea bathers at Ellwood (Melh.) on a re-
cent warm Sunday. There was the usual splashing
crowd of tritons and nymphs when the disturbing
element came scurrying along the damp edge of
sand, eagerly scanning the bathers. He carried a
large walking-stick in his hand, and he was angry.
He was in a hurry too. ITe was a tall, limber man
of ginger complexion, with white eyelashes, and red
eyes, and a splenetic expression. When a party was
too far out for ordinary inspection he applied a pair
of opera-glasses to his weak eyes; then, satisfied that
his prey was not there, he hurried on. Presently
he came opposite where a lusty dame of Juno-like
proportions and some 38 springs was laving her
length, and his glasses went up. A yell of triumph
followed. “Ah, there you are!” he snorted. “There
you are, madam. Come out!” Madam gave no
indication of having heard. “Come out, Mary!” he
howled. Mary turned her spacious back-view, and
dived. Sandyman—we found out who it was "after-
wards —addressed himself to her twinkling calves.
“Come out!” he squealed. Mrs. Sandyman resumed
the perpendicular, and playfully sprayed a com-
panion. “Come out!” cried Sandyman, dancing
angrily on the heach, and brandishing his stick.
“Come out, will you, or I'll give you mixed bathing!
Come out!” Mary splashed gaily, and spouted like
a whale. “If you don’t come out, Mary, I’ll come
in!” Mary betrayed every disposition to let him.
“Very well, Mrs. Sandyman.” The long, limber
husband started to wade, brandishing his stick, and
keeping his opera-glasses on Mary; and from far and
near along the shore the bathers gathered in to
enjoy another open-air show. Sandyman waded up
to his waist yelling commands to Mary as he
went, and Mary drifted into deeper water.
Sandyman followed, and Mary went her limit. “I’ll
teach you—l’ll give you mixed bathing,” roared
Sandyman. “I’ll let this low herd see what’s proper
treatment for a wife who desecrates the Sabbath, and
makes a. vulgar exhibition of her fat in public.”
Sandyman reached his Mary. He clawed for her
with one hand, and hit at her with the other. Mary
awoke to the urgency of the ease. She ported her
helm hard over, and deliberately rammed Sandyman.
Sandyman went over and under. The inrush of
water interrupted a blasphemous cry. Sandyman
arose, spouted a sluice-head, and went to the attack
again. This time his stick connected, and Mary
went under. She must have taken Sandy with a
submarine attack, for lie sank suddenly and with a
wild cry. There was a tumult of the deep, sugges-
tive of a. conflict of whales, and half of Mary came
up. It was the wrong half. The conflict continued.
Mary’s prow arose, and she reasserted herself. Sandy’s
long legs were madly thrashing the element, but the
rest of him was still submerged, and public sus-
picion tended to the idea that Mary was treading on
his neck. Only when Mrs. Sandyman had been
forcibly removed by three men was Sandyman per-
mitted to rise to the surface. Then he floated bottom
up, and was towed ashore ; and only when the rules
for the resuscitation of the waterlogged had been
vigorously applied for 10 minutes was he in a fit
slate to sit up and take nourishment. ITe went home
limply in a milk-cart at his own expense. Madam
continued her bath in the full possession of her
senses.
The sea serpent has turned lip again and
brought his family along. A settler at Kawhia
(M.L.) saw them from his homestead; in fact, he
watched that proceshun shea-sherpents till shun
shunk. He reports that the largest was 700 ft. long
and as big round as the national debt. Kawhia is
in a prohibition district.

NIGHTMARE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I rode it bareback through the dark
Down precipices steep,
Where Terror springs from the abyss,
And Horrors writhe and creep ;
And while, with black fear in my heart,
1 heard the golpliin roar,
I started at the ghastly sight
Of blood upon the floor!
But from the vengeful publican,
Who came my limbs to chain
With empty pots, I leapt the gap—
And I was free again!
Then, sliding down the hanging rope,
I came upon its end,
And, miles below, with gaping jaws,
Espied my perjured friend.
The serpent twisted round my neck;
But as the waters sprang
To hurl me from the broken mast
The clarion order rang:
“Charge on!” I felt my pockets through,
But could not find a cent,
Although the fearful day had come
When I must meet the rent.
Still as the earthquake shook the house,
And as the chimney fell,
Due chance of safety still remained—
The yawning mouth of Hell !
But while I crouched within the cave,
With heart near turned to, lead,
I heard a voice from out the depths
i Shriek: “Grill, one!” and 1 fled.
Vet, when I reached the floor I sought,
The lift would not delay;
My friends wept treacle on the stairs,
But upwards on its way
The cursed thing still shot, until
The sun with brightness shone,
\ ■ And I was hiding in a bush,
! And all my clothes had gone.
I tried to dodge the full-dressed crowds
That watched the stirring race;
But, as they cheered the horses on,
'They neared my hiding place,
Until, to get beyond their gaze,
I ran with all my might.
Trams, horses, lamp-posts—all pursued
And kept me well in sight.
: ’Twas thus we crossed the mountain ledge
With briar-thorns o’ergrown,
Where meditative elephants
Had marked me for their own !
Oner chance alone with me remained,
Which instantly I took :
I promptly shut my harrowed eyes
And read the Doomsday Book.
The world slipped underneath my feet,
And slithered out of place;
As. hurtled every way at once,
I tumbled into space....
And then the Dago waiter spoke—-
His words dropped dull and slow:
“You’ve eaten all your mayonnaise;
Now pay the bill and go!”

“Rill Bowyang”: Like “Cordcx” (R.
8/4/’l5) I used to ridicule buslmien's yarns about
the swimming abilities of the wallaby, but what I
saw on the banks of the Don (N.Q.) sonic 3’ears back
convinced me that, when pushed, he can hold his
own in the water with any other animal. The giver
was flooded, and I was watching the huge logs racing
down-stream when I saw a full-grown wallaby hop to
the edge. The appearance of several dogs in the
rear forced him to act quickly. Springing in, he
was immediately swept down-stream, but gradually
worked across, and, after 20 minutes’ battling,
reached the opposite bank.

The Best History of the War
A Permanent Record of Undying Interest.
STARTLING DIPLOMATIC DISCLOSURES.
Amid the flood of announcements of "his-
tories of the War,” it is good news to hear
that such a widely renowned firm as the
Standard Publishing Company Pty., Ltd., of
Melbourne, Sydney and Adelaide, has now
published the first volume of “The History
of the Great European War,” by W. Stanley
Macbean Knight, not issued in paper-covered
weekly or fortnightly parts, but in hand-
somely bound volumes. Even a casual glance
at the first volume makes it obvious that this
is the only work yet announced to show any
true appreciation of the needs of a real
history of the present War.
For one thing, this history of the War is
unique in that it sets, out in clear and
masterly fashion the moves and counter-
moves of the great diplomatic War, the
failure of which led inevitably to the appeal
to the sword. To appreciate this, and to
understand fully the cause of the War, it is
essential to trace the growth and develop-
ments of German policy for oO years or
more, and to study its hidden workings all
the world over.
STARTLING DIPLOMATIC SECRETS.
In the first volume of the “History of the
Great European War.” this is done in a
story of the most intense interest, and this
volume will undoubtedly create a profound
sensation. These revelations shatter many
preconceived ideas about our European
neighbors, disclosing as they do many
hitherto unpublished facts that throw a
startling light on the swollen ambitions and
treacherous deeds of the Prussian military
caste. The pages, indeed, afford a most
extraordinary revelation of the diplomatic
underworld.
The name of the author is sufficient guar-
antee of the authoritative nature of the work,
but it is interesting to know that the
peculiar resources of the publishers have
enabled exceptional arrangements to be made
for (be producing of an absolutely authentic
account of the actual progress of the War.
For the author has the assistance of many
high naval and military authorities.
THE STORY r OF THE FIGHTING.
For this reason “The History of the Great
European War” will be unique in providing
a full, true and connected story of the whole
field of operations. This part of the work
will be written in its true perspective, as the
actual facts and details of the operations
are only now being disclosed, and the
strategy of the Allies from the beginning of
the War is now being understood: Natur-
ally. special attention is being paid to the
actions of our own men. Tn these pages
we will learn at last the details of that mid-
night mobilisation, when our troops sailed for
their secret destination with no cheering
crowd to see them off. but with a smib' on
their lips, and courage in their hearts. With
them we shall land on foreign soil, with them
we shall march to their places in the firing
line, and step by step we shall follow them
from their baptism of fire on that Sunday
in August, when they repulsed six desperate
charges in succession, to the day when they
return home after the final restoration of
Peace. Pages such as these are full of
stories of heroism, of deeds unequalled in the
literature of the world, moving tales that will
thrill the reader when the War is over, and
stir his children and his children’s children
to a realisation of all that the word of P>riton
and British courage mean.
A PERMANENT RECORD.
In “The History of the Great European
War” the reader is able to make sure of get-
ting for the first time a permanent and
authentic record of this great Armageddon.
In this first volume, in its handsome binding,
worthy of a place in any library, he has a
work containing a vast amount of material
to which he must refer if he wishes fully to
appreciate the course of events. The work
is illustrated with a vast profusion of exclu-
sive photographs taken in the sphere of
operations, with many colored plates, and
with a unique series of maps in color, also a
special series of maps showing the progress
and developments of the great battles, forts,
lines of fighting, disposition of forces, etc.

MY MAIDEN SPEECH
ANP HOW I MADE IT.
By JOHN HERRICK.
I may explain, tu start with, that I am an
ordinary business man—and perhaps you
might think that, as such, I don’t really need
to be able to make a speech. But in my
business, at any rate, we are. always bold-
ing meetings and dinners to discuss business
subjects of various sorts. Till recently
when I have attended such meetings I have
gone as a spectator, and never dared to get
on my legs and make a speech. This was
not through lack of a desire to do so, for I
noticed long ago that the men who spoke
oftenest and best were the men who got on
best in their business —and, like most other
men, 1 want to get on in business, too.
THE TERRORS OF “NERVES.”
It was simply lack of ability. I had never
made a speech, and was too nervous to try.
But that is all altered now. I made my
maiden speech two months ago, and since
then I lia_ve made three more. My first was
rather halting, though I did not disgrace
myself, but my fourth, only last Friday, was
a real success. I had lost my nervousness ;
I made my points, and I carried the meeting
with me till I sat down amid real applause.
And the pleasure that applause gave me!
It was like the old days when one won a
prize at school, and one felt that the world
was a good world after all.
Moreover, it is not only a great pleasure
to be able to make a good speech; it is
nowadays really a business necessity.
To one man the chance of. making a speech
affords the opportunity for an enhanced re-
putation; to another it is nothing but a
danger. For the man who stutters and
stammers, and finally sits down after a
speech principally consisting of “urns”
and “ers,” scarcely enhances his reputation
as a keen-witted member of the community,
or as a man whose intelligence and resource
can be depended upon in a business crisis.
THE SECRET OF SUCCESS.
And because of that I am going to make
a confession. I owe every bit of that
success to —what do you think? —a book, a
book which first of all put me in the right
way of thinking out a speech, which then
provided me an amusing story with which
to start, and which finally gave me many
valuable hints on the actual making of the
speech. You may think this a lot for a book
to do. So it is, but this book does it all.
And the name of this book is the Book of
Public Speaking. It is the only work of its
kind ever published in this country, and it
is a book that ought to be in the hands of
every man, whatever his position in life, who
is liable to be called upon to make a speech
in public. It is written by men who are
famous for the brilliance of their own
speeches, and their articles cover every phase
of the subject, from the choice of a topic and
the selection of material to the art of gesture
and the silencing of interrupters. For in-
stance, there are:—
Rt. Hon. J. T. MACXAMARA, M.P.,
on “Plow to Make an Effective Speech”;
Sir \Y. ROBERTSON NICOLE
(Editor of the British Weekly),
on “The Art of Oratory”;
ARTHUR BOURCHIER, M.A.
(the well-known actor),
on “Plow to Prepare and deliver a Speech” ;
J. L. GRIFFITHS
(U.S.A. Consul-General, London),
on “After-Dinner Speaking” ;
A. C. BENSON, M.A.,
on “The Art of Lecturing.”
Who could be better qualified than these
men to teach one how to speak? And in
case one has an opportunity to be chairman
or steward at a public meeting, there is also
a valuable series of articles by Albert Crew,
barrister-at-law. explaining every point of
the legal aspect of public speaking, and
dealing with the whole subject of the conduct
of and procedure at meetings.
MATERIAL FOR ALL SPEECHES.
But this'is only a portion of the work,
for the “Book of Public Speaking” also con-
tains models, materials and suggestions for
speeches on all subjects under the sun.
But the “Book of Public Speaking’’ is of
the greatest interest even for the man who
never lias to speak in public, because it pre-
sents for the first time an entirely new form
of literature of enthralling interest. Its
handsome covers contain the cream of the
greatest speeches of modern times.
There is hardly an orator of note of re-
cent years who is not represented in the
work ; there is scarcely a subject of import-
ance or of interest that is not dealt with in
one or more of the speeches, Political ora-
tions, religious addresses, after-dinner
speeches, scientific and literary lectures—all
have been brought together to form a work
of enthralling interest to all intelligent
people. Among the great speakers whose
speeches are included in the work arc: —
THE WORLD’S GREATEST ORATORS.
John Bright.
Chauncey Depew.
Sir A. Conan Doyle.
Sir Edward Grey.
Earl Halsbury.
Sir Henry Irving.
Lord Fisher.
Abraham Lincoln.
Justin McCarthy.
Viscount Milner.
M. Poincare.
White law Reid.
Theodore Roosevelt.
Philip Snowden.
Tan Maclaren.
Emile Zola.
Augustine Birroll.
Sir A. \V. Pinero.
Lord Rosebery.
Lord Beaconsfield.
It. 11. Asquith.
A. ,T. Balfour.
G. F. G. Mastennan.
W. E. Gladstone.
Sir Edward Clarke.
Andrew Lang.
1 >. Lloyd George.
Winston Churchill.
Mark Twain.
S. Leigh Hughes.
Joseph Chamberlain.
Max O'Rell.
R. AValdo Emerson.
Harold Cox.
Woodrow Wilson.
G. Bernard Shaw.
Charles Dickens.
Etc., etc.
FOR THE PUBLIC SPEAKER.
The value of these speeches to the public
speaker can hardly be over-estimated. Each
one of Ihc speeches included in the work
serves as a model for the construction of a
successful speech, that can be studied with
advantage by the practised speaker and the
novice alike. Each speech, also serves as a
fund of valuable ideas to be used in the
actual preparation of a speech.
INDISPENSABLE TO ALL,
Altogether, there is no doubt that politi-
cians, debaters, clergymen and all others
whose position in life calls for the power of
being able to speak in public, will find “The
Book of Public Speaking” an absolutely in-
dispensable work. However unusual the sub-
ject upon which they lack material, they will
find it here. Anecdotes, parallels, analogies,
ideas and suggestions—all are to be found
in profusion in its pages. Alike for the prac-
tised speaker and for the man who wishes
to acquire this valuable art, no work so im-
portant has ever been published.
THREE OPINIONS.
PHILIP SNOWDEN, Esq., M.P., writes:
“The selection of speeches seems to me to be admir-
able. The introduction and the articles on the ‘Art
of Public Speaking’ are full of very excellent advice.”
Sir W. BULL, M.P., writes:
“What a godsend ‘The- Book of Public Speaking’
will be to a busy man who is called upon at short
notice to make 200 speeches a year on all sorts of
subjects. It will be useful to young men who are
really in earnest in wanting to speak well, whilst no
public man’s library should be without it.”
MORGAN THOMAS, Esq., Lord Mayor
of Cardiff, writes:
“ ‘The Book of Public Speaking’ will be of very
valuable assistance to those who are desirous of
qualifying as public speakers.' It cannot but be
valuable to the future public men of this country.”

A SPECIAL OFFER.
CHARLES DICKENS PLEASES ALL.
There is one author whose works
should be found in every home;
one author who will improve upon
larger acquaintance, one author who
blends together all our many and
various emotions, passions and ac-
tivities, and, by handling these
humanly and sympathetically, passes
on to us his own broad, tolerative views
of life. This author is Charles Dickens,
the one author whose complete works
should be found in every home, and
whose works will enliven and please
many dull hours or odd moments.
These are recognised facts, and are
admitted by all. Yet in bow many
houses is a complete edition to be
found ?
A\ c have no hesitation in affirming
that in our Standard Edition of the
Works of Dickens, in thirty volumes,
that we arc issuing the most attractive
and delightful edition of the works of
this great novelist. There are many,
many other editions upon the market,
and there is not one of them which can
compare with this Standard Edition,
which is now offered at a popular price.
The Standard Edition includes a
splendid Life of Dickens, bv the late
F. Cf. Kitten. This was written speci-
ally for the Standard Edition by an
author who has made Dickens the study
of a lifetime. As this Life occupies
two volumes, it will be seen that it is
no mere sketch, but a complete and fas-
cinating story.
The illustrations in this edition are
one of its many excellent features.
All the famous orbrinal illustrations of
Cruickshank. "Phiz,” Leech, etc., are
here reproduced. Their work was
examined and passed by the great
novelist himself. No edition is com-
plete unless it actually contains all
these original illustrations. Another
great feature of the Standard Edition
is that it contains over 100 full-page
illustrations in full color.
To each novel is prefixed an enter-
taining short illustrated introduction,
giving the date and circumstances
when the novel was written, and inter-
esting particulars about the actual
places in which the scene was laid. The
interest in these introductions will be
further increased by illustrations of
famous places in the land of Dickens.
The tvpe in which these volumes are
printed is singularly clear and easy to
read. There are 336 illustrations alto-
gether in these fine thirty volumes, and
the total number of pages is 8837.
TWO OPINIONS.
Mr. John A. Christopherson, French
Island: —“Every lover of Dickens must re-
joice to have possession of a copy of the
‘London Dickens,’ recently issued by you
to the public of Australia. When I first
ordered a copy from you, observing the low
price at which it was sold, and the ex-
tremely easy conditions of sale, I was not
prepared to find the whole thirty volumes
well bound in cloth ; each volume printed in
large, clear type ; and, above all, illustrated
in a superior manner. lam very much
pleased with the work, and consider it an
important addition to my library/’
Mr. A. C. Browne. State School. Ivyneton :
“I cannot speak too highly of the ‘London
Dickens.’ The binding is good, the printing
is clear and easily read, and the illustrations
are everything that can be desired. In
short, it is an excellent edition.”
A FREE BOOKLET.
In order to encourage and help every home to
possess its own edition of Dickens, we have
decided to offer this set upon remarkably easy
terms, particulars of which will be forwarded
post free to all who use this form. They will
receive a handsomely-illustrated prospectus of
The Standard Dickens, which will tell them all
about this fine edition, the division of the
volumes, etc., and give specimens of the illus-
trations.
Full details will also be found of their speci-
ally good offer to deliver this edition, carriage
paid, for a first payment of 4/-, the balance
being paid by small monthly payments.
To the Standard Publishing Co. P't’.v Ltd.. 100
Flinders Street, Melbourne; 10 Hunter
Sydney.
Please send me, free of charge, and without
anv obligation on my part, full information about
“The Standard Dickens,” with particulars of your
plan of easy monthly payments to booklovcrs.

SOME DISTINGUISHED PEOPLE RELATE THEIR EXPERIENCE.
“ I HAVE given Sanatogen a fair

the medical opinion there is no
longer that feeling of fatigue which
one previously experienced, hut
there follows from its use a distinct-
restorative effect.”

and always with good results.”

a tonic nerve food, Sanat-

“ I FIND Sanatogen an excellent
1 tonic.”
Ql
“ T HAVE been taking Sanatogen,
A and think that it has decidedly
helped me to get through the ex-
tremely arduous work that I have
had to do during the past few
months.”
SANATOGEN has done every-
thing for me which it is said
to be able to do for cases of nervous
weakness and exhaustion. I began
to take it after nearly four years’
enforced idleness from extreme
ill-health, and now (after only four
months) I find myself able to enjoy
both work and play again.
“ OIR FREDERICK MILNER was
k-/ much run down from over-
work when he took Sanatogen, and
it certainly did good. He has more
than once sent supplies to poor
people, run down from illness or
overwork, and it has invariably
proved successful. It seems both to
nourish and give strength.”
HAVE for two months been
A suffering from a rather severe
attack of Congestion of the Lungs.
I am now recovering and rapidly

in a great measure to my having
taken Sanatogen twice daily for
some weeks.”

Sanatogen can be obtained of all Chemists

“S’gazer”: Can anyone tell me why
Repertory audiences are so prodigal in the
use of moth-balls? Is there any known
reason why this particular audience should
dissipate in moth-balls beyond the dreams
of avarice? Does the moth seek to corrupt
Repertory audiences more than any other
assemblage of adults, and is this merely an
effort of self-preservation? The fact that
Repertory audiences exhale a rich and pene-
trating odor of moth-balls will not be denied
by any intelligent person who has sniffed at
Repertory plays. The one solution of the
mystery that presents itself to my mind is
supported by several other peculiarities of
the Repertory audience; for instance, its
quaint array of seams and folds, suggesting
that it is capable of being wrapped up and
put away for future use. In brief, my
belief is that there is only one Repertory
audience, and after each performance it is
carefullv. packed up and put away in boxes
by the thoughtful management.
“Yarra Ben”: The Repertory folks may
swank a lot and think they’re up-to-date
when they give us Brieux, Strindberg.
Hauptmann and the minor dotty dramatists.
But if they only knew how nineteen-hun-
dred-and-fast-asleep they really are! What
about Evreinoff, the Russian playwright?
Those highbrows who are gluttons for
psychology and the other classy ologies on
the stage may justly protest that they are'
losing a treat while Evreinoff’s “Theatre of
the Soul” is neglected. It was recently
administered to a London audience by a
society known as “Pioneer Players” at the
Little Theatre, which is appropriately situ-
ated near Charing Cross Hospital. In a
sort of prologue “a professor appears before
the curtain, and with the aid of symbols and
diagrams chalked upon a blackboard, ex-
plains how the Soul proper, M, is made up
of three separate and generally warring
sections. Ml, AI2 and AD respectively, its
Rational, Emotional and Subliminal, or
Psychical, entities. AVe are shown on the
stage itself something like a small dissect-
ing table, on which is fixed the Soul, with
blood pulsing through and with nerves pain-
fully strained, pulled and twanged, almost
as in a torture chamber, by the Emotional
entity, finally successful in causing the
man to blow his brains out.” The pro-
gramme gave the information that “the
action takes place in the Soul in the space
of half a second,” which that reprehensible
person, the ordinary playgoer, might think
too long. Now who will be the first to put
this pretty little piece up in Australia?
AA’herever and whenever it is staged I pro-
mise not to be there.
“Extra Turn” : Of all the variety artists
in England at present—not excepting Alarie
Lloyd—Airs. Pankhurst is still the most
remarkable. The old battler put in a week
as a star recently at the London Pav.,
Piccadilly Circus. She was engaged to give
a short address each evening upon the Ger-
man menace and women’s work in the war.
But she wasn't her old se }f, to
she had six chances and didn t
get herself arrested once. .
“0.K.”: George Bryant is said to . b ® a a

lias only his voice to blame. He has culti
rated that sonorous, explosive cigan
deep pitch of disrespectability. «is ■
are bloodthirsty, and his sneer ™
guilt. No man was ever quite so alarming
as George Bryant sounds. His bittei
laughter threatens sudden death, to matte
him seem comparatively harmless -
management needs to put him baqk ? to L b
cal times when even the best of em we
rugged citizens. For instance, Bryant
made an impressive brother Ken ben m
".Joseph and his Brethren.” Then lus good
looks got a chance, and his tremendous
voice seemed not inconsistent with a good
l ieart — as the times went. One didn t ex-
pect an early son of Jacob to be a veiy
gentle shepherd.
Arthur Shirley, part author of “Tommy
Atkins,” now burning powder at Sydney
Adelphi, and last seen here in ‘Air. Wn
and Spencer’s “Shepherd of the Southern
Cross” film, has gone to America, He has
signed a contract with the big Kalem pic-
ture company, and will henceforward be a
sort of semi-leading man in mushy Yankee
dramas. Says the Los Angeles Photoplay
News Service: “Mr. Shirley will appear in
a large production that has been in con-
templation for some time, but has been
hung up waiting for a competent man to
handle the principal role. This part has
been assigned to Shirley. The American
public can look forward to some high-class
work from this noted Australian player.”
Maskelyne and Devant’s old-standing
magic show in London has found what
seems a new way of dishing up the disap-
pearing trick. A man gets into a wooden
box, which is then put into anpther made
of glass, and the whole concern is swung
up into the air and suspended. The usual
inspection committee is called up from the
audience. It includes a bearded man, who
presently brandishes a pistol, and finally
insists on firing it at the glass case to “see
if there is any fake.” AA T hen the assistants
collar him his beard comes off. It is the
man who was fastened down in the box.
Gregan McAlahon (otherwise the Alelb.
Repertory Theatre) writes: “To set at
rest the sensitive soul of ‘H.O.’ (B.
29/4/T5) and to ease it of its dismal ap-
prehensions regarding the Alelb. Repertory
Theatre, let it be proclaimed that it is quite
possible for a Repertory theatre play-agency
to be ‘under the patronage of J. O. Wil-
liamson Ltd.’ and yet remain what it claims
to be. It might surely be clear enough, that
what the agency is prepared to do is to
express an ooinion upon plays written for
the commercial stage as well as those
written for the repertory stage. Discrimi-
nation between these two classes of plays
L surely not inconsistent with the aims of
the Repertory Theatre.”
Business, Bobbery, etc.
“Bush Rat”: What appears to be just
now the city “shrewdie’s” favorite method
of extracting quidlets from the cheque-
proud station hand is as follows. After
finding his lamb and mentioning the names
of a few Outback towns, the sharp claims
acquaintanceship, and invites him to come
and have a drink. He is led to
slaughter in the bar parlor where the
rest of the clique lounge about. The
lamb’s acquaintance offers to shout for
the lot, whereat there is an argu-
ment as to who shall pay for the drinks.
They are such good fellows that they
all want to pay. Finally everybody agrees to
throw a bob in. A search for the dice always
proves a failure, so cards are resorted to,
the arrangement being that whoever gets
the three best poker hands first wins. One
of the clique deals. The lamb gets the best
hand first time. The others don’t show
their hands. The game is then altered so
that the stakes are doubled every deal for
everybody except the player, who holds the
winning hand. The lamb, holding the best
hand, agrees. He also wins the second
deal. Then his luck stops. By the time
everyone has won two deals, there is a big
pool on the table, which is finally won by
a member of the gang. I’ve been caught
myself, and every second mug I meet re-
turning from the city has the same tale to
tell without the slightest alteration.
It could be made Graball instead of
Rabaul.

A Melbourne man, employed for years in
the saddlery business, a while ago submitted
to the Defence authorities a device which
it was claimed would make the cavalryman’s
seat as soft as a bed of roses and save his
moke from getting a sore back. After six
months’ local test the idea proved so good
that it is being sent to the War Office in
London. By the look of things its adoption
is almost certain; and that will be another
little one planked in the ribs of the Hun by
Australia.
“Ruru”: An appeal was recently made
by hardwood sawmillers to architects to
specify as much hardwood as possible in
new buildings. It was explained that, owing
to the war, the saws were growing rusty,
and that it was good patriotism to use the
local stuff. This is all right; but what
about the prices they have been charging
for their timber? In a price-list hardwood
measuring 3 x 2 is quoted at 10s. per 100
feet lineal. In the same list Oregon of the
same size is quoted at ISs. per 100 feet
super. Which means that hardwood in one
of its most useful sizes is rather more thau
twice the price of the imported Oregon. If
the sawmillers really want to encourage a
patriotic use of the local timber, they might
contrive to put it on the market at a less
burglarious price.
N. S. Wales municipal and shire councils
have tripped over another loose screw. Per-
mission must be obtained from a council
before a building can be erected, and plans
must be submitted and approved. But
there is apparently no power to set a time-
limit for completion of any building. So a
man who has submitted a beautiful plan
and had it accepted can erect merely one
or two rooms, and explain that he intends
to finish the palace when he has the neces-
sary cash.
* * * *
“Oliver Oatmeal”: At the last Wellington
woolsale a buyer exploded with such force
that his bawl of 173 d. was registered as a
Alaoriland record for crossbred wool. The
necessity for military clobber accounted, of
course, for the price. Yet I know acres of
cockies who won’t give a man a job if he’s
a territorial and has to attend drill during
the year for a few hours out of the 8700.
He was a naturalised Gerliog, but every
year he sent his savings away for invest-
ment in the Fatherland until he had thou-
sands of pounds sunk in Berlin. He used
to smoke his pipe in peace and gloat over
the drafts remitting the interest on which
he lived. Then Bill broke loose, the mail
between the Fatherland and Alaoriland
dropped dead, and since last August the
anti-Sosh Ilun has not been hearing from the
capital that was driven from Masseyville.
Therefore his remarks about Shermany are
violent and bitter and disloyal, and his
opinion of the Kaiser unprintable. When
the mail left he was applying for the Old
Age Pension.
* * * *
Bushranging in Australia was first
adopted as a profession in dune, 1794, and
the start of the business was thus recorded :
In addition to several most daring burglaries a
highway robbery has been committed during the course
of the month. This was a species of depravity
hitherto unknown in this country; and might per-
haps be deemed one step towards refinement, as being
at least a more manly mode of taking property than
that which the pilfering, dark-loving knaves amongst
us adopted.
If only a proper view had been taken of the
refining influences of the craft, Victoria
might have appointed Ned 'Kellv a univer-
sity professor—perhaps even chairman of
the Ban f i c t Union —instead of making a
target of him.
THE ARTIST.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I saw him sitting by the creek,
A canvas spread before.
His halting- brush put in a streak,
A doleful look he bore.
The picture (what I saw of it)
Seemed like a kitten in a fit.
He asked me for a match, l sat,
Some sympathetic words
To pass along. He told me that
Tie- hated painting birds,
And cows, and things that moved. He said
lie couldn't keep them in his head.
“You know this ain’t my reg’lar toil;
But times is awful, and
I gotter make the billy boil
By paintin’ bits of land.
A feller's forced to when there ain’t
No blessed houses left to paint.”

Why deny yourself, because you are unable to operate
the keyboard of your “silent” piano, the inspiration, in-
fluence, enjoyment and entertainment of good music ?
Music is not now only for the fortunate few who by dint
of lifelong practice, are able more or less imperfectly, to
attain to the higher flights of musical skill and technique
necessary to the rendition of the most beautiful and
difficult compositions of the great masters.
It is not necessary now to depend upon the one (if
there be even one) musical member of the family for
musical entertainment.
(Made in Australia)
will enable you, with absolute ease, and without any previous musical
training, to at once enjoy any kind of music you may fancy.
Classical Music, Sacred Music, Dance Music, Ragtime, all are not

(Made in Australia)
is not just an ordinary “self-playing” piano. It is the first perfect Player-
Piano, built on a unique principle, demonstrably superior to any impor-
ed Player-Piano. Its operation is simplicity itself. The construction is
mainly in aluminium, there being no perishable rubber tubes or connec-
tions, and its sensitiveness, expressiveness, ease of operation, extreme
beauty of tone and durability, are unequalled.
Compare the BEALE PLAYER-PIANO (made in Australia) with any
imported Player-Piano , and you will be convinced of its superiority.

••D ” • I do wish someone in authority
would do something about the National
Anthem trouble. Most of us know the British
and French anthems. But few know that of
Russia, and not one in 50 has any idea ot
the first two bars of the Belgian or Servian
hvmns. And now Italy is said to be com-
ing in on our side, and it that happens
Greece will do the same, and so probably
will Bulgaria and Roumania, and possibly
Spain, Portugal and Albania. he are
faced by cTiaos. In & tea-room, the other
afternoon the band played the British hymn.
We all pushed back our cups, brushed oft
the crumbs and stood. Then came the Mar-
seillaise. We stood some more. Hollowed
an air which was diagnosed by a few as the
Russian anthem. By this time ooU
teas were getting cold and a similar
number of tempers were growing hot. How-
ever, loyalty was calling and we continued
to stand. Something out of “The Merry
Widow” followed, and with a sigh of relief
all present subsided and fell upon their
neglected victuals. They had hardly done
so when a stately passage accompanied by
a fanfare of trumpets and a ruffle of drums
proclaimed that something further in the
martial hymn line was afoot. “The Servian
anthem!” hissed an officious female, her eye
ablaze with enthusiasm. And up we
all had to get again. We found
later, as a matter of fact, that this number
was not the Servian anthem, but Op. 790 by
Ilildebrandt von Spizzel. However, the
principle was the same. It seems to me
that if any more European countries decide
to lay into Germany the only thing for us
to do will be to attend our theatres and
restaurants on the counter-lunch principle.
There are entertainments already where
chairs are no more than so many mockeries.
Formerly those little housewife’s aids
known as flour sifters were turned out by a
U.S.A. factory which was alleged to have a
monopoly of the world’s markets. The Aus-
tralian importer, at any rate, was wont to
explain to inquirers that it was hopeless for
any local manufacturer to compete —even if
he could get the market he would have to lay
down expensive plant which would meet a
year’s Australian supply in a week. It
sounded all right; bnt with American sup-
plies cut off through the scarcity of shipping,
a Melbourne manufacturer rushed into the
opening and is supplying a thoroughly good
article at the same wholesale price. The
trouble is that when the war is over and
the business of carting goods across the
earth becomes normal once more, the U.S.A.
will notice this Australian outbreak and will
dump surplus sifters here at a price the
other can’t look at. Still Fisher and Frank
Tudor can save the enterprising Australian
if they will. All depends on the Protection
they give him.
Mrs. Isaacs is the first Judge’s wife in
these parts to drive her own motor-car. The
enterprise has also been successfully under-
taken by daughter Nancy and another mem-
ber of the brainy household, the ladies’
maid.
The death of E. F. Du Faur in Sydney
revives recollection of his attempt, in 1874.
to find a white man then alleged to be living
with the natives in Western Queensland
and to have been seen there by Andrew
llume. This Hume was a Scot, born in
1835, who came to the colony when an
infant. lie had taken to the bush and
travelled the Far West from north to south,
but had fallen foul of the law. It was then
he told of finding the white man, whose
story, Hume alleged, was that he was the
one survivor of the Leichhardt expedition.
Du Faur, chiefly at his own expense, fitted
out Hume and two companions, O’Hea. and
Thompson, to go and fetch the survivor in.
The affair proved a fiasco. The trio started
from Dynevor Downs and left the Wilson
for Cooper’s Creek in the latter part of
November, 1874. Failing to discover water
o.u the fourth day, Hume and O’Hea. broke
down. Thompson after much hardship got
back to a station. A relief party sent out
from there found Hume dead, and later on
O’llea’s body was stumbled over not far
fl Wfl V.
“E.J.C.”: The Commonwealth Govern-
ment, which in these days waves a lordly
hand and says “Do the thing properly,” will
have to keep a sharp look-out or it will
develop an extravagance just as iniquitous
as that of N. S. Wales. I quote, the ■■matter
of the condensers at Thursday Maind as a
case in point. These ugefl—
or, rather, were intended -to 'ihq- used in
converting salt-water into drinking-water,
primarily for the use of the garrison. The
work of erection was not started until, quite
recently, the Island’s local Hoard began vto
get a move'on with its own reservoir. Ehe
Commonwealth Government’s condenser
apparatus was then quickly finished by a
gang of about 50 men, at a cost running
into several thousands. It was obviously
rushed through in this way because, it the
reservoir was completed first, there could
lie no excuse for building condensers and
thus “giving employment.” Now the reser-
voir has been finished and found so satis-
factory that the Federal authorities have
decided to dismantle the condensers and
return them to Melbourne. Of course the
facts that the equipment has never been
used, and that thousands of bags of cement
have been wasted, are mere details only;
also the wages paid for building and dis-
mantling were mere details. But they would
lose any private individual his job.


A GOOD REMEDY FOR
SALLOW COMPLEXIONS.
Everyone may have a clear and bright
complexion, free from furrows or wrinkles, if
they will only take a "little daily trouble in
the following manner : Buy some Puritol wax
from the chemist or draper, and apply every
night, lap a little cold water on the face ten
times with the hands every morning, allow-
ing it to get thoroughly round the closed
eyes, and pinch the skin very gently across
all wrinkles. Puritol Wax Soap, which
leaves a fine film of wax on the skin, should
be used; this acts as a protective during the
day. This treatment arouses the dormant
Derves and blood vessels, and undoubtedly
accounts for many of the clear complexions
so much admired by those who do not yet
know the secret.* [3

REPORTS WONDERFUL HAIR
GROWTH.
REMARKABLE RESULTS FOLLOW
USE OF SIMPLE FORMULA.
During the last few years a simple hair-
growing formula has appeared on several
occasions in leading publications, and has
aroused a great deal of interest, not only
on account of its simplicity and inexpensive-
ness, but also because of the remarkable
results so uniformly reported from its use.
Increased growths of from one to three inches
a month, disappearance of dandruff in one
to three days, and the stopping of falling
hair in the same time, making harsh, dry,
brittle hair soft, luxuriant and glossy, etc.,
are of such frequent occurrence that it is
not surprising to learn that this popular and
well-known formula, which calls for 2oz.
bay rum, -Rlram menthol crystals, and loz.
Lavona de Composee, is now being put up
complete ready for use under the name of
Lavona Hair Tonic, and on account of its
proven merit is now being sold by leading
chemists everywhere, each of whom is
authorised by the manufacturers to give with
every bottle their signed personal guarantee
of satisfaction or money back —convincing
evidence that Lavona Hair Tonic will give
the highest degree of satisfaction to every
user.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
“ FOR VALOR."
NEUTRAL CORRESTONDENT: "You dropped a
bomb on the hospital , eh? Wal, I guess
that's nothin' to write home about."
THE HERO: “ Ah! But id vas der children's
’ ospital.”
“The war will begin in May”—and it did,
for Australia.
Politics are a queer game. The last
political speech Tommy Walker made in
N. S. Wales before he came east the other
day to the Premiers’ Conference was as
the opponent of W. J. Ferguson, one of the
bright young men of the Labor party.
Tommy scored about one vote to Ferguson’s
20. Then Tommy was given a lift West,
where he suffered a sort of reincarnation,
joined the Labor party, read law and be-
came Attorney-General; while Ferguson
dropped the Labor party, and as a Liberal
hack was set at impossible hurdles till he
got tired and faded right away. Incident-
ally, the Joe Cook who was Labor leader
when Tommy was an anti-Laborite has
become Liberal leader; and Meagher, who
was an anti-Laborite, has been the effulgent
president of the Political Labor League.
Besides finding out that the Defence
Department habitually imports officers, and
thus keeps young Australians in the small
jobs, R. M. Anderson, the Federal Govern-
ment’s Commissioner, discovered that many
articles required by the Department are
imported when they might be locally pro-
duced. Thus, for building the coffer dam
at Cockatoo Island shipyards, foreign pine
was purchased, though any quantity of
Australian hardwood was available. Are
all the Governments in Australia mad? Or
do these things happen just like the
weather ?
A word or two in season arrives from the
Northern Territory after a journey of eight
weeks: —•
There are two plain questions these advocates of
colored labor should be made to answer at the
beginning of their arguments. One is what particular
industry do they want colored labor for; the other,
what agricultural product will stand several hundred
miles of road haulage? When these points have been
made clear, the rest is easier to follow. It is
not coolies we want, but bores and transport. Here
on the Victoria River the country for many miles
consists of beautiful rich alluvial flats, black soil
and red loam. A plough could be used on much of
it to-day. The rainfall averages over 18in. Vege-
tables do well, and with irrigation could be culti-
vated the year round. An indifferent quality of
wheat has been grown, on a small scale, but the
cost of the inadequate experiment was very heavy,
and, anyway, it would not be any use growing grain
without railway communication. A railway from
the Main Transcontinental to Sturt’s Creek would
begin with a revenue of at least £50,000 a year
from cattle alone, and that would be enormously in-
creased if boring for artesian water should prove as
successful as we believe it will be.
When the P.L.L. Conference
refused recently to listen to the
argument that the closing of pubs
in N. S. Wales at six o’clock
would throw a lot of people out of
work, it was a healthy sign that
Labor is getting away from the
horrible fear that there are not
enough jobs to go round. Aus-
tralia’s chief need is people for
jobs; and to make a few more
people available for the jobs that
are necessary, the unnecessary and
superfluous job ought to be sup-
pressed. Yet every interest which
taxes the people to make high
profits has confidently raised a cry
about the unemployment that will
be caused if there is any inter-
ference with its own little swindle:
and Labor lias had the habit of
rising like a fish to the bogus fly
and joining the howl—as the
Clerks’ Union did the other day
when it declared that the introduc-
tion of the totalisator would
throw 1500 bookmakers’ assistants
out of a job.
The Berlin Post points out that
no quarter was given at Ligny in
1815, and suggests that the same
policy may be pursued on a larger
scale now. The reference looks a
trifle unfortunate. Napoleon ham-
mered the Prussians pretty
thoroughly at Ligny.
Yet another Government has been found
with an ear for the howl of the cockies on
the Richmond River (N.S.W.) over, the
water hyacinth pest. Successive . Ministers
have listened to the wail, and replied: “Yes,
yes, something will have to be done; but
leave it to me —I’ll fix it!” The good reso-
lutions never got out of the pigeon-hole.
Minister Hoyle, however, has gone the whole
hog, and promised to introduce a Bill em-
powering a Trust to declare war against the
pest, and to collect the cost from the people
of the district. The Parliamentary party
touring the North Coast opened its eyes to
find cows walking on the hyacinth; but as
much as 20 years ago man and beast crossed
the Richmond River by the same bridge of
living vegetable. Sporadic efforts have been
made to shift the stuff, chiefly by towing
it out to sea in sections; but none were
thorough enough. The curse is another
monument to the importing folly of some-
body in the dim long ago; and the cockies
wouldn’t stand on ceremony if they met the
responsible idiot even in his old age.
The Commonwealth Government is pre-
sumably quite satisfied now that military
courts are not the proper ones to deal with
persons charged with non-military offences.
Of the five men sentenced on charges of
stealing, etc., at Rabaul, three to whom their
military judges gave three years have been
ordered by the Federal Executive to be re-
leased at once, another’s little lot of three
years has been reduced to nine months, and
the fifth’s sentence of four years has been
cut to one year. Thus it seems not only
that the basis on which the terms were fixed
was hopelessly wrong, but that the relative
culpability of the accused was also mis-
judged. From this it may reasonably be
assumed that, in any further legislation
introduced by the present Government, mili-
tary officers will be restricted to the duties
for which their training and environment fit
them and carefully shooed off those jobs for
which the same training and environment
unfit them.
As no member of the Liberal party has
rushed forward to resign his seat in favor
of the defeated A. H. Peake, the ex-Premier
of South Aus. is likely to remain out of
Parliament for some time. It is probable
that a vacancy may occur through resigna-
tion of a member of the Upper House; in
that event the way may be opened for Peake
to return to the Assembly through a member
of the Assembly resigning to contest the
Council seat.
A quaint person signing himself “Eng-
lishman” in Adelaide Advertises insists on
all Australians going to the Front, while he
remains in South Aus. and writes foolish
letters to the press. He advises the women
of S. Aus. to present white feathers, and
insists that tire S.A. Parliament should
get a little Act of Parliament rushed through, and
clear the streets, shops and offices of all who ought
to have volunteered long ag0....N0w is the time for
the Government and the immigration authorities to
distinguish themselves and earn the undying respect
of the homeland, and, more so, the emigrants.
No wonder one type of Englishman gets him-
self disliked the world over. Here, for
example, is a native of the island that will
not even now declare for conscription, talk-
ing of white feathers and impossible State
Acts of Parliament to legalise press-gangs
in a Commonwealth that has long adopted
compulsory service, and that in the teeth of
all the immigrants who condemned it as
“un-British.” It was the same quaint people
who recently started —in the middle of war
—an agitation to break up the Allies by
nominating Albert of Belgium to the
“throne” of France. France hasn’t any
throne; but a little discrepancy like that
didn’t worry the class of Englishman who
wants to reform all foreigners because his
own sty is perfect.
THE BACK FIRE.
“Spasmode” : This will hardly be credited,
but it is a fact. The two colossal statues
of Britannia and Australia, at the entrance
to the Melbourne Exhibition, were both
made in Germany! One was sent for the
exhibition of 1880, the other for that of
1888. To the cynic the most humorous
feature of the whole business is that the
Freetraders and shandygaff Protectionists
who have made Germany by trading with
it now talk loudest about the infamy of
trading with the enemy. It is like a man
who has set his house on fire howling at
another who throws a handful of shavings
into the blaze.
If the assertions of some Victorian publi-
cans are justified it isn’t easy to see why they
oppose the closing of hotels at 6 p.m. Thus,
hotelkeeper Coniff, of Port Melbourne, speak-
ing to the local Labor League, “not as a
publican but as a Laborite,” raved against
the unfairness of treating as an ordinary
shopkeeper the man who has to pay vary-
ing sums to embark in business, and also
licensing fees to be allowed to carry it on.
The proposal would mean ruin to some
Bungs, he added. Then, switching off
on to the usual flapdoodle of the
Trade, he declared that early closing
would not diminish drinking; all the
legislation of the past had failed to
reduce the consumption of liquor. In that
case, why the fuss? If the consumption of
liquor continues as before, the publican will
gain, inasmuch as he will have daily five and
a half hours’ less expense—in lighting, wages,
wear and tear of glassware, sawdust, and
other items. Mr. Coniff will thus gain
largely by the innovation he opposes. Why
is he so unreasonable?
"Togo”: The N.S.W. Government in fix-
ing the price of chaff forgot to remembei
that many holders of chaff also own straw.
These things are closely akin, except in
nourishment; and as there is nothing to pre-
vent blending, nor any means of maintain-
ing a standard of quality, the best thing
buyers can do is to get in on the early doors
before the mixing starts.
OUR GALLANT DEFENDERS.
THE JOHNNY: “Were giving them rats—
what!”
THE OTHER LOAFERS: “My oath , we are!"
A Supreme Court Judge having llung V.
Reed out of the House of Reps., sleepy old
Ray of Islands will for a week or two become
“the front” to all Maoriland. The Parlia-
mentary score stands: Massey 40 (including
the brunette Ilenare who last described him-
self as te plurry Innepen’ent) ; Ward 39.
That, with one to play, looks too close to
be comfortable, for if Joe manages to finish
all square everyone will be in the soup.
There were some quaint patches in Hol-
man’s Brisbane speech. In justifying his
colossal expenditure he said: —
A hundred times over he preferred spending money
in alleviating distress and in improving the condi-
tions of those who needed it than in saving the money
for investment in contemptible assets.
This scorn for “investment” and “con-
temptible assets” is really beautiful. How-
ever, when a politician’s reputation for
extravagance and recklessness is so wide-
spread that he has to visit the capital of
another State to make a long speech in
justification of his spendings, the scorn for
assets is quite understandable. Not one
word of condemnation for borrowings or
huge interest bills or wholesale pawning
emanated from the eloquent Holman; but
the mention of “investment” and “assets”
aroused him to a fury of fluent repudiation.
Charles Duckett, one of the largest hard-
ware importers in Australia, returned to
Melbourne the other day after a long Stay
in the Cold Country, and proceeded forth-
with to throw iced water on some of the
political fashions of the hour. Not 5 per
cent, of the goods to which Australia is now
giving a 10 per cent, preference as British
are all-British, he says. The plain truth is
that in hundreds of cases Australia is not
only still trading in enemy goods—-or goods
that are to all intents and purposes enemy
goods—but it is actually letting them in on
better terms than the goods of France and
other Allies. And the horror will continue
so long as Britain is the Freetrade refuge
for the industrial and commercial sharks of
all the world. What German firm wouldn't
in peace time establish some sort of a depot
in England in order to get the 10 per cent.
Australian preference if the Australian
trade in his particular line was worth
having?
The Unification proposal to be presently
discussed at the Federal Labor Conference
has set the babbling dailies asking one
another how they would like everything
managed as badly as the Post Office. Well,
what is w r rong with the Post Office that
makes it worse than (say) the fish and
fruit supply, which are in the hands of Pri-
vate Enterprise? A letter, addressed to
Pine Creek or Broome, goes the three or
four thousand miles for a penny. Apples,
grown 15 miles out, lie rotting under the
trees, while the city public pays three
ha’pence apiece, for something with a worm
in the middle. Only one letter in 22.000 is
reported as having gone astray, and most
of the reports would probably be withdrawn
next day if the person who says he did the
posting would look through his pockets. For

THE SONG OF A BLOATED CITY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The population of Sydney is now 752,500, being
an increase of 32,300 for the year 1914.
Sing a loud song of large-sized, bumptious joy!
The figures for last year are written down
And show that (cripples, babes, and all) we have
Three-quarters of a million in one town!
Now Melbourne writhes beneath our conquering feet —■
Next year we’ll joke of cows in Collins-street.
The cost of living leaps up like a ’roo,
And people pig six deep in many houses,
And jobs are scarce ; but such great news as this
Within all breasts a civic pride arouses.
So let the Millions clubmen, proud and fat,
Lifting their lids, ask: “What d’yer think of that?”
Let Bings rejoice (he auctions the ripe spuds
Old Blanker grows), and Blinkcrson (whose cart
Has borne them from the railway lumpers’ hands),
And all the others who, upon the mart,
Their living make from sundry extra charges
On Blankcr’s spuds—our city still enlarges 1
Let Smithers cheer (exporting is his line)
And all his kidney, handling wool and ores
And other things too numerous to name,
Which go to make the wealth of other shores
Turned into gold by the skilled worker’s touch—•
And sundry carters, lumpers, clerks, and such.
Let York-street shout —for he brings back the stuff
We sent away, in finished products fashioned.
And let the crowds that help him in his game
Join in his shouting with their cheers impassioned.
Let everyone rise cheering in his place ;
The bloated city still bloats on apace!
We have some little factories, ’tis true,
But mostly live upon the job of shirking
The need for doing things ourselves; we are
A town that hates the thought of really working.
The cost of living rises, but no matter,
For Sydney ev’ry year is growing fatter!

ROOT PILLS.
“I can conscientiously say,” writes Mrs.
Sarah Perkins, Hilda, Gibbs Street, Auburn,
“there is no medicine equal to Dr. Morse’s
Indian Root Pills for relieving indigestion
and constipation. I have taken them for a
long time, and I speak from experience. Fre-
quently I have recommended their use to
personal friends, and I always keep them by
me for personal use when occasion arises.
They are also used by my son. You have my
permission to publish this testimony.”

Blair I. Swannell, killed at the Darda-
nelles, was a splendid type of athletic sportsman. After
hi rL o°i Australia with two English football teams
he remained in Australia and pitched a tent in Syd-
hater on he “represented” with N. S. Wales
(that was 10 years ago) ; afterwards
he excelled as Rugby Union referee, and was secre-
tary of Hi® Metropolitan Union until it was swal-
n 7/ t ! le Union. In spare moments
swannell took a hand coaching young ladies at hockey,
and encouraging the lads in the Sydney Swimming
Club. A. keen.nnhtarist, he whetted his appetite in the
three years S African war, and he entered the pre-
sent tussle with eyes unsealed to the risks of the whole
war business.
Swannell was one of the greatest
treats the Maorilanders ever had in the way of a
visiting footballer. Early in the tour of Bedell-
oi\lights Englishmen in M.L. he jumped to an
agreement with the hard, all-in local style of play,
and what he gave and took after that Was hair and
He ' vas Um team’s distributor of hash. Natur-
ally he got the lion’s share of the return love-tokens,-
and more often than not at the finish of a good
day s play about all that could he seen of the fine
forwards face was a gratified smile dividing a mass
of bruises. He was the most bruised footballer alive
throughout that tour, hut he left behind him
a record that has become a legend in the hardest
Rugby-playing country in the world.
Amongst the Bananaland wounded at the
Dardanelles is Captain J. L. Fisher. He came to
AustraUa as a member of the British Rugby team in
904., Another noted sport who was winged in the
histone scrap was Captain Eric W. Tulloch, of
Melbourne. They know him best amongst the oars-
men, and on several occasions he has decorated a
seat in a State Eight boat.

In 1902 he won the “Members’” and
Affiliated Medal” at the N.R.A. meeting, and the
following year, as one of the Australian team at
Bisiey (Eng.), he made a big hole in the prize-money.
Since then his trade-mark has been a feature of the
bull s-eye. For the past seven years lie sat at the
council of the N.S.W. National Rifle Association, and
much credit should be--passed to him when the present
high standard of rifle-shooting- in the Ma State is
being considered.

The champion wrestler of the fleet in
Australasian waters, Donald Reeday, of the Pioneer
and Pyramus, has been drowned in the North Sea.
He was a Lancashire native, and the wrestling tra-
ditions of liis country lost nothing when he was on
the lob. Over 100 contests are recorded to his
credit, a good few of them won in Australia and
Maori land.

What’s all this parrot chatter about the
sports-player staying at home to kick a football
instead of going to the Front to kick Von Sausage?
In Maoriland 362 toeballers who played last season
in Wellington city alone are with the colors. In
N.S.W. about 700 of the Union’s players have
enlisted, and that’s not the full list of toeballers
m Australasia by chunks. The footballers are doing
their whack, and are likely to keep a good leavening
m the ranks, and so are the men of other sports.
There are, of course, thousands who cannot go to
the wars, no matter liow their desire may con-
sume them, unless the position grew desperate,
when all other considerations would be overrun.
Meanwhile, it is better that they should keep their
bodies fit and in that training which is one of the
nations greatest assets. To many people, including
fat importers whose special stock-in-trade these days
is a handbell and a Union .Tack, it is accredited as
double-distilled callousness that men should be in the
amiable athletic fields at honie while their brothers
are in the damnable fields of war abroad; but such
judgment is out of focus with the truth. The men
who are in the playing fields of Australasia to-day
are not callous, apd, : in the main, anything but
cowards. Not within cooee of being so callous, for
instance, as the wealthy men-about-town who are
neither offering tlieir bodies to the ranks nor ad-
equately buying exemption nor keeping themselves
fit for personal service should the time come when
nothing but personal service will do. For a change,
the agitated peoDle who are nagging at the sports-
men might tackle them.

“The Eighteenth”: While we are waiting
to settle the big argument in Europe we have little
arguments among- ourselves, and the system of settling
them at Liverpool Camp is No. 1. Amongst a mob
of chaps such as we have here rows are bound to
occur, and “Snowy” Baker knew what he was doing
when he donated numerous pairs of boxing gloves as
arbitrators. If two or more blokes have a difference
of opinion the settling business is saved up till after
parade, when there is a wild rush for one of the
many stadiums rigged up in the grounds. The erv
“Fight on” brings men in all stages of dress and
undress to the scene, afid a referee is appointed. The
“scrap” has to be square, and is very promptly
stopped if at all unequal. These settlements are not
confined to any particular time of the day, and I have
held lighted candles for coves to see where to hit
blokes, and vice versa. They're not particular about
small details, the main idea being to get the argu-
ment settled with the maximum spectacular display.
Dick Arnst, who has signified his final
retirement from professional sculling, had a meteoric
rise in Australian sport. Just after he won the “Syd-
ney Thousand” bike race, he got the notion that he
would make a champion sculler, and, where the 99
had failed in their dreams, he succeeded. He began
as an exceptionally raw novice—his early efforts in-
cluded falling out of the boat many times —but
in less than two years he was the world’s sculling
chaippion. Then he roamed the earth in search of
glory and boodle. After he had defeated Barry on
the Zambesi (South Africa) he crossed to England
for a return match, and went flop. The burly
Maorilander also had an idea that he would make a
champion pug, probably reckoning his weight and
size as an asset; but a few lessons let the wind out
of that idea. As a professional cyclist he won many
races in Maoriland; while with the gun he was a
first-class professional shot. Altogether he was one
of the best many-sided athletes Australasia has pro-
duced.

Wesley College crew notched another win
in the Victorian Great Public Schools’ eights over the
Melbourne Henley course last Saturday. Three boats
were left in the final —Scotch College, Geelong and
Wesley. Scotch had the usually favored position on
the south side, Wesley centre, and Geelong the north.
The Wesley crew was the lightest of the three, but
what it lacked in weight it made up for in machine-
like action. Charlie Donald, the Albert Park oars-
man, is responsible for the form invariably displayed
by Wesley crews, and several good judges say that
the winners on Saturday were, if not the best, equal
to any eight Donald has ever turned out. Geelong
looked very rough compared with the Melbourne
crews. Wesley, which got away first, made every
post a winning post, and, though the porridge-eaters
came at them gamely between Branders Ferry and
the finish, the leaders won unruffled by half a length
in smin. 17 3-ssec. —rattling good time. Geelong,
though the heaviest crew of the three, finished half
a length behind the Scotchmen.

“Bumpkin”: Brisbane is making serious
preparations to win the inter-State 18ft. champion-
ship, to be sailed in its own waters next January.
A' local publican has decided to go after the N. S.
Wales and Westralian representatives with a brand-
new argosy, to be built by J. Whereat. His claims
on the job rest on the fact that he is the designer
and builder of the well-known sailer Bulletin.
CHAMPION SPRINTERS AT
FLEMING! ON.
Arthur Postie beats Mick Carter.
A horrible thing has happened to the Sport
of Kings in England. It has lost its amateur status.
In the most open manner it has turned pro. At a
meeting of the Jockey Club the Duke of Westminster
and other sporting noblemen who know something of
the horrors of the Front from personal experience
demanded the total abandonment of racing, while
Lord Rosebery and others who have not been to the
war argued for “sport as usual.” In the end the
club compromised. The gist of its decision was that
racing should be dropped as a sport, but continued
as a business. There are to be no luncheon tents at
Ascot, the Royal enclosure is to be shut up, special
trains are not to run—-the whole picnic element is to
be cut out. Only those who live on the game—the
owners, trainers, jockeys, touts, bookies, tick-tackers,
and, above all, the betting men or Mugs—are to be
catered for. A curious fact was disclosed in the
course of the discussion. Over 100,000 adults
are dependent on racing for a living. That is to say,
the “game” supports this huge number of males of a
fighting age, or thereabouts, who, either from poor
physique or disease, or family circumstances, or cold
feet, can’t, or won’t, enter the army. This was one
of the most powerful arguments advanced on behalf
of the continuance of racing.
* -X- *- *
Curiously candid advt. from the Adelaide
dailies of 26/4/’l5: “For sale, the disappointing
steeplechaser Weerooma (black mare). Apply owner,”
etc. The lady was backed down to even money for
the Gawler Steeplechase on the previous Saturday, in
a field of six, but lost by two lengths. By the
Monday morning she had her character taken away as
above.
* * * «
The Goodwood Handicap at Adelaide was
fought out by two of the straightest-going sprinters in
the business—Golden Wire and lownit. The Wire
rarely fails to give owner Frank Meyers a good run
for his money. In the Newmarket flutter, to be sure,
he and Traquette were notable disappointments, especi-
ally the mare; but in the Bourke Handicap (seven
furlongs), three days later, the, slippery Traquette
had a hard job to beat Golden Wire at even weights,
whilst lownit, the runner-up to Blague in the New-
market, finished a couple of lengths away. This time
the Wire was meeting lownit at a difference of 71b.,
and, with a good start, landed a fat stake for the
stable by a length and a half.
,* * * *
Chortle, the horse that notched an Aus-
tralasian record (2min. 5 l-sscc.) for a mile and
a quarter the other day, when he won the Awapuni
Gold Cup, is one of a string of noted animals that
sprang from Multifid, son of Multiform—Heriot.
The dam of Chortle was Amusement. He showed
every indication of being a splendid hurdler, but his
abilities on the flat induced his owner to leave
hurdling alone—anyhow, for the present.
* * * *
The spirit of the true sport! The black
and white racing colors of the Buckland family,
Maonland, were carried to victory the other day
for the first time in 20 years, though there has
scarcely been a time in the whole period when they
have not had a horse or two in the stable.
Harry Goodman, the well-known Aus-
tral-Maoriland trainer who died the other day at
Chch (M.L.’s pancake city which calls itself
that for short), first crossed the Tasman for the
Loanly Islands to ride Kauri Gum against an Aus-
tralian horse named Falcon for £5OO a side. He
won. Years afterwards he was again entrusted
with a horse named Native Cat to win a £5OO
stake and £5OO in side wagers. The other animal
was Our Pony. This time he didn't bring home the
thing that goes with the eggs. Goodman was steering
winners when his weight was about sst; that was
at Ballarat, when the races used to be “round the
square.’’
* * * *
One of the best cross-country races ever
seen in Maoriland was the Liverpool Steeplechase at
Timaru the other day. The distance was about
three miles, over fairly stiff country, and of the
nine nags that started only one fell. The field
clung together in a remarkable way. From the
last fence Stone Ginger, who had led most of the
way (although it wasn’t much of a lead), fought
out a desperate finish with Fritz and won by a short
head. The Pole was close up third, with the rest
of the field disputing the position with him.
* *- * *
When the mare Warstep put the two
miles of the Trentham Gold Cup behind at Welling-
ton (M.L.) the other day, in 3min. 24sec., she
erected a world’s record for the distance at weight-
for-age, as well as fracturing the Australasian
record. Only once has the M.L. nag’s time been
bettered under any conditions, and that was in 1900,
when the aged English mare Pradella, carrying Bst.
41b., won the Ascot Stakes Handicap in 3min.
19 2-ssec. Warstep had to hump Bst. 121 b.
* * * •
Maoriland horse-pilot .Tames Buchanan,
at the first day of the Auckland Autumn Meeting,
steered no less than five gallopers first past the post
in one afternoon.
* * * *
Another racing curiosity. Two years ago
T. Carmody won the Warrnambool Cup with Prince
Kirk. Last week he won it again with Prince Kirk's
brother, King Kirk. Each won as a five-year-old;
and a horse named Radiator ran second both times.
* * * *
Another argument is raging round the
Davis Cup. Some reckless party recently suggested
that the skipper of an international team should be
compelled to hand in the names of the players 24
hours before the commencement of contest. R.
Wrenn, Uncle Sam’s one-time tennis cham-
pion, lias borrowed G. Washington’s axe to
chop down the proposal. He has, whether
with full authority is not quite clear from
the message, announced that the U.S.A. are
prepared to name their men as a matter of conveni-
ence, but that there should be no rule to compel a
nomination that shall be unalterable earlier than an
hour before play commences. The wrangle is
proceeding.
* * * *
They’ve got a new golf player at Kew
(Vic.) who threatens to brighten up the future. His
name is D. R. Walker, and he has been giving “the
Colonel” something to go on with. After scoring three
4’s and two 6’s up he w’as put on scratch by the
handicappers, and his reply was a 7. up and another
6 up, including a reduction of the club’s stroke
record to 74 (bogey, 80).
B. W. Farquhar, a Sydney batsman wdio
was regarded as a coming international player some
years ago, but who somehow never rose to form
when tested, has, in middle age, blossomed as a
golfer. At Manly, playing* in the Prince of Wales’s
medal competition, he put up a record for the
course and left a field of 80 lamenting, The
Prince of Wales’s medal scheme, whereby only the
Belgian Fund benefits, is becoming very popular.
In this match £lO rolled in to aid the Massacred.

The Australian short-sprint championship
over 50yds., 60yds. and 75yds., between Arthur B.
Postle (Q.) and “Mick” Carter (Vic.), at Melbourne,
was stirring while it whizzed. The 33-year-old Postle
won each of the three heats with less than a foot
to spare, despite a strained leg in the first spin. No
official times were recorded, but private watch-,holders
agreed that “even” time was not broken in any of
the events, the figures being 50yds., 5 2-ssec.; 60yds.,
6 2-ssec. ; 75yds., 7 3-ssec.
* * * *
The wood-cutting pastime or punishment
has been flourishing lately in Australia and Madri-
land. The other day at Liverpool (N.S.W.), Colin
Heckenberg, Ma’s champion, chopped out L. ;G. :
Mclntosh, of Gosford (N.S.W.), for the honor and a
stake of £25. The logs were 15in., and the winner
carved through his in lYJsec. He is now looking for
a match with any bushwhacker in Australia for any
sum.
*** * *
The famous cyclist, Frank Kramer, is
said to be riding with more dash than at any time
in his career, and accounted for such fliers as Goullet
and the Italian Verri with ease in the final of a mile
scratch race at Newark (U.S.) recently. An Ameri-
can speculator is feeling for encouragement to bring
Kramer and a string of other greased cyclists to Aus-
tralia and Maoriland at the beginning of 1916. If
he can make a deal he promises as part of his outfit
some world-famed motor-cyclists whose racing will
raise the scalps of the down-under natives.
*** * •
Another of our Great Natural Resources
has been ruined in Victoria- —or it will be if the
Police Dept, goes on its ruthless way. Goat-racing
is to be stopped. It was a favorite pastime in the
north-east of the State and at various sports gather-
ings, even in Melbourne, greatly tickled the' fancy
of the crowd. At the recent Eight-Hours’ Sports in
the capital a gloom was cast upon the otherwise
joyous William Goat Spurt by the John Dunns taking
the names of the drivers. It appears that it -is an
offence to drive any dog or goat harnessed to a
vehicle, and the section is to be enforced. As the
maximum penalty is £l6O or six months’ imprison-
ment, the slump in goat-racing is sure and sudden.
William will now go out of training and become
beastly fat.

Though the attendances at Melbourne’s
football games remain about normal there wasn’t
quite the usual enthusiasm about Saturday's games,
and the barrackers forbore to heave advice at the
players and insults at the umpire. Black arm-bands
and half-masted flags told their own story. St.
Kilda, with a new and improved team, has done so
well that the local elite motored in crowds to see the
team gallop over Collingwood. For a while it looked
as though the Saints would do it, too; but, in the end,
system beat individual brilliance, and the Magpies
won by 76 points to 56. With three rounds played
Collingwood is the only League team owning the full
competition points. Those ancient warriors, Geelong
and Melbourne, fought for the manyth time on the
M. C. Ground, the home team wiping off one of a
long sequence of defeats by piling up 102 points to
83. A score of 102 was also erected by ’Roy against
’Don, the latter’s reply, of 34, being lamentable.
Richmond, driven back at the start by South, put up
a. stern fight, and regained its trenches and a yard
or two over, in a manner of speaking, winning 69
points to 67. South, however, is not the South of
old; it lias lost its morale and requires stiffening up.
The only Ass. game of moment (it drew some
7600 sightseers) was at Brunswick, where North
got a commanding lead at the start, stalled off all
attacks, and won by 93 points to 68.

There were good attendances at the prin-
cipal football grounds in Sydney on Saturday. The
League commenced its season, and it is estimated
that its principal attraction was surrounded by 13,000
spectators. The Soccer competition was advanced
another stage, and is now led by Granville and Pyr-
mpnt, with four points each. The Rugby Union
players were .not in evidence, excepting at Govern-
ment House grounds, where about a couple of hundred
of them, paraded as a rifle club.
* * * *•
The most exhilarating item on the Rugby
League’s programme on "Saturday was the defeat of
South Sydney, last year’s champions, by Glebe at the
Cricket Ground. Up to the last 10 minutes the scores
were even —seven points each. Then South Sydney
was weakened by the loss of a man through injury.
Maybe this discouraged the defence of S.S. against
the heavy, grinding, if not brilliant, attack of Glebe,
or it encouraged the latter to additional exertions.
Anyhow, two converted tries followed each other
rapidly, and when the supply of time ran out the
score-card showed: Glebe, 17 points; S. Sydney, seven
points. Of the other matches, Eastern Suburbs wiped
the field with Annandale (20 to three), Balmain
and Newtown pegged level (11 points each), and
North Sydney 7 was discourteous to Western Suburbs to
the extent of 10 points to seven.
N.S.W. Rugby Union had a great rally
in its rooms on Saturday night, when Major McMana-
mey (president), Lieut. Middleton (vice-president)
and Corporal Beddie (management committee) were
farewelled ere departing for the Front. McManamev
has been a devoted bulwark of Rugby for about 35
years. Thirty-three years ago he played in the first
inter-State game in Sydney. For 16 years he was
one of Mil’s selectors, and for 20 years he served on
committees of' the Union. Also, he is one of the
best referees that ever blew a whistle. Middleton is
well and favorably known as footballer and oarsman.
Another enthusiast given the good-bye hand on Satur-
day night, by the Manly Club, was A. Buckley 7 , who
has played for it in every competition game since the
15 was admitted to first-grade. He goes to the most
uncivil place on earth these days on business.
* * * *
The English Soccer authorities, following
what is more or less the general rule, are preparing
to reduce the season’s fixtures. The curtailment of-
important matches is estimated to result in a loss of
£1,000;000 in wages. But there are plenty 7 other
jobs going a-begging just now.

At Melbourne Stadium on Saturday night
Gordon Coghill, the tall, lithe Sydney heavyweight,
was offered up as a sacrifice to Tom Cowler, an Eng-
lish heavy 7 with a protruding jaw and a right swing
like the kick of a mule. Coghill weighed 13st., and
Cowler list;. 81b. The men were unevenly matched,
and even before hostilities commenced it looked a
million to a gooseberry on Cowler, who towered over
his opponent. Early in the opening round Cowler
landed a clean right-swing to the jaw, which sent the
Australian down for 9sec. That was the beginning
of the end. The puncher from abroad allowed the
affair to drag on for three rounds, when Coghill’s
henchmen skied the towel and lifted their out-classed
principal to his corner. Every time Cowler landed
a well-timed right to the jaw Coghill was either
lifted to the ropes or deposited on the floor. In
brief, he spent most of the time in taking nine
seconds’ rest and picking himself up carefully. The
wonder is that he managed to regain the perpendicu-
lar after the first punch. The result could not have
surprised the management, for it had another contest
ready as balm to the feelings of an obviously disap-
pointed house. Incidentally, a couple of Coghill’s
ribs were broken during the exchange of civilities and
on Monday it was hospital for him.

Henri Demleri, the Belgian, met Billy
McNab, of. the pink hair, at Sydney Stadium on
Saturday- night. After a fierce struggle, in which the
rufous Maitland lad tried hard, only to be baulked
by the .pallid stranger, referee Harald Baker placed
a white and sinuous hand upon our foreign visitor’s
brow. A good, clean fight between a couple of game
and experienced boys.
*‘* * *
How .Uncle Sam conducts his “sport”
with the gloves, according to one of his-well-known
right-writers, J. S. Kelly:—“Boxing’ club managers
. .. .book- some big star fighters, who work cheap
when they can pick soft marks—often kids
who hardly know how to put their hands up. It is
the absolute duty of all Boxing Commissioners who
have the welfare of the manly art at heart to stop
all advertised bouts where a skilful boxer is pitted
against a lemon or some young novice. Most every
night in the week y 7 ou can see a top-notcher beating
some poor slob into subjection, in order to show
what a wonderful boxer he is. I can recall many
cases of this kind that were simply cowardly, and
disgusting. Many of the referees would willingly
stop these one-sided bouts, but they are directly
under the. control of the club that hires and pays
them their fee. If they stopped some of these
uneven affairs tiny would probably lose their jobs.”

President Spence, the head serang of
N. S. Wales bowlerdom, who was lately operated on
to disconcert an Old enemy, has now almost recovered,
and expects shortly to take his place on the mat.

“T.F.”: Hundreds of attempts have been
made to put life into cricket—but they’ve all sizzled
out. Years ago a wild-brain suggested that four
stumps should be used instead of three, but he was
laughed back to his thistles. The downward drift
in Sydney cricket began about the time of the visit
of Warner’s team, when the Englishmen were too
haughty to play in a Scotch mist. The umpires
hadn’t the backbone to make them toe the crease,
and the public found amusement in howling like
boiling demons and throwing empty beer bottles on
to the .Sydney Cricket Ground. Thousands walked
awaj 7 with contempt for the pastime, and have not
altered their opinions yet. Then followed the rumpus
between “The Players” and the Board of Control, the
outcome of which was that the Australian XI had a
second-rate brand writ large on its kits. “The
Players” clinched the longest nail in the cricket
coffin. The “new bloods” who put on “The Players’ ”
boots haven’t unearthed one batsman capable of
attracting a crowd.
INone of the topnotchers from Britain
being available, Alcock’s are opening the billiard
season at their Melbourne hall with an exhibition
match between the Lindrum brothers—Fred and
U alter. Some people would prefer to see either
Lindrum pitted against an outsider; but Fred, who
is still a young man, and Walter, who is very
young, represent the best Australian talent, and to
amateur critics of the game the long battle will be
interesting study. It started last Monday and will
last a fortnight.
There was a lovely hue and cry at Waito-
tara the other night, at the close of the Maori
sports, when it was discovered that the entire
“gate,” worth £67, had disappeared. That was
no good to Henare, and every brown man in the
township turned himself into' a Sherlock Holmes.
Even the police got busy. The local John
Hop was the first to arrest a clue, and
he pursued it until four o’clock the next morn-
ing, when he recovered the missing cash. A Maori
had it buried carefully in the back yard. He stated
that the money in a bag had been handed but of a
window in the pavilion at the sports ground, and
had been taken away by him and planted (so that
it wouldn’t get lost, presumably); The very scared
brown man protested that it' was all “a plurry
joke,” and the harassed brown committee was so
pleased to see the . cash again that it promptly
accepted the explanation.

By the grace of John Bull and Norton
Griffiths there should still be fat profits and
dividends in this co. for a few years to
eome. After, that all depends on whether
another money-lender will come forward and
further postpone the day when N. S. Wales
will have to live within its means. All
past experience shows that when loans are
cut off at the meter, and the State, feeling
very sick, settles down to pay interest aiid
repay principal, cos. in the building-supply
and construction line slacken off horribly.
Even in 190 G this co. was paying less than
4 p.c. For the present, however, it has a
ready market, and is making the most of
it. Further, it is fortunate in having an
almost inexhaustible supply of gravel,
washed down by the Nepean. Its blue
metal quarries are, of course, being gradu-
ally whittled away; but ample depreciation
appears to be allowed for.
Some idea of the wonderfully good wicket
the co. has been on may be got from this
comparison:—-
Dec.,’o9. Dec.,’l4.
Liquid assets .. .. £6Bll £21,244
Liabilities .. .. 3353 1,667
Surplus assets .. £3458 £19,577
After paying divs. ranging from 10 to 20
p.c. on very much watered capital, and pay-
ing for all renewals, etc., the co. thus in five
years puts by £16,119, mostly cash —-equal
to 50 p.c; of the capital as it was in 1909.
Certainly there may have been a small
shrinkage in the value of the properties; but
it is almost negligible. “Sales of metal
screenings, sand and gravel” for the latter
lmlf of 1914 were £29,661, whereas for the
six months to December, 1909, they were
£16,426. Expenses in that time have in-
creased from £12,177 to £21,036. Which
raises the question, will the exes, fall back
to their old level when the sales slacken off?

The half-year’s loss includes £4594 written
off against depreciation. It also includes
the money spent on development. What
that amounts to is not specified. The Work-
ing account is, in fact, quite unintelligible.
According to the manager’s report 24,178
tons of tailings and slimes were despatched
during the year; but the Working account
does not mention the receipt of any revenue
from that product. On the other side there
is this item: “Cessation expenditure, includ-
ing wages, salaries, repairs and mainten-
ance.” Presumably it cost something to
despatch the tailings and slimes, and that
surely isn’t “cessation expenditure”—which
is an absurd term, anyway. The loss re-
ferred to above is apparently independent of
any that may be made on the optioned pro-
perties. Six months ago “properties under
option” weke reckoned an asset worth £758;
now the item has grown to £3368. General-
manager Ward is testing a reputedly big
low-grade proposition at Misima, St. Aig-
nan’s, off Papua, and he has till October 30
to find out if it is worth the money. It is
doubtful Avliether he will be able to expose
the requisite reserves within the time; but
as the people who gave the option are very
good friends of the people who took it. an
extension may at least be hoped for, if it
should be needed. If the option is turned
down there will be a bit more loss incurred
this half-year to write off. What with the
money spent on trying to develop more ore,
and £2075 spent on further air-compressor
plant, and the £3OOO-odd spent at Misima,
the liquid assets are being bitten into
fast. Twelve months ago they were
£97,613 in excess of liabilities. Since then,
though only £12.500 has been paid out in
dividend, the surplus has come down to
£66,834. In other words, the co. has in 12
months spent £15.279 more than it has
earned, not reckoning divs. as expenditure.
In the same period the acting manager
reckons that the ore reserves have been
maintained at 228,900 tons. In ordinary
circumstances that is a trifle over two
years’ supply. But ore will be scraped up
to last a good deal longer than that, though
costs will be high.

Dust, which once sent a lot of miners into
the local sanatoriums and cemeteries, has
been considerably abated in the last 12
months at Ivalgoorlie and Boulder. In fact,
as a result of the co-operation of Govern-
ment inspectors and mine managers, the im-
provement effected in some instances has
been wonderful. Winzes have been sunk,
brattice doors put in, ventilation shafts pro-
vided, pipe-lines run along levels, and the
once-barred use of water for dust-laying en-
couraged. It lias been expensive; but the
money won’t be wasted —it will come back
to the cos. in the shape of improved ser-
vices.

81st ANNUAL REPORT of the DIRECTORS of the BANK of AUSTRALASIA.
WITH THE ACCOUNTS FOR THE HALF-YEAR TO OCTOBER 12, 1914.
Presented to the Proprietors at the Annual General Meeting held on Thursday, March 25, 1915.
REPORT.
The Directors submit to the Proprietors the balance-sheet as at October 12 last, with the profit
account for the half-year to that date. After providing for rebate on bills current, for British and Aus-
tralasian rates and taxes, and after making provision for bad and doubtful debts and other contingencies,
the net profit for the half-year amounted to £220,509 11s.
To this sum must be added £94,065 17s. 6d. brought forward from the previous half-year, making
a total of £314,575 Bs. 6d., out of which the Directors have declared a Dividend for the half-year at
the rate of 14 per cent, per annum, or £2 16s. per share, and a Bonus at the rate of 3 per cent,
per annum, or 12s. per share, together £3 Bs. per share, free of income tax.
The dividend and bonus will absorb £170,000, and the Directors have further appropriated £20.000
to the reserve fund, and £lO,OOO in reduction of the cost of bank premises. There will then remain
£114,575 Bs. 6d. to be carried forward to the next account.
The dividend and bonus will be payable in London and in Australasia on March 26.
The Directors have to record, with much regret, the death of their esteemed colleague, the Hon.
Sir Chas. W. Fremantle, 1v.C.8.
The Directors retiring by rotation are: The Rt. Hon. Lord Aldenham, The TU. Hon. Lord George
F. Hamilton, and C. G. Hamilton, Esq., who, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election.
The Proprietors will be asked to approve the election, as a Director, of Mr. Horace Peel, in place of
the late Mr. Leslie Sanderson.
The Auditors, Messrs. Welton, Jones and Co., offer themselves for re-election.

AVe have examined the cash and securities in London, and the London books, and have verified the
transfers from the several branches in the Commonwealth and New Zealand, and we beg to report that,
in our opinion, the foregoing is a full and fair balance-sheet of the bank, and that it exhibits a true anu
mrvwt. view of the state of the bank’s affairs as shown by the books. The investments were valued, so far
correct view of the state of the bank’s affairs as
as could be ascertained, at market price or under.

Over-run : This paper lias a lot of doubt
whether the N.S.W. Necessary Commodities Commis-
sion deserves any credit for knocking out the charges
for butter-boxes and the cartage of the fat from the
-wholesale to the retail stores. So far as it,has gone,
the Commission is mostly a device for letting the
bloated city take a further bite out of the country ;
and until it becomes a great deal more profitable to
live in the.country it won't be much use cursing the
Congestion policy. When some Government arises
which will show the country' how to take bigger
bites out of the city, this paper, as an anti-Congcs-
tionist, will feel much more inclined to give three
cheers.... Blank File: Unless you write plainly,
young man, there is nothing doing.... Rango: When
the war has ended —or the raw has mended. It's
all the same... .Pepperina: Do your own libelling.
. ...G.R.8.: Yes, if. the matter is of interest. But
keep to the point,.. .Warrior: The Ottoman Turks
came from Central Asia in 12:27. They settled near
Krzerum under Sulieman Shah.... Old Subscriber: No
■one is searched for opium on arriving in either
Loudon or Paris. As a matter of fact, London shares
with Edinburgh the distinction of making more
opium than any other city in the w0r1d.... Rolyat:
Opinions differ. Most geologists think that Aus-
tralia’s artesian bores are fed by intake beds, and
that when the containing rock is pierced the moisture
flows up under pressure. Dr. Gregory, who, being
imported to these parts, had to proffer something
different from the home-grown geologists, suggests
that the bores are not supplied by impounded rain
water, but come from the older rocks, and are shot
up by gas pressure. Most probably this is rubbish.. ..
Rob (M.L.) : Have a dark suspicion that Massey, in
dealing with his friend the prosperous cocky, knows
that 11 votes go to the ton of interference and 275
to the ounce of sitting still. Therefore old Bill'
sticks on his hunkers La Rue: Thanks; we’ll tell
“Mulga” that the war-whoop, “Let ’er go, Galla-
gher,” sprang out of the French exhortation to the
slave-crews in the galley races—-“ Vogue la gait re.”
... ..Laurus: If you can’t be brightly insane, try to
be natural, and write of things as they are....
M.B.P. (V.) : Keep on trying. The lady in the tram
may reach the terminus. Patriotic verses cast in an
awkward form; the effect is spasmodic and undig-
nified. .Bellerive: The supernatural item:—-
Batch 11.
... . SJowheart: It threatens to be interesting, but
never quite i 5.... A.G.8.: Good idea, but you lack
the skill to work it 0ut....J.M.: “The Kangaroo’s
Tail” doesn’t make good . poetic, soup... .R.M.Y.:
Can’t discern anything worth while in last batch....
Frank J. D.: Afraid we’ll have to worry along with
the old song J.W.McL.: Not B. matter. Might
have a chance, in a local paper.,. .Bill B.: Yes, but
the bagman leaves in a very uninteresting way....
Sidney M.: It is practically a Chant of Hate, and
Chants are off. They were never really 0n...,

... .Platoniari : Yarn hardly moves.. . .L.A.G.: Your
touch is feeble. .. .A. R.C.: A little thin....D.A.
(W.A.): The first page develops a yawn, and that’s
a bad sign. .. .A.D. (Q.) : The “scrap of paper” has
been so scribbled over that anything more on the
subject has to be very distinctive to take the eye
A.H.W.: Such poems can’t help anybody. You would
weary the best-ifitentic&.ed charity audience with one
verse of it .'.. .Mallee^Hen: Returning MS. Bright
little thing, but not quite wlwt we want.... Les 0.:
Verses entitled to honorable mention... ..Johnkenedi:
Too much kid....Pirt: Poem requires a lifting-jack,
and we haven’t one in the office H.F.8.: You bring
out the pathos of whisky, but why not publish the
glowing, red-nosed thing in your own cold climate?
... .A Worm of a Poet: Turn, Worm! turn and crawl
furiously towards the garden!... .E.J.O’C.: Not a
bad idea, but it’s, too obvious. Gamp item is old:
. ...M.R.G.: Verses have a nice cutting edge, b(|t we
would like some on a newer topic.. . .Kaiser B. GWar
rhyme very spirited. It is a pity it cannot keep

note :
Mho dares to sing of these fearful days must tune
his harp in Hell,
And when he tells what the nation pays must show
his power right well;

And towards a pool did stray
The witness wise did recognise
Poor Fisher had met foul play.
Stirred by the news the local police
The deep water hole did drag
And brought to light an awful sight
Of a corpse in a slimy bag;
Vengeance upon the murderer fell
Which he’d evaded a lengthy time.
He stood his trial in the old fashioned style
And was hung for the terrible crime.
THE WAR LORDS.
Why roundelays in fulsome praise
Of merciless men of war,
Whose godless ways the fairest days
Make hideous days of gore?
Is vict’ry’s thrill anent the kill
Worth the perished lives?
Men in their prime! What of the crime?
What of their weeping wives?

TYRES
ENDURING
as becomes Britishers
A TREAD of the toughest and most resilient rubber
ever “ cured,” and a more generous depth of it than
is to be found in most tyres—
Fabric walls of sturdy strength, woven from finest
Egyptian yarn and proofed with pure Para —
Super-strong beads fitting snugly and distributing
strain with scientific nicety—
These are some of the reasons why British AVON
TYRES achieve comfort and safety in the highest degree,
endurance to the furthest limit, economy that motorists
can definitely trace in “ pounds, shillings and pence.”

TO TAKE OFF SEVERAL POUNDS OF
FAT FROM HIPS AND ABDOMEN.
HERE IS A HARMLESS RECIPE THAT
NEVER FAILS.
So many reports have come in of suc-
cessful results from the use of a recently
published herbal recipe for dissolving super-
fluous flesh from the exact places one desires
to be thin that we repeat same below for
the benefit of other readers. Get from yoiur
chemist one dram of quassia chips and three,
ounces of cirola bark extract. Put the
quassia chips in a pan and pour over them
a teacupful of boiling water. In about half
a. minute strain through a cloth and add the
cirola bark extract. Apply night and morn-
ing wherever you think less fat would im-
prove your appearance. This is a most
effective means for getting rid of a double
chin, large hips or abdomen and fat neck
and arms.
CAUTION.—Care should be taken not to
apply on any part where it is not desired to
reduce flesh *
IN BANANA LAND
C. W. Costin, Clerk of the Legislative
Council, has been hard hit: his only son, a
bright young fellow, perished at the Darda-
nelles. Another bright Queenslander killed
was Lieutenant Haymen, whose father
manages the head office of the Q.N. Bank.
Both leave Uni. and other mates and
mourners in plenty.
Ex-Curator De Vis, who passed out re-
cently, had been in charge of the Brisbane
Museum for 40 years ; and by that time he
seemed akin to the fossils he had tended so
efficiently. The devastating climate cut him
down at the age of 87. A short time ago
the Courier’s death notices for one morn-
ing recorded the passing of seven citizens of
ages ranging from 67 to 80 years. If the
good die young, Bananaland must swarm
with sinners.
Attached to the Queensland military camp
at Enoggera is an isolation hospital for the
treatment of soldiers suffering from venereal
disease. Sixteen patients, sick of the mono-
tony, recently 'cleared off for a holiday,
which varied from a few hours to a day or
two. They were promptly hauled up,'and
their names, with full details of their ail-
ments, were blazoned forth in more than a
column of daily-paper print. Of course it
was right that they should be prosecuted
an( l punished for breaking camp. That was
a military offence. But what in the name
of fair play had the fact that these young
fellows had contracted a disease to do’ with
the case?. Why should their suffering be
thus published to the world, while hundreds
of men who deserve far less well of their
country are not only not branded as dis-
eased,, but are not even isolated?
Major J. W. Hamilton, killed near the
Dardanelles, must have been one of the
biggest inen in the Australian Division.
He kept going for 6ft. 3|in., and was framed
in proportion. His first military experience
was as a sapper in the old corps of Sub-
marine Miners at Brisbane. There he rose
to sergeant’s rank and got a commission in
the Moreton Regiment (now the 7th In-
fantry). On being transferred to Melbourne
(his civilian job was that of a clerk in the
Intents Office) he joined the Sixth, was
posted as captain to the Intelligence Corps,
and ordered to Queenscliff. From there he
went to Egypt. The giant Majfir was a
great rowing man for 20 years or so, and
was manager for the Victorian crew on its
last visit to Queensland, he being secretary
of the V.R.A. at the time. There’s a widow
and a little daughter. He was 45.
“Ilan” : Even the Tory crowd in Banana-
land generally admits that Labor-leader
Ryan is the brainiest man in the State’s
public, life. Physically he is strong, is in
the prime of life, possesses an agreeable per-
sonality, and owns a rich voice. I have sat
in the galleries of three Australian Parlia-
ments and can remember no leader who
showed the same capacity for keeping his
head. He never gets into the gutter of
abuse; he is courteous even when busy
cutting his opponent’s throat. By trade he
is a barrister, and his training has no doubt
helped him both to get at the innards of
things and to marshal his facts when he
has arrived there. Contrast him with
“Bishop” Barnes, for instance, Denham’s
lieutenant. The “Bishop,” who delights in
that handle, is one of the wonders of
Bananaland’s public life—among other
things for his great capacity for talking a
long time without saying anything. He is
excellent as a Sunday-school teacher, admir-
able as a local preacher, and magnificent
as the amiable citizen entertaining the
crowd at a bun struggle; but as a politician
of Cabinet rank —well, the thing seems in-
credible, even to his best friends. Yet there
are no less than three of these wonders in
the Denham team now up for sentence.
Though unsuitable for white men of over
who are suffering from measles, the
climate of Queensland doesn’t seem to hurt
hens. Forty teams of layers, engaged in
a 12-months’ egg-dropping competition at the
Government Agricultural College, spent so
much time at work That it is claimed they
rV.mo P a world ’ s record. They deposited
202 eggs, an average of 226 per bird.
Ihese figures should stand for at least a
week.
“Norbell” : There’s a great deal too much
casualness about the Australian. The other
day, at Blackall, I filled the water-bag with
rain-water from a tank. Afterwards I
heard that the water in that tank had been
condemned some time back as unfit for
consumption. My mate is now in the Emer-
ald public hospital with typhoid, and the
doctor says that if he recovers he will be laid
up for eight weeks. Of course I don’t know
whether he caught the fever at Blackall.
Maybe, the disease was collected at another
town where we were a few days previously.
The doctor there told me that he had shifted
his quarters from one pub because the well
of drinking-water was between two cesspits
which had been in constant use for
years. He couldn’t shift the cesspits; he
didn’t have enough dynamite.
IN PUSH SOCIETY.
GINGER: “Hoot’s the matter wiv
Snorkey?”
RENNO : “ Oh,youjust missed a treat!
He tried to take a tray from a blind
cove root wasn't blind.”
“The Crown” lias struck an extraordinary
tenant. At Longreacli a grazing selector
approached the Land Court and begged to
have his rent raised l The Court is speech-
less, yet.
The most secure Liberal candidate run-
ning in Queensland is Stodart, Chairman of
Committees, who, hasn’t made a single speech
in the last five years in the Assembly. A
decent fellow, but unspeakably stodgy in his
views, he exactly suits his unspeakably
stodgy constituency, the Logan,
Manager Rigby, of the Brisbane branch-of
the South British Insurance Co., of Maori-
land, has been hard hit by the war. One
son, a lieutenant, was killed at the Dar-
danelles, a second was wounded. But the
old man bears it, as a man should, bravely
and proudly.
The strangest political speech ever made
in Brisbane was that delivered by Holman.
It was a long apology for N. S. Wales finan-
cial extravagance, and scarcely contained an
allusion to local politics. The object of the
oration was “to assist the Queensland Labor
party” in its contest. Evidently the report
of the Holman spendings was lying like a
log on the chest of Ryan and his followers —
which, when you come to think of it, is some-
thing to their credit.
The Red Knight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Red-handed to the; harvest, 10, I come,
Across the swelling curve of hill and plain.
No touch may guide my lawless charger’s
rein,
While, at the distant thunder of my drum,
Many a pallid mouth is stricken dumb.
The fury of my passage sears the grain ;
Murder with rapine rife; and yet again.
Amid affray, strange joy I bring for some.
“God damn all war!” the shrinking sophist
cries.
Ah ! scorn me not, for oft in ancient days,
When love of conquering became a lust.
I was the curb. Until the tiger dies
In man, I must survive if but to raise
Honor’s white body through the battle dust.'
QUEENSLAND.
A. GORE-JONES.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, May 8, 1915.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
V hat a far-seeing mob of seven-for-six-
penee politicians this suffering country has
had to be proud of. I don’t know whether
I'm more ashamed or indignant to tell you
that the knitted goods our busy Red Cross
workers are making for Tommy Kangaroo
arc of German wool. In the drapers’
shops in Brisbane the same story is told :
“That’s all the wool we have, and we don’t
know when we’ll get any more.” Thus have
we supplied the Germans with the silver
bullet to slaughter us. No wonder the Berlin
authorities showed special consideration to
Australian prisoners of war. I expect the
special consideration took the form of put-
ting them in a nice, well-padded lunatic
asylum.
Our newest substitutes, for royalty con-
tinue to move about amongst the peasantry
without the least embarrassment or sign of
condescension. On Tuesday night, at the
Red Cross concert organised by Mrs. P. J.
Symes, liis Ex. brought along his best mili-
tary eye, and, having fixed it on the accu-
mulation of female, urged the abandonment
oi all personal feeling in favor of a general
enthusiasm for Red Cross work or any such
helpful business. Several dames in the
audience gave each other the coldly ominous
glint while his Ex. was talking, as if each
suspected the other of having whispered
stories of recent disagreements into the
vice-regal ear.
The Albert Hall was crowded, the pro-
gramme was excellent, and Leo Morgan
coaxed £53 out of a by-no-means-wealthy
audience when auctioning a photograph of
Lord Kitchener. Altogether, over £lOO will
go to the Red Cross funds, which ought to
give Mrs. Symes and Miss Mactaggart a
peaceful rest for a night or two. Towards
the dramatic part of the show Mrs. Symes
and pretty Miss Lottie Bond delivered a
scene from “The Merchant of Venice,” Mrs.
Symes recited a patriotic poem, Miss Bond
(with a juvenile lead) played a comedietta,
Gladys Frost rippled some entrancing
melody off the keys of a pianoforte, Betty
Cockburn balanced three songs on a golden
contralto voice, Miss Jean Mactaggart also
lifted up her pleasing voice in song, Mrs.
Stuart and her three daughters earned much
kudos for their Peer Gynt suite, and other
entertaining citizens helped to waft the
hours pleasantly away until lobster-and-
stout time.
On Friday night, when the Trinity Col-
lege certificates were distributed by Lady
Goold-Adams to the usual infant prodigies
and pig-tailed misses,, the Boss again made
a plea that every man, woman and child
should do a little bit towards the great and
urgent cause. He said that what made
Germany a hard foe to beat was that,
throughout the nation, everyone was work-
ing towards a single end. His Ex. made a
sympathetic reference to the relatives of
those who have answered their last roll-call,
as well as of those who have been wounded.
Incidentally, he mentioned that both he and
his wife had themselves suffered anxiety
and pain during the last few months.
On Monday the Queensland Kennel Club
and the Ladies’ Kennel Club held a com-
bined show in aid of the Belgian, Servian
and Polish relief funds. Over £lOO was
gathered in. The Goold-Adams pair was
there. Each of them has a special joy in
horses and dogs.
President W. H. Campbell, his hospitable
wife and his good-looking daughter enter-
tained the members of the Art Society at
a river trip on the Lucinda to-day. The
weather was perfect, the band was fine and
the afternoon tea was in a class by itself.
Need I assure you that everyone enjoyed
the party?
Quite a lot of children have been working
for the Belgians. To-night Mrs. Dick Bil-
lington’s two buds are stage-managing a
fete, and next Saturday Mrs. Ivan Bond’s
small daughters are billed to do something
similar.
A doll fete, which threatens to surpass
all similar chivoos, is being arranged by
three popular ladies, Mrs. Frank Wilson.
Mrs. Percy Rylance and Mrs. Richards.
Unless stopped by Act of Parliament or
Providence it is to happen on June 12, and
is to help buy a motor-ambulance for the
Australians on the battlefield.
The Recreation Room for Soldiers has
been given several lifts. About £ll5 in
cash is available, and Brisbane firms are
tumbling in with material and labor free.
Anyone who wants to hand out a few easy
chairs, or a writing table, or a bookcase
lias only to mention the fact to Mrs. Frank
Little or to treasurer Robertson.
Osmer B. Ward, who general-manages
Block 10 at Broken Hill, is at present test-
ing a mining proposition at Misima, a coral
patch within the Papuan territory. Misima
sees an outside boat once a month, and its
white population could only produce a
quorum of 12 if the bell rang. The native
population is given to very, little in the way
of clothes, being content with a few shells
or something of the kind. Mrs. Ward, who
spent a month on the island with her hus-
band a while ago and then returned to her
Broken Hill home, is on her way back to
her marooned better half.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
Times may be bad in Brisbane ; none the
less the city is just opening its finest theatre,
the Tivoli, and two of Queen-street’s best
business blocks are being transformed into
gorgeous picture shows. In spite of war and
drought, the pinch is not yet felt in Queens-
land.
How the trouble began. The Courier of
just 50 years ago said :
A large and valuable consignment of rabbits of
various new and excellent breeds, from the Royal
Society of Brussels, have just arrived, and are in
excellent condition after their voyage. The council
[of the Acclimatisation Society] proposes in the
spring to turn loose one, or perhaps two, lots of the
silver-grey breed. The other varieties promise to
breed freely, and it is expected that during the
next three or four months surplus stock can be sold.
The silver-grey breed has come up to expec-
tations all right.
The so-called Liberals in Queensland
have been at their old game of posing as
the party which believes in the Empire and
stands for Patriotism. It was a dangerous
card to play, for it provoked the Labor
crowd to produce the story told in The
Bulletin about the dredges imported not
long ago fr’om Germany, and the bridge for
which only a couple of years back the patri-
otic empire-builders paid the Germans good
hard-borrowed Australian money.
Of some battlers of the Bush :
I was journeying by train from Alpha to Emerald
the other day, and several school kiddies shared my
compartment. They lived 32 miles from Alpha, so
they had to travel 64 miles daily to attend school—
-320 miles of railway per week. The train leaves
Alpha at 5 p.m., when up to time, which happens
occasionally, and the youngsters are then lucky if they
get home by ' eight o’clock. When we got to Bogaii-
tungan, about 9 p.m., another little lot of children
looked in at the open door. They didn’t get to
their destination (Willows) until 10 minutes to 10-
dead beat ahd down and out. A six-year-old told me
she had left home at nine that morning, and had
carried the day’s rations with her. I had a job to
wake her when she reached her station. I asked a
boy when he did his “home’’ lessons. He said his
best chance was in the train on the way to school.
Colonel Foster, R.E., who is supposed to
be teaching us Military Science in Sydney
Uni., writes in a local paper:—
An English airman commented to a friend of mine
on the terror inspired by our airmen, and said:
“When one of ours goes up any Germans in sight
disappear.”
As regards cavalry, we get convincing proof that
the Germans will not face our horsemen.
As to artillery, it was, of course, well known
before the war that the German field gun was dis-
tinctly inferior to that of the French and British.
The War Office has stated officially: “Our infantry
has proved itself superior in every respect to that
of the enemy. They have no chance against the
British infantry either in attack or defence.”
Thus Colonel Foster supports and promul-
gates his comfortable theory that Germany
will be smashed in six months—a theory
which gives every slacker an excuse to stand
aside and let the other man take whatever
chances are going!

not a sign of dandruff in my hair, and it has grown longor and thicken You can rest
assured that I will do what I can towards inducing my friends to try your wonderful

A skirmish with a war flavor about it
was the subject of a recent communique to
the Hawthorn (Vic.) magistrates. The
censored report briefly stated that Marie
Louise, a visitor to the suburb, had
become acquainted with a male per-
son, and that the male person's wife,
who was merely Eliza Mary, had
hired a lady friend to hold Marie Louise
while she —Eliza, to wit —with a pair of
scissors removed half of Marie’s beautiful
head of hair. The coil was produced in
evidence, and the Court was much moved
thereat and fined Mary Eliza £5. But who
cares? That won’t put the cat’s beautiful
fur back on her scalp; and Mary Eliza’s
husband will have to pay the five pounds,
anyhow—and serve him right, too!
“J.”: War in the past has been waged
with an extraordinary amount of decency,
all things considered. I knew a man who
was wounded and captured by the Boers.
The thing he most deplored losing, after his
liberty, was a Purdy shot-gun. I said: “I
wonder they didn’t shoot you for having a
shot-gun with you.” He was surprised.
“Oh,” he said, “the Boers knew we wouldn’t
use shot-guns against them,. I had it for
shooting game on the veldt.” That is the
proper _ professional spirit. The German,
with his hideously methodical rapings, his
equally methodical mutilation of French and
Belgian boys, and now his apparatus for
asphyxiating the enemy, is not a soldier as
the term has been understood. He is a
cross between a homicidal chemist and a
ghoul.
_ “J.G.”: The Broadford (Vic.) Shire Coun-
cil lately hacked down about two miles of
beautiful native trees growing on the Sydney-
road, and planted in their place miserable-
looking planes. These will take about 20
years to grow to decent size, and then will
be ugly and, as shade trees, poor things com-
pared with the local gum. At present
travellers along the Sydney-road can strike
three stretches with the finest natural
avenues in the world—between the top of the
Dividing Range and Kilmore, then between
Ivilmore and Broadford, and next between
Broadford and Tallarook. These sections
are a joy to all travellers. The whole length
of the road from the Dividing Range to be-
yond Seymour was at one time fringed with
native trees, but the huge gaps made in the
avenue bear pathetic witness to the fre-
quency with which Huns have been elected
to the local shire councils.
“Principal” Fraser, the parson from
Colombo who is preaching a Black Aus-
tralia in his white host’s house, announced
in St. Paul’s Cathedral (Melb.) the other
Sunday evening that the Belgians were
reaping the seed they had sown in the
Congo. Presumably Fraser means that the
Gerhog is an instrument of God —or pos-
sibly really is God’s partner —and that the
Almighty’s agent ravishes women, murders
infants, destroys churches and outrages
nuns who never had any more to do with
the alleged Congo atrocities than Fraser
had himself. A cheerful kind of God to
offer to the millions of India! And, any-
how, according to Fraser’s theory, the
Congo natives no doubt suffered for some
previous transgression that they had been
guilty of; so where is the injustice, from
his grim point of view?
An Equity suit in Sydney lately insti-
tuted by one Everingham against the Pen-
rith Council relating to land in that neigh-
borhood awakened echoes of the First Fleet.
The. Everinghams are amongst the oldest
families on the ILawkesbury and Nepean.
The pioneer came to Port Jackson in the
ship Scarborough, and was amongst the
first settlers on Australian land. He is
described in the old records as having pre-
viously been an attorney’s clerk. A grant
was made him on July 18, 1791, of 50 acres
situate at “the Ponds, two miles north-
east of Parramatta.” Captain Tench, one
of Australia’s early historians, visited him
on this farm, and wrote: “The attorney’s
clerk I thought out of his province ; I dare
believe that he finds cultivating his own
land not half so easy a task as he for-
merly found that of stringing together vol-
umes of tautology to encumber or convey
that of his neighbors.” Everingham sold
this farm, went on to the Hawkesbury, and
was drowned on Christmas Day, 1817. He
left numerous progeny, a common virtue
of the settlers in that district. To-day
there are Everinghams all over Australia.
Just a rough picture of the real thing—■
pencilled in a convalescents’ retreat :
Here a week ago. A sort of final stage through
the drafting pens, where one can practise crutch
work and give an imitation of trying to get strdng
again. All on sticks here —about 150. Lost mine at
i , but hung on for a week, till they dumped me
in a hospital at the base and then it had to come
off, just above the knee. I’ve only a confused re-
collection of what happened. We got among them
just after dawn —a short run, then down behind
some boulders, and then in. They had to wait, poor
devils. The flanking machine-guns got those who
ran. It lasted about ten minutes. At the time it
seemed to be lasting all day; but we were “all out”
pretty quickly, for it’s mighty strenuous—something
not unlike a vicious scrum at football, its intensity
multiplied by a hundred. I can’t recollect the start,
but I remember being suddenly up against a chap
who had thrown his overcoat and jacket off. He
lunged at me from the side before I saw him. But
he missed; and the first thing I knew was the
barrel of his rifle tearing over my ear. The impetus
of the push brought him right up to me, and as he
tried to jump back I caught him with a short hard
prod in the side. He dropped his gun, staggered
back and the last I saw of him he was clutching at
his shirt. No, I can’t sort things out at all for a while,
till somehow I tripped and went down. That’s the next
distinct picture—a chap with his gun clubbed jump-
ing towards me. But one of our fellows got him,
and the rest of it all was just a tense, silent push
and scramble all mixed together. I passed one fellow
right through the body, lost my rifle, remember hitting
someone in the face with my fist, then going down
again gripping a throat and ! All muddled
again; till I felt the excruciating agony of being
torn in halves; then a tremendous struggle to do
something or other. And that was the last. They
missed me in the first search. But they got me to
a dressing station that night and to the train four
days after. It was a bayonet took me from behind,
right on the knee joint. They say I’m lucky, because
wounded men seldom come back from the bayonet.
But it doesn’t seem like it here.

The Vest Pocket Kodak is as small as a diary—and tells the story better.
Every Soldier naturally wants to keep a lasting record of the brave part that he and his own Company are playing in the Great
War —and he can do it well and easily with the little Vest Pocket Kodak —the Soldier’s Kodak. It has every advantage that the
Soldier looks for.
It is Light,
and just turns the scale at 9oz.
It is Small,
thin, and flat. It is little bigger than a silver cigarette
case.
It is Strong,
being made of aluminium and steel.
It is Simple.
You can learn to use it in half an hour.
It is Convenient,
ALWAYS WITH YOU, NEVER IN THE WAY. It is an
ever-ready Kodak that needs no focussing.
Size of Picture.
Compresses a wide view into a little picture—2% in. long
and 1 5-Bin. wide. It is then easy to make enlargements
of any size.
Finishing: of Pictures.
THE VEST-POCKET KODAK takes eight pictures on one
cartridge of Kodak Film—and Kodak Film keeps fresh
for over a year.

Diamonds Reduced Enormously
Four years ago we took on a Sole Agency
calling for an enormous output of dia-
monds, and with a view to making the
turnover we offered them at merely a
broker’s commission on the Antwerp
cutters’ cost.
It barely paid us the first year; the
second year the sales were so great it did
better; and the third year better still;
and so we are continuing the experiment
further.
We only stock the best grades of dia-
monds, but our prices are THE LOWEST.
There is no duty on diamonds.

HOW TO GET RID OF YOUR
GREY HAIR
A Simple, Sure, Harmless Treatment
which can be used at home with
complete success. Age no obstacle.
COMPLETE INSTRUCTIONS
FREE
I AM A WOMAN who belongs to a prematurely
grey haired family. My father was grey before he
was 30, and two of my brothers as well as my sister
became grey early in life. Before the age of 25 I
developed grey hairs, which became quite embar-
rassing to me—socially, and also in business. I
LOST THREE 000 D POSITIONS for no other reason
than my fading hair. The groyness increased with
alarming rapidity, and at 28 I LOOKED LIKE A
WOMAN OF 45. One day I was seriously thinking
of buying one of the many Grey Hair Restorers
that are extensively advertised, when I casually
mentioned the subject to an acquaintance—a scien-
nb
nb
tific man, and, as I after-
wards learnt, a great
student of the Che-
mistry of the Hair.
He strongly ad-
vised me to have
nothing what-
ever to do with
these concoc-
tions. He poin-
ted out that
SUCH PREPAR-
ATIONS EVENT-
UALLY RUINED
THE HAIR and
in the meantime
rarely deceived
even the casual
observer. He sug-
gested that I try a
formula that he had
perfected after a con-
siderable time, which,
by a —certain * chemical
action on the pigmentary colouring cells restored
the hair to its normal colour. In replv to my en-
quiries, he assured me that the formula was not
only absolutely harmless, but would develop A
BTRONC AND BEAUTIFUL GROWTH OF HAIR, My
friend wrote out his prescription, which I had made
up, and after carefulfy following the instructions for
a few days, I was surprised and delighted to find my
hair becoming richer and darker in tone. The re-
colouring process continued until after some few
weeks my hair actually once again possessed the
natural shade of my girlish days. Since then I HAVE
SEEN INUNDATED WITH ENQUIRIES from friends
and also persons unknown to me, who came to hear
of this wonderful preparation. Having become con-
vinced that I have found A REMEDY OF EXTRA-
ORDINARY MERIT, and which is quite harmless, I
have resolved to offer it for sale, as I am certain
from my own experience that it will prove an ines-
timable boon to any man or woman who finds grey
hair to be the same serious handicap it was to me.
It is a Guaranteed Genuine Preparation, and I
OFFER A REWARD OF £lOO if it will not re-colour
Grey Hair to Original, Natural Shade.
If you are interested in this wonderful prepa-
ration I am willing to- send you COMPLETE IN-
STRUCTIONS FREE
under plain sealed
cover. Simply write
your name and full ad-

WRIGHT’S RHEUMATIC REMEDY,
299 Elizabeth Street, Melbourne^
“W.A.R.”: It was the day after the
murder of the Lusitania, when the school-
master made his little speech:—
Children, our kind, All-Highest Emperor has
ordered me to give you a holiday. The Fatherland
has won another glorious victory. No; not against
the perfidious English, who use poisonous gases to
kill our noble soldiers. No, not even against the
French or the Belgians. Wrong! Not against 'the
Russians, either. No, nor against the treacherous
Australians who are invading the territory of the
gentle Mahomet-fearing Turk. It is a naval victory
this time. Against the British fleet? No; our
glorious von Tirpitz has postponed that victory.
Our navy has won an overwhelming victory against
the Lusitania. No ; Lusitania is not another country
that has perfidiously joined the contemptible Eng-
lish. It is a big ship—one of the biggest ships in
the world. No; not a Dreadnought—a passenger-
ship, an unarmed passenger-ship. Did it attack our
glorious navy ? No ; it was carrying non-combatant
passengers. You remember the loss of the Titanic-
many of you contributed to the world-wide fund to
help the poor survivors, and you remember how sorry
you all were that such a fine ship should be sunk
and so many lives lost. Well, the Lusitania was as
big as the Titanic, and among its passengers in one
class were 40 babies. It is to celebrate our navy’s
glorious victory over these babies —most of whom
were drowned—that the All-Highest Emperor has
decieed this public holiday. Let this day be ever i
remembered by you. It is the greatest day, for the '
Fatheiland, that has dawned during this glorious
war. Now give three loud “Hochs” for the Emperor 1
and our brave navy, and run away and play.


BURNING TERRIBLE
-—
With Eczema on Hand and Arm.
Nearly Tore it Off With Pain.
Could Not Put Hand Near Water.
Used Cuticura Soap and Oint-
ment. Eczema Disappeared.
Ouruhia, Canterbury, N. 3. —“I wag
troubled with a small red spot of eczema
on my right hand. I used to rub and scratch
it and nearly tear it off with the pain. It
gradually grew bigger and bigger every day
until all my hand and part of my arm was
affected. The itching and burning was
terrible and I could not bear to put my hand
near water at all.
“I tried several remedies without any
benefit whatever and it was painful for
many weeks, until I resolved to try Cuti-

IF YOU SUFFER FROM
RHEUMATISM
YOU HAVEN'T TRIED DE WITT'S
KIDNEY AND BLADDER BILLS.
Why is it that thousands of people are
content to suffer the excruciating agonies of
rheumatism without even trying to rid them-
selves of their terrible suffering V
If every sufferer from rheumatism or any
other form of kidney trouble would just give
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Bills a trial
we should hear hardly anything of the ter-
rible agonies of these complaints—because
these wonderful little pills have proved over
and over again that they do not merely give
temporary relief, but do really effect per-
manent cures in almost every case.
“Why is it that
DE WITT’S KIDNEY AND BLADDER PILLS
are such a phenomenal success?” is a ques-
tion which many people ask. It is because
De Witt’s Bills are so finely compounded
that they pass, from the stomach straight
into the kidneys and from thence into the
bladder. That is why De Witt’s give such
amazingly quick relief dvery time, and why
a permanent cure follows in almost every
ease. Do not be put off with ordinary kid-
ney or backache pills, because you don’t
know and you have no proof that they have
touched the kidneys. When you take De
Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Bills you know
beyond all doubt that they have gone
straight to the affected parts. This is posi-
tively proved to you when you see the
blue-colored urine.
De Witt’s Kidney and Bladder Bills can
be obtained at any of the branches of Wash-
ington 11. Soul Pattinson & Co., Ltd., Syd-
ney ; Longmore’s The Melbourne Bharmacy,
Bourke Street. Melbourne, and all leading
chemists at 2/9 and 5/6 per lar<o> box. The
5/6 size is two and a half times as large as
the 2/9 size, and contains enough doses to
last you three weeks.
Try your nearest chemist, but if you have
any difficulty in obtaining De Witt’s Pills
send the price of the package required to
either of the firms mentioned above, and the
goods will be sent by return, post free.*
The H agic Art of Beauty Culture.
SOME HOME RECIPES.
By RITA MOYA.
A connexion that appears Hear, fresh and natural is as necessary to the sma t won an
as a modish gown. More attention should bo given to keeping the skin fat j^in M-
details of dress. The face, constantly exposed to wind, dust, fatigue and strain, ieqtt
regular and watchful care. One great cause of complexion troubles is thi „tr
greasy, inactive preparations which clog the pores and prevent the natuia " ~
of waste matter. My repeated advice is to avoid made-up cosmetics, am <» ■ •
ingredients. The various aids to-beauty which I recommend are simple, and if not a! ■
laPha'nd can be procured from any iirHKflilAfchemist. If he has not what yt n re .
ean easily obtain it for you from his wholesaler. Only let me a<lMse y . ‘
ing the original ingredients, and not to accept some made-up preparation inste. .
About Shampoos. To quote an eminent
London beauty specialist: “The slimy egg
cannot dissolve the scalp impurities, but only
adds to the trouble by completely choking the
pores with animal matter.” The substance
sticks and decomposes, thereby causing the
hair to assume a dead, “dull color.” I heart-
ily endorse every word. Avoid eggs (and
soap, too) on your hair. Try the delightful pre-
paration made by stirring a teaspoonful ot
stallax in a cup of hot water. It will bring
out new beaujty possibilities in your hair, will
clear and -prevent dandruff, and leave that
line, fluffy effect so much sought after. It
also removesi excess oil or greasiness.
Complexion Secrets of an Actress. —In a re-
cently issued, volume bearing the above title
the author says: “Continual use of grease
paints, rouge and the like, has ruined my
complexion. My skin was colorless, wrinkled,
coarse and punctured with large pores. In
America I heard of the virtues of mercolised
wax; my first experience with this marvellous
substance convinced me it was more valuable
than all the'.cosmetics combined. Now, when-
ever my complexion begins to go wrong. I get
a small quantity of mercolised wax at the
chemist's, spread on a thin layer of it before
retiring, washing it off in the morning. The
wax. after a f few such applications, seems
literally to absorb the worn-out cuticle, when
a brighter, healtliter, younger looking skin
appears.
Face Fuzz. —Many women know how to re-
move superfluous hair temporarily, but to
banish it for ever is quite another matter. As
regards depilatories. I must say that there are
very few good ones. They nearly all irritate
the skin, and even then only give temporary
relief. Powdered pheminol acts in a wonder-
ful manner, and the recommended treatment
is designed not only to immediately remove
the ugly hairs, but to also permanently des-
troy the roots.
Scanty Eyebrows and Fashes. —What a
wealth of expression can be given to an other-
wise plain face by fine arching eyebrows and
long curling lashes! Much care should be
exercised, however, in choosing a pomade lor
promoting the growth of either, ns it is 1 •'
tfically impossible to keep the lids tightlj closed
when' treating the lashes Mennalme has the
advantage ol’ being perfectly harmless, and at
the same time a healthy stimulant to the ■*
follicles. Its use tends to darken the new
growth, which presumably is what most
women desire.
Is Powder Necessary?—l say emphatically
No' There is a simple lotion which can be
easily and cheaply nifde at home, and it is
at the same time both effective and beneficial
to the complexion. Cleminite is a splendid
substitute for face powder, which is at the
bottom of many complexion troubles. Uet
about an ounce from the chemist’s and dis-
solve in four tablespoousful of water. lhe
result is a fine clear liquid, which instantly
gives the face, neck or arms that peach-like
bloom of perfect health. There is nothing to
equal it for greasy skins, and the result lasts
all day long under the most trying conditions.
'Pry it for the next dance.
Palling Hair. —How often one hears the
lament: “I have tried everything on the
market, and my hair comes out in handfuls.”
Not so surprising either ylien you come to
think it over. Hair tonics to he effective must
he fresh, and there is no earthly reason why
every woman should not make her own lotion
at home. The finest vegetable tonic I know
of is made hv mixing a packet of boranium
with \ - pint of hay rum and adding sufficient
water to fill a half-pint bottle. This lotion
rubbed briskly into the Scalp sets the hair
roots tingling with new life, and will, if per-
severed with, give you back your “crowning
glory.”
For Pale Paces.—Some folks are naturally
pale, and I see no harm whatever in adding a
little color to the cheeks if so desired. Rouge,
however, is always obvious, and to people ot
refinement some what vulgar. There is a sub-
stance, however, known as powdered colli-
andum. which gives a perfectly natural color,
and at the same time defies detection. Apply
a little with the finger tips. You will l>c
pleased with the result I feel sure. [I
AN/EMIA
(Poorness of Blood)
Pallor Depression Exhaustion
Be sure you take Iron ‘Jellcids’ when Angemic.
In Anaemia the whole body suffers, because the rich red blood
upon which the well-being of the whole body depends is lacking.
The system then becomes weakened and debilitated, the nerves
are starved, the heart is overworked. The result is Lack of Energy,
Depression, Paleness of Lips and Cheeks, Breathlessness and
Exhaustion after slight Exertion. To remove these symptoms the
blood must be enriched and strengthened—and the simplest, most
pleasant and economical way to do this is to take Iron ‘Jelloids.’
Iron Jelloids'
enrich the blood-renew vitality
The Revel. A. J. Waldron, Vicar of Brixton, says : “I have heard
“about your Iron ‘Jelloids’ Jroma Doctor, and have recently had occasion
“to take them. I am strongly of the opinion that if the public realised the
“fact that they have at hand at suclia small cost such a pleasant and efficient
“remedy for Anaemia, and such a splendid tonic for Nerve-strain, etc.,
“many a home would be happier and many a life made brighter.”
A fortnight’s trial ( Price 1/6 ) will convince you.

The Rev. W. Woolls Rutledge has been
elected principal of Wesley College, which
is to be established within S'dney Univer-
sity in commemoration of the centenary of
Methodism in Australia. Mr. Rutledge is
an old pressman, having been proprietor and
editor of a paper on the N. >■>. Wales North-
ern Rivers. But that was many years ago.
before the country press got respectable.
The Gazette, issued daily at Norfolk
Island, and produced with a typewriter at
the cable office, contains only about lMi
words, all cable news, and the cir-
culation has bounded up to three. One copy
is handed to the Mission Station, and tic-
rest of the issue is exhibited at two con-
spicuous spots on the local landscape.

From London: The Times has finished
its first year as a penny paper, and reviews
the results in a leading article. It claims
a circulation now “exceeding (hat ever
attained by any newspaper sold at the price"
—a statement likely to make certified audi-
tors bubble up in conflicting affidavits. The
Daily Telegraph and the Morning Post
are quite prepared to swear they are supreme
in the penny-circulation business, though
both admit that the half-penny Daily Mail
is easily on top of them all.
From Khaki, (ho little cable-news sheet
issued to the Oversea troops at the Front:
Sydney, February 17.—The transfer of the capital
from Melbourne to Sydney is going- on smoothly in
spite of the vast routine associated with the moving
of Government Staff and endless official documents.
In fact, the advent of the thousands of Government
clerks, secretaries, etc., aUracted for the moment
greater attention than the all-important subject of
war’.
If accidents like that happen to news on
the way from the rear to the Front, it
shouldn’t surprise us to hear that early
messages from the Front to the rear were
slightly mutilated, and that Britain, France
and Germany are really at loggerheads
with Portugal and Monaco.
THE EDITOR’S REGRETS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“A Lover of Sport.”—Sony we cannot publish
your letter ; it is libellous. —Queensland paper.
Although we’re quite respectable,
And virtuous, and old.
We love a lie, delectable,
If it’s discreetly told.
A libel that is hot with spite
Affords us infinite delight.
But, 0I1! the Law’s severity
Holds as an iron hand;
It curbs our wild temerity,
And stays' our dauntless hand.
.Much defamation we would dare,
But Damages make us forbear.
Our duty to society
Is ever in our mind ;
We stand for strict propriety—
For fear we should be fined.
We keep our sheet ,from libels free
Because it pays us best, 3011 see.
We ever strive to simulate
All arctic air of probity,
And virtues oft we fabricate
From nauseous necessity ;
The pen is greater than the sword—
But Costs are things we can't afford.

“Silas Snell" on the pitfalls of proof read-
ing :
She entered the editorial,apartment of the Beanhill
Chronicle with tight, lips, a strained expression, and
one hand hidden in her skirt. Appearances were sus-
picious; wherefore “Grafter” Xilbv, foreman of
comps, had endeavored to bar her progress in the
shop, and had been seized by the whiskers, and hurled
into a tub of lye. “You’re the editor!” said the
visitor in tones that would brook no denial. “Take
that,” she said. She produced an ordinary domestic
implement known as a potstick, and bounced it on
the top of Cameron’s head. Fortunately Cameron had
not his new boxer on at the time, otherwise the con-
sequences might have been serious; but a long,
purple wheal rose up on his bald occiput. “And
that!” said the woman, and crossed it with another
skelp. Cameron ducked under the table, and the
aggrieved female smote him as he passecP; needless to
say where. The editor came up on the other side
of the table, with a query in his right eye, and was
instantly stricken - down with the giant turnip
Kelly of Cattleflat had submitted for expert appro-
val that morning-. The perfect lady then called
Cameron a low name, and threw the leaden inkstand
at him. Cameron uttered a wail of anguish as the
inkstand crashed' into his bottle of square gin on
the corner cupboard. “Ma conscience, wha's the
matter, leddy—are ye mad?” piped Cameron. The
woman turned the office table over on the kneeling
editor-in-chief, and kicked him five solid punts in
the short ribs while he was si niggling to free him-
self. “Womman, womman, will ye no’ explain?”
pleaded Cameron as lie frog-hopped into a corner.
The lady followed up her advantage, and hit with
Webster's Dictionary. At this point “Grafter” in-
tervened, dripping with lye. He grappled the woman
from behind, and she backed him violently against
I lie keen'edge of a side table, nearly finishing a left
kidney already much the worse for war. Nilhy fell
olf, and the woman deliberately stood on his
whiskers as he ivrithefl on the floor. She knocked
out Cameron’, partner—Weevil the printer—-with
a crockery paper-weight, smashed two windows, and
turned on Cameron again with five volumes of
Chambers's Excyclop.-edia. When the whole printing
and composing staff charged her she was overcome
by. force of numbers, and held in a chair. After
five minutes given over to choice abuse of the
glorious profession of journalism, the woman veil-
tilated her grievance. She produced a small cutting
from the Beanhill Chronicle, which read: “The
defendant, Ethel King, a widow of 54, Evans-street,
Beanhiij,” etc-., etc. “Woel, wool, womman,” said
Cameron confusedly, “I dinna see onnything here ta
mak’ sik a deesturbance ahoot.” “Don’t you, 3-011
fish-fed savage of Argylef I’m Ethel King, and I’m
38 next June. Fifty-four is my street number!”
“Eh, mon, mon,” wailed Cameron after the woman
had gone, looking round upon the ruin wrot ght.
“Yon was* a sections delect t•/...punctuation.”

A S icy waters round me rolled
/-% My passing out was bitter cold ; _
My fingers clutched the wind-wlupt
spray,
And all existence swam away.
I saw the mighty hulk careen,
Her belching smoke-stacks, glinting gieen,
Their backward slant, their forward lunge,
Marking her last majestic plunge.
Like writhing hands, that gripped and
wound, ,
The swirling eddies swung me round,
And drew me in to sleep the sleep
Of those that venture through the deep.
Awhile my limbs were shot with throes.
White bubbles through green waters rose ;
For air I heard my organs roar
And strain, and stop, and strain no more.
As ever down I swayed and rolled
With staring eyes, set hard and cold.
I saw the ship, huge, dark and strange,
Drift slowly past me out of range.
And so my body wholly died.
And sank, and rocked from side to side ;
S-ttling, in measured progress, still
Through denser planes of waters chill.
I grieved that it should find no rest—-
That poor dead shell I once possessed;
Some grotto of the deep-sea’s floor
Wherein to creep, and drift no more.
That dead white flesh that made no sign,
That husk that was no longer mine—
I longed to see it sink and strand
Among the weed and clean white sand ;
Or watch the myriad sea-things hew
Its cells to forms of life anew.
So that it should be gone, and blend
With other growths, and have an end.
But to those depths it came at last
Where equal pressures held it fast,
And slowly cycling currents bore
My effigy for evermore.
A small, round sun. ’twixt dawn and night,
Sails over in a weird half-light;
But where these aimless currents Wind
There is no life of any kind.
Yet to these ghastly regions come
The drowned companions, drifting dumb;
Pale images that wander by
With fallen jaw and staring eye.
Poor shards of life, poor graveless dust!
We have no loves, nor any lust;
We have no part in any deed,
Nor any tale to tell, or heed.
The flotsam of the nether zone
That never shall be shoreward blown.
But in a measured dance shall swing
The mockery of its endless ring.
VICTORIA.
C. G. A. COLLES.
The Double-bed Dialogues.
THE WEDDING-NIGHT DIALOGUE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
GETTING married is an awkward
business, especially when one is a
beginner. And it is infinitely worse
when both parties are beginners. It has
always seemed to me a pity that nobody ban
thought of compiling a “Hand-book tor the
Honeymoon,” telling you what to do in tlie
vestry, offering you the choice of several
felicitous speeches that you could learn b.
heart for responding to the toast ot the
health of the bride, and laying down the
etiquette of the reserved compartment ot
the train. All these things are important—
a mistake in the etiquette of the wedding
day might mar two life-long happinesses, it
is my bashful hope that these truth u
records of my married life might form tlie
basis of such a “Honeymoon Handbook.
But for me, in my wedding-day experi-
ences, there was no handbook. I am a
diffident man. I find it difficult to chat. 1
can argue well enough —at least, 1 could
before I married Babette, and then I found
it was no use to argue. 1 can even con-
verse ; but I can’t chat. And on one s
wedding day there are awkward intervals
when it is necessary to chat. They take so
long marrying you nowadays that at times
you don’t quite know whether you aie
married or not. You would think that when
the parson has finished you off you are
married; but obviously you are not, else
why should you have to sign documents in
the vestry? You would think that when
you were in the motor, on your way to the
residence of the bride’s parents for the pur-
pose of the dreadfully long-drawn-mu
wedding breakfast, in that happy seclusion
of the motor, you would think you were man
and wife. But Babette. my just-made wife,
informed me that I wasn’t —yet. You would
think that in the reserved compartment ot
the train, with a long journey before you,
you were obviously married. But you
aren’t. At least, I wasn’t. You would think
that, on arrival at your hotel, after dinner,
you were a married couple, but Babette and
i weren’t. This state of horrible uncertainty
is very awkward. It is obvious that, the
conversation that a man can have with his
fiancee is not the conversation that is per-
mitted to a bride, and that the topics suit-
able to a bride have not the range of tlie
topics possible with a wife.
It was quite easy for me to talk to
Babette when we first met. And though I
found it difficult to propose, you may
remember that Babette herself helped me all
she could, by doing it herself. And, once
engaged, there was no difficulty in keeping
Babette entertained for hours, except the
habit my leg had of going to sleep just when
she was getting comfortable on my knee.
If there were occasional embarrassing inter-
vals of silence Babette and I amply filled
them by putting our lips to other and more
delectable uses. But as my wedding-day
inexorably approached just what I could
talk about to her in the intervals of that
dragging and spread-ont ceremony worried
me. Especially what I could talk about in
the interval between dinner and the hour for
retiring.
Neither of us had had any useful hints.
Bernard Shaw was no use. His “Getting
Married” is wrongly titled. His characters
are not getting married: they are talking
about it. They are going to get married,
not getting married. And in the many use-
ful books upon marriage, usually entitled
“The Young Husband” or "The Young
Wife,” the topic of suitable conversations
between the partially wedded is not even
mentioned. By the way. I found out art ei
our marriage permitted Babette and her
husband to mention these subjects, treated
so devoutly and so discreetly in these publi-
cations, that Babette had never read ihe
Young Wife,” which I knew by heart, while
she admitted that she liad carefully studied
“The Young Husband,” of which, up to that
moment, I had never heard. And though
we each politely offered to lend the otliei
our handbooks, neither of us thought it
worth while to look at them.
The convention of the fiction-writers is
that the bachelor’s wedding-eve is an hilarious
one. Mine wasn’t. I doubt if any
bachelor’s ever is. I did have the usual
bachelor’s supper with my friends. There
was plenty of hilarity, it is true, but it
wasn’t mine. They could afford to be
hilarious: they weren't going to be married.
They drank my wife’s health and my health ;
and this sudden solicitude about our health
worried me. Hang it all! I was only going
to get married. That supper seemed to me
like the last breakfast of the condemned
criminal. He is allowed to eat and drink
what he likes, happy in the conviction that,
provided the hangman is punctual, the pangs
of indigestion will never trouble him, sine
that he won’t wake up with the “morning
after” feeling. But I knew that Id have
both the indigestion and the “morning
after.” „ .
“It’ll be all the same, old chap, my best
olium said. “I’ll drop round and see Jou
in your new digs., and I’ll expect you to
look me up as usual —and tell me how it
feels to be married. I might want to do
the same thing myself, some day. you know.
(He dropped round once —and dropped
out. Babette said he wasn’t a bad sort of
man. but too bachelorish. She thought his
influence on me might be upsetting. And
though I dropped round to look linn up,
Babette, my wife, insisted on dropping with
me ; and the yarns he told would have proved
innocuous in a nursery. Even Babette com-
plained. I had told her some of his best-
made in my bachelor days.)
So mv bachelor friends drank the last
toast and solemnly in turn shook my hand.
I went home to my desolate boarding-house
and brooded in my bedroom. I had always
hated my boarding-house: but to-night I
loved it. I could do what I liked in that
safe haven. I could go to bed when I liked.
I could smoke when I liked; I hadn t t<
consider anybody about anything. Aobod\
interfered. But to-morrow my life would b<
dreadfully complicated. By Babette. 1
would have to ask her permission to smoke,
I would have to consider her wishes, even
about going to bed. No wonder that in mj
boarding-house bedroom I brooded. To
morrow night I wouldn’t even be allowed t<
brood. . .
No; I didn’t spend the time in burning
bundles of love-letters. I hadn’t any
bundles to burn, except Babette’s —and that
would be sacrilege. Love-letters are dan-
gerous explosives to leave about at any
time; and quite early in life I discovered
that the sooner they were destroyed the
safer one felt. A girl will put things in
her letters that she would never dream of
whispering —things that if read out in court
....Fortunately they aren’t read out in
court: they are passed up to tlm Judge and
then gingerly handed round to the jury.
So I went miserably to bed, but not to
sleep. I wondered if Babette was asleep;
and the picture of the delicious Babette in
the sort of nightie I imagined Babette would
wear was the last thing I wanted to think
about if I was going to get any sleep.. How-
ever. I managed to dismiss Babette in her
nightie from my mind; and I woke. at dawn
with the usual “morning after” feeling. And
the trouble hadn’t even begun. It was a
long, dreary morning, followed by a con-
demned criminal’s lunch with my best man.
He was horribly attentive. He compelled
me to eat, and advised me to keen my
strength up so persistently that it seemed to
me that he was my warder, anxious that
his prisoner should make a good appearance
on the scaffold.
“Confound you !” I growled, as he shep-
herded me into the taxi, “don’t guard me
Don’t watch me! I give you my word I
won’t try to escape. I know now it s no
use. I’ve got to go through with it now.
But I won’t wear handcuffs and I won’t
a handkerchief over my eyes.”
But mv best man merely smiled enconrasr-
irwlv. “That’s the way to take it.” he said.
“Keep it up. anyhow, till after the church.
The worst will be over by then.”
But the fool didn’t know that the worst
would be only beginning by then. And he
shepherded me all the way to the church and
up the awful aisle. If there is any torture
more horriblv lingering than the waiting

Inquisitors, while one thinks of Babette’s

and her habit of dropping things. I'd like to
know it —for use on the Church of England.
I waited there, my back to the foe. unable
even to look behind me. It seemed ages.
But at last there was a stir and a murmur
behind me. and T felt, through mv tingling
back, the tremendous arrival of Babette the
bride. Then I grew •conscious of something
in white at my side, something frosted and
iced over, something snowy and glacial and
refrigerated, utterly unlike my Babette.
Then I understood that the melodramas
were, after all. not melodramatic. “Married
to the Wrong Woman” was absolutely true
to life. I was in the process of being mar-
ried to the wrong woman. That iced, frozen
thing at my side —I was already feelin"
frost-bitten in my left foot —or perhaps my
new boot was too tight—was not the Babette
who had so modestly asked me to be her
husband. That was not the Babette whose
curves seemed made to fit into the embrace
of my right arm. That wasn’t the auda-
cious. human, melting, confiding Babette who
—well, it wasn’t that Babette.
Then a worse conviction came. It wasn’t

Babette at all. I had to look at this strange
woman. All I saw was an infinitely virginal,
remote, shy, spinsterish, unkissable thing,
glittering and frosted like a bridal cake. Ice,
not woman. A pale, pale face, without even
a glimpse of her eyes to reassure me that
she was alive. I shuddered. If she was like
lliis now, quite early in the afternoon, wliat
would she be like. . . .later? And how—this
was the awful thought—how could any man,
even though nominally he was her husband, ■
suggest to such glitter and frost the possi-
bility of-—well, say, going to bed?
But fast on this conviction came another,
wilh another shudder. Again I remembered
Ihe melodramas. \\ asn't it a habit in them
lor marriages to be interrupted at the last
moment i A hat if there were somebody, there,
in the unseen audience behind inv back, who
would interfere, who perhaps had a right to
interfere? Hurriedly I tried to remember
whether I had left everything in my bache-
lor life securely locked up? Ilad" I been
quite definite when I told Alice that "all
was over? - ’ Had Sara absolved me from
blame over her affair? Had I parted really
friends with Essie? Could I trust Maudi'e
—Handle who had always trusted me?
" hat was there to prevent Ella from being
nasty and Ella could be quite nasty when
she liked? Suppose Grace publicly disgraced
me. And why couldn’t I have been quite
frank with Jean when I told her I was
going away for a year, and hoped that she
would always treasure my memory? And
why oh, why?—did I kiss Stella so much
and so often when I told her that I was too
bal'd up to marry for years yet, and couldn’t
honorably keep her waiting any longer for
a rotter like me? And when I announced
to Irndence my engagement to Babette—
and not a moment too soon—why was 1
weak enough to put in my letter that passion-
ate postscript? I thought it would cheer
her up ; but suppose she were to thrust that
postscript beneath the parson's nose? If
1 rudence were as imprudent at my marriage
as she invariably was before it? And
why?
There were, you see, plenty of reasons for
my tears. And the marriage service had
wantonly provided for “scenes.” There is
an irrelevant remark in that service about
anybody having any just cause or impedi-
ment—and I had carelessly left such a lot
of these causes and impediments about —that
seemed to me simply inviting trouble. You
would expect a marriage service to have
more sense.
What made matters worse was that the
clergyman, instead of slurring over this part
ol the ceremony, declaimed his invitation for
the just causes and impediments to step this
way as if he really expected that somebody
would produce the just causes, possibly iii
prams. And after his invitation he dramati-
cally paused.
In that solemn hush I heard footsteps!
.hey were coming, quite distinctlv, up the
aisle. It occurred to me that if there were
a pram I wouldn’t hear it. since its wheels
would be rubber-tyred. I dared not look-
round. The footsteps came nearer and
nearer.
Ihe frosted bridal cake at my side shud-
dered closer to me, and I felt the grateful
warmth of her thawing fingers in mine.
Babette clutched me, almost clung to me.
The footsteps that still came nearer were
not the dainty tap-tapping of feminine heels.
They were the harsh footsteps of a man.
I was saved! But Babette? I understood
why she had so unexpectedly thawed. Some
man dared to say he was a just cause or
impediment to my marrying Babette! I’d
let him see. I’d marry Babette if there were
a dozen impediments armed with breaches-of-
promise writs or axes. For it was my warm
Babette, and hot an iceberg, that I was
marrying now. Grasping Babette’s hand. I
waited proudly for the impediment in the
big boots.
It never came. The steps stopped. Silence.
And tlic clergyman, disappointed, hurried
over the rest of the service.
“Bid you hear those awful footsteps?”
Babette gasped as soon as we reached the
vestry. Her first words as a wife ! “I got
such a fright. I thought: of—oh, all sorts
of men Who might think I had given them
cause. And do you know who it was? Just
Uncle .Tames. lie was late, just arrived in
that silence, and as lie’s deaf lie didn’t know
the noise he was making. So he tramped
solemnly up to the front seats.”
“I'll thank him,” I said gratefully, “for
thawing you. Do you know you. were an
iceberg up till then?”
“How could I help being an iceberg, when
you stood there like the North Pole, all the
time, and never even looked at me? But
Uncle James did give me a scare. It might
have been men are so stupid about things
like engagements, aren’t they? They never
admit that their own affairs are definitely
oft. even when a girl shows them the ring.
And I promised so many of them that—oh,
a £ii'l is very foolish in the things she says
to a man when he’s kissed her, isn’t she?
But, thank goodness, I’m married now.”
I thanked goodness, too. Babette was so
adorablv thawed now that I wondered if it
would be possible to put the windows of the
car up on our drive to the house.
“So it’s over!” I sighed, as we settled
down in the car and the driver started.
“Over!” Babette smiled. “Why, darling
husband, it’s just begun. First lap. There’s
all the wedding breakfast to go through,
and the speeches, and the changing into my
going-away dress, and the train-journey,
and”- Babette hastily broke off. blush-
ing. She wasn’t quite sure how much she
was married yet.
“Quite a lot to come yet,” I said cheer-
fully.
. “It’s all very exciting.” Babette sighed hap-
pily. “But it’s so long-drawn-out. I believe
Id have liked the old way, where a man
just collared his girl and then they were
married —all at once, as it were.”
“Anyhow,” I said. “I’m not going to wait.”
And I bent over to kiss Babette, my wife.
Ever tried to kiss a bride in her bridal
armor-plate? Don’t. I didn’t.
“You’ll crush me !” she cried.
“I mean to !”
“You mustn’t. Everybody would know.”
“But” I protested.
“Can’t you wait, then?” Babette looked
up at me with her first married look, quite
adorably shameless.
I decided to wait. But that fleeting
moment of intimacy was the only one vouch-
safed me throughout the afternoon of my
wedding day. Legally. Babette was my wife
—and everyone of her male friends of her
immediate past kissed her in public. And
Babette revelled in these public caresses.
Babette, my wife! Except at the wedding-
breakfast, where we had to sit handcuffed
and listen to old friends of the family blurt-
ing out tacts of Babette’s babyhood, and
other old friends making the sort of joke that
can only be made at a wedding without the
interference of the police, Babette and her
husband hardly saw each other. But I did
catch a glimpse of her just before our taxi
left.
. Of course, Babette was slow over changing
into her going-away dress. Twice I called
out to the closed door of her bedroom that
she must hurry. There was so much conver-
sation going on within that I was unheard.
At last I knocked and went in. Babette. the
beautiful, was being dressed, or undressed,
by half a dozen of her adoring girl-friends.
Babette’s underthings—l didn’t know their
names then—were so wonderful that her
friends were admiring them rather than help-
ing her. She stood in a state of undress
nearly as nude as when dressed for a ball.
But it wasn’t (lie same sort of nudity; the
area of skin showing was approximately the
same, but the bare patches were in different
localities. And nobody was in the least
shocked at my intrusion. You see, I was
her husband. It Avas the first time that I
had really felt that I was her husband.
e caught our train by the usual honey-
moon miracle. And. if my readers remember
“The Tragedy of Babette’s Nightie,” they
Avill knoAV that in the reserved carriage there
was one fertile topic of conversation. But I
could not help wondering Avhat I could talk
about after dinner.
Luckily, after the boarding-house dinner,
we found a secluded seat on the verandah. At
least, I did. I had glanced at my watch as
Ave left the table. It Avas only half past
seven. We had all the night before us. three
solid hours before bedtime. What Avas I
going to talk about in that interval? Why
hadn’t I decided on some place less access-
ible, some lonely spot that we would reach
only by 11 o’clock, and then have to go
straight to bed? Of course. I filled in a
large portion of the time by cuddling Babette.
But, curiously, I did not get the old remem-
bered pleasure out of kissing her.
“Isn’t it rather silly, darling.” Babette
shyly laughed, “now that Ave are married?”
It was true. She was my Avife now, all
mine. Stolen kisses are sweetest; and there
was no need mnv to steal them any more.
Always before I had the happy sense of
something in Babette’s heart hidden from me,
something of her affection forbidden. And
noAv the temptation of Babette had disap-
peared. We Avere man and wife. It sounded
rather dull.
. “So we’re married!” Babette happily
sighed. “And it doesn’t seem the least bit
different, does it?”
“It’s been a tiring day for you. dearest.”
I said. “I mustn’t keep you up late, you
knoAA' 1 .”
Oh, but ■ I’m not feeling tlie least bit
tired, ’ Babette quickly said. “I could sit on
your knee all'night.”
I had to "be brutal. “Not to-night. Bab-
ette. I m rather tired myself. A good, sound
sleep would put you right again.”
Babette considered this gravely, but she
made no move off my knee. So we discussed
the missing nightie for a while, and for
another period we sat, cheek to cheek, listen-
ing to the moan of the waves, and just think-
ing. At least, I was. Then my right knee
went to sleep, and then Babette nearly did.
£>lie oiidod one of lier kisses with a yawn.
We sat up. “Dearest,” I said with a
fatherly solicitude, “don't you think voin air#
too tired to” s ' a
To go for.a stroll on the beach? Noi in
the least. Come on.”
“I'm sorry, sweetheart, but I’m too wcarv
even for a stroll,” I answered bravely. “But
if you'd like to try the other knee”——
She did, and we sat and listened and
thought some more. Then Babette yawned
again.
“Babette!” I said sharply, “you’re half-
asleep. It's quite time all good little wives
were safely in bed. You need a sound, re-
freshing sleep.”
“Why, what time is it?”
I looked at my watch. A quarter past
eight. Two hours more! I sincerely wished
I felt the least bit sleepy. But I didn’t.
1 decided on a cigarette, first, since I was
married, asking my wife’s permission. But
my cigarette case was empty.
“I forgot to fill it,” I said. “But I’ve got
Plenty of cigarettes packed up.” And I
gently removed Babette from my knee.
“No; I’ll get them for you,” she said. “I
must start sometime being the dutiful wife.
Wait here.”
She flitted away before I could stop her.
After all. there were compensations in being
married. I waited. I kept on waiting. Surelv
Babette couldn’t have missed the cigarettes?
I packed them myself. Or had I forgotten
to pack them? Well. Babette would soon
be back. But she wasn’t. I began to get
a little anxious. She had been gone half an
hour. I made my way to my bedroom door.
Our bedroom door. It seemed strange for me
to knock at my own bedroom door.
A tiny, fluttered voice whispered : “Is that
you, husband?”
I reassured her.
“Come in, husband !”
The light was low. just a discreet glim-
mer. Babette was not searching in my suit-
case. She was lying on the bed. Was she
ill ? I hurried to her side. No; she wasn’t
lying on the -bed. She was in bed. Bight
on the far side of the double-bed.
"I felt a litle tired, darling.” she whis-
pered, “so I just tumbled into bed. I’m sorry
I didn’t bring you your cigarettes. They’re
on the dressing-table. Don’t smoke too many,
dearest, will you? And you don’t mind me
leaving you all on your lonesome, do you?
I’m feeling so sleepy. (lood-night, old boy!”
She turned over on her side, and snuggled
cosily down —to sleep.
I forget what we talked about the rest of
that night.

IT IS REALLY NECESSARY
for everybody to undergo a periodical cleansing of the bodily
system in order that all impurities may be eliminated and
sluggish organs assisted to perform their work in a satisfactory
manner. As a remedy with gently aperient and tonic properties,
Beecham’s Pills are unequalled for this purpose. There is
no remedy “just as good” and certainly nothing better
TO TAKE
than this old and well-tried medicine which is wholly free from,
any harmful drug, and prepared from the purest vegetable
ingredients of great curative value. As it exerts a most bene-
ficial influence upon the stomach, liver, kidneys and bowels.
Most of the disorders due to derangement of the digestive
system speedily disappear after a course of

PILLS.
