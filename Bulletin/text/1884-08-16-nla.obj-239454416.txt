Mr. A. G. Taylor as an Advocate for the
Cloture.
It is but a few weeks since Mr. A. G. Taylor,
after making a disgraceful exhibition of
himself, under the influence of liquor, in the
Legislative Assembly, tendered an apology
which was as grovelling in tone as his offence
had been degrading. He expressed his con-
sciousness, on recovering the use of what
reason he has, that his fault had been totally
inexcusable, and volunteered a promise, in
a fashion which was tantamount to pledging
his word of honour, that he would not again
go offend. Yet Mr. Taylor is once more
suspended from the exercise of his repre-
sentative functions. It is natural, under
the circumstances, to examine the nature of
the events which have brought him into
that position, and to inquire whether he has
been hardly dealt with, or whether he has
violated his pledge and forfeited his honour
-if any. We may prelude our inquiry by
repeating what we have before often stated,
that to the principles of the cloture we are
utterly opposed. We regard the rules which
invest a Speaker with the power to silence
any representative, as repugnant to the
spirit and essence of the Constitution, and
as fraught with extreme danger to popular
liberties. It has to be considered that every
great reform has at first been advocated by
a minority, alike among the people and
among their representatives in Parliament
It has generally happened that in Parlia
ment a great reform has at first been ad vo-
cated by one or two individuals, and scouted
with scorn, and with more or less passion
and bitterness, by majorities. And it has
been the rule that the smaller the minority,
the deeper has been the contempt showered
upon proposals for reforms or changes; and
the greater the disposition to disregard
the canons of toleration and the maxims of
fair play, which were really the bases of the
rights of almost absolute free speech which
belonged to members of the British Parlia-
mentbefore the House of Commons invented,
and other Legislatures adopted, the new rules
under which Mr. Taylor is to-day suffering
suspension from his legislative fuuclions.
* * *
A majority, supported by the apparently
almost unanimous feeling of the people in
general, and of the members of its own
body, is much more apt to silence by sheer
force or intimidation one or two members,
than it would bo to take the responsibility
of silencing a considerable minority which
had a corresponding following among the
public. But the one or two may be—and,
indeed, often have been—simply the ablest
and the most clear-sighted and devoted.
The ideas which they have originated or
conceived, and which they Leek to promul-
gate, have over and over again been proved
by the outcome to be true and just-of
genuine principle and actual necessity. To
silence the few would have been in many
historical instances, when single men or
small groups have stood forth and thrust
unwelcome protestations and demonstra-
tions down the throats of obstinate, dull, or
furious majorities, a fearful and irreparable
injury to society. Under the new rules it
would have been possible for the Court
majority to silence Hampden, to stifle on
occasion the voices of Fox and of Burke, to
have expelled the elder Pitt, and for the
squirearchy in the House of Commons to
have gagged and suspended William Cob-
den and John Brioht in the early days of
the anti-corn-law agitation. They are evil
rules, these cloture arrangements, and we
denounce as enemies of their country
such men as address themselves to con-
vince the unthinking that such powers
are desirable and necessary for the pro-
per conduct of public business. Their
guilt and responsibility is at least equal to
the guilt and responsibility of an officer of
Parliament, or any members of a majority,
who may employ the cloture oppressively*
The arrogance of these latter would surely
create a revulsion of feeling; and so long as
representation continued to be real, flagrant
abuse of the power of cloture would pro-
bably bring about its abolition and a return
to the ancient methods.
• * *
The best Liend and most active propa-
gandist of the principles of lh6 cloture in
New South Wales, we discover in Mr. A, G.
Taylor! Every man who so strains the
forms of Parliamentary procedure and tres-
passes upon its patience, assumes the re-
sponsibility of diffusing an impression that
means of controlling and repressing the per-
sistence of minorities or of individuals are
necessary for the proper and uninterrupted
transaction of public business. This respon-
sibility is one which may be justified and
sustained. Its justification is proportionate
to the genuineness of the conviction and the
seriousness of the purpose which actuate the
persistent, eccentric, or obstructive mem-
ber, The earnestness of a public man can
only be gauged by the character of the pro-
positions which he insists upon forcing upon
a reluctant House, and by the reasonable-
ness or logical construction of the argu-
ments by which he urges and demonstrates
his objects. It is quite clear that no man’s
depth and solidity of conviction can be ihea-
sured by the amount of mere clamour which
he creates, or by the length of the extracts
from Hansard or the “Eucyclopoedia,” which
he recites to the House, or by the number of
hours he stands in his place gibbering non-
sense. If such were admitted to be evi-
dences of earnest conviction—if clamour
and obstruction were tokens of patriotic re-
solution—the drunkest member of a Legis-
lature would, when any measure was being
stubbornly opposed, be entitled to claim ap-
plause as the most devoted. Again, if mere
physical endurance were to be recognised
as the test of what should and what should
not be enacted, a party of bullock-driyers—•
although illiterate and entirely unable to
comprehend the question to be decided—
would be entitled to prevail over a majority
composed entirely of philosophic statesmen.
Or, by employing the reductio ad. ahsurdum
method of demonstration, wo may put it,
that if physical force is the test of what is
right in legislating, there never yet have
been such clear and convincing demonstra-
tions as were given by the musqueteers
whom Cromwell introduced to settle the
business of the Long Parliament, and the
grenadiers with General Bonauarte
broke up the Council of the Five Hundred
on the 13tb Yendemaire.
* * »
Abuse of the power of cloture would, we
repeat, lead to reaction. Nay, we hold that
the sheer love for free institutions which is,
or ought to be, bred in the very bone of
Britons, would, in due time, bring
about abolition of the restrictive sys-
tern, simply because its dangerous nature
would be recognised when calmly recon-
sidered. But that is presuming that
opportunity for considering the thing in the
abstract were afforded. Mr. A. G. Taylor,
beyond all other members of the New South
Wales Legislature, deprives the people of
that opportunity. His whole course of con-
duct is such that, were it his deliberate pur-
pose to treacherously reconcile the people
to the cloture , he could not better i ddress
himself to attain that object. It will be
observed that when the Premier moved that
Mr. Taylor he suspended, the resolution
was unanimously agreed to, and that neither
then nor afterward did any member offer
to justify Mr. Taylor’s conduct, or to ques-
tion the propriety and necessity of his ex-
pulsion. Now, it is well known that among
the members of the House there are many
who regard the cloture rules with disfavour,
and would gladly bring about their abroga-
tion were a tit occasion to present itself*
But Mr. Taylor’s proceedings had effectu-
ally closed the mouths of such members. He
had furnished an example so apposite, and
so strikingly illustrative of the apparent
necessity for such powers being exerted by
the House, that a general argument against
the propriety and value of these rules would
have sounded ridiculous, while a particular
argument claiming that there had been
abuse or impropriety in the exercise of these
powers in Mr. Taylor’s case would have
been obviously preposterous. And the effect
on the country will be identical. There is
not a reasonable man who will think other-
wise than “serve him right,'’ however
deeply the individual may be convinced of
the dangerous character of the rules. Peo-
ple in general eonstiuct systems and build
up principles from detached instances, inci-
dents, observations, and experiences. Hence
many, heretofore disposed to generalize that
the cloture is dangerous and liable to be
turned against popular liberties, will now
qualify their repugnance by |the rejection,
what, in the absence of such powers, could
bo done with such men as A. G. Taylor?
and how, after all, could Legislative bodies
conduct their affairs in the face of the new
growth of Parliamentary rowdyism, if de-
prived of the power given by these rules ?
• • ■
A review of the debate will serve to show
whether Mr. Taylor was dealt with in a
fashion which justified his complaint of
having been subjected to “ bloody tyranny.'’
In the first place, however, we may remark
that as there was nothing suggestive of
bloodshed, the form of expression used by
Mr. Taylor was not a definition, but simply
a vulgarity. The question was that the de-
bate bo adjourned, and it was competent
for any member to adduce reasons w hy such
a course should or should not be pursued.
Had the Speaker, or the majority, interfered
to prevent any meniber from making a
reasonable demonstration of grounds for
adjournment, as it was possible for them to
do—therein lying, to our mind, the inherent
danger of the cloture rules—that would have
been tyranny. But, analysing Mr. Taylor’s
speech as reported by the daily papers we
perceive no trace of coherent reasoning in
his utterances. In lieu of argument, all that
is reported is a tissue of rhapsodical declama-
tion leavened with abusive epithet. He was
permitted wide latitude of language before
being first called to order for using the ex-
pression, “ this miserable, wretched House ”
Now, it is necessary that any representative
of the people should be at liberty to show
that the Chamber as a whole is “ wretched,”
or “miserable,” or “corrupt,” or in any
other way undeserving of the confidence of
the country. But it is intolerable and in-
conceivable that there should be mere slang-
whangings. Such charges should be con-
veyed and demonstrated in solid argumen-
tative fashion. Just as in ordinary life a

Mr. Taylor was next chid for wandering
from the question of adjournment to com-
ment upon those cloture rules which he has
now done so much to reconcile the public
to. The Speaker, shortly after, interposed
to require the withdrawal of the words
“brutal and sullen ” applied to the majority
of members of the House. After a lengthy
tirade, in which the absence of argument
was supplied by the copious employment <->f
puch epithets as “ wretched travesty and
blasphemous parody of a Government,” and
“ miserable shreds and patches of a Govern-
ment,” Mr. Taylor was again cheeked for
irrelevancy, and ultimately ordered to dis-
continue his remarks, by the Speaker, who
explained and read the rule which gave him
authority to so order. Mr. Taylor, never-
theless, persisted, was warned, still persisted;
and at length wasnaraed. He had not, during
all the time hisaddre-s was endured, uttered
a single sentence which was fraught with
sense, or which conveyed a valuable thought
to tho Hous3 or to the Country. He had
succeeded only in providing the advocates
of the cloture with an instance of unreason-
ing fluency, persisted in without regard to
any good purpose which ordinary minds can
recognise—an instance which will be hence-
forth quoted whenever the cloture is con-
demned, or an effort is made to abolish these
rules. For our own part, we are shaken,
indeed, incur antagonism to ihe rules,
extent that we perceive the additional diffi-
culty created by Mr. Taylor, of getting tne
public to recognise their inherent liability
to be put to evil uses. Mr. Taylor, we re-
peat, hos elaborately demonstrated to the
public the value of these rules under the
most favourable conditions. Shaken, truly,
we are yet unchanged. We believe the sys-
tem of cloture to oe intrinsically andradically
bad. Even in Mr. Taylor’s case, we think it
would have been better had he been allowed
rope enough. There is a proverb on that
head, and proverbs sometimes embody a
mass of wisdom derived from the experience
of generations. Give Mr. Taylor his full
fling, and we believe the public would in
due time appreciate, despite his superficial
smartness, the shallowness of his menta'
resources, and the insensibility to principle
which he disguises under a pretended rage
against injustice and chicanery.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The New Land Bill.
When Mr. George Ranken, than whom no man
in New South Wales is more competent, by know-
ledge of the subject, independence of character,
and disinterestedness, delivered his lecture on the
Land Bill on the 2nd instant, he held the attention
of his audience by a discourse which was equally
lucid and rational. Nevertheless, we find that the
ingenuousness of his mind induced the lecturer,
when he had got about two-thirds through, to
admit that “summed up, the incoherence of the
measure is so great that it is Impossible at this
stage to define what it will do and what it will not
do.” This is precisely thel view wo take of the
matter; and it is the incoherency of the Bill,
and the consequent difficulty of foreseeing what
may be the result ot its operation, which have
thus far compelled us to refrain from com-
ment upon the measure. We do not cape to
talk for talking s sake: and when we have no
cogent reasonings to offer, we prefer not to mock
our reader! with unmeaning essays, which lead to
nothing. Briefly, however, we may express our
apprehensions-not pretending, nevertheless, that
these are based upon sol'd facts fully investigated
and established in our own mind, but merely pre-
senting our doubts and fears as sentimental con-
ceptions, derived from speculative and anticipa-
tory theo Jzlngs. With this necessary preamble,
we may say downright that the Bill, as finally
framed in committee, does not appear to us to
have preserved the characteristics so boldly
limned for it by Mr. Parnell, when first
introducing it. We do not recognize in it
the Bill which originally won our hearty ap-
proval and ready applause. We are oppressed
with a conviction that this will turn out to be for
the country, as contrasted with the system of Sir
John Robertson, which it was supposed to ter-
minate, seven devils worse than the first. We fear
that, what with Land Courts with all their costly
machinery of agents and counsel; non-residential
selection, rendering the whole larrikin population
available for dummies; the preservation of the
power of mortgage, operating to counteract the
risk of such dummies, otherwise assured bad faith;
and other features, which we will not trouble
to recite-the prospects of securing bona fide
selection and settlement will bo smaller than
ever, while illicit alienation will progress at
accelerated speed. Mr. Parnell, we observe,
retorted to Mr. Sutton’s declaration that he saw
his way to “work” the Act, that, were be to do
so, he would speedily find himself in Darlinghurst
Gaol. The reply was trivial, and, to the people of
this colony, its lack of significance is obvious.
Had Sir John Robertson’s Act been severely
administereo, the gaols would have been overflow-
ing during the last twenty years, and wo are nr*
clear that Mr. Farnbll, the Land agent, might
not have been among their population. If one
law operates to demora ise a whole community,
other laws making penal the particular sort ot
demoralisation, i .variably lose their efficacy in a
sell-governed community. We do not yet de-
nounce the new Land Bid Wo shall have to see
iaor<e clearly first. But we misllke it.
A Dismal Hero.
t Respecting the law which revives Hogging as a
part of the penal process, we have frequently ex-
pressed an opinion. We regarded, and still regard,
the revival as a retrogression towards the brutal
past. That Hogging is efficacious in checking
certain forms of crime may not bo denied, in the
lace of the experience in London, where garotting
was absolutely stamped out by the passing of a
law making Hogging part of the punishment for
robbery with violence. But, even allowing this,
we holi that there is a reflex action on society,
and that communites accustomed to regard brutal
punishments with indifference become brutalised
themselves in an appreciable degree. It is a
humiliating fact that among civilised nations flog-
ging had been abolished by all but the two most
arbitrary and backward Governments—Austria
and Russia—till a few years ago, when England,
in a fit of popular “funk,” took the saddening
course of stepping back to join these two. The
circumstances which led to this colony introduc-
ing floggieg were somewhat similar to those which
hal the same effect in Great Britain. But when
all that can be urged against the practise
is said, not a shadow of justification is created
for the fashion in which an agitation has
been worked up respecting the man Ander-
sen. An infuriated attack has been made upon
t he officers of the law, instead of a solid assault
upon the law itself. The magistrates have been
accused of “ brutal injustice,” and strong sugges-
tions—oven that the constable who arrested and
prosecuted the man should he dismissed-have
been thrown out. The facts of the case have been,
apparently with design, misrepresented; and the
drunken, dirty scoundrel, Andersen, has been
elevated to the dignity of a hero and martyr. A
subscription has been inaugurated on his benalf>
and there has been talk that the community
should “compensate” him; while one journal in
announcing that a meeting was to be held to con-
sider his case, actually held out as a great attrac-
tion that the creature would, perhaps, be present
Now* what are the facts ? First, was tho sentence
of flogging legal ? 'ibis has been denied, and the
magistrates charged with brutal illegality. The
law is this: Any person “ who, in any publicplace
or in view thereof, exposes his person, or commits
any other indecent act,” is liable to be flogged.
Did Andersen so offend, and was his offence
flagrant? The actual evidence, as given in the
depositions, of which we have been at the
pains to procure a copy which lies before
us, is unanswerable as to the atrocity of
the offence committed by the beastly Ander-
sen. Wo cannot give the evidence, because it is
totally unfit jjor publication in any other paper
than the Evening News. But the grossuess ol tbe
exposure and conduct as testified is fearful. Next
comes the question as to whether it was committed
withjn view of a public place. The Sworn evidence
is that it was within 40 feet of the gate of the
Baden Baden Hotel, and within view of persons
then passing. A great deal has been made of the
circumstance that the arresting constable did not
summon as witnesses any cf the persons whom he
mentioned as having tacitly called his attention to
the outrage. It is not likely that anyone would
have thanked him for being dragged unnecessarily
into such a case. We consider that a flogging Jaw
is an abominable law, but that no abuse ot the law
as it stands has been made in Andersen s case. If
over human beast wanted Hogging, Andersen,
drunken and devoid of sense and decency, was
such a mau. But wc hold that society is not bene-
fited by flogging any man. By all means, let the
law be abrogated. Bur, for mercy’s sake, don t
let excitement swamp the public sense of decency
and reason, and cause a debased blackguard to be
foisted on to the sacred pedestal which pert tins to
heroes and martyrs.
Mr. O'Kelly, M.P., whose pot trait we gave
a few weeks back, has written to the Daily News
from Korosao. He claims to know more about
the Mahdi s movements than any white man out-
side the Mahdi's camp. Thu seems to signify that,
there are white men inside the Mahdi’s camp. Mr.
O’Kelly says that, in dealing with this Mahdi ques-
tion, it should never be forgotten that in the eyes
of millions of Mussulmans, Mohammed Ahmed is
the true Mahdi (Messiah ) So long as the struggle
seems to be between the Khedive and the Mahdi,
both claiming to act in defence of the religion of
Islam, the prudent among tho Moslems may look
on and leave Allah to decide. But once |et a
J Christian Power attack the Holy Mahdi, the man
sent by God to restore Islam to im pristine force
and glory, and all doubts and hesitation will dis-
appear, and every Moslem tribe io the Soudan and
la Central Africa will gird on their swords and
rush to the defence of God's prophet. In fact, the
process has partially begun in consequence ot the
defeat of Osman Digna by British troops As soon
as the news of Graham’s victory spread into Kor-
fodan, the tribes began to muster and prepare to
march against theiofldel; but as they were obliged
cross the Nile some hundreds ot miles south ut
Khartoum, where both branches ot the river are
fordable at certain periods of the year.it took a
long time before the first wave reached Beiber.
An Arab, la ely arrived from Berber, states that
Caliph Noor ed Dcen has arrived at Shendy with a
force which he estimated at 300 001) men to rein-
force Abdullahi, who was already in that region.
When cross-questioned as to the number of men
with Noor ed Deen he declared that they were
“thick as the leaves of the trees.” “1 do not
believe,” says Mr. O’Kelly, "that there ate any-
thing like 300,000 men with No r ed Dcen, but the
Arab's statement, if true, would indicate tho pre-
sence of a considerable force. Any lorce, there-
fore, that marches to the relief of Khartoum must
be prepared to fight the whol; power of the insur-
rection. Ho far as getting to Khartoum is con-
cerned, 30,000 men, by keeping to ihe river, may
be able to do it, but as soon as they are saleiy in
occupation of Khar oum it will become necessary
to send another army to relieve them, and the first
movement of retreat will bring on them the whole
fanaticil population of the Houdan. A war by
England against tbe Madhi would be viewed in
the light of a crusade against the Mahommedan
religion both by African and Asiatic Moslems,
ana it might well happen that before an English
army could reach Obeid-and, if English sol iieis
come here, to Oberd they will have to go-another
English army wopld have to be dispatched to save
India. ’
Blaine and Logan.
To-day we present to the readers of The Bulle-
tin portraits of the two men who, above all others,
are just now occupying the public mind of a
nation composed of sixty millions of people. We
refer, of course, to James G. Blaine and John A.
Logan, Republican candidates for President and
Vice-President respectively of the United States,
Both of these men have been identified with
American politics for more than a quarter of a
century, and tor fully that length of time their
names have been almost as familiar in their own
country as household words. Both are lawyers,
and each, while widely different from the other
in general characteristics, possesses a few traits
that are common to the other. Blaine, who hails
from the Htate ot Maine, and is always spoken of
as the Plumed Knight, is pre-eminently a politi-
cian; but he goes beyond this, and may justly lay
claim to statesmanship of no mean degree. He is
a vloient partisan, but tuis is only because he is a
patriot and believes that his party is right. His
fidelity to the country was shown in his splendid
opposition to the rebel War claims that were
brought in by Southern members .after the war,
the object being to secure indemnity to the rebels
for property destroyed during the progress of the
late Civil War. Advocated and championed by
such brilliant men as Ben. Hill, of Georgia, it re-
quired a bold and clear-minded man to lead the
opposition on in such a fight, and James G. Blaine
was the one to step to the front. Before each Re-
publican Convention for the past 12 years his name
has been brought as a candidate for the Presi-
dency. Col. Bob Ingersoll presented him to the
Cincinnati Convention of 1876, in one of the most
eloquent speeches he ever made, but failed to
secure the necessary majority, and the Convention
finally compromised on Rutherford B. Hayes, who
was ultimately elected, only to let the people
know what an ass Ohio soil could produce when it
laid itself right out for business. In the Chicago
Convention of 1880 Blaine tied with Grant for five
days of persistent balloting, and, as neither
could get the required majority, a compro-
mise had to be effeced, and James A.
Garfield was the “dark horse,” who won
the race. Grant's strongest workers ft this
time were Senator Couklmg, of Now York, and
Senator Logan, of Illinois. Their opposition to
Blaine was extremely hitter, and their failure to
foist Grant upon the country as a third-term Pre-
sident, nearly split the party In two; but they
finally swallowed their defeat with commendable
; race, and both took the stump in favour of the
nominee. The late Convention did a nice thing iu
nominating a representative from either wing of
their party to he the standard-bearers in the pass-
ing compaign. John A. Logan, like Blaine, is a
self-maue man. Blaine was a school-teacher, and
studied law while following that vocation. Logan
never taught school, and never knew enough of
text books to do so with any degree ot success;
but ho is a good jury lawyer, and can make
mo t forcible speeches when occasion demands.
He Is a mau of brains, who got his education in the
worlds ot business and politics, and he takes a
comprehensive view of every question that pre-
sents itself. His giammar is probably a little worse
than that of any otter public man in America, but
his knowledge of public affairs is encyclopediac,
and his logic irresistible. During the late Civil
War he commanded a Northern brigade, and was
known as “Black Jack, the Fire Eater.” Those
who know him best say that he will fight a rattle-
snake, and give the snake the first welt. John A.
Logan is a lineal descendant of Logan, the cele-
brated Indian chief, who boasted that he never
turned a white man hungry from his door. A
noble savage was this great-grandfather of the
present Senator. He was a tearless yet humane
warrior, and an orator of surpassing eloquence.
The arts of civilization commended themselves to
his superior intellect, and he is always referred to
in history as “the friend of the white man.” But
while John A. Logan inherits much of the nobility
of character that was so noticeable lu his ancestor,
together with an Indian cast of countenance, his
blood has been considerably mixed on the way
down, and he can hardly be anything more pro-
nounced than an Qctoro >n. He is proud of hia
Indian origin, and keeps hi* long black hair well-
dressed and shiny. By his swarthy skin, high
cheek bones, and piercing black eyes, you would
at onoe mark him for an Indian. And right here
we might just as well tell you that woman is occa-
sionally a mighty power in American politics. A
great deal of the political success of John a.
Logan is due to his accomplished wife and two
charming daughters. “ Mrs. Logan is a bigger
man than John,” is an expression that one may
hear at any time when politicians are talking shop.
Altuough the Logans are residents of Chicago,
Mrs. Logan and her daughters spend nine months
out ot the year at Washington. The Senator is
lavish in his hospitality, and when he wants
any measure passed he tells Mrs. Logan just who
is likely to be its strongest opponent. Straight-
way Mrs. Logan begins to “cultivate” that man.
She gives parties at which he is an honoured guest,
and permits herself and daughters to be seen at
the theatre or opera with him. As a rule, Logan’s
measures pass, but the most convincing speeches
made in their favour are the courteous attentions
paid to their opponents by Mrs. Logan and the
really engaging Misses Logan. What Josephine
was to Napoieou Bonaparte, Mrs. Logan is to her
husband; and without her the probabilities are
that Logan would long ago fiay-e found a Waterloo,
had he ever gained sufficient prominence to give
the lightest importance to such an event. The
election occurs neyt November, and the chances
gre greatly in favour of the Republican candidates
whose following have been invited by the forma-
tion of a “ brotherly love ” ticket. The Democrats
have nominated Grover Cleveland, of New York,
and Tom Hendricks, of Indiana, for the two
highest offices. They are both good men, Hen-
dricks has been defeated for the Vice-pr sidency
before, and ought to be sufficiently familiar with
the headwaters of Salt Creek to feel perfectly at
home after the voters of the country have sent
him up there next November.
Londoners have been growling greatly
about the loss of ‘'the season” owing to the
Queen’s love of mortuary reflection. At Ascot
tne Royal stand was closed “ by command;” and,
to the dismay of all the young ladles who had been
getting ready to "come out” this year, the Queen
decided that there should be no Drawing Hoom.
Colonial readers will please to understand that
in a certain rank of life in oreat Britain no young
lady is supposed to have “come out” until she has
been presented to the Sovereign; and when a girl
of 17 or 18 has been in training for a couple of years
expressly to be in prime condition and the pink of
fitness at a certain date, it comes hard on her to
have to throw herself out of training for a season
and go all through it again, with the risk of not
looking so “ blooming ” the second time. Hanlan
will bear us out in this.

The manager of a fashionable emporium,
observing that whenever an opera company came
his way. two or three expensive lace shawls had to
be sent home on approbation, and were returned
the morning after the performance with the inti-
mation that they didn’t suit, set to thinking, and
so, when Mrs. B. came in the day of an opera night,
and asked to have one of the most expensive
wraps sent home to look at, he just stepped out
and bought seats immediately behind those of Mrs.
B. and her husband. That evening, when he went
to the theatre a little bit late, there was Mrs. B.,
with the elegant laoe wrap, to be sent home in the
morning, over her shoulders. When she turned
he greeted her politely, and said he was delighted
the wrap had suited her She looked rather un-
happy during the performance, but the shawl was
not i-eturned.
In England a lady wants a divorce, chiefly,
it appears, because she found another woman’s
false teeth in her husband's pocket. A female
must, indeed, love a man dearly when she will lend
him her false teeth to crack nuts with. In a cele-
brated eydney divorce ease, not very long ago,
one of the leading allegations of cruelty made
against the poor husband was that he had put his
own wife's false te.-th in his pocket and stooped
her from going out. Of course, this contention
was a womanly and illogical one, as we have soon
many old and young ladies walking about without
any teeth. All these things go to show the down-
trodden and degraded position man is beginning
to occupy. It is hard to believe that in this “ so-
called nineteenth esntury” of Mr. O’Ryan, of
Pydney, a man can neither put into his pocket the
teeth of his own wife nor those of any other
woman without fear of Judge Windeyer.
The French Senate has passed M. Naquet’s
Divorce Bill. M. Naqueb is the well-known Free-
thinker who is, or was, Minister for Education,
and represents with energy and determination the
anti-clerical party in France. So long as France
had a sovereign—Bourbon King or Bonaparte 8m.
poror—these rulers found it necessary to stand
well with the Vatican. No conspiracy against the
equal rights of man ever existed that hadn't a
Church for one of the conspirators. Now the
Roman Church regards marriage as a sacrament,
and its influence has always been employed in
Franca to prevent the legislation of divorce. So
that, hitherto, legal separations, which afforded no
liberty to re-marry, were all that French people
could obtain. The Republic, however, doesn’t
trouble to consider the Pope or tho priests. Under
the o'd restriction, a frightful amount of immo-
rality was caused. Couples who could not agree
would not live together, and, of course, were
necessarily accessible to new accesses of love
for more sympathetic mates. The average num-
ber of separations for a long course of years
has been 3JOO annually. There are enough of
separated spouses in France to people a great city,
and there are few of them who have not liaisons
in the background. The children born of these
irregular unions are called adulterine, and neither
father nor mother can legally recognise them.
Nor can they inherit, unless by will, any portion
ot the paternal or maternal fortune, or, when
under age, force their parents to maintain! them,
which natural children, who are recognised, are
able to do. The divorce courts will have, for some
time after they are estab ished, plenty of work in
enabling separated couples to take new matrimo-
nial departures. Naquet wanted to give ill-mated
husbands and wives the power to separate by
mutual consent, and to spare them the necessity
of publicly Hinging mud in each others faces.
This liberty exists in Germany and Catholic Bel-
gium, where the revolutionary divorce law, in-
troduced into the latter country by the French,
has not been abrogated. A noteworthy feature of
the debates in the Senate, was that the orators on
both sides took un positions as defenders of
women s interest. While the speeches were being
delivered the gallery was filled with ladies, some
of whom were unable to conceal their transports
of joy on learning that the Bill had pissed, and
that tor every case in which a tribunal grants a
separation a divorce may be obtained.
We often launch our little shaft of fun at
dear woman about her dre?s; but, hang it! what
would the world be worth if she took any real
notice of us. and ceased paying attention to it?
Would her intellect do instead? No, sonny, it
wouldn’t, so don’t make any mistake about this
matter. Man comes in from the cold, hard world
where he toils; he visits some house in the even-
ing. and sees a daintily-appointed woman. She
looks so placid, so sweet, so perfect there in tno
glow of the parlour light, that she throws around
him a feeling of infinite rest. Is it her erudition,
her exact knowledge, or her great grasp of mind ?
No, he’s too tired to care about those things now.
It's her dress, and her dear self; it’s a charm of the
eye that catches him, and makes him want to see
that soft picture at his hearthstone every night,
and all his own. Her mind may be at Hongkong;
all he feels is a knot of ribbon, or a spray of
flowers nestling in the wonderful coils of her
silken hair; a floating sense of lace with some in-
tangible charm, a perfume that pervades the air
with every movement of tho trim and shapely
figure, who chats and smiles and sends him crazy,
Thon he starts courting. Yes, that's right; he’s
very earnest, and girls don’t come into the world
with any natural hatred ot the male sex that can-
not be got over by a very earnest man. So, some
time later, she sits there doing the honours. At
breakfast, there she sits like a beautiful statue
white and fair, in dainty morning dress, with
tho ineffable smile that a happy woman can wear;
and he feels at peace with the whole world, and
hates to eave that enchanted morning room.
Evening brings a yet more beauteous ichange
dressed in warm silk, with a flower In tho coiled
braids or at the white throat, bis love looks oven
sweeter than in her morning blush. And so they
drift on for a few months, until one day tho young
wife comes down with a dress hardly clean, and
her hair all fluffy. She is hurried, and thinks it
doesn’t matter. Well, that's the bloom off the
peach. He carries no picture into town with him
that day; and it’s because we want husbands to
carry a picture into town with thorn every day
that we write like this. Ladies, the
bloom that first made you beautiful. You can’t
hold him any other way; it’s no use trying. You
haven’t mind enough; and, i f you had, it wouldn t
hold him. You remember when ho was courting,
how you would never lot him see an untidy head,
a rent skirt, or a soiled stocking ? That was what
won him, and nothing less than the same care will
keep him. He wants to carry into town with him
overy morning a picture of a little soft bundle of
loveliness that will gladden his eves and make him
proud after the day is done. Ladies, the wife who
thinks it not worth while to keep neat, rates her-
self in her husband’s eyes lower than the barmaid.
“Have you depicted on your new suit?”

suit.”

Ldrd Shaftesbury, the besl-inteiltioued fel-
low alive, was presented with the freedom of the
City of London in June last. In >eburning- thanks,
he said he hoped those who fixed no his obituary
would have the goodness to record lie died, safe
in—nay, Brother StigginS, ho said not so, but—“a
citizen of London.” About the same date Lome
was admitted to the freedom of the Company of
Tin-plate Workers-a just tribute to his poetical

An “attempt to assassinate the Duke of
Cambridge ” was one of the latest canards of the
London newspapers. It appears that some poor
beggar, returning “ broke ” from the French
Derby, stood near to the Duke on a Channel
steamer, and “ looked miserable.” On the strength
of his unhappy aspect, the disconsolate backer was
immediately arrested. After this, passengers who
enjoy the felicity of travelling with Royal dukos
will take care to smile at ’em. That ought to be
easy enough, in all conscience.
In London, the other day, the Maori Kin"
entered a restaurant and enquired the price of a

“Too much I” curtly ejaculated the taciturn
monarch. “ Vour Majesty may have it for two
shillings,”grovellingly remarked the restaurateur,
as Tawhiao swung on his heel with the evident
intention of “eliddering.” Whereupon the mon-
arch sat him down and ate. Which doesn’t look as
if Tawhiao meant a big spree in London.

At Wellington South, N.Z , there was a
terrific electoral struggle between Mr. George

who has represented South Welliogton in Parli .’-

George’s age; as for Hutcheson, ho bids fair to
run Methusaloh close, and tve can t safely quote,
within a century at least, of his real antiquity
Anyhow, George gave the poor old centurian a
dreadful beating-no end of a majority considered
George the better fossil of the two to represent

Archbishop Benson, asked about the
necessity of public prayer for Khartoum Gordon,
is most arohiepiscopal in reply. He thiuks that
prayer should be pur, up for him; but, in order
that the offered petitions should " be wholly free

grounds,” he suggests that Gordon should be
wrestled for rubrically, as one in distress and
anxiety, with mention of his name before the
£rayer “for ad conditions of men,” or before the

Tawhiao, the Maori King, gave a dinner in
London, with the following on the ininn: “Organ-
grinder a 1’Italienne, Salvationists plain and
devilled, Stock Exchange bear on toast, 'Arry a

custody of the policemen whose duty it is to pro-
tect him from the “ resources of civilisation ’ as
represented In the unmannerly inquisitiveness of
a London crowd. The King of the Zulus used to
travel—like Bob Burdett Smith—“ in a cab. ’ The
mention of Tawhiao s dinner recalls the fare at
the Chinese restaurant at the Health Exhibition:
“Birds’ nest soup, puree of seising, sharks’ tins

“ James Rock eloped with my daughter on
Saturday, and, as she is under age, I hereby cau-
tion any minister or registrar against marrying
the same, or any .person harbouring her, as I will
certainly prosecute,” advertises a fathir. It will
bo seen from this that if James Rock has any de
sire to enter into the bonds of matrimony with
any minister or registrar, ho does it at his own
risk; and it he is frenzied enough to marry anyone
harbouring her, he cannot say that ho has not been
cautioned. It is plain, therefore, if James Rock
wishes to marry anybody, his choice will bo shock-
ingly limited. Perhaps, however, it was just as
well to caution ministers and registrars against
James’s blandishments. Should they, after inis
notice, be led astray by him and talk about it
afterwards, they will evidently split on a bad rock.
Tbe late Prince of Orange, though an ad-
miral in the Netherlands navy and a major-general
in the Netherlands army, was, not to put too flue
a point on it, “off his onion.” Dutch courtiers
used to say his peculiar disposition was the result
of his studious habits; but a regard for truth com-
pels us to say he was cracked. He and his elder
brother, “ Citron ” (who predeceased him a few
years back), were grandsons of the mad Paul of
Russia, which accounts for the turned milk In
their cocoa-nuts. “Citron” was a low, sen-
sual beast; the prince just dead was an ec-
centric ass, who turned his bed-room into an
aviary, where he kept parrots by the score. “ Cit-
ron’s ” fad was Polls of another sort. The little
girl, half-sister of the above twain, who is heiress
to the throne of the Netherlands, is WilParn Ill.’s
daughter by Emma of Walcleok (sister of Helena,

Of Henry Ward Beecher, Mark Twain saith,
Soking jokesat that holy and frisky man“ When
e bought his farm he found one egg in every
hen’s nest on the place. He said that here was
just the reason why so many farmers failed-they
scattered their forces too much—concentration
was the idea. So he gathered those eggo together,
and put them all under one experienced old hen.
That hen roosted over that contract night and day,
for eleven weeks, under the anxious personal
supervision of Mr. Beecher himstif, but she could
not‘phase’those eggs. Why? Because they were
those Infamous porcelain tnings, which are used
by ingenious and fraudulent farmers as nest eggs.
But perhaps Mr. Beecher’s most disastrous experi-
ence was the time he tried to raise an Immense
crop of dried apples. He planted $1300 worth, but
never a one of them sprouted. He never midei-
#tood what was the matter with those appaa.”
Give the devil his due. George Rankeu

and we re-publish his expressions because we also

Robertson. I And myself now, Mr. chairman, in i

prepared to curse Sir John Robertson’s nolicy,
and, lo! I am blessing him for his public vir-
tue. Well, then, with this distinguished excep-
tion, this instance of public virtue, which shines
like a diamond in a dust heap, every Minis-
ter tor Lands that we have had for the last
ten years has habitually, as soon as he left
olbce, set up his sign as a land agent, and has
turned ms administrative experience into coin by
showing his clients how to disembowel the public

Liberator Symes is mad with Canon Potter
(as, indeed, he has a perfect right to be), in that
the said Canon, after his debate with Ihe said
Symes, handol over the MS. from which he had
road to the Melbourne I) T. reporter—the said MS
containing a lot more than he had actually read
from the platform. Then the D.T., having clipped
down its report of Symes’ argument to the baldest
summary, published Potter’s in extensn, plus a
good deal more than he had brought forward in
the actual debate, with the result that Potter is
made to appear in its columns as having knocked
spots out of Symes. Wo think Symes does well to
be angry. It was mean of Potter. But, then,
Symes ought to know by this time that one can’t
touch pitch without being defiled, or play at bowls
without expecting rubbers. In having ever sup-
posed he would get fair play from either Canon or
D.T. he displayed an amazing verdancy. He’ll
probably know better next time.
Captain Barry will be getting himself dis-
J iked if he don’t look out. A Sunday or two a#o,
he raised his flag” in the Domain, and was
biffed out with exceeding expedition. Next
Sunday he again appeared on the scene—ap-
parently with the Intention of Interrupting the
eloquent utterances of Mr. Daniel Smith. “On
this occasion ”—as Maccabe used to say—Captain
Barry was more exceedingly “ biffed ” than ever:
and had to bo hidden from the fury of the mob in
the Art Gallery ; where, we trust, the illustrious
Captain wasn't shocked by —, but who ever knew
a captain that was susceptible ? We don’t want
Captain Barry to go to the Domain any more; be-
cause we feel that his life is precious to the State.
Without Captain Barry—we are quoting General
Joshua—would the sun revolve round the earth ?
We think not. However, in any case, we are
getting aweary of the gallant Captain’s voice; we
might add—were wo not too busy—that we re
tired of hio Barry-tone.
“ Dagonet ” (who is at heart a flunkey)
tells us that Wales, “although absent from Eng-
land and compelled by his recent sorrow to forego
tor a time his official duties, has kept himself well-
informed of all that has come before the Commis-
sion on the Housing of the Poor during his
absence.” What has really caused H.K.R. the
most sorrow is that Leopold’s death should have
occurred so awkwardly as to prevent it being
quite the thing for him to be present at Ascot.
Anyway, Wales’s crowd don't sorrow as those with-
out hope, since we read that on Ascot Cup day
“the lie complete and profound was given to
every previous idea either expressed or under-
stood about the English junior Court being one
scene of mourning.” It seems it wivs more difficult
than ever to get a place at Ascot this year, every
tenement In tue neighbourhood of the Heath hav-
ing been let for a fabulous sura. There'll certainly
have to be a Royal Commission appointed to report
upon thi. Housing of the Heathery-less ones dur-
ing Ascot week.
G. W. Moore, the founder and boss of the
Moore and Burgess Minstrels, has been getting
married again in New York, and it’s to be hoped
that the “ young thing ” he led to the altar will
keep the volatile “Pony”—as he’s familiarly known
—a little more in hand than did bis first missus.
Pony ” Moore, with a glass of drink in him, used
to be a terror to London cabmen, owing to his
strange fancy for knocking them down when they
raised any delicate question about the fare, while
even members of his company —bassos, tenors, or
corner-men—seldom parted trom the boas without
a bit of a brush up. “Pony,” too, is about the
only man in the world who has done much success-
ful “mashing” with a black face, but his achieve-
ments in that line are something wonderful. With
a great diamond star on his breast, and a myriad
of jewels glittering on his burn-corked hands.
Pony” wields the “bones” and ogles pretty
girls m the front seats wi( h equal skill, so that it
very frequently happens-but no matter, wo have
all loved at some time or another. Anyway, Moore
is a remarkable man.
Lord Cork, who serves our Most Gracious
Sovereign Lady in the useful capacity of Master !
pi the Buckhounds (the Queen’s awlully fond of
hunting, by the bye), has so far forgotten himself
as to give a dance at his town bouse before the
period of coilrt mourning for the Luke of Albany I
was quite expired, and it is hinted that both
Wales and his mother are annoyed at the breach
of etiquette, It was naughty when you come to
think over it. The Queen doesn’t supply a Cork'*
screw that ho may uncork his spirits at such un-
seemly times, and Cork's crude notions—[Excuse
him he 11 know better when he's older. — Ed. B.]—
of the eternal fitness of things may woi k incalcul-
able harm in society circles. \ r et, after all, the
moral laxily of the Master of Buckhounds was as
nothing compared with that of his co-peer, Lord
ot. Leonards. The latter nobleman was so utterly
lost to all sense of propriety as to Indulge his ama-
tory inclinations towards the serving-maid before
the expiration of that same sorrowful period of
court mourning. Now, there was disrespect lor
the Crown, if you like.
What Prince Leiningen has done to entitle
him to the command at the Nore is pretty well
known to the English people. But the list of his
recommendations would be incomplete without a
statement of a few of the things he has not done.
He has never served as senior officer or com-
manded a s'ation. squadron, or division; has
never been superintendent of a dockyard or steam
reserve; has never served in, much less com-
manded, an iron-clad or reserve ship; has never
been in a squadron of exercise or evolution: and,
in fact, has never held any c unmand or served in
any position of importance in the Navy—and yet
it is now proposed to perpetrate the monstrous
job of making him Commander-In-Chief at the
historic Nore I—
“ German saw on English oak,
On Englisn neck a German yoke;
German spoon in English dish,
England ruled as Germans wish,”
Wo forget the last two lines of the verse we have
altered us above, but it is to be found in Scott’s
“ Ivanhoe,” and is to the effect that England would
bo all the better for getting rid of a lot of pam-
pered aliens.
A queer story is told in recently published
memoirs about the late Emperor Napoleon and his
wooing of Eugenie when Mdlle. de Montijo. From
this account, It seems that Napoleon tried all he
knew to get Eugenie on cheaper terms than mar-
riage, and regularly persecuted her vfrlth his peeu-
■ liar attentions. Her resistance used to drive him
wild sometimes. On one occasion he was so en-
raged because she rebuffed his solicitations while
they were out riding alone in the forest at Com-
yiogne, toat ho put spurs to his horse and galloped
away. Consequently Mademoiselle Eugenie lost
her way, and didn't reach the palace till 9 o’clock
at night, all the guests being meanwhile fright-
fully embarrassed by her unaccountable disap-
pearance while • under the protection of the
Emperor. At last, one night Napoleon made his
appearance in Mademoiselle Eugenie’s bed-room
as she was about to undress. The spirited girl
snatched up her ridmg whip, and let Mis Majesty
have it over the head and ears. This soon brought
about an explanation, and in course of time came
the famous letter in which Napoleon expressed his
desire to have Mdlle. Eugenie for a wife—a letter
which the mother lost no time in making public
and which is now religiously preserved in the ar-
chives of the.faroily at Madrid.
Monsieur Boutibouse, the French savant,
served m Napoleon's army. At Wagram (1809) he
was m the heat of the fray. While reloading his
musket, he was shot down by a cannon-ball. I'is
impression was that the ball had passed through
his Je*r8 between the knees, completcJy severing
them; for he suddenly sank down, shortened, he
believed, to the extent of about a foot in measure-
ment i he trunk of the body fell backward on

giving him a good shake, said, with a loud laugh
Get up with you: there’s nothing the matter

astonishment and stood firmly on the legs which
he had thought lost. He had not a wound about
him. He had. indeed, been shot down by an im-

No more genial fellowerer sampled a wine,
scientifically handled a microscope, or was willing
do er fellow a good turn, than J. J. Bleas-
uaie, IjL.Ij., who has turned up his toes to the
daisies in Frisco, whither, some four years back
ho went from Australia. A Warwickshire man,
educated a.t Oscott and Lisbon, Father Bleasdale
was savant and man of the world rather than
cleric, lor 89000 years he managed the temporall-
wes of the diocese of Melbourne tor Archbishop
oooid, to whose saturnine vinegar the jolly doc-
tor s oil made an astonishing contrast. Naturally,
they quarrelled, and the kindly-hearted Christian
lett Victoria with a black mark against his name
in the Episcopal books. In California he made his
mark, as he had done in Australia, as an authority
on viticulture and as an analytical chemist. He
was secretary of the San Francisco Microscopical
Society, and subsequently secretary of the Viti-
cultural Society. The ’Frisco Newsletter says
tn t in his death the lady plaintilf in the Sharon
case has lost an expert who was carefully kept in
the background, but upon whom her lawyers
principally, and with good cause, relied. His skill
as a wirnoss, precision of thought, profound know-
ledge of his specialty and his venerable mien,
could not have failed to have been impressive.
The mistake of Bleasdale’s life was taking orders,
nut tor them, his life would probably have been a
success. E.I.P.
Talmage has remarked, ex cathedra, that
the writings of George Sand have cast a blight
i l P,9 a a| i Christendom. George commanded, and
still commands, larger congregations than ever
lalmage did or will, and her teachings are sweet,
rational, and tender—things deadly as blight in the
idea of a blatant pulpit-thumper like Talmage.
George had her faults, but among her virtues were
toleration, justice, discrimination, and a ten-
dency to examine things before condemning
them. She was, therefore, the antithesis of
priestcraft—to be bated accordingly, and preached
at by the Talmages. Despite their clamour, the
immense vibration of her voice —the “ large utter-
ance of the early gods”—upon the ear of humanity
will not soon die away. Whilst priestcraft toils to
k a g the masses, to restrict, to fetter them, she
cries The contempt of the masses, there is the
crime of the present! To execrate the people is
the real blasphemy.” In this she was more Christ-
hke than the Christian pulpiteer. “Heaven and
Hell, serving to cover the Illogical manifestations
or the Divinity’s apparent designs respecting
Man, had no hold upon her. Communion witn
the dreary, brutal God of the Talmages she con-
fessed to be impossible to her. But she trusted in
a Divine bense ” sanctifying life; and in her best
works she preached a social renovation to be at-
tained by conduct rather than creed. The further
this sort of blight spreads the better.

The Test of Actual Trial. —This is
what proves the merit of a preparation. The pro-
prietor of Green’s August Flower, knowing its
valuable properties, meets this test boldly by pre-
paring sample bottles of this remedy, which are

at a trilling expense. August Flower is a panacea
for Dyspepsia and all disorders of the Liver, in-
cluding Biliousness, Indigestion, Sick Headache,
Costiveness, &c., &c. Three doses will relieve any
of the above, and a faithful use will certainly cure.
No medicine in the world has ever given such
proof of its merits. Druggists recommend it witli
perfect confidence and physicians proscribe it
regularly. Price for- full-sized bottles 3s. 6d. SMd

Irving Bishop, the “mind-reader,” has

duct his own defence. If the precedent of the
Belt case, in which Judge and jury retired to see
t -e plaintiff at work as a sculptor, be followed,the
fortnomiug libel-sho v should bo one of the most
attractive en ertainments in London. By the way,
the Globe says “a bust of the late Sir Michael
Costa is to be executed by Mr. Belt, assisted by a
mask’’— taken afto; death. Envious rivals used
to say Belt did his busts assisted ,by a ghost, but
perhaps they meant the same thing—

After the curious and apparently thoroughly
genuine feat performed the other night by Stuart
Cumberland, who read the number of a ha )k-note
enc osed in an envelope in the presence of Mr.
Gladstone and a large gathering of tnc members
of the House of Common , people are not quite so
sure as they used to be that Bishop, when tested
in court by the terrible “ Labby," will not succeed
in giving a similar exhibition under unchallenge-
able conditions. By the way, Mr. Yat-s, of rhe
World, has to go to gaol for four months shortly,
over the Lady Lonsdale libel case, unless his ap-
peal. based, it Is said, on not very substantial tech-
nical points, should prove a success. He isn’t
highly exhlliarated a the prospect. “ I am getting
to no an old man, now," he says: “ ray habits are
unalterably formed, and any violent change in
l hem means a coffin for me.’ Let us hope that
Mr. Tates, with a view to avoiding the occurrence
of a “ violent change,” has all these months been
quietly preparing to (literally) take his “burgoo.”
After Irvi g Bishop has hunted for a pin on the

Like many more of her profession, Miss
Minnie Palmer doesn’t object to being advertised
—provided the thing is done cheaply and pleasantly.
In several English papers we have from time to
time noticed copies of love-letters addressed to
Miss Palmer—which amorous epistles have, it now
appears, been supplied to the journals by the lady’s
manager. The other day one of the papers in
question published a statement to the effect that
Miss Palmer, who has always alleged she wassingle,
and has actually gone to the length of publicly
stating that she was under a bond to her entre-
preneur not to marry for two years, is in reality
the wife of Mr. “ Montague Vernon.” A married
woman, then, is not so attractive on the English
stage os a single one. When this statement ap-
peared, Miss Palmer telegraphed to the newspaper
for the name of its correspondent, hysterically
thus:—“I ask for your correspondent's name.
Would you care to have your sister’s name played
with ? I have endeavoured to keep mine spotless,
and feel it the duty of every man who respects a
good girl to assist instead of trampling on me
Fou know I am single.” The editor neatly puts
Miss Palmer on toasu so:—“The week before last
Miss Palmer's manager was good enough to write
and say that Miss Palmer had been asked in mar-
riage by ‘one of the most wealthy and popular
pukes in England.’ Not one word of disapproba-
tion did Miss Palmer utter; but when she is sus-
pected of matrimony, it appears that her ‘spotless
name’ has been ‘ played with,’ and that Miss Palmer
has been trampled upon. Henceforth I shall look
upon Miss Palmer as a vestal virgin.”
“Your name is Spencer, I believe—Herbert
Spencer—a writer, and that sort of thing,” said
Henniker, drawing up a chair. “ Well, you see, me
and Bennett thought it would be a good thing for
me to stand for Parliament. I hold the sugar, and
you hold the brains, see ?” “Speaking of the
door,” returned the old philosopher, pointing that
way. “ it is easy to observe that it is open.” “ Ha,
ha,” said Henniker; “but, you see, philosophy
don’t gee with me. I was going to say—by the
bye, send out for something in the jug—I’m not
nice when I stand in the Conservative Interest—er,
1 was going to say that we might come to some
arrangement. How much a column, now, would
be a fair thing? The Times, say. Now, don’t be
afr.tid, I hold it. Me and Alfred don’t expect a
philosopher like you to go the ten bob a column
game. Speak up.” “Only a passing allusion
escaped me,” mused Herbert, wandering to the
door and looking out into space and passing his
hand thoughtfully over his brows. “ What are you
thinking about,” asked Henniker, pulling out his
watch; “business is business.” “Only wonder-
ing,” said Herbert, “ how passing strange it is
+ hat humanity is still at that stage of develop-
ment that when a door is open—means of exit, as
we say—and that door is pointed to by the fore-
finger of the right hand, humanity fails to grasp,
intuitively, the significance of the gesture.” “Just
so-very funny,” roared Henniker, “but you see
we don’t want ajestdr. Thisisa clean caseof high-
going slogging, understand me. Oh, don’t keep
walking around. What’s a fair thing now ? I’m a
Conservative, and you’re a Liberal. Very well.
1 suppose I’m entitled to my opinions ?” “ On the
other hand,”- urged Mr. Spencer, “I have yet to
hear of a popular agitation having for its object
tne deprivation of the monopoly you enjoy. At
the same time, however, you must admit that the
door is open.” “ Really—yes upon my word—
1 wish you would stick to business,” said Henni-
ber, counting out two sovereigns on the table ;
1 m not the man to go in against monopolies nor
for monopolies; and, as for your door being open,
why what else is your door fer? Shut it, if you
feel cold ? About this election. I want your
support. Are you on ?” “ Without further refer-
ence to the conspicuous fact that the door is open,
and that the inhalation of ozone—” “ Oh’s which ?”
interrupted Henniker; “ Oh, no. None of the O’s
forme. No dynamite: none of that for me. I go
straight on the loyal ticket.” “1 was about to
remark,” continued Mr. Spencer, “that the modern
r.me for sociological distinction characteristic of
the Australian plutocrat indicates a tendency
regarding which ” “ Oh, that’s all right. That
sort of gag won’t wash in this election. Come
down to figures. I want to get into the House,
and you can give me a lift. What shall we say ? ”
"The fact of the door being open not having
strict relevancy to the issue,” continued the host,
may or may not have many implications
collateral, U ot to say germane to the issue.”
No,” roared Henniker; “ let’s leave out the
Germans, too. Will you write for me? I am an
Australian, and I hold more Coin than you do. If
it comes to that, perhaps I have brains —“ It is
my turn, Mr. Henniker, to interrupt you,” replied
Mr. Spencer; “the question of whether you have
brains or not is of too abstruse a nature, and would
lead to a long discussion. Hut the door, as we may
say, being: open—er .” "I’ve said a hundred
times,” roared Henniker, “that I don’t feel the

more abstruse than the previous one. The door,
however —” “Ob, damn the door!’ roared
Henniker. seizins; his umbrella and making 1 a rush
for it—“if you don’t lick every pressman I ever
come across, may I be — ” The rest was lost to
the world, and Mr. Spencer watching the cab
round the corner, sat down and dratted a new
chapter for his “ Principles of Sociology,” under
the bead of the “ Bias of Bucoiic Buffoonery as
related to the development of Beastly Bad Brag.”
“I shall not soon forget the first time 1
met Miss Anderson,” writes "Granville.’ 1 “She
was playing an engagement in Chicago, and had a
suite of rooms at the Palmer House. Like Adelina
Patti, she is averse to being interviewed. After
sending several of mv staff, all of whom ahe re-
fused to see, I determined to try my skill or luck
in attempting to interview the obstinate little
lady. Having been a boarder at the Palmer House
for more than a year, I know every room in the
house. I determined, therefore, to depart from
the usual rule, and, ignoring the hell boys, to take
my card to her sitting room myself. Upon reach-
ing her door, I rapped gently and the door was
opened by Miss Anderson’s maid. I said, ‘ 1 wane
to see Miss Anderson,’ and then handed the maid
my card. The young woman closed the door for a
moment, and then returned to say, ' You can’t see
Miss Anderson. She’s in bed with neuralgia.’
‘Just my confounded luck!’I exclaimed, ’some-
body is always ahead of me.’ A smothered little
scream, followed by a rippling little laugh, came
boating through the half-open door, and then
1 heard Miss Anderson say to her maid, ‘Tell
the gentleman to come in, Flora. 1 want to
see him.’ I stepped inside, and found the actress
seated at a table writing. She looked up with
a mischievous expression of countenance, and
said: ‘Are you going to put that in the paper?’
‘That’s just what I’m going to do,’ I replied.
‘Please don’t. You’ll have the whole country
laughing at me.’ ‘ Don’t you think you deserve a
little punishment for being so discourteous to a
newspaper man as to send him away without see-
ing him?’ I enquired. ‘Oh, well, you know, I
have always objected to being interviewed. I
don’t know what to say, and am liable to make
enemies. I shall give a reception when I am
through with my engagement here, and shall be
glad to see you in the parlours then; but please
don’t joke me in your paper.’ I didn’t make her
any promises. I wanted to attend that reception,
but could not afford to be bribed by the fair'
tragedienne into neglecting the interests of the
paper on which I was employed. So I went back
to i he office and wrote up an account of the inter-
view, which, upon being published, was copied by
almost every paper of note in the States.”

can. There does not exist a case of chronic salt
rheum or eczema, tetter, ringworm, pemphigus,
psoriasis, leprosy, lichen, prurigo, scald-head, dan-
druff, or itching or scaly eruptions or scrofulous
humors of the skin, scalp, and blood, that Cutl-
cura Resolvent, the new blood purifier, internally,
and Cuticura and Cutlcura Soap, the great skin
cures, externally, may not speedily, permanently,
and economically cure when all other remedies
and methods of cure have utterly failed. We have
the most positive proof of their wonderful cura-
tive power, in evidence of which we publish the
following remarkable testimonials, every one of
which has been solemnly sworn to before the
British Consul at Boston
The first great home case was that of Hon-
William Taylor, ex-State senator, office 8 Fember-
ton-square, Boston. Cured of scrofulous sores on
the bead, lace, and body of over twelve years*
duration, which had resisted every physician and
method of treatment up to the time of using Cutl-
cura reme lies. Then followed diaries Houghton,
Esq., lawyer, 38 State-street, Boston, who was
cured of salt rheum, which for ten years had
covered the entire person, and was treated in vain
by the most noted skin doctox-s in that city. Ex-
Alderman Tucker, of Boston, came next with
eczema of many years’ standing. The majority of
the noted physicians of the city experimented,
dosed, and drugged him without avail. And then
a host of minor ailments and diseases were suc-
cessfully treated in New England. Soon the case
of H. E. Carpenter, Henderson, N.Y., astonished
the world. We give his exact words:—
“ I have be»n afflicted for twenty years with an
obstinate skin disease, called by some M.D.’s
psoriasis, and others, leprosp, commencing on ray
scalp, and, in spite of all I could do, with the help
of the most skilful doctors, it slowly but surely
extended, until a year ago this winter it covered
my entire person in form of dry scales. For the
last three years I have been unable to do any
labor, and suffering intensely all the time. Every
morning there could be nearly a dustpanful
of scales taken from the sheet on my bed,
some of them half as large as the envelope
containing this letter. In the latter part of
winter commenced cracking open. I tried
everything, almost, that could be thought of,
without any relief. The 13th of June 1 started
West, in hopes I could reach the Hot Springs. I
reached Detroit, and was so low I thought ; should
have to go to the hospital, but finally got as far as
Lancing, Mich., where I had a sister living. One
Dr. treated me about two weeks, but did me
no good. All thought I had but a short time to
live. I earnestly prayed to die. Cracked through
the skin all over my back, across my ribs, arms,
hands, limbs, feet badly swollen, toe-nails came off,
finger-nails dead and hard as bone, hair dead, dry,
and lifeless as old straw. 0 my God! how I did
suffer.
“ My sister, Mrs. E. H. Davis, had a small part of
a box of Cutcura in the house. She wouldn’t give
up; said, ‘We will try Cuticura.’ Some was ap-
plied on one hand and arm. Eureka! there was
relief ; stopped the terrible burning sensation
from the word go. They immediately got the
Kesolvent, Cuticura, and Soap. I commenced by
taking one tablespoonful of Resolvent three times
a day, after meals; had a bath once a day, water
about blood heat; used Cutlcura Soap freely;
applied Cuticura morning and evening. Result,
returned to my home in just six weeks from the
time I left, and my skin as smooth as this sheet of
paper. _

* Henderson, Jefferson County, N.V.
Sworn to before me this nineteenth day of Janu-
ary, 1880.
A. M. LEFFINGWELL,
Justice ol the Peace "
Another wonderful case Is reported bv P. H.
Brown, Esq., Barnwell, S.C., and endorsed by Dr.
H. Baer. Charlestown, S.C. He writes: —
“I will now state that I made a miraculous cure
of one of the worst cases of skin diseases known.
The patient is a man forty years old; had suffered
fifteen years. His eyes, scalp, and nearly his whole
body presented a frightful appearance. Had had
the attention of twelve different physicians, who
prescribed the best remedies known to the pro-
fession, such as iodide potassium, arsenic, corro-
sive sublimate, sarsaparilla, etc. Had paid §500 for
medical'treatment with but little relief. I pre-
vailed upon him to use the Cuticura Kesolvent in-
ternally, and the Cuticura and Cuticura Soap ex-
ternally. He did so, and was completely cured.
The skin on his head, face, and many other parts
of his body, which presented a most loathsome ap-
pearance, is now as soft and smooth as an infant s,
with no scar or trace of the disease left Dehind.
He has now been cured twelve months.”
P. H. Drake, Esq., agent for Harper and Brothers,
gives an astonishing account of his case (eczema
rodent), which had been Deated by a consultation
of physicians without benefit, and which speedily
yielded to the Cuticura remedies. Will McDonald,
3542 Dearborn-street, Chicago, gratefully acknow-
ledges a cure of salt rheum on head, neck, face,
arms, and legs for seventeen years; not able to
walk except on hands and knees for one year; not
able to help himself for eight years; tried hun-
dreds of remedies; doctors pronounced his case
hopeless; permanently cured by Cuticura reme-
dies. Thomas Delaney, Memphis, Tenn., afflicted
with psoriasis for nineteen years: completely cured
by Cuticura remedies. George W. Brown, 48 Mar-
shall-street, Providence, R.I., cured of a ringworm
humor got at the barber’s, which spread all over
the ears, neck, and face, and for six years resisted
all kinds of treatment; cured by Cuticura reme-
dies. Mrs. S. E. Whipple, Decatur, Mich., writes
that her face, head, and some parts of her body
were almost raw; head covered with scabs and
sores; suffered fearfully, and tried everything.
Permanently cured by Cuticura remedies.
The following complete and permanent cures
are condensed from the originals for want of
space, but the full statements can be had by re-
turn mail:—H. A. Raymond, Esq., Jackson, Mich.,
scald head of nine years’ duration; Prank A. Bean,
Steam Fire Engine 6, Boston, cured of alopecia, or
falling of the hair; Prank Ashley, 26 Portland-
street, Boston, ulcers in throat and stomach;
Henry Landecker, Dover. N.H., varicose ulcer;
Thomas Lee. 2276 Prankford Avenue. Philadel-
phia, dandruff one-quarter inch thick, twenty
years; Joseph A. Palmer, Hudson, Mass., running
sores on leg, seven years; Charles H. Tripp,
Alfred, Me., fever sore for years; Fred. Rohrer,
Pueblo, Col. (baby); Manuel Manintz, 71 Burgundy-
street, New Orleans, salt rheum; J. S. Weeks, St.
Albans, Vt. (baby); Charle Eagre Hinkle, Jersey
City Heights, N.J., eczema on his son, twelve
years; S. G. Buxton, Milan, Mich., itching skin
humor, with copper-coloured skin; Andrew Dona-
hoe, East Somerville, Mass., erysipelas, six years;
Mrs. Benjamin Smith, Way’s Mills, P.Q., salt rheum
and psoriasis of many years’standing.
Of su' h a record the inventors of the Cuticura
remedies may bo justly proud. They are a grand
medical triumph; a triumph that will be grate-
fully remembered by thousands long after the
originators had passed away. To relieve and per-
manently cilre diseases of the skin and scalp which
have been the torture of a lifetime, to replace the
repulsive evidences of disease with the glow of
health, and thus render beautiful the face of man
or woman, is to deserve the gratitude of mankind.
That Cuticura and Cuticura r'oap externally, and
the Cuticura Resolvent internally, will cur®
speedily and permanently the worst forms of skin
and scalp diseases, with loss of hair, wo believe we
have fully demonstrated. Grand curative bless-
ings are thus substituted for death-dealing poisons.
Mercury, arsenic, ?.ino and lead, and a thousand
and one other revolting, poisonous and senseless
things, must now sink into obscurity before the
wonderful healing powers of the Cuucura reme-
dies, which may bo had of any chemist at less than
the cost of a single visit of a physician.—Zion’s
Herald.
At the reception given by the good folks
of Hamilton (Vic) to the newly-inducted Arch-
deacon Cooper, we arc told bytholocalbi’BCTATOK
that an enthusiastic A. glican countable spoke
kalizoloally Down our way. Constables speak
stoically, their word being “move on,” or some-
thing simple of that kind; but on welcomingaa
archdeacon after dinner, of course considerable
latitude is allowed. “ Kalizoically ” neatly ex-
presses the idea of considerable latitude having
been taken.
“Wo are not,” remarks the Hum, “especi-
ally anxious to advertise ourselves, but yet we
say the Tribune Cup," etc. But yet—wo do not
like “but yet”: it does aday the good precedence;
lia upon "but yet”—‘‘but yet” is as a gaoler to
bring forth some measly culprit. Not especially
anxious to advertise itself, the Rum? Phewl
Why, in advertising itself (which to do righteously
is no sin), it adulterates with such a lot of rancid
fat that tlum-butter is a term in the provinces for
journalistic oleomargarine.
A “ poddy ” immigrant of genteel ante-
cedents thus advertised in Guannv:—“A Young
Gentleman, aged 33, without friends, recently from
England, wishes to bo Adopted by an old lady or
gentleman. This is genuine. Address L.L.” It
“ L.L.” had only had the gumption to have added
“second cousin to a Marq ii?," “near connection
of a Viscount," or “ grandson of a Baron” (not
barring even St. Leonards), It is by no means im-
probable that ho might have netted the fool he is
in search of. That “without friends” cooks his
chances.
Oneof the London papers accuses the Arch-
bishop of Canterbury of being, owing to his callous-
ness, a Revolutionary Agent, it addresses him thus:
—"Oue of your first actions as Primate showed
that you had some sense of the pressing nature of
these questions. Foil visited the poorer parts of
London, and, startled as you were at the conditions
of life and work which yon saw there, gave It as
the opinion of the head of the Church that the lot
of the matchbox-raakcrs “ might be alleviated by
spiritual consolation.” Many men have pondered
over that pregnant observation, and no more
terrible attack has been on the creed your
Grace proles-es than is contained in your travesty
of the words of the carpenter of Nazareth, “Come
unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden,
and 1 will give you—spiritual consolation.”
It is now more than 54 years since “ A
Peasant’s Voice to Landholders,” &c., was pub-
lished by a piasant-proprie or, who wrote:—
“There yet remains in our village a number of
small proprietors and occupiers—fifty perhaps,
each ■ f whom is able, though with difficulty, to
pay his rent, cmplov his family, keep its indivi-
duals well fed and clnhed, pay his tradesmen, pur-
chase his weekly shop things; in short, can make
himself and fatnil comparatively comfortable
and add to the comfort of others. Now, let u»
suppose that one of the fifty, by some moans, gets
to be the proprietor cr occupier of the whole, the
consequences would be—he would have no sym-
pathy for forty-nine; he probably would build
himself a stately mansion, keep his gig, purchase
more of the luxuries of life. But the forty-nine—
aye, the fallen forty-nine—what would become of
them ? Why, they would, in part, be- dependent on
the parish.” This is the system that has been
going on. until the land belonging to whole vil-
lages has got into the hands of two or three indi-
viduals, a portion of which land, either great or
small, was in the possession of almost every in-
habiiant. The enclosures have accelerated these
devastating transfers. The subject is one that,
shouN receive the earnest attention of social
reformers.
The shocking tjeath of Prince Leopold has
evidently been secretly attributed by the Queen
to its true cause—ovor-cxcitement of a gambling
bout at Monaco. At any rate. Her Majesty has
just protested strongly against the gaming tables
tbi-re being continued. Of course, the true reason
is not hinted at. The courtly way of putting it is
that “ Her Majcstr, while staying near the spot,
war. told so many stories of the terrible suicides
which occurred through ruination at the tables,
that she thought it prudent to interfere. This is
very creditable to the Queen,” &c. The worst of
it is that the Monaco people have retorted by in-
viting Her M«j sty to mind her own business—in
short, to begin her moral reforms at home by
using her iulluence to abolish gambling at horse
races. Reference is Imade to the fact that the
officers of her own Horse Guards quartered at
Windsor lost something like £60,000 during Ascot
week, while the bookmakers won over £350,000
from the public, and in the London clubs hundreds
of thousands sterling are staked on every “great
event.” It mads, oddly, anyhow, to find in a single
issue of a London paper three detached Items
thus:—“The Queen has protested against the
gaining tables at Monaco being continued,” “The
Prince of Wales will visit Newmarket during the
July meeting. A select party are invited to meet
His Royal Highness.” “ It is understood that
there will be a Royal party at Goodwood this
year.”

ORIENTAL GOLD
Is the latest discovery of Science and the grandest
achievement of the alchemist's art. It looks like
gold, it is as heavy as gold, and itis more enduring.
None but an export can detect the difference, and
then only by the severest tests. Ornaments made
from this new composition are equal in design and
general appearance to those made of the finest
18-carat gold, and yet we sell them at but a tithe of
the Cost of the genuine goods.
Remember that we do not pretend that Oriental
Gold is anything but a composition of pure metals;
but we do allirm that it is so perfect an imitation
of the sterling gola as to almost defy detection.
Jewellery made of It may be worn anywhere, and
the closest inspection will only strengthen the con-
viction that it is real gold. So perfect is It. and so
large has our trada become, that jewellers through-
out the colonies are complaining of the dullness
in trade, and are constantly writing to us to secure
our goods for their own customers. Rut as we are
Sole Agents for these colonies, we prefer to deal
directly with the public. All of our Oriental Gold
Jewellery is made to our order, and is stamped
with our trade mark. You can order anything
from a Scarf Pin to a Watch and Chain, and it will
be sent Post Free, and at our risk, on receipt of
price.
SPECIALLY OBSERVE.
Should you be dissatisfied with your investment
after inspecting the articles, re-pack them at once
and send them back to us. If this is done within
two days—or where mails are few, by the first post
after receipt, and the articles are not injured—we
will return the money, deducting only the trifle
expended on postage. You can keep any one
article and return the rest, and we will refund the
money for the articles not retained. Fair dealing
is our motto, and we bind ourselves to give satis-
faction. Examine our catalogue, and send in your
order for what you may require.
N.B —We find that, through an error on the part
of the manufacturers, we are overstocked with
Brooches, and for the purpose of making a rapid
clearance of that lino of Goods, wo will send to
any customer (post free, if ata distance) on receipt
of Five Shillings (5s.), a really exquisite Oriental
uold Brooch, equal in design, finish, and appear-
ance to a Five Guinea Brooch of the sterling metal.
This offer holds good for a few weeks only, and is
made as much for the purpose of advertising our
Oriental Jewellery by sample as for any other
reason ; for the Brooches will keep, and they are
of the latest design. “To see is to want,” is a
saying so applicable to our goods, that it pays us,
in the long run, to forward to any person a sample
Brooch at price. Examine our catalogue, and
write to us or call on us for what you may desire.

The uses to which electricity has been
adapted in these days surpass the wildest dreams
of the enthusiasts of a century ago. In compari-
son with the adaptability of this subtle power to
man’s convenience and happiness, the adapt * Dili y
of other forces appears tame and commonplace.
With the speed of thought, it conveys messages
over pathless wilds, through burning deserts, over-
head in the air, and deep down along the beds of
turbulent seas. Where its services will slop, the
wisest cannot presume to say. In the railway
train, the tram-car, and the huge ocean-going
ship, it is rapidly displacing steam. But it is
equally adapted for overcoming the thousand-
aud-one petty inconveniences or every-day life—
inconveniences, separately of small account, but
aggregately immense. Its application has foiled
the buiglar, added additional safe-guards to the
cause of law and order, and placed in the hands of
authority a potent power for detecting crime. At

We have had so much comic opera and
thing or other lately that our head hurts, and
°“Vp rapidly losing tiesh. Just for a change we
"he Opera House, Saturday nmht. to see
» nivon-ons.” As the Widow O’Brien says: “ Per-
i,ans ver not Frinch loike meself, and won’t know
to pronounce Divorcons. Well, pronounce it
ipvorsongs, and then you’ll be right. We know
' *,, n p e right, for we heard Tom Price speak it
thnf wav t’other night, and he is so awlully Fre ;ch
that but the hind lea of a frog comes any-
where near his Idea of the eternal litness of things.
The pi y is a new one. That is. It is new to the
Anstral an public, and the longer it remains that
«av the better it will be for the public and those
who try to produce it. It was written origin dly by
Victorien Sardou, during one of his moments of
lunacy, and “adapted for the stage” by some other
lunatic who didn’t know that we should ever see
u As a play, it isn’t worth powder enough to
iiinw up one of its lightest characters, and the
uurhor of “Fedora” and other pieces of that
atamn ought to sue himself for defamation of
character for allowing bis name to be connected
w th it. The plot is good enough to have hinged
Tome sparkling comedy work on, but the piece
iopW-r the lustre which characterises such high-
eiass comedy as “Forget-Me-Not” and “The
oueen’s Favourite.” A couple get married. This
is Monsieur de Prunelles (Mr. James Carden)
and Madame de Prunelles (Miss Jennie Lee).
The Monsieur is considerably older than his wife,
and as a matter of course, she is somewhat
vounger than he. The Madame isn’t particularly
in love with her spouse, and gets up a desperate
flirtation with Adhemar (Mr. George Forbes). In
fhe meantime, the Monsieur is getting in his work,
and the way he dirts with Madame de Brianne
(Blanche Lewis) is positively awful. Both are
waiting for the passage of the Divorce Bill, then
before the French Assembly, so that they may be
free from the ties which hind them only to assume
others that couldn’t help being a confounded sight
worse. Finally, they get to be honest enough to
fell each other the truth, and they quietly agree to
disagree. Bach allows the other all the rope
wanted, and it might be made really amusing to
watch the process by which they gradually hang
themselves. Presently they begin to find out that
they are not exactly unsuited for each other, and
the result is that after a short flirtation they fall
desperately in love, and wouldn’t have a divorce
on any account.
♦ • »
While watching this play, we couldn’t help
thinking of a lot of men and women we know who
during their courtship were sweeter to each other
than a handful of French caramels; after they got
married, however, all the little courtesies ceased,
and neither desired to want to please the other at
all It Maria complained, John would tell her that
courting a girl was just like a man choosing a
street car: after he caught the car, he didn’t keep
on running like a blamed fool, but quietly took a
seat and enjoyed himself. After men get married,
that is some men, they seem to imagine that they
have caught their street cars, and all they’ve got
to do is to sit down and read the paper and smoke
and spit on the floor quite regardless of anything.
We have heard Bob Ingersoll delivering one of his
fascinating lectures, and in the course of it he said
that “ a man should never grow weary of courting
his wife.” The idea is a little funny, isn’t it ? But
we know a lot of men who think it pays; and it
does seem to do so, somehow, for their homes are
happier, and there is an expression on their faces
that married men don t wear as a rule. But, per-
haps you would like to know what this all has to
do with the play. Gentle reader, it hasn’t anything
to do with the play; but if we were to write just
what we think about “ Divorvons,” the author
would go off and die somewhere. and the managers
who intend producing it would be hunting us with
shot-guns and cork-screws, and things like that.

Mr. James Carden’s Monsieur de Prunelles
was a clever bit of acting, and so thoroughly
natural that we couldn’t help remarking how much
he looked like a real, live married man. Carden
always reads his lines well; and whether he looks
a character or not, he acts It so well that we can
never tell what we like him best in. Jennie Lee
played Madame de Prunelles in a captivating wa v,
but we can’t help insisting that, she is just a little
too much like a larrlkmess to suit us in characters
such as Madame de Prunelles. But this isn’t alto-
gether to be wondered at, for Jennie has made a
study of the larrikin character so long that It
might reasonably be expected to come like second
nature to her. Every time we see Jenny Lee in
trousers we are sorry she wasn’t born so that they
could call her John, or Harry, or Claude, or some-
thing like that. Every time we see her in gown
and petticoats, we are cross because she didn’t go
to the fame school that we used to, and eat philo-
poenas with us until the other boys were green
with envy. But, there, we can't have everything
we want, and have learned to be patient.
• • *
We missed Mr. Burnett from the cast. We
don’t know that he ever played in “ Divorvons,”
but we have grown so used to seeing him on the
stage with Jennie Lee, that the place seems strange
when he is not in it. Oily Deering played Gog o in
a way that would break your heart to look at.
Oily is so funny at times that he can’t look in a
mirror without surprising himself into a laugh.
Off the stage, he is just as funny and irrepressible.
He belongs to the Imps, and his fines during the
evening lor contempt of the Arch Fiend, or the
society, or something, amount to about three
pounds ten a week. Edwin Palmer played like his
old self as Colonel Baston; but we must close this
paragraph for the present. On Saturday night of
this week, “The Shaughran ” will be presented at
the Opera House, with Jennie Lee as Con the
Shaughraun. Of course, you will want to see the
little actress in this character, for she always acts
the man better than most people who were born
that way.
* * * *
We didn’t intend to go near the Baldwins
again, for the Profe : sor said that he didn’t care to
try reading a man s mind if he didn’t have any.
You remember, he failed with us, and had the im-
pertinence to tell us that our mind wasn’t big
enough to read with a fifteen hundred ton micro-
scope. But we happened to meet Mrs. Baldwin,
and she told us to •‘dojeome down,” because the
Professor was going to “ explain all his tricks this
week, and show how It’s all.doae.” We knew the
Professor over in America, where he had the re-
putation of being a silver-toned liar of the first
description. Had he told us what Mrs. Baldwin
did we wouldn’t have believed him; hue w« ■went,
anyway, and now we know how it's all done. The
Professor really explained his most puzzling tricks.
Mrs. Baldwin escaped from the pillory on the open
stage, and the Piofessor opened handcuffs, untied
ropes, and threw tire from his finger tips, until we
began to believe that he had been shaking hands
with the devil. Now we are open for an engage-
ment, and intend to break the bloomin’ Protessor
up in business. But we want to tell you another
thing which the Professor did. He asked the
audience to all think of one thing, and he’d tell
them what it was. After a bit, he Dlinked his eyes
a bit, as though he'd been out the night be-
fore, and then he said, “It was a cussed
shame to Hog poor Anderson.” Then the
people cheered, and said “ kerrect ’’—but we
aren’t so sure that they wouldn’t have cheered
just the same if anybody else had got up and
uttered the same sentiment. We considered that
the Professor’s weakest trick, and believe that he
did it just to hoodwink folks, for he asked us out
to drina after the show was over, and told us that
“everybody don’t know everything—not by a
durneu sight.” As we smacked our lips, we found
time to ejaculate that " they were, and no mistake
—spirits included.” Then we proceeded to include
the spirits for which the Protessor had paid, and
now we are as happy as a hilly-goat with a new set
of horns. The Baldwins go away shortly, and
open at Orange, we believe. The worst thing we
wish them is good luck, for their show is certainly
worth the money; and then the Professor
* shouts ” every time we meet him, and that
makes a lot of difference in our estimate of a show.
• * • *
The Gaiety was better filled the last time
we went there to see Stanley’s Juveniles In “ Pin-
afore.” Perhaps you don’t know who Pinafore
is? Well, you may remain in ignorance, if you
don't, unless you go to see the Juveniles. And do
you know we couldn’t help chuckling just a little
when the villain behind us whispered to bis mate
that the piece was quite appropriate for the
Juveniles, as most or them were scarcely old
enough to leave otf wearing pinafores. The
attempt at a pun didn’t strike us as being par-
ticularly brilliaut, but it was well meant, and
that weighs a heap with us. Usually we have a
downright horror of " child’’-ponormances, and
certainly do not go to witness them only when
dire necessity compels. The last juvenile troupe
we saw was a “Pinafore” push that Professor
Ballwin was running through the United States
and Canada. It was a better outfit that Stanley s,
which shows alack of training—stage-mamgement
we should say, if we weren’t afraid of interfering
with somebody’s salary. Captain Corcoran was
assumed (?) by Master R. Stephenson. The lad is a
good little actor, and makes the part quite attrac-
tive. Amy child’s Ralph Rackstraw was rather an
ambitious undertaking for a mere child, but she
went through it with a grace and skill that we
hardly expected. The first thing her folks know,
we'll be waiting lor that girl to grow up. Amy is
a pretty little dancer, and the beauty of it is that
she isn’t qrite old enough to know it yet.
• • •
Dolly Juman played Sir Joseph Porter,
She didn’t play it exactly, but she tried it, and
failed abominably, not tor lack of talent, but tor
lack of training. Dick Deadeye, too (Willie Dns-
c ill), was about as “ far off ” as anything we have
ever seen. He has a fair voice and good action,
but the stage manager or somebody else should
tell him not to slap his thigh too far back in the
presence of company. This Is only one little point,
of course, but the whole idea of the Stanley
“push ” seems to be to burlesque “ Pinafore,” and
to burlesque a satirical burlesque of such great
fame requires just a little more ability and a lot
better training than the kids at the Gaiety know
anything about. But now we have stayed long
enough at “ Pinafore,” and are not going back to
the Gaiety until next Saturday, when the Juve-
niles are to reproduce “the gorgeous burlesque
and pantomime” of “Jack, the Giant-killer.
We’ll not exactly promise to go then, but we may
if the right kind of carriage and pa:r is sent around
for us, and Stanley doesn't get on his ear at what
we have written this week.
* * * *
We went to the Minstrels again the other
night, and had a good laugh at the antics of the
four corner-men. There are Keenan and Hussey
on the bones, and Bent and Cowan on the tambo.
Yea: and there is poor Ball in the middle, who has
to take the brunt of all the jokes, and look just as
happy as though they pleased him clear out of his
skin. Wc wouldn’t Use to bo a middle man. The
last one we knew was Ainsley Scott. You remem-
ber him, of course, for he was out here several
years ago. If you don’t remember him, his tailor
and several other people do. But we were going
to tell you that the last time we saw Ainsley he
was running down Kearney-street, San Francisco,
with a woman shouting after him. Ainsley's
work tells on him, and that is probably what
makes him so slim. But Ball is so tat and jolly
that every time we look at him we wonder how he
can be happy and contented in the atmosphere of
such old jokes as be sometimes has to breathe.
♦ * * *
By the time the lights went down and the
curtain up on Saturday night the Royal was
packed like a court when the prosecuting counsel
blows his nose preparatory to reading the spicy
billets in a divorce suit. “ Patience ” was the piece.
Considering that the aesthetic fad, to which this
burlesque owes whatever little raison d' etre it
possesses, never became iepldemic in Australia —
never attacked us in ’ he virulent form it assumed
In London some years ago when Mayfair found
relief from the ennui of life in slobbering over
sunflowers, knee-breeches, chipped pottery, and
tow-headed epictmes of both sexes—th« cause
of the success of “Patience” is not so easy
to be guessed. For the success of a tra-
vesty, however good, usually depends on a
close acquaintanceship with the thing travestied
“Don Quixote” and “Gulliver’s Travels” would
be as unmeaning as one of Bladen’s madrigals if
we were in the dark regarding the things they
were written to ridicule.
ft • •
Well, the curtain rose, and the twenty for-
lorn maidens began their little chirrup. The
scraggy ones appeared to gravitate towards the
wings, leaving the centre to some really credit-
able specimens of full-blooded protoplasm. One
maid in the middle attracted as much of our
attention as we could spare from a stout lidy
in front of us, who showed her appreciation of
Sullivan’s music by a running criticism on the
Anderson flogging case, and the risks many reput-
able churchwardens ran should the police and
magistrates continue their crusade against gal-
lantry. It was as well, perhaps, that the maid in
question kept in the background. Her appearance
suogested a lot of things—among others, a closer
acquaintance with tripe and stout tnan with
ideality. This suggestiveneas was not banished
when Miss Montague appeared as Patience. We
are far from saying that Annis could fill her “ pro-
gramme” w,th either steak and onions or Barclay
and Perkins. We merely hint that, as she appeared
on Saturday, she didn’t seem like one whom a
senna leaf would affect or the smell of a daffy-
dowa-ddly satisfy. But she carolled as blithely as
a linnet, and carried the milumg-pail with a pro-
fessional abandon that elicited noisy approval
from the pit. accompanied with the remark from
a foreign lady slti log behind us, in green silk and
fourteen-button gloves, “Bedad, whin I luk at ’er,
I think o’the ouldbor-on in Galway, an’ Darby
thro win’ down his flail to lift me an’ me milk over
the style, never dbramin’ o’ the time whin he’d be
a C.M.G. an’ me a layther o’ fashion.”
* * *
j here are soldiers in the piece—officers,
rather; for, in the British service as wo knew it,
long before the rather loutish young dragoon
sleep mg beside us had blossomed into the greatest
war-correspondent and the greatest—ahem ! —of
the age, the soldier daren’t assume to be an officer,
and the officer disdained to be considered a so'dier.
And the sheen of those wan iors’ helmets on Satur-
day night brought back the long, dusty, sweltering
field days at Aldershot, when Her Gracious Majesty
and her cousin Cambridge (Prince George, you
remember, who played such havoc amongst the
Russians in the Crimea that Czar Nicholas, to save
the poor Muscovites, had to intrigue for the ter-
rible liro-eater's recall to England) drew up at the
saluting point, and we dare-devils swept proudly
by, hungry, but patriotic. The dragoons in
“ Patience ” recalled all this One honest swash-
buckler, we noticed, carefully avoided the trap-
door while marking time. 11 was, perhaps as well
—both for him and the door. And yet, had it
given way, he would not have been altogether lost
to us. His legs, of course, might disappear, but-
barring the opening was constructed to let a hearse
or a furniture-van through—he would still have a
chance to finish his chirrup. Should an irruption
of French rascaldom ever call Australians to the
tented field, we pity the regiment of Zouaves this
fire-brand runs foul of. But, of course, he'll have
to be properly mounted-say, on a hippopotamus
or a lorry.
• • •
During a tussle with a clarionet obligato,
Annis shyly told us that she was “light and gay.”
That she was gay anyone could see, out there was
some diversi y of opinion about her lightness. It
sometimes hard to translate the demonstrative-
ness of an audience—to say whether it means ap-
probation or irony. When Mr. Charles Turner, for
instance, meandered on and said to Annis, “ 1 am
beautiful, ’ there appeared to be some expressions
of dissent, more or less emphatic. This struck us
us odd, for we have seen Charles in many oircum-
stances—In the street, at the bar, being shampooed,
and even straggling with a plate of corned beef.
Once we thought wo recognised him in the Water
Police Court, but of this we can’t be certain.
Anyway, he always appeared lovelv to us, so we
can't make out why the audience—[There. This is

Some people have no brains, but they have
•an unlimited supply of cheek. A certain New
.'Zealand banker is one of these. One of the bank's
late customers has a charming wife, and the man-
ager had been in the habit of visiting her fre-
quently and turning over the music while she
played. Under such circumstances, it is not to be
wondered at that the husband's overdraft should
have increased by leaps and bounds. It was the
only satisfaction he could think of that suited and
soothed his particular complaint, and ho made the |
most of it. Still, a time came when, although the i
did rjof *>bate bis visits, he gave bis client J
to understand that, in future, he must decline to
honour his cheques. This was bad enough, but
when the client one day met a bailiff in the street
who served him with a writ for his overdraft, it
took him somewhat short. He went home in a
gloomy frame of mind, intending to ask his wife to
help him to curse all banks and bankers, limited
and unlimited; but when he entered his own par-
lour and found the lady playing the piano and the
manager calmly and complacently turning over
the music, he simply yelled out, “You internal
scarecrow, clear out of this domicile like a shot, or,
by Sir Julius Vogel, I’ll kick your insignificant
carcase into everlasticg Hades before you know
where you are.” The husband’s boots were No.
18’s heavily ironed, and carried fourteen-stone
good weight in full activity; the banker was a
smallish man—cheek was his great mainstay, butit
tailed him on this occasion, and he bolted from the
premises and never came back. The overdraft has
since been written off the bank’s books as a bad
debt and the manager removed to a more salu-
brious locality.

The unlearned heathen often gives the
clever Christian a nasty jar. That’s just what the
untutored Maori, Titokowaru, did when brought
up before a New Zealand bench, charged with
using threatening language. The sturdy old war-
rior, not getting the hang of the proceedings*
pleaded through the interpreter, “guilty.” The
Bench, however, under the circumstances, thought
it would seem more just to take the evidence and
give Tito a chance. Freely translated, this is
how the sequel ran. Interpreter: “ The Bench
won’t let you say you’re guilty; they say you’re
not guilty.” Tito: “Good” (and he wrapped his
blanket round him, and proceeded cheerfully to
clear out of the dock). Interpreter: “But you
mustn’t go; they’ve got to try you yet.” Tito
(bewildered): “It they say I’m not guilty, why in
sulphur do they want to try me at all?” Inter-
preter: “You see, you might turn out guilty,
after all” Tito: “Well, didn’t I say I was, and
they say I’m not.” Interpreter; “Just so; that’s
it.” The Bench: “Tell him we’ve written him
down in this big bookasnotguilty.” Tito: “That’s
a sanguinary lie; I said 1 was guilty.” The Bench
(pompously): “ Cali the first witness.” Tito (with
an amused air of resignation); “ Well, I always
thought these Pakehas were d—d fools.”

Talk about a goldarned libel on the whole
of the Rockhampton constabulary foorce ; read
this. A few days ago, a certain Samson up there
was on a brief visit to a Delila who runs a shanty
for the accommodation of single men and their
wives, a few miles outside the township. About 1
a.m., a facetious cuss of a cabby, named Yankee
Dick, undertook to give the gay sojourner a bit of
a shaking up, and he accordingly began to thunder
at the door, like Richard Coeur de Lion at the gates
of Ascalon. “Jumpin’ Jezabel,” screamed Delila;
“ here’s them gory coppers a breakin’ in on us.”
And Samson, being a valiant hero, immediately
hauled off and went scooting through the bush at
the rate of something over a mile a minute.
He was overhauled and arrested by the spor-
tive cabby and a friend, who proceeded to
escort him into the local lock-up. The genu-
ine police got wind of the fun, however,
and, just by way of adding a little novelty to the
programme, they promptly ran Dick and his mate
themselves into quod. Next day, the pair of jokers
toed the scratch to answer to a charge of personat-
ing the foorce, and the following dialogue en-
sued. Police Magistrate: “Did the prisoners tell
you they were constables ?” Piosecutor; “ Umps;
they did, yer Wusship.” P.M.: “Did you, at the
time, believe they were ?” P,; “ I did, at first, yer
Wusship.” P.M.; “ What caused you to alter your
opinion?” P.; “Well, it kem about like this, sir.
I wuz a bit soared, an’ so I arst the fust feller an’
the other cove to come an’ do a liquor, an’ take a
crown a-piece an’ say no more about where they
foun’ me, an’ both ov them refused. Then I knew
they couldn’t be jinyuine Rockhampton traps, an*
so I cleared an’ give th’ infermashln’.” “ Sollince

the Bench went out in the yard and kicked itself
to check a fit of laughter.

The colossal conceit of America is about
to be colossally perpetuated. When we say about
to be, we mean about to begin to think of starting
to be. The statue of Liberty, which they talk of
erecting in New York, is to be 151ft. 3ln. high, and
is to stand on a pedestal 177ft. 9in. high. It will be
the Tenth Wonder of the World, Our new Land
Bill is, of course, the Ninth Wonder. You will re-
member that the Colossus of Rhodes was the
Eighth Wonder, and yet it was only lOJfeet. high—
that is to say, 46ft. lower than the proposed Ameri-
can statue, not counting the pedestal of the latter.
Do you know the real reason why the liAmericans
are raising this statue? No ? Well, it is that they
shall have something in the coming time by which
io remember that they once had such a thing as
liberty in the land. Just that. If you don’t be-
lieve us, ask Gerald Massey.

HE CALLED BOUND.
It was a new chum, who
Out here was sternly sent.
And who got on a tear.
And therefore owed his rent.
Of course it was a “ pull ”! *
And let him thus be chaffed:
Before his d-id “gotxcind”
He’d drunk his little draft.
It was an awful baw—
Had brother rich somewhere:
Rich brother would come round
And make the thing all square,
“ Can’t make out where he is:” —
And then, why. we declare!
Upon the floor there stood
The new chum’s oldest frere.
“ Saved! ” cried the new chum; “Yes,”
The other said —“ ’tis true;
I am your brother, but
1 am the bailiff, too.

Two verses from a poem on “Kindness,’
in the Morpeth Times :—
“ How deep within my heart doth rest
The deed in kindness done!
Ever remains within this breast,
Till life’s short journey’s run.
“ Thou who snatched me f rom the mire,
Degradation, alas! and sin I
Placed me on a rock much higher,
Formed me a new path to begin.”
Two of our own:—
Unhappy youth I how small a store
Of knowledge thou hast gleaned—
Or, sure, thou wouldst have known before
Th\ friend was but a fiend
He would have been a friend entire—
Thou, stainless of such verse—
If he had “snatched thee from the mire,”
And jammed thee in a hearse

company had to follow suit much against their

Press was the concentrated essence of corned-

We have been much hurt of late to notice
the spread of a ridiculous rumour to the effect
that the devil is dead. If any of our readers have
been led astray by this heartless hoax, let them be
warned in time by the fate of a man of Mossgiel.
We quote from a country exchange:—“A store-
keeper in Mossgiel has been missing since Monday
He came to Hay to buy some horses, and had been
drinking slightly. On Monday night hra went to
bed. At about 10 a tall dark man called for him
and went into his bedroom. Since then, he has
! never been seen or heard of, although the police
t have made every inquiry.” Miserere, Dominc! We
wonder nobody noticed whether the “ tall dark
man ” was dressed in a flamc-coloured suit or not ?
But, after all, that is of no consequence. The
devil—no person of a religious mind can doubt that
the tall dark man was the devil —can change the
fashion of his apparel to suit the taste of the time.
We should not be surprised if his garb on this oc-
casion included a broad-brimmed hat and gaiters-
Another point to which we respectfully draw the
attention of the Protestant Standard—the great
authority upon all matters connected with Kell-
is that the devil seems to have altered his hours of
calling. It was formerly the usual thing for him
to drop in upon his customers at midnight. The
case of Doctor Faustus is a proof of this. You re-
member the Doctor in Marlowe’s play 7 , watching
the clock and waiting for the Evil One to c >me to
claim his soul. The moments seem to whirl madly
on; the hands are near the hour. Then he cries
out in his despairing agony, “ 0 lente, \cnte currite,
tioctes equee ’’—and all that thereafter follows. But
now it seems that Satan makes his appearance two
hours,earlier. Perhaps Increase of business will
account for this. Anyhow, beloved brethren, it is
a sombre and terrible thing to think that the
Enemy of Mankind is still going about like a roar-
ing bush missionary, seeking whom he may de-
vour. The only safeguard in these days for thof e
who wish to save their souls, is to rally together
and send in their subscriptions to this office at
once. Lose no time! Terms, twenty-four shillings
a year—in advance. The devil will never touch
anyone who takes this paper. P.S.—He is one of
our most esteemed contributors.

A reporter read to a splitter that Glad-
stone had recently felled a tree two feet in
diameter in three hours. "Now, do you call that
good time,” he said, “for instance, what would
you get for a job like that?” “The sack,” he
replied.
When asked for ketchup by an indignant
boarder, Joseph at once ordered it up; but, on the
“residential resider” (now, Alf.I) making a too
free use of this condiment, Joseph said that any-
one would think ho was “ irritating the Egyptian
Cheops.”
Vanity Fair gives us the intelligence that
Down Place, Colonel Harford’s estate, has been
let to a wealthy Australian. Now 25,000 Browns
out hero are going round to the little shop, and
telling the oleomargarine merchant that the party
is their uncle.
Jumbuek called for whisky, and the bar-
maid handed him the bottle. He stretched out
his hand for it, but the girl, grasping it by the
neck, shouted. “Sixpence, please.” “ What's your
hurry?” stammered Jumbuek does it kill so
d quick ?”
The Armidalb Chronicle is angry with
us about something. Whats up ? The editor
sajs “we have managed to grasp one of his
leaders.” He must have noticed that when reading
his paper we always wear gloves. This is milder
than saying tongs.
Mr. Dibbs walked across to oneof the worn-
out stom wallers, who was asleep and snoring like
a blast furnace, and, taking him gently by the
hand, whispered, so as not to disturb him. “ Hear,
hear, old fellow, one of the best speechesyou ever
made in yourli e.”
The Dean of Bangor has committed suicide.
He hanged himself In hi» bed-room was a volume
of Dora’s Bible, opened at the picture of “Joshua
commanding th • 8un” to stand still. If Josh,
lived in these degenerate days, by the way, he’d
have to go to a night school.
This is a step in the right direction : how
would it act over here? Victorian authorities now
declare they are fully determined to put down
gambling, burgling, and all offences of a similar
nature, even if they have to arrest every police-
man in the Cabbage Garden.
It is reported that when the members
entered their railway carriage and found the waif
there, one hon. gentleman didn’t wait for the
child to awaken, but, coughing behind his hand,
suddenly said he thought he’d walk. And—hem !—
there was no moon that night.
At Lismore the magistrates recently non-
suited a plaintiff without any apparent cause. It
afterwards transpired that it was on account of
the papers in the case having been mislaid—the
C.P.S. having Inadvertently taken them home
wrapped round a pair of boots.
The Gunnedah Advertiseb announces
that “weekly numbers of their weekly journals
will be given away to subscribers as a Christmas
box. 1 ’ Then no one will be any better off. For
the Gunnedah paper seems to publish “ Christ-
mas ” numbers all the year round.
Newcastle Hanby reports a lengthy meet-
ing to back the establishment of the Great
Northern Temperance Advocate, and being
anxious to be on the popular side, assured the
chairman, effusively, that if he would come outside
he would gladly drink it every success.
Dr. Slate, who has just returned from Fiji,
and who the Flu Times says has earned “golden
opinions,” is pensive on the subject of this report.
“Golden opinions.” Thunder 1 That’s exactly
wha r the Rum says it has been earning, The staff ,
however, has still a yearning eye for sausages.
A correspondent at Boree Creek writes to
the Albury Banner: “A live curiosity, worth
going a mile to see, is to be seen at Mr. Jackson's,
ip the shape of a sheep of the male gender with
two mouths.” The bidding for the animal is very
brisk between the leaders of the Opposition and
Mr. Stuart.
Thanks of a sixpenny restaurant have been
tendered to the Evening News for its genial sup-
port. This is so grim a joke that we cannot follow
it up. Fancy the whole staff turning up, and
[We run this paper to amuse and instruct, and
wish not to take the bread out of any man’s mouth.
We, therefore, refuse to refer further to the
matter.—Ed. B ]
The other day a man named Livingstone
hanged himself in Brisbane, because he was in-
solvent. If some of our plate-humpers here
hanged themselves every time they were insol-
vent, they would require as many lives as a cat. It
is just these parties who would be disposed to
“Guy ” Livingstone.
We read in a Maitland paper of “some of
the ablest pressmen who ever wrote for Sydney
Punch,” but there is no mention of the silent sub-
scribers who now repose untimely in Rookwood,
after having rashly read that paper. Montague,
Hicks, Dally, Sherry Moore, how will you answer
for It in the judgment ?
In one of the times we were married, hav-
ing carefully studied the daily papers, we, when
our wife was sick and wanted the doctor, always
placed the gardener in the next room with a meat-
axe. But this grew too expensive. For, on one
occasion, the gardener killed the doctor, and we
had to buy a new meat-axe.
Be the “ G ” puzzle in the Fortnightly
Review, Archibald Forbes thinks that the said
letter stands for Escott, the editor of the said
Review. We don’t; the thing’s grossly impro-
bable. That the “ G."-signed foreign policy article
in question was written by Herbert Gladstone is a
theory far more likely to gee.
The Townsville people thought they had
got rid of their P.M., as tne last Government gave
him six months' leave of absence unasked. But
he has turned up again. The welcome accorded
him on his return is said to be unique. Only a
goat and the bellman turned out to escort him to
his residence, and it was his own goat.
It is “de rigger ” (Alfred) in the sixpenny
restaurants lor every i-ook before rolling pastry
to spit on his hands. If a cook didn’t spit on
his hands the Association would probably kill him.
You see—what we mean is—at least—but as we
remarked before, Chris, drives a mab-phaetou and
pair, and the “ world is mad, my masters.”
We were hunting for news in the Wollon-
gong Argus, when we fell prone on this for some
descriptive writing. Manfully did we struggle
through a column commencing “ Down at Shell-
harbour—By our Itinerant Scribe.—Weare content
to die now;” and, with all Christian resignation,
we are just able to gasp out “ so are we.”
The Cairns Post man maintains that the
Port Dougla?sers are a lot of geese—to which soft
impeachrnoat jthe P.D. organ owns up, qualifying
the admission, however, with " but, then, that is
much preterrable (.sic) to being a lot of senseless
goslings.” How true it is that a soft (in the above
case a very soft) anser turneth away wrath.
Iu referring to the late Mi. Daniel Wil-
liams, the Herald says: “ Mr. Williams arrived in
Victoria in 1831, where, after undegoiog the usual
routine of nearly all the ea>Jy colonists, he com-
menced as a contractor, ana carried out many
contracts of a public and private nature.” This is
a nice way of sending a respectable corpse along.
A London curate was recently brought up
for travelling on the railway line without the
necessary “ spons.” He got a month. Subse-
quently an application was made by his lawyer
through the medium of some evangelical indivi-
duals, and the sentence was reduced to 40s. line.
Tae only question now under debate regarding
the rev. gentleman is what shall be the value of
the testimonial to him.
From Alfred Nell. Come back; all
well in future. A.”—
Come back, come back, oh, sweetest Nell,
Or it will be his doom;
Come back—let us advise you, dear.
To come back with a broom.
No time to double-rhyme.
Professor Clelland, of Glasgow, has stated
that the animal form of man has now reached the
last possible vertebrate development, which is the
academic way of saying that the backbone of man
has reached such a stage that no further alteration
for the better may be hoped for. But he has
never been here to investigate how nature may
have resources outside his theory. How else do
the Ministry stand, who have not even the rudi-
ment ?
’Twas but a short time back, and Sydney
Smith was the Nooze’s white-headed boy, and
now the “ largest circulation ” puts it about that
Syd.’s brain doesn’t control his tongue. This, one
would have thought at the first blush, should have
endeared Syd. still more to his Alf.: on reflection,
however, one is bound to admit that it’s only
another instance of the truth of the maxim, “ The
faults that people most hate in other people are
their own.”
This is what we do so like. The fellow
who fixed it up we literally yearn to embrace.
Granny had best be car ful of him lest Alf.
seduce him away. This is it: “ Melbourne Tues-
day.—His Excellency the Governor, Lady Loch,
the Misses Loch. Master Loch, and suite visited the
Zoological Gardens to-day.” There is a great
future before the pressman who can turn out
work of that kind. Why, the “Brevities” man i
a witless buffoon to him.
We were about to give Adelong a jerk along
by saying that The Argus was about to be started
there, when we stumbled on this in the Gundagai
Herald: “That the Adelong Argus is but the
Tujiut Slow-Poach under another name.” We
don’t shrink from iffering our candid opinion
about the intrigues between tho Courts of Peters-
burg. Berlin, Paris, and London; but when we
would venture to dabble with Adelong and Tumut,
and tiundagal, wo pause—*ve simply pause.
Says the oracular “Town Talker ” of the
Herald Reverbi.ration : ‘ There are only two
kinds of people who talk ‘ bosh ’—very silly people,
and very clever people.” Now, if there is one
thing that Jack Runsby was remarkable for, it was
for being too silly or too profound, and for the
“ Talker ” to narrow down his “ talk ” to these two
possible alternatives, is to claim to be very silly or
very clever. After mature consideration, we have
decided that the “Talker” Is not silly, but too
clever—by half.
We don’t believe it; but we are authori-
tatively told that on the day of the opening of the
Pyrmont Bridge, by direction of the Company the
following articles were left at the Hum office: One
lead-pencil, a pair of shoes, half a cake of tobacco,
an empty kerosene-tin, nine keys, and a German
sausage. The News office, so our correspondent
states, only benefited by the following articles: A
pair of socks, two onions, a copper watch-guard, a
parcel of potatoes, and a high-class literary work
(presumably for review).
Scene: Back-door of public-house in a
bush township, where the “sargint” is known to
bo on the alert. Time, Sunday morning, early.
Little boy (loq.): “Please, father wants a bob’s
worth o’ dark brandy.” Publican: “All right;
where’s yo.r bottle?” L.B.: “Ain’t got none,
daren’t bring it.” Publican: "I’ll have to charge
you with one then.” L.B.;“ No, yer don’t! ’Ere,
just you pour it on this ’andkercher, an’ dad ’ll
squeeze it out when I gits back.”
The following ad. is some printing from
the gorgeous House of Hooke:—
“ KOYAL HOTEL,
TAJU WORTH,
THOS. KING,
PROFFER ROIETOR ”
We did not think that you, dear Hooke,
Were e'er from home a rover;
But, there! we want you just to look,
And own (hie) Easter’s over.
The News says, in a brevity: “ We do not
publish anonymous communications.” Of course
not! What with Chris, to do the Society business,
and Frank as London correspondent, outside scrib-
blers have but a poor show. Then there is Hen-
niker Heaton, who executes, sam doute, the Club
mems. We are sorry, though, that Alf. has limited
himself to his own immediate staff. For we
thought, our-elves, of contributing to his paper
(for his approbation) a humorous dissertation upon
the Innate thoughts of the cat-fish. Also, an essay
on tripo regarded as high art. Bnt our dream
has faded.
TO CORRESPONDENTS.

plume cannot expect to have their com-
munications noticed.]
“Justice” : We are very much obliged for

This is the sort of “swill” you send. Now, had
Sladen sent it, there would be no particular cause
to'grumble. But that anybody else in New South
Wales should hre this stuff into us Ins kept us

Go to! Thou art a soused gurnet.
Even in vehicles there Is an element of na-
tionality, and every nation flatters itself on pos-
sessing: the best adapted to its wants. But to the
American buggy alone the true character of cos-
mopolitism beiongs. It is everywhere at home,
alike in the country to which it owes its invention,
the sterile steppes of central Russia, the well-kept
highways of Britain, the primitive roadways of
Japan, or the wide-spreading plains of Australia.
Of course, the dishonest imitator has been at
work. Such an opportunity for foisting an in-
ferior and rlcketty wrticle on an unwary public
was sure to be seized by the unscrupulous. For a
staunch article adapted for all dim tes and all
roads —a vehicle that defies competition—you
must go to Fleming's American Carnage Reposi-
tory, 33 and 34 tlarence-strest, Sydney.*
It was a bright Spring day last week when
the B.M.S. Ballarat enle.ed Sydney Heads and
steamed slowly up our oeautitul harbour, she
had experienced a rough Mine of it across the
Indian ocean, and yet all on board had managed to
enjoy themselves right well. The fiddle in the
forecastle and the piano in the saloon had relieved
the monotony of ship life, and “the merry sound
of music and of dance ” had re ounded from stem
to stern with little intermission. The cargo under
hatches was a valuable one—such a one as proves
the indomitable spirit that guides the genius of
manufacture at home, alvays finding an echo of
improvement and advancement from every corner
of our colony. The cargo was valuable—it was
also important from a special point of view, for
down in the dark depths of fhe deep hold were
over three hundred cases of the loveliest millinery
mantles, and other articles that a lady ever wore,
and they can now be seen at Anthony Hordern
and Sons, the Palace Emporium, Haymarket.*

AMERICAN BUGGIES.
I ike a great many other articles of manufacture, a Buggy can be made to sell for next to nothing,
at the same time bear a very passable appearance. Hundreds are brought into the colonies, and sold,
of inferior grades, that could not be detected except by one thoroughly up to the trade in America-
The manufacture of cheap vehicles has grown to an alarming extent in the United States, and still
you cannot gainsay the representation of the manufacturers that it is an honest made article. But
look over his stock of timber ; the quantity may cover acres, and not one spoke tit to be put into a
wheel to ensure it standing a hard road. Thousands are manufactured annually and sent to country
towns to be auctioned off. They are therefore named auction buggies, and stand very well for twelve
months or so on a good mud or sand road ; but use theta one month ona metal road i

SPORTING AND ATHLETIC MEMS.
The gate-money fever has attacked even
our Senior Rowing 1 Club.
A new bowling club has been started in
Newcastle. Fifty members have joined.
Proposed reduction in members’ subscrip-
tion to Prince Alfred Yacht Club, from two
guineas to one guinea.
“That is Oxford atone end and Cambridge
at the other.” a young lady once said to an in-
quiring friend, indicating the two batsmen at the
wickets.
By some means, we were late in receiving
Centaur’s Index, but better late than never in get-
ting the fund of information contained in the
handy little volume.
Sergeant Illingworth, one of the beat rifle
shots of Victor!*, died in South Australia, and
left a family destitute. The Ba.li.ahau Courier
is collecting subscriptions for them.
An English newspaper, which carefully
avoids saying that some of the Gentlemen funked
at a critical moment, put it gently thus:—” About
half our men were too much impressed with the
gravity of the situation.”
At Orange, the local Rifle Club defeated
the Bathurst ditto by 38 points. Mr. Campbell, of
the Bathurst team, shot splendidly, and took the
cake with a score of 58 points. Mr. Bernasconi,
with 48, scored highest for the winners.
Truth , which says that Lord Redesdale’s
Pigeon Shooting Bill doesn’t go far enough, asas
“whether the whole question would not be met
by a Rill making it an offence to slay animals for
prizes, or bet upon the chances of slaying them ?”
The Wallaroo-University match, on the
Agricultural Ground, on Saturday last, resulted
in a hollow victory for the ’Varsity. The winners
played jn grand form, in groat contrast to their
opponents, who, with the exception of Oxley,
made a miserable show.
i iThe Parramatta Rowing Club is going
ahead like a house on fire. The third annual
meeting disclosed the fact that the roll for the
present year numbers 70 members, as against 180
for the previous year. Additions to the Club shed
and fleet are contemplated.
The conspicuous failure of some of our
leading players (the Gentlemen) at the crisis showed
that, in the very essential particular of nerve, our
amateurs are.as a rule, far inferior to their colo-
nial rivals.” Thus Truth, which remarks that C.
T. Studd seems to have a regular “ at of the
funks.”
Redfern v. St. Leonards in the football
held last Saturday. Each scored a try, and Shap-
peare, for the Shore, kicked a splendid goal, which
was disallowed by the umpire, on the ground that
the ball touched the hair of one of the Kedfern
players. FactI This is splitting hairs, with a ven-
geance.
In a letter to the Melbourne Sportsman,
Donald Dinnio waxes wrath, and hints darkly
“ what he could have done ” with Miller and Victor
when be met the pair in their recent matches
Surely Dinnie does not give himsslf and the other
wrestlers away by leading the public to believe that,
the desperate struggles were “ put up ” affairs ?
Perish the thought.
More thrilling news from the morning
Rum aquatic man. On Monday he gave a glowing
account of the desperate finish between Brett and
Seale at the M.R.C. regatta, evidently not being
aware that the two are close friends, and that
Seale has as much show of besting Brett with the
sculls as the long ’un would have of landing his
active little opponent with the mittens. We always
refer to the D.T. now for our “ water tips ” be-
cause “ they know, you know.”
The continuous training and hard work
the English flyer, W. G. George, has been going in
for, nas at last told its inevitable tale, and he re-
cently suffered defeat at the hands of his old
opponent. W. Snook, who beat him, after a grand
race, by a couple of yards in the 1500 yards’ contest
for the Challenge Cup at the Birchfleld Harriers’
meeting. However, George bad his revenge on
the following Saturday, when he defeated Snook
tor the mile championship.
The Rum says ‘ there will probably be
arranged a match between Tom Clifford and Elias
Layoock,” This is thrilling intelligence, indeed.
Talking of rowing men, we wonder how Trlckett
is getting on in bis Queensland pub. ? When he
had an hotel here, gripping his flipper was like
shaking bands with a corpse in winter time. His
■welcome, too, sounded like the sentence of death.
We remember well when he had that pub. near the
Evening News. We have also a vivid recollec-
tion of his brandy,
H&ulan, like most smart men, takes a pride
in wearing a neat rig-out. an 1 he can always he
picked out from a crowd of rowing men, both
amateur and professional, from his neat and well-
fitting costume. Our amateurs might well take a
lesso” from him, for, as a rule, the whole working
wardrobe of a rowing club would not fetch enough
in an old clo r sh'>p to buy a Rum man his evening
meal; and, Heavn knows, that don’t cost much
Wo notice the Uov 1 Sydney Ya"ht Squadron
people have taken up the matter of yacht’s crews
tu ning out in next thing to rags, and for the
future the paid men, at all event?, are to show up
in uniform.
At the Belgrade Road Ground (Eng.), on
3Iat June, the twenty-miles’ professional bicycling
championship was competed for by R. Howell.
Coventry; F. Wood. Leicester: P- j. Lees, Shef-
Held; A. Hawker, Leicester; F. Bone, Sheffield.
The race requires but little description, as, save
for about a quarter of a mile, Lees remained in
tront until the last lap was reached, and took his
held along at a capital pace. When the bell rang,
however, ajnagniflcent spurt on the part of Howell
took him to the front; but a furlong* from home
Wood came up, and a desperate finish ensued,
which resulted in the victory of Howell by a foot
in Ihr Imin. 3 osec.
So far as oan be gathered from their per-
formances up to date, the best English yachts of

I ?L nd The Ctenesta was designed by Mr.
Bevor VV ebb,■ who from the days when ho raced
the grallant little Freda has made a name in the
yachting* world, and who is well qualified to turn

wich, on June 3, the Genesta finished 38sec. in
frontof tho Marjorie, and two minutes ahead of
the v anduara Great things are expected of a
now yacht, named the Irex, which is stated to
“ave tho biggest lump of lead bolted on her keel
that has ever ceen placed outside any single vessel.
J. R. Keene won a bit of a trouble when
he carriedI off the Ascot Gold Cup in 1813. with
hoxhall. The cup was taken over to America a
year ago by Mr. Keene, where It has since been in
the public stores, and the Customs authorities
have now advertised it for sale unless the duty is
paid up. Mr. Keene will have to pay the duties on
the day ot sale, and will propably send the cup
back to England. He says that if Americans can-
not afford to admit free of duty a prize won in
England by an American horse, be can afford to
b . a «?- The „9 u P was val «eB in England at
iiooo, and Keene will have to pay £350 ad valorem

Itosebery for 1800 guineas.
Sir Richard Sutton, who is just now car-
ryirJS 9F a 1 ? t ? f Prizes at home with his 80-ton
yacht, Genesta, is one of the very few sportsmen
who have savee ” enough to know when they
have had enoug h of a good thing. As Mr. Sutton,
he won all the big three-year-old events in 1888—
Derby, Two Thousand, and Leger—with Lord
ii.von, ana in the following year Lord Lyon's own
sister, the peerless Achievement, won him a heap
ot money, button merely leased this wonderful
couple tor their racing careers from the breeder,
Colonel Pearson, and they were almost his flrst
turf ventures. Directly the money ceased to roll
in, Sutton bade a long farewell to racing pursuits
and retired on his laurels and winnings. Sensible
Sutton.

The first day of the Jerilderie races broke
beautifully fine, and a good days’ sport ensued.
Wellington ran away with the Malden Plate; and
won the District immediately afterwards by half
a length from Gladiator; Verdi made a clever win
mLi he^? erilderle J °ckey Club Handicap from
Trifle; Clement won the Flying Stakes: and Miss
Windsor won the Selling Plate. Rain fell during
the second day, and the course was very heavy.
Clement won the Railway Stakes: Rob Roy the
Handicap Hurdle Race; the Ladies’ Bracelet fell
to Wellington: Blind Harper won the Selling Race;
and Verdi made a win of the Forced Handicap.
The last race was run in the dusk, and coming into
the st raight Miss Windsor fell and broke her neck.
Her jockey was not hurt.
Two fashionable sporting events have just
been decided at the other side of the water. The
champion cock of the North of Ireland was de-
feated by the boss cock of Liverpool: and, in a
rat-pit at the city named, a pitched battle between
the champion bulldogs of Liverpool and 6irming-
ham resulted in the complete defeat of the former,
which “ w s terribly punished, and would have
been killed outright had not its owner declared It
beaten, and they were then separated by force,
both being terribly mangled. The scene was re-
voiting, but was evldentlv enjoyed by those pre-
sent. The Birmingham dog tore his adversary
terribly. Anally fastening on his throat so tena-
ciously that he was with difficulty dragged off.”
The cock-tight alluded to, and a good many com-
bats of a like description, eventuated in Dublin
Bay, on board a steamer chartered for the pur-
pose.
The programme for the Sydney Rowing
Club regatta, to be held on the Parramatta River
on the 13th September, wid consist of senior
scullers in outriggers; two eight-oar races-senior
and scratch; maiden double sculls; and junior
scullers in wager boats—from whioh it will be per-
ceived no race has been left open for other clubs.
The senior clut was not above sending a man and
carrying off a trophy for an open race at the
M.R.C. regatta last Saturday, and it ilvould only be
in good taste to give their neighbours across the
way an opportunity of returning the compliment.
And, by the way, we notice the Bong Tongs are
throwing open their branch grounds for a view of
the big race next Saturday, at five bob a head.
Great Ciesar what sacrilege. It is enough to
rouse the old aristocratic clique out of their seclu-
sion, and Induce them to again take the reins of
Government.
In England, the National Cyclists’ Union
mile championship, at Lillie Bridge, only drew
together some 600 spectators—rather a contrast to
the 15,000 at our championships last Saturday week.
H. A. Speechley, C. E. Liles, and H. W, Gaskell
started for the final heat, which was finished in
the order named, in the remarkably slow time ot
drain. 30 4-5sec. The last-named cut out the run-
ning at a very slow pace, the time for the flrst
qimrtor being Imin. Isec. The same state of
affairs was maintained until about a quarter of a
I mile from home, when a grand piece of riding on
the part of Speechley landed him in front, Gaskoll
here being 15 yards behind Liles. Down the back
stretch Liles tried to get past the leader, but with-
out avail, and Gaskell, joining issue as they came
into the 8trrig*ht, a magnificent struggle was wit-
nessed, Speechley just maintaining his position
and getting home flrst by six inches; Gaskell
finished only a yard further in the rear.
At the annual contests for the English
amateur championships, held at the Lower Ground,
Aston, on 3lst June, the only noticeable perform-
ances were those of the wonder, W. G. George
and an American walker named W. H. Meek, the
former doing the mile in the unprecedented am«-
teur time ot 4rain. 18 3-5seo., and Meek winning the
seven-mile walk in 54min. 37sec. Snook, the pre-
vious holder of the Cup, started for the mile, and
made a big race of it. George dashed off with the
lea ', but only hold it for thirty yards, when Snook
passed mm and showed the way until within 550
yards ot home. Here George went up first, but
only for a short time, Snook, on climbing the hill,
regaining the lead. This he maintained until half-
way through the last lap, when George drew up
A grand race now ensued for aoout sixty yards, at
the end of which Snook was clean run out, and
George, goi ig right away, won by about eighty
yards. George s previous best was train. 19 3-5sec.
Counter attraction had, no doubt, a big say
In the rather limited attendance at Rand wick on
Saturday lost, to witness the running at Tatter-
Sabs August meeting. Vidette made an easv win

Princess of Lome won the Tramway Handicap by
some two lengths from Neplclllna, Bryan O Lynn 1
third; theS» King Kacefell to Favour; three Gulds-
boroughs finished flrst, second, and third for the
Two-year-old Stakes—Cairo, Osric, and Bon Accord
in the order named; and Battailous won the Loftus
Handicap by a couple of lengths from Bryan
O Lynn, Lord Cbfdeu third. After the last race, a
committee meeting' was held, and Leadbeater, who
had been ordered back by Mr.IGannon for dis-
I obedience to orders when on Rosinaute at the start
or the Lottos Handicap, was disqualified from
racing for six months. The sentence was a heavy
one in any case; but more especially as there were
other offenders as bad, if not worse, than the lad
on Rosinante. However, we suppose thev wished
to striae te.ror into the hearts of young Jocks
straining to get away w’th (a little bit up their I
sleeves, but it certainly seems hard lines for Lead-
beater that he should have been picked upon as
the examp e.
Lovely weather, and large attendance at
the Sydney Bicycle Club sports at the Association
cricket ground, on Saturday last. Great finishes
were looked forward to between ShakeKord and
Bennett, the Victorian and New South Wales
champions respectively, and more than a shade of
disappointment was felt when it was known Ben
nett did not intend to toe the scratch. Shakelford
did not win either of the Open Handicaps, but ho
beat record time in both, doing the two miles in
6mm 35sec., and the five miles in 17min. E. Wat-
son won the Club Mile Maiden Handicap; for the
two miles Open Handicap, Lambton (140yds.) beat
Hunt (100yds.) by some loyds., Shakelford third;
A. Edwards won the Half-mile Handicap without
handles from scratch; A. Wood (20yds.) carried off
thelOOyds. toot race; F. H. Pearson (40yds.) won
the Boys’ Handicap, i he One-mile Club Cham-
pionship was carried off by J. M. Ferguson, after a
well-ridden race, in 3min. SOsec.; Remshard (300
yds.) won the Five-mile Open Handicap, Shakel-
ford, with a grand rush, finishing only ten yards in
his rear; A. W. Crane won the 109yds. slow race;
G. Reid (820yds.) won the Boys’ Quarter-mile Tri-
$J’,Vle^ Iandicap ! and A * Wood (300yds.) won the
Mile Club Tricycle Handicap.
Here is a story of two well-known English
ready-money bookmakers, Alf Savillo and Bob
Topping, which ended in the utter defeat of
Saville:—The stewards of Ascot were especially
strict in prohibiting devices on the part of the
ready-money men to attract custom. Red, white,
and blue hats, white coats with scarlet crosses,
evening dress, barristers’ wigs and gowns, and
bishop’s aprons and shovel hats especially attract-
ing the wrath of the authorities. They would
allow nothing outre in any way whatever. Hew-
lett, the Newmarket shaver, who takes up his
Quarters at the hotel for a week, would not con-
descend to shave ready-money bookmakers, and
would not go lower than those who bet on the
nod. Saville sadly needed shaving, and, his
hand not being very steady one morning. Bob
Topping assumed the functions of barber. Either
the razor was a bad one, or Bob’s hand had lost its
cunning; anyway, he cut and hacked Savilie’s face
about in such a manner that after the operation
his mother woulr’ not have known him. A.nd,
afterwards, when he began to shout “Sa to four
on the field! ” the Jockey Club came and looked at
his tape. This,” they said, “is clearly a device.”

At the invitation of Edward Hanlan’s
Fidus Achates, Mr T. M. Alcock, the well-known
Haymark t Jeweller, we Journeyed up the Parra-
matta River on Friday last in “Captain” Mat.
Burns launch Annie, to witness an exhibition of
rowing by the champion. And this is another point
m which Hanlan differs from the rest of the pro.
Hitherto, it has been the custom for professionals
to make a ridiculous fuss about showing their
true form to the general public, but Hanlan never
grudges an exhibition of his powers on what ap-
pears to be his “native elephant,” as Mrs. Par-
tington would put it. tlnon the arrival of the
steamer at the Mercantile R.C. Branch, the party',
which included several ladles, went on shore, when
Hanlan proved himself as accomplished in the
arrangement of wild flowers as in the management
of his shell. The champion is a sad dog amongst
the ladies, and we think It only fair to inform his
many admirers that he left a little wife and large
family behind him when he left the States. Elias
Laycpck showed up during the afternoon, and
obligingly did some spurts with the champion
Hanlan, who looked in perfect health, fairly
bubbles over with animal spirits when on the
water, and to his cheery “Now, boys, who’s fora
100 yards spin?” Laycock, Brett, and Ed wards drew
u p level, ana the four dashed away. Laycock got
all the worst of the start, but he held his own with
the champion, and showed that he has lost none of
the dash for a spurt for which he was ever
noted. Hanlan performed the most perfect bit of
rowing It has been our lot to witness, albeit his
style of finishing with such a powerful swish
would be considered “ wrong to blazes ” in the
aquatic school where we received our education
I be scullers accompanied the steamer as far as the
bridge, when a cheery good-bye was exchanged,
and the Annie landed her pa c sougers at the Quay
iQjrood time, all thoroughly pleased with the
exhibition.
Wallace Ross unloaded himself thusly with
regard to the recent Courtney fizzle:—" He wanted
me to let him win the race. I heard that he was
going to leave for homo if I persisted in boating
him, so I did not give him a decided answer.”
Did he make any financial offer?” “Oh, no*
nothin# of that kind,” said Koss, hesitatingly!
, , ol L ( -! on ’ t mean to say that he asked you to #ive
him $1500, do you?” ‘‘Well, I was to have the
prize,’ said Ross. “ He wanted you to throw the
rac® mto his hands in consideration of your getting
the $-500 ? “Just so.” Subsequently, Courtney
gave the reporter his view of what, had occurred,
and handed to that gentleman a mysteriou-letter
from a mysterious person signing himself “Jim.”
Courtney asserted that the purse of $3500 offered
by Pilkington and Nagle was purely mythical, and
that no money had been really put up in the hands
of a stakeholder. The stakeholder. Richard K.
box, was very indignant over the affair, and said
that, Courtney had done him great injustice by
saying that no money had been deposited. “ Not
only was the $3500 put in my hands,” said Fox
but Courtney was present at the time, with Ross
and Plaisted. To-day I paid $3000 to Ross as
the winner of the race, for he was ordered to pull
oyer the course by the referee. The $500 which
the articles stipulated should go to the loser of the
race I paid back to Pilkington and Nagle. I sup-
Courtney will sue me in the courts for this
$o00, but I would not pay it to him under any cir-
cumstances, as he ran away. To my mind, therels
no reason for the fizzle, except that he was afraid
of Ross, and had not enough heart to meet him.”
The trouble with Courtiey,” said Ross, “was
that he tried to get mo to let him win the race,
and failed. He said that if I would lot him win
this race he would have another race at Saratoga
Lake, which he would let me win. He had a young
friend at Union Springs who was recently married,
and who had $15,000. Courtney proposed that he
should get his friend to bet the $15,000 on him, and
tha.t wo should sco jp the money between us.”
Next Saturday will be a red-letter day in
the aquatic history of Australia, and whichever
way the judge gives his yerdict, there is a comfort
interning sure the race will be rowed on its merits,
and each man will do his level best to lower the
colours ef his opponent. Beach has many ad-
mirer?, and amongst them men who ought to
know a thing or two in the rowing line, but, as
Hanlan rows in better form than his opponent,
and has an unbroken list of wins against the best
men in the world, as against Beach’s alleged
wonderful time trials, we think Hanlan has all the
best of it on paper; and, so far as betting in con-
cerned, we fancy it is about a bob to a Nooze
ma-i s lunch-money on the Canadian, and that is
long odds with a vengeance. All the principal pro-
fessionals and amateurs have been disportinv
themselves on the River during the week, Hanlan
and Beach, ot course, proving the greatest attrac-
tioa. that Beach is rowing in grand form there
can be no two opinions, but. alongside Hanlan, he
dots not appear to ca r cti such a square grip of the
water, and locks stiff about the shoulders, the
latter no doubt caused by the immense amount of
muscle carried by him in that quarter. Beach is a
mass of huge muscles, but it is a great question
if a man cannot be too muscular, that is,
, of course, in museks not brought into requisition
in a boat, us such a state is calculated to bind a
♦a.of a , rid i u . du , ce him to try and use muscles
that shou d not be brought too much into play, as
in the arms, for instance. Hanlan appears to have
been modelled specially for a boat-puller, having
no superabundant muscles, ©xooptaboutthe loin*
wnere he is a picture of symmetry and strength.
The Champion tried his new craft, built by Don
nelly, °n Sunday afternoon, and appeared iho.

mould as Beach’s craft, and up to the time of our
k°Iu n° P ress there appeared every probability of
both Hanlan and Beach pulling in the brats built
tor them t.y Donnelly. Should they decide to do
so on Saturday next, it will indeed be a leather in

forged ahead of the plucky little horse, and won,
cranks down, by two passenger carriages and a
sheep truck. Time, 30 min. The settling up took
place at the Shepparton Temple of Justice a few
days afterwards. Police Magistrate Akehurst boss-
ing the situation, when the playful Anderson had
to taco the music on a charge of cruelty to a
Constable M'Conville swore a mighty great
oath that the horse, at the finish ot the race, “ was
completely baked, and in a terrible lather ov
sweat; but the baste ov an ingin hadn’t turned a
nair. The loco, jock gave corroborative evidence,
adding that the engine was pretty warm when it
caught the judge's eye, but under kind treatment
was able to resume the journey to Melbourne,
l hen a couple of sportive publicans and a groom
swore that Anderson’s horse was a regular flyer,
and it was simply recreative exercise for the
animal to have a six-mile breather, though he did
look as it he had been hard ridden Anderson
denied that ho had any money on the race, and
said that he had an important engagement to
meet, hence the hurry. So Mr. Akehurst compli-
mented Mr. Anderson on his desire for punc-
tuality, and at the same time fined him £1 with £1
is. costs. And the Sheppartonians are now won-
dermg whether they live under free and demo-
cratic Institutions, or are being ground down by a
tyrannical and despotic Government.
The career of James alias “Yankee”
Sullivan, whose real name was Frank A. Murray
and whose cognomen will bo handed down to
terlty In the annals of the P.R., Is one well worthy
of an outline, more especially as he was intimately
acquainted with Australia'. “ Yankee ” at an early
age evinced a liking for the noble art, and after
several battles lor the mere love of the thing, he
met m Ireland and whipped a man named Brady
for a sum of money. He then betook himself to
.Liverpool, ling., where he was arrested for bur-
glary, and ’ settled” for fourteen years in this
great and glorious land. As many of our old-
time readers are no doubt aware, it was customary
tor land-owners to farm out the convicts by pay-
ing the Government a stipend therefor, and a cer-
tain large tract-owner, among others, hired Sulii-
van as a farm-hand. Other land-owners hired
others pugilistioally inclined, and it was no uncom-
mon thing for these sports to get up a pitched
battle between two of this class. As such. Sulli-
van, under the sobriquet of “ Ginger.” fought
and defeated Steward in 3h. 8m. • Dick
Tramor in 73 rounds, Hi. 45m.; John White in 13
rounds, 40m ; and Georgo Snarples alias Bumbles
in-, rounds, Ih. 5m Bumbles, christened so on
account of his cloven foot, was a hard customer
to dispose of, and Sullivan used to say: “Ned, it
would have done your heart good to have been
hit by Bumbles.” Yankee Sullivan made his es-
cape from Sydney, on tne ship Citizen, Captain
Lansing, to New Zealand. From there he went to
, a 5 Harbour, Loug Island. This was in the year
mt, when Murray was about 26 years old. Of
this escape a pretty tough story was told by Joe
Winrow. In those desperate times the prison
authorities, instead of searching vessels leaving
these ports, used to bore for the stowaways
through the deck with immense augers. They
are said to have bored for “Ginger” and his pal
Jim Maguire, and when the point touched
Maguire s leg “ Ginger,” with a drawn bowie-knife,
threatened to cut his head off if by any noise he
gave them away. Winrow said that the auger was
sent clean through Maguire’s leg, and added
further that the wounded man coolly wiped off
the blood from the auger with his handkerchief,
and sq they managed to get off undiscovered. On
escaping, he adopted the name of James Sullivan.
After fighting some battles in America he went
back to England, into the very jaws of the Lion,
and in 1841 he fought his first, big battle, and del
foated Lane in 34 minutes. We will conclude with
rather au unpleasant little episode which occurred
alter Mr. Sullivan’s return to America: While
very much intoxicated, he quarrelled with his wife,
who was also addicted to drink, and during his as-
sault upon her while in bed a lamp was upset, the
poor woman’s clothes caught fire, and she was
burned so badly that she died the next day.
Sullivan was arrested for murder, but the case
never came to trial, owing to the political influence
wielded by Sullivan.
On Saturday morning those who ought to
know, yon know, prophesied s heavy westerly in
*!j® a »* ternob H t tb e fat08 were propitious, and
the Mercantile Ro ving Club had an afternoon to
be remembered for their inaugural i-egatta on the
larramatta River. The arrangements generally
were ell carried out by the executive, but the
races were of a very uninteresting nature so far
as close finishes were concerned, the winners in
every instance coming in victors with ridiculous
ease-unless the senior sculls in skiffs may be
taken as an exception, but in t mt event it was
very evident Seale *as O’ ly allowed, on suffer-
ance, to make such a close finish of it. There was
only one oar race on the programme, a rather
peculiar fact considering that only a few Satur-
of the M.R.C. stated that one
of the chief advantages of the River Branch w uld
be ti e facilities for oar practice in light craft. The
oar race was one forjunior-seniors-save the mark
—and t the tor 'shown was any criterion of the
generai run of M.tt.C. junior-seniors, in the name
ot thunder Jet them give us a scratch race for
maideus at the next snow—wo would then know
what to exnect. The ball opened with the maiden
double sculls, which fell an easy orey to W. Knight
and G M. Summerfleld: rnra then tee Admiral
steamed up to the head of tho champion course to
: m° 1 °'? 1 th ?. s ? nJor8 J a ' ; utriggers, for which J. O.
Trimble, F Ives, G. J. Robertson, ai d F. J Bull
started. Trimble completely outclassed his op-
ponents, and paddled over the course theeasiest of
winners, Ives finishing second after rowing a
<■ lucky but hopeless rac . Brett. Seale, and Wil-
liams started tor the set ior sculls. Sa-ile went
away with the lead, while Hr tt contented
himseL with second p*ace. and WiMams brought
rea £ m *be wake of Brett’s wash.
Brett then drew up and showed that he huu
the race in hand whenever he liked to extend him-
seif, for with a few powerful s’rokes he led past
the point with a clear length lead. The New South
te^ 8^ obatn J? io 2,? he 5 L f ? u baok a * aiQ . but he came
later on and obliged tho spectators with a seem-
*a?iy close finish, boating Seale on the post by
a Jen /tb. Seale pulled a good race, but the
calibre of his opponent was too much for him
Representatives from the M.R.C., 8.K.C., G.R.C.!


M a r r and B.R.C. started for the maiden single !
ills in’skiffs, open to all clubs. Shortly after the I
t Connolly tried to take a short cut overland, j
the idea didn’t seem to gee, and Kennedy, of
. h« sHC, pulling in fine form, went clean away
*vnna his field, and won as he liked. Kennedy is
makings of a good sculler, and we feel pretty
a.ire we shall hear of him at bigger game than
races. Pickering, who by this time should
have rowed his way up a little higher than a
“maiden,” rowed in very poor form, as did Fraser
of the Balmains. Only two crews started for the
uiiiinr-senior fours, which proved an easy victory
for Grace, Warro, Blackstone, and Brindley. The
stroke of the losing crew caught crabs out of
number and rowed a scratchy dip in and out of
the water not worthy to be called a stroke. How
in the name of wonder such an oarsman could be
nicked to stroke a crew, is beyond us. The best
rice of the day was between tne Admiral and the
prince of Wales on the road home. The Prince
Jrotaway with the start, but the Admiral had all
the best of it to the Quay, where she landed her
passengers in good time, all seemingly satisfied
with their afternoon’s entertainment.
( Thus “Penclragon” in the Referee:—
“ However the balance may be when tee Austra-
lian cricketers come to the end of their present
list of fixtures—whether their success is as great
as they themselves thought it was h mnd to be,
or whether the run of luck is dead against them—
they will carry away when they depart the admi-
ration of everybody who likes to see men exhibit
courage and determination; to exhibit them at
times when courage a> d determin tion are most
valuable, and, therefore, are rarest. It is an
axioiwamong Eng.ish athletes that the absolaL ly
bravest man known is the man who can display
his bravery at tho exact moment when the display
is of the highest possible value. This axiom is the
result of experiences, many of which will not bear
thinking about when desperate valour in the field
becomes the subject of conversation. During
their stay here, the Australians have played several
games under exceptionally disadvantageous cir-
cumstances; sometimes their best men have been
cripple*, at others, fortune has declared very de-
cidedly against them: but whether they have won
or whether they have lost, nobody can deny that
they did their level best, and we have it on
fairly high authority that no man can do more.
Anyone who reads the reports of the match played
at the beginning of the current week must be
struck with the dogged pei-tmaeity of the ‘ corn-
stalk ’ lot: when what they did then is added on to
what they have done before—and I don’t refer
particularly to matches that have been won by
them—w« must at once concede them the merit ot
that dogged obtsinacy which was once regarded as
the private and peculiar property of natives of
these islands. One or twice I have had to say
something which may have appeared unkind in
regard to the assumption of amateur rank by the
Australians. I sincerely wish they were better
qualified as amateurs, if only because their pluck
and staying power would do much to loaven the
weak-kneed business which here in England often
gives professionals so great an advantage- Any-
how, 1 am glad to a, mir nerit wh merer and
wherever I get an opportunity. The calm and
quiet way in which tho Australians have played
up is a powerful rebuke to these who are not only
so anxious to decry them, but so ready to ‘give
reasons ’ directly a home Pam is beaten’by them.”
The London Dailt Telegraph says that “al-
though every true-born Briton will regard the
victory of the redoubtable Austra'ian Eleven,
captained by Mr. Murdoch, over the Gentlemen of
England, with genuine regret, there will not be
the shadow of bitterness mingled with the feeling.
On the contrary, the JV other Country looks with
pride on a flourishing colour which is capable of
producing a body of cricketing athletes able to
match themselves equally, and sometimes even
victoriously, against the best p'ayors which she-
herself can find to represent her. . . There are
thousands to whom the name of Australia was as
that of an unknown wiidierness until her first team
cams to show us a sample of tho fyone and muscle.
which was capable of being produced out there.
Hundreds of our countrymen will find It much
easier to imagine what life at Melbourne and
Sydney means after watching Blackham wicket-
keeping or Spofforth bowling for an afternoon. It
would not even be surprising if the result were
that more of our young men decided to take to
Colonial life, and if Mr. Murdoch in that way be-
came a valuable adjunct to tho emigration offices.”
After this, surely no Australian Cabinet Minister
can possibly refuse a Civil servant leave of absence
to go to England with an eleven. The D.T. further
says that the Australians’ victory over the Gentle-
men at their second meeting was won by “ sheer
indomitable resolution and boundless courage,”
and that “ nobody can grudge them a victory won
by the display of admirable skill, and still more by
the quality of never recognising that they are or
ought to be defeated.” Many other papers are
equally tiattei’ing to our men, who. however, are
this time apparf ntly regarded by all ha r ds as out-
and out professionals. The Standard first started
depriving Murdoch and his friends of their “ Mr.”
in its match-reports; a lot of the other papers fol-
lowed suit, and now we find that while the “ Mr.”
is appended in every case to the names of Steel,
O'Brien, and so on, it is almost invariably omitted
in the case of the Australians, between whom no
distinction is made. The sole exception is the
Times. It is, indeed, intensely comical to find
that most respectable paper saying that “ Mr.
i annerraan” was here neatly caught by “Mr.”
O’Brien, and that “Mr Midwinter sent a ball to
the off for four. Which reminds one that the
other day. in reporting a match between the
“ Gentlemen of Philadelphia ” and an English
team, the snobbish Globe actually printed “ Esq.”
at the end of each Yankee “ge’mman's” monni-
ker. In America, as in Australia, we suppose,
every tripe-dresser's assistant thinks himself an
Esquire. There is onlv one other title which has
been so deeply degraded in Australia—and that is
“Knight.” Home days since, a provincial paper
remarked that “ this time tho Australian team
played so evenly that it hardly seemed to have a
tail.” “Goodgraciousl” shriekedBlackham; “the
noble Horsetrailyan kangaroo without a tail I Look
here, my boy, you have yet to learn that the tall is
the strongest part of the animal—and don’t you
forget It.”
The two sides to an all-engrossius; subject
in the South at the present time are truant officers
and monthly nurses. The strife Is great between
them. Our sympathies are with the latter. In a
young country like ours a rapidly increasing
population is our main thing; and. as well as we
can judge, the latter have a decided advantage
over the former in conducing to this result. It
may be denied that the party of our choice in pro-
pria persona, contributes directly to this grand
Issue, as the nurses are mostly well up in years.
But the same denial can be urged against the
truant officers. All anyone with a capacity for
diagonosing a stud man has to do is to watch one
of these officers giving his evidence in court. You
see that all his virility has taken the direction of
lying* It is not, then, for what they are capable
of in propria peruana, but for their coadjutorial
efficiency that, after comparing them, we have
elected to side with the nurses in the present dis-
pute. The dispute lies here. A monthly nurse
goes forth on her heavenly mission. The truant
officer hears of it, and lays himself out to watch
those kids she leaves at home. He always finds
that Tommy goes down to the river and fishes all
day, instead of going to school. Therefore, bo
summons the t- urse. But he has next to pick his
magistrate. He, therefore, prowls around, and
gets a bachelor to sit on tho case. And tie bache-
lor magistrate sacs to the monthly nurse, “ v on
ought to beat home with your children. As for
what you say about being a monthly nurse. I be-
lieve you want to Impose on the Court. There's
no such business.” Now, this is mean on tho part
of the truant officers, and we hope that, out of the
Investigation going on, the monthlies will come
triumphant.

SOCIAL
Last Thursday, a private social, initiated
by members of the Emulation Lodge, was held In
the Town Hall vestibule, and it passed off with all
the cheerful pleasure that can be got from youth,
beautv, and brightness Everyone, by this time,
knows the splendid hall, with its wonderful roof,
its matted corridors, and noble chandelier, and,
with Herman and Shapter's music, and all the
elegance of Baumann’s genius visible on the
supper tables, nothing, was wanting more, it is
true there wa< rain outside, buttaere was a reign
of beauty within that soon elev ated the thoughts
above paltry weather- The Lodge is a young one,
and most of its guests wore young, too. mere
was none of the tormality of wearing aprons, tor
the reason that the atfair was not intended to be a
d'splay of Masonry, but just an indulgence in the
pleasantest of social pastimes, and the members
trust to have some similar occasion once every
three months. From the very agreeable style of
their first social, there is no doubt others will be
eagerly looked for, though they will not neces-
sarily be always in the form of an evening
dance. A committee of seven managed matters,
and at eight o’clock sharp a programme of
30 dances was commenced, waltzes the chief. Of
course, the prevailing mania for turning every
other dance Into a waltz had some adhere its; and
t ic Kensington style was adopted by a tew of the
couples. It is a style that could hardly bo done by
oad dancers, as tbe partners hold so lightly, and
those who did it were among tbe best in the room.
A little Moore Park lady, with straight err am
s<irts, was Hath-r-light ; and so was a Bourke-
«»reet favourite in white, decked with tawny no-
bons. Ve~y graceful was a quiet girl i sky blue,
with white lac i trimming. A dress that many
ladies envied was a pale blue silk, trimmed with
tine white lace and blush roses, worn by a Cleve-
land-street lady. With a married lady Irom
Oxford-street, came a charming girl in small ruby
velvet bodice and airy white skirt, wh so happy
smiles were enough to make anyone else happy
—who got one. A bttle lady, popular on the stage,
treated her partners to an incessant How of
sprightly talk; and if there's one being in t bal-
rcotn tha’ a young man loves with unlimiied
affection, it a tuc girl who car i.old up one end of
a conve sntion. and do it as nicely as he pretty
little wearer of those white, llighty-looki..g skirts
and cardinal trimmings did. When the Emulation
Private Social ended, about 1 o’clock, uli agreed
that it had been thoroughly enjoyed.
* ♦ ♦
St. Aloyslus’ College sports occurred on
the 8th August, when big and little boys, gaily
bedight, struggled In the athletic arena under the
eye c of relatives and friends, who nearly half-filled
the stand. They were earnest enough, and if the
championship of the federated colonies had at-
tached to every race, they could not have made
greater efforts, or much more noise. Most of the
athletes were Milesian young gentlemen, and they
ran about and shouted with all that Impulsiveness
of manner supposed to be characteristic of their
nation. The big boys generally beat the little
ones, who did not get halt eno gh handicaps—so
their mothers persisted. Quite a number of Rev.
Fathers were present; and so was Tom Malone, the
champion runner. B. Henry won the cham-
pion schools’ race; C. Olllffo, the half-mile; and
little A. Jennings was greeted with roars of
laughter as he shuffled in winner of thesack strug-
gle. Remshard won the il mile bicycle race. Hamil-
ton was not able to get up at the finish, but no doubt
soon forgot his defeat in the sweet consolation
he seemed to enjoy on the lawn. The Nelson band
played, and as most of the attendance consisted of
what Mr. Dan O’Connor calls the sweet solaces of
men’s lives, wo will just describe woat their fathers
and husbands have to pay for. Two young ladies
displayed a liking for plenty of colour, one wear-
ing a deep sea blue with white lace down the
breast; and the other, brown velvet with chenille
trimming and cashmere, also fronted with white
lace. A pepper-grey cloth was trimmed with
ailver-grey silk, hat and feather well matching. A
lake cashmere was formed in three rows of square
pleats, and the body gathered in folds at the waist,
Henri Deux of same colour. One of the most fas-
cinating little specimens of roundness was a figure
In peacock green, the neat bodice having figured
silk jabot, and the accordion skirt entirely free
from draping, hut with half-a-dozen itucks below,
running through the pleats, which were full
length; velvet hat and feather of green com-
pleted one of those ensnaring toilettes that de-
cimate the ranks of the noble army of bache-
lors. Another of the svme colour was a cloth
skirt and brocaded velvet bodice of consider-
able magnificence. A full blue had the cuffs,
Swiss belt, draping, and hem all marked with nar-
row black lines. A very finely pleated Mary An-
derson was of brownish green mixture, with deep
band of black, and above was a fresh, bright face.
Perhaps the most stylish dress on the promenade
was a fine black satio, with front drapery and
golden satin jabot, worn by a orunette; gloves and
parasol en mite, and princess bonnet also set off
with gold satin. That particular development of
form which is now so highly approved by the
female world was carried to an exirome in a dress
of rye-brown cloth: for while the small pointed
bodice clung to the figure as close as ciicumstanoes
allowed, the skirt, m a spirit of antagonism, stood
out like a huge diving-bell. About three limes
round this extensive young lady would have made
a good race for small buys. One simple dress
caught the eye—all black, apparently merino, in
broad pleats beaded by draped paniers: bonnet,
parasol, and gloves all black, and only the dainty
collar and cuffs white: and the co;tume bespoke
the wearer’s pe feet taste.
* ♦ *
Wiloannia people held their monthly win-
ter party on Thors lay, tbe rlst ult. Abouttwenty
couple gathered at Kennedy's Assembly Hall at W,
and enjoyed themselves heartily until « iu ihe
morning, getting through a well-arranged pro-
gramme ot 33 oanc s. Among the -carried ladles,
a brunette in whii.n satin, who is wife of a Silver-
ton auctioneer, and a dark lady, who is a splendid
dancer, wife of a local auctioneer, were particu-
larly admired. The great attraction among the
single ladies waa an heiress, at present on a visit to
the town, resplendent in black and wbito saiin;
and, no doubt, numbers of the Wilcannia young
bachelors were ready to say ‘‘Cannia,’ if she
would have said “ Wil.” Thu music- was all that
could be desired, and supper quite good enough
for people who love dancing.
♦ * •
A glorious moon, at its golden full rose
over the pretty town of Riehmojd, as the girls
began to dress 'or the Masonic Ball. Tney re-
quired a deal of time, for it was an event that had
fiutteied half the muslin on the Hawkesbury for
weeks beforehand. The lact, is, the Richmond
gills haven’t been a freely of la : e, and
the parsons are making hardly any extra fees, so
the Duke of Connaught Lodge determined to give
them a chance, and came to the rescue with a ball.
When the night came, it brought visitors from
naar an i far, and as they arrived at the School of
Arts a crowd watctu d esgerly outside, and even-
tually squeezed in, to get a sight of the gaiety and
glitter on the important occasion. Everything
had been prepar d with cate; programmes were
b ue and silver, in the form of a Masonic apron,
bearing all the mystic symbols of the craft; the
floor was not only clean, but so s ippery that solt
thuds, followed by the removal of limp masses
of lovelines from the centre of traffic, were fre-
quent incidents Tbe musl ■ was managed by a
oisciple of Orphei s bearing the iuqodng name
of Francisco Melfl, who had tareo assistants, who
played with a cheerful celerity that made the
dancing warm work. Most of the Richmond
young men have a style of dancing that is honest,
but angular: they waltz on the Scriptural principle
that It Is more blessed to give than to receive, and I
generally manage to bestow quite as many prods
as they get. To make sure of this, they cultivate
a habit of keeping their left elbow always out at
the angle which is most convenient for raking the
ribs ot anyone who comes near it. However,
other people do this, too; ami, for the benefit,
therefore, of Richmond and the other quarters of
the globe, we respectfully make this one appeal:
Do keep your elbow down. But there was plenty
of room, and of good-humour, so the ball was
really enjoyed in spite of the e'bows. Mr. H.
Evans was a capital master of ceremonies, and
very courteous. Ai each dance the couples were
marched round, so that everyone should get an
equal start. As this was a new plan, it took
us a little while to get into it. We'd be
superintending the loading of some Peri’s plate
with quivering jelly, and talking innocently about
the weather, when a special messenger would
hurry up to say “ There’s a young lady asking for
you, mister.” Then we would hasten off, full of
agitation, wondering what had happened, only to
discover that the procession was waiting, and the
music couldn't start till we and our young lady
joined in. We’d remember the arrangement tor
an hour or so, and then forget it again. Wander-
ing out under the chaste light of the glorious
moon, we’d commence on a prime cigar, listening
the while for the preliminary chords of the galop,
when another small boy appeared, to announce
again, “Your young lady’s waiting, mister; she's
got on a crushed strawberry.” Of course, we at
once snipped off to tho young ady who had *“got
on” the crushed strawberry, and tried to mollify
her by a series of servile apologies; but this
march round business seemed to weign us down
with responsibility and care. We couldn’t take
a rest or a reverie, or even go off with
a committeeman to see whether the supply
of soda-water still held out, but we were haunted
with the apprehension that everyone who ap-
proached came to say “ There’s a young lady wait-
ing.” The decorations were something for Rich-
mond ladles to be proud of, for to their deft fingers
was due the wonderfully pretty effect of the
festoons that dangled from roof and wall, of woven
ti-tree studded with flowers-of the fresh ger-
aniums—the leafy bowers in every corner—and the
Masonic emblems of every kind which were in-
geniously designed out ot cut fern-fronds and
palm leaves. The whole was planned by Mr. C.
Chester, ot the Bank of N.S.W., and carried out
by a ladies’committee of Mesdames Guest, Hughes,
Misses Griffin, Hughes, and Holmes. The other
members of the ball committee were the W.M.,
C. 8. Guest; P.M.’s Dr. Jockel, G. H. Flannery;
M.M.'s C. Doyle, 8. Boughton, and E. Young.
The ball was opened by Mr. Guest and Mrs.
Flannery vin-d-vin to Mr. Hillier and Mrs. Guest
who wore a handsome black costume set off
with cardinal flowers, and the dancers soon
got on good terms with one another. Mr. T. R.
Smith, the local member, was, as usual, among the
most active on the floor. Colonel Holborow dis-
played a special taste for dancing with the pretty
little daughter of his vigorous colleague; and Miss
Smith, neat in cream satin, was certainly a delight-
ful partner. Mrs. Smith was present from Penrith
in a handsome dark sttin. Dr. Hughes was also
there, and Mrs. Hughes, charming in ivory corded
siln and deep ruby flowers. Mr. Chester wore ar-
tillery uniform. Miss Cobcroft, a tall and hand-
some girl from Riverstone, was a Lady ot rhe 17th
Century, in Marie Stuart bonnet and a flowing
robe, which was green from the back, red bordered
wlrh gold in front, particularly symmetrical from
a side aspect, and charming from any point. Her
sister-in-law, Mrs. Cobcroit, wore a capital make-
up as Bettina, the good-luck bringer in “ La Mas-
cotte,” and very good-lucking she was in her flop
hat and curls over a piquant face. Of the Rich-
mond girls, it seemed to us that none danced so
well as Miss Johnson, who wore neat pink satin;
and none had a finer dress than Miss Holmes, who
sparkled in short hair and a pleated eau de Nile
satin, adorned with blush roses, white lilies and
water-grass. A bevy of local charms was repre-
sented by her sister, in blue; Miss Ellen Bather, in
Nancy Lee dresj with a very slender waist; Miss
Griffin, in a dark toilet; Miss Young, in two shades
of raspberry-red broche and veiling, blended in a
way very attractive; Mrs. Reid, from the Post-
office, handsome in a black grenadine woven with
5 old threads and golden satin bodice; and Mrs.
ockel, in a costume ot good taste—black with pale
blue gloves and girdle. Bright little Miss Mary
Hughes, who teaches the young idea how to shoot
in the school close by, wore a sweet cream satin,
with red-edged flounces and ribbons, and
Just our solid prose to vary
For a time,
We will picture little Mary
In a rhyme.
Little thing who’d make you dreamy,
Fill your head
Full of thoughts of satin creamy,
Ribbons red.
Very fond of fun and dancing,
We should say;
Face 98 bright as sunlight glancing
At raid-day.
Sort of girl who’d lead you on to
Spend your cash—
Girl who makes you madly want to
Do a mash. t
All was joy while with her flitting
Round the room:
Seeing others by her sitting.
That was gloom I
The beautiful Kurrsjong district was represented
by Miss Dunstan, a blonde whose fine figure was
set off '»y paie-bluesilk; and North Richmond by a
petite brunette from the Public School, Mrs. Doyle,
who looked charming in a satin of ironbark brown.
Miss Ada Doyle was a saucy siren from Surry Hills
in crushed strawberry and ivy leaves, with a rose
mounted on one side of a coquettish head. From
Balmain came Miss Schofield us Duchess of Devon-
shire; from Moore Park. Miss Hamilton in pink
silk most beautifully handpalnted; from Cockatoo,
Miss Hayes in ruby and pink; and from Woolloo-
mooloo, Miss Jessie Evans in white satin and net—
a toilette that looked exquisitely pretty. Mrs.
M'Grath, from Parramatta, also wore white—
a trained satin that looked exceedingly hand-
some; and Miss Drew, of Windsor, drew lots of
admirers, as one of the prettiest little dancers in
tne room, her dainty figure shown to advantage in
a white silk. Miss Seath, of Windsor, wore black
net, covered with tiny flowers; Miss Cummings, a
graceful young lady of Petersham, wore cardinal
flowers on a white faille, which did not fail to
charm. Other ladies looked web, but wo can t call
to mind the precise details that made them fasci-
nating. As to the belle, we are perfectly silent.
Call us coward, if you like. Don’t matter; we
shan’t say a word. We are leaving that particular
conundrum to Messrs. Davies and Johnson, the
editorial luminaii s who scintillate in the journa-
listic sphei’e of the Hawkesbury, and we have
Treat confidence they will find an answer to please
everyone Mr. Phil. Miles, of Richmond, was
caterer, and provided in a way th-n was a credit to
himself and the town, and on the strength of his
luscious tables dancing was kept up till nearly five
o’clock on the balmy Saturday morn.

RinkLng was very popular in Sydney a few
years ago, but, after a rage ot about three sea-
sons, it declined, and now the rumble of the
wneels is seldom heard. We believe its decadence
was. in part, owing to the enormous price askeo
for skates, and even then often tor a very ill-made
article. People grew more tired of the constant
expi nse than ot the exercise. It has been stigma-
tised as a foolish occupation, and perhaps it is, but
so are lots of other exercises and pastimes, and
people must do something for recreation. As the
I rinking mania wore off in Sydney, it began to
seize upon the country towns, many having rinks
superior to any in the metropolis. But. this sea-
son, owing to the splendid hall available in Pad-
dington—St. Matthias' school-hall—it is revived
again, and every Monday night the private club is
attended by a number of enthusiastic ladies
and gentlemen—some extremely graceful skaters.
Cuilousiy enough, though it is about seven
years since rinki g was popular in England,
and half London as well as other towns went
roller mad, it is only this past season that the craze
has developed seriously in New York. One rink
there last year took the enormous sum of £11,COO;
it accommodates 3000 skaters. Teacbersare reap-
ing golden harvests, for everyone wants to be
taught at once, and can’t afford to wait for fear
they will be regarded as behind the fashion. Car-
nivals are held on elaborate scale, and prizes given
for speed, for fancy work, and for tableaux. Kink-
ing is very funny, and it’s most particularly funny
when you can’t do it. It is a perfect comedy if
you know just enough to keep on your feet, and
it verges on tragedy when you don’t And yet
there is a charm about it somewhere. People fad
down, and hurt their limbs and their dignity, with
unstinted enthusiasm for several months before
they become expert. Then, after infinite trouble
in learning, the art dies out The Woollahra
people do not like to see trouble wilfully wasted
in this way, and have consequently resuscitated
the lively pastime in St. Matthias’ Hall.

Last month, quite an era in the festive an-
nals of Fiji was marked by an amateur-perform-
ance of ‘‘The Pirates of Penzance." It was ad-
mitted to have been in all waysasplendld perform-
ance, which would have been creditable to far older
colonies. It took place in the public schoolroom
at Suva, under the management of Mr..George
Moore, the scenery and mounting beiogjjeauti-
fully prepared by Mr. Chabot. The character of
the opera was that of Mabel, taken by Mrt. Farr,
whose sweet, flexible soprano voice, and correct
rendering, delighted the critics in the audience,
and her graceful acting was full of charm.
Kuth was a tine impersonation by Miss IS vans,
though her voice was none too strong; and the
same limit of power was the only fault that could
be found with Mr. Collet as the Pirate King, for
both parts were most carefully and correctly
acted. Major-General Stanley was taken by Mr.,
George Moore, whose wife was pianiste during the
evening. The large audience testified that the
opera was the finest entertainment yet seen at
Suva.

A nice wedding took place at the residence
of Mr. Gulliver, Darby-street, Newcastle, on the
Vth inst., when Miss Lucy E. Suter and Mr. A.
M’Pherson were united. The bride was elegantly
dressed in cream silk and Spanish lace; and five
bridesmaids attended, one in cream and cardinal,
two in blue, and two in pink. When the company
adjourned to breakfast, provided by Lashmore.
various healths were proposed, as usual, and at 8
in the evening the guests started dancing. The
hall appeared prettily decorated, and the gay
dresses deserving of notice. Tne wife of a leading
citizen wore a handsome costume of ruby velvet,
trimmed with cream silk, oriental Lee, add head-
dress to match. The hostess wore a rich black
satin and real laco. A dark young lady from Surry
Hills wore cream veiling and cardinal surah, with
cream bretnn lace; and a married lady from Wick-
ham wore a pretty cream biocbe satin. Two
sisters came from Bruoe-street la light materials,
which looked very pretty. Wedning presents
were numerous and nice, so were the wishes that
followed the young couple on their honeymoon,
per steamer, en route for Bathurst.

Among the round of cycling festivities last
week, the Sunurban Club gave a smoke concert at
Kainford's. Soon after eight, the room was filled
with young men and smoke. There was also a
quantity of “uas” about. Cigars were passed
freely round, and a distribution of vouchers was
made, so that when any young man got dry he
cjuld go out and allay his thirst, and, at the same
time, study the question of the abolition of bar-
maids. In a little while, the air was so thick that
no one could seo whether the songs were well
sung or not; but there was plenty of applause.
The best, however, were two pretty ones by Mr.
Scott, and two by Mr. H. Peir. Mr. Harris was
successiul in his comic efforts; and Mr. B. Palmer
recited " The shipwrecked Crew ” in bis best style.
Messrs. A. Edwards, C. Chambers, B. Lloyd, A.
Usher, E. Jeffreson. Fletcher, and Snowball all
gave selections, Mr. Chris. Shepherd being the chief
accompanist. Mr. A. Brooks was rather novel
with his soprano voice ; Mr. Hodge varied the
vocalised music with a saxophone solo; and piccolo
and flute were well played by Messrs. Somerville
and Christie. A sad song, entitled "The way my
father raised me," was contributed by -nr, D.
Mcikle, and the general impression was that bis
father had taken unnecessary trouble. Mr. F. J.
Empson s bicycle song, “ Riding through Victoria, ’
may have suited the particular audience, but it
will probably be much more valuable in a few
years than it is now—because nobody will have a
copy. About half-past nine " here was an interval
for the voucher business, when there were a good
many encores, or “ the same again,’’ and the smoke
concert closed before eleven o’clock.

At Hope House, Manly, an enjoyable party
was given last week. The rooms were beautifully
decorated, and dancing in two apartments was
carried on till after 3 a.m., intervals occurring for
refreshment. As the last boat leaves incon-
veniently early, Mr. and Mrs. Tedd suggested that
their guests should stay the night, and breakfast
next morning was a good finish to the festivity.
The hostess wore a handsome black satin skirt and
ruby velvet redingote lined with old gold; hair
dressed blah. A tall, sweet-eyed brunette was
most graceful in a quiet silk; and another, from
Darlinghurst, with a perfect profile, obliged wRh..
some of the best dance music. A gentleman Irrifn-
Hunter’s Hill also contributed with voice and
fingers to others’ pleasure. A brunette in pink
looked fascinating, with an Immense fan artisti-
cally handled; and two fair graceful girls in pink
were much admired.

“ Eton,” Summer Hill, was the scene of an
enjoyable party last week, when guests assembled
to help Mr. and Mrs. A. J. Gray celebrate the
twelvtn anniversary of their marriage. Dancing
wa», of course, tne chief source of pleasure, bur,
to vary the proceedings, the hostess, who was at-
tired in a becoming black satin and lace, warbled,
as days of yore, a couple of sweet songs, Mrs.
Harris and Miss Coston also contributed vocalism.
This made a nice break between the dances, music
for which was supplied by guests in good style,
the palm, however, being taken by Mr. Palmer.
Miss Rowley’s pretty face adorned a pink India
muslin, looped with narrow ribbons of many
colours, and open bodice with quite a garden of
flower?. Miss Evans was bright in cream satin and
lace, with cardinal jabot, not forgetting the gold-
dust hair. Mrs. Ellis looked well in a very band-
some blaca surah and broche, and Miss Mackenzie,
player of a beautiful waltz, elegant in black silk
and lace, with cardinal jabot held with a buckle at
waist. From “ Kyamba ” came a sprightly dancer
in fawn cashmere, black velvet body: and "Aire-
dale" was represented by a lady iu rich dress,
combining seal-brown satin and velvet. Miss
Coston looked well in a fashionable black broche
with Elizabethan collar. Midnight started the
Sydney contingent home, but the local element
kept toe ball rolling till 2 a.m.

Vi get room to walk the lawn to the
familiar tones of the Teutonic tootlers, and
Lumbers of ladies took advantage of the op-
portunity to show their toilettes. Champion
upnnett, instead of contesting with Shackelford,
found it much easier work to escort a young lady
ahnutthe lawn, who looked nice in an olive-green
Vioth dress with velvet sleeves, and is a popular
V rl in an eastern suburb. Miss Dean gladdened
Sin lawn a good deal In a very neat grey cloth
Press, with black medallions bea ded thereon.
Miss kahlo wore a peculiar braid, sort of brown
w th red Pnes. with a cardinal belt, and very cage-
ilke skirts. With a party of elderly ladies, a charm-
ing little semi-blonde was observed in a toilette of
excellent taste-black silk redingote, with revers
Pf dull gold, and belted with a double row of pearls;
and notwithstanding that her black bonnet bore
Considerable resemblance to a small coalscuttle, it
was as piquant a little affair as any lady could
dpsire and carried a canary feather on top thereof.
The taste of Miss Robertson was displayed in
elegance, as usual, her conspicuous articles of
wear being a symmetrical black with cardinal
belt jabot, and long silk gloves. Miss Perdriau
was’very bright and pretty in a cloth dress of
darkest brown, with fur trimming to match: and
a Henri Deux hat and leather of dark-brown were
in harmony with the rest. A pedestrian amateur,
who has won countless cups, escorted a young lady
of Surrv Hills in a light drab cloth, pleated, and
draped with pointed apron and back drapery, all
trimmed with brown velvet; small cape complet-
ing a quiet and neat costume. The lady so much
admired at the cyclists’ ball in black and gold,
looked exceedingly handsome in navy-blue picked
off with crimson: and the Glebe belle, who looked
so pretty in white satin and frayed edging at the
game ball, was followed by lots of admiring eyes
as she walked the lawn in a maroon cashmere
tucked round the skirt, and ardoise gloves. The
tail gentleman from Queensland was sandwiched
in a very enviable manner between two nice girls;
one wore flesh-oink veiling over a black lace skirt,
the other a very charming stoue-coloured polo-
naise atop of a rich purple velvet skirt, while an
overwhelming hat and feather shaded a sparkling
brunette face beneath. Miss Day, w 0 obahra, wore
a rich dress—green cloth skirt, decked round with
small Vandykes, and overskirt of brown and red
brocaded in arabesque design. A noticeable dress
was so because, on the pleated and tucked ardoise
akirt an immense green parrot had perched. A
very’ neat pair of costumes were maroon and
green cloth, respectively, worn by two handsome
girls in company with a lortunate young gentle-
man Miss Florrie Hyam’s toilette was a really
beautiful black velvet, corded behind, with large
hat and plume to match, which provoked a deal of
admiration from lady connoisseurs of toileterie.
Another, all black, in merino and crape, was nice
because of the simple taste of the maidenhair and
white snowdrops on the breast. A young amateur
musician was in company with a tall belle, who
wore plum-ooloured garb oound with lines of gold.
One of the fust specimens of the Mary Anderson
toilet was of nutmeg-bmwn, the pleats so fine as
to look almost like leaves of a book, worn by a
young girl ; it was a most covetable kind of costume
in the eyes of many wistful young ladies in the
stand A shrimp-pink veiling caught everyone’s
eve by its colour; the owner did not seem to mind
everyone’s eye. 'From Stan more, a handsome
young lady was s?en in fawn silk aud cashmere of
two snades, and hat to match; and a North Shore
demoiselle was stylish and admired, all in black
fiighmere, and very neat. Opinions varied as to
the effect of a peculiar dress worn by a fair girl-
brown silk, trimmed with chenille fringe, the skirt
mostly a tpixture o: brown snd green pompadour
pattern; it wap elaborate, and, like the opinions,
very varied, but it might have passed if only there
hadn’t bee ■ a horrid nme leather iu the brown hat
—ffiat was too much. Altogether, it was intert st-
ing watching the races, and instructive gaziau at
tie raiment, and as the German Band played, the
afternoon was pleasant enough.

About forty “gay*and festive” couples
assembled id the Oddfellows’ Hall, Orange,
at the last assembly of the Mercauiilers, and
whirled the hours away till 1 a.m. to the music
of Green’s efficient band. About 30 dances were
done waltzes most popular. A Sale-street quar-
tette' as usual, competed for the covered honour;
and a tall lady in blac’isiik, low bodice and short
sleeves was very near it. The belle of Anson-
streer in pale moonl ght satin, and anew face
from the same street, adorning blacs broche
draped with pale blue sash, were much admired.
The treasurer introduced a petite brunette in a
tasteful light faille. A little charmer from Byng-
street was bewitching m cream satin and pink
rosebuds - and a Salp street wajtzer showed to
advantage a handsome black silk. A visitor In
cream obliged with pianoforte extras. Blapit and
gold looked well or. a Teymi us representative,
and a Bathurst visitor danced we 1. A stranger in
lavender veiling drew universal adrp ration. Iho
full programme of a Kite-street damsel in black
and cardinal betokened a favourite. The daughters
of the Mayor, in blue satin, were popqlar; aud a
number of other pretty dresses and dancers circled
In file throng.

On Tuesday, 5tb August, Mr. Charles
Smith Mayor of Melbourne, gave one of the
grandest balls yet held in the town Hall. Invita-
tions bad been sought for weeks w;ta the most
eager aviditv, and the dross prep rations made
small fortunes tor the fashionable modiste?. Over
1500 people were present, and, if surging about,
dressed iu the grandest of toilets that were crushed
or trod on every minute, constituted enjoyment,
the 1500 got it. Dancing, till after midnight was
jnerelv a farce, notwithstanding the lunelullest
(strains of Warnecke s delightiul band. Soon
after 11 an adjournment was made for supper,
spread W Clements, but no human ability
could plan a supper for fifteen hundred
at a public ball-where everyone wants to
be among the first to sit down-wi;h comfort.
•The tables accommodated 500 at a time, and the
Governor made a brief speech. Then he left, and
dancing continued till about 4 o clock. The hall
was lit dv electricity, and copiously decorated, the
great organ being a huge mass of foliage a id
beautiiui fernery. The opening quadrille was
formed by the Governor and M.s« Smith vis d-vis
to the Hon. James Graham and Miss Ward Cole, of
Brighton- Lady Clarke and Lieutenant Nicholls,
Sir W J Clarke aud Miss Mitchell, the Mayor and
(Lady Loch, and Lord Uastierosse with Miss F.M
Smith The wife of the Governor, who is a fair
grad stately woman, wore a low-necked and sleeve-
less dress of ivory duchesse satin, pointed bodice,
with festoons of fine lace over a pleated petticoat;
pearls aud ostrich plume on her hair, leather tan
to match costume. The Mayor’s daughter wore a
magnfficent velvet, burgundy pattern brocaied
on a gold ground, and burgundy velvet tram;
the front skirt was formed in accordion pleats,
and the side draperies were caught with che-
nille ornaments. Mrs. James Butters, as ever,
■was the embodiment of style, wearing a satin robe
Of turquoise blue, with square cordage of royal
blue velvet, decked with forget-me-nots; tur-
quoise jewels matched he dress. The costume of
Mrs. Nicholas Fitzgerald was a handsome combina-
iion of lavender und white-striped moire, witii
white lace trimming, Mrs. Mortimer Franklyn
displayed a cream brocade, set off with tulle and
ostrich tips. The dress worn by Miss Maggie
Knight was sage green silk, blended with shell
p nk satin, green and cream feathers to finish.
Miss Derham’s was one of the loveliest dresses,
corsage and waterfall back of cream satin over
lace petticoat, trimmed with faded leaves. Mrs.
Moubray wore a splendid shrimp pink satin petti-
coat, corsage and t: ain of black silk velvet, feather
head dress. Miss Rowan’s ivory satin was adorned
with pear butterflies. A dress of white broche,
bodice and train, with satin skirt, was worn by
Miss Mitchell; and Miss Ward Cole, also in the Go-
vernor's quadrille, wore white silk, cut low and
sleeveless, and decked with ivy leafage. Mrs Nor-
man Wilson w .re cream satin and draperies; Lady
O’Logblen, cream lace skirt, with bodice aud
waterfall of cerise mervellleux; Lady Nicholson,
cream duchesse satin and ruby velvet corsage;
Miss Clarke, cream silk and coffee lace sleeves and
trimming; Miss Fanny Smith, coral pink brocade,
knittings, draperies, aud f n all ensuite. The robe
of Lady Clarke was a glowing amber colour,
chiefly composed of net, decked with lilies of the
valley, low silk bodice. As a show ot dress, Mr.
Charles Smith’s ball was magnificent; as a dance,
it was a failure. And, oh! the bitterness of those
who were not asked. But they smiled sweetly,
and said they were not going because they knew
it would be “ dreadfully mixed.”
■ • ♦
A pleasant, well-attended ball was held at
“ Weldon.” Burwood, on Friday evening last.
Though 40 couples were present, the bail-room
was never inconveniently full, owing to its size,
and the fact of many of the dances being sat out,
by couples who lost themselves in odd corners of
the garden. The supper arrangements were better
than often is the case, and there was plenty of
music, which was good before and after supper.
Some of the ladies were very stylishly dressed; the
hostess wore fawn-coloured silk and broche. Her
two fair daughters looked charming in pale-blue
and white respectively. Among the guests, par-
ticularly noticeable were two sisters from Glebe
Point, the stately figure of the elder and amiable
manner of the younger, combined with good
dancing, secured them many partners. “ Clythie ”
sent two pretty sisters in pink nun’s-veiling and
broche. From North Shors came a brunette in
cream satin, handsomely embellished with lace.
Two daughters of a wealthy squatter of “ Arthurs-
leigh ” wore very handsome toilettes, which lent
brightness to the scene. “Presteigu ” sonta pretty
blonde in cream satin dress and blue and cardinal
flowers, whose programme was quickly filled. A
granddaughter of an eminent barrister looked
sweetly pretty, and danced, perhaps, the best in
the room. Redmyre sent another blonde, who
looked nice in cream ana heliotrope. The dancing
was kept up well into Saturday morning by those
who had not to get to town by the midnight train.

The quiet little township of Hinton was
gay last week. A concert was given in the School
of Arts, in aid of the Scotch burial gruund. We
can’t conceive of a more cheerful object—unless
it might be dancing in a R.G. schoolroom to get a.
scorched soul out of purgatory. Three nights
after, the bachelors gave a ball and supper. Danc-
ing began early, ana ended at five, and, consider-
ing that Hinton was made late iu the scheme of
creation, the dresses were well up to tue times
Miss Stuart, of Hinton, was charming in navy
blue, and was belle. Mits Partridge, in white,
from Morpeth, was pretty good ; and Miss E.
Beattie, from Phoenix Park, in white and maioon
belt, was graceful. A Nelson's Plains young lady,
in maroon velvet, was far from plain; aud an In-
verell girl was iaverellegant and fascinating in
black attire. Music was arood, and tapper pro-
vided by an esteemed local lady.

On Wednesday, 6th instant, the Protestant
Hall, Queaubeyan, was the scene of a pleasant
gathering, when about fifty ladies and gentlemen
met and enjoyed a programme ot twenty-four
dances. Some of the ladies’ dresses were very
handsome, notably that ot Mrs. Farrar, a lovely
pale pink satin, made beautifully and trimmed
with cream lace; also that of her sister-in-law,
Mrs. De Sails—rich cream satin and lace, made
similarly. Mrs. Mackellar wore mauve and black
silk; and Mrs. Richardson, black silk trimmed with
cream and cardinal. Mrs. Emery wore black silk
and pink and silver flowers: Mrs. Dulhunty, black
silk, cardinal flowers. Mrs. M’Cord bad a becoming
dress—white trimmed with cardinal; Mrs. Wood-
ward, a black grenadine with white flowers; Mrs
Evans, cream satin, cardinal trimming with red
roses; Mrs. Herring, olive-green satin trimmed
with cream lace; Mrs. Morgan, pale blue silk skirt,
maroon velvet body, pale pink roses. Among
the sisters, daughters, and cousins, Miss Mac-
kellar looked charming in pale blue nun’s
veiling and satin, trimmed effectively with sil-
ver braid : and the dancing ot a lively little
belle, Miss McDonald, was much admired, also
her tasteful costume of white and pale blue
with trailing sprays of ivy. The Misses Wiight
looked very nice—one in pale pink trimmed with
cream lace and crimson roses, and the other in
pale blue, made very prettily, and trimmed with
cream lace and pale blue flowers. The Misses
Kemp, in effective black costumes, and Miss
Willaus, in white tarletan trimmed very tastefully
with white satin, hand-painted, had many ad-
mirers. Miss Smith, from Canberra, looked very
nice in white tarletan pale blue sash and silver
flowers; as also aid Miss Jefferies in black silk and
grenadine. The Misses Fanner were attractive-
one in black silk trimmed with cream lace, the
other in blue trimmed with the same. Good
music was supplied by Mr. Marsh, a local amateur,
who presided at the piano. Mr. Emery, the popu-
lar Crown Lands agent, undertook the major part
of the work in getting up the assembly. Dancing
was kept UP until three o’clock the following
morning, when the company separated, well
pleased with their evening, and wishing such re-
unions were more frequent.

A ball was held in the Temperance Hall,
Wollongong, last week, under the auspices of the
Harmony Band. Altogether, it was a mosc har-
monious' affair. The.ro was a trifling misunder-
standing between the ladies, though. It appears
the Wollongong girls were nowhere with their
country qousins, wflo, besidts revellin in the
ruddiest of ruddy complexions, came out in their
best dairy attire, and left no room for a local girl
to jump tue honours of belle. West Dapto sent iu
the pick of its farm?yard in the shape of four viva-
pious lady-birds. Toe queen of the q .artette was
the best-dres-ed girl in the room; her i ress being
p? black silk broche, with a neat pink puff sash
artfully let in, and embellished by gorgeous moon-
light trimming. Another pretty dress was worn
by a good dancer, the bodice being of ruby velvet,
and the skirt of Buruiah muslin. A buxom i.am-
sel donned a dress of cream and blue broche
sateen with nice effect, and two sisters f n m Dapto,
in ro'iring evening dresses, were the essence of
simplicity. Dancing was kept up till nearly 4
o’clock.

Camperdown belles wore alike dresses of black,
with cardinal fedoras and loops. A petite brunette
looked happy in cream veiling and pink satin.
The Mechanics’ ball took place in July at
Suva, Fiji, Jadies being rather scarce. Miss
Solomon was one of the most charming figures
in the ball-room, and Miss Moore also an ex-
tra attractive young Jady. Dancing is by no

WONDERS OF THE AGE.
Why is it so many people are never satisfied ?
Their homes are marvels of comfort and luxury,
friends are generous and affectionate ; they are
educated and refined, capable, not only of enjoy-
ing, but of imparting happiness to others; yet
they are dissatisfied, miserable, and, really without
intending to do so, make others miserable. Their
blood is impure, they have taken a heavy cold, or
they are bilious. A few doses of Emil Frese’s
Hamburg Tea would remove all obstructions, and
enable them to enjoy, with renewed zest, the plea-
sures they are now compelled to forego.
FOR THE GUIDANCE OF OTHERS.
Glenmore Road, Paddington,
14th January, 1884.
Gentlemen,—Some few weeks since I was so
severely affected with indigestion as to render my
rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
pain on account of severe pains in the back; and
it had just become necessary for me to take a holi-
day from my work, for the performance of which
I was by no means fit, when a friend mentioned to
me the benefit he derived from the use of Ham-
burg Tea. In the hope of getting some relief, I
used it myself, the result being that I was myself
in three or four days, and have not suffered since.
My friends have advised me to write this for the
guidances of others, and you are at liberty to make
what use you please of this.
Tours, ,
JOHN KELLY.
Messrs. Elliott Bros., Sydney.


Political Points
The fashion in which it is possible for
capitalists to defeat the best organised local resist-
ance to otarvation wages is exemplified by the
case of the lace indust y. since machinery dis-
placed handicraft. At Nottingnam, the removal
of machines to Scotland, where labour can be had
cheap, has thrown numbers of Nottingham workers
Into great dlstres'. The only remedy for this is
organization of Lab >ur for mutual defence all over
the world. The lesson win oe learned all the
quicker for the severity with which it is being
taught by Capital.
The Paris Cri du Peddle (the Cry of the
People) warns the Irish labourers against Mr.
Parnell’s peasant-proprietary project. The Cri
Bays:—“ What does it matter to Irish peasants
whether the landlord bo Irish or Saxon, Catholic
or Protestant? They ire robbed of their labour
under either, and let the Irish make no mistake;
they will not find a native middle-class less cruel
than aliens. At any rate, English workers have
received no mercy at the hands of English factory
lor is. The struggle of this century is between
those who work and those who prey.”
It is just a little singular that at the very
time when the federation ot the empire is being
pothered about by people in England, the Ad-
miralty should evince the actual superciliousness
with which the colonies are regarded by denying
to colonial war-ships the right to liy the white
en«lgn. The colonial tars are evidently required to
“kejp their place ” and admit - , their social in-
feriority to the Royal Navy. Suppose, now, when
:next the Imperial authorities urge us to provide
for our own defence, we insist upon using the
iSame flags, uniforms, and badges as the home
forces!
The zeal of some of the Russian police in
•detecting Nihi.ists is of a quality which would be
worthy of all praise did it not seem calculated in
'some ogre * to lead to the punishment of persons
•entirely innocent Photographs of Degaieff, the
man who killed -Sudeikin, have been sent to all the
police offices throughout Russia. The photographs
Were in six different positions, a complete sat
being sent to each office. Shortly after the re
ceipt of the photographs, one zealous police offi-
cer telegraphed to St. Petersburg that he had
already arrested four of the criminals and hoped
to secure shortly the remaining two.
THE TWO SLAVERIES.
“Slaves cannot breathe In England,”
O idle Patriot boast;
Look, In our “ merry London,”
At Labour’s weary host.
Freedom of Competition'
No genuine freedom yields,
And Hunger’s whip’s as cutting
As the lash a master wields.
Yet, from sordid court and alley.
Echo cries with altered breath,
“Slaves cannot breathe In England,”
We are crowding them to death.
Good Heavens I Tbink how fat it must
have been when It was too fat for the Echo. This
Iilece of exceeding richness was a bit of unearned
norement—in Its simple adiposity describable
thus:—“A grant of 3U00 acres was Issued to the
Australian Agricultural Company for land near
Newcastle, la November, 1847. Nothing was paid;
the land being granted for the purpose of en-
couraging the cultivation of the waste lands of
the colony. One acre perches (unimproved)
was resumed in 1883 for the Great Northern line,
and 31 acres and 33 perches (also unimproved) in
the same year for the Hue from Homebush to
Waratah. The Company for tne small portion
demanded £977. for the 38 acres £118 489.” Com-
ment vans por t—we mean - Is needless.
Some little time ago we pointer 1 out in an
article, “ Malthus v George,” that the very root of
Henry George's theories was his repudiation of
the frightful doctiiues of Malthus, so long ac-
cepted by political economists and even—to their
shame—by the clergy of all denominations We
observe now that this has struck others as well
■o irselves. Samuel Bennett, formerly one of the
o liters of the Kaoical, writes to Justice:— ‘ One
thing we are all likely to be agreed on before long,
•except Mr Bradlaugh and his worshippers; and
that is that Mr George struck the correct key-
note when he ‘went for’ Malthusianism as the
root of all the Errors in political e •onomy. The
metaphor here used may be somewhat mixed, but
I do not care for that so long as I am understanded
of the people.”
Granny, in a review of De Maupas’ “ Story
Of the Coup d'Etat ,” says she must do the author
Justice by saying that he was a model Prefect of
Police. An infamous fox, who Pou-
ch6 in his callous indifference to honour, morality,
and truth, in his employment of an inconceivably
base mouchard systom, in his hellish concoction
of false plots as means of attack against the
patriotic—such a miscreant “a model Prefect of
Police” 1 Why, bad as was the exploded theory of
“set a thief to catch a thief,” It was better, infi-
nitely better, than that on which the Little Napo-
leon acted—the wholly execrable police theory of
setting a scoundrel to harass and entrap honest
men. If there be a hell, and hot places in it, then
amongst the hottest are surely those reserved for
the “ Man of December ” and Granny’s “ model
Prefect of Police,”
The Wagga Star scores a point against
the A.G.-yrawating Jones when it observes
“At the election of 1883, Mr. A. G. Jones (rejected
In 1881), the upholder of remission of interest, was
returned by a great majority He always averred
that he would work iu his place in Parliament
until he had brought about the remission of Inter-
est; he would never lose sight of it; and his paper
(the Advertiser) teemed with articles In favour
of it. Any concession to conditional purchasers
would aid in bail ling up a yeomanry which would
do more to develope and enrich the colony than all
other classes put together. ... By voting for
Mr. Slattery s amendment was an opportunity
given our member to prove that he was in earnest
In his avowed convictions. What do we find ?
That Mr. Jones voted for this concession to the
conditional purchaser? No; he voted with the
Government, aaainst it! ” We kinder guess it will
be A gee Jones next election.
During the intensest period of the Irish
League movement, it was habitual for the
iajwUord organs to charge the ad ocaD-s and Press
supporters of the peasantry with offering “ in-
citeun nta to mutder.” Now let us turn the reverse
of the medal. The Saturday Review, an organ
of the fortunate classes, the other day published
the foil >wing:-“Talk as much as you like, appeal
as much as you like to the Deity or to the late
Kan Marx, to the laws of Nature or the Jaws of
Martha's Vineyard, bur. directly you trv to put
your ideas in practice, up you go to the nearest,
and most convenient gaJows. unless it happens to
tpe more convenient to shoot you! That is the
right way of treating Mr. George and Mr. Hynd-
man, and Mr. Wallace and Mr. Davitt, and all the
rest of the apostles of plunder.” London Justice
quotes this and adds: “Working men. cut this
incitement to murder out, when you have read it,
and remember the sort of men you have to meet
gnd reckon with."
It seems that Kenry George’s lecturing tour
in England and Scotland wasn't a financial success
—hence Conservative Commercialism, that granges
everythin? by its mere money value, brays loudly
anent the Utopian visionary’s failure In the capa-
city of agitator. Jesus wasn't exactly a financial
success, neither was Spinoza nor Rousseau, and
yet they each did a bit of leavening work in their
day-work equal to the task of the pulling down
of strongholds and shattering of shams. So George,
though he mayn't have drawn like a divine Sarah,
and has most certainly brought down on his
devoted head the curses loud and deep of the
Erlests and worshippers of Territorialism, yet has
e sown good seed in fitting soil—seed, or we are
much mist'ken, that will fructify a thousandfold.
When the harvest is over, it will be time to reckon
up whether the sowing season was so much wasted
time.
The Argonaut (’Frisco) contends that, as
the United States, before the Geneva Arbitration
Tribunal in the Alabama case, pleaded that “a
nation cannot relievo itself of responsibility by
pleading that its laws do not permit it to interfere
in a given case—the local law is hot to be taken as
the limit of international obligation in the eye of
the law of nations,” their Government cannot
consistently decline to take steps to suppress
dynamite conspiracy, having for its object iojux-y
to citizens of a foreign State, even if the local law
be insufficient for the purpose; and as precedent
points out that Mr. Seward (acting on the principle
that a nation is never bound to furnish asylum to
dangerous criminals who are offenders against tho
human race) turned over Argiielles, a slave-trader,
to the Spanish authorities, although there was no
extradition treaty with Spain covering the case;
also that later Spain reciprocated by returning to
the United States the fugitive Tweed in tho
absence of treaty obligation so to do.
“ Abyssinia is to be allowed to annex Kas-
sala and Amedeb as a reward for relieving the
Egyptians.” The wickedness of the proposal is of
a piece with all that England has yet done, or at
the doing whereof she has connived, in regard to
the affairs of the peoples of Egypt and the Soudan.
Why should she tempt a brutal madman like
Johannes with permissions to annex here and an-
nex there?-as if her permissions to perpetrate
such crimes were valid 1 Why should she seek any
sort of alliance at all with an insane despot, a
wretch who cuts of the feet and hands of those
who offend him, who puts out their eyes by pour-
ing hot tallow into them, who cuts off the
noses of those who take snuff and the lips of those
who smoke? To invite the aid of such an irrespon-
sponsible tyrant is as bad as was the setting a price
on the head of Osman Digna. It is to conduct war
as savages—to break wholly away from the few
courtesies with which civilisation had partially
sue eeded in tempering the brutalities of war.
“Abyssinia is to be allowed to aunex” Hell I
Mr. W. H. Mallonk’s treatise, “Property
and Progress” (wherewith it is assumed by the
Jingo crowd that the Georgian contention has
been tamed inside out and knocked into a cocked
hat) recalls (to the Athenaeum) the time when it
was the ideal of young men of fashion to stand
forth as the champions of their “ order,” and to
be petted as such at the tea-tables of dowager
Duchesses. Mr. Mallock has approached these grave
problems insufficiently trained in economics, la-
mentably Ignorant of statistics. If we have de-
voted any attention to this work, with its specious
title and partisan tendency, it is only in order to
take occasion for protesting against such a treat-
ment of grave and pressing problems of national
importance. The alienation of the lower classes
from all that makes life interesting and ennobling
is by far the most serious aspect of the problem.
Mr. Mallock’s party pamphlet, it is needless to say,
utterly misses the significant points of this pro-
blem. Indeed, it is doubtful if Mr. Mallock has
benefited his party, since the tendency of his argu-
ments is to show how small is the share of the
landowners in the national income compared with
their influence on national politics.
Confirmation strong as holy writ to at
least some of the theories of Henry George is fur-
nished by the condition of Ireland since the reduc-
tion of rent by the operations of the Land Act,
Returns anew the reductions for the present year
to amount to £3,000,000. A London despatch to
the N Y. Sun points out that this practically
leaves that sum in the pockets of the farmers, and
that “ tnroughout Ireland the beneficial result is
palpable. Poor people who have for years seldom
had a shilling of money in their possession, now
occasionally may be seen in small shops, happy in
their ability to expend an occasional half-sove-
reign. The general effect on the temper of the
people is very perceptible. The farmers, and shop-
keepers who depend upon them, »re decidedly
bettor off than they have been for several years
On the other hand, the upper class of storekeepers,
whose trade consists chiefly in supplying the
nobility and landlords, compiaiu of the dulness of
trade. This accounts tor the conflicting reports
which now go out rom Ireland. It you go into a
first-class shop, you hear that trade was never
worse, and if you go into the second class shops, it
is generally admitted that trade was never better,”
Now, conceive this reduction carried to the point
of leaving to labour nil its earnings, and apply the
principle to Great Britain also. Then think out
the probable result for yourself.
The Seamen’s Union of N.S.W. would do
well to ponder on this bit of information, drawn
from Fairpuay, an English shipping organ:—** It
is said that Mr. William Pearce, sole partner of the
firm of John Elder and Co., will clear at least
£100,000 profit on the two steel steamers he is
building for the Cunard Company. This is partly
by reason of a fall in the cost of material, hut
chiefly by the ichicllun in uayes." A cool adrais-
sion this. It moans that Capital, in this instance,
has been able to take Labour by the throat, using
as an instrument for garotting, the competition
among working men for a mere subsistence, and
the necessity of taking what wages they can get
or of starving outright, to pocket something like
£100,000, which, under fairer adjustments, would
have been the reward of Labour. Say it takes 10 <0
men a year—we give random figures—to build the
two steamers: then each man’s labour has been in
that year worth £100 more than he will receive
The capitalist will retain these thousand sums of
£100 each. Yet peoplelike Mr Giffen, the essayist,
deny that under existing social conditions it is
true that the rich become richer, the poor poorer.
Of course, the whole £100,000 must not be reckoned.
Something must be allowed as interest on ma-
chinery, capital, buildings, and so forth; and
something for management and superintendence.
But say half—£50,000 That would leave £50 a year
to 100 men. Thriftless dogs I why don’t working
men save? Perhaps it is because their employers
obligingly do it for them by appropriating all
margin above bare subsistence.
Minister Dibbs says that it is a waste of
time to bring matters before the Assembly which
might be brought bet ore him as actiog-Minister
for Works. Perhaps so;' only, if so, that little
matter about the alleged monopoly by Wright,
Heaton, and Co. on the Armidale to Glen Innes
railway extension doesn’t seem to come into the
category. Anyway, though Dibbs has obtained a
lot of information from Whitton about the exten-
sion—when it will be opened, and so on—not a
single bit has he given the Assembly on that one
point, anent which the country so yearns for in-
formation—viz., were the contractors for the
extension allowed to charge for the conveyance of
goods along it, and did they (having such permis-
sion) so work into the bands of Wright, Heaton,
and Co. as to secure for that carrying firm a mono-
poly ? These be questions that it may suit the
Department to shelve: yet they constitute matters
which the Assembly should make strict inquiry
about—and that, whether Mr. Secretary Wright
happens to be sick or not. What has his sickness
to do with the aifair? There’s a deal too much
nonsense about the impropriety of attacking
members behind their backs. Where the public
Interests are concerned, private convenience, as
well as the etiquette that should ordinarily obtain,
must give way. What is done in Parliament is so
fully reported that an attack proved to be unjus-
tifiable can injure no man’s reputation. Where
the attack is proved to have been justifiable—well,
in that case, who will venture to say that any per-
sonal considerations whatever sjould have pre-
vented its having been made ?
No wonder they called Her Majesty’s pre-
decessor on the tbrone “Silly Billy.” Here is the
report of a speech of his (delivered in the “Lords”
when he was Duke of Clarence in 1794) H.tt.H.
urged “that, as France had set the example of
cutting off the heads of their King and Queen, it
was not at all Improbable that the same system
might be adopted in other countries, and Europe
might exhibit the extraordinary spectacle of
thrones without kings, and kings without heads
[that spectacle was certainly exhibited when the
speaker succeeded his Royal brother, ‘the first
blackguard in Europe.’] As to any alarm for the
safety of their country, he deprecated the idea of
it, so long as his gallant brother was at the head of
the army, who, no doubt, before the end of the
ensuing campaign, would drive the French back
into their own territory, and force them to sue for
peace at the feat of their royal conqueror. He
was thoroughly convinced that the war was highly
popular with the people of this country, who were
more than desirous to protect their blessed Consti-
tution, their laws, their rights, and privileges from
the attac ' s and encroachments of French regicides
who, by the prowess of his royal brother, would
soon be made to answer for the enormity of their
crime. The English people he knew to be brave,
generous, and loyal, and although he would not
recommend the general principle of intervention
in the affairs of other nations, yet when they car-
ried their revolutionary spirit to that excess as to
cut off the heads of their King and Queen, then,
indeed, would England be highly culpable and
deserving of the contempt of all the nations of
Europe, if she did not interfere and show the regi-
cides that they were not to cut off the heads of
kings and queens like so many poppies in a garden
without meeting the severest punishment, by cut-
ting off their heads in return.”
The Archbishop of Canterbury is reported
to have spoken, at a meeting of the Bast London
Church Fund, of “ wickedness whose natural gar-
ment was misery,” and again to have s«id that
“ the cause of the extremest misery was wicked-
ness—it was drink, and other sins he would not
name.” It is easy to undors'and from this how it is
that the poor regard the Church as their enemy,
and as allied with the classes who grind them
down. The Archbishop's remarks contained a
stinging half-truth. But are the wreteiied the
class an Archnishop should elect to scourge ? Or
was this the right half of the truth to be spoken
under the circumstances ? That the extremest
misery is want intensihed by drink and vice is
obviously true. But it is just as true, too, and more
important, that there is much wickedness which is
the natural offspring of misery. There are sins,
unnameable by a butter-mouthed servant of God,
which prevail in rookeries and slums. Partly be
cause people, become miserable through vice, live
in slums and continue their wickedness. But also
partly because people not naturally wicked have
to live in slum", and pig together, man, woman,
and child, to the destruction of innate decency
and of all morality. Besides, wickedness only
causes Intense misery among certain classes. Per-
haps themott linmora man in England to-day is
the Duke of Marlborough, and he has just got.
£90,000 or so by commuting' his family’s perpetual
pension, and has also about a quarter of a million
sterling worth of pictures to sell. The London
Church Reformer takes the Archbishop roundly
to task about these expressions of his, and .says
that while it is so comfortalle for well-to-do
people to be told that the misery of the poor is
owing to the faults ot the poor, it Is monstrously
un-Christian. “The garment of the wickedest
man in the Gospel—the only individual man whom
Jesus Christ spoke of as going to hell in torments
—was not misery, but nurple and tine linen; and
he was sent to hell simply because, day by nay, and
year by year, he had allowed the contrast between
rich and poor to go on as a matter ot course, un-
redressed.”
In view of the determined hostility of the
Conservatives to the Franchise Bill, and the tone
of even middle-class organs with respect to the
proposals of extensive reform, which are, with
daily increasing confidence and determination,
propounded by the rapidly growing Radical party,
it is clear that even were the latter to obtam, as
they assuredly will before the close of the century
a majority in the House of Commons, and form an
administration, or even should their sentiments be
adopted with enthusiasm by the non-franchised
mass of Englishmen, and yet be debarred from
obtaining adequate representation, any attempt to
carry out their principles will be resisted with
actual violence, even to the point of a civil Avar.
An immense deal will then depend upon the spirit
which may actuate the rank and file of theregu-
, lar army. That is to say, whether they will be
sufficiently in sympathy Avith tneir civilian
brethren to stimulate them to resist the habit of
unreasoning obedience to the word of command,
and the brute inclination for a tight whenever
confronted with a bristling adversary—an incli-
nation which is common to brute men and brute
beasts, such as bulldogs. Any bulldog Avill fight
any other bulldog, if “sooled on,” although
its adversary be its own father or brother.
Even sexual difference does not atail to tem-
per the saA r agery. So, also, with a brute sol-
diery. They will fight any adversary, at the
word of command, and commence an onslaught
with a certain fierce enjoyment. But set the rank
and file a-thinking. Displace the brutal by the
reasonable, and even the disciplined soldiers,
habituated as they are to obej like automatons
the word of command, evince a disposition to dis-
criminate. There are adversaries whom they won’t
fight. In several of the French revolutions, the
troops led forth to slaughter the people fraternized
with them. They had comprehended the rationale
of the conflict, and had recognised that the cause
of the people was their oavu. The British Army-
recruited as it is from generally the lowest classes,
instead of, as in the Continental States, every
grade passing t* rough th ranks, and the army
oretty fairly reflecting the opinions of the civil
population—has been peculi rrly inaccessible to
poliiifcal propagandist). It has been accustomed
to regard itself as a so’-t of military caste, haA’ing
no common interests with the masses. But since
the lower strata have commenced to heave and
work under the leavening influence of a renais-
sance of thought and reflection, the rank and file
of the army have in some degree shared the emo-
tion; and we learn from a Londo i Radical paper
that “ the men in the army, who, of course, come
directly from amongst the people, are utterly dis-
gusted with our present system. They begin to
see. none too soon, that they are simply paid to
fight against the interest of their own class abroad
by the very people who prey upon their labour at
home.”
In view of the rejection by the House of
Lords of the Franchise Bill, and of the struggle
which is about to commence, and is already
heralded by the monster meetings of the people
throughout England, nothing could be more appo-
site than the following description of the attitude
of the Peers with respect to the first Reform Bill.
It is an extract from a letter addressed to Lord
Salisbury, who moA'ed the rejection of the bill,
by “ Noblesse Oblige ” in the Echo—the London
Echo we mean, a downright Liberal organ, not
the Sydney penny whistle blown nightly in the
interests of a proprietary gorged with unearned
wealth:—“Was the rejection of the first Reform
Bill worth a civil war? Ycm would say No; but
your own father and the majority who followed
the Duke of We'lington would have said Yes.
They were ready to shed, not their own blood, but
the blood of the British army, in defence of their
places and pensions and privileges. Even when
the waA r erers had enabled the Government to
carry the second reading by a m jority of five, the
conspirators against the people were busy. They
had been at work in the dark poisoning the mind
of the King against his Ministers, and preparing
for a bloody suppression of public discontent.
They drove the Ministry from office, and immedi-
ately the whole country stood still. Commerce and
labour wore forgotten >n presence of the imminent
peril of the hour. It was a terrible crisis Every
officer was summoned to his post; the cat’alry were
furnished with ball cartridge, and kept booted and
addled; the Scots Greys were ordered to rough-
sharpen their sabres, so that they might better hack
to pieces the industrious artizaus of Birmingham.
Meanwhile, the people were assembling every-
where in vast multitudes, and resolving to pay no
taxes —men of property fraternising with the
common people: the Herts Yeomanry woke up
your father at Hatfield and flung their resigna-
tions in his face; the Common Council of the City
of London demanded that the House of Commons
should stop all supplies, and the run upon the
Bank of England grew daily more alarming. Had
the crisis lasted two days longer, the slaughter
would have begun. How was it avoided ? From
any reluctance on the part of that craven crew
who dared not incur the responsibilities of office,
to shed the blood of their fellow-countrymen ?
Not so. It was because they had discovered that
the very soldiery would have turned against them.
The Intent was plain enough. If only the man
who was then leader of the Lords could have relied
upon his own followers to take the responsibilities
of office, and could have relied upon the troops to
butcher the people, the streets of London and
Birmingham and all the chief toA\ns of the king-
dom would hate been deluged Avith blood. Two
hundred years before a high spirited aristocracy
would have drawn their swords, gathered re-
tainers, and flung themselves into the struggle;
hut these pitiful creatures, so soon as they found
that they could not compel the people to slay each
other, surrendered, as they professed to beliet’e,
the Crown, the Church, and the Constitution with-
out a single blow- There was nothing equal to
their folly except their cowardice.”

It is proposed to consolidate the various
societies which Mr. Henry George left behind him
in England in the different tOAvns at which he re-
cently lectured. “Land Restoration Societies”
for England, Scotland, and Ireland respectively
are now at work ; bestd is local societies or
branches in Hull, Birmingham, Liverpool, and
other places. The English Land Restoration
League at i s recent annual meeting reduced its
minimum subscription to one shilling, and laid
itself out for a A’igorous year’s work — In London
and vi -inage, during 1883, there were 44 cases of
death by starvation recor ded by coroner s inquests.
Unrecorded heathen only knows how many —
i here are in London 80,003 prostitutes This is 1 in
14of all London girls between the ages of Hand 20.
. .The Synod of the Free Church ot Scotland passed
a resolution calling on the Government to stop
evictions while the Crofter’s Commissioner's re-
port is under consideration. This shows how
popular the movement is becoming, for at first the
clergy opposed strongly all agitation— Proclama-
tions have been scattered broadcast from Moscow,
recalling to the memory of the Czar the Nihilist
letter of 1881, when he was told that if he wished
to escape the fate of his father he must give
Russia a Liberal Constitution, They remind him
that he has done nothing yet, and advise him to
make haste. It is reported th> t the Czar is about
to return to Qatschina, the only fortress where he
feels safe. So many men and women are being
deported to Siberia, that it is said the population
there will soon equal the population of Russia in
Europe.

EDGCUMBE’S HOTEL, ALBURY N.S.W.
AUSTRALIANS AT “HOME."
A correspondent thus gossips about Aus-
tralians in London: - “Mr. G. W. Paul, the face-
tious Queensland County Court Judge, has left
England for Australia, after 18 months’ sojourn in
the old country. His Honor has almost completely
recovered from the effects of the paralytic affec-
tion by which he was not long ago seriously
threatened. Mr. Rathbone, late editor and pro-
prietor of the Auckland Observer, has now set-
tled in London as correspondent for the associated
N.Z. evening press. Patchett Martin, late of Mel-
bourne and Australia in general, is writing, prin-
cipally on colonial subjects, for the English maga-
zines—notably for Temple Bah, in which he has
achieved more than one marked success. Hcnm-
ker Heaton, at latest, was busily engaged in fitting
up a very high-toned establishment at De vere
Gardens. Henniker is one of the bright lights of
St. Stephen’s Club, which, somewhat suggestively,
has an underground passage running between it
and the Houses of Parliament on the other side of
the street. The Parliamentary division-bell rings
in the Club, and will, so far as one can
hear, at no dis ant date, summon Henniker
as one of the members for Canterbury to
vote against th© Gladstone Government. The
constituency named has of late been disfran-
chised owing to corruption, but we are
sure J. H. H. won’t consent to represent it
until everything has been properly cleared up.
“Charley” Lett now lives in Paris, where his
daughter is being educated. He speaks French
with a strong Australian accent, and doesn t talk
about returning to the Hand of the kangaroo. W.
P. Morgan, the North Queensland solicitor and
wit. will soon be taking his departure from Lon-
don, where he has. for a good many months, been
encaged In perfecting a patent gold-saving pro-
cess, which threatens to be one ot the biggest
things the world has seen. It has two great fea-
tures—a pulveriser which reduces classes oi
ores, whether free-milling or complex, into amm-
palpable powder, silky to the touch as cork ash or
cigar-dust r and an amalgamator m which the
aforesaid powder is, under perfect conditions ot
retardment and distribution, passed upwards by
“gravitation” through 30 inches of heated mercury,
on arriving at the surface of which the waste ore
is blown away by a fan-blast of air. The process,
which saves 98 per cent, of gold from py-
ritous ores, which, when treated by stampers,
yields less than half the assayed contents,
has been investigated by the celebrated Crookes
and others, who appear to be in love with it, and
sav the right thing has been struck at last. It is
understood that Mr- “Jack” Newton, of Sydney,
is or was interested in the patent. The cricketers,
when In town, stay at the Tavistock Hotel, an old-
fashioned hostelry where none but bachelors are
admitted—a place where they feed one in country
fashion, make you drink your morning coffee out
of a basin and allow you to wipe your moustache
with a napkin eight yards long and weighing four
pounds. The “ boys ” are all well, barring Black-
ham, who just now is suffering from the
effects of the nasty blow ho got up North. The
team have had the good luck to play in and out
a little, and have thus brought about an interest in
their proceedings which would not have been felt
had they been uniformly victorious. It was one
of the biggest sights in the world to see Bpoff.
polish off the balance of the Gentlemen at Lord s
on the last day of the match. The Englishmen
seemed to lose their heads when they saw
this elongated incarnation of the Genius of weird
Melancholy (which Marcus Clarke tells us presides
over Australian forest and stream) place all his
men behind the wicket and proceed to bowl
• shooters.’ Phil. Benjamin, lately of the S.A. Re-
gister, and sometime of the Argus, is now m
London, and has abandoned the copy-slip of the
pressman for the invoice and ledger of the mer-
chant. He is trading on his own account. And
now, to wind up with something really big, Parkes
while here, was constantly en evidence—some-
times at the office of the Agent-General, sometimes
in a hansom, and sometimes in the Park, where he
drove daily with the rest of the aristocracy. The
other day he turned out in an open carriage, the
destinies of which were jointly controlled by a
man in livery—he looked as if he had heon hired—
and a lean horse very ‘groggy on his pins.’ The
old gentleman wore his hat on one side as usual,
and was accompanied by Miss Parkes. The
horse smiled as we passed—he was thinking,
probably, of what Dailey said about certain
schedules ana Leporello’s catalogue of the amours
of his wicked master; or. perhaos. he had heard ot
the Kiama ghost. Sir Henry still cultivates the
fine arts—be will always be artful -and is under-
stood to have made another collection. Which
recalls a good story. An old English gentleman,
returning from America in a Cumrd steamer, was
grumbling at the country he had just visited. No-
thing there was good enough for him—the hotels,
the railways, the government, and even the ladies
were not to be admired. His American fellow-
passengers began to chaff, and the old boy got
riled. ‘I’ll tell you what it is,’ said he at length,
furiously, ‘we Englishmen will have to go over
and take your country.’ ‘ What, again !' was the
quiet reply of a cynical Yankee. Henry lives in
Duke-street, which, so far as the more name is
concerned, is perhaps a rung lower than King-
street. Saul Samuel, like S. A. Joseph, is a very
great man among the London Hebrews; and, like
the rest of the colonial Agents-General, he is very
hard to see.”
A certain prominent Australian sporting
man, named L , was returning from Ascot
races when he saw approaching the Salvation
Army in full blast. They did not keep on their
course, however—they turned down a side street.
“That is a man,” they said, “ we utterly decline to
save.” “ He don’t stand in. if I know it,” added
“General” Booth. The “General’s” very latest
is to announce that, on an early date, a meeting
under his auspices, at Exeter Hall, will be “ad-
dressed by 500 saved drunkards.” Let us hope,
however, that at least a lew of the 500 will be too
drunk to speak.
The “A.B.C.” is a newly-established Lon-
don Club, where Americans, Britishers, and Colo-
nials may meet not only in ordinary social sense,
but for the transaction of biz. 'I alking of London
clubs, the members of the New Club, and their
friends, are able to enjoy performances at the
club theatre on Sunday morning—performances
the repertoire whereof the Examiner of Players
has not vised. The law connives at this, yet if the
same sort of little game were tried on at the White-
chapel end of the big smoke, what a rumpus
there’d be, and how orthodoxy would denounce
what it would call the immorality of the slums.
Here be some grammatical definitions re-
cently handed in at an examination of candidates
for pupil teachership“ Mood: The way or tem-
per in which an assertion is made, as when any
person is in a temper they might say, ‘ go, thou
senseless Idiot,’which is imperative. Tense: Tense
the force or intensity of meaning with which it is
said, as it it is gone and not likely to come again,
it is past tense, but if likely to come again it is
future. Voice: Voice means the way which the
speaker uses his tongue. For instance, if pitying
a suffering being he would say, ‘ Poor thing,’ with
a drawl at the end of the poor; but if saying so in
ridicule, he would say the same two words, but
with a very different stress on the first words, viz.,
* poor.’ ” Schoolmaster muchly abroad.
Society (London) writes“ ‘ The thing ft
self was neither rich nor rare. The only wonder
was how the devil it got there,’ wrote Byron of the
fly in amber.” One would have thought that So,
ciety knew that it was Pope who (in his “ Letter
Dr. Arbuthnot,” wrote —
“ Pretty! in amber to observe the forms
, Of hairs, or straws, or dirt, or grubs, or worms'
The things, we know, are neither rich nor rare
But wonder how the devil they got there.” ’
‘ Granny’s” own St. Petersburg oorrespon,
dent teUs us that “the late Emperor was inclined'
to introduce divorce as it is practised in Protestant
countries, but he hesitated to wound the suscepti.
blllties of the clergy.” Talk of sapping a creed
with solemn sneer, why Gibbon was a fool to
Granny's own Russian scribe. Alexander the
Second’s hesitancy to wound the susceptibilities of

The red tape on stock at the Bundaberg
Hospital is of a very stout kind. A poor fellow
who had fallen down a shaft and damaged himself
a lot, was brought to that institution the other day
and denied admittance because the ticket wasn’t
properly initialed. Had he died while his friends
were buzzing around the district endeavouring to
get the ticket put right. It would be an interesting
question for a debating class whether the death
lay at the door of the hospital that wouldn’t open
to an urgent case or at that of the homicidal
wretches who had neglected to fix up the ticket
en regie.
A gushing young poetess, named Edith
Howes, sings in “Mother Earth” the following
yearning, impalpable strain:—
“ I yielded all to a love unseen,
And my faith could nothing miss;
From a silver cloud he seems to lean.
And slowly his tender breath of green
Floats down the tree-tops that lie between
My lips and bis perfect kiss.”
A kiss served up with tree-tops and tender green
breath may to Edith be so satisfying as to cause
her to squirm hysterically; but our gal says the
idea is a precious sight too suggestive of the
“ morning after ” memories of she-oak and young
onions to be anything but extremely bad prose.
Here’s a little duck of a verse by Mrs. Fry,
on the Celestial Ray—
“ When sorrow hath tamed
The Impassioned eye,
And the bosom reflects
Its expected sky.”
Our own eye has often been tamed; but the rayi
sparkled too much to be celestial, although the
piece of raw meat was pasted on over a decidedly
azure patch. But our bosom, not to say our riba,
certainly reflected sky colour pretty fairly when
Larry had got in a few with his left. However
that was not what we wanted to s*y. What we
like about the verse is its gorgeous adaptability
for the purpose of a scribe paid by the inch. See
how it r uns into space :— <
When Larry had dimmed
Our little right eye,
And deftly had skimmed
Our nose all awry;
When our bosom was pumped
Of breath by his blows.
And our ribs were all thumped
Out of shape like our nose;
Then up went the sponge
Like a lark from her nest.
As we got one more lunge
And we groaned “give you best.”

EXPERIENCE.
The Rev. Z. P. Wilds, well-known city
missionary in New York, and brother
of the late eminent Judge Wilds, of the
Massachusetts Supreme Court, writes
as follows i
“78 E. 54 th St., Efew York, May 1G, 1882.
Messrs. J. C. Ayer & Co., Gentlemen :
Last winter I was troubled with a most
uncomfortable itching humor affecting
more especially my limbs, which itched so
intolerably at night, and burned so intense-
ly, that I could. scarcely bear any clothing
ovel ; lllenri I \Vas also a sufferer from a
severe catarrh and catarrhal cough; mV
appetite was poor, and my system ii good
deal run down. Knowing the value of
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla, by observation of
many other cases, and from personal use
in former years, I began taking it for the
above-named disorders. My appetite im-
proved almost from the first dose. After
a short time the fever and itching were
allayed, and all signs of irritation of the
skin disappeared. Sly catarrh arid cough
were also cured by the same means, and
my general health greatly improved, until
it is now excellent. I feel a hundred per
cent stronger, and I attribute these results
to the use of the Sarsaparilla, which
I recommend with all confidence as the
best bipod medicine ever devised. I took
ife id Siilall doses, three times a day, and
Used, in all, less than two bottles; I place
these facts at your service, hoping their
publication may do good.
Yours respectfully, Z. P. Wilds.”
The above instance is but one of the many
constantly coming to our notice, which prove
the perfect adaptability of Ayer’s Sarsa-
bARttEA to the cure of all diseases arising

The most candid man in the world is lie
who, when consigned to gaol in London the other
day, remarked: “ When I get into prison, I feel at
home.”
Certain of the Victorian militia have
"struck,” not for their altars and their hearths, as
warriors are generally expected to do, but for
uniforms and overdue “ screws.” It seems that
the South Melbourne Field Battery proudly leads
the van in this latest military movement, the mem-
bers of that corps having refused to answer bugle
call until these little matters of domestic economy
are satisfactorily arranged. They are eager to
bleed for their country, but it must be in new
uniforms. Their right hands are burning to bran-
dish the sabre In the face of the foe; but, at the
same time, their left hands are itching to hold
the last six months’ salary. This is just how things
stand at present, owing to unsa'isfactory adminis-
tration. And a very funny state of things it is—
nay, more, ’tis a somewhat alarming state of things.
You see, an army that is liable to go on strike in
time of peace is hardly to be trusted in time of
war. Our Victorian warriors might develop a
fancy for chopping wood at the very moment
they were called upon to chop off the heads of the
perfidious Fr but, stay; the recidivist© question
may yot be amicably settled, so we must dissemble.
District Court Judge Forbes sentenced an
Indecent assaulter the other day to twelve months
and 35 lashes, with the remark that though
the terra of imprisonment was short, the lashes
would make prisoner remember his particularly
gross and brutal crime. An hour or so subse-
quently, prisoner’s solicitor requested his Honor
to remit the 35 lashes, and Forbes consented so to
do. Forbes was quite right—since it is never too
late to mend, even a bad sentence, such as the
original sentence undoubtedly was. But think of
the judicial inconsistency of the thing! With a
light heart a Judge orders a prisoner to be Hogged,
and then, a little while after, being specially
moved thereto by request of counsel (and perhaps
by a good lunch), remits the sentence. This is in
reality, though, sentencing by whim, not reflec-
tion. Where reflection so follows the whim as to
allow of the latter’s correction in time to prevent
the degradation of Justice, it is all right; but In a
great number of cases we fear that the whim is
acted upon—triangles and cat put into actual
requisition—before tho reflection begins to dawn,
when, of course, it is too late to whip the cat.
An Adelaide man, cursed with a consci-
ence, has sent a “fiver” to the S A. Treasurer,
accompanied by a polite little note, stating that
the money “belonged to "the Government.” This
shows great weakness on the part of the Adelaide
man, but, of coursj, the greatest among us are
subject to tits of mental aberration. Even the
“first murderer” in “Richard HI.” admitted to
having suffered from conscience. “ It once made
me return a purse, which perchance I’d —found,”
said tho gentleman engaged to dispose of the
Duke of Clarence, so the South Australian can
proudly point to a Shakespearian precedent for
his recent act. Yet we sincerely hope that this
new disease won’t spread to the other colonies,
because, if everyone were to start on returning all
moneys that honestly belonged to the Govern-
ment, hundreds of our most respectable families
would be plunged into destitution. Suppose, for
Instance, our Civil Servants became troubled in
their minds about unearned salaries—but we will
not not contemplate such social chaos. After all,
there are good grounds for believing that the case
of the Adelaide man is an isolated one, for it ap-
pears that—vide Press—“the last time a similar
event occurred was several years ago.”
In America, there are often “mock wed-
dings” at “church sociables;” and now we see
that, the other day, at a Dundee Sunday-school
picnic, three couples were married “ in joke ” by a
minister. The idea was suggested when they were
In the railway carriage, and so enthusiastically
was the matter pressed that the minister could not
escape performing the mock ceremony. Throe of
the young men then chose their partners, and the
ceremony was carried through in the orthodox
fashion, the minister, in concluding, gravely de-
claring the parties to be legally married, and re-
minding them of the relative duties of husband
and wife. The parties are now in a terrible state
of perplexity, and are taking legal advice as to
their real position; for it has been hinted to them
that by the law of Scotland tfiey arc really mar-
ried, all of them being of age. and having gone
through the marriage ceremony and declared their
acceptance as Husband and wife in the presence of
witnesses. It is some consolation to know that
some of them are sincerely hopeful that this is the
case; but it is reported that the others are not so
well pleased with their haphazard choice, and wish
It were otherwise. Which reminds us that at
Sunday-school and other picnics in Sydney, people
sometimes get married ” in joke,” and, moreover,
quite independently of the minister.
Public confidence in the railway refresh-
ment-room ham-sandwich has been considerably
undermined even In Victoria, where they pay—
don’t laugh-£300 a year to a lot of played-out
politicians who have been appointed “inspectors
of railway refreshment-rooms.” These individuals
have nothing to do but to travel free in the rail-
ways, and sample the liquor and “grub” as they
pass each station, it is supposed that the inspec-
torship has been conferred in each case as a sola-
tium for the loss (or non-acquirement) of a place
in the Legislature, where each member likewise
gets £300 a year, and the run of his teeth on cheap
comestibles in the Parliamentary refreshment-
rooms. But we were about to refer to the ham-
sandwich. The fact that bread is often made with
Hour containing alum, lime, and other minerals,
first excited suspicions, which later revelations as
to the nature and wide use of oleomargarine en-
hanced. The vague alarm was aroused by the dis-
covery that trichinosis was often acquired by eat-
ing the tender ham. Now comes the startling an-
nouncement that the mustard of commerce is
often adulterated with naphthal yellow, which is
not only a poison but a dangerous explosive. The
case against the sandwich is, therefore, now com-
plete. Having forfeited all claims to popular
trust and affection, it should be consigned to the
realms of Orsini bombs, Infernal machines, and
other devices of conspirators.
Sunday School Superintendent Edged
dropped doVn dead in the schoolroom on the
afternoon of Sunday, the 30th ult. In the Salva-
tion Cyrus, on the following Saturday, appeared
an in memoriam notice of tne defunct Eugell so
inconceivably mawkish and tract-ish in some of its
sentences as to deserve a shy at. w e are told, for
Instance, that “ the children of the school were
engaged in service of song. Their Superintendent
had given out the verse—
‘ Whither, pilgrims, are you going ?
Going each with staff in hand ?
Going to a better country;
Going at the King’s command.
While they were singing the .last lino the ‘Kings
command,’ was issued. Mr. Edgell suddenly tell
forward. His happy spirit had heard the sum-
mons, and obeyed it without a moments hesita-
tion The time, place, and employment at the
moment of death ought to mitigate the sorrow
naturally felt at his sudden and unexpected de-
parture. It seems as if the circumstances
of his death were to be noted and under-
stood by bis surviving Inends as the visi-
ble seal of the Divine approbation on a
truly consistent life.” Now, “ obeyed it without a
moment’s hesitation" is simply rot. Could the
Greatest scoundrel unhung offer hesitation when
fieath has got him In his clutch ? And what a
mean, narrow, priggish idea, to regard the tem-
poral manner of the good man’s taking away as
“the visible seal of the Divine approbation on a truly
life Had he died while at breakfast,
w i e lacing his boots, or while parting his back
hair, would it have been right to regardI theTrivi-
ality of the attendant circumstances ot his death-
second as the visible seal .of the Divine disappro-
bation of his lite (which would have been m the
one case as the other, equally truly consist.nt —
if truly consistent, indeed) ? The publication of
this sort of superstitious twaddle is the work of
the tract fashioner, not of the newspaper man.
The following, cut from the Watchman,
a Wexford paper, has about it a strong smack of
Thadeus O’Kane: —“Our microscopic junior
County member voted, we see, for the last heathen
fad (cremation) in vogue among London Agnostics
and crocheteers, by which coffins will become ob-
solete and grave-yards a superfluity. As far as
concerns himself, It does not much matter whether
Mr. Small is burned or buried. His ashes would
about fill a good sized snuff-box, and if he prefers
cremation to a decent wake and burial, we don’t
wish to balk him. Only don’t let him speak for
Wexfordmen in the matter.”
“If. in sweetening your coffee,” says M.
Sauvageon, “you allow the sugar to dissolve
without stirring the liquid, the globules of aircon-
tained In the sugar will rise to the surface of the
liquid. If these globules form a frothy mass, re-
maining in the centre of the cup, it is an indica-
tion of duration of fine weather; if, on the con-
trary, the froth forms a ring round the sides of the
cup, It is a sign of heavy rain; variable weather is
implied by the froth remaining stationary, but not
exactly in the centre.” To these remarks of the
French savant may be added this, that If, when
sweetening your coffee, you discover a more than
ordinary whack of sand in your sugar, it is a sign
you should go for your grocer tout en sweet.
From the Rum “ Edmund Burke, at the
end of a speech upon the atrocities which might
be expected from the French in case of an inva-
sion, drew forth an enormous two-edged dagger
and exclaiming, ‘This is the weapon which win
he pointed at your throats and mine!’ dashed it
on the floor with a tragic gesture. Shortly after-
wards, Lord Cairns, speaking against Burke (who
was suspected of having amassed his wealth dis-
honestly), exclaimed, ‘And this is the weapon
which is used with fatal effect against you and me,’
dragging out, with Burke's gesture, a £5-note.”
Great Scott! why Cairnst Our unfortunate con-
temporary was evidently over the way once too
often the day it committed such an anachronism
on Garmoyle’s papa (whose younger title of baron
only dates from ’67), and mixed up so inextricably
the incidents of British and Rum’uu history. The
admirers of the Rum—there are a few such eccen-
trics, it is darkly rumoured—should subscribe,
and buy for the object of their regard a pair of in-
telligent scissors.
The Methodist Spectator, a paper about
the size of a porous plaster, published in Mel-
bourne, Is rather rough on Bro. Booth’s blue rib-
bon fad. Tho editor of that serio-comic publica-
tion was drawn out of his shell by what he face-
tiously terms “one of his esteemed country
brethren, who has written, suggesting a distinctive
badge to be worn by all Christians.” This
esteemed brother further suggested that a happy
combination of white and blue would fix up the
average Christian to a nicety. We thought so. too;
hut the rev. editor is running on the other tack.
He points out that the blue and white trade mark
has been already appropriated by the anti-rum
and tobacconists, and, consequently, if It were
adopted as suggested, some of the teetotallers
might bo taken for Christians. That would be sad,
indeed. In fact, that rev. editor is level-headed,
it anything. He says that there Is danger in the
badge business being overdone, and he thinks the
majority of Christians would have strong obleotions
against wearing a distinctive Christian badge, as
many teetotallers refuse to sport Brother
Booth’s trade mark. Our sympathies, however,
are still with that “esteemed country brother.”
It would be a grand thing If we could have the
followers of the lowly Nazarene labelled and
guaranteed with the real Hall mark, so that we’d
know who were the hona fide Christians. As
things are, we have our doubts, for we can hardly
believe those loud-mouthed, canting hypocrites
who infest the public streets and the Domain, and
assert that they are saved, that they are the true
Chrhtians, and that they will occupy the front
seats iu Heaven. Anyhow, should the distinctive
badge be adopted, we have an opinion that a few
yarns of ribbon will go along way especially in
Melbourne.
The Civil Service Bill provides, inter alia,
that a Civil Service Board shall be constituted,
consisting of six members, three of whom are to
be chosen from first class officers of the service—
that is just two too many of the sort, if, indeed,
not three too many. Tne Board should be so con-
stituted as not to be leavened with, much less
swayed by, Civil Service prejudices. By the time
a fellow has worked himself up into the first grade
of a Civil Service, he is about ehockful of official
fads and bias, and on that account about the very
last man who ought to be picked for a billet, the
essential qualifications of a holder of which are
manysidedness, Impartiality, and such a know-
ledge of men nnd things as not one bureaucratic don
out of ten million ever acquired.
Why may not imagination trace the
noble dust of Alexander till. &c,, &c. ? Why
not, indeed, or, for the matter of that, why?
If the bunghole open to a rare liquor, what’s
the odds whose is the dust upon its outside ? This
philosophical reflection was struck out of us as we
perused the obituary notice of one of the last de-
scendants of the perjured race of Royal Stuarts
—of Mistress Charlotte Cameron (nie Stuart), wife
of a Kincardine innkeeper. She traced her descent
in a direct line from the first Baron of Kincardine,
grandson of Robert II. of Scotland. Alter 10 grand
generations', the estates of the Barons of Kincar-
dine passed into the hands of the Gordon clan.
Mrs. Stuart-Cameron’s father was a standard-
bearer under Prince Charlie at the battle of Cullo-
den, and her grand-uncle was the famous Colonel
Roy Stuart, the faithful friend of a faithless Prince.
There is now but one remnant left of this ancient
family—a sister of Mrs. Stuart-Cameron’s, who is a
schoolmistress in Strathspey. ’Tis said she served
good ale and gave good measure. If so, she was
one ot the best ot a deuced bad lot.
The growth of Christian Socialism in the
Church of England is very slow. Naturally so. It
doesn’t pay. On the contrary, no clergyman can
profess the Christianity ot Christ without incur-
ring social ostracism and eccle-iastical esnsure.
Yet it grows. Our readers will find interest in the
following extracts from a sermon delivered by the
Rev. C. L. Marson at Hampstead on Asceusion
Day :—“ Those who really believe In the Ascension
have already ascended with Christ, and with Him
live and reign, the right-band men of the Divine
Love. But how many there are who honour Him
with their lips, but their hearts are far from Him/?
Admiration for Jesus, as a man, earnest love and
desire to Imitate Him, these lead to a belief in His
Divinity, in His Ascension, His apotheosis. A
belief in His Divinity, yes! no empty shibboleth,
no mere repetition of the words ‘God of God, and
Light of Light,’ but an honest attempt to assort
the royalty of that God, and to apply His laws,
and a constant shedding of that light upon pro-
blems of this day and this generation
If you really believe there is a Christ now living
and sitting at the right hand of Divine Love, and
he the real King and Inspirer, who ‘ fills all things,’
yes, and all men, and all women end all places, how
would you treat those, to whom Jesus was a friend,
the publicans and the harlots ? Surely, surely, not
from a lofty height of scorn, but with an earnest
and deeply sympathetic tenderness, with the pity
of the very Christ. I am here to appeal to you for
the London Diocesan Penitentiary, where sixty of
those to whom Jesus was a friend, are taught and
trained, lovingly I hope and believe, to better
things. These some dare to call ‘ lost women,’
though they shall, many of them, enter the king-
dom of Heaven before the Pharisee, who disdains
them. ‘Lost,’ Is any one lost when Christ is
King and at the right hand of the all-ruling
Love? You know, or should know, that in
and about London are eighty thousand prostitutes,
some mere children, one in fourteen of all the
young girls between 14 and 30 years of age, and
alas! I have seen tnem mere nursery children
and yet Christ rules in Heaven ? Is there no
remedy ? Yes, by the Christ we worship, there is!
You are asked to give your money towards this
home for 60. I entreat, I command you to do
more than this. Give some of your time-give
more of your love; struggle, and rest not, for a
better state of society. Do you believe in Christ?
and dare you speak or think lightly of the hideous
and accursed flame pit which is scorching and
slaying His sisters and brothers and yours? Do
you believe that Christ is King ?■ and yet you
dare to ally yourself with the state of Society
that results in this ? Look on these things,
do not turn your cowardly eyes from them—
see how wealth amassed here in unhealthy
splendour, and there drained dry, decoys and
drives Englishwomen — and Englishmen to this
dreadful wrong. Wealth must be better distri-
buted, and can be, for the Lord Is King and His
clarions echo to the four winds, as He rides forth
to the war. Choose you one of these two Lords,
for one of them is ascended unto the right hand of
God. Choose either Mammon and assent to his
hecatombs of human lives, and say your prayers
and praises to him, if he is lord of this world and
he inspires and fills all things; or choose the Son of
Man and worship Him, and cease not nor flinch
from the pain or weariness of the uphill storming
of earth's devil-hold strong-holds, until His will be
done visibly on earth, as In the deep and the height
—on earth as in Heaven.”
“The Marquis of Salisbury will,” says the
Citizen, “in a few days lend to the Health Exhi-
bition a pair of hose worn by Queen Elizabeth.”
“ Exhibition, indeed 1” would be the posthumous
opinion of the maiden Queen at this shockingly
public display of garments it was once her royal
pleasure to conceal from sight. “To what base
uses may we come at last. Imperious Bess, long
dead and turned to clay, Her hose exposed to
while our time away I” It stands upon record that
Her Majesty did not regard the stockings which
she pret erred to wear as good examples of a
“ sanitary ” fabric, but the directors of the Health
Exhibition know better, perhaps. The Earl of
Leicester brought from Paris, as a present to the
Queen, the first stockings of woven silk that had
been seen in England, together with a pair of
gold or gilt gloves, set with pearls, which seem to
have excited more attention at the moment. O
the stockings, Her Majesty repotted that they
were very cold and uncomfortable, but “ mar-
vellously delicate wear,” nnd she was too “ pure
womanly” to allow inconvenience to override
effect. It ia possible that the Hatfield relics belong
to the earlier period when Queen Elizabeth, like
other people of her day, wore tailor-made hose;
but, in either case, the exhibit is interesting.
It is not atall unlikely tbatthe fashion-makers will
catch a hint for new-old eccentricity in
stockings from the display of Queen Elizabeth’s
models. By the way, as the Queen of Spain bas
no legs, we don’t see why the Queen of England,
through the unseemly exhibition of these ancient
hoseu, should be convicted of the possession o c
any. Queen Victoria can’t possibly have any
understanding, to speak of, for she's only foui-
foot eight high, and wticn being photographed she
is always bolstered up to make her look sufficiently
queenly to impress tho vulgar multitude. A lot
of that sort of trickery is done by the ruling
powers, who are fully alive to the value of appear-
ances—which is, perhaps, one of the reasons why
Her Majesty la seen so little by the “common
people.” Here is a further instance of the photo-
graphic diplomacy to which we have alluded.
Nothing looks more absurd than a man osten-
tatiously nursing a baby In public; yet, you see
exposed for sale in hundreds of shops in England,
and, tor the matter of that, in Australia, photos.
wherein vacint-faced irresolute-looking Royal
Princes stand beside chairs, whereon are deposited
bladder-headed royal babies on whom are rested
lovingly the royal hands of their royal fathers.
“ One touch of nature,” you know, “ makes
the whole world kin.” Bill Jones, the file-
cutter. who is earning 30s. a week by work-
ing 15 hours a day, and getting his lungs filled
up with steel-dust, looks at tho photo. Bill
has si taby at the room tie calls his home. Though
he isn't so hign up ns to have an axe to grind with
his infant, he is in the habit of nursing it in public.
The i>uke of ccnwulensanfenstein, who Inals on
the Bill Joneses of England to the extent of thou-
sands a year, nursep a baby, docs he? Web, then,
as Bill Jones, the file-cutter, also nurses a baby,
tho Prince can’t be such a bad sort of fellow, after
all. There is, apparently, nothing else in common
between His Royal Highness, who, when born of
his mother, was not a “sou” but a Prince, and
the toiling Bill Jones. There is nothing in their
education, or in their lives. There is hardly any-
thing in their deaths, for that grossly extravagant
military pageant to mark the committal to earth
of him who was no soldier and who came not of a
race of warriors, serves but to remind the more
reflective of the Bill Joneses of England of their
own miserable inheritance of unrewarded toil.
Bill Jones may yet see the real use of the bladder-
headed baby. Bill works and supports his baby.
The other fellow doesn’t.

The accompanying illustration shows a quaint and
stylish dress cap, for the benefit oi those young
married ladies who favour the same. The ground
work is of velvet, in any colour, and richly em-
broidered with fine gold thread, which is sewn on
only along the contours with wide worked stitches
of yellow silk. Gold lace, % of an inch wide, fulled a
little, trims the edge, and bn the crown an agraffe of
ribbon velvet gives a nice finish.
Tho above picture represents a black lace pelerine, gathered into a neck band; it falls
like a cape on the shoulders. The front is cut into long ends, tied at intervals with
bows of narrow ribbon.
