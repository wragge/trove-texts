C.I.G. is oxygen...
the breath of life
Fast action. It takes fast action to save life...in
accidents, electrocution, shock, heart attack,
suffocation, gas poisoning. ...In hospitals, ambu-
lances, first-aid posts. And on our beaches where
summer days bring near-drowning... That action
is Oxygen gently forced into the victim's lungs
to restart or strengthen breathing. Oxygen must
always be ready for fast action. C.l.G.'s Medical
Division sees that it is. C.I.G. makes certain that it
is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.
And equipment: from the small but now world-
famous "Air-Viva", up through a wide range of
resuscitation and respiration units.
In fact C.1.G., one of the world's leaders in this field,
manufactures, supplies and services practically
all equipment of this nature used in Australia.
m
j
The Air-Viva specifically designed to give instant resuscitation in all
cases of respiratory failure. This unit can be used successfully even by an
unskilled person who carefully follows the simple instructions printed in-
side its carrying case. Uses atmospheric air, functions anywhere, any-
time. Oxygen can be introduced without interrupting the breathing cycle.

Six good reasons why you
should own a Rover
1. Rover is a very lively machine. Driv-
ing in city traffic is deceptively smooth
and docile. But Rover has great re-
serves of power. Top speed is more
than 100 mph. The three-litre motor
develops 129 horsepower-you cruise
at 80 all day. Overdrive is standard
equipment. You may choose between
a fully automatic transmission or a
more sporting four-speed synchromesh
handshift.
2. Rover is exceedingly comfortable.
The lack of fatigue over long distances
is quite remarkable. You relax in fully
adjustable seats deeply upholstered in
hides of the finest English leather. The
spaciousness, thick pile carpeting and
luxury appointments add to your com-
fort and pleasure. Door arm-rests also
adjust to suit your fancy. Noise and
vibration rarely intrude, even at high
speeds.
3. Rover’s attention to finish is a mat-
ter of record. The paintwork, for in-
stance, is sprayed with five hand-
rubbed coats of special enamel. Hand-
polished African cherry is inlaid on
fascia and window trims. The simple
classic lines change very little from
year to year. (An international gold
medal has been awarded for coach-
work.)
4. Rover is also a very safe car. Big
servo-assisted disc and shoe brakes
need only a touch to dissolve even the
highest speeds. Safety padding, wind-
screen washers and tamper-proof locks
all add to your feeling of well-being.
Vision is excellent. A superbly engin-
eered suspension gives you the kind
of smooth road-holding and handling
you’d expect from the men who de-
signed and produced the gas-turbine
cars.
5. An air of quiet luxury is to be found
throughout the entire car. Heating and
demisting equipment is built-in. You’ll
also find a courtesy light above each
door. Two-level ventilation for each
person. There’s even a hidden nest of
tools. A reserve fuel supply. And a
switch to tell you the oil level in the
motor. Sound absorbing underlays,
rubber body mounts, and thick under-
body sealing keep out dust and ex-
traneous noise.
6. Parts and service are not expensive.
A network of,specially chosen dealers
will do everything to keep you happy
with your Rover-long after you’ve
bought it. Rover has earned a reputa-
tion for being one of the best engin-
eered motor cars in the world. It is
designed to be driven and enjoyed
long after many ordinary cars have
been discarded. Your investment will
in fact cost less to maintain than most
others, regardless of price.
There are many more exciting aspects
to this fine car. If you would like
the pleasant experience of discovering
them for yourself, please write or tele-
phone. We’ll send a Rover to your door.

National Notebook
Virtuoso
'T'he concerts given by Indian musician
Ravi Shankar in Sydney last week
under the somewhat unexpected spon-
sorship of the ABC were so highly
successful that an additional concert had
to be arranged at short notice. Shankar’s
concerts attracted many musicians and
music students anxious to get first-hand
experience of Indian music, jazz buffs
and a full quota of those hair-shirted
individuals gloomily celebrating the
decline of the West.
Mr Shankar, away from his sitar,
was approached with equal reverence.
One columnist reported that Mr Shankar
had spent 14 hours a day for six years
learning his instrument. It might just as
easily have been six hours a day for 14
years. Give or take a few hours or
years, it is, as Mr Shankar would agree,
about the same time that any Western
virtuoso spends learning his instrument.
Mr Shankar told us that he left India
when he was nine to join his brother,
Uday, also a sitarist, in Paris. There
he met and performed for Casals, Segovia
and Paderewski. He returned to India
when he was 15 and began to study
under Ustad Allauddin Khan, “a very
old man, over 100 years old”.
Mr Shankar began to tour India as a
soloist and was later appointed musical
director of the Indian National Radio.
He went to Europe where he performed
at the 1963 Edinburgh Festival, and
America.
Mr Shankar has met and talked with
many Western musicians, including
Oistrakh, Menuhin, Britten, Messiaen,
Varese and Boulez. “Every time I meet
a Western composer I ask, ‘Why since
the end of the rococo and baroque era
has improvisation gone from Western
music?’ No one knows the answer.”
Mr Shankar feels that the similarity
between Indian music and jazz is only
superficial. “Jazz musicians,” he told
us, “who justify themselves in any way
they can always try to associate their
art with that of India, which is far from
correct.
Rumor
"Oroken Hill has just seen a classic
example of where ignorance can
lead. But in this case it was ignorance
condoned, if not fostered, by the head-
in-the-sand attitude of local medical
authorities.
For weeks rumors of an outbreak of
venereal disease among young people
swept the city. Chaos threatened at least
one school and thousands would not
attend the swimming pools. Everyone
seemed to have his own idea on how
the disease could be spread.
Then the climax came. In the dark
of night, two men scaled the fence sur-
rounding the city’s main pool and
attacked a helpless cleaner. As the
cleaner was punched to the ground, one
of the men kicked him and screamed:
“My daughter got a- disease from here
. . . we know where it came from.”
Using an iron bar, the men then smashed
a women’s toilet. As they left, they told
the prostrate cleaner: “Keep your mouth
shut.”
It took this act of violence to bring
the medical authorities to their senses.
They rushed to the Press with state-
ments declaring that you could not
contract the disease in any way but
through sexual intercourse.
But it was then too late. The out-
break had become headline news, al-
though it appears that only five young
people were involved. It was a situation
that should never have occurred; and
might not have but for the attitude of
the medical authorities.
For weeks at least one local journalist
had been making himself unpopular try-
ing to convince the authorities that public
disquiet was such that a public state-
ment was warranted. Instead the
authorities brought pressure to bear to
see that nothing got in the papers. Even
a statement issued by the Director of
Public Health iff NSW, Dr C. J. Cum-
mins, saying that there was no cause
for concern, was vetoed.
The City Council has now declared
that it would prosecute to the fullest
extent the men who broke into the baths.
Thus the police began hunting the men
like common criminals. If caught, their
names will become public, identifying
their families with the disease. All
because medical men refused to see the
dangers in ignorance.
Sporting Life
r I ''he Moscow Torpedos have been
playing clean, fast, sportsmanlike
soccer during their Australian tour.
However, their visit has been somewhat
less successful socially.
None of the team speaks any English.
The officials who surround the team, in
the ratio of about one official to every
two players, have refused to allow any
interpreters except those who came with
the team. W. D and H. O. Wills, who
have sponsored the visit, sent a Russian-
speaking Yugoslav employee to Perth to
join the team. The Russians demanded
that this interpreter be withdrawn, lest, it
seems, any except the official version of
what is being said around them reaches
the team.
Officials of the Moscow team
announced at the outset that they did
not want the team to attend any social
functions. The NSW branch of the
Soccer Federation, however, declined to
cancel a dinner which had already been
arranged. This turned out to be a
"When we want the opinion of the man in the street we'll ask for it."

gloomy affair. Nobody arrived until an
hour after the stipulated time. Then
the team came, minus officials, at 8
p.m. The team and local soccer people
with no language in common sat
through a silent meal. At 9.30 the Rus-
sian officials arrived and, declining food,
moved straight into the programme of
speeches.
The team are all members of the
Automobile Workers’ Union and are
officially employed at a Moscow car-
works, although, in fact, they are full-
time socqer players. This is Russia’s way
of preserving amateurism in sport,
which, in fact, is not entirely unlike
our own.
Gloomy Austrians
“Why do they always talk about
Austrians as gay people?” de-
manded Dr Alois Reitbauer, Austria’s
new Ambassador. “Recently I heard a
report on the ABC. A Viennese girl had
migrated here. Reporters had asked her
why. ‘Because I heard about your high
standard of loving,’ she told them. Of
course she meant ‘living’, but the re-
porter remarked: ‘Ah, those gay Aus-
trians!’ Let me assure you most Aus-
trians are grumblers. I’m certainly a
grumbler.”
Dr Reitbauer, himself from Vienna,
is his country’s first Ambassador to
Canberra and he is holding his first
ambassadorial post. He was talking to
us on his first official visit to Sydney.
“My reactions to Australia? Well, I’ve
spent the last few months settling in.
Everything is so different here. The
countryside is burnt and parched. It
makes for very pretty colors. My interests
are in music and theatre.” He paused.
“My wife and I have brought a big
record collection and a lot of books.
“I find your politicians most eloquent.”
We looked startled, but he held up a
hand, “No, they are very eloquent in-
deed. The standards of debate here are
very high. I find it fascinating to be
in a country so bound up with the
future of South-East Asia and all the
things that are going on there. My last
post was as Consul-General in Zurich.
Very different.
“Also it is interesting to see your
migrant society. So many people who
are still of Europe, while their children
are completely Australian. You must
remember that no other country in the
world offers examples of such an ex-
periment' actually in process.”
The Ambassador said he found our
Press standards generally high. “Only
do remember that our bitter history and
our present geographical position are

not conducive to gaiety. Nor is it
correct to refer to us as an example
of a small country holding to neutrality.
We most certainly are not neutral in
the face of any enemies of democracy.
We have tasted the effects of the Ans-
chluss and ten years of occupation.
We realise now that we must stand on
our own and despite our position
geographically, placed between two ways
of life, we must sink political differences
for the sake of unity and strength. We
are not permitted the concept of gov-
ernment and opposition parties. Our
conservative party and our labor party
govern jointly. It is better that way.
“I think the Swiss idea is a good
one. There every political party of any
consequence is given a position in the
government. Opposition politics are a
luxury of happier-placed nations.”
On the Air
Otormed at by shot and shed for
his plea for ALP-DLP talks, an
unperturbed Senator Pat Kennedy is
in the thick of another ALP fight—
for control of the Melbourne radio
station 3KZ. He is one of the
three trustees in whose hands lies the
station’s future. The 3KZ licence was
granted to Labor by the Scudin Govern-
ment in depression days. As a quid pro
quo the Liberal Party got 3XY.
With the ALP and unions in 1930
near bankrupt and unable financially to
set up the station, the 3KZ licence was
leased to a private advertising firm,
which has managed it efficiently and
regularly secured renewal of the lease
from the trustees. Twice before, power-
ful moves for the ALP and Trades Hall
to end the lease and take over have
failed. The last was at the time of the
Labor split in 1955. The Left defeated
the move on the ground that control of
the station would strengthen the Right
wing and the “groupers”.
Now, ironically, the positions are re-
versed. The Left-wing Victorian exe-
cutive wants control, the Right opposes
for similar reasons to the Left in ’55.
Kennedy and his fellow trustees are un-
der heavy ALP pressure to hand over
the lease to the Party. The Wangaratta
Country Conference sought to call for
a “hand over” but was prevented when
State President Bob Holt ruled them out
of order.
Moderate opinion at Melbourne
Trades Hall is that it would be a bad
move to hand over the station to con-
trol of one faction at a time when
Labor and the unions are divided and
the divisions could affect its prestige and
effective management. The betting is
that a majority of the three trustees will
vote to renew the lease to the private
firm. If they do, Kennedy will face
another storm.
THE RUSSIAN THREAT
ffij^ulCetCci
80 Years Ago: March 21, 1885
fact that the members of the
Government have been devoting
consideration to the subject of the de-
fence of the colony against possible
aggression is satisfactory. The posi-
tion of the colony is very much less
so. It appears that, because of the
rash and unnecessary dispatch of a
portion of our defence forces to the
Soudan, our magazines have been so
depleted of munitions of war that a
fresh supply has had to be sent for;
this is a very serious matter, should
war be announced, or even should it
not be announced, our condition
would be seriously compromised,
were there any short-coming in the
materials for effective defence.
One thing is very certain; if an
expedition against Australian colonies
has formed portion of her plan of
operations, Russia will not have de-
signed that expedition to reach here
only by the time that England, fully
warned, shall have reinforced the
paltry squadron at present in Austra-
lian waters. If the blow is to come
at all, it should be expected almost
simultaneously with the commence-
ment of hostilities. It would not, in
fact, be unreasonable to reckon that
the commencement of hostilities may
be this very blow, and that Sydney
may serve as the Alexandria of the
Russians.
It would be not more than wisdom
were our batteries manned, and our
torpedoes laid at once. One thing, at
least, is positively certain; that if
war is to be declared, and Russia
means to deal a blow at Australia,
her commander will not have the
decent civility to wait until Mr Dai-
ley has been enabled to refill the
magazines he has depleted, with
cartridges and other ammunition. If
the Ministry will put this Soudan fad
out of their heads, and resolutely face
the really serious business ahead, and
if advantage be not at once taken
of the present disorganised condition
of our defence forces, the colony will
speedily be in a condition to give a
very warm reception to any foreign
invaders who may swoop upon us
with the professed intention of in-
troducing “good government”, or
under other hypocritical pretence.

Fighting Fire with Fire
HThere can have been few worse fort-
A nights in our history of natural
disasters than the last one. The huge
bushfires in Victoria and New South
Wales took 14 lives and devastated
countless homes and farms. Every
morning we read of fresh horror, and
every evening television showed it to
us.
Yet, however disastrous the fires
were, there was a familiar air about
them all. What was so different in
1965 from what happened in the Dan-
denongs in 1962, or in the Blue
Mountains in 1957, or on all the other
“Black Fridays” or “Tragic Mondays”
of Australian history? Australians
have been repeating the warnings to
themselves regularly with each new
bushfire disaster burning the menace
deeper into the national experience.
There it seems to have stuck.
Reaction to the fires seems as weak
and predictable as the fires are fierce
and unpredictable. There are appeals
by the State premiers for Federal
relief, there is public praise for the
courage and sacrifice of the fire-
fighters, and moralistic admonition of
careless cigarette smokers or campers
who have lit fires in the open. Com-
munities rally to help people rebuild
their homes and re-stock their farms,
only to read one year or five years
later that the same disaster has befallen
other communities fifty miles away.
What is needed is a complete re-
thinking of the nature of the bushfire
danger by the scientists who have
worked in the field and by the fire-
fighting authorities. But there must
be a shift in the emphasis from the
techniques of fighting bushfires once
they start to fire prevention. Neither
Victoria nor New South Wales, for
instance, has one body which co-
ordinates all bushfire research, pre-
vention and control. Since the cost
to the States every time there is a fort-
night like the last one is in the millions,
an expenditure of at least the amount
now available for bushfire relief
(£lOO,OOO in NSW) and the setting
up of such a co-ordinating body
would be a reasonable start to finding
radical solutions.
Alone among the States, Western
Australia has taken this view. It has
used a controversial technique of fire
prevention with some success. Each
year under a system of planned and
controlled area-burning, one million
acres of the four million acre jarrah
pine forest is systematically burnt.
Every four years the cycle is repeated.
The result has been that in that State
the summer fire hazard is decreasing
appreciably.
The theory behind this approach
has been summarised by a former
CSJIRO scientist and authority on fire-
fighting, Dr Alan King, in a paper pre-
pared in 1963. Dr King claims that
European colonization of Australia
has brought about a change in the
nature of the forest and has reduced
the area of forest burned annually.
But it also produced more severe and
damaging bushfires because the prac-
tice of decreasing the area burnt out
each year allows both the living and
dead fuels to build up until they are so
concentrated that fires are disastrously
violent, killing or severely damaging
even the largest trees and “paving the
way for the development of an even
more dangerous fuel type”,
The eastern States have been re-
luctant to follow the purposeful area-
burning of Western Australia, although
if is. a technique as readily adaptable
to eucalyptus forests as it is to other
types of forest. Yet in view of the
recent outbreaks this is at least one
approach worth investigating seriously,
What is most important is that it
would be the start of a more scientific
way of looking at prevention and fire
control instead of trying to deal with
the problem at the level of relief and
rehabilitation after the fire has struck.
Living on Borrowed Time
TI/hen Professor Sibnarayan Ray sub-
mitted his article on the Aus-
tralian wheat gift to India (this issue,
page 46), he suggested to The Bul-
letin that perhaps it would not be
fitting for him to sign it, since it con-
tained criticisms of the Australian
Government and he is, after all, a
foreign guest in this country. But he
left the decision whether or not to
use his name to The Bulletin.
The Bulletin had no hesitation in
deciding to use his name, partly be-
cause it feels that Indians and Aus-
tralians are sufficiently close for us
not to have to bother about standing
on ceremony, and partly because what
he has to say may carry more weight
when signed by a prominent Indian
name.
The basic point in his important
article is that the Australian wheat
gift to India, however timely and
generous, will be a wasted gesture
unless it is followed up by closer
political, economic and strategical
collaboration between our two coun-
tries in the face of the common threat
from Red China.
Professor Ray is openly critical of
his own government’s post-indepen-
dence policies. Even when it had
awakened from its dream of non-
alignment, its resources were in-
adequate for both defence and feeding
its huge and half-starved population.
Therefore, for the next crucial ten
years, it will have to depend heavily
on international assistance from coun-
tries like Australia, whose long-range
survival depends as much on the
preservation of India as of South
Vietnam.
Nevertheless, in the face of the
recent famine, both India and Aus-
tralia seemed equally reluctant to co-
operate. Perhaps India’s attitude was
more understandable; it knew that it
could count upon America, and al-
though Australia is geographically
closer, it has been psychologically more
distant and uncertain. Our Govern-
ment, however, ha- less excuse for
hesitation. The only public opposition
to the proposal for a gift of wheat to
India was found in those strange bed-
fellows, the Left-wing and the Wheat
Board. The Government’s reluctance
could only in the end be explained as
a matter of protocol: it wanted the
Indian Government to place a request
before it took any action.
It is trivia and protocol of this kind
which must be overcome if the two
governments are to follow up this
first serious step towards fuller co-
operation. As Professor Ray says: we
are both living on borrowed time.


THIS AUSTRALIA
BUSHFIRES
Fourteen Dead
" Nature can never be taken for granted ”
SYDNEY In the last fortnight
savage heat and searing winds brought
a terrifying reminder to both Victoria
and NSW that nature can never be
taken for granted. Fire burst out in
a hundred places, which roared ahead
on broad fronts to take the lives of 14
people, annihilate a township, to destroy
houses, stock, to scorch and blacken
scores of thousands of square acres of
pasture, orchard and forest lands.
There are still small fires still to be
extinguished, mouths to be fed, forests
to be replanted, fortunes to be restored,
new houses to be built, stock to be
bought and burns to be healed. Now
there remains the task of cleaning up.
Victoria was the harder hit. In Gipps-
land the damage caused by last Wed-
nesday's fire outbreak was estimated at
more than £200,000. This fire which
covered 1500 square miles destroyed 59
houses, 2 woolsheds, 3 hay sheds, miles
of fencing, 181 cattle, 3100 sheep, 3
railway bridges and countless small
buildings.
However, NSW did not escape un-
scathed. Some say its bushfires were
the worst since the disastrous Blue
Mountain fire of December, 1957, when
a series of huge fires swept through
several small towns leaving thousands
of people homeless.
Victoria has a distinction not often
mentioned in tourist literature. In the
words of the State Government’s year
book it is “one of the most fire hazard-
ous areas in the world'’. This summer-
autumn, having made quite a start, is
living up to the State’s reputation. The
death of at least half a dozen people in
fires each year, and the loss of great
values of stock, property, forests and
fencing has become a regular and sea-
sonal fact of local history.
Awareness of fire is part of people’s
mentality and always in the background
is the memory of even greater tragedies.
The fires of 1926 killed 31; 71 died in
1939 and 51 in 1943-44. These are the
measuring sticks of disaster. Country
folk have always known the danger in
NSW and Victoria while the penetration
of urban consciousness is more recent.
Tn Victoria urban peace of mind over
fires came to an end in 1962 when fire
covered most of the Dandenong Ranges
and wide areas just to the north-east of
the city and burned to the outer suburbs.
Eight people died and scores of homes
were razed.
This brought the heat very close and
placed the problem of fire-fighting under
city scrutiny. Since this near debacle
the Victorian Government has been
under considerable pressure to improve
fire-fighting organisation. Yet this
summer has found the State as far from
really effective control as ever. It may
be, of course, that giant fires are just
unquenchable.
The official view is that despite the
propaganda of some overseas fire-
fighting services, particularly in the
mmm"
keep
ter beauty
iatdite
HtiVSNI 1 ill
USA, neither water-from-the-sky nor
chemicals have proved of value yet.
Then again the expenditure to experi-
ment in this fashion could be too ex-
cessive. The Government and indeed
the municipalities have only had mild
success in attempts to make Victorians
more conscious of the fire risk of tall
grass and undergrowth. There are fines
and threats of fines, but the response
has been limited. (Last week a NSW
magistrate fined two men a total of
£270 for lighting grass fires, while
another magistrate gaoled three men for
three months because they lit a fire to
boil their billy during a period of a
total fire ban.)
Possibly part of Judge Stretton's
Royal Commission report of the fires of
1939 should be obligatory breakfast
reading for every New South Welshman
and Victorian every summer:
‘‘Seventy-one lives were lost. Sixty-
BUSHFIRES RAGING SOUTH OF BUNDANOON, NSW.


nine mills w'ere burned. Millions of
acres of fine forest of almost incalcu-
lable value were destroyed or badly
damaged. Townships were obliterated
in a few minutes. Mills, houses,
bridges, tramways, machinery were
burned to the ground; men, cattle,
horses, sheep were devoured by the
fires or asphyxiated by the scorching,
debilitated air . . .”
Scientific research into bushfires has
been conducted for several years by
such organisations as the CSIRO, the
Commonwealth Forestry and Timber
Bureau, the Forests Commission of Vic-
toria, and APM Forests Pty Ltd. A
great deal has been discovered about the
conditions in which fires start and much
time has been spent on inquiry into sur-
vival.
In most fire tragedies, according to
the CSIRO, the people who die are dead
or nearly dead before the flames reach
them. The main peril is not flame but
radiated heat, causing exhaustion and
collapse. Anyone who can shield him-
self from radiation, hold off energy-
wasting panic, and avoid reckless flight
has a much better chance of survival.
This explains the escapes from death
of people who have draped blankets
over themselves and just stood still, or
huddled under the dashboards of motor
vehicles while the windows melted. Even
underneath a vehicle a person is fairly
well shielded. When a house is sur-
rounded by fire, one should close all
doors and windows and stay inside, the
CSIRO advises. “Abandon such places
of concealment only when they are
burning fiercely and conditions in the
hide-out are becoming unbearable. By
this time, with any luck, the surrounding
vegetation will be consumed and the
flames dying down.
“Clothing is a valuable shield. It
should cover as much of the body as
possible. Boiler suits are good, and
woollen material is much to be pre-
ferred. But some cloths of artificial
fibre are poor shields, and melted pieces
can contaminate burns.
“The scientists have also looked into
the results of fatigue on fire-fighting
efficiency. The effects of immoderate
exertion and radiation go hand in hand.
Both are a menace to safety and sur-
vival in fire times,” the CSIRO says. In
fire-fighting, dehydration is also a dan-
ger. Fire-fighters, even though not con-
scious of thirst, should drink more
fluids than usual —of any sort.
The CSIRO, APM and other re-
searchers have investigated the use of
protective goggles, including the use of
demisting agents. Against the smoke
danger, a wet handkerchief over the
mouth and nose is useful. So is a cot-
ton-wool mask held on the face with
elastic straps. More elaborate, heavier
masks are often a nuisance.
CSIRO
The Rainmakers
A possibility rather than a probability
SYDNEY At 10,000 feet the
long, white cloud was tantalisingly
close, and it looked as if all we would
have to do would be to turn our
CSIRO plane slightly to the left, fly
through it, seed it and send hundreds
of thousands of tons of rain washing
down on to the bushfires below. It
seemed as if the pessimistic predic-
tions of our pilot that we would not
find any clouds at all that afternoon
would be proved dramatically wrong.
In fact, the cloud was 250 miles away
to the south, the very clearness of the
hot sky making it seem so close.
I was disappointed. Less so, the
rainmakers. Having flown regularly
in experiments for the last seven years,
they have their own vision to sustain
them when they have to land without
firing a shot, and without causing a
drop of rain to fall.
Last week the vision of Utopia
was a cumulus cloud which would last
long enough, have a deep enough base,
and would be cold enough (-10
degrees centigrade or colder) to
respond to seeding. The supercooled
cloud had to be over a bushfire, it
had to be found, stalked and seeded
at the right time, allowing for the
wind conditions. N When The Bul-
letin flew over the bushfire areas in
New’ South Wales with the rainmakers,
the only clouds that were close enough
were clouds of smoke spiralling up
from the still-burning forests below.
After a week in which two crews
stood by ready to go 24 hours a day,
but could not find one cloud “worth
a crumpet”, the rainmakers were still
cautiously optimistic.
They maintained that the right
cloud was not a remote chance but
a good possibility. In any case, they
pointed out that rainmaking could do
its most effective job if used to lay
down a steady blanket of rain over
the most vulnerable areas to prevent
fires breaking out.
In Gippsland, Victoria, the second
aircraft in the cloud-seeding project
seemed to justify the optimism when
up to half an inch of rain fell within
an hour of the first seeding flights.
The CSIRO has been making rain
since 1947, and as far back as 1953
successfully seeded clouds over a
drought area in northern New South
Wales, bringing welcome relief.
Despite this background, however,
there are still doubts about rain-
making, not the least of them among
the scientists themselves.
The CSIRO rainmakers are usually
two men —one a pilot, the other a
technical officer—flying a Cessna 310
fitted with two generators, one under
each wing and looking like miniature
jet engines. A spark plug sets alight
a solution of acetone and silver iodide
which is sprayed into the generator
and released as a smoky mist in short
bursts as the plane flies through the
clouds chosen for seeding. Using only
one and a half gallons of the silver
iodide solution per hour, 1 the rain-
makers can seed clouds to give rain
over an area of one to two square
miles at its heaviest, with lighter rain
falling over a much wider area.
What is still doubtful, and in a
country of droughts, bushfires and
lack of large water resources in many
areas, crucially doubtful, is whether
the same method works over areas
wide enough to provide worthwhile
increases.
With some pride I had told the
taxi-driver who had brought me to
Mascot that I was going up to bring
rain.
What was clear after our flight,
however, was that relying on the
“magic” of rain-making once bushfires
start was largely to rely on a possi-
bility rather than a probability.
SAM LIPSKI
ALP—I
Labor’s Open War
Hawke and Chamberlain
CANBERRA Theoretically it is
out of NSW that Labor’s political
Lochinvars were to come riding to
rescue the ALP from the paralysing
Left-wing control that, in Senator Pat
Kennedy's words, is reducing Labor to
a “perpetual opposition.” But the NSW
ALP is neither fighting nor riding any-
where. All it wants is to be left alone,
frozen in a defensive attitude, protect-
ing its vested interest in the Renshaw
State Labor Government and prepared


to allow the Left wing to extend its
Federal influence and power unchal-
lenged.
It is out of the west where Labor was
recently defeated in a bid to wrest the
West Australian State Government
from the Liberal-Country Party coali-
tion that a rather lonely Lochinvar is
riding. The Lochinvar is Bert Hawke,
64, WA Labor Parliamentary Leader
and a one-time WA Premier of six years’
standing.
The NSW ALP which has kept a Labor
Government in office for years in NSW
by pleading that it was the source of
Right-wing strength, but in practice
by adopting a “neutralist” attitude that
suited the Left wing far more interested
in Federal than State power, is prepared
to throw Hawke to the Left-wing
Federal ALP wolves. All that it is
praying is that the Left wing will
not eat him before the NSW State elec-
tion on May 1 which would be em-
barrassing and might affect Labor's
NSW electorate prospects. Unhappily
for the NSW ALP, however, Hawke is
giving every indication of a fight.
Hawke has got stuck into F. E.
Chamberlain, WA State Secretary and
Federal “strong man” who has guided
the Leftist forces to successful control
of the Federal machine for years, in no
uncertain fashion. Almost as though
inviting Chamberlain to take him to
court, Hawke has put on record in a
letter to Chamberlain —a letter signed
officially by Hawke in his capacity as
WA Opposition Leader and sent to
Chamberlain in his role as WA ALP
Secretary—a personal assessment of Mr
Chamberlain's attributes which lifted
even my thinning hair.
Chamberlain, whose attitude is that
the Labor Parliamentarian must be kept
subservient to the machine, is blamed
by Hawke for the decision by the WA
State Executive to report Hawke to the
ALP Federal authorities for his tenta-
tive approval of the Kennelly statement
advocating a round table conference
between the ALP and the Democratic
Labor Party to secure a united Labor
Party. ,
Hawke has declared open war on
Chamberlain, and has widened the fight
by alleging that Chamberlain has
through the years made statements
which were “most unwise, unduly pro-
vocative, and seriously inimical to unity
within the Labor movement.” Cham-
berlain’s strength so far has been that he
has dominated the WA ALP machine.
There have been ripples of rebellion
—an unsuccessful ticket was run against
his nominees at the last WA ALP elec-
tion of officers —but he has been able to
crush them before they gathered any
real momentum. From his secure base
in WA he has been able to range and
establish his power Federally. He has
done much of the thinking and planning
at ALP Federal executives and confer-
ences for the Left-wing ALP States of
Victoria and Queensland and with their
backing intimidated NSW into its in-
effective policy of “neutralism”.
He still, apparently, retains his grip
on the WA ALP machine. Otherwise
the referring of Hawke to the ALP
Federal executive where Chamberlain is
a very significant figure would not have
gone through. But Hawke is a very
different opponent from any WA oppo-
sition Chamberlain has had to confront
so far.
Accepting the Kennelly thesis that
unless the ALP reforms its house it is
doomed to perpetual opposition,
Hawke's hands are unfettered. He has
just been re-elected leader of the WA
Labor Parliamentary Party, which means
he has a following in the executive. He
is widely respected by the voting public
which put him in as Premier for six
years. He has links running across Aus-
tralia, connecting him with figures like
Kennelly and others in the Federal
caucus as well as State Parliamentarians
and Right-wing ALP groups.
If Chamberlain moves out of the
Federal scene, the repercussions will be
enormous. The Left wing will be de-
prived of its ablest and most determined
mind, and anything could happen. The
only trouble for Hawke is that he wilt
ride almost alone.. The NSW contin-
gent will be cautiously sheltering at
home defending what has become more
important to them than any ideological
struggle—the Renshaw Labor Govern-
ment to which they have clung with
frantic preoccupation while the Left
wing has entrenched itself Federally.

ALP—II
Go Left
Whitlam’s future in doubt?
MELBOURNE During the 1955
Labor “split” the late Eddie Ward is re-
puted to have offered, from the fruits
of years of experience in riding out
NSW political storms, to each of his
perturbed Federal Parliamentary col-
leagues a personal survival kit. The kit
F. E. CHAMBERLAIN
consisted of five words, “When in doubt,
go Left.” The question being asked in
ALP circles during the last week was
whether Gough Whitlam’s TV “Meet
the Press” interview on his return from
South-East Asia was a bid for survival.
Mr Whitlam went Left.
He declared himself well to the Left
of Party Leader Calwell, and in tune
ideologically with Dr Cairns; he called
for recognition of Red China’s right to
the same dominance in South-East Asia
as the United States in the Caribbean.
He damned the DLP and all its works.
As Mr Whitlam asked “Meet the
Press” well before his return to arrange
the engagement, these must be regarded
as considered statements and in no way
off the cuff. Being made in Senator
Kennelly’s home State, they were ac-
cepted as a repudiation of the Kennelly
campaign for DLP talks. But in the
eyes of many ALP Right-wingers they
went further. They were an indication
that Whitlam might listen to Left-wing
proposals for a Whitlam-Cairns ALP
leadership. Right-wingers noted that
Whitlam returned from Singapore to
Australia via Perth, where Mr F. E.
Chamberlain resides.
A Whitlam-Cairns alliance would
■have explosive effects on ALP align-
ments. It would spell early removal for
leader A. Calwell, who has depended
on the Left and has therefore cultivated
Cairns. It could grease the skids for
Senate leader Nick McKenna and
deputy-leader Pat Kennedy, hitherto
regarded as Whitlam men. It would in-
furiate Tom Doherty and the AWU, to
whom Cairns is anathema because of his
support for Pat Mackie. But it would
have the powerful support of the Left-
wing unions and the Party machines in
at least four States —Queensland, WA,
SA and Victoria.
These four machines could be relied
on to ensure acceptance by Federal Par-
liamentarians from their States. Their
selections would depend on acquiescence.
It would be different with the Australian
electors. The Whitlam “Move Left'’
came at a time when he seemed assured
of ALP leadership. Now' his future
must be in doubt. He broke with the
Calw'ell forces after the 1963 election;
now he has broken with McKenna and
Kennellly. He could never trust the
Left, which dislikes him and is com-
mitted to Cairns. Renshaw' and the
NSW Right will certainly not thank him
for w'hat he has done just prior to their
State election. It seems that the Right
wing will look for another prospective
leader. Its trouble will be to find one.

MOUNT ISA
“Where His
Mates Are”
Mackie’s days are numbered
, MOUNT ISA The days of power
here for Pat Mackie, the Committee for
Membership Control, and his “rebel
miners” seem numbered because there
are definite signs that the seven months-
long dispute will end within 4 or 5
weeks. One reason for this belief is
that AWU miners are returning to work
at the rate of 40 a week. Another is
that the Queensland Trades and Labor
Council is believed to only have enough
finance in hand to continue paying strike
aid to miners for another month.
The rate of strike pay at present is
£BOOO a week, or £32,000 a month, and
no group of unions can keep up this
rate of payment indefinitely. Last week
the Mt Isa Trades and Labor Council
decided that some of the work miners
would not be paid because they had
gone to centres like Townsville and
Mackay to work, while at the same time
their wives were picking up strike aid
here. The fact that this type of miner
and his wife were only interested in the
money angle—and not the strike—came
as a rude shock to the Left-wing
Queensland Trades and Labor Council.
TJicket numbers outside the mine gates
A have, also been dwindling. To Friday
last week more than 520 men had re-
ported back to work and of these an
estimated 250 were AWU members.
There are an estimated 450 to 500 AWU
members refusing to work here so the
AWU is biding its time and as soon as
another 150 men go back to work the
union is expected to immediately call a
mass meeting. Such meeting would, it
seems there is little doubt, vote for com-
plete return to work. One thing which is
acting as an irresistible magnet to the
striking miners is £lO a day contracts
being waved by Mt Isa Mines Ltd. And
besides only the most dedicated of the
miners do not feel that the dispute is
lost.
Mt Isa Mines Ltd, even though it is
losing income at the rate of £1 million a
week, has made it clear that under no
circumstances will Pat Mackie be reinsta-
ted. It has been obvious here for several
days that the town is turning against
Mackie. Even Mackie’s most avid sup-
porters early in the dispute realise now
that nothing can be gained by keeping
the trouble going; and the townspeople
are at last realising that there is a strong
Communist influence in the dispute.
Mackie himself is not as jocular as he
has been. Action by police last week
also would not have exactly helped his
frame of mind when first he was
ordered from the mine lease by police
after he drove his car over to where the
miners change their clothes before going
underground. (The police have been
keeping all pickets off the mine lease.)
Then the police gave him a parking
ticket when he left his rented car in a
loading bay outside the post office.
Previously police had ignored Mackie
when he illegally parked his car outside
the Star Theatre here when speaking to
mass meetings. Late last week Mackie
parked his car outside Saint Joseph’s
Roman Catholic school before walking
across to speak to some of his pickets.
The police told him to park the car
elsewhere because parents needed the
area to let their children out of their
cars. Mackie was reported to have
fired back a reply at police which led
to him being spoken to again. All these
things point at Mackie’s decline from
power. As the wife of one underground
worker who has returned to the mine
said, “It took my husband a while to
realise it —but the dispute is out of hand.
However, all this intimidation made him
frightened about going back earlier and
also he did not want to let his mates
down. He reckons he knows where
his mates are now —right over there in
the mine.”
HOSPITAL
The Nurses’
Revolt
No more Florence Nightingales
MELBOURNE Victorian nurses,
long the least militant of any branch of
the medical and hospital professions,
are at last taking steps to improve their
own lot. The Royal Victorian College of
Nurses is continuing a campaign for
a “realistic” salary although the State
Wages Board has already rejected initial
claims. The claim for a “realistic”
salary revolves around the changed
nature of the nursing profession; about
75 per cent of trained nurses now live
away from the hospital.
At present, a charge of £3 6s. 3d. per
week is deducted for board from nurses
who live at a nurses’ home attached to
the hospital. The nurses’ representatives
argue that this figure is only about half
of the actual value of the board, and
that the many nurses who live out are
denied this hidden subsidy. Their claim
asks for a flat increase in all trained
nurses’ salaries of £4 7s. 6d. per week
and suggests that the charge for “living
in” be raised to £7 10s. weekly. The
claim is not directed to raising the value
placed on nurses’ work. It aims only to
bring present - day salaries for nurses
who live outside hospitals to the same
actual level as for those who live in.
This claim has so far been refused by
the State Wages Board. The employer
organisations opposed the claim on the
grounds that such a revision of the
salary structure would result in an im-
mediate increase of £1 million in the
wages bill. They also feared that such
a rise would lead to wage claims by
other hospital employees. The Hospital
and Charities Commission gave evidence
which implied that further encourage-
ment of trained nurses to live out would
waste the £2£ million spent in the last
five years on nurses’ homes. Nurses claim
this latter argument is specious, because
about 90 per cent of this accommoda-
tion is for student nurses, who would
continue to “live in” anyw'ay. Ulti-
mately, the claim was rejected because
the Wages Board was not convinced that
the “hidden subsidy’’ had been used to
depress nurses’ salaries in the past.
The claim for a readjustment of
salaries is only one aspect of the new
move for reform which is gaining
ground within the nursing profession
throughout Australia, and which may
help to change the present depressed
status of the profession.
If the present claims in Victoria are
not granted soon, many nurses are warn-
ing that the prospect of militant indus-
trial action may not be as remote
as hospital administrators comfortably
believe.

The resignation of Max Newton
CANBERRA Rumored for some
time, the first hard news many staff
members of Mr Rupert Murdoch's “The

the bottom of their page 3 on Tuesday
of last week that a new managing editor
had been appointed. The report stated
succinctly: “Mr Walter Kommer has
been appointed managing-editor of ‘The
Australian’. Mr Kommer, who has been
assistant managing - editor since the
paper's inception, succeeds Mr Maxwell
Newton, who has resigned.”
Mr Newton had been managing-editor
since the launching of “The Australian”

wanted to be associated with a “quality,.

however, the paper has not been success-

raise its circulation to 100,000 by
Christmas, has been increasingly busy in
the editorial departments, acting as man-
aging-editor, editor, sub-editor and
evaluator of stories. His policy is to
popularise the newspaper and to force
into it the type of story which Mr

he was not paying) which may pos-
sibly succeed but which must destroy
the original idea behind the paper. He
claimed that the appeal of the paper
so far has been to professional people,
businessmen and academics. On this
basis the newspaper could, he believed,
expand, whereas on the Murdoch policy
it might lose this basis and fail to cap-
ture new readers. Further, he argued,
the advertisers, who are now paying a
stiff rate on the understanding that their
advertisements will reach solid readers,
may, under the new policy, withdraw.
Mr Murdoch’s views prevailed and
Mr Newton resigned. This is not sur-
prising. Mr Murdoch is the managing-
director and in a sense the proprietor,
as he has the largest shareholding in the
company, and conservatively it is
estimated that he has indulged Mr New-
ton in his ideas to the extent of £1- mil-
lion so far—plus establishment expenses.
Mr Newton is currently assisting Mr
Roger Ray of Canberra in a small, in-
dependent news service, and describes
himself as “unemployed”.
SOUTH AUSTRALIA
The Stone
Mason
Treasurer or Premier?
ADELAIDE The LCL’s record
term in office in South Australia ended
last week when the ALP prised Sir
Thomas Playford and his party out of
the Government benches in the House of
Assembly after 32 years. But the new
Labor Government faces a hostile Upper
House where, under the limited franchise
system, the LCL holds 16 of the 20 seats.
The first Labor Government in SA
since 1933 reaffirmed immediately after
its election that one of its first actions
would be to implement moves to wipe
out Playford’s gerrymander. It proposes
to increase the number of seats in the
Assembly and introduce universal fran-
chise for both Houses, by amending the
State’s Constitutional Act. But this
requires an absolute majority in both
Houses, and the LCL can tie up the new
Government’s electoral reforms in the
Legislative Council almost indefinitely.
The new leader in Parliament House,
Mr Frank Walsh, once worked on the
construction of the building as a stone
mason. He entered politics through the
Stone Masons’ Society, of which he was
State and Federal secretary. Since 1962,
when the LCL scrambled back into
power only with the support of the two
Independent members, Walsh had ad-
dressed Playford as “Treasurer”, refusing
to acknowledge him as rightful Premier.
Under the State ALP’s retiring age rule,
this will be Walsh’s last Parliament.


The New Wave of Irish Emigrants
Looking forward instead of back
By PATRICIA ROLFE
The Irish National Association head-
quarters in Sydney is a handsome
10-year-old mortgaged building
near Central Railway. On the ground
floor each Sunday and Wednesday a
dance is held. Two or three hundred
young people, mostly Irish but with some
Australians, crow'd the hall, the girls
sitting on chairs against the walls, the
men crowding the doorway—an atmo-
sphere in which both Irish and Aus-
tralians feel at home. It’s not exactly the
Silver Spade room but many young
people meet here, marry and soon after
disappear almost without trace into the
Australian community.
On the second floor is one of the most
handsome libraries on Irish history and
literature outside Ireland. It is made up
largely of books which belonged to the
immigrants of the last century, who often
had little to bring except their pride and
their past. There is a replica of the Book
of Kells, Martin Haverty’s noted History
of Ireland, massive volumes of the lives of
the Irish saints, books on Irish genealogy.
Sometimes the young Irish visit the
library but generally it’s only to read the
Irish newspapers. The library is used
mostly by university students.
It seems extraordinary that such a
small national minority should have such
a large building to serve its needs in
Sydney. It is hard to work out how many
Irish-born people there are in this
country. The Ambassador, Dr Eoin Mac-
White, estimates that about 51,000 have
come here since 1920 and between 30,000
and 35,000 of these remain Irish nation-
als. The Immigration Department, with
no offence intended, one is sure, lumps
the Irish in with the British, whether they
come here via Britain or not. At the last
census, in 1961, there were 7629 Irish,
plus 29,417 undefined Irish that is
people who hadn’t specified whether they
came from the Republic or the Six
Counties living here.
However, perhaps a quarter of the
Australian population about as many
people as live in Ireland today is of
Irish descent. So the handsome building
does not only cater for a national min-
ority. It serves as a shrine of the Irish-
Australian brand of Irishman.
As migration from Ireland has been
so small in the past 50 years most Irish-
Australians are now at least two genera-
tions removed. Their lack of interest in
Ireland may be total. But there is a min-
ority, many of whom have never been to
Ireland and don't seem to want much to
go there, who live here in a Celtic
twilight, believing that “the Irish never
change”, and who seem shocked and dis-
appointed at the young Irish migrants,
living proof that the Troubles are over.
Between the forward-looking young
Irish and the backward-looking Irish-
Austral ians there is a gulf w'hich some-
times seems as wide as any that ever
divided Ireland.
The new Irish in Australia have fairly
simple attitudes to Ireland and to Austra-
lia. The general view on their homeland
is that Ireland's economy is so tightly
bound up wdth Britain’s that no breach
between the countries can be sustained.
Their hope is that Britain will eventually
go into the Common Market and take
Ireland with her. Once that happens, say
the young Irish, the partition of north
and south will simply fade away.
According to some of the young Irish
here, Australia makes little impact on Ire-
land these days. “All that is known of
Australia in Ireland now is that your
Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,
squabbled for years about the appoint-
ment of an ambassador and what title
the Irish ambassador should have,” one
said. “Now I suppose all they know
is that he’s appointed a Scot as
Australian ambassador.
“If an Irishman wants to leave home
he will first think of America or Canada.
There he knows he is sure of a welcome.
But Australia means nothing, or else he
thinks it is a place where bigotry and
prejudice linger on.”
The young Irishman’s commonsense
attitude towards relations with Britain
and the rest of the world does not mean
that he does not value his country's
identity. The young Irish here feel that
Ireland gets a poor Press coverage. It is
not much consolation that because of
cheap Commonwealth cable rates most
stories emanate from London and few
European countries get anything like a
reasonable representation in the daily
Press.
“The only thing that ever seems to
get into the papers here is the IRA,” one
said. “Don’t they know the IRA is only
a joke in Ireland? There was more in the
papers here about the Princess Margaret
incident than there was in the Irish Press.
That sort of thing is just the work of a
few larrikins. And, besides, the IRA is an

illegal organisation. Brendan Behan spent
eight years in Irish prisons and two in
Borstal. He wasn’t imprisoned by the
wicked English. He was imprisoned by
the Irish.”
The sort of Irishman they would like
Australians to know about is Sean Mac-
Bride, a former External Affairs Minister
and a son of Maud Gonne. Mr Macßride
is now chairman of the United Nations
Human Rights Commission. The first case
to come before him was an IRA man,
who accused the Irish Government of
false imprisonment. If the young Irish
have a hero it is Conor Cruise O’Brien,
who went to Katanga as special assistant
to the then Secretary-General of UN,
Dag Hammarskjoeld, and who is now
Vice-Chancellor of Ghana University.
Few of the newcomers seem to have
much prejudice against, or even any
particular attitude towards, Britain. Many
of them come here via Britain, so perhaps
those who are inclined to carry on old
squabbles remain in Ireland. The Irish
are not eligible for a £lO passage to
Australia. Together with Americans, the
French, Swiss and Scandinavians they can
get assisted passages of £7l/8/6 for each
adult.
Drifting here
Tt takes only six months’ residence in
Britain for an Irishman to qualify for
a £lO passage. However, few Irish have
a long-term plan of getting to Australia
cheaply this way. Generally it is not until
they have lived in England for a time
that they become aware of Australia’s
existence through immigration propa-
ganda. The Irish Government does not
allow Australia to advertise for migrants
in Ireland.
Many of those who come to Australia
seem to drift here almost by accident.
Few come to stay with relations, and it
seems that few ever bother to look up
their Australian relatives. There are a
few university people. One of these is
Professor J. D. Smyth, professor of zoo-
logy at the Australian National Univer-
sity, who is a world authority on hydatids.
Some doctors come and can practise in
any State except Queensland. But the
most numerous single group may still be
Roman Catholic priests, nuns and
brothers.
Priests still come regularly, although
more often to Melbourne than to Sydney
and more often to country dioceses than
\o city ones. Some orders of nuns regu-
larly recruit in Ireland, although the
organised recruiting when representatives
of Australian orders used to persuade
Irish girls as young as 14 and 15 to come
to Australian convents has stopped.
Otherwise there are groups of young
men to be found in the Snowy, where
there have been enough at times for
Gaelic football teams, and in other
major projects. Most of these come
with the idea of earning as much money
as they can to go back home and buy
a farm or business. Many of them suc-
ceed. Others have the Irish ability to
let money slip through their fingers so
they stay on. Others marry and give
up all idea of going back home.
Single girls do not come in any great
numbers. There seem to be no succes-
sors to the Irish servant girls who came
in hundreds at the end of the last cen-
tury. These often came alone, sent
money home regularly, contributed to
their Church and yet managed to bring
out a brother or sister, and, in time,
went on to become those formidable
little Irish mothers who ruled families
and ran pubs all over Australia.
Among those who have come from
Ireland in this century is Mr Dan
Minogue, the Federal member for West
Sydney, a notably good local member
and a Labor politician of the old school.
The biggest success story of the Irish-
born here is Mr Tom Ahem, of Perth,

Who discovered SINGAPORE?
We did! The travel agent started it by explaining it wouldn't cost a penny
more to stop-over in Singapore, on our way to Europe. On those terms who
would miss the chance to go on a voyage of discovery!
So we came to Singapore. The friendly, cosmopolitan people welcomed us
to their fascinating country and we were set fair to uncover an array of
spectacle and excitement that gave real meaning to the saying—‘You see
more of the Orient in Singapore.’ Take a glimpse at this magical island
with us and you too will be taking the first steps towards discovering wonder-
ful Singapore.
SHOPPING like Aladdin’s Oaves! You name it —
they’ve got it here, and at prices that make you feel like a king! Singapore
is a duty-free port and that means you can buy the whole world's luxuries
at prices that put the fun back into shopping. Cameras, transistor radios,
rare fabrics, jewellery, and works of art from all over the Orient. All this
and you buy in the friendliest surroundings imaginable. When you get off
the beaten track there’s a lot of laughs to be had by bargaining for what
you purchase.
What could we do when we were offered a 2 band, 8 transistor portable for
A£6! We bought it! And lots of similar bargains: now we can't stop con-
gratulating ourselves.

who came from Cork in 1911 and who
is now certainly, a millionaire. Mr
Ahern, who is 80, went to the gold-rush
town of Kalgoorlie as a draper. He later
returned to Perth and after several years
as employee in local shops in 1922
formed his own company.
One Irishman with a picturesque past
is Mr William McGuinness, of Bathurst,
NSW. He was one of the early members
of the Irish National Association, found-
ed in 1915 by a group of people, the
driving force among whom was Albert
Dryer, a third-generation Australian.
In 1918 Mr McGuinness was one of
seven members of the association who
were arrested by civil and military
police and interned in Darlinghurst gaol
until the Armistice in November. Today
he is the only survivor of the seven.
Mr McGuinness is still secretary of
the Bathurst branch of the Australian
Labor Party, but plans to “get out
quietly” after the State elections in May,
at which, he confidently believes, the
local member, the Chief Secretary, Mr
Gus Kelly, will be returned again.
Mr McGuinness came to Australia in
1912 from Ulster. He came unwilling-
ly but his widowed mother persuaded
him they should join his brother here.
But young William had already em-
barked on a career with the Ulster
Literary Theatre, where he had appeared
in a production of Yeats’s “Kathleen ni
Houlihan”. He had also had an offer
to go to Dublin to work for a Sinn Fein
newspaper, had met a young Donn
Byrne and had spent a day boating on
a lake in the Glens of Antrim with Sir
Roger Casement, who appeared to him
the “finest gentleman who ever walked”.
A dangerous lot
Hpo leave this for Sydney was a sad
A blow. However, within a few years
Mr McGuinness was active in the
Irish National Association and had
settled down to life here, until the calm
pattern was broken by his arrest.
“We were arrested in mid-1918,” he
said. “Although the rising was in 1916
it wasn't until 1918 that they decided we
were a dangerous lot. I’m not sure that
what we did was dangerous but it was
pretty silly. Albert Dryer was at the
back of it, but you’ve got to understand
he was a third-generation Australian so
he thought differently from us. He
thought this was getting something done
at last, this was striking a blow for
Ireland. What happened was that one
night a man named Doran came from
Melbourne to the association gathering
and began quietly trying to recruit
people for the Irish Republican Brigade.
Now it was a silly thing to do and when
I realised what was happening I went
across and told Albert so.


How long,
can you go on
absorbing
increased costs?
Today, the Australian Metals Index stands
at 473 —a rise of 7.75% in 12 months —and
the daily papers bristle with news of
“higher wages,” “increased taxes,” “shorter
hours” and other items of rising costs.
The ability of management to protect its
earning power —and competitive position —-
is directly proportional to its adaptability to
offset higher costs through more productive
methods.
The methods of 20 years ago would not pay
your interest today; and today’s methods
may not provide you with a profit tomorrow.
The important thing is to learn now what
is new, to try out and put to test the promis-
ing things, and to adopt as quickly as
possible those advances that prove they can
lower costs or improve the product and its
marketability.
If welding is important in your operations,
that’s where Lincoln Electric comes in.
As Australia’s largest manufacturer of arc
welding machines and electrodes we know
what is happening technically here and
overseas.
And as a welding specialist, the man from
Lincoln is trained to recognise potential
welding improvements.
Are you getting this sort of help from your
welding supplier—or only welding supplies
as ordered?
When profit improvement has to come from
holding down your costs you should have
this sort of help—you are already paying
for it, why not have it?

“But one night I came home to our
cottage in Forest Lodge to find four
men waiting to take me to Darlinghurst
gaol. My mother looked very worried.
I stud ‘l’ll be home for tea’, but I didn’t
get home for five months. However,
we were very well treated in Darling-
hurst. We were political prisoners, of
course. After we were released we were
heroes. We went down to Melbourne
for celebrations. It was then that I met
Arthur Calwell for the first time. He
hadn’t gone into politics then. He was
working for the Treasury. He’s a nice
man, Arthur, but I don’t like what’s
happened do him.”
Taw many Hall still
QJome of the new Irish profess to be
dumbfounded by aspects of Irish-
Australian life. “Political life particu-
larly,” one said. “The Irish-Australians
seem to be 50 years out of date in their
thinking and in their politicking. It
takes you back to the days of Tammany
Hall and Honey Fitz. All that is com-
pletely dead in America now and it’s
amazing to see it hanging on here. But,
of course, it will die with this genera-
tion.”
The new Irish are also mildly sur-
prised at the popularity of Irish dancing
here. Irish step dancing has in the past
10 years undergone not only a strong
revival but a purification in this'country.
Previously it was mostly taught by
Scottish teachers and between the jigs
and the reels authenticity was lost. Irish
step dancing is much slower than Scot-
tish with most of the movement con-
centrated in the feet. It is said to give
girls a graceful carriage. Its infiltration
into the Catholic schools in recent years
has meant that among the exponents are
Italian, Polish, Estonian, even Chinese,
girls, as well as the Irish.
Australia is not only not getting many
Irish migrants. She is losing them
almost as fast as they come. Ten years
ago about 1000 came each year and
about 300 went back. But in the year
1962-63 600 Irish came to Australia
and 450 returned home. Most of them
go because they prefer life there. They
find Australia and Australians lacking in
high spirits and they miss the regular
dances and the endless talk of Irish life.
Counterbalancing the narrowness of
Irish life, which the new Irish say is
vanishing, is a gaiety which Australians
don’t have and which the Irish can’t live
without.
Without a drastic change in present
condition^—fewer Irish coming here,
more of the Irish-born returning home,
and more C't the old, sentimental Irish-
Australians dying out—within genera-
tions Irish influence in Australia may be
a matter only for history.

The Mellowing of Charlton
“The expatriate is a lonely figure ”
From R. J. SCHOLFIELD in London
Switch television on to BBC-1 in
London on a Monday night, and
sooner or later, out of Britain’s
top-ranking quality programme “Panor-
ama”, will come an expressive face and
fruity voice once familiar to thousands
of Australian radio and television own-
ers. They belong to Michael Charlton,
remembered by some of his country-
men as a cricket commentator, by others
as the name in the catch-phrase “and
here is the news, read by Michael
Charlton”, and by even more as the
man who, with Robert Raymond,
founded the ABC programme “Four
Corners” and left it to go abroad just
when many viewers were rejoicing that
a gap had been filled
in Australian tele-
vision.
Whether Charl-
ton's share of the
50 - minute “Pano-
rama” programme
one of the few
serious British pre-
sentations to be
granted a time-spot
so choice as 8.25 to
9.15 p.m. —comes
at the beginning,
middle or end, the
chances are that
when the pro-
gramme is over his
contribution will
turn out to have
been the biggest of
the four or five that
comprise it. For
the fact is, as a top BBC man told re-
porters on a recent visit to Australia,
that Charlton has one of the best tele-
vision jobs in Britain today, and per-
haps in the world.
Charlton, whose departure from Aus-
tralia was shrouded in rumors of institu-
tional meanness and personal ambitions,
would shrink from admitting this. In
a life so hectic that there is little time
to be aware of anything but objectives,
Charlton is more conscious of how
much he has learned since he came to
British television and of the further
learning that awaits him.
All Charlton will concede is that he
has been lucky. Although he says the
allocation of jobs among the half dozen
reporters on “Panorama” is a lottery,
one cannot help feeling this is a trifle
over-simplified. He was no doubt for-
tunate to have been in Ankara just at
the moment when an attempt was made
on the life of Inonu, the Turkish Prime
Minister,- but one doubts whether the
same explanation will do for the string
of jobs, especially in the United States,
that have come his way in the last 18
months, including race riots, the Ken-
nedy assassination and funeral, the Pre-
sidential election and the funeral of
Malcolm X, all commanding audiences
of 16 and 17 millions.
Although Charlton looks gratefully
back on these golden milestones, he
does not think of his career in terms of
pinnacles. Rather, one job flows into
the next with little time in which to
compare or isolate them.
Charlton, who attended two State
schools in Sydney followed by State
school and then
Scotch College in
Perth and two years
of law at the Uni-
versity of Western
Australia, used to be
just another two-
dimensional an-
nouncer, but back in
his earlier Austra-
lian days he sur-
prised many people,
in the transition to
higher things, by
showing that he
had a brain as weil
as a voice. The rich,
rounded vowels that
had faithfully served
the newsroom and
the cricket pitch
acquired new elo-
quence and mean-
ing as an extension of his own min'd.
Charlton is conscious now of having
tightened up in his work. BBC train-
ing has taught him to be less impulsive
in his reactions, less hasty in his refer-
ences, to reach deeper into a subject
before starting to document it, to tell
the story more crisply and effectively.
“I have learned not to point the camera
at the first view that takes my eye when
I step off the plane in a new country,
but to be patient and selective and thus
give sharper emphasis to the subject,”
he said.
He is still agog at the excellence of
BBC briefing services. As he heads for
a rush job, he snatches a file of infor-
mation on the way out the door, and
so good is the range of cuttifgs and
background material in it tbn> he can
become something of an authority on
the subject during the - plane flight.
Charlton gets little time for formal
reading, but the amount he does in

Need one smaller?
Th/s Is the largest Timken tapered roller bearing
we've made. Its outside diameter measures 96.8454
Inches. Soon it will be stationed in more business-
like surroundings, hard at work for a missile maker
as part of a new forming process called internal
roll extrusion.
The bearing wejghs 7,764 pounds. It will be
subjected to thrust loads of 1.5 million pounds
and radial loads of 100,000 pounds. This huge
bearing shows that the basic principles of tapered
roller bearing design are not limited by size. It per-
forms with the same true rolling motion as the
millions of smaller Timken bearings made each year.
But you're not a missile maker? Your product
calls for slightly smaller bearings. We maka
tapered roller bearings all the way down to .3125*
bore. No other bearing design covers such a wide
range of applications so well.
A selection of 10,594 sizes and 30 different types of
Timken bearings is available. An experienced
Timken bearing sales engineer will carefully select
the right Timken beaming to give you the fullest
value for your bearing £.

priming himself for reports and inter-
views is enormous, and is another rea-
son for the confidence that enables him
to go off in any direction for material
to bring back to “Panorama”.
On small assignments for this
news - and - current - affairs magazine
programme, Charlton may take just a
photographer with him, but for larger
jobs the team usually includes a camera
director to interpret Charlton’s broad
requirements to the man who presses
the button. Responsibility on an assign-
ment is not neatly divided, however, and
the team works as a team. Charlton
likes this.
He is quick to repudiate any sug-
gestion of parsimony or feuding at the
ABC when he left it. “The Commission
did what it could. Australia is a small
country with limited resources for tele-
vision and is so remote that even to
leave it involves costly jet fares. “I
realised that Tour Corners’ was some-
what unbalanced, but accepted the diffi-
culties, and my departure had nothing to
do with dissatisfaction but was in response
to the ‘Panorama’ offer. I honestly
cannot account for this offer even today,
except that at the time a batch of re-
porters left the BBC and I assume it was
, desperate. I saw a chance to join the
‘big league’ for a year or two, and took
it.”
It has not all been easy for him. Soon
after joining the BBC he got into
trouble with audience and critics by
mistiming a report on council house
rates so that it ended abruptly and gave
only one side of the story. Occasionally
he has made an audience uneasy by
being a little too aggressive in interviews,
putting his subject off-balance with a
sticky question and jabbing others in
while he is still reeling. But these days
he seldom lets himself pummel an inter-
viewee without sweetening the blows
with a smile, and Charlton smiles well.
What mellowing he has undergone
appears to have happened spontane-
ously, however, for he professes sur-
prise that he should be thought to have
pursued a subject with anything more
than mild tenacity and feels that, if any-
thing, he does not go in for the kill
strongly enough.
Unlike many Australians who are
prisoners of success in London, Charlton
has no intention of staying here. “The
expatriate,” he says, “is a lonely figure.”
Loyalty and affection for Australia, and,
of course, the advantages for children,
are the reasons he gives for his inten-
tion to return, but there is no doubt that
when the time comes it will be a crusa-
der as well as a patriot that reappears.
His view of Australia is not quite so
serene as it was. “I think what I most
like about it is that it cuts one down
to size. I had no reservations about this
until one day in London I mentioned
it to an English friend, and he wryly
replied: ‘Down to what size?’ ”
Charlton does not necessarily want to
return to “Four Corners”, but at least
to something similar. Other Australians
who have watched his progress here
wonder whether he will be able to
revert to the lighter financial diet of the
ABC.
Charlton is hard to get on the phone
and harder still to pin down in his office
at the BBC’s Lime Grove studios in
Shepherd’s Bush, to which he drives,
when in town, from suburban Richmond
in a car that competes with thousands
of others encrusting the kerbsides of the
neighborhood. The demands of the job
also make it hard to find time for him-
self, and he can no longer play golf
as he did in Sydney. The last time he
was on the links was with Lee Kuan
Yew, Prime Minister of Singapore,
when Charlton was there last year doing
a report on Malaysia.

Just the Life
For a Fellow
“Travel is hell ”
By FRED STAW
is a bloody marvellous
place,” artist John Perceval
said, whipping the tops off the
bottles of beer he had told me to bring
to moisten up the interview. “European
artists should come here—they might get
some life into their stuff.”
What pleased him so much was a real
stinker of a hot Melbourne day. Blast-
furnace winds, clouds that leaked all
over the sky like scalded goat’s milk.
Port Phillip Bay hitting the super-heated
beach made louder steam noises than an
espresso machine.
But Perceval is fresh from the deep-
freeze of a European winter. He pointed
his bare stomach at the sea and said that
that, boy, was a sight that left the
Riviera for dead. “I mean it,” he said.
“When you’ve had to rug up like the
Abominable Snowman to do a painting
outside you get a big kick shedding your
gear like this.”
On the wall of his borrowed beach
house two paintings emphasised that con-
trast of climates: one was a blizzard of
oils that he did of a London snow scene,
the other a scorching blister he painted
to capture his Melbourne seaside sum-
mer.
Perceval is spending a few days at the
beach before he goes to Canberra—and
the beginning of winter —on the Austra-
lian National University Fellowship that
brought him back a couple of weeks ago
from his two-year stay in England.
“I’m pretty vague about this fellow-
ship,” he said. “All I really know is
that Sidney Nolan and I are the first to
get it. Mine is worth £2500 for two
years. The terms of the fellowship say
I can go anywhere 1 like, so long as it’s
Canberra, but that’s OK. I’ve only been
away once, and that was enough. Travel
is hell.”
He says he thinks Canberra will be
good for him, too, because he'll be able
to “get inside” himself better than he
would in a bigger place. “I’m not say-
ing that to butter up the ANU,” he said.
“Canberra could really be very suitable”
—and he gave a wry grin—“for a basi-
cally melancholy bloke like me.”
What are his plans for the next two
years—and the years after that? Nothing
special. Just painting, and maybe a bit
of pottery if he can decide what to do
with the two tons of potters’ equipment
he’s shipping out from England.
Even though he had little to say about
his future, he talked" a stream about his
past and the circumstances that led
him to become a founder of the icono-
clastic school of Melbourne painters of
the late 19405.
“I was born 43 years ago on a wheat
farm at Kalgoorlie in Western Austra-
lia,” he said. the time I was four
me and my family knew I was going to
be an artist. That was pretty remarkable,
because nobody in the family had been
an artist up till then. I’ve got a sister
in America who married an artist, which
is the only thing I can say about her
artistic bent, but she divorced him later.
So that leaves me.
“I drew the usual things that kids do
—horses, trains, that sort of thing. I
didn’t really take to it seriously till I
came to Melbourne when I was about
12 with a box of water colors and an
ambition to paint like Streeton and Tom
Roberts.
“I got polio when I was 13 and spent
18 months in bed doing a lot of paint-
ing, mostly reproductions of Van Gogh.


LEARN FRENCH* AS NATURALLY AS HE DID
BY LISTENING
He learnt French as a child by listening to other people. You can do exactly the same
through Linguaphone. The only difference is that you listen to the voices of distinguished
speakers and professors on Linguaphone recordings (45 r.p.m. or tape). What they say
is specially designed to help you learn the language in a short time —an incredibly short
time.
Learning by Linguaphone is wonderfully easy. The process of learning almost takes you
by surprise You find yourself speaking the language, sapturing the right accent and
intonation without any particular effort. To make sure you learn the written language at
the same time, you follow each lesson in an illustrated textbook. Linguaphone is the finest
audio-visual way of learning a language.
Over a million people have learned a language in this way choosing from thirty-

I was very glad to get polio because it
got me out of Trinity Grammar at Kew.
“They had an art teacher there. My
mother told him I wanted to be an artist
and he said, ‘What a pity, Mrs Perceval,’
because he didn’t think I could paint at
all —in those days people like him were
painting orange flower pots with apples
beside them. I was already ahead of
him as an artist and I knew it. He
didn’t, which was probably better for
him.
“About that time Arnold Shaw gave
me my first box of oils —he had seen
some of my water colors and decided I
was all right. I think I really started to
become an artist from that day. I used
to read a lot of books about the great
artists and I knew all about them. But
I’m not interested now. I’m only inter-
ested in what I’m doing myself.”
Still, Perceval had no formal training
at all until he was already an established
artist. He had won prizes and was ex-
hibited in Melbourne and Sydney galler-
ies when he became a student at the
National Gallery in Melbourne in 1948.
“They couldn’t teach me anything,” he
said. “They didn’t know anything, any-
way, and as they didn’t like what I tried
to teach them they tossed me out after
six months. I didn’t care because I only
went there to get the six quid a week I
qualified for as a National Training
student when I got out of the Army.”
Touring his war years in the Army —as
a batman, because his polio-withered
leg stopped him joining the AIF, he met
Melbourne artist Arthur Boyd and
married Boyd’s sister. Mary. The three
of them lived together in the Melbourne
suburb of Murrumbeena after the war.
Perceval and Boyd, the son of Australia’s
first studio potter, Merric Boyd, started
a pottery works.
“We potted in the daytime and we
painted at night, and we met Nolan and
Tucker and several others, and we grew
up together as artists. That was the
beginning of the big Melbourne move-
ment, as it became known, that changed
the style of what we called acadenTic
art into what we called modern art. We
used to call people like Dargie academics
and labelled ourselves as moderns —and,
of course, nobody would recognise us.
“Dargie was a bore, and he domina-
ted the National Gallery school of paint-
ers. Were we iconoclasts? I suppose so
—we were certainly knocking the estab-
lishment of Australian art.”
Perceval made just as big a splash as
a potter as he did with his paintings. He
rediscovered the difficult sang-de-boeuf
color technique that ancient Chinese
potters used to achieve an ox-blood
red. And he spent a couple of years
making his ceramic angels.
Perceval doesn’t think much of Euro-
pean artists. “There’s nothing in. con-
temporary European painting that ex-
cites me at all,” he said. “The Austra-
lians are the only ones for me. I’ve
been to hundreds of exhibitions in Lon-
don trying to find some vitality, and
there’s none—it’s not until you’ve found
that out that you realise how good the
Australians are.”
He calls this Australian ascendancy
“an accident of history”, and offers no
explanation for it, beyond adding that
the rest of the world doesn’t know about
it yet.
And at this stage of the interview,
with all the beer gone, two schoolboys
poked their heads in the door and asked
what he had painted lately. “Go over
to the house next door,” he told them
cheerily, “you’ll see lots of stuff over
there.”
Then when they’d hot-footed it away
he winked and said, “They’ve really been
wandering around trying to meet those
two gorgeous teenage daughters of mine
—I thought I’d give them a chance.”

The Vision of the Rope
By DICHTER
Coming out of Spain last summer, I
stopped in a high Pyreneean pass
to take the view and the air. No
sooner had I pulled into the vantage
point off the narrow road than two cars
coming up from the French side
screeched to a dusty stop there too.
From the second there shot out a little
man florid with rage, who ran over to
the first vehicle and pulled out by the
scruff of the neck its driver, who was
already getting out to defend himself. As
they fell to the ground locked in clumsy,
clawing embraces, women and children
emerged crying from both cars. One
wife sought to separate the combatants,
but the other, armed with her shoe,
vigorously took her husband’s side. The
brawl ended when the attacker, who had
a bigger car but a smaller body, was
bloodied, exhausted and tattered.
Watching these modern paladins cf the
automobile writhing at my feet in a
new battle of Roncevaux, I remembered
Kalu, the Lepcha truck-driver who had
saved my skin years before in the Hima-
layas on the road down from Tibet.
For it was quite clear what had hap-
pened. A car that was a good climber
had been stuck for ten gruelling miles
behind a slower vehicle on a narrow,
winding mountain road. The driver in
front had begun by simply obeying the
rules, which forbid overtaking, but irri-
tated by the constant tooting he had no
doubt turned nasty and had prevented
the car behind overtaking in places where
it would have been safe.
Kalu had had a similar experience
while manoeuvring his heavy truck on the
mountain roads of Sikkim, the buffer
state between India and Tibet. I never
knew whether he was in front or behind,
but I know that when at last both
vehicles could stop, Kalu did a strange
thing before dismounting. He will spend
the rest of his life wondering why he
did it. He reached into his tool box
and took out a large spanner.
Charged with murder, he pleaded and
was found guilty in the court of the
foothills town. Oriental justice has
humane moments. Before pronouncing
sentence, the judge said to him: “I must
convict you either to be hanged or to go
to prison for life. Either way, you .will
not be seeing your family for a long
while. Since they live far from here in
the mountains near Tibet, I release you
on parole for 15 days: the time to go
back to your village and make provision
for your wife and children and parents.
If you are back here on June 10, you
will probably get life. If you are not
back here by June 10, you will be treated
as an absconder and will certainly get
a death sentence.”
I met Kalu ten days later, when I was
coming down on foot from Natu-La, the
pass that takes the mule-track from
Gangtok to Gyantse, and on to Lhasa.
We had to walk to where the road be-
gan (in those days; the Indians have since
built a jeepable road all the way up),
and there we could catch a bus that
would get us down to the foothills in
plenty of time for Kalu to get his life
sentence. One of the hills on which Dar-
jeeling is built had collapsed in the night,
killing 80 people in their beds and leaving
thousands roofless in the rains; an
epidemic was soon to follow. Sikkim,
Kalimpong, Darjeeling, the whole region
was devastated and cut off from the out-
side world.
One could sit and wait for rescue
parties to get through; there were safe
villages and the first isolated tea gardens
were in sight, where hospitality would
be available. Some of our party, which
had swollen to several scores as we
passed through marooned settlements,
decided to do so. But by that time, I
was anxious to get back to civilisation
with the first news of the Darjeeling
catastrophe, all the more because I had
been unable to get the story I had wanted
on the Chinese invasion of Tibet; the
road to Gyantse was already cut and the
country more closed than ever. This
merely professional urge would not have
got me through the ruined Teesta valley,
were it not that Kalu was moved by
something infinitely stronger, the vision
of the hangman’s rope.
Through four days ana nights, in
which pouring rain never ceased for a
moment, this murderer carrieo a handful
of us —who had in him a
leader of men to whom one could entrust
one’s life across raging torrents and
over trembling hillsides where every
false step sent a ton of earth crashing
down into the furious Teesta.
As our strange captain brought us
down into the foothills (we covered 80
miles in four days, thanks in part to
lifts at the end), the going became easier
but the heat more sweltering and the
drinking water less trustworthy. We
reached “civilisation” which meant a
telegraph office for me, and a gaol for
him sick from exposure, constant wet-
ness, bad water and dubious food. I
took his photo, but it neve: came out,
for my camera was wrecked. We shook
hands and parted, I to the airport, Kalu
to life imprisonment for murder. This
is a purely personal reason, and possibly
a poor one, for my opposition to capital
punishment.

INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL
The Pain and
the Glory
By HUGH CURNOW
emphasised Sidney Nolan,
* was the key to it all. Violence and
religion, in a way. Take those poor
Negroes in Alabama. “They’re praying.
Down on their knees praying. While
we, the civilised ones, are armed with
guns and truncheons to shoot them or
beat them down further,” he told me.
“It’s just like the old days, really: The
Christians in the amphitheatre kneeling
before the swords and lions. All
bloodied and mauled and praying.
That’s how they destroyed the tyrants —
on their knees.”
Mr Nolan’s dressing-gowned wife,
Cynthia, looked up from a newspaper
feature on America and said she would
prefer Sid to answer the question that
followed on that: Are the Nolans reli-
gious people?
“It concerns you as well as me,” he
told her. “You first,” she smiled from
behind sun glasses she had donned to
soothe her “bushfire eyes’’. Mr Nolan
glanced out the window of their 11th-
floor room in a Sydney hotel and mused.
“I would say I would like to be a religi-
ous person,” he began. Mrs Nolan
interjected. “I would say you are a very
religious person,” she told him. He
smiled. “Perhaps I am. But I feel we
20th-century ones are midway between
two religions. The first is Christianity
which has been tried and found wanting.
The second is yet to come. God only
knows what it might be ... As of now,
however, I agree with Archbishop
Gough’s reported reluctant admission
that the so-called ‘post-Christian era’ is
a fact. I also believe that the post-
civilisation era is a fact. We are living
in it now.”
Violence, again, was the key to that,
too. “I expect when we go to New
Guinea soon that we will find the same
sort of violence among primitive people
there as now exists throughout the
world. Civilisations, intrinsically con-
nected with religions, seem to have suc-
cumbed to human violence. I would
say now that violence is one of the basic
human instincts.”
Hence the violence in his Ned Kelly
paintings and the Leda series? “Exactly.
It’s also in my Gallipoli paintings but in
a different way. There the morality, if
you can call it that, is that violence and
death and war produce pain as well as
glory. Only through pain comes the
glory, in fact.”
Did he always resolve for himself a
moral attitude to a series of paintings
before beginning work on them? “There
ought to be a better word than ‘moral’,
I think,” said Mrs Nolan. “Perhaps
‘philosophical’ would be more correct.”
Mr Nolan thought about that and said
no, moral was the word. “I don’t actu-
ally know how much is instinct and how
much is formulated but I feel I paint
chiefly by instinct and my moral atti-
tudes show through.”
Changing the subject to the Nolans’
life in London brought Mrs Nolan’s
opinion that if they mixed around more
there they might have a better idea of
what people were saying about her hus-
band. He said he was unaware of any
jealousy among other artists about his
successes and that even if some of the
English painters didn’t call in to visit
him that wasn't something he would
notice much as he preferred a rather
solitary life with his wife.
“We have so much to do each day
what with my painting and Cyn’s writ-
ing. This here” (picking up a proof
copy from the coffee table) “is her latest,
‘One Traveller’s Africa’. Some of my
African paintings illustrate it. They
are excellent reproductions . . “ —And
mostly The Bulletin blocks, I would
like you to mention. It’s so important
that an artist’s paintings are reproduced
faithfully,” said Mrs Nolan. He dis-
agreed. “I doubt if it matters all that
much. You can’t expect 100 per cent
reproductions. It doesn’t bother me if
the color is a bit wrong. I would be
surprised if it' wasn’t, sometimes.”
He added that the color film of his
Gallipoli series he had seen at its Can-
berra premiere was “as good as I could
wish”. Now he was planning a collec-
tion of Antarctica paintings to include the
story of Coleridge’s “Ancient Mariner”.
Mrs Nolan said that by then she hoped
Australians would have stopped adding
up the cost of paintings in a collection
to see how many pounds it was worth.
“This is about the last country left in
the world where quite so much emphasis
is placed on the monetary value of art,”
she said. “Oh, I don't know,” he re-
plied. “It's the sort of thing artists talk
about when they get together.”

“To do business around the world I needed an
airline that flew everywhere. That’s why I tried
Pan Am. That’s why I’ve stuck with Pan Am.”
—says Mr. Harold Porter, Packaging Exporter, of Melbourne
“I do a lot of flying ’round the world
and every time I take a trip on Pan
Am I learn something new. My
most recent trip took me through
the U.S., Britain, Scandinavia, and
the Far East. I learned that Pan
Am flies straight through to Europe,
not just from New York, but from
major U.S. cities like Detroit, Chi-
cago, Seattle and San Francisco
17 cities in all. That kind of con-
venience is invaluable to a business-
man in a hurry.”
Businessmen fly Pan Am every-
where. With good reason. Pan Am
has a wealth of experience with the
needs of businessmen. And it puts
that experience to work. In arrang-
ing reservations, making quick con-
nections, planning itineraries, and in
seeing to it that in-flight service
covers a businessman’s every re-
quirement. That’s why Pan Am has
won a worldwide reputation among
businessmen. Why not find out for
yourself? All you have to do is call
your Pan Am Travel Agent. Or call
us. You’ll have a good feeling know-
ing you’ve chosen the very best.

After all , Sydney hasn’t got a Yarra
What a lovely time we had at
Moomba. The city was gorge-
ously decorated with brilliantly
covered pieces of cloth called clowns’
pants. These hung from the overhead
tramway wires in Flinders St and Col-
lins St. And that’s another sound argu-
ment for retaining trams in Melbourne,
they provide a place to hang clowns’
pants.
The character of the festival has
changed, though. It used to be “Eight-
hour Day”. Grandmother used to adore
it. She always said that the great pro-
cession started up at the Eight-hour Day
monument near the Trades Hall, then
came down Swanston Street. Tremen-
dous, it was. All the unions had drays
with shows depicting their craft pulled by
magnificently plumed Clydesdales. The
marching men had their expensive hand-
painted silk banners. There were
clowns. The confectionery makers
tossed out free sweets, the bakers gave
free cakes and buns, the rope makers
gave free skipping ropes.
The march languished, became
smaller and smaller, the banners rotted
in back rooms at the Trades Hall, so
the capitalists of Bourke Street stepped
in with their Moomba. And grand-
mother would be livid if she knew that
the capitalists started their procession
also darned near the Eight-hour monu-
ment. But never mind, I bet all the
Moomba queens and marching girls in
their comic opera outfits this week,
hadn’t the slightest idea what it stood
for, anyway.
How cultured was it? The number of
items according to the director Don
Ingersole, was up from 89 to 135. But
that’s the thing about Moomba, if any-
one is running a knitting competition
in Coburg it's likely to get into the
official programme. Then all the little
theatre groups and art galleries, who
are famished for publicity during the
rest of the year, go for their lives come
Moomba. They’re down on every pub-
lished list of daily events. If we really
wanted it we could have been at Shakes-
peare, Anouilh or Shelagh Delaney, a
book fair or a night of Australian com-
posers or a symposium on the works of
Nettie Palmer.
But it’s all very well to be fright-
fully Adelaide Festival and all that.
You’ve got to understand that Moomba
originally was a plot hatched by the
department stores and the city council
to get people back into the city. There-
fore Anouilh or Nettie Palmer is not
always the answer.
But, frankly, it was a pretty good
Moomba. We had the Moscow State
Circus. The Carlton and United Brew-
eries brought down a water ski review
and a team of lush belles from Surfers
Paradise. Every lunch hour and every
night they gave their free demonstra-
tions before crowds of 50,000 on the
Yarra. Every night there was a free
show in the Myer Music Bowl, rock-
pop, The Victorian Symphony Orchestra,
military bands and the TV shows. One
night we could go along to the bowl
and see our beloved Graham Kennedy
doing his “In Melbourne Tonight” and
on another Bill Collins creating his
“Sunnyside Up”.
Oh yes, you could even stand at the
corner of Elizabeth and Collins to
listen to the daily performance by the
GPO’s carillon of such numbers as
“Elome, Sweet Home,” “All Through the
Night” and “Rule Britannia”.
But Sydney contributed considerably
to the success of Moomba. Sydney sent
several teams of her struttingest, baton-
swingingest marching girls, her Lord
Mayor Alderman Jensen and the Manly
ferry North Head. The ferry has really
taken the town. Thrice daily during
Moomba it was off with 1000 passen-
gers, and it has been hired for a whole
series of charters. All the expatriate
Sydneysiders got down there at No. 3
north wharf. There was the dear old
shape in the authentic green and white.
Tears ran down their cheeks.
Then there were the old Melburnians
who remembered paddle steamers like
the Weeroona which used to chug
their way to Portsea. They too had a
nostalgic sob.
Sydney's Lord Mayor, too, was ter-
ribly nice. He said that he enjoyed im-
mensely his involvement in Moomba.
“The water ski-ing,” he added, “was
excellent and I think Sydney should in-
clude something similar in its festival.
Of course we do have one difficulty
we don’t have a venue like the Yarra.”
The Labor Day holiday procession
was a very big deal. The fanciest, the
most expensive floats were provided by
the department stores. Waltons were in
it for the first time and their float broke
down just near Myers. They had Miss
Australia up top, and the poor girl had
to sit there for nearly two hours trying
to smile sweetly at the same crowd.
Actually the procession was a bore.
It took far too long to go past. There
were radio announcers complete with
amplifiers all along the route. Their job
was to flagellate the crowd into
enthusiasm, but the mob stood in glum
silence. The only time they cheered and
went wild was when Ron Barassi went
by atop a Volkswagen and wearing his
31 Carlton guernsey.
The procession needs more guts,
enthusiasm and fun. As it is now grand-
mother would be terribly unimpressed.

OVERSEAS
Lee Kuan Yew
Not an easy man to get on with
By ALEX JOSEY
IN the “Washington Post” early in
February, an interviewer said of
Singapore’s Prime Minister Lee
Kuan Yew, who is visiting Australia
this week, that he is “considered by
many to be the most brilliant politician
in South-East Asia today”. This type
of remark is guaranteed to annoy Lee’s
critics much more than it disturbs Lee
who, if asked, would probably describe
it as “meaningless”. Supremely confi-
dent, coldly analytical, Lee has no liking
for sycophancy or exaggeration. The
interview in the “Washington Post” did
more than annoy: it created something
of a storm. The “Malayan Times”
described it as a “scurrilous” article,
along the line of those carried in The
Bulletin.
These attacks, which have been mount-
ing in intensity since April last year, are
a measure of Lee Kuan Yew’s un-
popularity with the Central Govern-
ment, with the Alliance Party, and with
Malay leaders in Kuala Lumpur.
Lee is not an easy man to get on
with: he is energetically disliked by
some and feared by more. Genuinely
clever men, those who are far-seeking
and usually right, are seldom loved,
though they may be respected. Lee may
appear less aggressive, less suspicious at
first meeting, than five or six years ago,
but most of his political opponents
(those not in gaol or exiled abroad) still
consider him arrogant, and eager to
seize an advantage. They accept the
fact that he is brilliant and ruthless, a
skilful debater and a crafty politician
understanding the mechanics of power.
They like him less because of this. They
might admit that he is smoother now.
He has learned how to smile profession-
ally with his lips into a television
camera. But none of this really de-
ceives. Lee Kuan Yew is a tough
fighter, and by nature he cannot be
otherwise. He is a man with a mission,
which was born 23 years ago when the
Japanese conquered Malaysia and made
prisoners of the British and the Austra-
lians. He decided then, as a youth of
19, to fight colonialism and to help
create a State which belonged to all the
people of Malaya, of which he was one.
In Singapore Lee Kuan Yew fought
the Communists and narrowly won a
bitter fight. He struggled for merger
and Malaysia. Eighteen months have
passed since the creation of the new
State, and Malaysian newspapers and
Malaysian leaders talk of “a verbal war”
between Kuala Lumpur and Singapore.
This is more than a clash of personali-
ties. Lee represents socialism in Malay-
sia. Lee, notwithstanding all his talents,
is, in the final analysis, no more than
the power of the People’s Action Party,
which opposes communalism altogether,
whereas some conservative Malay leaders
support communalism in the name of
equality of communities.
In the statement of Objectives and
Policy, the PAP expressed the belief that
“Malay poverty can be abolished only
by democratic socialist economic plan-
ning. The system of free enterprise,
which now prevails throughout all sectors
of the Malaysian economy, cannot bring
about a better life for Malay peasants,
however suitable it may be as a means of
development and progress in trade and
industries in the cities.
“It is the role of the PAP in Malay-
sia,” continued the statement, “to con-
vince the moderate leadership of the
Malays that there is a rational economic
method to abolishing rural poverty.”
The PAP warned that an “irrational
political solution, as has been attempted
in Indonesia through xenophobic
nationalism, expropriation of property”,
and so on, “could lead to the disinte-
gration of Malaysia”.
Whatever the merit of Lee Kuan
Yew’s arguments, the Malay leadership
in the Alliance Government moved fur-
ther away from, not closer to, Singapore’s
Premier. Mr Tan Siew Sin, leader of
the Malayan Chinese Association, the
Tunku’s Finance Minister, joined in the
attack upon him. Mr Tan publicly
accused Lee of running a Fascist-type
Government—“ Hitler’s government was
also efficient”—and declared that Lee
ruled Singapore by fear. Mr Tan said
there was no democracy in Singapore.
Businessmen spoke in whispers, fearful
of Government spies.
In the public exchanges between the
Alliance and the PAP, Mr S. Rajarat-
nam, Minister for Culture, challenged
the Alliance to produce “specific evi-
dence” that the PAP was inflaming com-
munal passions and fears. Inche Musa
bin Hitam, the Political Secretary to the
Central Government’s Minister for
Transport replied. He said that the
Alliance also desires “the inevitable
emergence of a Malaysian unity which
cuts across race and religion”. He
believed that the concept of the Alliance
represented “the most realistic ap-
proach”. The PAP approach (of non-
communalism: Malays, Indians and
Chinese are members of the PAP) is
idealistic and impractical, and ignores
totally the very unique position that our
Malaysian society is now occupying”.
Inche Musa then went on to say:
“The very subtle insinuations of the
PAP leaders by propagating non-com-
munalism and equality of status in
Malaysia at the moment naturally pro-
voke communal sentiments, and so long
as the PAP leaders imply in their
speeches that no race should enjoy pri-
vileges and protection from the other,
so long will a more hardening attitude
result out of the different communities
in Malaysia now.”
Certain Malay privileges, such as free
schooling up to and including university,
are recognised by the Singapore Govern-
ment, but Inche Musa must have had
in mind the socialistic intent of the
People's Action Party, which seeks to
provide “equal opportunities for all”.
Much of the personal abuse of Lee
Kuan Yew, in the Malay language Press
and in the pro-Alliance small circulation
“Malayan Times”, (which recently print-
ed a fictitious interview with the Tunku
in which the Tunku, falsely, was re-
ported to have made a slashing attack
upon Lee), tends to reach, hysteria, but
none of it appears to have much effect
upon Lee himself. He keeps fit by
regular morning bedroom exercises, and
a couple of games of golf during the
week, and carefully watches his diet.
“If only,” a visiting foreign corre-
spondent once remarked to me, “Lee
Kuan Yew also possessed the Tunku’s
charm and gentleness.”
“If only,” said another, “Lee was not
42 and impatient.”
“If only,” murmured a third, “the
problems of multi-racial Malaysia were
not pressing and urgent.”

Staging Another
Revolution
The big men take over from the little people
SEAN LEMASS
From staff correspondent HAROLD DVORETSKY, who
recently visited Ireland
The leprechauns have gone. The ban-
shees, I must report, are finding
life difficult, if not miserable
there is little to wail about. The windows
they might have waited under now look
out on an emerald isle bursting with
economical, social and expansionalist
promise. No work here for a banshee,
little time really for a leprechaun. In Ire-
land today it is very hard to find any-
thing but the memory of the little men
in the green hats. The little men have
been replaced by the big men men
with big ideas and big actions. There is
still a touch of the blarney, though. The
Irish were always great talkers and
great arguers. They still are. Now they
talk and think and plan for a
future, not dwell with a past.
Ireland is going through an economic
and social miracle. Her economy is ex-
panding faster (44 per cent annually be-
tween 1958 and 1963) than most coun-
tries in Europe. In five years more than
200 factories, most built by foreign firms
(mainly British, German and American),
have boosted the economy, helped slash
unemployment figures to a record low
of 5 per cent of the working population
and lifted exports 55 per cent to a
record £2224 million sterling last year.
The work-force itself, once mainly agri-
cultural, is going through a revolution.
Soon, for the first time in Ireland’s his-
tory, more people will be employed in
industry than in agriculture.
Even more pleasing i c that for the
first time-in 100 years the emigration
rate is well below that of the natural in-
crease of around 30,000. Before the
Potato Famine of 1848-50, Ireland had
a population of a little more than
8,000,000. Bled year by year since then
it is now a paltry 2.9 million. Last year
the emigration rate dropped to 15,000.
In 1958 it was almost four times that,
in 1960 more than double.
Now Irishmen overseas are returning
to their homeland not for a visit but
to stay. The Government may soon be
forced (happily) to consider ways and
means of repatriating . her wandering
sons from across the seas to help expand
an ever-growing technological work-force.
This could be necessary. By 1970 Ireland
aims to increase her national income
more than 50 per cent over 1960 and
create 78,000 more new jobs. She plans
to raise her gross national product by at
least 44 per cent each year as she has
done on average over the past five years.
Can she do it? Six years ago there could
have been few who would have rated
her chances of success. Fewer still would
have taken bets on it at any odds. Today
the runner is as much an odds-on favor-
ite to attain her set economic target
by 1970 than the best The Curragh can
produce.
The man behind this great new revo-
lution is one of the leaders of the old.
He is Prime Minister Sean Lemass,
known as the Taoiseach (pronounce it
Tee-such). Lemass, a quietly-spoken, un-
assuming revolutionary, was lucky not to
have been shot out of hand in the botch-
ed 1916 rising. After 30 years as second
in command he took over from that
magnetic and most well-known Irish
revolutionary Eamon de Valera, now
President of the Republic.
“Dev” once taught mathematics
(there was an Irish story claiming he
was one of only 13 men who could com-
prehend the theory of relativity). May-
be, but for all his mathematical prowess
“Dev” never managed to get around to
putting Ireland on a firm economical
basis.
Before Lemass became Minister for
Industry and Commerce in 1957 the
island Republic was about as low econo-
mically as it could be. Thd national
product was at its lowest ebb in modern
times. Between 1948 and 1957 the coun-
try had made an income gain of only
one per cent a year, ten per cent of the
work-force was unemployed and emigra-
tion figures continued to rocket.
By 1958 Lemass, who was soon to
take over the Government, came up with
a five-year economic programme aimed
at increasing the Gross National Product
by around 24 per cent a year. It was a
mild and relatively simple target. “Delib-
erately modest” is now the official
phrase. It had to be. Lemas.- knew, and
admits, failure would not only have been
economically drastic but psychologically
suicidal to the population then down to
2.8 million. Even so the sceptics, and
there were many, regarded even a two
per cent increase as unrealistic.
Lemass’s idea depended on a rapid
build-up of export industries to reduce
the country’s heavy reliance on agricul-
ture then amounting to more than
75 per cent of all exports. To do this
he virtually wiped off the ban on foreign-
owned enterprise, introduced some 30
years earlier, and offered outstanding in-
ducements to overseas industrialists to
establish factories in Ireland. The bait
included grants of up to two-thirds of
capital investment and a ten-year tax
exemption on all profits earned from ex-
ports. Above all, Ireland hao a tremen-
dous work-force available.

making transistor radios, the British
plastics and electronic equipment, the
Israelis razor blades and rolled steel and
the French oil stoves. The French also
planned an aircraft factory to produce
a new short haul plane aimed at inter-
national markets (it goes into production
soon just outside Dublin).
The first programme exceeded even
the most optimistic expectations. Last
year Lemass introduced his second plan
to cover the years between 1964 and
1970. It was first published in August,
1963, and a detailed version published
in July last year. The plan envisaged a
Gross National Product of 50 per cent
over the 1960 level and called for an
increase of 95 per cent in the total vol-
ume of exports and more than 150 per
cent in exports of industrial goods. These
were later adjusted from 95 to 160 per
cent and from 150 to 300 per cent; in
money this was an increase of £lOO
million to a whackirvg £385 million
sterling over the 1960 figure.
Not all rosy
Tf the first plan was mild, this one is
A bold. Even so, and despite the high
aims, given a modicum of luck, it should
work. The path has not all been rosy.
The prize example of economic effort
and expansion is at Shannon airport
the one-time “gateway” to Europe. Un-
fortunately for Shannon the range and
speed of the newer Atlantic planes
doubled and tripled the efforts of the
original DC4s that once set down there
to refuel.
It could have been curtains for Shan-
non as an international airport or for
anything eEe. Then came the 1958 plan
and the idea of a free airport area
trading estate. Firms who operated from
the estate and who used aircraft for
freight or otherwise contributed to the
development of the airport community
were given 25-year tax exemptions on
all export profits. To make it even easier,
the Government helped build factories
or built them itself and rented them out
at low prices. They also built flats and
homes to house more workers. They
played it cool, too. Though they des-
perately wanted new factories the pro-
moters were choosy whom they let in.
They looked mainly for factories who
would eventually employ about 400 and
none that went higher than 1000. Shan-
non has been a great success. There are
now 22 factories employing more than
2500 workers. More factories are now
being built. The total Shannon work-
force, including those working on the
airport, runs to nearly 5000 and the
plan is for the overall work-force to in-
crease by 500 a year. In six years only

Shannon isn’t only a freight terminal.
It has become a key factor in Ireland's
rapidly expanding tourist drive, the
revenue from which went up another
£lO million sterling to £67 million
sterling in 1964. The duty-free shop (it
was the first in Europe and opened
originally in 1947) is one good reason
for tourists to use Shannon as a gateway
into Europe. The shop, laid out like a
big one-floor departmental store, has
everything from cameras to candlesticks,
crocodile handbags to liquor and cigar-
ettes at ridiculously low Hong-Kong type
(duty free) prices. It even provides a
shopping and mail-order guide for those
who might like to send for anything they
may have forgotten. The one-day stop
over at Shannon has become so popular
that this year several American airlines
will make a point of dropping passengers
off for one, two or three day tours and
picking them up again in following air-
craft to take them on to Europe or to
the US.
This type of visitor has helped Aer-
Lingus, the Irish Government-owned,
though autonomous, airline, to become a
major carrier on the cream Atlantic run.
With its three Boeings (it gets another
in April) it has notched up the bfggest
load factor of any airline on the Atlantic
run (65 per cent). Its fleet ox eight Vis-
counts (soon to be almost doubled) have
also created havoc among airlines in
Europe where they again have the high-
est load factor (69.6 per cent last year).
Aer Lingus goes from strength to
strength. It made £1.2 million sterling
profit in 1963, expects to make about
the same this year. Apart from its new
Boeing it will, in July, take delivery of
four BAC 111 short haul jets for use on
its now further-flung European services.
Aer Lingus also operates seven Friend-
ships on internal runs and has three
cargo and car-carrying Corvairs running
between Irish and UK airports.
Last year Aer Lingus helped more
than 374,229 passengers pass through
Shannon. Almost half stayed. More than
20,000 sampled the “live like a lord for
a day and dine like the Irish kings of
old” on a medieval tour. This tour ends
at Bunratty Castle, a fine old pile, with
a mediaeval banquet served by Irish col-
leens dressed as they would have done
500 years ago.
Shannon, with its 10,000 ft. runway,
its small population and long approach
over water, is ideal for roaring jets. It
is cheaper, too, for aircrew training than
London and other big international air-
ports. Most of BOAC’s VCIO captains
and crews are training from there and
the Corporation expects to save itself
more than £300,000 sterling in landing
fees alone. Plus that Shannon is pretty
well fog and foul weather free and fuel
is tax free.
The old adversary
Tronically the one major danger to all
A Lemass’s great plan for Ireland rests
with her former adversary, Britain. The
worst setbacks he has so far had to face
was first when de Gaulle rejected Britain's
entry into the Common Market in 1962
and again when Britain, Ireland’s best
market, slapped on the 15 per cent im-
port surcharge last year.
The whole of Lemass’s plan is geared
to enter the Market alongside Britain.
Already he has started grinding away
tariff barriers and preparing some shel-
tered home industries for the chop. (The
Irish as a nation would be better inform-
ed and prepared for entry into ECM
than any of those not yet in the Com-
munity certainly better than the Brit-
ish have been.) Without the big multi-
million European market open to Irish
manufactured goods, the Irish economic
expansion, as Lemass sees it, could be
strangled.
On the other hand Wilson’s 15 per
cent surcharge taught Lemass a lesson—•
now he has given orders to try and get
some of the export eggs out of the
British basket and into other areas.
Australia is one market the Irish ex-
porters think they might be able to
tap to a better extent than they do now.
While Australia's exports to Ireland
have increased from under £1 million
sterling in 1950 to about £3.5 million
sterling in 1964 (mainly wool and wheat)
the Irish Republic's exports to Australia
have only gone up from a meagre
£67,980 in 1950 to around £220,000
sterling in 1964. The young and en-
thusiastic young Irish who run the ex-
port service they are among the brash
young wave of new thought inside the
Republic plan a survey of Australia
and a few store promotions to strengthen
the feeling towards Irish goods in the
Commonwealth.
But there is another greater reason
why Lemass wants the Common Market

Constant hot water is an essential part of the service a first

second thought. At the hotel’s planning stage, heavily insulated
solid copper hot water tanks were specified. Incidentally, it takes
a bank of four cylinders with a total capacity of 5,400 gallons
to fulfil The Southern Cross Hotel’s needs.

deal to go through. With both Ireland
and Britain in ECM Ireland would be
just that much closer to reunification
with the Protestant North. It could be
the North sees it this way too. Both Le-
rnass and Stormont leader O'Neill have
visited each other. The surprise visits
now “open the way” for further discus-
sions for expansion and joint develop-
ment “a measure of co-operation in
practical matters of public concern” as
the official view has it.
There was little dissension after the
visits (kept secret in case there might
have been) and the facts are coming
clearer. The six Protestant Northern
counties of partition were once much
more prosperous than the South. But the
South is no longer a depressed area, the
North is having its problems and there’s
more of a status quo to start negotiations
which may help bring down the green
curtain and bring the Irish together.
But there is still more to Ireland than
her economics spectacular though
they may be. Despite the great econom-
ic expansion, the many new factories,
thr great rise in car ownership and the
standard of living, the Irish are still the
lovable, friendly folk legend has always
had them. They live in a land of ex-
tremes and contradictions and they can
be extremely contradictory themselves.
As leisurely as of old
Tn business they seem casually efficient.
■*" You ask for something to be done and
feel it never will be but it always is.
They still manage to appear as leisurely
as the Irish of old, yet work as fast
and efficiently as any in the new world.
For a nation with less than three million
souls and with Dublin, its capital, only
the size of Perth, WA, it is remarkable
that it can produce so many top line
young executives and salesmen. Yet its
progress shows it does.
And what of the future? The rise of
the Republic economically at home and
in prestige abroad has been spectacular.
But there is still plenty to be done. New
jobs and a rising population have sud-
denly led to that 20th-century malady, a
housing shortage. Once the Republic had
to cut down on housing schemes too
many people were emigrating and
houses were empty.
The cost of living is some five per
cent higher than it is in neighboring
Britain but the average wage slightly

cu
economic gamble that Ireland will
join the European Common Market
alongside Britain. Would it be worth
going it alone? Lemass says he could,
but he doesn’t favor such a move. Brit-
ain, if only because of her geographical
location, will probably always remain
her best market it would be crazy to
jeopardise it. And there’s always the
traditional question of whether it would
harm the prospects of a united Ireland.
If and when Ireland does join the
Market (she’s still not formally a mem-
ber of GATT although she has applied,
and is taking part in the Kennedy
Round) Lemass has internal problems
with his old established and tariff pro-
tected firms. Some are being given
grants to increase productivity and
match up to European competition. But
some, like Ford’s CKD Assembly at
Cork 60 cars in a one-shift day and
1000 employees vill have to find
other work. Ford’s the Irish company
is still registered as Henry Ford and
Son Ltd. was first set up in 1919 to
produce mainly for Russia.
Looking for Capital
Co far Lemass has had few problems
raising cash inside Ireland and from
Irish resources. But he admits he may
have to go outside in the future. His
inducements to get foreign industries
operating inside Ireland huve not, all
things considered, cost him that much.
Total capital involved in new industries
with foreign participation which has gone
into production since 1960 is now more
than £26 million sterling. This includes
a few firms who did not seek Govern-
ment grants which in themselves amount
to some £l4 million sterling.
Politically Ireland is now fairly
stable as stable possibly as any in
Europe. Lemass and his Fianna Fail
Party now look a safe bet to be reinstated
with a good majority when the country
goes to the polls next year. When he
does it is tipped he will replace his Old
Guard Cabinet with a new and youthful
group more suited to the new Ireland.
For although his greatest wish is to see
the six Protestant States reunited with
the Republic, Lemass seems to realise
this is secondary to the welfare and econ-
omic fortunes of his people.
The young have shorter memories.
“The unfortunate country,” as the Irish
once called it, is unfortunate no more.
The Ireland of superstition, suppression
and hate belongs to a generation ago . . .
a generation the young, in their new-
found prosperity, don’t really want to
know about. As I say, the leprechauns
have gone, there can’t be many who
want to see them back.


AUSCHWITZ-
the tenth planet
Evidence from another time
From SYBILLE BEDFORD in Frankfurt
The first witness is a German house-
wife who used to live at Ausch-
witz; the town, not the camp. She
appears reluctant. No, she couldn’t
remember the other day though she
thinks that she remembers now —yes, it
is quite possible that Camp-Adjutant
Mulka, Accused No. 1, when he used to
come and see her during the war had
told her about subterranean gas cham-
bers and special commandos, “those
poor swine of prisoners” who were made
to burn the bodies before getting burned
Themselves.
The presiding judge says temperately,
“Frau Rainich, surely that was some-
thing harder to forget than to remem-
ber?”
The witness answers lightly, “We-
talked of so many things . . .” she is
seated in a' small armchair in front of
a table and a microphone. All at once
she volunteers, “Oh, there was one in-
cident I forgot to mention at the pre-
vious hearing. There was an enormous
fire at the camp one night—l think it
was Easter Week, 1944—the sky all lit
up and huge black clouds of smoke—
it must have been Good Thursday or
perhaps Ash Wednesday . . .”
The judge corrects this.
“Well, Good Friday. It was a big
fire —we were nervous —we were afraid
it might be a revolt in the camp. (She
looks round as if for confirmation.) You
see, the prisoners wouldn’t have been
very tender with us. Then my Polish
servants —who (a little laugh) always
seemed to be better informed than we
were —told us that the fire was caused
by British bombers. Next morning an
SS-man called.
“He said to me, ‘Don’t you worry, the
matter is quite in order. It was a potato
fire’. He was speaking in front of my
Poles, you see. So I took him into the
smoking-room and when we were alone,
over a liqueur, he told me, ‘We were
burning Jews last night’. ‘How is that
possible?’ I said, ‘not in the open air?’
Yes, he said, they were burning them,
the bodies, in open fire pits, with gut-
ters to collect the fat (which prisoners
standing by with long-handled scoops
had to feed back into the flames); child-
ren were thrown in alive. Yes, that
was what the SS-man told me.”
In the public gallery there are some
50 very young people. Some have come
in groups with a teacher, some have
come on their own. They are boys and
girls with the jeans and sweaters, the
hair-dos and faces of the young today;
whatever they will grow, or not grow,
into, at present they look like a crowd
of boys and girls in Manchester or
Chicago or Milan and a blessed sight
they are here. What they have just
heard has become a commonplace ex-
change before that court.
Everybody knows that it is true. Yet
it is not even useful evidence. The SS-
man who brought that tale that morning
may be dead, he may be prospering in
South America; he may well be living
down the street under another name.
It was not his trial.
A wretched sense of inadequacy hangs
over these proceedings. What has en-
dured at Auschwitz and what was in-
flicted is of. such magnitude that human
agency cannot resolve it. The heart
cannot take in suffering on that scale,
the will cannot contend with wickedness
so measureless and diseased. Pity and
anger are inadequate; the law is inade-
quate—no law is, could be, shaped to
grapple with enormities such as these.
Comment is inadequate. And what of
punishment? And yet, a letting-off
would be an offence to morality, justice,
the sense of fate itself.
SS-doctor
I he job, such as it is, has got to be
A done. It is being done at Frank-
furt in what is probably the one per-
missible way. The slow, lumbering,
criminal trial has been going on for
more than 14 months now; nearly 300
witnesses have been heard and there
are still more to come. The events of
Auschwitz have long been proved far
and beyond the faintest doubt; the year’s
work has been (and is still) trying to
establish link by minute link the indi-
vidual guilt of the 20 men here accused.
It is established that all were at
Auschwitz, connived, did their part, kept
silence. But in this court now only
murder goes. Prosecution for maltreat-
ment, cruelty, torture (unless it leads to
death) has already lapsed by virtue of
the German Statute of Limitations.
None of the accused so far has ad-
mitted guilt, technically or morally. If
some of these things were done —to
inferiors, to enemies, to rabble—it was
not —and there they become eloquent—
when / was there. I was away, on sick
leave, off duty, transferred; it happened
on another day, in another block, under
another man. To prove the opposite,
after 20 years, is not easy. Most of
those who knew are dead. Documents
are dispersed or lost; it truly happened
in another country: Auschwitz is now
Polish territory.
Much has been proved since the trial
opened two days before Christmas,
1963. Then there were nine men in
custody and 13 out on bail; Now only
seven are on bail; 13 in custody—(the
original nine and four —Mulka, Dr
Capesius, Dylewski, Schlage—who were
arrested in open court at various times
in 1964.) (Of the original 22 accused,
one has died; another is in hospital.)
One of the major tasks, perhaps the
task, of the prosecution is to prove the
guilt of the organisers without whom the
murder machine would have broken
down. Among the seven on bail is one
Bernard Lucas, who was an SS-doctor
at the camp. He is charged with having
carried out what was called Selections.
To select was to select for death; it
was an instant process.
The system has been made familiar
enough by previous evidence, A “trans-
port” would have been announced to the
camp Kommandantur by telephone:
“748 Jews from Holland.” The train, a
string of cattle trucks, arrived at the
subsidiary camp, Birkenau, and drew
up opposite a ramp. A detachment of

SS, equipped with revolvers, whips and
dogs, would be there to meet it. On
the ramp also stood a selector, usually a
doctor. Men, women and children, in
a state of great exhaustion, misery and
fear, were ordered out and driven past.
By the moving of an arm or by a word,
the selector would indicate the side they
were to go —to one side those who
looked still fit enough to work for a
few weeks or months, and so to live;
to the other the old, the sick, the weak.
These would. be. sent into the gas.
Dr Lucas has steadily denied ever
having been on duty on the ramp.
Recently some witnesses came forward
to say that Dr Lucas had been good to
them in camp, that he had “been the
exception", had helped to save them.
Today something happened for the first
time in the whole 14 months of the trial,
an outright denunciation of one accused
by another.
Only a little man
Tn mid-morning, Dr Raabe, one of the
A counsel, asked leave to put a
question to the accused Baretzki. “What
can you tell us about Dr Lucas’s activity
on the ramp?”
Baretzki: Nothing.
Counsel: Did you not see Dr Lucas
selecting on the ramp?
Baretzki: (Curtly) I cannot answer
that 100 per cent.
Counsel: How am I to take that? Can
you answer me 90 per cent? 80 per
cent? You, yourself, were very fre-
quently occupied on the ramp.
Baretzki has been speaking from the
back-bench, guarded by police,
Now he talks very fast and loud, in
harsh broken German. “I couldn’t look
at him all the time—l had my own work
to see to. But if he was there: he must
have been selecting.”
Was he there?
“Yes!”
Was he selecting?
Baretzki waves his arms. One can see
that he has grown very thin. “Only
doctors selected— he was the only doctor
on the ramp.” Words come tumbling
out: “I am a little man —I was only a
Block-Fuehrer—now we get all the blame
. . . These big gentlemen—today they say
they knew nothing about it. But I’m
not blind and I’m not dumb! Lucas—
he was on the ramp. Of course he
selected! Today he is playing the
savior—well, maybe he did help a few
people—in 1945! —he was buying him-
self a return ticket. But before! Before,
he sent 500 into the gas in half an hour
—he sent 5000 into the gas, 10,000 .. .”
Dr Lucas, a heavy, middle-aged man,
grey suit, grey hair, rises slowly and
says in a low, unhappy voice, “I am
not playing the savior. That is only
what witnesses have said here.”
This sets Baretzki off again. “There

was Camp Mexico —that was one of the
worst—-they had no clothes, the people,
no blankets, they were lying naked on
the floor, they had no water. I had to
take them one barrel of water in the
morning, one barrel of water for a
thousand people. Lucas could have
helped—he did nothing.”
The judge: “It hardly needed a medi-
cal man. Why didn't yoit take some
more water?”
, Baretzki (beside himself): “Not with-
out orders. I was ordered one barrel of
water. When I spoke about it they said,
‘Baretzki, get it into your head, THESE
PEOPLE ARE JEWS’.”
There can be no doubt, unfortunately,
that the Frankfurt trial is a controver-
sial subject. Many Germans are whole-
heartedly, passionately, behind it; others
condemn these prosecutions as a shame-
ful dredging of the past, an assault on
German honor and the blackening of
her good name abroad. These write to
the newspapers—who valiantly continue
covering the trial—threatening to cancel
their subscriptions.
A majority does not wish to think
about such things at all. When one
mentions Auschwitz, there will be a lame
remark. Yes, a dismal business. Rather
a black chapter, and no follow-up at all.
Those of the accused who still live at
home are by no means treated as out-
casts by their communities. On the
other hand, witnesses have expressed the
fear that letting it get known that they
were once prisoners in a concentration
camp will do them little good.
Meanwhile, the court has announced
its decision about Dr Lucas: There will
be no arrest. There are two more IG
Farben executives to be heard. The
tenor of their evidence and attitudes is
much alike.
A reporter in the gallery covers his
face. ‘’They’ve learnt nothing. They’ve

Into the Gutter
Damping down the differences in Moscow
By EDWARD CRANKSHAW
The abortive international conference
of Communists ended in Moscow
with a small sigh of relief. The
only lively thing about it had been the
noises off: outside Russia, the fulmina-
tions of the Chinese and the Albanians;
inside, the violent clash between Asian
students and Russian police in front of
the American Embassy.
The anti-American demonstration,
which turned into an ugly anti-Russian
riot when Soviet mounted police started
riding down their Asian guests was
clearly instigated by Peking to coincide
with the conference meeting in complete
secrecy in another part of the city to
embarrass the Russians and to bring to
the surface in Moscow itself differences
which Mr Kosygin and his colleagues are
vainly trying to damp down.
Some of the abuse shouted by Korean
and Vietnamese students at the Soviet
police and the military, who later ad-
vanced on them in a solid phalanx, was
taken straight from the Chinese Press.
For the first time in Russia though by
no means for the first time in China —
the great quarrel, translated into racial
terms, was brought out of conference
rooms and editorial offices and into the
gutter.
It was against this background that
the conference found it expedient to
demand the instant withdrawal of
United States forces from Vietnam. The
Russians must be very harassed indeed.
Already we are hearing from China
about the bloody intervention of Soviet
police in the service of America, beating
down revolutionary students.
The conference itself was scarcely the
shadow of what it should have been.
As originally planned for December, it
was to be a climacteric in Khrushchev's
conflict with Mao Tse-tung. Repre-
sentatives of 26 parties were to assemble
in Moscow to prepare the way for a
grand conference of all the parties which
would end either in China’s submission
or in the Chinese being drummed out of
the Communist movement.
China’s response was to declare that
the day this conference opened would
be the day on which the Soviet Commu-
nist Party dug its own grave. Many
pro-Soviet parties objected to the con-
ference for a variety of reasons —always
ostensibly because of the risk of irre-
vocably splitting the Communist bloc.
Some believed in this excuse; others
knew that the irrevocable split had taken
place, but preferred in their own national
interest to preserve the confusion and
the resultant flexibility (flavoring their
individual independence) of the status
quo.
After Khrushchev's fall the confer-
ence was postponed while his successors
tried to mend fences with the Chinese.
It is believed that Mao Tse-tung told
Mr Kosygin in Peking that China would
attend the conference only if the Rus-
sians formally repudiated the whole of
Khrushchev’s anti-Chinese line and
apologised for it.
This was not on. Although some of
Khrushchev’s colleagues may have ob-
jected to his forcing tactics, all of them
must have agreed on the necessity
of resisting the over-weening Chinese
challenge to the Soviet position, (ofns)

Charity is Not Enough
The Australian wheat gift to India
By SIBNARAYAN RAY
Australia’s recent generous offer to
India of -an immediate and uncon-
ditional gift of 150,000 tons of
wheat, worth nearly £A4 million, is a
most welcome gesture of practical good-
will. It will help to meet a critical grain
shortage facing India over the next
month or so until the Indian crop is
harvested.
While congratulating the Federal Gov-
ernment on its decision, it is only fair
to recall that the proposal for a sub-
stantial wheat gift to India was originally
mooted nearly ten months ago when that
country was faced with its worst food
shortage since independence. I believe
Mr B. A. Santamaria was the first Aus-
tralian to make the appeal on May 10
last year in his weekly TV commentary,
“Point of View”. Subsequently, on June
17, a group of academics, authors and
public men sponsored a petition request-
ing the Federal Government to divert
as a free gift to India one million tons
of Australia’s wheat exports to China.
A campaign was launched, largely at
the initiative of the Melbourne University
DLP Club, and by October about 25,000
signatures to the petition had been col-
lected from all over Australia. Eventu-
ally, the petition was presented to
Parliament by Mr Donald Chipp, MFIR.
The campaign received wide publicity
and a considerable measure of public
support, especially from an influential
section of the daily Press.
It may, therefore, not be altogether
wide of the mark to presume that the
present offer is at least partly in response
to articulate public demand in this
country. The Prime Minister implied as
much when announcing the decision.
He said that the gift was sure to meet
with the warm approval of the Australian
people, “who had shown a keen interest
in and desire to help the Indian people
in their present difficulties”. To many
admirers of Australia like myself, the
really surprising thing is that it took the
Federal Government so long to make
the decision, and even now it does not
seem part of a realistic national policy,
the need for which was. so persuasively
argued by the sponsors of the petition.
In fact, it was the larger policy im-
plications of the gift which provoked
significant resistance to the proposal, and
which presumably contributed to delay-
ing a decision. The sponsors of the
petition had argued that a gift of wheat
in India’s desperate need was no mere
gesture of charity but was basically in
Australia’s interest. They pointed out
that in view of the growing threat of
Communist totalitarianism in South and
South - East Asia this country badly
needed stable democratic allies in this
region; and that by helping India in
its hour of distress Australia would
strengthen the forces of democracy in
Asia and thus contribute to its own
security against the long arm of Red
China. The folly of Australia’s increas-
ing dependence on the Chinese market
for its wheat exports and of discrimina-
tory price and credit terms in favor of
an expansionist dictatorship was severely
attacked. The sponsors suggested that
the proposed wheat gift should mark
“We are both living on
borrowed time. Austra-
lia’s generous gift of
wheat to India will mean
little unless it is followed
by closer political, econo-
mic and strategic collabor-
ationy
the beginning of a bold policy re-
orientation which would draw Australia
closer to India, both politically and
economically.
Resistance to this proposal ranged
from official inertia and indecision
through commercial reluctance to dis-
engage from an established market (even
though this might leave the country open
to political blackmail) to Left-wing
ideological hostility to any programme
that involved explicit commitment
against Communism. The Federal Gov-
ernment maintained that India did not
need any wheat, that in any case no
assistance could be offered without
official request from the Indian Govern-
ment. Spokesmen of the Australian
Wheat Board denied that there was any
discrimination but refused to reveal the
credit terms to China; they stressed that
Communist China was a good customer
and that in business profit had precedence
over politics. Besides, making a gift was
the prerogative of the Government and
not within the competence of the Board.
Left-wing intellectuals and politicians
were agreeable to support the gift pro-
vided it was offered on exclusively
humanitarian grounds; any reference to
Communist China had to be scrupulously
avoided. In effect, however, many of
them proved to be the most vocal critics
of the proposal, in private as well as
public. Not a few among them told me
personally that its purity had been
irredeemably contaminated by associa-
tion with Mr Santamaria.
Since, however, the decision to make
a gift rested with the Federal Govern-
ment, the important point was to meet
or modify the latter’s condition that
request for help should first come
officially from India. It is not altogether
easy to appreciate the protocol con-
siderations behind this insistence, since a
gift to be meaningful is normally
expected to be spontaneous. The
attitude of the Indian Government was
no less unhelpful. It went to the Govern-
ment of the United States for help, but
refrained obstinately for a long time
from approaching Australia. One may
only guess some of the reasons for this
reluctance. Australia’s insistence on
cash payment for wheat purchases in
the past (while China received liberal
credit terms) was not likely to encourage
hopes for a generous response to any
such approach. Nevertheless, early in
January this year, the Indian Prime
Minister, faced with an unexpected
shortfall in arrivals of PL-480 wheat
from the USA, officially approached the
Federal Government for one million
tons of wheat. Belying all earlier mis-
givings, the response at this end has been
prompt and generous. Besides the offer
of a gift, it may now be reasonably
hoped that the Indian Food Minister
during his visit to this country would
negotiate substantial wheat purchases on
terms much more favorable than in the
past.
The basic issue, however, still re-
mains to be clearly confronted by states-
men in both countries. Australia
and Asia today, like England and Europe
thirty years ago, are living on borrowed
time. There is an urgent need for
closer political, economic and strategic
collaboration in this region based on the
recognition that Communist China today
presents a similar threat to the free
peoples of this area that Nazi Germany
presented to Europe in the ’thirties.
Such collaboration, however, involves
important changes in current attitudes
and policies, no less in India than in
Australia or other threatened countries.
The offer of a food gift, however gener-
ous, and its acceptance, however grate-
ful, will mean mighty little unless it
is a prelude to such changes in the two
countries.

Letters to the Editor
“Toda-San”
SIR. —It appears that the play “Toda-
San”, by Hal Porter, which was the
subject of a very tactful and sympathe-
tic review by Mr Geoffrey Dutton
(8., March 6), has been chosen as Aus-
tralia’s contribution to the Common-
wealth Drama Festival in London.
Whatever the merits of the play, it seems
rather surprising that the image of Aus-
tralia on this occasion will be reflected
by two lecherous young men and two
foul-mouthed harridans, unlike the chief
Japanese characters who are nothing if
not noble and self-sacrificing. Surely
a play could have been found which,
while less exotic in its setting, would
have reflected some of the more admir-
able qualities of the Australian charac-
ter.

The Film Industry
SIR.—Mr Giorgio Mangiamele, who
produced and directed the film “Clay”,
has given us proof that the Australian
film industry is ready to make an im-
portant mark, on a very good level, in
the world. I am appalled at the lack
of general interest in Mr Mangiamele’s
superb artistic contribution to Australian
culture. Mr Mangiamele's film was
such a moving lyrical work of art and,
apart from superb photographic crafts-
manship, the metaphysical and aesthetic
implications were subtle and poetically
handled and an added experience for
those who were capable of seeing it.
Why don’t the proper sources,
Government or otherwise, give financial
assistance and recognition now? I take
my hat off to Giorgio Mangiamele, and
he, for one, among others, is ready to
make a worthy contribution to the
world jn the name of the film industry.

Australian Poetry
SIR.-r-Mr N. Bougrelas (8., March 6)
attacks R. A. Simpson for noting favor-
ably the. influence of poets of the 1920 s
on the poetry of people like yours truly.
(“I’m a Cummings man, myself,” he
said.) If susceptibility to influence in
such matters as style is an indictable
offence who shall escape a whipping?
Certainly not those of whom Mr Bou-
grelas speaks! Robert Creeley is not
above the “Cummingesque style” at
times himself:
“what
can we do against
it or else, shall we and
why not, buy a goddam big car,
drive, he sd, for
Christ's sake, look
out where yr going.”
Robert Duncan, another horse from
Mr Bougrelas’ stable, owes a not incon-
siderable debt in some respects to Carlos
Williams and Sandburg who was not
altogether without stylistic obligation to
Whitman who—-but why proceed? We
are all indebted to the past to a recog-
nisable extent. . It is what we do with
our inheritance that matters.
Robert Bly, to take another of the
examples quoted, is not craven before
his influences. Nor are the other
Americans Mr Bougrelas quotes. And,
while it might be agreed that cubist/
futurist/concretist poetry does not get
much of a look-in here, as yet —there’
is work being published in The
Bulletin and elsewhere which is every
bit as flexible and tense with the pre-
sent-day world. Though not enough,
I agree . . . Norman Talbot, for example,
appears to me one such poet, Tim Bass
another —and both have had poetry in
The Bulletin in the past year . . . Mr
Bougrelas did not appear to be balancing
Mr Simpson's far-from-rigid comments
against any personal evaluation of his
own. With all due respects, this gives
his protestations an unnecessarily stri-
dent note.

“The Catholic Worker”
SlR.—May we make a plea for atten-
tion? Attention to the issues raised in
the No. 5 issue of the broadsheet “Cri-
tic” and commented on and enlarged by
you in The Bulletin article “New
Catholic Split” (February 6). In that
“Critic” and in your article serious
charges were levelled at the lay maga-
zine “The Catholic Worker”. To our
knowledge these charges have yet to
be answered in any way that is serious
and not supercilious or contemptuous
of the charges.
' As co-editors of “Critic” and signa-
tories to the body of the “Critic” article,
may we recapitulate the essence of our
attack on the “CW”. We do this in the
hope that by throwing the original
charges in the lap of the editorial com-
mittee of the “CW” they may yet feel
obliged to answer the substance of. the
original articles and not rest content
with a pathetic pose of high disdain or
the factual trivia of Mr Keating’s or
Mr Butler's letters (8., February 20).
We said that the comments of the
“CW” columnist “Marum” on Inter-
national Communism over the years
were fatuous and unworthy of inclusion
in a magazine serious in its claims to
enlightened opinion. We alleged that
the “CW” use of “Pacem in Terris”
was illegitimate in so far as it used a
papal encyclical to justify the “CW’s”
special and misleading use of the term
dialogue. “Dialogue” with Communists
at a peace conference, we averred, leads
to manipulation of the politically unso-
phisticated sections of the population.
We further alleged that the “CW”
treatment of the peace conference was
incredibly naive, if not downright in-
competent. We still stand by these
charges. But we have grave doubts.
Will it be possible to have the issues
discussed for their objective merits and
not as ciphers in someone’s game of
random mental associations?

REVIEWS
ART
The End of Isolation?
By JOHN RUSSELL
In a recent, widely quoted article in
“The Sunday Time's” John Russell
examined the possible effects of the
Power Bequest's proper implementation
on the Australian artistic scene. Simul-
taneously, he prepared a special report
for The Bulletin.
In art there is no substitute for first-
hand experience. Whatever the virtues
of the imaginary museum pioneered by
Andre Malraux, they are addressed
primarily to the man who enjoys art
and not to the man who makes it. For
this reason no amount of books and
magazines will remedy the basic short-
coming of the Australian art situation.
That shortcoming does not derive from
any failing on the part of Australia’s
artists. Nor does it derive as it does in
other countries from lack of public
support. One of the things that strike
a visitor is the consistent enthusiasm of
Australians for Australian art and their
genuine desire to do their best for it.
What is wrong with Australian art is,
quite simply, isolation.
By isolation, I mean again quite
simply a lack of contact with recent
works of art and with the idea structure
which brought them into being. The
first could be put right by loan exhibi-
tions larger, better chosen and more
frequent than those sent hitherto. The
second could be put right by personal
contact. Contact through the written
word has its advantages and is certainly
“better than nothing” but where new
art is concerned the written w'ord of
necessity leaves out much that can be
intimated in personal exchanges and
assumes much, in the way of a com-
mon background of ideas and experi-
ence, which may not exist and would
in such cases be a source of confusion.
Let us take some practical examples.
Australia has not to my knowledge seen
anything much of the Ecole de Paris
since the loan show from the Musee
National D’Art Moderne toured in 1953.
That show gave at best a partial idea
of what was going on in Paris. The
Michener Collection more recently gave
at best a partial impression of what had
gone on in America. The fact that we in
England have never Fiad so lively a
younger generation in either painting or
sculpture can mean little to people who
have not actually seen the work in
question, because both the paintings and
the sculptures depend for a large part
of their impact on questions of scale,
texture, handling and basic material.
Nor can even the experience of the
original work give a complete idea of
the mind behind it: and in the case of
the younger British artists that mind is
exceptionally lucid, resourceful and
articulate.
Two things, then, seem to me to be
lacking from the Australian art situa-
tion today. One is the new work of
art from overseas in the context of
which all other new works of art make
sense. The other is human contact: and
I do not mean by this the man who
comes for a single luncheon like the
one to which I was invited not long
ago in Watson’s Bay. I mean the man
who is accessible day in day out until
interested people know him thoroughly.
For lack of these there is a basic
anxiety about the Australian art world
which hampers and inhibits even those
who seem most securely at home in
their Australian context. (The Aus-
tralian artist who leaves Australia has
of course problems of another kind.)
Now, as every interested Australian
knows, the University of Sydney can
change all this overnight. When
Doctor Power left two million pounds
to the University his intentions w'ere
clear, disconcerting as they may be to
those who see living art as a cranky,
unworthy and unteachable subject. He
wanted the people of Australia to be
at home wdth “the latest ideas and
theories in the plastic arts”. He envisaged
“lectures and teaching and the purchase
of the most recent contemporary art of
the world ... so as to bring the people
of Australia into more direct touch
with the latest art developments of
other countries”. One could hardly
define more succinctly the current needs
of the Australian art world.
So w'hat is holding it up? By speak-
ing of “a faculty of fine arts”, Dr
Power made it possible for his inten-
tions to be dissipated in a confusion
of committees weakened by a shift of
emphasis towards a renaissance-orien-
tated conception of art history and
weighed down with massive buildings,
examination schedules and a complex
of intramural obligations. If every pur-
chase, every lecture and every projected
exhibition has to be ratified by a com-
mittee of whom the majority know little
of living art the result would clearly
fall a long way short of the testator’s
intentions. It was for this reason and
in search of an acceptable compromise
that Professor John White from Man-
chester University was invited to Syd-
ney last year. According to all accounts,
Professor White did all that any one
man could do to reconcile the terms
of the will with the apprehensions of
the academic world. But although the
University is the appointed administra-
tor of the Power bequest it was not in
Dr Power’s mind the prime beneficiary
of that bequest.
The bequest was not meant to pro-
vide a presentable and exotic garnish
on the syllabus of the University. It
was meant to provide Sydney with the
things which we in London now take
for granted: the loan exhibitions of
high quality, the stream of visiting
artists and critics, the schools jumping
with new ideas. The prime beneficiaries
of all this would be the Australian artist
and his loyal audience.
When it comes, for instance, to
teaching “the latest developments in art”,
the most effective instrument is the
major loan show which, like “the new
American painting” in London in 1959,
breaks open the subject once and for
all. The Power bequest could, for
instance, take over, to name two only,
the “London, the New Scene” exhibi-
tion, w'hich is having so great a suc-
cess in Minneapolis, and the current
“Responsive Eye” from the Museum of
Modern Art in New York. Next in line
at the discretion of the eventual pro-
fessor-director would be the presence
for several months in each year of a
painter-educator of the first rank: some-
one as familiar with the idea structure
of living art as with the works of art
to which that structure gives rise. And
although universities have a natural bias
towards the ageing “safe choice” who
might well nullify Dr Power’s inten-
tions, there are senior artists like Marcel
Duchamp who are part of the legend
of living art and might well be coaxed
southwards for a spell. I am presuming
in all this that Australian art is worth
bothering about and that Dr Power
also believed this. I do not believe that
his intention was simply to educate an
elite to make the most of their next
trip to Europe or America. Nor do I
believe that the only salvation for an
Australian artist is to leave his own
country.
The desirable thing is for him to
have at home the things, or a large
number of them, for which he now
dreams of getting away. The point of
the Power bequest is that most of those
things could be put in his way without

any departure from the principle of
University control. They would more-
over be available to students from other
faculties as an unexpected and yeasty
ingredient in their careers. Sydney Uni-
versity has already in the Fisher Lib-
rary a masterpiece of post-war Australian
architecture. Next to it is a space which
could shelter not one ot the neo-classical
fortresses which all over the world spell
“art gallery” but a pleasure dome as _
original as Louisiana, near Copenhagen,
or Philip Johnson’s recent annexe to
Dumbarton Oaks. The isolation of the
Australian artist could be ended as of
now if the wish were strong enough.
Meanwhile the interest on the Power
bequest is piling up and it would have
been possible to buy, for instance, the
whole of the current “New Generation,
1965” exhibition at the Whitechapel
without making any appreciable inroad
into it. Without entering into direct
competition with either the Felton
bequest or the Department of Art His-
tory at Melbourne University, Sydney
could establish itself at one stroke as
one of the five or six cities in the world
that really count in the study and
patronage of living art. This is what
Dr Power had in mind that the
people of Australia should take to living
art as naturally as they take to their
beaches.
FILMS
The Sad Sisters
The Silence. Director, Ingmar Bergman.
Gala Theatre, Sydney.
Toys In The Attic. Director, George Roy
Hill. Mayfair Theatre, Sydney.
Send Me No Flowers. Director, Norman
Jewison. State Theatre, Sydney.
Ingmar Bergman’s films have been sub-
jected to more dissection, more critical
interpretation than any other director’s
body of work. No doubt some of the
meanings deduced were indeed the
director’s, either deliberately or sub-
consciously; other interpretations, I sus-
pect, inspire in Bergman the wintry
smile which with him passes for a good
old laugh.
His films are of course intensely subtle,
tightly packed with imagery and implica-
tion, occasionally obscurantist due to
an irresistible impulse towards intel-
lectual-baiting. But their basic themes
seem to me straightforward and simple.
Once these are recognised and accepted,
the films present only surface difficulty.
You may not probably won’t com-
prehend all of what Bergman is saying,
but his basic message is straightforward,
clear and incisive.
As a director Bergman is almost
unique in having gained total acceptance
of his own personal view of life;
apparently there’s no Swedish front office
strong enough to protest successfully
against his ingrained, coldly resigned
pessimism, which informs even his so-
called “comedies”. To him, as to
choreographer Lew Christensen, life is
a “do-it-yourself disaster”.
In the three films he refers to as a
trilogy, of which “The Silence” is the
last, he interprets his vision of a world
brought into being by a God who has
contemptuously thrown aside his im-
perfect creation, leaving its inhabitants
uselessly seeking in each other the
warmth they expect from a maker who
has rejected them.
Deprived of God, people force love
and closeness upon each other, with the
inevitable result of disillusion and de-
struction.
- The films of the trilogy have been
smaller in compass (though not in their
wide implications) than some of his
earlier work. “Through A Glass Darkly”
dealt with four members of a family
disastrously holidaying on a remote
island; “Winter Light” (not seen here)
was the story of a disillusioned village
pastor and his hopeless flock. “The
Silence”, too, has few significant charac-
ters —two sisters, a small boy, a waiter —-
and locks them for most of the film in
a plushy, outdated provincial hotel in
a strange country. Here the sisters are
forced into a steamy intimacy which

forces their long-incubated hatred to its
final flowering.
After so much overseas discussion of
the film it is hardly necessary to say
that it’s about the Lesbian-incestuous
relationship of the sisters and its effect
on the small son of the younger. Forced
by her illness to break their journey in
a foreign towm, the sick Ester is im-
prisoned wdth her physical and mental
anguish; Anna, seeing a final chance of
escape, defiantly parades her brief
liaison with a barman..
The child, intuitive but uncompre-
hending, finally accepts his first lesson in
disillusionment—his realisation that his
idolised mother has from desperation
performed an act of brutal, selfish
destruction.
Throughout the film Bergman presents
a negative view of accepted emotional
standards. Both sensual and family love
are destructive. Anna seeks liberation in
the meaningless embraces of a stranger,
while Ester and the boy find their only
glimpse of goodwill in the casual kind-
ness of the hotel waiter, an incompre-
hensible foreigner—whose cheer-up gift
to the child, incidentally, consists of a
set of postcards depicting a family
funeral.
The acting, as usual with Bergman, is
beyond criticism, with Ingrid Thulin and
Gunnel Lindblom vying for honors as
the sisters, and a sinister, equivocal per-
formance from Haakon Jahnberg as the
waiter. (The equation made by some
critics of this character with a kindliness
only just this side of the divine, seems to
me nonsensical.)
This is incest week at the cinema:
“Toys In The Attic”, based on a Lilian
Heilman play, deals with the fermenting
passion of a sister for her younger
brother. The theatrical origins of the
script are creakily obvious in George
Roy Hill's stagey direction, but there are
some beautifully played scenes between
Geraldine Page as the unnaturally
devoted spinster and Wendy Hiller as
the loving eider sister who tries to avert
the inevitable (and very awkwardly
managed) denouement.
Some light relief: the Canadian Nor-
man Jewison’s “Send Me No Flowers”
though even this, for a Doris Day-
Rock Hudson comedy, has dark under-
tones, since it dares to joke about death
and funerals. After a slightly shaky
start, a brisk script and neat direction
make this a genuinely entertaining film.
Hudson, as the healthy hypochondriac
mistakenly convinced of the imminence
of his demise, looks more like a
comedian than I would ever have
believed possible; but he and Doris Day
(who must give up wearing hair-bows),
pleasing as they are, are overshadowed
by the brilliant comedy timing of Tony
Randall as a sympathetic and bibulous
neighbor, and by Paul Lynde as a distres-
singly enthusiastic mortician who loves
his work because “I like people”, and
who in a mordantly funny and macabre
sequence sums up “The American Way
Of Death” in a matter of seconds.

Nolan’s Gallipoli
Toehold in History. Directors, Dahl and
Geoffrey Codings. Liberty Theatre, Syd-
ney.
For several years, Dahl and Geoffrey
Codings have been directing, under con-
siderable difficulties, a remarkable series
of documentaries on Australian art,
sponsored by Qantas. The latest of
these, on release with “The Yellow
Rolls-Royce” throughout the M-G-M
circuit, is “Toehold in History”, a vivid
and strikingly photographed re-creation
of the Gallipoli paintings by Sidney
Nolan, including some works especially
prepared for the film. The problem of
matching the colors, of creating a
powerful flow of images to match the
dynamic impact of the paintings them-
selves, has been triumphantly met, par-
ticularly in the final passages involving
the imaginative use of color to illustrate
the soldiers’ emergence from the blood
of battle to spiritual greatness. The
naked figures break out from the tor-
mented masses of paint to do battle;
a legend is re-created in canvas; and
George Johnston’s commentary effec-
tively underlines the place of the Anzac
forces in the tradition of the “stripped
warrior, fain in the sea to dip”.
CHARLES HIGHAM
THEATRE
Sleeping Beauty
Invitation to a March. Arthur Laurents.
Ensemble Theatre. Sydney.
You Never Can Tell. George Bernard
Shaw. Genesian Theatre, Sydney.
“Invitation to a March” is a mixture of
D. H. Lawrence and Freud translated
into middlebrow theatre. Written by
the author of “West Side Story” the
play is based on the fairy tale of
“Sleeping Beauty”. The beautiful girl is
about to be married to a rich and am-
bitious young lawyer, but she cannot
keep awake. Prince Charming is a
young man who comes to fix the
plumbing, and wakes Sleeping Beauty
with a kiss. His romantic image is com-
plete when we discover that he is illegiti-
mate. Will she choose respect, ability or
Prince Charming? Throughout three
long acts an elaborate dialectic is sustain-
ed regarding this choice. But if the only
way to stay awake is to join the raggle-
taggle gypsies, then there is no choice.
Both Freud and Lawrence have been
accused of exaggerating the importance
of the unconscious part of the mind, so
it is not really surprising that in : the
middlebrow version of their ideas the
unconscious takes over completely, and
its d a r k, confused mutterings become
loud, clear and irresistible.
Patricia Hill gives a good perfor-
mance in the difficult part of the Mother
representing Instinct.
The Genesian Theatre’s new mid-week
season on Wednesdays and Thursdays
supplements the main weekend produc-
tion, at present “Richard of Bordeaux.”
It is designed to exercise the newer
members of the company.
“You Never Can Tell” must be the
nearest Shaw ever came to writing an
orthodox light comedy. Of course the
dialogue has a Shavian wit and liveliness
but the play lacks a larger intellectual
structure. The first act is slow but the
pace improves in the second act, and I
enjoyed it from then on.
The young amateurs give unpolished
but lively performances, though they are
much in need of voice training. Harry
Collins stands out as a more experienced
actor in the part of William the waiter.

BOOKS
Nabokov’s Chess-game
By CHARLES OSBORNE
The Defence. Vladimir Nabokov. Weiden-
feld and Nicolson. 265. 6d.
The latest Nabokov novel to appear in
English is not a recent work. It was
written in 1929 when its author was
living in Berlin, and was published there
the following year in the original Rus-
sian. In a rather charming preface which
he has added for the English edition,
Nabokov reveals that the Russian title
was “Zashchita Luzhina” which means
“the Luzhin defence” and refers to a
style of defence in the game of chess, in-
vented by the novel’s protagonist Luzhin.
That it has taken 35 years for this
beautifully ' conceived and stunningly
written work to be translated is incred-
ible.
The style has much in common with
the more recent of Nabokov’s
novels written in English. His
mastery of the English language
is absolutely magical: it isn’t the
dead, flat mastery of a Conrad:
Nabokov's prose is vivid, poetic
and direct.
Nabokov’s heroes almost al-
ways have immense charm, even
when one is hard put to it to
describe how or why they
are charming. And even when they lack
charm they are still likeable. Humbert
Humbert is one of the pleasantest men
in modern fiction. The pathetic Luzhin,
in “The Defence’’, is a typical Nabokov
hero. When the novel opens he is a child
in pre-Revolution St Petersburg. His
father is a well-known author of boys’
adventure stories, his mother a self-
centred hypochondriac whose condition
is made worse by her husband’s infidelity.
Young Luzhin is not interested in any-
thing. He is a sullen, listless child, and a
great worry to his parents. He is, it
seems, little more than a high-grade
moron. One evening, in a curiously
striking scene that recalls Svevo in its
juxtaposition of the tragic and the banal,
he discovers chess. From that moment he
has an interest in life. But only one in-
terest: chess has given him life, and he,
in turn, gives his life to chess. In time
he becomes a famous international
champion, and for years he travels around
Europe appearing at one chess tourna-
ment after another. In a hotel at a
German health resort he meets a'fellow-
countrywoman who is, like himself at
this stage of his life, an emigre from
Bolshevik Russia. They marry, he suffers
a nervous collapse during one of his
games, and is forced to rest and to forget
about chess. For a time he does forget,
but then the game reclaims him, and
with slow cunning and deviousness he
prepares for his final game. He plays it
with his life.
Such a bare outline of the events not
only makes the book sound like a tract
on the dangers of excessive chess-playing,
but also conveys nothing of the many
surrounding characters such as Luzhin’s
father in old age and decline, his wife’s
parents, his chess impresario,
nor of the hypnotically fas-
cinating world of the Russian
emigre in Berlin in the ’twenties.
Nor, again, does it give any hint
of the compulsive quality of
Nabokov’s description of Luz-
hin’s psychosis, nor of the sheer
brilliance of the novel’s con-
struction which itself resembles
a series of chess moves!
Chess as a metaphor of life is not in
itself a particularly original or striking
conceit, but Nabokov's extraordinary
ability to build the complex edifice of a
novel upon so well-used a foundation is
really a feat of great virtuosity. Through-
out his life, Luzhin is fighting a losing
battle. He is, unknown to himself, fighting
to retain his already tenuous hold on
reality.
It is possible, too, though perhaps he
himself would deny this, that Nabokov in
this novel is saying something about the
nature of virtuosity, or even of genius. As
a chess-player, Luzhin is considered a
genius. As a human being, what is this
genius? Outside the subject of chess, he
is almost completely mindless. He has a
certain dogged, childlike quality that puts
one in mind of Nijinsky who was the
same kind of genius, and whom life de-
feated in the same way. Luzhin is a
man of sub-normal or at any rate re-
tarded intelligence. When he is given a
typewriter, and learns how to use it, he
types: “You are wanted on a charge of
murder. Today is November 27th. Mur-
der and arson. Good day, dear Madam.
Now when you are needed, dear, ex-
clamation mark, where are you? The
body has been found. Dear Madam! To-
day the police will come!” After his
breakdown, he is even more of a sham-
bles than before. Madness is simplicity,
madness is concentrated sanity, madness
is inadequacy and inertia. None of these
assertions is actually explicit in the nar-
rative, yet they are all surely deeply em-
bedded in it.
Perhaps Luzhin’s fatal mistake was to
exchange the discipline of chess for the
altogether different discipline of marriage,
for which he was singularly ill-equipped.
The rules of one game were second nature
to him: the rules of the other he was
never to master completely. In a way,
the responsibility for Luzhin’s tragedy
should be shared by his well-meaning
wife, an extremely sympathetic though
somewhat enigmatic character. Her per-
ceptive old mother, who never liked Luz-
hin, remarked surprisingly on being told
of the marriage, “I feel just one thing.
She doesn’t love him.” And Nabokov
places this line so deftly, casually yet
surely, that it is made to seem immensely
touching and significant.
The scenes with Luzhin’s parents-in-law
have a strange poignancy of their own.
The ambivalent expatriates’ world of
Russia-in-Germany is conveyed with
delicacy and ease as a background to the
distracted and perplexed bear who lum-
bers across it, his eyes seeing in the
patterned carpet a chess-board, in the
bathroom tiles a chess-board, and in the
paved courtyard a chess-board.
Nabokov is undoubtedly one of the two
or three finest living novelists. “Lolita”,
which perhaps Australia will be allowed
to read one day, is still his masterpiece,
but “The Defence” is a very welcome
find from the past.

comes when He is obeyed. The contro-
versy should really turn on the validity of
this system of ideas.
I am not finally certain if Driberg con-
siders moral standards should be absolute
or relative, or whether guidance can be
real or not. One could quote sections of
his writings implying both positions. I am
not certain whether he thinks MRA
should become a sect emphasising doc-
trines, rather than an ideology seeking the
will of God in the affairs of men. Possibly
he wishes if would die, but he doesn’t
think it will. Driberg does seem to me
to identify an affirmation of absolute
moral standards with a claim to perfec-
tion. Thornton-Duesbery believes abso-
lute standards to be instruments of con-
stant change, measuring rods to reveal
deficiency.
“If moral standards are relative,”
Thornton-Duesbery writes, “exactly how
much dishonesty should one accept in a
tradesman? How much homosexual
practice should be allowed in a school-
master? To what extent should adultery
be encouraged in a wife? What propor-
tion of lying should pass' muster in the
public utterances of a judge, a bishop, or
a cabinet minister?” In effect Thornton-
Duesbery argues that if a standard is not
absolute it is not a standard at all.
- There have been many books written
on Frank Buchman and MRA over the
years by “outsiders”, and their authors
have in common two things. The first is
that they regarded themselves as under
an obligation to associate with Frank
Buchman over months, or to attend MRA
assemblies over weeks, before they wrote
anything. Driberg claims to have met
Frank Buchman only once, in 1928. The
second is that what they wrote was at
every given point of time at variance with
what Driberg wrote at the same time
from a position of distant hostility. I
refer to “Life Changers” by Harold Beg-
bie (1925); “For Sinners Only” by A. J.
Russell (1931); “Fresh Hope for the
World” by Gabriel Marcel (1958); and
various essays and studies by Sir Arnold
Lunn. They, with Peter Howard, a Fleet
Street journalist, whose investigations led
him to publish “Innocent Men”, but also
fully to associate with MRA and to be-
come director of its world programme,
were with Dr Buchman a long time at
close quarters.
Driberg’s only interview with anyone
actively associated with MRA appears to
have been with Madame Irene Laure,
French Socialist Deputy and former Re-
sistance leader. He belittles her “change”
from hatred of Germany, and its effect.
Madame Laure’s son was tortured by
the Gestapo to make her reveal Resis-
tance secrets, which she did not reveal.
She is denounced as “simple with a kind
of peasant obtuseness” and as having
possessed an outlook which “seems to
have been determined mainly by emo-
tional nationalism”.
Gabriel Marcel has an entirely differ-
ent view of her. I thought her an out-
standing woman dedicated to Franco-
German and Franco-North African re-
conciliation and effective in both fields.
Driberg, who fiercely attacked Dr
Buchman under cover of Parliamentary
privilege, seems to have awaited his
death to write this attack.
I saw Dr Buchman perhaps on 50
occasions over a period of 18 weeks.
Driberg writes that he had “undoubted
hypnotic powers” and a “penetrating
gaze”. This is, of course, an accusation of
sinister domination. Driberg also seems
to believe Buchman’s annual birthday
messages to have been akin to “sermons”.
The statements were circulated in print,
leaving “hypnosis” and '“penetrating
gazes” somewhat at a disadvantage. Dr
Buchman never orated. He was quiet and
slow-spoken, saying anything he had to
say, whenever I saw him, while sitting
down. The clearest memories I have of

him, apart from the attributes of courtesy,
hospitality and a sensitive reticence, were
that he loathed domination of one per-
son by Another almost more than any-
thing else, and he regarded domination as
a root evil, with inevitable by-products of
jealousy, superiority, inferiority, resent-
ment and hate. He never exercised dom-
ination himself.
Secondly, he warmly appreciated peo-
pie who, from conscientious conviction,
told him where they felt he was wrong.
Thirdly, almost his first approach to
anyone was to seek his mind and advice,
Fourthly, he believed that the transforma-
tion of character “God-wards” would
produce, from a sensitized conscience, the
kind of social transformation Wilberforce
and Shaftesbury produced in particular
fields. Driberg is angered by his lack of
a political programme, but Dr Buchman
believed valid programmes would come
from the consciences of morally sensitized
men. These would be statesmen and state-
craft would follow. This is, of course, the
reversal of materialism. MRA always
seems to draw an ideological and philo-
sophic battle line and the two books are
expressions of opposite sides of the line.

The Unlucky Country
The Italians. Luigi Barzini. Hamish Hamil-
ton. 38s. 6d.
Italy is like a team of champion foot-
ballers which never wins a match.
Italians, it seems, have genius but not
character. Luigi Barzini, Liberal parlia-
mentarian and journalist son of a
famous foreign correspondent, identi-
fies the historical sources of the Italian
national defects. Italians are used to
violent upheavals, to men dying for
their ideals one year and dying because
of them the next, to living on after
ideals have crashed. This does not
necessarily result in cynicism: an
ideological vitality is shown by the com-
plete range of political parties from neo-
Fascists through Monarchists across to
Communists. But it does cause pessi-
mism. At the same time, as the future
is likely to be as black as the past, it
encourages enjoyment of the passing
moment.
When history brings so many
scourges, when the State is oppressive,
the bureaucracy cruelly slow and
government unstable, the best defence is
family and friends. A Mafia prevails
throughout Italy. It is not the criminal
Mafia of Western Sicily but the mutual
benefit society of a people who recog-
nise that all the superstructures of
State, political parties, power and dogma
in every form are to be foiled and re-
sisted. This is the Italian resistance
movement to the overwhelming forces
which history has brought to play on
them: not only invaders and tyrants but
also the Church. As the centre of a
world-wide faith, the Vatican over-
shadows other elements in national life.
No foreigner cares what the Italian Pre-
sident says but Papal encyclicals appear
in full in the “New York Times” and
the exact sense of the Italian original is
keenly discussed. Pope John’s “aggiorna-
mento” was the last Italian word to
travel the world. Italian as an inter-
national language exists only when used
by the 'Pope, the head of a foreign State.
There is a final turn of the screw.
According to Barzini, Italians are not
merely victims. They are responsible
for the anarchy of their national life:
lack of character is destiny. Foreign-
ers fascinated by the gaiety, the charm
of Italy do not discern the fundamental
melancholy of this people condemned
to amuse themselves and the world, to
resort to spectacle and illusion as an
escape from the dreariness of existence.
This desire to decorate, to render the
unbearable pleasant means that the
periodic catastrophes are inevitable as
problems are never resolved.
It is tempting to compare Barzini’s

treatment of the unlucky country with
Donald Horne’s “The Lucky Country”.
There is a basic difference of tone and
attitude. Barzini’s book, which he
describes as a “portrait of the artist’s
mother”, is written with the affection
that survives disenchantment. His tone
is serenely pessimistic; Horne, however,
is determinedly optimistic. “The Lucky
Country” reads, at times, like a populist
tract by a president of the Australian
Republican Party. At times the vision
is apocalyptic, at times there is a tremor
of mystical premonitions, as in a Rus-
sian pre-Revolutionary text, of new
forms of life. But basically it is deter-
minedly optimistic, believing in a change
for the better despite the evidence it
presents.
The difference between the two view-
points is illustrated by the relationship
they see between their countrymen and
ideas. Donald Horne suggests that Aus-
tralians, after all, may not be inimical to
ideas; perhaps it is only that the wrong
ideas have been presented to them.
Barzini’s Italian knows that wrong ideas
are presented to him, maliciously, from
all quarters by people striving for
power: “He must defend himself. He
begins early by being his own school-
teacher (most schools are inadequate)
and professor (universities are poor,
backward and badly run). Later he must
be his own journalist (published news of
internal affairs can be so biased that to
rely on them is to court disaster), his
own literary, film, art, and dramatic
critics (reviews rarely reflect the worth
of the film, book, or drama, but a-
number of factors, the personal relation
between author and critic, their respec-
tive political .parties, relative ages,
philosophical bias, and so forth), his
own strategic expert in times of war
(nobody will tell him who is winning
and when to run until too late), and his
own fiscal expert (to distinguish which
are the taxes to be paid fully, which
only in part, and which to be ignored
altogether).. He must at times be his
own lawyer, policeman and judge. In
short, his security depends not on the
combined exertions of his countrymen
to which he should add his own but
mostly on his individual capacities and
native shewdness.”
Horne warns that if the racket of the
lucky country does not stop Australia
will come a terrible cropper. And he.
believes Australia might make the neces-
sary changes. Barzini, however, is sure
that all Italy's past pratfalls are not
going to save it from similar ones in the
future. There is a strength in this
anarchic society, though, precisely be-
cause of its sufferings: it has proved its
resilience and experienced its limita-
tions.

Winds of the Desert
The Arabs. Anthony Nutting. Hollis &
Carter. 455.
This book is indispensable reading for
anyone who wants to understand the
background to the political upheavals in
the Middle East since World War 11. Into
400 pages Anthony Nutting has packed
a clear, tightly-organised history of the
Arab peoples from Mahomet to Nasser.
It is a remarkable feat of compression
and the author has maintained a sensible
balance between the military and re-
ligious conquests of the great Arab
leaders and the astonishing (and still
popularly underrated) contribution made
by the Arabs to what we regard as purely
“Western” civilisation. I know of no
other recent book that covers :he field
so well in such limited compass.
Nutiing is well qualified for his under-
taking. A protege of Sir Anthony Eden
(whose private secretary he had been), he
entered Parliament after the war and, as
Under-Secretary of State for Foreign
Affairs, plaved an important role in the
tangled negotiations with Eygpt in 1954.
He resigned two years later after the
British attack on the Suez Canal Zone
and since then has been writing and
travelling widely in the Middle East. He
was, incidentally, chief adviser to Sam
Spiegel during the filming of “Lawrence
of Arabia”.
Nutting obviously has a warm admira-

tion for the Arabs, perhaps rather for
the ancient desert stock of Arabia itself,
Iraq, lordan and North Africa, than for
the more sophisticated racial mixtures of
Egypt and Syria. His prejudices become
more apparent as he approaches modern
times. On the contentious subject of
Palestine he has his share of the common
romantic British bias in favor of the
sons of the desert and against the Israeli
newcomers from Central Europe. But he
recognises that the winds of change are
blowing in the Arab world as elsewhere
and he concludes with the commonsense
remark that “the United States and
Britain should avoid favoring the more
archaic of Arabia's sheikdoms and king-
doms”. To ignore such advice is simply
to play into Nasser’s hands by forcing the
Arab people to look to Cairo as the
centre of their economic and nationalistic
aspirations.
In the last 100 pages of his book
Nutting summarises developments in the
Arab States that emerged from the debris
of the Turkish Empire after World War I.
The story of the Balfour Declaration, the
Sykes-Picot Agreement and the oft-de-
nounced British “betrayal” of King Hus-
sein and his family clan is told with
appropriate indignation. It is useful to
have the facts and dates concisely set
down, though some of the author's con-
clusions are arguable. In talking of the
“betrayal” of the Arabs we should re-
member that it took a lot of British prod-
ding to get the celebrated Arab Revolt
moving at all, and, despite subsidies and
supplies of arms, lbn Saud (who was an
Arab princeling at least as important as
Hussein) hardly lifted a finger against the
Turks. After all, Hussein and his sons
came out of all the dust and intrigues
with three kingdoms between them (one,
Hejaz, did not last long), and the rulers
were quite prepared to accept British
tutelage to maintain their existence. It
was pressure from below, encouraged by
Egypt, that finally broke down Britain’s
dominating influence in Arab affairs.
Scores of volumes have been written
about recent Middle East politics, and
Nutting has nothing particularly fresh or
thought-provoking to say upon that topic.
The most valuable parts of his book are
the early sections, especially those dealing
with the seven centuries of Arab splendor
between the death of Mahomet and the
subjection of the Arabs to the yoke of
the Ottoman Turks. No tide of conquest
in history ever flowed so swiftly and with
shattering results as the onrush of Islam.
When the Prophet died in 632 AD his
followers were still struggling to assert
their supremacy over the idolatrous tribes
of the Arabian peninsula. Within the next
50 years the hordes of Islam streamed out
of the desert to overwhelm the decaying
Persian Empire, occupy Mesopotamia,
Syria and Egypt, and overrun all North
Africa to the Straits of Gibraltar. A cen-
tury after Mahomet’s death the black
banner of the Moslem caliphate flew
from the Indus Valley to the Spanish
Pyrenees and from the Aral Sea steppes
to the rocks of Aden.
The first great conquerors were the
caliphs of the Omayyad family which had
seized power from the descendants of the
Prophet. The Golden Age of Arab civil-
isation came with the Abbasid caliphs
who ruled in Baghdad for 500 years until
their capital was obliterated during the
Mongol invasions in the 13th century.
For generations Bagdad and Cordoba
(the seat of a separate caliphate in Spain)
were intellectual beacons shining in the
darkness of the Western World. The
fusion of conquering Arabs with con-
quered Persians, Byzantine Greeks,
Syrians, Egyptians, Sicilians and other
people of the Mediterranean littoral pro-
duced a cultural flowering that almost
surpasses belief.
We have always been so dazzled by
the contemplation of our own cultural
navel, the European Renaissance, with
its lusty neo-Platonic synthesis of Christ-
ian ideals and pagan culture, that we are
apt to forget what we owe to the Arab
pioneers. Avicenna, Averroes and Mai-
monides are relatively familiar names;
but there was a host of others histor-
ians, mathematicians, astronomers, geo-
graphers, botanists and doctors who
were using skills that contemporary
Europe hardly dreamed of.
The seeds of decay were already ap-
parent before the Crusaders butchered
their way into Syria and Palestine. Egypt
and Spain had become independent Mos-
lem States. The rulers of Baghdad were
feeble phantoms, creatures of the harem
and chessboard, while Turkish praetorians
administered the shrinking caliphate.
Then, in 1258, the glory of the Abbasid
caliphs ended forever when Hulagu, the
grandson of Genghis Khan, left Baghdad
a heap of ruins burying a million corpses.
For a while it seemed that the Mame-
luke rulers in Cairo might make Egypt
the new centre of the Islamic world. The
brilliant civilisation of Moslem Spain was
crumbling under the onslaught of the
Christian princes, and successive waves
of Mongols and Turks had reduced the
Near East to chaos.
As it happened, the sceptre of the cali-
phate fell to the Ottoman Turks. Con-
stantinople succeeded Baghdad, and the
Arabs once the warlike standard-
bearers of the Prophet and later the intel-
lectual elite of the Western world—sank
into that subjection to the Turkish sultan
that lasted until 1918.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Dearer Money —Tougher Conditions
Requirements of the bond mar-
ket seem to shine through the
Reserve Bank’s latest move to
raise short-term bank deposit rates by
one-half p.c. The trading banks thus
are enabled to compete more effec-
tively in the short-term money market
field, with the fixed deposit rate for
periods of less than 12 months rising
from 3| p.c. to 4i p.c. The short-
term rate beyond 12 months goes up
to 4J p.c.
Most of the additional funds on
deposit gleaned by the trading banks,
of course, are expected to go into
Commonwealth bonds. If not, the
Reserve Bank can call up extra
amounts into the freezing chamber
called Statutory Reserve Deposits.
If Commonwealth loan raisings
were to be boosted this year to pay
for extra d e fe n c e commitments,
remedial action was necessary in the
short term interest rate and the bond
market is now adjusted to that con-
cept. The question now is whether
savings banks will receive a lift in
interest rates, because the savings
banks are captive subscribers to Com-
monwealth loans.
Failure of the Commonwealth loan
in February was attributed mainly to
the inadequate support for the short-
term portion of the loan, with the
short-term money market dealers hold-
ing off in anticipation of a rise in
interest rates.
The attitude of the money market
dealers was quite understandable, be-
cause they had been burned badly
when interest rates were raised last
year. Even the short-term dealers,
however, must be pleased at the
generous rates now developing in the
short-term end of the bond market,
where the yield is now creeping nearer
to 5 p.c., compared with an effective
rate of £4 9s. Bd. p.c. for 20-month
bonds last February.
This may ensure oversubscription
for the next Commonwealth loan, but
it plays havoc with ordinary share
prices. The sharp rise in interest rate
structure, including a record 7i p.c.
for bank overdraft rate (highest this
century), makes for very hard money
indeed and certainly puts a brake on
borrowings. Doubtless the authorities
are anxious to curb imports in view
of the currently unfavorable balance of
payments outlook. But higher interest
rates also place a restraining hand on
expansion.
The continued trend towards higher
interest rates therefore puts the skids
under ordinary share price yields and
forces the finance companies (and
others) to pitch their borrowing rates
at higher levels to attract public

money. It becomes an expensive era
for borrowing money and inevitably
must have some effect in relieving the
existing strain on the market for labor
and resources. The trend favors the
Government in its capital raisings for
defence expenditure and public works,
but creates problems for private in-
dustry.
Dollar Curbs Hit Japan
TSfORLD stock market reaction to the
'' US restriction on dollar outflow
has been swift, if measured in terms
of share prices. The downturn on the
Australian stock exchanges merely
echoes similar bumps elsewhere.
Many overseas-owned corporations
anticipated the curb on dollar outflow
and took pains to seek loans or in-
crease capital months before the axe
fell. As reported here last week, the
US dollar drain jumped alarmingly in
the months preceding President John-
son’s demand that all US companies
should trim their individual balance of
payments by 15 to 20 p.c. this year.
Apart from the direct influence on
Australia, a more indirect impact
could come through Japan, which is
an important trading partner of Aus-
tralia. Japan relies heavily on US
capital, as America has poured money
into that country since the war.
America recognised the impact of
the Interest Equalisation Tax on Japan
and made a special dispensation by
exempting the first 100 million dollars
of security loans raised by Japan in
New York. But the flow of dollars
to Japan has been about eight times
this amount in recent years, with most
of it coming from US banks which
were financing US investment in
Japan.
If Japan goes to Europe to seek
alternative sources of loan money, she
will encounter a long queue of borrow-
ers who have been shut out of the US.
Obviously this will have an effect on
Japan’s balance of payments and she
will be looking very closely to see
where she can reduce her own trade
gaps.
At a time when new tariffs are
being mooted to combat Australia’s
own rising flow of imports, the US
move comes at an embarrassing
moment.
Surcharge Slows VW
T>ritain’s 15 p.c. imports surcharge
has made a dent in European
export of cars, notably Volkswagen,
which is the largest exporter of cars
to Britain. The 15 p.c. surcharge drops
to 10 p.c. on April 26, which means
that the buyers are tending to hold off
until then.
Volkswagen has cut its export quota
to Britain by 3000 vehicles to 25,500
this year and has set up a large storage
depot in Ghent to stockpile VWs in

anticipation of a sales rush after April
26. Meanwhile British registrations of
Japan is providing stiff competition
in Australia; the Italian market is sick
(following an economic downturn),
and Frenchmen are not wearing out
their cais as quickly as other Euro-
peans. This is because petrol is still
around 9s a Gallon
Competition in Europe is becoming
fiercer, with General Motors and Ford
giving VW and Daimler-Benz a run
for their money.
In looking to the US for a lift in
sales, Britain is discovering that the
VW is making even greater inroads
by shipping 325,000 VWs to the States
last y £ar -
UK manufacturers therefore do not
expect the small rise in local registra-
tions will offset the export decline.

ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
A Light Touch on the Brakes
Some implications for industrial financing
official directive, increasing bank
fixed interest deposit rate and maxi-
mum bank overdraft rates may have
been issued by Dr Coombs but it looks
to have been prepared or at any rate
■ inspired by Sir Roland Wilson. Maybe
there is a case for stepping up interest
rates as a containment measure along
the lines suggested by Dr. Coombs,
though one would have expected the
seasonal tightening of liquidity to have
sufficiently narrowed the business
world’s scope for overdoing its use of
credit for the next few months with-
out having higher bank overdraft rates
to pay.
Indeed one might well expect the
Reserve Bank to make releases of
Special Reserve Deposits in the next few
months to ease the strain on liquidity.
But, realistically, containment is not
the big problem at the moment. Rather
it is to increase the attractiveness of
Government loans, particularly to short-
term subscribers.
As was pointed out last week in this
column, following the failure of the
last two Federal loans to be fully sub-
scribed a mild crisis has arisen in loan
raising. As we indicated, part of the
trouble in these last two loans has been
the expectation of better terms being
offered in subsequent loans, which has
prompted short-term subscribers to hold
off. Admittedly the terms of the last
loan were more favorable to short-term
subscribers than the previous one, but
the margin of betterment was not con-
sidered wide enough.
So, although there is admittedly a
ceiling above which the authorities
would not want to push the short-term
rate on the next bond issue (it is widely
thought it could be even higher than
the long-term rate), they will certainly
have to make the terms considerably
more attractive than last time. The rise
of i p.c. in bank fixed deposit
rates is a first pointer that this is their
intention and, perhaps before this issue
of The Bulletin is published, we will
have had a further pointer, an increase
in the rate of savings banks deposits.
Indeed such an increase seems even
more strongly warranted by loan raising
requirements than the fixed deposit and
overdraft rates moves.
For, again, as we noted last week,
it is obvious that availability of money
from the savings banks for Common-
wealth bonds has dwindled to the point
where, without a resurgence, the
medium and long tranches of Govern-
ment loans will be struggling as much
as the short has done in recent loans
to fill their targets. Not only that, this
slower movement of funds into savings
banks deposits will also seriously restrict
the flow of money into housing from
this direction, which is one of the big-
gest sources of such funds.
Clearly the authorities are getting in
nice and early in taking this sort of
N. A. JACKSON
action which, as we painfully remember,
was delayed far too long in 1960-1961,
when the balance of payments was
deteriorating much more rapidly than
at present and when we didn’t have
anything like the present reserves to
cushion it. One can only think that the
authorities expect a much swifter run
down in reserves than we have so far
been envisaging and that they believe
these early steps to hold the overseas
fort will not in present circumstances
shake the foundation of full employ-
ment, at any rate to anything like the
same extent as it did in 1961.
The increase in overdraft rates in
itself is a containment measure which,
on an interpretation of the Reserve
Bank statement, is intended, possibly
at some remove, to ease the strain on
the balance of payments. Presumably
a double effect is intended to come
from, first, a dampening of effective
demand which in turn would be trans-
lated into a reduction in the demand
for imports and, second, directly cut-
ting imports by increasing the cost of
financing them.
Admittedly Dr Coombs’ touch on the
brake is a light one and this seems to
confirm impressions from the business
world that the economy is in no mood
to run hot, indeed rather the contrary,
because caution has taken the place of
last year’s high optimism. The most
obvious manifestation of this is the
slump in share prices.
Had the touch been any stronger the
authorities would in my view have been
courting trouble. As I see it, this is
not the precipitate action which a dan-
gerous balance of payments situation
coupled with a feverish state of internal
economic activity might have obliged
them to take.
Even so, in the context of the con-
tinuing constriction of liquidity, the rise
in bank overdraft rates is likely to have
some undesirable effects on the finan-
cial arrangements of a large number of
business and industrial concerns. These
effects would be aggravated if the over-
draft increases, coupled with the tight-
ness of money, engendered a constric-
tion of trade credit, as happened early
in 1961.
In the last two years or more the
generally strong internal finances of
companies or, more strictly speaking,
high cash flows, have lessened their
relative reliance on bank overdraft. The
effect of this is seen in the modest in-
crease in bank advances in this period,
when economic activity has been run-
ning at a remarkably high level. Equally
it is reflected in the fact that new cash
issues for capital by companies have
been comparatively rare in this period.
However, with the slowing down of
profit increases over a wide field of
companies, not least attributable to the
basic wage increase last year, cash
flows have been reduced and the need
for more outside finance, particularly
for working capital, has increased. The
effect of this can be noticed in the re-
vival of the new issues market in recent
weeks and doubtless there have been
an increasing number of company
callers at the banks and the finance
companies.
A good many of these callers have
doubtless finished up at the finance
houses. As Mr N. A. Jackson, the new
general manager of the CBA, told the


recent international banking summer
school in Melbourne, Dr Coombs’ direc-
tives to the banks last October to restrict
new lending have been biting, though
“experience has shown that monetary
restriction applied through the banking
system has tended to be offset as bor-
rowers turn to alternative credit
sources”.'
However, if the outside finance houses
are playing the game as outlined to them
last October, they also will have been
more selective in granting credit these
last few months and they have even
mere reason to be keeping faith with the
Reserve Bank now, when it is obviously
trying to get further restriction. It will
be recalled that last October Dr Coombs
said that “it would be valuable if other
sources besides the banks ensured that
their liquid position was strong and
that the quality of their business was
good.”
As only listed companies have access
to the capital market, obviously those
likely to be placed under the greatest
strain in the emerging circumstances will
be the legions of proprietaries and pri-
vate businesses. Some of these, of
course, have access to overseas funds of
parents and associated companies, but
the majority probably have to go first to
the banks. If their needs cannot be
met there they have no other alternative
but to search the outer fields of finance,
where interest rates are notoriously high,
j n itself a mere quarter p.c. increase
in the maximum bank overdraft rate is of
far less significance to bank borrowers
than the actual availability of bank
finance to them. In this respect the liquid-
ity stringency is likely to bear more
heavily on borrowers than the extra
amount they will have to pay to the
banks on the funds they can get. It
is not as if we had a 7 p.c. Bank Rate
as in Britain and banks were charging
up to 9 p.c. on loans, as they have been
doing these last six months or so.
A s we have seen, the incidence of the
liquidity stringency falls heaviest on
those who are forced away from the
banks and, without new issues in the
capital market to help, have to pay the
high rates of the open market or go
without.

Regional Growth a la Carte
A review of Susan Priestley's “Echuca”
fpHE path of population and industrial
dispersion outside the coastal cities
in Australia has never been easy and it
is liberally studded with examples of
towns and industries which have waxed
and waned. Admittedly most of our
ghost towns have a mining history, but
there are also many where industries of
one sort or other have been tried and
failed to survive. Nor is it just a matter
of towns and industries fading away.
Innumerable promising inland places
have simply stood still or gone back-
wards while the economy in general has
been bursting with growth.
In face of the failures and the obvious
counter-attractions for industrial deve-
lopment in the coastal cities, decentra-
lisers could well have given up the
ghost long ago. Instead, as we know,
they are more vocal than ever and their
cause is worthy nationally speaking.
Regional development themes are all the
rage. Nearly every State is at least
formally active on this front. Plans
proliferate.
NSW has a whole Government depart-
ment bent on the cause, in the north of
Australia the Federal Government and
two States are deeply involved in the
business, while in Victoria there is a
Minister of State Development and two
unofficial bodies, Develop Victoria
Council run by the Victorian Employ-
ers’ Federation and also the Victorian
Promotion Committee at least formally
engaged. At the minimum, then, the
thorny paths away from the coasts are
paved with good intentions.
The pity is that the economic history
of regional development of the interior
is not better documented. In mining it
is a good deal better than for other in-
dustry and, as at Cobar for instance,
the geological maps and company his-
tories have pointed trackers back. Many
country towns have had their fair share
MISS SUSAN PRIESTLEY
of economic ebbs and flows over periods
of more than a hundred years now. As
guides to their future possibilities for
decentralised industry their recorded
experiences would be invaluable. Good-
ness knows our literature on national
economic growth and fluctuations is full
enough.
It is universally recognised that Aus-
tralia reached the economic take-off point
in the Rostow sense sometime during the
last war. This is a useful concept applied
to countries which have got off the
ground in industrial development, have
managed to stay in flight and in con-
sequence have been able to reach
greater economic heights.
After reading Susan Priestley’s new
book “Echuca”, published by Jacaranda
Press, we may search in vain for an
equivalent term to describe a country
centre where industrialisation had
reached the stage when a growth rate
above the average seemed assured.
It was not that Miss Priestley’s book
suggested such a stage had been reached
by Echuca. Indeed I got a stronger
feeling about Albury on a recent visit,
though not at Swan Hill or Mildura, the
two other main Murray Valley centres,
some months ago. All four places are
still on the ground and the two furthest
down stream seemed more content to
be there than the other two whose
wings are flapping madly on decentrali-
sation fuel without lifting them aloft.
You don't have to search far in Aus-
tralian economics literature for reasons
why so many aspiring inland centres
have failed to achieve the necessary de-
gree of industrial developments to get
economically airborne. But new angles
are always refreshing and of value for
the future of the decentralising process.
“Echuca” doesn’t set out to read us any
lessons. It was written simply to tell
the borough's tale. It does this in
chronological order from the time before
1840 when Aborigines were in sole pos-
session to the present day when, out of
a population of less than 7000, about
800 are employed in one industrial en-
terprise, the Swedish-owned SKF ball
bearings firm. Even the latter has not
brought Echuca to the take-off point, as
it stands in splendid isolation in what is
mainly a service town for a rich rural
surround.
Yet Miss Priestley has achieved a
major success as a contributor to decen-
tralisation literature and should be read
by all those still nursing illusions about
that painful process. It is not that she
shows the way to or offers any solutions
• —simply that her story illumines the
difficulties. It is an essay in frustrated
growth.
It comes out very strongly in this
book that Echuca’s stultified growth de-
rived not from any lack of enterprise or

staying power on the part of the popu-
lace but rather from the various changes
of economic winds. For instance, high
hopes of canalising the bulk of the
Riverina’s trade through the place were
frustrated despite Echuca becoming the
first railhead on the Murray when the
line from Melbourne was completed in
1864, fourteen years ahead of the next
Murray town, Wodonga, to get one
(1878). A big two-way trade in cattle
from NSW and Queensland to supply
meat for the goldfields and Melbourne
with provisions for stations and farms
on either side of the border and along
the Murray put Echuca in line to be-
come a big entrepot.
But it didn’t work out that way. The
spread of rail and road communica-
tions from Sydney diverted a good deal
of the potential Riverina trade towards
the NSW capital, most station owners
ordered their provisions in bulk from the
capitals, and customs duties played un-
kind tricks for which all sorts of im-
provised solutions failed to provide
solace for Echuca.
Similarly, when a bit later meat pre-
serving was tried and good export
markets gained, the advent of refrigera-
tion ultimately knocked it on the head.
Equally with timber. The railway and
wharf building boom in Victoria, NSW
and SA in the ’7os and ’Bos provided a
thriving market for local redgum and
was the main impetus behind Echuca’s
population rising sharply in the ’7os.
Timber blocks for Melbourne streets and
building planks were other outlets. Up-
wards of 1500 were employed in the
industry in 1877. But the Victorian
Government became concerned about
conserving supplies and put on an ex-
port tax which cut the industry in half.
Markets were practically restricted to
the Victorian Railways and the Mel-
bourne Harbour Trust. Echuca’s tim-
ber industry has never been the same
again and now employs only a small
fraction of its working population.
It was the same with the once thriving
river trade, whose swansong was sung
in tune with the proliferation of~ rail-
ways linking upstream ports with Mel-
bourne and Sydney. It reached a peak
in 1881, when Echuca handled 35,577
tons of shipping. Yet by the end of the
century most of the boats and the busi-
ness and men around them had vanish-
ed.
All these do not add up to a success
story in decentralisation, though in re-
cent years there has been a thickening
in industrialisation in several directions.
This has helped to boost the population,
albeit to about 6500 or not much more
than 2000 higher than it was in 1880.
Most of these new industries are small,
for instance a dry cleaning and dyeing
works, two manufacturers of women’s
wear, a plaster sheet factory, a foundry
and a freezing works together with
numerous agricultural machinery and
automotive servicing concerns. However,
one of the new industries, the SKF ball-
bearing factory, employing some 800 in
a former small-arms factory built by the
Government during the war, is a signifi-
cant breakthrough in decentralisation and
could point the way to better things.
It is a pity Miss Priestley doesn't go a
bit deeper into the modern economic
setting, but when she took on the task
of writing up the history of Echuca she
probably didn’t start out with the in-
tention of concentrating on its economic
aspects. She has in fact given us a good
helping of economics and would be in
her rights to complain if it was said
that this was all she had done.
In fact her main excursion turns out
to be an economic one, though it had
better be said that her “Echuca” rangds
over a much broader field and that the
reader will get an intimate feeling of
growing up with the place on all its
various fronts. Pioneers as well as in-
dustries come alive and if some of
these fade out rather abruptly after
winning one's interest, fresh ones keep
coming on to take their place.


The Unfortified Conquest
Australian table wines capture a market
A ustralia’s wine-makers are looking
forward to an ever-increasing de-
mand for their products, both at home
and abroad. As far as local production
is concerned, the current vintage looks
like being a record one in most areas.
On the export side of the picture there
has been a slight decline—from 1.7 mil-
lion gallons in 1958 to 1.5 million gal-
lons last year —but latest efforts to
establish Australian wine on foreign
markets seem to be having encouraging
results.
There has always been a steady de-
mand within Australia for fortified wines
(sherry, port and the like). It is only
in recent years that table wines have
begun to assume a more important posi-
tion in our wine tastes. Figures from
the Federal Wine and Brandy Producers’
Council show that in the last five years
wholesale sales of fortified wines (in-
cluding cocktail and vermouth types)
have risen only slightly.
In 1959-60 8,777,000 gallons were
sold, but by 1963-64 the gallonage had
risen only to 8,828,000. Table wines,
on the other hand, have risen in sales
from 2,970,000 gallons to 4,392,000
gallons, or nearly 49 p.c. Accordingly,
table wines’ share of the total market
has risen from 25.3 p.c. in 1959-60 to
33.3 p.c. in 1963-64.
One wine company estimated the
breakdown of Australian wine consump-
tion as follows: table and sparkling
wines, 33.3 p.c.; sweet sherry, 40 p.c.;
dry sherry, 15 p.c.; port, muscat, etc.,
11.6 p.c. In terms of table wines, more
reds are sold than whites. “However,
whites are catching up fast,” this com-
pany said.
Several factors have combined to give
the whole wine market a spurt ahead.
A more affluent society, higher stand-
ards of living, a measure of Continental
influence introduced by migrants are a
few. Possibly one of the greatest stimu-
lants has come from the industry itself,
which has been conducting an intensive
advertising campaign over the last few
years.
The cheaper sparkling wines such as
Porphyry Pearl, Barossa Pearl, Chateau
Gay and the introduction of flagons or
decanters have also pushed wine sales
ahead.
There are wine-producing areas in
nearly every State, the largest being in
South Australia, the smallest in Queens-
land.
Mr H. McCarter, acting manager for
B. Seppelt and Sons, described the wine
business at present as “buoyant”. “In
fact the word energetic would probably
be more appropriate. The industry is
getting to be an important part of the
economy.” The Seppelt company is
based in Adelaide. It produces a com-
plete range of wines. One of its best-
known brands is Great Western Cham-
pagne.
“The growth rate at the moment /is
rapid, though I would not say we are on
the threshold of a boom,” Mr McCarter
said. “Growth is steady, although being
rapid at the same time. The growing
acceptance of wines in Australia can
be attributed to many things. We all
have knowledge of most of them, one
of the popular ones being the influx of
European migrants. However, I do feel
that even more important has been the
education of the public to wine by the
various associations who are engaged
continuously in a promotion of some
description.”
Most of the companies The Bulletin
interviewed are putting a lot of effort
into exports. “Our company is doing
quite a lot of business in the Pacific
islands areas and in the East with coun-
tries like Japan,” Mr McCarter said.
The wine that is shipped out is exactly
the same as that for domestic consump-
tion, but at special export prices which
are considerably lower than those at
home.
A feature of the industry is that while
the larger wine-producing companies
have their own vineyards, they still buy
most of their grapes from local vigne-
rons. Penfolds Wines Australia Ltd, for
instance, has nearly 1700 acres under
vines in South Australia and NSW, yet
these supply only about two-fifths of
the company’s requirements. Chief
executive Mr J. Penfold Hyland said
that, because of the cost of establishing
a winery in a grape-growing area, nearly
all major companies bought either the
grape or the wine from growers in those
areas. For instance, we don’t have
vineyards in the MIA, so we buy from
the returned soldiers there. And when
we find that our own vineyards are not
capable of producing enough of a par-
ticular type of wine we buy outside.”
Mr Hyland said he was concerned
about conditions of quarantine in Aus-
tralia and the effect they had on im-
ported cuttings. “Because of the danger
of phylloxera entering the country, cut-
tings must stay three years in a quaran-
tine station. We have lost quite a few
valuable cuttings in recent years because
conditions have not been ideal for the
vines to live.
“I would like to see a quarantine sta-
tion in a more viticulturally suitable
area, run by the wine industry but under
Government supervision, of course. The
vines need a better chance of survival
and the more we can get into Australia
and keep alive, the more chance we have
of expanding the scope of our produc-
tion and the quality of our wines. This
too would improve our export image.
“With the help of the agricultural
departments the industry is doing soil
tests, checks of sun hours during the
ripening period, frost research and so
on. Consequently the quality of grapes
and wines is being improved all the
time.”
Mr Hyland said he did not believe
vineyards would be established in areas
other than where they are now. “The
major reason for this is the placement

LIMITED
AUDITED PROFIT RESULT FOR HALF-YEAR ENDED 31st JANUARY, 1965
The Consolidated Net Profit of the Group for the
half-year, after providing for taxation, as revealed
by audited accounts is £716,542 compared with
£773,692 last year, a reduction of 7.4%. This profit
represents an earning rate of 20.5% per annum on
the Ordinary Capital, which compares with 22.2%
per annum for the same period last year after taxa-
tion adjustment.
This result was achieved after depreciation of
£116,697, and taxation of £484,852, compared with
£97,187 and £534,862, last year respectively.
The taxation for the half-year ended January,
1964, has been adjusted to the rate of taxation paid
of 8/6d. in the £ from the rate of 8/- provided at
that date.
REPORT ON RESULTS
The Directors consider the profit result to be
satisfactory having regard to the very heavy expense
involved in the launching of Waltons in Victoria.
This launching, embracing eleven stores including
the new Bourke Street city department store and
two suburban department stores, took place approxi-
mately mid-way through the half-year on 22nd
October, 1964. It is the biggest. single project yet
undertaken by the Company.
A substantial price is being paid to establish
Waltons in the Victorian market, but the potential
future profits fully justify the price. The Victorian
market is comparable with the New South Wales
market and its potential for this Company is indi-
cated by the profit being earned by the Company in
New South Wales.
From the similar launching as Waltons in New
South Wales in November, 1953, the profits of this
Company in this State have grown to the point
where for the past two years they have been ex-
ceeded in the field o£ general retailing in New South
Wales by only one otiier company, and that company
commenced business in the city of Sydney more than
125 years ago.
In the half-year under review the profit earned in
New South Wales before taxation was £1,015,426 —•
an increase of 15.03% over the corresponding period
of the previous year. This profit has increased more
than 2£ times in the past five years, £378,721, being
the profit made in New South Wales for the half-
year to 31st January, 1960. The Directors see no
reason why the full implementation of the Com-
pany’s merchandising methods and skills should not
bring comparable results in Victoria within a reason-
able period.
The increase in profit in New South Wales for the
half-year was obtained from the same number of
stores as in the previous year.
In Queensland these same methods produce pro-
fits fully comparable with those of New South Wales
having regard to the smaller market and the portion
of it in which the Company is established.
The acceptance of the Company’s merchandising
methods in Victoria is indicated by the sales of the
Bourke Street department store which immediately
established a rate in excess of the sales figures of
either the department store in the Sydney suburb of
Bankstown or the Park Street department store in
the city of Sydney, which until then were respec-
tively first and second in sales volume in the chain.
Bourke Street moved further ahead in January and
February.
It is interesting to note that in the half-year pro-
fits of the Bankstown department store were 33.3%
higher, and the Park. Street department store 22.1%
higher than the profits of the same half of the pre-
vious year.
The other stores in Melbourne now operating as
Waltons also show substantial increases in sales
and already most are obtaining sales comparable
with similar-sized stores in the group in Sydney.
Apart from the development in Victoria already
referred to, there has been nothing abnormal in the
half-year’s operations. Rigid credit control has been
maintained and more than adequate provision made
for bad and doubtful debts before arriving at the
profit for the half-year.
INTERIM DIVIDENDS
Interim half-yearly dividends have been declared
at the rate of 12i per cent per annum on the Ordin-
ary Capital and 10 per cent per annum on the First
Preference Capital of the Company, payable on
Wednesday, 14th April, 1965. Interest on Convertible
Notes for the half-year under review will also be
payable on the same date. Duly completed transfers
received up to 5 p.m., on Friday, 19th March, 1965,
will be registered before dividends and interest
entitlements are determined.
SECOND HALF YEAR
Sales for February, 1965, the first month of the
second half-year, for New South Wales and Queens-
land, show an increase of 13.5% over February last
year. As would be expected, the increase in Victoria
is substantially greater.

of wineries. In the established areas
the grape can be crushed and the wine
made, but the cost of setting other pro-
duction centres up is prohibitive. Be-
cause grapes in bulk don’t travel too
well it is imperative that crushing faci-
lities are available immediately.”
Mr R. H. Kidd, a director of Linde-
man (Holdings) Ltd, said the export of
wine was most necessary to the indus-
try. “Although less than 10 p.c. of our
wine is exported, it is imperative that
we continue to export. If exports were
suddenly stopped, everyone concerned
with wine-making would be seriously
affected.
“For a start there would be a surplus
of wine on the local market and manu-
facturers would have to cut prices or
carry larger stocks. Then the vignerons
would be affected. We grow only a
very small amount of the grapes we use,
so if the industry cannot export and we
cannot sell, the grower would go out of
business. While we can turn to other
activities to earn, the grower cannot —
all he has is grapes.
“Most of Australia’s exported wine
goes to the UK. It is not so much ex-
ported by Australian companies as im-
ported by English companies—Emu, for
instance—who import our wines in bulk
and blend and bottle them in England.
Exports of Australian branded wines are
very small. We export more Austra-
lian brands to Canada than we do to
the UK.”
There are conflicting opinions in the
industry on the quality of irrigated
grapes compared with non-irrigated. Mr
Hyland said he could see no reason why
irrigated grapes should be of any lesser
quality than the other type. “If the
irrigation is done scientifically and at
the right time there is no reason for
any difference.”
Mr Kidd, on the other hand, said
irrigated vineyards returned a greater
yield per acre (with consequently lower
production costs) than those that were
non-irrigated. “Low yields from a
vineyard return higher quality. The
Hunter Valley area, for example, which
is not irrigated, produces some of the
finest quality wines in Australia.”
This is not to say, of course, that wine
from irrigated areas is of poor quality.
There is a wealth of argument from
wine experts which seems to support the
theory that irrigated grapes are of lesser
quality. However, they are used to pro-
duce the popular wines and are used for
blending, while the more special grape
is used for the more expensive, vintage
wine.
One wine authority felt we should pay
more attention to the East for the sale
of exported wines. “The major problem
we face in exporting to the UK is dis-
tance. Wine travels reasonably well in
bulk but so much better in bottles. But
the freight on bottles is enormous. The
English buyer has to purchase our wine
at almost the same price as he can pur-
chase a French wine, even taking into
account the preferential tariff our wine
carries.
“The cost of freight is against us.
It is almost the reverse of the trouble
imported wines have in Australia. They,
too, have to face high freight charges
because they’re all bottled, and on top
of that there is a high protective tariff.
The imported wines don’t worry us
—they act as „a stimulant to the local
market. People find that after paying
17s. 6d. for a poor quality imported
wine they can pay 10s. or 12s. and buy
an excellent quality local wine.
“Another problem with export is our
volume of production. We can make
wines equal to the very best French or
Rhine wines, though only in quan-
tities. Consequently they are kept for
the local market and snapped up very
quickly. We make a great number of
average quality wines, yet again not very
much is available for export because of
the home market. They are better than
the same strata of European wines, but
difficult to promote because they are
not as well known and anyway the
better known French and German wines
sell for roughly the same price. On
the European market we also have the
problems of nomenclature. For instance,
we cannot sell our wines in Europe as
being claret, sherry, port and moselle,
so we have to use names such as Aus-
tralian dry red, Australian ruby and so
on.”
A director of Orlando Wines, Mr K.
Gramp, forecast export difficulties for
Australian wines. “We export to most
countries,” he said. “The UK, New
Zealand, Canada, Japan and the West
Indies are our most important customers.
The future for exporting looks like one
of steady expansion although there could
be a couple of problems. If the UK joins
the Common Market we will have to
look for new customers. Also I under-
stand that Japanese producers are on
the verge of lobbying for a protective
tariff on imported wines. This would cut
back the very good potential offered by
the Japanese.”
Mr Gramp said the industry would
progress steadily over the next few years,
especially in the table wine field. Barossa
Pearl is the group’s best selling line. The
company is also one of the most im-
portant exporters, around 10 p.c. of its
turnover being accounted for by overseas
sales.
Mr F. Devine, Victorian manager of
S. Wynn and Co., the company at the
head of the Wynvale Wines group, said
despite big increases in turnovers in the
wine industry, it was one of low return
on investment owing to the high degree
of capitalisation. This fact was pointed
out by most companies The Bulletin
spoke to. “Consumption is increasing at
only a very minor rate per head of popu-
lation,” Mr Devine said.
“The increase caused by and still to
come from actual population increases
in Australia is much more important.
This is lifting our total gallonage. The
greatest growth potential lies in the un-
fortified wines,” he added.


Sharing in Iran’s Development
Australian merchants should show livelier interest
From RONALD ANDERSON in Teheran
of the under-developed nations of
Asia, Africa and the Middle East
have a better basis on which to build
a prosperous future than Iran, the old
Persia. Sprawled across the trade routes
linking Europe and the Mediterranean
with Asia, Iran is the world’s fourth-
largest oil producer and has a compara-
tively small population of 20 million
scattered across a huge country. With
oil revenues rising each year and un-
hindered by population pressures or a
shortage of arable land, Iran is rapidly
throwing off feudalism and converting
to a modern semi-industrial economy.
The capital, Teheran, at the foot of the
snow - capped Elburz Mountains, is a
booming modern city of more than
two million. But even more surprising is
the radical change wrought in a few
years in some of the smaller cities and
towns—a transformation from dusty
run-down Middle Eastern villages to
bright, prosperous-looking modern towns.
As it modernises and industrialises, Iran
is becoming an inviting market for the
world.
Iran already imports £A2BO million
worth of goods from 85 nations round
the world each year. Yet, thanks to oil
revenues totalling £335 million out of
total exports of £393 million, she re-
tains a favorable balance of trade.
The standard of living in Iran is rising
rapidly, even if not as rapidly as reform-
minded Emperor Mohammad Reza Shah
would wish. Already, though, Iranian
planners are talking ambitiously of
matching Western Europe per capita in-
come levels within 25 years. This may
be optimistic, but there is no doubt that
Iran’s swiftly-moving economy will
offer increasing opportunities for foreign
merchants in the next decade. Ulti-
mately, as industries and agriculture
develop, Iran will adopt protectionist
policies to guard them against imports.
By then, however, it will be in the mar-
ket for a whole new range of more
sophisticated and luxury products.
It should not be imagined that Iran
is an Afghanistan or a Nepal. Unlike
these countries, but like its eastern
neighbors India and Pakistan, Iran's
largely illiterate peasant population does
not prohibit the existence of a substan-
tial educated, wealthy and cultured class.
Unlike India and Pakistan this class in
Iran can usually afford to indulge its
whims—in cars, houses and luxury
goods of all kinds. Thus it is strange
that Australian businessmen have not
taken advantage of our unfavorable
trade balance with Iran to win a larger
share of this expanding and potentially
important market.
" At present Australia is Iran’s fifth
best customer, buying petroleum pro-
ducts. and to a lesser extent dates and
hand-woven carpets worth £2l million
a year. But on the list of countries
exporting to Iran we rate only nine-
teenth, with goods worth a mere £2 mil-
lion a year, behind even Nationalist
China and tiny Kuwait. Thus we buy
II times as much from Iran as does the
United States and three times as much as
the Soviet Union, though our exports to
Iran are only 4 p.c. of the US’s and a
quarter of the USSR's.
With improved shipping between
Australia and Persian Gulf ports, the
main entry point for Iranian imports,
this share of Iran's market appears too
low. What is more, there is a very real
danger that our sales will decline in the
next few years unless Australian mer-
chants take a livelier interest.
At the moment wheat runs wool a
close second as our major export to
Iran. Between them the two products
account for 86 p.c. of our sales. Al-
though we are Iran’s second biggest
supplier of wheat, we are swamped by
the five times larger quantity supplied
by the United States, largely under
Public Law 480.
Tran was formerly basically self-suffi-
cient in foodstuffs. In recent years
food grain production has not kept pace
with rising consumption. The Govern-
ment is now stressing the need to avoid
dependence on wheat imports and it is
probable that self-sufficiency will be
achieved within the next few years.
Fortunately the outlook for our wool
sales is better. We already supply 85
p.c. of Iran’s imports of both raw and
scoured wool and about 25 p.c. of
combed wool. In combed wool our
sales are second to those of Japan and
narrowly ahead of the United Kingdom.
As Iran is now in the process of deve-
loping a small, modern, wool-textile in-
dustry, it is probable that her imports of
wool fabrics—now worth £6 million a
year and dominated by the UK —will
tend to fall and her imports of raw and
scoured wool rise. In this case Aus-
tralia will benefit, as Iranians show a
marked preference for fine Australian
merino wools. Iranian wool, which is
used locally and exported, is coarse and
almost all of carpet quality.
Australia does not participate in the
£2 million-a-year trade in woollen thread
and yarn, nor in the £li million demand
for grease and animal fats.
In other categories of agricultural
products Australia’s sales to Iran are
often unaccountably small. In butter,
for example, we are among the top six
supplying nations, yet account for less
than 1 p.c. of total imports, losing out
to the big three, Denmark, Poland and
the Netherlands, and even to the UK
and tiny Lebanon. Iranian supermarkets
are full of Danish, French and Dutch
butter, but I have not seen a pound of
the Australian product. We supply
about 4 p.c. of Iran’s cheese purchases,
again being heavily outsold by Den-
mark, Britain, Italy and even little
Lebanon. Iran gets about a fifth of her
ghee from us, but the trade is too small
to be significant.
We do not figure in Iran’s egg im-
ports, although the trade is becoming
substantial. At present- Israel has nearly
all the market, with Nationalist China in
second place. It would probably be a
hard market to break into.
Iran buys £H million worth of flour
each year. Australia’s share is
valued at £300! Biggest suppliers are
old rivals West Germany, France and
Italy, followed by the US and Belgium.
Our sales are really dismal in this field.
The figures show that we are outsold
ten times by Pakistan, herself an im-
porter of wheat, and from fifty to two
hundred times by some of the tiny Per-
sian Gulf sheikdoms such as Oman,
Katar and Mokella. To add insult to
injury, many of these countries received
payment at twice the rate we did.
We did not sell any sugar to Iran,
although this trade is worth almost
£2O million a year. At present it is
divided among Turkey, Nationalist
China, Kuwait, USSR, Cuba and Bel-
gium. Iran is expanding her own pro-
duction of both beet and cane sugar,
though it will be some years before she
supplies even half her expanding re-
quirements. We supply about a third of
Iran's imports of frozen meat, but Den-
mark, which supplies only two-thirds the
quantity of meat, gets paid three times
as much! Iran is short of meat and has
recently been trucking huge numbers of
sheep in from both Turkey and
Afghanistan for slaughter. We should
be able to compete at least as well as
the US on this market.
Powdered milk is a £1 million a year
business, split among 16 countries and
not including Australia. We get about
£lOO worth of business as the fifth
largest supplier (with less than 1 p.c.

of the market) in a small tinned fruit
trade dominated by the US.
In industrial goods many categories
tend to be dominated by European
countries. This is especially in the
£9 million rod, beam and angle iron and
steel field, which is monopolised by West
Germany Belgium. We manage
£lOOO worth out of a £l4 million im-
port trade in iron and steel wire, do not
supply sheet iron and steel (£2m.), zinc
or lead coated (£ 1 k million, topped by
Japan), tinplate (£lm., USA), or tubes
and piping (£6m.). In all these cate-
gories the field is wide open, with dozens
of countries competing. We should be
able to win a small share of the market
—if Australian firms are interested and
can compete on a price basis.
Iran imports millions of pounds worth
of assorted tools and implements from
just about every country on her import
list—except Australia. Imports of sheet
copper run into millions, too, but our
share is about £3OOO. We manage to
sell a few cigarette lighters, but no
boilers or steam engines and only a
single car engine worth less than £lOO
(and this in a £2 million trade). Twenty-
four countries share a £3 million trade
in pumps, but Australia is again un-
represented.
Iran is rapidly mechanising its agri-
culture, especially in the go-ahead Tur-
koman country of the north. Its annual
purchases of agricultural machinery
approach £l5 million. Our share is
£2500. Tractors, not included in this
figure, account for £4 million a year and
here we manage to sell units worth
£90,000. We do not, however, sell any
harvesters (worth £li million alone),
ploughs, fertiliser spreaders, seeders,
harrows.
Cars are a £5 million import business.
In the last year for which figures are
available our share was nil. Neverthe-
less, at least one late-model Holden is
to be seen on the streets of Teheran. The
trade in trucks and buses, worth £6 mil-
lion a year, is dominated by USA, West
Germany and the UK; the car imports
by USA and Germany.
Undoubtedly there have been several
very good reasons why Australian firms
have not taken a greater interest in Iran,
shipping difficulties being an obvious
one. Yet today many of the countries
outselling us in fields in which we ex-
port are subject to even greater geo-
graphical disadvantages. Iranian busi-
nessmen and importers tell me again
and again that they have never seen an
Australian salesman. Iran is becoming
such a competitive market that second-
hand contacts are virtually useless. In
some fields in which Australia would
be interested Iran’s foreign needs are
still small. If the Iranian market de-
velops as expected, firms which establish
a foothold now could benefit in the
years ahead.

Savoy as a Catalyst'
CAGA moves on Aust. Equity
TSThen Commercial and General Ac-
” ceptance acquired an almost half-
interest in the Australian Equity Cor-
poration (called Motor Credits until
diversification outmoded the name) in
December, 1963, it was stated by those
who should know that the arrangement
would prove beneficial to both finance
companies. CAGA has undoubtedly
managed to get the best side of the wish-
bone, while it is painfully obvious that
AEC’s acquisition of the hallowed bank-
backing (Commercial Banking Co. of
Sydney owns 40 p.c. of CAGA) and the
ability to borrow money more cheaply
have done nothing at all to help it along,
from the shareholders’ point of view.
In fact, it has gone rather severely
downhill in the last 14 months, thanks
mainly to the capital increases made
when CAGA stepped in and what looks
like being an unwise loan to Savoy Cor-
poration. CAGA has wasted no time in
snapping up its opportunity to buy what
remains of the company’s shares on the
cheap. A weak share market, the recent
announcement that interim dividend will
be cut from 5 p.c. to 3 p.c. and the
news that Savoy is under a receiver
while its books still carry a debt of over
£2 million to AEC all helped push the
shares below par to 4s. 6d.
Under these circumstances, the 6s.
offered for the 51.5 p.c. of shares held
publicly cannot help but look extremely
attractive. It will cost £1,050,600 and,
although shareholders must realise that
the price is low in relation to past per-
formances and those which lie in poten-
tial once the Savoy mess is cleaned up,
they will undoubtedly accept. Cash in
hand is hard to refuse, especially when
it raises the opportunity Of recovering
that already lost.
Knowing that CAGA has struck such
a bargain, shareholders may even see
merit in its shares. Particularly as the
original holding was bought for a song,
too. Around 1.4 million units were
bought from the Victorian Automobile
Chamber of Commerce Insurance '£o.
for an undisclosed price, but the other
1.8 million allotted by AEC cost only
6s. 6d. each. At the time the shares
were fetching around 9s. on the market.
So, for an average price of probably
about 75., CAGA now has full control
of a "company with great potential in
the future. AEC shares were selling
for 12s. when all was fine and rosy.
It is also a safe bet that, with an even
closer alliance with the Ijank, a mistake
such as the Savoy one will be unlikely
to occur. One stockbroker The
Bulletin spoke to went so far as to
suggest the CAGA move was prompted
by the fact that with Savoy in receiver-
ship, AEC \vas also in danger of fold-
ing up if it could not recover its debt.
This may be taking assumption too far,
but it does seem evident that there was
a definite element of self-protection in
the CAGA move. After all, it laid out
more than £2 million to acquire its ini-
tial interest in 1963, so another £1 mil-
lion could not hurt if it will keep the
company out of trouble, especially as
Mr Korman has just coughed up a
similar amount to CAGA ahead of his
time.
Putting aside this speculation, it is on
the cards that CAGA would have made
a takeover move some time in the future

and that AEC’s troubles acted as a cata-
lyst. Only last month, it paid more than
£1 million cash for the AEC outstand-
ings in South Australia. Directors said
the sale was made “for purposes of
economy and with a view to further
consolidating the company’s activities in
the eastern States”. Consolidation has
obviously gone further than expected.
Bigger Sister
/Ance again comes the cry for figures
to accompany interim reports. This
time it’s from those interested in Big
Sister Foods Ltd, canner and processor.
Would directors please note: to say pro-
fit is “comparable” with the previous
corresponding period is not sufficient.
At a time like this, when the market is
all over the place, investors are hungrier
than ever for actual figures on which
to base comparisons.
There is no real quibble with Big
Sister. The “brothers” who were able
to buy the company’s shares at flotation
have seen them rise to their present
price of 355., so there is no real
cause for complaint. But perhaps if the
more highly respected companies
divulged their half-year profits others
would follow.
Instead directors just inform the pub-
lic that group profit was “comparable”
with that earned 12 months ago. This
was despite extensive alterations to the
Balmain (Sydney) factory, which were
completed during the half-year to
December. Directors add that the com-
pany continues to expand in the current
half-year. A large area of industrial
land has been purchased and the first
stage of a new factory is scheduled for
operation before the end of 1965.

Loan is expecting a rise in average
wool prices during this last half of

group’s profit and turnover for the half-
year, but the decrease should be made
good by balance date according to the

up in most of the companies connected
with the industry. Henry B. Smith, the
Victorian-based merchant, scourer and

turnover according to a recent report
on the December period.
It will be interesting to keep an eye
on the relationship between the various
half-yearly performances and each com-
pany's opinion of the market. Dalgety
suffered only a minor setback and re-
garded the future wool market with opti-
mism following slight easings up to
December. However, H. B. Smith’s
“lower” profit was accompanied by
“erratic tendencies” in the wool market,
which was described as being stricken
with “instability”. Rather than con-
fusing investors, the wide discrepancy
between these two descriptions could
be somewhat illuminating.

The Broken Hill Proprietary Company
Limited
EXCERPTS FROM DIRECTORS' SUPPLEMENTARY REPORT—FEBRUARY, 1965
The Directors have pleasure in submitting to shareholders this Supple-
mentary Report covering the period since the Annual General Meeting on
18th September, 1964.
PRODUCTION
Apart from some interruptions caused
by industrial action, the Company’s plants
have continued to operate to capacity. As
the result of new and improved facilities
corqing into operation output has shown
a further sharp increase. Comparing the
half-year ended 30th November last with
the previous half year, pig iron production
increased by 8.4%, insot steel production
by 8 .3% and outputs of blooms and slabs
by 7.3%. These tonnages resulted in record
production of most forms of finished steel.
A notable milestone in the history of
the organisation was passed in the 1964
calendar year when for the first time com-
bined ingot production exceeded 5 million
tons in a period of 12 months.
DEMAND
Despite the very substantial increase in
production we have been unable to satisfy
all Australian requirements which have
been at a higher level than at any other
period in the Company's history. As a
result importations of some steel products
have been taking place and although we
have continued to maintain some supplies
to established export markets the tonnages
have been relatively small.
Vigorous efforts are being made to meet
the shortfall by further increasing our pro-
ductive capacity. Because at this juncture
our finishing capacity is in some directions
in excess of our primary capacity, we are
as a short term measure importing a
limited quantity of semi-finished steel in
order to alleviate the situation.
Our subsidiary companies have experi-
enced similar buoyant market conditions
and their plants continue to operate at
high levels.
COSTS AND PRICES
Since the previous general increase in
steel prices five years ago there have been
substantial rises in the costs of labour,
materials and services used by the Com-
pany. To a considerable extent the ad-
verse effect of these increases on our net
profit has been offset by improved technical
efficiency, by the adoption of new processes
and by the overall effect of high produc-
tion rates. Despite these offsetting factors
some increase in prices was unavoidable
and was applied to most products in
January. Increases in tinplate prices which
are to take place from Ist March, 1965,
were announced earlier. The January in-
crease in prices averaged 2%. A modest
but somewhat higher average price increase
had to be applied by our wire making
subsidiaries.
DEVELOPMENT AND
CONSTRUCTION
Our construction and development pro-
gramme is continuing at a high level. Dur-
ing the year ended 31st May, 1964, the
Company and its subsidiaries spent nearly
£43 million on capital account. During
the half-year ended 30th November, 1964,
group expenditure is estimated as being at
the rate of £5O million per annum.
RAW MATERIALS AND
EXPLORATION
Agreement has been reached with the
Western Australian Government as to the
terms on which the Company will secure
titles to the iron ore deposits in the Deep-
dale area now held under temporary re-
serves. The agreement is subject to en-
gineering and metallurgical problems being
satisfactorily resolved by the Company and
a period of up to 2 years has been allowed
for this. The development of these signifi-
cant deposits will involve the Company in
the provision of railroad and deepwater
port facilities as well as the quarry and
requisite townships. Engineering studies
are proceeding to determine the port
location. The Company has also under-
taken to increase the capacity for iron and
steel making at Kwinana beyond that re-
quired by the 1960 Agreement and to
install in the State capacity for secondary
processing of iron ore (such as the manu-
facture of pellets or sinter). By 1985 the
aggregate of capacity installed in Western
Australia for iron, steel and secondary pro-
cessed ore is to be not less than 3 million
tons per annum. For this purpose second-
ary processed material (such as pellets and
sinter), pig iron and finished steel may be
added together."
There is one aspect of this agreement to
which we would like to draw the particular
attention of shareholders. Prior to the
negotiations which led up to the agreement,
there were two legal barriers to the export
by our Company of iron ore from Western
Australia. One was the embargo by the
Commonwealth Government which was first
imposed in 1938; the other lay in the
terms of the agreements which already
existed between our Company and the
State of Western Australia. The Common-
wealth embargo was imposed at a time
when it was believed that Australia’s re-
sources of high grade iron ore were no
more than adequate for local requirements.
The requirement of the State that iron ore
export should be prevented or restricted
arose from the State’s desire that it should
retain enough high grade ore to ensure
ample resources for the production of steel
in Western Australia.
The attitude of the Commonwealth and
State Governments was based, on and justi-
fied by the then existing knowledge re-
garding iron ore resources in Australia and
Western Australia respectively. The dis-
covery and proving of the iron ore deposits
in the Pilbara and adjacent areas of Western
Australia during the last several years com-
pletely transformed the picture. By the time
we were negotiating the 1964 agreement
it was abundantly clear that the high grade
iron resources in Western Australia were
adequate to permit large scale exports with-
out imperilling the necessary reserves for
Australia’s own steel requirements.
Accordingly in the course of negotiations
with the Western Australian Government it
was suggested that the State should remove
its export ban on Yampi Sound iron ore to
the extent of a tonnage of 11 million tons
per annum. The State was willing to agree
to this course on condition that any exports
by us were postponed until other producers
of Western Australian iron ore had re-
ceived large export contracts or until we
should have started wcirk at Deepdale. We
accepted this condition but before the
agreement was completed the State felt
that it should first ascertain the views of
the. Commonwealth Government. To our
surprise the Commonwealth expressed its
disapproval of the relevant clause on the
ground that the existence of the clause
would imply that the Commonwealth
would allow our Company to export from
Yampi Sound and that it would be unfair
to other iron ore producers if this right was
given. In the result the State felt obliged
to follow the expressed wishes of the Com-
monwealth and the agreement with the
State as it now stands prevents us from
exporting iron ore from Yampi Sound until


Deepdale is ready for production and that
of course must be several years off.
Even when Deepdale is ready for pro-
duction we will still need to obtain Com-
monwealth approval as indeed would have
been the position if the clause as negotiated
had appeared in our final agreement with
the Western Australian Government.
Our interest in iron ore is primarily for
the production of iron and steel in Aus-
tralia and our interest in export is only
secondary. However the Deepdale venture
will be very costly and the ore as mined '
will be of lower quality than the ore we
are now using.
We are concerned at the consequent
effect on future Australian steel prices.
Export of Yampi ore at an early date
would help pay for the development of
Deepdale and therefore would serve to
reduce the impact of capital charges on
the cost of ore from this area.
The first iron ore shipment from Koolan
Island in Yampi Sound was made on
21st January.
The Company’s reserves of coking coal
have been increased by purchase of the
share capital of Pacific Colliery Pty. Ltd.
The holdings of this company adjoin our
Stockton Borehole Colliery on the New-
castle coalfield. Australian Iron & Steel
Pty. Ltd. has purchased the Port Kernbla
No. 2 Colliery, which will be worked as
an extension of Nebo Colliery.
In accordance with the arrangements
previously made Esso Exploration Australia
Inc. commenced its off-shore drilling in the
Gipnsland Basin in December. Though the
work has been somewhat hampered by
weather conditions the first drill hole had
reached a depth of 4,316 feet at the time
of writing this report. Gas has been en-
countered at this depth but its significance
is not yet clear.
Under a similar agreement with the same
company., drilling will take place in the
Bass Basin between Flinders Island and
King Island. \
The Commonwealth Government invited
our Company amongst others to consider
submitting a proposal for the development
of the bauxite deposits at Gove in the
Northern Territory and the Company has
arranged to do so in conjunction with a
subsidiary of the Reynolds Metals Co. of
U.S.A. Proposals by interested parties are
due for lodgment by 15th March.
SHIPBUILDING
The Company has been successful in its
tender for the construction of three 47,000
d.w.t. bulk carriers, the keel of the. first of
which was laid last August. This ship is
scheduled to be commissioned for The
Australian National Line towards the end
of 1966.
Shipyard activities have been restricted
by the present shortage of labour and every
effort is being made to build up the work-
force.
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
Commonwealth Steel Company Ltd.
achieved an increase in sales of more than
15% compared with the corresponding
period of 1963. Additional equipment re-
cently installed at the Waratah plant contri-
buted to substantially increased output.
Although Unanderra output of cold rolled
stainless steel also increased, imports of
this material rose significantly, mainly be-
cause of the ready availability of bright
annealed product from overseas. In order
to meet the swing in demand to this type of
steel for some domestic, commercial and,
particularly, for automotive applications, a
modern vertical bright annealing line is
being installed at Unanderra.
Other features in this Company’s current
£6 million expansion programme include
the modernisation of special steelmaking
capacity, based exclusively on electric arc
furnaces, and, for the first time in Australia,
the application of vacuum degassing, a new
process for production of steel to highest
quality standards.
The Titan Manufacturing Company Pty.
Ltd. has achieved further increases in pro-
duction and sales. The new tungsten car-
bide plant at Newcastle was commissioned
late last year and is operating well. The
nail and barbed wire factory of Titan New
Guinea Pty. Ltd. at Lae commenced
operations in November.
Production by the Australian Wire In-
dustries Pty. Ltd. group of companies was
an all-time record. New wire-drawing and
galvanising plant played a major part in
achieving this result. Further plant ex-
tensions are now in progress. Wire-drawing
facilities are being increased substantially
at Newcastle, Sydney and Geelong. A
wire ropery is in course of construction
at Geelong and two modern wire galvanising
plants, together with field fence machines,
are being installed at Sydney. These ex-
tensions are planned for completion by the
end of 1965.
Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Com-
pany Pty. Ltd. will double its productive
capacity for high carbon ferro manganese
by the installation of a second closed rotat-
ing hearth furnace at Bell Bay. The new
furnace, scheduled for completion in No-
vember, 1966, and the existing furnace,
will process manganese ore from Groote
Eylandt.
Southern Portland Cement Ltd. is enjoy-
ing an increased level of activity, and has
taken the first steps towards a capital
reconstruction.
RESEARCH
Work has continued at the Central Re-
search Laboratories, Shortland, on a variety
of studies, particularly relating to prepara-
tion of raw materials.
SHIPPING
In December, the Company took de-
livery of the 35,400 ton d.w. bulk carrier
“Iron Clipper” to operate on a bare boat
charter for four years carrying iron ore
from Yampi Sound to Port Kernbla. The
need for this vessel, the largest on the
Australian coast, arises from the rapid
increase in raw material and product ship-
ments and the commencement of opera-
tions at Whyalla steel plant and Koolan
Island ore quarry.
LABOUR
Despite all our efforts, the labour posi-
tion remains unsatisfactory, particularly at
Whyalla and Port Kernbla. The Company’s
overseas recruiting work has assisted in
keeping the shortages within tolerable
limits. In the last nine months of 1964,
these activities, mainly in the United King-
dom, resulted in the recruitment of over
800 skilled tradesmen and almost 2,000
unskilled labourers. Close liaison continues
to be maintained with the appropriate
authorities in connection with the engage-
ment of and the provision of accommoda-
tion for these migrants. The Common-
wealth Department of Immigration has
been very helpful and the State Depart-
ments concerned are doing all they can to
assist. Nevertheless, the housing position,
particularly in the Port Kernbla and
Whyalla areas, is difficult.
During the period production was af-
fected by a number of work stoppages,
chiefly at the Newcastle steelworks, which
experienced a good deal of industrial dis-
turbance. Recently, however, labour rela-
tions have been more settled.
In the shipping industry a labour stabilisa-
tion scheme has been instituted by agree-
ment between the Unions, the Shipowners
and the Courts. This scheme is designed
to ensure a constant supply of seamen and
should minimise delays to shipping move-
ments due to crew shortages.
DIVIDENDS
The Board decided to increase the half-
yearly dividend, payable last November, to
10 pence per share". Since 1961, when the
last new share issue was made, the divid-
end rate has steadily increased and the rate
paid in November was 33 5% above the
rate paid in 1961.
NEW SHARE ISSUE
At the Annual General Meeting share-
holders were advised that the Board then
felt that it would need to consider during
1965 or soon afterwards the raising of
further capital by means of a share issue
unless there was some marked change in
circumstances. Nothing has since transpired
to cause the Board to alter the views it
then expressed. v
DIRECTORS
It is with deep regret that your Directors
record the death on 29th January of their
colleague Rear-Admiral C. C. Clark, C. 8.,

voted service to the Company since joining
the Board in 1959.
Mr. C. R. Darvall, General Manager of
the Australia and New Zealand Bank Ltd.,
accepted an invitation to join the Boards
of the Company and its main subsidiaries
and was appointed a Director on 24th
December, 1964.

Last October a one-for-two bonus issue
was made, lifting capital trom £260,000
to £390,000. Soon after, a premium
share placement was made, boosting
ordinary capital by another £60,000.
Preference shares with a face value of

This year s payout will most likely be
10 p . c . Although the interim pay * ent
will b e a steady 5 p.c., indicating that
the 124 p.c. dividend which has pre-
vailed since 1955 could be continued,
the directors did say at the time of the
bonus issue that only 10 p.c. was ex-
pected for the future. Even this rate
would give an effective 15 p.c. on pre-
bonus capital, so shareholders will be
receiving 20 p.c. bigger dividend cheques
in the long run.
Last year's profit equalled 32.7 p.c.
on capital. After such extensive capital
moves, a weaker performance must be
expected in the current year and possibly
1965-66 too. Ordinary dividends will
never even look like being in danger,
nevertheless. The group is climbing
back to the £130,000 profit level of
1959-60, when earning rate was in the
vicinity of 47 p.c. Last year’s result
was the first stage of recovery from the
succession of declines which took profit
down to £30,000 and earning rate to 8.6
p.c. in 1962-63.
Profitable Alliance
A digression from activities other than
hire purchase has helped yet
another financier. Alliance Holdings
Ltd has lifted profit 14 p.c. in the
December half-year to £164,463 and is
maintaining interim dividend at 5 p.c.
In their interim report, directors say
the volume of business rose substantially
in the period under review. As a result
outstandings at December 31 totalled
£28.5 million compared with the previ-
ous corresponding period's figure of
£20.1 million. The second half of the
previous financial year saw outstandings
rise to £24.9 million.
Directors say the latest increase in
outstandings occurred mainly in pro-
perty mortgages, bridging finance and
other secured advances. Hire purchase
outstandings remained steady.
They say the volume of business
available continues at a high level. The
current issue of debentures and notes,
while oversubscribed, will remain open.
(The issue, designed to attract £1 million,
can be oversubscribed by £4 million.)
Metal Money
"Predictions in last week’s interim
A report from O. T. Lempriere of
“substantially higher” results for the cur-
rent year will need to be fulfilled if
earning rates are to be maintained at
around last .year’s recovered 20 p.c.
levels. By the time balance date comes,
paid capital will have jumped from
£644,000 to £817,000, although all of it
will not be dividend ranking until 1965-
66.
The company acts as a metal smelter
and refiner. Late last year it was an-
nounced that the Capper Pass group of
the UK was acquiring a 20 p.c. interest
with the help of a special issue. Now
the interim report has revealed that a
one-for-six par issue will be made to all
shareholders in the near future.


SECURITY ANALYSIS
Some Signs of Over-capitalisation
The structure of Thomas Nationwide Transport
tjT’HE companies which have been dis-
cussed in the three preceding
articles have been established for quite
a long time in the transport industry
(one hesitates today to call them
“common carriers”). Thomas Nation-
wide Transport Ltd, however, is a rela-
tive newcomer, since the business was
started in 1946 by Mr K. W. Thomas
with one truck operating from Sydney.
The present company was formed in
November, 1961, and, following a
placement of 640,000 ss. shares with the
public in December, 1961, the com-
pany became a public listed company
in January, 1962.
The public received these shares at
ss. 9d. plus charges and this figure
would have been reduced by about
a penny by the new issues on a one-
for-ten basis made in September, 1963
and 1964. Today the shares are selling
around 15s. and have been rather
higher. So the original shareholder has
obtained a capital profit of 155 p.c.
despite the fact that the Sydney all
ordinary index has only gained 10 p.c.
Doubtless the good record that the com-
pany has had since listing has had some
effect on this vast improvement over the
index but it does seem that the vendors
of the original business allowed the pub-
lic to obtain their interest on very cheap
terms. A glance at the figures which
were given in the prospectus shows that
the average earning rate of the five years
preceding the placement would have
shown an earnings yield of just over
14 p.c. (!!) on the placement price, while
the forecast dividend of 10 p.c. would,,
have shown a dividend yield of 8.7 p.c.
After making an adjustment for the
bonus content of the rights issue, the
indices of prices and earnings per share
have moved as follows:
1961 1962 1963 1964 1965
SFiare price 100 165 186 322 275
Earnings_ 100 108 109 132 160
The sudden jump from 100 to 165
indicates that the market was fairly
quick to recognise the under-valuation
of the shares when they were issued.
This means that the share price started
from too low a base and any judgments
made on the basis of the market appre-
ciation must take this factor into
account.
Following listing, TNT started a plan
of expansion which seems to have been
aimed towards what might be called
“road-rail” transport. In other words,
TNT set up an organisation to combine
with the railways rather than to compete
with them. There can be no doubt that
this move has been a most successful
one.
In 1962, Scarf's Central Warehousing
was acquired, along with the assets and
goodwill of Scarf’s Expressways and
Rice Cartage: Scarf’s Expressways was
at that time one of the four largest rail
forwarders in Australia. Major addi-
tions were made to the Melbourne and
Adelaide premises during 1961-62 and
a new terminal was built at Devonport.
In the annual report for the 1962-63
year, the directors stated that the rail-
head terminals were now being supple-
mented by the establishment of railhead
distribution centres. This new develop-
ment would allow manufacturers to
arrange with TNT for the distribution
of their products from factory to retail
outlet.
/
In the same report it was stated that
TNT was then the biggest customer of
the railways throughout Australia. From
the figure quoted, £2,250,000, as having
been the company’s national rail ac-
count, it would seem that payment for
rail services could amount to 40 p.c. of
the general operating expenses.
npuE expansion of the company’s dis-
A tribution centres is continuing. In the
1964 annual report it was stated that
warehouses were planned for four
Queensland centres. Expenditure on
warehouses ind terminals of £500,000
was planned for the 1964-65 year. In
furtherance of the Queensland expan-
sion, two cairying companies, one at
Rockhampton and one at Southport,
were acquired during the first six months
of 1964-65. In the half-yearly report
it was announced that a major interest
had been acquired in Power Transport
Group, which had operated a business
very similar to the TNT operation in
Wagga (NSW) for over forty years.
During the 1963-64 year, TNT
moved into the field of refrigerated
transport when it acquired Armstrong
Transport and it may be significant that
Mayne Nickless acquired Metropolitan
Industries not long afterwards. The
four companies which have been dis-
cussed in this series of articles naturally
compete with each other in various
phases of their activities and it can also
be expected that one will concentrate
more on one activity than another.
Brambles, for example, appears to have
made a feature of materials handling and
has a certain amount of diversification
in its interest in Breckett. F. H.
Stephens seems to compete directly with
TNT in “road-rail” transport and has a
modest diversification in a travel agency.
Having indicated some of the points
of difference, I now propose to make
some comparisons between these com-
panies. So far as the share prices and
yields are concerned, the recent pattern
seems to be:
Earn-
Last Div. ings
Company sale Buyer Seller yield yield
Brambles
(ex rights) 16/2 16/3 16/6 4.6% 7.1%
Mayne Nickless 34/6 33/3 34/- 3.6% 6.4%
F. H. Stephens 18/3 17/6 18/6 2.7% 7.8%
TNT 14/11 15/1 3.4% 7.4%
A comparison in absolute terms be-
tween TNT and Stephens is quite inter-
esting in respect of the 1963-64 year.

Stephens’ return on shareholders’
funds is slightly better than TNT with-
out using as much gearing, but it is most
noticeable that TNT’s capital is much
higher than Stephens. The recent issues
have brought the two capitals closer
together, yet TNT’s capital is now
£1,444,000 approximately, which is still
60 p.c. greater than Stephens after its
recent one-for-four issue at par.
It will be very interesting to see how
these two companies develop their capi-
tal structure over the next eighteen
months. On the face of it, Stephens,
with its tighter equity capital and greater
potential for gearing, would seem to
have better prospects than TNT, which
unfortunately seems to have started its
career as a listed public company in an
over-capitalised state from the point of
view of equity capital.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Operating on Thin Ice
Buy VIA for income only
At 3s. 9d. and yielding around 9 p.c.
from the 7 p.c. dividend after
brokerage, the market is reflecting the
uncertain opinions which investors hold
for the future of VIA Ltd's ss. shares.
It is not black enough to write the scrip
off altogether, but it is not bright
enough to warrant prices higher than
about 4s. 3d. At best 1964-65 will only
provide shareholders with a steady divi-
dend and this will probably have a nar-
rower cover than 1963-64.
The company is based in Melbourne,
out at Airport West. It was registered
in 1935, so almost 30 years of operation
have been chalked up. Activities today
are in two divisions —steel and timber.
Steel products range from frames,
doors, lockers and shelving to whole
sheds for all types of storing as well as
accommodation on a mass scale. The
timber division manufactures all types
of partitions, doors, flooring, mouldings
as well as turning out timber for general
use.
Apart from the parent company,
there are two subsidiaries, both opera-
ting timber mills. BHB Timber is
wholly-owned, with a mill at Heyfield.
In December, 1963, a 75 p.c. interest
was acquired in the Newlands Lumber
Co., of Heyfield. Both mills are now
under a joint control, which has im-
proved results so far and should keep
doing so in the current year to Septem-
ber 30.
The success of the co-ordinated tim-
ber companies in 1963-64 was well re-
flected by the fact that group turnover
rose 12 p.c., despite a 17 p.c. drop in
the manufacturing activities of the
parent. Being connected with the build-
ing trade, volume output is essential. In
the lasb half of the year, a major con-
tract was delayed for reasons beyond
the management's control and sales fell v
below budget level. This restricted out-
put, so profit in the final six months was
adversely affected.
The parent should see a recovery in
the current year, barring any further un-
foreseen disturbances. The volume of
orders at balance date was a record and
above budget levels. In addition, a first
export order has recently been received,
valued at £16,000. Directors believe
that this is a forerunner to more over-
seas business.
It seems, therefore, that profits are in
for further gains on an overall basis. If
all goes well, they may regain the buoy-
ant levels of the 1954 to 1957 era. Since
that period they have fallen badly. The
low was in 1960-61 (see table), when a
bumper loss was chalked up. Recovery
has been strong to date.
Add to this the fact that each ss.
share has a net tangible asset backing of
about 7s. 9d., the sound liquid position,
and the statement by directors that the
latest balance sheet does not show head
office freehold at the “appreciably” high
amount at which it has recently been re-
valued, and the future does not lock all
that bad. The inclusion of the latter
item would increase asset backing and
also boost reserves, which already look
healthy at more than half the paid
ordinary capital.
Why, then, are the shares so low on
the market? There are two main rea-
sons. The most concrete is that in
February the paid ordinary capital of
£206,000 was boosted to £311,000, or
more than 50 p.c., by the conversion of
unsecured notes. So, even if profits
jump 50 p.c. by the end of 1965-66
when the new shares will rank fully for
dividends, earning rates will show little
improvement over the present 10.5 p.c.
level.
This leaves no scope for any dividend
increase, and even less for a cash issue
or a bonus from the reserves. In its
turn, this eliminates expansionary possi-
bilities to a large extent and expansion
is imperative if the new capital is to be
adequately serviced. The Newlands
acquisition was made because directors
had “regard for the need to expand pro-
fitability” but the finance was provided
by increasing the mortgage debenture
with National Mutual by £45,000 to
more than £BO,OOO.
In other words, the company is in
something of a vicious circle, the only
way out being a boosting in earning
rates to a level more like 17 p.c. or
18 p.c. As it is, interest charges took
more than £15,000 before the latest
profit of £22,000 was arrived at.
The other reason for the low market
price is the generally poor opinion held
by investors of the shares. There have
been no ordinary issues since a qne-for-
one in 1950-51. That year earning rate
peaked at 19 p.c., then degenerated to
a loss in 1952-53. Recovery brought
another peak of 17.6 p.c. in 1955-56
and then setbacks culminated in the
1960-61 loss. During this entire period,
dividends did not rise above a mediocre
8 p.c. even in the good years, and one

year they were as low as 5 p.c. Since
the early fifties, the shares have been
below par more often than above, even
when times were good.
Perhaps this was partly due to the
high 20s. par value. Only since Decem-
ber 9 have the shares been split. Since
then the highest price has been 4s. and
the lowest 3s. 9cl. Still, it cannot be
denied that the dominant factors have
been the yo-yo earnings history and the
ungenerous attitude adopted towards
shareholders when years were good. In
any industry where profits fluctuate
violently, shareholders expect a com-
pany to do one of two things—either
pay according to its ability year by year
or maintain a constant rate, drawing on
the reserves built up in buoyant years
when a poor year turned up. VIA has
followed neither of these policies.
In summary, the shares are not worth
buying for capital gains until another
two years have passed and the position
can be reconsidered. For the specula-
tor they offer nothing, as the extremely
poor light in which they are viewed
means only a takeover offer could boost
the price. This, of course, is something
to which VIA is rather vulnerable, being
priced so low. Buying should only be
made for income purposes and any
shareholder holding stock for this reason
must be prepared to sell when bad times
loom. Current prices yield 9.3 p.c. and,
even if dividends were out in the next
two years, returns would still be excel-
lent. Only the astute should buy for
income, however, as VIA’s ice happens
to be rather thin.

slipped from investors’ graces when
profit slumped in 1962-6 T Results for
the latest year did little to restore the
pre-1960 confidence.
However, directors are adopting stern
measures to arrest the trend and, if opera-
tions go as planned, the present year
should see a marked improvement in
fortunes.
The company was formed in 1930 by
the present chairman, Mr David Chrystal,
and operated as a shirt manufacturer. In
1946 a proprietary company was formed
to acquire Mr Chrystal’s interests. In
1948 a parcel of ss. shares was placed
with the public to qualify the company
for Stock Exchange listing.
Paid-up capital at this stage was
£lOO,OOO, but it was rapidly increased to
£150,000 with a one-for-two issue at
par. Twelve months later another issue
at par, this time on a one-for-three basis,
lifted the paid-up ordinary capital to
£200,000. Preference capital of £75,000
was converted in 1959 to 7 p.c. unsecured
notes maturing in 1975.
In June, 1961, however, the company
issued £lOO,OOO in 8 p.c. redeemable
preference shares to the Mutual Life and
Citizens’ Assurance, to meet a demand
by debtors for extended credit.
The company’s main factory is at Bel-
more, in Sydney. It also operates plants
in Dapto and Wollongong on the south
coast, and Huntingdale (Victoria). Ware-
houses and sales centres are in Newcastle,
Brisbane, South Australia, Western Aus-
tralia and Tasmania.
In the latest year, Crystal Clothing
has extended its activities to New Zea-
land, where, in conjunction with Robert-
son Manufacturing Co., it has begun a
jointly owned operation under the name
of Crystal Clothing (NZ) Ltd.
Between 1949 and 1960, profit quad-
rupled. But 1961 saw a sharp reverse in
earnings, with profit falling from a re-
cord £84,212 to £41,627 and dividend
being cut from 15 p.c. to 124 p.c. Pro-
fit in the following year showed a small
recovery to £42,469, equal to 17.2 p.c.
on capital after meeting the preference
charge. The 1963 earnings slumped
to £7919.
This was insufficient to meet the
£BOOO preference charge. Reserves were
also drawn on to meet the steady 12i
p.c. ordinary payout, which required
£25,000. Results in this year were
affected by a special provision of
£40,000 charged against a debt owing
from the Reid Murray group. In addi-
tion, £16,000 was charged against a
provision for stock fluctuation.
Trading in the latest year was no
easier. Sales and production showed

another increase, though a revised mar-
keting policy involving the manufacture
and sales of a substantial portion of
higher grade garments and the clearance
of some raw materials added extra costs.
A further £24,000 was charged against
the stock fluctuation account because of
losses on sales of stock of discontinued
ranges.
Profit for the latest year to June 30
came out at £41,044, equal to 16.5 p.c.
on capital after the preference charge
and giving a fair cover to the steady 12i
p.c. dividend. Tax for the latest year
was only £583 compared with £250 the
previous year and was calculated after
allowing for the losses on the sale of
obsolete stock and tax losses brought
forward from 1963. Depreciation was
virtually steady at £20,525 (£20,925 in
the previous year).
The latest years results were also
afFected by a change in the valuation of
stock in which the cost of finished goods
on hand was calculated to include all
factory overheads and a proportion of
the administrative overheads (the latter
included for the first time), which had
the effect of increasing trading profit
before tax by about £15,000.
The accounts show the company still
has a long way to go before reaching its
former prominence. Stock shows a
further rise, from £1,073,382 to
£1,145,022, based on the new method
of calculation, while trade debtors are
up from £448,444 to £476,267. Pro-
vision for stock fluctuation is now down
to £30,000.
Trade creditors are virtually steady at
£392,243 (£394,791), but the company
has increased its dependence on short-
term borrowings and deposits at call are
up from £556,052 to £679,039. Should
inter-company borrowings tighten, the
company could be faced with the need
to come on the open market for funds
to refinance these borrowings. Bank
overdraft is down from £173,611 to

SPECULATORS DIARY
Looking at the Medium Term
Time for a cautions examination
'fS/’HAT made my blood boil last week
" was a smug remark I heard on the
ABC news. The announcer quoted an
unnamed spokesman as saying that the
market fall this year was to be expected
because of the abnormally high level
that the market reached last year!
I don’t believe it. Late last year the
market was only slightly higher than it
was five years ago. No wonder many
frustrated people are looking for other
avenues of investment.
With a great number of stocks selling
20 p.c. below their 1964 highs, surely
there must be some investments that will
prove very profitable in the medium
term. If you are one of the sheep, you’ll
stay out of the market altogether. On
the other hand, if you cautiously look
around, there seem to be some bargains
available.
Just before launching into these bar-
gains, let me digress slightly. After this
heavy fall everyone seems to agree there
will be some reaction. The big question
is when?
It’s my guess that it will be on the
first rainy day. This probably sounds as
unrelated to the stock market as the
American economist who bases his mar-
ket predictions on the rise and fall of
women's hemlines. However, widespread
rain in the near future could break the
drought and bring about a radical change
in the outlook for primary industry. But
enough of this general talk and into some
action.
One of the heaviest falls this year is
Steel Mills. From a peak of Bs. 3d. the
shares are now back under 6s. Such a
fall would have been understandable in
1963 when earning rate crashed from 26
p.c. to 11 p.c. and dividend was cut from
10 p.c. to 8 p.c. Instead, the interim
report published at the end of January
told of “substantially greater” profits
and a return to the annual dividend rate
of 10 p.c. It may be argued that the
company s dependence on the building
industry is dangerous. Well, it would
be if the share was selling at three
or four times its par value. Yet
this share is only just above par. As a
recovery prospect I bought 400 shares
at an average price of 6s.
Another share now at about the same
price is A. G. Sims. In my enthusiasm
last month for shares not much above
their par value I had selected Sims.
Little did I realise it would be a lot
closer to its par value so quickly. Here
again the general market can be blamed
for the fall in market price. So as much
to bring my average purchase price
down, I bought a further 500 shares at
ss. 7d.
Low-priced securities seem to be the
order of the week, for the final purchase
was 500 Brambles rights at 3s. 6d. Like
most rights on the market at the moment
they are well below their theoretical
value. Yet like the earlier purchases,
the company concerned produced an
excellent interim report. Pre-tax profits
increased by 60 p.c. and gave a very
wide cover to the new 15 p.c. dividend.
With 12s. 6d. to pay, the new shares
will show a dividend yield not much less
than 5 p.c.
From the existing portfolio the only
eliminations were the 1000 Westralian
and 100 John Lysaght. While I only
broke even with Westralian, covering
Lysaght shares was worth £l5.
Transactions for the week were:

500 A. G. Sims, 5/7 £ll6
500 Brambles rts, 3/6 £lO3
100 John Lysaght, 49/6 £252
The weight of the debits in the account
brings the balance down to £245. Kolotex
was the main upset in the portfolio
unfortunately the l-for-4 par issue more
than offset the 30 p.c. profit increase.
Oh, why didn't the directors make it a
bonus issue instead?

Hardware Hopes
A fter the recent interim report, Hard-
ware Holdings’ shareholders must
feel as if they are sitting on a bomb.
Even before its release their chances for
a cash or bonus issue were extremely
high. The 1963-64 year set new records
for sales, profits, earning rates and divi-
dends. At balance date, reserves were
well in excess of paid capital, the build-
ing industry was still booming and the
company had expansionary plans under
its hat. Even more important, no issue
had been made to shareholders since
1960-61. That was a one-for-four at par,
the same as the 1955-56 move which has
been the only other issue since listing.
n Now the interim report has made the
company probably the most issue-prone
stock on the market. After a sales rise of
171 p.c. in the December six months,
directors are expecting that the results for
the full year will “considerably exceed”
those achieved in 1963-64. Moreover, a
shareholders’ meeting has been called for
April 12 with a view to doubling the
nominal capital from its present figure to
£2 million. Paid capital is at present
£640,000 in 10s. shares.

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Checking Animal Diseases
The crucial role of quarantine
A ustralia has one of the most efficient
animal quarantine services in the
world, and it is just as well. Even a
restricted outbreak of foot-and-mouth
disease could cost millions. There are
other diseases which are rampant in
South-East Asia and in Africa—blue
tongue, African horse sickness (affect-
ing not only horses), and so on.
It is an uncomfortable fact that the
newly independent nations of Africa are
amongst the worst offenders. The
European “colonialist” veterinarians
who packed up and left have not been
replaced. While the “emerging nations”
continue to splurge their limited re-
sources on prestige items such as air-
lines, armies, impressive buildings and
visible “proof of progress”, they are
unlikely to be replaced.
Our quarantine laws often cause dis-
comfort to travellers who cannot under-
stand why their pet dogs, cats, and birds
in cages have to be destroyed. Only a
few weeks ago two well-intentioned
migrants from the UK even wanted to
bring in a couple of pet rats. Naturally
this got good coverage in the popular
Press. Harmless little creatures and so
lovable. How uncouth are our quaran-
tine officers!
For the good of all of us it is to be
hoped they continue their hard and fast
attitude to animals from countries which
have the above-mentioned diseases. But
there are loopholes through which
diseases could enter. One has now been
brought to light by a committee repre-
senting the combined farmer organisa-
tions of Victoria.
This committee discovered that ships’
garbage is being burned in a thoroughly
haphazard manner in an open tip less
than three miles from the Newmarket
saleyards in Melbourne. The committee
found that “rats, flies and seagulls”
swarmed around the garbage from ships
from all parts of the world. There were
no fences to keep out scavenging dogs.
Professor D. C. Blood, dean of the
faculty of veterinary science at Mel-
bourne University, confirmed the opin-
ion that seagulls could transfer disease
virus from the tip to the saleyards.
Although it could be claimed, he said,
that the spread of virus from tips like
that at Footscray might not be very
great, it could happen. The close
proximity of the tip to Newmarket was
clearly a danger.
He said the obvious answer to the
ships’ garbage problem was to destroy it
properly in oil-burning or electric incin-
erators. It appeared to him that the
authorities were prepared to gamble the
possible chance of stock diseases spread-
ing from tips against the possibly high
cost of incinerators.
Efficient incinerators do appear an
obvious need. The present tip is like a
scene from London at the time of the
Black Death. Foul-smelling garbage is
covered with sawdust, rubbish and
sweepings from the holds of ships. It is
set alight and burned in a fashion by
grimy workmen wielding long forks and
rakes. It is on the edge of a swamp and
frequently the area is covered in fog
which makes burning the more difficult.
When it rains, as it often does, the fires
simply go out.
One of the farm organisation leaders
in Victoria, Mr P. J. Meehan, of the
Victorian Wheat and Woolgrowers’
Association, believes the position may
be much worse at smaller ports around
the Australian coastline. He points out,
and this is most important, that many of
the thousands of sheep and cattle going
'through Newmarket every day of the
week go back on to properties. They
do not reach a satisfactory price and
are taken home again by the farmer or
else they are stock being shifted from
one part of the State to another and are
held at Newmarket until suitable trans-
port is available. This adds enormously
to the risk of disease.
No one knows for sure if the seagulls
which swarm around the tip are the
same seagulls which frequent the sale-
yards and nearby Flemington racecourse.
They almost certainly would be.
Mr Meehan believes the Federal
Government has a duty to provide the
finance to build efficient incinerators at
all Australian ports. Considering some
of the more spectacular splurges of
public moneys in this country it does
appear a really worthwhile suggestion.
It will not plug the only loophole. The
speed with which the jet airliners cir-
cumnavigate the world these days re-
mains probably the biggest single risk
of exotic disease virus entering Austra-
lia. Within three days a Boeing 707 or
a DCB can touch down and pick up
passengers at, say, Rome, Karachi, New
Delhi, Bangkok, Singapore and Dja-
karta. Only a few months ago there
was a scare when a jet on this route
had to bypass Darwin because of the
weather and land at Alice Springs. Dar-
win has quarantine inspection facilities.
Alice Springs has not. A report got
out that foot-and-mouth had been actu-
ally introduced by this aircraft but was
fortunately amended. Someone had
mistaken the risk for an actual occur-
rence.
The spread of foot-and-mouth in
South-East Asia is causing the United
Nations Food and Agriculture Organi-
sation (FAO) real concern. In Rome,
FAO headquarters, Dr Ross Cockrill re-
turned recently from a two-month trip
through South-East Asia and reported
he was not happy with existing eradica-
tion programmes. South-East Asia re-
mained a part of the world where “ani-
mal diseases were rife”.


Dr Cockrill, Dr Ervin Eichorn and
Australian-born Dr K. V. Kesteven are
urging stronger world livestock quaran-
tine regulations. Dr Kesteven said:
“Today, no country, no matter how iso-
lated, can feel complacent about its
livestock industry. Time is now far
more important than distance. Coun-
tries 5000 miles apart are only nine
or so hours from another by jet air-
craft.” Before jet travel the time taken
by a ship was often a safe quarantine
period for any “bugs” which happened
to be aboard. Today a man could be
walking through a dung pit in India
on Monday and could be inspecting a
stud property in NSW on Friday—still
wearing the same shoes.
Amongst veterinarians in Australia
there is almost universal acceptance of
the theory that sooner or later, pro-
bably within 10 years, we will be hit by
one of these exotic diseases. Despite all
our precautions we just cannot hope to
win every time, not while so many
nations of the world do absolutely no-
thing about checking animal diseases.
They cannot even check diseases affect-
ing their own human populations, let
alone the animals.
But until that unhappy day dawns, as
it probably will, it behoves us to do all
we can to cover the gaps.
Meat Rides High in UK

commodity advertising in Britain is
that of a bronzed surf-rider being borne
shorewards on the shoulder of a huge
blue roller, himself bearing aloft on the
palm of his hand a tray of sun-filled
produce from Down Under. For the
Australian meat industry, the image
could not be more apt. With record
prices for lamb in the season just ended,
beef breaking into the retail market at
last, and both enjoying more esteem
than ever before, Australia’s meat ex-
ports to this country are indeed riding
high.
Fortunately for lamb, the British
market this year was short. Seasonal
conditions caused English lamb to be
marketed with more orderliness than
usual, so it did not reach a sharp peak,
glutting the market. The situation was
also helped by the sale of English lamb
to the Continent—a by-product of the
beef shortage—and by the fact that New
Zealand lamb arrived later than usual
because of shipping troubles.
Demand was also strengthened by the
promotion, which was hotted up in the
past season. Even the Australian pro-
ducers, who belong to a farming com-
munity that is traditionally hard to
please, must be warmed a trifle by the
advances that have lately attended the
image of Australian meat with the Bri-
tish public.
Perhaps the best evidence of the
"arrival” of Australian lamb was its
presence this season in Britain’s snooti-
est store, Harrods. Only a few years
ago, a Harrods meat buyer was credited
with saying that Harrods did not stock
Australian lamb “because it is crossed
with greyhound”. This season they not
only ; stocked it, but branded it as Aus-
tralian and surrounded it with Austra-
point-of-sale material.
Another event of which the Austra-
lian trade authorities are proud was the
holding during the • lamb season of an
Australian lunch for top food news
correspondents at the City of London’s
Butchers’ Hall, where a carving demon-
stration was given by the chief carver
of Stone’s Chophouse. The publicity
obtained from this and other achieve-
ments has lately prompted people in the
meat trade to quip, with an undertone
of seriousness, that Australia is breath-
ing down the neck of rival New Zea-
land.
As yet, however, such a suggestion
is highly figurative. For although the
868,000 Australian lamb carcasses that
this season reached Britain compared
with only 753,000 the year before, the
quantity was minute alongside New
Zealand's 18 million. It was also small
in relation to the volume of lamb ex-
ports considered necessary to get the
best out of this market —a figure put by
the European representative of the Aus-
tralian Meat Board, Mr D. B. Muir-
head, as a minimum of two millions a
year. The most lambs Australia has
ever sent to the United Kingdom in a
year was seven million during the war,
when they were shipped there under
emergency arrangements to keep Britain
alive. Since then the figure has re-
mained much lower.
Bigger numbers of lambs, says Muir-
head, would bring in chains of retailers
whose confidence in the Australian pro-
duct now suffers from fears about ob-
taining continuity throughout the season.
Gratifying though the lamb season
has been, what most excites Australian
meat officials at present is the upsurge
on the British market of Australian
boneless beef—BB,ooo tons for the year
ended December, 1964, compared with
19,000 for 1963. For the first time,
Australian beef, which has always be-
fore gone into manufacturing, contract-
ing and catering, is moving into the re-
tail trade in full view of the public.
Where butchers once winced if you men-
tioned Australian beef, one large group
of 120 shops in the Home Counties is
vigorously promoting it and featuring
special-priced cuts. Each window is
bright with Australiana—a large banner
across the top, a map of the country and
the words “Choice Beef from Australia”,
with this week’s bargain item in the
centre of it all. A big group of butchers
in Birmingham is also pushing Austra-
lian beef.
Backing up these and other efforts is
the versatile surf-rider, this time his tray
carrying not dried fruits or sherry but
a succulent rump< all juicy in full color,
a half slice curving away from the
parent block.
In the present European beef crisis,
with prices performing all sorts of tricks,
Australian beef is helping to give stabi-
lity by providing the housewife with
value for money, and the appreciation
is felt on both sides of the counter.
Shortage of butchers’ labor has also
helped sales of Australian boneless beef,
which requires less handling in shops
than boned kinds and can be stored in
a smaller space.
Although last year’s figure of 88,000
tons is pleasing enough, it does not tell
the whole story, for the rate of dis-
posal towards the end of this period
has been greater than at the beginning
and is presently running at some 10,000
tons a month compared with 19,000
for the whole of 1963.
What of the future? The Argentine
is building up cattle numbers depleted
by disease and drought, but this is un-
likely to have much effect on the pre-
sent shortage before 1967. Lesser
build-ups are also taking place in Aus-
tralia and the United Kingdom.
By ,he time supplies catch up again,
it looks as though Australian beef will
have established itself in Britain on a
basis it has not enjoyed before: identity
and quality. As well, Australian beef is
now appearing on plates in Malta,
Greece, Italy, France, Switzerland, Ger-
many and Sweden, and there are pros-
pects of its reaching Eastern Bloc coun-
tries like Hungary, where negotiations
are now proceeding.
For Australian beef, the European
shortage has meant that instead of
America maintaining its place as the
highest-priced market, prices have
reached parity in all world markets.
This has attracted to Europe much beef
that formerly went to the US. It is this
rather than the quota agreement be-
tween American and Australian Govern-
ments that has caused the diversion of
supplies, for the amount going to Ame-
rica began to shrink long before the
limit on the quota was reached.

in the United Kingdom has been criti-
cised as excessive for a commodity that
returns only £3 million a year. Yet it
is doubtful whether many critics have
taken into account that money spent on
lamb promotion also helps the country’s
beef. Not only that, for if the price
received for Australian lamb in Britain
does not match up to the domestic one,
it must be remembered that lambs ex-
ported away from the home market help
to keep prices there up.
Tails of a Professor
Scientists versus farmers again
|~\nce in a while someone makes a
public statement which really takes
the cake. At a dairy conference in
Auckland, New Zealand, recently, a
Professor I. L. Campbell said that cows
should have their tails cut off because
it would be more hygienic and because
the tail was useless as a fly swat any-
way.
Then he added—and this is the really
interesting part—that he had been ad-
vocating cutting off tails for years, but
“those who are opposed to removing the
tail are typical of the conservatism, pre-
judice and sentiment which hinders
agricultural progress”.
Considering this remarkable state-
ment, it is no wonder that scientists
complain that farmers take far too little
notice of them. If Professor Campbell
had been deliberately trying to set back
scientist-farmer relations 50 years he
could not have done a better job.
To begin with, no one is quite sure
whether he meant the switch (that is
the hairy part of the tail, which is
about a foot in length sometimes) or
the boned part, which is- an extension
of the spine. If he did mean the
switch only, then he was not telling any-
one much at all. Plenty of farmers cut
the switch off now—particularly in
cooler areas where flies are not such a
problem. It does no harm and is alto-
gether painless.
But all dairy farming people, from vets
to farmers and stud breeders, agree that
no one has ever before suggested cutting
the whole tail off. In theory, of course,
it would be little different to cutting off
the tails of lambs (normal procedure) or,
for that matter, fox terriers, dober-
manns and cocker spaniels (normal
procedure also).
If Professor Campbell did mean the
switch, then he should have said so. If
he did, in fact, mean the whole tail, then
he must have known that he needed
more than a bald statement to get his
point across. As it was a symposium
he was addressing, it is just possible
that he was aiming at headlines and
was deliberately obscure.
The point this writer is trying to make
is that farmers will never accept scienti-
fic postulations while scientists insist on
playing the game only by their own
rules. The bald statement that tails
should be cut off is what captured space
for Professor Campbell in the Press of
New Zealand and Australia.
His supporting thesis —that it would
be more hygienic to remove tails and
that they are useless as protection
against flies—does not really stand up.
Not until proved, anyway. True, a cow
cannot swipe flies from her own face
with her own tail. It is not long
enough usually. But by standing head
to tail in groups, as cattle will, flies can
be kept at bay.
Whether it would be more hygienic
to remove tails is debatable. True, the
tail (the inner edge in particular) does
frequently become encrusted with drop-
pings. In most milking bails (whether
herringbone or the true bail type), how-
ever, the cows are regularly washed
down before they are milked. Like-
wise in many bails (including the her-
ringbone) the tails of the cows are
pegged back at milking time. In others
the tails are not pegged back. But all
milk has to pass exhaustive quality test-
ing before it reaches the public.
Any improvement in hygiene would
have to be proved by Professor Camp-
bell, not merely stated. All this, though,
is really beside the point.
It is his second statement about “con-
servatism, prejudice, and sentiment
which hinders agricultural progress” that
really counts. Here we have the clue to
the scientific mind and its inability, too
often, to understand why ideas are not
always accepted.
Because a man disagrees with Pro-
fessor Campbell does not . necessarily
mean that he is conservative, prejudiced
and sentimental. And if he is, is that
necessarily such an awful thing?
Apparently Professor Campbell has not
considered one aspect of all this which,
to this writer’s mind, is just as import-
ant as any. If a man is to spend most
of his working life—with little free time
—looking after cows, it might help just
a little if he likes cows and likes to see
them as nature made them: with their
tails on.
As Professor Campbell is occupier of
a chair of dairy science, he might pon-
der on the values of human sentiment.
Being altogether practical, it is feasible
to argue that cows are unnecessary with,
or without, tails. For all the advertising
that goes with it, any dietitian will tel!
you that milk can be readily replaced
by vegetable matter churned from a
machine. The machine can be auto-
mated and one technician can control
a whole battery from a control panel.
When that day comes —and sentiment
disappears from the earth —there will be
no need for chairs of dairy science
either.
This writer is quite prepared to admit
that, from the purely scientific view-
point, there is not such a great deal of
difference between removing tails
(which is not done) to removing horns
(which quite often is) and removing
testicles from male calves (done in the
majority* of cases). What is at issue
here is the attitude that all farmers are
fools if they do not do exactly as Big
Brother tells them.

WHICH CAR
MAKES NEW
MEAN WHAT
IT MEANS?
The only new thing about some cars is
the name. Not this one. BMC Morris
1100 is all new—from bonnet to boot!
It’s the car you hoped would happen.
It breaks through with revolutionary
engineering. Take, for example, the
Hydrolastic* suspension unit. It floats
the car on fluid so it can’t bounce or roll
or pitch. And it never needs mainten-
ance. Take the special sealed cooling
system. Take the sound-dampening
rubber-mounted sub-frames. Take all
that stretch-out inside space. Why not
take the BMC Morris 1100? and
ride in the cushioned comfort of con-
toured seating. Listen to approving
comments from friends at the sweet,
low styling; from mechanics at the
front-wheel drive system that packs
engine, clutch and gearbox into one
amazing unit. The BMC Morris 1100
looks like the future and acts
like it. It’s the car that puts the
family first. Now’s the time to try the
Miraculous BMC Morris 1100 the
car you hoped would happen.
