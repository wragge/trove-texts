TALBINGO HOTEL
I don’t know if it was duiing Clive
Morse’s regime at the Talbingo Hotel
that, when David Campbell and l were
going up for a weekend’s fishing, they
put one of us in the yardman's room:
but after reading The Guest Years of
My Life (Angus and Robertson) I
wouldn’t be surprised.
Not that Mr. Morse made a habit of
treating his guests so disrespectfully.
On the contrary, though he seems to
have had an unkind though understand-
able objection to their lingering over
the dinner-table, he seems to have given
them the time of their lives: —
We tried to make them happy
during their stay, and the rules ior
doing this were extremely simple—
no regulations or restrictions bar the
essential ones, and any requests for
special little favors always granted
cheerfully, if they wanted to wear
shorts and a dirty shirt to meals, we
let them. If they wanted an extra
blanket, or water for their hot-water
bottle, we gave it. If they wanted to
come into the kitchen and boil the
baby's milk or make a cup of tea,
Cook gave the o.k. . . .
But camping in the yardman's room
seems, nevertheless, the kind of thing
that was liable to happen at Talbingo.
There was the time, for instance, when
Mr. Morse's guest, young Eddison.
set a tripwire along the veranda and
caught (full-length on the concrete) his
own father; or the time Mrs. Williams’s
trout, swimming happily about the
refrigerator, got into the green jelly
and couldn't be found for breakfast;
or the night the ghost, off a grey dog
stalked solemnly into tjie bar and out
again; and the occasion when Mr.
McGrew couldn’t be persuaded to go to
bed because he was down the paddock
listening enchantedly to the sound of
the water-pump, which he thought was
a mechanical bullfrog.
However. I really must exonerate
Mr. Morse from any deliberate inten-
tion of putting a guest in the yardman’s
room. It was a fairly nice room, any-
how. except for the yardman’s socks
under the pillow. Presumably having
gone to bed before 3 a.m.. Mr. Morse
had kindly left a note telling us to take
the second and third rooms on the right,
or some such: but the truth was. having
been delayed a little in the Royal Hotel
in Gundagai. where I was collecting an
old bush song from a shearers' cook,
and further delayed by floods all along
the road from Tumut to Talbingo. to
avoid which the car seemed naturally
to want to climb the embankment, we
somehow misunderstood his directions.
But what has Mr. Morse to say about
what happened next day? The Tumut
River which we had come to fish, that
glorious, sparkling stream dashing over
the granite so close to the hotel that
you could just about cast a fly into it
from the veranda (well, if you made a
long cast), was in roaring flood, unfish-
able. So we went up top to Kiandra
and tried the Three-Mile Dam. which
would have been more fishable if it
hadn’t been completely frozen-over;
and then when. wet. frozen and fishless,
we got back to Mr. Morse’s hospitable
premises, some vile scoundrel had been
up the Jounama Creek, which runs
round the back of the hotel and wasn’t
as flooded as the Tumut. and had
caught a two-pounder with a worm.
Mr. Morse, rightly enough, has
nothing to say about this. For one
thing, the worm can’t possibly be men-
tioned in nice society; and for another
thing, these are small personal matters
which Mr. Morse wouldn’t even remem-
ber; and I only mention them because
those are the sort of memories which
his pleasant book will evoke in all
readers who have stayed at Talbingo,
as most New South Wales trout-
fishermen have at one time or another;
and because, on a larger, more hilarious
scale, those are the kind of incidents
of Which his book is made-up . . . like
the time the youth got the big fish on
the set-line, and the awful night they
ate the barbecued sucking-pig, and Mr.
Morse's harrowing adventures when he
tried to take the brindle cow to the
bull.
But (as perhaps the bull indicates—
he was called Chifley) Mr. Morse’s
book is by no means confined to trout-
fishing. It is a book about keeping a
country hotel in New South Wales, and
should interest not only tourists who
have dropped-in at Talbingo but any
Australian reader anywhere for its
comedy, its hotel-lore, its pictures of
modern tourists in a place that used to
be high and wild and handsome and
still is not too tame.
The Morse family took-over a lease
of the house part of the hotel in 1948
and this is a lively, amusing, almost
day-by-day account of how they got on
with it. A rarity in books of its kind,
it is not overloaded with history and
local lore; it is Talbingo alive and con-
temporary; but with its pictures of some
of the more picturesque locals and its
descriptions of the mobs of sheep and
cattle passing their hotel on their way
up top to feed on the snow-leases, it
never loses sight of its mountain;
setting.
English or Irish writers, such as
Robert Gibbings. do this sort of boot
rather better than we do. They run not
less humorously but deeper and quieter.
They don’t feel that they have to whoop
things up so much. They have a more
tactful way with some of the impolite
details. But this is. all the same, the
kind of regional writing that Australia
needs: the firm picture of one small
place, human and humorous enough to
interest everybody; and Mr. Morse does
it on the whole so well that, if he
strikes it lucky, he may find he has'
written a bestseller.

WHILE THE WORLD BURNS
THE Presidential conventions of the
A two great American political
parties have made July their own, and
the spectacle so far has been neither
edifying nor dignified—not that either
quality is ever a feature of these tradi-
tional junketings.
Still, if the world had reached the
millenium, with complete and perman-
ent peace, no threat of war or famine,
the Los Angeles Convention might be
easier for non-Americans to take. As
things are. with Khrushchev uttering
threats of war, Russian rockets being
projected 8000 miles into the centre of
the Pacific, Europeans in Central
Africa threatened with massacre and
the United States itself rent with
dangerous dissension over the color
question, the whole show and its pre-
ludes have been actually frightening.
It can be taken for granted that if
the fun-and-games are not as prolonged
and riotous at the Republican Con-
vention in Chicago later in the month
it will only be because opposition to
the party heads’ favorite, Richard
Nixon, is not so diversified and the
issues not so controversial as at Los
Angeles.
It may seem incongruous that the
Democratic Convention, staged by a
party supposed to represent the poor
and oppressed, not to mention the negro
minority—which in some southern
States is a valuable near-majority—
should be held at Los Angeles, the
world capital of ostentatious display.
But there is obviously “Democracy”
and democracy.
The campaign preliminary to the
Convention, in which young millionaire
Senator John Kennedy early blotted-
out the hopes of his competitors, broke
all records in high-pressure sales-
manship and length of operation—two
solid years.
No holds were barred; boots, singing
infants and bloodhounds were welcome
in the fray.
Money flowed like the Gulf Stream.
Aeroplanes were expendable, and no
publicity stunt too noisy, too flam-
boyant, vulgar or futile to be fed with
dollars.
Indeed, the only part of the U.S.
millionaire “democracy” which seemed
to be silent were the Catholic Irish, bent
on persuading the Protestant vote
either that they weren’t there or that
they were all Republicans.
fYF policy, nothing substantive seems
to have emerged on either side.
John Kennedy has (in the elegant words
of “Time”) “whooshed across the politi-
cal skies ... in his jet-propelled band-
wagon,” too fast for anybody to carry
away any real sense of solid planning,
but only fleeting impressions like those
of the bemused negroes airlifted to
fashionable Georgetown, the Bellevue
Hill of Washington (D.C.), a “red-
carpet welcome” and given a punch
which one thought had gin in it which
turned out to be cognac, “chicken with
some fancy,kinds of eggs,” white'men
waiting on them and a choice of
“about 100 dollars’-worth of cigars
from some foreign country.”
The only issues on which everybody
agreed before what an Australian
correspondent described as “the raz-
matazz, hoopla and orgiastic horrors”
of the 100-dollar-a-plate dinners and
rain of candy-bars and expensive gifts
done-out in the party’s colors was con-
tained in Senator Fulbright’s attack
on the bumbling and fumbling of the
Eisenhower Administration over the
U-2 affair. He declared that this had
brought the “prestige of the U.S. broad
to the lowest point in history.” and the
Republicans replied that his attack was
“second only to the assaults of Mos-
cow.”
On the economic side the Democrats
vary, as they have been competing with
each other in prospective giving; but the
Kennedy-line has appeared to be a
return to the old, gay Rooseveltian do-
gooder theories, operated by open-
handed lovers of the people devoting
their lives towards applying the power
of the Government to “promote faster
growth”—a policy which Vice-Presi-
dent Nixon describes as “growthman-
ship.” This, and transferring national
resources from free enterprise to the
“public sector,” so that White House
may become the fountainhead oF all
benevolence as in the days when F.D.R.
was kind and generous to everybody—
even to Stalin at Yalta.
It is very difficult to believe that the
United States, engaged in its orgy of
candidate-choosing amid luxury and
ballyhoo, is the same nation that claims
to be the most powerful on earth, the
dictator of world morality, the arbiter
of orderly revolution and of the sound
and discreet things of life, the source
of succor and uplift for the poor of
the earth.
At a time when neighboring Cuba
was breaking its treaties and seizing
U.S. and other properties, abusing the
U.S. in the vilest language, the Demo-
crats were engaged in this absurd show.
The loss of £4OO million in capital
assets is a mere fleabite against the
background of ostentatious American
wealth.
The U.S. seems almost oblivious to
the fact that its co-operators in the
Organisation of American States, which
has subsisted for 70 years, with the
Pan-American Union as its Central
Headquarters operating from Washing-
ton, appears to be disintegrating.
Mexico looks like going over to the
enemy, and other Latin-American
countries are waiting to see what force
stands behind Khrushchev’s sentence of
death on the Monroe Doctrine.
Washington appears not to have
heard his announcement from the
heights of Austria—that “Communism
is the elixir of my life. I want to see
with my own eyes within my own life-
time the Red Flag flying over the whole
planet.”
This remark, brutal and unmistak-
able in meaning, has scarcely pene-
trated the blare and rock-’n’-roll of
Presidential electioneering in the United
States.
'THERE is evidence in Parliamentary
A debates in the United Kingdom and
in the steady wariness of Prime
Minister Macmillan that the British
Government is fully aware of the
imminent peril. *
In Italy Communist deputies have
been arrested after riots; in the Congo
peaceful civilians have been fleeing
for their lives from savages incited by
the urgings of Communism and of the
cunning entrepreneurs of violence who
have used the fatuous tools of aggres-
sion in U.N.
In France, Thorez is organising
openly and avowedly a plan to main-
tain “continuous strikes” to destroy the
de Gaulle Government. In Britain
the Communists are struggling, as in
Australia, for domination of the key
unions and of Labor political policy,
aiming to turn it into the Kremlin
Assembly line.
In Japan the snake-dancers are rest-
ing their ankles; on the borders of
India the slaughter of Tibetans goes on.
Since American press-agencies and
political magazines call the tune of
public opinion in most of the Western
world, this apparent failure to appreci-
ate the ominousness of what is going on
reflects itself dangerously in Western
press and radio.
In plain fact, the world is probably
as near to war and the civilised West in
as great danger as at any time since
August, 1939.


"ON MY LEFT 'KID' KENNEDY. ON MY RIGHT..."


PLAIN ENGLISH
Congo Chaos
The Congo is shaped like a great balloon
with its narrow access to the sea at the
mouth of the great river, its capital
nearly opposite to the fonqer French
Congo capital of Brazzaville. The capital,
Leopoldville, has about 300,000 people
and is full of new buildings of modern
type- .
The eastern interior parts are rich in
minerals, particularly copper ; the north-
west corner is also a mining district.
The rest lives on its exports of tropical
agricultural products and on the mineral
wealth of the east and north-west.
Congo holds altogether about 19
million people, in an area the size of
Queensland and N. S. Wales, and has
an unsavory record of cruelty and
disorder.
The cruelty at one stage was on the
side of the Belgians, though in recent
decades their rule has been as benign
as is possible in a country in which three
kinds of negro, Nilotic, Sudanese and
Bantu, love to cut each other to pieces
in tribal wars and in which pygmies,
gorillas and 90,000 whites are scattered
over the countryside. Many of the Bel-
gians have been permanently settled as
farmers.
The recent history of the Congo is a
lesson for Australia in New Guinea. The
first plan for its independence, pushed
forward by Communist agitators and
local opportunists with the fierce backing
of European Socialists, was for a four-
year preparation. This was opposed by
the mining companies as being too short;
by the Belgian Socialists and oppor-
tunists eager to get their hands on the
spoil, as too long.
A savage rebellion last year and the
pressure of the Belgian Socialists pre-
cipitated the retirement of the Belgian
Government and the handing-over of the
huge country to a political set-up which
couldn’t even agree on a Premier.
The two chief aspirants were Kasa-
vubu, a Bakongo tribesman, \ educated
originally for the priesthood, later a
teacher and timber-company clerk,
founder of the Abako party and the
power behind the bloody insurrectionary
riots last year ; and Lumumba, educated
as a Catholic, then at a Methodist mis-
sion, trained by the Government as a
postal employee, with a jail sentence for
substantial embezzlement to top-off his
civil-service career and a course as a
brewery-salesman among the natives to
top-off his persuasiveness. Lumumba
won and Kasavubu accepted the Presi-
dency, a decorative office, to save a foot-
hold from which to use the axe on his
adversaries —literally, if his record stands
for anything.
The results have been tragic—every
tribe at another’s throat, murder and
rape of white women by the rebellious
troops of the Force Publique, from
which the Belgian officers were igno-
miniously sacked.
Belgian and other foreign houses have
been ransacked, white men beaten. The
Belgians, forced to send paratroops to
save and protect their nationals, have
been threatened savagely by Khrushchev
as aggressors. Mr. Hammarskjold, on
the authority of the Security Council,
has sent along his Fred Karno army.
Belgian troops, , having assured
quietude, have handed-over some areas,
including the capital, to the U.N. force,
but in the north and in Katanga they
are still in possession and keeping order.
The one stable native figure seems to
be Tshombe, a missionary-educated pro-
European, the Premier of the copper-
province of Katanga, adjacent to
Rhodesia.
He has -announced his intention to
proclaim the independence of Katanga,
saying that the adjacent Kasaj and Kivu
provinces will join him. This move
would rob Western Congo of its
ability to live as a modern State, save
by grace of the eastern regions. Tshombe
seems to have his eye on the possibility
of a central State which would embody
the Congo and Rhodesian copper-belts.
Disturbances in his area have been
limited, though the Italian Consul in
Elizabethville (the capital) was murdered
before Tshombe made a Belgian major
commander of ’the police and armed
forces, to “act in my name.”
When this was written, things were
quietening down, and Khrushchev’s
threats seemed to have had no effect,
though the Belgian Ambassador to Mos-
cow had been called home for consulta-
tion and the chaos in Congo was being
supplemented by disorder and high feel-
ing in Belgium, with the newly-rescued
Colonists raging and the Socialists becom-
ing remarkably unpopular.
Exhausts at Flemington
A first-class row is building-up in
Melbourne on the proposal of the V.R.C.
committee to negotiate with the car-
racing interests for the construction of
a motor-track at Flemington. Many
members, especially the old-timers, are
genuinely shocked at the proposal.
The chief objection is to the crossing
of the famous track "twice by the pro-
posed car-course and the slicing-off of
30ft. of the paddock lawns for much of
the length of the straight.
The protagonist of the plan to bring
cars to Flemington is Sir Chester Mani-
fold, whose energetic chairmanship has
resulted in the belated remodelling of
the public accommodation, the sponsor-
ing of the off-course tote and the £25,000
Centenary Cup this year. (On high days
at Flemington he can be seen walking
alone over the racecourse to see how the
populace is faring and feeding.)
He claims the 30ft. green concrete strip
would blend with the lawns, and that
movable ramps would. be used for the
crossings to prevent any damage to the
course. It seems agreed that the 2j-miles
circuit would be one of the greatest car-
racing tracks in the world, and that
famous events could be run at Fleming-
ton introducing the beautiful course to
a new generation.
The chairman is out to get the money
and is making no secret of it. The
V.R.C. committee’s expectation is a share
of the car-racing profits amounting to
about £25,000 a year, a revenue needed
to recompense the club for the loss of
rentals from the Melbourne Racing Club
when it moves to its new course at
Sandown Park.
None of these considerations, however
is likely to placate the Flemington-lovers'
especially the veteran members, and no
doubt they will throw their silk hats in
the ring at the annual meeting a few
weeks hence.
Trade Problems Looming
{From Canberral
Tncreasing difficulties in overseas-
A trading operations are looming large
as the biggest headache to be faced by
the Government in the near future.
Major problems include: U.S. pro-
posals to increase tariffs on lead and
zinc ; the sharp increase in imports fob
lowing the virtual abolition of licensing
last February ; the U.K. request to Aus-
tralia to waive tariff-preferences on a
number of items entering Britain ; prob-
lems arising for local industries follow-
ing the end to dollar discrimination in
imports.
Of these problems enumerated above,
perhaps the most important is the
British request for Australia to waive
preferences. Despite the assurances by
Minister for Trade McEwen that
Britain’s membership of the E.F.T.A.
will not weaken Australia’s trade, the
omens are that it will do exactly that.
While the items on which Australia
has already agreed to waive preferences
are not significant, what guarantee is
there that Britain, in the future, will not
be forced —through its membership of
E.F.T.A. —to seek further concessions?
~ The second major problem is the flood
of imports of certain goods, such as
motors for power lawn-mowers, and
rifles and sporting-guns, which has fol-
lowed the end of dollar-discrimination
in imports. Already Australian manufac-
turers of some of these goods have asked
the Government to take emergency
action under the provisions of the
G.A.T.T.
Imports of these items are one of the
reasons for the sharp increase in overall
imports since February, which resulted
in Australia having a favorable trade-
balance of only a little over £l3 million
for the last financial year.
Trade authorities are hoping the rise
in imports will start to level-off very
soon. If it does not, Australia looks like
finishing the current year with a very
adverse trade-balance, unless the call for
increased exports is answered —or there
is a surprise re-introduction of import
restrictions.
Stately Negotiators
Negotiations for a settlement of the
overtime dispute on the Victorian
ways continue at a pace (designed hy
both parties) which can be described
only as Statelier Than Thou. Both seek


to convey the impression that a settle-
ment is of little importance, but by this
pretence they deceive nobody except
themselves— certainly not each other.
The latest move by the Railways Com-
missioners has been to leave the less
important suburban stations unmanned
after 8.30 p.m. while appealing to
passengers to be honorable and pay their
fares as usual. They have also hinted
that further restrictions will be intro-
duced. . , . _ ,
It is nearly six months since Sunday
trains ran in Victoria. This has resulted
in a saving of about £IO,OOO a'week to
the Commissioners and a substantial loss
to railwaymen, some of whom earned
£6 by Sunday work; but the chief
sufferers are, of course, families depen-
dent on the railways for transport.
The dispute, which began when rail-
waymen instituted an overtime-ban after
being refused service grants at arbitration
and with which the Commissioners com-
plied by making the loss of overtime as
costly as possible for the railwaymen,
has permanently damaged both parties.
The Railways have lost a substantial
section of passenger-traffic for ever, and
efficient employees, bored with it all
and with the loss of overtime, are drift-
ing away. The trade-unionists have lost
heavily financially and must lose in the
end, as the Victorian Government has
averred it will not capitulate to Com-
munist J. J. Brown.
Christmas Island Australians
From C. I). Reeve, Christmas Island, Indian
Ocean: —
I have been living on Christmas Island
for over two years, and during that period
have seen the island administrated by Singa-
pore, under its own administration whilst it
was the Colony of Christmas Island, and
finally, from October 1, 1958, administered
by Australia. It is of Australia’s administra-
tion that I write.
Enclosed is a copy of the Government
notice wherein the publication of the granting
of Australian citizenship was gazetted. It
states that any resident holding a British
passport can automatically become an Aus-
tralian citizen. Recently two Chinese have
become Australian citizens under this Act,
and it would appear to me that this has
created an easy access for Asians to become
Australian citizens. I may add that on the
most recent visit of the Minister of Terri-
tories this subject of citizenship was broached,
but the Minister refused to discuss the
matter.
In explaining the Christmas Island
Bill to the House of Representatives in
Canberra on August 21, 1958, the
Minister, Paul Hasluck, explained that
British subjects who were residents
immediately before Christmas Island
Passed to Australia could apply for
Australian citizenship. But the provi-
sions did not apply to people resident
°n the island for a temporary or special
purpose. He added that a very small
number of people on the island might
regard it as their home, but the number
would be very small. Of the 2650
People on the island, the big majority.
Were a phosphate-industry work-force
§ ol ng to and coming from Singapore.
hKo mrnon wealth Year Book for
58 says that the population of
nristmas Island on October 1, 1958,
consisted of 1937 Chinese, 512 Malays,
161 Europeans and 16 Indians. Accord-
ing to Mr. Hasluck’s explanation, most
of these would be temporary residents,
and not eligible to apply for Australian
citizenship.
Deficit Cut
[From Canberra]
As widely predicted, the Commonwealth
Government ended 1959-60 with a deficit
of only £29 million—less than half the
estimated gap of £6O million between
receipts and expenses.
A very satisfactory result for the
Government ; it will give Treasurer Holt
a great boost in his plans to produce a
balanced financial record this financial
year.
Higher income-tax collections, as a
result of substantial wage-increases in the
past 12 months, together with buoyancy
of retail sales and consequent higher
sales-tax receipts were the main reasons
for the comparatively small deficit
recorded.
However, it cannot be assumed that be-
cause the Government has succeeded in
cutting its deficit in half there is any scope
for tax remissions this year. It is under-
stood that tax concessions of any kind
are “out.” The Government wants to
keep a tight hand on money in the next
12 months to combat uncomfortable
inflationary trends.
The main way of achieving this is to
avoid deficit budgeting, and to do so the
Government will need every penny it can
lay' its hands on. Instead of tax-cuts
some slight increases could be possible
to provide the extra cash that will be
needed for some assistance to pensioners
and others on fixed incomes.
A series of Cabinet meetings over the
next three weeks will knock the Budget
into its final shape for presentation to
Parliament on August 16. Already de-
partmental estimates have been sent back
for pruning, but these will be back on
the Cabinet-table shortly for the final
cutting.
Arctic Furphy
Moscow will have to produce a better
yarn than the one so far advanced on
the “shooting-down” of the RB-47 of the
U.S. Electronic Survey-force.
Moscow has taken two members of
the crew to be tried “with all severity”
for their part in “spying” on the
Workers’ Only Fatherland.
Khrushchev has announced that the
only reason he did not bomb the British
base from which the machine came was
that the aircraft didn’t actually succeed
in penetrating the U.S.S.R. deeply.
He can, on the facts, tell this to the
Marines.
On July 2 the Americans reported
that the aircraft was missing 73.3 deg.
N. lat. and about 35 E. long.—i.e., in the
open sea roughly 500 miles from the
Russian-Norwegian border on the Kola
Peninsula. It had been based at Brize-
Norton in Oxfordshire.
An alert to shipping was sent out
from Bodo, northern Norway, and a
large number of U.S. aircraft were sent;
also planes from Norway.
Among the responses from ships
warned to look-out for boats or wreckage
was a message from the Russian salvage-
vessel Kapitan Afanasiev, which indi-
cated its willingness to join in the search.
Vardo radio announced that it was
due to arrive in the search - area at
10 a.m. on July 3. A Norwegian Air
Force spokesman said on July 3 that the
Russian vessel was operating independ-
ently of the search-organisation.
The same day Murray Snyder,
Assistant Secretary of Defence for Public
Affairs in Washington, said he was
sure the plane would not have made
any deliberate attempt to fly over
Russian territory, and Washington
expressed its feeling that the fact that
a Russian Government vessel was join-
ing in the search would dispel any
speculation about a landing in Soviet
territory.
All this was published widely in the
U.S. and European press. The search
continued and was well publicised. But
on July 11, 10 days after the aircraft
was reported missing, the Russians sud-
denly announced that it had been shot-
down 14 miles north of Cape Svatoy
Nos, flying in the direction of Arch-
angel. The Kremlin handed furious
notes to the U.S., British and Norwegian
Ambassadors.
The notes said that the plane was
observed by a.-a. defences “in the
Barentz Sea near the Kola Peninsula . . .
a military aircraft flying towards the
frontier of the U.S.S.R.” A fighter sent
up established that it was a U.S.A.F.
bomber with military markings ; that it
violated the Russian frontier, and, despite
orders to follow the fighter and land, it
“continued to penetrate into Soviet space
towards Archangel. So it was shot-
down over Soviet territorial waters east
of Cape Svatoy Nos.”
The note claimed that from the state-
ments of the two crew-members cap-
tured alive the plane was a “six-engined
reconnaissance-bomber of the RB-47
type, belonging to Wing No. 55 of the
American Strategic Air Force, and per-
forming a special mission of military-
intelligence character.” It was armed
with “two 20-mm. guns and ammunition
and had special electronic and photo-
graphic intelligence apparatus.”
If true, this yarn would have meant
that the Americans had gone mad and
should be certified! They would have
been—according to the yarn —right on
a busy air- and sea-route leading into
the inland waters of the White Sea and
Archangel, flying a bomber as big as a
house in certain view of everybody and
the Russian radar, and, in the event of
discovery, prepared to fight the Russian
Air Force with a couple of 20-mm. guns.
The United States reply from Presi-
dent Eisenhower is a categorical denial
which will be documented before the
Security Council. That U.N. body should
demand the presence of the captured
fliers as witnesses.

current values to be worth £25 million.
The Turner in the Y. and J. gallery is

And only cats and chooks are shoed,

a knowing grin: “Oh, that’s Sid. He
always asks for dry petrol. Sid and his
wife operate a joint bank-account —he
can’t get any money out of the bank
without his missus knowing about it.”
“But what,” I asked, “has that to do with
dry petrol?” “Easy,” replied the atten-
dant. “You see, when Sid asks for five

charge the joint-account with five and

one attribute. At around 9.30 each morn-
ing, unable to stand the gnawing hunger
any longer, he’d haul out an enormous
pile of sandwiches and knock-over about
half. At 11 o’clock morning-tea he’d
finish the rest. The next two hours must
have been sheer agony for him, and by
just on 1 p.m., when we stopped for
lunch, he’d have that same look in his
eye a pooch has when you dangle his
lead in front of him prior to the nightly
stroll. Then he’d burn the asphalt on
his way up to the fur-pie foundry. He’d
polish off four, followed by what looked
like half-a-treeful of fruit. We dubbed
him “The Ruminant.” It couldn’t pos-
sibly be, we contended, that he could
get through all that fodder without the

that he had been a clergyman, and at
the time was thinking of another trip to
Britain, but I doubt whether his sales
on the platform financed the plan. He
was upstanding and sprightly as he
walked the length of the platform and
back with his basket of fruit and sweets.
His cry then was “Slipstone bananas
and Fiji peaches,” and as it was taken-
up by the schoolboys and this led to
pretended anger his sales were helped.
The production of a watch-shaped clock
was another help for all who wanted
to know the time. But the sanatorium
didn’t help his sales; travellers were
scared by the name, and those visiting

“Sarah,” at the top of the steps, was wait-
ing to hurry her coach to the home to give

Only one thing wrong with it —the bus,

better ways of doing things these days.
They, for instance, had a small station-
wagon, drove it all round Britain and
then drove it into an aircraft and three-

A Policeman's Lot...
At Good Old Nyngan
By "SPINIFEX"
Lately lifted sensationally
into the news headlines,
with a mayor, a journal-
ist and a horsewhip as
leading characters, good old
Nyngan, out where the sun
goes down in N.S.W., also had
its lively moments when I was
there as a young constable
many long years ago.
Some time after my transfer
thither Constable Stone
married one of the local lasses,
a charming young lady who
was a Miss Priest before she
became Mrs. Stone. That
usually meant a transfer. A
constable stationed in a coun-
try town amid his own, or his
wife’s, relatives could easily
find himself in an embarrassing
position.
So Glanville (otherwise
“Joe”) Stone departed, and in
his place came one Richard
Michell, complete with wife,.
Dick Michell was an un-
usual sort of policeman, in
more ways than one. In the
first place, his dad was, or had
been, England’s High Commis-
sioner for Cyprus, and, also,
Dick had for an aunt a real
live duchess —the Duchess of
Bedford.
1 understand the lady was
regarded, in some quarters, as
slightly eccentric. If that were
so she had nothing on her
nephew. He seemed to have
an absolute gift for doing the
wrong thing, or for doing the
Tight thing in the wrong way.
He was a big chap with a pair
°f wide shoulders and a
noticeably small head—two
features markedly evident\ in
photographs showing Dick in
his college football-team . . .
logger, of course.
Dick didn't drink or smoke,
™t he and his pleasant little
W| fe was much addicted to
sweets and expensive foods, so
owards the end of the month
e was always stone-broke till
a n English letter, bearing an
embossed ducal coronet, came
on g, which it did as regu-
a|ry as police payday. From
Dick would gleefully extract
cr,s P new English tenner and
st Urry to °ld Frank Barringer’s

Ust H up on chocolates and
ot her dainties.
*ck s constant companion
s a n old retriever dog he
called Curly ; and to Curly his
conversation, what there was
of it, was mostly addressed.
In all, an amiable fellow,
Dick —but you never knew
what he’d do next.
T WAS living in the police-
barracks—part of an old
weatherboard building on the
main street. It had once been
part of a pub, and where it
stood there’s now another pub
—a much better onej
One night, when Dick was
on night-duty, I was awakened
by a chorus of loud voices and
the sound of a struggle close
by. Though I didn’t know it
then, it was after midnight,
and outside there was brilliant
moonlight. I hopped out of
bed in my pyjamas and went
out with bare feet.
Dick had a hold on a chap
as big as himself, and the chap
had a hold on a telegraph-pole.
Dick was trying vainly to tug
him off.
A smaller chap, who had
apparently been celebrating,
was weaving round the strugg-
ling pair and shouting alcoholic
advice. No one appeared to
be taking the slightest notice
of him.
Both contestants seemed
utterly weary. I learned after-
wards that they’d been tussling,
further down the street, for
about half-an-hour. Now there
appeared to be a stalemate.
Though I was only a light-
weight, I had the advantage
of being fresh. Because of
that, I had little difficulty in
prising the big fellow away
from the telegraph-pole-
only to see him charge across
the footpath and fasten on
to the picket-fence. When-
we pulled him away from the
fence, the picket came with
him.
It seemed to me I was get-
ting a pretty raw deal. The
footpath was of coarse gravel,
and I was barefooted. Both
the big fellows wore heavy
boots, and they took turns in
tramping all over my feet.
When we got to the charge-
room, which was only 50
yards away, and someone lit
the oil-lamp, I got a good
look at our reluctant guest.
He was the village black-
smith, and one of the town-
ship’s most respected citizens.
He was, in fact, the Mayor.
His loquacious follower
was also a local resident, and
quite a decent bloke when he
wasn’t celebrating birthdays.
T hadn’t the faintest idea
what it was all about, but
there seemed to be distinct
possibilities of troubl e—
for us.
Flashman, the solicitor, who
lived nearby, and Hethering-
ton, the Commercial Bank
manager from across the
street, were hovering around
to see what they could do for
the Mayor, and the talkative
drunk had also trailed along
vocally contributing slabs of
wisdom.
With considerable enthq-
siasm Dick Michell tossed
the celebrator into the street,
then proceeded to charge the
Mayor with obstructing a
police-officer in the execution
of his duty.
The Mayor was released on
bail to appear before the
court at 10 a.m., and; still
barefooted, I hobbled back to
bed . . .
At the court Dick was really
in a spot of bother.
According to his own evi-
dence he had originally started
to arrest the garrulous drunk
when the Mayor good-
naturedly intervened and
offered to take the blithered
one home. An argument
developed, and Dick decided
to put the Mayor in cold-
storage instead.
In his cross-examination
Flashman said: “You’ve
charged my client with
obstructing you in the execu-
tion of your duty. What duty
were you endeavoring to per-
form when he obstructed
you?”
“I was trying to arrest his
companion,” said Dick.
“But,” said Flashman, “his
companion came into the
charge-room, and you threw
him out. Why didn’t you
arrest him then?”
Dick didn’t reply. Instead,
he gazed at the ceiling. Reply-
ing to these questions called
for thought, and Dick disliked
thinking. He would far
sooner have been talking to
Curly. For one thing. Curly
never asked awkward
questions.
In the end they fixed it up
to the satisfaction of all con-
cerned. The police withdrew
the charges against the
Mayor, and the Mayor apolo-
gised for “his impulsive
action.” Honor was satisfied.
\lThen the court adjourned,
Flashman said to me:
“Look, old man, I’m not
suggesting you deliberately
misled the court, but you
swore that my client fulled a
picket from the police-station
fence. That’s impossible!”
“It may be,” I said, “but he
did it. Come and have a
look.”

POLITICAL POINTS
When counting ceased in the two Vic-
torian by - elections on Saturday
night Balaclava, as was only to be ex-
pected, was a sure thing for the Liberal
candidate, R. H. Whittorn. In Bendigo,
also as expected, the issue was still in
doubt, with Labor candidate N. L. Beaton
over 1000 votes behind the combined
totals of his two opponents and 6000
votes still outstanding. At that stage he
was in very much the same position as
P. J. Clarey was in 1958, except that the
Liberal vote was slightly lower and the
D.L.P. slightly higher. Counting of an
additional 2000 votes on Sunday left the
positions relatively unchanged, with
Beaton 1121 in arrears in a total tally of
40,331 votes.
Receiving only 13.5 per cent, of the
D.L.P. preferences, Clarey overcame a
bigger primary deficit than that in 1958
to win by 266. Unless postal and absen-
tee votes follow a very different trend
from those so far counted Beaton should
retain Bendigo for the A.L.P.
Monday’s figures in Bendigo were:
N. L. Beaton (A.L.P.), 19,444; H. W.
Snell (Lib.), 14,842; F. W. Drechsler
(D.L.P.), 5723.
The Balaclava progress score stands:
R. H. Whittorn (Lib.), 17,636; G. L.
Smith (A.L.P.), 9429; J. T. Ryan
(D.L.P.), 4615 ; J. Murray (Repub.), 849.

Moscow seems to have put the hard
word on Peking, which signed the agree-
ment favoring Khrushchev’s plans for
coexistence to destroy the West and got
Mrs. Sun Yat Sen to announce that it
was “plainly a lie” to suggest that Mao
held any other view. Not last week,
anyhow.

At the Democratic Convention at Los
Angeles Senator John Kennedy crowned
his string of successes in State primaries
by winning the Democratic nomination
for President on the first poll. In accor-
dance with custom the convention then
made his nomination unanimous and
Senator Johnson and other rivals pledged
their support. Next day Kennedy indi-
cated that he wanted Johnson as his
running-mate for the Vice-Presidency
and the convention endorsed his choice.
Attention now switches to the Repub-
lican Convention to open in Chicago
next Monday. Vice-President Richard
Nixon seems to have his party’s nomina-
tion in the bag unless the supporters of
Nelson Rockefeller, Governor of New
York, have more success than they prob-
ably expect in their last-minute cam-
paign to “draft” him.
The P.M.’s first letter to Khrushchev —
in reply to one about the break-up of the
Disarmament Conference which the Com-
munists sabotaged—was marked by an
unusual old-world courtesy equal to that
of Dr. Evatt’s letter to Molotov. In
Canada Prime Minister Diefenbaker
wasn’t so polite. He. told Khrushchev
clearly that he was only trying to divide
the Western Allies.

There’ll be four starters next Saturday
in the Mulgrave by-election for the
Queensland Assembly. To the names
previously announced —R. A. Arm-
strong (C.P.) and S. S. Scoines (A.L.P.)
—have been added C. B. English, a
former holder of the seat who is now a
member of the Q.L.P., and J. N. Hesp,
who is standing as an Independent.
English won the seat in 1953 and 1956,
but lost it in 1957 to R. H. Watson
(C.P.). On Watson’s death C. F. Words-
worth retained it for the Country party.
His death just before the recent general
election made the by-election necessary.

The Congo crisis will make poor read-
ing for Arthur Calwell and Man Friday
Whitlam on their trip to New Guinea.
They should send a telegram of sym-
pathy to fellow-Socialists in Brussels who
were foremost in pushing the Belgian
Government into giving the Congo its
freedom without proper preparation.
• •
All the Democrats who stood for
Presidential selection at Los Angeles
were millionaires or near-millionaires.
Kennedy, senior, made his money (a)
partly out of playing the Stock Exchange
in the forward-selling racket ; (b) partly
by acquiring large stocks of medicinal
Haig and Haig and rum with canny
prescience before Prohibition was
repealed.

The Budget, on present intentions, will
be introduced on August 16, but with the
deficit down through tax buoyancy
there is .no talk of tax - reduction
There scarcely can be any while
dangers of inflation continue in a
world of booming land-prices and high
interest, which affects the flow of Gov-
ernment borrowing. The only rumor of
benefit is that pensioners will get a
bit more. If the Government has any
presents for electors it will be hoarding
them for next year—with a general
election to follow.

Hugh Gaitskell hauled-up the white
flag to the Leftists and agreed to con-
tinue to advocate full nationalisation as
part of the party’s platform. Judg-
ing by the fight he has put up to alter
the clause, he doesn’t believe in it, blit
the leadership comes before conviction,
Especially as he has an issue like defenct
to fight on and divide his enemies a!
next October’s conference, which would
certainly have defeated him on
Socialism.

Th 6 Japanese have all gone home
quietly, “ashamed” after their orgy of
snake-dancing, and the only violence
came from a snake-dancer opponent who_
stabbed former Prime Minister Kishi in
the leg to protest against his treatment of
President Eisenhower after he had held
a garden-party to congratulate his succes-
sor, Hayato Ikeda. Kishi was later
reported “a little tired but in high spirits,
The dissolution of the Diet and an elec-
tion campaign will come at a dangerous
time in international affairs if the)
follow imrpediately.
"CHEAP! THAT'S ADDING INSULT TO INJURY."


TT is evident from his speeches that
1 Khrushchev has discarded the “I Like
jke” button he was wearing after the
fort David get-together for one reading
“Hertz to Nixon.”

The latest essay in democracy by the
Indonesian Government has been to
issue regulations taking control of all
political parties and banning all new
ones. That's a democratic device some
A.L.P- leaders would dearly like to use
in their scrap with the D.L.P.

Slowly but surely saner liquor laws
are spreading throughout the States.
South Australia is the latest to consider
reforms, and when Parliament resumes
it is expected that a bill will be intro-
duced to permit liquor to be sold for
consumption with meals until 10 p.m.;
also to permit the issue of limited licences
to tourist-chalets in areas remote from
hotels. But there’s no talk of extending
hotel-hours. Six-o’clock closing is still
the rule in South Australia, as in Vic-
toria.
• •
fieut.-General Gordon Bennett, after
a few days in Tokyo, has assured himself
that “Opposition to the new U.S.-Japan
Security Treaty is not a Communist-
inspired plot but a reflection of resurgent
Japanese nationalism.” The A.L.P. ought
to have a job for him. He seems to be-
the only man likely to be able to decide
positively whether the Communists and
Labor candidates really ran a unity-
ticket for the Victorian watersiders’
elections.
• •
The Ironworkers Association has come
out strongly against the A.C.T.U. levy
imposed to cover the costs of a visit to
Australia of trade-union delegates from
Soviet Russia and Communist China.
Secretary Short says his union objects
because “we do not recognise as genuine
Labor organisations the so-called unions
behind the Iron Curtain.”' He also claims
that when the A.C.T.U. congress decided
last year to invite delegations from other
countries no mention was made of im-
posing a levy although the intention must
have been known to president Albert
Monk.
The Ironworkers will also boycott
receptions arranged for the visiting Red
unionists.

“Stromlo”: The smug, self-satisfied
look of the “M.P. salaries” blind mouse
ln Scorfield’s cartoon (B. 13/7/’6O)
Prompts a thought. Will the coming
Budget (or the following one) contain
an Y Intimation of the Government’s pro-
posals (in consultation with the Oppo-
*ufion) for the payment of members of
Joe- next Federal Parliament? And, as
he Y say in Parliamentary questions, if
So , what? And if not, why not?

N : B e f° re the year ends, the
■S.W. Department of Main Roads will
ave completed a new Gwydir Highway
from Glen Innes to Grafton at a cost
of £2j million. The old highway, travers-
ing country to the south, will be replaced
but not abandoned. It has sharp descents
and dangerous hairpin-bends, and in
some parts the road, blasted-out of the
rock face, is hardly wide enough to carry
two cars abreast. Near Dalmorton large
vehicles can't use it because of a short
tunnel only 10ft. high and 14ft. across.
Much of the trade between the inland and
the coast goes by rail to Maitland and
then back up the North Coast line ; but
the new route will avoid this roundabout
method and save travelling time. The
new highway goes through excellent
stands of timber on the Gibraltar Range,
where even cedar trees —now almost
museum pieces have been found.
Although it is seven miles longer—loB
miles now —than the existing highway,
travelling time between Glen Innes and
Grafton will be about two hours less.
Grades are infinitely better, and in most
places the surface has been designed for
fast traffic.

VIfHEN the Red - dominated Seamen’s
* Union put a black ban on the Dutch
aircraft-carrier Karel Doormanj thereby
denying it the assistance of tugs, the
vessel used power from the propellers of
four Grumman Avenger aircraft lashed
to its flight-deck to assist it to berth at
Fremantle wharf.
A Dutch Foreign Office spokesman is
reported as saying he found the ban
“inexplicable.” It's easily enough ex-
plained. Australia regards the Nether-
lands as a good friend, but Moscow sides
with Indonesia in the dispute over West
New Guinea and to the “Australian”
Seamen’s Union Moscow’s wish is a
command. If the carrier had been the
Karolsky Dormavitch the loyal fellows
would have been crawling on their bellies
for the honor of handling its tow-lines.

Peter Ffrench Loughlin, who was
accidentally killed in a car accident last
week, was Minister for Lands in the
Storey and Dooley Labor Governments
of 1920-22 and was Deputy-Leader to
Lang in 1925 when he challenged the
Big Fella for the leadership and missed
by only one vote, his supporters includ-
ing J. J. McGirr, J. J. Cahill and H. V.
Evatt. In 1926 he resigned from the
A.L.P., unsuccessfully contested Coota-
mundra (his old seat) as an Independent
and in 1932 won Goulburn for the
U.A.P. This time he stayed in Parlia-
ment only three years, was defeated in
1935 and retired from politics, farming
in the central west until a few years ago.
He was 79 at the finish.
• •
“Newsawk”: Arthur Calwell has been
stunning the political reporters by reply-
ing, to questions he doesn’t want to
answer, “What do you think of Arch-
bishop Mannix?” It was rathe/ a dif-
ferent matter when he was Minister for
Information and called a press con-
ference at which the political correspon-
dents were dumbfounded to be informed
that he was displeased with the Papacy
for the election to the College of Cardi-
nals of Archbishop Gilroy and not
Archbishop Mannix. Perhaps he has
revised his opinion of the Vatican as a
judge of cardinal quality.
• e
A cattle-station for aborigines is to
be established in the Musgrave Ranges,
S.A. Minister for Works Pearson an-
nounced last week. The only white man
on the property will be the superin-
tendent, and the station will serve the
dual purpose of providing employment
for aborigines and a training-ground for
those who will later seek jobs on other
stations.
• •
“C.S.”: About 300 Victorians, chiefly
Melburnians, have received show-cause
summonses relating to piffling war-time
offences. A typical instance is a
fashionable photographer who was fined
£1 in 1945 for travelling on a suburban
train without paying the penny for his
soldier’s-concession ticket. The work of
delivering those 300 summonses was con-
siderable, which explains, perhaps, why
there are so few traffic-policemen on Vic-
torian roads and why Police Commis-
sioner Porter has been asking the
Government for more men.
• •
“Otaki”: N.Z. Labor, in its last
session before the general election in
November, has received a large dose of
the cane from the Auditor-General, who
doesn’t like the practice of altering taxa-
tion without the sanction of Parliament,
and who views with a jaundiced eye the
state of the kitty which doesn't seem to
hold enough dough to meet proposed
expenditure. The real tickler, however,
is the Nelson-Blenheim railway, which
was initiated with some pomp and
ceremony by Prime Minister Nash when
he pressed a button which permitted the
first of a line of trucks to deposit spoil
on the mud-flat that is to be the site of
the railway-station. The A.-G. has
pointed out that you just can’t build rail-
• ways without the authority of a special
Act. But quick thinking has got-around
that. The Commissioner of Works has
replied that causeways, rock-bunds and
reclamation being carried - out are not
construction, but merely preliminary in-
vestigation, for which work there was
authority.
• •
CJydney City Council flats to be built
at Glebe, Pyrmont and Camperdown
are to be allocated on a points system.
The Town Clerk has suggested that
“points be allotted on the basis of inade-
quate housing-space, inadequate kitchen-
facilities, inadequate toilet-facilities, in-
security of tenure, marriage-status, if the
applicant is a city resident and if an
employee of the council.”
There’s a strange omission here.
Nothing is said about bonus points “if
the applicant is a relative of an aider-
man.” But perhaps that's a point that
doesn’t call for mention.

Off to the Sudan as a one-man contin-
gent, Donald Drover has been appointed
head of the Department of Chemistry at
the Khartoum University. Born at Nar-
randera (N.S.W.), where his father runs
the “Argus,” Dr. Drover is now senior
lecturer in Soil Science at the Westralian
University’s Institute of Agriculture. He
graduated B.Sc. with honors from Sydney
University and gained his Ph.D. with a
thesis on the organic and nitrogen con-
tent of the coarse soils of the W.A.
wheatbelt. Granted 12 months study-
leave in 1956, he put it in at the Macaulay

“8.H.”: Jacob Vouza, a Melanesian
from Roroni, on Guadalcanal, was
somewhere about 16 years old when he
joined the Armed Native Constabulary
GUADALCANAL
in 1916 as a police-boy. He was a
sergeant-major when he retired from the
force in 1937 and received the George
VI Coronation Medal to mark the end
of his public service.
When War II brought the Japs to the
islands, Vouza was enlisted in the Solo-
mon Islands Defence Force as a sergeant-
major, and was employed as a scout,
working behind the enemy lines. On one
occasion he was captured by the enemy,
interrogated and tortured, then tied to a
tree and used for bayonet-practice. He
was left for dead, but managed to get
free of his bonds and survived to return
to duty. He was awarded the George
Medal by the British, and both the
Legion of Merit and Silver Star for Gal-
lantry by the U.S.
After the war Vouza returned to his
village and became District Headman
of Tasimboko. He was given a com-
mission as honorary sub-inspector in
the Solomon Islands Police Force, which
enabled him to wear the uniform on
State occasions. The highest of these
occasions occurred in 1953, when he
went to London to attend the Corona-
tion of Queen Elizabeth as official repre-
sentative of the Solomon Islands people,
Home again, he became a Native Mem-
ber of the Government Advisory Coun-
cil, and succeeded Sir Robert Stanley as
president of the Guadalcanal Council.

Ronald Wilfrid Turnbull, who is chair-
man of a new telephone-network com-
mittee in Victoria and who has become
known as “Elsa’s Father,” shares with
Roy Thomas Simmonds, a Health De-
partment consultant serologist, the 1959
Professional Officers’ Association award
of merit.
The award, now in its fifth year, is
made among Federal public servants and
Federal instrumentalities on the recom-
mendation of an eminent scientist taking
into account service to the community,
advancement of science, originality, re-
sourcefulness, and organisational and
administrative ability. Previous * winners
have been P. G. Law (Antarctic), R. V.
Lewis, Ismay Brereton (education of the
deaf), H. M. Treloar, K. A. Metcalfe
and R. G. Wright (xerography).
Ronald Turnbull’s committee is
charged with the master plan for the
overall development of the Australian
telephone-network, and his committee’s
“Elsa” in Melbourne was an important
first success. “Elsa” (Extended Local
Service Area) permits subscribers to
make calls over longer distances at local
rates.
Roy Simmonds, an authority on blood-
genetics, received the award for his con-
tribution to the study of blood (haemat-
ology), and his survey-work in the Pacific,
in the opinion of Professor Oliphant
(who recommended the officers for the
awards), “undoubtedly led to a great en-
richment of knowledge of blood-group-
ings in the area.”
Taking on what is a new appointment
for the N.S.W. North Coast —designated
by the Department of Agriculture as
Livestock Officer, Ddiry Cattle, Coff's
Harbor —B. D. Heptonstall has been in
charge of the A.I.S. stud at Grafton
Experiment Farm for the last five years.
A graduate of Hawkesbury Agricultural
College, he is to concentrate on exten-
sion-work in herd-improvement in the
North Coast area as far south as Dorrigo
and Macksville.

“Lai”: Unquestionably the most
harassed men in Victoria just now (not
that they take much notice of it) are
the ones known as the “top six” —the V.FL
umpires Harry Beitzel, Jack Irving, Couj*
Mance, Harry Hodgson, Bob' Nunn and Frant
Schwab. Veteran of the “six” is Harry
Beitzel; Harry has umpired 150 senior games-
including the 1955 grand-final. Bob Nunn
umpired 81 matches, including the 1956 a®
1958 reserve-grade finals. Frank Schwab, a
27, is the youngest, but third in seniority-
his umpiring of 69 League games (his first al
23) has included the 1959 reserve-grade grant*'
final and recently the Victorian v.
match in Hobart (won by Tassie). Jack Irvin?;
umpired Association footy for many ye arS
before transferring to the League; as the top'

“M.T.P.” - Under a new policy here
j n Fiji higher positions are now being
filled by appointment of locals, and two
Fiji-born Indians have just been appointed
to Government posts. Kamal Chand
Gajadhar, new Crown Counsel, was
educated in Fiji and at the Victoria
University College, Wellington (N.Z.),
admitted a barrister and solicitor of the
Supreme Court of New Zealand and,
when he returned to Fiji in- 1951, to the
Fiji Bar. Chananand Mishra, new
Education Officer, was educated at Wai-
ruku Indian School, D.A.V. College,
Dehra Dun. (India), and Allahabad Uni-
versity. He trained as a teacher at
Auckland Training College, taught in
Fiji, then went to Britain for the Associ-
ateship Course at London University.
Promoted Assistant for Indian Education
in 1951, he resigned from Government
service in 1955 and went to London,
where he was called to the Bar in 1957.
Since 1958 he has worked as a solicitor

John G. Glenn was an original of the
2/48th Battalion and served with the
unit to its disbandment at Tarakan in
1945, so he’s well fitted to write Tobruk
to Tarakan, The Story of a Fighting
Unit, recently published history of the
2/48th. The battalion—said to be the
highest-decorated unit in the 2nd A.LF.
—included such names as Diver Derrick
and Sgt. W. H. Kibby. Born at Pt. Pirie
(S.A.), Glenn, who rose to become major
in charge of Intelligence in the unit and
is now a schoolteacher at Port Adelaide,
modestly fails to mention that he was
among the members of the 2/48th to be
mentioned in dispatches.

“Ailsey”: “Joanne’s” comment that
few colliery - clerks become mine-
managers (B. 25/5/’6O) is no doubt
correct, but I know one colliery-clerk
who managed to do pretty well in rather
different fields T. R. Williams, who
became secretary of Sydney University

has just retired. Tommy, as everyone
calls him, was a clerk at Stanford
Merthyr colliery, Kurri Kurri (N.S.W.),

“Iconoclast”: A couple of “old boys”
of Sydney’s Fort Street High have cer-
tainly gone a long way to confirm Lord
Nuffield’s belief that best candidates for
appointment to university Chairs in the
U.K. are Commonwealth scholars who
have made good in their own countries
and continued to do well overseas.
Lawrence Stanley Goddard, who
graduated in science in 1939, won a
travelling scholarship to Cambridge,
which he took-up after the outbreak of
War 11. After two years at Cambridge
he spent the rest of the war working
for the British Army, then returned to
the Uni. to complete his doctorate. He
became senior lecturer in mathematics
at the Universities of St. Andrews and
Aberdeen, joined 1.C.1. in England, and
last year was chosen for one of the two
professorships of mathematics in the
University of Tasmania.
Owen Martin Phillips, the other “can-
didate,” graduated in science at Sydney
Uni. in 1952, won an 1.C.1. travelling
scholarship which took him to Cam-
bridge also, and, after taking his doc-
torate, became a lecturer in mathematics
there and a Fellow of Clare College.
Subsequently he went to America, where
he was Assistant Professor and later
. Associate Professor of Mathematics at
the Johns Hopkins University. Now he’s
been appointed Director of Applied
Mathematics and Director of Oceano-
graphy in the new Churchill College at
Cambridge.

Bathurst and at the experiment-farms at
Wagga and Yanco, and then for a time
at the Griffith viticultural nursery. The
help he gave in the successful campaign
against bunchytop in bananas hasn’t been

Sketched above, Captain John Malet
Armstrong, R.A.N. (retd.), is secretary
of the Australian Outward Bound
Foundation and works from an office in
Martin Place, Sydney. Since a lot of
the training at the Outward Bound school
is based on seamanship, he gives just the
right touch of naval trimness to the
organisation, backed by the experience
of 44 years on pay in the R.A.N.
Born in Sydney and schooled at Sydney
Grammar, All Saints’ (Bathurst) and the
LINGAYEN
R.A.N. College, Jervis Bay, he was a
midshipman in 1918, commissioned in
1921, and in War II was in command
of H.M.A.S. Australia, winning the
D.S.O. and U.S. Navy Cross while
serving as part of the American task
force at Lingayen, where five Jap suicide-
planes landed on the Australia’s deck in
the four days of the battle. After the
war he was inter-service technical-officer
on the staff of the Australian Defence
Representative in London and was later
Director of Ordnance and Underwater
Weapons, retiring in 1958.

Into the Silence:
In Sydney, at 88, Francis Xavier Gsell, R.C.
Bishop of Darwin from 1938 till his retirement
in 1948. In 1911 he founded a mission for
aborigines on Bathurst Island, which he con-
ducted for 27 years. His work there brought
him the 0.8. E. and the French Legion of
Honor.
At Ferntree Gully (Vic.), at 74, Sir George
Knox, a member of the Victorian Parliament
for 33 years, and Speaker from 1942 to 1947.
In Sydney, at 71, F. W. Duesbury,
accountant and company-director, for 20 years
a member of the AJ.C. committee.
In Sydney, at 66, Reginald Stuart Maxwell,
M.C., D.F.C. and Bar, A.F.C., commander,
R.N., and group-captain, R.A.F. An English-
man by birth, he was a fighter-pilot in War f

on the first Cairo-Cape flight. In War 11, as
group-captain at Baghdad, he took part in
the evacuation of Europeans from Afghanistan,
then transferred to the Fleet Air Arm and was
for a time stationed at Nowra.
At Kalgoorlie, Rudolph’ John Agnew, a

“Interesting display , isn't it?"
TN the bar of the pub at Bedourie, in
the Channel Country of far-west
high up on the wallplate
hangs a coiled kangaroo-hide stock-
whip. Joe Condon, who runs the pub-
cwm-store-cwra-post-office, told me:
“Belonged to one of Kidman’s gun
stockmen, Jack Hall. He was killed
when his horse fell over a mickey on
a bronco-camp over on the Mulligan.
They buried him in the sandhills out
there and his mates brought his stock-
whip in and had it hung in the bar
as a monument to a fine stockman and
fearless horseman. ‘Let a better man
than Hall take the whip down,’ is what
the ringers say. It was hung there
half a century ago, when the Gaffney
family were the licensees. Len Gaffney
has the pub at Birdsville now.”-

“Joanne’’: Officials of Darwin (N.T.)
Dental Clinic were nonplussed when they
found most of a little man’s teeth loose,
yet there was no sign of any blow or
marks of violence. The patient ex-,
plained: he was a jockey, and when
riding work one cold morning he put
the reins in his mouth, his hands in his
armpits—and the horse nodded.

“J.J.A.”: Part of the T instructions in
a mystery car-tour: “No. of tanks on
Windmill stand.” The organiser had
looked from the road across the paddock
and counted one. But when the cards
came in he was intrigued. Most of the
drivers, city chaps, had gone over,
climbed the stand and reported that the
no. of the tank was 26g., that gauge-
number, of course, being printed on
almost every sheet of iron composite
the tank.

THE MYTH AND THE
MOUNTAIN
[Related by Eustan Williams, of the
Githavul tribe.]
Look at that mountain Jalgumbun
standing up.
Look how it goes straight up on all its
sides.
No man can climb that mountain. Look
at its head,
look now through the mist, covered with
trees.
I worked with Phinny McPherson the
surveyor
right along this range, and when we come
to Jalgumbun, he says to me, “Now
Eustan,
let me see them steps you say are cut
out in this mountain.” And as I pointed
out -*
them steps, he stood there, writing down
the story of the mountain that l told him.
That mountain Jalgumbun was once a
tree.
A man went after honey in that tree.
He climbed up with the vine-rope round
himself
and round the tree. And as he climbed
he cut
out foot-holds with his stone-axe. And
his wives
were waiting in the forest down below.
“Where are you ?” they called out. And
he called back,
“I'm chopping out the honey.” Then
these women
wanted to come up closer,'but again
the man sang out, “No', wait there where
you are.”
and went on chopping, chopping out the
honey.
At last he called out, “Here it is,” and
rolled
the piece of wood with all the honey in it
down to the butt and big roots of the tree.
They sat down in their camp and ate the
honey,
and travelled then away out on the range.
That night there was no moon. The
women looked
out into the night and spoke together,
“Oh, look, what is that ‘something’ over
there ?
“Oh, it is like a shadow . . . See, that
‘something’
over there is blocking out the stars.”
And in the morning when they woke and
looked
out, from the ranges where they’d
camped, they saw
the mountain that was never there before,
Jalgumbun standing up against the sky.
r
Well, there’s a tree called Jalgumbun that
grows
here in the ranges. It has a real soft skin.
The fellers from the mill at Urbenville
come with their tractors, axes and their
gear,
and fell and lop them trees and drag them
now
out from the ranges of their native home.

sketches on “Christmas in Australia” for
the “Illustrated London News” in the
1870’s, one of which depicted an abo.
dressed in top-hat and blanket near a
group of singing diggers. But top-hats
for bushmen —no, that different!
Miles Franklin relates, in Joseph Furphy,
that when illustrations for Such Is Life
were being considered Furphy wrote to
his friend William Cathels with instruc-
tions to see that artist Alf Vincent
“doesn’t draw bushmen in bell-toppers.”
That was early in 1902. Furphy may
have had in mind the Picturesque Atlas
of Australasia, published in 1886, in
which a fine full-page engraving depicted
Hargraves discovering gold in Australia,
wearing a top-hat and holding a trowel
in his right hand. That, however, arose
from an artistic formula of the time —the
artist wished to depict Hargraves in the
status of a gentle-
man, and for this
the top-hat was the
rule de rigueur. —

“Sam Square”: Australian record for
a family hotel must surely go to the
Sheahans, of Jugiong (N.S.W.). The first
Sheahan started the Jugiong Hotel, an
important stop in the old coaching-days,
more than 115 years ago. On his death
the licence was transferred to Mrs. M. A.
Sheahan, who held it more than 30 years.
When she died in 1938 James Sheahan
was Mine Host until 1947, when his
sister, Miss Bridget Sheahan, took-over.
When Miss Sheahan died seven years ago
the hotel passed in turn to her sister,
Mrs. Margaret Holm, the present owner.
The N.S.W. Minister for Health, W. F.
(“Billy”) Sheahan, is a grandson of the
original owner.

“Crow Eater”: The gold sovereign,
with its representation of England’s
patron saint slaying the dragon, used
to figure in various roles other than
as currency. Up in Thursday Island in
the old days champagne-drinking pearlers
tossing sovereigns about might wear
coat-buttons made from the half-
sovereign, and jewellers used to shape
them with a fine saw into cut-out designs
to be worn as pendants. In my younger
days photographers toned their prints in
a dish of chloride-of-gold, composed of
a number of golden sovereigns thrown
"I’m just looking!”
into acid, where they disso 1 v e d
away. Sovereigns were, of course, the
regular thing for presentation to depart-
ing citizens at a farewell-gathering, and
I still possess among my collection of
odds-and-ends a silver, spring-fitted case
that was filled to capacity when first
handed to me, and another little leather
container that housed a very respectable
number of the best when-presented as
“a slight token of esteem.” Somehow a
purse of sovereigns to speed the parting
guest seemed much more romantic than
a wallet of notes, but nowadays the
yellow-boys are museum-exhibits among
other things that existed “before World
War I.”

“Fuzzy Wuzzy”: Has the sudden
upward surge in New Guinea’s tea-
exports to Australia had anything to
do with the recent overdue reduction
of retail tea-prices by 3d. or 4d. a
pound? The development may be an
important one for Australia—although
the issue is complicated by the fact that
we want Ceylon, India and Indonesia
to continue to buy our flour and other
products, and consequently tea-imports
from those countries are fostered. ]„
the first three months of 1960 those
countries, as usual, had by far the
greatest* share of the market (Ceylon
sent more than 11,700,0001 b. out of the
total of 16,220,0001 b. imported in the
period), but New Guinea came fourth
on the list of suppliers, with 354,2161 b„
valued at £86,222 —ahead of both main-
land China and Kenya.

“Gravelsnatcher”: Boulger may' have
recommended jamwood to London
cabinetmakers (B. 22 /6 / ’6O), but I’ll
take a shade of odds few of them used
it, and I doubt if there's a timberman
in Perth who has handled it except for
such items as book-ends and inkwell-
stands. It just isn’t a timber-tree-
grows in dry country, runs trees to the
ton instead of tons to the tree, and
its hardness would make it unprofit-
able to both axeman and miller. I’ve
cleared jam-country, and I’ve specked
through it seeking fence-posts; and,
while jt isn’t the hardest timber in
W.A., it’s several times harder than
jarrah, which timbermen rightly class
as a hardwood. From the axeman’s
point of view a just comparison might
be between dry jarrah and green jam,
There may be a big proportion of
fiddleback in it, but who would know?
Like many other Westralian timbers
which are beautiful by any standards,
except in isolated areas it wouldn’t run

“Lonin”: The skipper and engineer of
the trading-boat, here on the Papuan
coast, had been at loggerheads for
months, each charging the other with
incompetence. Finally they agreed to
swap jobs. Three hours later, perspiring
from the heat in the engineroom, the
skipper came on deck and admitted,
“You win! I can’t get the engine to
turn over at all.” “That’s all right,” said
the acting-skip. “It doesn't matter-1
ran her up on the reef over two hours
ago! ”

“R. Ray”: Until his death at 87 my
father always wore a grey flannel; never
a singlet, either cotton or woollen; the
theory being that singlets didn’t absorb
any perspiration, and so left the body
cold and a prey to any wandering germ.
He always instanced the fact that the
Scottish shepherds could sleep-out in the
damp and cold of the Highlands
in their woollen plaids, without ill effect.
Blacksmiths always wore navy - blue
(nearly black) flannel, and the gold'
miners also wore them. I thought that
the cult of the bare torso, both at work
and at play, and the almost universal
use of both woollen and cotton single


ve r the past 40 years, had finally settled
the o id flannel-theory, which, strangely
; U oh, was never applied to women
o n d babies. So I was intrigued recently
when passing a road-gang on the Pacific
Highway a few miles from the Queens-
•and border to see three of the men
wearing dark-grey flannels. These men
were apparently in their late 50’s. The
younger chaps wore cotton singlets and
Shorts; yet both lots looked healthy
enough.

“Barone”: Neatest bit of horse-timing.
I’ ve come across has happened on a
country course. The owner of a smart
galloper gave him a pre-dawn run to
dodge touts and urgers. The jockey
carried a stop - watch and timed the
gallop, as the starting-point could not be
seen from the finishing-post. The gallop
was a sizzler, and plans were made for
a big win at the following Saturday’s
races. But when the owner went to place
his money he found the odds surprisingly
short. He sleuthed-out the two chaps
whose cash had forced the long price
down, and wanted to know if they had
greased someone’s palm. “Not at all,”
one of them said. “We got wind of the
trial, so Joe hid near the starting-point
and started his stop-watch when the
horse jumped. 1 was near the judge’s box
and started mine at the finish. We then
joined-up and stopped our watches at
the same moment. The difference in the
times was the time of the gallop, and you
know how good that was! ”

“Murlonga”: In Charters Towers
(N.Q.) 30 or 40 years ago the aborigines
from stations in the district had an old
pub with no beer practically reserved for
them when they came to town for their
holidays—particularly at Christmas-time
and the annual races. The boys, most
of them mission-trained, were able to
read and write, and tell the time by their
wristlet-watches. But some of the old
streaks remained: they couldn’t resist
flashy attire, potent scents, and big jing-
ling spurs. Grog being denied them,
they did the next-best thing and went on
a lolly-water spree. The gins went in
for gaudy parasols, to protect skin im-
mune to sunburn, and loved stockings
that rivalled the rainbow for color —to
see a short-skirted gin with pipe-thin
flamingo-red legs was alone worth a
tnp to town. Especially, though, they
loved lipstick, with a preference for
colors that just wouldn’t harmonise with
their skins. Altogether they did enjoy
their trip to town, to mingle with their
kinfolk, and to touch the edge of a
civilisation they couldn’t grasp.

103,678 BIRDS BANDED
as well as scientific benefits
follow the world-wide practice of
md-banding (attaching a light, numbered
and to a bird’s leg to permit subsequent
m entiflcation of a captured or dead bird).
In Australian territory catching the
JNs ranges from the Antarctic to the
Barrier Reef, from
Westralia’s Rottnest
Island to the haunts
of the wandering-
albatross off Mala-
bar, near Sydney.
The birds are
mostly banded by
amateurs, advised
by C.5.1.R.0. ex-
perts. Five years
of the Australian
scheme to the end
of June, 1959, re-
sulted in a total of
103,678 birds being
banded.
The work is occa-
sionally rewarded
here, as elsewhere,
by spectacular “re-
coveries” of banded
birds that have
flown immense dis-
tances or on unsus-
pected routes. These
make the news-
paper-headlines, but
the enduring value
of the scheme is in
the tracing and re-
cording of a steady
pattern of conserva-
tion, breeding, feed-
ing and migratory
habits. Much of this pattern is of im-
portance to farmers, fishermen and
others, including medical scientists.
The fifth annual report of the Aus-
tralian scheme, by Flitchcock and Car-
rick, shows that in 1958-9 almost 37,000
birds of 216 species were banded, and
there were 6335 recoveries of 99 species.
Nearly 15,000 of the bandings were of
silver gulls, including more than 14,000
chicks.
Spur-winged plovers and six species
of waders are being banded, as well as
five species introduced into Australia
with varying economic effects house-
sparrows, starlings, goldfinches, red-
whiskered bulbuls and blackbirds.
W. B. Hitchcock and R. Carrick, of
the Wildlife Section of C.5.1.R.0., say
that the six-figure total of birds banded
in five years (representing 253 species),
the annual total of more than 35,000
and the recovery-rate of 10.3 per cent,
can be regarded as satisfactory “at this
stage.” They say the scheme is beginning
to play a part in the world-wide survey
of bird-movements, and they mention
some comparative figures of banding:
New Zealand, 1950-7, 33,000 birds of
50 species; South Africa, 1948-56,
88,500 birds of 364 species; Britain,
1909-58, 2,014,467 birds ; Canada, 1920-
58, 1,318,903 birds; United States, more
than 700,000 in 1956 ; and Russia, 1925-
54, 678,550 birds of 416 species.
In addition to providing bands and
service for scientific investigations of
birds of agricultural and medical import-
ance —including ducks, the pied-goose,
ibises and waders and the muttonbird —
the scheme has begun to collect informa-
tion on the movements and habits of other
species considered pests of crops, such
as roseilas, silvereyes, the starling, finches
"Someone’s been here before us!”
and the house-sparrow ; and on p
of stock, including the raven ;
wedgetailed-eagle. The suspected
of disease, by the way, include
birds and waders,
It is felt by C.5.1.R.0. that
wide scope for increased activity in t
field, especially in areas of ex
agricultural development and set
where seed-eating finches and coi
fruit-eating parrots and other pest peacs
are abundant or potentially so.
It is considered that much more :
formation is needed on the movements
of ravens and hawks. Data on the
seasonal movements throughout Aus-
tralia of foreign waders, which have been
shown to carry dengue-fever, is scanty,
and the relationship of water-birds to
Murray Valley encephalitis requires
better knowledge of their movements,
As Carrick and Hitchcock say, basic
information of this kind accumulates
slowly, and a main aim of the scheme
must be to have that knowledge avail-
able when economic developments or
researches in other fields reveal a new
importance for any species or group of
birds.
Most banding, inevitably, has been near
the main centres of population, with the
exception of that done in Antarctica and
with some sea-birds and inland ducks and
ibises.
The C.5.1.R.0. is hopeful that publi-
Cl ty for the scheme will increase the
volume and extend the geographical
range of its results. So far, the short-
tailed shearwater (the muttonbird) is still
the only species banded by the scheme
which has been recovered north of the
Equator, and the giant-petrel is the only
one reported from the Pacific islands,

INFORMATION IN ACCOUNTS
More information in com-
pany accounts should
benefit everyone. That is a
summing-up of the opinions
expressed by A. H. Urquhart,
chairman of Sydney Stock
Exchange, when addressing the
Australian Institute of Manage-
ment on the occasion of the
presentation of balance-sheet
awards on June 27.
“Over the years,” said Mr.
Urquhart, “many of the listing
requirements of the Stock
Exchange have been written
into various Companies Acts
and are still being dealt with
in this fashion. The new
Companies Act in Victoria
includes practically all the
listed requirements of the
Associated Stock Exchanges,
and we understand this Act is
to be the basis of similar legis-
lation throughout the Com-
monwealth.
“O u r requirements for
interim reports are not included
in the Victorian Act, but it
is our hope that the Govern-
ment of N.S.W. may well
improve on the Victorian Act
in its forthcoming bill.
“The importance of interim
reports from companies is
growing with the increasing
pace of modern business life,
and many companies do, in
fact, acknowledge the necessity
of providing their shareholders
with a half-yearly picture of
the progress of their enterprise.
Our standard interim dividend
and report announcement asks
that a company should indi-
cate ( a ) the relationship of
volume of sales (or revenue)
compared with volume of sales
(or revenue) in the correspond-
ing period of the previous
year ; ( b ) a statement of any
unusual factors affecting the
earning-capacity of the com-
pany ; and (c) in the case of
mining companies, a factual
statement of production and
development.
“This we believe to be a
desirable minimum.
“The Stock Exchange listing
requirements, of course, give
companies the option of pro-
viding consolidated accounts
or of detailing their sub-
sidiaries’ accounts. Too often,
I feel, directors lean to con-
solidated accounts when, in
these days of diversification,
companies which are often
engaged in two or more com-
pletely different activities
cannot satisfactorily inform
their shareholders of the
profitability or otherwise of
their varied operations by this
means. -
“The importance of a clear
indication of taxation provi-
sion and turnover can hardly
be emphasised sufficiently. It
is hardly possible to complete
a worth-while analysis of a
company’s position without
this data.
“It is often argued that
competitive reasons forbid the
disclosure of these figures, as
they could, he used by a com-
petitor to the detriment of the
company concerned and,
therefore, its shareholders.
“An efficient company surely
need not fear its competitors,
knowing that it has a large
and increasing share of the
market. But it is essential that
the directors of the inefficient
competitor (if such a company
exists in Australia today)
should allow their proprietors
—the shareholders—to have
some say in ensuring that the
inefficiency is eradicated.
“It is difficult to see how
an incentive to efficient
management can be against
shareholders’ interests. Indeed,
if this were true, it is strange
that in one very competitive
industry dominated by large
overseas companies, two
Australian - owned concerns
are noted for the high quality
of their published accounts,
and for their unqualified
success.
“On the other hand, it is
unfortunate that some of the
most secretive company
accounts are produced by
companies which, competi-
tively, are almost impregnable
“I do not think that the plea
of competition can be substan-
tiated in any but a few excep.
tional cases as a genuine reason
why turnover figures should
not be divulged.
“A banker' demands these
figures because the three
primary aspects of his analysis
of a company’s financial posi-
tion depend on: (1) the
trading position ; (2) the
financial position ; (3) profits
and capital. The trading posi-
tion, as we are all aware, is
perhaps the most sensitive
indicator of all in this analysis,
It is indeed essential in the
determination of this position
to look at the various relation-
ships of turnover to gross
profit, debtors, shareholders’
funds, and the rate of stock
turnover. However, this is
not the place to go into details
of balance-sheet analysis, and
therefore I must leave this
fascinating field to the security-
analyst and banker.
• “Political expediency has
sometimes been advanced as
a reason for the far from
adequate disclosure of a com-
pany’s activities, but this is a
strange argument and perhaps
achieves the opposite to what
is intended.
“One of the greatest hopes
for our way of life and one
.of the best safeguards of
Australian democracy is the
spread of share - investment
through the people.
“ ‘Own your own share of
Australia’ is a slogan the
Stock Exchange adopted, but
it carries with it not a pious
hope for more business but
the hope of the future in a
world where the growth of
autocratic Governments and
the loss of personal liberties is
constantly with us.
“The Stock Exchange’s
interest in the small investor
is a realisation of this fact.”
Trade Position Steady
Australian exports rose by
£l3O million in 1959-60,
and imports went up by about
£132 million. Trade surplus
for the year was £1.6 million
lower than in the preceding
year at £13.3 million. Total
exports were £941 million!
total imports £928 million.
There was a rush of import'
towards the close of the
financial year following the
removal of most import-restric-
tions in February.
Imports appear to have been

Wool has fallen in price
recently, and costs within Aus-
tralia have started rising again.
The first half of 1960-61
should put our over seas-trading
position to the test. The begin-
ning of the financial year is
normally one of low export
volume and comparatively high
imports.
Because of the inflow of

change reserves do not appear
to be a worry at present, but
excessive imports could make

Woe' worths at Darwin
[From «. C. Tilghman]
Qne of Darwin’s oldest
landmarks will disap-
pear when Woolworths take
possession of the premises of
A ' E. Jolly and Co., Ltd.
A. E. Jolly, with his partner
Euxton, opened for business
■jj 1883, and, for many years,
the y and P. R. Allen and Co.

as the Roper, and over-
ad to Newcastle Waters.
he present managing-
director, A. W. Jolly, a son
of the founder, was born in
Darwin in 1886, so he can
claim to be one of the oldest
Territorians still alive.
(Waldemar Holtze, son of
Dr. Holtze, is perhaps 15
years older.)
With Woolworths’ keen
merchandising methods, their
advent may mean a reduction
in the cost-of-living through-
out the Territory, for they will
shortly be opening in Alice
Springs, where they have
acquired another well-known
Territory business.
Yet the passing of one of
the North’s pioneer firms is to
be regretted. For over half
a century Jolly and Co. did
the major storekeeping busi-
ness in Darwin, and were a
most dependable firm with
which to deal. I wrote to them
when I was organising the first
car-trip from Brisbane to Dar-

This they did, and also
arranged for an additional

Brewery Takeover?
[From Canberra] ,
T arge takeovers are no
longer news, but one which
is rumored to be in the offing
will cause some raised eye-
brows. This is the reported
moves by Miller’s Brewery to
take-over Tooheys —for so long
one of the “Big Two” in the
liquor-trade in N. S. Wales.
The rumor started about a
month ago and has since gained
strength; it is now expected
that an announcement could
be made within the next few
weeks.
• Miller’s formerly known
as Britons —is no fly-by-nignt
concern. It has behind it the
resources of the R. W. Miller
coal-empire. For the past three
years the company has been
slowly, but unobtrusively,
spreading its wings, particu-
larly in suburban Sydney. It
has bought and renovated
many old hotels, and has also
built several new hotels in some
of the recently developed
suburbs.
Some weeks ago Tooheys
shares showed a decided jump
on the Sydney Stock Exchange,
but brewery officials deelinecf
to give any explanation.
Now Toohey’s £l-shares are
fairly steady at between 355.
and 40s.
John Darling Div.-cut
TTiversification has not yet
paid-off in the case of
flourmiller John Darling and
Son (Aust.), Ltd. Whereas
Allied Mills and Gillespie’s
appear to have done particu-
larly well out of their early
ventures into bakeries, John
Darling has so far found the
new mixture hard to digest,
and the result inclined to be
profit - reduced as much as
starch-reduced.
In the long-run, however,
ft seems certain to come out
on the right side, especially
as it will have the technical
know-how of Spillers (U.K.)
behind it.
In Victoria its association
with Austral Bakeries received
a setback following a fire at
one of the main factories, and
later it was found that cen-
tralisation of baking meant
higher costs of distribution in
some cases. Advertising has
added to overhead expenses,
but publicity and other pro-
motion outlay have been
necessary in view of the keen
competition met by the
Darling group, which extends
into N.S.W.
The cheering factor is that
sales have been increasing
notwithstanding the severe
competition in the flour,
stock-feed and baking indus-
tries, and it would appear that
in the long-run well-organised
sales-promotion will be justi-
fied, even if at the moment a
comparatively heavy expense.

Brisbane “Rigoletto”
Now in Brisbane at the end
of the Trust Opera Co.’s tour,
“Rigoletto” seems to have had
m o s t of its melodramatic
villainy rubbed off, and for
this reason some of its most
dramatic points are completely
blunted.
In the plot we have a lecher-
ous Duke of Mantua who is a
kind of Don Juan with malice
instead of humor. His affairs,
murders and other ducal amuse-
ments are planned by the mis-
shapen jester Rigoletto, who
should appear in the first act
as a rogue of the blackest kind.
His heart has one streak of
gold, however, and it shines
with fatherly love on his
daughter Gilda. She is care-
fully hidden away in a lonely
house where the amorous Duke
cannot indulge his tastes with
her, or so Rigoletto imagines.
The Duke’s discovery, wooing
and betrayal of Gilda come in
quick succession, and the
hunchback’s revenge carries
the opera to its terrible con-
clusion.
Verdi, though master of the
art of tuneful music, manages

• Verdi suddenly shows
his Rigoletto as a creature full
of compassion for his betrayed
daughter, and the music
matches the plot perfectly.
There are no barrel-organ tunes
that sound irrelevant, and the
brooding atmosphere fore-
shadows the drama of the
“Otello” of some years later.
Gilda, who has been a colora-
tura soprano in the early acts,
now becomes a real dramatic
heroine with no singing that is
purely decorative. Glenda Ray-
mond handled the coloratura
with ease and some charm, and
tackled the heroics of the final
act with an unexpected power
that lacked only warmth. Neil
Warren - Smith and Justine
Rettick sang and acted with
conviction as the assassin and
his sister.
The orchestra was conducted
by Eric Clapham in the first-
night performance, and if it
did not underline the starkness
of the plot in the first act it
made a highly satisfactory
sound in the great storm that
breaks in the third act. The
wailing of voices to suggest the
wind, thunder in the orchestra,
and some effective lighting
added-up to exciting Verdi, and
the most satisfying part of a
performance that opened
lamely.

Rostropovich
’Cello-playing of warm ex-
pressiveness and rich clear
tone made Mstislav Rostropo-
vich’s recital at Sydney Con. a
memorable event; no other
’cellist in the present reviewer’s
memory has been able to make
a naturally heavy-voiced instru-
ment sing with such flexibility.
Of the works chosen to ex-
press these virtues none was
more worthy or provided so
stupendous a test as the unac-
companied C Minor Suite of
Bach. Over differing moods
and tempi Rostropovich drew
upon practically all the re-
sources of the instrument, and
in the brooding contemplation
of the sarabande the deep, low
string seemed to throb with
the intensity of the feeling he
put into it.
Affectionate playing, too,
went into the F Major Sonata
of Brahms, an exposition of
cheerfulness in which the col-
laborator alt the piano (which
surprisingly had its lid closed)
was Alexander Dedyukhin. In-
tegration of tone in the fast-
dialogue work was just about
perfection, and the Brahms
songfulness when the tempo
dropped was exploited to the
full by both instruments.
It was not altogether surpris-
ing that a suite derived from
a set of seven of de Falla’s
most engaging folksongs was
successfully transposed for the
’cello, for, apart from their
native melodic richness, all
these songs are liberally laced
with entrancing Spanish
rhythms and Rostropovich
demonstrated with easy assur-
ance how a ’cello be
blithely put to their service.
The only below-par music
of the night was Shostako-
vitch’s 1934 Sonata. It would
be hard to imagine a duller
or more unmelodious work
written for this instrument.

Gerd‘ Kaemper
This young German pianist,
at his Sydney Con. recital,
ranged over a testing variety of
works to make clear that he is
putting to good use the time
he spent under the tutorship of
Walter Gieseking.
He began with the six
Rumanian Dances of Bartok,
folk-pieces played with rather
less enthusiasm than perfunc-
toriness. The “C hil d r e n’s
Corner” suite of Debussy drew
from him a much readier sym-
pathy ; these six little pieces he
played delicately and tenderly,
touching every nuance and
phrase with subtlety.
From there he swept into the
full-blooded sonorities of Schu-
mann’s “Symphonic Studies”
with fine authority, a marked
facility in the left hand and an
obvious flair for building the
big climax. But the most
rewarding aspect was his ability
to infuse into every bar the
true romantic spirit which
governs the work. In the
relentless choral march in the
final phase there was an attrac-
tive crispness and precision,
and if the fullest dynamism
escaped him it was less his
fault than that of a piano a
little gone at both ends as well
as in the middle.
His Beethoven, the C Major
of Op. 2, got a very good
measure of the youthful vitality
it deserves in both end -allegros.
The scherzo gave more than a
mere glimpse of the master in
his unbuttoned mood ; but it
was in the adagio, the soul of
the work, that Kaemper re-
vealed those qualities of mind
which point to future promise.
A sonata by the 18th-century
Bohemian composer Jan
Dussek, refreshing of theme
and classical in spirit, emerged
with a nice singing tone. A
brace of miniature Scarlatti
sonatas gave added proof, if it
were needed, of Kaemper’s
accuracy and dexterity at high
speed.

atonality into effects of grotes-
querie; at his best when, as
here, he sets his native wit to
the service of high jollity. This
is carnival on the rampage, and
in the 12 brief sketches the
composer maintains at high
inspirational level a limning of
characters as well as scenes of
immense vigor and gaiety. Only
once does he toss • aside the
cap-and-bells and the big drum-
stick ; that is when, in the third
section, he draws a tenderly
romantic scene with an un-
usually strong melodic line.
The pianist dashed-off these
musical daguerreotypes with
engaging spirit, the orchestra
matching him in impudence
and an air of insouciance.
The symphony was Tschai-
kowsky’s “Pathetique”—a read-
ing which, as to the first move-
ment, was not dynamic enough
to justify someone’s descrip-
tion of it as a “convulsion of
the soul”; but there was
genuine repressed sorrow in
pages of the second movement.
The leaping, swirling figures of
the second allegro emerged
with enough dash, and with a
really stunning climax, to con-
jure visions of Tartar hordes
sweeping across the steppes;
and the final section became a
quite noble expression of
human grief—a “page torn
from Ecclesiastes,” as Huneker
described it.
The other orchestral pieces
were a cutlass - brandishing,
roaring and altogether exciting
performance of Berlioz’s “The
Corsair” Overture, and a
thistledown treatment of the
delicate imageries of Debussy’s
“Afternoon of a Faun,” to
which rich contributions were
made by Claire Fox’s oboe and
Neville Amadio’s flute.

Some Background Facts...
On the Olympics
By "RECORDER"
The 17th Modern Olympic
Games, to be held in
Rome in August, are
actually the 311th
recorded Olympics in the his-
tory of competitive athletics.
Officially the first recorded
Games took place in 776 b.c.,
and so important did the
Greeks consider this institution
that they dated their calendar
from that year.
All wars stopped for a
month every time the Olympic
festival was held. Heralds
from Olympia toured the Greek
colonies from Sicily to the
Black Sea proclaiming a “sacred
truce” and guaranteeing safety
for travellers (competitors and
spectators).
The rules of competition
were strict, with only those of
pure Greek descent allowed to
compete. The Games had a
religious and sacramental sig-
nificance and were held on holy
ground dedicated to Zeus, King
of the Gods. His altar was the
centre of the festival (it is said
to have been the winning-post
in early times) and the Greeks
considered they brought Zeus
a worthy offering by conduct-
ing their contests at his feet.
In attaching exalted signific-
ance to the athletic ideal they
expressed, first, their idea that
to cultivate the beauty of the
body was a noble thing in it-
self; secondly, the Greeks
honored the trained man who
was always ready to defend his
country in an age when free
dom was held at the price of
constant vigilance.
They cared little for
“records,” but much for the
kind of proficiency that fitted a
man to march and fight. These
things constituted much of the
background of the Ancient
Olympics. Th e competition
was not for material rewards;
the victor was crowned with a
wreath of olive-leaves —an
emblem for which men con-
tended with a kind of religious
passion.
Competitors had to arrive
(without arms) a month before
the Games started. There was
no Olympic village; the whoie
scene became a jumble of
tents and huts, like a great fair.
Peasants, merchants, mounte-
banks, writers, poets and sculp-
tors plied their trades among
the tents.
The last day of the Games
was spent in rejoicing and
feasting. Then the victors
would be accompanied home,
to dedicate the olive crowns in
the temple of their city, and to
receive as reward free meals in
any restaurant or hotel for the
rest of their lives.
The Games made the Greeks
a race of athletes, and became
the symbol of the unity of
civilised mankind.
Women were not permitted
to attend the Games. One
woman who dressed as a man
to watch her son box was to
have been hurled from a high
rock to her death, but she was
spared when it became known
that her father and her brothers
had been Olympic champions.
TAuring the Roman era the
Games began to decline.
Apparently the sporting spirit
became a trifle fishy. Profes-
“I told you not to try to overtake Dr. Babs."
sionalism crept in, the usual
method being to arrange the
transfer of athletes from one
town to another. Astylos of
Croton is regarded as the first
athlete to be “bought” by an-
other town. As counter-action
heavy fines were imposed for
breaches of the amateur code,
and competitors guilty of cheat-
ing were forced to pay for the
erection at Olympia of a statue
of Zeus. Their “shameful
practice” was inscribed on the
base.
Today, archaeologists assert
that the ruins of Olympia con-
tain many great buildings used
for the recorded Games of 776
B.c. that were built hundreds
of years earlier. The most
recent diggings into the shrine
of sport uncovered one end of
the ancient stadium, and
showed that modern arenas
have little the old-timers didn’t
have. Theirs included starting-
blocks for runners. Doubtless
the fanciest blocks ever de-

Finally the Games caved-in.
Emperor Theodosus barred
them in a.d. 394, and a year
later the lovely valley of Olym-

by the barbarians. In the fifth
century the Statue of Zeus was
carried to Constantinople and
the Temple of Zeus, one of the
wonders of the world, was
destroyed.
Precisely 1500 years later the
first positive steps for the re-
vival of the Games were taken.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
Colonial Sugar Refining Co., Ltd.
-I,jo longer “colonial,” or dependent
JN entirely on sugar-refining, the C.S.R.
is one of the titans of the Australian
economic scene. Intensive and rapid
diversification of interests has improved
its earning-capacity and resilience, and
has le*d to large investments in a wide
range of industries.
Formed in 1855, the Colonial Sugar
Refining Co., Ltd., operates sugar-mills
in Australia and Fiji, sugar-refineries in
five Australian States and New Zealand,
and distilleries in Sydney and Melbourne.
The co. does not grow cane-sugar com-
mercially in Australia, and only to a
small extent in Fiji, but has extensive
facilities for scientific research, the re-
sults of which are made available to
cane-farmers. The C.S.R. refines sugar
and, as a Government appointee, mar-
kets almost the whole of the Australian
output. The co. is also the sole refiner
of sugar in New Zealand.
Other activities include shipping, pro-
duction of carbon-dioxide, and the
mining of gypsum and blue asbestos. An
extensive range of pharmaceutical and
industrial chemicals is manufactured by
C.S.R. Chemicals Pty., in which the co.
holds a 60 p.c. share-interest.
The large building-materials division
manufactures wall - board, asbestos-
cement products, floor- and ceiling-tiles,
building-plaster, cane - ite insulating
board, etc. Subsidiaries turn-out plastic
moulding-powders and cellulose acetate-
flake.
Distilleries in Melbourne and Sydney
make rum, methylated spirits and
numerous other products. There are sub-
stantial holdings in Courtaulds (Aust.),
J-td-, and Fletcher Holdings in New
Zealand.
In 1959 a considerable interest was
Squired in the insulation-industry. An
active part, involving heavy investment-
expenditure, is taken in the huge petro-
chemical project centred around Vacuum
Dil’s refinery at Altona (Vic.). C.S.R.C.-
Dow Pty. (50 p.c. C.S.R. Chemicals Pty.)
's expected to start manufacturing styrene
monomer in 1961.
Last term- Masonite Holdings was
a ken-over and a large majority interest
Acquired in the Bradford rockwool group
of companies in N.S.W. and Victoria
(through C.S.R.’s holding in 8.1. Hold-
ings Pty.).
In March, 1960, the C.S.R., with B. F.
Goodrich Chemical Co. of U.S.A.,
formed a joint co. (B. F. Goodrich-
C.S.R. Chemicals Tty.) to manufacture
polyvinyl-chloride. The co.’s subsidiary
(C.S.R. Chemicals Pty.) has a 40 p.c.
capital-interest in the new venture.
Construction work has commenced on
a new £2 - million hardboard - mill at
Bacchus Marsh (Vic.), expected to be-
come productive next January. Last
May, The Bulletin saw the Premier of
N.S.W. open Pyneboard Pty.’s new flake-
board factory at Oberon (N.S.W.). The
C.S.R. owns 60 p.c. of the new enterprise.
The co.’s accounts are trim and con-
servative. The accompanying reports,
attractively presented, are informative.
The main drawback is the absence of
consolidated figures, promised for the
current term.
The world sugar-market is still over-
supplied, and international prices are
low, although recent events which led
to the drastic slashing of Cuba’s quota
on the higher-priced U.S. market, may
benefit other producers.
Australia produced 1,250,000 tons of
raw sugar from mills in the 1959 season.
C.S.R.’s total output of sugar last term
was 72,f00 tons higher at 572,300 tons:

Production controls in Australia limited
the output of the co.’s Queensland mills
(C.S.R. owns 4 mills in Q. and 3 in
N.S.W., out of Australia’s total of 34).
In Fiji raw-sugar production rose by
43 p.c., exceeding the quantity that could
be marketed. “Costs were high, particu-
larly the cost of cane.” Profits from the
mills were “very unsatisfactory” and “in
general the co. is facing a difficult situa-
tion in Fiji.”
Profits from Australian sugar-mills
were “considerably lower” due to smaller
output and higher costs. Sales of refined
sugar from C.S.R.’s five Australian re-
fineries for the year to March, 1960,
amounted to 526,000 tons (up 5 p.c.).
N. Zealand sales also increased.
The co.’s other diversified activities
contributed handsomely to earnings.
“Substantial increases” occurred in the
overall sales of building-materials. Sales
of distillery-products continued to rise.
The co.’s two ocean-vessels had a satis-
factory year. The Masonite and Brad-
ford rockwool cos. operated successfully,
but their sales were not reflected in the
accounts.
C.S.R. Chemicals Pty. “substantially”
increased its turnover of industrial
chemicals and plastics. Rewa Rice, Ltd.,
a small wholly-owned Fijian rice-pro-
ducing subsidiary, is “progressing.”
All in all, C.S.R.’s net profit for the
year ended March 31, 1960, was dis-
closed as £343,349 higher at £2,882,633,
after setting-aside £2,739,937 for depre-
ciation (up £122,567) and unstated tax
provision:

as against 13.5 p.c. in the previous term

Some of C.S.R.’s massive inner st.re
was revealed by the huge jump in vi
reserves which (with undistrib
profits) increased by £8,567,391
£26,362,750. Of this amount, £1,943
was disclosed as premium on sh
issued in acquisition of Masonite
Bradford cos., £4,779,632 - was trans-
ferred from replacement and depreciation
.reserve and £1,193,954 came from re-
valuation of New Zealand assets. The
£336,457 loss “arising from the break-up
and disposal of Naussori mill” was then
deducted. Unexplained “minor adjust-
ments” added £5784.
The replacement reserve was shown
at £ 12,028,913. It is anybody’s guess
how much remains in the inner kitty,
but one may expect that this year’s con-
solidated figures will show a further sub-
stantial rise in visible reserves.
Sundry creditors and provisions
jumped by £5,574,764, including
£1,294,743 “owing to subsidiary cos.”.
Fixed assets were all shown at higher
book-values. Investment in subsidiaries
were up a solid £5,303,046.
The co. issued £2,412,440 of £2O ords.
as consideration for Masonite and Brad-
ford cos. If no additional capital was
invested in the other subsidiaries last
year, the rise in the book - value of
shares in subsidiaries should represent


the premium on C.S.R. shares issued in
the Masonite and Bradford takeovers.
Stocks (including sugar) were a bit
lower. Book-debts rose by £3,877,886 to
£15,795,551 (including £340,963 owed
by subsidiaries):

Debentures were steady at £7,000,000.
The recent £9 6s. Bd. a ton increase in
the retail price of refined sugar will not
affect C.S.R. as a seller or refiner,
although the co.’s sugar-mills will benefit.
Conditions in the world sugar industry
remain difficult. Negotiated price for
exported sugar under the British Com-
monwealth Sugar Agreement for 1960
will be £44 Bs. lOd. a ton (down 13s. 2d.).
Expectations of further small div.-
increases and the co.’s obvious strength
give the shares a high rating on the
sharemarket.
The chairman’s statement that the
board “expects to recommend” splitting-
up the £2O scrip into 20s. units, “in
association with and as a part of the next
major capital-issue whenever this may be
necessary,” was well received.
At the last sale in Sydney the £2O
ords. changed hands at £Bl 17s. 6d. The
immediate yield, on the basis of the 9
p.c. div.-rate, is a modest “blue-chip”
2.2 p.c.
Net tangible-asset backing (on parent’s
accounts only) works out at £44 19s. for
each £2O unit. If the £12,028,913 replace-
ment and depreciation reserve is included
with other reserves the net-tangible cover
rises to £56 12s. 4d.
General Credits, Ltd.
Pvolved in a credit-conscious western-
world, hire-purchase constitutes one
of the remarkable phenomena of the
20th century. In Australia the post-war
period—an era marked by increasing
refinement in business and business-
techniques—has seen a spectacular boom
in hire-purchase. In 1945 the debt out-
standing on h.-p. contracts was less than
£6 million. Spurred-on by removal of
Capital Issues controls, it reached £lOO
million by mid-1952, £2OO million by the
end of 1955 and today exceeds. £4OO
million.
General Credits, Ltd., entered the h.-p.
field in 1953. The newly-formed co.
quickly gathered to itself a galaxy of
business. Profits rose by leaps and
bounds, reaching £460,905 in 1958,
though a temporary reversal in the
following yoar took the figure back to
£382,243., ’
Finance-cos’, profits are determined by
the difference between charges made to
consumers and expenses, which include
interest paid on borrowed funds, the cost
of collecting instalments from the hire-
purchasers and bad debts arising by
default of borrowers.
Burdened by higher operating costs,
especially the heavier stamp-duties in
Victoria and N.S.W., and by increased
losses stemming from repossessions, the
lowered profits in 1959 were essentially
a reflection of the inability of the co.
to make full use of added funds while at
the same time it was obliged to pay
interest thereon—debenture- and deposit-
borrowing jumped by £4,111,364 in the
12 months and the interest-bill by
£313,874.
Latest result from General Credits
indicates a rapid recovery with full and
efficient utilisation of monies borrowed.
Competition was intensely fierce, losses
from repossessions were heavier and
operating costs rose. Nevertheless, the
flood of new paper that poured in last
term —h.-p. and other outstandings rose,
in all, £7,839,134 (up 43 p.c.) to
£26,121,765 —sent pre-tax profit, consoli-
dated for the first time, to a record level
(up £157,380 at £779,409 ; c.f. £768,675
in 1958). It seems extremely unlikely,
however, that the brilliant pattern of
previous profits-progress achieved by
General Credits will be repeated, let alone
perpetuated, in the future. The upsurge
of h.-p. finance is tending to level-off,
the volume of repayments to financiers,
as a whole, is now running not far below
that of new business, and boom spending
is likely to be followed by markedly
reduced borrowing—people will consoli-
date their position by paying-off existing
debts before incurring new ones. After
taxation, £318,879 (up £79,093), and de-
preciation, £18,940 (down £7349), net
profit ran out a substantial £78,287 to
the good, at £460,530:

The earning-rate rose in consequence
from 14.6 p.c. set in 1959 to 17.5 p.c., a
reasonable comment on the present state"
of the h.-p. market, as against 28.4 p.c.
(average) in 1958 and 12.1 p.c., 13.1 p.c.
and 23.6 p.c. back to 1955.
Originally a subsidiary of Automobile
Fire and General Insurance Co. (A.F.G.I.
hold 20 p.c. of today’s ord. capital),
General Credits, Ltd., sought additional
share capital from the public in 1955
(offering 2,000,000 ss. ords. at par), the
scrip being listed on the Melbourne
’Change in March of that year. Since
then the issued capital has jumped from
£BOO,OOO to £2,618,250. In August, 1955
the co. joined hands with the Commercial
Bank of Australia, Ltd., which under-
took to subscribe for 3,142,000 ords
par (C.B.A. holds 45 p.c. of today’s or!
capital). A one-for-five par issue to ore
shareholders accompanied this tran;
action, which gave the co.’s credit-ratin
with the investment public a tremendou
fillip, with the consequent advantage 0
cheaper loan-money.
The co. is controlled from Melbourne
with branch-offices in Sydney, Brisbane
Perth, Adelaide and Canberra. Two sub
sidiary cos. are established, the Regent
Insurance Pty. transacting reinsurance
and ancilliary business and the G.C.I
(Wholesale) Pty. handling wholesale
transactions for the co.’s dealers. Belli
offshoots contributed to group profits lasi
term.
Thus General Credits has strong ties
with both banking and insurance. Its
connections in these fields have greatly
facilitated the building-up of a sound
business in the financing of new and
near-new motor-cars and trucks, indus-
trial equipment for secondary and
primary industry and also a wide range
of domestic equipment.
An analysis of the balance-shea
emphasises the underlying strength of lb'

by way of unearned income as a perceni

whether or not a co. is making sufficie

principle this figure should not be le

From Herbert Holman
Not long ago there was a
queue of shows lined-up
f or production and no theatres
to accommodate them. Now
five West End theatres are
empty. The explanation is an
unprecedented succession of
flops— l 6 in two months.
Most of these failures de-
served no more ; they were ill-
conceived, if not downright
bad. The theatre, of course, is
unaccountable.
Nevertheless, it is incompre-
hensible to the layman that
shrewd men-of-business and
professionals of long experience
can sink their money and put
their faith into inane, crude
and inept ventures.
What significance there is in
this sequence of flops must
necessarily depend on surmise,
but one effect may be to im-
prove quality.
The Sage Who Recanted
The Mermaid Theatre, after
an indifferent phase, has
regained prestige with an
ambitious production of Bertolt
Brecht's “Galileo,” to which
there are as many credit titles
as usually attach themselves
to musical - comedy. Here is
another proof of the absence
of frontiers in theatrical life.
The original adaptation by
Charles Laughton (for produc-
tion in Los Angeles and New
York) has been modified and
extended by four men, includ-
ing Martin Esslin (“Red Page,”
29/6/’6O) and Bernard Miles,
who has visited Brecht’s widow
in East Berlin, seen the Ber-
jiner Ensemble production and
borrowed properties from
fhem. And the English version
ls Performed within the Square
Mile in a theatre which sub-
stantially owes its being to
capitalist endowment!
This chronicle-play suits the
broad, open Mermaid stage,
an d Bernard Miles, who is also
Producer and principal actor,
de Ploys his grouping with
splendid verve. He seems,
bough, to have taken-on too
much; sometimes the produc-.
tion flags and sometimes the
acting creaks.
As to Brechtian. methods, at
least one unbiased witness is
beginning to doubt and is turn-
ing deviationist. If narrative
projected on a cinema screen
helps the action along, then let
us have it, so long as the illu-
sion is not destroyed, but the
quatrains of doggerel are as
cloying as the jingles of com-
mercial TV and the alternation
of bright stage - lighting and
near - darkness is extremely
harsh on the eyes.
Mr. Miles covers some 30
years and is rarely off the stage.
He employs a provincial accent
and a benign, dignified and
faintly self-sad mien. This
Galileo has a quiet -strength,
because his intellect is so obvi-
ously deeper and greater than
those about him own. But he
is not the “born outsider, rebel
and maverick” of Kenneth
Tynan’s programme-note, and
at no time does he seem to be
at odds with his conscience.
He appears to take the easier
way of recantation —by a pro-
cess of cold logic.
Thinking so, one abruptly
realises the error. Brecht is
not Stanislavsky: the actor is
not intended to
but rather to stand aside and
let the audience judge. It may,
after all, be rather old-
fashioned to expect an actor
to act.
The Sage Who Wouldn't
Recant
Robert Bolt, author of
“Flowering Cherry,” is neither
a one-play nor a one-style
author. Of his two new plays,
one has a modern setting and
the other, now at the “Globe,”
is based on the life of Sir
Thomas More. The title, “A
Man for All Seasons,” is
taken from a contemporary
passage and is purely literary
insofar as it bears little sig-
nificance to the play.
Bolt and his patrons, H. M.
Tennent, Ltd., are both un-
likely names to be associated
with Brecht’s. He is an inde-
pendent man-of-letters who
belongs to no school, avant-
garde or otherwise, and Ten-
nents are the mightiest power
in the London theatre. But
both astonishingly have gone
Brechtian. It is to be hoped
that this new fad will have a
short life.
There is beautiful writing in
the play and scope for eloquent
and sensitive acting. Yet the
affair is tricked out with gim-
micks of which the chief is
the Common Man, a kind
of compere - chorus - scene -
shifter-small-part player, whom
the author causes, as it were,
to nudge and wink at the
audience in case they begin to
feel that the material is above
their heads. This picaresque
fellow is played with sublime
point, relish and agility by Leo
McKern (whose restraint, once
again, avoids his stealing the
show), but the device is irritat-
ing and cheap.
Paul Scofield’s Sir Thomas
More is not of all seasons but
of one, autumn, and rightly so.
It is, in fact, a beautiful and
sensitive performance which
even surmounts the trickery.
Most of the other characters
are either dramatically neuter
or crudely overdrawn.
Perhaps the author’s inten-
tion is to startle the audience
by visual shocks, many of them
pleasant, into grasping the
realities of the conflict between
the conscience of an excep-
tionally good man and a cyni-
cal, worldly society. Unfor-
tunately his artifice is too con-
spicuous.
Unrightable Wrong
Mrs. Santha Rama Rau’s
dramatisation of E. M. Fors-
ter’s “A Passage to India”
(Comedy Theatre) is good-
humored and entertaining,
despite the theme and period
(the novel was first published
in 1924). A member of the
audience who has neither read
the book nor has a close know-
ledge of the British Raj will
view the play as past history
—anything but glorious history
—and his sympathies will rest,
from beginning to end, with the
unfortunate Dr. Aziz. So we
have the paradox of a London
audience sitting back, laughing
with (not at) the well-meaning
young protagonist for racial
equality and taking his side
during the preposterous trial
for sexual assault.
The play begins at Fielding’s
house and ends immediately
after the trial. While keeping
faithfully to the shape and
essence of the book, perform-
ance has unavoidably brought
about a shift of emphasis. The
one character to be fully
integrated is Dr. Aziz, played
with superb finesse by the Paki-
stani, Zia Mohyeddin (who,
until recently, was better
known in Australia than here).
His gushing approach and self-
conscious social inferiority are
at once credible and, in the
light of events, poignant.
A large cas supports his
well - sustained
with varying effect. The odds,
it is true, are against them, for
they represent :
community and
enhanced by fear which unites
it with such fo and Suui
unreason in the novel is too
abstract for the mechanics of
the stage.
Dylis Hamlett, staccato,
prickly and anxious, bravely
nearly brings Miss Quested (a
novelist’s symbol, after all) to
life. Enid Lorimer makes a
forthright and intellectually
independent Mrs. Moore.
Norman Wooland’s Fielding is
pleasant rather than stub-
bornly rebellious, while Wolfe
Morris’s Professor Godbole is
pantomimic. But these and
other minor inadequacies in
production are not serious
enough to impair a stimulating
and thought-provoking even-
ing.


LIVING
PROOF
By
GEORGE CLIVE
At 10 o’clock one morn-
ing Paul Napier was
sitting beside Sigamutu,
the fat Papuan wireless
operator. He finished record-
ing the last of the morning
routine-traffic from headquar-
ters.
“Before you go, Sigi,” the
voice came from the receiver
harsh and clear, “the mission
at Bola Island wants to talk to
you. They listen on this
frequency but transmit on fifty-
two-fifty ; better go over to that
now. See you this afternoon ;
cheerio.”
“What do they want, Sigi?”
asked the young cadet. He had
recently been posted to this
Papuan outstation and was now
learning the radio procedure,
the daily life-ljne of communi-
cation.
“I dunno, sir; this is un-
usual. Look, it’s like this,” the
Papuan spun the big dial;
“here's fifty-two-fifty. Now we
turn up the volume and search
just here. I’ll try them. Trans-
mitting-switch down, red light
on. Right Calvados Station
calling Bola Island ; Calvados
Station calling Bola Island ; do
you read me? Come in, please,
Bola. Now switch back to
‘stand by,’ green light comes
on and we listen.”
Faintly against the back-
ground of static Paul could
hear the reply: “Bola Island to
Calvados. This is Father
Dumeresque. I desire to speak
to the A.D.0.”
“Let me have it, Sig.” Paul
reached for the microphone.
“Calvados Station to Bola
Island. I’m sorry, Father, the
A.D.O. is out in the jeep. He
won't be back till this after-
noon. This is Napier speaking.
We haven't met yet. I’m a
cadet here.”
Sigamutu again flicked the
switches for the changeover
and the French-
accented voice came
back.
- “Never mind, Mr.
Napier. I have pre-
pared a message here
in case Mr. Sullivan
was away. I will read
it to you. Address:
A.D.O. Calvados
Station. Text begins:
‘Strong and growing reports
threat to wipe out Lumi
and Nagoya villages by Kiha's
soldiers if he is held at Cal-
vados Government Station.
Sudest people very afraid of
Kiha.’ End of text. Signed
Dumeresque.”
The red light blinked again.
“Thank you, Father, I've got
that and I’ll give it to the
A.D.O. the minute he gets
back.”
'T'hat afternoon, worried
about the message (what
on earth could Kiha’s soldiers
be?) the young cadet prowled
restlessly up and down the
veranda, watching the road. He
ran down the steps to meet
Sullivan as he got out of the
jeep.
“This came in from Bola
Mission just after you left.”
Sullivan took the neatly-typed
message slip. Paul watched
him closely as he read, and
was surprised the A.D.O. took
it so calmly.
“What were you doing this
morning? Oh yes, learning
the radio. Where’s Pate?”
“He's up at the barracks;
you told him to check the
police-equipment against their
records.”
“So I did. You'll do-
round -up the Government
storeman, the sergeant of police,
the launch-captain and get them
in here as quickly as you can
and come in yourself.”
“Do you want Pate as well?”
“No, not now. I can never
understand him, anyway.”
t
“Please, sir, if you’re going
to take me to Bola with you,
couldn’t Barney come too?
He’s stopped being beatnik.
He’s got something new, now.”
“All right. If he can talk
again we’ll find a use for him.
We're going down to Sudest.”
In less than half-an-hour
Paul had collected Sullivan’s
chiefs of staff and he and
Barney listened to the quick
orders for a dawn departure.
Police, supplies, equipment,
food and fuel were dealt with ;
a radio message was drafted for
the Bola Mission and instruc-
tions given to Neil Fraser, the
patrol-officer, for the running
of the station during the next
few days.
Sullivan turned to the cadets.
“Now, you tWo. You’ve
heard me say, ‘Dawn sailing.’
Heaven help you if you’re late.
I’ve arranged for the food, so
you won't need more than
clothes, something to read,
smokes, that sort of thing.”
Barney Pate, plump and
serene-looking, remarked, “This
seems to be a rush job, sir.”
“The Bola Mission reports
that some mythical army is
going to wipe out a couple of
villages on Sudest Island, about
sixteen hours steaming to the
south. It's all nonsense. As
you know, I haven’t been here
long myself, but I’ve read the
Sudest files and they show that
it's the kind of nonsense the
Sudest people have been trying
about once a year ever since
anyone can remember. They’re
absolutely dominated by their
sorcerers. They seem to like
it that way.”
“Then, what's the hurry,
sir?” inquired Paul:
. “I want to get there whle
this is all fresh. The mission
has named Kiha, the chief
Sudest sorcerer, as the man
behind these soldiers. You
remember -him? He was here
all last week, being questioned
because someone had raised
the old bogy of cannibalism
on Sudest. As a matter of
fact he's on his way back now,”
“Do you thnk they really
are cannibals there?”
“No.” Sullivan laughed. “It's
not possible. They’ve been cen-
sused every year for years and
w'e’d notice any disappearances,
but I’m sure they'd like to think
they were. . That’s all. The
jeep will call for you at five
tomorrow morning.”
"PUext- day the 40ft. launch
threaded her way south
through the island passages
and reefs that ranked the Cal-
vados chain among the most
beautiful and most dangerous
of the world's seaways. 1
In the evening they anchored
off Para Island and went ashore
by dinghy to inspect a new aid-
post building. Its outline stood
starkly square among the softer
more kindly shapes of the
villagers’ atap huts. Sullivan
had called on the doctor before
leaving his station and collected
medical supplies for this newly*
built aid-post. These he co-
vered to the tall, smiling native

Fishing with Lolo
Night on the Reef
By CHARLES MacGREGOR
WE had arranged with
Tobias to come along
in the good ship Kero-
sene Can to run us
across one night to the long
reef at Eua Kafa, where the
fishes had not recently been
disturbed.
He would not be along till
about nine-o’clock, after the
moon had set, so Lolo and I
went meandering about in the
bobao that the lad had
borrowed from FaleVai rela-
tions.
We did not find anything
very interesting in the shal-
lows around Nuku, since the
reef-pools and coral-patches
had been thoroughly fished
with the poison-vine, but we
found a patch of weed where
the tanu-tanu (bury-bury)
black-spotted sea-perch were
moving through the weed or
lying almost invisible in little,
bare, sandy pockets.
Bury-bury gets his native
name from his habit of diving
nose-first into the soft sand, the
strokes of his upended tail
driving him under in a few
seconds. Even where Lolo
could not see a fish lying on
one of the small bare patches
he made a few deep stabs into
the sand and picked three or
four fish from their hidey-holes.
I used to have lots of fun
with the little tanu-tanus which
came in to feed quite close to
the beach if there was a slight
surf running, and they bit
greedily at hermit-crabs. I
never caught any that were
more than two-pounds in
weight, but they gave quite
good sport with light bait-
casting gear, and they ran in
good-sized schools.
T 010 did not often make a
/ bad slip, but just as we
heard the first loud pops of
Tobias’s Kerosene Can and
started to wade ashore through
the shallows he saw a whirl of
water behind a boulder, and
with a quick thrust he impaled
a big soki-soki (porcupine-
fish) that promptly blew itself
up like a football.
Lolo shook it off the spear
with a “Sa’a !” of disgust, and,
of all things, kicked it!
While he performed a one-
legged hula to a song of his
own composition and expres-
sion I sat down in a foot of
water and laughed helplessly—
at least I had started to laugh,
but my sudden contact with the
very long, very sharp and very
brittle spines of a sea-urchin
nearly doused the light and
gave me something to laugh
about.
“Why you laugh, Tungata
eiki ?” Lolo had been protest-
ing. “Is very pain, my toe.”
“Profound apologies, Lolo.
I not laugh any more. Is very
pain, my bottom.”
“Hi, Tobias,” I called, as I
heard the old Scandiwegian
wading ashore. “Come on up
to the camp and get the
tweesers and the iodine. We've
got a couple of minor opera-
tions for you.”
So Tobias came “oop” to
render first-aid, “stern first,”
but Lolo spat like a tomcat at
sight of the iodine-bottle —he
had once had iodine poured
into a crack in the leathern,
sole of his foot. And when a
Tongan spits out “ Sa’a!” even
the hermit-crabs scuttle off.
\TS7E beached the bobao and
* * hung up the fish we had
caught and waded out to
Kerosene Can to find on board
Tobias's boatman, a six-foot-
three-inch-large lad called
Sikaleti —a' real king-sized
Cigarette.
He had brought along two
heavy four-pronged spears, one
twelve-feet and the other
fifteen-feet long, as well as
Tobias’s lantern.
We swung the head of the
motor - boat round and
clambered aboard. The noise
of her exhaust must have
wakened everyone on the
island as she started-up and
headed for Eua Kafa, an island
about three miles to the south
and connected by a long, wind-
ing reef, the greater part of
which was bare at low tide.
We were towing a ten-foot
broad - beamed rowing - boat,
which gave us just enough
room for the two spearmen to
work in comfort when the fish-
ing started.
We dropped the anchor in
about two fathoms of water
on the north side of Eua Kafa,
and after lighting the lantern,
which had been refilled in the
beam of the flashlight with a
hand-operated generator (bat-
tery-cells died young in that
damp climate), we boarded the
dinghy.
Tobias took the oars and
worked the boat stern-first
along the edge of the reef.
I sat in the stern, holding the
lantern, and little Lolo and
big Cigarette stood one on
each side of me, their spears
poised, ready for action.
WE had barely started when
an eight-foot shark
swirled into the circle of light
on the seaward side of the
boat, gave it a slap with its
tail as it turned, and was off
again before anyone had time
to make a thrust.
The reef-edge was swarm-
ing with fish of all sizes and
colors: their vivid hues were
not as brilliant as they
appeared in the daytime from
a glass-bottomed boat, or
through .a water-telescope, but
everyone on board had a clear
view of what was happening
in the coral within a. twenty-
foot radius.
The boys collected some
good-sized parrot-fishes and
wrasses, and a silvery ten-pound
trevally, one of a school ot
about a dozen that swung
towards the reef and quick!
out again ori Lolo's side, while
1 entertained myself by scoop-
ing-up with a coconut-she |1
baby fishes, shrimps and W‘ e
squid one or two inches M
that lay dazzled or swa®
slowly along right on
surface. ~
A small school of need
fish, about nine-inches
went into a leaping P^ 111 '
Two of them fell into the boa-
to be tossed overboard -
Sikaleti with “Go home, si J
babies! ” y
There was no sound but
continuous murmur of
south-easterly swell on


oU t e r reef some miles to the
eastward, but the silence was
soon broken by a sudden
“boom, boom, boom,” like a
hi 2 drum beaten in the
distance.
“What’s that, Lolo? Not a
w hale beating the water?”
“No, too quick for whale
and different sound. Whales
not coming on this side —too
many reefs. Sometimes they
come in the deep steamer
channel on other side, but not
much now —whalemen kill
nearly all. That a school of
big mullet —they running away
from some very big fish;
might be valu out in the deep
water.”
Later on I was to see as
well as hear the same sort of
thing—the bonito flying-fish
act, on a much larger scale ;
four amazing and perfectly
synchronised leaps, at inter-
vals of about four seconds, of
a large school of very big
mullet, while several black,
sickle-shaped fins and tails
swished through the water in
their wake.
A long deep sigh broke the
ensuing stillness. “Koe
fonu,” whispered Lolo, and
as Tobias swung the ~ boat
round we saw the widening
circles made by the big turtle
when he came up to breathe.
It was no use looking for him,
so we turned towards the reef
again.
A large, dark object on the
sandy bottom of a little bay
between two coral buttresses
caused Lolo to grasp his spear
tensely while he said in a
whisper, “Another big fonu.
A very big one. Fai fai malie
[go slowly] ki utu, ki utu [to
the shore], Sai !” —and down
went the spear into nine-feet
of water with all the force
that Lolo could put into it.
Then there was i struggle
hat nearly shook Lolo over-
°ard, as he yelled, “Koe
~T a ra y, a great big ray
m■ , r !? g tde other spear,
qu l ck ; ’
And down goes the second
pear with all of big Sika-
he*a We * gk behind it, into the
iW the great ray that
• around ’ stirring-up the
' n bloodstained clouds as
wh'l ° at roded and pitched
with 6 n^ e two boys leaned
n all their weight on the
spears to keep the fai pinned
to the bottom.
Tobias manoeuvred the boat
to keep the stern directly
above the ray and prevent the
boys from falling overboard,
and the eight wounds, four
in the middle of his back, and
four behind the eyes, soon
took all the kick out of him.
When his struggles ceased, the
boys worked him up through
a break in the reef onto a
shallow platform, where he
lay in about a foot of water
with his thorny back above
the surface.
His short tail swished
dangerously close to Lolo’si
legs as Lolo climbed out onto
the reef and reached back for
the short axe. The first chop
severed the tail at the butt
above the deadly barbed
spines and the second crashed
into his skull.
It was as much as the four
of us could manage to drag
the great brute off the reef-
platform into the boat and
tuck him under the thwarts.
He was a little too wide for
the boat and his wings pro-
jected beyond the gunwale on
each side.
He was also a confounded
nuisance in the boat, since the
thorns on his back were sharp
and all of us were barefooted,
but Tobias wanted to take
him back to the native village
at FaleVai, where there would
be a great feast next day. More
revolting stuff for * a feast I
could not imagine.
CJhortly after getting the ray
on board we did find a
fair-sized green turtle lying
still on the bottom in a little
more than ten-foot of water.
Sikaleti made a great thrust at
it, but his balance was prob-
ably upset by the ray under-
foot, and the spear, instead
of piercing the shell, glanced
off and impaled a front flipper.
It gave a tremendous heave
and made off. Lolo was out
of position for a thrust, and
Sikaleti held on till the boat
threatened to capsize. He then
let go, sprawling backwards
on top of Lolo, who was just
about to dive in after the
spear.
Lolo rose from his thorny
couch and spat “Sa!” while
Tobias took a Scandinavian
breath and told Sikaleti off.
Perhaps it was just as well that
could not follow it all, but
got the gist of it:
A good new spear lost! A
fine big turtle lost! And
why? Why didn’t the hope-
essly incompetent offspring of
a hundred generations of rat-
eating, dog-eating, bat-eating,
leather - shoe - eating Fijian
cannibals—why didn’t the idiotj
go overboard and climb down-
wards along the spear till he
L the , turtle ’ gras P the
set behind the front legs,
sit well back, pull upwards
with his hands, press down-
ward with his feet, and so
bring the turtle to the surface
in true Tongan style? Because
he was ka leve leva —a
cowardly cuckoo!”
Sikaleti had perfectly good
excuses—-because he forgot;
because he was not able;
because his foot slipped on
the ray ; and because he was
afraid that the big shark
might come back. But all
that did not appear to satisfy
either Lolo or Tobias.
I asked why they did not
fix a harpoon-line to the spear.
Well, they should have
done ; they should have had
one ; but it was only a nuisance
when they were spearing small
fishes, and as they seldom
needed it they just did not
bother about it.
As there did not seem to be
any more big fish about,
Tobias suggested a run across
to Mounu, where should be
lots of spiny lobsters on the
reef in the making tide. So
we boarded the motor-boat
again, transhipped our un-
pleasant cargo, and headed
westward for a couple of
miles.
Then we slowed-down, and
Sikaleti went forward to guide
us without any hesitation
through the long, winding,
narrow channel in the reef.
He did not want the lantern,
as he said the light confused
him, but he had eyes like Beka
the fruit-bat, and he knew the
reefs as well as he knew the
village paths at FaleVai. He
may have been a poor fisher-
man, but he was an excellent
pilot.
We ran across Mounu lagoon
till the water began to shoal;
dropping anchor, we boarded
the dinghy and landed the two
Tcmgans at the reef, each of
them with a short stabbing-
spear, a lantern and a sugar-
bag.
Tobias and I rowed around
trying without success to find
a place where we could hook
a fish more than nine-inches
long.
A big needle-fish made a
luminescent break on the dark
surface of the still lagoon,
and the brilliant lanterns threw
flashing circles of light on the
shallows of the outer reef over
which a long surge was begin-
ning to swell.
Lolo’s voice came ringing
' high and clear across the
water, so we rowed across to
the edge of the reef and
relieved the boys of their
loads: eight large spiny
lobsters, four each —so Sika-
leti is not such a bad fisher-
man, after all—and a few
more reef fishes.
As we headed back to Nuku,
I noticed the Southern Cross
low on the horizon and
Antares shining brightly over-
head.
“Do you know that star,
Lolo?”
To my surprise he answered,
“10, that is the heart of
Sikopio —very red tonight—*
I think he is angry for us
because we kill his kainga
[relations] the lobsters.”
Morning was near; the
cocks already crowing from
over at FaleVai.


New Guinea and Self-government
How Much Too Soon?
When the Prime Minister arrived
back from his world tour he
said he had changed his mind
about the timing of self-deter-
mination for New Guinea. Earlier, he
said, he had believed it was better to go
slowly in granting independence, but
now he felt that the right view to take
was “if in doubt go sooner,” by which
he meant that he would rather see the
native people of New Guinea given
self-determination before they were ready
for it than risk the hostility delays would
cause.
A few days earlier Paul Hasluck, Min-
ister for Territories, had said that “the
Papuans, the largest single group of
extremely primitive people in fhe world,
will not be ready for self-determination
for thirty years.”
Any contradiction between the two
statements would depend on what
Menzies meant by “sooner,” and he
clearly did not envisage any move in
the immediate future, because he said
his change of opinion did “not mean
that you can write a timetable out for,
say, twenty years’ time.”
Prodded by U.N.
AT least once a year the U.N. Trustee-
ship Council tries to prod Australia
into setting a target-date for indepen-
dence: The 1960 prod was administered
within a few days of the Prime Minister’s
return, prodders-in-chief being the Soviet
and Indian representatives on the Coun-
cil. The prod took the form of a resolu-
tion inviting Australia
to formulate early successive inter-
mediate targets and dates in the field of
political, economic, social and educational
development in New Guinea so as to
create, as soon as possible, favorable
conditions for the attainment of self-
government or independence.
As Paul Hasluck pointed out imme-
diately after the Trusteeship Council’s
report was released, Australia long
ago committed itself to the political,
economic, social and educational
advancement of the people of Papua
and New Guinea, but considers that the
making of decisions on the best way of
reaching that objective is its own respon-
sibility.
The Minister said that this country
was prepared to set target-dates, “imme-
diate and realistic,” for stages of educa-
tional, social and economic advancement,
but he made it clear that the political
factor was not so simple. Australia’s
experience, backed-up by that of every
Power which had had similar problems,
was that while social and economic
advancement necessarily led to political
advancement, the reverse was not true-
political change was not necessarily fol-
lowed by social and economic improve-
ment.
Australian Policy
This was something that needed to be
said ; in the rush for self-govern-
ment too many people seem willing to
believe that the desire for freedom is
all that is needed to make a people
capable of self-government, and that the
granting of independence transforms
overnight a backward colony into a
self-reliant nation.
Hasluck said that Australia had based
its policy on “major efforts to set up law'
and order, health, hygiene, education,
a better food supply and means of earn-
ing a living among a people who are
still largely primitive.” By training
natives in (1) the handling of affairs by
democratically elected local-government
councils; (2) economic affairs through
co-operative societies and group and
individual enterprises ; (3) public admin-
istration through membership of the
public service and (4) participation with
Europeans in membership of councils
and boards Australia had prepared the
people for more political advancement.
For the past nine years there had been
three nominated native members on the
New-Guinea Legislative Council. It was
now felt that experience on local coun-
cils had made it possible for direct repre-
sentation on the council to become a
reality for a substantial section of the
population. Effective representation re-
quired that members should be chosen
by the people and not nominated. The
Government had proposals ready for
reform of the Legislative Council, but
these could not be proceeded with until
the High Court gave its decision on a
challenge to the validity of the Legisla-
tive Council itself. These proposals
would increase the non-official member-
ship ; give direct representation to a
large section of the population and other
forms of representation to the more
primitive areas. Beyond that point it
would be only guesswork at present to
say when and in what way other political
changes would follow. “We see no kind-
ness in making human beings walk over
cliffs in the dark.”
Last week, after talks, with representa-
tive groups in New Guinea, the Minister
said that everyone was “apparently
thinking very close to the way the
Government is thinking.” In this he
was perhaps being a little optimistic, but
at any rate he was told by whites and
natives alike that there should be greater
native representation on the Council, in-
cluding elected natives. He met no articu-
late demands for immediate, or even
early, self-government. To most native
spokesmen it was a long-term aim.
Dutch New Guinea
TAevelopment in Papua and the former
Mandated Territory is primarily
Australia’s responsibility and concern,
but this country cannot be indifferent to
what is happening in the western half
of the island. Holland, as the country
administering West New Guinea, is also
subject to continual prodding, not only
from U.N., but also from Indonesia,
which covets the territory for itself, and
from a section of homeland Dutch who
want to get rid of what has become an
unwanted burden.
The prodding seems to have been so
effective that with West New Guinea it
is no longer a matter of too soon or too
late —the decision has already been made
to do it too soon. The only point now
in dispute is how much too soon.
Dutch spokesmen have indicated that
they are thinking in terms of "within ten
years,” or even earlier. The Netherlands
Parliament is even now debating a bill
to “accelerate the political development
of Netherlands New Guinea"; its aim
is to enable, the natives “to become
familiar with bearing responsibility” and
also to let them “participate on an equal
footing in shaping the policy to be pur-
sued for their future.” This is a com-
mendable aim, but the details of the
legislation reflect the tremendous task the
Administration faces in trying to make
aims conform to hard facts.
A small Council is proposed, at least
half of its numbers to be elected. Direct
vote is the ultimate aim, but in backward
areas the population “can make recom-
mendations as to their representatives.”
There are also to be village-, town- and
district-councils, “elected without any
discrimination,” which will participate
directly in the central administration,
with certain tasks delegated to them.
How Long? -
A ll this sounds- very worthy, but the
problem, as in the Australian terri-
tory, is how long will it take?
Less than two years ago the Dutch
authorities were remarking on the lack
of any political organisation bigger
than the village and saying “the real
social unit is not even the village, but
a much smaller segment of the popula-
tion.” Only in the coastal areas, for
example, were village chiefs to be found;
elsewhere small groups tended to fend
for themselves and there was no forma-
lised authority embracing the whole
population of the village. Yet now the
administration is apparently prepared to
believe that hundreds of these villages
can be adequately represented on the
Council by one man ; the population is
700,000 and the proposed strength of the
Council is 28.
It is most unlikely that the Administra-
tion has really changed its mind to this
extent in so short a time. It is far more
probable that sustained prodding is the
real reason for hastening the programme.
In West New Guinea, as in the Aus-
tralian territory, education and training
have a long way to go before the native
people can be considered ready for self-
government. On published figures our
own end of the island seems, from the
native viewpoint, the more advanced of
the two. If a premature relinquishment
of responsibility brings chaos to New
Guinea, as it has to the Belgian Congo>
the end-effect on Holland, half a world
away, may not be of vital importance,
but geographical realities force Austral l3
to take a less detached view.

Sydney Horses
Judging by his two stylish
wins at Warwick Farm since
returning from a spell, there
seems to be a bright future for
the three-year-old colt Gene
San, raced by J. W. and W.
Clinton, and trained at Nar-
ellan by H. T. Sherd, who
expects to soon move his team
to a city track. Gene San is
by the French sire Genetout,
whose progeny have won the
best part of £300,000 in stakes,
and is from Protection, a half-
sister to Crown Street by
Stockade (imp.) from Cineraria
(E.) by Diomedes. Back in the
family-lines appears Cinna, a
winner of the English One
Thousand Guineas, and half-
sister to Spearhead (imp.), sire
of many smart Australian
stayers. Gene San’s win in the
seven-furlongs Winter Handi-
cap at the Farm last Saturday
—his third success in open
company—has induced connec-
tions to aim at the Epsom or
the Caulfield Cup, maybe both.
He seems an ideal type for the
Caulfield mile-and-a-half. He
has won in the past six months
at one mile, seven furlongs,
and 10 furlongs, and he was
third in the 12-furlongs A.J.C.

now, and to the list was added

when he rode with skill and
determination to land the Clyde

Yvette. At the top of the
straight Kerrie appeared to
hold an unassailable lead, but
she isn’t noted for stamina, and

Harrier put up a fine display
to land the Encourage from the

“Postscript”: How is it that
on heavy tracks fast squibs go
just as fast early as they do on
fast tracks, yet hang on much
better towards the end? I’ve
noticed that this happens
repeatedly both in Melbourne
and Sydney. Admittedly, times
registered on wet days are
slower all round, but seldom
correspondingly slower over
the sprint courses as at one
mile and beyond. This in-
consistency applies to most
“stoppers”; not to mudlarks
particularly.

to an inch.” He was as clever
and vigorous as ever in his
wins on Payray (Novice) and
Harrier (Encourage) at the
Farm on Saturday.

At Caulfield
This year’s National winners,
Justification and Blacksmith,
ran at Caulfield on Saturday,
but neither was equal to win-
ning. The handicapper always
exacts a heavy price for a
National win, and Justification
was up from the 9.10 he carried
at Flemington to 11.4 in the
Leamington Hurdle, and it was
more than he could handle.
After being in a winning posi-
tion at the half-mile, he only
plodded on into fourth place.
Sundial won the race with
something in hand, and book-
makers lifted him to favoritism
for the Australian Hurdle.

Trainer Fred Hoysted and
jockey Peter Riley took the
jumping double at Caulfield,
and a profitable double it was,
too. Sundial started favorite
in the Leamington Hurdle, and
Recurrent was a solidly-backed
4-to-l chance in the Redleaf
Steeple. It is an honor for any
horse to win the Redleap,
named after the best jumping
horse Australia has ever
known. Riley, who rides with
dash and courage, handled Re-
current beautifully. Black-
smith, with 10.1 ? u
more than his National vyeight,

fit to win after a five-months
spell. Solidly backed, Samson
beat a useful field pointless.
Owned by Mrs. H. L. Catch-
love, Samson is by Nilo (imp.)
from the Big Game mare Hora,
who was imported by Dr. H. L.
Catchlove. Samson’s spring
mission is the Caulfield
Guineas.
Fiery Eyes put up a good
effort to win the second division
after having to find a path
through the fallen horses. He*s
a chestnut colt by Smokey Eyes
(imp.) from Carelda by Car-
pentier. Mrs. Peter Grant Hay
races third-heat winner Bengal
Tiger and she and her husband
used to Face the colt’s dam,
Casino, a decade ago. By Nul-
labor (imp.), the colt is all
speed, naturally ; his dam was
a sprinter, and Nullabor
won three races in England
over five furlongs and one over
six.
• '•mm
A good deal more may be
heard of Glenpedder, who won
the mile Lillimur Two-year-
old. The field was better than
average for this time of the
year, and Glenpedder’s finish-
ing all over them suggested
better things to come. He’s a
chestnut gelding by Empyrean
(imp.) from the well-performed
Silver Crest. Attley, sire of
Glenpedder’s dam, is also the
sire of Foxley, who won the
six-furlongs Kambrook Handi-
cap. After losing by the nar-
rowest of margins to Jet Gun
at Flemington, Foxley deserved
his success, which was gained
easily against a field of smart
sprinters. An interesting run-
ner in the Kambrook was
Romancing, a four-year-old
New Zealand gelding having
his first Australian start. By
Knight’s Romance from Castle
Princess, Romancing has good
sprint form in the Dominion,
and his second to Foxley after
being blocked in the straight
was the promise ‘of an early
win.
The V.R.C. committee caused
a surprise by granting Miss Jean
McPherson permission to train her
own horses. The only other
woman ever licensed to train in
Victoria was Miss D. Shiel, who
was owner-trainer of Precocious
when he won the Grand National
Steeplechase in 1932. Miss McPher-
son is a daughter of Jim
McPherson, who trained with some
success a decade or so back.

The Golfers
“C.S.”: Good to see Kevin
Donohue get his chance with
this year’s N.S.W. golf-team.
Kevin has been knocking on
the door for some years now,
and his fine performances
this year, particularly in the
State championships, gave
him his well-earned place in
the team. Another newcomer
is Ted Ball, who also has a
fine record this season. The
“new boys” will replace Peter
Heard and Noel Wade (who
has not produced his best
form in Sydney events).
The team goes to Perth next
month for the National
championships and inter-
state teams matches, for
which they are the logical
favorites, the more so as
Australia’s outstanding ama-
teur, Bruce Devlin, will be
playing for N.S.\y. for the
first time.
Features of the British
Open:—
Of those that did not qualify
in the British Open the most sur-
prising failures were Van Donck,
who had just won the trophy for
the best individual score in the
Canada Cup, and Thomas, who
recently announced his intention
to concentrate solely on tourna-
ment golf. Triple Open winner
Henry Cotton also failed, but that
was not quite so surprising—he
first won the event 26 years ago!
Leading the qualifiers on 135
was the reigning champion, Gary
Player. His score was so good
that some were saying he had
“left his run on the course,” and,
as it turned out, his putting
deserted him when the tournament
proper started. Two others with
fine qualifying scores, Irishman
Christy O’Connor and veteran
Gene Sarazen. “blew-up” in the
first round, O’Connor taking an
80 and Sarazen an 83.
Mexican Roberto de Vincenzo
set a hot pace with a six-under-
par 67 and repeated the perform-
ance in the second round. On
the final day he was two strokes
ahead of Nagle, with Palmer and
Thomson a further five strokes
away on 141. Player, despite his
poor putting, broke par each
round to be on 143, and it looked
as certain as it turned out to be
that the winner would come from
one of these five, the others near
the lead not being expected to
have the strong finish needed for
such a ’ tough event.
In the third round Vincenzo
went two-over and Nagle took the
lead. Palmer picked up a stroke
and, four behind going into the
final round, made a great bid to
repeat his American Open per-
formance, when he shot a record
last round to take the title by a
stroke. But Nagle held on too
well, and his shot to the 18th
green left him two putts for the
title from only three feet.

“Golfer”; After 58 years of
chequered existence the N.S.W.
Country Golf Association
merges this month with the
Golf Association. The
merger will streamline adminis-
tration, cut costs that could no
longer be met by the Country
Association, and make it
easier to control tournaments
throughout the State. One
effect will be to bring into line
some country clubs that had
“gone their own way” and
ignored the C.G.A., knowing
they could get away with it.
That’s over.
* * *
“Round”; When first intro-
duced ripple-soles were barred
by golf-clubs, players being
told they must use the con-
ventional spiked shoe. Now it
has been proved that the ripple-
sole does the least damage —
if it does any. Thousands of
tests made in U.S.A. have
shown that spiked shoes
caused the most damage.

Other Sports
All-out to avenge their
humiliating defeat in the second
Test in Brisbane, the French
Rugby League tourists came
back with a bang on Saturday
to win the third Test, 7-5, at
Sydney Cricket Ground. For
France, Dubon a try, Mantou-
lan two goals, and for Aus-
tralia, Bugden a try, Barnes a
goal. Playing with the old fire
and determination that League
followers had given up hope
of seeing from them on this
tour, the Frenchmen placed
a query beside the names of
two or three hitherto Aus-
tralian “certainties” for the
World Cup tour ...
In the weekend League round in
Sydney Saints, 23, just made it
against Souths, 20; Wests, 23, beat
Norths, 21; Balmain, 13, beat
Manly, 12; Easts, 29, beat New-
town, 11; and Parramatta, 30,
upset Canterbury’s semi - final
hopes, 18.
* * #
University put it all over Rand-
wick in Saturday’s Rugby Union
clash, 23-6; Norths and Drum-
moyne staged as much stoush as
football in a savage 3-3 draw (both
goals); Manly were altogether too
hot for Gordon, 22-8; St. George
beat Parramatta, 16-6; and Easts
routed Eastwood, 25-6.
“Lai”: At time of writing
Melbourne, now odds-on favo-
rites for the premiership, lead
the V.F.L. field with Essendon
a handy second and Colling,
wood and Fitzroy next. St
Kilda, South Melbourne and
.Hawthorn are trailing that top
four ; the rest —Carlton, Foot-
scray, Geelong, North Mel-
bourne and Richmond-
already look out of the race.
Lately promoted to the Rich-
mond team, young Jack Dyer is
a son of the great Jack Dyer
who captained and coached the
Tigers for nearly two decades.
* * *
In Saturday’s V.F.L. round
Melbourne Demons continued their
winning way, trouncing Norths
15.13- Essendon also kept up
the good work, at Hawthorn’s
expense, 16.11-10.13; Geelong,
11.13, beat Footscray, 8.4; Fitz-
roy walloped Collingwood, 17.10-
13.18; St. Kilda downed Souths,
11.13- and Carlton administered
another belting to the Richmond
Tigers, 15.20-8.8.
* * *
“Kabara”: A few years ago
star Collingwood and Vic-
torian wingman and rover
Thorold Merrett was tipped
as the player most likely of any
then playing to beat present
Essendon coach Dick Reynolds’s
V.F.L. record of 320 games. Since
then Merrett has run into a share
of injuries that would now seem
to have put him out of it. He
began with the Magpies when he
was 16, and is well past the 150
games; he has never been dropped
except through injury. But in
1954 he missed 12 games when
he broke a leg, and in 1957 he
missed nearly half the season
after a car-accident just before the
season started. Against Carlton
this year he again broke a leg.
It is most unlikely he will play
again this year, and he may never
recapture his best form. Merrett
is a master of the short stab-kick,
possibly the best exponent of it
in the V.F.L.

“R.A.M.”: Can any ’Rules
team beat this record? In the
under-16 section of the com-
petitions cpnducted by the
Geraldton (W.A.) National
Football Association St. Pat-
rick’s College lads have not had
one point scored against them
in the last four matches, and
their tallies have been; 2U-
(138 points), 25.19 (159 points),
40.20 (260 points) and 17- J
(125 points). During the sea-
son the only scores against
them have been four goals, and
they lead their premiership
ladder with the astronomic
average of 4054 per cent.-
points for and 24 against.

“Lai”: Ernie Bolton, cham-
pion Victorian and Coburg

the greatest pitchers ever pro-

ing for nine years, and has
pitched for Victoria four times.
With Coburg since 1957, he has

“Aussie Ruler”: Australian
National Football Council sec-

the ’Rules game is worth about

dustry and transport benefited
by the code, which in Mel-
bourne attracts about 150,000

“Keima”: Former English
Rugby League Test vice-
captain and centre Phil Jack-
son, now captain-coach of
Goulburn Workers in the N.S.W.
Group 8 competition, says he
knows of several top English
League players who are anxious
to settle and play in Australia.
He names prop forward Alan
Prescott, 1958 tour captain, other
1958 tourists Mike Sullivan, Eric
Frazer, Tommy Harris and Denis
Goodwin, big 1954 forward Nat
Silcock (whose father, also a big
forward, toured Australia with
England in the 1930’5), and 1950-54
double tourist Ken Traill, who
coached the 1960 English Cup
winner, Wakefield Trinity. Jack-
son said Traill was “envious” of
his departure for Australia. If
the “signing ban” were lifted,
Jackson said, he was sure other
players would also be interested.
It’s certainly time the “poaching
ban” was removed; it would
undoubtedly be good all round,
as also regards giving young Aus-
tralians the chance to gain experi-
ence (and a few extra bob)
playing in the English League.
Apropos, Jackson’s presence is
considered to have given Group 8
football a “shot in the arm.”

“Bob Ray”: The Inter-
national Federation decision
not to sanction Open Tennis-
tournaments must have sur-
prised many. The overall
standard at Wimbledon was far
short of previous years, and a
change looked warranted.
Actually, the majority at the
deciding meeting favored Open
tennis by a vote of 134 to 75,
but the old-fashioned rule says
there must be a two-thirds
majority, and so Opens are out
for another two years.
* * *
“Tennisite”: The international
character of Wimbledon was cer-
tainly emphasised in this year’s
series. Neale Fraser (Australia)
won the singles from fellow-
Australian Rod Laver; “unknowns”
Rafael Osuna (Mexico) and Dennis
Ralston (U.S.A.) won the doubles
from the British pair Mike Davies
and Bobby Wilson; Brazil’s Maria
Bueno retained her ladies’ singles
title by defeating South Africa’s
Sandra Reynolds, the Brazil chajmp.
also bagging the ladies’ doubles
with America’s Darlene Hard;
and Miss Hard (U.S.A.) and Rod
Laver (Australia) won the mixed
title from Bob Howe (Australia)
and Miss Bueno (Brazil). It’s a
healthy change for tennis; there
hasn’t been such an international
flavor for many years, the finalists
since War II having been mostly
Americans and Australians.
Incidentally, Osuna-Ralston were
the first unseeded pair to reach
more than the semi-finals since
seeding was introduced in 1928,
and Australia had no finalists in
the men’s doubles for the first
time in 11 years.
* * *
“Kabara”: South African
fast-bowler Geoff Griffin’s hat-
trick at Lord’s —the first in a
Test at the home of cricket —
will be one of the most sensa-
tional exits from Test-cricket
(supposing it is his exit, as it
appears to be). Possibly the only
comparable exit is Australian
Hughie Trumble’s 7-28 (including
the hat-trick) in the second innings
of the fifth 1903-04 Test in Mel-
bourne. Griffin’s was the fifth
Test hat-trick taken in England.
The first was by England’s J. T.
Hearne at Leeds in 1899 (a remark-
able Australian trio, Noble, S. E.
Gregory and Hill), and the most
recent before Griffin, Peter

UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
DISARMAMENT
What does the abrupt Soviet
withdrawal from the
Geneva disarmament talks
mean for the future of this
vital topic? Some overseas
press comment:
New York ‘‘H era l d
Tribune”: “This suggests that
whatever successes Mr.
Khrushchev has won in the
debate with Peking are purely
verbal; his policy conforms
to that of the tough Stalinists
around Mao. The Geneva
walkout came at a time when
the United States was on the
verge of presenting new pro-
posals ; whatever their chance
of acceptance, no one sincerely
interested in negotiating for
the relief of military burdens
would have refused to hear
them. The assumption is that,
for all his talk of disarma-
ment, Mr. Khrushchev is not
really interested in the sub-
ject; that, as the Red Chinese
have openly said, he has put
forward his plan for .complete
disarmament solely to ‘expose’
the West—that is, simply for
propaganda purposes.
“If this is the case, why the
argument between Moscow
and Peking? In Stalin’s day,
the dictator himself was fond
of speaking mildly and letting
his subordinates talk tough
on matters of foreign affairs,
Perhaps Khrushchev is using
the same technique. Or per-
haps there are real conflicts
within the Kremlin and the
Communist empire. In any
case, Mr. Khrushchev has
only his own acts to blame
if the world at large can see
no genuine distinction be-
tween what he does and what
the Red Chinese do, however
they may differ in words.”
* * *
London “Daily Telegraph”:
“The truth would seem to be
that, for whatever reason, the
Soviet Union is at present
engaged in another period
of cold - war propaganda-
manoeuvring. Mr. Khrush-
chev has made it abundantly
clear that he does not intend
to do business with the
present American Administra-
tion. Possibly this may
simply be an excuse to dis-
guise his own internal prob-
lems. But whatever the reason
it is time the West brought
its own timing and tactics into
line with this current Soviet
mood.
“While the kind of Western
delays prompted by genuine
doubts and problems make
sense in serious disarmament
negotiations, they can all too
easily be exploited—as they
now have been—in the kind
of shadow-boxing which is all
the Russians seem willing to
indulge in at present. The
West cannot be content with
a posture of injured
innocence. Far more vigorous
tactics are needed if the Soviet
Union is to suffer proper
injury for its own guilt.”
* * *
London “Time and Tide”:
“The Soviet withdrawal is
evidence of an important
change of method in Khrush-
chev’s policy towards the
West. It does not, as some
commentators have alleged,
suggest that Khrushchev is
deferring to Mao Tse-tung’s
insistence on a ‘tougher’ line
in capitalist-Communist rela-
tions. The reverse is probably
true.
“Mr. Zorin’s statement in
Geneva ‘that it would be
more profitable to continue
discussions on disarmament
at the United Nations reflects
a growing conviction in Mos-
cow that it would now be
wrong to write-off U.N.O. as
an appendage of the State
Department. The independ-
ence of a new batch of
African States gives Khrush-
chev and Gromyko reason to
believe that they will soon be
able to command a per-
manent majority in the United
Nations Assembly.”
* *
“New York Times”: “They
[the Russians] announce that
instead of negotiating seriously
they will again take the dis-
armament issue before the
United Nations General
Assembly in the expectation
that the increasing accession
of newly formed neutralist
States will turn it into a more
promising propaganda forum.
They also hope, as Premier
Khrushchev and other Soviet
spokesmen make plain, to
frighten the American people
into electing a more amenable
President and to alarm the
Europeans and thereby split
the West. Finally, as the
Soviet delegate indicated at
Geneva, they hope to placate
the Chinese Communists by
forcing their admission to any
future disarmament con-
ference.
“In this situation the West
—London “Daily Mail
NO APRON-STRINGS.
will do well to close its ranks
more tightly than ever.”
* * *
London “Economist”: “The
most ready verdict will be that
the Soviet leaders have now
revealed their hypocrisy. \
more charitable, or more
prudent, one is that they have
mainly revealed their unreadi-
ness. Serious thinking about
disarmament seems scarcely
to have even begun in
Moscow.
“There is a relevant phrase
in the Soviet Premier’s letter
to the French President—an
appeal to ‘examine the argu-
ments with understanding and
without preconceived ideas.’
It has been virtually impos-
sible, to date, to get Russians
to discuss disarmament in any
such fashion. The Soviet press
has printed torrents of
polemic, but not a single
serious analysis of the rival
programmes, contending argu-
ments and underlying factors
The numerous studies of the
problem by groups and
individual authors in America,
Britain and other countries
have not been matched in
Russia. (A first study-group,
it may be encourag ng to
learn, has just started work
in Moscow, but the prospects
of any searching debate
developing are poor.)”
* sfc *
London “Spectator”: “It is
hard to feel any sorrow about
the fate of the disarmament
talks. Up to the time of the
Summit many Western dele-
gates argued that they were
worth while, even if they did
not achieve much, as a clear-
ing-house for ideas ; that they
kept East and West talking
together, fairly amiably. Of
the Western delegations, the
British were perhaps the most
inclined to take this line,
because they felt that as
honest brokers they had a
valuable part to play, break-
ing-down distrust between
Americans and Russians. But
the Summit showed just how
little they had ach'eved ; and
it is almost certainly better
to have no pretence of cor-
diality or co-operation where
none can exist than to go on
wasting time in futih
negotiations.”

In just 12 months Goodyear Imperial has firmly
established itself as the finest car tyre ever built in

previous tyre. That means it lasts longer, that it
resists bruise breaks and damage from kerbs,
potholes, rough roads, fast cornering and hard

tyre. Its greater strength comes from the nylon cord
which is tempered like steel by the exclusive Good-

The Same Pot
A n East German story, told
editorially by the Man-
chester “Guardian”:
“A few weeks ago a cam-
paign for communal cooking
was started in East Germany.
The farmers, who had just
been collectivised, were told
that everybody should ‘eat out
of the -.same pot.’ Meals were
to be supplied by the village
inns. That would ease the lot
of the farmers’ wives: their
menfolk would eat in the
fields, their children at school,
and the village inns would
become ‘cultural centres,’
where the family might get
their supper and even their
breakfast. (And no one would
then be tempted by the
privacy of the family table
to say what they thought
about communes.) Com-
munist China seemed about
to be emulated in Saxony.
“No wonder, therefore, that
this splendid vision encour-
aged the manager of the
Chinese pavilion at the agri-
cultural show near Leipzig to

siasm by proclaiming that the
Chinese people’s communes
were about the most advanced
products of human develop-
ment.
“But that proved too much,
both for the East German
Communists and their Soviet
mentors. Professor Stanislav
Strumilin, a prominent Rus-
sian economist and theoreti-
cian, was alerted. He gave
an interview to the official
East German newsagency
which clearly put the Chinese
in their place. Future com-
munes, he said, would not be
‘miserable community centres
with common kitchens and
the perpetual moaning of
tormented women and
mothers.’ People would retain
the right to look after them-
selves and v to have individual
kitchens.
“In its comments, the
official Communist - party

No Hiding-place
"Crom U.S. “Business Week”:
“Modern technology
changes all things, including
the spy business. The Nathan
Hales and Mata Haris give
way to the U-2, the Midas and
Samos earth-satellites and the
bugged, eagle in the Embassy in
Moscow.
“Indeed, in this swirl of
technological progress it be-
comes extremely difficult even
to define what a spy is. Is the
eye-in-the-sky a spy if it goes
up 100 miles? Does it become
a spy if it cruises at only 20
miles, 10 miles, five miles? One
simple formula would be to
define anything you can shoot-
down as a spy. Comrade
Khrushchev apparently thought
it would be gauche to call our
U-2 a spy before he finally
brought one down. He has
not objected to our sending
surveillance-satellites over his
territory, nor we to his over
ours.
“But it becomes a most com-
plex mathematical problem in,
relativity-theory to say when a
very high-flying satellite is
actually over some nation’s
territory. Is this to be done
by calculating an imaginary
perpendicular, stuck up in space
like a radio antenna from the
spinning globe, which a satel-
lite, orbiting on its own course,
periodically intersect s —or
what? Assuming you had a
. missile that could hit it, would
it be an act of aggression to
shoot-down the satellite if it
were found to be over its
mother-country at the time of
impact?
“And what about the bugged
eagle in the foreign Embassy?
Can he be shot-down? Can he
even be spoken to rudely by
the people he is bugging?
Stalin apparently asked that the
British admiral be sent hom e

remarks about the Russians (h e
said they were ‘barbarians’) i

“The one. hope that emerges
from this technological revolu-
tion of our time is that, in a
world in which there is no place
to hide, both spying and war
may become obsolete.”
Cuban Troubles
r T'HE Cuban Government’s
A seizure of British- and
American-owned oil-refineries,
which pushed U.S.-Cuban rela-
tions into their present state of
extreme stress, is seen by
London “Daily Telegraph” as
dangerous to Cuba itself:
“Cuba’s revolutionary Gov-
ernment has been anti-Ameri-
can from the start; since this
February, when a trade-agree-
ment was signed with Russia,
its willingness to be linked with j
Communism, from whatever
motives, has been perfectly
obvious. What seems certaia
now is that the concealed
American support which, para-
doxically enough, has kept the
country, and therefore the
regime, off the rocks from dap
to day has been recklessly en-
dangered.
“Already American tourism
has practically ceased. With-
out this source of income

resources have had to be care-
fully husbanded. Oil for the

What is even more important
the American legislation under
which half the island’s sugar is
at present sold in the United
States at preferential prices hi
been amended.
“In view of what has hah
pened, it will be very difficuh
for the Administration to resist
pressure to reduce Cubas
sugar-quota, and with it one of,
her principal remaining source
of foreign exchange. Expro-
priation of the American sugar-
mills will not replace this M
income.

Two other British comments:
London “Daily Mail’’: Our
sympathies in this situation
must go to the Americans.
They have been strongly pro-
voked by Castro since he
marched into power 18 months
ago.
“Admittedly the Americans
erred originally by becoming
so closely < identified with the
oppressive Batista regime which
went before. A reaction against
‘Yanqui’ influence was bound
to come with the new regime.
But most of the great goodwill
originally earned by Castro has
been progressively eroded by
the events of the past few
months. The start of the dis-
illusionment came, of course,
before that—with the revolting
mass trials, with little suspicion
of justice about them.

that the U.S. supported the
corrupt regime which he over-
threw, and he suspects America
of plotting his downfall by in-
citing neighboring countries to
intervene in Cuba. His trade-
agreement with Russia,
tion to Mr. Khrushchev and
overtures to China probably
signify an opportunist attitude
in the East-West conflict rather
than adhesion to the Com-
munist camp. His truculence
puts a great strain on American
forbearance, but intervention
or economic sanctions might
excite sympathy for a ruler
who has as ruthless a way with
political opponents as the
familiar South American
tyrants.”
Dragnet Digest
C. L. Sulzberger, in “New
York Times”: “When Marshal
Malinovsky recently declared
that Soviet missiles would be
launched against the base of
any aircraft intruding over
Socialist territory, he specified
the word Socialist rather than
Soviet. Socialist means Com-
munist in Moscow’s lexicon.
“The Russians have long-
range missiles capable of strik-
ing any point on the globe.
However, it is unlikely these
would eve/ be used to shield a
land of minor strategic import-
ance to the U.S.S.R. such as
Guinea, or possibly Cuba, even
if they were to declare them-
selves ‘Socialist’ and sign a
Soviet pact. But what would
be the Kremlin’s decision were
the vast and wealthy Congo to
take such steps? Does Russia
contemplate, as an ultimate
African policy, establishing an
ideological Monroe Doctrine
that would ignore geography
and try, eventually, to dominate
all Africa?”
* * *
London “Financial Times.”:
“There is clearly a danger that
either by default or because
former colonial Powers, react-
ing unfavorably to the vigorous
nationalism of newly indepen-
dent States, decide to wash their
hands of the whole affair, the
Communist Powers will steal a
march on the West in Africa.
It is thus disturbing that apart
from their general subscription
to liberal principles the Western
nations have so far failed to
concert a policy for Africa.
“In particular an agreed line
on Soviet aid to the new terri-
tories is long overdue. No one
in London seems to have
decided whether, for example,
the economic advantages of
Soviet participation in African
development-projects are out-
weighed by the obvious politi-
cal risks.
“To take a specific instance:
Should Soviet financial assist-
ance in the extension of Con-
akry airport be welcomed, oil
the grounds that Western
sources would otherwise have
had to foot the bill? Or should
it be regretted because of the
concomitant penetration of the
country by numerous Russian
technicians?”

“Washington Post” : “Mr.
Kishi’s successor will have an
enormous task of restoring
order and of leading the
country out of the intellectual
fog that led to the riots. In
part the revolt of the students
and labor-groups (aside from
the Communist element)
seemed to be against a satellite
status for Japan. The new
regime, regard ' "'Hat its
political com
will need to demonstrate
more clearly that Japan is not
tied to the American kite. In
the years ahead the demand
for a more independent
policy is, certain to increase,

medical orderly who met them
N’jiro was a good medical
man, proud of his work and
himself, immaculate in white
shorts and T-shirt.
The qadets were out of their
bunks at first light, eager to
start again and, at the same
time, enjoying the soft warmth
of the tropical dawn. But Sul-
livan lingered over breakfast
and at eight-o’clock settled
down to write-up his journal.
After yesterday’s scramble to
leave, the cadets were puzzled.
Barney went to the wheelhouse
to sound-out the native skipper.
“When do we start, Tom?”
he asked in Motu.
“Dohori, Tabauda later.”
The big, cheery sailor looked
up at the sun. “In the early
morning the sun is too low to
see through the water, and
when we leave here we go
straight into Gold Rush Chan-
nel, very dangerous, plenty of
reefs.
The cadets learned that the
channel had been named after
a real gold-rush of long ago.
But the last miner had left for
greener, or more golden, pas-
tures years before the war.
With the closing of the mines
the only reason to navigate
Gold Rush disappeared and the
knowledge of the passage
through the reef was lost. Even
in*the old days, the channel
had claimed victims. Broken
hulls rotted among the many-
colored coral and the tides
came and went through their
skeletal ribs.
Tom took the wheel him-
self, and with his free hand on
the throttle - quadrant nosed
carefully along at half-speed.
For’ard, a sailor, one arm
hooked around the forestay,
leaned over the sharp bows,
searching the water through
Polaroid glasses. As the ship
lifted and fell in the long swell,
the fangs of coral came closer
and sank away.
The mile-wide channel lay
between the guarding reef and
the green shores of Sudest
Island. The deeper parts
showed as pockets of midnight
blue among the shimmering
powder - blue and turquoise.
Combers breaking on the outer
reef flung random splashes of
blinding white against the sky-
line.
Two hours later the launch
crept into the small, sheltered
harbor of Lumi village, and its
anchor-chain racketted through
the fairlead.
CJullivan spent the afternoon
in a rest-house, the police-
corporal on one side of him,
the interpreter on the other,
steadily and patiently question-
ing most of the 100 villagers.
The two cadets wandered
around the village and its
gardens. They noticed that it
was an ill-kept, slovenly place
compared with Para Island of
the night before, and wondered
how far this might be due to
the clutch of sorcery oa the
villagers. By three - o’clock,
hot and bored, they were back
at the rest-house.
Paul was restless and irritable
because he had nothing to do.
Barney, with his usual air of
detachment, had produced a
book from inside his shirt and
settled down to read it in the
shade.
“Hypnotism!” Paul jeered,
as he looked over his friend’s
shoulder. “Why can’t you grow
up? You’ll get us into trouble
yet. First you arrive such a
beatnik that the Boss can’t
understand you and now this
bull! God help us if the A.D.O.
finds out. He’ll think you’re
round the bend again.”
“Not at all,” replied Barney
with dignity. “I hope he’ll see
me as a serious student. After
all, we’re here to learn, and
this isn’t so far from sorcery!”
Paul turned away in disgust.
Barney called after him:'
“Don’t lose your block. It’s
too hot! Would you believe
me if I hynotised someone?”
“If you hypnotised anyone,
I’d believe anything.”
“Right - ho,” Barney rose
with a grunt. “Care to bet a
quid?”
“You’re not serious, are you?
You’re not going to try this
stuff on me!”
“Oh no. Those two police-
men should be all right. I’ll
ask them. Let’s go up to that
garden. I need a few things.”
/ In the garden Barney picked
some ripe bananas and a few
sweet - potatoes ; he scraped
them clean with a knife. This
done, he got the two nervous
young constables comfortably
settled with their backs against
a log. He stood in front of
them idly swinging a brightly
polished compass while he
spoke to them in slow, sooth-
ing Motu phrases.
Paul recognised the words
for “tired” and “sleepy” being
repeated and was amazed to
see the constables closing heavy
eyes.
“Now for the hard part.”
Barney appeared pleased and
confident. “This’ll really slay
you.” He selected two thin
sweet - potatoes. “Constable
Kaisa, Constable Tagosi, do
you hear me?”
“I hear you,” each replied.
“Listen well, then ; I have in
my hand two big, ripe bananas.
You are hungry. Are you
hungry?”
“We are hungry.”
“Open your eyes, then, and
look at the bananas.” Barney
held out the raw sweet-potatoes.
“Are they good bananas?”
“They are good.”
“I have peeled them for
you.” Barney cut the skin olf.
“Take them and eat.”
Each man accepted a potato
and began doggedly munching
at the repulsive food. Paul,
who had been dumb with
amazement, found this too
much. “Barney, for heaven’s
sake, cut it out. Stop them!
Can you?”
“Of course I can.” Barney
snapped his fingers close to the
face of each man and said:
“You have slept; wake now.
Wadain! It is enough!”
The police hastily spat out
what was in their mouths and
retreated, muttering to each
other.
/"\n their way back the cadets
w were met by the corporal
hurrying to call them to the
rest-house. Inside, they found
a worried Sullivan looking
down at a slight youth propped
in a chair.
“There you are!” he greeted
them. “We’ve got trouble. I’ve
got thirty pages of notes ; no
evidence. This is the only
witness on the island who’s
game to say anything about
Kiha and his threats. He went
sick on me while he was talk-
ing. He looks bad.”
“What do you think it is?”
asked Paul. “Fright?”
“No, it’s worse than that.

On the way over he said:
“You see, those pickets are
bound top and bottom with
heavy bands of hoop-iron.
You couldn’t pull one off
without pulling thfe whole lot
off. No one could do that!”
As we neared the fence the
white picket could be seen
lying in the gutter. In the
fence was a small, rarely-used
gate on which the pickets were
not bound, though all the
others were. It was from the
gate the picket had been
pulled.
Flashman stood and
stared.
“Well, I’ll be damned,” he
said. “My apologies, old man.

and the reporter for the
“Nyngan Observer” betook
themselves to a pubbery
(Barrett’s, I think it was) and
called for “long - sleevers”

At the subsequent hearing
the Mayor, the aldermen,- the

grave doubts concerning the
accuracy of Dick’s timepiece.
With odds of about 10 to one

doomed to defeat. The

remarks about the “weight of

Before very long there was a

An hour after starting the
launch burst out of the Gold
Rush Channel and set course
for Para. Sullivan, looking
strained and tired, exchanged
a grin and a wave with Tom,
shoved his polaroids into his
pocket and called down the
hatch for tea.
The three officers were sitting
in the sun on the for’ard
hatch when a tall man climbed
the companionway, carefully
balancing a cup of tea in one
hand. Thin, grey-haired and
fierce-looking, in spite of his
dirty hands and dirtier shreds
of clothing he had personality.
His hard, lined face and digni-

to a man of importance. He
passed Paul and Sullivan with-
out a glance and handed the tea
to Barney with an air of defer-

“I’ll never understand that

It was unusual enough that

like to interrupt before, but as
the doctor had gone past on his
way to bed he had said that
the youth would recover.
“Thank heavens! ” ejaculated
Sullivan. “I’ve got something
here I don’t understand. This
chap Kiha’s quite prepared to
talk about terrifying the
Sudesters ; he’s even described
some of his methods, such as
putting a man’s name or clan-
totem in a matchbox and tap-
ping it when he wants to be
rid of him. But whenever I put
it to him that this is foolishness
and there’s nothing in it and
he must know that, he starts
to look frightened and says,
‘Ask the young one.’ It must
be one of you.” What the
hell does he mean?”
The cadets looked at each
other, frowning, bewildered,
“I dunno,” said Paul, “we
haven’t . . .”
Barney lost his air of detach-
ment, He reddened. “Oh no!
He couldn’t . . .”
“Couldn’t what?” snapped
Sullivan harshly. “What were
you two up to that afternoon
while I was in the rest-house
at Sudest?’
“Nothing really” said Barney
“it was only a joke.”
“Joke nothing!” broke in
Paul heatedly. “He hypnotised
two constables. It was marvel-
lous. They ate raw potatoes
thinking they were bananas!”
The A.D.O. took a deep
breath. “I thought I knew the
worst about cadets. If it makes
you feel any happier, you’ve
beaten fifteen years of
experience. But will you please
explain? What the hell do you
think you’re doing, hypnotising
police?”
“Well, sir,” Paul took up the
tale, “it was Barney’s new
hobby, after he stopped being
beatnik. You couldn't believe
it till you saw him in action,
but it looks as if Kiha must
have been watching, too.”
Sullivan looked suspiciously
at Barney: “Tell me exactly
what happened.”
Very embarrassed, Barney
described the incident. Sulli-
van’s cold blue eyes never left
his face.
“Anything else?”
“Well, yes. As a matter of
fact, I gave those two police a
fiver each. They wouldn’t do
it for less. I rigged the whole
thing, even to having the book
in my shirt. Paul had been
riding me about my hobbies
and I thought I’d give him a
lesson.”
“You. can give me my quid
back, too!”
Barney disregarded this.
“There’s no harm done, is
there?”
“Of course there is.”
Sullivan was not amused.
“You may have caused Kiha to
talk, but you’ve confirmed him
in a belief in sorcery that he
may never have had. Some
of these sorcerers are only
con.-men.”
“Oh Lord!” groaned Barney.
“Trouble again! What’s going
to happen to me?”
“That’s a good question,”
replied Sullivan, “particularly
as I’ve just thought of the
answer. You’re going to get
those two constables and Kiha
and your little Motu book and
you’re going to explain to him
about your sense of humor and
then convince him that there is
no sorcery and I don’t care if
it takes you the next two
years!”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
Tasmanian Dentistry
I read with disgust “B.D.S.’s”
contribution in B. 6/7/’6O.
My association holds receipts
and affidavits which prove that
many Tasmanian dentists are
still charging double the fees
of mechanics.
The average charge for cer-
tificates is £1 Is., but here again
some dentists are charging ex-
cessive fees ranging from £4 4s.
with X-ray to £1 10s. without.
“B.D.S.’s” only factual state-
ment is that there is no tax-
reba' tor mechanics’ patients,
whicn ~eems to be a point of
jubilation to him. But this is
only an indictment of the
Federal Government and a
further indication of how one
section of the public is being
discriminated against by the
Australian Dental Association.
Mechanics in Tasmania are
finding no difficulty in having
either ante- or post-denture-
fitting surgery performed by
most competent dental sur-
geons, who are prepared to co-
operate with mechanics in the
interests of the public and in
an endeavor to make an Act of
her Majesty’s Government
function as it is intended to.
The allegation that there has
been no recognised training for
dental mechanics does not
-accord with facts. Before
mechanics could sit for the
registration examination they
had to prove they had been
employed as dental mechanics
for at least seven years; they
attended lectures by a dis-
tinguished Doctor of Dentistry
and a Master of Dental
Surgery, under the auspices of
the Australian Dental Associa-
tion and the Tasmanian Gov-
ernment.
The examination was con-
ducted by an eminent Doctor of
Dental Science, on a curricu-
lum drawn-up by the Dental
Mechanics’ Registration Board,
consisting of a medical prac-
titioner—the Director of Public
Health as chairman, two
dentists and two dental
mechanics. This section of
“B.D.S.’s” letter is an indict-
ment of the board.
Figures of court-proceedings
will show that’ illegal dentistry
was no more prevalent in Tas-
mania than in any other State.
Now it does not exist, also
according to records. This sec-
tion of the Dental Act is in
the hands of the Dental Board,
and any criticism by “8.D.5.” is
only another condemnation by
him of dentists.
The number of dental prac-
titioners registered in Tas-
mania since the Act became
law on July 1, 1958, up to pub-
lication of the latest list in
the Tasmanian Government
Gazette (2/3/’6O), has shown
an increase of 16, which is
more than 20 per cent. —to

dentist who left the State for a
time, only to return.
My association does not
want to enter into public argu-
ments ; it appreciates the co-
operation given it .by the
majority of dentists in Tas-
mania. However, malcontents
like “8.D.5.” cannot be allowed
to go unchecked. — lan Wis-
hart Smith, President, Tas-
manian Dental Mechanics’
Association.
“8.D.5.” (B. 6/7/’6O) either
doesn’t know the position or
handles the truth very care-
lessly.
The dental mechanic is not
licensed ; he is registered to
make dentures for the public
if he satisfies the examiner
that he is capable, just as the
dentist becomes registered if
he satisfies an examiner.
“8.D.5.” says there has been
no recognised course of train-
ing for mechanics. He appar-
ently knows nothing of the
five years of apprenticeship
.which the mechanic does
entirely on prosthetics. In
the university-course done by
a dentist 18 months are set
aside for prosthetics/
Regarding fees, I suppose
to some people the difference
between the 50gns. charged
by some dentists and the 15gns.
charged by some mechanics is
hardly worth noting!
If “8.D.5.” actually knows
of any “questionable” prac-
tice, why doesn’t he make it
known to the Tasmanian
Dental Board (composed of
dentists, whose job is to police
illegal dentistry) or to the
Dental Mechanics’ Board,
whose job is to administer the
Act to dental mechanics?
And what, may I ask, are the
other fields into which some
mechanics are said to be
extending? The Tasmanian
Parliament decided that, after
due examination, dental mec-
hanics could be registered to
deal direct with the public, and
it employed a most competent
examiner to attend to that part
of the Act.
It is accepted that there is
a tremendous shortage of den-
tists, not only in Australia, but
throughout the world. The
World Health Organisation has
stated that to overcome this
shortage the dental profession
will be required to co-ordinate
its ancillaries to give more
positive assistance by doing
work for which the ancillaries
are trained, thus leaving the
dentist more time to devote to
saving natural teeth.
Fortunately most dentists in
Tasmania accept and abide by
the law and do everything
possible to see that the Den-
tists Act, 1957, benefits the
public— Prorsum et Semper

Prison Training
I'll endorse “Plain Austra-
lian’s” comments on this sub-
ject (B. 22 /6 / ’6O). But what
is also needed, badly, is the
acceptance of a fine or a jail-
sentence as punishment for a
crime and not, as it is now,
merely a down-payment on a
debt for which the culprit is
forced to pay life-instalments,
Lately I investigated the case
of a young English migrant
who had worked in W.A. on
a previous visit, returned to
England for a few years, then
came here again with a wife and
young family. Almost immedi-
ately he got a job as a tech-
nician in a Government depart-
ment —a job for which he’d
been trained in England, and
at which he’d worked there,
His work in W.A. was satis-
factory,’ as far as he knows;
but he was dismissed, without
being given a chance to appeal
or defend himself, when in-
vestigators discovered a con-
viction recorded against hint
for a minor offence on the
previous visit.
A utility he owned and drove
had been used by a friend in
stealing parts from prefabri-
cated houses they were helping
to put up. He had accepted;
his friend’s assurance that the
parts were spare and unwanted
(some of them were, too) and
the magistrate’s view of the
offence was reflected in the line
—a fiver. The principal in the
crime was fined less than £5O.
This lapse could reasonably’
be attributed to youth and in'
experience, and the fine should
have been adequate punish'
ment. But now that man, who
is as good a citizen as youd
meet, and a technician, seems
condemned to laboring. 7
least he’s debarred from pu [ '
suing his trade and from a»
Government employment.
Probably there are hundred*
of such cases. The public set
vice is closed to every yo^ l
whose escapades bring him lo

sort of a record is obviousl)
under a much heavier handicap

When we realise that more than half on
migrant children have been educated in
since 1947, we begin to see the force of the great
human exercise we are performing in ca ■rving on
our programme of immigration.
Another half-million children bv r. in
Australia with one or both parents a migt have
also gone into our schools.
Those are high figures for a country whose
total population even now is just over ten million.
For one thing, it shows how very many people in
Britain and the Continent of Europe have come
to Australia because they believe it is a good
country in which to live and to bring up
their children.
Consider, for instance, the content of migration
from Britain alone. Australia now is taking about
forty per cent, of all migrants leaving the United
Kingdom; more than any other country in the world.
And within that again, the percentage of
British children under 15 years in the migrant total
we have been receiving latterly, is greater than their
actual percentage of population in the United
Kingdom itself.
So the factors of family and youth migration
enhance the actual figures—and this is true whether
the movement is from Britain or some other country
whose people are migrating here.
While all migration brings its strength in
numbers and skills and everything else that goes
in human contribution to the life and economy of
an expanding nation, child migration has a special
leavening quality of its own; working and growing
and interacting upon, and in, a generation that is
to inherit the Australian future.
It has its price, of course, in the temporary
strains it places upon our education system. But
that is a small price to pay for the enrichment
it is giving to our whole social, cultural and
industrial life.
A million young faces in our schools —many
of them already turned to good and useful and often
brilliant careers—tell the living story more forcibly
than anyone could ever attempt to tell it in word^

Government employee can

civil service is no longer -pure

be greatly sullied by admitting

have lived-down minor offences.
By all means train prisoners
to take a useful place in
society; but, before that train-
ing can be used, society will
have to agree to forego some
of its vengeance and accept the
possibility of a criminal’s re-
formation. The lead could well
come from the Government. —

Highway Improvements
If James Mahoney (B.
29/6/’6O) takes a trip along the
Hume Highway to Goulburn
he’ll see that the Main Roads
Department is doing something
to alleviate heavy-traffic con-
ditions.
He will see widened uphill
roadways providing two-lane
traffic on steep grades immedi-
ately north of Goulburn and in
the Penrose Forest. Just north
of Marulan he’ll see the initial
works of clearing for a parallel
road about a chain east of the
existing highway ; this planned
road seems to continue for
about six to eight miles.
A welcome and necessary
replacement has been open for
some months over what was a
badly dangerous piece of road
just north of Berrima to east
of the Wombeyan Caves turn-
off; a series of short switch-
back rises has been eliminated.
Admittedly the Hume is far
short of the standard essential
for the important volume of
traffic it carries ; but let’s be
fair and give credit to a Gov-
ernment department doing its
best with the resources at its
disposal.—T. J.-Lamb (N.S.W.).
Cooktown
Tell “T.c.D.” (B. 29/6/’6O)
that it’s not wise to be ’dog-
matic about the population
°f Cooktown in its palmy
oays: the census-figures were
admitted to be unreliable by
J? e report of the Registrar-
kieneral of 1880, which sug-
gested that there had been an
rror enumerating the
P pumtion of the Palmer dis-
o in the 1876 census,
not n y fhptisands of whites,
™ counting shiploads of
Chinese, arrived from over-
seas and inter-State, but there
was a constant fluctuation of
arrivals and departures.
It is certain that many
thousands of whites, Chinese
and other races were never
included in the census-figures,
in the same way that many
thousands of pounds-worth
of gold won from the Palmer
was smuggled out of the
country and never included
in the official goldmining
returns.
The figure of 40,000 given
in Triumph in the Tropics
for Cooktown was obviously
meant to include the district.
“T.C.D.” has quoted from the
figures given for the Cook
Shire on p. 385. If he had
looked at the mining chapter,
on the relevant pages (202 to
204), he would have read:
Around the port Cooktown
sprang into existence, and within
weeks was a city of canvas tents
and slab huts, housing 5000
people. In three years 15,000.
whites and 20,000 Chinese passed
through the port travelling to the
diggings.
This was as accurate an
estimate as we could obtain ;
it is based on contemporary
reports by the “Sydney Morn-
ing Herald” and Brisbane
“Courier” representatives on
the spot, as well as J. V.
Mulligan’s reminiscences in
the “Queenslander” some
years later.
More evidence? Bailliere’s
Queensland Gazetteer and
Road Guide, published in
Melbourne in 1876, gave the
population of Cooktown in
that year as 1000 whites and
a mixed population of 7000
other races, mostly Chinese.
Pugh’s Almanac for 1880
states that even then there
were 23 hotels in Cooktown,
which suggests that “T.C.D.’s”
3500 population must have
slaked an almighty thirst.
In 1876 Bailliere lists
“Poole’s Sovereign, Pizzey’s
Royal, Burns’s Etheridge,
Coynes’s Empire and several
others.”— Clem Lack, Asso-
ciate Editor, Triumph in the
Tropics (Q).
Stonemasons
Although my own view on
the restoration of Sydney’s
G.P.O. clock-tower is that the
money could be better spent,
veracity compels me to correct
“Postscript’s” contention that
the tower could not be rebuilt
since there are no stonemasons
left in Australia who are com-
petent to carry out the work
(B. 15/6/’6O). As a matter
of fact, the City Council itself
employs such men ; so do a
number of builders and stone-


mason’s yards in and around
Sydney.
True, stonemasonry is a
fading trade, but it’s not yet
extinct. The most exquisite
and intricate stonecutting could
be done in monumental-
mason’s yards. However,
the price of such specialised
work is almost prohibitive,
since, although mechanical
tools reduce some of the labor
in stone-cutting today, they
have failed by a wide margin to
balance the rising costs of
wages.
“Postscript’s” statement that
stonemasons are as hard to
muster as authentic wheel-
wrights is perhaps about
one generation premature.
Stonemasonry has ceased
to be a subject at Sydney’s
Technical College. The occa-
sionally enrolled mason-
apprentice does his technical
training in the bricklaying
classes, where arch-, cornice-
and similar, ornamental work
can be applied to masonry.—

The Church in England
Naturally, “C.A.M.” (B,
6/7/’6O), historians differ as to
when the Church of England
really began. Anglicans, except
probably the ultra-Protestant
wing, consider the present
Church as in direct descent
from the Anglo-Saxon Church
that was founded by amalgama-
tion of the Celtic Church and
the Anglo - Saxon Roman
Church at the Synod of Whitby,
a.d. 664. In their opinion the
Church in the 16th century
merely repudiated its Papal
affiliation and introduced re-
forms that brought it back into
close relationship with the early
Church. Whether this, or Pro-
fessor Holdsworth’s claim that
“Must be a square , judging by his rig.”
it is based on “manufacturing

Of course there’s no certainty
that Henry VIII would not
have divorced Catherine if he
had reared a son or sons, but
the odds would appear greatly
against it. As so staunchly
Roman Catholic a historian as
Hilaire Belloc pointed out,
Henry was fundamentally
Catholic in doctrine to the day
of his death —“a schismatic,
not a heretic.” He had written
a defence of the Seven Sacra-
ments against Luther’s critic-
ism which won him the title
of Defender of the Faith from
Pope Leo X and abuse from
Martin Luther. Cardinal Wol-
sey and Sir Thomas More were
his principal councillors until
his quarrel with the Papacy
over his divorce alienated him
from them. His divorce of his
fourth wife, though he had a
son by his deceased third wife,
can’t justly be cited as evidence
to the contrary. Once having
taken the-step it was natural
he should repeat it when h
felt desirous of doing so. e
Pope Clement Vn Un
doubtedly acted rightly in ref Us
ing Henry's divorce. He was'
however, not one of the strong
or high-minded Popes, and it is
doubtful whether he would
have taken the stand he did
had Catherine not been auni
to the all-powerful Emperor
Charles V.
Elizabeth’s changes in doc-
trine and practice were, in the
aggregate, substantial, but were
introduced cautiously. Her
Anglican settlement was thus
summarised in Warner and
Martin’s Groundwor k o j
British History: —
The first Act was inevitable-
England would never accept the
Papal power. But once this blot
was strflck everything was done
to spare the wounded feelings of
the Catholic party. The Act of
Supremacy is far more cautious
than Henry VIII’s blunt declara-
tion that he was “Head of fc
Church,” and only office-holders
had to take the oath; the ordinal)
layman was left alone. The Prayer
Book is the Prayer Book we tot
today and no word against the
Pope is in it. Even the Litany,
which envisages a very compre-
hensive catalogue of bodily anil
ghostly perils, has nothing ata
the Pope. There was such a dans
in Edward’s Prayer Book, W
Elizabeth’s advisers struck it out

Russian Preparedness
If, as stated in the Bulletin
article “Applied Science,” Pro-
fessor John Neill Greenwood,
after visiting Russia in 1932,
asserted that Russia was one
of the few European countries
really prepared for the next
Great War, and that “events
showed that the professor was
right, or much closer to the
truth than popularly supposed,”
it would be interesting to know
why the Russians found it so
hard to cope with the German
forces that invaded Russia in
1941.
The Russians were driven
steadily back until the invaders
reached the Volga and Cauca-
sus, occupying a vast amount of
territory in European Russia.
The Russian armies, in the
main, proved to be poorly
equipped ; losses in manpower
were enormous; extensive
assistance in material had to be
supplied them by Britain and
America.
It was Hitler’s decision to
hold on at Stalingrad through
the winter, instead of allowing
his generals to withdraw to a
more practicable defensive
line, combined with pressure
by the British and Americans
in Italy and France—necessitat-
ing extensive troop and aircraft
withdrawals from the Russian
front—that enabled the Rus-
sians to make headway in the
last phase of the war. — Tom
(N.S.W.).
Union Ballots
Just how secret are union
ballots? And just how hard
would it be to rig a union elec-
tion?
Union ballot - papers are
!ssued and signed for. They
ma y n °t be numbered, but let’s
assume they are. (Some union-
rules provide for the number-
rug of ballot-papers ; but in one
case to come to my notice the
numbering was confined to the
utts from which the ballot-
Papers had been torn. This
ruay have been in the interests
0 secrecy ; but it’s hard to see
what actual purpose was served
by the numbers). With each
paper there are two envelopes,
one marked “Ballot Paper”;
the other, a larger one, is
marked “Counterfoil” or some-
thing similar, and is provided
with space in which the mem-
ber states his name and place
of employment. (Note: This is
not a signature.) The member
registers his vote on the ballot-
paper, places this in the appro-
priate envelope, seals it, places
it in the counterfoil and seals
that.
It is sometimes objected that
the name on the counterfoil
destroys secrecy. It doesn’t
necessarily, and certainly it
doesn’t if the ballot is con-
ducted honestly. The name is
required in order that the mem-
ber’s financial status can be
checked, and under the pro-
cedure usually set-down in the
rules there’s no way of connect-
ing the ballot-paper with the
counterfoil. At the count the
larger envelopes are opened
and the ballot-paper envelopes
are removed; these are not
opened until the counterfoils
have been put aside. No one
could have a clue which paper
came from which counterfoil.
The candidates are entitled
to be present at the count, and
almost invariably they are.
They may be permitted to have
a scrutineer. In any case they
are well able to ensure that
secrecy of the ballot is not en-
dangered at that stage. In
theory the system is fair and
invulnerable.
But let’s go back a bit. The
ballot-papers, having been com-
pleted and doubly sealed, are
placed in locked boxes. Where
a large group of members are
voting together, as in a big
factory, each may place his
paper in the box. But in most
unions a big proportion of the
vote comes from small groups
which don’t warrant separate
boxes ; in these cases the votes
are gathered by a rep. and
taken or forwarded to the
union office, where they are
placed in a locked box.
There’s a danger here. In an
election for secretary it’s obvi-
ous that a large—perhaps very
large—number of votes are
handled by either the retiring
secretary or his staff. In the
secrecy of the union office the
envelopes could be opened and
the ballot-papers replaced by
others favorable to the retiring
official. Here’s where that
name on the counterfoil be-
comes dangerous. Usually the
retiring man knows pretty well
who is for and against him ;
and he need open only those
envelopes which he feels sure
contain adverse votes.
Admittedly there’d be some
difficulty in securing spare
ballot-papers, but it wouldn’t
be by any means impossible,
particularly in the case of a
union with inter-State affilia-
tion, when they could be
printed in another State. Cer-
tainly any officials determined
to remain in-office would not
be hindered by lack of printed
material.
But let’s assume that every
member places his own paper
in the locked box. The return-
ing-officer holds the keys, and
let’s assume he’s honest. Voting
usually closes some time before
the count —say it closes on a
Friday and the counting is the
following Sunday. Between the
closing and the counting the
locked boxes are held in the
union office, in custody of the
retiring secretary. The return-
ing-officer retains the keys, and
he’s honest, so the ballot-papers
are secure.
But are they? Some time
previously there had been an
election for some other oflice.
Often secretarial ballots are
held triennially, those for presi-
dent annually. At the last
presidential election the secre-
tary was returning-officer, and
then he held the keys. Prob-
ably he holds them between
elections. Maybe he didn’t
have duplicates cut, but there
was nothing to prevent him.
That’s the situation which
can exist almost wherever it’s
wanted. The retiring secretary
has access to all the papers and
has at least 36 hours in which
to make certain of his election.
(Here again th~ on
counterfoil gives him a decided
advantage.) If he doesn't take
the opportunity it’s because he’s
honest or cocksure of election,
or the job isn’t worth the
effort.
I’m n< t suggesting all union
ballots a ft rigged. I’m saying
the majority of them could be ;
and the danger to unionism and
Australia is real enough to
warrant the effort to make,
court-c Mled o.llois
lar or compulsory.
All that’s needed is to make
them free. It wouldn’t be a
great cost to the country, be-
cause most of the machinery is
available in the various elec-
toral offices. But now the cost
of a court-controlled ballot to
a union is inexplicably heavy.
If the Governments would bear
that cost, union ballots would
automatically come under con-
trol of the courts. Then they’d
be secret and honest. And,
what’s more, we’d know they
were.— Pieter Nuyts (W.A.).
Lords and Ladies
In his article on “The Caseys
and ,The Cottons” (B. 6/7/’6O)
Alec Chisholm is mistaken in
referring to “Lord Dick” and
“Lady Maie.” These titles
could apply only if Lord Casey
had been born a member of
the English aristocracy of the
highest rank and Lady Casey
had been the daughter of an
Earl, or a countess in her own
right.
I’ve been told that one of
our politicians who had been
knighted at the beginning of
this century gave instructions
to have “Lady Caroline Blank”
engraved on his wife’s tomb-
stone. If true it was a ridicu-
lous mistake on his part. “Caro-
line Lady Blank” might have
been permissible, but “Caroline
wife of John Blank” would
have been indisputably correct.

THE MAN ON
THE LAND
"DON'T WORRY I'M SENDING IT TO
GRAZCOS."
RURAL ECONOMICS
From “RUDDIGORE”
'T'he problem of small farmers
has often been emphasised
in these pages ; people tend to
forget what must happen to
their farms. In time they must
be integrated with larger ones
to form economic units. That
trend has started, and the cost-
price squeeze will accentuate it.
Unless this land is looked
after now, it won't be much
good when combined with
other farms. Soil-erosion, de-
pleted fertility, weeds and all
the other ills that follow im-
proper usage will have taken
such a grip that it will cost a
fortune to bring this land back
to production. Can a country
relying predominantly on agri-
culture allow this to happen?
History has taught that no
nation, whatever its size, can
afford to neglect even the
smallest area. Australia may
have more land now than it
can poke a stick at; but that
won’t always be the case. Con-
sider the amount of land that
According to reliable
sources wool advertise-
ments in Japan are

ment, which gives them

creasing. It was also
reported that on dis-
play in the Australian
pavilion at the Osaka
trade fair was a travel
wardrobe for a man
and woman made from
lightweight wool which
was resilient to creases,

Reliable sources also
state the benefits derived
from the use of Elas-
trator Green Rubber

fashioned methods such

of blood.
will be needed to feed the
population in 50 or 100 years’
time as well as maintaining
exports. Then think of the
cost of restoring exhausted
land. Experience in the U.S.
dustbowls has shown that it is
now taking $5 to repair what
could have been prevented by
the expenditure of $1 when
the trouble first started.
This makes me wonder if
some of the money now being
handed around • big-heartedly
could not be used to better
advantage. Wouldn’t it be
better to use some of it to keep
the land alive today
Such an idea might mean a
certain amount of Govern-
ment control through State
Departments delegated to the
job, but that would be no great
disadvantage. Australian agri-
cultural scientists have shown
themselves practical, down-to-
earth men who go out and get
the job done. In this they
differ from some of the
“experts” who sit behind
closed doors and try to con-
trol affairs of State by means
of heavy chunks of theory,
mostly untried. There are
enough agricultural scientists
to do the job so long as they
aren’t fettered by dozens of
routine reports that no one
reads and by everyday adminis-
tration that could be done by
clerks.
There will be plenty who
will say: “What are the pre-
sent owners of this land
doing? Why aren’t they look-
ing after the soil?” The
answer is: “Many can't
afford to!”
Fertilisers cost money, and
the same goes for such things
as building contour-banks or
controlling bracken. Farms
aren’t normally large enough
to allow any plan for fallow-
ing. There isn’t enough acreage
to allow part to be planted with
grass and spelled. Every
square-yard must be cropped
to provide a reasonable living,
and then, after expenses are
met, there’s rarely enough left
to put anything aside. Crop-
rotation and fallow cannot be
practised. The only way out
is expensive—and that the
farmer can’t afford.
It’s the land—not so much
the man —that must be helped.
I don’t mean that a farmer is
entitled to wagonloads of free
superphosphate delivered to
his property every month, or
that he should have a D-4,
complete with blade, stationed
on his farm from one year’s end
to another.
What I do mean is that assist-
ance should be given to control
soR-erosion, where needed, on
a district basis. Those who
can afford to pay should be
expected to do so ; those who
can’t should have the work
done by Government grant
with the debt made a charge
against their farms. The same
applies to fertiliser.
Better care of the land
would result in better crops
more milk, heavier yields of
grain and more pigs. The
marginal increase in income
could be earmarked to pay-off
assistance provided. If the
farm were sold the money
could be deducted from the
sale of the property.
To many this will smack of
collectivism and Government
interference. But it must not
be forgotten that no one has
the right to neglect the wel-
fare of the soil and leave future
generations to pay the penalty.
All have the right to live on
the land, but not by neglecting
the soil which will have to
provide sustenance for those to
come as much as it has for us.
Study of agricultural policy
in countries older than ours
will show that elsewhere land-
exploitation is now restrained
by law. Not only in Com-
munist countries but in Eng-
land and most of Europe and
the East people have recog-
nised that they must preserve
the soil.
A similar scheme for this
country would need the co-
operation of Agricultural De-
partments and farmers’ groups,
and would have to be run
economically. There would
always be a danger that some
might press fof funds to pre-
serve land for an unsuitable
purpose. It would also be im-
perative that assisted farmers
should repay the money spent
on their land ; but it’s no .
good expecting a farmer
already struggling on a small
farm to be able to repay a loan
immediately. On the other
hand, he should not expect
something for nothing, because
he is not entitled to it.
Whichever way you look at r
it, the preservation of the soil
on which Australia’s wealth de-
pends is no easy problem;
before long it will be costly,
and we may not be able to
afford to solve it later on. If
we don’t maintain the source
of our national income we may
not have the land to provide it

REPORT FROM CROHAMHURST
(7/7/’60)
Queensland should have reasonably good rains in the
coastal, the central highlands, Darling Downs, Maranoa and
Warrego areas during August, although falls are likely
to be poor elsewhere in the State. Patchy rainfall should
follow until November, when widespread good rains are
indicated.
In N.S.W. reasonably ..good rains should be received
'on coastal and tablelands areas and in the north-west during
August, with light to moderate rains elsewhere. Rains are
also likely to range from light to moderate in September
and October, with good general rains during November.
Victoria is likely to have moderate patchy rains during
August, although fairly gqod rains are indicated in east-
central, north-east and west-coastal areas. Good general
rains should occur in September, but falls will probably
be patchy for the rest of the year.
Moderate rain is indicated for the agricultural areas of
South Australia during August; poor in the interior. Reason-
ably good rains should be received in the agricultural areas
in September
In Western Australia light to moderate patchy rains
are likely in the south-west agricultural areas during August.
Conditions will probably be dry in the Kimberleys and north-
west, with light patchy rains elsewhere.

toxins of a bacterial organism
which thrives in decomposing
matter. The germs are widely
distributed by nature, but, un-
like most similar organisms,
they do not multiply in the
victim. The disease appears
only in fowls which eat
material containing the toxins.
The poison is so powerful that
minute quantities are enough
to cause death.
Rats or chickens which die in
out-of-the-way corners or have
been overlooked in cleaning-
up are one source of danger ;
decaying matter in stagnant
water is another. Care is needed
in feeding tinned-meat because
it spoils quickly. If it is not
fit for human consumption it
b 7' .rally not fit for fowls,
en 'vi.
Treatment of fowls in"* ad-
vanced stages of the disease is
of little value. If an outbreak
occurs consult a vet. and
remove all possible sources of
danger.
Herd-recording
“Myall”: A man who keeps
herd-records is in the best
position to increase his profits.
Here is a typical example:
A Queensland farmer had
been recording for about three
years when he decided to cull
his low-producers. In March,
1957, just before the drought
set-in, he sold 20 of his herd
of 60 at satisfactory prices.
With only 40 head to provide
for during the drought, and
with the proceeds of the culls
to use if necessary, he came
through without the loss of
any cattle. The year’s pro-
duction from the 40 selected
cows was just below that
obtained from 60 head in the
previous 12 months.
From herd-records a dairy-
man can select replacements
which will build-up the milk-
yielding ability of the herd,
because milk-yielding is in-
herited. He also gets proof
of the herd-improving quali-
ties of his bull. A bull siring
low-producers soon has disas-
trous effects on the herd.
About 12 years ago the
Queensland Agricultural
Department started a herd-
recording system under which
groups of recording farmers
each have an appointed
recording-officer whose duty
is to weigh, sample and test
the milk from every cow in
each herd. More than 1200
dairyfarmers are now enrolled,
and it has been found that
group herd-recording leads to
friendly competition between
members in each group, and
this acts as an incentive to
improve herds.
There’s no point in having
cows capable of producing
4001 b. of butterfat a year if
they are only fed enough to
yield 1501 b., and under the
herd-recording group-system
herd-owners start on pasture-
improvement, improved herd-
management and better fodder-
conservation, and the result is
reflected in increased pro-
duction. As an example, one
“ —and now the bucket, Mum.”
dairyfarmer has lifted the
average production of cows
in his herd from 1131 b. a year
to 2181 b. In four years this
is an increase of 93 per cent.
Every dairyman cannot expect
to do this, but even an annual
increase of 15 per cent, is
worth while.
During the 1957-58 drought
Queensland’s dairy-production
fell by more than 40 per cent.,
yet some farmers actually
increased their returns. One
of these began recording in
1950, soon realised it was more
profitable to milk a smaller
number of high-producing
cows than to have a large
number of mediocre animals,
and by rigorous culling and
careful selection of replace-
ments established an improved
herd. To provide a higher
standard of nutrition he laid-
down ai limited area of irri-
gated pasture and planned a
regular haymaking-programme.
His herd was regulated to
calve in August and Septem-
ber. As a result of this
improved husbandry, produc-
tion of butter during the
drought was 13 per cent,
higher than for the previous
year. Not only was more
butter produced but there were
no cattle losses and no money
was spent on fodder. At the
end of the drought his cows
were in first-class condition
and able to exploit the fresh
growth of grass, while there
was still a reserve of lucerne-
hay and maize.
On the Darling Downs,
around Bell and Maclagen,
herd-recording groups show
steady progress. At Bell they
have increased butterfat-
production to 1841 b. a cow
for 1958-59, compared with
1501 b. a cow in 1953, the first
recording year. The Mac-
lagen group has just com-
pleted its first recording year
and the average production
of 1781 b. of butterfat a cow
shows that good progress is
being made in this area, too.
Purebred dairy-herds are
being recorded in increasing
numbers, and 331 (about 2?
per cent, of the State’s total)
are now under test. Last year
the production of 1936 cows
was recorded and this will be
increased to about 2400 duriiw

Qualify Wheat
“M’Lou”: The weight
appearance and 14.3 per cent
protein-content of his sample
of Olympic wheat won first
place for D. Loats in the
Rupanyup (Vic.) wheat-quality
competition held in conjunc-
tion with the district’s 1959.
crop competition.
The record protein-content
was partly due to the fertility
of soil which, although in.
tensively cropped for years,
had benefited by being under
barrel - medic from 1955 to
1957.
Another contributing factor
was 1959’s seasonal conditions,
which thinned crops and res-
tricted starch-formation during
the wheat’s later ripening
stages.
Griller Feeding
“Ess-Ay”: Trials at Parafield
(S.A.) have confirmed 50 per
cent, protein-meatmeal as the
ideal and most economic
griller-ration.
A. A. McArdle, of the
Department of Agriculture,
who supervised the tests, says
a ration of 40 per cent, meat-
meal does not increase losses
in rearing, but does reduce
growth by about 23 per cent,
Hence, this scale isn’t recom-
mended for chickens, though ■
there’s no evidence that it’s not
effective for laying-stock.
The two groups each received
the departmental high-energy
all-mash griller-ration of 501 b.
crushed wheat, 101 b. crushed
barley, 71b. crushed oats, 221 h

Boosting Sales
of Lamb
“R.R.D.”: Just back from
n study-tour of the U-S.A.
Ld Canada, G. B. Richard-
.on immediate past-president
of the N.S.W. branch of the
Australian Society of Breeders
0 f British Sheep, reported:
“We have quite a lot to
learn in the presentation of
our products to the consum-
ing public. For that reason
W e must all pull our weight
in supporting better pro-
motion and presentation of
our great sheep, wool and
lamb industries.”
He went on to say that
sheepbreeders know the
value of careful preparation
of livestock for show and
sales, but it is important to
follow this up with proper
marketing.
Recent legislation giving
the Meat Board freedom to
promote meat in Australia
meant, he said, that all meat-
interests wo'.dd support
marketing by advertising
their own products. Turn-
ing to the particular aspect
of sale of lamb-meat, he sug-
gested that information on
the best methods of cooking
various lamb-cuts should be
publicised.
Fibrefeoard
Fruit-cases
“Fruit-Cocky”: Probably we
still put-up with the familiar
wooden fruit-case because it
seems always to have been with
us. It does the job, although
basically unsuitable for its pur-
pose. Even to pack it you
need considerable skill and ex-
perience. And it’s a miracle,
after the final punishment of
the lidding-press, that any fruit
Manages to reach market
undamaged.
Fibreboard containers have
now been generally adopted in
uae U.S.A., but in Australia
most growers are still sticking
t° the timber.
fn a way, that’s not so sur-
pnsing; it’s not often an inno-
vation has so many advantages
and disadvantages.
Using the “tray - pack”
oarton, speed of packing can
e doubled and you need
°nty unskilled labor or
machinery. Costly strawboards
nd wraps are no longer neces-
ary > w hde lidding and nailing-
down are done away with, be-
cause the container is in two
telescopic halves —a gift from
the gods for pilferers, unfor-
tunately.
Still, many retailers report
how well these cartons open-
up —trays ready for immediate
display, no bruised fruit, no
finishing -up knee - deep in
wrapping-paper.
So far its advantages seem
to put the new-style container
well in the lead. But, once
emptied, the wooden case is a
source of revenue to the re-
tailer. The cardboard con-
tainer seems to have only one
life, whereas a pine-case could
make anything up to half-a-
dozen trips to market before
being finally liquidated. A
grower with facilities for
handling used cases can make a
clear saving of Is. or 2s. a case
each trip. Over the whole
industry this could represent
many thousands of pounds, a
saving which would vanish if
fibreboard-boxes came in, be-
cause the first cost of the two
4ypes is about equal.
Another serious drawback to
the carton is that, not being
very rigid, it cannot be stacked
nearly as high as the wooden
box. City market-agents, who
pay big rentals for floor-space,
dislike this. Carriers complain
about the same thing, and also
say that the carton makes a
sloppy load. Growers may
regard these objections as other
fellow’s problems, but stacking
difficulties can also come home
to roost in shed and cool-store.
Attempts are being made to
improve the water-proofing of
fibreboard cases so that they
can resist condensation in cool-
store and showers in the pad-
dock. It may be possible, also,
to impregnate trays and do
aw r ay with the need for oil-
wraps in cool-store.
On the whole, there’s little
doubt that the fibreboard case
is on the way in, but it’s vital
to watch every penny today, so
growers are wise to be cautious.
Tranquilliser-guns
“Wilga”: Tranquilliser-guns
and -pistols for handling un-
manageable cattle and
“scrubbers” in wild and
dangerous country are now
available' in Queensland.
The gun, 3ft. long, has - a
range of 50yds., and the pistol,
one of 15yds. Both are
powered by compressed-air
and fire a drug-syringe con-
taining nicotine alkaloid,
which automatically discharges
on impact.
A teaspoonful of the
alkaloid shot into a snorting
half-ton scrub-bull will make
him docile in 40 seconds, and,
properly handled, the drug
does not harm the beast in
any way.
Guns sell at £92 each and
pistols -at £65, while the
“bullets” cost 4s. a round.
Members of the United
Graziers’ Association were
concerned about the introduc-
tion of these weapons in case
they got into wrong hands.
Cattle - duffing has become
prevalent in parts of the State,
and tranquillisers would help
thieves in dealing with wild
animals. They have now been
assured by the Commissioner
of Police that strict controls
are being kept on the sale of
guns and pistols.
When a gun or pistol is
sold, the police must be noti-
fied of its serial number, and
name and address of the pur-
chaser. Pistols are licensed
by the police under the law
on concealable weapons.
Drugs used in the guns will
only be supplied on a veterin-
ary prescription.
The agents for the gun have
presented the veterinary-
science faculty at the Queens-
land Uni. with a £750 kit of
equipment for use in tuition
and research.

How to cure dates for eating.
The dates should be ripe but
still fairly firm. Remove them
carefully from the stalks, keeping
the calyx intact on each fruit.
Place in a colander or muslin bag
and dip qdickly in and out ot
boiling water to kill parasites,
etc. Spread out thinly on clean
white paper and dry off moisture,
but not in full sunshine. Turn
them about, and finally dry-out in
a very slow oven with the door
slightly open. When sufficiently
cured store in air-tight jars in a
cool place. If you are compelled
to pick them while still green and
hard, they may be slightly cooked
in water before re-drying. Another
process is to preserve them in jars
as with fruit-preserving in the
kitchen.

Life and career of Admiral Sir
Guy Gaunt.
Sir Guy Gaunt was born in
1869 in Melbourne, the son of
Judge W. H. Gaunt. He was
educated at Melbourne Grammar
and at H.M.S. Worcester. In
1889, as a lieutenant-commander,
he commanded the detachment
that defended the British Consulate
at Apia, in Samoa, during the
attack by Samoan rebels; in the
military operations that followed
he raised and commanded
“Gaunt’s Brigade,” was mentioned
in dispatches and promoted com-
mander. During the Russo-
Japanese war he was on the China
Station in command of H.M.S.
Vengeance. In World War I he
was British Naval Attache in
Washington, and had a dis-
tinguished career in Naval Intelli-
gence. He was promoted rear-
admiral in 1918, when he retired,
vice-admiral-retired in 1924, and
admiral-retired in 1928. In 1922
he became member for Buckrose
in the House of Commons, a seat
which he held until 1926.

What is the origin of the myth
of Atlantis ?
Atlantis is described by Plato
in the Timceus, where he states
that Solon was told of it by an
Egyptian priest, and that it had
been submerged 9000 years pre-
viously in punishment for its
impiety in waging war against
Athens. A shoal of mud was
supposed to mark its site. It has
been identified with the Canaries,
America and Scandinavia, but it
is probably only a Greek form of
the fabled Celtic Isles of the Dead,
always placed in the West Atlantic.

What is the Scartwater Trust
and how did it originate ?
When the Queensland Govern-
ment was throwing-open large
areas of grazing land for selection,
Arthur Cunningham, a Queensland
grazier, persuaded it to grant an
area of about 280 square-miles,
some 200 miles inland from
Bowen, for the benefit ot ex-
servicemen. He obtained gifts of
money and stock, and set-up a
trust of which he was managing-
trustee.
Under the terms of the trust,
Scartwater station is run by, and
profits, ex-servicemen and their
dependants in the north-west of
Queensland. The trust has assisted
veterans of both wars to purchase
farms and equipment and estab-
lish themselves in trades and pro-
fessions, and provides scholarships
for their children.

some of her ditties without
paying cover-charge Roulette
offers More Songs for Adults
Only (RL 25101). Pearlie
Mae lets herself go in such
numbers as “The Great In-
doors,” “Love for Sale,”
“Aggravatin’ Papa,” “T h e
Duchess Threw Her Crutches

In contrast to night-club
sophistication comes “A Friend
We Have” (T 1272 from Capi-
tol), on which Tennessee Ernie
Ford and The Jordanaires
have recorded a dozen of the
gospel hymns of the Deep
South. The Jordanaires quar-
tet have made disks of their
own. Ernie Ford is best known
in America for folksy-religious
songs such as those in this
collection —“O Come, Angel
Band,” “When I Reach That
City” and “Drifting Too Far
From The Shore.” Jack Fas-
cinato arrangements alternate
piano, celeste and organ with
bass and guitar.

An R.C.A. Batch
A world-famous baritone
and an equally-celebrated
dramatic tenor are featured
among the latest releases
under this trade-mark. In
John Charles Thomas Sings
(CAM 29) the burly American
puts his resonant voice to the
service of sentiment (as repre-
sented by “Oh, What a Beauti-
ful Morning”), comedy (“The
Green-eyed Dragon”) and
devotion (“The Lord’s
Prayer”), with “OP Man River”
and a few others interspersed.
This is a Thomas collection
that should be enjoyed by
Three Ballet Suites
Columbia has impressed on
the one disk (330CX 7517)
suites from Tschaikowsky’s two
best-known ballets: Swan Lake
and Sleeping Beauty, and the
five movements of each repre-
sent the most attractive num-
bers in each work. The oboe
piquantly states Odette’s theme;
the music covering the dancing
of Odette, the corps de ballet
and the four cygnets in Act II
follow, and the suite is wound-
up with the .rhythmic exhilara-
tion of the Hungarian Csardas
of Act 111. The “Sleeping
Beauty” numbers comprise the
Introduction, the Act I Adagio,
the Puss - in - Boots episode,
Panorama,” and the Famous
Waltz of the Flowers.” In
total, 80 minutes of some of
the lushest melodies ever de-
vised to lure a ballerina into
tights, and played most hand-
somely by the Philharmonia
orchestra under von Karajan.
The third ballet, of a totally
itrerent order, is Roussel’s
Menus and Ariadne. The

In Varied Mood
Wilbur Kentwell’s organ-
playing has been well known
on Australian radio for many,
many years. Spring Is Here (a
little ahead of the calendar), a
Columbia l.p. record (330SX-
-7624), features him at the
Hammond organ, supported by
Cyril Bevan’s drums, in a selec-
tion of songs from Rodgers-
and-Hart musicals. Between
1925 and 1943 R- and H. wrote
the music and lyrics for 23
stage shows and more than a
dozen films. Kentwell’s key-
board pleasantly recaptures
memories of most of them—
from “Manhattan,” the hit-
song of “Garrick Gaieties”
(1925), the pair’s first success,
to “Zip” arid “I Could Write
a Book,” the sophisticated
numbers from “Pal Joey”
(1940). The 12 tracks cover
snippets of 50 songs.
Pearl Bailey is famous for
the type of song night-club
addicts go for in a big way as
the evening wears on. For
those who have heard
him in the flesh. In The
Lighter Side of Lauritz Mel-
chior (CAM 27) the tenor puts
aside his usual Wagnerian
vocal heavyweights to toss
around qbout a dozen
featherweights from films and
musicomedies, and some art-
songs, all led-off by the
“Serenade” from “The Student
Prince” —and in all of them
the vital quality of his robust
tenor is shaped and spun to
suit the songs.
Under the title The French
Touch (L 16227) Charles
Munch, with the Boston Sym-
phony, has collected a trio of
the most attractive short-long
orchestral pieces in the Gallic
mode of programme-music.
Dukas, in his “Sorcerer’s
Apprentice,” offers wit in a
score alive with color ; Saint-
Saens in “Omphale’s Spinning-
wheel” uses his rhythms bril-
liantly ; Ravel’s fairytale-music
in the “Mother Goose Suite” is
a stock piece in every big
orchestra. It offers rich evoca-
tion with Munch at the helm.

Glenn Gould Again
This virile pianist, who has
already recorded Beethoven’s
first two concertos for Coronet,
has now followed these with
Beethoven Piano Concerto No.
3 (KLC 2724). Though less
profound than the final two,
the Third has distinguished
melodies, and a rondo full of
joviality. It can’t be left out
of any library. Bernstein and
the Columbia Symphony
Orchestra collaborate.


Women's Letters
SYDNEY
There was great to-and-fro at Leo
Buring’s wine - cellars on Wednesday,
round about the cocktail-hour. On the
one hand managing-director Tom Mead
hosted a wine-tasting in honor of the
cellars’ new gallery, which features a
mural by Bill Pidgeon. On the other was
an Elizabethan party at which the Arts’
Council toasted the John Alden Shak-
speare season —in sack (which is very like
a dry sherry). Guests seemed to oscillate
between the two parties, and it was all
very pleasant.
At the Shakspeare party Dorothy
Helmrich, Arts Council president, wel-
comed a great gathering of press and
theatre people who ate mince-pies and
strawberry-tarts with their sack, sipped
from the Loving Cup (hygienically with
a glass), gazed on the boar’s head (papier
mache) and hacked Tudor-sized hunks
of bread from the yard-long loaves. There
was a good deal of glamor in the
assembly, which included cast-members
Elaine Montgomerie, Gaie Jordan and
Christine Clayton and, of course, John
Alden, who made the mightiest speech
of the evening. His production of
“Twelfth Night” is at the Conservatorium
this week ; at the Independent next week.
Then at the other party there was Clive
Morse to be met and his first book The
Guest Years of My Life, published
that very day by Angus and Robertson,
to be toasted. Norma Morse and her
mother and father (Mr. and Mrs. Fred
Jones, of Mosman) were also there, and
it was interesting to hear that Mrs. Jones
is the Thelma Jones who has done so
much good work for the Mosman
Musical Society. The Guest Years of
My Life is an amusing account of the
Morses’ two years managing the hotel at
Talbingo (N.S.W.). They now live at
Turramurra, and Clive is an advertising
big-wig, but they cast many a longing,
backward look at their life in a country
town.

A hatful of violets, tied with an apple-
green ribbon, was the charming presen-
tation made to Miss Bunty Turner by
the Flower Club of N.S.W. when she
opened their camellia show at David
Jones’ during the week. As Eliza is the
flower-seller in “My Fair Lady,” the gift
was also most appropriate. The show
was in aid of the Kuringai Truby King
Mobile Clinic, and there were 700 pre-
sent at the opening—a great tribute to the
enthusiasm of the North Shore Line
people, for the rain pelted down that
afternoon at the rate of 4in. in three
hours and only the dedicated and the
reporters would have thought of going
out! Mrs. T. Arlom, president of the
Flower Club, introduced Miss Turner ;
Mrs. E. G. Waterhouse thanked her.
Robin Bailey, star of “My Fair Lady,”
was present, and Lady Lloyd Jones caught
the eye in a lilac velour hat and a chin-
chilla cape.
Miss Evelyn Wood, well-known Sydney
producer with many excellent shows to
her credit, is presenting “The Party,” by
Jane Arden, at the Genesian Theatre for
a season opening on Friday, July 22. Miss
Wood chose this play, which was voted
the Best ,Play of the Year (1958) and
was used by Charles Laughton for his
return to the stage after 20 years. John
O’Hanlon will be playing the leading role
in Sydney. This will be the first Aus-
tralian production.
When Elizabeth Reynolds married
Adrian Mclnnes at St. James Church
recently they both represented families

Elizabeth is the younger daughter of Mr.

eldest son of Mr. and Mrs. T. W.
Mclnnes. Cecily Ross (Holbrook) and
Robin Reynolds were bridesmaids in
frosted-green delustred-satin. The bride
wore classic white satin. Among the
guests at the reception at Amory were
Rev. A. Austin and Mrs. Austin
(Blayney), Mr. and Mrs. Alister Ross

“Something French” was interpreted in
many ways at the Gaie Nuit at Prunier’s
organised by the social-committee of the
Deaf and Blind Children’s Institution.
President Mrs. Bill White was all frou-
frou, ostrich-feathers and black spangles,
Mrs. Jack Farrington was a spruced-up
Montmartre-type in cinnamon-and-black
stripes, Mrs. Ron Macdonald used
French scent with a black velvet dress
from Lanvin, Mr. and Mrs. John R e y.
mond cheated a little by claiming that
their name was their French card-of-
entrance, Mrs. Bill Christie wore ruby
velvet topped with a soft white voiumin-
ous coat, and Mrs. Alex Slutzkin decor-
ated her really pink hair with cream
aigrettes.. A very pretty fashion-note was
the red rose embroidered on the pencil-
heels of Mrs. Allan Paterson’s black-and-
silver beaded shoes, which matched her
handbag.

Roslyn Dunbar and Barry Strong, who
play the leads in “The Marriage of
Figaro’’ for the Stage Club Opera School,
announced their engagement at the per’
formance on Saturday night, thus demon-
strating, according to producer Douglas
Parnell, the spirit of co-operation in the
cast. The school has 25 carefully chosen
students, all of whom are given an
opportunity of singing the lead in one of
three operas during the year. “Butter- J
fly” will be produced in December and J
“Faust” in February, and will be aval 1

MELBOURNE
Thp originality and beauty of the
decorations for the Lord Mayor’s Ball
t the Town Hall provided a talkmg-
nnint for the 2000 guests. The theme was
Melbourne in 1860, and the ill-fated
RMrke and Wills expedition. The stage
zL S et with a large gold frame in which
two colored reproductions of Australian
naintings were interchanged with dif-
ferent lighting-effects. One picture was
a bush scene; the other the well-
known painting of Melbourne in
IMO looking up Swanston Street from
Princes Bridge, with St. Paul’s Cathedral
on one side, an hotel on the other, and
open paddocks in the background. At
one side of the huge frame was a repro-
duction of the Burke and Wills statue
in Spring Street, and on the other a map
of Australia, a string of lights depicting
the route of the expedition, from Mel-
bourne to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Be-
neath was the legend: Burke and Wills,
King and Gray, 1860. In front of the
pictures were terraces banked high with
potted cyclamens, coleus, primulas,
poinsettias and begonias in glowing
colors, set in tiers of greenery.
A fanfare of trumpets announced the
arrival of the Lord Mayor and Lady
Mayoress, Lieut.-Governor Sir Edmund
Herring and Dame Mary Herring, the
Premier and Mrs. Henry Bolte, Federal
Treasurer Harold Holt, Mrs. Holt, and
Town Clerk F. Rogan and Mrs. Rogan.
Dame Mary chose a full-length gown of
oyster-toned brocade patterned in deep-
green and gold. The Lady Mayoress
chose a sheath-gown of pale-pink Chan-
tilly-lace, with a bouffant overskirt of
lace and tulle falling at the back from
the hip-line. The bodice was high in
front and deeply cut at the back. Mrs.
Holt looked smart in a slim gown of
lipstick-pink satin. Pervenche-blue re-
embroidered-lace embroidered in crystal
beads and pearls was chosen by Mrs.
Bolte. Mrs. Rogan’s wide-skirted gown
was of apricot satin, and her chiffon
stole was in the same rich color.
The two daughters of Cr. and Mrs.
Evans were there: Mrs. Louis Sallman
in a gown highlighted with primrose and
white drapings, caught at the back by
a P°sy of flowers matching the green
of the organza ; and Margot Evans, who
chose a bouffant gown of lipstick-pink
lace, with pearls and beads trimming the
deep-necked bodice. Mrs. Ronald Evans
chose a sheath-gown of jade-green
brocade heavily encrusted with pearls.
Ann Curtis pinned two large pink roses
in the strapless bodice of her white
draped chiffon gown. Sandra Shipton
ad hly-of-the-valley in the bodice of her
Sown. Carole Visbord had pink roses
ustered in the strapless bodice of her

1 - ac inths at the neckline of her
mist-blue chiffons.

Skinner and Cyril
brief but amusing
speeches when they were guests at a
luncheon given in their honor by the
English Speaking Union. Miss Skinner
said, inter alia, that she was glad the
U.S., despite George Bernard Shaw, was
regarded as an English-speaking country.
Cyril Ritchard told the story of an
English courier taking a bus-load of
tourists through the wine-country of
Germany. “Shortly,” he told the tourists,
“you will see the Rhine.” Upon which
an Australian put his head out the
window and said “Rubbish! There isn’t
a cloud in the sky!” Guests were re-
ceived by association president Sir Owen
Dixon and Lady Dixon, the latter wear-
ing a teal-blue woollen suit and a sable-
brown toque misted with veiling. .Miss
Skinner, who was accompanied by her
husband, Mr. Alden Blodgett, chose a
suit of steel-grey tweed, her attractive
headgear comprising a roll of cerise
velvet finished with black veiling. Others
at the official table included U.S. Consul
William J. Ryan and Mrs. Ryan (her
attractive white beehive hat, latticed with
black velvet, was worn with a black suit),
Major-General Sir Kingsley Norris and
Lady Norris, Dr. W. K. Braun (he is
the U.S. Cultural Affairs Officer) and
Mrs. Braun, Mr. I. R. Hall of the U.K.
Information Office, Mrs. Max Dietrich,
Miss Dorothy Coles (chairman of the
E.S.U. activities-committee), Mrs. W.
Dobbinson, Mrs. J. McGuigan and
Charles Dearden, of J.C.W.’s.
To celebrate the engagement of their
daughter Sandra Isabel, Mr. and Mrs.
Liel Pizzey, of Toorak, entertained at a
buffet-dinner followed by dancing at
their home. Sandra is their only
daughter, and her fiance is John Richard,
elder son of Mr. and Mrs. J. Journeaux,
of East St. Kilda. Educated at
S.C.E.G.G.S., she went on to Inver-
gowrie and is now receptionist for
Bernard Evans and Partners, architects.
Sandra’s sports are tennis and swimming.
John, an Old Melburnian, is with his
father’s firm of sharebrokers. The
wedding is planned for early next year.
At the dance given by her parents
Sandra wore a sheath-frock of midnight-
blue lace, her mother a short frock which
combined beige lace and pure-silk taffeta.
John’s parents were at the party, Mrs.
Journeaux wearing a skirt of black faille
with a pale-blue jersey off-the-shoulder
blouse. Among the guests were Margaret
Bett (she will be chief bridesmaid), who
chose a smart frock of blue velvet,
Margot Evans, Jennie Latreille, Lindy
Challingsworth, Katherine A’Beckett,
Denise O’Halloran, Andrea Andrews and
Virginia Campbell.

man was her granddaughter, Anne Freed-
man, who covered her white organza
frock with a coat of vieux-rose wool.
A striking frock of black guipure-lace
made over gold taffeta was chosen by
Mrs. Norman Lynch. Mrs. George
Laurens’s pastel-blue satins were em-
broidered with silver beads. Mrs. Gordon

An Island Novel
In his new novel White Man’s Shoes
(Macdonald) Olaf Ruhen sets his scene
on a Pacific island and describes how
the Government’s decision to encour-
age natives to become little capitalists
affects Melanesians and Australians.
Keno Dogami, a native pearl-trader
of unusual strength and ability, is
helped by Bert Selden, the Government
administrator, to overcome white com-
petition around his home-island..Selden,
capable and conscientious finds himself
caught-up in Keno’s ruthless scheming,
so that he either cannot or will riot see
that he has fostered a little dictator.
Keno, the defects of his qualities upper-
most, becomes as bad as the old white
traders, runs an illicit traffic in liquor
and expects seignorial rights among
the women.
In his clearly-drawn portraits of the
whites—Selden; Fran Kittway, the
attractive schoolmistress; and Harry
Wolf, the shy, crippled mission-worker
—the author shows the dilemma of
those who, uncertain of the values of
their own civilisation, try to introduce
new ideas to people bred from sterner,
less-inhibited stock.
The moral is plain and the story full
of action.
R. G.
Lord Derby
Randolph Churchill’s Lord Derby
(Heinemann) is the biography of one
of the last of the great English land-
owners —he had a rent-roll of £300,000
a year.
He came into his great inheritance in
1908 at the age of 43. How great it
was may be imagined by the fact that
his grandfather, the fifteenth earl, had
been offered the throne of Greece, but
refused it because he preferred Knows-
ley, where at the time of the Grand
National, when the King and Queen
came to stay, there were “40 to eat in
the dining-room, 60 in the Steward’s
Room and 60 in the servants’ hall.” His
uncle when he died had left £62,000
to be divided between his 727 servants,
gardeners and estate-office staff. At
Knowsley and throughout his county,
at his London house and at New-
market, Lord Derby upheld this semi-
royal estate all his life.
The book describes the Parliament
Act crisis of 1910-11; War I and Lord
Derby’s service first as Director-
General of Recruiting (“the most effici-
ent recruiting-sergeant in England”),
then as Secretary of State for War
during the bitter dispute between Lloyd
George and the General Staff. It traces
his later career as Ambassador to
France and again Secretary of State
for War and gives a clear and accurate
account of British political manoeuvring
in the 19205.
Throughout this long scholarly work
—it is admirably indexed and well-
illustrated with photographs the
author has never lost sight of the down-
to-earth figure that Lord Derby was;
nor, in the account of his political
career, has he forgotten what was his
hero’s other ambition —to build-up a
great racing-stable and stud.
French and English
Enid Starkie’s book on “the influ-
ence of France on English Literature,
1851-1939,” From Gautier to Eliot
(Hutchinson), compresses quite a lot of
interesting stuff by the way; Tennyson’s
opinion (“the filthiest thing”) of a love-
sonnet by Rossetti; the gauntlfet Swin-
burne had to run. book by book; the
prosecution of Zola’s English pub-
lishers.
The tangle of French influences
during the second half of last century
—the Symbolist school of Baudelaire,
the Naturalist school of Zola, the
Parnassian school of Heredia, etc.,
which edged-off into the decadent
school of Huysmans produced
English copies which today are often
laughable; some of Swinburne’s direr
efforts to be damned, for instance,
or George Moore’s description of
materials being bought for court
dresses:—
Lengths of white silk clear as the
notes of violins played in a minor
key; white poplin falling in folds
statuesque as the bass of a fugue
by Bach.... blue turquoise faille
fanciful as the tinkling of a guitar
twanged by a Watteau shepherd . . .
It is curious that Swinburne, about
the least solid poet in English, should
have modelled himself on Baudelai
one of the solidest poets in French a ,
that Mallarme, vague in a precise
should have continued the Baudelain
tradition in French while Eliot, pre c j
in a solid way, should have continued
in English. But it is just as curious
read of the great name between $w E
burne and Eliot, Gerard Hopkins
The influence of Hopkins (on poe[ S
of the 1930’5) was largely in th e
realm of technique, and he owed
nothing to French literature.
Yet when you put the Fry-Maur
translations of Mallarme next to Hoi
kins’s poems you can’t help but t
struck by a similarity in the hand!
of metaphor; French and English, ot
concludes, had both reached a stas
where such developments were inevj
able.
Take the sestet of Hopkins’s sonne:
“Henry Purcell”:—
Let him oh! with his air of angels
then lift me, lay me! only I’ll
Have an eye to the sakes of him,
quaint moonmarks, to his pelted
plumage under
Wings: so some great stormfowl,
whenever he has walked his
while
The thunder-purple seabeach plumed
purple-of-thunder,
If a wuthering of his palmy snow
pinions scatter a colossal smile
Off him, but meaning motion fans
fresh our wits with wonder.
Compare with this the sestet |
Mallarme’s sonnet, “The Tomb
Charles Baudelaire,” in the Fit
Mauron translation:—
What votive foliage dried in evening'
less cities
Votive could bless as his shade could
sit
Vainly against Baudelaire’s marble
With the shivering veil that clothes
its absence
It, his shade, like a tutelary poison
Always to be breathed even if
die of it.
After a first impression of the»
larity of utter confusion, one ml
remark that although Mallarme ffi?
not approve of “wuthering,” the i®|
of wings scattering a colossal smile
as Mallarmean as anything in ft
lish. Next, we have Hopkins's of
note, admitting that, although the set
is not as clearly worked-out as he com
wish:—
The thought is that as the seabird
opening his wings with a whiff 0i
wind in your face means the whirr c!
the motion, but also unaware g |W ;

his own genius.
Then, as to the Mallarme sestet, we
have Fry s note:
The sense is, I think, as follows:
What votive wreath, with its dried-
up leaves, could equal, on this monu-
ment, the atmosphere of a great city
at night, with its play of light and
shade, and which Mallarme identifies
w ith Baudelaire’s spirit, morbid,
poisonous and none the less one of
our poetic resouces.
Hopkins is celebrating a musician.
Mallarme a poet: both see their subjects
as the sum of a complexity of meta-
phors. Purcell is a seafowl. then a
seafowl in motion, whose characteristics
(style) in flight are an unconscious
by-product of his purpose. Baudelaire
is an algebraic symbol, the man who
isn't there, emphasising by his absence
the poisonous beauty of a great city at
night as he created it in his poetry.
The circling of Hopkins’s thought
around the unconscious betrayal of
Purcell’s characteristics is here remark-
ably similar to Mallarme’s famous
preoccupation with the image of
“absence”; but even more striking is
the similarity of the handling in both
these sestets by men who almost cer-
tainly were unaware of each other.
Miss Starkie discusses also the debt
of English prose to France: Henry
James, James Joyce, Graham Greene
(to Mauriac), Somerset Maugham and
Katherine Mansfield (to Maupassant);
and she considers that English play-
wrights of between-wars would have
done better if they had had as many
companies of highly-trained actors in
“group-theatres” as were available to
the playwrights of Paris.

Reviewed Briefly
When the Ship Sank: James Mac-
Gregor (Heinemann). The story of
what happened when a luxury liner
sank after being torpedoed by a
German U-boat on the way from Eng-
land to America at the outbreak of
War 11. It’s a first novel, thrilling and
convincing, and gives a realistic picture
of what the sinkin” of a great ship can
mean and how different people react to
the disaster

The Faber Book of Stories: Edited
oy Kathleen Lines (Faber). A selection
intended “to help boys and girls to
wider horizons at an age when those
ooks written specifically for children
begin in their eyes to seem childish.”
There are 26 stories. 24 being by
writers from the British Isles, and the
exceptions Dal Stivens’s “The Cham-
pion Buckjumper” and Maupassant’s
“The Necklace.” Works by authors of
the late 19th century and first 30 years
of this predominate, but there are some
moderns. Subject-matter is catholic—
detection, satire, humor, drama, ghosts,
adventure. One finds the function of
such a book somewhat obscure:
children who are likely to like it might
be expected to have access elsewhere
to its sources, but it would certainly be
a safe present or prize for an adoles-
cent.

The Lighted Room: Jonatl
(Longmans). A disagreeable tirst-mne!
this: alleged by its blurb to
“brilliant and outrageous farce with
cunning insight into human wcakn -
The farce is at the expense of madness,
incipient and actual. The setting is a
large office, a few of whose more
obvious stock-types are fairly well
observed in a broad way: and. with
quite different treatment, the situation
which it develops could be interesting.
