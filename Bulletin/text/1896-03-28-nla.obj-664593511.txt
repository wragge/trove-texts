Literary Notes.
A NEW MAGAZINE.
Afc its second or third number The Yellow
Book came to the parting'of the ways between
modified Bohemian ism and Boheiniaiiism utter.
The publisher voted against realism, Baudelair-
ism, and “ degeneracy,” end his magazine became
'Comparatively Philistinish and respectable. Now,
the English apostles of the Very Unconventional
who may be typified with more or less accuracy
as Aubrey Beardsley di art, and Bernard Shaw in
literature—have evolved a quarterly magazine of
their own—The Savoy—which professes in a not
too modest foreword to ask and offer nothing but
“good work.”
For us all art is good which is good art. We hope to
appeal to the task a of the intelligent by not being
original for originality’s sake, or audacious for the sake
of advertisement, or timid for the convenience of the
elderly-minded.
And so on.
Unluckily the prefatory promise is hardly re-
deemed by performances. The first number of
the Savoy is smart and shallow, and, on the
whole, weak and disappointing. The posirg, and
the mannerisms, and the self-consciousness, irri-
tate more often than they amuse The illustra-
tions are mainly Beardsley’s—that is, they are
mainly quaint gambadoes or irrelevant uglinesses.
Beardsley, too, contributes the first chapters of
a “ romantic story ” —whereof a passage to taste :
Helen slipped away the dressing-gown and rose before
the mirror in a flutter of frilled things. She was ador-
ably (all and slender. Her neck and shoulders were
wonderfully drawn, and the littl- malicious breasts were
full of the irritation of loveliness that can never he
entirely comprehended, or ever enjoyed to the utmost.
Her arms and hands were loosely but delicately articu-
lated, and her legs were divinely long. From the hip to
the knee, 22 inches ; from the knee to the heel, 22 inches,
as befitted a goddess. Those who have spen Helen only
in the Vatican, in the Louvre, in the Utfizi, or in the
British Museum, can have no idea how very beautiful
and sweet she looked. Not at all like the lady in
Lemprifere.
A little of this goes far.
Perhaps the most readable of other items is
that in which Bernard Shaw advocates Church
as a stimulant. Havelock Ellis’s notice of Zola
is heavy, but with some suggestion. A good deal
of the remainder is tedious. And Arthur Symons,
who flatters and was flattered by Paul Verlaine,
translates one of the dead decadent’s poems
characteristically, in the style of a craftsman :
-■MANDOLINE.
The singers of serenades
Whisper their faded vows
Unto fair listening maids
Under the singing Loughs.
Tirris, Aminte, are there,
Clitandre is over-long,
And D unis for many a fair
Tyrant, makes many a song.
Th»ir short vests, silk' n and bright.
Their long, p il», siiki n trains,
Their ilfgance of (b light.
Twin, soft, blue, shadowy chains.
And the mandounes and they,
Faintlier breathing, swoon
Into the rose and grey
Ecstasy of the moon.
LOVE’S MATERIAL BASIS.
Writes Frederick Rockell in Feb. Fbee.Review
(a magazine which isn’t dull, or ponderous, or
antiquated, or half as well read ns it deserves to
be) :
That the altruistic spirit as expounded in Tolstoi’s
‘Life’ is entirely absent in sexual love is conclusively
shown by the fact that the perfect altruist would sacrifice
his lover for humanity, while ihe perfect lover for his
heart’s desire would sacrifice the world. Altruism and
sex love are entirely antagonistic concepts, and in any
single consciousness each must vary inversely with the
other.
We must not overlook the fact that even this broad
love for humanity is based on egotism, the following of
the line of least resistance; hut there is a sufficient dis-
tinction between the egotism that receives its fullest
satisfaction in making one particular woman happy, and
that egotism whose happiness consists of indiscriminately
bestowing good upon others, to warrant the use of the
terms altruism and egotism to differentiate these two
phases of egotistic Consciousness.
Perhaps a still commoner error is that which posits a
spiritual basis for sex attraction. Men and women, im-
bued with the Christian idea of the degradation of phy-
sical sex union, may deceive themselves into believing
that the basic element of their relations with the opposite
sex is spiritual and not physical ; that the subtle
streams of feeling which bind them together flow re-
sponsive to spiritual demands; that the harmonious
blending of being with being is due to the harmony of
their egos in their essential nature, apart from the sex of
their bodies ; hut the helief is based on purely empirical
assumption, which, when put to a practical test, melts
into its native moonshine. If sex love he spiritual, it
must be capable of existing apart from sex. For spirit,
or mentality, has no sex. But where is the lover whose
lot e would survive the metamorphosis of the ego of the
loved person into a body of the same sex as his own, or
into the body of an aged woman or decrepit man? Where
is the spiritual lover who would, with unaltered feelings,
regard the beloved being as the sexual possession of an-
other ?
Alfred Lee, in S.M. Herald, raises the interest-
ing question whether the word “Australia”
(which he thinks was first given to this country
by Le Maire) appeared, so spelt, in print before
162-'. In that year an account of Le Maire’s
voyage to the South Seas in 1615 was published at
Amsterdam, and on page 32 of this account “ Aus-
tralia” appears. The de Quir Memorial (1610)
refers to “ Australia,” but the point is: Who
fixed the current spelling ?
The Queenslander’s portrait of Henry Lawson
is so trimmed and barbered that the most fas-
hionable of minor songsters might own its soft
impeachments.” And Lawson is the author of
“ When Your Pants Begin to Go ” !
Some recent phrases :
The mind and the temper which enable woman to front
life as a rational combatant, instead of .wget iting as a
more or less destructive parasite.
S ie tasted in that moment something of the weakness
of womanhood—its pitiful groping artificiality, its keen
passionate realness.
Life may be said to be composed of things that come off
and tilings that don’t come off.
The long nights when we dropped down the Irrawaddy,
the whistle of the wind in the white sails, and the singing
of the boatmen, and the sick suck of the alligators among
the reeds.
A poet proceeds not by argument, but by vision. He
does not clothe a soul with flesh, but informs a bodv with
life.
The et rnal rehabilitative process, in which every
woman shows herself such an adept in relation to the
man she loves.
“Et s’ll revenait.”—Further versions to hand
from M.G. (metre well chosen ; phrases like “ puts
some questions more ” awkward, “ bare and
empty o’er” weak and pleonastic, &c ); \ M
ri.G., and HvO.I. (stiff, and. mistranslated).
A new vo uihe of Waterloo literature, E. L. S.
Horsburgli’s “Waterloo, a narrative and a
criticism,” is a student’s summation of documen-
tary evidence and comparison of contrary judg-
ments. The author does not warm to the
emotional aspects of his subject, but hib cool
e kit-ism is all the more luminous for the lack ;
•Hid there are dithyrambics enough already.
POETRY AND POLITICS.
One wonders whether William Watson is a poet
because he is a Liberal, or a Liberal because he is
a poet, or a little of each because he is a little of
both. Anyhow, the Liberal newspapers praise
him extravagantly; the Tory newspapers praise
him coolly; he sonnets the Liberal view of the
position in Armenia, while the Tory laureate
sonnets the Tory view ; and—where exactly is the
Muse while political devils are thus paid with such
a superabundance of piping-hot poetical pitch?
Superabundance—for the Armenian situation is
simply this : Britain has had definite diplomatic
warning that the continental Great Powers will
have none of her interference in Armenia,
massacres or no massacres. Salisbury has there-
fore simply had to ask himself whether he is
disposed to defy Europe for the sake of calming
the Nonconformist Conscience, and has answered
himself that he isn’t. Which affirmation of the
very sensible thesis that a great European war
would mean more bloodshed and misery than
many Armenian massacres has decided poet-
Watson, or politician-Watson, or poet-politician-
Watson that he does well to be very angry
indeed in seventeen neat little poems of 14 lines
each.
These sonnets are good enough (and Austin’s
counterblasts are bad enough) as sonnets go, but
they are worthlessed for want of factual and even
ethical basis. For, as the ingenious “0.5.”
(another Tory, by the way : the connection
between British politics and poetry must be close)
told W.W. :
It further seemed a work uncommon light
For one like you, a casual civilian,
To order half a hemisphere to fight,
And slaughter one another by the million,
While you yourself, a paper Galahad,
Spilt ink for blood upon a blotting-pad.
And then there is a suspicion of staginess in Mr.
Watson’s newest work—a hint of one eye in a fine
frenzy and another on the gallery—which detracts
still further from his “illusion.’-’ And he is quite
too poet-sure that “God”—who doesn’t crook a
little finger to blast “Abdul the Damned, on his
infernal throne ’—is angry at England’s inaction.
And—mother things.
POSTSCRIPT.
This enviable paper ! Oh, to think
That it will go, will really, really go
To her, my mistress. Had it soul to know,
What enviable paper ! Oh, to think
The sweet light of her eyes, her sweet clear eyes,
Shall shine on it; her sweet cool hands caress it,
And bear it to her sweet warm lips ; and press it
The sweet pale roses of her cheek. First, eyes,
Hands, lips, and cheek, and then, at night, all
nigh%
In the sweet darkness of her room (ah, so 1),
In the sweet stillness of her room (speak low !),
I guess where it will lie, at night, all night.
—Ernest Wentworth, in “ The Yellow Book."
Kenneth Graham’s “Golden Age ” has risen to
a deserved second edition. Its gleams of boyhood
are delightful enough to long preserve it from the
dust-heap of fugacious literature. Yet in one or
two later essays come signs .... well, happy is
the writer who is never in at his hobby’s death !
In the new Yellow Book, Richard le Gallienne,
who has done little notable lately, rebounds to a
“ prose fancy” on a level with his best. “As I
write, lie closes, “the moon looks down at me
like a Madonna from the great canvas of the sky.
She seems beautiful with the beauty of all the
eyes that have looked up at her, sad with the tears
of all those eyes; like a silver bowl brimming
with the tears of dead lovers she seems.”
Sydney School of Arts has a “ Suggestion
Book ” for the use of members. The other day
somebody proposed that the new magazine, Cos-
MOPOLis, should be obtained. The committee’s
report on this was “ eight numbers in the library.”
The next entry is by a subscriber who makes the
same suggestion, and in letters an inch long points
out that what is required is Cosmopolis, not Cos-
mopolitan. To a request for Watson’s “ Father
of the Forest,” the answer was “wait for a
cheaper edition.” No wonder that, with intelli-
gent readers, the popularity of this up-to-date
institution every year increases.
When Mrs. Kemble published her “Memoirs”
in the Atlantic Monthly, she referred to
“Omar” Fitzgerald as “an eccentric man of
genius, who took as much trouble to avoid fame
as others to obtain it.” Fitzgerald asked her to
withdraw the passage when the Memoirs should
appear in book form ; and meanwhile had the
separate magazine sheets bound for his private
use. These lie lent to a friend, who noticed that
me page was pasted over. It was the page with
the deinurred-to reference. Thus was the critic
justified of her author.
Anthony Hope’s “Comedies of Courtship”
reprints several magazine stories generally lacking
his early inspiration. “ The Curate of Boltons ”
most nearly suggests the light that failed—blown
out by flattery and a aucceWe-publishers.
Macmillan and Co. achieve “a big scoop ” by
;he addition of Kipling’s prose, Saintsbury’s new
translation of Balzac, and Wells’s “ Wonder-
ful Visit” to their cheap Col. Library—whose
owered merit-standard now goes up to the top of
;he class at a bound.
A new story by George Gissmg, “Sleeping
Fires” (Fisher Unwin), does not do that clever
observer credit. He analyses emotions admirably
from a fact-basis ; but his fancy cannot fly alone,
and when here, at page two-score or so, the plot is
laid bare, its development becomes tedious.
Canon Farrar’s “Gathering Clouds” —his se-
cond religio-historical romance in the style of
Kingsley s “ Hypatia ’’—runs to two volumes in
Longmans, Green’s Col. Library. Few large
underdone pies could weigh on the silent watches
of the night more than those two volumes.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RAPIDLY
CURED BY Hearne's Bronchitis cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the'chesc
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. I write you this acltnowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, exp ctorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I be ante,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney."
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices weie used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cuie, and after my boy' had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S. \V.”
We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successfid under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healitig power.”—Signed

Dr. Gibbons
Having comp'eted his New and Centrally-situated
Electrical & Consulting Rooms
Will be Pleased to Welcome bis Friends
and Patients at
137 EJizabeth-street, SYDNEY.
Dr. GIBBONS,
Who is trebly-qualified, and registered in London
and the Colonies as a Physician and a Surgeon,
received his education in the English and Scottish
universities, and completed his studies in the lead-
ing hospitals of Europe. He has made a life-long
study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS & SKIN DISEASES.
He has, by diligent research, investigated their
origin and course, and has discovered the quickest
and surest means of thoroughly curing them. He
has, by his unequalled success, during a period of
many years, obtained the highest position in his
profession. The various diseases embraced in his
speciality are those which have hitherto caused
more misery and suffering than any other kind of
trouble that affects the human frame.
Young Men and Those Who
Wish to Marry
who, as the result of early follies, or excesses of
more mature age, suffer from any of tfie follow-
ing symptoms, namely :—Frequent headaches,
giddiness, drowsiness in the daytime, irregularity
of tlie bowels, feeling of fullness after eating,
specks before the eyes, halos or circles round a
candle, cold hands and feet, pains in the back or
under the shoulder-blade, tenderness of the breast-
bone on pressure, yellow discharge from the
mouth on to the pillow during sleep, palpitation
of the heart, unpleasant dreams, clammy hands,
an aversion to society, a whitish or cloudy sedi-
ment in the urine after standing, fear of something
dreadful about to happen, impure blood, spots or
pimples on the back, chest, legs, or face, failing
memory, hacking cough, falling oPthe hair, kc.,
&c., should consult him, for he is now enabled
quickly and effectually, to remove the cause, and
so prevent life-long misery.
On Receipt op 6d. in Stamps He Will Send,
POST FREE,
A COMPLETE MEDICAL WORK,
fully describing how all private, nervous, and
skin diseases may be quickly and permanently
CURED, without loss of time and money. This
book will be of great assistance in making you
thoroughly acquainted with those diseases so
common in these colonies, and may enable you to
restore some poor sufferer to health and happiness
after having lost all hope.
ONE FOUND is Sufficient to Send
for Remedies necessary for the Cure of
DEBILIT Y,
And should be enclosed in the first letter.
Remember, “Procrastination is the Thief of
Time.” If, therefore, you experience any of the
symptoms enumerated above, DO NOT DELAY,
your case requires advice, and you can either call
and consult the Doctor personally, or, if you
reside at a distance, you can sit down quietly,
in the privacy of your own chamber, and write out
a full description of your ease, and send it by post.
DR. GIBBONS
will then write you a candid and straightforward
opinion. If, in writing, you do not feel compe-
tent to fully describe your case, send 6(1. in
stamps, and Dr. Gibbons will send you, post
free, the Latest Edition of his Celebrated Work,
in which you will find a list of carefully-prepared
questions that will assist you in giving a true
description of your ailment.
NONE NEED DESPAIR,
as in every case undertaken by Dr. GIBBONS
A Permanent Cure
is absolutely assured.
Dr. GIBBONS uses none but the very purest
remedies, and never, under any circumstances,
prescribes Mercury in any form.
PATIENTS are reminded that their LETTERS
ARE DESTROYED BY FIRE
immediately they have been read and answered,
and that tiieir cases and names will remain a
secret between the Doctor and themselves.

PARTED.
Maoriland.
It was not in the morning
Or evening that we met,
No land the world adorning
Was round about us set —
But we remember yet.
Wild roses were the border
That girdled all the land,
Dear Love in sweet disorder
Had dropped them from his hand —
Like Time’s deceiving sand.
Were dryads tryst a-keeping?
Were fauns a-foot with Pan ?
Were pain and sorrow sleeping
As when the world began ?
As Love himself began.
The swans have flown asunder
On Love’s secluded lake,
His star is muffled under
Clouds that will not break—
Oh ! sweet, for old love’s sake!
H. C.
SONG OF THE OLD SUN-DIAL.
I sing no nitric lays of truth,
But film the cancer-eaten past
With eerie fay-lore, verve of youth,
Romance and burgeonry of caste :
I strive that Glory’s charnel-room
No gentle nostril overpowers ;
Tho’ grief a million days may gloom,
“ I only count the sunny hours.”
The sky may warn, in cirrus scroll,
Of cataclysmic change ahead ;
Insistent stratus layer with dole
Horizons spacious Hope had spread ;
Weird wrongs may mass their cumuli,
Or, lurid, belch from nimbus towers :
These weary Joy. I pass them by,
And “only count the sunny hours.”
The dark is for “ the common herd ”
By whom God’s dirty work is done ;
By whom life’s sweetmeats are prepared
For those who can enjoy the sun.
Y ou’d have me pen their shoddy strife,
And deem their fungus virtues flowers ?
Deny that glad repose is life,
And cease to “count the sunny hours ” ?
Tho’ woman soiled blaspheme the night,
And veins of men are leeched for gold,
Tho’ stark religions nations blight
And vulture Hunger waxes bold ;
There are a few who know not this,
A lily few, in rosy bowers,
To spare their dainty hearts it is,
“ I only count the sunny hours.”

THE DREAM OF THE FREE.
I had a happy dream last night:
Methought I was a slave ;
Weak wills ruled mine ; their touch was light;
Soft eyes commandments gave.
To wife and child, no more apart,
Love’s chains were binding me.
I woke, and sadness filled my heart
I found that I was free.
Oh ! did I deem my lot was hard,
To toil and never cease ?
Were wife and child a poor reward?
Death brought me soon release ;
But in that world where loss and pain
Shall ne’er remembered be,
They’ll let me wear those chains again,
And never more be free.
Maoriland.
C. CLYDE.
INNOCENCE.
She smiled ; dim love-lights, long concealed,
Life beckoned, slow were born :
And sequent passion swiftly sealed
Her present peace forsworn.
She smiled again, and stooped to drink
Where mortals may not quaff ;
Unheeding on the vibrant brink
A demon’s dreadful laugh.
In wide wastes of white shifting sand,
Half conquered, all beguiled,
A grey ghost led her by the hand ;
And yet again she smiled.

HESKETH.
Disclosed at the trial of the Reform Com-
mittee at Pretoria that Col. Rhodes communicated
with Dr. Jameson by means of a cyclist named
Celliess, the despatch being carried in the saddle.
This is the lir.it time the cycle has been used in
actual warfare. Celliers was taken prisoner when
returning 'with the doctors letter to the Colonel,
and the despatch fell into the hands of the Boers.
“ What strikes a stranger in Brisbane,”
writes a much-travelled Bulletin correspondent,
“ is the ignorance and uncommunicativeness of the
local police. If you ask one to direct you any-
where the almost invariable reply is : ‘ Well, sor,
raley I don’t know where it is. I’m a stranger
here meself.’ They must move them around a
good'deal up there, so that they won’t form local
ties. Consequently, if a Brisbane man wants to
know the time, he has to look at his own watch.

SATURDAY, MARCH 28, 1896.
Syndicates and Boodle.
The Sydney Daily Telegraph, which holds
a perpetual brief on behalf of ‘ ‘ private en-
terprise,” raised its voice the other day, for
the five hundredth time or more, in the cause
of the boodler and the syndicate, and in op-
position to the principles of State Socialism.
The following is Fat Man’s case, as set forth
in the D.T. :
Of what use is it (Freetrade) if, the moment anybody
proposes to take advantage of it, Parliament raises an ob-
jection, as it has recently been in the habit of doing when-
ever private enterprise has asked for permission to go to
work at its own risk and utilise the opportunities for pro-
fitable employment which the country offers? At the
present time there are vast amounts of stagnant capital
that would be invested in providing conveniences for the
people and facilitating public industry. The State could
get a number of needful works of this kind done . . .
without increasing the liabilities of the taxpayer by a
single penny, or taking any responsibility for their finan-
cial success. There is the connection of the two halves
of the metropolis by bridge or tunnel. . . . Then
there is the supplying of Sydney with electricity for
power and lighting purposes. ... If any one offers
to bring the city up to date in this way, it is treated as a
plot to loot the public, and indignantly stamped upon . .
as if there could be any possibility of loot in connection
with such matters unless Parliament deliberately author-
ised it. . . . The money which would come here for
legitimate investment therefore goes into wild-cat mines
in Western Australia. . . . Experience proves that,
except under certain special circumstances what is done
by private enterprise ... is generally done more
effectively and at less cost to the public than when under-
taken by the State. The State is such a bad business
manager . . . that in the world’s competitive arena
. . . it has no chance against private enterprise,
&c., &c.
* * * »
This outbreak raises the whole question of
private versus State enterprise, and the vast-
ness of its mendacity, as well as a good many
other things, makes it worthy of a passing
notice. In the first place, it assumes that
the people of N.S. Wales are poor and per-
manently short of employment because the
State won’t hand over the electric-lighting of
Sydney and the North Shore railway-bridge
to “private enterprise,” which is a large
assumption and an eminently foolish one to
boot. These two works would find employ-
ment for perhaps 2000—or more probably
1000—out of the 30,000 or 40,000 of
the unemployed, and they would employ
these few workers for a year or two at most.
The great balance of the workless multi-
tude would be left just where they were ; the
benefit would be almost imperceptible and
what there was of it would be.- only tem-
porary. The capital—it is distinctly foreign
capital that is alluded to—that found invest-
ment in the North Shore bridge and the
electric-lighting service would be counter-
balanced to some extent by a large amount
of local capital wrecked in the superseded
gas and ferry services. Meanwhile, the
inference that relief can only be obtained in
this fashion is wholly ridiculous. The
refusal of the State to hand over these two
splendid monopolies to private enterprise for
ever, merely for the sako of affording an
imperceptible amount of temporary relief, is
no reason whatever why the capital which is
alleged to be yearning to employ itself and
the people should not find employment
forthwith. There are innumerable avenues
open which the State has left exclusively to
private enterprise, and where no Parlia-
mentary sanction is required. New South
Wales wants weaving, spinning, worsted,
tweed, and miscellaneous clothing factories,
iron, brass, and steel works, foundries,
shipbuilding-yards, carpet-factories, tea-
plantations, beet-farms and sugar-mills and
refineries to treat the product thereof,
tobacco - plantations, cement - works, wire-
works, glassworks, sawmills, and a thousand
other industries, to supply locally the wants
which are now supplied by the importer.
There are £15,000,000 or £20,000,000 worth
of goods per annum wanted to be made in
New South Wales, to fill the urgent require-
ments of the inhabitants of the jirovince,
and, at the same time, to furnish work for
its people and profits for its capitalists.
And, with all this immense field of enter-
prise open, the spectacle of the aforesaid
capitalists—who want to employ their money
so badly —weeping on the Government door-
step because the State won’t assist and coddle
them by handing over rich monopolies per Act
of Parliament is abject and pitiable. The
enterprise which won’t move unless the
State endows it with a valuable concession,
and supplies it with half-a-million compul-
sory customers is not private enterprise, or
anything distantly resembling it.
* * * *
Private enterprise, in great public works
like the North Shore bridge and the Sydney
electric-lighting scheme and many other in-
dustrial and financial undertakings, is dis-
tinctly dearer, less efficient, more clumsy,
more dishonest, and more unreliable than
the enterprise of the State, the Telegraph’s
dictum to the contrary notwithstanding. In
almost every line of business where the State
and the private capitalist have competed, the
State has proved itself the more efficient of
the two. The State has conducted banking
operations in Australia for many years, and
every State savings bank has kept solvent
through good times and bad. Private enter-
prise has strewn this new country already
with wrecks innumerable. The Bank of
Australia, Bank of Auckland, Bank of
Queensland, Bank of Port Phillip, Town
and Country Bank, the Bank of S.A., the
two Mercantiles, the Federal, the awful City
of Melbourne, the Commercial of S.A., the
twelve (or thereabouts) land banks of
Matthew Davies, the three or four cracked
Munro institutions, the Australian Banking
Co., the two or three dozen other miscel-
laneous banks which broke in different parts
of Australia since 1890, the innumerable
collapsed building societies, the 8.N.Z.,
which was only saved by being taken,
by the State, out of the hands of private
owners—these are a few out of the
great multitude of examples of the stupidity,
expensiveness, dishonesty and unreliabity of
private enterprise. So are the Queensland
National, kept alive by State support after
private management had run it on the rocks;
the Colonial of Maoriland, rescued in the
hour of danger by the new State-managed
institution ; and the New South Wales banks
which didn’t burst because they were saved
by the State guarantee of their note issues.
The Bank of England, commonly regarded
as the brightest example of everything that
a bank should be, only exists to-day because
the State came to its assistance over and
over again ; otherwise it would have gone
the way of private enterprise in general. On
the other side of the record the Maoriland
State Life Department has shown that the
State can conduct insurance business very
much more cheaply than any privately-
managed institution of the same size under
the same conditions, and the State office is
the only one belonging to this country on
whose honesty and solvency there rests no
shadow of suspicion whatsoever. On a rough
estimate two-thirds of the life assurance
offices which existed in Britain and
America have died - pf dishonesty or mis-
management, or both, but this one State
office has, so far, kept its record untarnished.
The Maoriland Public Trust Office also
stands immeasurably above the private
trustee companies (at least half of which are
admittedly in great difficulties) for honesty
and efficiency. As for the private trustee,
who is (or should be) mostly in gaol for being
a Gent One, he is too great a failure to be
worth mentioning.
* * * *
State railway management has, so far,
shown distinctly better results than the
“ private enterprise ” article. The difference
between the two is that the State, as a rule,
honestly meets its obligations ; the private co.
files its schedule when things go badly, and
leaves its creditors in the lurch. If the Vic-
torian system had been in the hands of private
companies, the Outer Circle line, the Lance-
field line, most of the little Gippsland
branches, and a whole lot of the miscellaneous
cockspurs would have gone broke separately
on the American plan, written down their
capital, and compounded with their deben-
ture-holders. Then they might have shown
3 per cent, profit on what capital was left.
The more profitable lines, which yield 5 or 0
per cent., would have meanwhile gone on as
usual, and the whole system might have
shown a paper dividend of 4 per cent, all
round, instead of 24as at present. The
State could produce similar results by the
same process ; if it liked to repudiate
£20,000,000 of the public debt, or to allege
by a book-keeping entry that its railway sys-
tem was liable for only £20,000,000 capital
instead of £37,000,000, it would arrive at
exactly the same results as the private syndi-
cate and by exactly the same method. But
there would be no real saving ; the profits
would not be one penny greater ; it would be
a mere juggle with pen and ink and nothing
more. The Maoriland Midland Co. lias
cheerfully abandoned its unfinished line \
sold its available land-grants and “ blewed
the proceeds, and left its luckless debenture-
holders to scramble for their principal and
interest. The State, even if its management
had been equally awful —-and the most
iniquitous Government ever known in these
provinces never made such an unspeakable
muddle of any enterprise would have
debited the line with its entire cost and, pro-
bably, when it was finished and in working
order, have shown a dividend of 2s. 6d. per
cent, per annum on the original outlay. The
private co. avoids this by bidding the original
outlay, as represented by the people who lent
the money, to go to perdition, and this rough-
and-ready process of writing off capital
enables private capital to show much better
results on paper if it feels so inclined. But
the difference doesn’t represent any saving
whatever. If the private railways of Europe
and America were debited, as the Australian
State lines are, with all the money spent
upon them, the annual interest returns
would be something appalling in their ex-
treme smallness. The worst kind of State
management has built the Australian rail-
ways more cheaply than the private lines of
Canada, the United States, and every Euro-
pean country save Scandinavia and Denmark
—which is at least something for the despised
system to boast of.
*■ * * *
In Great Britain public ownership is
rapidly superseding privates enterprise in the
matter of gas supply. Over one-third of the
British gas supply is now in the hands of
the people, with the result that the private
companies charge on an average 3s. 10gd.
per 1000 cubic feet, while the corporations
furnish an equally good illuminant for
3s. 4|d. The successful State tobacco mono-
polies of many European countries, and the
State postal and telegraph systems are
further evidences of the possibilities of
national control. The State, it is true, has
temporary booms and deliriums, but private
enterprise gets them in a much worse form.
The Victorian railway system, which is at
present under a very bad cloud, is often held
up as an awful example of the evils of
State management because it represents
£37,000,000 sunk—much of it in a sudden
boom madness—in an enterprise which only
yields a little over 2f per cent. Private en-
terprise, on the other side, is represented
by the £40,000,000 of nominal capital sunk
in Westralian gold-mines, which yield so far,
all round, about one shilling per cent. ; so
that, judged by the actual returns, private
management is about fifty-five times the more
incompetent and expensive of the two. Pri-
vate enterprise—its cheapness, intelligence,
and other advantages—is further represented
by all the millions buried in the mud at
Panama : about as many as are represented
by the whole railway system of South Aus-
tralia or Maoriland. It is represented, on a
smaller scale in Australia, by the insolvent
Mildura irrigation settlement, the defunct
A.S.N. Co., the Midland railway already
mentioned, the broken banks with their
awful “revelations,” by between ten and
twenty gone-broke fire-insurance companies,
by Fink’s |d. in the £, and the like. The
difference between State control and private
enterprise, as shown in this country, may be
summed up in a few sentences. The State
never writes off its capital ; the money it has
spent in needless railways, ill-planned harbor,
irrigation and other schemes, costly and dis-
honest land-resumptions and the like, always
stands up in judgment against it in the
figures of the public debt. Private enter-
prise buries the story of its failures in the
Insolvency Court to the extent of about
£4,000,000 or £5,000,000 per annum, and
says no more about it. £f the State simply
put the Illawari'a railway, or the famous
Outer Circle line, aqt its various irrigation
failures, or its loans to municipalities that
can t pay up, into a schedule, and paid 6d. or
so in the £ to the British bond-holders whose
money was invested in these particular enter-
prises, and got its certificate in the usual
course, it could probably show that it was
making 10 per cent, on its remaining under-
takings and thereby demonstrate the bless-
ings of State management to all comers. Or
if it could reconstruct its creditors, or drop
its lost capital out of sight, ~ and leave its
shareholders—the investors in the Public
Debt—in the lurch, or settle its ' good
assets on its wife and then assign its
estate, or compound privately for one
Fink m the £, it would arrive at the
same result. And if, on the other hand,
the aggregate private enterprise of the coun-
try was debited with all the capital written
off, and the hundreds of millions wiped out
m the insolvency court, and with the liquida-
tions, and the millions of unaccounted-for bad
debts, and the secret compositions, it would
probably be shown that it was earning some-
thing like os. per cent, per annum all round
or possibly less, and the general verdict of
the unthinking multitude would be that
private enterprise was only another name
for idiocy.
* * * *
To return to the original text, the Daily
Telegraph’s plea for the handing over to
the private boodler of the North Shore rail-
way and the Sydney electric-lighting mono-
poly is a fine example of confused argument
and wilful suppression of fact. These ruinous
proceedings are advocated, first, on the plea
that they will absorb the stagnant capital in
the country. Secondly, they are supported on
the plea that they will bring into the country
“ for legitimate investment ” some of the
money now flowing to Coolgardie, therefore
it seems they are really to be executed with
British money, and the stagnant local capital
is to be left in its present unprofitable con-
dition, so this end of the plea is a self-
evident fraud. They are to absorb the
surplus labor of the country, W'hereas these
two small temporary jobs would hardly make
any visible impression on the great mass of
the unemployed. If they are carried out by
the State they will probably be done with
borrowed money for which the community
will pay about 3h per cent. ; if they are done
by private enterprise they will be built with
money that will want 5 or 6 or 8 per cent.,
or as much more per cent, as it can get,
and in each case the per centage must
be paid by the community in some shape or
another. Yet, by putting the matter in
private hands and doubling, or nearly
doubling, or more than doubling the amount
to be extracted from the taxpayer, the work
is to be done according to this reasoning,
without increasing that person’s liabilities
“ by a single penny.” And, curiously enough,
the desire of the Fat Man paper seems to be
solely directed towards the handing over to
private enterprise of these two undertakings,
each a magnificent monopoly with an assured
profit attached, and no others. There is no
suggestion that stagnant private capital
should occupy itself by building a railway
system west of the Darling, -where no railways
haveyetbeenprovided, oroutbeyond Hayand
Cobar, or in the gruesome desolations around
Hungerford. These profitless, but necessary,
jobs are cheerfully left to the State and the
taxpayer. The building of railways in the
wilderness “Out Back,” the locking of
western rivers, the construction of irrigation-
works in the thirsty backblocks, and all such
undertakings, are distinctly matters for the
State only. But similar works in the
densely-peopled city, where dividends are
certain, should, in the Telegraph’s opinion,
be reserved strictly for private enterprise,
and any interference with it is a sinful
example of grandmotherly legislation. And
private enterprise, according to the Tele-
graph’s definition, is a thing that howls
piteously to be subsidised by valuable State
concessions, and then works them with bor-
rowed English money, and which won’t
move unless it is thus subsidised, and won't
risk its own money by any chance, but
always shrieks for J. Bull to come to its
assistance. An affair like that is hardly
worth calling “ enterprise.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Freetrade Prices.
A few days ago a (presumably genuine) lady
correspondent broke out in the columns of the
S.M. Herald to the effect that Freetrade was,
after all, a snare and a disappointment. The
price of necessaries for a workman’s family, she
alleged, hadn’t diminished in the least; the
alleged benefits hadn’t come along; and the
load that was to be lifted off the backs of the
toiling masses hadn’t lifted worth a straw.
Other correspondents promptly followed in the
same strain, and the trouble grew so bad that
at last the serious old paper was moved to
demonstrate (in its issue of March 18) that
there really was a reduction in prices, and that
the weary toilers and moilers were experiencing
the blessings of Freetrade though they might
not be aware of the fact. It published a long
list of prices as they were before and after the
beginning of the imported shoddy regime, and
the list has brought consolation up on the
Rocks, and carried joy to Waterloo and Botany
and Surry Hills. Tinned turkey, tinned tongue,
Strasburg meat and anchovy paste have
dropped from Is. to lid., and anyone
who knows the vast quantities of these
things consumed by the working classes
will appreciate this boon at its full
value. American tinned fruits (largely con-
sumed by the local pick-and-shovel man) have
fallen from 21s. to 19s. per doz. Imported
English biscuits by the best makers have also
declined ; citron-peel is down ; likewise pre-
served cherries, 22 kinds of farinaceous foods,
Mellin’s food, Allen and Hanbury’s food,
and Neaves’ food. (The wharf-laborer is
much addicted to Neaves’ food, and the rush
for Mellin’s food among coal-lumpers is some-
thing unprecedented.) The costly varieties of
boots, ranging from 325. 6d. a pair (the kind
naturally used by people who repair the streets)
to 12s. 9d., have all been reduced, though the
coarse, unpoetic blucher apparently remains
where it was—at least, no figures are given to
show the contrary. Four-button gloves are
much cheaper; so are silk velvets, surah silk,
best Brussels carpet (the kind that the artisan
and laborer and corporation mud-pusher all use
in their drawing-rooms), Kensington art carpet
squares (grea.tly rushed after by itinerant pea-
nut vendors and the men who heave the ropes
01 i • kj l6 ferry-boats), and tapestry carpets
(chiefly patronised by small selectors). Also,
dagdag (whatever that may be) is now
only 295., whereas it was formerly 355., and
gentlemen s white shirts have been reduced
considerably. The present writer also adds,
from personal experience, that tapestry cut-


tains are selling at lower prices, and that
marb.e clocks are a good deal cheaper. All
these things go to prove that the frequent
boast of the CoD-fearing Ministry that it has
taken a load amounting to .£500,000 (sometimes
the figure is stated at £800,000) a year off the
shoulders of the working classes rests on a good,
solid foundation. Bread, it is true, went up
about December last and hasn’t gone down
since ; meat remains the same ; and Premier
Reid declared recently at Hillgrove that grain
and flour were dearer than they had been for
many years. But the reduction in best Brussels
carpet, art squares, four-button gloves, silk
velvet, surah silk, tapestry, boots at 325. 6d. a
pair, tinned turkey, tinned fruits, bottled
cherries, citron peel, shrimp paste, and Skin-
ner’s real turtle-soup (now only 2s. lid. per
tin as against 3s. under a semi-Protectionist
r4gime) has brought gladness to the homes of
the very poorest and filled the pick-and-shovel
person with a joy that is too great for words.
♦
The Humorous Aspect of a Bank.
The City of Melbourne Bank inquiry is full of
wild humor to those people who did not risk
their money in that famous wild-cat institution,
and who can therefore afford to take an
unbiassed view of the concern. A good deal of
the humor has been supplied by Thomas
Loader, chairman of directors. Loader was
apparently the principal boss of the institution.
He was paid by the shareholders to guard their
interests, to know what the bank was doing,
and to tell the truth to the shareholders about
the dreadful affair, and if he didn’t do these
things his fees were money obtained practically
under false pretences. How he attended to his
duties is best shown by his own evidence. Mr.
Loader “didn’t think he ever saw” a book
which showed that £138,000 had gone in bad
debts ; he didn’t know whether the bank ob-
jected to an enormously large overdrafter giving
id. in the £ in full of all claims, or what the
securities were for a £190,000 loan ; he had
never heard of a certain £57,000 overdraft,
and he really couldn’t say how the
bank came to guarantee £l2OO a year
to one of its debtors who owed it
£200,000 on rather shaky security. He couldn’t
give any information about a security said to be
worth £83,000, and really worth, perhaps, a
tenth of that sum. In regard to a cable mes-
sage to the London directors stating that the
largest advance was £170,000, while there were
debtors who owed the bank nearly twice that
amount, this same remarkable chairman “really
knew nothing of it.” He couldn’t tell how one
large overdraft was never charged interest, and
when he heard that the bank bought its own
shares, and registered clerks and others as the
nominal holders of them, he merely thought
that it was “ very likely.” Mr. Loader
vaguely understood that the deceased manager
had debited the loss on some of his (the mana-
ger’s) private share transactions to a customer,
who repudiated the debt with scorn; but
nothing was done in the matter. He “sup-
posed ” that something had been done about
a bogus draft drawn by the same manager for
£2300, but was evidently hazy on the point;
and he didn’t even know, after 25 years of bank-
directing, how an appropriation for losses was
made. He also couldn’t explain how an alleged
“inner reserve” of over £lOO,OOO was re-
presented as being in existence after it
had all been used up, and he didn’t know
anything about the balance-sheet of an awful
firm which owed the bank £300,000 or more
These are a few taken at random out of many
dozen things that Loader “ didn’t know ” or
“couldn’t remember” or “had never heard
of.” The rest of the directors were all more or
less hazy—one of them really didn’t know that
he owed the bank a very large overdraft until
his attention was drawn to it ; they mostly
knew hardly anything that they should have
known, and they mostly owed the bank an im-
mense lot of money on dreadfully bad security ;
but Loader’s haziness about everything was
more hazy than the haziness of all the rest of
the board put together. Taking him on his
own valuation, Loader’s defence was that he
was ignorant, stupid, reckless and incompetent;
that he didn’t do the work he was paid to do,
and let the bank muddle itself away through
his callous indifference to the interests of the
people who trusted him; and that after 25
years’ banking experience he was such an un-
speakable “ duffer ” that he didn’t know some of
the simplest details of the business. And as the
law stands, Loader can’t be made responsible
for his ghastly neglect. If he had driven a
locomotive which blew up and killed a dozen
passengers, and he defended himself by saying
that, though he called himself an engineer, he
really knew nothing about locomotives, and had
merely gone fooling down an incline at random,
the law would probably give him seven years
for manslaughter. If he was a captain and
wrecked his ship from sheer ignorance and
neglect, the law would take his certificate from
him. If he were anything but a bank-director,
he would be held personally responsible for the
consequences of his reckless muddlement—but
a bank-director is practically responsible for
nothing at all. And he can’t be made respon-
sible, for, as old James Service pathetically
remarked, if directors (like Loader) were held
personally liable for their doings, it would be
impossible to get decent men (like Loader) to
accept the position. And if men like Loader
wouldn’t accept the position, the consequences
would obviously be something awful.
A Presbyterian on Drink.
The N.S.W. Presbyterian Assembly recently
got on the subject of drink, and made a number
of wholly unexpected remarks thereon. In the
matter of whisky the Presbyterian Assembly—
whose name mostly begins with Mac —is pro-
bably better qualified to speak with authority
than any other religious body in Christendom.
It may not know more about beer than does
anybody else, and its ideas about cocktails and
gin-sling and brandy-smash and dog’s-no3e may
be limited, but on whisky its information is
solid and reliable, and extends down to the
deepest bowels of the subject. And the
Presbyterian Assembly, in the vastness of its
knowledge about whisky, was mostly unfavor-
able to a certain enthusiastic brother who
wanted to rush things in the Cold Tea interest.
Said one reverend gentleman :
It was not whisky that was ruining the people, but
Kow s embrocation and painkiller, sold diluted with water,
shearers and bush workers, overcome with the loneliness
and miseries of their existence, came into town when the
feeling of depression became so strong that they could
not bear it, and were driven to drown their miseries by
knocking down their cheques. It was not the drink that
u a a , oln S them the harm, but the hocussed liquor. He
had known men knocked down by a couple of glasses of
liquor, and who knew nothing after. They said that
when they had drunk those two glasses they felt their feet
go, and their limbs became helpless. Two glasses of
honest liquor would not do this for any man. . . But
they must do something as well to counteract the loneli-
ness which caused the spree. Young men had nowhere
to go to, and no means of amusement, and they went to
the hotels to seek it. . . Drunkenness was as often
caused by poverty as poverty by drunkenness. It was
not poverty that killed a man, but hopeless poverty. The
feeling that he was down and couldn’t get up brought a
man to the condition in which he would drink anything
just to drown his misery. . . Teetotallers could do a
great deal more for their cause if they were not so unrea-
sonable. He had often tried to go with teetotallers,
though he had never been one ; but when he went to
them he found them so terribly crabbed, cranky, and un-
sociable, that he had to seek other company. If you went
into a teetotaller’s house, you could not get up without
antimacassars sticking in your coat-tails. Their houses
seemed made to look at, not to live in. You couldn’t
smoke, you couldn’t wink, you couldn’t do anything.
Ordinary people found it hard enough to keep ten Com-
mandments, but instead of ten the teetotallers had ten
thousand.
Several other reverends tackled the subject in
the same strain. There was apparently nobody
in the Assembly who approved of heavy drink-
ing) but the more jovial of the rev. Macs ob-
jected strongly to the grimness and gloom of
the Cold Tea movement, and earnestly urged
the Cold Tea faction to try and be more cheer-
ful. Wherein they undoubtedly struck the
right nail on the head. The cadaverous aspect
of the teetotal party, and its desire to sit
straight up on a hard chair and to be in bed by
ten, are things that do a great deal to keep the
whisky interest going. When the bushman
comes into a strange town after a long spell of
solitude among the gum-trees and the plains,
his first craving is to find a live human being,
or a number of them, to foregather with. In
many cases he doesn’t want drink so much as
he wants to become rapidly acquainted with a
lot of people and get rid of his loneliness as
much as possible. He can’t do it in a bun-shop,
for even a bushman can’t eat buns all day, and
the terrified female behind the counter wouldn’t
meet him in a hilarious spirit, anyhow. He
can’t go straight to the house of the principal
teetotaller and become a temporary brother
to him, and sing rowdy songs in his
drawing-room, and he can’t go and riot
in the boot-shop. What he wants is as much
noise and gaiety and good, or bad, fellowship
as he can crowd into the time, as an antidote to
the silence and grey desolation that have eaten
into his soul; he wants noise of any kind—
music, profanity, the smash of dishes, free
fights, anything at all that is unlike the old
solitude. And the pub. is the only place where
a complete stranger can go and begin to riot
with all and sundry without previous acquain-
tance. If the leading teetotallers are willing
to get together and make friends and yell with
any complete stranger from the bush at a
moment’s notice, and sing comic songs with
him, and introduce him to the gold-washed
girl in the tart and ginger-ale shop, then they
also may supply a long-felt want jin his soul.
But they are sad and silent like the gum-tree
and the native bear and the staring bullock,
and Clancy of the Overflow finds no joy or
variety in them.
The Bench v. the Law.
Sydney stipendiary magistrate Giles is
a decent magistrate—as Sydney stipendiary
magistrates go. (The Bulletin leaves it to its
Sydney readers toappraise the value of this com-
pliment). No doubt the jabbering Mr. Giles’s
decision to refuse costs and make fines nominal,
in diseased-cattle-selling cases, is reached hon-
estly. Yet this decision, and the action based
on it, are matters of very serious offence to the
public. The law of N.S. Wales declares that
anyone who sells diseased cattle is guilty of a
crime against the public health, and may be
heavily fined therefor. The law is sensible and
right. In many cases it is impossible to tell"
that a beast is diseased before it is killed.
Whoever buys a diseased beast buys it as sound,
and pays the price for it as sound. Conse-
quently it is unjust that, when the carcase is
condemned as unfit for food, he should lose his
money. Any risk which he can guard against
betakes willingly. Here is a risk which he
cannot guard against, and should not be com-
pelled to take. No man has a right to pass off
on another damaged goods as sound, says the
law. Therefore, let the seller suffer, said
Parliament. “We compel the stock-buyer to
vend nothing but good meat to his customers ;
we will similarly compel the stock-seller to vend
nothing but good meat to his customer, the
stock-buyer.” And so, a few months ago,
when certain diseased cattle were sold for
the Sydney market, the buyers refused to
purchase them as sound, and prosecuted the
salesmen for breach of the law. The
salesmen were fined, in moderation. Then
a great outcry arose. The salesmen button-
holed their club-friends, and they and their
club - friends buttonholed members of the
Government and their club-friends, and—so it
was allegecl—a circular was issued from the
Department of Justice, desiring magistrates to
deal gently with the erring salesmen. The
magistrates were said to declare that they
would not be dictated to, and the fining pro-
ceeded —but, significantly, in much more mode-
ration. Now comes Daniel Giles to judgment,
and declares that he will not give effect
to the spirit of the law at all, and
doubtfully to its letter; and embodies his
declaration in a fine of Is., without costs. Mr.
Giles arrogates too much to himself. He is
the interpreter of the law, not its judge. His
private opinion seems to be that the seller of a
diseased beast, a worthless article, should be
allowed to cheat the buyer out of its price ;
but the bench is no place for the utterance of
Mr. Giles’s private opinions, when they are
held against equity and against law. Relying,
it may be, on the wink of his official superiors,
he goes much too far. The Bulletin trusts
that, if possible, an appeal to the Supreme
Court will at once follow. Should that prove
fruitless, Parliament may be safely trusted to
deal with Mr. Giles.
Sydney Daily Telegraph sets forth some of
the strange anomalies of the N.S.W. Land and
Income Tax :
If you have £3OO worth of land, and make £3OO a year
oy growing potatoes, your annual tax is 00 pennies, or ss.
rJut if you write a book or patent an invention, or keep
a store, or drive a railway-engine, and make £3OO, and
land at all, your annual tax is £2 10s.
This may be an anomaly, but it’s the law.
Aflorist who earns £2O a week from the cultivation of
£241 of land pays no income-tax. His total tax is a penny
a year. 1 J
If, however, he pays a manager a salary of £3OO a year,
the manager is taxed to the extent of £2 10s.
As a contrast to the florist, the professional or business
*?who earns £2O a week, and hasn’t any land, will pay
£2O a year in taxes.
Income obtained directly from the land is exempt from
income taxation, because the land pays land-tax.
If, therefore, you derive rents from houses on land of
an unimproved value of less than £240, you include the
amount in your income-return.
But if your rents are from houses erected on land whose
unimproved value is over £240 you do not pay income-
What you pay is land-tax.
If you receive a rent of £4O on a house built on land of
an unimproved value of £240 you pay 20s. tax.
While if you receive £4O or any other amount of rent
from a house built on land of the unimproved value of
£260 you pay only Is. Bd. tax.
In the first instance the amount of the tax depends on
the amount of the rent.
In the second it depends on the value of the land.
Consequently, if a man lias a salary of ,£2OO a
year, and also a piece of land worth (unim-
proved) ,£240, and a house on it which yields
£BO rent, he comes under the income-tax and
pays £2 a year taxes. But if a man has a
salary of £2OO a year, and also a piece
of land worth (unimproved) £720, on
which is erected a terrace of houses
bringing in £4OO a year, he only comes
under the land-tax, and pays just ,£2 a
year on more than twice the income and five or
six times the property ! This cheerful state of
things is probably called discouraging the big
monopolist, and shifting the burden of taxation
on to the shoulders of the rich, and other things
of the same kind. In other words, if the Act
has been correctly interpreted, the big landlord
of the Sydney Burdekin description (whose
land is worth over £240) pays neither land nor
income-tax on his house rents, while the small
one whose land is worth less than £240 pays
6d. in the £ on his house-rents. Either the
Telegraph or the Act has been drinking.
There is one (and only one) hopelessly illogical
item in the Queensland Labor programme—
that clause which demands the establishment of
a “ State department of Labor to which men
can apply for work at a minimum wage as a
right.” No one province and no one country
or even continent can run such a department,
unless it can and does effectually shut out all
immigrants except people of solid wealth.
If Queensland established a department
which was bound to find work at a decent
wage for all comers, there are probably
50,000 Cornstalks, 40,000 Victorians, and
40,000 people from Maoriland, Fiji, South
Australia, Tasmania, and VYestralia, to say
nothing of the countless thousands of British,
Germans, and others, who would want to
“ trek ” for the land of promise at once, and
Queensland can’t supply work and a minimum
wage to all creation. A country where employ-
ment and decent pay were a dead certainty
would attract a stream of workless inhabitants
from all the four ends of the earth. And, by
the way, why is the department to find work
for all men only ; where, in the name of brother-
hood, do the women come in ? Has the seam-
stress, who makes shirts for 16 hours a day and
7s. 6d. a week, got no rights in the matter?
The Bulletin would like to see N.S.W. Public
Service Board entrusted with the task of
retrenching the N.S.W. Public Works Com-
mittee, which conducts the most barefaced
public grab extant. Worse still, the steal is
one with which no Government is likely to
interfere, inasmuch as the P.W. Committee
system controls both the votes of those in
possession and of those expectant —the former
being more than sufficiently numerous and the
latter simply legion. The committee consists
of thirteen Ms. P.—the Devil’s number-
selected from the two Houses of Parliament;
the members get three guineas a sitting and
sit as often as ever they can, four times a week
(12 guineas) being a pretty regular thing, and
five times (15 guineas) not uncommon ; when
members are engaged on sectional committees
of the main body and go anywhere to inspect
proposed works they draw two guineas a day
regularly with travelling expenses added. The
regularity of their attendance is simply para-
lysing. A political wreck may be too ricketty
to crawl a yard under ordinary circumstances,
but when a committee-sitting is on he spends
money in an ambulance to fetch him to town
and dump him down at the committee-table in
order that his name may be inscribed on the
attendance-book as entitled to a fee ; and when
a strong blast of eucalyptus or iodoform is
wafted into the nose of the permanent Works
officials and loud crutch-clumps and coughs are
heard upon the stairs, the professional staff know
that poor, patriotic old Jobbleton is coming for
his “stuff.”
It would be desirable, in the interests of the
economics of horse-feed, wear-and-tear and
interest-on-capital, to know the whole particu-
lars of the Collingwood (Vic.) municipal con-
tracts for supply of man, horse and dray. In
one case it is said that the contract-price is
38s. 6d., and as the minimum wage of 6s. per
day is paid to the man, according to a docu-
ment signed both by the contractor and the
driver, this philanthropic dray-owner manages
to serve his country, feed his horse, shoe him,
risk his death, run a stable, repair his dray,
and receive his recompense as entrepreneur, on
2s. 6d. per week. Here surely lurks the philo-
sopher’s stone of economics. By the way, why
was objection taken in this council to requiring
a statutory declaration, instead of the present
unconvincing document, in such cases ?
Seduction, pure and simple, is not a wrong
known to the law. Whether it should be, is,
of course, arguable. But in some cases, by a
fiction, "heavy damages can be got against the
seducer. If a girl’s people are in sufficiently
comfortable circumstances to keep her at home,
she can be seduced with the certainty of getting
some compensation for the seduction. For her
father or mother can sue the man for the loss
of her services, although said services may
consist in bringing a cup of tea to her mother’s
room once a month or so. Once the alleged loss
is established, there is practically no limit to
the amount of damages obtainable—this being
one of the few cases in which vindictive dam-
ages are allowable. But, if she is a poor girl
sent out to work for a stranger in order that
her services may be really helpful to her home,
and the stranger’s son or visitor, or the stranger
himself, seduces her, she has no remedy at all,
because her parent cannot allege loss of services
in such circumstances. Here is a real woman’s
grievance, and it is pleasing to note that the
S.A. women’s-franchise crowd are questioning
M’sP. there re their willingness to have the
law altered.
The Kanakaland Elections.
Kanakaland Government is an adept in all dis-
honest artifices. Its Premier is head of a Political
Association formed to disfranchise democratic
voters —a conjunction which, as ,T. G. Drake says,
would be tolerated in no other community
governed on the lines of the British constitution.
A good deal of its energy is devoted to propping
with public money broken financial institutions in
which its supporters are deeply interested. After
careful enquiry into the politics of 3500 new voters
enrolled in January, who would be formally
entitled to vote in April, it decided that a
majority were probably opponents of its policy,
and advanced the current elections by a month
in order to rob these duly-qualified elec-
tors of their votes. At the same time,
it scattered the elections over the same month,
in accordance with time-dishonored principles of
political corruption, in order that its plural votes
might accumulate unrepresentative majorities, and
its de r e ited candidates might slink up many con-
venient backstairs. Already it is reaping the
harvest of its cunning. Thomas Joseph Byrnes,
its Attorney-General, routed at North Brisbane,
has ample time to succeed at Cairns—Burns,
Philp, and Co’s spittoon constituency, trebly-
mortgaged to the Govt.' bank, whose “mean
whites ’’ are spurned even by the Chinese who earn
their livings for them. Byrnes sat for Cairns in
the last Parliament, and explicitly said “ I will
never desert Cairns till Cairns deserts me,” and
Cairns humbly thanked him for the honor. Then
he thought he saw a chance of succeeding at North
Brisbane, and threw Cairns over without a word
of apology, and Cairns humbly thanked him for
the honor. Then the Govt, party at Cairns
chose Ernest Milford, a local solicitor, to repre-
sent it, and Byrnes sent up the parasitic little
Lissner as his nominee, so the party kicked out
Milford, crawled to lick Lissner’s boots, and
humbly thanked Byrnes for the honor. Now
Byrnes is beaten at North Brisbane, and, on the
whole, he thinks he will sit for Cairns again, and
Cairns will humbly thank him for the honor. As
for the independent manhood of the Cairns Govt,
party, one of the local banana-Chinamen could
easily put that in his opium-pipe and smoke it.
* * * •
The election which has reduced Thomas Joseph
Byrnes’s head in one act from the size of a prize-
pumpkin to that of a split pea has given the gods
more laughter than they have had for many a day.
There has been nothing like it since Parkes was
thrown out of East Sydney in ’B3 with a howl that
split the welkin. Yellow Pup fought Green Pup,
Paddy Mick struggled with Sandy Mac, and
Courier white-elephant was gloriously burst by
Telegraph white-elephant. Byrnes was deter-
mined to foist himself on North Brisbane —a very
conservative constituency of aged Tories—and
succeeded in getting the formal approval of his
party-chief. He forgot that, though one man
could lead the Political Ass to the green water,
twenty could not make its orange section drink.
And his rival and colleague, Horace Tozer—the
John Davies of Q. underground engineering, who
gained entrance to Parliament in ’BB by rousing
the Wide Bay Prodhestants to beat Catholic
John Elood—would indignantly deny that he was
hauling on the tail of the Yellow Animal
behind the scenes. So two pure Presbyterians—
Macdonald-Paterson and Bob Fraser—were forced
into the running. They claimed to be every bit
as good Ministerialists as Byrnes and Kingsbury;
and the Labor-party, which is learning tactics,
put up no candidate and gave them all its support.
The Courier shrieked wildly for Byrnes; the
Telegraph, at whose parson-ridden office the
Yellow Pup has a favorite kennel, shrieked still
more wildly against him. He was hampered
by alliance with Kingsbury a clever politi-
cal “bounder” whom M‘llwraith carried in
with him three years ago, but who has
never become popular, even with his own
side, and who lives always in the odor of
insincerity. Then there was a wide feeling that
“ Tommy ” was getting altogether too bumptious,
and that a snub would do him good ; while Pater-
son and Eraser, though absolutely “safe” men
from a Tory point of view, are not smirched
with the dirt of Boodlewraith—which even Q.
Tories occasionally eat with grimaces. Result—
Paterson, 1342 ; Fraser, 1252 (elected); Byrnes,
1157 ; Kingsbury, 1009 (gnashing teeth in outer
darkness). Defeat of the accredited Govt, candi-
dates ; comparative triumph for the Labor-party ;
and a very nasty pill for Bulcock and the Courier.
» * * *
So far, the Labor-party has done as well as it
expected. The first batch of elections—as per
another time-dishonored artifice—was arranged to
put in a good body of safe Government candi-
dates, and so encourage the others. As a nett
result, including half-a-dozen unopposed candi-
dates, the Labor-party puts five men in and
Government 26 ; while there are three in-
dependents. Labor-leader Glassey got in for
Bundaberg, beating Ministerialist Duffy. Bunda-
berg is a Kanaka centre, and the Govt, expected
a victory. But there has been k little too much
Kanaka lately—and here again the Yellow Pup
barked. Labor divided the seats at South Bris-
bane and Fortitude Valley, lost one at Ipswich,
and was beaten by four votes at Too-
wong, where one of its most valuable members,
Mat Reid, was defeated by an Independent new
man, Furney. Ogden was thrown out at Towns-
ville, and Powers’ retirement at Maryborough
gained the Ministerialists a seat. A good man
was narrowly beaten at Mackay—H. B. Black—
and Ministerialists Dalrymple and Chataway were
returned. “A peculiar feature” noted is that
“amongst the rejected candidates there are five
ex-members, all Govt, supporters, and all R. C’s,
including the Attorney-General. Among 26 Govt,
supporters elected there is not one R.C., and there
are only three R.C’s out of the 34 members
elected.” Good old Freemasonry !

The opera co. is doing a sunset blaze of
glory at Sydney Lyceum with “ In Town,” which,
taking it all round, is a good deal better a render-
ing than that given by the alleged Gaieties some
little time ago. The new Duke of Muffshire
in particular, and the new Captain Codding-
ton, and Muffshire’s son Clanside (Flo.
Young) are especially commendable. Miss Mari-
etta Nash makes a lovely and fiendishly agile call-
boy ; also May Pollard as the heroine is as beauti-
ful as a dream of Elysium. By the time these
remarks appear in print, however, “ In Town ”
will be a thing of the past, and after a particularly
special outbreak on Thursday night, which will
definitely close the season, the opera co. once more
vanishes over the horizon. The great and
wondrous “ Djin-Dj in ” commences on Saturday,
and if it is anything like the production it was in
Melbourne a few months ago it should be the most
dazzling thing of the Easter season. The Japanese
landscape has already arrived, and the earthquake
is on the way. Two other Sydney theatres are
preparing the biggest spectacle they know of for
this festive Easter-tide, and W. and M., by turn-
ing on “ Djin-Djin ” show that they have realised
the greatness of the emergency and have resolved
to keep ahead. Meanwhile the odds are some-
thing to one that Sydney can’t support four big
theatres and three small ones all at once next
month, and that one management, if not more,
must go down with a dull, sickening flop.
# * * *
Her Majesty’s (Sydney) does one conse-
cutive night of “ Monte Cristo ” on Saturday by
way of farewell to Dampier, who, with Miss
Dampier, Mrs. Marshall, and various others, are
leaving the big theatre for a Victorian tour.
Thereafter the bereaved co. breaks out into the
great military spectacle, “ Called to Arms.” On
this occasion the Ber-ritish flag will once more
wave triumphantly over heaps of dead, and the
routed enemy, after fully revealing his mean,
underhand character, will fly out of sight, and the
leading characters will be happily re-united, or
their innocence will be proved, or they will die
nobly in the face of immense odds, or recover
their lost child, or be restored to their ancestral
estates, or find the missing will, or something to
the same effect. The British flag is now waving
itself violently in the back part of the theatre to
get into condition for the effort.
* * * *
Bland Holt opens Sydney Royal on 4th
April, with a very large drama entitled “ One of
the Best.” Said drama has been a triumphant
success in Bull-land, and B. Holt backs it to prove
the biggest thing he has yet accomplished. There
is a gorgeous Highland regiment in it, and rumor
asserts that Bland Holt, Baker and other leading
characters appear in kilts and struggle with a fur-
tive, breezy petticoat through four long acts.
Miss Elizabeth Watson, the leading lady, sister of
the swan-like Henrietta, doesn’t appear in kilts,
■ which is much to be regretted. There is no actual
battle in this drama, though the British Flag
waves a good deal, but it is understood that if
there was a battle the low, degraded enemy would
be routed with great slaughter, as usual.
* * * *
A dramatic co., which insisted, contrary to
all evidence, on taking itself seriously, broke out
last week at Sydney Music Hall, and was still
there at time of writing. Its first production was
entitled “ Sydney Under the Limelight,” and
proved to be the “Two Orphans” localised and
brought up to date regardless of consequences.
The consequences were too awful for description.
Jacques, the wicked brother, was changed to John
Donald Haggard ; his principal accomplice was
Wilson Jones Boaker, and Mother Frochard
appeared on the bills as “Old Mother Hag Hag-
gard.” Another character was described as “the
man of to-day M.P.,” whatever that might be. The
two orphans arrived at Redfern Station, where the
one who wasn’t blind was abducted by John Donald
Haggard, assisted by Wilson Jones Boaker. The
cripple, who cleaned boots instead of running the
familiar knife-grinding machine (which possibly
wasn’t available), was a good deal larger and more
massive than his weedy big brother Jacques, and
Jacques in a belltopper and new suit didn’t cor-
respond at all with his beery she-parent and the
family attic. Jacques also did duty as the prin-
cipal nobleman in the gilded haunt of vice where
the abducted girl was taken, and when he loftily
offered to send “ ten of his people if necessary ” to
look for the blind girl it didn’t seem to fit in with
the 2s. 4d. he had just embezzled from his crippled
brother, and the threepenny beer he had had with
that walking disease, his parent. The gilded haunt
of vice was a solemn place where the dissipated
noblemen didn’t know what to do with their
hands and were much embarrassed by their feet.
The abducted girl was openly chloroformed by
John Donald Haggard and Wilson Jones Boaker
—at least, the writer believes it was Boaker—in
George-street, outside the railway station, and the
blind girl was left sitting on a carpet-bag in the
middle of the road, where she ought to have been
promptly run over by a tram-car, but wasn’t.
Later on, the blind girl was found singing, in what
seemed intended for a snowstorm outside St.
Mary’s Cathedral. The wild, mediaeval lawless-
ness of John Donald Haggard and Wilson Jones
Boaker broke out all over the drama, but ulti-
mately the former was knocked out, and what be-
came of Boaker this paper doesn’t remember.
The co. in general was too much agitated about
getting safely off the stage without falling over
itself to call for serious criticism.
* * * *
Later on John Donald Haggard and Wilson
J ones Boaker and the rest attacked ‘ ‘ East Lynne ”
and routed it with great slaughter, leaving much
dead grammar and decomposed pronunciation on
the field of battle. The version produced was a
new one apparently written with a hay-fork, and
it was played in a way quite different from any-
thing The Bulletin ever saw before. “ Oliver
Twist ” is to be staged next Saturday, and later on
the co. proposes to attack “ Hamlet,” which is
too old to defend itself and will probably collapse
in the first round. The Prince is to be repre-
sented by some one described in the bill as “ the
Young Rocni’s,” whoever he may be. Said bill,
however, is an irresponsible kind of document,
and probably it had bolted at the time this state-
ment appeared.
* * # *
The only notable change at the Tivoli is
that John Coleman is doing his last five nights,
and that the popular Miss Florrie Forde re-appears
for six nights only, and the Thornton Sisters nave
been added to the programme. The Opera House
has put up a new first part, called “ Moonlight
Revels,” which, considering that everybody who
went out in the moonlight of late has had to revel
under an umbrella, seems hardly so well-timed as
it might be.
* * * *
A choice Gabbettian edition of “ His
Natural Life ” was published at Melb. Alexandra
on Saturday, and received with awful delight by a
gasping multitude. Manager Dan. Barry’s talent
in “ catering for his special class of patrons” is
proverbial. He reads their innermost souls, and
knows exactly what they want. When in a posi-
tion to treat them to a full meal of mutilated
corpse D.B. serves it up with plenty of pepper and
blood sauce. The bill of fare abounds in appe-
tising details: “A floating hell,” “ Gabbett, the
man-eater,” “150 lashes for chewing tobacco,”
“the famished man-eater,” “the blood-reeking
triangles—the lash—flogged almost to death,” “a
hideous instrument of torture—nine hours agony, ”
in addition to sweets and cheese.
* * • »
A super., purporting to be the real original
Gabbett, brought over from Tasmania at vast ex-
pense, figures among the chain-gang and chews
the cud of bogus bygone-banquet reflection. No
horror has been left unturned in the production
of this masterpiece of cold meat. The working
Gabbett (not the amusing scarecrow) is a brawny
tragedian, steeped in chalk and red ochre, who
seems always on the point of smattering some-
body’s brains with an uplifted axe. He makes
fifteen attempts to cleave Dora Mostyn (the Crow)
in twain when he gets her alone in the bush, but
Dora pleads for fair play on the ground that she
has little or no flesh on her bones, whereas he has
been fattening on the defunct “ Moocher ” (whose
sole remaining leg lies festering in the sun behind
the scenes), and at last Gabbett consents to decide
the question at issue by drawing straws. Dora
wins this draw, nevertheless the dishonorable
beast of prey flourishes his chopper as before.
Then he rampages off to find the Moocher’s leg,
leaving his young friend to soliloquise upon her
approaching doom. Clever Miss Mostyn certainly
holds possession of the house just here. In her
mind’s eye she sees Gabbett devouring the Moo-
cher’s lungs, liver, and pleurisy, and lapping up
the crimson gore as it drips from the Moocher’s
heart. An actress who can talk of such private
matters to a deadly silent audience, and make
them whistle for more after she has crawled out of
sight, is a valid excuse for prolonging “ His
Natural Life ” into next week, or even further. It
seems probable that Miss Mostyn will hear Gab-
bett’s back teeth crunching through the Moocher’s
collar-bone for several nights to come.
* * * *
At the Princess’s a round of popular revi-
vals is bringing the B. and B. season to an end.
Arrangements as follows : to-night (Thursday)
“Rebellious Susan,” on Friday “The Idler,” on
Monday and Tuesday next week “Mrs. Tan-
queray,” followed by one night each of “Dandy
Dick” and “The Magistrate.” Saturday next
at the Princess’s has been reserved for the
farewell benefit of Mr. Boucicault, now about
to dissolve his partnership with Mr. Brough
and leave a grateful country to mourn his
departure. The Bulletin would like to
dilate upon the claims of the junior B. to all the
benefit which Melbourne can afford, but a lump
in the throat of this soft-hearted journal forbids
further utterance on the subject. Nor is there
any need to remind Melbourne of its old friend’s
theatrical services. Boucicault is very dear to all
admirers of artistic work, and, on the occasion of
his complimentary benefit, nobody worth mention-
ing will fail to be present in the flesh, except those
people who, being unable to procure standing-
room, will merely get there in the spirit. Fortu-
nately, the space available for spirit accommoda-
tion is unlimited.
* * * *•
“The Silence of Dean Maitland” took
some pains to make a poor start at Melb. Royal.
Tuesday, instead of Saturday, was chosen for the
first performance, whereat the last act of this
grief-stricken drama was considerably weakened
by the omission of a front scene. The leading
man pitched his remorse in too low a key, and the
newspapers next morning committed fewer com-
plimentary perversions of the truth than might
have been expeoted. Circumstances were un-
favorable to the show at the outset, therefore its
present efforts to redeem the past and build tip a
decent reputation deserve all the friendly
oouragement they are likely to get. j
of Dean Maitland ” is a fairly intelligent and
quite intelligible adaptation of a clever novd. any-
way. Also, it is sufficiently well acted in some
parts to be interesting.
* * * *
A brisk, crisp, vigorous stage story was
not constructible out of the book sm& j
Everybody who appears in the proiogue is doomed
to die, disappear, or grow old before the finish.
The survivors are turned grey by grief, and a fine
chance for the introduction of somebody s patent
hair restorer is lost for ever. Eighteen yearsof
human suffering happen between the acts, and
the flight of time is unduly emphasised by the in-
troduction of a small young man who was unborn
when the curtain rose. The Bulletin must pro
test against this late arrival. He is ta,me and un-
necessary. A letter to the effect that he was
waiting round the corner, ready to burst into
notice unless his illegitimate father gave him
money to stay away with, would be preferable to
his presence. Probably the audience would sub-
scribe for him to remain absent if they were
warned of what they might otherwise expect.
* '* * *
King Hedley—better to say Mr. King
Hedley, since he isn’t a reigning monarch—
interprets the difficult character of Dean Maitland
with a little force and much discretion. Consider-
ing that he is an amorous, cowardly hypocrite in
the prologue, and a weak-minded apostle during
the next two acts, Hedley may be congratulated
on his rather likeable performance. He wears the
cloth of piety with an air of penitence and stands
fully 6ft. high. His final confession of sins in
front of the pasteboard altar is well spoken.
One listens to him all the time without smil-
ing, and feels almost sorry when he drops
dead. Miss Maud Williamson comes out strong
as the Dean’s depressed sister, Cyril Keightley is
an impressive victim of mistaken identity, barring ,
a slight disposition to “ twang,” and Edith Kelly
makes a good, garrulous old villager. Also, Miss
Polly Emery, in a child character, is a ray of sun-
shine. Some other people help to carry the matter
through, and the scenery goes on its merits, which
are considerable. “The Silence of Dean^ Mait-
land,” although announced to close on Friday,
will run awhile into next week, if the public give
the word.
** * *
The cold criticism dealt out by the Mel-
bourne morning papers to “The Silence of Dean
Maitland ” was, in a relative sense, very unfair.
The Theatre Royal show, at popular prices, is
much more praiseworthy than a hundred other
ventures which the same unreliable journals have
given encouraging notices to. But because it
happens to have been adapted from a powerful
novel it is judged by that novel (which nine-tenths
of the audiences know nothing about) instead of
being compared with the ordinary blood-and-
thunder melodrama, and judged by the golden
rule of “ so much advt., so much marmalade.” No
Melbourne daily newspaper can conscientiously
disparage any theatrical production nowadays,
seeing that none can be inferior to the belauded
shows presented at the Royal, and other houses,
within the past five years.
** * *
The cathedral scene in “The Silence of
Dean Maitland,” as played at Melb. Royal, can’t
possibly impress anyone acquainted with cathedral
pomps and vanities. A surpliced choir, consisting
of six men, sits facing the pulpit instead of way
back in the chancel, whilst the Dean’s blind son
figures, in a black velvet suit and a front pew, as
the sole solo choir-boy, and starts the service by
singing, “ Come, all ye faithful.” After which the
Dean strikes up a personal yam to the congrega-
tion, just as though he were a little Bethel shep-
herd who had forgotten to open the proceedings
with prayer. The scene is unnecessarily absurd.
For a couple of sovereigns they might have got a
verger to come in and stage-manage it to much
better advantage.
At Poverty Point .
The lately-deceased Marius caused a lady to be twice
divorced.
At boom-time plans were drawn for new Melb. theatres,
in Bourke-street and Collins-street.
Haresfoot: “I am not surprised at your anecdote of
G. V. Brooke preaching. Like most vinous Thespians he
was profoundly religious.”
Paradis : “ What an unsurpassable drama, in its way.lis
‘ Fedora ’! It is all action. Give the players the scenario
and they could fill in words, after the style of Richardson’s
Show. Not an ounce of superfluous cackle. No purple
patches. Nothing so absurd as Romeo’s description of
the Apothecary’s Shop to interrupt the development.”
Clifton Alderson, acting, it is supposed, for Geo. Rig-
nold, wanted badly to buy the Australian and Indian
rights of “ The Strange Adventures of Mrs. Brown,” but
he was too late, as the piece had been secured by Frank
Thornton (writes Tub Bulletin’s London correspondent),
whom you will see anon down under in this remarkably
funny piece, which as a laughter-maker is only excelled
by “ Charley’s Aunt.” Fred. Kerr, who owns the piece,
refused many offers, being determined that no one should
have it for Australia but the gay Frank, who undoubtedly
will make the most of it, though it is possible that he will
not play Kerr’s part, but that of the detective, which is
extremely funny.
The Hopetoun-visaged James Wood, a well-known Mel-
bourne tenor vocalist, is now at Glasgow—resting. Aus-
tralians anxious to write their “ name on the scroll of
fame, ’ and get well paid for doing so, should remember
that “ London is the market for real ability—but a starva-
tion workhouse for mediocrity.” Though this advice in
no way applies to Wood.
The claque , of which Coleman complains in Melbourne,
is an established accessory of some of the London music-
halls. At the Empire, especially, performers complain
bitterly of the blackmail thus extorted from them
amounting in some cases to £2 per week.
A leading bass in the Carl Rosa Co. is another valuable
export from Australasia to London’s fogs. Harry Pringle
is a Tasmanian, over 6ft., and a manly, handsome man.
He has been in England eight years, and is married to a
pretty little prima-donna.
The yarn about Teddy Lonnen’s capture and imprison-
ment by the Boers was all flam, being merely a specimen
of Mr. Lonnen’s funny ways.
Re Phil. Greenwood’s testimonial. Clifford Ferley as
hon. sec., got in for Phil, over 70 guineas* and J. C Wil-
liamson paid his passage to England.
Frank Cates’s health has given way, and to give his
lungs a chance he must have a sea-voyage, for which
purpose a testimonial movement is afoot. His voice is
almost entirely gone. Cates has long been out of luck.
Bland Holt’s tour through Maoriland has added materi-
ally to his cash in hand, and the company—especially
Walter Baker—seems to have “put on flesh.’ 5
Marie Elster has accepted a year’s engagement with the
Neilson Opera Co., now touring the English provincial
towns. “ Maritana,” “Faust," “Bohemian Girl,” “ H
Trovatore,” and “Daughter of the Regiment” are the
operas she has starred in up to date, and the press says
sweet things of the new lady from Australia.
Plain Bill Holloway and Charles Arnold were running
opposition shows at Johannesburg when the Jamieson
“invasion” happened. Two members of Arnold’s co.,
fearing that the Boers would sweep into the town and
shoot everybody down “ like rabbits,” made a bolt of it,
and were proclaimed traitors by the more valiant mum-
mers who stuck to the Flag, dontcherknow.
The divorce, in London, of Harry Atkinson (Fitts),
“ The Australian Orpheus,” by his wife, daughter of W.
K. Thomson, of Melbourne, is just announced. Another
love-partnership ends in bankruptcy and .dissolution.
Nine or ten years ago Harry was a slim, gentle-mannered
youth, with a long, silky moustache, and sang in the
church choir. Now he is a stout, coarse, clean-shaved
“ bounder,” with the manners, style, and language of the
music-halls, where his “turns” are almost as good and
as well received as ever.
Charles Clark, first and best of the lecture brigade, has
sailed for Melbourne, where he will begin his farewell
Australian tour about the middle of April. He has
written two new lectures for his last run round.
Kissing goes by favor. “It was long ago,” says a New
York paper, “ that Apple Mag of the Herald was under
orders to ‘ write up ’ Mme. Melba on every possible occa-
sion, and it was plain, from a look at Tuesday’s issue, that
these orders are still in force. The true story of their
earliest propagation has been familiar to the inner circle
for some time past. It appears that, two or three years
back, Mme. Melba met Mr. Bennett on a yacht owned by
a mutual friend. The newspaper proprietor made the
acquaintance of the prima-donna, and promised her that,
should she ever visit the States, the Herald should be at
her disposal. When Mme. Melba sailed for New York she
thought it unnecessary to remind Mr. Bennett of his
kindly offer, and the result was that her early perform-
ances were treated with extreme brutality by Apple Mag.
Mme. Melba bore with this condition of things for some
days, but she finally yielded to the advice of friends and
cabled to Mr. Bennett. The outcome of this move was a
clear change of tack on the part of the Herald, and, ever
since, Apple Mag has raved with the same heartiness over
Mme. Melba’s happiest, as over her feeblest, achieve-
ments.”
Madame Melba’s recent concert-tour in America was
such an extraordinary financial success that she could, it
is said, retire on the proceeds, a rich woman. She sings
in Paris during May, and goes to England in June, the
chief prima - donna of the world’s greatest operatic
organisation.
Since Fuller Maitland, of the Times, alluded to Ada
Crossley as the first contralto in England all the minor
critics have been busy placing her in front of Clara Butt,
the only singer in England who can come near the Aus-
tralian.
Melba’s secretary and companion, Miss Louie Bennett,
was married at New York on 14th Jan. to Mr. Kenyon
Mason, a young member of London Stock Exchange.
Besides being the devoted prot6g6e of the great singer,
the bride has other claims on Australian interest, for she
was born in Melbourne —Mr. Henry Bennett being her
father, Chief Justice Madden her cousin, and
Dr. O’Hara, her uncle. Melba invited young Mason
to America to see his sweetheart, and when the time
for parting came the hostess vowed she would make
them both happy, and gave them a wedding. Dr. Corri-
gan, the R.C. Archbishop of New York, conducted the
ceremony, which was privately celebrated in his draw-
ing-room, owing to the bridegroom not professing
the R.C. faith of his bride. A breakfast followed in
the smartest suite of rooms at the Savoy Hotel.
The place was a dream of flowers, crystal, and silver, and
the menus lovely little bells bearing medallion portraits
of the bride and bridegroom. All the members of the
Italian Opera Co., including Madame Frances Saville,
were at the breakfast, for which Melba smilingly paid
£5OO, and in addition she gave the bride a cheque for
£2OO and a grand piano. Mr. and Mrs. Henry Abbey’s
present was a suite of rooms on the promenade deck of
the steamer Paris, en route to Europe. Melba’s gown at
the ceremony was a most remarkable but lovely confection
of peach satin with turquoise velvet. With this she wore
a very large black Gainsborough hat, having waving
plumes, and her famous turquoises and diamonds. The
White Hungarian Band made its first appearance in New
York at the wedding, which Melba had carried out strictly
en princestse.
One of the most popular of Australia’s few clever
actresses is playing speaks with hubby again after being
“ out ” for years. Hubby has been “ resting ” assiduously
of late.
The most palpable absurdity of “The Silence of Dean
Maitland,” as put up at Melbourne Royal, is the distribu-
tion of gifts in the second act. A tired audience sits in
deep dejection for about a quarter of an hour, whilst the
Dean is fishing paper parcels out of a handbag, and deal-
ing them round to a pack of youngsters whos? enthusiasm
is suggestive of the vivacity of a dead frog. This is Art.
Oscar Wilde’s “ A Woman of No Importance,” and
Pinero’s latest, “ The Benefit of the Doubt,” are being
kept for the B. & B. season at Sydney Cri.
Marshall Hall, the Melb. musical professor, was fined
2s. fid. for biking along a footpath at Mornington (Vic.)
last week. He has been running classical-music concerts
for years past, and has so far met with no punishment,
yet the day he turns his jigger from a lumpy, sandy
alleged road on to a smooth but deserted path he is visiter!
with fine or gaol. Inscrutable are the ways of civilised
man.
Beryl Faber, of the B. & B. Co., returns to London per
same steamer as Boucicault. She has a brother and sister
in the “perfesh”—C. A. Smith, whilom-cricketer, with
John Hare in the U.S., and Miss Faber, who played Lady
Montague recently in “ Romeo and Juliet,” with Forbes
Robertson and “Mrs. Pat.” Beryl Faber has only been
playing four years. She goes back to George Alexander,
at London St. James’s.
George Rignold opens a season of six months at Melb.
Royal Aug. 1. He has a fine list of new' plays.
Absolutely the best-played character in B. and B.’s
“ Fedora” was that of the coachman, who spoke one word
—“ Ipanoff ! ” —in a quite convincing style. A lot of
execution can be done with one word, carefully fired off.
For instance, Miss Oliffe's nervous “Yes!” in the Mas-
queraders,” when the astronomer-person asked her if she
was willing to let her husband stake her on a game ol
cards.

Merrail’s Hydraulic Quartz Mill,
a very recent American invention, is being intro-
duced into Australia by A. G. Mitchell & Co., 118
The Strand, Sydney. The Mill has had many
trials, and has proved every time that it will
revolutionise the mining industry. It reduces the
hardest rock to pulp with phenomenal rapidity ; a
sft. Mill requires from 5 to 8 h.p., and crushes
from 15 to 25 tons every 24 hours; a 6ft. Mill
requires from 8 to 12 h.p., and crushes from 25 to
60 tons —the variation in the respective quantities
is due solely to the fineness of the screen. No. 10
stamp battery with its 10 h.p. can do more than
half the work of a 6-foot Mill. Wear and tear is
very small. The same firm are agents for THE
GOLD KING AMALGAMATOR, another
American invention which is fast displacing the
plates ; if used after the plates it saves all the fine
gold which otherwise would pass away in the tail-
ings. It pays for itself in a few weeks ; New
Zealanders attest—“lt saves every speck of gold
and mercury.’’ It will enable the beach miner
to make twice his present catch. Trials will take
place shortly; meanwhile, send for pamphlets and
particulars.

The examination into the affairs of the City of
Melbourne Bank stands adjourned sine die. It was a
lively examination whilst it lasted, and the evidence
which is now in course of transit to England will doubt-
less be received with howls by a special meeting 1 of
depositors. And when those distant victims have vented
some more of their feelings in another burst of noise, and
the chairman has duly commented upon Judge Moles-
worth’s “ scathing remarks,” there will be an end of the
matter, The Bulletin supposes. The Federal Bank
directors were examined some months, or years, a°-o.
They made a number of awful disclosures, and the Judge
passed a lot of scathing remarks, also the lawyers charged
terribly long bills for working up the job, and the
Court adjourned sine die. The rest was silence. If
there had ever been anywhere an intention to pro-
secute the Federal directors that intention was pre-
sumably, withered by a cold blast of Smellbourne legal
advice. If the Hinglish depositors propose to seri-
ously harry hon. Thomas Loader & Co. (who have the
advantage of a dead manager to dump responsibility
upon) legal advice may be expected to strike the sugges-
tion dumb. In short, this examination, like the former
examination, was a ghastly farce. It started with the
alleged purpose of discovering whether “something ought
to be done,” and haying elicited the fact that the afore-
said “something” is desirable, it will arrive at the
conclusion that nothing can be done.
* * » *
Among the directors of the exploded City of
Melbourne Bank there seems to be a beautiful unanimity
on at least one point. Everybody seems to be agreed that
almost all the very wrong things were done by Colin
Longmuir, the man that’s dead. The wickedness of the
man that’s dead is a truly painful thing to contemplate.
The Mutual Life Assurance Society of Victoria
holds its annual meeting on the 30th March, when Thomas
Loader (of the famous City of Melbourne Bank) offers him-
self for re-election as a director. Considering the awful
Story of ignorance, neglect, crass stupidity, incompetence
and sinful muddlement that Mr. Loader recently told about
himself at the City Bank inquiry, his gall in asking any-
body to re-elect him a director of anything is sublime.
And if the policy-holders re-elect Loader after reading his
own account of himself, they deserve anything that can
happen to them. The spectacle of Loader on the direc-
torate should be sufficient to scare any intelligent insurer
away from the office.

The old, solid Union Bank reports that the half-
year’s profits are £36,062, against £37,172 for the last half-
year, and £44,676 and £44,132 for the two previous halves.
This is the smallest profit which the Union has reported
for many years past. The 5 per cent, dividend absorbs
£37,500, so that even this humble percentage, like
the three preceding dividends, hasn’t been fairly earned,
and for the fourth time in succession the div. is made up
by taking a few hundreds from the previous balance. The
Union has between £4,000,000 and £5,000,000 cash on
hand, and is apparently paralysed by its enormous dead
weight of gold. A bank which keeps all its capital and
reserve fund, the full amount of its note circulation, and
over £1,000,000 of its deposits lying idle in the cellar, may
be a good concern for an invading army to plunder, but
as a dividend-producing machine it is bound to be below
par.

The N.S.W. land and income-tax has proved a
blessing to the great tribe of seedy brokers, financial
agents, commission agents, and other people who
live by lurking mysteriously in an office in com-
pany with a battered table and two chairs. They
are all busy advertising their willingness to fill
up your schedule for ss. or more—in cases of very
complicated land-tax schedules the charge is anywhere
from ss. to £lO, or even £2O. Many people are badgered
and harried into the impression that these more or Ipss
mouldy persons are licensed by Government, and that
unless one of them fills up the tax-paper it will inevitably
be all wrong, and the result will be three months’ gaol, so
the sharks, many of whom know no more about the Act
than their clients, are prospering greatly. There is
hardly any kind of incident or event or calamity that the
financial agent won’t advise you about for 10s. 6d. or
eighteen-pence. If the Day of Judgment were at hand
the cheap and threadbare agent would charge 7s. 6d. for
explaining it to you.

The Sydney Land Bank and Financial Agency
00., a concern which has for some time past led a pre-
carious existence in the wilds of Castlereagh-street with
no visible means of support worth mentioning, decided to
liquidate the other day. Said “bank” in its later days
was only a wreck on a rock, and the uselessness of trying
to look as if it was afloat became at last too apparent to
be disguised any longer.

The Standard Fire and Marine Insurance Co.,
the smallest of the four big Maoriland offices, has gathered
in £73,858 of premiums during the year, and interest on
investments (£4339) and other items makes a total income
of £78,222. The nett profit, however, is exactly £5134,
and as £4339 of this is interest on the co’s own funds,
and £25 consists of share transfer fees, it follows that this
big insurance business has only yielded £770 of profit.
As the board hadn’t the moral courage to cut down its 7J
per cent. div. to 5 per cent., it pays £5625 to the share-
holders ; and, as this amount won’t come out of £5134,
the difference is taken from last year’s balance. Consider-
ing the precarious nature of fire and marine business,
this is a very solemn thing to do, especially as the income
from investments has dropped by £6OO in two years, the
nett premiums have fallen £4OOO since ’92, and the actual
profit of the insurance business has gone down steadily
from £13,000 in ’92 to £6BOO in ’93, £3500 in ’94, and now,
in ’95, to £77o—which is a hair-raising series of drops.
The Standard struck an awful snag in 1880-82, when its
dividends stopped and its reserve-fund mostly vanished,
and the co. itself seemed likely to fade off the face of the
earth. Since then it has been having a good time on the
whole and has rebuilt its reserve; but another streak of
bad luck appears to be coming along, therefore the desire
to pay 7i per cent, dividends, when the year’s earnings
are only 6ij per cent., should be suppressed till the clouds
roll by.

Dear Bulletin, —Re City Mutual on 29th Sept.,
1594, vou wrote thus“ In reference to the remarks
made in last week’s Bulletin, as to the relative expenses
of various Australian life-insurance societies, there is one
aspect of the case which was, perhaps, not made suffi-
ciently clear. A large part of an insurance office’s ex-
penses consists of commissions and medical charges con-
nected with new policies. Business is expensive to acquire,
but costs, or should cost, comparatively little to retain
when once secured. Therefore, the expenses of a new
office where a very large proportion of the business is in
this initiatory stage, are generally greater than those of
an old one, and an institution which does a large new
business usually shows a larger expense account than one
which is less progressive. Last year the City Mutual had
by far the largest expense account among Australasian
insurance offices; but in proportion to its size its new
business was three times as large as that of the Mutual of
victoria, and considerably larger than that of the A.M.P.
or Colonial Mutual, or even the National Mutual, which
comes second on the list in this respect. Also, the City
Mutual reports the largest percentage of interest on its
nvested funds—about £6 Bs. per cent., against the other
offices average of £5 175.” Those remarks apply with equal
orce to-day. The City Mutual’s new business each year
snows a steady increase, and with one solitary exception
it is the only office which during the past few years records
a steady yearly increase in its renewal income. The City
Alutual has one of the soundest connections in the pro-
vince, and it may be of interest to learn that it is the only
Australian life office which periodically submits its figures
..I'.® scrutiny of an actuarial authority unconnected
with its staff.—Geo. Crowley.
The statements quoted by Mr. Crowley are as
true to-day as when they were written. The City Mutual
has the largest expense account, and also the largest
proportion of new business ; and, as new business
is vastly more expensive than renewal business,
the one partly accounts for the other. But, in
instituting a comparison between the City Mutual
and the A.M.P., let it be assumed that all the expense is
attached to the new business and that the renewals cost
absolutely nothing—an absurd assumption, of course, but
one which gives all the advantage to the City. In that
case the A.M.P. pays £166,000 expenses to earn £104,000
of income, and the City Mutual pays £10,197 to earn
£4577, which shows the latter’s expenses, even on new
business, to be a great deal the heavier of the two.
Therefore, The Bulletin adheres to its belief that
the expense rate of the City Mutual is a great deal too
heavy, and that every other office doing business in
Australasia, except the A.M.P. and the Maoriland
Government Department, is in the same condition.
Also, the question of expense doesn’t touch the main con-
tentions -that the City Mutual’s ordinary life rates are so
small that they may one day prove too low ; that the offer
°[ ,r> psr cent, interest in certain cases is taking a consider-
able risk ; and that there is a curious discrepancy in the
tontine estimates. Also, it makes no difference in the great
fact that there are far more life assurance offices in Aus-
tralia than the country wants, and that excessive compe-
tition is keeping the expense-rate dangerously high.

Editor Bulletin, — In answer to the queries in
your issue of 7th instant we would state : -Ist. The num-
ber of shares taken up in the firm of W. F. Coxon and
Co., Ltd., bv an applicant depends entirely on his qualifi-
cations. We pay from 20s. to 30s. per [sic.] and 15
per cent, commission (we can show where good men earn
£5 to £8 per week). 2nd and 3rd. We have not had one
instance where a man has been discharged, had his salary
cut down, or been discharged to make room for another
man. We do our best to encourage and assist our em-
ployes. 4th. A shareholder in this co. has the same
privileges as a shareholder in any other concern has in
his co. sth. The capital of the co. is 112,000 in shares of
£1 each (payable as per prospectus). These shares can
be disposed of at their face value. The co. is managed by
a board of directors, who meet monthly. Mr. W. F.
Coxon is the managing director, and any information
concerning the company will be gladly given on applica-
tion to the head office, 145 Phillip-street, Sydney—Yours
truly, W. F. Coxon and Co., Ltd.. Geo. A. Wallace,
secretary.

[The Bulletin has also received a copy of the
articles of association, but as these begin at page 17 and
71 rules are missing the document is not very explicit. So
far as can be made out, however, it seems that “ no mem-
ber holding less than 10 shares has a vote,” so apparently
the small shareholder has no say whatever in the manage-
ment of the co.—which is a remarkable commentary on
the statement that “a shareholder in this co. has the
same privilege as a shareholder in any other concern.”
Also, it seems that the previous head of the firm (the man
who sold the business to the co.) is fixed as managing-
director for life and can’t be removed by the shareholders.
There are three directors besides this permanent person,
and all the four seem to have been appointed by them-
selves, or by the managing boss, or by somebody quite
apart from the mass of shareholders, and as they are only
to retire at the rate of one a year it will be three years
before the shareholders can control a majority of the
board—if the provision shutting out small shareholders
from voting allows them ever to do so. Also, the
directors retain power to invest the co’s money in land
and other things, and to convey any property of the com-
pany to trustees of their own appointment, and to do
various other interesting things.]

The S.A. 3 per cent, loan recently floated in
London sold nominally at £97 4s. lid. From this must be
deducted 15s. Id., accrued interest and the usual
expenses, so that the amount actually realised is not
much over £95. At this rate it costs the State about £3
Bs. per cent, allowing for the loss at redemption ; and if
allowance is made for the cost of remitting the interest
for 20 years and the cost of humping the money back
when the loan is repaid, wjiich it presumably will be some
day, there is) very little to choose between a nominal 3
per cent, loan in London and a 3£ per cent, loan floated
locally. Last year S.A. offered a 31 per cent, loan in
Adelaide, and was rushed with far more money than it
required. Interest was then higher and money scarcer
than it is now, and Adelaide is not nearly so
full of surplus coin as Melbourne and Sydney; and
considering these circumstances it doesn’t seem as if the
Kingston Government had gained anything at all by sell-
ing its securities in England instead of in Australia, and
making the load of foreign indebtedness a little bigger,
and keeping up the old dreary ruinous fiction that Aus-
tralia can’t get on without leaning on British capital. The
one intelligent feature in the business is that the Govern-
ment retains the right to redeem the loan any time be-
tween 1916 and 1926, so it can’t be compelled to convert
on ruinous terms in a falling market. Otherwise the
Kingston finance is about the usual kind that Fat Man
Governments have been supplying for many years past.

Sample of evidence in the Western (N.S.W.)
station rent-reappraisement cases : “ Losses of stock (on
Cobham Lake) had been heavy. Since 1891 the lambs had
totalled 78,300 the niimber of dead or missing sheep was
72,000, so that the net' increase for five years was 6000
head.” On Corona, in the same neighborhood, the land-
ings in the last five years have amounted to 98,000 ; the
losses in the same period have been 84,000.

S.A. Brewing Co., on the year, has made
£28,260 16s. 6d.—a decent profit from the biggest beer-
drinking province in Australasia. Adding the previous
year’s balance, the co. has £34,985 11s. Bd. to play on, so
pays a 7 per cent, div., making 14 per cent, for the year,
writes off £lO,OOO odd debentures and £650 on leaseholds,
and carries forward £6014 155., some £lO,OOO below the ’94
figures. Climatic devilries account for the drop in profits.

The balance-sheet of the Cheque Bank (of
London) shows a net profit for 1895 of £14,172, against
£5323 in £1894. The dividend and bonus are at the rate
of per cent, on ordinary shares, and 12.) per cent, on
founders’ shares : £5OOO is carried to a reserve-fund, and
£2461 remains to credit of profit and loss. The Cheque
Bank has a paid-up capital of £84,702, and an uncalled
capital of £132,648.
The Civil Service Co-operative Society of N.S.W.
finished its 49th half-year on 31st Jan. The cash receipts
were £41,372, an increase of £5322 on the previous half-
year ; and the net profits, after providing for depreciation,
working expenses, &c., were £3273 equal to over 90 per
cent, per annum on the modest paid-up capital. Share-
holders get a dividend of 10 per cent, per annum on their
shares, 2s. in the £ on their cash purchases, and 9d. in the
£ on monthly accounts, and £5Ol is carried forward. The
C.S. Co-operative Society has had a long career of suc-
cess, as the result of good management and consistent
laying to its book. It has now a capitai of £6993, a re-
serve fund of £11,500, £1490 accumulated out of un-
claimed dividends, and, against £27,490 worth of assets,
its total liabilities to the public are only £3845.

Hot coals from Coolgardie Review :—“ Men
who are now rioting in luxury in London on money made
out of Coolgardie frauds, ought to be rotting in gaol with
white-fingered rascals like Jabez Balfour. Men who are
piling up wealth in holy Adelaide, ought to be piling up
stones in Yatala Stockade, and some whom we know in
Perth, fattening on oysters and champagne, ought, if they
had their deserts, to be picking oakum in Fremantle.”
* « * *
Judging by present appearances, it is quite pos-
sible that the VVestralian gold-returns for 1896 will show
little improvement even on the miserable returns
of 1895. Bayley’s gave 5000 oz. in the first half of ’95 and
only 2000 oz. in the second, and it seems now wholly
dead as a gold-producer. The Star of the East died, to all
intents and purposes, last August. All the mines that
contributed large amounts to the aggregate gold-yield are
flickering out, or have already flickered, save the Great
Boulder alone, and who will guarantee the Great Boulder?
It is not for want of crushing-power—in the Coolgardie
district alone 10 batteries out of 12 are lying idle—it is
simply want of gold. Moreover, much of the gold that
was procured cost more than its value to obtain, and when
the British shareholders get tired of paying the difference,
quite a lot of mines must needs go bung. There are some
£40,000,000 of foreign capital to pay dividends on, and all
the gold won in all Westralia last year, if every penny of
it went to foreign companies, and there were no workmen
to pay, no crushing expenses, no charges whatever, is
equal to just about 2 per cent, dividend per annum. After
allowing for expenses, it is less than 0 per cent. City
of Melbourne Bank deposits promise better than that.
* * * *
Will the Coolgardie papers reprint the articles
on W.A. goldfields that recently appeared in Sydney
Daily Telegraph? They were written by a very straight
man who knows what he talks about, combines practical
mining knowledge with knowledge of journalism, and has
been out there as a mining manager for the last 18 months.
What have they to say of this? “There are at leasts
dozen crushing plants at convenient points; the aggregate
is not less than 120 stampers ; there is abundance of water
to keep going continuously. But out of the 12 batteries
only two are now at work —Bayley’s South 10 stampers
and Londonderry 5 stampers. The rest, like the party in
the parlor, are ‘ all silent and all damned.’ These plants
cost an enormous sum of money, and it is a pity that they
should be idle. There are tens of thousands of tons of quartz
available, but divested of their patches as they have been
the lodes are not payable under present conditions.”
* * • •
A glance at the Adelaide share-list shows how
badly W.A. stocks have got the “ pip.” Where the Feb.
list spread four inches, the March one has shrunk to two.
The holy city will have to grow considerably before it can
stand a lengthened wild-cat boom.
• * * *
All efforts to drawHerrSchmeisserandDr.Vogel-
sang, the German mining experts, on the subject of their
ideas re Westralian and other Australasian fields have been
utterly hopeless. The pump was applied in Sydney the
other day—but as well ask a canned oyster to recite the
Ten Commandments as those learned Deutschers to give
an opinion.
* » * *
The very latest excuse is that Bayley’s Reward
collapsed, not from want of gold in the mine, but for want
of funds to get it out. Not enough capital, in fact. If
the gold in the great show-mine of Westralia won’t pay
for getting itself out, what kind of a goldfield is that pro-
vince, anyhow?
* * * *
The Coolgardie Mining Review : —“ The Bul-
letin denies the existence of good mines in and around
the town of Coolgardie, but the Australasian, owned and
worked by the brainy French investor, Dr. Simon, can
give the lie direct to the Sydney newspaper.” We are
told that 20 tons have gone 6oz. to the ton, and the future
is based on that average. And “ it lies about two miles
from the Coolgardie post-office.” Alas, how many alleged
mines have lied within two miles of Coolgardie? After
reading Coolgardie papers, one would even think that the
post-office itself would have to be pulled down for the sake
of the richness of the mine it covered. Wanted, a list of
the other rich mines, say within 10 miles of the post-office
—rich in respect to current crushings and divs., and not
merely in regard to what they are going to do, in the
opinion of the newspaper-men who have to earn their oats
(and thistles) on the spot. The Bulletin sincerely hopes
the Australasian will turn out well, for Dr. Simon and Co.
deserve it. They gave £40,000 cash for the New Vic-
toria, and—what do the late owners think of it ?
The reef seems to have turned dog ; and the Hill End
mine, for which £25,000 was given, and which, so far, has
returned so well, is not looking like a long-lived mine.
* * * *
At last a crushing is promised from the Mari-
tana, W.A.—lOO tons are to be sent to the Leviathan
battery, which has now plenty of water, and is ready to
crush any mine’s ore, having none of its own.
* * * *
“An extraordinary shoot of gold” has been
struck in the Maori mine, Menzies, W.A. Nothing is
called a patch in W.A., but bitter experience has proved
that nearly everything extraordinarily rich yet found
there has been a small pocket or a short-lived patch.

S.A. Govt. Geologist Brown says of the im-
mediate vicinity of Coolgardie : “ There is no likelihood
of artesian water being found by boring in uptilted and
faulted rocks such as these.” He believes that in the
deeper portions of the tertiary formations, occupying
wide areas of the flat country and plains, there will be
found beds of drift sand and gravel with probably lignite
and pyrites, containing abundance of water.

Block 10’s big concentrating plant is, after very
great delays, got in order, and was satisfactorily tested
last week.
* * * *
Junction is disposing of a little of its second-
grade sulphides, in crude form, to Block 14 ; its first-grade
ore is still being shipped. The mine is now connected
with the railway line to Port Pirie and Port Adelaide ;
and Junction North is now having a branch put in.
Junction’s exports of ore still average over 1000 tons per
week. No change in the look of the stopes. The second-
grade sulphide contract with Block 14 is for 10,000 tons.
Block 14 has been looking better lately, especi-
ally at the 300 ft. level. Here the ore is more compact
than the bulk of what has been developed hitherto. Still
the mine could not conveniently keep its mill and works
running on its own ore ; its consumption of crude ore
now exceeds 2000 tons a week, independent of the small
quantity of carbonates sent to the furnaces at Pt. Adelaide
and used for blending. Sulphide concentrates are in such
active demand for shipment to Europe that for some
classes the co. finds it more profitable to sell straight out
to shippers than to roast and smelt on its own account.
Koch’s Pioneer, Bendigo, 250 loads and plates,
2490 z. 2dwt. ; 9d. div. (£1875), the second since the new
year. Principally breaking a 16ft. body of spurry country
at 1450 ft., that looks good for more divs.
Hustler’s Reef No. I—the1 —the Sunday tipster’s sweet-
pea, that slumped ss. in one pop—had a lean time last
half, calling up £945 13s. to meet ex.’s. Milled 988 tons
for 2050 z. lOdwt. Co. driving a level north at 1000 ft. to
intersect the Comet run of spurs, and, if picked up,
holders stand a chance of getting back the money they
dropped when advised to buy in at top rates, because the
“ stock was going to £l.” Has a long road to go yet ere
reaching 20s.
Catherine Reef just more than paid its way on
4dwt. stone the last six months. Milling 4230 tons for
10240 z. Bdwt. From the appearances, the mine should see
the div. list again this term.

Sir Henry Loch, Ballarat, 561 tons for 3020 z.
19dwt; previous fortnight, 362 tons, 1920 z. 19dwt. In-
crease due to additional stamping power. Another div.
in sight.

New Chum Railway, Bendigo’s deep level dandy,
thumped out £4611 ss. divs. last half, and on Saturday
has another one. Stone milled, 1885 loads for 25090 z.
7rlwt. ; average, nearly loz. 7dwt.—not to be sneezed at
from a ‘2B7Bft. reef. So far, the north level has sent out
the best stone from a 28in. to 4ft. body. New Chun
promises even a better record this term.

At Beenak (Vic.) several alleged payabX

Reefer Lansell expects to strike a “bonanza ” in
his 180 mine. Now down 3350 feet, and so hot that the
men reckon they are within hailing distance of Sheol.
At 3140 ft. a thermal spring was cut, and, as a similar
strike in the deep ground of the Consolidated, Virginia
(Nevada, U.S.) preceded mining £27,000,000 worth of gold
and silver, Bendigonia,ns hope that Lansell may have a
like level. Anyway, his pluck deserves it.
* * * *
Harris’s Reward (Tas.) is .£llOO in debt. To
put the co. on its legs two 6d. calls are necessary. But
the mine on its crushings promises to be a better call-
bleeder than div.-paver. Whether the co. is to go on or
burst will be decided next week.

The prospectus of the Newcastle and Stockton
Gold-mining Co. (no liability) appears in this issue. The
co s ground consists of 50 acres on the famous Turon field,
near Wattle Flat (N.S.W.). The capital is £30,000 in
3U,000 £l shares, and the former holders of the property
show their confidence in the undertaking by accepting
payment wholly in shares. With so small a capital to pay
dividends on even a very moderate mine should have a
show. Pleitner, M.E., who gives a good report of the
venture, used to be Mayor of Baker’s Creek in its best
days. The syndicate (mostly experienced working miners)
which formerly held the ground is taking up, in its indi-
vidual capacity, a number of contributing shares in addi-
tion to those allotted in payment for the property.
Dr. Fiaschi, the Italian medico so well-
known in Sydney, is leaving for six months’ nigger-
shooting in Abyssinia—in other words, the clever
doctor who, as an all-round practitioner, has few
rivals in Australia, is going out, from patriotic
motives, as a volunteer in Baldissera’s dishevelled
army. Pity that a man embodying so vast and
rare a store of medical instinct and experience
should be set up as an Aunt Sally for casual black-
fellow’s bullets.
Mr. Hugh Dixson tells The Bulletin that
the Victoria Regia plant itself has not cost him
£5 to raise, apart from his own personal labor; and
for the same amount of the latter he could have
raised twenty specimens. Indeed, he did raise
two, one of which he sent to N.Q. for the purpose
of establishing it in Australia, but the plant, un-
fortunately, did not carry. House and all did not
cost £2OO, and the building was erected largely
with the object of forming as complete a collection
as possible of Australian and New Guinea epiphy-
tal orchids. Strangely enough, such a collection
does not at present exist in any of the Australias.
Apropos of a press statement that Mr.
Hugh Watt (once Home Rule M.P. for Camlachie,
Scotland, who ratted and as a Unionist only
polled 179 votes in ’92) was abusing him in Lon-
don, Premier Kingston has written to the S.A.
papers saying that Mr. Watt offered, when in
Australia, to “make it right” with him (King-
ston) with an offer of £20,000 stock in Watt’s pro-
posed Northern Territory Co. The Premier goes
on to say that he at once showed Mr. Watt the
door, and now publishes a statement of the occur-
rence which he at once committed to writing, and
brought under the notice of several persons, in-
cluding his colleagues, ex-Govemor Kintore, the
leader of the Opposition and the Agent-General.
Sangster, M.L.A. (Vic.), has succeeded,
after much labor, in getting a very unpromising
board created to inquire into the coffin-ships of
Melbourne. And now strange and awful evidence
is_ pouring in about vessels in the coastal trade
with iron plates worn so thin that they can be
crumpled up by hand, rivets that are mere masses
of rust, angle-irons decayed till they are falling in
pieces with their own weight, patched boilers with
rust-holes in them large enough to admit two
fingers, floating cemeteries that are liable to double
up in a heavy sea and drop their cargoes out
through the bottom, and similar horrors.
Up to now, the trouble has been mostly over
a certain well - known collier averred by
the complainants to be chiefly a mass of
rotted plates held together by paint and
force of habit; but one witness alleged that there
are many even worse vessels on the coast. If his
statements prove reliable, some of these other
vessels should be worth seeing. The Vic. Marine
Board, which licenses the alleged floating grave-
yards to go to sea, is mainly a body of persons
interested in the shipping trade. “Noman is a
competent judge in his own cause.”
Poor old Parkes sold oft' his library and
art curiosities the other day, reserving only a few
precious things. The old man was in low water
eight or nine years ago, and his books were pri-
vately sold then ; but afterwards he had a bit of
financial luck, and bought them back again. It is
a queer commentary on men, and books, and
Parkes, that in last week’s sale scores of volumes
came to the hammer uncut and unread, which had
been so sold and bought back, and were once more
sold—still uncut and unread. On the whole,
Parkes got good value for the collection—as
second-hand books go. He hadn’t bought with
much discrimination as to price, and had
generally paid top figures lots of volumes,
for which he gave 12s. and 16s. new, went
for Is. Od. and 2s. 6d. On the other hand, a
few books that he had acquired for half-guineas
fetched guineas —not very many. “ Henry
Parkes ” on the fly-leaf wasn’t worth anything
extra—it was too common. Taking the books all
round, the collection was evidently that of a man
with a taste for reading, who loved books for their
own sake, but was neither student nor collector.
When Parkes had the cash, he plainly enjoyed
spending it lavishly on nicely-bound volumes of
some literary or artistic interest; but he doesn’t
seem to have worried them much. Probably they
gave him a sense of pleasant companionship as he
gazed round the walls, and struck him as a suitable
setting for the Grand Old Make-Believe of Aus-
tralia.

The most important point for the consideration
of all persons who desire to possess photographs
of those nearest and dearest to them is with regard
to permanence rather than price. No photograph
that will turn yellow, break out in spots, or vanish
into nothingness within a few weeks can have its
value expressed in figures. When delivered, it
may shine like the enamelled mystery on a soap-
box, but the seeds of disease are there, and must
come to the surface. This may be regarded as
one of the certainties of cheap photography at uer

SOCIETY
CAMEO
In Mongrelia. On Sunday afternoon a
white woman came on to the pub. verandah with
three piccaninnies, evidently her own. One, half
Chinky, angle-eyed and creamy ; one, half nig.,
splay-footed and snuff-and-butter; one, white en-
tire, snub-nosed and freckled. “One touch of
nature makes the whole world kin.” The coming
Bananalander will have an aunt in Pekin, an
uncle in Fiji, and a cousin in Houndsditch.

It would surprise most Australians, and a
good many Britishers, to learn who were the two
exalted personages implicated in a recent memor-
able smuggling case. Though a charge of con-
spiracy to defraud the Customs —a more serious one
than would have held against the actual de-
fendant himself—might have been formulated
against these parties, action was not taken, nor
were their names published in any of the papers.

The humor of the New Australian fiasco is
gorgeous—and pitiful. One of the pilgrims has,
at latest, run short of clothes for his family—
consequently he is compelled to lock up his
eldest daughter by day m the paternal mansion
of wattle-and-dab, and only allow her out when
the dusk of evening kindly conceals the damsel’s
deficiencies in the matter of raiment. . . The
wife of a prominent Paraguayan agitator left both
her hubby and the settlement the other day, and
ran away with a so-called “fancy man.” Deserters
are only allowed back by the voice of the majority;
consequently, when the erring pair applied for
re-admission into the settlement, the matter was
put to the vote. Paraguayan communistic opinion
views these little lapses very leniently, wherefore
Helen and Paris were received back joyfully into
the bosom of the social family—the husband voting
in favor thereof. Surely magnanimity could go
no further.
Rev. Rentoul, recently discoursing before
Melb. Presbyterian Assembly, viciously denounced
“Trilby” as the record of the “adventures of
three drunken artists with a naked wumman,” and
advised everybody in search of light and whole-
some literature to purchase Prof. Harper’s inter-
esting worruk on Deuteronomy! By the way,
readers of “Trilby” have always been of the
opinion that only one of the three artists was
drunk at all, and then only on one occasion.
There’s nothing in it with the rev. fibster when he
gets going on a high-gear.

Gov. Brassey, at the Melb. Oddfellows’
banquet, spoke of “ the powers and possibilities of
well-directed self-help.” Judge Molesworth had
something to say upon the same subject during the
City of Melbourne Bank enquiry. ‘ ‘ Help your-
selves, ” says Brassey. “You have helped your-
selves,” says Molesworth, J., to the overdrafting
City Bank directors.
Melb. Anti-Sweating League has discovered
a woman who earned at the rate of 6s. 9d. for 66
hours’ work, and has been cut by the sweater, so
that her earnings for the same time would be 4s.
“Let ’em sweat,” says the Fat ring in the Leg.
Council.
The “official Catholic” is
becoming a wondrous spectacle of
untraditional grovel. Having
evidently no knowledge of what
is the right thing to be done
in the august presence of a
“prince of the church,” he
falls into the most inglorious
attitudes in the presence of
Cardinal Moran. At a
recent meeting at th 6
Australia Hotel, Sydney,
in connection with the
formation of an Irish rifle
corps, a full display of
the peculiar tactics of
these gentry was given.
The Cardinal stood in
the centre of the room,
attired in a red robe and
skull cap, and as each of
the big “ lay ” guns en-
tered he approached the
princely figure, took the
august hand, and, kneel-
ing on one knee, bent
over the hand as if mak-
ing a minute examina-
tion of the apostolic
finger-nails. In the real
Court ceremonials the big-wigs of
ceremony confer honor in tliei r trained genuflections,
the result of mutual pride in both the groveller and
the grovellee; but the wild, untrained, Brumby-
like attempts at the manners of an ecclesiastical
court by the Australian “ official” Catholic make
ocoders squirm in agony. One notable excep-
tion on this occasion was a well-known maker of
long and dismal speeches (“ It is my sacred and
solemn jooty ”), who entered the room, manfully
sailed up to the Cardinal, shook him warmly by
the hand, and passed on without deflecting one
inch from the perpendicular.

The Australasian, after publishing photos,
of sundry Melbourne city barmaids, is going to the
suburbs for Hebe subjects. The efforts of what
used to be “ high-toned ” journalism to maintain
its circulation are rather pathetic. In about an-
other six months’ time, the Australasian will
have arrived at Kitty, the damsel to whom Bird
J. P., used to offer advice gratis. She was formerly
in the business.

Dear Bulletin, — lie a recent case at
Sydney Central, isn’t it a bit rough that a man
should be charged as a vagrant because he is an
opium-smoker ? Boozers are not lugged out of
pubs, and charged, quoad boozers, with ‘ in-
sufficient lawful.” Official hypocrisy over this
opium business is sickening. If the whole com-
munity used the drug, it wouldn’t kill one person
for fifty that are slaughtered by the compounds
which, with only the feeblest pretence at restric-
tion, are vended all over Sydney as decent alco-
holic Iiquor.—MACASSAR.

Mrs. Mackin, the Sydney lady who fired
six shots at a burglar and then hurled the empty
revolver after his retreating form, is remembered
by many Melbourne friends as a game young
sportswoman. Her father, the original Mark
Foy, had a place down at Mordialloc, where Alice
Foy (now Mrs. M.) used to shoot, swim, ride, row
and fish equal to any two ordinary amazons rolled
into one. There were no flies on Miss Alice. She
came forth, in trousers, and hauled the boat out
to sea when she wanted to go fishing. Lucky
thing for the burglar that the lady of the house
wasn’t armed with an axe. He’d have been be-
headed on the spot.

The people of Nauru, in the Marshall
Islands —according to Dr. Irmer, the German
Captain-General—are mentally and physically the
finest he has met with in the Pacific. “ The mis-
sionaries, however, have never been able to do
anything with them,” and—is this cause and effect?
—“crime is unknown in the island.” But no
doubt, in the long run, the “ gawspel ” will get
there and change all that.

Residents of Manly, Australia’s most charm-
ing watering-place, don’t take kindly to the present
ridiculously low steamboat-fares. What they want

ing ” couples, waste-paper, larrikins, and banana-

Holdar M. : About the reputed “casual-
ness ”of the native inhabitant. The other day,
in Sydney, a “bloke"and his “bit” boldh
preached a matrimonial agency. Arrived at t.. 0
portal of this soul-uniting sanctum, whereon is
invitingly inscribed, “ Enter without knocking ”
young Lochmvar s grit seemed to fail him some-
what. However, confidence being whispered
into his ear by his undaunted charmer, he
ascended the balcony steps, adjusting a gor-
geous neck-tie by way of screwing up his
determination, and vanished, leaving fair Ellen
on the footpath meditatively consuming a
bag of black grapes and nonchalantly swinging on
her heel. The blissful preliminaries arranged, the
bridegroom from Surry Hills re-appeared on the
balcony and emitted a curt, triumphant whistle,
signalising to his choice to accompany him inside.
This she proceeded to do, after stooping uncon-
cernedly to recover a few grapes that had escaped
from a bunch she was at the moment working
upon. Whom the agent hath joined, let no Win-
deyer put asunder.

D.F. : “ Interesting problem for a Demo-
cratic community. By what right do students
from the medical schools ‘ walk the hospitals ? ’ &c.
Could a patient sue a student who felt his pulse or
thumped his or her chest, say, while in an uncon-
scious state, for assault, criminally or civilly ? Are
hospital institutions supported by the rich to pro-
vide a poor ‘corpus vile’ on which their own
future medical attendants may try their prentice
hands ? If the exhibition of patients to pawing
students is within the law, is not the submission
to it a ‘ consideration ’ for any services rendered
by the hospital, and accordingly the word ‘ charity ’
a cruel misnomer ? ”
Dear Bulletin, —Do you know that an
Irish curse, however forcible in timbre, will not
work unless “bare flesh touches the ground”?
Recently I saw a young woman, wife of a Gipps-
land selector, not long from the “ Ould Sod,” cast
a long, black curse on a bailiff put in by a store-
keeper. She rushed out in a frenzy, tore down
her stockings, and, flopping on her knees, sent up
one of the most vivid and picturesque anathemas
it has been my happy lot to listen to. lam fol-
lowing the career of that bailiff with much
interest. —S.S.

The bad times have seriously affected the
clergy of at least one church. Forty per cent, of
the Wesleyan ministers have, during the past year,
received only from <£l2o to <£l6o. The minimum
salary is supposed to be <£22o, and until lately any
deficiency was voted out of the connectional fund ;
but, owing to the heavy drain, this has now been
stopped.

The Salvation Army leaders, terrified
apparently by the rebellion of Ballington Booth,

Dear Bulletin, —
“ Dr. Brigham Brown’s ”
assailants display a
lamentable lack of per-
spicacity in assuming
that a writer of such
comprehensive in te 11 i -
gence would advocate
excessive sexuality as a
manly and wholesome
thing. He uses the word
“ lust,” I take it, in the (literal)
sense which is better exemplified in its
derivative “ lusty ” robustly apprecia-
tive of robust enjoyments; prone to
satisfy normal appetites in the normal
manner which in no way involves the
“ diseased sexual brain-centre ” of
“H. H. Champion,” who, by the
way, writes as if satyriasis—an ex-
tremely rare acute affection—were
quite an ordinary result of chronic
excess, and who, before he talked
about “scientific smatterings,”
should have been aware that, in
the words of the greatest Eng-
lish nerve-specialist, “ One man
x will sustain with little or no in-
jury an amount of sexual in-
dulgence which would infallibly
land another in the lunatic asylum.
Excess for one man is so far from
being excess for another that it is
impossible to lay down any satis-
factory general rule.” — Pagan.

On a day that would an iguana roast,
A Westralian boomer gave up the ghost.
Which flew Heav’nward, bold and hardy.
St. Peter gazed at the ghost, irate.
And sternly said, as he slammed the gate—
“ You can’t come here—you should know tnar
well !
We’ve lost our prejudice against Helly-^
But we draw the line at Coolgardie.

“ There comes a sound of marriage bells.”—-Tennyson
“ Back from the party, hot and tired !
Come here, I want to play with you;
Sit on my knee, you little rogue,
And tell how passed the day with you.
“ The pretty lady that I know
Said you’d a winning way with you !
Shall papa go and ask her, then,
To come and always stay with you ? ”
“ That will be nice ; well have such games !
And when I’m tired she’ll carry me ;
And I can ask her if she’ll wait
Till I grow big, and marry me.
“ And yet I’m not so very sure :
One funny way she’s got with her
Is that she seems to love me more
Whenever you are not with her.”
“ I think you’d better go to bed ;
But, if you really care for her,
Come, Curly-locks, and kneel by me,
And say a pretty prayer for her. ”

Miss Olive de
Hugard, winner of the
recent exhibition in
pianoforte - playing at
Melb. Conservatoriurn of
Music, deserves more
encouragement from the
so-called influential pa-
trons of native talent
than she has received
hitherto. Born at Ben-
digo some 18 years ago,
this pretty young artist
scored her earliest
triumph at the Melb.
Juvenile Exhibition
(1880), which served also
to bring Lalla Miranda
and George Majeroni
into notice. Little Olive
easily captured first award
in the “ under 14 ” piano-
forte competition, and
several subsequent suc-
cesses in juvenile con-
tests at Ballarat, Bendigo
and elsewhere endorsed
the good opinion of her
first judges. A more
weighty testimonial to
her talent came from
Charles Halle, who, in
a private letter to a
friend, recommended the
immediate despatch of
Miss de Hugard to
Europe. Also Gov. Pre-
datoros Robinson, with
his cultivated taste in
music and keen eye for a
charming face, tried to
advance the damsel’s
cause by speaking to
Lady Hopetoun and Pre-
mier Patterson about
her. He might as well
have poured his enthusi-
asm into the ears of two
embalmed Pharaohs.
Miss de Hugard was
still on the right side of 16 when she
won a Melb. scholarship entitling her to a
term of tuition from Herr Pabst, and under the
care of that cold, classical professor she advanced
rapidly. Pabst brought her out in public as
his “ star ” girl-pupil about the same time that
he launched Percy Grainger as a boy pheno-
menon. Percy was taken up by sassiety and sent to
Europe. The gifted Miss Olive got left, and little
more was heard of her, after Pabst’s departure,
until she came along to the Conservatoriurn, the
other week, and won the exhibition aforesaid.
Thus far, the subject of this notice h is not been
a patient plodder at the piano. Herr Pabst,
whilst warmly admiring her genius for the instru-
ment, was apt to complain that his brilliant pupil
showed a wayward spirit and lacked boy Grainger’s
pertinacity. But Miss de Hugard, at 18, seems
very much in earnest. For some time past she
has been a State-school teacher at Mentone
(Melb.) with little time to spare for music;
and now that she has obtained a year’s
leave of absence from the school in order
to attend the Conservatoriurn the damsel intends
to love her piano as a—well, say, brother. Miss
de Hugard’s face mirrors an artistic soul. Her
talent and skill as a pianiste are proved. She
may win renown if she will. The Bulletin hopes
that this fair young daughter of the soil will not
blight her promising career by an early attachment
for any commonplace creature of the opposite sex.
How many bright girls have sacrificed a first-class
future at the altar of Augustus, and permitted a
waxy moustache to brush away an admirable
ambition ?

Some of the banners of the Irish friendly
societies need repainting badly. There was one
large patriotic banner in the Melb. St. Patrick’s
Day procession which bore a victorious emblem
representing portraits of Parnell and Glad-
stone linked together by a scroll, whereon
were painted in large letters the words “ Home
Rule.” A banner like that is about comparable
to a banner inscribed “ Sedan ” in a Parisian pro-
session. For Parnell is dead, Gladstone is retired,
and Home Rule is—well, where is it ?
* * * *
The blessings of free education are highly
prized in Bananaland. The other day subscrip-
tions were solicited for improvements to the
Central schools, Brisbane. Scores and scores of
well-to-do parents contributed nothing, ,or next to
nothing ; but a poor washerwoman shelled out 10s.,
and a Chinaman dumped down a pound like a
—well, “ white man.”

Last week at Quarter Sessions, N.S.W.,
Acting-Judge Rogers sentenced a youth to a year’s
imprisonment under separate treatment, saying he
did not wish him to' mix with criminals. The
prisoner begged the Judge to give him two years.
“ Why,? ” asked his Honor. “ I’ll be half-starved,
your Honor,” was the reply. “ Every second
week for the whole time, I’ll get nothing to eat
but bread and water.” The Judge enquired, and
found the lad was right, but he did not alter the
sentence. The law and the gaol regulations only
gave him the choice between herding the youth
up with old criminals and half-starving him
(starvation in youth is one of the most powerful
factors of insanity), and he chose the latter.
Perhaps he was right; but The Bulletin would
like to know who is responsible for such insanely
brutal regulations—regulations at utter variance
with the commonest facts known to medical
science.

S.M. Herald, once the only Australian
paper with a St. Petersburg correspondent,
appears to have recently retrenched in that
direction.
A Victorian cleric
of the “age of consent”
species says : “No
young woman who re-
spects herself would be
alone with a member
of the opposite sex.”
Only a young woman
who was always occu-
pied with dirty thoughts
about herself and the
opposite sex would act
on such a rule. If a
young woman must
never be alone with a
man because it might
give opportunity for
what the prurient old
maid and the unclean
parson are always thi nk-
mg about, then no bish-
op who respected him-
self would ever be alone
with anybody else’s
money lest he should
steal it, or with a plug
of tobacco lest he might
chew it, or with another
bishop lest it might ’e id
to something too hor-
rible to mention. After
reading some recent re-
velations the thought of
what might happen if
one bishop was left
alone with another
bishop is simply awful.
* *
S.M. Herald item:
“ The deputation of
members of the Wo-
men’s Christian Tem-
perance Union, which
was to have waited on
the Minister for Justice
to-day in regard to rais-
ing the age of consent,
has been postponed on
account of it being im-
possible for several of
those desiring to attend
to be present.” In regard
to which The Bulletin
would respectfully inti-
mate that the public is tired of the age of
consent and of the frowsy-minded females who
are always talking about it. Also, that when
this kind of paragraph is met with for about
the 160th time it creates a sick feeling like
that which arises when one meets a combined
odour of damp foetid umbrella and gin and soiled
clothes in a badly-ventilated cellar.

A doleful article on the future prospects of
the Melb. junior bar appeared in a recent law-
paper. The “ amalgam ”is alleged to be driving
out all except those who have long purses to
draw from. The poor man has little chance under
the new system. It makes articles compulsory,
and <£42o is not an unusual figure for this luxury
—so the law-paper says.

One of Auctioneer Kinsman’s marriages
came to a curious conclusion the other day. It
was a case of four years ago-where the husband, a
youth of 20, was arrested and convicted of abduct-
mg his wife, a maiden of 16—for marrying whom
Kinsman was fined £5O. The husband was re-
leased to come up for judgment when or if called
upon. Deeming discretion the better part of
valour, or repenting his bargain, he cleared out
without again seeing his wife, and has remained
away ever since. Here is a maid, wife, and
divorcee at 20.

Melbourne Argus says of the money-lend-
ing business : “ The simpleton who is refused a
loan is fortunate compared with his brother
simpleton who gets one. The latter victim’s ex-
periences resemble nothing so much as those of an
animal in one of the famous pig-killing factories of
Chicago, which goes in squealing at one end of the
process and emerges in the shape of pork-sausages,
at the other. ” But is this original ? Does a Tory
newspaper ever point a moral with a happy simile
“on its own ” ? And porUsa usages out of a
pawnshop !

Another use for the bicycle. On a part-
Sydney-owned sheep-station in the far North-West
(N.S.W.) the resident partner and manager found
himself travelling alongside back-fences while he
was learning to ride his imported bike. Thushetook
to doing odd boundary-riding jobs on that station,
and then passed onto boundary-riding as a regular
thing. Present intention is to import three or
four machines, including one for the station
manager’s wife, which lady is expected to combine-
pleasure and business. Punctures may be numer-
ous ; but that will be a small matter beside the
cost of imported chaff in that arid region—neces-
sary during part of practically every year for the

the number of both horses and men.

There is evidently nothing in the point
that an alien sat on the jury which convicted four
of the Daily Post defendants ; but several high-
class lawyers think the imprisoned men must get
out on the ground that Judge Rogers was wrong
in ruling that an accused person could either make
a statement or give evidence, but that he could
not do both.

Sydney, March 24, 1896.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
Wallace Brownlow’s benefit matinee, at Sydney
Lyceum, was a S.R.O. proceeding, the general
effect being enhanced by the drapery of flags,
laurel-wreaths and life-belts which adorned the
gallery in honor of the shipping-companies’
theatre-party the same evening. But I felt much
safer with those life-belts hanging round. You
see it was Brownlow’s farewell matinee, and if the
tears of the matinee girl had flooded the play-
house those belts might have saved many lives.
The programme proved a great draw, beginning
with the piping-hot act of “Rosette,” with Mrs.
Courtice Pounds making her Australian debut as
Corisandre. Mrs. C.P. wore three feathers in her
hair, and they made her look far less modern than
Flo. Young does in the same dress.
The draw of the bill was the temptation scene
from “Ivanhoe,” with Mr. Brownlow and Miss
Young as the Templar and Rebecca, and two
minor characters to square the party. The battle-
ments were correctly staged, and Leon Caron’s
orchestral scoring of the difficult music was no
small factor in the success of the item. Miss
Young, in white over a rather coquettish pink
lining and ropes of barbaric ornaments, played
Rebecca in her own dark hair, and made a pic-
turesque ensemble poised on the battlements.
Here and there her conscientious singing of the
very arduous soprano music rather suggested a
tour de force, but those who remembered Miss
Young’s success as Michaela in “Carmen,” with
Annis Montague in the title - rdle, were not
surprised at the ease with which she assumed the
serious grand-opera manner necessary in “Ivan-
hoe.” Mr. Brownlow played the Templar in a
rather tangled black wig, and attacked his music
furiously as befitted a doubly-dyed villain who
woos his love “as the lion woos his tawny mate”
—and generally gave that lawless knight his head,
familiarly speaking. Applause and bouquets fell
at the end of the act, and, after the curtain had
been hauled up three times, Mr. Brownlow made
the customary speech, in which, as he didn’t
equivocally assert that he was “too full for words”
after the manner of beneficiaries, I only objected
to his statement that “ grand-opera doesn’t make
you laugh.” Now, I think it all depends on how
deep the lace-frill is on the short fat tenor’s velvet
knickers and whether his hair has a borrowed
appearance. I have always thought that the
short step from the sublime to the ridiculous was
much shorter than usual when you got to grand-
opera.
Judging by press notices in British newspapers
which reach Australia, Miss Ada Crossley is reap-
ing golden opinions on her “rare sweet con-
tralto,” and warm welcomes are promised her in
advance from every place she has ever visited,
which looks a very encouraging sign. Australians
will be pleased to hear of Miss Crossley’s success
in climbing the artistic tree, and—as she intends
to stick to concert work and abjures opera—with-
out showing her stockings, either. But then the
typical contralto is a lot too fat to be shapely.
The concert on St. Patrick’s night in Sydney
Centennial Hall had Gov. Hampden, the inde-
fatigable, in the front row, and a glittering array
of talent on the stage —a debutante contralto, who
was too nervous to do herself justice, supplying an
artistic touch of green to the programme. The
feature of the audience was a festive youth in the
gallery pelting rolled-up bits of paper at a lady
underneath. A great many people lost a lot of the
national music in their anxiety to see how many
times he hit her on an average.
Gov. Hampden was represented by a broker at
the sale of bridegroom Parkes’s library, the other
day, and saved his pocket considerably thereby.
If anybody connected with Guvmentouse had
turned up to bid, the public would have expected
great munificence—there is a strong feeling that
the Governor always gives top prices. Poor Lady
Duff was often in despair over the figures she was
obliged to pay. “ How much do you give for a
fowl ? ” she once asked a Sydney medico’s wife,
and, when she was told, said, simply, “ How they
do rob us ! ” Yice-royalty may obviate this by
purchasing its chops incog., which brings me back
to my point. His Ex.’s purchases by proxy at the
Parkes sale look as if the Gov. means to become a
painfully accurate authority on Australian ancient
history.
People say that at least one of the Australian
Governors should get a reward for thrift, not only
on account of the strict watch he keeps on his own
expenditure, but also for the absolute genius he
displays in’seeing that the bleeding country is not
overcharged for tacks. The regilding of his par-
ticular residence brought out H.E.’s talent for
knowing to a nicety how far the State is liable for
furniture-polish.
St. Vincent’s Hospital ball is going to be a
dazzling one this year under the eyes of Gov. and
Lady Hampden, Gov. and Lady Brassey, and
other visiting Governors who cannot be definitely
alluded to at present (though Gov. Buxton is
known to be a starter). All the consuls and, of
course, a large naval contingent (St. Vincent’s is
popular with the navy) intend to be present, and
a committee of ladies have the poultry supper in
hand. Now that the School of Industry ball is a
thing of the past, St. Vincent’s is the oldest
charity ball of the lot. Miss F. Doyle and Miss
Armstrong are hon. secs.
Naval men certainly do adorn a ball-room, but
they are far from being the grown-up “ catchee-
catchee ” spoken of in “Pinafore.” Many a
Society mother grieves over her grass-widowed
daughter, occasional wife of a roving loo’tenant
whose infant child calls him “that man” on his
brief visits to his home on shore. And yet, though
the lot of Captain Corcoran’s bride is one of the
most trying fates a flesh-and-blood damsel can be
condemned to, you still find Sassiety twining
garlands in his hair, so to speak, and using all its
wiles to lure him to the altar.
A society marriage on the tapis in Sydney
is a case in point. The bridegroom’s barge of
battle has only three days in port, and into these
three days the hero must cram a wedding and a
honeymoon and sail away again on the third day—
yet the damsel is willing to bolt her “ hour ” in
this hurried fashion, though the misogynistic, un-
sympathetic admiral—who is openly alluded to as
a “ wretch ” by the very best society— comes in for
a good deal of polite objurgation for not giving
the bridal roses at least a week to wither in. But
the grass-widower Rear-Admiral has no sympathy
with Love’s young dream. On dit when he sus-
pects that one of his officers is taken that way be
immediately sets him hard tasks, as if it were
possible to work the complaint out of the system.
I was astonished the other day by the pyramids
of bulky MS. which over-ran The Bulletin
sanctum, and, on enquiring, found that these piles
of literature were the outpourings of a locust
swarm of correspondents desirous of publicly con-
tinuing the polygamy-cwm-polyandry discussion.
There were so many of them that it was made quite
plain that polygamy and polyandry are the sub-
jects nearest and dearest to an enormous number
of my fellow-citizens. But it’s all vanity. No
man or woman ever learns from any other man’s or
woman’s experience of the opposite sex. They
may think they do, but they don’t, and that, I
presume, is why in the office of this scurrilous
paper there seems a strong desire to branch off on
a more practical theme—such, for instance, as
“ Why do young ladies want to teach Chinamen?”
Divorce proceedings are occasionally picturesque
and, sometimes, even humorous. In one fresh
Sydney divorce-case, the respondent’s most brutal
act was averred to Be “trampling on petitioner’s
wedding-dress,” and yet, after jumping on his
wife’s wardrobe with hobnailed boots, he pretended
to drown himself, because “her extravagance was
ruining him.” The alleged drowning-attempt was
very funny. He kissed his little daughter, and,
remarking tragically, “Good-bye for ever!”
rushed down and heaved a huge stone into the
harbor, and then lay low on the grass. Then he
spoilt a fine tragedy and a robust evening-paper
sensation by going home meekly to tea.
There was more picturesqueness about the
divorce of a Sydney solicitor and his wife, in
which the chief alleged-cruelty exhibit was that
he had deliberately set fire to her nightdress while
she was on her knees, engaged in prayer. This is
indeed an up-to-date form of arson. If it gains
ground, it will probably become fashionable for
the fond papa to take out a fire-policy on each of
his married daughters.
Apropos kneeling, there was a notable incident
at the recent Irish sports, during the girls’ dancing-
contest. Father O’Flynn and a long row of his
brethren were in the front row of the ring, and,
anxiously desiring to give those behind them a
chance of seeing the fun, they all dropped on their
knees. The row of kneeling priests looked, for all
the world, like worshippers at the golden calf—the
appearance in the arena of a girl in long yellow
hose giving color to the—but, no, I am afraid that
fiction won’t do. I wanted to round off a neat
allusion to golden calves, but whoever would
seriously credit a girl in yellow stockings at an
emerald green Oirish fete ?
There was an especially enthusiastic audience to
re-safiaple ‘‘ In Town ” at Sydney Lyceum on
Monday evening, and to revive memories of the
frivolous, long-vanished Gee-Gees who were dis-
tanced vocally, in some instances, by the new
cast. May Pollard looked nice enough to eat in
Blanche Massey’s old part, and her singing in the
“Golden Mean” duet gave that up-to-date
melody a chance of being heard at last. - But I
hardly think the shapely Miss Pollard should
adopt the Blanche Massey bundlesomeness of
dressing—a general effect of having twined a
window-curtain round about her. That sort
of thing is only meant for human bean-
poles. Miss Jessie Gaston (Mrs. Pounds)
made a more stagey Frenchwoman of Marie
than pretty Grace Palotta but where did
she get'that hat, like an underdone damper
trimmed'with ribbons? Miss Hetty Muret had a
hard rowTfco hoe appearing in the dashing widow
Hobson’s part of Maud Montressor; but she
scored below the belt in the Romeo costume, at
any r;tte,artd she also cut Miss Hobson’s cerulean
remarks about her husband having returned and
substituted the irreproachable sick mother pro-
vided by the author, in her orders re the “ fair
gentleman.”
Flo. Young was the Lord Clanside, with a
straw hat hanging over her ear and the usual
roley-poley look about the pants which is the
familiar aspect of the actress in boy’s clothes. I
don’t know if it’s done on purpose, but the female
“boy’s” continuations always seem to be stuffed
as full as German-sausage skins. It was a good
thing for Miss Young (who has a fine presence in
skirts, but that is the very reason why she can’t
wear a swallow-tail) that Lauri was Captain
Coddie. Lauri’s plump figure isn t so wiHo y
that of his predecessor in the part, and he did not
present the apple-pie appearance combined with
the hollow back which Ilradfield brought to bear on
the situation, thereby making IIoLI y Brown-
clumsy cart-horse by comparison. i ,
low hid his fatal beauty under an el derl y make- p
as the Duke, and Mr. Bathurst (who made so great
a success of his part in the Miss Deci
ing-scene) made the most of his inches in a telling
sketch of the gigantic porter. It was one of the
best things that histrionic infant has yet attempted
“In Town” was well staged and handsomely
dressed, and the chorus did its little best to re-
call the Gee-Gees by daubing on the mortar and
red ochre in the conscientious Gaiety way tnat
doth make chromos of ’em all.
Writes my Melb. correspondent :
“Gov. Brassey has aides enough and to spare,
nevertheless in his case the blessing promised by
the Scriptural sage to the owner of a quivertul
palpably hangs fire. After all, ‘ spare-the-rod-
and-spoil-the-child ’ Solomon was not infallible,
and Shakespeare’s ‘ wisdom ’ is far more up to
date. ‘ Let me have men about me that are tat,
says the latter’s Julius Caesar, a sentiment appa-
rently not understanded of his Victorian Excel-
lency, three of whose attaches are as lean and
hungry-looking as the possession of high, bony
noses, semi - transparent flap-ears, and narrow
shoulders can make them. Of course, birds, in
their little nests don’t always agree, and here, tis
commonly reported, Shakespeare to the contrary,
that most of the friction arises from the pecking
and sparring of the only fat fledgling m the
clutch.
“History repeats itself. Once before a Vic.
Governor’s wife braved old Ocean all on account
of a susceptible cub, suspected of a weakness for a
fair subject of his vice-regal Drother-in-law s
roughly speaking, old enough to be his grand-
mother. In the present instance, matters have
not reached the acute stage, but in the ‘ inner
circle ’ there are whispers of parental rebukes and
curtain-lectures in high life, provoked by the
suspected penchant of a mild matrimonial vassal
for the mature charms of a local society leader.
“The latest society ‘Dreadful’ is the Trilby
picnic, located by bush or beach, as convenient,
the one thing needful being water in the vicinity.
At a certain stage of the revelry the hostess
usually announces to her guests, with the impres-
sive air of one breaking bad news, that she’s most
awfully sorry, but there’s a creek to cross, and the
only plan is to take off shoes and wade.
In view of the prevalence of these entertain-
ments, there would seem to be an opening in
Melbourne for a thoroughly competent pedicure.
The effects of pointed toes and high heels cannot
be undone in a day, and few modern maidens feel
as confident in their nethermost charms as that
16th century French damsel of high degree who
wagered that his frisky highness, Henri Quart,
would kiss her bare foot before sunset. Then she
tripped forth en paysdnnc, a milk-pail balanced
on her head, and her-- —
“ One of the graceful, dressy daughters of a
well-known Melb. medico has opened a millinery
establishm ;nt in Collins-street, in conjunction
with two friends, one of them the daughter of a
hoary patriarch who, from time immemorial
until lately, derived an annual income of £3OOO or
more from pastoral properties. The pretty pro-
prietress herself, as a connection of the Ercildoune
Wilsons, can claim kinship, more or less remote,
with the Countess of Huntingdon, Lady Sara
Wilson, Mr. Agnew Ralston, the latter’s cousin,
Lady Hopetoun, and so on, ad infinitum.
“ The unco yuid Anglican parson who fell foul of
dancing in a recent pulpit frenzy, is, as his
parishioners know to their sorrow, a typical
specimen of the lachrymose snuffiebuster. As
shepherd of a Melb. suburban fold, he went out of
his way to collide oratorically with the corns of
the congregation. All remonstrances met with
the same aggravating response, ‘ My friend ! your
frame of mind is far from Christian ; until you
have humbled your spirit with prayer, not forget-
ting strong crying and tears, I must refuse to
confer with you ! ’
“ The divine Sarah has confidentially informed
half-a-hundred interviewers that a favorite trick
of hers is to wear, when acting, the most magnifi-
cent clothes and jewels, and to do her best to rise
superior to them. And in this she generally suc-
ceeds. The gorgeous appearance on her entry
often ‘ hits her audience between the eyes, and
makes it gasp,’ but the superb millinery is soon
forgotten in the genius of the acting. In ‘ Fe-
dora, ’ Mrs. Brough evidently emulates the great
Frenchwoman—for more splendid gowns than the
Russian princess wears have seldom been seen
here. But does she rise superior to them ? Hardly,
I think. Even when, torn between love and re-
venge, she wrests the secret of Vladimir’s murder
from Ipanoff, one is almost too conscious of the
fact that she is looking extremely smart in ame-
thyst wall-paper brocade tres decollete, set off with
touches of Black. In Act I. a voluminous! y-
trained cream brocade skirt, with bodice of sable,
gives her quite the appearance of the Russian
princess of fiction—the only real, live Russian
princess I ever saw, by the way, wore per-
petual cashmere, prunella boots, and a mus-
tard - colored wig always slightly awry A
‘poem’ in shimmering yellow crepe de" Chine
trimmed slightly with iridescent ‘fish-scale’ em-
broidery is worn in the great third act, and the
unfortunate princess dies in black crepe flashing at
hem and wrists with gold and bronze ‘fish-
scales. Through the whole play Mrs. B. wears
her beautiful hair parted in the centre, much irisi
and drawn slightly over the ears, and in the two
first acts she sports a fine tiara of diamonds. Her
cloak is of steel-grey silk, brocaded with primroses
and lined with sable, and it has vast sleeves of
black velvet edged with fur. Countess Olga Faber
never looked prettier than she does inthebuttercup-
brocade gown finished with turquoise-blue velvet
and old lace, which she wears in the salon in the
second act. In the third act she accepts “Jon"
de Sealingwax,” as he calls himself, in brown
crepon striped with blue with bodice of blue
velvet, and beefeater hat of brown and blue.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The Sydney Cup is, at time of writing, very
likely to be won by either of two horses from Victoria—•
the trusty Wallace or the roguish Music. Given the
latter at the post in good condition and a trying mood, he
would certainly shake the stake. The Music that came
with a rattle after Hova at the end of the Flemington
Stakes, that made a remarkable run, after lagging in the
extreme rear, for the Melbourne Cup, and subsequently
won the Williamstown Cup in greased-lightning style,
was a brilliant horse when so disposed. Music’s weight
in the Randwick event is 31b. less than he carried at Wil-
liamstown, and, if he goes for it, the “ books,” who have
good memories for sensational performances, will save
him for themselves as much as possible.
Wallace’s running into a place seems to be
merely a matter of health and freedom from “ interfer-
ence.” Interference is the dangerous animal which beats
so many first favorites on Australian racecourses, but if
Wallace can get away from him the St. Alban’s colt
should finish first or second—always supposing that the
weather gives the fastest horse a fair chance to do his
best. Wallace was not quite as hard as he might have
been at Flemington the other week, nor did James Gough
start to punish his mount quite soon enough. If the
horse improves 71b. during March, which he is likely to
do, he will be right among the front rank half-a-mile from
home, and then the others can say their prayers. Mean-
while, there is no price about Wallace. 5 to 1, with a
several days’ chance of a “going wrong” against the
backer, is a worse investment than 5 to 2 on the day of
the race.
* * * *
The ring is as chary about laying Wallace for
Sydney Cup as it was about his sire years back. Being
marketable for a very limited amount, his win wouldn’t
put much of a crimp in their bank-notes.

The season’s record up to date shows that none
of the “ fashionable” Victorian jockeys have won oftener
than once in every five tries, or thereabouts. Bob Lewis’s
figures are 165 mounts for 32 wins. Herbert Holmes has
almost as good an average for 105 mounts, and W. H.
Pearson’s average (113 mounts) is fractionally better.
These three appear to have yielded their “followers” a
decent amount of fun for the money, however, inasmuch
as they have each run into a place about as often as they
finished “ nowhere.”
* * * *
Imported Van Cleve, sire of champion trotter
Fritz, stood the season at Hobartville before Mr. Buckland
got him, but he never got a trotter worthy the name, nor
has he sired anything out of the common beyond the
flyers handled by Mr. Buckland from their infancy; from
which it would appear that early instruction is as much a
factor as breeding in the making of champions. Mr.
Buckland has kindergarten tracks at Wonbobbia, and the
handling and instruction of the youngsters commences at
a very early age.

The big Indian event, the next Viceroy’s Cup,
promises to be of unusual interest to Australian horsemen.
Quiver has been bought with the special object of annex-
ing the Cup, and reports are going that Hova’s owners
intend taking him across the pond for the event.

Young Bryan, who took to Maoriland the Syd-
ney trotters Pastime and a fine colt by Era, has ind'e d
had bid luck. Pastime, who showed half-miles in 1.15,
has never won a race ; and the colt, after breaking a bit
and having a miraculous escape from eternal smash, has
now died of colic.

The prime reason why the three-year-old Damien
is sneakingly regarded in Melb. as a good outsider for
Sydney Cup is that he has a racy appearance and is in the
dangerous stable of J. Wilson, jun., owner of Newhaven,
and, till lately, owner of Quiver. Kangulandai, a two-
year-old stable-mate, may pick up a crumb during the
meeting.

The promising Hotchkiss horse, True Blue, is
one of the sort likely to make his mark in the near future.
Having undoubted pace, he may prove in Hooke’s stable
a worthy successor to the retired Jeweller. His nomina-
tion against the cracks for Randwick w.f.a. events indi-
cates a strong belief in him.

Unluckily, unreliable Response, in great fix just
now, is one of the best-treated mares in Doncaster and
Cup, but she has a knack of just missing races, no matter
whether the company is good or bad. She’d make ago of
it with a ’bus-horse up the straight, and then manage
to get beaten somehow.

Stanbury left for England on Saturday per Aus-
tral to fulfil his engagement with the English champion,
Harding. Harding must be a good little ’un, but it is i
physical impossibility for a 9sst. man to extend such a
man as Stanbury— i.e., of course, the Stanbury we used tc
know. Hanlan may be urged as to what a little man can
do, but it must be remembered that even Hanlan weighed
the best part of list, in condition, and at the period of
his victories was the only man in the world who knew how
to utilise the sliding-seat.

The quarrel between the Victorian and N.S.W.
rowing associations, as to whethei a man who is an amateui
under Victorian and a professional under N.S.W. rules
shall be allowed to row in the Victorian representative
boat, is on all-fours with the dispute about equalising the
franchise under which provincial representatives shall be
elected to the Federal Convention.
* * * *
The pigheadedness of the N.S.W. Rowing Asso-
ciation over the miserable Dawson squabble will meet
its just reward if Vic., Q., and Tas. ignore the older
province and race “ on their own ” upon the Yarra.

It is 11 years since Tasmania competed in the
interprovincial-eight event, but it is thought the required
exes, will be forthcoming for representation on the Parra-
matta in May. Tas. has the makings of a stronger crew
than usual.
* * * *
Some trouble may be experienced in satisfac-
torily selecting the N.S.W. four-oar crew. There are a
number of first-class men—enough to form two good
crews, and as the regatta is held locally there’s no reason
why the association shouldn’t be doubly represented.

Melb. bookies complain of the times, and of
being struck so often lately. The reason is that some are
backers one race and layers the next. The penciller of
to-day isn’t a man of risks. If a backer gets a leg-in in a
paltry £2O double the bookie haunts him until he lays
some of it back.
* * * *
The conservative notion re the press has been
partially abandoned by the V.R.C., who now supply more
information concerning inquiries than heretofore. Yet
Melb. dailies don’t give the names of bookie witnesses,
“ well-known backers,” or anybody. So that if reporters
were admitted to the star chamber they probably wouldn’t
say more than they do under the new order. The public
only want to know if the investigations are conducted
squarely.

C. J. Ham, the Vic. M.L.C. who has

Australian Federation, is the genius who, not so
long ago, denounced a Democratic measure sent

Whereupon, even the ranks of Fatmanity fcould

them back to Perth. Then Donnelly tracked to
Ballarat (arriving just after the Eureka episode),
where he was one of the first—if not the first-to
find gold under the basaltic rock.

The recent death at Melb. of Frederick
Leopold Smythe, the clumsy, good-natured Irish
barrister, removed the last of the group of Yic-
torian counsel of the Aspinall, Ireland, and
Sewell era. In his student days Smythe was a
close and intimate friend of Daniel O’Connell. It
was Smythe who once blundered into an apology
to Chief-Justice Stawell, Redmond Barry and tne
elder Williams sitting in Banco for having
addressed their honors as “gentlemen.” “I made
a mistake, your anners,” he innocently said.
“Father” Chiniquy, it appears, is still
neglecting his obvious duty of making the grass
grow green, as he writes a letter to an Australian
friend (a parson, of course) under date of January
last. The firebrand says :
You are living in peace in your beautiful and rich land
of Australia for which your heroic ancestors shed their
blood and fought the battle of liberty.
Such cant comes well from Chiniquy, who, on the
first night of the Hobart riots which had been
caused by his lectures, left the committee-room by
a back way and disguised in a woman’s petticoat.
In the early days of Botany Bay clergymen
were often magistrates. The sainted Samuel
Marsden, in his character as magistrate, once
ordered a servant to be flogged. The servant took
to the bush afterwards, and, being captured and
charged with a capital offence, was hanged. Mr.
Marsden attended him as spiritual adviser on the
scaffold. Speaking of these magisterial clergy-
men, Dr Lang once said : “In other countries
the clergy have been accused of taking the fleece ;
but N.S. Wales is the only country I ever heard
of in which they are openly authorised, under a
Royal Commission, to take the hide also, or to flay
the flock alive.”
Leslie Stephen, lately appointed trustee of
London National Portrait Gallery, is a member of
the Australian Stephen family, and was cousin of

the ear of publishers generally, but very little
Moore, Photo.

good came of it. John Hay, visiting England,
obtained for Harold an appointment as Sydney cor-
respondent to a London daily, which made Harold
upbraid Leslie for inefficient kinship ; but Leslie
continued to write kindly, appreciative, and en-
couraging letters, always requesting more and
more work to be sent to him. An Australian pub-
lisher is turning over Harold’s booklets with a
view to early republication.
Mr. E. Pariss Nesbit, Q.C., of Adelaide,
writes :
Dear Bulletin, —A few words in reply to your state-
ment that I am “ running politically amuck ” in Adelaide.
A man who runs amuck stabs at everybody he can reach.
I have done no such thing. I was compelled in self-
defence to tell the public the facts with regard to my
retirement from the late firm of Gordon, Nesbit and
Bright. When my dear friend, J. H. Gordon, stood for
the Leg. Council seven years ago he voluntarily told me
that when I wished to come forward in politics he would
stand back. For nearly seven years I effaced myself poli-
tically to give him a show. When, a month ago, I asked
him to fulfil his promise he demurred. I thereupon
retired from the firm, and a week afterwards he retired
from the Ministry. lam 43 years old, and for 30 years it
has been the dream of my life to represent my native dis-
trict, Barossa, in Parliament. You quote my advt. in
which I say that though Kingston has done very good
work he is very slow and very stupid and that he has
truckled to the crowing hens who run the Women’s
Christian Temperance Union and the Social Impurity
Society. You add —“ And Kingston had made Nes-
bit a Q.C. in spite of the opposition of at least
one of the Supreme Court Judges.” Nothing of
the sort. My appointment as Queen’s Counsel was
delayed for nearly two years because the Playford
Government would not act on Chief Justice Way’s nomina-
tion of Henry Downer as Q.C., and the Chief, not
unnaturally, declined to nominate me until his prior
nomination had been confirmed. Homburg', the then
Attorney-General, said that I was the only member of the
Bar entitled to the appointment, and he would not con-
sent to the appointment of anyone else. Even Sir John
Downer, the Premier of the next Government, did not
venture to act upon the then somewhat stale nomination
of his brother. But I have it on the word of his Attorney-
General, Mr. Homburg, that, subject to some doubts as
to the power of Australian Governments to appoint
Queen’s Counsel, Sir John Downer’s Government would
have appointed me if the Chief Justice had made the
nomination. Shortly after the Kingston Ministry came
into power, as both all the Judges and the Government
were agreed that I was entitled to the appointment, the
Chief Justice told me that he did not see why my
appointment should be longer delayed because the
Government had refused to appoint Mr. Henry Downer,
especially as Sir John Downer’s Government had not
appointed that gentleman. The C.J. sent for Mr. Henry
Downer, and informed him of his intention to
nominate me. Mr. Downer very generously said
that I was clearly entitled to the appointment,
and he would not play the dog in the manger.
As to my now politically opposing Kingston. There is no
man in South Australia to whom politically he owes more
than he does to me. While disagreeing with much of his
policy, especially with regard to the Malcolm land cases,
I have recognised his great force of character and his
general good intentions. The present Coalition Ministry
was formed at my suggestion. I gave Kingston fair warn-
ing a month ago. I said, “ I am with you on the whole.
I shall support you in the forthcoming elections. But if
you truckle to the Social Impurity Society I shall change
sides.” The very next week he licked their boots. I like
a man who is either a saint or a sinner. Kingston is a
sinner at night and a saint in the morning.
If The Bulletin wanted an excuse for printing
this somewhat discursive letter it would plead the
two last delightful sentences. But, all the same, it
begs to differ from Mr. Nesbit. It is very human
to be a sinner at night and a saint in the morn-
ing. The over-night sinner who wants also to
sin in the morning is a hog.
AN.S.W. minor Judge, who some years
ago joined the great majority, was noted for his
absent-mindedness and sleepiness on the bench.
Once, after listening to a case for three days, he
staggered the litigants by remarking : “ I really
don’t understand what this case is all about, so I
must give a verdict for defendant.” And he did.
On another occasion, when trying a case without
a jury, he patiently waited till counsel had finished
their addresses; then, turning to the jury-box,
which was filled with attorneys’ clerks waiting for
their cases to be called on, he began, “ Gentlemen
of the jury, this is a case ” Here there was a
burst of laughter, and it was explained that there
was no jury. “ Verdict for plaintiff,” said he.
But the Supreme Court rarely
upset the decisions—he never
was absent - minded enough to
“ give reasons.”
Of Mr. Reuben Fox,
whose photo, in the great char-
acter part of Svengali is pub-
lished herewith, The Bulletin
can say nothing at present
beyond the fact that Mr. George
Musgrove has sent him over
here at the head of the
‘‘ Firm’s ” company from
America. G. M. ’s good opinion
is an almost certain guarantee
of an Australian success for
the new leading man, and his
photo., which suggests General
Booth in a fine hallelujah
frenzy, tempts one to anticipate
a real thrill from Mr. Fox.
The photo, by the Falk
Studios on page 1 1 of this issue
represents the winsome Mrs.
Harry Marshall, joint lessee of
Her Majesty’s (Sydney). The
Bulletin published Mrs. Mar-
shall’s alleged portrait in a
recent issue, but an unfortu-
nate accident befell the plate
whereby the pretty lady lost a
portion of her nose. It is with
a view of atoning for that out-
rage that the present picture is
printed.
Sydney D.T.’s London
correspondent compares W. P.
Reeves, M.L. Agent-General,
with his predecessor, Westby
Perceval—to W.P.R.’s disad-
vantage. The truth is that
though Perceval is an able
young man, Reeves is a good
bit above him. Perceval and
Reeves were school-mates; they
entered M.L. Parliament at
the same time; and Reeved
at once became a recognised
force, while Perceval was
little more than his hench-
man. Three years afterwards Reeves was strong
enough to secure Perceval’s appointment as
Agent-General, on the ground that the post
wanted a young, up-to-date man. Reeves’ imme-
diate ambition then was a Ministerial career, but
all his friends knew that his ultimate aim was the
Agency, and that Perceval’s appointment was of
the warming-pan variety.
Melb. : “A word for ex-Speaker Bent.
After all, his career is one of the pet models of the
Y.M.C.A. Lectures to Young Men. Look at the
struggling market-gardener, getting up at 2 a.m.,
and hieing to the city with Moorabbin cabbages.
Then, by sheer industry, he becomes rate-collector.
Seventh Heaven Higinbotham was a great
prophet, but no local member ; and Bent, ousting
him, showed what looking after your constituents
meant, in piers, culverts, marble dung-coffers, or
whatever might be required in a succulent con-
stituency. Minister of Railways—Speaker.
The ex-Speaker was for some time the
occupant of, perhaps, the most desirable
estate in or around Melb.—that of Landcox,
Brighton. It is a remarkable-looking place,
quite a magnificent bit of artificial forest.
Squatter M‘Millan, who laid it out 20 years ago,
spared no money in an endeavor to outshine Joe
Clarke’s Toorak estate. Both of them had first-
class London artists to do the frescoes, which are
probably unequalled south of the line. However,
‘ The great ones of the earth build desolate places
for themselves.’ Both millionaires found their
palaces of art intolerable, under painful circum-
stances, in quite different ways. ”

After All.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The brooding- ghosts of Australian night have gone
from the bush and town ;
My spirit revives in the morning breeze, though it
died when the sun went down ;
The river is high and the stream is strong, and the
grass is green and tall,
And I fain would think that this world of ours is
a good world after all.
The light of passion in dreamy eyes, and a page
of truth well read,
The glorious thrill in a heart grown cold of the
spirit I thought was dead,
A song that goes to a comrade’s heart, and a tear
of pride let fall—•
And my soul is strong ! and the world to me is a
grand world after all !
Let our enemies go by their old dull tracks, and
theirs be the fault or shame
(The man is bitter against the world who has only
himself to blame) ;
Let the darkest side of the past be dark, and only
the good recall;
For I must believe that the world, my dear, is a
♦ kind world after all.
It well may be that I saw too plain, and it may be
I was blind;
But I’ll keep my face to the dawning light, though
the devil may stand behind !
Though the devil may stand behind my back, I’ll
not see his shadow fall,
But read the signs in the morning stars of a good
world after all.
Rest, for your eyes are weary, girl—you have
driven the worst away—
The ghost of the man that I might have been is
gone from my heart to-day ;
We’ll live for life and the best it brings till our
twilight shadows fall;
My heart grows brave, and the world, my girl, is
a good world after all.

same, there’s not to be any local option in niggers.
An Irishman—Bums —and an Irishman —

Six four-wheeled wagons and one cart

stars and stripes gaily waving over all, paraded
Sydney streets the other day. There was no band.
But there should have been.
Last year the number of empty houses in
Melbourne decreased from 14,000 to 10,000, and
the city showed a good increase of population for
the first time since ’9l. Various other things also
suggest that the City of Dreadful Knights is
definitely on the up-grade.
It is all very well to cry out about the 17
N.S.W. Js.P. who are publicans. There were 793
publicans in the province last year, so that only
between 2 and 3 per cent, of the class have been
given opportunities to pervert the law; whereas
over 80 per cent, of the 116 spirit merchants of
N.S.W. are Js.P. —amid public silence.
South Australian Register :—“ In his
attempts to parry the attacks we have made upon
some of his measures the Premier (Kingston) has
been forced to adopt the desperate expedient of
quoting The Bulletin, a journal which noto-
riously subordinates truth to satire and ostenta-
tiously perverts facts to serve the purpose of the
moment.” When this paper made certain un-
pleasant comments recently on the Register, or
rather its weekly satellite, the Observer—the
same comments which Kingston quoted—it showed
exactly where and how that dismal paper had
interfered with the truth and ostentatiously
perverted facts.” The Register is hereby invited
to be equally explicit in return if it has anything
to go upon, instead of merely whirling itself in the
air, so to speak, without any evidence. What
particular “ perverted fact ” is it maundering
about ?
The ultimate reward ol
a Ministry, according to
Vic. Premier Turner:
“Well done, good and faith,
ful servants; make room
for your successors.”
One clause of the Vic.
Companies Bill which the
Council declared it would
die in the last ditch rather
than pass, was that prohi-
biting directors selling their
own property to their own
companies. This good old
swindle is too lucrative to
be sacrificed. The Melb.
director writes in his private
capacity to himself in his
official capacity offering his
own property for sale at not
more than six times its
value. Then in his official
capacity he decides that his
own property (in his pri-
vate capacity) should be
bought by the co. and he
officially pays the co’s
money for it to himself,
and reports to the co. that
he has successfully com-
pleted the purchase of his
own property from himself
at his own valuation, and
congratulates the co. on
the excellent bargain he
has made with himself on
its behalf. Sometimes a very
scrupulous director has
angry interviews with him-
self over the matter, and
beats down the price a
little, and only completes
the purchase on his own
solemn assurance to himself
that the bargain is a good
one —but generally the nego-
tiation goes off quietly. The
proposal that this touchin':
swindle should be abolished
simply flabbergasted the 48
Rich Landlords, who all
have property to get rid of.
N.S.W. Public-school teachers, in the
upper flight only, were, subsequently to ’94,
allowed <£loo a year for house-rent. Some time
after, when rents had fallen heavily, the authori-
ties reduced this allowance by 15 per cent., making
it ASS. This the teachers considered just, and they
murmured not. But the other day they got
notice from the Public Service Board that the
AB5 rent-allowance will, in future, be subject to
the 4 per cent, superannuation deduction—which
is also just, but the teachers don’t see it this time.
Charles L. Garland, who declines to stand
for Cowra (N.S.W.), was looked upon by Parkes,
Garrett, and other destiny-makers seven or eight
years ago as assured for a portfolio. But the teeth
of the Single-tax entered his flesh, and he day by
day developed such political contradictions that
his sponsors were glad when he cleared out.
There is likely to be frietion between some
Melb. suburban benches and the clerks of courts.
Without exception these officials denounced
bitterly the honorary-justice system when called
as witnesses before the Lormer Board. By the
way, in wiping out his brother J’sP. Lormer has
wiped out himself by reason of his record in
adjudicating as a rabid cold-tea man on licensing
cases.
Police magistrate Keogh, giving evidence
before the Lormer enquiry board, stated that
bench - packing in Victoria doesn’t obtain to
any great extent in the country districts. It
isn’t bench-packing that town prosecutors of
country defendants complain about. The in-
variableness of local sympathy with the local man
is what disgusts them, no matter how limited the
number of beaks sitting on the case.
How the good old boom days have
vanished ! A railway is proposed from Tamworth
to Manilla (N.S.W.) ; most of the land required
is being given gratis and a fund is being subscribed
locally to buy the remainder. And only five years
ago the Government would have bought the re-
quired land at three times its value, after fighting
a dozen expensive law-suits, and indignation
meetings would have been held because the locai
owners didn’t get six times the value instead of
only three times. By-and-by the time will arrive
when the district that wants a railway must not
only give the land gratis but put up half the cost
of construction as well, and will be expected to
feel thankful that it gets its line even then.
The Reid (N.S.W.) Government proposes
next session to introduce a law-reform bill, a bill
for the exclusion of colored races from N.S.W.,
and a scheme whereby, in case of a deadlock
between the two Houses, the matter at issue shall
be settled by a referendum. Also, light railways
are to be started and an elaborate system of water
conservation set going. As nothing is said about
levying any new taxation to provide a public
works fund to pay for the light railways and the
water-conservation, it is presumed that another
borrowed money orgy is to be started, and the
unnatural temporary swelling or financial car-
buncle that ensues will be called, as usual, “ a
he dhy development of the resources of the pro-
vim: or some such flap-doodle.
That mildly-republican platitudinarian,
“Gundagai ” Purves, has set the Jingoes howling
in Melbourne by hinting in a Federation yabber
that Australia will surely cast off the Imperial
connection in a million years or so. The Argus
feels hurt, and philosophises through the medium
of the usual useful “ Constant Reader ” :
All this reminds me of honest old Dr. Johnson, who,
being at the house of an eminent theoretical republican
lady, asked her why, if she was such a republican, she
didn’t ask the footman to sit down to table with her.
Which shows that “ honest old Dr. Johnson ” was
an ass at intervals, but quite an intellectual and
brilliant ass compared with the blithering “neddy ”

who imagines a great man to be always great, and
discovers wit and inspiration in him when he only
belches. The terrible evil of a great man’s weak-
ness is in the fact that fools make a gospel of it for
all time.
Premier Reid says it is better to
local industries by bonuses than.by tan *>> ’; ~ d
“ the bonuses would come out of th I • ■ V 1
therefore the whole community would pay to
them.” Yet Reid’s enduring objection to Brotec
tive tariffs is that, as he alleges, they make the
whole community pay ” for supporting s°m e o (1 y
private industry) If G. H. Reid believes in his
glorious Freetrade, why does he want to begm
feebly apologising for any variety of Protection, by
bonuses cr otherwise ?
A QUART OF MOSQUITOES.
"Talk about muskeeters, you’ve just got to swing your pint-pot round and I’m darned if you
don’t catch a quart."
“ As the meek beasts in the garden came
flocking for Adam to name them, men for a title
to-day crawl to the feet of a king.”—Col. John
Hay.
In the little Bill on married women’s pro-
perty, which Postmaster-Gen. Duffy induced Vic.
Assembly to pass last month without discussion on
his assurance that there was “nothing in it,” it
turns out that there is a provision trenching
seriously on married women’s rights under “re-
straints on anticipation.” These have hitherto
been held sacred, but now a Judge can make an
order for the payment of lawyers’ costs out of
such property. No wonder the lawyers of the
House nodded approval when Duffy was bluffing
the rest. Was the “Unlearned Parliament,”
somewhere in the backblocks of English history,
so very unwise when it altogether disqualified
lawyers as members ?
Can a Prime Minister dismiss a colleague
who won’t resign ? Of course, it is the Governor
who does the formal and visible sacking, but can
he do it constitutionally ? Can a Governor dismiss
a Prime Minister, who doesn’t voluntarily resign ?
Again, when a Premier resigns and the whole Cabi-
net goes, willy nilly, and “ constitoosh’nly ” has
the Excellency to send only for the man recom-
mended by the resigning adviser? When then-
Premier Griffith (Q.) wanted “Mines” Hodgkinson
to resign some years ago, Hodgkinson “saw him
bio wed first.” When MTlwraith enacted the
“ Kitts’s Boots ” episode in the same province he
resigned (tailing his colleagues after him), and
refused to advise the Governor about anything, and
his Ex. caved in. Some lawyers hold that Eorrest
could not constitutionally “ sack ” Venn, but
should have resigned holus bolus and formed a new
Cabinet.
Premier Reid, at Hillgrove, in a tone of
enthusiasm : ‘ ‘ Despite the fact that large cargoes
of Californian wheat and flour had arrived, prices
were higher to-day in N.S. Wales than for many
years past.” Reid is a Freetrader because, as he
has said in Sydney over and over again, Freetrade
makes food cheap. And the same Reid proudly
boasts to the farmers of New England that Free-
trade hasn’t made food cheap—that it is dearer
than it ever was under Protection. Reid objur-
gated Protection through three years of dreadful
eloquence because (he alleged) it made food dear—
and now he is glad all over because Protection has
been done away with and food is dearer still.
Wdl the wobblesome Premier please define him-
self ? Does he claim that Freetrade has sent up
i.ood prices ? If so, is he pleased because food has
gone up ? If so, does he still claim that Freetrade
sends prices down ? Also, does he object to Pro-
tection on the ground (as previously alleged) that
it meant dear food or (as now alleged) that it
meant cheaper food than Freetrade has supnlied
up to date ?
Queensland telegram: “Thursday Island.—
The Government steamer Albatross arrived from
the south to-day, with lepers ” The time is
com in o - up North when they will simply put the
unclean in the manifest, along with the other
cargo and the Government Statistician will men-
tion him among the exports. Even now, they
take him quite as a matter of course. No one is
worried, or surprised, or much interested ; it is
merely mentioned that a vessel dropped in casually
at a wayside port “ with lepers.
In their retrenching operations, the N.S.
Wales Public Service commissioners are making
no distinction of persons that is visible to the
naked eye. The fact that a man who has been
getting paid for doing nothing is a member’s
brother doesn’t save him from official extinction.
The other day a N.Q. miner fell down a
70-foot shaft into six feet of water, with the only
result that he was immediately sobered up and
bawled vigorously for a rope and assistance. “No
harm done ? ” cheerfully chipped in a chum as
they hauled the warrior to the surface. “No
harm ! ” ejaculated the rescued one indignantly ;
“ why—d it, man — I’m sober / It’s spoilt my
drunk ! ”
The ennobbled Besant is grateful for
the royal favor, and in his latest novel, “ The
Master Craftsman,” now running in the Age,
handles the House of Lords with touching rever-
ence. His “radical” hero would not tumble
down the House of the anointed Lord.s, but would
strengthen it and increase its powers, andthrough-
out there is manifested a deep veneration for “ our
old nobility ” and all aristocratic institutions.
Drought has some strange effects. Cattle
are driven to eat anything, and maybe seen brow-
sing upon paper, sticks, and every variety of
rubbish. A cow will make short work of any clothes
hung up to dry in an accessible place. A well-
known Western man tells how he saw a horse eat-
ing something by a fence, and, on coming up,
discovered the body of a sheep half finished. It
is surmised the horse began by eating the burrs
on the sheep’s wool, and from that proceeded to
eat flesh and all.
An American scribe in the Fortnightly
throws a flood of light on Uncle Sam’s zeal in the
cause of Venezuela. Some time ago the Vene-
zuelan Govt, made a grant of 15,000,000 acres of
land, rich in rosewood, mahogany, gold, and
minerals, to certain citizens of the U. States. It
turns out now that most of this land is situated ia
the territory claimed by the British. The Vene-
zuelans are chuckling to themselves on the smart-
ness of the manceuvre by which they dragged the
Yankees into the quarrel.
There is a fine irony about Nature out-
back. In Western N.S.W. the tracks 011 which
yesterday men died terrible deaths from thirst are
to-day surging streams of yellow water. Parched
sheep and cattle, which have hardly stopped bleat-
mg pitifully for a drink, gurgle in the agonies of
drowning. Careworn pastoralists, whose runs
were, a few days ago, bare paddocks with empty
tanks lined with dead stock, are now miserably
watching roaring bodies of water wash away ex-
pensive dams and tear down miles of fencing. It
would be humorous were it not so pitiful.

A SENIOR CONSTABLE’S EVIDENCE.
“Police Stud Depot, Dandenong, 24th Feb.,
1896. The Manager, National Wool Company,
Melbourne. Dear Sir, —I have much pleasure
in testifying to the utility of your rabbit-
poison, TOXA. Being in charge of the Police
Stud Depot, I was instructed by Inspector
Beckwith to procure some half-dozen tins of
TOXA. The use of one tin sufficed to show its
usefulness and simplicity. Fortunately, the
pests are not so numerous in the police pad-
pocks, but in the adjoining paddock no fewer
than 900 rabbits were found dead in the
furrows from the use of two tins of TOXA.
Words cannot express its value.—l am, &c.

Patent Street Directories .
AN INGENIOUS CONTRIVANCE.
Those whose business takes them in the vicinity
of Pitt-street must have had their attention drawn
to the number of bright vermilion-colored cases
erected in prominent places indicating the locality
of the business people in that busy thoroughfare.
These cases, known as the “Electric City Street
Directory,” are bmng introduced to Sydney for
the first time by Messrs. Percy and Dearsley, of
f
*
/
H. DEARSLEY.
P.'O. Chambers, Pitt-st., whose photographs are
printed herewith.
This invention commenced its career in N. Z., and
the patentees were not long in discovering that
they had struck an idea which filled a long-felt
want, and this fact was borne out by the strong
support tendered them by the business people
of the various centres, over 11,000 subscribers
being obtained in less than twelve months.
The erection of these directories terminates, to
a very great extent, the trouble and annoyance
visitors and the public generally have had to put
up with in the past when trying to locate any
address required in the vicinity.
Tiie indexes are of the very best workmanship,
having a British plate-glass front, which is set
into rubber to prevent any dust or moisture
getting into the case, and thus the names are kept
free from obliteration and are always distinct,
and, being of a uniform pattern and official color,
at once attract the attention of passers-by and
those who may wish to consult them ; the plates
on which the names are painted are metal, and
can be transferred from one case to another should
a subscriber change his or her address.
The Mayors in all cities and towns where this
* t
G. PERCY.
patent has been introduced, have favored this enter-
prising firm with eloquent testimonials as to the
benefits the public have derived from these
directories.
In addition to the Street Directory, Messrs.
Percy and Dearsley do a large business as adver-
tising contractors ; their branch offices in all parts
of the colonies give them special facilities for ex-
peditious and thorough work.
The Proprietors should have a long period of
success before them ; a success few people will
grudge to the enterprise which may so fairly claim
to have supplied a long-felt want. *

About the only circumstance that prevents
the present Government from sinking into insig-
nificance and oblivion is the large advertisements
one occasionally bumps up against, announcing
that owing to the repeal of the duties Mr. Ragtag
will hold a Freetrade Sale, and give his goods
away almost free of charge (for their full value in
coin of the realm). First comes the Freetrade
sale, then the clearing sale, after which the bill
of sale brings matters to a climax. A notable
exception to the above, is the estab-
lishment known as the Misfit Parlor, where
Mr. Nathan Herman has introduced the latest
novelties. Thousands of people are being
attracted daily to this Mammoth Warehouse,
which has been turned into a retail emporium,
and they usually leave it rejoicing at the genuine-
ness of the magnificent bargains they receive,
only to return next day for more. Mr. Her-
man has a pile of letters (the postmarks on
which are convincing proofs of their genuineness),
advising the arrival of bales of orders to country
customers, and expressive of the satisfactory
manner in which the orders were attended to.
It appears Mr. Herman personally superintends
this branch of the business, and he is exceptionally
particular that all orders shall be faithfully ful-
filled, and nothing shoddy sent to his country
clients. A reference to his advertisement in
another part of this paper will amply repay
the trouble, as the great bargains there enumerated
are certainly unheard of. His £2 bale is a marvel
of the nineteenth century ; his £1 dress bale, and
his wonderful household parcel for £1 are eye-
openers ; and the whole lot, combined with other
bargains too numerous to mention, fill a list which
is verily astounding. The goods are all marked
in plain figures, and Mr. Herman invites anyone
to compare his prices. Intending customers
should therefore call early.*

A Sydney bookie remarked the other day that
the names of people who owed him, and the little
amounts they owed, “would shock a parson.” Betting
on the nod would go under if the tote came along. The
metallician would be practically eradicated—if people
wanted to gamble they’d have to pay cash over the
counter as in buying postage-stamps.

One cannot commend the practice of metropoli-
tan clubs in taking bookies’ evidence at inquiries, but a
remedy doesn’t suggest itself as matters stand. An owner,
asked to prove that he backed his prad when it should
have won, but didn’t, just fetches in Ikey Mo. If Mo has
a “ faked ” book or, worse still, an interest in the horse,
the proceedings are farcical.

Martin, who rides a Humber machine, on
reaching the winning-post shoots bolt-upright to catch
the judge’s eye. He deserved every one of his grand wins
last Saturday, and more than every penny of his total of
£lOO, or just thereabouts, in prize-money. Parsons’s
prize-money last Saturday was £11; Megson’s total is
£26 ; T. P. Johnson stood second with £3B.

Yankee Martin, the present Australian cycling
god, who has the luck to be an iron-jawed man of enor-
mous stamina, showed himself more consistent than most
gods by starting in five events and coming in first four
times, and second once. He beat Parsons twice—in the
Sydney Cup (1 mile) and Invitation International Scratch
(5 miles). The pair, sitting on their machines, shook hands
directly after the finish of the Sydney Cup.

Overheard at Saturday’s cycling : “ Keep right
thar until I say hit her up, and then go like a funny feel-
ing through a church-choir. Keep right along; they
might as well try to snowball in h—l as catch you.”
• « • •
The second and third-class races were funereally
dull after the scintillations of the Martin star. Ex-sculler
Matterson’s win (with 180yds. start) in the 3-miles Open
Handicap (first prize, £2O) made the spectators more tired
than himself. Such is the effect of seeing Martin come all
the way from scratch and down everybody.
♦ * * »
The Tandem Handicap supplied more Martin,
who, with Harris behind, put in the last lap at rocket gait.
Lewis and Porta rode a splendid second, Megson and
Payne a good third. As for the others—they were prac-
tically dead.

Parsons meets Martin this Saturday in their
private races. Parsons does not seem to have too much
show of winning. Taken down by Martin in the five
miles, and beaten in his heat of the one-mile by Payne,
the ten miles is probably his only chance.

At East Melb. bicycle sports, on Saturday, the
erstwhile Austral winner, A. A. Middleton, was in great
form, winning the two-mile handicap from 20 yards in
great style, after making his own pace on the outside of
the bunch all the way. Arthur Turner, who started from
the same mark and persistently hung on to Middleton’s
wobbling wheel, was second. Middleton rides as un-
steadily as ever, but gets over the ground all the same.
* * * *
Parsons’ luck when after the bullion is not
particularly bright just now, but as a record-wrecker he
continues to get there. The other day, at the St. Kilda
ground, he reeled off a lap, 530yds., in 31secs.

On account of the alleged excessive profits
charged by Melb. cycle firms, 40 residents of Richmond

A South Melb. “ rational ” cycliste, who pos-
sesses the unique distinction (among wheelwomen)
of prettiness, turned her accomplishment and her charms
to some account last Saturday, when she took a turn at
pacing one of the competitors in a local road-race. As
was a foregone conclusion, the lucky youth won “ hands
up.” The man who couldn’t travel with a well-developed
pair of feminine calves a few feet in front to lure him on
might as well throw up the game at once.
J. V. Shorland (M.L.) recently set out to break
a 150-mile road record. A feminine Hercules, in bloomers,
suddenly appeared on the scene, and offered to pace him

A cycling Melb. penlady enthusing over a
female costume for the bike : “The divided skirt falls
evenly over a diamond frame, and to all appearances the
rider is in a skirt while the jacket hides from view the
least pleasing portion of a lady’s figure on the saddle.”
Least pleasing portion ” is distinctly good—but
polemical. Tub Bulletin will be pleased to hear dis-
cussion on this subject.

The Brisbane 22-foot crack, Ettie, is likely to
show the Sydney boats her heels over their own course
next Nov. The Ettie, built and owned by an amateur
pure and simple, Mr. “ Billy ” Wain, of the Brisbane Port
Otnce, has beaten all the local and Sydney cracks on
Brisbane waters, and is, perhaps, the fastest boat of her
inches afloat. That an amateur-built boat should outsail
the best productions of the best professional builders is a
thing no fellow can understand.

It is not likely that the appeal of secretary

Irritating and Disfiguring
ERUPTIONS
On the Face, Cured, by
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Remarkable Experience of Miss Dorothy
Maher, Fitzroy, Victoria, whose portrait
we are privileged to give below:
“I take pleasure in testifying to
the great benefit I derived from
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla. I suffered
from eruptions on my face of a very
irritating and vexatious nature.
For a considerable time I experi-
mented with various so-called blood
medicines, but without any allevia-
tion of my trouble. At last, your
famous Sarsaparilla being strongly
recommended to me, I began to use
it, and after taking two bottles it
was most gratifying to see and feel
the effect in allaying the irritation
and reducing the eruptions. When
I had used three bottles the erup-
tions disappeared altogether, with-
out leaving a mark on my face, and
I have never been troubled with
anything of the kind since.”

About the finest Polynesians in Queens-
land are the Gilbert Islanders employed on the
Burnett—-physically handsome men of more than
ordinary intelligence. They receive letters regu-
larly from the Gilberts in parcels of forty or fifty,
and answer the same—some of them in quite a
dashing commercial hand.
Holy Reuben Keirl—a Scripture name
again ! —Melbourne’s leading non-sassiety swindler,
was known in his youth as a shining light of Sun-
day-school and started life as coachman to a
Ballarat Chinese doctor who, when he died, left
all his property (some <£1500) to his faithful jehu.
With this money the godly Keirl began jobbing
on the local ’Change, and with his undoubted
business ability did well for some time. Growing
ambitious, he moved to Melbourne in ’B6, and was
soon much boomed by the local press for his
alleged “saving of a young girl from ruin.”
Keirl’s account was that one evening he noticed
a man and woman entering a coffee-palace “ in a
suspicious manner,” and at once accosted the
couple. The base deceiver shot off down a cor-
ridor, and the “ victim,” on being taken to the
hospital, was found to have been drugged. When
this smellful Y.M.C.A. sensation began to wane,
Keirl bounded once more into public view by
appearing as the most important witness at the
sensational inquest of Laura Swain, the girl
drowned at the Victoria Bridge, Studley Park,
and deposed that, a few weeks prior to the
tragedy, she had confided to him her intention of
committing suicide. In addition to being a wit-
ness in the case, Keirl also took a hand in the
post-mortem conducted by Dr. Neild, and when
the latter functionary stated that, though 2000
cadavers had come under his official notice, he had
never seen so perfectly-formed a woman, Keirl
just put in a word of endorsement, which was
carefully quoted in the reports. At this time
Reuben stood on the same plane in public estima-
tion as the most gilded and holy saints of the then
roaring boom. According to indications, very few
months would pass before Keirl was running Mel-
bourne, and, when he got some capital together
took a hand in publishing the Sporting Wire, a
journal which started off by tipping five winners
out of every possible six, and keeping the average
up, the whole country arose and called him
blessed, while the bookmakers were on the point
of voting him an annuity to go away somewhere.
When the Wire died, allegedly of an attack of
Keirl’s “financing,” he visited Adelaide and
swept over. the Holy City like a simoon. Por a
few months Keirl ran the place, borrowing
money in all directions, became a prominent
social Gimletist, and joined every pious organisa-
tion within a radius of 20 miles. Then, as a
climax, he became engaged to a local heiress, but
before the nuptials could be celebrated certain
information from Melbourne caused the lady’s
parents to consider hard. While they were thus
ruminating Keirl returned to Melbourne, and put
Dr. Deeper, of Trinity College, on to the deadest
of all dead birds in the shape of land companies,
the worthy cleric enthusing to the tune of <£3oo.
Then the awakening came. The alleged co.
was found to be non-existent and Leeper’s
money a minus quantity. It seemed ridiculous
to suspect such a thing, but the guilt was
unmistakeably fixed on Keirl, and that plausible
person got four years’ hard. In ’O3 Keirl was
released from Pentridge, and from that time until
his recent arrest he has been living principally
upon the capital of a wealthy German farmer at
Preston (Vic.), whom he apparently hypnotised
into a complete state of obedience. But the game
could not last for ever ; even the false-pretenc6
racket has its limits, and now Keirl stands sen-
tenced to three years for false pretences, two
years for larceny as a bailee, and a few odd
months for other minor swindles. Keirl is dis-
tinctly unlucky ; had he managed to restrict him-
self to land-companies or banks he might now be a
wealthy and representative citizen living in the
odour of sanctity. His suave address and his
business tact would have carried the man through
any speculating community in the world with a
good balance on the right side had he but kept clear
of the criminal law, for his unblushing effrontery
would have been bound to land him some gigantic
coup sooner or later. Just after his first discharge
from gaol Keirl entered a Coburg tram-car attired
m spats, bell-topper, yellow gloves, and all the
paraphernalia of aggressive respectability. On
taking his seat he noticed Colonel Bull, Governor
of the Pentridge Prison, with four ladies, seated
opposite. Instantly raising his hat, Keirl coolly
remarked “Ah, excuse me, Colonel, I did not
notice you at first.” Bull glared, but made no
response. But Keirl was nothing daunted ; pull-
ing a handkerchief from his pocket, he fanned
himself gently, murmuring “ These hot winds are
very trying, are they not ? ” and sank gracefully
into a restful position in the corner.

T
HIS Company is being formed to acquire five 10-acre Gold-mining Leases held by the Newcastle
_ and Stockton Gold-mining Syndicate. Three blocks of 10 acres each are located on the famous
Surface Hill, and occupy the crown of the hill, overlooking the Turon River near Wattle Flat.
The other two blocks containing 20 acres are on the Devil s Knob, or Wattle 1 lat Hill, about
li miles distant. . , , , „ , .
The crown of Surface Hill, which is over 1000 ft. above the level of the Turon River, may be
described as a network of leaders, and veins carrying rich gold. And, what is of still more importance,
is that the material between the veins also carries payable gold. ~ . . ,
Intersecting these veins are innumerable leaders carrying gold, and in the stone adjoining the
veins are quantities of decomposed pyrites. , , , ,
The lode runs almost north and south through the Coy s 3 blocks, and has been proved to carry
payable gold to a width of 600 feet, and throughout the whole length of the Coy s leases.
As an illustration of the richness of the leaders, a small quantity of 4£ tons of stone taken from
the northern 10 acre block returned, from a local Battery, after first having all the free gold washed
from it, lOoz. lldwt. A bag of the tailings was also sent to the Mines Department for assay, and the
return shows 20ozs. 9dwts. of gold, and lOozs. 7dwts. of silver per ton, which was not saved at the
local Battery. From this it will be seen that the veins and leaders are very rich indeed.
It is the intention of the Coy. to quarry the whole hill, and put everything through the battery.
It is estimated that the material delivered at the Crushing Plant, alongside the river, will not cost
more than Is. per ton, and that 7s. 6d. per ton, including the above will be the total cost of dealing
with the stone, or in other words, 2dwt. of gold per ton will cover all expenses, leaving everything over
and above that for division among the shareholders. - , , . .
Active operations are being carried on on the Surface Hill blocks, and already numerous veins of
rich gold-bearing quartz, through which the gold is plainly visible, have been crossed m the open
cutting, almost every day disclosing new ones. The two 10-acre blocks on the Devil s Knob, which
have been referred to, are on the same line of lode as the “ Queenslander ” which property is a very
'wtahaU for, the Company will be declared formed and registered.
No more need be said, except to refer intending shareholders to the accompanying report of Mr
Pleitner, of Adelaide, S.A., who was recommended to the promoters as being one of the best Gold
Mining Experts obtainable in the colonies.
Particular attention is directed to the fact that the vendors have such faith in the bona fides of the
property that they are asking no cash consideration whatever, taking full payment in shares ; so that
the whole of the subscribed capital, less expenses of flotation, will be available for the purchase and
erection of the best gold-saving machinery.
ROUGH ESTIMATE.
To show the enormous quantity of crushing stuff in sight to the present level:—
According to estimates there are two million seven hundred thousand (2,700,000) tons in sight.
One hundred (100) head of stampers would crush, roughly speaking, 60,000 tons per annum ; this
will give, at very low estimate, work for over thirty (30) years. W. PLEITNER, M.E.

Mr. James Kidman, the well-known
Sydney grocer and many other things besides, has
again scooped almost all the Government tenders
for 1896. The secret of this firm’s 56 years con-
tinuous success is that it is its own importer,
wholesale merchant, middleman, and wherever
possible its own grower as well. Mr. Kidman is
his own baker, having a large bakery in the city.
He has also a large butchery, and all the meat
supplied to customers is killed there. He has a
tea-plantation in Ceylon and another in China,
and all the teas supplied are of his own growing.
Kidman’s is a very extensive affair nowadays,
with three stables, 23 carts constantly employed
in the delivery of goods, 54 horses, 15 bakers and
a foreman, four or five men constantly employed
in the bottling department, an office staff of 17,
and 102 miscellaneous employes. It is re-
putedly the cheapest establishment in Aus-
tralia, which is evidenced by the fact that
Mr. K. is purveyor of all eatables and
drinkables to the military forces at Sydney, Wol-
longong, and Newcastle ; N.S.S. Sobraon ; Hos-

Dear Bulletin, —I know nothing abort
snakes swallowing snakes, but I to-day saw a
game-rooster swallowing a black snake about 18in.
long. The fowls of a neighbor were kicking up a
row, and on investigation the rooster was seen
with the snake caught by the neck strutting
proudly around. After several strenuous efforts
it got a fair start and gobbled it down. That was
eight hours ago, and the rooster has gone to its
perch as usual.—A. D. Mittagong, March 9.

A Martyr to Indigestion
PERMANENTLY CURED.
Mr. F. Wokfold, Taree, Manning River,
says : —“ Some years ago I suffered severely from
an ulcerated stomach, and ever since I have
been a martyr to Indigestion. I was led to try
BOOT’S INDIGESTION CURE, although I
had little faith in the possibility of medicine
affording me any relief. After taking a few
doses I was so free from pain that I put away
the remainder of the bottle. After several weeks
I had a slight return of my old complaint, but a
few doses of the ‘ CURE ’ soon drove it away
permanently. That one bottle I consider would
be cheap at a pound note. ”

In’62, writes “ Lycidas,” the flies on the
Barcoo were very bad. Hot meat was out of the
question, as it would get so thickly covered with
flies as to be uneatable. Sometimes even you had
to get inside your mosquito-curtain to eat your
salt beef, and ditto if you would read or write.
At night they would be so thick as to perfectly
blacken the grass outside the camp, and if you
went outside the tent they would rise up with
such a roar that you would be unable to hear the
horse-bells 100 yards away. The horses had a
terrible time —the flies settled on the corners of
their eyes and made sores as big as half-crowns.
Some of the men dressed their horses in calico to
protect them, and I remember one old fellow who
rode up to our camp at sundown with his horse
dressed in a comfortable suit of calico. He looked
a most curious object, and, as the sun was behind
him, you could see the flies, looking like half-a-
dozen swarms of bees, around him and his horse.
I never knew what a plague of ordinary flies was
before, but it is infinitely worse than one of mos-
quitos or sandflies. They have never been so bad
since.
Dr. Hope’s Liver and Blood Clarifying
Compound is recommended as a cure for every
disease which has its origin in a disordered condi-
tion of the blood. Long ago a philosopher, who
was far ahead of his era, reported that “ the blood
is the life,” and his statement has stood inspection
to this day. The diseases which begin with an
unwholesome condition of the blood are legion, and
a remedy that will repair that vital fluid covers a
vast extent of ground in the materia medica.*

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Hear Sir, In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E.
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint as
I had, which led me to try vour Remedies. On
Thursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

Button -collecting is the latest craze in
S o ?’ w, . lere one faddist has an assortment
SM he values at over £12,000. This is a chance

a quaint mixture of Oriental and
? hixury. A man who visited several of
rcopr,tTv ney v Chll V ese - s hop-keepers during their
recent Isew Year festivities describes the interior
ot their living rooms as ornate to a degree. The
is usually a spacious room,
wa ] ls of which runs a raised platform of
nnl-tl™ ' 0n surrounding the greater
fl?f v n i° f i t - e rooni ’ 1S a richly-upholstered divan,
Wie buck being of ebony grotesquely inlaid with
mother-of-pearl. On the walls, side by side
ith oil-paintings by European artists, are
tantastic specimens of the art of Cathay.
Numerous little earthenware brackets and pots
hear the luck-bringmg Chinese lily, while
on polished tables and sideboards of Euro-
pean design are masses of expensive blooms
, florists, while princely cohorts
I gold-top, whisky and other barbarian tipple
stand awaiting the attack of the hospitable cork-
screw. On a dais slightly raised above the level
ot the wall-encircling platform sits the principal
host, attired m yellow silk trousers of something
approaching peg-top pattern, mauve satin tunic
trogged with gold, and a massive gold chain of
Oanton workmanship, weighing from 40 to 00 oz.,
round his neck. His pigtail, eked out with a foot
or so of silken braid, reaches to the floor, and jigs
with reptilian activity as its possessor bows in
return to the salutations of his numerous visitors,
ihese consist of Chinese and Europeans in about
equal numbers—the latter chiefly representatives
ot the shipping, softgoods and hardware firms
with whom the Chinese magnate’s firm has deal-
ings. But ‘pidgin” is strictly tabooed, and the
conservative old Chinkie on the dais would resent
any reference thereto on such an occasion as an
unforgiveable breach of good manners.

‘Ten Tears’ Practice in Australia,” by
surgeon Iredell, of Melbourne, is a bright, chatty
booklet that may persuade here and there a
reader to take life a little more rationally. Mr.
Iredell, who has no fads to urge, throws in some
wise comments on the particular follies of Eat
Man. “ With increasing age and diminishing
powers a corresponding decrease in the quantity of
food must be taken in order to preserve health,” is
a precept handed down by Luigi Cornaro, a
Venetian born five and a-half centuries ago.
“ But,” says the Melbourne practitioner, “after in-
stilling this into a 16st. man, and obtaining a re-
duction of 2st. in weight, I had the satisfaction of
hearing that I was ruining his constitution, and it
had been necessary for him to take a tonic and
increased nourishment. Not only does the
patient himself become anxious as he loses
superfluous flesh, but his friends buzz round him
and tell him he is not looking up to the mark, and
object to his shadow ever growing less !! ” The
danger of passing from a busy state to otium cum
dignitate, when vitality begins to fail, is neatly
put: ‘‘ He suddenly takes the weight off the safety-
valve. He removes the cork from the bottle of
life. The internal pressure was already lowering ;
now rapidly it diminishes, escapes, and his
exhaustion takes no long time before it is com-
plete. Carefully, and with great judgment, should
such a man have lessened his work to suit his
altering fires, and no man is to be pitied less than
the man who is said to die in harness. ”

The most sordid and miserable tale of the
famous Jameson raid is that concerning the
flight of the Outlanders when the first trouble
began. Even before thenews reached Johannesburg
concerning the advance of the wild Caledonian
warrior from Buluwayo, a panic arose, and the
maddest skedaddle of modem times set in. Inside
of three days 20,000 people left for Natal or the
Cape.
Carriage compartments to hold 10 people had in them
from 17 to 20. On one train, two children were suffocated
by the crush. Their dead bodies were passed out of the
train at Bloemfontein. The smell from the overcrowding
was so bad that people could not stay in the station.
Several births took place in the crowded trains. One com-
partment that ought to hold eight had 17 in it when a
child was born. For the first few days people seemed to
go mad, and not to care what they did so long as they
got away from the town. An eye-witness said it was
agonising to witness the rush to obtain milk at the Bloem-
fontein buffet, as there was a great number of children of
such a tender age that they could partake of no other food
but milk —and there was none to be had. The hotels were
crowded to suffocation, and 30 women used one apartment
as a dressing-room.
A whole lot of elaborate reasons have been given
for the failure of the Johannesburgers to rise—
they were “ deceived ; ” they didn’t know Jameson
was coming ; they were told that he had been cap-
tured, and would be executed if they rose, so they
lay low from unselfish motives; they lay low because
the representative of their beloved Queen told
them to, &c., &c. But this new tale seems to sug-
gest another possibility—that they kept quiet from
unmitigated scare and cold perspiration. Ap-
parently, in these days, every soul who could get
into a train, even by sitting on the head of a dying
fellow creature, got in and bolted for his life, and,
in all probability, many others would have gone too
if they could have hung on to the buffer of the last
carriage and run behind. Not being able to get
away, they stayed behind and surrendered the City
of Dreadful Funk at the first time of asking.
There is a moral in the story. Almost any kind
of brawny white man will fight to the bitter end
for his home or his bark-hut and his country.
But in a mixed community, where the nigger re-
places the Aryan pick-and-shovel man, and the
white community is mostly Jews and stock-
brokers and speculators and “first robbers”
and shopkeepers, and there is only a stock ex-
change and a lot of British syndicates to fight for,
nobody really wants to fight.
Laureate Austin’s is one way of rhyming
about Jameson’s freebooting raid. Here is
another :
Jameson’s men into Krugersdorp’s
Glen rode clanking with swords on thighs ;
Jameson’s men left many a corpse
Staring at Heaven with glassy eyes.
“Oom Paul ” was but “a fat old man” ;
“ Jim” was going to “sour his ale.”
“ Oom Paul ” laughs as he drains his can ;
“Jim ” is now on his way to—gaol.
Or, at any rate, deserves to be. The soul of old
Lobengula must have shaken the rafters of Hades
with laughter when he heard from the latest
arrivals there how his enemies had eaten dirt in
their turn.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-cut No. 1,” “Cameo” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “ Pure Gold ” and “Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“ THREE CASTLES” and “ C-A.ZPST'.A.IIsrV 5
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“ Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

t\ ith the British heir are said to have offered to take an
little as £5OOO to square off some £30,000 advanced. The

“there was no ‘parting’ there.” The attorney fixed
them with a stony stare and said, “ You’d better a-et, hack
to Australia.” They demanded an explanation, but had to
go to another lawyer and pay for it. Then they found
that the heir s story was true in every particular so far as
it went, but that the executors had legal power, which the
heir had overlooked, to withhold money from any heir
who had been “playing it up” as the borrowe/had

Dear Bulletin,-The adhesion of many Aus-
tralian papers to the doctrine that money-lenders should
be allowed a free hand in fixing interest rates in their trans-
actions, and that Govt, interference in their business is
impolitic, rashly experimental, and almost certain to lead
to failure, is best answered by a few facts which these
papers ought to be acquainted with, but seemingly are
not. Almost every State of the U.S.-if not absolutely
every one-regulates the usurer’s interest, and some of
Jw* h 'u V f- d ? n s so . for I,iar D' years. The result shows
that such limitation is perfectly feasible, is not a rash or
novel experiment, and doesn’t necessarily lead to failure
In two States of the Union the law has fixed the maxi’
mum interest at 5 per cent. ; in 29 at 6 per cent, ; in 10 at
7 per cenb. ; in six at 8 per cent. ; in two at 10 per
cent., and m one at 12 per cent. The penalties for
exceeding the legal rate amount in some instances to a
total loss of the legally-allowed interest, and in others to
the loss of both principal and interest. In Columbia the
payer of usurious interest can recover it by legal process
within twelve months, in Delaware the usurer forfeits a
sum equal to the amount lent, in Florida he is liable to
pay double the amount he has charged over the legal rate
and in Arkansas negotiable paper tainted with usury is
void. In New Hampshire the usurer forfeits three times
the excess interest charged, while in South Dakota he not
only forfeits the interest, but is punishable by fine of
500dol. with six months’ imprisonment. To the terrible
vaticinations with which the daily press endeavor to scare
Australian Parliaments from dealing with the cormorant
usurer these living facts are the best reply.—Z.
Editor Bulletin, —Re usury. The other day I
offered a Melb. money-lender a deposit receipt, worth
on Change 10s. in £, as security for a loan of £4 for
a month. All he wanted was a bill at 30 days for £5.
Simply 300 per cent, per annum on security on which
any bank would give an immediate overdraft of £6O at
6 per cent, per annum.—P.P.

The lack of decent securities is playing havoc
with Melb. usurers. The high priest of the industry,
considering it cheaper to take a holiday than to lend his

Europe. In consequence, the jackal bill-shavers have
commenced to dispute for the boilers on the wharves.

Eor some time past the Sydney dailies have not
been publishing the values of the estates of deceased
persons, and this is the second occasion during the last
12 years in which such information has been withheld.
Now, why has matter of such peculiar interest been sup-
pressed? N.S.W. people are often informed by their own
newspapers of the sums left by wealthy men in the other
provinces, and even of the amounts left by persons belong-
ing to N.S.W. who had property elsewhere ; but as to how
much has been accumulated by deceased N.S. Welshmen
within the mother province, the Sydney daily press, for
some occult reason, maintains silence.

Dear Bulletin, — You say that a Bendigo man
holds that gold and quartz grow through the generating
influence of certain mineral-water constituents. I’m an
old miner of nearly 40 years’ experience. About quartz
growing, I cannot say ; but I know that gold grows, and
that spontaneously, without the application of mineral
water or anything else. Some 12 or 13 years ago I got a
lot of very handsome specimens from a lode near King-
lake. I carefully chipped off every particle of stone
showing visible gold, and threw the barren refuse into a
shed, lour years ago, I was making up a box of speci-
mens to send to my brother in London, and I rooted out
the stones I had thrown away years before. *On washing
them, I was astonished and delighted te see that they
were specked all over with gold. I take it that this is
proof positive that gold grows.— W. E. Harcourt. Moonee
Ponds, Vic.
Nehemiah Bartley, an old Brisbane (Q.) identity,
who died not very long ago, was sure that “ gold grows.”
He used to treasure a specimen which he had put in a
drawer when there was no trace of gold showing. Coming
across it several years later, he found thin streaks of gold
visible. He noted the circumstance as curious, put the
specimen back, and forgot about the matter till some
years after, when the streaks had “grown” right across
the face of the stone.
But gold doesn’t grow when carried in a man’s
pocket. Can that be because it has been smelted ?

The story of the money-changers being hunted
from the temple was lately turned t’otherside up by the
services of the Anglican Church being held in the Cool-

Victoria is developing a class of fruit"
pickers as distinct as the English hop-pickers'
They are a strange jumble of humanity. Lean>
sallow-faced youths, snowy - headed old men,
middle-aged wrecks, and even a few small boys
not yet in long trousers may be seen among them.
They all carry swags ; they all curse one another’s
eyes freely; and, on the whole, they use worse
language than the ordinary wallaby-track swaggy.
When on tramp they always send the smallest
“ kids ” in their ‘ ‘ push ” up to the houses for food.
They know that a woman who will refuse to feed a
man will often soften to a youngster.
One of Premier Kingston’s latest enemies
is old John Warren, M.L., a Tory squatter, who
has been on the stump in the interests of the
National Thistle. Warren is the legislator who
once asked a question in Parliament re the cost of
the Happy Valley waterworks, and when the
Govt, supplied him with the figures, John calcu-
lated that the country was going to the dogs to
the extent of .£lOO,OOO a year through this scheme.
Apparently he worried over the matter, and
couldn’t sleep for indignation at this latest iniquity
of Kingston’s, and he therefore asked a question
in the Council about five yards long. This ques-
tion explained the whole matter. Warren had
made a mistake of £lOO,OOO in his addition, and
when they led him away quietly to a cool spot
and explained that the deficiency was John’s
and John’s only, he collapsed. Eor months
after, when he had to do any calculations, he used
to have them audited by three reliable accountants
“ for greater accuracy. ” But that mistake in old
John’s addition made him Kingston’s enemy for
life.

Barber
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Barber was the sourest man everybody had ever
met. He was a long, thin, lugubrious wretch,
with hollow cheeks, hollow eyes, and a hollow
chest, and an appearance of being the victim of
merciless dyspepsia. But Barber was in excellent
health, and had never had occasion to spend a
copper on “doctors’ stuff ”in all his life. Barber
was fortunate : three parts of his land was the
best in the district, it was bisected by a creek, and
the spring in his well never wholly failed even in
time of fiercest drought. He was a flourishing
settler, and things went well with him, and yet he
always affected to be more miserable than the
legendary “orphan bandicoot on a burnt ridge,”
and wailed eternally to his friends and family
about his awful luck. He preached his belief that
Heaven and Gehenna were leagued against him,
and when anything unfortunate happened,
drought, fire, or flood, it was “just my luck ! ” and
Barber’s utterly woebegone appearance was quite
commensurate with his dreadful fate as the butt
of angels and devils.
One day the settler was running a furrow across
what he called his back paddock. The ground
was hard, and necessitated a good team. Presently
the share struck an immovable object, and a minor
catastrophe followed. Barber had a fall, and sus-
tained superficial injuries to the jaw, and the team
got mixed up with the plough, and broke things
in ' he excitement of the moment.
Three hours later it was known to everyone
within a radius of ten miles that Barber had struck
a rich reef in his back paddock.
Inquiring friends found Barber mounting guard
over his reef and a barrow-load of dazzling speci-
mens.
“ How about your luck now, old party ? ” some-
body asked.
“Dunno, dunno,” replied Barber, miserably.
“Look at that plough o’ mine—mined, simply
ruined! ”

I have sold tea on a large and small scale around
Geelong and Mt. Brown. I have originated a
peculiar brand of dysyiepsia from Murray Bridge
to the Towers. My blends are unequalled. And
I know my business. An ordinary man may sell
tea, if he has a decent moustache, a pair of legs,
and can talk lies over the fence. It happens,
however, that in appearance I am but once re-
moved from the ape.
Years ago a man discovered me on the Circular
Quay. He gave me some advice and 10s., because
I was uglier than anything he had ever seen. “ Go
into the country,” he said, “ and sell something.
Tell fortunes, you ugly little beggar.” This man
put bread in my way when he taught me the trick
of fortune-telling.
* * * *
At the end of one hot January day, I dragged
myself along the sun-split road that follows the
Darling into Wilcannia. A woman’s voice crooned
from a tidy little cottage ; there was a smell of
new bread and pastry. I hurried past. Suddenly
her voice filled the air, and the household swarmed
to the gate. “ Here’s Quilp, quick; come and see
Quilp ! ” I turned in the middle of the road and
put on a Cheshire smile. God ! how those kids
howled when I limped off like Richard the Third !
* * * *
There’s a piece of country on the Darling that I
bar at present. I’m living down something I said
there a year ago.
It was getting late when I crawled into
Puncher’s Crossing, with the horse going on three
legs. Several “ cookies ” passed me on the way,
but they had always pulled up for a chat and a
kindly word. Into their ears went my secret, the
secret that fled to every homestead within ten
miles before sundown. Monsieur Pompadour,
the magician, is en route —the magician who
pierces the heart’s depths by glancing at your
little fat hand. Fin Maloney owned the pub.,
store, and newspaper at Puncher’s; and after
being sniffed at by hostile dogs, into Fin’s pub. I
hobbled.
* * * • *
Eight o’clock ! How the time passed. There
were noises in the parlor ; heavy breathings and
suppressed mirth. Good ! I threw myself into a
chair on the verandah. A mop of yellow hair
peered at me from the half-closed door. I main-
tained a commendable silence. Eve spoke.
“ Would you like to come inside ? ”
Business is business, so I went in. There were
fifteen girls there and one big man. He offered
me some tobacco, which was taken as men take
salt in the East.
(To-morrow I would ‘ ‘ plant ” a few hundred-
weight of tea on the strength of this performance.)
“ My gel here heard as you were pretty good at
readin’ fortunes. She’s worried at me till I had
to bring her over. These are my gel’s friends,
mister. ” I bowed. Lord ! how pretty are some
of my countrywomen: peeping brown faces, all
too quickly sullied by the wicked shadows of men !

Fortune-telling out-back requires brains. Each
one must have something different, and there are
some awful combinations in 15. In the majority
of cases, you may kill husband the first with per-
fect safety, providing that the void created is
filled. They are touchy anent the old dying rela-
tive, and the. old, old pile. I married the first one
right awai' to 6ft. of gum. “ Would I describe
him ? ” Certainly. He never wore a waistcoat;
summer or winter ; he could sit any horse south
of the line. Didn’t go in for shearing now, but
when he did he was a “ringer.” On Saturday
nights it was his custom to fight about three men.
Tight pants—and big feet. There was a great
clapping of hands, a lot of pushing and laughter.
Everyone recognised him immediately ; the name,
“Jim Saunders,” was whispered through the
room. The girl fled to the verandah to hide her
flaring, happy face. All the others made similar
journeys when the dark, tall gentleman turned
up. (It is always a safe card to keep out short
men : they don’t live up there. Every man is
longer than Adam.)
* * * *
Now, there remained one who had sat quiet
throughout, although she was frequently whis-
pered to. She was partially hidden by a screen of
heavy cloth, but I knew that hers was the sweetest
face in the room. In the midst of the babble I
caught her hand gently—small, white, baby
fingers that did not shrink from mine as others
had. Her face became filled with an intense
eagerness at the beginning. Into her future I
threw those bright phantasms that crowd the
minds of children. A tiny castle was built near
the sea, towering amongst rock, fern, and moun-
tain heather. Then a deadly silence crept over all.
For one brief minute I knelt at her feet. It was
not for me to touch that wondrous hand with my
hideous, twisted lips : let the gabbling tongue put
one iota of pleasure into her fancy, and I would
be happy. And yet I had made a mistake ; it was
in every face. I stood up, still holding her hand.
And she was crying softly, her head down in the
cushions. I limped to the door, a fraud, a failure.
What I had said to that blind child let me not
recall.

Ordinary household kerosene is an excel-
lent antiseptic for wounds and ulcers. It produces
quick healing, is economical, non-poisonous, and

Rev. Zillmann, lecturing in Melb. on the
Coming Revolution :
When the candle of popular education gets in and the
powder-barrel of popular suffrage burns down to the
powder, there will be an explosion which will send
thrones, despots and aristocracies to their individual
nothingness.
Strange words to fall from reverend lips !
It is remarked that the ’Murkan jingo
newspapers, whilst endeavouring to stir up an-
tipathy to Britain over the Venezuela matter;
didn’t appeal to the anti-Saxon sentiment of the
local Irish population. And it is inferred there-
from that the Irish must have waived their ancient
grievance for the moment, like a tempestuous wife
who rows with her husband in the street until an
unwise bystander calls him a brute. “ The Wear-
ing of the Green,” with its “ Ould Ireland never
will get back the blood she has shed,” is a fine
ditty, but very misleading. For every half-pint
of Celtic gore shed in the Home Rule cause, a
hogshead has been freely sacrificed for the benefit
of the dirthy Saxon. The Irish regiments fight
not for their native isle but for “ Great Britain.”
And Fenianism, when it outbreaks upon the ould
sod, is suppressed by English and Scotch regi-
ments.
More voices from Rue Australia wail in a
London paper:—
The New Arcadia, which was to give the signal for a
social revolution to wondering mankind, has dwindled
down to a little cluster of shabby, half-savage, and more
than half-starved settlements in Paraguay, their chief
characteristics being a painful want of clothes and a
perpetual ebullition of quarrels. New Australia still
counts 250 members, but only 85 of these are men, and
the classification of occupations is very curious, including
as it does “one dancing master” and “one stump orator
(professional).” The original community has thrown off
about half a dozen distinct secessions, and is now broken
up into five separate settlements, at an average distance of
about two miles apart from each other. The standard of
living in these communities is sinking steadily in comfort;
the communities themselves, as a matter of fact, are laps-
ing from civilisation into barbarism. Butter is unknown,
matches are forgotten, sugar has become a mere
memory, flour is a medical comfort, a mutton chop is
a lost ideal. For months not only the Pilgrim Fathers
but their wives and children have been soapless. For two
weeks the community has lived on beans; and the
very beans, Mr. Lane confesses with a sigh, were
bought on credit. Money, of course, has disappeared,
and with it have vanished hats, shoes, candles, &,c. The
children are growing up without education, aud the
adults have pretty well dispensed with religion. The
atmosphere of gross Materialism is most deplorable in its
effects. Knowing the inner workings of our several Little
Peddlingtons, I repeat that Communism pure and simple
is imaginary rot. Co-operation without capital in a mixed
crowd, and on the lines we are following, is an utter mis-
take. We are drifting to speedy destruction. Com-
munism destroys industry, for the Communists them-
selves won’t work. The idle man under a Communistic
system is to be paid as well as the industrious man ; the
fool is to be as much honored as the sage. How this
system lowers the productive power of a community is
conclusively shown by New Australia. It consisted of
picked men ; it started with an average capital of £6O per
head ; it is set on fertile soil, and under genial skies. It
is, in brief, “a free body of associated workers,” with
free land, and no “ encumbrances ” in the way of
capitalists or parasites. But the average production
of each worker is less than £lO per head per annum !
There is absolutely no regard for common property. No
one will take the responsibility of checking the children
when destroying the fruit trees. Tools and implements
are lost, mislaid, or destroyed in the most disgraceful
manner. At the Las Ovejas settlement last year the
melon beds were trampled on by adults and children as
if invaded by a herd of wild elephants, and thousands of
melons were broken open—to see if they w-ere ripe—and
not one was allowed to come to maturity. It is nobody’s
business to look after public property. The elective board
of management changes its personality, on an average,
every six weeks. Everybody is jealous of everybody else.
The settlers quarrel furiously over the distribution of
a few grains of sugar or a few handfuls of beans. Any
windy stump orator who happens to come along can turn
them around his thumb. They will reverse their votes
on any subject within a week. No democratic community
can live where the units do not form and exercise their
own opinions. Two months ago 65 to 41 decided on
altering the constitution to single-tax lines. Last week
■ 83 to 23 voted against any change of rules on those lines.
Melbourne people are now quite en rapiport
with the doings of the honorary magistracy.
Evangelist Yatman’s story of the Mel-
bourne pietist who got <£2oo to meet a bill, by
simple prayer, has set a lot of ex-boomers on their
knees again. Previously, when they wanted =£2oo

The Bulletin even has faith in the preyer.
The financial ruin of the Cubans in the last
revolt threw nearly all the property in the island
into the hands of native-born Spaniards, and, as
the latter have now to bear the whole burden
of taxation, they are beginning to hope for the

gig of Time bring his revenges ! ”

Earth is full of groans and sighs,
Wailings of distress,
Curses, too ; his ears and eyes
Fatman closes ; crassly wise
Thinks they are but empty cries
In the wilderness.
Whom the gods would slay they drive
Mad, of old was said.
Fatman’s mad and doomed to dive
Deep, to where his victims strive,
Struggling hard for bread.
Yet all in vain
Will be the gain,
Ev’n if his blood be shed.
Other Fatmen will arrive—
Drones within the human hive—
And the race will keep alive
Till the devil’s dead.
The Last of the Bohemians.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
A tall, shambling, loosely-built man with long,
thick, wavy hair down over the collar of his coat,
which fits him anyhow.
His mane - that’s the word—after being torn
into a “ parting ” on the right side, is swept across
the head down over the left brow and behind the
long, narrow ears.
Bright brown eves in a worn face wearing a
long, inverted-M-shaped beard. The hair is very
dark—without artifice—considering he is well over
eighty, and by many suspected of being a hundred.
He usually sits in the dignified grandeur of a
solemn silence in London’s one genuine Bohemian
Club.
A strikingly picturesque figui'e, and an enor-
mously interesting personality. Keen and quick
as a machine-needle in repartee, and gifted with
an excessively droll and tropically dry humor.
He is said to be one of the cleverest raconteurs
in London ; and his delivery of Marcus Clarke’s
mock-heroic “Bill Jinks” would convulse a stack
of church elders.
No one knows where he lives, or how.
A sporting member made a wager he would
track the hoary hare to his “ form.”
The H.H. left the club well into the early hours
of a summer’s morning, and the S.M. followed.
Hour by hour he was led in a slow, sauntering,
“ home-was-never-like-this ” manner, up street,
through square and circus, and down alley ; along
puzzling passage and tortuous tunnel; out of the
city of Clubland to the suburbs of Snoring Sleep,
and back again ; he helped the moon to bed at
St. John’s Wood, and the sun to rise at the Isle of
Dogs. At last, when the stars sank back in the sky,
wearied with watching the monotonous meander-
ings, when the pursuer’s knees were kissing like
castanets, and he was too exhausted to be any
longer cautious in the chase, his queer quarry
turned suddenly, fresh as the lark’s voice above
them that greeted the dawn : “ Ah ! old fellow,
how are you; out for an early stroll?” And
while the stupefied S.M. stammered incoherently,
lie added, “I’m just off to Margate for a bath I
Good morning.”
London, Jan., ’96.

IS A l HAN HERMAN, “ Misfit Parlor,” Sydney.
Dear Sir Your Bale and other goods to hand some time ago, but
through the pa-tt dry weather I have been kept so busy that I have not
had the opportunity of writing before. Referring to the the £2 Bale
of fit-out I must most certainly say it is the best value I have ever seen
or heard of the suit being an admirable fit, and you may depend that
in future whatever I require in any way I will procure at your house,
and will advise as many as possible to patronise you. As lam well-
known in the district, no doubt you will obtain a good many orders, as
I will do my utmost to secure you patronage. You may, if you choose,
put this into any paragraph or translation you choose and publish it if
it is of any service to you, as no one once purchasing from you will ever
deny the fact of the cheapness and durability of the articles purchased.
Enclosed please find 7s. 6d. in stamps, for which please forward by
return of post one of your Watches and Chains, as I want it for one of
my boys. Trusting you will favor by return of post,
I remain, yours faithfully, W. H. COCHRANE.

‘‘Sir, —I received my bale, and I was very much surprised at the
contents. I am sure I could not get the same materials up here for
double the money. Allowing you to make any use you like with this
note, I remain, respectfully yours, ROSE HOPKINS.”
_ West Hillgrove, January 24, 1895.
NATHAN HERMAN, Esq.
Dear Sir—l am just in receipt of your favor of 22nd instant, and
the Watch, for which accept my best thanks. I think I will be able to
give you an order for one or two more shortly. My own is still keeping
splendid time. By all means publish my letter. I think the general
public should know what good value you are giving for the money. I
am well-known here and in Armidale and Melbourne.—Believe me,
yours sincerely, JOHN M‘BEAN, Senr.
Salisbury Villa, Peel and Piper Streets, Bathurst, Nov. 13, 1895.
Dear Sir, —Yours of the 11th inst. to hand, and am much pleased
in replying to it. For two years I have been purchasing teas from you,
and they have given me and all visitors the utmost satisfaction and are
superior to tea that before I had given 2s. a lb. for in Bathurst, and
you are quite at liberty to make use of this as a testimonial. —Yours
truly, SAMUEL STOW.
NATHAM HERMAN, Esq., 9 Wynyard-street, Sydney.
These proofs of what can be got at the MISFIT PARLOR are
positively genuine, as some of the know-alls may shake their heads
and perhaps doubt it. For the information of those who perhaps may
not be aware of the fact, I assert that no newspaper will publish any
letter without the Original Copy, and I am willing to hand over J 2500
to local charities if anyone can refute the veracity of such testimonials.
