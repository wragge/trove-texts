THE ELEY GASTIGHT
WATER-RESISTING CARTRIDGE
Sportsmen have long appreciated the fine shooting qualities of the Eley
gastight cartridge-—“the standard by which quality is judged.”
This standard has now been raised : the case, giving the same fine
shooting, is ffow made water-resisting as well, and is consequently
becoming more than ever popular.
After testing these cartridges "The Field” described their pressures and
velocities as "excellent,” their turnovers as "in every case firm and
strong,” apd their resistance to damp or water as "far superior to any
other make of cartridge.”

The New Drama
The great novel of the war is still. to be
written. In poetry, with the exception ot
a few isolated instances that bear the stamp
of timelessness, there is small trace ot any .
new shaping force. If the. war has lixid. .any
direct influence in the world of letters its
quickening power is to be felt m the belt
of drama, and there alone. The \number ot
plays published in the last year in the Eon-
temporary British Dramatists series sug-
gests a renaissance of the theatre that sets
one inevitably thinking of the spacious
clays of the Mermaid and the Globe, ihe
outstanding feature of the plays of all these
neo-Georgians is the amazingly subtle ease
and resourcefulness of their technique, and
in one or two, at least, the originality ot
their subjects. They do not trade in poetry.
Creativeness, in the large sense, is not then-
strong point.
For the average reader, who m the last
resort is not such a bad judge, after all,
authors are of two kinds only. There is the
man who can invest everyday people and in-
cidents with a certain poetry or picturesque-
ness that lifts them above the mere common-
place. His public is large because very few
can resist the fascination of familiar things.
The writer who by his powers of presenta-
tion and suggestion can express the super-
natural, abnormal or fantastic in such a
way as to compel our willing belief in them
has a more restricted appeal. Hard and
fast distinctions are misleading: lew of the
Elizabethans, for instance, especially the
playwrights, could make up their minds
w-hicli side of the debatable ground they be-
longed to, for, red-blooded realists as they
were, they leaned towards portents and prodi-
gies. The Georgian playwright has a similar
function ; but it is not sufficient for him to
plough strange seas and bring his slap sate
into harbor with the golden fleece ot rich
America aboard. The vexed Bermoothes and
the seacoast of Bohemia have forfeited then-
magic charm of infinite suggestion. Realism
and mystery we must have, but the contem-
porary dramatist must serve up romance with
a difference. If he is to capture his audience
he must shed about them the glamor of worlds
unrealised, pique their consciousness, and
sometimes make them shudder a little by
putting them on nodding acquaintance with
“unfamiliar modes of being.”
In “Magic Hours” Mr. Howard Peacey
very credibly insists on the dramatic possi-
bilities of the unseen. The action shifts from
the staff messroom on a Malayan rubber
estate to a hotel in Singapore, to the orange-
groves of California and back to "the East
in the deck-cabin of a cargo-boat. Fenton,
a young ex-service man, has been appointed
assistant to Kimber, a. strong and not un-
likeable man, whose loyalty to the share-
holders amounts to a religion. Fenton lias
a kind of dual personality. Both he and
Wray, who has lost a son on active service,
believe in “the silent army,” though not in
the spirit-rapping fashion. Wray, Ivimber
and the Chinese “boy” hean a wailing sound
which they believe comes from the ghost of
young Pawley, a former assistant, who, in
completing the process of being “made a
man” by Kimber, has committed suicide.
Fenton refuses to superintend the flogging
of two natives under Kimber’s orders. He
is dismissed, and goes out to California,
where he falls in love with Barbara. Pre-
sently he is “wanted” for the manslaughter of
a native. He protests his innocence, and
he and Barbara set out for Singapore in a
cargo-boat. The night before they land there
F'enton makes a desperate effort to force
Kimber to acknowledge his innocence by
appealing to his imagination. If he can once
make the absent Kimber conscious of his
existence and his suffering the way is clear.
Warned of the danger, he replies: “No more
danger than to a wireless operator.” He then
“thinks himself ” into the messroom in moods
varying from violence to persuasion, and,
finally, exaltation. The curtain falls with Fen-
ton in a trance. The next scene takes us back
to Kimber. The .Chinese “boy” is aware of
some presence that is not Pawley. Kimber s
speech shows that the time-worn soliloquy
can be intensely dramatic, given the right
handling. His imagination is appealed to
and stimulated, yet he does not lose his grip
on reality, till he is driven by fear of mad-
ness to call upon tlie powers of light and then
of darkness to silence the whisperings around
him.
According to Sir Thomas Browne, we
carry with us the wonders we seek without
us; there is all Africa and her prodigies in
us.” “Magic Hours” embodies this idea.
The strength of the play lies in the deft
mingling of the natural and the supernatural
in such a way that, though the interest is
mainly psychological, it never ceases to be
dramatic. The supernatural is not dragged
in as a mechanical device for effecting a
“happy” ending. It is simply a contributing
force. Whatever tragedy there is comes from
within; there is a suggestion of inevitability
from the moment Fenton is introduced.
Kimber is made of such stuff that he gives
the impression that the end is hastened but
not brought about by Fenton’s psychic “wire-
less.” Similarly, Fenton has not escaped the
fates by means of Kimber’s confession. Actu-
ally he has strengthened Fate’s hold over
him, because Kimber’s suicide has tran-
scended everything that he intended. Re-
morse for Kimber’s death will never quite
cease to weigh upon his consciousness, if not
upon his conscience.
Without much pretention to literary merit
“Beggar on Horseback.” by Kaufman and
Connelly, lias a certain interest for the theat-
rical innovations it suggests. It is a satiri-
cal extravaganza which might better be de-
scribed as an alarm and an excursion in
stage technique. The main theme is “de-
rived” from a German pre-war play, though
the setting and treatment are American. The
symbolism typical of Maeterlinck and all the
more spectacular mechanical stage devices
are enlisted. In the “simultaneous” dialogue
and speeches the methods of the cinema can
be traced; even the mime or ballet plays its
part. It is a dream-play, but the authors’
traffic in the sub-conscious leans to revue
rather than research. By a series of trans-
formations the action mokes in topsy-turvy
Alice-in-Wonderland fashion, the first part
ending with the murder of a family cn masse,
perpetrated by the Beggar with a paper-
knife. The stage directions which follow are
worthy of quotation :
Six reporters enter. * .
The Beggar: “Well, gentleman,, jt's a 1 ng story.
(Instantly a dozen newsboys rush down the aisles
of the theatre cryiny “Extra! Extra! All about-
the murders.” The- din is terrific. Simultaneously
the theatre lights up; the audience turns for a
second look at the newsboys, and in that second the
curtain falls. The newsboys pass out copies of the
Moitxixo-EvExijfG containing a full account of the
quadruple murder.”')
Probably it was Mr. G. K. Chesterton who
said there is no subject about which a modern
writer may not write a play, especially if
it is a bad play. “Beggar on Horseback”
is not a bad play. It is hardly a play at
all. It shows us Nature through a looking-
glass, something as Alice saw it. Yet at
odd moments the fantasy has touches of
truth that bind it closer to contemporary
reality than most of the “society”, drama
written by the exasperatingly clever young
men who tread close on the shadows of the
Restoration playwrights but never quite
catch up to them.
E. M. L.
Freedom of Ignorance
When Rome took over the guardianship
of human civilisation many curious spots of
barbarism were permitted to remain. The
great formalities were sprinkled with absurdi-
ties ; the rigid law bent at unexpected places
and allowed elements of anarchy to obtrude.
Side by side with the great temples and
magnificent homes of the rich remained the
reeking slums of the Subura; and while the
splendid Roman matron went by in hex-
dainty littex*, her poorer sisters raised harsh
voices in anger or persuasion about the mar-
ket stalls of the Forum, interspersing their
speech with the coarsest invective. The
Roman mob had always the privilege of
laughing at its masters, and there was always
a laugh for the coarse jest at the expense
even of the greatest. The soldier’s privileges
were extraordinary. To sing and shout ribald
remarks about their own Imperator was one
of them. Even at the great triumph of
Julius Caesar his veteran legionaries chanted
at the head of the procession “Romans, look
oiit for your wives! Here comes our old
bald-headed cuckold!” And the amazing
thing about it was that such ribaldry was
not intended for insult, but in line with
the Roman notion of showing the highest
honor to a leader. The custom went even
farther; for on the occasion of great funerals
lampoons on the dead were , not thought out
of order. Julian’s burial —later than the
middle of the fourth century —called forth
torrents of abuse from his enemies and
panegyrics which seemed td magnify his
faults from his friends.
Our own many-sided civilisation, though
so different in pattern from that of Rome,
has elements that bear a somewhat similar
relationship to the whole. Australia as heir
to and co-partner in all the world has
achieved lacks little of which any other land
can boast. Active minds are everywhere
laying the foundations of a greater future.
The wonderful ways of wireless are ours ;
the control of the air comes more and more
within our grasp. Abstract and experimental
sciences ai*e slowly unfolding strange things
to Australians as to others; we have our
artists, our poets, our inventors. The
trained mind goes higher and higher; the
disciplined will is capable of all things. Yet
our easy toleration of barbarism is as marked
as that of the Romans. True, it is barbar-
ism in comparatively small things; but those
small things go far towards making up the
sum of life. We have built up our castles of
stone and brick in every city street at enor-
mous cost; yet we allow the hideous discord
of the newspaper seller at every corner. He
is privileged to thrust unclean hands in your
face, to howl in your ear, to block your path
with his importunity and to add a touch of
barbarity to city life which no builder or
architect can possibly l-edeem. The cheerful
drunk with a pocketful of prawns may turn
a railway journey into a nightmare for nine
perfectly quiet citizens, and as long as he
possesses a railway-ticket he has committed
no offence. A modern caveman, bathless for
the term of his natural life, may force his
highly-flavored presence on the most deli-
cately dressed lady under certain circum-
stances, and have an official blessing on his
presence in a cramped compartment if he
has paid his license in the form of a fare.
The right to commit such injuries under our
remarkable form of civilisation is always
cheap.
Our easy acceptance of unpleasant things
because they happen to exist sometimes
touches major matters. We spend a very
large sum on what is called education or
public instruction of the young. An elabor-
ate system has been built up with the
general idea of spreading a high level of cul-
ture through the masses of the people; and
there has been a good deal of disappoint-
ment among earnest theorists at the poverty
of results. What these earnest theorists do
not take into account is that education is a
thing of environment. For one lesson learned
in the schoolroom ten are learned in the
street, the shop, or the playing-field. The
popular amusements are, above all, the
school of youth; and every clown who stands
on a barrel outside a side-show is a more
potent schoolmaster than the one paid by the
State to teach. In the matter of plain
speech in the English language, which is
really the key of all, we are as ridiculous as
any Roman leader who allowed himself to
be represented as a libertine by his legion-
aries. Speech is the key of all, because with-
out accurate grammatical speech there can
be no accurate and exact thinking; yet any
ignoramus can set up as a popular instruc-
tor to lead his hearers into inaccuracy of
thought. In doing so he largely destroys the
work of the schools, lowers the national

Mrs. Parker’s Problem
you know Mrs. Parker She lives in your street. She is a
typical A ustralian wife whose husband receives a moderate
wage. They are buying their own home and are giving their
children the best education they can afford. Mrs. Parker finds,
as a consequence, that she can spend but little money on clothes
and yet her friends and neighbours, who are in similar
circumstances, appear to dress so Well. How can she manage?
Silk stockings are a case in point.
Naturally, she always desired them,
but believed that their expense was
not justified. Therefore she tried to
content herself with cheap artificial
silk, knowing in her heart of hearts
they looked just what they were.
At last she decided she would have
better stockings, and invested 6/11
in a pair of Bond’s “Stjlk-A.rto” which
was hardly extravagance ! Then she
made an astounding discovery! She
found that the beautiful silken texture she had
admired on the hosiery of her friends was the
texture of Bond’s “Sij[k-Arto” And a few
months of wear has taught her that the service
of “sy/A>Arfo” means true economy—that she
obtains more lasting satisfaction from a single
pair of “sy/fc-Arfo” than from three or four
pairs of the so-called cheap stockings she had
previously worn. Her problem was solved!
The experience of Mrs. Parker will be your experience too, if
you
ask your draper for "Sylk~Ario” the next time you are buying
hosiery. In a range of 80 beautiful shades, seam at back

A Paranoiac Papua
A great many folk who explore the corners
of the earth under the guidance of books
must have come to the conclusion that
Papua, in the early stages of its develop-
ment at least, was inhabited and administered
by paranoiacs, who, white and brown alike,
lived in a mist of illusion of their own
creation. The Experiences of a A ew Guinea
Resident Magistrate, by C. A. YY. Monckton,
F 11.G.5., F.Z.S. and F.R.A.I. (John Lane),is
calculated to foster rather than dispel the
conclusion. The book is a story o 1 some
12 years spent in l’apua as trader.
Government agent and Government official
during the period when the Possession passed
from the control of the British Colonial
Office to that of the Australian Common-
wealth. . .
The volume is not less entertaining to
those who, like myself, were contemporaries
of the author in Papua, than it lias proved
to many another who has not enjoyed that
advantage. More than once I have, been
asked by Papuan officials and other residents
of a later day if the Papuans, white or
brown, ever really spoke and behaved as they
do in the “Reminiscences,” or if life in the
Possession in those days was one long string
of dramatic situations from which people
were for ever being extricated by C. A. W.
Monckton. To speak dispassionately and
without prejudice, one must return a quali-
fied answer to both queries. In the popular
tongue of the “movies,” the actors on Monck-
ton ’s screen are “made up,” the incidents
gain a good deal from the artistry of the
producer, and the scenario has been heavily
cut to suit the star.
In compiling his book the author has
evidently relied a good deal on the. earlier
annual reports of British New Guinea, in
which every official’s story of the year was
set out in full detail. This will explain the
fact that, though he did not come to New
Guinea till near the end of Sir William Mac-
gregor's reign, and did not enter the Govern-
ment service till two years after that, lie
has much to say of the great Administrator’s
earlier work, which lie had no opportunity
of judging at first hand. But Monckton
had, probably, better opportunities of seeing
Papua as it was a generation ago than any
other of the old-time officials who are still
alive. Sir . William Macgregor and Mathew
Moreton both died without leaving any record
of their unique experiences, and Monckton
might have contributed, in their stead, some-
thing of real importance to Papuan litera-
ture. That he should have put the chance
aside, and made nothing of those invaluable
years but a combination of a clironiquc scan-
daleuse and a laudation of his own small
part in petty affairs is to be regretted.
The book begins with the author’s arrival
in Papua in the role of trader in 1595. Much
may be forgiven to the writer of memoirs
in the matter of apparent egotism, but the
sustained symphony in the key of “I” is a
weariness of the flesh long before the ending.
The trading venture failed in due course, and
Sir William Macgregor, being hard pressed
for officers, offered the ex-trader a billet as
Assistant-Resident Magistrate. Odd jobs ,in
various corners of the Possession occupied
him till the coming of Sir William Mac-
gregor’s successor, Le Hunte, and the latter
sent Monckton to found a new Government
station at Tufi, on Cape Nelson. The forma-
tion of this division, the North-Eastern, gave
Monckton the chief opportunity of his career,
for though he later went to the Northern
Division, with its goldfields, his work there
was the continuance of conditions long estab-
lished.
In his story the author . skips from one
personal experience to another, with no
attempt to glance aside at other objects of
interest, however important. Through his
pages move a succession of strange figures,
of which not the least strange is his own, as
seen with his own eyes. There is an atmo-
sphere of Surreyside melodrama, and the
dialogue often smacks of Mr. Vincent
Crummies, flavored with the noble redskins
of Fenimore Cooper. On the beach at
Samarai the author is gloomily pondering
on his future. “See me to-morrow,” says a
mysterious figure, passing on ; “I have work
in hand for ye,” and vanishes, no doubt with
a finger on lips that mutter “Hist,” though
the book does not say so. It is Sir William
Macgregor, and the work is the rouseabout
job of A.R.M. But how much better it
sounds when told in Monekton’s way! Never-
theless, there- is descriptive power in the
stories of some of the expeditions, notably
that against the cannibal-raiders of the
Doriri tribe, on the north-east coast. The
matter-of-fact accounts of the shooting 1 down
of the opposition, and the burning of aban-
doned villages, which were a commonplace
of such expeditions in those days, will no
doubt read strangely to the Papuan patrol-
officer of more enlightened times.
An irritating aspect of the “Remi-
niscences” is the unblushing stress laid on
the author’s courage, resourcefulness and
general mental and physical superiority to
all his comuanions. in or out of the service.
Worse than that, he has stooped to make
others the butt of his humor or contempt,
and has not hesitated to level his criticism
at dead men. His police are the best dis-
ciplined in all Papua, and his village con-
stables and headmen are models of deport-
ment and conscious rectitude. The most
scoundrelly trader, the oiliest missionary
and the most rabid miner are worsted, time
and time again, when they venture to go up
against the author. Most strange, perhaps,
of all the obsessions which the book reveals
is Monckton’s entire conviction of the worth-
lessness of anything “colonial,” whether in
human form or otherwise, and his reverence
for everything English. This in spite of the
fact that nine-tenths of the men who opened
up Papua were “colonials,” and Australians
at that, and that Monckton was himself a
i\Jaorilander born and bred. It is not diffi-
cult to imagine that it was the ever-brooding
thought of this handicap which has given
such an embittered tone to the “Reminis-
cences” when they touch on people who, at
least, suffered his idiosyncrasies without open
blasphemy, for the most part.
Kind circumstance rescued Monckton from
the degradation of a “colonial” environment.
Ensconced in the England he loves so well,

Ci ne - came ra Shooting
{Time was when the hunter of big game
in Central Africa went out with massive
elephant-guns and a ponderous equipment of
other weapons of varied calibre. Nowadays
he gets just as much adventure and far more
profitable returns from a camera. Inciden-
tally, he may write a book, for there is a
very considerable body of readers who turn
with relief from the contemplation of modern
civilised life to the frequently more common-
sense arrangements of colored brother in the
wilderness. F. Iiateliffe Homes caters for
both readers and spectators in Through
Wildest Africa (Geoffrey Bles), a fairly
well-written and copiously-illustrated book.
True, pretty well all he has to say about ele-
phants, hippos, lions, tigers, zebras and the
rest of the jungle’s outfit has been said
already. But his method of shooting them
for the larder of the movie-show has a new
interest. And no doubt the animals them-
selves prefer it.
Experience early taught this new genera-
tion of hunters that if really intimate studies
of animals Were to be obtained “it could only
be in some region quite remote from the small-
est degree of civilisation, where animals had
not yet been harassed by man." They began
by stalking the animals, but the more they
stalked the more the animals receded. A
brilliant snap of their tails was not the
result sought, So this method was aban-
doned ; the new hunters determined to allow
the animals to come to them. This, it is
declared, “is the only method by which re-
sults worth having can be obtained,” and
it carries “all the interest, all the sport, all
the excitement, and all the danger of hunt-
ing with a mere rifie.”
They soon found they had no fools to deal
with. At first they thought they could de-
ceive the enemy by building dummy bushes
along the tracks leading to water; but the
creatures took stock of all these devices and
avoided them. So they planted themselves
in among the natural growth, disturbing it
as little as possible. “We were completely
successful, and were able to photograph
zebra and cogoni at closer range than we
had ever dreamed possible. Many pictures
were made with the subjects not moi'e than
15 yards away, showing animals feeding,
drinking and moving about with entire un-
consciousness ; what was better still, we were
able to observe their customs and obtain the
first hint of astonishing facts.”
Patience and luck are the two principal
elements in this chase. There are the long
waits in the “hide-ups,” where the art of
complete immobility has to be learned—best
from the animals themselves. “A very nice
degree of restraint is also desirable when a
particularly large and venomous snake comes
slithering towards the hide-up, bent, it
seems, on using that bush, and that alone,
for its afternoon siesta.”
A whole day’s waiting and restraint may
be lost by such a simple incident as the near-
by building of a bird’s nest. Birds are
keener-sighted than the creatures coming and
going on the forest track to their drinking-
place, and the slightest movement to turn
the handle of the cine-camera is sufficient
to set them chattering, and thus broadcast
the hunter's presence. “Filming birds at
really close quarters I have found to be,
with one or two notable exceptions, a
perfectly hopeless business.”
The opportunities for close and continuous
observation in the jungle led the 1 writer to
some interesting conclusions. Thus it is
not true that animals drink at dawn or dusk
alone; all —with the one exception of the
buffalo—drink at any time of the day when
they are thirsty. Again, it is not true that
the eyesight of the animals of the jungle—
except simians, such as the baboon —is simi-
lar to, but keener than, our own. It is
not only different from but, under certain
circumstances, quite inferior to it. Their
hearing also is not at all remarkable, and is
never acted upon alone, but only when it is
confirmed by one or more of the other senses.
The operators’ great fear when they first
attempted to shoot the animals with their
camera was that it would be not only seen
but heard —that the irrepressible whir would
give them away. In the result nothing of
the kind happened. Seemingly noise, unasso-
ciated with movement conveyed nothing. On
the other ‘hand, great reliance is placed upon
smell. Among other popular conceptions
rudely shaken was one to the effect that
practically every animal likely to be hunted
by man is so colored and marked as to make
it visible to the least possible degree. “In-
stances of animals blending with their sur-
roundings in a most curious and striking
way most certainly do occur. I think it
safe to assume they are accidental. .. . That
the coloration of animals is designedly pro-
tective is not only absurd but dead against
the weight of evidence.’

Should Artists Marry?
However it may be with cricketers, artists
should not marry.
About half the eminent artists of Europe
did not marry at all, and of those who did
very few were even moderately satisfied with
conjugal bliss.
Consider a representative collection of
those who did not. Michael Angelo, Raphael,
the eccentric Degas. Monticelli, Leonardo,
Fra Angelico and Giorgione—celibates all.
Pater dodged women. Alfred de Musset was
a victim of George Sand and absinthe. Lamb,
Stendhal, Flaubert, Merimee, Keats, Swin-
burne, Pascal and George Moore all omitted
to marry. Nor was it found necessary by
the Goncourts, Whitman, Richardson, Gray,
Ohatterton, Goldsmith, Cowper, Dowson,
James and Francis Thompson, Lionel John-
son, Chenier, Villon, Swift, Congreve, Pope,
Macaulay, Buckle, Kant, Spinoza, Adam
Smith, Herbert Spencer, Nietzsche and
Schopenhauer. Among the musicians bache-
lor’s hall was kept by Sullivan, Chopin,
Liszt, Handel, Beethoven, Schubert, Gounod
and Brahms. Nor did the poet Herrick
marry.
Of course, it is not for us to say that
better work might not have been done by
the people if they had married. But the re-
cord of the married doesn’t hold out much
hope. Balzac missed bachelordom by a few
months; everyone knows about the Carlyles;
Lytton was divorced ; Shakspeare—well!
Milton tried it three times and ended by
writing a pamphlet advocating divorce; Dry-
den made a mess of it; Burns married Lis
mistress, but w r c need not be told that he
was inconstant; Southey married and his
wife wont mad ; Coleridge lived apart from
his wife; Shelley’s record is notorious;
Wilde married; Leigh Hunt and Landor
both spoilt married life for themselves ; Ros-
setti failed after two years of it; De Quincey
muddled it badly; Hazlitt’s first wife divorced
him, his second ran away; Ruskin's marriage
was a horror; Goethe finished a mixed career
by marrying his housekeeper; Verlaine and
De Maupassant both came crashes; Byron’s
wife left him; Dumas didn’t hit it off;
Turner was a rake; Corneille fought with
his wife; Racine was a terror as a married
man ; La Fontaine left his wife early in life;
Marot used to beat his wife with loaves of
bread; Ronsard’s theories were too much for
his spouse; Zola was married, but had a
child by another, and his wife didn’t seem
to mind ; Molicre threw his wife out of the
window, and she never came back; Tasso
used to throw the furniture at his; Del
Sarto came out wrong; Renan married and
just managed to pull it off; Gorky was
thrown out of America for visiting it
with a woman not bis wife; Haupt-
mann is separated from his wife; Rousseau
had a dozen affaires and married one of them
in the end; Sterne was unhappily married ;
Dickens is well known to have failed to pull
it off properly; everyone knows the Liszt-
Wagner scandal; Bach married twice and
had 20 children. Mozart fell in love with
a girl of 15; she turned him down for an
actor, so he married another, not too success-
fully. Paderewski’s teacher, Lescliitizky,
made a habit of marrying liis prominent
pupils—ho did it five times in succession.
D’Albert did it three times. Mascagni was
not happily married. Donizetti—lie' was a
Scotsman named Izett —married an Italian
lady and changed his name; he died pf
paralysis soon after. Gluck married and
then drank himself to death.
Little more seems to be called for. The
lesson to be learned is this. Find out if
you are an artist. If you are not, marry.
If you are, avoid it like the plague.

Australian Banking, Currency and Exchange, by
H. E. Teare (Alexander Hamilton Institute). The
author is a member of this business-training body,
and has written with the student in his eye. He
therefore takes nothing for granted, and only hard
condensation has enabled him to cover so wide a
field in 300-odd pages/ There is, to begin with, a
historical sketch of currency and banking institutions,
accurate and dependable wherever the present critic
has checked it. The Australian system and methods
of banking are discussed and a comparison made
between ours and America’s. The merits and defects
of each are stated with quite judicial impartiality—
our branch-bank and overdraft systems are weighed
interestingly. Mr. Teare does not always feel called
upon to say. where, in his opinion, the weight of
evidence lies in such cases; and he is not always
convincing when he does express an opinion. Thus
it is not by any means certain that he is right in
saying, under the heading “Close Ranking Monopoly,”
that “it is still an extremely difficult matter’’ for any
new bank to get a footing. The present writer, at
any rate, would rather take his chance with a new
bank than with a new brewing co., ot daily paper
or steamship service in most Australian capitals.
Nor can the conclusion be accepted that “neither the
capital nor any part of the reserves should be
utilised, as is occasionally done, for loans to indus-
try.” That is too sweeping; how much of the
bank’s own funds may be safely lent depends mainly
upon the volume of the deposits which they have to
protect. Discussing the probable future, the author
develops the theory that Australia will inevitably
follow the U.S.A. in establishing specialised banks
for particular needs; the idea is that Australian
banks are so busy with rural interests, carrying large
risks that they cannot give productive industry the
long-term assistance it requires. Mr. Teare hasnt
proved it; but it is an interesting proposition, at
any rate.
#
“W.S.S.”: “M.G.S.” (R.P. 28/l/’26), in his per-
functory review of the Australian stage in 1925, is
liable for many sins of commission and omission.
In the first place, he refuses to give Repertory
societies a place in the discussion, not for reasons
of space, which would be pardonable, but because “a
movement appealing to a small band of dilettanti
and performed in the hothouse atmosphere of literary
coteries is not a living stage.” Even if this were
an accurate statement of the scope of the appeal of
these societies, it does not. furnish an adequate
reason for excluding them from a place in the stage
of this country. It corresponds to excluding, say,
Hilaire Belloc and Israel Zangwill from a place in
English literature because they do not run into as
many editions as Locke or Oppenheim. In trying to
discover the good plays of the year, “M.G.S. ’ com-
mences by excluding the only plays that are pro
duced solely because of their inherent goodness. The
Repertory year in Sydney was a very notable one;
and plays by Galsworthy, Shaw, Maugham, O’Neill and
others, with a popular as well as an esoteric appeal,
as the box returns of the recent season at the Palace
show, have as much right to be considered among the
plays of the year as “Mr. Petre” among the best
novels.

Studebaker—The One-Profit,
Unit-Built Car
Studebaker is a One-Profit car
because all engines, bodies, steer-
ing gear, clutches, gear boxes, dif-
ferentials, springs, axles, grey iron
castings and drop forgings are
made in Studebaker’s own fac-
tories. This eliminates the extra
profits of outside parts and body
makers and effects great savings,
which Studebaker returns to the
product in finer materials and bet-
ter workmanship.
With every vital part designed,
engineered and manufactured by
one organization, Studebaker cars
are Unit-Built and all parts are
perfectly coordinated. This in-
sures longer life, greater riding
comfort and higher resale value.
The value of Studebaker cars is
stabilized by Studebaker’s “No
pearly Models” policy.

The fine lacquer finish, genuine mohair, wool or leath-
er upholstery, the numerous body refinements—these
are obvious indications of quality which can be easily
seen on all Studebaker cars. And underneath thq
surface, the same fine quality is found.
At an expense of £120,000 a year, Studebaker ma-
chines its crankshafts on all surfaces. This explains
the smooth vibrationless operation of Studebaker
engines—a feature that adds thousands of miles to
the life of the car.
Studebaker pays a premium for steel of extra tough-
ness; it uses only fine northern ash and hard maple
wood in the body frames—no soft gum such as is cus-
tomarily used in building bodies. Doors close flush
with the body—no overlapping flange needed to hide
gaping cracks due to faulty coach work.
These are typical examples of quality beneath the
surface of Studebaker cars. They are the fruits of
One-Profit manufacture and Unit-Built construction.
Only in the highest priced cars will you find such
quality as is found throughout the Studebakefji

The Wanderer.
Out of the depths I cried
Must I walk all days
With a will that is not my own?
Proudly the horsemen ride;
And down all fair ways
Trumpets of triumph are blown.
But my feet will turn
Into strange tracks apart,
Going with no desire
On the stones that blister and burn ;
And the adders hiss at my heart
With venom of fire.
There is a gracious road
By hill and valley
Full of sunlight and shade,
Where the warm airs bear their load
Of graces that rally
Out of the scented glade.
There would I walk and sing
All the good days
From morning till night,
Feeling my heart spring,
Hager to raise
Burdens of light.
It is my heart’s way ;
It is my faith’s road ;
It is the path of fair things.
But my feet stray,
And a foolish load
My stooped shoulder brings
To cast in the wilderness
Where all is clamorous waste,
And the hot airs beat
Bringing only distress
And an evil taste
In the shame I eat.
Be guide to me, O my song!
Set my face to the sun
And the sweet of the day!
I would walk fair and strong
Where the full winds run
And the green branches play.
Lead me back liltingly wise,
Yet humble as grass,
To feel the grace
Of each green glade’s surprise
As the round hours pass
Each with a glorious face!

Were I to Die.
Were I to die now in this lovely, hour
I should not mourn the great things lmt
undone.
I should not sigh for honors left unwon,
Nor grieve that love had known so short
a power ; , ,
But still remembering the green carta s
dower,
Count out her pagan glories one by one,
Fearful that I had missed some glint of
sun, , .
Some magic from the frailest wind-blown
flower!
Then let me make more passionately mine
With every fleeting hour old friendly trees,
Grass, sky and sea —things radiant and
divine.
Let me have all the summer days can give,
Drain up their golden beauty to the lees
And soak my senses in it while I live!

Life.
God set the life of nations
In spirits such as these,
Who know the lure of red roads
And the wide waste of seas.
Lo, there are some would barter
The quiet peace of home
For the mad race of waters
And the swift swirl of foam,
For the perils of the deep sea
That the soul leaps out to meet,
Where the fierce lash of wind is
And the sharp sting of sleet!
And some would pass, uncaring
Through stress of storm and fire
And wild ways untrodden
To the strong soul’s desire —
The dim peak uprisen
On the grey wind-swept range,
The green isle uncharted
And the far lands and strange!

When stars were out and night come down
I met a girl in Oxford town.
1 met a girl of Oxford town,
Sad of heart, but merry-lipped;
And we walked up and we walked down,
Along the High we gaily tripped.
She prattled on of things she knew—-
I of the things that I might do.
She told me tales of Bagley Wood,
And primroses ungarlanded;
And then I said how sweet and good
Were sunlit sheaves when frost had fled.
And, smile to smile, we chattered till
The moon lay white upon Boar’s Hill.
And then this girl of Oxford town
Looked up and said the time was late;
And so I saw her eyes were brown,
And clasped her hand and did not wait.
And then we each went home to bed
Happier and much comforted.

WOOL AND WHEELS.
Of all Australian products none has looked
quite so firmly established as wool. The greasy
merino seemed to have its hooves dug deeply
into the good holding-ground of human need ;
, , , . ,
and as the Australian wool trade was merely
a large development of something that had
been going on tor at least five thousand
years, it looked unlikely that the demand
for the article could ever fail Pretty things
might be made m artificial silk and curiously
treated cotton ; but the solid prosperity of
the human race demanded wool. Cyrus had
worn it when he broke into Babylon; Julius
Caesar had swathed himself in a woollen
toga before going up to the fatal porch of
Pompey’s theatre; Henry VIII. had a sing-
let of the same material, and so had Siiaks-
peare; it had enabled Gladstone to face a
Midlothian winter campaign and Saraii
Bernhard to keep her voice young at 65.
What attack could possibly be made on wool?
It was the most glorious of our raw materials.
Sent away in the grease, it shouted of the
splendor of primary production over all more
intense industry. Suddenly the cable whis-
pered two hard words across the world-
“synthetic wmol.” Another cable told us that
the product was real; a third that there was
not much in it yet, but there might be later
on. Whether “synthetic wool” wipes out
the hardy merino or merely offers the world
a rival product to the thing it grows, this is
certain —wool will not maintain its ancient
place in quite the ancient manner.
* * * *
Synthetic manufactures are numerous,
and many more are promised. Beautiful
rubies can be purchased for a few shillings—
not merely good imitations, but the actual
thing. Half the female legs in Sydney and
Melbourne are at this moment clothed in
silk that never saw a silkworm. Synthetic
rubber served the Germans well during the
war and may yet threaten the practical British
monopoly of the true product. Synthetic
foods of many kinds have been tried with
some success; and though beef-steak and
mutton-chop are not seriously attacked,
chemists hint that synthetic milk will displace
Strawberry. The fact seems to be that the
whole field of primary production is likely
to be in a state of flux for a century or two
to come. The chemist cannot make bread
from stones; but as the. wheat draws its
life-giving material from the soil by, a long,
slow process fraught with a good deal of
uncertainty, it seems reasonable enough to
suppose that the chemist can draw the same
material from the same source much more
directly and swiftly and at a much lower
cost. Thus the raw material of one age may
be altogether too costly for the next; and
no one can settle down to the certainty of
drawing income from one form of primary
industry for an eternity. This was so to
some extent even in the past. An amethyst
would once have purchased a Roman estate;
to-day it might purchase one decent meal fox
a family. A little ice in the summer heat
of the Mediterranean was once worth a
king's ransom; now the ice-man brings it
in the hottest weather for a few pence. No-
body in classic times would have dreamt
that the harvest of spelt would ever cease;
to-day that once desirable cereal is produced
only in a few small corners of Europe. It
is hard to believe, though archeology fur-
nishes ample proof of it, that there was a
time in Europe when a harvest of acorns
meant bread for human beings. Gtjnding-
stones pulverised acorns and water-chestnuts
before they were tried upon barley and wheat.
To-day the world can do in a week what it
once took a hundred years to accomplish.
The changes to be expected are very many ;
and though there must always be a founda-
tion of raw materials, no one can even guess
what those raw materials wall be. Where
all is guessing, the best thing is to guess
safely as a basis for more guessing.
• * • *
The one good guess, which is really the
following of a clear inference, is that
national reliance on the production of raw
materials is dangerous. Safety lies in the
manufacturing industries which make use of
the primary products while the wares
made from them are still in demand. The
case of wool should make this clear. At
present we send most of our clip overseas
in the grease, even paying freight on the dirt
rather than pay wages to Australians to re-
move it. We also pay a number of people
to handle a portion of it" in England, pay a
manufacturer's profit on making it up, pay
various agency charges and the cost of bring-
ing it back, and then, after it lias paid duty
to re-enter Australia, put it to local use.
We are thus keeping in existence a huge
and cumbersome machine which may suddenly
be broken by the introduction of manufac-
tured articles made of synthetic wool. What
the breaking would mean is not difficult to
guess. There would be a rude financial
struggle for safety among those who
formerly depended upon our trade; and the
worst wreckage would be at our end. But
a big manufacturing trade in wool built up
in Australia could not be suddenly smashed
in the same way. Synthetic wool might
displace our products in some distant mar-
kets—though it would necessarily do so more
slowly and the battle against the new thing
would be more under our control—but our
own market is fairly large for manufactured
articles. By high duties we could guard
ourselves against importations of all kinds of
fabrics and so soften, if not entirely obviate,
the blow aimed at our trade. The same kind
of thing is true in every branch of industry.
Holding the manufacturing end of the busi-
ness as well as the production of raw
material, we could become, to a very large
extent, independent of what the rest of the
world might do—independent at least for
the time necessary to readjust our affairs.
* * * *
But as manufacturers our position would
be even better than this. The Great War
proved the ease with which one kind of factory
could be turned into another. It xvas a com-
paratively easy matter to transform a spin-
ning-plant into one for the manufacture of
gas-masks, and an iron-foundry into a place
for munition-making. Once the industries
exist, with their trained operatives and the
things necessary for making and ajtering
machinery, the whole State becomes plastic,
easily readjusted apd able to turn a hand to
almost any kind of manufacture at short
notice. Even in a wool battle we could
ourselves take up the manufacture pf the
synthetic article if such manufacture were
proved to be to opr advantage. Our jum-
bucks could be scrapped in a year, and our
pastures given over to some new form of
super-dry-farming, if the wheels were ready
to our hand to meet any emergency. But
no such easy change is possible for a people
depending on primary production. To such
a nation the change must come heavily,
bringing disaster to many, shaking the whole
basis of the community, and leaving only
doubt and poverty as a foundation for the
new order of things.
THE INITIATIVE, REFERENDUM
AND RECALL.
Dr. Maloney, M.H.R. for Melbourne, started
a House of Reps, debate on the initiative,
referendum and recall the other day, and his
remarks were characteristically enthusiastic,
though they must have been embarrassing to
Laborites of the new school. Some of them
are subjoined:—
At one time Tire Bulletin was a firm supporter
of these principles. Whether or not it has' been
influenced by the large advertisements which now
appear in its columns I cannot say, but it is no
longer as staunch a believer in the referendum,
initiative and recall as it was. The last Constitution
evolved by the genius of the British race, thanks to
the sympathy of the late King Edward and the
support of the House of Commons, namely, the Con-
stitution of Ireland, includes the initiative and
referendum. A bill providing for the referendum and
initiative lias been passed by the Tas. Leg. Assembly,
and I hope that the Leg. Council will have the good
sense to adopt it. If it does not, I hope that the
Government of that State will follow the example
of Labor Governments in Queensland and N. S.
Wales and abolish the House of Fossils.
If Dr. Maloney really believes that this
paper’s policy is influenced by advertisements,
be is welcome to whatever satisfaction the
belief may bring him. Actually, however, if this
paper had weakened on the initiative, refer-
endum and recall it wouldn’t be the big
advertiser who would be gratified—he pro-
bably doesn’t care two straws about it —but
the party of which the little doctor is a
member. Labor has no more use nowadays
for the initiative, referendum and recall than
it has for the financial independence of Aus-
tralia, which aspiration it once sought; or
for the national army and navy, based on
universal liability to service, which used to
be its pride. On the other hand, now, as
always, The Bulletin is in favor of (1)
popular initiative, because it is a means of
securing the passage of necessary laws and
constitutional amendments from which the
politicians shy; (2) the referendum, be-
cause it is a check on Parliaments which
scamp their work (as all our Parliaments
do) and pass legislation for which they
have no mandate, besides being a method of
politically educating the uniiistructed variety
of elector; and (3) the recall, because it
would arm the constituency with the power
(very necessary in these days) to get rid of
'■’a dishonest representative or one who takes
his instructions from a clique or cabal un-
known to the Constitution. Although old
hands like Maloney are still permitted to
proclaim the faith that is in them, the con-
tempt of the new-style Laborite for popular
initiative, referendum and recall is pro-
digious ; and the attempt of the little doctor
to still identify Labor with the old faith,
and to suggest that the referendum’s oppo-
nents are the “big advertisers,” amounts to
a joke.
Consider, for example, the doctor's approv-
ing reference to the Queensland Labor Gov-
ernment in this connection. In 1917, when
Queensland had a Labor Government and
two Houses of Parliament, the question of
abolishing the nominee Chamber was put to
the vote. To the utter astonishment of the
Ministry the proposal was defeated by the
greatest majority ever recorded in Queens-
land up to then—the voting was 116,196 for
abolition and 179,105 against. In spite of
this decision, which honest supporters of the
leferendum principle would have respected,
the Government had the nominee Chamber
voted out of existence by Labor members
appointed for that specific purpose by a
Labor Lieut.-Governor. It had in the mean-
time gone to the country, but abolition was
not an issue at the election nor was the Gov-
ernment’s majority such as to give it even
the. shadow of an excuse for over-riding the
referendum verdict. It was actually 23.000
votes to the bad in the constituencies, but,
the electoral boundaries being all in its
favor, it scraped back two seats to the good.
The abolitionist M’s.L.C. were rewarded with
life passes over the Queensland Government
railways, and the man who led for the. Gov-
ernment in the Upper House was retained
in the Ministry, the Labor party having
never been known to cut out a Ministerial
job or lower a tax. Further, although four
years have gone by and the same people are
on the Treasury benches, the referendum ha;
not been made a part of the Queensland
Constitution, and freak laws are passed in a
hurry by the single Chamber. The Queens-
land precedent is being closely followed by
the N.S.W. Lang Government, which is also
singled out by Dr. Maloney for praise.
Lang and co. are trying to abolish their
nominee Council by the swamping process,
and the swamping gentry are likewise to get
life passes over the N.S.W. railways and
those of such other States as may be induced
to honor them, the Abolition and Gold Pass
Bribe Bills having been introduced in the same
week. There has been, no hostile referendum
vote in N. S. Wales, but, as in Queensland,
the Labor party did not make abolition an
issue at the general election ; as in Queens-
land, moreover, it gained the smallest pos-
sible majority of seats and was a long way
behind (17.000 in this instance) its oppo-
nents’ total of votes. In ordinary circum-
stances, no democrat would lift a finger to
save a nominee Chamber. But there is
a right way and a wrong way of removing
the excrescence, and the Labor party, both
in Queensland and N. S. Wales, has taken
the wrong way. In its method of doing the
job there is neither honesty nor decency.
The whole business is more suggestive of
Tammany trickery than reform, and whether
Success or failure attends the proceedings in
N. S. Wales they will leave a vile taste in
the mouth. There have been vague promises
that the referendum will succeed the N.S.W.
Leg. Council as a constitutional brake, bur
the Queensland experience suggests that the
promises will be forgotten as soon as the
Council is no more.
* * * *
The M.H.R. for Melbourne greatly adiqires
the Irish Free State Constitution, pronounc-
ing it “the finest enjoyed by any people liv-
ing under the British flag.” He had better be
careful, for the Free State Legislature in-
cludes a Senate, and the new-style Laborite
would sweep all Senates off the face of the
earth. Moreover, the character of the Free
State Senate is even more obnoxious to the
new-style Laborite than thqt of the Aus-
tralian institution, whose destruction he
has vowed. There are 60 Free State
{Senators, the age qualification being 35 and
the term of office 12 years; and membership
js confined to citizens who “have done honor
to the nation by reason of useful public
service” or who “represent important as-
pects of the national life.” Members of
either House may demand a referendum “in
pespect of any bill other than a money bill
or bills necessary for the immediate preser-
vation of the public peace, health or safety.”
provision is made for paying them, but the
nation does not contract to give them gold
passes for the term of their natural lives —
the Constitution Act says tfyat they “may
be” furnished with “free travelling facilities”
and lets it go at that. It is odd that Irish
Free State and Australian Labor theories
of government should differ so vastly, seeing
that a large proportion of the new-style
Laborites—a majority, certainly, in N. S.
Wales and Queensland —are of Irish descent.
Perhaps the Race suffered a sea-change in
its passage to these parts.
THE ROT IN ENGLAND.
During July, August and September of last
year I was, after a long absence, revisiting
my native land. My emotions were natu-
rally stirred. The England I knew well was
the pre-war land of 1905 and earlier, with all
its gathering uncertainties as to its social
and imperial future, yet with proud 1 hopeful-
ness that all would be well because Eng-
land had always muddled through to safety
and success. The landed gentry were still
fairly safe, despite agricultural depression,
in their citadel of feudal power. London was
still the clearing-house of the world and its
financial metropolis. The fears of the land-
lords, the prosperous manufacturers and
middlemen were equally divided between the
increasing pretensions of Germany, the
iconoclasm of Lloyd George and the growth
of the Independent Labor Party. The mon-
ster of Communism was but an embryo.
The Imperial Parliament seemed to have
suffered but a slight inroad upon the respect
paid to it as a responsible and honorable
body of lawmakers.
At the beginning of July of last year there
were rumors of a great strike. For more
than two years the Miners’ Federation had
tried to obtain a living wage for its members.
It alleged that under the national agreement
of July, 1921, a living wage had not been paid.
A temporary agreement was reached reducing
the standard profits. In July the owners gave
notice to determine this agreement. This
meant either the capitulation of the miners
or a lock-out. It was another step in the
struggle for control. Transport workers and
railwaymen were pledged this time by their
leaders to rank themselves alongside the
miners. Ugly passions found expression.
Mr. Baldwin declared that the Govern-
ment would not surrender to the demands
of communists and extremists. Within a
fortnight he had succumbed to the ultimatum
presented by A. J. Cook, the secretary of the
Miners’ Federation, and pledged the national
credit to a subsidy of £10,000,000 per annum
for the continuation of the agreement
of 1924, pending a further inquiry. Mean-
time, and notwithstanding the subsidy,
orders for steel are going from Britain to
Belgium and Germany because it can be
produced there cheaper.
I spent an hour or so with Ramsay Mac-
donald and John Lawson, the financial
secretary at the War Office in the Labor
Administration. It was when the clouds
were most threatening. Macdonald is
worn, tired and reserved. He is suspect to
the great body of militant industrialists,
headed by vigorous combatants like Cook.
His influence is waning just as much as the
workers’ faith in Parliamentary action is
waning. He declared, however, that for the
mines nothing would suffice but national re-
organisation of the industry under public
ownership, with adequate safeguards for the
consumer, and participation in administra-
tion of all persons engaged in the industry.
This is the panacea of the official Labor
party. Macdonald is still a Freetrader
whose theories are enmeshed in internation-
alism. Not so Lawson, who, in, a discussion
upon the Protective laws of Australia, admit-
ted that the minds of many British Labor
men were turning in the direction of tariffs.
There was once great hope in trades union-
ism, and even timid people began to regard
it as amongst the constructive factors of
national life. That hope has been destroyed;
for in the last Congress the purpose of revo-
lutionary action was openly avowed. Such
resolutions have a most evil effect upon the
spirit of the nation. They harden opinion
amongst people of moderate minds against
the laboring classes and trade unions. There
is an intensified bitterness in the struggle
for political and economic power. There
is neither chivalry nor truth at election
times. The ground is being prepared for an
English Fascism which may lead to con-
flicts of a worse character than those in
Italy, unless the healing power of moder-
ation and sympathy can be introduced by
a great leader.
In London I visited the slum areas of
Whitechapel, Tower Hamlets, Poplar, Lime-
house, Bermondsey and Clapton. I saw
them by night and day. Twenty-years ago
I knew them, and they have not improved.
The houses and courts are as foul and sordid
as they ever were, and they are as full of
slatternly women and dirty children. There
are not so many foreigners in them, but
their suffocating squalor has increased. I
did not see their equal in Paris, Brussels,
Berlin or Rome. In towns like Birmingham
and Wolverhampton I saw long queues of
unemployed waiting to receive the dole on
which they exist. In the majority of cases
unemployment is genuine. There are, how-
ever. crowds of young malingerers who have
no desire to work, and who refuse to do so
as lopg as they can draw the dole. It is
a racial tragedy. The rhythm of national life
has been destroyed ; the great national stream
of activity has become muddied and sluggish.
Thousands are now accustomed to living
without work.
The lower middle class is disappearing: it
is being submerged by taxation and the cost
of living. It is becoming physically and
morally decadent. I found here hopeless-
ness and pessimism. They are tired of the
struggle to remain respectable and to keep
their heads above water. Some say that
England is done, and has lost her commercial
supremacy. Others bitterly criticise a Par-
liament which leaves them to the mercy of
the trade-union demands and the greed of
the middlemen. In this class the standard
of comfort has gone down. It is of all
classes the least able to protect itself.
Along with the vanishing of the lower
middle class goes the impoverishment of the
old gentry. In Shropshire, Worcestershire
and Gloucestershire I found that the old
country residences I knew had passed into
the hands of Jews, Greeks, Americans, inter-
nationalised Germans and the nouveaux


riches of Manchester, Sheffield and the Lon-
don Stock Exchange. Their code of life
moves upon principles different from the
noblesse oblige of the Old Guard. Though
eager for tlie power, they feel themselves
emancipated from the duties of their new
position in society. Their sons and daughters
practise extravagance in the gratification of
their appetites for exciting pleasures. Every-
thing and everybody seems to be running to
extremes, and the old traditions of industry
and solidity are being cast away for revolu-
tionary communism on the one side and frank
trade-avarice and self-indulgence on the other.
In spite of unemployment and of the dole,
picture-shows and public-houses flourish
amazingly. In one Saturday night at Wol-
verhampton I saw more beastly drunkenness
than I did during the whole of my three
months in France, Belgium and Italy.
Yet I know that behind all this appearance
of evil and decay there is health in the
nation. Its moral fibre is not altogether
degenerate. There are many thousands' of
cpiiet people who realise the immense stupid-
ity and suicidal tendency of extremes and of
blindness to national duties. The danger of
decay and fall is very great, but the spirit
of self-sacrifice, temperance and -charitable
sympathy is not extinct, nor is it the mon-
opoly of one class. It is difficult, however,
for such voices to be heard amongst the up-
roar of a “stunt” press, of social and re-
ligious quacks and of excited demagogues.
It is when one visits other European coun-
tries that the rot in England is so painfully
evident. France is making no great effort
to pay her foreign debts by direct taxation.
Her credit is bad and her currency depre-
ciated, yet she is hard at work, has no un-
employed, and can produce more than enough
food for her own needs. She has remained
essentially agricultural, and is self-contained.
England, on the other hand, is industrial, the
greater part of her population is in over-
crowded towns, and she is dependent for her
existence upon the importation of food.
There are few signs of want or unemploy-
ment in Belgium. Germany is rapidly re-
covering industrial power. Italy is bending
an her energies to the reconstruction of her
trade and prosperity. The potteries of Kar-
lovy Vary in Czeclio-Slovakia sire working
full time for export, whilst half the kilns
of Staffordshire are closed down because they
cannot compete with the cheap foreign pro-
ductions which now flood the markets of the
British Empire.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Digging a Grave.
If they ai’e not checked, the bosses who run
the trade-union business in Australia will
dig its grave. The apparatus begins to look
like a sort of purposeless excommunicating
machine worked by small popes of an arro-
gant sort, or like a persecuting implement
or a corporation which exists for the sake of
supporting its officers. An item in a recent
Sydney Telegraph was typical—
Several unions fear that if certain clauses of the
new Arbitration Bill are left in, the Act may prove
to be a weapon against organised labor. The matter
was earnestly debated at the A.L.P. executive meet-
ing.
Messrs W. j. Mills and Seale (Waterside
Woikers) said these clauses provided for men who
were refused membership by a union still being
to work, despite the preference clauses of
the bill.
Many men, they argued, must he refused member-
snip tor having previously proved disloyal to union
piinnples. As the hill now read, these would be
safeguarded in their jobs by the mere fact that they

It would be quaint if the mucli-prophesied
i evolution did come, and proved not to be a
rising of the Gardens and Willises, but
one directed against them —an upheaval of
nie helots who had been heloted overmuch,
the present situation looks like this. The
. Ministry invented the idea of abolish-
ing certain unions with which it isn’t pleased
ecause they are composed of men who didn’t
join in an illegal and strictly pro-Hun strike
f 00cl number of years ago. They are not

cess, but obliterated without appeal bv a
•species of Bill of Attainder. The members
will then be unemployable and sentenced to
poverty and hunger, along with their families,
unless they join another union in their own
trade, m which they will probably have as
unpleasant a time as can be arranged. But
r i/r r Proposition is now made that it
should be competent for all other unions to
retuse them admittance, so that the sentence
f v lf , ness , with poverty and hunger for
themselves and families, may be made per-

process and without possibility ot

Maoriland’s Future Millions.
° ften enter into competi-
tion with Old Moore, but Maoriland’s Stati-
S himself, in las final
report on the 1921 census, to a prophecy—
projection he prefers to call it—showing
a , V hR year 1 2000 thp Shaky Islands will
be harboring about 4.500,000 souls. The
present crow numbers about a million and
a third, and to reach the four-and-a-half-
million mark in three-quarters of a century
will mean a steady growth of population at
not very much less than the rate maintained
during the last 45 years. It may work out
like that, but the Statistician provides, along
with his prophecy, a mass of evidence that
makes his forecast look a little over-optimi-
stic. The birth-rate is'decreasing steadily,
and while immigration is being maintained
at a fair rate, there seems no guarantee
that it will continue at that rate —certainly
it will not continue undiminished if it is
regarded, in the future as in the past, as
a means of putting people “on the land.”
As far back as 1911 only 7.92 per cent, of
the area of the Dominion was available for
“selection or future disposal,” and at the
census five years ago there was but 4.22 per
cent. The Statistician himself remarks on
this point :■ —-
It is clear that the high-water mark in the rate
of land expansion has been passed. Land will yet
be available for years to come, but not in the more
generous quantities possible in earlier years. A
greater proportion of it will be of poor quality, and
lands reclaimed will be more expensive to acquire.
.... Economic development in other directions may
take the place of rural industries in encouraging and
maintaining a high rate of population increase, but
there does not seem any immediate prospect of this
taking place on a scale sufficient to offset the effect
of the diminishing area of land open to settlement.
Further, Maoriland’s population increases,
especially in recent years, have had too close
a connection with the expenditure of
borrowed money to make it safe to leave
that factor out of the calculation. In the five
years 1916-21, of 119,464 souls added to the
population 61,094 were accounted for by
Auckland province, where the bulk of public
works expenditure is allotted year after
year. The most startling expansion of popu-
lation in the whole of the Shaky Islands has
been in the town of Hamilton, centre of the
North Auckland district, which gives Maori-
land its political leaders. In 10 years there
has been a gain of 140 per cent., and what
was once a typical small country town is
now beginning to have visions of cityhood.
It is not, however, an increase of town and
city population entirely that is promoted by
railway-, road- and bridge-making in Auck-
land province. The land has been settled,
and the average area occupied by farmers is
to-day only half as large in the North Island
as in the. South. Given a period in which
the political centre of gravity should be
shifted southwards and the allocation of
loan money should follow it, the bal-
ance might be restored and the increase
of population on purely land-settlement
lines continued for many years at some-
thing approaching the present rate. If
at the same time manufacturing industries
were intelligently fostered the Statistician’s
forecast might be fulfilled. But there is no
present prospect of these things happening.
Instead, the politicians are toying with the
notion of group settlement of the British
unemployed, though they don’t really want
the unemployed half as much as they want
the spending of the subsidy from Mother.

Vineyards and Votes.
The Australian wine industry makes some
progress, but not nearly as much as it would
if the menace of prohibition were removed.
No industry can expand to any great extent
when it is liable to be blotted out without
compensation, and after surviving one costly
prohibition poll has forthwith to make elabo-
rate preparations for the next. In Westralia,
where these conditions exist, the output of
wine increased a mere 70,800 gallons in the
last five years recorded by the Commonwealth
Statistician—from 162,300 gallons to 233,100
gallons. Yet the soil and climate of South
Groperland are ideal for wine production in
vast quantities, and the Westralian dry wines
are, for the most part, excellent. A man in
the Swan Valley makes a chablis fit for a
king’s palate. A South Australian Governor,
visiting Perth, was so delighted with it that
he wrote for 20 cases to be sent to Adel-
aide. Only 10 cases arrived. In a covering
letter the winegrower explained that he had
his regular customers for all the produce of
his vineyard, and it would not be fair to
let any of them go short. He was told
he could sell a lot more chablis and hock if
he extended his operations. He might be old-
fashioned, he replied, but he didn’t see the
force of growing any more wine-grapes when
the vines might have to be grubbed up when
they reached maturity, or even before. An
Act passed in 1922 provides for a prohibition
poll to be taken in Westralia every fifth
year. The hotel landlord and licensee are
building up a compensation fund, but the
winegrower, who, with only a tithe of the
trade’s resources, has to face very severe
competition, is not in a position to follow
their example, nor has he any prospect of
being reimbursed for the possible extinction
of his business out of the Treasury. “When
a resolution of prohibition is carried,” the
Act says, “no compensation will be payable
to any person whomsoever.” So the wine-
grower limits his output, having no other
resource. What might be a really great
industry remains a small and unreasonably
burdened affair because the politicians, in
spite of American experience—and all the
indications are that the American prohibition
law will presently be amended as regards
wine and beer —go in fear of fanatics’ votes.

Australia’s Lame Telegraphs.
One of the worst checks on this country’s
internal development is its deplorable com-
munications. Telegraphically, Sydney, Mel-
bourne, Adelaide and Perth are farther away
from each other than they are from London
and New York. In other words, the foreign-
trader is more sure of getting a prompt and
accurate reply to his inquiries about imported
goods from other parts than the' Sydney
merchant has of receiving an answer to his
queries from Melbourne or Brisbane manu-
facturers. This comes about through the
fact that the Commonwealth Telegraph De-
partment, although its terminal conditions
have been vastly improved, still mainly uses
antiquated bare; wires strung on wooden poles
to join its offices. The poles are subject
to destruction by fire and ants, and the
wires become electrically as leaky as a ladder
every time a rainstorm sweeps the route or
the bough of a tree drops across them. Also,
if they blow over they cease to function alto-
gether, This would not matter so much if
repairs could always be made with decent
despatch, but days may intervene before com-
pletely normal conditions are restored. For
these reasons, among others, there is a sus-
picion that the inter-State lines are not any-
thing like 100 per cent, efficient; one expert
puts the actual work of the circuits linking
Melbourne with Sydney as low as a tenth
of their full capacity. Wireless not yet
having been found feasible as a supplementary
service between the capitals, although high
hopes have been expressed that it will enable
us to communicate with unexampled efficiencv
across the world, there remain two ways of
improving the existing service. The' best
method would probably be cables laid between
the chief centres for internal traffic, just as
they have been laid for international busi-
ness. This, however, entails a high initial
expenditure. There remains the expedient of
covering the overhead lines with insulation.
This has already been done in many cases
in England and America, and is followed
in Australia in the case of high-power trans-
mission and telephones. The cost would prob-
ably not be greater than the annual expense
of maintaining the present rickety, uncov-
ered wires—one section of the East-West line
costs £34,000 annually to keep in order —and
the electric consequences are easily stated.
One result of insulating a conductor is to
increase its retardation to the passage of
the current. This slowing-down, however,
can be counteracted by the insertion at inter-
vals of automatic relays and inductances.
The result is to make the covered wire very
little slower than the uncovered one, and the
loss in traffic capacity would more than be
made up by the fact that even if the line
blew down and lay along the ground it would
still continue to function. Another reason
why the overland telegraph-wire deserves
more consideration is the fact that recent
discoveries have enormously increased its
known possibilities of usefulness. For
instance, there will shortly be in
operation a new route between Perth
and the Eastern States. The old route
via Albany, the coast and Euela is to be
abandoned for a track that will follow the
Transcontinental railway. It will be made
of copper, and will cost £167,000. The
Eastern Extension Co. is to use it as an
addition to its new cable now being laid
between Cocos Island and Fremantle. Along
it London will speak with Melbourne and
Sydney without the interposition of human
hands. But in addition, over the same
attenuated bit of metal, John Smith, of
Footscray, will be able to exchange remarks
with William Brown, of Subiaco, in the
ordinary manner of the telephone. The
carrier-wave, a device borowed from radio,
will be the means whereby this magic will
be wrought; but if the said magic is subject
to every change in the weather, as the bare
land-lines are, nothing of great value will be
achieved, and John Smith will continue to
use the post for the interchange of views
with William Brown, just as at present.

The B.M.A.
“Carysfcrt" : Much ot the criticism of the
B.M.A. entirely misrepresents the attitude
of the parent association and of its branches
in Australia. The B.M.A. is a scientific
body, and every legally-qualified medical
practitioner, imless he has rendered
himself ineligible, can join. But, con-
trary to the. general belief, refusal or
neglect to join deprives a man of very
few privileges. A non-member can, and
indeed often does, practise alongside members,
meeting them on terms of absolute equality
as regards consultations, anaesthetics, etc.,
and is only penalised by not having a vote
at meetings, the use of the library, and a
supply of two . professional journals—which
latter lie can, if lie wishes, buy for himself.
Its prime function is to encourage research
and clinical discussions; but it has also the
function of establishing and maintaining a
standard of conduct and ethics. Its rules are
as much in the interest of the public as of
its members. A member who has been ex-
pelled, or one who has been declared ineligible
for membership, is penalised by members
refusing to meet him professionally. Thus
there is a world of difference between an
expelled or ineligible practitioner and one
who voluntarily refrains from joining. A
rule of the B.M.A. prohibits its members
from patenting any remedy, instrument, drug
or appliance, and discourages secrecy of any
kind in methods of treatment. By the early
reporting of scientific discoveries of any im-
portance the brains of hundreds of research
workers are at once employed, and the idea
worked out or discarded as valueless years
before this could be accomplished by an indi-
vidual worker. This public spirit and desire
for the co-operation of their fellows has been
the distinctive characteristic of British and
the best Continental pathologists and other
seekers after the truth, and it is the entire
lack of this spirit and the secrecy involved
that makes the profession doubt the value of
Spahlinger’s work. There is no opposition
to Spaiilinger, but experience has shown
that mucli-lauded secret formulae are usually
valueless. The attitude of the press in this
and similar instances has done harm both
to true research and to the public. With re-
gard to the publication of medical informa-
tion and the education of the public in health
matters, the attitude of the B.M.A. is definite.
It not only places no obstacles in the way of
the publication of any matter of public value
or interest, but actually encourages the spread
of medical knowledge. But it will not allow
its members to use the press as a means of
advertisement, fearing that such a practice
would lead to an undignified scramble among
the cranks and failures to acquire a practice
beyond their deserts. The result would be
bad for the public and for the more experi-
enced and better doctors who have not the
time or taste for writing. It is obvious that
the outcry of the press is actuated by the
desire for a story with the news-value inci-
dental to the association of a well-known
name, as the editors are well aware that they
can publish medical articles from acknow-
ledged authorities, and, if they so desire,
with the ukase of members of the council,
on the condition that the articles are not
signed. The lack of enthusiasm for such
articles gives the impression that the papers
desire the news-value of the name at the
fo<A rather than the subject-matter of the
article.
Mother’s Troubles.
With an army of unemployed that eats
up the substance of the realm to the tune
of well over £100,000,000 a year; with the
necessity for subsidising the coal-mining
trade by as much as £21,000,000 a year;
with the biggest armaments bill of any
nation and interest to pay on the biggest
unrepudiated debt, J. Bull is a thoughtful
man these days. Winston Churchill,
whose job it is to find a way through, over or
under the reefs that bestrew Britannia’s
course, has decided to pin his faith to depart-
mental economy and the development of
electrical power. Of the two remedies the
second is haloed by the rosiest glow of hope.
Departmental expenditure, like all other ex-
penditure on this earth, is mostly wages in
the last. analysis; and the army of sailors
and soldiers, clerks, charladies and dockyard
hands that will be dropped from Church-
ill s pay-roll is almost certain to claim a
not very much smaller State dole. But the
policy of electrification does offer certain
hard, practical advantages. Intelligently
pursued it promises to solve some of the
knottiest economic problems in connection
with coal, iron and steel, the basic industries
of Britain. It takes about 30,000,000 tons
ol coal a year to keep the iron and steel
trades of the United Kingdom going. If
these industries were put on an electrical
basis they would burn only 14,000,000 tons
of coal at an outside estimate, saving fuel
to the value, at current rates, of £14,500,000
and reducing the cost of steel by about 11s.’
per ton. Coal-mining a s at present con-
ducted in Britain is an unprofitable business,
and were it not for the threat of a social
upheaval more than half the mines now
working would be closed down. To reduce
the amouut of coal reouired, and at the same
time restore to the iron and steel trades of
Britain their old place in the world’s markets,
might reasonably be expected to bring about
a peaceful transfer of man-power from the
mines to the foundries and turn a national
loss into a profit. Britain to-day stands
seventh on the list of nations making use
of electrical power. Computed on the num-
ber of kilowatt hours used in a year, the
accepted basis of comparison, she employs
about one-fifth as much electrical power as
the United Stiites; one-fourth as much as
Canada; one-tliird as much as Germany; less
than half as much as France or Italy.’ and
only two-thirds as much as Switzerland.
VV ith a better share of cheap and efficient
electrical power Mother may be able to cope
with some of her troubles. A sensible sys-
tem of adjusting population to area within
the Empire would lop off a lot more, and
a recognition of the fact that a nation can’t
live by giving its work to other nations
would make the cure as complete as it can
be in this generation.

The Capital Removers.
Unless the Government blunders horribly
between now and Christmas, the Federal
civil servants who have just formed a com-
mittee to protect their interests in the forth-
coming trek to Canberra should have little
to complain of. There are plenty of pre-
cedents for shifting capitals. France has
done it several times; Russia did it, in
rather an untidy fashion, when the Soviet
moved camp f.'om Petrograd to Moscow; the
Indian Administration, when the wet monsoon
arrives, does it regularly every year and
thinks nothing of it. The clerk of this or
that at five o’clock on Friday shoots his cuffs
and goes to his club on the steaming coast,
and when he re-enters his office in the salu-
brious mountains on Monday morning the
letter he was last attending to is waiting
open on his desk. The migration will not be
so smooth in the Australian case, because the
authorities haven’t at their disposal a horde
of native peons; but it has at its
elbow plenty of ex-soldiers w'ho can
tell it how such things are done. They
made new capitals all over France and
Egypt and many spots in Palestine as well.
Remarkably efficient cities most of them
were, too, supplying home comforts to 10
times the multitude that will need to be
catered for at Canberra. These cities didn’t
take 26 years to prepare, and some of them
were run up overnight with enemy tear-
bombs interfering with the dignified planning
of the ornamental shrubberies and enemy
submarines interrupting the regular arrival
of supplies. Altogether the task the Federal
Government has set itself is no great shakes
of a task. Some of the conditions under
which it is erecting its new home should be
ideal. Unlike older Administrations, it doesn’t
have to tolerate slums; and it doesn’t
have to pay a million pounds compensation
to cut 30 feet off the corner of a block.
Under the Act which the three commissioners
have been empowered to interpret, the Terri-
tory soil is leased at an annual rental of
5 p.c. of its unimproved value. The lessee
is required to commence his building accord-
ing to an approved design within two years
and must complete it within three. The
usual phenomena attending settlement have
already appeared at Canberra, where at the
latest auction land for which the Government
paid a few shillings has been leased at £6
to £5B per foot in business areas and from
10s. to 645. in the suburbs. But the un-
earned increment in this case goes to the
State instead of into the hands of landlords,
mainly absentee, so that if the people’s
chosen representatives make a mull of the
business they will prove themselves disas-
trous incompetents and bring undeserved
disrepute upon a valuable principle.

Wages Without Work.
The millennial ideal of full wages without
work may be achieved in Queensland if the
Labor Government remains in office. Already
a push in that direction has been made by
the State’s biggest union, the A.W.U., which
claims a membership of 50,000. The annual
delegate meeting seriously discussed a pro-
posal to increase the sustenance allowance
payable under the Unemployed Workers’ In-
surance Act to 255. a week to single men in
the Chillagoe district, with pro rata increases
in other districts. Works Minister Kirwan,
who administers the Act, persuaded the con-
ference that “the time is not ripe” for
such a move, as the State elections are
approaching. An increased allowance for
single men, he pointed out, would involve

increases to married men, and for children.
The cost, on the basis of last year's figures,
would be £42,242. On these representations
the motion was dropped, but the conference
resolved that the period of registration should
be reduced from 14 days to seven days, that
there should be no limit to the number of
children entitled to the benefits of the Act,
and that workers should become eligible for
sustenance at 16. At present the sustenance
allowance for single workers (including
widows and widowers without children)
ranges from 15s. a week in the southern dis-
trict to 20s. a week in the northern district.
Women are eligible on the same terms as
men. The allowance for married men sup-
porting a wife ranges from 255. to 355. a
week; in addition, there is an allowance of
4s. to ss. a week for each child under 16
(not exceeding four children) wholly sup-
ported by a male or female worker. Under
this scale a northern worker with a wife
and four children draws £2 15s. a week
unemployment pay, provided this is not more
than half the award wages for his calling.
This last is a restriction which the unions
would like to see abolished. “Why should not
a man be paid full wages while unemployed?”
Other irksome restrictions confine the bene-
fits of the Act to workers who have paid
contributions for six months; they must
have been registered as unemployed for 14
days before they can draw sustenance; and
they cannot draw sustenance for more than
15 weeks in any one year, except in special
cases of hardship or distress. Works Minis-
ter Kirwan spoke of the unemployment in-
surance scheme as though it was self-
supporting. It is far from being that.
Workers pay 3d. a week each into the unem-
ployment fund; employers pay 3d. a week
in respect of each employee; and the State
contributes an equal amount by way of en-
dowment. As the State also contributes as
employer, it pays twice over. Receipts from
all sources for the year 1924-25 were:—
Workers’ contributions . . £82,889
Employers’ contributions .. 82 883
State endowment . . .. 82,819
Sundry receipts .. . . 449
Total £249,106
The disbursements were :
Sustenance payments .. . . £lBB,Oll
Administrative expenses, etc. .. 16,527
Total £204,538
That left a nominal credit balance of £44,568
on the year's operations: but, of course, that
amount, and £38,312 besides, came out of
the State endowment.

India Shows Australia the Way.
India has been giving consideration to the
“intolerable nuisance” of its army of beg-
gars ; at least, when the matter was brougnt
before its Legislative Assembly, the Govern-
ment expressed an earnest hope that members
would assist it in restricting the embarrass-
ment in some way. It was incidentally
stated that there were three million profes-
sional beggars in this dewlap of Asia; that is,
there are 16 duly authorised “religious”
beggars - leaving out of consideration the
countless millions who are all willing to
do a bit of cadging when they see the oppor-
tunity. but are still amateurs —to every 10
square miles. Australia’s total population
to 10 square miles is only 23. The Indian
Parliament’s difficulty lies in the general
local recognition of the beggar’s holiness:
he is a person who assists other people—
those who give him alms —to acquire merit;
and the more abominable an eye- and nose-
distressing nuisance he makes of himself by
self-mutilation and personal filthiness, the
more he is venerated. The Government fears
that any attempt to interfere with the in-
sanitary host would rouse a revolutionary
storm as bad as any that would result from
an interference with the caste system—the
system which, amongst its other rigid rules,
compels the sahib to employ one man to
look after his own horse and another to care
for the horse of mem-sahib. Caste and the
rights of beggars are ages old in India, and
there seems a wide gap between the wdiite
civilisation of Australia and that of the
people wdio own these prejudices ; yet Austra-
lian Labor, with its indulgence of an Unem-
ployed Union, its belief that people should
be paid for doing no work, its increasing de-
sire to secure a demarcation of jobs so that
no man may trespass on a small part of a
job for which another man might be em-
ployed, and the development of the great idea
of giving as little as possible in return for
wages, is making a good start upon the road
the people of India took centuries ago.

Last week Victoria had a concrete re-
minder that it has precious timber assets
and that hundreds of thousands of pounds’
worth of them was going up in smoke. The
pall w r as so heavy over Port Phillip that
steamers groped their way past each other
with their fog-horns. Some of the pall was
composed of the ghost of Ferntree Gully,
the showiest paradise within easy reach of
the city. Reports came in daily of fresh
outbreaks in all directions, especially in the
State forests. There was no indication in
the face of all this waste that the State
had any organisation for fire-fighting. On
one day squads of men were sent up from
the city to one centre by train, but mostly
the devastator was tackled by local volun-
teers. They were duly thanked by grateful
property-owners via the press, and a sub-
scription list has been taken up half-
heartedly ; but the notion that the question
is a national one does not seem to have pene-
trated. Instead it was disclosed that coun-
try telephone mistresses had refused to go
outside the closing regulations and transmit
urgent calls for help, and even when arrange-
ments were made to keep the bureaux open,
the postal authorities could not see their
way to forego the extra charge for after-
hour communication. The fires will be a
tragic memory in Gippsland, where, on top
of the destruction of forests, timber-mills,
farm-buildings, grass, stock and fencing,
there has been cruel loss of life. On Tuesday
28 deaths had been reported, mostly in the
Warburton district, and there were fears
that the list was not complete.

In Brisbane the other day a citizen was con-
victed for the third time of being dTunk
while driving a motor-car. He was driving
fast, too; he had hit a telegraph-pole hard
enough, after climbing on the footpath, to
smash his car. The P.M., fining the offender
£2O, regretted that he had not the power to
send him to gaol or even cancel his driver’s
license; with regard to the latter, all he
could do was to bring the matter under the
notice of the Police Commissioner. The law
is at once an anomaly and a disgrace.
HIS BUSY DAY.
“The N.S.W. Opposition leader (Mr. Bavin) last week tabled a motion of censure on the Government.
The Premier .took no notice of it and proceeded with his bills for abolishing the Leg. Council.”

THE PIRATE KING: "Not a word! Go aft! Can't you see I’m busy gettin ’ ready to

Some more loans have yet to be added, but
this is about how matters stood at June 30:

As the Queensland toiler does not work for
nothing his costs have to come out of
revenue, together with administration ex-
penses and a lot of other odds and ends, so
the amount left to pay interest on capital
has to be searched for with a microscope,
while redemption is unknown. Large, im-
ported cranes have sprouted at Gladstone
and Rockhampton, which are 308 and 276
miles respectively from the nearest con-
siderable coal measures. In addition. Rock-
hampton has one of the cranes at Broad-
mount. Bowen, 52 miles from the socialist
mine at Collinsville, eclipsed the other two
and sank just on £200,000 on a coal pier and
imported crane, being incited thereto by
visions of greatness and an estimate that
the job would cost only a little more than
half that amount. The port is now waiting
for customers and listening to the interest
climbing up. The wait is likely to be pro-
longed because, apart from the high price of
coal from the State mine, overseas cus-
tomers have developed the art of digging out
their coal from their own resources.
100,000,000 tons more being produced in
foreign countries during 1924 than 10 years
earlier. About the first ship to arrive at
Bowen for a hatful and to try the new crane
was the Royal City. But the Harbor Board
fell out with the wharf-lumpers over who was
to hook on the coal hoppers, in the midst of
which the Royal City cleared out and nobody
got the job. In these three ports there has
been spent during the last two years just on
£250,000 in appliances for loading export
coal, and if all the coal exported from Aus-
tralia, excepting N. S. Wales, during the
past 10 years (152,311 tons) could be
shipped through the three heavily involved
ports in one year, a levy of Is. Bd. per ton
would be necessary to pay 5 per cent, inter-
est on the outlay. Still, it takes a lot to
deter a Queensland politician when he makes
up his mind that a few tons of loan money
will anchor him more firmly in liis seat.

“Torres” : It is about time the Common-
wealth insisted on compulsory pilotage in
Barrier Reef waters so far as oversea ships
are concerned. The Torres Strait pilot
service is made up of master mariners, of
whom high and special qualifications are
demanded for appointment to the most tricky
pilotage in the world; but oversea navi-
gators are permitted to pilot the reef waters
without having either these qualifications or
a license. Not only the safety of passengers
is to be considered; the laws of the Com-
monwealth against smuggling aliens and
opium are stated by Northern Australians
who know to be more easily defied when the
check of the local pilot’s presence is removed.
Customs Minister Pratten should therefore
be interested—it is a matter not within State
control.

“Bildad” : In the usual makeshift way, for
this is a makeshift land, it is proposed to
put down a third rail on the Port Augusta-
Terowde section of the East-West railway
(119 J miles) so that both 3ft. Gin. and 4ft.
SAin. trains can run over it. Then the desert
express would be narrow gauge for 373 miles
from Perth to Kalgoorlie (the Westralian
Government’s promise to standardise this sec-
tion is still a dead letter), standard gauge
from Kalgoorlie to Terowie (1171 miles),
broad gauge thence to Albury (813 miles),
standard gauge across N. S. Wales and nar-
row gauge from the Queensland border to
Brisbane until the Kyogle-Brisbane line is
fixed up. But there are serious fears that the
third-rail apology may prove a death-trap
if heavy traffic tries to flee over it at more
than a walking pace, for there would be two
messes of points instead of one at busy
crossings, and only a few inches of space in
which to put the extra mess. It would pro-
bably be better to build a duplicate line.
This could be paid for out of revenue, the
money being saved by getting rid of the

any hope unless Bruce can lay a third rail
from here to London or make some other
drastic improvement.
“Griffith Moses” : On the business paper
of the Queensland Labor Political Conven-
tion were no less than 33 proposals deal-
ing with education, the most strenuous being
that there should be an end of “the exalta-
tion of monarchs and their servitors.” It
seems rather superfluous. A certain fuss is
sometimes, but not always, made over the
monarch while alive, but that is a fleeting
business. England lias made a permanent
hero and saint of Alfred, but he died 1025
years ago. It has made a minor heroine of
Elizabeth, and has also called her many
bad names. France mostly paints its
sovereigns as bad examples. Russia doesn’t
waste much admiration on its monarchs since;
Peter 1., who still commands some res'pect.
Apart from David, who was an over-rated
idol manufactured by priests of a later date,
and, in a less degree, Solomon, the Pales-
tinian rulers are mostly treated in history
worse than dogs. The language still used
on Sundays about Jeroboam, though he was
God’s anointed, and about Arab, who
apparently died in the odor of sanctity,
would justify police-court proceedings. His-
tory, as taught in the schools of the white
man’s.world, doesn’t grovel much to defunct
sovereigns, but the adulation which the IJ.S.
republican child is taught to pay to George
Washington, the wealthy, aristocratic,
military slave-owner, almost amounts to a
world’s record. Much more unpleasant is
the compulsory worship of Lenin in
the Soviet’s academies Lenin, the ; petty
aristocrat who became a military dictator,
enforced compulsory military service, was
guarded by foreign troops, and died gorged
with wealth. As for the “servitors” of
royalty, history hasn’t gone out of its way
to exalt them. Statesmen who were reputed
to hold their own with inferior and medi-
ocre rulers—men like Pitt, Bismarck and
Gladstone —may have had butter handed
to them on a lordly dish, partly on their
merits and partly because they were thought
more obnoxious to their employers than they
really were. Those who got a name, how-
ever unjustly, for being mere palace favor-
ites were damned alike. Godoy, who was a
capable and gallant patriot, and Bucking-
ham, who was a glittering fool, and Lord
North, who was a puffy and servile ass,
have had much the same bad luck, with
scores of others. But they make history
interesting, and some of them teach a lesson,
and if they were eliminated the tale xvould
tumble apart. To blot out kings and minis-
ters and wars in order that there might be
pages available for the muddy small-beer
chronicle of evanescent creatures like Gar-
den and Lang would be an affliction.

“Molokiiii” (Papua) : It isn’t quite fair to
put all the blame on the missionaries for the
assaults by natives on white women and
children which have caused the Papuan Ad-
ministration to tighten up the ordinances
dealing with such offences (B. 4/2/’2(l).
There is another cause. The population of
Port Moresby has undergone a complete
change during the last decade. Owing to
the establishment of electric light and other
conveniences, numbers of married men with
families have settled in the district. The
younger generation of white women appear
to overlook the fact that, childlike and bland
as the average Papuan servant may appear,
he is a normal male human with very
strong sex instincts. Many of them allow
their Papuan servants access to their
dressing-rooms with a freedom which would
never be offered to a white steward. The
Papuan pioneering women, realising their
danger, knew how to treat their native ser-
vants ; the increase in offences of a sexual
nature is one of the results of a change in
this regard.

“Cartot” : How t persistently Australian
universities subordinate research work to
teaching is shown by the recent complaint
of Dr. Smalpage, whose anti-tuberculosis
serum seems to offer more promise than any
of its numerous predecessors, that he could
get no aid at all from Sydney University
when he approached it for help to perfect
his discovery. A European or American
university would have been eager to place
at the disposal of the applicant extensive
laboratories and apparatus and anything else
which he required. But Sydney and Mel-
bourne University laboratories are devoted
almost exclusively to teaching work and
equipped with only the bare apparatus neces-
sary for that. The result is that during the
last 20 years Australia has contributed
little or nothing to medical discovery, al-
though much good work has been done by
Australians in other parts of the world. In
research and the addition to. human knowledge
that comes therefrom, it is surely the uni-
versities which should set the pace. Yet
ours are content to refnain little more than
technical colleges. In the present instance, had
the laboratories of the Federal Serum Insti-
tute at Royal Park, Melbourne, not been
available for Dr. Smalpage, he would prob-
ably have been forced abroad to continue
his researches.

POLITICAL
POINTS
One more hardy mendicant proposes to join
the queue outside the Federal Treasury, and
the gueue already extends round two corners.
Mines Minister Badly (who spells his name
with three superfluous letters) wants a
bonus on the production of N.S.W. copper,
which would naturally involve a bonus on
that of other States as well. It isn’t that
Australia needs more copper, which is a
drug in the world’s market just now, but
the idea is to tax Australian citizens so that
they may supply low-priced metal to foreign
citizens, in competition with sturdy and
often cheap labor rivals in a much bigger
way of business than ourselves. Common-
sense suggests that it would be better to
wait till the local demand grows or the
price rises, and concentrate meanwhile on
making our own pants.
An old and persistent acquaintance has
been at it again :
A protest has been sent to the Prime Minister by
the Australian Association of British Manufacturers,
which points out that Canadian manufacturers have
been able to build up an industry in knitted goods
which is not only capable of meeting the bulk of
the requirements of its home market, but also of
establishing an export trade, and has done this under
a 20 per cent. British preferential and 35 per cent,
general tariff.... The Association contends that en-
forcement. of the new Australian duties will prove
a hardship to British manufacturers.
The association’s contention is evidently that,
with lower duties than its new set, Austra-
lia will still be able to run the British
manufacturer of knitted wear off its market,
like Canada ; therefore, the duties should be
reduced to the Canadian level in order that
he won’t be run off the market. It is stupid,
but then Freetraders were born stupid. The
essential point is to shut out as many im-
ports as possible, whether it requires a five
or a 75 per cent, tariff. The size of the
tariff which shuts him out doesn’t matter to
the man who is properly shut out, any more
than the size of the executioner matters to
the deceased after he is dead.
Australia, with less population than Lon-
don or New York, is J. Bull’s fourth-best
customer, coming after India, the U.S. and
Germany, and running the two latter very
close. It buys over twice as much from him as
Canada does, despite the latter’s greater popu-
lation, and over three times as much as China
does, and it borrows at a frightful rate from
the Old Man, else it wouldn’t be able to pay
the bill. In fact, if it doesn’t put the plug
in hard on buying from the Old Man it is
liable to go bankrupt and ruin the Old Man.
The importer may not care, but some other
people do.
The N.S.W. railway and tramway men
who refused to join the illegal strike in
1917 have been, or are being, reduced to
their positions of eight years ago to allow
of the striker's being promoted, but so far
they have only lost status. The other day,
however, the union, acting on behalf of the
old strikers and pursuing a quenchless ani-
mosity, demanded that these men’s pay
should be cut also. Premier Lang “gave a
sympathetic reply.” Apparently the only
way the victimised men can rehabilitate
themselves, and clear their characters, and
recover lost ground, and acquire merit, is to
organise a big strike now and smash things.
Logically, the rest of the union would have
to come out also, or else fall into the con-
tempt of Lang and the disfavor of all wrong-
thinking citizens.
The Sydney press is seldom more jubilant
than when chronicling that its bloated home
town has had to let out its belt another
hole: its latest whoop is that Sydney on
the latest statistics has elbowed Glasgow
out of the position of second city in the
Empire. What isn’t even mentioned is that,
bloated as it is, Glasgow has drawn only 21 per
cent, of Scotland’s inhabitants into its net,
while Sydney has 45 per cent, of the State’s
total. At least three other cities of over
300,000 population are flourishing in Scot-
land besides Glasgow, and there are many
prosperous seaports which have not been
sacrificed to the greed and jealousy of their
big sister.
If the overseas Press “delegates” read the
brochure prepared for them by the Federal
Capital commission they must have gone
away with a poor idea of this country’s
mathematical standards. “Canberra,” says
the brochure, “is 204 miles from Sydney,
429 miles from Melbourne, 912 miles from
Adelaide, and 929 miles from Bris-
bane, from which it may be seen that
CIRCUMSTANCES ALTER CASES.
“Messrs. Walsh and Johanson are at loggerheads over the management of the Melbourne Branch of
the Seamen’s Union. Mr. Walsh complains that his colleague is acting unconstitutionally.”
THE POT: “ Heigh, Constable, Constable! Can't you see what the Kettle’s doing to me!"
the capital site is reasonably equi-distant
from the chief centres of population of the
Commonwealth.” Perth and Darwin are not
mentioned; but they are equi-distant, too.
G. A. Julius, in his presidential address
to the Institution of Engineers at Hobart
this year, makes a plea, supported by 16
graphs and large piles of statistics, for a
remission of the duties on electrical appli-
ances and machinery and the substitution
of a Federal bounty. His point is that the
Australian industry is a poor affair, mostly
a matter of “back-yard factories,” and that
the duties rob Australian power stations
of “all chance of adequate success.” In
other words, electric stoves, irons, curling-
tongs, toasters, lamps and motors are so
expensive that people can’t afford to use
them. But are they? Julius commends to
Australians the example of Maoriland where,
he says, there is “practically absolute free
trade” in these things. Yet any of the
items enumerated can be bought for less in
Sydney than in Maoriland. And that’s true
even of Christchurch, where the municipality
competes with the private traders as a pur-
veyor of all sorts of electrical goods.
Opposition-leader Charlton has dis-
coursed on the Crimes Bill. “Never before,”
he said, “had trades-union offences been
brought within the criminal law,” and he
bitterly objected to it being done now. He
wasn’t quite historically accurate, but there
was no doubt of his meaning, which was
that any crime which could be held to be
part of a strike, and which was done by
unionists on strike, or possibly not on strike
but only on stop-work meeting, should be
blameless. Charlton desired that “trades-
union leaders” should be exempt from legal
penalties except under the industrial laws,
which aren’t strong enough to deal with a
caterpillar if their past record counts for
anything.
The Commonwealth ships are still for sale,
according to Prime Minister Bruce, on the
terms that haven’t attracted, so far, an offer
of £25 for the whole show. The purchaser
is to run the ships on the conditions under
which they were losing lately close on
£600,000 a year, and he is to give a satis-
factory service and keep clear of combines
and alliances. Being tied to Australia like
a cow to a fence, he would be more com-
pletely at the mercy of local strike-makers
than even the Government is. So this coun-
try is likely to have its fleet indefinitely. It
is a pathetically small affair now, and it
can’t grow unless it loses more, for an extra
boat always means an extra loss. It is a
marvel that Bruce doesn't offer the public
debt for sale while he is in the trading mood.
Adelaide Register has raised an outcry
against recent releases of Stockade prisoners
under an enabling Act of a year ago, the
main complaint being that it was never in-
tended that sexual offenders and those guilty
of crimes of violence should be dealt with in
this way, and that the releases have been
made by the Government without public
knowledge. The reply of Chief Secretary
.Telley is that full attention has been given
to every individual case; also that each re-
lease is made on strict probation rules, and
that a man who would anyhow have been
released a few years hence, without any con-
ditions at all, is likely to be a much better
citizen through living carefully as these rules
require. It is a perfectly good argument;
the only trouble is that it might be applied
to all accused persons. Why not let them
all out on probation?
In Adelaide recently an elderly gent, who
confessed to having voted three times at the
Federal election was fined a whole £9, with
£1 Bs. 6d. costs. In Sydney a few days later
a working-man who pleaded that his religion
forbade him to take sides in politics was
fined 10s., with £2 3s. 6d. costs, for not
voting at all. The Electoral Department,
of course, prosecuted in each case, and costs
were fixed according to its representations.
It is bad enough to impose a fine for the
most flagitious of electoral offences, but to
wring heavier costs from the conscientious
non-voter than from the deliberate vote-
robber is a bureaucratic outrage.
Johanson, who shared the limelight with
Walsh but a little while ago, is learning how
fugitive a thing is “proletarian” applause.
His voyage to Melbourne to audit the books
of the Seamen’s Union, Vic. branch, was a
failure. The books were refused him, and
it was alleged that his travelling expenses
and those of two associates had been taken
from funds collected for the striking British
seamen? This charge he treated with lofty
contempt, but when the opposition went on
to assert that he had once accepted a bonus
for good or extra work done as an employee
of the Melbourne Harbor Trust his emotion
was painful to witness. No more frightful
accusation could be brought against an
“advanced” Laborite.
With his tongue in his cheek, Cuscaden,
the medico-military knight of Melbourne City
Council, suggested at the mayoral luncheon
that there should be a special session of Vic.
Parliament to legislate for the erection of
Spencer-street bridge. Acting-Premier Pea-
cock, who realises that if he were fool
enough to summon Parliament it would turn
its attention to bridge-building of quite an-
other kind, drily retorted that when* the
Mcßeath Board recommended that the Mel-
bourne Corporation should provide £240,000
of the £570,000 required for the bridge and
concomitants, Cuscaden’s crowd lost their
enthusiasm. The jar was deserved. When
anything becomes difficult in Vic. it is the
custom to run to the Government, and the
runners are urged on by the daily papers,
which later admonish the Government for
its extravagance.
Cries of “political crooks,” “thugs,”
“pimps” and “bushrangers” formed the over-
ture to the Queensland Labor Convention,
which opened with expulsions instead of
prayer. “Ned Kelly had nothing on you,”
an expelled delegate informed the chairman.
Having pushed seven protesting comrades
into the outer darkness, the survivors sang
“Solidarity for Ever,” and settled down to
business.
The Queensland Labor party has gone
back on communism to the extent of exact-
ing an anti-communist pledge from its can-
didates and delegates to party conventions
and of abandoning the idea of “a Supreme
Economic Council to control nationalised in-
dustries.” The “Council” was invented by
Lenin and Trotsky in 1918 and transferred
to the Australian Labor platform in 1921,
even the Russian terminology being copied.
Instead of aspiring to a “Soopreme Ekerno-
mie Council,” Queensland Labor is exhorted
to “cultivate Labor ideals and develop a
spirit of social service.” In view of the Gov-
ernment railway strike this will raise a
smile, but the efforts of a party whose head
has been full of foreign rubbish for years to
do a bit of thinking on its own account are
worthy of being received with thanks and
encouraged with enthusiasm.
With its abundance of raw material, fine
local market, and opportunities for working
up an export trade with Asia, Westralia
ought to be running half a dozen woollen
mills, especially as it has tariff protection
against overseas manufacturers and is shel-
tered against Eastern-States competition by
high shipping charges. Yet for want ol
Westralian customers its solitary mill —-the
one at Albany—is having a rough time.
Giving evidence before the State Prices
Commission, a representative of the biggest
business at Bunbury said: “We stock Al-
bany woollens, but we’ve only sold one pair
of trousers, although the articles are good.”
Bunbury ranks next to Kalgoorlie-Boulder
among the country towns, and is the distri-
buting centre for a populous back-country.
A lot is heard from Mann, Prowse and
Gregory, M’s.H.R., about Westralia’s
troubles, but if Westralia is satisfied to be
represented by whining Freetraders and
won’t support its own industries it deserves
to have troubles.
THE MOVING CRY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Give us a chance to go on!
It is all the world asks.
Ages on ages are gone;
They have left us their tasks
To make fair and complete.
We heard the drum beat
When nor star nor sun shone
With light for our feet—
Give us a chance to go on 1
W r e have hammered our dreams
Till with truth they might rhyme,
Smiting the red-flashing gleams
From the anvil of time.
Would you hold it as crime
That a thousand sparks shone
Like marsh fires over slime.?—
Give us a chance to go on !
Conqueror ! Conquered ! We heed not.
Let the wheels turn!
Ashes of dreams men forget
Are laid in the urn;
And there never might burn.
Where our new forges shone
Death might not return—-
Give us a chance to go on !
Only the doing is sweet
And the moving is strong;
Restless our hearts and our feet
And restless the song!
Though the ages are long,
Age cannot, smother the fire
And youth never is gone
While it cries with desire
“Give us a chance to go on!”

There was still another flurry in the office
recently: Editor Heney and manager Lan-
gan were farewelled, Cockerill of the Age
and Arthur Wynne (Watkin’s grandson)
were welcomed as editor and assistant, and
A. C. Parsons was installed in the office.
Miss Preston Stanley, M.L.A., has been given
a few acres of space to win the woman
reader, but what is to win the mere male,
and especially the male advertiser, is not
yet discernible. At to-day’s meeting it is
understood that shareholders are to be asked
to agree to a policy which will necessitate
such expenditure as will rule out the possi-
bility of divs. for at least two years. *As
they have been on a reduced diet for some
time past, and as nothing at all has been
paid for the past half-year (for the very
good reason apparently that nothing has been
earned), the sacrifice isn’t so very prodigious.
The position is miles from hopelessness. The
Telegraph has a fair circulation; it is well
established in the country, but weak in the
city. It must win more readers, particularly
near home, if it is to obtain the very profit-
able “casual” advertisement and the fat
drapers' splashes. (The new woman’s sec-
tion aims, of course, at this, but has started
off untidily.) Its competitors are the Labor
Daily, which will hold is own public so long
as it lives; the S. M. Herald, whose posi-
tion has been strengthened beyond hope of
successful attack; and the Guardian, which
has won a very substantial circulation on a
somewhat meretricious type of journalism.
It would be absurd to minimise the problem
which has to be tackled, but the D.T. is not
starting from scratch, or behind it, as the
Guardian did, nor has it sunk so low as the
Evening News had a few years back. Of
even more importance is the fact that the
Telegraph’s financial position is still won-
derfully solid. This table illustrates the
point:—

The Telegraph’s balance-sheet is free of in-
tangibles. Also its freeholds and plant are
in the books at reasonable, if not conserva-
tive, values. At present the King-street free-
hold is used uneconomically and inefficiently
for the housing of plant and staff. Pre-
sumably one of the considerations of the new
management will be the more effective utili-
sation of that valuable space. Rut in par-
ticular it wants optimism and the qualities
of youth—the things that have had most to
do with putting the Guardian where it
stands to-day.
Balance-sheet figures as at December 31
follow next:—

Being without liabilities and having its own
debt-free premises it is unusually well
placed to fight through a campaign of re-
habilitation. Its revenue-earning assets are
a help; and these include the still-profitable
World’s News. It can afford to spend
money boldly.
Though it isn’t of much importance in
view of the changes made and contemplated,
a word needs to be said about the latest
entries in the introductory table. In 1924
£5OOO was placed in taxation reserve, which
the office claimed as a true reserve. The
latest accounts show taxation reserve in-
cluded with sundry creditors; but as the
latter amounted to £6302 at December 31,
3924._ and the combined item at latest was
£7755, a certain amount of suspicion is not
unreasonable. To round off the introductory
table the £5OOO is written out of reserves.
Even then the £10,995 profit claimed by the
accounts is under the fringe of a cloud. For
one thing it was swollen by profit from the
sale _of old plant. On the other hand last
year's expenses carried £2244 ‘'retiring
allowances.”
Sales were made recently of the £1 shares
at 20s. 9d., but, at latest, sellers were seek-
ing buyers at 19s. 9d. The shares ought to
be worth about twice as much. Whether
they will be or not depends very largely upon
the showing made during the next few
months. From 1897 to 1919 capital was
built up, by bonus issues, from £50,000 to
£355,560, But if the co.’s affairs hadn’t
been mishandled it should have been easily
able to pay at least 15 p.c. on that figure,
because, after all, there is not a penn’orth
of “water” in it—all of it and more is repre-
sented bv tangible assets.

1000 c. ft.) and its intention to apply to
the Court for a higher standard price.
A year ago costs had steadied and it
looked as if consumers were to enjoy
a period of unaltered prices. But coal and
labor costs play the big parts in gas manu-
facture, and there was no escape. Total ex-
penses for the year were £265,342, or £13,405
greater than for 1924; and last year no-
thing was put aside for the depreciation
account, whereas the provision in 1924 was
£6878. At ss. 3d. per thousand under the
old working conditions the co. made barely
enough to pay the div., so the decision to
raise the price was not premature. Share-
holders, however, can take comfort from the
fact that they have an assured 8 p.c. div.
so long as the competition from electricity
does not become keener. But there is a
point beyond which a gas co. dare not raise
trices even though the Gas Act grant it the
power. Perhaps its best hope lies in the
development of the by-product business ; and
this comparison shows that good things are
happening there: —
1923. 1924. 1925.
Coal, etc £100,551 £105,560 £106,290
Taxes . . . . 6,325 7,666 8,494
All other exes. . . 107,826 108,711 120,558
Revenue from gas . . 232,981 239,093 242,672
Revenue from residuals 40,029 48,863 52023
Other revenue . . 2,818 2,916 3,140
So rapid has been the growth on the north
side of the Harbor that the co. has regu-
larly to seek new capital. Early in the
term 30,000 £1 shares were sold by auction
in accordance with the provisions of the
Act, and another 40,000 were sold last week
at prices which yielded premiums totalling
£8125, or an average of 4s. 0.7 d. per share.
At that price the return is only 6§ p.c.,
which shows that the old regard for gas-
share investments still persists. Part of the
first sum went in new workshops and offices,
but the latest amount is to meet service de-
mands. Expenditure on capital account from
3920 to 3924 averaged less than £35.000
p.a., but the amount last year was £51,261.
Less should be paid out this year now that
the new premises are completed. Inciden-
tally the co.’s claim for compensation against
the Government over the resumption of its
premises has not yet been settled. Expendi-
ture on replacement of plant was £6499 com-
pared with £BO6O in the previous year. The
fund, at. £69,145. was well below the 10 p.c.
allowed by the Act on capital and borrowed
funds (£856,075 at December 31). This
suggests that the co. never has much of a
surplus to play with.
The next table shows the need for the new
capital:—
_ , 1923. 1924. 1925.

Payment of the finad div. brought the excess
to £238,770. Fixed assets increased from
£905,849 to £957,110. Inasmuch as gas cos.
are regulated, they have nothing to gain by
price increases, unless it be the antagonism
of consumers who refuse to realise that the
responsibility generally lies outside—in this
case at the door of the N.S.W. Labor Gov-
ernment. Above all is the danger which
constantly menaces gas producers, regulated
or unregulated, that high prices for light and
fuel will speed up methods of more cheaply
purveying electricity.

It's a typical shipping eo. balance-sheet. Net
profit for the year, according to the accounts,
was £l4,9l9—“after provision had been
made for depreciation, insurance, etc.”
General reserves were £78.157 in 1924; on
Dec. 31, 1925, they were £86,656. Insurance
reserve went up £6OOO to £37,891. The
disclosed profit and these net additions to
visible reserves make up the total profit of
the introductory table. And the additions may
not represent the whole of the accumula-
tions, for the revenue written off for depre-
ciation has not been disclosed. In this
matter the co. is judged on its past. It
certainly had the habit of over-doing things
in earlier years. In 1919, for example, in
order to escape the tax-hounds, it admitted
that its actual reserves in 1914 (when the
Federal income-tax arrived) were £98,108
instead of the £18,153 disclosed by the
accounts. During the temporary setback to
the steel industry and the dry spell along
the Hunter Valley in 11922 and 1923 returns
must have been leaner, but the past two years
have compensated. As one-tliird of paid capi-
tal consists of bonus scrip issued in 1920
the 10 p.c. is a nice yield. For a long time,
however, only 6 p.c. was handed out, so old
holders deserve a little cream.
During the year the old paddle-wheeler
Namoi was sold for conversion into a hulk.
That helped to make the following altera-
tions in balance-sheet figures, and probably
also assisted in swelling the year’s profits:—
1921. 1924. 1925.
Liabilities .. .. £17,041 £17,177 £17,356

Book debts .. .. 19,000 19,522 17,867
Cash, etc 130,445 93,884 111,064
Liquids at December 31 were within £21,089
of paid capital. Deducting amounts owing
and the final div., the balance was equal to
13s. lOd. per share. The fixed assets, well
written down, are admitted to be worth an-
other £1 2s. 9d. As, moreover, the activity
at the steelworks and the growth of other
industries in the Newcastle district make
the outlook promising, the market has
notions about th" scrip, seDers asking 395.

The Mercantile and General Insur-
ance Co., Ltd. (M.L.) : The arrival
of this co. in November, 1922, was
not nearly so flamboyant as that of
most of the youngsters which saw the light
in the Commonwealth a little earlier. “Sup-
port Dominion enterprise” was a valuable
scrip-selling slogan, and the fact that over
a million and a half is paid annually by
Dominion insurers to British and foreign cos.
was used with effect. Also, as the co. has
power to carry on finance business, the pros-
pectus declared that a portion of the co.’s
funds would “probably be used to assist
shareholders to acquire homes.” As usual,
the rich, old-established cos. were quoted
to show the profits that were to be won.
The promoter and the flotation syndicate
took 13,900 shares; 1500 fully-paid shares
(£1) to the promoter, 12,400 fully-paid shares
to the flotation syndicate. Also, “£6200, or
such part thereof as is expended [amount
unspecified in the two annual reports],
advanced by the syndicate, to be repaid by
the co.” The loading was not light, although
the value of the preliminary work may be
evident later. More than 20.000 shares were
taken up by the promoters, according to the
revised prospectus, and the directors agreed
to accept shares in lieu of the cash repay-
ment.
Unforeseen difficulties lurked around the
first corner. About 70,000 shares had been
sold when the Registrar stepped in and re-
fused registration, holding that such a co.
was not entitled to do Accident business.
Rather than indulge in “troublesome litiga-
tion,” the directors started all over again.
It was decided to deal with Fire and Marine
only, pending a settlement of the co.’s appli-
cation to the Courts for the right to accept
Accident business. This saved time, for a
decision was not arrived at until January 28
last, when the Chief Justice made an order
in the co/s favor.
In the prospectus it was “confidently an-
ticipated that not more than (Is. per share
will be called up.” By the first balance
(May, 1924) 209,150 shares had been allotted
for cash on which Bs. per share had been
called (£8617 was in arrears and £6O had
been paid in advance). The Board con-
sidered the subscribed capital sufficient for
immediate requirements and placed a pre-
mium of 2s. 6d. on further issues. In the
latest accounts (14 months to July, 1925)
capital figured at £106,057 in 14.000 shares
fully-paid; 230,130 paid to Bs.; 550 paid to
65.; with £l6O calls unpaid. In the 1924
accounts, in addition to promoters’ considera-
tion of £13,900, preliminary exes, were in at
£1 0,446. As at July 31 last the entries were
consolidated, £1639 was written off the item,
but an additional £lOOO swelled the amount
to £28,727. Share premiums reserve was
£1473; forfeited shares reserve £939; and
reserve for unexpired risks £2131. Opera-
tions for the 14 months resulted in a loss of
£0712, raised to £8843 on making the cus-
tomary 40 p.c. provision for unexpired risks.
The office points out that £2220 of expenses
was really part of the expenditure incurred
during the flotation period. The net result,
however, is that 31 p.c. of the co.’s capital
has disappeared, for the time being at least.
Much greater business will have to be written
at much less cost_ if the co. is to make head-
way. Last year’s net premium income of
£5329 was won at a cost of £15,546, an im-
possible rate, even allowing that £2220 did
not belong to the period. The fact that
the whole of the Accident writings during
the period—profitable business generally—
had to be reinsured affects the position,' of
course, and now that the co. has won the
right to do that class of business, last
year's results cannot be used as a yard-
stick wherewith to measure the co.’s future.
Losses (28.7 p.c.) were not heavy; but manv
of the policies had not run for a full year.
Assets are of fair quality; public securities,
cash and interest account for £42,665; lease-
hold. £12.122; mortgages, £20,582 • with
sundry debtors and office and field' equip-
ment in at £4939, a total of £SO.3OS. Credi-
tor items amounted to £7278. Policies are
well protected, but shareholders will have to
do some waiting.

The public is interested in the prefs.
Accounts don’t afford a clear indication of
the position owing to the grouping of free-
hold and leasehold with stocks on the one
side, and the inclusion of depreciation with
the reserves. While reserves in the intro-
tiuctory table are shown less the goodwill
(£18,949), lacking information as to the
amount for depreciation they must be viewed
doubtfully. Stocks should be shown sepa-
rately. The only other assets entry (apart
from goodwill) is “sundry debtors, pre-
IP\ypi°P ts ’ cash .»t bank and on hand,
£73,)7.’ That mixture is less important only
because it is smaller. The freeholds-stock
baa die ( £ 15 6, 271 ) was £22,103 greater than
Ui ] . t p s the co. is making big building
additions it is impossible to say what that
increase represented. “Net profit on trading,
after providing for working expenses, depre-
ciation and taxation” was £13,921 for 1924
and £13,810 last year, the unexplained addi-
tions to reserves on this occasion being less.
In view of the greater capital (£8919 in-
crease) . and the prosperity which was re-
flected in most retailers’ accounts for the
same period, that merited a word of expla-
nation. The co.’s business may have suf-
fered from disorganisation due to the re-
building activities. The directors merely
remark that the “state and condition of the
co. is satisfactory.” Sundry creditors and
loans _ were slightly heavier at £19,505, but
that is relatively unimportant. Even with
the qualification as to reserves prefs. are well
secured; the full £30,000 calls for only £2400
p.a.

The consistent maintenance of its full capacity is
one of the many recommendations that influence" the
use of Pioneer Wood Pipe. When first installed it
will carry from 15 to 20 per cent, more fluid than
any metal pipe, and this flow will increase instead of
decrease as the years go by. The reason for this is
that the interior bore becomes smoother with the
friction of the constant flow. This smoothness pre-
vents the accumulation of organic growths or similar
obstructions, and rust is, of course, unknown. The

Profits increased slightly, and the Board
swooped on them for an extra \ p.c. That
left only £623 to go to reserves. These seem
substantial enough at £52,674. But, like the
capital, they are in plant, property and stock;
and, as those assets can earn hardly a fair
return on capital alone, the reserves aren’t
worth considering. The outlook seems to be
without promise; shareholders nowadays are
satisfied so long as there is enough left to
pay them 7 or 8 p.c. after works, mains
and machinery have been kept in the “high
state of efficiency” which the annual report
always claims. Plydraulic power has been
kicked to the side of the road by electricity;
and only a few uses give it an excuse to keep
on the highway at all. Fortunately, work-
ing costs ai'e held in hand:—

But that surplus is less taxation provision
(£1500) and the final div. (£4800) ; allow-
ing for corresponding deductions, the position
is a bit weaker than it was in 1924. The
position in this respect, as well as the real
profit, is governed mainly by the amount
necessary to provide for renewals and re-
pairs. The extra | p.c. has not impressed
the market, which offers 13s. 6d. for the £1
shares and 6s. 6d. for the contribs. (12s.
paid).

Sydney Speedway, Ltd., is the latest offer-
ing to the god of speed. Capital is £lOO,OOO
in £5O shares —1000 for public subscription,
100 to the vendor as consideration for options
secured and work done, and 900 reserved.
The vendor’s cut seems out of proportion. It
is proposed to purchase 300 acres at Black-
town, 21 miles from Sydney, and construct
a speedway, “one of the largest in the world.”
According to the prospectus the track will be
almost two miles long and will permit of
record speed-making. Details are given as
to the treatment of grounds and track for
safety and comfort of competitors and
patrons. Mention is made of attendances at
Newcastle and Maroubra speedways ; and it is
declared that, “allowing for only 24 meet-
ings yearly, the estimated return on capital
employed is 40 p.c. p.a.” There is no expert
estimate of constructional costs or expendi-
ture. No valuation of the land is given nor is
its price stated. The prospectus is hopelessly
incomplete on essential points, and investors
are likely to fight shy of the proposition until
these figures are forthcoming.
Condobolin G. M. Co. (N.S.W.) in 400,000
2s. shares is on the market. The prospectus
states that the co. “will take over from the
Marshall-Longton Lucknow Co. the option
on mining lease No. 1707, at Melrose-road,
Coiidobolin.” All of which means that the
peg on which some irresponsible folk hung an
Aladdin’s Lamp at Lucknow a year ago has
been shifted to Condobolin. This is further
emphasised by the statement that “there
shall be 100,000 subscribing shares available
for preferential applications from holders in
the Marshall-Longton Co. for 14 days, after
which time all subscribing shares unapplied
for shall be open for public subscription.”
Of the 400,000 shares half go to the vendors
fully paid to 25., and the balance will be let
out to applicants. Bill Longton is the mine
manager, and he attests that the main shaft
is down 30ft. on a 25-acre lease and that
the lode can be traced for over 600 ft. and is
from 16 to 20 feet wide. Longton sees over
10,000 tons from 20ft. to the surface, and
finds a resemblance to Mt. Boppy stone: 12
tons treated at the old Lucknow battery gave

dence is given by Duncan Marshall and by

The Petroleum Products Bill, recently
sent to the Senate, will result in the follow-
ing allocations from the £60,000 that is
to be made available on a £ for £ basis:
£22,500 to a co. at Crisis Creek (W.A.) ;
£22,500 to the Hunter River Oil Co. to pros-
pect the Belford dome (N.S.W.) for coal,
oil and gas; £5OOO to subsidise S.A. oil-
drilling cos.; and the rest of Australia may
struggle for the balance of £lO,OOO. Queens-
land is sure to get some of it, and Tas. and
Vic. can toss a penny for what’s left.

There is a faint echo of the 1893 bank
smash in the voluntary liquidation, now in
progress, of the Excelsior Land, Investment
and Building Co. and Bank, Ltd. Born in
Sydney about 1880, selling land, lending
money and banking occupied the co.’s time
till the crisis. Then the banking end of the
enterprise fell off, and a quiet and lucrative
business in the other lines followed for over
30 years. A large slice of Leichhardt was
one of its big subdivisions, and streets still
wear the names of the co.’s early directors —
Cary, Day, Reuss, Thornley, Jarrett, etc.
A big city hotel, recently sold, was part of
the co.’s assets.
B. H. South is hard at work on its new
shaft. Development quite regularly proves
fresh ore. In the Zinc Corp.’s mine, next
door, developments are equally good; and
as this show rejoices iii comparatively, low
costs and high recoveries, it stands about on
a par with the South to-day from the point of
view of profits.
The “Big Mine” at Broken Hill, although
not able to justify its title these days, is
just now turning in a fair bit of ore from
Block 10 —enough to make John Braiidon
wonder why they sold it for £BOOO.
* * * +
Apart from the water-famine, things at the
B. H. Central look much more hopeful;
mining operations are being slowly extended.
Fire and water have made a sad mess of
the Sulphide Corporation’s wonderful old
property, but high metal prices, if they hold,
will make amends. Meanwhile dump treat-
ment and the Junction output keep the pot
boiling. Some good ore is being got from
the Junction from old workings.
Disgruntled Perth shareholders have put
a “Please explain” to the Mararoa manage-
ment. The estimate of ore reserves given
at the recent meeting was 30,000 tons worth
435. Cost of treatment with a properly
equipped plant, it was stated, would not ex-
ceed 30s. Does this, it is asked, mean
that the present plant is obsolete; or • does
it want adding to? If the latter, what is
likely to be the cost? The management is
reminded that quite recently it said that the
mine would pay its way in future. The
market thinks otherwise; shares are hard
to sell at a few pence.

It appears that Boulder Perseverance’s
Is. div. paid on January 27 applied only
to the 400,000 priority shares issued during
the co.’s last financial year and held under
three years’ option by the guarantors of the
700,000 priority shares issued in August,
1923. The priority shares were entitled
to a pref. div. of 100 p.c., or Is. per share,
on payment of which all shares in the co.
ranke/1 alike. Divs. aggregating Is. were
paid on the originally issued priority shares
between August, 1923, and January, 1925.
Perth is booming a new gold find iii the
s.-e. corner of the Yalgoo field, which, it
is alleged, has not previously been pros-
pected. Stone broken from an ironstone
formation close -to the rabbit-proof fence is
said to have assayed 30dwt., and other rock
napped near by is reckoned to be quite as
good.
Jock Thomson has brought more good news
to Perth from distant Braeside silver-lead-
field (W.A.). Good finds are said to have
been made at 60ft. down, and Thomson is
much impressed with prospects. Last year
geologist Blatchford inspected Braeside on
behalf of the Government and reported that
the outcrops were continuous for miles and
contained in places up to 80 per cent. lead.
For the present, however, high cost of pro-
duction is scaring capital away from the
field.
Westralian Development Trust has been
formed in Perth, and 100.000 of its 250,000
ss. shares are to be issued right away. The
co. is purely local, and its objective is
“legitimate mining and commercial enter-
prise.” In the case of a mining venture
showing favorable results, a subsidiary co.,
in which the trust will hold a controlling
interest, will be formed to purchase, develop
and equip the proposition. There seems to
be a good opening for it.

It was a lucky day for Associated Gold
Mines (W.A.) when it acquired interests in
Canada. One of its ventures —the Iveeley—
has been the sensation of Canadian silver-
mining of the past two years. It is now
paying 24 p.c. p.a. in divs. plus bonuses. At
the meeting of shareholders in Toronto a
few months ago chairman Mackintosh Bell
predicted that the property would have a long
profit-earning existence. The other venture
—Vipond Consols —produced over half a
million dollars’ worth of gold last year, and
the first div. is expected shortly. Ore re-
serves are estimated at a quarter of a million
tons of 9Udollar ore aud liquid assets are
250,000 dollars. Encouraged by Associated’s
success, Associated Northern Co. recently
acquired an interest in the Canadian Lorrain
silver-mine, which is said to have a six-inch,
vein containing 6000 oz. of silver to the ton
and 6ft. of payable rock. A plant is in course
of erection. On the whole, shareholders in
the now liquidated Associated Co. haven’t
done badly. Up to 1914 they received, in
addition to 275. 6d. per share in divs., inter-
ests in Associated Northern, Lake View
South, Lake View Extended and Keeley.
These distributions were followed by profitless
years until 1924, when divs. were received
from the Iveeley; and last year further cash
and shares were handed out when two new
cos. were formed, one to acquire the old co.’s
Westralian interests and the other to take
over its Canadian assets.

“Mackeroo” on a “dry” mine township:—
The proposed model township and welfare scheme
at Wiluna will not be the first of its kind in W.A.
At Kajarra, near Meekathari-a, a mining co. erected,
in addition to married-men’s homes, a canteen and
hostel, which it leased at Is. a head to lodgers.
But the miners refused these advantages and instead
built humpies for themselves along the creek. This
ungraciousness was provoked by the co. declaring
its ground a prohibition area, and refusing employ-
ment and accommodation to those who refused to
abstain from the currrsed derrink. Many attributed
the subsequent failure of mining operations to the
using up of most of the capital on “surface dressing,”
leaving insufficient for proper sinking.

Victoria’s gold yield continues to fall. For
3925 the output was 47,2960 z. fine (valued
at £200,958), 19.8710 z. below the quantity
won in 1924. Thirty years ago the yield was
800,000 oz. a year. Most of what quartz and
alluvial is left cannot stand the strain of
present wages.
The Sardine, at Kangaroo Hill (N.Q.),
a clear run, should eclipse past records
during the current half-year. It has started
with a crushing of 50 tons for 15 tons of
concentrates, which at the present price of
tin makes the ore worth £52 a ton. Last
half-year 84 tons of concentrates were won,
as a result of hitting the new shoot, which
more than quadrupled the paltry IS tons of
the previous half. This shoot shows a length
of from 55ft. to 130 ft. of ore in the stopes
between No. 1 and No. 4 levels, the lode vary-
ing from 18in to sft. in thickness. Owing
to the high price of tin it looks as if share-
holders will fare even better than they did
out of the first shoot, which enabled the co.
to pay £32.000 in dividends in the course of
two and a half years. The directors are
building a reserve fund for future prospect-
ing work along the lode channel and have
acquired extra leases on the south continua-
tion of it. The lean time the mine had after
the first shoot was finished taught them a
lesson.
* * * *
The prospects of Brookfield, near Brisbane,
turning out a payable goldfield have faded
and the few prospectors in the old workings
are having a lean time. The last geological
report was extremely pessimistic. Although
a few assays showed 500 z., gold extracted
has not been sufficient to pay for the plant
put up—a plant, by the way, which tried
very indifferent crushing and amalgamation
on an ore that didn’t carry free gold. Apart
from the poor size of the reef and the shoots
this treatment didn’t give it a show.

A Cairns (N.Q.) deputation, interested in
the commercial possibilities of cheap power
to be derived from harnessing the Barron,
interviewed the Minister for Mines mi liis
recent northern visit, urging the mining in-
terest in such a scheme. The possibilities
of zinc production and treatment were put
forward, provided cheap power could be
made available, principally because it is no-
torious that nearly every silver-lead mine in
the Cairns hinterland carries zinc, which is
thrown on the dump or goes up the flues
at the Chillagoe smelters. Crude zmc ores
have been exported during the past year to
Europe, but only a little from the richest
shoots. The Minister promised a general
investigation of the possible sources of
supply in the hinterland, wherefore Geol-
ogist Morton was sent to the district to
tot up probable and possible supplies. If
favorable the report will be used as an extra
link in the chain to pull off Cairns s _ pet
liydro-electric power scheme, with the idea
of having a concentrating plant and later a
separation, unit near Mareeba or Cairns.
Dr. Jensen has frequently drawn attention
in the past to the zinc potentialities of the
Cairns district. 8.11. people sent a scout
to Mt. Garnet and Mungana zinc shows
last year to see what they looked like, but
the report was not enthusiastic enough for
the cos. which are making piles of money
at the Barrier.
W. F. Lee. manager of the Macdonnell
Ranges mica show (N.T.) , continues pegging
leases. Another 40-acre mica block is men-
tioned, also “a 40-acre mineral lease at Arl-
tunga, containing gold, silver and lead; also
a new gold lease carrying lOoz. per ton.” He
has 14 men at work deepening the three
shafts and opening up at other points. The
25cwt. of mica ready for packing varies from
4in. x 4in. to lOin. x lOin.

the high opinion of Dr. H. I. Jensen. Major
Dudley, chief of the N.T. police, after q. trip
to the field, gave corroborative evidence on
returning to Darwin. Engineer Stewart,
however, got caught in the wet season and
is held up with the crushing plant at 'the
Fitzroy River —which means that the date
of production remains indefinite.
Kuala Lumpur (F.M.S.) made the re-
spectable profit of £62,043 for the year from
treatment of 784,565 yards of 1.67-lb. ground
for a yield of 587 tons oxide. At September,
1924, the figures were 806,925 yards of half-
pound ground, which showed £21,305 profit.
The co. paid 3s. 9d. in four quarterlies,
which absorbed £31,312 of the available
£63,227. Preliminary exes, and sundries
claimed £4386, and £27,528 remained over
against £llB3 brought in. Creditors
amounted to £7493, and the co. held £30,063
in Government stock, £9463 in cash and
£6395 in book debts. The balance of 180
acres of the Tanjong Malim rubber estate,
adjoining the area being worked, will be
taken over at the option price of £lB,BOO.
Although the boring revealed very erratic
values, the directors “believe that the whole
area can be operated at a profit.” As most
of the new ground is under rubber ready for
tapping, it should yield good revenue while
rubber prices keep up. The total area now
held is 823 acres, of which 600 acres have
been worked out, leaving 223 acres yet
available for treatment.

thrills enough to satisfy the hungriest
stomach. The latest story that has drifted
into Charleville from the Queensland Far-
ther Out started on December 16, when a
well-sinker on Yeolola, near Beeehal station,
100 miles the other side of Cheepie, had a
bucket of rocks precipitated on him, causing
serious injury. Five inches of rain having
lately fallen, the telephone was out of order
and the Beeehal Creek in flood. One of the

and Superintendent Grimstead, of the Char-

tion of emulating the feats of Leander, Cap-

When the other reveller awoke from a doze

and grief he took his mate’s belongings to

“FY7”: I cannot certify that Bourbon-
street, Bundaberg, is the widest in Australia
(B. 4/2/’26), but I can quote an unso-
licited testimonial. About two o’clock one
moonlit winter’s morning in the long ago a
party of footballers from Brisbane tacked
across the thoroughfare's wide expanses on
their way to their hotel from a “banquet.”
They had nearly crossed in safety, when
there were sounds of distress behind. A
hurriedly organised patrol returned to find

ously. “No,” he said, “I won’ go any fur-

“Old Wig”: At the Melbourne Sessions
Judge Woinarski met a seaman aged 42 years
in whom the love ardor was in full flower.
He was serving a sentence, but a small thing
like that couldn’t stop him. Eventually,
however, one of his letters fell into the
wrong hands, and then there was trouble.
He pleaded guilty, but counsel appeared to
make an impassioned address on his behalf —
his client had spent the long months of his
imprisonment in preparing the ground for
a reformed life fertilised with brave endeavor,
and so on. It was fine, but it cut no ice
with ’sHonor. “I find,” said he, “that you
were engaged in an illicit and most improper
correspondence with an unfortunate girl who
lives over the border in New South Wales
and who had never seen you in her
life. You wrote to her that you were a
naval officer confined for having struck a
superior officer. You never let her know you
were a criminal. You wrote to her as one
of the League of Lonely Hearts. Only that
the thing was discovered, one does not know
how it might hate finished.” The Judge then
made it 12 mon,ths, and there is a vacancy
in the League of Lonely Injured Innocents.
“Percy Pawnticket” : The Sydney Seamen’s
Home, now being re-built, has some interest-

pants were the

swain was John

established in ISGO,
and for years had
a somewhat dismal
attachment in the
Morgue; official-

“Harold Hardupp”: Sydney land values
continue to soar, especially in the neighbor-
hood of what will be the St. James’s city-rail-
way station. The latest piece of earth to
change hands is a block on the corner of Mar-
ket and Castlereagli streets, having a 176 ft.
frontage along the former street, with a depth
of 118 ft., and Mauri Bros, and Thomson’s
building with a 64ft. front to Castlereagli-
street. The deal takes in the old Cambridge
Hotel, and the total purchase price was
£4oo,ooo—nea rly £2300 per frontage foot,
whichever way the frontage is considered,
and something like £l4 per square foot. Most
of the land belongs to the estate of the late
John Ritchie, of Parramatta; 30 years ago
the possibilities of this part of the city were
so little realised that the shop-rents (includ-
ing the upper storeys of the buildings) were
but £2 per week. But several fortunes have

“Milly Soak”: Australia has been the
scene of many racial quarrels imported from
outside; one of the most ineradicable ven-
dettas was that maintained on the W.A.
gOk/nelds when camel transport was boom-
ing. The Asiatics who owned and loaded and
drove the beasts were either Afghans or
Beloochis, and the antipathy between them
was extraordinarily bitter. Men of one
nationality would not work for or with those
of another, so the two kept rigidly apart,
and mostly gave each other a wide berth on
the roads. But occasionally there were col-
lisions in the back country. The most not-
able of these occurred somewhere near
Wiluna over 20 years ago. An Afghan
camel train encountered a Beloochi one, each
more than usually embittered by trade jeal-
ousies atop of national hatreds, and the con-
sideration that there were no white police
within a hundred miles probably helped both
sides to decide that it was an ideal place
for a scrap. Some trivial dispute about the
rule of the road w r as an excellent peg for the
declaration of hostilities, there was an abund-
ance of saplings and stones handy, and the
patient camels accommodatingly pulled up
while the rival clans waded into one another
with all the fury of Douglases and Percys
in the old border days. It is doubtful whether
anyone was killed, but several of the com-
batants were badly knocked about before the
battered forces drew off and went their ways.
No prosecutions were instituted by the police,
largely because no white man saw the fight
or could say why it started or how it ended,
-but the heads of the two warring clans im-
mediately came down to Perth, where each
hired the most expensive K.C. he could get
to sue the other fellow for damages. They
carried the case up to the Supreme Court,
too, although nobody got anything out of it
except the lawyers and interpreters.

“Kir”: In a N.S.W. up-country town,
where a lady storekeeper and a 60-year-old
wheat cocky, both previously wedded, are
about to re-embark upon the sea of matri-
mony, a curious mix-up of relationships will
eventuate. The prospective bride's eldest
daughter is married to the about-to-be hus-
band’s son; consequently the latter couple
will shortly become step-brother and step-
sister, while remaining husband and wife.
Said husband will also acquire a step-
mother who is already his mother-in-law,
while his wife’s father-in-law becomes her
step-father. The neighbors for miles around
are busy working out complications that
are still in the lap of the future.

“Cartot” : Federal Government offices are
festooned with red tape. An inspector of
the Postal Department visiting a Queensland
country district found that two tanks be-
longing do the local post-office were no
longer required; furthermore, he found a
buyer for them at £6 on the spot. He paid
in the money at the nearest receiving office
for the Federal Treasury, adding the usual
memo. A few days later came a communi-
cation from headquarters drawing attention
to the fact that all Government property
before being sold must be advertised in the
local papers and directing that this course
be followed with the tanks. So the inspector
had to return the money, get back the tanks,
advertise their sale and engage an auctioneer
to sell them, with the result that the original
buyer, the only bidder, obtained them for
255. And out of that the cost of the ad-
vertisement and the auctioneer’s fee had to
be deducted.

girls were known to travel with the equiva-
lent of sixpence packed in a hat. At school
the excuse for lateness, “Please, miss, I had
t’ wait till the man took me rats,” began to
be disturbingly common, and when the depots
became so rushed that late-eomers were
asked to return in the evening, worse trouble
started. From every side came complaints
about defunct rodents in bags and baskets,
in cars, trains and school-desks, all carefully

cherished by their possessors until such time
as the capitation money could be collected,
and the mere sight of a small boy in street
and ’bus would cause the over-fussy portion
of the public to sheer off. Things came to
a head when an unsympathetic master took
up a collection of dead rats in his school,
and suggested that the bubonic plague itself
might be a lesser evil. His strenuous atti-
tude ended the sixpenny bonus, and the rat,
no longer a financial asset, was left to mul-
tiply in peace.

bumped another car. A fortnight ago, steer-
ing peacefully home, I rammed one which
had pulled up suddenly, making a bad casu-
alty of the mudguard. After much argument
we went on, each convinced that the other
was the culprit. Yesterday, again steering
peacefully home, my brakes played a trick
and I ran slap into the rear of a car which
was correctly standing at a tram-stop. When
we bundled out, the bumper full of apologies
and the bumpee full of righteous indignation,
we both burst into laughter—it was the same
driver and the same car!
“Centurion” : Surprise has been expressed
in London, according to the cableman, be-
cause the pipers of the band of
the Scots Guards were permitted
to attend the memorial service
in Trafalgar-square to Charles
I. The idea is, apparently, that
the presence of the troops is a
slight on the present Royal
family. Actually, the House of
Windsor is itself a branch of
the Stuart tree, as old Queen
Victoria was most particular to
insist, though the connection is
on the distaff side, and thus
acquired its roundabout right to
the throne of Britain which
Parliament afterwards con-
firmed. Even the most exclusive
royalty cannot fairly object to
its soldiers attending a memo-
rial service to its own ances-
tor. Further, the bands of
the Household Regiments,
like those of the rest of
the forces, are available for hire,
under certain conditions, and
make a lot of money for regi-
mental and other funds. There
is nothing to prevent the White
Rose Society, the Oak Apple
Society, or any other of the
numerous Jacobite organisations
which lead a loyal and blameless existence
in Britain, from hiring one of them.
“Grif.-Moses”: The U.S. authorities have
refused to admit, as a casual visitor, the
Countess of Catlicart, because she once
eloped with the Earl of Craven, the result
being that her husband divorced her. They
reckon her a demoralising influence and a
bold, bad woman. For its population the
U.S. lias 17 times as many divorces as Eng-
land, and if the separated Yanks and
Yankesses were banned abroad there would be
a fearsome slump in travel. A wide impres-
sion prevails that all U.S. people bar G.
Washington and A. Lincoln were, or are,
divorced, and, anyhow, 297,108 more of them
entered the unmarried state in 1922, which
was considerable. The Earl of Craven, who
brought about the lady’s downfall, is living
in the U.S., but perhaps the fact that he
owns 40,000 acres makes a difference. The
injurious differentiation recalls how a barris-
ter broke into song in the days when Justice
Butt worked the divorce machine in London :
Ought the man to be cut as well as the lady?
When they’ve met Justice Butt ought the man to
be cut ?
When they’ve stuck in a rut down a lane that is
shady
Ought the man to be cut as well as the lady ?
“Ex-Dig.”: The message “passed along”
when it was unsafe to do more than whisper
it was invariably mutilated. Going in to the
line below Wyschaete, we used a track where
the snow had been trodden hard, and feet
occasionally clicked noisily on the ice. The
O.C. turned and whispered: “Pass back the
word: ‘Smother that noise. Tread on the
side softly.’ ” At our next halt there was
a flurry along the ranks as the sergeant
from the rear pushed his way forward deter-
minedly. “If you're using a code,” lie
panted, in a whisper, “why wasn’t I told
about it? What’s the meaning of ‘Mother-in-
law’s dead on the side sofa’?”

“Te Babarantiko”: Many years have
passed without any serious marine dis-
aster occurring at Ocean Island; but
now W. Crosby and Co.'s steamer Ooma is
reported aground on Sydney Point, the east-
ern extremity of Home Bay, where the phos-
phate shipping settlement Ooma and the
native village Uma sit in palm groves on the
only level sandy spot on the rugged little
island. In the early days of the island’s
phosphate industry there were several sudden
mishaps. First the Elba went on shore in
Home Bay. Except for some of the derricks,
there was no chance of salvage before the
ship slipped off the reef and sank. Next, on
a dark evening in 1906, the Norwegian
steamer Inger, moored to the deepsea buoy
with a thousand tons of phosphate in her
holds, unexpectedly found herself on the rocks
almost alongside the Stump jetty. The
captain was about to signal his engine to
start and the mate was ready to let slip the
mooring bridle, when the main mooring span
parted : the weight of the inshore spans did
the rest. As a hat on a peg, she hung a day
or so on the pinnacles before sliding down
the steep base of the island and disappearing.
All that ever came to the surface was a
hatch. A spectacular incident occurred when
the exhausted oarsmen in a boat from the
Norwegian steamer Promise, under charter
to the Pacific Phosphate Co., were drifting
into the breakers on Sydney Point. The cap-
tain’s wife was in the boat. Taking a
desperate chance, the captain ran his ship
over the shallows, skirting the outer breakers
so close that water splashed on board, and
in passing picked up his imperilled boat.

“Joph”: One of the Sydney newspapers
in its account of the recent bush-fires in the
Canberra district announced that “the capital
was in grave danger,” and drew a moving;
picture of fire-fighters lying exhausted by the
roadside. As a matter of fact the main fire
never came within 10 miles of the city area.
A smaller fire broke out some four miles
away, but was quickly subdued. The city
area is almost treeless, consisting chiefly of
an undulating plain covered by a short stub-
ble of dry grass, which, even if deliberately
lighted, would burn itself out without caus-
ing damage.

“Sixenate” : Two queer juggles, with the
spirit of the First Offenders Act have been
brought off within the last week or so. A
man convicted of bigamy was let off as a
first offender, on the principle, apparently,
that everybody should be allowed to marry
twice at least once. The other case was
that of a 55-year-old male fortune-teller who
admitted that he had been convicted IS
years before for the same illegality, and
again more recently, but asked to be
treated as a first offender as he “had never
been released as a first offender before.”
That fine point so touched the magistrate
that he let the charlatan go on bond.
“Feng-Shui”: Has anybody considered the
risks of the present fashionable craze for
importing those handsome and intelligent
canines known as Alsatians? First cousins
to the European wolf, they have the same
attraction for sensation-loving women as
those other dangerous pets, the Malayan bear
and the waw-waw. As a cub, the Malayan
bear is a charming companion, but if he is
not sent back to his native jungle before
his claws grow too exuberant, a lacerated
baby may be the penalty. If a few Alsatians
take to the wilderness and there mate with
the dingo, Australia will at last have a
specimen of the dangerous carnivora to
tempt sportsmen hitherward.

“Machete”; That matter of missing M’s.P.
(B. 4/2/’26) recalls an almost parallel hap-
pening in Queensland years ago. The van-
ished legislator was sorely needed in the
House, but all efforts to locate him had
failed until a cabman delivered a note from
file missing man to the cashier of a city
journal for which the M.L.A. did a good deal
of free-lance work. The missive contained a
request that any money due be sent by the
bearer. As the amount was about £2O.
and the address given was not exactly

hurriedly consulting the manager, compro-
mised by sending £5, adding a word of warn-

BESIDE THE CYPRESS PINE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Someone has lost a handkerchief
That bears a woven “A" ;
I found it and a fading rose
Within the bush to day.
It’s bordered with a silken fringe
Of amber lace and fine;
It lay all crumpled on the sand
Beside the cypress pine.
They rested where the shadows fell
Late in the afternoon,
And where the hill might shade the light
Shed by a waning moon.
All torn and trampled was the grass
And crushed were leaf and spine,
And there were footprints in the sand
Beneath the cypress pine.
The cypress pine grows on a hill
Long miles from anywhere;
No habitation is in sight—
A bush track leads you there.
No thorn is on the fading rose
(Dark red as blood is red)
That nestles on a frond of fern
Bound by a plaited thread.
They kept in step along the track
Until they reached the pine;
One shoe was small with pointed toe,
The other big as mine.
But by the tree they crissed and crossed
And when they issued forth
Broad soles went out toward the soutb,
And pointed toes went north.
The frond of fern is withering,
And drooping is the rose,
Its fragrant petals yet as red
As reddest blood that flows.
The little handkerchief is soiled
With morning dew—or tears.
A breeze croons through the cypress pine
As it has crooned for years.

W. 11. Collyer, 'ji graduate in engineering
of Melbourne University, is home on fur-
lough from Singapore. In Singapore he was
deputy-chairman of the Improvement Trust,
created to battle with the appalling conditions
a century of unrestricted Asiatic immigra-
tion has made of Australia's future first line
of defence. Lodginjg-houses with a frontage
of 30ft. run back
250 ft. without any
light or ventilation
but the front and
rear doors. Up-
wards of 700 human
termites will live in
such an antheap at
a nightly rental of
10 cents for the
space to spread
their insanitary

augmented by
nearly 100,000 fresh

Federal Reps.
Although it was Sandford wiio pioneered
the Lithgow ironworks, it was Charles
Hoskins who made them successful. Sand-
ford liked to be popular with his men and
to be called a “good boss,” and his employees
showed their appreciation by making work
a pleasure. One of their little pleasantries
was for half a gang to slip away for a
little game of cards while the other half,
which would later be relieved for the same
serious purpose, carried on. When, with
the backing of the Commercial Bank, Hos-
kins Bros, took over the bankrupt concern
they changed all that. The men were in-
clined to kick, but the best of them soon
found in the new boss a man who was pre-
pared to pay very handsomely for real work.
Charles Hoskins, who died last Sunday,
made such a success of the works that he
was a millionaire when he retired 18 months
ago. A hard school gave him his training.
An orphan at the age of 13, he had to go
to work as a mailboy, but trained himself
as an engineer’s turner, and presently started
with his brothers the engineering firm of
Hoskins Bros. George retired a few years
ago. Charles was 75 at his death. It is
to their credit that they brightened dear old
Sandford's declining years with a gift of
£50,000.
Archbishop Kelly had his 76th birthday-
party on the 13th of this month. Born in
Waterford, he spent the earlier years of his
ministry as a missioner up and down the dis-
tressful country, till he became rector of the
Irish College in Rome. When Leo XIII.
decided it was a fair thing for Cardinal
Moran to have an assistant, Dr. Kelly, who
was persona grata with the Pontiff, got the
job practically unopposed. Morbidly careful
of his health he resents any insinuation that
he is failing, and is punctilious in attention
to his manifold duties. He is now in resi-
dence at the Blue Sisters’ Hospital at Lewis-
ham (Sydney), and attends the Cathedral
for a few hours daily. His disappointment
at the delay in getting St. Mary’s Cathedral
free from debt and opened has been tempered
somewhat by the decision to hold the Inter-
national Eucharistic Conference of 1928 in
Sydney. If the shekels have rolled in suf-
ficiently the cathedral will then be opened.
At present the wages-sheet is about £3OOO
per month, as it has been for years.
The Commonwealth Historic Memorials
Committee has just decided to make a start on
the National Gallery at Canberra by getting
portraits of explorer Sturt, surveyor T. L.
Mitchell, botanist Joseph Banks, statesman
W. C. Wentworth and poet Henry Kendall.
Lord Forster by Longstaff and W. M.
Hughes by Norman Carter are also to be
hung. Mention of W. M. Hughes recalls
the occasion when he was being painted by
Augustus John in Paris. It was a grey
day, the affairs of the world were looking
grey, and John was dipping his brush into
liquid mud and making a grey likeness of the
then Priminister. Billy stood it for a while
and then burst out with an infuriated
inquiry as to whether the artist took him for
a monkey. John seized his palette knife
and savagely cut the canvas to shreds. It
took several days and a lunch under the
auspioes of Bertram Mackennal to heal the
breach.
Rua, the “Maori Prophet” who, as a mis-
sionary of the spirit, acquired a big follow-
ing. has turned up again as a missionary of
plain grog. Fined £65 for selling liquor to
Maoris, he not only cheerfully paid up, hut
undertook to shoulder a considerable liability
for fines inflicted upon others who suffered
with him :
Though his mana this may kill
And sceptics prompt to scoff, it’s

Arnold Ferry, lately dead in Adelaide,
did not look his 58 years. His father,
locally known as “the Master,” is still an
active veteran ; in the days when he had a
racing string, specially strong in jumpers,
Arnold and his brother Sydney (who has
lately been made a stipendiary steward for
S.A. Jockey Club) rode them all. Arnold,
who started at about five stone, was so re-
markably successful as an amateur that he
was practically forced into taking out a
jockey’s license. lie made several journeys
to India, and won a lot of races there.
After breaking a leg, he took up veterinary
work, and for the last 20 years has had a
good practice.
James Butcher, of Bullatliana and other
north-west stations in W.A., believes in
getting things done. For years past Govern-
ments have been promising a new road from
Carnarvon to Perth, which would lessen the
distance to the capital by at least a hundred
miles, the existing road being in the shape of
two sides of a triangle. Disgusted at the
delays Butcher engaged a fleet of motor-
trucks, a team of surveyors and a gang of
men. Having footed the bill he handed the
road over to the roads boards concerned.
Except for a few bends, to correct errors of
survey, it runs as straight as a gun-
barrel for 96 miles. Every 30 miles along
the track there is a fireproof galvanised-iron
catchment shed equipped with two 4000-
gallon tanks, and in addition to this there is
a 30-gallon drum of water every 10 miles.
It is to be doubted whether there is a longer
straight track cut by one man’s private
enterprise in the world.
Joe Ward’s prophecy of an approaching
financial stringency that will make Maori-
land very sorry for itself is backed up by
Harold Beauchamp. That venerable bank
chairman estimates that the Shaky Isles
have “lost” 12 millions in the last year
through the decline in prices for meat, wool
and butter. But Beauchamp’s prognostica-
tions are always a bit on the gloomy side
and he has a keen appetite for woe. A few
years ago the cableman made a mistake
in the quotation of English Consols, and
newspapers that knew nothing and cared
less about Consols recorded a substantial
drop since the preceding week. The Welling-
ton Times thought such a fall peculiar
and sent a reporter round to ask Beauchamp
about it, the result being the publication of
an interview in which the interviewee said
he had been expecting the catastrophe for
weeks and pointed out why it was inevitable.
After four or five months’ relentless pur-
suit of “Irish-exile” book-material in Tas-
mania, Mrs. Sydney Ball, whose late hus-
band was an Oxford don, has returned to
the mainland. Her search led her into all
sorts of out-of-the-way places in the Speck,
each of which added something to the boot-
trunk full of manuscript which the elderly
but observant lady is taking away to Oxford
by an early steamer. A long interview with
Daniel Burke, who helped Michell to escape
from Van Diemen's Land, is among the items
labelled priceless by the authoress. “Danny,”
who recently retired (nominally) from Tas-
manian political and municipal activity, is
close on his century, and the Oxford pen-
woman (who is Irish-born) declares that
every day and in every way his memory is
getting better and better, or words to that
effect.
GEORGE BELL, one of Melbourne’s best
brush wielders and assistant-instructor
at the National Gallery Art School.
Squatterdom in Vic. is mourning for John
Moffat, squire of Chatswortli House, in the
most fertile portion of the wealthy western
district. He inherited large slices of the
Cabbage Garden, and, like his dad, special-
ised in merino-sheep raising. Chatswortli
House, the spacious pile which fascinated the
Duke of Edinburgh in ’67, came to Moffat
in ’79, when he was a stripling of 24, so he
had a fairly long innings as its lord. His
home paddocks, with the Hopkins River
running through them, totted up to 18,060
acres.
Yet another aspirant for the laurels after
which Spahlinger and Smalpage are striving
is De Luca, of Innisfail (N.Q.). This Italian
doctor, Australianised by 15 years of resi-
dence, is a graduate of Naples and Con-
stantinople, and took post-graduate courses
in Paris and Genoa. He lias been making
practical use of his method of tuberculosis
treatment for 12 years. There is no secret
about his methods. Antigen, in combination
with albuminoid ferments, is administered,
and there are subsequent intra-muscular in-
jections of fermented lipoids extracted from
animals refractory to t.b. Essentially it is
a serum treatment, and, like Spahlinger and
Smalpage, De Luca gets his serum from
horses. It takes two or three months to
prepare the serum, and De Luca reckons that
a cure can be effected in three months.
After spending a lifetime juggling with
figures, George Handley Kuibbs quits his
job as Director of the Commonwealth
Bureau of Science and Industry next month.
His term finishes then, and, as he will be
68 in June and is suffering from ill-health,
he has put in his resignation by way of
indicating that he does not want a renewal.
Born in Sydney, Knibbs started life in the
N.S.W. Lands Survey, and sat in many
official places before he became Common-
wealth Statistician. He held that job from
1906 until he took over his latest appoint-
ment. With his tremendously wide know-
ledge and capacity for research he made a
great success of “The Commonwealth Year
Book”; but his passion for vast calculations
probably did Australia a bad turn when he
was set to work to produce formulas for
arriving at Commonwealth land and other
taxes. He relaxed into poetry sometimes, and
has published two books of verse, but he
was better at figures.
W hen and if Captain G. H. Wilkins hops
off on his flight to the North Pole, he will be
undertaking liis second venture into the
Arctic. The first occupied four years, be-
tween 1913 and 1917, when he was second in
command of Stefansson’s party. That exploit
followed experiences as a photographic
correspondent with the Turkish troops in
the Balkan War, when his “close-ups” of
fighting startled the world. Coming out of
the ice to discover that a war was on, he
enlisted without delay, did some fighting in
the air, and then became the A.I.F. official
photographer. He invited death time and
time again when he got out over No Man’s
Land to take front views of liops-over. The
Armistice Day joybells had hardly stopped
ringing before lie came flying over Australia
from Britain in the Blackburn-Kangaroo
plane. Before the cheers had died down
he was besieging the South Pole as second-
in-command of the 1920 British Antarctic
expedition. Now America has an adventure
to offer, and Wilkins, who has crowded so
many into his 37 years, is not the man to
let an adventure go begging. He is an Adel-
aide boy, and went through the Adelaide
"School of Mines.
George M. Dash, the pushful Queenslander
who is expected to succeed Percy Hunter as
Director of Migration, has had a varied
career in which every job has been made a
stepping-stone to a better one. He was an
insurance agent and a journalist with Labor
leanings before the war; then he became a
recruiting officer and political organiser for
the Queensland Nationalists before emerging
into general Australian notice as organiser
of Commonwealth War and peace loans. In
Brisbane he runs a Sunday paper and acts as
chairman of Wren’s racing club.
“P. Pawnticket”: Old Jacob Mandelbcrg
is one of the tenants on the Sydney corner
for which a syndicate has just paid £300,000;
and he will probably have a word or two
to say before he flies before the demolishers.
“Old Jacob” proved the most stubborn of pas-
sive resisters when the contractors for the
David Jones building tried to shift him from
the opposite corner, where he had been estab-
lished for a life-time. Even when the build-
ings all around him had been demolished,
and the ground at the back was being dug
for foundations, Jacob continued to accommo-
date his clients; he only caved in when the
wreckers started to take the roof from over
his head. The queer old man, who is very
charitable though a hard bargainer, tells ot
how he lately sold an engagement-ring to a
young man whose father and grandfather had
in their day made similar purchases fro :n
him.
The cable quivered with excitement when
it carried a message about the “mystery
absence” of Admiral Guy Gaunt, who is a
member of the British House of Commons.
It subsequently turned out that the chair-
man of the Conservative Party knew exactly
where Gaunt was, and that there was no
mystery. Coming to Australia last May.
the wanderlust seized Gaunt, and, after a
good long look at the land where he was born,
he went to Hongkong, where he hired a small
schooner for a saunter amongst the islands.
There would be the pull of old memories in
such a trip. Gaunt was a lieutenant on the
Swift in operations in the Philippines in
1897, and in the trouble in Samoa, two years
later, he raised Gaunt’s Brigade for the
protection of British interests. The Vice-
Admiral is one of the four children of Vic-
torian Judge Gaunt who have gained dis-
tinction. The eldest, Cecil, saw service with
the British Army in India, South Africa
and Mesopotamia. Ernest is also a vice-
admiral (he was rear-admiral command-
ing the first battle squadron at Jutland) ;
and Mary Gaunt made her mark as a novel-
ist. Guy, the youngest of the sons, is 57.
Captain Frederick Allenby, the Field-Mar-
shal’s young brother and heir (B. 28/l/’26),

An almost whiskerless institution is the
N.S.YV. Assembly. The Labor members in
that Chamber constitute a particularly bare-
faced crowd. Andy Lysaght, the elongated
Wollongong lawyer, the unchallengeable
veteran of the team, is the only one to wear a
beard, while in addition to the Premier, Bill
Holdswortli, the East Sydney publican, and
Pat Minalian alone affect moustaches. The rest
of the party rigidly eschew facial adornment
of any description, the most recent convert
to the clean-shaven ranks being Alderman
Mick Burke. Among the remaining members
of the House are merely six with moustaches
—Bennett, Scott Fell, Fitzpatrick, Fuller,
Kilpatrick and Missingliam—and two < mild
sets of whiskers, Wearne’s and Hoskins’s.

And Schelly's naetamorphosised
With'but a consonant excised
And just a vowel admitted.
By shady rocks he feeds his flocks
And folds them in for sleep;
The chaff they get is Moscow-made,
At Marxian trotighs their thirst’s allayed
Those poor deluded sheep !
With wage plugs’ feet he longs to beat

“The Rumpus” : A friend of mine in Perth
suffered dreadfully from chronic diarrhoea and gradu-
ally wasted to skin and bone. One day his wife
suggested that he should take a train-ride to Cottes-
loe and. lie on. the. sand. To please her he did so.
Near the water’s edge he started raking the loose
white sand with his fingei’s and brought up a bleached
cuttle-fish shell. With his finger-nail he began scrap-
ing the soft portion and experienced a craving to
taste the shell-powder. Trying and liking it, he
swallowed a quantity. Within a week he felt his
complaint slackening, and a month later was free of
it. Although quite healthy ever since, he makes
periodical pilgrimages to the beach to gather cuttle-
fish shell.

“Jean S.” (Eng.) : Can any Abo.-ite tell
me how to cure a mare of founder? She contracted
it after heavy galloping in a fresh paddock and
then being out on a particularly cold night. She
is afflicted in the forefeet only, being very lame
some days and stiff in action. I have tried blister-
ing and placing her in a clay swamp without success.
The local vet. says I may as well send her to the
pack any time, as a horse with founder never com-
pletely recovers. If no good Australian stockman
can tell me what to do, then I’ll know it’s hopeless.
* * * *
“J.T.D.” : “Mephisto” is evidently serious
regarding the plunging of a wet hand into molten
lead without harm resulting (B. 28/l/’26). He is
emphatic in his assertion that an explosion is im-
possible. Well, I have been working in a foundry
33 years, and still have charge of one in the hind-
quarters of Tiie Bulletin Office, where “Mephisto,”
if he looks in, can be satisfied. M ater, molten lead
and ambulance provided.

“The Station Nurse”: After many fruit-
less efforts to rid the station of crows in the lamb-
ing season, I tried the following plan. I pinned
a wounded son of Satan on his back with extended
wings and awaited events. Pretty soon a couple
of his brethren inspected the strange sight an !
hastened to broadcast the news. Within quarter of
an hour there were 400 crows circling and sweeping
above the spot, but just out of rifle-range. Mounted,
and armed with my gun, I headed the mob for Bourke.
Riding on the wings of the column, I directed its
flight by an occasional shot. As far as I know, those
birds are still on the wing. At least they haven't
reappeared.
* * * *
“Wart”: A nurse, shepherding some kids
away from the water at a picnic, told me of how
she had been gravely informed by a five-year-old that
he couldn’t be drowned because he had a caul over
his face when he was bofn. His mother, questioned.
endorsed the statement
and added that any
sailor would confirm
the fact. I asked the
oldest salt of my
acquaintance, and he
professed a firm belief
in the superstition. He
said that there were
various degrees of
protection, according
to whether you wore
your own caul, one
belonging to a blood
relation or merely a
stranger's. In the
first case you could not
possibly be drowned,
in the second only
while an east wind
was blowing, and in
the third Davy Jones
had various loopholes
to get you through.
There was a time, he
told me, w 7 hen almost
every right-thinking
sailor wore a caul, or
what he had bought
for one, in a canvas
bag slung round his
neck. An ordinary
caul cost 55., but one
from the face of a
seventh son was worth
ten guineas. A Jew in
Whitechapel did a
roaring trade in those
mascots until an in-
quisitive sailor split
open the canvas bag
and found nothing in-
side of it. Thencefor-
ward, when a sailor who was known to have worn a
caul was drowned, his shipmates would remark that
it must have been a “Jew’s caul.”
* * * «
“Sylvester”: “Wanchai” (B. 21/l/’26)
writes of the size and viciousness of the nettles at
Orbost (Vic.). I have had experience of the old
bush-nettle of the South Coast, N.S.W.; also of the
broad-leaf nettle, a scrub tree that grew to a fairly
large size and possessed a sting to be remembered.
On the Northern Rivers there is also a narrow-leafed
nettle growing in the scrub, but I have never seen
it reach the tree stage. Some persons state that its
sting is more severe than that of the broad leaf.
But it is in the Gympie district (Q.) I met the
king of the nettle tribe. It is known as the Gympie
and grows in the soft-wood scrubs into a large shrub
with a broad leaf. I once got a severe stinging
from it on the wrist and was kept awake until mid-
night with a throbbing pain under the armpit. For
nearly six months the arm would smart whenever
it was dipped in water, especially on cold mornings.
“S.D.”: In the early ’eighties my two
brothers and I were on Mount Nor’-West station, back
from Farina (S f .A.), carrying out a contract for
fencing. The aboriginals were fairly numerous in
this part, and we had our share, and used to treat
them kindly and feed them well. One of their number
A SILLY QUESTION TO ASK A MAN.
WEARY: “You think wives should be paid wages?”
BEERY: “Of course I do. What do you think I send mine out washing for?"
named Toby brought the bullocks into camp early
every morning, and he and his gin always received
a good breakfast for this. Suddenly Toby and his
family disappeared from the camp, and were away
three months. They turned up again, and without
a word Toby took up his old job of bullock-hunting.
“Where you bin sit down, Toby?” “Longa mission-
ary,” replied Toby. “How you likem missionary,
Toby?” I asked. “No likem; too mucha yabber
‘daily bread,’ and no givem,” said Toby promptly.
* * * *
“Hayband”: A Seven Hills (N.S.W.)
poultry farmer has an effective method of protecting
his fowl-runs. The yards form an oblong. At each
corner and midway at the sides stands a post—six in
all. On the ground, loosely encircling the posts,
lies a wire along which slips a steel ring. Attached
to the ring is a dog-chain with a bulldog at the
other end of it. The slight slackness of the wire
enables him to get right round the enclosure, and
anyone trying to steal that man’s fowls would think
he had struck a bulldog merry-go-round.
“Dor Jong”: Lord Apsley, the sprig of
British nobility who hit Australia incog, and secured
employment with a cocky a couple of years ago
in order to familiarise himself with
the conditions for immigration, has
been eulogising Australians for
“gradually giving up barbed-wire
fencing in favor of plain steel wire
strained through hardwood posts”;
incidentally, he gives the unoffending
Boer farmer an undeserved back-
hander for being “the first to put
barbarous bai'Ded-wire into general
• use.” In both instances the noble
lord is talking through his coronet.
Ninety-five per cent, or more of Aus-
tralian fencing, from Cape York to
the Leeuwin, is, and always has
been, of plain wire. Up to a few
years ago the Boer used little fenc-
ing of any description other than
stone walls, shepnerding all his
stock, and what barbed-wire was used
was in the Cape and Natal, and in
British communities at that. It
was introduced there by American
drummers, who brought the vile
stuff from the country which in-
vented it and uses more of it for
fencing material than all the rest of
the world combined. Now that
South African stock-breeders have
begun to fence as a regular thing,
the Australian influence is seen in
the general preference for plain wire.
“Swiss”: Re “Jim Carew’s” 60-year-old
demijohn of whisky—-why, before a decent fraction of
that period had passed there would remain not even
a spirituous whiff to tell the tale of a distinguished
occupation. Whisky will get away from an earthen-
ware vessel, be it never so tightly corked. Glass
is the only gaol it can’t escape from.
"Parama”: One moonlight night off the
New Guinea coast the “boy” at the tiller told me
that “father b’long Biama he finish altogedder.”
Listening carefully I made out the faint booming
notes of a conch shell, that wireless of the islands,
blown from somewhere along the almost invisible
coast; and a moment later Biama, my best diving
“boy,” came aft and told me that his father had
just died. “More better we go ’shore, boss, you
please, and see that old man b’lor.g me, t’ank you
ver’ much.” We ran in to within half a mile of
the village, and Biama was put ashore in the dinghy.
I followed next morning, and witnessed the funeral.
The deceased was laid out on the mat on which he
had died; his bow and favorite stick were beside
him, and on his chest his pipe and a small supply
of tobacco and sago. Biama and the rest of the
family were squatting around the corpse mourning
loudly. Then the body and things, having been rolled
tightly in the mat and tied up, were laid in
a hole some 2ft. deep that had been scooped in
the sand about 50ft. from the hut. The sand was
hand-shovelled back, and the grave filled in; a palm-
leaf torch was stuck upright in the middle of it,
with two firesticks and some punkwood beside it —
this with the idea that fire and light should be
all ready for him when “that feller b’long him walk
’bout again.” The entire population of the village
THE TEST.
MR. ISSACS: “You want to marriage mine daughter , eh!
— vell, could you lend me three thousan’ poun 's
for twelve weeks mitout security?”
MR. JACOBS ( readily): “Vhy, most cerdainly I could, Mr.
Issacs. But I couldn't.”
MR. ISSACS: “Take her, mine son.”
retired to their huts before dark that evening, and
remained there, with doors and openings closed and
fastened to keep the spirit of the dead man out
during the night. Next day the death feast was
held. In some cases a palm-leaf roof is erected
over the grave to form a spirit house, which is left
there for one moon, after which the relatives have
another feast and the shelter is removed, the spirit
by that time having “gone west.”

JOHNNY JACKEROO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Oh, he wasn’t liked at first till we found he had a
thirst
An’ was square enough to share it with the mob!
He was clean an’ young an’ white an’ his trousers
was a sight—
“ Mister Bent” because his father was a nob.
He said “Jove!” instead of “Gripes!”; he smoked
fags instead of pipes;
He was awf’ly jolly careful of his shirt.
But he took it off one day, shaped his dukes an’
said his say;
An’ he laid the station slushy in the dirt.
Sing a song o’ grafters —
Pound a week an’ keep —
Lucky (Gawd, he’s lucky!)
Gettin’ any sleep.
Pluggin’ out at daylight,
Same as me and you,
Draggin’ home at nightfall —
Johnny Jaekeroo!
He was raw an’ green, of course, an’ he’d never
seen a horse—
He could drive a flamin’ motor like a swell—
But he’d ride the roughest prad that the station
ever had
An’ he didn’t care a tinker if he fell.
If he tripped agin his spurs, somersaulted in the
burrs,
Well, his language wouldn’t shift a sleepy hearse:
But before he’d stayed a year it was “Blanky blank,
old dear!”
An’ we learnt a lot a-listening to him curse.
Hasn’t got a union,
Ticket or award;
Fourteen hours, an’ twenty
Shillin’s an’ his board!
If the cow is calvin’,
If the mail is due—
“ Where the hell is Johnny,
Johnny Jaekeroo ?”
OLD DAYS RECALLED.
STRANGER : “ I’m sorry, old man, I’ve only got the price of a pint
for myself.”
DIGGER: “Moll, how about making the supreme sacrifice?”
So we learnt the cow to cuss, liked an’ made him one
of us,
Took an’ smoked his cigarettes all along the
tracks;
He looked lady-like an’ tame, but inside him he
was game
An’ he never ran us down behind our backs.
Oh, we called him “Mister Bent,” but he jerried
what we meant!
He was just the cove to tell our troubles to ;
An’ wherever he is gone I may meet him later on,
For there’s cobbers worse than Johnny Jaekeroo!
Sing a song o’ grafters,
Pound a week an’ keep!
Lucky (Gawd, he’s lucky!')
Gettin’ any sleep.
Pluggin’ out at daylight,
Same as me and you —
Hogan’s Ghost, he’s dinkum —
Johnny Jaekeroo!

{ppp Bao-rd Wa-fio^'s)
“Zulu”: The Fijian thrower cited by
“Vuniwai” (B. 14/l/’26) misses the mark by two
yards. The abo record of 140 yards made by King
Billy of Clermont (Q.) -was established in 1872 and
again in 1873. The world’s record of 140 yards
2 feet was made by R. Pereival in 1884, the feat
being performed on the Durham Sands racecourse;
and a throw of 140 yards 9 inches made at Toronto
in 1572 stands to the credit of Ross Mackenzie.
THE REAL WORRY.
PRISON VISITOR: “I suppose you, bitterly regret the past?"
COUNTERFEITER: “No charnce! It’s what didn’t pass that
worries me."
“FY7” : There is no doubt, as “Shoveller”
says (B. 21/l/’26), that our first rabbit families
settled in Australia long before the days of Collison
or Thatcher, rival claimants to the honor of their
introduction. The curious thing about it is the
failure of the early colonies to establish themselves
under conditions which later on proved ideal. Tn
the ’fifties my mother was a girl on a station under
the Bunya Mountains, on the Darling Downs. Some
of the Scottish immigrants who acted as shepherds
had brought rabbits with them, and these had
increased their number, burrowing about the home-
stead, and many of them living in an immense
woodheap close behind the kitchen. Though given
every chance, and apparently doing well, the colony
gradually disappeared, and it was not till 50 years
later that rabbits again appeared in that country-
side.
“Nitric”: Queer accidents? The other day
at Gore, near Warwick (Q.), a station-owner was
sharpening a chisel on a high-speed emery-wheel.
The latter evidently contained a flaw, for while
revolving it suddenly flew into pieces. One piece
struck the grazier on the chin, and he was dead
almost before he hit the ground.
AN EYE FOR THE FITNESS OF THINGS.
“By cripc, missus, mine thinkit better we swap dogs. Mine good skinny [?]feller, too."
“Olla Podrida”: “A.P.M.’s” swallow en-
twined in the fleece (B. 14/l/’26) is rather hard to
masticate. Once upon a time in the Riverina I also
followed the gentlemanly occupation of classer, and
was often gulled into believing that most extraordi-
nary things had happened in and around the shearing-
shed. If “A.P.M.” had investigated more closely he
would probably have found the swallow- ‘cleverly
trussed with thread and cunningly imprisoned in
the fleece, only a few minutes before being called
to the woolshed. Had he looked towards the roof
he might have seen the swallow’s mate, blinking in
wonderment at the miracle! - The funny part about
these “survivals” is that a jackeroo is invariably
picked to be the star guest at the entertainment.
* * * *
“Midford”: The periodical controversy
about Australia’s rabbits and to whom it is indebted
therefor recalls the most amazing expedient that
was ever tried to stem the march of the advancing
rodents. In 1896 the W.A.* Government discovered
that the van of the furry host was
slowly making- its way westward
along the shore Of the Great Aus-
tralian Bight, and ' Parliament
solemnly debated what it should
do to head back the invaders. The
idea of a State fence was regarded
as too expensive in those days,
though hundreds of thousands of
pounds have since been spent in
that direction. The late Alex.
Forrest, brother of Bigjohn,
thought that a few sturdy fellows
equipped with guns, ferrets and
sticks could hold the foe in cheek
indeterminately. They could never
cross the continent, he argued,
except by keeping close to the
coast—further inland the desert
must prove a natural barrier —and
a mere handful of men could do
the Horatius trick. “How about
cats?” suggested someone, and cats
being cheap, it was determined to
give them a trial. A hundred of
these potential rabbit-slayers were
collected in Perth without more
ado and entrusted to the skipper
of a coastal schooner, who was
instructed to loose them at a point
about 20 miles ahead of (the
coney’s furthest west. A fine sub-
ject for a historical painting was
lost by the neglect to send an
artist with the expedition, but
the cats -were duly liberated where
it was reckoned their activities
would be most profitable. What
became of them has never been ascertained, but
within two or three years rabbits were being reported
on the outlying goldfields.
* * * #
“Gnarek”: Twenty-eight years ago young
George Gamble lost a medal near the weir at
Quambatook (Vic.). A week or two ago it was
found and returned to its owner, now president of
the Waranga Shire. Things even more startling
happen occasionally. An ancient mariner on the
Murray once told me how in his boyhood he had
borrowed his father’s watch and departed on a
fishing expedition. While leaning over the side of
the boat the watch and its chain fell from his pocket
into deep water. Some 20 years after, when walking
along the banks of the Murray, he sat down on an
old log that had been washed up during flood-time—
and on a limb the watch and chain were hanging!
“Kenric” : Can any Abo. naturalist tell mo
the name and diet of the hopper found clinging to
brigalow-trces ? He is of the same build as the
grasshopper, but does not feed on grass —unless '.e
is a nocturnal prowler. He is very hard to see
unless moving, as his coat is the same color as the
brigalow bark to which he clings.
“Centurion” : I am afraid “Sucre” has been
misled. He says (B. 21/l/’26) there is nothing
in our fauna records to show that the dingo came
to Australia before the white men of the First
Fleet. The red dog’s fossil bones lie in many an
Australian geological “graveyard” mingled with
those of the long-extinct giant marsupials that some
theorists are beginning to think came with him, or
before him, across the land bridges which once linked
Australia with Central Asia. Dampier and Captain
Cook, both ante-dating the First Fleet, could
administer another kick to “Sucre’s” theory. Each
has noted his first introduction to the dingo, as
domesticated by the aboriginals.
» * ♦ *
“King Kurrajong”: Contrary to general
belief, city horses are, as a rule, much better than
their country confreres, especially heavy horses. The
lowest grades of neddies are to be found in the
country' towns and cocky districts, although many
good teams and a few fair gig-horses are toj be
seen. For hacks o n e must go to the big Queens-
land stations. It costs so much to take a stallion
out there that he is usually a good one. On Thurul-
goona, Cunnamulla, most of the mares are by Black
Eagle, and their progeny (by Svvanee River) t are
fit to grace any' race-track. There are some nundreds
of them. Other famous breeds are the “flower-pot”
brand of Brenda and the Thirty Plains stock.
* * * *
“Adamascus”: It is not only nettles that
make an astonishing growth in the rich soil brought
down by' the flood waters of the Snowy: River to
Orbost (B. 21/l/’26). This soil is deposited in such
quantities that fences have sometimes to be raised,
but to this the fanners make no objection, since the
ground produces record crops. Similarly', on the
Hunter 1 flats (N.S.W.) the soil is exceptionally
fertile; there are no fences separating some of the
farms, as posts and rails mean so much wasted land.
It is a debatable point whether the Maitland or the
Orbost crops are the better.
* * * *
“Pakehaha”: I wonder what the glow-
worms will think of the electric light to be installed
in the Waitomo Caves (M.L.) in imitation of Jenolar..
The indefatigable little insects are very jealous
of competition, even from a tallow-dip. All lights
are doused when sightseers step aboard the boat
that takes them into the cavern where they work
their enchantment, and conversation is forbidden.
A whisper will- cause the switching-off of several
square yards of the illumination, and once when a
Yankee tourist insisted on raising his voice in
admiration four million worms promptly registered
a protest. I counted them.
* * < # *
“C. Coral”: “Gouger” is not quite correct
in telling us (B. 26/11/’25) that the Murray Island
word “lamoor” (it is “lamar” really) means “white
man.” “Lamar” is certainly used of white people,
and a mother will often scare her infant by pointing
to a visitor and saying “Lamar! Lamar!” in the
same way that a white parent will produce a colored
bogey; but this is only an incidental use of the
word. In the eastern islands of Torres Strait “lamar”
denotes the spirit of a dead person, or what is
usually meant by “ghost” (the same term is used
in native hymn and Biblical translations for “spirit”),
while for the spirit of the living the word is
“mar,” which is also applied to a man’s shadow.
In the western group the corresponding words are
“markai” and “mari” respectively. Native legends
and stories of crime-detection always make a dis-
tinction between the two; as for instance, when a
person died in the old days and the circumstances
seemed suspicious, watchers waited for his markai,
which in due course issued forth from the body, pro-
ceeded to the house of the guilty one, and presently
came forth accompanied by the mari of its owner as
an indication as to where the blame might be placed.
The old Zogo-men found the lamar or markai very
convenient at times in working up some special point
of ceremonial. One of their methods was to
stretch lines between trees outside a house with
rattling nuts placed thereon, which usually produced
the kind of noise a wandering spirit was supposed
to make. In many legends, the markai also figures
as an underground goblin who performs all sorts
of weird things, from producing earth shocks to
running away with children.
* * * *
“Jesmond”: A year or two ago I wrote
about a homing swan which waddled 12 miles to her
pen at Cowes (Vic.) after being taken away. A
month or two after her return she was again taken
away and was not seen until a week ago. A flock
of swans flew across about 200 yards from the
house. One of them hesitated ; then she came down
to the gate and squawked her greetings. It was the
same old swan, identified by a leg-ring. But she
only stayed to say “How do you do?” then flew off
in a hurry to join her mates.
* * * *
‘‘Stump Picker”: I have had many a good
night’s sleep in a stripper box (B. 14/l/’26) whilst
cocky ing in the Victorian mallee. Nevertheless,
there were more desirable doVmitories during the
mouse plague of ’2l. My mate and I finally hit on
the device of plugging the passage from the beater
drum to the box with bags and closing the door
down hard when retiring, to make our sleeping
quarters mouse proof. Our ventilators were the wire-
covered windows that let the dust out While stripping.
The best stripper 1 ever used as a bedroom was a
Shearer 7ft. comb machine. The box was wide
enough to let us lie across it with very little bending,
* * * *
“Keppel”: Re the discussion concerning
the good and bad points of the crow. At least one
Queensland local authority, the Isis Shire Council,
is convinced that this bird is one of the cane-
farmer’s greatest friends, and consequently should
not be destroyed. Instances have been produced to
show that the freedom from grubs in the district
is due almost entirely to crows, whereas the much-
praised minahs have been proved to be loafers
addicted to making nuisances of themselves on house-
roofs instead of doing their job of pest-destruction.
The council has taken steps with a view* to having
the bonus on dead crows withdrawn and the birds
themselves fully protected.

“Prizeloser”: Re “Dingo’s” assertion (t>.
17/12 /’ 25) that cattle suffering from tuberculosis,
etc., when killed and the diseased portion cut out,
are passed on for human consumption. In M.L.
every abattoir has its highly-qualified V.S., and not
an animal with a speck of the disease named can get
through. I took 100 cows to Waitara freezing works,
and two were condemned. One had a few tiny
red spots, the size of pinheads, on the membrane
surrounding the intestines, and the other had its lung
affected. No other trace of t.b. could be found,
yet both “went down the shoot” to be converted into
manure. Even the slaughtermen thought it hard lines,
the extent of the disease being so trivial.
FOR THE SAKE OF THE BOY.
THE PHILANTHROPIST: “I’m surprised at
your employing a boy like that who
smokes cigarettes about the shop!"
ISAACSTEIN: “Well, der poor little fellow
tost ’is job in der varehouse for throwing
his bumpers in der vaste-paper basket.
It vas a bad habit, and someday sometin’
may happen and der shock of der fire
may cure him."
“Zanthus”: Bread cast on the waters isn’t

A year ago Frank Your on lost his wallet with £42
in notes in it when he was riding through a lagoon
at Natte Yallock (Vic.). After several tries to
locate it he concluded that the money was gone
for goo.d. But the recent hot weather, dried up the
lagoon, and a neighbor picked up the wallet and
handed it over to the owner. The numbers of the
notes could still be made out.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Fourteen cases of alleged assault and various
cross-charges, arising out of a dance held at Ironpot
Creek, were heard at the Kyogle (N.S.W.) police
court. The evidence showed that when dances were
held at the local hall the young men came with their
coats off and sleeves rolled up, and some of the
women with sticks in their hands. On this occa-
sion proceedings started at 9 p.m. with abusive
epithets, then blows, and then a free fight. After
supper the fight was renewed and kept going
inside and outside the hall till 3 o’clock in the
morning. Some of the young men were knocked
out. The girls remained throughout the whole
proceedings.”—S. M. Hkrali).
At Ironpot Creek no coats they wear,
The men who meet to whirl the fair
In mazy dances to and fro,
For sleeves are hampering, you know l ,
When one would deal a vicious blow
Or else for self-defence prepare
At Iroripot Creek.
Wisest is he who waltzes there
With sleeves uprolled and biceps bare;
In collars high the city beau
May revel and in cuffs of snow.
It’s quite a different affair
At Ironpot Creek.
At Ironpot Creek musicians blare
From time to time a martial air,
For dreamy, melting strains and slow,
’Tis clear, are hardly apropos
When one abandons heel-and-toe
Into a rival swain to tear
At Ironpot Creek.
Soft rounded arms and shingled hair
Males, as per usual, ensnare,
But fans the damosels. forego—
A stick is held more comme il faui
When ladies to a hop repair
At Ironpot Creek.
At Ironpot Creek, like anywhere
Else, lips their owners’ love declare
And limpid eyes with rapture glow
Just as at Brussels long ago —
But war is even closer, though
The dancers mix it then and there
At Ironpot Creek.
Venus with Mars the hall must share,
For love and lash there’s time to spare;
One moment you’ve a girl in tow,
The next you leap upon the foe
With ardor every bit as rare
At Ironpot Creek.

A WOMAN'S
LETTER
SAY-
Kayser
GLOVES
The Rising Sun fluttered gaiiy on the
harbor as the pinnaces of the Iwate whizzed
backward and forward between Man-o’-War
Steps and the training-ship on the day
Sydney was asked in to enjoy the hospitality
of Captain Yuriiclii Yedahara and his offi-
cers. It was a cosmopolitan party, the com-
pany mingling naval, military and civil
officials, boy-scouts, sea-cadets and bright-
eyed, pomegranate-skinned Japanese child-
ren. The manners of the sailor hosts were
a joy to those feminine souls who cherish
deep in their hearts a regret for the passing
of the days of chivalry. Each lady was
gallantly handed on and off the pinnace.
At the top of the gangway a white-clad officer
bowed deeply and ejaculated “Welcome!” to
every comer; a second one presented you to
the captain, who passed the guest along to
another officer, who pinned a favor on the
lady’s blouse —the Union Jack and the
Japanese flag resting in silken content side
by side.
Although the ship was very pictux*esque
with flags and lanterns, one could not help
recalling the wonderful decorations of the
Japanese fleet which visited us during war-
time. On this occasion everything was Euro-
pean, except that the truly-English sand-
wiches reposed under a bower of cherry-
blossoms. so pretty it seemed a shame to
disturb them. The sailors provided a spec-
tacular interlude with a bout of fearsome
fencing, and made such savage noises that
one kept an anxious eye on the ship’s side.
They also provided a fancy-dress procession
which embodied a story of the tenth century
about a gentle and mighty boy who sprang
from a fruit and conquered an island with
the help of a dog. a monkey and a pheasant.
Japanese Consul-General Tokugawa and
Vice-Consul Yamasaki assisted with the cere-
monial receptions and presentation, and it
was delightful to sit and watch the inter-
change of courtesy between the naval men
and the Japanese community. Prominent
among our navy representatives were Com-
mander and Mrs. Robins, with Violet and
Jocelyn. The military brass-hats included
Major-General and Mrs. Bruche and General
and Mrs. Cox Taylor. Belgian Consul Se-
gaert’s spouse wore a sapphire-blue georgette
frock; and the youthful bride of French
Consul-General Nettement was a cool vision
in a white crepe-de-Chine frock with a gar-
den of pink roses crowning her white crin.
hat.
Next day the Consul-General for Japan
took a hand in the entertaining with a
reception at the Ambassadors. The occasion
celebrated the 2585th anniversary of the
foundation of the empire of Japan, and the
Ambassadors made a gallant effort to do
honor to such a birthday with decorations
of cheery blossoms, wistaria and white
streamers and a silken Japanese flag. It
was a most formal affair. The Consul-
General received each guest and made a
presentation to Captain Yedahara and Cap-
tain Asariot (of the Taisei Maru), and then
included the officers and midshipmites in a
general bow. The State Government was re-
presented by Hon. Minister ,T. F. Coates,
and there was the usual crowd of naval,
military and civil officials and a fair sprink-
ling of mere taxpayers. When the formali-
ties were over the white-clad naval visitors
two-stepped. Guests were further enlivened
with typed copies of the story of the founda-
tion of Japan. First a god and goddess
created the Japanese island. Their daughter
taught the men to cultivate the earth and
the women to weave silk. Their son kept
them in “kindly” subjection, and when he
had them well trained presented the whole
kingdom to Auntie, who never condescended
to come down from Heaven, but sent her
grandson to rule, and the present Emperor
of Japan is a direct descendant from those
august personages. So long as a monarch
can get his people to believe such pretty
fancies he need never worry about their
loyalty and devotion.
Captain Yedahara and his staff gave a
“sumchus repast,” as the Young Visiter
would have said, just before pulling up an-
chor to leave Sydney. The affair took the
form of an official dinner on the Iwate,
which still shows the carefully-preserved
holes put in her wardroom stanchions by
Russian guns years ago. When even the
best trenchermen present cried enough, two
stupendous turkeys were carried in, while
Consul-General Tokugawa beamed at the
sensation of the evening.
General Bruche’s graceful lady—she used
to be Miss MacFarlane, of Crow’s Nest—
hostessed at a tennis party to Japan in Vic-
toria Barracks. Under the shade of a flutter
of striped awning she received the handshakes
of the visitors before going on to the cherry-
blossom party at the Ambassadors. Two
lawns were worked overtime, and younger
Japan stuck to the racquets in professional
style.
This is Miss Nell B. Dungey, newly-
appointed organiser of the Country Women’s
Association of
N. S Wales.
Before Sydney
claimed he r
she was busy
with the in-
terests of the
women a n d
children of
Perth. She
was one of
the organisers
of the Parker-
ville Home
and of the
Women’s Arts
and Industries
Exchange, and
was an active
worker for
i m m i g r a t ion
und e r the
group - settle-
ment pla n.
She has al-
ready travelled over half N. S. Wales in the
interests of the C.W.A., and has formed
many new branches. When in Sydney she
devotes her time to laying the plans for the
appeal for £25,000 which is to be launched
in a few weeks. The picture is from the-
Dayne studio.
Mary Cadell was one of last week’s many
charming brides. Rev. Clive Yarrington
made her Mrs. Gordon Brownhill at St.
Clement’s, Mosman ; and her future address
will he Beaudesert, Mudgee. Her girlish
bridal frock was of ivory georgette with a
long bodice hugging her slim young figure,
and a very full skirt embroidered in silver,
crystal and diamente. She showed something
new in the arrangement of her unlined tulle
train. It was caught together at the termin-
ation with a bunch of carnations worked in
diamente and crystal and tied with a silver
bow. A plain tulle veil was held with
orange-blossoms, and she carried white tiger-
lilies. Marjorie Cadell and Jean Browmhill
graced the bridesmaids’ job in petalled frocks
of apricot georgette and black velvet picture-
hats.
The same evening cricketer Walter Graham
Brown kept an appointment with Edna Irons
at the Mosman Presbyterian Church, where
the Rev. J. Calder tied the knot. The bride
gleamed like a dewdrop in her silver gown
draped with georgette, and pale pink flushed
from her tulle train. Nea Pike did the
attendant duties in delphinium-blue, and
Jack McCauslartd was best man.
Just about the same hour the Great Syna-
gogue Was staging a picturesque wedding
with Betty Lapin and Norman Block as the
principals. Rabbi Cohen had the assistance
of the Revs. Einfeld and Falk. The little
brunette bride scintillated with diamente and
crystals, and her veil was held with a dia-
mente coronet. There were three silver- and
ombre-clad bridesmaids, the bride’s cousin
and the groom’s two sisters, and two little
shimmering train-bearers. Mr. and Mrs.
Mark Lapin entertained about 200 guests
at the Maccabean Hall.
At St. James’s there was a linking-up of
legal and medical families. A. B. Shand's
only son, John, was married to Dr. A. C.
Holt’s daughter Enid. Crystal-beaded geor-
gette and a pink tulle train and a pink
rose bouquet allied to make the bride a
charming vision. Her sister Phyllis and the
’groom’s sister Ethel followed the bride in
frocks of hydrangea blue and silver lace.
The bride’s mother wore a handsome turn-
out of Madonna blue steel-beaded georgette
and a black ospreyed hat to receive the
guests at the Ambassadors.
St. John’s, Darlinghurst, was in the
scramble, too. The picturesque old church
was chosen by Clare Musgrave and Frank
Murglia Mack, of Narromide, for their wed-
ding. The bride favored the popular cream
georgette for her gown, and wore the tulle
veil of her aunt, Mrs. Chadwick, of Mel-
bourne. Sister Noel and Kathleen Kater
bridesmaided in pink satin frocks and silver
turbans. The bride’s mother gave a recep-
tion at the Waratah.
St Andrew’s Cathedral also had its wed-
ding, Dean Talbot officiating when Donald
Sutherland, of Auckland, married Marjorie
Hamilton, daughter of H. J. Hamilton, of
Melbourne. Such a girlish vision she was in
an old-w T orld frock of shell-pink crepe de
Chine, with tiny frills finishing the short
sleeves and skirt. Instead of the customary
veil she wore a pink crinoline hat and
carried a sheaf of pink carnations. Her
sister Mrs. K. Williams was matron of
honor, and little Audrey Williams strewed
flowers in her path. Paris House was the
rendezvous for congratulations and “God-
speed"’ for a tour of the world.
Mary Florence, only surviving chick of the
George Coates couple of Boomerah, Parra-
matta, lately became Mrs. Thomas Johnston
Waddell at St. Stephen’s. The bridegroom
hails from Falkirk, Scotland. Jean Buch-
anan, of Drummoyne, was in attendance
upon the bride, prettily clad in bois-du-
rose georgette with a flower-trimmed hat to
match.
The week-end had a grand finale to a
season of weddings when Arnold Resell, the
wealthy brewer, defendant in the most re-
markable of the many breach-of-promise
cases that flattened the lawyers last year,
married Tottie Dennis. The event was
almost a secret, and only relatives
and a few friends of the bride were
present in St. Mark’s. In a long wait for his
lady the groom grew too nervous to conceal
his perturbation, and sent agitated messages
to the clergyman. When she did appear on
the arm of her step-father, G. H. Webb,
with her sister Vera in attendance, he heaved
an audible sigh of relief, and greeted her
with a radiant smile. Her dark glossy hair
was parted in the middle, draped over her
ears and knotted just above the nape of her
neck. A lovely Limerick lace veil was
arranged with slender trails of orange blos-
som like a Grecian filet, and the tall, slender
young figure was swathed in cloth of silver
veiled in georgette. Bob Sproule, M.L.C.,
upheld the bridegroom through his anxious
half-hour. The bride is the eldest daughter
of the late G. S. Dennis. Her mother
and Mr. Webb entertained a few friends
afterwards at the Astor. Mr. and Mrs.
Resch are having a motor tour before
settling down to domesticity.
The accountancy department of the Datly
Telegraph was desolated last week to lose
the efficient comptometress, Eve Dunn. Her
classic head, thatched with hair as black as
a crow’s wing, holds the real mathematical
brain, according to Jock Spedding, chief
accountant. With a speech full of regret at
parting, and as lavish with good wishes for
the future, Mr. Spedding handed Eve a
cabinet of cutlery from her co-workers. The
cutlery will be very handy, as the petite
young woman is going to use her mathemati-
cal abilities in running the domestic affairs
of R. W. Coulter, the clever young black-
and-white artist of the Woman’s Mirror
staff, whose drawings also attract attention
in The Bulletin.
Isabel Macdonald, the fair and slender
step-daughter of Mrs. Frederick Cooke, of
Turramurra, accompanied Harold Regan,
eldest son of Mrs. Charles Regan, of Tam-
worth, on a jaunt around the jewellers’
shops last week to find a fitting gem for her
engagement finger. The wedding will take
place about Easter.
Here is a little picture of Edith Hubbard,
secretary at the Belgian Consulate-General
in Sydney,
who has just
received he r
second decora-
tion ; first she
got the Med-
aille de la
Reine Eliza-
beth, estab-
lished for ladies
who had con-
tributed with
distinction to
the war works
of Belgium;
now come the
Golden Palms
of the Order
of the Crown
for her ser-
vices to the
little kingdom
under the
rule of throe
Australian Consuls-General. To better fit
her for her work, Miss Hubbard, an Aus-
tralian by birth, has travelled extensively in
Europe, and has cultivated a Working know-
ledge of most of the tongues of the western
half of the continent.
A cable from a loved sister, Elizabeth
(Mrs. Arthur Hunt), hurried Mrs. Steer
Bowker and daughter Marjorie off to Paris
after the wedding of Barbara and Alan
Graeme Potter. , The invalid is seriously ill
under a specialist’s care, and the anxious
relatives left by Sunday night’s express to
join the Maloja at Melbourne. Mrs. Hunt
is the second of three handsome daughters
of the late John Marks, M.L.C. The young-
est is the faif-haired Mrs. George Vivers.
Mrs. Arthilr Scrivener arranged another
of her delightful musicales at Burdekin
House last week to give the finances of the
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital a lift. Indian
love lyrics were chanted by a quartette in
flowing robes and an atmosphere of rugs
brasses and exotic perfumes. The singers
were Dulcie Starkey, Netta Mullarkey.
Ohrer Waters (tenor) and Roy Scrivener
(baritone). The treasures that created the
realistic aura were from Mrs. Scrivener’s
trophies secured while travelling in India.
Mrs. Arthur Allen opened the £25,000
drive for the Mothercraft Society at Kari-
tane on Saturday afternoon. The big effort
will occupy six weeks, and it is hoped that
the result will be an office in town so that
mothers from far-out suburbs will not have
to drag to Coogee when Matron MacMillan,
the doyen of the Plunket nurses, has to be
consulted about Little Tommy’s welfare. A
crowd of smart matrons and pretty girls
launched the drive in a practical manner by
bringing each a piece of linen for the Kari‘-
tane cupboards. Matron MacMillan and the
nurses served tea on the lawn.
Captain Hamilton, of the China-liner Tai-
pmg, gave a dance on Friday night. On the
uecks the guests enjoyed jazzing to a delight-
ful orchestra, while a cool sea breeze fanned
the sheltering flags and swayed beautifully-
colored and fantastically-shaped lanterns.
The guests included the leading lights of the
Chinese community of Sydney.
A few enthusiasts met in the Repertory-
Society’s rooms on Friday to discuss chances
of a civic opera co. in Sydney. Roland
Foster considered the project quite feasible,
instancing what had been done last year by
the Conservatorium. Mr. Salmon, Registrar
of the Con., seemed loath to damp Roland
Foster’s ardor, and more in sorrow than in
triumph mentioned that the cost of the five
performances of “The Marriage of Figaro"
was £540, with singers’ and conductors’ ser-
vices thrown in, and those of half the orches-
tra. And not a tittle of extravagance in
the whole season either. Gregan McMahon
quite agreed with Mr. Salmon’s practical
suggestion that a detailed forecast of expen-
diture should be prepared before asking the
public to subscribe. This sensible plan was
adopted and a committee appointed to do
the job.
Mrs. Morris Symonds was farewelled by
the Council of Jewish Women in the draw-
ing-room of the Carlton on the eve of her
departure on a world’s tour with her hus-
band. They are going to call on the Restored
Jerusalem her husband recently gave a
modest £5OOO to its university. Vice-Presi-
dent Mrs. J. Marks presented a posy and a
writing-case.
Miss Brisbane tells of many marriages:—
The Plane-Cramond wedding was an event of the
week in Toowoomba; Padre Plane’s eldest son,
Captain A. A. Plane, took unto himself Jean Cramond,
daughter of the David Cramonds, in St. Stephen’s.
The bride wore ivory Lascelles silk, beaded with
crystal and pink. Her train of ivory mariette was
lined with pale pink to match the beads. Her tulle
veil was fastened with silver leaves and orange
blossom and her bouquet was white rosebuds.
Marjorie Scholefield and Elvie Plane ’maided in rose
color with gold roses, gold and rose turbans, finished
with pink rosebuds. Ivy Plane’s beautiful voice
was heard in “Beloved, It Is Mom” while the register
was signed.
At St. Andrew’s, South Brisbane, Cecil Whitehouse
and Hilda Allen were made one under an arch of
pink and white flowers. The bride, in shell-pink
crepe de Chine over satin, had a veil of pale pink,
broidered in silver, and she carried pink carnations.
I). Allen and Flora Black ’maided in pink crepe,
Eva Lang played the organ and Doris Hansen sang
“My Prayer.” Tweed Heads sees the honeymoon.
Longreach also contributed a wedding bell, Robert
Barr, of Ilfracombe, marrying Charlotte Scholefield.
The bride was in white mariette, carrying white
lilies. Nancy Scholefield (in powder blue) and Enid
Aland (in pink) w-ere bridesmaids. The bride's
widowed mother had a reception, and a motor carried
off the bride for the honeymoon in Sydney.
The Royal Quensland Golf Club had an at-home
at the club-house. Mrs. Brown, who wore ivory-
pussy-willovv and an ivory- Milan hat with a Bur-
gundy red parasol, presented the winners with their
trophies. A band played, and tea was sipped at
tables gay w-ith mauve and pink asters.
On the river the junior skippers of the R.Q.Y.C.
raced for the Vidgen Cup. On the Mahara were
Commodore and Mrs. Douglas, while the Planet was
flagship, carrying the E. S. Hopkinses and many
fair maidens. Meanwhile the Old Boys’ Rowing Club
had its first rowing regatta on the bridge reach.
Nancy 111. flag-shipped, with Archgaiters Sharp, the
A. C. Barlows and others aboard.
Ruby Massey is going in seriously for elocution
and has severed her connection with the “Hello”
girls. When she left Albion, they gave her a set
of books and a clock. At the Central Exchange, Mr.
Sugden handed her a diamond ring and a silver vase,
and gave her assurances of the esteem of her late
colleagues. There were also minor gifts from
friends in the service. Ruby- has been supervising
the Albion telephone staff for some years.
Prior to her wedding, a party was given for Laurie
Shannon at the Bellevue by her sisters, M. and C.
Shannon, the one in shell pink, the other in red.
Laurie wore coral mariette.
Toowoomba rose to a masked and fancy-dress ball
last week, when lanterns and red and white streamers
and beautiful Kimblehurst dahlias decorated the
supper tables at Picnic Point, and Sylvia Burns
Kostessed. Seweral Brisbane maidens were amongst
the invited.

TWO BANKS IN ONE.
The General Banking Department opens current (cheque) accounts and
transacts every kind of Banking business associated with cheque accounts such
as the accepting of fixed deposits at interest, the issue of drafts and letters of
credit and the transaction of international business.
The Savings Bank Department provides a most efficient service for the thrifty
and for the people of smaller means, a service that includes interest-bearing
Savings accounts, the money-box and many banking facilities.
Both Departments will be found in every one of the Bank’s 87 Branches,
and in addition practically every Post Office in Australia is an agency of the
Savings Bank.
You can do business with either department, or both*

MISSES MONKE DOVLE
Phones Cotral 1532, 1533.
The sex which for the past few months
has pulled close-fitting headpieces down to
its eyebrows just as clieea-fully prepared for
Caulfield by pinning back the brim with a
near-brilliant brooch, or by rushing off and
buying one of the small turrMed-off-tlie-face
felt hats which are the first harbingers of the
winter fashions. Though the sun threatened
to burn and freckle mercilessly, matrons and
maids smiled beneath their new head-gear,
for at least one favorite got home. Frocks
were mainly of the filmy ordler, in lace and
georgette, with a fair representation of
crepe de Chine and silk juntiper-suits with
knife-pleated skirts. One of the prettiest of
these was worn by Mrs. Archie Murray, of
Tasmania: it was of mole hue, picked out
with cyclamen and topped by a felt head-
piece of the cowboy type. Mrs. Ben Chaffey,
whose heart beat anxiously until Whittier
got home, wore black georgette with floral
applique of royal-blue and .gold. Mrs. Frank
Clarke, looking as young as her daughter,
had lilac crin. millinery allied to petunia-
pink georgette, and strings of pearls, natural
and pink. The Connolly maiden, Iris, had
cream lace covering, and flowers scattered
over a heliotrope hat. Joan Chirnside made
an effective contrast, her black marocain
frock being worn with a powder-blue felt hat.
Miss Ella Payne, lately returned from
Europe, sported a brown crin. hat from which
golden grapes dangled upon a gown of fawn
georgette, njinutely tucked. A petunia felt
headpiece topped Mrs. Harry Creswick’s
apparel of biscuit georgette and lace, and
Mrs. Fred Payne allied an ecru lace robe
with nigger-brown straw hat. Sleeveless
gowns seemed not so popular as usual.
The Hugh Ward management has put on
“The Honeymoon Girl,” with rolled-stocking
ballets, as a stop-gap until Nanette of the
double negative goes to Sydney. The pre-
miere at the Princess attracted a big crowd
■ —rather better dressed, so far as stalls were
concerned, than the folk on the other side of
the footlights. Feminine first-nighters mostly
favored greens, pinks and sparkles. Leading-
lady Madge White filled the bill as the
French dancer in nifty clothing. One of her
frocks, of powder-blue brocaded velvet, with
additional short coat of plain velvet, and
some brown fur worn with a turban toque,
showed up well against a background of
dancers in frills of varying shades of orange.
In another scene Madge’s fair shingle blended
effectively with angel sleeves of crimson
georgette attached to brocade of the same
splashed with silver, and a big tassel of
green and red. Pollv Power showed her
rolled hose beneath a couple of dainty new
frocks. Les. Pearce, who evidently is going
in for dieting, presented some ideas about
the correct attire for a bridegroom—black
coat, trousers of tiny black-and-white check,-
a broad expanse of dove-grey waistcoat, a
long tie of many colors, and white spats.
Among the boxites were Dot Brunton, with
a bouquet of La France roses, which matched
a glistening frock, and Elsie Prince, in
fuchsia-colored beaded gown, accompanied
by her mother, a charming matron in spark-
ling grey raiment.
Flowering gum-trees planted in memory
of Australia’s fallen soldiers add grace and
beauty to the roads from North Brighton
to the cemetery, and from Sandringham to
Black Rock. At this season clusters of
blossoms, crimson, cream, orange and all
shades of pink, give the highways a decora-
tive border, inevitably suggesting a question
'as to why more of these beautiful native
trees are not planted.
When it was bruited about a few years
ago that a factory was to be set down near
the sacred precincts of the Royal Melbourne
Golf Club, society in Sandringham and Black
Rock shuddered. Now the very naicest resi-
dents thrill with pride as they tell the visitor
“You really must see our factory!” The
reference is to the works of the Semco Art
Needlework firm, which took root at Black
Rock about two years ago on six acres of
ground. But they planted a factory of quite
a new sort. There are sundry red-and-white
brick one-storeyed buildings, separated by
gravel paths, with plots of begonias and tree-
ferns, green lawns and beds of flowers of
evei’y hue, and hedges of hollyhocks and
cannas. There is also a sports ground, with
cricket-pitch and miniature golf-links, for
the benefit of the workers. The girls who
toil amid these pleasant surroundings carried
off the Cup at the inter-business sports com-
petitions last year. The designing depart-
ment, housed apart, well away from the
whirl of machinery, employs about 16 girls,
all students from our technical colleges and
guided by Miss Millicent White. Semco was
not an exhibitor at the A.N.A. Show, but
held a successful exhibition of its own in
its recreation-hall. The substantial prizes
ofl&red tempted entries from all over the
continent. The concern dyes all its
own thread, artificial silks and silkette, and
does it as well as any foreigner. Manager
Mylius lias two weaknesses—gardening and
music. Community singing is part of the
factory’s curriculum, as it were. But there
are baseball, cricket, golf and dancing also,
and the staff has three bathing-boxes on the
beach.
All the motor vehicles in tfie world seemed
to be parked around Caulfield for the first
day of the V.A.T.C. Autumn Meeting. The
weather was hot—not at all the imitation
winter stuff we have been getting—and out
of the shade of the stands the equator
seemed very near. Governor Stradbroke was
there, hoping against hope to see Night
Patrol win, but tlie geegee couldn’t manage
it. Her Ex., in draperies of black georgette
and tulle, with black-and-white millinery;
daughter Helena, with golden-brown picture
hat above wistaria floral ninon ; and son John
Anthony made a nice family party. They
roped in a few members of the committee
and other sports for lunch.
The stately calm of a really fraightfully
smart lodging-house was badly fractured
the other day. A series of quarrels between
a pair of youngsters in residence resulted
in so determined a scrap that an adult male
broke one of the small arms in. two places
before lie could pry the gladiators apart.
The daddy of the fractured infant did his
best to break all the bones of the too-
strenuous peacemaker. Scenting low, vulgar
police-court proceedings, some of the naicest
of the guests hastily tumbled their lingerie
into a chariot and gasped “Menzies’,” while
another family, with nerves all upset by the
fracas, fled to the sanctuary of the nearest
vacant house, determined to secure peace
at the cost even of having to do all chores.
Philippa James has climbed to fame in a
short year. In a little pottery in the
garden of her
home she
“throws” and
hakes all her
pieces, evolves
new shapes
and experi-
ments in color
glazes. Her
hydrangea-
pink is the
despair of
older follow-
ers of the
craft, and her
jugs, bowls,
v a s e s and
other articles
of cobalt-blue,
Wed gwo o d-
black, seduc-
tive greens
and gorgeous
reds have
earned her
much praise. She favors decorative designs
with an Australian motif -—■ gum-leaves,
-nuts and -blossoms, with perhaps a locust,
or some other indigenous insect perched
thereon, a spray of wattle or a wind-swept
tree. Merric Boyd first trained the un-
shingled, fair-haired, blue-eyed maiden’s
capable fingers, and the Brunswick Technical
College has taught her how to fire a kiln.
No really truly art-potter ever trusts anyone
else with the firing of his or her creations,
for on the firing tlie whole effect depends.
The Arts and Crafts Society and several art
shops stock “Phil’s” wares, and at Christmas
she found her stock, which realised splendid
prices, quite unequal to demands. Her first
exhibition is promised towards the end of
this year.
Director of theatrical concerns Isaacson,
whose other hobby is the strenuous col-
lection of relics of “old Bony,” is a bachelor
who annually assumes fqr one night only the
role of mother of 50, whom he takes to the
panto. “Aladdin” was this’year’s choice. A
big yellow ’bus picks up the brood at various
collecting-points and takes them to the
theatre. From long experience Mr. Isaacson
has learnt how to manage his party down to
the minutest detail, and his rage when any
over-anxious parent tries to help is as the
fury of a woman scorned.
A milkman confessed in a Melbourne police
court the other day to an unfortunate mis-
take. He called at a house when the lady
was out and abstracted a crepe-de-Chine
dress. “Is that a dress?” remarked the mag-
istrate. “It looks to me like a pocket-hand-
kerchief.” “That’s exactly what I thought,”
said the accused, who seems to be a quick
thinker. “I wanted a rag to wipe my milk-
bottles, and so I took it.” His case was
adjourned for 12 months, but what the lady
thought about the insult to her wardrobe
hasn’t been published.
Dr. Effie Stillwell is back in Melbourne
on furlough from her Zenana mission hos-
pital at Patna. Since her arrival here the
Kaiser-i-Hind silver medal has come her way.
This is one of the few decorations given by
the Indian Government to Europeans, and
is awarded only for distinguished service.
Dr. Stillwell has had 20 years in India,
and the climate seems to have merely sharp-
ened her enthusiasms.
Off to the Great Smoke this week is Mrs.
J. Blainey, who means to do some lecturing
over there to intending immigrants. The
lady has been one of the tutors on the Mel-
bourne Uni. Extension Board.
A cafe at Borne dispenses bacon and
eggs in the small hours, and perfectly reput-
able men and maidens make their parties
all-night affairs. Rather unsettling to staid
minds also are such performances as those
of the maiden who, with but a trifle of cover-
ing, executed a pas seul in the circle of radi-
ance provided by the headlights of a limou-
sine. When Irene Vanbrugh makes her next
visit to Melbourne, she can ring the changes
on her famous supper menu of bread and
sardines a la tin, served in her boudoir. They
do these things much better at Lome,
Roy Shepherd goes to the Big Smoke in
March, to take up his Clarke Scholarship at
the R.A.M.C. Friends will farewell the
young pianist at the Auditorium on March
16. A star item will be the appearance of
St. Paul’s Cathedral Choir under Dr. A. E.
Floyd. Special permission has been given
to the choristers to sing in a secular build-
ing on account of Roy’s long connection with
the choir.
If we haven’t distinctive national schools
of painting and writing it isn’t the fault o£
the Australian Institute of the Arts and
Literature, which is five years old and has
grabbed a publisher, Edwin Vidler, as direc-
tor. Its membership is a regular galaxy of
talent, interspersed with patrons of the
Arts. Once a fortnight, in the cooler months
of the year, the Institute, which has its
headquarters in 178 Collins-street, flows into
the South Gallery of the Vic. Artists’ Soci-
ety building, and gets busy with music, the
drama or a lecture —or maybe all three. The
first of the 1926 gatherings is scheduled for
next month.
Local presswomen plan to give Governor
Stradbroke’s lady a farewell cup of tea on St.
Patrick’s Day at the Lyceum Club.
Renee Kelly, who is to drop Polly and her
past and put on the apron of Judy in
“Daddy Longlegs,” was given u wee kaiß
garoo last week by the sisters of flying-man
Parer. As the little cuss needs special diet
and attention, the actress has sent her pet to
the Zoo until such time as she shall leave
these shores.
The name of Springthorpe appears
amongst steamer bookings for England next
month, The doctor and his lady are going
to call on the daughter who is established
m the Cold Country. The visit was arranged
When Mrs. Tollin came with her two small
sons to see father about a year back. Son
Guy Springthorpe is also in London—he’s
taking a post-grad, course.
The Harvey Patterson pair set out last
week on an extended trip abroad, taking
m the United States and Europe. The lady,
who is always doing unadvertised kindly
acts, was Ella Athelstane on the stage, and
was a pretty member of the Wilson Barrett
company when “The Sign of the Cross” was
seen in this continent.
The business of frock-selling in London
has claimed Mrs. Reg Purbrick, whose many
visits, to the Big Smoke have made her
familiar with its commercial possibilities,
The lady hardly needs to work for her
living, for Bacchus Marsh milk is still a
nice paying proposition!.
Harrietville, the mountain resort in the
North-East, will lose Nurse Jones at the end
of the month, as she has decided to become
the wife of Tom Rust, of Hawthorn, a former
chief president of the A.N.A. When Rust
was very ill a few years ago and was inclined
to make no struggle to hold on to life she
pulled him back from the grave—and so was
born the romance. The Hawthorn A.N.A.
will arrange for a great homecoming.
When Ivy Flight and Edward L. New-
bigm were made one, old St. John’s, Toorak,
wore a maiden blush of pink lilies and
carnations. . Point d’Alencon - lace, ivory
crepe de Chine, orange buds, crystal beads,
water-lilies and billows of tulle were the
main ingredients of the handsome bridal
array. Cecil Tait and Ailsa Roberts were
in attendance in frocks of deep rose hue
petalled over silk lame. The event was after-
wards celebrated at Menzies’, the hostess,
Mrs, T. N. Flight, wearing a gown of black
satin grenadine and lace.
Margot Goyder and her sister Mrs. Neville
Joske, who pool their literary efforts under
the name of Margot Neville, are at work on
a scenario for the Stoll co. A filmed version
of their novel “Safety First” has already
appeared.

Miss Adelaide’s budget of gossip:—
Files and the Horderu-Barry wedding gave us
all the thrill we wanted this week. The fires
licked up miles of scrub at Willunga and at Norton’s
Summit, getting unpleasantly close to the old Baker
homestead (now the Protestant Boys’ Home) and
the viee-regal summer quarters. In town there was
mild panic at the Travellers’ Aid Hostel, full of
women migrants off. the morning’s mail-boat, where
flames got close enough to burn a verandah-post
or two, crack windows and blister paint. Smoke
and water did their worst in the luggage-room,
and sneak-thieves dashed in under cover of saving
Valuables and helped themselves to whatever they
could lay hands on. As a result, most of the
boarders have lost something, and some of them
everything. A fund has been opened to give them
a fresh start.
As for the wedding, it kept the prospective ’groom
busy dodging reporters (or talking to them) from
the moment he got here till dilatory office-cleaners
Were surprised by an extra-early wedding at the
Registrar’s office. The bride bowed to mode and

For the rest, we’d a blistering heat-wavfe (the

to her niece, Mrs. Harry Ayers, on East-terrace, for
her 99th birthday. She came here as a small child
of 10 with Governor Ilindmarsh, and saw and heard
the Province “proclaimed.”
The old C. C. Kingston home at Brighton is
being fitted up with tea-rooms and arbors and other
resources of civilisation by the State Government,
which has taken over the 20 acres as a public reserve
and playground. The property runs down to the
seashore, where two tall pines make a landmark
along that treeless coast. A lot more are to be
planted.
The Ross Smith memorial, the work of Frederick
Hitch, is due at the end of the year, and South
Australians who have seen it in London say it is
good. The statue, which will cost about £5OOO, is to
stand in Cresswell Gardens, beside one of the path-
ways to the oval.
Adelaide railway station has made a good start
on the rebuilding scheme. The constructive work
so far is all on the vacant northern side, where the
trenches for foundations of a big new structure
interfere horribly with the vehicles assembling to
pick up new arrivals. The arches under the road-
way, with a historic interest going back to the
earliest rail, that to Port Adelaide, will disappear.

NOTIONS
There were 20 starters for the 43rd
V.A.T.C. Oakleigh Plate at Caulfield on Saturday, and
class was fairly well represented. Her 9st. 81b.
notwithstanding', Bairn, who had drawn No. 10 marble,
was always at cramped odds, 9 to 4 being the
finishing quote, while Laveuse went out at B’s, \\ arah-
ton and Lady Thrill at 10’s, Triangle at 12’s Royal
Joker at 14’s, and Ivaiwarra and Wai-Lu. at 15\s

r a a )p° l I ~e ! was , leading soon after the start, with
ady thrill Waranton, Laveuse and Perspective
nearest of the others; but she took the home turn
badly and Lady Thrill, who also swung out a bit,
led into the straight. Here Perspective dashed
through on the rails and, finishing strongly, Jimmy
,1™' s .mare won well by a length from Lady
A? I .*’ ' waranton the same distance away third,
Wai-Lu fourth, Laveuse fifth, and Bairn, who tired
under her big weight, second last. Perspective had

been at a much shorter price (she was 20’s at the
finish) but for an impression that she would not get
away smartly. Trained as well as owned by the
veteran James Wilson, she is a six-year-old bay
mare by The Welkin —Monodia, and, as her 71b.
penalty only brings her weight to Bst., slje must
have a chance in the Newmarket Handicap. Veteran

down to 5 to 4. His conqueror and Pantheon were

Vt-J - Heroie gave another of his exasperating
exhibitions at the machine, and- Pantheon, Whittier
and Miss Meadowes added to the confusion by in-
dulging m circus tricks. At the word “go” the
lavorite was turned side on, but he went after the
held though left several lengths. Whittier was in
iront at the back of the course, and half a mile
,°m hon ' e he and The Night Patrol were eight
engths ahead of the others. Ben Chaffey’s horse
soon settled The Night Patrol, and, though Pantheon
was catching him at the finish, lie won by half a length
irom the much improved English horse, with Heroic
who hung out over the last 100 yards, third, three
lengths away. Miss Meadowes was fourth and Lily-
pond last. It was a great performance on Whittier’s
part to lead all the way with 9st. 121 b. on his back,
and the. time, lmin. 53sec., was good.
Spearer (5 to 2) was a strong order for the
Bond Cup. He was last early, but ran up to the
leader, Beau Fils, just before the turn, and looked
like winning, but he couldn’t come bn, and Bel-
gamba (14’s), finishing with a great run, beat
vaibee (16’s) by a neck, with Gungool, who also
ran on impressively, a length and a half away in
tmrd place. Beau Fils and Spearer were together
iourth. The winner, who is a three-vear-old colt
by Poitrel—Bunee, belongs to Stuart Brunton; he
carried 7st. lllb. and ran the 12 furlongs in
2mm. 32Jsec. With a 71b. penalty he will have
7st. 131 b. in the Australian Cup, and he is now a
strong fancy for the long race at Flemington.
Blackadder (lOst. 121 b.), backed at the last minute
trom an outside price to 5 to l, won the first division
m the Salisbury Welter easily from Goble (6’s) and
Beeline (33’s) ; and in the second division Olola, a
<-to-4 favorite, scored his third sucessive victory,
Ouragan and Pentola being in the places. With only
two favorites successful in seven events, MrShortodds
had much the better of his contention with the mob.
The day was darkened by a tragedy, Colin Boyd
dying in a private hospital after a bad fall on
Bindweed in the Warrein Hurdle. There was no
better-liked jockey in Victoria than Bovd, who won
the Grand National Hurdle on Jnllundur and Will
Comfort, the Australian Hurdle on Polygamist the
Australian Steeple on Caibye and Kinlark and the
Onkaparinga Steeple on Miss Rosslyn. He also had
numerous successes on the flat, it was his fate to
meet his death in the very race in which, as a
boy of 16, he had his first mount on a metropolitan
course.
“T.D.”; Poor Colin Boyd could discreetly draw
the line between friendship and business. I got to
know him well when he made his first trip across
Bass Strait for the 1923 Tasmanian Fortnight, and
we met each morning at Elwick, where 1 reported
the gallops for the now defunct World. Engaged to
ride Binbi in the Hobart Cup, he gave, her a final
trial two days before the race. “Lumbered along
as though she had lOst. up!’’ I wrote in the paper.
“Your judgment’s bad,” Colin commented. “You're
two stone out!” With that I informed a confiding
public that the mare hadn’t a million-to-one chance,
and so I thought. But, before she was saddled up,
Boyd said, “You’d better have a quid or two on this
—*it looks good.” “But” I protested. “Never
mind butting,” he went on. “You were wrong
about the weight on Monday: she carried twelve
stone!” Binbi paid B’s on the tote.
The V.A.T.C. Futurity Stakes, to be run next
Saturday, is always a tricky race, but unless Man-
fred (9st. 61b.) has gone off as a result of the
two very severe races he had in the spring, he
should win. Imported Tarquin (7st. 31b.) may be
the Derby colt’s most dangerous opponent, and Fuji
San (9st. 101 b.) and Laveuse (Bst. 21b.) will prob-
ably run well.

Form worked out pretty well at tlie Rose,
hill (N.S.W.) Club’s February meeting, which was
spread over two days—in the 10-furlong handicaps
at any rate. The first of these principal events went
to Greendale (5 s), who had won at Mooreficld
(incidentally, he is not an importation but was bred
in Queensland by E. F. Jillett), and who had to
survive a protest after his perhaps lucky defeat of
the favorite, Samoan. In Saturday’s race Greendale
did not start, and Samoan (5 to 2) won handily,
being followed home by Varney, Confusion (both
10’s), the mystery horse Mingelo (7 to 4) and
Moisha (B’s), who was knocked back from second to
nearly, last but came again. Samoan, who was ridden
by Hunter the second time, is a five-year-old chestnut
gelding by Lily veil— Guard Samoa. Owned by W.
B. Foote and trained by Dan Lewis, he is a lean but
hardy customer who runs on well in all his races,
and with the light weight he is pretty sure to get he
might be worth remembering for the Sydney Cup,
■which was landed last year by the most famous of
Lily veil’s progeny, Lilypond. The White. Diamond,
for which this page has rather a fancy, collected a
Maiden Handicap at 7 to 1, after 12’s had been
laid; and Beauford’s half-brother Ananibah, w.io is
likely to be an early fancy for the Doncastrr (as
also is Honan, whose chance was ruined at the start),
boat a fair field of sprinters in the seven-furlong
Dundas Handicap, going out favorite at a shade of
odds on. And followers of 1. H. Andrews’s stable had
a good settling over imported Biblos, who, backed
from 15’s to 7 to 2, beat Cajole and Hit pointless
in a seven-furlong Welter. This is another Doncaster
possibility if Andrews can get him to the posjt in
satisfactory shape. Several outsiders and one skinner
(Kedgeree, who returned a £5O 14s. div. on the 10s.
tote) enabled McShortodds to show his customary
profit.

“Shrewsbury”: Racegoing in England was
always a fairly risky enterprise; it must have become
more exciting than ever with the organised
gangs of racecourse “legs” which have sprang up
since the war. The latest news of a body of
Amazons known as “The Forty Elephants” should
strike terror to the boldest punter’s heart, for
thesle hefty ladies have lost no time in putting up
a red-hot record of thugging, robbery with violence
and racecourse bustling. Women are adepts at this
sort of manhandling when they take to it in real
earnest, as anyone who has lived in a Lancashire
mill-town will testify. It is. or was, a convention
with the damsels employed in the mills to deal
with any unprotected male caught in their swarming

Rinks at knock-off. The average lad in Bolton or
Burnley, or a dozen other places, would sooner face
a pit full of devils than be caught in a mill-girl
crowd in a back street and the dusk of a winter
evening.
“Bris”: Something ought to be done to
owners who handicap their horses with jaw-breaking
names. A recent winner in Brisbane figures in the
Ricebooly as Kavglveross. Of course he isn’t called
that- ‘ Kaval what you call it” is as near as most
punters can get to his name. He was an outsider
when he won, and even his backers were unable to
get their torgues round his name so as to cheer
him on at the finish.
“Kerys”: Randwick never gives me the
thrill 1 used to get at Orakei, outside Auckland
(M.L.), before an unsympathetic Government stepped
in and spoiled the fun. At the Orakei meetings
dusky wahines sat round smoking pipes, Maori bookies
sported enormous bags— carpet and otherwise—there
were innumerable dogs, there was store of dried shark,
and water melon;, and pigs grunted contentedly along"
the course. The winning-post was a stout Maori
armed with a flag. As the field careered towards
him, punters encouraging their animals with sticks
and sods, he would run with surprising agility
aci oss. country, and stop with unerring judgment
alongside the horse in which he was interested,
which steed, with much flag-waving, he would
declare the winner. I once happened to be on a nag
that “won,” and with sundry other optimists made
an effort to collect my dues. Henare gazed earnestly
into his capacious pouch and, after a prolonged
scrutiny, announced “I no pay this time.” “Why
not?” demanded the indignant speculators. “No
money,” said Henare, with decision. “But you must
pay,” urged the punters in chorus. “We must
have our money.” “How I pay when I not got te
money?” asked Henare, with deadly reasoning,
“Ropata, he porrow it.” The audience demanded an
explanation. “He puy te peer,” admitted Henare,
defensively. “Well,” we shouted, clutching at a
final chance of satisfaction, ' “where’s the beer?”
“He trink it,” /aid Henare. That seemed to settle

“Machete”: There was a reversal of form
at Wellington (M.L.) when the Dominion’s distance
champion, Randolph Rose, beat Lloyd Hahn (U.S.A.)
over a mile in 4min. 26 8-ssec. On the previous
Saturday the American had defeated Rose at Master-
ton, over the same distance, in Bsecs. better time.
There was a strong wind blowing, which may have
troubled the visitor. More likely the going was
heavy, for Hahn’s travelling mate, Jackson Scholz,
took 10 2-ssec.,to win the 100 yards, and 22 2-ssec.
for the 220 yards—funeral figures for him.

If Stadiums, Ltd., paid George Fox’s fare
from Britain it was ill-advised. George is a brother
of Joe Pox, sometime British featherweight champion,
but matched against George White (9st. 1351 b.),
to whom he tried to concede 411 b., he gave a most
inglorious display at Melbourne*Stadium. He clung
tenaciously to White for four rounds, apparently
having no stomach for the business on hand. In the
fifth he was looking for a soft spot, and, taking
one high ud oh the cheek-bone, he lay prone while
10 was counted. Better things were expected of
abo. Billv Samuels (10st. 41b.) and Dave Palmer
(9?t. 1211 b.), who had put in such a stirring fight
a few weeks back. But Palmer was felled by a
glancing right in the second round and counted out
while unsuccessfully appealing for a foul.

“Hothnm”: London Daily Herald has
stepped aside from its usual political paths to casti-
gate so-called amateurs of lawn tennis who demand
excessive hotel and travelling expenses, extort fees
for using specific brands of balls and rackets, enter
into arrangements with film companies, have “under-
standings” in regard to appearances at gate-money
tournaments, write articles for newspapers, and so
on. We have had examples of this sort of thing in
Australia, and may expect more of it as long as
clubs and associations pander to the drawing power
of alleged lilywhites whose displays swell the gate
receipts. Cabled accounts of the tremendous betting
on the game which has been prevalent at recent
French tournaments hint at still another danger.
Where betting is a recognised accompaniment to a
sport, the most rigid supervision and control have
always been found necessary to keep that sport
even ostensibly clean.

“Harold Hardupp”: A mutual enthusiasm
for fishing started and fostered an acquaintance
between Blobbs, a prosperous Sydneyite, and an un-
prosperous one, Blibbs; and, when the wealthy rod-
man learned that the other wanted a job, he resolved
t<» provide one. But he was careful, and asked for
personal references. Blibbs named Blithers, whom
Blobbs knew, and Blithers spoke heartily of Blibbs
over the telephone. To Blithers, however, came a
note in which the cautious Blobbs asked: ‘‘Re Blibbs ;
would you mind putting your opinion of him in
writing ?” The note went back with a scrawl at
the foot: “Blibbs is a fisherman, but he is quite
trustworthy otherwise.’’

There was a rumpus in Adelaide after
Frank Doyle (N.S.W.) had been declared winner of
the 100 yards Australian championship
at the City Baths. The final was a
ding-dong battle between Doyle and
Queenslander Reg Grier, who was
beaten by a touch in time that equalled
Norman Ross’s record for the baths,
57 3-ssec. An appeal on the ground
of interference was immediately lodged
by Grier’s friends; but the referee,
apparently dismissing it, allowed
Doyle to be announced -as winner.
Later on the appeal was uphold and
a re-swim ordered, w'hereupon the
N.S.W. manager sent hissing-hot
messages to Sydney, and the N.S.W.
Association was urged to carry the
matter to the Amateur Swimming
Union. The re-swim was nevertheless
held, Doyle again boating Grier bv a
touch ; the time was f>Bsec., and Car-
berry was a close third. Moss Christie
won the threequarter-mile champion-
ship from “Brusher” Jones (W.A.)
and E. Cormack (Vic.) in 18min. 3sec.
He will have the right to call himself
threequarter-mile champion when his
knees are gouty, for the event is to
be dropped.
“Wink”: How to score safely and rapidly
from Liddicut’s extreme off-theory has always been
a problem for Melbourne batsmen. Only the most
agile and reckless would chance the slips and dash
across for a hit as the fireman’s deliveries flashed
past Russell Watson, of St. Kilda, has shown them
a safe way. Taking block two feet outside the off
he knocked biddy’s stuff all over the field,
the Jntzroy man occasionally beat him with a full-
toss aimed at the leg stump, but bowling at the
wicket was such a novelty for Liddicut that everv
such delivery missed the sticks.
* * * *
“Hotham”: It is a curious feature of the
cricket of to-day that the fast bowler of real class
is almost as rare a bird as the flying pig. This
is especially the case in England, which not so many
years ago could produce such topnotchers as Lock-
wood, Richardson, Brearley, Knox, Kortright and
Mold. Things are so bad in the Old Dart that some
of the experts are seriously discussing a trial in the
Tests for the Victorian G. O. Allen, now at Cam-
bridge. Allen has already played with the Gentle-
men against the Players, and is reported to be as
fast as any bowler in England nowadays. He is a
good bat and an excellent field. But the said experts
must be ignorant of Allen’s being an Australian or
unmindful of the Sammy Woods precedent. When
the 1888 Australian team was up against it, an SOS
was sent to Sammy, then at Cambridge, and Samuel
played for his country in the three Tests, besides a
few minor matches. But he wasn’t very successful.
He took 11 wickets for 298, averaging' 27.09, and
made 54 in 10 innings, highest score 18. <

“Cedric”: Touching Clem Hill’s replace-
ment of Jack Harry in the 1896 Australian XI.
(B. 11/2/ 26). After the selectors had picked the
team Hill, who was only 18, made a wonderful
206 for S.A. against N.S.W., scoring 154 of the
last 197 runs. The selectors thereupon decided that
he should go in place of Harry, who, it was dis-
covered, had injured his kneecap, though medical
opinion differed. Harry received £l6O compensation.
He left for England a week after the team sailed,
having got a job as ground bowler to the M.C.C.
Really he was a bit past his prime, and he never
did much in England.

“Past Grammar”: British Rugby author!
ties are profiting by past experience, for, in inviting
a N.S.W. team to tour Britain and France in 1927-28,
thev have announced that they will pay all expenses
and take all the profits. It was not ever thus, for
when the Maoriland Native team, the first “Colonial”
players to visit the homeland, went over in 1888-89
they had to shift for themselves and be content with
a gate percentage. They had a pretty stiff time
of it, too, having literally to “play their way”
from town to town, like a theatrical co. in the
“smalls.” The 1905 All Blacks paid their own exes,
and took most of the gate, as did the Wallabies
of 1908. Both cleaned up a handsome profit
that Britain had a change of heart. The 1924-25
All Black received expenses only, and the British
Unions had a glorious cut up, save Scotland, which
stayed out and has probably been sorry ever since.

“Lond.”: The level way in which English
Soccer form is thrashed out under the promotion-and-
deposition system of clubs in the League is Shown
in the plaeings at mid-season, beginning of January.
Woolwich Arsenal, clear leaders for the moment, with
24 matches played (2 points for a win, and 1 for a
tie), had only 31 points; it seems incredible that
an average only a bit better than a tie for each
game should be the best in sight. Huddersfield, 22
matches, 29 points, had a possibly better position.
In the Second League there was not quite such a
level standing, Derby County, 23 for 35, being clearly
the best in sight.
THE CANDID FRIEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
“Kelleway confirms the announcement that he has
been engaged by the London Daily Express to
report the Australian team’s tour of England. He
disclaims all idea of personal animus against any-
one and says he will do his duty without fear or
favor.”
He will not drive along the shirt-front swards
Of Leeds or Nottingham or lordly Lords
The sort of ball that makes the batsman glad.
That luxury’s reserved for other men,
The while he merely drives a fountain-pen
Across a writing-pad.
’Twill not be his upon the splice to sit
And potter round while other fellows hit
Or get their wickets scattered endways. But
There may be things to compensate for that;
The pen is sometimes mightier than the bat—•
Especially to cut.
Victim of favoritism or caprice,
He may not amble to the bowling crease
And show his mastery of swerve and spin.
Caught in the grip of—call it circumstance,
Withal, if so inclined, he’ll have a chance
To sling some hot ones. in.
Hero of many a hardly battled Test,
And shelved, inexplicably, at his best
And deadliest, there seems a certain blend
Of justice here. Regard it how you will,
Who is there half as well equipped to fill
The role of Candid Friend?

before the year is out.
“Aleikum”: L. V. Biggs, who was once
chief of staff of Melbourne Age, has left the
organising secretaryship of the iSational
Federation to rejoin the Symes. He is to
take Roy Bridges’s job of literary editor.
One of Brisbane’s best-known literary
figures, Steele Rudd, goes to Sydney to carry

“Ricardo”: John Norton lived in perpetual
feud with the compositors who mis-set his
screaming copy. Into one of his diatribes
against authority he dragged the Thirty
Tyrants of Athens, and the intelligent comp,
made it the “Trusty Tyrants.” I corrected
the proof and sent it back. A little later
a howl of anguish rose from th.e inner office
and John burst out waving the revise in the
air. “Look at this!” he cried. “ ‘The
Thirsty Tyrants’! The blanks can’t think of
anything but beer!”
“Ricardo”: Irvine Perel, a Bananaland
journalist, has owned and conducted his
Patriot for 33 years. He started it at Bun-
daberg in 1893, and after several shifts about
the country brought it to Brisbane, where it
has been running as a Sunday paper ever
since. An enthusiastic Labor man in the
early days of the movement, Perel has been
disillusioned in these later years, and what
he thinks of present-day Labor leaders
almost scorches the paper. He was a member
of the “Suicide Club” w T hieh abolished the

George Black, -who left a sub-editor’s desk

material with which to make a history of the

It is to be issued in 12 parts at a shilling

prosperous business around his hobby. He
first rode a bike when it was still a curiosity,
and he has kept on riding for 40 years, utilis-
ing every improvement as fast as it came.
It was natural, as the bike became popular,
that its devotees should go to the shop of
the man who specialised in cyclists’ outfits
and sold a cyclists’ map of N. S. Wales for
their guidance, even when they required
things not associated with cycling.

Argus more than 25 years ago ; the former
was then a star city roundsman. Subse-
quently he became descriptive writer on the

Davidson left the Argus to join the Mel-

“Hartog”: Literary thieves run in all
shapes. I remember a faded-looking young
man with Mona Lisa features who blew into
the office of the R. R. Times (Ballina),
then conducted by the late Thomas Temper-
ley and reeled out a hard-luck story. T.T.
was always willing to assist a lame dog.
especially if he was a writing hound, and
suggested that the visitor should do an
article for the paper, trnter in the day the
wilted pen-pusher turned up with a wad of
copy; and T.T., after glancing at it over
the top of his blue spectacles, came to light
with a sovereign. The dolorous features of
the visitor had turned radiant as he left the
office, and T.T. afterwards confided to me
that the article was full of fine thoughts,
finely expressed, and that a chap with the
ability to write like that ought not to be
tramping about the country. It was a
stickybeak resident who had nothing to do
but loaf about the School of Arts and
read the English periodicals who destroyed
T.T.’s equanimity by rudely demanding
what he meant by publishing an article from
the Spectator under the misleading an-
nouncement “Written for the R. R. Times.”
After that any wandering scribe who blew
into the office was requested to w r rite his
contribution at the office table.
SONG OF A SONG,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There’s a bird on the tree;
And perhaps I am wrong,
But he seems to mock me
With the trick of his song:
With his song of the hills,
Of the far and the free—
Oh the music he spills
In the cold heart of me 1
And I fancy he winks —
Though maybe I am wrong—
At the poor fool that thinks
Little words make a song.

“Are You a Mason ?” was written a quarter
of a century ago by Leo Dietrichstein, but
the old frivolity has been revised by someone
whose idea of revising is to emphasise the
motley. Moreover, the company at Syd-
ney Opera House on Saturday lived up to
the belief that broad farce is the best policy;
and roars of appreciation from a crowded
bouse gave the somewhat crude belief a justi-
fication. The plot, or tangle, which is new
to this generation, concerns the imposture
of two men, Frank Perry and his father-in-
law, Amos Bloodgood, who, to hide gay do-
ings from their womenfolk and secure free-
dom for nigjits-out when they are supposed
to be at craft meetings, .pose as Masons.
Neither knows of the other’s duplicity; and
with the aid of much cheerful lying, some
friends and a blackmailing thespian the
pair get themselves into such a mesh of
trouble that, in Act 111, dynamite seems to
offer the only way out. Somewhere after half-
past 10, however, the only man who really is
a Mason shows real brotherhood in explain-
ing that all the absurdities were only a test
put upon a simple-minded country man (Jef-
ferson Tait) to ascertain whether he is
worthy of admission to the order; whereupon
the cast sorts itself out into five kissing
couples for the curtain-fall.
* * * *
Bertie Wright, as Amos Bloodgood, used
an amazing amount of energy in displaying
such consternation at some of the develop-
ments of the plot that the inability of a
suspicious wife to immediately detect his

imposture was amazing. It is said that an
actor who found he was not getting all the
laughter that Falstaff should bring once im-
proved the part by standing the fat knight
on his head, an act which earned vociferous
approval. Wright showed a cheerful pre-
paredness to stand upon his head twice, if
need be, to please an audience which thor-
oughly approved of him. Maurice Tuohy
was the son-in-law who also wasn’t a Mason,
and Frank Neil the pal whose suggestions
always make matters worse. To help his
friend, Neil made up as a most unbelievable
girl, and his representation of girlishness
was unnecessarily broad. Lily Molloy
played a broad-comedy slavey—with topical
references to the 44-liour week and other
union matters—briskly; Field Fisher made
the stagey thespian a good study; Miss Bet-
terton Glover maintained a suitable attitude
of asperity as Bloodgood’s wife; and,
amongst the others, Rosa Duggan gave her
lines —mainly love-passages—brightly.

The only thing likely to shift “Give and

Renee Kelly is due to arrive during March,
the laughter-maker’s run is of necessity

Some day a bemused member of the
Sydney Tivoli audience will rise up and
tell the Karreys that they are liars; for
the manner in which they contort themselves
is quite impossible. Yet their india-rubber
body-twistings are done with such ease that
their performance does not set the teeth on
edge like some such acts which do not go
half as far. It is certainly an extraordinary
turn. Rosemary and Sylvia display dainty
crinolined dresses in which one of them
uses a voice not at all remarkable, yet sweet
as the old songs she sings. Sylvia (if the
other is Rosemary) whistles in a birdlike
manner on occasions when her partner is
letting her voice rest for a new effort—
altogether a pretty little act. Another new
arrival is a golden-haired lady with a gun
and the name of Rosie, who, from all sorts
of positions, shoots with precision at small
targets hanging around the head and anat-
omy of a well-nerved male partner. Ella
Shields has taken an extra week to finish
her season, and the Old Minstrel Show fills
half the programme wfith songs and quips
that don’t give quite the satisfaction of the
first lot.

Even members of the No-hat Brigade may
be convinced that there is good use for hats
after seeing Bert Elliott, now at Fullers’
(Sydney) ; it may comfort them, though, to
note that the slick juggler believes that '"its
were made for any use but wearing. Per-
haps the quantity of silk lids he utilises —
and utilises very well —on the stage explains
where the undertakers’ assistants now get
their dilapidated headgear. Eileen Fleury
is a sprightly comedienne; and Jim Gerald
calls his co.’s frivolity of this week “Don’t
Tell the Wife.” It tells very well with the
audience, although Gerald seems to be more
sober when he’s drunk than when he's
sober.
% * *
The feminine author’s touch is blatant in
the melodramatic “Judgment of the. Storm,”
in which much hysteric heart-throb is worked
to paint a stodgy moral and reach a trite
tail. It is one of the two main pic-
tures at the Sydney Lyceum, the other being
“The Street of Forgotten Men,” a somewhat
depressing close-up of the armies of hale
men who are prepared to live upon cadging
and anything else but hard work in New
York, with interlarded incidents to show
that the parasites carry something be-
sides fleas under their rags. Harpist “Bertie”
Torzillo, assisted by Elsie Peerless, produces
soothing minstrelsy during the interval.
Hoyt’s De Luxe has the “Best Bad Man,” in
which Tom Mix, disguised for a time as a
vendor of musical instruments and saxo-
phones, provides the usual breeziness; but
the scoundrels for whose benefit the disguise
is adopted are evidently not picture-fans, or
they would recognise Tom without delay. The
rest of the programme shows things done “In
the Name of Love.” Zangwill’s “We
Moderns” is turned from bright farce into
dreary pictorial preaching in a film version
shown at the Strand; Colleen Moore, like-
able enough when she smiles, is merely de-
pressing in sorrow. “The Iron Horse” is to
follow “Scaramouclie” at the Prince
Edward : and a fortnight ahead of the first
screening the management has thrown on«n
the box-office for advance booking—a sign
of the new frills the picture business is
wearing.
* * * *
“The Honeymoon Girl,” which Sydney
suffered more or lesg gladly for four weeks in
the middle of last year and which came to
Melbourne for the first time on Saturday
night—it is at the Priucess —fails to inspire
any more respect in the present incarnation
than it did at its first appearance. Seldom
have six perspicacious playwrights and
heavenly composers conspired together to
bring into this hard world such an anaemic
giglot. In Sydney the Girl’s affairs were en-
trusted to the reasonably capable hands of
Mark Daly, May Beatty aqd Mamie Watson,
among others. On Saturday a new crowd
did their best and brightest by her. For not
letting the invalid become a cot-case from
the beginning, Jimmy Godden deserves the
thanks of the management plus a daily bath
of sparkling Moselle. As the “boots” of the
Hotel des iPalmes he purveyed his comedy
(Jnost of which has already been borrowed
without asking by small revue shows oper-
ating on the vaudeville circuits) like a sage
stage warrior. He drew all the laughs that
weren’t produced by the others for for-
getting their lines. Madge White is also
to be commended. As a naughty Russian
danseuse she exploited pleasantly a nimble
figure, a light singin r voice and an accent
that came from Moscow via Paris and
Shaftesbury-avenue. Polly Power invested
the hotel bureau with bodily charm, altliougn
her notes would scarcely disturb the echoes
of a thimble. The rest is mainly sorrow, it
not silence. George Jennings was as dull a
General Zonzo as well could be invented.
“THE HONEYMOON GIRL ,” AT
MELBOURNE PRINCESS.
Madge White, a Russian dancer, vamps the
impressionable Les Pearce on his wed-
ding night.
Charlton Morton shrugged his shoulders
through the part of the hotel manager, and
Winifred Dalle, although her voice has
quality, made the defection of her affianced
husband Leslie Pearce entirely plausible. The
last-named, although out of his innards
emerges a voice of some depth and sweetness,
is a hero of romance built by Dorman, Long
and Co. to plans and specifications by Dr.
Bradfield. Much may be said in favor of
the local chorus, although the opening ballet
was as crude an effort in sexual allure as
anything devised by the sacred ballet-master
of the Witchetty grub totem at Alice Springs.
* * * *
The plot concerns itself with tlie approach-
ing nuptials.of Leslie Pearce with Winifred
Dalle, which Madge White, the aforesaid
Russian dancer, interrupts. The interrup-
tion has no dramatic consequences beyond
breaking up a wedding-breakfast which is
tedious enough to deserve the severest
pulverising. A general migration to a chat-
eau specially built for honeymoons provides
Madge White, George Jennings and Jimmy
Goddcn with a motive for a breezy song,
Edna Saunderson and Roy MacDonnel with
space for a dance, and the interrupted nup-
tials with an opportunity for reconciliation.
The masterpiece is presumably one of those
which that bulwark of the nation against
the moral depravity of N’York and the bad
art of London, Hugh J. Ward, selected after
long thought, rigorous fasting, prayer and
bodily chastisement. We will have to take
his distinguished word for it that it was
the best of a rotten lot.

A Melbourne premiere: —
In the calm atmosphere of his studio, E. Buck-
master, who is having a first show at the Athenaeum,
Melbourne, draws with care : and sobriety. Half a
dozen pencil drawings and some excellent charcoal
portraits advertise his sound technique. When he
gets out into the air, however, he becomes drunk
with light and color' and his forms are shaken with
• attacks of hiccups. In this mood of bacchanalian
frenzy he h.as hardly started on one picture when
new beauties in the passing clouds have made him
rush off frantically to start another. “The Morning
Sun,” is a drinking chorus to the luminary, and in
No. 55, depicting some factory chimneys dimly
seen across a river, he has had a fling at the ugliness
of industry. He has soberer moments sometimes, and
then he turns out Corot-like bits of loveliness such
as “Blue Haze,” and No. 59, “A Gleam from
the Sun.” His portraits in oil are ambitious. The
lady in No. 6 appears to be having difficulty in
breathing, as well she might, since the artist has
forgotten to surround her with an atmosphere; but
John Shirlow is there with a good deal of intensity
and the portrait of “A.S.” is distinctly clever.
In these days, when promising young artists usually
merge into poster-kings or dress-designers, it is
dangerous to prophesy; but if there is any future
for valorous young Falstaffs, E. Buckmaster should
share in it.

2Stk Nov., 1923.
Messrs. Crossley Motors (Aust.), Ltd.,

Dear Sirs, —
I have been driving my “Crossley” Car, 15/30 11. P.,
for 12 months, and have covered 10,000 miles on all
classes of roads.
During that time I have travelled through South
Australia, New South Wales and Victoria on private
and official business, and up till now I have not had
occasion to take a tool out of the case nor been held
up through engine or tyre trouble.
It will interest you to know that on the South
Australian trip I covered 1500 miles, carefully check-
ing and measuring the petrol, and I averaged for the
total distance 29 miles to the gallon; on one section,
from Melbourne to Hamilton, 200 miles, I averaged
32 miles per gallon.
I have only just arrived from Melbourne, and I feel
sure you will be pleased to know we had no trouble of
any sort, and the engine is still running beautifully.
Yours faithfully,
H. W. JAMES,
President of the National Roads Association,

Dear Six's, —
It gives me pleasure to subscribe to the general
efficiency and all-round dependability of the 15/30
H.P. “Crossley.”
As you know, it is 15 months since this firm first
purchased a “Crossley” Car, and it was not until this
car had been on. the road continuously for 12 months
that we had it overhauled.
There were no mechanical defects, and it was the
condition of this car that decided us to standardise
on Crosslcys throughout.
The new model appears to be even supei’ior to last
year's, and if we get the same service from the new
cars that we obtained from the old one we shall be
very satisfied.

I find after two years' dailfcy use, dunvg which period
I have covered a distance of slightly ov<V 30,000 miles,
that the car is just as gooct as when purchased.
During the period mentione d repairs ha\\a been prac-
tically nil.
Four other cars I have liad during tlh' past ten
years after about the sam e running distance were
worn out and disposed of.

lons petrol, and covered a distance, city and sifimrban
running, averaging about 50 shops daily, of 750 miles,
31 1-5 miles per gallon. Ode country run to Rraid-
wood and the South Coast, .miles per gallon. This
is ordinary driving, without any special attention! I
consider it remarkable for a car of its yize. A test
of this kind is, in my mind, "the only <me of any
benefit to the ordinary user.
Anyone needing a reliable and .comfortable'.car, with
plenty of speed, economical as to petrol and tyres and
repairs, will find your 15/30 much cheaper, in spits
of the slightly greater first tost, than most of th V much-
boosted cheaper cars on the Australian marl.'et; at
any rate, such is my experience—ic short, I cc vsider
the car worthy of the reputation oC the world-i’amed

“Caesar’s Ghost” : Another venture in the
picture business is to be made by H. N.
Southwell, who went to London some
years ago. Southwell, on that trip, took
with him a film story of the Kelly gang
which did good business in Britain; and he
now holds a contract from an English
picture-house to make six Australian pictures
for £lB,OOO. Perth is to be his location.
Melbourne will shortly have an epidemic
of new shows. Beresford Fowler, indomit-
able purveyor of highbrow drama, is
breaking out on February 22 in a
fash of intellectual plays, including
Shaw’s “ Candida, ” Ibsen’s “ Master
Builder” and Houghton’s “Hindle Wakes,”
a piece that raised the dust of controversy
when it was first presented in the Cold
Land and has since done well on the screen.
Fowler’s first offering will be “Rutherford
and Son,” which was his most meritorious
effort last year. Following on his heels
comes Dion Boucicault, who opens on March
20 in a Barrie series with Mary Hinton
(Mrs. Pitt Rivers) in some of the leading
roles. Pavlova is in the offing and Chalia-
pine just over the skyline.
“Strict Vegetarian”: At St. Kilda (Vic.)
the other day a movie temple which some-
times held 3500 worshippers went up in
smoke in the space of a few minutes. So
sudden was the destruction that the few
workmen engaged about the building ouly
just escaped with their lives. It happened
to be the one afternoon in the week when
a matinee was not in progress. This is
what the chief fire-brigade officer thought
about it: “Had the fire occurred when a
picture show was in progress the loss of
life must have been appalling. In the city
itself the building regulations would not.
allow such a building to be erected on any
conditions. So people come to a place like
St. Kilda, where the building regulations are
a farce, and erect these flimsy death-traps.”
Profiteering councils allow this sort of, thing
in what they consider the best interests of
their suburbs.
“Hamfat”: Governor-General Stonehaven,
while in Hobart, let Allan Wilkie know that
he was wanted at Government House, and,
getting him there, pinned the 0.8. E. on his
manly breast as an indication that the per-
formance of Shakspeare is regarded as a
national service. It is to hoped that
Wilkie won’t allow himself, to be carried
away by tlie distinction ; a Henry V. with
the 0.8. E. ribbon showing on his bosom as
he urges his army of three or four visible
characters once more into the breach, or a
Mark Antony showing the same decoration
as he requests, the citizens of Rome to lend
him their ears, would look out of place.
It would also be out of place for Hamlet
in an abstracted moment to cogitate “To be
or 0.8. E.”
“Semibreve”: A definite step towards the
production of opera on repertory lines has
been taken by members of the Sydney Reper-
tory Theatre Society; as a result, the Sydney
Civic Opera Society has been formed. It
is proposed to rope in 750 subscribers and
then attempt such productions as Rimsky-
Korsakoff’s “Golden Cockerel,” Gluck's
“Orpheus,” “The Immortal Hour” and “The
Magic Flute.” There has been incautipus
mention of the fact that Sydney Con.’s pro-
duction of “The Marriage of Figaro,” which
ran to five performances, cost £540, although
there were no fees for conductors or singers
and half the members of the orchestra were
amateurs. But in Melbourne the purely
amateur Victorian Opera Society manages to
put on periodical performances of opera;
and, although its early performances were
rather ragged, it has been able to buy scen-
ery and costumes out of its profits.
“Alwyn”: Harry Skinner, an old-time
Sydney showman, had the first phonograph
heard in Australia. Exhibited in the Strand
Arcade, Sydney, crowds flocked to see and
hear the marvel. Long, thin rubber tubes
were held to the ear, and tinny tunes were
eagerly listened to at a sprat a time. It
was in the Backblocks, however, that the
talking-machine created the greatest sensa-
tion. The first to be heard outside the
metropolis belonged to a since-dead N.S.W.
Leg. Councillor, who leased it to a young
Maorilander named Lundon, whose phono-
graph became the star attraction of Will
and Jim Riley’s touring variety show. Jim
Riley and Lundon have long since passed
out, but Will Riley is still on deck and in
the furniture trade at Redfern.
“Gard”: I wish Ward success with his
purchase of “Abie’s Irish Rose,” but not even
NOT HER LINE.
MAISIE : "No Bobbie James tool you to supper last evening. How many times did he
kiss you, darling ?”
DAISIE: "I'm sure I forget, dearest. I’m a dancer, not an accountant.”
a four-year run in N’ Yark makes me optimistic
that this Yiddish comedy will set Sydney Har-
bor aflame. When I saw the play in December
it looked like going on for another four years,
and a systematic “drive” was being inaug-
urated with the idea of making it a national
institution. But, not being interested in
the smoothing out of Jewish and Irish racial
feelings in Amurka’s melting-pot, I found the
thing tedious. Two stubborn fathers, con-
ventional Jewish and Irish stage types, spend
the evening trying to prevent the marriage
of young Abie with the colleen who has won
his heart, and into the mouths of a rabbi
and a priest are put lines of maudlin senti-
ment, laid on so thickly that even skilled
actors can’t disguise their artificiality. Ward
will have to recast some of the absurd
speeches if the play is to succeed here. By
the way, old friend Andrew Mack, grown
grey and heavy, is the Irish pa in the Broad-
way production.
“jA.G.M.” (Loud.) : The last week of 1925
was made notable by a very fine revival of
“Henry VIII.” by Sybil Thorndike at the
Empire, hitherto closely associated with
tinsel and frivolity. Miss Thorndike s hus-
band, Lewis Casson, was the producer; and
the stage settings, which have won great
praise, were by Charles Ricketts, A.R.A.,
who invested the whole scheme with a Hol-
bein spirit. All the fine passages were nobly
dealt with by Miss Thorndike as Katharine,
Norman Norman as Henry, and Lyall Swete
as Wolsey, though there were moments when
Mr. Swete’s Cardinal seemed less than the
strong man who ruled England at a strenu-
ous period-—this Cardinal was greater in liis
downfall than in his might. Joachim said
of Melba’s voice that it was small in a small
hall, and large in a large one. Something
the same can be said of Sybil Thorndike.
In a poor play she cannot be convincing; in
a great scene she is a great actress. Nearly
a decade ago she played Katharine at the
Old Vic., but her later work shows a great
advance on the achievement of that day.
And her voice is becoming more mellow and
resonant. She is much better suited in this
production than she was in Shaw’s “Joan,”
though in the latter she made enough money
to warrant a life of ease for herself and her
family. Instead of accepting any such luxu-
rious path, she has determined to risk much
in the production of Shakspeare’s historic
plays in a series of pageants of which this
“Henry” is the first. On the opening night
she got a tremendous reception from a
packed house, and the forward business is
excellent.
“Sehnorrer” : When in England not long
ago Sam Cohen, a leader of Sydney Jewry,
approached a leading London entrepreneur
regarding a concert at which Helene Esser-
, , T , ... ,
man could make her London debut, 'the
great man said he would be charmed to
arrange the affair, but he counselled delay.
Ihe critics would come along and tear her
“ K i| ie lier to a Hl ~ llKea

ls the way some oi our stars are made.
Hamfat : From the managerial point of
view 7 , the most delightful show-town I ever
visited was Taihape (M.L.). Encouraged
by a deputation of Taihapians who visited
our show at Mangaweka, we coached it. to
their fastness over a frightful road and found
it to consist of two small pubs and a multi-
tude of tents. But the inhabitants were lios-
pitality itself. “Don’t sell any bob tickets,”
we were told—the crowd would be glad enough
to pay 2s. 6d. and 4s. At those prices we
got houses that made us prepared to meet
cheerfully the extravagant hotel charges of
which wc had been warned. But there was
no extortion; both publicans mentioned that
their charge for theatricals was five bob a
that the matter of drinks had been
‘fixed a self-appointed local committee had
arranged that. We drank deep with the com-
mittee until the coach left in the morning;
and most of us knew nothing of the jolty
journey back until we were wakened in
Mangaweka again.
“Reno’ : Sally Booth and Ada Lee (B.
4/2/’26) were members of the Charles
Arnold co. when they succumbed to bubonic
plague at Sydney in 1902. They had been
inmates of the Criterion Hotel, and the hotel
and theatre were closed by the health authori-
ties for some time; then, other managers
having fought shy of it, Woods-Williamson
came along and got the playhouse at a
peppercorn rent. This tour of Arnold’s was
his last. His principal plays were “What
Happened to Jones” and “The Professor's
Love Story,” and, thanks to “Daddy” Lohr’s
excellent management, he was reported to
have made £20,000. He did not live long to
enjoy it, as, returning to England, he fell
dead one night at the Savage Club. His
only daughter, Edna, married Martin Lewis,
the fair-haired juvenile of Julius Knight's
“Milestones” co. Willoughby (whose associa-
tion with Geach, mentioned by “Hamfat,”
did not begin until several years later) was
a member of the Arnold co., and his first
wife was a member of George Musgrove’s
“Aladdin” panto, co., whose season at the
Royal was also brought to an abrupt con-
clusion by the plague. The Criterion had a
cold time until John Wren acquired the
property some 10 years ago, made extensive
alterations and leased the theatre to J. C.
Williamson, Ltd.
“C.11.G.”: Herbert Clayton and Jack
Waller continue to do well with “Mercenary
Mary” at the Loudon Hippodrome, and Hugh
J. Ward will have the benefit of their Angli-
cised version when he introduces Mary to
the Commonwealth. He will probably keep
the thing in mothballs until the opposition
firm decides to bring out “Rose Marie.”
Billy Rego, disguised behind a yard or two
of whiskers, is a comedy great-grandfather in
the London production of “Mercenary Mary.”
“Mako”: Visiting novelist Zaue Grey is
convinced that the youthful Maorilander has
little to learn from young America in the
matter of smartness. As he sat with a
friend on the beach at Russell, the little
North Auckland township that is the Mecca
of the deep-sea fishermen, a small boy with
an inconspicuous camera stalked the cele-
brity, and managed to snap him unawares.
The youth then raced home, where his
mother developed the film for him. That
night Zane Grey and his party strolled into
the local picture-show, and were astounded
to see their particular star cast on the sheet.
The whole matter couldn’t have been more
neatly and quickly managed by a Noo Yark
go-getter.
“R.Iv.D.N.”: We are shortly to be fav-
ored with a new American play called “The
Seventh Heaven,” written by Austini Strong,
a relation by marriage of Robert Louis
Stevenson. The cast will be headed by
Frank Harvey, and three Australians will
return from long sojourns in Yankeeland to
appear in it—Marion Marcus Clarke, Gwen
Burroughs and James Hughes.
“Goldilocks”: Theatrical people in Sydney
have accepted with something like enthusi-
asm the refrain of a recent Bulletin jingle,
“No wonder the orchestra drinks.” A vaude-
villain on the way back to his dressing-room
met another member of the show to whom he
gleefully remarked that his turn had taken
longer than usual. “It went great!” he said,
elatedly. “I had to go over my last number
twice.” “How did the orchestra take it?”
the other asked. “The orchestra! Why, of
course” - the excited one began; then he
saw chalked on his door the words, “No
wonder the orchestra drinks.” Before he
recovered the gift of language his questioner
had fled downstairs.
“Flaming Youth”: An American picture
magnate, guest of an Australian theatre for
the evening, found his way iifto the place
where the management administers spiritu-
ous consolation for what its guests have to
endure from the stage. While the house-
manager decanted whisky, the great man des-
canted on “the palir of the fillums” to a
critic and one or tw T o others. “The motion-
pitcher,” he said, “is prahbahbly
fahrce in the world to-day.” "You surprise
me by admitting it,” the critic ventured;
“why, then, don’t you put some real art
into it?”
“T. 0.1.”: A friend has lent me a Drury-
lane playbill of the period when E. T. Smith
was lessee and manager. E.T. was father
of Melbourne’s Dr. L. L., who was a circum-
stance in medicine, politics and sport for half
a century. The bill is dated Saturday,
September 24, 1853, and the play was
“Virginius,” with G. V. Brooke in the
name-part. The only member of the com-
pany supporting him who came to Australia
was Mrs. Vickery, who, after a successful
career, died in Russell-street, Melbourne.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mdlle. Caskowiski, the Kamschatkan serio
tragedienne now in Australia, has the most wonderful
eyelashes in the world. They are insured for
2,000,000 zeechins.” —Extract from any up-to-date
theatricdl publicity par.
When stars arrive from other lands
To shed their radiance on our stage,
At home, of course, one understands
Each one has been the season’s rage.
If here we find their methods rough
And signs of genius far to seek,
We own up, readily enough,
They all possess a splendid cheek.
What though the new tragedian’s gasp
A hydroplane’s exhaust recalls,
Or jagged as a shoeing-rasp
The notes the shrieking serio squalls ;
Though looks and voice each mummer lacks,
We all admit without reserve
One thing their propaganda backs—
A really admirable nerve.
How do they manage, you may ask,
These reputations to create
And find it such an easy task
The public’s leg to elongate?
How do they snare the £ s. d.
Though talent no one can descry ?
The answer’s “For publicity
They have a most discerning eye.”

A. :• Not worth the space... .1.Q.P.:
'As attractive as a barrow-load of tripe....
J. J. J.: But “M.G.S.” didn’t represent that as the
belief of the whole group. He specifically said it
was the queer belief of a Javanese “prince”....
Mary M. i- It eats too much space... .H.M.W.: Good
feeling in it'; but the end is cryptic. Might be worth
ro-submitting... .1.A.H.; An article covering the
ground is already in type.... Thermos: Good idea,
poorly handled.... Barney Down: Two jokes stale,
other matter not of sufficient interest.. . .Carton: The
N.S.W. Leg. Councillor got his “Honorable” prefix
this way. In the first year of responsible government
the members of the newly elected Leg. Assembly
spent some time considering how they were to
address not only their own Speaker but the members
of the Upper chamber. It was referred to the
Home authorities, and on January 15, 1857, came a
despatch from her Majesty stating that her pleasure
was that these gentlemen should be “Honorable”....
J.S.C.: No use for “The Immigrant’s Log”; verse
atrocious. D.F. (Strathfield) : Those abstractions
are poor bait for the public’s sixpences.. . .0.W.P.:
The verse is rather terrifying. .. .Eleanora: Several
furlongs short.... Roy B.: Seems quite insane....
8.P.L.: Not well enough done....Ama Hi: Doesn’t
strike us very hard...M.J.H.: Verse that asks a
string of quite unnecessary questions is never worth
while.. . .H.H.P.: Five and a half pages of preface
to five and a half of yarn Kaskeif: Must go back.
... .A.R.1.: Doesn’t make a story WAV. (Toorak) :
Descriptions of scenery are not much in our line,
and you merely mention a few places and state a
few facts about them... .W.H.8.: Manufactured yarn
that touches real life at no point... .D.O'i).: Im-
possible. .. .Michael O.: Doesn’t strike us... .A.W.H.:
Still misses... .D.T.K.: Makes a long and .tedious
sermon .E.L.S.: Both very thin and made on a
well-recognised pattern... .Waldra: We don’t find
“Mr. Mugge” exciting enough.... .J.R.L.: Nothing in
it....8i1l 0.: The verse on which the gates swing
has too many jolts. .. .N.W. (Maryborough): None
quite up....F.F. (Broken Hill): All fair verse; see
if you can’t make it more interesting S.F.F.:
We don’t find it very gay. .. -H.J.S.: A dreary narra-
tion J.E.E.: One slice of the thrilling ballad: —
Well, I ’ops in an’ ’as a beer
ter wash tha dust down that I eat.
an didnt it make me feel queer!
I felt it right down ter me feet.
Well, I meets a bloomin’ cockie
•an I arsts im for a job;
’e offered me some thistle chopping,
tha wages was thirty bob.
So I decides ter ave er go
an save up er bit of brass,
then ’op right off down below
an ave er good time while it lasts.
So at larst I thought I’d enough
an tosses me boss a week’s notice;
yer oughter seen ’im get the uff
when I told im I wante4 me poultice.
.L.L. (Ascot): No use in that shape... .J.T-G.:
The violent punning doesn’t help it at a 11....
H.P.8.: The religious argument in the form of a
yarn finds this a cold market... .M.F. (Bur wood) :
The thought is too slight; the verse too awkward.
... .8.1t.R.: They are somewhere on the road, but
still a good way 0ff....L.1. (S.A.) : The young man
is altogether too clever.... Beady S.: The idea is
far from new—in fact, a machine of the sort actually
exists—and you don’t improve things in the telling'.
... .D.E.0.: Your desert has only the regular features
and the well-recognised unpleasantnesses Robin A-:
It misses; but more from its lack of interest than
the handling. Be careful of your rhymes. “Wary”
won’t rhyme with “quarry”... .J.E.M.: Seems a
cruel piece of foolishness, but it might have made a
short par E.F.W.: Not enough in it.... W.E.8.:
You suggest a yarn, but don’t tell it.... Victor R.:
The vose is the worst sample we have met for a
week; the prose amounts to nothing A.M.8.8.:
The yarn about eating the dog doesn’t make us be-
lieve it’s true. But it’s better than the others....
Kiwi: Too slight... .E.McK.: Ju tto sketch a small
situation and then blow it to pieces with lightning is
hardly the way to make a yarn Berta Z. :
“Inspiration” is a bit thin and unlikely Michael
L. : You don’t make clear what happened
M. : Too wild and impossible Desmond H.: As
your sheets are not numbered ar.d not in sequence
and the handwriting is only fair, it is impossible to
know what it’s all about J-K.Y.: You haven’t
got all the facts right and the conclusion is nonsense.
Ripponled: Spiritualistic experiences are worth
recording when they are set to a tune like that.
One friend, long dead, with whom I loved to talk,
And who had an insatiable appetite for pork,
Midst nocturnal recuperation will me waken,
Whene’er that delectable dish 1 have partaken.
He presents a word picture in the gloom
As he glisteningly glides around my room.
Though he suffer’d much here, poor chap, he
Tells me to say he is quite well and happy.
I take such spiritual solace each visit offers,
Despite the remarks of the sceptics and scoffers.
I’ve no time for him who scorns spirits, and whines
About the futility of believing in signs;
For long ere each visitation conies, there flies
A group of mystic black spots before my eyes.
C.V.H.: The verse is very drunk in spite of
its high moral intent E.J.C.: Most of it is
pompous rubbush; the rest is weak commonplace.
. ...P.E.8.; Doesn’t strike us J.A.0.: The verse
doesn’t get' near E.C. (Bairnsdale): Weak and
trite.... Coreen N.: Both miss.. ..M.D, (St. Hilda) .
The verse is not strong enough to carry the idea
B. : Though it limps a good deal, it is not
unpleasant M.A.8.8.; An old yarn poorly handled.
Veuf: The lines you scrawled on a gift-book
don’t make us jealous of the book Kelvin: Not
up by a long way F.E.R.: Too much hop, skip
and jump about it....A.8.C. (S.A.): The Rebel
Soul” seems to revolt more against metre than any-
thing else... -G.C.M.: Falls far short.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
Cloverlea; Yes, but the drawing calls for far too
much printed matter. What you’ve got to try
for is to make the drawing almost self-explanatory.
....Mel: Sorry, but it’s worked itself out.... Bain

address to the accountant... .R.M.: A trio of mis-
fits F.A.H.: Jokes about the length of Yiddish

sprawling upon a giant’s draughtboard J.J.C.

it means
health and beauty!
Rexona Girls are world-famous for their beautiful skin
and hair. To be a Rexona Girl is to use only Rexona Soap
and enjoy that natural beauty of the skin and hair which
cannot be imitated, but can be obtained by its regular use.
Ordinary toilet soaps do not assert this influence. Many
of them contain free alkali, which tends to dry the skin and
destroy its delicate texture. Even the best of such soaps can
only cleanse; they cannot heal and protect the skin.
Rexona Soap contains the same soothing, healing, anti-
septic balsams as Rexona, the Rapid Healer, the value of
which in the treatment of skin affections is known throughout
the world.
Simply use Rexona Skin and Facial Soap regularly once
or twice a day, and see if it does not quickly soothe and cleanse
the pores, lessen the tendency to pimples and leave the com-
plexion clear, fresh and velvety.

” Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
And health on both ! "
Shakespeare knew the value of a good digestion —
knew that it’s not what you eat , but what you digest
that lays the foundation of health
But of all the distressing complaints that attack human beings,
Indigestion is by far the most commonplace. This depressing,
devitalising ailment is the deadly enemy of health and happiness,
for you can’t feel well when the digestive organs fail to function,
denying your body the necessary nourishment from the food you
eat. In this condition lassitude overcomes you, a morose, irritable
disposition sets in, your breath becomes offensive, the skin dry,
hard and withered: That’s Indigestion. But you can get
well—and quickly too —by the use of that Medical Gem
One or two doses will convince you that you are taking the right
medicine. You will feel the difference as the stagnant secretions
are expelled, as they must be if you take the genuine Kruse’s
1111
This searching, though non-irritating aperient, more like a sparkling mineral
water than a medicine, is healthful to people of all ages; and so pure that
it can safely be given to young infants
DO IT NOW. Put your digestive system in good trim by taking

“Molokiki” : Tobacco and salt are the chief
mediums of exchange for the traveller in
Papuan wilds. In the main-range villages a
hundredweight of potatoes, cucumbers and
tomatoes may be purchased for the contents
of an average salt cellar. For some reason
the high altitude induces among the natives
a craving for salt, while the desire for
tobacco diminishes.

“Avon”: General Motors Corporation is
showing the Maoriland motor trade a point
or two by shipping cars to the Shivery Isles
in parts —a case of chassis-frames, a case of
mudguards, a case of lamps and so forth.
Not only is duty saved in this way, but no
space i.s wasted in packing, and there is a
gain amounting on the average to about
£3O a vehicle, even after costs of reassembling
are met. '
* * * *
“Sturt” : Adelaide Uni. is finding its new
■Waite Institute for agricultural research a
bit of a white elephant, even though the
donor threw in with his suburban estate a
£70,000 endowment. It spent last year, for
instance, £3OOO on necessary improvements
alone, and the revenue from research work
is hardly worth considering. Professors
Richardson and Prescott have requisitioned
£lO,OOO as a minimum amount for immediate
capital expenditure. J. Tennant Mortlock,
who on both sides of the family represents
some of South Aus.’s most famous squatters,
lias jumped in with a gift of £2OOO as a
start.
* * * *
“Moreton”: Petty thieves are not above
picking up points from the movies. An imi-
tator of the slapstick comedian who beats tbe
coin-in-the-slot contraptions by attaching a
wire to his coin and hauling it back when it
lias served its purpose, lias been operating on
the match-selling machines in Brisbane.
Eventually the overworked penny and the re-
trieving wire got caught in the mechanism.
Other thrifty persons paid for their matches
with medals, slugs of lead, tin-tags, beer-
bottle capsules and similar trifles. The pro-
fits from the match machines (£4OO last
year) go to the Children’s Hospital; but a
little thing like that doesn’t weigh with the
mean dogs.
* * # *
“Werrimee” : I have met many a China-
man on the track in Western parts of
Queensland carrying his swag in the same
way as he carried his vegetables, dangling
at "the ends of his jonkin or bamboo. In
those parts nearly every hamlet and squar-
tage had a Chinese gardener. As these were
always kept supplied with opium, and they
in turn supplied many of the local blacks
with the drug, I have a suspicion that some
of the Chow swaggies were distributors. I
know that one was; he went on a wide cir-
cuit from Charleville—- a yellow sundowner,
who only asked for work where he knew he
wouldn’t get it—and regularly supplied the
dope to a scalper who employed about 60
blacks to hunt wallabies for him.
* * * *
“Avon”: The principle laid down by
Seddon that the development of hydro-electric
power in Maoriland should be a State mon-
opoly has been departed from by the Coates
Ministry, which has given a license to an
extremely influential Wellington syndicate to
exploit West Coast power sources. It is
proposed to harness Lake Manapouri and a
power source at Deep Cove, Doubtful Inlet,
with a right to develop up to 300,000h.p.
The scheme, which involves the biggest
power-enterprise in the Southern Hemi-
sphere, is one for extracting nitrates from
the air. The chief requisites for such a
process are lime and cheap electrical power.
There are large marble deposits within half
a mile of the proposed factory site, yielding
9S per cent, of carbonate of lime, and it is
expected that power can be produced for
255. a horse-power a year. The cheapest
existing scheme in M.L. produces power at
£5 10s. a horse-power a year, and at Niagara
the cost is about 20 dollars; so the estimate
doesn’t seem to err on the side of pessimism.
“W.P.D.”: It is true that H. Tryon in-
troduced Badila cane to N.Q. (B. 14/l/’26),
and that it, does well in certain localities —
on rich, low-lying soil with abundant rainfall.
On ridgy country, where the soil is inclined
to be poor and sandy, and where the rain-
fall is neither heavy nor regular, it is not
a success and is easily beaten by other
varieties which have replaced it. In the
Mackay district IRQ. 426 (a cane bred at
Hambledon) is a favorite and gives good
results. It is also popular around Babinda.
Malagaclie and Cheribon (Mauritius canes)
also have many friends and yield a high den-
sity. Several other varieties bred at Hamble-
doji and Mackay are suited for land where
Badila lias been tried and given up. Two
varieties which appear to have disease-resist-
ing qualities and have high contents are M.
1900 seedling and Q. 813. It is not correct
to say that “to-day the great sugar-belt of
the North is practically one large field of
Badila.” Probably less than 50 per cent,
of the cane grown is of that variety. More-
over, whatever credit attaches to the intro-
duction of Badila cane in Queensland ought
to go to Dr. Reed, who was manager of the
C.S.R. mill at Hambledon when Tryon
brought his specimens from New Guinea, and
wlio experimented with Badila before he re-
commended it to farmers of the district.

Synthetic food, synthetic drink
Become our daily fare;
We have synthetic thoughts to think,
Synthetic clothes to wear.
Synthetic books are on our shelves,
We sing synthetic songs;
Time brings to our synthetic selves
Synthetic rights and wrongs.
Synthetic trade can still command
Our loud synthetic streets;
But there’s one thing we cannot stand—
Synthetic balance-sheets.
Synthetic figures are too thin,
Their empty reign is o'er;
The one great creed that meets our need
Is “Two and two make jour”!

Consider tHe matter well
and you will cHoose a Ford
THE greatest comfort a motorist
knows is that which comes from a
sound motoring investment that is well
within his means. The pounds saved
are like spare tyres, insurance policies
or money in the bank. They add to
sense of security, especially when one
reflects that with this saving come valu-
able improvements in the car itself.
In the new Ford Touring Car at reduced
price are wider, deeper seats, more leg
room. The body lines are lower. There
are three smart colors to choose from—
blue, grey or buff—and bright nickel
fittings. There is a one-man hood, cord
tyres, a windscreen-wiper, and rear-
vision mirror; complete equipment. All
these in addition to the dependability
for which the Ford is famous every-
where.
The Ford is the safest investment. It
is protected by universal Ford service
through 450 Dealers and 2000 Ford
Service Stations.
Ask your nearest Ford Dealer to show
you the car itself, and inquire about the
Ford Easy Purchase Plan. It will
interest you.

Of course you will take your Decca.
It is so compact, so light, that it is no

is just as sweet as the cabinet model you
perforce have to leave behind.
If you haven’t got a Decca you really
must get one to-day.

If any illustration in “THE BULLETIN” takes your fancy, write
to the MANAGER, who will quote you price for the original.
Forty years ago diphtheria was dreaded
as one of the most fatal of deseases; but
medical science has changed all that. Last
year Melbourne had 163 cases and only one
death!
“Chancery Lane”: Re close resemblance
of twins (B. 14/l/’26). Employed in differ-
ent trustee company offices in Melbourne are
twin brothers so alike that each is greeted
in the street by officers of the co. to which he
doesn’t belong. Not only are their faces cut
to exactly the same pattern* but their height
is the same and their voices indistinguishable
from one another.
“Northerner” : Times have changed for the
union organiser, too. The old-time organiser
padded the hoof, humping Matilda. Pre-
sently he was equipped with a pack-horse.
The push-bike followed, to give way to the
buggy. Motor-bikes had a turn, and then
the union started buying motor-cars. Nowa-
days the A.W.U. organiser speeds about in
a Ford (15 are in use in Queensland). Some
day he will fly.
“Miro”: 11. G. Wells was not the only
distinguished person to administer a snub
to the erudite and well-meaning Robert
Stout. A junior Maoriland M.P. who fre-
quently acted as amanuensis for George Grey
at his island home used to chuckle ever a
letter he once took from dictation. “And,
my dear Stout,” concluded old Hori blandly,
“I often think if the Almighty had
only had the inestimable privilege of your
advice at the Creation, what a different
world this would have been !” The future
Chief Justice has himself often told the story
to illustrate the intolerance of Grey towards
those who differed from him.
“Sturt”: The newly-discovered caves on
Kangaroo Island have been summaiuly closed
by the S.A. Government for a thorough offi-
cial inspection with a view to the recovery
of bones and anything else of scientific value
before tourists have the run of the place.
Local residents believe that they will soon
be able to take the shine out of Naracoorte,
the great mainland cavern of the State. The
new discovery is on public land, and not far
from Flinders Chase, the reserve for Aus-
tralian birds and animals. With the caves
as an added attraction, the little-known far
west of the big island has a fair chance of
becoming one of Australia’s main tourist
resorts.
“Machete” : Have “A Lawyer” and other
commentators on soaked parchments (B.
21/l/’26) ever seen one that has been cooked?
lears ago, in the Registrar of Titles’ office
in Townsville (Q.), there were several that
had been baked in a safe which had
been through a fire. The parchments
were of genuine skin, and their original size
was about that of Tiie Bulletin ; but the
heat had shrunk them to an almost exact
quarter of the old measurements. Though
the skins were now brittle, the printing
and writing were clear and sharp, as if
seen through a draughtsman’s reducing-glass.
Even the dinky little colored map of the hold-
ing in one corner was as fresh as on the daj
it was plotted.
It is a law in the Maoriland Public Service
that one must get out at 65 or after com-
pleting 40 years’ service. Mick Hawkins,
Controller-General of Prisons, is one year
under the age and one year over the service;
but the Law would have winked its eye had
he decided to carry on. Mick doesn’t look
his age, and he doesn’t look as if he started
life as a bricklayer, but he did. Coming to
M.L. from Belfast via U.S.A., he joined the
police, entering the prisons branch, and
climbed to the top of his tree. The Prisons
Board, of which he was a member, has very
wide powers, and in exploring the extent to
which criminals might be given a chance to
climb back to respectability it has taken some
pretty steep risks and sustained some hard
jolts to its faith in human nature.
Every member of the A.I.F. was acquainted
indirectly with Dr. Chaim Weizmann, who
is the leader of the Zionist or “Palestine for
the Jews” movement. Weizmann was the
discoverer of T.N.T., Which, as one Digger
put it, is capable of blowing everything into
nothing. He was born in Russia, but was
only a young man (he is now 52) when he
received an appointment at the Victoria
University, Manchester, where he established
such renown as a chemist that, at the out-
break of the war, the British Government
asked him to supervise the manufacture of
explosives. Ilis services increased the readi-
ness of the British Government to listen to
Zionist proposals. This year, it is ex-
pected, 70,600 new Jewish settlers will settle
in Palestine; the corrected total of arrivals
last year was 40,000. There were only 70,000
Jews in all Palestine in 1901.
“Hotham”: The Commonwealth Treasury
has been busy withdrawing from circulation
silver coins of Imperial mintage; a premium
is paid of 2d. and 4d. in the pound’s worth
paid in, according to the size of the coins,
the higher rate being for threepenny- and
sixpenny-bits. Last Christmas in Melbourne
saw a curious check on the withdrawal pro-
cess. Owing to the hoarding of silver by
the big shopping firms for some weeks before
the Christmas rush, there was a severe short-
age of small change. To meet the demand
the Treasury had to release to the, banks
a quantity of the withdrawn English silver
on which premiums had already been paid.
Much of this had drifted back by January
31, so the premium was paid twice over.
It ceased from that date. The silver will be
re-coined in Australia.
“Buttenderry” : I am quite ready to believe
that the complaints made by a London firm
about the carrying of Australian fruit are
well grounded. A few days ago I bought
three tins of peaches, of a well-known brand,
at the local store. There were six halves
in one and five in the others, while the fruit
was either too hard and green or over-ripe
and squashy. London is an exacting market,
and it has repeatedly been announced that
only tins containing a regular number of
halves of sound, well-conditioned fruit will
be acceptable. Insistence on a uniform num-
ber of “halves” may seem finicky; but don’t
forget the vast proportion of tins that are
sold to restaurants; and they want to know
beforehand exactly how many “serves” there
are in a tin. The export bounty, I take it,
is paid mainly to assist the grower, but while
canners remain so careless it is far more
likely to act to his detriment.

The Builders.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
aCROSS a void of formless flame
A A Mighty Shadow seemed to nod
That on a sudden spoke His name;
And out of nothingness was God.
A thousand melodies awoke
On floating wings of purest fire,
Changing to angels as they spoke
The holy words of their desire.
Thought, like a vast wind, swept the void
In torrents of astonished light;
And peaks of darkness, half destroyed,
Fell thundering into primal night.
Then God, slow counting, spoke aloud
Above the deeps the mystic seven,
And stayed in middle flight the cloud
That made the silver land of Heaven.
Great angels to the building came
In even flight, like homing birds,
And crying golden name on name
Built up the dome of happy words.
Tall crystal minaret and tower,
Porches of chrysoprase and jade
Bore emerald stem and sapphire flower
Above an alabaster glade
Where tesselated rubies glowed
In arabesques of olivine
By streams of pearl that glistening flowed
Through beryl arches dimly green.
Clear fountains dashed a silvery spray,
Shot o’er with rainbows in the light;
The city like embroidered day
Fell, fold on fold, to velvet night.
And still the happy voices cried
Till words w r ere lost in perfect deeds
And the great building-music died
Like evening sighing in the reeds.
What more was left for speech or thought?
The perfect thing had perfect birth.
Then God amid his glories caught
The far, wild dream that was the earth.
A silver whisper to the sun,
A colored dust, an ageless plan ;
The will of the great lYord was done
And from the Word arose the Man !
Man, that is servant to the Word-
Net master of his seeking mind —
What is it that his dreams have heard?
What is it that his lips should find?
New words beyond the thought of God.
More mystic than the master seven!
His steed of dreams is magic-shod
With rapture yet unknowm in Heaven.
Because the tears are in his heart,
His laughter on the singing air,
Because of hands that meet to part
Where triumph cannot shield despair,
God listens patiently and, long
Above the glory and the shame
For every prelude to the song
Of man, who yet shall sing his name
And bid the cloud of deeds be still.
Though tremulous with grander mirth,
To build upon his matchless will
The greater Heaven that is the earth!

DACID McKEE WRIGHT.
The Lower Depths.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
FRITZ HARDING, the outlaw of Port-
land-lane, was sitting in his “office”
with a little pile of money before him.
He counted and recounted the notes and
coins over and over again. Eleven pounds.
More wealth than he had handled for years.
Two newspaper sketches had been sold in one
day; a shorthand pupil had unexpectedly
paid three guineas tuition fee; two jobs as
bailiff had netted thirty shillings, and the
Atlas Company had paid him a commission
for diverting a stray borrower, who knew 7 not
the w r ays of the Lane or the wiles of its
touts, from a rival financier.
Fritz had just passed through an unusually
long spell of sobriety, and with capital in
hand wms musing on the possibility of mak-
ing a fresh start. He had made scores of
fresh starts during his hectic life, for has
not every vagabond his spasms of regret, his
vague yearnings for a place amongst regular
people? Generally on such occasions Fritz
was overwhelmed with pity for himself. But
to-day he was sober enough to admit that his
descent to vagabondage was of his own
choosing. His mind was flooded with
memories. lie wondered if the mother and
father who had sacrificed so much to give
him his chance were still alive, over there.
It was always “over there” with Fritz, for
no one could ever find out wdiere he came
from. And to-day he was conscious of the
fading of the zest of life. When a man passed
forty, a reasonably healthy body, a clean
mind, responsibilities, the ties of friendship
were solid assets, and he had none of them.
He had traded them all for a whisky-soaked
body and eleven pounds.
His eye caught the title of a play he had
been reading, “The Lower Depths,” and with
a tremor of self-disgust he realised that it
was such as lie who furnished material for
these melancholy excursions into realism. He
spun a coin—heads for a fresh start, tails
another plunge into the depths. Heads w T on,
and, securely fastening ten pounds of his
capital in a ragged handkerchief, he planted
it in his hip-pocket and opened his book of
Russian plays again.
Presently the door of his office opened and
Louis Goldberg, entering with a bundle of
papers under his arm, glanced with disfavor
at the prevailing dirt and disorder.
“You loafing again, eh? Alvays loafing,”
he grunted.
“Improving my mind, Louis.”
“Mind? Better you mind some vork and
pay vat you owe me.”
"Some day, if you’re not careful, I’ll pay
you. And then”
“And then vat?”
“Then you'll die, old friend. The shock
will kill you.”
"Don’t talk like that. I got a job for you.”
“Don’t want it.”
“A quiet little job.”
“Another widow’s sewing-machine?”
“No, no! Some furniture in Leichhardt.
A bad woman who pays no instalment for
seven weeks. You go with the vanman pnd
seize. Here is the bill of sale and your
authority.”
“Why do you always pick on me for your
woman jobs?”
"Because you do it so nice. Keep them
talking while the vanmen do the work, eh?”
“Payment in advance?”
“Ten shillings. Here it is. For three
hours’ work. I pay you too much.”
“You old liar! You don’t pay me. The
bad woman pays, with an extra half-crown
added.”
"You call me names again? Give me
back that money and I finish with you.”
“Send along your thugs. What time do
we break up the happy home?”
“Three o'clock. You be here for certain.”
After Louis had gone Fritz pondered
morosely on his new T resolves. To go on
with this job meant a fresh drinking-bout,
for he could never go a-bailiffing without
convivial preparation, and —he was thirsty.
When three o’clock arrived he had acquired
the necessary measure, of sympathetic trucu-
lence and was jolting off to Leichhardt in
the bottom of a hired van.
A frail little woman opened the door, and
Fritz’s foot immediately found its place in
the opening. lie had learned this trick
early in the game. Once the door slams
there is the trouble of forcing a way in.
“Good evening,” he said, and handed over
his authority to seize. She read it slowly
and fearfully as he quietly forced the door
wide open and signalled to the vanmen.
“Don’t take my few things,” said the
woman. “There’s only seven pounds owing.”
“Must,” said Fritz as he and the vanman
got well into the hall. “My boss has had
terrible losses. That seven pounds is all
he has left in the world.”
Fritz saw that this was one of the meanest
jobs he had ever taken. Only two rooms in
the cottage were furnished with barest
necessities. He cursed the Atlas Company,
he cursed himself, as the little woman, with-
out further protest, crept into a corner and
wept softly, continuously. The vanman.
stolidly unconcerned, was beginning to dis-
mantle the bed when a voice came from the
doorway:
“What are you doing here?”
Fritz turned to find himself facing another
woman, who, except for lingering traces of
youth, was an exact replica of the woman in
the corner.
“What does this mean, mother?” the in-
truder asked.
And then the mother broke into incoherent
explanation. She had wanted £lO so badly
—brother Jim’s boy had got into trouble;
she saw the advertisements about loans,
borrowed ten pounds, had paid seven back,
but there was still seven owing.
“But why didn’t you tell me?” demanded
the daughter.
“I couldn't —I couldn’t! You do so much.
You spend nothing on yourself. And it
would have been all right if I had been able
to go on doing an odd day’s laundry work.
But”
“Mother!” cried the girl, “you have been
going out —working—without telling me !”
“I didn’t mind; and it paid the instal-
ments.”
And then the girl turned on Fritz. He
seemed to shrivel under her cold stare of
disdain.
“Did you lend this money?”
“Me?” said Fritz. He knew that he must
keep up a show of bravado or run from the
house. “Madam, I am not the god in the
chariot of finance. Only an agent of divine
wrath!”
“That’s even worse,” she replied. “The
paid hack of a usurer.”
“Madam, what know you of the intri-
cacies of finance? Of the laws of supply
and demand? My employer represents supply.
My friend here, the vanman, represents de-
mand.”
“And you?”
“I represent the scavengers. Those who
do the dirty work of the world.”
“And my mother?”
“Your mother? All! She represents the
folly of the world.”
“Folly! To help her brother?”
“In Portland-lane all such actions are
counted as folly.”
“How much is honestly owing to your em-
ployer?”
“Only seven pounds!” cried the mother.
“Only seven pounds! If he will only give
me time”....
And then the folly of the world caught
Fritz in its tentacles.
“Madam, I have a proposal to make which
may avoid this seizure,” he said.
“If you will extend the time,” replied the
daughter, “I will gradually pay off the
balance.”
“That is wiiat I mean,” replied Fritz. “To-
morrow I am starting business myself as
the Lower Depths Finance and Discount
Company. If you will sign a transfer I
will take over this bill-of-sale as my first
security, and you can pay me back by in-
stalments.”
The girl was puzzled—but anything to get
these men out of the house. And so it hap-
pened that Fritz Harding took his place
amongst the financiers of Portland-lane. A
clean receipt was given, and authority signed
to transfer the bill-of-sale. The girl called
him back as he was leaving.
“Are you doing this to help me?”
“Not at all. To help myself.”
“I’m sorry if I misjudged you.”
“Madam, the divine attribute of sorrow
for sinners should not be squandered. You
may find me a harder taskmaster than Louis
of the Atlas.” And, with a flourish, he
swaggered from the house.
On reaching the Lane he dug out his stored
capital, paid the vanman and stumbled into
Louis’ office.
“How you get on?” asked Louis.

Old Peopled
Kidneys
Many Elderly People Suffer
from Some Form of
Kidney Trouble
WHEN past middle age there frequently
comes a noticeable weakening of the
organs of the body, and resulting danger
of quick decline. It is quite necessary to give
prompt help to any part that first shows signs of
wear. Weak kidneys often bring constant back-
ache, lame back, stitches and twinges of pain,
annoying urinary troubles, and the danger of
serious kidney disease. Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills are gratefully recommended by many aged
people. Read these Sydney testimonies.
CONVINCING PROOF FROM
SYDNEY.
A MAN’S CASE
Mr. Frederick Bradd, Crump Street,
Mortdale, Sydney, says: “I caught a
severe cold, which settled in my kid-
neys and caused severe backache. I
suffered intense pain, and could not
stoop or move about freely. I did not
kno-w what to do to get ease, for the
remedies I used did me no good. See-
ing an advertisement for Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills led me to try them.
They gave me relief right from the
first dose, and in a short time I was
cured. I have no sign of backache
now, and attribute my cure solely to
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills.”
Sixteen years later Mr. Bradd says :
“I have been free from backache since
Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills cured
me sixteen years ago. I am still a
great believer in this medicine, and
often take a few doses, as I think the
kidneys need a tonic sometimes.”
A WOMAN’S CASE
Mrs. F. Osmond, No. 8 Gilbert
Street, Manly, Sydney, says: “I was
a martyr to backache, and the pain at
times was almost unbearable. I also
had several other distressing symptoms
of kidney disorder, such as
dizzy feelings and sleepless nights. I
■was always trying one remedy or
another, but derived no benefit from
any of them. One day a friend urged
me to take a course of Doan’s Back-
ache Kidney Pills, and this medicine
proved to be the very thing I wanted.
There was a marked improvement after
taking the first bottle, and by the time
I had finished three bottles of the pills
I was quite cured, all sign of backache
having disappeared entirely.”
Nine years later Mrs. Osmond says:
“I am still free of backache and kidney
trouble, and have been since Doan s
Backache Kidney Pills cured me oyer
nine years ago.”

SYDNEY MAN CURED OF PILES BY
DOAN’S OINTMENT.
Mr. W. Solomon, Wentworth Street, Parramatta, Sydney, says: Abou
20 years ago I had a ve.-y severe attack of Itching, and Bleeding riles, an
underwent an operation. I was right for about eight years, and tnen tn
complaint returned. The agony was terrible. Not wanting to unaerg
another operation, I started using Pile remedies. The number I us ® cl T l^° l ,
astonish you, but they gave me no benefit whatever. I read ot .uoai
Ointment curing others, and decided to give it a trial. After a * e w appnca-
tions 1 obtained relief and one pot cured me. I always keep Doan s Ointmen
in the'house, and shall never be without it, for I know what a thoroug y
good remedy it is.”
Ten years later Mr. Solomon says: “I have still the same good opinion
of Doan’s Ointment. It cured me of Piles many years ago, and I never
suffer with this complaint now.”
KEEP A TIN ON HAND. IT’S MIGHTY USEFUL WHEN
NEEDED, AND IT’S NEEDED MIGHTY OFTEN. Price 2/9 per tin.
“Here’s your £7 ” was the reply. “I’ve
paid the vanman.”’ '
“But there was another fifteen shillings—
interest on unpaid instalments.”
Fritz counted out fifteen shillings and de-
manded a clean receipt.
“Oh I see,” said Louis, “you make a little
on your own from her, eh? Well, I don’t
care, as long as I get mine.”
A fortnight later a woman unknown to
the Lane found Fritz’s “office” and dis-
covered him, half drunk and wholly dis-
bevelled, lying on his tattered couch. „
“I've come to pay my instalment, sfie

Fritz rose and gazed at her without recog-
mtion.

On the money you so kindly lent me.
I lent you money:
“You remember—the Atlas Company’s bill

“Haven’t you got a clean receipt for that
money?”
“Yes blit y0n”....
“Then, for God’s ’ sake get out of this
office!”
“But”
“Get out. 'l say!” and, afraid of the fren-
zied excitement of the wreck before her, she
hurried from the Lane.
A little later Louis looked up from his
ledger to greet his frequent visitor.
“Vat now?” he asked.
“Ten bob,” murmured Fritz, hat in hand.
“You drink it all. eh?”
“Every farthing of it.”
“Vell. I don’t mind. You do that Leieh-
kardt job veil.” And another ten shillings
was added to Fritz's standing debt to his
benefactor.
GEO. S. BEEBY.
The Cat.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
in the evening she found her
■ way back to the mottled, ugly resi-
dential and into her hideous little
room with its e.l. and g.r. There was a
lovely smell of Irish stew 7 coming down the
passageway and her heart began to throb
violently. When she went into her room
and closed the door the gracious perfume
followed her through the window, and for
a w'hile she sat on the bed, drinking it in.
Then she closed the window.
It w 7 as extraordinary that one could go
without food for nearly three days and feel
so clear-headed. Looking in the fly-specked
mirror, she thought liow 7 clear her skin was
and how 7 bright her eyes. The little, straight
fringe across her forehead w 7 as blacker than
ever, but her lips were pale. She got up
and found a tin stick of greasy lip-salve
and rubbed it across her mouth. Her hand
must have trembled a little, or the light in
her room was bad, for it smehred the curves
of her lips, making them look thick and
ugly.
"lake a coon,” she laughed, peering at
herself.
Her feet were tired from walking, and
her stomach felt like a w 7 eight. She slipped
off her shabby Jilack frock with its limp
belt of almond-green and stretched herself
out on the bed. With a little kick her shoes
were dropped on the floor, and her darned
silk stockings were rolled carefully over her
toes. Looking up at the ceiling, she saw-
plates of food appearing and disappearing.
Mixed up with them was the landlady’s
face with its bright blob of cheap paint on
each cheek.
The days came back to her, long proces-
sions of them all bound up w T ith the “want”
columns in the newspapers. No one wanted
a bookkeeper, not even a moderately good
one. For three months she had followed up
every clue that might lead to work. Fat
faces, lean faces, hard and cold faces, furtive
faces, bluff, good-natured faces that be-
longed to nice old men w 7 ho squeezed her
hand; the face of the man w 7 ho had asked her
to pose for nude photographs; the face of
the man who had said something about her
legs.
All these and more combined w T ith the
smell of stew coming down the passage.
All over the world women were being loved
and sheltered. To-night they would dine
with stomachs placidly aware of blissful
morsels, their feet would tap to music. All
over the world women were believing in
emancipation. You could never get eman-
cipated from food. Somewhere she had read
that there w r as enough food to go round. A
funny system that let people starve. A
dog could rummage in a garbage-tin.
Her little black cat crawded out from be-
neath the bed and sprang up on her stomach.
She felt his ribs, but his sides w T ere sleek
and fat. He must be getting food somewhere.
She wondered idly. It crawled up into the
crook of her arm am} purred contentedly.
Remarkable how clear her head w 7 as, but
she felt inclined to giggle. Last night she
had awakened out of a dream that she w r as
flying up in the air. This morning she had
felt sick, her legs bent under her w-hen she
walked. How long would it be before she
was starved out?
She had felt frightened all along; but,
really, starving was not so terrible. After
the first sickness you grew helpless, you
were too tired to be even sorry for yourself.
She could tell people that nothing mattered
—not even emancipation, or freedom, or re-
spectability, or laws, or anything. Just food.
Stretched out on the bed. she thought about
people. Here she was surrounded by
people; but what did that matter? Last
night she had sat in the park and listened
to the sea. Lights sprang out of the gloom,
the sound of children's voices came to her
from the darkened shadows. People were
all alien to each other. You could not en-
compass the loneliness of a human soul. All
of them feverishly grasping at each other,
crying out of a wilderness of loneliness.
Everyone incessantly talking, pretending
to know each other, squirming in their own
little jungles of thought. They grabbed at all
sorts of things to make themselves look real.
Eternally dissatisfied with words, they
yearned for physical contact. Lovers clung
together in an intolerable agony of soul, as
if to fuse flesh and spirit. The night re-
sounded with the noises people made to
cover up the appalling silences waiting to
devour them.
The door opened to admit the landlady.
Her two red cheeks glowed. "Miss Wall,
I’ve got to have my rent. Three weeks, you
know, and I'm behind with my telephone bill.
I don’t want to be hard, but I've got to live. ’
The girl sprang up on the bed trying to
appear as if she had not been resting. “I
know, Mrs. Harris, I'll soon have it; next
week.”
She was smiling desperately. She would
not give in before this woman, but the smell
of the stew was making her ill. She would
be sick, her stomach was revolting. "Go
out, go out, for God’s sake!” her soul whis-
pered. “Keep your head clear and you won’t
be ill,” it whispered.
The landlady looked at her curiously in
the near darkness. “Haven't you got any
people V” she asked, fumbling her fingers.
"No.” Her lips were trembling. "Would
you mind very much, Mrs. Harris —would
you mind going out into the hall for a
moment and closing the door? I'll see you
afterwards.”
“Humph !” The woman sidled out. “I’ll
have to have my rent to-morrow; I can’t
wait.”
“Yes —ah, please.”
The door closed, and she was hanging on
to the washstand dryly vomiting. God, God!
The tears ran down her face and mixed with
the saliva trickling from her mouth. The
smell of the stew nauseated her; her stom-
ach rose, and dry retching tore great gasps
from her. She was too weak to go back to
the bed, so she lay on the floor. She felt
drunk.
Soon she got up and looked in the mirror,
wiping her mouth. She was so drunkenly
light-headed that she wanted to throw her
arms about. Upstairs a pianola was tink-
ling. Through the window she could see the
stars coming out. Well, she would go out,
too. The streets were better than the bed.
"Who knows?” she laughed.
The black dress was slipped on, and two
bright spots rubbed into her cheeks. All
over the world women were beloved and eat-
ing. She laughed again. One found love
and food in strange places.
Outside the w T ind blew dear and cold
through the trees overhanging the street.
They were lovely trees, bending graciously
earthward, rustling about her, and the stars
crackled to each other across the sky. She
thought of death and shuddered. Gas or the
water? Ah, neither of these on a night ;like
this! God knows what awaited you around
the corner, and she had little faith in any-
thing after death. There was only one life
and she must not miss a moment of it.
The lighted streets came like a blow in
her face. The shops were full of pulpy
fruits; cutlets, red and fat-streaked, shone
like exotic jewels. She stood on the kerb-
stone dreamily watching them, swaying a
little. There was an old gentleman over
there waiting for a tram. What would he
say if she spoke to him and said, “Could you
buy me a meal?” Was that what one said?
But why should he? His evening clothes
shone on him; he was too remote from star-
vation. Women, silken and perfumed, drove
past in great cars. What if she shouted
“I’m starving,” or threw herself in front of
a car so that the occupants took home with
them the memory of her torn body? That
would give them a start. She laughed aloud,
and a policeman looked at her curiously.
She caught his glance and shivered, then
moved on as if waiting for a tram. What
did women do? They went into shadows and
said something to men, who either answered
them or passed on.
“I’m strong enough,” she whispered, and
thought of the fruit and the cutlets.
Crowds came and went, and she wandered
up and down the street. The lights flick-
ered in golden pools about the roadway. Once
she stopped in front of a man, and he looked
at her sternly. She laughed and walked
away. “I’m drunk,” she giggled to herself;
“if I’m not careful I’ll be run in.”
It reminded her of a dream. She had
dreamed that she was in a church and sud-
denly flew up amongst the rafters doing the
most amazing tricks. She darted from
corner to corner wafting about like a feather,
dancing and posturing gloriously. Beneath
her she could see the people gazing ecstati-
cally.
“Fancy Mary Wall being able to fly and
dance like that!” they said enviously. “Isn’t
she wonderful!”
She felt that if she cared to give a spring
into the air now she could dance like thati
It would be easy to fly.
A man lurched against her and said some-
thing. It sounded like “What are you doing
to-night, dearie?” but she wasn't sure. She
was just going to turn around and answer
him when someone tapped her on the shoulder.
She looked up. It was the policeman.
“You get out of this, my girl,” he was
saying. “I’ve been watching you. Cut home
for your life. It’s a shame to see a young
girl like you carrying on this way.”
People were looking at her, were thinking
she was a street-walker. “Drunk,” she heard
one of the women say. She laughed again.
Then because her legs were giving way
under her and the tears were smarting in her
eyes, she stumbled from the street into the
shadows where she lived. Her heart was
thumping furiously. “Drunk, drunk, drunk!”
she whispered as she staggered up the stairs.
Safe in her room she threw herself on the
bed and let the blackness envelop her. “I
can’t last out long like this.” she thought;
“I’ll be dead in the morning.”
Someone knocked at her door, and she lay
quiet, fearing the landlady. The knock came
again, and with it a gentle voice calling.
“Miss Wall !” I
She slipped out of bed and opened the
door. It was the old spinster next <}oor
dresised in a dirty wrapper. ' There was a
large steaming basin in her hand. She was
smiling deprecatingly.
“I brought you some soup for the cat.”
she said gently. “It’s too good to throw
away; won’t you take it?”
The dirty wrapper disappeared before the
girl could think about the contents of the
basin. But she stood there hugging it to
her and repeating; “I’ve brought you some
soup for the cat!”
