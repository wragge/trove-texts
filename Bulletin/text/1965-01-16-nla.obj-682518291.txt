“9 gallons of
humidity
my clients didn’t
suffer today”
Humidity is probably costing you
“buckets”! No matter what type of
business you own or operate, heat and
humidity take their toll of your net profit
figure every year. Kelvinator Refrigerated
Air Conditioning could be the business
booster you’ve been searching for. By
quickly reducing heat and dispelling
humidity it provides year-round comfort
conditions for your clients—a competitive
advantage that pays off.
Unlike air coolers (which actually in-
crease humidity) a Kelvinator unit removes
up to 9 gallons a day, because it is a
refrigerated unit.
Completely automatic, it ventilates, ex-
hausts stale air and smoke, circulates and
filters fresh air, and provides the most
economical method of winter heating, too!
How about it? If humidity is costing
you “buckets”, why not investigate Kel-
vinator Refrigerated Air Conditioning. (Just
mail the coupon below.)
P.S. Smart, unobtrusive Kelvinator units
are available from only £lB9 each. (Costs
as little as ninepence a day for your
initial investment.)

National Notebook
Little Deer
A colleague just returned from a
New Zealand deer-shooting holiday
ells the story of two sportsmen shoot-
ing from a four-wheel-drive vehicle in a
remote southern area of the South
Island.
One spotted a spiker (that is a young
stag), drew a bead on it and missed.
Instead of running off like any other
.frightened deer, the spiker moved a few
paces towards the hunter who let off an-
other round. He again missed and the
deer bounded towards him. In anger
the hunter fired off several rounds and
missed each time, even though the deer
was by this time standing almost beside
the four-wheel-drive.
His ammunition gone, a frustrated
hunter threw his rifle at the animal
and the sling tangled around its two-inch
high antlers, tripping it up and landing it
live at the hunter’s feet. It lay there
panting. The hunter was so grateful to
it for not running off with his rifle, he
untangled the rifle and let the spiker leap
away.
Fast Ferry
IA t a demonstration last week of
! Sydney’s new 36-knot, 72-passenger
hydrofoil ferry Manly, the only vessel of
its kind in Australia, we talked briefly
to the most buoyant man on board—-Mr
J. C. Needham, managing director of the
Port Jackson and Manly Steamship Co.
Ltd, and author of the scheme that pro-
duced this £140,000 Japanese addition
to the company’s fleet, the first since the
South Steyne was commissioned in 1938.
Mr Needham, a stockrly built, vital-
looking Englishman, has the air of a
naval officer in mufti, but is in fact a
retired master mariner with a long ex-
perience of inland water transport. He
told us that before his retirement he
was nautical adviser to the Government
of Burma and chairman of the Burma
Inland Water Transport Board.
He came to Australia in 1955, still a
relatively young man, and tried for four
years to settle down on a farm; but he
found that farming is “not quite the
thing it's supposed to be for old sailors”,
and gave it up to buy N. D. Hegarty's
launch and ferry service in Sydney, of
which he is still privately the owner. He
became a director of the Port Jackson
and Manly company two years ago, and
"as been managing director for nine
Months. The plan to send the big ferry
Head to Melbourne in February
tj3 run excursions on Port Phillip during
the Moomba Festival is another of his
ideas.
I feel there must be a forward step
in water transport,” Mr Needham said
decisively. “Our big ferries are getting
old, and we have to consider their re-
placement. We need a smaller number
of large vessels for the peak hours, plus
small, fast ferries like this hydrofoil for
the other services. At present the hydro-
foil is merely an addition to our normal
services. If she's a success, we’ll consider
buying more. We hope to run her for
11 hours a day.”
Up on her foils, the Manly looks like
a wartime HDML skimming the surface
on a slipway cradle. During the demon-
stration she crossed from Manly to Cir-
cular Quay in 14 minutes, compared with
the 40 minutes that conventional ferries
take for the trip. It was a fast, smacking
ride. We thought her comfortable, but
in the confined, rather stuffy way that
airliners are comfortable. When we had
berthed, the captain stepped out of the
wheelhouse to answer questions. He was
Captain R. Jones, who is normally the
master of the old Baragoola, and who
had been undergoing a course of instruc-
tion from an officer of Hitachi Zosen,
the hydrofoil's builders. What was it like
to pilot a ferry at over forty miles an
hour? he was asked. He answered like
one who tasted honey. “It makes the
others seem so slowl ” he said.
A Prod . of Progs
shortage of producers is often
A given as one of the reasons for the
enfeebled condition of Australian thea-
tre. What is meant is the shortage of
good producers. When the Sydney
players, the Q Group, began last year
their first difficulty was finding a suitable
producer. They found one in the ABC.
But Ken Hannam is not the average
prod, of progs for the ABC. Even
after a year with them as the producer
of a dozen-odd notable television pro-
grammes, he doesn't even begin to fit
the pattern. Hannam began as a child
actor and has since been 2UW’s mid-
night-to-dawn announcer, with the old
Mercury Theatre and May Hollinworth,
in Phillip revues, for seven years a pro-
ducer with ATN Channel 7, then with
Waratah Films and in Britain with As-
sociated Rediffusion.
He is now reversing the usual order
by bringing his television experience as
a producer to the stage, on which he has
previously been an actor. He has pro-
duced several lunch-hour plays for the
Q Group and was responsible for the
Independent's current “The Marriage of
Mr Mississippi'’.
Hannam was first interested in the
Q Group simply because here were some
actors “who had got up off their tails
and done something, instead of hanging
about the pubs wondering what happen-
ed to radio". Despite, or perhaps be-
cause of, having graduated from radio,
he regards the great radio age in Aus-
tralian acting as “pernicious”. “It was
much the same as being in prison and
learning to make millet brooms,” he
said. “Once you get out of gaol you
can’t go on making millet brooms, be-
cause there are factories for that sort
of thing. Radio actors could act on
radio and that was all.”
Hannam feels that the great value of
lunch-time plays so far is that they are
bringing theatre to a new audience, to
people who may never have seen a play
before. However, he knows that there
are limits, in time and business talents,
to what a group of actors themselves can
"Now, that's going to extremes!"

do to establish a full-scale theatre. This
year, he hopes, the Group will begin
evening performances and will get more
practical acknowledgement of their en-
terprise from the Elizabethan or other
bodies.
Although Hannam is prepared to give
up a good deal of time to the stage, he
is tremendously interested in and ex-
cited by the possibilities of television. He
believes television is in the process of
a shake-down now, that some of the
people without any particular qualifica-
tions who got on the bandwaggon early
are now being superseded by better-
trained people. “But there still seems to
me to be too much emphasis on visual
rather than on story-telling,” he said.
“This tends to happen when your pro-
ducers are floor managers or cameramen
who have been promoted. They see
a camera-shot and it has to stay even
if that sequence has no meaning to the
actor.”
The Sage of Russell Square
/Charles Hicham writes: “The encom-
iums have followed thick on the
death of T. S. Eliot, whose dry, grey
utterance still dominates the writing of
the poets who have followed him in his
adopted country. He has been praised
for breaking free of the sentimentality
and over-ripeness of the Georgians and
their predecessors, the Victorians. But
while he loosened the tightness of Eng-
lish verse and brought its subject matter
closer to the English reality he swept
away a whole rich vein of English litera-
ture—the full, golden, melodious strain
of lyrical poetry begun with Spenser and
continuing through Shakespeare, Milton,
Keats, Shelley and, intermittently, Byron
and Browning.
“In his wake, only Dylan Thomas
managed to emerge in the full romantic
colors (but he, of course, was Welsh).
A less-known Scottish poet, W. S.
Graham, did partially succeed in break-
ing the mould, but received a mixed re-
ception and now appears to be silent.
Oddly enough, Australia and America
have been left to continue the strong
romantic flavor of the English tradition
unemasculated by the Bostonian precepts
of the grey bard of Russell Square.
“As a playwright, Eliot was frequently
dull and uninspired, although ‘The Cock-
tail Party’ did succeed in capturing the
strangled, bloodless quality of upper-
middle-class English speech concealing
an intricate maze of self-analytical
thought. In ‘The Dry Salvages’ from
the ‘Four Quartets’ his drab language
found its perfect expression in an evoca-
tion of an Atlantic waste devoid of color
and beauty. In the desolate foghorn
note of this poem the true voice of Eliot
Was heard; for all his frequent kindness
and generosity (he was warmly respon-
sive to this writer’s early poems) that
note may be the one for which he is best
remembered.”
Dirty Work
nPHE other day we talked to Casey
Robinson, a visiting Hollywood
scriptwriter, in a Rose Bay living-room
so agreeably chintzy it could have been
the setting of one of his high-powered
Bette Davis vehicles, “Dark Victory”,
perhaps or “Now Voyager”. Mr Robin-
son also wrote for the star or for others
the period films “The Old Maid”,
“King’s Row”, “All This and Heaven
Too”, and Errol Flynn's “Captain
Blood”, and adaptations of three Hem-
ingway stories, “The Macomber Affair”,
“Under My Skin” (from “My Old Man”)
and “The Snows of Kilimanjaro”. A
bronzed, chain-smoking 60-odd, Mr
Robinson reminisced about Errol Flynn
(“He always wanted to be a writer, but
when his autobiography came out I
couldn't read it . . . like most actors he
had to wear rouge and lipstick, so he
felt he had to make up for that in the
only way possible . . .”) and about the
famous director Michael Curtiz, with
whom he worked in “Casablanca” and
other films (“Mike was very sentimental.
When he came to America for Warners
he cried as he passed the Statue of
Liberty. When he docked there were
drums beating, flags waving, and an
enormous crowd ... he said, ‘Look
what Warners have done for me . . .’
Then when he stepped ashore, he found
out. It was the Fourth of July.”)
Bette Davis, Mr Robinson told us,
had been the “most terrorised” person
he ever met, when he first started writing
for her in the 'thirties. Later, she had
become an extrovert, failing to take
advice, and making her own rules; it had
been her undoing. What was it about
the pictures of those days that was so
hypnotic, so convincing? “The studios
were sure of their audience . . . they let
a writer go ahead without interference
. . . today they want to capture an
audience they're not sure of, so they say,
‘Make it dirty’,—now isn't that pathetic?
In the old days when we had censor-
ship right in Hollywood you had to
suggest everything. In ‘King’s Row’ we
had several kinds of madness and a
father making love with his daughter.
We managed to get it all across without
saying anything directly. Today they’d
lay it all down flat in front of you.
Bob Hope said to me recently, ‘Casey,
I’m ashamed of myself. I have to utter
this stuff . .
“I'll give you an example, though, of
another kind of censorship. When we
made ‘Tovarich’ with Claudette Colbert
and Charles Boyer there was a scene
when she jumps into bed with him. The
censors wouldn’t let us do that. We said,
but they're married,, and on different
sides of the blanket. But no. So we
had her jump into bed and the bed col-
lapses. Still no good. So you know
what they finally said? It's OK if she
lands on top of him!”
Today everything was cruder, more
vulgar. What about the Europeans?
Fellini, Visconti, Antonioni? “I don’t
like them. They’re very provincial, with
a smattering of knowing something . . .
but they don’t know anything about the
great creators of the art . . . it's all
fashionable, these French new wavers
who throw logic to the winds . . . and
there’s that Swede . . . but there's one
advantage in all that ... it jerks us out
of a little bit of our complacency . . .”
AUSTRALIAN AND NZ IMPERIALISM

80 Years Ago: January 17, 1885
T’here is something sublimely gro-
tesque in the indignation at pre-
sent being launched at the head of
Prince Bismarck for breach of faith.
A fragment of the remainder has been
snapped up by Bismarck, under the
very nose of 'the British authorities.
T , ' 0 ... , , ....
e British and the German Minis-
ters stand in the position of a pair
of burglars who meet quite unexpec-
tedly in a house which has been
broken into. The first burglar, Bri-
tain, appealing to the good feeling
and decency of the second thief, Ger-
many, and suggesting that, as a mat-
ter of gentlemanly etiquette, he (the
second robber) should gracefully re-
tire, and leave all the premises to be
ransacked by the earlier intruder,
furnishes a spectacle for the gods
to groan over,
move of New Zealand to
. Samoan annexation is not like that
Queensland to New Guinea. The
New Ze . aland Governor and the Pre-
mier discussed the question of
annexing Samoa, at Christchurch, last
month. [Queensland had acted sud-
denlv without British approval to fore-
stall Germany.] The incomprehensible
part of the matter is that Mr Stout,
the New Zealand Premier, should be
in favor of annexation. He is an
advanced thinker on all matters poli-
tical and otherwise, is a radical to the
backbone, and, in fact, is the last
man likely, apparently, to sanction a
grasping acquisition of territory.

PLAIN ENGLISH
The Police Crisis
In his report on the problems of the
Australian police forces on page
19 of this issue Gordon Hawkins
emphasises their failure since the war
to attract able and ambitious young
men into the service. It was different,
he points out, in the depression years
when men of high calibre joined the
police because few other jobs were
available and it is from their ranks
that many of the ablest of our present
senior officers have been drawn.
There is not the faintest doubt that
one of the main reasons why more
able young men do not join the forces
now is the deadening practice of pro-
motion exclusively by seniority a
practice which the NSW Police
Association is currently asking the
Crown Employees Appeal Board to
maintain in its appeal against the pro-
motion of Detective Norman Shearer
of Wagga. This practice is particularly
entrenched in NSW, unlike, for
example, South Australia, and has
been one of Commissioner Allan’s
problems ever since he became Com-
missioner; too many policemen in the
highest positions were there for rea-
sons other than ability.
No one wishes to see ability as
the sole criterion of promotion. This
would be as bad for the morale as the
present seniority practice is. But while
there is no rule of thumb solution,
some balance between both factors
has to be found, and the public has
the right to expect the Appeal Board
to be as sympathetic to the problems
of a Commissioner wishing to improve
the calibre of a force as to the Police
Association which, being composed of
all policemen in the State, is naturally
prejudiced against a minority elite.
The point is that in the past there has
been no such balance. As Mr F. C.
Laut, the NSW Police Association
secretary, pointed out last week, the
Shearer case is the first in ten years
in which promotion has been contem-
plated on grounds other than seniority.
This obviously is one of the main
things wrong with the NSW police.
“Excellent for Revolutions ”
Qf all the arenas of the cold war,
Africa is today the one in which,
next to Asia, the Communist powers
are making their most, determined bid
for influence especially Red China
which, having been forced to abandon
its concern with Europe, now believes
that the road to world domination lies
through control of the underdeveloped
countries. In Africa there are 50 of
these and China has a network of
diplomatic posts, agents and contacts
throughout most of the continent. Its
embassies alone are far larger than
Britain’s or Russia’s and its influence
has been seen most dramatically in
the revolts in Zanzibar, Mozambique
and the Congo. “An excellent revolu-
tionary situation exists in Africa,”
said Chou En-lai.
The Communists have plenty to
work on not only anti-European
sentiment, but also unstable govern-
ments, unpopular dictatorships, seces-
sionist movements, racial hatreds,
primitive superstitions. Even without
the Communists many parts of Africa
would be a mess, but they have not
been slow to exploit Chou En-lai’s
insight.
Against this depressing background
Nigeria has stood out as the hope of
stability and democracy in the conti-
nent. For this reason its recent elec-
tion was by far the most important of
the various elections held this year
and the crisis that followed it the most
alarming. If Nigeria collapses, so do
most of the free world’s hopes for
Africa.
In the event Sir Abubukar Balewa,
the Prime Minister since 1960, was
able to solve the crisis and form a
broadly based government. He has
shown himself to be not only the
least autocratic ruler in Africa but the
most astute politician. But the ele-
ments of the crisis remain the pre-
dominance of the North, the Muslim-
Christian-pagan divisions, the seces-
sionist movements, all culminating in
riots and allegations of corruption.
Although basically a Nigerian pro-
blem, the free nations, including Aus-
tralia, have a direct obligation to help
solve it in any possible way, ranging
from economic aid to closer Common-
wealth ties. Australia’s role, though not
its interest, must be small, but given
the issues at stake we could at least do
more for Nigeria than we do already
under the Special Commonwealth
African Assistance Plan and the
Commonwealth Co-operation in Edu-
cation scheme.
Under these schemes we have help-
ed train about 50 Nigerians, provided
some legal texts, and donated a pedal
transceiver for a Flying Doctor Ser-
vice. We can surely do better than
this.
Death Ritual
Vl7hen faced with the horror of 121
people killed on our roads over
the Christmas-New Year holidays, we
can be excused for looking seriously
into any theory, however esoteric, that
offers some hope of reducing this
slaughter. It seems clear at least that
our regular moralising about drunken-
ness and speeding is having no useful
effect. A recent American study, how-
ever, “Accident Research” by Wil-
liam Haddon Jnr., Edward A. Such-
man and David Klein, has called for a
completely different approach. It
accepts the fact that we are still pretty
primitive people when it comes to
public festivals and asks whether the
road toll can be studied as a mass
neurosis, or as a psychologically
necessary part of a festival.
“What some pre-industrial cultures
achieve by the ritual of blood sacri-
fice,” the Americans write, “we may
be achieving by our yearly slaughter
of innocents. We would shrink from
the idea of drawing lots to decide
which men, women and children were
to be killed each year. But in effect
we are essentially doing just that, and
our explanations of what actually
occurs i.e., the notion of accident,
where the events are attributed to the
will of chance, could well be rational-
isations.”
On this view it is unlikely that we
will ever be able to reduce the number
of road incidents, but we may at least
be able to reduce the number of acci-
dents and casualties not by moral-
ising at drivers but by making cars
more accident-proof. This may seem
a long and very American way round
to a recommendation of, say, more
safety belts, extra padding and so
forth. But clearly more conventional
theories have done nothing to help us
with this terrible problem.


THIS AUSTRALIA
When the Cock Crowed
Playing it cool
AUSTRALIAN FORCES IN SOUTH-EAST ASIA
CANBERRA —By the end of the
first week in 1965 the cock had crowed
seven times, but Malaysia still existed,
and Indonesia had not yet formally
withdrawn from the United Nations.
And while President Soekarno was blow-
ing hot, Australia, in the words of one
official, “was playing it cool” in response
to the announcement that Indonesia had
withdrawn from the United Nations be-
cause of the admission of Malaysia to
the Security Council. Officially it was
a policy of “wait and see”—seeing just
what Indonesia meant by withdrawing
and waiting for any formal request from
Malaysia for assistance.
When External Affairs Minister Paul
Hasluck was asked whether he would be
interrupting Prime Minister Menzies’
month-long holiday cruise to discuss the
situation with him, the reply was “Good
heavens, no.” Nor did he intend to
return to Canberra earlier than planned.
If Canberra was tentative in its re-
sponse this was partly due to the con-
fused way in which Soekarno went about
pulling out of the organisation which he
had branded as a tool of the imperial-
ists and neo-colonialists. Officials at
the Indonesian Foreign Ministry were
still unable to clarify what their
government's intentions were two days
after Soekarno’s speech, lending weight
te the theory that the Indonesian Pre-
sident may have over-reached himself in
the knowledge that New Year’s Day,
1965, called for something spectacular,
Even the government-inspired Press took
a little time to come round to supporting
the withdrawal. But when it did it
echoed Foreign Minister Subandrio’s
view that Indonesia had “taken on the
world”, and that the decision was “not
made on impulse”.
Although the confrontation against
Malaysia is intensifying, there has been
a shift in Indonesian attitudes to Aus-
tralia in the past month. Diplomats in
Canberra see an inclination to keep the
lines of communication with Australia
open. The personal attacks on Sir
Robert Menzies—the “Duke of Can-
berra”, according to one Djakarta paper
•—have stopped. There has been talk of
a “special relationship" and newly-
appointed Ambassador Kosasih has
spoken more than once of hopes for a
meeting between Soekarno and Menzies.
This is despite the first Indonesian
casualties killed by Australian gunfire
last month.
That Australia is in some respects also
trying to maintain the awkwardly bal-
anced relationship is clear from the
reply of the Minister for Civil Aviation,
Senator Plenty, to criticism from Sir
Wilfrid Kent-Hughes. Sir Wilfrid at-
tacked the shipment of telecommunica-
tions equipment worth £750,000 to In-
donesia which would help connect air-
craft and key Indonesian airfields, claim-
ing that the equipment was in the cate-
gory of “strategic materials”. Senator
Henty replied that the equipment was
essential for the use of Australian air-
craft using Indonesian air-space. Further-
more, Australian aid of £l.l million
which Indonesia received last year under
the Colombo Plan is likely to cont/iue.
Malaysia's response to the growth of
armed confrontation was to ask its allies
and the United Nations for help. Aus-
tralia waited for a request from Malay-
sian Treasury and defence officials—-but
hoped at the same time that it would
not be a request for manpower.
A look at the map showing Australia’s
disposition of military strength in South-
East Asia indicates why resources are
stretched very close to breaking-point.
Unless there is a specific formal request
for extra men, Australia will be restrict-
ing further aid to material help in stores
and ammunition and in the training of
Malaysian service personnel. Last year
this kind of assistance cost £3 million.
This and the build-up of British
forces by the airlifting of 1000 fighting
iroops, the removal from mothballs of
six RN patrol vessels, and the despatch
of another aircraft-carrier to Singapore
reminded Australia and New Zealand
that Britain was still very much the
defence umbrella in the near north.
In fact, Britain was spending ten per
cent of her whole defence budget on the
Singapore base alone; there were more
British servicemen in Malaysia than in
all of Australia’s armed forces anywhere
and the defence of Malaysia was costing
Britain as much as her nuclear deterrent.
DEFENCE
TFX
Too heavy?
WASHINGTON On its second
flight over Texas, the controversial F-l 11
jet fighter-bomber solved the minor pro-
blem with wing flaps which caused the
pilot to land the plane earlier than plan-
ned on its first test flight last month.
This time all went well with the distinc-
tive variable swept wings as the plane,
also known as the TFX, reached 460
m.p.h. Twenty-four of the needle-
nosed aircraft, designed to be the most
versatile fighter ever built, are expected
in Australia sometime in 1968 or there-
after as replacements for the Canberra
bomber.
But reports from the United States
raised two major questions about the
TFX’s future. First there is the ques-
tion of weight. Military sources claimed
that the US Navy version of the plane
is so overweight that some aviators feel
it would be dangerous to land the


}|ane on aircraft-carrier decks. One
najor requirement of the TFX contract
was that the plane should make carrier
andings.
Then there is the problem of costs.
These have risen so steadily that the US
Vavy is reported to be considering a
•eduction in its order.
These questions will come before the
US Senate Investigations Sub-committee
when it resumes its inquiry early this
■/ear into the award of the TFX contract
o General Dynamics Corporation.
LAW
Central Court
The Speaker and the typist
SYDNEY During the hearing of
the Maher case at Sydney’s Central
Court a clerk of the court announced
that all other summons cases would be
heard in Court Number Four. Only
two people left.
Mr Maher entered to hear the charge
read out when an attendant had called
“Ray S. Maher” in the vestibule outside.
The charge stated that on “a date in
November” at “a certain place in Mac-
quarie Street, Sydney”, Mr Maher had
“exposed his person”.
Mr Clive Evatt, QC, representing
Miss Shepherd, asked Mr Stonham if
Miss Shepherd could lay information
about Mr Maher or could have laid such
information. “Both”, replied Mr Ston-
ham. Mr Evatt thanked him. (Later that
day she took out a summons.)
The legal discussions and submissions
continued after a morning tea adjourn-
ment during which the crowd on the
footpaths outside the court began to
build up. Mr J. R. Kerr, QC, prose-
cuting for the Crown, told Mr Ston-
ham that any prosecution he would
conduct would be “full and searching”,
that all necessary witnesses would be
called and there could be no suggestion
of a “sham” prosecution (a possibility
suggested by Mr Evatt). Mr Kerr said
that if Miss Shepherd were to lay her
own information against Mr Maher, at
any time, whatever might flow from
that would come before the Court in
due course.
Mr Stonham agreed to the request
of Mr N. K. Wran (for Mr Maher) for
an adjournment until Monday, January
25. Mr Wran said he could not yet
‘say how long he expected the hearing to
last.
As Mr Maher left the courtyard a
few minutes later to climb into a
Vomentarily traffic-bound four-door
sedan, flashbulbs popped. TV cameras
whirred and the “Daily Mirror’s” poster
“MAHER COURT ' DRAMA” was
already waiting on the footpath opposite.
SENATE
Senator Hannan’s Co-respondent
Calwell's alliance with the Liberals
Sir Garfield Barwick, C.J.: Have you
any objection to being added as a
respondent?
Senator S. H. Cohen, QC: We had
not sought, your Honor, to seek to be-
come a party to the proceedings, but
really to make the application in the
terms of the rule.
C.J.: If you want to be heard it may
be that you could only be heard as a
respondent, and if that is the situation
have you any objection to being a
respondent?
Senator Cohen: No, your Honor,
although my submission is that we are
a person entitled to be heard.
SYDNEY Senator Cohen may
have been somewhat reluctant that his-
tory should record the ALP as Senator
Hannan’s co-respondent when the High
Court rejected the application by the
DLP's Mr Frank McManus to bar a re-
count of votes in the Victorian Senate
election. After all, how often does an
Opposition party go to the highest court
in the land to support a Government
candidate?
But Senator Cohen’s colleagues on the
Victorian executive of the ALP sought
very much “to become a party” to the
proceedings of defeating Mr McManus
after the High Court allowed the recount
to proceed. They instructed their scruti-
neers to try to help their own ALP
candidate, Mr C. Sudholz, finish below
Senator Hannan in the final stages of the
recount. Instead of Senator Hannan
being 249 votes behind and his prefer-
ences ensuring the election of Mr Mc-
Manus, as would be the case if there
was no recount, the ALP will now try
to make sure that Mr Sudholz's prefer-
ences elect Senator Hannan.
The electoral officer, Mr C. Lack,
thought that the recount would take at
least a month because of the certain
wrangles among scrutineers. Senator
Hannan hopes that a reconsideration of
informal votes will work in his favor.
Mr McManus does not expect much
change in these votes but is uncertain
how a new “random selection” of pre-
ferences will affect him.
The ALP intervention in the case was
almost entirely Mr Calwell’s idea.
Throughout the initial counting he was
on the phone to Senator Hannan check-
ing figures and offering encouragement.
Mr G. Whitlam and Federal secretary
Mr Cyril Wyndham regard the interven-
tion with dismay. From any point of
view but particularly theirs it is a clumsy
piece of Calwellian self-immolation.
Firstly, Mr Calwell did not consult Mr
Wyndham, the national senate campaign
organiser, or other senior Federal party
officials. Victorian secretary Mr W.
Hartley was Mr Calwell’s executive
officer for the operation. Secondly, and
from a tactical point of view this was
the most frustrating aspect, it meant
that if Senator Hannan retained his seat,
the Government would be able to get its
redistribution legislation through Parlia-
ment this year.
While the Liberal Party is unhappy
about the legislation and is responding
to Country Party pressure in introducing
it, it is the Labor Party which stands to
lose most. With Mr McManus and his
Queensland colleague, Mr Gair, joining
the ALP and Independent Senator Turn-
bull to vote against the legislation, there
was a chance of modifying it or having
it thrown out. This was the tactical plan
of Mr Whitlam and other Labor parlia-
mentarians which Mr Calwell has en-
dangered with his intervention.
Finally, many Labor men felt it was
just plain bad politics to volunteer to
become a co-respondent in a case where
it looked as if husband and wife might
break up anyhow.
EDUCATION
Untrained
Teachers
How to get Federal money
MELBOURNE —No one would
have been more welcome at the Aus-
tralian Teachers’ Federation Conference
in Melbourne last week than a delega-
tion from the Federal Government bear-
ing the secret Martin Report on Tertiary
Education. Two of the main issues on
the Conference agenda—Federal Aid
and teacher training—touch very closely
on the presumed content of the Report,
and delegates were at a loss when the
discussion got away from generalities.
The most obvious connection which
the delegates failed to emphasise was
precisely that between their two main
themes. Teacher training institutions
could be most suitable candidates for
direct Federal money, especially if, as
the ATF proposes, they are made com-
pletely independent of State Education

Departments and associated closely with
universities under some form of insti-
tute. But the chief resolution on Federal
Aid, from New South Wales, was con-
tent to fire off the usual fowling pieces.
It is clear by now that the Menzies
Government does not intend to give spe-
cial money for education unless it can
.specify its use. Last year it gave direct
grants for science laboratories and
technical education, and awarded se-
condary school scholarships to pupils in
the higher forms. Nor will it distinguish
between private and State schools in its
favors. The New South Wales resolu-
tion, which was adopted 21-15, failed
to specify any special areas for assist-
ance, and opposed “the diversion of
public moneys to the subsidising of non-
government schools until the needs of
the government schools can be fully
met." Sir Robert has already shown
how easily it is to fob off flag-waving
like this. Control of education still re-
mains with the States, and all calls for
direct Federal intervention or national
unity must demonstrate that Federal
control in this or that special field is
necessary and desirable.
The Federation’s recommendations on
teacher training, by contrast, contrived
to be both specific and far-sighted. Their
concern is to enhance teachers’ profes-
sional status by giving them a nationally
respectable qualification. The position at
present in every State is gloomy. Many
secondary teachers do not have univer-
sity degrees. The demands of tertiary in-
stitutions for staff are depriving schools
of too many of the better qualified. Pri-
mary school teachers are admitted with
only Leaving Certificate (five years’ sec-
ondary schooling) to two-year courses of
negligible academic worth. All primary
teacher training and an increasing
amount of secondary teacher training is
conducted by the employing authorities,
the State Education Departments. Uni-
versity quotas are steadily excluding
more and more teachers from academic
and (in Melbourne now) professional
training. Above all, recruiting is still lag-
ging. A South Australian delegate sum-
med it up: “Too few teachers are com-
ing out of too few colleges.”
Delegates from all States favored a
minimum entry requirement of matneu-
lation to a'l teacher-training institutions.
They wanted also a four-year course of
respectable standard conducted by an
institute independent of any employ
authority. In this form teacher train
could well become nationally
ordinated and be financed by the Fed<
Government. Some hope that this '
be one of the Martin Report's findir
Even if it is, there will still be a st
battle to be fought in each State, wh
Education Departments are deeply
trenched in teacher training and so
have refused to yield an inch to teachi
demands.
CENSORSHIP
Indecency Tribunal’s First Yea
The NZ genius for doing good with had laws
AUCKLAND After nearly a year
in operation, New Zealand’s Indecent
Publications Tribunal has banned its
first books—three cheap American paper-
backs which it dismissed as “designed to
pander to prurient appetites”. The tri-
bunal found that none of the three books
(titled “Fanny”, “Whiplash” and “Adul-
tery in Suburbia”) had any merit, liter-
ary or otherwise: they were simply
“trash . . . encouraging the acceptance
of abnormal, cruel or depraved conduct
as normal behavior”. Earlier in 1964
the tribunal found that Grace Metalious’
“No Adam in Eden”, though worthless
as literature, was fit for general release.)
More significant was the tribunal's
last ruling for 1964—that William Bur-
roughs’ “Dead Fingers Talk” was not
indecent. “The author,” said the tri-
bunal in its decision, “is obsessed with
the themes of drug addiction and homo-
sexuality and the fantasy world of
science fiction. The literary style is, for
all but the most resolute reader, impene-
trable ... In this linguistic porridge
some of the lumps are inevitably un-
palatable. The author's manner of
writing has so effectively restricted
reading public that in our opinion
further restriction seems called for.”
This decision, like the earlier cle
ance of “Lolita” and “Another Coi
try suggests that few if any books
literary interest will be banned or
stricted by the tribunal. The real te
however, could come with “Lady Ch
terley’s Lover” (reported up for cc
sideration soon) or “Tropic of Cance

The Girl Who Came Back
T|iane McNjece, the toast of Tennant
Creek, sounded a little strained
when your correspondent called. She was
working on the switchboard of the Port
Melbourne branch of BP. “Not another
newspaper story,” she said. “I can hardly
walk. I've got my feet on a chair and
I'll have to see a doctor.”
Your correspondent drove out to
Sandringham to meet the lady at her
parents' home that evening. She turned
out to be a fine redhead, 12 stone in
weight according to one report, and per-
haps a little large by fashionable Collins
St standards, but indeed most comely to
our old-fashioned eye. Her legs were all
bandaged and terribly swollen, and she
had a battered wound on one knee.
“It would have been all right,” she
said, “if we hadn't gone for that swim
out by Con Perry's telegraph post. The
mosquito bites turned septic. And they
had ropes hanging from the bough of a
tree. I swung out, didn't let go, then
came back and bashed the tree trunk.
That fixed my knee.”
Diane's parents, Mr and Mrs D. J.
McNiece, very proud of their daughter,
had prepared a great hard-cover scrap-
book. It started with the story of Diane’s
letter to the pub at Tennant Creek when
she responded to a newspaper para-
graph about the town's 150 lonely men.
“I am 21 years old,” she wrote, “And
a lady. There is nothing false about me,
including teeth (white), hair (red), eyes
(blue), limbs (sound), about sft 6in. in
height, and well built . . .” There were
pages and pages of news stories. “And
this one wrote that the crowd was three
times bigger at the airport for Diane’s
arrival than for the Queen,” said Mrs
McNiece.
Diane : “Well did they put out a green
carpet for the Queen?”
Your Correspondent: “No. I was there
and I don't think they did.”
Diane: “I haven't said this before. It
was my secret fear. I thought they might
be unshaven, four days’ growth of beard
and 80. But they were weren't they
were marvellous. They were all dressed
up. shirts and ties. Nobody was un-
shaven. No 80. Better than city people.
They had after shave lotion. And they
wore ties for the first time in years.”
Mrs McNiece: “I liked the bit how the
store sold out of new shorts and shirts
and the late shoppers had to buy shirts
and shorts all the wrong sizes.”
Your Correspondent: “Was this true
about all the proposals?”
Diane: “I couldn't tell you how many
there were. About 40 I think.”
Mr McNiece: “How about that young
miner fortune teller?”
Diane: “Yes, he just bowled up and
said: ‘You will be married within 12
months, you won’t be rich but you won’t
be poor, you will have three kids and a
long happy life with me.’ I told him I
didn't like fortune tellers and palmed him
off. Was he mad! He didn’t come back
into town for a fortnight.”
Mrs-McNiece: “Tell him about all the
letters.”
Diane: “Yes, Mike O’Connor, he’s the
publican at the Tennant Creek Hotel.
He’s received letters from about 600
girls all over the world wanting pen
friends with the miners. One girl in
Hawaii has sent her photo and is
threatening to come over. Then there was
a story about an International Contact
Bureau in Toronto, a sort of Lonely
Hearts Bureau, which was sending pic-
tures of 100 Canadian girls. You don't
think that would be all fair dinkum do
you?” •
Your Correspondent: “Seems pretty
doubtful to me.”
Diane: (nervously): “I think so too.
I had a beaut time. Parties went on and
on. It was nothing to drive out 100 miles
just for a swim at Frewena Road House.
They've got a proper swimming pool.
Bed? Used to go to sleep at all hours.
Then 1 had to get up at nine. Too hot.
After lunch I’d have a shower, sleep
until five and it was on again. Christmas
dinner we had at the Tennant Creek
and Mike O'Connor just turned it on for
the whole town . . . sucking pig, chicken,
turkey, duck, crayfish, prawns, pink
champagne, sparkling burgundy,
moselle.”
Your Correspondent: “How about this
fellow who won the right to escort you
for a week?'"
Diane: “Bull Rademacher. Oh, the
poor man. he was terrified. Three of the
boys had to drag him in to meet me.
We'd have drinks at the Peko Club and
after three minutes he'd disappear into a
corner. But he did take me to dinner
once and we drank Star Sparkling
Moselle, sort of champagny stuff.”
Your Correspondent: “And were they
all well behaved?”
Diane: “Every man was a real gentle-
man well, almost everyone. One of the
blokes clobbered a fellow and laid him
out because he kissed me when he
shouldn't have.’’
Your Correspondent: “And do you
expect to go back?”
Diane: “I might go back sooner than
anyone thinks. Next time I might take
back two friends with me. Only two. I
wouldn't want to muck up all the pro-
posals.”

Investigating the Police
More B.A.’s needed
By GORDON HAWKINS
(Senior Lecturer in Criminology, University of Sydney)
Some weeks ago two Sydney detec-
tives were suspended from duty. It
was reported that they were to face
charges of soliciting and accepting
bribes. But “reported” isn’t quite the
right word here. For the matter was
dealt with by the evening papers in a
manner which would have done justice
to the outbreak of World War 111. More
recently Det.-Sgt Longbottom of the
NSW Special Branch has been getting
the treatment. Apparently he inter-
viewed someone “without the prior
knowledge of the Police Commissioner”.
As he must have done many thousand
times in the course of his career. But
in this case the interviewee was the
typist who has made allegations against
the Speaker of the NSW Parliament.
This so excited one editorial writer that,
in a leader headed WHAT NEED OF
SPECIAL POLICE?, he suggested that
all State special branches should be
abolished. Meanwhile in Victoria the
police are being accused of usurping the
functions of prosecutor, judge, jury and
executioner, because a patrolman shot
and killed a youth alleged to have stolen
a car and attempted to ram a police
car. And in Queensland, the brother
of a prisoner found hanged in his cell
has told the newspapers: “I will not let
the police whitewash my brother’s
death.”
Of course there is nothing particularly
novel about all this. Whilst in
Britain the police have until recently
been supported by the myth of the well-
loved English policeman basking in a
permanent glow of public approval,
here a rather different legend has held
sway. Ruthless and cowardly predators
have been canonised as “wild colonial
boys" who always “died game"; but
those who risked and gave their lives to
capture them are commonly recalled
only to be denigrated. This is said to
be a country of rugged individualists
and non-conformists with an inevitable
antipathy towards its police forces —
although our rugged individualism and
non-conformity rarely seem to amount
to much more than occasional trucu-
lence in dealing with law enforcement
agents.
Yet the Australian legend has some
unfortunate consequences. For critics
of the police seem to regard themselves
as licensed to indulge in reckless asper-
sion, and the police are castigated not
merely for inefficiency when it occurs
but also for efficiency in enforcing laws
which are unpopular and unrealistic.
Naturally they often respond with de-
fensive obstructionism and a tendency
to regard all complaints as the product
of perversity or disaffection. Such an
atmosphere is extremely prejudicial to
rational discussion of the roie of the
police. Yet there are a number of im-
portant problems in this area which
clearly call for such discussion.
Violence and torturef
TTUke. for example, the question of
police violence. The existing
arrangements for handling such com-
plaints about this have been criticised on
the ground that the police are left as the
final arbiters in cases where their own
conduct is in question. It is in the
interest of the police themselves, say the
critics, that as few officers as possible
should be found guilty of misconduct.
This, together with what Lord Devlin
calls ‘‘the general habit of the police
never to admit to the slightest departure
from correctness”, will, it is said, inevi-
tably induce reluctance and tardiness in
investigation: and is likely to influence
the outcome of any investigation.
Now there is no police force in the
world without some bullies, and “battles
with the customers" are universal. But
is there any reason to believe that the
situation is much worse here than else-
where? Or that allegations of violence
are not at present fully, conscientiously
and vigorously investigated? Unfor-
tunately. with or without reason, such
views are widely held. Thus, in 1962,
one academic philosopher, writing of
“police brutality against defenceless
prisoners", said that “only the lame, the
halt and the blind deny that Australian
police forces regularly engage in bru-
tality which must sometimes amount to
torture". The only evidence cited in
support of this allegation, incidentally,
was “the Stuart case in South Austra-
lia”. This is rather like saying that no
one would deny that Australian philo-
sophers regularly seduce their female
students and substantiating the assertion
by reference to allegations in the Orr
case.
But whilst the disposal of serious
complaints is in the hands of the police
themselves such charges are likely to
persist and to be believed. And this
makes nonsense of the argument (used
by the British Royal Commission in
1962) that independent inquiries would
damage police morale. For the main-
tenance of police morale depends more
than anything on satisfactory relations
with the public. As a matter of fact it
is probable that more policemen are
found guilty at disciplinary inquiries
than would be by impartial outside tri-
bunals with proper legal safeguards for
the accused. Yet there is little doubt
that such a system would enjoy the
confidence of the public to a far greater
degree than the present one.
Security organisations
topic of major importance is
the police manpower situation. It
is common knowledge that some bran-
ches ot the police are grossly over-
worked, and this is probably at the root
of many complaints against them. Obvi-
ously the - efficient detection and swift
apprehension of criminals depend upon
the maintenance of police forces at ade-
quate strength. Now the Australian
Federation of Police Associations/
Unions, which represents over 15,000
police in Australia, has stated that all
the Australian police forces are below
the strength necessary in the light of
present needs. At their Biennial Con-
ference last September in Hobart it
was decided that each State Govern-
ment should be requested ‘"to increase
the police authorised strength to the
ratio of one police officer for each 530
head of population”. Is this demand
excessive and unrealistic? On the con-
trary, it is comparatively modest.
The figure of one policeman to every
530 persons is rapidly being approached
in the United Kingdom, and this is well
below the standard considered necessary
in many other countries with compar-
able crime problems. The figure in the
USA is one to 502; in Western Germany
it is one to 391; and in France it is one
to 329.
In Australia a very different situation
obtains. For the ratio of police to


population in NSW is one to 718.
Although this is the worst figure for
Australia, that for Victoria is one to
694, and in South Australia it is one to
689. Queensland with one to 582 and
Tasmania with one to 568 are better
placed; but the overall position is highly
unsatisfactory. One result of these de-
ficiencies is that the police are forced
to allot priorities in investigation, and
that time is not available for dealing with
much petty crime. Another has been
that businessmen and property owners,
and also many local government bodies,
no longer rely on the police forces for
protection of their property. There
has been a rapid growth in private
security organisations such as Securicor,
the Australian Watching Co., and Metro-
politan Security Services. They take up
two pages in the Sydney Classified Tele-
phone Directory or “Pink Pages” for
1964; and another couple of pages is
devoted to detective and investigation
agencies which handle anything from
tracing missing persons to larceny. As
wealth has multiplied in Australia, there
has been a manifest failure to make a
parallel expansion in the means of pro-
tecting the increased amount of pro-
perty. Neither the men nor the equip-
ment necessary for efficient operation in
modern conditions have been made
available.
Unreported Crime
this point it might have been illu-
minating to cite the relevant sta-
tistics as measures of police efficiency.
But the search for these figures merely
discloses another serious deficiency. For
there are no uniform statistics of crime
in Australia. Reliable figures, which
could be used as indicators of the mag-
nitude and nature of the tasks of pre-
venting and detecting crime and of the
degree of success attained in perform-
ing these tasks, are just not available.
It is generally agreed that the best index
of police efficiency is provided by re-
lating the “number of serious offences
known to the police” to the “percentage
cleared up”, but although the dangers
of inference from these figures are well
known, for the extent of unreported
crime is incalculable, there is no danger
here for the figures are unobtainable.
This is due in part to differences of legis-
lation and law enforcement in the vari-
ous States, but also to the fact that
some States provide no figures for
“crimes known to the police”, only for
“offences brought to trial”.
Where figures are available it is diffi-
cult to believe that they can have been
compiled on the same basis. New
South Wales usually claims something
like 80 per cent of serious crime as
cleared up, whereas the Victorian figure
on their major crime index is commonly
around 45 per cent. The figure for
serious offences cleared up in Queens-
land is approximately 40 per cent; for
Tasmania around 36 per cent; and for
the Northern Territory it is 50 per cent.
South Australia claims approximately
60 per cent for offences against the
person and only 30 per cent for offences
against property. Incidentally, the New
South Wales figure is exceedingly high
not only by Australian but also by world
standards. Only some 26 per cent of all
serious American crimes are cleared.
It seems likely that differences in
methods of recording crime are respon-
sible for some of the more startling
variations and that in this context com-
parisons are not so much odious as
meaningless.
Until recently Australian police chiefs
displayed no uncontrollable impatience
about this state of affairs; some of them
no doubt because they regarded the com-
pilation of statistics as an irksome diver-
sion of police resources from their
primary function of preventing and
detecting crime. At a conference of
Police Commissioners last year, however,
it was recommended that the collection
of uniform statistics of selected crimes
be introduced throughout Australia. This
is now under way, and the Common-
wealth Statistician has agreed to under-
take the compilation of such statistics
from returns which are being submitted
by the various Australian police forces.
The attempt is on a modest and limited
scale but is a welcome first step.
There are many other areas in which
the police are increasingly called on
to perform difficult, complex work;
and the future will inevitably make even
greater demands on the intelligence and
education of the ordinary policeman.
Yet it is unquestionable that in condi-
tions of full employment, in the face of
competition with industry and the fact
that entrance to universities has become
easier, the police are recruiting a much
smaller proportion of able and ambitious
young men than in the past. The Bri-
tish Royal Commission were unable to
discover any recent instance of a uni-
versity graduate entering the service.
There is no doubt that the same obtains
here.
University Graduates
HPhis is a serious matter for at least two
reasons. There is no less need in
the police than in any other organisa-
tion for the special knowledge and
skills which can be acquired, and the
qualities and abilities which are best
brought out, by academic training. Nor
is this merely a matter of providing
accountants for fraud squads and tech-
nicians for scientific bureaux. Of equal
importance is the problem of leadership.
The ideal senior police officer, it has
been said, would be the man with the
mental agility of a first-rate barrister,
the organising capacity of a GOC and
the tact of a family doctor. Fortunately
in the depression years many men of
high calibre were attracted to the police
because there were no other jobs avail-
able and from their ranks many of the
most able of our present senior police
officers have been drawn.
But without the impetus of unemploy-
ment the difficulty of getting high-
quality recruits is increasingly serious:
But there is an alternative. As Ben Whi-
taker puts it in his excellent Penguin
Special on ‘The Police”: “Since police-
life is unable to attract graduates, ser-
ving policemen should become gradu-
ates instead”. In other words the police
forces should arrange for promising
officers to be seconded to universities.
It is true that an attempt is currently
being made at the Australian Police
College, Manly, to meet the need for
training senior officers. There four-
month courses with a strong liberal arts
component, which are intended amongst
other things to broaden the outlook of
students, are provided. They are
attended by senior officers from all
States, often already earmarked for pro-
motion. This, however, does not solve
the problem of attracting able and edu-
cated recruits who will make good senior
officers in from twelve to twenty years’
time. A scheme of university second-
ment, however, might do so, and would
probably be more acceptable to the
Police Associations than creating an
“officer caste” by direct recruitment.

Stop-over in Moresby
That town that isn’t
By HUGH CURNOW
To stop-over for the first time in Port
Moresby is to experience a few
shocks. The moment you alight
from the plane at the airport is one of
them. It is like stepping into a vast
sauna bath and seems incredible at a
few minutes past 6 a.m. Then there are
the Papuans standing nearby. Solemnly,
glumly, almost bovinely, they watch
you walk across the warming tarmac.
Compared to welcomes in Fiji, Samoa
and Tahiti, this reception is nil. No one
seems to have taught the Port Moresby
Papuans how to be the first to smile.
(If you smile yourself, they relax and
return the greeting with a wave. Until
then you would think they half-expected
a kick in the pants.)
The day I reached the airport a Dis-
trict Commissioner was returning to
Papua on the same Ansett-ANA flight
from Sydney. Towards the end of the
eight-hour flight he was assembling his
papers, Customs declarations and so-
forth when suddenly he blanched. “For
a while there I thought I’d forgotten my
entry permit,” he told me a moment
later. Even after 20 years’ service in
Papua this Australian still needed an
entry permit to get back in. Obviously
it is another country.
A drive into town reveals Moresby—
the political centre and proposed centre
of the University of Papua and New
Guinea—as a sprawling, hilly collection
of villages with a motley assortment of
houses sprinkled about, apparently willy-
nilly. It does not appear to have a
centre, a beginning or an end. You're
in it before you realise and it is much
smaller than I expected. It is the town
that isn't; an area rather than a place;
a way of life like North Queensland’s
yet so unlike it at times as to be quite
foreign.
On a short visit, broadly, you meet
those who are Territorians through and
through—many of them selflessly devoted
to the natives’ welfare—and those who
are spending only a few years in Mores-
by to see what they can make out of
that. This second group seems the
majority. Of the 8000 Australians (mostly
public servants) now in Moresby, I was
told authoritatively that more than
half had left and been replaced in the
past few years. (One freelance journa-
list who has been there four years re-
gards himself as an old-timer.) This
“floating” character applies also to the
native population which is nearly all
Papuan. The Moresby district’s native
population of 28,000 includes 17,000
visitors (of whom more than 4000 are
permanently unemployed). So most of the
idle Papuans you notice standing about
or squatted on street corners and under
trees are probably not Moresby citizens
but strangers in town.
I also found that none of the local
whites I met (including those who were
born in Papua) regard themselves as
white Papuans. British settlers in
Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda whom
I met before those countries’ Independ-
ence Days scorned the label of “British
East Africans” and with some pride pre-
ferred to call themselves Kenyans,
Tanganyikans, Ugandans. But I doubt
any born and bred white man in Mores-
by would ever call himself a Papuan.
“Papua is part of Australia,” they em-
phasise. “So of course we are Austra-
lians. Only the natives are Papuans.”
IT’eith McCarthy, Director of Native
Affairs, is one of the devoted Terri-
torians. In his home near the adminis-
trative centre is one of his proudest pos-
sessions, an aberana. This is a New
Guinean native token of the right to
allocate land usage and he is believed to
be the first white man to be presented
with such an honored feathered stick in
that part of the world. (It was* given
to him by the wealthiest clan in Papua-
New Guinea, the Kuanuas, known as the
Tolai people, of the Gazelle Peninsula.)
He loves the people but does not mini-
mise the problems. “You’ve got to re-
member how primitive many of them
are. At the moment they can’t under-
stand why we don’t kill murderers on
the spot.”
He was the only man I met in Mores-
by who would admit to the existence of
color discrimination as distinct from
“social segregation”. I had seen Papu-
ans segregated in hotels, living areas and
on the beach in Port Moresby, but
everyone else said that was only “social”
and as much the Papuans’ choice as the
whites’. The Assistant-Administrator,
Dr John Gunther, for example, had told
me at a New Year’s Eve party that
native Papuans do mix socially with
whites in Port Moresby. (He pointed
out the only Papuan guest at the large
party as an example!) The hospital secre-
tary, Mr Adrian Matthews, told me more
“indigenes” were now able to afford to
pay for their beds and were booking
into the formerly “Europeans-only”
section of the hospital. Mr John Blair,
editor of the Port Moresby paper, “The
South Pacific Post”, had introduced me
to two of the paper’s Papuan employees,
Dargie Taurega and Genaia Logiva,
without whom, he quipped, the paper
might not come out and with whom he
was obviously on very friendly terms.
On the subject of discriminatory pay
in Moresby, the natives’ basic wage of
£3 a week was generally considered
“enough for them for the time being”.
But there is another sort of dis-
crimination also evident. It was Keith
McCarthy who assured me that none
of the many clubs in Port Moresby
has a native member. “I had this
driven home to me when I nominated
a young native friend, who was some-
thing of a protege of mine, for member-
ship of a club frequented by his white
friends in the Administration. He was
seconded all right but then black-balled.
I asked why but could get no official
reason, except that it had nothing to do
with his character. I realised it was his
color that was keeping him out, said so
and resigned—as did 50 other members
in sympathy. No one would risk nomi-
nating a Papuan friend for membership
of a club here now, for his sake. I
would hate to think that any friend of
mine would be hurt like that again.”
Ane of the first things that almost
” everyone told me to do during my
four days in Port Moresby was to visit
a basement bar they call The Snake Pit.
Then, and only then, they said, would
I appreciate .fully the depths of degrada-
tion to which “natives” can sink. (Con-
trary to official terms in Canberra the
popular unofficial word for native
Papuans and New Guineans in Moresby
still is just “natives”. Only a few people
I met spoke of them as “Papuans” or
“New Guineans” in conversation, and
just one or two others used the anthropo-
logical “indigenes”.)
The “natives” in The Snake Pit, they
said, gave a nightly demonstration of

the evils of legalised native drinking.
They went on to describe in lurid detail
the filth and smell of the place. I was
taken there by three of Port Moresby’s
Australians. One, Papuan-born, told
me on the way that he used to
regard “native boys” as his best friends.
“That's all changed now,” he added. He
then stopped a drunken Papuan who
was leaving the bar as we arrived and,
grabbing him by the shirt, spoke to him
in pidgin. Next he pushed his way
through a knot of drinkers and disap-
peared in the direction of the native
lavatories. (I did not see him again until
later that evening back at my hotel. I
found him nursing a bleeding knuckle.)
Papuans I met in The Snake Pit re-
minded me that if one punched them
in the region of the solar plexus one
could be charged with attempted murder.
(Most Papuans’ spleens are so weakened
by centuries of malaria that a sharp
blow above the stomach can kill them
outright.) But the thing was, they
thought it necessary to warn me about
this, just in case I, as a white man,
might be feeling a bit punchy.
Standing as they were in pools and
patches of body wastes the few hundred
native drinkers in the bar were a pitiful
sight. My informants had not been ex-
aggerating about the filth of the place.
At a slightly cleaner end of the bar I met
Sylvester Taugawanuri who said he had
been to an Anglican missionary school.
He and his friend, John Ani of Yule
Island, were sharing a three - shilling
plate of rice and curry with their beers.
They insisted on buying me a drink.
Then, for some reason, John Ani began
to talk about Christ. “He was a white
man but do you know I love Him just
the same?” he asked.
T>ort Moresby, everyone assured me, is
A nothing like the rest of Papua-New
Guinea. I can well believe it. In the
bar native drinkers use at the Papua
Hotel Mr Mahuru Rarua-Rarua, secre-
tary of the Federation of Native Associ-
tions, told me he feels happier in Aus-
tralia. “I get treated like a human
being there. Do you know what hap-
pened the other day? I was waiting at
the counter with a
£lOOO order for goods for my Associa-
tion. I waited and waited while others
got served—some of them white women.
Then the man behind the counter turned
to me and said ‘What’s for you, tiger?’
I resent that term, ‘tiger’, I really do.”
So much for the dirty, the down-
trodden and the disgruntled. By no means
do they represent all of Moresby. There
is an extremely wide range of less-publi-
cised but equally outspoken, pleasant,
happy people of both races in the dis-
trict. More than this, in fact, they are
hard-working, honest, forthright and
engaging. Many of them are teachers,
missionaries and patrolling field-workers,
but many more of them are just ordi-
nary public servants or private citizens
who like the place. And its people like
them. In the dining-room of the Papua
Hotel native waiters, who serve meals as
fast as they can carry them without
having both feet off the ground at once,
are treated with civility by white diners.
And they are Papuans who do smile,
continually.
Elsewhere the feeling of shoulder-to-
shoulder effort is apparent. In the ex-
tensive administrative area Papuans and
Australians work alongside each other
with mutual industry and relaxation.
Also not without a sense of humor.
(“You ought to see the Australian
plantationers at Rabaul,” a Papuan in
Admin, told me, “ —they really work
like niggers.”)
And what people reveal in their own
homes is as significant in Moresby as
anywhere else. I found much more than
a superficial sympathy for the “natives”
among the Moresby “cliques” of white
society. When Mrs Dawn Higgin told
how she had been on the verge of tears
because one of her house-boys imagined
he was a victim of sorcery, everyone in
the room knew it was not losing house-
hold help that upset her. It was clear
she was genuinely concerned about native
ignorance. I met a lot of Moresby people
like that.
Yet I was left with the firm impression
that Port Moresby people don’t seem
even remotely as concerned about any
present or future hiatus in Papua as
Canberra and the Australian Press and
the United Nations appear to be. “Do
write what it’s really like up here,” my
hostess told me at one of the virtually
endless round of cocktail parties the pub-
lic service, private enterprise and business
social circles amuse themselves with in
Moresby. “We’re not really all sleeping
with reyolvers under our pillows think-
ing we’re sitting on top of a volcano,”
she said . . . Not only the attitudes of
the jobless Papuans appear to be dor-
mant in Port Moresby.


A Bush for Good Wine
The end of the “hands up for porridge ” era
By PATRICIA ROLFE
The promotion of Australian wines is
now in the hands of an English-
born Welsh ex-golf professional
who half a dozen years ago was washing
glasses in the Ship Inn at Circular Quay,
Sydney. He is Mr Len Evans, who will
probably become Federal marketing dir-
ector (the title is not decided yet) of the
Wine and Brandy Producers’ Association,
but whose salary, so intricate is the
blending of interests in the industry, will
be paid by the Australian Wine Board.
Mr Evans regards his progress as evi-
dence of what a “marvellous country”
Australia is. He got to the Ship Inn by
a fairly roundabout way. After school
and national service he intended to go to
Cambridge but became a golf profes-
sional instead. “One day I was coaching
a woman at Potters Bar course and I
thought to myself, ‘l’ve had enough’,”
he said. “The next day I went to Canada
House. They weren’t interested in me. I
went to Australia House where, believe it
or not, the man behind the desk said:
‘Have you got ten quid, mate?’ I went
on to New Zealand House where the man
said: ‘Could I be of any assistance, sir?’
I went to New Zealand.”
A couple of years later Mr Evans was
in Australia. He roamed the back coun-
try for some years, drinking, he says,
nothing except an occasional glass of
wine, but even with this small encourage-
ment kept up the interest in wines he had
developed as a very young man. He came
to Sydney to do script-writing and, in
fact, was well established at this for 18
months before he realised there wasn’t a
great deal of money in it. He then wound
up in front of the sink at the Ship Inn.
He got his hands out of the suds long
enough to become a systematist and ana-
lyst, a key person in the hotel trade who
can tell a publican from an analysis of
a fortnight’s sales what the annual trad-
ing figures should be. From there Mr
Evans went to the just-opening Chevron
Hilton Hotel, where he eventually be-
came assistant general manager. “I went
to learn American business systems,” he
said, “but finished up learning about
people.”
He was part of the young team which
in the face of great odds, from the hole
in the ground beside them to the hole in
the pocket of the board of directors,
built up trading profits and a public
following. The trading profits which, in
some of the departments under the con-
trol of Mr Evans, reached near maxi-
mum then became the indirect reason for
his leaving. He felt he had proved it
could be done, so there wasn’t much
point in going on doing it.
“But I still think the Chevron is one of
the greatest things that has happened to
the hotel industry here,” he said. “It is all
very well to talk about the Australia and
the Windsor in the good old days. In
the good old days staff cost 3s. 6d. an
hour while we were paying some of our
chefs top executive salaries. And people
are a good deal more sophisticated and
earn higher salaries than they did in the
good old days. Yet I think we managed
to give the customers something of
what the old-style innkeeper stood for.”
P]Phe Chevron also built up a reputation
A for its wine cellars, and this may have
led Mr Evans into the wine industry.
The wine industry until now has had
a public relations officer but no full-time
promotion.
The increase in the drinking of table
wines in the past 10 years might make it
seem that wine can now promote itself.
But Mr Evans points out that although
wine consumption has increased, so has
the drinking of beer, Scotch and other
beverages. And so, of course, has the
population.
Mr Evans agrees that there is a tre-
mendous amount of snobbery in wines,
but regards this as part of the industry’s
stock-in-trade. “What I like in this
country is the exuberance with which
people go about learning about wines,”
he said. “There’s so much honest vitality
about the way they find out about wines,
or culture or anything they take it into
their heads to learn about.”
Although the switch in emphasis from
fortified to table wines over the past 10
years is generally regarded as a good
thing, Mr Evans’ job is just as much con-
cerned with promoting sherry and brandy
as with table wines. From his experience
at the Chevron he feels that prejudice
against Australian brandy is going in
much the same way as prejudice against
Australian table wines vanished.
The changes in fortified wines is mostly
in where they are drunk with the wine
parlors in New South Wales becoming
smart bistros. The trade regards the pass-
ing of the wine parlor as no great
tragedy.
Mr Evans so far has only rough notes
of his future campaigns, but his general
idea is to begin with the person who
sells wine rather than with the consumer.
“We want to get away from the ‘hands
up for porridge’ sort of attitude of the
sales assistant who neither knows nor
cares what he is selling,” he said. “If the
retailer knows what he is selling, then
the customer knows what he wants.
“But with some notable exceptions re-
tail outlets are very poor. Fortunately
the publican now realises he must learn.
We are hoping to have intensive courses
with lectures by representatives of all
sections of the industry. It is no use
just going along for an hour a week. We
want to have courses eight hours a day
for a week.”
Mr Evans thinks that out of these
courses could come something like the
winemasters of England or the Chevaliers
de Tastevin of Burgundy. “Of course,
there is a lot of hocus pocus about some
of these associations,” he said, “with
people dressed up in fancy robes, but
there is something to be said for people
who are selling wine getting together
and talking about their products.”
Mr Evans’ own views on Australian
wines, the consensus of much expert
opinion, is that the very best French and
German wines cannot be approached but
that the general run of wines produced
here cannot be equalled anywhere.
“Apart from quality the conditions
under which Australian wines are pro-
duced are excellent,” he said. “They are
probably purer than most wines in that
no added sugar or preservatives are
allowed.
“And new techniques are both improv-
ing quality and shortening the period of
fermentation. Regulated fermentation
and the judicious use of small oak casks
enable reds to come on the market much
sooner, and some whites can now be
drunk soon after they are bottled.”

Letters to the Editor
Macainsh's Poets
SIR.—Two conspicuous parts of N. Mac-
ainsh’s appeal (The Bulletin, Dec. 19)
for contributions to the Australian sec-
tion of the Commonwealth Arts Festival
antho'.ogy, “Young Commonwealth
Poets ’65”, make the book sound as
though it is going to be, firstly, a volume
in the compilation of which the editors
of the various sections will have their
critical faculties engaged by silly com-
petition for space, and, secondly, a
volume some of the main conditions of
entry to which may be taken by young
poets as an indication of the One True
Way their work should follow.
So God help the editors and poets,
both.
There are, for example, these terms
in Mr Macainsh’s invitation: “Work pre-
ferred is that which exhibits a break
from prevailing ‘safe’ attitudes and,
ideally, is representative of a new poetic
generation. Experimental and socially
responsive work is particularly sought.”
Why this virtually dogmatic emphasis
on the desirability of “social” subject-
matter, almost at the expense of true
poetry-writing which sustains all subject-
matter? If Mr Macainsh’s anthology
had been projected slightly earlier in
time, what then would have been ac-
corded most priority for inclusion—a
Furnley Maurice social cry, or (say)
Shaw Neilson’s “Mushrooms”, which is,
of course, devoid of social content but
survives by reason cf its sheer lyricism,
its intrinsic beauty of words? (That ugly
word “sociological”, by the way, actually
appeared in a metropolitan daily news-
paper piece advertising Mr Macainsh’s
anthology and its aims; and where did
the paper pick up the word if not from
a Commonwealth Arts Festival pub-
licity “hand-out”?)
These days it is becoming more and
more impossible for writers and other
persons who (rightly or wrongly) deem
themselves to be historically informed
about the continuity (past-present-future)
value of art and liteiature to stay toler-
antly silent in the presence of contempor-
ary ill-conceived attitudes or outlooks in
the field of poetry in Australia and else-
where. Criticism, in particular, in Aus-
tralia, although its endeavor to reassess
our literature may be lively enough and,
from the standpoint of vocation,
thoroughly valid, has gone to pot or to
the pack (indeed, there are all sorts of
packs around), and much good poetry
has, as a result, been almost wilfully
down-graded, miscast, or cast out, while
lesser stuff has been promoted by self-
appointed oracles concerned with their
own promotion.
Commonsense and breadth of vision,
not predetermined and narrowly pre-
scribed preferences, should guide the act
of selection —and the prospect Mr Mac-
ainsh paints of jealous national rivalry
for unallotted space, or inside run-
ning, is just as alarming as the prefer-
ences are.
God save the Commonwealth!

“Our Lady of the Flowers ”
SIR. —My attention has been drawn to
a short, but damaging, editorial reference
to our titie “Our Lady of the Flowers”, by
Jean Genet (The Bulletin, Dec. 5), in
which it is coupled with “Candy”. While
the latter could be dismissed, or enjoy-
ed, as a pornographic spoof. I cannot
believe your “Plain English” writer could
have read “Our Lady of the Flowers” if
he can mention these two totally different
books in the same breath.
Jean Genet has been acclaimed by the
literary world everywhere as an un-
doubted genius.
When “Our Lady” was published here
by us and by The Grove Press in
America, the critical attention was lavish
and almost wholly in praise of the work
and the writer. If Australians are not
allowed the possibility of reading Genet’s
prose works, I can only respectfully sug-
gest that the system of censorship in
your country is a bit out of step to that
in most parts of the civilised world.

VSO
SIR.—I had been wondering when, if
ever, someone would reply to The
Bulletin article on the VSO (Nov. 28).
Now that one reply has come from a cor-
respondent “in a position to know”, it
turns out to be no repiy at all. The
only point she makes is that the idea
for the new method of orchestral tuning
came from Mr Cluytens and not Mr
Clare. This is about the least important
of the points made in the article, but on
the strength of this she invites us to
dismiss the whole story as “redolent with
untruths”. Not good enough.

Pigs
SIR.—On page 11 of The Bulletin of
December 19 the Moderator of the
Presbyterian Church in NSW was quoted
as saying: “It is not the sty that makes
the pigs, but pigs that make the sty.”
This is an insult to the intelligence of
modern pig breeders and an insult to a
noble animal.
Anyone who knows pigs will tell you
that they are by nature very clean
animals. Give them good living condi-
tions and they will remain clean; unlike
most other animals they will seldom soil
their sleeping quarters if it can be avoid-
ed. In summer the pig likes to keep
cool and given a bath he will bathe
regularly. If, however, he is kept in an
overcrowded, earthen-floored sty he can-
not maintain his clean habits.

The Death Penalty
SlR.—Perhaps it would be best if I tried
to define what seems to have been estab-
lished in this correspondence.
(1) Mr Karpin believes that the death
penalty has a “general brutalising effect”.
Not to put too fine a point on it, I do
not.
(2) Mr Karpin thinks that those who
support the death penalty because they
think it deters “are logically involved in
considering its use in other bad' crimes
(e.g., rape, kidnapping, aggravated
assault)”. I gave my reason for think-
ing that murder might be regarded as in
a special category in this connection in
the second paragraph of my first letter
(The Bulletin, Dec. 5).
(3) Mr Karpin maintains that whereas
his statements about the ghastliness of a
particular hanging are both informative
and emotive. J. Edgar Hoover’s state-
ments about the bestiality of some
criminals are “purely emotive”. I think
Mr Hoover’s statements are informative
too.

FORUM
For a Minority Only
Santaniaria and Lenin
By HENRY MAYER
Politicians make you yawn, the pro-
phet. gives you a shock. I found
the politics of austerity, outlined in
his latest book by Mr B. A. Santamaria*
are very hard to take when I read it at
Christmas after the turkey, and
brandy. That this book should
leave one uneasy and upset is, in itself,
already a considerable achievement.
Even where one disagrees with him most,
one feels that he might just be right.
Santamaria is never stupid, nor, what
would be much worse for a prophet,
does he appear ridiculous.
His book provides but a partial in-
sight into the policies of “The Move-
ment”. It does not, as the preface claims,
enable the reader to discover “exactly
what the ideas of ‘The Movement’ were,
and are.” “The Movement” now the
National Civic Council was formally
established in 1942, and Santamaria him-
self has been a full-time activist in Aus-
tralian politics for over 25 years. Yet, of
the 16 papers and addresses collected
here, only three date before 1960 the
earliest back to 1957. There is plenty of
defence, foreign policy and immigration,
but nothing on Santamaria as the advo-
cate of rural values or the defender of a
productivity index. Moreover, the ideas
here are at a very general level, and to
really understand them it is necessary to
study Santamaria as a practical political
organiser and journalist in the columns
of “News-Weekly”. There is a very long
way from “the challenge of survival” to
haggling over a re-count of the Senate
vote.
The basic ideas are scattered through-
out the chapters and need pulling to-
gether: Australia’s independence and
survival are threatened in the short run
by the Chinese Communists, maybe the
Indonesians, and under some circum-
stances, the Japanese. The Communist
Party hopes and works for a Labor Gov-
ernment which will be neutralist and
which will, ultimately, “do a deal with
Communist power in the Pacific” and
turn Australia into a satellite. Since the
trade unions are subject to Communist
and extreme Left influence, and since
they, in turn, almost dominate the ALP
there is every reason to suppose that in
the absence of a counterforce Commu-
nist policy may succeed. Australia’s sur-
vival is not automatically guaranteed by
our ties with the United States. We oc-
cupy a low priority in America’s world-
wide diplomacy, and have been dragging
our feet on defence. We might well be-
come or already be expendable. To sur-
vive, we must develop our “own com-
pletely adequate and independently con-
trolled military weapon”. (This might in-
clude tactical nuclear weapons.) We
should work for a Pacific Community to
include all those countries which feel
threatened by Communism. There must
be no equivocation about the American
alliance. Defence and foreign policy
must be integrated with major and revo-
lutionary changes in our economic, im-
migration and developmental policy. We
must treble European immigration, admit
selected educated Asians; give aid to
Asia till it hurts, develop the north by
the grant of free land.
Santamaria is vague on just how much
sacrifice all this would involve some-
times it is “Draconian”, at other times
relatively light. But he insists on two
points: This is the only way we can de-
fend ourselves; if you won’t pay the
price, you're saying we are not worth de-
fending. And he does not simply urge
others, such as wheat growers or textile
manufacturers, to surrender their short-
range interests; he knows that the mere
propagation of his views is bound to
arouse religious sectarianism, will lose
jobs and social status for Catholics, might
even threaten State Aid. But all these are
secondary. Survival is the first priority.
This programme is designed to defend
not “the Australia of milk bars, television
and hire purchase” but rather an “histori-
cal Australia” in which some will be
urged on by the frontier spirit, while
others will again feel “the sense of ad-
venture and even of danger to Christian-
ity. which was the daily experience of the
early Christians . .
How are such revolutionary changes
of policy to be achieved? Not by reliance
on ordinary party politics: “A pro-
gramme designed to save Australia is
also a programme designed to lose elec-
tions; and democratic parties naturally
aim to win, not lose elections.” The only
hope lies in Maritain’s “prophetic shock
minorities”. The NCC as a “small dy-
namic group, freely organised, not con-
cerned with electoral success, devoting
itself to a great social and political idea”
is the embodiment of this concept. But
it cannot do the job alone. The equiva-
lent of the NCC—which functions largely
in the trade unions must be built up
in the parties and the employers’,
farmers’ and professional organisations.
As to their motive power, it is likely
that only Christianity “properly under-
stood” can provide it. Nor would it suf-
fice if such a movement succeeded only
in Australia; it is needed in every demo-
cracy in the Pacific and should have an
international secretariat.

is not so much the particular proposals,
.but rather their interlinkage into an over-
all policy, and, above all the style of
politics they represent. His call is cast in
the mood of what Max Weber called “the
ethic of conscience” a refusal to com-
promise the grand object, a desire to keep
the flame utterly pure as against “the
ethic of responsibility”, or reconciliation
and bargaining. Santamaria makes some
attempt to stress that most of his policies
will have unpleasant consequences. He is
an anti-Benthamite who, for the sake of
the supreme objective, “survival”, wants
to minimise pleasure and maximise, if
not pain, then at least discomfort. He has
not really thought out just what political
action his proposals would involve: By
stressing the central importance of “will”
he seems to suggest that the whole mat-
ter is one of change of heart plus a heavy
burden of taxation. Yet it is pretty clear
that his policies would demand a highly
planned and controlled society, in which
the Government must coerce those who
are not willing to make sacrifices.
It is very difficult to put any of the
conventional labels on the programme
sketched here. It is, certainly, very radi-
cal. If Communists are to be equated
with “the Left”, then he is of “the
Right”. But the equation is meaningless
in both cases. Moreover, even if we are
to consider Santamaria as an advocate of
the “radical Right”, it is clear that people
who have some basic assumptions in
common can be utterly opposed in mood.
Donald Horne’s “The Lucky Country”
also starts from the premise of a threat
to our survival. Yet Horne is irreverent,
likes the affluent society, turns his
“vision" on and off at will, i$ strongly
anti-religious (in the sense of being pro-
pagan) and implies that it is a matter
not so much of “will” but of intelligence.
HThe overwhelming importance Santa-
maria attaches to “will"’ is one of the
two major similarities between his con-
ception of how to do things and that of
Lenin though of course they differ on
what is to be done. For Lenin, there
were no fortresses which Bolsheviks
could not storm. For Santamaria Austra-
lia is to be revitalised by the “will” of a
minority. Secondly, both Santamaria and
Lenin highlight the crucial role of organ-
isation in politics. What Santamaria says
is pretty obvious, but it contrasts favor-
ably with the hot air about individual
action in the social sphere one usually
gets from Christians. There is also a
superficial parallel between Lenin's “van-
guard” and Santamaria’s “prophetic
shock minority”. But for Lenin the van-
guard had scientific insight into the
objective laws of history, while Santa-
maria's minority is fallible, and its vision
is to be checked by other organised
groups in society. It is here that Christian
beliefs play an important part; it is they
with their stress on original sin and falli-
bility which prevent Santamaria from
putting forward a standard elitist con-
ception. (Reviewers such as John Pringle
who complain about Santamaria’s
“rigidity” must have missed the many
passages in which he stresses the contin-
gent and provisional nature of political
judgments.)
Does Santamaria, who is very well
aware of how a democratic society works
in practice, really believe his programme
has any chance of being accepted? At
times he sees himself as a lone voice and
thinks that those willing to act with him
need “a vision as distant and a patience
as complete as that of the Communist”.
If so, there is little hope, For, whatever
else may be said about “visions”, they
are not something you can teach people
to have.
In a democracy, political action must
normally have a pretty low priority in
people's lives. Pluralism involves the
right to be apathetic. Santamaria admits
that only a very few will take on the per-
sonal sacrifices involved. Defeating Com-
munists in the trade unions is one thing.
It is surely a different matter if the min-
ority is told that this, difficult as it is, is
only the beginning of a seemingly endless
road: You must work in most major
parties and groups (not just in the trade
unions), change most major Australian
policies, and then go on to convert Paci-
fic Governments and the United States.
To give courage to his followers,
Santamaria must inflate the “prophetic
shock minority”. He claims that his be-
liefs on foreign policy and his list of
priorities which subordinates every-
thing to the “survival” objective “are
the fundamental premises of nearly half
a million voters in Australia”. This is
quite ridiculous there is a very long
road from the NCC activist to the
ordinary DLP voter. After all, merely
voting for the DLP without even joining
it, let alone working in it, is hardly
any “sacrifice”. It is a merit of the book
that Santamaria makes it very clear that
his policies are bound to bring about
divisions amongst Catholics, both bishops
and laity. Yet, we are also told that “most
active Catholic trade unionists” who, a
few lines later, are transformed into “the
average Catholic trade unionist”, agree
with him about the Chinese threat and
the nature of the ALP.
If, as Santamaria thinks it must, “The
Movement” were to spread beyond the
bounds of the trade unions and the ALP
it would become increasingly divided.
Such divisions are also likely to increase
as the programme becomes more ambi-
tious. And one of the strangest things
about this book is that there is no con-
sideration at all—apart from two lines
on page seven of the foreign and de-
fence policies of the present Govern-
ment. After all, it is they who have been
in power since 1949, and it is they, and
not the Opposition, who bear formal re-
sponsibility.
Santamaria states, correctly, that for-
eign policy decisions are mainly made by
the ruling group. If so, it is not clear
why he never even considers sending,
say, half of his 30 NCC organisers and
some of his “prophetic shock minority”
into the ranks of the Liberal Party for
a change.


OVERSEAS
On Jamaica’s Gold Coast
The overcrowded islands in the sun
From GEORGE McGANN in Kingston
Since this lovely Caribbean isle
severed its ancient colonial ties
with England two years ago and
achieved independent Commonwealth
status, it has been drawn sharply into
the orbit of the tremendous centripetal
force exerted by the United States of
America. On my first visit to the island
since it achieved full freedom in Aug-
ust of 1962 —actually my first prolonged
stay in more than ten years—l have
been forcibly struck by its Americanisa-
tion. In some respects, probably be-
cause of the common English language,
Jamaica seems closer to the US than
does the latter’s Commonwealth of
Puerto Rico. Jamaica's two radio
stations (one Governmental and the
other commercial) blare forth the four-
beat adolescent Beatle-music of the
mainland. Television is in its infancy
and there are few sets to be watched at
the moment, but I have no doubt they
will shortly reflect the image of popular
American programming. I am sure,
too, that the Beverly Hillbillies will even-
tually be better known to the average
Jamaican than the Maroons who inhabit
his blue mountains.
The all-too-familiar pot-bellied, cam-
era-slung, mad-hatted figure of the
American tourist is visible everywhere
in Jamaica, from the crowded, steamy
streets of the capital city, Kingston, to
the breeze-swept beaches of the North
Shore resorts of Port Antonio, Ocho
Rios and Montego Bay. It must be
emphasised that tourism, under a Gov-
ernment-sponsored and financed promo-
tion programme centred in New York,
has become the number three “indus-
try” in the island, with 85 per cent of
the tourists coming from the US and 11
per cent from Canada (all of these in-
distinguishable from their Yankee neigh-
bors in speech, dress or spending habits).
The remaining four per cent of visitors,
from Latin America or Europe or wher-
ever, are simply lost among the hordes
of invaders from North America.
In addition, the island’s numher one
industry—bauxite mining and exporting
-—is dominated by the big four alumin-
ium companies of North America: Rey-
nolds, Kaiser, Alcoa and Alcan (of Can-
ada). The number two industry, pro-
duction of sugar and rum and shipping
of bananas and other fruits, has tradi-
tionally been geared principally to
American markets.
The island’s other export, surplus
population, which unfortunately is rapid-
ly outstripping all tolerable bounds) also
looks to North America for outlets, now
that Britain has put a full stop to the
stream of ten thousand migrants yearly
from Jamaica. The outlook for altera-
tion of the severe American and Cana-
dian quota systems in operation against
Jamaicans and other Caribbean Islanders
is rather bleak, however. The US obvi-
ously has quite enough problems with
its native black population and its steady
stream of citizens migrating from Puerto
Rico to New York City. Canada has
never been eager to alter the pattern of
its primarily Anglo-Saxon immigration.
Jamaica, with more than 1,750,000
people confined within an area of 4411
square miles—the island is only 150
miles long and less than fifty miles
across —is suffering acutely from the
population explosion. Unless drastic
measures are swiftly taken, Jamaica will
approach China in acute overpopulation.
At its present rate of growth, the Jam-
aican population within a quarter-cen-
tury can be expected to double, thus
creating a density of 750 persons per
square mile (compared to present fig-
ures of 311 for India and 671 for
Japan).
One obvious solution to the popula-
tion problem, widespread use of modern
birth control methods, has been obstruct-
ed by lack of Government support. In
this connection it is noteworthy that al-
though the bulk of the population is of
the Protestant faith, principally Church
of England, the Prime Minister, Sir
Alexander Bustamente, and his Health
Minister, Herbert Eldermire, who is
directly concerned with mass birth
control methods, are both Roman
Catholics. The Government recently
took the position that it would
not “compel anyone to adopt birth
control’’ but would “provide facilities
for those who voluntarily request it”.
Even this relatively neutral attitude was
condemned by the Roman Catholic
Church in Jamaica, which warned
against the “brainwashing of Catholics
and pressure for sterilisation”.
But despite the overcrowding of the
island and consequent chronic un

employment, there is no starvation.
Nature has been so kind and so lavish
in this land where the sun shines twelve
months of the year and the trees bear
a profusion of tropical fruits and the
surrounding seas teem with fish, that it
is possible to spend a lifetime in idle-
ness and never know true hunger.
• This is one of the reasons for the
island’s relative political stability, in a
sea where Cuba’s Fidel Castro has raised
the banner of Communist revolution
only 90 miles away and where dictator
Francois Duvalier has caught Haiti in
an iron grip on another nearby shore.
The placid nature of the Jamaican, plus
the tradition of 300 years of more-or-less
enlightened British rule, lend the Gov-
ernment a prestige and authority lack-
ing in similar small countries in the
Caribbean and Latin America. The two-
party parliamentary system of govern-
ment is apparently firmly entrenched in
Jamaica, thanks to the British influence.
Radio Havana is beaming the Castro
message of revolution nightly to Latin-
American countries to the south. The
message comes in loud and clear but the
Jamaicans are not listening—not even to
the English-language sessions.
Tamaican politics are dominated by the
** conservative Jamaica Labor Party,
now in power under venerable Sir Alex-
ander Bustamente, and the People’s
National Party, a nominally Lettish
group dominated by Bustamente’s cousin,
Norman Manley. Incidentally, Sir Alex-
ander, a tall, handsome octogenarian, is
the film negative version of Sir Robert
Menzies. Both Bustamente and Manley
are light-colored Negroes. Although
99 per cent of the Jamaican population
possess Negro blood, social and political
success seem easier for those with lighter
skin coloration, a fact noted by novelist
Alec Waugh in his controversial “Island
in the Sun,” supposedly based on the
color situation in Jamaica.
Both the JLP and the PNP (which
was in power for seven years) have
shown themselves friendly to foreign in-
vestment and controlled exploitation of
Jamaican resources. Tax benefits are
given to foreign (principally American)
manufacturers seeking reduced labor and
production costs. Foreign investors
held back temporarily after Jamaica
achieved full independence, but after
observing the conservative nature of
Bustamente’s rule and the absence of
authentic threats to nationalise industries,
the overseas industries, headed by the
aluminium giants, have been coming to
the island, setting up factories and mak-
ing use of the large labor pool. Un-
fortunately for Jamaica, there are no
important local power sources for big
industry.
Jamaica is one of the most beautiful
soots on earth, as noted by Columbus,


who discovered it on his second voyage
in 1494. The north shore, traversed
by a highway from Montego Bay to Port
Antonio, has the most beautiful scenery
—and attracts most of the tourists. It
also boasts homes owned by Noel Cow-
ard, the late Lord Beaverbrook and
many American millionaires. Its Gold
Coast, extending from the Montego Bay
section eastward to Ocho Rios, is coming
to resemble, unfortunately, the Florida
shore in the proliferation of luxury
hotels.
Doctor’s Cave Beach at Montego is
one of the favorite gathering places of
the international set. . It is supposedly
highly exclusive. One needs a member-
ship card or authorisation from a top
local hotel to get past the guard at
the gate. Nevertheless I was solicited
on Doctor’s Cave Beach by two prosti-
tutes within minutes after I had applied
my suntan lotion and was settling down
for a mid-morning’s snooze. The inci-
dence of prostitution on Jamaica is not a
statistic made available by the Tourist
Board. But a fortnight’s exposure on
the roads of the North Shore resorts
and on the streets of Kingston lead me
to the unofficial conclusion that it must
be the world's highest. “Want to go
with me, sah?” is the musical phrase
used by these teenage houris.
With this situation obtaining, I was
surprised to note that the Playboy Club
of America, with its synthetic approach
to sex and its “look but don’t touch”
attitude toward its bunnies, had opened
up a hotel branch in Ocho Rios. Cynical
local observers, openly dubious about
the possibility of retaining that hands-
off tradition in Jamaica, predicted it
would soon be known as “the Hare
House”.
Australians will become more con-
scious of Jamaica w'hen Qantas begins its
Mexican-Caribbean operations. Jamai-
cans expect many Australian visitors for
the Test cricket early this year and, of
course, the Commonwealth Games of
August. 1966, can be expected to attract
many athletics enthusiasts from Austra-
lia and New Zealand.
However, a word of warning should
be injected here. Three Kingston hotels
have closed dowm recently, notably the
large but out-dated Myrtle Bank Hotel.
With the bulk of tourists by-passing
Kingston for the more fashionable North
Shore, Kingston hotels have been suffer-
ing financial losses. But visitors to the
Kingston Games, including officials and
Press, to say nothing of the general
public, wall have “the devil’s own time
of it" to find a place to lay their heads.
I am not in the least worried. 1 have a
spot picked out under a papaw tree
about a hundred yards from the Sta-
dium’s main gate.
Fifteen Miles to Freedom
By PETER PETRUSEV
In the shining spring of 1962, I came
to Batumi, a small town on the
Black Sea coast, with a manuscript
the front page of which bore the title
“Man Seeks a Future”. It was not my
first step in writing, though my previous
works were nothing to boast about. I
wrote articles on Communist Labor
Teams for local newspapers like “Kom-
somol Truth” and “Red Flag” in a big
industrial city in Western Siberia.
I was considered to be well qualified
for such articles, as
I had some technical
education and, un-
like other news-
papermen, made
fewer mistakes in
specifically technical
questions. However,
I was instantly re-
proved for any
attempt to write
about anything other
than cheerful work-
men proud of their
records. It naturally
threw me into the
necessity of writing
for myself; that is, as a Soviet poet once
said, “into the table drawer”.
I knew that it was crazy to expect
such a book to be published in Russia.
I travelled through most of my country
as a competitive swimmer and had some
idea about its different parts. Some-
how I had heard about the writers who
managed to smuggle their manuscripts
abroad through foreign tourists. It is
the deepest desire of any writer, I think,
to see his work published in his own
language and in his own country. But
IVJR PETER PETRUSEV, who now
lives in Melbourne, escaped from
Russia into Turkey in 1962 by swim-
ming from Batumi on the Black Sea
15 miles to a small village across the
border. He believes he is one of only
eight escapees . successful in their at-
tempt to cross the Russian-Turkisli
frontier in the past three or four years.
He recalls a popular saying among the
frontier guards: “Out of a hundred
trespassers 99 are caught and the last
one is shot.”
it is not always possible, unfortunately.
Other means are then used to free one-
self from the burden of unrevealed dis-
coveries about the human soul.
I placed great hopes on Batumi,
famous resort often visited by tourists
from Western Germany and other free
countries. I studied German so that it
might be possible to have direct contact
with them. However, all my prepara-
tions of this kind were nothing com-
pared to the difficulties I faced.
First of all I had
to settle down, be-
cause any improvi-
dent move made in
a hurry could lead
to disastrous conse-
quences. Batumi is a
city of great attrac-
tion to migrants
from all parts of
Russia. It has a per-
fect climate and is
probably the most
carefree town in
Russia.
I was lucky
enough to swim a
good time in backstroke not long before.
A swimmer of this particular style was
needed by a Georgian team for the
forthcoming Spartakiada of the Peoples
of USSR.
A few days later I was appointed as
a tool designer in a local factory, though
I was not an engineer, and commenced
my job in—a swimming pool. Soon I be-
came too careless in my approach to
people from the Intourist hotel; my love
for political anecdotes was not disguised

THE PRINCELY HOLIDAY
GIO
any more and ... a call from the Lecu-
rity Committee followed.
I spent eight hours in a gloomy build-
ing on Primorskaya Street, where I was
questioned about my religious beliefs,
if any, my knowledge of foreign lan-
guages (even about Turkish—Batumi is
located some 15 miles from the Turkish
border).
I thought that my goose was cooked,
but, surprisingly enough, they let me go
with advice to leave Batumi —and the
sooner the better. “Surely it was because
they did not know anything about my
book,” passed through my mind.
I was quiet for a few days—until I
realised that I was constantly shadowed
by Security men.
I found myself in a mouse-trap. The
thought of escape inland was discarded
as completely impossible. Railway sta-
tion and airport were under constant sur-
veillance of Security anyway and even
if I could delude my personal “tail” I
would not get through this way. The
only highway inland could be blocked
immediately. The trip through im-
passable mountains was a sure way to
suicide, if the beaten tracks were to be
avoided.
Then I remembered that I was a
swimmer and hope revived in me. The
blue waves of the Black Sea led to the
land of the half-moon and star. Only
15 miles of sea space separated me from
freedom—a distance I had swum hun-
dreds of times during my training. At
that time I thought not about any other
freedom but freedom from fear and
oppression, humiliating experience of
persecution for views that I believed to
be true.
During trips at night on a small
pleasure-cruiser with groups of holiday-
makers a few miles from the shore, I
longingly looked to Turkey, the un-
known land. But a long chain of search-
lights that lit up the sea as bright as day
soon after the last rays of the sun sunk
behind the horizon, and a long line of
patrol vessels that took the duty from
them farther along the sea, made me
feel that even a seagull would not slip
unnoticed through the gap between two
worlds.
I calculated the time between the
lighting of searchlights and early dawn
when the sea became observable from
watch-towers again. It was the time
(about seven hours) for me to cover 15
miles. When I compared it with my
usual speed (I was not a long-distance
swimmer unfortunately) the result was
not very promising.
How I did not give up hope at that
time I do not know. There was no
possibility for any long-term prepara-
tions: arrest could take place any day.
Nevertheless I began to use rubber fins
and heavy lead bracelets for legs and
hands during training. It inspired sur-
prise only from my coach (an impor-
tant competition was near) but no sus-
picion, because this type of training is
not unusual in Russia. I read books about
Black Sea currents and studied maps.
After all these preparations I found
myself as helpless and ignorant about
escape as at the beginning. The greatest
danger remained unchecked —the search-


lights. I felt that I needed to do some-
thing to restore my belief for success
before I threw myself into the waves of
the Black Sea with no hope for return
to my native land.
One night I succeeded in shaking off
my “tail”. I went home, read a book
and listened to the radio for a while,
then switched off the lights as though
going to bed. After tyfif an hour, I
jumped through a toilet Window into the
backyard and ran to the sea.
I do not know how long 1 stayed in
the sea that night. I worked out the
most comfortable posture underwater:
body bow-shaped, so that only the
uppermost part of the back slightly
touched the surface, hands by knees and
slow strokes downwards to keep the
body submerged—and no nerves loose.
That night gave me confidence—so
needed for my enterprise. Now I felt
that I had burnt my boats and had
nothing to do with all around me.
The last three days before my escape
seemed a nightmare. Everything was
ready for escape to the last trifle. The
most important papers were sealed in a
waterproof packet. Three strong strings
were attached to a specially prepared
belt. One was for a knife, the other for
a compass and the last for a needle,
with which I could transfix a muscle,
should cramp affect it. Fitted rubber
fins were wrapped in a towel and placed
into a net bag together with a piece of
soap and sponge—my love for late sea-
baths was well known.
Waiting for waves
HThe only thing that stopped me from
starting was a dead, still sea. Any
phosphorescent splash of water could
betray me in such weather. Three long
days I waited for waves to come. Even
a storm would have been a fortune for
me. I felt that the circle around me
tightened every day. It was improbable
that Security men did not notice my
tensed behavior during these last days.
They only waited for some sign which
would give away my plans. I do not
really think that they anticipated my
escape—the idea would seem completely
crazy to anyone.
Finally, the day came. A light breeze
caressed the sea. The air of unrest
that spread from it made me surprisingly
self-possessed for the first time during
the last days. I quietly swam out my
daily distance, told a few funny stories
to my coach and went to a film in the
early evening.
After coming home. I put on all my
gear, covered it with my track-suit,
switched off the light and lay on the
bed. It was seven o'clock on June 16,
1962. I had to wait two hours before
I could plunge into the waves of the
Black Sea. Two hours that could
destroy all my neatly-prepared plans. It
was just the right time for “them” to
come. With my hand grasping the
knife’s handle, I listened to the sounds
outside and thought . . . One day I will
remember what I thought about and will
tell it to someone or write a very, very
small book with a caged bird on its
cover.
At a quarter to nine I took the highest
dose of dope (phenamin) with a few
ampoules of glucose, then climbed
through a toilet window into the back-
yard. Then I quietly walked towards
the sea, swinging my net bag and whist-
ling the melody of my favorite song.
When I approached the sea, its
appearance calmed me again. Moderate
waves disturbed its surface and a moon
was hidden behind the clouds. Not very
far from the shrubs where I hid, I
heard two people talking. They could
have been peasants but they could have
been frontier guards detail. There was
no time to find out. Every minute the
searchlights could go on and make me
visible from the shore if I could not
swim far enough away.
I hid my clothes under a tree and
dived into a creek. I let it carry me
freely till I felt that the water became
warmer and its taste saltier. Then I
took a quick breath and dived again
and again farther into the open sea.
Finally the long beams of light whip-
ped the sea. They reached out for me
like gigantic tentacles of a monster. I
dived like a duck until I was about six
miles from the shore and stopped worry-
ing about them at all. The dazzling
strips of light died away before reaching
me. I even began to enjoy myself, en-
tertained by a small dolphin that played
and jumped in the water nearby. How-
ever it was very premature joy.
Suddenly I felt that something went
terribly wrong with the searchlights.
Either I came closer to them or they
moved their beams far into the sea. It
was luck that the first round of a patrol
vessel’s searchlight did not fall directly
on me. I had time to dive before it
reached me. I realised that there were
many of them, waiting for me. The
danger was in their sudden approach
and the uncertainty about the point
which the searchlight strikes first.
After two or three hours of continu-
ous work, I began to change the styles
of swimming more often, because I felt
a bit tired. The rubber fins, though
they allowed me to swim faster, tired my
muscles more than I expected. The
water grew colder and even a short rest
or a slowing of pace resulted in goose
pimples over my body. I did not fore-
see that the cold waters of the mountain-
born River Chorokh penetrated so far
into the sea. I thought that I had passed
its mouth long before.
A strong current made me drift. Some-
times I found myself swimming directly
into the open sea, sometimes I saw the
summits of the mountains just in front
of me. All my sensations were sharp-
ened to an unnatural height. The be-
traying bend of my toe made me think
what would happen if I got cramp in
my leg.
One little favor
if someone was near, I would not
shout for help, of course. A funny
thing, I thought I was a very determined
atheist, but I found myself whispering in
desperation: “God, help me to survive
this hour. I suffered too much not to
deserve one little favor from You—life.”
I promised myself never to come near
the sea —the sea that I loved so much
and regarded as my most reliable friend.
However, I thought it too early to
give up and forced my legs to work
with gentle fish-like strokes and took my
needle out to be sure. Luckily, the
water became warmer again. I had
passed the cold current and maybe had
survived.
The last searchlight, hidden in a bay,
was the most powerful of all. Also, I
began to swim towards the shore, be-
cause otherwise I would have passed the
tip of a long peninsula and hopelessly
increased the gap between myself and
the land.
Then . . . the light moved away. I
could not believe it in the beginning.
“Bless the negligence of those fellows
who stood on the rotating deck of the
searchlight,” I thought. “I owe my life
to them.”
Dawn was just beginning and a mist
rose from the sea. Yet I could see only
the summits of mountains maddeningly
far away.
It is almost incomprehensible why
salvation usually comes at the very last
moment. I felt that I was sinking; mist
in my eyes and a mist outside. I thought
that I was miles in the sea when my
knees struck something solid. Nearly
unconscious, I dragged myself upon the
rocks and fell exhausted.
After half an hour or so the sun rose
and cleared away the mist. I was lying
on a beautiful beach—l thought it was
beautiful—at the foot of a precipice.
Human nature is inexhaustible: almost
running, I ascended the sheer slope. A
small village with a mosque in its heart
lay beneath my feet.
Soon, with a numerous crowd of
Turkish peasants, armed with anything
one could lay hands upon, I was escorted
to the village where even a larger crowd
of children and adults met me with
mighty shouts: “Tarzan! Tarzan!”
I seemed great to myself, greater than
Tarzan himself, though exhausted and
dishevelled in appearance, but im-
measurably happy.
The sun was high by then —a different
sun.


REVIEWS
THEATRE
Durrenmatt’s Fanatics
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
The Marriage of Mr Mississippi. Friedrich
Dunenmatt. Independent Theatre, Sydney.
Louis and Paul are the fatherless sons
of streetwalkers who grew up side by
side in the gutter with the rats. Perhaps
because of the untidiness of their origins
both developed a passion for order: they
became fanatical moralists, each wishing
to impose his own vision of justice upon
the whole world. One was inspired by
a tattered copy of “Das Kapital”, the
other by a tattered copy of the “Old
Testament"’. Having made themselves
rich by opening a brothel in partner-
ship, each equipped himself with a splen-
did new name and set out to remake the
world. Louis (Frederic Rene Saint-
Claude), believing that Communism had
become a farce in the East, worked to-
wards a new World Revolution, while
Paul (Florestan Mississippi), believing
that Christianity had become a farce in
the West, worked towards the restoration
of the Law of Moses.
While Louis was becoming a top
Communist in the East (as a preliminary
manoeuvre), Paul became Public Prose-
cutor in a Western country and devoted
himself to carrying out the Law of Moses
by ruthlessly hounding criminals to the
gallows.
There is also a third idealist, the
aristocratic Count Bodo von Übelohe-
Zabernsee. He is a Christian who be-
lieves in love and devotes himself to
good works.
All three are ruined by a woman
(Olympia) who is, of course, completely
without morality of any kind.
As usual w'ith Diirrenmatt (as with
many serious dramatists at present), we
are presented, through a mixture of
farcical extravaganza, wild melodrama
and a glittering display of wit, satire and
intellectual pyrotechnics, with the black-
est possible vision of life. These plays are
like the lumps of poison, looking exactly
like sugar, which, with Borgia-like per-
sistence, everyone keeps dropping into
everyone else’s coffee in this play.
Just as, at the end of “The Physicists”,
the world was left in the hands of the
mad psychiatrist, Doktor Mathilde von
Zahnd, so, at the end of “The Marriage
of Mr Mississippi”, love and morality
having been defeated, the world is left
to the venal Diego, who is interested only
in power.
But, although it is confected with skill
and is very funny at times, “The
Marriage of Mr Mississippi” never be-
comes airborne in the way that “The
Visit” and “The Physicists” do. Like
the late-bourgeois drawing-room in which
it is set, furnished with assorted pieces
of Louis Seize, Quinze, Quatorze, Empire,
Rococo, Japanese and Gothic, this play
seems to me a hotchpotch of old ideas,
cleverly manipulated but not re-
invigorated.
The only character who really comes
to life is Saint-Claude the Communist,
played with wonderful verve by Owen
Weingott. That most of the others
seem like rather battered props, fished
out from the cupboard of past literature,
is the fault of the dramatist, not the
actors. I do not know how any actor
could make Mr Mississippi seem any
more than a dramatist’s whim, but per-
haps this is just because in my limited
experience I have not come across any-
one who wished to reintroduce the
Mosaic Law. Although Saint-Claude is
pretty much a stock figure of a revolu-
tionary, he is at least recognisable.
Nevertheless, I doubt if pure Marxian
Communism is any more of an ever-
present threat than the Mosaic Law.
Ken Hannam’s production keeps the
farce rattling along pretty merrily with
the aid of all Diirrenmatt’s theatrical
tricks, including beginning the play at
the end and working backwards and for-
wards to the beginning, but it is a pity
he has been unable to resist the pro-
ducers’ vice of lily-gilding by adding extra
slapstick business.
For the acting, it is Owen Weingott’s
evening, particularly in his Communist
phase when he is wearing his Fidel-like
beard and costume. Ronald Morse’s
performance in the difficult part of Mr
Mississippi improves as the evening
wears on because Mr Mississippi begins
to seem almost human when everyone
starts betraying him. Anne Haddy as
Olympia has little opportunity to do
more than look attractive and inscrutable,
which she does.
Alice’s Dream
Alice in Wonderland. Tivoli Theatre, Mel-
bourne.
A production of “Alice in Wonder-
land” which sticks close to the
original should, in theory, appeal only
to children above the age of nine. Noel
Ferrier, at the Tivoli, proves that this
does not apply in practice. His version
is not a pantomime but it seems to give
pleasure to all age groups: the little ones
like it for its movement and color; older
children lap up the situations and their
parents applaud nostalgically.
As a poor foreigner I have never
understood what children can make of
Lewis Carroll, and I still don’t. But the
evidence is there, and this a delightful
show, with very little jazzing up. With-
out recourse to Tenniel, the costumes
glitter as in a fancy pack of cards. The
traditional songs tickle the ear, but those
specially written are a bit flat. There
is nothing either ornate or slapdash
about the performance which advances
from the assumption that “Alice” needs
no explanations.
Pat Carroll acts Alice with a
pretty blend of humility and enthusi-
asm, although she has no singing voice.
Bill Hodge is a Duchess straight out of
Toorak and Terry Norris makes a great
go of Humpty Dumpty and the Queen
of Spades. Bobby Bright and Laurie
Allen marry the concept of The Beatles
to Tweedledum and Tweedledee, and
Brian Crossley, as the White Rabbit,
holds the surrealist gang together with
the greatest aplomb. William Orr did
the adapting, and he did it well.

approach to filming. Subject matter is of
prime importance to him he generally
works on his own scripts —so that
while his use of the cinema medium is
expert and original, his filming is never
a mere empty exercise in technique. He
handles his actors with a fine mixture
of understanding and discipline, probably
because he understands the actor’s job,
having starred notably in two of his own
films seen here, “II Ferroviere” and “A
Sordid Affair”.
His preoccupation is with the effect on
human behavior of accepted yet often
false social standards. This was the theme
of “Divorce Italian Style”, which
established his international reputation,
and in “Seduced and Abandoned” he
again studies with savage humor the
social scene in provincial Sicily. This is
a society built on paradox the con-
trast between the moral code and true
morality, the tight family unit which
ignores family love. So the seduced girl
receives no pity or help, merely the show
of affection in public and in private vitu-
peration as a strumpet and a disgrace.
Germi concerns himself particularly
with the status of women in this society,
where, although men are expected to
prove their manhood by sexual promis-
cuity, the mere hint of female unchastity
means ostracism.
From this apparent sociological tract
Germi has made a rich, uproarious film,
often hilariously funny despite its basic
seriousness. Though sharply observant of
his characters’ foibles, Germi presents
them as humans, not symbols victims
of the world they live in.
Only towards the end he lapses briefly
into slightly hysterical indignation; he
soon recovers and in the last few frames
sums up his theme with wordless bril-
liance.
Germi lovingly records the harshly
picturesque Sicilian scene (crumbling
white buildings under a merciless' sun
parched landscape) but always uses his
camera to comment, not simply to re-
cord.
Intelligent, mobile use of camera is a
feature too of Gordon Douglas’ lively
“Rio Conchos”, a curious mixture of
old and new. It has the traditional West-
ern virtues of speed and violence, and its
spacious, open-air atmosphere ignores the
television-screen influence which has
brought a different, smaller dimension
to the Western.
Lively performances from Richard
Boone, Edmund O'Brien and Anthony
Franciosa and Jerry Goldsmith's as usual
imaginative musical score add to the
entertainment of Douglas' active but dis-
ciplined direction, which in its final, ex-
plosive scene could serve as a model for
any budding director.

Nero’s Bride
Monteverdi: L’lncoronazione di Poppea,

of the Glyndebourne Festival company,
with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra,
conducted by John Pritchard. HMV

(soprano), Christa Ludwig (mezzo),

The plot of Monteverdi's “L’lncorona-
zione di Poppea”, as Raymond Leppard
points out in the notes that accompany
this excellent Glyndebourne performance
of his own edition of the work, is per-
haps the least moral in all opera. Wrong
triumphs without any expressions of dis-
approval and the opera ends with a
love duet between the lascivious Nero
and the scheming Poppea, who, having
brought all their virtuous opponents to
ruin, to all appearances face a happy
future together.
Though amorality may not be a neces-
sary condition of realism it does force
home the point that “L’lncoronazione” is
the first great realist opera; the characters
are all people of flesh and blood, not
moral abstractions, and are all seen more
or less from their own point of view.
This is rare in any period of opera; in
1642, at a time when serious operas
tended to be stocked with two-dimen-
sional figures and heavily loaded with
moral values, it must have been be-
wildering.
The dramatic power and truth of
“L’lncoronazione” come through
strongly in this Glyndebourne perform-
ance. How authentically Leppard has re-
constructed the sketchy surviving score
is a question to be left to specialists; but
the realisation has a satisfactorily 17th-
century sound about it. It was edited for
practical use in a modern opera house,
not for the ideal conditions of a record-
ing studio, and emotionally and dramati-
cally it is thoroughly convincing. Much
the same applies to Leppard’s abridge-
ment of the work: the question whether
it weakens the opera seriously must be
left to those more intimately acquainted
with the full work than the present
writer.
Magda Laszlo gives a richly compel-
ling interpretation of the role of Poppea
and Richard Lewis is an impressive Nero,
but on the whole this is not so much a
virtuoso production as an admirably sty-
lish and consistent one. Conductor John
Pritchard directs the large cast (16 in-
dividual singers in addition to the
chorus) with a sure sense of purpose
and stylistic unity.
For a true virtuoso performance we
can turn to Giulini’s powerful and ex-
citing version of the Verdi Requiem.
One could play it with a number of
parallels between Monteverdi and Verdi
(other than the fact that one composer’s
name incorporates the other, and that
they both wrote their greatest operas in
their seventies). The relevant similarity
between the two works under discussion
is that both baffled their first audiences
by taking a dramatic and humanistic
approach to forms that were customarily
treated in a lofty and abstract manner.
And, .here again, the present perform-
ance lays special emphasis on just this
quality. Giulini does nothing to disguise
the operatic character of the work which
so distressed some of its early critics; the
tumultuous Dies Irae movement comes
out at white heat, and its climax pro-
vides what must be one of the loudest
masses of sound ever impressed into a
gramophone record; the Lacrymosa
shirks none of the sentiment some-
times perilously close to sentimentality
that Verdi gave to it.
The quartet of soloists is about as
perfect as anyone could hope to hear
assembled at one time, and its excellence
is matched by the brilliant playing of the
Philharmonia Orchestra and the balanced
and disciplined singing of the choir. Both
recordings are outstanding on the engin-
eering side; both make distinguished
additions to HMV’s already prestigious
“Angel” series.

BOOKS
The Emperor’s Lost Gods
By GEOFFREY SCOTT
Julian. Gore Vidal. Heinemann. 325. 6d.
The personality of the Emperor Julian
the Apostate is one of the mysteries of
classical history. If he had had a few
notable vices his character would have
been easier to label. But not even the
pious invective or the heated imagination
of the early Christian apologists were
able to suggest anything particularly
horrid about Julian. Except, of course,
religious toleration and that, doubtless,
was a grievous sin in the days when
bishops all over the empire were busy
cursing and anathematising each other
in the name of Arius or Athanasius and
a citizen’s life and property might well
depend on whether he supported the
homoousian or the homoiousian theory
of the Divinity. However, apart alto-
gether from the diatribes of St Gregory
Nazianzus, Julian's life is at least as
well documented as that of many other
Caesars and one might expect to form,
from the Emperor’s own writings as well
as the sober accounts of Ammianus
Marcellinus and others, a reasonably
clear picture of Julian’s character and
the motivation of his actions.
But this is not so. The celebrated
apostate, the Emperor who tried to put
back the clock and revive the fading
worship of the pagan gods, remains a
strangely ambiguous figure. He was at
the same time pedant, mystic, ironist and
man of action. The timid young
student, who was as proud of the lice
in his straggling beard as he was terri-
fied of his imperial kinsmen, grew into
one of Rome's greatest soldiers who,
but for his death in battle at the age of
32, might have rivalled in Persia the
triumphs of an earlier Caesar in Gaul.
The scholar who debated with the most
famous philosophers of the day accepted
the tattered old Olympian fables with
a credulity that astonished many of
Julian's contemporaries as much as it
astonishes a modern historian. Yet I
wonder how seriously Julian really took
the pagan beliefs of the fourth century
—that weird amalgam of Stoic and
Epicurean philosophies, Orphic mysti-
cism and the prettied-up mythology pro-
duced by the fanciful pens of belated
Hellenists?
That Julian hated the “Galileans”, as
he contemptuously called the Christians,
is plainly evident. One reason was that
he had been reared in fear of imminent
death at the hands of his Christian kins-
men of the house of Constantine.
Another was his passionate love for the
arts and literature of Classical Greece
which he associated inextricably with
the glories of Zeus, Apollo and Athene.
But a third, and probably equally
powerful, reason was purely political.
Constantine had seen the Christian reli-
gion as a unifying force in an empire
whose western and eastern halves had
little in common but the name of Rome.
To Julian the Christians were disrup-
tive, quarrelsome fanatics, preaching a
morbid religion that deliberately turned
its back on the sunlight of human
existence. The heroes of antiquity had
created the empire because the gods of
Rome marched with the conquering
legions. How could the empire sur-
vive if Christians taught that its splen-
dors were transitory phantoms com-
pared with life beyond the grave?
It is this complex of beliefs and
motives that makes the Emperor Julian
such a fascinating character. As Gore
Vidal says, he has always been some-
thing of an underground hero in
Europe. His name crops up in strange
contexts in books on witchcraft, magic
and satanism. He came to personify
the last-ditch resistance of the “old
religion” to triumphant Christianity.
His name has been linked, usually ex-
tremely improbably, with relics of pagan
superstition all over the Western world.
Renaissance scholars, looking back nos-
talgically towards Classical Arcadia,
began the task of rescuing his reputa-
tion after centuries of infamy. Gibbon,
in the heyday of the 18th century en-
lightenment, gently chided Julian for
his reverence for silly pagan myths, but
portrayed him much more sympatheti-
cally than he did most of his Christian
antagonists.
Julian and his age provide a rich
quarry for the historical novelist and
Gore Vidal’s book does full justice to
the material. It has been a best-seller
here and overseas and deserves to be.
It is one of the most readable and con-
vincing pieces of historical reconstruc-
tion that has appeared for a long time.
The bulk of the novel consists of a
pseudo-autobiography, supposedly writ-
ten by the Emperor during his last cam-
paign in Persia. Interspersed are the
comments of two of Julian’s old friends,
the philosophers Libanius and Priscus,
who annotate, correct or enlarge on
the narrative as occasion demands. This
device is effective in breaking up Julian’s
long, self-justificatory monologue,
though it must be said that the fictiona-
lised Emperor is no dull story-teller.
His account of his life, from his peri-
lous, murder-haunted boyhood to the
stormy 20 months when he wore the
imperial purple, builds up an engros-
sing picture of the decaying Roman
Empire.
For Julian’s world is decaying, despite
the outward pomps of Rome, Constan-
tinople and Antioch and the victorious
trophies that the Emperor dedicates so
hopefully to the pagan gods. Julian
himself sees the nemesis of Rome in
the barbarians emerging from the dark
Teutonic forests, in the effeminate crea-
tures who swarm in the imperial court
“as numerous as insects on a summer’s
day”, and in the clamorous brawls of
the sectarian Christians.
Julian’s answer is an attempt to
revive the piety of the Golden Age of
Rome, when men took seriously their
duty to the gods and the smoke of sacri-
fices daily blackened the marble of every
temple. If Julian had been by nature
a persecutor, harrying the Christians
like Diocletian, he might conceivably
have had some success. As it is he
proclaims universal toleration and, in
the teeth of fierce Christian animosity,
the surviving pagans have neither the
courage nor the convictions to join the
Emperor’s crusade. Julian’s dreams
peter out into mere antiquarian potter-
ings—restoring an empty, bat-infested
temple here, sacrificing a few white
oxen there. When he visits the grove
of Apollo at Daphne, once one of the
holiest places in the Classical world, he
finds one grubby old priest on duty
and the only sacrificial animal available
is a solitary goose.
If this does not sound like the stuff
of good fiction it is a tribute to Gore
Vidal’s sensitive and evocative writing
that he has brought off his book with
triumphant success. Julian and the
other central characters—his half-crazy
brother Gallus, his wife Helena, the
Emperor Constantius, the rhetoricians,


the ministers and the genera's—are fully-
realised human figures. The background
is firmly but soberly drawn.
A Party Informer
The Ice Saints. Frank Tuohy. Macmillan.
265. 6d
Valparaiso. F. R. E. Nicolas. Gollancz. 235.
“The Ice Saints” is a novel that pretends
to far more than is easily apparent. Rose
Nicholscn, a middle-class English girl,
visits Poland to see her sister Janet, who
has married a Polish university teacher.
Janet's letters home have been cheerful
and happy; but she lives, of course, in
poverty and discomfort. Even in post-
Stalinist Poland there are few commodity
goods, new housing rapidly ages. Her
husband Witek, whom she no longer
appears to love, is a Party member. Rose,
opening his textbook on teaching English,
comes across such texts as “In England
and America the workers are working
for the gain of the capitalists or
‘bosses’ ”.
But Frank Tuohy is too sophisticated
a writer to leave such an obvious con-
frontation. The spotty proletarian English
student (and black marketeer) is con-
demned by Janet, in a hallowed English
middle-class phrase, as an “oick”. Adam
Karpinski, the flashy academic and jour-
nalist with whom Rose has some un-
defined sexual play, is probably not a
pro-Western degenerate but a Party in-
former. With an array of allusive
characterisation of British diplomats and
Polish ex-aristocrats, Tuohy presents a
complicated balance of the horrors of
Communism and the lesser horrors of the
middle classes. And then there are the
cross-cutting sexual tensions, the family
quarrels of Janet and Rose, the possible
duplicity of everyone.
Amongst this tangle Tuohy leads his
basic story an inheritance left to Janet
in England which might be used to get
her son there. The story itself has little
interest, its problems scarcely exist
amongst the qualifications that is the sub-
stance of Tuohy’s Poland. Consistently
readable, “The Ice Saints” nevertheless
seems to lack any purpose or any
urgency. The qualifications become dead-
ening, the middle-class/Communist con-
frontation seems factitious, and the novel
leaves the impression of an elaborately
delicate artifice whose function has been
forgotten in the construction.
F. R. E. Nicolas has, the jacket of
“Valparaiso” explains, written thrillers as
Nicolas Freeling. This is his “first
‘straight' novel’’. Thriller touches remain,
not just in the robbery, helicopter chase
and machine gunning of a yacht. There is
that knowledgeability, distinctive of re-
cent thrillers, about esoteric things—here
wine and sunglasses.
But “Valparaiso” is a “straight” novel.
Not for nothing is Conrad constantly
alluded to. The hero, Raymond Kapitan,
lives alone on his yacht, his main love.
An enigma to many, we are given the
keys, or clues, to his character in flash-
back that juvenile seduction, the girl’s
pregnancy, his being bought off by her
father. Temporarily in the South of
France, his ambition is to sail to Valpar-
aiso. But the yacht has a rotten patch in
the hull, “something that doesn’t show
but is there”, symbolic (it is legitimate to
look for symbolism in a “straight” novel)
of Raymond's own failure. Then Natalie
arrives, a film star recovering. She too
has psychological interest; “to Natalie
love without a sense of sin was a rather
overrated pastime”. She swims naked;
she is also perceptive, and sees that sym-
bol of the rotten hull.
But the novel is not boringly psycho-
logical. There is a continual liveliness of
phrase “small marine engines that are
not incurable whores are the greatest
rarity afloat.” To put too much weight on
the novel's linguistic and epigrammatic
qualities, however, would be unfortunate.
Though there is an incredibly assured
knowingness about the world, this is
never present at the cost of action.
Natalie's love-making with Raymond has
a passionate intensity “She turned
short on her heel. ‘Undress me and put
me down there’ ” —skilfully distin-
guished from that between Raymond and
Dominique the next night.
Beneath the book runs Mr Nicolas’s
dark philosophy of the impermanence
and untrustworthiness of things of this
world. But despair is pointless better,
he epigrammatically suggests, be amused;
“it's always amusing to drink with a
husband one happens to be cuckolding.”

Against Grief
Do not bruise your eyes with weeping.
For you darken my image there:
It does not burn so clear
Alone as in your keeping.
Do not bite your lip to silence
The open emptiness of a scream;
My answering lips have been
A close enough defence.
Do not clench your inturned fingers
So your nails cut half-moons in your
palms;
Along your outstretched arms
The weight of mine still lingers.
Do not lift your breast to shudder
Across a heartbeat cold and slow;
It was never so,
One heart beneath another.
Do not think your shadow longer
When you look down to the ground;
Beloved, you must turn round.
It is mine, and you are stronger.
GEOFFREY DUTTON.
Playing it Cool
The Mankind Thing. Thomas W. Shapcott.
Jacaranda. 225. 6d.
Beastly Australians. Leon Gellert. Hodder
and Stoughton. 15s.
Mr Shapcott is a representative of the
younger generation of poets, who are
affected by the detachment of modern
linguistic philosophy. Even in the
moment of passion they keep a cool
finger on the trigger.
Essentially Mr Shapcott is a philoso-
phical poet, he is searching for “reality”
to use one of his favorite words. How-
ever, he finds that reality will not let
itself be pinned down. In one poem he
writes:
There is no hare fact even of a tree.
There is no proof simple enough to
touch,
no touch we can believe . . .
In a poem about wind and landscape
he writes that “Loss is no more true a
word than gain”. He often speaks about
the “greed” of nature. Even in moments
of beauty he is aware of this greed.
So in one poem children under a green
tree eat “in shade greedily”.
There are other counterpoints to this
central preoccupation. “Bagatelles”
and “Easter Carols” handle Christian
themes. These are wry, brittle set pieces
moving with dance rhythms. I find
them pretentious, derivative and over-
symbolical.
Although Mr Shapcott's philosophy is
sincerely worked out, on the whole his
language is unremarkable. Take for
instance a cliche like “as terrible and
true as wine”. Some of his distortions
of language verge on bathos. I shudder
at a line like “Drunk is jump and sing
and fight”.
He occasionally has good moments.
The whole of “Piano Pieces” is very
beautiful, although I do not understand
the last section of it.
However, in too many of his poems
the machinery heaves, whistles and clat-
ters, but the meaning moves forward
only a few inches.
Leon Gellert is an ex-Romantic poet
turned rascally humorist in later life.
Some of his early verse is very good, but
has been sadly neglected of late. He
is more a Georgian than a Hugh Mc-
Crae-type vitalist. and so is not of much
use to the critic anxious to proclaim
an Australian school of poetry. How-
ever, poems such as “These Men”,
despite its echoes of Brooke, and “House
Mates” still move me much more than
most poems being written by younger
Australian poets today.
In “Beastly Australians” Mr Gellert
presents us with a rhymed menagerie of


Australian fauna. Bernard Hesling’s
drawings are unpretentious and frisky,
as are Mr Gellert’s verses which treat
animals as various as “The Numbat”,
“The Cuscus” and “The Platypus”.
GEOFFREY LEHMANN
Jazzways
Dinosaurs in the Morning. Whitney Balliett.
Phoenix House. 19s.
“That jazz should be written about criti-
cally is doubtful. It is an elusive, subjec-
tive form whose delights are immediate
and often fleeting. It seizes the emotions
and the heart but rarely the head
and few people need instructions on how
to feel.” So writes Whitney Balliett in the
introduction to his first book, “The Sound
of Surprise”, and then, brushing aside his
doubts, proceeds to write about jazz
critically in forty-six pieces which origi-
nally appeared in “The New Yorker” be-
tween 1954 and 1959. “Dinosaurs in the
Morning”, whatever the title suggests, is
a precisely similar collection which
brings his coverage of the jazz scene up-
to-date.
Mr Balliett combines consummate
literary skill with critical acumen: his
writings, piecemeal though they are in
the present volume, are not only sensitive
and thoroughly informed but have a
poetic grace and wit seldom encountered
in jazz journalism.
Writing for a non-specialist magazine,
he does not forget that many of his
readers’ knowledge of jazz is likely to be
sketchy and, accordingly, provides back-
ground where necessary. Because of this,
his reviews, when collected together,
supply a remarkably complete and stimu-
lating survey of the jazz art and its ex-
ponents. Using a currently-released re-
cord or a concert as a springboard, he
dissects, describes and evaluates in such
a way as to not only vividly recall to
one’s ears his topic of the moment but
to intensify one’s understanding. Particu-
larly attractive is Mr Balliett’s lack of
bias: realising that the quality of a per-
formance does not depend on its chrono-
logical position in jazz history, he re-
mains independent of the fiercely parti-
san and contending factions that exist in
the jazz world.
He frequently finds cause to observe
that, during the downward curve of his
career, an artist is likely to lapse into
self-parody. It is a danger that Mr Bal-
liett himself might well beware: many of
his mannerisms, striking as they are (in
fact, for this very reason), leave him
wide open to the parodist. Guilty at times
of over-simplification and over-elabora-
tion for the sake of style and the telling
image, the fact remains that no other jazz
critic can reveal the essence of a musi-
cian or a performance so vividly and so
readably.
TOM PICKERING
Macquarie Revised
Great Australians. Oxford University Press.
ss.
This series of 8000-word brochures
designed to instruct teenagers about the
lives of the fathers of Australian achieve-
ment are a mixed but not very impres-
sive lot. Of those I have looked at,
“John Flynn”, by W. Scott McPheat, is
accurate and well written; Morton Her-
man’s “Francis Greenway” is good on
the architectural side, not so good on
the biographical side; Arnold Shore’s
“Tom Roberts” is one of the current
efforts to do justice to an artist who for
a long time seemed to have been almost
forgotten, but whose great reputation
during his lifetime has been revived and
will grow with the years.
However, when the Oxford Univer-
sity Press comes to paint portraits of
early Australians it continues to pro-
duce the queerest stuff. His contem-
poraries would certainly have difficulty
in recognising Marjorie Barnard’s liter-
ary portrait of Lachlan Macquarie.
The “biography” says he was born in
Mull; he claimed Ulva as “my native
isle”. It suggests that a tradition exists
that his father was “killed in a High-
land brawl”; he seems to have been a
peaceful tenant farmer and miller at
Osmkamull (“mill at the river mouth”),
near Lagganulva. He did not get into
the Army through his Uncle Maclaine
of Lochbuie, but through Alan McLean
of Torloisk; he did not give his wife
two little slave boys for a wedding pre-
sent; he bought them long after his
marriage. He was not “sent to Ceylon
to take over the island from the Dutch”
—he was a captain in Colonel Stuart’s
force which carried out that task. He
did not bury his wife in Bombay because
the Portuguese made difficulty about
burying her at Macao there was
difficulty with the Chinese about send-
ing her remains home. He did not fight
in the storming of Seringpatam in 1799
—he was too ill and watched from
afar. He was not Military Secretary
to the Governor of Bengal as asserted
and was not Deputy Adjutant-General
and Chief of Staff of the Indian Army,
only until superseded en route —of
the Indian force sent to Egypt in 1801.
He did not go to Egypt with his regiment
but on the staff. He was never adjutant
to Lord Harrington—he was Assistant
Adjutant-General of the London District.
He did not travel to Australia in
HMS Hindostan, but in HM storeship
Dromedary. To say that the powers
given to him as Governor were “greater
than those of the King of England” is
balderdash. He did not reinstate
Governor Bligh as Governor for a day
-—there would have been attempts at a
fine lot of hasty hangings if he had done
so! He did not hold his swearing-in
ceremony in front of Government House.
He did not command the 73rd Regiment
in Australia. Simeon Lord was not one of
the builders of Sydney Hospital. The ac-
count of the currency difficulties is all
topsy-turvy —so far from being part of a
tatterdemalion coinage, the “holey dol-
lars” were Spanish—not Mexican —ex-
pressly imported to give Australia its
first ordered coinage.
Macquarie did not “favor” emancipists
—he was emphatic that he merely in-
sisted that they have their rights, when
worthy. The road across the Blue
Mountains was finished in January, not
April, 1815—which makes a great differ-
ence to the magnitude of the achieve-
ment. Dates and spellings of names are
often wrong—e.g., Macquarie’s son born
on March 28, 1814, not March 14.
Jeffery Bent’s first name was not
“Jeffrey”. The stories of several im-
portant situations and disputes are sadly
garbled and inaccurate, or only half
accurate. And, finally, the statement that
“Macquarie did not die of a broken
heart, as it is said, but of an illness con-
tracted in India” is nonsense. His pro-
state gland and a chill seem to have killed
him at a time when he was in a
state of nervous breakdown through his
failure to overcome the effects of the
Bigge Report.

Fallacies of Love
The Penalty of Exile. Edith de Born. Chap-
man & Hall. 235.
Stories 2. Morley Callaghan. Mac Gibbon &
Kee. 235.
Anyone who feels a shameful quickening
of interest upon reading in the blurb to
Edith de Born’s novel that the story
deals with a child prostitute and with a
“past which cannot fail to shock the
reader”, will find himself deservedly
cheated.
There is not a moment’s sensational-
ism in the book. Despite its unlikely
subject this is, for some part at least,
a polished and enjoyable romance. The
child in question, a fourteen-year-old
girl, falls into the philanthropic hands
of two adults, both of whom oddly
enough admit to being concerned prin-
cipally because of the girl's remarkable
beauty. Her gradual “rebirth” under
the guidance of the chief of her bene-
factors is smoothly and persuasively re-
lated.
When in the second section we dis-
cover that she has grown up to be “one
of the best paid models in Paris” the
romance promises to become really
good. But instead of fulfilling this
promise the novel collapses in the most
unexpected and disastrous manner.
That most pernicious of modern
myths, that love changes all, Raises its
ugly head in the short stories of Cana-
dian Morley Callaghan. Love is certainly
the major preoccupation in this, the
second volume of his tales. And though
he occasionally strikes a note of disillu-
sion, the overall effect is of intractable
sentimentality.
He seems to have assumed the task
of helping us bear our unhappy lots
more easily, all that smiling through the
tears, etc. . One “philosophy” which
emerges very strongly is the one illus-
trated in that popular little legend
(hanging on so many lounge-room walls)
about the man who complained he had
no shoes until he met a man, and so on.
I doubt that this is even good
sociology; it is certainly not good litera-
ture.
R. G. HOWARD
Not By Bread Alone
Marx, Engels and Australia. Henry Mayer.
Sydney Studies in Politics. 15s.
At first sight it would be hard to find
a more way-out footnote to history than
the Democratic Association of Victoria
which flourished in Melbourne about 90
years ago while the Paris Commune was
still fresh in memory. But anyone who,
like me (and obviously like Henry
Mayer), is soft on sects will enjoy this
study of the small group of reformers
who not only tried to popularise the
ideas of French socialists, English radi-
cals and American spiritualists but who
became the first Australian Marxists.
(Since many of them were spiritualists,
Marx would not have welcomed them,
but he wrote their Manifesto and they
became the Australian section of the
First International.)
Mayer does not exaggerate the im-
portance of his sect. Its influence was
slight. But while the story of its in-
effectual earnestness, as Mayer claims, is
a moving one, the main value of a study
like this is the way it shows the simple
fact that many Australian historians
still do not realise: that even in a so-
called materialist colony like Victoria
men did not live by bread and gold
alone.
The second half of the book lists
every reference made to Australia by
Marx and Engels. This is a job that
had to be done some time and Mayer
has done it once and for all. It also
has some general value: Marx and
Engels obviously hated Australia as a
brute fact which, with its migrants and
its raw materials, wrecked their beauti-
ful theory of the impending collapse of
capitalism. Listen to Engels on Austra-
lia in 1851: This “United States of de-
ported murderers, burglars, ravishers
and pickpockets will furnish the world
with an astonishing example of what a
State of unconcealed blackguards can do
in the way of miracles. They will beat
California hollow.”

Collected Poems. Patrick Kavanagh. Mac-
Gibbon & Kee. 61s.
Part of the fascination of reading a
volume of collected poems is being
able to trace the graph of a writer’s deve-
lopment—from his first pieces through
his growing mastery and maturity to his
decline. The pattern varies with every
poet. With Kavanagh there is develop-
ment and change—but at no point does
he achieve that imperious command of
his matter and medium that shows that
a genuine poet has come into his realm
of power.
In his introduction to his collected
poems Patrick Kavanagh writes, “I have
never been much considered by English
critics.” He doesn’t say how Irish critics
consider him, though he tells us that
once his political verses brought him into
conflict with the police. But it is not
as a political poet that Kavanagh should
be considered —in spite of “The Great
Hunger”, his poem about the “woes of
the poor”. He has three main concerns:
Irish landscape, his family, and literary
bohemia, and it is the last that engages
most of his attention.
His first volume, “Ploughman and
Other Poems” (1936), consists of short
lyrics. “To a Blackbird’’, “Beech Tree”,
“A Star”, “Dreamer”, are representative
titles. Many are bathed in an atmos-
phere of Celtic twilight; others have an
Imagist precision.
In the poems written after this book,
Kavanagh turns more and more to the
life of Irish farmers. His long piece,
“The Great Hunger”, is mainly con-
cerned with asserting that “without the
peasant base civilisation must die,/
Unless the clay is in the mouth the
singer's singing is useless”. To this
early-Torties phase belong the poems
about his Catholic childhood and those
to his father —by far the best in the book.
When he writes about his family his
poems take on a certain fullness of feel-
ing that is not found elsewhere.
More than half the pieces in this col-
lected edition are about the “literary
life”, literary pub-crawls in Dublin and
London—“ Always in pubs I meet them,
the defeated”. Poems about poets who
never came to anything, whose work and
nerve failed them; “A Tale of Two
Cities” ends: “Once again he would re-
turn to Dublin./Where among the
failures he would pass unnoticed,/
Happy in pubs talking about yesterday's
wits,/ And George Moore's use of the
semi-colon”. Other poems mention his
friendship with John Betjeman, meeting
Paul Potts and John Heath-Stubbs.
Scholars and critics come in for many
gibes (“Who Killed James Joyce? A
Harvard Thesis’’). One of his latest
poems, “Sensational Disclosures”, la-
ments his own failure (“He frittered
away/A talent that could flay/D. J. En-
right— say;”). But these poems lack
edge and bite, and are only mildly amus-
ing at their best.
As Kavanagh’s work develops it be-
comes more and more the voice of a
“character”, less and less the voice of a
poet. There are too many poems on
lecturing on poetry, hectoring verses to
himself “Getting Georgian, Richard
Church and Binyon/O stand and plan/
more difficult dominion.” Some of these
pieces, however, deserve a place in
anthologies of light verse.

Dressing for War
A Book of Military Uniforms and Weapons.
Karel Toman. Paul Hamlyn. 525. 6d.
Taking advantage of lower production
costs, this book was designed and printed
in Czechoslovakia for its London pub-
lisher. It is a broad outline of changes
in uniforms, weapons and tactics from
Egyptian times to 1866.
The illustrations in charcoal and color
by the author sacrifice detail for vigor
of execution. They are all a bit like
sketches from some super-film called
“War is Old Fashioned”. They are
nevertheless beautifully done, but when
one is dealing with sixteenth - century
military louts like the Landsknechts one
needs to point up the detail of their dress.
It underlines what many mods and rock-
ers know. Fastidious dress and artfully
styled hair are not incomparable with a
good punch-up.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Growing Labor Pains
Hardly a day goes by without an announcement of
some large new project to be undertaken in Australia,
either by private enterprise or a government body.
Inevitably this will put greater pressure on the already
strained labor resources.
South Australia has given notice of a £2oom. develop-
ment drive involving 20 major projects. The largest of
these is BHP’s lime and sand mining project at Coffin Bay,
which will require 24 miles of railway to Proper Bay, near
Port Lincoln, plus a jetty and new ship-loading facilities.
The new iron ore mining schemes in Western Australia
will demand fresh labor, advertisements for which already
have appeared. Hamersley-Mt Goldsworthy requires 800
men by mid-1965. The sugar cane industry in Queens-
land is attempting to recruit 9000 cane cutters and is asking
for more overseas labor. This has been done previously
and it is obvious that increasing demands will be made for
additional migrant labor.
Commonwealth contracts already let, including the new
£2.75 m. Jindabyne Dam construction as part of the Snowy
Mountains hydro-electric scheme, will create new jobs,
while the industrial plans of various overseas organisations
are also superimposed on the tight labor market.
It is no exaggeration, therefore, to claim that labor de-
mands are likely to be the greatest immediate problem,
thus contributing towards inflated costs. Naturally, the
Government planners are hopeful that the credit restraints
and higher interest rates already imposed throughout the
banking system will damp down any inflationary trends.
Liquidity is becoming tighter all the time and some outside
influences, particularly the rising trend of imports, are at
work to put the squeeze on spending.
With exports easing off and with sales harder to achieve
in the UK belt-tightened area, there should be a reduction
in the flow of funds available for internal spending. With
this thought in mind, perhaps the Commonwealth and State
Governments should consider what effect their own acceler-
ated spending will have on a labor-starved market.
Goldsworthy Pushes Ahead
Western Australian iron ore project of Mount Golds-
worthy Mining Associates and Hamersley Iron Pty
Ltd, which will ship 82 million tons of iron ore to Japan,
already has uncovered the possibility of exporting iron ore
to European steelmakers. This would have been unecono-
mic without the long-term Japanese contracts. Because of
higher freight costs, shipment of iron ore to Europe is
too costly by itself. With the bread and butter establish-
ment costs covered by the Japanese contracts, sales to
Europe may be possible, although on a lower profit ratio.
The first shipment to Japan from Mt Goldsworthy is
scheduled to commence in April. Some 16i million tons
are earmarked for Japan over the next seven years, so the
group will need to push ahead rapidly with its £23m.
development project because of the time limit imposed
by the Government when granting the concession.
Japan is expected to supply certain equipment and rolling
stock under the contract, as is her policy in many of these
export deals throughout the world and as shown in the
supply of coal trucks in Queensland. Equipment will be
required in Western Australia for the 70 miles of railway
from the iron ore deposits to Finucane Island, Port Hed-
land, where a five-mile port entrance must be dredged to
take freighters of up to 60,000 tons.
Once the new port and wharf are established, the flow
of iron ore should add significantly to Australia’s export
proceeds, and doubtless be very welcome in future years
when the pressure for exports will be unceasing.
Attractions of Fertiliser
was talk last week that Continental, the US group
which plans to set up a carbon black plant in Aus-
tralia, may also look at the fertiliser business.
Possibly this sprang from some rumblings in rural
quarters which, interpreted loosely, could mean that there
was dissatisfaction with some “fertiliser rationers” for re-
moving consumer rebates and lifting the price.
The fertiliser .business is booming all over the world. The
plain fact is that, under today’s intensive cultivation pro-
grammes, fertiliser has become a greater necessity. Even
Khrushchev discovered this, to his sorrow, when his agri-
cultural programme sagged for lack of fertiliser.
With fertiliser prices tending to rise and more attention
being paid to nitrogenous fertiliser, there have been plenty
of newcomers sniffing around the precincts of the old-
established suppliers. Farmers and graziers, of course, will
be happy to see some intense competition in this field in the
hope of price cuts.
Loan for Pakistan
steel producers (if they participate) should
be grateful about the latest US 140 million dollar loan
to Pakistan, because 95 million dollars of this 40-year
loan is to buy pig-iron, tinplate, and steel billets, steel
sheets, plate and strip. Interest is only f p.c. for the first
10 years during which no principal payments are required,
then 2 p.c. per annum thereafter.
Pharmaceutical lines, medical equipment, industrial
chemicals, fertilisers, pesticides, etc., are also covered by
the loan. About 15 million dollars will be used to purchase

hcavv-duty, jeep-type trucks and components for trucks

It might not be such a bad idea for Australia to consider
loans of this nature if they can be tied to exports. But just
imagine the howl if BHP received an export contract on
such a basis!
Gold Coast Capers
TI/'hatever’s happening to the rest of Queensland, the
Gold Coast is doing very nicely, thank you. How long
this happy-go-lucky atmosphere can continue may soon
become more problematical under sterner economic
demands.
With the Mount Isa agony still unresolved, it should
certainly feel a little odd to learn that the Coast “is at
present experiencing the most intensive investment period
in its history”. Not without pride the Gold Coast City
Council announces “capital for buildings alone has poured
into this glamorous resort at the rate of £20,000 per day
since July 1, 1964, most of it by sound, recognised business
interests”.
Queensland now must set other more serious building
commitments afoot notably £ll million of Army projects,
a sizeable share of Australia’s new defence programme.
Already qualms about labor pressures and the drag of
boom-like private construction have been expressed.
Perhaps, then, it’s hardly the right time for the Mayor
of the Gold Coast to stress “the most exciting period in
the history of the Gold Coast and emphatic substantiation
of the Gold Coast as a lucrative area for sound investment”.
Nevertheless, he assuredly parades an impressive col-
lection of figures. The 1963-64 year saw buildings valued
in excess of £5 million actually undertaken. During the
last eighteen months approvals went above £9 million,
of which £3,870,000 was approved in the six months ended
December 31, 1964.
The composition of all this effort looks particularly
significant in the light of the rapidly approaching defence
requirements. Included are some 372 single-unit dwellings
commenced in the December half-year. Fresh proposals
for 1965 embrace four multi-storey projects costing more
than £1 million.
Though it may well be true that there can “no longer be
any tongue-in-cheek attitude to the tourist industry on the
Gold Coast”, some interruption might have to slow down
part of such conspicuous consumption.
A Brisbane master builder
has just pointed out the
urgent priorities of Army con-
struction and does not see
how they can be met without
avoiding some civil jobs. In
Queensland, as in other States,
skilled building labor is get-
ting rather short. So much so
that Brisbane builders are
talking of group-tendering in
order to spread labor.
In the long run, too,
Queenslanders might do well
to recall the harsh warnings
contained in “Queensland: In-
dustrial Enigma”, reviewed in
this section a few weeks ago.
There’s a pressing matter of
encouraging manufacturing in
the Brisbane-Moreton area.
"Sorry, Mr Quigley, you're not in the race
now let's be friends."
Not Damn Lies
are, an oft-quoted cynicism tells us, lies, damn
lies and statistics. Or, if a more recent definition given
on page 46 is to be believed, statistics may be branded as
“a device for expressing your political prejudices in con-
vincing scientific guise”.
The Australia and New Zealand Bank, seriously and
rightly, will have none of that. Its latest Quarterly Review
contains a valuable article, “Figures are Facts”, built upon
the rubric that “statistics are the tools of the business
executive, the administrator and social scientist. For figures
are facts facts about numbers and quantities and no
business or community can be managed or governed or
studied without such facts”.
A survey of Australia’s available official coverage brings
out the information that the Commonwealth Bureau of
Census and Statistics issues 557 separate statistical publica-
tions, of which about 100 appear monthly.
The Bank argues, as do many experts, for improvement
in Australia’s statistics and states three definite pre-
requisites. These are: (a) the community must be prepared
to spend more money on statistics; (b) business must show
that it is willing to co-operate by providing full, accurate
and prompt answers to the Statistician’s requests for data;
(c) users must show that they can profitably utilise more,
better and prompter statistics.
After bestowing a justifiable accolade upon the relatively
new National Accounts at Constant Prices, the Bank puts
in a plea for the actual publication of more experimental
and pioneer work, “constructive contributions . . . which
are of value not only for their actual contents but also
because they inspire related work in other quarters.”
This sounds above all like a polite request for an official
index of industrial production, one of Australia’s gravest
statistical lacks. The Bank would certainly receive support
here in Mr George Palmer’s estimable “Guide to Australian
Economic Statistics”, which mentions that the missing index
“has given rise to much criticism . . . particularly by
economists, since most other countries with any pretensions
to possessing a well developed statistical system prepare
industrial production indexes”.
Mr Palmer does furnish some excuse for official
reluctance to publish experimental indexes by referring to
an “Australian propensity to
use even rudimentary index
numbers as solvents for the
most complex problems”.
•The ANZ Bank has, of
course, stepped nobly into
this breach with its own
Index of Factory Production,
though admitting some tech-
nical limitations. Palmer had
to suggest that this index be
treated with considerable re-
serve: “There is no reason
why production in the un-
covered 50 p.c. of manu-
facturing industry should show
the same pattern of change.
The time lag in publication of
about four months also limits
the usefulness of the index.”

Guide to Economic Jargon
An alphabetical life-line for the perplexed
HThe object of this column has been to
A keep Bulletin readers abreast of
Australian economic events and think-
ing. In the past it has been as guilty
as most economics columns of the free
use of jargon. Sometimes this will have
confused a lot of people not up in eco-
nomic twaddle. What we really needed
was a sort of everyman’s guide to the
patois. We now submit one which is
not calculated to help readers on their
way through the column in 1965.
The only excuse for following the
hackneyed words and phrases of con-
temporary writers on the subject is that
they are used the world over, at any
rate in Britain, as the following every-
man's guide prepared by Mr Ralph
Harris, director of the Institute of Eco-
nomic Affairs in that country, illustrates.
It was sent out to wish the friends of the
Institute seasonal greetings in a “slightly
revised edition” of the usual guide.
With the present confused state of eco-
nomic matters in Britain, the author was
at pains to explain that it did indeed
come from the Institute and not from
the newly created Department of Eco-
nomic Affairs. The “Investors’ Chro-
nicle” thought this was a pity. It would
have loved to have attributed the
authorship to the “distinguished” Mini-
ster, Mr George Brown.

The difference between modern Australian and American o££ices
Water Coolers!
American management has found that,
workers feel better, work better and
have higher morale when they replenish
body fluids with cool drinking water.
These are facts often stated by medical
authorities.
If you have an eye for increased em-
ployee efficiency and better employee
morale, it is to your benefit to instal a
water cooler or water coolers.
Investigate Temprite water coolers
first. There are 5 good reasons:
1. Temprite water coolers can be bought
(or rented, if you do not wish to make a
capital investment).
2. Temprite water coolers can serve from
10 to 220 employees efficiently, effect-
ively and economically.
3. There are Temprite coolers designed
for every office and plant . . . small or
large. Some models take only 1 square
foot of space. Every model can be
placed near the work area.
4. There is a five year warranty on each
Temprite.
5. Temprite is manufactured in Australia
by Kelvinator, a national name in indus-
trial refrigeration.

Retreat of Spec. Builders
Estate developers are taking over
ITPhe palmy days of the small speculative
builder are drawing rapidly to a
close. Squeezed none too gently by the
iron fist of the November, 1960, “little
Budget”, the builder who erects a single
house hoping to sell it quickly is dis-
appearing from the scene.
During the credit squeeze, when
money was almost impossible to secure
for building, the pattern of home build-
ing throughout Australia changed mark-
edly. It was during this period that bank-
ruptcy lists were littered with builders
and when many building projects ground
to a halt. Some have only just recovered,
but, unlike the pre-1960 days, a high
degree of caution has entered the game.
With the Federal Government's £250
housing subsidy and the promise of a
housing loan insurance corporation just
around the corner, building in Australia
is assuming more rationality and at pre-
sent stands at record levels.
The activities of the spec, builder have
now been taken over by the big develop-
ers. Whereas the spec, builder erected
usually only one house at a time, the
developers now buy up whole subdivi-
sions and build small “communities”.
Such development is more readily sale-
able than the “one-off”. It’s a common-
place Sunday entertainment nowadays
to drive out to somebody's “Park” or
“Estate” to see what’s new in homes.
Most of the smaller builders The
Bulletin spoke to said profits in build-
ing were slim. They are hamstrung by
delays in the availability of materials
(which means committed capital), sloppy
workmanship (“I've got to go back my-
self and do the job again,” said one) and
highly discriminating buyers who, quite
naturally, want a great deal of value for
their money.
A leading Sydney builder said the in-
dustry has “changed dramatically over
the last thirty years. Today the builder
does not need to employ as much capital
as he did pre-war. Credit before the war
was much smaller and the builder had
hundreds of men on his payroll. Now he
sub-contracts, thus making more finance
available for his activities.
“The whole of the building industry
is tied up in credit. The pity of it is that
so many people with insufficient finance
are still engaged in the game. But for-
tunately the industry has grown so much
that the spec, builder as a whole is be-
coming less and less a part of it. Under-
takings are becoming bigger because of
competition, and, as one result of this,
a lot of smaller people have been pushed
out because it is just not worthwhile to
stay in.
“It's like a game of poker. If you have
the chips you stay in; if you don’t you’re
a fool to borrow, so you get out.
“One of the basic troubles besetting
the industry is that Government depart-
ments do not have a set of standards for
builders to follow. They have no rules
governing the building/capital ratio. This
means that a builder with only a small
amount of capital can tender for the
largest job and still get it. I feel there
should be some relationship between the
builder's capital and the value of the
building for which he tenders.
“The question of financial competence
comes into it too. The general conditions
of contracting are payments on a
monthly basis. The question the industry
has to ask itself is, if the builder is being
paid monthly and he is only paying his
sub-contractors and suppliers on 60-90
day terms, where are the extra funds
going?
“Are these funds being expended to
allow the builder to contract a greater
volume of work than he really has the
financial capacity for or are they being
dissipated in other avenues? This is the
thing that sub-contractors and suppliers
have to realise. If the funds are being
used for purposes other than to pay for
services and supplies, it is a pretty
dangerous situation for all concerned.
“To this extent some suppliers are
backing the builders. They say as long
as I can get my money I’m happy, even
if he doesn’t pay within 60 or 90 days.
And while there is this imbalance be-
tween the builder’s payments and his re-
imbursement of sub-contractors and sup-
pliers, there will always be a great
number of works in progress. This leaves
the way open for people to be confused
about the value of these works.
“As soon as the volume of works
comes down the chickens will come
home to roost.”
Another builder, while also decrying
the lack of financial competence, said
the problem of technical incompetence
was as great, if not greater. “Anybody
can set himself up as a builder,” he said.
“He buys a block of land, sub-contracts
the foundations, the bricklaying, tiling,

and doors close properly because so
much craftsmanship has left the industry.
“They’ve realised they can make more
money working for themselves than they
can working for a boss. If they’re con-
tracted to do a job, they do it in the
quickest possible time so they can get on
with another one. In many of the build-
ing trades, too, people are just not being
trained the right way. In some not
enough are being trained.”
In Melbourne the building picture is
pretty much the same. Here again the
industry is becoming more and more
based on large responsible firms.
An executive of one Melbourne-based
construction company (which does not
involve itself with speculative building
because of the risk involved) said “the
day of the small-time spec, man is rapidly
drawing to a close. The estate developers
have taken over a lot of the business,
especially since the credit squeeze forced
most of the little blokes out. Although
the estate boys do not have the majority
of the market as yet, it will not be very
long before they do.
“Most of the spec, building is done
without builders,” he continued. “A real
estate agent or maybe groups with some
cash under their belt buy a block of land
and have the shell erected. Then they
call in a carpenter, then a tiler for the
roof, then a bricklayer. With all this
sub-contracting, no one cares much about
the quality of his work and the agent is
always seeking to get the job done in the
quickest possible time at the cheapest
possible rates.”
“There are very few one or two man
shows,” said a spokesman from another
company. “The capital requirements are
too big today, with the provisions under
law for roads and drainage, etc., before
a block of land can be improved. An-
other problem is that every home must
be complete before a customer can get
bank finance for it. No longer can the
spec, builder build a home to the lock-
up stage only. This, of course, means that
more capital is required.”
Developing this point further, another
builder pointed out that the spec, builder
today had lost his one-time advantage of
being able to present a potential custo-
mer with the finished product. “The
‘order’ builders have overcome the prob-
lem ot only being able to show a client
a set of plans by introducing display
homes. Under the contract, a buyer must
get a house exactly the same as the dis-
play one so. like a spec.-built home, he
can see precisely what he will be getting.
More important still is the customer’s be-
lief that the ‘order’ home has not been
as subject to sloppy sub-contracting.”
It was generally agreed that this fac-
tor, combined with intense competition
and the credit squeeze, had brought
about severe falls in the percentage of
spec, homes. “Don’t forget also,” said
a spokesman for one of the listed build-
ers, “that today’s customer is more dis-
criminating than ever. Most of these
jobs are in the £3OOO to £4OOO class and
the daily newspapers all run weekly
columns on houses in this price range,
so you rarely strike a foolish or unwary
buyer. They all seem to know where
the most likely weak spots are and, if
they don’t, then somebody with them
does.”
An estate developer was most empha-
tic that spec, building would be entirely
in the hands of his type of company
before too long, perhaps five years.
“Sure, a few small men will always be
coming and going but never staying.
They haven’t got the capital, the adver-
tising ability, the salesmen or the back-
ing to stay even remotely important.
And, what’s more, they never attract and
keep customer interest with one house
going up here and there, instead of
dozens of them on a brand new estate
surrounded by parklands, often new
shopping centres and often other facili-
ties.”

Not Quite So Sweet
Haughtons reservations on sugar
npHE present world sugar price of around
A £stg24 a ton (which is below most
average production costs) does not give
heart to the sugar industry. After CSR,
another of the Australian companies to
forecast the effect of the low price is
Haughton Sugar of Queensland, which,
on a revised estimate, says lower profits
for 1964-65 can be expected.
Directors say the price will be sub-
stantially less than anticipated. Fore-
casts of profit for the current year will
have to be revised when the final price
of sugar is known. Another damper is
higher milling costs, mainly due to in-
creased wages.
In the 1964 season the company pro-
duced 39,209 tons of sugar from the
282,568 tons of cane treated. This
compares favorably with the previous
season's figure of 36,556 tons from
241,535 tons of cane. Both the latest
season's figures were records, though
falling short of the 43,200 tons expected
from an estimated 297,000 tons of cane
available.
Results were adversely affected by
abnormal seasonal conditions, about
15,000 tons of cane being left unhar-
vested due to cyclonic rains near the
end of the harvesting season, and the
lower recovery of sugar from juices
extracted from the cane than in past
seasons. Directors expect the crop
available for crushing in the 1965 sea-
son to be about 500,000 tons. Expan-
sion of crushing facilities, necessary to
handle the increase, is proceeding satis-
factorily and at costs in line with esti-
mates.
In the light of uncertain prices and
the impossibility of weighing them
against increased sugar cane crushing,
the directors “remain guardedly confi-
dent that future results will continue to
be satisfactory". Intending investors
should also be cautious. Present price
for the 10s. shares is around 275.
Rapid Robert
"Oobert Hutchinson Ltd, operating
unit for the listed holding company,
upheld its reputation for prompt report-
ing by announcing results for the half-
year to December 31 on January 4 last
week—four days after the close of the
year. And, as usual, full details of pro-
fits, sales, tax and depreciation were sup-
plied. Shareholders could hardly wish
for more.
Operating as a flourmiller, stock feed
miller and merchant, the half-year’s pro-
fit was lifted from £44,000 to £54.000.
Last year’s full result was some £94,000,
so if trends are maintained 1964-65
should produce a figure around the
£llO,OOO mark. This would provide a
decent sort of boost to the earning rate,
which is already healthy at more than
21 p.c. on ordinary capital, or 13 p.c. if
one chooses to include the deferred
shares which will rank for dividends at
the end of 1965-66.
Sales of £4.0 million compare with
£6.9 million in the full 1963-64 year to
provide further evidence that the trend
is most definitely up. Directors expect
that the parent company will be declar-
ing a steady interim dividend of 5 p.c.,
indicating that last year’s 10 p.c. rate is
to be continued.
If it was not for the deferred shares,
all signs would point to a dividend lift
or perhaps even a share issue in the 1965
calendar year. Still, the mere fact that
trading is going so well may turn direc-
tors’ thoughts in these directions despite

the higher commitments due in a year
and a half. Expansion undertaken so
far will ensure that new records will
continue to be set for some time yet.
Recently completed or still under erec-
tion are a wheat conditioning plant at
Glenroy (Vic.), a bulk handling plant
for meat meal and grain at the same
site,, and four wheat storage bins to hold
100,000 bushels at the Gunnedah flour
mills.
Fertile Leaves
will undoubtedly be more moves
similar to the recent one of the CRA
group before 1965 is heralded out. A
new subsidiary, Greenleaf Fertilisers,
has been formed to take over the group’s
fertiliser operations at Cockle Creek in
NSW. The large expansion undertaken
by the companies in this industry al-
ready, and that still to come, means that
many more organisations will see the
value, if they haven’t already, in bring-
ing this sector of their activities under
one management or controlling body.
Formerly, Sulphide Corporation (75
p.c. CRA and 25 p.c. New BH) ran the
50-year-old -jCockle Creek business.
Greenleaf will actually be a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Sulphide and, therefore,
only a sub-subsidiary to the CRA parent
itself.
The new company is the forerunner
of the already announced plans to spend
£5 million on the building of acid and
fertiliser works, which will turn out a
complete range of phosphate fertilisers.
Full production will be achieved by the
end of 1966 when, combined with the
existing facilities, Greenleaf’s capacity
will be in the vicinity of one million
tons annually.
Woeful Wenzel
Tt is to be hoped that 1963-64 re-
organisation will bring a halt to the
downhill slide of Wenzel, Batty and
McGrath in the current year. The com-
pany operates in the troubled textile
trade as a woollen and trimming merch-
ant, the result of a merger which took
place nearly five years ago. Last week
it reported a £74,000 loss for the year
to October 31—the second loss since the
merger, the first being some £28,000 in
the previous year.
Directors attributed the loss to the
elimination of outmoded and surplus
stocks and commitments. They said
overheads had now been reduced and
margins increased to the level where
profits could be earned. Shareholders
will not be setting much store by this,
however, as they were told a similar
story in the interim report a few months
ago. At that time, the directors said a
loss had been incurred in the six months
to April 30 but profits were expected in
the latter half.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
Favorable Takeover by Repco
Economics of the Auto. Components deal
Tt now seems that Repco Ltd will
succeed with its revised bid for Auto-
motive Components Limited and the
identity of the other potential offerers
will not be made known to the share-
holders. Certainly the record of Repco
over the last five years suggests that it
will be able to instil some dynamism into
the ACL group, improving the overall
profitability to the benefit of the accept-
ing shareholders.
The unknown factor is the extent to
which the profits of the ACL group will
benefit now that the competition from
Repco will presumably be reduced. How-
ever, this may not occur, because it has
been stated that “. . . the boards of both
companies had agreed to maintain the
separate identity of Automotive Com-
ponents.” It could well mean that the
two groups will continue to compete
against each other for orders from the
automotive manufacturers. Perhaps it
can be assumed that there will be a
“floor price”, so that quotes will not be
so fine that there is not a reasonable profit
in the contract.
At this point of time, it would seem
that the main benefits will arise from
the provision of management at board
level, since for a while after the annual
meeting at the end of October the com-
pany had only two directors, one of
whom was a Sydney chartered accountant
who presumably could not devote all his
time to the affairs of ACL. The position
was improved when Mr W. W. Buck was
reappointed to the board after an
interval of about five years.
With the raising of an additional
£300.000 in unsecured notes and an-
other £150.000 on a secured basis, it
would seem that some considerable pro-
gress had been made in the reorganisa-
tion of the group's outside borrowings.
From this base, it is quite likely that
ACL would not have been pressed
financially for a few years. Of the
£1,234,000 approximately of liabilities
due within the five years to June 30,
1969, it would seem that £951,000
approximately would be the normal credit
received in the course of business.
All this suggests that, despite the
apparent poor result disclosed in 1963-
64, Automotive Components was by no
means in difficulties. There was every
prospect that it was in a position to take
advantage of the increased business that
could be expected from the increase in
the local content of vehicles currently
being assembled in Australia. The
greatest benefits from the increase in
local content would most likely accrue
to the manufacturers of engine parts, as
a number of quite popular vehicles
currently use fully imported engines.
Automotive Components is particularly
strong in this area and it is understood
that Perfect Circle rings are highly re-
garded.
It may be helpful to look at the results
of the two companies over the period
from July 1, 1959, to June 30, 1963, so
far as per share earnings and dividends
are concerned. In each case the 1959-60
figure has been used as a base = 100.
PER SHARE EARNINGS
1960 1961 1962 1963
Auto. Components 100 75 90 112
Repco 100 97 98 122
PER SHARE DIVIDENDS
Auto. Components 100 54 86 107
Repco 100 102 123 158
These figures show that Repco has had
much greater growth, particularly in
dividends, and also its results have not
had such wide fluctuations. The 1963-64
figures have not been included in view of
the problems associated with the non-
recurring items listed in Auto. Com-
ponents annual report but the 1962-63
earnings per share have been adjusted
downwards to allow for the “error in
1963 stock valuation”.
By almost any standard, Repco seems
to have been earning at a higher rate
than Auto. Components. Whichever ratio
is used—earnings p.c. ordinary capital,
earnings p.c. shareholders’ funds or pre-
tax profit p.c. capital employed—Repco’s
rate of return is significantly higher. So
far as the first-named ratio is concerned,
the rate is nearly double; in the case of
the other two, the rate is nearly 50 p.c.
greater. This leads us to making some
guess at the earnings that Repco will have
to obtain from Auto. Components if its
current earning rate on ordinary capital
is not to be reduced. The process involves
making some guess as to the earning rate
on Repco’s ordinary capital after the new
issue. I have assumed that the rate will
be about 26 p.c. on the basis of the rate
that was being achieved in 1963-64 on
funds employed.
To achieve this rate on the capital
that will be issued for Auto. Components
(assuming that the cash portion is equal
to Repco’s shares ex issue at, say

225. 6d.), earnings will only need to
reach £120,000. Auto. Components
earned slightly more than this figure in
1961-62 and 38 p.c. more in 1962-63.
It also seems that, if the non-recurring
items are ignored, earnings would have
been in excess of £120,000 in 1963-64.
It would appear that Repco has made
a good purchase at a keen price in Auto.
Components and there is every reason
to believe that the capital to be issued
will more than earn its keep. Repco itself
is currently about to raise substantial
funds to expand manufacturing facilities;
it may well be that some of these
additional facilities will no longer be
needed in the short term.
Judging by the last balance sheet, the
rights issue to shareholders, which will
open on January 11, 1965, will be
needed to reduce loans at call, which
jumped from just under £198,000 at
June 30, 1963, to nearly £1,390,000 at
June 30, 1964. Bank overdraft also
increased from £935,624 to £1,252,794,
but this figure, although one-third greater
than the preceding year, does not seem
out of line with normal trading.
In any event, it seems likely that the
combined shareholders’ funds of Repco-
Auto. Components would be not less than
£19.5 million and as at June 30 last the
combined external liabilities did not
exceed £ll million. This would suggest
that (assuming Auto. Components is
acquired) Repco would be able to borrow
at least another £8.5 million. Further-
more, the present cover for the total
interest charge would be nearly four and
one half times, thus making any borrow-
ings well secured both as to assets and
as to income.
At current prices of 255. 3d., cum the
new issue, the shares look attractive with
a 3 p.c. immediate dividend yield. The
prospects of some weakening in the price
during the course of the rights trading
can only be guessed at.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Facing an Eventful Year
A good shorting situation to begin
VI/'ell, here we are in 1965. It could
almost be a year that is too event-
ful. Soekarno’s up there breathing hot
fire and he doesn't worry much where
it’s directed. Perhaps we could tem-
porarily pacify him by sending up a
batch of beautiful Bondi bikinis.
The Indonesian situation must, make
some impact on our market. There are
a multitude of other things hanging over
it, too. Next month, the basic wage
review comes up in the Arbitration Court.
Then, in August, Mr Holt will become
unpopular again when he introduces a
deflationary Budget. On top of this, Aus-
tralia’s trade position is not being helped
by the fall in prices of most of our major
exports. Wool prices are down 10 p.c.
on last year. Metal prices have suddenly
changed direction and are well down
over the last month. The world sugar
price has slipped further back to £stg2s
per ton.
All this paints a dismal picture for the
stock market. No wonder that my atten-
tion turned towards good shorting situa-
tions. CSR was the one I finally selected.
Over the last few months the shares had
drifted down to the low 70s. The interim
report in December, warning of lower
profits, sparked off a sudden fall to*
655. 6d. Then, behaving in the normal
pattern, the price recovered to 71s. By
the time I shorted 200 at 70s. 6d., they
were on their way down again.
By taking a risk I’m trying to make
money out of CSR. Unlike a friend of
mine who purchased 150 RMC shares
last year. In due course he filled in the
transfer and requested cash. This he
subsequently received in full. Then
started an almost daily batch of cor-
respondence from the CSR company re-
questing him to sign further forms. The
letters started to take on a threatening
tone, so what else could he do but sign
the forms. So now he’s the proud owner
of an odd lot of both CSR shares and
Blue Metal shares, for nothing!
It would almost seem 1 was gunning
for CSR when I took out a put option
on United Telecasters. For reasons be-
yond me these shares had recovered from
9s. to 11s. It’s almost as if everyone was
determined to forget the 1963-64 result.
An establishment year for any com-
pany is always a difficult time. But the
directors can hardly be forgiven when
they discovered that capital costs were
50 p.c. greater than budgeted. In the
prospectus, directors proposed to use
£300,000 borrowed funds in addition to
the £1,500,000 capital. Now the expected
borrowings will not be much less than
£1,000,000. How many companies have
we seen bogged down with excessive
borrowed funds?
The market must recognise this short-
coming sooner or later. If it’s going to
be later I'll still benefit by the 6 months
put option I’ve taken out. At 11s. the
cost was Is. 3d., or £62 on the 1000
shares.
Early in the diary I mentioned that
metal prices had slumped. That com-
bined lead-zinc price of £284 I was talk-
ing about a few weeks ago is down by
£5O to £234. Thus it was that I decided
to sell the 75 New Broken Hill shares
at 1235. The other sale for the week was
the 500 Automotive Components at Bs.
Now that an offer by Repco acceptable
to directors has been made, there does
not seem to be much point holding them.
Both these sales resulted in a loss of
a few' pounds.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
200 CSR, 70/6 £695
75 New Broken Hill, 123/- .... £456
500 Auto. Components, 8/- .... £194
PUT OPTION
1000 United Telecasters (11/-), 1/3 £62

THE MAN ON THE LAND
Italy and the Wool Reserve
A major customer seeks more stable prices
From DESMOND O’GRADY in Rome
PFhe proposed wool reserve price
scheme would not help Australia sell
more wool in the opinion of experienced
members of the Italian textile industry.
Their opinion deserves attention, for
only Japan and England buy more of
Australia’s wool than Italy.
The Italian argument is that a stable
price, rather than a reserve price, would
be the best way to protect wool against
the challenge of synthetics. Wool com-
mands a diminishing proportion of the
expanding world market for textiles and
the textile industry’s expectations are in-
creasingly shaped by synthetics. Whereas,
in the pre-war period, textile industry
fortunes were often made through specu-
lation on wool prices, the post-war has
witnessed a conversion to synthetics,
whose stable prices allow minor but
steadier profits, relate success to manage-
ment efficiency and lead to improved
products.
The changeover has accompanied an
expansion of the Italian textile industry
to meet the growing world demand. This
expansion has seen companies convert
from family affairs to public concerns
whose shareholders want to be assured
of a steady return on their investments.
Directors of the textile companies com-
plain that they cannot inform share-
holders whether they will make a 10 p.c.
gain or a 50 p.c. loss because the price
of wool fluctuates. “I want to run a tex-
tile business, not a bookmaking
business,” said the director of one of
Italy’s larger textile factories after
lamenting the instability of wool prices.
Smaller firms are satisfied with the
present fluctuating wool prices as there is
always the possibility that these will
drop, to the small firms’ profit, after
bigger companies have left the market.
The present market system helps them to
undercut the bigger firms, thus encourag-
ing these major producers to depend even
more on stable-priced synthetics.
The bigger and medium-sized textilers
sell to clothing manufacturers at a fixed
price up to a year before clothes appear
on the market. The textiler has the assur-
ance that the price of synthetics will not
vary for two or three years. Wool prices
can alter dramatically to destroy his anti-
cipated profit.
Continuance of the present system will
ensure that synthetics occupy an ever-
increasing proportion of the expanding
middle and lower zones of the textile
market. The success of synthetics in the
fashion field has shown that they are also
capable of making inroads in the quality
market.
The men whose offices in the Hudders-
field of Italy, Biella, are lined with maps
showing Australian pastoral stations, and
the men in Roman textile factories who
follow daily the movement of prices at
the Australian wool sales, should be con-
sidered in any wool marketing scheme be-
cause their choice between wool and
synthetics, like that of textilers of other
nations, will have direct repercussions on
the Australian economy.
What is the Italian suggestion? It is
that standard prices for the different
grades of wool, with the exception of
superfines, be set by a government-spon-
sored authority for a year at a time, or
for longer periods if possible. It cannot
be too strongly stressed that they want
stability, not cheapness. It is a gross
mistake to think that there is a pre-
ference for synthetics because they are
cheaper than wool. In the high-fashion
field synthetic garments are often more
expensive than woollen ones. The advan-
tage of synthetics is that their stable
prices allow a predictable profit margin.
Italian textile manufacturers have no
doubt that wool is the best fibre; their
doubt is whether they can afford to con-
tinue to work it when they are sabotaged
by a crazy marketing system. If 20,000

1964. Would LESLIE FRANCES DELANPIERE,

MAN & WILSON, 422 Little Collins Street,
Melbourne, Victoria. 67 8621.
cardigans are ordered from a textile fac-
tory, the director quotes a price which
allows a certain profit margin. He is
sure of the price if he uses synthetics,
whereas he might find, if he buys wool,
that its price fluctuation forces him to
produce the cardigans at a loss.
It is worth repeating, for the benefit
of those woolmen whose wooliness
makes them the synthetic manufacturers’
best friends, that stable prices are essen-
tial, not low prices. More wool would
not be sold if its price was lowered by
20 p.c., so long as it kept fluctuating
by 10-15 p.c. More sales would result,
however, if prices were set at even 10 p.c.
above the present levels. As the cost of
raw wool is only 10 p.c. of the retail
price of an average ready-made suit, an
increase of 10 p.c. in wool prices would
mean only a 1 p.c. increase in the retail
price of the suit. The increase could be
absorbed by the greater efficiency pos-
sible when raw material costs are stable.
At the moment the uncertainty of the
market is acute and Italian textilers are
furious about it. Approximately three
months ago the market fell by 10 p.c.
and then stayed stable for a month. The
Italians bought on the calculation that
the market would either remain steady
for another six months or, if anything,
rise when the Japanese or Russians
entered. They held off, and the market
has dropped still further.
The Italians interpret this as a sign of
the textile industry's lack of confidence in
the efficacy of the costly promotion cam-
paign for pure virgin wool. Certainly it
has reduced their confidence in the cam-
paign. As the campaign’s effects are to
be felt in September, 1965, textilers who
work nine months ahead should be buy-
ing for it now. Instead of that they are
anxiously eyeing the market. The com-
parison with synthetics is, as usual, to
the disadvantage of wool. A publicity
campaign for a synthetics product is fol-
lowed by increased production without
speculation on the price of the fibre.
Promotion has a direct relation to pro-
duction, whereas with wool it is a casual
relationship because of an unreliable
marketing method.
Wool marketing methods are already
destroying the confidence of textilers and
the reserve price scheme will ensure that
it loses the collaboration of still more
of them. It is not merely irrelevant to the
major problem of selling more woo!—it
can also damage the industry as it will
tend to augment price fluctuations.
Buyers will hold off until the price nears
the reserve; then bid competitively, send-
ing it soaring, only to pull out if it goes
too high; it will then drop again to near
the reserve. Price graphs will look like
scenic railways, which should comfort
nobody but the manufacturers of syn-
thetic fibres.
Factory-Farms on the Way
Well beyond the experimental stage
npHE scene is a valley, the grass is lush
and green, there is evidence on every
hand of careful and thorough pasture
improvement. But there are no animals
in sight.
On the edge of the valley there is a
shed, built from timber which has been
carefully and thoroughly treated with
preservatives. It is shiny and solidly con-
structed. There are no windows.
From inside come the sounds of muf-
fled bellowings and the clank of chains.
The strong odour of animal sweat per-
meates the air, together with the sickly-
sweet smell of stacked hay. It is not a
concentration camp.
It is a modern factory-farm one of
a number which have gone up in the last
year or so, mainly as experiments. These
are patterned on the British factory-
farms, which are well beyond the experi-
mental stage and are considered, by
many experts, to be the best thing that
ever happened to farming.
An attendant, clad in an antiseptic-
looking white coat, unlocks the shed and
bids us enter. Inside it is gloomy. You
have to duck to miss striking your head
on the hay stacked overhead on wire
trays. “It’s for insulation,” explains the
attendant. “It ' keeps the temperature
even.”
On both sides of the shed are pens
and in each pen there is a calf. It is
chained fore and aft. It can lie down or
stand up. But that’s all. It eats at one
end and the food is provided from an
ingenious conveyor belt. It excretes from
the other end and this matter is taken
away by an equally ingenious conveyor
device.
Never will these calves know the joy
of gambolling in the lush, green pasture
outside their confine. They do not utilise
it efficiently enough that way. It is cut,
crimped, rolled and otherwise treated
with supplements, and fed to them where
they stand.
Farming technology dictates that this
is the method by which they will be
reared for slaughter and in technology
there is no room for sentimentality. Is
this too bleak a picture of factory-farm-
ing?
Maybe it is. But it should at least be
given some thought by anyone contem-
plating such methods. The calves may be
pigs or poultry. It does not matter much.
It is the principle we are looking at here.
In Australia, because we are lucky
enough to have large expanses of grass-
land, the factory-farms will not intrude
on the scene to anything like the extent
they have in Britain and other European
countries. But poultry, for example, are
being reared in ever-increasing numbers
on the cage system. Before long, anyone
free-ranging poultry will be considered
archaic.
Pigs and calves, and possibly even fat
lambs, will go into sheds if it looks like
paying. All that is needed is a premium
price for such scientifically fattened ani-
mals. If the premium is good enough the
present experiments will become fully
operative factory-farms.
One of the largest contract-price
poultry concerns in Australia has em-
barked on a new policy. The policy is
this: people coming into the business (of
running poultry farms using the battery-
cage system) will be preferably people
with no previous experience of poultry
farming. A member of the firm told this
writer: “We find newcomers better. They
do things the way we tell them. Get some
bloke who is used to fowls and he reckons
he knows how to do it better than we do.
Besides, he feels sorry for them and
that’s no good in our business.”
It makes one think.

depending on the required degree of diffusion and light intensity, there are
special grades of ‘Perspex’ which give maximum performance.
Add to this, the fact that ‘Perspex’ allows complete freedom of design, that it’
lighter, stronger and safer than glass, and you have some pretty good reasons
why 1.C.1. ‘Perspex’ acrylic sheet is today’s outstanding product for lighting.
