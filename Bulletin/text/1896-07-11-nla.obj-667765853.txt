Saturday Review’s notice of Saintsbary’s
4 ‘Nineteenth Century Literature ” is a crushing
impeachment. The new Edinburgh professor is
oonvicted of scores of blunders in his dates, of the
familiar slovenliness in his style, and of a rudimen-
tary ignorance in which mention of “Ueber alien
Gipfeln ist Rub ” as “ Goethe’s famous axiom ” is
a minor feature. Even the character and difficulty
of Suintsbury’s work do not explain or excuse his
remarkable lapses.
* * * *
In respect of Henley and Henderson’s new
edition of Burns, it is interesting to note with
what unanimity the first-volume copies on the
booksellers’ tables onen at the Epistle to John
R ankine, telling how the poet was fined because
he straikit a pretty little hen. The responsibility*
of course, lies entirely with the booksellers them-
selves. Homines sunt, nihil humanum, &e.
* * * *
Louise Mack (Mrs. J. P. Creed) has three
other volumes in the hands of Fisher Unwin,
awaiting publication. Two reprint her short
stories—mostly from The Bulletin ; the third,
“ God’s Girl,” contains a new and longer tale.
* * * •
English Saturday Review has a just re-
mark on Becke : —“The stories, as a whole, leave
less the impression of works of art than of simple
and uncolored sketches and reminiscences of life
among the islanders of the Pacific—sketches in
which the writer sets down what he has seen and
heard without, as a rule, doing much to subject
his materials to the shaping spirit of imagination.”
The point isn’t settled yet; but probably, how-
ever far afield in romance he may go, Becke will
find, in comparison with the paradise of brown
women and white men of which he has been
.created master,, no paradise worth Adam.”
» * * *
Becke and Jeffery’s second romance, “ The
Mutineers,” has been sold to Angus and
Robertson, of Sydney, who think highly of its
interest and literary quality. It .may be some
time before the book is published, and it is first
held for serial use.
* * * *
selection from Alex. Montgomery’s Bul-
letin tales is shortly to appear in Geo. Robertson
and Co’s “ Warrigal ” series. For the same series
are secured collections of short stories by Ernest
Favenc, Roderic Quinn, and Patrick Quinn —in-
cluding several from The Bulletin.
* * * *
Writes H. : “ Becky’s ‘Democracy,’ at
somewhere about ill per Hi., is for the conversion
of the Socialists. No poor man sees it, or bothers
about it. The rioli buy it, and say ‘ Aii, this will
do a lot.of good, you know!’ Mere intellectual
catchpenny, to tickle their intellectual tobies.”
But this is shallow. Lecky isn’t a rich man :he
wants all the money his books can earn him. And
then his book is unfit to be directly assimilated by
the multitude ; the capacity to think on the philo-
sophic plane is rare. None the less, what of
value it has is sure to reach the multitude. Com-
pare Darwin and Sp meer. Two or three sections
of Spencer’s works have been published at “ popu-
lar prices ”; but the bulk of bis philosophy
is inaccessible to ordinary purses. Darwin’s
characteristic books have never been below a pro-
hibitive 7s. 6d. Yet the thought of Darwin and
Spencer permeates everywhere. Thinkers such
as they have at command a troop of disciples—
compilers, politicians, journalists—whose office ii
is to dilute their thought, to sweeten it with
rhetoric, to give it local application and make it
intelligible with local images. H.’s complaint is
unreasonable. It is sufficient for any man to be
teacher, originator, creator : of expounders and
commentors ad vulgus there is already an army.
* • * *
It was the printer who turned “com-
mentators” into “commentors” above, just as
the mining reporter changed “amalgamate” to
amalgate ” the other day. Let the new words
stand : they are shorter and sensibler.
* * * *
The Dopper Boer has bobbed up frequently
of late. It is worth while explaining that he
comes from “ Dop,” which'is the German “ Topf,’
a pot or bowl, applied to his extreme Calvinistic
sect because its hair is, or was, worn as if the old
Mother Dopper had put a bowl on its head and
given it the familiar basin-crop. So a Dopper is
really a Roundhead.
* * * »
The culture-standard of M.L. Parliament
is only moderate, so it seems strange that the best-
read book in the Parliamentary Library is a
French one. But the volume’s joyous peculiarity
is to contain a number of passages so “darkly,
deeply, beautifully blue,” even for France, that in
order to avoid governmental suppression they had
to be printed in a foreign language, and the bene-
volent compilers chose English ! And this is how
the hair comes out of M.L. Parliamentary cocoa-
nuts.
* * * *
In her recently-published “Memoirs” of
stage-life Mary Anderson complains of the
evil effects of long runs.
Prominent among them is a general mental
weariness which often causes one to forget the
most familiar lines, and turn blankly to the
prompter’s box or to some friendly actor for the
words. This happened to me several times, not-
ably in “ The Winter’s Tale,” in London, where,
after playing it a hundred nights, I had to be
prompted in several of Bermione’s great speeches.
Edwin Booth, during the long run of “Hamlet”
at his own theatre, frequently called for the lines.
An actor who was in his company told me
that Booth turned to him one night, and with a
look of consternation, asked what he was to say
next. His mind for the moment had become a
blank. The actor gave him the word. Booth
began the speech, faltered again, was prompted a
second time, but finding it impossible to continue,
called out in a loud voice, “Ring down the cur-
tain.” Many other examples might be cited to
show how weary the brain grows after acting the
same part six or seven times weekly for one or
two hundred consecutive nights, with only the
rest of Sunday to distract the mind.

London Times summarises Lady Burton ;
Lady Burton, widow of Captain Sir R. F. Bur-
ton, the famous traveller, died March 22. She
was a daughter of Mr. H. R. Arundell, of Wardour.
She was a cousin of Cardinal Vaughan’s, and
until her marriage belonged entirely to the old
English Catholic world. She married Richard
Burton in 1861, and there is probably no record
of a more devoted wife; yet she never sank her
individuality in that of her husband. Soon after
their marriage they lost almost all they possessed,
rare Arabic and Persian MSS., nearly all Burton’s
unpublished poetry, costumes of every nation,
together with invaluable Oriental books, in
the fire which took place at Grindlay’s,
the Army Agent’s. Burton was appointee
Consul at Fernando Po, subsequently in
Brazil, and in 1869 at Damascus, and
his wife often travelled with him dis-
guised as his son. She was a good
shot, an excellent fencer, and a practised swim-
mer. Often she would receive from him a laconic
. note, “ Ordered off ; pay, pack, and follow.” She
was of great assistance to Sir Richard Burton in
his literary work also. His translation of the
“ Thousand and One Nights ” occupied them both
from 1884 to 1888, and brought them 16,000
guineas, of which at his death only eight shillings
remained. During his lifetime Lady Burton
brought out an abridged edition of the “Thousand
and One Nights,” over which she lost a consider-
able sum. Burton left a manuscript translation
of the Persian work entitled “The Scented Gar-
den,” the profits of which he intended should
be a provision for her. She was offered
six thousand guineas for it, but she burnt
it. Her motive appears to have been a
-sincere regard for Burton’s reputation. Lady
Burton erected at Mortlake for her husband’s
body a large marble tomb in the shape of a tent,
which was subscribed for by the nation. Outside
is a large crucifix, and an open book of marble
whereon Burton’s name is inscribed, and inside is
a chapel containing an altar of alabaster and
Burton’s embalmed body in a steel casket. By
his side she left room for her own coffin, and she
took a house at Mortlake in order that she might
spend much time in this mausoleum. In addition
to her life of Sir Richard Burton, Lady Burton
wrote “Inner Life of Syria” (2 vols., Kegan
Paul), and a work on Arabia, Egypt and India,
and in collaboration with her husband, “ Unex-
plored Syria.” , She also edited his “ Lusiad,”
and at the time of her death she was engaged in
bringing out an edition of all lur works. In 1891
Lady Burton received a civil list-pension of .£l5O
a year.

The cable did not tell the death of H. 0.

For the last 17 years he has edited New
York Puck, a magazine of many graces.
Like the men of his tribe and country,

forcible : in “ Short Sixes ” are some quaint

THE WAY TO ARC AD Y.
O, what’s the way to Arcady,
To Arcady, to Arcady ;
Oh, what’s the way to Arcady,
Where all the leaves are merry ?
Oh ! what’s the way to Arcady ?
The spring is rustling in the tree—
The tree the wind is blowing through—
It sets the blossoms flickering white.
I knew not skies could burn so blue,
Nor any breezes blow so light.
Thgy blow an old-time way for me
Across the world of Arcady.
o’n, what’s the way to Arcady ?
Sir Poet, with the rusty coat,
Quit mocking of the song-bird’s note.
How have you heart for any tune,
You with the wayworn russet shoon?
Your scrip, a-swinging by your side,
Gapes with a gaunt mouth hungry-wide.
I’ll brim it well with pieces red,
If you will tell the way to tread.
“ Oh, I am bound for Arcady,
And if you but keep pace with me
You tread the way to Arcady.”
And where away lies Arcady,
And how long yet may the journey be ?
“ Ah, that ” (quoth he) “ I do not know—
Across the clover and the snow—
Across the frost, across the flowers—
Through summer seconds and winter hours.
I’ve trod the way my whole life long,
And know not now where it may be )
My guide is but the stir to song,
That tells me I can not go wrong,
Or clear or dark the pathway be
Upon the road to Arcady.”
But how shall I do who cannot sing?
'T was wont to sing, once on a time—
There is never an echo now to ring
Remembrance back to the trick of rhyme.
“ ’Tis strange you cannot sing ” (quoth he),
“ The folk all sing in Arcady.”
But how may he find Arcady
Who hath nor youth nor melody?
“ What, know you not, old man ” (quoth he)-
“ Your hair is white, your face is wise—
That Love must kiss that mortal’s eyes
Who hopes to'see fair Arcady?
“ No gold can buy you entrance there;
But beggared Love may go all bare—
No wisdom won with weariness ;
But Love goes in with Folly’s dress—
No flame that wit could ever win ;
But only Love may lead Love in
To Arcady, to Arcady.”
Ah, woe is me, through all my days
Wisdom and wealth I both have got,
And fame, and name, and great men’s praise
But Love, ah, Love ! I have it not.
There was a time, when life was new—
But far away, and half forgot—
I only know her eyes were blue ;
But Love—l fear I knew it not.
We did not wed, for lack of gold,
And she is dead, and I am old.
All things have come since then to me
Save Love, ah, Love ! and Arcady.
“ Ah, then I fear we part” (quoth he),
“ My way’s for Love and Arcady.”
But you, you fare alone, like me;
The grey .is likewise in your hair.
And love have you to lead you there,
To Arcady, to Arcady?
“ Alt, not lonely do I fare;
My true companion’s Memory.
With Love he fills the Spring-time air ;
With Love he clothes the Winter tree.
Oh, past this poor horizon’s bound
My song goes straight to one who stands—
Her face all gladdening at the sound —
To lead me to the Spring-green lands,
To wander with enlacing hands.
The songs within my breast that stir
Are all of her, are all of her.
My maid is dead long years ” (quoth he),
“She waits forme in Arcady.”
Oh, yon’s the way to Arcady,
To Arcady, to Arcady;
Oh, yon’s the way to Arcady,
Where all the leaves are merry.

COUGHS, COLDS ON THE CHEST, BRON-
CHITIS AND ASTHMA RABIDLY
CURED BY Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
chronic. No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
“Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir,—Your in dicine has
cured tne of bronchitis and asthma, from whicli I suffered
for upwards of seven years, during which period-I was
scarcely ever free from coughs, and frequently the diffi-
culty of breathing was so distressing that for nights in
succession I had to sit up. 1 write you this acknowledg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous 1 had been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
violent cough, expectorating blood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, until I became,
as I am now, quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER,
Balmain, Sydney.”
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Gough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the back and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size trot tle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured. —J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Tamworth, N.S.W.”
“ We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne’s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-
fectly and rapidly successful under circumstances which
undoubtedly prove its distinct healing power.”—Signed
by Rev. JOHN SINCLAIR, Myers-street, Geelong, and
69 other leading residents.

Gentlemen,
It is with feelings of sin-
cere gratitude that I write
you, saying what wonder-
ful relief “ Warner’s Safe
Cure ” has given me.
I was suffering from
acute disease of the kid-
neys, followed by dropsy,
and was under no less than
seven different doctors for
two years, being in bed
throughout this time. They
each pronounced m> case
hopeless, and I was then
advised to try Warner’s
Safe Cure as a last re-
source, which I did, to-
gether with the Pills, and
after a few bottles I re-
ceived such wonderful bene-
fit as to be able to resume
business.
My case is a well-known
one in Sydney, and all my
friends consider the result
simply miraculous.
I am, Gentlemen,
Yours gratefully,
H. Glenister.

Homoeopathic Chemists,

(Nearly opp. the General Post Office).
Our Dispensers rank among the BEST REAL
and CLEVEREST CHEMISTS in Sydney.
Both Homoeopathic and Allopathic Prescrip-
tions accurately dispensed at low prices.
A recent issue of the Planters’ Monthly con-
tains a description of this remarkable nut and its
uses.
Kola has the property of staying hunger whilst
supporting the struggle for existence. If a supply
of nuts had been included in Mr. Stanley’s outfit,
his men would not have suffered so terribly from
want of animal food.
As might be expected, the value of Kola in-
creases as it makes its way into the interior of
Africa, and some of the tribes farthest removed
from the sea pay for the dry powder an equal
weight of gold dust.
In a despatch from Mr. George Alexander
Stevens, Her Majesty’s Consul at Bahia, he calls
attention to the GREAT POWERS of ENDUR-
ANCE in lifting heavy loads and transporting
them to long distances in the tropical climate
attributed to the free use of Kola Bean. An old
African, after biting a piece of the magic Bean,
lifted 179 English pounds weight on to his head
and carried the same for a distance of four (4) miles.
Still another merit is named, however, which
will interest the Temperance Party. The negroes
who chew Kola Nut nave no desire to drink rum,
and hence save money and retain their strength.
SWAGMAN : “Could yer give us a pipe of tobacco, mate?”
HORSEMAN: “Yes. I can give you some that was made in America. It’s CAMERON’S TWO SEAS—the best
smoke in the world!”

T. Q o gt
BEFORE YOU
T. E -A- F !
When you go out shopping, consider, think
of the money in your pocket, and take account
of the many stores whose various attractions
are laid before you. There is A, with temp-
tation in the form of a pretty show ; there is
B, whose wiles are innumerable ; and 0,
who says that he is the man for your money ;
and so on, throughout a list as long as
George-street, each smiling dealer has some-
thing to say and to offer.
Please Pause!
Hearken not to the song of the syren, sing
she ever so sweetly ; heed not the voice of
the charmer, charm he never so wisely.
Your pocket’s concerned ; and there are
pirates about. As the poet pertinently puts
it: “ There be land-sharks and water-
sharks,” and it is for you to see that your
dealings are with none of these voracious
monsters. Take warning in time, for it will
be no use when the new taxes come round
and the tax-gatherer won’t take no for an
answer—for you to plead : There would have
been enough and to spare had I been wise
enough to

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
OLDEN RHYMES.
Why do ye scorn the rhymes of France,
O Austral song-birds ? And why, pray,
Neglect the joyous old romance,
Sweet echoes of a byegone day ?
There is a beauty in the lay
That mocks old Time’s severest test;
Believe me, singers, when I say
That olden rhymes are far the best.
In their defence I pouch a lance
Of verse at once both grave and gay,
Of honeyed notes,that in life’s dance
Oft ease sad hearts —oft cares allay.
I don my armour for the fray,
And set me forth upon my quest:
To prove to all who say me nay
That olden rhymes are far the best.
Choose Austral themes, in the expanse
Of ballade, rondeau, roundelay,
In these old shapes you will entrance
Both heart and brain to do your sway ;
As a great master who doth play
Some old-time air, lulls us to rest,
And in his mastery doth betray
That olden rhymes are far the best.
Envoy.
Australians, thus your art display !
And so to you my plaint’s addrest:
Remember, when you verse essay,
That olden rhymes are far the best.
DINGO.
NIGHT-PIECE.
The yellow gas is fired from street to street
Past rows of heartless homes and hearths unlit,
Dead churches, and the unending pavement beat
By crowds (say, rather, haggard shades that flit
Round nightly haunts of their delusive dream
Where’er our paradisal instinct starves)
Till, on the utmost post, its sinuous gleam
Crawls in the oily water of the wharves,
Where Homer’s sea loses his keen breath, hemm d
What part rebellious piles were driven down:
The priest-like waters to this task condemn’d,
To wash the roots of the inhuman town !
Where fat and strange-eyed fish, that never saw
The outer deep, broad halls of sapphire light,
Glut in the city’s draught their nameless mawj
And there, wide-eyed unto the soulless night,
Methinks a drown’d maid’s face might fitly show
What we have slain, a life that had been free,
Clean, large, nor thus tormented —even so
As are the skies, the great winds, and the sea.
Ay, we had saved our days and kept them whole,
To whom no part in our old joy remains j
Had felt those bright winds sweeping thro our
soul
And all the keen sea tumbling in our veins ;
Thrill’d to the harps of sunrise, when the height
Whitens and dawn dissolves in virgin tears;
Or caught across the hush’d ambrosial night
The choral musio of the swinging spheres ;
Or drunk the silence, if nought else—But no !
And from each rotting soul distils in dreams
A poison, o’er the old earth creeping slow,
That kills the flowers and curdles the live
streams,
That taints the fresh breath of re-risen day
And reeks across the pale bewilder’d moon. . .
Shall we be cleans’d, and how ? I only pray,
Red flame or deluge, may that end be soon !

“ Yesterday my fancy led
Life of careless tyranny —
Soft to every one but Ted.
“ Rose a moment of white flame
When his eyes looked into mine,
And my heart said with acclaim,
‘ Love, for ever I am thine l ’
“ So the river runs a-cold
Many a morrow, but to be
Snowy elements unrolled
In the warm heart of the sea.”

And peer through the half-open gate.
Up the pathway a bolt is withdrawn,
In the hall for a moment you wait:
Then a rustle of feet in the grass,
A white form is pressed close to me,
And a hand clasped in mine as we pass
Below the pear-tree.
Oh dear is the bench by the pear,
And sweet is the shade of that tree
Through whose leaves when the wind murmurs
there
Our mother moon glances at me,
Watching over us both in the night,
To caution ; to check ; to restrain :
Thanks, that cloud puts an end to her light—
I kiss you again.
Harsh world, though it smarts us and chills,
I am healed of the chill and the smart
By the light that your eyes softly fills,
Welling up from the depth of your heart;
By your delicate hands as they rest
On a head that grows tired in the strife;
By your words that revive in my breast
The pulses of life.

The BONANZA CIGAR.
DIXSON & SONS, by the aid of newly-invented machinery of surprising capa-
city, have placed upon this market at a Price Hitliei’tO Ull-
known ElGl*o a Cigar of exceptional quality.
The Finest Cigar Tobacco in the World
comes from Havana, and arrangements have been made for supplies from
there of the choicest Tobacco (Yuelta Abajo).
BONANZA Cigars are made of this Tobacco, with a necessary portion of
equally-choice Seed Leaf, and together they , form a Cigar second only to the
recognised brands of high-class Havanas.
4 Full-sizetl Cigars for 6d.!!-wm at first no doubt
be prejudicial; but machinery, overcoming the great cost of production, just
permits a Cigar of such quality and weight to be made at a profit. DIXSON
and SONS intend the Bonanza Cigar to illustrate andjprove what can be done.
The “ BONANZA ”
comes as a pleasant surprise to many who, though capable of appreciating a
good Cigar, have lately been prevented through retrenched circumstances from
indulging in the hitherto expensive luxury.
Note-—Sample Boxes of 100 Bonanzas will be sent (carriage paid) to any

\ SATUKDAY, JULY 11, 1896.
A State Three-Ball Establishment.
The Government of Maoriland has already
on its hands a State Life Insurance business,
a Public Trust Office, a (practically) State
Bank, a State Loan Department, State rail-
ways, telegraphs and telephones, and the
huge land business involved in the policy of
resuming estates for closer settlement.
Therefore, it has already gone further in the
direction of practical State Socialism than
any other Government in the world, and the
distinct success of almost all its undertakings
up to date is an evidence that State Socialism
pays well under, good and reasonably-honest
management. In addition to the above and
various other enterprises, the M.L. Govern-
ment has announced its intention of com-
mencing the business of State Fire Insurance,
if Parliament consents ; and, the other day,
Premier Seddon intimated that a system of
State pawnshops was in serious contempla-
tion. Therefore' it is evident that the
Government, and the party by whiph it is
supported—which party constitutes the bulk
of the community—has found no reason,
after good many years’ trial, to re-
gard State-Socialism as a failure, or
to grow weary in what the stereo-
tyl e 1; Tory describes as “grandmotherly
legislation.” And when the people who
have seen the system closest, and lived under
it longest, and had more of it than any other
civilised race at present existing, support it
so consistently, it is difficult to' believe that
State Socialism is the failure that the Argus
and the Telegraph and other heavy-minded
publications constantly proclaim it.
. * * * *
So far, it does not appear with any cer-
tainty whether the Seddon Government pro-
poses merely to compete with the private
pawnbroker, or to refuse renewal of Ins
license and make the business a State mono-
poly. I here are many reasons, ho we ver,
why ;it should follow the latter course if it
goes intoAhe business at all. There are also
many reasons why it should go into the busi-
ness. At present the pawnbroker, like the
publican, is much more numerous than the
business actually requires. Cities like
Auckland, Wellington and Dunedin each
ni)ainbain, probably, six or eight of the
three-ball fraternity where one State estab-
lishment would be amply sufficient for the
work to be done. Therefore the rent and
taxes and gas-bills of all the super-
fluous establishments are a needless
charge on the profits of the business. So are
the food and garish raiment and jewellery
of all the superfluous proprietors and their
wives and families, also the fortunes they
accumulate and ultimately retire with. All
these needless burdens arising from exces-
sive competition have to be met by charging
heavier interest and making smaller advances
on the shirt or the flat-iron or the wedding-
ring which is deposited by the establish-
ment’s careworn customer. If the number
of pawnbroking offices was reduced to as few
as would meet the actual requirements of
the community, instead of being as many as
can be made to yield a profit to the owners,
and they were worked with a view to. yield-
ing, say, 10 per cent, per annum instead of
as much per cent, as could be made out of
them, the saving would be so great that the
interest charge could be reduced one-half
without any serious difficulty. The advan-
tage which would accrue to the borrower is
too obvious to require demonstration.
* ♦ * *
The question of compensating the dis-
possessed Israelites who are ejected from the
business will no doubt be fiercely argued
when the matter begins to take definite
shape—assuming that it does take definite
shape sooner or later, and that the State
aims at making the business an absolute
monopoly, which it certainly should do if its
work is to be anything like complete. The
“ vested interests ” of Moses and Levi will
assuredly rise in insurrection, and the value
of these vested interests, and the question
whether Moses and Levi have any vested
interest at all, will fill the land with clamour
and execration. The Bulletin believes
that neither in a legal nor a moral sense
should the question of compensation be con-
sidered. The pawnbroker is an individual
who carries on his trade under a State
license. The license has to be renewed
yearly, therefore the State, when it issues
the document, guarantees the recipient a
year’s continuance of his right to trade—no
more and no less. There is no pledge or
contract for the renewal of the license if the
State sees any reason for not renewing it;
and the fact that the State has not seen any
such reason so far is not and never has been
a guarantee that it won’t do it at some time
in the future. The positions of the pawn-
broker and the publican in this matter are
identical : in each case the annual license is
an annual reminder that his position is
purely temporary, and that the licensee is
only a yearly tenant. If either of them
has chosen to assume the existence of
any vested interest beyond what is
contained within the four corners of his
permit, that is his own affair and no one
else’s. The State does not compensate the
importer whose business is ruined by the
sudden advent of a protective tariff, nor the
manufacturer whose business is destroyed by
a reversion to Freetrade, nor the State
tenant whose lease it refuses to renew
because the land is required for some more
urgent purpose. Yet the State tenant who
has a lease now is quite as much entitled to
expect a perpetual renewal of it, and to riot
around and demand compensation if he
doesn’t get it, as is the pawnbroker or the
publican.
* * * *
There is one overwhelming reason in favor
of a State pawnbroking system which applies
equally to the Public Trust Department, and
the State Fire Insurance scheme, and many
other developments of State Socialism. If
pawnbroking were made a Government
monopoly, the number of three-ball estab-
lishments, as already pointed out, could be
greatly reduced. The saving in expense,
and the fact that the State desires much
smaller profits than the private broker, would
enable interest to be reduced, and thus lift
a heavy burden off the class least able
to support it. Also, it would very consider-
ably reduce a non-producing section of the
community. The pawnbroker is not a pro-
ducer ; therefore he, like every other of his
kind, must needs live on the man who is.
He is necessary—for the present, at all events
—but he is not necessary in anything like
the existing quantity. If a State pawn-shop
system can reduce the number of people en-
gaged in the trade by one-half or two-
thirds, and can force at least some of the
dispossessed three - ball men either to
become producers or to leave the country,
then there are so many less burdens on the
producing classes. The Bulletin advocates
a State Drink Department for the same
reason, among a hundred others : it
would reduce the number of non-produc-
tive publicans, of whom the country has
to support far too many. It advocates
the totalisator in like manner, in order to
reduce the number of unproductive book-
makers and their hangers-on ; and it wants
to see some restriction put on the multiplicity
of small, mean, disreputable racing-clubs,
because they tend to multiply jockeys,
trainers, touts, welshers, and other useless
excrescences. The Public Trust Office in
Maoriland has done good work by largely
diminishing the unproductive class of private
trustees. In insolvency matters Maoriland
gets through with one Official Bankruptcy
Assignee in each important centre ; Sydney
has four ; while in Melbourne, under the
worst bankruptcy system in Australasia,
one or two hundred so-called trustees, most of
them more or less disreputable, live, more or
less dishonestly, on the game, and serve as an
awful example of hovy the wholly useless per-
son multiplies in the land. The men who pro-
duce nothing—neither food, clothing or other
tangible wealth, knowledge of any kind or
rational amusement—form a class which
should be kept down to the smallest numbers
which the requirements of our civilisation
admit of, and any change which enables the
community to get on equally well with one
lawyer, pawnbroker or bookmaker the less, or
with one less broker, financier, commission-
agent, trustee in bankruptcy, or other non-
producer, is a change for the better.
• • * »
The State pawnshop system is by no means
a new experiment. It is no rash plunge into
the deep waters of the unknown. The
French, in some respects the most eminently
practical people in Europe, have followed the
same system for very many years with re-
markable success, and if the practical Anglo-
Saxon cannot do the same then it is time for
him to give up making unpleasant remarks
about his alleged superiority. The pawn-
broking business is, in some respects, better
suited for State management than almost any
other. It is a species of finance in which—
unlike banking —advances do not lie dormant
for years while the security, it may be,
deteriorates to nothing. If the pledges are
redeemed, the profit is certain and the
amount of it is obvious. If they are not
redeemed they are sold at the expiry of a
few months, and then the aggregate profit
or loss is equally obvious. All that is re-
quired is an honest and capable and well-
paid civil servant of the Jewish persuasion
(such a person is more easily found in the
nation of Moses than in any other) to
manage the business, and a staff whose
aggregate nose is a guarantee of its capacity.
The new department would probably make
mistakes, and Parliamentary commissions
would inquire into its doings now and then,
and now and then “ revelations” would come
to light, but these things are inevitable.
The mismanagement of State enterprise
almost always comes to light sooner or later
per medium of the inevitable Parliamentary
inquiry, and it is well that it should.
The mismanagement of private enterprise,
on the other hand, only comes to light
in any extensive sense, probably once in
10,000 times. Three-fourths of the shop-
keepers in any average street fade away
inside of 10 years through incapacity, and
the average life of a company is far below 10
years ; but, except when 12 banks stop
simultaneously, and half the building socie-
ties go bung at once, and 90 per cent, of all
the land companies of a continent shut-up
together, and three land-grant railways and
the Mildura Irrigation scheme, and the
Ward Farmers’ Association, get into trouble
together, the persistent failure of private
enterprise is little noticed.
* * * *
One question which is perpetually asked
by the Tory press upon every new develop-
ment of State-Socialism is : What is to be
the end of the system % Also, how far is it
to go, and whither is it leading ? Is it to go
on expanding for ever ? Will its advocates
ever be satisfied, or will they keep on want-
ing more of it perpetually 1 To these ques-
tions The Bulletin, which is a warm and
consistent advocate of State Socialism, and
desires to see it developed at a much faster
pace than it is now going, replies cheerfully
that it doesn’t know. The problem of
finality, which is whooped up as a convincing
argument every time a new step is taken, is
a supremely childish one at the best.
Nobody knows for certain where anything
is leading to. Maoriland has now something
like £40,000,000 invested in State enter-
prises, and it may go on till it has
£100,000,000 so invested—or £1,000,000,000
for that matter. When it does, presumably
the work will be too vast for six Ministers,
and 16 may be wanted—or perhaps 26.
When it gets to that point it will probably
be almost as far from complete satisfaction as
it is now, for nobody is ever satisfied. The
great A.M.P. Society, with its £13,000,000
of accumulated funds, is scrambling for more
business and more funds as actively as when
it had only £100,000; it will probably be
scrambling with the same activity when it
has £50,000,000, yet no one asks in a scared
voice where it is going to or when it is going
to stop. One of the American offices doing
business in Australia has more accumulated
assets than all the money which the Maori-
land Government has invested in all its
Socialistic enterprises combined, yet the
time when it will definitely arrive at the
place it is going to, wherever that may be,
and assuming there is any such place, isn’t
necessarily any nearer. Possibly a time
must come to everything when it can’t grow
any larger without something happening,
but no one knows when it is or what
it is that will happen. Presumably there
will arrive a period when State Socialism
can’t go any further without becoming un-
manageable, just as there must be a time
when population can’t get any larger for
want of standing-room, and when interest
must cease falling because otherwise money
won’t pay for removal and the inspector of
nuisances will order it to be shifted out of
the back lane and buried ; but there is no
more present reason to worry over one con-
tingency than over the other. Nobody really
knows where anything is going to in this
world, or where anything has gone to in the
next, or what will be the final end of any-
thing. Therefore, there is much truth in
the Tory papers’ statement that if the
socialistic policy of the Maoriland Govern-
ment isn’t checked no one can tell to what
lengths it may be carried. For it is impos-
sible to say definitely, in this unfinished
world, to what lengths anything may be
carried if it isn’t checked.
The Legal Aspect of Ikey Mo.
Every now and then, for some occult reason,
the police are galvanised into activity, and the
country is called upon to approve of their zeal
and energy in closing up a few tote-shops and
betting-houses. The latest N.S. W. case is that
at Kensington, Sydney. Col. Sec. Brunker in
the House, a little time ago, excused the pro-
secution of some men who were betting outside
the Kensington course, while those betting inside
were not molested, by saying that the course was
not a “ place ” within the meaning of the Act,
and therefore Ikey Mo might there carry on his
operations with impunity. This is the “lie
that is half a truth ” which is so hard to meet.
If Mr. Brunker meant to imply that the law
is not stringent enough to prevent betting on
race-courses, be erred, and that without excuse
for his error—for what is the use of a high-
priced Attorney - General and Crown Solicitor
if M.nisters cannot go to them for legal advice ?
If those who permit betting on the various race-
courses of the province were not amenable to
the law, no complaint could be made. “If”
they were not— that is the point. Everybody is
aware that the various racing clubs issue per-
mits to the members of the bookmaking frater-
nity, allowing them to use the reserves for the
purpose of betting ; and, moreover, obtain a
considerable revenue from the fees charged for
such permission. On any race-day betting is
there carried on under the very eyes of the
police, with the knowledge and connivance of
the club authorities. If Govt, is really desirous
of putting down gambling on horse-races, let
it attack the racing clubs. An attempt was
made a few years ago (by a private person, of
course) to render the A.J.C. liable, and the
case went to the Supreme Court on appeal.
The club won. That case (Davis v. White,
(5 N.S. W. R. 96) is authoritative, and must be
followed by the lower Courts until over-ruled :
and over-ruled it must be whenever it comes
under review, for it is bad law.

The Betting-house Suppression Act, 39 Vic.,
No. 28, sec. 1, forbids the keeping or using of
any house, room, or other place where money,
or any other valuable tiling, may be received in
consideration of a promise or undertaking to
pay or give any money or valuable thing on any
event or contingency relating to a horse-race ;
or as a consideration for the giving, by some
person, of any money or valuable thing on any
such contingency. Section 3 renders liable any-
one who keeps such a place, or knowingly
permits it to be used for such purposes. Now,
in the case mentioned (Davis v. White),
Davis proceeded against James White, chair-
man of the A.J. Club, for knowingly per-
mitting the St. Leger reserve (Randwick) to be
used in a manner forbidden by the Betting Act
(sec. 3). The magistrate convicted ; but the
Supreme Court, on appeal, set aside the convic-
tion. The case ultimately turned on the ques-
tion whether Mr. White had permitted the
reserve to be used for book betting or for
cash and ticket betting. The evidence showed
that cash and ticket betting had been
forbidden by the defendant and that he had
only permitted book betting. The Court held
that book betting, where no money passed, was
not illegal, and that the Act only referred to
cash or ticket betting—betting when money or a
valuable thing is given in consideration of a
promise to pay. Martin, C.J., said :
There must be more than mere betting- carried on
it must be where money or some valuable thing is received"
by or on behalf of some other person. That is the kind of
betting the Legislature has made it penal for anyone to
allow on his land.
Manning, J., concurred. So this case decides
that book betting, where no money passes on
either side, is legal, and that a promise to pay
is not a “valuable consideration” within the
meaning of the Act. Will it be believed that,
at the time this decision was given, there was
on the statute-book an Act (43 Vic. No. 30)
amending the Betting Act, the first section of
which enacts that the words “ valuable thing”
in the Principal Act shall include a promise to
pay ! Reading the main Act, in the light of
the amendment, the conclusion that the case of
Davis v. White was wrongly decided is irre-
sistible. The Bulletin has no objection to
betting, and does not see why a man should not
be allowed to put a “little bit” on his
“ fancy,” if he feels so inclined ; but it has a
great interest in seeing that the laws are im-
partially administered ; and that the gentleman
“ bookie,” with the white waistcoat" and top-
hat, is not permitted to do with impunity
things which would earn a few weeks’ free
board and lodgings for his humbler friend in
moles.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The N.S.W. Steel Rails Job.
Ihb conduct of N.S.W. “ absolutely-Free-
trade Government in calling tenders for the
local manufacture, out of local ores, with local
coal and by local workmen, of 150,000 tons of
steel rails and other railway material is a
decidedly good thing for the suffering country
from a Protectionist point of view. From a
Freetrade standpoint it is utterly indefensible,
and when it is done by a Government which is
appointed to support Freetrade and paid for
doing so, the inference is that that Government
is too much ashamed of its own mean, inhuman
creed to live up to it. Another inference is
that the Government is getting its salary under
false pretences quite as much as if it passed a
valueless cheque at a threepenny public-house.
A Freetrade Government which wasn’t ashamed
of its creed would call for tenders from all the
world, and take the cheapest article it could get
of the right quality, whether it was made in
New South Wales, or Germany, or China, or
Gehenna. Minister Young’s' defence of the
hiatus between the principles and the practice
of the GoD-fearing Ministry is that it believes
it can get the rails made locally as cheaply as it
can get them from abroad, but this defence
won’t bear examination. As the only tenders


are to be local ones it will simply be necessary
to say that the lowest local offer is as cheap as
any foreign one could be—there being no foreign
one, on a 150,000-ton basis, to compare it with
—and no one will be able to absolutely disprove
the assertion. If the Ministry really believed
its own statement it would have called for
tenders from all the world, and proved by actual
results that the local tender was the cheapest.
When a Government, whose creed it is that the
local and foreign producer should have an abso-
lutely equal chance, carefully shuts out the
foreigner on the ground that he couldn’t have
got in anyhow, and doesn’t allow’ him to dis-
prove the statement, its conduct is so incon-
sistent with all its theories that it deserves to
be ejected from office instantly. The country
put in the Reid Government on the Freetrade
ticket, and when it fails to supply Freetrade
then some other Ministry with the courage of
its convictions should take its place. If the
country changes its mind and wants Protection,
then it wants Protection for all local manufac-
turers equally ; not Protection for the Premier’s
friend, Mitchell, or any other single indivi-
dual, or for any single industry. One point
worth noting is that the steel-rail job, if carried
out, will be about the most comprehensive act
of Protection ever known in N.S. Wales.
The contract will probably extend over 10
years. Therefore whatever happens, the man
who gets the contract will be protected for 10
years against outside competition. The Dibbs
Government’s duties were so fixed that, if the
country declared against them, the new Parlia-
ment could remove them in a day, if it wanted
to. The Reid kind of Protection is to be fixed
so that, however much the country declares
against it, it must go on till well into next
century. Moreover, the Dibbs variety of Pro-
tection stated openly that the local manufac-
turer received a certain fixed and recognised
percentage of advantage over the foreigner,
which percentage was openly decided by Parlia-
ment. The Reid variety means an unknown
percentage which is not fixed by Parliament,
but arranged by a GoD-fearing Ministry. Alto-
gether, the proposed steel rail contract is one of
the strangest things that an allegedly Free-
trade Cabinet ever muddled with.
Another Midland Railway.
I£t is generally understood that the Perth Go-
vernment will shortly foreclose upon the bank-
rupt Midland Railway of Westralia. The
■concern is another example of the rottenness
•of the land-grant railway system, and of the
incapacity of the British jobbers and financiers,
;and of the fact that “ private enterprise ” is not
what it is cracked up to be. The Midland co.
sstarted in 1890, just when the boom was be-
ginning. It was subsidised by the State with
12,000 acres of land for each mile of line
lopened, and if this endowment —reckoning town
and country lands alike—was worth even only
'2s. an acre it represented a subsidy of £I2OO a
mile. The line is 277 miles in length, over a
country that is almost level throughout. The
cost of building and equipment of the Govern-
ment lines of Westralia, under about the worst
State management known in Australasia, is
only £3804 per mile, and, even. allowing that
private enterprise is so much more expensive
than the State article as to run the cost up to
<£4ooo, the total charge of building the Midland
and putting it in thorough working order should
not have exceeded £1,108,000. The co. started
with a nominal capital of £1,200,000, which
should have been more than sufficient, without
the big land-grant, for all purposes. But the
money never existed except on paper, and the
Midland was presently stranded with its work
hardly begun. Then it raised <£736,800 on de-
bentures at 6 per cent, and “ blewed” that also,
and went aground again. No one seriously
expected that the line would, for a long while
at all events, pay more than about 3 per cent,
on its fair cost, else there would have been no
reason for the big land grant, and when three-
;fourths of what ought to have been the fair cost
vwas borrow’ed at 6 per cent., the prospect of
jpaying interest, let alone paying dividends, was
hopeless. Then <£500,000 more was
iraised at 4 per cent, upon the guarantee of the
Westralian Government, saying nothing of
(other items of State' assistance in between
times, and the Midland line was finished. It
was started by State assistance and finished
by State assistance ; but for the aid given by
the State it would have fallen through ignomi-
niously. There was no private money in it
save what was borrowed on the security of the
State land-grant and again on the State
guarantee; yet it is described as private
enterprise to this date. The amount given
by the State in the shape of land and
the amount lent by the State would have
more than sufficed to build it as a State pro-
perty at Westralian rates. The co. ceased
to pay interest on its 6 per cent, bonds in 94,
and it paid the interest on the State 4 per cent,
loan for one half-year only—the rest of the
interest having come out of the Treasury.
Therefore, unless the co. meets its liabilities,
■which seems utterly impossible, the Forrest
•Government must needs foreclose on the pro-
perty. If it costs merely the land grant, and
ii he ‘£509,000 advanced on the guarantee,
and the interest arrears, the State will
acquire the Midland line for just about
ahe price the State might have built it for
in the beginning. If the .£736,000 of deben-
tures and the ,£BO,OOO or so arrears of interest
thereon are a lien upon the line, and the State
Us as to take over these liabilities also—which
*eems just now’ a matter of some uncertainty—
then it will get its Midland Railway, per
medium of private enterprise, at something
anore than one-and-a-half times as much as it
would have cost by the ordinary processes of
State construction. Too much London office
and office staff, and expensive London director,
and travelling expenses for useless experts, and
100 much champagne, and needless salary, and
boodle, and commission, and ridiculous financ-
ing at impossible rates of interest, and too
much frill generally seem to have sw’amped the
Midland Railway of W.A. just as they did the
other Midland of M.L. The people who talk
about the extravagance of State railway man-
agement should consider these two wonderful
examples of how private enterprise does the
business, and learn a valuable lesson therefrom.
Thp Modern Scapegoat —Drink !
A Balmain (Sydney) “ temperance demonstra-
tion ” has carried a resolution expressing the
“ belief ” of “ citizens ” that “ the unrestricted
sale of intoxicating liquors is the cause of an
overwhelming portion of the crime, lunacy, and
domestic misery of the people.” Analysing a
self-styled “ temperance demonstration ” is
always a curious task. Its reigning deity is
Aitemperance. The breath of its temperance
lungs is intemperate. Its temperance statistics
are intemperate. Its denunciations are intem-
perate. Its very resolutions are intemperate.
Notice the wording above quoted—“ That the
unrestricted sale,” &c. The concealed hint is
palpable that N.S.W. endures (or enjoys?)
“ the unrestricted sale of intoxicating liquors.’
There is no such luck (good or bad). The sale
of intoxicating liquors is “ restricted ” in very
visible ways, and the intemperate “ temper-
ance demonstrators ” know it, perhaps, better
than any other set of citizens. It follows,
therefore, that their motion of intemperate
words either means nothing at all but bad gas,
or that it deliberately cloaks a lie. The intem-
perate “temperance demonstrators” are wel-
come to cling to either horn of that dilemma.
To that motion up spoke the whole-teapot
Parson Boyce, a worthy bigot, with a mania
for delirious statistics, to this effect: —
N.S. Wales has 58 gaols, besides innumerable [that no
computer can number !] lock-ups and watohhouses,
largely required for the victims of the drink-tramc.
There are two coroners’ inquests a week on an average,
and a leading physician has declared that there are not a
tenth of the deaths coming under this head which are not
directly attributable to drink. Mr. Ralston has further
stated that 75 per cent, of the divorce-cases in the pro-
vince are to he traced to the same cause.
“ Yus ! Putt it all down to the drink.” “ The
drink ”is a popular object to curse. Its
shoulders are broad. It is the champion
seducer of the “interesting criminal.” “ How
came you here, my poor man ? ” asks the gaol
parson. “The cursed Drink !” is the snuffled -
back whimper. Nine times out of ten a lie,
because it is a lie that plays right into the par-
son’s hands ; it is a lie he seeks, a lie he asks
for, and a lie that he makes the most of on the
platform. Criminality knows better than to
drink hard. Criminality wants its sharp
“ business ” wits about it. Criminality styles
the drinker a “mug ”
The Future Australian.
Ed. Bulletin, —Meditative philosophers, pon-
dering the future of this continent, begin to
see that Australia is forming a racial type. The
Briton may be picked out in the Sydney and
Melbourne streets, not only by his ruddy com-
plexion, but by liis larger and more rugged
features. Our boys are smaller in the bone,
shorter - headed, shorter - faced, with features
like the hero of the Family |lerald and the
typical Greek statue. This statement applies
to the second or third generation of “colo-
nials ”; the first crop are often abnormal
in physical development, a Beach, Bon-
nor, or Stanbury. Thirty years ago, it is
said, it was hard to find a man in Windsor
(Hawkesbury, N.S.W’.) under 6ft. Now’ it
would take time to find one over. A first
transplanting often has this effect. The early
Yankees were giants ; the average has since de-
clined below the British standard ; and a
Boston professor, with many curious facts to
support him, has written to prove that the
while American, in character and feature, is
rapidly approaching the Red Indian. Our
transformation on this continent to aborigi-
nals is not so rapid, but the variation in
that direction has begun ; we are losing
the calves of the leg, the wing of the nostril is
expanding to the warmer air, and the firm
mouth of hard winter is changing to the loose,
thick lips of a buoyant atmosphere. Like the
blackfellow, our diet is chiefly meat, which has
lost us the ancestral paunch, and with our
“cheques ” we indulge in periodic corrobborees
and disdain the Briton’s weekly drunk. Our
complexion, already sallow, has taken the first
step on the road toyellow, brown, and black.
Like “King Billy,” we have no religion or
reverence worth mentioning, and our language
is getting florid, not to say oriental —perhaps
from much bullock-punching—and we have no
sentiment, not a cent. The beautiful Australian
heroine does not languish at home in the bark-
shanty waiting the appearance of the devoted
lover ; she puts on her best clothes and goes out
to hunt for a man ; and later, the said man,
often as not, sits on a fence and smokes while
the heroine runs the churn or wash-tub that
keeps the house going. The black native clubs
his lubra with a waddy before he marries her :
the white man still postpones this ceremony to
a later date, buthe gets there all the same.—
H.F.
The proposal of Griffith, M.L.A., that N.S.
Wales should refuse to meet the Queensland
delegates to the Federal Convention because
they are apparently to be nominated by Par-
liament instead of being elected by the people,
w'as a clumsy piece of self-advertisement.
The agreement made by the preliminary Con-
vention does not legally bind Queensland
or any other province to appoint its dele-
gates in any w'ay except the way it darned
well pleases. The nominees of Queensland and
(possibly) Westralia can be voted down if
necessarv by the elected delegates of the four
other provinces, so that the Kanaka, represen-
tatives can’t make a nigger-labor constitution
for all Australia ; they may refuse to fall
in with the constitution formed by the ma-
jority from the white provinces, but, if
so, that only means that Queensland will
stand out of the Federation for the present.
Anyhow, there is just a possibility that the
delegates of the Kanaka and Leper Ministry
may be more reasonable than is expected, and
that, when the Convention draws up a reason-
ably democratic Federal constitution by virtue
of its white majority, even the nigger-province
may, by some unlooked-for chance, assent. If
it is proposed to throw out its delegates on their
aggregate ear at the very beginning, or to stay
away and leave them all by themselves, then
there Is no possibility of agreement. As the
Kanakaland delegates, whatever their inten-
tions may be or however they may be elected,
can’t force the other four provinces into
federating on nigger and Chinese principles,
the proposal to begin the great work of union
by heaving a large piece of mud at the partner
who most requires diplomatic treatment is cer-
tainly impolitic. Assuming that Queensland
stands out of the Federation now, because the
other provinces won’t agree to the continuance
of black labor in Australia, or for some other
cause, the proposal to bounce out her represen-
tatives before they have had time to say so
isn’t calculated to promote her adhesion to the
Commonwealth later on. Also, there is some-
thing grotesque about the idea of beginning the
great work of union and brotherly love by kick-
ing the brother who doesn’t look so affectionate
as he ought to be.
Victorian Postal Enquiry has exposed to
astonished outsiders some of the local service
secret-society scandals. Amongst other things,
evidence relating to an anonymous letter from
the “ Queen’s Own ” charging a “ Pope’s Own ”
man with pilfering and other crimes is interest-
ing .
Sir, —We wish to draw your attention to a man in the
Telegraph Department known as cable-jointer Sullivan.
For some time past, and at the present, he has been and is
carrying on a system of pilfering from the Telegraph store-
yard, Elizabeth-st. north. To our knowledge he has taken
a vyce and several other articles. About the first week in
December of last year, on arriving at the yard at 8 a.m.,
we found that he had a considerable amount of timber
(used for making arms to telegraph-poles) stowed in the
shed, which he hurriedly cut into shorter lengths and had
it taken home for the purpose of making a wardrobe for
the Daylesford Convent, of which his sister is the Mother
Superior. He has a lathe which is not required, as far as
his duties are concerned, but he uses it day after day in
making things for his own private use. Two weeks ago
he made some stands for images to be placed in the new
Catholic school at Brunswick. We have every reason to
believe that the material used came from the yard.
Though this charge was afterwards acknow-
ledged by the “ Queen’s Own ” to be ground-
less and false, yet no sort of reparation was
made. This is bad enough, but the Public
Works Dept, secret society scandal far out-
shines the G.P.O. (writes a Bulletin corres-
pondent). One man was absolutely dismissed
on the strength of an anonymous letter. Two
were transferred as being enemies to the Pope’s
Own, and during the late retrenchments nearly
every man recommended for dismissal was
opposed to the society which then “ ruled the
roost.”
The municipalities of New South Wales have
started to bray hard at the Treasury door for
more subsidy, and Treas. Reid promises to
think over the matter. The municipal problem
in New South Wales stands somewhat as
follows : the incorporated districts represent
about one-hundredth part of the area of the
province, about two-thirds of the population, and
about one-half of the wealth. If the municipali-
ties are not subsidised they have to pay their
own local expenses, and they also pay through
the general revenue about two-thirds of the
local expenses of the districts which are not in-
corporated. If they are subsidised, then the
great object of local government —to relieve
the Treasury, and abolish the roads and bridges
member, and to prevent governments living by
a judicious distribution of culverts and the like
—is wrecked. Obviously, a complete system
of local government should be established first.
Then there should either be no subsidies at all,
or they should only be given to the very poor
districts far back, where there is a great extent
of roads to keep up and very little revenue to
do it with ; and even then they should only be
given provided the districts tax themselves up
to a certain limit, and don’t allow more than a
certain fixed proportion of the taxes to go in
arrear. And, above all, they should be definitely
fixed by Act of Parliament so that no Govern-
ment can buy support by the road-and-culvert
vote any longer.
N.S.W. Government is trying to seriously
tackle the irrigation difficulty. The prelimin-
ary trouble is that no one has any legal or de-
fined right to use the water of any stream for
irrigation purposes in any defined way. There-
fore, if he uses it all and leaves the man below
him dry, or if he builds a dam and drowns out
the man above him, they can either blacken his
eye as a short and unsatisfactory remedy, or
they can go to law under no definite statute,
and have the case tried six times until all the
property of all parties goes in costs. If a man
builds expensive irrigation-works on his land,
they are of no value without water ; and as he
has no defined right to the water, which is
purely a steal, it becomes a question if the
works are improvements within the meaning of
any Act, or if the man who sells them simply
ranks with the man who sells an extensive cow-
stealing practice with plant and tools attached.
Also, it doesn’t seem to be known for certain
whether the State owns the water, or if it be-
longs to the man whose land it is passing at
the moment, without prejudice to the l ights of
the man down below whose land it will pass a
few minutes later. The irrigation-question is a
pretty large one, and the Act which puts it
straight will be the biggest Act in Australia.
Mr. Justice Simpson has been elucidating some
more queer N.S.W. divorce-law. Brother
Simpson found that a husband had been guilty
of adultery and cruelty, and that, therefore,
aspected as against those offences, the wife was
entitled to a divorce ; but he also found that
the wife had been guilty of adultery, and that,
viewed in that aspect, the husband was entitled
to a divorce ; further, that because both parties
were, in particular aspects, entitled to a di-
vorce, therefore both were, in general aspects,
disentitled to it. It is an old grammatical
adage that “ two negatives make an affirma-
tive?’ but here is a learned Judge’s ruling
that two affirmatives make a negative, and not
only a negative, but a double-barrelled negative,
and not only a double-barrelled negative, but
two negatives. Brother Simpson would seem to
look upon a rule nisi in divorce as a sort of Prize
for Good Gonduct, instead of a relief for bur-
dened linkmates. If Mr. sins and Mrs. is good
(or not found out), Mrs. can get a divorce, or
vice versa ; but if both break all decencies of
contract, the contract is still to continue bind-
ing. Which is not the case with any other
contract known to human wit. The logic of
the law of divorce is the logic of a bent nail: it
wants to be straightened out on the anvil of
common-sense before it can be properly driven
home. If Brother Simpson correctly interprets
the Alfred Stephen Divorce Act, then the
sooner that Act is amended by giving relief to
mutual sinners who have been found out, as well
as to those who have not been found out, the
better. _
Another outrage on the sacred principle of
“freedom of contract” is contemplated, this
time by the very people who are most strenuous
in the assertion of the principle when its in-
fringement is likely to do a little good to starv-
ing workmen or maimed factory-operatives. A
great conference of Chambers of Commerce of
the Empire is being held in London, and it has
decided, on the motions of prominent “freedom
of contract ” advocates, to approach ship-
owners with a view to inducing them to omit
the usual terms in bills-of-lading by which the
shipowner contracts himself out of all liability.
A motion was carried that if the shipowners
refuse, Parliament be approached with a view
of inducing it to enact that the principle or
freedom of contract be not held sacred, and
that, as between shippers and shipowners, the
shipowner shall be held liable whatever the
words of the contract may be. What an outcry
would be raised if proposals were made that
Parliament should limit interest on mortgages
to a reasonable amount, or should ensure that
employes of commercial men would receive a
reasonable wage, notwithstanding the actual
terms of the contracts !
The proposal to extend the N.S.W. railways as
far as Broken Hill has at least one thing to
recommend it, inasmuch as it will make a shorter
overland connection between Sydney and Ade-
laide. Therefore it ought to do something for
the N.S.W. back-country. Hitherto all the
lines between the principal Australian cities
have plodded along the coast, or as near it as
tliev could get. The railways that stretch
inland go nowhere except to a stoppage in the
middle of a desert. Practically the only road
from the Barrier to Sydney (700 miles) is about
1500 miles long via Adelaide ; and the only way
to Adelaide from the western end of the Queens-
land lines is over 2000 miles (1000 longer than
it need be) round by Brisbane, Sydney, and
Melbourne. The fact that all the great through
railways keep near the coast has helped to keep
population in a thin fringe around the sea-
board. Probably the Broken Hill railway,
if it is constructed, however cheaply, will
be a loss for a number of years, yet in a
national sense there is certainly something to
be said in its favor.
Melbourne Argus has struck a positively un-
deniable reason why its friend Fat Man should
go free from any further taxation. “ New
taxes,” wails the Rich Man’s organ, “must
make further inroads on the wage-fund. Ihe
employer, 'who is levied upon to make up
revenue, will be tempted to recoup himself by
savings in other items of expenditure. This is
by no means an unimportant consideration.”
On the same basis, Fat Man should be let off
old taxes as well as new ones. Consider the
details of the business. If Fat Man spends
,£lOOO in wages and the State takes £lOO from
him in taxes, he may manage to take it all out
of his workmen by reducing wages from £1
to 18s., or, again, he may not. The probabili-
ties are that he won’t manage to pass on all the
loss, anyway. Therefore, let the tax be levied
instead on the Lean Man who receives the
wages, and his £1 is reduced to 18s. to
a dead certainty. The way the Argus doesn’t
want it to be, the loss may come wholly or in
part out of the wage-fund. Also, it may come
out of the fund that pays for imported wines
and jewellery and Brussels carpet. The only
other way—obviously the way the Argus wants
it to be—the loss must come wholly out of the
wage-fund. And the Argus wants to fix things
so that the loss will come wholly out of the
wage-fund through sympathy with the people
who receive wages. Rats ! The Bulletin
doesn’t exactly know the meaning of “ Rats ”
in this connection, but there seems to be a vague
appropriateness about it somewhere.
When Bell, the Yarra Glen seducer, was found
guilty of perjury at Melb., last week, Barrister
Coldham tried to put in proofs of the prisoner’s
previous good character. But Justice A BxtCKETT
would have none of them. “ It.only makes the
prisoner’s case worse,” he explained, and then,
after saying many nasty things to Bell,
awarded him three years hard. Regarding the
nasty remarks of the Judge, The Bulletin has
nothing to say. But the contention of
Judge A’Beckett that prior good char-
acter only aggravated the offence is a
startling precedent to introduce into crim-
inal procedure. It’s a bad rule that won’t
work both ways, and, to be consistent, Mr.
A’Beckett will be bound to regulate all his
future sentences according to the number of
prior convictions. For instance, if first-offender
Jones stands convicted by the side of Sikes,
the proud possessor of a record of 18 items, he
will be awarded five years and copious floggings,
while Mr. Sikes aforesaid will be fined 5s —“ or
the rising of the court.” Judicial logic is truly
a fearful and wonderful thing.
Oughtn’t the “ GoD-fearing” N.S.W. Govt, to
reprimand Astronomer Russell ? Under Bibbs
and Parkes the people had been desperately
wicked, and so, standing in need of punish-
ment, a drought was sent. Then they turned
from their evil ways —as shown by their en-
gagement of a “ GoD-fearing Ministry.” So
the drought being no longer necessary, Govt,
officially fixed a day for prayer and humiliation;
and, when the lawns about Sydney had been
watered, also a day of rejoicing—prayer had
been answered. Now, however, this Govt,
servant, Russell, boldly states that droughts
are the outcome of a natural law, which has
been in existence for thousands of years, and

The “Trip to Chinatown” is doing im-
mense business at Sydney Lyceum, which shows
that a very large number of people don’t take this
paper’s view of that eminently sketchy perform-
ance. Therefore, The Bulletin is once more in
an intelligent minority ; the condition of its liver
prevents it from complacently enduring so much
long-drawn talkee-talkee as a set-off to the several
undeniably bright things with which the show is
relieved. Frank Lawton, the melodious whistler,
agile step-dancer and bones-artist, at once fully
established himself a gallery-god. Harry Conor’s
Welland Strong, the hypochondriac who prefers to
be treated by horse-doctors, and whose tern-,
perature, as per his gigantic pocket-ther-
mometer, goes up with a rush when he kisses
u pretty girl, •is a performance uniquely
humorous; Miss Geraldine M‘Gann's shapely
widow is also considerably over-proof, and
Miss Bessie Clayton’s pas-seul is a wondrous dis-
play alike of dancing and contortion. Also, Miss
Sadie M‘Donald’s French maid is a gladsome per-
formance ; but the alleged play itself, which serves
as the thread whereby the bouquet is held together,
is distressingly weak. And, although there is a
lot of talent about the co., it doesn’t shine with any
reliable lustre in a musical sense. The Quaker
duet by Harry Conor and Miss M‘Cann is a very
pretty affair; but when the stout baritone stands
up and sings to the stout tenor on the sofa, and
the stout tenor professes to look glad that he is
being sung to, it inspires a lot of sombre thought
in some people—whatever effect it may have on
some other people. The “ Trip ” seems to be in
for a long and profitable run, but this paper gives
up attempting to understand public enthusiasm
with regard to it. Possibly it is part of the general
incomprehensibleness of things,' or possibly the
painted loveliness of the last scene has something
to do with it. Since the first night the jaw-jaw
has been compressed with much advantage.

The luck of Her Majesty’s has turned in
some slight degree—in fact, for the last week
theatrical matters have improved all round, pos-
sibly through the butter-duty being taken off.
Inman has been pursuing his gore-and-scalp-
strewn path as the ’Murkan desperado with good
support, and larger audiences have encouraged
Darrell to go after him and capture him in the
name of “the lor.” Miss Lilia Wilde, as the
lady-tough with the fruit and paper stall, has
grown upon the affections of the audience, and the
capable manner in which she sings out the
hevenink ’orror ”is much admired. As a further
example, of the fitness of things this lady got
mixed up with two tramcars, the other day, and
nearly provided an unpremeditated horror of her
own. Manager Woods’s benefit is fixed for Mon-
day afternoon. A strong cominit.ce, with the in-
evitable Dan. O’Connor as chairman, has the
matter in end, and this combined with Woods’s
personal popularity should lead to good cash re-
sults. Some time in the unspecified future Charles
Holloway is to play a season at H.M.’s.
** * *
“The Derby Winner,” at Sydney Royal,
is booming to the last—in fact, it has boomed of
late with a wilder, madder boom than ever before.
It is still doing its last nights prior to the arrival
of the “Woman’s Revenge,” but the date of that
embittered female seems a little uncertain.
** * *
William Crackles, who has been with Rick-
ards’ Melbourne show for some time past, turned
up at Sydney Tivoli on Saturday. The Bulle-
tin’s opinion of Crackles in Sydney is much the
same as its views on Crackles were in Melbourne,
and the fact that he is very like Coleman in some
respects, or that Coleman is very like him, is a
sufficient recommendation. Godfrey is doing his
last three weeks at the Tivoli, and if he is really
going this time he will be much missed. The
Sydney Music Hall is doing the same as last week
—in fact, all Sydney is doing much the same as
last week. All the old shows are keeping well,
but there isn’t an absolutely new show anywhere.
•* * * *
The Trebelli concert-season has been so
profitable that the management decided to keep
its sweet singer on at Sydney Town Hall for one
more week.. It is generally understood, however,
that the nightingale can’t be further extended
upon any account whatever, by vice-regal com-
mand or otherwise, and that she takes flight
shortly after this plain, dull statement appears in
print.

Sardou’s tragedy of “La Tosca,” in five
acts and four long adjournments to the wetsome
buffet, is the current event at Melb. Princess’s
Novelty has departed from this tale of sudden
death since Mrs. Potter and Bellew first came to
Australia, and it is now criticised in cold blood as
a play comprising two large parts and a smaller
one. The leading lady murdefs the polished
villain, and commits suicide when her lover has
been riddled with bullets. A fugitive conspirator
may be mentioned casually, inasmuch as he also
falls forfeit to the undertaker—behind the scenes.
“La Tosca ”is rich in funeral matter. Opening
with an air of bright amorousness, it soon drops
into gory bandages and gloom, therefore histrionic
art alone can justify such a gruesome revival. In
the present case, the justification is insufficient
Mrs. Potter’s choppy chanting of passionate lines
distracts appreciation from her good points, and
the charming-diva of the earlier scenes gets almost
kf°ivr memor y by the studied eccentricity
of Mrs. Potter, as she appears when roused. Her
attempts to play the jealous 'woman and
wild tigress are unreal. Formerly, she exer-
CIS( J :< l a little magnetic influence over her
audience; nowadays her mannerisms lack power
and her groans seem to issue from the chest rather
than from a harrowed soul. Bellew’s performance
of Baron Scarpia has taken, here and there, a
Boucicaultian turn during his travels, but in most
places the actor repeats the virtues and faults of
his original work. His plotting, scowling, and
dissembling are overmarked by stage effect, and
the tone in which he orders his myrmidons to join
him in silent prayer—“ Gentlemen, the Te Deum,
&e. ! ’ sounds very like a pompous landowner pro-
posing’ the Queen’s health at an agricultural show,
x et, in his own lurid style, Mr. Bellew is strong
as well as picturesque. Scot Inglis, as Cavara-
dossi, lends himself to Mrs. Potter’s endearments
with little (not much) more fervor than the
frigid Sass exhibited of yore. Also, he dies like a
hero, facing the file of soldiers in calm defiance,
after Mrs. P. has assured him that their muskets
are loaded with blank-cartridge. The rest of the
tragedy is spectacle, drum-roll, and faint cries of
pain from the torture-chamber.
* » » *
Ou Saturday the Princess’s puts forward an
attractive double programme in “David Garrick ”
and “ Cavalleria Rusticana,” minus the music,
the Potter-Bellew season will extend over another
ten nights, and be followed by three nights of
Trilby,” previous to Fax and Co. sailing for
Maoriland. And then Nat Goodwin, a man with
a great reputation, will take the stage with another
Murkan contingent.
** * #
The glorious uncertainty of theatrical
management is exemplified in the treasury returns
from a “ Trilby ” burlesque at Melbourne Royal.
Every night the theatre is packed, under police
supervision, and good money is despised and
rejected at the doors. The Prince of Wales doesn’t
loom in a private box, with a “ broad blue ribbon
on his breast and the British Ambassador beside
him, but, all the same, Maggie Moore can say
to herself, as manager Raw said to Madame
Svengali, “ Great house, madame, great sight ! ”
before she goes on to give them “ Ben Bolt.” The
burlesque, regarded merely as an entertainment,
reveals no reason for this state of affairs. It excites
the smallest amount of applause on record consider-
m o the number of people present. The usual causes
and indications of a great success are not to be
seen on the stage, or heard in the auditorium.
T here is no new catchy singing or dancing, bar an
altogether ” ballet by a group of well-selected
legs, nor any special merit in Edmund Finn’s
libretto, which, however, is not badly put together.
One laughs from time to time at the intermittent
parody on “Trilby” proper, and yawns when a
small child squeaks an uncalled-for ballad about
a drummer-boy, but in a general way one sits
unmoved wondering why this inexpensive show
should prosper exceedingly. It came along at the
right moment, with the right woman attached,
and the conjunction of the two names—Trilby and
Maggie Moore—did the trick. Everybody who
saw the drama feels bound to sample the bur-
lesque, whilst the residue of the population, which
has only lately learned that “ Trilby ” is somehow
connected with bare feet, seizes this opportunity
to enquire into the mystery. One boom has given
birth to another.
* * * •
The performance lasts a few minutes
longer than on the opening night, also it hangs
together more neatly and has ceased to mistrust
itself. Maggie Moore plays the name-part breezily
on her own, ” without regard for the other Trilby;
but Svengali and Gecko reproduce the originals in
a serio-comic spirit. Gecko is humorous all the
tune, because he always mimics the little man in
the drama, and Roberts, as Svengali, is equally
satisfactory as long as he sticks to an imitation of
Reuben Fax. When he aims at frivolity or tries to
warble in a light strain, the clever young actor ex-
poses the true character of his style, which is
heavy. The people disguised as Taffy, Zou Zou
and Co. lend very little assistance, but there is an
important unseen power in veteran John Wallace,
who fixed up the stage business and brought his
experienced eye to bear upon the “altogether”
legs aforesaid. “ Trilby ” will run triumphantly
for five weeks, the full limit of Miss Maggie
Moore’s season, provided that the bubble reputa-
tion doesn’t burst.

The Bijou bristled with local musicians at
Chevalier de Kontski’s first recital. The long-
haired professors, with few exceptions, had come
prepared to worship Beethoven’s pupil and friend,
but at an early period of the veteran’s first number
the intense look began to leave their faces, and
when the first bars of u S’wanee ~ were re-
cognised as the encore there was an audible gasp.
De Kontski, it must be confessed with secret satis-
faction, is not a classical player of the Halle
type, but in delicate expression, technique,
and mastery of the key-board he can shame
many of even the brilliant young pianists. His
appearance is quaint when seated at the instru-
ment crowned with a red fez, which he carefully
adjusts upon his shining scalp ere starting to make
music. And his entrance, with head erect, and a
certain majestic uncertainty of gait—bless his
dear old limbs ! —is a triumph of mind over
matter.
** * *
Chevalier de Kontski appeared at the
Bijou sundry times last week, and was such a
highly interesting artist that the voice of General
Desire implored him to give one or two extra
pianoforte playings at the Athenteum Hall. The
Chevalier, apart from all matters of controversy
m musical jargon, is an octogenarian performer
to be seen and _ heard. As regards his unusual
reading of certain classic numbers The Bulletin
will merely express profound admiration at his
being able to read them anyway out of his own
venerable head, sans spectacles.

Melbourne Bijou starts regular business
again on Saturday, under the management of Miss
Marie Luella and Cosgrove, who intend to prbduce
“Fun on the Bristol,” with the male partner in
the Widdy character and the other half of the firm
as daughter Dora. Also, they promise a well-
organised support on a scale of great magnifi-
cence.

At the Opera House the much-plagiarised
Tennyson and O’Gorman have come to support
the Frantz Family. Popular concerts at the
Town Hall are likely to continue, also a Food and
Health show will glorify the products of a bounti-
ful soil at the Exhibition Building until July 22nd.
At Poverty Point .
Theorbo : “ What stupidity for two foreign musical com-
panies to be doing the business of one ! The Thudichum
Quartette is the better, on the average, but the Trebelli
has the best star, which is much more than half the battle.
Entrepreneurs never will learn the wisdom of Signor
Oatalirii, when he said to the manager : ‘ All you want is
My Wife, and four or five puppets. ’ ”
Nowadays, it seems a forlorn hope for English concert
co/s to cry in the wilderness of Melbourne. Even the
faithful few fighting the good fight against comic opera,
a,nd that ilk, lose heart after repeated evenings spent in
listening to the quavering voices of discouraged singers
echoing and re-echoing through the deserted Town Hall.
Dear Bulletin, —Speaking of Mrs. Potter’s leg-wraps in
“ As You Like It,” you remark : “All women are knock-
kneed (says an authority-probably Solomon).” It re-
quires no authority to say it. Look' at any ballet, at any
stage-march, and life simply howls the fact aloud. Look
at any half-dozen female skeletons, and death gives silent
proof of the fact. Compare a few male skeletons with a
few female ones, and the reason is plain. The thigh-bones
of the broad-hipped woman are attached to her pelvic
hones at a much sharper angle than those of the narrow-
hipped man ; therefore, to give her body natural support,
the shin-bones also are at a sharper angle with the thigh-
bones than in man. A man’s thigh-bones are practically
parallel, but woman’s form a sort of capital Y.—Yours

“Camille” is advertised as the “Famous Society
Drama.” Why not “ Demi-Monde Romance ” ?
How “Trilby ” strikes evangelist Varley “ The move-
ments of the actors suggest a number of high-class
rational dogs, borne along bv corrupt passion. From the
prurient suggestion of the fair Trilby as the artist’s model,
until the curtain drops, the tendency of this fascinating
representation is directly towards the gilded dens in Ex-
hibition-street.” If the play affects Varley that way he
shouldn t attend the theatre. If it doesn’t affect him that
way, how does he know where the tendency leads?
Pro. : “On one Northern country trip our advance-
agent was empowered to engage an orchestra of three in
each town for which we were booked. In the
engaged flautist-was a wretched performer, and at rehear-
sal made such a mess of his music that our manager
accosted him with, ‘ See here, we don’t want you to-
night . you just drop out! ’ The flute-player arose with
much dignity and .made answer : i I’m Mayor of this
town. I’ll play to-night, or 111 cancel your permission to
use this town-hall.’ He played.”
The first “ Pointsman” crowd, in Melb., is pretty well
scattered. Maud Williamson has kept her position since,
in Australia. Clara Cowper and her husband, Calvert,
are in England, where Clynds was acting Napoleon, by
last advices, and Bucklaw is thought more of than he was
here. Frank Emery has stuck, and Polly’s Audrey is
proof of her advance.
The Australasian critic stated that Melbourne play-
goers were eager to see “The Pointsman” again, “ re-
membering, perhaps, the fine rendering of it some years
ago by the company which introduced Mr. Clynds and
Mr. bass to notice.” But Sass didn’t take part in “ The
Pointsman.” He first appeared in “ Bells of Haslemere.”
It may be said of the amateur opera co. which per-
fornied recently to excellent sitting accommodation in
Melbourne Bijou, that it has a few redeeming voices.
The giddy Earl of Yarmouth has organised a large
amateur opera co. at Mackay (Q.), and contemplates
opening towards the end of July, with “Morocco Bound,”

Is Miss “ Ida Hamilton,” of the Potter-Bellew combina-
tion, a daughter of the fair Cora? If not, the likeness is
marvellous, and an absolute proof of the theory that
persons living in close association acquire each other’s
physical characteristics. Miss Hamilton, in feature and
voice, is an exact replica of Mrs. B.P.—even that look of
innocent cunning which shines from the elder woman’s
eyes is reproduced.
Mesmerist Kennedy has appeared at an At Home at
Government-House, Sydney, with great success, but it is
not recorded that he made his wretches drink kerosene
for the edification of the very nicest people.
Mr. S. M. Ledochouski, an abnormally tall Polish
pianist, was to have performed at a Melbourne “ Lebditon
Society concert last week, but indisposition— resulting
from modesty, perhaps-kept him off the platform.
Ledochouski, who is said to be an accomplished player,
has never yet faced an audience in Melbourne, although
he has been a resident there for some time. The Lebditon
Society, if its small crowd of high-toned members care to
stick to it, may be a means of bringing such unassertive
talent into notice.
There was a genuine ring of friendship in the applaud-
ing of Titheradge when he came on to recite Farrell’s
Uied ” dt a Melbourne popular concert the
other Monday. Apparently folks in general felt that the
old favorite was unlucky in being open to a casual
engagement of the kind. Next day, it was satisfactory to
know, he left for Brisbane to join the new Brough Co
Titheradge is an actor who thinks, and looks ahead with
sadness to the time when one becomes old and drops out
of the swim. But he has many “ old” parts to play after
he ceases to play young parts.
Apropos Mary Provost’s Camille, of 40 years ago, the
Armand Duval of that day lives in quiet retirement in
Sydney, a hale old gentleman, Joseph Rayner by name.
The Chevalier de Kontski occupied “ the Old Armchair ”
at the Austral Salon, t’other afternoon. He wore a red
skullcap on his ancient head, but otherwise seemed an
attractive old gentleman. Whether owing to the fact
that the mass of the Salonites cannot appreciate
bric-a-brac, or that his proprietors for the day kept him
jealously to themselves, the Chevalier was made little fuss
over. Nevertheless, he clapped, laughed and applauded
as if he had outlived blasbism.
Kontski married his devoted wife in 1870, when he was
51 and she was 16.
Mile. Trebelli is about the first eminent visiting vocalist
who has accompanied herself on the pianoforte when
singing. This must be attributed to her desire to show
that she can play as well as sing. She is an excellent
pianiste, but it might well be asked whether the audience
ought not to be consulted as to the propriety of facing
them when singing.
The Brisbaneites have been exercised in mind over the
success of Vincent Corrigan, the boy-soprano who san«-
“ The Last Rose of Summer,” with harp accompaniment!
at a recent concert. Some of the more enthusiastic pre-
dict for the youngster a Cyril Tyler-like career.
Mme. Charbonnet-Kellerman, lately returned from
Europe, found Lady Hall 6 “looking none the worse for
her late bereavement ” (the loss of her husband). They
never do—unlessiThe old man has left them badly off—
and Neruda has just had an Italian estate presented to
her by her admirers. By the way, somebody remarks, in
“ A Trip to Chinatown,” to the effect that no woman is a
real woman until she’s a widow.
George Rignold will produce this Xmas, at Melb. Royal,
a real old-fashioned pantomime of the long, long ago type
and is importing some dozen artists specially for'lt from

Spagnoletti: “ A Montgomery, in the Melb. ‘As you
Like It” distribution, sets me musing on Walter. He
suicided (two days after his marriage) the very day Shafto
Robertson was killed by falling down the engine-room (on
the voyage from Melb. to India made under the auspices
of Mr. and Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis). Walter Montgomery, right
name Tomlinson, was a draper’s assistant at Swan and
Edgar’s, London. His Hamlet never struck any town but
Melb., where he hypnotised Michie, James Smith, Bright,
Blair, and all the Rococo, so as to lead to the famous ‘ Is
Harald IM ?’ pamphlet by a heap of contributors, with
Haddon s preface, while the other paper put up the head-
hne— Is the editor of the Argus mad?’ Montgomery’s
Hamlet was just Fechter and cream. A good actor, he
had the luck to be over-rated in England, too, because
Dillon had gone off, and Irving had not come.”
Eleonora Duse put. the Windsor Castle officials in a blue
funk by not turning up early when her troupe came for
the snow. Manager Gorlitz, Auiy Sherwin’s husband, said
it would be all right, and she came strolling by herself
through the park.
The most versatile actress ever seen on the Australian
stage is Maggie Moore. A few of her performances:
Lizzie Stofel, Little Jack Sheppard, Nan the Good-for-
Nothing-, Arrah-na-Pogue, Nellie Denver in “ Silver King ”
Josephine in “Pinafore,” and Ruth in the “Pirates” (a
soprano part followed by a contralto part); Lady Jane in
“ Patience,” and Bettina in “La Mascotte” (former con-
tralto, latter soprano). Besides these, other burlesques
and Irish dramas, and she has often danced a jig and a
hornpipe on Saturday night and sung a devotional “ Ave
Maria” on Sunday in a convaynient Catholic church
Who can beat this ?
Talking about budding divers, Fitzgeralds have been
deluged with offers from aspirants for the ill-fated Peart’s
place. Of the many, the Tasmanian champion could have
done the low dive in the tent—some 50ft.—without
danger; but the great dives in buildings were beyond any
man known so far except Peart, whose life as a sailor had
given him a contempt for heights. “ Anything that’s
damp I can dive into,’ he used to say, expressing his
wonderful knack of turning upon striking shallow water.
As Dan Fitzgerald never got over his nervousness ori
Peart s account even after the hundredth repetition, the
firm is off divers now, as the anxiety is too great. “No
divers need apply.”
H. : “ The preface of the just-issued collection of Marcus

This was at the instance of Mrs. Clarke’s sister,'Mrs. L. L.

all reference to her stage-connection. Therefore, a cool-
ness ensued between the sisters, and was never healed.
Another theatrical biography which never saw the light
was that of J. C. Lambert, in 7 vols. of MSS.
Ruined Abbey. The entrepreneur who sent Sarah Bern-
hardt to Australia is insolvent.
Hans Von Bulow, whose card bore “ Pianist to His
Majesty,” offended the Emperor, and, therefore, altered
his card to “ Pianist to His Majesty the German People.”
Cockaigne: “Much humbug is written about glorious
Mrs. Keeley, the example to the profession, and all that,
merely because she has vegetated. The saving used to be
m London that as manageress her panacea for bad busi-
ness was taking an inch off the ballet skirts. Her Jack
bheppard, now so cracked up, was styled, by the papers
of the day, a disgrace to the stage.”
Suburban domino-thumpers will be incited to further
exertions by the news that an Italian has broken the
long-distance piano-playing record by performing 46
hours without a break. Little things like this go far
towards explaining the bitterness of the vendetta.
One Melb. pro. who used to act old men 30 years ago-
now sticks to walking gentlemen.
The military drama has spread as far as Siam. In a.
recent Siamese play Queen Victoria—who reigns at Ceylon,,
the capital of England—is engaged to be married to the
King of Siam, but that monarch breaks off the match
owing to injurious reports about the queen’s character..
Victoria, in fact, is suspected of having her golden hair
a-hanging down her back and being a violent and rampant
rlossie. She invades Siam with a large army, but is
repulsed with great slaughter. The Duke of Cambridge-
covers the retreat of the shattered British forces, and
fights desperately with a battleaxe. Ultimately, the
suspicions being removed, Victoria and the King of Siam;
are married and live happily ever after.
Luckily, Gilbert and Sullivan were not present at the-
latest Hebrew charity performance of “Pinafore” ire
Smellbourne. The joy of hearing Dick Deadeve contri-
bute a yarn ” after one of the gallant seamen had inter-
polated Off to the Rio Grande,” might have been too
much for the author and composer. By the way, are these
outrages committed “by permission of Messrs. William-
son and Musgrove ” ?
Miss Thudichum, the soprano of the English Concert
Co., pronounces her awkward-looking name “Thoodi-

• Bulletin's opinion that the “ mango trick ”
is based on hypnotism coincides with that of the present

and then to close your hand on it. This done, a sort of
numbness seizes the hand, and, on being requested to
open it, the coin has, to all appearance, vanished. On
closing the hand by direction of the necromancer the
numbness ceases, and with the return of complete sensa-
t-ion you feel the rupee, and subsequently satisfy your-
self by ocular demonstration that the piece of money is
there all right. Of course, the rupee never left your

The full text of the Commercial Bank of Aus-
tralia’s reconstruction is now to hand. It is a very steep
reconstruction for all parties concerned, and an awful
commentary on the beautiful things the board has been
saying about itself for some years past. The Commercial
owes its reconstructed depositors £5,773,780, of which
nearly £5,000,000 is due before 1901. It proposes to pay
one-thirtieth (Bd. in the £), equal to £192,800, in Sept.,
'96 ; another thirtieth in Sept., ’97 ; and four instalments
of one-fifteenth each (£385,000) in 1899, 1901, 1903, and
1906. This means that, instead of paying £5,000,000 inside
five years, the Commercial will pay off about £1,928,000
(one-third of its reconstructed deposits) in 10 years. The
interest on the unpaid instalments is to be 3 per cent, up
to 1899, and thereafter 3£ per cent. The other two-thirds
of the deposits (about £3,840,000) are to be extended in-
definitely at 3 per cent. Their repayment depends on the
realisation of the locked-up assets of the old boom-bank,
so they may be wiped off in 10 years or a century. The
preference capital (£2,115,320) is to have priority up to 4
per cent, instead of five, as at present, but the bank abso-
lutely guarantees to pay 2 per cent, for the first three
years and 3) per cent, afterwards, and arrears are to be
cumulative. The complicated position is therefore some-
what as follows: —The Commercial, in 1897, will save
about 190,000 in deposit-interest, and lose £42,306 through
hai ing to provide 2 per cent, on preference shares which
now get nothing at all. In 1899 it will save about £lOO,OOO
in interest on deposits and lose about £74,000 through
having to provide 3£ per cent, dividends on preference
shares. After 1901 the saving increases somewhat, but
it floesn’t seem to average much over £35,000 a year,
which looks none too large to cover the steady falling
away in the profits, and not near large enough to build
up a reserve-fund and give the ordinary shareholders
any show. Certainly it, amounts to some relief, but not
nearly so much as was anticipated, and possibly not so
much as is required.
* * * *
In addition to all this ,£1,200,000 of the ordinary
capital is to be written off to cover losses on the old bank’s
petrified assets. This is the whole of the shareholders’
original capital, and, with the reserve-fund already
written off, makes their losses over £2,200,000_. Whether
this new sacrifice is sufficient to cover everything it is im-
possible to tell, but if any inference can be drawn from
the very small amount of interest apparently derived from
the old assets, it doesn’t seem likely to leave much
margin. The capital of the ordinary shareholders is thus
reduced to £689,000, so they have a very small interest in
the bank compared to the preference crowd. The old
assets, when written down by this £1,200,000 will be
nominally valued at £4,951,000. They are to be formed
into an allegedly separate Assets Co., but as this won’t
alter the bank’s liability in the least, or make the assets
any better, the only apparent object is to take the grue-
some item out of the balance-sheet. The £3,840,000 of
deposits, not definitely provided for above, are to be paid
off by instalments, as the assets are realised, when-
ever that may be. Calls are to fall due half-yearly in-
stead of quarterly. The preference shareholders are
practically to boss the bank in future, so the old pro-
prietors may almost be said to have lost their bank alto-
gether.
The reconstruction looks very unpromising in
one respect. The Commercial binds itself to pay off
nearly £2,000,000 of old deposits in ten years, and it can’t
use any of the old assets for the purpose —these, to the
alleged value of £4,951,000, are to be set aside for the
security of £3,840,000 of interminable deposits—and how
the bank will wrestle with this difficulty it is impossible to
say. Further, the Commercial, like the Royal and
Colonial, has hitherto alleged that it can’t write off lost
capital until a new Companies Act is passed, and as the
Act may not pass the promise to write off £1,200,000
looks rather reckless. Possibly the theory about the
necessity of waiting for a new Act hasn’t much in it. The
present law, it is true, doesn’t specifically authorise the
writing-off of lost capital, but neither does it specifically
prohibit it. Therefore it is an open question whether
there is any real necessity for waiting. The law doesn’t
authorise a bank to buy its own shares or the directors to
grant the manager an overdraft, yet both these things are
done simply because they are not prohibited. Possibly
the question of writing off lost capital comes into the
same category.

The report of the Mutual Life Insurance Co. of
New York for 1895 shows that the year’s premium-income
reached the stupendous sum of £7,910,650, and the in-
come from interest on investments was £2,068,288, making
the total receipts £9,978,938. Death and endowment
claims and working - expenses of all kinds came to
£6,884,577, and the total additions to the funds were
£3,403,477. The accumulated assets of the Mutual of
New York are now £45,423,762, and the surplus over all
liabilities is £5,516,748. The surplus is nearly £900,000
larger than it was a year ago, so the Mutual of New York
keeps increasing its already very large margin to cover
possible depreciation in securities and unforeseen disasters
of all sorts, and to provide future dividends. The assets
include £21,000,000 in State and other first-class securi-
ties, £14,000,000 in mortgages, &c., £4,500,000 in lands and
buildings, and £2,500,000 in cash on deposit. The sound-
ness of the co. and the security of its investments and the
solid reality of its big surplus are all certified by the State
auditor as well as by the auditors of the co.

The State Fire Insurance Bill has come before
Maoriland Parliament, and, if the cabled summary is
correct, it is a bold and tolerably well-conceived measure.
It works on the Local Option principle. A majority vote
of the ratepayers in any borough or county places the
district under the provisions of the Act. Then all pro-
perty in the district—-except any that may be too
dangerous for insurance—is compulsorily insured in the
Government Department, and the private companies, as
soon as their current risks expire, go right out. The
compulsory system means, of course, that the large out-
lay for commission, which, in most cases, absorbs from
one-fifth to one-eighth of the premium income, will be
saved. In other words, if the income amounts to £lOO,OOO
a year the saving on this item should be from £12,000 to
£20,000. If the scheme is universally adopted there will
also be a saving to the country by the expulsion of the
foreign offices which take away a considerable amount
annually in profits. Part of the surplus profits are to go
to a reserve-fund, and the remainder will be returned as
bonuses to insurers. With no commission to pay at one
end and no dividends to shareholders at the other, the
profits, under moderately good management, should be
large, even though premiums be reduced considerably.
The enterprise is to start with a capital of £250,000 raised
by loan —where raised is not stated, though if the Seddon
Government proposes living up to its principles the loan
certainly should be negotiated locally. Assuming that
the Fire Insurance Bili gets through the Council, it will
be about the most interesting experiment in State Social-
ism up to date.

Queensland finishes the financial year with a
surplus, more or less reliable, of £73,636. The figures for
N.S. Wales are not known, Treasurer Reid having so far
refused to publish them. Victoria shows a deficit, as far
as appears yet, of £4200 on the actual year’s business,
whereas Premier Turner reckoned on a surplus large
enough to enable him to pay off £250,000 of Shiels’s
ancient shortage. A rich man pegged out just in time to
pay £ll,OOO probate duty a few days before the year
closed, else the shortage would have been much larger,
and if another rich man had died there might.have been a
surplus. Maoriland has a surplus for the year of £28,000,
not reckoning the £145,400 taken from the sinking-fund
byTreas. Ward, which transaction is surrounded by so
much mist in some places that it is difficult to say how
much of the £145,400 should be reckoned as surplus.
Anyhow, the £28,000 seems absolutely genuine.

Levien, M.L.A., declares emphatically before
the Mildura Commission that it was not doing business on
insufficient capital which wrecked the Chaffey co. What
was it, then ? The co. started with less than £45,000
actual capital. Therefore, it had to raise £114,000 on de-
bentures at an actual rate of 6| per cent., and borrow
from the Colonial Mutual at 10 per cent., and elsewhere at
rates which, including 5 per cent, for a guarantee, ran as
high as 14 per cent. It blewed £27,500 per annum in
interest and miscellaneous expenses attached to floating
loans, to keep something like £220,000 of indebtedness
afloat. If it had started with £300,000 capital, which
would have been sufficient for all purposes, it need not
have borrowed at all; and it could have paid 5 per cent,
dividends and yet been £14,000 a year better off. And
that £14,000 a year would have saved it under anything
like decent management. If it wouldn’t, then it could
have suspended dividends and saved 127,500 a year,
whereas interest couldn’t be suspended. What does
Levien imagine it was that wrecked the Chaffey enter-
prise, if it was not insufficient capital and the consequent
expenditure of £121,000 in interest, &c., on borrowed
money ?

A great deal is heard now-a-days about the
cheapness of money for mortgage purposes, but the re-
duction is mostly in the towns. The fanner who wants to
borrow on agricultural property pays much the same
rates as before. For example, the Mildura settlers who
are mortgaged to the Colonial Mutual Society are liable
for l'O per cent, interest; but, where the settler proves
that he can’t pay the 10 per cent., the society has reduced
the interest, sometimes as low as 6 per cent. Those who
can pay more presumably do so. A State Land Bank
could do the whole business at 5 per cent., and make a
good profit out of it.

The working-expenses of the Maoriland State
Loan Department for 12 months were £9395 —about
13s. 4d. per cent, on the money in hand. Putting
the expenses at 15s per cent., and assuming the
capital is raised at 31, this means that it costs the State 4
per cent, for interest and expenses. If the money is lent
out at 5 per cent., there remains a very large margin for
possible losses

That big reconstructed concern, Goldsbrough,
Mort and Co., Limited, issues a balance-sheet which shows
that the net profits for the past nine months, after paying
reconstruction expenses and interest on the £2,725,750 of
debentures which weigh down, the institution, were just
£315 7s. Id. This, on £820,000 of capital, is equal to about
one shilling per cent, per annum. Ttie reconstruction
expenses, of course, reduced the profits considerably, and
the past year has been a bad one, but still the outlook
doesn’t seem very brilliant-—for the ordinary shareholders
especially. The policy of working on £822,000 of capital
and 2J millions of borrowed money doesn’t appear to
answer any too well.

happened after Id. per lb. was taken off in January.
There is no evidence that Freetrade sent butter up ; the
ill-luck of the Government lies in the fact that it was pro-
bably going up in any case and Freetrade could do nothing
to keep it down.

It is reported that the Ghirnside estate (Vic.) is
valued for land-tax purposes at £2 an acre. Yet when
Melb. Board of Works bought a piece recently for a sewage
farm the price paid for it was £l3 Ids. per acre admittedly
a tolerably fair valuation. This is a truly awful dis-
crepancy, yet there is apparently no legal process by
which the State can make Chirnside sell land which is
wanted for State purposes at £2, or make him pay tax on
£l3 10s., or recover all that it has lost in the past by him
paying tax on less than one-sixth of the value of his pro-
perty, or by which it can get at the public servant who
lets Chirnside off five-sixths of his tax on a charge of
gross and unspeakable incompetence. The Vic. land-tax
produces about £120,000 a year, and if this is a fair example
of how it is levied it ought to produce at least £400,000
more—which would square the deficit beautifully. Evi-
dently this is where the deficit comes in.

The opening of a grocery branch by Lassetters,
the big Sydney ironmongers, marks the trend of the
times. The big men are eating the little men, and the
big man dependent on one line of goods knocks under to
the man with half-a-dozen lines —or a dozen, or a score.
You cannot live on one line alone, nowadays—not in the
first rank, anyway. It pays the Anthony Horderns of the
storekeeping community to sell lots of little articles at a
loss, in order to bring, customers to the big articles ; or
even to make a deliberate loss on a whole department,
such as patent medicines, or gloves, or fancy goods, in
order to cut the ground from under competitors.
Not so long ago, for example, a man made
a £lOO purchase of tinned meats from one of the meat
co’s, and came into the city prepared, as he fondly
imagined, to do good trade. What was his astonish-
ment to find one of the universal providers selling by
retail those very goods at a lower price than he had
paid wholesale! Back he went to the meat co.’s
manager. “Weil, it’s this way,” said that individual, “ I
don’t deny you’re a good customer, but Blank” —men-
tioning the universal provider’s representative—“ comes
to me and planks down a cheque for £6OO, and says,
‘ Gimme meat for that,’ and,'of course, I have to cut him
a bit lower* But he’s selling it for actually less than he
paid me —says he’s going to get the trade if he has to
give the tins away.” And the comparatively-small cus-
tomer went away enlightened.

Wagga district wheat-growers are growling at the large

Yankee wheat in Sydney and pay the railway-freight on
it to Wagga for the latter sum.

Melbourne hotelkeepers who have sold out of
their houses, but whose licenses have not been trans-
ferred, have a grievance. Under a section of the Licensing
Act, until the' license is absolutely transferred the old
tenant is responsible for all breaches of the Act by the
new tenant. Thus a man may have sold out and given up
possession, yet the law holds him responsible until after
the decision of the licensing court. In one case recently
a new tenant failed to cancel a beer-stamp ; the authori-
ties proceeded against the old licensee, who was 50 miles
away at the time, and fined him heavily. However, there
seems no way out of this difficulty. The law must father
the responsibility upon some tangible person.

The fate of the Vic. Credit Foncier proposals,

It is represented in the South that everything is
booming in the sugar-districts. As a matter of fact, things
are quite the reverse. Wages are lower than ever, and
employment scarce. There were thirty applications for
the secretaryship of the Bundaberg Harbor Board (£l5O

board’s business. And the position was regarded as of
such importance that the “ leading ” local newspaper
actually published a biography of the successful appli-

Respectable Murray Smith considers that the

Smith and Fink predict that Victoria will cease to possess
any limited companies whatsoever as soon as balance-
sheets begin to throw light upon their business. Financial
institutions are doomed. No more bogus land-dealings,
no more robbing of many depositors to feed directors
elans, no more busted boomsters paying ninepence in the
£, no more sham Crown prosecutions —glorious possibility !
By all means let Vic. Assembly hasten the wreck of these
rotten concerns that can’t afford to show where they make

Vic. country storekeepers in localities adjacent
to village settlements have lost heavily by the flitting of
settlers. Credit, in most instances, was given on the
assumption that Govt, wasn’t likely to let the experiment
of dumping the people on the land prove a failure. The
settlers finding, in many instances, that an allotment
with a top-soil of 3in. (the subsoil granite) wouldn’t grow
enough to feed a goat, quickly emigrated back to town.
The storekeepers have badgered Govt, to pay up, but
Premier Turner reckons the State has no responsibility in
the matter. Result —Flinders Lane busy with ss. in the £

to make further reductions, and they adhere to their re-
solution to have individual agreements, while saying they
don’t mean to assail the unions. At time of writing the

The lengthy action brought by the Alliance and
Liberty companies (London) against Adolphe Russell (re-
presenting a syndicate of Melbourne Frenchmen) for ful-
filment of agreements to sell- certain Coolgardie mining
leases, was enlivened by the reading of some artless letters
and telegrams from Russell to his agent in Westralia.
One telegram said : “ Can you recommend an impartial
engineer to report. London requires. Get a good one on
whom you can rely. Arrange with him for good result.”
Russell explained that by stipulating for a good result he
meant that the expert must make the report “ properly.”
Another telegram said : “Matthews is chosen (to report).
Everything depends on him. Give attention. Act dis-
creetly. Success depends on it.” Here the discreet
Frenchman explained that the word “it” meant “the
result ” and not “ success.” But the idea of a man tele-
graphing the obvious fact that success depended on the
result was altogether too steep forjudge Hodges, so at
this stage of the proceedings his Honor threatened to re-
commend witness Russell for a perjury prosecution.
Another telegram followed next day : “ Grease his palm.
Urge him to succeed, and push the report on as promptly
as possible.” All of which seems rather unlikely to revive
Hinglish confidence in Australian mining specs., presum-
ing, of course, that a full report of the case crosses the
deep blue sea. In the interests of business it might be
as well for the Anglo-Australian brotherhood of mine-
floaters to hold a meeting, and pass resolutions of bitter
scorn for the French “fly flat” who sent “grease his
palm ” through the public telegraph-office.

Extract from aW. A. letter : “ This enterprising
man asked me if I wanted to make £lOO, and, being
willing, I was introduced as the representative of Mel-
bourne Arous (which, of course, I wasn’t). This caused
great consternation in the army of mining-agents here,
whose one aim is to boom the place. I hinted that a
scathing article would probably appear in about 14 days.
This was a terrible blow, as some of them are more-or-!ess
responsible for the gilded accounts you read at breakfast
in the Eastern dailies. One man, who is said (by himself)
to write for London Truth, implored me to let the mines
down lightly —at any rate, not to say anything till he got
clear of a few things he had in hand. There was a whis-
pered conversation, and my enterprising friend came to
me and said I could get 150, and, with a knowing wink,
told me to hold out. He soon came back with an offer of
£loo—the report to be submitted for perusal before the
money was paid. I have the matter under consideration.”

Writes a N.S.W. mining man from Coolgardie :
“ I am pleased The Bulletin admits that some good
mines have been opened up around Hannan’s. There are
a few other good ones outside Hannan’s amongst in-
numerable wild-cats. Burbank’s is not bad. It has had
one big crushing, but I am satisfied the mine is by no
means exhausted. The Lady Loch is a fine show. No
one seems to know what the crushing went, but, from
what I have seen of the stone, it must have gone 4oz. It
has, I should think, 1000 tons at grass, and the mine looks
well. Then comes the Australasia (one of Dr. Simon’s

lam a mug. There are some good mines at Menzies,
though some of the veins have very much pinched with
depth. In the Lady Sherry and Lady Shenton they are
working.fairly large reefs, and you would be safe in bet-
ting the stone is worth ounces. As a line of reef I like
this one most of all. I think the Black Flag district will
turn out mines, but as I am interested there I will say no
more. There are few buyers about —so many ‘ cats ’ have
been traded off that it is rather difficult to get even a
decent show looked at.”

The call of Cd. on the Victory mine, Charters
Towers, amounts to £4OOO. That is mining. The sum
provided by this one call is ten times the working-capital
provided for a Cobar mine lately floated and now tipped
ad nauseam to numbers of alleged correspondents every
Sunday. The reasons given for the coming boom in this
Cobar mine are indisputable—“ it is only some 800 yards
from Barrass and Conley’s famous mine. YVe need say no
more.” YVhich is quite enough to make any man who has
seen a mine outside of a photo, feel tired.

Almost the first act of the British syndicate
which has bought up the bulk of the Reefton (M.L.) gold-

Apropos of the recent Bulletin woman-
doctor controversy, it is related that one of the
cleverest, judging by her British qualifications, of
the professional women now practising in Austra-
lia applied recently for the inedical-officership of a
women’s benefit society. There are 120 members
in the lodge, of whom 110 are single. The medico
received, in reply to her application, a courteous
communication intimating that, “as the majority
of members had been accustomed to gentlemen
doctors, it would be of no use pressing the appli-
cation. Just so ! The principal adversary of
the woman-doctor is the woman who, perhaps all
unknown to herself, is influenced by the subtle
sex-instinct.

The Sydney Theosophists have forged a
bolt which, if properly directed, should have prac-
tical effect on local opinion re cremation. The
argument, which is to be supported by petition, is in
the mam that inasmuch as the State grants burial-
grounds worth in the aggregate scores of thousands
annually to the religious denominations which
believe in burial, it should grant to the Theoso-
phists .who believe in cremation a lump sum of
<£3ooo or £4OOO for the construction of a crema-

S.M. Herald, in its leader columns, has
referred to marriages as “ a matrimonial experi-

C. E.: “ Duck-shot .”
B.: “ Try rum! ”

new literature staid subscribers will be some day

both birth and death are mere experiments.

The Sec. of the Yic. Temperance Alliance
implores the local Government not to assist the

“ the country population of Victoria becomes a

Says St. Dunstan :
It is surely a libel on Australian manhood to suggest
that we cannot spend an evening without our pipes.
There is no such suggestion, except in the in-
ventive faculty of St. Dunstan. The C. of E.
parsons referred to merely say : “You may spend
an evening with us and with your pipes.” Evi-
dently the Dunstan supply of salvation is not on

be both interesting and amusing. On his first voyage out
from ’Frisco or Vancouver, the Kanuck is a blatant and
super-loyal subject of H.b.m. He resents with in-
dignation the innocent and natural assumption of
his Australian fellow - voyagers that he must be a
Yankee because he hai'ls from some part of the
American continent and possesses a more or less powerlul

of ’Murkan accent, derived from his aggressive and
numerous neighbor at home, he quietly accepts the
character thrust on him. He soon learns to drop in for a
chat at the U.S. consulate, more or less skilfully evading

Two white girls, aged nine and eleven re-
spectively, were brought before Bundaberg (Q.)
Bench the other day as neglected children. They
were found in a Chinese den, and the evidence
showed that they had been violated by kanaka
visitors to that domicile. The Bench (without
comment, of course) sent them to a reformatory,
and the local Fat-Man press ignored the incident.
**. » *
Five Christianised kanakas (Gala islan-
ders) lately deported from Bundaberg by Govt.,
and sent home to their island, after having been
committed for trial for the murder of a Malayta
“boy,” made a piteous appeal, through the local
Inspector of Polynesians, to be permitted to take
their Bibles to their native shore. The Govt., which
found no true bill against these prisoners, deemed
it necessary to send them home to save them from
the vengeance of the Malaytans. The “faithful ”
amongst the local planters have not supplied the
boys with Bibles, and it is to be feared the mur-
derers will have to face the horrors of home with-
out the refining influence of the Word.
* * * *
A little while ago some kanakas at Bingera
plantation, near Bundaberg (Q.), were arrested
and fined for assaulting two female Syrian hawkers.
The women had visited the plantation on their
business, and were refused accommodation for the
night by the proprietors (who run a store them-
selves, and dislike visiting hawkers). Three
kanakas offered to show them a short cut to the
nearest township, and attempted to indecently
assault them in the sugar-cane. Hearing a
vehicle approaching the kanakas fled with all the
hawkers’ property —subsequently found in their
possession. The planters represented the hawkers
as a nuisance (which they undoubtedly are—
especially when competing with a plantation store),
and consequently the kanakas were let off with a
fine !! ! The kanakas, however, are not satisfied
at the result, and the other day a number of them
met some Syrian women in Bundaberg and set
upon them, but the women foufht bravely and
held them at bay until assistance arrived." The
quarrel between the Polynesians and Syrians is
therefore a very pretty quarrel as it stands and
developulents wi n be watched with interest ’ '

With images of barmaids bold ;

The image of her dearest friend.

The maiden, sneering, made reply—

Sydney’s Mayoress, Mrs. Ives, has headed
a squad of ladies enrolled as an auxiliary branch
of the Aborigines’ Protection Association, and the
main idea put forth at the initial meeting was
that efforts should be put forth to Christianise the
full-blooded real black, and not merely the half-
caste. “ Paddy Swift, converted aboriginal,” then
exclaimed words to this effect : “My word !
when mine feller countrymen, cobbone blaekfeller,
baal half-caste, catch him Christianity, him never
let that feller yan.” Very likely not, if “catching
him ” is'shown to mean blanket, ’bacca, and tucker.

mercy, to say nothing of darker stories of ravish-
ment and murder. The clergy had better hold on
to the piebald missions, as yet.

about to pass from this world by process of law

amenities are a true test of that fine old school of
official politeness which still survives in certain
quarters, and did not expire with ex-Chief-Justice
Stephen.
A Talk with Robert Brough.
[For The Bulletin.]
From Brough and Boucicault take one away—and
Brough remains. He is a Londoner, born on the
stage, of the stage, for the stage. Note the family
talent: Miss Romer, his mother, whose rare “ old
women ” never received half enough credit from
the Australian press; the opera-singer Tom Romer,
and Miss E. Romer; his clever father, Robert
Brough; William Brough, writer for the stage ;
Lionel Brough. Brough became an actor at 15.
* * * ♦
He was still young when, one Sunday morning
in Dublin, Cellini, professor of music and singing,
rang his door-bell. “ What cam this chap want
with me ? ” wondered Brough. Cellini explained
that he was going to have a benefit and wanted a
Belcore for ‘ ‘ L’Elisir d’Amore. ” “ Well ? ” queried
Brough, who didn’t know a note of music or a
word of Italian. “ Veil,” continued Cellini, “ our
friend Mistare Richhrd Burton, he say to me,
Mistare Brofe he do play Caliban, Hecate, sing-
ing parts, beauteeful! he do play Belcore splen-
dide ! ” Brough saw the game of Dicky 8.,
brother actor and Irish practical joker, and, to get
even, he took the signor oil, and after five rehear-
sals made his debut in Italian opera, amid the
thundering welcome of a crowded house. Every-
one was delighted ; Cellini joyously delirious ; and
William Wilde, the critic (brother to Oscar), said
“ the feature of the performance was the marvellous
knowledge of Italian exhibited by Mr. Robert
Brough.”
* * * *
That Dublin joke began Brough’s prosperous
London career ; soon he got a long engagement at
the Opera Coroique ; did three years, in big parts,
at the Gaiety ; splashed brilliantly ; shone with
the stars to their advantage and his. Then
his health began to be not-good, and he
came to Australia. His first part was
the Lord High Chancellor, in “lolanthe,”
at Melbourne. No reception could have been
more cordial; no applause more hearty than
the performers received as the opera swung along.
But at the curtain’s fall not a hand clapped !
“ A failure, after all,” ejaculated Brough. “ No,
no, a great success,” said somoene—“Australians
don’t call for actors and authors like Londoners ;
when the curtain falls they go home to bed.”
* * * *
“ Plays still influence people,” says Brough.
“ After ‘Tanqueray,’ in Sydney and Melb,, we had
many letters from men who owned to naughty
suburban villas and promised to reform.” (N.B. —
Brough guarantees the letters; not the reform.)
“ One solemn M.L. paper drew this sermon from
‘ Dandy Dick ’: ‘lt inculcates a beautiful moral,
exposes the evils of falsehood, betting and racing.’
Two thinkers gave me their opinion on ‘ Little
Jack Sheppard’: ‘ All rot. Singing and dancing
in gaol!—utter rot.’ They asked for farce, and
wanted—what did they want ?
* * * *
“ People often put themselves on friendly terms
with me without waiting for introduction. In
Brisbane a gentlemanly man staying at a good
hotel near mine asked me one day to have lunch
with him. I accepted and spent a pleasant hour.
A couple of weeks after, that hotel’s landlord
came over to me and said : ‘ I think you ought to
pay this bill for <£3o, Mr. Brough ; your brother
has gone away suddenly.’ ‘My brother ? ’ ‘ Yes,
your brother —you came to lunch with him one

day; lie was always talking about you.’ ‘Well,
if that makes him my brother,’ I replied, ‘you
come and have lunch With me and I’ll talk about
you; then you’ll be brother to both of us and can
pay both our bills.’ The landlord never got ,his
money ; but ‘my brother ’ got six months.
*♦* ' *
“ Another time, after an illness, I was break-
fasting at Goulburn railway-station and noticed a
mail opposite watching me intently. Presently,
finishing his coffee, he asked—‘’Ow are you, sir ? ’
‘ Convalescent, thank you,’ I said. ‘ Mean you’re
gettin’ round on your pins agen alright,’ ‘That’s
it.’ ‘ I knowed you would, sir. We had.a bet
about you up in Brisbane. There was a report
you was dead. ‘ Wot, ’ I sez, when they read it but
of the paper, ‘ Brough the actor bloke—7m dead !
’im I seen ’oppin about as Jonathan Wilde. I
can’t stand ’ im bein’ dead ; no, ’e ain’t .dead. I
lay 6 to 4 he ain’t dead.’ They takes me, sir,
and bloo me if the news don’t come along that
you’re better. I fell on my feet that time,
bookin’ a dead ’un. Well, after that, hews comes
that Alec. Robertson’s killed off Silvermine.
‘ Not me,’ I says, ‘ not me ; I lay. 6 .to 4 the old
judge ain’t dead.’ They takes me, sir, but I was
on a wrong ’un that time. ’ .
* * * * '
“Every day we get a letter or call from someone
anxious to go on the stage—mostly young people,
but a fair dash of ancients. All convinced that
the boards are the royal road to fame and wealth.
One sixteen-year-old wrote us that she would take
any of Mrs. Brough’s parts on a moment’s notice.”
*** . #
“ Every character I have played has been sug-
gested to me by people I have met, and sometimes
fits a person I have never met. When I played
‘ The Magistrate ’ in Melbourne my representation
was supposed to copy a well-known Melb. magis-
trate whom I had never seen. When I played
Dr. Gunn (‘ The Balloon ’) in Sydney people re-
marked, ‘lt’s a shame to copy Dr. so mi-
nutely, not only in his manner and walk and way
of speaking, but even in his peculiar habit of cross-
ing his knees.’ And I had never heard of that
doctor.
* * * *
“ There is no tonic like a part and an audience.
I sometimes go to the theatre at night with a
head-ache, worn-out, dreary. The footlights flash
—l’m well! When Mrs. Brough had influenza in
Melbourne she got out of bed each night to play
in ‘Devotion’—played, came home as she had
gone (in a cab), and went to bed again until next
night.
• * * *
“ Nobody ever tried to mash me after seeing me
on the stage. Solemnly, never! Mashing honors
belong to a Romeo or a Hamlet—and their imagi-
nations. My ‘old man’ parts don’t strike ’em
that way,”
* * * *
Brough has had 250 plays sent him by Australian
authors. Of these, 200 were worthless ; the rest
had more merit, but not enough to make a play.
About 50 of the plays were women’s; the worst of
all was an Australian editor’s.

And Jack-at-sea is “ saved ” complete,
And ev’rything’s “ de rigger I ”
And ev’ry future ship Bull builds
Will join the Holy Roman Guilds
With Masses sung with vigor;

And meekly kiss the Pope his toe,

The galled jade winces badly in the Age last
week, apropos of legal reform. The trail of the
Speight is over the Syme. It was, perhaps, ques-
tionable taste, however, to single out as the typical
one of barristerial malignancies the case of
Speight’s counsel in one of the jury trials, especially
when we remember that Syme’s own counsel was
named Purves. However, allowing for the per-
sonal equation, the tenor of the protest was to the
point.
The suicide of Michael Angelo Montea-
gresti, of Raymond Terrace, in consequence,
apparently, of an accumulation of counts against
him for alleged banking irregularities, should have
the effect of abridging the latitude of law officers in
this respect. What should fall under one count is
often so divided and subdivided by ingenious pro-
secutors that escape from one mes.i only lets an
accused person into another, until prosecution
absolutely becomes persecution. English Judges
invariably set their faces against attempts to
multiply counts.
Sydney’s Nicest of the Nice were to have
opened their club premises at Kensington on July
1, but as the place wasn't furnished the function
was declared off. The club-house consists of two
small houses knocked into one. The walls inside
have been kalsomined in pink, and the place has
about 12 rooms. The club wanted another house,
a pretty bijou residence, but they objected to pay
•£2OO per annum rent.
The last heard about Kanakaland and the
Federal Convention Bill was Premier Nelson’s
declaration that he “ wouldn’t waste the time of
Parliament over the matter, as there were more
important bills in connection with Queensland.
The discussion would be adjourned for a week.”
When Premier Nelson comes to die in the odor of
whisky and sanctity (they made him a Presby-
terian church elder the other day, so he’s evidently
getting ready), it will be a blessed reflection to him
that he played Mrs. Partington even for a week.
A Continental correspondent to The Bul-
letin
Dr. Fiaschi has gone to Zanzibar on board the Italian
man-o’-war, Voltunio. The ship’s doctor had fallen ill,
and the captain of the Voltunio persuaded Dr. F. to take
his place. Fighting in Abyssinia was over at the time,
and the doctor, anxious for adventure, took the billet.
They were to land at several places on the Somali Coast,
and everything pointed to a few hostile encounters with
the natives. The Voltunio was to have reached Zanzibar
on 20th inst. Dr. Fiaschi returns thence to Massowah
per the mail-boat. As the Italian Government is sending
a great number of troops back to Italy, the fighting being
over, there is a probability that Dr. F. will come on to
Italy, and, after visiting his people, will proceed to Aus-
tralia via England and America.
That eccentric gentleman, Rev. James
Clarke,, was fined £2 at Paddington (Sydney) last
Friday for alleged riotous behavior. * The case
took three days. A policeman swore that the rev.
gentleman was under the influence of liquor at
the time, and that two lemonade-bottles, one
holding rum, were found in his pocket. Mr.
Clarke said he bought this as medicine. In evi-
dence a constable said that Mr. Clarke stood in
front of a poultry-shop, brandishing a stick in one
hand and a saveloy in the other. “ I can prove,
your Worship,” said the unfortunate parson,
turning to the Bench, “that that man’s a liar : it
was a ham-and-chicken sausage.”
Melbourne Argus came a cropper over
a report in connection with the Government
House ball. Somebody lured it into publish-
ing a statement that the Brasseys intended
to paralyse sassiety with a “ musical ride on
bicycles,” headed by the vice-regal mariner and
suite. Details as to the stage management of this
new variety-show were omitted, but the Argus
strengthened the yarn by adding a list of local
persons who had, seemingly, been invited to swell
the triumph of Brassey’s sprint. Next morning
the organ of Ereetrade pealed forth an ab-
ject avowal of gullibility : “We are requested
to state that there never was any foundation for
the report which reached us that a bicycle, ride
would be introduced at the next Government
House ball.” But, all the same, The Bulletin
hears that the Argus paragraph was founded on
solemn fact—that the cycle act in question was
actually rehearsed, and that the sole inaccuracy in
the paragraph was the date. Guvmentouse was
“wild ” at its absurd little game being given away
out of season.
A Wairarapa incident. A married man—
say, Jolson—had come from M.L. some months
before the wreck in connection with an Australian
mining matter. Finding it impossible to return
within the time allowed by his ticket, he sold it.
The buyer travelled under Jolson’s name on the
Wairarapa and was drowned. Jolson at first
meant to cable his wife and family explaining ;
but, on reflection, he concluded to get rid of
family responsibilities, and made a bee-line for his
long-unvisited English home, where he wept on
the neck of his wealthy old father, who duly killed
the fatted calf. But unfortunately for Jolson, his
wife in M.L. wrote to the aged parent explaining
that his son, who was her husband, had been
drowned, and asking for help. Thereupon the old
man charged Jolson with being an impostor. This
J. denied. Then the supposed wife was written
to, and asked to forward proof that her dead hus-
band was the right Jolson. This she did by send-
idg his photo, and several letters and belongings.
Jolson’s father was satisfied, provided handsomely
for the wife and children, and dumped the sup-
posed impostor on to the cold charity of this
callous world. Jolson has now reached M.L.
and tries his best to explain to his better-half that
he is her own Jolson, after all, and that he was
only playing a little trick with her, but she alleges
that her husband was above such practices, and
that, although he resembles him, he is not him.
Hence the cunning Jolson “ dunno where ’e are.” ’

The most remarkable point about the sale
of solicitor S. G. Pirani’s fine library in Melbourne
last week was that Oscar Wilde J s poems, original
edition, numbered and with the author’s autograph
inside, only fetched 16s. The book is really very
rare, and some of Oscar’s verse is finely exotic and
erotic.
According to Postmaster-General Cook, a
postage of id. on each newspaper posted in
N.S.W. for delivery within N.S.W. would yield a
revenue of .£42,000 a year. That amount, there-
fore, represents the “Protectionism” which the
conscience of the “Freetrade organs” is agree-
able to swallow for its own personal benefit.
Years ago it was charged against Premier
Parkes that he had bought at State expense, for
his official apartments at N.S.W. Colonial Secre-
tary’s office, a bed costing £l4O. Now it is alleged
that one of the members of the God-fearing Reid
Ministry has struck the Treasury for a £24 pair of
window-curtains for his official quarters. A £24
pair of window-curtains ought to be quite big
enough to hide a pretty woman.
A certain well-known Australian book-firm
has a conscience that acts as fighting-lieutenant to
the firm’s purse. A little while ago they sup-
pressed a book, in their circulating-library called
“ Corruption,” by Percy White, and caused the
fact of their virtue in suppressing this book to be
noised abroad. They did not, however, suppress
it in their sale-branch. Curiosity being whetted,
there was a brisk demand for the work at the sale-
counter. “ Virtue rewarded.”
The fact that N.S.W. Public Service Board
was able to reduce the annual post-and-telegraph
dept, vote by nearly £52,000 — to abolish a whole
branch, amalgamate others, and dispense with 204
officers—recalls that this was the “ Appint
Maloney ” department and happy shunting-ground
of political refuse. The next and most important
retrenchment desirable is a political one—the
abolition of the portfolio of P.M.G. and the saving
of his “ screw.”
Mr. Charles Befcliune, of Melb., has struck
the keynote . of. the only permanent commercial
success. He has solved the problem of bring-

man who can supply that want —the Parnassus of
the competitive trader. As director of the Don
Cash Trading Company he has brought into direct
touch with his vast emporium at Collingwood
(Melb.) the pearl-divers of Torres Straits, the
miners of Croydon (Q.) and of Westralia, the
stock-keepers of the Far West, and the town-
dwellers of the Eastern seaboard of Australia
generally. In current issue this enterprising com-
pany begins a series of its unique advertisements,
which readers of The Bulletin far and near are

The Smith Premier typewriter is an in-
valuable machine because it adapts itself with
ease and celerity to every possible contingency.
Invented six years ago, it has most successfully
breasted the world’s competition, and forced its
way by sheer merit into public favor; since ’9O, over
60,000 machines have been sold ; 15,000 were sold
last year. These figures are comparatively all the
larger since the machine has been confined solely
to the American and Australian markets. The
Sydney Daily Telegraph News Co. Ltd. says :
“We are in every way satisfied with the seven
Smith Premier typewriters.” The machines are
also used in the Sydney G.F.0., the Mint, Equity
Court, Justice I)ept., other Govt. Depts., and
Govt. House, lor whole and sectional excellence

broken by accident, that part can be replaced,
and the machine is whole again. Points : solid

to their advantage to send their opal direct to

ing extending over a period of 40 years, which is
a sufficient guarantee to consignors that they will
be honorably treated. H. Newman is also a

From Pearson’s Weekly, April 11, 1896 :
The South Australian railways have perfected a system
for supplying current for lighting their cars by meaps of a
dynamo run from the car axle. Throughout the day this
dynamo stores up energy in accumulator cells which is
employed at night time to illuminate the train.
A strange mistake, considering that railways are
unknown in S.A. Perhaps our London contem-
porary will be surprised to hear that even the
traffic between Adelaide and Melbourne is still
conducted by ox-car.

On the Governor’s Staff,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Scene: A Smoking-room. Characters : Two
members of “ the Staff” — one, a man of forty ;
the other, a boy of twenty-two or three.
Man : “Ted, my boy, a warning to you re your
flirtations. Under certain conditions, they would
probably be sport to you and not death to the
other side. If flirt you must, ’ware girls. That
sweet thing in pink has a mamma, a very old cam-
paigner, and she’ll have you fixed for life before
you know where you are. Australian mothers are
death on the Staff.”
Boy : “ Look here, Mervyn, you’ve a devil of a
down on girls. You can’t see me a little more
than ordinarily polite to one without warning me,
as if there were some great unknown peril just
ahead.”
“ What do you call a mother-in-law but a very
great unknown peril? It’s just that ‘little more
than ordinarily polite ’ that does the mischief.
‘ The little more, and how much it is;
The little less, and what worlds away! ’
By Jove ! I had a bad quarter-of-an-hour through
the ‘ little more ’ business. I’ve given girls a wide
berth since. Believe me, old man, if flirt you
must, confine your attentions to the pretty married
women of your acquaintance.”
“ I’ll say this for you : you practise what you
preach. If I made the pace a bit hot with my
pink girl, you made it a lot hotter with Mrs. .
I call it downright poaching—spooning another
man’s wife, like that. If I sail a bit near to a
mother-in-law, you Sail a jolly sight nearer the
Divorce Court.”
“Don’t worry about me, my boy! My affec-
tions shall be transferred to the next bride. The
old lot are a shade stale. If you marry the Pink-
’un I’ll initiate her in the art of how far a married
woman can go without running foul of the tabbies
or her hub.”
“No, I’m blessed if you do. But I’m not going
to marry for another 10 years, at least. I’ll have
a good time first. But, I say ! do awful example
for my sake and tell us what scorched you off
girls. I’m hanged if I didn’t think you’d had a
knock somehow. Did she chuck you ? ”
“ Chuck be blowed. I’m hanged if I would not
tell you if I thought it would act as a salutary
warning. I promised your mother to keep you
out of mischief. But there’s one thing every man
will buy at his own expense, and that is his ex-
perience of women.”
“ The deuce of a lot they pay, I suppose you
think, for the deuce of a little ! ”
“ You pay the price, but you never get the ex-
perience : you end as you began, by finding women
a riddle. There are a few hard and fast rules that
apply to all women up to a certain point. Past
that point an ordinary man is bushed, as they say
here. At that point I give them best myself.”
“ You are a cool old card. But ante-up that
‘ experience. ’ I should like to hear of you being
in a hole for once. ”
“You’re a cheeky young beggar, but here you
are:
_“ I was on the staff in one of the other pro-
vinces at the time of my girl-scare. Was very
young; and, as I thought, very smart. Even at
that stage confined my attentions to married
women—then, as now, a marriage-certificate was a
license to flirt. One night I broke my rule. It
was at a dance following some theatricals one of
my divinities had given. As hostess, she was
rather too much occupied to let me fool around
her; but, you know, women are dog-in-the-
manger-like, and she didn’t wish me to be ensnared
by any of her married rivals. Knowing I didn’t
affect girls, and to keep me safe, she told me to
dance with and be nice to a dear girl-friend of
hers—a quite too-pretty little thing. I promised
to do as I was bid. She walked me up and intro-
duced me to her friend Blue-Eyes. I didn’t catch
her name, so christened her Blue-Eyes—hers were
so big and blue—a pleading look in ’em as if they
expected a lot from you. As long as we were danc-
ing it was all right. She had nothing to say, but
that didn’t matter. After the dance, knowing the
house, I found a quiet nook for two—a place that
had been curtained off as a sort of waiting-room
for some of the actors. I knew we’d be quiet in
there; the general public didn’t know of its exist-
ence; and the actors would think it full of pro-
perties. In I took Blue Eyes, cleared the rubbish
off a couple of chairs, and down we sat.
“ ‘Jolly dance,’ I said. ‘ Very,’ she replied.
“ ‘ Good floor, and band in great form to-night.’
* Great,’ she remarked.
“ ‘Jolly house for a dance; plenty of get-away.’
‘Plenty,’ said Blue-Eyes, looking in the half-light
awfully pretty, with that pleading look in her big
eyes shining away at me.
“I went on through the opera of the day ; the
last polo-match; novel of the hour; and all the
local social jargon I could think of. She agreed
sweetly with everything, but my conversation for
girls—as distinguished from married women, you
know—was played out. I had asked her to sit out
the next dance, so couldn’t take her back to
the ball-room. Hang it all! I thought, I must
rouse something out of her; I’ll try the personal
flattery touch. Round I worked to the personal:
‘ Who did she think was the belle ? ’ She warmed
up and was quite sure somebody-or-other was. I,
of course, denied it. Then who was ? Of course,
Blue-Eyes. She dimpled and flushed up, trying
to hide that she was pleased; but her eyes gave
her away.
“ Finding I was on the right track, I put it on
thicker—said I had given my hostess no peace
until she had introduced me to her. She
was the only girl I was going to dance
with. Yards of it I gave her. I got quite
interested in my thawing process. Her blushes
came and went; she looked quite alive and
awfully pretty. I put on the pace; talked
the usual rot, and in less than no time, after
a lot of love at first sight, I had her in my arms
kissing her like mad —you know, Ted, how one
warms to the work at two-and-twenty. She, after
a few faint ‘Don’ts,’ which I strangled with
kisses, seemed to take kindly to it. It seemed the
only answer to the pleading look in her eyes—so
much more eloquent than her tongue. There we
were, hard at it, spooning away—l quite delighted
to have got ahead of her monosyllabic answers to
my idiotic questions ; she quite satisfied with the
change of programme; both fully occupied ; when
lo ! —the curtain was lifted !
‘ ‘ Three women stood on the threshold! Two of
them I did not know; the third was, alas; my
divinity of the hour. Blue-Eyes saw nothing—
her head being turned to my shoulder. I put her
down as quickly as I could. She turned and saw
—made a rush at one of the unknown :
“ * Oh, mother, dear, I’m so happy; he loves
me! ’
“Oh Lord ! wasn’t lin a hole ! The old lady
put her pince-nez to her eyes. Ted ! I’ve faced a
Zulu’s assegai, but it was nothing to facing that
pince-nez.
“ ‘ Indeed, dear,’ she said, ‘ and who is he ? ’
“Then came forward my divinity—her face
wearing the most fiendish little ghost of a smile :
‘ Let me introduce Captain Wardry to you, Mrs.
Angus. _ Olive has made a great conquest : the
captain is supposed to be a girl-hater.’
“ The old lady, briefly acknowledging the intro-
duction, gathered her chick under her wing, looked
like a graven image in pince-nez, and said : ‘ Pray
what am I to understand by this little scene?
Olive seems very agitated. Shall I tell Mr. Angus,
Captain Wardry, that you wish to see him to-
morrow ? ’
“ My divinity looked almost ugly : she had such
a savage grin of satisfaction at the awful hole she
knew I was in. I was simply dumbfounded —
could not rise to the occasion anyhow. But get
engaged to a girl I hardly knew with the woman I
thought I did love looking on—l couldn’t! I
stuttered and stammered, and at last jerked out
something to the effect that it was ‘ all a mistake:
Miss Blue-Eyes fainted. Tried to bring her round.
Didn’t know how it happened ; didn’t know what
else to do; not used to girls ; couldn’t talk to ’em.
Always heard in faint best thing slap ’em, rouse
’em. Tried my best; hope she’s right now. Room
deuced close. Alyvays heard let ’em lie where
they fell. Caught her in my arms—just coming
round when mother came.’
“ I did feel a fool; however, I spluttered through
enough to show I didn’t want to see Mr. Angus.
Blue-Eyes was crying now ; her mother fixed me
with a stony stare, saying, ‘ That rigmarole
simplymeans you amused yourself at my daughter’s
expense. Very gentlemanly conduct for one of
the staff ! Our Governor is to be congratulated
that he has no daughters—though, perhaps, if he
had, his staff would be more carefully chosen. ’
“ I muttered out abject apologies; looked round
physically and mentally for a loophole by which
to escape. But the old lady made a move: ‘ Come,
Olive. We’ll bid Mrs. Wynton good-night and go
home.’ And, ignoring me, off they went; and I
was left face to face with my divinity.
“* As you are strong,’ I said, ‘be merciful. Let
me off with a caution. I swear I’ll never speak to
a girl again.’ If you had only let me keep with
you, I’d not have got into this beastly mess. The
girl wouldn’t talk beyond ‘ yea ’ and ‘ nay.’ I was
at my wits’ end to know what to do, and she had
a deuced kissable mouth.’
“ ‘ How about the faint ? ’
“ ‘ Oh, dash it all,’ I said. ‘ I had to say some-
thing ; you wouldn’t have had me give the girl
away. What a hole I was in ! Won’t I get
chaffed when the fellows hear of it! ’
‘“I don’t suppose it will get about,’ she said.
The mother will say nothing, as it tells against
her daughter. The same applies to Olive. I
won’t tell, to be twitted about my admirer’s defec-
tion ; you won’t tell, to make a laughing-stock of
yourself! ’
“ ‘ But how about the other woman ? ’
“ ‘ Oh, I forgot her ; you’re undone ; she’s the
greatest sieve in Australia.’
‘“Whatever brought you all here like that,
prying about ?’ I asked.
‘“We had been upon the stage; Mrs. Angus
said how quickly all had been put in order again
and the properties got rid of ; I said not in order,
only hidden—chaos behind that curtain—and just
lifted it to show the chaos—little thinking the
tableau of the evening was to be shown to the
chosen few impromptu. Very impromptu and
very vivant : I never shall forget your horror-
stricken face when you were struggling to get up
and Olive was hanging on to you. Don’t be
frightened. I had my vengeance in witnessing
your quarter-of-an-hour with mamma Angus. But
you mustn’t expect me to believe in you again,
though I cry pax and will take you and give you
a Pj c k' lne ' u P —you look several cups too low.’
By Jove, I felt it; nothing takes it more out
of a man than to be made to feel and look a fool.
Now you have it, Ted ; that was my girl-scare.”
* * m *
The Boy : “ There’s no doubt it was an awkward
time; real bad luck the mother coming in when
she did the girl might have been married and
her husband appeared. Your ‘divinity of the
hour’ took it well.”
Man ; “There was a reason for that. While
I d been fooling the girl, she’d been making the
running with a new man we had on the staff, so
was really glad of an excuse to cool off with me.
Then it seemed she owed Mrs. Angus one for an
unpalatable lecture re her flirtations, so it was
nuts to her catching Olive in the act. Of course,
the thing got about, and I dropped in for a lot of
chaff. The Anguses cut me. But the Burmah
row came on and I was ordered to join, so cleared.”
“ Ever hear what became*of Blue-Eyes? ”
“ Yes; Harding told me when he came home
that she had married an old colonial Judge, and
was the greatest flirt in the colony. ”
“ Better have another go-in, now she’s married.”
“No, thanks. But you take the advice of a
veteran, and ’ware girls ! ”

The N.S.W. Public Service Board is no
respector of persons. Among the retrenched is a
son of ex-Premier Dibbs.
N.S.W. Premier Reid is a most impres-
sionable man. When last he attended “ East
Lynne ” he wept copiously.
N.S.W. Premier Reid’s private residence
has, for some time, The Bulletin hears, been
guarded by from two to four policemen.
The late Donald Larnach, formerly of
Bathurst, N.S.W., left .£600,000, all of which
goes to his widow, children and grand-children.
Mr. Arthur Kemmis (a brother of Canon
Kemmis), who died suddenly last week at Sydney,
was a member of Landsborough’s exploring-party.
A Hannan’s Govt, official is credited with
having made close on .£lOO,OOO out of mining
specs. He talks of resigning his £2OO-a-year
billet.
The father of Justice Windeyer and the
father of James R. Fairfax (S.M. Herald) worked
together on London Morning Chronicle, the one
as reporter and the other as compositor.
Dean Cowper, of Sydney, who was born in
N.S.W. and has been for 60 years a local clergy-
man, entered his 85th year last Friday. When he
was born his father was the only clergyman in
Sydney.
Melb. demise : Jaques Martin. Reck-
oned, perhaps, the crack insurance-expert south
of the Line. For years he had been crippled,
and, like Vogel, he bravely bore up against a ter-
rible sea of physical troubles.
Dr. Bevan, pastor of Melb. Independent
church, has resigned his position on the council
of the local Anti-Sweating League without com-
ment. Apropos, Sargood, M.L.C. and Flinders-
lane magnate, is a prominent member of the
pastor’s church.
Mrs. Ann Meikle, who died the other day
in Sydney at an advanced age, was largely instru-
mental, over 50 years ago, in having the Church of
St. Patrick in Charlotte Place erected on the spot
on which a convict priest clandestinely celebrated
the first R.C. service conducted on Australian
soil.
Henry Gyles Turner’s lamentation over
the success of the “ new ” Australian poets (whose
work is republished from The Bulletin) seems
unkind. Turner himself wouldn’t have been at all
a famous bard but for The Bulletin printing one
of his efforts with a parody. Also, his present
reputation as a bank-director was largely created
by this journal, which has brought him into notice
whenever he deserved it. And yet he speaks of
Paterson ancj Lawson as “ these men,” as though
he were breathing a silent “blanky” before the
noun. The base ingratitude ! But—as old man
Jaikes remarked of Bodges, the baker—-we put it
down to his ignorance and his squint. His moral
or intellectual squint.
Daring the
election for King
Division, when
Parkes opposed
Reid, the late
John Davies was
boss organiser and
principal under-
ground engineer
for Parkes, and in
that capacity had
to pass printing-
orders. A rhymed
squib on Reid,
called “ The Tin-
pot Caesar,” was
written by a Syd-
ney journalist, and
there was some
question as to the
signature. “Sign
it ‘ Outis,’ ” sug-
gested John, who
laughed at his own
brilliant concep-
tion of attaching,
to a satire on
Reid, the consoli-
dated pen - name
of a gang of Reid’s
oarrackers in Syd-
ney Telegraph.
The writer de-
murred on the
ground of profes-
sional etiquette,
and John, with a
suavity which was
his chief charac-
teristic — next to
his cast-iron cheek
—instantly
agreed. But the
screed was signed
“Outis” all the
same.
Poor old J ohn
Nimmo, the Vic.
teetotal saint of
Premier Perman-
ent fame, was
once, when a
member of the
Gillies Cabinet,
paying an official
visit to Fernshawe
to inspect the
water - supply.
After a laborious
climb over preci-
pices and 22deg.
hills, the party
halted and the
bottle was passed.
John glared at the whisky-drinking sinners, and
noticing that one man declined the proffered hquor,
he accosted the man and made him a friend for the
day. At sundown, on returning to the starting-
point, Nimmo shook hands effusively with the
stranger, and congratulated him on ] us
hatred of the demon drink. Oh, replied tne
new-made friend, “ I like it well enoughi; but you
see, I keep a pub. myself and it doesn t do.
In the “good” old days of Westralia a
well-known postal official wrote to the P.M.G. for
an increased salary—“ he had a large family, and
his pay was inadequate to maintain it. The reply
briefly stated that “ Poor men should not have
large families.”
The shilling subscription for a monument
to be erected at South Head over the remains of
“Old Jack "Robertson now totals .£lO9, and as
that sum is not enough it is suggested that the
restriction limiting the subscription to one shilling
shall be removed in order that the many cheques
available may be received.
A Sydney railway official, claiming kinship
with a long-deceased millionaire named Shairp, is
at present busy working up his legal standing.
The cash comes to over <£3,000,000 and there ns a
Scotch patent of royalty also in the line. Ihe
Sydneyite has already spent a couple of years in-
come in pursuit of his destiny.
Before Trenwith emerged into political
light, although well-known as exceptionally able
in Trades Hall circles, he was prosecuted for stick-
ing up bills which referred to certain members of
his trade —bootmakers —as “scabs.” Purves got
him off, by referring to “ this poor,„ ignorant
fellow, who knows nothing of the law.’
Melb. : “ Hancock is rabid. The Age has
dropped reporting him because, in a speech at
Oastlemaine, he announced his intention of found-
ing a new Melb. morning-paper to give work to
the men who will be linotyped off the Age. Han-
cock declares he is in earnest, and is busily can-
vassing Says he already has £BOOO capital pro-
mised, with £4OO a week in advertising. In six
months, he declares, all will be ready, just when
the shunted Age comps, shuffle out of their present
office.”
Sydney Star, the alleged N.S.W. Protec-
tionist and wholly beer paper, having used the
longevity of Parkes as an argument for moderate
drinking, and contrasted it with the comparative
brevity of the career of John Davies, a total
abstainer, received from a teetotal correspondent
a tu quoque : “that on the same line of reasoning
it could be proved that the Star was responsible
for Davies’s death, inasmuch as Davies read the
Star, while Parkes made a boast that he never
did.” But the Star didn’t publish that ginger-
beer rejoinder.
Chief Justice Way (S.A.), a candidate for
the proposed Australian seat on the Privy Council
judicial committee, claims that none of his judge-
ments have ever been upset. Way had a meteor 10
bar career, and at one bound became Chief Justice,
but he was appointed by the Ministry of which he
was Attorney-General, much to the disgust of the
other Judges. Little “ Sammy now owns and
works the farm on which he was originally appren-
ticed as farm-boy, and, like his colleague Boucaut,
makes a good income as a horse-breeder. He is a
confirmed bachelor.
The capture of lawyer G-eake at Monte
Video was the result of £lOO reward, offered by
Vic. Government the day after the scandal of
THE PENALTY OF GREATNESS.
MISS GUSHER : “ Then tell me you’re no end of a dab at sculpture .”
THE MODEST BUT GREAT MAN : “ Well, I have done a good bit of modelling
in my time."
MISS G.: “ Oh, then do model something for my album!”
Geake’s easy flight had been exposed in The
Bulletin. It was a “ friend ”of the missing man
who gave his whereabouts away, after stipulating
that his statement, if correct, would earn the
£lOO. Save us from our friends ! The cable-
description of Geake reached Monte Video only
an hour or two before he came to hand, per
steamer Ruahine, and in another day he might
have been beyond the probability of arrest.
A young member of the House, thinking
himself slighted by the Speaker, once threatened
to move the adjournment to ventilate his grievance.
Parkes said to him, with a humorous and sly
smirk—“ Hi don’t think Hi’d do that if Hi were
you.” “ Why not ?” said the enraged one. “Well,
the honly reason Hi can give is that Hi’ve been a
member hof this ’Ouse for 35 years, and Hi never
did it 1 ” And this reason prevailed.
THOSE BLOOMERS AGAIN.
Now , whore did Brown learn this trick?
Ex-Treas. Ward, the M.L. parliamentarian
now financially crippled, was unknown as a public
man ten years ago. He made his first big rise m
1888, when, foreseeing the effect the Australian
drought would have on the produce trade, he
financed himself into a “future” in oats, and
cleared .£30,000 in four months. Then his poli-
tical career opened, and too much attention to
public affairs and too little to his own wrought his
ruin. He was modest in his personal expenditure
—as instance, during a visit to England, he was
presented at Court attired in a costume hired
from a Bond-street tailor for a guinea or two.
X. : “ Couchman (not Templeton) was the
Vic. Mines-Secretary whom Anarchist Andrews
reviled one minute before suspension from office.
Couchman was afterwards with Templeton on the
Public Service (boom) Board. The two Secre-
taries who succeeded Couchman at the JYLines
(Largtree and Howitt) became P.S. commissioners.
Howitt combines the job with Audit. Ihe
writer was in the Mines with Andrews, and re-
members him as a kindly fellow with normal
habits as to white shirts, etc. That was in his
‘ Temple Mystic ’ days ere the iron had elbowed
the poetry out of his soul.”
“ Cabbage Gardener ” writes to_ The
Bulletin !~~*
Give the devil his due. Geake, the defaulting and
bolting Daylesford (Vic.) solicitor, who now seems to have
been arrested in South America, was palpably run into
his dishonest courses by his mania for playing the philan-
thropist—and he was a philanthropist, mark you, and his
experience in this direction would form a curious psycho-
logical study of the unpretentious order. He literally did
“ (rood by stealth.” And no doubt, under the circum-
stances, he blushed profusely at finding it fame. On
the surface he seemed a smug hypocrite, who rooked the
unsuspecting and confiding in the name of religion.
Underneath he was nothing of the sort, and he did not
steal to keep additional households of his own, or to sup-
port gambling saloons ; he stole to help the poor and
needv. This, of course, is no justification for his crime ;
but there are quite as many bless Geake’s name as curse
him.
Parkes was very fond of telling stories of
his political rival, old Jack Robertson. One of
his favorites was to the effect that Jack, somehow
or other—though the most untravelled of men—
found himself in Melbourne. As he was going
along the street he was espied in the distance by
no less a personage than Benjamin Benjamin,
then Mayor of Melbourne, who set sail m pursuit.
He arrived, puffing and blowing, just as old Jack
got to Spencer-street station. “ Sir John, Sir
John,” said the panting alderman ; welcome to
Melbourne ! ” Old Jack turned round and eyed
him with disfavor. “ Who the hell are you ? ’ he
said. “Oh, I’m Mr. Benjamin, Mayor of Mel-
bourne.” “ Oh, so you’re the Mayor of the blanky
Cabbage-Garden, are you? Welcome to Mel-
bourne, eh ! ~ • -A before Bregy
had recovered his breath old Jack was over the
border at Albury.
The palpitating and expectant Windeyer
is said to lay no small stress, when urging his
claims for the Privy Council Judgeship, on
what is, looked at in the rough, a remarkable
series of triumphant “firsts.” For instance, he
was member of the “first” Parliament returned
under the N.S.W. Electoral Act of 1858. He was
the “first” member for SydneyUmversity. He was
elected member of the University Senate at its
u first ” convocation. He was the first Chan-
cellor who had graduated at the University. He
was the “first” to move that Austral-edu-
oated barristers should be eligible for N.S.W.
Supreme Oourt Bench, and. was the first barns-
ter so educated, to be promoted to that position.
Hence—but the argument is terribly of the post
non propter order —die merits to be the first to nil
the new billet of P.C. Judge. Many of Wm-
deyer’s “ firsts,” however, are to be credited to the
youth of the community—instead of to the talent
of the canvasser.
Randolph Bed-
ford, whose forceful
verse and prose are
well-known to Bul-
letin (and Melb.
Argus) readers, and
who is now going to
London about a mine,
is a young man of
somewhat rare abili-
ties and of unique
experiences as a city
pressman, bush editor
and free-lance in poli-
tics. The Bulletin
does not remember
anybody else who
ever interposed in
parliamentary elec-
tions in quite the
same impudent style
as R.B. —who would
suddenly turn up to
address the electors
as a candidate at the
very last moment be-
fore nomination,
without having even
secured a chairman.
When some of the
meeting began to
yell, Bedford would
fix the most promin-
ent yeller with his
glittering eye and say
—“ Look here, I’d go
for you if you were as
bigas a house.” Then,
suiting the action to
the word, R. Bedford
would pull off his
coat. By this time
the meeting would be
ready to listen atten-
tively to the candi-
date and give him an
enthusiastic vote of
confidence. It is true
that Randolph B.
never got into Parlia-
ment, but then he
never seriously tried.
A Bathurst identity, Mrs. Robert M‘Phil-
lamy, of Gorman’s Hill, passed over last week in
her 80th year. A native of N.S.W. she went over
the Blue Mountains with her father, squatter
Ashe, in 1821, the year following that in which
Macquarie went to the district and named it after
the Colonial Minister of the day. She never left
the district during three-quarters of a century,
and saw her descendants in the fourth generation.
Dead-and-gone Mount Morganaire Patti-
son will be remembered for many kindnesses in
Rockhampton, though, until ill-health and mis-
fortune toned him down, he was noisy, fat and
boastful beyond ordinary. A few years ago, when
there were rival claimants for the Golden Mount
and a consequent law-suit, the then-millionaire
swore that he’d fight to the bitter end, if he
bad to go to his butcher’s block again to pro-
vide the sinews of war. That trouble passed
away, but loss followed loss, and in the end the
careworn paralytic was glad enough to resume his
butchering business, not to get money for sensa-
tional litigation, but to earn bread and cheese.
He met his reverses bravely, and did his best to
keep promises made in prosperous days. The
<£looo for the Rockhampton Presbyterian Church
was raised midst storm and stress, though in by-
gone years an uncongenial parson had been bullied
out of his pulpit by the bumptious Elder, the
latter slapping his pockets and bellowing: “But
I’ve got the purse, mind ye ! I’ve got the purse !
When Gov. Lamington, &c., visited Rockhampton
the other day, moribund ex-Treasurer Pattison
dragged himself out of bed and watched their
arrival from his conveyance. Someone drew the
Governor’s attention to the invalid, and the old
man, having got the recognition he wanted, went
home to die after a few davs more suffering.
The recent death, at Tomki (N.S.W.), of
Mrs. Clark Irving, at a ripe old age, recalls
memories of her late husband, whom the deceased
lady survived by many years Mr. Clark Irving
was a member of the first N.S.W. Parliament
under responsible Government. At the time of
the American civil war he went to England a
wealthy man —his last balance-sheet, ere leaving
these shores, credited him with <£280,000. In
England he fitted out ships to run the blockade of
the American southern ports —a risky enterprise
pregnant with big possible losses or profits. How-
ever, his vessels were singularly fortunate in
eluding the Yankee blockade, and their cargoes
sold at famine prices in the besieged Southern
cities, and after the war Mr. Irving found himself
immensely wealthy. Knowledge of this and of
his enterprise made him the mark of every
financial adventurer, but he was an astute busi-
ness-man who personally looked into details before
venturing his money, and for a time he more than
held his own. Yet the day came when the bold
and long-headed man made the one foolish move
of his life. Mr. Irving was induced—by what
means his friends are still unacquainted—to em-
bark in certain wild-cat Spanish railway specula-
tions involving a million sterling, and he awoke
one morning to find himself ruined by a single
pen-stroke. Legal proceedings were to have fol-
lowed, but the adventurous Irving died soon
afterwards, leaving to his widow only the Tomki
property (14,000 acres freehold), which had been
™ pulled out of the fire ” by a legal friend now on
the English Bench. Mr. Irving was the father of
the bright and witty Sydney barrister, Clark
Irving, who died not long ago.

ness. No longer am I weighed down by official
thraldom. The love of freedom is again my heri-
tage. My friends offer me their sympathy, but

Gordian knot I had not the courage to cut myself.
When I look back on the past 27 years I can

Judge Williams (Vic.): “These repeated

Incidents in the Vic. Postal investigation
Bhow the absolute necessity of Vic. administration
grappling with the Orange Lodge nuisance in the

and, when late Ministers of the Crown were pro-

In case of a no-confidence motion in S.A.
Assembly, Kingston can rely on a majority of at
least 14. The greatest strength of the Opposition
in a crisis is 20 in a House of 54. Which explains
why the Ass papers continually refer to the
“intelligent phalanx of Oppositionists”—they
haven’t got the numbers.
Zox asks a question in Vic. Assembly as
to the amount of perjury by accused persons
giving evidence on their own behalf, and suggests
the abolition of the right. As the Judges and the

alleged right, it will probably be cut down to the
old unsworn statement.
Squatter Percy Chirnside, M.L.A., is
anxious for a reduction in the number of members
of Vic. Assembly. He would be, naturally. The
larger the constituencies the less chance for poor
men to canvass them properly, and the greater the
proportion of Chirnsides in the House. Even
Percy is clevah enough to understand that.
Victorian : “Nauseous, in a young country,

the brisk alacrity of business. The Doctrinaires

N.S.W. Premier Reid’s present financial
statement, though carefully prepared, is not
actually written out. Here and there paragraphs
are fully worded, but on the whole he relies,
beyond the tables of figures, very much on the
inspiration of the hour. Treasurers See and
Burns wrote out their financial speeches, and
what they didn’t commit to memory they read
from MS. ; but M‘Millan set the example of
phrasing as he went along.
Yic. M’sP. complain because the railway

Melville, of the Yic. Legislative Council:
“ Whatever happens you cannot make a great,
free and fighting people if you crush all spirit and
pride out of the mothers by a Factories Bill.”
The Yic. Factories Bill interferes chiefly with
those mothers who live by doing plain sewing at
home, and it proposes to prevent them being paid
less than the rate of wages for the same work in
factories. And Melville, M.L.C., is afraid this
interference will crush all pride and spirit out of
these mothers —who now keep up a lofty spirit
and a soaring soul making shirts for 14 hours a
day at tuppence each —and cause them to de-
generate, because they will then only have to
make shirts for perhaps nine hours a day. The
soulfulness of Melville, M.L.C. ! 11

S.A. village settlements have so far cost
S.A. Govt. <£40,929, whilst the improvements

11 settlements, the largest and most prosperous
being Lyrup, with 70 inhabitants. Most of the
settlements are to be broken up, and the land
divided on lease amongst the remaininginhabitants.
According to the latest gaol statistics the
average prison population in N.S.W. is 2600,
and the value of the prisoners’ work in a year is
barely .£52,000. The prison population can’t
strike, or go away to see the football-match; it is
almost entirely an adult
population; it is never
out of work ; it has no
eight - hour movement,
and it is supposed—a
great part of it, anyhow
—to be doing “hard”
labor. And the result
is Bs. worth of work
weekly for each prisoner.
This is what The Bulle-
tin means by the Gaol

Even the Chow him-

test against the above-

Telegram from Maitland (N.S. W.): —“The
prize offered by Mr. J. Brunker (Col. Sec.) for the
best written copy of the Lord’s Prayer was won
by Bertie House. The writing was judged by the

Mr. Brunker that his next prize should be for the
Lord’s Prayer in shorthand, and that he should
associate with himself, in the judging, his enter-
prising young relative, Mr. Curnow.
Freetrade lives in N.S. W. by the advocacy
of the Sydney dailies. The Sydney Freetrade
dailies live by the Protective policy of N.S.W.
Post-office in carrying newspapers post-free. It is
quite Jin-de-siecle for the dailies to curse their
benefactor; because it is a common Kerristian
achievement for a son to curse the mother that
suckled him. “ Honor thy father and thy
mother”—the Freetrade news-bosses have struck
it out of the Decalogue.
The Auckland (M.L.) police the other day
set a good example to all the other bobbies on
earth by hauling before the courts a well-known
church member— an elderly shining light of piety
—on a charge of letting his houses to brothel-
keepers. He was fined £2o —which should have
been d£loo—and costs. The shortest road to the
suppression of “ disorderly houses ” is to heavily
fine the good old pietist who owns the property
and publish his name in the papers.
Speaker Abbott’s new rule, determining
the priority of members applying for leave to move
the adjournment of the House, is construable as
an infraction of one or other of the N.S.W.
statutes dealing with lotteries. What is the differ-
ence between pulling a straw or slip of paper and
tossing a coin or taking a turn at heading-’em ?
Drawing lots is lottery—whatever the pretext may
be. Drawing slips of paper is—ahem ! —slippery
morality on the part of a lottery-condemning Par-
liament.
“Twenty people own 3,000,000 acres of
freehold land in Riverina.” Therefore, a Carru-
thers Closer Settlement Act is needed, and should
be passed by Parliament ? Not at all. A pro-
fressive land-tax is the remedy, or a Closer
ettlement Bill in which power is taken to re-
sume on the land-tax valuation. But the Reid-
Carruthers chorus is: “ We’ll not increase our
penny land-tax by the smallest fraction.” Then,
in parliamentary vulgate, “something must give
way.”
The ‘ * Colonial Party ” in the Commons
threatens to become an Imperial channel for the
circulation of lies re Australian character. The
remarks which Major-Gen. Hutton poured into
the Party last month would lead any ordinary
Britisher to imagine that the atmosphere of this
country is red with military instinct. Gen. Hutton,
no doubt, believes what he said. During his stay
here he moved round and round the little warlike
circle until he grew too dizzy to notice that the
civilians outside were laughing at him.
There is no valid argument against police-
men being granted the franchise that could not be
equally applied to all public servants. Also, if it
is held inadvisable for policemen to vote because
they are connected with the administration of the
law, then it should also be held that it is advisable
to exclude from the polling-booths all J’s.P., all
P.M’s., all Crown-Prosecutors, all Judges, and all
lawyers. A policeman is entitled to use a revolver
at discretion; why not give him a vote ? Nay,
more : a policeman’s oath is often magisterially
valued as exceeding the contrary oaths of six
civilians; why not give the policeman six votes’
There is a curious rift between the Age
and the Vic. Labor-party, that may or may not
arise from the proposed co-operative daily. In
true Tory style the Age pegs constantly at Social-
ism as a menace to the State and a sapping of the
foundations of society, &c., and the Labor mem-
bers take every opportunity in Parliament to de-
clare that they are out-and-out Socialists. Ben.
Tucker was returned for S. Melb. by the Trades
Hall, and the Age whimpered because Sam.
Mauger was not chosen. Also, the Age curtly
summarises Labor-speeches in the House, and gives
Deakin a full report—Deakin being its own pal,
mistrusted by Hancock and Co.
Captain Russell, leader of Maoriland Oppo-
sition, says that “he never received a penny from
the provinoe save his honorarium as an M.H.R.,”
and any statement to the contrary is a great,
howling untruth. Which is solemn fact. The
Act of Parliament which insists on rising like a
ghost out of the statute-book didn’t grant Russell
a penny or any other Bma.ll coin; it simply set
forth that he should have 800 acres of land in
Hawke’s Bay free of cost, and he has them to this
day. And the gallant captain wants to know why
people depend on the Government for assistance
now, instead of being a robust, independent race
as they were in the old days when he got 800 acres
without paying for them.
Victoria has started building its first rail-
way on the no-compensation principle. In the
new order of things, when a district wants a rail-
way and the work has been authorised and sur-
veyed, a local railway trust is formed. It is the
business of said trust to acquire the necessary
land and hand it over to the State free of cost,
and not till that is done does the machine begin
to revolve. The system seems to work well
enough. Some people give the land gratis ; some
have to be bought out by subscription after being
talked nearly to death by the r trust; some refuse
flatly to assist the movement, and have to be
judiciously boycotted or their credit stopped at
the store. The trust can bring pressure to bear
in a lot of ways. When things are practically
arranged, and only one cranky inhabitant blocks
the way, the frequency with which his horse gets
impounded is something remarkable.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Artist, The Bulletin’s fancy for the G.N.
Hurdle Race, was redeemed from absurdity by a blunder
at one of the early jumps. The chances are that Artist
was doomed to defeat anyway, like all the other heavy
and middle-weight favorites, but since he did meet with
an accident there’s an excuse for saying that only his
exceptional bad luck—for none of the others fell—pre-
vented him from winning in the proverbial canter.
The finish for Saturday’s big race at Flemington
was fought out midst a silence that could be felt. When
Buzzi and Zouroff came pounding down the straight
lengths in front of their more fashionable rivals nobody
seemed to care which of them would get home first. Even
the bookmakers viewed the matter with indifference, one
outsider being almost as acceptable as the other, so the
fraternity of Chosen Ones sauntered back to the paddock,
chewing the cud of moral reflection, and cried, “ Pay
Buzsey 1 Pay Buzsey !” in the tone of voice peculiar to
such occasions. With a few harmless exceptions
there was no “Buzsey” money to be paid away. There
they stood, with their bloated black bags resting against
their contented stummicks, gazing pleasantly at the
backers who had nothing to draw. The sombre Jack
Cohen, for the first time in his career, smiled over bis un-
expected “ skinner.” J.C. rides a bike of late, and his
liver, no doubt, is in such fine working order that he can
no longer dissemble his feelings. He smiled in spite ot
himself, whereupon all the other Cohens in the vicinity
ventured to do likewise.
Sam Cook protested that The Parisienne had
101 b. more than her due weight for the Winter Handicap.
Nevertheless the public, remembering The Admiral’s per-
formance in the same race last year, stood by the maroon*
and-silver, and went home quite cheerful after all.
Whernside, a tall, light-barrelled horse, was an-
other popular winner. The son of Glorious looked a
dandy among the moderate lot that saddled-up for the
Maiden Steeplechase, and, although it was said that the
Millers doubted his stamina and expected him to fail in
the last furlong, punters in general took the risk. Whern-
side, who jumps beautifully, stayed the two-mile course
very well, but maybe he is not old and stout enough for
the three-mile race next Saturday. Also, he cut one of
his fore feet in the Maiden.
The utter discomfiture of the “cracks” in the
G.N. Hurdle Race makes the Steeplechase appear a very
open race. If Dungan and Woonooke couldn’t go the pace
(which was only moderate) last Saturday, they are not
very likely to bring their heavier weights to the fore over
the big sticks, presuming that the field includes two or
three fairly warm members. Nor can J. 0.1. have a much
better chance that Dungan on the Adelaide form. None
of the recent performers among the Steeplechase candi-
dates strike one as being favorably handicapped, with the
exception of Mikado 11., who was a top-sawyer in days of
yore, and is now galloping as though he had recovered a
lot of his long-lost speed. Dondi should be dangerous, if
backed by the stable, and Timoni seems the best of the
light-weights. Something must win—anything may do
it. Tiie Bulletin fancies Mikado 11., or anything, the
latter for choice.
Either the large attendance at Flemington last
Saturday w>as a joyful surprise to the management, or
else the issue of official cards and books was, by accident,
much less than usual. Thousands of the later visitors
couldn’t get a programme anywhere. They were all sold
out in the streets, on the railway-station platform, and at
the course.
* * * *
Each of eight different Grand National Hurdle
starters was given an excellent chance by his owner ; four
were “ as good as gold,” and three couldn’t lose under
any circumstances whatever. “Jim” Farrell, owner of
the real winner, did not recommend Buzzi’s chance to his
bitterest enemy. Farrell formerly used Buzzi to round
up cattle in his paddocks at Wangaratta (Vic.). He
visited Melbourne three or four days before the race, not
having seen his horse for two years. After viewing him,
he said to a relative, “ I never saw him looking better
before, and if all the others fall he might win. I would
like to sell him before the race.” Eighteen months ago
Buzzi ran at Seymour against a field of common country
hacks, and never got a place.

“ From information received ” the fancy of the
vice-regal “push” at Caulfield on Saturday was Glen-
dower. If they had got on to the right “rough ’un,” one
or two of the books would have known it. Vice-regal
hangers-on are good backers.

“ Dick ” Row, owner of Mailboat, which carried
so much money in the Maiden Steeple at Caulfield last
Saturday, is Nellie Stewart’s husband. He stated before
the race that Mailboat was the best thing he had ever
sent.
* * * *
The only horse left in the Vic. G.N. Steeple
that can bring off an alliterative double—hurdles and
steeple—is Barrata, and he may not start. Strangely
enough, Buzzi, the “ first leg in,” is out of a mare named
Baratti.
* * * *
Unlucky number 13 was carried bv Buzzi and
Whernside last Saturday.
Two Sydney bookies rushed round to see if the
winner s name was really in the list of acceptors when the
National result came through. The ordinary layer only
takes stock in what he lays most of. Ask him about an
unthought-of a week before a big race, and he will ask
in an astonished tone : “Is he in?” Then, suspecting
you know something, he’ll add a pound to the odds.
* * * *
“Thirty-three to one, Buzzi”: a nominal ring
quotation for the press. What would a tote have re-
turned ?

The Vic. small stick surprise was far greater
than the Ellerslie sensation of ’9O, when “the ancient”
unexpectedly won for bookie Phillips, beating the un-
lucky Maorilander, Donald, by a neck. Ellerslie, a “ had
been,” was given a quiet special preparation, and stag-
gered the public. Yet he was weighted at 291 b. more
than Saturday’s winner.

Zourolf’s second in G.N. hurdles shows how
stables may go astray in their judgment. The horse
wouldn’t have started but for the interference of Tatt.’s
sweep ticket - holder. Zouroff had previously been
scratched for the steeple, and now !
* * * *
Buzzi’s trial for the race he won practically took
place on June 13, when he run past a good field and got
second to Black Flag in V.R.C. 2-mile hurdles. A three
weeks’ improvement brought off the boodle, and the touts
never noticed him gallop. Buzzi’s 9st. was the lowest
ever carried to victory. A horse called Dizzy 4 won with
9.4 thirteen years ago.
* * * «
One unusually honest Sydney tote-runner has
a list of probable starters wired from the course for each
event when suburban fixtures are on, and he pastes them
on his back-room board. Late backers don’t then support
non-starters. On Saturday he had a star against Buzzi’s
name for G.N. hurdles, indicating that he was an “un-
likely.” Luoky star!
• * * *
The argument against Artist’s chance in the big
race was that shrewd Tommy Wilson, of Ballarat, had
parted with the horse in the belief that he was only a
second-rater. Thomas seldom lets a good thing leave him.

The Leadek published a portrait of Leslie in
last issue, by way of suggesting that he would be Miller’s
best for the Hurdle Race. The same luckless journal
tipped Tantallon and Prince Consort for Melbourne Cup,
the year that their stable companion Carbine ran away
with the race. And yet the public imagine that pro-
fessional racing journalists are in a position to “ know ”
somethmg of the subject they write about. YVhv, they

duly planked their money on The Captain, and the bookies
stuck to it. He seems to be one of the “ occasional ” sort
very occasional. Well-backed Newcastle got to the
post easily from Loch Leigh. And he could have gone
much farther, only it wasn’t required according to the
conditions of the race.

Buszi, winner of the G.N. Hurdles, is named
after Signor Buzzi, the well-known basso, who came out
years ago with one of Simonsen’s Italian opera oo.’s, and
has enjoyed full pupil and engagement lists in Melbourne
ever since. Curiously enough, one of the syndicate who

drew Zouroff in Tatt.’s lives in the same boarding estab-
lishment as the Signor, sits next to him at table, and
both may frequently be seen at the theatre together.
When they ran first and second there was a big laugh
about “ stable companions.” . , ..
* * * *
Zouroff, second in the G.N. Hurdles, was drawn
in Tatt.’s by a syndicate of three, well-known on Mel-
bourne ’Change, who took 24 tickets in all. The horse
was then 33 to 1 in a final acceptance of 14, and was
regarded as an unlikely starter. The owner was inter-
viewed, the horse ran second, and each of the three
clears £335. The first prize in Tatt.’s big sweep went to
Miss M'Govern, Red Hill, Brisbane.

neddy said he wasn’t going to start. “ Withdraw, eh?’’
“ Not me; not yet. Ye see, the public always seem to
flop on to my horses, and by keeping this ’un in it will
amuse them reading his name in the lists. Besides, he’s
not quite ‘ straight,’ and I want to sell. If I draw out
before acceptance-day, prospective buyers might think
he’s cronk, and (winking) he ain't, dy’e see ?”

A graceful lady-punter, with her own ideas of

on hurdler YVhitefoot because he was out of a mare named
Hope. Her spec, returned £7, whioh she told bookie to
keep and put on Loch Fad. This swelled her little bank
to £2B. “ Plank it all on Newcastle for the next,” said
bookie, hoping to keep it; “he’s a moral.” But the fair
one wouldn’t play any more. To bookie’s surprise, New-
castle won.

The hypocrisy of the N S.W. gambling laws
was never more cheekbonedl.v shown than by the admis-
sion in Parliament, the other day, of Chief-Secretary
Brunker that betting at Kensington outside the race-
course-fence is a crime which the police-department is
vigorously suppressing, while betting inside the fence is
an act not known to the law as punishable. In N.S.W.,
therefore, the price of a license to commit a certain crime
is one shilling, to be paid to a horse-club.

Yorkshire had all the worst of the luck in the
third match of the Australians. The visitors, batting first
on a “ perfect” wicket, made 224, after which their oppo-
nents had scored 112 for the loss of five men when stumps
were drawn. Rain fell during the night and next morn-
ing, and Yorkshire resumed business on a heavy wicket,
but “a drying wind was blowing across the ground.”
'L'he next five men put 33 runs on to the score, “ M’Kibbin
being unplayable.” Then the Australians started their
second innings with the drying wind in their favor. This
side of the case was not commented on by the cable re-
ports, although, if Yorkshire had won the toss and “ Our
Boys ” had been handicapped by weather conditions
well, we would have heard something about the uncer-
tainty of cricket.

The “ North of England ” combination included
only one member (wicket-keeper Lilley) of the All-Eng-
latid Eleven that met Australia at Lord’s. Considering
the poor quality of some of the English teams that carry
a representative title, it is rather surprising that the first
“ test ’’-match eleven was so carefully selected. The
strength of the Australians is evidently not underrated,
although the counties are not sparing their best men to
play against them oil every possible opportunity, as they
did of yore. Such batsmen as A. G. Steel, for instance,
used to follow the visitors round the country, and Grace
met the last Australian Eleven many times.

push one end of a Govt, saw in Adelaide Exhibition-

Dear Bulletin,—What are Trott and Harry
going to do in England ? According to a recent article in
London Daily Chronicle, the average earnings of a Prst-
rate professional cricketer are- all the year thrown i i—
£l Os. 9d. a week. They get £5 a match, and an occa-
sional bonus if they make a hundred, and are six months
idle. If this article be true, the mystery, long unex-
plained, of George Giffen and Aliek Bannerman pegging
away at small Government salaries in Australia is now
plain. Moreover, the wide gulf inexorably fixed between
the amateur and the professional in England makes, or
ought to make, the latter position intolerable to an Aus-
tralian. We o'ten hear in England of an amateur runner
becoming professional—or cyclist, sculler, boxer, fo >t-
baller ; but never a cricketer. So I think We shall agirn
have the pleasure of the company of these two distin-
guished Australians, unless they can work it as Philips
does, and do six months’ professional work in each hemi-
sphere.—Yours, Traveller.

Saturday’s Melb. football matches, in any case a
poor lot, were spoilt by the wind. South beat Port Melb.
4 goals to 3 goals, after the day’s most interesting
struggle, and although Essendon had trouble in shaking
off Richmond (who played 21 men) till the last quarter,
the unbeaten team, with customary dash, put on 6 goals
in the final 2t)min., winning by 9 goals to 4 goals. Col-
lingwood beat St. Kilda, and Williamstown downed
Footscray. \

V.F.A., still feebly attempting to revive senior
football interest, has appointed committees to revise the
rules of the game. The Ass. seems incapable of realising
that insistence on the existing rule forbidding profes-
sionalism would almost put the game on its feet again.
Plenty of honest interest centres in junior contests where
professionalism is unknown, and with the big clubs play-
ing on a similar footing the lack-of-interest difficulty
would disappear.

Special Qualities of Cellular Clothing.
1. It is practically a supplementary skin, retaining warmth and yet permitting of free evaporation. 2. Owing to the retention of air
(the best non-conductor of heat) in the cells of the cloth, it is WARM IN WINTER and cool in summer. 3. Being exceptionally porous,
it is the cleanliest and most easily washed of all forms of clothing. 4. It is extremely durable, and is economical in every way. 5. By this
system of manufacture the question of materi 1 (Cotton, Wool, or Silk) BECOMES QUITE OF SECONDARY IMPORTANCE, THE
RETENTION OF AIR IN THE CELLS DETERMINING THE WARMTH OF CELLULAR CLOTHING.
Cellular Corsets.
The Cellular Corset, fitted throughout with REAL WHALEBONE, gives support without im-
peding respiration. It allows perfect freedom of action, and possesses the additional advantage of
being porous, by which it is rendered cool in summer and WARM IN WINTER. The structure,
though soft and supple, retains its shape to the last. The Cellular Corset is excellent for Walking,
Riding, Dancing, Tennis, Cycling, and, indeed, for all active games and exercises.

TO MINING COMPANIES, BATTERY OWNERS
AND OTHERS.
Increase your yields by Saving the Pine Gold
and Pyrites by the use of
Wynne and Tregurtha f s
Patent Battery Plates.
This invention, lately patented, revolutionises the ordi-
nary battery treatment of ores, for by its use copper-
plates, quicksilver, and chemicals are entirely dispensed
with. The Wynne and Tregnrtha Patent Battery Plates
are made of iron, cast with peculiarly-shaped ribs. They
are fitted in a wooden frame, and take the place of the
ordinary copper-plates and blanket tables. The tailings
on leaving the stamper boxes pass over the plates which,
from their construction, catch the fine gold and pyrites,
allowing the sand and water to flow away. When the
plates are fully charged with the concentrates they are
then tilted backwards by means of a lever, throwing the
contents into a trough underneath. In practical use
much better results have been obtained by these plates
than by the ordinary copper ones, the yield of gold being
increased bv fully 10 per cent. Excellent results have
been achieved in the treatment of refractory ores, where
the gold is associated with some foreign mineral, which
has proved deleterious to the mercury and causing the
loss of the gold. The plates are strong, simple m con-
struction, and easily handled, and can be obtained from

Eno’s “Fruit Salt ” removes poisonous matter
caused by vitiated air, errors of eating and drink-
ing, &e., by natural means. No one is safe with-
out having at hand some efficient means of warding
off blood poisons. After a very patient and careful
observation, extending over nearly ten years, of the
effects of Eno’s “Fruit Salt,” I have not the
least hesitation in stating that if its great value in
keeping the body healthy were universally known,
not a single travelling trunk or portmanteau would
be without it. J. C. Eno, ‘ ‘ Fruit Salt ” Works,
London, S. E. Sold by all chemists and stores.*
In Sydney, when you want to find a dis-
tinguished traveller, or a big mining expert, or a
church dignitary, or a man of influence or means,
the bee-line to reach that man is along the tele-
phone-wire to the Hotel Australia. The palatial
establishment is on the top for everything, bar
price —that is strictly moderate : 12s. 6d. per day
upwards, inclusive of all meals and attendance.
It has its own telephone and telegraph-office, and
in general and in detail it secures the highest
commendation from visitors.*

An old-time crowd paid or got over the fence
for the Randwick-Wallaroo final. The brilliant game,
bristling with incident, savagery and what-not, ended foi
Randwick by 6 to 5. Their reckoned lien on the
game proved a risky one, and in future the club should
insure its mortgages in some respectable city office, and
save something out of a probable wreck. The teams
played a death or glory game, the public favoring the
W.’s, who were 6 behind once. When they scored 5 the
crowd yelled madly and skied their hats. The R.’s dallied
with time when ahead, and earned the censure of the
heated populace.
* * * *
A treble annual win has made the Association
Cup the sole property of Randwicks.
Two players ordered off on Saturday ; one for
kicking at another fellow, and a second for tackling a
man who hadn’t the ball and, probably, didn’t want it.
Some kickers appear to pay more attention to the man
than to the oval.
* * * *
The ’Varsity-Pirate scrum was an even-handed
affair, U.’s whooping home by sto 3. But it wasn’t a very
big whoop. Both scored a try, and both kicked a goal,
but someone touched the Pirate ball as it was going over,
and “ no goal ” was proclaimed. The skull-and-crossbones
certainly have no luck.
• * * *
Judging from the dearth of cable-news, there is
very little Hinglish interest in the match between scullers
Stanbury and Harding. The local man has probably
begun to think that he is too small for the job.

Adelaide football continues to deteriorate, and
attendance-records are below even those of ’95. So far,
S. Adelaide is top, Norwood second.
* * * *
Gustave Marsehner, the just-arrived German
trick cyclist, gave a private view at Melb. Town Hall last
Thursday. He is a scrap of a man, about sft. 3in., but
beautifully built. Marsehner is a sort of Frantz family on
wheels, or rather on a wheel, for most of his feats are
done on half a bike. He does all Maltby’s tricks and a
lot over, performing ori the safety as well as the ordinary.
His really wonderful performance finished by his disin-
tegrating his jigger bit by bit, riding each of the different
pieces one after the other. Ultimately left with a single
(ordinary) wheel, he took a ride round on it, then coolly
stripped it of its rim, and rode a lap on the points of the
spokes. Marsehner then discarded that part of the wheel,
and, seizing the rim, got inside it, and, turning himself
into the hub and spokes, spun around the building and
bowed himself out.
* * * *
Item from Echuca (Vic.): “A cyclist and
cycliste, riding in opposite directions, came into collision
in High-street this evening. The gentleman sustained an
injury to his liver. Neither had lights.”
* * * *
A bicycle ambulance is the latest. The bike
carries the ambulance with it. The stretcher is fastened
to the top of the cycle, and the person wounded (presum-
ably by falling off) can then, in the words of the humane
prospectus, “ be. rolled along in a safe and gentle manner.”
This invention will enable the fiery cyclist to convey the
old lady whom he has run over "to the nearest hospital
without delaying his ride, or endangering his time-record
to any great extent.

From the “Cycling Column” in a London
sporting journal : —“ Miss Frankie Nelson disappointed a
lot of people at first, but as soon as she got accustomed to
the track she made a much better show. She must be
fairly good, or Billy Madden and his wife would not have
taken the pains they did to get her fit.” As Chaucer (even
in his day) remarked, “ Where is the grace that whilom
wont in woman to appear ?”

Twenty-three Chow cabbage-men competed the
other day in a half-mile race under the auspices of Auck-
land (M.L.) Athletic Club. The spectacle of Chinamen
in a hurry gave unalloyed pleasure to the crowd.

A Maoriland paper doesn’t forecast horse results
because “it is criminal to speculate on an uncertainty.”
This, from a mining journal, is pretty rich. Sportsmen
won’t coincide. Neither should the clergy.
* * * •
One result of the pernicious continuous racing
policy is that some trainers regard it as quite a compli-
ment to start fancied neddies in either small or high-stake
events.
* * * *
N.Y. courts lately decided that “racing for a
stake is not a lottery.” Wise decision. From a punter’s
point of view though, racing is a lottery. And, in Aus-
tralia, the lottery rules the racing.
* * * •
The well-worn statement that people gamble at
the expense of the butcher, the baker, and grocer, was
mentioned to a knight of the block the other day. “ Yes,
maybe so. But I do a cash biz. mostly, and don’t care.
However, butchers and bakers and grocers gamble just as
much as anybody else. Butchers are generally out-and-
outers. Ye see, we’re sports.”
* * * *
Damper, a disappointing Melbourne horse that
has dropped a lot of good money for Purves, Q.C., and
others, was sold, the other day, to a Perth (W.A.) sport,
who evidently expects the brute to benefit by a change of
air. Damper is well-named up to date.

rpHIS COMPANY is formed for the purpose of ac-
quiring and working three mineral blocks of dia-
mondiferous and auriferous land, under application for
Lease, comprising 140 acres, situated in the Bingara
Diamond Field, Parish of Bingara, County of Murchison,
New South Wales, and adjoining the now famous Monte
Christo Diamond Mine, and that of the Australian Dia-
mond Mines Proprietary Company. The property is
admirably situated for working the extensive beds of
diamondiferous wash, known to exist over the greater
portion of the three blocks. .
The wash varies from 12 inches to 14 feet in thickness,
carrying both diamonds and gold. In places the wash
crops out on the surface, and in other places is overlaid
with layers of basalt. Several shafts have alieady been
sunk, in which the wash contains both diamonds and
gold. Formerly the portion along the creek yielded rich
returns of gold. The miners did not then know the value
of the diamonds, which were allowed to pass away in the
tailings. A stream of water runs through the property,
sufficient for supplying the diamond dressing plant. This
is immediately available, and of the most suitable descrip-
tion for treating on a large scale the wash for the recovery
of both diamonds and gold. Operations could be com-
menced immediately, as the machinery could be landed
on the spot within one month. There are no difficulties
of transit, as the mine fronts the main road.
This Diamond Field has passed the stage where Geolo-
logists are required to give opinions. The prospector has
by sinking and driving, proved the highly payable charac-
ter of the country. All that is required now is capital to
develope the mines in a systematic and intelligent
manner, with machinery suitable for saving the diamonds,
tvhen large returns may be looked for by the owners of
claims in this diamondiferous country. The favorable
reports on the field by the following eminent geologists,
the late Rev. W. B. Clark, the late Mr. C. S. Wilkinson,
and Messrs. W. Anderson and J. A. Coghlan, have been
more than verified by actual results in prospecting and
working over a large area. . , ,
The development of this wonderfully rich Diamond
Field, like many of the undeveloped gold and Mineral
Fields of Australia, has been retarded by the calamitous
financial troubles, from which Australia is now emerging.
Extract from annual report of the Department
of Mines, N.S.W., 1893: —
“ Bingara is the principal seat of the diamond
mining industry in this colony, and is carried on
at the now famous Monte Christo mine, owned
by Capt. Rogers. The mine is situated about
4 miles from Bingara township, and on a hill about
600 feet above the Guydir River. The diamond-bearing
gravels have been covered by lava, which still forms the
summit of the Bingara Range, but have been removed by
denudation from the Monte Christo, and other low parts
where most of the diamonds have hitherto been extracted.
The mine has been steadily worked during the year, and
as much as 10} carats of diamonds have been obtained
from gOlbs. of wash-dirt, which also yielded a little gold.
Capital is, however, required to develope the property.
The output of the Bingara district in 1893 is said to have
been 15,000 carats of diamonds, valued at £T5,3<3, or an
average twenty shillings and sixpence per carat. 2U
loads of wash-dirt yielded 2250 diamonds, and from a test
of 401 b of wash-dirt 35 stones vvere obtained, weighing i t
carats. The largest stones in the district range from -to
3 carats.” Diamonds, since the above report was printed,
have been found ranging up to 7J carats. “In 1394, over
£2o.e«) worth of diamonds have been won from tms
.field.'’—(See Australian Gazetteer.)
The Bingara correspondent of the Australian
Mining Standard, writes on May Ist, 1893
“ Having heard that Capt. Rogers, of the Monte Christo
Mine, had completed another enormously rich washing
up, I paid him a visit to satisfy myself of its truthfulness.
I met the Captain of the mine, and he was in great glee
about the result. ‘ Yes,’ he said, in answer to my ques-
tion, ‘ if this mine was in Victoria or any other part of the
world than Bingara, I could get £1,000,000 for it. Before
1 show vou the diamonds, you must come down the mine,
and see where I took out the dirt. To give you a slight
idea of the richness of the mine, I have not blocked out
one foot of dirt; the material was simply taken from the
drives, but in different directions to prove the extent of
wash, and connect the shafts to get fresh air.’ Capt.
Rogers is working on two levels, one 20ft. below the
upper one, he has sent 100 carats of diamonds to
Melbourne, and will this week forward, through the Com-
mercial Bank, 500 carats to Messrs W. Gray and Co.,
Hatton Garden, London, who have at last succeeded in
opening a market for our diamonds. He then showed me
the diamonds. They were a splendid lot, weighing 350
carats, the result of washing of twelve loads of dirt, six
loads taken from the drives from the upper, and six loads
from the drives in the lower levels. Capt. Rogers is not
a young man, and he has done nearly all the work alone ;
he is really a wonder ; and as for the richness of the mine,
the result speaks for itself. The richest diamond mine in
Africa only averages something less than one carat per
load. The result here shows nearly 30 carat per load
Several letters have lately been received from Messrs. W
Gray and Co., Messrs. Streeter, and other leading diamond
merchants of London, in which they say that they have
overcome the difficulty in cutting Bingara diamonds, and
are now prepared to buy any amount of them.
Mr. E. W. Streeter, a well-known English
authority on precious stones, writing to the Field,
says:—
“ He always held the opinion that much undeveloped
wealth in gems exists in Australia. He considers that
Australia may even prove a formidable rival to the better
known regions where gems are found in perfection.
Fifteen vears ago he had predicted that diamonds would
be found in Australia, and recently the owner of a dia-
mond claim washed six loads of diamondiferous earth tot
a yield of 2000 diamonds, though a South African load
rarely produces a carat of small diamonds.
Extract from Report on New South Wales
Diamonds, by Thos. Davies, E. G.S., and R.
Etheridge, jun. (Page B.)
In referring to the quality of the New South Wales
diamonds, a valuable report has been published by Messrs.
Davies and Etheridge, jun., which states The dia-
monds of New South Wales, in their physical characters,
are more nearly allied to those of Brazil than any other
country. They have been very largely sold in London as
such As regards color, they differ practically but little
from’ those of other fields. The general absence of
* cleavage ’ and ‘ macles ’ is a point in their favour.”
Extract from Sydney Telegraph, 18th August,
ig93.
PRECIOUS STONES AT CHICAGO.
Mr. Pittman, Government Geologist, received a letter
from Mr. Jas. E. Carne, Superintendent of N.S.W. Mines
Court at Chicago Exhibition, in which reference is made
to some matters of interest in connection with the
Colony’s exhibits of precious stones. Mr. Carne states that
Mr. S. Bose, of No. 66 East, and 86 Street, New York and
Holland, has been making enquiries with reference to
supplies of rough diamonds, direct from mineholders in
N.S.W. Mr. Bose is a diamond dealer, and specially
interested in carbons, boart, glazier’s diamonds, dia-
mond paints, splints, slabs, and powders, and other
uses for which second-rate and off color stones are suit-
able. A NEW USE HAS BEEN FOUND FOR SMALL DIAMONDS, in
assisting marksmen in their shooting. The cut stones
are fixed in the front and back sights, and it is said that
they enable the gunner to take a quick and correct aim,
even when the light is bad. The brilliants are so fitted
that as soon as the gun is brought to the shoulder, the
rays on the gems assist allignment, and the eye takes aim
without the least hesitation.
Extracts from a report (published in the Even-
ing Standard) on the Bingara Diamond Field by
Mr. G. A. Lawson, Legal Manager, Queen Street,
Melbourne, who made an exhaustive inspection of
a large portion of the field :
“ The tertiary formation consists of two beds of basalt,
with the underlaying gravels and clays. The older basalt
rests on the tertiary clays and river gravels, which contain
the diamonds and other gems. The gravel in which the
diamonds are found is composed of large and small pebbles
mixed with sand. The gem stones are found in the drift.
With the diamonds are sapphires, topaz, rubies, garnets,
opals and tourmaline, also tin and gold. There are besides
these gems small oval and round fragments of rock of
dark color, exactly similar to those found in South African
diamond mines. Up to the present little or no work has
been done upon the field, with the exception of the now
famous Monte Christo mine, also the ground held by a
Melbourne syndicate.
> {On the Monte Christo Mine, which is situated about 300
feet from the top of the Great Dividing Bange, several
shafts have been sunk on the property from 20 to 50 feet
deep, and a tunnel has been driven 180 feet, all proving
the existence of very rich diamondiferous drift. The
present workings consist of a shaft 20 feet deep, and a
drive opened out to the north, exposing to view diamond
drift over 300 feet long, a drive soutli 100 feet, a cross
drive east and west 60 feet; then another cross drive at
the west end of the latter, north and south 30 feet.
Though the whole of the workings are on diamond
drift, there is a layer of about five feet in thickness of
extraordinary richness. I tried a barrow-load from each
of the different drives, and in each instance drove six
inches before taking the dirt, which gave the following
result, viz., 122 diamonds ; a second barrow-load, taken
from all parts of the mine, yielded 146 diamonds, and the
last test of 701 b. weight of drift gave 26 beautiful dia-
monds. As it takes 10 barrow-loads of dirt to the load,
the result is really phenomenal.
Captain Bogers, the owner of the mine, has himself
carried out the whole of the work done on his mine. The
mine is so situated that it clearly proves the future of
tiie FIELD, and that the large diamonds and rich deposits
of gold are under the basalt range. The wash or
drift is dipping under it, and all the geologists who
have visited the field, amongst whom were the
late Rev. W. B. Clark, Mr. C. S. Wilkinson,
and Messrs. W. Anderson and J. A. Coghlan, have said,
‘ You must get under the range to find the real diamond-
bed.’ Captain Rogers was approached as to his disposing
of his mine to a company, and he stated that he would
not accept one cent less than £50,600 cash for it. Mr.
Lawson, in describing the land, which is now the property
o fthe Austral de Beers Syndicate, says: ‘lt lies at a
much lower level than the Monte Christo. Diamonds
have been got in large quantities from this ground by
miners prospecting for gold, but, having no idea of the
value of the gems, they did not trouble about them, and
gave their whole attention to the alluvial gold, which was
very rich in the lower end of the property. The diamonds
found at Bingara are harder and much more brilliant
than the South African diamonds, and are classified on a
par with the best Brazilian diamonds. Some thousands
of diamonds have been got from the field by only a few
individual persons who have been wise enough to keep
their finds to themselves.’ Mr. Lawson states he is
highly pleased with the prospects of the field, which,
with capital judiciously expended, should rival any of the
richest diamond fields of South Africa. The largest
diamond that has yet been found on the field weighed
5i carats. As soon as the field becomes known, and
capital subscribed, there will be room for thousands of
men.” Up to the present time there has not been £6O
worth of machinery at work on the field.
Melbourne Punch of June 18 says :
“ Australian Diamond Mines Proprietary (Bingara,
N.S.W.) expect to start treating the diamondiferous wash
in 14 days’ time. Co. has a great, prospect with 3,000,000
loads of dirt in sight to operate on, and with fair returns
—sayan average of three carats’ worth from 15s. to £1
per carat —the profits should be handsome, for the ground
can be broken and washed for 2s. per load. ' Deepest
workings are yet only some 60 feet, and in the opinion of
many experts the true matrix will be found under 200 or
300 feet. The .£lOO shares are now difficult to obtain
under £3OO, for the stock is strongly held.”
The history of South African diamond mines
shows the large possibilities for wealth open to
Australia by the development of its diamond
fields.
The Strand Magazine of March, 1896, states:
“ Before diamonds were found in South Africa, the arid
land was not worth more than a few' pence per acre. The
homestead that was built over the Kimberley Mine was
bought for less than £B. The Boornintzigt farm, which
included the De Beers Mine, was sold later on for £6OOO,
and was shortly afterwards acquired by the Government
for £lOO,OOO, whereas the property hassince proved to be
worth one hundred million pounds. From four to five
million pounds w'orth of gems have been raised from these
mines in the course of a single year.
“The value of the diamonds raised from the Kimberley
mine alone, during 1883, was nearly £1,000,000 sterling,
whilst the total yield up to 1885 probably exceeded the
value of £20,000,000. According to.the most recent
report of the De Beers Consolidated Company, the result
of the vear’s operations produced a net profit of
£1,692,397.”
The amalgamation of the four diamond mines of Kim-
berley, South Africa, was completed by cheque, paid on a
basis of £16,000,000. One cheque, probably the largest
ever drawn by any commercial concern, was for
£5,460,000, which was the amount paid for the Kimberley
Mine.

A Brisbane publican supplies a good feed

and the regulation “ long-’un ” for 3d. The other

of the cigar. Boniface merely sighed, and said he
couldn’t please everybody. He declares, however,
that he’s going to withdraw the toothpicks, as his

Sydney Daily Telegraph fatuously de-
scribes the “reciprocity” proposals of Maoriland
as an “extension of Freetrade” under a “ dis-
guise.” Reciprocity is a giving and receiving in
return. N.S.W., as a country of free ports, has
nothing to give any other land in return for fiscal
concessions. She may be flooded with M.L. goods
and cannot offer any inducement for M.L. to take
off one farthing duty upon N.S.W. goods. She is
in the same quandary in re the M.L. matter of
reciprocity as is Britain in re the Imperial Zoll-
verein. A Freetrade country, in this respect, is a
naked and unarmed beggar opposed to a mail-clad,
well-armed, strong man.

now vigorously clamoring for a railway on the
strength of its mineral, pastoral, and agricultural
resources —especially the latter. First quest for

No. 1 had nothing but lollies, pumpkins, and

the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. 1 August, 1894.'
Dear Sir,—ln the year of 1871 I was eight days>
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the. joints, and have tried)
all advertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
I had a great difficulty in walking, and went to.
the Turkish baths, which did no good. Passing;
your window I saw a testimonial from Mr. E..
W. O’Sullivan, M.P., with the same complaint asi
I had, which led me to try your Remedies. Om
Thursday before Good Eriday I took the first oft
your Pills ; since then I have used 4 boxes Speeiall
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Speeiall
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline!
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago..
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-
plaint. May you long be spared under God to
be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,
JOHN KEAY.

Palmerston North is the biggest laid-out
town in Maoriland. It’s about as big as Melb.
You may go out ridins- at night, some two or three
miles away from the Post Office, and you suddenly
collide with a lamp-post. This will probably be
the corner of King William and Lord Neville
streets, which you have by mistake taken for a
grass-paddock. Palmerston has just got the gas
laid on, also a consignment of iron lamp-posts,
and these latter are spread around so as to mark
the ‘streets,’ but the only ones lit are those near
the hotels.
There is one direction in which N.S.W.
rules of procedure badly need amending. In
moving for a new trial there is one argument to
show the points taken are arguable. Should the
rule nisi be granted another argument follows to
show they are not only arguable but sound. And
the rule nisi has to be granted when one Judge of
the three sitting is impressed—not with the sound-
ness of the propositions put, forward, but with the
possibility of their being successfully argued.
Result, talk—and fees. One argument should be
sufficient—one fee is often more than enough. In
the case of Equity appeals rules nisi are unknown,
and the whole job is done at one sitting.
When the late Archbishop Groold, of Melb.,
brought the Jesuits to Victoria, he gave them
charge of Kew and Hawthorn, and told them they
would be given four miles beyond every new
church that they built. The Jesuits built churches
on the far-off confines of their territory, took
four miles ahead, and then built a new church;
and so on till they had forged their way to
Oakleigh and Nunawading. When Archbishop
Carr came he confiscated Oakleigh, Camberwell,
and the surrounding country, and gave them ,to
his own secular clergy. The Jesuits arose and
said they’d appeal to Rome. But the case seems
to have been settled out of court, and the secular
clergy hold on to the country seized.

Dear Bulletin : A story with a moral,
whatever the moral may be. Two years ago I
was fossicking with a mate on the Werribee, and
one Saturday we went into Myrniong to sell our
gold and get our week’s stores. After buying
groceries we found ourselves with a surplus of 4s.
wherewith to get meat for the ensuing week.
Both of us remarked simultaneously that 3s.
would be abundant for that purpose and proposed
that we should have a pint of the dubious local
beer with the balance. We had the beer. Then
it seemed to dawn on us unanimously that 25., if
laid out with strict economy, would buy all the
cowsflesh we could possibly want. No one put
this statement into so many words, but we felt it,
and had the other beer in dead silence. I pro-
posed then to buy the meat, but my mate had a
luminous idea. “ Buy a shilling’s-worth of powder
for the old gun,” he said cheerfully, “and I’ll
shoot enough rabbits to keep us going, and we’ll
have another beer, and dash the expense.” We
had another beer. Then I started across the street
to get the powder, but before I was half-way over
my mate had yet another idea even brighter than
the last one. “ I tell you what,” he said joyously,
“ we’ll have another beer and we’ll dig the beggars
out. Dash the powder anyhow. ” We thereupon
had another beer. There was very little meat in
the camp that week. As to the moral, I don’t see
exactly where it comes in, but there is a moral
about somewhere. —Yours, C. O‘D.

Dear Bulletin, —That Chinese footrace re-
minds me of an incident on the Ovens in the early
days. A Chow was caught in the act of robbing
a sluice-box by the night-watchman, and carefully
tied up till morning, when the miners “ rolled-up ”
to determine his fate. Not caring to lose time in
prosecuting him, it was decided to substitute
Lynch-law, and at the same time give the culprit
a chance. The youngest and smartest of the party
(who fancied he could run a bit) was armed with a
stick about 3ft. long, and the prisoner (after being
exercised at the end of his pigtail for about five
minutes to take the stiffness out of him) was
placed just one yard in front. The course was up
the bed of a creek, good going, and the Celestial
ran without plates. The conditions were that the
pursuer was to belt his quarry as long as he could
keep within reach of him. A fair start was
effected, and the stick came down “ Whack ! ” on
th 3 first bound ; but no more, for the bare-footed
C.iow fairly left his field amidst the howls and
cheers of the assembled diggers. The pair dis-
appeared, but only one returned some days later,
bearing every evidence of a howling drunk. He
had a rooted objection to discuss pedastrianism
ever afterwards.— Wombat.

Hebe of Grasstree .
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A change had come over the spirit of Grasstree :
there was a false note in the gaiety of the men np
from Ramrod Flat, and the young fellows in the
pastoral interest around on the Black Cockatoo,
when they foregathered in Cleever’s bar, dis-
covered an unaccustomed awkwardness and re-
straint in their attitudes towards each other.
With miners and bushmen alike confidence had
given place to suspicion, and good-fellowship to
an all-round surliness.
For a time the men could not account even to
themselves for this strange alteration ; an attempt
was made to make the climate responsible, and a
few insisted that it was something in the drink,
but certainly all had become “sudden and quick
in quarrel ” —hats went down and hands went up
on the slightest provocation. Men whose ordi-
nary, work-a-day friendship had previously
heightened to brotherly love under the warming
influence of alcohol now became prof ane and bitter
in drink, and short arguments terminated with a
rush and a collision in the bar. Little differences
that might previously have been settled by mutual
concession were now nursed and coddled till they
grew into hot enmities, and even Foster and
Brierly, once the best of mates, were camping
apart and each working a lone hand at Goat
Creek. , . ..
Eventually Hetty Maconochie was generally
recognised as the disturbing element at the Grass-
tree, but, by tacit agreement, that fact was not
publicly admitted. Possibly a delicate and
chivalrous consideration for “Miss Mack’s ’ sensi-
bilities inspired this polite reticence, but perhaps
it chiefly arose from the shame-facedness of her
worshippers. The man out-back, secretive m
most things personal, will admit any weakness or
wickedness ere confessing to the pangs of un-
requited passion. Hence when Hetty was particu-
larly affable to Stacy on Monday evening in the
bar, and allowed Riverton to monopolise her smiles
on Tuesday evening, Riverton and Stacy fought a
desperate and bloody battle on the Wednesday
afternoon to decide the ownership of a one-eyed
dog which was the local head depot for fleas, and
which really belonged to a third man who, being
public-spirited, waived his claim rather than spoil
sport. Riverton won the dog.
Of course Miss Maconochie was quite conscious
that she had introduced a new element into the
relationship of things at the Grasstree, but,
although exultant in the knowledge that the men
were contending with animal ferocity for her
favor, she appeared always quite oblivious, and
was genial or distant with the discrimination of a
conscientious barmaid. , „
Miss Mack had been sent t<i »he Travellers Rest
from a Melbourne labor-office in response to
Cleever’s order, which specified ‘ ‘ a strapping girl,
not more than 26, to work and assist m bar.
Hetty was “strapping,” and certainly not more
than 26; five feet seven, straight as a lath,
strong, ruddy-cheeked, and possessing a mar-
vellous efflorescence of glorious red hair as fine as
spun silk, coruscant, throwing little, subtle ten-
drils down about her ears, her temples, and her
long white neck. There are many female bamsons.
But Hetty’s power was not wholly in her hair;
her strength was peculiarly attractive to the men ;
her every action suggested strength—strength
underlying a womanly softness and roundness.
She often served in the bar on warm evenings with
her sleeves rolled well above her shapely elbows,
and then Cleever’s patrons felt it was worth the
price of the drink to see “Mack” reach up tor
the bottle. She draped lightly for comfort, and
blushed to find it fame. The average woman wno
puts on much to make herself attractive does not
realise that half the art is in taking off. Hetty
was innocent of coquetry when she divested her-
self of superfluous drapery, but she could not re-
main long ignorant of the advantages she enjoyed
from her emancipation. Then her laugh helped
to ensure success —it was a generous laugh, full ol
suggestive music, and discovered new attractions
in her large, handsome mouth. Such a laugh is
honeyed flattery for the man who provokes it,
and, as Hetty was proud of her fine white teeth,
no man’s joke was altogether a failure in Cleever s
There were other young women in and about
the Grasstree ; two or three in the township, and
settlers’ and farmers’ daughters judiciously dis-
tributed over the district ; but, although these had
been courted, it was in a temperate and bloodless
manner. These girls were not slow m concluding
that Miss Maconochie was a person of extraordi-
nary deceit and peculiar morals, but Hetty was by
no means a designing woman; saving a year
spent in domestic service in an extremely Metho-
dist household in Melbourne, her knowledge of
men and manners had been gathered m the bush
township where she was born and bred. Her
morals were particularly healthy; it was soon
understood by Cleever’s customers that Mack
knew how to take care of herself an understand-
ing that detracted not from the zest of the pursuit.
After the morbid propriety of that Methodist
household, Hetty revelled in the unrestraint and
comparative brilliancy of life at the Travellers
Rest. Cleever was a widower, and not at all
exacting, and in the bar of evenings the girl
received at least a specious show of respect suffi-
ciently gratifying to a young woman of her intel-
lectual limitations. ,
The first battle fell about between Stacey and
one of the Devoys. Both had been dangling over
the bar, chatting and larking with Hetty;, for an
hour or so, when Stacey’s glass was upset m a bit
of horseplay, and Stacey, receiving its contents
over his shirt-front, became a butt and an object
of derision to all in the bar. ‘ Mack laughed
aloud, and flashed her white teeth in the lamp-
light, and Devoy laughed, too, and Stacey s blood
grew hot, and he longed for slaughter. His oppor-
tunity came when the girl left the bar, a minute
later. He confronted Devoy :
ts Damn you, Devoy, you did that on purpose .
It was entirely an accident, but neither was m
any humor for explanations. Devoy felt it was
beneath him to excuse or parley ; he blurted much
defiant profanity. , . ,
“ What if I did ! Why don t you drink up your
liquor like a man ! ” . , ,
He was cut short by a swinging, open-hand
blow. Then thud, thud, thud, thud four quick
blows, two and two, with a sound as of a teamster
banging the ribs of his bogged horses with a
shovel; and Stacey and Devoy were fighting with
the ferocity of tigers at mating-time.
Hetty returned to the bar to see the first blow
struck, and now, leaning over the counter, with
sparkling eyes, glowing cheeks, and heaving
breast, she watched the fight. There was none of
the impassivity of the lolling tigress in her atti-
tude: she burned with excitement; she clenched
her own hands, and bruised her knuckles on the
boards; she followed each swift, cutting blow,
and uttered inarticulate cries of wonder.
The men fought without science, fought with
the brutality of powerful men, wounding with
every blow, but feeling nothing in their heat and
furyl A ring of onlookers circled round them,
and outside this ring danced Cleever —“Fight-
ing” Cleever—with his “peacemaker,” a wicked-
looking waddy, eager to get in a blow and stun
one of the combatants, for the peace of Devil s
End and the credit of the house.
The fight was not settled in Cleever’s bar. I wo
or three rounds served to exhaust the blind fury
of the combatants, and then mutual friends inter-
ceded, and a formal meeting was arranged for
next day. A two hours’ struggle in Had dons
grass paddock on the following afternoon ended
in the defeat of Stacey, and that night Devoy
appeared before Hetty Maconochie, bruised, ban-
daged, and badly hacked about, but big with vic-
tory. The fight was not discussed, but the girl
quite understood, and the conquering hero re-
joiced in her luminous smile, and was sullenly
given the pride of place by his companions, who
tacitly admitted this right to the victor for the
time being.
After that fistic battles were daily occurrences
at Devil’s End. Callaghan, the solitary constable
of the district, made a gallant attempt to cope
with the press of business, but after an exhausting
week yielded to public opinion, and was officially
blind and deaf when the battle-cries were heard
at the Traveller’s Rest. Presently every second
man in the district possessed black eyes, split
lips, or a swollen ear, or all these things, and
the’local chemist did a roaring trade in court-
plasters and Friar’s Balsam. The men fought
on the very slightest provocation, or with
no obvious provocation at all ; arguments on
religion or politics invariably ended in blood-
shed ; mates in the drives below disagreed as to
the proper locality for a “ shot,” and came blas-
pheming up the shafts to “ settle it ” in a ‘ mill ;
the boys at “Old Burgoo’s” fought viciously to
maintain their superiority as horsemen and
shearers, and always the victorious pugilist turned
up at Cleever’s, in all the glory of his wounds and
bruises, to invite the admiration of the creamy-
skinned goddess with the brown eyes.
Grasstree had discovered Hetty Maconochie,
Previously she had received a reasonable amount
of attention from the men with whom she was
thrown in contact, but Grasstree had made her
a sensation —a craze. She gloried and revelled
in her success, and the sense of pride and power it
gave her. Thinking over it through the day, she
laughed with rapturous delight, and felt like a
queen amongst her pans.
Cleever did well these times : there were no
teetotallers left in and about Grasstree, and the
Travellers’ Rest had absorbed all the business of
the district. Being in love with Hetty himself,
Oleever made an effort to dispense with her help
in the bar, and excited an instantaneous revolt.
“Fetch out the girl,” was the general demand.
“ You don’t think we’ve travelled dowq here to
be served by a splay-mouthed Dutchman !”
Cleever was a Swede, but Swedes, Norwegians,
Danes, Belgians, Germans, Austrians, and men of
Holland are all Dutchmen out-back. Other
foreigners are invariably Frenchmen. If Hetty
was not produced on demand, there was no more
drinking but much disorder and many accidents,
and the proprietor was always compelled to yield.
Cleever fought with the rest. He fought without
science or discrimination, and nobody took any
satisfaction from an encounter with the “Dutch-
man.” He never knew when he was beaten, and
had a ridiculous and disconcerting way of resum-
ing the battle, without word or warning, a day, a
week, or a month after being egregiously whipped.
Being a foreigner he did not allow any absurd
sentiment to interfere with his manner °f nghtmg,
and repudiated British prejudices and British
reverence for rule and precedent, and fought with
all his weapons —fists, nails, teeth, and feet, lb ere
was no credit in beating Cleever; he couldnit
fight, but he was always willing to try, and,
although he was considered wildly humorous in
his tantrums, his opponents rarely escaped an in-
jury of some kind or another before the battle was
ended. , ,
After much indiscriminate fighting, in the
course of a couple of months, it was understood
and admitted without argument that t e final
must be contested by Riverton and Devoy. Both
were unbeaten, and each would have done
battle with a raging lion for the love of Hetty
Maconochie. Cleever alone, of all the whipped can-
didates, refused to abandon his hopes of winning
his handsome Hebe, and was quite willing to
“take on” the two last aspirants one after the
other or both together. The other men of Grass-
tree, and Ramrod Flat, and Grecian Bend ad-
mitted themselves “out of it,” and it was quite
understood that the winner of the Riverton-Devoy
contest had only to step up and take possession of
the prize. This view had never been questioned ;
Hetty’s keen interest in the many battles, and her
evident delight in the knowledge that she was tlie
prize in the greatest competition that had ever
shaken an Australian bush township out of its
habitual quietude and lethargy, were taken as
indicating her acquiescence. Certainly both
Devoy and Riverton took it for granted that the
best man of the two was destined to
belle of Grasstree. ■
The great fight came off on a beautiful pitch
under Grecian Bend, on a Tuesday morning, and
half the male population of the district was there
to see. Devoy and Riverton fought because the
latter had ventured before witnesses to assert
his disbelief of the story of Devoy’s great shooting
exploit, a wonderful narrative never before ques-
tioned at Grasstree. The fight was long and stub-.
born. Both men were young, strong, hardened
with toil, active, game as peccaries, six-foot and a
bit, and fighting for an issue that seemed dear as
d.6£tr life.
They fought bare-knuckled and stripped to the
buff. There was no sparring and no vain display;
every blow cut or bruised; and during the first
half-dozen rounds the great, toughened, knubbly
fists were going like sledge-hammers about a busy
forge. After that it was a brutal exhibition of
butchery and endurance. Blood ran freely, dyeing
the combatants and darkening the grass. The
faces of the fighters became unrecognisable, and
after the 13th round neither could see. By this
time half the spectators had sickened and turned
away, and awaited the end at a distance. Devoy
was knocked clean out in the 19th round, and then
Riverton was carried away across three saplings,
a bruised and battered champion, limp as a wet
shirt, but triumphant, and feeling drunk —happily,
jubilantly drunk.
Riverton would have much liked to drag himselt
to the Travellers’ Arms that night, but it was im-
possible. He was helpless next night, and on the
following morning his bunk still held him captive.
But on Friday night, with the assistance of his
mate, he conveyed his battered carcase into
Cleever’s bar. A woeful spectacle was the cham-
pion of Grasstree, but his wounds were glorious.
About a dozen men sat in the bar. Cleever was
in attendance. The hero called for drinks all
round.

“ Where’s ‘ Mack ’ ? ” he asked authoritatively.
The publican had evaded this query from others
for two days in order to create an impression when
the champion appeared. He lingered over it now
as he served the drinks.
“ She have went by de city for de honeymoon,
he said composedly.
“ Wha-at ! ” Riverton sprawled on the counter,
and his bruised face went livid.
, “ While you vas fight Devoy, my lad, she ride

less, and looked about upon his companions, and
saw only blank faces.
Tommy Haynes was the successful storekeeper
of Grasstree, a small, boyish man of 24, slight and
fair, with curls and a complexion. He could easily
stand under Hetty s extended arm. W hilst
others fought and suffered, Haynes courted-
courted pluckily, with kisses, and caresses, and
pretty presents-eourted anr! conquered.
“ Haynes ! ” repeated Riverton, with a linger-
ing, bitter imprecation, “that-that worm. By

At muster last, shearing, on a big N.S.W.
Western station, there was found to be a large de-
ficiency of sheep, which, despite all endeavors,
remained a mystery. About two months after-
wards one of the men noticed some unshorn sheep
in a paddock at the back of the run : they were
the long-lost sheep. For a period of six months a
big paddock containing nearly 1000 sheep had been
actually lost.
Miser Gibson, who died of voluntary
starvation at Geelong, the other day, was born at
St. Helena, the son of one of Napoleon Buona-
parte’s guards. It is an awful thing to be a native
of Nap’s burial-place. Life on that lonesome rock
seems calculated to cut off a man’s sympathies
from humanity at large, and teach him to love
money for its own sake. Anyway, he couldn’t
love cash for the sake of the pleasures it would
buy-at St. Helena. The Geelong miser was no
doubt a penurious misanthrope before he had
arrived at breeches, and The Bulletin ascribes
his miserable decease to the defeat of the French
at Waterloo
Surgeon Sternberg, head of U.S. army
medical staff, finds tiiat blood-serum of a vaccin-
ited calf or monkey confers immunity against
•accination (otherwise the artificial production of
accinia or cow-pox, said cow-pox being the
'■rother of small-pox) in other monkeys. Also,
Unit the blood-serutn from a patient just recovered
tioin small-pox, when injected into a healthy per-
son or beast, will also prevent the introduction of
accine matter causing vaccinia or cow-pox. The
meaning of which is that small-pox is a microbio
iisease ; that small-pox microbes, like other
pathogenic microbes, excrete some matter into the
ulood which is fatal to microbes entering later,
and that hereabouts somewhere is the explanation
why so few who have once had measles, scarlet,
lever, typhoid fever, &c., ever get a second attack.
" The Fourth Fay."
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Would the long night never end—never
end ?
It ended, and day came. The hot, noisy, glar-
ing day—heat, noise, and glare—glare, heat, and
noise.
Would the day never go, with its heat, and its
noise, and that awful glare ?
It went; and night came on once more.
So the long, long night again, and then the hot,
glaring day; and these, and nothing more, for
weeks, and months, and years.
Perhaps, mercifully, he would someday die.
Perhaps.
But the days and nights succeeded one another;
many, many of them. And still he lived.
* * * *
In reality, he had had the fever one week.
Then the door opened, and someone came in.
He knew not whether it were day or night. She
came. And the dark night fled ; and the glaring
day was gone. It might have been that she
brought a fresh, cool, softly-shaded morning with
her.
In any case, he knew that the torture of those
days and nights had passed for ever.
He lay still now and waited.
She had a pile of fresh linen in her arms; and
with deft, quick, gentle hands she changed his
bed—turning him from side to side so skilfully
and tenderly that his fever-racked limbs were
soothed and rested by her touch.
Then she brought water ; the clear, cool water
he had so longed for; and bathed his face and
hands, drying them with soft, fine linen.
And, lastly, she fed him with some delicate
broth—drop by drop at first, understanding (how
did she ?) that his tongue and throat were parched
and sore.
Then she said “ Sleep; ” and so he slept.
He awoke with a curious sense of peace and
security. He knew, before he opened his eyes,
that she would be there.
And she was.
By the light of the faded candle she was care-
fully measuring something into a glass, which she
brought him. He drank it; her arm slipped
under his head. Fresh life seemed to flow into
his veins as he swallowed the cordial ; and he
noticed that she wore a bunch of violets at her
breast, and that her eyes were large and tender.
He lay back on his pillow, and idly watched
her as she moved softly about the room, re-
arranging the light and tidying the little array of
medicine-bottles on the mantlepiece.
Then she seated herself near the candle and
took out her knitting.
Click, click went the needles —click, click.
He watched her hands. They were soft and
white, yet strong, and they matched the full,
rounded, womanly curves of her figure.
And the face matched the figure—a tender,
womanly face. It rested him to watch her as she
sat there in her snowy cap and apron, making that
little click, click with her needles.
Sometimes he dozed—whether for minutes or
hours he knew not—but whenever he awoke she
was always there, either knitting or coming
towards him with something in her kind hands to
help and heal him.
And so the night passed, and morning dawned.
But he no longer dreaded the day—the noise, and
heat, and glare had vanished.
She had taken them all away. Instead, there
were cool, gentle breezes in the carefully-shaded,
green-curtained room.
There was the fragrance of the violets at her
breast, and the music of her softly-rustling skirt.
But for this terrible weakness that rendered
him so helpless, he could have been glad that he
was ill. For the burning fever and the racking
pain were gone. She had taken them, too, away.
* * * *
The doctor came, and he smiled at him.
All was well—for she was there.
But outside the door the doctor shook his head.
“Too late,” he said to the nurse —“too late.”
And when she returned to the room, the clear
depths of her patient eyes were troubled.
* * * *
Day and night she nursed him —day and
night—battling with death for three days and
three nights
In the early dawn of the fourth day he asked
her to raise him up.
“ Dear,” he whispered, “ if only I could live j ”
“Ah! if only .” Her arms were around him.
“ Kiss me,” he murmured.
She kissed him, and from his dying lips came a
few faint words. Her quick ear heard and under-
stood them. And she kept them in her heart for
ever.
So she laid him back on the pillow, and closed
his tired eyes; and then turned her face towards
the window.
The dawn was flushing the east, and its light
fell upon her quiet face. There were lines of pain
about her mouth, and the tender eyes were dim.
But another day had begun; and there was work
to do.
She drew down the blind, and left him—sleep-
ing peacefully—her violets on his breast, and his
words in her heart.

The Northern clergy keep abreast of the
times. The other day a Mackay parson an-
nounced that he would preach on the “ Tick
Fever.” We shall shortly have the clergy deliver-
ing Sabbath discourses on “The Divided Skirt; ”
“ The Age of Consent ” and “ The Generation of
Rabbits in the Baekblocks.”
Every man is entitled to his own philo-
sophy. This is some of mine : —Life is made up
of yesterday and to-morrow; to-morrow is the
happiest day in our lives. Be as bad as you can,
and then moderately good— and your wife will
love you. Some men get on better in one place ;
some in another. I get on best in another. — Joe
Swallow.
Writes a Bulletin correspondent:—“lt
was once thought that the Chinese would only cut
the white bushman out of light work, such as
ring-barking. But it’s a common thing nowadays
to meet camps of Chinese tank-sinkers, drain-
cutters and fencers. “ Who’d ha’ thought thev’d
take to hard graft ? ” Miles of the fencing washed
down by the recent floods in Cobar (N.S.W.)
district are being re-erected by Chinkies. Except
shearing, most bush work is now pretty well in
the hands of Asiatics. Here is a standing advt.
in the Cobar paper :
Important to Squatters and Others.
"RANG FOON is prepared to undertake all contracts
for Fencing', Ring-barking, Scrubcutting on the
most favorable terms. Also Cooks, Laborers, and all
classes of workmen supplied on the shortest notice.
“ On the most favorable terms ! ”
Unequally Yoked.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
She woke at night, and caught her breath
Because the stillness grew so grim.
And cried, for sudden fear of death,
And, crying, slowly wakened him.
“ So quiet and inert you lay,
The terror seized me you were dead.”
“Sleep, dear ! and, sleeping, dream away
The memory of such idle dread.”
“ Idle ! ” —and all her lessoned youth
Rose up in protest at the word ;
The preachings of distorted truth
In droning chapels dimly heard—
“ An idle fear? that unprepared
The soul I love had slipped away,
And far beyond my praying fared
In everlasting hell astray—
“ Ah, husband ! from the careless sleep
To wake aghast, condemned, alone ! ”
“ Say, rather, wife, how glad the leap
To wider powers and more our own !
“ Death is the door to nobler deeds,
New work, that comes as work’s reward:
This creed alone of all the creeds
Frees man from a despotic lord.”
Half-eased', as one that half-believes,
She watched him smiling till he slept:
Then, sighing underneath the eaves,
The night-wind chilled her, and she wept.
And still she murmured “ Love can save
By faith the husband loved so well. ”
And still against her hopes there drave
The fireflakes of the preachers’ hell.
“ Is he not mine, dear God ? ” she said,
“ Bought with my tears, myself, for coin ? ’
But backwards still the grim phrase read :
Whom God hath sundered, none can join.
And faster, heavier than her tears
Doom-threatening thoughts began to flow,
And prophesied through all the years
Immense, unconquerable woe.
So, stretching hopeless hands of love
Across an ever-widening sea—
As boats from shipwreck aimless move,
Then seek to meet, and farther flee—
One with fair dreams of grave delight,
And one with wide, unsleeping eyes,
They tempted all the gloomy night
Unreconciled eternities.

AYER’S
Sarsaparilla
MAKES PURE BLOOD.
Pure blood means health, strength, and happiness. Bad blood means
scrofula pimples, boils, carbuncles, ulcers, tumors, and other dangerous
ailments. Ayer’s Sarsaparilla cleanses, vitalizes, and enriches the blood,
thus imparting renewed life and energy. It cures disease by removing the
cause from the system; it takes away That Tired Feeling, quickens the
appetite, and restores
HEALTH AND STRENGTH
to those who have become enervated by climatic or other influences. Out of
many thousands of testimonials, we have space here only for the following:
Mr. R. Dennis, Adelaide, So. Australia, writes:— “lt is with very much
pleasure that I testify to the great benefit I received from using your
wonderful blood-purifier. I was a sufferer for years from indigestion, loss
of strength and appetite, and constipation. My- whole system seemed to be
thoroughly out of order. A friend finally told me to take Ayer’s Sarsaparilla.
I followed" his advice, though feeling discouraged at the fruitless results of
other treatment, and I am thankful to state that a few bottles completely
cured me.”
Mr. Robert Goodfei/low, Mitcham, So. Australia, writes:—“l have
used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla in my family for years, and would not be without
it. I used to suffer with boils and skin eruptions, attended with great
lassitude and general debility. In fact, I was so ill that I could not attend
to my business. Being advised to try Ayer’s Sarsaparilla I did so, and lam
happy to say that the medicine restored me to perfect health. I have since
used Ayer’s Sarsaparilla for my children, in various complaints, and it lias
always proved effective. I can safely recommend it to sufferers as the best
blood-purifier in existence.”
