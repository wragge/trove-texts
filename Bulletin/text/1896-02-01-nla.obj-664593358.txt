Coventry Patmore.
f , , of-ofpd (which is published price with
On reoeint at The Bulletin Office, Sydney, of Postal Order, Postal Notes, or Stamps (of any province) equal to I , ,
On receipt at Ihe Bulletin
Coventry Patmore is a poet who does not attract
the multitude. Yet his message is singularly
sweet, and for kindred souls he has an irresistible
esharm. Alice Meynell, who has made a selection
from his works which she calls “The Poetry of
Pathos and Delight” (ss. Gd.)—an admirable in-
troduction —declares that “ many poets are heard
because a chorus of contemporaries sings with
them and like them. Mr. Coventry Patmore’s
voice is single in his day, and single in our
literature. It makes part of no choir heard by
numbers, and so it needs an attentive ear. To
that attentive ear it sounds alone, as the divinest
voice of our time. ”
* * * *
Endorsement of this appreciation is plainly a
question of mood and temperament. The three
extracts which follow —chosen mainly for brevity
• —may help unacquainted readers to decide how
far they can follow the eulogist.
THE LOVER.
He meets, by heavenly chanoe oppress,
The destined maid ; some hidden hand
Unveils to him that loveliness
Which others cannot understand.
His merits in her presence grow,
To match the promise in her eyes,
And round her happy footsteps blow
The authentic airs of Paradise.
For joy of her he cannot sleep ;
Her beauty haunts him all the night;
It melts his heart, it makes him weep
For wonder, worship, and delight.
O, paradox of love, he longs,
Most humble when he most aspires.
To suffer scorn and cruel wrongs
From her he honors and desires.
Her graces make him rich, and ask
No guerdon ; this imperial style
Affronts him ; he disdains to bask,
The pensioner of her.priceless smile.
He prays for some hard thing to do,
Some work of fame and labor immense,
To stretch the languid bulk and thew
Of love’s fresh-born magnipotenee.
No smallest boon were bought too dear,
Though barter’d for his love-sickJife ,
Yet trusts he, with undaunted cheer,
To vanquish heaven, and call her Wife.
He notes how queens of sweetness still
Neglect their crowns, and stoop to mate ;
How, self-consign’d with lavish will,
They ask but love proportionate ;
How swift pursuit by small degrees,
Love’s tactic, works like miracle ;
How valour, clothed in courtesies,
Brings down the haughtiest citadel;
And therefore, though he merits not
To kiss the braid upon her skirt,
His hope, discouraged ne’er a jot,
Out-soars all possible desert.
THE SPIRIT’S EPOCHS.
Not in the crises of events,
Of compass’d hopes, or fears fulfill’d,
Or acts of gravest consequence,
Are life’s delight and depth reveal’d.
The day of days was not the day ;
That went before or was postponed;
The night Death took our lamp away
Was not the night on which we groan’d.
I drew my bride, beneath the moon,
Across my threshold ; happy hour !
But, ah, the walk that afternoon
We saw the water-flags in flower !
THE TOYS.
My little son, who look’d from thoughtful eyes,
And moved and spoke in quiet crown-up wise,
Having my law the seventh time disobey’d,
I struck him, and dismiss’d
With hard words and unkiss’d,
His Mother, who was patient, being dead.
Then, fearing lest his grief should hinder sleep,
I visited his bed.
But found him slumbering deep,
With darken’d eyelids, and their lashes yet
From his late sobbing wet.
And I, with moan,
Kissing away his tears, left others of my own ;
For, on a table, drawn beside his head,
He had put, within his reach,
A box of counters, and a’red-vein’d stone,
A piece of glass abraded by the'beach
And six or seven shells,
A bottle with blue-bells,
And two French copper coins, rang’d there with
careful art,
To comfort his sad heart.
So when that might I pray’d
To God, I wept, and sard :
Ah, when at last we lie with financed breath,
Not vexing- Thee in death,
And Thou rememberest of what toys
We made our joys,
How weakly understood
Tliy great commanded good,
Then fatheifly, not less
Than I whom ’lhoffihast moulded from the slay,
Thou’lt leave Thy wrath, and say,
I will be sorry for their ehdldishness.
Notes.
Marriott Watson says the just word of criticism
in a Bookman notice of William Watson’s new
poems:—
The eloquence of his melodies is almost the most per-
suasive part of his high talents. . . . The “ Hymn
to the Sea ” impresses one rather as a dignified and beau-
tiful exercise than as a real achievement. It is not the
offering of a faithful worshipper; it is the compliment of
a polite stranger.
Watson is not a lyric poet at all, says Watson.
Here is the only poem in the new volume to set
against this judgment:—
Oh, like a queen’s her happy tread,
And like a queen’s her golden head 1
But, oh, at last, when all is said,
Her woman’s heart for me 1
We wandered where the river gleamed
’Neath oaks that mused and pines that dreamed
A wild thing of the woods she seemed,
So proud, and pure, and free !
All heaven drew nigh to hear her sing,
When from her lips her soul took wing;
The oaks forgot their pondering,
The pines their reverie.
And, oh, her happy, queenly tread 1
And, oh, her queenly golden head 1
But, oh, her heart, when all is said,
Her woman’s heart for me !
Yet even here the beauty is rather of sound and
form than of spirit. As, perhaps, in this delicious
sonnet: —
I think you never were of earthly frame,
O truant from some charmed world unknown 1
A fairy empress, you forsook your throne,
Fled your inviolate court, and hither came ;
Donned mortal venture ; wore a woman’s name ,
Like a mere woman, loved ; and so are grown
At last a little human, save alone
For the wild elvish heart not Love could tame.
And one day I believe you whl return
To your far isle amid the enchanted sea, —
There, in your realm, perhaps remember me,
Perhaps forget: but I shall never learn 1
I, loveless dust within a dreamless urn,
Dead to your beauty's immortality.
His recently-published “ Letters ” show that
Matthew Arnold considered Swinburne verbose,
Carlyle’s message superfluous, Macaulay intellec-
tually vulgar, Tennyson, “with all his tempera-
ment and artistic skill, deficient in intellectual
power. ” Thackeray he did not think a great
writer. Some suggestion here —and a trifle of
acidity for a quietist philosopher ?
“ ‘ Beside the Bonnie Brier Bush,’ ” says a critic,
“ga*ve us the first-day-in-the-week Drumtochty;
in ‘ The Days of Auld Lang Syne ’ we have the
parish as it is six days in seven. ”
Henry Lawson’s “ In the Days when the World
was Wide, and Other Verses,” including all his
best Bulletin pieces, will be ready next week.

\Vm. Watson’s new poems (with a fine portrait
of the author) cover some 05 pages of print, at
an average of perhaps 14 lines to a page, and the
price is 3s. 6d. nett (4s. 3d. posted). To people
who like quantity for their money, this will seem
poor value. With a publisher's catalogue thrown
in, the small Bvo. volume is not half-an-inch thick.
Certes, the new poets know how to make profits.
Mr. W tson’s work must now be sought in eight
volumes ; and the whole could probably be packed
into the space of a single Shakespeare play.
David Blair’s two daughters have on the stocks
what is described as a very outr6 book.
Angus and Robertson are to publish in their
Australian series Dyson’s “ Rhymes from the
Mines and other Lines ” —mostly from The Bul-
letin.
Alexander Sutherland, of Melbourne—a more-
or-less historian, humourist, poet, and many other
things—has just finished an elaborate work on the
“Development of Ethics.” Much of it was
discussed with Henry Gyles Turner —an authority
on commercial ethics, certainly.
Pierre Cassee : One verse will show your parody’s
quality :
Now wades the dingo in the glimmering tank,
And all the solemn scrub seems locked in sleep,
Save where that bullock-bell goes clonk urn -clank,
And blended bleatings mark the drinking sheep.
Maoriland booksellers—ower Scotch and canny ?
—order “ The Banjo’s ” poems in twos and threes,
while one admirer writes from Rangitata
that “*had I had 20 copies I could have sold them
on this and adjoining stations ; and only yester-
day I was offered 10s. for my own copy.” Where-
fore would-be Maoriland readers are counselled to
order direct from The Bulletin Book Exchange.
By the way, £2 2s. is already offered for the large
paper edition, which was sold out immediately on
publication. The first sheets of Lawson’s poems,
also to be issued next week by Angus and Robert-
son, "justify the prediction that his success will be
equally great.
Recent Publicotions.
Justin McCarthy described George Eliot’s
“ Spanish Gipsy ” as the clever attempt of a
woman of genius who is not a poet to write poetry.
Edward Arnold’s “Light of Asia ” is the similar
attempt of a man of talent. It has two or three
effective passages, but is chiefly interesting tor
the view it gives of Buddhist philosophy, ine
new cheap edition (2s. Gd.) is illustrated, and
prettily issued.
A remarkably cheap book is the reprint of
Lane’s “ Arabian Nights ” (3s. 3d.), well bound
and printed, and running to 400 large Bvo. pages.
There are some omissions, but no expurgations,
and “ Ali Baba ” and “ Aladdin ” are added from
another source.
Lady Cook is a laborious New Woman who
writes with zest on sex -questions. Cnee an
energetic American girl (Tennessee C. Clafun !)
she yoked an English baronet to her conquering
car, and he sweats at her bidding for the regenera-
tion of Monstrous Man. Gordon and Gotch are
agents for the Lady’s third series of essays (9d.),
which are attractively compounded of sound sense
and sound nonsense.
Aimee Fabregue’s “ Crucifix ”-—the love-idyll of
a leper—i« in the original a clever study in delicate
emotional prose. I). Havelock Fisher's transla-
tion (Is. ?W.) —the second volume of the Towei
Cosmopolitan Library—is uncommonly well done.
Racey Schlank’s “ poems ”•—an Adelaide publi-
cation —are crude and commonplace enough, but
hint of coming capacity to do much bettor work.
The reprint of Langbridge’s “Poets, at Play”
(4s. Gd.) gives in cheap form one of the best collec-
tions of humorous verse in the language. It con-
tains not only the stock pieces, but many out-of-
the-way and admirable items, and many from
recent writers.
“The Stolen Bacillus ” (35., 45.), H. G. Wells’s
collection of rei>rinted short stories, shows the
scientific bent of the author of “ The Time
Machine.” The motives and treatment are fresh,
and there is—O marvel! —not a woman in the
bookful. Generally the fancies lack substance—
rarely interest.
Stanley Weyman seems to have found the limit
of his literary tether. His new work, “ The Red
Cockade” (.'is., 45.) maintains his standard—no
less and no more. Certainly, no one nowadays
has a better knack of historical narrative, or a
greater talent to invent and handle incident.
Given a little humor, a little pathos, a little emo-
tional strength, and Weyman might rank as a
classic. As it is, he tells a very interesting story.
“The Red Cockade” deals with the beginnings of
the French Revolution, and the hero is rather
less monotonously lucky than “A Gentleman of
France. ” However, he has desert enough to win
his fate in the shape of the shrinking yet spirited
<young lady who is Weyman’s stock female charac-
ter. The book is readable.
Grant Allen’s “British Barbarians” (4s. 6d.)
seems to plagiarise “ The Wonderful Visit ” idea
and spoil it for lack of humor. A young man
from the 25th century is made the medium for
expounding Mr. Allen’s now-familiar “ views ” on
sex-questions. The exposition is dull.
Periodicals.
The Album changes its issue from weeWy to
monthly. With the handsome Xmas No. (Is. 6d.)
comes a set of beautiful illustrations of orchids.
Percy Spence cleverly illustrates a story in the
second number of the Ludgate Magazine (new
series, Is. 6d.). A wealth of fine engravings dis-
tinguishes this magazine.
Dr G. L. Mullins, of Sydney, has a striking
article on “Cancer in N.S. Wales” m the Jan.
Aust. Medical Gazette. His generalisations
are interesting, though the period covered by his
statistics is too brief to make their foundation
certain. He claims to have already shown that
the Australasian-born population is not subject to
phthisis, at any rate in Queensland and Maori-
land ; ” and he is now led by a comparison of the
birthplaces of cancer victims to believe that
“cancer is not a prevalent disease among native-
born Australians.” His other conclusions are
1. Although New South Wales has one of the lowest
death-rates in the world from cancer, the disease is
undoubtedly increasing in the colony.
2. The cancer age is from 35 yearn upwards.
3. Cancer is slightly more prevalent among males than
among females. The proportion is as 1-035 to 1.
4. The deaths from cancer occur chiefly among natives
of Great Detain and Germany.
5. Climate appears to have little or no effect on the
production of the disease.
. The stomach is the organ most affected in males, the
uterus in females. The stomach is largely affected in
females.
/. Heredity is the chief cause of the production of
canctr. Chronic irritation is an important factor,
but its true significance ( i.e ., whether it can originate
cancer per se) is still a matter of dispute. _ Meat-
eating, alcohol, or tea-drinking, tobacco-smoking, &c.,
are not primary causes of cancer.
Conan Doyle’s new story, “ Rodney Stone,” the
scene of which is laid in England at the beginning
of the century, will first appear serially in the
Strand Magazine.
Stead announces that his Review Xmas No. —
“Blastus, the King’s Chamberlain is the first
of a series of similar annuals. It is tedious
enough to suit the stolid middle-class mind mar-
vellously. Key-romances want a dexterous hand
to be readable beyond their little circle, and Stead,
who is insufferably dull when he preaches, now
preaches continually. Yet he was a brig 1 t
journalist once. (It seems a long time ago.)
There is something in this, from the Speaker :
Whatever the newspapers may say, the peoples of
Europe hate the idea of war with a holy intensity of pur-
pose. If war should come, it will be the fault not of tl.o
nations but of journalists, diplomatists and statesmen.
“Last summer,” writes Paul Bourget in
“ Outre-Mer,” “I was passing through
Beverly, near Boston, at the time of the
death of one of the most distinguished officers
of the Federal Army. The corpse was to be
carried to Baltimore, and a funeral service
was first celebrated in the little village
church. In the midst of the ceremony a
young man entered, drew near to the coffin,
gently raised the pall, tapped the lid with
his finger, and said softly, ‘ Steel, not wood.’
Then he disappeared, in the midst of uni-
versal surprise ; it was a reporter.”

v*jRLL) BY Hearne s Bronchitis Cure.
Those who have taken this medicine are amazed
at its wonderful influence. Sufferers from any
form of bronchitis, distressing cough, difficulty of
breathing, hoarseness, pain or soreness in the
chest, experience delightful and immediate relief,
and to those who are subject to colds on the chest;
it is invaluable, as it effects a complete cure. It
is most comforting in allaying tickling and irrita-
tion in the throat, and giving strength to the voice,
and it never allows a cough or asthma to become
No house should be without it, as, taken
at the beginning, a dose is generally sufficient,
and a complete cure is certain.
Mr. W. G. HEARNE.—Dear Sir, —Your medicine has
cured me of bronchitis and asthma, from which I suffered
°! Be r n yea,B ’ durin K which period I was
Z cou>rhs ' and frequently the diffi-
culty or breathing was so distressing that for nights in
™” ! ! l0n 1 had t 0 sit up. I write you this acknowiedg-
ment from a sense of duty, as in my case every other
treatment had failed. For a year previous I hid been
getting very much worse, and at the time I obtained your
medicine I was confined to bed suffering from a most
IJ. 0 J?" fc r h° U k ' «l*°torating Wood and matter, and
apparently beyond hope of recovery. The first dose of
the medicine gave me welcome relief, and I steadily
improved as I continued the treatment, unlil I he< ame.
as I am now quite well.—Yours sincerely, H. WALKER
Balmain, Sydney." ’
“ My son, six years old, had bronchitis for 12 months.
The noise in throat and along back of lungs, and the
cough, caused me great anxiety. I tried several treat-
ments. Cough mixtures and poultices were used and
plasters were applied to the hack and chest without
success.
“ I bought a large-size bottle of Hearne’s Bronchitis
Cure, and after my boy had taken this medicine for about
10 days he was perfectly cured.—J. PATTERSON,
Solicitor, Taimvorth, N.S.W.”
We, the undersigned, have had occasion to obtain
Hearne s Bronchitis Cure, and we certify that it is per-

THE HAIRY MAN OF KOORAWTHA.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
There iow beneath whose savage scowl the
low land cowers m craven dread
A fierce black ridge that nature seemed to have
wu f °rmed ln a furious whim,
Where gibbers grey through the scrub show bare
a au Wart ? and wens on a woolly head
And th S P nned shepherds in bygone days as
a a 11 ,unt . a monster grim.
And all whom evil chance allowed that being’s
shape to scan 6
With white and shuddering lips avowed ’twas—
ugh ! —just like a man !
Well, years had passed in a hum-drum way since
vrri last been seen of men,
hen Mick Mulleary came along in search of a
vacant block,
And coolly put in his corner peg within a mile of
the monster s den
Quit * Pi irp J-i ndeed t 0 have dropped upon such
f( T a splendid run for stock.
if 1 must choose betwane yahoos and settlers’
tt ; sheep, said he,
‘ I’ll take my chance wid the hairy men,” and he
chuckled with churlish glee.
So he settled down like a pioneer and was well
content as a bear might be
ill he took a fit in the field one day at. the
sound of a splitter’s axe,
And he growled to his wife as he rallied to, “ Is
there no law for the like of me ?
Be the powers of war I’ll make him shift in
less than a brace o’ cracks.
I here s the rabbit-pest and all the rest of the
plagues we’ve got to face,
But there’s divil a nuisance among them all to
aiqual the human race.”
I hen he rigged himself from scalp to toe in a
a suit of dingo-skins
And stole away to the mountain side while
«rs muttering in undertone,
Oonsarnin’ that splitter beyant,” said he “if
he s annyways frisky about his pins ’
111 make him clare out of camp as fast as the
divil wmt out of Athlone.
And thin, maybe, they’ll lave me free whin they
hnd, as sure as they will,
d here are rale yahoos and bunyips and things
around Koorawatha still.
“ But hould on now; is it mad ye are that ye’ve no
regard for a loaded gun ?
Fwhat a splendid mark for a sportsman ! Och !
the saints be kind this day J ” .
He stood aghast, for fair in front was the thing
itself— the hairy one —
There, peering over a clump of rock not twenty
yards away, J
In nasty truth a face uncouth—all nose and mouth
and ears,
And a straggling beard like stringy-bark, and hair
all spikes and spears.
Limp as a rag with awful fright Mick felt just
then he’d lost his legs,
But soon re-action braced him tight and gave
him wings instead ;
And nearing home he came upon his wife on the
hunt for turkey-eggs,
Who, unaware of his wild disguise, let out a
screech and fled.
He chased her straight through the cow-yard gate
mid a racket of terrified howls
I rom freckled young savages, mixed with the yelps
of curs and the cackle of fowls.
Time kills romance. A candidate drove up one
day to Mulleary’s gate
And sought with greasy smile and speech a solid
vote to score,
But Mick could only gape and stare, for in the trap
before him there
Was the very face he’d seen amongst the rocks
three years before.
At length, in pique at non-success, the face began
to sneer.
“No doubt,” said he, “you hit it well among
your neighbors here,
Although a passing glimpse of one was quite
enough for me;
But p rhaps he was a friend of yours, a relative
may be ? ”
“It’s not the hairy-man,” said Mick, “ye need be
afther fearin’
As I belave he s had a shave— and gone elec-
tioneerin’. ”

BOULIA ON SYDNEY.
Oh, I’ve been there ! You needn’t skite ;
I’ve been in Sydney !
Boulia for me—a town that’s quite
Another kidney.
In Sydney you must wear a coat,
And also collars;
In Boulia you can “act the goat,
If you’ve the dollars ;
Can strip stark-naked if you like,
And black your hide,
And even ask the landlord, Ike,
To “come outside.”
There’s not a pub. in all your town
Where, calm and peaceful,
A Western man can settle down
To fill his fleece full.
Your coppers, cabs, and ways all rile—
Act like a blister :
I loathe your darned soft-soapy style—
Your “sir’’and “mister”;
And rushing crowds, who hurry so
Their various courses.
Why don’t the white-faced beggars go
And catch their horses ?
The thousand shops, the miles of streets
In your “ big smokes ”
Sicken one like a box of sweets
Or “Book of Jokes.”
So many women, too, I say,
Are almost hateful—
It takes one’s appetite away,
Too big a plateful;
Against ’em all I’d any day
Back red-haired Julia,
And, blow of Sydney as you may,
I’d rather Boulia.

A Matter for State Interference.
Bather more than two years have passed
since the great bank-reconstruction epoch,
and the results, so far, have been by no
means up to expectation. Out of the 12
banks of issue which resurrected themselves
on that memorable occasion only two have
since released their deposits in full, and
resumed business on a thoroughly sound
footing. One of the 12 is now dead, and is
going through the process of “ revelations”
which follow decease in such cases. Another
has reconstructed a second time, and, having
obtained large concessions from its creditors,
it looks as if it might ultimately get through;
and a fifth is trying to do a second recon-
struction, though it is too early yet to form
any definite opinion as to its prospects of
success. Of the remaining seven, three are
regarded as safe, and the ultimate fate of the
other four, and of one or two little institu-
tions not included in the 12, is still more or
less uncertain. The shares of at least five
out of eleven survivors are almost wholly
unsaleable, and in three cases it would
probably be necessary to pay a handsome
sum to get them taken away. In one or two
cases things are growing so much worse that
the only apparent alternatives are more
smash or more reconstruction. And, as the
British depositor has not shown himself of late
in a very friendly mood, there is at least as
much chance that the end will be one thing
as the other. Under these conditions, cer-
tain of the Australian Governments should
consider whether it isn’t advisable to do
something, or prepare in good time to do
something as soon as it may be wanted, to
meet the danger. This suggestion is not
made in the interests of the managers and
directors, whose doings in many cases may
thereby escape the exposure they deserve.
Nor is it advanced in the interests of the
shareholders, whose speculations are strictly
their own private funeral; nor in the inte-
rests of the British depositor, about whom
The Bulletin cares very little ; nor even in
those of the Australian depositor. But another
bank crisis, even on a very small scale, would
mean more industrial paralysis, and much
indirect injury to thousands of people who
never had any connection with any bank
whatever, and in their interests there is fair
excuse for State interference.
* * * *
At the time of the 1893 re-construction,
some of the banks had already sunk their
capital and reserve-fund, and part of their
deposits, in investments where the principal
was doubtful, and the interest very doubtful
indeed. They reconstructed partly in the
hope that many of these bad investments
might become good again through a general
revival ; partly with the idea that they might
accumulate profits with which to gradually
wipe off their losses ; partly, it may be, to
get time to cover up some of the more
hideous evidences of their mismanagement
and make the revelations rather less awful
when they had to come ; partly to get time
to die in peace ; and mostly, it would seem,
on the general principle that it is always
good to postpone the calamity as long as
possible. Also, there was the hope, which
is never wholly abandoned, that even in the
most dreadful situation something may
“turn up.” But nothing did turn up for
those who most needed it. The doubtful
investments in most cases went bad, and in
the persistent depression many of those
which seemed good became doubtful, or
worse. Interest dropped instead of rising,
and the bank that had lost or locked up its
capital and reserves and part of its deposit
money, and could only invest what cash it
had left with difficulty, at low interest,
and yet had to pay high interest to its
depositors, found itself in a bad way.
Dividends stopped in many instances. The
earnings, even if they were all earned, were
barely sufficient in the worst cases to pay
working expenses and interest, and there
was practically nothing left with which to
write off past losses and prepare for future
repayments. The situation, in several in-
stances, is decidedly worse than it was in
1893, and there is serious danger that it may
become worse still unless something is done
to improve it very shortly.
* * * *
The only visible remedy lies in obtaining
a large reduction in the rate of interest on
the old fixed deposits. The interest is un-
doubtedly much too high under ordinary
conditions, but it was made high because the
security was decidedly low. And now the
banks which most need assistance can only
ask for a reduction on the ground that the
security is a great deal lower than it was
before. The case which they have to present
is something like this : ‘ ‘ The security which
we have to offer is much worse than hitherto.
The return of prosperity which we promised
hasn’t come, and for the present doesn’t look
at all like coming. You gave us a certain
amount of consideration before on our as-
surance that we could pay up principal
and interest with ease, and our assurance
proved to be wholly unreliable. We
now offer you our equally valuable
assurance that if you give us more con-
sideration we can pay up in full.” That
is the sort of case which any bank that wants
further re-construction has to lay before its
creditors, and the result, in England-at all
events, would almost certainly be a demand
for a complete and independent investiga-
tion of the accounts, which is the one thing
that is not wanted at present. So far as
common report goes, there are now several
Australasian banks which, with time and a
reduction of their interest-burden and no
dreadful revelations to burst up whatever
confidence remains, may get through all right
in the vend with decently honest manage-
ment, but even mild revelations just now
would probably mean panic, and panic would
mean a sudden end of everything.
* * * *
The most promising road out of the diffi-
culty which seems to be coming is by Govern-
ment interference, but on a much wiser plan
than that pursued by the Seddon Ministry
in the case of the Bank of New Zealand. If
the Government offered 2\ per cent. State
debentures in lieu of the present 4| per cent,
deposits they would, The Bulletin believes,
be gladly accepted, the increased security far
more than compensating for the reduced
interest. It would then have to guarantee
the security of all other deposits and
take over the management of the concern
until all its obligations were met in full.
If it charged the bank 2f per cent, it would
get a considerable sum per annum out of the
transaction towards covering its risk. The
enormous saving in interest would provide the
bank with a decent annual revenue, and, as
the State management would pay no divi-
dends to shareholders until all liabilities
were provided for, the whole net revenue
would go towards writing off past losses.
Moreover, the existence of a State guarantee
would make a panic and a consequent run on
the bank’s resources practically impossible,
therefore some of the present cash reserves
could either be invested in revenue-pro-
ducing securities or employed to pay off part
of the existing liabilities, and thus reduce the
interest oharges. The State could incur no
risk until the entire capital had been ex-
hausted and had proved insufficient to cover
losses, and even then it should be possible
for a concern which paid no dividends and
obtained its deposits at a minimum rate of
interest to gradually accumulate profits to
fill the gap. Even a rotten bank with
a State guarantee behind it could do
a large and profitable business, and might
slowly work itself back to a condition of sol-
vency. A rotten bank, in private hands,
is doomed just as soon as the public becomes
aware of its rottenness ; under the control of
a decently honest Government its original
condition would matter nothing at all so long
as the State guarantee held together. Ite
State could even put the management anc
the directorate in gaol without destroying
the bank’s credit —which no body of private
shareholders could do.
* * *
It would probably be a work of many
years to put some of the existing institutions
on an absolutely solid basis, but to the State
years matter very little — it goes on prac-
tically for ever, and it has all the time there
is in which to do the work. M liether in the
end the institutions thus treated became
public property and were amalgamated into
a State Bank, or whether they were handed
back to the control of the shareholders when
the work of rehabilitation was complete, is no
part of the present argument. There are at
least eight good reasons why no more Aus-
tralian banks of issue, good, bad, or indiffer-
ent, should be allowed to go into liquidation
for want of State interference. Australia
cannot stand any more financial collapses at
present ; it will take it many years to recover
from the amount of collapse it has
already got. It can’t stand having any more
huge masses of property thrown upon the
market at a time when a good part of the
continent is already for sale or to let unfur-
nished. It is weary of liquidation, which is
the slowest, saddest, and most costly .agony
yet invented. A banking crisis means the
bursting up of industries, widespread bank-
ruptcy, and general loss of employment, and
the unemployed difficulty is much too severe
already. The State can avert these things at
hardly any risk, and what risk there is will
be more than covered by the gain to the
public revenue, which always falls off woe-
fully in the presence of any great financial
disaster. It can also, by giving the support
of its credit, reduce considerably the exorbi-
tant interest which this country is paying to
English depositors, and the mere fact of
familiarising the British public with 2|- per
cent. Australian securities may help along
the next loan-conversion materially. And
further, there is every reason why the State
should do its best to keep Australian banks
afloat in order to prevent English institutions
getting a larger lien on the business of this
country than they already possess. Also,
there is a prospect of earning the gratitude
of a great many people, with a view to the
next general election, and of finding billets
for some deserving politicians, and various
other things.
* * * *
Even if the interference of the Seddon
Government in the case of the Bank of New
Zealand should prove none too successful,
that has no possible bearing on the scheme
herein outlined. In the matter of the
B.N.Z. the Government interference did not
procure any reduction in the rate of interest
payable on deposits, and that part of the
heavy load was not diminished one iota.
And, on top of this, the bank’s burden was
increased by the borrowing of £2,000,000 at
the ridiculously high rate of 4 per cent.,
which, considering that the State could easily
procure money at 3|, was a hopeless piece
of mismanagement. Therefore, the net
result of the State’s interference was that an
additional liability of £BO,OOO a year was
piled up on the already tottering bank ; that
the country assumed the responsibility of it;
and that it gave the bank’s creditors what
was practically a guarantee of all liabili-
ties without exacting any concessions in
the shape of reduced interest in return
for this greatly improved security. The
Bulletin’s idea is that the Australasian
Governments, where State support is neces-
sary, should exact the full price of the addi-
tional security, and the money thus saved
should be applied towards wiping out old
losses and putting affairs once more on a
sound footing—which is a wholly different
thing. Only a very strong bank could stand
much of the kind of support given by the
Seddon Government.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Voice of Parsons.
The very latest story which is going the rounds
of Australia, as a proof that this country should
walk cheerfully and without fear of danger into
the Japanese treaty, is that of one J. L. Par-
sons, of South Australia, who has lately
returned from a visit to the Land of the
Chrysanthemum. There will be no influx of
Japanese into Australia, says Parsons, because
the Japanese are not an emigrating race.
“ The Japanese can come to Australia now, but they do
not and will not in any large numbers. It is much to be
hoped that the decision with regard to South Australia
connng under the provisions of the Imperial treaty will
not be clouded by any bogus representations about
Japanese swarming into Australia. In my opinion there
is absolutely no need to fear that any such thin- will
happen.” &
This is the comforting sort of bosh which is
based on the theory that what has not hap-
pened in the past can’t possibly happen in the
future—in other words, Jamieson couldn’t
have invaded the Transvaal in ’95 because he
hadn’t invaded it in any previous year The
Japanese, as Parsons truly observes, can come
freely to Australia now, and they haven’t over-
run the country up-to-date ; therefore he
argues, it is quite safe for Australia to'give
away her present right of exclusion and bind
herself to let them come in freely for
ever. The obvious fact is that they
haven t come in any great numbers in
the past because there was no direct line
of steamers to bring them, and because for
want of means of communication, they knew
next to nothing about this country. In other
words, the Japs, didn’t come to Australia in
any very great numbers prior to, say 1895 for
the same reason that the Brit.sh didn’t come
before 1786—because they had hardly heard
about the place and couldn’t conveniently get
there The fact that the British didn t rush
Australia before 1786 is just as much a proof
that they haven’t come here since as the com-
parative absence of the Japanese m the past is
that they will always remain absent. Also,
the fact that there were practically no Italians
in Argentina 25 years ago, despite the fact that
they might have come there any time in the
previous two centuries, proves by the same
process of logic that there are none there now,
vet the Italians are fast becoming the dominant
race in the River Plate republic. And another
development of Parsons’ line of argument
proves that there is no British population in
the Transvaal, because there was none a while
ago; and that the Japanese haven’t raided
Hawaii in great numbers because the Jap. was
a stranger there until very recently ; and that
there are no English in England, for they hadn’t
come there in all the ages from the begin-
ning of the world until about 1500 years
ago ; and that the Spanish race is not in
South America, and that nobody is anywhere
unless he came there so far back that history
doesn’t record a period when he wasn’t there.
All which things are interesting as well as
logical. And, to follow out Parsons’ line of
argument, if the Japanese man doesn’t want to
come to Australia then there is no reason why
this country should sign a treaty giving him
special and extraordinary facilities for coming,
since the treaty would be of no use to him.
And if he is specially anxious to get that treaty,
then the natural assumption is that he does
intend coming. If anyone asked Parsons to
sign a deed by which he was authorised to
jump on Parsons’ head without legal conse-
quences, and assigned as a reason for Parsons
signing it that he wouldn’t make use of the
permission if granted, that gentleman would
probably see the point of the matter. His
natural reply would be that if the other man
didn’t mean to use the power he was quite as
well without it, and if he did intend using it
he ought not to have it. Which is the Japanese
case exactly.
Wanted, a Boom.
It is characteristic of the fact that the public
never really learns anything, that the Victorians
are now craving for a gold-boom with a very
great crave indeed. The province hasn’t yet
anything like recovered from its land-boom,
and it wants, if possible, to have another great
glare and smash on top of its present disasters.
Victoria, as the Age and other papers point
out in mournful tones, is producing three times
as much gold as Westralia, its yield is increas-
ing faster, its recent Gippsland finds are more
sensational than anything recently discovered
in the West; yet there is no boom, no inrush of
British capital, no big companies being floated
in London—nothing ! And Victoria ought to
be truly thankful for it, but isn’t. Because
the southern province has no boom, its recent
gold discoveries mostly go to enrich, in a mode-
rate way, a large number of individual diggers.
None of them make a big pile, with which they
can clear out of the country on a large scale,
and go to move in British sassiety and become
K.C.M.G.’s, but a lot of them make enough
to live comfortably, and distribute a
good deal of new-found gold among local
tailors, grocers, bootmakers, grog-dealers,
and other deserving and undeserving persons.
Also, they make enough in many instances
to pay some local firm to put up crush-
ing machinery, and thereby find work and
wages for some more people who want it badly ;
and their efforts are slowly opening up new
districts, and helping along various depressed
backblocks towns, and the result is that a little
more money is getting into the shire treasuries,
and a few more men find work in making roads
in the new gold districts, and these men
support more tradespeople, and so on ad
infinitum. There is no wild dazzle about the
movement, and consequently there is no big
burst looming at the end of it. If the British
boom that the Melbourne papers want so badly
were to come things would be very different.
The finder of a sensational little patch wouldn’t
take out the gold and spend it locally; he
would rush off to England with his find and
sell it in London for .£70,000 cash to a British
company. Then he would probablv stay there,
and be more or less of a British dude for ever
afterwards. A <£500,000 co. would be floated,
but the <£500,000 would go to the robbers
m London, and Australia would see none
of it. A dignified and high-toned British
manager would come out, instead of the
managerial billet being given to a local man,
and he would bring a stupendous 50-head
battery with him because the dem’d “colonials”
coulcln t be trusted to make these things, dont-
cherknow. When the gold was extracted it
would go to Hingland to pay dividends on the
Hinglish capital. The directors would be in
London, so the fees for their 1 services would go
there also ; and the only money which would
be expended locally would be the wages of the
working miners, who would be paid at the
lowest possible rate, and who would find just
as much employment under local management.
Also, the news of the boom would bring to
Victona the unemployed of the other six pro-
vinces, and the country would have to support
them somehow or other. A British gold-boom

otner words, what would become of the


hon. C. A. Goodciiap’s federal city of Hawkesburv-if I
may put a name to it—ring-fenced on all sides other than
its sea front by New South Wales, which has tried federa-
tion u ith the result of not finding it good enough V
lliis suggests a lot of things, but principally it
wakes up the whole secession problem. If there
is to be a right of secession—and The Bulletin
is distinctly of opinion, for reasons which will
appear later on, that there should not be—it is
tolerably certain that all the districts of any
particular province won’t be unanimous on the
point. Therefore, if a majority, say in New
South Wales, wanted to secede there is no just
reason why it should be allowed to force the
minority to secede along with it. A small
spot like Sydney, if it wanted to set up
again for itself, probably from motives
of pure selfishness, has no claim by sheer
force of numbers to compel the Barrier district
to go with it, simply that the Barrier trade
might be driven to Sydney by the Federal
tariff instead of going to its most convenient
outlet, Adelaide or Port Augusta; neither
should the Sydney majority be allowed to
coerce a minority in Riverina, if Riverina found
it more profitable to stay inside the Federation
and trade with its nearest port, Melbourne.
Or, again, if the Federal Government planned
a new railway policy which would enable the
far south-west of Queensland to find a short
road to the sea at Port Augusta, and the Bris-
bane majority decided to secede so as to
shut off this outlet and put the people
of the south - west on the wrong side
of the Federal Customs barrier, and thereby
make them trade at greatly increased expense
with the remote city of Brisbane, there would
be no semblance of justice in a constitution
which allowed it to do so. Neither should a
Melbourne majority be allowed to drag the
Wimmera district, whose interests lie in Ade-
laide, out of the Commonwealth for its own
selfish ends. Again, if the Federal Govern-
ment started to build the Esperance Bay rail-
way, to give the Westralian goldfields a short
road to the coast, the majority in and around
Perth would probably w T ant to secede so as to
shut down on the scheme and save that city
from practical obliteration ; but for the good of
Australia in general that majority should be
suppressed by the larger majority of the other
provinces. To put the question shortly, if a
majority in (say) New South Wales should
have the right to coerce a minority into
secession, then a majority in Australia generally
can claim an equal right to coerce a minority in
New South Wales into remaining in the Federa-
tion. If there is to lie a right of secession at
all the right should be vested in small divisions,
say in counties. Then, if Sydney and the country
whose port it is wanted to resume their
state of isolation the Riverina, whose natural
outlet is Melbourne, and the Barrier whose
natural outlet is Adelaide or Spencer’s Gulf,
would be at liberty to decide their fate for
themselves instead of being voted down by the
population of a far-off city with which they
have no natural trade interests. Similarly, if
South Queensland wanted to separate, it would
have no power to drag the North and far West,
which have few interests in common with it,
into the contract; and Perth could not coerce
Coolgardie and Esperance Bay ; nor Melbourne
compel the Wimmera to secede along with it
and send its trade again to the remote city by
the Yarra, instead of remaining in the Federa-
tion and seeking its natural outlet down the
Murray. And the difficulties in the way of
this arrangement are so many and so great,
involving a complete readjustment of debts
and many other things, that it would be a great
deal more simple and effective, and probably
quite as equitable in the end, to make the
Federal bond eternal, and have no provision for
secession at all. There is no use in having a
scheme of secession unless it is at least reason-
ably equitable, and to arrange an equitable
scheme seems practically impossible.
A Matter of Wills.
It is probable that the will under which the
Anglican Bishop of Riverina derives the major
part of his episcopal revenue will be submitted
toN.S.W. Parliament at an early date, with
the object of obtaining the cancellation of one
particularly obnoxious clause in the document.
It may be remembered that the will in ques-
tion, while setting apart a sum of money for the
support of the Bishop of Riverina, did it in
terms which appear to make it indispensable
that whoever is appointed to that see must be
consecrated in England. Dr. Anderson, when
appointed to the office, might have been conse-
crated in Australia and have thus entered on
his duties at once, but the fear that he would
by acting in this sensible way deprive himself
of the monetary advantages of the will was too
real, so he went to England, whence he re-
turned a couple of weeks ago, fully qualified
from a legal point of view to capture every
penny the tantalising testator dangled before
Holy Church. But the procedure is admittedly
obnoxious to Australian sentiment, covertly
offensive to Australian Anglican Episcopacy,
and, as a piece of practical business, a down-
right foolishness, and hence the words of the
will are forthwith to be submitted to legal
analysis and (for the conclusion is foregone)
afterwards to Parliament, with a view to
having the vexatious conditions expunged from
the document. So far, the matter is wholly,
or almost wholly, ecclesiastical and sectional
in its interest, but when it claims the assist-
ance of the courts, and especially when it enters
Parliament, it should create an occasion for
the performance of a much-wanted, long-
deferred and high public service. Unquestion-
ably the vexatious and foolish portion of
the will comes within the common-sense of
Parliament to annul: but only when Parlia-
ment is prepared to annul what is unjust,
vexatious and silly in wills in general.
Why should a will in which a hus-
band devises all or most of his wealth
to strangers, leaving his wife practically
a pauper, be considered an inviolable instru-
ment ? Why should a man who bequeaths to
a religious organisation or establishment the
bulk of all of his substance, throwing wife and
children practically on the world, be held up as
a model instead of being treated by the public
courts as a crank or a fraud ? Why should a
man who confers an allowance on his wife have
power to restrain her while she lives from re-
entering matrimony, or from living where she
nkes or with what people she likes? The
Kaverina Bishop’s demand for an alteration in
testamentary law as applied to his own see is
just but equally just is the demand of the
public that testamentary law all-round shall be
made amenable to the principles of fair play
and common sense.
Fetishes.
Bull Jingo is taking to himself immense credit
tor having demolished the fetish-houses at Coo-
massie, and claims to have ended for ever the
sacrifice of human victims in Ashantee. A
mission to civilise and enlighten the heathen
anywhere is as grand an excuse for buccaneer-
ing and looting and annexing territories as
was the plea for the “burst” of the
reformed Scotch drunkard that his “ whustlin’
canary was deid.” Religion and civilisation are
lc whistling canaries of the Maxim-armed
buccaneer Powers that want to spread— not
religion and civilisation, but themselves. It
may or may not be accidentally fortunate that
Bull Jingo has ended a reign of gory fetish
orgies; but —does not Bull Jingo himself
yearly, weekly, daily, and hourly perpetrate
to his particular fetish millions of human
sacrifices ? Human habits are matters of
training. The barbarian whose habitually
violent soul revolts not at the religious
sacrifice of and feasting on human flesh is
only a parallel edition of the so-called
civilised ” sheep who accepts a living death of
pauperdom, disguised slavery, toiling famine,
and caste domination, under the fetish of a
“ civilised religion ” that bids him “order him-
self lowly and reverently to all his betters,”
and declares to him, on a lying claim of divine
inspiration, that “it has pleased God to call
him to “ that state of life ” which means
groans and subjection to the Subjected Many,
and the swinishness of choice to the Exalted
Few. Ye who have eyes to see, ye who have
ears to hear, ye who have minds to understand
—Revise your Fetishes ! Say, ye logicians, ye
theologians, is the idolater who prostrates his
body and soul before Fat Man—Christendom’s
Jin-de-sidcle God—one grain less to be pitied,
one acorn more advanced toward freedom and
self-control, than the flat-nosed savage who
“bows down to wood and stone?” Revise
your fetishes? Powder up the latest Golden
Calf and build us another god.
Weights and Measures.
The Bulletin respectfully rises to ask all
people concerned if there is any valid reason
why Australia should adhere for ever and ever
to the stupid and cumbersome system of
weights, measures and money which it inherited
from its British forefathers, instead of adopting
the simple and convenient metrical system of
France and other countries. Under the metrical
system all moneys and all measures, whether of
capacity, weight or area, increase by
tens. The centigramme is ten milligrammes ;
the decigramme equals ten centigrammes ; the
gramme equals ten decigrammes ; the deca-
gramme is equivalent to ten grammes. There is
only one table of weights for all purposes, and
the system goes with unfailing simplicity and
regularity all through. The British system is the
most confused thing ever invented outside a
madhouse, and it almost doubles the burden of
education by its useless complexity. It in-
cludes three principal varieties of weights and
many of less importance, and none of them
have any semblance of connection with the
other. There is a separate table of weights
used by goldsmiths only. Another wholly differ-
ent one is used by apothecaries; another by wool-
dealers ; another by hay-dealers ; another by
most other kinds of dealers. A “ legal stone ”
is 141 b. ; an English stone in weighing meat is
81b.; a stone in weighing glass is 51b., while a
stone of wool is 161 b., or is supposed to be.
A hundredweight is not 1001 b. as its name
implies, but 1121 b., though in the United
states it is really 1001 b., which makes serious
confusion. Apothecaries' fluid measure has no
earthly connection with any other fluid measure.
There is considerable trouble in measures of
length through the link being7’92 inches and the
rod being 5£ yards; and the perch of 30. J square
yards is an insult to arithmetic and common-
sense. Neither in money, weights, measures
of capacity, measures of length or anything
else does British arithmetic go by any rule
whatever ; the fact that there are 12iu. in Ift.
is merely a reason why there should be 5£ yards
in a rod or 317 grains in a carat and
carats in an ounce ; and the square vards
which go to a perch are only another solid proof
of the wisdom of the system whereby an acre is
a square piece of ground measuring each way
208 ft. BJin. and about a speck over, and a mile
at sea should equal ITSI miles on land. For
many years past the press has risen at intervals
to ask why something isn’t done to amend all
this frantic confusion, and it is advisable that
it should keep on rising. The British weights
and measures were compounded out of the con-
cussion of many strange, wooden-headed
systems in the Dark Ages, and these systems
got telescoped together with the shock, and the
mass, being duly stirred up with a shovel,
assumed its present shape and remains there.
The "Well-Connected” Criminal.
The “ well-connected ” criminal that we all
know by heart now, and who is always let
down easily, put in a debauched appearance in
Melbourne the other day before Magistrate
Panton. He was alleged to be an English
8.A., a Bachelor of Medicine, and a solicitor
and barrister. Also, he was employed in the
office of a Victorian country lawyer, and during
his boss’s absence he forged a cheque for a small
sum and went on a great orgy with the pro-
ceeds. The prisoner was “ well-connected in
England,” wailed his counsel, and Mr. Panton,
after hearing the circumstances, gave him “the
rising of the court,” which meant about three
minutes’ imprisonment. As his offence was a
small one, this paper has no special objection
to the sentence in itself, but there is much
room for objection to the way it was arrived at
—or attempted to be arrived at. What all
decent people now earnestly desire to know is
this when will an honest, fearless, and abso-
lutely independent “ beak ” arise in Australia
who will commit for contempt the lawyer who
pleads that his client is well-connected ? The
said plea is a gross outrage on justice,
and the lawyer who presents it insults the
court, and the magistrate or judge who allows it
to be presented without promptly suppressing
the legal gentleman, insults himself. The plea
is always put forward in mitigation of punish-
ment, and the fact of it being put forward
distinctly implies that the magistrate is
expected to let off the well-connected person
lightly, and administer to him a different
variety of justice from that served out to the
prisoner who isn’t well-connected—in short,
that he is expected to corrupt the processes of
justice in favor of the man of “good family.”
Lhe statement, made almost in so many words,
is as follows : —“ Your Worship, there is one
kind of law for the common person and another
kind for the well-connected person, and we
want the other kind. You will please take a
crawlsome view of this case, because the
accused s friends and relatives move in good
society. A person whose relatives move in good
society should be let off where another
person would get six months or, perhaps,
two years. It is outrageous to suppose that
the law doesn’t give a certain amount of lati-
tude to a well-connected person ; it professes,
of course, not to do so, but we are behind the
scenes and know better. Your Washup, this
a well-connected person, and I claim that he
be let down easily in consequence.” .That is
not what the lawyer says, but it is just what
he means, and he means it so obviously that he
ought to be run in for contempt there and then
for meaning it.
Gruesome item from Albury (N.S.W.)
A small grazier was proceeded against at the police-
court to-day under the Diseased Animals and Meat Act,
tor disposing of a cow affected with tuberculosis. The
Government veterinary surgeon deposed that the beast
was badly affected with tuberculosis. Defendant called
several witnesses of lengthy experience among stock, who
swore that the beast was perfectly healthy. The cow
defendant stated, had been milked daily by him, and the
St. n SO U in town until a week ago, when he sold her.
The Bench, in view of the conflicting evidence, ordered the
beast to be slaughtered (O Solomonic beak !) and a post-
mortem examination made. This was done, when
the animal was found to be literally rotten with tuber-
culosis. On both lungs tumors of the size of emu-ee-irs
were found, filled with yellow matter, and the other
organs were affected to a hardly less degree The
veterinary surgeon states that the milk from such'a cow
would be a potent agent in spreading disease among
children. He is confident that many children died yearly
from disease contracted from this cause. Defendant will
appear before the Police-court again to-morrow. In
making the inspection of the dairies of this town the
veterinary surgeon condemned one cow, the milk of which
had been consumed by a number of families. The animal
was one mass of disease.
Moral: Always boil your milk.
Thus Bishop Anderson, of Riverina (N.S. VY.),
just arrived from being consecrated in Hing-
land : °
. * believe that a religious education which is ill-defined
indefinite, and undogmatic, is one which will not do for
the sons and daughters of the English people.
And voices present said “Hear, hear.” By all
means, if the Englishers like ; but so much the
worse for the sons and daughters of the English
people. For this is to say : Let all arts and
all sciences and all other branches of know-
ledge progress, evolute, develope, broaden,
fulfil themselves, but religious education, being
“defined, definite, and dogmatic,” remains
squared, and measured, and chiselled out, and
cannot be added to nor taken from. Man’s
soul may expand, his one-time rudimentary
soul-processes may become developed into new
limbs or organs, but these shall not avail him ;
his chunk of religious education is to be for
ever the same—“ defined, definite, and dog-
matic.” Monstrous tyranny of Anglicanic
hierarchy ! Still more monstrous that such a
monstrosity should scoff and jeer at and
denounce its brother hierarchy of Popery !
The men (outside Parliament) who run the
bush Labor Unions in New South Wales, and
the Labor men who represent bush electorates
in Parliament, are not, on the whole, a happy
family. Just now the quarrel revolves about
the Bourke agglomeration of Labor and Labor-
in-politics bodies and Sleath, M.P. for Wil-
cannia. Seeath expected a walk-over, but
suddenly (“ in order to circulate money,” as he
put it) a certain Murphy announced himself as
a candidate. Thereupon two prominent
unionists, friends of Sleath’s, wired to the
Bourke headquarters for money to carry on the
fight. Next day £25 came; and then there
wasn’t any fight. The money was handed to
Sleath, M.P., and he left. Presently the
executive committee at Bourke wanted
the money back, and asked for it ; the
acting secretary suggested at the same time
that Murphy’s sudden appearance and dis-
appearance didn’t look nice. Upon that,
Sleath, M.P., became offended—and his man-
hood would not permit him to refund the money
until the imputation had been withdrawn.
For the next nine months various secretaries
and Sleath, M.P., spent their hours in
writing “smart” letters to one another—or,
rather, to the public ; for very early in the
correspondence the probability of the letters
being published was mentioned. Published
now they have been; and they fill about a
dozen columns—about as melancholy an exhibi-
tion as Australian Labor-unionism has yet
furnished.
It is now announced that Johnson, imprisoned
for perjury in connection with the infamous
Butler-Rofe case, is to be liberated under the
First Offenders Act. This is about the meanest
compromise the Reid Govt, has yet effected.
If JoHNSONi. deserves to be released, then the
Government, when it refused to release him a
few weeks ago, did an act of brutal and wilful
injustice to a much-wronged man. If he doesn’t
deserve to be discharged and the Government
did its duty the last time the subject turned
up, then it is now perverting justice and show-
ing itself unfit for its position. Or, as a possible
alternative, it may be that the Government
only ventures to do a thing like this when its
lord and master, Attorney-General Want,
is away. Johnson, by the way, got three
years for trying by allegedly false evidence
to save his sister from ruin through the
conspiracy of which solicitor Rofe was a
proirunciifc part, and Rope, who was convicted
or being many times worse than Johnson,
i ion t go to gaol at all for his conspiracy, and,
though the Judge who convicted and released
mm plainly stated that he had committed per-
jury as well as conspiracy, the Reid Govern-
ment didn t even prosecute him for that second
onei ice. And why, morally speaking, Johnson
should get three years for perjury while Rofk,
tor a similar otienee in connection with exactly
the same matter, wasn’t even tried, passes the
comprehension of every fair-minded person.
I Tactically, of course, the reason is known to
every schoolboy in New South Wales.
Victorian Leg. Council is very pleased with
itself. All its own bills are becoming law, and
it keeps on putting all the Assembly bills into
the w.p. b. Last session its financial policy—•
more retrenchment and no land-tax—was forced
on the country. This session it has rejected
the One-Adult-One-Vote Bill passed by the
Assembly, and it is seeking excuses from
sundry sweaters and Fat Men to squelch the
democratic Factories Bill. It means, further,
to completely alter the aspect of the Federal
Hill. As agreed by the Tas. conference of
l rentiers, the bill passed by the Assembly
provided that the delegates to the convention
slum hi be the direct representatives of the
people. The Council proposes to make
1 arl lament appoint the delegates, pro-
bably reserving four appointments for it-
self—thus completely effacing popular interest
in the convention, and securing a powerful
representation of Fat Man in Vic.’s delegation.
Ihe idea that these 48 rich landlords are to sit
for ever on the chest of Vic. is satisfactory to
no one but themselves, and the Assembly will
presently have to make another fight to secure
its lost ascendancy. The problem is difficult
and harassing, but for desperate constitutional
diseases the desperate remedy of Black Wednes-
day is always available. The Tas. contract
was for a conference democratically elected,
and it would be absurd to hold it if the Vic.
delegates were merely the nominees of a clique.
+-
\ ic’s fatuous Opposition tried to hatch its
usual addled egg last week. Premier Turner
poes not ram his bills down the Assembly’s
throat, and the Opposition says it is a sign of
weakness. Once a fortnight, therefore, the
hatching of a new Government is attempted
but the incubators get the usual result, and the
smell of one more bad egg would annoy the
people if they were not accustomed to the inflic-
tion. When Attorney-General Isaacs pre-
sented his Companies Bill at the end of last
year, and kept a solid majority against all vital
amendments, MTntyre and his noble army of
three said it was Obstinacy. When Turner
withdrew his Railway Trust because the House
was against it, MTntyre, etc., said it was
VVeakness. Turner’s view is that the passage
of bills merely to maintain the Government’s
dignity is an effete scandal, and that the
Government is the instrument of Parliament—
not vice versa. The difficulty is that he is try-
ing to carry out the principle of elective
Government with a noil-elected Ministry, but,
in the meantime, he is affording an object-lesson
of much value, lhe present Vic. Assembly
was elected to oust Patterson, and perhaps it
will not be long before it has to seek more
detailed instructions from the country. In the
meantime, Turner is justified in treating the
Assembly as a General Committee, and not as a
House divided against itself.
Maloney’s (Vic.) notice of motion “ to restrict
security to the mortgaged property,” and the
Homes Protection Bill (on the lines “of the suc-
cessful Homestead laws of several of the United
States) are democratic steps in the right direc-
tion. Ihe Bulletin has always denounced
the system by which the mortgagee gets not
only the land, but usually everything else the
unfortunate borrower has. The bargain is with
reference to the land, and although the small
print, couched in highly technical terms, of the
mortgage may say more, the borrower, in 99
cases out of 100, is utterly unconscious of it
till he finds the bailiff in. Until the Home-
stead Law is passed, anything like permanent
home life for the Victorian farmer is practically
impossible.
Ihe practical importance of the movement
advised by The Bulletin to capture and
democratise the municipalities is illustrated by
the answer (if it is not a red-herring) given by
a Minister to Prendergast when he demanded
periodical analyses of the food used in the pro-
vince. He was told that the municipalities
had ample powers to do this, and that it was
inadvisable that the Govt, should interfere
with their functions. If this is so, every
municipal candidate should be questioned at
every meeting as to whether he will actively
work to secure the exercise of these powers, to
abolish adulteration in articles exposed for sale,
and to prosecute every person, whether a whole-
sale or retail dealer, however high and mighty,
who has on his premises any adulterated article!
Thus might the evil of adulteration be stopped
—that is, of course, if the Minister, when asked
for bread, has not given a stone.
Hear Bulletin, — Apropos your recent com-
ments on the Canally (N.S. W.) poisoning case,
let me draw attention to the gross injustice
perpetrated by the Justice Department in
bringing persons hundreds of miles on such
flimsy evidence as was adduced in the case
alluded to. When the accused has been
acquitted he is turned adrift to tramp his way
back probably without a copper in his pocket
—or otherwise stop in town and starve. lam
not sure whether the authorities did this in the
Canally case, but I know for a fact that it was
done in a similar case at Wentworth not long
ago. Such procedure seems to be the law, and,
despite the loss and anxiety sustained by the
legally-innocent man, he has no redress what-
ever. The least the authorities can do in such
cases is to issue a free pass to those wrongly
arrested.— Nixey.
A man was acquitted, and cheered, in
England the other day for shooting his wife’s
seducer. How about the woman who shoots her
husband’s seducer ?

Sydney, January 23, 1890.
Mr Dear Moorabinda—
This happened before the duties came off—
a iterm that always sounds to feminine ears as
if duties were back hair or a loose petticoat. A
China boat arrived with, inter alia, a packet of
silk for a local Hebe, but how to smuggle it ashore
was the question, for the C.O.’s keep a very sharp
look-out on tubs from the Flowery Land. The
lady, however, had another friend—a usually
smart detective—whom she sweetly asked to bring
her home from a musical party to be given on the
s.s-. Hookilah, and the ’tee gladly consented, and
proudly marched up the wharf with Hebe on one
arm and her innocent-looking roll of music under
thpotfyer, while the Customs men, who knew him,
looked!on in mute admiration of the “altogether.”
Arrived at the hotel, however, the ’tec felt rather
chilly down the back when ttlb music-case was un-
rolled and shown to contain a lovely symphony in
a dozen yards of pink silk !
Music-cases, however, occasionally fail to fulfil
their destiny—especially violin-cases. The mind-
apipearances maiden, who does the Block with
what appears to be her Strad in its coffin, very
frequently carries nothing more imposing than her
morning's shopping, which may range from chiffon
to' chops, Beople who won’t carry parcels, or
heavily-laden bags, frequently have recourse to an
empty fiddle-case, with which to go a-marketing,
ana, after all, it’s a harmonious deceit—l only
object to it because I’m afraid of its spreading.
A‘ slender girl with her violin husk filled with
ribbons and lace is all very well, but I am
frightened of fat women coming out with big,
booming ’cello eases, which they intend to fill
with pork and greens. Also, I dread the recur-
rence of. what once happened on the North Shore
ferry: a viol in-case carried by a perfectly-lovely
girl opened by accident and disclosed —a crayfish.
Apropos of smuggling, on Hit that some of the
officers who ply between Sydney and Melbourne
on local steamers occasionally have a bad time at
the hands of their lady friends this side who
generally come tripping down at the last moment
with dutiable goods neatly done up and addressed,
which they implore the flabbergasted sea-dogs to
“get ashore somehow” with the usual feminine
disregard of consequences (to other people). Some
of these packets are quite imposing, I am led to
believe, and must puzzle the ingenuity of the
mariners to dispose of—that is, of course, if they
undertake the job. But whether they do or not,
it’s not the fault of local femininity if the local
mariner isn’t a regular Baul Jones (boy’s-size) who
ought to have his vest examined ala Brough in
“ The Passport ” every time he goes ashore at a
protected port looking fatter than usual—l mean
the mariner.
Smuggling reminds me that in highly-protected
ports it is sometimes a most embarrassing thing
for a' woman to prove that her gowns are not duti-
able and.have been already worn. A moderately-
refined woman doesn’t leave ear-marks of wear on
a frock that perhaps she has only sported twice,
and it is sometimes a difficult matter to prove
previous wear to the satisfaction of ignorant
officials’Unless the frock shows some sign of it on
the collar or the binding. I have heard of a
travelleress whose dresses looked perilously fresh
and clean, and whu, in desperation, slightly
marked theinside collars with black lead-pencil to
satisfy.the morbid craving of the C.O.’s for some
evidence of wear and tear; and I also know of a
voyageuse who easily landed a brand-new gown at
Melbourne simply by sewing a couple of well-
worn arm-hol($ “ preservers ” into the brand-new
bodice. When the Gee-Gees landed in America
th6y had a great to-do to get their frocks in un-
taxed, and it was only after miich heated argu-
ment that the ladies proved that the dresses had
been worn, though how they proved it remains a
mystery, especially if the dresses did look fresh.
As a rule, a stage-costume that has seen service
betrays it by a half-mourning tinge all round the
floor-end thereof.
The latest way to read character is by the teeth,
but I hardly think it’s “deep” enough for any-
body but a school-girl. It’s so easy to read teeth
where you have both fact—real grinders—and
fiction—false ohes. But people with artificial
fangs have at least one coin fort—nobody can pos-
sibly read their characters aright, since the pro-
pensities shadowed forth in the purchased article
do not belong to’em Though occasionally they
may make tilings a little awkward. Some
advanced tooth-purveyor, for example, who doesn't
believe in having .an even set like two lines of
crockery tombstones, on tlie ground that Nature
is more or less irr gular, m.iv rig up a row like
Gabbett’s (as seen ;»,r .a recent theatrical production)
in some pretty woman s jaws mid -et all the tooth-
readers sizing her up as a sub-rosa cannibal iu eon-
sequence. •
But I believe in teeth-reading. ft's so true.
When you see a person with moss ad over her
chewing apparatus you can bet a hat that her
nails-won't stand investigation. Also, a woman
with all her front teeth set in a sort of gold post-
and-rail is likely to be careless how much money
she s|lends on herself; and a woman with vine
buck tooth and the other missing may safely be
summed up as having little personal vanity. And
the girl who grins at yon like a clown in order to
show that she has a real gold tooth in the back of
her head will probably jilt Adonis and marry
money with a skull like a hen’s egg.
I do not feel qualiti d to give any masculine
instances of the art ot tooth-readnig. Men’s
teeth do not play s:eh a forward game as
women’s teeth ; most men hide all possible dental
defects with a caretiilly-trained mo’, through
which their teeth are seen glittering like
tombstones in the starlight or esle gleaming
like rows of cut-out orange-peel—which are the
teeth tobacco generally bestows upon its most
devout disciples, I notice. To read any man’s
teeth intelligently the enthusiastic tooth-render
should wait until his barber has him by the nose.
And, talking of teeth, reminds me that a Sydney
shark—harbor variety—was caught the other day,
and a set of false-teeth, with the stamp of a
Sydney dentist thereon, was found firmly em-
bedded in its stomach. Whether they remained
as the only undigested asset in a first class tragedy,
or whether they were the long-lost fangs of the
lady who didn't feel well at sea —that is t .e
question.
Since the mercury has been fashionably engaged
in breaking the record, Sydney girls have taken
to going abroad without gloves, whether they
have rings or not, and whether they are manicured
or not. The heat is a most natural looking oppor-
tunity to show off a pink nail with a polish on ;
but when it comes to badly trimmed finger tips,
with odd-shaped nails and a suggestion of halt-
mourning in their depths and no polish to speak
of, I certainly think gloves are an advantage.
And it’s a “ bloomer ” (as the bad little boys say)
to suppose nobody notices. The world is cynical.
When it sees a bare-handed woman, the first thing
it expects is a ring, and the second thing it looks
for is a manicured expression about the finger-
tips. Therefore, maidens who wear their paws au
naturel should have either one or the other (both,
is better still) as a valid excuse.
I have always credited men with being rational
creatures. Heaven alone knows how my faith
was shaken in the dog days by the spectacle of a
youth proudly what remains of the block in
a pair of white duck trousers and a tall silk
hat after the fashion set long ago at
Sydney races by the Earl of Dudley. Apart
from the hideous incongruity of the thing,
the rule generally is to keep the feet warm and the
head cool, but this youth stood the old notion com-
pletely on its head. Imagine the conventional
soul of a man who emancipated himself as far as
cool pants, but had to rush into a shiny belltopper
to show he hadn’t quite gone astray ! What a
typical woman was lost in him ! By the-way, I
have discovered a new use for Johnuie sticks—as
bonnet-pins. Gussie, in the high wind, crooks the
top of his crutch over his hat, and there you are.
In “ Hide and Seek,” at Sydney Criterion, the
ladies of the co. were a heavy handicap on a show
that had many bright masculine points about it—
Wilfred Shine’s clever Character-sketch of a
“ laird,” and Frank Roberts’s “ waiter, ’ not for-
getting Mr. Dunbar’s decayed tragedian—but the
women were not even clotlies-props. Comedies
take a lot of dressing, and somehow, when a span
of alleged actresses come on attired in doll’s rags,
more or less (for what else does a bright-red frock
with a yellow fichu - like beef and mustard-
amount to?), the play loses its grip upon you on
the spot. One, with a fiat hat on overrun with
red flowers, like tomatoes on a soup-plate, had a
voice like a bassoon, and talked to reach an audi-
ence half a mile away; another, in a rose-pink
slip, had a bad attack of Australian accent, and
said that her hasty marriage was due to “tite.”
If in “ Hide and 3eek ” the ladies had only been
vaguely spoken of as a great force existing behind
the scenes, the result might have been different,
for the play went Smoothly and was adequately
staged, barring the window-curtains, which pre-
sented an appearance of having been nailed up in
a hurry.
Apropos theatres, the latest notion in America
is to have large armchairs placed under each
proscenium-box, intended for persons of “ un-
usual size ” whom, the ordinary chairs don’t
fit. I think it an excellent idea. A few of these
scattered about the Sydney shows would certainly
relieve the d.c. pressure on first nights when the
fat woman with the rattling bead trimming comes <
out of her chair with a pop like a drawn cork.
Rain played up with the opening of the well-
advertised cricket-match, N.S.W. v. Victoria, at
Sydney Association ground last Saturday, so far
as the crowd looking on went; but I couldn’t help
thinking it was good business for the cricketers
slopping round in the mud, as some of them expect
to go ’Ome, where that sort of remorseless drizzle
is an everyday occurrence. Therefore, a good wet
“pitch” (I think that isthe proper word) and a
slipper-slopper “crease” appear to me to lie the
very things to enable the choosing committee to
jnck their men with neatness and dispatch. But
rain spoils the game from a ladies’-pavilion stand-
point. Wet umbrellas are certainly a, novel and
uncommon sight these times, but they turn a
gathering of intelligent human beings into a mass
meeting of mushrooms.
A Sydney magazine has a long illustrated article
in a recent number on Sydney Hospital, from
which it would appear that the large, highly-
omamental building is a sort of Paradise bound.
But one great defect escapes mention, which is
th it all applicants, men and women, black, white,
yellow, or brown, are yarded up together on soni'
forms under the southern wing, and in the middle
stands a desk presided over by the officer who
issues orders to attend the doctor.
So as to determine what medico the patient
should attend, he or sht must rise up and describe
all symptoms in a loud ai d distinct voice, and the
feelings of a respectable man who has to explain
the leading features of his case lie fore a lumber of
strange women.
“ The days of Sairey Gamp are gone, says the
same magazine. Yet, the other day, in ail up-
country town the patient was prescribed poached
eggs. “ Mary,” said the nurse, “have you any-
tli.ng to poach eggs in?” After diligent search
nurse’s eagle eye rested on a spittoon on the
mantelpiece which was kept spick -and-span for
parlor use. “ All,’ she said, “ this must be che
thing.”
But nurses have a hard row to hoe, and their
life is by no means skittleish. lam told of a
blue-eyed sister Dora who thought that pro
fessional nursing mainly consisted of holding
on to intellectual foreheads varied by spooning
jelly into good-looking he-patients, and who came
as a probationer into a Northern hospital not long
ago. Her first job was to hold the candle while
Sawbones hacked the leg off an “accident” who
had just b'-en brought in, and when the butcher-
ing was over the surgeon calmly tossed the gory
limb into her arms for her to carry away some-
where. She did stagger with the gruesome burden
as far as the door, but fainted just outside, still
clasping the leg to her heart.
The fun ot Sydney Turf Club races is that
amateurs ride in some of the flat flutters, and, in
ease they should be mistaken for professionals,
they are always designated “ Mister ” So-and-So,
while the genuine jockey is billed as plain Tom,
Dick, or Harry. Tnat, however, is not the only
difference between them, though, of course, tlie
amateurs think it is. 1 can always tell a gentle-
man rider by the voluminousness of his riding-
pants ; you may also spot him with certainty by
the unaccustomed way he sports silk, which gener-
ally makes him look like a lightweight seen at a
masked ball. By the way, the mantle of tl.e
amateur rider “ Bercie ” Duff, the ex-Governor’s
son, who certainly had a clever knack of getting
his nose in front—would seem to have descended
on a son of ex-Mayor Manning, who generally
pilots his moke to victory whenever an amateur
race is in the wind.
Two society brides adorned the members’ stand
—the newest wearing dark-blue with birds-eye dot
and white points til the shape of gloves, belt and
parasol; the other, whose nose she has put out of
joint, so to speak m the bridal sense, wearing a
dark-green with a rainbow bodice—a most cheer-
ful garment to come back from a honeymoon in,
Miss Faber turned up in a cinnamon suit and
turned-back collar and cuffs—the latest fashion set
by English Jolmniedom. Miss Faber off is not a
bit like Miss Faber on. In private life Miss F.
has a New VVoman-y look that almost suggests a
longing to burst out in bloomers, while on the
stage tew actresses can approach the lady with the
name suggestive of drawing-pencils for her intense
“ old ”, womanliness —as “Mrs. Quesnell ’ in
“ Susan,” for instance, she almost melted in your
mouth. Miss Hilda a pong in black silk and jet
and a black hat, was also on view.
A Society matron cut rather a dash in straw-
berry and black mohair with a new-fangled bodice
—she really was ttie best-dressed object on the
asphalt—-mid the ugliest frosk was sported by
another Society matron who wore the festive hue
pf the slate-pencil and no collar to her gown.
This sudden absence of collar isthe inevitable re-
action from tlie sore-throaty wrappings that have
mercifully draped Society's long and somewhat
stringy gullet since last summer—but do let me
warn the many women who haven’t necks like
Henrietta Watson’s to cling to their folded collars
as long as ever they can. A woman without a
collar looks like a gul-bird, and she should reniem-
bjf that her neck gives her age away with greater
celerity than even her elbows do. Another matron,
in black-and-white stripes, was evidently unaware
that a Sydney draper now dresses his employes in
that distinctly-played -out combination, and i can-
not say 1 liked the effect of two broad white
sash-ends on a black skirt like moleskins drying in
a coal-cellar. A widow in green sleeves and pink
roses sprinkled all over had evidently gone out of
mourning up to her bonnet, which was demurely
black. Evidently it is the correct caper to shed
the weeds of woe feet first.
Apropos of mourning, I was surprised to see
that tsooiety vvasn t almost hidden in crape in
honor of Battenbergs death. Generally Botts
Point jumps at the chance of hanging a weeper
around its bat when Royalty is understood to be
scarcely distinguishable from a quantity of spilt
mk owing to domestic bereavement, and to see a
butterfly throng m all colors of the kaleidoscope
when they knew for a moral cert, that Vic-
toria was crape to the heels, looks as if Society was
less sympathetic or less eager to advertise itself at
Royalty s expense than usual.
Talking of royalty reminds me that some musi-
cal enthusiasts held an Eisteddfodd, or
equally exciting, at Newcastle, N.S.W., the other
day, and, when a band of badly-matched vocalists
with peculiarly excruciating tenors, came on ami
took the cake (being the only choir entered for the
screeching contest, they couldn t well muss it), the
oracle in charge told them that, ,f they .kept on
straining themselves trying to sing Welsh without
getting the lockjaw, they might some day have
the honor of [>ertormmg before royalty itself. It
strikes me tli it Gov. Hampden should be thankful
the Eisteddfodd Hies at such high game. With
their eyes fixed firmly oil the throne, itself, it s not
likely those stringy Welsh tenors will come bark-
ing round Guv’nientouse, at any rate.
Writes my Melb. correspondent
“ Melbourne journals, enumerating the artistic
triumphs of a society flower-painter, lately re-
moved to London, chronicle the baffled efforts of
t’otherside decorative firms to annex the lady to
their respective staffs. People who went ’Orae by
the same boat as the artist find the traditional
grain of salt absolutely indispensable to the diges-
tion of such statements.
“ Patriotism is well enough, but one gets tired
of the ever-recurring Australian prodigy who
means to ‘ knock ’em iii London or know the
reason why ! ’ The first step towards fame, in
these cases, is paved with benefit-tickets, and
then the aspirant departs ’mid a flourish of
trumpets, to disappear, more often than not, in
the “ Big Smoke, ” never to be heard of afterwards
except through the medium of private letters,
extracts from which are published in local society
columns for the edification of “sympathisers.” He
who casts his bread upon the waters in the shape
of subscriptions, is compensated after many ('are
by the perusal of tit-bits, such as these, ‘That
gifted young Australienne, Miss .lew’s Harp
Jones, playfully termed ‘the Croajingolong
Canary,’ out of compliment to her birthplace,
intends,’etc., etc., or ‘the friends of the Bung-
bung baritone may be congratulated on the fact
that having conquered his chronic catarrh, he is
resolved ’ —and so on.
“ Fortunately for themselves, ‘the Old Folks at
’Ome ’ take most things pretty calmly, even the
advent of the‘typical New World Genius,’with
Ins cheek kissed by the South wind, eyes far-
gazing, as becomes a iKiundless bush-seer —and all
the rest of it. For one thing, it’s been going on
so long. Ages ago, when ■ Gats Gregory, ’ one of
the famous exploring family and afterwards the
first Bananaland Surveyor-General was tendered a
complimentary banquet on the eve of his depar-
ture for Europe, he told his hosts at Berth
(W.A.) that ‘some people sought greatness,
others had it thrust upon them,’ but for his part
he was determined to ‘ slip quietly info London if
he had to make a midnight job of it.’
“ * Ah, well,’ as old We.cralians always, i.
mr,er[)olate at this point, the Gregorys were-.a
plucky lot, though so rampagious as youngsters
that their widowed mother often sent a messenger
to a neighbour’s house with ‘ her compliments and
she would esteem it a favor if Mr. So and-So
would come over when dist ngaged and punish
two, three, or four of the boys, as the case might
be. Barents who seldom mustered tip e fcrgy
to discip ine their own olive-branches d.d ft it
welcome these invitations ; but in the sister pro-
vince, long, long ago, a gentleman could not refuse
to oblige a lady, so reciprocal compliments were
always returned to the effect that ‘Mr. X. would
be delighted,’ Ac., &c.
“ Some good stories have of late been told of a
dashing Melb. widow unduly addicted to double-
entente. Australians, for their part, complain of
the blatant plain-speaking affected by high-toned
English visitors. A well-knoWn local society-
leader, for instance, has not yet quite forgiven the
gilded importation, who remarked calmly, in the
course of an afternoon visit, that ‘one thing he
didn’t care so very mech about in the cawlonies,
doncherknow, was the sanitary arrangements’—
only he didn’t put it so mildly. Another pam-
pered scion caused a flutter in escutcheoned halls,
not 100 miles from the Fitzroy Gardens, by
informing a knot of lately-emancipated damsels,
who were discussing their ex-schoolmistress, that
he d had the honor of ‘ pinching the said duemia s
h‘o 1 He, with kindred spirits, it seems, while
dangling clandestinely round her seminary, with
a view to manceuvring billets-doux into the
hands of resident salad heiresses* had been
mistaken for burglars. Thereupon the students
screamed until the commander-in-chief oame
to the rescue, and stood on a chair to push
down a refractory window-sash. This was too
tempting an opportunity to be missed by the ring-
leader of the baffled serenaders, who, as he
crouched on the dark lawn just outside, found it
easy to wreak vengeance on her Dragonship’s
adjacent anatomy.
Apropos of the ancient collier Aldinga,
wrecked up Sydney way last week (Jan. 23rd),
that same sheer hulk was a crack passenger-boat
6o years ago, and tremendously popular with
travelling Westralians, who transhipped into
her at Adelaide, after some awful weeks from
b remantle to the S.A. capital in a sailing,.trig.
Ihe captain of one of the latter purgatories once
gave up his own cabin and had it painted in readi-
ness for two lady passengers, recommended to his
special care. lhe paint had not time to dry,
but this was not detected at first, because, for about
tiThli lm . llatea just lay in their berths and
wished themselves dead. As soon as they began
to take notice, however, they discovered that their
heads were painted white with bumping against

The Freetrade
Policy to which N.S.W. has recently reverted has
proved more than a nine days’ topic in the com-
mercial circles of Melbourne, and many specula-
tions are made as to how the new order will affect
intercolonial trade in the immediate future. While
there is a consensus of opinion that the non-
restrictive policy will to some extent benefit
Sydney at the expense of Melbourne, there are
isolated facts which point in quite the contrary
direction. For example : Messrs. Manning and
'Company, the popular ladies’ outfitters, of Coll ins-
street, Melb., have always had considerable busi-
ness transactions with the mother colony, but,
since the New Year, their orders from N.S.W. for
Costumes, Cloaks, and Millinery have been far
larger than usual. A drawback refund of duty is
obtained from Vic. Customs House, and credited
.to the buyer by Manning and Co., so that buyers
across the borders get their purchases duty free.
Thus, if it were not for the trouble occasioned by
the narrower policy of the southern province,
Melb. merchants should find the Freetrade pro-
gramme of N.S.W. very much to their advantage.
Howbeit, Messrs. Manning and Co. are sanguine
of now largely extending their business with the
ladies of N.S.W., who think, rightly or wrongly,
that Melb. modes are always in advance of those
of Sydney. Ladies !—Write to Manning and Co.,

there were no intoxicant in store, so he visited
trie invalids, who, in addition to their other woes
were half-poisoned with the smell of paint, and re-
commended turpentine as a substitute. Now the
younger of t le victims, as it happened, had once
experimented with turpentine on a curly poodle
pup, for a malady unconnected with paint. ‘ All
nis beautiful white curls came off,’ she sobbed in
answer to the skipper’s suggestion. * And after
ried been bald ever so long, his coat grew again
but hes been a Smooth, straight-haired dog ever
since ! At last, the Captain produced a bottle of
spirits, kept for ‘ medicinal purposes,’ and a mili-
tary pensioner’s wife, proof against sea-sickness
came up from the fore-cabin and rubbed both
heads in turn at so much per day. After this ex-
perience, the Aldinga, from Adelaide to Mel-
bourne, seemed like a floating Paradise, obtainable
for the paltry price of J 26.
Looking far back at the Royal pantomime,
one cant help shuddering, even at this safe dis-
tance, at its tag-rag and bobtail clothes. The
as a general thing, deliciously idealises the work-a-
day costumes of real lite, vide Flo. Young’s stock-
man (Djin-Djin). It was quite otherwise with the
poor, dear, shabby old ‘Santa Claus’ wardrobe.
Take trie bed-gown ballet, for instance. The little
dancers in their creased whitey-grey garments
suggested rather a New Woman’s incarnate ’ mis-
takes ’ than the soaped and towelled offspring of
the average mother.
“ An unusual feature of the performance was the
complete naturalness of the juveniles involved.
Nothing more convincing could possibly be
imagined than their cheerful methods of romping,
kicking up their heels, yawning, biting their nails
- m fact, doing everything which they should not
have done and vice versa, m true child fashion.
“ Mist Florence Wilton, who, unlike most of her
colleagues, looked as if her clothes were really and
truly her veiy own, made ‘Jack the Giant-
killer ’ just as bright as a button, and worked like
a polo pony. Every time she bounded onto the
boards like an indiarubrier ball and kept the ball
rolling all the time she was there. Facially con-
sidered, a longish and sharpisri nose would seem
to be the thorn in Miss Wilton’s otherwise charm-
ing ‘ flesh. ’
“It would seem that Melb.’s stock ot female
loveliness is at a low ebb. One beautiful face fills
all the photographers’ show-cases, and on the Block
alone there are more than 20 pictures of the same
belle. It seems hardly fair to the lovely sitter
that her face should be made stale in this way.
Even the small street boys have got to know her
name now, and criticise each new photo, with
much discernment.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

A new co. started on Saturday to fool with
Providence at Sydney Criterion—where Provi-
dence has gone back on many people of late—by
staging “ Hide and Seek, ” a comedy which is past
its first youth, and which consists largely of a
Scotch person trying to throw one Jones over a
balcony. The play consists mostly of Jones.
There are six persons, all more or less Jones, con-
cealed in three separate rooms in a hotel, and the
Scotch person, armed with a large, shapeless griev-
ance and a threepenny piece, hovers in the vesti-
bule and storms them as they come out.
Consequently, after a while, the Joneses don’t
come out any oftener than they can help,
and when they do emerge they run for
their lives. A pleasant feature of the case
is that two or three people call in at vari-
ous times and assault the Scotchman over
various imaginary grievances, or propose to him,
or accuse him of wife-desertion, or leave a black
infant with him. “ Hide and Seek ”is a violent
production where people skull-drag each other
round the premises on the slightest provocation,
and the whole affair would be over in five minutes
if the Highlander, instead of waiting in the vesti-
bule during three acts for his wife to come out,
would go into her room and fetch her. He is a
futile Caledonian, however, and, instead of adopt-
ing this simple expedient, he remains outside and
makes furious attacks on Jones. When he can’t
find anyone called Jones, he is willing to attack
any other jierson instead. Even when he is run
in ne simply gets bail, and comes back to sit in
the old place, and renew his efforts to cripple
Jones. Finally, 12 basketsful of broken Jones
are gathered up and removed, and the only other
very definite result is that the Scot nearly
Strangles the waiter in his efforts to make him
give back 3d.
*,* * *
The male element in the co. is decidedly
strong, and the female one lamentably weak.
Wilfred Shine is even a better Scotchman than he
is an Irishman, which is saying a good deal.
Ralph Roberts’s waiter is reminiscent in some
respects of Boucicault. Laurence Dunbar is a fine
crushed tragedian, and fills the part which Newton
Griffiths occupied when “ Hide and Seek ” was
played at the Opera House long ago—the only
admirable thing which the awful Griffiths ever
did in the course of The Bulletin's acquaintance
with him ; and Frank Hawthorne, as a valuable
idiot, has invented a walk with a peculiar stutter
in it, which is strikingly expressive of insanity in
the feet and ought to be worth a lot of money.
J. wo or three other people also shape well. As for
the ladies, the Pest that can be said for them is
that two of them are a good deal worse than a
third one, from which rash and ill-judging people
may rush to the conclusion that the third one isn’t
SO as Die other two. Also, a fourth one
—Miss May Burney—is a lot better than the third
one, which means that she is moderately good and
that the third lady aforesaid is very bad. The
Bulletin prudently omits~the name of this third
lady lest the first and second ladies should call
round.

Sydney Music Hall has been re-organised
with a new co. T. Driscoll Foley proves himself
as good as this paper anticipated, and is most of
the show m himself. Percy Shannon and two
Italian musical gentlemen ‘are a good part of the
other half. The Tivoli still prospers marvellously,
and the notice “ Standing'Boom Only ” is getting
badly frayed at the edges with much wear and
tear. p**

The “ Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith ” will be
staged at Sydney Lyceum on Saturday, and some
muiv light will be thrown on the Woman with a
Past. And pist here the writer takes the oppor-
tunity of offering his opinion, which is that the
true drama ot a Woman" with a Past —the re-
formed woman, that is—haw vet to be written. Said
female, in his opinion, whbn she gets tired of sin
simply removes to a new locality, and calls
self Smith and tells a pathetic tale *>f widowhood.
And then, if she is good-looking—and she couldn’t
get up much of a past if she wasn’t — some dull,
irreproachable citizen marries her, and her old
boon companions never find her, because she has
cleaned some of them out, and others have gout,
and others again are helping some other women to
have the same
kind of a past.
Therefore she
grows old and re-
spectable arid com-
monplace, and be-
comes the mother
of a dreadfully
dull prig in a high
collar.

Westmacott’s
bulky drama with
the undressed He-
brew in it seems
to be turning out
a paying spec, at
Sydney Royal.
This can’t be
owing to the
scenery, for there
is not much, nor
the plot, for it is
neither very new
nor very striking;
so the only pos-
sible conclusion is
that undressed
Hebrew is the
sort of dram atic art
that appeals to the great soul of the city of sand-
shifters. The “ Workgirl ” is. a play which leaves
nothing to the imagination. When Sweeney flies
dressed principally in a guilty conscience and a
table-cloth his legs appear to a considerable extent
below the table-cloth as a guarantee of good
faith. Harrie Ireland is tiriderstood to have
“ fallen ” and to be the surreptitious possessor of
an infant, and this infant, and the fact that she
didn’t ought to have it, are at great
length with much attention to. detail. Too much
scantily-clad Hebrew, and too much infant, are
the chief troubles of the drama, and the other
troubles are the Hebrew, when he has all his
clothes on, lurking on a bridge and leering greasily
at the small girls who pass by, and trying to paw
them with the fat, moist hand of the Social Lvil.
*■ # # *
Dan. Barry’s dramatic company, strength-
ened by a brass band, is still upholding Hingland’s
honor at Johannesburg, and the Russians continue
to perish ingloriously behind the scenes of Melb.
Alexandra. “The Roll of the Drum ”is a story
of some unknown period when the Czar bearded
the British Lion in his South African den. This
must have been pretty long ago, seeing that the
hero, wMo considers himself a freeborn Londoner,
gets mistaken for a Russian serf. Whereupon he
follows the Queen’s colors to the Transvaal, and
proves to be his colonel’s long-lost son, in conse-
quence of which he is allowed to rescue the Colors
from destruction, instead of being hanged as a
foreign spy. The curse of serfdom is then shifted
to a pale young lady in a black costume, at the in-
stance of a hairy Muscovite, her alleged father.
Luckily this interloper is only her uncle, so his
attempt to cast her into slavery is frustrated. Also,
the haughty colonel, and the hero who died of 10
mortal wounds in the second act, come back to
THE HEAT-WAVE.
MR. BORNDRUNK : “ The heat teas a hundred and ninety-eight in the shade.”
MR. BOOSEMORE (endeavoring to give him. his quietus): “Fahrenheit or
Centigrade? ”
MR. BORNDRUNK (not to he caught): “ Well, a hit of both!”
Johannesburg in the nick of time, pursued by the
victorious brass band, and at the same moment
the comic Irish sergeant shoots Augustus Glover
from the rear. Consequently the drama comes to
a happy end, the last invisible charge of the
British Grenadiers having earned the Czar by
storm and left President Kruger dead upon the
ramparts, or something to the same effect. The
fall of Glover is received with much rejoicing in
the Alexandra gallery, although he performs his
insane misdeeds quite admirably and supplies
the warlike drama with all its plot. Some
of the others, notably Miss Dora Mostyn, Dan
Barry, J. P. O’Neill, and Wilson Forbes deserve
a good word for their acting, but they don’t go
prowling after “ papers,” or keep innocent people
out of their property, as the stalwart Augustus
does. Besides, it is he who murders Dora Mostyn,
and so gives “ The Roll of the Drum ” a chance to
be pathetic. The spectacle of four supers walking
away, an inch at a time, with the corpse of that
chirpy little drummer-boy is a feast of sadness,
and when manager Barry gently lays Britain’s
flag upon the cold remains, one feels almost as
solemn as an amen in church.
** * *
The heart of Melb. Princess’s remains true
to its “Djin-Djin. ” No new remarks concerning the
Firm’s prosperous show suggest themselves this
week, so The Bulletin will merely shake its bad
bald head at the well-built ballet and pass on.
** * *
The Opera House, likewise, is doing
much the same as last week, with results equally
satisfactory. Pope and Sayles have arrived there
once more, whilst Harry Rickards and Alice
Leamar haven’t gone away. These illustrious
favorites are, however, thinking of going away
shortly, and an announcement to that effect makes
the city moan a good deal in its sleep. But for
the promise of a host of new attractions to follow
the iiop'iiaoe would probably break down alto-
gether.
W. S. Gilbert has come triumphantly
through a libel-action brought against him by a
gushing lady journalist known as the Comtesse
de Bremont (nee Dunphy). The “Comtesse”
wrote to the humorist, asking for an interview,
and when he replied that his terms for submitting
himself to the ordeal were 20 guineas, the lady
wrote back saying that she anticipated the plea-
sure of doing his obituary notice for nothing.
Bilious W.S.G. complained of the pen-woman’s
“cheek” in a letter to the London dailies, and
also dropped a note to her editor (Sr. Paul’s
magazine), suggesting that her future comments
on him (Gilbert) or This work would need to be
received with caution. These letters were the
grounds for action, and the jury found them
not good enough. But the lady will probably
make money by the deal. It came out in evidence
that she is the authoress of a spicy volume of
poems, some of which made the learned Judge
blow his nose embarrassedly when read aloud in
court. One poem in particular seems likely to
create a demand for the book—a sonnet entitled
“Love’s Consummation.” The comtesse dedicated
this warm, clinging little bit of female literature
to her husband, who, by the way, had been dead
seven years when the book was published. The
idea of dedicating such a honeymoon reminiscence
to the defunct partner seems slightly gruesome.

Or, rather, Ins riame is the best-known, for Mr.
Cog hi ah, as modest as he is able, is personally one
of the most retiring of men. Though scarcely 40
years old, he lias had a quarter-century of Govt,
service. He began in the Education Dept., then
went to the Harbors and Rivers, becoming a Civil
Engineer. When appointed Govt. Statist in ’B6 he
sought everywhere for records, thoroughly organ-
ised thecollection of provincialstatistics, andhreated
order out of chaos. Mis “ Wealth and Progress oi
IS.S. W.” ; “ The Seven Colonies of Aust&lasia ” ;
and the N*S. W. Statistical Register ” have won
sjKmtaneous praise from such men as Mulhall and
Lomhroso. Mr. Coghlan was one of the chief
agents in effecting the Sydney water-supply
scheme; he is a fundamental counsel to N.S.W.
legislators ; he supervised the drafting of the
l nolle Service Act. Able, just, and knowing
full well the abuses of the N.S.W. Govtr. depart-
ments, he can do the State inestimable service.
He comes of a talented family; his sister, Miss
lza Coghlan, was one of the first two lady doctors
of Sydney University, and his brother, Dr. C. A.
Coghlan, is a leading Sydney barrister and Uni-
versity law-lecturer.

Mr. G. A. Wilson, who for the first year
"ill ho chairman of the board, is a big, brawny,
wary, unflinching, 50-year-old Scotchman, liked
and trusted by those with whom he comes into
contact. As a youth he did a four-years’ course
at Aberdeen University; lie did not graduate.
He travelled much in the States and Europe and
joined the B.N.Z. in ’74, became Melbourne
accountant in *B3, Melbourne manager in ’BB, and
Sydney manager ’9l. His bank salary was £l3OO
j*er annum; his accrued rights in the bank ] ension*
fund were £3OO per annum. He very level-
headedly forfeits these for £lOOO per year
under the State. At first he declined the
chairmanship, but after two interviews with
Premier Reid he accepted. Being a Strahget
to civil servants he should be ari impartial
man in reform. He says, “No relative of mine
is in the Govt, employ and none shall be.” His
business experience as a banker and the know-
ledge of human nature he has acquired-thereby
Will no doubt help his judgment m his present
duties. He has had many experiences of the bad
side of human nature, but “a banker tells
nothing.” Concerning Australians afiid' Britishers
he says : “ It is not fair to compare them, for we
get so few of the better Britishers out here.” Prom
his own personal experience he prefers Australian
youths as bankers or servants'to any'other ; “ the
prominent features of the Australian character
are self-reliance and power of initiative.— ,
* * * *
Mr. Joseph Barling, the third Commis-
sioner, is an Englishman, 56 years old, with 36
years of N.S.W. Govt, service. He first served
in the Audit office; next in the Harbors and
Rivers Dept. ; then in the Railway ; then in the
Harbors and Rivers again; and for Six or seven
years past lie has been U.-S. for Works. Mr] Bar-
ling, having been through the length and brie; dth
of the service, is one of the most familiar iof its
characters; his most prominent characteristics are
his clear-headedness, his enthusiastic love of work,
and his constant affectation of diplomacy. No one
knows better than Mr. Barling thatgreat reductions
must come upon the demoralised N.S.W. civil
service ; nor is anyone more apprehensive of the
fact that retrenchment in many cases means for
the confirmed civil servant—for the mature auto-
maton —penury and death.
The death last week of Mr. J. J.
Hinchy, of whom a portrait is printed in this
issue, caused a well-known figure to be miss-
ing from the members’ pavilion at the inter-
provincial cricket-match. Mr. Hinchy was for-
merly an enthusiastic and active member of the
Warwick cricket club, and, to the last, no big
cricket-match took place without his presence as
an onlooker. “Jimmy,” as he was best-known to
his many friends, was a musician of no mean order,
and for years was tenor soloist at St. Mary’s
Cathedral.
About once in every three months Melb.
Argus or Age discovers a plot to overthrow the
existing Ministry. The conspiracy, when found
by the Age, is mean and contemptible, whereas it
is said to be a matter for public joy when the other
organ brings it to light. In either case, the revela-
tion is followed by a paragraph announcing that
the plot collapsed for some reason or other, as
soon as the newspaper sjioke. Also, in either
case, the one newspaper congratulates the public
upon the disappearance of an inconvenient crisis,
whilst the rival organ indulges in a burst of scorn.
This periodica] occurrence grows very monotonous.
H. H. Champion intends to be his own
lawyer if attorney O’Halloran insists upon going
to court with his case, and will not have a fool for
his client. He distinguished himself by the
defence he made in 1886, when charged with
Burns, Hyndman and Co., for sedition. The bar
against him included Charles Russel], Poland, and
Charles Matthews. In discharging the prisoners,
the judge remarked that “the defendant Champion
deserved great credit for what he had done.”
Matthews was much struck with his ability, and
declared that “ he would make his fortune at the
bar. ”

It is announced that the statue of Gov.
Phillip, ordered long ago in the good old loan-
boom times, will be erected on the site of the
burnt-down Garden Palace in Sydney Botanic
Gardens. Twelve thousand lovely sovereigns are
being spent on what will probably prove at best
only a middling sort of statue of Botany Bay’s
first boss gaoler—a commonplace and uncouth
semi-German naval captain, of whom the world
knows little. However, the deed is done, and
the bleeding country is saddled by that absurd
old spendthrift Parkes with a charge of, say, £1 a
day for ever or thereabouts, in order that the
world may be reminded that Sydney is a dropsical
pumpkin growing on an English dungheap.

The alleged Tasmanian outrage makes a
curious story. The daughter of a Launceston
grocer was travelling by train from Hobart to
Launceston, in a compartment occupied by one
other passenger—a male. The lady alleges that he
offered her a rug, and accused her of bashfulness
because she refused it, adding that she would be
better pleased to have a young man with her than
an old married fellow like him. She said she didn’t
allow young men to travel with her at night, and
went to sleep. She woke suddenly, felt dizzy,
and smelt chloroform —at least, she thought it was
chloroform, though she never took chloroform
before. Then she said, “Oh, the wretch!”
and jumped out of the window. He re-
marked, “Oh, my God!” This was in
Tasmania, as before-mentioned, and the train
was a Tasmanian mail-train, so the lady was not
much hurt, and was able to tell her story fluently
when the guard, roused by the yells of the passen-
gers, came back and picked her up. Her alleged
assailant declared that he was dozing, and knew
nothing about the matter until he saw her feet

disappearing through the window. *An indepen-
dent witness, who entered the compartment
immediately afterwards, couldn’t smell chloroform
ov anything else. The man, of course, has been
arrested.
The Bulletin, for one, is quite prepared to face
imprisonment for life when it is found guilty of
the folly of getting into a railway-carriage deco-

A tragic disappearance is reported from
Melbourne. A fortnight ago two small boys
started for the baths, at Middle Park. They
never got there, and they never came back, and
for a good many days the most energetic search
cast no semblance of light on the mystery. Then,
one day, a bank of sand on a waste allotment
caved in slightly, and left a human foot sticking
out, and a little digging revealed the pair. They
had evidently taken shelter from the rain beneath
an overhanging mass of sand, and it had slid down
on top of them and smothered them both. An
almost identical tragedy took place many years
ago in the neighborhood of Moore Park, Sydney.
A young man took his best girl for a walk there
by moonlight, and they sat down under the lee of
a huge sandbank to hug each other, or talk about
how they would have the house furnished when
they were married, and what kind of glaring oil-
cloth they would have in the passage, or some-
thing, and just then the sand fell on them and
buried them. They were found a year or two
afterwards, one skeleton in the arms of the other
skeleton, and how they decided to have that house
furnished when they got married no one ever
knew not in this world, anyhow. Perhaps, where
their ghosts went to, they found a better oilcloth
than the one they reckoned on, and an angel laid
it down for them without any trouble.

Judge Holroyd declares that a married
woman who has contracted debts she does riot
mean to pay cannot be sent to gaol on a fraud-
summons. Another grievance. Why is it that
the lowest larrikin in the land, spitting and
blaspheming on a corner, may be sent to gaol for
refusing to pay his just debts, whilst the privilege
is denied to woman ?

Speaking of Albert Calvert (and valet) even
tradesmen may be over-advertised. A fashion-
able ladies’ tailor once received an order from a
Governor’s wife. The fact got into the daily
papers. The “society ” journals went one better,
and put the cheque down at £127, while, in fact)
the real amount was seven guineas. Landlord,
reading of larger amount, comes down for rent, and,
despite his protestations, tailor is obliged to go
insolvent. On going through his books the trustees
concluded that he had pawned goods bought on
credit—an offence against the insolvency law. He
was finally acquitted by the jury, but hot until he
had done some months of agony, suspense, adjourn-
ment and bail.

Summary of Deceased Wife’s Sisters’ Act
—a sister-in-law is not a sister-in-law.
Probably the most
God-forsaken corner of
the earth is the town-
ship of Boulia, Queens-
land back-blocks. The
local temperature ranges
from below freezing-
point in winter to
125 deg. in the shade in
summer. It is (says a
notorious Western liar)
possible to perspire freely
at Boulia, during Xmas-
time, in the ice - chest.
Civil-servants, exiled
thither, have been known
to bum down the pre-
mises and flee. Some
months ago, a China-
man, with true Celestial
grit, started a garden
there, and, after incredi-
ble exertions, succeeded
in raising a curious,
blighted, blasted-looking
vegetable reputed to be
a cabbage, together with
a wild, uncouth, withered
article of the melon
variety. The favorite
occupation of the
Boulians was to come

The latest - opened fashionable Sydney

into those windows half as many women’s feet as
they have squeezed women’s boots.
At South Melbourne Court, the other day,
a man was called upon to “kish the buke, and
when he had fervently glued his lips to the holy
scriptures, a doctor present drew attention to the
fact that he was suffering from a vicious-looking
cancerous growth on the mouth. By this time,
however, the sacred Word had passed round and
been sampled by other witnesses. The Bulletin
hereby directs the attention of the inspectors of

Bibles used in the local courts, and calls upon
them to demand the removal of the same in accord-
ance with the provisions of the Health Act. Only
a day previous to the incident recorded, a man
was fined for having a bad drain in his back yard.
It is rough to fine a man for such an offence, after
swearing him on the “source of our greatness ”
polluted with cancer and fragments of unregistered
leprosy.
If The Bulletin ran a religious news
department it would label it “ The Tame

The Westralian telegraphic service is slow
and not sure. When the Orotava arrived at
Albany, on Saturday week, the usual wire was
sent to Adelaide with the usual announcement.
The Orotava reached Adelaide three days later"
about four hours after the telegram, but, as she
did not leave W.A. till some time subsequent to
the sending of the wire, she might easily have
reached Adelaide in time to break the news of the
approaching ’gram. The remark of the Orotava’s
captain, when they told him of the incident, was :
“ Hope you don t blame my boat—that’s the wire
we sent last trip.”

In the mutton-bird season hundreds of

a pat on the back from the author of ‘ ‘ Self-Help ”
went one better than that. He exhibited a set-
ting of eggs at a country show, where they took
first-prize, and afterwards sold them at a
fancy rate. The matronly biddy who had charge
of them was used to imposition, having mothered
wandering turkeys and amphibious ducks before,
but this was too much. Little mutton-birds !

Dear Bulle-
tin, —Why, in
the economy of
the law, should
horseflesh be re-
garded as so
much more valu-
able than human
flesh ? The one
mustn’t be work-
ed if it shows
th el east scratch;
the other is
forced to totter
on till it drops.
The other day I
saw an inspector
drag a Chinese
hawker into the
cells on the mere
supposition that
his horse wasn’t
in good working
order. The
Bench dismissed
the charge as a
too ridiculous
attempt at pock-
eting half the
fine. More
cautious another
time, the in-
spector pro-
duced two vets,
to swear that an
otherwise - well-
conditioned cart-
horse had a sore
tendon. A
nominal fine was
inflicted, but, of
course, heavy
profess ional
costs. Reverse
the case, and put inspectors on the half-fine
system to watch human animals at work, and
how many would pass muster ?—Q.R.

a N.Q. run-manager whose custom is to talk to
“ travellers ” thus : “ Look here, men. If you’re
hungry to need’s extent, kill a sheep, and I’ll never
say a word. But don’t you set fire to my grass. ”
That man went scatheless through the worst of all
the Q. strikes, and his services and presence had
to be specially secured by the P.U. to save a
threatened woolshed. He went there, and the
first thing he did was to pack off all the police

A Tasmanian lady-vocalist recently fiabber-
fasted the crowded audience of a very fashionable
lobart concert by appearing in gorgeous evening-
dress, pearls, and a pair of big muddy jack-boots !
Of course the lady was wildly encored, for the
audience naturally imagined there was a lot more
to follow. The explanation proved to be that
she had borrowed “hubby’s” big clod-hoppers
to walk to the Town-hall in—the night was very
wet—and had forgotten to change them !

At Collingwood (Vic.) Police-court, the
other day, they suddenly found that the accused
person in the dock had a 21b. piece of road-
metal in each hand and was just taking aim
with one of these formidable “ gibbers ” at
the witness then giving evidence. The two
rocks were promptly taken from him,
whereupon he broke down and screamed
for his mother. Evidently they conduct
things in rather a loose fashion at
Collingwood when an accused is
allowed to take road-metal into
the dock with him, and the pity
is that he didn’t let fly with it at
the unpaid magistracy on the
bench. The Melbourne
magistracy badly wants
something or almost any-
thing to happen to it, and
a large “ gibber ” on the
head would do about as
well as a lot of other
things.

A quack advertising
in the S.M. Herald
announces himself as an
“ Egyptian Revealer

himself as an agricul-

hermetical graphoscope,
and probably his clients
would never know the
difference.
The moral of Jumbo, the late rogue-
elephant of Sydney Zoo., who departed his life
the other day full of years, rotten fruit, and
slavery. Eight years ago he tried to tusk and
trample a committeeman, his chief surface-fault
being that he failed. Had he been a mole-
skinned man, the Botany Bay Government
would greedily have got Nosey Bob to break
his neck ; but being a valuable asset —being pro-
putty—of the said 8.8. Govt., he remained an
honored exhibit. “His heart weighed 271 b.”
Fancy a thing with a heart like that enduring the
scorn of every grinning lout, being the butt of
every practical joker, and the especial slave
of ugly, undersized, underminded manhood ?
Wonder he didn’t jelly a crowd to death at nostal-
gic times ! Wonder, too, what Mumbo has got
the soul of Jumbo? Also, if “ the eye is the index
of the mind,’’ what sized mind has the ordinary
pig’s-eyed elephant got ?
A piece of picturesque bad luck 1 Out at
Cobar, on a recent sultry night, four young men
went to a tank to swim. After the swim they
commenced skylarking and got separated. Two
of them were seized with the idea that the smooth
grass was a good place for a race, and started to
sprint in the darkness. About the same moment
the other two, some distance off, had the same
idea and started to do likewise. In each case it
was a neek-and-neck race. There were, roughly
speaking, 400 square miles of empty land to sprint
in, yet they contrived to keep such an accurate
bee-line that the first information they got of each
other’s doings came in the shape of a fourfold
collision, and all four went down insensible on the
grass. After a while one of them sat up and took
stock of the disaster. It panned out one man with
a crippled arm and a bad shock; one with a
damaged leg, six cuts, sundry bruises, and a
shock; one man with slight concussion of the
brain ; and one with his forehead smashed in ap-
parently beyond repair. Moral: never run in the
dark, unless you have a whole continent to your-
self to do it in.

The troubles of a married sea-steward
lately pointed a moral in a suburban court. His
ma-in-law kept his wife-in-law secluded every
time he had leave ashore. Whereupon he shut
off the supplies. “ Check.” Wife interposes an
application for a maintenance-order for herself
and child. “ Counter-check.” Hubby his tale
unfolds, and the beak—a married man himself—
advises the pair to go and live together at more
than “a kmght’s-move ” from the ma. “ Double-
check.” Ma takes the infant son and heir!
“ Mate.” So soon has the New Woman produced
the New Mother-in-law.

Dear Bulletin, —The experiment of graft-
ing the epidermis on humans has proved emin-
ently successful, and herein, I think, lies the only
solution of the ever-aggravating unemployed
problem. Upon the bodies of the workless thou-
sands let there be grafted sheepskins of the best
quality, and thereby they would be furnished for
life with reliable clothing and turned at the same
time into a source of revenue. They could be
fixed up either as merinoes or crossbreds, but I
think the merino unemployed would be most
profitable, as there is no present idea of eating the
animal when he grows old. A good merino who
didn’t drink and consequently lose the value
of his wool in police-court fines or get his
fleece damaged in free fights should be a profitable
spec, for forty years. The unemployed could
either form co-operative settlements and shear
each other, getting an advance on themselves
from the bank to supply the necessary capital to
start with, or they could let themselves out to
squatters. The advantages which they would
have over the ordinary sheep are obvious They
would require no dogs to round them up, and a
great saving of dog would thus be effected.
They would shear each other, which the sheep
(on do ‘ between shearing times they could
? ro P s f° r their own support, and pursue
mi g atlon works, while the sheep only stands
roun /• ’ a r so ’ . e.Y could look after cattle and thus
I ?, e wo u'dustries, whereas the sheep doesn t
oo alter anything. I erhaps the best idea, how-
ever, would be to graft wool on everybody ; when
C ° U ' ! >e a s , iee P and , wo , r c . lll a boot-factory
a t the same time he would obviously be a most
profitable spec. The wool off prisoners, girls in
reformatories, members of Parliament, and civil
servants could be sold by the State, and the pro-
ceeds put into a special fund for the e- ’ t! re-
duction of the public debt. —Yours, &e., Merino.

Tho Australian Widows’ Fund presents a report
(or the year ended 81st October, 1895, which has some
good features about it, and some other features. The
income from renewal premiums is £139,208, which is
£6OOO legg than last year and £13,000 less than the year
before. The income from new premiums is £12,030, which
is £2OOO more than last year. The total income for the
year is £206,800, which is £BOOO less than last year, and
£14,000 less than in ’93. Most life-assurance societies,
however, are suffering a very similar falling-off just now.
The funds have been increased by £60,719, whereas last
year the amount saved was £84,202, and in ’93 it was
£100,783, so in this matter things are not improving. The
worst falling - off, however, is in the rate of interest
realised on investments. In ’92 it was over 5| per cent.
It dropped to 5) in ’93, and to about 5 per cent, in ’94,
and this year it has gone down with a shock to a little
over 4J. The assurance-funds now reach the handsome
total of £1,251,266, but in ’93, when the funds were
£245,000 less, the income realised from them was £2600
more. These figures show that a lot of the glory and
dazzle have gone out of the life-assurance business of
recent years. The utterly objectionable feature, how-
ever, in the Widows' Fund accounts, is the expenses,
which are _ increasing at a truly dreadful rate just
as business is diminishing and interest growing smaller.
In ’93 the expenses swallowed up nearly 22 per cent, of
the premiums. In 1894 they amounted to over 23) per
cent., and in ’95 they are within a very small fraction of
27 per cent. The common explanation given in such
cases is that the increase is owing to the expansion of
new business, as new business is necessarily much more
expensive than renewals. In this case, as the renewal
business is less than last year, the increased expense must
be set down to the cost of new business, and on that
basis the Widows’ Fund has earned £2OOO more in new
premiums and spent over £4OOO more in expenses to do it.
Every separate item of expense shows an increase, and
the society badly wants to sit down in a secluded spot and
ask itself seriously how long this process can go on.
Intense competition has doubtless a lot to do with the
matter, but some societies, at all events, have contrived
to reduce expenses, despite the hardness of the times.
• * * *
One good feature of the Widows’ Fund balance-
sheet is that the death-claims are smaller than last year,
which shows that the society has a healthy anu well-
selected crowd of customers. Another is that the funds
seem, on the whole, to be well-invested so far as any
judgment can be formed from the information avail-
able, There are no shady-looking items on the list of
assets. The amount set down for “ properties acquired
by foreclosure ” is only £24,415, which is very moderate,
and the interest in arrear is returned at the low figure of
£2149. Interest in arrear, when it gets to a large
amount, generally means that a lot of the owners of pro-
perties mortgaged would rather the society foreclosed
than not, the properties being not worth redeeming at
the price, and when this item is low it usually signifies
that the investments are in a good condition.
• * * •
The second mass of awful revelations re the
dead City of Melbourne Bank has now arrived. It is
mainly to the effect that from 1891 onwards the weak
little institution was a living lie. The bank never faced
its losses ; it bolstered up insolvent customers to prevent
them filing their schedules and compelling their bad
debts to be formally acknowledged ; and, as it never
admitted that its advances were bad, it debited them with
interest and put down the interest as profit. In one half-
year of ’93, £32,286 of the alleged earnings were bogus,
being made up by charging interest which could never be
recovered on money that was hopelessly lost. Big
advances, muddle, neglect, and a lot of Worse things
ruined the City of Melb. Bank. It was a small concern
at the best, and it lent £1,563,000 on 10 accounts—an
average of £156,000 each. Directors lent themselves
£76,000, and they lent a late manager £75,000 ; and they
also lent to six companies in which they were interested,
£542,000. The committee of alleged inspection never
discovered these awful doings, or at least it said nothing
about them, and the auditors passed them each half-year
in dead silence. It is added that some even worse dis-
coveries have been made which are withheld for the
•present.
Tho moral of this is that the whole system of
audit is a ridiculous farce. In almost every bank and
insurance office in Australasia the auditors only profess
to guarantee that the figures of the balance-sheet are
correct in a strictly technical sense. The sheet says that
the securities and advances are so much, and the auditors
add them up and report that they are so much. In
hardly one instance do they profess to say that the
securities are good, and that the advances are recoverable
—they merely announce truthfully that they have added
up the pile of rubbish or otherwise, and that the total is
as alleged. They are not asked to do anything more.
Their appointment lies to a great extent with the
directors whom they are supposed to supervise; the
board’s own shares, and its friends’ Shares, and its proxies
and its friends’ proxies, and its influence generally, being
sufficient, in most cases, to decide who shall be appointed.
If there is anything to conceal the board secures the
appointment of men who can be relied upon to say nothing
about it; and as the average auditor’s bread and cheese
depend to a great extent on his saying nothing about it,
this kind of auditor can be found almost anywhere.
There is hardly an auditor’s certificate attached to the
balance-sheet of any important Australasian concern
which even professes to be worth the paper it is written
upon. ■£'"
• • * *
The balance-sheet of the Commercial Bank of
Australia is a pathetic evidence of hard times, and is the
worst dooument that concern has issued since its recon-
struction. The net profit for the half-year is exactly
£lOBO, or less than Is. 2d. per cent, per ann um on the paid-
up capital. Last half-year the profit was £5048 ; for the
six months ended Dec., '94, it was £13,353; the half ended
June, ’94, showed a profit of £7902, and at Deo., ’93, the
figure was £29,754. The £lOBO announced this time is as
nearly as possible the irreducible minimum. During the
past half-year the cash on hand has increased by over
£200,000, but still it only amounts to £1,174,338, which is
very moderate indeed for a concern of such magnitude,
and is nearly £200,000 less than it had two years ago, so that
the Commercial has practically made no progress towards
accumulating money to meet its reconstructed deposits.
During these two years its paid-up capital has increased by
£600,000, but apparently this money has all gone out
again in some shape or another. Another liquid asset,
“municipal and other debentures,” has decreased in the
two years by £61,000. Since the bank first began to
show its reconstructed deposits as a separate item, 18
months ago, it has reduced them by a little over £400,000,
and it has still £5,773,000 to repay. The reduction saves
it £lB,OOO a year in interest, but this big saving hasn’t
served in the least to avert the downward movement in
the profits. Also, a considerable amount of progress is
said to have been made at realising the old assets,
£1,600,000 having been wiped off the assets-realisation
account in two years, but any saving that has been made
in this way seems also to have gone into the abyss of
general depreciation. Even of the miserable £lOBO which
represents the half-year’s profit, all except £7 has been
made by further grinding down the expenses, and a good
part of every other half-year’s returns since ’93 has been
made the same way. The gross profits are barely £50,000,
whereas two years ago they were over £90,000, and the
falling-off has been continuous.
If the next half-year shows the same continuous
decline as the two last, the obvious fact is that the Com-
mercial Bank of Australia can’t pay the 4) per cent,
interest on its reconstructed deposits any longer
out of current profits. The big institution, by the
way, converted a large portion of its deposits into
preference shares, which now receive no dividend, so it
is really only called upon to pay about 3) per cent, on the
total of its old deposits, but even this it can’t possibly do
out of profits—should the process of depreciation go on
for another six months at the present rate. . Its cash
balance of less than £1,200,000 has to be set against
£1,700,000 of new liabilities, and for a concern of such
magnitude it doesn’t leave nmch margin for paying off
any part of the reconstructed funds, in order to reduce
the interest thereon. And when it is remembered that
the Commercial, which has just earned £lOBO for the
half-year, needs to earn £93,880 before it can pay a 5 per
cent, dividend, the shareholders’ prospects look too
dreadful for language.
A small side-issue in the Commercial Bank’s
accounts is that the process of liquidating the great mass
of assets taken over from the old Commercial Bank is
getting slower and slower every half-year. This may
mean a lot of things, but it certainly looks as if the insti-
tution had got through all the best and most realisable
assets with a rush, and the remaining £6,000,000 worth
were a tough lot which were being found hard to deal
with.
* * * *
The A.J.S. Bank has done a little better this
half-year than last. The profit (£25,825) shows an im-
provement of £9OO, which is something, though not very
much. A 4 per cent, dividend takes £23,353 of this, and
after putting £2OOO to reserve (making it £50,000)) there
remains £472 over. The £50,000 reserve has all been ac-
cumulated since 1893. During the past half-year the note
and bill circulation and current accounts have all in-
creased. The coin, bullion, British consols, Government
debentures, and other liquid securities are £200,000 more
than they were six months ago, and amount to £1,863,000,
and the reconstructed deposits have also been reduced in
the past half-year byabout £400,000-the A.J.S. has lately
fallen into the bad habit of muddling together the 1907
fixed deposits and the new deposits, so that the amount of
the reduction can’t be actually arrived at. But the result
seems to show that the A.J.S. is making rather better pro-
gress, and has an improved outlook for the future, if the
land-tax doesn’t come down with too big a shock on its
great mass of landed securities.

The Queensland National Bank’s report is
chiefly remarkable, as usual, for the things which are not
in it. The profits for the half-year are set down at
£36,340, and, after paying the usual 3 percent, div. there
is £593 to the good. This has been arrived at mainly by
vigorous paring-down of expenses. There still appears to
Vie no attempt to build up a reserve-fund. The coin on
hand has diminished by £476,000 in six months and now
stands at £921,318. No remark is yet made about "any
attempt to release the deposits, and, as the balance-sheet
doesn't show how much the old fixed deposits amount to,
it is impossible to discover anything about them,
or to say whether the Q.N.B. gets any new de-
posits these times as a sign of public confidence,
or whether they are all Govt, money, and the recon-
structed cash of the public which remains in because the
public can't get it out. There is also no news as to how
those assets which were unrealisable at the time of the re-
construction are turning out, or what progress, if any,
has been made with the liquidation ; anyhow, the total
absence of any attempt to build up a reserve doesn’t look
as if any serious effort was being made to get ready for
repayment. The public opinion of the institution is set
forth in the fact that the last-recorded sale of shares (£5
paid up) was, so far as Tim Bullktin knows, made, some
four months ago, at Bs. 4d., at which price they would
yield 36 per cent, dividends to the investor.

The City Bank of Sydney has a profit for the
half-year just ended of £10,019 10s. sd. and as the 5 per
cent, dividend uses up the £lO,OOO, the £l9 10s. sd. goes
to strengthen the position of the bank. The most remark-
able thing about the City Bank is the consistently small
amount of the balance left over. In July, ’95, it paid a 5
per cent, dividend with £3O 9s. 3d. over, and in January
it paid the same div. and had £4 9s. 2d. left. There is
nothing else of a very surprising character in the ac-
counts. The deposits have declined by £32,000. The
cash on hand has diminished by £34,000, and the advances
have increased a little. Compared with things as they
were two years ago the reserve fund has been reduced by
£119,000, or more than one-half, and the amount at credit
of profit and loss has declined by £9O, some small sums
having been taken out of it to pay dividends with in the
old 6 per cent. days. There is no present prospect of any
attempt to reinstate the sorely diminished reserve. The
item “ bankpreniisesand furniture” has increased slightly,
but the City Bank’s premises and furniture have appeared
as a bigger item in each balance-sheet for a considerable
time past. Also, the sheet, as usual, contains as little
information as can well be put into such a document. It
doesn’t even show the amount of working expenses.
* * * *
The Commercial Banking Co. of Sydney has
put up another excellent record. During ’95, £6,000,000
of deposits have been set free, yet the cash on hand has
increased largely instead of diminishing, as might have
been expected, and now stands £2,500,000 with
£455,000 of Govt, securities to hack it up. The half-year’s
profits (£39,474) are larger than those for last half; note-
circulation and deposits have increased, and the reserve
stands at £1,010,000. An 8 per cent, dividend is declared.
The two secrets of the success of the Commercial of
Sydney are that it was moderate in its dividends in good
times, and accumulated a large reserve, and that it put a
strict limit on the amount to be advanced on any single
security. Most small banks, at all events, that have burst
have been killed mainly by lending a huge lump of their
capital to one customer; and one that is now alive and
doing well lived in terror for years because its whole exis-
tence then depended on the survival of an immensely
bloated and diseased person who, if he had attempted to
run after a tram-car, would have fallen down dead on the
track. He didn't run after any tram-car, as it happened,
and he lived to grow rich again and pay up his over-
draft and put tilings straight, but for a long and dreadful
period that gouty mass of meat was almost the only asset
the bank possessed.

dividend is declared •*£soo added to contingency fund;
£5OO carried to reserve, making it £12,5( 0: and £9OO is

More cablegrams continue to arrive to the effect
that the shareholders of the E.S. and A. Bank “ cordially
approve” of the proposed reduction in deposit interest.
Considering that the English shareholders simply propose
that they shall save from £30,000 to £69,000 a year off the
Australian depositor, and thereby probably avoid heavy
calls, the possibility of worse trouble, and give themselves
a chance of a dividend at the other fellow’s expense
couldn’t their cordial approval be taken for granted ? The
cordial approval of the Australian depositors would be a
lot more to the point.
Considering that the E.S. and A. Bank—now
trying to reconstruct some more—was subjected to a
rigid British audit at the time of its first reconstruction,
and there was a bowelless scrutiny of all the securities,
and everything was supposed to be written down to bed-
rock values what is the exact value of a British audit?
Castlemaine (Vic.) Brewery Co. reports another
good half-year, a great increase in the beer output, and a,
7 per cent, dividend. What an amount of accumulated
hiccough is represented in that 7 per cent. ! Tainworth
(N.S.VV.) Gas Co. pays at the rate of 10 per cent, per an.
(£500), and has £124 to carry forward. Sydney Freehold
Land, Building, and Investment Co. pays a dividend for
the half-year at the rate of about 22) per cent, per an. ,
it hasn’t enough money to pay the amount at present,
but expects that the necessary cash will come in by
February. Newcastle and Hunter River S.S. Co. pays 6
percent. ; Sydney Gas Co., 6s. per share out of a half-
year’s profit of £S2,(KM), which profit is one of the most
solid reasons yet advanced for a municipally-owned gas
supply. N.B.W. Shale and Oil Co. pays 6d. a share.

The S.M.H. now reports the return of a number
of miners who left Newcastle for Coolgardie, some time
ago. They tell a gruesome story of the number of men
hard up in Perth; of the graves they had passed of men
who had perished ; of the want of work, and of the im-
pending stampede Eastwards shortly. The consolation
they get from the Sunday boomster is that these men
struck the field at the wrong time, and that repeated
warnings had been given not to go out there before the
exemptions expire. To speak of warnings in the face of
the sensational telegrams, reports, interviews, and every
other form of news appearing in all the papers is rich.

N.S.W. Attorney-General Want lately decided
that married women living apart from their husbands
under protection orders could not hold publicans’

day. Owing to pressure, however, the Government has
conceded that, pending new legislation, the renewals will
no* be opposed.

Though the fire in Block 11 of the B.H. Pro-
prietary has involved an outlay to date of under £20,000,
the half-yearly report shows that indirectly it has been a
severe handicap. In the previous half-year, 6,233,7200 z.
silver and 19,358 tons lead had been produced ; in the
half-year ended Nov. 39, the output amounted to but
4,158,5610 z. silver and 13,711 tons lead. Yet this wasi not
all due to the fire. The output had outgrown the mine’s
legitimate capacity, and there was consequently irreclaim-
able waste of labor, material, and metal in many direc-
tions. General-manager Howell had begun to ease off
before he Lglt; and Mr. Stewart has pursued the policy
further. The remarkable feature of the half-year has
been that, though the output has been restricted con-
siderably more than had been contemplated, and though
there has been this actual outlay of £19,886 on account of
the fire, the monthly shilling div. has been maintained.
But the revenue has only just permitted it; the
net profit has amounted to £292,162, and the divs.
have absorbed £288,090, leaving only £4162 to
carry to profit and loss. But for the sustained
advance in the selling price of silver and lead
one div. must have been dropped ; if only the average
quotations for the previous half-year had been realised
the income would have been £28,510 less. There have
been savings, too, in many directions. The co. used to
be bled pitilessly' by the European refiners and metal-
dealers. Now, by extensions made during the half-year,
it deals with the whole of its bullion at its own refinery at
Port Pirie, and besides saving on the actual process of
refining, ships its metals separately, sending some of its
lead (as well as much of its silver) direct to the East. The
open quarries have now got down to good ore, so that
the average value per ton of the ore treated in this half-
year was £3 13s. 3d., as against £3 3s. lOd. in the previous
half. The open-cut work has also led to a great reduction
in the timber bill. For the June-Nov. half of 1894 it
amounted to £51,570: for the Dec.-May half of 1895 it
was £49,221. About the highest point reached was in the
first half of 1892, when £78,743 was spent in this direction.
This last half-year it was down to £13,851. The coke bill
has also been very much lowered, and not only because a
smaller quantity has been consumed.
To Nov. 30 last, the B.H. Proprietary had paid
(in nine years) 101 divs., amounting to £5,752,000; cash
bonuses amounting to £88,000; cash received in payment
for the British, £576,000 ; and shares of the nominal value
of £1,744,000 a grand total of £8,160,000. In its ten
years of existence, the co’s works have treated 2,666,908
tons ore for a product of 75,774,7430 z. silver, 291,607 tons
lead, 1782 tons antimonial lead, 15,835)0z. gold, and 2603
tons copper. The quantity of gold saved has considerably
exceeded that stated, but the refiners give no credit for
it; so that, with a small exception, the only gold credited
has been extracted from the bullion at the co’s own
refinery, which was started on a very small scale only six
years ago.
During its last half-year the B.H. Proprietary
Co. obtained an average price of 2s. 8)d. per oz. for its
fine silver and £lO Bs. Id. per ton for its lead. This was
ljd. per oz. more for silver and 10s. Id. per ton more for
lead than in the previous half. The highest prices ever
realised (the average for a half-year) were in the Mav-
Nov. half of 1890. Silver then sold at 4s. 6jd. and lead
at £l4 16s. 7d.-thanks to the American legislation. The
Proprietary Co., by the way, is now shipping refined lead
direct to America.
Capt. Paul has resigned the post of consulting
engineer of the Junction North. This is one of the out-
comes of the efforts to twist the B. H. Lode at the north
end. Paul is manager of the B.H. North ; and it is dis-
puted whether the North or the Junction North gets
most of the Junction new lode as it goes northward. As
one man couldn’t be expected to “ barrack ” on both
sides, the Junction North had to be thrown up. Phillips
manager of the Junction, is willing to take up the Junc-
tion North work, upon the strength of which announce-
ment the latter stock has hardened.

A good reef, carrying free gold, is said to have
been struck at a depth of 240 ft. at Wyalong-the lowest
level at which gold has been found on that field.
According to a London correspondent of the
Aroi's, Prof. Schnabel, having marie inquiry into Ash
croft’s sulphide process at his works, declares the dis
covery to be among the most important of the century.
It is really time something definite was known
as to the value of the Great Boulder lode at the bottom
level. Rumor says it is not only poorer than at any
other part of the mine, but that it is smaller is
it a lode at all, or a dyke formation with gold -rich’ it is
true, but in decomposed diorite and schist with a’verv
small percentage of quartz or other well-known matrix
for gold !

From London : “ Everything is quiet here, both
in African and Australian mines, but, If anything, the
Australian mining market is better than the African.
We are expecting Tower prices till after the holidays, when
things may pick up a little. Aside from the Great
Boulder, and two or three more at Hannan s, there docs
not seem any improvement in Coolgardie since we were
out there, and, some day, not far away, there must be an
awful shaking-up of old bones. It does not seem that
Menzies is anything near as good as they say. Some of
the papers here are going for Schmeisser because he
did not report favorably on that district. [How
quiet this has been kept!] Of course, as is always
the case -if the mine is worthless, blame the expert
who reports on it. From what I can learn, Schmeisser
has not reported favorably on many of the mines of
W.A. altogether. I am afraid his trip has been
a failure and a disappointment to a lot of London specu-
lators and promoters who look for big reports.” How
cheerful this news must be to the great W.A. army of
boomers who have been led to believe that the celebrated
German had described Coolgardie as the world’s boss
goldfield, and that his reports would pour millions of
foreign capital into the “ wild-cats,” which are all readied
up to receive them ! The. writer always regarded Herr
Schmeisser’s silence as suspicious. He wanted to get out
of the place alive. He saw enough of the Murchison in a
few days to satisfy him of its great richness - so the papers
put it. In mining always read the papers upside down.

The last act of the Forrest Govt, to cause univer-
sal dissatisfaction is that compelling the registration of all
transfers in Perth instead of on the fields as before. This
has evidently been done in the interests of Perth lawyers
without the least regard to the convenience of mine-
owners or buyers.
» * • •
The unanimity with which all the Coolgardie
fields asked for an' extension of the exemption period is
remarkable. Six weeks’ enforced idleness by the miners
of W.A. is a consideration. Every excuse but the right
one has been pleaded - the two principal being the want
of miners and the want of water, But it is significant
that the Boulder, Hill End, and the few other mines on
good gold have not taken advantage of the exemption.

So far, the only distinction The Bulletin can
see between W.A. gold booms and burglary is a legal
technicality.

The Queen Margaret mine, 1.0. U., has been
taken over, after his own and other examination, by
Harvey Patterson, one of the Broken Hill directors. A
co. has been privately formed, and £9OOO working-capital
put up. Simpson, formerly mine-manager at Block 14, is
in charge. His last report appearing makes it look like a
Great Boulder. It speaks of drives in 5,6, and as high as
30 oz. stuff, and estimates the stone at grass at 400 tons.

The persons who have an option on the Croesus
mine, Hannan's, have asked for an extension of time, and
got it by paying £3OOO, which, with the £2OOO already
paid, is forfeitable failing completion of purchase. The
odds are : no revival of boom in London-no sale.

Success and New Prince mine, Kurnalpi: Bat-
tery working one shift, “crushing for the London Kur-
nalpi Co. at £4 a ton.” Another proof that the water
difficulty out there is only a “ bogy.”
* * * *
A big attempt is being made to boom the
Norseman field in Adelaide, and S.A. investors, who
pretty well run the field, gave a banquet to themselves
recently. Chairman Harrold, a big Adelaide merchant,
alleged that already £lOO,OOO has been paid to Norseman
prospectors alone, and the capital invested in the field
amounts to £1,000,000. Then a mining captain, who
must be pretty hardened, said they had reefs on the field
for a length of 40 miles and 8 miles wide, and he didn’t
believe there were any wild cats there 1
• * * *
Coolgardie central lots, bought for a mere song
in the field’s early d|ys, now return from £lOOO to £l5OO
annual rentals. But it is risky property to hold, the slump
being only a matter of time.
* * * *
Croesus again. “ A discovery of rich stone has
been made in the Croesus mine. The stone is showing
phenomenally rich gold, but very fine.” Blue, green, ana
now white stone. This variety should clinch those British
buyers.

Ballarat has lost 150 adults to W.A. since the
opening of the year. Besides, many miners are tracking
for South Africa.

Prince_ Regent, Ballarat, for the six months, has
crushed 2735 tons for 10280 z., pays a 6d. div., and carries
£322 2s. Bd. forward. A fine strike of specimens and
nuggets (one going 1370 z.) in its 700 ft. level a few weeks
back materially put up the milling average.
A Derby (Vic.) farmer recently sold 12 loads
hay for £52. Last year he quitted a similar quantity for
£l4 1

£650,000 ; divs., £300,000. Reef, sto Bft. thick. Deepest
level, 1622 ft. Sinking a further 100 ft. has proved the
reef still in the shaft, th2refore the co. will not lose its
run of stone west so quickly as the 60ft. deg. underlie
i'TT ,’ a higher point, had led figurers to suppose.
Which means a good many more years’ life.

The once famous Garden Gully United, Bendigo,
which has div d nearly a million, is having a struggle to
avoid calls, and the tributors have at last got into the
mine. Co. shaft-sinking to 3000 ft., and will then open out

As The Bulletin forecasted a couple of weeks
back the “deep, deep ” Shenandoah has considerably
brightened since the “ clever ” crowd worked their knock-
out of timid sc rippers. Co. now raising good payable
stone, giving every promise of regular divs. this half.
Peculiar features of the reef are the 3 to 12ft. rolls which
make m and out for the 117 ft. risen on. Last half the
Shenandoah nulled 1632 loads for 12990 z. ; div. paid £BOO

Premier Reid’s reflections in May—Kruger
Caused My Gew-gaw ; Kaiser Created My Gran-
deur, &e.
Playford and Gillies are the only Agents-
General in England who have not been knighted.
Both have refused the bauble.
Blackwood says Phil. May does not seem
at home in Punch. As The Bulletin remarked
months ago—May and December.
George Dean’s step-father, Finch (supposed
bein Heaven), was recently forest-thinning for
N.S.W. Govt, on the Murrumbidgee.
tt A Melbourne paper remarks that Kipling
“ has raised the status of India as a place to be
born in.” Where was Thackeray born ?
Tas. Treasurer Fysh’s visiting-cards within
24 hours of his knighthood :
Hon. Sir Phillip Oakley Fysh, K.C.M.G.
Martin Treacy, Victoria’s pioneer boniface,
died at Wagga Wagga, the other day. He ran
the Daniel O’Connell Hotel, Collins-street, in 1840.
Colonel Mair, ex-Paymaster to Victorian
Police Force, has been drawing a pension of over
£4OO for upwards of 30 years. He is 93 years old.
The Sultan of Turkey, it is printed, is “a
total abstainer.” Like many other teetotallers,
he puts women, instead of whisky, into his soda-
water.
Madame Melba’s ex-friend, the Duke of
Orleans, has, it is cabled, met with an accident
“ while hunting in Italy.” What he was hunting
is not stated. Probably it was—as usual.
Bishop Harmer’s wife had a daughter on
Jan. 14. This is only extraordinary because it is
nearly 50 years since the last child was born to a
Bishop of Adelaide.
Artist Tom Roberts is engaged to marry
Miss Williamson, daughter of a former partner in
the well-known Melb. drapery firm (Craig, Wil-
liamson and Thomas).
Mrs. M‘Lean, mother of Vic. M.L.A.,
Allan M‘Lean, died the other day. She was the
first white woman to cross the Latrobe river into
North Gippsland in 1842.
The “father” of the Melbourne magis-
tracy, James Noonan, died the other day, aged 90
years. He was a member of the firm which built
the Vic. North-Eastern railway.
Of the little group present when Gov.
Hindmarsh declared S.A. a British province only
two survive: C. C. Wright, of Yankalilla, and
Mrs. Frances Merrick, settlers of —who are
both hearty still.
With the appointment of an independent
Public Service board, the drunken N.S.W. stipen-
diary magistrates should take the pledge and keep
it. Anyhow, they should refrain from being seen
very drunk in public.
Massive, metallic, strident Antoinette
Sterling is to be married again. Her intended is
a harmless and venerable Quaker, with a small
title and large means. It is indeed hard to imagine
Antoinette’s hubby anything but a Quaker.
The eminent Blake, Q.C., whose power-
ful personality made so great an impression
in Sydney, is described by those who knew the
father of the N.S.W. Constitution as being mar-
vellously like Wentworth in general appearance.
There is not a red-haired man in either of
the Vic. Houses of Legislature. There are several
whose hair has been red but has paid them the
reward which “ scarlet runners ” obtain in late
life, when their hair becomes a rich creamy white.
Howard Vernon (an Austra-
lian native, by the way) has now
been associated with the Firm’s
Comic Opera Co. for 15 years,
during which period he has only
missed one-and-a-half perform-
ances. The half was the first part
of “ Mikado ” one time in Christ-
church. Vernon overslept him-
self, after a week’s insomnia
caused by neuralgia, and arrived
at the theatre in great distress at
his remissness—which was, how-
ever, very easily forgiven. Ver-
non is another Thespian who
started his career in a church
choir. He was amongst the Scots
Church choristers 25 years or so
ago, and in church sat alongside
violinist Johann Kruse. After
that pious beginning Mr. Vernon
degenerated to minstrels, from
which he gradually ascended to
his present exalted position. His
first operatic engagement was with
Lyster. He once had serious inten-
tions of starring in Shakespeare.
It was only his tremendous success
as Bunthorne in “ Patience ” that
determined him to stick to opera.
The Tasmanian Governor
(Viscount Gormanston) simply
won’t know the local bigwigs—
so far as they are concerned, H.E.
is a perfect hedgehog tightly
rolled up. When old John
Watchorn was elected mayor,
the other day, for the third time,
he drove out to Government
House to pay his devoirs to the
Governor, and got a perfect
freezer. “ I bowed and he
bowed,” says honest John, “and
then I cleared out, while he
looked at me coldly through his
eye-glass—never even offered me
a whisky.” Which recalls the
time when Crouch, the blue-ribbonite, was Mayor
of Hobart. After the inspection of “the troops”
was concluded, on Queen’s birthday, his worship
invited a number of the most important per-
sonages to repair to the Town Hall and drink
her Majesty’s health. Of -course, they all went! —
and then the Deluge, for the “ fizz ” turned out
to be “ Vigorine,” and a' remarkably “dry”
brand, too.
Omen ! Justice Windeyer was taken on
board the American steamer, en route to Europe,
by the police-boat Nemesis.
N.S.W. Justice Stephen has returned from
Europe much improved in health. In his S.M.
Herald interview his Honor talks chiefly horse —
though the only N.S.W. Judge entitled to be
heard with respect on horsey subjects is Mr. Jus-
tice Innes.
Sir T. Gordon Sprigg, Cape Colony’s new
Premier, is a peace-in-our-time kind of individual
with strong Church leanings—the antipodes of
Cecil Rhodes. Try and imagine Joey Cook, of
the God-fearing Ministry, succeeding Damchicago
Dibbs. and you’ve got it exactly.

The Late J. J. HINCHY, the well-known
Sydney Tenor.
Speight’s return to the Vic. railways is
more likely than outsiders think, although not so
much so as the new firm of Hancock, Haddon,
and Co. think. If David Syme would only sell
the Age for twa hunder thoosand poond, and join
Nimmo in Scotia, Speight would vault in flying.
Symon, Q.C., the leading Adelaide lawyer,
got .£lOOO and costs as counsel for the Slug Hill
G.M. Co. in its litigation with the vendors.
The case was heard in Perth, and ended in a com-
promise. As Mr. Symon has a practice worth,
say, =65000 a year, no wonder he shirks Parlia-
ment.
The appointment of Statistician Coghlan,
himself a civil engineer by profession, as a N.S.W.
public service commissioner, is very acceptable to
the professional section of the service, which in
the past has often found itself treated with scant
consideration as compared with the merely clerical
division.
N.S.W. Premier Reid : “I joined the
Highland Society because I’m a Lowlander.”
Most members of it joined it because they were
thirsty. The writer knows one ex-member of a
branch whose father was Irish, mother English,
and who was himself born in India; and yet
passed on the lines that his grandfather was born
in Glasgow ! That humorist also joined a Hiber-
nian association, and only just failed getting into
a “ Lancashire club ” !
HOWARD VERNON, as Ko-Ko, in “ Mikado.

The endeavor to educate people into
pronouncing Gov. Brassey’s name “ Bracey,” has
failed absolutely. Only those “ who know, you
know,” do it now. People generally won’t have it
at any price. B-r-a-s-s, they say, spells Brass, and
e-y spells ey, and the name is Brassey without any
frills. Practically the propah pronunciation has
gone out, and His Ex. answers to the common
pronunciation most docilely.
JRe Ned Kelly’s baptism. Dean O’Hea
heard Red Kelly, living somewhere about the
Victorian Donnybrook, had a baby, but wouldn’t
have it christened. So the good Dane buggied
out and insisted on having the little candidate for
the kingdom of heaven brought forth and holy
watered.
Youl, the comic coroner, declares that an
alleged Chinese doctor, who fell dead in Melb.
recently, was really an Irishman with a sham pig-
tail. The Bulletin long ago predicted the day
when Europeans would have to masquerade as
Chinamen in order to be able to make a living in
Australia.
The Earl of Yarmouth is not at Rock-
hampton, but at the “Rocks,” a riverside mansion
near Mackay. There he spends his time and
expends his intellect in growing mangoes and hen-
fruit, and sells the proceeds. A more respectable
vocation than waving his hind leg to please the
female bigwigs of Melbourne.
At the time of the Beatrice-Battenberg
marriage everyone knew that Her Gracious dis-
countenanced the match. Beatrice, so runs the
tale, did not dare to tell her mother of her engage-
ment till some weeks after it was accomplished ;
then the old lady was offended, and would not
speak to her daughter for a week. “So sly of
Beatrice, ” she is recorded to have said.
Will Champion, in his coming criminal-
libel fight, keep up the good old English tradi-
tional claim that the jury is all-important in
deciding criminal libels —that the question of
libel or no-libel is wholly for the jury, no matter
how the Judge directs even in the matters of law ?
Fox’s Libel Act was passed to accentuate this
position, but Judges kick sullenly against it still.
Mr. Frank Hutchinson, bosom friend of
the late Plain Bill Dailey, and once very widely
known as a Sydney journalist, who has been
chosen to edit the new official N.S.W. Handbook,
has been little heard of during late years. In
days of yore his daily “ Town Talk ” column in
the Evening News was famous, as indeed it
deserved to be.
Melb. demise : Horatio Beauchamp, the
straight-as-a-die business-man, and Knight of the
Hammer, in the days of Stubbs, Tennent, Easey,
Fraser, Cohen, Gemmell, Lyons. Partnered one
time with Byrne, another with Rocke. A genuine
philanthropist, with a fanatic-hatred of the clergy.
He got up the Juvenile Traders’ Home and School,
which occupied a two-storeyed place, comer of
Russell-street and Flinders lane, and did a lot of
good.
The Bulletin prints the latest
photo, of Maoriland Premier Seddon,
which all who have seen the sturdy West
Coaster must vote the “ best yet.”
“ King Dick ” is here seen with his
chest right out and his “ boss ” look on
his frontispiece. From the very beginning
of R.J.’s years of discretion he ! s had
to go “on his own,” and with a clear
brain in his big head and good under-
standings beneath him, he has put his
foot down firmly wherever he has located.
Coming out to the golden West Coast in
his 20th year, he found that place adapted
to his constitution. The chief sport of
Kumara district was fisticuffs, and the
chief professor thereof an Irishman who
had wiped out all comers. Dick Seddon,
a stayer but not a “ scientist,” wiped out
that Irishman, after 20 lovely rounds,
and has been respected ever since ; also,
he has ever since been known as “Kumara
Dick.” That incident gave Seddon a big
start, but he was quicker with his fist
than his tongue. In those days, however
incredible it may now sound, he was as
slow of speech as Aaron. But by dili-
gent study he acquired a greater know-
ledge of words, and later on came into
public life as a member of the Road
Board, then into the County Council,
and eventually into Parliament, where
he talked to such purpose that John Bal-
lance chose him as Minister for Mines
and Works. In consideration of the way
he licked the Kumara Irishman, he was
also made Minister of Defence, and when
his leader died the Premiership fell to
Seddon. Although the women of M.L.
declare that Premier Seddon’s greatest
deed was advising the Governor to
sign the Act extending the franchise
to women, he will longest be remembered as
the man who squashed the great Midland Railway
swindle, rescued 6,000,000 acres of public lands
from that soulless corporation, and ended the
biggest incubus which has weighed upon the pro-
vince for years. When Seddon seized the Mid-
land line he was commonly supposed to have done
a ruinous and suicidal act, but the result of the
arbitration showed that he knew more law than
most of his critics, and was the one man in Maori-
land with courage enough for a great emergency.
At Maryborough, Q., long ago, a man
accused of horse-stealing challenged Mayor Booker
when the latter was called as a juror. Booker
was angry, and as prisoner had exceeded his right
of unquestioned challenge, he was called on to
show cause. “ This being a horse-stealing case,”
said lawyer M‘Devitt, who defended, “we don’t
care about a mare being on the jury.”
The diplomatic Reid ! Of the newly-
appointed N.S.W. Public Service Commission,
Mr. Coghlan is of Irish extraction, Commissioner
Wilson of Scotch, and Commissioner Barling, Eng-
lish. By the way, the list of Commissioners is
not, by any means, so Parkesian as many people
expected it to be. And the story goes that the
Premier had so many applications from M’sP. and
ex-M’sP. for Commissionerships that he (very
sensibly) decided to appoint nobody with a
political history.
"H. : “ A few skeins in the character of the
German Emperor. He hates England. With his
withered hand he is like crook-back Richard, re-
flecting on one branch of his parentage—not to say
he has any animosity to his mother, but he sees
the wisdom of the then young Bismarck, who
opposed the marriage. He imbibed his hatred of
England from Bismarck, and retained it when he
determined to be his own Bismarck.”
Rev. F. B. Boyce, a Sydney teetotal apostle,
says Queen Victoria has described strong drink
as “a great curse.” The old lady takes some of
the curse (Lochnagar is the brand) every night.
Old N.S.W. ex-Chief-Justice Stephen also des-
cribed strong drink as “a curse ” —and yet used
lovingly to hold up a glass of his favorite tipple
(red wine) to the light and ask his' Visitors to
admire its lovely color.
Col. Cameron, maternal grandfather of
Premier Charles Cameron Kingston, eloped with
Ludivina da Silva, daughter of a Spanish grandee,
during the first Peninsular war. The Colonel was
stationed in Sydney when old Sir George Kingston
married his daughter. This little family history
sets forth the S.A. Premier’s claim to have Scotch,
Spanish, Irish, and Australian blood in his veins,
for he was bom in Adelaide.
One Christopher Snowdon, of South St.
Kilda (Vic.), has applied at Sydney Patent Office
to protect “An apparatus usable either as a race
starting-machine, as a clothes-line, a combined
elevator and overhead conveyer, and a self-closing
gate for such as railway-crossings.” The next
invention may be a combination infant’s feeding-
bottle and tram-motor, convertible into a 40-acre
paddock, a street-organ, or a pair of bloomers.
Interviewed in Sydney the other day,
Albert F. Calvert, Esq., (and valet) was asked
“ whether he was the gentleman who is sometimes
described as a Westralian explorer ? ” “If I am,”
modestly replied the great man, “ I do not lay
claim to anything of the sort, but I have done a
good deal of pioneering work in that country.”
People who detest cheek are glad to notice that
Calvert (and valet) is being sent ’Ome by the
Westralian Govt, with a very large flea in his
ear.
Verbatim copy of a letter from a chief
magistrate of a certain W.A. Corporation :
Dear Sur,—On monday next lamto be made a Mare,
and shall be much obliged to you if so be as you will send
me down by the Coatch some provisions fitting for the
occasion, and I am to ax my brother the old Mare, and
the rest of the Bench.—l am, sur,” &c.
The wags tried to get the storekeeper to forward
half a bag of oafs and a “ bran mash ” for the
“ old mare,” but the business man “laid to his
book,” and sent the usual canned “ dog ” and
bottled British.
Ail endeavor is being industriously made
in Melbourne to ridicule Protection because Labor-
leader Trenwith, who is suffering from cataract, is
going to England to undergo an operation. “Why
not patronise the local doctors ? ” the Freetraders
Photo, by Wrigglesworth [?] Binns.
Premier SEDDON, of Maoriland.
are saying. The plain fact is that Trenwith
wanted to be operated on in Melbourne, but he
was advised that the voyage would do his health
good, and, apart from that, his friends thought
that a trip to England, which would bring the
Vic. labor leader into contact with the labor
leaders of the old world, would be of political
advantage to him. Davitt strongly pressed him
to visit England, and he is going largely on account
of the Irish politician’s persuasion.
Gov. Brassey’s pictures, lent to Melb.
National Gallery and Ballarat Exhibition, count
strongly in his favor. There’s little or nothing of
what Mr. Sparkler called “ bigod nonsense ” about
them. Sea pieces that depict the ocean as it is,
cornfields and green landscapes which give fair
play to the imagination, and other works of honest
art rather than insincere mannerism. The
general public can see the point of the Governor’s
pictures without having studied culchaw and the
jargon of its apostles.
The usual story has gob itself attached to
Brassey. One day when the Sunbeam was
“thrown open” to the Tasmanians, a curious
visitor, mistaking the Governor in his nautical
rig for a small officer of the boat, ranged alongside
and asked : “Is Brassey aboard ? ” “ I believe he
is,” was the reply. “ Vou might point him out
to me, old chap.” Brassey led the stranger to
the nearest mirror, and,;, pointing to his own
reflection, said placidly,. “ There, that old chap
with the grey whiskers, he’s your man.”
It is regarded in legal j; as
certain that Judge Windeyer has gone ip England
for the express purpose of engineering a Privy
Councillorship for himself— which, would enable
him, on his retirement from the Bench,
to sit in London on the hearing of Australian
appeals. The Bulletin asks 'the British press
and legal authorities to look up Mr. Windeyfer’s
record in the Mount Rennie case, and to gay
whether Mr. Windeyer is a man who should ever
be allowed to officially cast his shadow in any
court of justice.

POLITICAL
POINTS
Rumors are rife of two coming vacancies
in N.S.W. Leg. Assembly.
Albury was the first proposed Federal
capital, Wentworth the second.
Premier Reid’s jingoism is another of his
fiscal inconsistences. A big war would do more
for Australian Protection than a dozen tariffs.
Description of two parties in Bananaland
Assembly: ‘ ‘ Men of some conscience and no
ability. Men of some ability and no conscience.”
In Queensland, some candidates don’t
stand for certain districts, but certain districts
stand for some candidates —like sea-beach donkeys
awaiting riders.
Both the Cairns political candidates—
Lissner and Givens—come from the Towers. They
hadn’t a white man available at Cairns—even for
a member of Parliament.
Maoriland is the only province in Aus-
tralasia which deals fairly with each of the British
kingdoms by proclaiming public holidays on the
days sacred to St. Patrick, St. George, and St.
Andrew.
The irony of it ! Reid, Carruthers and
Co. encouraging and subsidising N.S.W. State
technical education, and, at the same time, taking
away the work which alone could render such edu-
cation profitable.
Premier Kingston (S.A.) never appears in
any case in the criminal courts whilst Attorney-
General, nor will he allow his partner to do so.
This leaves him entirely free in exercising his
functions as a Grand Jury.
The Employers’ Liability Bill still awaits
its fate in Vic. The old Act expires shortly, and,
as the Upper House will almost certainly reject
the Bill, Labor-members had better be ready with
another, on the half-a-loaf principle.
Premier Reid reserves the sand-shifting
business as far as possible for the people of N.S.W.,
but he imports his Land-tax Commissioner from
S.A. The tender care which gives the local man
all the sand-shifting is very touching.
Lady Brassey is agitating to establish in
Melbourne a Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
(o Children. After which, we presume, State-
school children will be spared the pain of singing
the Unnatural Anathema for the edification of
imported Governors.
Sydney Daily Telegraph calls it “a
gratifying national enthusiasm ” when Englishmen
shout for war, but “ rabid jingoism ” when
Yankees indulge the same extravagance; and, as
if to balance the Hemispheres, the San Francisco
Bulletin calls the English indulgence “ rabid
jingoism” and the Yankee “national enthusiasm.”
Who is the solitary

In Wesbraiia you are
still liable, if the police do
their duty, to be stopped
in the streets by an officer
if you are out after 10 p.m.,
asked your name and ad-
dress, whether “bond or
free,” and requested to ex-
plain your reasons for being
abroad at that suspicious
hour. Also, you may be
inspected all over by the
light of Robert’s lantern
so that he can identify you
again if need be. In old,
sleepy Westralia it is still
a cause for grave suspicion
to be out after ten, and
they still want to know
whether you are “bond or
free ” from sheer force of
habit. The old customs
are falling into disuse,
however, for the new
iniquities who have come
over by thousands from
the “ other side ” are a fro-
ward race who won’t go to
bed at 9.30, and who scoff
at the local policeman
when he wants to know if
they are ‘ ‘ bond ; ” and
when the officer demands
their names and addresses
he finds they are almost all
Bill and live in a tent;
and the hurry of the new
order of things sweeps the
Superannuated constable
off his feet, so to speak.
Mr. Callan has again reluctantly consented
to stand for the Fitzroy (Q.). In his speech appears
the neatly-disguised threat—thus: “He had been
caused great anxiety by the threatened closing of
the (Mt. Morgan) co’s works from scarcity of water,
but he was satisfied such a calamity might now be
averted. The co., he might say, had no intention
to reduce wages, as rumored, but would always
give a fair day’s wages for a fair day’s work. This
was away from the Subject; but he had mentioned
it to induce friendly feelings between employer
and employes.”
One of the most significant tell-tales re
the manner in which the Reid Government Party
has catspawed the N.S.W. Labor Party, is the
unblushing suppression, by Sydney D.T. —the
Reid organ—of the civil war within the N.S.W.
Political Labor Leagues, born of dissatisfaction
with the Parliamentary Labor Party. Whereas,
in respect of Reidophile questions, the D.T. con-
trives always to find three columns of space
for every two of the S.M.H., in reporting
the annual meeting of the P.E.L., the S.M.H.
gives a column to the D.T’s third. The Herald
is not tied to the chariot-wheels of Georgy-Porgey.
Since the
yearlB74there
has been a
great and con-
tinuous fall in
the prices
both of this
country’s ex-
ports and im-
ports, but the
prices of ex-
ports have fal-
len much the
faster and the
heavier of the
two. The wool
and other raw
produce which
fetched £lO2B
in London 22
years ago
realises £590
now ; while the
foreign -manu-
factured goods
which cost
£lO2B in Syd-
ney at the
same date now
cost ,£714. In
other words, a
country which
doesn’t manu-
facture for it-
self, but lives
by dragging
raw produce
out of the
ground and
sending it
away to ex-
change for
manufactured
articles, has
now, assuming values were level in ’74, to send
away 20s. worth of produce to buy 16s. 6d. worth
of foreign goods. God bless the great importing
policy !
Frank Madden is stated to be tired of
political fame, and to meditate retirement from
Parliament in favor of Wrixon. The latter tries
to be liberal, but is responsible for the flogging
and Sunday-paper-suppression Acts, which stand
always as a reproach against his capacity.
The alacrity with which men offer them-
selves as army volunteers all through the British
empire has probably more to do with the
plethora in the labor market than with
any zeal for maintaining England’s greatness.
William Pitt, in the old war days, was in the habit
of saying, when recruits came in slowly, “I’ll put
another ha’penny on the 21b. loaf, and that will
spur their loyalty. ” The hungry and unemployed
make the rank and file for kings.
THE GAMBLING CURSE.
SCHOOL-TEACHER (endeavoring to explain the meaning of the worn

In England, during 1895, 513,000 acres of
wheat-growing land was abandoned ; the local
wheat supply diminished by 2,000,000 quarters ;
and 20,000 agricultural laborers and their families
were thrown out of work. To quote the report of
the National Agricultural Union, Britain is “be-
coming more and more dependent on foreign and,
possibly, hostile countries. ”
The departure of Gov. Lamington for
Queensland has been seized by Chamberlain and
Co. as an opportunity of “ tightening the bonds ”
between England and Australia. When the
Governor arrives he will speedily discover the
opinion held by the best and brightest of young
Australians—that the best thing between England
and Australia is the ocean.
“West Australia,” says the Queenslander,
“occupies the proud and unique {position of being
a colony without politics and without a policy.
There are, therefore, no political parties, and out-
side of a very narrow circle no one cares a rap
about public affairs. Everybody minds his own
business, and as a happy result everybody seems
contented and well-off.” And the same thing,
when one comes to think of it, might have been
said about the New Testament hogs which fell
overboard in Galilee. Also, it is one of the best
descriptions ever written of a snail on a cabbage-
leaf.
A SYMPATHETIC AUDITOR.
BARD'S WIPE : “I wish you’d read your new poem to yourself — you’ve made
baby cry.”
BARD: “I assure you, my dear, there’s not one more pathetic passage."
Mr. Charles Lyne, hitherto secretary (at
£7OO a year) of N.S.W. Public Works Committee,
has been appointed secretary to N.S.W. Civil
Service Board at £6OO a year. The diplomatic
Charles, seeing that the Works Committee
mightn’t last, whereas the Public Service Board
would probably be eternal, told the Colonel not to
shoot and came down. The new Works Com-
mittee secretary will probably get about £4OO, and
will be well paid at that. The billet has, up to
date, been the fattest and easiest in the N.S.W.
service.
Now that revenue is so much wanted in so
many places, The Bulletin respectfully suggests
that the minimum fine for ordinary curse-language
should be raised to 405., and for bad curse-
language, including one very loathsome expres-
sion in particular, to £5, and that the police should
have strict instructions to seize upon every person
heard saying “blanky” in a public place and
bring him under the 40s. section. Also, that
procedure should be simplified by allowing the
arrested person to acknowledge his guilt at once
and pay the price of his curse to the inspector
at the police-station without any publicity. And
further, that the proceeds of this enactment be
kept in a separate fund to build a particular line
of railway to be known thereafter as the Blanky
Railway. The average Treasurer, when he is hard
up, simply dumps another penny on the income-
tax. What he should do is to put another pound
on the minimum fine for bad language, and order
the police to listen harder than ever for the man
who says “blanky ” in public places, and to run
him in remorselessly.
Will some democratic M.L.A., when Par-
liament meets, move for a complete return of the
number of people whom the present Government
shoved into the N.S.W. public service during the
18 months or so that it has been in office, and
whom it was shoving in almost up to the last hour
before the political patronage era came to an end ’
Also, as Premier Reid has shown that he can’t be
trusted to tell the wholly unvarnished truth in
such matters ( vide the shamelessly garbled state-
ment of Dibbs’s political appointments which he
presented to the Assembly some time ago) will
that member also suggest that the Civil Ser-
vice Commissioners supply the return ? Further
it would be interesting to know how many soli-
citors who have been struck off the rolls for
disgraceful conduct the Government h*s provided
witj temporary or other billets at good salaries
And, lastly, the public wants to hear about a
recent case m which a hopelessly useless dude was
sent down to a public office to be employed at a
big wage, and how he was returned by the boss on
the ground that there was no work for him t-r. j
and he couldn’t do it if there was any ; and aboS

The “ special conditions ” now inserted in
N.S.W. Govt, contracts set forth that “if it shall
be represented to the Secretary for Public Works
that an undue number of men are being employed
by the contractor who have not been domiciled in
this province for six months previously to such
employment, and such allegation be proved to his
satisfaction, the Minister shall have power to cau
on the contractor to discharge any or all such
men,”&c. The Minister, it will be observed, is
the sole judge of what constitutes an undue num-
ber, and he may prohibit the contractor employing
any men from other provinces. How is this for
Free trade and a beautiful F ederal spirit ?
A well-known Sydney grocer of the
Foreign-trade persuasion publishes what purports
to be the cost of a week’s groceries to one of his
clients under the old tariff and under the new one.
Said list shows that sugar, condensed milk, pre-
served fish, rice, cornflour and salt fish have gone
down a whole lot in price owing to. the new tariff
—which tariff, strange to say, levies exactly the
same duties on these goods as before. Also, there
has been a big drop in sago owing to the present
enlightened Government taking the duty off,
which is still more remarkable, as there was no
duty on. And this production is headed “ a
good significance of the advantages of Freetrade.
Great Scott!
Cardinal Moran’s proposal to form an Irish
volunteer regiment in Sydney carries us back to
1879, when a Tory Home Ruler, the late King-
Harman, endeavored to extend the volunteer
movement to Ireland. The bill was hailed with
acclamation, for, in this respect, Ireland labors
under a genuine grievance. But in the Lords, one
of those individuals—rare even among Irishmen —
who knew Ireland, the Earl of Inehiquin (Smith
O’Brien’s brother), opposed it so stoutly as to
secure its rejection. A few months after the
Land League war started, and when the finest
peasantry in the world was potting landlords,
bailiffs and agents with obsolete blunderbusses,
J. Bull thanked Heaven that he had barely
escaped sending them Govt, rifles of the latest
brand.
At Sydney the week before last J. H.
Hellings (N.S.W.) won the 100 and 220yds. Aus-
tralasian swimming championships from N.S.W.,
Vic. and M.L. competitors. He deserves special
recognition because he is, in the strictest sense, an
amateur. His 220yds. win was the sensation of
the carnival, for the finish by which he beat
Gormly was a great exhibition of gameness.
Gormly, himself a man of rare pluck, remarked
immediately afterwards: “I was sure I had him
beaten ; fifteen yards from home I was a length
ahead. It all only proves what I have always
said—that Jack’s never beaten till the numbers
go up.” One feature of Hellings’s win is that he
beat A. Cavill, the champion 100yds. and 220yds.

All hands have been discharged from Bunker’s
Hill, being replaced by a selected staff from the Thames.
Coromandelites are confident that with deeper sinking
the Hauraki golden lode will be brought to light. This

make the prediction good. Bunker’s at latest were at
6s. 6d.
Waiotahi private claim, Thames, is a steady
gold-producer. For the past 25 years the same share-
holders and staff have run the mine, and the regular
monthly return has been 200 oz. and over. The greedy
practice of picking the eyes out of the property has not
been adopted—on the contrary, the ground has been
systematically opened out and* several payable leaders
exposed, giving moderate but certain divs. If other
mines followed suit the whine for John Bull’s capital
would not be heard so often, and the best ground would
not be held in London as is the case now.

The latest is a secret partnership between a (say)
big-hotel manager and a labor-agency. A. applies to 8.,
labor-agent, for a billet as cook. “ Well,” says 8., “ I've
got the very thing for you. A capital vacancy at X.’s
hotel, £3 per week. You're the very man for it, and I’ve
got the giving of it away. But billets such as that don’t
go begging every day, and I must have a special bonus
from the man who gets it. I think that’s only fair.”
“ Well, what bonus do you ask?” (Here follows a demand
actually made by a S.A. labor-agent in re a billet at £3 a
week.) “ Well, supposing you get the billet, just from
week to week, without any agreement, but just taking
your chance, I want one week’s wages, £3. If I get
you a three-months’ agreement (that will stand you
m, say, £4O), I want £l5; if a six-months' agreement
I want £25; and, fora 12-months’ agreement, £3O is my
fee.” 1!! Mind you, the official-registration fee of 5s
had previously been paid ! The writer’s informant took
the billet “ from week to week,” and paid the
labor-agency extortioner £3. At the end of the
first week, he was told that there were “no
wages" for him, as the hotel-manager understood that
the first week's wages were to go to the labor-agent. “ But
I paid him £3.” “What? Paid him in advance? Just
wait a minute.” (Goes to telephone. Comes back.]
“Oh, yes; it’s all right; here's your wages.” Another
week slipped by, and then the employe got “ a week’s
notice,” on the broad ground that he “ didn’t suit.” Yet
the manager gave him an excellent “ reference.” From
enquiries made, it was found that the hotel was always
changing its cooks, its waiters, its barmen, its barmaids,
its pantrymen, and even its boots ! The solution? The
manager was “ halves” with the labor-agent!
At the end of ’B5 the S.A. Savings Bank had

Now that there is more money lost than made
over “pubs.,” brewers and liquor-houses are turning
their attention to groceries holding grog-licenses. The
wine and spirit houses are first in the field, and in one pro-
vince they have bought several grocery-groggeries that
have faced their creditors. Bung simply puts in his
nominee, who makes a pretence of being a legitimate
grocer by carrying a very small stock in that line, whilst
the bottle-trade is pushed vigorously by house-to-house
canvass. Bung gets weekly settlements from his man,
and runs no risks of moonlight flits as in the old days.
No monetary advances are necessary, neither are bills-of-
sale, and the principles of J. Barleycorn are diffused
throughout hundreds of households by means of whisky
charged in the bill as tea and sugar.

Apropos the bung-trade, in some of the Aus-
tralias a third conviction for Sunday trading means the
cancellation of the license, so far as the licencee
is concerned. But a relative of the offender
simply takes up the running, gets a license, and in his
turn shares the fate of his predecessor, who then puts in
yet another relative, and so on until at last a distant con-
nection of his wife, fifty times removed, acts as his nomi-
nee. But this seldom happens, as the police “ sling ” the
job and come to terms. Remedy :To cancel the license
of the house.

Barrington, in his “ History of Australia,” states that
the convicts chietly used the first Sydney theatre, opened
on 16th January, 17d6—just 100 years ago -to “ spot ”

residences. Possibly the necessity of something to take
p jople away from their homes actually caused those lays

Dear Bulletin,— Mrs. Brough states to your inter-
v:ewer, as an instance of the difference between Vic. and
N S.VV. tastes, that “Sophia” ran but three weeks in
M lbourne, whereas it went for six in Sydney. The history
o. “ Sophia’s ” Melbourne season aforesaid would probably
explain why it only lasted three weeks. I have some
recollection of changes in the cast which affected one or
more productions of Buchanan’s play.— Yarra Yarra.
A pleasing feature in the Sydney panto, as compared
with both Melbourne productions is the paucity of Jin-
goistic gags, with which the Southern shows fairly bristle.
Another feature, still more pleasing, is that these puerile
threats are received in Sydney with marked apathy, while
in Melbourne they are cheered to the echo. The avowed
intention of wiping the floor with the British by means of
the next Auitrdian Eleven excites a real solid ovation at
the Sydney theatre, while the reference to nigger-butcher
Jameson as a hero is received with a shout of scorn by the
gallery.
There are few males in the Pollard Opera Co. Manager
“ Tom ” contents himself with male comedians only, and
assigns light tenor and baritone roles to the girls. He
knows the tenor Lothario, and' will have none of him.
Also, the public somehow prefers its Lothario to be a
shapely soprano.
“ Good taste must be the music-hall guide nowadays,”
Harry Kickards virtuously informs a Melb. interviewer,
and then you go and see Henry in the evening, cavorting
in petticoats, ami singing a blue song about a lady and
her medical adviser, with slabs of yellow patter let in,
and you understand that tastes differ.
R. S. Smythe was the first acting-manager of Melb.
Opera House. He has a pet anecdote of the first night.
The building (not the present structure) was not unite
completed, and the then not-much-travelled was hanging
about below, keeping an eye on the pay-box, when a
heavy and very dignified swell, with a tall, handsome and
austere daughter upon each arm, who had just taken
tickets for the stalls, was stopped by an attendant making
for the pit-door. The attendant directed him with a word
and a motion of the hand, and the haughty and exclusive
personage turned away like a man whose feelings have
been outraged, and, with an imperial stride, swept his
bouncing daughters into an apartment discreetly labelled,
“ Eor gentlemen only.”
“ A pitiable sight,” writes a Ballarat paper, “ was wit-
nessed at the Exhibition this morning, when the lioness
Psyche, the pet and the best-trained pupil of Mrs. Russell
(a Melb. lady, wife of a well-known dentist—who hits
adopted lion-taming as a profession), was at the point of
death, the immediate cause being inflammation of the
lungs. Mrs. Russell was found by the visitors to be sob-
bing bitterly, with the head of her favorite companion
resting upon her lap. Death occurred shortly after noon.
The distress of Mrs. Russell was most pronounced. She
purchased the animal from the management of Melb.
Zoo three years ago, when it was a ‘ kitten cub,’ and had
trained it as a household pet at her residence in Mel-
bourne, and regarded it as one of the dearest members of
the family, owing to its faithful attachment to her. The
death of the animal came quite suddenly, owing to the
varying temperature of the Exhibition building ; and the
death of Psyche came as a most painful surprise to Mrs.
Russell, whose regret is expressed in her own words : ‘ I
would willingly part with all my worldly belongings than
that Psyche should have died.’ The animal was a
splendid specimen.” Which recalls a memorable painting
shown in the foreign loan-collection at the recent Hobart
Exhibition. It was entitled “The Death of Brutus”—and
represented a lion-tamer and his wife mourning the death
of their splendid lion, whose dead body bad just been
taken from its cage. Eor some utterly inexplicable reason
this picture (by a French artist) was, though very low-
priced, allowed by the controllers of the various ‘public
galleries to return to Europe.
They have got a surprising double for Miss Florence
Young in “ Djin-Djin.” As far as appearances go, Miss
Bertha Place, who plays the Prince at matinees, is hardly
distinguishable from her prototype, and it is only her
voice which would undeceive three-quarters of the audi-
ence.
The Quong Yick Waii Bo (Chinese Sydney newspaper)
on the pantomime at Her Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney
“To please the eyes of youth are dancing-girls with
sha. e.ier limbs than ever one dreamt of. One peculiar
object, which is new to those who have not seen these
things, is to see girls who, to the sight, are without
clothes, dancing behind the shelter of umbrellas. They
are not really naked, but the representation excites the
idea that they are so. Such things would not be allowed
to happen in China ; but we are only men, and we like to
see bare arms, bare legs, and bare bosoms, and it pleases
us to hear a pretty girl so exposed exclaim, ‘I have just
come out of a nice bath,’ making one believe that she is
quite unclothed. The pictures are just like seeing fairy-
land, or what we see in our dreams, and are well worth
the price charged to see them. Do jou wonder that
every Governor and great personage who comes to this
city should exercise bis influence to take the l>est seat in
this theatre for himself and those be favors the most! ”
By the way, what does a Chow see “ in his dreams ”?

There is some talk of “ Djin-Djin,” the phenomenally,
successful Melb. Princess panto., being offered to Hus.
Harris. As a purely Australian production and as some-
thing distinctly new in the way of pantomime, J. C. N il-
liamson is inclined to think that Sir ’Arris would catch-on
to it.
Cecil Ward, who has been over eight years with the
Brough-Boucicault Co. - he joined the co. a month prior
to Titheradge’s coming-has been a cyclist for the past 20
years. Which possibly explains that little, half-crown-
sized bald spot which is now beginning to show on the
accomplished stage-lover’s head.
Dr. Neild, the veteran Melb. medico and ex-theatrical
critic, was remarking lately to a Bulletin man that he
finds it hard to convince people of the occasional magni-
tude of show specs, in the old days. F"or instance,
Catherine Hayes was a really famous operatic “star”
w hen she came to this country, and sang to prices ranging
from 12s. for the dress-circle. Di Murska, a much more
modern instance, started on the same high terms, but
soon lowered them.
The Finn’s “Trilby” Company (opening at Melb.

At London Haymarket Albert Edward recently had

MR. DUANE, OF AUCKLAND.
We shall print the whole of Mr. Isaac Duane’s
letter, only regretting that it is not longer. He
might have mentioned that June, the month in
which he wrote, is the coldest month in the year
in his country, and January the hottest. He might
also have reminded us that New Zealand is almost
as large as Great Britain, with a much more
desirable climate. He might further have said
that it is a wholesome place to live in, as it con-
tains few physical sources of disease, and possesses
no insect so noxious as the English wasp. Yet on
reading his letter we shall find that those attractive
islands in the far Southern Sea are not free from
an enemy we are called upon to fight here in Eng-
land, as elsewhere throughout the world.
“ I have much pleasure in writing you,” says
Mr. Duane, “ as to me it is a privilege as well as
a duty to describe an experience in which I am
confident you will be interested.
“ Ever since I was a boy I have not only suffered
from indigestion in its worst form, but I have been
a martyr to it. Such success in life as I have
achieved has been in the face of the constant
opposition set up by this miserable complaint.
All its symptoms are familiar to me as the smoke
of London is to a dweller in that rather grim old
city. The bad taste in the mouth, the fitful
appetite, the distress in the stomach after eating,
the pains in the chest and back, the dull headache,
the sense of weariness and fatigue, the depression
of spirits, the want of ambition to take hold of
any labor, the weakness resulting from lack of
sufficient nourishment, &c.—all these were part
and parcel of my life from my youth to a time I
am going to speak of in a moment.
“ I can only account for it by assuming that I
must have inherited a tendency to this disease.
At all events it cast a gloom over my whole his-
tory up to the date of my recent happy deliverance.
The record of the sleepless, wretched nights I
passed would make almost a volume by itself.
Times beyond counting I have arisen from my
bed in the morning, glad the night was gone, and
yet in no frame of mind to welcome the day. To
the chronic dyspeptic rest does not bring strength
as it does to others.
“You will hardly need to be told that I made
every effort to obtain a cure. I tried medicine
after medicine—now something I thought of my-
self and then something advertised in the news-
papers. And as to doctors (against whom I desire
to say not a word), I tried one after another, and
faithfully used the prescriptions they gave me;
but nothing more than temporary relief came of it.
“ About four years ago a friend spoke to me of
the great reputation of Mother Seigel’s Syrup in
curing all ailments of the digestion, and urged me
to make a trial of it. I might as well say frankly
that I had little faith that it would do me any
good; but I was in such pain that I was in a
mood to try anything that offered the remotest
chance of a cure. So I bought a bottle, and the
very first dose made me feel better. This was so
cheering and hopeful that I continued taking the
Syrup, and to my surprise I grew better and
better until I was cured. All the symptoms which
made my life a burden for so many years are now
gone, and lam a different man. If ever, from
any cause, I have a temporary recurrence of
indigestion, a few doses of Mother Seigel’s Syrup
produce immediate relief, and leave me in good
health. You have my full consent to publish this
letter. lam well known in Auckland, and always
glad to tell anyone by word of mouth what a
wonderful cure your remedy worked in my case.
(Signed) Isaac Duane, coachbuilder, Karangahape
Road, Auckland, New Zealand, June 25th, 1895.”
Our home readers will perceive that not in
England alone but in far distant quarters of the
globe this celebrated medicine is known, and is
successful where others do not avail. It is the
most commonplace of truths that its praises are
sounded wherever civilisation extends, and almost
in every written language the name of Mother
Seigel’s Syrup finds an acknowledged place.*
Self-preservation is the first law of funk,
and the best foot-motor yet invented.
“The worst fix I was ever in,” said
Algernon, the drover (his real name was Bill, but
The Bulletin prefers to call him Algernon—for a
change), “was when I was stuck with 5000 sheep in
the middle of a salt plain six miles from a river.
We reckoned on watering them at the half-way
soak; but every drop was dried up. The sheep
looked as if they couldn’t move another yard.
What did Ido ? I rushed off to the hut-keeper
on the river-bank, put his tank on the dray, filled
it, and started back. My mate Eustace (his real
name was Jim) thought I was crazy, but I told
him to call the dogs and muster up the jumbucks,
and then I backed the cart into the mob and
opened the tank tap. Didn’t they just wake up,
tumbling over one another for a drop. But I
didn’t give ’em much time, for I whipped up the
horse, and away I rattled in the cart across the
plain with the thin stream running from the tap
and the sheep running after it. One after another
scented it, and soon the whole mob were following
at my heels, the whole 5000 all in single file. They
made a line three miles long. Some dropped out
and died, of course, but the rest kept on till we
reached the river. And the dogs soon got the
hang of the dodge : they ran up and down
like corporals with militia-men, and made ’em
keep in line. And you see the advantage of the
single file was this : they were not tumbling
over one another when they did come to the river,
but those on ahead had had enough by the time
the tail came up, and they moved away, so there
was no crowding. ’ ’
Dear Bulletin, —The Yic. Dental Act is
not really so foolish as the confusing par. referring
thereto in a recent issue. The Act provides that
any young man of 21 who has been “continuously
engaged during a period of not less than four years
in the acquirement of professional knowledge and
has passed an examination before the Board ”
shall be entitled to be registered as a dentist. Of
any new-chum who applies for registration on his
merits without passing the local exam., the Board
merely requires that he shall have practised as a
dentist for not less than ten years outside the pro-
vince. If he isn’t a foreign practitioner of ten
years’ standing, he must pass the exam. Four
years’ preparation is not too much to ask of any
young Victorian ; nor is there anything incompre-
hensible in the Board’s desire to prevent local
aspirants to dentistry from going abroad for
their education. The new Vic. Dental College
started last year is, on the authority of a
Sydney tooth-doctor who knows ’Murka well, a
better-equipped institution than can be found in
most of the States. The case you refer to was that
of a Vic. son of wealthy parents who airily
intended to evade the Act. He tripped over to
Philadelphia and returned within 33 months,
brandishing his degree and asking permission to
practise in Melb., where four years’ “ acquirement
of professional knowledge ” is indispensable to
‘ ‘ pass. ” Well, the young magnate suffers no hard-
ship. After putting in the balance of 15 months’
work, he can go before the Vic. Board for exam-
ination, and if his ’Murkan degree be a real testi-
monial to his ability he will have no difficulty in
passing. What’s the matter with the Act ? — Cum
Tree.
Dear Bulletin, — Re aboriginal (?) sten-
cilled hands. The only reason for attributing
these to an earlier race than our present aborigines
is that no aborigine yet questioned by those inte-
rested can say that he saw them being made or
ever heard of them having been made by his race.
Pity “ Creeve Roe ” does not look into some of the
scanty literature on the subject or Carefully
examine some of the imprints before suggesting
that the hands were stamped on in blood. The
hand of the primitive artist (and foot, too, for the
writer knows of stencilled feet) was placed on a
smoke-begrimed cave wall and then stencilled
round with a watery whitish-grey pigment, or the
same pigment in a powdered state on a previously-
dampened or oiled cave surface —the wet stencilling
lasted better. Caves in Wollombi district show
the splashes made with a wet pigment. Some of
this the writer has just as the cave-painter left
it—it comes from Yanco Creek, near Wollombi.
These black hands fade rapidly on being cut out of
a cave and exposed to sunlight and weathering.
Whether the custom had any tribal, religious, or
mythical significance yet remains to be seen—the
writer’s opinion is that of a black he questioned :
“Long time ago, plenty old-feller blackfeller,
plenty play about there when it wet.” Does
any Bulletin reader know of these hands else-
where than in caves of the Hawkesbury sandstone,
or in caves which face other than from E.N.E.
round to W.N.W. (approximately)?— Mindoo-

=—Buchn Bitters.
BARON BERZILIUS’ REPORT.
They are chiefly given in complaints of the Urinary
Organs, such as Gravel, Chronic Catarrh, morbid Irrita-
tion of the Bladder and Urethra, Diseases of the Prostrate
Glands, and Retention or Inconvenience of Urine, from
tiie loss of tone in the parts concerned in its evacuation.
These Bitters I also recommend in Dyspepsia, in Chronic
Rheumatism and Cutaneous affections. The action of
Buchu on the human frame is more effectual on all
diseases of the Kidneys and Bladder than any other herbal
plant; and it also assists persons suffering from Skin
Diseases, causing a healthy action of the secretions and
inducing perspiration.
Read what Medical men say about them—
BJERKIN, M.D. The Bitter is pure, and not like
others in overdoses. It has a remarkable influence on the
liver, promoting the secretions of Bile, and correcting it
when deranged, and restores healthy evacuations in oases
of habitual costiveness.
D. ECKSTROM, M.D.—BBBB—I find these Bitters a
most valuable and wholesome tonic, being pure and
strengthening; a stimulant to the liver, assisting diges-
tion. I therefore thus recommend them.
G. B. WOOD, M.D.—lt is the purest of Bitters, and
exerts a peculiar influence over the liver.
Row’s Steane’s Bitters.
STUDY HEALTH BY TAKING ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS.
The great demand throughout the colony for
these pure Bitters shows they are superior to all
others and equalled by none.
Facts Speak Louder than Words.
Read this sworn testimony from a well-known
citizen:—
Statutory Declaration.
“I, George Hewett, do hereby solemnly and
sincerely declare as follows :
I hat I feel it a duty I owe to the public to
state that I have been suffering for many years
from weakness of the stomach, so called INDI-
GESTION or DYSPEPSIA, and have been cured
by my taking two or three glasses of ROW’S
STEANE’S BITTERS a day in a little water, and
I hope others suffering from the same complaint
will be as speedily cured.
“(Signed) G. HEWETT,
“ 215 Pitt-street.
Row’s You’ll Do Bitters.
All who suffer from Chest Complaints, Cold, Coughs
and general weakness of the Lungs, will gain more ease
and comfort from a wineglass of ROW’S YOU'LL DO
BITTERS than any cough medicine tried before.
Row’s Pepsine Bitters.
All who suffer from Weak Digestion will soon
be cured by these Bitters, taken three times a day
before meals.
Row’s Oriental Bitters.
A Splendid General Tonic, with a tumbler of
water makes a drink equal to any best Champagne.
Row’s Steane’s Wine
Is a safe and sure stimulant for the female sex or
children, for it raises and strengthens depressed
systems without producing a temporary excite-
ment to be followed by greater depression.
Persons suffering from loss of appetite and
eneral depression of spirits cannot do better than
take
ROW’S STEANE’P WINE.
It cannot harm you, but must do good to all
delicate persons. Young Ladies can take this
when suffering from general debility. It’s only a
pure tonic. Try it.
1 eetotallers will find this newly-in vented
TONIC answer all the purposes of a stimulant
without its intoxicating quality. It will satisfy
the cravings of nature and create a desire for food
instead of drink. As an anti-febrile is unsur-
passed.
CAUTION.—When you call for these ask for
ROW’S, and take no substitute.
EDWARD ROW &, CO.,
Sv dLney.
Barney Bamato’s real name is Isaacs, and
he is the son of a Whitechapel old-clo’ dealer. He
and brother Harry were trained as pugs., and
were reckoned clever with their fists. Barney is
also a brilliant billiardist. “ Mrs.” Barney Bar-
nato was known in South Africa as Fanny Bees.
She is the handsome daughter of an Africander
resident at Simon’s Bay, where, before she met
-tsarney, she used to keep a coffee-stall.
Two females who have run a finished
swindle for some years past, were bowled out
lately in a Maoriland town. One of them—an
exceedingly pretty girl of 25 or so—used to get a
billet as governess or companion, and her modesty,
culture and Christian frame of mind would endear
her to everybody. Then, in a few weeks, she
would be taken seriously ill and go to the hospital,
where, by a judicious arrangement of symptoms,
it appeared that she was an incurable case of
kidney disease. She would, acknowledge re-
luctantly that she had been discharged as incur-
able from other hospitals, but she had concealed
her state from her late employer because (here
she gave way to tears) she might not
otherwise have been engaged, and she wanted
to earn her own living to the last. Also,
she would add that the Lord would provide.
This beautiful state of soul always made her a
favorite with fashionable visitors, and she would
receive more presents than all the rest of the hos-
pital put together. Then one day a humble but
stdl pretty widow would come to the hospital on
some errand of mercy, and be so impressed with
the touching patient that she announced her in-
tention of adopting her, and sharing her modest
crust with her, and soothing her last hours generally.
Beautiful girl adopted accordingly and removed in
tears and a. cab by her benefactress, who would be
last seen kissing her because she was so like her
dear lost daughter. All the benevolent ladies who
haunted the hospital would call on the pious pair
with donations for the bedridden Christian. Also,
the parsons and others would be roused to sympa-
thy and cash. When the cash and the sympathy
were used up the sufferer would go away to die
beautifully to soft music, and start the business all
over again elsewhere. The scheme worked well
for a time, but at last it broke down through
the recklessness of the invalid. Her adopted
parent had gone out in her widow’s-weeds
to look for work, shedding the tear of a
lonesome but resigned female as she went. A
little later the kindly landlady went up to say a
few pleasant words to the dying sufferer, and found
her trying a new corset on before the glass and
doing a riotous high-kick with her golden hair all
hanging down her back. The remainder of the
proceedings consisted mostly of dashes and
hyphens and hysterics and parentheses, and the
invalid fled that night and hasn’t been heard of
since. A beautiful but resigned female with a
hopeless disease should begin to strike the Austra-
lian country hospitals shortly.
A gritty Queenslander lately made his
S fl ov e rlan d from Gympie to the Westralian
gold-fields with a team of bullocks. The feats
performed in this journey might put many a
hugely-advertised explorer to the blush. On one
occasion a horse strayed away, and was followed
and brought back 150 miles (in all) through desert
country by the Queenslander’s son, a mere
stripling after nine days. After crossing the
nffin' ini "umber of bullocks died, but the
officials of that Saharan province collected the
r! 6 dead bovines Just the same.
iNaturally, the Queenslander has some very decided
opinions on mterprovincial tariffs.
Nervous sufferers will find it worth their
while to peruse Herr Rassmussen’s advt. on page

at the Society’s Head Office, comer of Collins

bourne, on FRIDAY, the 31st day of
JANUARY, 1896, at 12 noon.
Your Directors have pleasure in presenting the
following Statement of New Business and Report
for the year ending 31st October, 1895 (being the
fourth year of the Fifth Quinquennium), together
with the Revenue Account and Balance-sheet,
duly audited.
During the period embraced therein there have
been dealt with—
-254.2 Proposals amount-
in* to £644,107
Resulting as follows :

W ° suririg ... £405 317

299 Proposals in course of
completion, for... 79,904
rhe Amount pro-
posed reduced by 8,245

These figures compare favorably with those of
the preceding year, showing an increase of 316
in the number of Policies issued, and <£45,852
in the sums assured.

The Claims by Death are well within the amount
provided for by the Society’s tables, and your
Directors are pleased to be able once more to point
out that they are much more than provided for by
the Interest which has been realised upon the
Society’s Investments.
The"whole of the deeds and documents in con-
nection with the Society’s investments and loans
on mortgage have again been inspected indepen-
dently by the Auditors and the Solicitors in the
different colonies in which these securities are
held. The deeds and documents in connection
with all other classes of securities have been in-
spected by the Auditors. Copies of their certi-
ficates will be found attached to the subjoined
balance-sheet.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
Harry Musgrove’s management of the cricket
tour is likely to hurt the feelings of many English gate-
keepers, who have hitherto regarded the Australian
matches as joyous financial picnics. When H.M. comes
round enquiring into the takings and making multiplica-
tion sums which tot up 20 per cent, higher than the
“ returns,” he will astonish a lot of old cormorants at the
game. No previous manager has had anything like a
wide-awake notion as to how much money the “ house ”
i.e., the ground ought to be worth when crowded, or
where the leakages would be most likely to happen.
Musgrove is pretty certain to sniff some cash escapes.
Also, he will call himself in to stop them, as though he
were a plumber, and the check-takers will pass a hasty
resolution to the effect that Australian cricket has de-
generated somethink hawful.

Australian cricket hasn’t done much for its
G.O.M. Giffen. He gets £3 per week as a clerk in the
Adelaide Post-office, which is very bad business compared
with what he might have done as a professional cricketer
in England all these .years.
One of the applicants for managership of the
Australian team wanted £5OO, an equal share in the pro-
fits, and all expenses paid. Declined. Another applicant
would “ manaige the trip for half, the gross prophets atid
pay my own expences.” Also declined.
R. M‘Leod, the Melb. cricketer: “It is not the
amateur player that runs away with the money, hut the
professional manager. I think some of the managers
would find considerable trouble in accounting for sundries.
Thev walk about -as big as a house,- and - have a beautiful
time of it whilst we are out on the ground running our
legs off for the honor and glory of the lovely Vic. Assoc.
Do they consider whose money they spend when they
nominate four of themselves to attend the cricket council
in Sydney or Adelaide ? They vote £5O for themselves
and have a picnic. The council is the most useless body
ever formed.”

Published that in a match, Botnadery v. Tome-
rong (Canulen district), the former scored 8 runs in two
innings. One run only' was got off the bat: the rest were
sundries. One bowler got 14 wickets fori run. Tomerong
may have done it, but it looks like tommyrot.

“Thank God !” fervently exclaims H. Trott,
“Thank God ! the next won t be a team of wives.”

When the rain last Saturday stopped the play
some of the Vies, read the papers to pass the time. Some-
body found a bit of Latin and wanted a translation.
Bruce, the team’s classic, undertook it. Said A. E. Trott:
“ Isn’t the Latin language dead?” “ Yes,” said Bruce.
“ Well, let it rest in peace; let’s have a game of cards.”

In a club-match, the other day, the Adelaides
could onlv make 35 runs, on a good wicket, against S.
Adelaide, Jones getting six wickets for 17, and clean
bowling Giffen, Darling and Scrymgour. “ Jonah ” also
made 4tf, top score tor his side.

Dear Bulletin, —Are Zimmerman’s “ last words
in Australia” worth quoting? Because the young man
can sprint his nubbly legs taster than other cyclists, does
it follow that he is a good judge of their relative “ form,”
any more than a good trainer or jockey is necessarily a
wise tipster ? Zim. isn’t a little bit clever, as far as I can
make out. His bike-manufacturing business threatens to
swallow up all his money. When he ran his own show in
Melb. he managed to spoil his game by getting beaten
twice in one evening. vVhat’s the value of his opinion
that Parsons is as good as Harris, and which Harris does
he refer to, any way ? The one in condition who put up
the mile record in England, or the one out of condition
who has performed erratically in Australia? I make out
that Harris is quite as neat a rider as Parsons, and half as
strong again. In the matter of common sense, Martin,
the strongest of the three, beats them both. —F.
The defeat of Harris by Mystery recalls the
Melb. match between Woods, the English champion
cyclist, and five trotters, turned on one at a time at the
end ot each mile. Woods was ingloriously beaten both in
this and in a similar match at Christchurch, M.L., some
months later, but his performance on a hard-tyred ordi-
nary over five miles ranks far superior to that of the
Leicester lad last week. Harris's defeat is inexplicable ;
the day was perfect and the track not so lumpy as to ac-
count for the absence ot any sprint at the nnish. The
writer would like to see Mystery and any racing cyclist
around Mein, have a go on st. Kilda road.
* * » »
The moral of the Mystery v. Harris match is
that a “ onampion ’ cycl.st deserves to be beaten by a
horse. The Englishman rode without an ounce of brains.
He was supposed to be capable of getting over a mile in
less time tnari the trotting-mare comd record. Also, he
was cocksure that he could beat her in a short sprint.
Tnen all he had to do was to take the lead at the start,
thereby forcing the trotter to come along and get in front
of him, and so make a pace, or otherwise ensuring his
own victory by staying in front until it was time to ueat
the animal for speed in a sprint home. Instead of which
he hung behind the sulky for seven furlongs in both
heats, failed to come to tiie front at the finish, and leit
the course with the plaintive cry that he could have won
easily if the}’ had allowed him a tandem to take him
along. It's time that a buck nigger, or a Chow, became
cycling champion of the Universe.
« * * *
The match was farcical and uninteresting.
Harris took a feeler in the first heat, which Mystery
landed in 2.20 l-sth a 0 to 4 odds on chance. The
“clever” division fell- in when it laid a to 1 on Hams
in the concluding heat (as it proved . Butt, who drove
the mare, wouldn’t pace-make until the last 2ufyds, when
he left the surprised Harris standing. It was simply a
200yds. spin.
Owner Rob6rtson didn’t cotton to Harris’s pro-
posal tor a mile match for £5O a-side, Mystery to nave
50yds. start and the cyclist to be tandem-paced. It’s the
old yarn. A cyclist can’t race unless someone is riding in
front or a bull is forcing the pace from the rear.

“There is no doubt that the greatest pastime
of the day is cycling. This has made such rapid strides
in the past two years that the manufacturers find it hard
to cope with the large demand for wheels. As a con se-
quence, in the United States alone no less than a hundred
new factories,” &c., &c. Melb. Anars commissioned
“ Champion ” Zimmerman—poor wretch ! to write a
spec al article on cycling as an art or a business, or any-
thing worth talk aad_ this drivel was the result.
Apparently Zim. lacked even the brain-power to think of
getting a “ghost ” to write up the subject for him.

Harris, Martin, Porta, and Pither have formed
themselves into a syndicate to exploit Maoriland. I’ar-

Zimmerman’s advice to Parsons: “Bide a
low gear; 1 never go above 68 fir 7tl; and flash, don t
plug.” Parsons comes to the Sydney carnival in March.
Zimmerman in the Arous : “In London and
Paris thousands of iniatuated wheelers plunge madly
about the streets from dark until two or three o clock in
the morning.” A blood-curdling addition to the horrors
of the cities of Dreadful Night.
♦ * * *
F.: Three bike columns in Bulletin 832. "W hen

Immediately after Zimmerman lost his races in
Melbourne, he exclaimed : “Twice licked : Waal, 1 must
find an excuse for this lot.” Comedian Coleman was by
and, pointing up to where Mrs. Z. sat, said : “There you
are, A-arthur, there's your excuse.”
Ziin. will never return to Australia, say those
who ought to know best. “I am too fond ot the game to
give up racing altogether,” said Zimmerman, “ but my
plan in the future will be to stick down hard to business.

The way Porta won the mile Intercolonial
Scratch Race shows that the Italian long-distance wheeler
is beginning to spurt. The race was a crawl for three laps,
and when the racing did start Parsons, Martin, and Lewis
had to finish behind the Italian.

Martin’s disqualification, after beating Lewis by
three-quarters of a lap in the Live Miles Track Champion-
ship, at A.N.A. meeting, was the hardest of luck, and the
surprise is that Lewis should have lodged a protest.
Seemingly Martin could have had a nap on the track and
then beaten Lewis.

Stanbury, on easy work at Ryde, has reduced
to 13st. 71b. He has yet to bring off another stone to

At Mary vale Station, Upper Burnekin, two
spotted deer were turned 1 >ose some years ago by Mr.
Hann, a well-known North Queenslander. They have
vastly increased in numbers, and live mostly in the tea-

and fleet of foot, and cannot be approached—either or»
foot or on horseback.

The paucity of first-class horses in Australia—
animals capable of carrying weight and getting over a
long journey in good time—has of late evoked consider-
able comment. Though the fact is obvious, little thought
is given the subject until big handicaps come round. Take
the principal cash-spending event of the year. Three-
quarters ot the entrants are sifted out by the talent as
rubbish ; a reservation is made as to three-year-oids ; the
top-weights may be regarded as overburdened ; which
leaves the middle division, most of whom are selected as
havi -chances—if they can stay. Then Australia, young
and old, spends months studying “ form ” books, figuring
out if they can stay, or are likely to stay, though sup-
posed to be unable to. The average backer calculates
thuswise, unless he has a special fancy for one of the
leading division who can stay, or has been put on to a
nonentity, which eventually turns out to have as much

Mr. A. L. Baird writes that at the carnival held
at Sydney Natatorium the will-registering machine
could not be properly w'orked on account of the great
crush around it constantly interfering. The heats, too,

that under proper conditions the machine is ail that it is

Trotting, in Sydney, is as dead as Julius C’fesar’s
step-brother. Never under proper control, or given a
decent show all to itself, there’s no cause for wonder.
The clubs that gave trotting events a place on their pro-
grammes discontinued them on the alleged grounds of
audacious swindling and unutterable rascality generally
which is regrettable from a sporting and general stand-
point. But if they were worse than some ot the pony
“ races ” they must have been very, very bad.
In M.L. wealthy trotting-elubs flourish in every
part ol the country. They own well-appointed tracks,
give rich stakes, and provide good sport. Men ot stand-
ing, breeders ol horses and others, patronise and control
the sport. This, combined with the tote, is responsible
tor the elevation ot trotting above the level of magsmen s
races. The machine is the only legitimate betting agency
that conduces to the advancement and encouragement of
honest, sport,. It doesn't own horses, or nobble those who
do own them. Nor does it whisper to the jockey as he s
going out. L'ntd its arrival, trotting will continue to be
dead and festering in Sydney.
The marked improvement in the breed of the
trotter in M.L. during the last few years is a matter of
note. The importation of strains from America and else-
where has effected great alteration, and breeders find a
good market there. Mr. Sam Hordern yearly, sends a
batch across for auction, and has endowed two events of
the Auckland Trotting Club with good stakes for com-
petition among aniitials of his own raising.

The Argus berates Turner and Co. for
yielding to the opinions of Parliament instead of
fighting tooth-and-claw for a hard-and-fast pro-
gramme. “ The old practice, ” snorts the Argus,
“ is for a Ministry to have a policy, and to tight
that policy for all it is worth.” The Argus prin-
ciple in politics is “win, tie, or wrangle;” any
kind of Conservative confusion being preferable to
Democratic progress, however limping.
Sydney Telegraph, in its commercial
column, January 23 :
The question is whether Mr. Reid can, from a revenue
standpoint, surrender the sugar-duties. If he can, with-
out imposing more burdensome direct taxation he should,
&c\, &c.
If he can ! Think of the Telegraph beginning
to totter in its faith like this, and to wonder if the
protective sugar-duty should be removed after all,
and if the direct taxation it has howled for may
not be “ more burdensome “ in this case than the
unclean thing it has howled against with so dire-
ful a howl!!!
Poor Battenberg’s bad luck stuck to him
to the last. He was the son of a small German
prince by his morganatic marriage with a high-
kick wtress, and the potentates of Europe wouldn’t
recogi. se him. Then he was a Prussian officer of
a low j,rade, and had an income of JffiO a year all
told, and legend asserts that he had to clean his
own boots. He married a British princess,
Victoria’s favorite daughter, who threatened to
develope into an old maid, and, having no means
of his own. he lived on his mother-in-law. The
whole royal family kept him in order, and made
him sit consistently on the hard chair next the
door, and he was put into kilts and other
humiliations. Then his wife became lf>-stone or
thereabouts, and took to riding a bicycle. And,
finally, this fine figure of a man grew weary of it
all, and went away to earn some laurels and seek
peace in the prospective Ashantee war, and he
caugh.t the first fever which came along and died
without once getting -into action. Poor Batten-
berg ! The so-called French Prince Imperial
poked his nose into the Zulu shambles, and stayed
there. Fighting Burnaby “waggedit” into the
Soudan troubles, and a common Arab spear was
Fate’s reproof. Moral: Lay to your book.

The women are said to have shown the
men an example of coolness and courage on the
occasion of the fire on the Cintra :
The dames stand on the burning deck
Whence all the men have fled,
And do not seem to care a speck

Their confidence is in the rule
“No smoking aft this rail.”
Re the Cintra fire, it is most wonderful
that more fires don’t break out in the steerage
quarters of the Western steamers. Most of the
W.A. boats have reserved a slice out of their
cargo-holds, fitted up four tiers of bunks three or
four abreast, and called the result a “steerage.”
There are no portholes, and the only air entering
the apartment is drawn from the open hatch
(closed in rough weather). As this is also the only
source of light, the gloom of the rear bunks may
be imagined. All day and night candles and
lanterns in these quarters'consume nine-tenths of
the air which enters, and, after one steerage trip
West, the average man would prefer to sleep in
the engine-room or the stoke-hole.

An £asy Interview.
The way of the interviewer—like that of the
transgressor—is oftentimes hard, but this was not
the experience of the writer who interviewed Mr.
John Lawton, of Brunswick Cottage, Brunswick
Street, Brisbane, Queensland. In fact, Mr.
Lawton seemed willing, even eager, to relate his
experience, which we give below m his own words :
“Having suffered severely from rheumatism in
my legs and feet for many years, being at times
for a month together a complete cripple, and un-
able to put my boots Cn or walk about the floor,
and also having tried Allopathy, Homoeopathy,
Hydropathy, and goodness knows what other
‘ pathy, ’ I was induced by a friend to try Warner’s
‘ Safe ’ Remedies, and I must say I was very
sceptical about it at first. In fact I had begun to
think I was doomed to continual suffering for the
rest of my life. However, as ‘ perseverance re-
moves mountains,’ so Warner’s Safe Rheumatic
Cure removed my mountain of misery, and here I
am now perfectly free from it, having had for the
last five years nothing beyond a gentle reminder,
on receipt of which I immediately fly to my ‘ Safe ’
and obtain almost instant relief. This being so, I
feel it my duty, as well as a great pleasure, to
give this entirely unsolicited testimonial in the
hopes that by doing so I may be instrumental in
assisting some other sufferer.” *

lous. Over and over attain we see a horse, a certainty for
the race m which he is entered, “ stiffened ” in lavor of
some second-rater which, more often than not, is beaten,
lfie stilt is kept tor some big* event, backed heavily, and
runs second or third. Then the uisgusted owner puts him
up tor eteile, and gets about a third of his proper price tor
nim. the purchaser, preferring an even-money certainty
to a long-priced chance, enters him for some small race,
and the horse romps home. That’s the difference between
cunning and common-sense.
As a' rule pony-punters, unless well-informed,
deter backing until the pomes come out for their prelim-
inary gallops ; they then enquire of the jockeys, “ What
do you like, Micky 7 " “What's your fancy, Billy V”
When Micky, riding Doormat, tells his pals to back Boot-
scraper, everybody knows that Doornmt is “ dead ” (un-
less Micky is doing a “ double cross ”), but the stewards
never seem to notice it, and the iai ce of racing is kept up.
I lie proprietors of the pony courses are greatly
exercised in their minds at the latest development of
bookmaking. At nearly every course around .Sydney a
number of “ books congregate outside on some eminence
and bet “ thripinnies ’ and “ sprats” and “ deeners ” with
people who can t a.lord to pay admission-fee. One reason
way this class of “ bookies ” gets so many patrons is their
comparative ignorance of the merits of the horses en-
gaged., A jockey-boy in the paddock knows a “good
tiling ; he can t get better than even money in the pad-
docK or Leger, so he goes to the “ books ’’ outside, and,
finding that they know nothing about the aforementioned
• good thing,” puts a few shillings on with each of them
at five or six to one, and makes a naul.
At one or two of the little courses the trot still
flourishes, and is invariably the most amusing item on the
programme. Seldom, indeed, is there more than one
“ trier, hut the antics of the others are instructive.
Sometimes the “dead” trotter finds himseif dangerously
near winning, much to the alarm of owner and jock.
Thereiore the latter makes his mount break into a canter,
when, according to the rules, he must pull up and start
again, this proceeding loses him a lot of ground and
may be repeated when necessary.
C. D. O’Halloran’s libel-writ against H. H.
Champion takes special exception to two points. Cham-
pion said O'M. was “carpeted”; O Halioran says he
volunteered his statement to the stewarus. Champion
will probably plead against this that it was announced in
the Mkrauu on. the day of the race that the owner of
Dowry was oa.L-d before the stewards, and that O H. did
not contradict it. The other point is the comparison
wuh the Bowden v. Anderson ease, which is alleged to be
“ a scurrilous libel.”

muchness. Honda, the unluckiest of his day, might have
been let in with a stone less. Even tiien he d perhaps
ouly get second, break Ins neck or something.
Kirkby, full brother to Portsea, is another Cup
beauty ; so is the aged Taurus, while btrahan is a gem.
Alter a trial the latter was backed for Caulueld Cup two
years ago at odds ot lihl to a cigar, and, of course, he lost
the cigar. He d break a pawusnop, would btrahan.
The peculiarly constituted Chesterman is gener-
ally conceded to nave a second to none chance in the Cup,
staying being his iorte. He ran the race or his life in the
Hanuvviek Plate, when he cut the time down, but it was
through the instrumentality of lame Light Artillery, who
showed the way hi the first zk nines.

The handieapper has plainly shown how the next

would put his boots on Oxenhams colt. T'ive pounds
makes a big diff. in a long race, and there’s not that
between the pair. Fort, too, is not regarded as anything
near first chop tor the classic event when Wallace con-
cedes him i'Jlu. in the Cup.

SKIN DISEASE
CURED BY
Ayer’s Sarsaparilla
Mr. Geo. W. Burtner, Keezletown, Va.,
writes, as follows !
“ shortly after leaving college, I was troubled
with a skin disease which showed itself, first, at
the ankles. Physicians pronounced it eczema,
and treated me for that complaint. The erup-
tion crept slowly up my limbs, and on the body,
until it enveloped the whole frame. It gave me
infinite trouble with constant itching, casting off
of dry scales, and a watery liquid which would
exude from under the scales. I treated it for
over three years unsuccessfully, and was unable
to check it, until I began using Ayer’s SaTsapa-
rilla. I used three bottles of this medicine and
was completely cured —my skin becoming as
smooth and clear as before.’’

The very oldest inhabitant of Port Fairy
district went into Belfast (Vic.) during the recent
holidays to see a locomotive for the first time.
His son, aged 50, went with him for the same pur-
pose. The oldest inhabitant —the person with
one reliable tooth who gibbers about turnips by
the fireside—is always breaking out like this.
His chief distinction, in most cases, is the number
of things he hasn’t seen, and the enormous length
of time during which he has never removed from
his own district, and when one meets him he
inspires a problem that is akin to a nightmare—
what would a district exclusively peopled by oldest
inhabitants be like ? Such districts can be found
in England—or they could 30 years ago. The
present writer remembers one. It was an agricul-
tural hamlet, and every soul in it had been bom
and lived his whole life within three miles—
except old George Smith. George Smith
was an irreproachable person aged 60, who
earned 12s. a week by gardening. He went to
the Baptist chapel and the prayer-meeting
regularly, and every Saturday evening he scrupu-
lously polished his boots and read the Christian
World—he never read anything else except the
Bible, and he never drank or smoked, and hadn’t
been in a theatre or a cab or a train all his life,
and he had a plain, irreproachable daughter named
Sarah. But in his youth he had removed—by
road—from exactly such another village 15 miles
away, and he never quite got over it. People
viewed old George Smith as a person of a roving
disposition who was liable to break out at any
moment and be an extensive traveller, or an ex-
plorer, or even go to Wolverhampton and attend
the Baptist Conference. They felt there was a
want of stability and deep-rootedness about him,
and old, sound, agricultural persons didn’t like
their sons to call round and borrow Smith’s
Christian World for fear they should become
unsettled in their minds—which was quite need-
less, for they hadn’t any. Finally, Smith did
break out, for he shifted into another cottage a
quarter of a mile down the road, and there he died
from rheumatiz, his wages having been reduced to
10s. a week in his 64th year.

lo Hekr Rassmussen,
Proprietor of the Alfaline Remedies.
Dear Sir, —It gives me great pleasure to inform
you that I have derived great benefit from your
celebrated Alfaline Remedies during my explor-
ing expeditions throughout Australia, and I con-
sider them invaluable to all travellers in the bush.
—Yours very truly, B. BUTTON,
(Formerly a Councillor, Brighton, England).

Mr. Button writes later:—“The Pills I had
from you were of great benefit to me and others.
In one case, when three hunters and trappers
were travelling about the ranges near my place on
the Rose River, one was taken very ill ; his mates
intended taking him in a waggon to Wangaratta
(about 60 miles) next morning to see a doctor. I
gave him a few of your Pills. lam pleased to
inform you that having to pass their camp next
day, I found him up and pegging-out his skins
and looking well. This speaks volumes for your
valuable Remedies.”

It gives me great pleasure indeed to inform

know how to thank you enough. Dear Sir, I

I am pleased to inform you that your Alfaline
Rock Cure Rills completely cured me of a very
bad disease. Previous to taking your Lock Pills,
1 was under the treatment of a doctor for six
weeks, but was getting no better; and I shall
never regret trying your Alfaline Pills, as they
bad a wonderful effect on my complaint, which
several of my work-mates can testify to. I have
recommended your Alfaline Herbal Remedies to
several of my friends, who have reason to be very
grateful for it, and I shall always do my best to
recommend them to any fellow sufferers. You

A Wonderful Cure.
Herr Rassmussen. August, 1894.
Dear Sir, In the year of 1871 I was eight days
in the water sheep-washing, and contracted rheu-
matism and stiffness in the joints, and have tried
al ad vertised medicines. When I came to Sydney
*, lla “ a d'fficulty in walking, and went to
the lurkish baths, which did no good. Passing
v£ U *U Wlndow 1 Baw a testimonial from Mr. E.
tI O Sull, . van . M.P., with the same complaint as
1 had, which led me to try your Remedies. On
Ihursday before Good Friday I took the first of
your Pills; since then I have used 4 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Vitality Pills, 3 boxes Special
Powerful Alfaline Rheumatic Pills, with Liver
and Kidney Pills, and free use of your Alfaline
Eucalyptus Oil, and I am now, with the blessing
of God, as well in health as I was 23 years ago.
I can with great confidence recommend your
Remedies to anyone suffering from the same com-

be a blessing to suffering humanity.
I remain, dear sir, yours very gratefully,

A Lady Cured of General Debility.
Herr Rassmussen. March 15th, 1894.
Sir,—l hereby beg to certify that having been
a sufferer from General Debility of the Nervous
System for over seven years, and having tried
without success several of the leading doctors
both in Sydney and Melbourne, I was advised to
try your Alfaline Remedies. lam thankful I did
so, for after a few courses of the Alfaline Remedies
I am now completely cured, and I shall be most
happy to recommend your remedies to anyone
suffering as I was. Thanking you for your
courtesy and the uniform patience with which
you have treated me, allow me to say that you
can make what use you may think proper of this.
Wishing you every success, allow me to remain,

HEAT-DRINK.
When the heat-wave overwhelms the land;
when the sun devours the day and the moon
mocks the burning night; when the bleating
of sheep, the carol of birds and the insects’
hum are stilled in the hush of deatli ; when
the leaves struck dead by the sun’s fierceness
make their graves around the doomed troes ;
when pastures are deserts; lagoons and
billabongs Golgothas of bones and festering
carcases ; when the swamp grasses are dust
and the river reeds ashes ; when men whose
brothers are dead see the heat-rent
earjdi yawning graves on every side ;
when the carrion crow flies from the
scene of nature’s crimes southward on the
wings of fear ; then, and not till then, does
general humanity form a conception of the
agonies of thirst.
& * * * *
And everyone is thirsty ; thirsts with a
great thirst. The pop of alcoholic corks is
mixed with the fizzing of teetotal wash and
the thud of the heat-stroke corpse. And,
say many leading Sydney doctors, with the
more frequentthud of the drink corpse. Heat
kills a few ; thirst, several ; drink, many.
Sydney Sunday Times, having suffered like
the rest, sent out its special to several
eminent medicos to get a prescription for a
parched throat. Sydney Daily Telegraph
also interviewed the big men of small cures
and large bills. * *
The medical testimony which is condemna-
tion may be summarised thus. Intoxicating
beverages are bad—very bad ; non-intoxi-
cating are also bad—also very bad. Here
are the points of detail.
BEERS, WINES AND SPIRITS
produce the bladder and kidney complaints
so prevalent in Austraha. They also de-
velop the unwieldy and wrong-thinking
belly, the red, inhuma u snout ; the apathetic
brain. Says Bismarjk : “ Beer makes men
stupid, lazy, impotent.”
MILK !
Menacing drink ! Fraught with probable
dreadful disease ! Sydney’s every week sees
some distributor of milk brought up at the
police court and fined for selling impure or
adulterated milk. Were the dairyman always
the cause he should always be hung. But he
is nearly always not to blame. It is the
milk ! the milk ! The real criminal is the
cow. Look not upon the milk when it is
white lest you issue direct challenge to tuber-
culosis and slow, agonising death. Tempt
not Providence, for Providence, though
omniscient and omnipotent, is, on evidence,
not beyond temptation.
LEMON SQUASH !
The name suggests the man consumed with
bellyache, with dysentery, with death.
Besides, the human race is sour enough
already.
SODA !
Who hath shaky legs 1 Who hath bended
knees ? Who hath the spine of the jelly-
fish T He that dallies long with soda and
the enfeeblement thereof.
• * • *
TEA !
Alas ! it is the cup enclosed by the serpent
of scandal. Tea is indigestion, which is the
devil, which is the tomb, which is the devil
again and for ever.
* * • •
COFFEE!
Ends in coffee poisoning which injures brain,
nerve and stomach worse than alcohol. A
man hasn’t time to get D.T.’s from coffee —
it flattens him out too soon.
• * . • •
iERATED WATERS AND TEMPER-
ANCE TIPPLE !
Contain the curse alcohol ; often contain as
many bacteria as ordinary water.
FRUIT-FLAVOURED essences
As a rule are rank alcoholic poison.
* * * *
WATER !
God preserve the idiot who has water on the
brain. Water ! hydatids ! bacteria ! fluke !
microbes ! dysentery ! typhoid ! thirst!
death !
• * * *
ICE !
Lets all these circumstances into the human
craw, with the additional ill that they are
frozen. Ice has made America synonymous
with chronic dyspepsia.
* * * •
FILTERS !
With one or two rare exceptions, are breed-
ing - grounds for microbes, seed - beds of
disease. Not long ago, iir India, a very fatal
epidemic was only cheeked by the abolition
of filters.
* * * *
Thus do the doctors take away from us in-
toxicants and non-intoxicants ; beer, wines,
spirits ; serated waters, milk, tea, coffee, ice,
water, soda, &c. What shall we drink I
Hire’s Root Beer ! It fulfils the conditions
pointed out by the doctors ; The water in
it has hern filtered scientifically, and sterilised ;
the other ingredients are roots, bark, herbs,
scientifically prepared.
* * ,* »
If the Sydney doctors recently emphasised
anything, they emphasised the value of
sterilisation. But, in addition to having the
negative virtues that the doctors asked for,
it has the positive virtues of being strength-
ening, gently stimulating, sparkling, effer-
vescing and appetising. It was introduced
from America to Australia some 12 months
ago. In America, it is no uncommon thing
for a railway trait' of 30 cars to travel from
Philadelphia to San Francisco with nothing
but Hire’s Tmot Beer. The Australian
agents are Shirley Clayton & Co., of Pitt-
street, Sydney. 1000 cases, representing |
ot a million of gallons are now on the way
from America, and millions more are to
follow. Thus is the great question of thirst
solved for ever.
The Read just meat of the Ecliptic.
Dear Bulletin’,— Let us put all the special-
prayer weather-workers out of their agony. Some
want to supplicate the Almighty to moderate the
furnaces of the sun, and to turn off the “ heat-
wave.” Others are frightened because of infeli-
citous experiences after the recent Brunker-
Saumarez-Bavin prayers for rain—some fellows
having had their crops swamped ; others being
still in drought. Now, I have a plan to cure all
these inequalities mundane, and to fix things up
evenly and everlastingly. I have long been per-
fect ing an invention, unparalleled in human his-
toiy, but resting on simple natural laws. Only I
need Capital, and I give The Bulletin the chance
to scoop that capita] in for the benefit of the
afflicted earth. Here’s the
PROSPECTUS OF THE SEASON CURING CO., LTD.
Capital: £2,000,000 in £1 shares prepaid.
To purchase from the Proprietors, Dipso, Dom & Co.,
Professors of Natural Physics, Metaphysics, Psychics, and
Omniologies,
The whole of their Right, Title and Interest in their
Invention for the Readjustment of the Ecliptic, whereby
the Earth’s Axis shall he made Perpendicular to the Plane
of the Earth’s Orbit; whereby—
1. There shall be equal day and equal night all over the
Earth all the Year round.
2. There shall be one permanent, equal, benevolent
season all the year round.
The advantages of this enterprise are obvious.
All men will then be able to sow or plant or
harvest just when they darn well please.
Special advantages to squatters: You can postpone
Lambing until you’re ready for it.
Attractions for the Eight-Hour Party : You will have
12 hours day and 12 hours night all the year round, and
can arrange your fixtures with greater than present con-
venience.
Notice to Tee-Companies: There will be no more
natural ice except at very high altitudes, and the Arti- :
ficial Ice-Companies must boom. Now’s the time to rush |
these shares.
Sub-Prospectus of tiie Season Bossing Co., Ltd.
Capital : £10,000,000, in £1 shares prepaid.
To buy out the whole Right, Title and Interest of the
above-named Co. when floated—that is to say, “ The
Season Curing Co., Ltd.”
And to further buy from Dipso, Dom and Co., pro-
fessors of N.P., M., P., and Omniologies,
Their further magnificent Invention for the Control-at- !
Will of the Obliquity of the Earth’s Axis, and the Regula-
tion-at-Choice of the Ecliptic ; whereby—
1. The Owners of this Machine shall boss the Earth
how and when they please.
2. The Heat or Cold, Drought or Rain, Dew or Frost,
shall be dispensed at pleasure, and at rates determined j
by the Proprietors Only.
So soon as the sum of £10,000,000 has been sub-
scribed, no outsiders shall have any show. Therefore,
shares had better be rushed for at once by all
those who want to boss Nature and all Nature’s forces.
N.B. : The Law of Gravitation can be suspended at special
rates.

THE DIPSOMANLAC.
Maoriland Anti-gambling League wants to
put down betting in all forms because it leads to
“improvidence, extravagance, living beyond one’s
means, and a general disregard of thrift and
prudence.” And the very first item on the
League’s balance - sheet reads —“ Overdraft at
bank, .£187.”
A song that knocks “patriotic” Austra-
lians in Melbourne describes how brave and
noble Jameson with his band of heroes went
forth to fight the Boers, which proves “ that
Britons will be conquerors ever,” and “British
subjects never will be slaves.” The fact that
Jameson and his heroes were complacently mopped
up by the vulgar Boer is ingenuously disregarded,
and the fatuous audience uproariously encores the
shrill and breathless singer.
Melb. women cyclists are now almost all
clad in full dress—“ Guvment ’Ouse” having
frowned on bloomers. All the same, there is
amongst the wheelwomen a decided hankering
after breeches, and it is rumoured that the majority
wear them in their evening spins, with a thin skirt
above at starting. When away from town the
skirt is discarded. Some bloomered Melb. Uni-
versity girls have been riding astride through the
backblocks of Gippsland. They were generally
taken for portions of a stray circus.
The cable states that “ the German
Emperor, addressing the leading statesmen and
officers of the army, waved the German standard
and swore to defend the empire.” This kind of
pomp and frill grows rather tiring. Why
should the military department of the State
always conduct itself in this childish fashion and
go waving things, when the other branches can
get on without it? The Treasurer doesn’t wave a
big banner now and then and swear to keep ac-
counts straight, and the Fite Gibbon office doesn’t
flourish a garish standard and cheer and put on a
rainbow uniform, and take a great oath in public
that it will see that large beasts don’t get into the
water-supply. Have the military no sense of
humor that they play the goat in this fashion ?
Swallow and Ariell, of Melb., have just
introduced a new line of fancy biscuits, in boxes
decorated with pictures of girls so charming that
people who buy the biscuits will have the greatest
difficulty in refraining from devouring the box.
This firm’s tinned plum puddings, desiccated
soups, compressed vegetables, and canned fruits,
not to mention their cakes, biscuits, and preserves,
are famous all over Australia ; and in the wildest
recesses of this great continent the man who
fancies himself an explorer will find a beer-bottle
and a Swallow and Ariell tin. Such vogue can
only be due to one thing—Al quality.*
The portentous progress of Smith is the
most mournful thing about John Sands’ Sydney
Directory for 1896. Smith welters over nine
closely-printed columns of Directory, and his off-
shoots, Smyth, and Smythe, and Smithers, and

Smish, who appears this year for the first time,
but whose device is so original and impressive that
it is bound to be widely initated. So far as Sydney
is concerned, most of Smith are named John, and
the remainder of him are chiefly labelled George.

out of every four little Smiths who reach this

Dear Bulletin, — Re black - trackers : I
was in Coonamble Courthouse, some years ago,
when there was a cattle-stealing case on big
enough to have brought barrister David Buchanan
from Sydney. A lame, full - blooded darkey
described how he tracked the stolen (fat) bullocks,
and the horses of those who drove them from the
creek, where they were joined by a lot of working
bullocks ; after travelling together a further dis-
tance the working bullocks separated and went
down the creek, while the fat ones took another
direction, and he described their subsequent pro-
ceedings till they (or a portion of them) were
found by him and the police. Buchanan saw his
chance, and, when his turn for cross-examination
came, led off with some harmless preliminary
questions ; then, suddenly changing his tone, he
thundered out, with a ferocity calculated to make
an aboriginal turn pale: “Now, you’re a very
clever black-tracker, and you’ve learned your story
well. Will you tell his Honor and the jury
how you knew the working bullocks went down
the creek and not the fat bullocks ? ” With a
look of pity for the ignorance of the town man,
the darkie explained : “You see, fat bullock, he
bin strong, walk smart, this way (imitating),
make it clean track. Workin’ bullock, he bin tired,
drag his foot, make it mark longa ground, this
way.” The tracker’s “hoppy ” walk heightened the
amusement caused by his pantomime and the dis-
comfiture of Buchanan, whose subsequent cross-
exam. was only a spiritless “ do-something-for-
your-fee ” business. His client “ fell in ” —even a
Coonamble jury of that day failing to raise a
reasonable doubt for the benefit of a fellow-worker
in the moonlighting industry. Another instance :
Two kangaroo-shooters, at Ulimambir Station,
reported to the Coonabarabran police that 200
scalps had been stolen from their camp. Unluckily
for the thieves, there was a private mark on
each scalp. ' Sergeant Ewing, with Peter
Murphy, a black-tracker, nosed about the
camp till the tracker got on the trail, and
reported that the thieves were two persons
on horseback, one leading a pack-horse with a
large pack on the near side, and that they
were travelling towards Coolah in the dark. They
tracked them close to Coolah, where their tracks
were crossed by a large mob of travelling sheep,
and obliterated. They found one of the horses,
however, dead-beat and abandoned (a stolen Ulim-
ambir horse). After long delay they again
picked up the tracks beyond where the sheep had
been and followed them to a house somewhere
beyond Cassilis, where they found the horses
hobbled out, and two men whom they arrested on
suspicion. Enquiry showed that some of the
scalps had been sold at Merriwa. They were
identified by the private marks, and the buyer re-
cognised the prisoners as those who sold them to
him. The men were convicted. The scalps had
been carried in two wheat-sacks, one on each side
of the horse. Peter Murphy explained in evi-
dence that he knew one was a led horse because
the tracks were always parallel. There was evi-
dently a large pack on the side, because the two
horses travelled wide apart and never came
together or jostled, the pack keeping them asunder.
It was dark, because sometimes they got off the
road, and more than once they ran into a wire-
fence where it was parallel with and near the
road. The blacks’ wonderful tracking feats are
due as much to close and subtle reasoning as to
keen, trained eyesight.—Bush Native.

IMPORTANT NOTICE TO CIGARETTE SMOKERS.
WE beg to inform our customers and cigarette smokers generally that the American Tobacco Co.,
Ltd., of N.S.W., who control the sale of cigarettes known under the brands of “ Allen and
Ginter’s Straight-out No. 1,” “Cameo ” and “ Old Judge,” and who manufacture the colonial-made
cigarettes called “Pure Gold ” and “ Dixon’s No. 1,” have given us official notice that they will not
supply us with any of their American-made cigarettes unless we agree to relinquish the agency held by
us for New South Wales for the world-renowned English firm of W. D. and H. O. WILLS, Limited,
the manufacturers of those popular high-class cigarettes known as
“THREE CASTLES” and “ CAPSTbA-HsT.”
We have declined to conform with this request, as we feel it would not be to the nterest of
cigarette smokers in New South Wales to allow the American Tobacco Co., Limited, to monopolise
the whole of the cigarette trade. We, therefore, appeal to cigarette smokers to try the celebrated
Wills’ “Three Castles” and “ Capstan” Cigarettes,
And compare their quality with that of any other. We are confident that their verdict will be in
favor of the
“Three Castles” and “Capstan” Cigarettes,
And by smoking these they will prevent any one Company from attempting to dictate what people
should or should not smoke.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The subjoined narration—in respectful
contravention of “ Banjo’s ” statements in last
Bulletin Xmas number that the sheep is not
ferocious and “ no one could ever say that a sheep
attacked him without provocation is a humble
offering upon the altars of natural history and
sacred truth.
* * » *
The British Army in India mollifies itself
with pets—apes, cheetahs, Bengal tigers, and
cognate foundlings. But there is no beast undtr
the sky that so completely fills the British soldier’s
aching void for unadulterated cussedness as a
ram. In heaven above, the earth beneath, the
water under the earth, or below that, there is
nothing more broilsome, nothing of a more demo-
niacal pugnacity than a fighting ram. On
“ J ndia ’ s coral strand ” Nizams, Nabobs, Mahara-
jahs, and Rajahs compete for the possession of
rams of attested extraordinary bellicose capacity.
* * * *
Several years ago, when H.M.’s 3rd
Dragoon Guards lay at Mhow (E. 1.), thev had
namcrfl^nv^ 11 !? 6 * a pecul j arl y profligate ram
i Was exceed ingly beloved, while
he lasted, because he was so wicked. He was the
means of disseminating unjust suspicions and of
shattering friendships. He nearly killed the
senior-major. Also, he was grossly unprincipled.
Did a provident dragoon place a pannikin of arak
convenient for night consumption, Billy drank it
and the innocent were blamed. Bellicose in his
most sober moments, Billy, after half-a-pint of
rum, would have unhesitatingly attacked a
hundred tons of mad elephant. Failing elephants,
he would, if not too drunk to find his way, sally
to the horse-lines, and there gratuitously and
brutally attack a certain splendid man-eating
stallion. This horse, the terror of the ghora-tvalas
and of the regiment, had killed at least three of
the former and eaten a good deal of them, and had
mangled several of the latter. He was picketed
alone, with special pegs and double head-and-heel
ropes. Even thus he could reach effectively with
his teeth to his second rib on either side, and to
either flank with his hind legs; he could do as
much devastation with his forelegs a,s a Nasmyth
hammer in full working order. But, always sup-
posing the ropes held, there was a space between
ribs and flank which he could not negotiate or
* Billy had studied out this fact, and, when
fighting drunk, would stagger down, take the
bearings of the defenceless spot, and then butt the
horse in the stomach until he (Billy) had no more
butt left in him. Then he would lie down, re-
cover his wind, and go swaggering and guffawing
back to barracks like the debauched old Silenus
he was. The entire, frightened of nothing else on
earth or elsewhere, was terrorised by Billy and
fairly shrieked whenever he approached. One night
the former, while punishment was proceeding, got
loose. The natives, gating from a safe place, pre-
dicted Billy’s demise in one lightning act. As a
matter of fact the man-eater bolted, yelling with
rage, pain and fear, while Billy sat down and
laughed till the tears ran down his face. So
knocked-about and scared was the stallion that he
was easily secured next morning in an adjacent
and hf \ ha J, with the exception of making
little mischief * Ben * ah baby or two > done
* * * *
Like many habitual drunkards, Billy was
immoderately addicted to tobacco, which he would
beg borrow, or steal-steal for choice. “ Tokey ”
Willmm and “Spud” Murphy “cut the loaf”
entirely owing to Billy’s malign influence. They
had occupied adjacent cots and had been sworn
comrades for years, until the former was re-
peatedly robbed of the tobacco he cached
beneath his pillow, wherewith to soothe him-
selt in wakeful watches of the night. He
accused Spud of larcenies, arid the repose of the
REMOVABLE.
JOHNNY: Mr. Smith, did I hear you ask for a lock of sister's hair?”
MR. SMITH : “ Yes, Johnnie, hut
JOHNNY : “ Well, if ye gimme threepence I’ll get ye a hanful. I know
where she keeps it.”
troop was often ruptured by lurid language
and two hairy veterans prancing around in abbre-
viated night-wear. Spud climaxed his offence
by—so Tokey affirmed—seizing the latter when
asleep by the heels and violently bashing his head
against the bungalow wall. There was pugilism
en deshabille at dead of night between the antique
warriors, and compulsory retirement to the guard-
room. Which things might have been obviated
had “ Foxy ’’ Smith (awake and enjoying trans-
actions) explained that it was Billy who stole and
ate the tobacco, and Billy who, incited thereto by
“Foxy,” accepting Tokey’s uncovered toes
waggling in the moonbeams as provocations to
combat, reined back and butted Tokey’s feet.
After Billy dis-
covered the
amount of holy
joy there was to
be snatched from
this kind of re-
laxation, he rang-
ed the bungalows
of nights seeking
and finding native
feet, and the re-
giment went to
hospital with
broken heads

vehemence that
he, in sight of
all men, described

J. EVISON.
A King in Exile,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
0, the Queen may keep her golden
Crown and sceptre of command !
I would give them both twice over
To be King of Babyland.
Sure, it is a wondrous country
Where the beanstalks grow apace,
And so very near the moon is
You could almost stroke her face.
And the dwellers in that country
Hold in such esteem their King,
They believe that if he chooses
He can do—just anything ;
And, although his regal stature
May be only four-feet-ten,
Think him tallest, strongest, bravest,
Noblest, wisest, best of men.
Ah, how fondly I remember
The good time serene and fair,
In the bygone years when I, too,
Was a reigning monarch there !
But my subjects they discrowned me
When they’d older, colder, grown,
And they took away my sceptre,
And upset my royal throne.
Yet, although a King in Exile,
Without subjects to command,
I am glad at heart to think I
Once was King of Babyland.

Saturday Review considers that no Judge
of English High Court should be allowed to sit
after 70 years of age, rarely after 65, and that
ordmardy Judges should be compelled to retire at
60. How would this work in Australia ?
Some years ago, when the British terri-
tories began to touch the Transvaal, the Cape
Government suggested that a certain degree of
longitude should be fixed as the Boer southern
boundary. The line, as marked on the map, was
inspected by the Boer authorities, and a commis-
sion sent out to view the country. It came back
!JT a weeks, much excited, and reported that
it had carefully examined the locality, but there
was no line there, and the existence of such lines
was evidently a lie invented by the English. The
Boer politicians imagined that a meridian was a
black streak on the earth’s surface, and they had
been looking for it.


Hume Nisbet paid a flying visit to Aus-
tralia recently, and reports that he has inspected
the present generation of Sydneyites, and finds
them a tired, degenerate race, out of which all
pluck and energy has departed—a weary, played-
out, jaundiced crowd, without mind and with a
thin, weedy body, which is used chiefly to make
an acute angle against a lamp-post outside a
public-house. From which The Bulletin assumes
that Mr. Nisbet’s books aren’t selling well in
Sydney just now. You can almost always tell
how any author’s books are selling in a city by the
way he cusses the inhabitants thereof.
If there is anything you want that you
have not got, write down to Hordern Bros., 203,
205, 207, 209, 211 Pitt-street, Sydney, for it. We
serve people in every town in N.S.W. Con-
tractors to the Govt, of N.S.W. for carpets,

The Master’s Mistake.
[For The Bulletin.]
William Spencer stayed away from school
that day, and the “master” wrote a “note” to
William’s father, and gave it to William’s brother
Joe to carry home.
“ You’ll give that to your father to-night,
Joseph.”
“Yes, sir.”
Bill waited for Joe near the gap, and walked
home with him.
“ I s’pose you’ve got a note for father.”
“ Yes,” said Joe.
“I s’pose you know what’s in it ? ”
“ Ye—yes. Oh, why did you stop away, Bill?”
“You don’t mean to say that your’e dirty mean
enough to give it to father ? Hey ? ”
“ I must, Will. I promised the master.”
“ He needn’t never know.”
“ Oh, yes, he will. He’s coming over to our
place on Saturday, and he’s sure to ask me to-
morrow.”
Pause.
“ Look here, Joe !” said Bill, “ I don’t want to
get a hiding and go without supper to-night. I
promised to go ’possuming with Jimmy Nowlett,
and he’s going to give me a fire out of his gun.
You can come, : too. I don’t want to cop out on it
to-nigh G-if I do I’ll run away from home again,
so there.”
Bill walked on a bit in moody silence; Joe, in
troubled silence.
Bill tried again : he threatened, argued, and
pleaded, but'Joe was firm. “The master trusted
me, Will,” he said.
“ Joe,” said Bill at 1; si, after a long pause, “I
wouldn’t do it to you.”
Joe was troubled.
“ I wouldn’t do it to you, Joe.”
Joe'thought how Bill had stood up and fought
for him only last week.
“I’d tear the note in bits; I’d tell a hundred
lies ; I’d take a dozen hidings first, Joe —I
would. ”
Joe was greatly troubled. His chest heaved
and the tears came to his eyes.
“I’d do more than that for you, Joe, and you
know it.”
Joe knew it. They were crossing the old gold-
field, now. There was a shaft close to the path ;
it had fallen in, funnel-shaped, at the top, but
was still 30 or 40 feet deep; some old logs were
jammed across about five feet down. Joe suddenly
snatched the note from his pocket and threw it in.
It fluttered to the other side and rested on a piece
of the old timber. Bill saw it, but said nothing,
and, seeing their father coming home from work,
they hurried on.
Joe was in trouble now. Bill tried to comfort
and cheer him, but it was no use. Bill promised
never to run away from home any more, to go to
school every day, and never to fight, nor steal, nor
tell lies. But Joe had betrayed his trust for the
first time in his life, and wouldn’t be comforted.
Some time in the night Bill woke, and found
Joe sitting up in bed crying.
“ Why, what’s the matter, Joe ? ”
“I never done a mean thing like that before,”
sobbed Joe. “ I wish I’d chucked meself down
the shaft instead. The master trusted me, Will;
an’ now, if he asks me to-morrow, I’ll have to tell
a lie.” ~
“ Then tell the truth, Joe, an’ take the hidin ;
it’ll be soon over —just a couple of cuts with the
cane and it’ll be all over.”
“Oh, no, it won’t. He won’t never trust me
any more. I’ve never been caned in that school
yet, Will, and if I am I’ll never go again. Oh !
why will you run away from home, Will, and
play the wag, and steal, and get us all into such
You don’t know how mother takes on
about it—you don’t know how it hurts father !
I’ve deceived the master, and mother and father
to-day, just because you’re so—so selfish,” and he
laid down and cried himself to sleep.
Bill lay awake and thought till daylight ; then
he got up quietly, put on his clothes, and stole away
from the house and across the flat, followed by the
dog, who thought it was some ’possum-huhting
expedition. Bill wished the dog would not be
quite so demonstrative until at least they got
away from the house. He went straight to the
shaft, let himself down carefully on to one of the
old logs, and stooped to pick up the note, gleam-
ing white in the sickly summer daylight. Then
the rotten “timber’’gave way suddenly, without
a moment’s warning.
» * * *
They found him that morning at about
nine o’clock. The dog attracted the attention of
an old fossicker passing to his work. The letter
was gripped in Bill’s right hand when they
brought him up. They took him home and the
father went for a doctor. Bill came to himself a
little just before the last, and said : “ Mother ! I
wasn’t running away, mother—tell father that—l
—I wanted to try and catch a ’possum on the

ground. . . Where’s Joe ? I want Joe. Go
out, mother, a minute, and send Joe. ”
“ Here I am, Bill,” said Joe, in a choking,
terrified voice.
“ Has the master bin yet ? ”
“No.”
“ Bend down, Joe. I went for the note, and
the logs gave way. I meant to be back before they
was up. I dropped it down inside the bed ; you
watch your chance and get it; and say you forgot it
last night—say you didn’t like to give it that

HENRY LAWSON.
Hungering and Thirsting.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Ever since she could remember, the
mother-love had been the ruling passion of her
life. As a child, filled with that pathetic faith
which a man had better be drowned in the depth
of the sea than destroy, she had clasped her rag-
and-sawdust doll to her breast, closed her eyes,
and prayed to God to turn it into a baby for her.
Once, in a burst of ecstatic delight, it seemed to
her that some responsive thrill answered the beat-
ing of her heart. When, at last, she dared to look
down, it was
with an agony
of disappoint-
ment that she
met that fool-
ish waxen
smile.
As a school-
girl she had
worshipped
each baby
that toddled
across her
path, and had
thought glad
thoughts and
dreamed sweet
dreams of her
own time that
was coming.
Clearly pray-
ers alone could
not help her,
so, with what
patience she
had, she wait-
ed until she
should be
grown up
enough to
marry.
* *
She had no
passion in her,
only tender,
motherly love.
A little of this
she gave to her
husband, and
all the rest she
stored up and
waited—wait-
ed at first
eagerly and
hopefully, and then with a restless uncertainty
hard to bear. , ~ „ A
And the months passed and then the years, ana
still the yearning agony of would-be motherhood
was unsatisfied. In dreams she quivered with the
rapture of the touch of baby fingers and hot, moist
little lips. Then poverty came and her dreams
by night and day were of the delight of denying
herself, of starving herself if need be, that little
mouths might be filled and little forms kept
vigorous. These remained only dreams.
“ I’ve sometimes been awfully down to think we
had no kiddies,” said her husband, worn with the
grind of poverty, “but we’ve both of us cause to
be thankful enough now.” But his wife said
n °Then"came better times, and still she waited
and waited and tried to hope, though she knew
that the thirst of her life could never bo quenched.
To the last the man did not know.
* * * *
He was brought home with a dislocated
spine and but a few hours between him and the
shadowy land. Sometimes he spoke, but more
often lay motionless thinking with an over-active
brain and counting the moments as they passed.
“I wish I could have left you better off,” he
said once ; “ but, thank God, there is no child to
burden you. Queer that I should have all my
wits about me when I am so smashed up.”
She pressed his hand and stooped to kiss him.
She walked to the window and leaned against the
frame. Those words rang through her brain
where all else was numb. ‘ ‘ Thank God there is
no child. Thank God there is no child.”
A sturdy, independent baby escaped from the
house opposite. With a face filled with the glory
of successful wrong-doing he staggered out, bare-
headed, into the hot sunshine. “You naughty
boy,” called the mother running after him, “ what
can mummy do with you ? ” She caught him up
with a little shake, then clasped him close and
kissed his face all over as she ran with him back
to the verandah. The shrill baby-laughter echoed
across the road. “ Thank God there is no child!”
The woman bowed her head upon the arms that
rested on the window-ledge, and the tears dropped
through her fingers slowly as if keeping time to
the man’s last lingering moments, dragging pain-
fully to an end.
