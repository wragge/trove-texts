This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now bears his name, re-
ceived his medical education and surgical training
in the loading colleges and hospitals of Europe,
lie has devoted a Ufa- time to the study of
Nervous Complaints.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated; with those widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to hli
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more uu
happiness than any other class of troubles tha-
alllict mankind,

head, pimples, a fear that something dreadful is
about to happen, weak stomach, yellow or blood-

CLOTH BOUND BOOK,
showing plainly how all diseases, which result in
the above-named symptoms, may be cured with-
out unnecessary expense. This book will prove a
valuable companion, and even though you be per-
fectly well, its general information and prescrip-
tions may assist you in restoring some poor friend
to health, even though his case has been previously
pronounced incurable.
One Pound is Sufficient to Send
for remedies necessary to cure any ordinary com
plaint. Should you require medical treatment, as
procrastination is sometimes dangerous, it would
be advisable for you to sit down quietly in your
chamber and write to the Doctor detailing all
experienced symptoms. He will, on receipt of
such a letter, write you promptly and courteously
a candid and straightforward opinion of your
case. If you do not think you understand your
case, send for his famous medical work, the price
of which is but 6d. ; enclosed in the volume
will be found a list of carefully-prepared questions
which will assist you materially in describing
your ailments. Dr. Richards uses nothing but
the purest remedies, and never prescribes injurious
drugs under any circumstances. Dr. Richards
has successfully treated nearly 30,000 cases since
coming to Australia, and has permission from, at
least, 15,000 persons to show their written evidence
of his success. All communications should bo

BATURDAY, FEBRUARY 11, 1893.
The Political Circle.
Australian politics move in (i narrow circle.
Within that circle they travel round and
found with dire monotony, but they never,
by any chance, get beyond it. There is an
impression abroad that Australia is a strik-
ingly progressive and democratic country,
but that is chieily because it is always just
on the point of enacting some great Liberal
measure which invariably misses realisation
by a hair’s breadth. When it is just on the
Verge of realisation Australia is at the top-
most point of its periodical revolution ; then
it travels round again to the naair of
ancient Conservatism, and after that the
whole process begins afresh. Victoria was
within an ace of Republicanism when Berry
was laying foundations of his “ Broken
heads and flaming houses ” Cabinet, but
nothing tangible came of that famous
Crusade. Then ensued a period of Conser-
vatism and reaction. Next followed the
agitation for the abolition of the plural
property-vote, and after that measure had
twice collapsed, just when, to all appearance,
its success was nearly assured, the Patterson
Cabinet of old, solid, time-crusted capitalists
appeared on the scene, and things have
practically got back to the position they
occupied in the days of M'Cullocii and
O’Shan assy. Queensland was seemingly
about the most progressive province on
earth a very few years ago, when MTlwhaith
raised the tattered, half - mast flag of
“Nationalism.” That was the culminating
point of Liberalism in the North, and then in
the hour of triumph the “National” move-
ment unaccountably went to pieces, its
leaders all apostatised, and the Kanaka
Coalition undid in two years all that had
been achieved in a decade of apparent pro-
gress. And, as for New South Wales, it is
now apparently just starting on the down-
ward grade of reaction, and its progress is
an interesting study.
• • *
The advent of the Labour-party in Parlia-
ment was the most promising moment in
Now South Wales history. It was the
moment when everything seemed to be pos-
siblo—the beginning of a new era —the clay of
virtuous intentions and great purposes. Since
then many good things have nearly hap-
pened. The Manhood Suffrage Bill has
almost become law on two occasions, and is
now tottering in the balance for the third
time. The Eight-hours’ principle has just
missed legal recognition. The establishment
of a Local Government system has seemed
once or twice to be approaching. The
Government which manipulated the Broken
Hill trials in the interests of the great silver
companies, by handing miners over to the
mercies of a squatting jury instead of trying
them on neutral, ground, was almost dis-
missed from office with the execration it
deserved. An era of economy and com-
parative honesty appeared, at one time, as if
it was just going to commence. A genuine
system of Protection seemed to be almost
assured. And, after all, nothing has been
done, except that the Discs Cabinet has
created many new billets for its friends, and
the finances are more disorganised than
before, and the Labour - party is practi-
cally broken asunder, and Protection is in
imminent danger of dying unborn, and the
old, unprincipled hacks are struggling for
office in the same old way, as they have
always done.
* # #
There is a certain melancholy interest in
counting up the obstacles which always bring
every attempt atreform to the same inglorious
conclusion. It is apparently impossible to
achieve anything in the Lower House until
Party Government—that snag on which
everything is wrecked sooner or later—is
finally abolished. Under the present sys-
tem it takes the Legislature all its time to
exist, and there is no leisure for anything
else. Yet Party Government cannot be
abolished until the nation realises the im-
potence of the present methods, and the
nation is exceedingly slow and supremely
apathetic. When it has made up its mind,
the measure for the abolition of Party
Government must first of all be passed by
the Party Legislature, and that unspeak-
able body is now almost incapable of passing
anything. And should the measure, by any
chance, find its way as far as the Council, its
prospects there are infinitesimal. Until the
nominee Council is abolished the abolition of
Party Government is practically hopeless,
and until Party Government is abolished the
abolition of the nominee Council is as nearly
impossible as anything belonging to this
earth can well be.
• * #
Every important measure of reform which
is not effectually destroyed by the Party
system in the Assembly is lost later on in the
Council. Therefore the lamentable impo-
tence of the former body is not quite so
great a disaster as it seems, for the final
result would probably be much the same in
any case. The abolition of the Council can
only be effected with its own consent, and as
it is absolutely hopeless to expect any such
consent from that body as at present consti-
tuted the removal of the obstruction—even
should the Assembly give a unanimous vote
for its removal —is more than difficult. The
only hope lies in swamping the Upper House
with a sufficient number of democratic
nominees pledged to pass a bill for their own
political destruction, and even this appar-
ently simple course of procedure is attended
by many drawbacks. It is necessary, in the
first place, that the nation should announce,
through the medium of the ballot, its fixed
determination that the Council shall be
“swamped,” and it is almost impossible,
among the many dozen confused issues which
go to make up a general election, for the
nation to announce an unmistakeablc deter-
mination of any kind. Having achieved
thisapparent impossibility, there is absolutely
no means ot preventing the Government or
the Legislature going back on its pledges.
As a matter of fact the Government and the
Legislature almost invariably do go back on
their pledges. And if they do not, the vice-
regal veto has to be reckoned with, and the
veto of the imperial power which is behind
the viceroy, and it is only when all these
obstacles have been overcome that anything
can be accomplished.
* * #
When the Council has been filled with
sufficient democratic nominees to command
a majority—should things ever get so far—
it will be essential to proceed quickly.
Politicians degenerate rapidly in that un-
wholesome atmosphere ; not a few presum-
able democrats have been sent there at
different times, and almost every one has
immediately thereafter sank into conserva-
tism of the most incurable and hopeless
type. But even a majority cannot always
command success under modern political
conditions ; the measure may still be stone-
walled into extinction in either branch of
the Legislature. Should it pass, however, it
will, of necessity, be held over by the Gover-
nor for the consideration of the British
authorities, and its veto by the Crown
is a foregone conclusion. If a measure is
passed by a “colonial ” Legislature over and
over again, and presented to the Crown year
after year with dogged, unfailing persistence,
that emblem of authority generally gives
way in the end. But the bill for the aboli-
tion of the propertied chamber, once vetoed,
would probably vanish for a decade. Before
the new members attained their second year
in the nominee House the democratic
phalanx would have gone to pieces, and the
democratic party would bo a thing of the
past. The love of irresponsible power—if it
is only the power to block progress and incur
popular execration —is implanted in almost
every human soul; and the Legislative
Councillor—who is responsible to no one
except Death, and who, in some cases, is
hardly responsible even to it, inasmuch as
he owes the Reaper a bill at four-score years
date and postpones payment indefinitely—is
the most irresponsible individual in the entire
commonwealth. It is just possible to create
forty new councillors, pledged by all they
hold sacred to vote their own abolition, but
it would almost certainly be difficult to find
fifteen who would be true to their pledges
twelve months after their elevation,
* * #
The short road out of all those complica-
tions is by popular revolution. But the hot
fit of insurrectionary fervor is always suc-
ceeded by the cold fit of loyalism and apathy,
and no two provinces, as a rule, are of the
same mind at any given time, and for any
one province to attempt to assert itself
against the Imperial power, unless supported
by all the rest of the Australias, is worse
than hopeless. Revolution cannot come
with any promise of success until Federa-
tion is ’ accomplished, and Federation is
difficult of accomplishment, for the popular
Chambers of at least three of the six Aus-
tralian provinces are willing to federate only
on a democratic basis, while the Upper
Houses will only federate on the basis of
abject grovel and servile obedience to the
Imperial authority. Moreover, there are
as many different brands of democratic senti-
ment as there are Legislatures, and every
one of the six Chambers which represent
Property has its own particular variety of
grovel, concerning which no two seem likely
to agree. Therefore, things go round in-
definitely in the same old circle, and bring
up regularly at the same old starting-point.
To a united Australia —united, not neces-
sarily in form, but in sentiment everything
is possible. But to a disunited and apathetic
nation, the bonds of the political system
with which Britain has cursed these pro-
vinces are fetters which it is practically im-
possible to break.
The Fat Lord Justice of the Federation.
[AN OPEN LETTER TO EDMUND BARTON.]
(Per favour of THE BULLETIN.)
My Dear Sir—l have long lacked opportunity to
say to you certain things which, in my egotism, I
fancied it would be good for you to hear, and
hastening to embrace the occasion afforded by
your latest utterances on Federation, I now
trouble you with a few words.
On 2nd April, 1891, in the Federal Convention,
in the course of the debate on Part 111, clause 25
of the “ Draft Constitution ’’—the clause defining
the qualification of electors of members of the
House of Representatives—you said (Reports
p.G2O, octavo edition : p. 300, folio edition) :
It is very desirable that there should be a National
Franchise.
By that meaning a uniform “ One-man-one-vote ”
franchise.
Further you said ; (Reports, p.G29, Bvo. edition 5
p. 304, folio edition): —
If it is a desirable thing that the people of the whole
Commonwealth being fellow-citizens, and being equally
fellow citizens for that purpose, should vote equally, then
there can be no question that the suffrage throughout the
Commonwealth should be uniform.
Later still you said (Reports, p. 630, Bvo.
edition ; p. 305 folio edition): —
From the beginning 1 have held the opinion that if we
constitute a free Parliament in a free country we must
give the House most directly responsible to Hie people the
right of fixing the franchise. We must allow the people
to fix their franchise. We must, therefore, look to the
people of the Commouwe. Ith to constitute a franchise
upon which they shall be represented in the House of
Representatives. If we do not, we are not adding to the
liberty of the states or people ; but are taking something
away.
Yet again you said :
I feel most strongly my principle in this matter.
And to adequately express your “principle"
you moved an amendment which, had it been
carried, would have liberalised the Draft Consti-
tution and have corrected many misgivings now
entertained (and most properly entertained) as to
the scope and aim of that measure. You saw
then clearly enough the ridiculous anomaly of
constituting a Parliament to make laws for a now
nation, while at the same time refusing to that
Parliament the right to a power which, in the
nature of things, must be existent before the laws
can be made —the power to define its own electoral
basis. That was your position less than two
years ago. You were then glowing with en-
thusiasm, and possessed of an exaltation of mind
at being among the nation-makers—at being one
of the elect spirits to whom fortune had granted
the supreme boon of carving the matrix of des-
tinies which might outleap in splendour and glory
the farthest limit of poetic vision. That was your
position—and now?
# # #
I take Hansard, No. 2G of the current session,
and on page 3009 you are reported to have said
(on Jan. 11): —
I have become convinced that the Convention did
right in rejecting a certain amendment v Ivcb I proposed.
That is, the amendment above referred to and
quoted below. On the next page, continuing your
remarks, Hansard makes you say
If we impose arbitrary conditions in the first instance,
hon. members will see that it is fatal to that frank inter-
change of views which must prevail in the [proposed]
Convention if its labours arc to result in good.
And, by a later remark, you make it plain that
by “arbitrary conditions’’ you mean a proposal
identically the same as your own in tke Conven-
tion of 1891. Here is your amendment: —
The Parliament of the Commonwealth may make laws
prescribing a uniform qualification cf electors of members
of the House of Representatives.
And here is Mr. Kelly’s proposal :
That no system of Federation w ill be acceptable io this
House until the electoral system provides for the principle
of one-man-one-vote at the election of numbers to the
proposed House of - Representatives.
Your amendment and Mr, Kelly’s are the same
(allowing for the obscurity of Mr. Kelly’s notions
as to the “ electoral system ”), but how diversely
they have appeared to you ! The former was “ a
matter of principle ” to which you were pledged
“from the beginning the latter is an arbitrary
condition “which you oppose tooth and nail.”
Two years ago the radical idea of Federation, a
uniform franchise—divergent franchises must be
unequal franchises, and a just Federation can
only be that of co-oi’dinate and equal units—was
with you a principle, vital and enduring. Now
it is a thing of prejudice, arbitrary, without root
in justice. Wdience this change? Within two
years how tremendous a difference ! Why?
# * *
The reason is to be found in that tendency in
Nature, so destructive to political reputations
which declares that, the instant a man palters
with his highest convictions, he shall sow the
seeds of his own decadence. Your highest convic-
tions two years ago “ kept step with the Hag of the
Union’’—the Union as it appeared to you
with your clear and ideal-seeking vision,
lint within a few months of the dipersion
o the Convention it became evident to
Cose observers of your career —there are many
such —that you were shifting base. It would be
a poor compliment to your intelligence to assert
that yon wore uneonscious you were doing so, and
as you are one of those men who would as soon
have a compliment to your intelligence as to your
rectitude, I do not intend to excuse your defect
of judgment by approving the goodness of your
intention. A man of your keenness and insight
does not get into a false position without knowing
it. When, in the latter part of 1891, you assumed
office, you did it against your better judgment,
which warned you against uniting yourself (on
terms dictated by the very men whom but a few
months before yon bad denounced as enemies to
the federal idea) with blundering and unintelligent
provincialists such as Dibbs, Salomons, and
Slattery. There are provincialists who recognise
that Federation cannot reach the organic stage
for five or ton years, and that, therefore, in the
meantime, it is the duty of N.S.W. to study her
internal development. And there are provineial-
ists who will be provincialists always, even though
Federation were consummated to-morrow.' Of this
latter type were the majority of your colleagues.
You knew it, none better; for you have dinned
the fact into their ears till the iteration and
reiteration must have penetrated even the most
pachydermatous of them. Yet you joined them,
surely conscious in that very act that you were
bartering some of the strength which draw's its
nutriment only from the single heart; for the fleet-
ing dignity and emolument of office —and some
other things ! Conscious you were, I repeat the
words; for you are too shrewd not to have
measured your gains and your losses. You must
have apprehended to the full that your enthusiasm
for Federation would dash itself to pieces against
the disguised antagonism of some, and the more
dangerous inertness of others, of your colleagues.
The prognosis of the hour was that you would not
convert your colleagues to a genuine belief in the
Federal principle but that they would modify you,
# * *
The prognosis was correct; time has gone by and
you have manifested acute Tory symptoms which
have pleased nobody but your enemies, and such
of your club friends whose parasitical intimacy
with you is more fatal to your best self than any
shafts from your foes’ quivers. The measure of
the modification you have undergone is proved by
the divergence of thought and tone between your
speeches in the Convention and your speech on
11th January this year; between yourself when
you seemed inspired (as John Mill said of Austin)
by “ an equal devotion to the two ciudiu'aJ poihls
of Liberty and Duty,” and yourffcjUas'you were
when you stood sneering ,atsKcly’s arguments—
not an iota of which bqtUwas' drawn from your
Convention reasoning,. -
# * #
From Liberalism to Toryism the path is often
trodden, but seldom indeed in recent history have
men made the journey when so noble a prospect
spreads before the Liberal track and when retro-
gression means the revival of
. . All the years of fierce unrest and peril,
And slaves, and lords, and broken blades, and graves.
And still more rarely have such men as yourself
sot their steps towards the goal of the reaction-
aries. It is usually men whose successes are dead
and gone, and men who have never enjoyed suc-
cess, who have thus turned their backs to the
Future and sought from the King-damned Past
nourishment for soul and body ; and not men such
as you in whose veins should How all manful cur-
rents, and whose as yet unpalsiod imagination
should thrill and start aflame with the thought of
beholding the sundawn of a new era. You were
never a Camille Desmoulins, but you set out in
life with thoughts as high as his for the people’s
good - hatred as intense as his for
The world of Gods and Kings, of shrine and state,
.and one would as soon have dreamt of Camille, had
his head not fallen into the basket, quenching those
hopes and relaxing that hatred, as of you dimming
the light within you by a curtain dyed with blood
stains born of Caste and Privilege, and woven by
the fools who
. . . Out rear the tides of time
And bid the world’s wave back.
## t #
You have divorced yourself from the true ideal
of Australia. That ideal is not Toryism, which
lias a fit home, it fit home it has anywhere, only
in curse-con seer ated countries, but a Federal
Republicanism which shall give to every human
being within the bounds of our country an equality
of opportunity and an equality before the law—»
Federal Republicanism which shall know no aris-
tocracy save that of character, and which shall
divest even that aristocracy of as much as*
shadow of political privilege—a Federal Repnou-
cauisin that shall refuse the priceless crown of its
citizenship alike to the English aristocrat who
insults average humanity by professing to , be
above it, and to the Chinese and the Kanaka who,
by the Cdd tbe brutish monarchy takes umieri ?
patronage, are condemned to be below it. I* l ®
people of “The Last of the Lands ” arc wo. Ij 1
Australian ideal shall make us the people of tu ?
first ! Is this a dream—a fantasy—a f r ® n iU
Belter, even so, the most fleeting glimpse of tn*
ideal than one blast ing and blasted fact generate
in your liaison with Toryism.
• • #
When Geoi’ge Uiginbotham died, there p* sS ®
away the one public man in Australia whoW
would have been absolutely safe to praise w
alive, and as to whom, therefore, it is sate
affirm that no record “ shall leap to 1 iffht
shame his memory now that he is dead. Had y,
remained true to yourself, the day might—m
would -have come when that similar dual awn
tion might, or would, have been made of y° u - ..
tbe side of every public man in life there wa ’’
invisible, the all-seeing, all-knowing wraith o
historian. It is the agent of Posterity au ‘
Fate; and by its ghostly fingers tears the
from that which has lain hidden and the _
that was done in secret. What Higmbo .
feared was the revelation of hisj
humanities. And, you ? What-do you fear.
* * • j
Shall I put it into words, or leave the* 1 j
mute? It is because I think much of you 1
apeak; if I did not believe that there wa.
force, ardour, aspiration, generosity l ocl #
your nature, you should, for all 1 would oa
unrobuked to your own particular nook i


Tory hell. But because it is not too late for you
to recant your recantation, I presume to answer
my own question. You fear the disclosure, not
(like so many of your co-members of that “august
assembly” of ’9l, the Convention) of cronk
balance-sheets, and sexual immoralities, and
bogus cheques—but of the secret dealings with
the Imperialists, which have now brought you to
the level of those who feel themselves worthless
unless stamped with “Imperial honours”—honours
granted, as a rule, by some hee-hawing idiot in the
Colonial Office, who owes his position to the cir-
cumstance that Becky Sharp has sold herself once
again to my Lord Steyne. To their level you
have come —to the level of the creatures who have
no conception of what manhood is; and who view
with hatred and horror the idea of a democracy
that knows no distinction save that of manhood.
To their plane you have descended —to the plane
3f the base souls who, themselves slaves, crave for
the “ preservation of a ‘ lower order ’ ” of helots
who will be their slaves; and to that end pray to
their idols that these Australias shall remain an
Imperial satrapy to the crack o’ doom. To the
anticipatory inferno of this companionship—you
are not so lost that you do not feel it such—you
have come, and the disclosures you fear, or at
least have reason to fear, are of the methods which
have effected your degradation.
# * #
From being a heart-whole Australian, the com-
pass-needle of whose hopes trembled once towards
the pole of the Republic, you have merged into the
parasite of an Empire whose morning drum-beats
sound in no latitude that does not bear witness
that her throne rests upon human greed and
human agony. The process of transformation
began when you bartered your independence as an
advocate of Federalism for present office, and —(?)
—a prospective seat on the Federal Judiciary.
You were the “ strong man ” of the Cabinet, but
Lemuel Gulliver could have told you how multi-
plied littlenesses can bind the strong and let out
his strength. Limb by limb you were bound, and
degree by degree was your strength stolen till
your clear perceptions as to what was required as
the basic principle of the Federation —a
pure, absolute Democracy—became dulled. Your
vital and enduring “principle” has now passed
into the category of “arbitrary conditions.” You
would have trusted the people absolutely; now you
will not trust them at all. Your initial error
placed you under the thumb of the persons who
hate and dread the Democracy, and drop by drop
has the virus of distrust entered your veins. When
a man is so affected it is the most natural of con-
sequences that he succumbs to the contagion of
Imperialism. Distrust man adore the king-
animal : this is an equation. Crush the political
worth of man as man, and you buttress the ideas
of monarchy—of vice-royalty—of aristocracy—of
titular distinctions. Deprive man as man of his
political power by giving to some other men power
of manhood plus the power of property and rank,
and you create privilege, the appendage of royalty.
When you, Edmund Barton, seek to endow the
Federal representative who is elected on a limited
and privileged franchise with equality of power to
that granted to another representative by the
absolute manhood franchise, you seek to create a
new privilege because the former’s vote is cast for
potentially more than the latter’s. You are doing
this consciously, with your eyes open to the conse-
quences of your action. And the primary effect
will be that the Federation will have an Imperial
character from the first moment of union. Restrict
the basis of the popular Chamber, and you impart
a Tory character quality to the whole structure.
This you design—you and your co-conspirators;
with what ultimate object he who will read
between the lines shall understand.
* * *
Make the Popular House of Representatives in
the Federation a breeding-nest for Toryism and
verily you shall have your reward ! Griffith, as
Chief Justice, yourself, and that insect on the
coat-tails of British aristocracy, Way, as his col-
leagues; Parkes (if he is not in his grave) as
First Prime Minister, or, failing him, Giilies ;
Dibbs as Ambassador for the “Commonwealth’
(which a Tory chamber will make into “Dominion”
in a short space)—oh, you and your brother
plotters have already filled to a messengership the
posts which shall be subordinate to the Viceroy—
His Lordship the Earl of Carington ! There will
be, you think, no obstacle in your path once the
Tory character is imparted to the whole Federa-
tion. With the myriad social and mercantile and
financial wires which connect the Australias to
the “centre of the Empire” vibrating to the
touch of the Imperial Federationists; with the
groat London papers forging British opinion by
means of purblind Miss Shaws; with the reptile
press of our own great cities hungrier for the
sovereigns of the Imperialistic advertisers than for
the pence of the democratic reader ; with almost
every woman in the country selling herself in a
fashion for the inane smile of a viceregal flunkey,
and robbing her children of independence so that
she may eat cake and drink tea and be stonily
glared upon at vice-regal receptions ; with these
forces on your side and co-operating with your
lory Chamber, you will soon, you calculate, do
the trick 1 These are for you ! And against you
what? Only—pooh!—the spirit of Democracy
and the soul of the Revolution !
* • #
But that spirit and that soul, sooner or later,
subdue all things. The amazing fact to the
student of history is that the man whom of all
men the moral most concerns, the politician, is
the last to perceive that power to be enduring
must be erected on the widest basis possible. The
history of all countries in all ages has writ this
truth so large that he cannot help but read it who
preserves the single eye. The consolidating and
civilising force everywhere has been the
broadening down ” of liberty; the disruptive
and destructive and anarchistic agencies have in-
variably moved parallel to encroachments on
P°P’ r l } ar liberties. The immortal anachronism is
the lory; and he is so because madness is im-
mortal, and the gods drive mad whom they wish
to destroy. The Tory is doomed to madness and
therefore to destruction inasmuch as he is a traitor
to our common humanity. He creates privilege
to live by it, knowing all the while with the mad-
man s cunning that each fragment of privilege is
jV°y stolen from a fellow-man. There is no thief
ike the privilege-creator, and because he wrongs
cum ant ty and does not enrich it, his destruction
maybe delayed but can never be averted. He
wars against the universal conscience which as
ceaselessly _as irresistibly fights on the side of
“ A few philosophical renegades ”
so wntes Heine—“ from freedom may forge for
us the most elaborate chains of conclusions, to
f i VG j a *' millions of men are born to be beasts
1 burden for a few thousand nobles, but they will
never convince us until they make it clear, to bor-
row the expression of Voltaire, that the former
nro born with saddles on their backs, and the
alter with spurs on their heels.” Has it been
reserved for a Toby Barton to correct Voltaire
and Heme, those seers of the Ages who could
epitomise an epoch in a sentence ?
• * #
cannot correct them, and, therefore, if you
permanently take your stand with the privilege-
creators and privilege-mongers you take your
stand with the damned souls whom History only
arraigns to convict of treason to the highest ideals
of the race. Laugh, if you choose, at the import-
ance we Republicans attach to the influence of
titles, of rank, of militarism; laugh, if you please,
at what you may term an exaggerated concern
for trifles, but if they be trifles why should you
apologise and contend for them? Because you
know that titles, the badges of rank, the pomp of
militarism, are symbols and emblems of the most
vicious elements of national life —of Caste, Privi-
lege, and Monopoly. You cannot differentiate
the Few from the Many without appending an
inch of red ribbon or a piece of sparkling stone to
their dress, and a letter or two to their names.
Then, as the fool human ever persists in taking
the symbol for the thing symbolised, and the form
for the idea, you induce men and women to crave
for the possession of the bauble or the coloured
rag, in the delusion that they thus obtain the
original attributes of rank —power, admiration,
and respect. The evil does not end, therefore,
with the possessors of the bauble and the rag, but
influences others by the introduction of false
standards of life and vitiated principles of living.
Hence the Republican, who believes in no stan-
dard of life but simple worth, fights not only with
Caste, Privilege, and Monopoly, but with their
symbols. Both the thing and its symbol he will
resist to the death, as he would an invasion, for
he is conscious that an armed enemy could do no
more than destroy the nation’s manhood, and that
the subtle foe of Privilege aims at doing no less.
And, as the tocsin rang out when through the
dykes of Holland trickled the feeblest of leaks, so
does the Republican now sound an alarm when
the advancing sails of the Imperialists are but
specks on the horizon. It is you, and such as you,
who are inviting the squadrons of Imperialism to
the gates of Australia—who seek to bind these
virgin shores in immutable alliances with an
Empire so void of simplicity and truth that the
Sovereign is habitually addressed as though she
were God’s Yice-Gerent, that permits gambling
lechers of Princes to sway its judgment as though
they were Archangels, that gives to a Peer of the
Realm—a Carington or an Ailesbury—the same
title it confers upon the Cheist.
* # »
The people of Federated Australia will demand
liberty to live and to grow in their own way,
without reference to Imperialistic wishes, or to
the undisclosable designs of present-day Imperial
spies, and whatever the bonds with which you and
your fellow-wordspinners have bound the limbs of
the nascent nation, they shall be rent as though
they were gossamer thread. So your labour shall
be in vain ! How egregious the folly that could
think otherwise, and how short-sighted you fools
will discover you have been when you learn, as
every man who distrusts the people learns in time,
that the thing for which you worked has vanished
in the twinkling of an eye. In the instant that
an enemy of Britain—not an enemy of Australia,
for she will have none save Britain—points a gun
at our shores, in that instant will severance be
effected. What will then become of the fabric
you and others are so painfully—and at such a cost
of personal honour—striving to erect ? What will
then avail your Tory diplomacy, and your Tory
Chambers, and your Viceroyships, and your
“Imperial honours?” You will then discover
you might as well have attempted to bind the
tides of the ocean with ropes of moonbeams.
• * #
In the interests, not of Australia (for one man
or a thousand men, more or less, cannot affect the
ultimate destinies of the Commonwealth), but of
yourself, I implore you to re-consider your posi-
tion. Get back to simplicity and sincerity, and
escape from the atmosphere of the special pleader’s
den to the larger ether which encompasses
the Australian ideal. As a man, you pride
yourself on being straightforward and on saying
what you mean. As a politician, why should you
bo and act differently? When you used these
words, reported in Hansard (p. 300 G) a few days
ago, you spoke as a lawyer anxious to gain a point
which you dare not disclose, and not as a states-
man :
There is a phraseology in the drafting of statutes which
conveys a certain meaning to those accustomed to inter*
pret such instruments, and that is not the meaning put
upon the words at first sight.
You were then replying to “irrational criticism’’
of the text of the Constitution—the “irra-
tional criticism’’ of men who demand that the
Draft Bill shall say what it is designed to say, and
who affirm that it shall possess no esoteric mean-
ing. Who are to interpret the Constitution ? Not
a few quibbling lawyers, but the people of Aus-
tralia. It is to be their common possession, and
are they not to understand their charters? If they
are not, why not relapse into Norman-French
and bastard-Latin at once? But, as a simple
fact, the Draft Constitution is so coherently and
lucidly drawn that the presumption is most
strong that what is not disclosed is not
intended to bo disclosed, and what is implied
is not intended to be explicitly expressed.
The hour, however, is gone by when people were
content to entrust “to those accustomed to inter-
pret such instruments”—the cozening augurs of
the law—their rights and liberties; and the hour
has struck when they shall insist on knowing to
what they are committed. If the points urged
against you, say, with reference to the powers of
the Governor-General, are but “puerile verbal
distinctions,” why do you lay such stress on their
maintenance? He is a poor tactician who cannot
concede non essentials ; and as you are far from
being a failure as a strategist, wo are entitled to
hold that these points are not accidents or trifles,
but of the very nature of essentials. The Repub-
lican position is that they are essentials—to the
Imperial Federationist!
# * #
No, sir, refuse to recognise the radical idea
of Australian Federalism, and the current of
national feeling will be of such measureless
strength that it will fling you and your co-workers
for Imperialism into the maelstrom of destruction.
Keeping your eyes, as you do, on the Crown and
the Colonial Office, and refusing to look at the
Star of the Republic which alone can guide you
into the haven of the Australian Future, you,
steering across an uncharted deep, cannot escape
the suction which will destroy you. Look you at
Parkes; look you at Griffith ! Would you to-day
change your comparatively spotless name for their
position with their fame? Parkes long ago sold
himself to has of late sold
himself to Caste and Privilege and Monopoly;
and to day they are already enrolled among the
Iscariots of history. Before it is too late,
take warning. Public opinion is not voiced by
your toadies in the “ Service ” and your parasites
of the Athenaeum Club. The public of Australia
demand a Free Federation ; and your one chance
of enduring fame is to become the mouthpiece of
that demand. Give yourself over to the Im-
perialists, and though you may hereafter, as
the fat Lord Justice, enjoy the emolu-
ments of treachery in the privilege of being
addressed as “My Learned Brother!” by His
Honor the lean Lord Chief Justice Iscariot, you
and your reward shall be like the brief lives of the
insects of a summer noon, which are born, and
breathe, and die. With much respect, dear sir, I
remain, yours very truly, Price Warung.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Belittling Lalor.
The saddest feature of the recent Lalor
statue ceremony at Ballarat was the egotistical
claptrap oration of Duncan Gillies —whoclaims
to have been Peter’s mate, but who certainly
didn’t work with Peter when the bullets were
about. Gillies talked not so much to the
glory of the Eureka hero as to the glory of the
Parliamentary gang who had no particular
liking for Lalor. The pompous little man
stood, in effect, upon the head of the statue
and howled about the men who “ have made
Victoria what it is ” —which is probably much
dirtier than it would have been if most of them
had died on the day they landed. Lalor, in
his very minor capacity of Speaker, was the
theme into which Duncan discharged his naus-
eating gas. He puffed out his cheeks and de-
clared that—“lt required greatqualities truly to
perform the duties of Speaker. The Speaker
must be a man possessed of deep knowledge and
ability to place that knowledge clearly before
the House.” In other words, Duncan was say-
ing— “Look at me and my friend Tom Bent,
on the right. We are the stuff of which
Speakers are generally made, and we are
Great.” This exalting of public life by men
who move in public life is an insufferable fraud
that ought to be cried down in the interests of
young children, and all who are at all likely to
be influenced by it. And out upon the miser-
able suggestion that the statue erected in
honour of Peter Lalor is a statue to a
Speaker ! The sturdy ex-insurgent, untitled
Lalor, was naturally “ a credit to the House,”
but it isn’t as an elderly gentleman with long
experience of senatorial fiddle-de-dee—as the
predecessor of Matthew Davies and Bent, the
colleague of “great” persons like Duncan
Gillies, that the pride of Ballarat will be re-
membered in years to come.
A rampant Tory, signing himself “ Norwood
Young,” writes from Wellington (M.L.) to the
National Observer (London) bn the horrors
of having a Labour-party in politics. The fol-
lowing is a fair sample of Norwood’s mode of
reasoning
Their (the Labour-party’s) ideals are State Socialism
and Oommunisnn . , . State Socialism attacks the
risrht of an individual to the free use of his capacities,
Communism is levelled at the right of an individual to the
ownership of that which is the result of the free use of his
capaci ties—property,
This looks dreadful, no_ doubt, but it isn’t quite
so horrible on close inspection. Man has many
capacities, and if he had the free use of them
Mr. Young would probably be the first to
shriek for assistance. He has a capacity for
thieving, for instance, and if he had the free
use of that he would probably leave
Mr, Young penniless and stark naked. He
has a capacity for fighting, and would gladly
batter Mr. Y oung out of all semblance to
humanity. He has a capacity for wilful mis-
chief, and would like to set fire to Mr. Young’s
house, and he has a matrimonial capacity, and
would be glad to bolt with Mr. Young’s most
attractive feminine relative. Also, he has a
latent capacity for cruelty, and if the law
didn’t keep him in check, he, or some of him,
would gladly fasten Mr. Young on top of a hot
stove. Mr. \ouno complains because the
Labour - party doesn’t allow man the free
use of his capacities, but most of his capacities
are bad ones, and the great object of civilisation
is to prevent him using them. Moreover, man
has a capacity for making new social experi-
ments, and when he uses this capacity Mr.
Young howls. And, as for the right of man to
the ownership and the free use of the property
which he gets by his capacities—suppose the
property were Mr. Young’s spoons, and he got
them by his capacity for burgling, or suppose it
were a keg of dynamite which he had acquired
by honest industry, and he insisted on keeping
it in the house next door to Mr. Young’s !
Would that gentleman, or any other Tory, be
prepared to go the whole social hog, and assert,
under these conditions, that every man is
entitled to the free use of his capacities and the
ownership of whatever he may get by them ?
Maoriland can now count with reasonable
confidence on a cash surplus of £500,000 at the
end of March. The natural and immediate
result is that the symptoms of a universal howl
for reduced taxation are already apparent. It
is the curse of Australasian finance that always
when a surplus appears—if it is only a surplus
of £lO,OO0 —and very often when it doesn’t
appear, there is an instantaneous demand for
less taxation. When the Treasury is unusually
hard-up it means more loans to fill the gap, but
when the Treasury is aliluent it never, by any
possible chance, means an attempt to pay off
any part of the national burdens. If there is
a shortage of £lOO,OOO or £200,000 it is
generally carried forward in the hope that it
will somehow or other contrive to square itself
next year ; as for the surplus, it is never carried
forward by any chance or possibility—there is
an immediate rush to spend it twice over on the
spot. The Ballance Government has begun
well ; if it wants to keep on well it should lay
it down as a cast-iron rule that there will be no
decrease of taxation until Maoriland has paid
off every cent of its public indebtedness, and it
should begin the good work by applying its
£500,000 surplus to extinguishing as much as
possible of the old, high-priced loans, which the
province floated in the days when it first began
its career of financial derangement. Maoriland
is just now on the high tide of prosperity ; if it
can do nothing now towards extinguishing its
liabilities, what prospect is there when the in-
evitable depression comes back again, as the
depression always does, sooner or later?
The Queensland Labour-party has issued its
programme for the coming general election, and
it is gratifying to notice that it is altogether
unlike the weird, unfinished policy lately pro-
pounded—presumably on behalf of the party—
by Olassey, M. P, The following are its lead*
ing features :
One-maii-one-vote, all elections on one day, abolition of
the nominee Chamber, State control of water conserva-
tion and irrigation, State-aided village settlement, a State
bank; secular education, elementary to be compulsory
and higher to be optional, both free, in the State schools;
a statutory eight-hour day where practicable; a Shops
and Factories Act and a Mines Act, giving protection to
miners; an Act for the inspection of land boilers and
machinery ; a Lien Wages Act, a State Department of
Labour, a progressive tax on land values, realisation of an
adequate return from the unalienated public estate, the
abolition of State-aided immigration, the abolition of all
the conspiracy laws relating to industrial disputes, a
referendum or the submitting of measures for approval
or rejection to the people, a revision of the railway tariff,
the ousting of a member of Parliament on a two-chirds
majority adverse vote of his constituents, the exclusion
of the coloured, Asiatic and contract or indented labour ;
State construction and ownership of all railways; local
organisations to have a free hand on local matters,
including territorial separation ; and the fiscal question
not to be regarded as a labour-party question. Labour
candidates must be sober, and be pledged to vote for the
unconditional release of the union prisoners.
The above is, in most of its details, a good and
statesmanlike programme; the one conspicu-
ously weak point in it is the proposition that
local bodies should have a free hand in matters
of territorial separation. It is quite possible to
have a great deal too much territorial separa-
tion, and if all local bodies can start a process
of secession when they feel that way inclined
the time may come when Australia will have
two or three thousand separate Parliaments,
and nearly every able-bodied citizen will be a
member either of the Ministry or the Opposi-
tion. Also the proviso that Labour candidates
“ must be sober ” might as well be left out.
Surely the party isn’t so tar gone that it would
voluntarily select a candidate who was drunk 1
Premier Patterson’s yarn to his faithful army
at Castlemme was as void of real meaning as
the speeches of the men who had come to back
him up. It practically began and ended with
the worn-out assertion that the country must
put a “ shoulder to the wheel,” which figure of
speech was knocked awry when Bryan
O’Loghlen observed that the time had come
when they had to “sink all differences of
opinion and join shoulder to shoulder,” a
physical impossibility if they are all going to
shove at one wheel. But it was left for Gillies
to sound the lowest depth of oratorical drivel.
Duncan wound up his patriotic appeal with
these memorable words: “Expenditure for
a number of years was devoted to
public works, and if the people were
prepared to meet it there would be
very little difficulty. The country had to
meet it in a creditable manner, without saying
anything about the manner of doing it. He
did say that if a community such as this made
tip its mind that both ends were to be made to
meet , the money would certainly be provided.
They had to meet great obligations within a
short period, and if the people would show
themselves prepared to meet these obligations
in a reasonable way they would undoubtedly be
met," And this reminds us that when a thing
can be done and you mean to do it, there is no
difficulty in doing it, and as soon as you decide
to do it and have done it, the dashed thine is
a =
Blissful! A certain “ slang ” dictionary,
published in England, discourses on the word
“bloody.’’ This is described as an adjective of
common use in Australia, where it is employed to
express various shades of meaning, i.e., “It is a
-very hot day ” becomes, when AustraUsed, “It is
a ,” and so on.
Republicanism makes mighty strides.
Hawaii is a mere rushlight, but even the dousing
of this paltry glim is something gained. In Spain,
the thoroughness of Zorilla is displacing the com-
placent philosophy of that glorious windbag, Cas-
telar. Portugal has been a hotbed since Brazil
capitulated, and how is it the cableman now never
tells us that the Brazilian monarchy is sure to be
restored? Belgium ripens up, while the Pone
nails the tricolour of the French Republic to his
mast as the only sure thing in the tumbling ocean
waste of European politics.
N.S. W. Speaker Abbott was credited by
the local News last week with having said that he
intended to vote in the then pending close divi-
sion, instead of abstaining from voting, according
to custom. Mr. Abbott, however, afterwards told
someone that if he ever did say so, it was a joke.
Explaining in the House, he remarked that “if
the Evening News were an unreliable paper, he
would have taken no notice of the printed state-
ment. But it was a paper remarkable for its
veracity and its large circulation,” etc. Abbott
is evidently an incorrigible joker.
Speaking of “the dreary illiterature ” of
James Whitcomb Riley, the “ Hoosier ” poet,
thus that unique and incomparable Yankee master
of abusive English, Ambrose Bierce (hats off !)
His ignorance is as a tower looking toward Damascus,
and his notions of poetry are shouted out in every raucous
line that he writes. True, men cf sense do not, and men
of sensibility cannot, read what he writes; but if I rightly
understand his mission he was not sent upon men of sense
and sensibility, hut upon those who forgot God. In the
dirt of his “dialect” there is no grain of gold. His
pathos is bathos, his sentiment sediment, his “ homelv
philosophy” brute platitudes—beasts of the field of
thought. He preaches with an impediment in his preach.
His diction is without felicity, his vocabulary is not Eng-
lish, his—in short, Mr. Riley writes through his nose. “l
doubt not that Mr. Riley is an estimable gentleman—a
cheerful taxpayer, an orderly neighbour, a gifted house-
and-sign painter, a tender and affectionate bachelor,
and would worthily represent Hoop-pole county
in the hauls of legislation. If 1 could get his
respect without forfeiting mine I would rather have it
than his brains. But I am something sick of the pigno-
ramous crew of malinguists, cacophonologists, and apos-
trophographers who think they get close to nature by
depicting the sterile lives and limited emotions of the
gowks and sodhoppers that speak only to tangle their
tongues, and move only to fall over their own feet. To
this blessed blatherhood of illiterary bumpkins belongs,
also, that other pet o’ the people, Mr. Will Carleton, who
if God ever sees him will go over the hill to the poor-
house and stay there till death do him part. Another
member of the hideous confraternity is one Joel
Chandler Harris, who has so long obtained money
under false pretences by dragging an impossible old
nigger fabulist through the magazines that he
has worn all the black off him, But the reek
remains, a permanent heritage to popular literature.
Male and female created He them. Mary E. Wilkins fur-
nishes forth her weekly output of New-English antiques
and detestables, filing their teeth with their tongues, to
the inexpressible uncomforting of the auditory nerve.
Mary Murfree, in perpetual session on the Dejectable
Mountains, with a lapful of little tin clay-eaters and snuff-
rubbers, sweats great beads of blood to build the lofty
crime and endow it with enough galvanic vitality to stand
alone while she reaches for more mud for a new creation.
There follows an interminable tail of imitatresses, causing
two “dialects” to grow where but one grew before, and
rabbiting the literary preserve with a multiplication of
impossibles to speak them. And we forbid them not, for
of such is the thingdom of American letters.

“ The Times,” which was staged at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday night to the evident satis-
faction of a copious audience, may be said to be a
comedy of a new school. Every comedy has at
least one victim who is harassed by strange and
awful complications to make a theatrical holiday,
but in “The Times” the victim, and his wife and
daughter, and old woman Hooley who is his son’s
mother-in-law, and the elderly lady who drops in
occasionally, are all so utterly crushed by mis-
fortune that it is really impossible to decide
whether the piece is a comedy or a tragedy. Pro-
bably it is meant for a little of each. It is based
on the miseries of a wealthy and rising draper,
who has got into Parliament and is rapidly
making his way in society when his loutish
son marries an illiterate girl named Hooley,
and brings her and her mother into the
family. Then, in an evil hour, the draper
resolves to have the girl educated, and to
re-christen her with a name that sounds better
than Hooley, and, when she is sufficiently polished,
to have the marriage gone over again in state and
pass the Hooley off as an aristocrat. From that
moment his ruin begins. The lout gets drunk and
roars out the awful secret. The Irish bride gets
confidential and babbles away the family skeleton
to another girl. Old woman Hooley gets amorous
with a Home Rule member and informs him of
everything in strict confidence. The Home Rule
member compels the wretched draper to join
the Irish party as the price of his silence.
The girl tells her mother, who puts the
ghastly narrative in the papers. The draper’s
pretty wife is in tears for two whole
acts, and the draper, after a period of insensibility,
wakes up and goes off his head. The curtain
falls on the ashes of a happy home and the Home
Rule member dancing vindictively with an um-
brella amid the ruins. It is a new curtain, and,
in place of the hackneyed patch of water and a
gondola, there is depicted on it the vast interior
of a Moorish palace with a bare-footed dancing-
girl in the foreground, and sundry other attrac-
tions. The audience cheered it most deservedly
for seven minutes right ahead, till at last a blush-
ful and embarrassed gentleman came forward and

“The Times” is an artistic and well-
constructed play which has no noticeable weak
spots anywhere. It keeps going at full speed all
through. Messrs. Brough, as the miserable
draper, Ward, who plays the heavy and clownish
heir, and Boucicault, as the Home Rule member,
are all effective. Boucicault’s accent is the genuine
product of Tipperary, and no more distracted
draper than Brough ever raged on the boards. He
is a shade too distracted, in fact. Titheradge is
really brilliant as a faint, shambling gentleman
witli uncertain legs, who acts as a sort of mentor
and fashion-plate to the draper, and whose trea-
cherous limbs generally take him to the window
when he tries to run for the door. Mrs. Brough
has improved materially of late, and she and Miss
Maggie Moore —specially engaged as old woman
Hooley—are fully up to the high standard of the
new act-drop and the other fittings. The other
members of the company raise no homicidal
yearnings on the part of the audience. The moral
of “ The Times ” is either that the draper should
have belonged to the Irish party from the begin-
ning, or else that he should have thrown his sulky
cub and heir out on the pavement on the first day
of his honeymoon—but this point requires con-
sideration.

The Sydney Lyceum pantomime closes up
at the end of next week. Mr. Courtneidge takes a
benefit on Tuesday. Hudson’s Surprise Party
finishes up its career at the Garrick on Saturday,
and so far nothing new is announced to take its
place. Harry Rickards is still doing good busi-
ness at the Opera House, where he expects to keep
on for some time. On Sunday night a man went
into hysterics at Rickards’ establishment, and
after he had laughed for 27 consecutive minutes
he was removed on a charge of disturbance. When
a comedian has to drag his admirers out of the
house before the show can proceed, things may be
safely said to be booming.

The new combination at the unfortunate
Sydney Royal proposes to give up the struggle on
Friday. The unequal contest has lasted exactly a
fortnight, and the company has got the worst of
it. Even the exceeding thinness of “Uncles and
Aunts ” is not sufficient to account for the sudden-
ness of the fall—the Royal is evidently suffering
from a period of ill-luck, or the curse of Deeming
is upon it, or a murdered infant is crying for
Christian burial among the foundations, or some-
thing. On Saturday next, Messrs. Howe and
Baker open with “The World Against Her”—a
sensational drama which had a long run in Sydney
some years ago. A respectable company has been
engaged, and a great effort will be made to resur-
rect the Royal’s fallen fortunes.
** * *
“London Day by Day” has pursued its
garish way at Her Majesty’s (Sydney) for two
weeks with considerable encouragement from the
public. Every night George Rignold assaults the
wicked foreigner, and tears his accent amid
increasing popularity, and the midnight strangling
of Miss Kate Bishop by the same depraved out-
lander has evidently “caught on.” The only
question which remains unsettled in an otherwise
coherent and intelligent play is—who is the
wicked foreigner? The whole drama turns on
him. Whenever any murky crime is committed
the wicked foreigner is at the bat, and the Hebrew
money-lender is somewhere on deck helping him.
The foreigner himself claims to be George Rig-
nold’s elder brother who has been “ shook ” by an
unfeeling parent, but George’s father denies all
knowledge of him and flatly repudiates the alleged
relationship. Through four solid acts this person
wades from one crime to another because he
wants to drag down his usurping brother, and
then it transpires that he isn’t a brother or any
other relation. His frenzy is therefore a profound
mystery, right up to the time when he is arrested,
while whetting his tusks on his carpet-bag for
some new deed of berlud. Mr. Rignold owes the
public an explanation about this.

Miss May Habgood, of Hudson's Surprise
Party, whose portrait appears in this issue, is a
musician of considerable repute. She is also the
wife of “ Tommy ” Hudson. Miss Habgood
began her musical education at the age of five. In
her twelfth year she was nominated for the city
of London open scholarship connected with the
National Training School of Music. Of the fifty
competitors Miss May Habgood was the youngest,
yet she came out at the head of the list. She
forthwith entered college, and under Sir John
Stainer, the renowned organist of St. Paul’s Cathe-
dral, and Franklin Taylor, she worked hard for
several months, during which Sir Arthur Sullivan,
attracted by her talents, went somewhat out of
his way to further her musical education. A year
later she went on a tour through England, and
soon found herself in a position to command
engagements in London, Manchester, Birming-
ham, and other musical centres. Among other
public exhibitions, she was engaged to assist Sir
George Buckland in a series of musical lectures at
the Royal Polytech-
nic in London. She
accepted an engage-
me n t with Mr.
“Tommy” Hudson
in 1886, and that
year made her debut
before an Indian
audience. Some
time after this she
renewed her engage-
ment with the Sur-
prise Party, which
has now become par
manent.

A swimming car-
nival is to take place
on Saturday at Manly
(N.S.W.), for the
purpose of raising
funds to send yet
another Australian
to England in search
of a championship,
viz., Ernest Cavill,
who hopes to “ put
down ” the best swim-
mers of the old world.
A number of remark-
able performances are
on the programme,
and more things will
be done in the water
that day than are
dreamed of in the
dry man’s philosophy,
among them being
the rescue and resus-
citation of a drown-
ing man. The drown-
ing man will be Mr.
R. Adams Luckham,
of The Bulletin,
who will fall over-
board in full attire,
including hi s well-
known top-hat, at 5
o’clock precisely. A
proposition that Mr.
Luckham should
fall overboard in evening dress, as a compliment
to the ladies present, has been overruled.

Julius Herz, having left Melbourne fo r
Westralia to teach the gospel of music to the
natives of that region, young Ernest Wood, the
organist at St. Paul’s Cathedral, takes Herz’s
place as conductor of the Melbourne Metropolitan
Liedertafel. Once in a way the Cathedral choir
boys have sung at the Liedertafel concerts, and
given such samples of Woods’ training skill that
the vacant billet was offered to him with one
voice. If the new man aspires to work a revolu-
tion in Liedertafel chorus singing, he had better
buy a gun and start target practice on some of
the members. When a hundred men gather
together on a platform to warble, it is certain that
the forty poorest voices will take a fiendish delight
in producing more than their proper share of
noise. Now, the first duty of a conductor is to
put a bullet through the windpipe of each of these
men. “Your nightingale will sing no more. I
have shot him in the throat,” wired “Ouida’s”
Russian Prince to his wife, after a duel with
Correze. Evidently that is the place where many
amateur baritones and basses ought to be potted.

The pantomime at Melbourne Princess’s
has girded up its loins for the death struggle, and
evidently hopes to expire, a few days hence, in
the presence of a crowded house. The real
jocular ass is once more in evidence, also Snazelle
has opened out a small consignment of those fruity
“ gags ” with which society loves to bo shocked,
jn fact “The Forty Thieves” seems disposed to
a tone for the virtues of its gilded youth by a
giddy old age, a change of policy that suits the
country and tends to restore confidence in the
show. A few matrons may look pensive when the
infant Zetter warbles his intention to “chuck”
the missis, and give the barmaids all his kisses,
“ when he gets to be a man like Pa,” but the male
portion of the audience commend the ballad for
its candour. Last Saturday afternoon a snake-
charming exhibition was given by Mdlle. Sohera-
zade, the lady whosegracious smile paralysed Dibbs.
As with theN.S.W. Premier, so with the serpents.
They yielded to the influence of the charmer, and
gave her best. One of them was invited to squeeze
her waist, and did so; but the subjugation of
Dibbs never took this happy turn. On Saturday
evening a parody of the circus Hon performance
was introduced by Lonnen and Snazelle. _ The
gifted donkey-man, Hassan, scored again in his
new character of lion, the make-up being strikingly
funny. Apart from the humour of this animal
creation, however, the sketch was a weak-minded
affair, abounding in missed points and murdered
opportunities. It had been concocted on the pre-
mises, and somehow the purely stage conception
of satire seldom soars above rough-and-tumble
burlesque.

The Royal panto, finishes on Friday (10th)
night. Ada Bemister, for whose brief “ starring ”
visit the Melbourne stage is indebted to Mr.
Plain William Holloway, will return to Hingland
by the next Orient steamer, but other members of
the company, including the procession oi kings
and queens, intend to stand by Australia in its
hour of need and spend their seven weeks’ salary
on the soil. This is as it should be.

In connection with the farewell perform-
ance of “ Babes in the Wood ” comes an
announcement that “ Thousands of persons in
Victoria have never seen a British Farthing, as it
has lately represented one pound in value to the
extent of ,£235,991.” The Imperial spirit of
pSK,
MISS MAY HABGOOD, R.A.M.-(Hudson’s Surprise Party.)
George Coppin has long regarded this local ignor-
ance of Britain’s national coin and glorious symbol
of the Submerged Tenth with feelings of dismay.
Wherefore, the veteran benefactor proposes to let
every visitor not only see, but actually grab, a
farthing, and a new farthing at that, on the last
night of his “ historical and educational ” pageant.
In the earnest hope that a farthing still repre-
sents .£235,991, The Bulletin has made arrange-
ments to buy a ticket for Friday’s show, and
cash the souvenir in Vic. Treasury bonds.

Preparations for the Exhibition Baby
Show make satisfactory progress. An infant
virgin with a Sin. tail was originally entered as
a competitor, but the Exhibition trustees, having
studied the tail in all its bearings at a private
view, decided that it was unsuitable for publica-
tion. Meanwhile, an anxious Jewish parent sug-
gests that twins ought to be weighed in the
balance as one baby, and rewarded accordingly.
An intelligent gentleman, consisting
mainly of a head and one leg (the second leg
counting for very little) is writing a bold free
hand with his foot at Melbourne Waxworks.
This is a strange instance of how Nature may
seem cruel only to be kind. Thousands of able-
bodied men are reduced to pawning their boots
just now, whilst an afflicted brother who hasn’t
any body worth mentioning, can open a banking
account with his toes.

The rush for Fillis’ Circus has slightly
abated since the lions were licked back into dis-
cipline by trainer Cox, but business is still big. A
playful tiger out on the loose presents an unusual
appearance, anyway, and helps to keep the thrill
going. For the rest it must be admitted that this
Circus bears a strong family resemblance to the
rest of its kind. The one realty special feature of
Fillis’s brilliant jockey—misprinted “monkey”
in last issue—act is the rider’s cheery way of doing
what other men have accomplished in a more
serious mood. To be original Fillis would require
to dance on his horse’s ear. The Water Panto-
mime was to start on Wednesday, and the novelty
of this great damp festival is expected to fill the
tent to its utmost until the present season ter-
minates.

Maud Williamson is now giving lessons in
Elocution and Dramatic Art at the Hall of
Science, Fitzroy (Melb.), a fact which, when gener-
ally known, should bring a rush of aspirants to
the new academy. What Miss Williamson
doesn’t understand about her profession very few
living actresses are capable of teaching her, and
the dead ones don’t count, anyway. In “The
Pointsman ” she gave us a study of high-strung
womanhood that lives in the memory, and the fair
amateur in search of picturesque intensity may be
advised to sit at the feet of Maud Williamson
without delay.
At Poverty Point.
Fillis’s lions were running loose in a yard, at Hamburg,
when he bought them.
Bella Bashall doesn’t seem to Shine much at Melbourne
Royal—
He snorted at Bella,
And ventured to tell her,
Some things that he dared to opine ;
“ Rude fella,” said Bella,
“To hint that I’m mella—”
The rest was all Bella and Shine.
“ The light,” grumbled Bella,
“ Is ruddy or yella.
Don’t show up my dance Serpentine
“ Confusion and hella !”
Protested the fella,
“ There’s nothing apparent to Shine.”
Shine has since apologised.
Senseless advts. produce ridiculous notices. The Argus
says, “Mrs. Fillis, too, gave an artistic representation of
the haute icole ’’—simply that and nothing more. Put
haute icole into English, and what meaning does this
statement convey to the educated outsider?
Theatrical managers complain, with reason, that a
travelling circus gets a yard of fulsome free advt. for
every inch given to an expensive production at any of
the “ houses.” Moral: Get into the circus business.
A certain young lady being commendably anxious to have
a notice in The Bulletin, it is hereby certified that the
said young lady plays a part—a fairy, or something—in the
Melb. Princess’s pantomime. On second thoughts, we
consider that the part plays the lady. It is a very little
part and therefore doesn’t play her much.
Melba, writes The Bulletin’s London correspondent,
is very angry with some American newspaper for saying
that she failed to come up to expectations as a “ draw”
at Covent Garden lately. The bold, bad correspondent
asserted that, on the last occasion when she appeared, only
three stalls were sold. This is not accurate, but it is
undeniably true that she did not cram the house when
she sang. People are beginning to discover that, though
undoubtedly a fine singer, she is not yet a Patti or a Nils-
son, at all events as concerning the treasury. And, speak-
ing of Melba, reminds me' that it is said that Marches!
resents Melba’s insinuation that she did not learn much
from her, inasmuch as she was a “born singer.” Of
course, I don’t say that the Australian “diva” (as she is
called) ever said anything of the kind, but the statement
certainly appeared in print, and, no doubt, was brought to
Marchesi’s notice by some good-natured friend. At all
events, Marchesi is more than ever determined to boom
pretty Frances Saville, who, by the way, created quite a
furore in “Romeo et Juliette” at the Theatre de la
Monnaie in Brussels.
Ellen Terry w r as born in a greengrocery—at Coventry.
Melbourne Royal Panto, dies out first, and the hands
wonder what on earth they are to do.
“ I rub her spine with horse-fat, and it makes her
jump,” says the mother of a Parisian danseuse.
Dramateur is a new word.
Our young Melbourne friend, Harry Atkinson, “the
Australian Orpheus,” says The Bulletin’s London corres-
pondent, is still booming at the London music-halls. He
has just signed agreements extending to the end of 1896,
at a salary of £6O per week, to appear for six months in
each year at three halls—the Boy al, the Tivoli, and the
Pavilion. The other six months he will devote to provin-
cial work, for which he will receive even a higher salary.
He gets more money than the gieat Chevalier, but this
arises from the fact that “Chivvy” entered into his
engagements before the music-hall craze set in with such
intensity. Chevalier’s new engagements carry with
them a much higher salary—it is said £BO per week.
Besides this, it is estimated that he makes about £6O
monthly by royalties on sales of his songs.
The whistling man at Melbourne Royal is billed as Don
Garotto. The name doesn’t fit him badly.
The untamed Marshall Hall denies that Cowen had any
hand in putting him in the Melbourne Chair of Music,
and nobody cares whether Cowen was one of the culprits
or not. Sufficient that Marshall Hall is there and can’t
be avoided.
The company that supported Alfred Dampier most of
his time in Maoriland exercised a fatal influence on the
receipts. A full house to greet the Dampiers upon their
opening night in a, town would be followed by a wild
desire to avoid the rest of the company for ever.
Fillis was so anxious to preserve the Lion Act in his
show that he became rather too candid concerning the
docility of the beasts. His game should have been to
exaggerate their ferocity', and promise extraordinary pre-
cautions against another accident. For instance, why not
have ten men standing round the cage, each with a small
cannon pointed at Pasha, while the performance is going
on ? That's the sort of thing to excite the populace.
Australian gush-critics must feel flattered to hear that
Mrs. Beruard-Beere was a complete failure in New York,
where her season collapsed suddenly. The fact seems to
be that the spiritual barmaid class of drama is played out,
and Mrs. Beere is not seen at her best in any other.
The death of Fred. Leslie didn’t cause any of the
London papers to deplore the absence of Lonnen in Aus-
tralia. Artless folks on this side were disposed to imagine
that Hingland was shrieking for Lonnen to be brought
back at any cost to fill the gap, but it would seem that
there is a general apathy as to Lonnen in the land from
which he sprang.
Padded sells—the Gaiety girls’ legs.
MacMahon has been “exhibiting” in Ceylon a phono-
gram (taken in Australia) of the late Fred Leslie’s voice—
the well-known song “ Killaloe.”
“ Irving being ill, Holloway took this part.” How very
ill poor Irving must have been!
Plain Bill Holloway was apprenticed to, and served his
time with, a boiler-maker in Darling Harbour, Sydney.
“Charley” Holloway, his brother, is a bootmaker by
trade.
The Queen of Belgium and Princess Clementine were
present when Francis Saville last sang “Juliette” at
Brussels, and at the close of the play her Majesty sent
for the Australian singer and complimented her highly on
her finished performance, her brilliant voice, and charm-
ing appearance.
Conversation between two men just behind us in the pit
of the theatre. Bill: “ I see by the paper they ’ave at
Adelaide the biggest rhinoceros in the world, and Sells
wants to buy it.” “ But what is a rhinocerus,
Bill?” “I dunno; but I think it’s a cross between a
helephant and a ’oise, with a ’orn on its ’ead and a ’ell ot
a mouth.” B
A certain ex-treasurer of an Australian theatre will

Overheard from “behind” at one of the Sydney

The new act-drop for the Sydney Lyceum is being
painted by Phil. Goatcher, and will shortly replace Gor-
don’s Venetian scene, which is doing temporary duty at
the new house.
Frank Lincoln, the clever American monologue enter-
tainer, who came to Australia with Spalding’s baseballem,
is now in London coining money at fashionable at
homes.” He declares he is keeping away from America
to escape being nominated for the Presidency'.
Patlie Browne has really got that 12 months’ engage-
ment at the Court Theatre. She opens in “a rompmt,
part,” specially written for her by Pinero.
Sydney Star publishes a clipped interview with MfflG-
Bernhardt in Paris, as up to date, wherein Daniala, defunos
some years, is represented as being on the best of ter a'
with his famous Sarah. Perhaps he is, now that he
dead.
The cabled news of the marriage in England of an
actress who lately toured Australia, greatly interests® a
certain wealthy sharebroker well known in soutne

“1 nevir knew my old tamer, Carl Popper,, to get a
scratch during the five years that he was in my show,
before he married, at the Cape, a rich lady who thought he
was the bravest man in the world,” said Pillis to a Mel-
bourne paper man. “ Before he married!"
They wanted Boucicault to call the rebuilt Melbourne
Bijou the Phoenix. “ Fee-nix 1” said Boucy, “ that won’t

Captain Russell, of Fillis’ Circus, pleading tor free-trade
in lion-taming, argued that “ jockeys had been killed in
flat-racing and steeplechasing, yet we don’t find any out-
cry against the turf on the score of its risk to human
life.” Which sensible remark appeared in the same issue
of Melbourne Standard that reported the death of a
steeplechase jockey at Sandown Park races. While
Russell was nursing a scratched arm the other public
performer lay underneath his horse with his skull
crushed in.
Good-bye to the hoary fiction that a tame lion becomes
rampageous at the smell of human blood. Captain
Russell’s gore was flowing quite freely down his arm
before he had finished his show, at Melbourne, the other
Saturday— and he still lives. Perhaps the lions, like the
fox of the fable, had a bad cold and couldn’t smell.
Marie Brookes, now Mrs. T. B. Curran, junior, will be
remembered in Sydney as the big-limbed, Roman-nosed
woman who played the Corporal in “The Beggar
Student” with Braoy, at Sydney Opera House, about
three years ago. If we mistake not, she afterwards
travelled with Janet Achurch through Maoriland in
soubrette parts, and all at once disappeared mysteriously
from our theatrical horizon. She is some years older than
her Tom, a handsome hoy, who has not long attained his
majority. Papa Curran will be delighted when he arrives
in England.
The Wild-Cat Column.
The Melb. Commercial Bank directors take the
liberty of blaming “ men in the street,” “mischievous
alarmists,” &c., for what is apparently a cruel want of
confidence in the “ soundest ” financial institutions. This
sort of talk may be rapturously received by a meeting
that is about to draw a 12)- per cent, dividend, but the
men in the street are supported by history, all the same.
Melbourne banks have failed within a fortnight of paying
large dividends to shareholders, failed miserably in the
face of indignant official contradictions of all “ street ”
rumours. And what have the directors of the Commer-
cial, or any other Melbourne bank, done towards vindi-
cating the honour of their profession ? When the false-
hood of a dozen other balance-sheets was denounced, they
tcok no steps to make an example of the parties respon-
sible for the “lies,” and by reason of their public indif-
ference to “ cronk ” proceedings elsewhere they lost the
right to complain of any suspicions that fell upon their
own particular institutions. The cry for close enquiry
Into the conduct of bad banks is not heard from those
bankers who profess to be good, any more than the
character of Parliament as an institution seems to be a
matter of concern to such members as still have a char-
acter to lose. In Victoria just now it is an article of
public faith that no financiers or politicians are worth
swearing by. They have all mixed in very bad company,
and none of them were disgusted when they discovered
the fact.- It is useless for an important person with
responsible whiskers to get up and cry “ Shame! ” when
there is no shame left.

According to the cable, the Bank of England
authorities badly want to know’ —just as The Bulletin
did, and still does—why the Federal Bank found it neces-
sary to stop payment when it had—as its directors assert
—abundant assets to satisfy all its creditors in full.
Until the liquidation begins to give up its dead that query
isn’t at all likely to be answered. For an institution
which had long been earning 8 per cent, dividends, and
which had lost nothing of any consequence, to crumble
away like a house of dust, and sacrifice its capital and its
goodwill without calling up a jingle cent of the £400,000
available, passeth all understanding. The directors,
apparently, were resolved to do nothing, and they never
even gave the shareholders the option of doing anything
until after the suspension. Why a general meeting was
not called three days before, instead of three days after,
that fatal step wag taken remains an impervious mystery.
When once a bank suspends payment it is practically
lost, and a board which shuts up the business it was
appointed to manage without first giving the owners a
chance to save it is—well, it is the sort of board which
wants a lot of looking into.

S.A. branch of the Federal Bank was perfectly

In 14 months Melb. Tram Co. has reduced
employes who received £5OO a year 40 per cent. Seventy-
shillings-a-week men have been cut 30 per cent., and all
under 20 per cent., and it cannot be said they have
stopped yet. It looks as if the men would have to submit.
The condition of the rank and file gradually approaches
mere slavery.

Melbourne Tram Co.’s shares were down to 13s.
at the end of lust week.

In January, 1892, Melbourne Tram Co.’s mileage
was 728,238, and receipts £47,057. Last month, the
mileage was 738,832, and the receipts £39,178. For a
long time past, the revenue has been falling £2OO a week,
and the question of penny sections again c.omos up. The
directors, although stili firm in their refusal of this
sweeping reform, have knuckled down so far as to pro-
mise consideration of a system of twopenny fares. The
cabs will then gradually crumble under a penny tariff.

One of the numerous Sydney finance companies
stopped payment last week, and it is said that it intends to
ealli ts depositors together and ask for time. Things must
be at a pretty low ebb in Sydney business circles when a
company, whose business it is to finance for people in
monetary difficulties, has to make arrangements with its
own creditors. In view of the above, The Bulletin begs
to propose that people should now cease laughing at
“ Banker ” Friedman’s trouble.

The four official liquidators of the Commercial
Bank of S.A. have, up to now, received £lO,OOO remunera-
tion, and are paid at the rate of a guinea per hour. One
of them, “Honest Tom” Playford, has simultaneously

as director of companies, and a good income from a fruit
garden in the Mount Lofty Range.

The action brought by a certain mysterious City
Newspaper Co. to compel Melbourne Standard to amalga-
mate with the local Herald and Daily Telegraph (the
latter journal having already expired of general break-up
of the constitution) was ended as soon as it came seriously
before the court. In consideration of the Standard pay-
•ng £4OO to the practically unknown plaintiff the action
was withdrawn, each side squaring its own costs. Thus
died the last flickering spark of a once brilliant scheme
for working the oracle in the interests of “finance.” The
oddest of all features about this case was the apparent
want o f onnnecMnn hotivppii flip City Newspaper Co. that
“ bought" the Herald, and the Victorian Newspaper Co.
now engaged in running the same rag.

The Victorian Crown has decided that there is
not sufficient evidence to justify a criminal prosecution of
Sir Benjamin Benjamin and his co-directors of the Im-
perial Bank. “Certain facts have come out in the course
of the investigation, however, which show the necessity
of furlher inquiry with regard to the officers and
auditors.” This sounds highly uncomplimentary to the
business ability of the directors, or somewhat rough on
the auditors who passed their balance-sheets.

The Earl of Kilmorey, at the Wentworth
Proprietary meeting, in London, after exposing “the
little game that had been played at the Antipodes,” said
it was “the only unpleasant ingredient in the dish,” and
proceeded to enthuse over the present and future pros-
pects of the mine. To enthuse over the future of a
mine like the Wentworth is simply to take the chances of
being thought either an ass or a clairvoyant. The so-
called little game was simply that of unlucky or mis-
informed men who were prematurely enthusiastic. If the
Earl had said that more by good luck than anything else
the two mines were simultaneously working rich patches
of gold bigger than found heretofore (hut, nevertheless,
remembering their past, only patches), and expressed a
fervent hope that they would last, or that others would
be found, he would have played a safer game.

Charles Rasp, who is on the Adelaide register
of shareholders, drew £632 in Broken Hill dividends in
January. Mr. S. Beddome, ex-Police Magistrate at

Nearly every recognised Australian gold-field is
returning more gold, more dividends, and asking for less
calls. Here are a few Charters Towers dividends for last
year : Victory, £97,000 ; Day Dawn Block and Wyndham,
£50,000; Victoria, £41,000; Brilliant, £38,000; No. 7
North East Queen, £24,000; Mills United, £23,000. Yet in
the Sydney Exchanges there are perhaps not on an average
half-a-dozen daily sales in gold stock. In N.S.W., mining
shareholders are either asleep or stark, staring mad.
They are now in a dead sleep, and if to awake means
more boom madness, Heaven stop it. Better sleep on.

Mount Costigan mine (N.S.W.) again in diffi-
culties. After innumerable sanguine newspaper para-
graphs about the value of the ore and success of smelting
operations, the fact remains that the mine has not, as we
foreshadowed, paid working expenses.
* * *
The Lady Augusta mine, Eidsvold (Q.), recently
obtained 25000z5. of specimens. Eidsvold is, compara-
tively speaking, an untried field. The mining bugbear
(want of water) is the drawback. There are many mines
in Queensland that would pan out over 2ozs. of £3 10s.
gold if water for crushing could be obtained.

Only one man has called during the week with a
new gold-saving process. This has been a very dull week
for inventions. From all \ve could glean—for inventors
are very circumspect with regard to details—this will be
known as the kerosene process.

Mills’ Day Dawn United, Charters Towers, is
on the dividend-list—only 3d., it is true, but wuth its pon-
derous, unreasonable capital (£300,000) it requires £3750
to pay that. It comprises three leases with a total area
of 70 acres, intersected by numerous streets and lanes.
Leonard Redmond, M.D., late of the Towers, has a sultry
letter in London Mining Journal, to point out that the
plans distributed are misleading re the network of streets
and building-areas embraced by this property. Premier
Griffith recently visited the mine, as he always does when
in the district, and from the fact that he did not look in at
the Victory—a much richer, if not so big a mine-it is
assumed that he is “ in ” one and “not in ” the other.

The great improvement in the deeper ground of
the Ophir, True Blue Block and Caledonia mines,
Croydon, have largely helped to establish the permanence
of the field. In the Caledonia, after working the reef
down to 200 ft., a granite bar was met and the reef lost;
sinking on the same underlay was continued, and after
going 90ft. the reef again appeared, first only afoot thick,
but it was increased to five feet. And now the mine has
200 ft. on the new formation to stope out, and the reef is
reckoned at from two to three ozs.

Theo. Be van, formerly a New Guinea traveller,
who has written a book and a lot of other things, is now
a member of Hobart Stock Exchange. It will not be Mr.
B.’s fault if the local silver fields never boom again. In
his mining information circular he predicts that despite
Melbourne's fraudulence and the general “stoniness” of
Australia the Zeehan and Dundas silver-lead deposits will
be worth to Tasmania many a dozen Mt. Bischoffs, and
will lift this tight little island out of the mire. As a
thing is only worth what it fetches it is too cruel that in
the same circular he is obliged to quote Silver Queens
(once £9) at 7s. and Silver Streams at s)d.

“Old Jack the Digger” writes in a declamatory
tone that the Sunlight and West Sunlight, Hillgrove,
will be two permanent dividend-paying mines long after
the Baker’s Creek mine is worked out. The writer hopes
they will long before, because, in his opinion, the Baker’s
Creek is a long way from that time. His allegations
against tire management and big shareholders may be
true, and nothing but an enforced obedience to the libel-
law prevents their publication. If his very serious state-
ments are correct, publicity would mighty soon “stop
it,” while, if false, and therefore unjust, it would be a
very easy matter to prove their falsity. The writer can
here only advise the shareholders to enquire and consider
well before they sell their shares.

A Sunday paper tipster, in answering a corres-
pondent’s query, says he “only wishes all others were as
courteous.” The candour here unwittingly expressed is
admirable. But a word for the discourteous, not to say
insulting, correspondents. The man, for instance, who
purchased hundreds of Bonanza Consols on the tipster’s
advice at 125., and while waiting tor £1 saw them recede
to 65., and then was told of bea’S and all their schemes,
and again resolved to hold, and, while holding, saw them
down to Is., then Id., and finally liquidation and dissolu-
tion, isn’t likely to convey his sentiments in a courteous
letter. So, too, the buyers of Mount Boole Marvel,
Pambula, Butcher’s Reef, Mount Stewart, Central, Last
Call, and quite a number of other such stocks, probably
haven’t united and presented an illuminated address to
the tipster.

fhe writer is asked to state whether the average
wages of the Barrier miners are higher or lower since the
strike. He confesses he does not know-, and awaits
reliable information on the subject from persons on the
field. The Broken-hill authorities say the wages are just
as high ; but it is an ominous fact that, during the week,
the big mine has been struck by lightning.
[?]
84(5 Macquarie-street North, Sydney,
Bth February, 1893.
My Dear Moorabinda-
Suddenly as Governor Jetsey’s departure has
come upon official cognizance, it is whispered that
Lady Jersey has for long made no secret of her
intention to leave this impossible country in
March, and no secret either (to anybody not
actually purblind with vanity) of her want of cor-
dial admiration for the Australian and all his
works. The rather brainy Countess not having
been a gusher, there has really been no love lost
between society and Government House. Women
with privilege of entree, who were dying to be
individually a sister to Lady J., were received in
an arctic atmosphere of official punctilio, set
smiles and formal dialogue. “ I am here to receive
you and I am receiving you, so what more do you
want?” is hardly the right sort of impression for a
vice-regal lady to make if she wants to be wor-
shipped, and none of the pushing crowd have ever
got near enough to ask Lady Jersey what price
she gave for an opera-cloak—which was one of the
tumultuous experiences of poor harmless little,
dolly, ever-simpering Lady Carington.
This collapse of the “ Society ” house of cards
amuses me greatly. Don’t you remember when
the Jerseys were appointed, and rumours of their
exclusiveness and conservatism were whisked along
the cable, how Potts Point heaved a deep sigh of
contentment, and said it was a good thing—after
the Caringtons’ encouragement of mere Nobodies,
dontcherknow, that at last we were going to have
a man who would recognise who was who? And
after all the self-gratulations of Society, the
hurried withdrawal of the Jerseys for purely
social reasons, as it plainly appears, is a perfect
crusher for the gilded and aggressive crew ever
in the forefront of the “ pushers.”
This is my own opinion. If we must have
Governors, do let them be (pretended) Radicals for
peace sake. Conservatism takes a return ticket,
or sees the term out and turns Government House
into a hermitage. Haven’t we had proof of it ?
Contrast Gov. Loftus and Lord—and Lady—
Jersey with Hercules Robinson and “ Baron Bob.”
The recent tragic death by drowning of Mrs.
Edward Mort and Miss Dight at Bodalla (N.S.W.)
ought to have the effect of encouraging the dual-
bathing idea. The fact that one of the bathers
was saved by having a stick held out to her tends
to prove that had there been a man present, or
even within call, perhaps nobody would have been
drowned; but through the transparent modesty
of Mrs. Grundy, who despatches her most likely
rescuers miles in the opposite direction when a
swim is on the tanis, there is rarely a man within
coo-ee while a woman drowns.
Society, which has no objections to the scoop of
the ball bodice, draws a line at the possible revela-
tion of the high-necked sea-suit. But if bathing
must be made a sort of high priestesses’ mystic
gambol, the men of the party oughtn’t to be
banished further than the first turning where the
cry for help would reach them. Providing, of
course, that society doesn’t' prefer death to the
appearance of a man on the brink, like the punc-
tilious lady who objected to having her life saved
because she and her rescuer hadn’t been properly
introduced.
I wonder when such a tragic coincidence as the
deaths of Miss Helen and Miss Muriel Dight will
occur again? Two sisters, grown to womanhood
—very beautiful womanhood, in one instance —
met death accidentally, and almost simultane-
ously, although in widely-separated regions—the
one being drowned while bathing, the other killed
by a tiger-snake, which bit her foot as she was
stepping out of the bath. A weird thing is Fate.
Though Miss Muriel Dight, who had hardly left
the schoolroom, will not be so generally missed in
society as her sister, her sudden death is a source of
sorrow to many.
To an unprejudiced observer the Gosford A. and
H. Show was like every other show—with the
difference that the scenery in which the piize-
onion of the occasion was discovered was unusually
pretty - but the display of flowers, fruit, marma-
lade and macrame was a familiar impression—like
the groups of ladies round the buns and jam.
It is a blessed moment in the life of any she-show-
goer when she discovers unmistakeable arsenic in
the gas-green pickled gherkin of her bosom friend.
After the opening ceremonies a well-set luncheon,
with four ladies present thereat, was held at the
Royal Hotel.
I saw the Gosford amateurs in the local School
of Arts on Show-night, and although they hit on
the amateurs’old enemy, “Blow for Blow,” the
performance was saved by two people. Mrs. H.
Cox, as the virtuous twin heroine, was one of the
most satisfactory amateurs I have yet seen, from
her light make-up (the average sham-actress blinks
out at you through a sea of Indian ink) to her
subdued style and agreeable stage-presence. Mr.
H. Cox, as Charley Spraggs, was also a bright and
shining character who got up most professionally
and turned the rest of the men into broomsticks.
The play was well staged and mounted, and the
Gosford brass band obliged with an overture
which nearly blew the roof off.
In “The Times” —that fascinating stage illus-
tration of the beauty of every wheel keeping in its
own rut, at Sydney Criterion —Mrs. Brough
dresses Mrs. Egerton-Bompas much too well for a
draper’s spouse if the proverb rc shoemakers’ chil-
dren has a general trade application. Act 1
reveals Mrs. Brough in a bodice and train of rain-
bow brocade—the mauve hue predominant—over
a full front of cream veiling ; the sleeves gathered
and trimmed with an outer line of gold galon.
Emma Bronton wears a China-blue silk effectively
with gold fringes, forget-me-not bonnet.
In Act 2 Mrs. Brough wears ecru woollen with
brown velvet carmen jacket opening up the back,
the plain skirt finished with a velvet hem. The
third dress had a short directoire bodice and train
of shag-brown velvet —the train lined with faint
primrose silk; petticoat of ivory satin brocaded
in palm-leaves, and very effective sleevelets of
brown velvet, with an inner puff of ivory silk
matching the vest —diamond ornaments. The
last pathetic act is played in a sap-green moire
tea-gown with sleeves and full front of fine black
lace over green silk.
After Mrs. Brough’s refined-looking apparel,
Miss Homer’s fussy dressing as Miss Cazalet
and Maggie Moore’s necessary loudness as the
Widow Hooley were rather unbearable. Emma
Temple’s red gown was vulgar, too, but Miss T.
labours under the disadvantage of never looking
unladylike even under the most trying sartorial
circumstances. Brenda Gibson looked prettiest in
white silk—but Miss G. ought to distribute her
curly hair more carefully on top : the parting on
the first night reminded one of Lady Jane’s
lament. And the spectacle of Titheradge eating
cachous like a rabbit, and the miracle of Brough’s
get-up, added much to the “ all together.” The
gifted R.B. must have analysed a whole army of
calico jimmies before reaching such a pitch of
perfection.
The bust of Chief Justice Darley is the latest
source of trouble to a certain World’s Eair she-
comraittee. They had unanimously and voci-
ferously ordered it from the local Pygmalion (of
course without consulting the male portion of
the commission), but when the bill came in they,
the women, metaphorically fled in great disorder
and left one lady (or rather her husband) to pay
the piper. I have it on good, and, therefore, of
course, masculine authority, that the lady who
“ stood Sam ” will certainly be reimbursed.
And, after all the hubbub, the C.J.’s bust isn't
to be shown at Chicago, but is to be ordered right
back to Sydney again ! That this should be so is
another proof of the inefficiency of petticoat offi-
cials when anything national is on foot—for there
never was anything so ridiculous as this statuette
affair. It wasn’t authorised, it was very nearly
unpaid for, and as it was the work of a fresh-
caught clay-dabbler from ’Ome it wasn’t even Aus-
tralian ! And now the terra-cotta presentment of
N.S. Wales’leading Judge bangs about in goods-
sheds until its nose gets broken, or a vacant niche
turns up somewhere and wants filling.
That was an interesting elopement from the
Blue Mountains the other week —eight hundred a
year (and a girl thrown in) with a common,
ordinary fencer ! The heroine had a regular sheep-
dog of an aunt, too, who had strict orders to pre-
vent her charge having any communication what-
ever with the male sex. She wasn’t allowed to
take in the milk even—for fear the fatal fascina-
tions of the carter might lead to her being
entangled in his coat-collar by moonlight—and
her aunt never left her by day or by night until,
in a weak, unguarded moment, the she-avuncular
relative took a bath. In that brief interval the
niece fled with the fencer, and now there is one
well-rinsed but disconsolate female who doesn’t
intend to wash in the future without consulting
a fortune-teller.
The Jewish half of Sydney society is literally
on springs to know whether Lord Battersea is
coming to Government House or not —for if he
does the children of Israel will appear on the sur-
face of society doings like so many corks in a
pond. Lady Battersea is a daughter of Sir
Anthony de Rothschild —and as there never were
such clannish people as the Chosen, it isn’t likely
that Lady B. will entertain merely on the grass
folks who are probably the fifth cousins of her
grandmother. I will venture to bet that society
will become distinctly Semitic with Lady Batter-
sea’s arrival, and then there will be a charming
suggestion of harmoniousness if she gives three
balls in her season —won’t there?
The Duchess of Buckingham and Chandos made
her appearance at the recent Bong Bong—Bong
Tong—amateur races, at Mossvale. She is, I think,
the very first real live Duchess who has graced
this country, and the fashionable world was much
agog to see her. Her toilette was disappointing
in the extreme. She looked as if she had crawled
into a brown holland bag and then made it fast
round neck and waist. With her was Miss Woolf-
Murray, reputed to be a leading English beauty.
Governor Jersey was also at the races, keeping
very dark about his resignation. All the people
who profess to be bosom friends of his received a
severe knock when they saw in the next day’s
papers that he had resigned, and never told ’em a
word about it. It is now clear to everybody that he
never meant to stay the full five years, and
probably Her Grace The Duchess of Buckingham
and Chandos, Limited, had a little to do with
inducing Lady J. to hurry up and leave this
dismal country somewhat quicker than was
intended.
Mr. Tom Roberts and Mr. Strceton gave a
cheerful afternoon-tea, last Friday afternoon, at
their studio, 00 Pitt-street, Sydney. The studio
pictures were set off by the walls—draped, door
and all, with apple-green silk, which was charm-
ingly cool and just the right thing for a hot
climate —but hardly kind to pasty faces or flushed
ones. “Give us pink ! ” is the decorative cry of
every woman over 17.
A recent cable announces that the late Duke of
Marlborough has left Lady Colin Campbell a
legacy of .£20,000 to buy a mourning ring with.
Doubtful kindness, I should say, on the part of
any defunct duke to leave a five-figured remem-
brance to a lady who got through the divorce
court undivorced, with the duke as one of the in-
nocent co-respondents. Is the twenty thou, a
present for a good girl, or what ?
And talking about legacies somehow reminds
me that they say the reason why women don’t go
to funerals is that the men tell such good stories in
the coaches coming back !
Yours faithfully,
SAPPHO SMITH.

Mrs, Parkes and Emily Soldene listened

Said a well-known S. A. politician recently:

Parson Irwin, of
Carlton (Melb.), in a
sermon to young men,
the other Sunday, made
some touching allusions
to Henry Bai lees, and
exhorted the youths of
his congregation to fol-
low in the footsteps of
that righteous and God-
fearing man, who, he
said, started life as a
labourer with a wage
of £1 a week and a
soul full of divine
grace, and who, by
diligently serving the
Lord, rose to great
eminence and won uni-

Argus “ Vanity-Fair ” scribe, on Lady

One reason why L. L. Smith, £.£., of

A Sydney barrister, now in good practice,

“Lord Burford” arrived in Sydney the

For years past we have discovered a new British

Bishop Webber (Q.) is being chastened by
the visible fear of immediate poverty. His salary
is £1250 a year, but the Synod can only raise
about £lOOO, and is getting into debt. The
Bishop now seems to be threatened with a reduc-
tion of salary. This should induce resignation—
Christian resignation.
Rev. G. E. Rowe, who poses as the most
radical of S.A. parsons, owes all the social success
of his recent visit to England to letters of intro-
duction given him by Gov. Kintore. In return
be has —by means of lectures and dissolving views
been booming Kintore’s picnic trip from Port
Darwin overland to Adelaide.
The Argus, in a sub-leader, draws a
social distinction between Mr. J. E. Barrett and
the other Australian Eleven men, who are just
plain Bruce, Giffen, Trumble, &o. A few weeks
ago Mr. J, E. Barrett married money in the shape
of the sister of the once famous “girl-boy.” It is
wildly reported that the happy bride settled
£15,000 on her hero.
When N.S.W. Assembly divided on
Parkes’ motion of censure in the small hours of
the morning and the haggard legislators started
for homo, after a 33 hours’ sitting, a Sydney D.T.
reporter was waiting for Premier Dibbs on the
front steps, and wanted to know what the Go-
vernment proposed to do. “The Government,”
said Dibbs frankly, “is going to bed.”
'1 he expected rencontre of Chief Justice
Madden and Judge Williams drew a crowd to the
legal opening day, in the Melbourne courts, but it
was arranged so that they did not meet. Isaacs, as
Solicitor-General, was, in fact, the hero of the day,
first with an oration on Higinbotham, before all
the Judges except Madden, and then with another
before Madden, without the other Judges.
Queen Victoria, according to ex-Agent-
General Munro, though she uses liquor, insists
on her new bagpiper being a teetotaller. In
other words, Victoria isn’t teetotal herself, and
the bagpiper will probably drink on the sly and
tell lies about it. “ Bogpeeps and soda-watter !”
Very likely, isn’t it? Yet the smileless James
actually quotes this as an evidence of the rapid
growth of total abstinence.
Detective Considine intends to retire from
the Victorian police service. His reasons are said
to be of a private and satisfactory nature, but the
Bulletin prefers to stick to its curse-of-Deetning
theory. Deeming breathed on Considine when he
was “took,” and the career of that intelligent
officer was blighted. Considine, it seems, was
“ more or less instrumental in securing 10 death-
sentences,” so, of course, ho deserves well of his
country.
A BLOWN WARRIOR.

Explorer Lindsay’s journals, which have
been heavily expurgated because of the many
personal references they contained, are now in the
hands of the S. A, Government-printer, while the
plans to illustrate the volume have already been
lithographed by the Surveyor-General. Lindsay
threatens to publish in a supplementary volume
all the matter which the local branch of the
Geographical Society has suppressed. Ho is
pious, and preaches on occasion, but is by no
means meek and lowly.
Fred. Miller, who kept the restaurant in
King-street, Sydney, adjoining the A.J.S. Bank,
is dead. He was at one time cook to “Dr.”
Barton, of the John Bull Tavern, Little Collins-
street, Melbourne. The house in which Miller
died has a history. It was built in 1842 by Mrs,
Headley, who in 1845 was found murdered in her
bed; her slayer was never discovered, lb was
afterwards tenanted by a gunsmith, who, while
standing in his doorway was shot dead for some
fancied insult by an acquaintance, and a couple of
years ago an attendant at the restaurant went up-
stairs and committed suicide.
Wolfe’s Schnapps—£l orders.
Advertising Apothecary £ £ Smith (who
is already having majestic inscriptions put upon
his trunks in a Melbourne painter’s shop), may,
when he represents Victoria at the opening of the
Imperial Institute, in May next, in a frilled shirt
with diamond studs, induce Queen Victoria to
put up a women’s tng-of-war as a pleasing change
in the opening programme ; in any case he maybe
relied upon to give the great British public some
idea of what a gentleman, who is also a physician,
is. The late estimable Beaney had a good time in
Bull-land, but £ £ should go one better—if duly
advertised and properly knighted.
Francis Longmore, Minister for Railways
in the Black Wednesday Govt., is again before
the Victorian political footlights. He has been a
consistent Liberal, but the most portentous bore
ever heard in a Legislature which has listened to
Wrixon and O’Loglden. Longmore has altered
out of all knowledge since his Parliamentary days,
and is quite white. He has been doing well as a

skirts they almost are—
and his matrimonial
arrangements are said to
have been delayed for
some months owing to
the old mistake of put-
ting the wrong letters
into the right envelopes,
or vice versa.
Rev. Wollaston, of
Trinity Church, East
Melbourne, has married
the sister of his son’s
wife. Query. What re-
lation is the son to the
old gentleman ?
“Jay Gould’s face,” said an American
writer once, “ wore a permanent expression of
pain and his eyes were homes of trouble.
Another man wrote of him years ago ; “I noticed
that a little man with a big head evidently shared
mv disposition, and mutual curiosity brought us
together. The man was Jay Gould, and his
cynicism fairly converted me, for no man could be
long in his company and compete with him m
cruelty of expression and callousness of thought.
He was the hardest man I ever met.” Goulds
description of himself was condensed into a sen-
tence : “I am the most miserable devil in the
whole world.”
Not much fear of the poor Queensland
planter throwing up the sponge on the ground that
cane cultivation doesn’t pay him. Listen. Cran
Brothers, of Dunoraggan (Bnndaberg), have leased
an adjoining area for a number of years at £3
per acre per annum. The rate paid for cutting
will be not more than £2 10s. per acre. This
shows what the- fictitious value of rent means.
The crop is only worth so much, and when exorbi-
tant rents are paid profit can only be made by
docking at the other end, in other words reducing
the price of labour. The land-question—ever the
land-question.
A man who has just finished a long term
of imprisonment in Maoriland on a charge of
sheep-stealing is appealing to Parliament for
redress. His petition sets forth that he was prose-
cuted by a wealthy financial co. with which ho
had long been on bad terms ; that the lawyers
who prosecuted were the said co.’s solicitors ; that
the sheriff who summoned the jury was the co.’s
auditor ; that the Judge who tried the case had a
big overdraft with the co.; and that the chief wit-
ness for the prosecution was paid ,£5O travelling
and other expenses by the co. If these assertions
can be verified there should be quite a lot of trou-
ble ahead for several people.
Why doesn’t the vote-for-thrift man carry
out his idea to its logical extension? That is,
why doesn’t ho demand not only an extra vote for
thrift, but an extra representative for thrift ? For
instance, why doesn’t he demand that East Mel-
bourne, East Sydney, and other wealthy con-
stituencies, which are rated for municipal pur-
poses twenty times as highly as some of the
suburban and country constituencies, should
return twenty members of Parliament to every
one of the others mentioned ? If he who exercises
“thrift”—f.c., gets wealth —ought to have an
extra vote, surely the wealthy (thrifty) electoral
district should have an extra member.
Sydney Sunday Times (“The People’s
Watchdog!”) gravely suggests (in a leading article)
that anybody who wants one ora hundred plural
votes in Australia should Im/i them right out by
the payment of .£5O or ,£lOO to the Treasury for
each vote. Just so. And why not let everybody
who wants a seat in Parliament buy it right out by
paying £lO,OOO to the Treasury ? Also, why
shouldn’t anyone get a Ministerial portfolio, ora
title, or a Civil service billvt by paying for it at a
fixed tariff? And what’s the matter with letting
anyone have a legal decision in his favour by
putting down the cash? In fact, why not sell
everything, if it comes to that, and have a big
surplus in the Treasury ?
As a hair dressing and renovator, Ayer’s Hair
Vigor is universally commended. It eradicates
dandruff, cures eruptions of the scalp, invigorates
and beautifies the hair and prevents its fading or
turning grav.
The Dibbs Administration were saved from
a defeat by their clever tactics in delaying the
division in the Council on the Thrift vote. Dick
O’Connor, M.L.C., talked against time to good
purpose. He staved off the rejection of one-man-
one-vote pending the debate on Parkes’s motion
of censure. Several Labour members declined to
give a vote which would bring about a dissolution
until one-man-one-vote was won, knowing, how-
ever, that the Council had affirmed the principle
of a property vote by giving the franchise to
pastoral leases of the value of £lO.
Panton, the Melb. “loyal” beak, never
wearies of impressing upon degraded foreigners
the fact that when they are in Australia they
must do as the Hinglish do. Last week he found
his opportunity in the case of an “ unnaturalised ”
Russian Finn, charged with Republican senti-
ments and insulting behaviour to the police. It
if incredible to Panton that Britons (born in
Australia) could allow a Finn to air his eloquence
outside of Finland. The country doesn’t require
OUR NEW WINDLASS-HAND.
VOICE FROM BELOW : “Hi, Mike, send down a ‘soldier and cap.’”
NEWCHUM : “Gerront, there’s divil a soljer widin fifty modes of this
place. Will M'Giunis, the polaceman, do?"
such persons, and Panton, it seems,fhas made up
his mind that every description of unnaturalised
alien, except Chinamen and black hawkers, must
bo snorted off the fair face of this continent.
Specially Americans. Panton disapproves of
Americans to a terrible extent.
Australian politics nowadays are a trial of
physical endurance. During the N.S.W. censure
debate Dibbs kept his seat almost continuously
for 30 hours, merely going out now and then to
get some refreshment, or to put on a»clean collar.
Only a man who can do without sleep indefinitely
is fit fo be Premier in N.S. Wales. The strength
of the Dibbs-Barton Cabinet lies in the fact that
its two chiefs can camp on the front bench with
the persistence of a brass god on a pedestal,
and never grow weary though the debate may last
till the resurrection. Toby Barton can go to sleep
at will at any time or in any place ; lie can nod
for five minutes and awake with another hour’s
fight in him. Reid hasn’t muscle enough for the
position, and Parkes’s massive frame is fast break-
ing down.
M'Culloch, whose sudden death in Eng-
land, at the age of 74, is cabled, was a trans-
parent man. He went baldheaded for the winning
side, though, as often happens, he ruined him-
self by mistaking it, in calculating the re-
action ; with Scotch cunning, he meant to lead the
ebb as well as the flow of the tide. Personally, ho
was not loveable —had in him nothing of that
geniality which gained affection for the equally
slippery Blaine. M'Culloch was naught but
sordid, and anyone can see now that Higinbotham
was the only real factor of the time. The turning
point in M’Culloch’s career may be perceived in
his second marriage, with Miss Inglis, a middle-
aged lady, who came out for the purpose, and was
connected with the Dennistouns. M'Culloch was
a widower during the time that he waged the war
of 1864-9.
For h Hepatitis. Dr. Fletcher’s Pills are a
sure cure for biliousness and liver complaints,
htepatitis, headache, indigestion, heartburn, kid-
ney ailments, and females’ sick headaches.
So, if you want a really good family pill, try
Dr. Fletcher’s Pills, the silent and painless motor
that purifies the human system of all accumu-
lations or morbid, foreign, and poisonous secre-
tions.
They arc as mild as a pet lamb, as harmless as
honey, as searching as a small tooth comb, and as
sure as a spring gun. They don’t go fooling
around, but attend strictly to business, and never
labour in vain.
Dr. Fletcher’s Pills are prepared on scientific
principles. They contain no aloes, calomel, or
gamboge, or any drastic purgative, like most pills
now sold to a confiding public, but are made of
pure vegetable ingredients, which act by gently
stimulating the liver and softening the impacted
faeces, thereby giving relief and comfort un-
attended by the annoyance and pain of griping
and purging, and are confidently recommended to
all persons of a sluggish or bilious temperament.
They are sold everywhere, or post free, thirteen
stamps, from h'. I\l. CLEMENTS, Newtown,
New South Wales.
A popular amusement in Melbourne just
now is for two men to sneak up behind a “sus-
pect” in a bar, or elsewhere, and commence a con-
versation in which one mentions casually that the
mace has been discovered. Then they watch his
check blanch and the cold perspiration trickle
down his jaw.

Only three members of the new Victorian
Cabinet have previously held Ministerial office.
One thousand six hundred and forty-three
non-residents of N.S. Wales are yearly put on the
electoral roll.
To Mr. Frank Cotton, M.P., must chiefly
be ascribed the disintegration of the N.S.W.
Labour-party.
That gilded patriot, the Hon. William
Pearson, was the lowest tenderer for Victorian
Treasury Bonds.
See Avhat mere figureheads Australian
Governors are. They can cut painter, for Maori-
land or England, at the most momentous crises.
Toby Barton is admitted to be the political
Atlas of N.S.W. He bosses the Administration,
runs the Speaker and Chairman, and befools the
Parliament.
S.A. has no shorthand staff, and during
the present Parliament private stenographers have
drawn £6208 16s. lid. for Commissions and com-
mittee-reporting.
John Burns : “ Party Government is a
pantomime picture, intended to divert attention
from the great, ghastly, social tragedy going on
behind the scenes. ”
“Where is our leader?” This is the
plaintive cry of the S.A. democratic party. Un-
happily, he lies under the turf at Payneham
(S.A.) —Hugh Gilmore.
Premier Patterson recalls Chancellor
Calonne, when Marie Antoinette wanted money.
“Madame, if it be only difficult, it is done; if it
is impossible, it shall be done.”
Autocrat Dibbs: “Any person who ac-
cepts GoverHment employment is expected, so far
as the conduct of the Government is concerned, to
keep his tongue within his teeth.”
A Labour-party without a leader is like a
waggon without a king-bolt. No matter how
good the component parts, it must inevitably
collapse at the first move onwards.
Bull by Andy Kelly, M.P. :
Mr. Kelly; “Itis my unfortunate position that I have
no fortune!” Mr. J. M. Toohey: “AVhatever fortune I
have I made myself.” Mr. Kelly : “So did I! ”
Frank Cotton, M.L.A. (N.S.W.), says
that an English clergyman, some 60 years ago,
invested £l7 in N.S.W. land, and when he died
the other day the estate realised £55,000.
Levien, M.P., says some politicians remind
him of the Irishman who, asked for his address,
replied, “No. 2 arch, Dublin Bridge. When the
tide’s in I’m out, when I’m in the tide’s out.”
There is a general impression in Maoriland,
just now, that an Education Board which charges
its own private barrel of beer as “ school material ”
is running things into the ground, in a manner of
speaking.
S.A. National “Ass” agents are already
appointed in certain districts to win support for
the Downer Ministry. And yet Downer pretends
that he is going to place a democratic programme
before the people !
Melbourne Standard announces that it
has named the new Vic. Premier “Backbone”
Patterson. The Bulletin will lay odds on
“Backdown” Patterson when it comes to fighting
with a majority of three.
On his own admission, J[ohu Lucas,
M.L.C., voted at last N.S.W. election for 24 candi-
dates, at the Glebe, Redfern, Newtown, Canter-
bury, Mudgee and Penrith. He says that he
wants to lose the privilege.

idea is to give away somebody else’s last shilling.
Parkes and Barton have finally separated,
and the great cause of Himperial Federation is
cooked unless And that is possible. Barton
said even more severe things of Dibbs ere ho
joined him. All things are possible to politicians.
Robert Reid is the second Victorian softgoods
Minister of Defence. However, Sargood’s ap-
pointment possessed an element of justification,
inasmuch as he was always a military enthusiast,
while Reid doesn’t know “ a Chassepot rifle from
a javelin.”
The U.S. Congress—so the cable asserts —
is considering a bill authorising the Government
to annex Canada whenever Great Britain consents.
Later on the bill will probably be amended to pro-
vide that Canada may be annexed whether Britain
consents or not.
G, H. Reid (just defeated after his fourth
desperate attempt—within 12 months—to grab at
office in N.S.W.) : “I consider the division is only
another proof of the continual public calamity
arising from the persistent desire of the Govern-
ment to retain office.”
Ministers of the Crown and members of
Parliament (bI.S.W.) recently submitted to a
voluntary reduction of 5 per cent, in their screws;
but on the next pay-day they looted the State
Treasury of every penny of the remuneration to
which they were by law entitled.
Sydney Daily Telegraph wants to know,
“ Whether the (N.S.W.) Government will con-
sidcr themselves entitled to retain office by virtue
of a majority of three?” That indignant organ
thinks they should resign in favour of the party
which has a minority of three, we presume.
S.A. Labour-party is accused of putting
the cart before the horse by selecting candi-
dates for the April elections, when a policy has
not yet even been settled. Further, it is urged
that the “wage-earner” restriction has shutout
some of the ablest of the local democrats.
The unblushing “face” with which the
Vic. Legislature proclaims its own purity is a
sufficient condemnation of the gang. Patterson,
at Castlemaine, couldn’t resist the chance of howl-
ing forth with the injured innocence air of a bank-
director : “During my long experience of Parlia-
mentary life I have never known anything done
of a dishonourable character, and no body of men
in any other walk of life can hold their heads
higher.” Virtue, thy sign in chemistrv is
M.L.A.! " ,
Speaking of the
N. S. W. Labour-party,
Sydney Sunday Times
describes it as “ a party
whose members, elected
to the Legislature of
this country by the
votes and voices of the
masses—by the people
and for the people—no
sooner found themselves
in a position that, in
nine cases out of ten,
neither God nor nature
ever intended them for,
than they hastened to
sell all they had to
the highest bidder.”
This statement may be
put down in few words
as a lie, whose existence
has no excuse except in
the mind of the disap-
pointed jackal who
penned it.
Fred. Flowers, the
Labour candidate for
N.S.W. Parliament in
room of J. M. Toohey,
resigned, says he’ll do
more when he gets in
than all the other mem-
bers put together.
Which means either
that the Labour-party’s
strength will be in-
creased to 66 or else
that it will be two
strong in Flowers and
the 33 that it takes to
furnish a man equal to
him. But it is to be
hoped that, despite
such injudicious brag-
gadocio, Flowers will
be returned as an evi-
dence that the workers
have not lost faith in
parliamentary me-
thods.
J. B. Patterson, as a shrinker of the Vic.
Public Service, is good. It is not long since he
was taunted in the ’Ouse with having, years ago,
done his best to depopulate Oastlemaine by
shovelling his constituents, together with their
sisters, cousins, and aunts, into Government
billets.
Barton declines to associate any longer
with Parkes in fighting the cause of Imperial
Federation. The Common-Link Bill is practically
a “slaughtered innocent ” in the present N.S.W.
Parliament. In the event of the House being dis-
solved. the new House must begin de novo with
the Bill.
J. H. Symon, Q.C. (S.A.), says “God
save the Queen ” without Bible-reading in State-
schools becomes “ a meaningless melody.”
“ Shifting his side as a lawyer knows how,” he also
argues that the banishment of the Bible from
State-schools should be followed by the abolition
of oaths in courts of Justice.
The usual pious crank writes to Sydney
D.T. pointing out that an income-tax would lead
to falsifying of returns and perjury, and should
therefore be opposed by the religious classes.
How does a man expect to get to Heaven by the
aid of a religion that isn’t strong enough to pre-
vent him perjuring himself on his income-tax
schedule ?
William Rolleston, leader of the Maori-
land Opposition, says that Premier Ballauoe’s
action in calling 12 democrats to the Upper House
is a precedent which will destroy “constitutional-
ism ” in Maoriland, and “ prove the death-knell
of a nominated Legislative Council.” This is the
best news that Maoriland has heard for quite a
king time.
The Queensland Treasury artistically re-
presents its revenue for the latter half of ’92,
which is the first half of the current politico-
financial year of that province, as having increased,
over the revenue for the last half of ’9l, by
£65,089. From which please deduct £50,000,
receipts from “special sales” of land at give-
away prices.
Duncan Gillies says that “if they (the
Victorians) had only done justice to themselves
they would never have had the carping, dis-
honourable, and outrageous criticism they had
experienced, not only in Victoria, but in the old
world.” The Bulletin’s sentiments exactly.
The mistake that so many public men made was
in not sending themselves to gaol as a guarantee
of good faith.
A landholder at Donald (Vic.) claims
£2OOO from Government on account of If acres of
land taken for railway purposes. He owns 320
acres, and paid £lOOO for the lot three years ago.
The railway adds at least another £lOOO to its
value. And he only wants £2OOO more for less
than two acres. A cast-iron betterment law would
fit cases like this to perfection.
N.S.W. Opposition leader Reid, M.P.,
now pompously speaks of “a public” newspaper
—as if there were such things as private news-
papers. Such phrases are evidences of the Parkes
disease—the chief obvious symptoms of which are
flatulence and mouthing. People afflicted with
this complaint never find out for themselves any-
thing that appears in a newspaper, but always
“ have their attention directed ” to it.
Dear Bulletin, —Concerning the con-
troversy now raging as to the powers and duties
of the N.S.W. Minister of Lands in terminating
the leases in the Central division. You may make
your mind easy in that not 50 per cent, of the
Central lessees will ever apply for an extension,
and of those who do apply not 50 per cent, will
get it. So that, in reality, the leases will drop
in from year to year. Experto crede. —M.R. A.
London papers solemnly remind Glad-
stone that Australia will not brook the domination
of the United States at Hawaii. Any stick to

FIRST BUSINESS, THEN PLEASURE.
THE OLD LADY: “Three-penn’orth o’ rum, please, Miss. But,
please, would you gimme a drink o’ water first —I’m thirsty.”
Country ” know or care about Australia’s sym-
pathies. We welcome Uncle Sam as a neighbour.
He, at least, is a man of peace. The virtual
annexation of Hawaii by Yankecland is a step
towards the union of the great English-speaking
races. Yah !
The Utopian expedition from Australia to
Paraguay is being run on straight communal
lines. Don Lane tells the rank and file of the
departing crowd to vote yea or nay his own nomi-
nation to the chairmanship of the “association,”
without going through, the formality of putting
anybody else’s name down for the billet—one way
of bossing the concern without seeming to do
so. The Heads, McNaught and Cummings,
apparently don’t count.
Some of the “purchases” made by the
holy protectors of “ignorant and unsuspecting”
natives in the New Hebrides, have been brought
under the notice of the Governor of Fiji, by the
naval officers commanding ships that have visited
the syndicate’s preserves: 4600 acres wore
“ bought ” for £40195. 2d,; 2300 for £l6lBs. lOd.;
3500 for £57 10s. 4d.; 3200 for £3O; 8000 for £45;
in all, 21,600 acres for £l9O Bs. 4d., the average
cost being per acre!
The moral of M‘Culloch’s life is that the
Victorian Tories have won all along the line.
Whether his treachery be the cause is another
question. Here is the Legislative Council, resting
on its property representation, as of equal elec-
toral value with the Assembly. Higmbotham
and Berry successively flung up the sponge in
trying to prevent it. Let the Victorian example
be pondered well by N.S.W. A civil war would
bo cheaper than an Upper House of the Victorian
fashion.
Veteran Longmore, opposing Patterson
at Castlemaine (Vie.), fulminated against the real-
estate monopolists, instancing the Ohirnsides and
Soapy Wilson as giant grabbers. Melbourne
Standard, the journalistic poodle of all big men
and bloated institutions, exultantly announces
that Longmore holds a selection of 300 acres him-
self, and that several of his relatives are also
working selections. The insensate jewspaper
regards this as an answer to Longmore’s outcry
against the mammoth squatters.
Referring to Speaker Joseph Abbott’s
statement—evoked by an Evening News par.—
that he would not vote for the Government when
its existence was challenged in Committee,
because his so doing “would stamp him as a par-
tisan S.M. Herald, applauding, declares that
the Chairman of Committees should follow a
similar course. Possibly, but the inevitable logic
of Abbott’s position, and the Herald’s deduction
from it, is that both positions should be held by
mere officials and not by representatives of the
people.
Parkes’ denunciation of Dibbs’ hap-
hazard retrenchment policy comes with singularly*
gross taste from the man who, in 1887, approved of
a scheme, never pressed to a vote, to save <£56,000
on the salaries of the Civil service, and who, in
1889, carried a host of increases for the higher-paid
officials, which Dibbs estimated at the time at
£150,000, Instead of retrenching 5 per cent, all
round in order to save £20,000, why has not Dibbs
the moral pluck to knock off the unwarrantable in-
increases of 1889, and reduce his deficit by
£150,000 ?
M'Culloch and Berry—what a hatred !
M'Culloch saw all along that Berry was a
genuine believer in what he (M‘Culloch) only
affected to believe, and Berry saw through him.
So Berry was shelved in all M'Culloch’s com-
binations, but “the run-down dingo” doubled.
The writer will never forget the sight of M‘Cul-
loch, with his nine supporters, facing Berry, in
the Assembly, after the triumph of ’77. He was
turned into the dingo, with its tail between its
legs. It is amazing how the successful calculator
of 1864 could miscalculate so.
Parkes’ new-born zeal to repeal or amend
old and obsolete laws was a profligate bid for the'
votes of light-headed Labour members. His pro-
fessions of a desire to repeal the conspiracy laws
fell very flat. In 1890, when the Sydney Freetrade
papers were likely to be mulct in penalties to the
amount of £40,000 for the offence of announcing
Sunday entertainments, Parkes rushed to their aid
with a bill to amend an obsolete law ; and the bill
was equivalent to a subsidy of £40,000 to the Press
of the capitalistic party. But whenever Labour-
member Laugwell tried to get at his bill to repeal
the Conspiracy Laws he was blocked by Parkes.
You can see any day in the streets of any
city men who look damaged—men, too, of good
original material, who started out in life with
generous aspirations. Once it was said that they
were bright, promising lads ; once they looked
happily into the faces of mothers whose daily
breath was a prayer for their purity and peace.
Going to the bad ! The spell of evil companion-
ship; the willingness to hold and use money not
honestly gained ; the stealthy, seductive, plausible
advance of the appetite for strong drink; the
treacherous fascination of the gambling table ;
the gradual loss of interest in business and in
things which build a man up ; the rapid weaken-,
ing of the whole body ; a depletion of the general
strength and vitality; the struggle for existence
and the worry and turmoil of life breaks lip the
vital strength and hurries many a man into an
untimely grave. First symptoms are numerous—
headache, nervousness, failure of appetite and
indigestion, and various other signs. All are
forerunners of some impending serious physical
complication. Recourse had to a rational me-
dicament such as Clements Tonic always removes
all signs of disease, restores the action of every
impaired organ, increases the appetite and aids
digestion, thus ensuring a healthy organism, and
granting the afflicted a new lease of life.
Sceptics may scoff and doubt, but when local
evidence is given it must prove the truth, no
matter how biassed a mind may be; for instance,
Captain P. Connelly, 20 Elliott-street, Balmain,
Sydney, New South Wales, who writes :—Three
months ago my wife, 55 years of age, was confined
to her bed, unable to move. I called in Dr. -,
of Balmain, who pronounced the case as hopeless,
and beyond all human skill, it being a general
breaking-up of the system. He further told me
she was in a high state of fever (what kind he did
not state). Her temperature was 105. She was
quite unconscious, and apparently not far from
her end. She remained under his treatment for
about ten days, during which time she took the
medicine he prescribed without the least improve-
ment. On his third visit he again pronounced the
case as hopeless, and told me to give no medicine,
but plenty of nourishment, and if I liked I could
call in another medical man. I could see my wife
rapidly sinking, and having heard of Clements
Tonic, I determined to try it. I purchased a
bottle from Mr. , chemist, of Balmain.
When the doctor paid his fourth visit I had given
her three doses, and noticed a decided improve-
ment. When the doctor saw my wife he told me
that, wonderful to say, she was better, and he
repeated his former statement, and told me not to
be astonished if she died at any moment. I told
him what I had been giving her, and ho said it was
no use giving it. I persevered with Clements
Tonic, and the fourth large bottle completely
restored her to health. She is now able to go
about as well as ever, and do her own housework ;
in fact, she has since attended to her daughter
and niece through their confinements, and nursed
a friend through typhoid fever. I feel so thankful
to you for your Clements Tonic that I should be.
acting ungratefully if I did not acknowledge the
wonderful cure your Clements Tonic has made.
I may say that in every case I advise people to try
it, it has had the same effect. 1 am well-known in
Balmain, holding as I do several medals from the
Royal Humane Society for saving life. Anyone
wishing to see me personally and ask me about
Clements Tonic can always find me at the above
address.—l remain, yours faithfully, Capt. P,
Connelly, 20 Elliott-street, Balmain, N.S.W.

It may be taken for granted that, warned
by the awful example of Lady Loch, the Countess
of Jersey would, like Lady Carington, at once set
her face against any proposal to present her with
a farewell testimonial of any intrinsic value. It
is not generally known that a well-known Sydney
firm of jewellers made an early move in anticipa-
tion of a big presentation to the departing Lady
Carington by importing from London a (£4000)
diamond necklace which would have turned the
colour of Lady Loch’s yellow by comparison. It
had to be sent back, however,

The men who are going to “New Australia”
are at any rate supposed to know enough to take
care of themselves, but it is a crying shame that
a lot of inexperienced girls should be inveigled to
join in such a scheme. There are plenty of hus-
bands for these girls in Old Australia, and, not-
withstanding Don Patagonia Lane’s girly-wirly
gusli aliout his “ tallest and straightest and
noblest ”of Western men, there will probably be
a good man or two left in this played-out old
country after the New Australians have gone.
Anyhow, to take a lot of girls on such a wild-cat
expedition is certainly not the thing. Why not
wait till the men have tried the place, and then,
if successful, send for the women?

New Divorce Act. X., in Melbourne,
came out of gaol last week, and found Mrs. X.
divorced, and married to Z., who kindly allowed
X. to stop in the house one night to see his little

Z. for stealing her jewellery, and Z. offered to go
bail for him ! The Bench wouldn’t take it, and
so the case waits.

A firm of Brisbane solicitors lately got an
opinion, in exchange for a liberal fee, from an
eminent local barrister, but, not feeling satisfied,
they submitted the case to a junior, who gave a
directly contrary opinion. The attorneys then
took the somewhat unusual course of submitting
the junior’s opinion to the big lawyer, who, on
reconsideration, confessed the young man was
right—and charged a further fee of 25 guineas

The spectacle of a man, reputedly worth
hundreds of thousands, parading Collins-street
with the ceiling of “ his most important garment ”
frayed right through, created both amusement
and alarm last Saturday morning. Perhaps they
were an old favourite pair worn out by the box-
seat of the coach ere he made his gigantic pile.
His wife, gorgeously attired, accompanied him,
serenely unconscious of the sensation.
The sudden disappearance from their usual
haunts of a once-popular actress and her equally
well-known hubby is said to have been caused by
the looming out on the horizon of the latter’s real
wife.

In Sydney Protestant Hall last week the
“Euphonic Orchestral Society” gave a concert
which should have been better advertised and
held in the great Centennial Hall for the benefit
of all who like hilarious humour. Young ladies
wrestled with clarionets and puffed into cornets
till their red cheeks looked like greedy boys’eating
quinces; also, a woman whacked a big drum,
tickled a triangle, clouted the cymbals, and rang
bells all by herself. It was enough to make the
gods weep.

Recently, in a N.S.W. country town, a
married woman, who was separated from her
drunken and particularly outrageous husband,
wanted to deposit her savings—about £lO0 —in the
bank. The manager, who knew her and her cir-
cumstances, refused to accept the deposit. “Go
and bury it in a paddock,” he said, “or bide it
up your chimney, or put it somewhere out of
sight. Anyhow, don’t put it in a bank, or your
husband will get it sooner or later, and you won’t
have any redress.” And now another woman
wants to know if marriage is a failure.
The Victorian
mace mystery is now
quite “ out.” It ap-
pears that the mace
was taken away from
Parliament House by
a drunken member
who really did not
know, until he awoke
next morning, that he
held the article. All
might have passed off
serenely had he not
chastised Liza
severely, a few months
back, when she swore
she would reveal the
mace story. She was
bought over at con-
siderable expense, but all the
same she told “ just a few.
“ He got so very drunk,” she
remarked, “that we really
couldn’t take it away from him.”

keet green, seated beside an equally adipose
old man in darning scarlet; behind, on a
grey horse, a Hindoo, his head encircled
by a dirty turban, followed by a gorgeous
vision in turkey-red, with belltopper dinted
down and oerched on two outstanding ears ;
the rear comprised a motley crew of men and

borne by screeching females in regulation

If George of Wales doesn’t marry his
brother’s relict-sweetheart it can be taken for
granted that mother-in-law-elect has intervened.
But the chances are that he will marry her after
all. May is about the only plump and pleasing
girl on his list of “possible” brides, and if he
sticks out for her with as much persistency as his
weakly relative stuck out, why George is bound to
get her. They can’t let him remain single. It is
a Royal Family belief that the Almighty is most
anxious to see a direct succession provided for.

The last will and
testament of Alfred
Arden, a Victorian sheep-
farmer, includes, amongst
other extraordinary mat-
ter, very particular in-
structions concerning his
family grave, where his
near relatives are exhorted
to plant their dead, “and
learn to love the living
for their sakes.” Arden
is evidently anxious to
encourage tombstone wor-
ship in Australia, for he
goes on to say—“lf the
press will deign to par-
take of and notice our
family re-unions (in the
cemetery) so much the
bettor light and publicity
on loyal aifd conservative
privacy will help to keep
us pure or incite to a
speedy remedy of any
declension without con-
fusing the principles of
exoteric or esoteric life
and excellence.” In the
absence of commas, the
only clear point in this
clause of Arden’s will is
his desire that a batch of
newspaper reporters will
get buried with each
member of the family, in
order to partake of the
remains. The Bulletin
approves of the sugges-
tion. Avdoad reporter is
better than a live ass.

The Oamaru (M.L.)
Borough Council lately
received a message, stat-

would pass through the

certain date. Where-
upon, a member moved
that “The Governor bo
allowed to pass.” Carried
unanimously.
When two people agree to die together for
love of each other it almost always happens that
one of them dies and the other one recovers and
attends the funeral. One day last week a New-
town (Sydney) small debts bailiff and his lady-love
agreed to commit a double* suicide. They were
both married, but they weren’t married to each
other, and that was what preyed on their minds.
In fact, a divorce action had been started, and
they were as much worried by law as by love.
There is a strange anti-climax about the idea of
any woman being driven to madness and death
for want of a bailiff, but every rule has_ its excep-
tions, and this bailiff was the exception. They
spent their last evening together in his office among
the writs and inventories, and afterwards wrote a
letter apiece with a blue pencil, as follows
30/1/92. lam about to die. lam about to bid all fare-
well. We have agreed to die for love, and it is better so,
as we cannot have each other in life. We mutually agree
to die together.— Robert Hastings.
30/1/93. Goodby all. I am dying with the one I love
of my own free will. Take care of my baby.—L. 0.
Rowlv.
Then they took a bottle of chlorodync each, and
the bailiff shot himself dead. The lady didn’t
shoot herself, and as the chlorodyno missed fire
somehow, she merely ran for assistance. When
the inquest came on she was well enough to attend
and hear her own letter read aloud by a matter-
of-fact wooden functionary who paid no attention
to his commas. It must have been a curious cere-
mony—almost like attending one’s own funeral
and helping to carry the remains. And now
The Bulletin expects to hear that the lady has
settled down to be a peaceful and affectionate wife
for the rest of her days, and to bring up the baby
in the way it should go, and that she will never
love another bailiff as long as she lives.

At Invercargill (M.L.) they “ installed ” a

A South Melbourne man, named Glacier,
aged 80, a colonist of 50 years’ standing, received
a commonplace note from a firm of London
solicitors one day last week, informing him that a
trifling sum of about fifteen hundred thousand
pounds, which has been in Chancery for many
years, will be at his disposal after a few formalities
have been gone through. Glacier was once a Mel-
bourne cabman. A Bulletin man who saw the
lawyer’s letter has been drinking ever since.

There is a certain Melbourne capitalist,
who, after commencing particularly low in the
social scale, has gradually pushed his way into
“society.” The drawback is that whenever lie
reaches a crowd a trifle more select than the
previous one his iqpntal strings give way and he
has to bo dragged off to a private asylum. His
last promotion was admittance to the first flight
—into the holy of holies—right among the frisky
matrons and maids of the South ; and the shock
again proved too great. He is now at his palatial
station residence fastened by a chain of chased
gold to a ring in the wall.

A Wanganui (M.L.) citizen advertises in
the local Herald that somebody has raided his
clothes-line in the night, and removed therefrom
two dozen necessary articles of baby attire. As
the baby is of no use without these articles, he
requests that (ha thief will call at his residence as
soon as possible, when he can have the infant also,
and no questions asked.

A dreadfully good man writes to an English
religious magazine, stating that his house was
infested by cockroaches, and every human means
ofrlestruction was tried in vain. Last of all, he
took refuge in fervent prayer, and the cockroaches
vanished immediately. Whereupon, someone else
wrote to the same magazine, asking if the editor
thought boots could bo cleaned by supplication,
but his letter was indignantly refused publication.

Nathaniel Kinsman, the expeditious
“marrier” of Fitzroy (Vic.), lectured recently on

advertising his show. He has married over 17,000

customers. “Don’t delay your weddings,” he
says, “but catch the first tram and have it over.
It is not nearly so severe as having a tooth pulled.”
The auctioneer-parson has married 43 persons at
point of death. This style meets with Mr. Kins-
man’s severest censure, but it has advantages that
commend it to many right-thinking men.

Dear Bulletin, I have a grievance
against artists who paint pictures and won’t, or
don’t, affix thereto explanatory titles. A thou-
sand times I have had my interest in what was
palpably a work of art, and of strong human in-
terest, completely destroyed from lack of know-
ledge of the subject. It is mere cant to say that
a “picture should tell its own tale.” Pictures
tell different tales to different imaginations, and
none of them may hit upon the particular tale
that the artist is telling. So one often finds he
has shuddered at a tragedy when he should have
laughed at a comedy.—Pelican.

The other day a Melbourne auctioneer was
driving over a railway-crossing about thirty miles
from the city. The gates being open, he took it
for granted that no trains were about, but just
then an engine came along, burst through the
gates, smashed the buggy, broke up the horse,
and, by amazing good luck, landed the auctioneer
in a sitting position on the hard road 22 yards
away, hatless and infuriated, but uninjured.
When he had gathered himself up, and shaken his
fist after the retreating engine, and blasphemed at
the guard, he walked to the adjacent station to
ask what in thunder it all meant. The result of
his enquiries was as follows: The station was in
A FRIEND’S LANGUAGE.
JONES (to his friend Snooks) : “You know Goldfinch, the banker.”
SNOOKS: “Yes.”
JONES: “Well, do you know he proposed to my wife when I was courting her—and she
refused him for me. What do you think of that?”
SNOOKS: “Think of it? Why, it just shows what idiots women sometimes can be.”
the solo charge of a woman. It was her business to
sell tickets to intending passengers, to collect
tickets from passengers arriving, to despatch tele-
grams, to receive telegrams, to work the block
system, signal advancing trains, run along
the line for a furlong or so to open the
gates at the crossing, scuttle back to shift the
points and slam the carriage-doors and tell the
driver to “go ahead,” refix the points once more,
hoist up the signals, gallop another 200 yards
along the sleepers to open the gates again, rush
back again and fill out returns for the traffic-
manager and the superintendent, tidy herself up
before the looking-glass, and then be blocked in
the middle of changing her frock to receive a tele-
gram, then try to do her hair and be interrupted by
somebody who wanted to know when the next
train started for nowhere, sit up late at night on
account of some stray freight-train, and get up in
the small hours of the morning to see the milk
train or the fish train through in safety, and
several hundred other things of greater or less
importance. She was a careworn-looking little
woman, and when the bruised auctioneer started
to storm at her on account of the mistake about
the gates she gave way to tears in the middle of
her explanation, and implored him not to report
her and deprive her of her billet. And when she
finished up by stating that the only time she
could get a bath without interruption was between
2.30 and 3 a.m., he swallowed his indignation and
told her that the buggy and the dead horse didn’t
matter after all. Then, in the fullness of his heart,
he got the affair hushed up somehow or other, and
the blessing of the tired little woman at that
lonesome railway-station rests on his head in con-
sequence. The incident is worth mentioning
because he is the only Melbourne financier who
has a blessing of any kind on his head these
times.

In one and the same Australasian Govern-
ment have been associated a member who keeps
two homes running simultaneously with a separate
lady at the head of each ; a gentleman who had to
pay pretty heavily for loving too fervently the
daughter of an official; and a third Minister who
is said to have children by two sisters, only one of
whom was hislawful wife. Yet this Cabinet took
high “moral” ground in respect to suggested
alterations of the Divorce Act, or of any other
statute affecting the relations of the sexes.
Answers to Correspondents.
No notice will Joe taken of communications which arrive
at this office insufficiently stamped. Name and
address must in every case appear on MS.
“Blue Bush”: Please send your address to
Mrs. E. Albert, Wellington, N.S.W., who believes she is
the sister of the David M'Kay whose death from thirst
between Corella and Alroy, N.Q., you recently reported....
“M.G.M.” (Hunter’s Hill): We want stories of flesh and
blood—not scenerj'.. ..“Victorian”: Thanks....“ The
Orphan”; We regretfully decline the story of the gentle
young wife who was strangled by her husband while ring-
ing the dinner-bell and thrown out of the window, and
who afterwards turns out to be a cow and a two-headed
calf. The transition is too sudden “ Democrat ”
(Launceston): A big grievance. Will use “Who
Struck Buckley ” : Nobody is going to rhyme “ majesty ”
with “Buckley” in this paper while we’re alive and out
of ga01... “Colour Box ” : The belated drunk who can’t
find the keyhole has been done to death ages ag0....
“ Busy Bee ” (Newtown Road); Good story, but sounds a
little like something that everybody has heard before ...
“ Scorpio ” : The one good point in the story is the state-
ment that “the only passenger in the coach was a
mounted trooper.” Mounted on what? “Young
Bachelor”: An inane smudge “J.T.” (Charleville):
It is sinfully irreverent thus to describe a live meat-
bishop “The Wanderer: Will probably use
“ Maoleay ” (Taree); An honourable but dirty communi-
cation. Better write to the Review of Reviews—London
edition....“ H. 0.” (Bywong); Compress it into a sen-
tence: You were floating; your head struck a mass of
blubber which swore violently, and finding it was a fat
man you gathered up your skirt and fled for the shore.
Good-night “ Ponte ” : One verse is enough, the
demand for puns being limited:
We killed an M.L.A., a trap, a bailiff and a Jew,
And lest with wealth they might grow proud we robbed a
priest or two;
But once we met a Scottish png—the loudest ever built,
So first of all we killed the prig and—then we prigged the
kilt,
We only made a shilling, but they made an awful fuss,
And striving thus to raise a bob a bob has lowered us ;
For we were caught and sentenced then, and thus the
sentence van :
Let Nosey Robert man the drop and let him drop the man.
... “J. 0.” (Cobargo); Thanks. Unluckily, The Bulle-
tin’s cured patient is “ on it ” again, so this paper’s faith
in the Tyson cure is a lost quantity....“ Y.T.B.’(“ The
Bleeding Toe ”): Your wail of toe is unsuitable. The MS.
with a nicely-decorated headline and fastened with red
tape always is unsuitable, somehow....“ Clio Cleope ” :
Try the local horror—not " the English article ..
“Apollo”: The ideal N.S.W. Cabinet would consist o*
the Bank of N.S.W., the Mont de Piete, Abraham Fried"
man’s estate (in liquidation), the liquidators of the Aus-
tralian Banking Co., several loan and discount companies,
accountant Taylor, Isaiah Cohen, and about six indivi-
duals named Nathan or Benjamin. The show is run by
money-lenders’ dummies ; why not put in the money-
lenders themselves? “ W.R.” : We dislike the hero
whose back name is “ Lorraine.” Why don’t you call
him plain John Borndrunk? ...“Mater 1893”: We pass
on King Darius, and the “Greek Slave,” and the
“ swollen leg and old.” What age was his other leg?...
“ A Nameless Bard ” : Your suspicions about the possible
dishonesty of Parkes’ father don’t interest us... “ Bil-
bong ” (Corowa) : If, as you say, “ Federation is dead,”
why prance so madly on the corpse? “A. Mountain ”;
A sleepy little yarn with a great snore and an unutterable
yawn in every line “A.P.” (Launceston): Not good
enough ; besides, our drink stories are mostly done on the
premises.... “A.S.” (Napier, M.L.): We aren’t taking a
hand in the “ Happiness in Hell” controversy “ Billy
Can ” (Arncliffe); We rather like your murder “ Dingo
B.” (Adelaide): Nothing new “ Oko ”; A tenant
who owes his landlord £1 rent and removes
from the house furniture to the value of, say,
£5O before the £1 is paid, is liable in N.S.W. to a fine of
double the value of the goods removed. Such are the
privileges of landlords ... “P. Corney ” : Write it in her
album if she’ll let you. If not, write it in some other
girl’s album. Love-poems are like diamond rings—they’ll
always fit at least two women “ 8.W.” (Ballarat, Vic.):
Insanity is written large all over your “poem”....
“ Dnalyh Dirf ” (Stanthorpe): This is true pathos :
“ Ho waited long, then travelled North
And tried to heal a breaking heart
By working on some mining field,
Or in some droving taking part.”
It reminds us of the man who, being overwhelmed by
grief, opened a pie shop “Isabelle” (South Mel-
bourne); Heavy and stilted. Why, for instance, does the
lieutenant go to a picnic “armed to the teeth ” ? No girl
wants to marry a walkin '; arsenal “ C. 1.” (8.H.):
Strongly advise you to say no word about it to any living
50u1.... “ Warrimoo” : If you aren’t remorseful, you
ought to be “ Frank B.”: Would need much cobbling.
The basic pun is ancient, anyhow.. . “ Leo II.” : Simply
bald abuse of some very mean pe0p1e,...“ E. A.deQ,” :
Neither rhyme nor rhythm “ W.J.5.”(238): Only two
of use. The other ancient. Please ca 11.... “ H.C.J.”
(B.): Thanks. Write again... “C.S.G.”: Thanks, but
we can hardly use it.... “ Euchre ” : Pretty verses, on a
well-worn subject. May print, some day...“ F. Eric ”:
Many thanks “ Thos. C.” (M. L.): Impossibly long.
Three columns will be our utmost limit even for Shakes-
peare the Second when he arises " D.M*I.” (Syd.):
Much obliged... “ Joe the Cook”: Gossipy and good.
Several it°rns usable.... “ T.P.” (Melb.); Can’t say where
you’ll find a Bulletin file in Melb. The verses will b<
re-published shortly ..“E.H.” (Charleville): (1) Name
the poem and we’ll let you know. (2) It bears the stamp
of swindle “J.A.Mac.”: Dymock, bookseller, Sydney,
would send you Phil. May’s Annual for about Is. Bd.,
postage included “ E. 0.” : Annie Besant has a
peculiarly impressionable organisation. She learned to
reason, and also that curious habit with her tongue, from
the late Chas. Bradlaugh. She has now learned Unreason
and Theosophy from Blavatsky and Olcott “Marble
Man ” : Can a human being turn to stone ? Yes ; you hit
a larrikin and see how quickly he turns to stone —the
handiest stone. Generally road metal... “F. Swift”:
Write to Dr. F. Norton-Manning, Callan Park Asylum,
Sydney “J. M‘W.” : Good. Substituted accordingly.
.. ..“Jerome Darnet” : You have read Max Nordau?....
“ Mixed Pickles” : The game is founded on the existence
of many synonyms . .“Donald MacD.” : Ancient idea.
... “D.T.M.”: Doubtless funny when it occurred, but
all its life hath now departed “John P.” (D’ hurst) :
Clever idea, but too broad for accentuation by illustration.
“B. Ad.” (Brisbane): Excellent....“ James B.” :
Dymock, George-street, Sydney, will supply you with the
book. (2.) The Bulletin people have quite enough to do
already “M.T.”: That sort of verse is out of The
Bulletin’s way. We don’t want to become a mere album.
“ 8.G.” (Ball.): Thanks “ Eaoy H.” : Coals to
Newcastle. You send us our own story “Colo”: See
Gordon and Gotch. The entire Victorian country press
seems to be for sale just now “ W.J.8.” (Melb.):
Recalls the old times when Berry, Patterson and Co. made
aJ.P. of the late lamented Aaron Waxman, Esq
“ George H. J.”: The Bulletin tries to be original, and
abhors the scrap-book business....“ Simpleton ” : Nearly,
but not quite. Please ca 11.... “ Sidney H. Preston ” : An
undisguised advt “The Orphan”: The O’Rell’s
“ forthcoming story ” has already been told in The Bul-
letin “Frank W.”: Unsuitable. Both obviously
written under the delusion that The Bulletin is a
“ comic ” paper. Reading “ comic " papers is to the
mind what eating three pints of treacle would be to the
stomach.
The War Scare Again.
In Europe the periodical alarm occasioned by this
cry, seems to increase in intensity each succeeding
year, and a general consensus of opinion prevails
that the mighty strain caused by the constant
increase of armaments and their vast cost, must
necessarily, at no very distant date, produce a
convulsion among the nations somewhat analogous
to the bursting forth of a number of huge
volcanoes breathing devastation and death all
round. Reasons are not wanting in support of
the common belief that a tremendous war is
imminent. Russia’s long nurtured aspirations for
extension of territory and longings for a foot-hold
in European Turkey, and the attitude of France
and Germany towards each other are considered to
be potent factors tending to a precipitation of the
crisis.
Other elements exist fraught with danger to the
world’s peace. The far-reaching, indeed almost
universal, conflict proceeding twixt labour and
capital, and the vile machinations of Anarchists
and Socialists, are daily adding to the uneasiness
of the times in which we live.
WAR IS ALREADY DECLARED!
through the indiscriminate manner in which the
livers and kidneys of men are invaded by diseases
of those vital organs and the thousand and one
different and varying symptoms accompanying
and indicating the attacks, but
A PROCLAMATION OF PEACE!
may speedily be made to suffering men and
women if they adopt the precaution to make use
of Warner’s Safe Cure and Pills. They may be
relied upon to quickly subdue the ill-concealed
rebellion these diseases manifest in the little but
important world of the human economy. These
medicines, by renovating and purifying the blood,
become the natural enemies of the complaints
referred to. Their immediate application is the
panacea for the total destruction of both the cause
and effect, and they may bo aptly described as
promoters of “peace upon earth and good will
towards men.”
The beneficial influence of Warner’s Safe Cure
is well illustrated by the following case Towns-
ville, Queensland, November 30th, 1892. Messrs.
H. H. Warner & Co. It gives me very great
pleasure to testify as to the value of your remedies.
1 have suffered for the past two years from what
is commonly known to us Northerners as “chronic
liver,” and after trying almost everything else
without avail I had a go at Safe Cure, which, I
am glad to say, completely cured me. I can now
sleep soundly, eat well, and, above all, can attend
to business as a pleasure—in fact, I feel quite a
new person since taking the medicine, which is
worth its weight in gold. I have since advised all
my friends to use it, and we are going to give the
livers a rough time of it. I feel assured that if
many people who to-day are suffering and allow-
ing their ailments to drag them into their graves,
only knew how easily they could bo relieved, they
would, by the use of your remedies, soon become
healthy and happy men and women. (Signed)
Geo. A. Gray, Grocer, Townsville.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The V.K.O. committee has solemnly ratified
the sentences passed by the Caulfield stewards upon
certain performers in the “Islander” scandal, and the
usual outburst of admiration at these “ drastic measures
for purifying the Turf” has occurred. The people behind
Islander happened to be uninfluentia), with the excep-
tion of one bookmaker, who escaped with a caution.
Also, the swindle was too apparent to be passed oyer.
But at the forthcoming Y.R.C. meeting the authorities
will swallow such “sudden reversals of form ” as would
choke an alligator, always provided that the eccentric
animals belong to powerful syndicates, and the victimised
public are too dense to understand that they have been
robbed. What the stewards will do when a kind of
Matthew Davies owner comes to be railed upon by the
mob is a conundrum The Bulletin can’t answer. Pro-
bably they will all sit atop of the Stewards’ Stand and
shout “ S lame !” Not “ shame ” upon the high-class
owners of high-class horses, but “shame ” upon the vulgar
wretches who object to being eternally “ had.”

One Levey, of Melbourne, is said to have lost
his reason through being sat upon for running a horse
“cronk.” Friend Barney Allen, calling upon Levey to
sympathise with him over the loss of all that he held dear
—viz., honour —found that grief had driven the poor
fellow “hopelessly insane.” Too mueh soul—that was
the matter with the unhappy Levey.

As jockey Barbour was leaving the Stewards’
Stand at Caulfield the other Saturday, alter receiving
sentence of six months’ disqualification, the lad
was overtaken by a well-known barrister who
very palpably gave liim a piece of paper. _ Judging from
the sympathetic manner of the lawyer in making the
presentation it is probable that the paper contained a
few words of good advice. Anyway, Barbour put it
quietly into his pocket and seemed grateful. There were
few spectators of this little incident, which escaped notice
by the reporters.

Let the colts of the eighth Australian Eleven
take warning. Hobnobbing with and borrowing cool
hundreds from brainless samples of the aristocracy, and
emphasizing your importance by resting your feet on

A good story was heard, the other day, “ on the
hill,” at the N.S.W.-Vic. match, about a cricketer who
much fancied himself. Some friends induced him to back
himself for some four or five pounds, which they sub-
scribed against him, in a single-wicket match. He was to
go out and arrange for the use of the Association Ground
for a couple of hours. He accordingly drove to the
ground and made all arrangements. Imagine his disgust
when he asked what man they’d got against him. The
answer was, “ Man be dashed—it’s Mrs. , the care-
taker of our office.” Match still unplayed.

“ Gawge ” Giffen would certainly not have gone
to England if Walter’s inclusion had been condemned by
the Cricket Council. Jack Lyons has repeatedly told the
writer that he would also have stayed behind. Not a
very nice attitude to assume, certainly.

The Norwoods, the team which includes G. and
W. Giffen, Lyons, and other cracks, will have to climb
down from top place in Adelaide cricket this season.
S mth Adelaides, through the lightning Jones, have not
lost a match. The other Saturday Jones got 6 for 49, five
clean bowled.

J. Reedman, the S.A. cricketer, has a club
average this season of 51, and in inter-provincial matches
31 for 6 innings. He is also a fair bowler and a brilliant
fieldsman. George Giffen was a far inferior player when
he was first put in an Australian Eleven.

Text for a temperance-sermon. At Rand wick,
on Anniversary Day, one bookmaker in the Leger became
so drunk that, after the two-year-old race, he had to get
a friend to read his tickets. Some “fly” people went
round the course taking long shots about the winner, but
would have nothing to do with the tipsy one, who laid
any sort of odds that came to his tongue. He was about
the only book who got a “ skinner ” on the race.

“ St. Hippo is as good as Carbine.” Good judges
who saw him in Sydney say he would fetch twice as much as
the latter at sale, supposing performances were not known.
There is no reason why he should not be the better per-
former, except this one—that no Australian racehorse ever
was Carbine's equal, while scores have been “going to
be.” Carbine, by the way, wasabout-the only Maoriland
crack whose first Australian appearances the touts and
judges “couldn’t stand.” “Don’t half like the look of
his hocks,” they said.

It is averred that Graham and Coningham
“ are being taken to England under different agreements
to the other twelve, i.e., that they are not to share in any

with having only their expenses paid.” Let’s see—the
Australian Eleven are all amateurs ?

The sporting reporter of the S.A. Advertiser

Graham, the eleventh-hour member of the Aus-
tralian Eleven, is the son of a Melbourne barber. The
“ hoy ” is vaguely understood to be a dentist’s assistant
by profession, but his tastes run in the direction of
cricket. He regards Blaokham with some awe, which
circumstance may happily prove an important factor in
his batting average on tour.
Dear Bulletin, —The other week you credited
Peall’s break of 571, in a spot-barred match, with “the

Good news for the Australian cock-fighting
crowd. It has just been decided by the highest Court in
Scotland that cock-fighting is not illegal. The Judges
hold that if the Legislature intended to suppress it under
the Gaming Act, it would have been specifically named as
being illegal. As Ibis lias not been done, it is assumed
that it was never intended to interfere with it.

A correspondent forwards a story about a
prize - fight which took place, according to his
legend, between two local athletes, in a little town in
California. There was very little science displayed, but
after 35 minutes' scrambling the favourite bit his
opponent’s nose off and won. The loser, contrary to all
the traditions of the sport, sued the winner for assault,
and the local functionaries reluctantly committed him
for trial, and trusted to the wooden-headedness of the old
Dutch Judge to get him off. That heavy luminary ful-
filled their best expectations. The only available defence
was that the plaintiff bit off his own nose, and, having
heard the evidence, the bench proceeded to sum up :
“ Yentlemen of the yury, what can I say about dis gase?
Here vas der brosegutor midout his nose, vich he vas
schware der brisoner vas bide off in a vite, und here vas
der brisoner who vas admid der vite, but vas say the
brosegutor vas bide his own nose off. All I can say,
yentlemen, is dot ef der brosegutor vas bide his own nose
off, he must have done it mit a sudden yerk.” Verdict
of “notguilty” based on the “sudden yerk” theory.
The N.S.W. Labour-Party’s Opportunity
Since the division on Parkes’ no-confidence motion
left the N.S.W. Government with an unworkable
majority of only three, a report gains cur-
rency that the Dibbs-Barton Cabinet has secured
the support of a considerable proportion of the
hostile section of the Labour-party on certain con-
ditions. These conditions are generally under-
stood to be that the Cabinet pushes on various
democratic measures in the Assembly, and that,
if necessary, it will send sufficient democrats to
the Council to swamp the opposition of the Tory
nominees. In other words, the great bulk of the
Labour Party, it is said, will vote for the Ministry
so long as' the Ministry meets its views on cer-
tain well-defined points, just as the Pro-
tectionists support Dibbs so long as he meets
their views, and as the Foreign - traders
support Parkes and Reid while these two indi-
viduals undertake to howl for their doctrines.
The Foreign-trade press, which hoped to get the
Labour vote on exactly the same conditions and
wrathfully saw the negotiation fall through, now
shrieks dismally over what it calls am “ immoral ”
compact, but the compact is in strict accordance
with the principles—if there are any principles—
of Party Government. By this new shuffling of
the cards the Labour-party’s prospects are much
improved, and if it can by any possibility main-
tain a solid front there is no reason why it should
not force the Ministry to gostraight. The party will
never be absolutely homogeneous; it is afflicted
with sundry religious cranks like ex-preacher Cot-
ton, and teetotal cranks like 6. D. Clark, and other
assorted cranks of less note, and for some reason
that has never been explained this parsonieal and
cold-water element always votes for Parkes, no
matter what political principles may be sacrificed.
Parkes, who talks with a pious twang when
it suits him, has always been the centre
of the snuffling and old-woman faction in
the N.S. Wales Legislature, and almost all
the semi-insane fads of the Assembly revolve
round him. But even apart from this partially-
deranged faction, the Labour-party in the House
is sufficiently strong to exact valuable concessions
from the Dibbs Cabinet—if it can only pre-
serve anything like solidity. If such a strong
man as Seddon, of Maoriland, could be im-
ported as leaderr it would be well worth while
to pay him £2OOO a year for his services in
putting a hobnailed boot down on the miserable
squabbles which have hitherto reduced the Labour
vote to impotence. The business of the Demo-
cratic body is not to sympathise with Reid or
Dibbs or any other outside politician, but
to support Dibbs and, if it pleases, to
loathe him and his title at the same
time just so long as any Democratic
measures can be extracted from him, no matter
how unwillingly; and when his usefulness is ex-
hausted, to throw him away remorselessly, and sup-
port Parkes (who hates it, and has reason to hate it,
like poison) or any other hypocrite for the same
purpose, and to the same extent. It should have
no extraneous friendships. It should recognise
that the other two parties are equally its
enemies at heart, and detest them both, and use
them impartially. And when the time comes that
there are no further concessions to be obtained
from either, then it should drive them into coali-
tion, and take possession of the Opposition
benches itself, and sink its ill-chosen name for the
wider designation of the Democratic party, and
then all the malcontents —and under a coalition
they are many—would be compelled by party
exigencies to accept their programme, and throw
in their lot with them. But first of all, and above
all, they require to find a leader ; otherwise some
plausible, fish-blooded, respectable political
schemer like Wise will ultimately assume the
billet, and lead them, in a dull, commonplace
fashion, to destruction. The labour-party has
everything to lose by a dissolution just now. The
other crowd, who long to smash it utterly, have
everything to gain. They have their hands on the
screw of the garotte—the daily sup-press.

To Messrs, Bosisto and Co., —
It is with pleasure that I write to state
my opinion of your Eucalyptus Oil. It is de-
cidedly better than any other similar oil which
can be obtained in this country.
It is a lighter, clearer and more ethereal oil
than any I have hitherto used, besides being free
from the heavy, nauseous odour characteristic of
others.
This is particularly noticeable when the oil is
sprayed into the throat.
It is very palatable when taken internally,
which places it above other preparations and con-
siderably enhances its value.
(Signed),

fessor of Zoology, Anderson’s Coll. :

This is a business announcement, and that is
just the reason why you should read it right
through. One of the greatest
SECRETS OF THE DAY
is to successfully combat diseases and attain to a
serene and comfortable old age. Strategy is the
greatest
ART OF WAR.
By the aid of strategy you can get the enemy into
a fog and lose him there. Of course it is not con-
sidered strategy to find him again. But no
matter. A vegetarian tract recently published
imparts the cheerful intelligence that more people
are killed or disabled by
EXCESSIVE EATING
than by drink. This is, doubtless, true. Take
the tramp, for instance, who lives principally on
suction, and see how hardy he is. His excuse for
drinking is that it aids digestion. You can get
trichinosis from eating pork, he tells you, but not
from
DRINKING . BEER.
About the only thing you can drink that is
really injurious to health is water. When you
move into a strange city you are generally advised
to “look out for the water.” The best way to
carry this instruction into execution is to inquire
for whisky at the threepenny bars.
NO SANE MAN,
however, will think of drinking St. Jacobs Oil,
because it is not a beverage for internal use. But
if he is troubled with neuralgia or rheumatism, or
is the'possessor of
AN ACHING TOOTH,
a cold on the chest, or a sprained foot, reason will
dictate to him that an external remedy such as St.
Jacobs Oil, which never fails to effect a speedy
and permanent cure, is worth
A MILLION OF MONEY.
No other specific ever placed in the trade has
met with such unprecedented success, a fact which
is verified by the numberless testimonials re-
ceived proclaiming its sterling value. It is beyond
doubt the
BEST DOMESTIC REMEDY
that can be kept in the house, whether the home
be that of a merchant prince or the humble son of
toil.

Daily papers begin to speak of Australian
townships as “ villages.” D n !
Attention is drawn to the date {vide page

Word Competition closes.
There is a screw loose in the thrilling nar-
rative of the Norwegian ship Thekla. Nine of the
crew remained without food for 13 days, at the end
of which time a Dutchman was sacrificed to the
hunger of the surviving eight, who, when rescued,
“ were found to be mad.” If they were all crazy,
whence comes the authority for the yarn ?
A soul-stirring Chinese tragedy is reported
from Adelaide. Gin Gah, a truculent Mongol of
that city, had for his wife a white girl, aged 19.
Gah himself was 56. They had been married just
eight months; the wedding came off last June at
Trinity Church, where Parson Reid solemnly
blessed the union of this ancient from Leperland
and his bride. Some time after the marriage Ah
Dick Chuck began to look kindly upon the young
wife, and on one occasion Gah informed his
mother-in-law that he would amputate the lady’s
legs with a carving-knife if she didn’t give up
Chuck’s society. He also threatened to shoot that
Asiatic deceiver if he haunted his (Gin Gah’s)
house any longer, but the wretched Chow declined
the warning, and rushed miserably on to his own
destruction. The end of it all was that Gah cut
his wife into a considerable number of pieces with
a knife, then made many holes in Ah Dick Chuck,
and finally suicided. The Bulletin trusts that the
parson who married the pair will be present at
the inquest, and that he will enjoy himself while
he is there.
IT’S GONE, ALL GONE, AND I’M GOING
TOO.
Foe many a year did the same man sweep a
certain street-crossing in Hampstead. Through
all seasons and in all weathers, there he was,
sweeping the crossing and taking such gratuities
as were given him. Time wore away, and became
to be eighty years old. He appeared at his post
no more. A lady district visitor looked him up at
his lodgings. What a picture of squalid destitu-
tion. No fire, no food, no friends. Wife and
family he had none—never had. The poor old
fellow was perishing of starvation, of want. Some
money was raised for his benefit and he was re-
moved to a London hospital. Here he lay several
weeks, sinking daily. One night he was clearly
very low. Near him stood one of the hospital
physicians and a nurse. Seeing him clutch
nervously at his pillow, the nurse, supposing the
patient desired to be raised up, put his arm
beneath him to perform that service. In doing
so the nurse’s hand came in contact with an
object which he withdrew. It was a dirty little
canvas bag tied with a leather string. As it was
laid aside the old man perceived what had been
done, lifted his skeleton frame partially from the
bed and, trembling with excitement, said in a
shrill whisper, “Ah! my treasure, my treasure!
It’s gone, all gone, and I’m going too !” and sank
back dead. The bag contained £5OO in notes—
the savings of his miserly life. And he, there,
dead of starvation, even more than of age. Well,
what of it ? you say. The wretched old man was
better dead than alive. Quite so, but most
human events have a moral, a lesson, about them,
if we keep an eye out for it.
What, for example, can we learn from the
following facts? —One night about ten years ago a
man, whose name we can furnish, went to bed as
usual, apparently in good health and spirits. A
few hours later he lay unconscious on the floor.
In explanation lie stated that he had been seized,
suddenly, with a pain of such violence that he was
compelled to rise—a pain in the chest. After
rising he lost his senses and sank down on the
spot where he had stood. His wife, aroused by
the noise, struck a light and saw her husband in
that situation. She afterwards declared he had
gone black in the face, and that his eyes looked as
if they were starting out of his head.
Restoratives were applied which brought him
to, but he was not as before. So quickly and un-
expectedly do we cross the boundary line between
two opposite bodily conditions. It is like
stepping from the broad blaze of day into a damp
cavern packed with darkness. He felt weak and
sick, with a strange “all-gone” sensation through-
out his whole system. His mouth tasted badly,
and was filled with a slimy sort of phlegm, his
head ached, he was unable to draw a deep breath,
he walked with difficulty, and went about his
business like a man who is haunted by a para-
lysing dream.
Perplexed and alarmed he consulted physicians,
who prescribed for him, without, however, pro-
ducing any noticeable improvement. The strong,
clear-headed man of previous years was gone—
changed as by the wand of a vicious magician into
the feeble being he now was. Even with this
dismal prospect before him our friend travelled
not on level ground ; his path led downward ; he
grew worse. In December, 1888, he had a dis-
tinct and bad attack, gave up business, and went
to bed. There he remained for a weary painful
month—thirty days, as long as thirty years of
power and occupation. The doctor said there was
something wrong with the stomach and bowels.
After he once more rose from his bed he still
suffered dreadful pain and could rest neither day
or night. Indeed, some nights he never slept a
moment. So weak had he become that when he
attempted a short walk he was obliged to aban-
don the effort, return and go to bed.
_ His own words are these: —“To give you an
idea how reduced I had become I may mention
that I lost over three stone weight and was wast-
ing away. 1 kept on like this until January,
1891, when Mr. Everson, of Ocoold, told me of a
medicine called Mother Seigel’s Syrup and the
good it had done, I tried it and in three days I
felt better. Cheered and encouraged by tin's I
continued to use it, with the result that I wholly
recovered from my mysterious malady. lam now
strong and hearty, and business is again a
pleasure. The Syrup did me more good in a few
weeks than ail my ten years doctoring put to-
gether.” (Signed) Albert Thorndyke, Proprietor
of the “Grapes Inn,” Church Street, Eye,
Suffolk. May Ist, 1891.
What do we learn from this? We learn that
while a miserly fool like our crossing-sweeper may
starve for money, a wise man with more reverence
for his bodily temple, seeks and finds a remedy
for a tendency to starvation, induced by disease —
that the disease was indigestion and dyspepsia,
and the remedy Mother Seigel’s Syrup.
Respect for alleged “ good birth ” is de-
risively called in the United States “daddyism.”
London Figaro steals wholesale from The
Bulletin, then speaks of it as “ a Melbourne
paper.”
‘ ‘ If the mortality were not greater among
illegitimate than among legitimate children, every
fifteenth person in England must be of illegitimate
extraction,” said a late Registrar-General.
Mr. Nelson P. Whitelocke, of the Bathurst
(N.S.W.) National Advocate, writes to state
that it was certainly not he who wrote to Premier
Dibbs cheering him on in the matter of the pro-
posed Income-Tax.
A well-known Sydney man alleges that he
has lost nearly £50,000 in the last six months
through being called upon to pay up guarantees
given for “ friends.” Hebrews rarely have

A dead wall has just been taken down at
Robson and Bussell’s drapery shop, Melbourne.
It exposed a mass of placards of the gold-
fields era. There was a green playbill of G. V.
Brooke, in “A New Way to Pay Old Debts.”
A Maoriland contemporary says : —“ The
alleged original title-deed of Melbourne, which
has been acquired by the British Museum, was
engrossed by ‘ Gellibrand, engrosser, Hobart.’
This gives it away, because Hobart was Hobart
Town in those days, and long afterwards.”
Old woman witness in Minyip Court, Yic.,

more sacred than Justice herself. When will a
lawyer get three days for contempt of witnesses?
The N.S.W, country policeman who
arrested defaulter Humphries is, according to
Melbourne Standard, a regular Yidocq. Meeting
Humphries in the township he said, “Isn’t your
name Humphries?” To which the latter, of
course, replied “No.” “Then what are you
doing with Humphries’ watch ?” said the bold
officer. “ I must arrest you on suspicion of steal-
ing it.” And accordingly Humphries was run in
for stealing his own watch, and detained until a
warrant came to hand for his arrest on quite
another charge.
We have received a copy of Hazell’s
Annual for 1893. It is a handy cyclopaedia,
giving the history of the world for the
past year, biographies of prominent men, new
laws, lies, fads, diseases, epidemics, sins, dis-
coveries, inventions, political and social agita-
tions, commercial news, sports, pastimes—every-
thing. Among the “ new articles ” for the year
is a biography of G. Republican Dibbs (N.S.W.),
which winds up with the assertion that he is “ an
eminently handsome man.”
Prof. Richards, the “ electric healer,” has
struck snags in Melbourne. One sceptic wants to
know how it is that a girl who had been deaf from
her second year, and whom the Prof, had cured,
could speak so readily and answer questions so
fluently, and remarked that she must have been
an unusually precocious child to have acquired
such a vocabulary at the early age of two.
Another says it is strange that a man who had
been stone blind since his birth could not only
distinguish colours after the Prof, had handled
him, but could actually name them.
We came across an English comic paper
the other day. It was a trifle more comio than
the average of its kind. Here follows a sample of
the sort of humour at which Bull shrieks :
I, the Bounder, do make my mark thus O, and affirm
that I, the superior, supernal, and superlative Bounder
did behold, supervise, and witness the Rival Ruggers’
ranging for revenge at Richmond last Saturday as ever
was. At 1.30 p.m. I did wait upon Slawkenbergius, the
greatest ballet artist of any clime, time, or nime, with a long
pole. I found the great Smudgist, as I expected, in his
truckle bed, with nothing visible but his nose, which
stuck up out of the bedclothes like a No. 9 boomerang.
There are three columns of this, and the circula-
tion of the awful rag is alleged to be going up
rapidly.
A few more items from Argentina : “There
are 42,000 (?) lawsuits pending in Buenos Ayres,
and last week was terminated one which had
lasted 40 years. The new Cabinet consists entirely
of lawyers. The dollar, formerly worth 4s. 2d., is
now valued at Is. 4_d. About 90 per cent, of the
railways belong to English companies, the Govern-
ment having guaranteed the interest. On one line
alone, which cost <£970,000, the country has
already paid £1,060,000 to make up the deficiency
in the guaranteed rate of dividend. Recently the
municipality of Bolivar decided to ‘ resume ’ the
farms of certain German and Italian settlers who
bought their land from the Government in 1885.
Accordingly, 40 police went down and opened fire
on the settlers, and burned several houses, but the
Germans and Italians promptly rolled up with
guns and chased them several miles. The com-
manding officer was killed and one Judge badly
wounded.”
Dear Bulletin, —One of the best-known
traders in the lately-annexed Pacific islands is a
Sydney native, Jack O’Brien—he was born on
Church Hill 70 years ago—now living with true
patriarchal dignity on the beautiful lagoon island
of Funafuti, in the midst of an imposing family of
half-castes —stalwart sons and fair, handsome
daughters—one of whom, Petise (Betsy), is the
belle of the Ellice Group, and much sought in
marriage by many respectable traders. Old
“Tiaki,” as he is called by the natives, is,
despite his age, as tall and upright and straight
(both morally and physically) as a young cocoanut
palm, and his clean-shaven, bronzed, and sun-
aired face is the index to his character—a brave,
simple-hearted, hospitable old fellow, ignorant as
a child of the outside world. He is possessed of a
vast fund of Oceanic anecdota and Island lore, and
can talk fascinatingly for hours of the two Peru-
vian slavers that swept through the Ellice Group
in 1866; of Captains “ Bully ” Hayes and Peese,
and their dark doings of blood and love and mur-
der generally. Jack is one of the few old hands
who have not degenerated into utterly broken-
down, gin-drinking, debauched beachcombers.
He and a few others like him, hardy, industrious
and temperate, are the prototypes of Fenimore
Cooper’s “Leatherstocking.” Of the other sort
there are plenty both young and old—drunken,
licentious, foul-mouthed and unutterably vile,
good enough to be employed as recruiting-agents
by the Honolulu labour ships, but regarded even
by a naturally sensual native race asdegraded and
not-to-be-iissocinted-with Papalagi tafea (outcast
whites).— Fauteau.

Whereas, I suffered severely from a very troublesome

I, as a last hope, obtained some of Herr Rassmussen’s
FURELT HERBAL “ UNIVERSAL ALP ALINE

COMPLETELY CURED ME within a few weeks, and
although this is over five years ago, I have remained well ever
since.
THE ALFALINE PILLS also cured my wife, and I make
this solemn declaration, conscientiously believing the same to
be true.

“ Herr Rassmussen has shown us some highly compli-
mentary Testimonials which he has received certifying to

the great cures performed by Herr Rassmussen, the Cele-
brated Danish Herbalist’s remedies.”— Australian Star.

Truth. His Herbal Remedies are unequalled.”— Truth.

Herbalist, holds the highest place in the Colonies, and enjoys
the confidence of many of the leading people of N.S. Wales,
Victoria, and Queensland.” — Cooktown Courier (Q.).

Rassmussen has now been established in the colonies for
nearly 10 years.”—Sydney Sunday Times.

Dyspepsia.
Indigestion.
Constipation
There is a gentle-
man at Malden-on-
the-Hudson, N. Y.,
named Captain A. G. Pareis, who
has written us a letter in which it
is evident that he has made up his
mind concerning some things, and
this is what he says:
‘‘ I have used your preparation
called August Flower in my family
for seven or eight years. It is con-
stantly in my house, and we consider
it the best remedy for Indigestion,
and Constipation we
have ever used or
know.n. My wife is
troubled with Dyspepsia, and at
times suffers very much after eating.
The August Flower, however, re-
lieves the difficulty. My wife fre-
quently says to me when I amjgoing
to town, ‘We are out
•of August Flower,
and I think you had
fetter get another bottle, ’ lam also
troubled with Indigestion, and when-
ever I am, I take one or two tea-
spoonfuls before eating, for a day or
two, and all trouble is removed.” ®

How Shepherd Dick Crossed the Border.
(FOR THE BULLETIN. )
Yarrobamine Station, situated in South
Australia, adjoining tho Northern border of N.S.
Wales in that part of the country termed locally
the “ Big Plain,” was not blessed with an abun-
dant rainfall, and but for the station being in the
hands of a mortgage company, which, with the
assistance of skinflint overseers, continue to
balance any losses by the heavy charges made to
station hands for extras, Yarrobamine would,
perhaps, now be advertised weekly in the Gazette
as Grown lands requiring a tenant. The said
mortgage co. had taken the country over from the
former tenant to cover heavy advances on
the stock and plant, and its main reason for
holding on was to screw out of the Government
compensation for improvements.
With the station there was also taken over what
was an indispensable piece of working stock, viz.,
Shepherd Dick. For years, many hands had
come and gone after the usual manner of bush-
men, but the silent, moody Shepherd Dick had
worked on the station, good seasons and bad
seasons, for fifteen years. No one knew his
history—but no one sought to approach him on
this subject, after once catching a glance of those
fiery eyes.
“Dick’’lived with his old half-bred collie at
Mackenzie’s camp hut, at tho northernmost part
of the run, and had as his occupation the charg
of a 70-mile paddock carrying sheep. It was 0
lonely life,*fcJJut it suited his nature. Hi
only sight of other human face was when th a
ration-cart came round once in three weeks, o' 5
else the overseer—a heartless bully, dreaded by 0
all the boundary-riders, as he generally managed”
to drop on them unawares. The hut was built of
the usual pug walls, with rough, unhewn beams
supportinga roof of thatched cane-grass. Continued
wear of rain, wind, and sandstorm had worn the
walls very thin. Repairs were considered a waste
of money, Government rebate being only for
water improvements.
It was a sultry evening when Dick let his horse
adrift to get what picking he could from the
stunted saltbush, and, whistling his dog, dragged
his weary legs towards the weather-beaten hut.
There were signs in the distant sky of an approach-
ing storm. Tracks in the sand pointed to the
visit in his absence of the ration-cart—come to
dole out the customary allowance of flour, sugar,
tea, and salt, with never an ounce oveTweight
even in the latter article. There had also been left
the usual bottle of whisky which Dick was able to
obtain through the friendly agency of the fort-
nightly mail-driver, who carried it at the risk of
the loss of his contract with the Government.
With this solace to his loneliness it was too much
trouble even to blacken his customary chop on the
hut fire.
The loud crashing of thunder, followed by the
falling of heavy drops of rain down the wide
chimney denoted that the storm had at last
broken in earnest. The dog crouched whiningly
alongside the bunk of his master —who lay at full
length thereon enjoying his pipe. The wind grew
to a gale, one of those hurricane storms winch
carry all before them.
* * #
Crash ! The outer wall of the hut had at
last succumbed to wear of weather. The heavy
cross-beam supporting the cane-grass roof fell
in—and across the legs of the man, pinning him
just above the knees on to his galvanised-iron-case
shake down. It did not break the limbs —the
weight of the beam having been warded off by the
ledge of the case.
Stunned by the shock, it was some time ere
Dick recovered sufficiently to realise the horror of
his fixture—his feeble efforts to move the beam
were wasted. Thirty miles from any other human
being, and little chance of a visitor within a fort-
night at least; even his dog killed by the falling
wall. The whisky was within reach. With eager
outstretched arm he seized the bottle and emptied
half its contents down his fevered throat. Relief !
Yes, if there is relief in madness. What horrid
thought comes to the maddened brain? With a
heavy blow the bottle is shattered on the beam,
and the neck, with a sharp piece adhering, is
dragged repeatedly by the already doomed man
across his throat. Which is it, accident or suicide ?
Neither !
• • #
Ten days later, Blakeney, the overseer,
visiting the hut, saw at a glance the position of
affairs. It would never do to have such, an
occurrence recorded against his company. A
match applied to the dry cane-grass roof left in a
few hours but three blackened mud walls and no
witnesses.
* * #
By instructions received from the over-
seer, the station bookkeeper made the following
entry in his ledger :
Mr. Ulakeney, overseer’s a/c. Cr. by paying of
“ Shepherd Dick ” on private a/c., 8 weeks wages at 15s. ;
£6.
Dick, it was reported, had, after being paid off for
drunkenness, started to cross the border into
Queensland in search of another job. There is no
doubt he crossed the Border.
N.

junction with the sewer miners, is engaged on a
co-operative contract at Cockatoo Island (Sydney),
where its members are earning bigger wages and
turning out better work than under the contract
system.

Mr. O. H. Reid may now appropriately emblazon upon
his political banner. He has “come”' thrice; he has
thrice thought that he saw his opportunity, and he has
thrice been defeated.

Here at Last!
Some seven years ago a strange thing happened to the lady
whose photo, appeals herewith, whereby she became
-A. MYSTERY
Which no one can explain or account for so far, not even her
husband. How it happened was this : She lay dying of a compli-
cation of diseases ; often she would faint off, and lie unconscious
as long as 30 hours at a stretch—frigid as a corpse and apparently
dead. The leading medical men of Melbourne were in attendance,
often at a cost of Five Guineas a day, yet she sank lower and
lower. Everything that medical science could suggest was tried ;
even morphia failed to give enough ease for two hours’ sleep
daily. At last, in desperation, some said, “ Try Mesmerism.”
Mr. Harle, as a Mesmerist,
Had been very successful on the public platform, and had also
saved life by private magnetic treatment; but Mrs. Harle, being
a lady of very pronounced opinions and strong mind of her own,
never could see anything in it but a hobby of his, and so, when
urged to try it, she ridiculed the very idea ; but they said, “ Try
it for sleep only— you will go mad for want of rest.” For a long
time she could not bring her mind to submit; at last, after much
prayer to God for guidance and help, she was willing to try.
After about half an hour’s mesmeric influence and passes, she
went off into a peaceful hypnotic state, which lasted, as was
intended, from eight at night till ten next morning; and she
■awoke rested and refreshed. The experiment was repeated, when
Lo! Everyone was Startled
To find that, whilst to all intents and purposes she was asleep, yet in another sense, the mind was far more awake,
and she commenced talking about what the servant was doing on the ground floor, what an acquaintance was doing a
mile away, what was happening in the home of a dear friend some few blocks away,and so forth. Then she was
requested to look into her own body ; this she did, and was surprised herself, and surprised everyone else, by tracing
the cause of her trouble, which proved to be mainly an internal cancer. She then told them how to cure her,
Crowds of Friends Came to See Her,
For she had a large and influential circle of acquaintances. She astounded all by her marvellous powers of vision
to see into their bodies as if they were made of transparent glass, to see the members of their families, to know all
about their commercial affairs, seemed quite easy to her ; England, America, New Zealand, etc., seemed just like next
door.
The Sensation was Immense t
Drawing-room, Sitting-room, Dining-room and Bedroom were crowded with inquisitive people, and the invalid became
a phenomenon. The doctors were nonplussed with their patient— she gave directions how to soften the cancer to the
lancing state: this was done ; then, as they dare not give chloroform on account of her heart, Mr. Harle pul her under
mesmerism, whilst Drs. Teague, of Collins Street, lanced it. She awoke without having felt anything that had hap-
pened. Everyone said: “ Start and use your powers for doing good, you can
Save Lives by Thousands.”
But her health was too low. First, she cured herself—in three months’time she was again taking her accustomed
drives on the Esplanade, in her phseton, to the astonishment of the whole district. To properly tone the system a
change of climate was needed, and she came to N.S. Wales. For a short time she resided in Maitland ; her retreat
was known by those who were aware of her powers, and she got no peace till she agreed to start practice. Five years
ago Mrs. Harle opened in Newcastle ; three years out of the five have been spent travelling in the Northern district,
and away in the bush discovering gold mines, and she seems to be able to find gold as easy as trace disease.
Seven Thousand People Have Consulted Her
In her mesmeric state ; some about business, but most about their health. Not one can say ;“I am worse for your
treatment,” whilst all who have followed the advice and treatment, rejoice in restored health. Mrs. Harle describes
each diseased organ, finds the cause of every trouble, and prescribes remedies and treatment. Her wonderful mental
vision or clear sight enables her to see just what medicine, and how long it will take to Cure it, often giving the
medicine three months ahead, and never changing a bottle.
Warning! (
If you wish to mortally offend Mrs. Harle, just class her along with the card-reading, palm-scanning, fortune-telling
crowd, and the task is done. No such rubbish ! Mrs. Harle is mesmerised by her husband, and when in the hypnotic
state, she sees with her mind. She cannot open her eyes, yet she hears, talks, asks and answers questions, etc. When
the mesmerism is undone, she awakes, and know's no more of what has happened, than if she had been chloroformed
or dead.
It Causes a Terrible Mental Strain,
Therefore, Mr. Harle reserves the right to say when she has done enough, and may refuse any or all at such times.
The Fee is half-a-guinea for bodily examination, and a guinea for business advice. The half-guinea includes a
complete tracing of your case, and a full statement of bow to cure you. Business men have voluntarily paid as high as
£5, and even £l5, for the arrangement of a business tangle. She guarantees in all cases a full value in the treatment,
and more satisfaction all round than can possibly be obtained by any other means whatever. Special medicine is
prepared for each case treated. Mrs. Harle is prepared to work with the family physician or any qualified medical
man, if her suggestions are carried out. She is prepared to treat any case that can be cured, but insists upon only
using her Eclectic Botanic Remedies-she has no faith in mineral medicines. It is desirable to make appointments or
come early in the day, whilst her brain power is fresh. Outdoor visits must also be arranged.
Simple cases send £1; Complicated Cases send £5 —with age, sex, occupation, all symptoms, particularly state of
bowels, how long suffering, and a Photo., if you have one (we will return it) and you will receive post or rail free a
course of Mrs. Harle’s latest marvellous remedies and her personal care of your case—with full advice on diet and
exercise, &c.
P.S.—Mrs. Harle’s chief reason for visiting Sydney for some six months is lo introduce her Remedies to the
Public, and open a Dispensary where people may' call and see her or write for the Remedies or call for them.

It looks bad when Salisbury expresses

Father Sullivan, reckoned the most
eloquent priest in London, very effective in pro-
curing ’verts, has followed Hyacinthe’s example,

The Gympie (Q.) magistrates have fined a
human monstrosity 20s. for hanging his stepson
up by the hands and flogging him on his naked

remarkable a monstrosity as the defendant him-
self.
Sana Croker, for whose alleged murder at
Auvergne station a half-caste now awaits trial at
Port Darwin, was one of the very best N.T.
bushmen. He first went there with the veteran
Nat Buchanan, in ’77. Buchanan, he, and a
little black-boy crossed from the Georgina to
Tennent’s Creek on the Overland Line—they were
the first white men to cross that tract. The creek
they first struck, and which stood by them a long
way, was known as “Buchanan’s Creek” for
years, until the S.A. surveyors came up there,
when it was dubbed “ The Playford.” Poor Sam
was a rattling good fellow, and had done a lot of
hard outside work in settling that part.
The late James M‘Culloch was the third
party in the oft-told story about Macßain and
his frivolous acquaintance. The frivolous one,
coming across M’Culloch in Oollins-street, Mel-
bourne, observed; “Look here, Sir James, just
now I met Macßain coming down the steps of
Parliament House, and said, ‘ All hail ! Mac-
Bain,’ but he just stared at me and said, ‘ It’s all
hail! Macbeth, I’m thinkin’. Now, was there
ever such a man?’” M'Culloch stared at the
would-be joker, just as Macßain had stared at
him, and replied, “Weel, I'm thinkin’ he was
no so verra far wrung.” And solemnly the knight
passed on. He was the typical hard-shell Scotch-
man who would like to have all jokes, save
Scotchmen’s jokes, suppressed by the Legislature.
That ancient, respectable, old Tory,
“ Civis,” writes to the S.M. Herald to insinuate
that the N.S.W. Labour-members can’t possibly
be serious in their opposition to the coloured
hawker nuisance, because the patrons of the
Asiatic traders are mostly the wives of the work-
ing classes, and, therefore, the said members —if
they were serious—have only to “ teach ” them
not to deal with the objectionable heathen, and
the evil will vanish. Why not apply the theory
all round ? On the same basis the anti-liquor and
social purity brigades, and the people who want
to protect property by legislation, and the people
who make laws against bogus banks and burglary
can’t be serious, else, instead of making laws, they
would “ teach ” the people not to drink or thieve
or run dishonest banks, or be disrespectful to
property-holders. For that matter, can anybody
be serious according to “ Civis’ ” argument ?'
The opinions of the Patterson (Vic.)
Cabinet : Premier Patterson favours “economy,”
plural voting, and the suppression of trades-
unionism—a big, ignorant, vociferous man of the
Josiah Bounderby variety; Treasurer Carter,
ditto, but less vociferous; Minister of Edu-
cation Campbell, ditto, but wants an income-
tax to which Patterson and Carter are opposed ;
O’Loghlen wants ©ne-man-one-vote, wants to
borrow <£10,000,000, or more if it can be got, to
build railways everywhere, and leave the bill to
postherity—a gentlemanly individual, and anxious
to abolish things in general, also desires to have a
no-confidence motion once a week for “ divarsion
Webb wants plural voting, land and absentee
taxes, apparently the only land-taxer in the
Cabinet; MTntyre, a tired old Scotchman,
wants plural voting, and desires to try some wild
experiments in taxation; M'Coll and Isaacs,
plural voters and cast-iron Conservatives. Four
“ honorary Ministers ” with no portfolios, no
salaries, and no influence, form the “ tail.”
The prosecution for indecency instituted
by the Queensland Government against the
Worker, which lately published a picture en-
titled “Queensland and the Vampire,” repre-
senting the Q.N. Bank as a vampire attacking
a semi - nude female, Queensland, is merely
another illustration of the hypocrisy which
lias all along characterised the present Northern
gang-in-office. While it must freely be ad-
mitted that the drawing in question was very
coarse —in the sense of roughness—and inartistic
and susceptible of a questionable interpretation
by any one who, disregarding the context, deli-
berately chose such an interpretation, the per-
fectly legitimate object of the artist must bo
quite obvious to any impartial mind. Inde-
cency ! It is a good word to conjure with among
the whited sepulchres who have stripped Queens-
land naked and thrown her to the Kanakas. But
just think of the Grjffithian gang talking about
“ indecency ” ! —the gang who are month by month
importing to Australia for the sake of gain hun-
dreds of black savages in the proportion of not
more than one or two women to fifty men, and
returning such as survive to their native islands
rotten with the foulest of diseases !

“Sweetheart:” A Sketch Behind the
Counter.
[FOR THE BULLETIN .]
I'hey went crowding and pushing into the
manager’s little glass-room—all sorts and condi-
tions of girls brought there by the advertisement,
“Wanted, attractive young lady for fancy
counter : Behemoth Bros., 10 o’clock sharp.”
It was not One of the fashionable Sydney shops;
it was a “ people’s ” shop where there were always
“sensational sales,” “ alarming sacrifices,” and so
on. A tall, stylish girl-applicant looked around
her dubiously at the great heaps of soiled drapery
outside, the shabby-fine assistants, the pretentious
tickets —then shook her head and told the young
manager Who spoke to her that the wages were not
high enough.
His eyes swept over the other girls and were
caught by a glitter as of gold in that dusky room.
“ I didn’t say a child,” he said, half quizzically,
and looking down into a small face set in a
wondrous flux of shining hair.
“I’m sixteen,” the girl looked up eagerly, “I’ll
be seventeen in seven months, and I’m first-rate
at selling things.”
Hfe looked at her more attentively, talked to
her a little, and finally, to the surprise of the
others, told her she might try the place —all the
rest could go.
The small face glanced up at him gratefully.
“ What sort of things shall I sell ? Pretty ones ?
I do love colours and that.”
“ You’ll have to be very hardworking and speak
pleasantly to customers, you know,” he said,
“and be veiy careful with your bills.”
“ Oh, yes 1” She took off her hat in a business-
like way, and he stared again at the mass of
wonderful gold hair that tumbled riotously over
her slight,young shoulders and made a halo for
the bright face.
“I’ll do it up if you like,” she said, noticing he
was looking at it, “only it’s rather heavy—still,
it icould make me look older.”
“Never mind; it looks all right,” he said,
slowly. “ What’s your name; you didn’t tell
me?”
“Sweetheart,” she returned, easily, as she rolled
a pair of small, shabby gloves into a ball.
“But your other name?” he said. “You
wouldn’t like everyone here to call you that.”
“Oh* yes. Why, I don’t think I’ve been called
by my proper name twice in my life. Do you
know, even in the pantomime bills at Christinas
they put me down “ Miss Sweetheart.”
“ Pantomime?” he said.
A look of pride crossed the little, fair face. “ I’ve
been on the stage since I was seven—it’s only in
off-times I do anything else.”
The head of the shop came in just then—the
manager was his eldest son—and he looked
approvingly at the new assistant as she went to
be initiated into her new duties.
“She ought to suit,” he said, rubbing his hands
softly together. “ I’ve found, from long experi-
ence, Harry, there’s nothing like a pretty face at
the fancy counter at uight, when the men come i>’
to look round.”
“Hm 1” said Hariy, doubtfully.
As the days went on Sweetheart undoubtedly
“drew.” She had a round counter set out with
all manner of pretty trifles, and, in the midst, just
room for her to move about.
Women, as well as men, seemed to drift as a
matter of course to that counter, just, it seemed,
to catch a glimpse of the childish, eage'r face with
its laughing eyes and shiinmery hair; to hear the
little babbling laugh afid constant merry jesting
yon would have thought selling bottles of doubtful
scent and cakes of highly-coloured soap must be
the pleasantest work in life.
The Utbl slighfc figuro that had been hung with
glittering, gauzy wings from all kinds of impos-
sible places on the stage, that had danced airily
tipmost toe, and been a butterfly, a humming-
bird> or ;in ange i ; a 8 t he exigencies of pantomime
demanded, was now the delight of all in that
g reat shop,
Even the assistants of her own sex took kindly
to her, though she deprived them of a great
amouilt of admiration that had formerly fallen to
their share ; she was so small and delicate that it
see med natural to pet her. The colour that so often
burned in her cheeks they felt instinctively was
not that of healt , and fchev tried to save her work
in all ki „ds of good-natured ways. In return,
she woukl danee for them in the big packing-room
at lunch tim b them off fineB or dismissals
from the manager, trim their hats with her clever
fin alld ket .p them all alive with her in-
feeti(ms i anghter and iuerry nonsense. And they
all called her “ Sweetheart ”—all but a man at the
calico counter, a great ungainly fellow with
reddish hajr and brown eyes soft as a woman’s. I
cWt think the girl wou f d 6V er have given him a
second glance but that he called her “ Miss—er —
fir » in a humb | e way on the few occasions he
spoke to her, and once she had surprised a look of
absolute worship in his honest, deep-set eyes.
She know quite we]l wliat
glances of worship were
_ t his child of IG. What else was it she saw in
the faces of the theatre “ supers ” she had known
so lo of the u men at the various counters,
of tbe two ', r three she epis h young fellows
who bouß ht a cake of soap or a tooth-brush each
evening with unfailing regularity? They had
been as the salt of life to her ever since she was a
child of ten, and she revelled in them in a glad,
pro ud, childish way.
~ , ~ «, c ~ , , , „ .
Kut the smiles of the world had been sufficient
uithento; it was only very lately that she had
grown heedless of them and begun to care for an
individual one only. Poor little Sweetheart !
Before be even asked for it, before he was quite
sure he wanted it, she had given all her heart over
to ™* e Kood-looking_ young manager who had
6 n " a o e( 3 |] er - Sometimes she would keep aw is t-
*u ey . e c ire ?^ ed towards his glass-room half the
’Horning and be silent and distrait, then perhaps
I 1 , 6 wou c come out and speak to her awhile about
the arrangement of her goods or such trifles, and
I'h® brilliant smile and dimples would flash back
l nto 'her face and her heart would sing with sheer
joy for the rest of the day.
They thought they would warn her once—some
good-natured girls who saw how things were going
with their little fellow-worker, grown suddenly
quiet and thoughtful.
“He’s engaged, Sweetheart, to a fine young
l af iy that comes shopping here sometimes ; her
P a ’ s rich, an alderman, and no end, and she’s to
huy a big share in the business.”
Sweetheart’s face paled piteously.
“I d-don’t care—what does it matter to me ? ”
she said with a little gasp.
“ Only don’t go and take notice of his fine words
a,, d looks, they warned.
She went back to her place and twisted her
small, thin hands together in an odd, light way
under the counter.
“ He shouldn’t look so, ” she said to herself again
and again, and her breast heaved. “Oh, he
shouldn’t look so.”
He came down the shop presently and stood by
her counter. “ You're nearly out of soap, Sweet-
heart; I must send you a box.” There was the
old, tender look in his eyes.
“ Y-yes,” she said in a frightened way.
“Sweetheart, wait for me to-night by the second
door.”
“No,” she said in a whisper, and arranged the
toothbrushes with a sick throb at her heart.
He looked at her steadily. “ Sweetheart —little
girl—why not? What have I done? ”
“ I can’t,” she said faintly, and the colour leapt
up to her brow again.
He turned and went back to his room, while the
girl cast an imploring look at his retreating back.
Of course she was there when he came out at
8 o’clock—half hidden by the shadow at the
door, and trembling and flushing like the silly
child she was. They went into Hyde Park as
they had done twice before.
“ They said you were engaged,” she said, catch-
ing at his coat-sleeve in a little, miserable way.
He took her in his arms and showered kisses on
the soft, quivering lips, the wet, sweet eyes and
wind-blown hair. “I am, Sweetheart,” he said at
last, and put her from his arms, but she crept
back.
“ I—loved you ; oh. how I loved you ! ’’ she
said, with a burst of childish sobs.
He kissed her again and again, then dropped
his arms to his sides and groaned. He was not
altogether bad, this dark-eyed young manager,
only weak and thoughtless, and she was so pretty.
“Don’t, you know I have to marry her—the
firm’s nearly broke, my mother and sisters would
be penniless—there’s no other way.”
She only gave a little, bitter cry and put her
hands over her face.
“But I love you, Sweetheart —I love you—God
help me, how I love you.” He pulled down her
trembling hands and held them in his own,
stroking them, caressing them in an eager, tender
way. Soon the poor child’s pride came back and
she drew them away with a pathetic air of dignity.
“ I must—go—home,” she said, slowly, and
looking away from him to where Oxford-street
lights blazed beyond the park.
“ Forgive me—oh, Sweetheart, if you knew how
I hate myself—Sweetheart, can you ever forgive
me?” His voice broke, and looking up she saw
his eyes were as wet as her own.
“ Oh, yes,” she said, with a quick-caught breath
as she turned away. “ Oh, yes—it—it doesn’t
matter at all. ”
Chapter 11.
The next week was filled with one of the most
important sales of the year, and everyone was
busy from morning to night. The next, the
young manager was to be married. His fiancee
came to the shop one day and made extensive pur-
chases for her trousseau. Presently she walked
up to the fancy counter and seated herself. Some-
one had whispered to her of Harry’s fancy for the
little assistant, and now her gaze dwelt insolently
on the small face where the colour came and went.
“Soap, and don’t keep me waiting—toilet,
vinegar, and cherry blossom. What a clumsy girl
you are, to be sure !” as Sweetheart’s shaking
hand knocked down half a row of bottles. “ I
shall report that carelessness to the manager.”
Sweetheart stooped down, and, with crimson
face, was gathering up the broken glass, when he
came down the shop with a careworn expression.
“Harry, this girl, out of sheer bad temper,
knocked down those bottles because I complained
of her slowness. However, I suppose you will see
it’s stopped out of her wages.” She gave a vin-
dictive glance from one to the other.
He looked imploringly at Sweetheart. “Oh,
come, Edith, it was an accident of course, Sw ,
this young lady would not do it on purpose.”
Sweetheart had grown suddenly pale and utterly
tired-looking; she sat down and put her hand to
her side with a swift indrawing of breath.
Such affectation ! Harry’s lady-love swept over
to another counter, keeping him dangling beside
her all the time. Soon she found another refine-
ment of torture for her poor little rival. She
sailed into the office of her future father-in-law,
who stood considerably in awe of her. “ I wane
you to let me have a girl to come home with me
and carry my parcels. I can’t wait for the cart.”
“Certainly, my dear, certainly. Miss Smith
will do —I’ll just send for Miss Smith,” he said,
making for the door.
“No, I’ll have that yellow-haired girl at the
fancy counter —just tell her, Harry.”
But Harry had disappeared, and the head him-
self bore the me. l sage to the fancy counter.
Sweetheart came, too startled and dismayed to
disobey. She put on her hat very slowly, and
took up one by one the paper parcels indicated
by the purchaser. There was a band-box to
crown all, and, with a crimson spot on each
cheek, she followed slowiy after her persecutor,
down the long shop, past the unhappy Harry, and
out into the street.
They went about two blocks without speaking,
one girl tall and handsome and with an insolent
look on her face, the other slight and shabby,
with white, set features and tightly shut mouth.
“Don’t walk beside me—keep behind,” said
Arrogance, “and here, you may as well carry my
hand-bag, too.”
But Sweetheart stopped suddenly short, Her
delicate nostrils dilating and her eyes shining,
“What did you say?” said the other girl,
startled for a moment.
But Sweetheart only laid down the parcels one
by one on the pavement jn a goodly pile, tprned
round, and walked rapidly away in another direc-
tion.
She went back to the shop and took her accus-
tomed place without comment at the counter, for
only Harry was there, and he did not dare to
question her.
She had several things to tidy, and it was past
eight o’clock when she put on her hat, and w r ent
down the nearly deserted shop where the lights
were being put out. Harry intercepted her as
she passed his room.
“I’d rather have died than that should have
happened, Sweetheart,” he said passionately.
She only gave a little, tired gesture and went
forward, but he caught her arm.
“Come in here, I want you,” he said, pushing
back his door.
She shook her head.
“Sweetheart, I want you.”
Again she shook her head, but this time her lip
trembled.
He looked round—a man was putting up the
shutters, and they were the only two left in the
place. He just lifted her as he would have lifted
a baby, carried her into his room, and locked the
door behind them.

“I’ll have you for one half-hour before my bell
commences, or die for it,” he said between his
teeth ; “don’t you know I marry that fiend to-
morrow ?”
“ Yes,” she said, with a shiver.
“ Don’t grudge me a few minutes, then, for the
last time, Sweetheart.”
“ No,” she said, and shivered again.
“My darling. God ! what have I done to
deserve this!” his voice broke, and he put his
face down upon the warm, soft hair. She lifted
her face up, slowly, uncertainly—his was wet
with hot tears. The next minute she was clinging
to him, sobbing in a heart-broken, hysterical way,
and he was kissing away his soul upon her. Soon
the clock struck the half-hour.
“ Little Goldenhair,” he whispered, and passed
his hand through the wonderful, shining waves.
He kissed them again and again.
“To think someone else will have the right to
touch it! Sweetheart, how I have loved your
hair.” .
Her scissors were still hanging from her waist.
“ They never shall —it is your hair ; no one else
shall ever touch it !” she whispered with a sob.
Three times her scissors opened and closed, and
all the shining mass fell in soft heaps upon the
floor. Then they clung to each other again in
farewell.
The clock struck the hour, and the girl stood
up white and weary. “What about this?” —she
touched the glittering heaps with her tiny, well-
worn boot. He stooped down, gathered it up
tenderly, and wrapped it in a sheet of paper. “I
shall keep it till I die, Sweetheart,” he said.
Site shook her little shorn head. “ She won’t
let you.”
Ho flushed, for he felt it was true. Then he
unlocked the door, and they went down the dark,
silent shop hand-in-hand as far as the’door.
There their steps diverged, and he went on his
separate life-journey, she on her’s.
I think the man at the calioo-counter —the big,
red-haired fellow with the womanish eyes—had
the worst of it. He married her presently —she
seemed too tired and spiritless to say “No ” —but
someone else had her heart, and someone else the
sweet, bright hair he had loved.
“ It will grow again,” she said to him gently,
when he touched regretfully the short curls on the
little, boyish-looking head.
But it never did. In a few months he was alone
again.

The Letter of Richard Burrows.
(Addressed to the Coroner).
( FOR THE BULLETIN. )
Sir,—Were this letter left unwritten your jury
would probably return the customary verdict of
“suicide whilst of unsound mind.” Now, as a
matter of fact, my brain is singularly free from
kinks. I am prepared for death because I have
just, been introduced to myself and I am disgusted
at the company he keeps.
Let me tell you, firstly, that ten years or so
back I was very fond of alcohol —genuinely fond
of it, mind you. There was never any drinking-
for-the-sake-of-company-only about me. Well,
the best woman in the world was so unfortunate as
to fall in love with me-; principally, I believe,
because she had an accentuated maternal pity for
all weaklings'—physical or moral. I married her
and fur six years I was never intoxicated —for
months at a time I was a total abstainer. I was
proud of the angelic woman and the two innocent
children I possessed. I sneered with my shoulders
at the reckless Bohemians I had known prior to
my marriage. I was the Melbourne prototype of
the arrogant publican of old Judea. I had
caught the disease of self-analysis and was wont
to compare myself with other people in a way
that always showed me the superior.
Yesterday I went out, promising my wife to
return at mid - day with some money for
household expenses. We have, of late, had to
live most economically, but although we have
often reached our last shilling at breakfast-time
our purse has, by whatever desperate expedient of
mine, usually been fairly stocked again by dusk.
On this day there was just sixpence in the house
when I left. You see, do you not, the necessity
for my early return ?
After much trouble I obtained a little money
and started for home. On the, way to the tram I
met two very old, and very dissolute, friends of
mine. I knew that I should have torn myself
from them and hurried home, but the habit that I
hadn’t known for ten years—the old habit of
postponement —somehow visited me in my ex-
hausted state and I asked them to drink.
I have told you that I liked drink? Well, as
soon as I had taken my second dram, I was
absolutely under the dominion of the hprrible
craving within me, awakened now, and stronger
than before it went to sleep.
I reached home that night at half-past eleven,
just nine-and-a-half hours later than the time I
had promised to return.
If she had abused me I don’t think I
should have felt so bad about it. ' But she was
gently reproachful only. Worse than that, she
had actually bought some dinner for me w-ith the
miserable sixpence. Now you see what a contrast
of natures was shown me !
I wish I had never learnt to know myself.
God ! what a mean animal am I! How can I
avoid advising myself to have nothing further to
do with myself?
I looked at my children this morning. Their
souls are so white in comparison with mine that
in their light my black heart casts a shadow. I
think all men are interior to all women and
children. lam so immeasurably inferior to these
of mine that I couldn’t degrade them by living.
My eyes were opened to myself, yesterday, and I
saw mjjself as the brute that I am.
Men can survive the death of love, of friends, of
even the nearest and dearest —but he who can
survive the death of self-respect is no man.
1 have no pity for those who bear fny name and
whom I leave. 1 love" them so well would
drive from them, as I would drive a wolf, the
brutish myself which I saw yesterday.
This death of mine is not suicide—l am killing
a fiend which would destroy, by starvation and
neglect, those whom the man part of me loves
vqry dearly.

RANDOLPH BEDFORD.
The Ancient Drunk.
We had nothing to do as we lounged at the bar,
So we lit on an old-fashioned swjper,
And we said, “ Let us go for this old lah-di-dah
Till we make him as drunk as a piper.”
And the only result we were able to note
Was, hisTnind took a backward direction,
And he told all the boys ho intended to vote
For Maoleay at the coming election.
And he talked of the Barb as the horse of the day,
And the deeds of Black Perry, the fighter,
And the whisky it dwindled and dwindled away
But he'seemed not to geb any tighter.
And the boss of the gang who was standing the
drink
Gurgled out in a manner downhearted :
“ Whalh a use pourin’ grog into (hie) blessed old
sink !
’Es no worsh (hio) than he wash (hie) when he
shtarted.”
So we gave up the,game, And we paid for the grog
As we found we'd been rather tool clever,
And the old fello’w sat like a knot on a log,
And he seemed just as sober as ever.
And we walked on all-fours as we wandered away,
And he mumbled along at his story ;
“Jack Rob’shon’sh no good, an’ I’ll vote for
Macleay. ”
So we left him alone in his glory.

have afforded space to indicate that it was taken

At Port Darwin (N.T.), a man, having an
apparently sore finger bandaged with blood-stained
linen, “was acquitted on a charge of stealing a £5
note, because no money was found on him.
Strutting out of the court he issued a general
“ eumanavadrink.'” Arrived at the bar, he un-
wound his firiger-rags, and, producing the stolen
fiver, triumphantly paid for the liquors.
