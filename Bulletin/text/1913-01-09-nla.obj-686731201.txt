CAUTION. —The large sale for
“Eumerithol JUJUBES” has led to a
number of imitations being manufac-
tured under the name of menthol and
other* jujubes. It is important, there-
fore, when buying to be sure and get
HUDSON’S Eumenthol Jujubes. You
may be asked to buy other jujubes,
and be told they are “just as good” as
Hudson’s Eumenthol Jujubes. This
proves that these imitations and sub-
stitutes have no reputation of their
own, and ca‘n only be sold on the good
repute and high character of Hud-

The Red Rage
A Master of Parody
A Christmas Garland, woven by Max
Beerbolim (Heinemann, per Dymock’s Lib-
rary), should be hung round the neck of
ever acolyte of literature. These parodies
of modern English writers, from Henry
James to John Galsworths 7 , can be classed
only with the famous caricatures of Max.
Not only is the style delightfully parodied
but the very thought of the victim repro-
duced. “Perkins and Mankind” might actu-
ally be an extract from Wells’s next novel.
“Shakespeare and Christmas,” by Frank
Harris, applies that great critic’s logic to a
subject that one almost believes he is about
to make the crux of his next work on
Shakespeare. He has echoed the reverber-
ating emptiness of G. K. Chesterton in pas-<
sages like this :
That it is human to err is admitted by
even the most positive of our thinkers. If
Euclid were alive to-day (and I dare say he
is) he would not say, “The angles at the
base of an isosceles triangle are equal to one
another.” He would say, “To me (a very
frail and fallible being, remember) it does
seem somehow that these two angles have a
mysterious and awful equality to one an-
other.” The dislike of schoolboys for Euclid
is unreasonable in many ways; but funda-
entally it is the revolt from a man who was
either fallible and therefore (in pretending
to infallibility) an impostor, or infallible
and therefore not human.
J*
In “Scruts” Max has written an Arnold
Bennett story that would deceive nine out
of ten library subscribers “It is doubtful,”
Max pauses to refnark, “whether the people
of southern England have even yet realised
how much introspection there is going on all
the time in the Five Towns.” Emily Wrack-
grath is the ideal Bennett heroine: —
She with her own hand had made this pud-
ding. But for her this pudding would not
have been. Fantastic! Utterly incredible!
And yet so it was. She was grown up. She
was mistress of the house. She could make
or unmake puddings at will. And yet she
was Emily Wrackgrath. Which was ab-
surd.... She was the incarnation of the
adorably feminine. She was exquisitely
vital. She exuded at every pore the pathos
of her young undirected force. It is diffi-
cult to write calmly about her. For her, in
another age, ships would have been launched
and cities besieged. But brothers are a race
apart, and blind. It is a fact that Jos would
have been glad to see his sister “settled” —
preferably in one of the other four towns.
Conrad and Henry James, of course, are
easy; but even Galsworthy proves food for
Max’s powder. His delicate prose rhythm
and his uncolored vision present no difficul-
ties to the parodist’s cunning hand. “En-
deavor” —the thin story of a live canary
and a dead robin, has this exquisite dying
close: —
Standing between the live bird and the
dead, they gazed across the river, over the
snow-covered wharves, over the dim, slender
chimneys from which no smoke came, into
the grey-black veil of the distance. And it
seemed to them that the genius of infinity
did not know —perhaps did not e’ven care —
whether they were futile or not, nor how
much and to what purpose, if to any pur-
pose, they must go on striving.

“A Sequelula to ‘The Dynasts,’” by
Thomas Hardy is sheer delight. An extract
does not do this parody justice, but it does
indicate Hardy’s blank verse :
Spirit Sinister: His name?
Recording Angel: One moment. ( Turns
over leaves.)
Hardy, Mr Thomas,
Novelist. Author of “The Woodlanders,”
“B’ar from the Madding Crowd,” “The
Trumpet Major,”
“Tess of the D’Urbevilles,” etcetera,
Etcetera. In 1895
“Jude the Obscure” was published and a few
Hasty reviewers, having to supply
A column for the day of publication,
Filled out their space by saying that there
were
Several passages that might have been
Omitted with advantage. Mr. Hardy ’
Saw that if that w r as so, well, then, of course,
Obviously the only thing to do
Was to Write no more novels, and forthwith
Applied himself to drama....
“Fond Hearts Askew” needs no author’s
name if we but look at the prologue :
Too strong a wine, belike, for some stom-
achs, for there’s honey in it, and a dibbet of
gore, with other condiments. Yet Mistress
Clio (with whom, some say, Mistress Thalia,
that sweet hoyden) brewed it; she, not I,
who do but hand the cup round by her war-
rant and good favor. Her guests, 1 not mine,
you shall take it or leave it —spill it un-
tasted or quaff a bellyful....
£
Often the present writer has said earn-
estly to himself: “I must read Arthur Chris-
topher Benson. It is full time that I read
Benson. What do I know about modern
literature if Benson remains a closed book
to me?” But never the mood and the time
and the Benson came together. And now I
shall never read Benson. For the extract
that Max gives in the Arthur Christopher
Benson manner suffices. Max has told me
all I ever want to know about Benson.
And for climax Max has reprinted his
classic “Euphemia Clashthought,”. by Mere-
dith, with its triumph of Meredithan dia-
logue: —
“It snows,” she murmured, swimming to
the window.
“A flake, no more. The season claims it.”
“I have thin hoots.”
"Another pair?”
“My maid buttons. She is at church.”
“My fingers?”
“Ten on each.”
“Five,” he corrected.
“Buttons.”
“I beg your pardon.”
While Max can do such things as these,
why does he worry about Zuleika Dobsons?
A little thin, a little too nicely written, a
little lacking in red blood is John Gals-
worthy’s collections of studies and essays,
entitled The Inn of Tranquillity (Ileine-
mann). As was suggested by the appear-
ance of Galsworthy’s last play, The Pigeon,
the red corpuscles in this writer’s blood are
being gradually devoured by the phagocytes
of literary style. The Inn of Tranquillity
is too tranquil: the nicely padded chairs
tempt the reader to do2e. In one of his
essays Galsworthy devotes some pages to
the moon, telling us how he chased her
through a wood, and all the time the moon
was “dipping to the rim of the world,” and
always trees intervened. A pretty picture,
but the reader must be pardoned who sees
behind this allegory the picture of a bald-
browed, middle-aged gentleman rushing
madly after the moon, stumbling over roots
and crashing into tree trunks on his foolish
quest. That is the danger of fine writing.
Yet the book must not be overlooked. It is
genuine Galsworthy—in spots, and the spots
are as important to us as the markings on
the planet Mars. In his discussiop of the
drama he has, as may well be expected,
much of interest to say. For instance, his
definition of a good plot, as' “that sure edi-
fice which slowly rises out of the interplay
of circumstance on temperament, and tem-
perament on circumstance, within the enclos-
ing atmosphere of an idea. A human being
is the best plot there is; it may be impos-
sible to see why he is a good plot, because
the idea within which he was brought forth
cannot be fully grasped; but it is plain that
he is a good plot. He is organic. And so
it must be with a good play.” So “true
dramatic action is what characters do, at
once contrary, as it were, to expectation, and
yet because they have already done other
things.” And “Take care of character;
action and dialogue will take care of them-
selves.... The perfect dramatist rounds up
his characters and facts within the ring-
ffnce of a dominant idea which fulfils the
ctaving of his spirit; having got them there,
he suffers them to live their own lives.”
Christmas Poets
A couple of little Christmas poets—Enid
Derham, with The Mountain Road and
other Verses (Osboldstone, Melb.), and M.
.Sweeney, with Melbourne's Armageddon and,
Other 1 ‘ erses (Colonial Press, Melb.; Is.).
Enid Derham is vague and feminine, with
pretty little errant fancies prettily ex-
pressed, and that’s all. She aptly says:—
But for me, I am lapped in dreams
And visions of nothing worth;
and she has this to say to a gum tree: —
Through all thy height
How dost thou blossom, giving back the sun,
Each leaf a light!
Thou unconsumed one,
What joy austere and keen on thee is laid
Through branch and glittering blade
That casts no shade,
When thou at noontide clothed in thy
desire
Dost thrill, a tree of fire!
and hangs upon its unprotesting branches
an apostrophe to her soul. And this she has
to say of “The Moment” :
Nor are we wholly sad, whose moan
Is made for wasted days,
It something comforts to have known
The Rose of desert ways,
A lovely and a fleeting thing
That has no second blossoming.
M. Sweeney is a more bloodthirsty muse.
The climax of “Melbourne’s Armageddon,”
when: —
Melbourne teas as Gomorrah
'Neath Asian command,
A prey to every horror
That haunts a fallen land,
is the awful picture of the last indignity to
Australia by a Japanese conquest:—
The splendid mares and stallions,
'Trained for the “Cup Campaign,”
By the leaders of battalions
y As spoils of war were ta’en.
And blood-red hands did bridle
Trafalgar in his stall;
Australia's equine idol
Had shared the common fall.
But there are better things than this. With
little art, but with some sincerity, he writes
of “Jockeys’ Wives,” when the steeplechas-
ing season is on; he ha.s a pleasant little
“place poem” of “Moonlight in Burwood” ;
and he gives this occasionally six-footed
sonnet on Daley’s “Wine and Roses” :
As some tired reveller, by a wreck-streicn
shore,
Watches ioith wearied eyes the pageantry
Of after-glows upon the sky and sea.
When the sun-god lies beneath the ocean's
floor:
So I o’er Daley’s dainty book did pore:
Feasting my soul ioith rose and red anemone
And sweet, sad echoes of his long Getlise-
mane,
When pain stood sentinel beside his door.
There did I scan no lay of bondless bride,
Nor rapturous rimes of ribald devilry,
But saintly songs for souls by anguish tried,
And sorrow made a sacred thing that men
might see
The wisdom of the sage, in one strong mind
allied,
Through gloom and light to childish purity.
Samuel Butler
According to Shaw, Samuel Butler, the
Canterbury (M.L.) squatter who wrote
Erewhon, and a number of remarkable
scientific and pliildsophical works, was “in his
own department, the greatest English writer
of the latter half of the nineteenth century.”
The man was as remarkable as his work ;
his personality, revealed by the contents of
six volumes of his note-books, left by him
in manuscript at his death in 1902, is that
of a thinker in advance of his age, who dis-
sipated his energies in half a dozen depart-
ments of work. He sums up his own con-
tributions to the thought of his age under 17
heads, ranging from his emphasis of the
analogies between crime and disease (de-
lightfully worked out in ErewhOnJ, “the
tidying up of the earlier history of the
theory of evolution,” the discovery and
identification of certain paintings by
the old masters, and the theory that the
Odyssey was written by a woman, to re-
search into the evidence of the crucifixion of
Christ. His books had but small sales, but
in his note-books —from which Henry Test-
ing Jones has selected material to make one
volume, The Note-Books of Samuel Butler
(Fifield, 6s.) —it is plain that Butler was
sure of his appeal to his immediate posterity.
And he was a true prophet. This volume is
full of brilliant things, thrown out haphazard
from his fertile brain.
From Samuel Butler’s Note-Books
A man is a passing mood coming and
going in the mind of his country; he is the
twitching of a nerve, a smile, a frown, a
thought of shame or honor, as it may hap-
pen.
All progress is based upon a universal in-
nate desire on the part of every organism
to live beyond its income.
1 have squandered my life as a schoolboy
squanders a tip. But then half, or more
than half, the fun a schoolboy gets out of a
tip consists in the mere fact of having some-
thing to squander.
A hen is only* an egg's way of making an-
other egg.... The base of reproduction must
be looked for not in the desire of the parents
to reproduce, but in the discontent of the
germs with their surroundings inside those
parents, and a desire on their part to have
a separate maintenance.
Is life worth living? This is a question
for an embryo, not for a man.
If virtue had everything her own way she
would be as insufferable as dominant fac-
tions generally are. It is the function of
vice to keep virtue within reasonable
bounds.
Morality turns on whether the pleasure
precedes or follows a pain. Thus, it is
immoral to get drunk because the headache
comes after the drinking, but if the head-
ache came first, and the drunkenness after-
wards, it would be moral to get drunk.
All eating is a kind of proselytising—a
kind of dogmatising —a maintaining that the
eater’s way of looking at things is better
than the eatee’s. We convert the or
try to do so, to our own way of thinking,
and, when it sticks to its own opinion and
refuses to be. converted, we say it disagrees
with us. An animal that refuses to let
another eat it has the courage of its convic-
tions, and, if it gets eaten, dies a martyr to
them. So we can only proselytise fresh
meat, the convictions of putrid meat begin
to be too strong for us Cooking is good
because it makes matters easier by unset-
tling the meat’s mind, and preparing it for
new ideas.... Sitting quiet afteF'eating is
akin to sitting still during divine service, so
as not to disturb the congregation. We are
catechising and converting our proselytes,
and there should be no row.
Man is a walking tool-box, manufactory,
workshop and bazaar, worked from behind
the scenes by someone or something that we
never see. We are so used to never seeing
more than the tools, and these work so
smoothly, that we call them the workman
himself, making much the same mistake as
though we should call the saw the carpenter.
The destruction of great works of litera-
ture and art is as necessary for the con-
tinued development of either one or the other
as death is for that of organic life.
We want a Society for the Suppression
of,Erudite Research and the Decent Burial
of the Bast. The ghosts of the dead past
want quite as much laying as raising.
The greatest poets never write poetry.
The Homers and Shakespeares are not the
greatest —they are only the greatest that we
can know. . . .For the highest poetry, whether
in music or literature, is ineffable —-it must
be felt from one person to another, it can
not be articulated.
Versifying is the lowest form of poetry;
and the last thing a great poet will do in
these days is to write-verses.
If you wish to preserve the spirit of a
dead author you must not skin him, stuff
him, and set him up in a case. You must
eat him, digest him and "let him live in you,
with .such life as you have, for better or
worse. The difference between the Andrew
Lang manner of translating the Odyssey and
mine is that between making a mummy and
a baby.
There is no true love short of eating and
consequent assimilation.
The Roman Empire must have died of in-
experience of some kind. I should think most
likely it was puzzled to death by the
Christian religion.
Our own death is a premium which we
must pay for the far greater henefit we have
derived from the fact that so many people
have not only lived, but also died before us.
For if the old ones had not in course of time
gone there would have been no progress; all
our civilisation is duh to the arrangement
whereby no man shall live for ever, and to
this huge mass of advantage we must each
contribute our mite; that is to say, when
our turn comes we too must die.
An apology for the Devil: It must be' re-
membered that we have only heard one side
of the case. God' has written all the books.
A definition is the enclosing a wilderness
of idea within a w 7 all of words.
To put one’s trust in God is only a longer
way of saying that one will chance it.
The reason why the early Christians held
faith in such account was because they felt
it to be a feat of such superhuman difficulty.
A man may have faith as a mountain, but
he will not be able to say to a grain of mus-
tard seed: “Be thou removed, and be thou
cast into the sea” —not at least with any
effect upon the mustard seed —unless lie goes
the right way to work by putting the mus-
tard seed into his pocket and taking the train
to Brighton. • . ,
If Vesuvius does not frighten those who
live under it, is it likely that Hell-fire should
frighten any reasonable person?
A second and revised and enlarged edition
of John Blacket’s History of South Aus-
tralia (Hussey and Gillingham, Adelaide)
has been called for. A special feature of this
edition,is the full account given of the pri-
vate explorations that contributed largely to
the opening up of the country.
Another edition of The Golden Treasury
of Australian Verse, edited by Bertram Ste-
vens (Angus and Robertson, Sydney), adds
three poets to this standard Australasian
anthology —Dorothea Mackellar, J. Steele
Robertson and Charles Henry Souter, all of
whom justify their inclusion.
A Popular Guide to the Wild Flowers of
A T .N.1F., by Florence Sulman, with illustra-
tions by Eirene Mort and Dorothy M. Wat-
kins (Angus aud Robertson, Sydney), sup-
plies a want. The aim of the book is to help
those who wish to know the names and a
little of the history of the wild flowers in
the central coast district and the Dividing
Range of this State.' The book does not
claim to be comprehensive, but nine of the
most' popular families of our wild flowers
are fully described in non-technical language.
As so few of our flowers have vernacular
names —it is time that these were invented
—the flowers are, in most cases, disguised by
their scientific names.
Quite trivial and futile is “Tryphena’s”
story of Stumpy, a Cattle Dog, alleged to
have been told by himself. (Australasian
Authors’ Agency, 12 pages for a shilling.)
In that excellent magazine, The English

land. It is written by the ordinary author
and published by the ordinary publisher, and
attains the ordinary sale of from 200 to 700
copies, some through Jhe booksellers, but
mostly for circulation amongst the long-
suffering subscribers of the libraries. The

Being charged with the duty of assuring the maximum of comfort, at the
least possible expense, she appreciates the advantages of a perfect lighting
system, which is absolutely safe and clean.
SHE KNOWS
that the installation of a gas service means the saving of an untold amount of
work and worry, and, more than anyone else, realises the benefits of having
a gas stove and bath-heater always ready- to help her through the continuous
round of household duties.
The Immense Saving Effected by
QUIRK’S AIR CAS

IMPROVE YOUR FIGURE
W
Every Thin Woman Can he Fully Developed
Every Fat Person Can be Reduced to Normal
FAT PEOPLE. Excess fat
injures your health, impedes
your movements, and makes
you the butt of your unfeel-
ing normal - weight friends.
People who have been fat,
and are now reduced to nor-
mal, think other fat people
ridiculous.
Not alone does excess fat
injure your health and en-
danger your existence, it ab-
solutely destroys your figure
and makes you a ludicrous
sight. Why do you stay fat?
“FATCURE” positively re-
moves excess fat, and will re-
store your spoiled figure to
decent and pleasing propor-
tions, and is always a sure
and lasting cure for obesity
and corpulency. A few doses
improves your breathing won-
derfully, and the course of
treatment will permanently cure you.
Is the only successful and, at the same time,
harmless, fat-reducer that has ever been dis-
covered. Its efficacy has been undeniably de-
monstrated in thousands of successfully treated
cases. It is totally and absolutely non-poison-
ous, and can in no wise work any injury to the
general health ; though it often reduces excess
weight by as much as a pound a day.
THIN WOMEN.
If you are flat-
chested, thin, run
down and scraggly—
even if you never
had a nicely-rounded
bosom, Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-food will build
you up and develop
your figure. Does
your mirror mock you? Flesh-food will remove
the faults in your figure by rounding out and de-
veloping the deficient places. Put up in Tablet
form, it is easy to use and pleasant to take, and,
if desired, may be taken secretly. Taken under
our directions, it will work wonders for your ap-
pearance. Results guaranteed in every case ac-
cepted.
In many cases bust measurements have been
increased by over ten inches, and the weight
over five pounds weekly. Other cases have
shown an increase in weight of even a pound a
day. The average bust increase desired is about
six inches, and’is readily accomplished.
FLESH-FOOD offers relief and development
to the thousands of chronically thin women who
have despaired of ever possessing a presentable
figure. It is a nerve and tissue food treatment
that adds weight and permanent development to
attenuated women. Thousands endorse it.
LET US SEND YOU A FREE SAMPLE OF EITHER “ FATCURE” or “FLESH-FOOD.”
Send 2d. stamp, and say which remedy you want, and we will send free sample, also free book,
OBESITY to fat people and “BUST” to thin ones. Be sure to say which sample you want.
No matter where you live we can treat you successfully by post. Confidential. Write or call to-day.

At Dusk.
A swirl of swallows, like leaves enskied ;
A far cicada that shrills alone ;
Ihe stealthy steps of the making tide
m,‘ s f As way o’er shell and stone —
hushed night, takes charge of all
a j t - a P^ ane t palely gleaming,
And I give myself to the moment’s thrall
And a quiet while of dreaming.
The reins are loose, and my fancy flies
lo times and scenes that I knew of old—
loto, sweet women with starry eyes
And strong, brave comrades with hearts of
gold ;
To life and motion each mangrove stem
At the touch of the tide is waking—
'' jiat tide, I wonder, has covered them
In the long years slowly making?
the hand that clasped my hand
a 'J h u n seemed empty in life’s wide ken,
And the skies above me are rainbow-spanned
By sweet deeds done by my fellow-men ;
They heartened life when life ailed most
As the dew the green blade blesses—
And n0w.... a wind sighs like a ghost
In the casuarina tresses.
I think of the men who do their best
To smooth the way for their fellow’s feet,
And a vision arises of roses drest
In gold and crimson, with fragrance sweet;
I think of the worthless tribe. . . .and then —
Ah, strange ! now my vision changes
To the stone-piled graves of dead, black men
On the staring Stanley ranges.

The Shell.
Stir in thy depths, O cradling Sea!
Stir some shell from your depths for me,
Sweep it up till it gently lies
Beneath the blue of Australian skies,
A lovely, delicate mystery,
From out the heart of the restless sea.
Peace, my heart! For it draweth near.
Hush ! I lay it against my ear.
Sweetly, lowly, its songs arise,
And tears spring up and dim my eyes.
For the voice of one I loved so well
Speaks once again in the tiny shell.
“The sea has claimed its own,” it sighed,
“But my love still lives, though my body
died.”
My heart cries back in an ecstasy,
“Soul of my soul! Could I pass to thee!
I would follow the Shell to its ocean bed,
And find my Lover among the dead!”

Looking Back.
I am looking back to Sydney with a lover’s
longing eye,
And remembering the hour of our adieu;
And the memories come thronging
In the hunger of that longing
For the day of going back, my Love, to you.
Oh my Love is but a city, in a robe of rolling
hills,
With a skirt of woven waters, silken soft,
Where the jewels gleam and glisten
While the swooning senses listen
To the whispers that the scented breezes
waft.
All the rocks are green and purple in the
girdle at her waist,
And the sands are braided gold about her
knee,
On her bosom’s gentle heaving
Silver wattles now are weaving
Fairy garlands, wonder sweet and fair to
see.
How I love her for the perfume of her breath
of summer seas.
And the honeyed bushland odors in her hair;
And, as much as all, I love her
For sapphire skies above her,
And the balmy, starry nights beyond
compare.
At her wrists, through all the suntime, sound
the steel and silver bells,
Strong and sweet, with youth and vigor,
while she sings;
And, of nights, how fancy lingers
On the vision of her fingers,
Flashing emerald and ruby from her rings.
But the soul of her is strongest to enthral
her willing slave,
True and loyal to the heart that owns her
sway,
That may rove, but cannot waver
From the love that once it gave her ;
And I’m going to her —speed the happy day !

Ship o’ Death.
Ship o’ death, ship o’ death,
The waters are still and white,
And who would think that a chilly breath —-
Who would think that the wings of death
Had ruffled their peace to-night?—
Chilly they are and white.
Ship o’ death, ship o’ death,
Under a wan wet moon,
You have heard the sob of the last hoarse
breath —
You have felt the wind from the wings of
death
Where the mourning surges croon
Under a weeping moon.
Ship o’ death, ship o’ death,
Black on the still, cold sea.
Can you hear the sob on the land wind’s
breath — .
Can you hear the wail from the wind-blown
heath
Shrilled bitterly to me? —
Hark to the mourning sea!
Ship o’ death, ship o’ death,
Swing out to the surges’ tune —
There are broken hearts on a stranger shore,
There are faces bowed that look out no more
From a land that fades so soon
Under a weeping moon.

Motor Lorries
The question of certain and rapid carriage is one of the most vital
matters of modern business. The “Commer” Motor Lorry answers the
question in the best and surest way.
It means more rapid transport. This ensures the benefit and con-
venience of the merchant or carrier and the pleasing of the customer.
It means, by the same feature of increased speed, the enlarging of
the business radius. W ith a wider sphere of action the volume of
business is necessarily increased.
Capacity: 1 Ton to 7 Tons.
The “Commer” is specially adapted to the needs of Australian business and
transport, the natural conditions —such as droughty, waterless stretches, and
rough and hilly country—which offer impediment and often stagnation to horse
teams, fail to obstruct the “Commer.” Its usefulness is increased by the conditions
which are disadvantageous to horse-traction.

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to The Bulletin would oblige the
paper fund, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, Tim Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.’’ Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

THE SERVANT WHO IS GREATER
THAN HIS LORD.
Thomas Carlyle once said that the child
who owned sixpence was master of the world
to the extent of the value of that coin. The
statement is a wicked falsehood. All state-
ments about ownership are falsehoods. It
is to be doubted whether even in the fabled
Golden Age anybody ever really owned
much; it is certain that under neither auto-
cracy nor democracy anybody owns anything
—-even his own soul, if he has one. The
theory of democracy helps the public to be-
lieve that it really owns those conveniences
and branches of the Government service that
stand in its name. John Smith, as a mem-
ber of the public, is under the impression
that he owns the Post Office. What are the
actual facts? Let John go to the Post
Office officials with liis complaint about the
letter which was delivered six days after it
should have arrived, and observe what hap-
pens. Theoretically, he should advance
upon the postmaster with the proud and
assured step of an owner, and demand of
him an immediate explanation of his per-
sonal neglect. The postmaster should be
duly humble and apologetic, and while assur-
ing him that the trouble would not recur,
beg Mr. Smith to take no notice of his
offence this time on account of his wife and
children at home. But nothing of this kind
happens. Mr. Smith meets a proud official
of tenth or twentieth rank in the service,
who looks coldly upon him, and informs him
that, while the service is conducted with due
regard to the needs of the public, it is quite
impossible to accept responsibility for such
delays as may occur at a busy season. John
finds that his alleged ownership does not
amount to a row of fly-bitten tomatoes, and
that instead of speaking as a master to a
servant he must approach the person he
employs with bated breath and whispering
earnestness, and swallow any little official
insults in which the great one may see fit to
indulge. Yet the Post Office is a compara-
tively inoffensive branch of the public ser-
vice. The guardianship of the peace is
handed over to the police, and John Smith
contributes his quota to the screw of every
hobby on his beat. Nevertheless, John
Smith, perfectly innocent of crime or
offence, may be touched on the shoulder by
his blundering servant in blue with a “Come
along now, my man,” which is the very
height of ignominy.
Democracy, says a big American author-
ity, gives every man the right to be his own
oppressor. It goes much further and hands
over to whole classes of men the right to op-
press every other class of men. There ■ is
something thoroughly British and moder-
ately Australian about the ability to endure
patiently all sorts of minor oppression, and
it is an ability which gets_ any amount of
room and scope for exercise. The very
ticket-collectors on the trains and the tram-
guards on the murderous caravans of our
city streets treat us with haughty contempt,
and between breakfast time and dinner we
pocket enough slights, insults and petty
affronts to make a Malay run amok or an
advanced patriot turn anarchist. Civilisa-
tion is supposed to mean living by law, but
into the administration of law —which in-
cludes by-laws, rules, regulations and offi-
cial customs —there enters a personal ele-
ment which is itself as lawless as the dig-
nity of upholding its job demands. Now and
again, when a Fat man thinks that some-
one is going to put his hand in his purse,
some vague talk is heard about the liberty
of the subject, and wild persons get up and
prance on platforms emitting peculiar howls
about the cause of freedom and the like; but
the liberty of the subject is a myth and a
phantasy, also a snare and a delusion, and
officialdom is as strong as death and as
heavy upon the public chest as a nightmare
with a cow as the chief performer.
Through all our modern democracy runs
this bane of officialdom. The servant of the
State is its master, and the individual, in-
stead of withering as the poet said he. ought
to, is more in evidence than ever. It is per-
fectly true that one section of officialdom
makes the other sections eat dirt or some
other humble substance when it gets them
into its own sphere. Thus, the tram-con-
ductor is equally lord over the Judge, the
uostmaster and John Smith (the mere
finder of official screws) as long as he has
them in his jiggering and overcrowded car;
but the Judge and the postmaster will get
back with interest on the tram-conductor
when he comes within the circle of their
power, while John Smith can’t get back
on any of them. His business is simply to
pay, be addressed on special occasions as
the free and independent elector, and accept
as much insult as. his own servants find
time to deliver to him. In a perfect social-
istic State, where everybody was . a public
servant, things would to a certain extent
equalise themselves, for everybody would eet
his chance some time to play tne official,
hut as things are at present the average
citizen has precious little of the joys of
ownership and all their responsibilities.
Nowhere are these relations between
master and servant more noticeable than in
connection with those positions of public
service which are highest of all. By their
votes the citizens of Australia select certain
persons to do their legislative work, and to
some of these falls the duty of administering
the business of the country. While these
men are seeking the support at the ballot-
box which alone can lift them to place and
office, their humility is a thing beautiful to
behold; but the moment they are securely
seated in the positions they covet, they are
said to be in “power,” and the will of John
Smith and his mates who set them . there
ceases to have any weight. An old Scripture
has it that the servant is not above his
lord, but in the realm of politics matters
are reversed', and the servant is so com-
pletely independent of his employer that he
does as he pleases—which is just about no-
thing at all. Barren sessions follow one
another with disappointing regularity, and
the things the people, who are the supposed
masters of the situation, look for and ex-
pect to be done are either not done, or done
in a slow, painful and unsatisfactory man-
ner.
Yet it is comparatively easy to rectify the
matter and make the people really masters
of the position, compelling their servants to
do their will. Direct popular legislation
can be secured by an extension of the Re-
ferendum principle to include what is known
as the Initiative. Under this system a Re-
ferendum on any question can be demanded
by a certain number of electors and must
be held forthwith, and on the question being
carried at the polls, the Ministry and Par-
liament have a direct mandate to make the
will of the people law within a given num-
ber of days. Such a mode of legislation is
the natural conclusion towards which demo-
cracy works. Its adoption involves no con-
fusion of purpose, no interference with
settled order, no greater expenditure of pub-
lic time and money than under our present
system of useless talk and unproductive
shuffle, and through its introduction the public
would possess the direct power which is the
necessary corollary of direct responsibility.
Nobody 'is satisfied with things as they are,
and probably nobody ever will or ought to
be satisfied with anything. But from the
muddle, blither and absurdity of the thing
we call politics, the Referendum with Initi-
ative offers a reasonable and convenient way
out. Also, there is fair ground for the sus-
picion that if John Smith were really
master in Australia, this continent would
not need to pray so long or so hard for for-
giveness for the things left undone which
ought to have been done.
MR. SUBBUBS VISITS BRITAIN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I picked up my Matutinal Blitheber
the other day, and, under the headings: —
WHAT THEY THINK OF US ABROAD.
A SYDNEY BUSINESS MAN’S EXPERIENCES.
I encountered the following :
“Yes,” said Mr. Subbubs, ex-alderman of Broke-
ville, and a partner in the firm of Subbubs and
Snortte, hide merchants, in answer to a query by
our representative, “My trip to Europe, the first
that I have had the good fortune to make, has been
both enjoyable and instructive. I explored London
thoroughly, and, being interested in municipal mat-
ters, made it my business, wherever possible, to get
into touch with the City Fathers and ascertain from
them the feeling at the Mansion House in regard to
the recent development of Sydney and Melbourne.
“I met various prominent financiers and gentlemen
notable in the social and professional worlds of Eng-
land. They paid me the utmost courtesy on learn-
ing that I was from Australia. They were unani-
mously of the opinion that Australia was a land of
vast possibilities (I quote the exact phrase used), but
that capital was being driven abroad, owing to rash
and experimental Labor legislation.
“The eviction of the Governor-General was every-
where spoken of in terms of severe reprobation. Such
Britishers as discussed the unhappy affair with me
took the point that a Government which had so
acted must necessarily be disloyal, and they expressed
the sincere hope that Mr. Wade would be given a
fresh lease of power at the forthcoming elections, thus
demonstrating to the Empire that, at heart N. S.
Wales was still solidly behind the Flag and the Royal
Family. I assured them warmly that this was the
aspiration of every right-thinking man, woman and
child in the Mother State, at which news they ap-
peared considerably relieved.
“Our Defence system strikes the best type of think-
ing Englishman as rotten to the core. The English-
man’s immemorial heritage of freedom from anything
in the nature of conscription (it is now close upon a
century since the navy was recruited by means of
press-gangs) causes him to be utterly revolted at our
compulsory service scheme. At the Australian navy
idea, he openly scoffs. ‘Why not,’ asks the cultivated
Britisher, ‘continue to subsidise British ships, since
the fate of Australia will be settled in the North
Sea ?’ I had no words of excuse to offer.
“Everywhere throughout my travels I found that
the Labor party was in bad odor, and that the sub-
versive legislation of the Socialists had alienated both
sympathy and trust. Staying at my hotel was a
capitalist who had despatched the first instalment of
.£1,500,000 to Australia (his idea being to start a
vast industry in Victoria), when the news of the
Fisher Government’s Maternity' Bonus proposals
reached London. My friend immediately invested his
money elsewhere, and recalled the sum already sent.
Thus is capital being:.lost to the Commonwealth daily,
through the demented antics of Labor.”
Mr. Subbubs smiled with quiet contempt at the
suggestion that Britain’s material prosperity was on
the wane. “The wealth of the country,” he said,
“is incredible. The restaurants, the hotels, the
theatres, the thousands of luxurious motor-cars and
other equipages all bespeak immense affluence. Dur-
ing the whole of my stay in London I hardly saw
one really poverty-stricken person. So much for those
who decry the fiscal doctrine which has made England
what she is.”
Which of us hasn’t struck that, or its
twin brother, many scores of times in one
or other of our great Freetrade and anti-
Socialistic dailies? The impudent old fake
carries little weight with the discerning, but
amongst those who know neither Britain
nor Subbubs it is taken quite seriously,
and, in fact, is used as the text for many a
platitudinous discourse on political subjects.
The bald, drab truth in regard to the ex-
periences of the globe-trotting Australian
business man is never published. It would
be too dull. Besides, it wouldn’t convey a
useful Moral Lesson. In the sacred inter-
ests of Veracity, I accordingly supply, here-
with, a condensed account of the actual
doings of Subbubs in foreign parts, together
with the most significant and vital comments
on local affairs garnered by him during his
wanderings. Subbubs, in the following, is
understood to be on his oath not to lie, brag,
swank, exaggerate or embroider in any
fashion whatsoever: —
The wife and I went to England on the mail
ship Chowcoolia. There was a large assortment of
marquises, earls, Anglo-Indian officials, British, officers
and affluent squatters and their female belongings on
board. None of them seemed disposed to discuss poli-
tical matters, or, indeed, to have anything whatever
to do with me or mine.
Happening to come in contact with Major-General
Gore. V.C. —in my capacity of member of the ship-
board Sports Committee —I ventured a few words in
denunciation of McGowen. He replied absently: “Oh,
yaas! The boy who put it over Johnnie Summers
at the National Sporting Club last year. Now,
how would he stand with one o’ the top-hole welter-
weights—a feller of the class of, say, Lewis?” Be-
fore I could explain to him the grotesque error into
which he had fallen, he had wandered into the smok-
ing-room and become absorbed in a game of picquet.
The only other political discussion 1 had was with
young Lord Blanky. He was a cricketer, 1 the
vessel’s honorary scorer, and so we met. I deplored
the Socialistic ways of the Australian Government.
To my amazement, he literally snorted in scornful
dissent: “Socialism!” he cried. “Why, your poli-
ticians of the Fisher stamp don’t know what the
word means. They’re harmless, necessary bourgeois
.—no more Socialists, on their performances, than
Asquith is or Gladstone was.” He then proceeded
to voice a collection of revolutionary doctrines which
would assuredly have got him black-balled in any
reputable suburban golf club in Australia. It trans-
pired that he had been one of the ultra-progressives
of the Oxford Union some years earlier.
Arrived in London, I went to the Talbot Hotel,
Norfolk-street, Strand —a modest establishment with
an inclusive tariff of £4 4s. per week. Neither the
wife nor I knew anyone of social or financial prom-
inence in London—she having been born a Symthe,
of Pyrmont, and not having left that fair bailiwick
till our marriage, and I having spent the whole of
my adult years in the hide business. The prominent
persons whom he had met on the Chowcoolia unani-
mously failed to recognise us in ,qur London clothes.
Despite the fact that I called on our High Commis-
sioner and on all the Agent-Generals, and left cards
in accordance with the instructions given in “Blight’s
Etiquette Book” (sth edition, price Is. 3d.), I was
not elected an honorary member of the Carlton, the
Athenaeum, the Travellers’ or any of the clubs where
thinking persons are understood to foregather and
discuss the problems of Emnire. The consequence
was I found it extremely difficult to discover what
the views of the people who really mattered were iff
regard to Australia.
While writing in the hotel smoking-room one after-
noon, I was addressed by a gentleman who turned Out
to be an ex-Volunteer officer of one of the old London
companies, now extinct. He animadverted severely on
Australia’s Defence system—in fact, he cursed it.
“Here,” he shouted angrily, “is a scheme under
which the flower of the nation are seized on in their
prime, cooped up for years in barracks, while those
dependent on them starve, perhaps, or go to the
workhouse —and all because a parcel of godless, im-
moral, absinthe-drinking foreign nations do the same.
The thing’s not only uneconomical, sir ; it’s un-
English ; and, by Heaven, Australia will live to rue
the day she took it on. Cumunavadrink ! ” In the
bar I strove earnestly to convince him that he had
somewhat misjudged the Commonwealth system of
compulsory service. In vain. Short, sharp, militarv
barks of “Con=criptionists!” “Disloyalists!” “Pro-
Boers!” “Anti-Imperialists!” were all I could get
out of him. On the eviction question, which I raised
at a later stage, he appeared somewhat hazy. “Den-
man ! Who’s Denman?” he inquired. I explained
that the wronged nobleman was our recently-appointed
Governor-General. Suddenly a light broke in on him
“Denman, a damned Radical, appointed by those
scoundrels, Lloyd-George, Churchill and co.!
Evicted him, did they? Good! It’s a cursed pity
they didn’t court-martial him as well, and shoot him
for an infernal disloyalist and Empire-burster. That
was our way, in the old London Scottish, with Radi-
cals and such like dogs—first evict ’em, then the
gallows or the triangles! ’Avunutherdrink.” But
things were growing too uproarious, and I left.
During the whole of our three months’ stay in the
old country, neither the wife nor I encountered one
English man or woman who had what I should call
even a glimmering of information as regards Aus-
tralian conditions. My wife's acquaintances mostly
asked vaguely if the language was difficult to learn
and if Mrs. Smith, a little, fair-haired woman in a
check tailor-made dress, who went to the colony in
’97, was quite well. One lady asked us if we
would mind sending her “some typical examples of
the peasants’ handiwork” to add to a collection she
was making. A gentleman in my own line of busi-
ness, whom I met in Bradford, thought that G. If.
Reid was still “Premier of Australia,” and that Mr.
Deakin was the leader of the Anarchist party. The
story of the Six Hatters had but recently reached
him, and he was under the mistaken impression that
all aliens who landed on Australian soil were
pushed back into the sea and drowned. Speaking for
the people I met, I should say that in 99 p.c. of
cases, British opinion, in regard to the Common-
wealth, is neither favorable nor otherwise ; it is sim-
ply non-existent.
During the time I was in London, I did not go fur-
ther East than Liverpool-street station, while most of
mv holiday was spent exploring the West End. I
l ave heard it said that there are slums on the South
Side of the Thames wherein women work 12 hours a
day for 3s. 6d. per week ; also, that in thousands of
purlieus off the Mile End Road and similar thorough-
fares it is possible to find as many as three families
inhabiting one 20ft. x 16ft. room. These people would
presumably form portion of the 134 millions who are
reputed to be chronically starving or on the verge of
starvation. For my part, J never saw them, and
what the eye doesn’t discern the somewhat unimagin-
ative heart of the hide-merchant does not grieve over.
I landed at Circular Qua” this morning, and am
glad to be hack home again. It is an immense relief,
for one thing, to be once more amongst understanding
folks who know, and are interested in, all the dear
old gags about the menace of Socialism, the insanity
of local Defence, the capital-scaring effects of Labor,
etc., etc.—gags which the average Briton has no
more partiality for than he has for Choctaw or
prussic acid.
Here are two widely divergent pictures, and
which of them is the truer? If (as I think)
the second one is. and that the local Sub-
bubs does not collogue familiarly when he
is abroad with Asquiths, Balfours,
Rothschilds and such-like representative
men, but associates rather with his own
type (i.e., futile little mediocrities devoid of
either ideas or education), is the tiresome
braggart worth taking any notice of when
he next breaks out in the daily press?
HENRI SINGEMOINE.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Codlin-Moth Politics of the Apple
Speck.
Solomon, of Tasmania, having just squeezed
into recess with the loss of his Cameron
tail, announces an immediate dissolution and
a general election. Two by-elections, with
the odds against the local Liberals, were im-
minent, and the vagaries of the Hare-
Clark electoral system are such that a gen-
eral election was judged to be less risky to
the Government’s majority of two than by-
elections in the two electorates referred to —-
Bass and Denison. Bakhap, one of the
Lib. members for Bass, is up for the
Senate; and ex-Premier Lewis, of Denison,
may be hoisted on to the Supreme Court
Bench any moment. As the figures of the
State election last April show that parties
are about equally divided in both these elec-
torates (each side secured three members),
and as the oldest party nearly always gains
an advantage from the personal vote which
a general Hare-Clark mix-up encourages,
Solomon sees the risk of by-elections, and is
side-stepping them. The chances appear to
be that both sides will come back practically
as before: 16 liberals and 14 Labor, and
even 15-all is predicted. What will happen
in this rotten state of affairs nobody can
pretend to prognosticate. An elective Min-
istry is the obvious solution; but, in the
absence of the referendum, and in the
presence of a Tory Upper House, which
could and would block every measure that
emanated from any Democratic member of
the elective Ministry, that way-out is not
immediately promising. If the elections re-
sult in a dead heat, as is possible, neither
side will provide a Speaker, and another dis-
solution will happen. And presumably the
result will be the same, or thereabouts, in-
definitely. Of course a few by-elections in
between times might help to settle the dis-
turbance ; but that road may lead to homi-
cide. For instance, if one of the Labor mem-
bers for Wilmot Division were to die or
resign to-day, the Liberal Government would
have 17 to Labor’s 13 in a House of 30, just
as soon as the by-election chose the dead
man’s successor; for there is a clear Lib.
majority in that electorate. On the other
hand, if one of the Lib. members for the
Darwin Division fell down a deep shaft to-
morrow, the resultant by-election would make
parties in the Assembly, 15 all. And if
then somebody suffocated another of the Lib.
members for Darwin with a yard or two of
his own speeches, the Lab. Party would be
sure of a majority, because by no possible
chance could a Lib. candidate win a by-
election in Darwin at present. The reverse
is the case in Wilmot. In Denison, on
present appearances, the death of one of the
Lib. trio would result in the loss of his seat
to his party for good; in Bass, ditto. In
the remaining electorate, Franklin, Labor
is in the same case as in Wilmot, and all the
Libs, have to do is to hire an assassin to get
away with the three Labor men, at intervals,
and the Lib. .Ministry may reign for ever —
or until parties are evened up again by the
sandbagging of a sufficient number of Libs.
rnV e ' ec t° ra tes where Labor predominates.
I here are great possibilities, especially from
a life-assurance point of view, about the
Hare-Clark voting system. Meantime,
while it is considering whom it should kill,
lasmania might do a great deal worse than
give its whole support to whatever party will
propose a way of ending for good the stupid
and dangerous impasse which has existed
tor years past in its politics—an impasse
which has again and again put the
► tate at the mercy of one man; and let
it be remembered that the one man may be,
in the future, a crank or a blackmailer. How
to end the trouble for good is quite a simple
proposition too. The referendum can be
handled with the greatest ease in the little
Mate, and it might well take the place of the
l pper House. Two local Houses in a speck


the size of Tasmania are a ridiculous excess.
The referendum —notoriously Conservative
in its operation—would supply all the re-
quisite brake. Add to the referendum (in-
cluding the initiative) an elective Ministry
as a means not only of securing the best
executive capacity all the time for the service
of the State, hut also of putting it out of
the power of the Camerons to command a
whole Ministry by playing off one party
against another, and Tasmania will for the
first time in its career make some real legis-
lative progress. Or. if it chooses, it can
make none at all. The matter will, at any
rate, he entirely in its own hands.
Some Further Aspects of a Vast
Question.
One writes on an unpleasant
topic, in a more or less friendly spirit, and
his remarks, being condensed, are to the
following effect: —
I read with interest “Plain English” (B. 5/12/’l2)
re the Queensland C. D. Act, and after consultation
with a well-known Collins-street doctor, make these
observations:—-
(1) On the authority of the Lancet (London)
C. D. Acts do not reduce disease.
(2) “Compulsory notification” is a very doubt-
ful and practically impossible proposal.
(3) As regards “pursuing the Magdalen calling
under the rose,” regulation does not prevent this.
(4) It has been found in America that “segre-
gated vice” areas tend to become criminal haunts.
(5) Education and free treatment of disease
without compulsion seem to be the most hopeful
means of minimising the trouble.
To which The Bulletin replies seriatim: —
(1) It is impossible for the Lancet or any other
paper or individual to prove definitely and
conclusively that C. D. Acts either do or do
not reduce disease. In the “Plain English”
referred to, this paper expressly remarked:
“No one claims nowadays that C. D. Acts repre-
sent the very latest and best steps that can be
taken in their line.” However, on all the available
evidence, they do good. The already-quoted report
of the Brisbane Council’s Chief Health Inspector
(viz., “As Chief Inspector of this city I cannot
make too definite a statement as to the evil effect of
the suspension of the C. D. Act.”) should go for
something. And there is other testimony available
• —tons of it. For example, H. C. French ( Syphilis
in the Army, 1907 ) says: “Venereal disease is ten
times more frequent among British troops than
among native troops.” In the native regiments the
officers administer a very effective species of C. D.
Act in the case of their men, just as the naval
authorities on the Australian station (and other
stations) do in the case of their subordinates. Since
a Gladstone Government repealed the C. D. Act in
India, the white troops have been, to a large ex-
tent, left to their own devices —and diseases. Again,
Havelock Ellis says ( Psychology of Sex, p. 328) :
“Outside of national armies it is found by admis-
sion to hospital and death rates that the Lnited
States stands far away at the head for frequency
of venereal disease, being followed by Great Britain,
then France and Austria, Russia and Germany.”
The obvious commentary on which is that while
in the United States, and in a slightly lesser degree
in Britain, there is complete freetrade in prostitu-
tion, in the European countries the evil is dealt
with, and in some cases ( e.g Germany) dealt with
very firmly indeed. .
(2) “Compulsory notification’ is neither a doubt-
ful” nor a “practically impossible proposal ’ though,
for many reasons, Collins-street and other meuieoes
and sheets of the Lancet stamp oppose anything ot
the sort. As a matter of fact, compulsory notification
is now recognised as the very first step in dealing
with contagious diseases, venereal and otherwise. In
Denmark, the world’s pioneer country in sanitary
matters, the treatment of venereal disease has been
free and compulsory , since 1906. This excellent law
applies to everyone, regardless of rank or wealth,
and the doctor who, in a spirit of mistaken kindness,
in any way shields or favors an infected patient, does
so at his own grave risk. To conservative-minded
physicians it may seem an outrage. But the system
has more than justified itself : so much so that, ac-
cording to Morrow (Social Diseases and Marriage),
educated people in the U.S. and Britain are already
calling loudly for the institution of a similar infamy
in their countries. , ,
(3) The Bulletin never for a moment contended
that regulation would prevent the “pursuit of the
Magdalen calling under the rose.” Such a probosi-
tion would be idiotic. Its actual words were: There
are at least three women who will pursue the Mag-
dalen calling under the rose, so to speak, for one
who is so hardened as to take to it beneath the dis-
approving and tireless eye of officialdom. It seems
such a natural and reasonable contention that this
paper doesn’t feel like laboring it further.
(4) It is true that in America, and elsewhere, seg-
regated vice areas tend to become criminal haunts.
But that onlv means that most criminals are poor,
and hence flock to the least desirable (or in other
words the cheapest) quarters of the town. \ice
areas, slum areas, smell areas, disease areas, crime
areas—they are all the same old area, broadly sneak-
ing. Talking of America in relation to C.D. legisla-
tion, it is a noteworthy fact that it was here that
Dr W E Harwood, of the Minnesota Iron Co.,
achieved, according to the Journal of the American
Medical Association (22/12/’O6), a triumph of
disease repression. By a rigid system of compulsory
notification and segregation he practically eliminate!
venereal troubles from his company s estate and
(5) Education is, of course, badly needed in all
these loathlv matters. The public acquires half its
physical troubles through ignorance. But the idea
of free treatment of disease, without compulsion, is
futile. It is notorious that patients are unwilling to
disclose the possession of what t}re Erench call
maladies hnntmises even to their own doctor. ov
much less likely are they to do it, as a mere matter
of patriotism, to a State employee! The fact that
patients will never, of their own free will. do a"y-
thing of the sort makes it essential, that the doctor
who treats them should do it on their behalf, lust as
he is already required to do in the case °f "'P '
theria, plague, etc. Elderly Collins-street doctors
—in fact, aged and Tory persons everywhere—are

This is the season to talk about the destruc-
tion ot the house-fly, mosquito and other
disease carriers Every year the public
; * e s m i lts . wr^ th with a large red spot on
its forehead where the anopheles stabbed it
under cover of darkness, and remarks, as it
removes a fly from the domestic butter, that
*t will be the death of these abominations
.vet. sometimes public bodies get the length
ot passing resolutions condemning the whole
race of flies, and placing it on record that
both politically and morally that race is
highly objectionable to the municipality or
the shire. Then the cooler weather comes
along, and the matter is hung up until the
next season of annoyance. When a regi-
ment moving to the attack of a position has
“ Per cent, of its men bowled over, it
comes on without taking any notice; when
10 per cent, fall it is shaken badlv, but still
keeps moving forward ; but when 30 per
cent, or more are hit, the whole attack col-
lapses, and everybody runs for his life. The
public keeps up its steady charge on the in-
sects that carry curse and bane, flicks them
with an infuriated duster, slashes at them
with a truculent towel, and never realises
that its ranks are being mown down bv the
small but deadly guns of the enemy. If 30
per cent, were seen to go down wounded,
there would be a worse panic than that
which overtook the Turks at Luleh Burgas.
But the public does not see, does not under-
stand. The guns of the insect army are so
well masked that it is hard to realise the
damage they really do. In plain fact, the
flies and fleas and mosquitoes are pretty
nearly as destructive as a moderately ener-
getic European invading army, and may at
any time, under favorable conditions for
their breeding, become as injurious as a
host of Asiatics. They interfere with our
sport and business, bowl over without re-
spect of persons our citizens, enter our
domestic circle and ravish and outrage in
the most abominable manner; and still we
are content to fight them with the towel and
feather-duster aforesaid. It is time mild
and spasmodic talking came to an end and
we declared war in earnest. The mosquito
can be dealt with by compelling his water-
bred children to drink kerosene; but the
common house-fly, which is the deadliest
enemy of all, does not even require that
much expenditure of coin and labor. To
utterly destroy the house-fly it is only neces-
sary to keep things clean., He is the pro-
duct of dirt. Kill the dirt and you kill the
fiv. When we say that the house-fly is one
of the worst enemies the public has to con-
tend with we mean, therefore, that the pub-
lic’s own dirt is getting it down and worry-
ing it. Hence, drastic as the course may
he, and great as is the interference with the
liberty of the subject which it may involve,
it is up to every local authority to insist on
cleanliness as a civic duty. Sydney and its
Gaud Mayor have been making a furious
fight against the simple and moderately pure
tram ticket; Melbourne has been struggling
fiercely aaainst the dust which her sportive
winds whirl in from the north; but the back-
yard, and the stable, and the place where
Mary threw the cabbage stalks are of far
more importance. It is there that the
house-fly raises his destroying armies and
equips them with the dirt of death, and it
is there and nowhere else we must fight the
Chat alia engagement which is the key to
the Sublime Porto of civic health.

A Chair of Jingo Futility.
The proposal to establish a chair of Imperial
History at the Sydney University is not the
kind of thing to be described as a landmark
in the progress of Australian education.
Rudyard Kipling in one of his blatant
Jingo moods once declared that the British
Empire was about the only thing worth
studying. No doubt the Hottentot and the
Apache had very much the same opinion
about their own tribal affairs, but the world
could hardly be expected to agree with them.
If ever there was an age when men wanted
their eyes open to that which was going on
around them, and their mental vision clear
about what the other fellow is doing, has
done in the past, and is capable of doing in
the future, it is the present one. The his-
tory of the British Empire is very largely
the story of muddling through. There has
been hardly a trace of design or indication
of national purpose in the whole business.
India was a great field of plunder; Canada
a chance possession taken from the French
with the idea rather of hurting France than
of doing anything either for the Canadian or
the Briton; Australia was a convenient
dumping ground for convicts which hap-
pened to attract a little settlement, and,
after turning out £750,000,000 worth of gold,
grew into a nation ; the United States, which
broke away from British rule, were in the
first place settled by refugees driven over-
seas by British oppression, except in the
case of Virginia, which was largely peopled
by the descendants of political prisoners sold
as slaves to the planters ; South Africa, after
being taken from the Dutch, was turned
down as useless, and at last taken over again
because it lay on the road to India, and
might be “wanted, on the voyage” ; the West
Indian and Central American possessions
were chiefly pirate haunts, used as stations
for receiving the plunder of the Spanish
main. In connection with none of these had
England any settled policy or national plan.
National plans it had, but they related to the
conquering of France, 4 securing of a para-
mount voice in the councils of the German
States, and other similar matters. Over all
these history wrote failure in large capitals.
What special advantage Australia can derive
from the study of a record of good luck beat-
ing an appalling lack of system it would be
hard to sav. It is, of course, absurd to. say
that Australia has no interest in the British
Empire, but it is enually absurd to suppose
that the study of what the daily papers de-
scribe as “Imperial science” has one-tenth the
value of the effort that might be devoted to
nractical work in other branches of human
knowledge. The future is with the nation
that grips reality by its foremost whisker,
and insists upon knowing most about those
things which matter most to its own people.
The A.W.U. Expands.
The Australian Workers’ Union, for long
the largest and most powerful industrial
body in the Commonwealth, has decided to
widen its scope and amalgamate into one
vast organisation all classes of country
workers.. Any person, male or female, en-
gaged at manual or mental labor is eligible
tor membership, and even the employer who
does not pay wages to more than two em-
ployees may come in. The A.W.U. is
already a tremendous force on the Labor
side in politics, and bids fair to be some-
thing more when it makes the influence of
its greater bulk felt. In the main that in-
fluence is likely to be well directed. There
is no crowd of men standing more whole-
heartedly for Australia and big national
ideas than the organisers and local reps,
who carry the weight of the union on
their shoulders. Politicians in the game
may win A.W.U. support and then play
their backers false, but their perfidy does
not pass without notice. Out of sight of
the place-hunting politicians who harangue
suburbanites from pub balconies there are
men keenly discussing by twos and threes
the political situation with an enthusiasm
and honest disinterestedness that are good
for Australia. The men who have put up
more than half the cost of establishing a
daily newspaper in Sydney—a newspaper
which thousands of them will never see —■
are the same who are forwarding motions
condemning the McGowen Ministry for its
lack of faith, and who would just as readily
turn down Fisher if once they were con-
vinced he wasn’t doing things in something
like an Australian spirit. The A.W.U. may
not be the highest and last thing in politics,
but if the rest of the voters of the Com-
monwealth were half as much in earnest,
things would get forward faster than they
do.

The Troubles of the Seafarer.
From a man who goes to and fro in ships:—
In days that have gone, the kicking against the
pricks came from the fo’c’sle and the stokehold. Now
they are coming from the bridge. The Man on Top
growls because the under-dog is biting and scratch-
ing. The stoker is the same the world over —he gets
on a wild jamboree in search of coolness and change
immediately his ship hitches up to the wharf. Who
can blame him? He seeks the solace of his kind, just
as does the skipper and the mates. Jack ashore
to-day is tamer than BlPme Bill the stoker, and
Jack is inclined to look down on Bill, forgetting
that the riotous things Bill is doing to-day are but
the actions of Jack of yesterday. Skippers of steamers
do not, however, begrudge Bill his time ashore; but
they do find his continued drunken bouts extremely
inconvenient, especially in these days when there are
stringent shipping laws and regulations. And it is
not merely a matter of the captain’s convenience;
for the great general public, when it goes down to
the sea in ships, places itself at the mercy of Bli'mf,
Bill. How dependable Bill is, the average captain
will incidentally tell as he utters a curse against the
booze that lays William out, and makes it necessary
for skippers to get off the bridge and go right down
to the beery bar and drag boozed Bill out at the
end of a policeman, and drop on him several buckets
of water for the good of the ship and the stokehold
and the public safety. Bill goes to the booze as
naturally as a duck to the wet. It is a habit, and
there is no greater habitual than Bill, now that
.Tack has reformed. The captain says he is looking
to the Government for relief. He declares (and he
deserves a lot of sympathy) that it is intolerable
that he should be fined for going out one or two
short of a crew which deserts him in favor of more
booze at the last minute. But he must have Bill,
and the way out of the trouble with Bill
is not by Act of Parliament. It is for the
great companies that are operating in these
waters to voluntarily combine to solve the
problem. There is more than the germ of an
idea contained in the scheme so successfully operating
in the circuit of the Harrtman group of railways
of the Southern Pacific (U.S.A.), with exactly the
same material as Bli’mii Bill. Clubs have been
established all along the line over there for navvy
and stoker —19 such clubs up to date —wherein the
men can do just as they please, so long as they keep
clean and sober. These clubs are not religious nor
charitable institutions. Nothing is free in them.
Though the railway company has a tidy sum invested
in them, it gets no interest on the investment. Yet
the venture “pays big,” and pays both company and
public. The railroad men, who spat in derision all
round these premises before they entered, now save
their money there instead of spending it at the pub.
There Bill can play billiards, and dine and dance
and sleep—and Bill has taken hold of its privileges
with both hands, and wipes his feet as naturally on
the mat as formerly he never wiped even the froth
off his beard.

The statement repeated ad nauseam that
the worker getting his present 10s. or 12s.
per day is no better off than he was when
he got 6s. or Bs. a day, by reason of the
increased cost of living, is knocked clean out
by a return prepared by Commonwealth
Statistician Knibbs. This gives particulars
as to the number of Australians who are
putting money in the Savings Banks and
the amounts they save, as compared with
previous terms. Cutting out shillings and
pence, these are the figures :
1903-’O5. 1905-’O9. 1907-’ll. 1911.
Depositors per 1000
of population .. 286 306 330 362
Average amount of
deposit .. .. £32 £33 £35 £37
Deposit per head
of population .. £9 £lO £ll £l3
Where there were 790 deposits in 1903, there
would, among the same number of people, be
1000 in 1911; and the depositors who owned
£865 in 1903 would own £lOOO now. The
workers spend more on amusements, pay
more for food and clothing, and hand the
landlord more for shelter, and are still able
to save more than ever. All this is chiefly due
to the provision of Wages Boards and arbi-
tration courts —and that, again, is chiefly
due to the arrival of the Labor leaven in
politics.
The flagship Drake left Sydney Harbor for
good last week, and the S. M. Herald tried
to be pathetic, maudlin and patriotically
Australian all in one breath about it. The
incident marks the point' at which the local
Tory is compelled, by sheer force of circum-
stances, to turn round within the compass
of his own waistcoat, and retract all that he
has been saying for several years with regard
to the possibility of the Commonwealth at-
tending to its own sea-defence. Only a few
months ago the proposed departure of the
British squadron from Sydney meant, in
Tory eyes, something like the withdrawal of
the Roman legions from Britain ; now it is
recognised, even by those most unwilling to
see, that the naval activities of Port Jack-
son are going to be far greater than ever in
the past. According to the Herald, the
departure of the Drake “makes call upon
every Australian to give new heed to the
problems of the defence of his country, and
more and more urgent attention upon the
Australian navy and its demand unon Aus-
tralian patriotism.” This is something like
progress. If things go on at the same speed,
we shall probably find before the year is out
the Tory press advocating straight railways
and military training for grown men, and
suggesting that the whole defence scheme
was the work of its own crowd in fierce
opposition to Labor’s supine dependence
upon Britain.
While the Federal Government, on one
hand, encourages the Australian manufac-
turer to walk the narrow track of honesty,
on the other it practically forces him to
tread the wide and easy way of deceit and
trickery. The boot trade offers an instance
of this. The Commerce Act sternly discour-
ages the loading of leather with glucose,
chloride of barium, and other weighting
material; but the foreign manufacturer is
mostly unhampered by Commerce Act re-
strictions, and may load his boots with sheet
lead if he can get them past the Australian
Customs. Of late, the harassed Australian
manufacturer has complained that he isn’t
getting a fair deal, so the gradual Customs
authorities have more carefully inspected
importations, and a consignment of chloride
of barium boots, adulterated with leather, is
just now stuck up at Adelaide awaiting the
Ministerial decision. If the men who built
the Tariff Act had done it as effectively as
they did the Commerce Act, there wouldn’t
be any quantity of imported chloride of
barium to worry over, and the man who
bought boots would be sure of getting honest
Australian leather ; but the importers’ agents
and the Freetrade Laborites in Parliament
did the work so sloppily that the consumer
is being rooked by the foreign manufacturer,
while the Australian manufacturer, in addi-
tion to paying higher wages for shorter
hours, must not adulterate like the foreigner.
No wonder the importer thrives.

The president of the Miners’ Association
at Broken Hill, supported bv the secretary,
has, on behalf of the so-called Freedom
League, “presented the boy Alfred Giles
with a gold medal in commemoration of his
disobedience of the Defence Act in not at-
tending drill.” This is the youngster who
went to gaol because his heroic father de-
clined to pay a fine. The Bulletin is not,
however, concerned with the heroic father
or the youngster; fdr the moment it would
merely like to know what the gentlemen
who identified themselves with the presen-
tation are doing inside the Labor party.
When men think so little of a Labor Gov-
ernment’s laws that they enter into a con-
spiracy to reward those who break those
laws, ordinary decency should tell them that
their place is outside the party. And if
they haven’t got the intelligence to see their
proper place, or the decency to take it if
they can see it, then the party should not
only show it to them, but put them in it —
unless, of course, it enjoys the process of
having its nose rubbed in the gutter. As
for the country, it is long-suffering in this
matter; but somebody will have to be shot
for treason some day.
This is the plainest way to put it. When
Chief Justice Stout fined the Mer-
chants’ Association of Maoriland, the Col-
onial Sugar Refining Co., Levin and Co.,
W. M. Bannatyne and Co., and Joseph
Nathan and Co. an aggregate of £5OOO for
breaches of the Commercial Trusts Act,
1910, he found the following facts proved:
(1) That the scales 2 and 3 (discount) were made
to prevent competition in the sale and disposal of
sugar.
(2) That they were made to enable a commercial
trust or association or group of buyers to get the
control of the distribution of sugar.
(3) That they were made so as to prevent Fair-
bairn, Wright and Company or other persons from
purchasing sugar and giving certain discounts to
purchasers from them.
(4) That the defendants were acting in consort or
conspiring together to get this control.
(5) That they were made so as to ensure a profit
that might otherwise not have gone to the members
of the Trust going to the members of the Trust.
Pending the appeal, that little lut will take
some chewing over.

“Benzine” goes for a picnic:—
I have been spending > charming holiday ’mid what
the Tourist advt. told me were tne vast unutterable
solitudes somewhere in N.S.W. There are lakes
among the solitudes—good, big lakes, which are
placidity personified until the wind gets up. I was
drinking in the solitude, and agreeing that it came
up to specification, when the silence became more
silent through the sudden stoppage of our swine of a
motor-launch. I kept on drinking in the splendid
scenery, when it began to dawn on me that the said
scenery was beastly remote. A brisk nor’-easter was
raising a nasty jobble, and we were drifting before
it towards the broadest expanse of fluid in the
whole lake-system. Our cargo (feminine mostly)
began to get uneasy, so I went for’ard to reconnoitre.
The skipper and his crew of one raw youth had
decided, by two votes to none, that something leaked.
By the appearance and smell of the vicinity, I
agreed with the majority. By three to none we
decided that it was benzine. They went on monkeying
with taps, cocks and valves until the skip, said:
“Give it her again, John/’ John wrestled with a
tin of oil and got about a gallon into the tank. The
skipper was fiddling with the starting process with
huge unsuccess till I pointed out that half the
taps hadn’t been turned off, and the benzine was
pouring out as fast as John poured it in. This was
fixed up, and John got to grips with another tin.
This time he got quite as much into the tank as on
to the floor. But still she wouldn’t gee. The skip,
looked round for inspiration, and couldn’t see even
a pelican. He scratched his pate and asked John
for a cigarette. John had the necessary. The
skipper, raising his heel, struck a match. As I
said, we were in the centre of profundity. Not a
sign of humanity on the horizon, nor the chance of
assistance. The lake was 12ft. deep, the nearest
shore four miles off. Not a life-buoy or anything
floatable on board except a picnic hamper. Our
flimsy cabin, full of women and children, simply
reeked with the fumes of the spilt spirit, and he
struck a match. I, who have known a launch to
catch fire from the alleged enclosed lamp, looked at
him spell bound. From the other end of the launch,
I watched him light up, pass the match over to John,
who, after using it, threw it away—into the middle of
the benzine, as like as not. For the next quarter of an
hour John, with his cigarette in his teeth, stuck his
face into the innards of the motor. I essayed to
express my feelings, but couldn’t make him hear, for
little Gladys was being told that she must wait 10
minutes before having her 11th banana. I found
myself weakly estimating the odds about that 11th
vegetable exploring Gladys. Nothing, however, hap-
pened, till John tripped over someth'ng, which set
the motor going. The skipper apologetically ex-
plained that, owing to the excessive consumption of
benzine, the voyage would have to be curtailed. I
enthusiasticallv proposed home at once, and backed
up by Gladys’s grandma (who providentially seemed
to have swallowed most of the fumes from the ben-
zine, and wasn’t feeling jovous). “home” was car-
ried. The vast, unutterable solitudes may have
their uses, but I’m plumping for the lee of Pinehgut
until the Law provides for the licensing of motor-
launches and those who drive them. At present the
Law doesn’t officially admit the existence of th?
skipper and Cigarette John.
The Torturer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Two men were flogged in Pentridge (Vic.) dur-
ing December. One Melbourne paper, commenting
on the barbarism, says: “Society must defend it-
self.”
I saw the sanded prison yard,
The sloped triangle by the wall,
The shaven warders, grim and hard,
The good blue Heaven over all;
And then they brought the man, and there
They strapped him for the torturer.
His face was deathly white, and stark
As some fierce Asiatic mask.
His back was white without a mark
When Mr. Hangman faced his task ;
Where fell the cat the weals ran down
Like ripples on a silken "own.
The flesh piled up in ridges, broke.
And blood flew from the swinging thong.
And now with every biting stroke
I knew for truth here was a wrong
Far greater than the culprit’s crime—
An offering to the beast of time !
I looked on him who whirled the cat.
Amazement filled me. He was stout,
A frock-coat wore, a Paris hat.
With pince-nez riding on his snout.
His hands were plump and white, for he
Was that fair thing, Society.

WHERE
EVERYBODY
GOES
The Maoriland Worker is the organ of the
noisy local Federation of Labor, though it
might from* its tone be the organ of Chaos, or
the Devil, or even the Peace Society. In a
column headed “Christmas Thoughts” it
“asks every man and woman in the Dominion
to refuse to uphold the present suicidal and
extravagant system of defence. To Hell,” it
cries, “with empire if it means the killing
of the man-soul and mother-love that have
raised man above the beasts !” To which it
may reasonably be replied that the Defence
system in Maoriland doesn’t exist for the
defence of empire, but to save from destruc-
tion in one small group of islands the white
man’s ideals, which include mother-love and
man-soul, and other things which the white
race regards as worth saving, and the black-
and-tan peoples mostly don’t. Considering
the altogether unnecessary violence of the
h ederation of Labor in all industrial matters
and their refusal of arbitration (their fav-
orite formula being ‘To Hell with all agree-
ments !”), it is a little difficult to understand
their attitude towards a citizen army. What
exactly would become of a nation which re-
fused to submit its quarrels to arbitration,
refused to be bound by a treaty, and also
refused to fight? Would the other nations
shut it up in a lunatic asylum, or what?
George T. Allen, the bachelor secretary
to the Commonwealth Treasury—the man
whose name is on all Australia’s bank-notes
nowadays—is a C.M.G. as well as an
I. The additional burden, it is hinted,
will prove too much, and the popular official
will hand in his official checks at an early
date. Under happier circumstances he would
not retire until 1916.
An echo of the Ballarat School of Mines
accident (B. 17/10/T2), when a student
named McKenzie had his left hand blown
off, and his right eye destroyed, through
ramming an old cannon to fire a salute.
McKenzie was in his fifth (final) year of the
course. He left the hospital in November
to sit for his exam. The results are out, and
McKenzie passed. That’s pluck, for the
final School of Mines exam, is a pretty stiff
one, and takes a lot of study.
Died on New Year’s Day, A. D. Nelson,
head of a well-known Sydney engineering
firm. In 1898 he scandalised the Freetrade
press by standing as a Protectionist for the
Flinders division and winning the seat. In
those days East Sydney, with G. H. Reid at
the head, was the centre of the Freetrade
kingdom, and the idea of a Protectionist
winning Flinders wasn’t dreamt of. Nelson
held the seat for nine years, retiring only
when his electorate was swamped by a redis-
tribution of seats.
The stitch that doesn’t save nine has been
in evidence in Adelaide. The Australasian
Implement Co. on North Terrace had fitted
its building with a beautiful, costly, auto-
matic fire-quencher. One recent midnight,
Fate (or the Devil) arranged a private re-
hearsal. The intelligent niachinery sounded
an alarm, rang up the fire brigade, and
meanwhile deluged the whole premises from
a 20,000-gallon tank. But there was no
sign of a fire. A six-inch pipe had somehow
burst, and the sudden pressure had loos-
ened all the wax caps of the sprinklers and
set the bag of mechanical tricks going.
The Blayney (N.S.W.) by-election, so far
as it has gone, proves nothing much except
the value of the referendum. Some voted
for Beeby because he had “chucked up his
job,” some because they were sick of the
two big parties; some voted for the Labor
man because he was against the freehold and
the big estates, and some voted for Withing-
ton because he doesn’t think the farm-hand
should have a Wages Board. And the second
ballot —in which Withington and Beeby will
alone be concerned —probably won’t be much
more satisfactory or decisive. This paper
has a lot of sympathy for Blayney; fits
choice lies between a man who has the
jumps concerning “Federal encroachments”
and another whose chief job would be to help
put the lamentable Wade and Wood into
office. A second or a third or a fourth ballot
is a mighty poor substitute for the referen-
dum.
Retired from N.S.W. Treasury, C. G. L.
Boyce, who has wrestled with red-tape for
38 years, the last decade as Comptroller of
Accounts (and don’t overlook the “mp” in
the middle). When Saunders was trans-
ferred from the Treasury to the Public Ser-
vice Board, he engineered the promotion of
J. W. Holliman, Secretary of the Board, to
the vacant Under-Secretaryship. This step
knocked old precedent clean out, and scan-
dalised Holliman’s seniors in the service,
especially Boyce. Boyce, who is fierce and
fiery, made so much row about it that he
was handed a pat of butter in the shape of
a change of title from accountant to comp-
troller of accounts (with the “mp” in the
middle). Ever since then the comptroller
has obviously believed himself miles above
the small under-secretary, who was merely
head of the clerical side, or something like
that. Just how his successor will fill his
independent shoes is exciting mild interest in
the service.

A flimsy thing is “The Parish Priest,”
produced on Saturday night at the Palace
(Sydney) for the first time in Australia, by
Alien Doone, the lightweight actor of senti-
mental Irish plays. This is all there is to
it: h our young people have been under the
spiritual care of his Rivirince since child-
hood. When the curtain rolls up on the
scene, they have reached that stage in sweet-
hearting when the engagement announce-
ment may be expected to explode with a
definiteness that cannot be ignored. As a
result of a lover’s tiff, however, one of the
girls steals the other girl’s boy, and Father
W halen puts in the rest of the evening
shooing the pusses back to their proper cor-
ners. Doone stated on Saturday night that
the piece had been read by a number of
Sydney clergymen (Roman Catholic and
Irotestant), leaders of the Hibernian Soci-
ety, and others, and they had advised him
to stage it. This paper heartily believes it.
It is exactly the kind of play Mrs. Ilemans
would have recommended for the young. To
make the thing “go,” individual character
acting has to be relied on to an unusual ex-
tent, and the Doone co. comes through with
honors fairly even.
Allen, himself, could
hardly have done
much better with the
shallow part of Father
Whalen; and Edna
Keeley, his leading
lady, as his gentle
ward, did about as
well as she usually
does. Specially pleas-
ing was the skill of
Ethel Bashford as
Agnes Cassidy, a
spiteful little cat with
the small portion of
good heart that usu-
ally goes with that
brand of feline. Tom
Buckley also deserves
a r e c o m mendation
for his Irish rouse-
about. Half a re-
commendation goes to
Frank Cullenane, who
was a truly typical,
gay Irish - American
until half-way through,
when his acting blew out suddenly on
being called upon to turn on grief and
indignation. In the scene where he whirled
on his brother like a righteous Cain to smite
an unrighteous Abel, he was only equalled
in feebleness by the maudlin singing of “An
Old-Fashioned Mother,” by Allen Doone.
The others in the cast did well enough.
* * * *
For a first night, “The Parish Priest”
had particularly bad luck. Its strongest
claim to the attention of an audience lies in
the second act, especially in the pathos of
its ending. On Saturday night one or two
apparently over-dined women in the stalls
set to guy the show with hysterical
laughter. To a considerable extent they
killed the act, and only by a cast-iron grip
on themselves did the players on the stage
keep from breaking down in their parts. At
the close of the scene, Doone appeared at
the footlights and metaphorically slapped
the ribald females, whereafter there was a
long and continued silence in their vicinity.
The time for dealing with the theatre-going
nuisance who finds a larrikin joy in annoy-
ing his or her neighbors has been ripe for a
considerable period, and The Bulletin
congratulates one manager on giving it the
choice of behaving itself or being ushered
into the stilly night.
** * *
“Florodora” continues to boom at Her
Majesty’s, Sydney; and The Bulletin
doesn’t expect to hold the inevitable autopsy
on this intensely vital old show for weeks
to come.

So charming does the Victorian maiden
look in her swaying crinoline in the first
act of “Milestones.” at Sydney Criterion,
that, were the business men in Paris who
decide these matters to decree the revival of
the weird thing to-morrow, Sydney women
would rush to get inside hoops. One of the
morals of this Darwinian sermon is that, no
matter how hideous the costume that
Fashion makes a pretty woman wear, she
will contrive to look pretty in it.

Those who like to take their drama with
& drop of religion in it are crowding to
“haust,” at Sydney Theatre Royal. Since
the number of these persons is as the sands
of the seashore or the rabbits of the interior,
business should be good at the Castlereagh-
street house till the cows return, or a formal
protest against the show arrives from Sheol.

The Tivoli will need to hit things up a
bit. _ Of its 12 turns, eight are revivals, and
a ninth, Florence Baines, isn’t unknown in
Sydney. Nevertheless, the casual visitor can
still get his money’s worth from the Arabs,
Minnie Kauffmann, Alexander Prince and
Bentley, and regard tIM rest of the pro-
gramme as a sort of bonus for cash.

Kinemacolor, at Spencer’s Lyceum, still
holds the eye of the Sydney picture world.
This week a further series of Durbar
films, including the State entry and the
elephants’ full-dress rehearsals, were un-
wound ; and if Chunder Loo and his un-
gainly beast were not rushed along at such
an unnatural, speed, this paper would regard
the whole thing as being on the border-line
of perfection. “The Red Barrier,” a love
yarn, with a Russian count —wicked, of
course—in it, was Spencer’s other mainstay.
The Crystal Palace fire, by this time ancient
history, hasn’t interrupted the picture de-
partment. This week the star was “When
Woman Loves,” a three-reel gypsy yarn in-
troducing a blend of love and hate, and
winding up a very long journey satisfac-
torily. “Williams’s Weekly,” which is in-
clined to specialise too much in tea-party
scenes, has extended its operations to Mel-
bourne and Adelaide, and collects some very
good snaps. The Crystal Palace Winter
Garden is laid up for repairs, but the rest
“THE MONK AND THE WOMAN,” AT

The National Amphitheatre is according
its proudest position on the bill, just now, to
John Fuller —a veteran tenor singer with a
pleasing voice and an easy method of pro-
duction. Pedrini and his baboon friend and
fellow-artist Toby are still there; also Jules
Garrison and his maids, La France and
others too numerous to mention. Resides,
most of them have been repeatedly men-
tioned before.
This paper doth with whispering humble-
ness confess that o’er the l>mit of engoldened
Truth it spoke in light disparagement of
wordy Shakspeare’s worth to Oscar Asche’s
show. To say that William Francis, the
Immortal Bard, is a negligible quantity in
the success of the “Antony and Cleopatra”
production at Melbourne Royal is to forget
those noble periods when pageantry of
language outrivals the gorgeousness of the
scene. Baconspeare has his triumphant
moments, especially in those touches of
nature which make all ages kin. Note, for
instance. Cleo’s cattish references to Tony’s
first wife. After taunting the man with
having been fond of the lady, she complains
of his lack of grief at her sudden decease.
Fulvia is a red rag to Cleopatra’s rage until
she passes out, whereupon the disreputable
monarchess graciously assents to her Tony’s
return to Rome on urgent business. She is
the Zaza of Old Nile, the paragon of all the
passions, the eternal feminine in femininity’s
uncontrolled state, most convincing when
she is most unreasonably jealous. Bacon-
speare presents a very definite Cleopatra in
the opening scenes, and from the mouth of
Enobarbus he pours an immortal descrip-
tion of how she came to invite her lusty
Antony to begin where Julius Caesar had
left off. The retrospect is enchanting.
Two or three cuts have been made in
Asche’s condensation of the profuse play
since the first staging, but the interpolated
silent spectacle of those drunken sleepers in
Cleo’s banqueting hall, the morning after her
final gaudy night, remains to point a Wow-
serian moral and adorn the author’s tale.
Everybody is limp and incapable save the
garlanded Queen, who sits bolt upright on
tier royal bench wondering what will hap-
pen next. It is a shocking tableau, followed
by an awful awakening, for when the doomed
Antony and his captains are roused to a
sense of the catastrophe in store for them,
they rush away to battle —heads splitting
and throats like limekilns —without being
invited to take a hair of the Egyptian dog
that bit them. Not even a cup of coffee or
a long sherbet! This is surely an oversight
on Oscar Asche’s part. He seems to have
forgotten that such experts in dissipation
as Antony and Cleo would never have al-
lowed a party of gaudy-nighters to go thirsty
away. At the sound of the first trumpet-
call, a procession of slaves should thread
their way among the drunks, star-scattered
on the floor, and give to each a glass of
foaming pick-me-up and a gilded straw.
Roars of shrill young merriment continue
to emphasise the fact that “Puss-in-Boots,”
at Her Majesty’s, is fairly strong in hap-
penings which please the children. The
modern juvenile gets a lot of discredit for
being a blas6 cynic whose warmest term of
admiration is “not too bad,” but a “Puss”
matinee audience laughs this libel to scorn.
The Dormitory Scene wherein Ivy Schilling
went to bed with her shoes on has been with-
drawn from the Williamsonian annual for
the present, and the rest of it might be im-
proved by being purged of one or two dull
ditties, and roused to more animation in its
movements.
** * *
At the King’s, there is steady support for
Jo Smith’s literary Australian melodrama,
which gives the Northern Territory a glow-
ing advt., whilst suggesting that the pearl
trade is somewhat demoralising. Beckett,
as the Port Essington purchaser of pearls,
and Harrison, as a plump Jap who dives
for them, are the only parties in the play
who tend towards villainy. Perhaps their
worst behavior is almost pardonable under
the circumstances. They merely try to keep
Cyril Mackay suspended harmlessly in a
basket over a river what time Beckett is
“pinching” his gold discovery on / Mount
Wommara. As a matter of fact, there’s not
enough of sin and wickedness or full-blooded
emotion in “The Girl of the Never Never.”
In his anxiety to avoid overdoing it, Jo
Smith has left the piece underdone. The
play tastes rather like a piece of veal with
the sage-and-onion stuffing omitted. As for
the neatly written comedy relief, it isn’t the
author’s fault that his boy and girl sweet-
heart characters are impersonated by Tom
Cannam and Miss Erris.

These are the last nights of The Damsel
Who Took the Wrong Footpath at Mel-
bourne Princess’s. On Saturday, “The Bad
Girl of the Family” reasserts herself, and
the famous bed-clothes will once more flap
in the breeze.. Queer as it is, the forthcom-
ing drama will be more welcome than the
present attraction, which, with all its fine
sentiment, stands in a class by itself. The
very prevalence of Bob Inman, A. 8., con-
stantly pursuing his tart with his hat in
one hand and a cased bird in the other, gives
the production an unusual appearance. But
the fact that Providence also takes a hand,
and frequently warns the girl with admoni-
tory play of thunder and lightning, makes
the show altogether unique. There never
was a play in which Heaven had such a
big, fat part; and, like all beginners, it over-
acts.
Although it is impossible to put a quite
new appearance on a familiar trick, or to
stage an illusion 'which doesn’t bring a simi-
lar miracle ,to mind, the wizardry of De
Biere is a potent attraction at Melbourne
Opera House. The little man with the for-
eign Yankee accent is an artist in all he
does. He acts well, patters neatlv, and
makes his trickiest feat —with his thumbs
tied go a long way in a cleverly-arranged
entertainment. Nella Webb sings one or
S <P T P-^ S a re preferable to the special-
ised ‘Kosciusko.” the Lancaster Opera Co.
still consists of seven people who commit
ancient Irish ditties in chorus, and Alberto
Marini is the same full-chested little Italian
a ? before. Just now he is warbling
Sally Horner” pleasantly enough, but not
nearly so effectively as the late Wallace
Hing, a West Indian, sang it once upon n
time.
Miss Robinson Crusoe is the latest arrival
at the Melbourne house that West built.

The young person incites a count and a
Yankee Croesus to pursue her with the best
0 f matrimonial intentions. The prize even-
tually falls to the Amurkan person, who,
after chasing her half over the map, has the
luck to rescue her from niggers who are
wavering between worshipping her as a
deity and serving her up for the chief’s
breakfast. All told, it is a good and adven-
turous story compounded of Defoe and D—
farce, and it excites the aggregate small boy
to a fearful rapture. Rather Ouidaesque is
“The Non-Commissioned Officer,” with its
beauteous young soldier and his ‘high aspira-
tions; white “An Episode of Waterloo” de-
picts an alleged incident of the famous scrap
with all the film-fakir’s disregard for mere
facts.
The most notable film at the P’ran Lyric
(Vic.) last week was “His Past,” which
rose up to hit the principal character with
harrowing details of misspent hours, just as
he was in pursuit of the banker’s daughter.
It was a most unkind resurrection, for it
spoilt his chances of becoming one of the
right-thinking Uppah Classes, and thereby
probably lost a vote to the great Liberal
party thereabouts. Sensational fiction was
best represented by “The Oringer,” and
people who want to see how a hero can die
with his face upturned to the morning star-
ought to gaze on this production. Another
feature of last week’s bill was “Death or
Glory,” picturing about equal quantities of
both; while “Love is Blind*” deserves all the
favorable comment that is left in this nibful
of ink.
The Dandies, at St. Kilda (Vic.), are
bearing up as well as possible under annoy-
ing weather conditions. Fred Monument
keeps his voice in its usual good order, and
has been warbling “Rose of My Heart,” a
song that tries to express heartbeats and
sighs in soulful music. Miss Tessa Byrne
has had “Dream of Home” in her melodious
grip, and, with Miss Dorothy Manning as
an accomplice, has given another outing 'to
“The Venetian Boat Song.” The soothing
baritone of Renn Millar has been noticeable
in “The Sea Dogs,” and Graham and Walton
have each in turn opened the door in his
face to let out some distinctly humorous
songs.

At Adelaide Royal, Roy Redgrave and a
strong Anderson co. are reviving old melo-
dramas which make some of to-day’s look
singularly thin. “The Span of Life” has
now made way for Boucicault’s “After
Dark.” The midnight express goes as well
as ever, and the music-hall scene gives a
chance to Morris and Shand and the St.
Leonards. With the Tivoli temporarily
closed, the King’s has a monopoly of variety
business, and manager Fuller puts up a
good programme—the Bow troop of acrobat
dancers. Merlyn the magician, and Albert
and Hillier. Also, the “Wanderers” give a
clever musical first part at this house, includ-
ing some “potted” plays, Pelissier fashion.
The Empire films a financial drama, “Light
After Darkness” ; and West’s house shows
Saharet in a rather lurid Parisian “Behind
the Mask,” and a quaint study of a real-life
monkey-hunt. Wondergraph, getting ready
for a new beauty show, advertises bravely !
“For lady bathers. No conditions whatever.
Competitors can wear any costume they
choose.”
“Benno”: Re the origin of slang. “Wording
’em” I believed to be a phrase peculiarly Austra-
lian, having met with it nowhere else. It is applied to
the “lad’s” playful habit of addressing quaint witti-
cisms to the “tom” or “tart” who happens to have
caught his fancy in the Sunday night jaunt along
Swanston-street. But there is nothing new under
the moon —-here is Cleopatra saying, “He words
me, girls.”
“Private Boxer”: The girls of the old brigade,
who were theatrical “Pets of the Public” in these
parts 25 years ago, make an interesting list. “Pris-
cilla Prink” (B. 2/l/’l3) wonders where they all
are now. Not easy to say. Some are dead, and
some are grandmothers. The grown-up daughters of
one or two of them are making their mark, notably
Kate Bishop’s Sydney-born chick, Marie Lohr. A.
daughter of Agnes Thomas is, curiously enough,
playing in Sydney at the nresent time —Eily Malyon,
who is Rose Sibiey in “Milestones.”
“J.F.11.” (from London) : After a week of negoti-
ations, interviews and private performances with
the Lord Chamberlain and his advisers as the only
audience, the official ban upon “A Venetian Night”
was removed, and the public allowed to see a
severely expurgated version of the originally odorifer-
ous spectacle at London Palace. The result of the
rigid blue-nencilling is to make the thing an inco-
herent medley. It is a sort of a dream affair, in
which a new-made Venetian bride is supposed to be
visited in her bedroom by her former lovers.
Scenery and music are good ; the rest of it is silly
and unpleasant. Meantime, the crusade against the
epidemic of “disrobing scenes” and “bedroom
dramas” grows steadily and strongly.
The London Opera House, the ill-starred venture of
the N’ York Jew, Oscar Ilammerstein, has at last
found a syndicate to give it another chance. At the
head of the adventurers is Ferrand Akoun, of Luna
Park, Paris, who intends running it as a two-shows-
a-night house at prices ranging from sixpence to five
shillings. He went over to London to attend a
funeral, saw the Opera House, mistook it for a hospi-
tal or gaol or something similar, was corrected,
investigated the inside, and took a lease of it —all
within 24 hours. The syndicate is going to provide an
up-to-date nursery on the premises, where baby will be
looked after while mum is enjoying the perform-
ance.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
AT MELBOURNE ROYAL.
Enter Oscar as Antony.

“Ami”: The Greig-Holloway wedding interested
me, Beatrice being the party in my eye. One or
two of us can remember papa Deorwvn, who used
to go about with the copy-book under his arm,
replete with press notices of Alice and Constance.
Conny married Dick Stewart, Nell’s brother. Alice
first came forward as a little dancer, to the tune
of “Blue Danube,” in the Royal Panto of 1873.
She married Charles Holloway; hence Beatrice.
Essie Jenyns is a cousin. She came from the Bill
Holloway side. Beatrice is the absolute perfection
of that ingenue so welcome to Parisian theatre-
goers, but not so worshipped on the English
boards. No art could counterfeit the natural tears
in her voice. I’m sure as a child she could wheedle
mother out of sponge-cake' whenever she liked.
And I liked her Jo better than Jennie Lee’s, for
Jane had become rather hard.
Lewis Henderson, whose silk hat, frock-coat and
spotless spats are the despair of the rest of the
musical profession, is now in charge of the J. C.
Williamson Royal Comic Opera orchestra, vice An-
drew McCunn, who has gone south to the “Puss-in-
Boots” panto. “Florodora” is therefore now chort-
ling under the baton of the President of the Pro-
fessional Musicians.
Nellie Mortyne, one of the most forcible and ver-
satile of Australian actresses, is to have a farewell
benefit night at Melbourne Bijou on the 21st inst.
The present generation of theatre-goers knows Miss
Mortyne by her clever comedy character acting,
wrru r Clarke-Meynell management, notably in
'u le ll yP ocr * tos >” an d as the convincing landlady
who got converted from her hash-house errors by
the new lodger in “The Passing of the Third Floor
Back.” A somewhat older generation remembers her
as Poppea in the first Australian production of
‘Sign of the Cross.” And a still older crowd lost
their hearts to her in the davs of her youth, ere she
had made good as an Australian mummer in Britain,
America and Africa. Though her stage •experiences
began 35 years ago in this country, she has never
yet received a complimentary benefit, and her forth-
coming “night” at the Bijou will be a well-
deserved send-off. Miss Mortyne leaves for America
in February, nor is she likely to return to the land
of her birth.
“Front Stalls” : S. M. Herald did Allen Doone in-
justice when it charged him with a touch of “nerves
brought with him from America,” because he pro-
tested against disorder from a party in the audience
during the second act. of “The Parish Priest” on
the opening (Saturday) night. “As far as the mass
of the audience was concerned,” said the Herald,
“the cause of the trouble never reached their ears.”
Don’t know whether the Herald man asked “the
mass of the audience,” but I know he didn’t ask me
or the people in the vicinity of the exhibition of
vulgarity. If he had, he would have heard language
considerably in advance of that used by Doone) Two
people (one a lady) left their seats to go and com-
plain about the nuisance—an unusual thing—and
the remarks of other exasperated stallholders
were painful and frequent. The thing that, aston-
ished me was that Doone did not stop the aot mid-
way in order to protest, instead of waiting till the
curtain fell. That he did not was a lasting tribute
to the fact that his nerves were under commendable
control.
“0.K.”: Oscar Asche’s beautiful setting of
‘Antony and Cleopatra” is only the third edition
of Shak.’s longest-winded drama I have seen in 40
years of systematic play going. The first of those
editions was so faked that the Bardolaters of the
period denounced it as sacrilege. Andrew Halliday,
who had dramatised Scott’s novels for Chatterton,
of Drury Lane, was commissioned to do as he liked
with Antony, and he did it. Previous productions
of Shakspearian plays had been more “legitimate”
than spectacular, but this was designed as a new
departure in classic melodrama. I remember that
the scenery left a vast amount of stage room avail-
able for the hordes of Drury Lane supers, and the
broad, expansive acting of the principals. James
Anderson, the hero of many ancient Australian-stage
reminiscences, was the Antony, and Miss Wallis (the
Mrs. Lancaster-Wallis of after years) cut a pretty
figure as the veteran enchantress. Anderson had
been excavated from the cavern of tradition for
special engagement. He was a burly, battered barn-
stormer in a preposterous wig. Short, black sausage
ringlets hung stiffly on either side of his red face,
and the lines rolled from his lips in thunderous
solemnity. He made the shortest syllables go a
darned long way. His scowling repetitions of the
announcement, “Ful-l-l-vi-a is de-a-add!” have
lingered in my memory for twoscore years, and his
fat, upstanding curls have haunted me in many a
crayfish dream. James Anderson was the worst of
the fine old tragedians I ever saw. Jack Ryder, an
excellent elocutionist of the stiff and formal type,
was the Enobarbus of that Drury Lane spectacle.
He spouted from the centre of the stage his descrip-
tion of Cleopatra in her barge, like one expectant
of a round of applause for his trouble. And Gus
Glover, in wrinkled, jet-black tights, was the slave
who brought Cleopatra the news that Antony had
married again. The rest of the cast I disremember.
Nearly 20 years later, in 1889, Geo. C. Miln staged
“Antony and Cleopatra” at Melb. Opera House, and
went finally bung over the costly failure. Though
there was brightness and intelligence in Miln’s pro-
duction, the nasal Yankee accents and general
amateurishness of Louise Jordan as Cleopatra gave
the show no chance to pay exes. To compensate for
the weakness of the Egyptian Queen, her faithful
Tony from America (Miln) introduced a couple of
athletic sporting turns into the gaudv ni'dit seen* 1
in Act 4. “Professor” Benjamin gave a display of
spangled club-swinging, and “Professor” Miller,
with his hands chained together, was introduced as
a convict slave doomed to wrestle with any cham-
pion whom Antony might select. Miller had no
lines to speak, but he was required to snort and pose
considerably, what time Antony ordered him to be
unfettered for a “go” with “Professor” Donald
Dinnie. The braw. bold Donald looked more Scawtch
than usual in the thin disguise of an ancient Egyptian ;
nevertheless, the pair of popular identities were a
great success with the gallery. Thev persoired
freely, to the accompaniment of friendlv exhorta-
tions —-“Go it, Miller,” “Noo you’ve gawt him,
Donald,” and so forth. But neither the wrastlers
nor the club swinger could have lived in the atmo-
sphere of the Gaudv Night which is a memorable
event of Oscar Asche’s great entertainment.
“One Who Pays”: “Puss in Boots” is Hickory
Wood. As with Behemoth, on earth there is not his
like—l hope. But I’m sorry the actors won’t speak
his poetry, or whatever it is. In Venice. I see
that Arlechino, Trufaldin, Tartaglia, and the rest,
just get a skeleton and make up the cackle, and if
the “Puss in Boots” book is the best that is avail-
able, I think the same plan should be adonted here.
The Dame is too good for her job ; while Powell, as
a so-called King, has the worst leading character I
ever saw in a pantomime. What to do with it I
don’t know. Evidently Powell doesn’t, either.
“Gee”: Has' anyone noticed the miraculous way in
which money comes to light in Stageland ? It is
nothing for an ordinary-looking mortal to pull out
a thousand in notes. “Ah, Jack,” says a lovely she,
“ray father’s home, the home of my ancestors, to be
sold all because we cannot raise a paltry £30,000
before the morning!” “Thirty thousand!” says Jack,
the virtuous. “Here, take this!” And diving into
his trousers pocket he yanks out a wad of bank notes
and hands them to her as if they were nothing more
than a tram ticket. Up to date I have seen
£3,000,000 produced from trousers pockets. Thirty
thousand takes about half a minute to raise,
100,000 about one minute, and as for 100 quid—
why, the actor people simply can’t prevent little
things like that falling from them. Yet I have
known one of these fortunate arid generous folk dredg-
ing fiercely in his trousers for a morning bob, and,
alas! dredging in vain.
“Mr. Ocky”: The practice of giving benefits to
stage favorites in Australia seems to be dying out.
During one year in the early ’9o’s there were some-
thing like 40 big and many small ones. G. W.
Anson, of the Brough-Boucicault co., was publicly
presented with a cheque for £250 (the proceeds of
his benefit) and an address. Billy Elton was another
who got the takings of a special show. In the for-
midable list there were also benefits to Alfred Dam-
pier, who had been giving melodrama at the Mel-
bourne Alexandra; to Mrs. Brough, G. S. Tither-
adge and Frank Cates, who had produced Pinero’s
“The Times,” reckoned to be the greatest effort of
the year; J. F. Sheridan, Charles Ryley (of the
Royal Comics, which scored principally with “La
Cigale”), E. J. Lonnen, Mrs. Cuttica (Italian opera-
tic singer), Maffezzoli (the orchestra man), 11. R.
Jewett, Teddy Rovce, Walter Bentley, Jennie Lee,
Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis, Messrs. Brough and Boucicault,
Harry Rickards and others.
When a play fails there are various ways of
notifying the fact. Miss Ethel Warwick, who was
lately running a season at the London Queen’s,
believes in blurting out the honest, unpleasant
truth. This is her latest proclamation: “Owing to
the unanimous condemnation of ‘Svlvia Green’ by
the press, Miss Warwick has decided to withdraw
the play after Wednesday’s performance.” Still, it
may be brutally rough on the author, whose work
may not have got justice from the company.
Macready, admittedly the greatest English actor of
the middle of the 19th century, was also the most
vile-tempered of that or any other time. His diaries
and journals have only now been published in full,
because had it been done earlier there would have
been a crop of actions, so outrageous were his re-
marks about his contemporaries. He disliked every-
body with whom he came into contact —with the soli-
tary exception of Charles Dickens. One of the few
people he ever thanked was Charles Gavan Duffy. A
wild, wayward son drifted out to Australia and was
befriended in Melbourne by Duffy, and Macready sent
a grateful letter. The diaries, a couple of bulky
volumes, are full of uncomplimentary references to his
own profession. He calls acting the “refuse of
trades.” Actors are idle vagabonds recruited from
the “lowest stages of society.” He had an almost
equal contempt for critics: “I wish I were anything
rather than an actor—except a critic. Let me be
happy rather than vile.” His frightful temper and
heated wrangles with the American actor Forrest led
to, protracted rioting in N’York. Sailing awav from
N’York, he bestowed a parting benediction by calling
America a “nation of blackguards.” He had a ter-
rific fight one night behind the scenes at Drury
Lane with his own manager, Alfred Brown, to whom
he gave a tremendous thrashing. For thgt he was
fined £3OO, plus the summary termination of his
engagement. He was intended for the Bar, but was
suddenly summoned from his studies to come to the
rescue of his pa, who had gone bung. .The young
fellow made such a hit as Romeo that he packed
the theatre nightly and put the old man on his
financial legs again. He was thus launched on a
theatrical career, but was always cursing the fate
that made him an actor instead of a barrister.
“Monkbarns”: “Grandpa” (B. 26/12/’l2) did not
see Brooke at Castlemaine in ’54. In the early part
of that year Brooke was in America ; he had a brief
lease of Niblo’s Theatre, N’York. Thence he re-
turned to England, and was engaged by Coppin for
Australia, where he made his first appearance (at
the Queen’s) in February. ’55.
“Bookware”: After reading “Antony and Cleo-
patra,” Dryden’s “All for Love,” on the same theme,
is well worth taking up. It is the best of his many
plays, and not such a drop from the mighty master
as one would expect. Dryden is the only dramatist
who has challenged Shakspeare and lived. His
weighty, massive English is a healthy study in a day
when we are too apt to be epigrammatic and whip-
cordy. I find quite a new world in a few of his
plays, also in the “Annus Mirabilis,” “Hind and
Panther,” “Alexander’s Feast” and “iEneid.” Such
a swing! Still, the Glorious John is onlv a moon
to the sun of the divine William.
“0. Ockney”: “Instinct” (B. 26/12/’l2), which
filled the bill vacated by the unacceptable three-star
combination at the Duke of York’s, London, is an
adaptation of a French piece by Henry Kistemaec-
kers. The gentleman of the unspeakable name was
also responsible for “The Turning Point” (“La Flam-
bge”), the current attraction at the St. James’s. I
doubt if Kistetcetera had ever appeared on a London
play-bill before that (I think I should have remem-
bered his name had I seen it), and now he provides
the show at two of the best houses. “The Turning
Point,’ by the way, has been bought for Australia
by Harry Plimmer, who will stage it early in the
year. If he could re-introduce Ethel Irving to us
in the part she is scoring in in London, what a
scoop!
“0.K.”: Archbishop Kelly has played into the
paws of the Yellow Pup by issuing an official denun-
ciation of “The Monk and the Woman,” the reigning
bellowdrama at Sydney Adelphi. Nothing is more
pleasing to Orangeism than an endeavor bv R.C.
Church authority to suppress any book, picture or
drama which is taken to reflect on its holiness. As
for the Archbish.’s fervent hope that “no Catholic
worthy of the name would countenance, even in-
directly, such depravity at such a season,” it goes
without saying that no Catholic who claims Joseph-
lan chastity for all the monks that ever were, is
likely to patronise a bellowdrama with the suggestive
title. So the too-unsophisticated prelate’s “bull”
turns itself into a boomerang, which doesn’t hurt
the party it is thrown at, but comes back wallop
into the camp it was thrown from.
“Spasmode”: Schneider, rather less than half a
century ago, got only £5 a week at the Palais
Royal, and was astounded by an offer of £2O a week
from Offenbach. Menier, also the rage of Paris, got
only £6 a week. The peerless Lemaitre never had
more than £8 a night. Yet Coquelin, not to be
mentioned with such a genius, got £240 a night as
Cyrano. Bernhardt got £2OO a night in “L’Aiglon.”
Patti was the first to get the gigantic screws. She
had £4O a minute at the Eden concerts, Paris
M. Faure had £BO a night; Mdlle. Nilsson, £4O.
Caruso beats everything. He gets, so it is alleged,
£40,000 for singing 80 times in the year. The
phonograph people give him £BO a record. Mil-
lionaire Smith, of New York, once gave him £6OO
to sing two songs. Caruso was witnessing an opera
at the Metrop., didn’t want to go, and had to be
dragged awav bv this stupendous amount. Smith
had boasted to the grand people at his soirOe: “I
will go and fetch Caruso.” So he had to bid up.
The much-talked-of Paris Ooera House averages only
£650 a night, and can hardly pay even one tip-topper.
The N.Y. Manhattan, or the Metrop., easily takes
from £2OOO to £2400. Such figures explain how
Bernhardt can command from America £2OO a
night, absolutely clear.
Genius runs in all shapes. “Buffalo” Vernon, of
the newest Wild West show, undertakes to throw a
bull by biting it on the lip. Somebody, commenting
on the greatness of this feat, asked the ornate pro-
fessor how he had learned to do it. Vernon modestly
described his ability to down a bull by lip-biting
as “a gift—somethin’ that comes kind o’ nacheral
to a man, like paintin’ or pooetry.”
From London: John Galsworthy’s new play, “The
Eldest Son,” just produced at London Kingsway
Theatre, is a powerful analysis and exposure of
English caste, _ cant, humbug and hypocrisy. Sir
William Cheshire, the eminently respectable and
God-fearing baronet, discovers that the under-keeper
of his estate has cot a girl into trouble. He vir-
tuously insists that the man must marry the girl
forthwith, or leave his service without a character.
Soon afterwards Sir William makes a fresh dis-
covery of the like character, but this time it is his
own eldest son and heir and a pretty housemaid who
are the culprits. The eldest son wants to marry
the girl he has seduced, but the furious father will
not listen to such a suggestion. “Interests of
morality be damned!” he excitedly exclaims. “It
would mean ruin and disgrace to our family ! How
can the Cheshires ever look the county in the face
if the eldest son marries his mother’s maid?” The
situation is fully discussed by the ladies of the
Cheshire family, and the nicest daughter sums it
up with the cynical observation that, “after all,
what’s coming won’t affect the girl as if she had
been a lady.”
“Haresfoot”: Jo Smith’s play, “The Girl of the
Never Never,” really is a play, not a cobbling of
sensations. The germ must have been found in Bed-
ford’s “White Australia,” which I saw with peculiar
gratification, though recognising that it was not a
play. Bear in mind his scene of the destruction of
the Jan fleet, in Port Jackson, by aeroplane bombs —
prophetic! Jo Smith’s best play," potentially, is “The
Miner’s Trust.” Really a grand idea. A dying man
instructs his chum, much like him in looks, to per-
sonate him and marry his sweetheart. This Tich-
borne supplies Castro with all the materials to prove
his case—and that’s the difference between fact and
fiction.
Millie Dagmar, the widow of Tom Fitzgerald, is
touring foreign parts these times with 10 educated
dogs and a performing pony. When last heard of
the plucky little woman was doing the star turn
in a variety show at the Johannesburg Orpheum,
and looming large in newspaper interviews.
The “cutting” of the unwieldy Melbourne panto.,
to bring it within reasonable time-limits, seems to
have left one or two members of the original cast
without a line to utter. Others are almost speech-
less with disgust and indignation.

All the traps about a theatre are not cut bv the

HE : “Little Jones reckons he has the best head
for figures on the beach—guarantees to pick
out the best ten in as many minutes.”
Lovely woman’s habit of recklessly reach-
ing after something she wants regardless of
consequences lately got one of her into
trouble at Geelong. She was deputy assist-
ant secretary to a drapery emporium, and
was filling in the remains of the lunch hour
by reading a novelette while perched on a
window-sill on the second storey. She had
got to the thrilling chapter where the dis-
guised duke offers his hand and his mort-
gages to the soap-boiler’s daughter, when
the book slipped from her hand on to the
verandah beneath. Without giving herself
time to break the thread of the narrative, so
to speak, she stepped outside to reach the
book; but that piece of verandah roof hap-
pened to be of glass, and the step to the
footpath was 14ft. long. She is now re-
covering in hospital, where her chief grief
is that in the excitement some literary cor-
morant annexed the novelette, and she
doesn’t know whether his Grace married
the soapy damsel or returned to his early
but impecunious love, the Lady Ermyntrude.
The Mawson expedition is to be picked up
by the Aurora, which left Hobart with that
object on Boxing Day. Apart from scienti-
fic observations, the keenest interest is dis-
played in the question whether Mawson has
discovered the Antarctic flea and the animal
which has become known as the “right”
whale. The apocryphal yarn of the £2OOO
which nature student Rothschild is said to
be dying to give for an Antarctic flea has
been resurrected; but there will be a very
disappointed scientist if the beast is cap-
tured and the money is claimed. The “right”
whale is a much more solid proposition.
It is the biggest extant animal known, and
can carry in its jaws as much as £6OO worth
of whalebone. The idea is to start a new
industry in Australia if it can be shown
that the heads can be brought here at a
profit. On the Aurora is a whale gun which
fires a harpoon with an explosive bomb
attached, and it is intended to do some fish-
ing with this ironmongery. Captain .Tim
Davis, who is to boss the harpooning, killed
his first whale off Tasmania when he was
16, and he holds a record of 10 whales for
11 throws with the harpoon.
The N. S. Wales Justice Department has
been worried in a small way lately by two
or three people who profess to have evidence
that there was a gross miscarriage of justice
in the case of young Moir, who was found
guilty a few months ago of the murder of
Trevascus. The only fact of any conse-
quence is that a simple-minded man, who
had told some newsboys that he was the mur-
derer, was found drowned near Manly. He
probably did suffer from the hallucination
that he was the murderer, and that probably
was why he drowned himself. But a real
murderer doesn’t usually go about confiding
his crimes to newsboys; and, anyway, Moir
made statements which left no doubt as to
the real criminal —if a man of his defective
intellect can be called a criminal. The de-
fence knew all about the young man who
was drowned, and clutched for a while at
that straw; but it was soon seen to be only
a straw, and was promptly abandoned.
Indeed, in view of Moir’s own statements, it
would have been a wicked thing to have at-
tempted to fasten the crime on to any other
person. A thing like that was done once
in N. S. Wales history, and just about the
most eloquent lawyer in the State is still
off the r6ll of solicitors in consequence.
“Ruru”: The statement recently made
that 50 per cent, of those who come into con-
tact with tuberculosis patients are more or
less suffering from the disease, must make
bad reading for some hospital nurses. Pro-
bationers in Maoriland hospitals, while
undergoing their training, are in some dis-
tricts called upon to put in a portion of their
time in attending to
consumptive patients
under conditions which
are, to say the least
of them, risky. I have
known girls on night
duty to attend to
pati e n ts scattered
over an area of an
acre or so, in tents
and shelters. This
sort of thing is all
right in good weather,
but in the dead of
winter, with rain
dripping from the
trees and the ground
sloppy underfoot, it is
bad business. The
young nurse does her
best, contracts a cold,
takes her dying
charges in her arms
to soothe their dis-
tress and —requires
the luck of a whole
legion of devils if she doesn’t develop the
disease. Incidentally, the girl is paid a
shilling a day.
There is a fine opening for the bright
young man who can develop the perfect in-
ternal combustion engine. They want it in
the British navy badly, and are working
night and day to discover it. The British
Empire has a bigger share in the oil deposits
of the world than any of its potential
enemies; and as ships driven by oil engines
would have a wider range than those driven
by coal-fed engines, naturally the oil engine
is in demajjd. Further, the perfect oil-
driven ship will be innocent of smoke, and
in the grey light of dawn and dusk it should
be able to steal upon its smoke-belching rival
and deal out heavy damage before the’ other
fellow realised an attack had begun. Thanks
to Percy Scott’s new fire-controller, some-
thing like 70 p.c. of the shots fired from
British warships will be effective. Take this
and place it in conjunction with the oil-
driven ship without spars and funnels and
smoke to betray it, and add the fact that the
newly-invented Australian explosive is noise-
less, smokeless and flashless, and consider
how a fleet of oil-driven ships, certain of
landing 70 p.c. effective shots, giving neither
flash nor smoke to betray its whereabouts,
could have a surprised rival fleet half de-
stroyed before a shot was fired in return.
The cause of Woman Suffrage in Britain
continues to suffer sorely from the violent
stupidity of its shrillest mouthpieces. A
spinster by the name of Gawthorpe—“iffttle
Mary” Gawthorpe—called upon her sex to
compel its political emancipation by abstain-
ing from food in their own homes from mid-
night on December 25. The artless idea of
this “militant suffragist” was that women
in general, being full stoked with old Eng-
lish fare on the night of the 25th, would be
able to exist without further meals for at
least a week, during which time she sup-
posed their refusal to eat would scare their
male relatives into demanding an immediate
passing of a Women’s Suffrage Bill by the
prorogued Parliament. Now, if she had sug-
gested a grand universal Christmas Dinner
strike by all the weary women-cooks in the
kingdom—a general refusal by the voteless
sex to do the greasy work incidental to
merry-making—the chances are that the
idea would have appealed to millions of

thoughtful beef banters, turkey trotters and
pudding makers, and the force of the suffra-
gette cause would have been felt in the
great stummick of the middle classes. Any
Government responsible for the suppression
of England’s traditional Christmas gorge
would have to remove the cause of discon-
tent or go out of office on its ear. The
suffragettes thus have it- in their power to
carry the war into every home and conquer
Toryism all along the line by merely raising
a banner with the popular device: “No Vote,
No Christmas Dinner.”
The withdrawal of the counter-lunches
from the Sydney hotels did not last long.
From the time it was first proposed, a few
months ago, there was lack of unanimity in
the camp, and despite pressure by the
Licensed Victuallers’ Ass. and a vigilance
committee’s efforts, a number of rebels con-
tinued to pass the sausage and cheese with
the noon-day beer. Meanwhile, enormous
business was lost by strong supporters of
the no-tucker scheme, particularly in some
of the big, popular city houses. So, with a
chastened spirit, General Bung recently gave
in and opened the larder, caring nothing for
his previously expressed anxiety that his
customers would be violently assailed by
the germs from food-pawing casuals, but
content to regain his trade. If Gen-
eral Bung liked, he could entirely soothe
his anxiety about the germs; but his con-
firmed filthy habits in regard to the
washing of _ drinking glasses seem to
show that he is not so very anxious on that
score. Probably about tuppence would
cover the laceration of his feelings.

Arrangements have been made with the
cable companies by which, if your maiden
aunt dies at the week-end, you can wire to
England about it at reduced rates. If she
dies on Monday or Tuesday it will cost you
a lot more. Maiden aunts are requested, in
the interests of economy, to accommodate
their taking-off to the new conditions.
The impending changes in the administra-
tion of Svdney University are likely to re-
sult in the election of the rector of St. John’s
College or of Archbishop Kelly to the Senate.
Since 1577 no ICC. prelate has sat in the
Senate. Before that time Archbishop Bold-
ing had been a member. Archbishop Vaughan
was nominated for a vacancy, and on the
understanding that he would not be opposed
he consented. Chief Justice Martin, Pro-
fessor Badham and others supported the
Archbishop. But they counted without Win-
deyer. the late Justice, who liked to spoil
cu’t-and-dried arrangements. Windeyer nomi-
nated VVigram Allen, and a look around
showed that the contest would be sharp and
bitter. The Archbishop consequently retired,
and for 35 years no R.C. prelate has held a
seat. # *
From a political Australian who has been
doing some organising on the other side: —
A section of Lon-
doners regard the
Greater Britains i n
general and Australia
in particular with dis-
like, not to say bitter
hatred. They seem to
resent being told of
the excellence of our
climate, the absence of
squalid poverty, a n d,
above all, the fiscal
system that has tended
to improve the Com-
monwealth’s industrial
conditions. At a North
London by - election,
when a speaker ven-
tured to incidentally
recommend Australian
meat, he was howled
down by a pallid mob
which consumed the
Argentina product
without generally
knowing it. The howl-
ing was all the more
undeserved because, as
a matter of sober fact,
the poor Cockney fares
badly at the hands of
the South American
beef exporter. Before
the “prime joints” and
fillet steaks reach him,
they have, in many
cases, been through the
extractor which is Ar-
geutinese for the bov-
ril - making process.
The bloodless beef is
chean as London prices
go : but as food for the
million it is about
equally nasty and un-
nutritious. One might
almost as well chew
leather.
“Y.Z.’s” mutter
of disappointment:
I have just been
looking at the students’
display for 1912 a t
Melbourne Nat ional
Gallery, and wonder if
there is another insti-
tution in all Australia
that produces so miser-
able an effect from so
great a cause. Here is
one of the best-equipped art schools in the world,
with an expensive expert at the head and front,
and one year’s product, so far as painting is
concerned, is a little bunch of pictures of still
life that, with the exception of a feeble spurt here
and there, do not rise above the level of the work
of a “decorator” of pub signs and grocery advts.
The paint is stale, the results fiat and unprofitable,
and not one gleam of originality or personality re-
lieves the awful oleographic gloom.

LOVE AWHEEL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I wooed her first in ’Ninety-Five
When everybody was awheel,
And each smooth highway was alive
With twinkling things of air and steel;
For twenty pounds or so we went
Like noiseless visions where we willed,
Up hill and down, till we were spent,
Or by some patch of metal “spilled.”
Along the dustless roads one heard
The happy talk of twos and threes,
Who, sitting on their cycles, whirred
Past those who walked with regal ease ;
Mile after mile they gaily rode,
Along the level, up the rise;
And little cash they paid or owed,
For all their fun and exercise.
Then ev’ry fellow had his “bike,”
And ev’ry maiden her “machine” ;
The farthest spot a man might strike
Saw bicycles and lovers lean ;
Tb° clerk and squatter’s son were one
So far as nickel-plating shone.
But, ah! those dustles3 days are done!
The push-bike has forever gone.
I wooed her next when motor-cars
Puffed dearly down suburban ways,
And burnt rank petrol to the stars.
I did not go with her those days,
But watched her sadly from the path,
And worshipped in my rival’s dust.
This was the push-bike’s aftermath!
Lacking a car, my dream was bust!
Oh, curse the gas combustion fiend
Who substituted valves for legs!
Since she and I together leaned,
Old Time has drained Youth to the dregs.
Throned in her husband’s latest car,
To-day I saw her proudly drive.
I sighed and sneered, “How fat you are!
We kept in trim in ’Ninety-Five.”

Melbourne Akgus reported the intrusive
presence of “a ferocious-looking shark, 10ft.
long,” among the bathers at Hampton Beach
(Melbourne), the other Sunday. It is most
unfair; sharks of mild, benevolent aspect
never get any newspaper notice.
The deserted harbor of Portland (Vic.) is
about to develop its long-shelved heritage
as a result of the pressure brought upon
Premier Watt by his country supporters and
the Decentralisation League. The State Gov-
ernment proposes to spend £266,000 during
the next three years. This money will go
towards erecting a breakwater to stop the
force of the rare S.E. gales (the only wind
that disturbs the placid waters of the de-
spised port), to construct new railway yards
and sheds and to enlarge the present pier.
Recognising that it would be useless to do
all this without goinc the whole hog, the
powers have decreed that the iniquitous
preferential rates shall go overboard from
January 1. If Watt wants to collect hand-
some interest on the money to be spent, he
might keep a watchful eye on the vacant
Government lands in the vicinity. Applica-
tion will soon be made to throw these blocks
open for sale, in which case, of course, good
old Pirate Enterprise will collar all future
unearned increment. WilUe Watt ought to
know a trick worth two of that.

“A Deceived Woman” writes to Melbourne

compelled by law to wear wedding rings.
She admits that to wear a finger ring might
interfere with the occupation of some men,
and to get over this difficulty proposes ear-
rings. But why not nose rings?

opportunity offered they were filled, but when they
were opened in about a year’s time, the grain was
found musty and unfit for use. In 1848 the island
was proclaimed a place for the detention of locally-
convicted prisoners. And the “bottles” were used
as punishment cells. Some of the most notorious
scoundrels in Australia have been confined on the
island. Frank Gardiner and Owen Saffolk (“the
prison poet”) met there. The discovery of gold
brought an influx of criminals, and that was Cocka-
too’s most crowded moment. At one time it had
80b prisoners. Prior to separation, Melbourne crim-
inals with long sentences were detained there. The
Fitzrov Dock was hewn out bv tb s labor. In the
mid-’so’s the place was abandoned as a gaol, but
after some years the old place was re-opened as a
penitentiary for women and short-sentenced pris-
oners. In these latter days it was officially called
Biloela, but the nrett.v-regular inhabitants r,resisted
in referring to it more or less affectionately as
“The Island.”
A bright boy was up before the Children’s
Court in Melbourne the other dav, charged
with stealing mulberries from the tree. The
accuser was stern and wild, the accused
patient but resolute for the right. He swore
he was not a guilty boy ; he declared on his
oath and his honor that he had not eaten
Gink’s mulberries. “When I accused you
before the constable of stealing the fruit,
why didn’t you deny it?” snorted the com-
plainant. “How could I,” replied accused
contemptuously, “when I had me mouth
full?”
The New York Labor Bulletin (Sept.,
1912) gives the latest available figures of
membership of trades unions of the world.
Germany heads the list with 3,042,203; Great
Britain and Ireland are close up with
3,010,340. Then comes the United States,
with 2,162,920; and , France, with
1,029,238. Australia is seventh on the list,
with 171,395 (this was at the end of 1910
and 15 unions in South Aus. had not fur-
nished returns to the Commonwealth Statis-
tician). The Australian unionists numbered
altogether about 326,270 less than those of
New York.
EVERY DOG HAS HIS DAY.
“But why do you keep calling me Arthur?
Didn't I letl you my name was Charlie!"
“Of course! How stupid of me! But I keep

From a man who sticks to solid earth :
A few months ago it was insisted that the aero-
plane should be made one of the bulwarks of our
Defence scheme. Since then two wars have
drenched a considerable area of country with blood ;
and how has the flier fared? The Italians at Tripoli
had the services of both aeroplanes and dirigible
war balloons—and neither of them has been worth a
single gun. True, a dirigible flew over some Turkish
camps and dropped bombs, but hastily decamped
when the Turks let loose a flight of fire balloons.
Ihe aeroplanes proved quite useless. Two fliers were
wounded by rifle fire and died; one went out and
was never heard of again. When the Balkan ball
started Bulgaria promptly snavelled every airman
that could be engaged. There were about 15 of
them at Sofia before the war started. Very little
has been heard of them since. They did practically
nothing. One, a Frenchman, flew over Adr'anople
and dropped circulars telling them the Turkish
Empire was overthrown, and it was useless to hold
ont any longer. He did it three times, and then he
had such a narrow escape his nerve gave way. He
failed to discover any information of real value.
Another went out to reconnoitre, was shot, and feli
inside the Turkish lines. He was dead when the
Turk# got him. At Chatalja several attempts were
made to gather information in this wav. and ev»rv
one of them failed. Unfortunately, the' Bulgars did
not have any dirigibles, otherwise something might
have been done. As a fighting force the aeroplane
is valueless, because it cannot hover. Neither can
it carrv enough ammunition to produce demoralisa-
tion. Its only service in war is. apparently, to attack
and destroy the great, unwieldy dirigibles. These latter
have proved that they can be operated in divisions,
but they are as frail as mosquitoes. A sudden breath
of wind may produce disaster. And £25,000 worth
of dirigible can be destroyed in a few minutes by a
couple of Are balloons costing no more than £25
each. Modern war is very deadly, but its extra mor-
tality, judging by these two latest war=. is due to
improvements in the shrapnel and artillery. As
for aerial craft, at their present stage of develop-
ment, they don’t amount to a row of pins.
Good old Joe Miller, yon can’t kill him
even at Christmas, when nearly everything
seems much more fatal than usual! For in-
stance, Sydney Evening News reports
(26/12/’l2) :
Joseph Miller, an engineer, was found dead with
his throat cut in Brisbane. His condition is critical.
This seems, moreover, to supply an answer
at lavt f 0 the old conundrum- —-“Does death
end all?”
South Aus. is still floating atop of a wave
of prosperity. Firewood is dear and domes-
tic service unpopular—two sure signs that
the farmers’ families have plenty of cash —-
and houses in and about Adelaide are still
hard to rent, in spite of the unceasing build-
ing. Another sign has been dug up by the
Salv’army, which was asked by the corpora-
tion of Kensington and Norwood —two popu-
lous suburbs —to supply names for Christ-
mas cheer. The Army fairly hunted for
candidates, but in all that district of three
square miles it could find only one family
that needed any help with the Christmas
dinner.
There are one or two exceptions; but
judging by the men who are getting the poor
little gaud, C.M.G. stands for Can’t Make
Good.
“Q u i i) s ter” sug-
gests a new Public
Department:—
Instruction in all the
arts of the cracksman is
devoid of definiteness,
and except, where fiction
goes into details, or the
police are communica-
tive, very little real help
is afforded a man who
wants to adopt burglary
as a profession. The re-
sult is that independence
of thought and original-
ity are fostered. S i r
Conan Doyle’s descrip-
tions of Sherlock Holmes’s
methods are doubtless
helpful to the profes-
sional housebreaker, but
it would be far better if
books of instruction were
published showing defi-
nite plans, and laying
down the right profes-
sional principles. This
would make it ever so
much easier for our over-
worked police. There
would perhaps be more
thieves, but there would
certainly be more cap-
tures. The issue of in-
structions to the police
on “How to catch bur-
glars” has been suggest-
ed ; but this would be
useless. Apart from the
fact that every burglar
would get hold of a copy
with scant difficulty, and
know what to do to still
avoid arrest, there is the
greater difficulty that no
writer of sufficient genius
has been found. No ;
what is wanted is to
guide the burglar's mind
gradually and cautiouslv,
even artfully, so that he
will not suspect he is

flannelette, which is about as dangerous
as lysol and as sudden in its attack as a
tiger snake, has been before the British
Boaid of trade once more. In one recent
month 128 deaths occurred through its
agency in the Cold Country, and the evi-
dence taken at most of the inquests went to
show that the thing will (lame or explode if
brought near an open light or fire. Attempts
to abolish it have failed, efforts to have it
labelled “Poison” or branded “Danger,” or
declared a noxious weed, have been turned
down ; and now the proposal to give it an-
other name which would dissociate it in the
public mind from honest flannel seems also
to be scouted. The authorities believe that
by this time there is a suggestion of danger
associated in the public mind with the pre-
sent name, and that this advantage would
be lost if it were called anything else. But
in this the Board is wrong. What, for in-
stance, if it were rechristened “Inflamma-
blette”?

THE DISQUALIFIED NURSE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
My Ruth’s eye had a merry twist;
She wore a dress of tender grey,
With linen bands at throat and wrist.
But I have loved and run away,
And warn all men, avoid the curse—•
Be not enamored of a nurse!
Ruth nursed a child with measles smit—
I know how sweet and kind she’d be.
In her off hours the dear would flit
To nestle in a nook with me.
It was a foolish thing to do—
Behold, I took the measles too.
Dear Dark Eyes had a patient old,
With influenza sore oppressed,
And when she met me I was bold,
And long and lovingly caressed
Her soft brown hair, her hand like snow
Till influenza laid me low!
My darling nursed a septic case,
And we were still affectionate.
I hugged her for a little space—
Diphtheria was my sorry fate.
Yes, Ruth was kind. Unlike the Dutch,
Her fault was that she gave too much.
We speak no more, no longer meet;
The coolness ’tween is deep and wide,
And if I see her in the street
I pass by on the other side.
She’s nursing now, her friends aver,
A poor bubonic sufferer.

“Searchlight” : For pine .commend me to
the eastern portion of the Dorrigo plateau (N.S.W.).
All through the scrub millions of feet of hoop pine
are pushing a way skywards. It is . a curious thing
about the members of this family that they must
top through the scrub and get a breath of higher
atmosphere on their own. Saw a pine recently
which cut nearly 9000 ft. of first-class timber; also
I measured four within 100 yards, all of which were
over 10ft. in waist measurement, and their neckties
of birds’-nests ferns were from 90ft. to 110 ft. from
the ground. These trees were as straight as a
Wowser parson would like to be able to truthfully
say-his past was, and reached higher heavenward

another big lot still waiting to be turned into bread

forlorn limb on which to deposit a few stray sticks

Dear Bulletin,—l propose to fill a long-
felt want. Driven by an inveterate curse, I read
all kinds of alleged newspapers, and the most per-
sistent I find is “Hints to Housekeep-
ers, ‘Cookery Recipes,” and such-like matter,
i ow, will you believe me when I say that in not
one instance is the Mere Bloke catered for? Hence
I set down the good things of a long and hilarious
experience:—•
£rnPfw« y + S i? UP *r -Tak . e two kidne - v ’ s ( if you haven’t
got two take the only one you have left), a small
piece of celery, a pickled onion, salt, pepper, bread
sardines, cheese; chew small; soak in beer, stout or
lager for three-quarters of an hour. Don’t fry the
beer; allow it to simmer on the ice. Serve in
g no glass available, buckets will do.
Bubble and Squeak.—About 13 whiskies and
curacoa. Add enough water to cover them, pepper
with spice (Shepherd Kings of Canterbury brand for
preference). When thoroughly cooked, turn out
(generally about 5 a.m.). The squeak will last for
nearly 12 hours afterwards.
Corned Goods.—Cut a large piece of salary ; chop
up for three hours. Mix with some hot stuff, in-
cluding cigars, garters, the unfinished pickles (do
you know that one?), hiccups, one cab. Top off
with powdered chorus girl. If this doesn’t corn
you, it s time to have medical advice.
Boiled.—Make a good gravy of absinthe (which,
as some chef once said, makes the jag last longer)
and brandy. Season with yip-i-addv-i-ay; stir fre-
quently with hair-curl. Brown (and the rest of the
gang) in the bar until thoroughly done. Put out
to cool for the night.
Mock Duck. —Elderly barmaid mixed with cham-
pagne. Usual dressing; and not too lean.
Lemon Trifle.—Slice a lemon into 16 parts. Place
each part in goblet; add rum, cloves and other
herbs. Get busy.
Game.—Take just-one-more, served in 17 pubs; a
bit of lash; roll out and stiffen. Can be basted
with a baton to advantage. Stir up and bail out
at dawn.
Tart (very expensive).—One “srood-night” (but-
tered) ; two dozen oysters ; two bottles of stout (bull-
dog, if nothing fiercer is handy) ; two hearts (beat
together and leave to cool) ; done brown, of course.
These arc a few of my choice Recipes for Blokes.
My book, containing 466 others, will be forwarded
on receipt of twelve (12) stamps.—Yours cordially,

“San Dido”: The York (W.A.) mountain
devil is a queer creature. It is a fearsome-looking
kind of lizard, which resembles nothing so much as
a prickly cucumber, and is about as dangerous. I
first kept one some years ago, and tied it up to a
stick with a string attached to its prickly tail. It
neither ate nor drank for over two months, and I
would have treated it as they do the suffragettes
on a hunger strike but for the amazing fact that it
kept growing fatter. One morning I found four
large eggs and a dead devil. I have tried to keep
several since, but they have all gone the way of the
first. I have also known of several attempts to take
them to the Eastern States, but the pangs of leaving
their ’Groper State have been too much for them.
* * * *
“Kodak”: Summer is here, and with it
the cloud of small, futile summer things that suicide
in and round lighted lamps. I am not learned in
insect lore, and my religion has worn thin. These
things may have their uses in the scheme of Creation ;
but personally I fail to see where they fit in. Per-
haps I only observe them at their
worst —that is to say, when they
are under the influence of kero-
sene. A silly arrangement just
fell on to my writing pad with
a crash. Being only about as big
as a baby mosquito, I guess it
had to descend with a crash to
make itself heard at all. Well,
this new arrival consists of a
long, transparent body, six legs,
two feelers, or horns, and un-
limited energy. It uses its six
legs to run on, except when it
wants to scratch its stomach.
Then it walks on the last pair
and scratches with the front four.
The powerful wings are not used
for flight, but merely to turn
immense back somersaults. The
way it doesn’t proceed is curious.
First it runs furiously forward
for a distance of three inches;
then, with an ear-splitting shriek
and a remark about having for-
gotten its umbrella, it throws a
long-distance back - somersault,
which takes it to where it started
from, or some spot still further
to the rear. At intervals, it
stands on its face, and using
its wings as propellers, spins at a bewildering
rate. This may indicate either excessive joy or
ungovernable fury. Or perhaps that is the way it
thinks. ... Still, after 10 minutes’ close study, I’ve
decided that, at least, it is no madder than party
government.
“Pick”: “Mimosa” (B. 5/12/T2) wants
to know the Australian record distance travelled
by a grass-fed horse between daylight and sundown.
Well, I dunno ; but hurrying for a doctor from the
McLaughlin River to Bombala, and then repeating
the same weary journey for medicine, I once, to save
his owner’s life, put a famous Monaro stock-horse,
named Sambo, over 112 miles between sunset and
breakfast time. The horse’s record was a good one,
and mine was a bit better, for I had ridden another
prad over 30 miles before setting out to bring the
doctor. A small pony was once driven by a friend
of mine, hastening to his father’s death-bed, from
Moruya to Greenwich Park, with but one hour’s halt
on the way. That is 120 miles, with Nelligen Moun-
tain to face in the middle of the flutter.
“Wandi”: “Briefless” (B. 21/11/T2)
says he wouldn’t advise anyone to try eating fresh-
water turtle, and infers that the flesh of the amphi-
bian is deadly poisonous. Well, I have eaten it on
the Richmond River (N.S.W.), and was under the
impression that it did me good. I have also eaten
the beast’s eggs, dug out of the sand. In the district
mentioned, turtle formed quite a considerable item in
the blackfellow’s dietary. Catching the beast is an
interesting job usually passed on to the gins and pic-
caninnies, who tread about looking for it in reedy
swamps where the shellbacks can’t easily escape.
“Genung”: We had travelled together
from Wagga to Albury, and had become friendly.
“You can tell by close observation,” he was saying,
“what part of Australia a man has lived in for many
years. The city-bred man looks ahead of him. He
never watches the ground. He knows there are no
stumps or stones or mud-holes about the pavement.
When you see a man raise his feet horizontally every
step, you can bet he comes from the West Coast of
Tasmania. He is used to dragging his feet out of
the mud. If his hand’s always holding on to his
hat he hails from Wellington or Warrnambool, the
two windy corners of Australasia. If his eyes are
always glued on the ground a yard ahead of him,
his home is in South Gippsland, where you see snakes
even after a Rechabite bun scruff. If a man tears
his tobacco from the plug instead of cutting it, his
habitat for some time has been quod, where pocket
knives are not to be had. If he is always screwing
down his eyes to tiny points, he has lived for many
years on the glaring Western Plains. If you see a man
fall asleep in the street, you can place him as a citi-
zen of Hobart, Geelong or Albany. If he is always

brushing his hand across his mouth, he lives in the
Mallee. He is wiping imaginary beer from his lips.”
“Say, if he comes from Adelaide?” I asked; “you
know, l come from Adelaide.” He moved quietly to
the far corner of the car, buttoned up his coat,
wrapped his rug around him, and watched me sus-
piciously all the rest of the journey.
"Ru”: The bullock team still has its
uses, but it is hardly the sort of vehicle you would
enter in a race against lightning. Yet, as a plain,
cold fact, a bullock-waggon loaded with wool beat
the wire in a race from Sunny Corner (N.S.W.) to
Piper’s Flat, and got to the Flat before the bul-
locky’s own message to say that he was leaving the
Corner. I didn’t know before that Spot and Baldy
could beat the wire, though, of course, I knew that
a swift goat or turtle or something might facilitate
its delivery after it had arrived at the local office.
Love’s young dream in the
Backbloeks takes some quenching. Was riding
across-country in South Gippsland (Vic.) one damp,
drizzling day in winter. The hills were hid in a
mist of white rain, and the wind would freeze the
marrow where I found them. She wore the striped
print dress, with bonnet to match, that marks che
peri in the Cocky’s Paradise—-the cow yard. The
youth’s manly form was hidden in a suit of dun-
garees. They were seated close together on a log
in true lover-like fashion, and half enveloped in
steam. The ingenious Romeo had built a break-
wind of scrub at the log-end and in front of the
rough Cupid-throne there blazed a great fire of such
dry wood as he had been able to gather. The steam
rose in clouds from their damp clothes, while the
wind howled through the gaunt gums and the rain
blanketed the hills. I breathed “good luck’’ to them
from the saddle as I topped the rise and shook the
reins for home and dry clothes. They deserved it.

ritory’s river flats, mention couch grass as one of the
present occupiers. Well, if I know anything about
couch grass (and after some years
farming in coastal Bananaland, I
think I do), it will remain in oc-
cupation long after the last weary
agriculturist has given up fighting
the vegetable and taken perman-
ently to beer. As a pasture I
have nothing to say against couch.
It is the best of the Northern grasses
comes early, stays late, and fat-
tens tock as quickly as Willis
ejects members. But in farming
plots on loamy river banks it is
about as welcome as the Devil at
a mothers’ meeting. The more
you work your land the quicker
the dreadful pest grows—which
characteristic applies equally, I
believe, to the Devil. Working
with plough and harrows will en-
sure a couch grass paddock in
record time. Acres of land that were
formerly cultivated on the Queens-
land coast are now unemployed in the farming sense,
owing to couch and its thousand-times more damn-
able relation—nut grass.
“The Pip”: My immigrant has come—
and gone. I set him to a few old jobs about the
orchard, and an hour later went to see how he was
progressing. I found him surrounded by a heap of
apples, which he had split with his jack-knife. He
said that, at the High Commit sioner’s office, they
had assured him that there was money in apples in
Australia.
THE SONG OF THE BUCCULENT BIVALVE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A deputation connected with the oyster industry
complained to the Minister that the president of the
Marine Board, when approached on the matter, con-
fessed, “I do not know anything about oysters ”
Brisbane Courier.
He knew not of its pensive moods,
Its sad communings with the sea,
When, prescient of Fate, it broods
Upon the time when it shall be,
For its own succulent sweet sake,
A garnish for the Dago steak.
He knew not of the frenzied grief
That bids it shed a bivalve tear
To give its aching heart relief
And (later on) adorn the ear
Of some fool-mortal’s girl of girls,
Whose taste is one that runs to pearls.
He did not know the raging hate
The undeluded oyster hath
For those who seek him on a plate
With English stout, as aftermath
Of too much meeting of the lips
On up- or down-the-river trips.
He nothing knew, this bold marine,
Of oysters or their subtle ways
But here suspicion creeps between—
he held that silence pays,
And, with a tongue stuck in his cheek,
Resolved, like oysters, not to squeak!

I uri-Puri”: Here’s a queer case which
I won t attempt to explain. About four years ago
I paid a brief visit to the Uaria River gold diggings.
To reach them from Tamata, the nearest settlement,
I had to take a long 12 days’ walk through moun-
tainous country, covered with dense tropical scrub.
At the time I write of, some 10 or 12 miners were
working at the diggings; and as they were scat-
tered over a large tract of country, communica-
tion between them was infrequent. Their mails and
stores were brought up from Tamata by native car-
riers at irregular intervals. After visiting the most
distant camp, 1 started on the return journey to
Tamata. On the way I met a few miners. They
all asked me when Mr. (say) Brick —an ex-member
of the Papuan Civil Service, who had worked in the
Tamata district—had died. I was bewildered when
the question was first nut to me, and began to
wonder how the news had reached the Uaria, as I
was the last person to come up from Tamata, and
no such news had reached me there prior to my de-
parture for the diggings. After some inquiry I
learned that the news had originated with the
natives at the camp of a miner lower down the
river, and that this miner had passed it on. I in-
terrogated the natives at the camp of origin, but
they were very reticent as to the source of their
information. They, however, told me that Mr.
Brick was dead, and that he had met with a violent
death. On reaching Tamata some days later, I
inquired of the only two white men there as to
their knowledge of the matter, and as to whether
anybody had arrived at Tamata during my absence.
They were as much astonished at hearing, the news
as I had been, so I knew from this that no person
had arrived whilst I was away. They also told me
that during my absence from Tamata nobody had
left that place for the Uaria diggings, neither had
they received any letters for the miners working
there; and as one of the men at Tamata was the
store manager and agent generally for the miners,
he was in a position to know. As Buna Bay, the
nearest white settlement, lay south six days’ walk-
ing and two days’ steaming from Tamata, and as
THE SHIFTING STEAK.
"Butcho" : “Rump steak's up again, mum."
MRS. BROWN : "Up agin, is it! Well, Lor'
knows where yer cuttin' it from now. The
last I had was off the neck."
the folk there depended solely for news on the mails
brought from Samarai, 300 miles away, it would
have been impossible for the information as to Mr.
Brick’s death to have reached us by overland mes-
senger from Buna Bay, before the arrival of the
steamer at Tamata. Again, it could not have come
by wire, as I’apua has no telegraphs. Therefore any
idea that the information reached the Uaria from
an outside source was impossible. About four weeks
after my return to Tamata, the mail steamer ar-
rived, bringing information that word had been
received in Samarai from Australia, a few days
before the steamer sailed, that Mr. Brick had
met with a violent death in a certain town in far-
away Victoria, about the time I was at the Uaria
diggings. The papers received by the following mail,
a month later, confirmed the information.
CUSTOMERE : “ Hi, waiter, this confounded steak has teeth marks in it ."
WAITER: “Oh, dear no, sir. ’ Tain't possible, sir. The prevyis gent hadn’t no teeth, sir.”
“Gringo : The Tasmanian cocky is as
mean as any. Through various accidents I was
driven to seek work of one of them, and was
engaged for the cowyard at 15s. a week and tucker.
When gently demurred at the small-
nes of the money, Cocky told me he
had had men waiting in the paddock
before daylight to take 10s. a week.
There was nothing for me to say after
that. I had 35 cows to milk, and be-
tween “cow-times” was expected to
work in the paddock, grubbing, etc.
The job lasted me three days; and
when I quitted the old man (who
said he liked me) expressed honest
surprise at my leaving “a good home
and a steady job.” The next place
was better —-a pound a week, superior
food and accommodation and fewer
cows. However, the job had one
drawback, in the shape of the old
lady of the house. She was an early
riser. In the dark, cold winter morn-
ings she would be up and about, and
in order to rouse the men of the place
the toughened old battler would chase
the fowls from their roosts long be-
fore cock-crow, and then shoo them
with shrill shrieks which penetrated
to our hut and made us writhe in our
cosy chaff-bag beds. The old woman
went awaj r for a time, and her place
was taken by a married daughter, who
was just as keen. In the dreary, dis-
mal hour before dawn this unnatural
woman would pace up and down in
front of the hut, nursing her baby
and crooning “Ba-aby’s out be-fo-ore
the men, isn’t she?” repeating the
words with such painful deliberation
that we had to get out of our bunks.
In this island my experience has been that the poorer
the cocky the fairer he is towards those whom he
employs, paying better wages and giving superior
food.

“L’Fou” : Another instance of the social
status of the cow comes from Towong (Vic.). At
the local Shire Council’s last meet’ng, Cr. Scobie
(referring to a certain ratepayer): “As to ‘loafing’
sheep, he is the champion loafer on the Valley.”
Cheerful acquiescence on the part of brother coun-
cillors. Report of shire dairy inspector read at the
same meeting: “The use of fattening types of cattle
for the dairy, or of regular scrubbers, is a very
glaring mistake in this shire.” The president (Cr.
Cronin), with indignation: “The dairy inspector must
be more particular in his choice of language. I
take exception to the word ‘scrubber,’ which is a
vulgar expression. The inspector should moderate
his language a bit.” “Champion loafer” sounds a
much worse beast than a mere “scrubber” ; but evi-
dently these cow-country councillors reckon it doesn’t
matter what they call their brother-man so long as
no offensive epithets are cast at their heroine, Mrs.
Cow.
“Leo Lear”: I pass “Blue E.” (B.
3/10/’l2) the right paw of good fellowship for
cursing the imported starling pest, though it is not
as a fruit-eater that I am at enmity with the bird
and his seed for ever. As a consumer of plums, etc.,
starlings are an annoyance, but as enemies of valu-
able Australian birds the black-skinned vermin are
likely to become a national calamity. In most parts
of Victoria the grimy swaggerers roam in mobs,
droves or packs, bullyragging by weight of numbers
decent Australian citizens. Native birds haven’t
gone in for compulsory military training, and are no
match for the invading hordes. The pugnacious
foreigners oust from their nesting-places parrots,
kookaburras, pardalotes, owls and other birds whose
ladies earn their bonus in hollow trees. Anyone
would think there were enough holes to go round,
but starlings are increasing so fast that in many
districts four or five families occupy one hollow
branch, on the suburban-flat system, and any new
villa is taken before the carpenters are out of the
house. Thus our own birds are evicted and will
decrease, and the insect pests they prey on will
increase like the woes of Job, and the name of the
imported starling will be anathema, also mud.

“Albury”: From “Australian Reminis-
cences,” an account of one of Leichhardt’s expedi-
tions, published by Daniel Bunce in 1857, I extract
a passage which gives Black Brother more credit
than he usually gets for one of his talents. The
incident occurred in Queensland, and is related as
follows:—-
Among the blacks who returned yesterday was one
who made his debut at our camp in the character of a
wandering minstrel, singing as he went, or rather as
he approached, for want of thought, the old English
ballad:—
He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons,
He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons,
He promised to buy me a bunch of blue ribbons,
To tie up my iddle de fol do rol da.
Black Brother had forgotten the words of the old
song, but he improvised a suitable line to supply the
hiatus. Mr. Bunce was a poor commentator on such
things, and let it go with a mere statement of the
facts.
* * * *
“Flinderino” and a search for lost trea-
sure :
When crossing a bore-stream in the Longreach
district (Q.), we noticed an old battler wandering
about in the bulrushes along the side of the stream.
We concluded that he was looking for another
Moses, or something. A week later, when recrossing,
we saw the old hatter still about the same spot
This time he was prodding the stream with a long
sapling. Evidently Moses hadn’t yet been located.
Being curious, we interviewed the apparent lunatic,
and he had a truly sorrowful tale to tell. Some
months previous, when a neighboring shed cut
out, he had the usual drunk, but pulled himself up
in time to save a five-pound note, which he planted
in his boot for safe custody. Some weeks later,
when camped alongside this stream, he picked up a
discarded pair of bluchers which fitted him, and were
better than the ones he was wearing; so, rejoicing at
the find, he tossed the old boots into the bulrushes
and continued on his long tramp to the coast. The
battler was 200-odd miles on the journey when the
thought struck him all of a heap.’ He had thrown
away the 200 drinks! Doubling on his track, he
walked much overtime and did many short cuts, and
then the search began. At time of last inspection
it was still proceeding, and seven derelicts were
camped near-by, anxiously awaiting results.
‘•Eddyson”: Finn marched into Mrs.
Hopp’s kitchen at Nine Mile. He was wearing his
best, creased from long seclusion in the candle-box
under the bunk, and with bed fluff along
the folds. In Finn’s buttonhole was an adult
hollyhock of purple hue. “I’m thinkin’ we’ll
be married, ma’am,” said Finn peremptor-
ily. Mrs. Hopp dropped her dough, and
stared at Jimmy in open-mouthed wonder. “Ye
bether hurry, ma’am,” said Finn. “His rivrince
may be lavin’ widin the hour.” “But—but,” fal-
tered the widow. “ ’Tisn't any time fer buttin’
ma’am. Will yeh be puttin’ on yer hat this min-
ute?” Mrs. Hopp stiffened her back. “I will not,
Mister Finn,” said she. “You will not!” Finn’s
words were scarcely more than a whisper. “You will
not, ma’am!” This time it was a pig squeal. “You
will not!” Finn trumpeted like a bull elephant.
“And for what have I put on me good clothes, then,
will yeh be tellin’ me? Fer what have I th’ flower
be me coat ’n’ th’ ring in me ftst?” “You never
axed me t’ marry yeh, Mr. Finn, yeh didn’t.”
“Never axed yeh, never ax— Fer what did I
bring yeh th’ plucked chicken a fortnit come Chews-
dee! Never axed yeh! Have yeh no sinse at all,
then? Fer whoi did I bring yeh the pot-plant be
the windy” (Finn seized the wilted geranium in the
battered fruit tin) “’n’ the whistle fer the b’y?”
Finn secured the tin whistle from the shelf. “I
hadn’t the shmallest idear, man,” protested Mrs.
Hopp. “Hadn’t the shmallest idea, ’n’ you a widdy
woman, wid the knowledge iv men! Fer whoi
would a man be bringin’ yeh apples ? Tell me that! ”
Finn seized the apples of which Mrs. Hopp was
about to make her pudding, and placed them with
the trophies at his feet. “ ’Tis very innercent you
are, ma’am, but min don’t give chiny tavpots fer
nothin’.” Finn commandeered the teapot. “Nor col-
lyflowers, nayther.” Two cauliflowers were added
to the collection, and Finn raved round the kit-
chen.” “Didn’t ax yeh, sez you, ’n’ me very
pickther iv th’ blessed Pope himself starin’ yeh in
the face, ma’am!” The framed print went on the
pile. “For whoi did I give yeh the mustache cup,
ma’am, ’n’ not be wantin’ t’ marry yeh?” “I don’t
know, Mister Finn, so I don’t,” says the widow,
firin’ up. “Devil a mustache have I, beknownst t’
me.” “No, ma’am, but I have, ’n’ whoi else would
a man be givin’ a widdy a mustache cup, but fer
his own use? ’N’ I never axed yeh!” Finn
mimicked the widow’s tones, and the moustache cup
was added to the heap. Finn resumed possession of
a wicker basket, a black apron with woollen roses
worked on it, a bread plate, two tumblers and the
wretched remains of threepennywortli of peppermints.
“Never axed yeh,” he snorted, “ ’n’ me own arruin
chair stud there be yer fireside!” Finn recaptured
the chair. “No, yeh did not, Jimmy Finn, ’n’,
moreover, Harry Sprag—what’s a fine man dthrivin’
the traction —did; ’n’ I sez ‘Yes,’ sez I; ’n’ there
yeh have it, Jimmy Finn.” “Sprag!” roared Finn.
“Sprag! A rat iv a man, a dthried-up, bandy-
legged blackamoor. Marry yeh, will he? But,
ma’am, he’ll niver live t’ do ut. Never, ma’am!
Couldn’t I kill him with a punch ; ’n’ won’t I do
ut?” The light from the kitchen door was suddenly
blocked. A dense silence fell upon the party. Harry
Sprag was standing in the doorway. The silence
lasted a terrible half-minute, and Finn swayed on
his ankles, squirming painfully. “Good-day, Finn,”
said Sprag. “God-day t’ you, Misther Sprag,” said
Finn; “I hear yer bein’ married t’ th’ widdy ?”
“Yes. What of it?” “Nothin’, nothin’—nothin’ at
all, Misther Sprag. On’y I thought maybe” (Finn
held a small gold hoop out to Sprag, and his voice
broke pitifully)—“l was hopin’, man, maybe I could
be sellin’ you the weddin’ ring.”

“Tiaki”: Hori Ereora had just sold 10
acres as his share of the Matapihi block, and was
living at the rate of ten thousand a year for 10 days
or so. The Methodist storekeeper was advising Hori
to lead a less rapid life. But Hori had the land-
selling lust, and replied with scorn: “I kot te prenty
rand. I serrit if I rike. ’S my rand, I serrit if I
want. I serra Maupuna, Rakauroa. I 'semi my sair
in Okurupatu an’ my sair in Waiu; I puy te motor-
car, an’ ten I take te trip home to te ole tart.”
The trip to the old dart was Hori’s acme of desire.
That was only two or three years ago. He was
penning up sheep in a white man’s shed when I saw
him the other day. The only “old tart” he ever
saw was the one who patches his dungarees. Henare
Heihei was the champion accordion squeezer of the
Puroa district. He tells it this way: “One tay te
fresh pakeha ferra cum’ to me an’ he say, ‘You pray
te korian?’ I terrim ‘Oh, yes, a pit, you know.’ He
say, ‘I rike you to pray for te fonokraf, s’pose you
toan’ mine.’ I terrim I toan’ care if he rike it.
Werra, I pray for te fonokraf. I pray te ‘Merry
Witta Wolls’ an’ te ‘Pru Pell Seotran’ sottise, an’ ten
te pakeha say, ‘Now, you rissen.’ Py kore! Te
fonokraf he pray ’em prurry site petter ’an I kin
pray ’em myself!”
“Dogagi” : I will back the Papuan iguana
to stand more punishment before being counted out
than any other member of the tribe. Accompanied
by some natives, I recently visited the scrub country
to the north-west of Yule Island. Whilst walking
along a native pad the boys espied a go. up a tall
elimo tree. First shot go. got a .303 bullet. He
slipped a few feet down his vegetable, but continued
to hold on. Three more shots failed to dislodge him,
but the next did the trick, and he fell to earth. Re-
covering himself he made for another tree, but be-
fore he could get out of reach one of the boys seized
him by the tail. He turned on his enemies, showed
fight, and had to have more lead pumped in. On
examination I found that the six shots fired had
hit him. He was Bft. long from the tip of his nose
to the end of his tail. The natives undressed him,
and after they had replenished their pantries we re-
sumed our walk.

Poet Bernard O’Dowd, librarian at the
Melbourne Law Courts, has been appointed
chairman of the Fibrous Plaster Wages
Board. He’ll be delivering judgment in
verse after this form: —
Bread that is cast on the stream floats backward anon
to the caster.
What is this life but a dream of a future award?
Fibrous the nerves of the soul, and fibrous the body
of plaster;
Death to the workers of ill, by the Law of the Lord—
Fixed are the wages of sin by the mightiest Board.
Concerning an energetic citizen, de-
ceased :—•
A picturesque record came to an end at Wan-
ganui (M.L.) last week with the death of Neville
Hale Thornton, soldier of fortune, hero, artist, jour-
nalist, and a few other things. In his first-named
capacity he fought with the French army under
MacMahon in the Crimea, and was decorated with
the Cross of the Legion of Honor by Louis Napoleon
for heroically replacing the tricolor on a parapet
during a French assault on the key to the Redan.
He managed to do this just before the Russians shot
him in the groin, broke his jaw and fractured his
chest-bone, besides handing him a few minor souve-
nirs. Later, he went out to Algiers, with
a commission in the Chasseurs, but knocked
up in health and transferred himself to Australia.
He saw service with the N. S. Wales mounted
police, under Major Broughton, having command of
six black trackers at Murrumbidgee; was at Lamb-
ing Flat as a storekeeper and baker; did some
mining, bush carpentering, tutoring—anything. After
a few years he moved on to Maoriland, where he
made some fame as a scenic artist. Actress Amy
Vaughan is a daughter of the old man, who at 77
years has given life best, after an unusually strenu-
ous experience.
John James, ex-M.L.A. of Victoria, passed
out at a remote township in Gippsland the
other day, aged 84. Though forgotten for
years, time Was, in the ’6o’s and ’7o’s, when
he was something of a political influence.
From ’6B to ’B6 he was member for East
Ballarat. In ’B6 Duncan Gillies gave him
the billet of Minister for Mines in his new
Cabinet, meaning to be kind. But when he
went to the electors they sacked him; and
that was the end of him politically.
Charles E. W. Bean (author of “On the
Wool Track,” etc.), who was despatched to
London about a year ago by S. M. Herald
as its correspondent in that bloated village,
will shortly return to the Sydney staff of
the paper. Arthur Mason, who was trans-
ferred to the leader-writing staff at head-
quarters from the London office to make
way for Bean, will return to his old job in
about two months’ time.
John Rowland Dacey, who died in har-
ness as Treasurer of N. S. Wales, is to have
a monument of imported red granite erected
to his memory. Public subscriptions (limited
to one < shilling) are doing the work. One of
Dacey’s first acts on coming across from
Victoria 25 years ago was to join the South
Sydney Protectionists, and a convinced
Protectionist he remained till he divided for
the last time. When Carruthers was cun-
ningly giving the State Labor Party the
backwash of the present Federal Tariff at
the 1907 elections, the situation found most
of the party apologetic. Not so Dacey.
“I’ll own it,” he said; “it’s good enough for
me.” He defended it, fought his election
largely on it, and finished with a majority
increased from 100 to 1000. A man like
that ought to have his memory preserved in
good Australian stone, hewn from, say, the
grey granite quarries of Moruya, or the red
granite sides of Gabo Island.
Whatever explosions may take place in
his surroundings, C. C. Lance, of Sydney
Harbor Trust, may be expected to be unin-
jured. The retirement of Hickson enables
the Government to remodel the Trust
and give the chairman more authority. Of
course Lance is the man chosen for
the job. Born in England a little
over 50 years ago, he studied en-
gineering there and did so well that S’Africa
invited him, and he did better. A mere
change of pursuit is no more to him than a
change of climate. While in S’Africa he
turned from engineering to produce-broking,
etc. Australia next invited him, and he
purchased a flour mill in Euroa (Vic.). He
was next known in dairying. He invented
several labor-saving machines in cow de-
partments, and wiry-whiskered men talked
of placing a figure of him over the gate of
their milking yards. That led him into the
management of Sydney’s Fresh Food Co. Then
he was appointed Government commercial
agent in England. But he loved Australia,
and after a few years bounded back, with-
out any definite appointment in view. The
Government promptly appointed him mem-
ber of the Harbor Trust. Now he goes up
top.
JUDGE McMILLAN' (W.A.) IS
SURPRISED.
W. C. Buchanan, a country member of
Maoriland’s House of Reps., was added to
the serried ranks of Knights Bachelors at
New Year. Thus a long and stubborn sup-
port of the Fat party in politics meets with
a fitting reward. Buchanan emigrated to
Melbourne from Scotland 55 years ago (he is
74 now). Thence, in 1863, he went to Maori-
land, settled on the land, and in time became
one of M.L.’s wealthy squatters. In 1881
he found his way into the Reps., and on and
off has been there ever since. As a politi-
cian he can be set down as Party Hack,
Class A. A few days ago he passed through
Australian ports on his way to London and
the branding yard.
Wagga, on the Murrumbidgee. the haunt

talked-about parson, the Anglican Rev. T. J.
Redhead. During the whole of his stay in
Wagga Redhead has foresworn the flesh-
pots of the mighty, and lived in a tent on the
Tarcutta-road ; and there wasn’t a deadbeat
or a sundowner for a hundred miles or so
who didn't know the way to the quaint
parsonage.

From the other end
Alan Burgoyne, of the Anglo-Australian wine trade,
one of the Young Conservative party in the British
House of Commons, specialises on naval matters, and
is quite ready to teach the veterans in the service a
bit of their business. The veterans, needless to say,
are not grateful. Thus, Admiral Charles Beresford
spoke at a club dinner lately: “A pretty pass things
have come to! Another book by young Burgoyne!
The British Navy’s actually floating on a sea of
Emu brand Australian wine!” The cruelty of the
gibe was unconscious. The Emu brand people, as it
happens, are the Burgoynes’ hated trade rivals, and
Admiral B. didn’t know it. He was advertising the
opposition firm.
The little South Aus. Directory yields its
quota of quaint names. There is a Yorkes
Peninsula township called Jerusalem. After
death the local cow goes to Heaven —he is
the butcher. In another part there is a
living Hell. She is a lady. Pennies are
common; Shilling, Twopenny, Dollar and
Brass are, of course, rarer. Among butchers
are two Bones, one Cheek, one Brawn, one
Skinner, and one Lean; and among police-
men one John. Cashman hangs his sign
over a money-to-lend emporium, and a black-
smith has built up a business under the
name of Mr. Blowes.
From the Oldest Inhabitant:—
On a recent Thursday, at Nicholson’s concert room,
Mrs. Duguid and her daughter spent an hour enjoy-
ing a musical afternoon and meeting friends. Mrs.
Duguid has lived close upon 89 years, 74 of them
in Australia. Mr. T. A. Dibbs was amongst the cal-
lers. Mrs. Duguid remembered him when he was a
lad in the service of the Commercial Banking Com-
pany of Sydney, of which Leslie Duguid was first
manager, and which Tom Dibbs joined in 1847. Evi-
dently “young Tom” looked to her in those days a
much more impressive person than he does now, after
nearly half a century as general manager; anyway,
she recalls that he “seemed most important, running
up and down with books under his arm.”
Gone from New Plymouth (M.L.)
to where all brave and useful
women go, Mrs. Mary Kelly, who
was one of Florence Nightingale’s
famous band of nurses in the cruel
Crimea war. After returning to
Britain from that campaign, she
emigrated to Maoriland and married
(for the second time), at 80, Ed-
ward Kelly, himself a Crimea
veteran, wearing the Crimean and
Turkish medals. Like so many of
grateful England’s heroic spirits,
these two died (within a few davs of each
other) in a benevolent institution. Mrs
Kelly was 91.
Rockefeller, the elderly, hairless man with
the endless bank account and the ruined
stomach, is once more in hiding. He is try-
ing to elude a subpoena calling him to ap-
pear before the Money Trust Investigation
Committee and tell how he got his useless
ocean of cash. If the committee wanted
him to < come and have a chat about his
dyspepsia, the hunted Sunday-school teacher
would crawl out of whatever hole he is in
and whiz towards it at 80 miles an hour
And, what is more, he would probably keep
going until the committee rushed him out
and shoved him down the lift shaft The
curse about this world is that it never wants
to telMt t^l ' ngs a G^ow is just bursting
Last Thursday, in Melbourne, Thomas
Chia. of Dragonland, and Eunice Russell,
of Australia, were made man and wife by
Canon Hughes, also of Australia. Subse-
quently the White Australian clergyman,
proposing the health of the pair, said “the
wedding was going to break down the insu-
lar prejudice of the English race, and would
tend to the blending of two nations.” Quite
so. Canon Hues !
A. L. Beattie. Chief Mechani-
cal Engineer for Maoriland
Railways, retires in March
after 36 years of railway toil,
chiefly in the Ricketty Isles.
Since he took over from Roth-
eram, the former C.M.E., he
has been kept pretty well on the
jump, for the Island State
builds all its own rolling stock.
After retiring, Mr. Beattie will
visit Australia and then settle
in Hawkes Bay on a farm —
the ambition of most railway
and seafaring men.
Such a physical handicap as
almost total deafness might
reasonably be expected to limit
a man's activities, but in the
case of Donald Robertson, secre-
tary of Maoriland G.P.0., and
shortly to begin his duties as
Chief Commissioner of the Civil
Service Board, there has been
no limitation. Not only has he
carried out his official duties
with distinction, but he has also
found time to invent various ap-
pliances to facilitate the work
of the G.P.O. His stamping
machine, which takes the letters
off a table, stamps them at the
rate of thousands a minute, and
then stacks them up ready for
the sorters, is far ahead of the machine in
use in Australia. In his office, Robertson
has the receiver of a table microphone
always at his ear, and gets along very
well that way.
Leonard Stowe, Clerk of Maoriland Par-
liaments, who was put into the C.M.G. pen
of “culls” when the New Year honors were
being distributed, has had a long experience
at his clerking job. He was secretary
to Thomas Carter and A. P. Seymour when
they were superintendents of Marlborough
province. Later, in 1864, he was clerk to
the local provincial council. A year later,
he was clerk to M.L.’s Legislative Council,
and in 1889 was promoted to his present
billet. In order to double-bank the tradi-
tions of the family, he married, in 1871, a
daughter of Dr. Greenwood, a former Ser-
geant-at-Arms in the M.L. House of R'eps.
“Looking Backward” among the tombs :
The Sydney daily papers’ revival of the hoary lie
which identifies Mrs. Reibey with Margaret Catchpole
is rightly denounced by “The Oldest” (B. 26/12/’l2).
The story was contradicted as long ago as 1858 by
the Rev. Richard Cobbold, rector of Wootham (Eng.).
Cobbold, who was a son of the John Cobbold whose
gelding Margaret Catchpole stole, wrote in the ’4o’s
the only authentic life
of the lady. In a sup-
plement to the life,
issued a dozen years
later, he corrected the
impression which
pretty generally pre-
vailed in Sydney re-
specting Mrs. Reibey’s
identity. He published
also a letter from
Bishop Broughton,
showing that he,
among others, had
thought that Mrs. Rei-
bey was Margaret
Catchpole. The error
arose apparently from
the fact that both
Mrs. Reibey and Mar-
garet Catchpole came
from Bury; but the
former was from Bury
in Lancashire and the
latter from Bury i n
Suffolk. “The Oldest”
is in error in saying
that Margaret died in
1819. That would
make her only 46,
whereas she died i n
1841, aged 68. She
married John Barry, a
wealthy gentleman who
had been a sweetheart
in earlier years, and
had one son and two
daughters. They re-
ceived “the best educa-
tion that England
could afford,” and r e-
turned to settle in
Australia. Edward
Catchpole, Margaret’s
brother, had an event-
ful career, one of his
adventures landing him
in a French prison.
He was mate on the
Argus revenue cutter,
which in 1807 rescued
a British coal-brig
from a French priva-
teer. Twelve hours
later the captor was
captured, and Catch-
pole was put in a
French fortress, where
he remained seven
years. He escaped sen-
sationally, and after-
wards became chief of

THE FATHER OF HIS PEOPLE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
In a distant land long ages gone,
The hoary story runs,
There lived a mighty monarch with
His wives and maids and sons ;
His progeny were numerous,
His wealth beyond belief ;
And struggling virtue found in him
Immediate relief.
He owned the rugged mountain pass,
He owned the verdant plain,
He owned the rivers and the hills
Throughout a vast domain ;
He owned the churches and the pubs,
He ran a gambling hell,
And everything that monarch did
He did exceeding well.
His fame increased ; his high repute
Eclipsed the noonday sun ;
And yet he wasn’t satisfied—
He’d only just begun
To feel the joys of living when
His soul was sore annoyed
By frequent deputations from
The local unemployed.
Their lamentations touched him;
He was moved by their distress;
They could live, they said, on little,
And their wives could live on less;
With his Majesty’s permission,
They would dig or sow or reap,
From the sunrise to the gloaming
For their residence and keep.
They bowed their heads and licked the stone
Whereon his feet had trod ;
The}' squirmed upon their stomachs like
The heathen to his god ;
They prayed he wouldn’t slay them
With his sabre or his dirk ;
They didn’t ask for money—
They were merely wanting work.
So he set them building pyramids
Of water and of sand,
And a-painting of the railings
Round the vacant plots of land ;
He drilled them in his armies,
And he sent them forth to fight
For their Monarch and their Country,
And for Godliness and Right.
And they fought with pious fervor
And they slew with might and main,
Till you couldn’t count the corpses
That were scattered on the plain.
And the King was so delighted
That he gave them leave to wear
Some bits of tin upon their chests
And feathers in their hair.
For those who fell in battle
He was seen to shed a tear,
And the few who didn’t perish
Were recompensed with beer.
And the wives and little children
Of the heroes who were dead
Were remembered by the Monarch
When his evening prayers were said.
Now, of course, so kind a ruler,
Should have lived for evermore;
But a discontented orphan
Went and spilt his precious gore;
And the “Father of his People”
Died a sudden kind of death
When the knife of an assassin
Caused a stoppage of his breath.
THOMAS BEASLEY.

The N. S. Wales Government continues
its furious unfinancial career. For the half-year, to the
end of December, 1912, it had a revenue of £7,475,329.
That was £208,156 more than the corresponding
half of the previous year yielded; but the expendi-
ture on Revenue account grew by no less than
£1,135,075. Put it this way:—
July-Dee., Revenue. Expenditure. Deficit.
1911 .. £7,267,173 *7,399,686 £132,513
1912 . . 7,475,329 8,534,761 1,059,432
It is a ghastly record of utter recklessness, which, if
it happened in connection with a private business,
would unquestionably cost the bankrupt his certifi-
cate, so that all the world might be warned not to
trust him to the extent of a penny-piece. And as
likely as not it would cost him a few months’ gaol
as well. In addition to thus living at the rate of
over £2,000,000 a year beyond its means, taking the
Revenue account only, the Loan account shows an
expenditure of £4,230,128, or £1,525,371 more
than for the corresponding half of 1911-12. Then
there was the expenditure from the Public Works
and Closer Settlement Funds. The whole dreadful
business works out in this way:—
Expenditure—
Revenue account .. .. £8,534,761
Loan account . . . . 4,230,128
Works account . . .. 593,675
Closer Settlement account 12,582
£13,371,146
Revenue 7,475,329
Expenditure in excess of revenue .. £5,895,817
That is for six months only. And this is the Govern-
ment which talked about honesty in finance, declared
that it would borrow nothing except for reproductive
undertakings, and actually introduced a Bill to pro-
vide for a sinking fund for all loans! In all the
history of N. S. Wales there has been no more reck-
less finance, and there have been no greater enemies
of the avowed ideals of the Labor party than the
traitorous crowd of political adventurers and place-
hunters and time-servers now in office.
Neither Victoria nor §. Aus. publishes
expenditure figures until the erid of the year, and
Westralia doesn’t publish figures l showing the expen-
diture on Loan account. The Treasury reports from
these States are, therefore, all lop-sided. The Vic-
torian revenue for the last six months was
£4,421,565, or £25,560 less than that for the first
half of 1911-12—a shrinkage for which the
railways are entirely responsible. The first taste of
drought did it. From the Commonwealth, which
virtually means from Customs, the State got
£833,826, or £39,300 more; and that growth is
almost as unsatisfactory a feature as the shrinkage
in railway revenue. The two together mean that
with less production to pay for things, the State is
buying more, and either using up its accumulations
or going into debt. The time is fast coming when
Australia will have to seriously reconsider its posi-
tion. There has been a lot of talk about the high
cost of living. It is time the whole country con-
sidered the cost of high living. Victoria counted the
cost once before, and partly paid it by metaphori-
cally sitting in sackcloth and ashes for a few years.

The Bank of New Zealand has two pretty
big schemes in hand. In the bad old days the bank
had to go to the Government for help—it was either
that or close the doors. The Government made an
advance, which was partly paid off later on. The
balance, £1,500,000, was allowed to stand —
£500,000 in permanent pref. shares; £1,000,000
at 4 p.c., repayable in 1914. The bank could next
year pay the million out of its own accumulations,
but doesn’t want to break into its resources, where-
fore a proposal is to be made to the Government to
renew the bill. Naturally the directors want the
loan again at 4 p.c. ; but, in view of the tighter
money market, they are not likely to get it.
The other scheme involves an increase of capital,
and will mean an amending Bill. At present the
paid capital is £500,000, with another £500,000
callable. The idea is to get authority to issue more
shares. This part of the programme will have to be
watched. One of the directors says: “I have had
numerous communications from shareholders suggest-
ing that, as in other institutions, the capital lost
in times of adversity should be replaced from profits
in times of prosperity, and I cannot regard them
views as either unfair or unreasonable.” This evi-
dently means that it is in the directors’ minds to get
authority to issue new shares, and then pay up those
shares out of reserves. In any circumstances this
species of bank-stock watering would be objection-
able ; in the special circumstances of this case it
would be worse than objectionable. The State left
£500,000 in the business, as mentioned just now,
on the security of pref. shares. It gets 5 p.c. cer-
tain ; thereafter it gets 1 p.c. extra for each 2 p.c.
extra paid on the ordinary shares up to 10 p.c. It
can’t get more than 10 p.c. Plainly, if the ordinary
shareholders get £lOO in bonus shares for every
£lOO they hold, the State will be in a much
worse position than it is now. Supnosing there is
about £BO,OOO available for distribution, that means
at present that the State gets 7 p.c. =
£35,000, while the ordinaries get 9 p.c. =
£45,000. But if the bonus shares were
issued the £BO,OOO or so would be cut up this way—-
State, 5& p.c. = £26,250; ordinaries, 5J p.c.
= £55,000 ; total, £81,250.' So the State would
lose nearly £9OOO, while the ordinaries got an extra
£9OOO. It isn’t a fair deal. Either the bank ought
to guarantee the State 10 p.c. —the maximum divi-
dend —or it should increase the State’s holding of
pref. shares in exactly the same ratio as it increases
the others. Parliament, before it passes the amend-
ing Bill, should see that the bank is bound to this.

This finely managed concern has had another thumo-
ing good year. But it has been too long at the
game to let the dividends take the bit in their teeth
and bolt. Australia, depending too much on wool
raising and wheat growing in unwatered districts of
very uncertain rainfall, intensifies its ups and downs
by its mad policy of borrowing wildly for State
works when things are naturally booming, and then
whipping the cat and practically shutting down on
development works when things are naturally slumpy.
The result shows up in the profit figures of nearly all
such cos. as this. The variations would be big in
any case on account of the co.’s pastoral interests and
the heavy drop in commission earnings on the hand-
ling of rural products in bad years ; but the varia-
tion in the earnings from the co.’s valuable agencies
must also be very great. Owing to the State Gov-
ernments’ common practice of making a boom more
gaudy and a slump more catastrophic, the spendings
of the Australian people vary excessively; and the
commission agent’s income varies even more because
he usually handles something which isn’t an absolute
necessity, and is, therefore, to a great extent done
without in bad times —motor-cars, for instance.
Further, Dalgetv’s profits show very big movements
because of the large amount of debenture money it
works on —money which calls for exactly the same
amount of interest whether the public is extravagant
and reckless, and can, therefore, be hit for big, quick
profits, or whether times are bad and profits are
small. At present, the co. has £2,266,135 borrowed
on irredeemable stock, mostly at 4 p.c., and another
£410,083 is held on terminable debentures. Who-
ever introduced this policy of working mainly on
fixed capital of this sort knew what he was about.
Australia is a great country, and its sheep and wheat
lands are unsurpassed in the world; only you mustn’t
bind it down to pay its loans on even these fruitful
lands this year or next. A drought may last two or
three years, and if the drought-stricken land be
thrown on the market, it is liable to fetch only a
quarter of its real value. The financial institution
which can hang on is the one which doesn’t show
appalling losses; and the financial institution which
can hang on is the one, naturally, whose own cre-
ditors can’t knock on the counter any day they please
and demand their money back. This is one reason
why Dalgety’s sailed on serenely during the terrible
years that followed the collapse of the boom of the
early ’9o’s—sailed on, kept its dividend going, and
didn’t have to ask anybody to take less than 20s. in
the £, its shareholders included. And its policy of
sitting. down tight on its dividends, even in rattling
good times, allows it to make fine provision against
the day when the country is hanging out signals of
distress. In the past seven years it has shown profits
aggregating £1,173,797, while only £601,042 has
been paid out in dividends. Thus over half a million
of visible, profits have been put by in the seven years.
Some of it, certainly, has been written off premises;
but that makes no difference. The effect is fust the
same as if the money was added to formal reserves.
This heaping-up of reserves is good for the creditor,
who gets so much more security for his money. It
is good for the shareholder, too. It not only further
secures him against the loss of his capital, but also
makes the maintenance of his fair dividend more
certain. And undoubtedly it attracts good custom.
The prudent man—and he is the good customer —is
becoming more and more convinced that the only
financial institution good enough for him is the one
which is strong enough to see him through a pinch.
Ihere are Australian banking 1 and mortgage concerns
which greedily lend so much during a boom that
when their customers want help verv badlv after-
wards, the applications have to be' turned down.
Those are the concerns which ought to be avoided.
Looking further into Dalgety’s details, these
figures are found:—

Advances, properties, etc. —the etc. includes merchan-
dise—-have moved up nearly half a million during the
year ; the money has come out of cash, deposits, etc.
This illustrates what was said just now. Down to the
end of June things looked very blue in most parts of
Australia, and hundreds of farmers of sorts had to
lean a bit on the men who were financing them.
Fortunately for Dalgety’s and others who were in a
position to come to their customers’ help, things
turned out all right.

Thus, in order to jump up the already obese divi-
dend another 5 p.c., the directors have to tap the
reserves; and in an insurance office this is almost
inexcusable. No doubt the management says, and
says truthfully, that in proportion to the risks, the
funds (capital and reserves) are exceedingly strong
- —stronger perhaps than it is necessary they should
be. But that isn’t a hint to the management to re-
duce the reserves ; it is a hint to increase the risks
by pushing out and taking more business. From the
following table it will be seen, among other things,
that there has been absolutely no expansion for years
past:—

There was no doubt a special reason for the shrink-
age shown in the past year’s accounts. The Derwent
and Tamar —the oldest fire-insurance concern in the
Commonwealth, by the way, though now partly held
“abroad”—has gone in pretty largely for marine
risks: and marine premiums have been so cut that
a lot of the business hasn’t been worth taking. Con-
sequently, this and several other Australian cos.
have been pulling out of that line, more or less. But
even so, there has been a very great deal more fire
business to be done. Millions of pounds have been
spent on new buildings, and many more millions
have been put inside those buildings. All that meant
more insurance business. Also there has been a slow,
but sure, awakening to the fact that Australian
offices have the first claim on Australian business.
In pushing that claim the Derwent and Tamar had
a special advantage, for it could show that in pro-
portion to its risks its funds were extraordinarily
strong—something like four times stronger than the
average of the leading British cos. That means, of
course, extraordinary security for the policyholder.
But, somehow, there has been little fight in the man-
agement. The shareholders have apparently been
content to sit down and draw their 15 p.c. dividend,
heedless of the fact that, if they pushed ahead, thev
might do still better; heedless also of the fact that,
iit. any time, there may be a war of rates, and that,
on its small turnover, the co. may find its profit re-
duced to practically nothing. Fortunately there are
signs of an awakening. A very nice old gentleman,
who has been 53 years in the co.’s service, has just
decided to “lay down the burdens of the general
manager’s office,” and the new management has
already got things ready to start in the accident and
live-stock business.

When this co. was formed it was provided that the
pref. shares, w)iich were offered to the public, should
take 10 p.c. p.a. for six years; after that, all shares
were to rank alike. The six-year period having now
expired, all shares are on the same footing. From
time to time, as the orofits have been sufficient to
pay ordinary shareholders a good deal more than they
actually got, sums were transferred to a deferred
dividend account. The money might have been paid
at once; but, as a matter of fact, the capital with
which the co. started was insufficient, and, in spite
of a new issue, the business needed every penny it
could hang on to. Things have been highly pros-
perous in this and other branches and side-lines of
the construction trade, and the financial position has
thus been strengthened ; consequently the last of this
“deferred” money is now paid out. Not that the
co. couldn’t still do with a good deal more capital;
for liabilities (all lumped together in the published
accounts) total £72,276. This is almost as much
as it has ever been: —

The long jump taken in the past six months is the
result chiefly of a big increase of stocks —£81,553
against £64,453 as at March, 1912. The capital is
£97,980; the reserves shown above amount to
£61,924. The latter would represent a very fine six
years’ accumulation if they were all genuine; but
there is some doubt about a part of the total. Re-
serve for depreciation is credited with £29,512, and
it seems highly nrobable that this is merely a set-
off against actual wear and tear, etc. The accounts
themselves show £3219 added to this reserve during
the half-year. If this is deducted from the profits
shown in the table £11,190 is left. If the true
profit is reduced to that figure it would still equal a
verv handsome 23 p.c. p.a. on the capital. But
that the recent results in the timber business will
last is highly improbable. As usual in times of
borrow and boom, not only has the demand been
abnormal, but prices have been abnormal too. Cer-
tainly costs have moved up a bit, but they tend
to move up still more, partly as the result of wages
board inquiries into this trade; and they are likely
to stay up even if the boom comes down wallop.

and began with £17,965 of its capital represented
by goodwill, which, of course, is a purely paper
asset: —-

Sept, 1912.. 3296.. 10 „,, 1750 228 11,192
There is still a good margin between profits and
dividends; and there needs to be, considering the
way the profits are slipping back. The flotation was
one of the bad ones of the last company-promoting
boom. The capital is £35,000, of which £17,950
represented the flimsy thing called goodwill, while, at
the outset, £3750 represented leaseholds —another
perishable asset. The balance was represented by
stock and plant and a trifle of freehold —apparently a
shed or something, valued in the first accounts at
£1575. The assets were thus of a particularly un-
attractive character. You could never go away for
a week and be certain they would be worth the old
figure or thereabouts when you came back. In those
circumstances, a high interest return in the shape of
profit was, of course, to be expected. You may be
content to make 7 p.c. or so on your capital when
half or more of it is represented by the gilt-edged
security of city land, but you will want a lot more
than that when you haven’t got a gilt-edged security
in your cupboard. In this case, there is certainly
nothing to complain of on the score of the interest
return; the net profit last year was at the rate of
18 p.c. on the capital. As for the cash position, it
has changed like this: —

There is nothing very joyful in that. Money has been
going out lately in plant and stock, and about £6OO
has been added to the freehold ( £3009) ;
but the unpleasant part of the business is
that, notwithstanding the big margin of pro-
fits, and notwithstanding the alleged large sums
put by towards reserves, and notwithstanding
that this money, and more, is being put into mostly
perishable assets, the profits shrink and shrink. Mean-
time, one has to take a lot of things on trust. For
instance, plant is now valued at £12,128, easily the
biggest item (goodwill excluded) ; and whether
enough is written off that to cover general deprecia-
tion it is impossible to say. The amount shown in
the table as written off is in reduction of the lease-
hold item, and is properlv not a writing-off at all: it
is really a trifle paid in lieu of rent.

During the past year Edward Rich, the founder of the
co., died in Europe, and the Board decided to risk
William McMillan’s bad financial luck (or whatever
it is), and made him chairman. The start isn’t en-
couraging; profits have slumped shockingly. But it
doesn’t follow that that is the result of the year's
work. In a concern of this kind you can’t always
sow and reap in the one year. What has actually
been the matter isn’t disclosed. The one item on
that side of the profit and loss account reads this
way: “Profit on trading and sundry profits after de-
ducting bad debts, depreciation, loss on shares in
other cos., wages, etc., £4941. In the previous
vear the remark this paper has put in italics wasn't
included; the total then was £17,010. From that
it would seem as though a loss on shares in other
cos. was responsible for the drop in net profits. But
apparently that isn’t so ; anyway, shares in other cos.
stand in the balance-sheet at the same £2906 as they
did 12 months ago, from which it might reasonably
be concluded that there had been no transactions what-
ever in shares. Or, if there were any transactions,
that the shares had been bought and sold during the
year; and that sort of trafficking wouldn’t be too
good a recommendation for a trading co. The only
explanation the directors offer is that various depart-
ments of the Sydney branch were disposed of during
the year —such large departments as grocery, crock-
ery, hardware, wines and spirits and tea—-“and,
although the transfer of the extensive stocks entailed
considerable expense and consequent loss, the sale,
considering its magnitude, was a most satisfactory
one.” Whether it was “most satisfactory” or not is
quite a matter of opinion. This paper regards it as
very unsatisfactory, not only because it resulted in a
loss, but because the co. has thus destroyed some of
the means by which large trading profits might have
been made in the future. It does not help matters
to say that the trading in these branches had not
been profitable. The co. had a chance, at any rate ;
and, anyway, failure isn’t anything to be proud of.
A management may show wisdom in shutting up
branches of its business; but it shows much better
qualities when it doesn’t have to shut them rip.
Probably it was the old trouble of cursed lack of
pence which was treading on this Board’s heels.
Twelve months ago liabilities ran into £77,812. The
total is now only £41,380. This has been brought
about, no doubt, by the sale of the stock above men-
tioned ; that item has been reduced from £140,741 to
£86,110 ; but, judging by a growth of nearly £40,000
in the bills receivable, the stock sold hasn’t all been
paid for yet. The capital is £198,037. The his-
tory of the co. is full of vicissitudes. The original
Rich started the business with a hawking van in the
old days of Bourke, when the western N.S.W. coun-
try was fat, and money was made easily. Then came
drought and trouble; book debts are nearly always
heavy when your customers get a harvest or a clip
only once a year, and the total swells threateningly
when they get only one in two or three years. That
happened to so many in this case that the co. had
to go for shelter under Dalgety’s wing, from which
it emerged only a year or two ago and set up a
completely separate establishment of its own again.
The fact that a heavy loss was evidently made in dis-
posing of some of the stock suggests that other values
may not be too reliable; and that, and the wretched
smallness of the reserves, accompanied by the severe
cut made in them to pay the current dividend, leaves
none too good a taste in the mouth. If a more-
than-sufficient profit was made in ordinary trading—•
a profit something like that of recent years—and if
the smashing reduction shown in the table was due to
quite extraordinary realisations, it would have been
far better to have shown it so in the accounts.

The co. makes its annual appropriations after the
March balance. The past half-year has been un-
usually profitable, in part the consequence of un-
usual prices and therefore unusual commissions, in
part of a wider appreciation of the fact that, given
good management, co-operative marketing must be
best in the long run. Starting from practically
nothing 121 years ago, the society has already an
annual turnover of over a million and a half —
£1,535,388 in the past year—and it is growing all
the time. Capital has unfortunately not grown with
the business; and though farmers and other co-
operators may take up shares at any time, the appli-
cations during the past 12 months brought in only
£3175, making the present capital £19,228. For-
tunately the co. works on either a cash or a fort-
nightly credit basis ; but even so, there was £73,462
on the books at the end of the half-year. And from
time to time the co. has to make big consignments
to Europe, in respect of which it must take some
risk. Managed as it has been hitherto, and hit by no
disaster, the co. could pull through on its present
funds; but they are not enough to cover contin-
gencies, and the people who are saving tens of thou-
sands a year in middlemen’s profits ought for their
own safety to invest a little of it with this co. —and
get a steady 6 p.c. for it. Some of them argue, of
course, that they can’t see the advantage—they can
do almost as well, and now and again better, by
dealing with the Private Enterprise middleman and
produce gambler. But if this and other mutual
societies were knocked out, what then?

Harden gold mine (N.S.W.) has been
shut down finally, and the plant will, it is understood,
be auctioned at an early date. As a last resort, the
diamond drill was called in, but only negative results
were got. From the upper levels the co. won fair
divs. ; but, as at so many other N. S. Wales gold
mines, disappointment came at about 600 ft., and
despair arrived a couple of hundred feet later.

Copper men will be interested in the
restarting of Lloyd’s mine at Burraga (N.S.W.), for it
has the deepest copper workings in the State (2283 ft.).
Previous to suspending smelting (May 1907) it was
turning out metal at the rate of over 1000 tons a
year. The production for three years to the
end of 1907 was 3304 tons copper, of a gross value
(including precious metals) of £275,031. The grade
was between 2 p.c. and 3 p.c., the last return being
36,102 tons of ore for 960 tons metal (=2.6 p.c.).
Reserves were estimated at no more than 120,000
tons, so the mine can do with energetic develop-
ment. One of Lloyds’ misfortunes is that it is iso-
lated from railway communication, and consequently
has to rely on firing its reverberatory furnaces with
wood fuel; and such large quantities are required
that a supply of timber is almost as important as a
mine of ore. W. H. Corbould managed it in former
days, and his later success at Mount Elliott is pretty
good proof that it wasn’t for lack of good and
energetic direction that it had to shut down in the
end. Nowadays J. D. Armstrong is in charge; and
the two have many qualities in common.
Tbe next Australian mining engineer to
trip to the Malay Peninsula to look at tin mines and
plants will be A. H. P. Moline, who has brought the
Y Waterholes to a front place among the Common-
wealth’s sluicing ventures. Moline leaves for Singa-
pore next month on a brief inspection visit.

A great mistake, when erecting new works oi re

building and installing machinery ere looking round
for means of transport of the raw material, half-
manufactured and finished goods. Messrs. Adolf

they have supplied, and which show the solution of
the transport question and the advantages of em-
ploying such appliances. W. and J. Lempriere,

tives, and would be pleased to hear from those in-
terested. A specially trained engineer is retained to

just as interesting to know. A fair amount of tin
has been available to sweeten up returns and keep
down calls. Diamonds have been discovered plenti-
fully in N.S.W., the number running into thousands
but reliable records have not been kept. Australian
diamonds are noted for their hardness, and this and
their smallness have kept the price down. But their
brilliance is a compensating factor. An amalgama-
tion of Mount Ross with the Copeton syndicate has
been effected. There is a good deal of activity in
the district in connection with options to foreign
capital, mostly Dutch. Big things” are expected
from what is declared to be the pipe formation that
is comparable to the yellow and blue ground of
S’Africa, from which the bulk of the world’s dia-
monds is derived. It is a curious fact that alluvial
diamonds usually bring higher prices than those from
the pipes, the Vaal River stones being able to
command over £4 per carat, as against 48s 6d
from the Kimberley mine and 30s. from the Premier'
This fact may have an important bearing on develop-
ments at the alleged pipe formation here. Still
large diamonds and higher prices are “confidently
expected.”

Some rude things were said in London by
the shareholders of the Great Lucknow Consols, whose
mine is outside Orange (N.S.W.). The occasion was
a meeting to confirm a scheme of reconstruction. The
past history was admitted to have been rotten, but
the directors persuaded the shareholders that it was
not their fault —as if it ever was. The directors were
re-elected, the idea apparently being that no one else
could unravel the tangle. The back accounts were
buried without dissection. Work is now proceeding
at the mine, where a vertical shaft is being sunk
140 ft. due east of the underlay shaft. The reef is
expected to be cut at 325 ft. vertical, and levels will
be opened at 200 ft. and 300 ft., the former being at
the bottom of the present deepest workings. The
director in charge at the mine declares that the
southern portion of the lease more than impresses
him, as he sees a kindly appearance about the quartz.
It will be still nicer if he sees the same about the
shareholders when next they meet.
* * * *
The Grafton (N.S.W.) has so far been
content to treat only its better class ore, averaging
about 8 or 9 p.c. copper, with results that are ex-
pressed in the dividend list: but it has now decided
that it is time to consider the mining and treatment
of the lower-grade stuff, of which there is said to be
a plentiful supply. To push along with mine devel-
opment, which is backward, and to cheapen costs,
rock drills are now being introduced. It is only a
question of time when shaft sinking will be needed,
as the bottom adit opens near the gully bed. Some
fair-sized reserves are demanded by the four rever-
beratory furnaces, which chew up 900 tons of ore per
month, producing on an average 110 tons of 60 p.c.
matte.
Gold production showed a further falling
off in the West during 1912. Kalgoorlie, as usual,
was responsible for most of the output, and unless an
unexpected earthquake interferes with its workings
or its plants, it is certain to do so for a good
many years to come. Some of the mines there still
have a long life ahead of them, but what with reduced
grade, stationary or increased costs, and diminished
returns, the future promises to be a good deal less
profitable than the past. As far as mining on a big
scale is concerned, some must go to the wall very
soon. Of the other centres Meekatharra has done the
best, but with the starting up of a number of plants
Yilgarn is expected to make a forward move during
the coming year. Depth, however, may settle the
pretensions of this field, although the ore now being
dug out of the Bullfinch northern series looks promis-
ing. The best mines on the outback fields are still
the Sons of Gwalia (Leonora), Great Fingall (Day
Dawn) and the Paddy’s Flat group (Meekatharra) ;
and among the newcomers the Youanmi and Associ-
ated Northern Co.’s Victorious (Ora Banda). As re-
gards other minerals the production of lead was the
highest to date, while that of tin also showed up
well. The output of copner showed a big drop, and
in a lesser degree so did that of silver. Increased
production at Whim Creek and returns from other
sources are expected to swell the copper output in
1913. Collie coal industry steadily advanced, and the
year’s output was a record. There were two rushes,
one at Kurnalpi and the other at Binti Binti : but
excenting the rich specimens got at Kurnalpi, neither
produced much to write home about.

On July 3] Kaleurli (W.A.) had the fol-
lowing cash assets: Investments (at cost) £23,122,
sundry deposits £l6lB, gold in transit (since rea-
lised) £15,352, money £36,771; total, £76,863.
Its liabilities were—Sundry creditors £24,730, and
unclaimed dividends £1939; total, £26,669. But
stores ( £8639) and amounts owed by sundry debtors
are a set-off against this liability to the extent
of about one-third. Since July a 4s. dividend, ab-
sorbing with taxes £25,200, has been distributed,
and a similar one was payable on January 7. Profits
have, of course, been earned in the interim, but not
sufficient to cover these payments.
A net profit of £8144 was earned by the
Burbanks Main Lode (W.A.) for the past financial
year, and after allowing for a 12i p.c. dividend and
the “additional remuneration” payable to directors
under the articles, there remains a balance of £3198,
which increases the total undivided profit to £12,375.
Ore reserves are estimated at 34,000 tons, as against
27,000 tons at the end of the previous year. The
Board asserts that when the new power and other
plant is in operation, important reductions in costs
may be looked for, and the reserves of payable ore
will thereby be increased.
Altogether 10,003 tons of tributors’ ore
were treated by North Kalgurli (W.A.) during the
year ended August 31, for a recovery of £27,354.
Other receipts made a total revenue of £27,761.
Expenditure in Australia and London, including
tributors’ whack, totalled £25,481, leaving a gross
working profit of £2279. This has been dealt with hv
writing off £1154 for depreciation, allocating £5O
for income tax, and carrying £1074 forward. At
the meeting in London on December 5, it was de-
cided to reconstitute the co. with a nominal capital
of £35,000, divided into 350,000 2s. shares. Of
the new shares 301,411 will be issued as fully-paid
to present shareholders on share for share basis,
leaving 48,589 in reserve. It is expected that this
change of capital will be followed by microscopic
dividends.

Gwalia Consolidated (W.A.) admits a

tom. Ingliston Consols is getting ready to drive

important, as the country is comoosed of schist
similar to that in the older mines.

At Yilgarn (W.A.) Marvel Loch mill is

the co.’s own ore will probably be resumed in a

are being made to the plant. Breakdowns, etc.,
have unfavorably affected Mountain Queen’s profits
of late, but the Board’s expectations of £2OOO a
month is said to be on the verge of realisation.

After writing off the whole cost of de-
velopment, depreciation and income tax, amounting
in all to nearly £46,000, Yuanmi’s accounts for the
14 months ended June 30, show the slender credit
balance of £853. Referring to the co.’s two mines,
the report, issued in London, states that the Oroya-
Black Range working costs, exclusive of development,
averaged 225. 6d., or 2s. Bd. per ton less than in the
previous 12 months. At Yuanmi the average expen-
diture was about 15s. The difference in the costs of
the two mines is explained by the higher mining ex-
penses on the Oroya-Black Range, due to the flatness
of the reef and heavy cost of timbering. Combined
ore reserves are estimated at 147,973 tons, of a gross
value of £302,608. The consulting engineers re-
mark that the most prominent feature of recent work
in the Yuanmi mine is that, so far as the two
deepest levels have progressed, they seem to indicate
that the shoots of payable ore are shorter and more
variable in value; but (the engineers go on to re-
mark) the property is a large one, and the ultimate
future of it can only be determined by further de-
velopment. a Is. dividend ( £17,500) was paid on
December 16.

Apparently under the influence of the
spirit of optimism, Princess Royal (W.A.) reports
that the prospect of finding something as a result of
the State-aided boring now in progress, is “re-
assuring.” Norseman, where the co.’s show is situ-
ated, has never yet shown up very well at death, and
if anything of permanent value is struck in the Prin-
cess Royal it will agreeably surprise a lot of people.
The Melbourne co. which got hold of the
old Augusta at Laverton some months ago, is making
ready to crush. But the shoot is short, and trouble
isn’t far off.

But, in spite of the increased profit, only the old
quarterly Is. ( £lOO,OOO per half-year) has been
paid. Of the balance, £lOO,OOO goes to a re-build-
ing fund. This is the result of the volcano which
became active shortly after Walter Russell Hall’s
death. The whole thing is being turned upside down
and inside out. Captain Richard having retired from
the too-big job of general manager and metallurgist,
Magnus, formerly of the Kembla (N.S.W.) electro-
lytic works, was appointed. He is an American cop-
per man with a big reputation; curiously enough it
was Richard who chose him for the Kembla job
when Mount Morgan had decided to put money into
a refinery. In consultation with Sticht, of Mount
Lyell, he decided that the present smelting plant
won’t do for pyritic smelting. Hence £lOO,OOO is
taken from the present profits and dropped into a re-
placement fund. Magnus tries to console share-
holders with the remark that they would sooner or
later have to build other and bigger plant, anyway,
as the existing plant couldn’t see the present ore re-
serves through. Meantime the existing plant is
being adjusted. Mechanically operated slag bowls
are going in, and the converters and the means for
handling the matte are having attention. The man-
ager says that at the start of the half-year they were
using 1.22 tons of Many Peaks pyritic flux (1.64 p.c.
copper) to every ton of silica in the Mount Morgan
ore: at the end the proportion was 0.577 to 1.
“This,” says the manager, “is due to better furnace
work and better experience in the handling of these
ores.” Such a result is all the more creditable be-
cause the mundic works have been shut down, and
the smelter has been handling the ore formerly
treated in these works—ore which, of course, calls
for more flux than the mine’s copper ore. As to
financial results, the new order cannot be judged until
it has got the plant it says is necessary ; and a con-
sideration of costs, etc., is of little value at the
moment. High metal values are giving the co. a
fine lift; they alone, indeed, are enabling the eo. to
carry out its big construction and reconstruction
campaign, involving a total expenditure of nearly
4200,000, without passing or even reducing the divi-
dend. A further result of the big price of copper
is the treatment of considerable quantities of ore not
hitherto included with the reserves. Magnus produces
this new table:—

Gympie mines ended the year with a
dreary tale of poverty. One small Christmas dividend
was paid—a paltry 2d. =£Boo. This would not be
so bad if the call list spoke up a little, but it doesn’t.
The Government is doing its best by granting £ for
£ subsidies ; but the money is still going, so far, to
the old southern portion of the field. Government
geologists have often spoken of the Two-mile (north)
end as being practically virgin and possessing geo-
logical conditions similar to the rest of the field ; so
a little spent there might go a long way, more espe-
cially as the one bright speck on the present mining
horizon is a crushing of 34 tons for 80oz. gold from
the Great Northern, working in the Two-mile area.
This gold comes from a lower bed of slate, new to
this company. Driving on the reef in the slate has
just been started. With a good, strong reef and
coarse gold, this mine should be heard more of
directly. Scottish Gympie is to increase its crush-
ing capacity, feeding with low-grade stuff from the
Inglewood reef. The No. 2 South Great Eastern is
now working on that formation, but results are so
far a disappointment.

Ore, Stored matte, Copper,
tons. tons. tons.
October .. 4482 830 725
November .. 4415 558 650
December . . 3337 441
There was no fall in the grade of ore treated in
December, for the average extraction was 12.2 p.c.
The reduced quantity of copper obtained was due to
the short run (21 days), and the fact that the stack
of matte that had boomed the previous returns had
been used up. The chairman of directors estimates
that, as a regular thing, the extraction will aver-
age 10 p.c. If even 10 p.c. can be kept up for the
next four years, Hampden will be lucky; anyway,
the quality of much of the quarter million tons of
ore said to be proved must be largely a guess.
* * * *
From Rossville (N.Q.) : I told The
Bulletin a couple of months ago that mining en-
gineer T. W. Horton (Horton and Freeman) was in
the Far North of Queensland running an eye over tin-
mining shows, in the joint interests of his own and
some Melbourne people, represented by J. L. Whar-
ton. He had a look at various sluicing propositions,
and just before he had to hurry south to catch a
boat for Singapore, he decided to have another look
at a property known as the Sandhills, on Mount Hart-
ley. How on earth this fair-sized hill of sand came
on these scrub-clad mountains no one knows for cer-
tain. Four men have been holding the ground for
about two years, and one of them has spent a con-
siderable amount of money on the property. Horton
got an option, and thought he had a very cheap thing
for £2OOO. A small deposit was paid. Then Horton
had a look at the country around the Sandhills, as
the Sandhills by itself was not big enough to justify
the construction of plant, etc. Satisfied with pro-
spects, which came from 42 “scout” bore-holes and
a few shafts, Horton left for the Straits Settlements.
Then Francis, of the Annan River Co., acting on
Wharton’s behalf, sent up a man to carry the tests
farther, preparatory to handing over the purchase
money. This cautious proceeding was most unfortu-
nate for somebody, as presently Francis’s man came
down from Mount Hartley with the news that the
Sandhills had been salted. There were, as said just
now, 42 boreholes, and they averaged from 71b. to
101 b. of tin to the yard—very rich prospects. As
far as the borings went down, some of them well over
40ft., the rich prospects kept on. But now not a
color of tin can be found an inch from any of the
boreholes or the shafts. Francis cleared into Cook-
town, declared the deal off until an inquiry was held,
and stopped a couple of the interested parties from
going away for a holiday by boat. Yet it looks next
to impossible to prove anything against anybody in
connection with the salting. It is almost certain
that the majority of the Sandhill men had nothing to do
with it. One little mistake the salter made, and
that little error started Francis’s suspicions. Instead
of being Sandhill tin that came from the borings, it
was tin from some other ground, and water-worn tin
at that. Francis remarked that it was peculiar for
water-worn tin to be 40ft. under the ground. So
there was some more nosing around, and the beauti-
ful bubble was burst. Horton, who naturally, on
his preliminary work, believed that he had got hold
of something extra-good, if not extra-big, has been
informed bv wire of the fraud. It will puzzle him
to know how the thing was done. It is puzzling most
of Rossville. There is no doubt in the world that
someone should go to gaol over it. But in such
cases the Government somehow will never take action,
and the men who have just escaped being taken
down say that they can’t afford to throw good money
after bad. It is all most unsatisfactory.

New Ravenswood (Q.) is owned mostly
by John Bull, who has received £131,922 in divi-
dends. And the outlook is good, for ore reserves
have lately increased, and the purchase of the
London North and London P.C. adds very consider-
ably to the tonnage of crushing stuff. For the co.’s
12 months to the end of June, 18,855 tons were
crushed for a total return of £60,014. The net
profit was £10,802, out of which £7465 was paid
in dividends on a capital of £39,815. This co. was
formed in 1899, so its total of £131,922 spells an
average dividend of £lO,OOO a year. The reserves
are calculated at 28,222 tons. #
The O.K. mine (N.Q.) is being prospected
with the diamond drill, and sinking is going on at
the North O.K. shaft in the hope of developing
another shoot of copper. Five horizontal bore-holes
at the 300 ft. level don’t encourage the idea that the
hard country will carry another bonanza, so the
rest of the boring is to be . done within the zone of
secondary enrichment, which means handy to where
the rich pockets were discovered in the shallows.
The best ore came from above the 155 ft. level ;
this contributed practically all the £93,000 that
was paid in dividends. #
Last half-year Kulamadau (Woodlark
Island, Papua) crushed 7517 tons for an average ex-
traction, including the cvaniding of tailings, of £ 1 ss.
44d. per ton. Costs took £1 2s. 74d. (mining, 14s.
sd. ; milling, ss. 4.7 d. ; cyaniding, 2s. 9.8 d.). Dur-
ing the half-year two 2d. calls realised £l5OO, and
it seems probable that more money will be required,
for the directors, having got the mill in order, in-
tend to do a good deal of development and open up
No. 5 level, which, in the rise 100 ft. south of the
crosscut, showed a big lode worth 23dwt. per ton.
Still, the crushings taken from the stopes north and
south of the rise have not given anything like that
return, and the fact that the lode is 16ft. wide for a
distance of 90ft. isn’t a convincing proof of its
value. The directors appear to hope for good devel-
opments at the north end of No. 5 level. The latest
return shows a slight improvement—l4B7 tons were
crushed and 1200 tons cyanided tor £2659.
McLeish’s show, the Woodlark King, crushed 62 tons
for 5320 z., in addition to which 150 tons of tailings
were treated for £554. A defective boiler put the
brake on the tonnage.
Tongkah Harbor averaged slightly under
lib. of tin oxide per cubic yard in December;
314,300 cubic yards were dredged for 133 tons 17
cwt. (299,8641 b.) of oxide. Practically 2345 cubic
yards had to be turned over to produce a ton of
oxide; yet, as working costs don’t exceed 4d. per
cubic yard, the cost of producing a ton of oxide is
considerably below £4O. To the five dredges now
in commission another is to be added to reach a
depth of 60ft. ; and that is a hint that conditions
will be less easy than they have been.

WOMAN'S
LETTER
Sydney, January 6, 1913.
My Dear Arini. —
Lady Iving-Hall’s last tea-party at Admi-
ralty House —till her next one in April or
thereabouts —was successfully stage-managed
by Flag-Lieut. Seton. He hovered near the
rims of various large round tables, strenu-
ous in the path of duty which leads to the
distribution of bun and biscuit. The Ad-
miralty lady found rest for the soles of her
slippers at odd intervals, but mostly kept on
moving in search of stragglers, rounding
them up with hospitable intent in a gown
that was a diaphanous mixture of a deep
rose sunset and a purple mist. It was
the Admiral’s day “at home” as well, so he
let himself go re our Navy amongst 50 of
our best bonnets. His naval Ex. showed
such a firm belief in Australia that some of
the Little Australians were obviously
stunned to silence.
Here are some “Imperial” feathers of a
color not recognised by the Jingo tribe. They
were plucked from the Admiral’s remarks
at the party. “Englishmen don’t understand
the Australian people till they come and live
out here....No man should be Secretary of
State for the Colonies till he has spent a
considerable time in this magnificent coun-
try.... Those who oppose an Australian
navy interlocked with the British navy are
short-sighted. The idea has the national
sentiment of this country behind it, and it’s
the only statesmanlike scheme possible. In
Senator Pearce the Commonwealth has a
statesman. Its Prime Minister Fisher is
another very able man. He spent a few
days with us, and we greatly enjoyed his
society.”
The fashionable hat could hardly restrain
its emotion—the Hat being chiefly Tory; —
and the owner may have kicked herself vio-
lently on the shins to make sure that she
wasn’t merely dreaming dreams of a British
Admiral flinging posies to a Labor Govern-
ment. Alas! it was real. The potentate
was at home for fun, and distinctly enjoyed
the stunned appearance of our most Expen-
sive Suburbs. His Naval Ex. recently told
Auckland (M.L.) his mind on the same sub-
ject, and he threatens to be as plain-spoken
when he meets the crusty lords of the Ad-
miralty later in the year.
The Admirable King-Hall has the
same hearty no-nonsense manner as ex-
Governor Eawson. Very few of the younger
men in the navy, judging by some of the
samples we see in local “society,” have much
in common with the simple, unaffected old
sea-dogs of the Rawson and King-Hall type.
The latter loves his work on this.station, and
has bearded the Australian Jingo in his
sheep-pen more than once on the question of
giving substantial support to a Common-
wealth Navy League.
The Highland Society’s Hogmanay, in the
Town Hall, roused the Scottish boot to a
fine frenzy of applause, especially when
John Lemmone served up the national airs
on his flute. The pipes of Pan Mac Wha-
tever also lent their bleat to help the plaidies
over the New-Year stile.
The ancient Exhibition Building, in
Prince Alfred Park, probably blushed be-
hind its cobwebs to find itself recently
turned into a concert hall. It is accus-
tomed these days to serve the more, or less
useful purpose of a roller-skating rink. It
once had a humble billet in the fowl busi-
ness, and listened unprotestingly while the
barn-door rooster cx-owed down Governors’
speeches at annual poultry shows. Indeed,
it has been, in its day, a kind of lost property
office for nearly every show the ingenuity of
man could devise, from educated fleas to
human monstrosities.
In this venerable bairn the Highland So-
ciety had its second helping of bagpipes on
New Year’s Night, when about 3000 Scots
were comfortably accommodated. The
acoustics had been severely dealt with before-
hand by means of a mammoth sounding-
board. The old building was such a success
as a concert hall that the canny Scot is liable
to be after it for New Year dates every time.
The municipal maw has opened so wide of
late for special holiday rent of the Town
Hall that the average concert manager can
only retire to his till and count his losses
after the event.
Gilbert Parker’s version of “Faust,” at
the Theatre Royal, gives the Devil plenty
of smart repartee. Mephistopheles (Robert-
shaw) wears, with his red tights and
doublet, a long fierce feather on his head.
It is no wider than a quill, and almost as
stiff as an ostrich’s leg, though it gives a
kick sometimes to punctuate a particu-
larly wicked remark. On Saturday night
the theatre was packed to the roof, and a
holiday audience drank in ‘the steam and
sulphur of Mephisto’s underground residen-
tial cave, with starting eyes. Small red
devils armed with three-pronged forks, and
a ballet of ladies in bare arms and legs
and seaweed-green drapery, tore madly
round the Satanic warming pan. I suppose
the ladies were hussies, for they were all
good-looking.
Beatrice Terry is the antithesis of the
average stout, elderly lady who sings the
part of Marguerite in the “Faust” opera.
She is youthful, tall and rather lean, grows
her own corn-colored hair, and has blue eyes
and a thin, high-pitched speaking voice. She
is not like her famous Auntie Ellen, except
in a trick of turning her side face
and looking over one shoulder; for
Ellen, even 10 years ago, was a witch with a
voice of velvet and cream. In the long ago,
novelist Charles Reade said he loved her,
though she had such a way with her that
he suspected she was a minx, or could be if
she liked.
You can read the most striking fashion
note of the moment in the small percentage
of bare feminine backs in the stalls of Syd-
ney theatres. Country backs, mostly. The
holiday visitor is prone to show only a very
small V of healthy tanned flesh to the casual
gaze.
An innocent-looking beast with the mild
name of Angelique snatched Tattersall’s Cup
money from two favorites on New Year’s
Day. A fairly inexperienced bettor, who
won £5OO at 20 to 1, entertained a party of
friends with fizz and reminiscences after the
event. He told the company that he had
refused the entreaties of the bookie to put
more money on Angelique, being unaware
that a bookmaker is occasionally a fairy god-
father heavily disguised.
The Charles Mackellars are just back
from Europe, having left poetic daughter
Dorothea on the other side of the globe. Dr.
Mackellar, M.L.C., seems to have put in
almost as strenuous a time as the lady who
lately recorded to the London bench that she
had been thrown downstairs 14 times in one
day by her lawful husband, and had broken
three teeth and a haircomb in the process.
The president of the State Children’s Relief
Board has broken nothing—he has more than
kept even his promises to the State Govern-
ment. In his pursuit of information in
Europe he probed the methods of the Neme-
sis that dogs the steps of Delinquent Chil-
dren, he lent his ear to the deliberations of
a Moral Education Congress at the Hague,
he hurried into the discourse of Interna-
tional Eugenics in London, and he tapped
the Maria Montessori methods in Rome.
Half a dozen other sprints for knowledge
also showed his energy and enthusiasm.
Concerning the Montessori system of edu-
cation, a very able woman-teacher in the
N.S.W. Public Instruction Department
tells me this :
We are already adopting the Italian methods for
kindergarten work, without actually dropping the
Froebel system. In the end we shall probably weave
the two together, for the Montessori method has
weak places. It does not in some respects grip our
volatile, joyous Australian child, who loves play, as
firmly as the Froebel circle games. Dr. Montessori
would put away fairy tales which stimulate the
juvenile imagination, and she does not believe in
games. Here I cordially disagree with her,
and I have been teaching children for —well,
many years. In reading, writing and arithmetic,
however, the Montessori method is unrivalled. The
results will be a remarkable upheaval in our older
system, which made the teacher too dominant, and
the child unresponsive and reluctant to digest dry
facts.
Maria Montessori, being a woman, grap-
pled with the minor domestic tragedy of a
small child imploring its adult guardians, or
its eldest sister, or Mary Jane, to button it
up in the morning. A youngster with all its
strings undone, and its button-holes gaping,
and its undergarments falling on its socks,
is evidently peculiar to no country. The
Italian infant, clamoring for help at day-
break, must have caught the Montessori eye.
Hence, in the lessons, are “objects” (I think
this is the term) which have to be tied,
hooked and buttoned. The child soon learns
to dress itself, and its uprising does not split
the welkin with cries for help.
If Dr. Maria will go a step further, she
will be hailed as a benefactress by her sex,
and other women’s husbands will rise up and
call her blessed. An automatic hook-
fastener, that will enable Woman to drag
her clothes together over her spinal column,
since no self-respecting dressmaker will
allow her to hook herself up in front, is the
invention the world is waiting for. “Thank
Heaven, I have a husband!” said a dressy
dame to a pair of mere spinsters at a well-
known tourist resort. “You’ve no idea what
useful creatures men are—if they’re properly
trained.”
Sydney’s 1913 Gaud Mayor Cocks put'on
his furs and gold chain and other civic up-
holstery the other day, for the first time, and
sat down firmly in front of the camera. Now
the female end of the community is waiting
to unload its personal opinion of the new
Mayoress who never has any trouble with
her handmaidens.
Astronomer Mary Proctor galloped
through this town after her return from
M.L. She left here with various other
learned souls and bodies by Sunday’s ex-
press, and hopes to welter in the light of
more information in Melbourne. The Aus-
tralasian Association for the Advancement
of Science is the heavyweight fixture that
attracts her. Later, she trains to Adelaide
in time to fall into her bunk on the Orontes.
In India her camp will be on the roof of
things, about 7000 ft. above the torrid plains.
She stays with Astronomer Evershed and his
wife at the Kodai Kanal Observatory in
Southern India. Still pursuing “other
worlds than ours,” little Miss Proctor means
to rush off to Egypt and stare the sun-
harnessing machine full in the face. This
modern magic collects the sun’s rays and
uses their heat to generate the steam in an
irrigating plant. Think of old Cairo treat-
ing the sun god as an ordinary beast of
burden!
In M.L. the Mary Proctor lectures were
not without diversions. One of the larger
cities supplied an intoxicated lady (lucky
this didn’t happen in the prohibition parts)
who remained fairly quiet in a front seat
till the lecturer began to round up to her
planets. Then she lurched forward and
said in stormy tones: “Don’t tell us. ’bout
stars —tell us ’bout hats!” Just there the
usher took a hand.
The task of warming up the lantern
slides before the Wellington lecture was en-
trusted to a conscientious man in the hotel
kitchen. “I didn’t like to see after it my-
self, because I thought I might be in the
way, so I explained that lantern slides must
be heated to a certain temperature,” says
Mary Proctor. “He promised to see that
my directions were carried out. As soon as
the first slide was produced at the lecture, I
knew the pictures were done for. There
were new milky ways everywhere. Next
day I began by reproaching my helper. ‘‘But
I did just what you told me —warmed up
those slides till they were so hot I had to
take ’em off.’ ‘Off what?’ I gasped. ‘Off
the steam boiler, Miss, I had ’em for two
hours on top of it!’ Every lecturer,” con-
tinued the star-talker, “will realise what
steamed slides are like —moisture is the very
thing we have to guard against. Steamed
stars are not a spectacular success.”
Maoriland is to be represented at the
Science Congress by some of its bright
brains. Amongst them will be Professor H.
B. Kirk, who warms the chair of Biology in
the Victoria College (Wellington) ; Pro-
fessor H. B. Laby, who performs a similar
distinguished kindness to the chair of
Physics in the same institution; and Augus-
tus Hamilton, Director of the Colonial
Museum. The last-named succeeded the bril-
liant James Hector, and knows more about
Maori art, for instance, than half the
tohungas in the country. But the “star”
Maorilander (although he won’t offi-
cially represent the country) will be
Professor Ernest Rutherford, the famous
physicist. He is a native-born, who
attained prominence some years ago
by research in radio-activity. His tal-
ents were too extensive for Maoriland, but
just what an older, larger world was hanker-
ing for ; so some years ago he moved on, and
this trio to the Antipodes is merely of the
flying variety.
Baronet Mackenzie Mackenzie has been
telling a theatrical magazine a plain tale of
the dreariness of being a baronet fighting
for a crust. As a super he has seen service
on the Australian stage, and meekly re-
marks : “I do not think I am adapted co
make a living in any other sphere.” It is
probably true. When the drab necessity of
actually working for his bread crosses the
track of an impecunious baronet, he appears
to be rather worse off than the average other
unskilled laborer.
Dame Fysh, wife of Philip Oakley Fysh,
of Tasmania, passed out on December 27, in
Hobart. She was the eldest daughter of
William Willis, a manufacturer of Luton,
England, and married Philip in 1856. Three
years later they landed in the Strawberry
Isle. The husband plunged into a success-
ful commercial career, and afterwards got
first into local and then into Federal poli-
tics, and snared a knighthood. Mrs. Fysh
had an unusual record in these gad-about
days, having lived in Hobart for half a cen-
tury. She entertained largely, was an excel-
lent cook, and a genial hostess, and called
her house Liberty Hall. The widower, who
owned one of the two most beautiful
beards in the Convention which framed a
Constitution for the Commonwealth, is climb-
ing up to his 78th birthday.
Cattle-man Kidman’s daughter Gertrude
is going to make a love-match with the man
of her heart on January 25. He is a lieu-
tenant on the Warrego, and papa Kidman
did not smile on the affair till recently. Now
he relents, and Mr. Nelson Clover will get
an uncommonly Nice Girl. After the honey-
moon, the Clover-blossom bride will travel
round to meet him at the various ports, for
the Warrego has a roving commission.
Mrs. F. B. Shaw, who was Miss Dolly
O’Donnell a few weeks ago, took a sister
with her to Siam. This was the bridegroom’s
idea, and was based on his knowledge of the
weird etiquette of that tropic settlement.
There the newly-married bride has to break
the social ice by calling instead of being
called on. If the ’groom’s business takes
him much away from home, a nervous bride
has to set forth alone to meet the lynx-eyed
criticism of the resident gentry. Hence a
sister to serve as a breakwater is a frequent
Anglo-Siamese habit.
The orange-blossoming of Miss Grace
Acheson to Surgeon Robinson, of the Sea-
lark, occurred on December 31, amidst a pro-
fuse display of frock and frill. A goodly
share of the frill was supplied by the male
persuasion, for the Navy turns out in its
best to see a brother officer tramp to the
altar. The bride is the only chick of Mrs.
Acheson, of Wollerang, Darling Point, a
member of the well-known Plunkett family.
Grandpa Plunkett was one of the early legal
pillars of this State as Under-Secretary for
Justice. Money floats round the family, and
Mrs. Grace Robinson is likely to inherit a
fat slice of this world’s goods.
The Saturday afternoon “at home” is
creeping into fashion again. One or two
professional musicians are commissioned to
assist the conversation with crashing chords,
and a vocalist is thrown in to add to the
harmony. The musical Milford family,
whose extensive house stares out across
Manly’s water-front, were “at home” to
their' friends last Saturday. The musical
items were a mile or so ahead of those on
the average tea-party programme. Miss
Alice May Cadogan, who is followed through
life by learned letters, was the star pianist.
She’s a pupil of the famous Teichmiiller, of
Leipsic Conservatorium. Reginald Gooud,
of the deep, deep voice, boomed his artistic
way through solos from “The Messiah” and
other classics. And an amateur or two took
part in the tumult of glad noises.
The feminine brain is said to be growing
larger. I don’t think, however, that it is
likely to outgrow a desire to wear French
millinery. Noted the brainy Dr. Marion
Thornett the other day in a hat of the elu-
sive model style, with sweeping black feath-
ers that tickled one ear, and tricky black
velvet strings floating around. The same
lady was garbed in something very up-to-
date in charmeuse, and was finished off with
high-heeled shoes. The latter looked friv-
olous enough to be at least Louis XIV., if
not more.
According to a London correspondent, the
poulterer is beginning to do a thriving trade
in the once-despised feathers of the barn-
door bird. Dyed and put together with cun-
ning hand, the tail of a Sunday dinner often
waves on the head of ' Fashion. Even
chicken’s plumage is pressed into the ser-
vice, and the humble duck contributes her
bill and head to an orgy of winged millin-
ery. 1912 is said to have held a world’s
record for feathered hats. If 1913 keeps up
the terrific strain, the feather duster will
cease to exist except as a luxury in the
homes of millionaires.
Australians abroad gather round their
native Christmas bush in spirit, per medium
of the useful postcard. Leslie Harbutt, the
plump and comely Sydney violinist, is now
in Bohemia —an address with a joyous
flavor in it. She sent a Sydney friend a
cheery greeting for the New Year.
Lilian Delany, daughter of the late John
Delany, one of our finest composers and the
great choir-master at St. Mary’s Cathedral
a few years ago, is now studying the piano
in foreign parts. She writes from Vienna.
The last mail brought news of violinist
Leila Waddell, the Bathurst girl who went
to England about three years ago. Leila is
still fiddling with success on the other side.
Kate Rooney has sent her latest photo
this way. The Sydney contralto has
achieved a pleasing plumpness, and looks as
if the world went very well with her.
Organist Lilian Frost, writing to a friend
here, said her home-coming was shadowed
by her father’s death in Launceston. Instead
of coming direct to Sydney, she paused for
Christmas at the home-nest in Tasmania.
During her stay in England, Miss Frost was
admitted to the inner circle of “swell”
organs in England, and given the freedom
of their stops.
Hilda Aiken, who tripped off to Van-
couver with Eva Mylott, sends a line from
Calgary, one of Canada’s youngest cities, so
new that its first lick of paint is only just
dry. It leapt into fame as the town of 12,000
inhabitants which gave Melba the welcome
of a £l5OO concert house on her arrival
there in 1910. The Skylark, by the way,
sent Christmas greetings “to all my friends
at Paling’s.”
George Upward, sen., Clerk of Committees
in the House of Reps., who was taken seri-
ously ill soon after his return from a holiday
trip to Europe, is convalescing hereabouts.
The hemorrhage that laid him low a few
weeks since might have been the death of
any ordinary man; but this Upward has the
strength of an old athlete who never overdid
it, so he expects to presently return to his
Parliamentary job like a giant refreshed
with physic.
An English tourist who recently skimmed
Maoriland’s hot lakes, enthuses on the Ser-
jeant bequest to the town of Wanganui.
After trembling on the edge of “Hell’s
Gates,” in the Rotorua district, the traveller
descended to the Wanganui River to cool off
by shooting rapids. She spent Christmas
with Mrs. Serjeant in the bustling little
town beside the famous river. This lady is the
widow of the Mr. Serjeant who died some
months ago, leaving his picturesque house
and grounds to Wanganui—the house for an
Art Gallery. The hamlet is less embarrassed
than many towns of its size would be at the
prospect of being morally forced to scour
the country for pictures to put into its
bequest, because the generous donor added
an endowment. So Wanganui, which is sup-
posed to yearn for Culture, having the larg-
est telescope in M.L. on its premises, will
enter into possession of its artistic nest with
the wherewithal to begin feathering it.
Yours affectionately,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER.
Melbourne, January 6, 1913.
My Dear Yarrie, —
The Denmans have decided on a trip to
the Apple Island. Help Barttelot, the hardy
soldier of the household, who does the skir-
mishing, has just returned with the report
that the Speck is well aired and suitable for
habitation.
The Standish and Bagot drew much that
was feathery and fluffy to the Flemington
course on New Year’s Day. G.-G. Denman
and party arrived shortly after noon, and
in a sandwich of policemen trudged the
length of the terrace to the old familiar
tootle. Her Ex. was plainly clothed, as
usual, the prevailing tint being a sort of
crushed mouse or bashed rhinoceros. The
garb of the female retinue aroused sight-
seeing shes to a fury of indifference, but his
Ex. was conspicuous for a lurid straw hat
that seemed to be suffering from a bilious
attack. The Barttelot man had encased his
thoughts in a “hot” band, so loud that one
couldn’t hear the Hebrews masticating dur-
ing lunch. Another member of the Govern-
ment House clan appeared as the parent of
a baby moustache, and his hand wavered
between attentions to his cane and the
little stranger. Byron Moore officiated in
a grey hat and canary gloves, and the
legs of Croker, of the girlish contours,
strutted like animated pen handles in the
vice-regal shade. Dr. Charlie Ryan was
saucily suited in the blue and white stripings
so fashionable now. Feathers were dreadfully
prevalent, and some of the finest surmounted
the lady who married “Sam” Nathan. The
best hat of the day, however, surmounted the
skull of a youth who retailed “squaw talk”
to a cluster of girls near the Denman pen.
The outrage was a high-crowned straw ar-
rangement, with a rim so narrow that I saw
three flies get dizzy and fall off it.
George Sydenham Clarke, ex-Governor of
Victoria, has selected his second name as a
suitable disguise with which to enter the
House of Lords. A second wife, by the way,
said to be well known in Sydney, now rules
the Sydenham destinies, and keeps the keys
of the dungeons dangling at her girdle.
The Denmans are giving a beanfeast or
something to the Post Office employees, on
Saturday, January 11. The function is to
spread from 3 p.m. till 6 p.m. The over-
worked sorters of Christmas mail matter
will all be there, likewise the footsore letter-
carrier who pants round with the card which
conveys in flowery language the bald infor-
mation that your friends and relations bear
you no ill will.
Eunie Russell, the fair Australian girl,
was married to her Chia at St. Peter’s, East
Melbourne, on Thursday, January 2. She
was an hour and more behind time at the
church ; and during this ominous pause the
bridesmaids yawned out loud, whilst the
waiting ’groom steeped himself in Mongolian
calm. He was supported in this trying hour
by his cousin, James Lee, over from Sydney.
When the belated heroine arrived, tragically
pale, and veiled in white, she walked to the
altar on the arm of her father, preceded by
eight spinsters, warbling the bridal march
from “Lohengrin,” and carrying staffs of
garlanded laurel; these they formed into an
arch of triumph for the bride and her two
pink-veiled traimbearers —Louise Knibbs
and Agnes Doyle. Canon Hughes turned on
the fullest High Church ceremony (lighted
candles and just a delicate whiff of incense),
and put an ornate High Church robe over
his surpliced shoulders ere stepping forward
to do the nasty job. The church was filled
with a curious mixture of Australians and
Chinese. Statistician Knibbs. the Daniels
couple and their daughter, and Mrs. P. and
O. Roberts figured prominently. The Shak-
spearian Mortons were also present, Mrs.
Morton wearing a frivolous little ruffle with
her wedding garb. The bride’s mother
looked nervous in an elegant outfit of black
and white satin, topped by an effective little
hat. The Chinese were in full English
dress ; included were numerous Chinese flap-
pers, with twin pigtails, tied with enormous
hows of pink or blue ribbon, hanging down
their backs. The aisle was decorated with
English daisies; but big bronze Chinese
bowls of blue flowers squatted heavily near
the altar rails of the temple.
Champagne and the wedding refreshments
were spread in a much-decorated room at
the Oriental Hotel. The ordinary hotel
guests, just drifting in to luncheon, criti-
cised aloofly in undertones, as the throng
streamed in to clink glasses. The bride’s
volatile girl friends skipped along the
lounges and corridors with gay young
Chinese in attendance. It was depressing
to watch the frisky Mongols, with confetti
in their straight black hair, prancing along
holding White Australian arms. After the
speeches had run their course, Mr. and Mrs.
Chia apparently went away to Spencer-
street station; but it was whispered that
they would motor down to Geelong, or some-
where, and leave next day for Sydney to
catch a China-bound boat.
Matthew Baird, M.P.. of Ballarat, has
married Miss Ruby Coutts, a charming con-
stituent. Baird is now the youngest mem-
ber in the Victorian House. (Alfred
Deakin, who represents Ballarat in the
Federal sphere, was the political infant of his
earlier day.) Baird’s brother politicians drank
his health in one or several of his alcoholic
foes. Matthew is one of the numerous ad-
miring sons of a grand old total abstainer,
and has no use for the soeiable vices. The
pair are now honeymooning in the Blue
Mountains.
One of the prospective bridesmaids in the
forthcoming Fairbairn marrying has to hand
over her lovely raiment to an understudy. A
death in the family has put her out of the
picture.
The invaluable Hood, who has stood at
the elbow of various Australian Excellencies,
is. due this month in Westralia, where he
will pick up Governor Strickland and convoy
him to N. S. Wales.
Black-eyed Dr. McCall, of Tasmania, who
has been Agent-Generalling for his State in
London, sped through Melbourne last week,
and made tracks across Bass Strait.
Mr. Walker, a grandson of the well-known
whisky, and partner in the family distillery,
is staying at Menzies’ with his bride. She
was a Miss Ramsay, of Brighton, and
through carelessness in contracting measles
while on her honeymoon, had to be hurriedly
shipped back to mother to be nursed. The
recovered bride is now wearing a renewed
complexion and the race frocks she was too
sick to trail through the damp days of Flem-
ington.
Dentist Frank Allen signals his engage-
ment to Dolly Martell, a winsome maiden
of Toorak.
Another theatrical pair got themselves
tethered in holy matrimony, on Christmas
Eve, at an East Melbourne kirk. The con-
tracting parties were Miss Elwyn Harvey
and Mr. Marks, brother to George Marlow,
the well-known dealer in bellowdrama. The
Marlow couple and Mrs. Harvey were the
only onlookers. By the way, Mrs. Rumor
is nowadays kept busy at the telephone ask-
ing if it really is a fact that Miss Blank
and Mr. Dash, of the Asche-Brayton co.,
are to be wedded.
The shaken McMahon lady, who was in-
jured some time ago by a vehement taxi, is
now well enough to start off on a European
trip.
The George Fairbairns are making a bolt
for Vancouver, partly for holiday, but prin-
cipally to look after some of George’s Cana-
dian interests. Daughter Mrs. Balmain, her
captain husband, and their numerous babies
also travel with the family party.
Rupert Clarke will spend some time in
Papua looking after his rubber and other
interests, whilst his lady awaits his coming
in the land of the Pharaohs. As soon as he
arrives they will saunter together up the
Nile, spelling awhile in Cairo on their way.
Mrs. Trail, the summer girl, who, years
back, annexed a vice-regal Help for a matri-
monial partner, is again saying good-bye to
home and mother. Though the Trails’ per-
manent camp is pitched in London, the lady’s
destination is at present India, where her
two boys are learning to defend the spotted
Empire. Ivy Clarke goes with the matron.
Charles Wheeler has not been staggered
by his first impressions of French art in
Paris. Says he to a friend in Melbourne: —
I’ve been putting in a few hours a day at one of
the schools, but the standard of work is very low.
I expected to see a lot of geniuses, but am disap-
pointed thus far. There may be one or two good
ones in each class ; the work of the rest is too painful.
The sketching, especially from the three-minute poses
of the nude, is the most interesting. It is very
strenuous. In the figure-group classes the lighting and
arrangement of the groups are a lesson in themselves.
There is quite an elaborate system of artificial light-
ing. . ..1 found the Autumn Salon an awful show. A
few good things suffered from their surroundings.
The work of the pert impressionists, the futurists,
the cubists and all the other distortionists is just
about the limit. If their work is Art, then certainly
Art is easy. One sees some very artistic-looking
freaks floating round the streets, but when I have
chanced to see their work it has invariably proved to
be bad.
One of the last and wildest newspaper
correspondents of 1912 was a man who had
been jolted to Fern Tree Gully and back
again in the usual cattle truck, after paying
first-class return fare. He seemed to think
the Victorian Snailway Department was dis-
honest ; in fact, he said so in heated ink.
His extreme annoyance marks him as either
a pampered stranger, or a local who has
hitherto eluded the Great Truck Pilgrimage
—for years past one of the established trans-
portation jests of Watt’s State. The real
Victorian picnicker never expects to be
taken to the Gully in anything but a cattle
truck. For most Gully pilgrims the outing
or exposure would lose its distinctive flavor
if they were given the first- or second-class
carriage for which they pay. Before a big
holiday, the Flinders-street sidings are full
of _ strings of tarpaulin-roofed bull pens,
which only need an engine apiece to con-
vert them into complete Gully expresses. The
intending bull-picnicker is well aware what
they are meant for, and he and the fair cow
he escorts don’t bellow about robbery. They
joyfully allow themselves to be trucked and
rattle their hoofs gaily in time to mouth-
organs, and the harmony is only marred
when a strange steer kicks violently in print
and represents that he has been salted.
Mrs. Wallach, a Toorak dame of distinc-
tion, is back from a trip to Germany, and
gloating over the fact that all her maids
have resigned their interim billets, and re-
turned to her standard in a body. As a
reward for such touching fidelity (to her-
self), she sent them off for a holiday, and
got along with the intermittent assistance
of charladies.
Socially important matrons and spinsters
of undamaged reputation, who intend mak-
ing tracks for London, have contracted .the
habit of keeping their plans dark, to save
themselves from being burdened with a for-
lorn damsel who desires their chaperonage
op the voyage. The girl-tripper whose rela-
tives will uUblushingly ask mere acquaint-
ances to mother her on the high seas is an
increasing nuisance. She is always an
anxiety and not infrequently an expense.
One family had their whole trip spoiled for
them by a strange girl, who, being thrust
into their little circle, unwanted and alone,
fell ill and nearly died. Then there is the
other variety of lamb that flirts recklessly
with the whole ship, and has to be pursued
in a Wowserish spirit day and night. It is
fearful to have to Wowse, whether you want
to or not, for the safety of an unknown
lamb’s reputation.
Some of our Most Expensive People are
still leading the unrestful life at Frankston.
Moondah was comfortably filled on New
Year’s Eve for the James Grices’ hop ; and
next evening daughter Nancy took a party on
to a similar revel at the Plarold Grim wade
place. Lesly Madden followed suit with a
bouquet of girls. At this function, slim
Mrs. Harold, all in white, decorated with
painted flowers, was supported by her
Colonel, wearing his golden smile. Brother
Norton and his wife, the latter in grey up-
holstery, were also in attendance. Secre-
tary Wilberforce (just now off duty) was
prominent in the gathering, which was in-
flated by motor-loads of town folks.
Major Campbell, who inherited a pile of
money from his mother this year, is doing
his best to revive the Cowes-to-Queenscliff
yacht race. The other day the Royal Yacht
Club entered five boats for some trophies
donated by the Major ; but only three of the
five started. The enthusiastic Campbell, is
having a boat built for himself. It is being
designed by Fife, of Fairlie, and, according
to its prospective owner, is to be Absolute
Perfection.
Molly_ Carew, who emulates Margaret
Cooper in songs-at-the-piano entertainments,
has formed a company, and is off to tour
Tasmania. Somebody in the wealthy Tread-
way clan owns Molly as niece, and is giving
her a helping hand.
News has been received of the death, in
Germany, of Mrs. Burrell. The big, hand-
some, fair-haired widow was one of the most
regular Melbourne first-nighters. Every im-
portant show saw her seated in the front
row. of the dress circle, with a frosty sparkle
of jewels covering her neck, and a critical
lorgnette trained on stage and audience.
Usually she brought pretty niece Ailsa Wil-
kinson with her. One night, during the
supper flight of motors, her car was involved
in an accident. She escaped (lightly, as she
thought) with a blow over the heart. The
consequences were long in coming; but they
arrived at last during a holiday jaunt in
Europe. The poor lady was engaged to be
re-married.
Editor Long, of the Victorian school
paper, opened fire the other day at certain
English writings of Mrs. Hubert Bland,
who accused Australian school literature of
scorning fairy lore. Long, after a spirited
defence, suggested that Mrs. Bland next time
should discuss Barataria. The lady who
has brought all this down on her head is
sister to Paris Nesbit, Adelaide’s most liter-
ary lawyer.
_By the death of Esther Eliza Osborne,
widow, of Momalong, South Yarra, a large
number of younger Osbornes, who were
already rich, have become disgracefully so.
The Osbornes, following the golden rule of
the original James Osborne, who was a pas-
toralist half a century or so ago, are mostly
“on the land.” Mrs. Osborne, just dead at
the age of 80, was one of the Houstons; and
Houston, also, was a name to conjure with
in the early days. One Osborne daughter
married Charles Fairbairn, and another be-
came the wife of Commander Simpson,
R.N. There are four Osborne sons —Jim,
Charlie, Henry and Major F.
In the places where fashion rages, the
latest craze is for grey hair—not all over
the head, understand, but on one side only.
A thoroughly up-to-date fashion-plater will
now be May to the east and December to
the west, as it were. Lesly Madden, the
Waxcellency’s only unmarried daughter, will
be right in the swim. She has a broad
streak of silver clearly defined on her other-
wise black locks.
Melbourne citizens, hurrying home late in
the afternoon, snigger at a pathetically
funny sight now and then. In the lines of
route to Flinders-street station earnest
females stand by the kerbstone offering
Votes for Women for sale. They hold the
poor little imported publication in front of
them as though it were a target; but nobody
pauses to throw them a penny, or whatever
its price is. The passing crowd has ceased to
even think of the organ of British suffra-
gettery, and when people don’t regard the
optimism of the smileless spinsters as a joke
they mostly think the poor ladies are earn-
ing a bob or two by advertising a new melo-
drama.
Amy Castles sent her Christmas greetings
to Australia in German on German cards
The wishes looked rather like good English
rubbed on a nutmeg grater.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Lieut. Harry Hawker, a son of the late G C
Hawker, has iust died in England as the resuit of
a hunting accident. His son Seymour is settled near
Blyth.
A thoroughly loyal crowd flocked to Glenelg on
Commemoration Day, and patronised the side-shows
and looked at the Gum Tree and the pioneers. The
Bosanquets assembled at the Town Hall, and were
entertained by Mayor Rounsevell. Also they made
and listened to speeches and did the right thing in
other respects. By the way, talking of festivities,
ex-Mayor of Glenelg Pearce has just had appendicitis.
Those who were unable to stand the sturrn und
drang, as the Teuton hath it, of a day at Glenelg,
went to Milang regatta. The event of the day was
a race between hydroplanes owned, by Gordon Mac-
Farlane and Keith Bowman. The MacFarlane craft
won, its rival jibbing doggedly at an early stage.
The Michael Hawkers, O’Learys, Arthur Rymills,
Lancelot Stirlings, and Formbys surveyed the pro-
ceedings from motor-cars.
Rutherford Purnell, our new Public Librarian, is
due here on February 15.
Artist Will Ashton left by the Geelong, on the
quest which I spoke of in a former letter. Before he
did so his pupils gave him the customary gold watch.
Dingley Dell, the poet Gordon’s cottage near Mount
Gambier. is to be offered for sale in a few days by
its owner, Mr. Robert Lawson, of Padthaway station.
It isn’t unlikely that there will be a bid for it on
the public’s behalf.
Lady Bosanquet attended the New Year’s Day races
at Morphettville in cloudy blue. One daughter wore
white and another biscuit ninon. Mrs. Row’s twine-
colored frock had touches of black, and Mrs. Albion
Tolley’s dress of cream embroidery looked delight-
fully cool. Mrs. Tom Barr-Smith wore a smart fou-
lard with a beplumed hat. With her was her niece,
Miss Betty Hawker, who with her mother, Mrs.
Acres, arrived last week in the Osterley. They are
at Mount Barker.
At the recent jubilee celebration of a big local
firm, the employees wound up by singing “Praise God
from Whom All Blessings Flow.” It’s not often, in
these days of strife and industrial unrest, that em-
ployees canonise, let alone deify, their employers.
Sincerely yours,
JOHANNA.

You can neither make nor buy lemon squash as
good as O.T. Co.’s “Kia-Ora” brand. This drink is
made from squashed lemons and pure sugar only, and
is recommended with the utmost confidence for use
in hot weather when lemon-juice is so cooling, re-
freshing and so health-giving. “Kia-Ora” owes its
excellence to the choice fruit used, to a scrupulous
regard for purity and cleanliness, and to special
methods of manufacture. Compare it with home-
made or other bottled squashes,, and you will notice
its superiority.*

POLITICAL
POINTS
“Bobstay” from a wharfside
Trouble is predicted in the N. S. Wales coast
trade. The High Court has upset Justice Hig-
gins’s arbitration award for ships’ officers, and
Allen Taylor and Co. promptly gave notice
that they would not consider themselves bound
by the award after January 21. The Merchant
Service Guild, which spent much time and money
in securing this award, immediately began to cast
round for firm anchorage on the ground it had
gained. The first idea was to join the Australian
Transport Union, and thus be able to fall back on
the support of the seamen, wharf laborers and carters
if the worst came to the worst. This scheme was not
embraced with warmth by the officers. They recog-
nised the great value the allied support of the trans-
port workers would be, but they realised that the
quid pro quo might be too expensive a luxury, especi-
ally in view of the wharfies’ casual habit of going
on strike. The present idea is that the State Govern-
ment should intervene and set up a Wages Board to
decide the matter; but as a State Board has limited
jurisdiction, and cannot follow the ships into other
States, this proposal does not offer much satisfaction.
It would be far more to the point if the State Gov-
ernment would bog in and help carry the Referendum
proposals. This would make valid an award such as
Justice Higgins entered up in the case, and would en-
able the Commonwealth to deal effectively with ship-
ping affairs generally. As it is, there is merely a
tendency to Bedlam in those affairs.
THE VALUE OF IGNORANCE.
The Commonwealth Government proposes to issue
a pamphlet containing arguments for and against
the Referenda. The Attorney-General will argue
“Yes”; the Opposition will state the case for the
other side. The daily papers are very annoyed about
it.
GRANNY: " You ongrateful little cuss! Throw
that common novel away and read this , if
you must waste your time readin' at all.”
The S. M. Herald occasionally gives a
lift to its friend the House Where the Time
is Never Ripe. The other day it remarked,
apropos some recent legislation :
The difficulty which lies in the Minister’s way is
the impracticability of the Bill as it emerged from
the Legislative Council. When it left the Assembly
it was at least workable.... The Act as it stands
is practically valueless.
A fine testimony this to the House of Re-
view, whose disappearance would cause
Chaos!
Only one Australian politician was in-
cluded in the New Year list of kniglits. That
one was Tim Quinlan, the Westralian
Speaker—the enlightened statesman who
thinks so highly of State Frights that he
once expressed the opinion that John Forrest
ought to be stewed in oil or something for
his services to Federation.
The holiday shark-scares at various Vic-
torian bathing resorts recall the fact that in
the ’7o’s the Government used to pass money
on the estimates for destroying the pest.
A bonus was paid for carcases —so much
per foot. The result was the building up of
a promising industry. The fishermen brought
in to the inspectors hundreds of small and
harmless blunt-toothed dogfish, and the in-
spectors knew so condemned little about
sharks that they paid up pleasantly. Hun-
dreds of pounds went in this way, until a
soulless Government came in and retrenched
the shark off the estimates.
“Konini,” his tip :
A significant announcement was made last week
in the M.L. press that Prime Minister Fisher in-
formed Defence Minister Allen, of M.L., that he
(Fisher) intended to visit the Land of the ex-Moa
early this year. Unfortunately, pressure of business
has blocked the proposal. Ostensibly the visit was
to have been a holiday trip, but the certainty is that
behind it lay the hope of Fisher (and probably
Allen) that amalgamated defence would be
brought nearer. Allen passed through Mel-
bourne a couple of weeks ago, en route to Lon-
don, where he will get the feeling of the Admiralty
concerning M.L.’s naval scheme. As this scheme
(subsidy to the Home-waters navy) is the very
thing the Admiralty told Australia to drop in favor
of local units to the Fleet, Maoriland’s Defence
Minister will most likely come back with his own
view confirmed. His view is that Canada, Australia
and Maoriland will one day join hands for the
white man’s defence of the Pacific, and I’m tipping
that the Australian and M.L. Governments will before
long be making a start at that very necessary job.
Dr. Findlay move a spur into the flank
of N.SAV. when, the other day in Sydney,
he pouted his chest proudly over the success
of Maoriland’s scheme of afforestation by
prison labor. The N.S.W. Parliament ap-
proved of the principle of employing prison
labor in that manner, but Ma’s administra-
tion is cursed with the fear of going too
fast, and treading on somebody’s feet. Most
Maoriland prisons now yield some inmates to
the healthy outdoor work of forestry.
Millions of seedlings are the result, and last
year 268 acres were planted, and a great
deal more was got ready for planting. _ The
enterprise is not only sound commercially,
but has a most admirable effect on prisoners.
To win the privilege of being drafted to an
afforestation camp, the prisoner must show
a disposition to profit by the more liberal
treatment, and that disposition is being
widely manifested.
The S. M. Herald goes far afield to pick
up arguments against Protection and Home
manufactures. In Argentina, the ancient
paper says, the manufacture of cornsacks
is encouraged by “a prohibitive duty,” and
the result is that the manufacturing firms
pay as much as 50 per cent, dividends. The
Herald, however, needn’t trouble about the
50 per cent, dividend ;
what it ought to tell
is whether the Argen-
tina farmer is paying
any more for corn-
sacks than the Aus-
tralian farmer. The
position is just this:
Australia depends ab-
solutely on the Cal-
cutta manufacturer,
and there is nothing
to stop the latter and
the men who handle
the goods making 100
per cent, profit. But
if the goods were
made in Australia,
then the law might
protect the Australian
farmer against such
daylight robbery—
provided, of course,
the farmer votes to
give the Common-
wealth the necessary power to control mono-
polies, combines, etc.
A small, tentative sort of movement, in
Gippsland, possibly marks an early step in
a disruptive action that will break up the
existing cumbrous, capital-ridden States of
the Commonwealth. Woodside Progress
Association has reached the conclusion that
Gippsland would be better developed under
Commonwealth control, and wants sever-
ance from Victoria. Remembering how it
has, although long settled, been neglected
in railways, closer settlement, provision of
harbors, etc., there is much excuse for the
idea. Also, now that .Portland, in the West,
is to get its harbor, and a railway running
straight inland, Bruthen, Orbost, Port Al-
bert and other places are asking what about
them. Some day, when Woodside and these
other remote, neglected settlements think
their own thoughts, and leave off thinking
those supplied by their alleged political lead-
ers, they will conclude that the reform they
need is unification, accompanied by the in-
evitable redistribution of the continent into
local-governing areas instead of the present
unwieldy States.
The proposal to use light nickel coins in
place of heavy bronze counters has been
turned down for a while by the Federal Gov-
ernment. After examining samples of _ the
coinage of many countries, the authorities
have ordered a new supply of coppers from
England. Australia is wildly progressive in
these matters. Decimal coinage was _ pro-
mised a long time ago, but the public is
still busy adding up the old irregular figures
and calculating 20 dozen pennies to the
pound. The time wasted on the job would
go far, if put on a cash basis, to pay the
interest on the cost of the railway to the
Northern Territory.
THE N.S.W. SPOILITICAL MACHINES.
THE INTERLOPER (to Tweedledee and I'weedle-
dum): “’Ere, you fellows, make room —
I'm little Tweedledeedledum .”
At the end of the year Commonwealth
notes to the value of £10,012,275 had been
called for. This increase of over £500,000
in the last six months is further proof, no
doubt, of the “Liberal” papers’ old conten-
tion that, under a Labor Government, the
community would so utterly distrust, the
Treasury that it wouldn’t touch the “Fisher
flimsies.”
In a brief sentence, the other day, Frank
Bond, a member of the Tasmanian House
of Dodery, put the whole case for that
Chamber of Dead Weights. The question
was the proposed removal of some rocks
from the river. Whereupon Bond remarked
that, as the rocks had been in the river for
probably hundreds of years, he saw no need
to hurry in removing them now.
The Argus discovers the end of Australia
in practically every sensible modern meas-
ure ; but the new Federal law which de-
mands that every person coming to Aus-
tralia must present a clean bill of health is
the dead finish. It will drive capital from
the country, it will choke off rich tourists,
repel immigrants, and hand the Common-
wealth over to desolation and destitution.
“Nothing but an unworthy feeling of class
malevolence could prompt anyone to pro-
pose such a law,” the Argus concludes. All
because better-class people will be expected
to “scuffle their way through the herd to be
examined by a Commonwealth doctor.” The
Argus idea seems to be that genteel people
do not have low, vulgar diseases, or, if they
do have them, Australia should be ready to
welcome those ailments because they are
attached to “naice” people.
Following the lead of Queensland, Car-
michael, N.S.W. Minister for Public In-
struction, has equipped one or two
travelling schools —tents mounted on wheels
or something of the sort —to send them
wherever the foot of youth can tread. The
business will be expensive, but the cultiva-
tion of one good brain which would other-
wise go to waste may pay for the lot. Be-
sides, an educated democracv won’t for ever
tolerate a state of affairs by which popula-
tion is systematically drawn away from
the country to swell the overcrowded city;
and thus the education waggon on its rounds
will help to do work which will make edu-
cation waggons unnecessary.
“If every employee were a trade union-
ist,” says the Argus, “there would simply
be no profit in belonging to a union.” Also,
if every class of workers were a combined
body, exacting the maximum of possible
payment for its services, Capital would be
impoverished and Labor would gain nothing
by its “short-sighted selfishness.” The
Argus, therefore, indirectly exhorts salary-
earners to suffer the ills they have rather
than strike for more. But as bank clerks
in sundry places have struck for improved
pittances and achieved a rise without re-
ducing the half-yearly div., and as black-
coated office and warehouse workers every-
where notice that the boss’s margin of pro-
fit offers scope for further encroachments,
the warnings of the Argus are losing force
even in the most select boarding-houses.
And, anyway, assuming that ‘ there would
simply be no profit in belonging to a union”
if unionism were universal, the argument
doesn’t affect the admitted fact that there
is a harder time coming for wage-earners
who don’t belong to a union. Even the,
action that brings no profit is better than
the o'assivity that suffers a steadily-increas-
ing loss.
Tasmania’s Agent-General, Dr. McCall, is
on furlough in his native Speck. He wouldn’t
mind changing London for the Speck for
good if he could see a way into the House
of Reps. He has vague designs on the Dar-
win seat, hitherto impregnable; if he will
go, Marshall, the selected candidate (he is
president of the Liberal League), will re-
tire. In that case Kink O’Malley will have
the fight of his Tasmanian life.
The Maoriland anti-barmaid legislation is
a drunken sort of thing that has been reel-
ing round its object for a couple of years
despite the efforts of two Parliaments to
straighten it up and make it get
work. When Ward was in the
saddle, a Licensing Amendment
Act was passed providing for the
registration of barmaidens before
a specified date, after which no
more could be enrolled. When the
last of those registered had died,
the species was to become extinct.
But somebody found a flaw in the
Act through which unregistered
girls could be coaxed or dragged,
and Premier Massey was hurriedly
called up to repair the chasm. Ap-
parently his amending Act has also
failed to do the needful, as new
girls are still getting to work in
Bung’s private bars. The other
day it was sprung on the Minister
for Justice that the law did not
know there was such a place as a
“private” bar; that it had no defi-
nition or knowledge of it. Which
so disturbed the Minister that he
sooled the Crown Law officers at the ques-
tion with unusual velocity. They were still
sooling when the mail left.
For the past six months the Common-
wealth’s Customs revenue has been
£7,955.747, or no less than £937,031 more
than for the corresponding half of the pre-
vious year; and according to present indica-
tions the full year’s revenue from Customs
and Excise will be £2,000,000 above the Gov-
ernment’s own estimate. This means that
the present tarifE will let in approximately
£8,000,000 more foreign goods during the
year than the Government anticipated. And
still the Government turns a deaf ear to
every appeal for the scientific revision of the
tariff in order to make it do for Australian
industries what it was designed to do.
Resolution'lately carried by the Padding-
ton (Sydney) Labor League:—
That the Defence Act should be so amended as
to provide that military training shall be compul-
sory for children between the ages of 12 and 21,
and that for all over the age of 21 military service
shall be purely voluntary.
More shirk ! The Defence Act does aim to
get there —in a very gradual fashion, it is
true —by carrying forward the voteless kids’
military training a few years beyond the
kid stage; but this precious League wants
to abolish even that trifle of national de-
cency, and pile all the graft on the young-
ster. Nothing more fully proves the danger
of making the training voluntary than the
desire of such a large number of loafers to
have it so.
THE ENCOUNTER.
The Tasmanian Parliament has had a premature
dissolution. Premier Solomon (Liberal) blamed the
Labor party for trying to obtain office.
Sad news item.
Still another industry is making unplea-
sant noises in its throat, while the outside
combine is announcing its big profits. After
a three years’ struggle, the Australian
Thread Co., which has been making gallant
attempts to establish a factory at Fitzroy
(Melb.), finds itself compelled to reduce its
skilled staff. Meanwhile, J. and P. Coats

intimate that they made about £3,000,000

SAMMY MAUGER HAS A CHANCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
But with the full sense of the seriousness of the
action taken in selecting Mr. Mauger, and of our own
responsibility to the party, we must make it clear
that Mr. Mauger’s candidature can receive no sup-
port in these columns. —Argus.
Sam Mauger is the Wowser brand ;
The nation he would save from slaughter
By Sabbatarian methods, and
With liberal goes of milk and water.
The country doesn’t want a bloke
Of Samuel’s legislative stature,
Who’s half fanatic, half a joke ;
Yet he may ride a winning moke
If but the Argus don’t revoke,
And barrack for his candidature.
Support in Argus columns now
Is like the breath of upas reckoned.
Its ink is death-dew on the brow —
’Twill kill a cat in half a second.
How many men it chased to smite
Found cover in the Legislature!
So Sammy has his chance, and might
Come decked with laurels from the fight
If Argus doesn’t, just for spite,
Support and bless his candidature!
VICTORIA.

“The Butterfly Man,”
and “The Alternative.”
By GEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON. Price 1/-, Post Free 1/1
Here we have two books for the price of one, and both are equally
good. “The Butterfly Man,” indeed, ranks amongst one of the
cleverest things of its kind, and enhanced this author’s reputation
materially.
Essentially a book for young men, sisters and mothers, this work
draws such a pen picture of a selfish society butterfly that most people
will at once exclaim, “Just like young So-and-so.”
The young man’s awakening is swift, severe and uncompromising;
his downfall complete, and the conclusion of the story just as every-
one hoped for.
“The Alternative” is a delightful story in McCutcheon’s best style,
and must be read to be appreciated.
“What’s- His- Name?”
By GEORGE BARR McCUTCHEON.
Price 1/-, Post Free 1/1.
By arrangement with the American publishers, Dodd, Mead & Co., of
Jsew York, the N.S.W. Bookstall Co., Ltd., are able to put this
famous author’s expensive book on the Australian market at the low
price of one shilling, and those who are not conversant with the great
American’s work should lose no time in reading “What’s-His-Name?”
This is a charming story of a man who was always known as
“What’s-His-Name? You know. Nellie Duluth’s husband.”
Nellie was a favorite actress, whose profession permitted her no time
to attend to her home, with the results related in the book. An excep-
tionally interesting story, with a surprising finish of great power.

WONDERFUL RESULTS FROM
TAKING DR. MORSE’S INDIAN
ROOT PILLS.
Nothing is more worrying to people, es-
pecially ladies, than to have their com-
plexion spoiled by pimples and blotches.
These are invariably due to poor condition
of the blood, caused by a disordered liver not
performing its functions, and a reined' 7 that
will set the liver right is consequently the
only thing to free one from these disfiguring
and painful eruptions. An excellent in-
stance of the efficacy of Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills as a blood purifying remedy is
related by Miss Violet Bayley, of 3 Moores
Street, off Botany Road, Alexandria, who
writes: —-
“Just a few lines to say that I have
been taking Dr. Morse’s Indian Root Pills
and find they do me a vreat amount of
good. Previously I was always suffering
from bilous attacks; in addition to this I
had red patches on my face, and was languid
and. tired every day. Having taken doctors’
medicines without feeling any the better for it,
and as one of my cousins had received a
great deal of benefit from Dr. Morse’s Indian
Root Pills, on his recommendation I tried
them and found they just suited my consti-
tution, and now always keep them in the
house and recommend them to my friends.
I am also pleased to state they do my mother
a lot of good too. You have my permission
to use this statement for advertising pur-
poses.’”"

SPORTING
NOTIONS
The Jack Read-Frank Picato fight at
Sydney Stadium on Saturday night was a wild and
joyous riot, in which the average speed was probably
greater than that of any other contest seen in that
ring. Picato, the United States citizen of Italian
extraction, who used to be a welter weight, was on
this occasion only lib. heavier than the Australian,
who kicked the beam at 9st. lOilb. But in shedding
his tissue he did not appear to have lost any of the
strength and toughness that made him so formidable.
The scrap divided itself into three epochs. The first
was a wild and strenuous whirling and walloping,
which exhausted the boilers of both battlers. Read
had the best of that. In the second period they both
slowed down, and Read in particular sparred as much
as possible for wind. This was Picato’s. The third
began in the 17th round, when Read came back with
fresh strength and gave Picato Sheol. Read has been
training with Samuel Langford, the sawn-off giant,
and profited much. He has always used the straight
left fairly well, but on Saturday night he used it
better than ever ; also he had discovered that he has a
right, and that it has its uses in battle. He was the
better boxer of the two, and the battle became a duel
between the better boxer and the better fighter. And,
as is always . the case when the boxer’s strength and
courage are equal to those of the fighter, the boxer
won. Picato went in from the bound-off to get a
knock-out with the right; but his timing was faulty
and he failed to achieve it. Read showed excellent
footwork, and turned the persistent crowding of
Picato into' the means to inflict heavy punishment.
Over and over again he baulked Picato’s attack with
a tap on the nose from the left, and then danced
elegantly out of danger; Picato would crowd after
him, and then Read would hook him on the right
eye and use the right. Some terrific countering took
place, and both men showed skill in taking dangerous
wallops on the glove. Early in the fight Picato
knocked a tooth clean out of Read’s lower jaw and
cut his lip badly; and Read responded by closing
Picato’s right eye and spoiling the efficiency of the
left. The damage inflicted on the foreigner’s lamps-
had, no doubt, much to do with his bad timing, for
one occasion saw Read so weak he could no longer hit
effectively, and was capable of nothing better than a
nush. Some of the pushes were, however, turned into
heavy jolts by Picato rushing in, and, though they
were his own creations, they shook the visitor badly.
Picato, like all the Americans, takes punishment in
order to get close and deliver his fatal wallop. But
Read watched that uppercut, and smashed and
smashed like a Trojan. When the gong went both
sat down, and looked eagerly at the re f eree as he re-
ceived the slips from the judges. Scott read the
notes and then pointed to Read. For once in his life
the writer heartily agreed with the decision.
During the wildest moments of his fight with Read.
Picato wore an expression of child-like innocence, and
he sighed sadly as he shaped up after a clinch, and
went to work doggedly. It was the expression of a
schoolboy who has been forced into the unpleasant
task of giving a mate the father of a hiding. His
bad timing lost him the fight, and, as said before,
it was most probably due to the fact that he could
not see properly with one eye. He was brave, hit
hard, took his gruel, and though all but outed in the
11th and again in the 13th, he recovered like a flash,
and in less than three seconds was attacking as
fiercely as ever. Read was often in distress, but
Picato seemed incapable of taking advantage of the
openings, especially in the 16th round. The stoush-
ing sprint that Read let loose during the last three
rounds will never be forgotten by those who saw it.
Tt was tremendous. They will meet again shortly.
A 1 Palzer, sometime chief White Hope of
the States, has gone bung. First of all, Tonv Ross,
a stripling some 2st. lighter, gave him a livelv time
for the six rounds the fight lasted. Palzer got the
verdict, but his own manager admitted that it took
him all he knew to win. It was a bad slump, which
the manager explained as the result of a bad cold
and consequent lack of condition. Worse was in
store when he met Luther McCarty, and got a fearful
’'iding. McCarty was quite as strong- and tough as
Palzer, and beat his man to mush, just as he had
beaten Jim Flvnn a few months before. There is
talk of allowing .Tack Johnson to come back to the
ring if he gets through the remainder of his White
Slave troubles unscathed, and if it is considered that
there is a White Hope capable of avenging the White
Slaves. If this comes off. Luther McCartv will go
looking for the job. despite the warnings of the
cognoscenti not to let his vaulting ambition o’er-
leap itself.
Brisbane will probably g°t more than its
money’s worth shortly, as Balzac, the French
sirocco, is matched to meet there the aboriginal
middle-weight bruiser, Jerome. The abo. is a bound-
ing, rushing battler of the same type as Balzac him-
self, and when they meet in mid-air it will be a sight
worth seeing. Mr. Baker ought to give Sydney a
show to watch the phenomenon.
The New York Boxing Commission, which
recently asked the Paris governing body to come to
a working affiliation, now contemplates bringing into
existence an international Board of Control, cover-
ing the U.S., Canada, Britain and France, and, if
possible, S’Africa. The idea is an excellent one.
Among the first questions to be considered by the
Board, if it comes off, will be a set of rules to
govern the world championships of all classes, and
the adoption of a universal scale of weights.
* * * *
People who had their doubts about Dave
Smith being a world phenomenon had them all veri-
fied by his wretched showing against de Balzac on
New Year’s Day. While the brilliant, but ephemeral,
Frenchman lasted, he got all over the Australian,
despite the fact that the latter had the advantage of
71b. weight. But Balzac cannot take punishment.
Had he been able to do so, Smith’s name would have
vanished from the list of fighters, for the Frenchman
would have pounded him to mush. Balzac should
place himself for six months under some professional
dog-trainer, the sort that hardens up bulldogs. Then,
when he had learned to time his wallops, he would
be a mighty fighter indeed.
There were some weird doings on the
cricket pitches of Sydney on Saturday. The soil was
not in good condition for batsmen, but the bowlers
voted it splendid. The greatest staggerer was the
match between North Sydney and Middle Harbor. It
was only the opening of the eighth round, yet when
the stumps were drawn Middle Harbor was down and
out with 53 and 65 to the 117 and four for no wickets
of the Northmen. The Cock of the Teams had won
by 10 wickets. The damage was wrought by bowlers
Hopkins and Hordern, who made a terrific display.
In the first innings Hordern took five for 26 and
Hopkins five for 21. In the second, Hopkins took
four for 32 and Hordern six for 26, which gave
Hordern 11 for 52 and Hopkins nine for 53. It
sounds more like Tom Brown’s school days than Syd-
ney First Grade Cricket. Apart from the bowling, North
Sydney’s play was nothing to issue a special edition
about. The highest score was the 26 of Moore, the
only other double figures were 25, 22, 18 and 12, and
five Northern batsmen fell to Bull for 48, while Gee
took four for 33. Thus, even North Sydney’s amaz-
ing win had its seamy side. University dismissed
Petersham for 41 (Massie taking seven for 18, and
only one Petersham man making double figures), and
then patted up 191. When night came Petersham
was following on. Redfern smashed up Balmain for
89, bowlers Emery and Mailey taking six for 45 and
four for 41 respectively; after which th,e Syrian
suburb proceeded to biff 294 for eight wickets. Bal-
main seems to have a fair chance of reaching the
tureen. Central Cumberland got its fangs right into
Waverley; it chewed up the Cemetery suburb for
88 and took two wickets for 12 runs in the second
innings, after putting 285 to its own credit. The
destroying angel this time was Pye, with four wic-
kets for 28 ; he was assisted by Strange, who got two
for 12. With Watson’s five wickets for 18 and Kelle-
way’s five for 31, Glebe dismissed Sydney for 73, and
then smacked 165 for eight wickets. It might have
smacked more but for the bowling of Collins, who
captured seven for 57. In fact, the only teams which
played anything like a level game were Paddington
and Burwood, and that was far from being what the
judges would pass in horseracing. Paddington dis-
appeared for 112, owing to Dive taking four sticks
for 34 runs and Docker four for 29. Burwood then
went in and hoisted 152 for three wickets. Alto-
gether it was remarkable cricket, graced by only one
century, the 144 by Waddy, for Central Cumberland.
* * * *
The Melbourne New Year’s inter-State
match was mostly an episode in disasters to the
Sorry Six. South Aus. got first try on a batsman’s
wicket and totted up 309, Crawford, Mayne and
Clem Hill making most of them. The Vies re-
sponded with 229, colts E. V. Carroll and Ryder
and Australian stumper Carkeek accounting for 141
of them. In the Croweaters’ second innings Ryder
got busy and wiped out five for 15, before stumps
were drawn, the tally being then 39. On Thursday
ni «ht heavy rain fell, and Ryder and Armstrong
speedily polished off the others, the colt getting
seven for 53, and the big Melbournian three for 34"!
Mayne again showed up as a batsman, with 52, and
Gehrs put together 31 n.o. Clem Hill made 17.
Carkeek again “kept” brilliantly, catching four and
allowing only five sundries in the total of 128.
With 209 to get on a rotten pitch the outlook of
the Cabbage Gardeners wasn’t promising, and it got
less so when, after a few wickets had fallen for a
score or so, the reliable veterans, Armstrong and
Ransford, went for 1 and 21 respectively; Ryder
made 16 and colt Baring 76. Being as much as 68
runs to the bad, Jimmy Matthews, whose hand had
been smashed in the first innings, wasn’t called on,
and the discussion ended in South Aus. getting a
second leg-in for the Sheffield Shield. Whitty took
five for 65, and Crawford 2 for 49. Of the oldsters
only Mayne, Whitty and Carkeek added to their
reputations, and of the youngsters only Ryder, Bar-
ing and perhaps Carroll made good.
On Saturday the V.C.A. chased the casual
sprat by pitting the Victorian 11 against 13 juniors.
The latter went in and showed such scant respect
for the State Xl’s bowlers that thev closed their
innings at 230 for six wickets, and set about
demolishing the seniors, but failed to do it in the
time. Of the 230 Hotchin, of St. Kilda, made 70
in easy, confident fashion, and Willis, of ’Varsitv,
37 n. 0., while A. Brown, of ’Wood, who was Gold-
street State School champion but two years ago,
rattled up 36 as swiftly and resolutely as though he
were still plaving among the nippers. Ryder got
two wickets for 31, and Armstrong two for 24, but
the others failed to distinguish themselves.
* * * *
In the Bathurst (N.S.W.) Association
competition last Saturday. Eglinton overwhelmed
Dunkeld by 157 runs, the downfall being due to the
ferocious bowling of a youngster named Freeman.
He took eight wickets for seven runs, and collared
the last four batsmen with consecutive deliveries.
He should be heard of again,' unless the opposition
was quite hopeless.
* * * *
South Australia’s 569. made the other
day, came within six of the State’s best against
N.S.W. When that record was made the glory was
all Clem Hill’s—36s not out. But that is 12 years
ago.
South Aus., having trampled down N.S.W.
and Victoria, looks like the next keeper of the Shef-
field Shield. At present the Wheat State has two
wins to Vic.’s one and Ma’s none. If South Aus.
can overthrow Ma once more next Saturday, the
Shield will start for Adelaide instanter.
* * * *
Tasmania’s annual cricket upheaval, be-
tween the North and South, at Hobart, was a very
one-horse affair. North never had a show; it was
stamped flat by an innings and 58 runs. It wasn’t
a defeat; it was annihilation.
Although the S’Africans could make no
impression on Old England at cricket, they are
having the time of their lives with step-father at
football. In fact, the whole British Isles is in-
cluded in the sweep of their revenge. England. Ire-
land, Scotland and Wales having been trampled in
the muck. Never was such a record put up before,
even the immortal “All Blacks” being unable to
pull Wales down. But this time Taffy was right
off his cheese, or something equally distressing.
It came as a surprise to sporting circles
in Sydney last week when W. F. Corbett crossed
from the Sunday Times to the Sun. Corbett and
the Referee and Sunday Times were looked upon
as one and indivisible, and had appeared to be so
more years than most Sydney journalists can remem-
ber. He covered a wide area, being the boxing auth-
ority, the bowling chronicler, the swimming expert,
the card oracle and the golfing rhadamanthus. On
his departure the whole establishment rose up and
drank his health, and shoved into his pocket a vast
silver epergne fruit stand, almost as big as his
genial self. His place as Boxing Editor in the S.T.
building has been taken by Mr. Lawless.
No matter what its nationality may be,
the Law is liable to be an ass; but the charm of
French law is that it is a subtle ass, and that sort
of donkey may be more entertaining than a philo-
sopher. A touring car was running through a small
French town recently, when, owing to the bursting
of a tyre, it swung round, sprang through a shop
window, and was pulled up only just in time to pre-
vent it sweeping through a crowded counter. There
was much excitement; in fact, only the storekeeper
remained cool, and by the time things were ready
for an exit, he held a bill under the nose of the
owner. The owner, who was in the car, declined re-
sponsibility. He did not, he said, wilfully burst his
own tyre to the risk of himself and his family. It
was the work of a Higher Power. Was he to pay
damages for the act of a Higher Power ? Sacre!
The angry shopkeeper took him to court, but that
august institution decided that the whole trouble
was due to the unexpected bursting of the tyre,
which was evidently and obviouslv the deed of a
Higher Power, and, therefore, no liability could lie
at the door of the defendant. How would Australian
motorists like to import that Judge, court and all?
Berlin city authorities have ukased that
no person driving any sort of automobile shall, while
so engaged, smoke pipe, cigar, cigarette, or substitute
therefor. The city authorities declare that smoking
by car-drivers has been responsible for a lot of acci-
dents, and must be put down. And in spite of a
mighty uproar, it has been put down. Smoking in
a car is a vain thing, anyway. The rush of air
smokes the pipe, cigar or cigarette for the smoker,
and there is no joy or satisfaction in it. It’s like
kissing a girl through her rain-cloak.
The latest is a new automobile paint or
varnish, called Lumino Aluminium. Said that on
a dark night. the glow is such that an otherwise un-
lighted car is visible two miles away. When the
makers first started experimenting with the sub-
stance in the neighborhood of the factory, the people
thereabouts unanimously decided to take the pledge,
as liquor which produced such visions was not good
for quiet country folk.
* * * *
The conditions for the recent motor-cycle
reliability race between Melbourne and Sydney were
not sufficiently stringent, and the result is that
there are practically 15 winners, or that the win
is divided among 15 riders, whichever you like. The
hero of the ride was one Tyler, who, when he had
smashed his bike into several pieces and jagged
himself all over, cut down saplings, and with them
and wire patched the machine up and rode through
to the finish. It was a valorous performance.
The Continental Rubber Co. is going to
organise a Motor-Bike Reliability Test between
Sydnev and Melbourne, to take place towards the
end of the year. An early start has been made with
a view to having the most perfect test ever made in
Australia ; and these things take a lot of organising.
The first excitement in the Six-Days’
Bicycle Race in Sydney was when secretary O’Brien
called the men off the track, and explained that un-
less they maintained an average speed of not less
than 10 miles an hour he would close the whole
show. The threat of O’Brien was followed up by a
somewhat impressive demonstration by the crowd,
some of whom threatened to kick the livers out of
the riders unless they “shook things up.” The riders,
it might be explained, were just crawling round the
ring. Six-day riders do that sort of thing in the
States, till the manager comes out and offers a special
prize for the man who does the longest distance that
afternoon, or yells that there’s 100 dollars waiting
for the man first over the 500-mile mark. Then the
rush commences. But the game did not work in Syd-
ney, the management being dense and unaccustomed
to the refinements of civilisation. A certain number
of special prizes had been arranged for, and the man-
agement was not to be bluffed into giving more. The
real tribulations of the riders commenced on the
Friday. In the morning it was sweltering, and the
riders wore cabbage leaves under their hats, for on
the asphalt track the temperature was 150° or so.
B.v 2.30 that afternoon showers of driving rain were
sweeping the track, making riding impossible. The
cyclists took refuge in the stands, and when the rain
slackened went back on roadster machines, wrapped
m their overcoats. At 8 o’clock the same evenm" a
special prize was offered for the passing of the 1500-
l™it, and a rush for the money took place.
After that special prizes became quite common, the
interest of the moneyed spectators rousing them to
the point of putting up special lures to fast riding.
The race ended at 10 o’clock on Saturday night with
half -mile snrint, in which" MacNamara
(N.S.W.) stalled off the game and fast-finishing
Spears, and landed the bacon. MacNamara’s team
mate was F. P. Corry. Spears, who raced him so
hard, is also a N.S.W. rider, and was partnered with
Don Kirkham. the Victorian crack. The third team
was that of Bert Scott rN.S.W.) and Keefe, the Tas-
manian flier. The total distance covered was 1833
miles as against 2086 miles last year. The world
record is 2717 miles.

i-, (picturesque figure of the Sydney Six
Days Race was Applehans, the German partner of
Rosseau, the Frenchman. These two seem to have
buried the iB7O hatchet, and have travelled the
world together. On this occasion Rosseau was in-
disposed, but Applehans declined to take another
partner, and did the bulk of the riding himself
during the earlier days. Towards the end of the
race Rosseau recovered, and the two settled down
grimly to the task of wiping off the deficit. When
it was suggested that the team retire Applehans
remarked that they would die first, and by dint of
splendid sprinting they got into the final and took
part in the dead heat for the eighth prize. They
were the heroes of the race, which thev tackled when
only three days off the boat, and their plucky effort
was rewarded by a special prize given for the most
meritorious ride. They will have another chance
in the Melbourne race.
The single-handed bowling championship
of the continent was trundled off at Carlton green
(Melb.) on Saturday last, and resulted in a boil-
over. Only four were in it, Sayers. (Ballarat), Barr
f North Fitzroy), Pascoe (Windsor) and Marsh
(M.C.C.). Pascoe was odds-on; Barr was second
in popular favor; and Marsh, the' colt, had his
followers. Sayers was the outsider. But wherl the
final came it was between Sayers and Barr, and the
outsider, taking charge, won easily by 31 to 14. He
was quite unknown to the Melbourne cognoscenti, and
that he should overthrow such a veteran as Barr was
looked upon as something miraculous. But it was
ever thus. It was a 15-year-old boy who slew Alp
Arslan in the middle of his armv, and a stripling
who laid out Richard the Lionheart. So Barr is not
alone in his downfall. Sayers proved himself to
be a master of the game, and at one head drove
three of Barr’s bowls out with one magnificent shot.
His drawing was also excellent and his trundling a
work of art.
Although it has lost the cricket ashes, the
Davis Cup, and the sculling and sundry bruising
championships, Australia still holds pride of place
at horse-steering. Frank Wootton is top-notch jockey
in England, Barney Oarslake is ditto in Austria, and
F. Bullock is the god of the pigskin in Germany.
Let us whoop '
What’s in a name? One of the best of
English footballers, playing against the South Afri-
cans in the Cold Country at present, is named
Muddiman. Kipling ought to feel flattered.
The Totalisator figures in South Aus. for
1912 show an increase from £532,000 the year
before, to £606,000, mostly on the city courses,
where the bookmaker’s raucous bellow is unheard.
Out of this money the Government got a handy
£15,000-odd; the clubs took 7i per cent., or
£45,000, which enabled them to ra'se stakes (en-
trance fees are already abnormally low) ; and the
public, after always getting a run for its money,
cut up a full 90 per cent, of what it had put in.
The Jockey Club (Eng.) has abolished
the races in which a weight allowance was given to
a mare’s first produce. It lately had to judge a
case in which the allowance was claimed for a
second foal, the first having been born dead. That
threatened to bring up other points—lf she “slips”
her first, does that count ? and so on —and it was
thought simpler to wipe out the system altogether.
A. J. Robson, last year’s N.S.W. Rhodes
Scholar, has already made good as a “wet-bob,” or
whatever weird thing it is the seekers after culchaw
at Oxford call a rowing man. In the final of the
College Fours, held at the end of October, Magdalen
beat Balliol by a length and a quarter, after a
splendid race. Robson stroked the Balliol crew.
Seeing that Magdalen’s four contained three of the
men who rowed for Leander in the Olympic contest
at Stockholm, it would have taken a mighty hot
college crew or a miracle to beat them. Robson only
left for Oxford last July, so the rowing powers-that
be got on to his track pretty slick —evidence of the
impression made by the rowing of the Australian
Eight at Henley and in Sweden.

Westralia showed inter-State riflemen
how to smash the bull’s optic at the Australian meet-
ing at Hobart. The whole Commonwealth was repre-
sented, and a strenuous tussle resulted in Westralia
scrambling through to the top with 1538 points.
Queensland was second with 1534, and N.S.W. third
with 1530. Tasmania and Vic. had 1513 and 1500
respectively, while South Aus. was nowhere with
1428.
Hydroplaning is not all beer and skittles.
Mr. Monk, of Manly (Sydney), trying his flier Rain-
bow, was last week skimming over the surface at
35 miles an hour. When he got into the jobbly
wash of a ferry, the boat leaped from one wave to
another, and apparently landed on a floating log.
Anyway, a great hole appeared in it, and as the
water rushed in, the hydroplane dived to the bottom,
leaving the crew struggling in the Harbor. However,
the craft was soon raised, and a new floor put in, and
it will race (d.v.) for the motor-boat championship
this Saturday. Which is quick work. Two other new
’planes from the same yard will compete.
One man and one woman who landed at
Glenelg from the Buffalo on December 28.
1836, were among the crowd that celebrated
S. Australia’s Anniversary Day in the same
place last week. It is thought!that about
four others still survive. The veteran James
Chittleborough, responding to Josiah
Symon’s eloquent toast of the Pioneers,
spent most of his time in deriding Glenelg’s
treasured relic, the Old Gumtree under
which Governor Hindmarsh (is said to
have) read his proclamation. The survivors
of to-day were naturally so small 76 years ago
that they were left on board ship for safety,
but he feels sure the big shady tree selected
was not a good three-quarters of a mile away
from the shore, like the present relic. If it
is a fraud, it has found quick and appro-
priate punishment, for it is dead and down,
and looks as if it had not sheltered any pic-
nic party within a century.
IN DEAD SILENCE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Play for the chess championship of Australia was
continued to-day. —Solemn announcement in the
morning paper.
This world is full of championships and contests full
of fire
That make the blood run hot and cold and force
folks to perspire;
The roaring grandstand rises up just like a tidal wave
When Prince Foote flashes from the field the wagered
gold to save ;
The sticks and hats are tossed aloft when Gregory
makes the catch
That sets the cables hard at work about the cricket
match ;
The soaring ball goes up ’midst yells, and mad sup-
porters fight,
Ere like a veil upon the field descends the wintry
night.
Wild human sounds that urge and goad most final
contests bless —
But no man dares to heave a sigh when two men
play at chess!
The Holder sits impassive as a statue of Ah Sin ;
The Challenger, in thought half-drowned, supports a
sinking chin ;
The “barrackers” like dumb ghosts stand behind a
length of rope,
And stare at the contending pair who for their pieces
grope;
Dreambound they sit through all the hours while
pilgrims come and go,
And ne’er a healthy blast of sound disturbs the
steady flow
Of that tremendous stream of thought that drives the
awful game ;
So ev’ry day is like the last, and ev’ry hour’s the
same.
I’d give a bit to see a youth explode that silence
grey,
By howling like a cannibal, “lIIP-HIP-HOO-
BLANKY-RAY ! ! !”

EXERCISE IS THE KEY OF HEALTH.
F
Your health and strength depend upon exercise.
Exercise is the judicious movement of the organs of the body
so that they will not become flabby through want of use.
When an organ becomes flabby it cannot carry out its
functions in a natural way. It goes from bad to worse.
Eventually it is a source of never-ending' annoyance—then
chronic ill-health.
JUDICIOUS EXERCISE IS THE KEY OF HEALTH.
Judicious exercise cuts out monotony, accomplishes permanent
results quickly, takes up very little time, and every movement
goes right to the spot.
The Baker Postal Course of Health and Strength Exer-
cises consists of exercises best suited to the individual.
It is the key of better health and greater strength. It’s bene-
hting hundreds throughout Australia and New Zealand. It’s
making them stronger and better men. Here’s one pupil’s
experience:- .
I feel much stronger and better in every way since
I started your course. I thank you most sincerely for
bringing me better health. I will always recommend your
postal course to my friends. —H.L.S., Warwick, Q.”
Make a New Year resolve to improve your physique and make
you a happier and better man by means of the Baker Postal
Instruction of Health and Strength Culture.

The ONLY Real Cure
Piles being caused by poisons in the blood, it is not reasonable
to attempt their cure by ointments or the sugeon’s knife. The
only real and permanent cure is to eradicate the harmful poisons
from the system. Murphy’s Pile Pills do this most effectively.
They promptly relieve the awful itching, heal the ulcers, and
brihg back perfect life to the deadened tissues, without any
inconvenience or unpleasantness.

Sir Charles A. Cameron, C. 8.,
M.D., etc.,
writes: “Takingan interest in all
subjects relating to food, I have
procured samples of Sanatogen
and subjected them to experi-
ment. . . .
“ In my opinion, it is the or-
ganic phosphorus which makes
Sanatogen of such value.
A series of experiments proved
that Sanatogen is easily and com-
pletely digested. I have arrived
at the conclusion that Sanatogen
is a substance of the highest
nutritive value, containing as it
does a large amount of organic
phosphorus—that is, phosphorus
which is offered to the tissues in
exactly the form in which it can
be easily absorbed. It is an ex-
cellent nerve food.’’
“The Medical Times”
says: ‘ ‘ There is no doubt what-
ever that the nutrition of patients
taking Sanatogen improves won-
derfully, due, in all probability,
to its being easy of assimilation
and to the organic absorbable
phosphorus which it contains.”
A thousand times this number of Physicians endorse
SANATOGEN
The Royal Tonic Food.
Over fourteen thousand practising physicians have recorded in writing their high
opinion of Sanatogen, and many thousands more are daily prescribing it with the
most beneficial results m cases of debility, brain fag, lack of vitality, sleepless-
ness, disordered digestion, poverty of blood and various wasting diseases.
Can you ask for more convincing testimony of Sanatogen’s value than the
act that it is thus publicly endorsed and recommended by practically the whole
medical profession ?
Among the original letters in praise of Sanatogen which are filed for public
inspection, there are many from world-famous physicians w 7 hose names stand
for the highest scientific achievements. 1 heir advice, and the example of
distinguished men like those mentioned here, it is safe for you to follow.
Irresistible as this evidence is, the reader can only realise the wonderful
revivifying effects of Sanatogen by taking it himself when his nervous system
and bodily strength have been undermined by overwork, worry or disease.
WRITE TO-DAY FOR FREE HEALTH BOOK.
You can buy Sanatogen at any chemists. Write to-day for a free copy of
Dr. Andrew Wilson’s health book, “The Art of Diving.’’ Please mention this
paper, and address your postcard to:
A. WULFING Si CO.
17 BOND STREET
SYDNEY.
Prof. Dr. C. A. Ewald,
of Berlin University, writes: “I
have used Sanatogen in a number
of cases, mainly of a nervous or
neurasthenic origin, and have
obtained excellent results.”
Mr. Hall Caine,
the celebrated Author and Dram-
atist, writes : “My experience
of Sanatogen has been that as a
tonic nerve food it has on more
than one occasion done me good. ’ ’
Mr. W. Rhodes,
the famous Yorkshire Cricketer,
writes : “I have given Sanatogen
a good trial, and found it a
splendid tonic.”
Mr. A. G. Hales,
the famous War-Correspondent:
‘‘l find my health benefits by
every tin of Sanatogen. It re-
vitalises a man, and is not a
drug.”

ments, pure, rich, sweet and realistic in its rendition of the human voice, and
in band and instrumental items.

ANTINEURASTHIN
TREATMENT OF
NERVOUS AND V/ASTING DISEASES.
The wonderful properties of Antineurasthin (Leci-
thin in an absolutely pure form) for successfully
treating all nerve maladies, Dyspepsia, Anaemia,
Rheumatism, etc., and imparting permanent mental
and nerve force, reflect the latest and most important
achievements in medical science.
One of tne most important of the wonderful re-
sults obtained by this treatment is that not alone
does it build up the nervous system by feeding the
brain and nerve-cells with their natural food ele-
ment, but on account of its beneficial action upon
the process of nutrition and upon the blood, the
whole general health shows prompt improvement,
particularly in wasting diseases.

classical. .. .M.G.: He’s a young man of 26 or so,

“L. 8.” on Smith :
In 1897 a gentleman named E. Pluribus Unum
Smith applied for a natent in Brisbane. The “Preserved
Smith” (B. 2/1 /’ 13) is beaten by Through-much-
Tribulation-We-enter-the-Kingdom-of-Heaven Smith,
who for some years drew a pension in Victoria. He
was known in the department as “Tribby.”
“K.M.” respecting the national vegetable:
“Lewis Crade’s” eulogy of the decorative value
of gum-trees (B. 2/1/T3) is right, but his othei
statements about the complete absence of the vege
table from Australian cities are too sweeping. He
should call in at Hobart and look at the splendid
gums in Macquarie-street. They have all the stately
height and decorative effect of poplars, without the
dirt and the conventional shape. Only a year or two ago
the deciduous trees in front of the Town Hal! were
removed to make room for gums—blue-leafed variety.
If, after he has seen these, he still seeks gums, let
him go out New Town way (same city), and look
it the magnificent specimens on the New Town-road,
particularly at the Friends’ school. Tall gums for
effect, and low, soreading deciduous trees for shade,
as in Macquarie-street, outside Franklin-square, make
a perfect combination. But anything rather than the
hearse-like Moreton Bay fig! .
A book of reminiscences written by
Colonel Chaille-Long, and just published,
will certainly have to be brought under the
notice of the British War Office or Board of
Health or the hangman or somebody. Chaille-
Long was Gordon’s Chief-of-Staff in Egypt,
when the Christian soldier was in that
region, and, according to his yarn, the boss
was almost as fond of the open bottle as he
was of the Open Bible. Here is a character-
istic bit describing an attack on the camp :• —-
Gordon was in his hut, and gave no sign of coming
out. It was during one of the oft-recurring periods
when he shut himself up, and placed a hatchet and
flag at the door as a sign that he was not to be
disturbed, a seclusion that sometimes lasted from
three to five days. I sent an officer to him to warn him
of our danger, but, receiving no reply, went myself.
I entered abruptly, and found him seated very
calmly at a table, on which were an open Bible and
a bottle of cognac and sherry. I told him of the
situation, to which he made abrupt answer, “You
are commander of the camp.” Whereupon I hastily
turned and left him, but not before I had posted an
officer with half-dozen men specially charged with
Gordon’s safety.
The colonel also has much to say of Gor-
don’s frequent outbursts of unrestrained
passion. “I cannot live peaceably with any-
one whom I cannot kick,” the eminent
Christian on one occasion observed. His
valet, Gessi, was struck and kicked when-
ever Gordon felt that way inclined ; which was
so often that at last the valet left, and went
in search of a boss who didn’t carry a Bible
in his knapsack. From all the statues of
Gordon the bottle has been conspicuously
absent thusfar.

It is not difficult to know when a mild aperient
is required. One feels dull and depressed; there is
I acid in the stomach, oppression at the chest, numb
pain in the back, possibly a sharp attack of indigestion
or biliousness and headache.
Cockle’s Pills quickly dispel all such distressing symptoms of disorder,
cleansing the system thoroughly, restoring tone and stability to the whole
digestive apparatus, purifying the blood, and generally renewing normal
physical conditions as well as mental brightness. In a word, Cockle s Pills
brighten existence by keeping the body fit and well. The purer skin

BLOTCHES COVERED
KECK MB FACE
Spread Rapidly. Large, Red and
Very Irritating, After Using
Cuticura Soap and Ointment a
Couple of Weeks Trouble Died
Away Completely.
7 Hardy St., East Brunswick, Vic.—
“ Some months ago I began to feel a small
red spot on the side of my neck, which
spread rapidly till it cov-
ered my neck and face with
large red blotches and was
very irritating. I tried sev-
eral ointments and bathing
it but they did no good.
Then I tried various other
treatments recommended to
me but it seemed not a bit
the better. I then noticed
the free sample advertisement of Cuticura
Ointment in a weekly paper and I applied
and got same. After using the sample I
seemed to feel much easier so I procured
a box of Cuticura Ointment and a cake of
Cuticura Soap and after using them for a
couple of weeks I am glad to say the trouble
died away completely and I have had no
return of it since. My mother was so pleased
with my cure that she gets the Cuticura
Ointment for any sores that any of the fam-
ily get.” (Signed) Donald Smith, March
1912.
Not only are Cuticura Soap and Ointment
most valuable in tho treatment of eczemas
and other distressing eruptions of skin and
scalp, but no other emollients do so much
for pimples, blackheads, red, rough skins,
itching, scaly scalps, dandruff and dry, thin
and falling hair, chapped hands and shape-
less nails. Cuticura Soap and Ointment are
sold throughout the world. For sample of

An Interesting-
Experiment.
If you would like to see the alteration Grey
Hairs make, just lay a piece of paper over each of
the two halves of the above portrait. The Grey
“half” will then be seen to have the appearance
of 45 years of age, whereas the other half looks
only 30. Dr. B. Allen’s (U.S.A.) Mexican Walnut
Stain will make all those years of difference if you
are grey or prematurely grey. It is perfectly
harmless, easy to apply, and will quickly restore
the hair to the natural shade of youth, or younger
years.

A Simple, Safe and Reliable Way that Produces Surprising Results
NEW PREPARATION CAUSES BIG STIR AMONG HAIR SPECIALISTS
The above clearly shows Results from a Short Course of my I rue Hair-Growing Compound.
10,000 FREE TRIAL BOXES.
Those who are troubled with falling hair, dandrufl,
baldness, itching scalp, etc., know full well the
humiliation that they cause. There is no need, how-
ever, of such conditions. These troubles can be
quickly overcome by my True Hair Grower.
I am not an advertising quack, but am a business
man. My hair began to grow thin about the time
I reached the age of thirty. When I had reached the
age of thirty-five the top of my head was quite bald.
I had considerable pride, and sought for something
to cause renewed growth. I invested in every pre-
paration that I could see or hear of, and here let me
say that not only did I try all the English so-called
restorers, but those of Continental Europe. I also
visited specialists. My experimenting cost me many
sovereigns and considerable time —yet the hairs came
not. I had given up the idea of ever growing hair
again. One afternoon, while enjoying a brief busi-
ness respite bv an Alpine trip, I fell in with an old
collegiate chemist, whose hair was particularly plen-
tiful. I jokingly remarked that I wished he could
spare some of his hair for my benefit. This lead him
to tell me that he understood the human hair as well
as a good dentist understands teeth. He wrote out a
formula, and suggested that I have a quantity of the
compound prepared. I did this a few clays later. [
was astonished to see the hair coming forth after
several applications, and within six weeks my head
was covered by a firm, yet soft, black growth of hair.
Since then the hair on my head has been as luxuriant
as when in my school days. Having arranged for
the legal right to do so, I have for some time been
privately selling this marvellous hair-growing com-
pound. I hold over one thousand letters from people
who have actually grown new hair through the
medium of mv true hair grower. I do not pretend
to say it is the only hair grower in the world —I am
not interested in decrying others —but I do assert
that it is the most reliable, and in the end by far the
cheapest.

Business, Bobbery, etc.
The first pub in Melbourne at which whisky was
obtainable was the William Tell, kept by Thomas
Halfpenny, in 1839. J. B. Were arrived at that
time, bringing with jiim merchandise for sale.
Amongst the lines was a quantity of whisky—a
liquor theretofore unknown on the Yarra. Halfpenny
laid-in a couple of puncheons, and sold it at a bob
a nob. But it did not catch the public palate; and
good old rum died hard.
Some feeble-minded people who are afflicted with
the “importing” disease, have been asking Premier
AVatt to introduce a few pints of Carposina adrep-
tella. Carpo is, it appears, a beetle, moth or bug
which knocks out that other imported pest, the black-
berry, and the notion is that the beast would save the
lazy landowner considerable toil. Besides, Carpo
wouldn’t want wages like a coarse laborer with a bill-
hook. However, per contra, the learned entomologist
French, being asked for expert opinion, coldly stated
that Carpo was first cousin to Codlinalso that,
besides blackberries, it had a deadly animus against
strawberries, raspberries and similar small fruits, for
which reasons, unless Mr. Watt wished to see more
capital leaving the country hurriedly, the pest had
better be kept as far distant as possible.

“Moutere”: Regarding those two little tables the
Governor-General’s wife wanted to rgmind her of all
the loyal linen drapers and others who wept such
loud tears over her departure. It is almost a miracle
that J. McGowen didn’t send an urgent wire in reply,
telling the lady that she could have the articles and
the hearthrug and coal-scuttle as well. As he didn’t,
and as the furniture in question is supposed to be
worth several millions sterling, or some other sum,
and as McGowen is hard up for cash to finance the
things that don’t greatly want financing, and has no
cash at all to spend on the things that are really
wanted, and as the chances of the Labor party being
re-elected would be greatly increased by the expendi-
ture of a lot of money that didn’t cost anything to
get, I hereby move that the two pieces of priceless
furniture be sold, and the numerous millions thus ob-
tained devoted to public works. Personally, I am of
opinion that N.S.AV. can’t afford to keep absolutely
priceless things for which it has no use. Also, with
wars and revolutions and all sorts of things hanging
in the cloudy future, the market price of the price-
less articles might suddenly drop, or the Hon. Bill
Bikes might break through and steal, or a fire might
be started, or any old thing might happen. If I
had any priceless things of the sort about I’d be pre-
pared to take the biggest sum I could get for them
on account, and the undefined balance in weekly in-
stalments in perpetuity. But, alas, some priceless
articles sell for 505., or thereabouts, when you
actually try to realise on them.

Bill Sikes reviews his latest job: I finds biz easy
at a crib at Malvern East (Vic.) last week. A lydy
went out an’ locks all the doors and windows and
puts the key under a rock in th’ yard. Then she
remembers that th’ ol’ man might come ’ome, an’
findin’ th’ 'ouse locked up, think she ’ad absconded
with th’ rent, so she pins a note on the door sayin’
the key is under the stone. What ho! says I, and
gets busy. When I ’ad borrowed ’er jewellery and th’
cash, I locks up agen and puts the key back ; but
if she ever does it agen, I would be much obliged if
she would make it like this: “The key is under the
same rock, and my jewellery is in the top' drawer;
the cash is under my pillar.” It wouldn’t be so ’ard
on my nerves.

The almost unprecedented price of poultry in Ade-
laide markets this Christmas is attributed to the
ravages of foxes in the outer suburbs. The smelly
animal raids the roosts regularly, and finds complete
cover in the neighboring hills. The local Hunt Club
will have to discard aniseed rags and justify its
existence.
Another morsel of the Dan Cooper Estate, in Syd-
ney, was offered at auction the other day—the offices
of the T. and C. Journal and Evening News, in
Market-street. The highest bid was £39,500,
which the owners would not accept, notwithstanding
land tax and absentee super-tax.

Judging by the number of ptomaines raging and
getting in effective work, the time is ripe for the
Australian Government to put both feet on the
tinned infection. State action is frequently of no
avail. AVhen the N.S.W. Government proposed to in-
sist upon the Yankee salmon conforming to the
local Pure Foods law, the Yankee exporters calmlv
intimated that if the salmon was “interfered with,”
none would be sent to N. S. AVales. Whereupon, Ma
backed down. The Yankees could afford to do with-
out the trade of N.S.W. ; but they would have thought
twice before throwing away the trade of all Aus-
tralia.

The cable mentions that two female cashiers of
the Helsingfors Bank, from which the manager
scooped out some fabulous amount, have wept on the
Law’s cold shoulder and confessed that they knew
he was embezzling all the time. There is a beauti-
ful Yankee theory that the woman-clerk is all 20-
carat honesty, because she rarely drinks or gambles,
or has a high old time. The Helsingfors case re-
minds us that she is always liable, though, to suc-
cumb to admiration for the person or talents of her
boss —the little tin god of the machine she knows.

“Yannatherra”: I hereby declare Bill to be Aus-

railway guard when he is working, but he does
things in his spare time. He owns one-third of an
acre of this continent, at Ararat (Vic.). On that
cart-load of earth Bill has grown a comfortable
dwelling for a small family of Billikins. In the
vacant spaces he has growing wheat, oats, barley,
maize, lucerne (two plots), rape, rye grass, mangoes,
cabbages, cauliflowers, carrots, parsnips, turnips,
lettuce, onions, spuds (three varieties), pumpkins,
marrows, tomatoes, beans (French, Dutch and scarlet
runners), peas (two varieties), beet, gooseberries,
apples, plums, peaches, apricots, parsley, thyme and
sage. He also decorates the place with a cow and
some fowls. These items I can swear to, and I’m
not sure that he hasn’t others. He’s a tired Aus-
tralian is Bill.

Below we give a few (greatly condensed) extracts from unsolicited testimonials from buyers of
Beale High-grade Pianos.
NEW SOUTH WALES.
Mr. F. OWEN, jun., Hon. Sec. School of Arts,
Tuena: —
“Piano has given every satisfaction. People com-
petent to judge say it is the best instrument in the
district.”
Mrs. J. A. SWAIN, Kilphysic, Oaroll:
“Has tood the changeable seasons remarkably well.
We are all very pleased with it.”
Mr. G. JONES, Canterbury:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction. No hesitation
in recommending the Beale to anyone as the finest
piano procurable.”
Mr. E. E. VIDLER, Morisset: —
“Piano is in perfect order, notwithstanding the
fact that it has been in constant use.”
Mrs. ELLEN KILLEEN, Wolfram Street, Broken
Hill: —
“Has given every satisfaction. Tone is rich and
full: instrument has stood the Broken Hill climate
wonderfully ; better than any other piano that I know
of. Would recommend the Beale Piano to anyone who
wants a real good piano.”
Mrs. JOAN MASSIE, 44 Hunter Street, Newcastle:—
“The tone exceeds my expectations, being wonder-
fully mellow, while the external finish is very hand-
some. Several professionals have expressed their ad-
miration.”
Mrs. C. JENNINGS, Blende Street, Broken Hill:—
“Better to-dav than when it was supplied to me
five years ago, and we have had some very severe
weather since then. The tone improves with use.
Can recommend the Beale Piano to anyone requir-
ing a first-class piano for tone, touch and dura-
bility.”
Mrs. F. RUDDOCK, Waimea, Walgett Street, Ka-
toomba
“Highly delighted with it.”
Mr. J. SLATER, Killarney, East Moree: —
“Wish to express my fullest satisfaction in every
way with the instrument.”
Mr. J. HOGG, Lithgow
“Piano has given perfect satisfaction.”
Mr. CHARLES R. RAYNER, Sec. Oddfellows’ Lodge,
Casino:—
“Piano has given every satisfaction.”
Mr. A. GREEN, Burwood Street Junction, New-
castle :—•
“The time that it will remain in tune is wonder
ful. I have had English and foreign pianos, but they
never remained in tune a quarter of the time, nor
came near the Beale for tone.”
Mrs. W. O’HARA, Wyalong:—
“More than pleased with my piano. Everyone who
has heard it admires its beautiful tone.”
Miss A. M. RUDDER, Kempsey:—
“Have no hesitation in saying that it would be
impossible to get a more satisfactory instrument
from every standpoint. Its tone is to-day as soft
and brilliant, and its appearance as handsome as
the day it was bought.”
Mrs. C. C. GRAHAM, Temoin Street, Trangie:—
“Very pleased with Beale Piano. Always ready
to recommend your pianos to anyone requiring a
first-class instrument.”

piano you sent me. Tone is very rich.”

Mortlake: —
“Piano is a ‘gem.’ lias given every satisfaction.”
QUEENSLAND.
Mrs. M. McKINNON, 357 Bolsover Street, Rock-
hampton :
“Piano is perfect. A friend of mine who
prejudiced against the Beale Piano, decided to get
one when she heard mine.”
Mr. A. R. ROBINSON, Sec. People's Progressive
League, Adelaide Street, Brisbane: —•
“Piano is giving great satisfaction. Many have
expressed their surprise at such a high-grade instru-
ment being manufactured in Australia.
Mrs. M. WARD, Mount Perry, via Bundaberg:—
“We are all very well satisfied with the piano.
Tone is excellent.”

Mr. J. H. ROGERS, Woolocot Street, Coburg:—
“Must say that everyone who has been to my
place has nothing but praise for the piano.”
SOUTH AUSTRALIA.
Mr. H. J. ARMITAGE, Public School, Houghton:—
“Piano, which I have had for three years, has been
in constant use, and tone is as good as when I got
it. Pianists often remark on its great purity of
tone.”
Mrs. H. WALKER, Wandilo, Mount Gambier: —
“Must express my satisfaction with your beauti-
ful, sweet-toned instrument.”
Mrs. 0. EVERETT, Renmark: —
“Much appreciated by all who play it.”
WESTERN AUSTRALIA.
Mr. G. A. BEECK, Katanning:—
“Self and family are more than pleased with the
Beale High-grade Piano.”
Mr. J. A. MILLS, York:—
“Quite satisfied with piano in every way.”
Mrs. C. POWELL, Linden Villa, Stirling Street,
Perth:—
“There is not a better instrument in Perth.”
Mr. T. WARD, Wagin, Western Australia: —
“Greatly satisfied in every respect.”
Mr. W. H. BROWN, Kalgoorlie:—
“Very pleased with the instrument. Much better
than I expected.”
TASMANIA.
Mr. AV. K. DRAKE, Westburg:—
“Piano has given entire satisfaction. Have had
it two years, and it has not yet needed tuning.”
Mr. HENRY NEWTON, Launceston:—
“As good as the day I bought it. Can safely re-
commend to anyone. Good pianists have pronounced
it to be a first-class instrument. Touch and tone
are perfect.”
The above are just a few of the many testimonials that we are continually receiving
from users of Beale High-Grade Pianos. .
Such success has only been obtained through our unwearying efforts to produce an
instrument of the best quality. That we have succeeded is proved by the opinions of
those who should know best —the users of our pianos.
To obtain this quality we have invented patent methods of construction which render
our piapos more durable, while retaining and enhancing all the musical qualities of the
great makes of the Old World. The use of an iron wrest-plank which is pait of oui
patent steel tuning-system —is as great an improvement in the art of piano manufacture
as was the superseding of the old wooden-frame by the iron-frame which is used in all
modern pianos. In addition, we have introduced many other improvements, such as our
method of building up the casework from cross-plies of wood which is all thoroughly
seasoned here, and hence fit to withstand Australian climatic conditions much better than
timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate of Europe. In order to g't the l ' est > ,f v ’
artisans, we pay higher wages than those awarded by theVV ages Boards in the va o
trades. We naturally get the best artisans, and thus the best of skill. \\e use only the
finest of materials.
We realise that an Australian-made piano is subjected to much closer scrutiny in
Australia than any imported piano, and therefore we make—we .are compelled to make —
our pianos much better than those of our competitors. But then, by making pianos in
Australia we are in a position to make them much better suited to Australian conditions.
Any competent cabinet-maker will tell you that timber seasoned in the cold, damp climate
of Europe cannot be expected to withstand Australian conditions of dry heat as well as
timber which is seasoned in this climate. This is a most important point in piano-
making, and is one good reason why so many foreign pianos develop cracked sounding-
boards, split tuning-systems and faulty casework soon after arrival in this country. But
no man can say that he ever saw a Beale piano with a cracked sounding-board. We
absolutely guarantee that the sounding-boards of the Beale Pianos will never crack in any
climate, because our special system of construction renders cracking an impossibility, at
the same time that it greatly enhances the tonal qualities of the instrument. Beale
pianos contain the only practical steel tuning-system in the world—so there can be no
question of splitting of the wrest-plank. And then our patented system of cross-plied
woodwork ensures permanence of the outside case of the pianos.
Be sure of this: the better musician you are, the more you will delight in a Beale High-grade Piano.
We have always on hand a number of good second-hand pianos, taken in part payment of
Beale Pianos.
Call and inspect the Beale Pianos now. Inspection does not put you under any obligation
whatever. " You suit yourself entirely as to whether you purchase.
If you cannot call, write for Catalogue, which we will be glad to send post free. We sell for
cash or on easiest terms. =====

The keen farmer judges by results
Here is a
Proposition
TheMELOTTE
Separator is
placed on the
market at a cost
slightly above
that of the
average cream
separator.
The
Result
The Melotte
has the largest
sale in the
British Empire,
and an annually
increasing one.
The
Conclusion
If the price
is above the
average, the de-
sign, materials,
workmanship,
and construc-
tion, must be
incalculably
above the aver-
age; otherwise
this enormous
sale would be
impossible.
The
Secret
lies in the fact that
once installed,
the Melotte
produces an
increased yield
of the best

throughout a
lifetime of con-
stant use with
practically no
further outlay

“Politicus”: While Governor Macgregor
(and other Scots) are belauding Scottish
patriotism (and kilts), it might be noted
that Cabinet Minister John Burns gave evi-
dence lately before a Royal Commission to
the effect that 1912 would be the first time
for a hundred years that emigration from
Scotland had exceeded the' natural increase.
Is there really much patriotism about the
man who forsakes his own fatherland for
another fellow’s?
“Politicus”: Went hunting up Christmas
toys in the Brisbane shops, and was stag-
gered to find I could only procure articles
made in Germany. Santa Claus proved by
subsequent evidence to have been in the same
predicament. I remembered then that
“Dagonet” Sims declared, in London
Referee, that a patriotic woman who in-
sisted (in 1910) on buying a .doll and a
Noah’s Ark of English make went all over
London without being able to get either.
Germany and Switzerland have collared the
English trade. From local experience I
judge they have also collared the Australian
trade. We offer J. Bull a tariff preference,
and even then he can’t compete with his
Protectionist rivals.
Bananaland, on whose doorstep sits the
wet ghost of the Yongala, does not seem to
care much how many obstacles its shipping
has to dodge. The Urilla stranded off Cape
Conway last winter, and the Marine Court
adjourned the inquiry to enable the State
authorities to survey the spot and make
dead certain that the chart was not wrong
as usual. The State authorities yawned a
reply to the effect that, they had no boat avail-
able. So Admiral King-Hall was appealed
to, and, although the matter was no concern
of his, he. sent the little Sealark up. This
survey ship found that the chart was the
usual . murderous liar, Ripple Rock, the
Urilla’s obstacle, being further north than
charted, and having close handy a sort of
sub-murderer who only peeped above the
water when the tide was low. The Sea-
lark’s evidence saved the Urilla captain’s
ticket; but there should be some sort of hard
official kick coming to some body. Apart
from the ordinary humanitarian "aspect of
the case, it is bad business for a State that
bids high for the tourist to leave these tidv-
ing-up jobs; undone. People won’t go holi-
daying on ejrfcn the bluest of seas if they
have an idea those seas are full of incor-
rectly-charted dangers.
°th er day, at Coorparoo, William
. ryai, tor many years Queensland’s senior
inspector of mines. In his 60 years of Aus-
tralian ufe, Fryar had played many parts,
mostly in Bananaland—had been success-
ively coal-miner, surveyor, member of Par-
liament, Minister for Lands, and inspector
of mines. The accursed climate finally got
him down at the age of 85.
The Brisbane dailies scarify Justice Hig-
gins for having alluded to the local Tram-
ways concern as “an English company with
an American manager,” and wmnt to know
what bearing that has on the case. It has
j e . as t this bearing—English companies
and American bosses do not understand the
drift of Australian unionism, the conditions
and inevitable tendencies of Australian
labor, or the workings of our Arbitration
tribunals. And this ignorance is the parent
of many a misunderstanding.
Premier Denham, commenting on Philp’s
recent remarks concerning Australian ex-
travagance, said that the sin was certainly
rife in Australia. For example, he said, he
“knew a mechanic who, a few years ago,
earned oOs. a week, and supported thereon a
wife and five children. The family is now
grown up, and the income of that household is
£lO a week, yet the head of that family saves
nothing. Why don’t these people put by
something for a rainy day?” In a certain
country called Queensland, the revenue is
enormously larger than it was six years ago,
but so outrageous has been the increase in
expenditure that one little year of drought
will land the State in the soup. Moreover, the
fund that might stave off trouble on a “rainy
day to wit, the loan fund —has been used
to foster a boom instead of being kept in
reserve. And of the two men who have been
most responsible for this shameful policy,
the name of one is Philp and of the other
Denham.
BANGER,
“'Tain't safe to be dossin ’ ’ere, Willred. They might mistake us for somethink else."
The Liberals look on the Lilley seat in the
Reps, as a walk-over; hence there are seven
patriots scrambling for plebiscite selection.
Stumrn and Hamilton, ex-State members;
Foxton, the six-and-eightpenny Colonel who
thought Australia didn’t want a navy of its
own; and ex-Laborite Tom Glassey are
amongst the number. But Lilley, son of the
late Chief Justice, after whom the electorate
is named, is standing in the Labor interest;
and, being the biggest Australian of the lot,
he will get the vote of every Nationalist worth
while—and there are a lot-of them in Gym-
pie and the mining towns thereabouts.
On January 1 Bananaland’s public ser-
vants, except the railway workers and a few
others, commenced to contribute to a Super-
annuation Fund. Registrar of Friendly
Societies Rendle thought out the scheme.
Public servants under 30 must insure; over
30 it is optional. Each takes one unit of
death assurance, another of incapacity assur-
ance. and a third of annuity. The annuity
is £5O per annum after 65. If an assured
person dies before 65, his annuity payments
are returned. To help the thing along, an
annual charge of £5OOO is made on the con-
solidated revenue to meet the expenses. This
is Bananaland’s third attempt at such a
scheme. The others occurred in the ’6o’s
and ’Bo’s, and were withdrawn after proving
failures. That isn’t an encouraging record ;
but the framers of the scheme believe they
know the pitfalls now.
Culture and Cow.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A young man of gentlemanly appearance and man-
ners wants a situation on a dairy farm.
—Brisbane Courier advt.
Not with the manners brusque and Ungers
corny
Of old-time yokels comes our helper now :
Not he the wight to lay a hand that’s horny
Upon the sacred teats of Madame Cow;
His accents show him blent of all politeness,
His palms are soft and of a pearly white-
ness. *
He takes his pail with “Bv vour leave, mv
lady,”
And plants himself beside her with a
grace
That fairly staggers honest Farmer Brady,
And lends a cultured air to all the place ;
And when he frees the milker from her
labors
His bow brings forth the boss’s “Well, be
jabers!”
He doth not prod the cumbrous, bovine body
Of Dinah and consign her soul to —well,"
We’ll not say where, nor doth he scare the
poddy
With gruesome oath and fierce bucolic
yell;
He’s sweet to all below and all above him,
And ev’ry cow’s constrained, of course, to
love him.
With air genteel and manner almost stately,
He takes a seat by grizzled Dad and Mum,
And if the flapjacks do not please him
greatly,
His breeding bids his plaintive soul “Be
dumb!”
And though his hosts a trifle rough and
raw be,
They both confess his style is “worth the
bawbee.”
Gone are the savage days when rustic rough-
ness
Was all the mode in Brady’s milking
yard ;
No place there now for grievous oath and
gruffness.
And ribald gibe and jest are all debarred ;
’Tis: “Please, kind sir,” and “Pardon, Mis-
tress Mary,”
From morn to night at present in our dairy.
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER. F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, January 4, 1913.
My Dear Thargomindaii,—
Her Excellency Macgregor, who is at
present in London, as the guest of one
daughter and chaperone of the other, will
get back to this hamlet early in March. In
the meantime, the head of the family con-
tinues his strenuous odd jobs. He came
back from a trip to Bundaberg yesterday,
and already is contemplating another excur-
sion. After that I suppose he’ll have a
holiday.
Archbishop Donaldson has decided to take
a spell and go for a trip south. With his
sister, Mrs. Lawley, and the rev. person
whose name she wears, the cheery prelate
will depart next week for N. S. Wales, and,
after a few days in Sydney, will set the
episcopal legs to climb Kosciusko. The
Lawleys have just returned from Asia, and,
after the Kosciusko jaunt, will set their
faces towards England.
Premier Denham has made up his mind
to flee for a brief time from the wrangles
of the Inner Circle in March. He will
head for the Gulf country, passing through
Rockhampton, Longreach, Winton, Clon-
curry, Normanton and Croydon, thence
back to face the wrath to come —if it knows
its business. The trip will last a month.
Justice Lukin is spending the best part
of the long vacation in Maoriland, and took
the opportunity the other day to drop into
Wellington and pay his respects to his
uncle, Gresley Lukin, who is editor of the
local Evening Post, and Maoriland’s most
popular journalist. The old gentleman is
still well remembered in Queensland, where
he sat in the editorial chair of the Brisbane
Courier in the ’7o’s.
One of Brisbane’s best-known medical
men. Dr. Hardie, has been brought to book
m the New Year’s list of honors. George
v. made him a K. 8., which, so a man who
ought to know tells me, means Kingly
Balderdash. However, Dr. Hardie has a
big practice, and the new helping of
alphabet is not likely to interfere with the
more important one of M.D.
"Charley’s Aunt” was dragged from her
long resting place and lured before the foot-
lights on New Year’s Night, by the Cremer-
\\ orger co. The most noticeable feature of
the production was that Brandon Gremer,
who played “Babs,” was almost Jack Can-
not’s double. Even to the little, barely-
noticeable stutter, these two are alike, and
Cannot’s Dame and Cremer’s Donna Lucia
were practically the same lady in a different
hat.
The drowning fatality at Southport last
Saturday drove many holiday-makers away
from that place. The three boys who lost
their lives were all well known in sporting
circles here, and all were very popular.
Stanley Chapman and "Billy” Wilson were
old Grammar School boys, and had played
football in the colors, both as past and
present scholars. Arthur Brookes was a
University boy, and a member of the New
Farm tennis team. All the lads were under
The sadness caused by the loss of these
three promising youths is somewhat light-
ened by the heroism displayed by several of
the others who were on the spot. It was
due to the efforts of “Bob” Willcocks (cap-
tain of the Grammar School football team),
“Huck”Lahey and Noel Robertson, that more
lives were not lost. Willcocks saved Alice
Hobbs. Noel Robertson, after bringing in
Miss McNish, went back and swam by
Lottie Bond for 20 minutes. This girl
with one arm useless from the sting of a
Portuguese man-of-war. showed a courage
that was marvellous. She sent both Lahey
and Robertson to help the others, and re-
peatedly urged the boys to leave her
Finally, she was brought to the beach by her
father. In keeping with the usual practice
of mending the fence after manv of the
sheep have gone, a reel and life line will
now probably be placed on the main beach.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTBALIA JANE.
RAYMOND, MAYOR OF BRISBANE.
The quaint drinking customs attached to
Brisbane Christmases have in the past ex-
cited the wonder of strangers. Under the
old Liquor Acts you might buy your bottle
of beer on Christmas Day, but you dared not
consume it on licensed premises. The result
was that Bill the Boozer purchased his long-
sleever at the bar and consumed jt on the
pavement. Queen-street was, consequently,
for the day tesselated with drunks. Under
the new Act this asinine business has come
to an end.
It was said in a cocksure fashion a while
back that Andrew Fisher would be unseated
for Wide Bay at the coming election.
Colonel Rankin, a big cane grower in the
electorate, was whooped up as the man to
beat him; but, after looking round, he reck-
oned his “brownie” was a sinker, and
withdrew. But that has not prevented a
mob of political deadbeats pushing in where
Rankin feared to tread. Hodge, State mem-
ber for Nanango; Bartholomew, who was
recently ousted from the Maryborough seat;
and Weinholt, sitting State member for
Fassifern, are all out for selection. Wein-
holt is the only one of the lot who would
have a ghost of a chance ; but it is a poor,
wobbly sort of a ghost at best.
“Don Q.,” about a flourishing curse:—
Few people even yet realise what an appalling
proposition Queensland is up against when it faces
its prickly-pear pest. The evidence given in a recent
court case, in Rockhampton, throws some light upon
the cost of eradication. The North Rockhampton
Council sued a land owner to recover the cost of re-
moving the weed from a piece of his land—£lo fora
38-perch allotment. In his evidence, the town clerk
admitted that some of the streets could not be found
at all, having been lost in a jungle of pear. But to
see pear which is pear, one has to visit the Gayndah
district. For 20- or 30-odd miles one can pick a
way through avenues of it 20ft. and more high. The
shire councils there have to fight for their lives to
keep the roads open. It isn’t enough to throw the
onus of clearing pear from private lands upon local
bodies. Drastic laws, fixing steep minimum penalties
upon any land owner in possession of a pear patch,
is the only safe method. The present system is a
rotten one. I can let my patch of pear spread all
over the place. If the municipal staff comes along
and clears it off, the council can collect onlv the
actual cost from me. If I had to meet a £lOO fine
as well, or had to part up three times the actual
cost of the clearing, I wouldn’t sit down and wait
for the council’s staff to come. I’d get a hustle on
and go out and belt that pear good and hard

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, von will be glad to
hear of a simple and scientific device which restores
hearing, no matter how old you are. No mystery or
secrecy about it; we describe it fully, and explain
just how it acts. You use spectacles as sight magni-
fiers, and in the same way you use this sound magni-
fier to hear better. Unlike spectacles, the Wilson
Common-sense Ear-Drums are invisible and comfort-
able. No one can tell you are wearing them. They
rest the ear nerves by taking the strain off them—the
strain of trying to hear indistinct sounds. What a
relief to have done with that tiring strain. Being
made of the softest I’ara rubber they cannot be felt,
even when the head rests on a pillow. For the same
reason, a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. They protect the tender inner parts of the
ear, that are so sensitive, from cold winds, dust, sud-
Uen and piercing sounds.
So that yon may clearly understand how the Sound
Magnifiers "estore hearing, we give. an illustration of
one as it lies in the ear. You will notice that the
Sound Magnifier is shaped like a trumpet, and so con-
veys even the faintest sounds right to the natural drum.
Being of the softest rubber, it cannot hurt the ear.
It fits the orifice of the ear
with precision and comfort.
The division that runs
across the mouth is to al-
low the removal and inser-
tion of the Ear-Drum, and
to brace it.
The shape of the Wilson
Ear-Drum has been chosen
after years of experience as
the best adapt-
ed to carry the
faintest sound.
Of course, if
you have lost
the h e a r i ng-
nerve co m-
pletely, or were
born deaf, we
cannot pretend
io cure you. Only a miracle could
do that, in spite of some of the
absurd claims made to-day. But
of you can hear the faintest sound,
do not despair. You will never
regret trying the Wilson Ear-
Drums. We have letters to show
'on from deaf people in Australia
and New Zealand, who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may wear
the Ear-Drums day and night, and take them out
whenever you wish. Children can wear them (we
have special sizes for children from six to twelve).
liven a child can insert and remove them without the
least danger.
The price is £1 (the fee for a doctor’s single
visit). This includes a pa : r of drums (they are only
sold in pairs), a fine nickel remover, and also an
inserter. After the first pair is bought you may pur-
chase a single drum at any time for Bs., but the
pair yon get at first will last quite two years. Do
not ask for a trial pair. We Ho not send' them out
on trial, and so they are never secondhand. Use the
Order form below, and the Outfit will be sent you
at once, with the fullest instructions. Don’t delay,
but have the comfort of good hearing as soon as von
can.

KODAKS are
Masterpiece Cameras.
are perfect picture-makers, being made in a factory where inferi-
-1 onty or faultiness is impossible. They combine simplicity with relia-
bility, compactness with convenience, and quality with smallness of cost.
Kodak simplicity is a wonderful thing—it renders the dark room unneces-
sary, makes photography a genuine pastime instead of a laborsome drudge
and makes the securing of good pictures a hundred per cent, surer and easier
than by old-time dark-room and glass-plate methods.

t
bile BEANS purify the blood—regulate and tone the
SYSTEM, AND RESTORE HEALTH.
THE following: case of Mrs. V. Swarbrick,
of 181 Denison Street, Camperdown,
Sydney, is typical of the suffering
thousands of women undergo. Close con-
finement indoors, and the worries of the
home, have the effect of disorganising and
weakening the system, and making it an
easy prey for all manner of disorders and
derangements. Mrs. Swarbrick graphically
describes her suffering, and tells how—
AFTER AEE OTHER REMEDIES
PROVED ABSOLUTELY USELESS—BiIe
Beans restored her to perfect health and
strength.
“Liver disorder reduced me to a terrible
state,” says Mrs. Swarbrick, “and I became
thin, languid, and worn out. Bouts of
biliousness troubled me. and at times
everything would seem to go black before
my eyes, and I would almost go blind. At
other times spots appeared to be floating
about, and dizziness made me so bad that
I could hardly stand. My appetite left me

It is my belief the greatest moral mischief is done
by reason of this disregard of the habits and charac-
ters of those with whom we associate. Take everv
care in selecting your friends, even your associates
— Melb. sermon.
WE’RE all God’s creatures, it is true ;
But pick your brothers carefully,
And, oh, regard your sister new
With grave suspicion, till you see
She’s everything she ought to be.
The Devil sends with fiendish guile
Fair seeming ones our souls to taint.
Then hold each fellow creature vile
Who has not shown himself a saint.
Abjure the child of empty mirth,
The worldly ones who laugh and thrive !
There is upon this wicked earth
One task alone of any worth,
It is to save your soul alive.
The Church is an exclusive pen
Where lambs are safe from noon to
noon.
Avoid the wicked race of men,
And you may join the angels soon.
They’re i ittle better held than Cain,
Who for a worldly boon oppress
And treat their brethren with disdain;
\V ho does for other-worldly gain
An image is of saintliness.
So keep your high dividing fence
Well spiked and in the best repair,
F °r “ ] ove your neighbor” isn’t sense—
Of man-traps saints must all beware!

The Discomfiture of Councillor
Bangs.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IT was late in the day, and the men en-
gaged in pulling down “The Willows”
looked like clumsy spectres with their
white coating of cement and lime dust. The
razing of the old house was an event locally.
Curious loiterers gathered as near as the fall-
ing brickbats and tumbling iron would allow,
and traffic had to make a detour. The trams
stopped short at the hoarding of galvanised
iron, and “the terminus” was a goal tem-
porarily beyond reach. In the shops oppo-
site, the tradespeople lost their grip on busi-
ness and poured the history of the ancient
house into any ear ready to listen.
There was but little of “The Willows”
left standing, and that its oldest part—four
square wood-and-iron rooms and a roof. Its
later additions, pretentiously called “wings,”
had gone away in carts, and were being built
into new “desirable villas” in a “progressive”
suburb.
“The Willows” was new in the long, long
ago when men wore stove-pipe hats and long-
tailed coats. A young man wearing those
garments with distinction had built it, and
taken thither a lovely being in a crinoline
like a circus tent. Here they had lived and
raised descendants who held their heads
high. The house was a monument of haughty
respectability and a credit to the shire.
So' it stood, growing in status and im-
portance till the original owner had ex-
changed the coat aqd hat for wings and a
halo.
After that came changes and more
changes. “The Willows” went down as
modern buildings went up. Now it was a
boarding-house, anon a lodging-house, and
finally “an empty.” The shire advanced
step by step till it became a bursting suburb
with a butchery flanking the old house on
one hand and a hair-raising sawmill clatter-
ing on the other. Now the end had come.
“The Willows” was to go.
The contractor advertised alluringly in the
dailies. It was offered to speculators, to
private individuals, to the man in the street.
But no one wanted an old square house with
low ceilings and cramped rooms —none save
lunatics; and the readers of the advertise-
ments were sane men and up-to-date, know-
ing the building regulations from A to Z.
The contractor was interviewing the fore-
man.
“Anyone been?” he said, nodding sideways
towards the four remaining rooms.
“Plenty lookin’, but they won’t give the
price yer arskin’. ’Ere’s the last offer, this
Dago ’ere, 20 quid. All ’e’s got, evidently.”
“All right,” said the contractor. “Take
*er, she’s yours; though, mind yer, if I wasn’t
pushed for time she’d ha’ brought 30 notes
easy. The usual terms o’ contract, o’ course
—take her within seven days or forfeit!”.
“Seven days!” cried the buyer in
wounded tones. “I dake her to-morrow.
The gartage contractor I liaf engage alretty.
I leaf my leetle ’ouse in Feetzroy, what the
meenister call de zlum, an’ leeve in dis man-
si-on.”
The departure of the exiled house was an
entertainment which drew such crowds that
the contractor went into his office and kicked
himself for not having charged gate money.
Men, boys and dogs hemmed in the swearing
and sweating drivers, who with levers prized
the house from its foundations. Officious
hands of the idle helped it on to rollers, get-
ting jambed, getting cursed. And a big
policeman arrested a marine merchant who
stole two doorknobs, and over everything
scrambled a black-browed foreigner in a cap
of fur. » * *
The fledgling suburb of Myosia was justly
proud of itself. Its street-gardens and red-
roofed villas made it charming at any time,
but it was more so on this day of fete.
Councillor Bangs was presenting a drinking
fountain to the school children. Flags
flapped and bunting hung from the Town
Hall windows. On the footpath was a
roped-in enclosure holding the councillors
and influential citizens. The school children,
wearing badges and carrying pannikins with
which to slake their thirst at the new fon n "
tain, were drawn up on benches. ihe
Mayor was presiding, and his lady was to
have first turn of the tap.
Just as the ancient house neared the turn
which would launch it into Myosia s all un-
suspecting main street, the Mayor, having
let off some rhetorical flights anent the
generosity of Bangs, sat down. There was
atteSoTif and an unrehearsed

The nhiilu. at °r ce : ~K v, e ry neck was craned.
Ihe childien climbed the galleries to get a
better, view. The Mayor rose upon his
fh th^°ne - A water-bottle prominent
upon the crimson table was overturned, and
the mayoral bouquet was upset in the dust
Boom enough for fret and tumult!
A t in # y , bulk > Pierced with blanks which
once had been windows, was approaching
nay, was upon them. The old house, proud
no longer, but rakish and cringing like a
prig convicted of bad habits, had come to
Myosia.
. A ii f be available police pounced upon the
intruder and waved it back—back to perdi-
;L° n ; . dt . was trop. Had it no decency
that it intruded on civic life at such a
moment! The driver pulled up and tried
to explain the situation; but all coherency
was lost in a torrent of broken English pro-
ceeding from the innards of the house, where
I *' a j_i_ own T ?,,. was . fusing it easy, in company
with a Lilliputian pony.
ihe police, uncertain whether to imprison
the entire concern for trespass or to recog-
nise its right of way, hesitated. The Mayor
was torn between his abhorrence of the dis-
reputable bulk and his allegiance to the elo-
quence of Bangs. The councillors and in-
fluential persons who formed the inner ring
were in a state of tumultuous curiosity, im-
perfectly suppressed, anent the intruder
which, so to speak, squatted malevolently
upon their heels.
Bangs, his last pearl of speech crystallised
upon his lips, meanwhile cursed the ancient
house. The blood mounted darkly to his
brow. The set of his jowl was a threat in-
He cleared his throat, and hem’d.
Ihe Mayor tried to ignore the unrest seeth-
ing in the background, and signed Bangs to
proceed. He called the meeting to order.
The councillors sat down and the teachers
pulled the children to attention with per-
emptory tweakings.
Bangs tried to catch the collective eye of
his audience. But the thing was not to be
done. It was clear to the youngest scholar
that he had lost grip. He grew angry and
cursed in his throat. His chance at the next
election—yea, even the very speech he had
prepared, was threatened with sacrifice by a
frowsy interloper.- He lost nerve, became
incoherent and fumbled his words.
“Fellow townsmen,” he shouted, “I make
a present o’ this drinkin’ fountain Oh,
dammit —I beg pardon!” He bowed to the
Mayor’s lady. “Look ]ere, Briggs” (and he
leapt to the Mayor’s side and continued his
speech in plain, forceful English). “Can
we continyer in matters of importance while !
that —that rat-’ole blocks the street! As a
citizen an’ a propputy owner, I protes’ ’ere
an’ now agin the dirty action o’ some muni-
cipality unknown in foistin’ a dirty shack
like this ’ere on a clean an’ self-respectin/
comoonity. I”
A burst of “Hear, hears” silenced Bangs.
“I regret, ladies and gentlemen,” bawled ,
the Mayor, “that an untimely interruption
has brought this presentation ceremony to I
an untimely conclusion. Mark me, citizens”
—here he looked darkly at the house—“more
will be heard of this insult. Meanwhile I
declare this meeting adjourned.”
Hastily tearing off his mayoral robe he
flung it aside. The leading horse, a steed of
mettle, took fright at the fluttering millinery,
and backed. The old house plunged to one
side and tore away the red lamp at the doc-
tor’s gate. Some flags became entangled in
the harness, and a form full of children was
upset. The air seemed full of riot, and the
horses bolted, with the house see-sawing and
swaying. Bolted almost over the Mayoress;
almost over the new fountain.
“Disgraceful!” roared Bangs, supporting
the moaning Mayoress. “Scandalous! Bet-
ter now, ma’am? Shockin’ things, these old |
’ouses, bringing germs and—and—bac—bae-
chuses.”
Bangs bounced into the Town Hall, and,
after a long consultation, bounced out again,
primed with whisky. Mounted in buggies and
the mayoral motor, the whole corporation
pursued the obscene interloper—pursued it
to a vacant lot, which was vacant no longer.
It was a pathetic picture. One end of the
old house was already on the ground, the
other still rested on the rollers. In the dis-
tance it appeared to be kneeling in prayer,
like some very dirty pauper pleading for
life.
But there was little room for such
thoughts in the breasts of Bangs and com-
pany. All they could see was a blot on the
landscape; a fouling of Myosia and its villa
sites.
A nimble official, after a great scene with
a black-browed foreigner, who was trying to
stable his horse in the parlor, had skipped
inside and was now running his measure—
merely as a matter of form—round the walls
of the foredoomed house.
“As you said, gen’lemen,” he announced
civilly, “it does not conform to the regula-
tions in any respect.”
Wagging of beards among the councillors
and a voice: “Mus’ conform reggylations—
mus’ enforce reggylations.”
The councillors said “Yea” with one voice.
The Ancient House said nothing. Travel-
racked and decrepit, it was deaf alike to in-
sult and the jibing of the wind. Then again
the voice of Bangs:—
“Well, gen’lemen. I think we’re all agreed,
eh? No need, to sit on the subject—eh?”
“We could bring the matter up for dis-
cussion next meeting—merely as a matter of
form,” murmured the town clerk.
“Suttinly, suttinly ! An’ now, gen’lemen,
shall we leave Mr. Inspector to do his dooty?
We’ve done our part, which is to protect
propputy agin these old derelicts cornin’ ’ere
an”
* * # *
Nightfall found the lot occupied by a weep-
ing foreigner with a barrow. The old house
was looking quite smart in a set of flaring
yellow labels, bearing the word “Con-
demned.”

IDNBY DISBASK in its worst form comes on almost unnoticed, and often reaches an
incurable stage before it is found out.
That is why it is so serious. You may feel as if you have no kidney trouble
there may be no symptoms except an occasional twinge of pain in the loins and back, a
heavy, drowsy feeling, or little watery swellings under the eyes or in the ankles. And yet if the
water were chemically tested the kidneys might be found to be in a seriously diseased state calling
for long and patient treatment.
In other patients, however, the symptoms may be more distinct ; there may be sharp
pains in the back, gravel, urinary disorders, or obstinate dropsy. Uric acid poison, left in the
blood by weak kidneys, may settle in the form of sharp, jagged crystals in the muscles and joints,
causing the pain of rheumatism and sciatica.
Kidney disease is hard to cure, because it is so difficult to tell from the symptoms how
serious a stage the disease has reached. But if you have any of the symptoms lose no time in
beginning with DoaiPs Backache Kidney Pills, and persevere with them until every trace of the
disease is gone-for as long as the least sign of kidney trouble remains, a sudden relapse is
always to be feared.
Sydney Testimony.
LASTING CURE OF 2 YEARS.
Mrs. C. Horne, Boot Store, 52 Abercrombie Street,
City, says: “For years I suffered from severe pains in
my back and hips, caused through my kidneys being
weak and disordered. Other symptoms were loss of
appetite, sleepless nights, bad headaches, and a dull,
tired feeling, which I could not get rid of. No one has
any idea how I suffered, and I was beginning to think
life was a misery to me, but I am thankful to say all
that is changed now. I heard someone speaking very
well of Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills, so got a bottle
to try them, and this wonderful remedy soon drove the
pain out of my back, and restored my kidneys to a
healthy state. I now feel a different woman, and I am
very grateful to Doan’s Backache Kidney Pills for my
lasting cure. I have been nerfectly well since these
Pills cured me two years ago, and I have no fear of my
ailment ever returning.”
LASTING CURE OF 8 YEARS.
JVIr. J. H. Price, 307 Young Street, Annandale, says:
*or about six months I suffered with backache. The
constant pain prevented me from getting proper rest at
night. All my movements were restricted, for if I
stooped or moved about much the torture was dreadful.
I used various remedies, but obtained no relief. I was
very anxious for a cure, and when Doan’s Backache
Kidney Pills were recommended to me I immediately sent
for a bottle. They commenced to do me good at once,
and a course of the pills effectually banished the pain. I
h3vc been fiee of b3.ck3.che for four veurs now so C3n
say that I am perfectly cured.”
Four years later Mrs. Price says: “I am pleased to be
able to bring the above statement up to date bv telling
you that my husband is still well, and he has been per-
fectly free of backache since Doan’s Backache Kidney
Pills cured him eight years ago.”

The Other Side.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
man was to blame, so they say.
Well, it may be....but let us dis-
cover
What charged him so late in the day
With the passionate tires of tne lover.
He was honesty, honor and truth ,
Did well; did his best; did his duty;
Till, rich as a flower in her youth,
She blinded his soul with her beauty.
She seemed like a wind among trees
At day’s sleepy noon softly blowing;
Suggestive of languor and ease,
And little loves drowsy and glowing.
The sun and the stars seemed to rise
(Having known her, he thought) in new
splendor,
The lure of Nile’s Queen in her eyes —
The power, the pretence, the surrender.
Her voice was a lute, dulcimer;
Her song the low song of a siren,
Soul-chaining a mute mariner
In fetters more binding than iron.
Her mouth, small and curved, had the red
That the orchid in hot glooms discloses,
Or the scarlet of blood newly shed
By Youth done to death among roses.
Her touch, silken soft, was as flame
Melting wax with its crimson caresses;
A lure and a charm without name
Lurked deep in the dusk of her tresses.
As the snake, scarlet-tongued—Death and
Grace- —•
Hid in ferns, wicked-eyed, softly hissing,
Draws the bird to its bruising embrace,
She drew him with passionate kissing.
Then ended his dream, as all ends,
And the man stood a traitor to duty....
But what of the woman, my friends,
And the power of her perilous beauty?
N.s.w.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
WE paced up and down the beach at
Gavutu in the tropic twilight and
talked of ghosts. Little Captain
Brown, in his white suit and with his cat-
like walk, looked, himself, not unlike a small
prowling phantom. Now and then, when he
struck a match, his black eyes glittered in
the sudden light like the eyes of a nocturnal
animal.
“No,” he said, “I was never afraid of a
nigger—living.”
“Or dead, Captain?”
He reflected a moment.
“I don’t know,” he remarked slowly; “I
used to laugh at their talk about ghosts, and
made up my mind to do a little missionary
work amongst them on my own account by
knocking this degrading superstition out of
them. I was a darned fool, sonny. So is
anybody who tries to upset the next world
of other people. It’s all right and proper to
kick a nigger while he is alive, but it isn’t
the square thing to vex his ghost.”
The Captain knocked the "sh off the end
of his cigar and continued
“There’s a Ghost Island, not far from
here, that the natives hold particularly
sacred. Anyhow, they will not set foot on
it, unless under compulsion. Well, I wanted
some timber, one day, and I made four of
my boys row me ashore and cut down a tree
or two. Man, you should have seen their
faces! Their eyes were all whites, and their
skin was the color of seaweed, and all the
time their heads were over their shoulders
looking behind them. You never saw such
a picture of mortal terror in all your born
days. They were ready to cut and run at
any moment, but I was between them and
the boat, and I threatened to shoot the first
man who turned back. When we came to
the middle of the island —it was only a small
one —we found a deep, cup-like hollow, paved
with rotten vegetation, and smelling like a
newly-opened grave. The place was deadly
quiet, and I seemed to feel horrible things
closing in on me and pawing my face with
clammy, obscene hands. I was growing sick
and giddy, and I called out to the boys to
return. I intended to leave the cut timber
behind, and then I thought that if I did so
the natives would think I was scared, and
the moral lesson would be lost on them. So
I made them tow the sticks behind the boat.
There was amongst my crew an old fellow
who was fond of me, and who used to take
liberties. He said that if the ghost-trees
were taken aboard the vessel she would never
have any more luck. Well, look at her
now !”
The captain pointed to where a dark bulk
rose out of the water, about a hundred
fathoms from the shore.
“That’s my schooner —all I have in the
world. And she has a hole in her side as big
as a church door. One night as we were
coming through a passage where there ought
to have been, and always was before, water
enough to float an ocean liner, a reef seemed
to rise suddenly from the bottom of the sea,
and it stuck its horns through her, and there
she lies. I don’t try to explain the coinci-
dence, as they call it, and I don’t want to
believe that it had anything to do with
what occurred on the Ghost Island; but
there’s the ship, a w r reck, and here am l—
another.”
“And the natives who went ashore with
you on the island, Captain?”
“Two of them died within a month after-
wards. I don’t know what became of the
others. I haven’t seen them since.”
This talk set me thinking of some of my
own experiences with ghosts—or, rather,
ghost-seers—when I belonged to a Spook
Society. It was in the days when Alfred
Deakin was a handsome young man with a
silken beard and a silver voice. He spoke as
fluently then as he does now, but there was
poetry in his speech in those far-off times.
Instead of spilling his fine eloquence on
Preferential Trade, he discoursed with sweet
persuasiveness on Karma, and the Wheel,
and Swedenborg, and the esoteric meaning of
“The House that Jack Built.” His face
shone with spiritual light from within, his
voice was soft and clear as the sound of a
bell calling to prayer on a Sabbath evening
in summer, and his clothes were always
well brushed and his boots well polished. It
was mainly through the impression this
radiant apparition made upon me that I
joined the Spook Society.

loathed the spooks, and despised the spook-

of scorn fixed upon us as we trailed up the
stairs. We were, certainly, a weird crew.
There was a little elderly lady # with cork-
screw curls and a perpetual simper, who
talked of the dear spirits as if she in-
tended some day to borrow money from
them. She was a boardinghouse-keeper in
a small depressed way. Vi ith her came her

One evening I arrived late, and, instead
of going upstairs, started to talk with the
tailor’s wife. Her husband had once owned
a fine business, and they lived happily and
comfortably. He had no vices—didn’t drink
or smoke, or gamble, or run after other
women—and was as kind as man could be.
Then he fell in with the spiritualists, and
everything began to go to rack and ruin. He
neglected his business, and it dropped away
from him bit by bit. till they had come down
to the little shop in which we stood, and
which hardly earned enough to pay its rent
and keep them alive. Her husband was
never satisfied unless he was sitting at a
table with a lot of crazy fools like himself

When the lights were turned down and
we were gathered around the table, male and
f ema le sitting alternately as at a dinner,
w ith hands outspread and the tips of our
little fingers touching, the medium would
say . “Now we will sing something of a

The w ] ndow was left open for them to

tbe business of the evening would commence.
in a few moments everybody would be play-
;ng) an( j the table would be dancing, and
tbe medium twitching and convulsing like a
bam in a fit. This was the time to push the
s j a t e an d pencil over to him. He would
se j ze the pencil and make spasmodic stabs at
the slate. The spirits were understood to
be guiding his hand. They all seemed to be
sho f. kingl * bad writers, but we used to be
ab j e to dec ip ber such oracular messages as
« The Starry ones surround you.” “Be of
good heart, and hasten. Those who have
g ()ne before await you. There is ioy in the
Halls of Light.” “The sister of Susan sal-
utes her. That sister is now a bright and
rad j an t being in the Land where there is no
care.” The latter message came from Mary
Ann, the dead cook, of course. Some of our
other friends in Spookland used to stay
away occasionally, but Mary Ann never
deserted us. All these spooks used to speak
in the third per son—as if they were Potts
Point aristocrats inviting you to dinner,
x can honestly say that I tried hard to find
something worth knowing in spiritualism. I
failed utterly. So did the sporting reporter,
and the two of us were eventually requested
to resign from the circle, as our presence
had a discouraging effect upon the spirits,
Th»y are all ghosts now, all but myself
and the Sporting Reporter. I wonder if they
remember those old times?
