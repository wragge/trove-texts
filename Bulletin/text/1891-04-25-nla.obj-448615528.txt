yrhc extraordinary reputation of Rowland’s Macassar

(offer spurious "imitations under the lure of being cheap;
the principle on which each is prepared is -confined
solely to the knowledge of A. Rowland & Sons, of 20,

SPECIALIST for the Treatment of Nervous
Complaints, ciabetes, Tumors, &c.
Registered by the Medical Jto rI of N.S. W. Lite House Sur-
geon 1 1 the Great I\ orthern Hospital. London
T am aware that I am not strictlv following the paths
of professional et’qnette by advertising myself as a
Si rcinlist h r the t 1 eutin'nt of this classof disease, but,
unfortunately for the suffering public in Australia, the
apathy shown by Qualified Men in the treatment of
( lirunic, ami Nervous Complaints has induced men of the
. lowest grade of intellect (whose only qualifications are
unlimited assurance) to spring up, and by specious
advertisements and false promises trap the unwary.
It is very evident that sufferers from these diseases
have been scandalously treated by these unqualified
persons The evidence taken at the Medical Enquiry
held in Sydney (published in the Daily Telegraph, Nov.
<hh 7th and Sth. 1K)D) plainly shows the disgraceful
manner in which patients are duped. Not only are
they robbed of their money, but what is of infinitely
greater importance, their health is injured also. It is
Therefore,.time that I.egally Qualified Wen entered the
field to fight these pests of society with their own
Weapons, viz., Advertising*
It is utterly impossible for those who are suffering
fro a the e diseases, who are scattered over« 11 parts of
Australasia, to ascertain which Qualified Practitioner
makes ihcse diseases his speciality unless he advertises.
I consider therefore, that by advertising I not o .ly
strike a hhw at the Quackery which now exists, but I also add
to the ns-f,tin ess of my profession and in no tv ay lessen my

SATURDAY, APRIL 25, 1891.
The Progress of the Federal Discussion.
L’Abbe Sieves, who had always a fresh con-
stitution' for" a regenerated France in his
portfolio, 1 was accustomed to reply when told
that the particular scheme which he had pre-
sented for consideration at the moment,
“ wouldn’t do,” that he “ would prepare
another,” It is , now pretty evident that
Griffith, the Sieves of the Australasian
Federal Convention, will be informed by the
Australian thatGhe Constitution Bill—elabor-
ated by him, in Queensland, with so much
care and so much smelling of the lamp, and
which he brought with him in his valise to
Sydney as a necessary preliminary to fashion-
ing it, red-hot, in Convention (much as the
stage-cook compounds under the public eye
the pie built ages before in the property-
man’s mysterious den) will not do at all. It
certainly will not do ; and we do not suspect
that when the negative of the provinces is
communicated to Sir Samuel he will have any
stronger objection to “preparing another”
than his prototype. He will be wise if he
manifest an equal pliancy ; for he cannot be
ambitious of making the “D.S.G.” of North
Queenslanders the universal toast of the
Australian. There are some tributes to his
personal eminence and to his political power
which even a vain politician like Griffith
—and there is no vanity like that of your
cold-blooded man—would not care to see
circulating over a larger area. And in any
case, “ Damn Sam Griffith !” will not ring
so pleasantly from the lips of the coming
generations as “ Another Washington— the
Father of his Country !”
## # ,
It was upon Griffith that the greater
share of the work of preparing the Bill to
create the Commonwealth of Australia fell ;
it is he—and not Parkes —whom posterity
will regard as the master-builder of the
ship ; it was he who guided it from the
stays and off the stocks into deep water ; and
it is he who will have to finesse the craft
through the shallows. In so far as the
creation of the Commonwealth will be the
act of any one man, it will be Griffith s,
for his was, distinctively, the Iggal and con-
structive mind of the Convention. He will
justly claim the honours and rewards of
success if the ship of the new nation,
freighted with richer hopes than were ever
borne by the fabled • argosy, reaches- the fair
haven ; but woe to his name and to his fame
if she prove but a coffin-ship after all!
«- * *
It is to Griffith, then, that the people of
Australia will look for that elucidation of the
Constitution which is to commend it to the ,
Australian mind and aspirations. Parkes
has spoken to his “colony,” Munro to his,
and the greatest admirer of the work of the
Convention must experience, despair at the
futility of both attempts to unravel the knots
of the problem. From Playford, of South
Australia, much of educative value might be
expected but for the consideration that he
will be driven, almost certainly, to an ex-
tremist's defence of the Bill owing to the
critical attitude that Downer, Cockburn
and Kingston .will take towards it ; from
h vsh, of Tasmania, nothing will be received
of an importance beyond that of his own
yardstick. It is Griffith whom Australia
wishes to hear and from whom it has a right
to demand an explanation. As the principal
framer of the Constitution, he must be pre-
pared to defend it, to intimate where it may
be improved, and to indicate what he pro-
poses to do to effect improvements. And
this last, we submit, is the question for him.
He cannot, unless he is giving the lie to his
past, be satisfied with the measure as it is.
He has struggled within his State for the
restriction of Imperialism to innocuous
-dimensions,- and-there-he, fought, as- no ether-
Australian politician, except Berry, fought
within h i. s province, the plutocratic and squat-
tucratic element. Can he, after reflection
upon the Constitution as a whole, assert that
the vigorous instincts which achieved for him
his Queensland renown have been granted
full play in the Convention ?
* * #
Griffith has lost one opportunity of
shaping the Australian sentiment. Let him
not lose another. When he speaks, let him
answer criticism, and not evade it, and, if he
cannot answer, and will not commit an
evasion, let him accept the position. He
permitted himself to yield to temporising
tendencies, the result of which is, that the
Constitution gives a fuller recognition to
Imperialism than has been accorded by
“ Colonial ” practice of the last decade, and
thus he was forced into a false position. Let
him have the courage to retrieve it ; let him
show that, strong man as he was in Conven-
tion, he can still be stronger, and can,
GuLLiVER-like, throw aside the Lilliputian
restraints with which he allowed himself to
be bound. If he will do this, he may save
himself the ignominy of being told to “ pre-
pare another.”
* * it
The one particular on which the Federal
States must be informed before the Federal
compact is entered into—and which, satis-
factorily settled, other difficulties, even those
of the Imperial connection, of tariffs and of
territories, will be adjusted—is State-right.
Who, in the conflict which will as surely
come as night follows the day, will be the
ultimate and final authority ? Jefferson
said the American States “were co-ordinate
departments of a simple and undivided
whole.” Will this be the status of the
Federated Australias, or will they be sub-
ordinate always and in all things to the
Federal Government ? Is the Federal Go-
vernment to be the agent of the Sovereign
States, or their master ? Is the Federal
Government the product of a compact
between the individual provinces, or is it a
party to such compact ? Upon the answer
to these questions will depend the reply to
one other—Can any State nullify an act of
the Federal Parliament, or render void the
administrative procedure 'of the Federal
Government ? The Constitution, it will be
said, already answers this final question, by
ordering “that when a law of the State
is inconsistent with the law of the
Common wealth, the latter is to prevail.”
True, 'it answers it —on paper. Turn
to the discussions in convention, and it
is obvious that this clause was voted en masse
without the slightest significance of its fatal
tendency. The principle of nullification is
the Conservative principle of the Federal
Union, for it implies the right to separate
when injustice is inflicted. If it be de-
signedly abandoned by the several States,
upon a full acquaintance with what is in-
volved in the act of surrender, well and
good; but let us not hastily and thoughtlessly
force on Union when the bloody finger of
history warns us that within that clause
there are the seeds of rebellion and of
internecine strife. A Federal Union
must be, in its essence, indissoluble;
but if it is not to be welded again
by force, after being cleft by the sword,
that principle of nullification must be intelli-
gently and voluntarily surrendered. For
the States to accept now the Constitution
with the second clause of Chapter 5, con-
tained therein, a clause which was voted
blindly and, we dare say, ignorantly, is to
invite civil war. Let Griffith explain if he
can, why this pitfall has been placed on
the Federal path ; if he cannot do it, no other
Conventionist can. And until an explana-
tion be forthcoming we say, “ Hold off! ”
* * *
Parkes, Premier of New South Wales,
has spoken to his constituents, and Munro,
Premier of Victoria, has spoken to his.
Coming fresh from Convention with their
mutual-admiration speeches still ringing in
their ears, it was only to be expected that
two such politicians had nothing but good to
say of their recent work. Unstinted lauda-
tion, of the . Constitution was the charac-
teristic of both deliveries, and neither
speaker considered he was under any obliga-
tion to excuse the proceedings of a body
which had done all in its power to cripple
the Australias to a degree that was beyond
the power of the Imperial Parliament to
do of its own motion. The popular
acceptance of the Constitution must
be an effect of an awakened public
intelligence and an enlarged apprehension by-
Australians of the Federal principle—of its
historic basis, of all that the idea implies, of
all the responsibility it confers, of all the in-
spiring dignity which lies at its core. It
was “ the manifest duty of each Premier”—
the phrase is not ours', but Monro's in Con-
vention—to educate the people he repre-
sented as he had himself been educated—to
put before the ■people of his State his reasons
for his individual adhesion to the Constitu-
tion, his explanation of his conduct in de-
parting from his previously-declared con-
victions, and his new notion of the federal
bond. Tested by this definition, which was
applauded by every Premier of Australasia
as it was uttered, what was Parkes’ speech
at St. Leonards, what was Munro’s at Gee-
long ? They were the outpourings of men
either ignorant or insincere, or both. Parses
declared that the Senate of the Common-
wealth has had for its exemplar “that most
august of legislative bodies, the American
Senate.”
* . .... . , #
Now, the Senate of the American
States perfectly represents the indivi-
duality of the .several States in the
Union, and it derives its august nature
from this fact. But its perfection of
I’epresentative function is the corollary of
its possession of co-ordination of legislative
power with the popular Chamber, or in its
exclusive capacity to revise certain acts of
the Executive, which peculiar attribute
balances the deprivation to which it is sub-
jected with respect to one or two depart-
ments of legislation. The Senate of the
Commonwealth will occupy no such repre-
sentative position, for co-ordination of power
and function is denied it by the Constitu-
tion, and a piece of gear constructed instead
which, in our judgment, will, by reason of
its inherent imperfection, throw the whole
machinery of the Government into disorder.
For the New South Wales Premier to assert
that the two Senates are endowed with
analogous capacities and occupy similar posi-
tions, is utterly at variance with the certain-
ties of the case. Than this statement nought
could be more mischievous, or, if made in-
sincerely, more immoral. We acquit him,
however, in this instance of an attempt t j
wilfully mislead the people, for the function
of the States, as expressed by the Senate in
U.S. Federalism, is, perhaps, the most deli-
cate'known to any existing legislative system,
and Parkes’ order of mhid is such that he
is never.to be depended upon for a true
perception of what is exactly delimited or
finely discriminated. As a putter-forth of
vague, resonant and pretentious generalisa-
tions, these provinces do not own his equal ;
he has an unrivalled faculty for seeing the
superficial and cruder aspects of a question ;
but in the quality of intellect which is
essential to the detection of differences in
things which seem like, he is absolutely
deficient. No man, however, can be a safe
guide in the intricacies of legislation, and
especially in the peculiarly-delicate business
of Constitution-making, who keeps on the
surface. It is in the depths that the sunken
rocks lie, and the American Union was nearly
wrecked because the Northern States adhered
to the implied significance of a phrase in its
Constitution, and the Southern States the
plain, superficial meaning. Parkes is in-
capable of educating the people on the true
nature and ramifications of federal institu-
tions, because he himself has yet to undergo
a process of further education. He lias
learned much since he made his Tentertield
speech in 1889 ; for he has learned that the
particular Federal Constitution he then out-
lined has no chance of being called into
existence. Whatever other faults the
Commonwealth Constitution has. it is not a
replica of the Canadian. Parkes, knowing
this, may yet learn more.
* # #
As with Parkes, so with Munro. His
conception of Federation would be puerile if
it were not for his office. Since, however,
he is not merely Munro, but Premier of
Victoria, his words must be discussed as
seriously as the circumstances will permit.
In his speech at Geelong, he was apparently
resolved to leave Parkes the honour of being
pre-eminently silly. Yet Parkes’ notion of
senatorial functions was wisdom itself com-
pared with Munko’s idea of how the safety-
valve of the Constitution—the power of
amendment—is to be applied, or with his
sense of the status of the Federal Capital.
Dismissing the latter point in a couple of
sentences, we will ask, What is to be the
function of the Capital ? Is it not to be the
seat of the Central Government ? Then, it
is patent that it must not be overawed by
local aggregation of wealth or population, if
the Government is to do justice and preserve
equity as between the States. Freeman,
the one Englishman whose contributions to
the literature of the Federal principle are
monumental, declares that in nothing was
the wisdom of the framers of the American
Constitution made so conspicuous or more jus-
tified by the issue than in making the seat of
authority a ] urely Federal district. The
direct and indirect independence of the
peculiar federal territory is imperative to
the safe working of the Constitution, and
the Convention were as distinctly oblivious
to what was demanded from them in refer-
ing the selection of a site for the capital to
the Federal Parliament as they were in
refusing to make the “ One man one vote ”
the basic principle of the Federation, It is
not a subordinate issue, hut a main one ;
and Munro would settle it by making Gse-
long—a suburb of Melbourne—the seat of
Commonwealth authority ! Geelong also has
the disadvantage that it would be accessible
to a British force when one is sent to
emulate the noble example set in the burn-
ing of Washington !
* # #
But Munro excels himself and beats even
Parkes hollow when he conies to elucidate
the capacity of the States to amend the
Constitution. It is the Victorian Premier’s
wish, and that of the majority of his
colleagues in the Convention that the States
shall accept the Bill as it now stands,
and that any amendments deemed desirable
by any individual , State shall be sub-
mitted to the Federal Parliament thence to
be decided upon ! When the Constitution
is adopted by the people, the chapter in the
Bill thus providing for amendment may be
regarded as historically and theoretically
sound, but to propose to bring the same
routine into operation before the Bill becomes
law is surely a suggestion that ought to be
laughed out of the discussion, and could only
have occurred to a Conventionist who had
never taken the trouble to understand the
rudimentary operation of the principle sought
to-be expressed in the Bill. The State Con-
ventions which are to be called to adopt the
Constitution—and to consider it ! —may,
Munro acquiesces, suggest amendments,
but they can only accept the Bill as
it now stands, and then submit their
amendments to the Federal Parliament.
This plan could only have any value if the
Parliament had power to forthwith incor-
porate the amendments with the Constitu-
tion. But such power is designedly with-
held from it—and properly. All that the
Parliament could do, the majority of both
Houses coinciding, and the Governor-General
being I willing , would be to send the amend-
ments for adoption —to whom ? To
the very State Conventions from whom
the amendments had emanated ! The
genius of circumlocution never conceived a
better method of how not to do it.
For the' State Conventions to amend,
and to place their amendments, if
any, before the State Parliament, thence
to be sent to a second or a third Federal
Convention, by which plan the Federal Par-
liament would not be constituted till there
was, at least, an approximation to a perfect
Constitution, would be too simple a plan for
the Victorian Premier or—there is an
alternative—too honest. To follow the
Munro idea would be to indefinitely post-
pone the amendment of the Constitution in
the radical, the democratic, the Australian
direction. That is, perhaps, its object, for
it is approved by the Argus, which never
yet placed its seal of approval on any pro-
posal that designed to give effect to the
popular will. The Argus imprimatur damns
it as antagonistic to democracy.
Freetrade or Federation—Which?
The Pakkes Government has obviously got its
war-whoop ready for the approaching New
South Wales general election, and its cry will
be Freetrade and Australian Federation. There
is no visible connection between Freetrade and
Federation—in fact, under present conditions
the two principles, or rather the one principle
and a fetich, are distinctly antagonistic—but
for several years past it has been apparent that
Freetrade cannot stand alone, and it is necessary
to find something for that pne-legged creed to
lean up against. It has leaned upon a good
many things at various times, but it is a notable
circumstance that it never leaned upon the
same article twice. A few years ago it bor-
rowed the Almighty to shore up Parkes, and
the statement went forth that the Protestant
faith would come to grief if a tax were put on
M‘Millan’s calico ; and it was understood that
the Lord would be indignant if the imported
hardware business was discouraged, and would
give over New South Wales to the dominion
of the Pope. When this dank and flabby
lie died a natural death, the Mongol was
pressed into the service of the Good Cause, and
the apostles of Free Competition travelled for a
while on the unsupported assertion that they
alone, among all the men on earth, w'ere fitted
to prevent the free competition of the cheap
Chinaman, and that Freetrade in general meant
Protection against the objectionable Asiatic.
The statement was obviously a glaring false-
hood, for the imposition of a prohibitive cus-
toms duty on the Mongolian was an outrage on
every axiom of the Foreign-trade gospel, but
Parkes’s hair carried it through successfully.
Even the Chinaman, however, is worn out now,
and as a bald and naked policy of Freetrade
would be howled down with derision in every
electorate throughout New South Wales, the
party will travel in the present instance on the
tale of Australian Federation. And when it
gets started it will assert, with a glad and
joyous disregard of facts and dates and common
intelligence, that the country must take Parkes
and Freetrade and Federation all together,
because if it doesn’t have Freetrade it can’t
have Federation, and if it doesn’t take Parkes
it can’t have either of them, and if it doesn’t
have the whole three it will go to
smash. At the present moment it is
difficult to decide whether New South Wales
will notice the discrepancy or not. The
assertion is as conspicuously absurd as any
merely human statement can be; and if the
party declared that a man without feet couldn t
have a hat, and that if he hadn’t a boil on his
back he couldn’t have either feet or a hat, it
would keep quite as close to the region of


accuracy ; but, nevertheless, the New South
Wales Freetrade party will make the assertion,
and the result remains to be seen.
# * #
Therefore New South Wales will be dis-
figured from east to west and from north to
south with bills calling on the nation to vote for
Parkes and Freetrade and Federation, and the
Freetrade statistician, with his wide, untravelled
wastes of assurance and his endless store of
mendacity, will point to the Protectionist as a
soulless wretch who is blocking the way of
Australian unity. By the constant iteration of
this conspicuous lie a few weak-kneed Protec-
tionists will be induced to vote against Federa-
tion merely in order to differentiate themselves
from their opponents, and thus a certain air of
probability will bo lent to an assertion which is
badly in want of some such assistance. There
is only one Foreign-trade party, and Parkes is
its prophet, and consequently that astute old
man will get the votes of the whole scanty rem-
nant of the Freetraders, whether they believe
in Federation or not. He will also prospect for
the votes of any Protectionists who value
Federation more than Protection, and who are
too obtuse to recognise that Federation is pos-
sible with Protection, and absolutely impossible
with Freetrade. Ho will further look after the
suffrages of the labouring classes by pointing
out that the Protectionists only support the
principle of “One Man One Vote,” while he is
prepared to go the whole political hog and
advocate the policy of “ One Woman One Vote ”
in addition ; and many unthinking and illiterate
electors will fail to see that this addition is
merely a guarantee that the Upper House
will reject the whole scheme, whereby the
multiple vote of property will be saved
and yet the hypocritical Parkes will gain
the credit of having done his best to lose
it. And in addition to all this the Govern-
ment party will do its best to split up the
hostile vote by putting up bogus opponents
so as to divide the enemy’s camp into Federal
Protectionists and anti-Federal Protectionists,
Federal and anti-Federal Labour candidates,
and the like ; for though Parkes favours the
system of election by majorities only, he has
kept that theory on hand to whoop about at
the coming election, instead of passing it into
law for his own undoing. Among all these
chances the Parkes Cabinet has got a better
show for the future than appeared possible a
few weeks ago, and if the Federal excitement
can be kept up—provided there is any such
excitement at all —Sir Henry may be able by-
and-bye to throw ail objectionable colleagues
overboard and start afresh.
# # #
Should Parkes return with a majority, how-
ever, trouble will begin shortly afterwards, and
it will be necessary to cast a good many prin-
ciples into the sea to lighten the ship. The
grand theory of one vote, and one vote only, for
each inhabitant will probably be passed with
acclamation by the Assembly, and be allowed
to go to wreck in the Council for want of a
little timely pressure ; and then the nation can-
not reasonably jump on the Assembly, seeing
that body did its level best, and it cannot jump
on the Council, for that dejected museum is
inaccessible to popular indignation. The pro-
ject of election by absolute majorities only will
either go the same road, or else be smothered
and talked out while Parkes is absent owing to
his leg, which will probably develop new symp-
toms about that time ; and when he is brought'
down on a shutter to make a noble effort in the
interests of the democratic cause it will be too
late, And as to the two great axioms of Free-
trade and Federation, one of them must go, for
the two cannot exist together ; and which will
be sacrificed depends entirely on circumstances,
If the Australian Commonwealth is established,
then the represen tatiAms of Victoria, Queens-
land, South Australia, and Tasmania will
constitute a solid majority for Protection, and
the greating importing interest is a lost and
ruined and shoddy business for evermore. The
question is Commonwealth versus Calico
Jimniyism, and the result is doubtful and un-
certain.
# # #
There are various ivays of effecting a com-
promise under such Circumstances. One simple
and effectual method is by passing the Federa-
tion Bill Avith the addition of some utterly im-
possible stipulation in favour of Freetrade, and
when the other provinces refuse to accept this
proviso, the importers can curse at Protection
tor ever afterwards, on the ground that it, and
it alone, wrecked the glorious Commonwealth.
This scheme was adopted with considerable
success some years ago, and very few appeared
to realise that the result would have been just
the same if Ncav South Wales had demanded
the establishment of polygamy as the one condi-
tion on which it would join the Federal Council,
and had thereafter denounced the sinful mono-
gamous policy which hail ruined the nation. In
this case Ncav South , Wales Avill lose Federa-
tion, and save Freetrade and Parkes. On the
other hand, however, Parkes may think it best
to put the Federation Bill in front, and carry
it with the assistance of any available Protec-
tionists and such members of his own surprised
and disgusted party as will Mloav him, and
then take the chance of being the first Prime
Minister of all Australia. In such a situation
his own following of importers, lawyers, and
landlords Avould nave to submit through sheer
necessity, for to eject Parkes would be merely
to bring in Protection with a rush, while to
allow him to remain in office Avould at least
postpone the evil day until the Federal tariff
oanie into operation. In that case New South
Wales will lose Freetrade, but it will, at least,
save Federation and Parkes— in fact, if the
next election can be tided over, the State is
bound to save Parkes under all circumstances.
a third device is to endeavour to pass the
Federation Bill and whoop for Freetrade at the
same time—in fact, to pass it as a great Free-
h’ade measure, and trust that the dire stupidity
°f the shoddy party might prevent them recog
nising the obvious fact that Federation was, in
their case, only another name for destruction.
be party which could be sold so outrageously
18 capable °f any foolishness under the sun, but
still the scheme might succeed, and when the
inevitable disaster came, Parkes would pro-
bably have started a new career as a Protec-
tionist senator of the Commonwealth, and
would bo right out of reach.
# * #
Owing to various reasons, however, these
alternatives will not be laid before the electors
at present. For if the situation were explained in
all its bald and naked infamy the nation must
be divided into two sharply-defined sections —
a Freetrade party, sworn to oppose Federation
to the bitter end in the interests of foreign
imports; and a Protectionist party, which
might or might not support Federation, accord-
ing to the views of the majority of its members.
The first party would not want Parkes, because
he is a Federationist, and the second would
have no use for him because he is a Freetrader
—in fact, there would be no possible or con-
ceivable demand for Parkes anywhere. Then
either the Freetrade party must win under a
new leader, or else the Protectionist party
must come to the front, and instead of
Parkes, its qeader, if it had a leader, would
be in a position to bid for the first posi-
tion in the political world of Australia. With
this overwhelming difficulty in view Sir Henry
judiciously refrains from needless explanations.
If he can run Freetrade and Federation in
double-harness he will have at least a faint
prospect of success ; and if he could also secure
the vigorous and undivided support of the pub-
licans and the teetotallers, the priests, the
Orange lodges, Abigail, and the Cardinal, his
chances would be considerable. Unfortunately,
however, there is not time to hunt up all
these discordant elements and offer the whole
earth to each of them, and therefore Parkes will
go before the country at the next opportunity as a
disunited apostle of unity and a Freetrader who
desires to pass as the originator of a Protec-
tionist Commonwealth and take his chance in
these characters. If fortune attends him it will
be the last time the old man will want his obse-
quious party, and he doesn’t care what happens
to them afterwards. If the country will endorse
the Federation policy at the polls, and the
Federation Bill can be got through the Legisla-
ture by dint of hard coalescing with anybody
or everybody, or by any other means whatso-
ever, then Parkes will go away and be a
Federal statesman and have a long and dignified
rest from his old associates ; and if it doesn’t go
through it may at least help to prop up the
Freetrade party when it would otherwise have
gone under. For though Parkes may kick his
own party now under the impression that he is
done with it, yet if there be no Federation after
all he will come back and use it just as before,
and the kicking will be dropped into oblivion.
And if the whole Parkes faction collapses at
the polls like a snowball struck by a burning
comet, he will at least die for Federation instead
of Freetrade, which is an obvious advantage
seeing that he may resurrect again on the
Federal ticket, while Gehazi himself would get
up out of his tomb before the Freetrade ticket
could rise from its oblivion without something
stronger than itself to help it up.
Cool Cheek.
We desire to focus public attention for a few
moments on the school of law that has lately
been added as a new attraction to Sydney
University, The Chancellor, Sir William
Manning, is a lawyer—at any rate, he was a
judge—and naturally he has taken the legal
nursery under his especial charge. But he
isn’t satisfied with it. In his annual Commemo-
ration address he complained that it would not
fulfil half of its intended mission for the
advancement of legal learning and for the
elevation of the legal professions unless
rules were made by the judges for the
compulsory training of articled clerks under
appropriate portions of its curriculum. It
appears that the University has communi-
cated with the judges, who have not yet found
time to meet on the subject; but Sir William
hopes 1 ‘ that effective regulations may soon be
made, so that the benefits of the systematic
legal education afforded by the University may
be made to extend to this branch of the pro-
fession.” To put this open-handed benevolence
beyond the reach of suspicions Sir William
went further into particulars :
1 will also frankly state, in the interests of the Uni-
versity, that our school of law will be but poorly attended,
and will be in danger of languishing if confined to candi-
dates for the bar ; and such few candidates for the other
branch as may go through the whole course without
special encouragement, of whom, as I hear, there are
already some. I must also avow that the University
needs,'as in Victoria, the fees of the articled clerks to
contribute to the cost of the department, and to the
general administration of the University.
“Special encouragement,” which we have
taken the liberty of underlining, is distinctly
good. It is his Honor’s humorous way of refer-
ring to the compulsory rules by which the
articled clerks are to be rounded up into the
University lecture-rooms.
# * #
To put it straight, the drift of the conspiracy
in which the Senate wants the judges to join
is this : The University has imported an expen-
sive professor and started an elaborate system
for the instruction of sucking lawyers, but the
prospective brigands find they can do very well
without any such instruction. A youngster
who wants to become a lawyer, and who is
willing to work hard and read hard, can
learn his business just as effectually in the
office of a firm with a good connection as by
listening to the lectures of gentlemen whose
practice at the bar leaves them leisure to teach
in the law-school. But the University wants
money to pay its professor and lecturing-staff,
so the judges are asked to make rules to compel
articled clerks to pay the fees and attend
lectures whether they want them or not. For
serene effrontery the learned councillors are
hard to beat. The competition in the legal
profession, and the ever-working law of the
survival of the fittest, which wrought so that
James Martin, who began as an office-boy and
was made a present of his articles, died as Chief
Justice, may be trusted to make law students
take eager advantage of everything that will
give them a better chance in the race. If a
course at the University law school will put a
man ahead of those who never saw a University,
the law school will attract pupils, and be a
success. If it won’t do that, there is no reason
why pupils should go there, and to coerce them
there in order to put fees into the pockets of
the professor, or keep the University from drop,:
ing money over its new spec., would be shame-
less robbery.
* * *
What does it matter to the judges where a
lawyer learns his trade, so long as he knows it?
And what has it to do with the judges, any-
how ? The people who employ the lawyers are
the parties interested, and they are much more
concerned about the way their man does his
work than about the particular hall-mark he
bears. The judges have the power at present
of specifying what an articled clerk has to
know, and how much of it he must know, before
they let him commence preying on his own
account as a full-toothed solicitor, and that is
quite sufficient say for them to have in the
matter. If there were no examination at all,
the man who was best up in his work would, in
the long run, get the most work, as he does
now ; and the only way the Judges have of find-
ing out whether a man is up to Ids work or not
is by examination. If the examination be a
satisfactory test of a candidate’s fitness, then
no one will get through who is not fit, Univer-
sity lectures or no lectures ; if it be not a satis-
factory test, it ought to be abolished. In any
case, why should a man who has brains and
energy enough to master his trade without
spending time or money at the University be
compelled to spend these merely to bolster up
a crazy and, so far, “ fashionable ” monopoly ?
* # #
Chancellor Manning says that part of the
intended misson of the law school is “the ele-
vation of the legal profession.” That is one of
these pretty, class phrases that modern demo-
cracy is beginning to find out of late. What
have the public to do with the elevation of the
legal professions ? Why should the public be
taxed to put an extra coat of varnish on the
pretensions of any caste or class ? The eleva-
tion of the bricklaying profession is just as much
a matter of State concern as that of elevating-
lawyers. All we have to do with a bricklayer
is to see he lays his bricks properly, and a
lawyer has fulfilled his functions when
he wins our case or induces an intelligent
jury of our countrymen to find us not
guilty. He will not have any delicacy about
making us pay for that, and we have no
particular call to contribute to the expense of
his “elevation.” Furthermore, we know of
old what the elevation of a profession means in
the mouths of Mr. Chancellor Manning and
his class. It means the shutting out as far as
possible of everyone who hasn’t either a grand-
father or a full purse. It means the monopo-
lising of lucrative occupations by high-toned
and well-connected people whose names are
known at Darling Point and Toorak. It means
the repression of upstart brains, whose owners,
like Judge Real, in Queensland, lave an
ambition to work their way from the carpenter’s
bench to the bench of the Supreme Court.
# # #
There may lie many a young man now quali-
fying for a profession, and with a good chance
of getting into the front rank, who would be
snuffed out by a regulation compelling him to
attend University lectures in Sydney and pay
lecture fees. If he can study in [the country,
and present himself for examination when he is
ready, that will be the time for his University-
bred competitor to show his superiority. No
doubt it would be a good thing for the present
members of the lawyers’ guild to put new
difficulties in the way of the crowds who are
flocking in every term ; but the public interests
are best served by wholesome competition ; and
if anyone is to be snuffed out, let it be the
noodles with money and no brains, rather than
the men whose brains form their only stock-in-
trade.
* # #
The University senates of course adopt the
opposite principle, and will go on adopting it till
an earthquake of some sort rouses them to learn
that the University is a national concern, and
not their private show, The New South Wales
judges, who have the decision of this business,
made a hopeful show of common-sense a few
months ago when they abolished at one swoop
most of the restrictions that had been ac-
cumulating round the entrance-gate to the Bar.
If they display a reactionary spirit now, and do
anything to make the solicitors’ trade-union
more a monopoly of the culchawed classes than
it is at present, they will open the question why
that particular union should receive any more
legal recognition than other bodies of the same
sort. That is a question which it might be
useful for the Trades and Labor Council to look
into just now. The application of the “free-
dom of contract” doctrine to the case of the
man who wants Reconveyance drawn or a libel-
action fought, would put several hundred solici-
tors and barristers into prompt sympathy with
the shearers on strike at Barcaldine.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Man and the Gallows—A Race.
In Melbourne Gaol a race is in progress between
a man and a gallows, and the authorities are
much vexed and harassed by the fact that the
gallows is dropping behind. Consequently they
are considering the advisability of giving a lift
to the ancient implement of strangulation, or
fooling with the weights, or falsifying the han-
dicap, for all the public money has been piled
on that blood-stained object, and the man and
the gallows are both nearing their final turning-
point and only the last furlong of the race
remains to be run. Fatta Chand, Hindoo,
convicted of homicide on circumstantial evi-
dence, has a deep-rooted objection to Australian
modes of execution, having been taught by his
creed that he will be a lost and restless spirit
through all eternity if he dies ignominiqusly by
the hands of unbelievers, and therefore he is
trying to perish by self-starvation as a matter
of preference. The law and the hangman are
naturally afraid under these circumstances that
he may die ere he can be officially butchered,
and some indecent individual connected with
the administration of “justice” has even sug-
gested that he should be hanged a week earlier
than liis time, iest the gallows should lose the
race. Nobody kicked this person apparently,
or raised any strong objection to his brutality—
iufact, the Executive Council seriously considered
the proposal, and came within an ace of accept-
ing it. Finally, however, it was resolved that it
was undignified for the gallows to rush and
gallop and perspire in order to overtake any-
body, and so Fatta Chand is being violently
fed and kept alive by a conference of doctors
that there may be enough of him left to strangle
when the occasion arrives. According to
modern ideas Fatta Chand is to be executed as
a precautionary measure, on the ground that he
will never kill anybody else after he is dead,
and from this point of view it seems to be
nobody’s business how he dies. Also he is to
serve as a warning to others, and his death by
voluntary starvation should be a sufficiently
awful event to warn anybody or anything; in
fact, if it will not fill the bill then capital
punishment is a dead and wretched failure.
And in the third place he must be killed because
the law wants to get level with him for its own
satisfaction, and if his death by hunger won’t
satisfy the law, then that same law is only fit for
a race of ghouls and cannibals, and is totally unfit
for an age of so-called civilisation. Probably,
however, the Government and the Bench and
the hangman are all too thick-headed to reason
these matters out. They have only one idea in
the place which they mistake for their intelli-
gence, and that is that some respectable old
precedent will be burst up if Fatta Chand does
not perish in the orthodox manner ; and Fatta
Chand objects to perishing in the orthodox
manner because he believes that should he do
so, some kind of Asiatic hell will open and take
him in to all eternity. The other parties to the
transaction meanwhile do not care much whether
the wretched Hindoo believes he is going to his
own particular hell or not; they merely want to
hang him and let him go where he may. There-
fore, the race between the man and the gallows
is an exciting one, for the man is running for
his one and only chance of eternal salva-
tion, and the gallows is running for the
preservation of its old, blood-stained tradi-
tions, and its ancient inhumanity, and for
the glorious memories of the hangman and the
soaped noose, and the drop, and the dull, hollow
thud, and the six columns of gory drivel in the
daily papers. If the Governor and the Govern-
ment know even the first rudiments of common
humanity, they can do a. kindly and generous
action by allowing this unhappy Asiatic to
starve in peace ; but then, unhappily, the daily
press makes the Government, and an influential
section of the press has risen up unanimously to
demand its gallows and its “ thud,” and if the
thud isn’t forthcoming there will be trouble at
an early date.
“ The Bulletin ” Refers Back.
Melbourne Age, in a recent leader, had not
only the impudence to brag of its ridiculous
“ Russian scare ” which “ led to the reconstruc-
tion of our defence system,” but the sinful
audacity to declare that it was the first paper
to direct public attention to the Chinese ques-
tion, and so secure Australia to the Australians.
This last assertion will disgust even the “ con-
stant reader ” of the Age, who must know—if
he knows anything—that The Bulletin with
Phil May’s cartoon, an article appearing in
the same issue, and, subsequently, its Anti-
Chinese Number was responsible for the arrest
of the Chow invasion. The Bulletin put its
foot down upon the leper at a time when his
alleged virtues of “industry and thrift” were
catchwords with the Melbourne press. A proof
that The Bulletin then stood alone in fighting
against the yellow disease may be found in a
far back number of the Argus. Not many
months before that stupid old Tory organ veered
round to the popular side it went out of its
lumbering way to sneer at the Anti-Chinese
gospel as “the stock-in-trade of a disreputable
Sydney newspaper. ” Aline which The Bul-
letin is proud to reprint firstly because the
venomous enmity of the Argus carries a com-
pliment with it, and secondly, as a reminder
that the now settled policy of this continent
was originally identified with The Bulletin’s
red cover, and maliciously described as the only
visible means of support of the most widely-
circulated publication in Australia. This para-
graph administers one in the ribs to Argus
stupidity, and a couple of real stingers to the
Age’s lying jaw.
Another Lesson from America.
It should make apathetic Australians blush to
read that there ■was bloodshed at the mayoral
election, in Chicago. Here, as in England,
municipal appointments are left to the manage-
ment of small cliques of shopkeepers, who take
a petty interest in electing the most wind-baggy
councillors they can procure whilst the vast
majority of the ratepayers are content to stand
aside and sneer. The average citizen seems to
find an absurd pleasure in reading of how his
local “ representatives ” have been flourishing
their fat fists at one another, and when they
rest awhile from the usual indulgence in bad
language, he (the average idiot) shakes his sides
over the humorous supposition that “ they’ve
got another blank swindle amongst themselves.”
He delights to amuse his domestic circle with
little things he has just heard concerning the
new Town Hall job, which will saddle posterity
with debt for the next century or so. It
affords him infinite satisfaction to mention
that Fizgig —a man he wouldn’t be seen in a
five-acre paddock with—will soon be sitting on
the Bench, no doubt. In short, the average
citizen makes it his business to assist, by not
voting at all himself, the election of councillors
at whom he can cast contempt. Nothing suits
him better than to call one's attention to the
beastly roads, filthy drains, and bad street-
lighting in his district, and then ask “What
else can be expected from such a crowd as ive’vc
got ?” This lack of interest in local government
was brought out from “home” by our fore-
fathers, and has grown as fast as the geraniums.
Ancient corporations of Hin gland are but very
little more respectable than their offspring, the
Australian councils. The awful reverence with
which distinguished foreigners speak of My Lor’
Mayor of London is a standing joke among the
very Cockneys who could, if they chose, make
his position as honourable in reality as it looks
. on paper.


A Friend of Labour.
Sib Samuel Griffith, a politician who is sup-
posed, by the Conservative press, to be hanging
somewhere on the dizzy brink of Socialism,
Communism, and Anarchy, has just issued
another of these solemn pronouncements by
which he keeps up the hopes of Labour with-
out doing any serious damage to Capital.
ihe statement in question is part of a Bill
or introduction in the Queensland Legis-
lature-one of those “ declaratory measures”
m winch Sir Samuel is accustomed to assert a
principle without any corresponding practice,
and to announce something ought to be done
without doing it. It is a mere abstract moral
observation which is to be solemnly carried
t iiough the usual Parliamentary stages, in the
same manner as the Sermon on the Mount might
be brought in and read a first, second, and
a third time, and duly sanctioned by the Gover-
nor, and embodied in the Statute Book, and
ihen left there to lie forgotten ; and it will do
no good to anybody— except, perhaps, Sir
Samuel Griffith himself. The following is
ilio pompous declaration in question :
OS is'o r, f i. U ‘"‘, an , d Vr T i : nieasln cof ' va ?es is such a sum
uhirh A immediate recompense for the labour for
'hm f PaR ’ regard to its character and
such ris’ii - Ca, l " ever . be Ulk ' n at a less sum than
sue,!! a.-, in sufficient to maintain the labourer and his
family in a state of health and reasonable comfort
Xo more infamous bosh than this was ever
passed on a nation of illiterate cannibals. For
every employer, even though be pays only one
shilling for eighteen hours’ toil, maintains, and
always has maintained, that the shilling is “a
fair and immediate recompense for the labour
for w Inch it is paid,” and as there is nothing in
‘ Sir Griffith’s revolutionary assertion
to contradict him things are left absolutely as
they were. And even if the wages paid will
only supply the labourer and his family
with a leaky pig-sty, and a bed of mouldy
straw, and a dry crust, the employer re-
plies that the pig-sty and the straw and
die crust are reasonable comfort for a labourer ;
and the noble theories of Samuel of Wales say
nothing definite to the contrary. For that
mighty driveller says nothing—absolutely
nothing—that is not already admitted by every-
body ; and he might as reasonably profess to
alleviate human suffering by enacting that no
man s land should be on top of the land of
another man, lest the man underneath should
be damaged while endeavouring to live on his
property, as attempt to reform the earth by
heavy platitudes which come out at the same
hole they went in at. And, moreover, even if
Griffiths unhinged and incapable assertion
meant what it pretends to mean, it is only
commonplace Conservatism at the best. There
18 “natural and proper measure of wages,”
as Mr pAMUEL employs the term, in existence.
There w no “ measure ” of any kind, in fact,
for the only reform which can ever do the world
any permanent good is the abolition of wages,
and the establishment of a co-operative system
under which the community will be every man’s
employer and paymaster. So long as wages last,
they are an unfixable quantity ; their measure
is just as much as the one party is able to get,
and just as little as the other party can manage
to give. Lnder present conditions Premier
Griffith might as well undertake to arbitrate
between the lion and the traveller, and decide
iow much of the latter ought reasonably to be
eaten and how much should be allowed to go
on to its destination. The one question is
quite as capable of being settled by his officious
interference as the other.
Some “ Great Powers.”
Ihe mean and foolish squabble between Italy
and the United States which fills so much space
m the daily papers is growing wearisome. It is
a dismal story of how two of the Great Powers
of the earth howl impotently at each other, and
yet as neither can possibly reach the other they
can only howl and nothing more. The warlike
Australian “loyalist ” whose constant cry of
wailing and lamentation goes up to heaven con-
cerning the horrors of Australian independence
and the annexation of the future Australian
republic by the military nations of Europe, has
here a favourable opportunity to size up the
actual power and value of the typical military
state ; and the party which demands that Aus-
tralia should make a martial exhibition of itself
on the Himalayas, or some other frozen moun-
tain range in Asia, might do well to reconsider
that pompous policy, and recover its second
wind. If Italy, with its army of 860,000 men,
and its ponderous ironclads and its huge re-
serves, should declare war against the United
Mates, it cannot start its troops across the
Atlantic, because its ships can’t carry enough
men to take a tenth-rate American city. It
can t send its fleet there either, because the
(H-eat Power is so hopelessly dead-broke that it
can hardly buy coal, unless Humbert puts
his crown jewels up the Roman spout : and
even if it got the fleet by any means on
the American coast, it might bombard some
city, but if it landed a single man he
would be seized the instant he got ashore,
and made to take shares in a' fraudulent
mining company, and ruined in calls. It can’t
plunder American merchant vessels, either, and
thus make the transaction pay, for America has
no vessels that are worth plundering—in fact
it can do nothing but shake its fist by cable-
gram at the republic, and let things rest. And
on the other hand, the United States, despite
its population of 55,000,000 souls, and its
enormous wealth, can’t invade Italy, for it has
no army, and its navy has a large hole in it and
is covered with barnacles. It might buy a new
navy ready made, but it couldn’t buy men to
work it: and the war would be ancient history
before it had a trained naval force ready. It
can’t plunder Italy’s commerce for there is so
little that it couldn’t be found, and to sum the
whole matter up, the entire Italio-American
quarrel is a hollow thing, and is altogether null
and void, because neither party could commit
enough rapine and bloodshed to disturb the
other, however much it tried. The one nation
lias the largest cash surplus and the other
almost the largest army in the world, and both
rank among the greatest powers on earth, and
jet they could hardly he more impotent if each
iiad only one toothless cripple ami a dog. The
military states of Europe are able to put on
considerable airs so long as they only bang each
other, and if an enemy is near enough to be hit
n ith the thick end of the gun they can do
tremendous damage, but at long range they are
not halt so deadly as an asylum for lost infants.
Ihk situation at present between the Queens-
land shearers and the pastoralists is just this,
the two parties arrived at a mutual agreement
alter an infinity of strife and wrangling, and
now the pastoralists insist on substituting for
u another thing which they also call a “mutual
agreement. Only, as the pastoralists drew up
the new agreement entirely on their own respon-
sibility, and without consulting the men, there
ns nothing “ mutual ” about it. The men
demand the old agreement, and the squatters
reply that the new one is practically the same
as the old, therefore, the men must knock under
iind accept it. The men reply that it is entirely
different, and, therefore, that they will not
accept it. Unless the pastoralists are telling
unmitigated lies, the question naturally arises --
i, * y (I|<l tllc y fight tooth and nail against the
old agreement, seeing it was just the same as
the one which they are now fighting for? And
a ong with this comes another problem—lf
there be no real difference between the two sets
ot regulations, why do the pastoralists fight
now . 1 hey can start any day on the old
system, and if the new system be just the same,
then they have nothing to fight about, and all
the police and soldiers and artillery are sheer
idiocy. Ihe position of the men is intelligible ;
they assert that the agreement which the
pastoralists seek to force upon them involves a
serious loss, and they resist the innovation in
consequence ; but as the squatters declare that
the same innovation brings them no profit, then
they are fighting about nothing, and arguing
about nothing, and trying to grab nothing. And
nhen they aren’t fighting about anything, then
they must be fighting out of sheer cussedness,
and Queensland can’t afford to pay £lOOO a day
m war-expenses for the sake of anybody’s
cussedness. J
Tiie failure of the Victorian loan means one
thing only—the syndicate racket is played out
and A is time to go in for “ freedom of con-
tract. If Australia is ass enough to keep on
borrowing money, and making railway lines
whose one purpose is to buy votes and to boom
up lands belonging to politicians and capitalists,
it is a dead certainty that England is ass enough
to lend it, for England lends money to every-
body—in fact, it once lent money to a country
that didn t exist, and the affable individual who
started the idea skipped with the whole sub-
scription. But hitherto the bonds have been
sold to sundry gangs of hook-nosed financiers,
who bought them up cheap, and then unloaded
on the general public at a big profit, and the
idea of simply selling them over the counter at
the Agent-GeneraTs office to anybody who
wanted them, and trading off one at a time if
necessary never seems to have occurred to any-
body. T here is no earthly necessity for paying
commissions and “ accrued interest ” and other
small swindles, neither is there any need to
watch the market and wait for a ‘ ‘ favourable op-
portunity,” which simply means waiting till the
syndicates see a chance to take in the British
speculator—all that is required is that the safe
m the Agent-General’s office should be strong
enough to hold the unsold bonds securely and
time will do the rest. If the market be weak
the bonds will sell slowly—if it be strong they
will sell rapidly, and in either case the syndi-
cates can be done without. If we want to
save Australia a good many millions we should
instruct the Agents-General to kick or other-
wise insult every banker, big financier, or
syndicate that has hitherto lent money to the
provinces, and thus establish an incurable breach
that will prevent them lending a single cent,
for ever afterwards. Then a new system must
be started or else borrowing must come to an
end, and either of these alternatives would be
an undisguised blessing.
Henniker Heaton was one of the crowd of
lory mediocrities who voted in the Commons
tor the continuance of the brutal and infamous
law by which an Englishman who goes on strike
is liable to be arrested and convicted as a
common felon. An magistrate named Bom-
pas has discovered that if any man leaves his
employment because the hours are too long, or
the wages too low, or because he is required to
do two men’s work for less than one man’s pay,
and incites another man to leave along with
him, they can both be sentenced to a long term
ot imprisonment for conspiracy and also—ye
gods !—for intimidation. The British House of
Commons decided by a solid majority that this
law was a fair and impartial one, and shouldn’t
be altered, and Henniker voted with the
majority. A little later on an attempt was
nuide to interfere with the “liberty of the
subject,” and fool with the great principle of
‘freedom of contract” by prohibiting railway
servants being worked for 14, 16, and even
18 hours a day, and when this proposition was
also violently cast out, Henniker was again
found whooping with the Tory majority. God
bless the representative Australian ! Bless him
tor Ins ungrammatical grovel, and his bull-
headed Toryism, and his other joyous qualities !
Bless him tor his ghastly attempts to look like
a line old English gentleman by helping to grind
the faces of the poor, and by treading with his
big, damp, coarse feet on the hungry ! And
above all things, bless him for going away!
May he be made a duke, and may he also buy a
family seat, so that the Revolution will
know where to look for him at some future day
when it wants him in a hurry; and may ho
always get the advertisement that his soul
craves for, so that the nation may be better
able to identify him when it comes to look for
him.
When the Canadian Premier recently proposed
to despatch delegates to Washington, with
trade reciprocity proposals in view, Secretary
bi.AiNE loftily remarked that he had no objec-
tion to Sir John Macdonald sending over any
number of “ persons ”• to discuss the nn'ual
relations of the two countries, but he coldly
declined to recognise them officially, either as
individuals or as a collective body. He would
not recognise anybody officially as a responsible
negotiator except the British Minister. Here is
a true index of the position of a British colony,
even though it may grandiloquently style itself a
Dominion,” and of the meaning of the term
(( Dependency of Great Britain.” Even an
Australian Federation under the Crown ”
would be cold-shouldered by a practical Ameri-
can Minister, just as France declined recently
to discuss postal treaties with Australian
colonies except through Downing-street. But
the representatives of an “ Australian Republic”
would be received by the American Minister on
terms of equality and with effusive welcome.

Woman, a neat little London paper that wil
make itself among the sex, says that the Piunce
of Wales, “when creating his ‘smart set,’was
doing more injury to this country than was
done to Australia by the ingenious person who
imported rabbits. The rabbits increased and
multiplied, overran the country, destroyed the
crops, and became a. serious epidemic and a
national curse. An epidemic of easy morals,
gambling, tuft-hunting, insincerity, and a
striving after littleness is spreading over Eng
land, and destroying the sense of self-respect
and morality of our upper and middle classes.”
When lovely woman gets these ideas fairly
inside her little head the end of Monarchy will
be at hand.
When treating of the interminable conflicts
between employers and employed the average
press commentator usually winds up his obser-
vations with the regret that the heated dispu-
tants cannot kiss and be friends “as the in-
terests of capital and labour are in reality
identical.' Now, so long as wages are paid and
profits are in vogue it is simply absurd to insist
that Capital and Labour have interests in com-
mon. ihe prosperity of the capitalist lies in
his success to sell for higher than the cost price
the produce of his workmen. The prosperity
of the wage-slave is determinable by the extent
to which he can reduce the discrepancy between
the cost price of his employers’ goods and the
money that person receives for them in the daily
market. The producer claims that he is
entitled to the whole of the fruits of his
exertions, and as he will never be satisfied till
he gets this and nothing less it is simply bare-
faced misrepresentation to assert that Labour
has anything in common with an artificial
system which compels the worker to pay six-
pence for the privilege of obtaining the self-
same article which he made that day with his
own hands for threepence in order that certain
parasites may have an easy time.
Hear Bulletin, The exodus of working
people and small traders from Maoriland still
continues with unabated vigour. I think there
can be little doubt that the success of the
frozen-meat industry, together with the high
price of wool, sufficiently explain the trouble.
Ihe great sheep-farmers are buying out the
agiiculturists right and left, and farms which
formerly employed scores of husbandmen are
now laid down in grass ; sheep have taken the
places of men. The freezing-works only employ
a few hands compared with the farms, and
wages, since the collapse of the strike, have
>een reduced to ss. a day without board, but
w i tii plenty of broken time, the consequence
being that only grown-up lads and young
bachelors can afford to remain at such work
Add to this the fact that the wealthy sheep-
farmers now import nearly all their own stores
flirect from London or elsewhere and have no
need for local shopkeepers, and the departure
of the trading classes is easily accounted for
tntil some sufficient check is placed on the
monopoly of land and the wholesale laying out
of agricultural lands in grass, or until frozen
mutton and wool come down very materially in
price, Maoriland will continue to retrograde in
everything except the accumulation of wealth

Tuesday was celebrated in Melbourne as
Eight Hours Day, and a special feature of the
proceedings was the laying of the foundation-
stone of a memorial intended to monumentalise
the establishment of the Eight Hours’ system in
the colony of Victoria. Mayor Lang had been
selected to lay the .stone, but, it being pointed out
to the Trades Hall Council that he was a member
ot a firm who did not recognise the Eight Hours’
principle, a disagreement arose, and he withdrew
from the function. About GO trades-unions were
represented in the procession, one of the new
appearances being that of the Australian Shearers’

refusing to retain a valuable legacy. A rich local
fruitgrower, Hartmann, died and left his wealth
to the Theosophical Society. Col. Olcott finds
that Hartmanns children are in poor circum-
stances, and at once declares that the spirit of his
Society prevents him from receiving a penny when
that acceptance would injure anyone, and, of his
own free inclination, makes arrangements for
Hartmanns children to receive two-thirds
of the whole legacy—the rest will pro-
bably be mostly swallowed up in expenses.

stereos, whose characters are but replicas. Harry

Nevertheless, listening to the old wheezes
that the habitue can foresee ten seconds before
they re cackled, one begins to think that British
melodramatic originality expired with the once
inuch-under-rated adapter, Dion Boucicault.
Bland, not content with his fat as the wide-awake
money-lender, pads it out with A idisher slang
most of which on first night was Greek to the
multitude, though a reference to a moshkin- shop
threw at least a third of the circle into convul-
sions. Baker, contrary to the usual practice of
the dough-kneading profession, doesn’t use much
of the potato in compounding his Chicago Irish-
man, who is more closely akin to a Yorkshireman,
but on the whole, a polyglottish sort of party!
In the cabby, H. R. Roberts has a part that would
run alone without a license, quite as good as
Bland s and more easily played. The young actor
doesn t make the most of it, and works it
on exactly similar lines to those of other
parts he- has recently handled. Augustus
Glover plays a haughty patrician of the variety
that fondly imagines no dress-suit is complete with-
out a red silk handkerchief tucked in its shirt-
bosom and Albert Norman's villain is more Italian
than 1 renoh, though not particularly wedded to
any nationality. J. P. West plays Marks, the
would-be virtuous solicitor, whose feet have grown
laige in the hunt for ’oof, as if he were really
aweary of this wicked world. The Violet Chester
of Kate Bishop is sweet and sympathetic, and
v\ alter Howe, the Chester protector, plays with
more fire and ease than usual. Virgy Vivienne
is bright and easy, and all the other people are
fairly good. “London, ’ etc., is a kaleidoscope
in eleven scenes, which fails to clearly carry on
its story, chiefly because its characters are con-
tinually being shaken up before they’ve had time
to settle down. But as it contains only one
murder, no big sensation, few tears, and is full of
funny business, it would probably be popular
for even a longer period than the‘management
will be able to house it. The show’s best features
to our mind, are the scenery and the changes made
with the lights up in full view of the house. In
the first scene, for instance, the flat that forms
the wall of an office falls forward and discloses, on
its hitherto-hidden side, a garden-fence, flower
beds, &c., and, beyond, a rustic, red-tiled cot.
aiu scene, with a view of the
Alhambra, aglow with gas, is also good, but the gem
is a view of the Thames, that is almost too lovely.

Sydney Criterion management, recog-
nising that the booting of dead dogs is an
unprofitable occupation, will be quite satisfied to
a l( v ™ y o ne - f run oufc ? f “ The Colonel,” which,
like llie benous family ’ and one or two other
plays, is adapted from “ Le Mari a la Campagne”
of Bayard. It has been previously played in
Sydney by Wybert Reeve, and, we think, on
another occasion by Harkins, an American actor
ot some ability, but the .esthetic craze never was
very deeply rooted in Australian soil, and so the
satire at no time was very apparent nor the
play very, popular. As now played at
Sydney Criterion all seem agreed that Geo.
iitheradge, for once, has missed fire. He
doesn’t dress or make up his Colonel Wootwell
VV. Woodd properly, and his accent is more sug-
gestive of Dublin than Boston. His humour
lacks dryness and he, too evidently, enjoys his
own sallies. Brough is also a comparative failure
he is too hard in style, too incisive, long to sustain
the w-jird woe-begoneness of the apostle of irides-
cent ilhmitability. In fact, when Lambert Streyke
spoke of the beauty of the inexpressible ” people
m front thought he was gagging about his own
wnnkly and .baggy pants and laucrhed con-
sumedly. Cecil Ward has the straightest part in
the cast, one that could be walked through with-
out much trouble. He gets every ounce out of it,
however, but has previously done much better
work and got far poorer notices. Arthur
Lawrence-he looks like Bellew run into
flesh has little to do but attitudinise
and look ovely. He doth. Miss Romer’s
Cady iompkins is a clever impersonation of the
woman willing to deceive and willingly deceived
who fain would float into society on the bosom of
a reigning craze. In the Olive of Emma Temple
are accurately depicted the angularity and flatness,
the imp asceticism and pallor of the ideal {esthete.
iruJy such Olives are an acquired taste. Mrs
Brough was never seen to greater advantage, and
her reconciliation scene with Titheradgef albeit
he got right away from the Yank, was the best
thing on first night. The “ Colonel ” only plays
two hours at most, and badly wants bolstering up
wHh a curtam-raiser. He is now taking money
under false pretences, for lots of folks, patriotically
moved, are going to see the Colonial, and coming
away puzzled to understand why there’s not a
word about Australia m it. “Modern Wives,”
the three-act comedy by Ernest Warren, which
concluded the company’s Brisbane season, takes
the floor on Saturday next for six nights only.

At Sydney Garrick the “ Widdy ” is in

on Inin, door, robe dc unit, and all, gets a howl

tions, Herr Pechotsch will be on hand with his
violin, and Miss Naylor will lend her gracious
presence and technical skill as accompanist. W.

who has gone ahead to Melbourne.

At Coogee Aquarium, Manager Larmour
declares that he is weary of the whims and fancies
of pugilists who, “reared in a humpy and on
damper fed,” want the whole Aquarium hung up
for a cronk set-to. In future he intends to do
without them rather than be done by them, as
soon as the Griflo-Murphy match for £lOO purse,
now definitely settled ail but the date, is over.

At Bondi, the Edison Phonograph, brought
from America by Mr. Garland, is on show. The
Aquarium is for sale by order of the mortgagees—
everything in a lump, including Wyburd, who is
a fixture and one of the chief attractions,

Miss Frances Saville, whose portrait
we give elsewhere, and who with her hus-
band, Mr. Max Rown, sailed for Europe
in the Parramatta, is the daughter of
Martin Simonsen, the well-known violinist and
entrepreneur, and Mine. Fanny Simonsen, the
greatest Maritana of the Australian stage.
Francesca Simonsen was born at ’Frisco and
educated at Hamburg. On arriving in Australia
she toured in English, Italian and comic opera,
and finally settled down in Sydney as platform
singer, in 1885. Since then she has been the
soprano of all the principal oratorios, has assisted
Santley, the Halles and other important musi-
cians in their Australian appearances, and was
specially engaged to create the name part in
“Marjorie” during its production in Melbourne.
Mrs. Rown informs us that she intends to hear all
the European vocalists who are worth hearing,
and will probably visit Marches!, ere making any
professional appearance in Europe.

“The Schoolmistress,” having brought
V T ere and the vexing girls overland from Sydney,
re-established her seminary at Melbourne Bijou
un Saturday, when “House full’’was hung out-
side the front-door for the first time these many
weeks. People who remember Minnie Palmer’s
murderous attack upon Pinero’s farce at the
original Bijou will think better of the present
performance than those who now see it for the
first time. The monstrous interpolation of a song
and dance by Peggy and Vere Queckett, in the
second act, used to bring the show into contempt.
By comparison with that music-hall incident the
rehearsal given by Mistress Maggie Moore to the
“comic-oratorio ” composer is first-class business,
albeit the old favourite sang a poor selection of
ditties (including “ Annie Rooney ”) much below
her best form on Saturday. Take it altogether,
however, “ The Schoolmistress ” fell unexpectedly
flat. The natural difficulties which beset
Maggie Moore in the name part were made
especially evident by her nervousness and
newness to her surroundings. Probably she
has never been less at home on any
stage. For the rest, matters are much the
same as in Sydney, the substitution of Annie
Taylor (bright and humorous, as usual) for Miss
Roraer being the one noticeable change. Anson
again works hard to enlarge his small part, Percy
Lyndal and Clitheroe still follow the flag, while
Boucicault and Pattie Browne continue to enjoy
most of the fat. The manager’s conception of
vere Queckett will strike Melbourne folks as being
across between his Beau Farintosh and the Polish
Srinceof “Glass and Fashion.” And those who saw
linnie Palmer play Peggy will surely regret that
Miss Pattie took the Mellikan gal’s exaggerations
so much to heart. She even fixes her hair up in a
ridiculous fashion for no better reason, seemingly,
than that Minnie gave her the idea.

There was a numerous attendance at the
Royal to welcome George Darrell’s “ seventh pro-
duction” of “Transported for Life.” The hand
°f time touches George very gently, especially
about the legs, and as he stands, or sits (George
has a genius for arranging himself on tree-stumps,
®."°-) in the centre of the stage, and breathes
through his revered foghorn, he is exactly the
same as of yore. Neither does his play seem a
day older than it did at its first production, long
ago, for George’s disquisitions on the ways of men,
tunny stage gags and general dramatic effects
were pretty well petrified before he slung them
together. George’s dislike lor the “get-up” of
ordinary humanity seems to grow upon him, and
at whatever moment you drop into the Royal the
spectacle of a vestless hero wrestling with
adversity is right there. But it may be
necessary for George to furnish an everlasting
front view of his shirt. Perhaps his
mighty heart would burst a waistcoat if
he put one on. “ Transported for Life,”
is one of the author’s most aggravating efforts,
insofar that George’s main purpose is to per-
-BUil.d® ie audience that he must have suffered
a v 10 l en * ; death, and then to destroy their dream of
happiness by emerging from a shaft-hole, or
ascending from the depths of the ocean with a
proud smile playing round his teeth. Not until
he leads himself to slaughter early in the first act
, tiu 0 -Darrell figure in one of his own
dramas with gratifying success. Several people
beside George— not reckoning critics who are
dieinselves-participate in this entertain-
ment. Mrs. Darrell, rapidly becoming moulded
to her husband’s “style,” gets some long speeches
and a few st strea £ B ’ o{ li mel i g ht. Oily Deering
looks after the antique wheezes, H. Shine intro
duces an accepfca ble song and grotesque body
movements , an ‘ d Jenny Bryces Irish brogue lends
an air of nature to the show. Some of the others
oall aloud for d annihilation) b ut the scenery
fmd George’s stage management are effective. The
big ship which bears down upon Mr. and Mrs. D.
when they are floating on a life-belt, is the same
? seaworthy vessel that has done duty before

Thanks to Elton and the ballet, “The Old
Guard ” has caught on at the Princess’. On the
tbird nig ] lt litt f e William brought Miss Marie
Keddall forward in her walking costume, to
reeeive the applause due to the designer of a
dance so eminently calculated to drive Melbourne
crazy, and now that clever lady always appears
after her “ royal ballerinas ” have been encored to
exhaustion. It is a pretty dance, telling its own
spicy little story. Some of the ballerinas figure
as boys in satin suits, whilst others are girls in
longish skirts. The orchestra excites the girls to
wild can-can kicks, and lures them on to run
round in a ring, grabbing one another by the ankle
as they go, until a fresh strain of music restores
them to a proper sense of modesty, and makes ’em
feel sorry for having flourished their anatomy in
the air without cons’dering that their mothers
might t approve . So they blush gracefully, and
exit with their faces averted from their natural
enemies. After an encore, it is the boys who pro-
fess to be shocked by what took place, leaving one
to assume that the satin-suited ballerinas are mem-
bers of the Y.M.C.A
out on the loose
Seldom is such a
touching moral lesson
attached to a comic
opera, and the pro-
spect of “The Old
Guard ” running to
great business is,
from a religious
standpoint, extremely
comforting.

At the Alexandra
matters are progres-
s:ng evenly. The
Shakespearean Fri-
days started in pro-
mising style last week
with ‘As You Like
It, ’ and, as a large
audience did like it,
the same bill is pro-
mised for to-morrow
(24th) a few re-
in arks on Lily
Dam pier’s taking per-
formance of Rosalind
being reserved for
fur herconsideration.
“ The Wages of Sin,”
put up on Saturday,
is sure of an uproari-
ous reception for the
five nights of its stay,
because the company
are well placed in
Harvey’s drama.
Dampier can imper-
sonate a virtuous
parson as well as any
actor in this wicked
world, and Mrs. D,
is always amusing in
her particular line of
genteel broad-comedy
This Saturday they
revive the “Courier
of Lyons,” which
grand old play has
not been played in
the city for a long
while.
“ Falka ” will come to a somewhat sad end
at the Opera House, on Friday, and with it there
will be a strange cutting-short of the Clara
Merivale season. Whether Miss Clara and her
new operas are postponed for a definite or in-
definite period has not yet been announced. Any-
way, the theatre closed on Saturday for a full
rehearsal of “Evangeline,” an “American
romantic burlesque ” of apparent celebrity in its
native land. This novelty will be submitted to
Australian notice on Monday. The composer,
Edward Rice, has come over with six members of
the Yankee company, and if these are as smart as
some of the resident artists—Snazelle, Gourlay,
Forde, Hodson, Fannie Liddiard and others—
engaged to support them, there should be no diffi-
culty in making the romantic burlesque hum.

Carver’s Wild West Show lassooed a few
thousand into the Frb ndly Societies’ Gardens on
Saturday, and the halls are still prospering.
Hopetoun has heaped distinction upon the Wax-
works by going to see that wild delusion, the
Fighting Kangaroo, and the Cyclorama continues
to thrive on the two shilling ticket. But things
are rather dull and lonesome at the Aquarium
since the alligator died, and the Fitzroy neigh-
bourhood wants its Baby-Show badly.
*« * *
“Our Flat,” recently produced at Ade-
laide Theatre Royal, is rather disappointing. The
first act drags and the second is the sole saviour
of the piece which relapses in the concluding act
so badly that you leave “ Our Flat ’’ hurriedly to
seek lodgings more congenial. A young dramatist
who has eloped with his wife to “Our Flat”
writes tragedies with situations “strong enough
to raise hairs on an eggshell,” which are all it
turned. The father-in-law, visiting the flat to sec
his daughter, is mistaken for a money-lender,
with the result that he is persuaded to let his son-
in-law have £l6. Fresh oomplifcatio’ne, hbwevcr„
arise and the author’s furniture is seized for debt,
whereupon his wife, aided by drapery, transforms
old boxes, boards, towel-horse, a hip-bath, cook-
ing utensils, &c., into articles of furniture. She
also writes a farcical comi ily entitled “ Near the
Wind,” which is acceptu t by the managers of the
Star Theatre for £2OO. Then the old man relents,
and takes his children to his arms : Tableau and
curtain. Polly Emery, as the slavey, has the fat
of the piece, and scores every point. As the
dramatic author Robert Inman was natural and
easy. E. W. Royce, wonderfully made up as the
theatrical lessee and owner of an irritating snort,
had but little to do except sit down on the bogus
furniture with unhappy results. Harry Diver, as
the artist, and Edwin Kelly, as the father-in-law,
were all right. Myra Kemble, although imper-
fect in text, was otherwise a satisfactory Mrs.
Sylvester. Business has been big. The Nether-
sole-Cartwright company opened with “The
Idler ” on Wednesday evening.

A private performance of ‘ ‘ The Gondol-
iers,” given at Windsor Castle last month, would
scarcely keep Victoria Regina laughing all the
time. The Republican Royalty which Gilbert
pokes genial fun at is merely one of his topsy-
turvy notions, and the moral which ponderous
“loyalists” have drawn from the court of
Barataria is ridiculously false. On the other
hand there is a sting in many of the librettist’s
radical lines, and genuine satire both in his con-
ception of the Duke of Plaza-Toro (floated into a
limited company for the benefit of Snobocracy)
and his picture of the Duke’s haughty daughters
secretly carrying-on with the family flunkey.
Moreover, the lesson of the opera is not so much
that the Gondoliers are ready to start as re-
publican kings, as that their wives are madly
anxious to sit on a golden throne and put on
“ jam.”
Burdekin says that the N.S.W. Freetrade
Party will fight hard against the Commonwealth
Bill. Quite right. It is designed to murder them.
Cornelius Bourke, crank, aged seventy
something, who kicked his vagrant cell-mate to
death at Hamilton gaol, lias been hanged. The
only moral deducible from Bourke’s execution is
that he had bad luck in being transported from
England to the Vandemonian hell for stealing
six pounds of beef when he was a boy. That’s all.
When standing on the trap he exclaimed, “You
are choking me.” “Yes” replied the hangman,
“ you have just struck it.” At least that’s what
any hangman would have said Avho was reasonably
ready with his tongue.

Mr. J. J. Doyer, late of the Adrian Hotel,
Amsterdam, has opened a Bodega at Glasgow
Arms, George-street, Sydney, in the Continental
style.
Barrister Costello, whom Judge Harding
put under arrest for five minutes the other
day for “ contempt,” is the man who most deter-
minedly fought against all the prejudices of the
Full Supreme Court, the Law Examiners, the
Law Society, &c., until he forced them to admit
him to the Queensland Bar—a dead set having
been made against him on account of some sup-
posed slur on his moral character relating to the
time when he was in the Education Department.
The judges refused him again and again, but he
came up smiling, and eventually beat all the legal
talent pitted against him.
At Palmerston, Northern Territory, Gov.
Kintore, the overland processionist, distinctly
advocated the employment of yellow and black
labour for tropical agriculture, and berated
Queensland anti-coolie legislation. This is a sam-
ple of the nickel-plated cheek common to out-
siders whose sympathies cannot embrace any
purely Australian sentiment. Who is Governor
Kintore, apart from his reflected plumage of a
Royalty that is daily becoming more distasteful
to the democracy of this continent, that he should
presume to settle the colour question whicli Aus-
tralia has already decided for itself? So long as
Governors confine themselves to windy efforts
born of gaseous wines, and to ornamental func-
tions that tickle the petty vanity of a few silly
peacocks, this democracy can afford to shrug its
broad shoulders with a smile, and await more
useful times ; but when they speak and act as if
they were secret touts and interested agents for
l lie British money-shark and the absentee blood-
leech, The Bulletin’s advice to them is to clear
out of Australia before they are fired out. When
a Kintore can settle the labour question for Aus-
tralia., the GoVernof .-General Will be a nig.

The English snobocracy was, at latest dates, agitated
by report that the Queen may possibly go to see “ Ivan-
hoe,” at the new Opera House.
A recent unsuccessful revival of “The Stranger” at
the London Olympic is another reminder that the old
style of play is no good without the old style of players.
O’Grady, who produced “The Famine” at Melbourne
Royal, a few' months ago, has been advertising some
vicious nonsense in London Bra. Amongst other dis-
jointed remarks, he says that “the Firm” supplied him
with a rotten company, and the press was “ paralysed”—
probably because it was for once unanimous in damning
the man s literary effort. As for the support, O’Grady
certainly did tell them at rehearsal that he could get a
better company for £lO a week in dear old England.
Whereupon Clyndes suggested that he ought to hire a
company good enough for hit plays at ten “bob” a week.
But O’Grady doesn’t put that down in the advt. “ for fear
he might forget it.”
Sala seems to have “struck it” this time, for American
papers say—“ The body of the petrified man lately found
under his auspices in Fresno, California, has been sold to
a showman for £2500. Apropos, Sala is said to have
traded off the N.S. Wales marble-man for £l4uo ! When
last heard of, the latter interesting curiosity was in the
possession of Mr. W. F. Buchanan, the opulent squatter,
who didn’t seem overjoyed about the fact. Where is the
“Man” now?
Fuller Maitland, musical critic of London Times, gets
£450 a year and 7s. 6d. for every concert he attends.
Margaret Mather, the actress, recently left her husband
after two or three years of married life. Her reason was:
“ I discovered I’d made a mistake in marrying.” Mar-
garet was free to follow her own dictates, because she can
earn a handsome living for herself. When women can
earn a living as readily as men divorce will be as easy as
marriage.
The Taylor-Carrington Dramatic Company have been
doing very fine business in West Australia.
Madame Patey sings with Sydney Philharmonic on
return from her Eastern tour.
The Majeroni benefit promises to be a bumper. Dr
Burne is treasurer, L. J. Lohr and C. R. Bailey, joint sec-
retaries, and the ben, will probably take the form of a
matinge on AVednesday, May 6, at Sydney Her Majesty’s.
Harry Rickards, who sailed in the Alameda on Monday,
plays for one night only in Honolulu. He has also made
American “dates.”
Horace Chester, mimic and single-handed entertainer,
has arrived in the Britannia under engagement to His
cocks and Wilson.
Mary Anderson (Mrs. Navarro) has sold all her stage
properties, scenery, and costumes.
Someone writes to enquire if John L. Toole ever acted
in “ Fun on the Bristol.” Never to our knowledge, and
it is most improbable that he ever did, under any circum-
stances. He couldn’t play the “Widely,” and personally
is no leg-show.
Emilie Melville and \ r erdi are playing grand opera at
Johannesburg.
Hubert O’Grady is coming out to Australian again. He
says: “ Begorras it’s meself knows what’ll plaze (him
this toime.” Hubert has a good opinion of himself.
John Billington, interviewed in London by Ithuriel,
speaks highly of the Australian stage, climate, and
hospitality. He has re-christened the country “Brighter
Britain.”
Walter Bentley, who contemplates visiting Australia,
will re-appear at an early date with a new play in
London.
The South American impresarios, Chacchi and Duccb
have, it is said, offered Patti £30,000 and expenses for 20
operatic performances !
A Thames man offers Te Kooti £5OO a year to show

The Collet-Dobson-Kennedy Dramatic Company are
doing splendid business in New Zealand with “The
Shaughraun,” “ Little Lord Fauntleroy,” and “The
Ticket-of-Leave Man.”
The Gerald-Duff Company have just concluded the
most successful dramatic season ever known at Broken
Hill.
Misled by ill-worded paragraphs in the dailies, The
Bulletin was led to believe that M. Guilmant, the
eminent French organist, was either in, or on bis way to,
Australia. Now, it seems that he is in Paris, and could
not arrive until about the same time as M. Weigand, the
player appointed by the Sydney Council. Under the
circumstances, the Council could not well entertain the
application of M. Guilmant’s agents.
In Charles Arnold’s new play, with which he is stump-
ing the English provinces, he shears a sheep, in full sight
of the audience, inside seven minutes with (we won’t
advertise it) ’s patent shearing-machine. What the
stage wants is a patent for shearing the public or fleecing
boarding-house keepers.
When in Dunedin Johnny Toole bought a photo, of a
Maori man and woman staiiding up to the waist in the
water of the Pink Terrace bath. Then he got photoed.
naked to the waist, stuck the head and shoulders between
the coppery pair, got the lot re-photographed and sent
copies home to Irving and other Hinglish friends.
It is not deemed good business for a fasting-man to be
seen picking his teeth.
Sydney Criterion benefit for the widow and children of
John Miisgrave was a success in every way. Manager
Magee tells us that about £l7O were taken. As the
expenses were very light, the family will derive substan-
tial benefit.
Sydney Criterion will be closed in June for alterations,
whi h will cost £BOOO. Increased space in circle, upper
circle, and stalls will grant 400 additional seats ; the elec-
tric-light and a sliding-roof will be put in, a promenade
thrown out for dress-circle, the paint-room greatly-
enlarged, dressing-rooms improved, and the stage depth
doubled.
The Indian Planters’ Gazette devotes several columns
to eulogising Mrs. Potter, whom it enthusiastically styles
“ Our Cora.” The old story ; the callow critic is an easy
prey to the artful actress. Manager Twinning is still in
advance.
Barry Sullivan is once more reported dying. Apropot,
we wonder what became of Miss K—?, who went to
England a few days before Sullivan left Melbourne, also
for the old country ? Had old A K—— caught the
distinguished tragedian then, there might have been no
Barry Sullivan for the last 20 years.
A potter, remarks a Bulletin correspondent, would not
think of burning his ware on a sieve with wooden rims,
but Mr. Cartwright, at Melbourne Royal, did so in “The
Middleman,” and Miss Nethersole wears what looks like
the same white dress in three acts in “Moths,” and com-
plains bitterly, in the last act, of the cold, while all the
other actors and actresses are wrapped up in overcoats,
furs, gloves, and top-boots. This is not so bad as the
actor in “Green Lanes of England,” who would persist in
striking bis matches on the sole of his boot in the snow-
storm scene.
Positively the funniest thing ever you heard. The late
King of Prussia and Baron Seidelwitz were desperate
admirers of Cerito, nicknamed Cherrytoes, the danseuse,
and viewed her performances together from a side box,
being so delighted that they got up, shook hands, and
embraced each other ! Hard lines.
Mr. AY. S. Medcalfc, who, in days gone by, acted as

street, Sydney.

Gibsen into something more original.)
BY EDMUND FISHER.
CHARACTERS:
Hellmore, Hsq. —A Weak-minded husband-.
Grogstate. — A Guy Fa wkes plotter.
Dr. Keank.— A man who doesn't feel veil-.
Bora—Hellmoee’s missus-.
Servants, Children and fittings.
ACT I.
Scene.—A front-parlour in Norway-.
(Hellmore discovered fighting for almond-rock
with two, chubby offspring, Who ultimately come
off Second and third best.)
HELtikOBE—There! Papa has won, my little
swe'ets.
Children—Papa has won our little Sweets, you
nieari.
Hellmore— ,tust so, darlings, and Pm puttillg
then! away (with his monthfn/l)-. The main
dbject of this act is td show how inanely
happy and simple I aim The fact could be
blade clear in,three minutes, but the hew
philosophy makes it spread river one solid
half-liour; Observe how light-hearted I aim
Nobody would think 1 Was the father of two
bhildteil; and had to mend their clothes. I’ll
jump On to the Sofa (jumps). No v I’ll jump
bff again (does s6). Ain’t I acting natural ?
Ndw I’ll blow my nose and pick my teeth, just
as people dri in real life. Gibsen’s method is
to lay bare all the workings of the human
mind, with the calm deliberation of a funeral;
tiniLDREN [to 6m. another)— The stalls ate getting
testless.
(Enter servant with large band-box.)
Servant—Here’s the suit and burnt cork what
missus ordered for you to go to the fancy-
dress ball in;
Hellmore—l’m happiei
than ever. Are the
bones (w avi n g his
hands like a corner-
man) there ?
Servant—At the bottom
of the box. (Exit).
Hellmore—Hush ! t
hear Mamma coming
—let ns all hide in
the coal-scuttle;
(They bury their heads
among the coke.)
(Enter Bora in blue spec-
tacles, with Dr,
Krank.)
Bora Now, where is
my little doggie
hiding ? Ah, there
they are (draws
Krank’s attention to
the protruding bodies
and limbs, whereupon
the family vnthdraw
their faces from the
scuttle and dance for
Joy.) I hope my
ownest has not been
exciting himself too
much. (Kisses Hell-
more and children.)
Excitement is bad
for doggie, isn’t it,
doctor ?
Krank (moodily) —Not so bad as an incurable
disease quartered on the ancestral escutcheon.
It’s a great moral lesson to see me suffer, you
know.
Bora —Poor fellow ! I’m going back again to the
shop, and will stand you a. seidlitz-powder en
route. (Exit both, kissing hands to Hellmore.)
Hellmore—l feel the premonitory symptoms of a
revolution in my character. " No matter; I
will continue to fool with the kids. Come,
darlings, let us crawl under the table. (They
crawl their.)
Enter Grogstate.
Grogstate—Nobody here—then I must dissem-
ble.
Hellmore (emerging from place of concealment ) —
Oh! it’s you fin harsh, rusty-hingc accents).
What do you want ?
Grogstate—Are we alone? I wish to raise a
storm in a teapot.
Hellmore (pouting) —Runoff, darlings, while I
converse with this black-beetle. (Picks up
children gaily, and drops ’em outside oh mat.)
Now, what is your business?
Grogstate—Humph! Four years ago I lent you
£5 to buy your wife a scarf-pin. You gave
tne a receipted hotel-bill as security. You
have not forgotten ? (Smiles ominously.)
Hellmore (taking peppermint-drop from his
trousers pocket) —Well, what of that?
Grogstate (relentlessly) —Are you, then, ignorant
of the fact that among the items charged upon
that bill was a shilling for two cigars ?
Hell more (letting peppermint-drop fall from his
lips) —Go on.
Grogstate—Must I remind you that your wife
has a deep-rooted objection to smoking? You
promised her, before marriage, never to smoke
yourself, nor to be accessory to the blowing of
a cloud. All Norway knows of your oath.
Hellmore—l begin to understand. My face
changes colour, and my friskiness is slowly
deserting me in this hour of need.
Grogstate —What would the consequences be it
I published your shame abroad ?
Hellmore—Pshaw ! The cigars were to save the
life of my uncle who was suffering from
asthma. He smoked one, I the other. All
the doctors watching said : “ You must smoke
or he will die.” ’Twas but a venial offence-.
Grogstate—Listen to me. I’ve been working as
handy-man in your wife’s bonnet-shop for
many years, and now that she has become a
partner in the business I shall get the sack.
My situation is everything to me—screw,
honour-, respect, perhaps fame. A word from
you would keep me in my position. Speak it
and I will burn that hotel bill in a public bon-
fire. If not I will send yorir wife a letter dis-
closing all. If lamto be cast forth into the
glitter, J will drag you with me, down, dowh,
down.
Hellmore—t don’t consent, but I’ll do my best.
Now, go. (Exit Grog.) I’ll send for six-

Bora—My oWri doggie looks qhi to graVe. ( Kisses)-.
Hellmore—Don’t discharge Grogstate. He’s
an excellent window-cleaner and a roost riiys-
terioris sort of main The audiehce like him

in ordinary society. Keep him arid give him

SHEARER : “Why, don't you see, if I swear in the shed
I'm fined 10s., so I went outside.”
man must certainly go.
Hellmore (anxiously) —But he will starve in the
gutter. When a Norwegian loses one billet
ho can never hope to get another, but is
doomed to expire in the open drain. (Aside)
—And if Grog state falls I shall be dragged
down, down, down.
Bora—My mind is made up. No man who once
perverted the truth shall pollute my presence.
I might bring home the infection in my
clothes and spread it around my family circle.
(Sits down and vrites a week’s notice for
Grogstate. )
Hellmore (looking weird) —Does every father
transmit falsehood and prevarication in the
direct line ?
Bora—He do. Gibsen was the first man to dis-
cover the law of hereditament and moral con-
tagion. (Exit Bora, snuffling.)
(Hellmore, left alone on the stage, spends five
minutes in making himself a psychological
study. En ter servant with children. )
Servant—Here they are, mum; they want you
to crawl up the chimney.
Hellmore (wildly) —The children—contact with
deceitful parent—laws of Gibsen 1 O lor!
(Children approach.) Stand back—don’t
touch me ! I’m awakening. 0! take ’em
away—take ’em away. (Falls weeping on the
fender.)
Servant (removing infants) —Take ’em away, in-
deed ! He must have got ’em again; thinks
the little hinnercents are snakes. (Exit.)

Scene.—The front parlour again.
(Hellmore discovered looking pale and thoughtful
over the new philosophy. Lumps of almond-
rock lie neglected upon the mantelshelf.)
Hellmore fsoliloquises) —I haven’t dared to look
at the children since yesterday. They cried
for me to wish them good night, but I let
them yell. There is poison in my kiss, and
the man who would wilfully innoeulate his
offspring with the bacteria of one broken
Commandment is hateful in Gibsen’s sight.
When my wife asked me to nurse the baby
for three hours, I pleaded a headache. I

more wearisome than ever. Ha ! Who’s
there?
Enter Grogstate.
Grogstate—The blow has fallen, and my notice
to quit is in my boot. Will yon speak the
word that shall restore me to my old position
of trust ?
Hellmore—l have done my best; you must do
your worst.
Grogstate—Think what the exposure will cost
you. In any sensible community it wouldn’t
make twopenn’orth of difference, but here, in
the land of Gibsen, the story of those illicit
Manillas must blight your youth like a
pestilence, and blot you out for never. You
see this letter ? — (holding out hit of brown
paper). Presently I shall walk round and
drop it in yonder letter-box; then we shall
both crumple-up in the gutter. (Exit,
sneering.)
Hellmore—Gracious Ivins ! I feel the mi facie
coming on. Let me indulge in another long
dose of facial expression.
(Ente 1 )' Dr. Krank— polite salutations.)
Krank—Well, my dear friend, I’m going away to
expire. That incurable disease, which is my
ohly reason fot being ih the play, has brought
me within 8| days of my latter end. I am
the virtuous victim of the sins of my great-
grandfather; Incurable diseases are peculiar
to Norway, ahd Gibsen is their prophet. Yes,
I am going away to yield Up my gruesome
ghost. I’ve had a kennel built in the middle
Df a pine-forest, and I shall crawl inside the
cool retreat and die like a dawg. I’m an in-
curable nuisance.
Hellmore (cheerfully) —ls there no hope ?
Krank—Notie whatever; I’ve takeii Rough on
Rats to no purpose. I’ve been to L. L.
Smith, but his skill was powerless against the
sins of my great-grandpapa. As a last
resource he sang “ God Save the Qtieen ”

Worse. If you want a friend when I’m gone,

guilt Of. my ancestor arid acting as a moral
lesson. Farewell. (Exit Krank to die. )
Hellmore—Then I shall never hear his cheerful

Hellmore {move excited them evc/j —Yes, marma-
lade ; you promised me a pot.
Bora—Well, well, I suppose doggie must be

(Hellmore seizes her ear and runs off.)
(Enter Servant.)
Servant—Master’s a deep ’an. I seen him kissing
the girl next door over the garden wall, and
when he noticed as I spotted his little game
he give me five shillings, and told me to hold
my tongue about the miracle. Some people
ought to be ashamed of theirselves. But soft,
I hear footsteps deproaching.
(Enter Hellmore a nd Bora, after lapse of three
minutes for luncheon.)
Bora— Now my little doggie must perform,
(Letter is dropped into box with sickening thud,
as though weighted by a stone.) Ha! I will
read my correspondence first,
Hellmore (wildly) —Not yet; never mind your
letters. (Does step-dance in front of box.)
Don’t hurry on the miracle by reading 1 stupid
letters. I will do the can-can . ( Rushes to
mantelshelf and takes castanets, which he
rattles violently while throwing up his legs. His
delirium spreads to Bora and the Servant,
and soon everybody is whirling madly in all
directions.)

ACT 111.
Scene.—Same old Front Parlour.
Time : Two a .m.
Enter Hellmore in striped pyjamas and a black
face, with hones stick mg out of his trousers
pocket, and Bora, attired as a ballet girl.)
Bora—My doggie must be weary after his brilliant
pas de seal at the ball. He must sit down
and chew lollies, while I read my letters
(takes bunch oj keys and advances towards
box).
Hellmore (jumping up in alarm)— Don’t trouble
about business to-night. Come and talk about
the miracle which is hanging over ns.
Bora—Absurd doggie! But I suppose I must
humour him for five minutes, and then to
peruse the epistles.
Hellmore (i talking rapidly) —All right—five
minutes. Let us talk about something lively.
Poor Dr. Krank has gone into a kennel to
die. He suffers, as you know, from an in-
curable disease, and expects to pop off pre-
sently in great agony, I suppose it can’t be
helped.
Bora —No, Krank is merely obeying the laws of
Nature, which only Gibsen knows anything
about. I trust he will make a satisfactory
corpse. Now to read my letters.
[Slow music, ichilc Bora takes letters from box
and retires into hack parlour.)
Hellmore—l must sit here and pour tray emotions
until she comes back.
(Enter Bora at full gallop, her hair standing on
end. She points to open letter in her left hand. )
Bora —What do I see, Mr. Hellmore ! lam dis-
graced, ruined, burst-up—l who have held my
head so high, and always said my prayers
reg’ler. It is bad enough to know that I have
taken a flat-sided hunk of deceit to my chest
and allowed my children to call him father;
but what was that compared with the public
shame of the exposure that threatens me ?
Hellmore (in harsh, cold accents) — I bought
those cigars to save my asthmatical uncle —
to save the life of mother’s brother. I would
have confessed all long ago, and have got the
matter oyer with a commonplace row, ter-
minating in tears and forgiveness, but I Vvas
. afraid. Something told me there was a
miracle attaching to those two “smokes.”
Bora ( savagely) —Yes, yes; but how came you to
place yourself in this man’s power? Fool,
idiot) dolt! O, Jehoshophat! I’m clean
done! lam a moral wreck oh the rock of
Mrs. Grundy.
Hellmore ( stonily) — I never anticipated events.
I thought of nothing but hardbake in those
days. Why did you make me a mere India-
rubber doll ?
(Another thud is heard in the letter-box. Bora
nervously unlocks little door, takes out letter,
breaks seal —slow music all this time—and
gradually relaxes into an oily, objectionable
grin.)
Bora. —What’s this! Why, my own, dearest
little doggie, it’s all as right as ninepence.
Look up at your hivin’ old ’ooman and rejoice.
Grogstatß sends me back the bill, because
Mrs, Laudem—a lady we have left out of this
revised edition of Gibsen —has consented to
marry him and keep him from the gutter, on
the condition that he doesn’t publish the
story of our disgrace. So we are hot dis-
graced at all. Bora is herself again—little
sweetheart, come and kith me. (Goes to kiss
husband, but is repulsed.)
Hellmore (weirdly)— Bora, does nothing strike
you ?
Bora One of the girls in the shop hit me with
her umbrella this morning, but that’s all I
c;\n think of. What should strike me?
Hellmore— Hasn’t the miracle landed you right
m the. middle of your soul, or don’t you
possess a soul ? Bora, something strikes me.
It’s Gibsen. I have been living for years with
a strange woman, and am no better than I
ought to be. You have no thoughts in com-
mon with your husband, and you don’t under-
stand me one bit. Even the audience can’t
understand me. Good-bye, Bora. (Moves
towards door.) I’m off with the girl next
door. 1 won t kiss the children. Never did
care much for strange women’s kids, and you
are the strangest woman of my acquaintance.
Bora—-You don't intend to face the bitter world
in those pyjamas, when it’s raining heavens
hard, and the umbrella has gone to be mended.
Y ou’ll get soaked.
Hellmore No matter; a respectable man musn’t
stop under the same roof with a strange lady.
It’s too awful. I must seek a kindred spirit
in the girl next door. The children are born
liars, and if you take my advice you will
drown them .in the pond. Good bye, Bora;
I must be going now. (Exit.)
Bora—Shall I cry “ the miracle? ” I didn’t say
it m Melbourne, not after the first night—
but they stood it in Sydney. Yes, I will
(punches forehead)— The Miracle !!
(Curtain.)
The N.S.W. Ministry deny that any serious
differences exist among them, but the fact remains
that Parkes, chafing under the restraint put upon
his actions by Bruce Smith and M'Millan, who
made his Ministry, and who are not content to be
his creatures, has vowed vengeance in his heart
against the pair.
Pritchard Morgan's new gold-mining
manager in Wales is “Nicky” Williams, an old
Cornish identity of Charters Towers. At one
time Nicky managed the St. Patrick Extended
Block. He is one of those occasional oddities
that mining fields produce—a good, rough, all-
round man, who “done his level best. ” Nicky
shone in the cricket-field as well as in the mine
“ below stairs,” could make a rattling after-dinner
speech, sing a song on call, or stand up and
“maintain his words ” with his “bunch of fives ”
on occasion.
In West Australia no man can go insolvent
unless he owes at least £5O to a creditor, and the
bankruptcy law is so expensive that when he does
go insolvent there is very little left forthe creditor
to receive. For the poor man, it is a harassing
statute; for the big swindler it is a grand cover
for fraud, and lets the fat operator down softly to
the tune of thousands of pounds on a fourpenny
dividend. The small debtor can be worried in the
Local Court for next to nothing, and his first suer
generally sweeps off his goods or lands him in
gaol. West Australia is behind even England in
insolvency barbarisms, running on the old English
Act of 1869.

Spirit is farmed out exclusively to Stead himself.
Amongst the successful applicants for

land.
Some of the English papers are still asking
how it is that no inquest was held on the body of
Sculptor Boehm, who died suddenly in the pre-
sence of the Princess Louise, when they were alone
in his studio. The perhaps needless suppression
of enquiry promises in this case to lead to an
historical scandal.
Alfred Deakin, writing of how “India is
governed wholly from without,” declares that
white and native alike are mere ciphers, or
exercise only such illicit influence as is permitted
to women in England and Australia,” Now, who
among Australia’s married politicians are swayed
by illicit influences ?
One of the jurymen who helped to say

I’ll discharge you,” said Dogberry.
Apropos a recent cablegram :
It is a fact which there is no disputing, that aS Sir
Charles and Lady Dilke rode in the Row the other day,
the Prince of Wales cantered up and joined them.
Astonishment, not to say consternation, was depicted on
the faces of many of our “exclusive” set, who had
vigorously “dropped ” Sir Charles, which was not allayed
when the trio turned their horses together for a third
time.
The London correspondent of a Sydney
daily says that “ Her Majesty is deeply annoyed
at the Prince of Wales being mixed up with the
gambling scandal, and she accorded his Royal
Highness a long interview on the this
week, from which the Prince emerged with evident
signs of mental emotion on his countenance.”
What a well-informed correspondent!
Bishop Moorhouse, formerly of Melbourne,
has thrown another bombshell into the circles of
the orthodox. He has practically admitted that
Christ might err with regard to natural science
and historical criticism, Annie Besant impales
the Bishop with Dr. Pusey’s saying, “ If Jesus—
God forgive it!— said One thing that was not
true, divine authority Would be gone.”
Pall Mall.challenges Lord Mayor Savory,
who has been feebly endeavouring to excuse his
unsavory prigging from Spurgeon, “to produce not
only six ideas but any six sentences even in the
whole of his sermon, which are not cribbed from
Spurgeon’s.” The P.M.G. styles the whole
paltry business “an endeavour to eke out civic
grandeur by a spurious show of pious versatility.”
Gilbey, whose name is associated with
gin-labels iu these parts, has become otherwise
famous “at home ” as the founder of several use-
ful horse-breeding societies. In his legitimate
business Gilbey stands alone, being far and away
the largest importer and manufacturer of cheap
wines in the world. His “shilling ” port is-a joke
that passed into the ranks of “chestnuts” 20
years ago, when the stage funny-man could always
fetch a laugh by saying that he would drink some-
body’s healtli m a glass of “ fine old wine—
Gilbey’s, you know.”

We read that Congressman Simpson, who
refuses to wear socks till the duty on worsted is
repealed, and who persistently returns the socks
sent him by the benevolent, was asked by a pretty
woman at the Capitol: “ Is it true that you don’t
wear socks, Mr. Simpson ? Won’t yon let me see,
please?” “Madam,”replied Mr. Simpson,gravely,
“I’m a believer in reciprocity. Do you wear
socks? If you’ll show me yours I’ll show you
mine ! ”
It is said of the late W. B. Dailey that he
was colour-blind, and that when representing
N.S. Wales on his famous emigration lecturing-
tour, with Mr. Henry Parkes, he was dogged an
London by Scotland Yard detectives. His flaring
neckties (generally bright-red or blue) raised the
suspicion that he was one of the “swell mob”
that flourished in the Big Smoke. Australians
always have complained that the status of their
representatives in England is more than doubtful.

The Australasian’ revives a good story
about old Dean Macartney. A temperance meet-
ing was being held in Melbourne Town Hall. The
Dean did not arrive until alter Bishop Moorhouse
(who presided) had confessed himself to be a
mo .mate drinker. Soon after the Bishop sat
down the Dean entered, and when his turn to
speak came he commenced to denounce in his
thorough-going fashion the “moderate drinkers.”
It was this class of persons, he said, that was
responsible for half the drunkenness with which
the city was cursed. The audience simply yelled.

tion, but,the guillotine.” Just as reasonable.
Look at the result of the monstrous plural
Parliamentary-system as exemplified in the
electoral power possessed by the clubs in East
Sydney; Union Club, 434 votes; N.S.W. Club,
105 ; Athenaeum, 7; Australian, 275; Southern,
03 ; Reform, 5 ; and Warrigal Club, 3 ; in all 922
votes possessed by men nearly all of whom have
and exercise votes in other constituencies !
Parkes is going to the country on the
issue “Federation and Freetrade.” Now',
Federation admittedly and inevitably means Pro
tection against the world, and that very quickly.
Ergo, Parkes is going to the country on Freetrade
and Protection. Q.E.D. In this case Freetrade
and Federation are so far unlike the Siamese
twins that life to one means death to the other.
The mission of The People, a new weekly
Democratic sheet, published at Perth, W.A.. is
to effect reform in the present one-sided Conserva-
tive Constitution of that province. The abolition
of the property qualification for members, man-
hood suffrage, and promotion by merit in the
Civil Service will be prominent planks in its
platform. The “ Six Families ” and their friends
have decided not to support the new journal.
The Bulletin stated a few weeks ago that
Sir Henry Parkes was the proposer of “ Common-
wealth ” as a name for the Australian Federation.
That was true. A Melbourne paper now says
that Deakin is in high feather, because he is the
real godfather of the “Commonwealth.” That is
also true. The artful Deakin, knowing Parkes’
weakness, got the term suggested to Parkes, and
(then enthusiastically seconded the Old Man’s
proposal.
A Mr. Begg, of the Imperial Federation
League, remarks that ex-Governor Carington’s
contention that the colonies should be kept free
from restraint by the mother country was not
sound. “It was not reasonable, for instance,
thfit Australia should have unlimited right to
decide from her own standpoint upon questions
which .might involve this country in war.” Just
so; but tfiis argument cuts even more sharply the
other way,
Melbourne Age, by way of explaining that
all public rioting is sinful, recalls to mind the
case of Sir Charles Napier and the Chartists —
“The sympathies of Sir Charles were with the
men in their demands, wholly against them when
.they resorted to violence.” In short, he was
above all things a soldier, having heaps of sym-
pathy for the oppressed until they attempted to
shake off oppression, and then considering tha,t
his duty to the Queep required him to blow away
“ public disaffection ” with a .whiff of grape.
Wholesale Suicide.
The present generation of mankind seems
.determined to proceed along the path that leads
to death —the one that will kill it quickest. The
struggle for existence, business worry, gambling,
horse-racing and all nervous excitements,' tend to
reduce the vital strength and insure early death.
Now-a-days it is the pace that kills ; the body is
.worn out before its natural spell of life is spent.
There is no reason why.all men and women—
physically perfect—should not live" to be centen-
arians, provided care was taken that the system
was not overtaxed in any particular direction.
The symptoms of failing vitality are almost too
well known to need enumeration here; first the
appetite fails, with pain after eating, nervousness
ensiifc, and -f.eepless or restless nights with head-
aches and tired aching limbs on arising in the
morning; a confirmed languor Or lassitude takes
possession of the sufferer, who loses all interest in
pleasure and even in life itself. Unfortunately
such cases are only too common, such experiences
come to every man, and on the first approach of
such sure signs of strength’s faijute, recourse must
be had to a remedy to restore the failing vitality
or quickly he sinks into the everlasting “ for ever-
more.” Such cases, if treated in time, quickly
yield to Clements Tonic. Long standing cases
require protracted treatment, but in all curable
cases Clements Tonic will quickly re-invigorate
the system, restore the vim and spirit of youth,
build up new bone, muscle and nerve tissue, create
an appetite and properly digest and assimilate
food. This is no boast, Clements Tonic is genuine,
that it will do the good its manufacturers claim
for it lias been proved in thousands of cases, as in
.that of W. H. Oram, Esq., Crookwell, N.S.W.,
who writes:—“For nine months I have used
Clements Tonic and have great pleasure in giving
my testimony as to its great efficacy and wonder-
ful curative effects on the nervous system. I have
frequently left the office with severe headache
and despondency, due to excessive mental labour,
have been unable to take any food and had no
appetite, and in every case a dose of Clements
Tonic has quickly removed the melancholy, created
an appetite and caused me to relish a meal. I
have so much faith in Clements Tonic that I can
conscientiously recommend it to professional men
and brain workers generally. I have seen it used
for children with best results, and as for myself I
would not be without it in the house.” And Mr,
Robert A. Luckham, travelling representative of
The Sydney Bulletin, a gentleman known in
almost every city, town and village in Australasia,
testifies to the value of Clements Tonic, thus :
“ Bulletin Office, Sydney,—lt affords me much
pleasure to be able to testify to the many admirable
qualities of Olements Tonic ; having used it for
a short time 1 found my strength wonderfully
restored. I had been suffering from extreme
nervous debility, from which I have now quite
recovered. I consider Clements Tonic a great
tone-giving and delightfully refreshing stimulant.”

I was once pestered by a gentleman to recommend him for the Council. He saw me
again and again, and finally on one occasion said that if a cheque for £lO,OOO were lying on

Another feature of the (Electoral) bill
be to give women as human beings the rights
to vote. . . . Their liberty is subject to
the laws of the country, and if they commit
a certain class of crimes their lives are sub-

so, why in the name, of reason should not
they have the power of assisting in' the

When the Sydney Social Gimlet Brigade
failed upon Parkes with the mild request that
he would hand all the giddy pictures in the
cigar shop windows Over to Nosey Bob, the liailg-
man, to be burnt, a good brother (possibly know-
ing Sir ’Enry’s aversion) drew his attention to ohe
particularly offensive specimen. “Ydu’ll hob-
serve,’ he said, “the extreme hindelicacy Of the
production, Sir ’Enry, when I hexplain that at
first sight it’s perfectly chaste, and that in order
to see the thing in all its vileness you’ve got to
turn it hup.side down, and then (holding it at
arm’s length) to look at it steadily with one heye
shut.” It’s surprising what aptitude some zealous
Christians have for turning divine.sunbeams round
pasty corners. Bishop Barry who was one of the
deputation; asked the reporters to omit all mention
of the good man’s ingenuity, and the obedient
papers did. You should just hear Parkes tell this
story.

A (two-ounce) glove exhibition (not prize-
fight that would be low) for money came off a
little while back at a fashionable Melbourne
athletic hall. At the end of the sixth round one
of the lads was in a fearful state —his nose was
smashed clean across his face, part of one ear was
hanging and part of it was off (’twas afterwards
stitched on), both eyes were black, and the boy’s
body was a mass of br .ises. He was, indeed, a
sorry spectacle. But the gentlemen of the club
(among them some of the leading doctors, law-
yers, &c.) howled for another round, and at the
end thereof there was a general stampede for hats
and overcoats as a very limp figure was carried
out, placed in a cab, and driven to Dr. Fizgig’s
hospital. For some days afterwards not a°soul
had seen the fight - oh, no. A cheque for £3O was
handed over to the battered one, who ultimately
Went for a trip, and the gentlemen breathed

John Kruse, the young Australian-born
violinist, is, we read, shortly to be married to an
Austrian Countess. If John is yoking himself to
the nobility let him beware of re-entering a vulgar
country where the mention of the name of Kruse
recalls, not only melody, but also bug-powder.
Insecfcide is unstable regarded as a foundation
for romance. Apropos, we remember an Italian
Countess who ca-me out to Australia to marry a
pompous gumsucker with castor-oil on his
curls, who had met her while travelling in Italy
and had told her that his family lived in a splendid
Australian palace of which he showed her a
photograph. On arrival she found that he did
live in a palace. It was the State Treasury, and
the young man’s father, as messenger, had
quarters therein. Then the Italian Countess
went back to her maccaroni, priests and bad
street smells.

As they have altered the name of the
Yarrangohilly (N.S.W.) Caves to the “Jersey”

has anyone to christen he will return the com pin

Villiers.” This, in the immortal words of Alfred
Bennett, “would take well and give pleasure to
all.”

. party of Melbourne nobilities recently
visited the Gipsland Lakes’ entrance. Amongst
them were a Cabinet Minister (married) and a
well-known sculptor and his wife, a very beautiful
dame. The sculptor missed the train at one of
the stations, having outstayed his allotted interval
for alighting. A young joker, who was also of the
party, at the next stopp ng-pli.ce, sent a wire back
to the sculptor-“ Your wife disapumred with
Minister X. ; am on the track.” The recipient
ki ew it to be a joke and only smiled. But the
1 oorak gossipersgot hold of it, mixed it up, spread
it around, added to it, until it became a confirmed
creed in Toorakia that Minister X was a bold, bad
man and Mrs. Sculptoress (who had reappeared)

15s. in the £, with 10 p.c. added. Bills matured
and were dishonored; once more into the mill,
dear friends. Third insolvency for 75 p.c. of
“total plus 10 p.c.,” with 10 p.c. added on the
75 ; offered his creditors 10s. in the £, with 10 p.c.
added. Why detail ? Bung again, of course, and
got off with ss. in the new total of debts, bn
unsecured bills at 12 months. Not a bill was paid.
Off-colour once more, and offered Is. in the £
with usual interest; small insolvency this time if
you calculate it, and as he was a small man they
made him find security. This time every bill was
“honorably paid,” and the honest man stands
accredited before the world as a reputable trader.
Work it out and you will find that for every £lOO

from the encampment in a bum-boat and blared
defiance with bassoons at their cruel oppressors
to the great amusement of a big crowd.

Hawk Moore is not surprised to hear that
Mr. Edward Bulwer Dickens is not a success in
the Sydney Legislature, to which he was returned
last year, and hears that a recent speech of his
was received with derisive cries. “The N.S.W.
Assembly is a very peculiar body, holding refine -
nient in contempt, and admitting only one claim
to respect—descent from the original colonists .
Botany Bay,” says Moore. Not so. Mr. E. B. L.
Dickens was elected chiefly because lie was the
son of his father—because there still lingers in the
N.S. W. electors some faint traces of respect for
the absurd system of hereditary honors, to main-
tain wtiich in England appears the chief end and
aim of Mr. Disgustus Moore and his assistant
boot-lickers.

A partner in one of the largest wholesale
houses in Australianowholds that silence is golden.
Some time ago he paid dearly for learning how to
stick his tongue in his cheek. It was like this.
The commercial-room likes to spice its drinks
with scandal, and not to be behind-hand, our
little friend of “ the roads ” trotted out a skeleton
from the local surgeon’s cupboard. Unluckily
for him, the medico himself was amongst the
audience, and when the story was ended not only
complimented the bagman on the veracity of his
yarn, but proceeded to add an element of humour
—hoisting him on to the dinner-table, partially
disrobing him after the fashion adopted by stern
fathers, and, much to the amusement of the com-
pany, administering a sound caning. The bagmen
of S. A. know this yarn.

saw grand hotel life for the first time, and
luncheoned tahle-d'hote. On the bill-of-fare
was “ Welsh rabbit.” When the august waiter
came for his order, Viv. said meekly—“l’m very
fond of Welsh rabbit; I’ll have some. ” “Yessir
’ow many ? ” “ How many ? Oh, half a little one
will do.” “Yessir,” said the waiter, and never
turned a hair, but brought it. Yiv, was too de-
pressed to make any remark about the small
square of yellow leather on toast, and that’s all he
took for dinner that day. If any shearer yells
out at Tozer, “How do you like Welsh rabbit?”
lie’ll be run in for certain.

The first two weddings at the new St.
Paul’s Cathedral, Melbourne, took place last week.
The first one was of “gentry, but poor”—that is
to say, not wallowing in lucre, such as the Church
delights to honor. So the service was “slum-
mocked,” mumbo-jumboed over anyhow. But
now came the Golden Calves, the Holy Yeal—
oho ! and the sacred fane was desecrated by
restricting admission to holders of gilt-edged
cards, and Toorakia came prancing along. Extra
parsons rolled up~Rev. Stretch appeared in his
stole as wonderful as Joseph’s coat of many
colours. Rev. So and So assisted, also Rev. So
and- So. The service was most impressively
chanted, the organ was unlocked, and forth oame
the delicious Wedding March and Voice that
breathed o’er Eden, for Adam and Eve in golden
fig leaves, with ivory-backed prayer-books. And
lo ! a sweet savour ascended, and the Most High
called for an ounce of civet, good apothecary !
Apropos, Rev, Hugh Price-Hughes says: “Mil-
lionaires must go.” “By jingo !” sarcastically
remarks Carnegie, “if the millionaire goes, he
takes tile parson with him. They will go forth
together hand in hand, l>ke Adam and Eve out
of Paradise, seeking light employment, with
heavy pay.”

Sir John Robertson denies that when he
was a bo/ he formed a romantic acquaintance
with Lord Palmerston. Tins is a pity, because
the story’s good enough for Miss Braddon. Mak-
ing up his mind One day to see the world—so says
the —he shipped as supercargo on board a
vessel returning to Londbn, and, shortly before
Sailing, fell in with a poor devil on the wharf, Who
OHe red him a letter to Lord Palmerston. Jack
thought it a practical joke. At all eVents, the
letter was carried in due time to the official
address, and, heeding the warning that he was to
deliver it personally, the young adventurer ran
the gauntlet of messengers up to the door of the
great Foreign Secretary’s room. The Irig man
stroked his hair (not so white in those days) and
invited him to Broadlands for a little sport. The
finest bird they winged was a beautiful woman.
1 hey found her soon after breakfast sitting in a
very snug nest within the grounds of the ances-
tral mansion. “This is the young gentleman
Who brought me the letter from Australia,” said
Pam. The lady r —a dignified, middle-aged party rtf
the Virgin Queen type—WAs interested in 'the
youthful visitor. The youthful visitor, it is said.

A “tragedy” report in Melbourne Aue
mentions that “Mr. Joseph Coyne, a labourer, at

named Joseph Coyne.” The point is worth
noticing.

Some of the little darlings who danced in
an amateur ballet at the People’s Palace, Mel-
bourne, in a church-aid show, threw up their legs
to such a giddy height that even their mammas
were shocked. Two or three parsons, however,
watched this novel entertainment without shud-
dering. At other times, too, these broad-
principled shepherds might have been seen
gloating over the antics of a professional coryphee
—a Mdlle. Somebody—whose skirts were con-
siderably shorter than the average sermon. The
Church evidently regards legs as “innocent,
rational amusements,” so long as they are assist-
ing to build a new Sunday-school, or reducing the
organ debt. And the better the leg, the better
the deed.

Brisbane, closes one of the most hospitable and
popular houses in that city. The old man is said
to have arrived in Bananaland, from England, at
the age of two years, and to have been 60 when he
died, but years are apt to get mixed up in young
countries, and the writer, at any rate, would fancy
George Harris much older than 60, and with a
previous knowledge of other parts of Australia.
However, J. and G. Harris were established as
merchants in Brisbane in its early days, and were
followed up by George Harris and Co., the
“ style ” of the deceased subject of these remarks.
He had social and financial fancies of a very broad
kind, though never accused of possessing too much
money. One of his daughters married R. G.
Casey, of Normanby Station, and the other G. C.
Taylor, of Bellevue, Esk district. The latter was
the son of Millionaire Taylor, “ king of
Toowoomba,” and ectype of N.S. Wales’ own
Jack Robertson as a picturesque orator and
“ bonvive. ” The old man himself married a Miss
Thorn, said (like the late Mrs. Donald Wallace)
to have been born under the tilt of a bullock-
dray, and one of the most beautiful girls ever
born anywhere. She developed into a kind,
matronly hostess, and Newstead was the social
refuge of every wandering and homeless English-
FATTENING FATTA.
Sing a song of Fatta GHarid,
Wretched heathen sinner j,
Got to hang, you understand;
But ignored his dinner.
Not the former, but the latter
Trouble seemed to be the matter,
For, instead of growing fatter,
T atta dwindled thinner.
Sing a song of Eatta Chand—
Gruesome little ballad--
Beef he wouldn’t look at, and
Chucked away his salad.
Fanciful as any wench is
Who objects to Melbourne stenches,
He was getting what, in French, is
Recognised as mal- ade.
Sing a song of Fatta Chand.
Doctor kept on banging
Of his forehead with his hand,
While he stood haranguing
All day long that naughty nigger,
Who was losing of his figger
Which they wanted plumper, bigger,
Heavier for hanging.
Sing a song of Fatta Chand,
Sullen and dejected.
Fresh arrangements have been planned
Food is now injected.
Nothing’s put upon his platter,
Yet they load him up with batter.
Fitter now is brother Fatta
■ Than the Crown expected.
■Sing a song of Fatta Chand,
Though with Fate he wrangles,
Soon he’ll join a Hindoo band
Up am ng the “angles,”
Blessings on the good physician
Who fulfils his legal mission
To get Fatta in condition,
Ere Ins body dangles.

quarter of a century, and was a member of the
Upper House in Queensland’s first Parliament.
One of his sons, J. E. Harris, has somehow got

The Melbourne-trained young-lady doctors

There was to be seen in a Swanston street
(Melbourne) pawnshop window not so very long
a Melbourne Cup, with name erased, but
* supposed to be old Toryboy’s. In another window
.was exhibited the Adelaide Gold Gup, with
Mata’s name on it; also, a gold dog-collar with a
Well-known NiZ. gentleman’s name attached —all

It is quite a mistake to imagine that the
threatened revival at “home” of knee-breeches
•will be opposed by tbin-legged men. No mail’s
leg is thin in his own estimation, and the Sim
Tappertit of “Barnaby Rndge” Was merely
human in believing that his distorted broomsticks
were “ twin invaders of domestic peace.” For a
proof that British character hasn’t changed since
the times when the whole male population de-
lighted to wear knee-breeches, one has only to run
hfs eye along a bicycle-club. Dogs bark at many
~f the members under the impression that they
ttre bones.

The Bulletin warns whom it may concern
of a new style of swindle. It happened in Bris-

tried in Sydney now* Advertisements are pub-
lished calling for tenders. Applicants turn up in
numbers at the ostensible architect’s office, inspect
plans, &cv* put in tenders, and call again. Each
is asked to make a deposit as security, and a day
is named for acceptance of one tender and the
return of the remaining deposits. That day is
really the Judgment Day. When the specified
date arrives, the office is closed and the architect
is found to be “a stranger, who took the office a
few days before and has left.” Moral -. Deal only
with known local men, and give guarantees but
not cash deposits.

At Walcha (N.S.W.) Show the high jump

between Mr. Jas. Moor's Pine Tree (Miss N.

raised to oft. Gin.', which both horses cleared in
splendid style. The committee then stepped in
and stopped the proceedings, although the riders
wished to go on to a finish. Miss Fletcher, we
read, is a native of Walcha, and Mrs. Stace of the

Edmund Yates observes that the alleged

It is a melancholy satire on London
journalism that the World should advise Truth
to procure another editor, “one more conversant
with the ways of clubs and society.” What lofty
qualifications for an editor ! Truth’s reply to
this will probably take the form of a sneer at the
World for having issued a “ridiculously in-
accurate” account of what the Queen did after
dinner last Thursday three weeks, or a crushing
denial of the report published in our contemporary
respecting the Duke of Connaught’s arrangements
for the third Saturday in December.

The only actually offensive things in the
Melbourne Art Gallery are the colossal sitting
statues of Victoria, Albert, Wales* and Alexandra,
by Summers, sloppy, hastily-sculped produc-
tions, entirely unworthy of that artist genius.
But with what disgust he did them, to the order
of Bart. Clarke, who vainly hoped for a peerage !
Summers, while in Melbourne many years ago,
did a figure of Albion, over a drapery-shop, in
Richmond, and also sculped the cherubs and gar-
lands along the frieze of the Bank of New South
W ales.

Ada Christina Reid, of Tintinhull, N.S. \V.,
has had her broken heart half-soled at Tamworth
Circuit Court, at which she impeached her
faithless lover, Walter Scott Laidlaw, a mounted-
constable, for breach of promise. It was a
rather prosaic affair. The parties had known
eacli other from childhood, and Walter had been
faithful until change of scene altered him. He
was foolish enough to write Ada an offer
of marriage, and also to write asking
her to forget him, as he had been de-
partmentally “ reported,” and his official
career was blasted and he didn’t want her to share
his misery. Ada asked the Court to award her
£5OO, as she had refused an interim offer from “ a
gentleman of good repute,” and had fallen through
grief “into a bad state of health.” “The plain-
tiff,” meltmgly exclaimed Judge Windeyer, “is
thrown upon the marriage-market as a damaged
article.” Verdict for £lOO.

Queer how things turn out ! The wife of
one of the Australian labour leaders, when some-
thing under two years old, nearly died for want of
food and water through the brutality of a Queens-
land squatter who, in a time of drought, wilfully
directed her father thirty miles out of his road to
prevent him driving through his run. The young
lady is said to have demolished a bottleful of
pickles en route. Her husband is now distributing
the Vinegar.
Everything lias its uses. Bustles having
gone out dog-muzzles seem to be coining in, even
in hydrophobia-less Australia.

A lately-iiiarried woman asked to describe
how she felt while the ceremony was proceeding,
announced to a roomful of happily-married
women : “ I looked around the church at all the
men’s faces and I Wondered how any of you women
could ever have married anybody but John.” Love
is blind ; some Say also silly.
Judge Windeyer
says that “ some most
respectable parents have
most disreputable sons.”
True, your Honor. But,
as a set-off, in New
South Wales, many
“most respectable”
people have had most
disreputable parents.

In a Sydney daily,

significantly “that she

Blank knows his spouse
better than we do, and that he will look upon the
intimation as to cash as another dodge of the Old
’ooman’s to bring him once more .within roach of

general manner of life of officers in other words,
of sneakery and spying and the employment of

The other day the clerks in a Sydney

THE DIPSOMANIAC.
What is it?
THE INFLUENCE THAT SOMETIMES GUIDES US
AGAINST OUR WILL.
“No, I do not believe in ghosts,” said an old
lady of great experience, “ but I do believe in the
ministration of spirits.” This is not the age nor
the country in which the supernatural flourishes!
Interest centres about the practical. Haunted
houses are rented without great difficulty, if the
landlord is willing to knock off a portion of the
rent. There are many, however, who will admit
the exertion at times of some peculiar influences
swaying our actions. We are led to do things we
should not do of our own volition—the wisdom of
•which we do not appreciate until afterwards;
then we wonder how we came to do them. We
are forced to learn that worldly wisdom is not
always that which guides into the wisest courses.
In tliis practical age remits are what people are
looking after. They believe in what they see;
the'“ evidence of things not seen ” is to be
weighed in the future. When a man is sick he
wants to get well, he caves little what medical
method is employed if it cures. But if it does not
cure he soon begins to doubt the skill of the
physician, and enquire into his methods of medi-
cation. A happy thing it is sometimes if some
influence induces investigation before it is too
late. Mr. E. W. Edmondson, of Melbourne,
writes, 21st October, 1890: —“ During the past 10
years I have been ailing periodically from a
serious affection of the kidneys, and in latter
years my complaint became more acute, so that I
was frequently seized with stabbing pains in the
back. 1 had often prolonged headaches, the
result of liver disorder. For years I thus suffered,
and I thought this disorder of the kidneys and
iiver would bring about a more serious disease.
Finally I tried the affects of Warner’s safe cure,
and not until then did I experience any ameliora-
tion in my condition. The use of this medicine
speedily wrought a great change and four bottles
effected a complete cure.” Note what Mr. Henry
Warwick, of Lonsdale Street, Melbourne, says:—
“ 30th October, 1890 —For some years I have been
suffering from frequent attacks of gravel, often
with unbearable pains in the back and right side,
and my digestive organs were also out of order.
In addition 1 was afflicted with congest on of the
liver and periodical headaches of a severe nature.
My suffering was quickly removed when re-
sorting to Warner’s safe cure, of which I took four
bottles, when the acute pains in the right side,
caused by the congestion of the liver, ceased,
while my kidneys were restored to healthy action.”

846 Maoquarie-slreet North, Sydney, April 22, 1891.
My Dear Moorabinda.—
If I were going to marry some wealthy old man do you
think I’d be so foolish as some girls are over the allow-
ance question ? They are so terrified that he might think
they marry him for money, that when he says (as happened
lately), “ We’ll arrange your allowance when we’re mar-
ried, ray dear,” the poor things acquiesce ecstatically, and,
if they are very artful, throw in, perhaps, some fathom-
less assertion that “all gold is dross beside a loving
heart,” &c., &c. In Victoria recently a young woman
became an old man’s darling simply for the accruing cash,
but when the orange-blossoms had been swept into the
corner and the lady was cold “Mrs. 5.,” she found that
30s. a week was her pin-money, and that all bills had to
be submitted to the master for payment ! Very few rich
matrons have as much money as people think they have,
and it is a well-known fact that one “rich” Australian
woman actually can’t get a threepenny-bit without asking
for it, and never carries a purse ! This is one way in
which Robin Gray actually gets square on the deal and
Jeannie is paid out for her double-shuffle.
I wonder why caterers for big ball-suppers don’t label
the principal sweets, just as they do the sandwiches and
sherry? At public balls especially this is a long-felt
want, for the ignorant of both sexes usually indicate
their fancy by asking for some of that “shaky pink
thing”(or as the case may be), while Jeames curls his
long upper-lip in professional contempt. Then it would
save the unaccustomed young man from being airily dis-
patched for Charlotte Russe and coming back with tipsy-
cake, and having to blacken his soul by declaring that
Charlotte was off, with his conscience telling him all the
time that he didn’t know even what she was made of
Labelling all the big dishes would lift a great weight
from the minds of the young men who fetch and carry
for hungry partners.
Mr. and Mrs. Burdekin have now become a myth to
Sydneyites (some people say that they were that all along
to some of the citizens), and the Manning regime is in-
augurated in the usual manner, amid the widespread
hope that the new order of things civic will essentially
differ from that of the Burdekin era, when Society was
first and the “City” nowhere. The ex-Mayor and
Mayoress plainly showed their hand over their first and
only ball, when people who, with clock-like regularity,
had attended the Mayor’s ball from year to year were
scratched off the invitation-list and the cards issued on
a strictly “ select ” basis. The Burdekins certainly enter-
tained a great deal, but not the kind of people who
expected to be entertained, and in consequence they w T ere
(in a purely civic sense) about as unpopular a couple as
Sydney has ever seen. Pretty Mrs. Burdekin was cer-
tainly the most charming Mayoress we have ever had—
only the bulk of her “ subjects ” never got an opportunity
to find it out.
They say that the reason why an emotional married
actress was not invited to join the Austral Salon was that
somebody saw her gallivanting about Melbourne Botanical
Gardens at an early hour “ with one of the company,”
who had his arm round her waist, while her lovely head
rested on his shoulder and she fanned him gently with a
palm-leaf screen. It was a graceful tableau, and it only
the other party had been her husband-but hold! Per-
haps in Melbourne, as in Sydney, the authorities object
to a man hugging his own wife in the Gardens. We all
know what happened when Curator Moore, of Sydney
Botanical Gardens, caught a man nursing his (the man’s)
wife.
Melbourne’s brand-new Cathedral, St. Paul’s, solem-
nized-its first wedding the other day, Dr. William
Chisholm, the accomplished young surgeon, of Macquarie*
street north, Sydney, and Miss “Pinkie” Mitchell, third
daughter of Mr. T. Mitchell, of Bringenbrong, Upper
Murray, N.S.W. (formerly of Victoria), being the
culprits. The ceremony was very quiet, although the
floriture for a “grand” wedding which came later gave
quite an elaborate air to the bell, book and candl e
business ; and after the knot had been irrevocably tied a
huge family Bible was given to the happy pair as a
souvenir of being the first couple united on the premises.
The second wedding (meant to be the first) on the same
day at the same cathedral, was that of Miss Thirza
Aitken, daughter of Mr. Thomas Aitken, of “ The Elms,”
East Melbourne, to Doctor Herman Lawrence, of Victoria.
•Che service (fully choral under the gifted direction of
Organist Wood) cost £5O, and the whole affair was
gorgeous, there being eight bridesmaids and two pages in
white satin and lace, while the pretty bride wore % hand-
some gown of white Duchesse, brocade and chiffon and
carried a nosegay of white exotics and ferns. The wed-
ding-ring was a slight departure from the conventional
plain gold band, having “LOVE” engraved on it. On
her marriage-day the bride came into a fortune of forty
thousand pounds. It is rather a coincidence that of the
two initial marriages at St. Paul’s both brides were third
■daughters, and both bridegrooms medical men.
The weary old cry is going up in the newspapers over
the lady-help question—the beggarly pittance for work
that reaches from the parlour to the dust-box. An advt.
appears in a Sydney daily for a lady-help to do everything
under the sun—from playing the piano to scrubbing
floors—for £25 per, annum—los. a week! How the
niggardly housewife must bless that shadowy fetish,
‘Appearances!” which induces a young woman, who
might bo a skilled domestic at a good wage, to dress
jmatly, be ladylike, do the housework all day and enter,
tain guests after she has washed up at night, on a pittance
that Bridget would sneer at! And what is the advan-
tage? I have seen “Miss Jones” on the field of her
duties—have seen the vulgar look of contempt the “lady’>
visitor throws at her worn finger-nails and knocked-about
hands as she essays to accompany her song-have seen
how she Sits, almost unnoticed, unless she happens to be
pretty, and then the young men think it their privilege
to treat her as I have seen them treat waitresses. And
these, remember, are the “ advantages” of her situation.
Now that Lady Jersey has arisen and responded “ ably
and fluently” to the toast of “The Ladies,” at Maitland
Show banquet, we will no doubt have a rest from the sight
of the fat, hazy M.P., steadying himself on the table and
stating the old mournful poser: “Shentle- (hie)- men,
where, I say, where would we have bin if it hadn’t been
for the ladies?” In his stead some bewchus and bilious-
looking being with the gift of the gab will arise with the
grace of an angel in course of resurrection and, calm in
the knowledge of vice-regal precedent, will cackle lovely
woman’s acknowledgements—probably until thechairman
orders her to sit down. But, for myself, I would much
rather have a man stand up for the ladies, because (to
advance a painfully frivolous reason) women live only to
be flattered, and it is so nice to hear high-flown compli-
ments even though you know that they are insincere. A
woman in “reply” couldn’t very well be flattering, since
it is the worst of taste to draw attention to your own
virtues.
From Mr. George Castledon, of Newcastle (N.S.W.), I
have received a very danceablenaltz called the “Mignon”
with a good swing in it from first to last, without which a
waltz might just as well be an Irish jig. It is easy to
play and could be learnt by memory (as all dance-music
must be) almost in one sitting. Altogether the “Mignon”
valse ought to have quite a run at drawing-room dances,
carpet “at homes,” and other haunts of the amateur
musician.
After all, there is nothing like calling a spade a spade.
Says a recent Sydney advt. :
A THOROUGHLY EXPERIENCED Housekeeper
_ seeks ENGAGEMENT to widower, children not
objected to. Address Experience, Post-office, Wool-
lahra.
A registry-office woman once told me that one of the list
of her household guardian angels confessed, in a burst of
confidence, that she always carried a white silk “that
would do for a wedding-dress ” in her trunk whenever she
undertook the responsibility of looking after the creature
comforts of a bachelor or a widower.
Some physiologist, apparently a woman, has discovered
that a woman should weigh two pounds to every longi.
tudinal inch, and that the average woman—sft. fin. with-
out shoes—should weigh 128 to 130 pounds ; her waist
should be 25in., her chest from back to front 6in., and
her bust 30 to 31 inches. These are ideal measurements,
of course—what women ought to be, not what they are ;
for, upon the propounder of these weights and measures
examining 325 average young women, it was found that the
distance round the body, from front to back, was painfully
defective in most; it was also found that the average
waist was 22, and bust 29. The theory of the properly-
proportioned woman weighing two pounds to the inch is a
regular throw-in for the sylph of sft. 10in., who is perfectly
justified in turning the scale at lOst.
A Melbourne lady dress-reporter had a dreadful experi-
ence, the other day, at a big Jewish wedding. She
wanted to browse round among the gifts and tick off the
names of the people who had given tea-pots and things,
but when she sought to enter this plated Paradise her
way was barred by a member of the family: “You can’t
see the presents now, there is no one to show them to
you.” “Oh, I don’t want anybody—l suppose the cards
are attached?” And then came the answer ; “Oh, cer-
tainly, but do you think we’re going to trust you with the
presents alone ?” To her credit, be it said, the Lady
Jenkins turned round immediately and left the house.
At a big, swell ball given in Sydney, the other evening,
one of the debutantes was heavily powdered from her
shoulders to her forehead. What a lovely work of art
she will be when she has been going for one or two
seasons !
In the S. M. Herald, the other day, a waif crying out
for bread and lodgings ended his advt.—“ Grown-up
daughters objected to.” Poor young man ! I suppose
the iron must have entered his soul in the usual way.
First, the beauteous Being who looked really dashing
when the curling-papers were off and who played his
accompaniments at an angle of ten degrees towards him
and who was so fond of sitting in the gloaming “Aren’t
you, Mr. Smythe?” second, came the breach of promise
case when the lady fainted in the witness-box and her
mother shook her umbrella at him. Or perhaps he has
suffered at the hands of the domesticated daughter who
would make him all his favourite dishes and send him his
breakfast in bed—until the other boarder came.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.

The historical N.S.VV. School of Industry annual ball
will take place at Needs’ rooms towards the end of May.
It will be held in the presence of Lord and Lady Jersey,
and promises to be, as usual, a brilliant success. 1
The annual intercolonial lawn-tennis tournament (Vic-
toria versus N.S.W.) is to happen on Sydney Association
Ground from 9th to 16th of May, under thepatronage of
Lord and Lady Jersey, who are to be present on the open-
ing day (Saturday). Mr. P. T. Robinson, Royle’s Chambers
Bond-street, Sydney, is hon. sec.
This German custom of the second-ballot
is good, requiring the winner to have an absolute
majority. In Australia it would have got us
Labour members long ago. At the same time it
would have nipped out Hancock, in Gollingwood
last week.
Special Reporter Lambie of Melbourne
Age, (who went to the Soudan for the S. M.
Herald) was mistaken for a squatter’s spy at
Barcaldine shearers’ camp the other day, but
managed cleverly to explain his identity and mis-
sion ere a few excited men carried out a notion of
washing him under the bore-tap.
The venerable Sir George Grey,—he was
80 on 14th instant—had not been in Adelaide two
hours ere he, after the public reception was over,
went to visit the cemetery containing the grave of
his only child, who died over 45 years ago. The
mother, who has long since passed away, was,
when Grey married her, a beautiful girl of 16
years—the daughter of a Government official at
Albany, W.A.
The London police are making raids on
betting “clubs” agam. They do these things
every fifteen years, or so, and when half a dozen
little “hells’’have been shut up the authorities
find themselves afraid to go any further, for fear
they might stumble across a prince. The places
raided last week would not be clubs, but “hells,”
where bookmakers were caught paying and
receiving money. A high-toned establishment
that books its bets is all right because the law
can’t arrest gamblers “on the nod.” Justice is
too fond of nodding itself.

A certain plunger just now out of business,
has always been ready to back his opinion.
When his father died and left the “ plunger ”
and a brother with some embarassed station-
property, the equity of redemption was sold for
£5OO each. The plunger said £5OO was no good to
him. So he went to Flemington and backed
horses. His luck was good, and he invested his
winnings in silver shares, which turned out
magnificently. Another instance of “ lightly come,
lightly go.”
SUICIDE OR NO SUICIDE.
The New York Life Insurance Company
Pays Its Policy.
It being evident that most cases of self-destruc-
tion involve causes not under the victim’s own
control, and that accident and murder may easily
give rise to a suspicion of voluntary death, the
New York Life Insurance Company, in order to
prevent wrongs to the unfertunate, makes its
policies absolute security. It exercises caution in
granting a policy, and never issues one unless its
officers consider the applicant a good risk. But
when it has once issued its policy and taken the
premium, it feels bound to insure. It does not
insert in its policies the usual clause making them
void in case of “self-destruction, voluntarily or
involuntarily, sane or insane,” and claims no re-
lease from its contract except where there is
evidence of a purpose to defraud. In short, so
far as a life policy may properly be such, the New
York Life’s policies are incontestable from the
moment the first premium is paid. The man with a
New York Life Insurance policy may feel sure that,
incase of his death, no delay, litigation or loss will
arise from the question of self-destruction—
whether it be accidental or otherwise. If he has
been honestly insured, and honestly conforms to
the simple requirements of the contract, the pay-
ment of his policy is sure on proof of his death.

UINIMPEACHABLE TESTIMONY
Pacts are established by testimony. This is so,
not only in laws of business and right, but also in
social life. But while the importance of evidence
is thus everywl.ere acknowledged, its weight is
purely dependent upon the character of the wit-
nesses. Unimpeachable test.many is therefore what
is wanted. Upon this principle the following
names are presented to the public as being those
of parties wi.o, having exi erienced or observed
the effects of the great German remedy, St. Jacobs
oil, accord it their hearty endorsement :
The Right Rev. Bishop Gilmour, Cleveland,
Ohio: “Excellent for rheumatism and
kindred diseases. It has benefited me
greatly.”
Hon. Ed. Salomon, Ex-Gov. Washington Ter.
San Prancisco, Cal. : “My cure of severe
rheumatism and lameness by St. Jacobs oil
was instantaneous. ’
Prof, 'lice, the renowned meteorologist, St.
Louis, Mo.: “Almost instant relief from
excruciating pain.”
Mine. Marie Salvotti, Prima Donna Wilhelmj
Concert Troupe; “Nothing can compare
with it as a prompt and reliable cure for
ailments named.”
Win. H. Waremg, Esq., Asst. Genl. Supt.
Th rd Division Marling and Distributing
Dept. New York Post Office : “ Proved
equal to all that is claimed for the oil, and
found efficacious, Ready relief for rheu-
matic complaints.”
Hon. Thomas L. James, Postmaster, New
York : “ Referring to Supt. Warning’s
report, concerning St. Jacobs oil, ‘I con-
cur.’”
Professor C. O. Duplessis, Manager Chicago,
111., Gymnasium; “Our professionals and
amateurs use it in preference to everything
we know of or have ever tried.”
Geo. W. Whalling, Esq., Supt. Police, New
York City; “Members of this Dept, re-
lieved of iheumatism by its use.”
Hon. Leonard Swett, the Great Lawyer of the
North-west, Chicago, 111. : “ Certainly the
best remedy of the kind I have ever known.”
Capt. Paul Boyton, the World-renowned Swim-
mer : “I do not see how I could get along
without St. .Jacobs oil.”
M. V. B. Hersom, Esq. (Pinkham and Hersom),
Boston, Mass.: “After spending vainly
five hundred dollars for other remedies, I
have no hesitation in declaring that St.
Jacobs 0.l will cure neuralgia.”
Stacey Hill, Esq., Mt. Auburn Inclined Plane
Railway, Cincinnati, < hio : “Undoubtedly
it is a remarkable medicine.”
B EYOND COMPETITION.
The Waterbary Watches take front rank as
“the timekeepers of the day.” They are not
“English levers” made in Geneva, and puffed
into notoriety to enforce rales and ensure dis-
appointment. The factory, which is now turning
out over half a million of tlure watches per
annum—a production larger than that of any
other watch company in the world—is still unable
to keep pace with the demand, and has now
extended its operations into the very heart of the
cheap watch-making territory on the < outinent if
Europe, where it successfully competes with these
“English levers” on iqual terms. These are no
idle boasts, but stubborn facts, and we challenge
the refutation of these assertions. The Water-
burys (series hi, J, and L) are only nickel-plated
watches sold at a low figure, but th y get their
reputation from Ive purchasers and not the
owners of dead stock. They are far more reliable
timekeepers than half of the jewelled-all-over-
patent-halfcock-go-as-you-please-baik-action -hair-
trigger - compensated - lock - stitch - burglar - baits
made in Switzerland and Germany, and »o:d as
English levers. The Waterbary Watches have
nothing to fear from ridicule, no dread of ex-
posure. They are simply w hat they claim to be,
and defy competition.
These world-famed and time-tried watches may
be obtained from any respectable dealer or store-
keeper throughout the colonies. Prices : Series
E, the old favourite, 13s. 6d. ; Series J (gents’
size), and L (lad es’ size), the new short-winding,
stem-winding, and setting marvels, 225. Gd. each.
No watch sold as a Waterbury is genuine without
the word Waterbury and the interwoven letters
W. W. Co. printed in fine type upon its dial face.

THE PRAYER OF A RIGHTEOUS MAN.
(Reported by our Launceston Poet.)
Thau all-forgiving Lord of Love an ; d Light,,
Who when smitten didst not smite;
Thou who didst pardon one upon the accursed tree,
Eorgive to-night a viler thief than He ;■
A wretch corrupt in body and in heart j
A scavenger’s- cart j
A traitorous Judas; idiot, miscreant, fool,
Deformed, contemptible, a devil’s tool,
Ail eel whose slimy wngglings can’t be fixed,
An Ananias with a Human mixed,
A coward, sneak, a snake with venom stored,
Keviler of the Anointed of the Lord,
A LIAR I
Suffer him not to- be destroyed by fire !
Eorgive him ! Save him ! Bless !
Nevertheless —
Not my will, Lord, but Thy will be done t
If ThoU wilt cleanse this perjured Satan’s son
Make him so pure that lie may sit near Thee,
In Thy blest home, with Peter, Paul,- and Me !
If Thou wilt not,
Let Tommy Trot
His leprous soul with foulest evil crammed,
BE DAMNED !! 1
We* really must let this man unburden his
soul :—
Dear Bulletin, — As book-canvassing has had very much
attention in the Press of late, I crave a small space to
give some interes:ing information of a historical character
concerning book-canvassers. While I do not for a moment
shield book-agent impostors, I do know that many book-
canvassers have rendered great public service in the dis-
semination of unimpeachable books. Thousands and
hundreds of thousands of good books have been annually
sold to people who, but for the canvasser, would never
have bought a book. The indefatigable agents have been
the pioneers of education into the remote st parts of the
Country, in many cases long before the Minister or school-
teacher visited the locality. I feel sure it will be a sur-
prise to your readers to learn that so many of the greatest
lights of the world have been book-agents. Bonaparte,
after the siege erf Toulon, when a young lieutenant, was
too honourable to duplicate his pay-account, so took the
agency for the “History of the Revolution.” It is
also said that Bonaparte travelled with a “ Life
o'f Cjosar,” and his prospectus, with the names of
0.5 Of his subscribers, was buried at Ids side. Bismarck,
tne greatest diplomatist of the age, was a book-canvasser.
Also Presidents Grant, Garfield, Abraham Lincoln, Jeffer-
son Davis, the Lord Mayor of London for 1835
(Joint O'Kelly), also Dan O'Connell, Josh. Billings,
Mark Twain, Bret Harte, Bob Ingersoll, Horace
Greeley, Wii.iam Hearts the lawyer and statesmen of
New York City, Madame De Stael and Mr. Jamieson.
Columbus also travelled on a work of marine exploration.
Washington, prior to the fated Braddock expedition,
sold over 200 copies of “The American Savage” in a
thinly-settled country in Virginia. Jay Gould, Ralph
Waldo Emerson, and Longfellow were canvassers, and
tile latter's success was remarkable. There is now in
possession of t'ne Massachusetts Historical Society a
prospectus which the poet used, and on one of the blank
leaves are the skeleton lines of the celebrated poem
“ Excelsior.” Dan. Webster was a canvasser, and paid
Ills second term of tuition at Dartmouth College by selling
books. James G. Biaine began his business career as a
book-canvasser in Washington, selling the “ Life of
Henry Clay.” Many others who emblazon the pages of
history attribute their success to the experience attained
while engaged in the vocation of canvassing. On reflec-
tion as to the character of books sold by canvassers, it
is surprising how few unworthy hooks have been distri-
buted, while the most useful works have been dis-
seminated, and most of them have been specialities not
procurable in any shop. I write hoping that merit will
meet its deserts in the punishment of fraudulent book-
canvassers, while the honest toiler may be encouraged by
knowing that so many illustrious men of the world have
in their turn been hook-agents.—Fair Play,
[Next!— Ed. B.]
Macleay Argus “ exponentialises the
N.S.W. “ embezzlement epidemic ” by running a
heading labelled “The Defaulters’Column.”
Dear Bulletin, —Sorry for your remark*
after Robespierre, that you can’t be a friend of
the People and wear a belltopper, because Snow-
ball Henderson Africanus, Melbourne Cuss, has
therefore doffed his nail-can.— Demos,
“ A lawyer, as a party to a case, goes on
velvet.” So said Judge Molesworth, over the
Ferguson will case, Melbourne, apropos of Lawyer
Daly, and then he goes and mulcts him in £1500
costs. Audible sneeze from Daly, and it almost
needs another Raley ta carry him out.
The law making sheep-stealing .a capital
offence has not yet been removed from the Queens-
land Statute-book. What will anyone bet that
some squatter J.P. doesn’t agree to issue a war-
rant under the hanging Act for an offence of this
nature before the Shearers’ strike is over ?
This Manipur Disaster recals the worst in
Indian annals. It was the first Afghan Expedi-
tipn, 1842. Twelve thousand five hundred, in-
cluding camp - followers, were slain, mostly in
Kyber Pass, and only one individual escaped, Dr.
Brydone. Hence ensued the conquests of
Afghanistan, Scinde, Oude—and the Indian
Mutiny.
One of Melbourne’s honorary “ beaks '’re-
cently went out of Ins way to describe a depraved
little larrikinoss as “ a fine specimen of the Aus-
tralian Natives’ Association girl.” Which simply
made the old gentleman look stupid. Then a
branch of the A.N.A., spent a couple of hours in
railing against the traducer preparatory to de-
ciding that he was a nonentity, and qu’te mi-
tt orthy of their notice. Which made the young
gentlemen look stupid.
The wife of a workless London docker,
who appeared in a state of blue collapse from
hunger, and on seeing whom and hearing his
awful story the poor workmen of the jury actually
shed tears, recently bore triplets in a room which
contained nothing but a table and a chair ; every-
thing had been pawned for food—the windows
were dilapidated, the hearth was fireless, and the
elder children were crying of hunger. It was
elicited at the inquest that all the family had
been able to obtain for two days was “ a ha’porth
of tea, a ha’porth of sugar, and a ha’porth of
bread.” Yet the German pauper Battenberg and
countless other parasites of the worthless, scro-
fulous, miserly, gambling Royal Eamily annually
rob the State Treasury of thousands sweated out
of British flesh and coined from British blood.
Many people seeing the words “ Microbe
Killer” have been led to believe that it is a
disinfectant. It is not a disinfectant, but a
powerful medicine, for while it kills the germs of
disease, it does it in a different manner. It is
taken internally or applied externally as the case
may require. It attacks and kills the microbes in
the system which are the direct cause of disease.
After these germs are destroyed the medicine will
thoroughly cleanse the blood and tone up the
whole system—in short, it restores to a healthy
condition all the members of the body, Although
this medicine has only been for sale in Australia
a short time the constantly increasing sales bear
witness to the good it is accomplishing. People
who have been using the Microbe Killer for con-
sumption, kidney and liver troubles, indigestion,
and, in fact, for almost every disease, are loud in
their praises of its virtue. Being composed of
pure water charged with powerful germ destroyr
mg gases it is as pleasant to drink as pure spring
water, Bend for the book, ‘ ‘ History of Microbes
and the Microbe Killer,” posted free. The head
office is 40 Elizabeth-street, Melbourne, but
agencies have been established at 319 George-
street, Sydney ; 17 Hunter-street, Newcastle;
and 26 Queen-street, Brisbane, where the medicine

This i o"t of thibg, from an English society
paper, makes us think that “ personal loyalty ” is
getting considerably strained :
Her Majesty seats round her mahogany a Host of very
dirty feeders. In the first place, most Germans art! in-
clined to be pbrcine in their habits at table, and tflft
Serene Highnesses and morganatic monkeys Whom Per
Majesty is forced, for relationship’s sake; to incite, to
break bread with her, are among the dirtiest of these dirty
feeders ; for, grafted on their natural and inherent tiii-
dleanliness, is a priggish and devil-may-care independence
and audacity, and a dull, swaggering, self-asserting con-
tempt for the feelings and comfort of others, which is one
of the most marked attributes of the princelings 5h
question.
Great Scott! Arid only a few yehrs ago a prince
might have grabbed his hash with his feet, and
picked the vegetables out of his hollow tcdth with
both hands, and the papers would only have
remarked that his tact, elegance, and intelligence
shed a lustre around him and supplied a bright
and shining example fur all With whom became in
contact.

h The price I pai'l for Darkey ? Well, I’m blowed
If I can tell,
Becov I pot him dealing you see, boss—
I was always fond of dealin’ —as a boy I’d buy or
sell
With any other kid I came across.
“ You’re a scholar ; you can reckon up his figure
from the start : , ,
Ib< u lit a mare at Maffra, bay—bob-tail ; _
3he cost me seven sov'reigns and was branded With
a heart _ '
Near shoulder. Well, I rode her down to bale—
.< 4 n > there I met a feller on a big upstandin’ roan,
I swapped the mare for him. He didn't suit ;
His owner, from his back had twice that very day
been thrown,
I had to give him three-pounds-ten to boot.
u Throw me olf ? No, not exactly. Though he
tried it for a while,
But dropped it when he found it was no go,
Then I traded for a trotter that could do a level
In three minutes seven seconds— that ain’t slow!
“ But I didn’t swap him level; I put a saddle
down . . . ,
That cost three notes-receiving thirty bob
An a watch I raffled after-twenty members at a
cru vvn ;
An’ then I swapped the trotter for a cob
“ A natty little chestnut, but I bartered him off
quick
For a skewbald an’ a gun : I let her go
For a fiery little black horse that had got a nasty
trick
Of kickin’ every time he got a show.
“That gun was worth a fiver. I travelled round a
bit
An’ got another chestnut for the black,
An’ a bridle worth ten shillin’s; the chestnut was
real grit,
A well-bred, showy model of a hack.
“ But I traded her for Darkey, an’ a prize
retriever-pup ;
But trav’lin’ down to Toora it got lost.
I got eight notes with Darky, so, boss, reckon all
that up
An’ let me know exactly what he cost.”

Gov. Jersey is not a bad horseman, bub he
certainly looks anything but a good one. At the
review at Campbelltown he might easily have
been taken for a military Guy Fawkes. His
figure was as bent as Major I ongfield’s, and alto-
gether he was such a spectacle that the fluttering
plumes on his gorgeous hat seemed shaking with
laughter at the sight. Nevertheless he pulled
through all right, and was on hand to time at
luncheon.
Governor Hopetoun, attended by a mob of
fiery creatures in cocked hats, has laid the founda-
tion-stone of a Home for worn-out soldiers and
sailors. Not, of course, the common or field
kind of sailors, but the brave fellows who pass
their lives in polishing her Majesty’s guns and
fishing-up lost torpedoes from the bottom of
Hobson’s Bay. It has, we learn, long been a
reproach to Victoria— i.e., the Cabbage Garden—
that she allows her defenders to go on frightening
away the Russians without making any provision
for the time when they must hang their swords
and cutlasses against the kitchen-wall and tell
toothless anecdotes of the awful tilings they used
to do for the Hempire. While England has been
supporting Woolwich pensioners, and gloating
over pictures of those interesting old liars in the
illustrated papers, Victoria has altogether over-
looked the value of decayed heroes as advertise-
ments for the sham-battle business. But now she
is awakened to the necessity of having a few
veterans, so that the Governor and his leading
braves can make “ feeling references ” to the
United Service Home, whose inmates have served
their country so faithfully and well.” (Loud
cheers.) What troubles the authorities at present
is the absurd physical completeness of candi-
dates for the Home. They haven’t lost any
arms or legs, and not one of them has
had the middle of his back carried away by a
cannon-ball. As picturesque reminders of the
horrors of war, they can’t compare with the em-
ployes of an serated-water factory, most of those
latter being minus a few fingers or an eye at the
very least. Consequently, there is some talk of
making amputa ion of a limb indispensable for
veterans wishing to enter the Home, and the man
who has most limbs sawn off will get first choice
of rooms. The pubbc expect wooden-legs and
cork-arms of worn-out warriors, and unless the
old- ’uns can point to a lot of honourable scars and
bullet-holes, the public begin to wonder —very
properly, too —whether there is any sense in keep-
ing such people out of work all their lifet me.
This is a view of the question which the public
must not be allowed to take. Therefore, we may
expect to find that Dr. Fitzgerald, or somebody,
will be requested to visit the Vic. naval and
military forces from time to time for the purpose
of chopping a lump off any long-service loafer who
wishes to retire into the Home on his laurels.

Queen Victoria, had the “ Gondoliers’’ acted before her
lately at Windsor Castle — only the second occasion of her
seeing a play since Albert died, the other being the
comedy of “The Colonel,” by Bruce’s Co., at Abergeldie
Castle. The “Gondolier” people had a high old time,
being driven home to London in twelve omnibuses—out
of the taxes,
Here’s about Indian Viceroy Lytton—who now, while
British Ambassador at Paris, has just entertained Melba
—and the circus-rider, lair little Victoria Cooke, who
came over here with Wilson’s Circus. She was the wife of
Professor Schiemann, who succeeded Omar Kingsley
(Ella Zoyara) as equestrian director. The occurrence was
after tnat magnificent bogus Punch and Judy, the Im-
perial Durbar, at Delhi, where George Titheradge recited
the “Ode,” and medals were given out to all the nigger
princes. Lytton had some on hand and was bothered,
till the glorious idea struck him of stepping into the
circus-ring and presenting Victoria - not Her Majesty, but
Victoria Cooke—with one of the medals, as Empress of
the Arena ! Yates raked it up and ripped it open. What
a stinging satire ! You see, even Viceroy Lytton had his
tongue in his cheek at the Durbar.
“Carados,” of the London Refkreb, says: “Most
stranded ballet-girls that I have met are clergymen’s
daughters, and can do something else for a living.”
Lily Langtry’s dollars are going the way of those of
most manageresses. Her new play, “Lady Barter,” is
another black frost.
A Miss Kentish Moore, who was recently “ commanded’
to sing at Osborne, seems to have quite “ knocked ” our
Gracious Queen. The old lady rewarded her with a
diamond bracelet and a chaste salute on the cheek.
The late Barnum made more celebrity by his purchase
of Jumbo than by any of his thousands of better financial
speculations. And if that perverse beast (who after all
was only a trifle bigger than ordinary elephants) hadn’t
pitted himself against a railway train, there was a fortune
in him for the old showman. Jumbo possessed no feature
of interest, save the advertised fact that he was extra
large, a circumstance for which the world didn’t care a
straw until Barnum worked it up into a great Anglo-
American question. But the newspaper drivel, the stories
of how the British nobility sent barrels of oysters for the
elephant, in order that he might be “kept up” in the
hour of his departure for the Far West, all this bunkum
had sunk deep into the American soil. Englishmen
travelling through the States found themselves special
objects of interest. The girls would cluster round young
Adolphus and say—“l guess you’ve seen Jumbo—what’s
he like?” Whereupon the globe-trotter would expand his
chest and reply, “ Haw, a dem’d fine elephant, bai jove 1”
The great Melbourne alligator was found to have the
photo of a lady hidden away, together with 64 stones, a
yard of fencing wire, and other dainty morsels, in close
proximity to his “sweetbread.”
Lord Londesborough, who long figured as the king of
“patrons” of stage beauty, has become respectable, and
goes about with his daughters. It was Londesborough
who found the money for Boucicault’s production of
“ Babil and Bijou,” and the great Dion, being safely in-
stalled as lessee of the theatre (Covent Garden) soon
ordered his lordship to clear out from oehind the scenes.
Emily Fowler, Florence Gerard, and a whole lot of beauti-
ful girls were “ brought out ” by this long, lean, faded-
looking earl. Most of them developed into real actresses,
too.
Wybert Reeve now runs Adelaide Theatre Royal him-
self. His term commenced with the Cartwright-Nethersole
season. Wybert maintains his exuberantly youthful
style.
A Galway gossoon lately worked the slot trick to per-
fection. He used a hole-y penny with string attached,
put that penny in the slot, and drew his toffee, but pulled
the coin out again, and carefully repeated the perform-
ance until he had emptied the machine and was able to
start as a toffee-hawker. He was arrested for theft, but a
Galway Justice summed the matter up:—“Always be
dutiful and do exactly as you’re told, and no more and
no less. The inscription on the machine said : * Drop a
penny in the slot.’ Yezdidso faithfully and repatedly.
The inscription on the machine said nothing about lavin’
the penny in the slot when it was wanst dropped in. You
conformed with the rules and ye’ve won your prizes. Go
and prosper agin.”
Had Charles Coghlan, Mrs. Langtry’s leading man,
chaffed the counsel for his creditors, “played to the
house,” and treated his shameful indebtedness as lightly
in an Australian bankruptcy court as he did in a British
one, he’d have been promptly committed for contempt.
Possibly he’d have met similar severity in London had he
been a’ “thirty bob” instead of a fifty pounds weekly
man. Coghlan never kept any books or accounts; em-
ployed a Belgian chef, and occasionally, while mail-coach
driving for instance, nineteen other servants ; rented a
house at £2OO a year, also chambers for himself at a cost
of £4 w'eekly, and rooms at Richmond for his wife at £2 ;
occasionally owned ten horses and hired others; owed
everyone money, from tailor, butcher, baker, grocer and
governess down to washerwoman, and had apparently no
desire to pay anyone.
A Southern scribe writes that the “ distinguished ”
artistes who have emanated from Pollard’s Juvenile Opera
Troupe are Misses Pollard, Varley, Salinger, Trigge, and
Mackay. Mrs. G. B. W. Lewis trained Misses Graupner,
Brooke, and Mrs. Darrell. We don’t know who trained
the ruck. The schoolboy asks: “ What comes of the
figures when they are rubbed out 7’
G. V. Brooke was accompanied from London, in the
steamer Pacific, by Dick Younge and Fanny Cathoart.
Fanny broke her engagement, on marrying Bob Heir,
who was picked up in Australia, and taught by her
to act; but the grievance was that the Napoleon of the
Drama wanted to marry Fanny.
The Opera House pit, Melbourne, was edified the other
night by a bucolic mother, who fetched a bevy to see the
spectacle. Fair enough it was till she saw her first ballet,
when she “ shoved ” all her clutch away from the debasing
spectable.
The critics say that London nowadays wouldn’t tolerate
“The Bohemian Girl” or "Maritana,” from which the
greatness of Sullivan is presumable ; but we’ll wager that
“Maritana,” composed under Sydney’s sunny sky, is
alive and kicking in 1991, and “Ivanhoe” dead as an
a ntediluvian door-nail.
Boyle Ronertson Patey, Melbourne theatrical lawyer’s
clerk, has been at loggerheads with Crown Prosecutor
Smith, in the police court. Says Patey: “That man,
Smith.” J. T. T. fired up, and claimed Bench thunder-
bolts. Says Patey : “ You called me ‘ that man, Patey.’ ”
Roland for Oliver.
The four-year-old daughter of a well-known Sydney
opera singer woke her mother in the middle of the night
a few weeks ago with the question: “If God was Gentle
Jesus’ father, who was His grandpapa?” '
A London paper, having been idiotic enough to state
that Haddon Chambers, in accepting a commission to
write two plays for Daniel Frohman was “not doing him-
self justice in thus undertaking to write down to the
level of American audiences,” Frohman points out that
“The Idler” and “Maister of Woodbarrow”—two
London successes—were first produced in New York, and
the playwright himself asserts that he has “found
American audiences to be at once the most alert, appre-
ciative, critical and sympathetic of any to whom my plays
have hitherto been presented.”
Ushers who undertake to give bouquets to artistes ought
really to keep out of sight of the songstress, who (though
she, of course, knows all about it from the first) must be
more or less embarrassed when she sees the top fronds of
the lurking vegetables peeping round the door. It dis-
counts that charming look of surprise, too, and makes
people smile cynically.
Theatrical critics have a habit of perching together in
the dress-circle. They form a sort of conversational
stew-pan, and you can see the colouring through all the
reports. On the contrary, they ought to sit as separate
as biled owls, and glower at each other like Pott and
Slurk.
The Emperor Strikeablowonthegongwithafan of Japan
has just issued a decree, authorising actresses to appear
before the footlights at the same time as actors. Hereto-
fore, the co-operation of the sexes has been forbidden,
and when playing a love-scene the Jap. masher actor dare
not enter L.U.E. until the tomato of his soul had made
her exit R.L.E.
In a serious drama a prisoner was supposed to read
aloud a very long letter brought to him by the gaoler.
To save memorising, it was written out and one night
the gaoler, a practical joker, handed the prisoner a
blank sheet of paper. For a moment the prisoner was
nonplussed, but recovering himself and handing back the
paper, with a bow, said, “Gaoler ! I am obliged to make an
avowal to you. Brought up by parents of low estate, 1
do not know how to read 1 I beg that you will have the
goodness to acquaint me witn the contents of this letter.”
The snarer was snared, but his wit saved him, too.
After nervously fumbling the letter the gaoler Said,
“ Willingly, but I must go and look for my spectacles.”
George Olutsarn Anderson, one of the “perfesh,” In.®
just been acquitted by a Perth (W.A.) jury on a charge o*
forging and uttering a father’s consent to his marriage
with a minor. Anderson is a well-known impresario, and
some time ago visited far-off W.A. with an operatic com-
pany. Latterly he has been touring the provinces with
an amateur-cttni-professional team. The “minor” in
question was sweet 16, a member of the troupe, and
Well, marriages are made in Heaven, it is said.
Does anyone rem mi her Jemmy Stride, the celebrated
“ box-keeper ” at Drury Lane, in the days of Chatterton ?
Because he recently died at the age of 74. Jemmy was
celebrated for his hat and his wholesale distribution of
“ orders,” in which branch of usefulness the old character
was mainly employed. Stride’s tall silk hat glistened like
a steel helmet in his halcyon days. It was never spotted
by rain nor specked with dust, and anybody else’s hat,
being worn for the first time, seemed dull and gloomy in
the presence of this incomparable tile. The story went
that a private detective 'received instructions to discover
the reason of Stride’s hat, but could trace the mystery no
further than a certain shop, where every morning one hat
would be left in exchange for another of the exact same
shape and glossiness. Two or more hats were evidently
turn and turn about, but the special “ fake-
ment ” practised upon them remained a secret between
Jemmy and the shopkeeper who used him as an adver-
tisement. _ With his hat for a card of introduction
Jemmy ingratiated himself with the wealthiest
of the professional racing world and made a
practice of posting “orders” to people who
would respond to the summons in evening-dress and a
carriage. “Large and fashionable” audiences were
often brought together by Jemmy’s discreetly-placed
“ paper,” and it was a treat to behold him bowing,
smiling, and raising the renowned hat in honour of a
crowd of people who were going in “on the never.”
Once a year this master of the paper-hanging art enjoyed
a benefit, and he was original even in that. Instead of
waiting for his acquaintances to take tickets, Jemmy
posted tickets to them, just as many as he thought they
would pay for, and in fair proportion to the number of
orders they had respectfully received during the twelve
months. But it must be many a long year since
“ Stride’s Benefit ” breathed its last, and Stride’s hat
began to lose its lustre. There are no great, Napoleonic
“ box-keepers” nowadays.
They call the Queensland soldiers “ the
Offensive Force ” now.
Weighted down as most newspapers are
by the necessity of currying favour with adver-
tisers, of ignoring scandals against moneyed
persons and influential syndicates, and of cutting
their political coats according to the state of their
bank overdrafts, the sentiments of the majority of
the Australian press concerning the shearers’
strike may be condensed into—“ Bloodshed ? A
little bloodshed would do no harm, provided that
the right sort of blood is shed, provided that the
gore spilt is the common plebeian gore of low
unionists. But bloodshed of squatters? Or of
scabs? Murder —massacre—outrage—red revolu-
tion—demonry !” What is all this screaming
worth ?
Speakingat the recent big A. N, A. pow-wow,
at Ararat, ex-boss-native Purves, Q,C., replying to
the toast, “Australian Federation,” said among
other things that they could not always remain
an integral part of Great Britain ; and that “ one
of the main principles of Federation was a
universal fiscal policy—intercolonial Freetrade
and Protection against the outside world. Their
principal supplies were drawn from Great Britain,
and if they shut their doors against Great Britain
that meant fiscal separation. Let them not be
frightened at the word ? It meant separation.
They were only valued by Great Britain as con-
sumers ; and did they wish to be protected by
people whose goods they would not buy ? ” Which
shows a considerable change of front on the part
of the vacillating Australian Natives, whose new
president, Mr. G. Wise, talks like a straight-out
Republican.
Lars Peter Hansen is ordered to die for
the murder of his mate Duncker. He says he
killed Bucket in self-defence. The Judge re-
marked that any honest man who in self-defence
had killed another, would have given himself up
to the police instead of burning the body and
decamping. That argument is a specious one,
for there is after all no policy like that of
Bismarckian candour. On the other hand, how-
ever, there are many arguments, based on what
one hears of the style in which the law and the
police operate, that would tend to uncertainty of
action on the part of the weak man who found
him elf in so awful a position. The circumstances
under which Hansen killed Duncker in the lojiely
bush will never be known for certain. Meanwhile
the law has convicted, and is going to hang, Hansen
on a hypothesis which may be correct, but is just
as likely to be incorrect. You can logically
deduce nothing as to a man’s criminality from the
fact that he tells you lies when he finds himself
threatened with an ignominious death.
The N.S.W. Premier at St. Leonards :
I have been surprised to understand how some gentle-
men who ought to be independent had such a craving
desire to become members of the nominee Legislative
Council. I was once pestered by a gentleman to recom-
mend him for the Council. I turned the subject, but he
worked back to the question of his fitness for the Council.
He saw me again and again, and finally on one occasion
said that if a cheque for £lO,OOO were lying on the table
and if the written offer of a seat were also”lying there he
would take the seat and he did hot care who took the
cheque. That was rather stiff, and I then asked him not
to see me again. I cite this anecdote because it is within
the knowledge of several very upright men, and to show
to what lengths.men will go to get into the Legislative
[ Council for life and for enjoying the paltry prefix of the
honor.
The Bulletin candidly tells Parkes — the virtuous
person who had a miserable, simple-minded black-
smith prosecuted for bribery, because heofferedhim
£lO for Civil Service employ merit —that it doesn’t
believe him, and, further, that the public doesn’t
believe him. The public likewise considers that in
relating the story He committed a gross error of
judgment, considering how many large sums of
money he lias set down in his bankruptcy schedules
as due by him to men whom he appointed to the
Council aforesaid.
Backache, stitches in the side, inflation and
soreness of the bowels, are symptoms of a dis-
ordered state of the digestive and assimilative
organs, which can be corrected by the use of
Ayer’s Cathartic Pills.

Tales of the Old Regime,
No. V.— The Immersion of Captain Bankes.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
We were going to tell you to-day the story
of the loss of the George 111., but, on second
thoughts, instead, will narrate a story which in
itself is a not uncharacteristic expression of the
ways of the Old Regime, though, in point of grim-
ness, compared with the manner of the going-
down of the George HI., it is a glimpse of sunshine
in Cimmerian darkness. This incident happened
in the year of Grace 1823, while it was not till the
year of the System and the Regime 47—that is to
say, 1835 —Neptune, and , a subordinate of the
Regime between them by the agency of a sunken
rock and soldiers’ bullets removed 120 names from
the penal roll. What, their, has the one to do
with the other ? Nothing very much beyond this:
the man, an ex-Wesley an missionary, who tells
you, through our pen, the story of Captain
Bankes’ drowning, will also tell you of the drown-
ing and the shooting of the convicts whom the
men of the Regime killed in D’Entrecastreaux
Channel.
# # #
Captaki Bankes, indefatigable and esteemed
officer of the System, after a call of duty had
taken Lieutenant Darrell from the Settlement,*
felt somewhat lonely in his apartments on Sarah
Island. His quarters had once been graced by
the presence of ladies, but those representatives
of the fair sex he had been reluctantly compelled
to remit to Hobart Town in order that they might
be formally released on the expiration of the sen-
tences for which they had been transported. The
ladies in question had been two in number, and
notwithstanding the inducement held out to them
by Captain Bankes to remain, they were drawn
by the fascinations of the Capital to its pave.
They had every comfort at Macquarie Harbour
except that sweet solace of the feminine soul—
shopping. There were no shops at Macquarie
Harbour, save the butcher’s shop you must
not’ coitfound this with Gallows-place—though
there was a store. As a recreation, Bankes had
allowed them the run of the Store, and had even
gone so far as to procure for them from Hobart
Town sundry fal-di-rals, dress materials, and other
women’s gear, which the Captain, carrying his
gallantry still further, paid for through the
System by docking the men's rations or
clothing allowance. But Robertson’s shop in
Maoquarie-street they call it Ingle Hall
now, and Robertson’s cattle-brand has carried
the fame of the Oolag swards over the Aus-
tralias and Lewis I ', in Murray-street, em-
poriums, as they were, of the latest London and
Paris fashions —were irresistible, and, conse-
quently, the two beauties insisted upon being
returned to the Capital. Captain Bankes and
Lieutenant Darrell had seen them off by the
Cyprus, and the former had flicked his handker-
chief to them as the schooner passed the point of
Phillip Island.
“ Deuce take it!” said Bankes to Darrell, as
the women returned the salute, “I won’t know
what to do with myself, now that the girls are
gone and you are going after pine to the
Gordon.”
Darrell grinned. “Get some more,” he
suggested.
Bankes, slapping his hand on his knee, cursed
his own stupidity in not writing)' by the outgoing
schooner, to the Principal Superintendent of Con-
victs for a fresh contingent of Cyprians.
Resourceful Darrell was again ready with a
suggestion. “ Signal her back,” he said.
No sooner said than doneto the detriment of
Skipper Jobson’s temper, the vessel was recalled,
and told to wait for a fresh despatch. He was
going out on a fair wind, and with the tide in his
favour, but the couple of hours he lost in tacking
to secure Captain Bankes’ love-missive spoilt his
chances of a fair run. Which, of course, was
nothing to Captain Bankes.

Let us stand by the shoulders of Mr, J.
Fubster as he opens the letter :
Macquarie Harbour,
9th June, 1823.
Dear Fubster,—
In accordance with your official memo., as I have
officially written you, the women who have been down
here are returned for discharge by this boat. Like
a good fellow, arrange for two or three more to return
by this Cyprus. Thanks to your demand for more pine,
I have to send Darrell 30 miles away for timber, and,
therefore, I am entirely thrown on my own resources for
society. The Doctor is generally drunk—of course, Ido
not state this as an official complaint, for he might
retaliate by saying the same thing of me- and except for
some of the “ special”! convicts, there isn’t a living soul
I can enjoy a word of rational conversation with, and
then to give those fellows the run of Officers’ Quarters is
just to provoke discontent and rebellion among the
men whom (don’t laugh !-) I don’t honor with the privilege
of associating with me. Why, only the other night,
Darrell and I sent for Lavington and Arnold—you
remember the two doctors who were sent out for their
Dublin insurance swindle ?-to take hands at whist.
Lavington, like a fool, couldn’t keep the invitation to
himself, but must brag of it, so another fellow (a solicitor,
or barrister, or writer, or something) swore he shouldn’t
go. Lavington wanted to know how he was going to be
kept from going.
“I’ll show you,” said the other rascal, as he knocked
him down with the bed-rail.
Lavington is still in hospital, and I had to give the other
fellow fifty!, as a warning not to spoil ray card-parties in
future, for if there is a thing I do hate, it is playing with
or against dummy. But here lam rambling on and have
got away from the main point—which is, don’t let'ine be
lonely for long. You may have some little difficulty with
the superior powers, but you can get over that.
With kindest regards,
Ever yours faithfully,
(Sd.) Frederick B. Bankes.
J. Fubster, Esq.,
Prim Sup. of Convicts, H.T.,
For Ms private hand.
* * *
That esprit de-corps which is supposed to
exist among rogues was certainly not lacking in
the gentlemen of the Old Regime. And though
when Bankes’ despatch reached the city, Gover-
nor Sorell was in one of those cantankerous moods
which, really due to bile, be was accustomed to
attribute to virtue, and though on that account
he could not be depended upon to be complaisant
in the matter of the Commandant’s request, Mr.
Jaraes Fubster had to rely upon his own machinery
for transferring fdur female transports from the
Hobart Town factory to the Officers’ Quarters on
Sarah Island. To tell you the truth, we cannot
say that Mr. Fubster had occasion to put himself
to very much trouble to secure that end. There
were a few formalities to be gone through which
were rendered necessary by the circumstance that
the System had in such matters to display an out-
ward deference to decency, for the Harbour was,
officially speaking, a “male settlement,” pure and
simple. These, however, were summarily gone
through with the result that Jane Applegarth
(23), Minnie Reado (18), Fanny Cockburn (21),
and Julia Perry (26), were assigned to Mr. John
Smith, settler, District of Lake St. Clair, by
order of the Prim Sup. of Convicts. That was
formality the first, done to satisfy the conscience
of the Matron _of the Factory. Formality the
second was an intimation to the keepers of the
keys of the military chest, that he must requisi-
tion the Colonial Secretary for an order to send
per Cyprus “the wives of Privates Applegarth,
Reade, Cockburn, and Perry, men of the garrison
at Macquarie Harbour, to their husbands’)(quar-
ters.” You will have no difficulty in understand-
that Mr. John Smith and the quartette of hus-
bands were alike non-existent. They wefe official
fictions in fact. Mr. John Smith used often to
play the part of John Doe and Richard Roe in
the little games of the Regime.
It was in this way that Mr. Fubster obliged his
friend Bankes, and thus the Misses Applegarth,
Reade, Cockburn, and Perry who, new arrivals
from that dear land which had given thfem birth,
and then sought the first opportunity of giving
them death, and who had kissed their co-mates
and sisters in exile as they left the factory at the
Brickfields for the district of Lake St. Clair, were
somewhat surprised to find themselves ushered to
the Old Wharf, thence into a boat rowed by
prisoners, and taken on board the Government
schooner, whose “Blue Peter” was up for the
Hell of the Harbour.
In the fullest innocence of their true destina-
tion, moral and physical, these girls went on
board. They were received with nominal
courtesy. Fubster, in his solicitude for Captain
Bankes’ interests, had bestowed upon the
schooner’s skipper, a kindly and genial and
therefore unofficial hint, that a course of good
manners and chivalrous conduct was very desir-
able, and, consequently, from the skipper to the
mate, and from the sergeant of the guard to the
steward, the authorities of the schooner—who
were, let us say, pretty big authorities in their
way, for they had the power (and not infre-
quently exercised it) of dropping an ounce of lead
into a rebellious convict’s skull —acted on the hint,
and treated the young ladies with every form of
respect during the three weeks that the passage
lasted. The girls were thus induced to congratu-
late themselves upon the change in their circum-
stances. Seldom have congratulations proved
more premature.
* * *
When making Cape Sorell, at the entrance
to Macquarie Harbour, the girls ventured upon
deck, which they had been only occasionally
enabled to visit during the voyage owing to the
boisterousness of the weather. The wind had
lulled, and as the vessel tacked to and fro,
waiting the arrival of the pilot-boat, the girls,
holding on to a rope which had been run
across the after-deck for their convenience,
speculated as to their future. They had not
been long “out,” as has been said, but it was,
nevertheless, surprising that some knowledge
of the infamies of the Harbour Settlement had not
reached their ears. So, however, it was. For
aught they knew, the entrance to Macquarie
Harbour might be also the portal to that terres-
trial paradise, a good man’s home, where each
would be legally installed as wife and mistress.
They knew, certainly, that it was not thg way to
John Smith’s homestead, but they were unaware
of the thousand-and-one ways the System had of
disposing of the bodies and souls of the trans-
ports. And the politeness and kindness which
had marked the marine officer’s treatment of
them was such as to dispossess them of any par-
ticularly alarming ideas of the future that might
have awaited them. The Skipper, in response to
their enquiries as to what they would do at the
Harbour, had simply bade them “ wait and see !”
“You must know, my dears,” he said, pater-
nally, “ we never lets on as to what the big-bugs
do. You see they don’t like it, but don’t you be
fearful o’ nothink, pretties, for Cap’n Bankes is a
real gentleman.”
“Yes, he is a real orficer and gen’l’rnan is
Bankes !” corroborated Bowser, the mate. (The
conversation was at the semi-family gathering at
the cabin dinner-table.)
And the two men laughed. And the four girls
smiled —re-assured.
When the pilot-boat at last came up, the girls
saw seated in the stern of the boat a military
officer wearing an undress uniform, who, as soon
as he sprang up the schooner’s side, was respect-
fully saluted by Bowser, the skipper being down
in his cabin getting ready his manifest and other
papers.
“This ’ere’s a special honour, Captain,” said
Bowser —“yer cornin’ down with the boat. We
did not expect to ’ave the pleasure o’ seein’ you,
sir, till we got to the Island.”
“H’m. But I am rather anxious to see what
passengers you have.”
There were twenty-three prisoners down in the
hold, but the Captain did not mean them; those
were labelled cargo.
“ Four private sodgers’ wives, sir!” said Bowser.
Bowser, of course, knew better, but, then, he was
speaking by the book, or rather by the ship’s
papers. Bankes was not to know that he and his
skipper saw through the little game, as they did
see through it. Old birds are not to be caught
with chaff. For the moment Bankes, not sus-
pecting that Mr. Fubster had complied with his
request, by a swindle upon the military treasury,
was annoyed and aggrieved.
“ Four privates’ wives !” he repeated, in tones of
exceeding disgust. “You don’t mean to say,
Bowser, that’s all ?” Mr.' Bowser turned, and,
with a salute and a bow that would not have dis-
credited a master of ceremonies in the ball-room at
Government House, Hobart, or at a dance in the
Whitechapel Out, pointed out to Bankes the four
demoiselles who stood clinging to the rope, and
swinging gracefully with the undulation of the
vessel.
“Them’s the ladies,” says Bowser. “They’re
on the papers as sodgers’ wives, but I’m a-thinkin’,
sor, as that must be a clerical herror !”
* # *
Captain Bankes followed the direction of
Mate Bowser’s gesture, and took his cap off as he
approached the girls.
Quite the officer and the gentleman was Captain
Bankes ! So the girls thought.
# * #
“H’m,” said the Captain, bowing. “Ah
—h’m, very pleased to see you, ladies. Ah—eh—
let me welcome you —to —er—Macquarie Harbour.
Do hope you—er —haven’t had too rough a pas-
sage ?”
All the girls tittered, two curtsied, one found
her tongue and said—

conscious pride, for the words of the girl m their
intonatiori had savoured so much of a profound
reverence for his office. Like most other men in

saluted, m a somewhat surprised fashion. He had
not known that Bankes was on board, and .10 was
confoundedly sorry, as w«li as astonished, to find
the great man had come down with the pilot-boat,
inasmuch as the circumstance spoilt a little

not expect to see you here, sir, !
“No? But of course not,” said Bankes.
“ No a', what about these girls ?”
Two or three of the crow—prisoners —were
standing by the hatch, and Skipper Jobson felt

caution necessary, and accordingly paid tnat
homage to virtue which was one ot the best
features in the vice of the Regime.

Forgetting for the moment the presence of
the girls, Bankes leaned against the bulwarks
and, taking his keys from his pocket, opened his
despatch-bag. The big packages with the blue
wrappers he left for later inspection, but he looked
eagerly for the smaller enclosure which he knew
would be in it bearing the endorsement— “ Ca-

Of course he found it, and as we have already
exposed his own letter to your notice, it is only
right we should now permit you to glance over his
shoulder at Fubster’s reply§ :—■

Principal Superintendent’s Office,
Hobart Town, 21 | 7 | 23.
My dear Captain,—
Yours of the 9th June duly to hand, with the last
batch of despatches, and as you will see by this boat, I
have done my best for you. You asked for one, two or
three of the sex, but, as a touching proof of my friend-
ship, I have sent you four. They are all more or less
long-termers, so whoever you select for the post of house-
keeper, you will not be soon discomposed by having to
lose her. I send the four to give you every opportunity
of making a permanent selection, but, if on the other
hand, you want variety, that condition also will be met.
Of course, old man, Sorell doesn’t know of the business.
He is at the present time unwell, and, therefore, more
than usually inclined to put his foot down upon our
fellows, and I thought it best not to even hint to him
anything of your request, as, for one thhig, he is tired of
the present Madame at Gov. House, and were he to sus-
pect that there were four or five fine-looking ladies among
the factory mob, Pm afraid Madame would get her
conge, which wouldn't suit mo just now. As I could
not tell His Most Noble, I have had to work the usual
manoeuvre upon the matron, of the Factory, who has
just roused to a sense of her' sinfulness through
the agency of a Methodist humbug, named Turner.
Shouldn’t be at all surprised to find the old sinner
—I mean Turner, not the matron - has won over
theold woman to get the girls himself. You will phase
therefore note I have put you down as Mr. Smith, District
of Lake St. Clair—a gentleman I’m afraid who is rather
over-running his allowance of women convicts, as these
four make 35 within a few months. (You military gents
are too altogether luxurious.) I am sending them to you
as private soldiers’ wives. You will take care as (Military
officer in command to keep your records straight, for
your Major is talking of a trip to the Harbour to inspect,
and the paymaster for that reason will want a voucher as
to the girls’ passage. You can arrange so that the old
man shall not ask about the soldiers’ wives. Now as to
the girls, Cockburn is my fancy, she can piny, sing, and
dance a little. The accomplishments of the others are
very much a matter of opinion, but I should think they
all suit yon As soon as you are tired of
’nil, let me know, and if you can’t marry them down
there, send’em back and I will give “John Smith’’credit,
for their return. Now, as I have obliged you in this
little matter,“you must help me. Old Strode and I (not
the young one) have indented from home some capital
port, blit the quantity is larger than we ordered. Can
you do witli three dozen ? If so, don’t fail to let me know
what I shall charge them as. Don’.; let it be handcuffs
again this time, old fellow, or shirts—the Commissariat
can’t put through any more of either till (hey have
squared off the billiard-table account. Besides, one or
two expirees who were lodging with you say that you
didn’t give any fresh shirts for nine months. The Commy
people say you can have your choice of rice, leg-irons,
canvas trousers, serge ditto, and straw hats. The port is
86s. a n—that is what it cost us, and we will let you
mTwV'wnivf man'll not sa .Y Mis Most Gracious
Majesty won t touch the duty upon it. Old Knobvvood,
here at this moment-sends his pastoral blessing—hopes
you read prayers as per Regulation. Told him no doubt
of it. I must now close, wishing you joy and happiness
with the new arrivals.
Yours truly,
J. Fubster.
P.S.—Judge Field goes home shortly, and it is wins-
pered we are at last to have a charter of our own. If so,
it will not be long before we have a separate Government,
and then— i mention this so that you may be pre-
pared for developments.— J. F.

Captain Bankes, we say, read this letter,
and then, turning to Jobson ; “ Now, Jobson,
honour bright ! Have you and the mate there
treated those women—and me—well? ”
“ Honour bright, Cap’n ! I know yOu wouldn’t
like addled eggs !” ’
. * *
As the schooner, in charge of the pilot—
an expatriated Holyhead “ boy ”—ran up to the
Island, the girls had time to further discuss their
prospects, to watch Bankes as he opened, first one
official scrawl, and then another, and to observe
tho sombre outlines with which Nature closed in
the basin. Miles inland from the head of the
Harbour, the “Frenchman’s ” held up his “Cap”
of lofty, snow-decked granite, as though to salute
the weird genii of the neighbourhood. From the
Cap trailed streamers of greyish mist into the
scrubby gullies, and over the bald ridges of the
lesser heights. On the southern side of the inlet
the dark-green forests of myrtle were here and
there relieved by a flash of a softer tint, as an
occasional tall pine reared its pyramidal and
elegant form to which clung, pendulously, its rows
of tooth-edged branehlets. The more vivid gleam
indicated how the erratic laws of vegetable growth
had dropped into the midst of valueless scrub the
precious wood which could only be redeemed from
its worthless contiguity by the sacrifice of a
human existence; for it was a tradition amongst
the timber gang of tho Harbour that a tree which
had been so isolated by the time it had been
brought to market had cost some poor sinful Son
of the System his life. On the other side
tho aspect was even mote sombre. Where now
stands tlie township of Stratum, with its
hustling, bustling crowd of miners and miners’
parasites, there stood then, dense, impenetrable
blocks of blackwood, of ti-tree, and myrtle.
From the north and south there came shadow
and sombreness, but, right east, in the direct path
to the woody curve whence, so it seemed to the
girls’ eyes in the misty perspective, there rose the
half-veiled mass of the mountains, there lay Sarah
Island with its verdant base, and its superstrnc-
ture of brick and stone buildings, and high-paled
stockade. And upon that nest of misery there
rested a beam of sunlight which, had it broadened
its glory over the whole aspect of the Harbour
would, perchance, have cheered the most drooping
heart which was fretting away its tenderness
within the precincts of the Settlement. Cockburn,
pretty Fanny Cockburn, who had nourished her
stupid, little, fane ful brain, upon the novels
which taught tho lower and middle classes of
England how My Lord and My Lady loved and
lived in marble halls with wondrous tapestry on
their walls that had been fashioned by the fingers
of Queens, and so forth. This little girl, slim,
\va« Nr'i’vl.w. 1 Hetuen knows what
was lii i ciimc. probably, m being tho sport of
some great man s fancy and wickedness (Botany
Bay freed many a great man from an encum
brance), thought this athwart glance of sunlight
was ominous of good.
“See,” she said to Applegarth—“See, Janie,
that is the place, I ’spose ! Don’t it look bright
and gay ? Happy is the bride, they say, that the
sun shines on, and perhaps, you know, we may be
brides there yet.”
Poor wretch !—“ Brides !!”
# * *
Passing Kelly’s Basin ; Bankes once more
approached the girls. He felt he had made an
impression on one of them, at least, and his
masculine vanity being propitiated—he liked to
be loved for his own sake, did Bankes !—he felt it
was high time to assert his official character.
“Well, girls”—he spoke imperiously—“what’s
your names ? Yours !”
“Jane Applegarth, sir.” Jane answered re-
spectfully enough, but Bankes voted her truculent.
He meant virtuous —he knew something of the
sex.
“ You must answer more civilly, my girl, if you
don’t want your head shaved.”
The tears rose to Applegarth’s eyes, but she
forced them down resolutely, and answered noth-
ing.
“ Yours ? ”
“Fanny Cockburn, sir— C-o-c-k-b-u-r-n, sir.”
Fanny was proud of the orthography of her name
(she was not a common Coburn) and replied
minoingly, her eyelashes the while half-veiling
oh ! such a killing look. Fanny would have flirted
with the hangman on “ her day.” ||
The Commandant twitched his moustache.
That was Cockburn then —Mr. Fubster’s “ fancy.”
Well, seeing as he did eye to eye with the Prim
Sub. of Convicts in many things, he did not
hesitate in permitting his judgment to coincide
with that esteemed friend’s in the matter of
Cockburn’s charms.
“ Er—please stand aside, my de—, my girl.”
“Yours?” to the third girl. Minnie Reade
answered.
“Then, you are Perry ?” to the fourth.
“Yes, sir, please—Julia Perry.” This with a
curtsey ns graceful as the shifting deck wculd
allow.
“ And what can you do, Perry !”
“ Knit, sir, and sew, and cook—”
“Yes, yes; I know. All women can do these
things, I s’pose !” Bankes answered, impatiently.
“ But what else can you do ? I make men do that
sort of thing here !”
Perry (infanticide, “lifer”) a quiet damsel,
with features not so much pretty as pleasing, was
about to respond, when the big-boned and large-
hearted Jane intervened.
“ She can’t do nothin’ else, sir !”
“Who asked you to speak, madam? Under-
derstand you’re here to be spoken to, and not to
speak. ”
“ I know, sir!” Again the tears rushed for-
ward to blind the courageous girl, and again they
were sent back by her resolution that she would
do her duty. She spoke submissively but with
firmness.
“You do know ! Then why do you not let
Perry answer for herself? What can you do,
Perry ? Can you sing or play the harp ?”
“ Oh, sir, No! But I would make a soldier a
good wife, sir, I would ! I wouldn’t go wrong
again, sir.”
§The original of this letter is in existence, and is

“Wife!” Over the beat of the surge, and the
rustle of the cape-pigeon’s wings as in a dense
flock they followed the schooner to her anchorage,
resounded the derisive laughter of Captain Bankes,
Commandant at Macquarie Harbour.
“Wife! That is rich, ray sweet lass! We
don’t marry, except over the broomstick, here.”
* * *
The waves caught and sent back his
laughter, and the woods returned the echo of his
words—but all the women, even the Cockburn,
looked as though they heard not, for they were
stunned at the brutal avowal. Applegarth, who
had suspected from Bankes’ opening words
something, felt the shock most acutely. Neverthe-
less, she was the first to speak.
“ Then—what—are we - to be, sir ?”
There are some terms which were appropriately
included in the vocabulary of the high-toned
parties of the Old Regime, probably in order that
they should be at no loss to understand the dialect
of Tophet on their arrival there, but which, never-
theless, are yet not to be mentioned in decent
society.
Captain Bankes’ reply consisted of one of these
words.
“Never ! ” said Applegarth. Cockburn put her
hands before her face—prettily shocked; the
others burst into tears. Jobson laughed in concert
with the fine young British gentleman of the new
colonial time.
* * #
“Never!” Jane had said.
(( Captain Bankes forgot his manners, and swore.
Damn you, you jade. You —— ! ” The
emphasis he placed upon that unreputable ropeti-
®l(® •. “Well see ! Jobson, put her in irons !”
(( Sir !—Captain Bankes ! ”
As I order, sir, and no nonsense ! ” He
dropped the despatch-bag which he had held in
ms hands up to that moment, and from a pocket of
his uniform-coat, drew out a pair of darbies and
advanced to where the dauntless girl was asserting
her own and her co-transports’ Womanliness—
But out your hands!” he commanded. The
girl answered him by putting one behind her ; the
other still clung to the rope.
Bhe was on one side—the tiller side-of the
rope, and he was on the other. He stretched out
ms hand to grasp hers, when the Skipper- who
ia , in his heart, resolved to outer into relations
V l6 fjrls, Applegarth for choice—
caned to the helmsman to “Luff!” The com-
and was, doubtless, necessitated by the exi-
gencies of .seamanship, but it had the effect of
upsetting Mr., Bankes’ foothold and his dignity,
f in ,® , e luffing of the craft, the Commandant
lS i° ut o ® l a _t file rope and the girl’s wrists,
‘ J f '“ a heap of incensed officialdom at Apple-

portant to the System, though, possibly, other-
wise valueless. And into the boat he was dragged,
shivering from his immersion, but warm with a
malignant heat at the outrage.
“ Murder ! Attempted murder !” he panted, as
way being stopped on the; schooner, he was hauled
on board the larger craft. “ I’ll have her life !”
Applegarth, pale and faint on the recoil of her
effort, heard him.
“ Do, coward ! —Cnr ! But if you come near me
again, or these girls, it’ll be yon who’ll be killed !”
“Iron her, Jobson, iron her !” ordered the mad-
dened, dripping Commandant.
“ Yes, iron me—iron a woman ! Why don’t you
say you’ll flog me, and brand me, and then hang
me ! ”
“By I will, too, you she-devil ! Bowser,
the bracelets, man, quick—where are they ? ”
Bowser was hard put to it to restrain a grin.
Still he respectfully answered : “ They went over-
board with y’r Honor, sir.” He was ordered to
bring another pair.
“Bring your darbies!” cried Jane. “Yes,
bring ’em, but if you put them on me, sir, I’ll
drown you first chance I have, if I’ve only two
inches of water to do it in !”
Then, turning to the girls she clasped the
nearest of them to her, hysterically. “Oh, my
dears—don’t go with him —that man—that officer
- oh, girlies, let’s be true to one ’nother—- let’s
keep straight!’’
# # #
But—a soldier of the guard tore her away.
And the Sergeant himself placed the darbies on
the strong wrist that had worked such havoc.
But —the darbies being on, did Jane Applegarth
ever get an opportunity of carrying out her
threat, or, having got pije, did she avail herself of it?
She was granted the one—at least there were
nine inches of water olf Limeburners’ Point —and
she had the other—-that is to say, she drowned
Bankes, Officer and Gentleman, off the Point. The
manner thereof we will tell you some other day.
Before she drowned him, she had by his orders
been shaved, branded, flogged !
Of such were the Men of the Regime.

Dear Bulletin, —I have just read Stan-
ley’s letter to the Times, dated from Washington,
B—l2—'oo. Perhaps, like Lord (in posse) Henry
Parkes, he does not read The Bulletin. But
many Bulletin readers see the Times, and I wish
to call their attention to the curious position in
which Henry Morton Stanley places himself. He
commences fairly by upholding British enterprise.
Was his a British affair? Then he states :
Beyond and above any personal question whatever
stands the honour of the English name.
What have poor Scotland and Ireland done to be
left in the cold ? And the joke is that H.M.S.
(by the way, those letters do for a lot of spittle-
licking) is, if hiled and the Yankee skin scrubbed
off, a Welshman. So the leek-eaters are out of it
also. They’ve no honour to hold above the
butcher’s “ personal question,” whatever that may
be. Now read this :
On the other hand, there have been many English
explorers, from my revered master, David Livingstone,
down to my own comrades in the advance-guard of this
expedition, who have united in quite a singular degree
gentleness with valour.
When was Livingstone Stanley’s master ? and in
what ? I don’t think he taught him bunkum and
bravado and butchering to begin, and snuffle to
end? And he, D.L., was a Scotchman. How
well I remember when he addressed the students
at home and each one had a slip of paper pre-
sented to him on which were some dog-Latin
verses by Jimmy Neaves (son of Lord Neaves).
Livingstone was Scotch enough then. The poem
began :
In hallo communi quum speaket Livingstonus,
Si quis studens clamabit aut utteret groanas
Aut picchabitur peasas aut aliquid throwando
Aut benches aut flooros aut uprowum kickando
Creahit annoyance ad alios studenses
Senati oh ! gemini! him bringabit ad senses.
And so on. Then Stanley goes on with lots more
about English actions, and near the end says :
Africa is inhabited not by timid Hindoos or puny Aus-
tralians. ■
There you are, you A.N.A.’s, and listen :
It is by moral superiority, first of all, that that control
must be won, as it has been won, and must be main-
tained, as far as any white man can hope to maintain it.
Yours truly,
Henry Morton Stanley.
Washington, Dec. 8, 1890.
Now, I was in Africa and there was a man called)
as far as I remember, H. M. Stanley there, and
lie wore store clothes and jack-boots, and spoke
(put on) through Ids nose, and was an honorary
member of a mess (Madras Sappers) in which, I
also had the privilege of eating my rations and
sand and drinking my allowance of a gallon and
a half of aqua distillata per diem. But I was
standing a bottle of Sirapkin (Indian for alleged
champagne) to one Lee, of the Royal Engineers,
and unluckily was called out on duty. The fizz
had been appropriated by what Lee called “That
damned cad of the New York Herald,” and
absorbed by “moral superiority.” About a week
afterwards one of my (Government) mules had his
control iron and maintained by some infernal
camp-follower of the Welsh - Yankee-English-
whitewash type. I forget his name, but his initials
were N.Y. Herald. It is such pleasing mi inis-
conces as these that make history and a proud
name for a hero.—Yours, Scotty the Wrinklkk.

was with Stanley in Africa.” So I was— in ’fiS,

Dear Bulletin, — Rodney Claude Spencer,
who was condemned to death for murder, but
whose sentence has now been commuted to
“ life,” did not, as appears to be generally sup-
posed, belong to an aristocratic family. “ Rodney
Claude Spencer” is only a fancy name of his.
“ Jimmy Donaldson ” was nothing if not “flash.”
At one time his alias was very heavy and cumber-
some, and ran—“ Christopher Augustus Rodney
Claude Spencer,” but after a time he dropped the
Christopher Augustus, and kept the rest. In a
tree growing on the bank of a creek which runs
into the Roper River, N.T., there is an inscrip-
tion (overgrown now, I expect) setting forth the
virtues of the said C. A. R. C. Spencer, alias
Jimmy Donaldson ; also the fact that he was
known as the Aramae circus-rider. He was
clever on horseback, although not a good rider.
Now I come to think of it, poor Barney Keighran
lies buried close to the same tree. Jimmy is a
Queenslander, and has followed a variety of
occupations. He was something of a runner, and
once had a match with one George Cook, the
result whereof was a lot of ill-feeling between
R. C. .Spencer and several of the old hands.
One of these met him one day and “got onto
him ” about the race, and from words they came
to blows. Rodney could talk, but when it came
to fighting he generally trusted to his speed, and,
as a rule, got well out of danger. He ran well in
this instance, and his enemy followed him. There
was a good-sized water-hole near where the dis-
pute took place, the banks of which were nice and
smooth. Rodney made for this and took a gentle
canter round, eventually getting so close to his
opponent from behind that ho thought it time to
turn back and meet him at the other end. This
did not last very long—the “ pursuer ” was soon
exhausted, while the “ pursued ” was perfectly
fresh ; and then the absurdity of the situation
dawned upon the “old hand,” who sat down and
swore. “To think,” as he afterwards said, “ that
I should have been such a fool as to rim after
him, and all them other coves standing, laughing
at me.” The N.T. was a jolly place in those days
but the “grog was terrible.” —Elsie.

The Baccarat Scandal.
Amongst other French papers, LTngenue has
given its version of the baccarat scandal started
at Tranby Court We make the following free
translation :
“Odds fish!” (hereditary oath of the Royal
family of England) cried the Prince of Wales,
rolling his “ r’s ” as habitual with him when in a
passion or excited by a more tender sentiment.
“Odds fish, Sir Cummings, you have cheated!”
“ A thousand million sabretaches, my Lord,” re-
plied Sir Cummings, “you have lied.” “Let
him be conducted to the Tower,” ordered the heir
to the Crown, doubtless forgetting in his rage
that the Tower was no longer a prison but the
convenient and comfortable residence of an
American millionaire.
“The Duke of Coventry—to whom persons
seldom speak first—was consulted, and finally a
compromise was arrived at. ‘ Zounds, Sir Cum-
mings, ’ said the Prince, ‘ you must sign a paper
by which you bind yourself to commit suicide in
three months, and we swear to you that we will
faithfully keep the secret. On this condition our
friendship will be maintained according to the
code of honour practised in England.’ Sir Cum-
mings signed the fatal paper, put on his dress-suit
for dinner, and all of them continued to live in
the most amicable relations to the end.
“ But one will ask how the incident occurred ?
“ This is how.
“The financial position of the Prince leaves
much to be desired. Thus he finds himself com-
pelled to travel about to the ‘ country houses ’ of
rich parvenus, carrying with him his carpet-bag,
a green cloth and some counters. Asa rule the
stakes are modest, but on this occasion they were
very considerable. They played for ‘ bobs ’ and
demi-bobs ’ (as they say among the big people of
England). The Prince kept the bank, and, having
lost the ‘coup,’ paid a ‘bob’ to Sir Cummings,
who said to him, ‘ My Lord, you still owe me two
‘bobs.” It was then that the Prince exclaimed
* Oddsfish.’ It was thus that the storm burst.
“At the end of the three months agreed upon
Sir Cummings did not blow out his brains, and it
was then that the secret was divulged.
“What,* then, had prevented Sir Cummings
from faithfully carrying out his word ?
“He went to visit Monsieur Stead, the vir-
tuous proprietor of the World, a political journal
and a competitor of the Times, and this worthy
man assured him that cheating at a game was not
a crime involving suicide. ‘Co and consult Sam
Lewis, our great lawyer,’said Stead, ‘and Lord
Charles Russel, the celebrated barrister.’
“The interview with Mr. Sam Lewis was very
short. ‘ Sign me this small piece of paper, ’ Sam
said to him, presenting him with a sheet on which
were three letters—l. O.U.
“ Sir Cummings signed. Now the case will be
carried before the Queen’s Bench and tried before
f a jury of matrons.’
“What the Prince most fears is having to
appear before this jury of matrons.
“ The poor Sir Cummings has recently signed so
many little bits of paper that if one meets him he
hastens to say ‘Do you wish me to sign any-
think ?’
“ Look for the woman. This is the last word
about the incident. They assure us that Lady
Cummings, the young and beautiful wife of Sir
Cummings—but hush ! we decline to reproduce
the scandalous reports that are openly circulated

Sydney Evening News, in a burst of
righteous indignation against the local traffic-
inspectors:—
This morning, at 9 o’clock, when the street was
crowded, a horse and cart driven by three grown-up
larrikins, at the intersection of George and Bathurst
street, narrowly escaped running over several persons,
and then drove down the street laughing.
Good old Alfred !
The prison newspaper is becoming an
American institution. It began in Elmira gaol,
New York, with a journal called the Summary,
edited by a literary burglar. The thing proved
so beneficial that since this time, 1883, most of
the big gaols have their newspaper, gratis, amid
the prisoners. The editor is allowed the run of
the best current newspaper literature, but it’s'the
judicious gaol-news that takes. Of course, the
Society racket can’t be carried too far.

Melbourne Herald moralises thus; —
“The reputation of a man is like his shadow-

to turn round ?
Justice Innes, in sentencing three young
men to five years each for assaulting a loose
woman at Sydney, expressed hisj great wonder
that*the tragic result of the Mount Rennie case
“had not been a solemn warning to the youth of
the colony.” The Mount Rennie catastrophe has
been a solemn warning—to juries, as in the case
before Judge Innes they ignored the capital
charge, which Was proven in at least two cases,
and found a verdict on the lesser count.
Ask for Wolfe’s Schnapps anfl take no other.
John Wilson, a middle-aged man, sen-
tenced to death at Ballarat for assaulting girl
six years old, had been convicted twice previously
and had served 10 years with two floggings, and
six months for similar offences. You can’t flog

Zouroff to Fuchsia Mull, when that uneopventional
duchess threatens to take away his bruised
Yera. “No, in my country they lynch 'such
creatures as you,” chips in Fuchsia. And the
virtuous pit rises at her like a piece of puff-pastry
rises in the oven.

, The Chinese; :
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as 'uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the remainder that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is air aggressive Democratic
paper which strives ,to exclude from its- artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is nob
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started eleven years ago with no capital bub brains>
and has become a vast property, because it pos.
sesses a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent large fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that every
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now ail dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the ofie completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have spent some
thousands of pounds in fitting their buildings
with the latest appliances for high-class printing
and the production of illustrations, and they have
now issued The Bulletin in an entirely new
form—printed with new type of improved legi-
bility on the finest paper, and adorned with
sketches from the hands of the ablest and best-
paid newspaper artists Australia has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its earefer, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the "fact that' for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The Bulletin is the beacon-fire of national
progress: it is the forceful summons to the
crusade against the monopolies in land, wealth,
power, and privilege—the direct cause of half the
misery which now afflicts British humanity.
Against the claims of avaricious clergy who olaiip
to monopolise salvation, against the dark despotism
of grasping plutocrats, and against the exercise of
any human authority which has*not been granted
by the people over whom it is exercised* The
''Bulletin will fearlessly and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from th 6 columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by ifa
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners pa the streets of every Australasian
capital,de the most widely-circulated 6f all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only’
Australasian publication which enjoys, a popu-
larity Unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals tO the
colonies in which they are'printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally fapjiliar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman'
of Central Australia, the pearl-shejler. of Torres
Straits, and the digger m the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the roost
popular oity publication and the organ of the
intelligent bushman"must indeed be broadly based
Perhaps the strongest proof of The Bulletin's
popularity is found in the unchallengeable fact—
easily ascertainable from any postal official —that,
of all journals issued in Australasia, The Bul-
letin is the one most frequently remailed from
one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is mosji frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its* vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

SWORN CERTIFICATE.— One of Thousands more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugelmann, Esq.
Dear Sir,—This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. 1 consulted
more than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, but I became worse every day, wasting away until
1 became a perfect skeleton. Ahou t February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Retiring of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
ami went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. Prom that time I commenced to improve, anil
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever.
P. KEENAN.
