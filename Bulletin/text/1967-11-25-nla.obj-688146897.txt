A little of this. A measure of that.
Hennessy cognac is a master-
blend of old brandies . . . drawn
from the largest and finest reserves
in the world. That’s why the subtle
excellence of Hennessy cognac
never varies.
And that goes back to when
Hennessy started distilling brandy
in the district of Cognac before
Napoleon was born.
Hennessy Cognac is distilled and
blended in Cognac. No Cognac
could be more French.

ONE MORE
WEEK
APPRECIATING ART
LAST WEEK when BHP reached its
highest price ever the Clune Galleries
fought back gallantly with an advertise-
ment in the financial pages pointing
out that the capital appreciation of
several artists can match the growth
of the leading Australian mining shares
over the past five years.
For art-lovers, the list is: Blackman,
Boyd, Dobell, Drysdale, Fairweather,
Gruner, Herman, Martens, Miller,
Nolan, Olsen, Perceval, Roberts, and
Streeton. “Give yourself a capital gain
with an additional bonus,” urges the
Clune Galleries. “Enjoy your invest-
ment at home with your friends.”
To amend the old saying, I don’t
know much about art, but I do know
something about appreciation.
FREE TRADE
THE 12,000-ton freighter Tarn
brought 45,000 gallons of fresh Sydney
water to Melbourne last week. Mean-
while, Melbourne sent 1350 gallons of
beer for the AJC meeting at Warwick
Farm. What’s more, under the new
airlines one-bag-any-weight rule every
passenger to Sydney has taken at least
a dozen bottles emergency ration. Mel-
bourne and Sydney do not always see
eye to eye, but there is something
beautiful in each catering for the other’s
thirst.
LANII COVE RIDDLE
THE CATALOGUE at Melbourne’s
Tolarno Galleries said, “Four Sydney
Painters—Clifford, Peart, Shead, and
Taylor.” A rather odd group since all
they appeared to have in common was
geography and a not uncommon cir-
cumstance of age. All are under 35.
The range of style ran from abstract
expressionist to narrative macabre.
Shead was the grim storyteller.
His series of five paintings was
titled “Lane Cove Riddle 1,2, 3,4”
and “Early Photo.” One of the paint-
ings shows two streams flowing into
a pool and in dim light. In the pool
is a naked woman. Down in the corner
of the composition is a man’s bare
head and shoulders.
Two of the other paintings are
female nudes, lush and ugly, reclining
in sexual poses. Another is a semi-
nude of a woman in the last stages
of stripping off. The shadow of a
man is heavy in the foreground.
The title “Lane Cove Riddle” pretty
clearly suggests what the paintings are
about. Any doubts about this are dis-
pelled by what Shead has written on
the back of three of the canvases. On
the back of one is printed, “The couple
walked 150 yards from the car to
secluded spots 17 yards apart, indicating
they were seeking privacy from each
other.”
On the back of the painting “Early
Photo” are the words, “A reputable
well-spoken young woman with a college
education brought up by loving and
highly respectable parents in a large
house with a tennis court set in spaci-
ous grounds in a secluded part of a
suburb.” The sentence on the back of
another begins, “The couple left the car
to find privacy in the bushes . . .”
A Melbourne art critic wrote of
Shead: “The mysterious murders of
Gilbert Bogle and Margaret Chandler
at Lane Cove provide the strong liter-
ary content of his work.”
CITY STORIES
“I THINK I’d have been more excited
about this book if it’d happened earlier.
It seems too late somehow.”
Thelma Forshaw, the mother of two
children, the elder 14, has just pub-
lished her first book—a collection of
short stories titled “An Affair of
Clowns.”
They are vignettes, sketches, brief
looks at life, or life as it is lived in
Sydney by the bookish child of a
rambustious Irish-Catholic family,
women in love, women out of love.
They are sometimes intense, sometimes
funny, a little like Thelma Forshaw her-
self. And except for “On Our Safari,”
which is set on a farm, the noises of
the city are in all of them. “We had
always lived within the sound of a
crowd’s roar,” she says in one.
“That’s true. At Bondi, near Leich-
hardt Stadium, Harold Park. I think
we moved all over the Western Sub-
urbs. My family loved moving. I went
to Catholic schools, public schools, all
kinds of schools.”
The stories, written sporadically over
the past ten years, have all been pub-
lished in magazines, and the family
stories which form a sequence titled
“Some Customs of My Clan” were
originally part of a novel Miss Forshaw
abandoned.
“I’ve started to write three novels—
and tossed each one out because it
wasn’t working. They seemed too
strained —they had none of that quality
of deadpan ease that I think the
stories have.
“I’m going to try another one,
though. I’d like to write about a
mental hospital—or not a hospital—a
kind of half-way house. These places
help you when you’re feeling very low
and prevent a real breakdown.”
As Mrs. George Korting, she lives
in a quiet street in Lane Cove, a
w r orld away from the bustle of the
childhood stories. “It took me a long
while to get used to the quietness, I
admit. Even after I left home, I
went to live in the Cross —part of
what we felt was a bohemian group
at that stage.
“The others talked all the time about
literature —had opinions on everything.
But I was very empty-headed then. Like
the‘Straw Man in ‘The Wizard of Oz.’
I’d always been writing—ever since I
was about seven —but I had absolutely
no critical faculty until I turned 30.
Yet even now my literary tastes
haven’t changed that much. My
favorite books are still ‘Jane Eyre’ and
‘Moby Dick’.”
Her characters are people she’s
known, heard about, or perhaps seen
in the street or on a 'bus. And getting
them down on paper takes discipline.
“I procrastinate. Then, once I start,
I rough it and rewrite it five or six
times. I’ve only ever written one story
without pausing. I suddenly felt like
writing, so I locked myself in the
kitchen for a whole weekend.
“Otherwise, things get in the way.

“Barman, I’ll have a

“Sorry, Sir, there’s no
Campari left.”
“That’s too bad it’s
so gloriously pink and
cryptically bitter. All
right, I’ll try it with
vermouth and ice.”
“But I said there
wasn’t any Campari.”
“Oh I see. Did you
know it was made with
herbs from four con-
tinents macerated in
pure grape spirit in
oaken vats? 0.K., give
me Campari and gin
and don’t forget the
ice.”
“Listen. There-is-no-

No more. None left.
FINISHED! We have
everything else, but no
Campari.”
“Oh very well then,
I’ll have a Campari.”

EITHER A LITTLE LIBERAL . . .
LIKE FATHER, like son, even goes
for the politics of Australian university
students. According to a survey in the
November edition of “Politics,” the
journal of the Australasian Political
S t u d i e s’ Association, Melbourne
students, typically living at home with
middle- to upper-middle-class parents,
reflect their parents’ political attitudes
in favoring the Liberal Party two to
one.
Tony Staley, lecturer in Political
Science at the University of Mel-
bourne, investigated the small per-
centage, roughly 2.5 percent, of students
who are active in political clubs, who
will probably be active one day in
national politics. His subjects were 30
ALP, 28 Liberal, and 10 DLP students.
An interest in politics was about the
last reason these students joined politi-
cal clubs. The reasons were personal,
such as to meet girls, because of girls,
with a job in mind, or as rebellion
against parents. They knew little about
their party and felt no great emotional
attachment to it.
But when Australia and other coun-
tries were mentioned, then the students
expressed definite and extreme views.
Most students seemed to see the rela-
tionship between America and Aus-
tralia as similar to that between their
parents and themselves; as a result,
they disliked America intensely. Britain
they felt sorry for, as they would for
a senile grandfather. China was a bete
jaune for most of the DLP, half the
Liberals, and one-sixth of the ALP
members; one-third of the total survey
feared China and one-third did not
know.
Australia most clearly differentiated
the Liberals from the ALP. Only one-
sixth of the ALP students showed the
optimism of half the DLP and over
half the Liberals for Australia’s “enor-
mous potential” and “great role.” One
Liberal said: “She’s just a baby! It’s
lovely watching her grow!”
Mr. Staley divided the ALP students
into 12 rebels, whose parents vote
Liberal, and 18 non-rebels, one of whose
parents at least votes ALP. Three-
quarters of the rebels but only one-
sixth of the non-rebels had totally nega-
tive views of Australia as a country
which is “frightened” and “lacks initia-
tive.” All the rebels with one exception
had had breakdowns in relationships
with their parents, whom they felt had
been either too hard or too soft. The
rebels also admitted such problems as
loneliness and difficulties with the
opposite sex, but they only became out-
spoken on the shortcomings of Austra-
lia. “In talking about Australia,” says
Mr. Staley, “they were talking about
themselves.”
MAN'S MAN
“I BEGAN my career in ‘I Married
a Monster from Outer Space,’ ” Ty
Hardin told us as he flicked a whip
across the length of his room at
Sydney’s Hotel Menzies. He was
exhausted, and whip-cracking to keep
on his feet: the combined hazards of
Sydney star-grabbing had proved more
taxing than doing his own stunts in
“Bronco,” plunging down a cliff into
an icy river in full battle rigout in
“The Battle of the Bulge,” and braving
a tightrope, as well as Joan Crawford,
in “Berserk,” a story he described as
“a ‘Psycho’ of the circus.”
Hardin trounced Warner Brothers,
which produced “Bronco,” for parsi-
mony: “They cheesepared. Cut corners.
Stars had salary cuts and no residuals.
And that’s what’s wrong”—a fierce
crack of the whip—“anything it can do
cheaply it will. It’s cheating the public.
And ‘Bronco’ made $lB million for
Warners.” And what was wrong with
Hollywood was the stars’ fault as well:
“They want so much money there’s
nothing left to make the picture with.”
As he talked about American film-
making, Hardin’s eyes became a colder
blue and he kept looking in the mirror
and cracking the whip, almost as though
studying the extent of his own dislike.
When we reached “PT 109,” the story
of President Kennedy’s wartime
exploits, in which Hardin played Ken-
nedy’s executive officer, his jaw turned
to rock. “First of all, the picture should
never have been made. Second, it
should have been better made. Third,
someone else should have played the
future President of the United States.”
Hardin felt that many of Hollywood’s
male stars lacked virility. Mentioning
some golden-haired idols of recent years,
he said: “They won’t last, and some
of them haven’t lasted. But I guess they
appeal to something in women . . . the
mother instinct. Acting is no joke, I
tell you. It’s for men.
“An audience pays to see an actor
in danger. They like to see a male—
what do women contribute to a picture
after all? Love? Intrigue?” Some-
thing larger crashed on the carpet.
“Now this new series ‘Riptide.’ I’d
hate you to see what I’m earning on
it. The Fox lawyers nearly passed out
cold when they saw the contract. But
my Swiss company, Bronco Productions,
has a share in the profits. And this is
the first time a star of a TV series has
taken out a share and a low salary.
It’s a part that businessmen can identify
with, the man I play gets out of office
routines and settles for a life of adven-
ture in Australia.” And Ty Hardin,
fondling his whip, set out for his rugged
evening’s Adventures in Australia: Tony
Charlton waiting with crew and lights
on the second floor, Don Lane in the
offing, and a date with Sue Gallie for
dinner.
The children are at school all day, so
they don’t interrupt, but I am still
very emotionally involved in them
and this stops me concentrating on my
writing.
“When I was young, I wasn’t going
to get married. I was going to dedi-
cate myself to writing—be wholly com-
mitted. But I fell in love and got
married instead.”—SANDRA HALL.

BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Nowhere for a
refined person
to hang his hat
MELBOURNE MANSIONS has gone,
Cliveden Mansions is going, and now
this—Menzies Hotel is to come down
in 1969. BHP has decided to put up
a 35-storey tower on the site, a monu-
ment no doubt to the glory of their
$l7 shares. Dear reader, what’s left?
Where can the refined person hang his
hat?
Menzies was always the most signi-
ficant hotel in the Colonies. Archi-
bald Menzies opened it in 1853 and
BHP could have grabbed it from its
present site any time since 1867.
Actually we built the new Menzies
for the visit of our friend Prince Alfred,
Duke of Edinburgh, the centenary of
which we are celebrating right now.
Dammit, we had ' the whole place
illuminated with gas, the letters AEA
out front in honor of Alfred Ernest
Albert, flaming stars, and Professor
Freeland in his book “The Australian
Pub” reports that even the “Illustrated
Sydney News” grudgingly admitted it
was the finest hotel of its kind in
Australia.
It opened on November 11, 1867,
and on the previous Saturday more than
a thousand marched through for a look.
The “Argus” was terribly impressed.
It said it was “unique but by no means
outre,” with 80 bedrooms,, two large
billiard-rooms, eight private sitting-
rooms, a bathroom on every floor, and
an unheard-of display of rich panelling
and thick carpets.
It really was the thing. There was
always a band on Saturday nights,
and the well-to-do squatting families
always stayed there. They came en
suite, with at least one personal maid,
the children’s governess, and usually a
valet. A lady or a gentleman would
never have considered wearing anything
but evening dress for dinner.
But it was in 1896 that Menzies
came into its true glory, for then the
Menzies family spent £32,000 in add-
ing two floors . . . and that’s not all,
a lift went in, bathrooms in groups with
“enamel baths on claw feet with no
wood encasing them” (those damn baths
were still around nine years ago).
“There was a copious and instant supply
of hot water,” “electrical curling tongs
and an electric bell in every suite,” “a
winter garden with ferns,” and “pun-
kahs used with a most refreshing effect
during the warmer periods of the year.”
You may well ask how anyone was
able to produce all this grandeur dur-
ing the depths of the worst depression
ever. Well, you see, Melbourne’s tem-
perance land-booming wowsers, like Mr.
Jimmy Mirans and the Hon. Munro,
had decided to rid Melbourne of what
they called the “juggernaut of drink.”
So they put up a chain of magnificent
coffee palaces, the Victoria, the Federal
Coffee Palace, the Melbourne Coffee
Palace, and the Grand Coffee Palace
(now the Windsor).
Visitors to Melbourne failed to un-
derstand the pure enchantment of a
hotel that just served coffee, and all the
coffee palaces went broke. The annual
report of the Federal Coffee Palace of
1890, in announcing a loss, complained
that all their customers were going to
Menzies.
Now, for all irony collectors, here’s
a fascinating irony. The land-boomer
wowsers of the ’nineties failed utterly
to rid the city of drink. But the non-
wowser boomers of the ’sixties are do-
ing it magnificently. They have up-
rated the value of the land to such a
degree that it is becoming hard to get
a drink at this end of town. At
least 20 pubs have gone from the area
in the past ten years.
But let us continue with the refine-
ment of the place. Look who stayed
there. Apart from Alfred Ernest Albert,
there was George Augustus Sala, Proc-
tor the astronomer, Harry Furniss,
Melba, Boucicault, Anthony Trollope,
Mark Twain, Alexander Graham Bell,
Toti Dal Monte, Fritz Kreisler, Danny
Kaye, General MacArthur, Paderewski
Mark Twain, in order to pick up
some local color, asked if he could
stoke the boifers, Danny Kaye asked
“I never thought I’d weep over a
Menzies retiring!"
for a ping-pong table for his suite.
Trollope said he had never put up at
a better inn in any part of the world.
Paderewski said the food when he
visited in 1904 was indescribably bad
and he and Madame Paderewski had
to live almost entirely on pineapples.
Indeed on one occasion Paderewski
called over the waiter and said: “Tell
me, who is your chef? Is he a chef, or
a tailor, or a carpenter?” And the
waiter answered very seriously,
according to Paderewski—“Oh, no, sir,
he is an engineer.” After this Madame
P. went across to the markets every
morning with her concert manager and
they produced meals in their rooms.
It was always the place for wedding
receptions and the finest of bucks’
parties. The late Sir Rupert Clarke,
the second baronet, son cf Sir William,
had his bucks’ party there in 1887. It
is remembered that out of 100 cham-
pagne glasses only one remained un-
broken.
Menzies’ most famous party still goes
on. For many years it was run by the
grazier-yachtsmen brothers John and
Frank Livingston and since Frank’s
death John has given it alone. There
was a party as usual on the night
Red Handed had his win, but John
always does everything possible to make
sure there’s no publicity.
On these occasions Menzies is trans-
formed. One year they had the ban-
quet room looking like a scene from
Venice with water and all, another
year it was Arabian with a great tent,
and there have been Scottish themes,
yachting themes with big models of
Kurrewa V. The French champagne
flows non-stop all night.
So the old place is on the death list.
There have been no cries of pain from
the National Trust. The architect
was Joseph Reed, the man who de-
signed our Town Hall, the Exhibition
Building, the Trades Hall, Scots
Church, and, as Professor Freeland
says, it wasn’t his best effort. His in-
spiration came from 16th-century
French chateaus. Now the pub has
had so many additions it is on as many
levels as Luna Park. Yet the banisters
are eminently slidable and, unlike the
new reinforced concrete palaces, all
the floorboards squeak nicely under
foot.
There is one good room, the chan-
delier room with a $lO,OOO chandelier
and magnificent lonic columns, and
they still have the “Governor’s en-
trance” down the side. In the days of
the coffee palaces it was felt to be more
discreet if the Governor was not seen
entering a place that sold spirituous
liquor.
| We are told that the new BHP build-
ing will be all steel clad with a final
color of mellow rust, which is fright-
fully fashionable in New York right
now. If this is true, then it should
be most pleasing. It will fit in with a
fine old tradition. There’s more lovely,
old galvanised iron mellowed rust
around this town than you could shake
a stick at.

What's a second
kitchen without
a Persian rug?
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
“I BEG YOURS? Persian rugs dated,
old-fashioned?” Mr. Denis Croneen
stares fractionally down to a stack
of hand-knotted nomadic, village, and
urban carpets personally selected dur-
ing his last trip to Iran, never before
seen in Australia, and gives them a
stir with his shoe. Ah, yes, well that
word dated is the key to it all. People
will still think of Persian rugs with a
belonging-to-Grandmother image. Yes,
there you have it. And it is this fuddy-
dudSv image that Mr. Croneen, his wife,
Elysia, their newish public-relations man,
Canadian Richard Hurwitz, who says if
you don’t mind he prefers Sales Promo-
tion, PR is old hat, are trying to dispel.
Last year Mr. Croneen gave a
sherry party to a few invited customers.
This year he goes the whole hog with
two wine-and-cheese parties, which
Mrs. Croneen says always go rather
well; one for 200 taken from his secret
names lists that he guards with his life
—you’ve no idea the sinister things that
go on in Persian rugs, there was a
terrible scandal once in France which
ended up in court —not that he doesn’t
trust The Bulletin, of course; and the
other a Press party for art critics. Or,
as in this case, temporary Persian rug
writer for the week. Which revelation
saddens Mr. Hurwitz considerably.
The evening begins with a crisis.
Part of Mr. Croneen’s Pacific Highway
shop, transformed into a kind of casbah
with rug-lined alcoves and daybeds to
relax on, alas no hookah or belly-
dancing; Persian carpets aren’t as pop
as all that, part of it is filled with the
common Western sight of workmen
struggling to finish a job invisibly. The
professionals have mucked up the light-
ing and Mr. Granger, normally respect-
able in formal grey and a dignified
authority on oriental objets d’art, is saw-
ing away in cut-off jeans, and Mr.
Schneebeli, otherwise Ernest, sweeps
frantically with a carpet broom. Success.
Color transparencies of views from Mr.
Croneen’s Castle Cove home and one
of his Persian-rugged kitchen flash on
and Mr. Croneen says, that’s odd, the
second kitchen is missing.
Madame Christine Spindler, the
well-known city interior decorator,
arrives and brings a French air to what
is rapidly taking on the atmosphere
of a .Paddo art opening. She has, she
announces triumphantly, managed to
bring Madame Cornelius (of furs)
along. Madame Spindler adores Persian
rugs. Their bright colors are marvellous
with modern architecture. She cannot
wait to throw one down on her custom-
er’s silly old plain green Wilton to
show them the difference. Actually, she
used to own one herself, but, don’t
shout, she sold it to pay her fare to
England. For all she knows hers might
be under all these. The thing is, once
an addict always an addict. Isn’t that
right, Madame Cornelius? Madame
Cornelius says, seeing this is ruggy chat,
you mean once you’re hooked you’re
hooked. She, however, is not.
Along with wine and cheese, now
mixing violently with the smell of car-
pets, comes literature written by Mrs.
Croneen, who also does the advertising
copy. Mr. Hurwitz lets her, she knows
the rug language better than he. There
is “Could you Buy a Persian Carpet
Wisely?” and “A Guide to Oriental
Carpets.” The answer to the first is
yes, so long as it’s through Denis. His
rugs come with certificates of authen-
ticity, six months later he sends a. map
showing where it was woven. A little
touch, says Mrs. Croneen, that makes
them excited all over again. They
run a sort of lay-by scheme, too, a
status one of “I’ve got school fees this
month, can I leave you till next?” The
ten-page guide provides the layman with
everything he needs to know about his
new investment or status symbol or
work of art, depending which way he
looks at things. Knowing, for instance,
that a faded patch is meant to be, that
it’s caused by wool texture changing in
the dye, that it’s called Abrash, and
what a wonderful opening gambit it
would be to spin into someone’s house
and say, aha! you have two Abrashes
in your rug. Even more stimulating to
know the difference between a Dozar,
a Zaronim, and a Pushti: roughly two
feet smaller all round.
What is not included is the useful
information, delivered sotto voce by
Mr. Hurwitz, that businessmen buy rugs
as office furnishing, a tax-deductible
item. A good old Balouchistan, for in-
stance, for $9O up to $4OO for a very
interesting Bidjar or Farouk. After all,
he says, you’ve gotta have a carpet of
some kind, so it might as well be an
investment.
“We are planning,” says Denis
Croneen, “something ah something
very special for next February. It is
very, very secret —ah—an exhibition of
Persian rugs from—ah—from a very
famous collection (Rothschild, whispers
Mr. Hurwitz) —ah—it will amaze every-
one.”
Mr. Croneen sniffs. Excuses himself.
With tomorrow’s 200 guests milling
around and the weather so hot he says
right now —ah—he’d better do some-
thing about that—ah — cheese.


Shocking the British
back into their wits
COMMENT
BY
“OBSERVER”
]UST LOOK AT THIS year’s score.
The devaluation of our sterling assets
is merely another event to add to the
list. Before that, after giving assur-
ances that it would not pull out of
South-East Asia, Britain then announced
a timetable for its pull-out. In its
Common Market application Britain
has given up any pretence of concern-
ing itself with the interests of Com-
monwealth countries. Meanwhile the
Commonwealth itself has become so
explodable that it may never be game
enough to meet again. Japan is now
effectively replacing Britain as our main
customer and the United States is
coming into second place, leaving
Britain third. And an Australian is in
jail in Britain because his permit for
staying there has expired.
Apart from the constitutional link in
which we share a monarch with Britain
and some other countries, what other
kind of special relationship do we now
have with the British Government,
except the special relationship that,
whenever the British Government wants
to, it can dump us, while we are still
supposed to stick to them? There is,
of course, still the relationship between
our two peoples the relationship
that comes from a common history and
a common language. But we should
also remember that what we share with
Britain is not a prevailing Englishness
but a kind of overall Britishness or
Anglo-Saxonness that encompasses Irish
nationalism and Scottish nationalism,
Canadianism and Americanism as well
as the decaying approaches to life gen-
erated in the south-east corner of Little
England.
The present inhabitants of Britain
are not our Mother Country. They
are simply descendants, as we are, and
as the other English-speaking nations
are, of certain parts of a common his-
tory and common culture. We should
welcome them here as migrants, be-
cause we still share so many ways and
memories with them, just as we should
welcome other English-speaking peoples
as migrants. But, nation to nation,
government to government, what
special debt do we owe to them? What
do we owe Mr. Wilson, the Great
Illusionist, or the incompetent business-
men whose whimsical ineptitudes pro-
vide a continuing impulse toward
economic crisis? What do we owe the
manufacturers of “British public
opinion” who are now so excited about
“going into Europe” (and thereby, in
a sense, escaping their own country-
men) that they prefer to forget the
likes of us?
It is not our fault, but the fault of
bureaucrats, businessmen, politicians,
and general trend setters in London that
the British are in their present
economic plight and their fate, though
regrettable, is no special business of
ours. It is not our fault that the tone
of their society has not been modern-
ised, as happened in the Western Euro-
pean nations, so that they acquired
the vigor of lively economic communi-
ties. It is their business, not ours, if
they want to go on mooning about
the past, trooping their colors, pre-
tending they have a Commonwealth,
maintaining shabby pseudo-aristocratic
values, perpetuating snobberies and
hierarchies, acting as if history ended
with Dunkirk, or alternately luxuriat-
ing in those daydreams of pseudo-
change that go under the name of
“swinging Britain.” The real reason
why Britain is in an economic mess
is that its social climate is backward-
looking, not tuned to the age. Only
strong, tough shocks can knock the
rubbish out of British society. This is
why the Common Market entry might
be good because it might shock
them back into their wits.
Given our great lack of obligation
to them, the next time the British
Government wants to do something
that is against our interests our Gov-
ernment should get on to a tough
government-to-government basis, with
no more fooling around about special
relations. Our High Commissioner
should be put under the direct control
of the External Affairs Department to
emphasise the fact that the British
Government is just a government like
any other. Perhaps we should drop the
style of “High Commissioner” and in-
sist on calling the heads of our dip-
lomatic missions in Commonwealth
countries by the simple name of “Am-
bassador.” We should certainly recall
the present High Commissioner, who
seems more English than the English.
Australia has acted irresponsibly
in its relations with Britain. When
they have needed shocks we have
given them soft soap. When they have
needed honesty we have given them
sycophancy. It is time that we did
them the good turn of speaking about
the people who run Britain as we find
them.
Perhaps we should be pleased every
time an Australian is jailed in Britain
for overstaying his welcome. Such
treatment might force our young
people into countries where they can
learn something new about humanity
rather than try to pick up the rules of
a game that is lost.
Senators protesting too
much for anyone’s good
COMMENT
BY
ALAN
REID
AT VIRTUALLY EVERY meeting
during the Senate campaign, the Prime
Minister is being asked why he does not
join with Labor to press for the abo-
lition of the Senate. It is as though
voters are becoming increasingly con-
scious of the encroachment of the
Senate upon the authority of the
House of Representatives.
Such an attitude might be expected
of New South Wales, the most nation-
ally minded of the Australian States
and, as the largest one, less jealously
preoccupied with State rights than the
smaller States, which understandably
feel that the national Government at
Canberra can be too easily dominated
by the two giants, N.S.W. and Vic-
toria.
But these queries as to why Holt
does not move for the abolition of the
Senate are interestingly being put for-
ward in the smaller States as well.
They will not get anywhere, of
course. Labor’s platform provides for
the abolition of the Senate. But at
the moment the Senate is useful to
the Labor Party. With the Senate pro-
portional representation voting system,
Labor has been able to more 1 nearly
match the Government’s strength in
that chamber than it has in the
House of Representatives during the
past 18 years of Liberal-Country Party
rule.
The fact that Labor has used the
Senate as the parliamentary refuge for
quite a capable group of ALP Left-
wingers who, as individuals, might
have found it hard to win a House of
Representatives seat and the presence
of the two Democratic Labor Senators
Gair (Qld.) and McManus (Vic.)
who have also benefited from the
proportional representation voting
system have made the Senate more
respectable in Labor eyes than it has
been for years.
It will not be until the Senate again
becomes for Labor the eroding influence
that it now is for the Holt Govern-
ment that Labor will again remember
that its platform commits it to abolish-
ing the Senate.
In the interval, Labor is prepared
to use the chamber with what Holt
describes as “complete cynicism.”
Holt is obviously in difficulties when
he is answering these queries. He can
clearly see the damaging effect that a
hostile Senate has upon any govern-
ment. It makes a government fearful,


hesitant, and doubtful of its capacity
to implement its policy decisions. It
undermines a government’s self-confi-
dence and a danger is that when a
government loses confidence in itself
the voters also lose confidence.
Holt must have been tempted, when
queried at his meetings, to express
sympathy with the Labor Party’s
Senate abolition pledge. If he had done
so, he could have embarrassed Labor
in its drive for a Senate majority.
But he dealt with his questioners
honestly instead of opportunistically.,
He did not favor abolition of the
Senate. He and his Party supported the
bicameral system.
Not only that, but there was the
question of State representation. A
small State like Tasmania had ten
Senators and only five Members of the
House of Representatives. If the
Senate were abolished, Tasmania’s voice
would be proportionately much weaker
than it is in national affairs.
It would be grotesque to describe
the Senate as nothing but the States’
House safeguarding the rights of the
States. It functioned that way as far
as the Government parties were con-
cerned. Their Senators had and
exercised—the right to vote against
the Government on a matter of prin-
ciple. But the Labor Senator who
voted against the Caucus decisions
made by a body in which House of
Representatives Members were in a
majority would not last long. He
would be expelled.
Holt was bitter about the fact that
Opposition Leader Gough Whitlam,
who in speeches had suggested that
checks should be put upon the Senate’s
trespass upon the rights of the House
of Representatives, was a party to
using the Senate to thwart the will of
the House of Representatives.
Whitlam, he said, was a captive of
the ALP’s Left Wing and the more
aggressive Left-wing elements that were
seeking to use the Senate in this way.
Due to the evenness of Government
and Labor numbers in the Senate, the
Senate is currently enjoying a prom-
inence in national affairs that it has
not had for years. Its capacity to
thwart made it the more important
chamber during the last parliamentary
session. The danger is that it could
overreach itself in imposing its will
upon the House of Representatives.
As I see it, in a straightout clash
between the House of Representatives
and the Senate, it would be the Senate
that would probably lose out. Austra-
lian voters are unlikely to accept a situ-
ation in which an upper house dictates
to a lower chamber.
On the questions persistently being
asked of Holt about the desirability
of joining with Labor in seeking the
abolition of the Senate, it would seem
that some, at least, of Australian voters,
even in the smaller States, are wonder-
ing whether the Senate has not already
overreached itself in its drive for
superiority over the House of Repre-
sentatives.
Should we find an other
bank than Britain?
COMMENT
BY
MICHAEL
BAUME
THEY HAD TO DEVALUE in the
end; all their other efforts to get
Britain right again simply were not
working. But the Wilson devaluation
means more to us than the Cripps one
of 1949. It means that Britain is tak-
ing a further and major step farther
away from us: when Mr. Wilson said
at the weekend that he was putting
Britain first, he was simply reminding
us that we (and everyone else) come
second. We got no special considera-
tion; but that is nothing new in our
trade relations with Britain these days
(and why should we expect it, any-
way?).
For the basis of our trade relations
with Britain for many years has simply
been the self-interest of both parties.
We have sold things to Britain at
special rates and offered tariff conces-
sions to her because it suited us to
do so; she has done likewise. Now it
suits her to wipe her hands of us and
we have no right to complain about
it. And there is no doubt that this
devaluation, a preliminary requirement
for Common Market membership, is
a preliminary wipe-off to> Australia’s
special trading relations with Britain.
Of course we will complain about
a lot of things. There are plenty of
angry men in Canberra who feel duped
by the British on this devaluation; no
other government on earth has had
such faith (now proved to have been
misguided) in the currency of another
country to have had 60 percent of its
foreign reserves in that currency.
Britain’s devaluation knocks about $95
million off their value in trade with
countries that have not followed suit.
And since we only buy about 24 per-
cent of our imports from Britain, it
seems that our London funds will buy
about $5O million less for us than be-
for the devaluation.
There seems little doubt, however,
that the Government is angry about the
loss we did suffer.
For despite some solid nagging
(The Bulletin has had a few words to
say about it for a year or so), the
Government had decided to maintain
an unduly large amount of our reserves
in sterling, even though we are doing
less than 20 percent of our total trade
with Britain. True, the proportion that
these London funds and securities
make up of our reserves had been fall-
ing steadily in recent years (only four
years ago they had been 80 percent).
But this was due less to any policy
decisions than to the simple fact that
sterling has traditionally been the flex-
ible part of our reserves that moves
up and down, depending on how big
our reserves are.
Why, then, should we hold so much
in sterling when we trade so little in
it? It is all very well saying that we
had to hold our funds in London in
order to cover our large London debts,
which total £stg3o3 million on govern-
ment securities alone. It does seem
that, during the past few years, one
way the British may have encouraged
Australia to keep its funds in what
has turned out to be a losing propo-
sition was to say that any substantial
Australian switches out of sterling
would jeopardise the Australian Gov-
ernment’s chances of getting British ap-
proval to raise more loans in Britain.
So what? Well, it just happens that
coincidentally the huge sum of $l4O
million in Australian Commonwealth
loans raised in Britain in past years is
coming up for maturity in the next
year or so; with other foreign markets
in their present condition it would be
difficult, indeed, to raise this sort of
money elsewhere overseas, so a full
redemption would mean another jolt
to Australia’s foreign reserves.
But there is a good case for claim-
ing that this would not have mattered
anyway; that if we had pulled out of
sterling (leaving only the 20 percent or
so we need to cover our immediate
trading requirements) and switched the
bulk of our reserves into dollars we
would have been given special con-
sideration by the United States in its
tough restrictions on foreign invest-
ment. After all, the Japanese and the
Canadians have been given a partial
exemption from the savage taxes on
foreign investment from the U.S. that
has dried up the flood of cash com-
ing to places like Australia. It would
have been a pretty fair exchange to
have got something like this.
It is too late now to worry about
this sort of thing, although no doubt
the Opposition will have a go at the
Treasurer’s refusal to damage sterling
by removing Australia’s reserves from
Britain only to see sterling damage
itself.
What now? British bank rate is now
so high, at 8 percent, that it would
only take a couple of years of London
interest rates to more than offset in
interest the capital loss we have suf-
fered. But don’t let us imagine that
sterling is now safe and sound and
that there is no risk of a further devalu-
ation in time. For 14.3 percent is not
very large at all; it will not succeed
in getting Britain out of its mess on its
own the other savage measures all
have to work. So now that Britain
is clearly trimming her sails to the
Common Market winds, it is time for
us to get off the sterling ship. Besides,
it still might sink.


AUSTRALIA
The Treasury ran hot
with a cool line
ON SATURDAY at 2.30 p.m., while he
was looking through his notes for the
election campaign in his motel room in
Dubbo, Mr. McMahon received a
phone call from the secretary of the
PM’s Department, Sir John Bunting,
telling him that the British had finally
taken the plunge. He spent the rest
of his afternoon talking it out by
phone with senior departmental men
and the Prime Minister. They decided
that the two top men of the Treasury,
Sir Richard Randall and Mr. Morris
O’Donnell, would fly to Sydney on
Sunday morning (when the news
would become public) to join Dr.
Coombs and Mr. Phillips of the Reserve
Bank to confer with the Treasurer.
They all agreed that the economic
case for staying put was overwhelming.
Treasury officials had often had a
think about it. As a rather feeble
hedge they had begun to allow Austra-
lian sterling balances to take the full
burden of the recent fall in overseas
reserves, gradually accumulating dol-
lars,. gold, and IMF rights instead of
sterling. _
Ihey had developed a general view
that Australia should not follow Britain
in the case of a devaluation. And Mr.
McMahon had quite eloquently ex-
pounded this view to those who asked
{ ■
him.
To make his thinking public the
Treasurer issued a statement on Sun-
day night, pointing out that Australia’s
membership of the International Mone-
tary Fund required that it prove to the
board of that organisation that pay-
ments were in fundamental disequilib-
rium before devaluation could be justi-
fied. Officials in the Treasury were
reasonably optimistic about the
medium-term future of Australia’s bal-
ance of payments and confident that
earnings from mineral exports would,
from 1970 onwards, be large enough to
more than offset any adverse trends in
rural produce. But they did agree that
if they had to make out a case they
could say that there was a falling trend
in wool, sugar, and wheat prices in the
past six or eight months. They admitted
that they would find it hard to demon-
strate that the British devaluation in
itself necessitated an Australian de-
valuation. The IMF application is not
the mere formality it is sometimes re-
garded as. Contravention of IMF rul-
ings may be followed by denial of the
use of IMF drawing rights, which in
present circumstances add up to s7oom.
All Sunday a pair of Treasury
assistant-secretaries worked in the mas-
sive new Treasury building taking out
figures for the “technical paper” for
Cabinet. Three hundred yards away to
the east, in the old grey administration
building, following the “McEwen
Line » a host of Trade Department men
labored
to compile a case for devalua-
tion.
? eo V[ e in * e Treasury were quite
co ° about the issue. They agreed
readily that Australian dairy and sugar
farmers and dried fruits men would
be at a severe disadvantage unless Aus-
tralia were to devalue with Britain. But
“The end of any remaining special relationship”
they pointed out that these industries
are the very ones which will have to
contract anyway when Britain joins
the Common Market. “British devalu-
ation could be a sort of first-stage Com-
mon Market entry,” was the way one
official summed it up. The Govern-
ment could buy Australian farmers
another 18 months or two years respite
for the price of devaluation. But the
price would be very high and the
benefit illusory and shortlived.
They worked out the price of Aus-
tralian devaluation in rough terms as
s3oom. a year, or 14 percent of the
value of non-British imports. With huge
orders in for American defence equip-
ment and the Japanese bound to grow
in importance as suppliers of machinery
and engineering equipment, the cost of
devaluation would grow.
The Treasury officials insisted that
something had to be done for the
affected farmers but they asked why
the whole economy had to be turned
upside down to help them. “It’s like
the way at the Arbitration Commis-
sion,” said one official. “There is an
attempt to justify an across-the-board
rise in pay on the basis of the fact that
a few thousand people at the bottom
deserve to do better. We need to adopt
a more selective approach in these
matters.”
With the economy of Australia
booming, it was the Treasury line that
devaluation would be a dangerous addi-
tion to cost pressures and would cause
a considerable acceleration in inflation.
To satisfy Mr. McEwen, they urged
that a purposeful start should be made
now on reconditioning the sugar,
dairying, and the fruit industries for
the harder times of a European Britain.
Mr. Holt had got the word at lunch-
time on Saturday at his seaside house
at Portsea. The British Prime Minister
had cabled all Embassies and High
Commissioners early Saturday. Mr.
Holt’s message reached him via the
British High Commission in Canberra
and the Prime Minister’s Department.
People around Mr. Holt said that it

was one of his most severe political
tests. It was symbolic of all the prob-
lems he had to cope with, not least his
relations with the Country Party. He
had to be conciliatory yet decisive.
And he had the Senate election on his
tail. He had to satisfy the very real and
legitimate fears of the farmers, while
satisfying the electorate that he was
doing the right thing by the country.
The devaluation was a dramatic
break in the election campaign. People
around the Prime Minister saw it as
an opportunity to project him in action
as the leader who could face the chal-
lenge of big decisions. At the very
least, it took the spotlight off the mis-
handled VIP controversy and the cam-
paign’s general lack of lustre. But
others were worried that the Govern-
ment might delay in making a decision,
in which it would compare badly with
most other governments throughout
the world.
The Government’s quickness to react
demonstrated that the two coalition
parties could agree on economic affairs.
While the Government’s economic
advisers and the main elements of the
Liberal Party saw no reason to follow
on the skirt-tails of Britain, the strong
pressures from the Country Party, while
not holding up decision, will see to it
that farmers get some other form of
help.
There is one thing on which every-
one in Canberra seemed to agree. The
sterling devaluation is quite certain to
mean the end of any remaining special
relationship between Australia and
Britain. Although they often speculated
about the devaluation of sterling, Aus-
tralian Ministers tended to accept the
categorical assurances they had got in
private as well as in public, that sterl-
ing would be maintained. But, as in
their statements about maintaining a
military presence East of Suez, repeated
assurances have proved to mean noth-
ing. Deep doubts must now be held
about the personal integrity of mem-
bers of the Wilson Government, doubts
which probably rule out the possibility
of sustained co-operation in a number
of fields.
Defence and External Affairs officials
think there is even less chance than
before of meaningful co-operation in
defence of the Malaysia-Singapore
region, and that Britain can no longer
be considered an active member of
SEATO. The British elements of the
Commonwealth Strategic Reserve
stationed in Malaysia will now be with-
drawn during the course of 1968. The
possibility of any substantial British
naval or air presence in the Indian
Ocean is seriously reduced by the fur-
ther cuts in British defence spending
overseas (s2som) which accompany the
devaluation and credit squeeze.
But its an ill wind ... if the Depart-
ment of Primary Industry is unhappy,
at least the Immigration Department
next door is certain to gain more busi-
ness as applications by Britons to emi-
grate are boosted by Mr. Wilson’s more
intense austerity measures.
THE
Holt: chasing the Artful Dodger
from ALAN REID, touring with Mr. Holt
HAROLD HOLT STARTED the cur-
rent Senate election campaign clearly
convinced that he would be fighting on
the Vietnam issue, undoubtedly the
largest and most important issue in
Australia’s national life. But he also
wanted balance. He did not want to be
accused of side-stepping basic domestic
issues. Rightly or wrongly, he has pride
in what he views as the achievements
of his own and the Menzies administra-
tion over the past 18 years. He wanted
these achievements debated.
After the first week of campaigning
he was exasperated. Events, the tactics
of the Opposition Leader, Mr. Whit-
lam, and his own temperament resulted
in the public debate being conducted
on matters such as the VIP affair and
the Voyager inquiry, which Holt con-
sidered as only incidental to the life of
the nation.
Whitlam, whom, as the campaign
progressed, Holt began to regard as
“the Artful Dodger,” simply evaded the
Vietnam issue by his ambiguity on
where he stood in relation to his own
Party’s policy of withdrawing Australian
troops unless the United States accepted
ALP-imposed conditions.
Holt tried to get the debate going
on the major domestic matters —
employment (his boast is that during
its 18 years of office the Liberal
administration has maintained a full
employment program unmatched by
any industrialised country in the world
operating within the framework of a
free economy), housing (75 percent of
Australians are homeowners and 46 out
of every 100 houses in Australia were
built during the years of a Liberal
Government), the general state of the
economy and living standards (for
which, claims Holt, a useful guide is
the fact that Australia for cars per
head of population now ranks second
in the world only to the United States),
and even national development and
social services, the aspects on which
Labor claims the Government to be
most vulnerable.
But Whitlam managed to keep on
changing the subject.
Sir Robert Menzies would probably
have brushed aside his assailant’s tactics
as unimportant against the broad pic-
ture of a prosperous, developing nation
protected by its close ties with the
United States and maintaining stability
and progress despite events such as
droughts and fluctuations in the price
of products marketed overseas which a
generation ago would have reduced
Australia’s living standards.
But Holt is a victim of his own tem-
perament. He has what for some of
his colleagues is an alarming frankness.
He feels that the public is entitled to
explanations and he feels under a com-
pulsion to explain. The more he ex-
plained last week the more he shifted
on to Whitlam’s ground.
Some of Holt’s bitterness over the
way the campaign has been fought on
what he considers the lesser rather
than the greater issues emerged when
in Launceston he accused Whitlam of
lying for political purposes. He is much
more tense than he was at the last
general elections. He has unusually
clashed several times with Pressmen
during this campaign, obviously feel-
ing that they, like Whitlam, are more
concerned with what he views as the
lesser issues.
The impression is of a lonely man.
While Whitlam is surrounded by
advisers, Holt seems to be working
almost alone, doing his own thinking
and making his own decisions on what
should be his tactics. But one thing
can be relied upon. Whatever the out-
come of the present Senate campaign
electorally the personal relationships
between Holt and Whitlam are never
again going to be the same. Holt
undoubtedly is convinced he made one
of the most accurate political diagnoses
of his career when he described Whit-
lam as “the Artful Dodger.”


Whitlam's biggest weapon, civility
from BOB BAUDINO, touring with Mr. Whitlam
IN THE WHITLAM CAMP they see
their man clearly ahead on points and
still setting the pace. Bouncing from
State to State, hall to hall, hour to
hour, he has shown some fancy foot-
work; he got in the first punch and
since then he has changed style so
rapidly that his opponent is continually
looking for counters. Even his oppo-
nent’s seconds are collecting a few on
the side. Holt’s best effort, a wild back-
hander at Launceston designed to brand
Whitlam a liar, was pushed aside with
a laugh.
Fastidious by nature, as a cam-
paigner Whitlam spares no pains in
both dress and work. He wears what
special suit the scene demands—shirt-
sleeves in Brisbane, but an immacu-
lately pressed dark suit for television.
And he speaks and gestures to suit an
audience. Television, radio, lunch-hour
meetings, and evening meetings all de-
mand special emphases and gestures
and he rehearses them carefully before-
hand. But his biggest weapon on this
campaign is his civility. Everyone, in-
cluding interjectors, and there are
precious few of them, may have his
undivided attention.
In Sydney he discussed differences
with a group of young Liberals; in
Melbourne, police were worried about
the large crowd which pressed around
him after the end of his talk at St.
Hilda Town Hall; in Adelaide, he stood
in the middle of the road outside the
Glenelg Town Hall discussing points
with a young political enthusiast who
did not look old enough to vote; in
Hobart, he was kissed by a middle-aged
supporter who then introduced him to
all her friends.
St. Hilda Town Hall in Melbourne
showed the differences in performance
and reactions to speeches between Whit-
lam and his predecessor, Arthur Cal-
well. Calwell opened his campaign
his last as Labor leader at St.
Hilda in November last year to a
packed, noisy crowd. He had all the
traditional trappings, standing ovations,
feet stomping, clapping, three cheers,
“for he is a jolly good fellow,” a bar-
rage of interjections. Whitlam was
politely clapped, cheered once, had
no interjectors. But he was listened to,
and listened to attentively and critic-
ally. The impression gained was that
many of the 800 present wanted to see
for themselves what the new Labor
image looked like. There was also an
impression of quiet pride in the aura
of strength the very bulk of Whitlam
conveys. And at this meeting, and all
others, there were many more young
people.
Whitlam’s tactics, guided to some
extent by Press Secretary Graham
Freudenberg, have been extremely
nimble. Under fire at an impromptu
Press conference on the tarmac at
Adelaide airport about why he would
not re-state Labor’s Vietnam policy,
particularly the “blackmail” clause
threatening withdrawal of Australian
troops, Whitlam got himself a short
but under the circumstances extremely
valuable respite by saying “What a
bloody awful place to hold a Press
conference.” This gave him a. chance
to march away from the wailing jets
to the VIP room and to have a heads-
together talk with his personal staff
before taking the conference. Whitlam
left Adelaide airport knowing full well
what the headlines were going to be
next day unless he did something. He
did something. He tried to kick away
the Vietnam issue by dropping the St.
John Voyager document allegation an
hour later at the Stow Town Hall.
And then at Glenelg Town Hall
that evening he declared that if there
was a House of Representatives elec-
tion before the 1969 Federal Confer-
ence of the Labor Party the Vietnam
policy “would apply.” “They (the
terms of the policy) would appear in
my policy speech,” he said. Again
not much publicity. The St. John
allegation commanded the space and
Whitlam had said what he had been
studiously avoiding saying all the week
with as little publicity as he could
manage.
Mining
Great Boulder's comeback
WREN AND THEODORE. These
are names to conjure with: names of
men who battled their way up from
humble beginnings and who more than
made good, leaving an indelible mark
on Australian business and politics.
And they are names with a future, if
the nickel boom fulfils its present
promise.
For the Phoenix-like nickel-lead
resurrection of Great Boulder Gold
Mines, the last of the original miners
on Kalgoorlie’s Golden Mile, is notable
not only for the astounding rise in its
share price from 40 cents earlier this
year to as high as $14.50, nor for the
way some knowledgeable investors
seemed to know more about the com-
pany’s high nickel grades than directors
did when announcing only 3.9 percent
nickel (amended the following morning
to a much more exciting 10.9 percent)
a couple of months ago. Equally fas-
cinating is the way Great Boulder’s
rebirth has brought back to the centre
of the Australian mining scene the re-
doubtable names of Wren, Theodore,
and Cody. It is as if the clock had been
turned back to the 19305, to an earlier
generation of mining men.
But it is a new generation; the dir-
ectors of Great Boulder (and of its
largest shareholder, Loloma Mining
Corporation) are no longer the John
Wren, Ted Theodore, and Pat Cody
of 20 and 30 years ago, all of whom
are long since dead. The Cody who is
E. G. Theodore in the ’30s
now its chairman is N.J.; the John
Wren on the board is the old man’s
son, just as E. G. Theodore’s place has
been taken by his son, N.B. This group
came into the box seats in Great
Boulder through their control of
Loloma, the former Fiji gold-mining
company that ended up with 800,000
shares in Great Boulder as its directors
preferi'ed to invest a large proportion
of its profits rather than distribute them

all as taxable income. And two other
Wren companies, Emperor Mines and
King Island Scheelite (in which other
mining names like Wallace Smith and
Nilsen appear), also hold a decent
swag of Great Boulder shares.
Before its Wren-Theodore period,
Great Boulder had been through the
mill of the legendary Claude de Ber-
nales, who used it to add substance to
his campaign to raise staggering sums
of money from British investors on
worthless mining ventures. For Great
Boulder has been the richest mine in
Kalgoorlie’s history; gold worth more
than $250 million has been won during
its 73-year life and the only losses it
has ever suffered have been in the
past two years. Bernales’ ten years in
John Wren.. . richest man
control ended with the war and in
1948 the company changed its domicile
from London to Australia, with two
Australians, E. G. Theodore and J. V.
Ratcliffe, joining the board. Theodore
had founded Loloma, which acquired
23 percent of Great Boulder’s capital.
Wren, the legendary millionaire
financier who wielded such great politi-
cal power, died 14 years ago aged 83.
From running an illegal tote in Col-
lingwood at 18, he battled his way up
to becoming Australia’s richest man,
owning (or having a large stake in)
racecourses, stadiums, trotting tracks,
hotels, distilleries, goldmines, news-
papers, and masses of real estate. Pat
Cody was the “C” in the CWL Pty.
Ltd. partnership (Cody, Wren, Lean)
that was a major vehicle for Wren’s
investments and in which he had a
$500,000 stake on his death.
Wren was the major shareholder in
the Fiji goldmines found and developed'
by E. G. Theodore, Federal Treasurer
during the Depression, before that
Queensland’s Premier from 1919 to
1925, and Director-General of the
Allied Works Council during the 19.39-
45 war. Apart from their striking
difference in stature, Theodore big but
cultured; Wren a small, wiry, teetotal
non-smoker), they had many similari-
ties. Both ended up with large news-
paper interests, Wren owning half “The
Courier-Mail” and Theodore being
chairman of Consolidated Press.
Both were involved in bitter disputes
that ended in court: Wren in an action
brought by his wife against Frank
Hardy, author of the thinly veiled
biography of Wren, “Power Without
Glory” (which he lost), and Theodore
as the successful defendant in an action
brought by the Queensland Govern-
ment arising out of the Mungana affair
(in which it claimed he and others had
sold it the Mungana mines for four
times their real value).
Both men had a tough early life;
Theodore, son of a Rumanian father
and Irish mother, had to leave school
and his Adelaide home at 12 and work
in W.A. before going to northern
Queensland’s mining boom, becoming
a- union organiser and then a Labor
member of the Queensland Parliament
at 24, Theodore, who died at 65, three
years before Wren, had been defeated
as Federal Treasurer in 1931 following
his controversial proposals to create
credit to give immediate work to the
unemployed—and also after the Mun-
gana affair, in which he was severely
criticised by a Royal Commissioner but
exonerated in the subsequent trial. Buf
his departure from politics gave him
time for business; he helped start Con-
solidated Press and was chairman for
13 years from 1936.
Theodore’s experience as a teenage
goldminer in the W.A. goldrush of
the 90’s was useful in his finding and
exploiting the huge Fiji gold deposits
in which John Wren became his
partner. In 1933 he had read a news-
paper report of gold discoveries in
Fiji and went there to have a look,
spent $80,009 prospecting and within
a year had found three rich mines.
But Loloma’s gold-mining days are
over, and Great Boulder’s gold opera-
tions are now in serious decline; not
even the Commonwealth’s gold-mining
subsidy can meet the growing gap
between rising production costs and the
fixed price of gold.
But if Great Boulder’s nickel comes
good, the new generation that succeeded
their remarkable fathers may have
achieved something really significant
out of what had begun to look like a
pretty sick investment; already the
market’s valuation of their company
has jumped from $1.4 million to $42
million, with experts predicting more
rises to come. The “boys” are main-
taining an impressive tradition.

Victorian unions
Wrong ticket
SOME WEEKS AGO the Melbourne
Trades Hall Council, finding itself
rapidly going broke, decided to in-
crease the affiliation fees of its mem-
ber unions. About 30 of them in the
control of Left-wing officials immedi-
ately let it be known they would not
pay the increased fees. Last week the
THC executive suspended 26 of them
and precipitated a Left-Moderates
split which, if not papered over soon,
could spread to a final break.
The rebel unions are currently be-
ing led by Mr. Ted Innes of the Elec-
trical Trades Union and the Victorian
Mick Jordan... 26 rebels
ALP central executive, in the absence
of Mr. Laurie Carmichael, Communist
secretary of the Amalgamated Engineer-
ing Union, now in Moscow for the
anniversary of the Revolution. Last
week Innes explained that the rebel
unions paid more than half the run-
ning costs of the Trades Hall Council
and represented more than 60 percent
of the affiliated membership, “but
we have a minority voice on the Coun-
cil and no voice on the executive, which
is the top administrative body.”
Then Innes and his assistant spokes-
men, Messrs. Hogan and Carr (all three
are ALP members), mentioned the “in”
word of the moment in Trades Hall
circles and along the bars of the Lygon
Hotel opposite, where most of the
leaders of the Victorian union move-
ment plot and play the dues were
not being withheld on such a simple
matter as money but as a matter of
“principle.” It was a matter of prin-
ciple that made the rebel unions feel
they should have more members on
the Council and its executive.
Their proposal was that they would
pay up if the rules for the sending of
delegates to the Council were changed
so that the large Communist-led and
Left-wing unions could gain an addit-
ional delegate for each additional 1500
union members beyond an original
1000. At present the maximum number
of delegates for any one union is four.
The Carmichael-Innes formula would
give the “rebel” unions an extra 100
delegates and the “loyal” unions an
extra 61, and the difference would be
sufficient to wrest control of the Coun-
cil from THC secretary Mick Jordan
and his moderate supporters. The
“principle” of the Left, then, is that
they should have power.
And their current attempt to gain
it involves what would be, in effect,
the largest and most obvious Unity-
ticket set-up in many years. The rebel
union leadership consists of Peking-
line, Moscow-line, and Italian-line
Communists, fellow travellers of each
group, and ALP members including
leaders of Victorian Labor’s central
executive. The 26 suspended unions
are representative of the leaders of all
important Communist factions in Aus-
tralia and of the inner group which
runs the Victorian Labor Party.
Their unity is apparent in such
statements by Innes, Carr, and Hogan
(all members of the ALP) as: “We
have a minority voice on the Council
and no voice on the executive . . .
we are prepared to consider any pro-
posal which would resolve the present
situation ... we do not aim to set up
another trade union centre . . .” The
“we” refers to the alliance of Com-
munists and ALP leaders.
THC secretary Mick Jordan, who
has held meetings with the “rebel”
leaders, describes “matters of prin-
ciple” which they have indicated they
want to discuss at any further get-
together:
1. Representation of unions to the
Trades Hall Council.
2. To discuss all aspects of THC fin-
ance and in particular the recent
increase in affiliation fees.
3. To alter the present structure of
the executive.
4. To discuss the rights of unions in
industrial disputes and other mat-
ters.
5. To discuss and where necessary alter
or amend any of the rules of the
Trades Hall Council.
With such clear implications of what
the Left is demanding, Jordan has
turned the whole affair over to the
ACTU. But if Mr. Whitlam should
decide after the Senate election that
he cannot win in 1969 without taking
drastic action against the leadership of
the Victorian ALP, the opportunity to
do so is there.


THE NEW BOYS
IN THE DAYS of Menzies and Calwell,
there they were, the two old-timers,
fighting away on a front that had been
-established before World War I,
■enacting roles that, even if the words
changed from time to time, were,
nevertheless, as predictable as a tradi-
tional performance in mime. Each of
the two players was gesture-perfect in
his part, and even though the act was
little related to anything that still
mattered there was a charm in its pre-
dictability, as there is in the assuredness
of a Punch and Judy show.
Novelty came with the young fellow
Harold Holt, not quite 60 but able to
take the old contender on with both
arms folded. In last year’s election cam-
paign, when Calwell fought away on the
conscription battles of 50 years ago, all
young Holt had to do was to be there,
to demonstrate Calwell’s irrelevance. He
was the symbol of the young man who
smiles to himself when his old dad
still can’t get off the subject of what
he did in World War I.
Now it’s all gone. We shall never see
the old-timers again. A mere 50-year-
old, Whitlam now robs Holt of his
■exclusive image of immediate and
obvious relevance. There is a new per-
formance to be played between two
men of something approaching the con-
temporary image. To what extent have
these young chaps yet learned how to
play their parts? This year they have
been taking each other’s measure.
Neither of them had anything very
new to say, but Holt could not act as if
Whitlam were Calwell, and Whitlam
could not act as if Holt were Menzies.
Has either of them yet learned to act
as if the other were really the other?
The present Senate election campaign
is their first major try-out and it seems
to suggest something that was also
obvious in the past couple of months of
parliamentary manoeuvring: that Whit-
lam seems to have moved more quickly
into a new role than Holt.
On superficial form Holt seemed
ahead. He was what many Australians
like to think they like a man to be: an
'earnest hardworker in the office, but a
man who knows how to relax when
work is over, as he speared away at
fish and got on well with his relatives
at his high-class weekender. Serious
about his vocation, but a simple out-
doorsman as well. Ah open smile. An
outstretched hand. A man of candor.
Compared with Holt, Whitlam
seemed a bit of a swot. He was a com-
plete indoorsman. He showed no
interest in anything except his job
and therefore by the standards of some
Australians he was only half a man.
And not only was there something
wrong with the chap whose job seemed
to be his whole life, but there was a
stiffness in his manner: just the faintest
hesitancy in style, as if he were calcu-
lating what act to put on next. A kind
of acting-out of what he was saying.
Too much concern with effect. Is
Gough sincere? they were asking, the
most idiotic question that can be asked
of any politician.
Yet there is no general rule on what
“image” sells best in a politician. Even
some of those who in theii own lives
had mastered the manners of an easy
informality ciiticised Holt. They
seemed to be looking for some sense of
substance in a Pnme Minister, some of
that Roman senator s gravitas at which
Menzies at times was master: and Whit-
lam s appaient bookishness and slight
inclination to prissiness showed some
appeal even to those who despised such
things in theii own lives.
Take one simple example the
ritualistic windbagging occasions when
politicians have to get up and say
something nice and then sit down again.
Once these did not matter. But now,
when the TV cameras are trained on
them, they can provide the elector with
the kind of experience that may change
his idea of a party’s image. It now
has a political effect when the Prime
Minister puts on a performance at_a
parliamentary luncheon to welcome
the Italian President or the Japanese
Prime Minister, for instance. He is
watched not just by a few bored MPs
but by hundreds of thousands of his
fellow countrymen that evening.-
Whitlam has seized on the political
advantage of these occasions much more
quickly and effectively than Holt. He
has seen ] n th e procession of foreign
leaders who have recently visited Aus-
tralia a chance to put himself across.
For one thing he seems to have estab-
lished his right to speak on all such
occasions immediately after the Prime
Minister a privilege granted to few
opposition leaders in other countries.
And whenever he does this, he speaks
well. His speeches are obviously imag-
inatively researched and he delivers
them with a certain freshness that com-
pels attention. He seems to be grappling,
for example, with the necessity of de-
livering the simple concrete metaphor,
For example: “History has made us
for over a century one of Britain’s out-


This article is not concerned with the issues in the Senate election which, to The
Bulletin, seem plainly enough to revolve around Australia's involvement in Viet-
nam and its relations with its American ally, but with the more subtle business
of "image-building," unimportant in itself, but sometimes politically decisive.
lying farms. We should not in this
century permit geography or geology
to leave us merely an offshore quarry
of Japan.” He is also acquiring the
ability of making Australia sound an
interesting place to live in with its own
sense of responsibility toward the
world. For example: “Japan has unique
experience in raising the living stan-
dards of dense and immense Asian
populations. We in Australia have
unique experience in developing and
fructifying tropical areas . . . Together
by virtue of our combined experience
and wealth we could play a decisive
role in helping the developing countries
In our region to help themselves.”
On these occasions Whitlam looks
as if he has been doing some thinking
lately. He can appeal both to conscience
and to intelligence and he manages it
with a certain appearance of dignity.
Holt without necessarily meaning
to seems the embarrassed, amiable
uncle who has been unexpectedly called
on to say a few words. It is as if the
words themselves are of no .importance.
For this role you must just sling a
few old words together. It is the getting
up, the opening and closing of the
mouth, and the sititng down that
matters. He almost always appears
banal.
This contrast does not mean that
Holt wishes to set thoughtlessness up
against intelligence. It means more
that he hasn’t "worked out how to make
good speeches. It reflects a different
sense of priority. For a speech of this
sort Whitlam starts work two or three
weeks beforehand because he wants
several drafts, which he .'olishes up.
Holt sometimes does not have a draft
at all. Even when he does go in for
speech preparation it is hurried and un-
imaginative,
The contrast in public style also re-
fleets the very different kinds of staff
the two men use, and their attitude to
the functions of staff. Whitlam thinks
politically. Holt thinks administratively,
I n his office Whitlam has three men
with a good measure of political zeal
and experience. In political terms they
are young. They are close students of
the Kennedys and Wilsons and the
Lee Kuan Yews. And Whitlam draws
on help from fellow parliamentarians.
His advisers must do a better political
job than the cautious, career-minded
public servants who make up Holt’s
personal staff. If Holt often sounds like
a cautious official, it is because he is
surrounded by men who are cautious
officials.
Like many other members of his
ministry, Holt has been in government
for so long that he has lost day-to-day
contact with backroom political advisers.
These people are still on the party
payroll, but, like some sort of ornament,
they are housed away from serious
affairs in a little Georgian building (a
monument to the architectural whims of
Sir Robert Menzies), where they are
visited only by lowly backbenchers.
With some notable exceptions, Min-
isters deal only with Government
officials, who are naturally reluctant to
give political advice and in any case
are bad at it. Their habit is to concen-
trate on maintaining liaison between
their boss and the department, and this
absorbs most of their time. In helping
a Minister to talk to his fellow country-
men, they are rank amateurs. Nor do
most of them want the job.
Holt has shown awareness of his pre-
dicament. He hired an ex-editor of the
“Age” to help him out. But he housed
him in with the rest of the Prime
Minister’s Department in an office
block away from Parliament House and
seems to have put .him mainly on to
cultural affairs. In any case he was
not necessarily equipped to give politi-
cal advice, or expected to.
This bureaucratisation of the Prime
Minister not only explains why he
usually speaks so badly, it also explains
some of his other major failings as a
politician. For instance, with better
political advice, he would not have
made hfs most serious political mistake
in the past six months his failure to
see what it meant to him that he did
not control the Senate. More than any-
thing else, the dismal VIP affair can be
attributed to this weird blindness about
the significance of the Senate. If the
Prime Minister and his personal staff
had sat down and thought their way
through the power of an uncontrolled
Senate they would have recognised that
the Senate was in a position to pass a
motion calling the Departmental Head
to answer questions. They would then
not have embarked on the attempted
cover-up of records. And if they had
thought about the Senate more they
would not have got themselves into
trouble over postal charges by prema-
turely introducing legislation before the
Budget.
This blindness toward the Senate was
part of a larger blindness. For all his
ability as a committeeman, and his
intuitive faith in the good sense of Aus-


tralians when confronted with his cour-
ageous measures on Vietnam and other
issues, Holt strongly remains a novice
in detecting which political issues are
likely to blow up next. And when there
is a political explosion even if it is
on a comparatively trivial matter he
doesn’t seem able to step in and put
the fire out at once.
When the Voyager affair came up he
misjudged the capacity of his own
backbenchers to kick up a fuss. And
in his repeated mis judgment of the
capacity of the DLP, the ALP, and the
Independents to sustain the VIP affair
he seemed to believe that each time he
rose to speak he would be speaking for
the last time. But each speech he made,
instead of closing the issue, opened
up some new bit of it. His answers
raised new questions.
To say all of this is not to suggest
that Whitlam does not show political
ineptitudes. He was made to look very
foolish when he ducked a debate on
the commitment of extra troops to
Vietnam (and had to debate the matter
later anyway). And his heavily facted
speeches continue to contain the occa-
sional unfortunate un-fact. His other-
wise devastating speech on the day
Parliament debated Mr. Howson’s offer
of resignation contained a silly mistake
about which books contained what pas-
senger list, and, in an earlier debate, the
Treasurer was able to clean up be-
cause of mistakes in fact. Where Whit-
lam moves ahead of Holt is in his
awareness of TV and general publicity
as sometimes mattering more than
what goes on in Parliament.
Indeed, in Parliament Holt sometimes
scores where Whitlam fails. He is able
to make small political points off the
cuff, and engage in political repartee
better than most. Sometimes he can
rally his supporters behind him in Par-
liament with a fiery speech so that there
is almost a continuous roar of mur-
mured approval and urgings. On one
occasion, during the VIP debate, the
excitement during a Holt perform-
ance came to resemble that at a box-
ing match, and one of his backbenchers
was right with it, shouting repeatedly
“Let him have it, Harold” and “Into
’im.”
Not as popular with his colleagues
as Holt, Whitlam cannot mobilise this
sort of earthy enthusiasm. But his relent-
less lawyer’s pointrscoring earns respect,
if not affection. He has the good poli-
tician’s ability to seize on a simple issue
and bang it hard, whereas at times
Holt seems to have forgotten what the
issue is. Holt sometimes sniffs nervously
around crucial issues in a debate: his
lecture on the vital importance of the
Commonwealth Parliamentary Associa-
tion on the occasion of the Howson
resignation offer is the most recent and
'.most lamentable example.
In the handling of internal Dafty
tensions, both Holt and Whitlam have
problems. Whitlam’s problems matter
to Australia. Most of Holt’s matter
mainly to his party.
Whitlam’s vigorous championing of
the cause of the Right-wingers at the
June conference of his party was not
successful. As he fiercely denounced the
extremist Left faction, epitomised by
the leadership of the Victorian Branch,
it looked—for the umpteenth time this
decade—that the leadership of the
Party might be moving to rid itself of
the incubus partner in the coalition. But
Whitlam, who, as deputy to Mr. Arthur
Calwell, had twice in the early ’sixties
moved for the disaffiliation of the Vic-
torian Branch, didn’t have the will or
the ability to push it through when he
came to the top. Indeed, he has been
forced, through the Adelaide Confer-
ence, to adopt much of the Left’s
foreign policy. The “ultimatum policy”
on Vietnam is a clear continuation of
the Left line in this, the most important
of foreign-policy questions, saddling
him with the ridiculous policy that Aus-
tralia should throw a lot of demands
at its American ally and, if they are
not met, pull out of Vietnam, an act
which would destroy our alliance with
America. As a concession, Mr. Whitlam
has been allowed to get away with
praising Singapore and Indonesia as
great nations, though the Left despises
them for their tough treatment of Com-
munists. In domestic matters there have
been for him mercifully few contentious
matters to disturb his coalition of Right
and Left. ETU and Postal Workers’
elections passed without a unity ticket
incident, since no endorsed Communists
stood for election, and the expulsion
from the ALP of the well-known secre-
tary of the Council for Civil Liberties,
Mr. John Bennett, has caused remark-
ably little stir so far. However, if he
appeals to the Federal Executive and
if, as it should be, his case is taken up
by the DLP and the Liberals in the
election campaign, it could become
divisive.
In this mess Mr. Whitlam has proved
just about as adept as might be ex-
pected in attempting to paper over the
cracks. In domestic policy he has talked
away freely without verbal opposition
from the Left. There he is busy want-
ing to harness the scientific and tech-
nological revolution to Australia’s ad-
vantage and there is the Left opposed
to every tiny attempt even to modify
the medieval apprenticeship system and
introduce modern trade education. But
this is the kind of tension that can be
ridden over in an opposition party,
however seriously it might later explode
if that party became the Government.
Whitlam hasn’t eliminated any of the
fundamental antagonisms of his party
by the Gaitskell-Saragat kind of show-
down with the sort of people who say
they are closer in the political spectrum
to the Communists than to anyone else.
But, with a. bit of luck, he has tempor-
ised his way through pretty well. In this
respect, he might be about to turn the
tables on the Government parties. For
all these years Labor disunity has been
a handy cry for the Government parties:
now they might be entering into their
own era of internal tension.
The long-delayed crisis of electoral
redistribution cannot now be put off
beyond early in the New Year. It is
constitutionally impossible to hold the
1969 elections without a redistribution
of seats for the House of Representa-
tives. Since 1955, when the present
boundaries were drawn, there has been
a revolutionary transformation in
population distribution. What were
once rural areas around the capital
cities have become suburbia, and the
Country Party seems bound to lose
when this fact of life is taken into
account, but it will struggle as hard as
it can to wangle a way out, and this
struggle will reverberate within the
Liberal Party.
However, this struggle may be noth-
ing compared with the coming struggle
for power over tariff policy. Holt has
tried half-heartedly to paper over dis-
putes on tariff policy, but there is now
a strong collection of groups and indi-
viduals (many supporters of the Liberal
Party) which support the Tariff Board
in its view that a more discriminating
approach to tariff protection is needed,
and that the time has come to allow
resources to flow into the productive
areas of manufacturing and prevent
them being tied up in high-cost, unec-
onomic industries. These people can-
not simply be wished away.
More fundamentally, high depart-
mentally administered tariffs are an
essential part of the Country Party’s
strategy for broadening its base into
the cities as its rural foundations are
eroded by economic and social change.
It is getting the financial support for its
transition to a Centre Party by selling
tariff protection to high-cost industry.
This must involve it in a clash with the
Liberals, on both ethical and earthy
financial scores.
But political leaders usually have
tensions in the parties they lead. What
worries the Prime Minister’s observers
more than any other single factor is
that his line of attack on the Labor
Party has not accounted for the
presence of its new leader. He seemed
to dither about whether policy on Viet-
nam was the real Senate election issue
or not, and he went into a tailspin over
the VIP aircraft affair so that Whitlam
was able to carry into the election cam-
paign itself an issue that a more adept
and perhaps more ruthless politician
would have emphatically closed with
a bang before the election campaign
began at whoever’s cost. Whitlam
has found an opponent. Holt has not.
He still seems to be shaping up to the
ghost of Arthur Calwell.
This seems a matter of moment for
Australia. Whatever skill he may have
in projecting an image, Whitlam still
leads a party that carries as part of
its program one of the silliest instruc-
tions in foreign policy ever given to
a potential Government.

The Surry Hills of the Sixties
By DAVID McGILL
“MOST SYDNEY people persist,”
says the pawmshop owner in Ruth
Park’s “The Harp in the South,” “in
thinking of Surry Hills in terms of
brothels, razor-gangs, tenements, and
fried-fish shops.” Twenty-five years later
Sydney people still think the same way,
so that the image of Surry Hills is
frozen in the prewar setting of “The
Harp in the South” and Kylie Ten-
nant’s “Foveaux,” where poor Irish
families struggle nobly in crumbling
tenements and dirty factories, where
thugs and prostitutes roam the narrow
streets by night.
This idea does not fit the Surry Hills
of the ’sixties. It is the city’s backyard
today, mostly because that’s where it is
on the map. The fights now are gen-
erally inconclusive affairs between 10
p.m. drinkers or the handful of resi-
dent winos. The prostitutes have
moved north across Oxford Street to
East Sydney and Kings Cross. The tene-
ments remain, but the Irish have moved
out. If Ruth Park were to set another
novel in Surry Hills, the representative
family would have to be Greek. Surry
Hills continues to be a working-class
suburb, but the New Australians,
mainly the Greeks, have changed its
face. It could not be termed a face-
lift but rather a patchwork of brightly
colored repair alongside dismal brown
disrepair.
The few square miles of Surry Hills
can be covered in a good evening’s
walk. Crammed between Central Rail-
way Station and Taylor Square, the
area is mainly batches of two-storeyed
terraced houses. Many are a hundred
or more years old. A good number look
their age. The one addition to the ori-
ginal design is the übiquitous television
aerial. Kylie Tennant wrote in
“Foveaux”: “In these terraces the build-
ers had striven to preserve all the nar-
row discomforts of Victorian architec-
ture. The doors and windows success-
fully defended the houses against the
entrance of light and air. The halls
were measured to allow one human
body to pass through at a time. The
great success was the roofs, pitched to
allow for the fall of snow.”
The Surry Hills houses may be uni-
form in age and price (from $lO,OOO to
$15,000), but they do not lack variety
in color. About half of the houses,
usually in groups of two or three, are
exuberantly painted: green-every thing
is the most favored color scheme.
Because the backyards are not big
enough to swing a kitten in, the child-
ren play in the streets and some of
the washing is hung in the front bal-
conies, among the caged budgies, pot-
plants, and old men and women, dozing
and watching passersby.
In the narrow lanes rubbish accumu-
lates. Here and there the plain brick
multi-storeys of factories, hospitals, and
modern flats rise above the houses.
Most of the suburb’s light industry is at
the city end, where it keeps the streets
dirty; the industry of Redfern provides
a similar service for the other end.
Some compensation for the dirt are the
plane trees that line most footpaths and
the several parks grouped in the middle
of Surry Hills. Here there are swings
for the children and seats for strollers
and winos. The band of winos wanders
between the parks, where they some-
times make use of the chessboards inlaid
in the benches, and the lanes, where
they lie in the sun-traps and argue
politics and the price of wine. The
local branch of the Sydney City Mis-
sion or abandoned terrace houses pro-
vide their accommodation.
As a tribute to the thirst of the hard-
working citizens of Surry Hills, there
are pubs on every second corner; the
chief feature, of their uncomplicated
designs are the numbers of entrances.
At any time of the long drinking day
elbows are being lifted all round the
well-worn semi-circular bars; behind a
panel there is the more refined tipping
of little fingers in the ladies’ parlors,
which are patronised by a smaller but
just as loyal middle-aged clientele.
On every other corner there is an
all-purpose store, usually run by a
Greek. Some of these have become
clubs where Greek men congregate of
an evening. The sunny steps of an old
stone public school, of a similar but
more interesting design to the churches,
are another place where they gather
after work to chat while their children
race around and old ladies in black
doze in corners.
The city of Sydney continues to be
Surry Hills’ main shopping and enter-
tainment area. For many, the city
markets are closer than the Surry Hills
shopping centre, which is down at the
Redfern boundary. For entertainment
there is little alternative. Surry Hills
has no fashionable restaurants, theatres,
art galleries, library, or community
centre.
Nowadays it’s a joke round here
that the Greeks own half of Surry
Hills,” said an elderly Australian who
has clocked up 40 years in the district.
Most of the milk-bars, stores, fish-shops,
photo studios, travel agencies, delica-
tessens, hairdressers, and land agents in
Surry Flills are Greek, and cater
especially for Greeks. Other New Aus-
tralians in the area include Italians,
Spanish, Germans, Dutch, and Maltese,
but more than half are Greek. Where
there were once Brodies and Caseys,
Murphys and O’Briens, there are now
the Melases and the Zeratases, the
Degiorgils and the Tsagerises.
“I’ll say this for them,” said the
elderly Australian who had the joke
on the Greeks, “they’re hard workers.”
That’s real praise from a retired work-
ing man. “They’re a decent crowd,”
was the assessment of a leathery Aus-
tralian who has lived in Surry Hills for
25 years. “Always bid you ‘Good day’
in the street. They prefer their own
lingo, but they’re good for a mag.
Their families seem to be happy, and
they look after their kids better than
most Australians. ” An old man, a
long-established resident, really spelled
out his appreciation of immigrants:
“With the advent of the New Australian
there’s been a vast improvement round
here. They’ve bought up houses that
were falling to pieces, that I wouldn’t
think of living in. They’ve done them
up, and the houses are a credit to them.
We get on well. There’s not the
animosity there used to be toward
them. Today, believe me, it’s a very
nice working-class suburb.”
The Greeks and other New Aus-
tralians are established in Surry Hills
but do not intend to stay. They make
the best of it while they are here. A
middle-aged Greek who had been in
the district 15 years summed up this
attitude: “I keep my place tidy because
I gotta live in it. I keep it at my own
expense. You can’t depend on the land-
lord. A long time ago I ask the land-
lord to sell me the house, but he say
no. He owns the whole block.” In a
month this Greek was moving his family
to his own house in an outer suburb.
“You should see my house when I
come,” said an indignant Greek.
“Scratched walls, cockroaches, trees
growing through the floor. I pulled
up six layers of lino and bricked in the
sloping floor. Then came the backyard.
It took me six months. That was ten
years ago. Now' the landlord would
like me to go so he bump up the rent
if he tries I’ll bump him. He offered
me $3200 for the key I paid $l3OO
for. He owns this street and the
next. It’s not a good area for bringing
up kids too dirty from the industry
and trucks and people throwing rub-
bish in the streets. They live like pigs.
The streets should be for people, not
rubbish. The women drink too much.
There are fights. Some people think
they’re King Farouks. I’ve gotta good
job, but some people have been here
all their lives and all they do is drink
and bet horses. That way you can t
buy a house.”

fully call a mixed

young women with children, echoed
these complaints about dirt and poor
conditions for bringing up children.
They liked the idea of big, clean fiats,
felt no attraction for the old terraced
houses, and all said they intended to
move to the outer suburbs.
A different attitude was implicit in
an Old Australian’s comment: “You
have to live where your job is. We’ve
been here 25 years because my husband
works in the city.” A tall, sparse Aus-
tralian from the Chips Rafferty mould
drawled laconically: “I’ve lived here 25
years and I reckon it’s as good as any-
where.” As Ruth Park observed, the
residents have never been overly articu-
late. In Kylie Tennant’s “Foveaux”
a woman is complaining that the land-
lord takes no notice when you want
a leaking roof fixed. “I’m always saying
I’ll leave the place,” she says, “and
I will, too.” Her friend replies: “Not
you. Only way you’ll leave is in your
coffin. You’ll never walk out.”
“We’re known as the Potts Point of
Surry Hills,” proudly declared a resi-
dent of Richards Avenue, the suburb’s
upper-working-class street. Here the
attachment to Surry Hills is understand-
ably strong. Richards Avenue not only
has trees down the footpaths but also
down the centre of the road; what is
more, they are not just plane trees, as
in the rest of Surry Hills. The 50 or so
houses in the street are brick, with tiled
roofs, and hedges and shrubs out front.
“Built about 1890 and hardly a crack
in them,” was the proud opinion of a
middle-aged resident. “They’re in such
good nick because we all own our
houses.”
In Richards Avenue the people were
proud of the district’s stormy past, but
thankful that it was now quiet. “In the
old days,” said an old man, “Surry
Hills was fa'r from salubrious, with
gambling and prostitution, sly-grog
joints, thugs like the Station and Riley
Street gangs. When we were first over
here, 30 years ago, there used to be
dancing to an accordion in the streets
on New Year’s Eve. And the City
Mission people used to sing in the
streets on a Sunday. They don’t any
more, but they still do a good job for
the derelicts and poor kids in the area
with their soup kitchens and accommo-
dation and afternoon teas on Sunday.
That’s what I believe in, a crust of
bread here.” Another oldtimer remem-
bered that it was “pretty rough with
mobs like the Forty Thieves. They’ve
been cleaned up probably got
married.”
In “Foveaux,” Miss Tennant picked
up the history of Surry Hills in 1912,
when it was still separate from the
city, with its “own council, mayor, and,
some maintained, own smell. The region
was then divided into Upper Foveaux,
Middle Foveaux, and the Foot. Upper
Foveaux breathed a rarefied air and
was “secure in the sunlight” from the
factories. There the vicar, the lawyer,
and the landowners could look down
over the towering stone walls from
which the magnolia dropped its petals
on to Middle Foveaux. Here the rows
and rows of terraces separated Upper
Foveaux from Plug Alley, where the
Rose of Denmark pub was “a landmark
for nervous policemen. A wasps’ nest
where gathered not only thirsty souls in
search of nectar but dark, weaponed
men in search of plunder.” At that time
the city, “like a surrounding sea, en-
compassed and surged upward toward
Foveaux. Yet no matter how the city
might flow, Upper Foveaux, impreg-
nable on its peak, stood aloof from the
roar of urban progress.” The novel tells
of the march of progress and of slums
up the hill.
Much of the history of Surry Hills
is still there in the terrace houses.
Although of little interest to the immi-
grants anxious to live the good life, they
are appreciated by another and very
small section of the district’s floating
population, students and artists. Kylie
Tennant writes that “there was a certain
quaintness in the ornate wrought-iron,
gilded and tortured into balcony rails,
edgings, cornices, and any possible pro-
jection, until the houses looked as
though they had been trimmed with
mouldy lace.” This “mouldy lace” is
very much in vogue in nearby Pad-
dington. In Surry Hills it is often ripped
down, which prompted an artist living
in Bourke Street to growl: “I don’t like

the way people are pulling down those
beautiful old railings and putting up
fibroboard and all that imitation brick
and stone.” A pretty girl student several
streets away enthused: “I think Surry
Hills is fascinating visually. There are
so many contradictions in the archi-
tecture —beaut old terrace houses, some
traditional with old lace ironwork, and
next door the solid brick German-style
with little turrets. I think the modern
flats look hideous. Just because they’re
cheap they don’t have to look nasty.”
However, with respect to the “Potts
Point of Surry Hills,” the area is a
poor man’s Paddington. This at pre-
sent brings its own rewards. “It’s a
working-class place,” said the girl
student, “and people don’t come here
to be ‘in’ like they do in Paddo. I like
it because it’s close to the city, the
Cross, the markets it’s very cheap
living, and the Greek food is interesting.
But, most of all, the people mind their
own business. Of course,” she added,
“you could be stabbed and screaming
here and nobody w'ould take any notice.
At least middle-class people would want
to know what w'as going on.”
The Greeks will go the way of the
Irish, but Surry Hills will stay respect-
able vvorking class and light industry,
with the factories continuing to en-
croach. “It is probable,” was the careful
prediction of a spokesman for the Town
Planning Branch of the City Engineers
Department, “that as much as 40 per-
cent of Surry Hills will be zoned for
industry.” That is the excuse many
landlords use for not doing up tenement
blocks. The Council continues to carry
out minor redevelopment, such as the
proposal to build flats in Alexander
Street. The only major redevelopment
was the Sir John Northcott Place,
carried out by the Housing Commission.
One of its employees said that 290
sub-standard dwellings were replaced
by 592 flats, most of them in the 15-
storey Northcott Place. This $3,000,000
project was finished in 1962, and with
it the Commission’s interest in Surry
Hills. It has gone on to more urgent
slum eradication in Redfern and Water-
loo.
Surry Hills could one day become
fashionable like Paddington, because so
many of the terraced houses are there
to stay, and in the meantime the immi-
grants make good caretakers. As Syd-
ney’s smog thickens there may well be
another reason for moving to Surry
Hills, if this comment from an old lady
is to be believed: “I’ve been here over
40 years and I’ve never had a day’s sick-
ness. It’s very healthy here. It’s because
it’s high up, you know.”
For the time being Surry Hills con-
tinues its traditional task of providing
the city’s industries with a valuable
labor pool. It quietened down when
late closing knocked the sly-grog racket
on the head and when the fighting
Irish moved out; it brightened up when
the New Australian families moved in.

10 years from now,
SO FAR, selling seats for inter-con-
tinental air travel has at least had one
simplicity about it there have been
basic similarities in the actual aircraft
used by the different airlines. They
have ail been long tubes, with much
the same seating capacity, much the
same general cabin layout, and much
the same speed. Airlines have estab-
lished “product differences” from each
other by their general reputation for
safety (which is connected with pas-
sengers’ attitudes to the nation from
which an airline comes), by specialties
in service both on the ground and in
flight, and by the general tone or
ambience of service. Factors like
these come together to construct an
airline’s image.
A few years from now the marketing
strategy of airlines (or “getting bums
on seats” as they call it in the
business) will have a new difficulty.
Aircraft will stop being the same. A
few years from now the same airline
will be selling seats on quite different
aircraft offering quite different services.
The two top horses in its stable will
be two different models of supersonic
aircraft. It will probably have some
British-French Concordes, designed to
carry 130 passengers at 1400 miles an
hour, reducing an Atlantic crossing
from 6 hours 40 minutes to 3 hours
10 minutes or a Sydney-London flight
from 37 hours to 17 hours 15 minutes;
and it wilt probably also have some
American Boeing 27075, designed to
carry 300 passengers at 1800 miles an
hour, bringing an Atlantic crossing
down a further 25 minutes or a Sydney-
London flight a further 1 hour 35
minutes. (The first prototype Con-
corde is scheduled to be in the air
within three months and the first com-
mercial Concorde by February, 1970.
The Boeing 2707 is expected to be in
service by 1975.)
The fact that there are differences
in capacity and speed and probably
in image between the two supersonic
models obviously involves some prob-
lems for an airline of how it packages
up two different supersonic aircraft as
if they were both the same. But the
real difficulty is that the supersonics
will contrast with three other types of
aircraft, each of which will also contrast
with the other.
Of these the novelty items are the
“Jumbo” jets, the Boeing 7475, the
biggest aircraft yet designed for com-
mercial service, the first of which is
expected to emerge in 1968, ready for
a year of intensive flight-testing before
certification and initial deliveries. Al-
though on a mass configuration the 747 s
(with a flight deck two storeys high)
could carry up to 500 passengers, air-
lines will arrange them to allow greater
comfort and difference in service. Qan-
tas, for example, will do up its 747 s
with accommodation for about 50 first-
class passengers and 300 in economy
class. With the 747 s the feeling of
being in a tube will disappear. With
eight-foot ceilings, cabin walls that are
almost vertical, and a swath of carpet,
the interior of a 747 will be rather
like that of an art theatre. And while
economy-class passengers, seated nine
or ten abreast, will enjoy greater
spaciousness than there is in the first-
class compartment of today’s planes,
the rich or the richly expense-
accounted, in their upstairs stateroom,
connected with the economy section by
a spiral staircase, will be able to enjoy
some of the comforts of a luxury liner.
There will be 20 or so cabin staff,
food specialties, and opportunities for
wide-screen movies or even live shows
featuring top artists as well as the
present midget-screen movies and sound
programs.
This means that an airline will be
offering both a kind of “luxury liner”
service (in the Jumbo jet) and a faster-
than-sound tube service (in two different
models and at a not yet determined
higher price). To add to the confusion,
it will probably also be offering some
of the present subsonic aircraft (in most
cases Boeing 7075), which offer neither
faster-than-sound speeds nor the extra
luxuries of Jumboism; and as well as
these, in European flights at least, an
airline will probably also be offering
gigantic air buses, good for short-haul
travel of up to 2000 miles, with huge
but more economic engines which will
allow special fare reductions.
At present if a customer exercises
choice it is usually in terms of an
airline’s image rather than of his im-
pressions of the type of aircraft it
flies. But in the next decade aircraft
loyalties may become more significant.
Some 'may prefer one supersonic aircraft
to the other. Some may prefer the
extra comfort of a Jumbo jet. Some
may prefer the economy of an air bus.
Someone who wants to fly to New York
on November 25, 1977, may like Con-
cordes better than 27075. Qantas are
flying a Concorde that day; Pan Am a
2707. He rather likes Pan Am, but
he chooses Qantas because it offers the
supersonic aircraft that for some reason
or other he prefers. Someone else may
be flying to Rome: Qantas only have
a Boeing 707 on that day, but BOAC
are flying a Jumbo jet. Although he
prefers Qantas, he chooses ' BOAC be-
cause he prefers Jumbo jets more than
he prefers Qantas.
Businessmen sometimes choose air-
lines for prestige reasons. As well as.
the present jumble of emotions that
make up their prestige choices there
will occur the additional complexity
of whether their emotional insecurities
are better served by supersonic speed
and extra cost or by sitting around the
bar in the bigger and more pampering
Jumbo jet.
Above all there is the marketing-
problem of what simple idea can best
project an airline’s image when it is
a supersonic tube, a luxury liner, a
conventional tube, and an air bus all
at once.
These are the problems of 1977. Be-
fore then will come the problems of
re-equipment. Already 120 Jumbo jets
are on order. Pan Am will be first in
the air with them, since it took up
the first 25 numbers in Boeing’s order
book. It will probably put them first on
to the transatlantic run, because it is
the most profitable, and then on to the
other mass-movement routes, from the
U.S. to South America, for instance, or
on the bus-stop run to Hawaii. Will
it put them on to the transpacific
route to Australia before Qantas, which
gets the four Jumbos it has already
ordered (for $123 million) in 1971?
Qantas cleaned up the transpacific
business for a while when it was the
first airline to put jets on this route,
in 1959. This time, will Pan Am come
in ahead of Qantas? Perhaps the
“stretched” versions of existing sub-
sonic types will not be able to hold out
in opposition to the Jumbos, unless they
can be confined to routes where the
mass-movers will not be economic.
Meanwhile, some of the image build-
ers are even worried about that word
“Jumbo”. Does it suggest speed? Does
it suggest safety? Does it suggest com-
fort? Or does it suggest a slow, un-
certain lumbering. Qantas say they
are happy about it. “What can you do
but love a Jumbo?” said Mr. John Ulm,
the chief of Qantas’ Press and informa-
tion office, and, when Qantas’ purchase
of the Jumbos was announced, they got
a congratulatory telegram from the
Commonwealth Bank, saying: “Always
glad to hear of people getting with the
strength.” But Pan Am are said to be
a bit concerned about their domestic
response to an elephant of an aircraft
because the elephant is the symbol of
the Republican Party.
Pricing considerations will be built
into image-making. Captain Bert
Ritchie, the general manager of Qantas,
has said that the Concorde could call
for fare increases of from 15 to 20 per-
cent. The later Boeing 2707 will not


only be larger and faster but more
economical, but this may not lead to
price reduction because it will also cost
twice as much to buy. On the other
hand, while supersonic travel will be
more expensive, subsonic travel will
(eventually) cost less. Sir Giles Guthrie,
the chairman of BOAC, said in Sydney,
this month, that the airline industry
would, first have to absorb some of the
huge costs of the Jumbos and that about
twi years after that the fares would go
down. The air - bus fares would, of
course, end up even lower than Jumbo
fares, so that eventually there will be
a three-tiered price structure within
each airline, with both first and
economy sub-categories within two of
the three main categories. (Air buses
will probably 'be all tourist fare.)
It will cost about $f million per
airport merely to put in the handling-
equipment to service one Jumbo at a
time, and at an airport like London’s
Heathrow about S2O million will be
needed for new ground installations,
buildings, and hangars. In addition,
there are high costs for spares and
backing-up equipment. The total cost
of taking Australia alone into the era
of Jumboism will be something like
SIBO million s4s million for runway
extensions, $123 million for the four
Jumbos Qantas is buying, and sl2 mil-
lion for hangars, buildings, and handling
equipment. So much extra will be spent
on the ground that airlines will share
facilities even more than they do now.
The illusion has already faded that the
airline you have flown by is looking
after you when you arrive at an air-
port; it may now altogether vanish. The
exclusive destination service an airline
offers its customers will have to be built
around tour advice and so forth at its
city office, a type of service in which
all airlines are still comparatively weak,
but which in the future may become
one of their more important competi-
tive differences.
The era of speed novelty is now
approaching its close. The airline
business has been pushed along in a
race of expensive technological change
in which the main incentive has been
time-cutting. Short of rockets, there is
not much more time to be cut. In the
routes that provide most of the busi-
ness, the supersonic models will be fast
enough. The enormous technological
cost of cutting another half hour or so
off the transatlantic run would not be
worth the money. If aircraft are not
likely to get much faster, to provide
extra speed technological advance must
now be grounded, to produce that
revolution in traffic handling that
a faster-than-sound tube?
a luxury liner?
a bus?
The answer is all three. And this
raises entirely new marketing and image-
building problems for the airline business

makes the new air speeds worth while.
Passengers and cargoes have to be
got on and off aircraft more quickly,
passengers have to be detached from
and reunited with their luggage more
quickly whether by monorail, ex-
pressway, or hover units depends on
each individual city.
Behind the immense new sums to
be spent on the supersonics lies the
> airlines’ nagging fear that passengers
may not think the extra speed worth
the extra money. At the top end of
the market, for which the supersonics
are aimed, money might not matter
all that much, but discomfort does and,
although supersonics get you there
more quickly, their very speed accen-
tuates the “out-of-phase” syndrome
already characteristic of long-distance
travel. Racing the sun, a Concorde
passenger leaving London just after
breakfast will arrive in New York just
before breakfast. His 'body will know
it is midday and, to get his body right
quickly, he should have lunch.at New
York’s breakfast-time, dinner at New
York’s lunchtime, and go to 'bed at
New York’s cocktail-time; but if he
does this, what has he gained by get-
ting to New York so quickly?
It will be lower prices that will lead
to continuing expansion in the airline
business, once the huge costs of accom-
modating it to both supersonics and
Jumbos have been met. The prototype
airline passenger of the past has been
the expense-account executive. The
expensive business of increasing speed
has been justified by imagining this
executive as dashing here, there, and
everywhere so quickly that it is worth
thousands of millions of dollars to get
him somewhere a couple of hours ear-
lier. But this day is over his desire
for prestige can still be accommodated
by making him pay more money so
that he can enjoy a special service that
enables him to go to bed at cocktail-
time. But it is the tourist (who is
sometimes the executive in another dis-
guise) who in the next ten or 20 years
will swamp the airline business. As
affluence expands among the affluent
more and more of its lucky recipients
will want to spend their holiday money
flying off to look at each other, or to
fly off and look at the picturesqueness
of the un-affluent. In an age in which
tourism will represent one of the main
sources of foreign capital and one
of its main losses in the world’s
prosperous countries more and more
bums will settle down on to more and
more seats in the world’s airlines.
When the price is right.
The airlines should sock the big
expense-account man as much as they
can. Surround him with more and
more prestigious novelties. Sell him
the old-fashioned idea of an airline.
But in getting extra tourist traffic they
will have to think up new images of
airlines related to the coming techno-
logical and market changes.

OVERSEAS
How Britain caused the
run on the pound
OF ALL BRITAIN’S post-war crises,
this was the strangest. The world has
been like an audience waiting for the
start of some amateur dramatics,
watching with a mixture of amusement
and alarm while confused cries and
shouts emerge from behind the cur-
tains; while every now and again the
curtains are hoisted uncertainly aloft
to reveal a man scurrying into the
wings without his trousers.
Finally, with dramatic impact, came
the development. It was devaluation
after all.
How did this oddest of crises begin?
Britain’s trade figures published last
week showed a deficit for October of
£stglo7 million. This could be largely
put down to the dock strike and need
not have been disastrous had sterling
not already been on a knife-edge. The
trouble was that every crisis, follow-
ing its predecessor with mechanical
regularity, destroys a little more of
the world’s confidence in the exchange
rate of the pound, and the confidence
never quite comes back.
So the need to keep cool and make
it look as if Britain is coping is greater
every time, and, last week, accident or
malice or ineptitude or a combina-
tion of them all produced a public-
relations exercise that was farcical as
well as sad. Bad trade figures were
expected: and it was known that
on December 2 Britain was due to
repay $U.5.250 million to the Inter-
national Monetary Fund, the last in-
stalment of a SU.S.IOOO million loan
floated in October, 1964, as part of
the salvage work of that nearly dis-
astrous autumn.
Governors of European central banks
were meeting in Basle, as they do on the
second weekend in every month, and it
was natural to suppose they would
discuss the pound and its troubles.
These Basle meetings are supposed to
give central bankers the chance to meet
informally, on neutral ground. A net-
work of loans, promises, and moral
support has grown up between the
central banks of the West since 1945,
and the bankers slip off to Basle for
weekends that are private, though not
quite as private as they were ten years
ago.
They chose Basle because the Bank
for International Settlements is there:
a bank for central bankers, set up in
1930 to handle war reparations, which
has very little money of its own; but
brings together the countries that have.
Before the bankers met at Basle, sterl-
ing, shaken by rumors that the Deut-
schmark would be revalued, had been
having a bad time.
The bank rate was raised to try to
prevent dollars leaving London, with-
out success. Then the day before the
trade figures were due the “Financial
Times” reported from Basle that “lead-
ing Western industrial countries” were
going to lend Britain $250 million via
the BIS, so that Britain could pay off
the IMF next month.
The new loan was tied specifically
to repaying this old loan, and, in any
case, it wasn’t the kind of amount to
stop a run on the pound should one
develop (the last time that happened,
in November, 1964, 12 times as much
was needed). But it was a step in the
right direction. On Tuesday evening,
confirmation of the little loan came at
last from the British Treasury. On
Wednesday, the foreign-exchange
markets were jumpy. On Wednesday
evening came a second and bigger
leak.
The BBC reported on the 8.50 tele-
vision news that a loan to Britain of
$lOOO million was being negotiated in
Paris, where another clutch of central
bankers and British Treasury men was
meeting committees of the Organisa-
tion for Economic Co-operation and
Development, followed by the Group of
Ten, which takes in the United States,
Canada, Japan, and most of those who
matter in Europe. The central bankers
meeting in Paris would certainly have
known about any loan, though it would
have involved even bigger brass back
at the banks themselves—who, in any
case, are constantly on the phone to one
another. People paid attention to what
the Group of Ten was doing, because
this was one point where the inter-
national money-men were actually vis-
ible.
By Thursday morning the report was
circulating busily among both journal-
ists and foreign-exchange dealers, who
have an international instant-gossip net-
work that will take a rumor round the
globe in ten minutes. The money, it
was said, was to come from either the
BIS or from the other nine in the
Group of Ten.
Among the Labor supporters who
were alarmed by the prospect of a
big loan, that might have unpleasant
conditions attached to it were two
young maverick MPs, Joel Barnett and
Robert Sheldon, both long-term advo-
cates of devaluation.
Defying cautionary advice from the
Whips, they insisted on Thursday
morning on tabling urgent questions
to the Prime Minister and the Chan-
cellor. The news was brought into
the Cabinet while it was in session,
and Ministers heard with dismay that
the Speaker had decided to call one
of the questions.
They didn’t know, and the Leader
of the House, Mr. Crossman, discov-
ered only later, that where two simi-
lar questions are tabled, the Speaker
feels he must call the one addressed to
the senior Minister in this case,
Mr. Wilson.
The Cabinet agreed that Mr. Callag-
han would answer. He would fob off
the MPs, since the negotiations for the
loan were incomplete, and any discus-
sion might prejudice them. (There’s no
precedent in Parliamentary history for
a Commons debate on financial negoti-
ations while they’re still in progress.)
The fact that the question would be
called, and that the Government would
answer it, was given out to journalists.
The Press Association reporter put what
seemed the obvious interpretation on

it, and rushed to telephone the news
that “the Prime Minister will be mak-
ing an announcement at 3.30” —that
is, at Question Time.
As soon as this went over the tapes
the City and the international com-
munity were on tenterhooks. At 3.30
the Flouse was packed, waiting for Mr.
Wilson to get to his feet.
Instead, it was the Chancellor who
rose to speak, and then, having risen,
managed to say nothing beyond the
fact that talk of a loan was “a Press
rumor,” which it would be wrong of
the Government to confirm or deny.
This was the nonstatement and anti-
climax that really started the run on
the pound. It suggested that either
there wasn’t going to be a loan or that
it was a loan with such strings attached
that the Government was divided about
accepting. Two panics developed
simultaneously: on the financial front,
draining reserves, and on the political
front, draining confidence in Harold
Wilson.
As soon as this disastrous effect
became apparent the U.S. Treasury
moved in with a statement of its own.
This came at a Press conference taken
by the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry-
Fowler, which had been previously
called to announce the U.S. quarterly
balance-of-payments figures. Ironically,
these were bad as well. They showed
a deficit rising from $550 million in the
second quarter to $670 million in the
third, figures that the American
economy is big and resilient enough to
stand.
Journalists in Washington who called
the Treasury after Callaghan’s refusal
to speak were turned away at first, but
were later telephoned by the Treasure
and advised to attend the Fowler con-
ference.
A British reporter, John Whale, of
Independent Television News, asked
Fowler about sterling, and got a care-
fully worded reply in which Fowler
said that Wilson and Callaghan had
“faced the issue with great determina-
tion,” adding that “I have no doubts
as to their success.” The statement
ended: “The United States has a con-
sistent record of multilateral financial
co-operation; a record which we intend
to maintain.” It was a helpful indica-
tion that America, fearful of a British
devaluation if only because it might
transfer the speculative pressure to the
dollar, still had its heart in the right
place.
It’s possible that the story of the loan
was leaked by the French in order to
embarrass Britain. French newspapers
said that, on the contrary, it was a
Wilsonian plot to prepare the British
public for the worst.
Nothing really explains Mr.
Callaghan’s performance in the Com-
mons on Thursday. The British
Treasury has a reputation for being
inept at public relations, and it might
have been asking too much for it to
call in senior journalists and brief them
in confidence.
But the Chancellor could have said
something soothing. Why, asked a senior
Whitehall official, didn’t he use one of
those well-tried formulas: “Inter-
national negotiations, in which I have
every confidence, are taking place, and
naturally the House will not expect me
to say anything further at this time.”?
The pound would have hardened and
Friday’s appalling drain on the reserves
-—when the Bank of England had to
exchange at least £lOO millions worth
of its gold and dollars for sterling that
no one else would buy—might have
been blocked.
A crisis was unavoidable, but it need
not have been a crisis on this scale.
It was a failure to recognise how sen-
sitive the world has grown to the
health of sterling that gave the week’s
events a uniquely bitter flavor.
The roots of the trouble go right
back to October, 1964, and the basic
incompatibility between the policies to
which Labor was pledged and the
exigencies of sterling. It was intensified
by Wilson’s decision on taking office to
forswear devaluation: the pound, he
promised, would be able to look the
dollar in the face.
Because of this first, basic decision
the Government has been dependent
on successive loans from the central
banks and the International Monetary
Fund. Because of this dependence, the
British Government has been obliged
to backpedal on the policies its sup-
porters expected it to pursue. There
was, Lord Cromer later revealed, no
written agreement between the Govern-
ment and the foreign bankers, but there
was “an understanding.”
The first crisis, a few weeks after
taking office, in November, 1964, was
attributed to the famous Tory legacy
the £BOO-million deficit. It led the
Labor Government to seek the first
international loans and to impose a
15 percent import surcharge. But,
against the views of Lord Cromer, who
was then Governor of the Bank of
England, this did not stop it raising
pensions and abolishing prescription
charges.
In the summer of 1965, fresh loans
were required, and Mr. Callaghan went
to Washington to obtain them. The
Americans were insisting at that time
on a wage freeze. But the Chancellor
persuaded them that voluntary restraint
would be sufficient. The freeze followed
only the next year, after the election.
Thus for these first two crises the
British Government stuck to its plans
for bold economic expansion. But when
the big crisis broke, in July, 1966, Wil-
son was forced to deflate, returning to
the “stop-go” formula against which he
had fought two elections. For some time
he had been getting warnings from the
Treasury that the situation was getting
out of hand. Wilson flew off to Moscow,
leaving instructions for the famous de-
flationary package to be got ready—and
returned to find Foreign Secretary
George Brown on the brink of resigna-
tion. Brown, supported by the leading
spokesmen of the radical Right, Roy
Jenkins and Anthony Crosland, had

AUSTRALIA’S LEADING PERMANENT BUILDING SOCIETY
been advocating devaluation as an
alternative to shutting down the policy
of economic growth. In the event, Wil-
son’s policy prevailed and, for the first
time, the Bank of England had reason
to be entirely happy with the Labor
Government’s reactions to crisis. Labor
backbenchers, on the contrary, were
very unhappy.
Up to this point Wilson had managed
to maintain his image in Britain as the
honest man who kept his promises.
Prom this point on his image rested on
his willingness to take a national view
of his country’s problems a peace-
time Churchill, calling for sacrifices
even from his own supporters. But all
the time he was hag-ridden by memories
of 1931, when the then Labor Prime
Minister Ramsay MacDonald “be-
trayed” his party and accepted a coali-
tion with his political enemies to pursue
policies dictated by the bankers. More
surprisingly, Wilson remained stub-
bornly determined not to devalue.
One by one, by-elections went against
the Government. No administration
since World War I has had a
worse electoral record: out of nine
seats defended since the 'last election
Labor has lost six; in the past weeks
and months, as the present crisis was
gathering strength, morale in the Par-
liamentary Party began to sag and
crumble. The Left Wing could be dis-
counted, but increasingly they came
to be joined by elements on the Right
and in the solid centre of the party.
Obstinately, Wilson stuck to his
course, limiting his options by deliber-
ate choice and ignoring the deteriorat-
ing morale of his troops. It now seems
that early last month he and his Chan-
cellor, dominated by Treasury officials,
decided that another loan was required
to tide them over the coming winter.
The closure of the Suez Canal and the
long-standing Rhodesian problem,
topped up by the dock strikes in Liver-
pool and London, and credit squeezes
in Britain’s American and European
markets, had seriously threatened sterl-
ing. Quietly, negotiations were opened.
Provided secrecy could be main-
tained, there must have seemed no
reason for panic. Unfortunately for Wil-
son, and in contrast to the position in
1949, devaluation had been talked about
almost continuously. Many newspapers,
including the London “Observer,” were
in favor of it. In the recent economic
debate on the address-in-reply to the
Queen’s speech, almost every Labor
backbencher seemed to be advocating
it. But Wilson and Callaghan resisted.
In this they were supported by the
Bank of England and the central banks.
The U.S. feared for the dollar if the
pound were devalued. Even the Lrench
dreaded the fiercer competition that de-
valuation would bring. This was the
political background against which last
week’s events took place. But it has
been greatly inflamed by the bitter
party row over unemployment.
Although the figures are not now ex-
pected to be as large this winter as
had at one time been feared, the state-
ment by the Governor of the Bank of
England, Sir Leslie O’Brien, in Rio last
month that the Government now realis-
ed the economy could not be run with
the same small margin of unused
capacity as in the late ’forties and the
’fifties touched off a storm of protest
from Labor backbenchers. This was
greatly aggravated by Mr. Callaghan’s
spirited defence of Sir Leslie when the
House of Commons reconvened.
There is little doubt that Mr. Cal-
laghan was speaking at the time not
to his backbenchers but to his friends
and creditors, the central bankers.
They trust him. He wanted them to
know that he and the Governor of the
Bank of England, with whom they
were discussing Britain’s needs at Rio,
saw things exactly the same way.
To Labor backbenchers, however,
all this was too reminiscent of the
hideous mythology of 1931, “The
Great Betrayal.”
Their sense of imminent danger got
worse as the week dragged on. Many
MPs nervously contemplated the risks
of inter-party coalition, and few of
them doubted that that would mean the
end of the Labor Party.
Nobody expected the Prime Minis-
ter to abandon the reins of power ot-
to invite the Tories in merely to
reinforce confidence in sterling. What
was feared was a split among Minis-
ters; the terms for an international
loan, eight percent, turned out too
harsh for some of them to accept. The
British Cabinet meeting on Thursday,
at which the loan was discussed, lasted
suspiciously long. Members of Parlia-
ment were afterwards convinced that
the Ministers who had opposed the de-
flationary package deal in July, 1966
Brown, Jenkins, and Crosland
were this time being backed by the
leading Left-wingers, Barbara Castle
and Tony Greenwood. Both of these
were in charge of Ministries, Transport
and Housing, which stood to lose
heavily if international creditors in-
sisted on economies in public spending.
The Tories, though decorously
gloomy about the pound, could not help
relishing the Government’s evident dis-
comfiture. Mr. Heath let it be known
that he found no appeal in the prospect
of coalition, which he felt was suitable
only in time of war. He argued that
if the Cabinet did split and Mr. Wilson
could no longer command a majority,
then it was his duty to go back to the
country. (All the prominent public-
opinion polls show that there would
be a Tory landslide.)
Provisionally, at least, Labor by the
weekend had begun to feel that now
was the time for all good men to come
to the aid of the party.

If you’re wondering how we manage to cover that
many miles an hour, the answer is really
very simple. We do it by going so many places. All
at once. Just as we’re about to take off in San
Francisco, we’re landing in Hong Kong, circling over
Manila, approaching Zamboanga, serving
cocktails above Honolulu, fastening seat belts in
Australia and taxiing in to Taipei. You
can see how a thing like that adds up. So there’s
really nothing new about flying
6,000 m.p.h. We do it every day.

Parini men don’t
disclose what they pay
tor their suits:
(around $100)
Many men in high places go out of their way to
buy Parini Suits. The gold signature of the Parini
label symbolises for them the dedication of tailors
of the “Old School”. Craftsmen whose skills were
handed down from father to son from the Guilds
of 16th century Florence. Parini fabrics reveal this
same insistence on excellence. Wherever a weaver
is known for the uniqueness of his cloths Parini
seeks him out. Is it surprising then, that so many
leaders insist on paying more for their Parini suits?

Indonesia
Gestapu in jail
TWO YEARS AFTER the abortive
communist coup on the night of Sep-
tember 30, 1965 Gestapu, as the
Indonesians call it the search for
suspected accomplices and supporters
is still going on. In some places the
Indonesian Army’s mopping-up opera-
tions are meeting active resistance,
especially in Kalimantan, Borneo,
where the resistance appears to be
organised.
There former Army General Suhe-
harjo, a Gestapu element, is reported
to be leading a guerilla force of about
700 men, which appears to be steadily
increasing in numbers as PKI (com-
munist) members from elsewhere in
Indonesia make their way to Kaliman-
tan’s jungles.
In other parts of Indonesia the mop-
ping-up operations seem to meet little
resistance. As more and more arrests
are made the congested jails and prison
camps (of which there are over 50 in
Java, frequently set up in disused fac-
tories and schools) have become a
problem, and the Government has been
forced to take measures to lessen the
pressure on the prisons and the over-
worked judiciary. Exactly how many
people have been jailed since Gestapu
is difficult to assess, (pfficially a few
months ago the number of people
arrested was put at between 220,000
and 250,000, and the number of
Gestapu-VKI activists in jail at 55,000.
Both these figures are regarded by in-
dependent observers as much too low.
Indonesians are reluctant to give any
specific estimate of the total arrested,
since many have since been released,
but some think it may be as high as
one million, while the number of people
still in jail may be between 80,000 and
150,000.
Over the past six months or so tens
of thousands of people have been re-
leased, and the daily releases now
seem to outnumber those being jailed.
These now comprise both Gestapu-
PKI members and individuals consid-
ered too closely linked with the “Old
Order.” This is because it is impossible
within a reasonable period of time to
investigate and put on trial all those
now in jail; the numbers are too large
and the job of investigating and try-
ing them all is enormous. So prisoners
are now being grouped in three cate-
gories: 4700 hard-core Gestapu-VYA
members who are to be tried within a
reasonable time; 6010 less fanatic ele-
ments plus those whose cases require
further investigation; and, third, people
who are not believed to have been too
seriously involved in Gestapu, and who
stand a good chance of being released.
Given the present rate of investiga-
tions and trial prisoners, a very long

time will elapse before justice is done
to the great majority of suspects. In the
meantime, they have to wait, in many
cases in appalling conditions. The main
civil jail in Djakarta where about-
-3000 Communists, pro-communist
artists and writers, academics, former
parliamentarians, and civil servants are
being held —is among the best. The
prisoners are allowed to receive food
parcels from relatives and share the
vegetables which they grow themselves
within the prison compound. Similar
conditions prevail in the “white collar
jails” in other cities. The military prison
in Djakarta and another just outside the
city—where former cabinet ministers
are held also treat their inmates
reasonably well.
But such prisons appear to be the
exception rather than the rule. Tan-
gerang jail, about 20 miles outside
Djakarta, where between 2000 and 5000
prisoners are held, is supposed to be
particularly bad. The inmates are mostly
lower-level PKI cadres, and they are,
according to Indonesian Press reports,
not allowed even the minimum food
ration of 0.4 kilograms of rice per day,
to say nothing of other needs. Since
most of the prisoners come from dis-
tant areas, their families can supply
only a little food. The buildings are
in a miserable state, sanitary conditions
revolting. The jail authorities are said
to be especially tough on the prisoners.
Similar conditions seem to prevail
in many jails all over the country... Food
supplies seem to be a crucial problem,
especially in Central Java where the
long drought has brought a threat of
famine. It has been reported that prison
authorities in Central Java were receiv-
ing food for only 10,000 of their 50,000
prisoners. In some places local Christian
charity organisations have provided
some help mostly clothing and
others are allowed to ea,t what they
grow themselves. A reliable local
source, however, told me near-starvation
conditions prevailed: “Prisoners who
have been released and others who have
visited jails and camps tell of inmates
Who look like mere skin and bones and
of hundreds dying of sheer neglect.”
Neglect or inability to do much
about the problem —seems to be tho
case, rather than deliberate Government
policy. In some respects, prisoners are
being treated better now than before:
reports of local Army Commanders
handing over prisoners to extremists,
who. give them short shrift, have ceased,
as have stories of summary executions
without trial. Such reports were fre-
quent during the days after the coup,
but are not heard these days.
Some high Government officials seem
to favor generosity in releasing prison-
ers on grounds that imprisonment em-
bitters the marginally involved and
makes him more pro-Communist
hot least because of his contact with
more committed prisoners. They also
argue that the wave of anti-Communism

it is no longer dangerous to allow
prisoners to return to their villages. It
will probably be easier to reclaim the
loyalty of PKI sympathisers in his own
village under tbe supervision of his
own community than in the jails.
Other more sceptical officials, how-
ever, are impressed by the high spirits
and stamina of PKI members, in or
out of jail, and point to their deter-
mination to make a come-back. , As
one high-ranking PKI member in jail

ditions prevail in Indonesia, there is
nothing that can make the PKI fold up.
There is every reason for the PKI to

U.S. Presidency
Romney the
Unready
NOW THAT HE has announced he
will be a candidate for Republican
nomination in next year’s U.S. Presi-
dential election, Governor George
Wilcken Romney, of Michigan, will get
ready for a staccato tour of western
and eastern Europe, partly to learn,
partly to make a start on reconstruct-
ing the reputation that clings to him of
a man at home on the home front
but ill-versed in international affairs.
A self-made rich man of sixty, Mr.
Romney has spent most of his career
in middle-western industry. He came
late to politics and his political repu-
tation rests on his performance as
Governor of Michigan over the past
five years: a slender base considering
what a huge and diverse following a
candidate for a presidential nomin-
ation, let alone for the Presidency,
needs.
A candidate younger, or more
sophisticated in world politics, "or politi-
cally more seasoned, or indeed all
three, would not have been difficult
to find. But it is behind Mr. Romney
that the leaders of the . moderate or
liberal cause in the Republican party,
and notably the two chief losers to
Mr. Goldwater in 1964, Governor Nel-
son Rockefeller and Governor Scran-
ton, have chosen to stand while the
opening moves in the presidential game
are played. More than anything else
this reflects their recognition that
mere lack of support w'ould not have
kept Mr. Romney out of the contest
for the Republican nomination.
Mr. Romney’s religion and internal
make-up have blended to produce this
unquenchable character. His paternal
great-grandfather was an English car-
penter who went West with a cart to
the new Mormon settlement in Utah
in 1850 and his grandfather was one

of the Mormons who moved to Mexico
rather than give up their institution of
polygamy; the fact that Mr. Romney
was born there in exile is a conceivable
ground for legal argument about his
eligibility for the Presidency. The
Pancho Villa rebellion drove the exile
community back to the United States
when the present Governor of Michi-
gan was five, and, although he did
not have an unhappy childhood, he
had a poor and arduous one.
Mr. Romney is not a bigot, he does
not surrender his political judgment to
the theologians; for instance, he has
stood firmly in word and action on an
enlightened view of Negro rights, which,
whatever ingenuity may be used
to reconcile the two, could not flow
naturally from the tenets of the Mormon
Church. But he wears his religion'on
his sleeve and his self-righteousness is
on occasion unashamed. Not only Mr.
Goldwater found this in 1964, when
he sought Mr. Romney’s support and
got a long lecture on the principles
Romney. .. starting his run
from which Mr. Romney was not pre-
pared to depart “one iota.” (Mr.
Goldwater has not forgotten. Asked
earlier this year what he thought of
Mr. Romney’s prospects, he said: “It all
depends if he decides to come back
to the Republican party.”) But Re-
publican moderates experienced his
self-righteousness just as keenly.
In other respects he embodies on a
scale larger than life the qualities
Americans are brought up to admire.
His energy is stupendous, his honesty
and sobriety total, his business achieve-
ments substantial; his jaw is strong, his
hair silver, his face ruddy and open,
his manner frank and warm, his voice
manly, his handshake firm, his step
brisk, his build solid but not without
elegance. His belief in free enterprise

is combined with a populist distrust of
corporate bigness.
It comes as a slight surprise that he
abhors protectionism and really believes
in international trade. A natural
generosity breaks through the crust of
puritan values: in the same way as he
is vehement for the just treatment of
Negroes and other underprivileged
minorities in America, he has a lively
concern for the developing nations; he
believes that the rich countries have
strong reasons to help them and feels
deeply about the international dangers
if they do not. The state of western
Europe and the neglect of its Euro-
pean relations by the United States
make him uneasy. These attitudes differ
from any stereotyped version of the
middle-western Republican outlook.
Equally, his attitude to the Vietnam
war differs. Here, however, not only is
the subject-matter complex and the
right path hard to see, but also the
Republican party tends to split on either
side of President Johnson’s position.
Mr. Romney’s difficulty in deciding
whether the war was right in the first
place, whether, now that it exists, it can
be settled by negotiation, whether Mr.
Johnson is to be rebuked for rash
belligerency or for indecisiveness dnd
hesitation, is a genuine difficulty which
many people more in the swim than
middle-western State governors share
with him. But when he is genuinely at
a loss, as he has quite understandably
been when he has talked about Vietnam
at different times, he lacks equally the
gift of silence, the political ruthlessness
necessary to take a stand and stick to
it right or wrong, and the dialectical
skill to present his uncertainties as
useful contributions to the thinking-out
of a national problem. It is this that
has brought his fortunes as a candidate
low, as, just now, they are.
Romney’s candidature is firm, but
two more interesting possibilities have
not as yet made their intentions official.
One is Senator Eugene McCarthy, who
clearly intends to announce that he will
oppose President Johnson in next
year’s primaries, and George Wallace,
the former Governor of Alabama, who
is making less and less of a secret of
his intention to run next November as
a third-party “blacklash.”
Some American Liberals are already
screaming in alarm, not so much at
the prospect of George Wallace get-
ting into the White House as at the
price that one or other of the national
parties may have to pay for his assis-
tance in getting their own candidate
in.
If he bring nothing else off, George
Wallace could, according to fears
recently expressed by a prominent New
York Trade Union leader, Gus Tyler,
at least ensure that whatever adminis-
tration takes office in 1969 is firmly
pledged to reactionary and racist
politics.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
The Trade Practices Act requires
commonsense and consultation
The Trade Practices Act is now
a 1: work. By the first of this month
examinable agreements had to be
submitted for registration. But what
does this controversial legislation
do? Last week Sydney solicitor
David Price outlined the new law
to the Australian Institute of Direc-
tors in a clear and straightforward
statement of its requirements and
implications.
UNLESS BASIC COMMONSENSE
prevails on both sides of the fence, this
Act could become a monster. The
purpose of the Act, as stated in the
preamble, is “to preserve competition
in Australian trade and commerce to
the extent required by public interest.”
I mention this because some may feel
that this purpose is not altogether obvi-
ous from the Act itself. Similar over-
seas legislation in the trade practices
field shows that this type of legislation
is general, and we must learn to live
with it. It would, indeed, be foolish
to attempt to ignore it.
But it is obvious that if certain trade
practices were prohibited, instability
and confusion in the market would
result, and in turn customers would
suffer with inferior goods and services.
It is refreshing, therefore, to have the
assurance of the Commissioner, Mr.
R. M. Bannerman, that: “I hope we
will be prepared to test ourselves in
consultation without waiting for litiga-
tion. If we are prepared to do this, I
think we will be acting in the spirit of
this statute ... I do not think the
client’s interest will suffer, and I am
sure public interest will benefit. So far
as I have, as Commissioner, a contri-
bution to make to this, I shall make it
to the best of my ability. I hope the
teachers of industry and commerce will
encourage them to do the same.”
The Act is complex in its scope, and
is hinged in the middle on the discre-
tion of a Commissioner, and in due
course, as in the taxation field, no
doubt more than one Commissioner or
Deputy Commissioner, each applying
his own discretion. Some of you might
well feel that one is entitled to know
with some degree of certainty his legal
position. My personal view is that there
are an unfortunate number of “discre-
tions” creeping into our legislation.
This may be all very well for so long
as we are fortunate enough to have, as
in the past, people of complete and
undoubted integrity making these de-
cisions.
Amongst other obvious dangers, we
get the situation where having discussed
a matter fully with the Commissioner,
he says, “I think this is contrary to
public interest.” You may disagree
violently, but feel, in your case, the
matter is not of sufficient moment to
test at law. It becomes a precedent.
Years later the question is of sufficient
moment for someone to test it and the
decision is reversed. In the meantime,
you have been trading under what is
subsequently shown to be an improper
restriction. This is no reflection on
the ability of the Commissioner
on the contrary, we could not be off
to a better start but is a weakness
inherent in this type of legislation.
Apart from civil remedies, the Act
provides a penalty of fines up to $2OOO
for offences, and in the case of col-
lusive tendering and collusive bidding,
individual fines of up to $4OOO or
imprisonment of up to six months.
The penalty for the Commissioner or
a member of his staff divulging infor-
mation concerning your affairs is pnly
$lOOO or imprisonment for three
months.
Collusive tendering and collusive
bidding are made unlawful and heavy
penalties are provided. “Collusive
tendering agreement” under Section 85
means:
(a) An agreement by two or more per-
sons for the submission of identical
tenders or joint tender for the
supply or acquisition of goods or
services, or
(b) Any other agreement that has the
purpose or effect of preventing
or restricting competition among
all or any of the parties in res-
pect of tendering for the supply
or acquisition of goods or services.
A joint tender is one submitted by
two or more persons with the inten-
tion of sharing, if the tender is success-
ful, the relevant goods or services. It
is a defence if the Court is satis-
fied:
(a) That the agreement concerned was
not made for the purpose of a
particular invitation to tender, and
(b) At the time of the alleged offence:
(i) Full particulars were contained
in the Register of Trade Agree-
ments, and (ii) There was not in
force an order of the Tribunal
that was contravened by the
alleged offence.
Order, incidentally, under the
definition section includes “a refusal
to make an order.”
It is not an offence against the
Section to tender for the supply of
goods for export to a person carry-
ing on business outside Australia or
for the supply of services outside Aus-
tralia. It is also interesting to note
that, in respect of collusive tendering,
no offence is committed unless the
invitation to tender requires tenders to
be submitted in writing, and further
the Act makes it clear that no offence
is committed if the person inviting
tenders consents to the making of a
joint tender.
Section 86 creates the offence of col-
lusive bidding, which consists of a
person bidding or participating in mak-
ing a bid or abstaining from bidding
at an auction, in accordance with a
collusive bidding agreement. Collusive
bidding agreement definition follows
that for the collusive tendering agree-

ment, and similar defences are avail-
able.
Keep in mind the distinction be-
tween vertical or unilateral agreements
and those which are horizontal or
multilateral. Agreements between
manufacturer and wholesaler or dis-
tributor, wholesaler and retailer, re-
tailer and agent, are vertical agree-
ments. Horizontal agreements are those
between retailer and retailer, manu-
facturer and manufacturer, etc.
The sections of the Act relating to
examinable agreements and practices
took effect from September 1, 1967.
Examinable agreements in force on
that date became subject to registra-
tion on October 2, 1967, and
particulars should have been furnished
prior to November 1, 1967, unless
extension of time has been applied
for. Do not assume that unlimited
extensions are easy to come by. The
Commissioner reminds you that the
Act was passed in 1965, and appears to
feel a month is adequate.
All examinable agreements made
after September 1, 1967, must, of
course, be lodged for registration within
30 days. I would stress that if you have
any doubts as to your obligations
under this Act, you should take the
matter up immediately with your
solicitors. The answers may not be
simple. I understand Lord Justice
Danckwerts has said, of an important
aspect of the corresponding English
legislation, “Heaven help the lawyer
who has to advise a client.”
Section 35 of the Act provides that
agreements between competitors con-
taining certain restrictions shall be
subject to examination by the Tri-
bunal in relation to both goods and
services.
Agreements covering: 1, Prices; 2,
Concessions; 3, Market output; 4, Zon-
ing; and 5, Boycotts are examinable.
In general, therefore, only horizontal
agreements are examinable under Sec-
tion 35—in other words, agreements be-
tween persons of the same level in the
distributive process. Vertical agree-
ments, e.g., a price maintenance agree-
ment between a single manufacturer
and his wholesaler, or between the
wholesaler and retailer, will not be
examinable because usually the
businesses of the parties are not com-
petitive.
Under Section 35, businesses are
deemed competitive if they are com-
petitive in relation either to the acquisi-
tion of goods or services or to the
supply of goods or services. Road
hauliers will be in competition both
among themselves and with the Rail-
ways where each offers to carry the
same goods between the same points.
However, questions of degree, of course,
arise. « It would appear that a dry-
cleaning business at Goodooga would
hardly be competitive with a similar
business in Albury. The question may
not be so simple if they are in adjoin-
ing towns or adjoining suburbs.
Agreements between related com-
panies are not examinable. The term
“related corporation” is given the same
meaning as it has under the Uniform
Companies legislation. Accordingly, an
agreement to which the only parties
are a holding company and its sub-
sidiary or two or more subsidiaries of
a common holding Company are not
examinable under the Act.
Section 36 makes certain practices
examinable. These flow from vertical
agreements, i.e., people occupying dif-
ferent levels in productive or distribu-
tive processes. The four practices are:
1, Obtaining discrimination in prices
or terms of dealing; 2, Forcing another
person’s product; 3, Inducing refusal
to deal, and 4, Monopolisation.
The examinable practice of “obtain-
ing discrimination in price or terms of
dealing” is defined in the Act, and
appears to be concerned with the con-
duct by buyers designed to wring out
a price advantage to the detriment of
rivals. For example, take a retail
trader of substantial proportions who
buys goods in large quantities from a
wholesaler. He then says to the whole-
saler, “Unless you are prepared to sell
to me at a lower price than you nor-
mally give to other competitive retail-
ers, I will withhold my business.”
The practice of forcing another per-
son’s product is defined by Section
36(1) (b). The sub-section refers ta
three persons, and by way of illustra-
tion, let us take X, Y, and Z. X will
be engaging in the practice if he re-
quires, as a condition of his supplying
Y with his class of goods or services,
that Y acquire another class of goods
or services from Z.
The practice of inducing refusal to
deal is defined by Section 36(1)(c).
The essence of this practice is to in-
duce or attempt to induce, which must
be by one of the persons within the
definition. The practice would be en-
gaged in, it appears, if the secretary
of a trade association or retailers were
to induce or attempt to induce a whole-
saler not to supply a retailer who was
not a member of the association.
The practice of monopolisation is
defined by Section 37(1):
“A person is engaged in monopolisa-
tion if, being in a dominant position
in the trade in goods of a particular
description, or in the supply of ser-
vices of a particular description, in
Australia or in a part of Australia, he
takes advantage of that position so as
to:
(a) induce or attempt to induce a
person carrying on a business to refuse
to deal with a third person on terms
disadvantageous to the third person; or
(b) engage in price-cutting with the
object of substantially damaging the
business of a competitor or preventing
a possible competitor from entering
into competition with him; or
(c) impose prices or other terms or
conditions of dealing that he would be
unable to impose but for his dominant
position.”
The basic pre-requisite for the prac-
tice is that a person must be in a
“dominant position.” The Act defines
“dominant position” as being that of
a supplier of not less than one-third
by quality or value of the goods (in-
cluding imported goods) or services of
that description in Australia or in that
part of Australia whether by whole-
sale, retail, or otherwise. The Act
elaborates that the Tribunal shall not
How it's done overseas
There is similar legislation on
restrictive trade practices over-
seas. In the United States, the gen-
eral philosophy behind the Anti
Trust Laws (as they are known) is
that in general, all practices restrict-
ing competition are deemed illegal.
The Sherman Act of 1890 declares
certain restrictive practices and at-
tempts at monopolies, whether be-
tween the several States or with
foreign nations, to be illegal . The
penalty is a fine not exceeding
$50,000 or imprisonment not exceed-
ing one year, or both.
The Clayton Act of 1914, which
followed, makes restrictive practices
such as prices discrimination, exclu-
sive dealing, mergers, and certain in-
terlocking company directorates
illegal. Treble damages are provided
' or j r , ,r,
In Lurope, the Treaty of Rome
(Article 85) provides that certain
agreements likely to affect trade be-
tween member States and aimed at
preventing or discouraging compe-
tition within the Common Market
are illegal.
Canada also has laws in respect
of restrictive trade practices. These,
to some extent, follow American
legislation.

regard as part of Australia an area
that does not include the whole of a
State or Territory unless it is satisfied
that it is appropriate to do so having
regard to its size or significance as a
market area.
In considering this Section, one
should also remember that the Act de-
fines person as including a reference to
a combination, so that the “dominant
position” may be that of a person or a
combination of persons.
The Act (Sections 38 and 39)
exempts certain agreements and prac-
tices from its operation, including
those:—
1. Specially authorised by the Act,
a Commonwealth or State Act or
a Territorial Ordinance, relating
to the remuneration, conditions of
employment, hours of work or
working conditions of employees,
2. in respect of standards prepared or
approved by the Standards Associ-
ation of Australia or any pres-
cribed Association or body,
3. protecting the goodwill of a busi-
ness in the case of sale,
4. in respect of licences, patents, regis-
tered designs or copyrights as set
out in the Act.
Now to registration of agreements.
We have already seen certain agree-
ments are examinable. Section 41 pro-
vides that all agreements which are
examinable when made, must be regis-
tered, and any which become examin-
able at any time after they have been
made must also be registered. It
appears there will be one Register only
that will be kept in the main office
of the Commissioner in Canberra.
There will be other offices in each of
the State capital cities, which will give
information about the legislation and
transmit documents lodged there for
registration to Canberra, and having
facilities so that the Commissioner may
operate from the State office when
interviewing.
Examinable agreements, of course,
as we have seen, may relate to the
supply of either goods or services. How-
ever, an examinable agreement relat-
ing exclusively to services is exempt
from registration unless those services
are or include services by way of:
(a) The production, construction,
maintenance, repair, treatment,
processing, cleaning or alteration
of goods or of fixtures on land.
(b) The alteration of the physical
state of the land.
(c) Distribution of goods or the trans-
portation of goods.
It should be noted that no prac-
tices are required to be registered,
even though they may be examinable.
Mergers and take-overs are not
directly controlled by the Act, but they
can be affected if they put a business
in a dominant position, and this could
lead to the practice of monopolisation.
The Act provides for a Commis-
sioner of Trade Practices, who is
charged with registering agreements
submitted to him for this purpose, and
where he is of the opinion that any rele-
vant restriction under the agreement
is contrary to public interest, he alone
may institute proceedings before the
Tribunal under Section 47. The
Attorney-General may also direct the
Commissioner to investigate facts and
circumstances with respect to an
examinable agreement or examinable
practice and report to him.
Section 48 provides that the Com-
missioner shall not institute proceed-
ings under Section 47 unless he has
first carried on consultations with the
persons who would be other parties to
the proceedings with a view to render-
ing proceedings unnecessary. The duty
of the Commissioner to consult with
parties with a view to avoiding pro-
ceedings is, perhaps, one of the more
practical aspects of the Act.
To repeat, we have:
(i) Examinable agreements and
practices.
(ii) A register for examinable
agreements.
(iii) If the Commissioner is of the
view that a restriction under
an examinable agreement is
contrary to public interest, he
then consults with the parties
with a view to avoiding litiga-
tion.
(iv) If consultation leaves the prob-
lem unresolved he may refer
the matter to the Tribunal.
In determining public interest the
Act (Section 50) directs the Tribunal
to take as a basis for consideration the
principle that the preservation and
encouragement of competition are
desirable for the public interest, but
shall weigh against the detriment
caused by any proved restriction or
competition the following matters:
(a) The needs and interests of con-
sumers, employees, producers, dis-
tributors, importers, exporters,
proprietors, and investigators.
(b) The needs and interests of small
businesses.
(c) The promotion of new enterprise.
(d) The need to achieve the full and
efficient use of labor and capital.
(e) The need to achieve full and
efficient use of production and dis-
tribution.
(f) The ability of Australian produc-
ers and exporters to compete in
overseas markets.
These have been referred to as the
trader’s “gateways” through which he
can escape the Act.
The appropriate course for a mem-
ber of the public to take if he con-
siders that an agreement or practice
is contrary to public interest is to
bring details of the agreement or prac-
tice to the notice of the Commissioner.
The Act provides for enforcement pro-
cesses and civil action for damages
although there are constitutional prob-
lems concerned and other limiting
factors which will tend to complicate
and restrict the operation of the Act.

The devaluation
Now what happens to
British “funk money”?
NOW THAT AUSTRALIAN stock-
markets are having to adjust to the
devaluation, the evidence of just how
much' recent British investment in Aus-
tralia had only been “funk money” will
soon begin to show. There seems little
doubt that a large proportion of recent
capital inflow into Australia from
Britain had been aimed more at avoid-
ing the effects of a unilateral British
devaluation that was not followed (at
least all the way) by an Australian
one, than of making genuine invest-
ments here.
It was a remarkable coincidence
that this flood of British funds seeking
protection should have coincided with
our extraordinary nickel, oil, and iron
ore developments and, because so many
of the companies involved were well
known in London (and, more impor-
tant, are traded on the London Stock
Exchange), these became the natural
haven of these funds. This British
money fed the boom. The big ques-
tion is how much of it will be with-
drawn now that everyone knows the
worst.
What this withdrawal will mean to
the stock market is the basic worry of
Australian investors. Of course it
could turn out that many British “funk
money” holders of our boom stocks
have had such a good ride and still
have such- high hopes that they will
remain in their BHPs, WMCs, Great
Boulders, Hamersleys, Goldfields, and
all the rest of them. After all, the
dividends these stocks eventually hand
out when their prospects turn into pay-
ments will be worth more to British
holders than before. But this is not
going to count too much with those in-
vestors who have many other uses for
their money back home.
The facts of the amount of British
“funk money” here are hard to estab-
lish. The latest official figures for the 12
months to June last year show that
despite the U.K. Government’s severe
restrictions on overseas investment, the
flow of British capital into Australia
actually increased by more than 10
percent or $2O million, despite a reduc-
tion of $ll million in the amount of
profit retained by British companies in
Australia. So more than $3O million
more in real cash came into Australia.
And the same thing seems to have hap-
pened in 1966-67, although no figures
are yet available.
But the most striking statistics of all
are those recently issued for the Sep-
tember quarter of this year, which re-
veal a doubling of Australia’s capital
inflow (excluding Government trans-
actions) to $220 million. The figures
don’t show its source, but the evidence
suggests it was largely Britain. A lot
of this looks likely to go back where
it came from, particularly now that you
can earn such high interest on funds
in London. This would have happened
whatever decision Australia had made
about devaluation.
Shipping
Costs revolution
IT IS STAGGERING how inefficient
the shipping business has been; the eco-
nomic cost to Australia in terms of
unnecessarily high freight rates, delivery
delays, and damage brought about by
the shipping industry’s reluctance to
improve its 19th-century techniques
(and 19th-century-styled ships) has
been quite dreadful. But in the past few
years there has been a shipping revolu-
tion that is already having a signifi-
cant impact on the whole industry.
But one of the most significant fea-
tures of all this is that no longer are
labor costs such an important factor in
running an overseas shipping line, as
highly automated ships mean that
labor is only a fraction of running
costs, and that quick turnaround is
the key to profits, as the aim is to keep
the capital invested in a ship moving
as fast as possible. So it means that
high-labor-cost countries like Australia
can sensibly go into overseas shipping.
The recently approved move by the
Australian National Line into the over-
seas shipping business, particularly to
Japan, is well and truly on the way.
This month the Minister for, Shipping
and Transport, Mr. Gordon Freeth, and
the ANL chairman, Captain Sir John
Williams, have been in Japan negotiat-
ing with Japanese shipyards for the
construction of a revolutionary style
ship to service the trade, which it is
hoped to start within two years.
The roll-on system means that these
ships can be loaded and unloaded in
one quarter the normal time and their
operation is highly automated, so that
high wage rates of Australian seamen
would not place too heavy a burden on
operating costs once the ANL used them
in the Northbound service (which will
be in conjunction with the Japanese
Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha line, which is
already a Northbound conference mem-
ber). So far it appears that these new
ANL ships will be built completely in
Japan; nothing has been heard of
earlier suggestions of a joint BHP-
Japanese arrangement for building

THIS IS RIGHT
ANL’s overseas ships, with BHP having
the use of Japanese technology in con-
structing the hulls in Whyalla, while
the Japanese would install the engines
and equipment.
But, in the meantime, another strik-
ing improvement in shipping practices
is taking place in the Australian-
European trade with the introduction
of Scandia-type and W-kerk ships.
Two years ago, before their introduc-
tion, the average time of a round trip
for a conference line ship on the
Britain-to-Australia run was 170 days;
last year it was cut to 162 days; the
Scandia ships operated by Trans-
atlantic S.S. Co. (which is also a
member of the Atlantic consortium
that uses the revolutionary new
Atlantic Span-type vessel) are ex-
pected to cut the trip to 100 days. And
the Holland-Australia’s new W-kerk
vessels are aiming to do it in only 90
days cutting 72 days off the voyage
and allowing the ships to do four
round trips a year instead of the 1965
average of little better than two. The
cost reductions these time savings
bring are significant; they could well
have some impact on freight rates
out of Australia, as no doubt exporting
bodies will seek to share in the sav-
ings. And this time saving has been
despite the Suez closure; the Holland-
Australia line’s Westerkerk should be
finishing her fourth round voyage to
Australia by this time next year, and
that will be including at least one
Mediterranean detour.
The key to “W” operations (and
indeed to all unit-load vessels like
them) is that cargo is unitised on pal-
lets or flats or is pre-slung or in con-
tainers. There are hardly any wharf-
laborers needed and very few of these
are doing any hard manual work. But
the new system has its problems. Unitis-
ing wool, with 54 or 72 bales in one
lift in bundles of six bales tied with
steel straps, is all very well for solving
shipping problems (the bales all re-
main in the net for the trip and are
simply plucked out at the other end
ready-loaded), but these units have to
be split up for different destinations on
arrival in Europe. At present things
are not working too well at that end:
almost every week up to 50 bales of
wool are wandering around northern
European ports looking for their home.
The economy
Overcoming slack
AMID THE NOISE of brokers bid-
ding for mineral shares and politicians
for votes, a most important piece of
economic news went almost unheard
last week. This was a sign that the
economy has come through its pro-
longed slack and is heading for more
buoyant times. The figures for unem-
ployment dropped dramatically between
September and October, from 68,000 to
64,000, and this followed a substantial
fall from August. The only reservation
which must be made is that there is
no corresponding rise in the number of
job vacancies. But those can be con-
fidently expected to follow.
For a good time now it has looked
as though the general pace of economic
activity should be rising. After all,
retail sales have been good and two
vital industries, motor vehicles and
house-building, have been almost as
active as in periods of record boom.
Industrial production indexes headed
up nicely. Yet apparently inexplicably,
unemployment continued to rise and
the labor market got easier and easier.
We have the answer now. It must
simply have been a delayed reaction
on the part of employers to the increase
in work to be done. Perhaps it is an
indication of the fact that for two years
employers have been retaining on their
payrolls more workers than they could
fully employ; they have been hoarding
labor, to use the vogue phrase.
In any case it looks as though the
Budget has done what was required
and provided the slight boost the
economy needed. Looking ahead, the
only setback is in the drought-affected
rural sector, with the wheat harvest cut
to 60 percent of last year’s figure.
Things look grim, too, for the sheep of
western Victoria and South Australia;
it is impossible to be anything but pessi-
mistic about next year’s wool cheque.
Offsetting these disappointments are
the excitements of the minerals boom.
If, as BHP says, we shall be 25 per-
cent self-sufficient in petroleum by 1970,
then we should be able to look forward
in a speculative sort of way to being
able to supply half our needs by the
mid-19705, and being fully self-sufficient
by the end of the decade. That would
save us something of the order of
s4oom. of foreign exchange.
New Zealand
Grim business
ECONOMIC PROSPECTS across the
Tasman look grimmer than ever. A
quarterly survey by the New Zealand
Institute of Economic Research des-
cribes the three months ended Septem-
ber as very bad for business, the worst
since surveys began in 1961. All con-
sumer goods industries reported pro-
duction down; indeed, every industry
except printing and packaging re-
ported output down.
A majority of businessmen expect
conditions to deteriorate further in the
months ahead. Stocks appear to be
increasing and the vast majority intend
to reduce capital spending over the
next twelve months. At the same time,
prices and costs continue to rise.
Motor-car assembly plants are par-
ticularly hard hit, a major firm re-
porting turnover down 50 percent. No
workers have been laid off, but over-
time has been completely eliminated.
A “deeply pessimistic outlook” is re-
ported by* architects for the building
industry. But the Institute is at least
reassuring in finding that industry
cannot get much more pessimistic.

Ornamesh. We’ve seen it used
in solar screens, room dividers,
car sun visors, TV grilles, safety

grasscatchers, ironing boards
and 1,000 other ways. But we’re
glad to say we were wrong. The
planners of the new toll section
of the Pacific Highway dis-
covered a most imaginative use
for Ornamesh—as anti-dazzle

cause only Ornamesh has the
combination of qualities needed.
It’s steel-strong. Rigid. Light-

THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: October’s employment statistics
further confirmed previous monthly trends; seasonally
adjusted, unemployed registrants dropped back 3785 to
64,246, while job vacancies were 2259 fewer at 33,149.
Registrations of new motor vehicles in October, 38,371,
were the second highest ever recorded (the best, August
1965’s 39,881).
Trading bank advances for October went up a seasonally
adjusted $55.9 million, against $37.6 million for September
and $25.3 million for August; deposits rose by $39.1 mil-
lion ($22.7 million in September and $40.5 million in
August).
Australia’s international reserves added $27.6 million in
October, to reach $1170.4 million; they totalled $1289.8
million in October, 1966.
Proceeds from wool for the four months to October
were $183.5 million, compared with $208.6m in the cor-
responding 1966 period.
For the markets: A broad swathe of individual gains
saw both industrials and miners move strongly ahead on
Australian share markets.
Some rather confused dealing struck London equities
as sterling came under pressure . . . Better economic
news pushed Wall Street along in active trading.
For companies: History was made when Burns Philp
put out its first preliminary report and this indicated an
almost steady net profit, at $3,942,410, for 1966-67; the
previous profit, $5,093,487, covered 15 months trading.
Directors are to undertake a complete reappraisal of ship-
ping activities, which again produced losses . . . Colonial
Sugar Refining is to hold its percent dividend rate by
a 6J percent interim . . . Incidentally, Pioneer Sugar Mills
gave notice of a good year, expressing better hopes for all
milling companies ... On the sweet side, Mars Inc. (of
U.S.A.) has made a cash purchase of Master Foods Hold-
ings Pty., maker and supplier of specialist food.
Returning to the usual mining eminences, Peko-Wallsend
so far claims a 30 percent (capital) acceptance from Mount
Morgan ... A 4 percent lift for Coal and Allied Indus-
tries brought earnings to $3,702,761 and shareholders were
paid a post-bonus 7 percent, equivalent to 14 percent pre-
bonus . . . Bellambi Coal (partly owned by CGA) has
improved and extended contracts with the Japanese steel
mills . . . Less iron and steel were produced by BHP
in October as a result of a blast-furnace close-down.
Which leads directly to BHP-Esso, who have decided
jointly (under a separate company) to market natural gas
from Barracouta to industry; Gippsland’s offshore wildcat
Dolphin oil well turns out to be non-commercial “at this
stage,” as does the Crayfish A-l gas.
No final preference payment will arrive from engineer
A. G. Healing, for the first time in 39 years; the latest
loss, $1,196,459, compares with 1965-66’s $1,104,131, while
directors expect a “greatly reduced” loss for the current
year.
Quarrier, concrete supplier, and brick maker Blue Metal
Industries sounds very hopeful about 1967-68, based on
returns from its first quarter . . . Sawmiller and timber
merchant Kauri has turned a $49,231 loss into a $162,994
profit . . . Hardwood timber chips from Eden (N.S.W.)
will be imported to Japan under a venture between Harris
Holdings (51 percent) and Daishowa .Paper Manufacturing
Co.
Higher tax did not prevent Australian Fertilizers from
holding profits at $1,223,422 (previously $1,292,016); 8
percent is paid on a 13.6 percent earning rate.
Television Corporation went up 30 percent to $1,161,410,
well covering the 20 percent dividend.
MEN AND MATTERS
ONE OF THE LOCAL boys making
really good out of Western Australia’s
rapid development is genial 41-year-
old Perth engineer Harold Clough, a
man whose easygoing appearance has
not dented his business skills. Taking
■over his father’s civil engineering firm,
J. O. Clough & Son Ltd., in 1954,
Harold has built its annual turnover
up from about $lOO,OOO to more than
$4 million. He did not start out with
the intention of taking over from his
father; he was training to be a manage-
ment consultant with W. D. Scott be-
fore winning a 1951 Fulbright scholar-
ship to the University of California.
There he completed his Master of
Science in engineering and worked with
the Bechtel Corporation for a couple
of years before coming back home to
head the family business.
Now Harold Clough is leading his
company into a new field, having won
the $1.3 million contract to build Mt.
Newman’s powerhouses at Port Hed-
land and at the mine-site. Previously
only in civil engineering, this move into
electrical and mechanical engineering
is another milestone for the company.
J. O. Clough and Son Ltd. had their
first real breakthrough when they won
the Perth’s Narrows Bridge contract in
joint venture with an overseas firm.
They weathered the killing slump of
the early 1960 s by refusing to tender
precariously, and have emerged as the
West’s major engineers as a result.
They have won key contracts on the
Ord, at North-West Cape, and on the
Mitchell Freeway project, which is
carving up the western end of Perth.
And they joined with Koppers in doing
the second stage of the giant North-
West Cape U.S. radio project.
Despite the magnitude of the present
Mt. Newman job, it means that 5
Clough’s have actually diminished their
total commitment. Meanwhile, an-
other diversion is under way—into min-
ing although Harold Clough insists
that at this stage the formalities of
seeking iron ore and base metals tene-
ments are “strictly preliminaries.”
APPOINTMENT OF THE former
general manager and a director of Aus-
tralian Fertilizers, John G. Schroder,
to Continental Oil Co. of Australia
(Conaus) as vice-president directing
operations of the plant foods division,
has revived speculation about Con-
tinental’s possible entry to the fertiliser
field. Already Continental is heavily
involved in agricultural chemicals
through its majority holding in the un-
impressive Amalgamated Chemicals
J. G. Schroder
Harold Clough
company, and is spending a lot of
money on an intensive search for phos-
phate rock in eastern Australia (it has
some fairly interesting areas).
John Schroder, ex-airforce bomber
command, graduated from Sydney Uni-
versity as a chemical engineer on a
CRTS scholarship in 1949 and joined
ICI at Billingham in England, where
he worked for four years in the syn-
thetic oil section. He came back to
Australia as chief engineer of Australian
Fertilizers, in which ICIANZ have a
53 percent shareholding, and became
general manager in 1961. With big
things happening in the ICIANZ fer-
tiliser field as Eastern Nitrogen gets
under way, Schroder’s move to Con-
tinental is really intriguing.


COMPANY MEETING
HIGHLIGHTS OF CHAIRMAN’S ADDRESS
Broken Hill South Limited
360 Collins Street, Melbourne, Australia, 3000
The Chairman of Broken Hill South Limited, Mr. G. Lindesay Clark, in
his address to stockholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting
on Friday, 10th November, 1967, said:
Mr. G. Lindesay Clark
FINANCIAL
The consolidated net profit of the Broken
Hill South Limited group of companies
was $2,612,000 and the net profit of the
parent company was $2,584,000. The net
profit was $610,000 lower than in 1966 in
the consolidated figures, and $776,000
lower for the parent company.
The two principal factors responsible for
the lower net profit results were reduced
earnings from the South Mine, Broken
Hill, due almost entirely to lower metal
prices received, and the fall in the net
profit of The Electrolytic Refining and
Smelting Company of Australia Limited.
By comparison with a net loss in 1966, its
first year of operations, Cobar Mines Pro-
prietary Limited achieved a net profit.
A dividend of 5 cents per stock unit has
been declared and is due for payment on
Ist December, 1967.
FUNDS FOR CAPITAL WORKS
Although 1967 saw a reduced rate of ex-
penditure on capital works by comparison
with recent years, the fall in revenue from
mine production forestalled any improve-
ment in the Company’s liquid position.
The Company is involved in a growing
expenditure commitment in respect of its
phosphate discoveries in Queensland, and
other prospects may, depending upon re-
sults, call for larger expenditure in the
ensuing year. For the time being it is in-
tended to continue with short-term bor-
rowing and bank overdraft as sources of
finance, but Directors will have under re-
view the longer term position in the light
of expenditure commitments.
OPERATIONS AT BROKEN HILL
The chief point of interest in the South
Mine is that ore reserves have been main-
tained at 850,000 tons or 50,000 tons be-
low last year’s level, notwithstanding pro-
duction of 222,000 tons during the year.
Additions to geological data at Broken
Hill have led to improved interpretations
of the structures of the field, and pros-
pecting has been renewed nearer to the
southern end of the Broken Hill mines.
MINERAL EXPLORATION
At Chillagoe in Queensland, a number of
out-crops and consistent presence .of
metals in the oxidised zone warrant sus-
tained efforts to test primary ore and drill-
ing is being continued. Sulphide minerali-
sation has so far been encountered only in
one drill hole and assayed 4.9% lead, 6.5
ozs. silver/ton, 11.3% zinc and 0.8% cop-
per over 23 feet width.
In the Lake Torrens area, South Australia,
extensive surface reconnaissance has indi-
cated a long series of geochemical ano-
malies in a favourable geological environ-
ment. The area seems sufficiently favour-
able to warrant sustained exploration.
PHOSPHATE RESERVES,
QUEENSLAND
Broken Hill South Limited, during the
year, has confirmed the grade and great
size of its Queensland phosphate deposits.
At Duchess, having established the depth
distribution of the phosphorite horizons,
drilling has been concentrated on three
main areas extending over 13 miles length
to prove in detail the first few hundred
million tons of surface and near-surface
material. Drilling results in these three
zones show a thickness of beds of, respec-
tively, 63 feet at 22 Vi% Or, at Rimmer
Hill, 32 feet at 19% at Mt. Murray and
29 feet at 21 % at Phosphate Hill.
Phosphate beds also outcrop at various
places over a length of 130 miles com-
mencing 175 miles NNW of the Duchess
deposits. Much of the outcrop is within
the Authorities to Prospect granted to
Broken Hill South Limited. By drilling in
these areas, five new phosphorite locations
have been disclosed, of which the most
important appears to be the Lady Annie
deposit. Mineralogically, the phosphate
resembles the Duchess deposits. Assays
available to date average 20.5% P 2 Or,
over a depth of 21 feet. These deposits
are close to the trial survey of the rail-
way from the Duchess to deep water on
the Gulf of Carpentaria. Their discovery,
in which the quantities already disclosed
are significant, should facilitate the estab-
lishment of the whole mining project. The
project is essentially a long-term one and
the many alternatives for exploitation of
the deposits are receiving consideration.
The project is also one which will need
the continuing support and assistance of
both Federal and State Governments and
we greatly appreciate their keen interest
in our efforts.
BEACH PETROLEUM N.L.
Beach Petroleum N.L. has commenced
marine seismic investigations in St. Vin-
cent Gulf, South Australia. It also holds
a 50% interest in the Hundred of Mayurra
area, in the south east of South Australia,
where results of wells being drilled in the
vicinity by ESSO-BHP and Shell could
have significant bearing on the prospects
of the area held by Beach Petroleum N.L.
In the southern Cook Strait area in New
Zealand, where Beach Petroleum N.L. has
a 50% interest in tenements, several major
anticlines have been located in deep Ter-
tiary continental shelf section. Negotia-
tions are proceeding for a farm-out of the
licences.
C.S.A. MINE, COBAR
Ore production at the C.S.A. Mine, Cobar,
is gradually increasing and is expected to
reach 60,000 tons per month in 1968.
The discovery of copper-zinc ore-bodies
between the two main copper loads, whilst
materially increasing ore potential, has
necessitated a large increase in the
development programme. The combined
ore potential of the C.S.A. and Chesney
mines, reported last year at 27 million
tons, remains unchanged except for ore
mined during the year.
Exploratory drilling at the Queen Bee
mine in the southern end of the field has
intersected copper ore assaying 2.9% cop-
per over a true width of approximately
34 feet at a depth of 1300 feet.
THE ELECTROLYTIC REFINING
AND SMELTING COMPANY OF
AUSTRALIA LIMITED
The commissioning of a new shaft furnace
at Port Kembla this month will expand
the capacity of E.R. & S. to cast special
copper shapes and represents a conclud-
ing stage in the long-term plan of rebuild-
ing the refinery.
ALCOA OF AUSTRALIA
PROPRIETARY LIMITED
The development of Alcoa of Australia
Proprietary Limited as a fully integrated
aluminium producer and manufacturer,
made excellent progress during the year
and it is now operating profitably.
The capacity of the alumina refinery at
Kwinana will be lifted to 620,000 metric
tons by the third quarter of 1968, and to
830,000 metric tons in the second half of
1969. Bauxite reserves are 500 million
tons. The whole of the alumina output for
the expanded requirement, over and above
the 80,000 tons per annum required for
Point Henry smelter, is already sold under
commercial long-term contract.
THE BROKEN HILL ASSOCIATED
SMELTERS PTY. LTD.
Construction of the new plant for recovery
of zinc from blast furnace slag, including
the existing large slag dump, will be com-
pleted this month, and zinc production
commenced. The production of zinc will
provide B.H.A.S. with a new source of
income, additional to its existing opera-
tions of lead smelting at Port Pirie and
coal mining in New South Wales.
REVIEW
In conclusion the Chairman reviewed the
progress made by Broken Hill South
Limited, since it commenced mining
operations at Broken Hill 82 years ago, to
its present status of a non-ferrous mining
group whose interests now extended to
smelting and refining and, in lesser de-
gree, into metal manufacture. The experi-
ence of the Company’s staff in the finding
and operation of mines, together with the
various assets o 1 ’ the Company, form a
strong base from which to develop the
Company’s phosphate deposits and any
other discoveries which may be made.
The Broken Hill South Limited group of companies include: Cobar Mines Proprietary Limited • Mines Exploration Proprietary
Limited • The Electrolytic Refining and Smelting Company of Australia Limited

A beautiful year
and it's still
going very strong
ONLY 23 SHARE SHOPPING days to
Christmas and the end of a calendar
year which has been one of the greatest
boom years ever enjoyed in the history
of the Exchange. Who would have ever
picked it a year ago? It hardly seemed
likely. Right through 1966 the index
slumbered and, although economically
things were expected to pick up in
1967, no one anticipated much more
than a general improvement. Then it
started. Probably the Goldfields float
and the profit the stags made from it
was the beginning. Then came
Hamersley and more profits and the
beginning of a mini-boom. By this
time both local and overseas investors
had started to sit up and take notice.
Soon after this, the mini-boom de-
veloped into a midi-boom as people
started making profits on such stocks
as BHP and Western Mining.
This was it. People rushed in to
share in the bonanza. To help things
along, mining companies kept on re-
porting new and better discoveries and
before long we had a maxi-boom. At
this stage almost everyone jumped in
to try his luck and most everyone,
except one or two now well-known
brokers, was in fact lucky (and I use
this word advisedly) and made cham-
pagne money for Christmas. Not only
did Australians make money out of the
boom but so also did our buddies in
America and our friends in Europe. The
whole thing can be seen quite clearly
by looking at the index figures. The
Sydney Stock Exchange index has risen
over 30 percent this year and the base
metals sector has gone up over 50 per-
cent, while even that blue chip of all
blue chips, BHP, has gone up close to
300 percent since January 1. So all in
all 1967 has been a beauty and the best
thing is that it is still going . . .
One company that isn’t sharing in
the price boom as much as it should is
Treloar Enterprises, the engineering and
foundry people of Sydney, Melbourne,
and Brisbane. Here’s what happened.
The company listed in 1963 and quickly
became everyone’s darling, with earn-
ing rates of 28.4 percent and 31.6 per-
cent in 1964 and 1965 respectively.
Then came 1965-66. The company’s
profit dropped 16.5 percent and the
market’s enthusiasm for the stock sud-
denly waned and turned to scorn. The
shares, which had been as high as $1.99
in 1965, were marked down to 80
cents in 1966 and then further de-
graded to a mere 68 cents in early 1967.
Now, however, after an improved
result in 1966-67 the market is gradu-
ally beginning to forgive and forget
and the stock has been pardoned to
the extent that its price has been able
to rise up to $1.05. The road to for-
giveness and better prices was probably
helped along its way by the com-
pany’s acting chairman, Mr. J. F. Tre-
loar. He told shareholders at the annual
meeting that if the present sales trend
continues the company will up its divi-
dend from ten percent to percent
and will possibly make a new share
issue. For further encouragement he
mentioned that sales for the first quarter
of 1967-68 were ahead of last year’s
to the tune of 8 percent. Incidentally,
you might be interested to know that
Treloar makes and markets those “Fill-
o-matic” nozzles for petrol pumps
which you see around service stations
nowadays. These gadgets allow the
garagemen to wash your windscreen
and check your tyres at the same
time as he shoves a tiger in your tank.
I don’t know if it was the excite-
ment of making over a $lOOO profit
last week or whether it’s senility creep-
ing on, but having talked about what
a great buy James Wallace was and
how I was buying some, I didn’t.
Working on the basis of better late
than never, I’ve now moved in and
bought 500. Luckily enough the week’s
delay saved me three cents a share.
This week I got them at 40 cents,
whereas last week they were 43 cents.
Being rather rich this week, I decided
to put some of my money into BHP
for safe keeping over the Christmas
period. It may as well be at least in
the market rather than just sitting
idle looking at itself.
Sales this week were T. C. Whittle
at a loss of $l2 and Pioneer Concrete
rights at a profit of $7B.

By JASON
BHP TO BE WELL OVER $2O within
six months? There is a lot of money
that says so. The temporary downturn
in BHP share prices when its Crayfish
offshore gas was reported last week to
have no commercial potential certainly
gives it a very strong-looking market
position, and the chartists still like it,
even though there has been some
switching by profit-takers out of BHP
into Western Mining in recent weeks.
And turnovers in BHP have continued;
last week 215,000 BHP shares . were
traded on the Sydney market alone
and even more were reported in Mel-
bourne, indicating a possible turnover
in BHP shares Australia-wide of about
half a million shares, worth something
like million. This is big business
and buyers, many of them from over-
seas, are taking them in big lumps.
Of course there are a lot of small
shareholders getting in on the act,
too. But the realities seem to be that
most of the interest in BHP is hefty
and well-informed. And this seems to
be confirmed by remarkable buying of
stock options in BHP.
For Australia’s biggest stock option
deal is now under way. In the nine
days, from Melbourne Cup Day, Tues-
day, November 7, to last weekend, more
than 31,000 six - month - call options
were taken out on BHP and they
all had the mark of one operator. This
deal means that some investor is pre-
pared to put up more than $75,000 to
say that BHP shares will reach at least
$2l within the next six months; and
no doubt he expects them to be a lot
more than that if he is to make any
sort of reasonable return on his money.
There are other possibile explana-
tions why an investor should risk such
a huge sum on BHP rising by at least
a further in the next six months; he
may already have taken his profits from
a large holding in the stock and is
prepared to risk some of them to in-
sure himself against any further rises.
But it seems more likely that this is a
straightforward deal by someone who
not only says BHP will go over $2l but
is also prepared to put his money,
$75,000 of it, where his mouth is. This
deal is far more striking than the big
unsuccessful “put” option campaign
against MLC carried on some years
ago by a Melbourne businessman.
But BHP is not the only stock re-
ceiving attention in the options market
(as the stock-options people at last are
getting the sort of business they had
hoped for when they set up shop, but
never got it and as a result of which
several went to the w r all). Last week,
Great Boulder Gold Mines, which the
Chartist recommends on this page,
was the centre of quite a flurry in op-
tions, with almost 6000 three-month
“calls” being taken out, costing about
$12,000. The shares must rise above
their October peak of $14.50 before
most of these begin to pay off, and
there are plenty of “inside” reports
that this will happen (along with a
strong rumor that an excellent report
on November 29 will be followed by a
new issue with the remarkably high
premium of $lO a share).
In the midst of all these calls there
w r as one solitary “put” on Great Boul-
der (there are few “puts” seen these
days in the market’s present mood,
although Mt. Isa and Oil Search also
appeared last week). But there was a
good reason for the Great Boulder
“put,” and there have been several like
it in recent weeks. One sensible ap-
proach to the speculative situation in
Great Boulder, whose shares recovered
$1.90 last week to around $12.40, or
$l.lO below the peak of a few weeks
ago, is to buy the shares and at the
same time get a three-month “put”
option on the same number. This pro-
vides a useful insurance against serious
loss, even though it also means that the
price of Great Boulder must move at
least $2 either way before an investor
begins to make money. Given the way
this stock has moved in the past three
months, this sort of variation seems a
certainty. Stock options are most use-
ful in this sort of situation.
With this interest in Great Boulder-
it is natural that Loloma, which holds
725,000 of its shares, should also have
The Chartist says:
Nickel is the “magic” word on the stockmarket at present and GREAT
BOULDER GOLD MINES is presented this week to illustrate a stock which
has already been an outstanding trendline performer in the technical sense and
would have been given about the $1.90 level. Prices settled into a strong down-
ward trend with recessive tendencies and a low point of 40c was finally recorded
before the dramatic reversal where prices rose to a high of $4.60 in June of this
year. The steep uptrend broke and a reaction back to the support level around
$2.00 followed, but a steeper upward rise continued on very high volume to achieve
a high of $14.50 already. The current technical position of the stock is extremely
strong; once prices move above the resistance level now formed at $14.50, the
probability of a move to $24.00 would then have to be considered. The trend rates
compared with the growth key show a really remarkable rate of appreciation. Last
sale price on 14/11/67 —$11.50.


• . . . r ill-
"its
price to rise to' $5.40 within three
months. Broken Hill South has also
come in for Quite a hit of attention in
the options market with 1500 calls
taken out last week.’ Others prominent
in the lists were Hill 50 with 20,000
calls (16,000 of them for six months),
costing about $3OOO and indicating that
someone expects the shares of this vola-
tile performer to go at least as high
as 90 cents (even if, as is usual with
Hill 50 movements, it is only for a
short time).
Other stocks in which the options
post is reflecting the speculative in-
terest being shown on the trading
boards last week were Hamersley in
which a “double” was taken out as
well as calls in the expectation that its
price would rise in three months to
well over $10; Thiess, which is ex-
pected to rise to better than $4.50 (and
it has almost happened already); CRA,
EZI, Ampol Exploration, Associated
Freney, Consolidated Rutile* Cudgen,
Mid-Eastern, Planet Oil (which also
appeared in the “put” list, along with
Planet Metals), Metals Exploration,
AOD, ODE, AOG (whose offshore
Queensland drill is now going down),
Beach Petroleum, Interstate, Long-
reach, Papuan Apinaipi, and even
Silver Valley Uranium (the epitome
°f r^e boom-time stock).

EVEN SUGAR STOCKS, not the most
option-prone buoyant-looking shares of
recent times, have been making their
reappearance in the options lists. Last
week both Millaquin and Pioneer were
bought, with Millaquin expected by one
buy er to rise from last week’s $3.10 to
at least $ 3 - 55 Wlthin three months and

wIU g° U P from $ 2 - 13 t 0 more than
$ 2 - 50 - These deals followed Friday’s
report from Pioneer Sugar which indi-
cated that the sugar industry could
show another profit recovery for 1967.
The company based its optimism on
the added governmental loans to the
industry and last June’s 15 percent
higher domestic sugar price, which will
have its full impact in 1968. But in
Pioneer’s case it is clear that its “good
year” (the company balances in De-
cember) will be helped along consid-
erably by its chemical and pastoral
interests, even though Queensland Har-
vesting, in which it has a stake, again
suffered a loss.
Pioneer’s chairman, Mr. R. R. Rus-
sell, said in his report last week that
f ll sugar-miffing companies are slightly

forecast that a new International Sugar
Agreement could be negotiated next
year but the way things are at pre-

thinking. For even though world sugar

Esanda Limited
365 George Street, Sydney
has pastoral interests, is about in the
middle at $1.30 between its high point
for the year of $1.56 and its low of
$1.12. There is no doubt that unless
something can be done about long-term
prices, this N still a very risky business
to be in.
However, the almost doubling in
price of Australia’s leading sugar stock,
CSR, so far this year has very little to
do with the improved immediate situ-
ation for sugar; latest prices around
$5.40 (up from $2.78 earlier in the
year) reflect the company’s iron - ore
interests far more than its sugar ones.
Even if $1 of this rise (a generous esti-
mate) were accountable to sugar and
chemicals and building materials (all of
which are improving), the remaining
$1.60 rise would mean that the market
thinks CSR’s stake in Mt. Newman is
worth about $lOO million (this would
imply something like double that to
BHP, which has a 30 percent interest
in Mt. Newman). In any event, CSR
also appeared on the options list last
week as someone expects the stock to
reach at least over the $6 mark within
six months.
LAST WEEK WAS a disappointing
one for Sydney timber merchant and
miller Duncan’s Holdings Ltd. This
company spent a long time in creating
the circumstances for a new industry
of wood-chip exporting. But follow-
ing a decision of the N.S.W. Govern-
ment, it will not be able to implement
its plans, for the rights to take timber
from State forests in the Eden district
have been granted to Harris Holdings
Ltd., in partnership with the Japanese
firm Daishowa Paper Manufacturing
Co. Duncan’s had been trying to sell
wood waste for the last decade, but
could not get orders from Japan.
Eventually it interested Mitsui of
Japan and APM to take equal interests
in a consortium, and applied to the
N.S.W. Commissioner of Forests for
the licence.
Harris admits to an active interest
in this arena since only early February
of this year, so no wonder Duncan
feels pipped in the chip business. The
stockmarket did not rate Harris’
chances of getting the licence very
highly. Until the day before the news,
when one investor paid 45c for a small
parcel, prospective buyers were pre-
pared to offer no more than 38c for
the 50c shares (although sellers were
scarce).
Harris’ submission may have been
more detailed than Duncan’s, but it
seems possible that the N.S.W. Gov-
ernment was influenced by the fact
that the Victorian-based APM already
is heavily committed in pulp and
paper. But APM did pioneer the pro-
duction of paper pulp from hard-
woods, and its technical skills are un-
questionable. Japan already imports
from North America vast quantities of
softwood chips or pulp made for
papermaking, but this will be pioneer-
ing in hardwood chips.
The scale of the new business is well
beyond that of Harris’ present size (as
it would have been for Duncan’s, too),
for in two poor years it has earned a
total of only $32,000 on capital of
$719,000. Harris will have to raise 51
percent of the s3m. working capital
necessary to set up the logging, chip-
ping, and transport of the chips to
Japan for the making of paper and
paperboard. Logging will start next
July, and in the meantime, wharves
and dolphins and loading facilities will
be required in Eden. Harris will be
looking for loan moneys in Australia
and overseas. An equity issue was con-
sidered unlikely, but as the shares
soared to 65c on the day following the
announcement, the raising of share
capital may be easier than thought,
Within 1\ years Harris-Daishowa
must establish a s2sm. wood-pulp mill
at Twofold Bay to convert the chips
to pulp for export. Other parties in
Australia could be invited into this
venture, but it’s on the cards these will
not include APM.


Security analyst’s six “finance” stocks
Elders GM and Burns Philp
now underpriced
WHEN I STARTED this series of
articles on the “finance” companies,
comprising six stocks, about seven weeks
ago, I did not expect that there would
be much movement in the share prices.
This expectation was qualified to some
extent by the possibility that the
drought in Victoria could worsen and
that this would depress the price of
Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort’s shares
even though the profitability of that
company would not be overly affected.
It is now apparent that this has
occurred aided to some extent by
fairly bearish Press reports of the chair-
man’s address.
The schedule shows the prices of the
shares in the respective companies as
at September 30 and at the present
time, with the increases and decreases
in absolute terms and in percentage
terms:
Price iP-rice Per-
_ _ at at Inc. cent-
Company sep. 30 Nov. 10 (Deer.) age
5 5 c
Bank of N.'S.W. 5 92 6 38 46 7 8
National- Bank 2.64 3.15 51 19 3
HAiC Holdings 1 03 '1 00 (3) (2 9)
Elders >GIM 2 60 2 23 (37) -(H4 2)
Burns PH'.ip 3 95 4 02 7 1 8
W. R. 'Carpenter 1.99 2.15 16 7.4
From this schedule it can be seen
that four of the six stocks have im-
proved in price. It can be calculated
that if an equal amount of money had
been invested in each of these stocks,,
the total portfolio would have increased
in value by 3.2 percent during the six-
week period. Although this would have
represented an annual rate of increase
of nearly 26 percent, it would not
have been enough to cover brokerage
both ways on the total transactions of
both buying and selling. Judged in
comparison with the fast-moving min-
ing market, capital gains are not likely
to be of a high order in this particular
group of companies, but it is doubtful
whether the group would be considered
today other than as “safe” or “defen-
sive” investments. It then depends how
mych should be paid for safety.
The increases in the prices of the
two banks’ shares could perhaps make
one wonder whether the thinking about
bank shares should not be revised.
There is no doubt that both the Wales
and the National recorded very good
increases in profits during 1966/7. The
pre-tax profit of the Bank of New South
Wales increased by 21 percent and the
after-tax profit by 23 percent. These
are good percentage increases by most
standards and probably reflect the buoy-
ant conditions which have existed for
the past six months at least. Judging
by the preliminary final report, per
share earnings have increased to about
40.6 cents per share, so at $6.38 the
shares are selling at 15.7 times earnings.
There is no doubt that the growth rate
in earnings per share adjusted for new
issues has been quite attractive over the
past five years, for the annual average
rate of increase has been about just
under 8 percent compound.
On the basis of the preliminary
profit announcement, the National Bank
has had an even greater increase in
profit during 1966/7. Disclosed net
profit exceeded $4.6 million and, there-
fore, was more than 39 percent greater
than the 1965/6 figure. The per
share earnings figure shows a substan-
tial increase to 18.3 cents per share,
but even so the shares now seem to be
selling at about 17.2 times latest earn-
ings. In terms of growth per annum,
the National Bank’s record is rather
more erratic than that of the Bank of
New South Wales, yet, on the face of
it, the higher price/earnings multiple
would seem to be justified.
Having regard to the results just
announced, it must be said that both
banks approached the question of what
should be said in their interim (half-
yearly) reports with more than con-
siderable caution. The Wales’ report
suggested that “the estimated results for
the half-year ending 31-3-1967 indicated
a favorable trend in profits” (this re-
port was issued on March 10, 1967).
The National report “anticipated that
profit for the year to September 30,
1967, will be above the result for the
previous twelve months.”
The price of lAC Holdings shares
has not varied materially and, to my
knowledge, there have not been any
developments which might have been
expected to affect the price of the
shares. In the absence of any special
developments, I still think that, around
$l.OO, the shares are quite attractive.
By the time the article on Elders
CM was written the price of the shares
had already receded to $2.25, so a
further fall of 2 cents is not perhaps
very material. The dividend yield is
now 4.9 percent and the price/earn-
ings multiple is a low 7 times. Cer-
tainly, the drought in Victoria must
affect the results for 1967/8 unless
some worthwhile rain occurs before
Christmas. Even if this should occur,
it is doubtful whether the rain will be
in time to make any real change in
the picture as can be seen at the present
time.
I do not know the seriousness of the
Victorian drought, but I do recall the
New South Wales and Queensland
droughts of 1965/6. At that time the
“doom mongers” were predicting
various dire results for the pastoral in-
dustry generally and Elders GM’s fell
to $1.97 in the latter part of 1965.
On this occasion, the chairman has
decided to make an “official” state-
ment in the course of his address to
the annual general meeting and
what better place to make such a
statement. The words which have prob-
ably made the most impact appear at
the bottom of page 2 of the printed
address: “. . . on present indications,
we would be more than optimistic if
we were to predict that the current
financial year could approach the ex-
cellent result of 1966/7.”
I think that it is worth pointing out
to those who like to take a longer
view that, in 1965/6, per share earn-
ings were 26.2 cents on adjusted basis
and that average for the three years
to June 30, 1966, was 26.6 cents. I
would have thought that it would have
been conservative to assume that earn-
ings per share in 1967/8 would be
27 cents per share and that, similarly,
a price of $2.70 would have been a
very realistic one.
The annual reports of Burns Philp
and W. R. Carpenter are expected
almost any day now and it will be
interesting to see what they disclose
on this particular occasion. Particu-
larly, it will be interesting to see
whether the profit of Burns Philp has
followed the trend of W. R. Carpen-
ter or whether the upward trend of
the past few years has been main-
tained.
It may be an advantage to look at
the trends in adjusted earnings per
share for the past five years for the
six companies:
Year ended in 1963 1964 1965 1966 1967
B’an'k of N.'S.W. 33.6 36 8 35.2 37.8 48.6

Elders GM 18.6 25.9 27.6 26 2 31.9
Burns Philp 20.4 23.5 26 4 31.0 n.y.a.
W. R. -Carpenter 11.9 13.5 15.7 16.2 15.9
In index form the trends may be
more apparent:
Bank of N.-S.'W. 100 110 105 1113 ’ 120.
National Bank 100 ,113 97 119 168
lAC Holdings 100 99 104 115 n.y.a.

Burns Phi'lp 100 115 129 05(2 n.y.a.
W. R. Carpenter 100 113 132 136 134
It would seem that the only com-
pany whose shares have really suffered
a marked fall in favor in terms of the
price/earnings multiple is Elders GM.
Carpenter’s shares are still selling at
times the reduced 1966/7 earn-
ings, and while (subject to the Burns
Philp result) this is the lowest multiple
with the exception of lAC, it does seem
like an appropriate one for the group
as a whole.
Elders GM’s and Burns Philp’s shares
are probably the only ones in this group
which are underpriced at the present
time.


The Chartist suggests
Banks for growth,
and IAC perhaps
BANKS FOR GROWTH, lAC cyclical
but with some growth prospects, Burns
Philp and Co. Ltd. and W. R. Car-
penter Ltd. have some recovery
potential, but are not showing any un-
usual technical strength at present.
Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort is de-
cidedly weak.
The performance of the BANK OF
N.S.W. in terms of market appreciation
has certainly been better than the
average industrial and the current rise
suggests that further growth could be
expected for some time. After mov-
ing in a 60 percent uptrend from the
middle- of 1961, a topping situation
occurred followed by a downtrend dur-
ing the 1964/5 “bear” phase, when
prices finally recorded a low of $4.80.
The current uptrend suggests that prices
could eventually rise to about $9.50
for the long term. Last sale price on
13/11/67—56.40.
NATIONAL BANK OF AUSTRA-
LASIA also presents an overall growth
situation subject to the influence of
the “bull and bear” phases. It shows
the same topping situation at the be-
ginning of 1964 which preceded the
1964/6 downtrend, when prices even-
tually fell to a low of $1.75. The stock
has been in a steep uptrend since the
middle of the current year and at pre-
sent is away from any technical buying
position near the trendline. The base
consolidation suggests a long-term tar-
get of at least $4.20. Last sale price
on 13/11/67—53.14.
W. R. CARPENTER LTD. can
almost be compared with Burns Philp
and Co. Ltd. in that it shows lack of
overall growth since 1960, the best per-
formance being a 60 percent uptrend
which lasted until the 1964 top, before
a downtrend followed and sales were
recorded at $l.BO some weeks ago. The
price movement over the past few
weeks suggests that the downtrend
could at last be breaking, at this point
it would be difficult to indicate any
. upside target, yet it would hardly be
likely to be spectacular in view of the
resistance levels up to the 1964 top.
Last sale price on 13/11/67 —$2.15.
BURNS PHILP & CO. LTD. at
present does not indicate immediate
capital appreciation, contrary to the
Bank of N.S.W. In fact, the overall
picture consists of a sideways move-
ment since 1960, with only a brief up-
trend in 1963/4. Although prices broke
the downtrend early 1967, they have
since receded back toward the base
level and a breakout above $4.20 would
be required before a move of major
importance could be expected. A tar-
get of over $7.50 would then be a
possibility for the longer term, but
only if prices move above the $4.20
resistance level on high volume. Last
sale price on 13/11/67 —$4.00.
ELDER SMITH GOLDSBROUGH
MORT does not present any real
growth picture and a dqwntrend is still
intact. This stock showed promise
when initially reviewed with the pas-
toral group and at that time was fol-
lowing a 35 percent uptrend which
broke early 1967. Support would be
strong about the $2.00 level, but in-
vestors would be wise to avoid this
stock at present on technical grounds.
Last sale price on 13/11/67 —$2.20.
lAC HOLDINGS LIMITED could
be basically described as a cyclical issue
after the wide swings of price move-
ment since 1960 and clearly defined
trends. The base consolidation formed
since the 1964 downtrend suggests that
prices could eventually rise above the
$2.00 level. However, resistance would
be strong about the $1.50 price range.
Last sale price on 13/11/67 —$1.00.


THE SOUTH BRITISH INSURANCE COMPANY LIMITED
REVIEW BY THE CHAIRMAN
Mr. Kenneth B. Myers
of operations for the year ended 31st August, 1967
I have pleasure in submitting this
review on behalf of the Board.
REVENUE
Total premium income of the Group
rose by $2,640,295 to $36,851,797 and
in view of our continuing policy of
careful selection of business the increase
of 7.7% is regarded as satisfactory.
Of the additional premiums written
during the year, a total of $1,418,011
was appropriated in departmental ac-
counts as provision for unexpired risks,
leaving earned premiums for the year at
$35,433,786.
UNDERWRITING RESULT
Consolidated underwriting profit did
not follow the upward trend of revenue
and at $1,467,767 was a fall of $60,775
on the previous year but at 4.1% of
earned premiums compares more than
favorably with industry results of recent
years.
INVESTMENT INCOME
Income from investments, net of tax-
ation, yielded $2,314,129, an increase of
$69,587 over the previous year.
PROFIT
After provision for depreciation which
absorbed $397,845, consolidated Group
profit transferred to Appropriation
Account amounts to $3,384,051, an in-
crease of $18,939 on the figure returned
last year. This year’s profit is a record.
CONSOLIDATED PROFIT AND
LOSS APPROPRIATION ACCOUNT
Added to the sum brought forward
from the previous year, the transfer of
$3,384,051 from Profit and Loss Account
makes the total available $6,160,021. Of
this amount, $930,000 has been trans-
ferred to General Reserves and follow-
ing payment of an interim dividend of
5 cents per share, Directors recommend
a final dividend of 9 cents per share
to make a total dividend distribution
for the year of 14% compared with
13 1/3% last year.
UNDERWRITING REVIEW
FIRE DEPARTMENT. This de-
partment retained its position as the most
stable section of underwriting operations.
Revenue increased at a steady rate and
notwithstanding the mounting toll of fire
wastage in so many countries of the
world, losses were held to a figure
marginally above that of the previous
year. This speaks highly for the quality
and resilience of the fire account which
was called upon to absorb accumulations
of losses arising from the Hobart disaster
earlier this year, from storm damage in
Queensland and from unseasonal hail and
rainstorms in South Africa. A welcome
improvement in reinsurance business
accepted under international reciprocal
exchanges arranged principally in
London also contributed to the favour-
able result.
MARINE DEPARTMENT.—AIthough
revenue was more than maintained,
losses from marine and transit business
increased sharply to reduce the profit-
ability of this account to the lowest level
recorded for many years. This follows
the experience of marine underwriters
generally in a year which has seen a
steady succession of major casualties of
lesser valued vessels and their cargoes.
The incidence of theft and pilferage
claims continued at a regrettably high
level and is a source of constant concern.
To a large extent this is a by-product
of serious congestion at so many ports
of the world with consequent delays in
clearance of cargoes accompanied in some
cases by inadequate and . deteriorating
supervision by responsible parties con-
cerned.
Market reaction to adverse results is
becoming evident in a general hardening
of rates. So far as this Group is con-
cerned, however, steps have already been
taken to eliminate business which no
longer offers prospect of profit although
some time must necessarily elapse before
the benefit of this move is reflected in
our accounts.
ACCIDENT DEPARTMENT. A
large proportion of business accepted in
this department is concerned with
liabilities for loss of life, injury to per-
sons and damage to property. In asso-
ciation with delays and inflationary rises
in costs of settlements, these make the
accident account as a whole susceptible
to fluctuating year-to-year results. Thus,
while premiums increased by $1,385,686,
profit declined by $142,446 to $683,938.
Nevertheless, the ratio of losses to earned
premiums at 64.6% is within acceptable
limits considering the large Workmen’s
Compensation component from which we
neither look for nor expect more than a
nominal return.
Motor insurance yielded but a frag-
mentary margin and to offset the ever
doubtful quality of this type of business,
efforts are being directed towards im-
proving the balance of the accident port-
folio by development of registers of other
categories from which experience has
shown a reasonable profit can be ex-
pected. So far, these measures have met
with encouraging success.
TERRITORIAL REVIEW
NEW ZEALAND. In this, the
home field of the parent company, we
have experienced another satisfactory
year of progress in all departments. This
has been assisted by relatively stable con-
ditions which in the interests of all sec-
tions of the market—buyers, sellers, and
intermediaries should be upheld and
preserved.
Our network of branches is well
located and equipped to provide a first
class service, and to meet the needs
of increased staff, our premises at Hamil-
ton and Takapuna have been extensively
renovated to provide additional space
and improved working conditions. Work
on our new building adjoining Head
Office is. proceeding on schedule and
when completed will provide much-
needed accommodation • for our own
headquarters as well as the Guardian
Trust.
AUSTRALIA.—This is the home field
of the United Company and in asso-
ciation with our own extensive branch
organisation produces over 40% of the
Group’s total premium income.
Termination last year of the United
Company’s management agreement with
the A.M.P. Society’s 'non-life subsidiary
has allowed co-ordinated concentration
upon Group affairs with satisfying re-
sults. Good progress has been made in
every State with inland branches in
eastern areas recovering well from the
prolonged period of severe drought con-
ditions. In Western Australia, our new
premises at Bunbury and renovations to
Perth building have both been completed,
while in the expectation of further de-
velopment a property has been acquired
at Mackay, Queensland, on which erec-
tion of a suitable building to service
Group interests in the area will shortly
commence. Similarly at Gosford, New
South Wales, opportunity was taken to
purchase the property adjoining our
existing premises which, after reno-
vation, will provide enlarged and up-to-
date accommodation. The new building
in Brisbane which will house the branches
of both South British and United should
be ready for occupation early next year.
There can be little doubt that with
its diversified resources, the Common-
wealth offers excellent prospects for the
future and by assisting its economic de-
velopment, the Group can expect to
participate in the rewards.
As previously mentioned, results in
Australia were,affected by storm damage
in Queensland and the bush fire disaster
at Hobart which latter caflls for special
comment. Jt is a tribute to the insurance
industry as a whole and a demonstration
of its worth that it acted quickly in the
emergency and brought speedy relief to
those unfortunate enough to be directly
afflicted. The Group was proportionately
involved and Hobart manager and his
staff responded in exemplary fashion to
the exceptional demands imposed on
them by the unhappy tragedy which be-
fell the people and State of Tasmania.

AFRICA. In Africa, where opera-
tions are now confined to the parent
company, insurance in Tanzania was
nationalised on Ist January this year with
the consequent loss of a profitable port-
folio which, with the enthusiastic assist-
ance of our Agents, had been carefully
nurtured and developed over a period
of years. Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia
again contributed to Group profit al-
though on a somewhat reduced scale, but
in Aden, unsettled conditions have
seriously interfered with commercial
activity and prospects are decidedly un-
promising. Similarly in Nigeria, where
the outlook is clouded in doubt, it has
been necessary to curtail operations under
prevailing conditions.
On the other hand, our branches in
the southern part of the continent have
participated in the continuing economic
prosperity of the area although, during
the year under review, expansion of
revenue was accompanied by an unwel-
come deterioration of motor business in
addition to the storm losses previously
mentioned.
ASIA. Under the keenly com-
petitive and difficult conditions prevail-
ing in India, Pakistan, and the Far East,
our branches have more than held their
position, but they, together with African
branches, collectively write an appre-
ciable proportion of the Group’s marine
cargo account and were consequently
affected by the adverse results experi-
enced in that sphere. Nevertheless, they
continue to fulfil an important role in
Group operations as much for their value
in assisting the balance of our portfolios
as for their not inconsiderable contri-
bution to the profits of the Group.
UNITED KINGDOM. Following
decision last year to close provincial
offices, non-marine operations are now
conducted from London. The United
Kingdom market is experiencing a dif-
ficult period but by adherence to our
policy of prudent selection, we believe
our portfolio will yield a reasonable re-
turn.
The out-turn of business written in
the London and Liverpool marine
markets has been disappointing and it is
to be hoped that resolute action by these
market leaders will act as an example to
others and assist in restoring stability
and profitability to marine insurance.
In addition to underwriting operations,
London organisation acts as an important
and efficient service centre to other
branches as well as to Head Office, par-
ticularly in the fields of reinsurance and
settlement of marine claims.
EXPENSES
The expansion of income recorded
during the year was accomplished at a
relatively small increase in controllable
items of expenditure. In the area of staff
remuneration, increased costs in virt-
ually every field were successfully ab-
sorbed within acceptable limits, and ex-
pressed as a percentage of earned pre-
miums, total expenses including taxation
were below the previous year’s ratio.
INVESTMENTS
Problems of international liquidity
with their accompaniment of exchange
controls continue to restrict the mobility
of funds which would otherwise hav£
become available for investment. Con,
sequently, in some territories surplus
funds have had to be left on deposit at
short call with the lower return which
that attracts. Within the limits open to
us, however, your Directors are generally
satisfied that the disposition of the
Group’s resources as between countries
and classes of investment, provides the
most satisfactory combination of security
and income consistent with the interests
of policyholders and shareholders.
Fluctuations in interest rate's during
the year with the uncertainties they
create have affected market values but
as at last balance date, market values of
the Group’s investments exceeded book
values by approximately $1,000,000.
Group properties are acquired for the
fundamental purpose of supporting our
main business of insurance. In a
secondary sense, they are also an invest-
ment and for the interest of shareholders,
estimated market values have been main-
tained.
BALANCE SHEET
The recent failures in the United
Kingdom of a number of so called “cut
price” insurers have demonstrated, par-
ticularly to the motoring public of that
country, that cheap insurance is not
necessarily the best and equally, that the
financial strength of insurance companies
is a matter of prime importance. In
the latter context it is appropriate also
to emphasise that there is probably more
need now for insurers to accumulate ade-
quate resources against the possibility
of losses of catastrophic proportions than
there has been in the past.
The balance sheet of the Group re-
veals a very strong position and policy-
holders and shareholders alike will be
interested to know that reserves for un-
expired risks and provisions for out-
standing losses are adequate to commit-
ments under those heads. Furthermore,
free reserves represented by shareholders’
funds which increased during the year
by $ 1,362,769 to $33,420,828 firmly
under-pin the Group’s under-writing
activities.
DIRECTORS
Mr. C. J. Rogers reached the stipu-
lated retiring age and retired from the
Beard on 31st August, thus ending an
active and valued association with the
Company which extended over 60 years.
His intimate knowledge of the Com-
pany’s affairs has been of great assistance
in the Boardroom.
To fill the vacancy, Mr. A. G. Cook
has been appointed to the Board. Mr.
Cook is in practice as a Public Account-
ant and is also well known for his active
interest in public affairs.
This year, the Directors retiring in
rotation are Mr. T. H. Leys and Mr.
T. H. C. Caughey. In accordance with
the Company’s Articles of Association,
Mr : Cook also retires. All of these
gentlemen are eligible and offer them-
selves for re-election.
STAFF
It has not been an easy year for the
staff but they have acquitted themselves
extremely well in the face of challenging
and changing conditions. As a tangible
recognition of their efforts, provision has
again been made in the year’s accounts
for payment to them of a cash bonus.
Behind the balance sheets
A cleaning-up at
Simpson Pope
AT LAST THINGS SEEM to be look-
ing up a bit for Simpson Pope, the
South Australian integrated appliance
group that emerged four years ago
from the merger between Simpsons,
the successful washing-machine makers,
and Popes, the floundering electrical-
appliance people. But the market is
not at all convinced; no doubt fearing
the consequences of the drought in
southern Australia, investors are not
prepared to pay more than 27 cents
for the 50 cent shares, despite the fact
that Simpson Pope’s prospects seem
much better now than they did in 1965,
when the lowest price they hit was 35
cents.
Now all the company has to worry
about is the massive problem of making
and selling its products in a highly
competitive market; it no longer has
to cope with the backlog of the bad
debt and overstocking crises of three
and four years ago. It may even be
able to hope for a period of more or
less normal market growth for its pro-
ducts for the first time in years. For
the “anticipation of natural growth,” as
Simpson Pope chairman Mr. A. M.
Simpson called the “giving away” of
$lOO million worth of domestic appli-
ances to Australian consumers in about
five years up to 1966 (as measured by
the bad debts written off by retailers),
has meant a rather prolonged slackness
in demand ever since. His own com-
pany was one of the major victims of
the bad debtors, notably Reid Murray
and then H. G. Palmer.
Only in 1966-67, when the company
managed to earn 5.9 percent on capital,
its best rate yet, does it seem that the
bad debts position has been cleaned up.
(The eight percent earning rate of 1964-
does not count, for it included non-
existent profits on credit sales that were
never paid for.) The bad debts problem
still had its impact on the 1965-66 re-
sult, which suffered from a further
$230,000 bad-debts write-off, adding to
the $1 million write-off in previous years
comprising $510,000 for the complete
write-off of H. G. Palmer’s debt,
$325,000 pre-merger debts of Pope
Products, and $156,000 being all other
debts considered irrecoverable.
Something like normal conditions
have returned, with a bad-debts provi-
sion out of 1967 profits of $78,000 after
writing off $67,000. The provision now
stands at $155,625, or 5.4 percent of
trade debtors, and provided there are
no more Palmers or Reid Murrays this
should be adequate, although it is not
generous. Its provision against stocks,
to record variations in methods of valu-
ing work in progress was reduced to
$160,000 (less than two percent of
stocks) by writing off $162,366 in the
latest term. Service claims, another

AGE
common trouble source, have shown a
steady fall, which is a credit to Simp-
son Pope’s research and development
and that of the University of Adelaide,
which are also responsible for the perio-
dic introduction of new products.
The striking thing about the latest
profit improvement, then, is that it
represents the results only of cleaning
up, not of any rapid rise in business.
Sales increased only slightly in 1967,
but more efficient use of human mat-
erial and financial resources, plus
lower incidence of bad debts, pro-'
duced a “most encouraging result” (to
quote directors). If sales can be in-
creased, the company’s improvement
could be significant. The company it-
self gives no indication of sales, or even
the percentage increase or decrease in
sales. But Commonwealth production
statistics reveal a continuing upward
trend in domestic refrigerators and
electric ranges since 1962-63, peak pro-
duction of washing machines in 1964-
65, a recovery in mower production in
1966-67 to approximate 1962-63 levels,
and a strong recovery in room air-
conditioners in 1966-67 from a 1963-64
trough. In all products there have been
positive gains in July-August 1967 com-
pared with a year earlier; mower pro-
duction is up 28 percent, refrigerators
24 percent, electric ranges 3 percent,
room air-conditioners 71 percent, and
washing machines 15 percent.
Although S.A. has been the weakest
State of all in building approvals (the
September quarter was the worst of any
for five years) GM-H is reported to
have hired 600 employees in that State
in the past few weeks, which indicates
some industrial recovery, and which
may help offset the inevitable effect of
drought on consumer spending. But
there is another disadvantage in being-
located in South Australia; the group
estimates it would be $200,000 better
off each year if its plants were located
in Sydney. That’s what it costs to
.transport to major markets, anyway.
Pope had had a big loss in 1961 and
then a small profit. The Simpson com-
panies were profitable and sound, but
when they planned to go into refrigera-
tion production (which Pope was
already in) it seemed logical to avoid
this capital investment by a merger of
interests. This would give distribution
economies in overheads, service organi-
sation and buildings, and provide in-
ternal consumption for repetition grey-
iron castings and fractional horsepower
motors. They could jointly pay off some
of Pope’s borrowings by realising surplus
assets-and by more efficient use of funds
and from retaining profits. Their busi-
nesses were very largely complementary,
only competing in washing machines.
(A. Simpson was then the leading manu-
facturer of automatic and wringer-type
washing machines in Australia.) How-
ever, the two groups were quite dif-
ferent in structure and organisation,
and the protracted merger negotiations
caused problems and pressures which
were reflected in results.
At the time of the merger, it was
hoped the group would maintain six
percent ordinary dividends, but this was
only achieved in 1964. Surplus proper-
ties have been sold off since 1963 and
have now all been disposed of. In 1963
the company claimed saving of
$700,000 a year in reduced overheads
and improved buying power. By liquida-
ting obligations which had lost their
relevance hiring arrangements and
licensing agreements which duplicated
each other—and paying off some bor-
rowings, the company achieved greater
operating efficiency.
Debtors in 1967 were $2.7 million
compared with $3.7 million in 1963,
stocks $8.3 million ($9.5 million).
Investment in fixed assets was reduced
from $ll million to $lO million despite
considerable capital expenditure in
some years ($960,000 in 1965). Re-
arrangement and partial return of loan
funds has reduced the annual interest
bill from $335,000 to $243,000. These
economies and advantages were what
were expected of the merger. But in
terms of profit, results have been tardy.
It ha§ taken years to clean up the bad
debts, the appliance market has been
extremely competitive with constant
pressure on one hand on prices and on
the other hand wage and raw-material
cost increases.
Apart from 1964, when debtors were
still viewed with optimism and that
year’s results proved overstated in con-
sequence, the working profit before
tax and depreciation, as shown in the
table, shows nothing more than a hold-
ing position until 1967, when trading
results were definitely more promising.
(There was an abnormally high amor-
tisation of tooling after the merger in
1964.) Losses carried forward from
Pope Products have minimised tax to
negligible proportions for the past four
years. Just how much longer they will
be available, or when they will be ex-
hausted, is not divulged by directors,
but it seems reasonable to assume the
company will not be paying full tax
for another couple of years.
Appliance makers must be regarded
as cyclical stocks, and Pope’s down-
cycle has been longer than most; it is
certainly not for the faint-hearted, and
the market will continue to be wary un-
til the company is paying full tax. But
in the meantime prospects look brighter
than they have for three or four years.
Com petition is brisk, but Simpson
Pope are on the dividend list, with a
face-saving 2 percent, and a return to
par could be justified by further profit
progress this year.

Always a
jump ahead
Rank Xerox. A jump ahead in every sphere of graphic communications
A jump ahead of
obsolescence
You don't buy Rank Xerox
machines, you rent them. You
never have your money tied up in
a machine that will be obsolescent.
As you know, the field of graphic
communications is one where spec-
tacular advances are being made
every few months. When a new
machine comes into being and
you need it. Rank Xerox takes
away the old and installs the new.
A jump ahead of
salesmen
Rank Xerox have no salesmen,
only communications specialists.
That doesn’t mean just a high
falutin’ salesman. It means a man
with special qualifications in the
field of business management. A
man who talks your language; who
knows how to cut costs; increase
profit margins by speeding the
method and flow of accurate
communications, within your
business and to business associates.
A jump ahead in
accuracy
Rank Xerox machines copy any-
thing, any colour, onto bond
paper, in clear black and white.
Ball point pen, light pencil
corrections, come out exact. Three-
dimensional objects, too, like pages
from books, like fingerprints. In
fact, xerocopies are so accurate
they are the only machine copies
accepted legally as originals.
A jump ahead in
convenience
No masters necessary. No messy
inks. No special operators. No
time wasted.
A jump ahead in
savings
Increased productivity makes
money, saves money. Productivity
is stepped up by the immediacy of
shared information. No typing up
masters. No chance of transcription
errors. No time wasted sending
work out. A jump ahead in
efficiency that puts you a jump
ahead in savings.
A jump ahead in
model range
Right now, Rank Xerox can show
you a range of copying equipment,
each one handling different
volumes of work. One that could
help put your business a jump
ahead of competitors. There are
some pretty big surprises coming
up during '67 which we can’t let
out of the bag just now. But if
you’re already a Rank Xerox
renter, you’ll be first to hear
about them.
A jump ahead in
research
The Xerox research and develop-
ment programme for 1967 is, in .
round figures, $5O million. Rank
Xerox is committed to this
programme of research and
development. We are dealing not
only with the present, but laying
the foundations for future growth
and continuous expansion. Our way
of ensuring Rank Xerox will con-
tinue to be always a jump ahead.

Company Meeting:
COMENG HOLDINGS LIMITED
Copy of Speech delivered by the Chairman, Mr. F. P. Donohoe, at the Annual General Meeting of Stock-
holders of Comeng Holdings Limited held in Sydney on 14th November, 1967, is set out hereunder for
the information of Stockholders who were unable to attend the Meeting.
Ladies and Gentlemen,
Before moving for the adoption of the
Annual Report and Accounts may I firstly
take the opportunity of welcoming you to
this Twenty-first Annual General Meeting of
Stockholders of Comeng Holdings Limited. I
am sure that you will derive pleasure from
the fact that our twenty-first year of opera-
tions as a public company represents another
year of sustained earnings.
I am also pleased to inform you that the
past year has further enhanced the reputa-
tion of your Company, not only for the
quality of its products, but also for punctual
and efficient performance of its contractual
obligations and the high degree of engineer-'
ing skills at its command.
It is worth noting that the Oomeng Group
has never failed since 1949 to earn and pay
at least a 10% dividend and at the same
time it has over these years expanded to
become the largest manufacturer of railway
rolling stock in the southern hemisphere, in
addition to expanding into a variety of other
fields. Indeed, one could with some justifica-
tion dwell upon the past and upon the men
who have contributed to the consolidation of
your Company, but in today’s business climate
it is essential that the whole focus of our
attention be directed to the present and even
more importantly, to the future.
The Balance Sheet of the Company as at
30th June, 1967, and the Profit and Loss
Account for the year ended on that date, to-
gether with the reports thereon from your
Directors and the Company’s Auditors, were
forwarded to you with the Notice convening
this meeting. May I therefore assume that
I have your approval to take these documents
as read.
You will have observed that the consolidated
profit for the year available to Comeng
Holdings Limited (after deducting the net
interest of outside shareholders in the Com-
pany’s four partly owned subsidiaries) has
risen by 4.7% from $1,057,348 to $1,107,962 and
the ratio of these earnings to the issued
capital of the Company has increased from
27.15% to 28.45%.
These results are arrived at after deduct-
ing capital losses of $10,718 and after trans-
ferring $22,362 to the Provision for Contract
Contingencies and Research established dur-
ing the previous year and again discussed in
the Report of the Directors for the 1966-67
year.
I will now pass to a brief review of our
operations in Australia and South Africa.
AUSTRALIA:
I believe that you will again welcome news
of some of the more noteworthy contracts
secured by the Group in Australia during
the period under review. These include:—
<1) 59 Stainless Steel Railway Coaches for
the Sydney to Perth trans-Australia ser-
vice to commence operations early in
1969. Manufacture is already well under
way and you will have noticed photo-
graphs in the Annual Report detailing the
layout of the interiors of some of these
Coaches.
<2) 149 Iron Ore Wagons for Hamersley
Iron Pty. Ltd. These heavy duty vehicles
were and still are being supplied on tight
delivery schedules necessary to cope with
Hamersley’s export commitments.
<3) 10 Stainless Steel self-propelled rail diesel
cars for the Western Australian suburban
system.
<4) 70 Aluminium Coal Hopper Wagons for
the Queensland Government Railways.
These vehicles are designed to carry
maximum payloads from the new coal-
fields being opened in Central Queens-
land to support an export contract with
Japan.
(5) Assembly of 30 Clyde-G.M. Diesel Electric
Mainline Locomotives for use on the
Queensland Government Railways
System.
(6) 204 Bus Body Frames.
Despite receipt of one or two quite large
orders for railway rolling stock, it must be
acknowledged that the present national mar-
ket for railway rolling stock (after eliminat-
ing the equipment made by the various
Government Railways Workshops) is not suf-
ficient to provide continuous production lines
for the various companies in the industry
and this factor has caused your Directors to
intensify their continuous efforts towards
diversification.
In furtherance of this aim the Company
acquired, during the period under review, the
motor accessories and spare parts business
at Parramatta formerly owned by Mr. F. E.
Maling. This new activity will be operated
by our Grouse & Brown subsidiary. As fore-
shadowed at our last meeting, your Company
also increased its interest in Mining &
General Engineering Limited during the year,
and this interest now represents 73.65% of the
capital of that subsidiary.
It is pleasing to report that our planned
curtailment aimed at ultimate cessation of
activities in New Zealand is proceeding
smoothly and in fact a small profit was
earned by this activity during the year.
After consideration of the Group’s result
you will realise, Ladies and Gentlemen, that
despite all difficulties the Australian opera-
tions have performed creditably during the
year under review, as the overall Group re-
sults have been achieved despite a 19.5% drop
in our share of South African earnings and
despite an acute shortage of work for the
plants in New South Wales which has
seriously affected and continues to seriously
affect our earnings in this State. Nevertheless,
it must be acknowledged that the factors
mentioned have made the task of earning a
satisfactory profit a difficult problem for our
Company and all other companies in our
field.
Plant facilities in the Group’s Australian
factories have been maintained and certain
special purpose machines have been acquired
during the year.
The forward outlook for the current year
in Australia indicates earnings approaching
in amount those of the year just concluded,
but, nevertheless, the estimated profits avail-
able on general engineering and rolling stock
contracts are disappointingly low.
This Australian industry is no stranger
to temporary periods of low demand, but
the present trend, which is reflected in the
trading results and comments published by so
many companies in our industrv warrants
recognition and urgent attention to means of
encouraging local heavy industry.
EXPORT:
During the year under review your Direc-
tors have endeavoured to co-operate with the
national effort to develop exports.
Representatives of the Company have visited
Indonesia, Malaysia, Hong Kong, India, South
Africa and various other countries on speci-
fied assignments aimed at developing outlets
for the Company’s products and skills outside
of the Commonwealth of Australia.
While we have to date failed to achieve
any significant financial results from such
efforts, nevertheless, we feel that this Com-
pany has an obligation to use every endeavour
to press on with this work which we consider
not only as the pursuit of a worthwhile
objective of the Company, but also as the
discharge of a national duty.
In this regard I would like to publicly ex-
press our grateful appreciation to the De-
partment of Trade for the efficient and un-
tiring co-operation which we have received
from its officers within and outside of Aus-
tralia.
SOUTH AFRICA:
Union Carriage & Wagon Co. (Pty.) Limited
again completed a very successful year at its
Plant at Nigel in the Transvaal State of the
Republic of South Africa. A programmed drop
did occur in turnover and profit, but even
so deliveries to the South African Railways
included:
• 100 2500 H.P. Mainline Electric
Locomotives
• 251 Passenger and Officials Coaches
• 125 Heavy Duty Rail Tank Wagons
whilst 20 Crews Vehicles and 30 Refrigerator
Wagons were exported during the year.
It appears likely, however, that turnover
at Nigel for the 1967/68 year will represent
an increase over the year just concluded with
profits also showing some increase.
Orders secured by Union during the 1966/67
year amounted to $A24.1 million. In addition.
a further contract for $A7.7 million covering
supply of 145 Mainline Coaches, has just been
advised as I write this address' and therefore
has not been previously announced. The Nigel
Plant is obliged to pay continual attention to
design. developments. and production
efficiency as only in this way will it preserve
its impressive record of success achieved with
negligible tariff protection against very keen
international competition which not infre-
quently resorts to dumping.
As mentioned in the Report of the Directors,
South African rates of taxation on Company
profits and non-resident dividend payments
were increased during the year—the former to
36 2-3rds % and the latter t'o 15%. This had
the effect of adversely affecting our share of
South African earnings to the extent of
$A94,231.
The South African plant was visited during
the year on more than one occasion by our
Managing Director, Mr. A. A. Trimble, and
visits were also made by-myself and Mr. P. R.
Garland. The attitude of your Directors,
reinforced by impressions gained during these
visits, continues to be one of confidence in
the future.
GENERAL:
I believe that stockholders may view with
confidence the prospects of the Group for the-
foreseeable future.
Nevertheless, your Directors are conscious
of certain aspects of the heavy engineering
industry which require constant attention, if
our Group earnings are to be maintained.
The tendering system under which most of
our work is secured is ostensibly fair and
conducive to free competition, but in times
of low general demand it can be quite destruc-
tive to contracting companies forced to offer
uneconomic prices in an endeavour to secure
sufficient work to cover continuing overheads.
However, the problems are recognised and
your Directors and Management are con-
stantly seeking the most suitable means of
continuing cur successful counters to them.
Despite these conditions which have pre-
vailed now for a number of yeavs your Com-
pany’s strength and resources have steadily
increased, and we are confident of maintain-
ing the strength of the Group, even if this
should entail that we gradually abandon
some of our traditional fields of activity and
develop new ones.
As I have already mentioned, the Company
has demonstrated its ability, in an industry
of wildly fluctuating demand, to consistently
cover a 10% dividend and your Directors
believe that this 10% rate may rightly be
regarded as a basic rate which will be main-
tained. In accordance with our stated policy,
when the results of a particular year warrant
a distribution in excess of 10% your Board
will recommend a bonus distribution over and
above the base rate. Stockholders will be
aware that a bonus dividend has been recom-
mended by the Directors for each of the past
four year’s.
It is pleasing to report that Group earnings
for the first three months of the current year
are at a rate comparable to that of the
1966/67 year and that, subject to unforseen
circumstances, the results for the 1967/68
year should again warrant the payment of
a Bonus Dividend.
DIRECTORS AND STAFF:
I wish to pay tribute to the endeavours of
my fellow Directors during the year and to
thank them for the wholehearted co-operation
which they have extended to me as Chairman.
We would all wish to record our appreciation
for the loyalty and efficiency of the Manage-
ment and Staff throughout the period.
CONCLUSION:
Finally. Ladies a.nd Gentlemen, it affords
me pleasure to move that the Balance Sheet
of the Company as at 3Cth June, 1967, the
Profit and Loss Account for the year ended
on that date and the Reports of the Directors
and Auditors thereon be received and
approved, and I invite some stockholder to
second the motion.
F. P. DONOHOE.
Chairman of Directors.

AUSTRALIAN NEWSPRINT MILLS HOLDINGS LIMITED
ADDRESS BY MR. R. A. HENDERSON,
Chairman of AUSTRALIAN NEWSPRINT MILLS HOLDINGS LIMITED.
to shareholders at the Tenth Annual General Meeting held at Melbourne,
on Bth November, 1967
Our expansion program is well under way and to the end of October
committed contracts total more than $l6 million for plant and buildings.
Installation of the major piece of equipment, the newsprint manufacturing
machine, commenced on schedule about two months ago.
Some sections of the new plant would already have been in use if we
had not had to accept electric power rationing.
To guard against the possibility that power may still be rationed in
1969, when we will be ready for full-scale operations, we plan to install an
alternator capable of generating about 30 percent of our power needs.
This will cost about $1 million. Arrangements have been made with
the Tasmanian Government concerning its purchase and operation. .
Apart from our expansion program, power rationing is adversely affecting
our current operations.
Last year our production of newsprint reached a new record level, 4000
tons ahead of the previous year and 30 percent above the level for which
the plant was designed.
In the absence of power rationing which we expect to result in a
reduction of our supply by 25 percent from the beginning of October to
the end of June we would have expected to set new production records
again this year.
Our management is making every effort to achieve the maximum results
from the rationed power available. This has necessitated some experimentation
with new methods.
To a substantial degree these new methods are succeeding, but it is
inevitable that there will be some decline in output and in profit this year.
We cannot yet assess the extent of the fall.
We feel these are short-term difficulties and there is no doubt about the
continued success of our operation when the power supply returns to normal.
Our new newsprint manufacturing machine will add to our strength.
In closing I would like to pay tribute to the contribution made by Sir
Lloyd Dumas who retired from the board last December. Sir Lloyd was an
original director of our operating company when it was formed in 1938.
He had been continuously on the board since that time and his constant faith
in the future of our industry was unbounded.
I now move that the balance sheet of 30th June, 1967, the profit and
loss account for the year then ended, and the directors’ and auditors’ reports
as circulated be received and adopted.
Alining
Associated Oil's
gas and coal
COMPARED TO THE VALUE it
has placed on other companies, the
market’s valuation of the Associated
Oil group appears very moderate. At
current prices the market value of
shares issued by the various members
of the group amounts in total to $l9
million. The group consists of Associ-
ated Australian Oilfields, Associated
Continental Petroleum, Associated
Freney Oilfields, and Papuan Apinaipi
Petroleum. The group has yet to earn
any profits from its prospecting activi-
ties for petroleum and other minerals,
but its prospects do not seem to be
very highly priced in today’s market.
The group has been able to obtain
customers for the sale of 100,000 mil-
lion cubic feet of natural gas from its
leases in the Roma district of Queens-
land. This gas is to be sold over a
period of 15 years, will bring the group
a payment of some $lO million, and
will allow a dividend to be paid by
the pipeline company to the group
companies of some $2.3 million. Sales
in excess of contracted quantities
would bring higher returns, and,
should the company be able to sell
half as much again, it would receive
twice as much profit, the increased
rate of return being the result of the
early amortisation of pipeline borrow-
ings over existing contracts.
The contracts for the supply of this
gas are the first substantial rewards for
the group’s many years of exploration
activities. It is somewhat paradoxical
that even better prospects will come
not from petroleum or natural gas but
from that rather more pedestrian fuel,
black coal. In November, 1966, the
group began drilling in the Bluff area
of Queensland near Blackwater, west
of Rockhampton, and obtained indi-
cations of substantial tonnages of good-
quality hard coking coal in five seams
ranging from six to 20 feet thick at
depths from 60 to 300 feet below
ground level. Continued drilling has
established that these deposits contain
some 100 million tons of coal. An ad-
jacent lease held by the group contains
a number of promising coal outcrops,
while over ten million tons of good
quality anthracite coal has been proved
at shallow depths.
Two other areas just south of Moura
contain underground deposits of
medium-volatile coking coal and large
reserves of high-quality steaming coal
suitable for open-cut mining. This latter
deposit is at Theodore and is adjacent
to the Dawson River. Thiess Holdings
Limited own a coal tenement adjoin-
ing the Associated group’s Theodore
deposit and the two companies have

Australia’s competing banks provide a range of banking
services that not only help maintain the pace of develop-
ment in Australia, but provide a stimulus wherever people
with initiative demonstrate that they have a contribution
to make to Australia’s progress.
Australia’s prosperity is the result of the enterprise of
people and their banks.

made a joint submission to the Queens-
land Electricity Authority for the supply
of steaming coal for a possible future
power station in the area. With increas-
ing exports of iron ore to Japan, and
plans by the Western Australian iron
ore miners to commence primary pro-
cessing, the group’s deposits at Bluff
appear to have good potential.
Nor is coal the only other mineral
being sought by the group. In both
Queensland and South Australia in-
vestigations are being carried out both
by the group itself and in conjunction
with other companies to test various
areas. Peeler and Associates of the
U.S.A. is financing exploration in re-
turn for a 50 percent interest in an
8-square-mile lease near Texas, on the
Queensland-New South Wales border,
which has in its time produced 2 mil-
lion ozs. of silver together with gold,
copper, and lead from massive sulphide
ore bodies. A joint venture has re-
cently been completed with Cyprus
Mining Corporation of the U.S.A. for
the exploration of mineral leases near
Clermont for zinc and copper, while
at Pidinga, in South Australia, the
company is investigating likely de-
posits for mineral salts.
The coal deposits at Bluff are on the
main railway and hence accessible to
the coal loading facilities at Gladstone
through which Thiess-Peabody-Mitsui is
already shipping coal at a rate of some
million tons per year (to be in-
creased to million tons in April,
1968). Pickands, Mather, and Maru-
beni-lida of Japan have been sug-
gested as likely partners with the
Associated group in the development
of this field.
IN THEIR REPORT for the year to
June, directors of E.Z. Industries
Limited in no uncertain terms re-
inforced their company’s position as a
mining company. Development work at
the West Coast mines continued and
diamond drilling was intensified. Deep
drilling carried out in the Roseberry
mine allowed a further increase of
500,000 tons in established ore reserves
after the extraction of almost 300,000
tons. Reserves now stand at 7,500,000
tons.
Details are also given of the new
shaft which the company is to sink at
these mines during the next few years.
The new shaft will be equipped to per-
mit a substantial increase in production
if required and will be sunk to an event-
ual depth of 3770 feet, costing in excess
of $4,000,000. Tenders have been called
for the sinking of this shaft and associ-
ated access and haulage tunnels and two
tenders are currently under consider-
ation.

Commodities
Can tin overcome
excess supply?
AS WITH A NUMBER of other com-
modities, tin was bought quite heavily
in London last week. Spot (mid-) prices
finished reasonably steady at £stgl2l9J
a ton, but at one stage the forward price
touched £1225, coming back mainly
on profit-taking. Seeing that a good
deal of hedging and consumer price-
fixing was around, only one conclusion
could be drawn: the immediate opera-
tions were provoked by sterling’s ner-
vous situation. A host of commodities
will become more costly to Britain as
a result of devaluation.
These were, of course, all highly
speculative moves. Yes, so far as tin is
concerned, it has been fairly clear for
the last three weeks or so that the
weak position obvious since August, is
being altered. The latest price rises are
largely ascribed to fears (or rumors) of
a technical squeeze, since the metal’s
statistical outlook hardly warrants a
revision.
Indeed, the International Tin Coun-
cil’s most recent figures plainly show a
world output of primary tin well in ex-
cess of last year. More significantly,
production finished up 4600 long tons
ahead of demand for the first seven
months of the current year, contrasting
with 1966’s excess demand of 10,500
tons (satisfied by releases from the
American stockpile).
In trouble with rubber, Malaysia has
also not held back on tin. It will almost
certainly achieve production of more
than 70,000 tons, against last year’s
68,886 tons. Increased output is occur-
ring in Thailand and Indonesia, too;
lower prices have not exercised any
warning. Tied to them, they have natur-
ally affected Australian companies; for
instance, Aberfoyle Holdings’ latest
profit fell from $643,198 to $320,574.
Falling demand from European in-
dustrial consumers chiefly induced the
earlier price drift, so the ITC Buffer
Stock manager had to 'buy in (prob
ably about 1500 tons) when prices went
below £l2OO a ton. Present LME
stocks are estimated to total about 2500
tons, of which some 1000 tons
would be available for trading.
Some authorities believe that over-
supply is purely temporary. Much of
the Malaysian output boom proceeds
from the starting up of over 400 new
gravel pump mines; these may not be
able to survive if prices don’t remain
fairly high. Depressive circumstances
could also take toll of some new mines
in other producing countries.
RUBBER PRICES have been looking
a little better in London, yet any slight
improvement is certainly unaccom-
panied by significant increases in de-
mand from the major consumers. And
the Malaysian Government’s support
moves on the Singapore market aren’t
blessed with overwhelming success. In-
deed the Government has had to
threaten confiscation of the licences of
dealers allegedly operating “unethical
practices ” claiming it possesses evi-
dence of market manipulation by a
foreign-based company.
To add to the confusion, the Govern-
ment is. put at pains to deny that it has
insufficient finance to continue support
buying, tacking on to its denial the
rider that “the market structure can be
changed if necessary.” London commen-
tators believe the so-called manipula-
tions are only normal free-market tac-
tics. The historically low price level
undoubtedly flows from reduced pur-
chases and large overhanging stocks,

in February next. The pessimists tend
to assert that these conferences and their
preliminaries yield nothing but expenses.
It doesn’t seem technically sufficient, as
Malaysia has done, to concentrate just
on fair trade practices in putting the
case for rubber; quotas and other posi-
tive devices must be thoroughly dis-
cussed by the producers of natural be-
fore they can expect to “talk turkey”
with the synthetic manufacturers, and
the consuming countries.
Competition with synthetic will never
really lessen. Just recently another
hurdle was put in natural’s path: an
American tyre company has developed
a new synthetic polymer which ap-
parently satisfies all the specifications of
natural. Until now, the qualities of
natural have never been fully matched.
THE CASE AGAINST too great a
devotion to cotton growing in Aus-
tralia was well argued in last week’s
Bulletin by Agrisearch (page 77). Now
reports have started arriving that the
crop in the United States, the world’s
largest exporter, will probably be the
smallest for 46 years. Lest the unwary
take wild encouragement from this,
they should be reminded that Russian
harvestings (at about ten million bales)
will for the first time exceed Ameri-
can; Mainland China could almost
equal Russia, and record harvests are
predicted from Turkey and Pakistan.
Cotton prices are keeping up, how-
ever, in the face of the supply, since
American mills, which are not allowed
to import raw cotton, are bidding them
up to secure their needs from the
lower domestic crop. European spinners
find the levels of good qualities rather
high. In fact, American shippers are
not quoting them for export.
The 1967 output from the U.S. will
be just below eight million bales, or
some two million bales under earlier
estimates. Planting controls and bad
weather have led to the fall. But the
inevitable is happening to lift produc-
tion: next year a price-support pro-
gram is to be brought into operation,
aiming to raise the crop to 13.5 million
bales. The question then becomes how
much will be available for export.
ALUMINIUM CONSUMPTION in
Australia seems to be moving ahead
quite nicely, although the Aluminium
Development Council is convinced that
there are many more fields of usage
lying open. Metal consumed in 1966
totalled nearly 191 million lb., an ad-
vance of 7 million lb. on 1965. The
1966 figure represented a per capita
consumption of about 16.51 b. to com-
pare with the U.K.’s 211 b. and France’s
151 b. There is, of course, a big jump
to be made to reach the United States’
level of 431 b. a head (for 1966).
The American aircraft and defence
industries naturally give the latter
figure a big boost. So far as Australia
is concerned, the ADC believes the
transport industry generally contains
a high potential for increased usage.
It is interesting to note that Aus-
tralia exported 45.8 million lb. of
unwrought metal in 1966 and that the
previous year had seen exports of 51
million lb. Wrought products exported
for 1966 reached 14.3 million lb. (pre-
viously 4.4 million lb.).
The domestic price of 99.5 percent
ingot has stayed at $520 a. ton c.i.f.
capital cities since March, 1965, in
line with the long-standing U.K. price
of £stg.l96 a ton.

TYPEWRITER
The IBM 72 electric is often referred to as "tomorrow's
typewriter today." Here are the reasons why
1. IBM electric typewriters are the only typewriters with
interchangeable type faces. Sixteen of them, designed
to permit a single typewriter to meet all business needs.
You Gan change from light to heavy, from small to large
to mathematical universal symbol, all within a single
page if you want to. It takes five seconds (and two
fingers) to change type faces on the IBM 72 typewriter.
2. The type ball prints characters faster than the eye can
follow. This is because it eliminates type bars (which
have several inches to travel to the ribbon), and is never
more than a fraction of an inch from the ribbon.
3. The type ball is combined with a unique stroke
storage system. When two keys are pressed almost
simultaneously, the second waits till the first is printed.
The type ball prints faster than the world's fastest typist,
yet it helps eliminate human error.
4. The keyboard that controls the type ball is precision
engineered—feather-light, with impression control. No
more pounding—no more uneven typing.
5. The type ball does away with the moving carriage.
Result —far less vibration, and far more desk room.
Nothing moves but the type
ball. And only IBM has it. Call
us at IBM for a demonstration.

THE LAND
Lessons of the foot-and-mouth
outbreak in Britain
IN THE MIDST OF all its heavy
economic troubles, Britain has run
into an extraordinarily bad outbreak
of foot-and-mouth disease by far the
worst since the war. The attacks
began just over three weeks ago and
already some 93,000 animals have had
to be killed. All movement of farm
animals in England and Wales has
been forbidden. The total financial loss
to farmers may at this moment, with-
out allowing for extension of the
disease, be in the region of £stgs mil-
lion.
The disease’s rapid, rather inexplic-
able spread makes this epidemic pecul-
iarly alarming. The disease usually
spreads through contact at some local
market: though this can scatter the
cases around the countryside, it is
quite easy to track down infected ani-
mals and stop further outbreaks. But
the new bout of cases seems to bear no
such relation to any other: the pat-
tern of the spread, north-east across
the Cheshire plain, suggests that the
virus might even be being carried by
the wind. This, of course, would mean
that the Ministry of Agriculture’s elab-
orate and extremely efficient pre-
cautions against spread through con-
tact will need a bit of rethinking.
How it started is another mystery.
While Britain is seldom entirely free
from the disease, there have been
only two other outbreaks this year, and
neither has apparently any connec-
tion with the present one. Migrating
starlings seems a fanciful explanation.
It is more likely, though far from cer-
tain, that swill feeding began the whole
trouble. Over 50 percent of outbreaks
in recent years have been on swill-feed-
ing farms: this is in spite of regula-
tions about boiling the stuff first, which
suggests some slack farmers. Ordinary
household scraps are the real danger.
One answer would be to vaccinate
all British animals. France, West Ger-
many, and Italy, as well as some South
American and African countries, all now
enforce annual vaccination, at least
of cattle. If this epidemic gets worse
and many more animals are slaugh-
tered, there may be the same sort of
pro-vaccination noises made as there
were in the 19505. But the situation
has changed little since the Gower
committee reported against vaccination
in 1954. No vaccine has yet been dis-
covered which will give immunity
against all types of v.rus or for very
long. Vaccination is also extremely
expensive .
The French Government, which
makes the farmer pay almost all the
cost, has to fork out million a year
itself, for cattle alone (admittedly
there are more French than British
cows). The West Germans, who have
just started universal vaccination, paid
over £4 million for a far from universal
vaccination last year; Italy, vaccin-
ating only five million cattle in the
north, spent even more. For compari-
son, the British Government over the
past ten years has spent an annual
average of under £f million in com-
pensation payments; which is not much
more than France and West Germany
spent on slaughter of infected animals
and contacts, on top of the cost of
vaccination.
Of course, much of the cost of a
slaughter policy is borne by the farm-
er w'hose herd is destroyed. Though the
compensation is at market price, and
allows for pedigree value, it cannot be-
gin to make up for the “consequential
loss” from empty farm buildings,
difficulties in building up a new herd
or flock, and so forth. These hardships,
however, are less important than the
fact that food-and-mouth cannot be
allowed to become endemic be-
cause of the damage it could do to
exports of breeding stock to disease-
free countries.
But it would require a worse epi-
demic than any of those which have
occurred in Great Britain since the
1920 s to suggest that vaccination, in its
present unsatisfactory form, would be
worth while. From 1962 to 1965 there
was only one single case of the disease,
and only a few in 1966. So slaughter
remains the only viable policy.
Australia has been singularly free
from these kind of outbreaks. It is,
perhaps, all too easy to rail against the
rigidity of the quarantine regulations,
especially as they effect the importation
of breeding animals. But they, plus a
fair measure of luck, have preserved
the country from many noxious pests
and diseases. Our proximity to, and
increased trading relations with, some
risky Asian areas make vigilance all the
more necessary.
Agrisearch
A question of research finance
BY ANY RECKONING the Austra-
lian Meat Research Committee is a
hard-driving outfit. The scale of its
operations has created difficulties for
others and brings into question the
wisdom of financing research with pri-
vate money. This year the Committee
has put out $2,139,151 to support 146
research projects. Unfortunately, for
the next four years it will have to
curtail this outlay by about 10 percent
as a result of the 1965-66 drought.
Continuing drought throughout south-
eastern Australia could lead to further
cuts. The Committee has already served
notice on the recipients of its bounty
—the State Departments of Agriculture,
CSIRO, universities, Northern Terri-
tory Administration, and the Bureau
of Agricultural Economics—that it is
about to decide where cuts will be made
in the current research program.
The money that the Committee con-
trols comes from a levy on the slaught-
ering of cattle, sheep, and lambs for
meat, with a matching contribution
from the Commonwealth Treasury. The
maximum rate of the levy has been
struck at 20 cents per head for cattle
and 3.3 cents per head for sheep and
lambs. At the moment the maximum
rate is being collected on cattle, but
only 1.75 cents on each sheep and
lamb slaughtered. By raising the sheep
level the Committee could go some
of the way toward wiping out the short-
fall, but not very far. In the crisis
the best solution surely would be for
the Commonwealth. Government to kick
in the extra sum required—a relatively
trifling amount compared with the $4B
million found so readily for dam build-
ing on the Ord River far away.
Because it has to take into account
the unknown and unforeseen, research
planning is not easy at the best of
times. Generally, the first discovery
made in any scientific investigation is
that the problem is more complex than
it had appeared at the outset and that
additional research resources must be
committed to it. Scientific research,
therefore, has a natural growth. Check-
ing it before maturity is invariably
wasteful. An extreme example would
be the abandonment of a scheduled

five-year experiment in its fourth year.
The risk of having to damp down re-
search projects suddenly is inherent in
all the industry levy schemes, because
their funds depend on uncontrollable
variables such as the market or the
season.
For this and other reasons any re-
search director would prefer to have
his fiscal support come from the State
or Federal Treasury rather than from
industry. To shield themselves from
the frustrations brought on by unpre-
dictable reductions in cash support, re-
search scientists are happy to see as
much of the industry money as possible
channelled into capital works. Pro-
ducers’ money is used for the con-
struction of laboratories and the hire
of bricklayers rather than scientists and
the provision of their immediate, ex-
pendable needs. In short, industry funds
are used to furnish national assets which
ought to be the privilege of the general
taxpayer. Another undesirable con-
sequence of this stratagem from the
industry’s point of view is that its in-
fluence over the .research program is
whittled away.
While we are stuck with the present
system it would be to everyone’s advan-
tage if the disbursements from industry
funds were adjusted to a constant figure
calculated on the levy collections of an
average year. Excess money collected
in good years should be held in kitty
against below-average years. To get
the system started, the Government
might have to provide those industry
schemes that are temporarily embar-
rassed with some sort of cushion grant.
Actually, the more Government money
that gets mixed up in these schemes
the better. There are at least two
further reasons why industry support
for research should be faded out.
In the first place, agricultural re-'
search leads to higher standards of liv-
ing for everyone in the community and
not just the wheatfarmers or the wool-
grower. Indeed, it tends in the long
run to put the farmer under greater
pressures than before. Secondly, and
more importantly, industry involvement
in research introduces a bias which a
small economy such as Australia’s can
ill afford. Wheatgrowers put up money
for wheat research when what may be
needed is sorghum research. We can-
not do both properly because our total
research resources are too limited.
If, for instance, the Government is
fair dinkum about the Ord scheme and
truly knows that it promises riches in
cotton, sorghum, and beef, then it
should immediately follow up its dam
money with additional grants for
agricultural research on these products
in that area. One reason why this will
not happen on an appropriate scale,
anyhow, is because all the country’s
agrostologists are already fully com-
mitted researching matters of particular
interest to wheat, wool, and beef pro-
ducers elsewhere. Ironically, in this
particular case, however, the Govern-
ment is being stopped from throwing
good money after bad.


ARTS AND I
Primitive painter of Paddington
By APRIL HERSEY
CEDRIC FLOWER, whose work is
now showing at Sydney’s Macquarie
Galleries—“the first exhibition he has
bothered about for years and years”
is an artist who pleases himself, goes
quietly along his own road, and lets the
surf of art fashions and art booms rise
and fall about him unheeded.
“If I keep at it in my own way long
■enough I may emerge at the other end
of the cycle—in the forefront of a new
movement. Who knows?”
Interested but unperturbed by chang-
ing fashions in art, he does not belong
to any gallery, just paints and sells. “I
have a very loyal following. But I think
you need to stay with your own genera-
tion. When I began there were a few
people \vho ran galleries and put
together exhibitions. Now it is all high-
pressure selling, with dealers and
involved sales and dinner parties. That’s
not my style. I go on painting in the
same old way and selling in the same
old way at much the same prices, com-
paratively speaking.
“I don’t like to think that people who
want paintings are priced out of the
market, because there is a boom at
present. I think I would rather sell four
paintings for a reasonable price than
just sell one at some fantastic figure,
particularly if the four will go to homes
.and the one just be a gallery item.
“It upsets me that paintings are now
so expensive. A lot has to do with
marketing techniques. But in a society
where obsolescence is being built into
•cars and so forth, why not include paint-
ings? I would love to be able to fill my
house with the sort of huge mad paint-
ings we had here in the American Exhi-
bition, but only for a year or two.
Then I might like some other extrava-
gance. I don’t see why every painting
must be considered a masterpiece. It
would be fantastic to be able to change
one’s environment in this way, much
more satisfactory than having new cars.
Perhaps we can evolve a method of
silk-screening paintings for $5O so that
we can all enjoy them again.”
Flower feels that the days when a
painter worked quietly away at his
easel with his canvas nicely stretched are
practically finished. “So much more is
expected. It is getting back to the days
of the Renaissance when a painter had
to sculpt his Pope, erect the niche, gild
the halo, and finally paint the statue.
I like to think of this total involvement
thing. I find these works fascinating, but
I continue in my own way.”
So far, in his own opinion, none of
his critics or his admirers have placed
him correctly in contemporary art. “I
am a regional primitive painter. No
one seems to notice this. I keep doing
fresh work on old themes, namely, Pad-
dington and Tilba Tilba.”
His early interest in Paddington,
where his mother used to live and
where he came to see a girlfriend in
student days, is probably the reason for
the Paddington revival. His delicate
pen-and-wash treatment of the old
houses and winding streets took away
the existing drabness and made prospec-
tive home-buyers realise the potential of
a Paddington terrace “done up.” Now
he lives in Paddington himself, but has
a house in Tilba, where he goes “for
months on end” with his playwright
wife, Pat.
She has just had a notable success
in England, where her first play,
accepted directly by the BBC, will be
produced in color, a moment of history
in British television.
Her husband has also branched out
into playwriting. “I have just finished
my first play. I think there is a frus-
trated playwright trying to get out, but
then I am always fascinated by what
other people are doing. It always looks
so much more interesting and I feel I
must have a bash, too.”
Though he has been painting and
drawing since his childhood and began
as a commercial artist at the age of 14
with no other formal art training than
an evening life class, he has also been
drawn strongly to the theatre and to
writing.
Next year his first book (he has
illustrated many but this is the first he
has written and compiled) will be pub-
lished by Angus and Robertson Ltd.
This is “Duck and Cabbage Tree,” a
history of dress in Australia which
required a search for information and
photographs to many parts of Aus-
tralia.
“There was nothing in permanent
form. This is the first book on the sub-
ject and, according to the libraries, one
they will welcome, but to make it a
reality I had to ferret about in old
advertising brochures, fashion pages,
and newspapers. I began years ago
when I did ‘The Sentimental Bloke’
and again when I was asked to research
a film to be made in Australia with
Liz Taylor and Richard Burton. The
film came to nothing, but the research
I did into prewar fashion was very
helpful.”
After the fashion book he may think
of other similar texts which he would
enjoy doing. Meanwhile, he is still being
appreciated as an artist. People can still
afford his paintings and they don’t part
with them too easily. They follow their
owners to many parts of the world, and
Sidney Nolan recently reported one of
them in Cairo.
An interest in architecture, particu-
larly Australian architecture of the
mid-19th century and the Victorian
period, has prompted him to teach at
the University of N.S.W. School of
Architecture to the second-year archi-
tecture students. His subject is graphic
communication. “I enjoy it immensely,
just one morning a week, but it puts
me in contact with a new generation.”
He is also chairman of the Historic
Buildings Committee for the National
Trust a job he finds well worth
doing. “Now the Trust is respected
enough for Government departments to
ask advice, and I feel we are getting
Cedric Flower.. . going his own way
somewhere.” His present concern is for
The Rocks, which he considers the most
fascinating part of Sydney and where
he lived for years at the old Ship and
Mermaid. He is pleased that Argyle
Place, in fact the whole western side
to the bridge approach, will remain
intact, and is at present working with a
restaurateur to design an early Aus-
tralian tavern with decor and costumes
of the 1840 period. “I’m the first per-
son to need my own book.”


"Weird" result
By CHARLES HIGHAM
SINCE “They’re a Weird Mob”
cleaned up a cool $3 million profit in
Australia we have been asking our-
selves: what happened to the money,
and why hasn’t the company which
made it, Powell-Williamson, produced
another picture from the profits?
I asked John McCallum, Australian
director of the company and now
executive producer of Fauna Produc-
tions which has been making the
“Skippy, the Bush Kangaroo” series,
why no further production had been
finished. He said: “It’s a sad story. We
simply haven’t seen the profits from the
picture at all.”
The fact is that the Rank Organisa-
tion, distributors of the film, has not
yet paid any profits to the producers.
“We handed them the film on a plat-
ter,” McCallum said. “We had to,
owing to their investment in the bud-
get.” He pointed out that the public
pays the exhibitor, that is Greater
Union Theatres in the case of “The
Mob,” who deduct an undisclosed
amount for theatre rentals, running
costs, and profit (which must be 30
percent of the gross at least, judging
by the final result). Then the Aus-
tralian distributor, British Empire Films
in this case, an Associated Company of
Greater Union and the Rank Organisa-
tion, takes overheads and expenses and
pays the balance, called film hire, to
the Rank Organisation, which deducts
35 percent of this balance for distribu-
tion charges, and the poor producer has
what is left, in this case less than 20
percent of the gross. Of the Australian
box-office takings of $3,000,000 the pro-
ducers have so far received less than
$500,000, which is $lOO,OOO short
of their own budget for the film.
Therefore, $2,500,000 has gone to
Greater Union Theatres, British Em-
pire Films, and the Rank Organisa-
tion. “They’re a Weird Mob” will
eventually make some profit for the
producers, but not until some time next
year. Over a five-year period the profit
could be a good one, as there will be
television sales particularly in
America—sales to other countries, and
a rerun in Australia.
Neither Greater Union nor Hoyts
has in recent years ploughed back any
part of their substantial profits into
local production, and this deeply dis-
turbs McCallum and men like him who
are trying to get an Australian indus-
try on its feet. But the lesson of “The
Mob” has been bitter, and McCallum
and his associates will arrange a much
better deal for their next film, which
will be “Bony,” based on one of the
books of Arthur Upfield.
This will be made next winter, all
being well, after Powell has finished
“The Age of Consent” with James
Mason, from the novel by Norman
Lindsay, an independent production
made with American money. “Bony”
will be made in collaboration with
Associated British Picture Corporation
of England, the opposing chain to Rank,
with a split-market deal, whereby Bona-
parte Films, the producing company,
will retain the Australian and Far-
Eastern market, and ABPC the British
market, with a division of the profits
fair to all parties. Despite the ABPC
tie-up, Greater Union, controlled by
Rank, may possibly distribute the film
here, with a better set of terms for the
producers; McCallum is also hoping
that by the middle of next year an
Australian film finance corporation will
be set up by the Government. He
says Prime Minister Holt has promised
to give serious consideration to this.

Slightly wet
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Umbrellas Of Cherbourg. Director,
Jacques Demy.
A Fistful Of Dollars. Director, Sergio
Leone.
IN THE FORM-VERSUS-CONTENT
argument which seems to engage the
minds of some French film-makers,
Jacques Demy comes out strongly on
the side of form. In “Lola,” a film
whose “elusive charm” certainly eluded
me, the plot was vague and fragmen-
tary. In “The Umbrellas Of Cher-
bourg,” there really isn’t one at all.
It is a simple little tale about a
pair of young lovers parted when the
boy goes to his military service in
Algiers, leaving the girl pregnant.
Since the boy is a poor letter-writer,
the girl concludes that he has aban-
doned her and marries an obliging
suitor who is willing to accept the
child. (He turns out to be Lola’s silent
adorer from the previous film, but I
don’t know why Demy thought fit to
drag that in, except as a sort of
artistic blackmail.) When the young
man returns, he consoles himself by
marrying another girl, and he and his
former sweetheart only meet once by-
chance to congratulate themselves wist-
fully on how well everything has turned
out.
Since there’s nothing very absorbing
in the subject matter, Demy has con-
centrated on technique, which is so
contrived and obtrusive that it re-
moves any elegiac charm that might
emerge from the story. He plays about
with color: the characters’ clothes
blend in with the backgrounds (papered
walls, stucco, etc.), or clash viciously
with them; colors change deliberately
from one shot to the next. Compared
with the sophistication of Antonioni’s
use of color, this film looks affected
and gimmicky.
The dialogue of the entire film is
sung, a trick which I found meaningless
and tiresome. Puccini and Verdi can
get away with it, but Michel Legrand
is hardly in the class. Apart from one
theme, the rest is recitative, which is
acceptable enough when the characters
are professing eternal love but sounds
absurd when a garage-hand warbles:
“Super or standard?”
The cast is a great deal too good
for the film. Catherine Deneuve is
always delightful to look at even when
dressed in wallpaper, and French
wallpaper at that.
“A Fistful Of Dollars” is one of
a series of Italian-made Westerns which
has had an unaccountable success in
Europe, where apparently everyone’s
making Westerns. Perhaps they’d better
leave them to the Americans, who’ve
had more practice.
Clint Eastwood plays (or anyway,
appears as) a wandering hired gun of
the Shane persuasion w-ho comes to a
Mexican bordertown run by two rival
factions. Their only occupation is
killing each other, partly because of
general enmity, partly on account of
“the gold.” What with an incompre-
hensible script and the heavily accented
dubbed dialogue, I never got the plot
any clearer than that.
Anyway, thanks to the hero’s efforts
and their own, the two gangs are
finally wiped out, and the town is
left in the sole possession of the saloon-
. owner —nobody but the hero ever drank
in his cantina anyway —and the over-
worked coffinmaker, while Mr. East-
wood, with the satisfaction of a job
well done, rides off into the distance,
and, I fear, into a sequel.


Music
Man for all styles
By PAUL FROLICH
Charles Glenn. Piano. Conservatorium,
Sydney.
WHEN I FIRST heard young Sydney
pianist Charles Glenn a few weeks
ago, I had a rare impulse to forecast
a brilliant musical career with confi-
dence. On that occasion, in the Cell
Block Theatre, he was just one of
several artists and his contribution to
the evening’s entertainment was rela-
tively minor, but he impressed me
with his considered musical touch, lack
of mannerisms, and pianistic feeling.
A full evening’s recital at the Con-
servatorium, in aid of the Frank
Hutchens Memorial Scholarship Fund,
has caused no second thoughts.
Mr. Glenn has sufficient musician-
ship to appreciate that Bach’s music
was not meant for a modern grand
piano. Playing the Toccata in the
wistful key of C minor, he did not
compromise by trying, in the manner
of so many pianists, to imitate a clave-
cin. Instead, somewhat in the manner
of Rudolf Serkin, he interpreted this
lovely score in the pianistic language
of our own day.
After the Bach, with but a moment’s
break, came Prokofiev’s brilliant sth
Sonata, written in 1923. Musically,
this sonata may almost deserve the
neglect it now suffers, but, taken as a
piano work, it proved well worth hear-
ing again when played so well and
with such gusto.
Brahms’ “Handel” Variations are
certainly not my favorite music and in-
variably seem rather too long. Mr.
Glenn, for this music, adopted a
thoroughly romantic style of pianism
and almost convinced me that I should
try to like the work.
The second half of the recital was
of even greater interest. Opening with
Bartok’s Opus 14, a Suite based on
folk material written in 1916, Mr.
Glenn really got into his pianistic stride.
This is a very complex score and, un-
like the music heard earlier, is largely
percussive. Undaunted, he dealt with
all the work’s intricacies to my full
satisfaction and delight.
Then followed two of Debussy’s im-
probably difficult Etudes and it was
in these that Mr. Glenn gave of his
very best. His ability to produce a true
pianissimo or rippling little sounds is
rare indeed and to hear Debussy played
so idiomatically from other than a
French musician is indeed a rare
event. Here was a sensitivity that a
Gieseking could have been proud of.
Finally, as if to prove that his gigan-
tic undertaking had merely whetted
his appetite, Charles Glenn launched
into Liszt’s monumental “Dante” Fan-
Alexander Hay and Brian James in “Staircaselndependent, Sydney
tasie-Sonata. This is music not lightly
to be undertaken by any but the
greatest virtuosi but Mr. Glenn emerged
unscathed and victorious.

Home, Sweet Home
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Staircase. Charles Dyer. Independent,
Sydney.
WOMEN DOCTORS giving a course
of sex instruction for Sydney school-
girls recently were surprised to find
how much the girls knew about ab-
normal behaviour, learnt from watch-
ing television programs.
The second play in the Independ-
ent’s current repertoire entitled “Three
Views of Love and Marriage” should
help to fill the background to what
every schoolgirl should know about the
homosexual relationship. Not that it is
a serious study of homosexuality any
more than “The Killing of Sister
George” is a serious study of lesbian-
ism. Both are comic entertainments
realistically set in areas of life which
it is fashionably daring to explore at
the present time.
Charles Dyer (the character, not the
author) and Harry C. Leeds (an ana-
gram for the author) are middle-aged
barbers who have shared a menage for
20 years. Two impending events have
thrown the household into a state of
crisis which has them sitting up all
night, Charlie in a state of nerves,
Harry trying to comfort him, both
mulling over the past, bickering and
getting on each other’s nerves. Charlie
is awaiting the arrival of his daughter,
whom he has not seen for 20 years,
and of a police constable with a sum-
mons for importuning in female attire.
It is interesting to note that there is
a certain sameness about domesticity,
no matter how odd the couple, and
especially on the stage. Stage domesti-
city consists, basically, of conversation
ranging from desultory chatter,
through argument, bickering, and nag-
ging, to blazing rows —punctuated by
refreshments and interrupted by knocks
at the door.
The refreshments vary according to
country and social class. Since this is
lower-middle-class England, they drink
a lot of cups of tea. However, as the
night wears on and excoriation sets in,
they move into “Who’s Afraid of Vir-
ginia Woolf?” territory and start drink-
ing gin.
Like Beckett in “Waiting for Godot,”
Charles Dyer, the dramatist, has bor-
rowed from the music-hall for his dia-
logue. Charlie, ex-actor, flashy, still
handsome, is cruelly and amusingly
sharp-tongued, while Harry, motherly
and dignified, but vulnerable, is his
foil. But, whereas Beckett’s comedians
refresh themselves with carrots and
struggle with their shoes in a poet’s
world of infinite space and time, Dyer’s
barber shop is closed, claustrophobic,
and finite.
Reservations about the play aside, it
proves a wonderful vehicle for the
actors. Alexander Hay is excellent as
the actor manque, lashing out to hide
his fright, while Brian James is
astonishingly good as the bulky Harry,
a frustrated mother-figure, brooding
about the stage making cups of tea
and parrying the vicious wit of his
companion.
Pinter Party
By PHILLIP ADAMS
The Birthday Party. Pinter. St. Mar-
tin’s, Melbourne.
“ENCOUNTER” (the ClA’s house
magazine) first brought Pinter to my
attention with a short, short story called
“The Examination.” This literary frag-
ment contained most of the elements
which were to make him famous as a
dramatist. It concerned the possession
of a room occupied by a man suffering


from a bad case of angst. The room is
entered by a mysterious intruder, who
begins to cross-examine and bully the
occupant. The occupant becomes
understandably terrified, and the in-
truder achieves complete dominance.
Finally, possession of the room changes
hands.
Most of these components are found
in most of Pinter’s works. They give
a new dimension to childhood fears of
the bogyman, but for all the brilliance
of the writing, they do little more.
Despite the apparently symbolic red
herrings he invariably introduces, his
plays seem ultimately meaningless, just
consummate technical exercises.
In “The Birthday Party” two Aven-
James Sharman
ger-style baddies come to a quiet
boarding-house and persecute a frail
guest. (They are a Jew and an Irish-
man, members of persecuted races; but
it’s a waste of time to rationalise that
one.) They accuse him of everything
from murder to BO and force him to
attend a surreal birthday party which
drives him to an insane sexual out-
burst. The result is an unforgettable
horror story in Freudian clothing, which
in this instance has been powerfully
produced by Jim Shannan. Sharman
errs throughout on the side of over-
statement, underlining the play’s
loonier moments which incarnadine
lighting and traumatic sound effects,
as if trying to help an audience unfami-
liar with this form of theatre.
His cast is good, with Sheila Florance
playing a simple-minded landlady with
a mixture of Mrs. Everage and Blanche
Dubois, and Sydney Conabere giving a
meticulous performance as her vague
husband. Martin Magee plays the terri-
fied guest with all stops out, while
Peter Adams makes a fair fist of his
first-ever heavy role as chief villain.

The Alcorso-Sekers Scuplture Prize.
Art Gallery of N.S.W., Sydney.
THE ALCORSO-SEKERS sculpture
show with a prize of $2OOO, pre-selected
by State gallery directors and con-
demned in toto by that rabid chauvinist
of Australian art, Laurie Thomas, as
plagiarism (he means that the sculp-
tors are thieves and the gallery direc-
tors fences), was to have been judged
by Arnaldo Pomodoro, but, ill in Milan
Hospital, he could not come. The
very same week he must have been
cheered by the news that he was one
of six equal winners of $2OOO each at
Pittsburgh’s Carnegie International.
In the art world it is more blessed
to receive than to give, but that is
not my moral: at the Carnegie in 1964
the artists wore distinguishing carna-
tions at the opening banquet, but at
the Alcorso-Sekers do at nine p.m. with
champagne and tit-bits, the artists were
distinctive in informal dress while
patrons wore that black tie which could
hardly have gone as nicely with Van
Wieringen’s plastic nude in the bath
and Max Cullen’s Carnaby-colored
swinging phallus, as did Toulouse-
Lautrec’s men in evening dress with
the can-can girls. An establishment
deal indeed, and though a Flugel,
Laver, or McLuhan might throw light
on the persistence of this provincial
apparel and its connection with avant
garde sculpture, it’s clear that being
patronising is not patronage.
So, writing this piece in mufti, I
feel quite at home amid the iron-
clads and wooden hulks; these, com-
pared with the bland, smooth surfaces
of most of the exhibits, resemble ves-
tiges of battles long ago, but Barney
Rahill has a blunt arrangement of flat
steel from which discs have been cut,
Peter Vertegen’s rusty set of impacted
triangles .rise with power and finality
to a still platform, and Max Cullen
arranges in loose, steel calligraphy ele-
ments of the field and smithy. There’s
little wood about, but Bruce Cooper
has a rather formally eroded spheroid
and Elwyn Dennis’ potential winner in
stained wood is a heavy block sup-
ported by both stalwart and tender,
slender strips arising from a base that
is giving birth to broom handles. It
has a play of ease and profundity,
delicacy, and massiveness only found
elsewhere in Jack Clutterbuck’s Shrine
with a silver Brancusi egg placed cn the
side of a beautifully scalloped whitish
grindstone.
These sculptors are concerned with
the life of forms. Those who rely on
color seem to want to set up a dynamic
dichotomy between simple form and
color: Col Jordan’s three pyramids
with wavering bands of color lit with
ultra-violet depend on the illusion of
formal movement; it is no more the
sculpture of internal pressures than is
Kitching’s winning Nevada of fluores-
cent perspex discs lit from within and
suspended from the ceiling. Kitching,
so far, has scored two critical pieces in
praise and two a little non-commital
and, of course, he got two at least of
three votes of judges Missingham,
Dadswell, and Kaldor (one of the pro-
moters). Nevada radiates a subtle,
beneficent aura, like a modern Holy
Grail or a giant piece of Turkish Delight
lit from within, and is attractive, sweet,
decorously glamorous but formally banal
and, with his two additives of silver
tubes and discs, Kitching seems to have
realised this. It certainly lacks the semi-
opaque regions that gave his show
earlier this year at the Hungry Horse
a mysterious radiance.
It is bland confectionery and one
prefers the rather inappropriate acid-
drop color of Wendy Paramor’s Luke ,
a tinsmith’s Stonehenge with two large
enclosing forms with a womb-like
aperture through which you can see
the world go by; it is as symmetrical as
the Kitching, but the tough, three-
dimenisonality prevents complacency.
The color looks imposed and lacks the
inevitability of Noel Dunn’s matt black
on his wedge or shining black on his
set of recumbent, connected chutes in
homage to Caro.
Color-sculptors do set themselves
tough problems, not quite solved with
Nigel Lendon’s series of overlapping,
shallow boxes or Malcolm Peel’s lacer-
ated and bulging Winged Victory still
at war with a mass of painted masonry.
Reticence is more effective in Robert
Parr’s two silvery cornets on a brown
cupboard full of lemons; it recalls that
assemblage-surrealism of Vic Gentils
and how fine were Colin Lanceley’s
assemblages of 1964, as his busted piano
mural in the central court demonstrates.
Along with Elwyn Dennis, it’s the
oddies who are the moral winners: the
massively restless Jomantis I noted a
fortnight ago and the Lush Funk art of
Van Wieringen and Unsworth, both out
of art nouveau by Dada. Unsworth’s
striped gourds on a pink, upholstered
table, support his soft, black vinyl
Kinkiebird; it’s Carnaby art nouveau
made nasty with a pinch of Piche and
puts fun into sculpture’s solemnity.
Van Wieringen’s fun is a bit sick:
art nouveau with a dash of Beardsley,
who has read up on Kraft-Ebbing, for
three suspended children of different
colors (any racists here?) are united by
a common umbilical cord to a vaginal-
shell-soap-holder alongside a plastic
nude in an eroded bath. Here legs be-
come part of the plumbing, disagree-
ably flaccid, as though everything was
made of sweet, nauseating wax. It’s all
about Venus being born and giving
birth and, pace Laurie Thomas, if it’s
indebted to Kienholtz, Van Wieringen
has put his investment to new and
memorable use. It’s an informal work
morally and aesthetically and let’s hope
she distressed all those in formal garb
when she first displayed her beauties.

One of a series, Living is an Art, by
SHEELAH WOOD
MRS. HERVE HUTTER, the former
Australian Maggi Eckardt, one of the
world’s leading models, is now the wife
of the French Trade Commissioner in
Melbourne. She met her husband in
Sydney, married in Paris, and returned
to live in Australia.
They bought a small weatherboard
workman’s cottage with the typical
shooting-gallery hall and rooms opening
off either side. With fantastic energy
and verve they have completely
renovated it themselves.
The credit of the heavy remodelling
of this charming home must be given
to Mr. Hutter. He did the demolishing
himself and only used tradesmen for
plumbing and electrical work. The
Hutters did all the inside and outside
painting themselves. His original ideas
are seen in the cupboards, mantels, and
choice of simple furniture.
The Flutters connected the two
living-rooms into one by opening two
archways and leaving the original fire-
places. On one side they left the wood-
burning fireplace and on the other a
modern oil-burning heater was installed.
The result is a warm and intimate
division, plus a feeling of space and
airiness.
The old kitchen-dresser takes away
the hygienic look which is so boring
in many modern kitchens. Mrs. Hutter
uses the scrubbed top of her dresser
to do her food preparation and finds it
Below, the Hutters connected the two-
living-rooms of the cottage they reno-
vated by knocking down walls
Below right, an old dresser, retrieved
from the wreckers, is Madame
Hutter’s storage cupboard in kitchen


just as efficient as the modem counter-
part. In fact more sympathetic to the
knife!
This is a small house, and Mrs.
Hutter uses one of the bedrooms as a
giant walk-in wardrobe and general
utility room. Here are her hair-dryer,
wiglets on stands, ironing board at the
ready, and sewing machine. I think
most women will envy her this room.
Incidentally, nobody is ever allowed
into this sanctum and it was definitely
not to be photographed. “Far too per-
sonal!” she said.
The dining-room chairs are ordinary
kitchen ones painted a seaweed green.
Very easy to overlook in the junk
shops, but the Hutters saw their poten-
tial and here they are blending per-
fectly with the antique oak dining-room
furniture.
Throughout the house Mrs. Hutter
has used beautiful bouquets of dried
flowers in brilliant colors. She is also
very keen on potted palms, which are
very much in vogue in Europe. She
does not have the time to do elaborate
fresh-flower arrangements and uses plat-

Mrs. Hutter is domesticated in the
true French tradition. She is an excel-
lent cook and a born marketer, never
ordering by telephone. Dinner is her
favorite form of entertaining. She does
not like her husband to help her in the
kitchen, considering this her province.
They have their own cellar and never
serve any but French wines. Her hus-
band is in charge of this department.
The shopping and main preparation for
a dinner are done the day before.
They invite their guests at 7.30 for
8 o’clock and expect them to be on
time. They serve an aperitif of
champagne or Dubonnet but no savories.
The food is always presented at the
table, as she considers this offers the
guest a choice and opportunity to
appreciate the eye appeal of her dishes.
Some of these, such as some casseroles,

Below, Mrs. Hutter’s table set for dinner in the French manner. Mrs. Hutter does
not have time to do flower arrangements, so substitutes fruit-and-vegetable platters


so that they may mature in their sauces.
She adores the big markets of Mel-
bourne and is a genius at transforming
herself into the appearance of the
everyday housewife. You would never
recognise her as she strolls up and
down the stalls searching for bargains
for her home, kitchen, and personal
wardrobe. This last item is always an
original “Maggi look.” She has a
trained eye for the unusual and
original in clothing or accessory. She
became adept at this when she lived in
Paris. All the models she knew ex-
plored the Flea market for beautiful bits
of old embroidery, jewellery, and even
old dresses which they would remodel.
Maggi is herself an expert dressmaker
and makes many of her own clothes.

SOUFFLE AUX CHAMPIGNONS
Ingredients: Half a pound of mush-
rooms, 3 tablespoons of butter, 1
teaspoon of chopped onion, 3 table-
spoons of flour, cups of milk, 4
egg-yolks, 5 egg-whites, salt, cayenne
pepper, nutmeg.
Method: Clean the mushroom caps
and stems, and chop' very finely. Put

add onion, and cook until the onion
is soft, but not brown. Add the chopped
mushrooms and slowly cook all the
moisture out of them.
In another saucepan melt 2 table-
spoons butter, add the flour, and cook
until the flour starts to turn golden.
Add the milk, heated, and cook, stirring
constantly with a wire whisk, for about
5 minutes or until the sauce is reduced
to one cup. Season with one teaspoon
of salt, a little cayenne, and a little
grated nutmeg: add the mushrooms,
bring to the boil, and remove from
the heat. Beat the egg-yolks slightly, put
a little of the hot sauce into them to
heat them, then turn this back into the
remaining sauce mixture. Cool slightly.
Beat the egg-whites stiff but not dry,
and fold them in gently.
Fill a buttered souffle dish about f
full and bake in a moderately hot oven

in seasoned flour, pressing it in firmly
with your hands. Skin and slice
almonds. Heat up the butter slowly in
a pan, large enough, if possible, to hold
all the trout without overlapping; if
not, use two. When the butter is
bubbling put the trout in and let them
brown for 4 minutes on each side. Put
them in the oven to keep hot. Place
the pan back on the stove, heat up the
butter until it is a deepish gold, and
then throw in the almonds and saute
until they are golden, tossing them
about so that they all color equally.
When the almonds are done, pour the
wine over them, heat up, and pour
almonds and wine over the trout.

BOOKS
Four weeks in Vietnam with
the dice loaded
By DONALD HORNE
Vietnam. Mary McCarthy. Weiden-
feld and Nicholson. $3.50 (airmail
stock), $2.80 (seamail stock).
WITH PREDICTABLE honesty
Mary McCarthy begins by admitting
that in the four weeks she spent in
Vietnam last February she was “look-
ing for material damaging to the
American interest.” She is one of
those Americans who use the Vietnam
War as a way of finding metaphors for
the inadequacies they find in contem-
porary American life. It is not just
American policies and behaviour in
Vietnam she attacks, but contemporary
America itself, the realities of which
Mary McCarthy. .. "French leave”
confront its own dreams. She is seek-
ing that state of innocence that was
invented by 18th-century European
writers but became one of the charac-
teristics of Americans. In this sense,
her little book should be taken as an
extended metaphor rather than as a
contribution to the analysis of policy.
As such it is brilliantly bitchy,
sharply aware of the absurdities that
come from a contrast between aspira-
tion and reality. The reporting of any
other war, of course, would produce
much the same result. Toward the
end of her book Mary McCarthy even
castigates the Americans for making
military blunders, as if this were a
special characteristic of Americans
rather than of warfare itself, yvhich is
of necessity compounded of' blunders.
Here is the main point. Mary Mc-
Carthy is describing the disillusions of
action, but to round it out she needed
four weeks with the Viet Cong, too.
Then she could have been bitchy about
them as well. And she might then have
been able to begin to make that
kind of choice between various un-
satisfactory situations that is the
absurd reality of decision-making. As
it is, she just loads the dice, as, of
course, do some of the pro-Americans.
It is true that by their Vietnam action
the Americans are soiling themselves.
Almost all carrying out of policy into
action is a dirty business, and wars, or
other types of action necessarily depend-
ing on brutality, can be the dirtiest of
all. An American boy who simply stayed
at home might be leading an indivi-
dually better life than he does when
going out to Vietnam to kill. When one
human kills another he kills part of
himself. But things do not proceed so
easily that we can keep our lives pure
by avoiding action. One does not neces-
sarily stop killing . and brutality by
avoiding them. It sometimes makes
sense for a nation to degrade itself by
killing to avoid some even greater
degradation of our species. It is true
that if a good man engages in action he
destroys part of his goodness. But it is
also true that by avoiding an action
that might reduce the degradation of
other men a good man can also destroy
his goodness.
One of the extraordinary characteris-
tics of the Vietnam War is that Ameri-
cans are free to read and see on their
TV sets some of the horrors of the
events they are to support, as well as
some of the horrors they are to attack.
This is the context of Mary McCarthy’s
book. It is doubly one-sided —one-sided
because it is concerned only with the
Americans and not with the Viet Cong
and also one-sided because it slants
everything against the Americans. But
it provides a necessary part of the evi-
dence.
Where it becomes frivolous is as a
political analysis—as an analysis of
available choices. Most of it has the
honesty of a confessedly prejudiced
observer, but the last chapter is simply
an example of political and moral
laziness. In answer to the political
question What is to be done? Mary
McCarthy simply replies Pull out. She
says quite rightly that most of the
American opponents of the war are not
final opponents of it—that they do not
support a simple pull-out but some
manoeuvre for ending the war. As a
hardliner she then distinguishes her-
self from them by saying that she
doesn’t care how the Americans pull
cut, or what the results are. It’s
just a question of out they go, the
quicker the better. The administrative
problems of winding up the war should
be left to those who have been waging
it. What happens is their business,
not Mary McCarthy’s.
To dramatise her point she comes
up with an example that illustrates
her fundamental thoughtlessness. She
says: “We could still, if we wished,/
take ‘French leave’ of Vietnam, and
how this should be done ought not
to be the concern of those who oppose
our presence there. When the French
schoolteachers and intellectuals of the
Committee of 121 insisted that France
get out of Algeria, they did not supply
de Gaulle with a ten-point program
telling him how to do it. That was
de Gaulle’s business. He was respon-
sible, not they. As intellectuals they
confronted their Government with an
unequivocal moral demand . . .”
What is illuminating about this is
that she equates Algeria with Vietnam.
This compares a purely colonialist war
with a war that cannot seriously be
described simply as a colonialist war,
but what is more significant about
the comparison is that it ignores the
different geo-political environment of
Vietnam and Algeria. It ignores al-
together the possible effects in the
rest of South-East Asia of an abrupt
American pull-out, effects of a kind
that did not have to be taken into
account in ending the French vileness
in Algeria. Perhaps, like many other
opponents of the Vietnam War, Mary
McCarthy simply doesn’t care what
happens to South-East Asia.
True greatness
By A. J. P. TAYLOR
Winston S. Churchill Vol 2. Ran-
dolph Churchill. Heinemann. $B.OO.
WINSTON CHURCHILL had many
careers, so various that he seemed to
be not one but all mankind’s epitome.
His most brilliant, until his belated
rise to supreme power in World War
11, was before 1914, when he was


second only to Lloyd George among
Radical leaders.
There was a profound difference be-
tween the two champions. George’s
Radicalism was in his blood; he could
not shake it off even if he tried.
Churchill’s Radicalism sprang from
his pugnacity. It was provoked in him
by the opposition of others and by his
own tempestuousness of phrase.
Asquith said: “Winston thinks with his
mouth.” It would be truer to say that
Churchill often went where his mouth,
and still more, his pen, carried him.
His Radicalism, like all his other feel-
ings, was sincere. But there some-
thing odd about a Radical who denoun-
ced dukes during the week and spent
his weekends at Blenheim.
Five volumes of biography are a
heavy prospect even for the most
devoted admirer of Chuchill’s, and in
this volume there are times when the
interest flags. Compared to its pre-
decessor, it contains comparatively little
of a personal nature. Churchill was
now less close to his mother, who pro-
vided him with little except money
difficulties. In 1908 he found lasting
happiness in his marriage with Miss
Clementine Hozier.
The reader will be glad to learn
that Diana Churchill, when a baby,
Winston Churchill, 1901 and 1909... pugnacity
was ■ known as the Puppy Kitten, and
Randolph, most appropriately, as the
Chum Bolly.
However, it is politics that we want
to hear about, and there is plenty of
material, not all of it novel.
Randolph Churchill’s comments are
not always felicitous. Thus, on the
failure to consider the vote for Africans
in 1906, he remarks: “It has only been
in much later times that it has been
thought desirable and profitable to
accord the franchise to people who
cannot read or write.” Again, he dis-
misses Churchill’s opposition in 1908
to the building of more battleships with
the slighting phrase: “On foreign policy
he took the same wrong-headed posi-
tion as other Radicals on the Left and
in the Liberal Party.” Later, he
attributes to Churchill a clear grasp of
Germany’s threat to the Balance of
Power. In fact, Churchill was less con-
sistent. Even in 1914 he thought Anglo-
German hostility rested on misunder-
standing, and believed that all could
be put right if he had a talk with
Tirpitz an episode which Randolph
Churchill ignores.
Often he brings new information and
illumination, as much from anecdotes
as from the written record. He shows
that Campbell-Bannerman did not alone
swing the Cabinet to immediate self-
government for the Transvaal. Chur-
chill’s persistent memoranda aided the
process. Lloyd George supplied a
remarkable story of how the Cabinet
accepted his land taxes. Asquith went
round (the table and, according to
Lloyd George, “everyone spoke against
them, including your father.” Asquith
then said: “We have had a very full
and frank expression of opinion from
every member of the Cabinet and it
seems to me that the weight of the
argument rests with the Chancellor.”
There is another picture of Asquith
of a less creditable kind. On April
22, 1911, Churchill wrote to his wife:—
On Thursday night the PM was vy
bad: and I squirmed with embarrass-
ment. He could hardly speak: and
many people noticed his condition. He
continues most friendly and
benevolent, & entrusts me
with everything after din-
ner. Up till that time he is
at his best—but therafter! It
is an awful pity, & only the
persistent freemasonry of
the House of Commons
prevents a scandal.
Churchill’s Radical ac-
tivities are carefully des-
cribed, but in somewhat
muted vein. There is not
enough emphasis on his
creation of unemployment
insurance, though this is,
perhaps, as much Lloyd
George’s doing as the
author’s. Irish affairs are
treated in a separate
chapter, detached from
Churchill’s work at the
Admiralty, though the two
were happening at the same
time. Churchill’s plan for
disarming Ulster, which provoked the
Curragh mutiny, was in part an attempt
to restore the Radical reputation which
he had forfeited by his demand for
more battleships. On his last great dis-
pute in the Liberal Cabinet, there is a
striking story from Lady Megan Lloyd
George. Her father had resisted the Ad-
miralty program. He invited Churchill
to breakfast and greeted him with the
words:
Oddly enough, my wife spoke to me
last night about this Dreadnought busi-
ness. She said, “You know, my dear, I
never interfere in politics; but they say
you are having an argument with that
nice Mr. Churchill about building
Dreadnoughts. Of course, I don’t under-
stand these things, but I should have
thought it would be better to have too
many rather than too few.” So I have
decided to let them build them. Let’s
go in to breakfast.
Perhaps things really happened like
that.
By August, 1914, Churchill had
brought the Royal Navy to full fighting-
pitch, or so he thought wrongly, as
events proved. His last thoughts before
he became a war-leader were charac-
teristically conflicting. On July 28,
1914, he wrote to his wife:—
Everything tends towards catas-
trophe and collapse. I am inter-
ested, geared up & happy. Is it
not horrible to be built like that?
The preparations have a hideous
fascination for me. I pray to God
to forgive me for such fearful moods
of levity. Yet Iwddo my best
for peace, & nothing wd induce
me wrongfully to strike the
blow. . . .
You know how willingly &
proudly I wd risk or give if
need be—my period of existence to
keep this country great & famous
& prosperous & free. But the
problems are vy difficult. One has
to try to measure the indefinite
& weigh the imponderable.
In such passages as these Churchill
transcended his erratic impulses and
revealed his true greatness.
Wartime Sydney
By MARIA WOLKOWSKY
Tell Morning This. Kylie Tennant.
Angus and Robertson. $3.75.
IN 1943 KYLIE TENNANT was so
bent on obtaining local color for this
novel that she deliberately abused a
policeman in order to land where she
wanted in jail. ‘The Law having
kindly obliged, the many behind-the-
bars episodes in “Tell Morning This”
are chillingly realistic, and even the
strange prison jargon has a convincing
ring. Few writers would dare to carry
authenticity this far, but it is a typical
example of Miss Tennant’s zeal, sin-
cerity, and passionate attention to
detail.
It took 24 years for this first com-
plete edition to appear (an abridged
version, “The Joyful Condemned,”
came out 14 years ago), yet the writ-
ing has stood this formidable time-test
extremely well it is as fresh and
unstuffy as the day it was written and
still surprisingly topical in content. In
fact, time has actually lent a more
sympathetic aura to figures like the
conscientious objector David Aumbry,
a medical student who goes to jail
rather than go to war; to unmarried
mothers like Marie and young aban-
doned girls like Big Rene, with no
choice, whatever the moralists say, be-
tween prison and prostitution; and to
the tragic Terry Lago, whose wrong
conviction to life imprisonment for a

murder she did not commit seems all
too plausible.
All the same, the real heroine of the
novel is Sydney in wartime, in all its
natural beauty and man-made ugliness,
flinging its doors wide open to the
delirious invasion of all those orchid-
happy, money-throwing Yanks, its
determinedly feverish nightlife, its
slums, pubs, and posh fringe-racketeers.
Literarily speaking, Sydney has a very
elusive atmosphere, as many an author
has sadly discovered, but Miss Tennant
has succeeded in pinning down a large
slice of it on paper, from Woolloomoo-
loo to Bellevue Hill, from Palm Beach
to Kings Cross.
The novel teems with characters and
it is probably inevitable that the bawdy,
colorful types seem to come alive and
clamor for attention more easily than
the, sober ordinary citizens. This is an
enormous canvas with plenty of crowd-
scenes in which a boisterous young
“professional” in tight grey slacks and
crimson satin blouse and an exuber-
antly matching personality is more
likely to catch the reader’s eye than a
prim little mouse-girl from the best
suburb.
There are complex plots and counter-
plots, the long arm of coincidence
brings people together in a way that
Kylie Tennant.. . social comment
fiction-writers now tend to avoid but
that life ironically goes on doing; there
are mysteries, murders (past and
present), an attempted kidnapping, and
lots of good sound social comment so
deftly woven together that, although the
message gets across, there is never any
feeling of soapbox oratory or prosely-
tising about any of it. Yet there is no
doubt where the author’s sympathies lie
not with the reformers, the do-
gooders, the social ladies, but with
what she calls “the rat people.” They
may be forced to live in cellars, they
may have different values, but to her
they seem more real.
Perhaps the most important point
this novel has to make is summed up
in a quiet conversation between a
famous refugee doctor and the medical
student. It concerns the relationship
between the human body and the crim-
inal mind, the possible connection be-
tween the glandular system and the
personality. Perhaps habitual crimin-
ality will one day be found to be a
compulsive disease, curable like many
others, not by jail but by medicine.
It is a fascinating theory.
Poet as mimic
By VIVIAN SMITH
Grendel. Roland Robinson. Jacaranda.
$3.
IT IS NOW five years since “Deep
Well” appeared, and the 35 poems
in “Grendel” show Roland Robinson at
an important crossroads in his poetic
development. Essentially a poet of
vision, he has had to make the transi-
tion from vision to technique, which
every poet must make if he is to find
consistent sources of inspiration and re-
newal. “Grendel” shows continuity and
change; it looks forward and backward,
and is to be welcomed both for what
it offers and for what it promises.
Robinson has always drawn strength
from his intense love for the Australian
outback and for the Aborigines. Many
of his poems are on Aboriginal themes,
and in the section “Yoola and the
Seven Sisters” he continues his ballad-
like, semi-narrative renderings of
Aboriginal stories and legends. There
is an attractive simplicity about these
pieces, and dramatic force in poems
such as “Yoola” and “Jarrangulli”; but
their appeal may in the end be extra-
poetic, with Robinson as transmitter
rather than original artist.
Other sections show Roland Robin-
son’s strength in dealing with landscape
in terms of the psyche always a
striking feature of his work while
“Curracarong Creek,” a section of seven
delicate nature lyrics, shows him intensi-
fying his poetry through the use of
alliteration:
Root-clasped, clamped to lichened
rocks,
red mauve and grey mauve gums lean
out
in arching gestures over the pool.
Day’s
ending mutes the mood of gums, the
rocks,
the glass-still pool . . .
It is always good to see a writer
breaking new ground and taking tech-
nical risks, and perhaps the poems of
most interest in this respect are
“modernised” lyrics like “Concert” and
“Roses”: “The vase of pale yellow
roses/white vase with gold, brocade/
markings, standing on the marble/side-
board, next to the racketing/television,
suddenly becoming/a woman . . .” Even
more achieved, however, is the in-
dividuality and wit of “Lyre Bird”—a
poem which synthesises the interests
and concerns of Robinson’s earlier and
most recent poetry, and sums up what

Books in brief
Quick-frozen moods
Some Gorgeous Accident. James Ken-
naway. Longmans. $3.15.
WHILE SO MANY authors trip over
themselves in their desire to make the
commonplace appear profound, James
Kennaway seems to make a specialty
of taking the profound and tilting it
so far that it appears commonplace. He
deliberately throws away all his best
lines, one by one, like some egghead
who has wandered happily into a TV
commercial, and throughout the novel
employs a language so “hip” that it
is already dating like yesterday. How-
ever, if by this he is trying to capture
the elusive mood of the passing moment
to be quick-frozen for future refer-
ence, he succeeds admirably.
The plot (although the author main-
tains there is none) centres on the
relationship of two men, a doctor and
a photographer, with one girl, and with
each other. The masculine friendship
has only a hidden undertow of barely
acknowledged homosexuality; in con-
trast all the heterosexual antics are made
crudely Henry Millerish. In a fit of
jealous pique, Jim Link first starts a
case against his friend Dr. Fiddes for
alleged criminal abortion and then tries
to withdraw it, only to find that the
doctor is bent on continuing his own
public crucifixion.
Somewhere underneath this convul-
sive jig lurks Goethe’s familiar “Zwei
Seelen” (two souls in one breast) or,
more recently, the duality of “The
Solid Mandala’s” twin men who are
two halves of the same whole. In
Kennaway’s case it becomes Mr. Jekyll
and Dr. Hyde when, in one decisive
scene, Link and Fiddes take on each
other’s characteristics and become
interchangeable.
The style is individual. It is not
film-script writing, as it has been
called, nor are the headlines that keep
on breaking into the pages in italics
merely gimmickry. They act partly as
pointers to the real trend of thought,
partly as short-cuts: “All nothing. Gor-
geous nothing . . . The Night-Spot
. . . An Invitation to a Party,” etc.
Taken as a whole “Some Gorgeous
Accident” is a near miss that almost
comes off. Perhaps the next book will.
“Decadent” Soviet novel
The Holy Well. Valentin Katayev. Col-
lins. $2.65.
SOVIET NOVELIST Valentin Kata-
yev’s brilliant new novel not only
attacks the gobbledegook of writing to
regulation, lashes out at Stalin’s inter-
ference with artists and holds Khrush-
chev up to ridicule, but even more dar-
ingly ignores the prescribed “socialist
realism and employs a “decadent”
contemporary way-out stele of its own.
It has no conventional plot at all—
disembodied fragments from a life-story
drift past the reader. it is a galaxy
of thoughts with an innate (although
not easily recognisable) order.
Using the device of an anaesthetised
sleep during a serious operation, the
narrator floats off into space in “a
search for lost time” where clocks,
gravity, and other inflexible rules have
no meaning. The foreword calls it a
Fellini film-technique, the author ironic-
ally names it “mauvisme” (from
“mauvais,” bad), but it might rather be
described as a form of literary Chagal-
lism.
Ihe fantastic, dazzling colors, the
recurring motifs like the six-winged
seraphim, the pink angel-feathers, the
candies, the never-never flowers, the
talking-cat, and the personal identi-
fication with objects could be straight
out of any painting by "Chagall. The
common root is obvious—it springs
from the same sophisticated, yet, in the
best sense, child-like imagination, deeply
steeped in the early psychology of
Russian folk-lore.
The vision of the old man at the
“Holy Well” (a real place near Kiev)
forever washing out differently shaped
bottles that he draws from the bottom-
less sack of eternity is, of course,
heavily symbolic. So, in a different
way, is the talking-cat that dies after
a banquet in Georgia while trying to
mouth yet another party-line slogan,
“neo-colonialism.”
The cat is the writer himself or
perhaps all Russian writers who had
for so long been made painfully and
humiliatingly to learn their lessons.
Katayev had been forced to rework
his "for the Power of the Soviets” be-
cause it did not conform (Ist version
1948, 2nd version 1951) and Alexander
Fadeyev Suicided after his similar
“Young Guard” scandal.
"The Holy Well” is the outcry of
an angry old man shouting a memorial
for his lost generation. Katayev
achieved fame as long ago as 1928 for
his play “The Squaring of the Circle”;
he encouraged young original talent like
Yevtushenko until relieved of the editor-
ship of “Youth” magazine, but this is
his first novel in many years.


MARION RAYMOND’S
COOKBOOK
Dressing a
salad: like
dressing a woman
THERE ARE THREE things guaran-
teed to put me off a recipe book
quicker than anything else that I know.
One is combining a number of ingre-
dients with a whacking great dollop
of mayonnaise. The next is advice to
“mix two-thirds of olive oil with one-
third of vinegar.” And the last —and
to me the most offensive of all —is
reading about adding a sprinkle of
sugar to a french dressing. Ugh!
A salad is not hard to make but
easy to wreck. Dressing a salad is like
dressing a woman. What is to be
covered has a great deal to do with
what you put on.
It is a great sadness to me that in a
country where almost everything grows
so prolifically the English cos lettuce is
virtually unknown. Its tall, delicate
leaves are crisp and flavorsome from the
outer leaves to the heart.
The lettuce most commonly eaten
here is what I know as the iceberg.
It is crisp, but has very little flavor.
As a consequence, it really needs a
bit of jazzing up to bring out its
better qualities. Curly endive lettuce
makes a pleasant variation. Romain,
I am happy to say, can be found if
you look hard. Recognise it by its
long wide leaves, with the slightly
bubbled surface. It grows upwards and
is closed rather like Belgian endive
(sometimes known as witloof). I have
even found romana in the markets; it
has short, squat leaves, thicker and
coarser than some, and is usually sold
in bunches of three or six.
For a simple salad then, to munch
between the main event and the finale,
I prepare my dressing well in advance.
A crushed clove or two of garlic is
placed into a screw-topped jar. This
is covered with four or five parts of
olive oil and one part of vinegar. (In
a glass jar it is easy to see how far up
each of these ingredients should go.)
Add half a teaspoon of coarse salt and
a good grating of black peppercorns
straight into the jar. Screw the top
down well, give it a very good shake,
and set aside to mature until required.
Shake again before using. Never, never
pour the dressing on until immediately
before it is required, or the leaves will
lose their crispness.
I prefer to use tarragon vinegar, or
basil-flavored vinegar. But always white
or wine vinegar never malted vinegar
for a salad. Sometimes I add a few
finely chopped chives to the tossed
salad, some sprigs of watercress, pieces
of avocado, or finely chopped parsley.
Onions, tomatoes, radishes, cucum-
bers, and beets are far better served
separately, with their own dressing.
Caesar salad invented simul-
taneously, if you can believe the vari-
ous claims, in about a dozen different
restaurants from Mexico City to Naples
is something rather special.
To make it you should really use a
cos lettuce, but any will do, if broken
into fairly big pieces. Combine the
juice of one lemon with a finely
chopped clove of garlic and a teaspoon
of Worcestershire sauce. Add sufficient
french dressing for the size of your
salad and a coddled egg (lightly
boiled). Whisk until well blended.
Just before serving your salad, fry
some small cubes of bread with a couple
of chopped-up fillets of anchovy, and
toss in with your lettuce. Sprinkle well
with parmesan cheese and freshly
ground black pepper. Pour on the
dressing and toss until each leaf is well
coated with dressing.
Beetroot salad, to be served with cold
meat, can be something very special.
But not with the beets you purchase in
a tin. Buy your beets and bake them in
the oven, just as you bake potatoes.
Prick them with a toothpick to find out
when they are ready. (Boil them and
you lose the flavor.) When cool, peel,
and slice thinly into a bowl. Toss with
french dressing and sprinkle with
caraway seeds. Leave to marinate.
When ready to eat, fry one large onion,
thinly sliced, until golden. Then toss it
into your salad butter and all.
For something really different try
courgettes (sometimes called zucchini).
Blanch eight of them (3in. to 4in. long)
in salt water for about eight minutes.
Cut them in half lengthwise and care-
fully scoop out the seeds. Cut side up,
place into a flat dish. Chop one onion
very finely with one clove garlic and
sprinkle on to courgettes. Splash with
french dressing and marinate for at
least three hours. When required remove
onion and garlic and drain off mari-
nade. Place them on individual lettuce
leaves anu fill the hollows with very
finely chopped capsicums, tomatoes,
and capers. Add fresh dressing, salt,
and freshly ground black pepper.
Salade Nicoise belongs to the more
substantial fare, and here all is fair
in love and war. It consists of quar-
tered tomatoes, sliced onion, sliced
capsicum, a handful of sliced radishes,
celery, lettuce hearts all mixed up
with a tin of tuna, some anchovy fil-
lets, a couple of hard-boiled eggs quar-
tered, and a handful of olives. Make
your french dressing with basil-flav-
ored vinegar, serve cold with meat, and
you have a complete meal in minutes.
The subject of salads is an unend-
ing story. Whatever you toss, however,
I beg you to remember: do beware of
the vinegar.

Hurrahs for Hayes Gordon
Your theatre critic Phillip Adams
(8., Nov. 11) might know a few
Yiddish phrases, but when it comes to
“Fiddler on the Roof” his judgments
are those of a goyisher kop. His
mistake, shared with at least one other
Melbourne theatre critic and casually
repeated by some Jews who wouldn’t
know the difference between Sholem
Aleichem and Shelley Berman, is his
misleading comparison between Max
Bruch and Hayes Gordon.
Bruch plays Lazar Wolf, the butcher,
and Hayes Gordon the lead, Tevye.
Mr. Adams writes: “But every time
Max Bruch is on stage the idiomatic
inadequacies of Gordon and the rest
of the cast become obvious . . . beside
Bruch they tend to look like so many
insipid shlemiels.”
There may be some point to the
comparison when made with other
members of the cast. Some of the
female roles, for instance, are so misun-
derstood and played so hopelessly that
the impact of some scenes is lost com-
pletely. But when it comes to Bruch
and Gordon, it is Bruch who suffers
from “idiomatic inadequacies.” True,
Bruch is a. Jewish actor (Jewish but
not Yiddish) and Gordon is not. Bruch
has given some first-rate performances
in various roles. But his playing of
Lazar Wolf in “Fiddler” is as wrong as
Gordon’s Tevye is right. What makes
the difference is precisely Gordon’s
combination of intonation and gesture
that Mr. Adams finds lacking in many
of the players.
The idiom of “Fiddler” is supposed
to be that of Sholem Aleichem’s Yid-
dish, East European, small village, turn
of the century. Bruch’s Lazar Wolf is
Viennese Jew, urban and very 1967.
This is wonderful in a play like “Come
Blow Your Horn.” It is all wrong in
“Fiddler.” The two worlds of Sholem
Aleichem and Max Bruch are very far
apart. It is as if a stage Irishman had
found himself playing in Dylan
Thomas’ “Under Milkwood” and had
forgotten to change his brogue.
Hayes Gordon, on the other hand,
surprised with his fidelity of idiomatic
gesture. In some scenes his Hebrew
prayers and small mannerisms were un-
canny.
Beyond his wrong-headed compari-
son, Mr. Adams seems to be saying
something more about the role of Tevye,
which raises an interesting argument.
Unless I misread him he was suggest-
ing that only a Jew could play a great
Tevye.
In 1966 I saw the Tel Aviv produc-
tion of “Fiddler” in Hebrew with one


of the great veterans of the Israeli
theatre, Shmuel Rodzansky in the role
of Tevye. Rodzansky, born in Russia,
gave a towering performance which
rose far above the writing and the rest
of the cast. Critics and audience alike
raved for weeks.
The interesting thing to me was that
before Rodzansky the role had been
taken by a native-born Israeli star,
J. Bomba Tsur, who failed as Tevye
because, although Jewish, he just could
not grasp the Yiddish idiom of “the
shtetl” the village in Eastern
Europe. .Somehow Hayes Gordon has
found the idiom, but, more importantly,
he has given Tevye character, and,
like Rodzansky in Israel, often more
character than the writing deserves.
Like some others, I was worried about
whom JCW would choose to play Tevye.
Some of the early rumors sounded as
if we would end up with a cross be-
tween Fagin and Lenny Bruce. Luckily
we got Hayes Gordon and a great
Tevye.

Art values and dealers
I recall one day in 1951 going to an
art gallery in Paris and seeing Geoi'ges
Braque standing alone among a single
exhibition of his work, which in the
auction rooms today would undoubtedly
fetch £1 million sterling. The price of
a good Jackson Pollock, like the work
of some other U.S. painters who have
come into prominence in the past
decade, would be rushed at £lOO,OOO
on the international market.
For over ten years there has been
a quiet but determined effort to auction
the work of some of our more noted
Australians at Christies and Sotheby’s
in London and at the Parke-Bernet
galleries in New York. The highest bid
for all that time has been £6OO sterling.
Australian dealers may have a reason
for such crash devaluation; but, back
here, the promotion, loud as it may be,
is far too idiosyncratic. Nowhere in the
world is it possible to have solid and
permutated art price values where the
location of private galleries are strung
out three miles apart, each in a dif-
ferent dingy suburb -well outside the
city limits.

Devaluing sterling
“Where sterling goes Australia won’t
go, too” (8., Nov. 4) is a subject
on which no Government could afford
to reveal its intentions, but there can
be no harm in outsiders discussing the
pros and cons of the situation.
Not everyone would agree with the
senior Government man that the
economy is in a fundamentally healthy
state, and the view which he has ex-
pressed that there are no long-term
balance-of-payments problems is some-
thing of a platitude. After all, Austra-
lia does not need to export to eat, and
no country is likely to sell us more than
we can pay for. We cannot import
more than we export, no matter what
the rate of exchange may be.
With regard to the health of the
economy, there can be no doubt that a
REVALUATION of 20 percent of the
Australian currency coupled with an
adequate rise in tariff protection would
make Australian exporters less healthy
to the extent of about s6oom. per year
at the present time and the health of
the rest of the community would be
raised by an equivalent amount.
Conversely, an adjustment in the
opposite direction could enable the
health of the export industries to be
brought more into line with the health
of the rest of the economy. It is not
quite true to say that woolgrowers are
the only snag.
At the present time, manufactured
units which are exported provide little
better than half the returns from a
unit sold on the local market. Any
adjustment to our tariffs and exchange
rate which raised the health of the
wool industry would be a step in the
direction of Australia becoming a large
exporter of manufactured goods. Ster-
ling devaluation would appear to pro-
vide a suitable opportunity for making
such adjustments.

The RAAF's role
I question the basic premise of your
article “Is the RAAF misundei'stood?”
(8., Oct. 21) and of the letters con-
cerning it (8., Nov. 11). In that is an
Air Force as a separate service really
necessary?
The Army could and should operate
its own troop support aircraft, as the
U.S. Army does. Given this, there is
no reason why the Army could not
operate its own interceptor, strike, re-
connaissance, transport aircraft, or its
own anti-aircraft, missile, and VIP
units.
The majority of Air Force operations
are conducted for the Army, in con-
junction with the Army, for the Army’s
tactical and strategic benefit.
Why not have the Army do ii itself?
And if the Army can do that, then it
could easily operate aircraft for the
defence of our nation, industrial mili-
tary complexes, and for the destruction
of our enemies.
The Navy could operate its own land-
based anti-submarine aircraft as does
the USN (from which the RAAF buys
its anti-sub aircraft). The Navy has
its own carrier force anti-sub aircraft
and amphibious troop support aircraft
and is soon to complement its aging
air arm with more modern aircraft.
Why is it necessary for an Air Force
(RAAF) to operate complementary air-
craft? Why not give the Navy complete
control?
Effective naval air arms do not re-
quire huge expensive super carriers,
since V/TOL technology will soon
allow highly sophisticated weapons
platforms to operate from Melbourne-
size carriers.
The effect of merging the RAAF
with its applicable Service sisters? To
reduce the defence bureaucracy, reduce
the chain of command and liaison be-
tween complementary operations.
This would be an increase in our
military effectiveness, and an economy
in the reduction of defence bureaucracy.

Defending the CMF
Peter Samuel’s .article “How We
Could Raise 100,000 Soldiers”
(8., Nov. 11) stated that some 1100 of
the Regular Army are at present tied
up with the CMF. But it then failed
to continue and give the number of
CMF who are serving throughout the
Army on full-time service. It also bailed
to mention that up until the rapid
expansion caused by the current
National Service, the CMF provided
a valuable training ground for those
regulars associated with it.
The statement that the CMF is a
haven for draft-dodgers was far more
objectionable and misleading enough to
be deliberate. It should be noted in
repudiation of the draft-dodging claim
that the CMF prior to National Service
was comprised entirely of volunteers of
all ages, who gave and continue to
give unstintingly of their time, often
to the detriment of civilian and ‘family
commitments. The CMF still has only
a very small percentage of people tak-
ing this form of National Service.
“Knockers” of the CMF would do
well to remember that throughout the
length and breadth of Australia count-
less memorials stand mute testimony
to the sacrifices of citizen soldiers made
in the defence of Australia when this
country had no significant Regular
Army.

"Isaac Isaacs"
May I correct an error in my review
of Zelman Cowen’s “Isaac Isaacs” (8.,
Nov. 18) in which the line reading “it
is rarely a history of Australia” should
have read “it is really a history of
Australia”—almost the opposite?
