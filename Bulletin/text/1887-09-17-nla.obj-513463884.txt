SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 17, 1887.
collar-and-Cuffs Morality.
That infernally thick-skulled and grossly
blockish bourgeois estimate of life and of
social organisation which people have learned
to associate with those unphilosophical and
densely Philistinish journals, the Sydney
D.T. and S.M. Herald, is again and again
plethorically exemplified by inane, albeit
conceited, journalistic flapdoodle served out
by the yard on questions which have severely
taxed the powers of a Charles Darwin or
of a Herbert Spencer. Never yet have
these “ respectable" compilations of diurnal
dullness, these philomaths of moral fiddle-
faddle, touched a social question without the
unvarying vapidness and blatant back-par-
lour and Sunday-school board-room twaddle
inseparably connected with the names of
these organs of the mighty mediocrity of
well-to-do Bottoms and Dogberrys. These
papers manage—apparently with no very
supernal effort—to grovel along in the in-
tellectual dust so favourable to the mental
and ethic obtuseness of their prosperous and
coatse-ner fed clientele. The other day the
S.M. Herald sang softly, and sweetly, and
sapiently, and Christianly, and according to
its limited theological lights,, anent the
wickedness of permitting “ unmarried
mothers” to endure the racking pangs of
child-birth in the same sacred atmosphere
as the matrimonially parson-blessed and
finger-with-wedding-ring-encircled women.
This gave the pulpit-weighted paper a
chance to utter a great many highly moral
and truly edifying Ker-istian precepts which
cannot fail to do good—as good is under-
stood from the standpoint of the Congrega-
tionalism dissenting trader.
♦ * *
Now the Sydney D.T.—which seems to
emulate the part of Square to the Herald’s
Thwackum, the one tooting the theological
trumpet while the other twangs the moral
jew’s-harp—takes up the pious theme and
discourseth thus humanely :
“ The police of the city are now displaying
praiseworthy zeal in hunting down inhuman
mothers who abandon their infant offspring.”
Memory of the woman whom Christ com-
mended to go her way aqd sin no more ! the
police ate applauded in the columns of an
alleged intelligent newspaper in this age of al-
leged enlightenment for their “praiseworthy
zeal in hunting down ”, —mark that, hv/nting
down —unfortunate creatures whose crime is
too often forced upon them by the self-
satisfied, smirking, blastedly self-righteous,
superciliously virtuous agglomerate called
“ (Society ” of which the writer of the above
is a very fair specimen unit! Women who fall
—and according to “Society” all “unmarried
mothers ” are fallen women—do so because
they do not “ know enough.” They are
sentimental, loving, green, silly creatures.
They are ignorant of the dubious where-
abouts of the quack abortionist’s surgery, or
if they know of it, are too modest—yes,
journalistic compounder of moral “ society ”
platitude—too modest to call in the surrep-
titious aid of the unlegalised Balsamo.
They are exposed to all the cynicism of a
sneering “respectable” world, because they
were what “ (Society ” would term shock-
ingly ignorant of the simplest principles of
physiology—so carefully inculcated in the
modern belle whose mother moves in “circles
select and hong tongy,” and around whose
cradle has been described a magic circle
bearing the mystic phrase, “ Get your girls
off before they begin to wither.” The
“ hunted down ” ones have no such brilliant
fortune. Theirs are the scorn and the
suffering ; the “ Society ” sinners, scores of
them, sin on a scale of superior knowledge,
and sin, too, in much better fashion and
with considerably more taste. Hundreds of
women who hold their diamond-tiara’d heads
aloft in the blaze of “ Society’s ” gaslight,
radiant in beauty and clothed in the truly
superfine virtue of not being found out, are
a thousandfold greater offenders than the
quivering, trembling wretch who deposits
the illicit bundle done up in a newspaper —
mayhap a sheet of the Sydney D.T.—upon
the virtuous and unconscious doorstep of
church deacon.
* * *
The D.T., however, goes on to say :
“ Children, whose dire misfortune it is to hav6
such parents, are, perhaps, better abandoned than
not; but that altera neither the lav/ nor the
morality of the case. Crime is crime” —Great
Scott, who would have thought it f “ and society
must protect itself. And, accordingly, society,
as represented by the policeman, tracks down the
outcast mother and drags her to gaol. We do not
complain of this ”
No ! cheap moralist, we do not suppose
that you lie heavier, or eat lighter, for ah
the hideous human misery the sad-faced sun
shines down upon. But what unconscious
satire!—“Society, as represented by the
policeman. ” Modern ‘‘ society ”is too mono-
tonously represented by the policeman.
Why quibble ? Tne “trap ” is useful for the
protection of “ Society,” which protection,
apparently, seems best asssured by tracking
down the outcast mother and dragging her to
gaol. The writer does not mind, however,
though the poor woman be an “ outcast” ;
“society must protect itself.” What
a pity, by the way, is it that the
writer was not exposed when an in-
fant. Society! Society ! ! Society !! ! “So-
ciety,” to paraphrase the historic utterance
of Madame Roland, “what inhumanities
are committed in thy name ! ” which, after
their commission, receive the gratified smile
of snivelling approval from society-subsidised
newspapers.
•K* ft-
Again, quoting from this new Social
Purity organ a slab of unctuous moralising :
“Maudlin sympathy for women guilty of these
crimes would be, as everyone would admit, a bad
thing ”
Ah ! facile ; compounder of sermonising drivel,
compiler of senile platitude, no one would
ever make so egregious a mistake as to
accuse you of sympathy, “maudlin” or other-
wise, with anything that suffers. The only
sympathy of which you are capable is sym-
pathetic admiration for the success that cul-
minates in a fat bank-book and a concretion
of meanness in mortar in .a mansion at Potts
or Darling Point, or amidst the clustering
foliage of Elizabeth or Double Bay. Finally,
a sop is thrown to the Cerberus of the oppo-
site sex, carefully sugared with words of
pretended respect for outraged womanhood.
Listen: — ,
“ But it Is useless asking the law to remedy the
injustice women suffer in these respects. Women
must first do justice to themselves. While a
woman with daughters of her own will receive
into her drawing-room the seducer of another
woman’s daughter, no matter how exalted the one
or how low the other in the social scale, that
women fmfeits all right to pity for whatever in-
sults she may suffer in common with her sex.”
Now, what is the D.T.-giving us ? If this is
the doctrine it intends henceforth to teach,
it will not long continue to hold the office
of the chief moolahship in the sacred society'
sect. This is a bitter saying, and a true ;
Society trades off her daughters by operating
upon the lowest and most brutal passions of
her sons. The nudity of the pretended dress
which seems designed only to reveal as much
of the feminine body as it is possible to re-
veal without revealing it all, the subtle
aroma of rare blooms, the gauzy floating
drapery, the luxurious soft and silken
couches and ottomans, the delirious rose lit
privacy of half illumined conservatories, the
bewitching sound of sensuous music, the
intoxicating coquetry and tutored dalliance
of the female charmers ; all these things are
designed to entrap, and to entrap through
the medium of the passions. If not, what
are they for ? We have heard of a
‘ ‘ Society ” dame who married tw o out of three
daughters by surprising them, faux-fuyunt,
with their lovers. The “ Society ” woman
decline to receive the seducer in her draw-
ing-room ! Pshaw ! the boudoir is the serve
chaude of seduction. If the pretty moths
do occasionally singe their lovely wings they
must remember that they are playing with
fire. But if the D.T. wants to keep its
hand upon the steering-gear of the radiant
wreck called society, no more of this sacri-
lege. Society operates in dark and devious
ways, and ways unclean, to accomplish her
mysterious ends. She erects a glittering
shrine over a cesspool, and garnishes it with
curious filigree and tinsel work, and the
humble votary who bows and worships the
gilded image of the venerable old harpy,
Mrs. Grundy, must not rise from his knees,
as does the D.T., and begin to question her
morality.
• * *
The most heartless, the most callous, the
most selfish and sensual and disgustingly
unsentimental period in English history, is
that in which the “Merrie” Monarch, Sedley
and Rochester, Etherege and Wycherly,
Yanbrugh and Farquhar, move across
the stage and pourtray the leading charac-
teristics of their generation. In the drama-
tic literature of that day every comedy turns
upon the relations between the sexes. The
leading characters are ever three—the hus-
band, the wife, and the lover. The husband
is always a poor, witless cuckold, only wait-
ing to be deceived. The lover is always a
dashing gallant who has never been known
to fail either in love or in war. All the
contempt, the ridicule, the pitiless sarcasm
are heaped by the playwright upon the poor,
honest, suffering husband. The triumphant
lover receives all the applause, all the lime-
light and coloured-fire illuminations, all the
glory, all the fat. The principle has con-
tinued down to the present day, only we
have shifted the ground of its application.
To-day we give the moral a commercial
point, and beatify the tale with a mercan-
tile adornment. But it is the Charles -the-
Second morality, nevertheless. We laugh
at honest ignorance and blunt but unsuccess-
ful ffiain-dealing. We genuflect to the cor-
rupt swindler if he be corrupt on a suffi-
ciently gigantic scale. We adorn with roses
the brows of him who has taken an unfair
fall out of his more upright opponent,
“ Secure the swag ! ” This summarises all
the law and all the prophets when read in the
fierce light of nineteenth century-business
notions of competitive success. The Press
never scourges the free and prosperous
scoundrel who drives abroad in a carriage
and sits on a dozen finauoial-trafficboards
The Press waits till the scoundrel is no
longer successful. It lashes round anc
demands justice after the law-courts have
finished with the collapsed bladder. But ii
never worries much about the decencies oi
the case if the culprit be poor or an “ out-
cast.” It can howl and pant for blood, too,
when there seems a chance of shifting from
well-nurtured shoulders the responsibilities
of all the crime that is committed in the
world. How it does rally to the rescue or
the protection of its poor old wooden fetich,
Mrs. Grundy ! Its devotion would be
amusing were it not pitiable. This news-
paper press, with such vast possibilities for
the good of humanity, is, after all, only a
tamed tiger, a starved and craven beast of
prey, which licks the hand that beats and
half-feeds it to day, and to-morrow fills
the air with its fierce carnivorous roaring for
the blood of seventeen-year-old children who
have no scraps with which to placate its mas-
ter or to satisfy its own peculiar appetite—
save such scraps as are raked from the
garbage-heaps of unsavoury outrages,
* * •
The other day the D.T. published an
article of considerably over a column on
“ Commercial Morality.” With what frantic
haste does it stretch forth its feeble hand to
smite the impersonal offender ! With what
chivalric courage does it gird on its armour
to do battle with a shadow ! Its warlike
spirit is conjured up with much playing of
journalistic tom-toms when a ghostly abuse
is to be exorcised; when the foe is not
tangible, and when a whiff will dispel the
opposing argument into something less than
the pallid adumbration of diaphanous smoke.
But when the offender is rich and his offence
smells rank in H» aven, the Sydney Press
maintains a stolid and mulish silence and
staggers along with its dreary old cartload of
commonplace drivel, like an apathetic Mus-
sulman oblivious of the nuisance of the hour
when from the muezzin comes the periodic
call to prayer. The distribution of the fund
subscribed by the public for the relief of the
Bulli sufferers is a case in point. It is broadly
current in Sydney that certain individuals
interested in the Bulli Coal Mining Company
have managed to secure seats on the com-
mittee for the manipulation of the relief
fund, and that these Bulli coal-mine share-
holders are so managing the publicly-sub-
scribed money as to bargain for the retire-
ment of legal proceed ings by the widows of
those men who are said to have come by
their death through alleged criminal negli-
gence on the part of the company. Now,
here was an opportunity for a little of that
“feather-weight” journalism the D.T,
affects so much to admire.
* * *
For some months past “ Society,” all the
world over, has been greatly agitated by a
remarkable piece of work undertaken by a
newspaper to right a wrong. The case was
known as the Langworthy case ; the jour-
nal was the Pall Mall Gazette. The
Sydney D.T. almost lost its ordinary bour-
geois poise over the matter, and began to
talk delirium about the beauty and holiness
of justice, and the power of the press for
good. But it soon recovered its vulgar pivot.
It made no attempt to emulate the Lang-
worthy case and the Pall Mall Gazette’s
action in connection therewith. The Bulli
widows were being denied justice ; more,
they were being denied food. It was deter-
mined to starve them out, or it appeared so,
unless they gave their promise to the com-
pany not to prosecute. Tdl they had money
they could not prosecute. I aw is costly, and
bread is more valuable sometimes than jus-
tice. Did any Sydney paper come forward
and advocate the cause of the women ? Did
the D.T. or the S.M. Herald announce
that they were prepared to receive sub-
scriptions for the purpose of forming
a fund wherewith to legally investigate
the cause of the terrible holocaust on
the altar of Capital which shocked and
stunned all Australia, from Carpentaria
to Spencer Gulf ? No ! Have not these
papers maintained the most stolid silence,
particularly so in the case of theS. M. Gerald.
When they spoke was it not to give utterance
to some heavy chopped logic in favour of
those who have, and in opposition to those
who have not, to recite some wise saws and
exceeding ancient instances which might
have effected the legislative insanities of the
Kings of Israel and Judah, but which have
no application to the needs of to-day, and
which must have been moth-eaten and blue-
mouldy afar back in the ages of cromlechs
and dolmens, before Methusaleh was a
boy ? It is said that this course—this silence
and this opposition—arises from the fact that
certain shareholders in these newspaper com-
panies are also shareholders in certain coal
mining companies. How very human—or
rather, somewhat less than human—these
newspapers are after all !
* * *
What the “ Society ” paper, thd journal
of the morally and religiously “elect” and
“ select,” declines to do, is taken up in rough
and full-hearted fashion by a man, whose
one reason for existence seems to be’to gi Ve
these aforecited journals somebody to attack
and calumniate. Mr. Ninian Melville is
no curled and perfumed darling of the Clubs
or the Points. He is a consistent democrat
a miner’s member, and—an undertaker. The
things of sweetness and light, the lions and
giants of thepapsrcamp, give himno kind word
for the good he does, but ever maliciously
twit him concerning his trade, and the clumsy
Premier of New South Wales, Falstaffian in
wit as in physique, manages to get no small
amount of facetiousness out of the Northum-
berland member’s mode of earning bis daily
bread. Sir Henry Parkes should remem-
ber that we have fallen upon evil times which
are crying for good grave-diggers. There'
are more botches and bungles above the'
earth’s surface than beneath it !
* * *
And of all botches and bungles one throws
its baneful shadow over the earth and extin-
guishes the remainder. Eclipse is first
indeed, in this instance ! The one thing that
bars the onward progress of reform is that
thing of shreds and patches, that effigy of
sentiment and sham-flam—Mrs. Grundy.
The one prolific hot-bed of abuse and social'
disease is that modern growth of moneyed
interest and social folly miscalled the
“ Moral Press.”
“Negroes and Nemesis."
‘ An American Citizen” writes in re a recent
article in The Bulletin bearing the above head-
line
“ The inference clearly is that the negro race is mcreasiii
at such a rapid rate as to imperil the domination of the pa
face. How do you reconcile this with the following statist!
taken from Carnegie's ‘ Triumphant Democracypage 3:
‘ The proportion of the coloured to the white element nece
sarily grows less and less. In 1790 it was 27 per cent, cf th
whole, in 183 j it had fallen to 18 per cent., in 1880 it wasonl
13 per cent. While the total white population of thecountr
has risen from ten and a half to forty-three and a hal
millions in fifty years, the number of the coloured popula
tion has only risen from two and a quarter to six and a ha
millions. This steady decrease results from two cause
First the coloured race receives no immigrants, but is r
stricted wholly to native increase for its growth; and secon<
it has been proved that although their birth-rate is greate
than that of the whites, it is more than balanced by the
higher death-rate. The increase of coloured people fron
1860 to 1880 was but 48 per cent, against 61 per cent u creas
of the whites.’ A little further on Carnegik expresses th
opinion that 1 the conclusion seems unavoidable that th
coloured race cannot hold its own numerically against th
whites and must fall farther and farther behind.' Who ha
made a mistake, your writer or Carnegie ?”
We should like to draw attention to two othe
statements made by Carnegie in the sam
chapter. In one the Scotchman admits :
“ The universal testimony is that the former slaves rapidl
develops the qualities of freemen, and exhibit, in a surpris
ing degree, the capacity to manage their own affairs. Man
of them at once arrangedat the conclusion of the civi
war—“ with their former masters to work a part of th
plantation upon shares. Others bargained for the purchas
of strips of land. They are now quite orderly and well
behaved, and much more industrious than before.”
In another sentence In the same chapter Carnegie
admits that—
“ It is too soon to judge whether, with superior knowledg
and more provident habits flowing from freedom, this esees
sive death-rate will not be considerably reduced."
Carnegie allows an increase in the native-born
white population of a fraction over 3 per cent, per
annum, an increase which cannot possibly be kept
up when immigration shall cease, and that there
is a strong presumption that it will cease within a
comparatively short period the fact that the land
is being rapidly absorbed by speculators and rail*
way-grab syndicates is sufficient. Says Henry
George :
“ For the very reason that our growth is so rapid, and our
progress so swift; for the very reason that all the tendencies
of modem civilisation assert themselves here " —alluding to
the United States— ‘‘more quickly and strongly than any-
where else, the problems which modern civilisation must
meet will here first fully present themselves, and will most
imperiously demand to be thought out or fought out. . • •
One of the most momentous events that could happen to the
modern world would be the ending of this possibility of west-
ward expansion. That it must some time end is evident
when we remember that the earth is round. Practically, this
event is near at hand. Its shadow is even now stealing over
us. ... To feel the results of what is called pressure of
population, to realise here pressure of the same kind that
forces European emigration upon our shores, we shall not
have to wait for that. . . . There is plenty of vacan
land on Manhattan Island. But on Manhattan Island
human beings are packed closer than anywhere else in the
world. There is plenty of fresh air all around—one man
owns forty acres of it, a whiff of which he never breathes
since his home is on his yacht in European waters ; but, for
all that, thousands of children die in New York every
summer for want of it, and thousands more would die did not
charitable people subscribe to fresh-air funds. Thesocia
pressure which forces on our shores this swelling tide of no-
migration arises not from the fact that the land in Europe «
all in use, but that it is all appropriated. That will be our
case as well. Our land will not all be used; but it will all be
'fenced in.' . . . The great majority of those wishing to
settle, find it cheaper to buy, and rents in California and the
New Northwest tun from a quarter or even one half the
crop. . . There is no further West. Our advance has
reached the Pacific,' and be* ond the Pacific is the East, wi
its teeming millions.”
Considering that America owes the greater part
of her increase in her native population to the
married couples who emigrate to her shores, and
that the Yankee, born and reared in the States, *
growing averse to marriage, with the stoppage o
married immigrants—or, indeed, of immigrants a
all—her outlook as a numerically progressive
nation is not particularly encouraging- "
would, however, draw our correspondent’s atten
tion to the fact that we never stated that t e
negro race would ultimately supplant the w h
In America, as we certainly did not state as on
opinion the possibility of the Chinese supplants
the white race in Australia. \AU that was i®

Carnegie is not quotable with exactitude.
Henry George in a recent article in the
North American Review, when dealing with
“ Labour in Pennsylvania,” proved the s
ceseful Scotchman, who is enamoured of
country In which he has made his fortune, to
incorrect in many of his statements, and illogi
in his deductions in more than a single instan
In the above quotation from “ Social Problem
as well as in many other places, Henry Geor
shows very plainly that the immigratory oapac
of the United States has all but reached its lim
hence this item in the increase of its populati
will soon be nil, Again, the very increase of
whites is against them. The most prolific rac
who emigrate to America are the low and po
Irish and Germans, with numerous families,
tellectually of low standard, and, like the negro
prolific in proportion to their ignorance ant
poverty. They are merely pauper ref use—throu
no fault of their own—and hundreds go to t
wall in the struggle for existence. They cann
endure the same privation as the negro : hen
the darker-skinned man has the better chanc
In some of the Southern States the clima
is so unhealthy that only negroes can li
and work in it with impunity. The qu
tation from Carnegie simply shows th
the decrease in numbers in comparing the nog
with the white race is only one of comparison
regard to percentages, yet in quoting Carneg
the writer admits that the negro race in Ameri
has, during 50 years, risen from 2J to 6J million
without immigration. Then we must rememb
that these figures represent bona fide procrcatio
and that mainly since the emancipation of tl
slaves only a trifle over 20 years ago. Let th
white Hood-wave of immigration dash against th
sand-bar of absolute prohibition, and we hav
those facts to consider : The negro, educate
and capable of greater hardship than th
white, marries and begets children, with
out much anxiety as to their futur
ability to procure a livelihood; while th
native-born white Americans are becomin
growingly averse to marriage and limiting the
families by artificial means. One boy and on
girl, two boys, or two girls, constitute the mode
American family. These just replace the fathe
and mother. Americans, as a rule excep
among the very rich or the very poor—live i
lodgings and hotels, and are disinclined to wha
English people call “ home life.” The America
wife frequently pursues the same calling after a
she did before marriage. She simply enters int
domestic business with a husband during tb
hours she is not following her ordinary avocation
This tendency encourages celibacy both in men
and women, and Americana take refuge from un
fruitful and therefore objectless matrimony in
divorce—frequent and unsentimental—and rove
round for fresh excitement in new alliances, which
-having, perhaps, nearly the complement of two
children- are usually childless. Reach the abso
lute limit of accomodation —which means unpur
chasable land—and “Negroes and Nemesis” is not
whit over stated. The Negro is in every way on
a better footing, but being even now, notwith
standing the stupid equality brag of the Ameri
can constitution, of a despised race, he is incited to
greater exertion than he would otherwise be. He
is put upon his mettle. The Africans have given
the world a Toussaint L’Ouverture in military
genius ; to oratory a Frederick Douglas ; and
an African black in Sydney is prepared to knock-
out all comers at Foley’s saloon in Gcorge-street,
for £lOOO a side. About two years ago the New
York Sun had the following anent Negro Progress
in the United States, which we cannot refrain
from quoting: —
“ Twenty years ago, at the close of the war, there were in
the Southern States 3,947,000 coloured people, and now there
are more than 7,000,000. Then there were in Mississippi
220,000 negroes; now 650,000. Then there were in South
Carolina 400,000; now more than 600,000. Five hundred
coloured babies are born in the United States every day. The
coloured population of the United States doubles every 20
years; the white population only once in 35 years. Eight
years will not have passed before the negroes will be in
numerical majority in some of the Southern States. At the
present rate of increase, in 1985 there will be 96,000,000 white
people in the United States, and 192.000,000 coloured people.
The day is not far distant when it will be a physical im-
possibility to continue the present practical disfranchisement
of the coloured man in the Southern States. In South
Carolina he has bought and paid for 270,000 acres of land
which he cultivates. In the South he pays taxes on 91,000,000
dollars of property. He is editing, printing, and publishing
106 newspapers, and yet of the 7,000 000 coloured people of
this country more than 6,000,000 cannot read or write."
The M'Sharry Arbitration.
Hi; must be what the Yankees would doubtless
call a ‘'hardshell" optimist who can view even
the outward and visible facts of the M'Siiarby
dispute without serious misgivings as to the ten-
dency of the times. This is in many respects pro-
perly styled the age of progress par excellence.
Humanity is daily inventing and discovering new
methods of successfully combating the forces of
nature, and of utilising the material things fur-
nished by mother earth for the increased advant-
age of mankind. On the whole, perhaps, there is
also a movement in the direction of diffusing the
benefits wrought by man’s labour and intelligence
out of the crude substances and forces discover-
able by his well-nigh omniscient faculties;
though when one contemplates the existing lati-
fundia and segregation of wealth, side by
si,de with widespread misery and starvation,
t|ie outlook seems gloomy enough, in all con-
science. Nevertheless and moreover, as Isaak
/Walton puts it, a careful study of the times leads
Ibo the conclusion that in the all-important matter
W Justice the most progressive sections of the
Ihuman family are making little or no headway,
i>£, indeed, they are not absolutely retrograding, j
.l j,atice is at once the foundation of social sta-
h litjr, and the initial cause of all progress. The
constant tendonoy of man is to break the bonds |
which hold society together, and he is frustrated
only by and to the extent of the efficiency of the
machinery for the enforcement 'of rights. And
there are unquestionable proofs on all hands that,
so far from this machinery undergoing im-
provement proportionate with the general ad-
vance of knowledge and bettering of methods, it
is rather deteriorating, and it is hardly too much
to say that the possessor of a just claim and
merely a slender purse is worse off in these days
of boasted progress than he was a generation ago.
• • *
The history of the M'Sharry case certainly
gives colour to this belief. About two years and
a-half ago M'Sharry’s firm completed the con-
struction of a railroad for the New South Wales
Government from Murrumburrah to Young.
Owing to delays for which the Engineer-in-Chief’s
and other Government Departments were respon-
sible, the work was not finished within the
specified time, and the contractors were put to
heavy expenses beyond what they had calculated
upon. The District Engineer also contrived, by a
variety of extraordinary measures, to largely in-
crease the cost of construction and delay its com-
pletion. Then, after completion and approval a
considerable portion of the line was washed
away by a flood ; and herein lay the
main cause of difference between the Go.
vernment and the contractors. The Engineer-
in-chief coolly offered £2lOO to M'Sharry and Co.
to make good the damage, an amount probably
not in excess of a tenth of the sum required to be
expended. When this offer was declined, Mr.
Whitton assumed an arbitrary demeanor, and re-
fused to entertain the question of settlement for
the work performed. When pressed he threatened
to enforce the stipulated penalties for delay, not-
withstanding that the delay was obviously and
demonstrably attributable entirely to the laches
of the Government. The amount actually in dispute
at this time was less than £20,000. The matter
came before the Supreme Court in Equity, and it
was at length agreed to submit it to arbitra-
tion. The award was made last week*
in the result M'Sharry and Co. getting
rather more than they were prepared to accept in
full settlement in the first instance. Hence the
Public Treasury will have to suffer to the amount
of more than the original claim, and, in addition,
will have to pay costs to the tune of over £30,000!
From the point of view of the taxpayer, therefore,
the whole business is open to the severest con-
demnation ; and if Parliament does not insist upon
having the officials responsible for this enormous
waste properly punished, the utility of that insti-
tution as a public protection will be more than
ever open to doubt. But the direct loss to the
Treasury is by no means the worst feature of the
business. The evidence adduced goes to
show that the Railway Construction De-
partment is honeycombed with injustice,
and assuredly contractors will not forget the fact
when tendering prices for work in the future.
They will undoubtedly lay on a good percentage to
cover the risk of being arbitiarily forced into a
tedious and costly suit for the recovery of money
due to them ; and thus the public interests will
suffer to an incalculable extent.
* * *
The prevailing opinion among men experienced
in the ways of the N.S.W. Railway Department
is that their steadfast refusal to liquidate
M'Sharry’s demands emanated from the not
unnatural supposition that he would be disin-
clined or unable to fight the Government. Other
contractors in the past have quietly submitted to
gross injustice, rather than fall out with the
autocrats of the Railway Department; and there
were in M'Sharry’s case special grounds for
the belief that he would not venture on litigation,
which, whatever the issue, would involve him in
ruin. Itwouldreallyappear, indeed, that the official
mind fondly contemplated the project of starving
M'Sharry and Co. out. These gentlemen have
built another railroad for the New South Wales
Government, and the final payments on account
of this work, about which there is no dispute,
have been for many months unlawfully withheld,
possibly because it was known that the money
was required as the sinews of war. There
is a way of holding back certificates Jthat ope-
rates oppressively against contractors, and disad-
against the real interests of the coun-
try ; but in M'Sharhy’s case the system seems to
have been carried to unparalleled lengths, and it is
to be hoped that the Department is satisfied with the
result. It has succeeded in well-nigh ruining the
firm which incurred its hostility. The struggle, ex-,
tending over nearly three years, has cost the un-
fortunate contractors in one way and another within
a few thousands of the amount of the award.
During that time—and for all time, so long
as the present ofliciais remain in power—they
have been and will bo debarred from entering into
contracts with the Department. They are left
with a large and costly plant, unsaleable in these
times of slack work, and valueless to them, since
they dare not engage in operations under the
functionaries they have combated and van-
quished. Their position calls for the sympathy
of all men imbued with a sense of justice. They
have gained one of those victories which is only
nominally different from a defeat ; yet the fact of
their having gained the day clearly proves that
they never should have been forced Into fighting
at all.
* * *
What hope can there be for the community
which maintains such arrogant dictation and
systematic injustice as part and parcel of its
bureaucratic policy ? Plainly it must lose all
along the line In connection with works under the
control of this wretched organisation. The evil
is rendered possible, and ,is intensilied by the
iniquitous system current for what is euphemisti-
cally styled the administration of justice. If there
were cheap and speedy means of securing the
redress of wrongs, such wrongs as those remorse
ilessly inflicted on M'Sharry and Co. would
scarcely ever be attempted. Men, however despotic
and indifferent to the principles of common justice
would shy at forcing others into litigation that
would end quickly in a fair settlement. But, so
long as a law-suit is a ruinous business, whichever
way the result goes, men, such as the Czars
of this Railway Department, who are libe-
rally supplied with 'war material out of
funds not their own, will not hesitate to create
wrongs, and laugh derisively at the vain efforts
of their victims to obtain redress. The Court of
Equity broke down at an early stage of its inves-
ligation of this simple dispute, and thankfully
iransferred the matter to three arbitrators. In
he hands of this board doubtless the questions at
ssue would have been solved in a few days, if
hey had been plainly stated, and the arbirra-
ors left to themselves. But the legal
raternity, of course, could not permit
his, and money being forthcoming the
iwyers pounded away; of course they soon sue-
eeded in complicating a very simple position.
they did get to themselves, the arbitrators
rare not slow co perceive the rights of the case. The
ward is a fair one in the abstract. The amount
i just about what ought to have been paid over
wo years since. It does not cover more than was
riginally due. To have reimbursed M'Sharry
iid Co. for their enormous losses, more or less
irectly consequent on the arbitrary refusal of the
overmnent to settle the claim, the arbitrators
rght to have awarded a sum noc far short of the
£lOO,OOO demanded by the plaintiffs. But a settle-
ment on such just principles was hardly to be ex-
pected, taking the personnel of the board and all
the circumstances into consideration. The result
shows the necessity for making the Chief Engineer's
department amenable to some authority other
than a so-called Court of Justice or board of
arbitration, as an alternative to the perpetuation
of scandalous infringements of the commonest
rules laid down for the guidance of men’s conduct
in civilised society.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Garrett’s Little Game.
There is a great deal more significance in the an-
nouncement made by the New South Wales
Minister for Lands, that it is the intention of the
Government to remodel the land law, than a
majority of the public may imagine. The Bul-
letin contends that the land law is fundamentally
wrong, but, assuming that it is otherwise, the
people who are directly interested in the question
have no real grievance of such magnitude as to
justify the repeal of the law, more particularly if
the colony Is to revert to the old system, under
which jobbery, robbery, perjury, forgery, and all
manner of crimes flourished so luxuriantly. The
only grievance of the pastoral leasees is tnat the
present law is restrictive to such an extent as not
to appease their earth-hunger; they want very
largo lumps, which they expect the public to
provide for nothing or less than nothing. If the
selfish squatters Imagine that the influence of the
secret society which holds its meetings at Scott 8
hotel, Melbourne, is going to lead to any further
robbery of the public of New South Wales they
are woefully mistaken. They are doomed to cer-
tain disappointment if they suppose that there is
the least likelihood of Garrett’s promised bill in
their favour ever becoming law. It is not with a
view to afford relief to the occupants of Crown
lands, because they are entitled to such, relief that
tnia gospel of land law reform is propounded.
Those wily tacticians, Parkes and Garrett,
have a less worthy object than that in view. Tne
activity displayed by the champions of the Aus-
tralian cause of Protection, and the unmistakable
indications of growing public feeling in favour of
that principle, are viewed with dismay by the
members of the Government, a majority of whom
renounced Protection for the sake of place and
pay. It is true that Parkes and Garrett— the
latter with characteristic effrontery, considering
his uncertain attitude on the question a
few weeks before he became a Minister and
smote his chief with “ the red-hot brand
of shame”—affect to despise the agitation in
favour of the “creature" Protection, but this is
simply a piece of political trickery. Neither of the
tricksters would hesitate about becoming an advo-
cate of protection to-morrow if he thought that
by so doing he could further his own ends, but
both have the astuteness to recognise that there is
a point of political degradation at which even the
New South Wales public might draw the line.
The Government have to serve their masters, the
Calico Jemmies, and the promised land bill is to
be the weapon with which they are to crush the
“creature.” The land bill is deliberately thrust
forward to counteract, if possible, the agitation
on the more important question as to whether or
not New South Wales is to be “ run ” by a syndi-
cate who will batten on the cheap labour of
leprous lecherous Mongolians, European paupers,
and American prisoners, while Australians will
be left to starve or else be the recipients of charity
from the Government. The Government know
that they cannot woo the votes of the electors by
voicing their own political virtues, and as for then-
social virtues it would be ridiculous excess to at-
tempt to define; or defend them; they cannot
trade on the alleged vices of their opponents as
they did at the last election ; they dare not enter
into an open-handed Combat with the champions
of protection, and their only hope of averting their
own downfall is by raising a side issue. The duty
of all sincere protectionists is not only to agitate
persistently but also to expose the hollowness of
the latest trick of that slippery pair of politicians
Parkes and Garrett.
Ae Ij* *
and ° Parkea’ new Magistrates.
week Parkes’ and his crew of turncoat
jjssters appointed no fewer than five hundred
new justices of the peace. With one or two ex-
ceptions, the whole batch consists of men whose
fitness for the office of magistrate is open to grave
doubt. They are for the most part politics 1 wire-
pullers who have earned distinction by more or
less'political manoeuvring in the interests of the
KreCtrade gang. The Orange organisation is re-
warded for past services and propitiated in re-
spect of services in the future by the elevation of
all its chief members to the magisterial bench ;
and all, or nearly all, the little popinjays
who hopped about during the last general
election, touting for votes to put the played-out
Parkes in power, are perched up on tne same
wh'' n platform of dignity and authority. For
the rest the new commission embraces scarcely
any name in which the people can possibly have
confidence. The state of things in which such a
monstrous exercise of Ministerial audacity can be
perpetrated assuredly is in need of immediate and
drastic reform. The example set by Parkes will
to a certainty be followed by his successors. If
his successors went the whole hog, and displaced
the tag-rag and bob-tail he has created into magis-
trates by an entirely fresh set of men, the
effect would not be serious. Bat we cannot
hope for such a praiseworthy measure.
What will be done is easily forecasted.
The next Ministry will simply select fire hundred
supporters and put them in beside Parks s’ nomi-
nees ; and hence the public will to suffer a
affliction. The old-fangled absurdity of
appointing justices of the peace is now converted
into a monstrous public wrong. The people
surely can tolerate the condition no longer. The
ministers of justice in courts of first instance
should, and sooner or later must, be elected for
short terms by the people over whom they exer-
cise jurisdiction ; and they should be paid for
their services. The people generally are far more
deeply concerned in the administration of the
minor courts than in that of the superior tribunals.
The police courts deal with the wrongs of the
poorer classes, who outnumber the rich by about
ten to one. Yet the business of these courts is
handed over to the management of a tribe of poli-
tical hangers-on, for the most part devoid of
attainments, intellectual or educational, qualifying
them for higher duties than the securing of votes
by means of long-sleevers and potnouse logic. If
Parkes’ insolent performance has the effect, as
we believe it must, of speedily bringing about the
desired reform, he will not have held office this
time in vain. It is by such abuse of power as this
that the eyes of the people are opened to tho
necessity for fundamental change. The need for
reform in the mode of appointing magistrates and
judges has always existed. Now it is too urgent
to admit of any further procrastination; and the
people a~e indebted to Parkes for at least this one
good result of what he is pleased to'call his honest
administration.
The Bottomless Pitt.
The painted face of the weary Goddess of Justice
again looks out on the public from the columns of
the Sydney press. More in sorrow than in anger
the Law—that true embodiment of every thing
that is excellent—has smitten John Samuel Pitt,
and that citizen retires from active manslaughter
for a period of nine months. On the same day
Edward Doolan, who was ui-justifiably in posses-
sion of a silver watch and chain—presumed to be
worth £5 —received a sentence of four years im-
prisonment ; and Arthur Cheesewright, who
had kleptomaniaed two horses and a saddle was
consigned to penal servitude for five years. We
trust that Mr. Pitt will take warning by the fate
of these two hardened and depraved criminals.
At present he ranks as a simple homicide; his
character is comparatively unstained, and when
in a weak moment he killed a little girl, the man
who embodied the law of New South Wales
exercised a kindly discretion, and did his utmost
to condone this first departure from the strict line
of rectitude. But if ho fails to profit by tho
warning—if in place of doing nothing worse than
killing another little girl he sinks lower and lower,
and finally in a state of ruffianly abasement steals
a silver watch and chain—ho must understand
that the law will give him particular sheol. We
trust, however, that he may never come to this.
Justice in New South Wales is tempered with
mercy, and the admonition it has addressed to
John Samuel Pitt may ultimately lead him
to better things. Possibly if Edward
Doolan had fallen into the hands of
paternal justice when he killed his first
little girl, even he might have been induced to re-
form before he sank Into the gulf of iniquity in
which he now wallows ; who can tell 1 But," on
the other hand, it must be remembered that there
are hardened criminals in existence who never
went through the preliminary stage of killing a
little girl, and thus grew wicked by degrees, but
who, even at the outset of their careers, were past-
masters in villainy, and appropriated property
valued at 255. and upwards, and it may be that
Edward Doolan was a monster of this remorse-
less type. If so, he is beyond sympathy. For the
man who only kills a girl there is still hope, and
even at the worst he Inflicts little real injury on
society, for there are girls in abundance every-
where, and the actual cash value of a little girl is
almost nil. But the man who steals a watch
commits an offence against “proputty,” and
“ proputty” is as scarce as girls are plentiful. In
estimating the value of a going watch at five
times that of a girl, however, the law has evi-
dently attempted to strike an average, and has
done it badly. Under a legal system which re-
gards nothing but property, an article must be
appraised according to its scarcity, and while
little girls, whom nobody seems to own, are wait-
ing to be fallen over at every street corner there
are probably not ten unclaimed watches in the
whole city of Sydney. Now and then a girl goes
amissing, but nobody is much troubled about tho
circumstance. Now and then, also, a .watch goes
astray, and then the whole police system is con-
vulsed until justice is done. But, unfortunately,
the violence of the upheaval caused by the loss of
an article of jewellery valued at £5 Is. is sometimes
permitted to obscure important issues, and Judge
Stephen’s noble effort to adjust the cases
of Pitt and Doolan on a purely cash
basis has not been so successful as it de-
served, The watch which brought the latter into
trouble was ultimately returned to its owner un-
injured ; the girl with whom Pitt was concerned
was also returned, but regarded as a girl she was
absolutely useless. In one sense, too, the loss
was irreparable. Girls may be plentiful—so
plentiful, indeed, that tho law may bs fully justi-
fied in valuing one at one-fifth the price of a silver
watch—but the same girl could never come back
any more. The watch might be duplicated, but
the girl never could. Consequently a girl ought
to rank as bric-a-brac, and however low an esti-
mate the law might place on the girl in question
something should have been done to more effec-
tually deter John Samuel Pitt from fooling with
poisons which he did not understand. If he is
permitted to go on, he may, at some future day.
poison a girl of consequence, just as the slavey
who practises on the tea-service may end by
smashing an antique vase. Also, Edward
Doolan may at the next opportunity steal a
watch of some consequence, but then the watch
can he recovered and tho girl can’t. Perhaps in
view of all this there may seem to be some in-
equality in the two sentences—it is really difficult
to say. Possibly next time this pair are heard of
Doolan will have cleaned out a jeweller’s shop,
and Pitt massacred a whole boarding school, and
then Parliament may at last make a serious eflbrt
to decide how many girls are equal to one watch,
and how much cheaper it is to kill another man's
daughter than to steal his horse. This latter
point especially demands attention in justice to
the horse, and if it is not settled at an early date,
it is difficult to say what the world will come to.

According to a statement in one of the Melbourne
daily papers, at the recent trial at Beechworth of
a Mrs. Mephan for the murder of her sister, a
very painful scene was witnessed. Upon the
passing of the death sentence the prisoner became
very agitated and implored the presiding judge
to direct that after the execution her body might
be handed over to her friends, hut His Honor
stated that it was not within his province to grant
her request. Now, why should this he ? To the
g untie Bashi-bazonk, or the peaceful cannibal-
islander, our alleged Christian laws must be of a
dark and bloody character. Surely the vengeance
of tho law should end with the death of the guiltjr

joy in the mental torture of its sacrificial

chma-exacting justice has been appeased. It

London, Sunday.—Her Majesty the Queen has refused

Is for which were raised in honour rf the Jubilee year.
■ Majesty's refusal is the result of her annoyance at the

:er this, we take back all we said about poor
■ren Tennyson and his mildewed, spavined
j. The ode was gocd enough for the occasion,
e patient old poet has laboured steadily for 37
its fixing up little things in honour of the
hlphs and their sisters, and their cousins, and
sir aunts, and though in his sere and yellow
f he is grinding his verse exceedingly small, he
still as gocd as the occasion demands. When
it 50th anniversary cane round he perte-
ted a dizzy hunk of blank prose in which
stated that something might be done to
t the scavenging business cn a better
ting in the year of Jubilee, and also that
eye might be kept on dead cats ; and many
tics—ourselves among the number—regarded
s as a bald and unsatisfactory way of dealing
Dh the subject. But we take it all back. Any

ibed in this cablegram. Within the space of
ee months Victoria has anathematised two
spitals because the money spent on them was
t sent to aid her Royal white elephant, instead
being laid out to relieve hunger, suffering, and
neral pre eminence in grief ; she has graciously
nated £2 to a penniless woman out of
a fortune of £25 000 which should have
en hers, as the next-of-kin and heir at law,
,t which had coma instead to the Royal
ffers, and she has taken up a collection
jm the guests entertained in her own palace for
pairs to the Royal stove. The partially bottled-
> avarice and meanness of 50 years has been let
jse in this year of Jubilee, and, consequently,
e British public find themselves between Ten-
don and the deep sea. The poor old ode-
onger told them to “give their gold to the hospital,”
id Victoria says, in effect, that she’ll see them
rther if they do. But Tennyson wasn’t to
ame. He has done his best to hold up his end
the log for 37 weary years, and now by way of

ispitals, and has ordered an ode from a party by

Mr Justice Stephen, of N.8.W., last week
ordered the gentle gaol flogger to assist the moral
influence of the law by scarifying an unfortunate
wretch whose act, we are entitled to contend on
t ie highest scientific evidence, is, in itself, irrefut-
able evidence of the face that the convict is, in re-
gard to his alleged crime, morally irresponsible.
What the medical men of Australia doing that
they tacitly sanction the wanton savagery of a law
that peunits a man to he skinned alive merely be-
evus3 he is suffering from mental aberration 2
Flogging as a moral agent has been much
negleclel rf late, but the traditions attach-
ing to the honoured name of Stephen seemed to
f reshadow some such return to ,the brutal
methods of the convict era of Australian history.

such a supply of food as the natives may • equire

extent, checkmate the French tactics.” Among

that those bad, tv Id men were starving the
natives to death. Even now we are sceptical on
the point. However, there is no doubt that Mr.

the Age to “take charge of any subscriptions
which may be sent to enable us to carry out this
plan.” A deserving cause, dear friends.

Her Ma.terty’s Theatre.—" Henry V." • ><
Her Majesty’s Theatre, Sydney, opened
last Saturday in the presence of all the crowned
heads of Europe, which is our amusing way of
stating that Governor and Lady Corington were
there, .also a number of Parliamentary individuals
of more or less importance. A gentleman, whose
style of composition makes ua think he is some-
> thing in the Lancer way, writes us six
; pages of manuscript to point out that there was
no one to receive the vice regal party—no usher,
no carpet on the pavement, and no respect gene-
rally, and that Lady Carington had to scramble for
her seat the best way she could; but as The
Bulletin’s nobleman was upstairs scrambling for
a seat himself and not finding one, he missed
this incident. Inside, Her Majesty’s was gorgeous
in paint and gilding, and with its two galleries,
Its spacious circle, electric-lights, wide stair-
cases, and splendid scenery, it is much too good
a place to be used for the production of
such a washed-out spectacle as ‘ Henry V.”
. Sydney has long ago had enough of Henry, who
' was a mean, low cuss at the best. His fame rests
solely on the fact that he took a miserable advan-
tage of a foreign idiot, whose wife used to come
home with the milk, and whose son was a prema-
' turely bald individual with a large head; and when
at last the gallant monarch dropped on the de-
i feated Frenchman he found him in his shirt sitting
among the ashes under the grate, and keeping his
bleary eye on a mouse-hole. The English envoy
i tried to deliver a bullying message to the moth-
• eaten potentate, but the poor old wilted king, who
■ was at that moment under the impression that he
\ was a cat, only gazed at him solemnly for a
) minute, and then climbed in silence up the chim-
i ney and sat on the tiles. Occasionally, ho w ever,
. dunng his 30 years of dreary insanity, Charles VI.
\ would rouse up, and then he would refresh himself
i by running on all fours over the carrot bed, or
' would stay out all night in the back yard and hark,
and indite ukases in the hen-house ordering that
' the whole kingdom should be keel-hauled. He
1 died at last owing to an impression which had
1 come over him that he was an emu cr something
tearing through the wilderness towards a distant
land where there were lots of worms to live upon ;
being a conscientious mi, he cantered round ths
palace for three days in hi j efforts to act up to
the character, and the over exertion killed him.
His son, meanwhile, had found one of his mother's
mashers standing on the bridge at midnight, and
had split his head open, and for the next year or
two he was besieged in a place where he could
get hardly anything to eat. Shakespeare garbled
up this pathetic story inerder to mike Henry V.a
hero, but the man who would defraud a royal
family in such straits was not fit to be touched
with a pair of tongs. Henry ultimately
croaked of causes unknown ; it is rumoured, how-
ever, that he was blown up by the explosion of a
barrel of dead dogs. He brought up his son to be
a prize idiot, and that unlucky offspring died in
gaol, which might be termed poetic vengeance.
George bignold, who represented this inhuman
compound of doggy meanness, managed to mate
him 100 a every inch a Ring—the s r u of miserable
kin* they had in these days—and wore petti-
coats, but nobody wanted to applaud much. The
other actors were kept hopelessly in the back-
ground and got no show, though even under
these disadvantages Mr. Charles Hall, as the
French monarch in a sane moment, looked rather
the better t ing of the two.

“The Pirates of the Savannah,” Mr.
Dampier’s latest venture at Sydney Royal Stan-
dard, has many of the elements of a good melo-
drama. It is full of suddenness, and is replete
with the frame of mind that pervades a man
When he has soaped himself all over and then
finds that the water is cut off, and though it may
not be in every sense the sort of piece that en-
dureth in the caves of remembrance, there is
enough rapid and bloodthirsty transit in it to
keep it going. It is crowded up with pirates,
assassins, hunters, tigers, praying girls with long
hair, and noble-minded men who claw their way
gently up steep rocks and fall on tae fire-eating,
boiling-water-drinking brigand just as he is about
Co throw a baby over a cliff, and then it is all up
with the brigand. In the firs ; act the pirate chief
hoists the gory shirt dipoed in molasses above his
uncle’s mansion, that relative having removed to
the shining river and left his will inside a book ;
and he gallops over the chest of a woman who
is lying by the roads’de calling for her che-fid.
it he had galloped a little harder he might have
killed her, but as he didn’t, and as she is
picked up by a fat man with short legs and
brought to a public-house, and as it the i tran-
spires that her child is all safe, and as the man in
the background, who doesn’t seem to care tuppence
about the whole affair, has got Ihe will gummed
on to his cheat inside his shirt, things are sultry
for the pirate. In fact, after the first act every-
thing goes wrong with him. The three travellers
who are tied up and are about to be hanged on a
Friday get loose under the pretence that they
want to write a cheque for the pirates on a bank
where they have no account, and then they shy
bricks at the heads of these freebooters as they
puff wearily uphill, and completely disorganise
them ; the tourist whom the chief invites to stay
with him for a day or two mixes his liquor and
reduces him to the idiotic condition of Old Dog
Tray; the deceptive short-legged man goes
off with a woman whom his boss had
been keeping locked up ; and another effi-
cient malefactor absconds with a child. In
Short, when the gaffer of the gang awakes from
hia liquor he finds himself a pirate in low circum-
stances sitting miserably on a doorstep with a
head oa him, and, after a desperate straggle, he
Is sent to join his uncle beside the Beautiful S.
What the old man said to him when he got up
there is only a matter of conjecture, but it is
probable that there was a row. Mr. Baker per-
formed the pirate, and being dressed in red he
looked decidedly imposing. Mr. Dampier was
(the calm, composed man who wiped him out, and
when he wasn't wiping him out he went about
shooting tigers with great success : and Mr.
nor’kman excited general admiration as the
tourist who was asked to stay for a day
or two. The rest of the applause fell
chiefly to Miss Dampier, who did some good
acting in a small and rather tearful part; and Mr,
Leston received all that was over in his part as
an unnecessarily foolish Englishman who was very
sore through riding all day on a skittish mule.
Mr. Dampier closes at the Standard oa Friday,
•» Hamlet” being his last production.

“Popper’s Ghost,” under the manage-
ment of Mr. St. Vincent, is now occupying Sydney
Academy. We pity Pepper, and we weep for the
Ghost. We have made a study of the hollow-
eyed spectre from childhood, and we may say we
were brought up under the shadow of the cheerful
cadaver, but never in the whole course of our ex-
perience did we meet such a poor, played-out,
snuffling goblin as the one which now promenades
in green spectacles at the Academy. Ic looks all
the time as if it wished it hadn’t died, and it goes
about playing tricks that are less amusing than
last year's dead cat. The performance concludes
with “ the vanishing of the manager,” but he only
fades away a little, and his desperate efforts to
fade completely are calculated to arouse sym-
pathy. Still this is in some respects the best part
of the show, and if it is in our power to lend a
hand at the fading process and help the manager
to vanish as completely as possible, we shall be
always glad to do so.

All things that are joyous and beautiful

anything but one cripple
to the square mile, the
rest being sand and dust,

rock, and slow leathery,
flabby camels with teeth
that can masticate a
red-hot boiler. But there
is nothing of the blasted
rock or the boiler about
Miss Sherwin’s melodies,
and her songs will be
very much missed when
she is gone. We wish
now that we had kept
the camel out of this

The programme at
Sydney Aihambra has
improved a lot this week.
Johnny Cowan, whose
jokes were becoming odo-
rous, has been branded by
the management, and
the eircumstaros entered
in the day-book and ini-
tia’el, and his slouching
farce has given place to an amusing screed en-
litled “The Missing Link.” Misses Amy Morelli,
James, and Soasi contribute three rather pretty
ballads, and Mr Lawler’s “Silver Bells ” and
Messrs. Moynham and Keenan’s “ Disgusted
Lovers” are admirable. We knew a disgust'd
lover ourselves once, but his story is too long
to till here; he ended, however, by being
scalped, and marrying his step grandmother who
afterwards eloped, in a Bath chair, with his son
by a former m irriage.

horse-racing is so rare now in Adelaide that a

city. The all-round form of the principals was
good enough at the outset, but practice has im-
proved it until now local criticism has settled
down into a running fire of commendation. Con-
ductor Hazon, Ciuti, Tagliavia, Cavallieri, and
Lazzarini are warmer favourites than ever, while
Pimazzoni, Cerne, and the others have found

he can of public patronage. “ The Butler ”to
follow. On Saturday the Busy B.s started busy
ness at the Bijou with “ Held by the Enemy.”
Under the new caterers things promise to he more
elegantly served at this theatre. It has been
swept and garnished. An unwonted profusion of
fiddlers sit under the footlights, and neat-handed
Phyllises flit around with bills of fare. “ Held by
the Enemy ” is a five-act drama without a villain,
and it smells of gore and gunpowder. The scene
is laid in a beleaguered Southern American city
during the Civil War. The plot is worked out by
a trio of Southern ladies, a virtuous spy related to
the family, a Colonel in command of the enemy,
the artist of an illustrated paper, a crowd of
assistant millingtary, and a corpse on a stretcher.
As a dramatic incident the corpse is chief among
a series of thrillers. It is “carried out” in a
scene of exceptional power. But regarded as a
whole, “ Held by the Enemy ” is a patchy piece of
work, least pleasing in the strongest parts. The
heroine, who prefers Colonel to Spy in spite of her
conscience, is as unloveable as the lackadaisical
soldier of her choice. Even the unfortunate Spy
is too rough a party to excite much sympathy
when he qmetly pegs out on his little stretcher.
Scenes interest more than players, and when
the curtain falls to a storm of applause there
is little disposition to call tbo principals in front.
The performance is hardly so finished as might be
expected from aB. and B, company. Ada Yarley
Decker (no piefix on the bill) appears to be a
practised actress not happily placed in this in-
stance. Mr. Nelson Decker (nautical sounding
name !) does his little with an excess of vigour.
The other new arrival, Mr. Cecil Ward, has a
good stage presence and a voice like George
Darrell’s. About his sentimental love-making
there is less American colonel than British masher,
but he plays generally with a good deal of “ re-
served force.” As the volatile artist, who

sketches battle as they should be fought, Mr.
Brough divides honours with Miss Boucicault.
Their light comedy courting is as natural as the
lilies of the field. Miss Homer scores in a- small
part, and Mr. Leake cleverly avoids being ridicu-
lous as a faithful negro. It is hard for a burnt-
corked Briton to look as if he hadn’t escaped
from a Minstrel troupe. The assistant military
parts are fairly well filled ; and —take it altogether
—“Held b T the Enemy” ought to boom for
awhile.

A reckless Vandal named P. D, Phillips
has shattered our old idol, Shakespeare, with a
little roll of original MS. This miserable deed
was accompli-had at the last meeting of Melbourne
Shakspeare Society, when Phillips read a paper to
prove that the Swan of Avon was a blue Tory.
His political views were shown up in all their
Elizabethian hideonsness. Quotations that would
turn the stomach of the Marquis of Salisbury
came trippingly from the tongue of Phillips. There
was no getting away from the force of his contention
that “ Snakespeare seldom fails to supply r,ia aristo-
crats with comments upon the foul breaths, the
sweaty caps of the unsavoury multitude, but in
4 Coriolanus ’ he exhausts the vocabulary of con-
tempt, and presents to us a singularly vivid por-
trait of a patrician whom the very idea of the
common, people fills with irrepressible loathing
and disgust. Yet this disdainful contemner of the
p a op e is presented to us certainly not in a man-
ner to estrange our sympathies,” Well, there is
a rude awakening from the sweetest dreams. We
always believed in Immortal William until Phillips
read that p -per. Since then we have taken the
long-adored bust from the manteleshelf, and
chucked it at the bull-pup in our neighbour’s
yard. A fruitful river fills our eye, and we have
gone into mourning for the Divine Williams of our
young imagination. As for the real article, the
actual dead 'un Perdition catch our soul but

The dramatists who have rampaged for so
many years about the loveliness of women in all
her aspects, from her hair down to her boots,
were probaKlv not acquainted with Mrs. Pipes, of
Auckland (N Z.); if they had known that dis-
banded female they would have left the subject
alone. The rowdy city of Auckland, it may be
explained, goes in heavily for charity. Nowhere
is there a better show for the man with one leg,
the other having been chewed off by a whale in
the South Pacific, or for the widow with seven

children, of whom the youngest got the top of his
head blown away while discharging fireworks on
the 5 h of November ; and there is even a cordial
welcome for the healthy-looking fraud who has
suffered no external damage, but who says he
was injured internally, while serving h!s country
in Afghanistan. But Mrs. Pipes has carried the
business too far. She came to Auckland a year
ago with a reposeful-looking husband and two
offspring, and the first thing she did was to
borrow four inf mts from Mrs. Biver across
the road, and negotiate an arrangement by which
she received weekly rations for a widow and six
helpless children, one of whom was suspected of
water on the brain. Then she returned the cadged
family, and lent out her pwn pair and her husband
as well, and Mrs, Biver obtained an allowance for
six children also, together with medical comforts
for the bed-ridden Pipes, who was capable of run-
ning six miles with a stove on his back any day.
A few months later they revealed the arrange-
ment to Mrs, Banks in the next street, and she
borrowed Mrs, Pipes eldest girl and Mrs Biver’s
ditto, and appealed for assistance on the ground
that she had two idiot daughters and was utterly
penniless. When someone came round to investi-
gate the case she stunned the borrowed children
with a board, and succeeded in making them
pass master as comaiose imbeciles, and this
transaction was also settled satisfactorily.
Then began a high old time, during which the
three ladies used to fetch their allowance home
every Saturday and convert the surplus into gin.
and all went well until one unhappy evening
when Mrs. Biver, under the influence of drink,
threw Mrs, Banks’ 9 own child at Mrs. Pipes who
was coming along with her basket, and blackened
that lady’s eye with Its legs. Then Mrs. Pipes
threw a loaf through Mrs. Biver’s window, and
Mrs. Biver said that Mrs. Pipes had been in gaol,
and threw it back, and hit Mrs. Banks, who there-
upon stated that Mrs. Biver’s offspring did not
have a bath regularly, and told her to come out.
Then another loaf and a pound of tea went
through the window, also a leg of mntton, a boot,
some sugar, two stones, an egg, an apple, a bottle
of vinegar, and a flat bottle that had held brandy,
and as Mrs. Biver still declined to emerge, Mrs.
Pipes captured one of her daughters, and chastised
her in order to harrow her mother’s feelings. Upon
this Mrs. Biver emerged and disabled Mrs. Pipes
by throwing two ounces of pepper at her head,
and having done this she got Mrs. Banks down
and ran a big knobbly hair-pin into her. Next
Mr. Pipes turned up and thrashed his wife on
general principles, and finally two policemen
lifted Mrs. Biver off Mrs, Banks, and Mrs. Biver’s
daughter “fetched” one of them on the back of
the head with a bottle for his otflciousness This
act the officer set down somehow to Mr. Pipes
and after he had clubbed that citizen two or three
times the whole crowd were run in. Upon hear-
ing of these troubles the Benevolent Society’s
officer came down to inquire into the condition of
15 children —two of them imbecile-who were
supposed to be left unprotected, and Mrs, Pipes'
daughter showed him where Mrs. Banks had hit
her on the head with a board and thus gave the
whole scheme away. And this is why the bed-
ridden Pipes now works for bis living in a ginger
beer factory, and why Mrs. Biver hasn’t been able
as yet to pav for the repair of her windows, and
why Mrs, Pipes’ girl was afterwards locked up
for two days in her mother's coal-hole, and It also
accounts for the rage of Mrs. Banks, who came
round and requested in vain that Mrs. Pipes
would give up her daughter for an hour or so that
she and Mrs. Biver might “go for her” jointly
throughout that periodi And it also explains a
lot of other things,which,have served to seriously
diminish the flow of charity in Auckland.

wrote to the papers, saying that the offer was a
noble one,, and in order to mark his sense of ap-
preciation of the magnificent example he was pre-
pared to give £lO,OOO to the Patriotic Fund, on
condition that 10' other persons did likewise. But
neither the 20 with their £lOOO apiece nor the (0
with their £lO,OOO rolled uo, and the Patriotic

* The Bulletin poet—not Shakespeare.
Weep as we unfold a story,
Freely shed your bitter tears—
Shakspeare was a bloated Tory,
William reverenced the Peers ;
He rejoiced o'er regal function,
Winked his eye at royal job,
And remark, in this coni unction —
William couldn’t bear the mob.
He was very fond of telling
(As you've seen above, perhaps)
How their breath was evil smelling
And perspiration soiled their caps
(In chose days, the poet guesses,*
Of which shattered William speaks,
Workingmen had greasy tresses—
Odorised their breath with leeks).

Pail Ups understands the Bard
Who has - deuce a one can doubt it—
Forfeited our kind regard.
What becomes of William’s glory
And his reputation fair,
If he was a bloated Tory ?
Vanished into thinnest air.

Never more revere his name—
He has fallen down to zero
On the little glass of fame.
Years ago to rest they laid him—

Fortune is a fickle jade,
Pranks on us she’s often played —
Puts us in a pickle ;
Now she soiiles, now she frowns —
Gad ! we’ve seen some ups and downs,
Fortune’s very fickle.
Some are lucky, some are not;
Fellows thrive, then go to “pot”—
Often die in ditches ;
Others, from commencements small,
Rise to lord it over all—
Eavied for their riches.

We are full of fancies quaint,
Queer, and comic—very.

Wo are thinking of a time
When young Graham Berry
Sold potatoes by the pound

Id was in the “ fifties ”
He sst up that little store) —
What a change from days of yore !
Yet the “ gab ” a gift is.
Graham Berry—here’s his health !
Started not with worldly wealth,
Was not even well-born.
Does his life a lesson teach 1
Yea—if you can make a speech,
You’ll succeed in “Mel-bawne,”

(There he differs from the bard—
Modest is your poet;
He, whose eyes in frenzy roll,
Keeps his music in hia soul
Has trumpet, but can’t blow it).
To resume whore we left off—
Graham came to be a “ toff"
By methods most erratic ;
With the “gabby ” gift endued
Once he swayed the multitude
W ith speeches democratic.
Then the darling of the hour
Lifted into place and power,
“Stumped” and stormed and “skited" ;
Providence appeared to send
Graham as the People's friend —
Tories fled affrighted.
Would that we had boon, when young,
Born with very oily tongue
And principles elastic;
We had prospered then, maybe,
Quite as well as Mister B.

to resiimo, though, onoe again—
Graham did not long remain
A democratic leader;
Like the goods he used to sell
He was fairly weighed, and—well,
Wherefore tell the reader ?
He has altered much of late—
Mixes with the snobbish great
At royal feast and pageant;
A titled Agent-General!
What a lamentable fall
That, from “ general agent ” !
After vending greens and fruit,
Lives to wear a Windsor suit—
A sword and v< Ive-. breeches !
Visits lords, the papers say ;
Awful moral, well a-day 1
This little story teaches,
Holy Moses ! what a drop,
Once we bought at Graham's shop
A cucumber and salad ;
A democrat become a dude 1
Tearfully we must conclude
This very touching ballad.
PARKES’ PATTER' SONG.—“THE GREAT
HI-HAM.”
I have been misrepresented by some persons dis-
conted who avow I’m egotistical, my elo-
quence a sham,
But these libels I will shatter, and I’ll tell you
what s the matter if you’ll listen to the patter
of the Great Hi-Ham,
I lately had a notion to show loyalty* devotion,
and a lot. of other feelings to the people of
this land;
So with heart and brain elated, I a plan originated
for the building of a Centennial Mausoleum
grand.
The Press at first agreed with me, the country
felt the need of me. and all went well until
at last that horrid Bulletin
Denounced me as a blunderer, a public-money
plunderer, my project architectural a little
bit too thin.
My building I've a mind to stop, my plan I am
inclined to drop ; 111 try it for a little tomb,
the public purse will pay ;
But if they raise another row to their opinion I
must bow, and shelve my pretty cemetery for
another day.
To Freetrade once I did incline, but lately I have
seen a sign that folks would like me to impose
some dues Protectionist.
So now Protectionist I turn, for revenues my
fingers burn ; perhaps they’ll wipe the figures
off that big deficit list,
I like all men to know my views, so when I have
no other news about my own pet projects, I
continually talk.
get the House to listen, and my eyes with
triumph glisten, as with impudence superla-
tive I take ’em for a walk ;
But some I never can get round, their blind-side
I have never found ; my poems and my
longest speeches never take them in.
I never take them by surprise, they seem to have
a hundred eyes—l'm talking of the readers of
that awful Bulletin.
They call me egotistical, my imagery mystical,,
the physiog. of a lion and the wisdom of a
lamb :
But I trust that with my patter, oil their libels I
can scatter, and so that is what’s the matter
with the Groat Hi-Ham.

Gracious Queen, to our petition
Give a little heed ;
Pity, pray, that Mayor’s condition,
Which is sad indeed.
Patiently he toiled and .toadied—
Freely scattered gold ;
Others are with honours loaded—
He is in the cold.
Oranges, and nuts, and lollies*
Milk, and buns, and tea—
Medals, mugs, and china dollies
To the kids gave he ;
All for nought he jubilated—
Surely it were right
Such a man should be created
Something—say, a knight!
He was eager in proposing
Every loyal toast
(All of this we are supposing) ;
When he played the host,
Oftentimes his voice has trembled
(Fancy paints the scene)
When he said to guests assembled,
“ Gentlemen, the Queen 1”
Must his fondest hopes be blighted—
Hopes be blighted thus ?
Even now he could be knighted,
Poor benighted cuss!
Gracious Queen, from our petition,
Coldly do not turn ;
Really, his distressed condition.
Gives us much concern.
You are sad when subjects suffer
(So the papers say)—
Would you let this poor old buffer -
Slowly pine away ?

Happy with a tinpot title—
It wouldn t cost a centi

We have always had a sort of impression
that Bi-hop Barry knew the exact locality the
oleomargarine occupied on his little piece of
bread, and so much ’cuter has he becon e since he
last visited this continent that his woedersome
flock begin to think the only purpose of his
last trip to England was the study of new dodges
and “fly” games for antipodean use. He got
several miles ahead of the clerical crowd in synod
assembled, cold-decking them in gorgeous style,
and now he has made a brilliant effort to ringnose
the whole of his fleck in like manner. The Cen-
tennial Fund is bis latest undertaking. It has
been started, like Mayor Young's Jubilee banquet,
about six months before the anniversary it is
alleged to signa'ise, but that is only bis little
London way of being previous to the ungodly,
who will take no thought to the Centennial until
the Centennial totes along this way. This year is
appropriate only to Jubilee Funds, but it will be a
cold day when Bishop Barry nails such a distress-
ful name on to any scheme of his. He knows
that Australians have an unlimited stock of pro-
fanity on tap for anything named “ Jubilee,” and
that’s why he decided to sample their patriotism
by labelling his ecclesiastical cadie the “Centen-
nial.” You bet the children of this world will
have to go to school again if they want to be any
wiser than the modern children of light. This
paragraph seems to have been written by a very
slangy and worldly member of the staff.

Mr. T. N. Fitzgerald, the eminent Mel-

To get your letters in Croydon (North
Queensland) you wait from half-an hour to four or
live hours, and sometimes have to give it best
without getting anything. There is one little hole
through which enquiries, telegrams, stamps,
letters, and papers, are received and delivered,
and this hole is all day long like a beehive, with
from a dozen to two or three hundred diggers
waiting for letters. There is one young man in-
side who behaves with wonderful coolness under
such trying circumstances. Mr. Ridge, the post-
master, has all the telegraphic part to do, some-
times for 24 hours at a stretch. The revenue for
telegrams is £5O a week alone, and the dirty
shanty that is called a post-office, without a single
window or aperture, save the hole aforemen-
tioned, is a proof of how the South governs (I!) the
North.

According to the Evening Noose a Cork
Club is to be started in Sydney. For the benefit
of the uninitiated it mayjbe explained that a Cork
Club—in England at all events—is a gang of
sodden miscreants whose thirst rises up to heaven
like the smoke of a burnt-offering, end whose
souls are cracked and seared with howling, pray-
ing. begging, and cursing on every known and un-
known god for beer —for heaven’s sake, beer. The
members carry a cork apiece, and when two of
them meet they exclaim simultaneously, like a
voice crying in a brewery, “ Corks out I ” The
one who hasn’t got his cork about him has to
shout, but the average member would sooner ap-
pear without his head than without his cork, and
the shouts are very few. Consequently a Cork
Club is generally a corporation with drought-
stricken innards and legs that are bowed down
through much chasing after stray members on the

A few days ago we climbed to the top of
the Sydney post-office tower to see how it felt.
We ascended by means of fearfully spiral stair-
ways—which seemed endless —to the stage where
the cloek is to be, and frem Thence by perpendi-
cular ladders to the dome. The view from the
top is expansive and very giddy, but the observa-
tory is covered with glass and perfectly safe, so
far as falling out is concerned. We did not fall
out. From this height the tramcars looked like
coupled match-boxes and the ’buses like chips
drawn by fleas. The roofs of the buildings looked
dirty and untidy, and the streets narrower and
more corkscrewy like than ever. On the whole, we
don’t like Sydney proper from the post-office
tower. Beyond, where we see green paddocks
and blue sea the scene is enchanting. For a
bird’s eye view we require a city to be well laid
out—like Cabbagegardenopolis, for instance-
before it looks well. Sydney, with its come-by-
j chance streets, can’t stand the test. But all this
doesn’t signify. If there is any sort of a breeze
I going visitors to the tower will be too occupied

treated her as if she had been a statue, admiring
| her in a cold, abstract way, not altogether grate-
ful to a young woman of ardent tempemment.
Months passed, their relations undergoing no
change, he contented, she discontented. Mean-
while he had engaged Millais, with whom, as a
pre-Raphaelite, he was much impressed, to paint
her portrait. The susceptible artist was struck
by her beauty, and fell passionately in love with
her. But, loyal to his friend, he showed her only
the conventional respect that was due, stifling the
hunger of his heart. Ruskin was at last aroused
to his own marital defects, and to a sense of the
mutual love between his wife and the painter.
He acted magnanimously, deciding not to stand
in the way of the happiness of two persons who
were fitted for one another. Tne matter was
managed quietly, and in due time she was re-
leased from her matrimonial bonds, and became
Mrs. Millais. The celebrated artist having been
knighted, she is now Lady Millais. The three
have been good friends ever since. This item is
specially designed for the edification of the bald-
headed old gentleman who will marry with sweet

There was a time in the pious land of
Scoatlan’ when a young man who wanted to dis-
sipate used to go out to funerals, but when Mel-
bourne wants to enjoy itself it turns cut en masse
to watch the police raking for the corpse of a
drowned girl in the muddy, yellow Yarra. Last
Sunday week the Victorians rolled up by thou-
sands in omnibuses, cabs, carts, special trams,
and Bath chairs to watch the search for the re-
mains of Laura Swain, and every time a dog or
cat which had been wrecked on a snag was
brought to the surface a sort of pleasant thrill
went through the company, and mothers held up
their children to look at the relic which would
point a moral on the hearthrug no more. And
when at last the poor, draggled, disfigured re-
mains were fished out and disposed as decently as
possible on a litter, there was such a rush that the
police had to fight to prevent the corpse being
overturned and trodden under foot.

Dr. Youl, the Melbourne City Coroner,
wears an overcoat so constructed as to be
well-fitted for its office inasmuch as it covers him
from head to foot The Doctor has these coats
built for himself specially, and so one day when
he was visiting a patient and had left his coat in
the dog-cart he was pretty wroth at finding it
gone. He, however, cannily observed a cab-rank
close by, and treasured up the little fact in his
miod. Soon the weather got terribly cold, and
off the doctor started in his leisure moments to
inspect the cab-ranks in general, and the one ho
had noticed in particular. At last his eye rested
on the familiar garment. “Where did you get
that coat, man?’ asked the doctor. “It isn’t
yours,” observed the man ; “look at the lining.”
“On, indeed!’ said the doctor; “new lining,
thank you ; look at the sleeve under the arm.
Yes, my bit of red silk which I have sewn in on
purpose to identify. Quite sufficient. Hand it
over.” Cabby did so, and said. “ Well, you’ve
got your coat.” “ Yes,” said the Doctor Coroner ;
" and you’ll get six months.” And so he did.

covered with a Panama hat about three feet in

Randwick mashers don’t look a bit like docks,
after all. The dissipated son of debauched parents,
there is not much to be said for the Duke of
Hamilton either in his private capacity or as a
hereditary institution. But he is a true aristocrat,
with a childlike faith in his native importance
which rises superior to questions of shirt-collars
and cuffs. Can anyone In Sydney saasiety say as
much for himself ? After pausing for a reply, we

at Flemington last year in white ducks Perhaps

The hors 3 that ran away with Miss Jervois,

Amongst scientists, it is now generally believed
that an increasing tendency to subject the aristo-
cracy to indignity is one of the leading charac-
teristics of colonial mokes. Lord Carington no
■doubt knew this when he brought with him from
England his high-stepners, who, having been
trained to treat tbe nobility with every considera-
tion, would never dream of dumping down their
burden among the garbage. By the way, it is
said on good authority that when Mrs. Bottles, of
the Point—Darling Point, you know —heard of the
accident to Miss Jervois, she sympathetically ex-
claimed : “Well, well! how dreadful! But

The siege of the Willow Tree Inn, Sydney,
has been a noble specimen of warfare, second only
to the battle of the Wattle Tree Inn which took
place at Collingwood Fiat. Melbourne, years ago,
and which the oldest inhabitant of the Flat de-
clares to stand unrivalled in the annals of Colling-
wood fights—which is saying a good deal as it
were. The late Tim Mahony, the corporation
contractor, the chief of one of the most power-
ful factions on the Flat, got into a scrape, begorra,
in the Wattle Tree Inn, Perry-street (which was
called after a bishop, by-the-bye), and earned
eternal fame for himself and the whole Mahony
crowd by the way that he floored his opponents.
First brandy flowed, and then—blood I Mahony
was the head of a house of sons almost as numer-
ous as the patriarch Jacob s—big, muscular fel-
lows, who’d “lay you by the heels” as
soon as they’d look at you. Whenever
the Chieftain Mahony was put to bay, or
felt called upon to destroy an insolent
enemy, Tim tipped the word to “the bhoys,” and
presently the Mahonys came in full force and
routed the enemy with great slaughter. At the
“Battle of the Wattle Tree” Tim was severely
wounded by a shell—no, a glass-bottle —that was
discharged at him. A Collingwood poet (for there
are poets on the Fiat, there is a cabman
named Maguire who has thrown off some sporting
ballads in his time) thus epigrammised the occur-
rence :
11 On Collingwood Flat, at the sign of the Wattle,
■ Poor Mahoney flt the effects of the bottle —
The glass passed without, the P.B. down his throttle.’’
As ,may be supposed, a man like Tim Mahony,
fond of a fight, be jahers, and often finding him-
self in the thick of a good one, frequently figured
in the courts, like. Here he had often to en-
counter the witty barrister, B C. Aspinall, and to
hear this Victorian Curran talk about Mahony
to a jury was as good as a play. Aspinall always
referred to Tim as “ Mahony, the retired Fenian,”
giving the long sound to the “ o.” Tim was a
good-hearted fellow for all his fighting.

The Public Service Act killed political

judge’s associate, for which there are half-a-dozen
eligible men in the service, whilst he is taken out
of a solicitor’s office and asked to accept his £3OO a

The Melbourne Telephone Company has
been bought out by Government for a round sum
of £40,000. As the Company originally asked for
£86,000, the deal smells less fishy than many in
which Her Majesty’s Ministers dispose of the pub-
lic sugar. In the interests of morality, too, it is
well that the sale was effected. For a long time
past Melbourne telephones have been instruments
of the Evil One, causing much hatred and malice,
in addition to uncharitableness. Jones desired
perhaps to breathe some instructions about barbed
wire, or tinned salmon, or stationery, to Brown in
the next street. He rang up Exchange. “ Are
you there ?” came in a mellifluous murmur from
the maiden at head-quarters. “Put me onto
Brown, number 20,009.” said Jones Then the
trouble commenced with a delusive double ring
informing the sufferer that he was “switched” to
Robinson. Jones would commence talking barbed
wire, or salmon, or stationery, and the other fel-
low would reply with long yarns about “ladies’
uppers.” Then both would blow “ d—d 1”
into the receiver and ring off. Five
minutes interval, and Jones came up
smiling for another round. Another “ Are
you there?” of dulcet sweetness “ Con-
nect me with Brown,” said Jones. “You want
him again, all right”—this from the maiden in
mdd exoostulation. Two rings and more Robin-
son. Mora curses and ringing off. Another in-
terval of five minutes. More “ Exchange ” and
“ Are you there 1” Two rings and more Robin-
son. Mqre curses and so ad infinitum. There
was (and still is) no doing anything to speak of
with a Melbourne telephone. Many a young girl
lias lost the blush of innocence through Pa having
the wire laid on to his suburban residence. In-
stead of taking Pa’s instructions from the office
touching a postponement of feeding time, Cissy
would catch the echoes of distant blasphemy from
sources unknown. OI it was awful. If he can
but reconstruct that Telephone concern on a re-
ligious basis, the Victorian Postmaster General
will save more souls than a missionary.

Love is a devouring element which
bloweth whithersoever it listeth. It plays up
with mobled Queens (Isabella of Spain is a case
in point), and finds its way through the calm ex-
terior of fashionable jockeys like Tom Hales.
There never was a girl so amiable that she did
not exhibit symptoms of tender passion when a
blue-eyed masher of unmarried aspect lent her
half his hymn-book at evening service. Even the
policeman on his lonely beat is not proof against
the sweet appeal of Love, especially when it
carries a flask of rum in its ulster pocket. This
brings us to our point. Burglars and other arti-
sans are mere puppets in the adroit hands of
Venus. The Victorian police have “ copped ”
some letters intended for gentlemen languishing
in Pentridge, and these letters are rich in the
particular touches of nature which make the
whole world kin. One of them is signed, “ Your
true girl, Dark But this is quite prosaic
compared with the epistle of “ Pat ” to his “ Dear
Mick and Barney.” At the time of writing Pat
was just about leaving Melbourne for Sydney
on account of things in general being
“ red-hot.” Pat proceeds to say, “ I told
you in one of my stiffs that I was not
going with Bess, but that I was going with Sarah
Musgrove. Since then me and Muegrove have
split up. Of course you both know I am more
sneaked on Bess than any other hart, so very
naturally I sent for her to day to bid her good-
bye, as I did not want to part bad friends with the
old girl ,So she sent me a stiff and it knocked me
silly.” There’s a soft ’art for you. When the
ladies get their rights and sit on juries (they only
sit on jurymen at present) we foresee a good time
for Pat, however it may go with that nasty, for-
ward minx. Dark Eyes. What jury of matrons
would convict Pat on suspicion, after hearing his
pretty prattle about being “ knocked silly ” by the
“ bart ” ? Why, we almost cotton to the bloomin’
chump ourselves. “ Sneaked ”on Bess, is he ? It
won’t be so long before Bess will reciprocate his
passion by sneaking on him.

The reverend gentleman who was hauled
up at Newtown, Sydney, last week on a charge of
wife desertion, seems to be a man born to trouble.
For many years he says his wife has gone on

no congregation, no collection, no nothing. Dur-
ing the course of his married life Mrs. Clergyman
flew at her husband with a knife, and threw bread
at his head, and ran after him with a plate, and
said she would split him open. Also she stated
that she would do for him, and hit him with a
buggy-wrench, and otherwise held him up to the
public guffaw, and she concluded her career of
iniquity by t-uing the poor, old stranded parson
for £l a week maintenance. This, of course, is
theicv gentleman’s story; the lady heiself re-
presents that she is a patient, smitten angel whom
the parson has been trying to bounce into a pre-
mature grave, and that she only bears up under
her load of affliction by keeping a hoarding house.

Mr. Henniker Heaton, M.P. for Canter-
bury in the House of Commons, who, with Mrs.
Heaton, arrived from England by the mail
steamer Rome, is to be banqueted in Sydney. We
presume that the gathering, which bids fair to he
a large and successful one, is intended to bo
purely friendly and non-political, and to mark the
promoters’ sense of the many good and generous
traits in Mr. Heaton’s character —the pro-
fuse hospitality he has indiscriminately ex-
tended to Australian visitors to England
simply because they were Australians in a strange
land ; and, no doubt, it is also desired to make
the affair a tribute to the undying energy which
has contributed so much to ye Henniker’s success.
So far, the movement will gain a large support,
hut there had better be no attempt to Justify the
change of front by which Mr. Heaton, who went
to England as an Australian Liberal, has returned
a blue-moulded Coercionist Tory.

At Oakleigh (Yic,), the other day, Miss
Marion Tonks, daughter of Mr. Richard 'tonka,
of Oatlanda (Tas ), was married to Mr. John
James Lee, of Rockdale, England. Mr. Lee may
take credit to himself for having secured a real
Tasmanian beauty—a race nearly extinct. The
lady was well-known in Hobart a few years ago
and greatly admired, the usual verdict on aspiring
beauties being then: “She is not as pretty as
Miss Tonks.”

A young doctor who has lately bought a
practice in a country town came home in high
glee the other n’ght, “Do you know, my dear,’’
he said to his wife, “I'm really becoming quite
well-known here. The undertakers how to me
already.”
* * *
At Oatlands (las.), on Ist inst., Miss
Marion Campbell, daughter of Rev. L. Campbell,
was married to Mr. Gilbert E. Butler, M.R.C.S.,
son of the late Dr. Butler, Speaker of the Tas-
manian House of Assembly. The bride was at-
tired in ivory poult de-soie, trimmed with tulle
and orange blossom. Her bridesmaids wore
pretty grey cashmere dresses, relieved with dif-
ferent colours.

There seem to be only several things the
matter with Sydney Children’s Hospital. The first
is the aristocratic business—the arbitrary sorting-
out of the nurses into Browns and “Miss”
Browns —the second is too much ornamental lady
superintendent, and too little plain “matron.” The
third is the absence of a resident doctor. The
fourth and most serious trouble is too much
Wilkinson. It would be well for the hoard to
procure the services of some fat, round and ruddy
widow on the shady side of.forty, who has made—
and eaten—lots of pies in—say—Devonshire, who
has never written a line of poetry in her life, who
doesn't know anyone who contributes to the news-
papers, and who has never heard of nervous
debility, to look after the kids. Then put up an
extra room at the hospital and engage some
fatherly-looking old bachelor doctor with blue
goggles as resident. The rest will he easy. In
Ihe result, the doctor will marry the matron, and
the show will be run on family principles.
The Board of Management of Sydney
Children’s Hospital, it has been remarked, con-
sists of a number of gentlemen who wear petti-
coats, three or four women who wear trousers,
and four legally qualified medical practitioners.

The other day we heard that George Dar-
rell was very angry with somebody for producing
a version of “ Tne Soggarth’ at a London theatre,
under the name of “ The Oath.” It was even
stated that George intended going home to take
proceedings against the wicked author of this
literary outrage. Now it appears “The
Oath” man is accused of stealing his plot from a
poem called “Fa'her Roacb,” which was itself
founded on a story written by Charles Lover
From this same story Mr. Finn, of Melbourne,
filched the yarn which he declared was the source
of Gaorge Darrell's divdne work. Among them
all Samuel Lover would appear to he the man
with the substantial grievance.

A pair of curtains costing £4O was re-
cently ordered for one of the Minis erial resi-
dences at Wellington, N.Z., but was rejected ss
not good enough by the mistress of the establish-
ment, and a more expensive artie’e procured. The
rejected curtains are now lying in the Public
Works store awaiting the date on which they will
be utilised as dusters.

A social meeting of milkmen was held at
the Maiaon Dorte, Melbourne, the other evening.
Several tcasta were proposed and honoured, but
not the slightest allusion was made to “ The
Pump.” Taere is no gratitude in milkmen. We
suppose they are not built that whey.

1 his is what a literary man, who went there
to make his fortune, says about Melbourne -
“It is a cold, hard, un genial city. The wide, cheerless
streets ignore you. Tne great buildings stare with a thou-
sand chill unspeculath e eyes at you. Even the prlicemen
are too proudly indifferev.t to Uck you up th ju, h you were
as druna as the devil. It is no place for a man of tine feel-
ings to live in.”
From this we infer that the writer has not made
his fortune in Melbourne.
The Queen has “sacked” the Scotch
Browns and engaged the Indian blacks.
The Rev. Barnier was in the thick of the
discussion on the Reredos at the Sydney Synod.
But he was only one of many barneyers.
“ What kind of constituency should F.
Abigail represent ?” A rabbit burrow, of course.
Or a rabid borough might do.
Last week Mr. Bucknell, spiritualist, an-
nounced that he would “ lecture on his experience
with Miss Woods.” It’s to be hoped Mr. B.’s ex-
perience was pleasant.
Wc have received the first number of the
Canterbury Courier and Burwood. Asbfleld,
Croydon, Summer Hill, Petersham, Canterbury,
Enfield, Fivedock, Concord, Mortlake, Strathfleld,
Homebqsh, Kogarah, and Ilurstville Advocate,
and the bruise which now disfigures our dexter
eye is all owing to it, for the title of the ne w
paper tangled round our legs as we entered the
office yesterday morning and brought us down.
That was the first we heard of the new venture.
The Canterbury Courier and tobe-continued-in-
our-next Advocate is a modest 8 page paper, and
contains a certain amount of reading which will
probably be found interesting in wet weather in
the suburbs. It is run by Messrs. Moss Brothers,
of Burwood, though how men of four letters
hope to tack against a south-east gale with such
a spread of canvas is more than we can compre-
hend, unless they take the name about in a dray.
Bishop Stanton had a packed I house on
Sunday, August 14, at Croydon, N.Q, In the
Qvening he preached a diggers’ sermon, earnest
and eloquent, without a trace of dogmatism of
any sort, and actually proposed that the church
to be started should be used as a reading-room
during the week. The miners like him, and listened
attentively throughout. The Bishop went to Nor-
manton on the Tuesday. He actually offered to
appoint a parson to be chosen by the miners !
Michael Quinlan, who was recently ac-
quitted on a charge of murdering his wife at
Hotham (Yic.), has been refused admission to the
Melbourne Benevolent Asylum. He informed the
committee that his friends refused to recognise
him, and that he was homeless and penniless.
He should have pleaded that he was a poor lone-
some widower with nobody to take care of him.
Quinlan has found to his bitter cost that the taint
of blood cannot be washed off by the verdict of a
Jury.

How to Gain Flesh and Strength.— Take after each
meal about a tablespoonful of “Scott’s Emulsion of
Pure Cod Liver Oil With Hypophosthites.” It is
almost as palatable as milk, and easily digested. The
rapidity with which delicate children and sickly people
suffering from weakness and wasting diseases improve and
thrive upon this diet, is truly marvellous. As a remedy for
Consumption, Throat Affections and Bronchitis, it is un-
equalled by any other preparation in the world. Use it and
try your weight. All chemists sail large and small bottles.*

The Progress or New South Wales —At present
Unre are 1,407 miles of railway in operation; there are
11,639 miles of telegraph wire; 425 State Schools, with 1,161
Teachers. These statistics, though of a miscellaneous
character, te'tify to the growth and vigour of this youthful
colony. It is easy to understand amid so many worsing
classes and gr wing children, how valuable and useful a
medicine is which possesses the property of checking and cur
ing those diseases peculiar to New South Wales itself or in-
cidental to life generally. This however is the characteristic
of Freeman a Original Chlorodyne. and has secured for it in
New South Wah s a reputation of the highest character. No
other medicine has obtained a similar position in any other
colony and no colonists have spoken in higher praise of the
virtue of Freeman’s Chlorooyne than the residents, the
manufacturers, the shepherds, and the miners of New
Zealand. Its value in the Nurserv and in Female Com-
plaints can scarcely be estimated.—Sold everywhere through-
out the Colonies. Insist upon having “ Freeman’s” only.

SPLENDID STOCK OF WINTER GOODS.
Fashionable Garments to Order at Moderate Prices
THE fourth chapter, and end of our self-imposed
task. It has been a duty undertaken on
account of those who have so long encouraged us
with their support. It was last Saturday we com-
menced the essay, and we pledged our reputation
to continue it, chapter by chapter, until we had
thoroughly exhausted the subject. We thought
three chapters would have sufficed, but find it
takes four.
Last Saturday’s issue saw the first part of our
essay upon HOW AND WHERE TO FURNISH
THOROUGHLY, SAFELY andEOONOMICALLY;
and in that issue, as the result of serious study
and careful deliberation we gave our readers a
descriptionjof the Carpet and Floorcloth floors upon
the 5ch storey of the Great Central Emporium,
Sydney.
We omitted giving the address in the first issue,
but do so now, viz., LAWLER'S, 608 George-
street, Sydney. An old-established house, es-
tablished as long ago as 1860, and situate in the
centre of the city right between Liverpool and
Bathurst streets. A commanding and imposing
edifice, and stocked from floor to ceiling
Monday's issue treated of the extraordinary
stock of bedsteads, wire-mattrestes and bedding,
upon the floor of the 1th siorey; and Wednesday’s
issue dealt exclusively with the Bedroom Furniture
upon the floors of the 3rd storey. And now we
have to treat of the Dining and Drawing room
furniture and Library and Office appointments
upon the floors of the 2nd storey.
This last chapter is the one that claims the at-
tention of our readers, and we will be as brief but
explanatory as possible. LAWLER’S Suites differ
from most suites met with in Sydney houses, and
remind us on account of their solidity and fulness
of upholstery of the suites made before the age for
slop upholstery became general.
We have had our attention called to a magnifl-
cent solid walnut diningroom suite with misletoe
carvings and carved and moulded legs set with
best coppered wire springs, upholstered throughout
in curled horsehair, and covered in the best
Russian dressed real morocco, finished with
morocco binding and morocco-covered studs. The
suite was made for one of our well-known mer-
chant princes and was sold to him for £65. It
looked all out well worth 90 guineas, a figure one
of the furnishing salesmen declared he had re-
peatedly sold the suites at in London, Leeds and
Edinburgh. There is another Suite just being
completed in the factory, the couch and a few
chairs of which we were shown, and we have no
hesitation in declaring it to be the best upholstered
suite we have ever seen. No one with money
could resist it. It is a glorious suite, splendidly
finished and boldly conceived, and only £60. It
would be cheap at £80. w e felt bound to admit
that it was stupid purchasing at auction sales
when LAWLER’S celebrated light oak or walnut
or real mahagony specialty—the Emporium
Leather Suite at £27 10s., could be had direct
from the factories In Union-lane. There are
Diningroom Suites all made and upholstered upon
the premises in oak, walnut or Mahogany, and in
crimson or olive Utrecht velvets at £21 10a. and
£a7 10s. And there are mahogany and cedar
Diningroom Suites in the best English made hair-
cloth, or in Oockett’s maroon or green-colored
leather-cloth at £12 10s., £11 10s. and £17. LAW-
LER'S set their face against turning out suites in
hair-cloth at anything less than £12 10s., saying
they would only have to resort to common German-
made seating it they were to manufacture hair-
cloth suites at a penny less than £12 10s.
Our readers ought all to bear in mind the im-
portant fact that they can select their frames at
LAWLER’S and choose whatever covering they
think fit, and can call round at any time and see
the work in the upholsterer’s hands.
We would remind those who prefer the Austrian
Suites to upholstered Suites that they can have
one of those grand and luxurious Couches, the
Eugenie, at £3 19s., and capitally suited for an
after-dinner smoke or nap they are. Long and
broad—a perfect nest of spiral springs, the head as
well as the seat being so upholstered.
This Eugenie Couch of LAWLER’S, at £3 19s.
a perfect marvel of value and to show the esteem
in which it is held we have only to remark that
since LAWLER reduced the price from £5 5s. to
to £3 19s , the present low price—since he reduced
the Eugenics to £3 19s. he has sold 200 and odd of
them, or an average of five a week.
We have no intention of referring to Sideboards
or Dinner Waggons; nor were we inclined to taka
up much of our important Saturday’s space with
Extending and Telescopic Dining Tables, buthaving
been shown a few very special lines we think It
our duty to name them.
Frst there is the Hotel Sideboard, 6ft. long, with
glass back, bracket shelf, enclosed cupboards and
drawers, all solid cedar, price £8 10s. Then there
is the Cottage Sideboard, with large glass back,
cellarette cupboard and drawer enclosed, brackets
for ornaments, &c., &c., £11 10s. and £12 10s.
There are Cottage Sideboards at £3 15s. and £5
5s. And for mansions a range of best made Side-
boards in walnut, oak and mahogany at £17 10s.,
£25, £27 10a., £35. There are massive Sideboards
in pollard oak with all the latest improvements,
of bold design, faithfully built, with immense
bevelled glass back, collarettes, &c., &c., at £15.
Bookcases and Cylinder Writing Desks in oak,
walnut and mahogany. Dinner Waggons, in the
same woods.
A grand stock of elegaht Pierglasses and Over-
mantels.
But what surprised us most was the quantity
of Drawingroom Furniture, Suites, Cabinets
Brackets, Tables &c, turned out by LAWLER’S.
The turn-over of the establishment with its
different departments, its wonderful Boot and
Shoe floor, the Furniture, Carpets and Bedsteads,
the Ironmongery and Glass and China, the Drapery
and Clothing and Hats and Caps must be some-
thing extraordinary.
Upwards of 100 Drawingroom Suites turned
out in 12 months, and ranging in quality, style
and price from the simple but serviceable Repp
Suites at £10 10s. to the prettiest and most
effective Occasional and Harlequin Suites
Parisian tapestries or plushes at £15.
As in Diningroom Suites, LAWLER’S will not
turn out anything under £12 10s. so with
Drawingroom Suites, they will not touch any-
thing under £10 10s. LAWLER’S hold that the
customer who pays more than £65 for the pro-
duction of the best of Morocco Dining-room Suites,
or above £50 for the loveliest and most charming
of delighful special things in Drawingroom Suite
deserves to be declared a “Tittlebat Titmouse’
and fit prey for high-toned but unprincipled
furnishing “Oily Gammons.” And we think so
too.
Time and space—that is newspaper space—i
pretty much like time and tide, will wait for
none; so that, although we wpuld like to refer
to Cabinets. Whatnots, Music Canterburys and
a thousand other articles, we arc compelled to end
our essay by repeati- ig at its close the words with
which we commeuad—viz., that the place at
which to furnish safely, surely, thoroughly,
economically and wel l is

Snow-shoe racing is the latest sporting

doubt of this, for further along we read “ The

Eastwood was leading for three-parts of the race,
when she came down, turning heels over head.”

Dear Bulletin, — I see that that most
erudite and reliable paper, the T. and C. Journal,
has every week a word or two, in fact, a good
many lines, about the Prison Puzzle, said to have
been considered soluble by Proctor. Although I
often find a grain (minim) of truth in the journal
in question, I cannot imagine that any mathema-
tician ever gave himself away by stating that he
believed there is a solution to a manifest impossi-
bility, But the Coonamble people have bsen
exercised for months by a conundrum propounded
by a tailor who has had free liquors up to last
week during the discussion of it. This is the
puzzle :—“ A little girl states that a certain boy is
the son ot her father and of her mother, but that
she is not his sister. What is she ?” Last Satur-
day night the wit and wisdom of the town as-
sembled to hear the answer and to have a final try
at it. After six whiskies our decimal one repeater
(1-9*) of a man gave out that she could only be
one thing—viz , an extravasated little liar, and
tuch s»iso is the opinion of yours, Scotty the
Wrinkxer.
