CHEMIST TELLS RECIPE FOR FAMILY
COUGH REMEDY.
HELP PEOPLE SAVE MONEY.
Here’s a recipe, given by a leading
chemist, that will enable people to make the
best family cough remedy, and at the same
time save much money. Everybody knows
that a good cough and influenza remedy
consists of two main sections:—
The first section is the undiluted med-
icinal ingredients; and the second is, of
course, the necessapy water and sweetening.
The preparation of the medicinal ingredi-
ents requires trained knowledge, but the
water and sweetening can be added in the
home just as easily as in the pharmacy.
And you save a lot of money by doing so.
Now, prove these facts by trying this
HEENZO recipe: Into a jug put four
tablespoonfuls of sugar, three of either
treacle or honey, two of vinegar, and a large
breakfastcupful of warm water. Stir till
dissolved, and when the syrup is quite
cold pour into a large bottle, and then add
a two-shilling bottle of concentrated
HEENZO, obtained from your chemist or
store. By doing this you will have a family
supply equal in quantity and superior in
quality to eight ordinary-sized bottles of
the best ready-mixed cough remedy, but,
if purchased in the usual way, would cost
up to £l. An outstanding feature about
HEENZO is the fact that it is a safe
remedy for babies as well as adults, and
over 12,000 people have written letters
proclaiming it the best remedy they have
ever used for quickly banishing coughs,
colds, croup, bronchitis, and influenza.—

FACTS!
The only type of
circulation that
has veal worth is that which is constant and
embodies the confidence of readers. These
attributes are possessed only by the daily
newspapers whose circulations are derived, not
by contests, insurance schemes, or high pres-
sure methods, but by real merit. They are
bought , because people want them in their
homes.
The daily newspaper
is so essential
to the New Zealander that even in times of
econorpic stress he continues to buy his
morning daily, so valuable is it for the
information it gives, both in its news and
advertisement columns.
Newspaper advertising is the most economical,
effective and forcible medium for reaching
the New Zealand public.

HIS BOOKS
The English Countryside
Do you think of going to England?
Or are you an armchair tourist? In
either case you will get enjoyment and
points of view from the works dis-
cussed below. One who visits or reads
about, say, an ancient Oxford or Cam-
bridge college without knowledge of its
historical background misses half the
fun. Two of these books supply back-
grounds, the third is a rapturous inven-
tory of places of interest, and the fourth
is a commination service on modern Eng-
lish architecture. Among them they give
a fairly complete picture of the way Eng-
land’s face has changed in a thousand
years.
Primitive England
The Evolution of the English House,
by Sidney Oldall Addy (Allen and Un-
win ; 12s. 6d.), is the standard work on
native English dwellings. This fine edi-
tion, which has been revised and enlarged
from the author’s notes by John Sum-
merson, has a foreword by Clough Wil-
liams-Ellis, and many interesting photo-
graphs and line drawings.
The rectangular house —the humble
forebear of the cathedral —evolved
from “the temporary booth or tent
built by shepherds.” In structures
such as Teapot Hall in Lincolnshire,
which still stands, the s bay (con-
sisting of two pairs of bent trees
fixed in the ground and united at their
apexes by a ridge-tree) was the archi-
tectural unit, and, incidentally, the
inspiration of the Gothic arch. A
one-bay dwelling could be enlarged in-
definitely by the addition of other bays,
and so, with increasing wealth and stan-
dards of comfort, England achieved the
minor country house. Two- and three-
storey houses arrived in response to the
limited environments created by the de-
fensive walls of the towns, just as sky-
scrapers have arrived in response to the
soaring values of limited city areas.
This book goes no further than the
castles, keeps and manors of Norman
times, but it deals exhaustively and learn-
edly with their origins.
Bath and Thereabouts
To turn from Mr. Addy’s classic to
This Was England, by Horace Annesley
Vachell (Hodder and Stoughton;
Dymock’s; Bs. 6d.), is like leaving a
science lecture for a movie. It is lyric
in its enthusiasm for the England of
other days. Or, rather, for part of it.
Just as Mr. Addy only shows the Eng-
lish house in its early stages, so Mr.
Vachell only shows a small part of Eng-
land —the country round Bath, where he
lives. “Charm,” he remarks at the end,
“has played the will-o’-the-wisp with me,
dancing ahead of each page, evading my
grasp, in sight but out of intimate
touch.”
In point of fact his book is compact
of charm ; it reads like the table-talk of
one who unites in his own person the
whimsical amiability of an A. A. Milne,
the sturdy Englishism of a Kipling and
the erudition of a professor of history.
Sydneyites will be interested to learn that
“Thomas Greenway, a stonecutter, may
have built” Mr. Vachell’s home, Wid-
combe Manor. The stonecutter was an
ancestor of Macquarie’s convict-architect,
The author doesn’t describe Bath and
its frequenters according to an ordered
plan, as Edith Sitwell did —just flits here
and there, with a word about the gor-
geous clothes of the beaux and belles of
George ll.’s reign ;an excursion to some
other city or county ; a reference to the
Bath of 1730 (“little more than a small
town”); a literary criticism, or a few
remarks about hedgehogs, saints and
their Days, swans and anything else
that happens to occur to him. A para-
graph begins “Our dahlias are gorgeous,”
goes on to discuss the Bath sunflower,
and ends with some observations on a
Roman bath in his sunk garden, and the
complacent reflection: “Verily our lines
lie in pleasant places.”
The places are
so uniformly plea-
sant that a false
impression is con-
veyed both of the
England that was
and the England
that is. Still, it is a delightful book ; as
delightful as a romantic film with a
lovely heroine, a handsome hero and no
gangsters.
Modern England and Scotland
In one respect John Prioleau in
Enchanted Ways (Dent; 55.) outdoes Mr.
Vachell. To him all England and Scot-
land are beyond criticism. Nothing up-
sets him. He admits that in the Peak
country on a Sunday the seeker after
loveliness may “be beset on every side
by cars and motor-cycles, by walking
picnic parties, by parties of all kinds
complete with portable wireless sets and
gramophones.” No matter.
It takes more than a few hundred humans,
and their machines, to spoil the grandeur of
the Peak country.
In this spirit he surveys Worcester in
apple time, the west coast of Scotland,
the castles of Kent, the glories of Dart-
moor. If there is a more hideous part of
rural England than Bognor and environs
this critic doesn’t know it, yet Bognor
and the outskirts of Worthing receive
a warm tribute. He even finds beauty
in “that wonderful highway where every-
one seems to sell clothes” (meaning the
Mile End-road), and in the Essex flats!
Some Painful Truths
It is rather a relief to turn from the
bromides of Mr. Prioleau to John Bet-
jeman, an authority and a realist. His
theme is indicated in the title of his book,
Ghastly Good Taste , or a Depressing
Story of the Rise and Fall of English
Architecture (Chapman and Hall ; 55.).
He doesn’t agree that (he English land-
scape is a thing of unadulterated beauty.
It is being ruined by mob-refinement.
Simplicity and honesty in architecture
died with Nash, or shortly afterwards,
and Nash’s masterpieces* are being torn
down as zestfully in London as buildings
of his school are being torn down in
Sydney. Death sentences were passed on
Carlton House Terrace and Burdekin
House at about the same time.
The suburbs of every manufacturing town,
the pretentious villa trying to look like a. bit of
East Ham in Melbury Bubb, every front door
imitating the window of a parish church, every
name in glass above it these are the pro-
ducts of speculative building.
The visitor even to remote cities like
Exeter passes miles of overdressed cot-
tages, differentiated only by some such
decoration as a set of Grecian pillars sup-
porting nothing ; filling stations as ugly
as any in this country; chewed hedges;
bleak little pubs. It is worse on the out-
skirts of the great centres of population,
and everywhere the villas are creeping
out from country towns to meet the
villas of the cities.
English beauty, in the old sense of pat-
terned English prettiness, exists to-day
rather in the mind of the sentimentalist
than in the eye of the beholder. Uni-
versal education, mechanisation and the
super-tax have pretty well done their
work. “Architecture,” says Mr. Betje-
man, “can only be made alive again by
a new order and a new Christendom,”
and he doesn’t think this generation will
see either of them.

Aldous Huxley
Aldous Huxley’s Texts and Pretexts
(Chatto and Windus: Robertson and
Mullens ; 7s. 6d.) is interesting as much
for what it reveals of its author as for
the objective value of its contents. It is
an anthology of extracts from English,
French, Italian and Latin poetry, with
commentaries. Huxley’s judgment is acute,
his sympathies are wide. There is little
he doesn’t know about sex, society, God,
philosophy. One gets the impression that
there is hardly anything in human rela-
tionships about which he would not have
something apposite to say. He is an up-
to-the-minute intellectual, and sometimes
shows a better theoretical understand-
ing than any of his fellow intellectuals.
He had the advantage of being an in-
timate friend of D. H. Lawrence. Con-
tact with that phenomenal being struck

a spark out of him and produced his
most authentic book, “Brave New
World.” It is true that that debated book,
as far as its subject-matter goes, appears
to be only an enlarged paraphrase of a
chapter in Bertrand Russell’s “Scientific
Outlook.” But it was obviously written
with conviction and got its driving force
from a genuine emotion, which is why
it shocked the Australian Customs.
And Huxley not only has an intellec-
tual acquaintance with almost every
human problem that besets other people
—he is capable of standing on one side
and coldly analysing himself with the de-
tachment of a biologist examining a col-
lection of cells under a microscope.
“Point Counterpoint” is obviously a book
of thinly veiled biographies. Huxley him-
self is Philip Quarles, who understands
all the emotions a father ought to feel at
the tragedy of his child’s death by cere-
bro-spinal meningitis but is incapable of
experiencing them.
Huxley is essentially a school product.
He knows a million more facts than were
available to Socrates.
This cargo of other men’s ideas might
not hamper a genius like Goethe ; it is a
serious burden for a lesser man. The
artist is greater the more he can remain
on the intuitive level. Huxley’s failure
to be a first-class writer goes hand-in-
hand with his popularity as a purveyor
of the latest scientific and philosophic
notions.
F.S.
A Japanese Classic
The Lady Murasaki lived about nine
centuries ago, and wrote with subtlety,
gaiety and humor The Tale of Genji,
which has been placed by critics of worth
among the 12 great novels of the world.
Arthur Waley is responsible for the
translation, and the various bdoks have
been published by Allen and Unwin at
10s. 6d. each under such charming and
intriguing titles as “The Sacred Tree,”
“The Wreath of Cloud,” “Blue Trousers,”
“The Lady of the Boat.” The introspec-
tive searchings, the spiritual significance
which Murasaki conveys in delicate and
sensitive phrasing, the quickened tempo
of her narrative when the scene is
spirited, her unerring delineation of
character (never was Jane Austen more
observant) bring her characters amaz-
ingly to life.
In “The Sacred Tree” there are vivid
incidents, such as the Service of the Eight
Recitals, which are as unforgettable as
passages of Thackeray, Dickens and Stev-
enson. You feel that the author has
moved and had her being through such
very scenes and has had for company the
Genjis, the Fujitsubos, the priests and
princes of whom she writes.
But it is perhaps the liquid beauty of
the poems into which all her people burst
at the slightest provocation, the amber
honey of speech, that will captivate the
mind of the woman reader. Two lovers
are disturbed.
Outside in the corridors they could hear the
soldiers tramping up and down and calling out
as they went “First hour of the Tiger watch!”
“First hour of the Tiger watch!” Then the
lady whispers, “Though the watchman of the
night cries out ‘Enough!’ yet seems it from
your tears and mine we are not of his mind.”
To the Lady Murasaki, who savored
life so long ago, and found it much the
same vintage we drink to-day, my tribute!
Nora McAULIFFE.
The Cinema As Folk Art
Will Dyson once remarked to me that
the cinema was really a folk theatre, and
I am inclined to think he was right.
Folk art has certain definite charac-
teristics. The Highland fling is folk danc-
ing. Jazz is folk music. A post-and-
rail fence is folk architecture. As such
they are admirable in their way. But if
a Highlander tried to make his move-
ments express as much as Pavlova’s legs,
or if an Australian cocky were to erect
a fence of lonic columns, the result
would be deplorable. This is what the
so-called artistic producers of the film are
continually doing, and when the film
critics view the result and trot out their
most pompous adjectives I permit myself
to sniff.
By common consent Charley Chaplin
is the one artist who has thoroughly
understood the cinema medium, and it
is significant that he never allows himself
to stray from his beat. The only emotion
he portrays is the simple self-pitying
“little man,” the childlike adult who is
perpetually having his illusions destroyed
and replacing them with fresh ones. On
this uncomplex level the screen is an
adequate medium ; in fact, a superb one.
On the question of whether it will ever
rise above this level I preserve an open
mind and a hoping heart. The screen
is an animated photograph. A still photo-
graph is never art. It often tells us in-
teresting facts, especially when it is the
work of a competent news-gatherer of
the pictorial press. When it professes to
be art, as in the shows of amateur “artis-
tic” photographers, it is merely a pre-
tentious imitation in monochrome of
painting.
When we look at an album of family
photographs we are delighted to note
what fat babies we used to be and
are amused at the queer waistcoats
grandpa used to wear ; but we are not in
the realms of art. Perhaps art will some-
day struggle through the maze of mach-
inery which lies in its path on its passage
to the screen. That will be when the
talkie megaphone gives as subtle a render-
ing of the emotions of the human soul
as a fleshly actor’s voice, and when the
moving shadows on the screen give a
colorable illusion of real life.

Fact and Fiction
The manager of the Endeavour Press
contends (B. 26/7/’33) that a publisher’s
job begins and ends with the printing and
distributing of a book, the author being
solely responsible for the accuracy of the
text. As he says, that all novels should
be submitted to experts prior to publica-
tions is ridiculous. The average novel,
no matter how well or how "wretchedly
written, is not marred if the author makes
the sun rise in the wrong quarter or gives
his heroine blue eyes on one page and
brown on the next. Such errors may
irritate the fastidious and the observant,
but as few fiction readers are either, they
don’t much matter.
But historical fiction is different. The
earlier school of historical novelists
deemed accuracy of fact unimportant,
and the same holds good to-day of the
historical romance which depends for its
popularity upon pure sentiment. But,
particularly since the Armistice, a new
school has arisen which eschews distor-
tions of fact and inaccuracy of detail,
although absolute faithfulness is not the
aim. It is not desirable that it should
be ; for, as Ernest Barker has said, if an
author’s puppets are to live and the
story’s action to move there must be “a
free weaving of imagination around the
fact.”
The historical novel, to achieve per-
manent popularity, must display not
only imaginative qualities, but also learn-
ing and research. John Buchan, “E. Bar-
rington” and Mrs. Naomi Mitchison, to
name but three, are historians as well as
novelists, while “Jew Suss” was an out-
standing success because it was a true
mirror of the period with which it dealt.
The modern historical novelist sticks
closely to fact —to such an extent, in
some cases, that emotional values and
the major rhythm of the story suffer.
In my judgment, the publisher, unless
handling the work of an acknowledged
authority, is under a twofqld obligation
to seek expert opinion. Firstly, it is an
ordinary business precaution. The suc-
cess or failure of the book will depend
largely upon how the author has done
his job. Take the case of Ernst Fen-
zoldt’s “The Marvellous Boy,” originally
published in Germany in 1927. The first
English edition was issued by Harrap’s at
10s. 6d. early last year, but so glaring and
numerous were the inaccuracies and dis
tortions that within a fortnight the book
had to be withdrawn. What that cost
the publishers, the Endeavour’s manager
will be able to estimate.
Secondly, the publisher is morally
bound to consult an expert, since he
claims to be issuing a book which gives
a reasonably faithful picture of the past.
If it doesn’t live up to that claim, author
and publisher are equally guilty of mis-
representation. Trivial errors and obvi-
ous slips of memory may be forgiven,
but not wholesale inaccuracies and dis-
tortions. And the publisher who does
obtain expert opinion prior to publication
has an answer to the critic who brands
a book as false to fact.
HENRY BATESON.
A Satchel of Books
The Story of Parramatta, by James
Jervis (The Shakespeare Head Press; 2s.),
begins with the discovery of the Parra-
matta River in February, 1788, and
traces the growth of Parramatta town and
suburbs. There are interesting reproduc-
tions of old photographs, and a map of
early grants with the names of the
grantees.
Toby Cordover is the hero of Laughter
in Heaven, by C. Lloyd-Jones (Heine-
mann; 7s. 6d.). He marries Ruth, who
wasn’t much impressed with him when
she was a flapper in a girls’ camp and he
met her there in his amorous boyhood.
The marriage duly crashes. Fortunately
for Toby there was another girl at the
camp—but don’t let us go into that and
spoil a perfectly good love story. Toby
is particularly well drawn.
The House of Shayle, by John Alex-
ander (Sampson Low: Robertson and
Mullens; 7s. 6d.). Laurette Shayle,
heiress to the ancient house of Shayle,
has been badly brought up. She elopes
with an adventurer. The after-effects of
this false step pursue her through life.
Here we have all the ingredients of a
best-seller —beautiful girl, former lover,
adoring though suspicious husband, theft,
murder and, as the web closes in, suicide.
Great German Short Novels and
Stories, edited by Bennett A. Cerf
(Modern Library; 7s. 6d.). The collection
leads off with “The Sorrows of Werther”
of Goethe. This work of genius was the
first psychological novel ever written.
Like all great innovators, Goethe started
a fashion, and it is interesting to note
how little his imitators understood what
their inspirer was about. “Amok,” by
Stefan Zweig, is a modern imitation. A
German doctor in Java is asked by a
beautiful European woman to perform
an abortion. He demands her virtue as
a fee ; she refuses, and dies as the result
of the ministrations of a native woman.
Guilty conscience obsesses the doctor,
and he suicides in Naples Harbor. The
only real resemblance to Goethe’s work
is the obsession and the suicide. The
rest is without one genuine touch of
nature. The same may be said of Ger-
hart Hauptmann’s “Flagman Thiel.” If
the present collection is representative
there is little in modern German litera-
ture to compare with Heine’s “Gods in
Exile” and the two examples of Nordic
folklore by the brothers Grimm.
Alec Waugh’s latest, Wheels Within
Wheels (Cassell; 7s. 6d.), is a remark-
ably interesting study of the 1929 crisis
and its reaction on the lives of a number
of seemingly unrelated people. The story
begins in Trinidad, where “Humper”
Heppell is drilling for oil. John Shirley, of
New Orleans, has an interest in the ven-
ture (he owns the land); Roy Bauer, a
temporary millionaire of New York,
tosses some money in; a wealthy Eng-
lishman does likewise, and decides to
sell his London house and buy one in
the country. This brings a gentlemanly
crook into the story (the crook is after
a commission on the sale of the house)
and the crook’s dupe, an upright, bone-
headed old civil servant (retired) with
a craze for the films. And then the
crash, and tragedy for most of them. The
characterisation is admirable (Bergheim,
the Jew broker, who buys and sells
stock for others, but never risks a cent
himself, is a gem), and so is the crafts-
manship with which the various stories
are woven into one another.
The Almost Perfect Murder, by Hul-
bert Footner (Crime Club ; 7s. 6d.), is
the first of four thrillers in which villainy
is exposed by the uncannily astute
Madame Storey. The lady lives in regal
luxury, and her achievements are re-
corded by a lady secretary who combines
the industry of an ant with the humble
subservience of a spaniel. All the yarns
are exciting and well constructed, and
all are oddly permeated with the national
worship of money as such.
Nightmares (Philip Allan; 2s. 6d.) is
another collection of horror-yarns by such
artists as Tod Robbins (represented in
this volume by “The Whimpus”), Hester
Holland Gaskell (“High Tide”) and Philip
Murray (“Hangman’s Cottage”). When
all are capable of making the teeth
chatter it is perhaps invidious to discrim-
inate, but “The Headless Leper,” by
Frederick Cowles, takes some beating as
a study in the macabre.
Ponies and Children, by Audrey
Blewitt (Country Life ; 7s. 6d.), should
have a bigger appeal in Victoria and S.
Aus. than in other Australian States. It
is essentially for youngsters who want
to know what to do, and avoid doing, in
the hunting field. An extremely English
touch is provided by a chapter on
Saddlery and Dress with its sketches of
a little girl in a smart bowler, jacket and
jodhpurs and a deplorable object in a
panama and overcoat. The chapters on
buying, managing and learning to ride
apply to Australia equally with England,
and so, to an extent, does the admirable
chapter on hunting. There are dozens
of clever little illustrations and a fore-
word by one of England’s most eminent
horse-lovers —A. J. Munnings, R.A.
The Whiphand, by Henry B. Raine
(N.S.W. Bookstall Co.; Is. 3d.). About
three Sydneyites who become mates in
Flanders and get back home, where one
of them dies (leaving a charming French
widow), and another wins first prize in
the State lottery and gets mixed up with
Flash Dick’s dope ring. As a result all
kinds of unpleasant things happen to
Jean, daughter of the widow. It goes
with a swing, and there’s a touching cli-
max.

HALVE THE TAXES!
As a nation we may profit by overseas
examples, but not if we follow them
blindly. This we have done, with unfor-
tunate results of which everyone is cog-
nisant ; nevertheless, the tendency to con-
tinue the process is still strong. There
are those among us who would copy
foreign forms of government and
“socialisation,” even to the extent of im-
posing them on us by force. Because
Fascism suits the Italians and Sovietism
suits the Russians (or its supporters say
it does), it is asserted that one or the
other would suit the Australians. The
truth is that Australia is of all countries
the least congenial field for a dictator-
ship; Australians are of all peoples the
least adapted for surrender to iron dis-
cipline. Mussolini is reckoned the most
successful of the dictators ; certainly he
has lasted the longest. In Australia he
would not last a month.
It is now suggested that the Common-
wealth needs a Franklin Roosevelt. That
dictator’s programme may possibly suc-
ceed in Amferica, but it could not be imi-
tated in Australia without disaster. There
is all the difference in the world between
his country’s conditions and ours. We
went to America for certain features of
our Commonwealth Constitution and
have been paying for it ever since.
We have followed British precedents
also—with unhappy consequences when
we followed them regardless of our
peculiar circumstances. In one respect
the British copied us; they went in for “a
vigorous public-works policy” on familiar
Australian lines. The fruits were men-
tioned by the President of the Board of
Trade at the World Economic Confer-
ence in speaking on a proposal that
Britain should help to finance an inter-
national programme of works “to absorb
the unemployed.” “We have in recent
years devoted £100,000,000 to schemes of
this kind,” he sadly said. “For every
£1,000,000 expended we employed 2000
men directly and 2000 indirectly. It is
an experiment we are not going to re-
peat.” vSo the Old Man can learn from
his follies, though our politicians have
yet to show themselves capable of doing
so.
Our politicians have followed British
Governments in imposing sky-high taxes
particularly income tax though
Maoriland’s have not. Britain, with a
landed aristocracy, with industries in
many cases hundreds of years old and
with huge overseas investments, has per-
haps been in a position to stand terrific
taxation, though there are ominous signs
that it has been carried too far. Aus-
tralia possesses none of these advantages.
Our wool growers were thought to be
securely established, if any section of our
producers was. Three years of low
prices plus high interest-rates and merci-
less taxes have reduced many of them to
dire straits. Our wheatgrowers are in
even a sadder plight. Our manufacturers,
shipowners, mineowners, have, with few
exceptions, always had a struggle for
existence. For a time it seemed that the
depression had spared the dairying indus-
try ; now the bottom has fallen out of the
butter market and the cow-farmers are
wondering how they can carry on.
The honesty and good sense of the
Australian people asserted themselves in
a dark hour. The national conscience
revolted against default and inflation,
and the defaulters and inflationists were
swept away. For their ruinous schemes
the so-called Premiers’ plan, which did
not originate with any Premier, was sub-
stituted. Within its limits it has worked
well. Credit has been restored ; the con-
version of six per cents, is proceeding
steadily ; administrative expenditure and
deficits have been substantially reduced.
But the Premiers’ plan, like patriotism, is
not enough. A great many of our people
remain unemployed, and no Government
has any concrete proposal for putting
them back in the occupations with which
they are familiar. The little work that
Governments are providing, chiefly out
of tax-revenue, is useless —worse than
useless where it is unproductive, as
so much of it is. They have tried giving
men the dole, tried making them work for
the dole and a few shillings ; now they
are going to try another “vigorous public-
works policy,” financed by loans.
The Loan Council is to go on the
market for £17,000,000 or £18,000,000,
which will perhaps be expended on things
like the Parramatta pressure tunnel, which
is gone but not forgotten, the Fremantle
graving dock, which slid into the sea,
and the 43-mile Glenreagh-Dorrigo rail-
way, on which £87,600 was lost in a
"good” year. It would be infinitely better
to apply the money to reduction of taxes,
since that would assist hard-pressed in-
dustries to keep going and put them in
the way of re-employing the 95 per cent,
of out-of-works who have to look to
the private wage-payer for jobs, and of
finding places for the sad army of young
people who have been eating their hearts
out in idleness since they left school.
Reduction of taxes means interest-reduc-
tion, as the A.M.P. showed when
it offered to lower the rates it charges
mortgagors, to whom it has lent
£19,000,000, “by such amount as Gov-
ernments may free such income from
taxation”—to 4 per cent, indeed if in-
terest on 4 per cent, mortgages were
made tax-free.
It would be better still to raise enough
tor a 50 per cent, reduction in all the
taxes which are stifling industry and
keeping up the cost of living—which is
rising when it should be falling. No
tampering with Protection, but 50 per
cent, off the revenue duties, customs
and excise; 50 per cent, off the sales
tax ; 50 per cent, off the income taxes.
Federal and State ; 50 per cent, off the
unemployed-relief taxes, which are for
the most part levied on gross income ;
50 per cent, off the land taxes and
the N. S. Wales endowment tax—though
the endowment tax and the Federal land
tax should be abolished altogether: the
Commonwealth, for its part, might sub-
stitute a tax on lottery prizes. Then
award wages would come down without
leaving a bitter taste in the worker’s
mouth, and his unemployed mate would
have a chance of getting a real job.
If borrow we must, let us borrow for
tax- and interest-reduction and not for
“works.”
TWO PACIFIC MANDATES.
A quarter of a century ago represen-
tatives of the German Empire acquired
a new colonial capital at Rabaul and
began in earnest to subdue the native
races of the already-occupied Bismarck
Archipelago and of Kaiser Wilhelm’s
Land on the mainland of New Guinea.
They built wharves, hacked cocoanut
plantations out of the jungle, planted
casuarinas in the streets of their towns,
planned boulevards and laid down a few
miles of good road. They were building
up a force of native police when August
4, 1914, came along. The native police
were blooded. They shot good Austra-
lians from the timber along the Kaba-
kaul-road. Then Haber marched out of
Rabaul and Holmes marched in.
The Union Jack was hauled up. A
proclamation was read to the astonished
heathen which offered them liberty and
ended with “No more um Kaiser; God
savum King.” A warship went to Kaiser
Wilhelmshaven and found a Japanese
fleet in the roads, and post-captains walk-
ing in the streets under the apparent im-
pression that they had taken possession
of the whole Territory. Seven years later,
under a neat compromise, a flurry of
1500 islands north of the Equator be-
came Japanese mandated territory, and
all the German islands south of the
Equator were handed over to Australia.
Since then a lot of water has run
under the bridge. The German planters
were expropriated. Their plantations
were sold —to Australians, for the most
part, though intensive Australian colo-
nisation is not taking place. There are
now stations with nearly 10,000,000
cocoanut-trees, most of them more
than ten years old. Several steam-
ship lines call at Rabaul. Gold discovery
on the mainland at Edie Creek saved the
finances of the steamy country.
The Government, the planters and the
miners have all suffered vicissitudes, but
one work which has gone forward with-
out tribulation has been the civilisation
of the native. Every year new villagers are
brought within the sphere of influence
of the Rabaul Administration and soap.
They are taught to suppress a laudable
natural inclination to heave spears at tax-
collectors. They learn their ABC and
simple carpentry and “Mary had a little
lamb.” Their womenfolk are clothed —
if you can call it that. Above all,
they learn the sacred rights of man, par-
ticularly his right to be paid wages and
to be treated kindly. It also is impressed
on them that while a white planter may
plug another in the eye without conse-
quences, any native who gets plugged for
insolence to the boss may receive prompt
redress.
For the Administration, with an
ever-watchful eye on the tender hearts
of Geneva, lives mainly for the native,
who grows fatter and less disease-
smitten and more arrogant every day.
Mr. Marr, who is called Minister in
Charge of Territories, rejoices in the
fact " that 30,000 recruited laborers
are under civilised control, which
means that every three years or so 30,000
dark persons will return fatter and richer
to their villages to preach the doctrine
of native equality with the whites and
to instruct their brother-savages in the
art of standing on their privileges and
of using the Native Ordinances to the
best advantage. Many a village which a
few years ago considered the spear and
the bow to be the acme of modern arma-
ment has learnt about the rifle. It is a
pretty picture—for old ladies. It is not
so pretty for Australia.
Here are 750,000 people, many of them
tierce and warlike, inhabiting a region
between the edges of Australia and Asia,
being carefully drilled into a sense of
their own importance and of their right
to manage their own affairs, without any
apparent thought being given as to what
their future is to be.
If the intention is that they shall form
a black tributary nation, for ever subser-
vient to this continent, it is unlikely to
be realised. One remembers that a
descendant of those Maoris who in the
1850’s were still eating their enemies had
so far advanced in civilisation in
the 1920’s that, having been knighted
by his Majesty, he was called to order
by an indignant Parliamentary speaker
for referring to the British-born leader
of the M.L. Opposition as “Snivel-
ling Jimmy.” There are a few races —
though not many—around New Guinea
waters capable of reaching the same high
level of culture as the Maoris and of
using the mentally lower-grade peoples
as their helots.
On the other hand, if the Mandated
Territory is to be perpetually used as an
internationally-owned ward of Australia,
from which foreign elements cannot be
for ever excluded by law, what will the
outcome be? The extra-native popula-
tion at the last census was made up as
follows:
British 1992
Non-British .. .. .. 2150
4142
Of the non-British 1219 are Chinese and
Japanese who have survived as perma-
nent residents since before the British
came. The others —370 Germans, 213
Dutch, 144 Americans—have mainly
trickled in or returned to former haunts
since expropriation, in spite of serious
discouragement from the Government.
Chinamen hold 10 per cent, of all native
recruiting licenses. Of the ships which
visited the Territory in 1931, the last year
for which figures are available, 32 were
foreign and 59 British. The proportion
is alarming more in its growth than in
the actual figures, especially when one
knows that if real pressure were brought
on the Government nothing could pre-
vent the influx of further foreign capital
and settlers.
The Japanese procedure in the islands
just north of the Equator —the Marshalls,
Carolines, Pellews and Mariannes —has
been far different. From the moment
Japan received the mandate it treated
these territories as Japanese possessions.
Natives were sent in batches each year
to see the wonders of Japan. Their cul-
ture is developed only so far as it furthers
Japanisation. Thousands of Formosan
Japanese have been taken to the islands
and established there to such good pur-
pose that the annual number of Japanese
births, according to a League report, now
exceeds the number of native births. And
in this newly Orientalised area, part of
which is as near to Brisbane as it is to
Formosa and as near to Sydney as it is
to Nagasaki, there are no foreigners
except 65 missionaries. Neither does any
ship not Japanese call there.
Nobody can blame the Japanese for
thinking of their own national interests
as well as those of the natives. Major
Marr and his gentle fellow-philanthro-
pists, in forming their Rabaul policies,
might well consider Australia more and
the opinions of the Liberian dnd Abys-
sinian delegates to Geneva less.
THE OMNIPOTENT GLAND.
“It is indeed a sobering reflection that ‘ft’
should, after all, be only a matter of a few
drops of chemical solution which even the most
unromantic of us may one day be able to
purchase from the apothecary.” —A medical
contributor to Melbourne “Argus.”
This age of ours is the age of scientism
and the doctors are our high priests.
They know everything. They dissect
dead bodies and vivisect helpless animals,
and thus attain to supreme wisdom. They
discover the key to the mystery of life,
though the pattern of the key often
changes. Last year it was one thing, this
year another, and no doubt next year it
will be something different.
The key at present is the hormones.
It fits the front-door lock of every
human mansion. Glands placed in dif-
ferent parts of the human mechanism
secrete the hormones, and if these glands
are sub- or super-normal all sorts of
extraordinary things happen. If you have
a faulty ductless gland you will develop
an inferiority complex. If your thyroids
are out of order you are in danger of
relapsing into idiocy. If you are a coward
or a hero, don’t blame or praise your-
self —place the responsibility on your
suprarenals.
It has been definitely proved that
glands can turn a promising child into
a fool, a giant, a sloth, a dwarf or a
megalomaniac. Since this is so, what
more logical than to suppose that even
the apparently-normal person is the crea-
tion of his glands, and is self-conscious
or blatantly aggressive according to their
condition?
It makes everything quite simple. Any
general practitioner, armed with a bottle
of thyroid or pituitary extract, with the
necessary instructions on the wrapper,
can turn you into a Pericles, a Napoleon,
a Rodin or a Beethoven, according to re-
quirements. Shelley was a typical hyper-
thyroid. Unfortunately he was born be-
fore the new key was discovered, or a
visit to his medical adviser would have
fixed him up and he wouldn’t have writ-
ten anything so deplorable as “The Witch
of Atlas.”
Unscientific people, mere life obser-
vers, are suspicious of this engaging
theory because it is advanced by scien-
tists. The trouble about scientists is that
so many of them are motor mechanics.
You could state most of their theories
in terms of the automobile. The body is
a machine. It has a carburetter, a
vacuum tank, a distributor, an exhaust
and a petrol tank and batteries. If you
pour water in with the petrol it won’t
go, and if you let the batteries run down
it won’t run either. It is no use reasoning
with it, praying over it, flogging it. You
must recharge the batteries or change the
petrol. This is all too ingenuous.
Here is Bella, just entering on ado-
lescence. Bella is subject to fits of irri-
tability (deficiency of lime in the blood
due to defective functioning of the para-
thyroids). She is timid (her adrenalins
are not secreting sufficiently). She lies,
is disobedient, and has a craving for the
limelight (her pituitary is faulty). She
is healthy and blooming, but she has a
marked inferiority complex.
To her parents, Bella is a distressing
enigma. They helplessly watch her
turning in all directions. She tries to
lead the normal life of a girl of her age,
meeting young men and going to dances.
She grows tired of it. She becomes pas-
sionately interested in horses, and grows
tired of them also. She learns to play
tennis efficiently, but tennis, too, becomes
tedious to her. Then, quite by accident,
she meets a painter, a very good painter,
who is also an extraordinarily good
teacher.
Bella starts to learn painting. At first
she is apathetic. She becomes enthusiastic
and anon discouraged. She is alternately
dominated by her master and eager to
escape from his influence. She does not
know whether to glorify him or belittle
him. But whichever way she struggles he
is always there, relentlessly pointing to
the way she must take if she is to be-
come an artist.
Gradually Bella gains control over her
medium. She paints better and better,
and becomes interested in her own de-
velopment. And with her development
as a painter goes the development of her
character. She acquires poise and selt-
respect, without losing her sensitiveness :
she begins to know what to select and
what to discard in life outside her chosen
medium. She is also beginning to paint
remarkably well. Who would have
thought she had this talent? Artists are
born, not made, aren’t they? So, at
any rate, say the textbooks—with glan-
dular-theory reservations.
And all this bother could have been
avoided and the same results achieved
if Bella had paid a visit to a physician.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
Case of the Christina Fraser.
The collier Christina Fraser, bound from
Bulli to Melbourne, was lost in a squall
off Gabo on the morning of June 24. A
Commonwealth Marine Court, headed by
a Sydney police magistrate, has found
that she was in a good and seaworthy
condition, was properly officered and
manned, was provided with “boats and
other life-saving appliances and signals
of distress, in accordance with the re-
quirements of law,” was not overladen
nor improperly loaded.
The cause of the disappearance the
Court was unable to determine definitely,
the evidence, it seems, being insufficient;
but it expressed “sincere sympathy with
the relatives and friends of the members
of the crew.” On this point the public is
with it. On others there was a conflict
of testimony which may seem strange.
For example, a State Navigation De-
partment officer reported that the Chris-
tina Fraser left Bulli with “about a
quarter of the after-end of No. 2 hatch
open,” and with 727 tons of coal —“over
200 tons more than on any previous
occasion.” But a former skipper of the
vessel was present at the loading ; he
swore that the steamer was “light-
loaded,” that she was “a beautiful little
boat” and “would have gone round the
Horn with any craft” ; and that the
trimming was adequate. Another ex-
captain also certified to her seaworthi-
ness. On the other hand, an A.B. deposed
that he, two other seamen and a fireman
had quitted the ship because she was
“cranky” ; and one of the other seamen
said that in rough weather the decks
were awash.
It might be said that Captain Queen,
his two mates and his crew of 14
could have given weightier evidence
than any of the witnesses actually called.
But they are dead, and their homes are
desolate.
The Christina Fraser belonged to the
owners of the Annie M. Miller, which
went to the bottom in 1929, taking six
men with her. She was without a
wireless outfit. Neither the Christina
Fraser nor the Koranui, which was the
iast to sight her, had wireless, and the
Court boldly ventured the opinion that
II seagoing vessels in the coastal trade
should be fitted with wireless. There are
constitutional difficulties in the way. In
the case of the Newcastle and Hunter
River Co. v. the Commonwealth Attor-
ney-General, the High Court found that
the national Parliament had no legis-
lative power over vessels engaged in the
domestic trade of any one State ; and 90
per cent, of boats not equipped with wire-
less are trading exclusively within one
State. Under existing law any vessel
under 1600 tons gross register need not
carry wireless ;■ vessels of anv tonnage,
however large, if trading intra-State, need
not carry it.
In 1919 the N. S. Wales Government
appointed a royal commission to report
on the loading of steam colliers. This
commission found that coal was likely
to shift its position in the hold during a
voyage, even in ordinary weather. It re-
commended that cargoes should be
trimmed so as to prevent this shifting.
Yet it is common talk on the waterfront
that colliers are allowed to leave port
with the coal’s ordinary angle of repose
trimmed only to an extent sufficient to
enable the hatches to be put on.
It seems extraordinary that police
magistrates should be taken from drunk-
and-disorderly cases to conduct inquiries
so important to all persons who go
down to the sea in ships. It is surely
a job for a Judge like Halse Rogers.
O
The Peace Wave in Melbourne.
Melbourne is suffering from an out-
break of pacifism. The other evening
there were 18 anti-war meetings in 18
different suburbs. One was held in Col-
lingwood, home of the gang warriors;
the chief speaker was Tunnecliffe, the
politically warlike leader of the Opposi-
tion in the Leg. Assembly. Among other
things Mr. Tunnecliffe said that only
when we believe the Chinese, the Jap-
anese and other races are as good as
we are shall we be on the highway to-
wards universal peace. (Loud cheers.)
In some districts Chinese mothers con-
sider it good to take female offspring
and expose them on stone slabs outside
the city gates. Mr. Tunnecliffe would
not consider this good. Chinese husbands
consider it good to have a wife and three
concubines simultaneously. This also
would not be reckoned good by Mr.
Tunnecliffe. When Japanese politicians
have lost the confidence of their coun-
try they go away and commit hara-kiri.
This would not be regarded as good by
Mr. Tunnecliffe either. As an Australian
Mr. Tunnecliffe doesn’t esteem all races
as good as we are or he would not
acquiesce in the Australian occupation
of Papua and New Guinea. As a citizen
of the Empire, he acquiesces in British
control of Hindus, Malays, negroes,
Arabs and South American Indians, pre-
sumably because they are not considered
as good as we are. Indeed, Mr. Tunne-
cliffe’s idea of what is good is subject to
all sorts of qualifications.
There are some things at which the
Chinese and Japanese are as good as we
are, if not better. They are good at mak-
ing cheap articles at low wages, whereby
they undersell Australian manufacturers
and cause unemployment in Mr. Tunne-
cliffe’s trade-unions. The Japanese are so
good at this that, without moving a single
battleship or a solitary regiment, they
are driving our goods out of Java,
Malaya and other places. This is a form
of economic warfare, and it is a fixed
dogma with Labor politicians that trade
wars lead to military wars. Mr. Tunne-
cliffe believes in the development of Aus-
tralian industry. He also believes in
higher wages and shorter hours for Aus-
tralian workers. Under existing condi-
tions Australian industry cannot develop
unless it sells some of its goods abroad
and is sheltered behind tariff walls at
home. Countries are only allowed to
have tariff' walls if they can defend them,
in the last resort, with adequate navies,
armies and aeroplanes. The same is true
of immigration-restriction policies.
Mr. Tunnecliffe did not enlighten the
meeting on any of these questions. The
trouble is that he is just another of those
windy optimists who believe the spirit
of internationalism and brotherhood can
be fostered by making speeches.
The Friendly Caterpillar.
The report of the Commonwealth Prickly
Pear Board which met in Brisbane last
week shows how unwise it is to kill a
caterpillar until you know whether or
not he is a friend. Cactoblastis cdctorum,
for instance, is not prepossessing, and his
name is distinctly against him ; but he
shares with those scaly persons the
cochineal insect and the chelinidea a
voracious appetite which is all to man’s
good. The three friends in the last two
years have eaten 8,452,421 acres of
prickly pear in Forgan Smith’s State.
Much of this enormous dinner was old-
man pear, so thickly huddled together
that rabbits and dogs got caught in it,
so all-permeating that its spikes were
found in luxurious quantities in the local
water supply, blankets, chair cushions
and even more painful places. It drove
all settlement before it in spite of
pear-rollers, hoes, ploughs, arsenious
trichloride and poison gas—the Roberts
gas, on the manufacture of which Ger-
man chemists were employed in 1914, is
supposed to have been the father of Ger-
many’s first essays in gas warfare. It
was little use in pear warfare.
The land which the insects have
cleared, and which is worth, perhaps,
from £1 to £2 per acre on an average
according to locality, has now mostly
been reselected, and the Pear Board is
busy cultivating even more voracious
appetites to absorb the remaining fairly
large acreages of cacti which have proved
indigestible to the existing types of in-
sect. A new strain of cochineal imp,
very aptly named the Dactylopsius con-
fusus, is being bred to deal with tiger
pear ; and if still another brand of mite
proves successful the North’s old friend
Opuntia tomentosa is doomed. The only
fear which may be felt is for the future ;
for it may well be asked, parodying the
song:—
What will the cactoblastis eat
When he’s finished his prickly-pear?
This is a matter to which prickly-pear
boards will have to apply their minds.
If he turned to lucerne and other vege-
tables it might, be necessary to introduce
something that would eat him.

Where the Big Estates Grow.
There are remarks of so tame and
habitual a sort that they recite them-
selves. “Big estates” is one of them.
The complete formula of the political
ass is “The lands of Australia must be
made available, and this can only be
done by breaking up the big estates.”
In point of fact, out of every 10,000
acres of Commonwealth surface 4122
acres belong to the Government, and are
unused except for the rearing of dogs,
rabbits, thistles and sundries. This isn’t
all bad land, for the worst pessimist
doesn’t rate the desert area so high as
that. Another 4990 acres belong to
Government, but are leased to sheep-
raisers and others. These men have done
something for Australia. They pay
rents and high railway freight-rates.
They have made our jumbuck one of
the prize animals of the earth ; also, their
wool has been known to realise
£66,000,000 for one year.
As 9112 acres out of every 10,000 are
public property, that leaves 888 acres out
of 10,000 for private property—sB6
acres absolutely private and 302 acres
in process of becoming so, mostly
on the selection system. Details for
Northern Territory are scarce, but by
calling all the N.T. freehold big estate,
and so making things look worse than
they are, these results are arrived at:
Australia as a Whole.
Acres.
Big estates (50,000 acres and over) 7,543,500
Medium estates (20,000 to 50,000
acres) .. 9,212,000
Public land let out on lease or
license .. .. .. •• 948,917,300
Public land lying idle, save that it
is used by dogs and sundries and
a fragment of it grows trees .. 769,066,400
The moral which the figures convey is
that Australia is much more in need of
statesmen who will do some intelligent
work with the big Government areas, or
farm them out to people who will, than
of dull tripe merchants who talk about
breaking up private properties. Success-
ful settlement of new lands is a difficult
matter, for it calls for the opening of
new ports and the building of railways
into places where there are few votes.
Denunciation of large landowners is
within the mental compass of anyone.
The Commonwealth has 200,000,000,
unused acres of its own, in addition to
130,000,000 acres which will become
available as existing leases expire. The
need for breaking up estates like that
seems plain.
.4
Tree-felling and Loss.
Australia should take warning from
older countries and do something at
once about the obliteration of timber.
If Governments could see lands like
Persia, Asia Minor and Iraq and
deduce the obvious facts from them, the
present policy of wiping off every get-at-
able tree would cease and they would be-
gin to plan ahead so that the only tim-
ber destroyed would be that which it is
essential to destroy for cropping and pas-
turage purposes.
The countries mentioned are eaten out
to the last stick except on inaccessible
mountainsides. You can travel hundreds
of miles in them without finding enough
wood to boil a quartpot. Everywhere
are landslides, water-worn gullies, crumb-
ling creek-banks and blinding spaces and
sand patches which have been bleached
and battered by the sun’s rays, so that
nothing but saltbush can live on them,
except under an intensive system of irri-
gation.
Already in Australia we are beginning
to see the effects of denudation. On the
south coast of N. S. Wales hillsides are
tumbling into the rivers. In Victoria
recently officials reported on the “dire
effects” of ringbarking timber on the
creek- and river-banks of the Murray
watershed, despite the provisions in the
original Land Act which reserved timber
rights for a chain width along the banks
of streams —provisions which it seems to
have been nobody’s business to enforce.
As a result, the greatest river in the con-
tinent is silting up. Almost every other
big stream is suffering the same fate.
No observer can fail to notice the
change which has taken place in a lot of
N.S.W. western lands, in particular, after
ringbarking and a few years of stocking.
Trees, even forest trees, provide the best of
fertiliser and humus, and to rob the land
of this is to swiftly change its immemorial
natural characteristics, apart from caus-
ing over-evaporation and depriving the
soil of the full benefit of the rainfall.
Every creek and river on a Government
lease should be planted with suitable
timber —the willow is the easiest thing in
the world to grow and gives good shade
for stock as well as providing a good
drought-time fodder—and no property
should be without its windbreaks, no hill-
side without its quota of live and hold-
ing roots.
Instead of growing millions of trees to
be supplied free to civil-servant residents
of the suburbs of Canberra, a few tens
of millions might be grown to help rural
owners and occupiers in Australia at
large to save the large junks of their con-
tinent which are slipping over the edge
or parching and starving into unproduc-
tive sand.
-
Robbery as a Fine Art.
The N. S. Wales Taxation Department,
which issues Federal as well as State
assessments, though not all of them,
publishes on two closely-printed sheets
the size of an ordinary newspaper what
it calls “Directions to Assist Taxpayers
in the Preparation” of their “Returns.”
The “directions” are largely warnings.
If a taxpayer “fails to furnish any
information required by the form” or
“to furnish a return by the due date,”
he is “liable to pay an amount not
exceeding £lOO, and an additional tax of
10 per cent, on the amount of both
Federal and State taxes,” “For making a
return false in any particular” the pen-
alty may be £100; “for knowingly and
wilfully making a false statement” in a
return you may be hit up for “an amount
not exceeding £5OO, plus three times the
tax that would have been avoided if the
false return had been accepted as cor-
rect.” And the fine for being late with
the form and other penalties may be
imposed by some jack-in-office at his
own sweet will.
Plain ordinary blokes are expected
in these matters to measure up to the
highest moral standard. They are not
to keep the Government waiting or cheat
it, although the Government may keep
them waiting and cheat them.
The N. S. Wales taxpayer is com-
manded in item 2 of the return to state
his gross income from personal exertion,
“including unemployment-relief tax.”
This is 5 per cent., and the person on
salary or wages never handles it. The
Commonwealth allows the 5 per cent,
as a deduction from taxable income, but
the State taxes him on it —plunders him,
rather. It plunders him even more out-
rageously if he draws income from other
States. He is bidden to note that “in
addition to income liable to N. S. Wales
State income tax, income derived by a
resident from sources outside the State”
—that is, “sources in any country or any
State, whether inside or outside Aus-
tralia”—is subject to this unemployed-
relief tax of Is. in the £. It is also, of
course, subject to State and Federal in-
come tax and State unemployed-relief
tax in the part of Australia whence it is
derived. And, in some cases at least,
probably in many, these three taxes actu-
ally amount to less than the N. S. Wales
impost, for which there is not a shred
of moral justification.
The Bulletin has been shown the
assessment papers of a Sydney man who
in 1931-32 drew £l4O in property in-
come from Victoria. His Vic. income
tax and unemployed-relief tax came to
£2 ss. Id. altogether. The N. S. Wales
unemployed-relief tax demanded was
£7 14s. When the Vic. unemployed-relief
lax arrived it was levied on 1929-30 in-
come, so as to get money in immediately.
The commencing year was altered by
statute to 1930-31 and a great many re-
funds of overpaid tax have been made.
These refunds have to be included as
income for the financial year in which
they are received, not only in Victoria
but in N. S. Wales. Thus N. S. Wales
residents who have received them from
the Victorian department are expected to
pay Is. in the £ on them to the Sydney
bloodsuckers. And if they are late with
the money thus extorted from them, an-
other 10 per cent, is demanded by way
of fine. In some instances the fine is
greater than the actual amount of relief
tax in the State of origin.
“He who seeks equity should do
equity.” Evidently the Government which
practises this extortion and its instru-
ments consider that the old legal maxim
applies only to taxpayers and not to
them.
One Big Bank.
Dear Bulletin, —I am manager of a
fair-sized country branch of one of the
trading banks. After a trying day in the
office, I picked up my evening paper and
read: “The Commonwealth .Bank should
extend its power and influence until,
eventually, it becomes the only trading
bank.” Little Mr. Scullin, of course.
I can imagine the sort of treatment
most people would receive if there were
only one bank. Presumably the applica-
cant for an overdraft would fill in a
printed form, and receive an answer-
after weeks of waiting. It would be
beyond the capacity of the one manager
to see every customer, as people expect
us to do under “capitalism.” To-day, for
instance, I spent two hours with the
executors of a particularly involved
estate. Then a garage man called to ask
whether he could have £5O for three
days to meet his petrol account. Then in
came Mrs. Thomson, who has a few
pounds to invest, and wants to know all
about fixed deposits and bonds. Then
a man to have his will witnessed and to
leave it for safe custody. If anyone is
dissatisfied he can take his business else-
where. He couldn’t if there were only
one bank.
The four banks in our town are housed
in four buildings, with managers’ resi-
dences. They employ domestics and 24
clerks, and pay substantial rates. With
only one bank in the place most of the
clerks and the domestics would go —is
that what the Labor party is for? —and
there would be a great slump in rates
and taxes. The chairman of . one of the
banks, by no means the largest, recently
said that his institution was paying over
£lOOO a day in taxation. The profits of
a Labor-controlled bank monopoly might
make up for the loss in tax-revenue, but
it is at least doubtful. —Yours etc.,
Moneybags.

“El V.”: Dr. Astel, opening the first
Nazi Institute of Racial Hygiene, re-
marked the other day that “affianced
people should investigate each other’s
family tree —if, possible as far as the

prove that the stock is entirely Aryan.”
But this would prove nothing. Behind
the 16 g-g-g.’s are 32 greater-g.’s and
behind those a generation of 64 and so
on. By the time we reach the 30th gen-
eration —that is, the day of William the
Conqueror —we should have, if each layer
of ancestors had been distinct, a solid
backing of 526,846,912 progenitors be-
hind us, probably more people than
the world contained in the eleventh
century. Recently, investigating the pedi-
gree of the most prolific line of famous
Shorthorn cattle in Australia, which
should have expanded back to 128,872
animals in 17 generations, 1 found that
their 17th-generation ancestry actually
condensed into a'half-brother and -sister,
son and daughter of a single bull. It
would be a shocking blow to Hitlerism
if somebody, exploring the fastnesses of
the Hitler family past, were to find his
ultimate origin concentrated in, say,
Abraham and Sarah.

“Koplik”: “Pawang” (B. 26/7/’33)
suggests that the narrow hips so notice-
able with the present fashions will make
child-bearing difficult. Actually, this is
seldom the case, the narrowness being
more apparent than real. The breadth
of the adult female pelvis remains re-
markably constant at 11 inches, a varia-
tion of more than half an inch either
way being quite unusual. Breadth in the
beam mostly means nothing more than
some extra fat over the bony framework,
and this is no help when having children.

“Sark”: Garibaldi seems to have been
the first natural leader to hit on the idea
of using a colored shirt as an emblem
of patriotism and a uniform for his fol-
lowers. Red was his color, and to this
day the red shirt retains a revolutionary
flavor. It seems odd that 60 years should
have elapsed before the idea reappeared,
again in Italy, with Mussolini’s black-
shirted Fascists. Now Hitler and his
Nazis have made brown their color, and
there is a blue-shirted army of sorts in
the Irish Free State, unscrupulous Sas-
senachs having pinched the national color
for a green-shirted organisation in Eng-
land. Chinamen are supposed to have
established something of a lien on yellow
shirts, so that there aren’t many colors
left for movements of the New Guard
type unless something on Pied Piper lines
should be favored.
“Kay”: Who says Australian film
producers haven’t the right ideas? The
production schedule of one of the biggest
cos. calls for the early filming of “Robbery

Not Hang,” “The Kelly Gang” and
“The Fatal Wedding.” Critics who de-
nounce the flood of Yankee gangster
films will be perturbed if this is the
best we can offer by way of local pro-
duct.

ing that if an employee were called upon
to serve as a juror it was intended to
dismiss him because it would interfere
with his office duties. His Honor hav-
ing handed this compound of insult and
threat to the Crown Prosecutor, some
conception of the enormity of his offence
appears to have dawned upon the letter
writer, who hastened to express, through
counsel, his sincere regret, “the docu-
ment having been written in a moment
of temporary irritation.” The offender
was luckv in having his apology
accepted. There are some Judges who

T. THE R.


“X.S.”: Cabled from Dublin that Prof.
Moorland, the new president of the
8.M.A., who is blind, delivered an
address on quacks of 10,000 words from
memory with perfect fidelity to the text,
which was in the hands of members. As
great a feat was performed by a member
of the Victorian detective force at an
inquest in Melbourne a few years ago.
He related from memory all his comings
and goings, conversations with scores of
people and the relevant times in a com-
plicated case of murder without once
repeating himself, or even hesitating. The
address lasted an hour and ten minutes
and, if the rate of verbal flow is estimated
at 150 words a minute, there were 10,500
words in it.

“Spring Suitings”: 1 sympathise with
Sir Walter Gilbey, who, I see, has been
campaigning once more against the
clothes worn by riders in Rotten Row.
I wish he would visit Sydney and level
a few spirited insults at the members of
local riding clubs, male and female, who
wear a kind of cowboy’s outfit from the
waist downwards and, for the rest, get
themselves up like guests at a garden
party. While he was about it he might
get to work on our football teams. The
carnival at the Cricket Ground dotted the
city streets with little groups of lads in
any old trousers and hats and garish
blazers. Why blazers? They have no
more to do with football than solar
topees, and in any case they look as much
out of place in a city street as pyjamas.
“My nanny chooses my pwetty clothes."
“Mine choosed me a pwetty muvver.”
Some were even to be seen at theatres
and movies. Visitors to Australia guf-
faw when they recall the complimentary
things Masefield and other war-time
writers said about the Australians’ phy-
sique. Yet Masefield was right. During
the war our lads were dressed; ever
since they have dressed themselves, and
in nine cases out of ten they tend to
mess the job up. It isn’t due to a manly
lack of vanity ; on the contrary. I have
seen brawny toilers with all kinds of gew-
gaws hanging from their watch-chains,
and enough crude colors in their shirts,
ties, collars, socks and even shoes to give
one eye-strain. Like over-decorated build-
ings they fail to show their true propor-
tions.

“Vicar”: A young man charged with
vagrancy at Perth nearly got away with
it when he told the magistrate he had
been working on a farm in the country.
“What part of the country?” asked the
beak. “At Pardellup,” said the no-visible-
means suspect. The P.M. looked puzzled,
until the prosecuting sergeant threw his
beaming countenance on the situation:
“Your Worship; Pardellup is our prison
farm.”

“Strict Veg.”: The matron of a home
in Melbourne which, among other things,
specialises in the treatment of inebriates
received an unsolicited testimonial re-
cently. One of her patients was released,
cured, after six months’ residence and
immediately went to the city, where
he went on a burst again. At about mid-
night his heart suddenly overflowed with
gratitude for his benefactor, and he
staggered into a taxi and ordered the
driver to proceed to the hospital. At
about 1 a.m. the matron was awakened
by a prolonged ringing of her doorbell.
A few minutes later a nurse was tuck-
ing him in in the cot he had vacated a
few hours earlier.
* # J*:
“lan C.”: Several men were charged at
a Vic. suburban court the other day with
having in their possession firewood sus-
pected of being unlawfully obtained. The
prosecution alleged that the offenders had
made a levy on barrows of wood served
out to fellow-unemployed on sustenance,
and although it was pleaded that the
rightful owners had acquiesced, the Court
made it £5 or a month. “Unlawful pos-
session” is an elastic charge in Vic. Some
ten years ago, when the police strike
occurred and big city shops were looted,
some incautious onlookers picked up hats
or shirts from the roadway, and only
realised their mistake when they were
sentenced to fine or imprisonment. One
of the culprits was a Government em-
ployee who afterwards entered public
life.

“10-2-4”: If I were chosen, like an-
other Paris, to award an apple for vanity,
I don’t think I would hand it to a beauti-
ful movie star, male or female, or even
to a Continental Dictator. The Three
Graces would be inevitably Shaw,
Gandhi and Einstein. I would be dis-
posed to order Shaw out of the judging-
ring at an early stage, though in any
but world’s championship class he
would, of course, be unbeatable. He isn’t
fatuous enough. One gets an impression
at times that he is laughing at himself.
I have suspected his bona fides ever
since he burlesqued his first novel in
“The Admirable Bashville.” Gandhi and
Einstein, however—l am going on their
utterances to pressmen, and their appear-
ances on movie screens —are almost
flawless examples of ineffable conceit.
Both have that clownish quality which
is to be observed in all egomaniacal old-
sters. Einstein simpers, Gandhi grins;
Einstein scores with masses of hair,
Gandhi prides himself on a head like a
black egg; Einstein’s posture is to get
himself up in clothes of conspicuous
shabbiness, Gandhi’s to recline before
the camera in brazen , and revolting
nakedness. But consider Gandhi’s gums.
And the superior number and quality
of his publicity stunts. Yes; I think
the verdict can be arrived at without
further debate. Out of the ring, Profes-
sor! Forward, Mahatma, and tuck this
in your loincloth!
“Vicar”: Discipline has been tightened
up in Government departments where
comings and goings of the staff (so long
as it had a file under its arm) formerly
evoked no particular notice. A West-
ralian Agricultural Bank man was trans-
ferred from a branch to headquarters. He
seemed fitting into his new sphere well
enough, except that about 11 o’clock every
morning he used to take ten minutes off
for a stroll across the road. Somebody
mentioned the offence in a good-nattired
way to one of the heads ; “bad example for
the rest of the staff, sir.” “Leave it to
me. Bloggs,” said the head. Next day
“A stomach like that and you don't drink! Why, you don’t deserve it!"
the casual drinker found a note on his
table: “Memo. Mr. Erlistoun Korrelock-
ing,—Before leaving in the mornings in
future, please ask me, J. Nibkins.” At
11 next morning Mr. Korrelocking went
to Mr. J. Nibkins’s office. “Are you
ready?” he said from the doorway.
“Ready! Ready!” said Nibkins, look-
ing up from his papers surprisedly;
“ready for what?” “You told me in that
note,” said Korrelocking, as he half-
turned and jerked an indicative finger,
“to ask you when I went to the pub—
well, I’m askin’ you. Are you ready?”
Nibkins wasn’t.

“Nunnykirk”: The claret-drinking pro-
clivities of the Scottish lairds (B.
21/6/’33) continued long enough into
the days of Queen Victoria to go
side by side with other amenities con-
sidered quite modern. Writer can recall
an old gentleman who was an actor in
a story of this period. With a crony he
was at the claret after dinner. The crony
went suddenly on all fours, groping under
the table. Said the sitting man testily,
“What th’ deil are ye daein’ doon there,
Allan, man?” The other replied, “Ah’ve
drappit ma fa’se teeth.” “Let them be,”
quoth his friend, reaching for the de-
canter. “Let them be till th’ morrn ;
ye’ll no’ be wantin’ teeth tae drink clar’t.”
* # * *
“Pieces of Eight” : The Deputy-Master
of the British Mint has announced that
no more gold coins are
to be issued, which is
a pity, for there was a
feeling of affluence
about the possession of
a “golden goblin” which
no piece of crumpled
paper can ever convey.
Still, the magic coin is
likely to linger among
us for many a long
year. Most people have
a vague idea that the
blood - smeared doub-
loon with its historv
reeking of all the seven
deadly sins became no-
thing but an empty name centuries since.
Not so ; the British Government had to
officially abolish its circulation in the
West Indies as recently as 1908.
* * * *
“X.S.”: Physiology is almost as much
a mystery to the average copper as psy-
chology. A Melbourne motorist had
occasion to attend at a suburban police
station and saw a skull lying on the ser-
geant’s desk. “Some boys unearthed it
in a paddock,” explained the sergeant.
“There’s no doubt how the man met
his end,” said the amateur anatomist,
pointing to some gashes. “Well, I’m
blowed,” said the sergeant. “So it’s
human, is it? The constable reckoned
it was some animal, and we’ve been argu-
ing for three days about it.”
“Lao-dah”; This is the age of the
theatrical spotlight. Recently two child-
ren were lost for three days in the
Gippsland bush and the Melbourne
dailies made a terrific song-and-dance
about it. The sobstuff forwarded by a
special writer to one of them was a
masterpiece of sentimentality. The next
move was a request to the mother to
allow her offspring to be shown off to a
sensation-loving public at a community
singsong at Melbourne Auditorium. She
agreed, and the only creditable feature
of the incident is that she did so with
reluctance.
“Kariah”: What is said to be the
first death of its kind is reported from
Bellingen (N.S.W.). A child from
one of the adjacent villages succumbed
to duboisine poisoning after eating the
leaves of what is known as the corkwood-
tree. Duboisine is a rare narcotic, and its
presence in the corkwood-tree ( Duboisia
myoporoides ) has probably been the real
cause of deaths among stock attributed
to other agencies.
* * * *
“Freshford”: Havelock Ellis has been
cited as one of the men whom England
owes in some measure to Australia, by
virtue of a term of residence here. A
Bulletin paragraph of 42 years ago
mentions that Ellis, 14 years be-
fore that, was a tutor at Burwood,
Bathurst and other places in N. S. Wales.
But the books of reference have him
down as merely “engaged in schoolteach-
ing in N.S.W. from 1875 to 1879,”
when he was in his ’teens. It was
not until after his return to England at
20 that Ellis took up medicine and quali-
fied as a doctor as a prelude to his scien-
tific work. There must be Australians
still living who received elementary in-
struction in the ’seventies from the man
who was destined to become world-
famous, but one doesn't hear much of
them. I wonder if they have all for-
gotten the boyish dominie.
sj: :j:
“Karaway”: Randwick Council has
decided to change the name of Long Bay
(Sydney) to Malabar, in deference to
the wishes of the residents who live out-
side the gaol. Two previous cases of this
sort were Rookwood and Callan Park,
the suburban names being altered at
the request of the living and the sane re-
spectively. Malabar commemorates the
vessel that was wrecked off the entrance
to the bay in 1931, and follows the ex-
ample of Collaroy, which was the name
of a vessel wrecked off the coast there
many years ago.
❖ * * :Jj
“F.S.”: Melbourne, which has Dickens,
Thackeray, Shakspeare, Burns, Henry
George and Tailwaggers’ 1 fellowships,
now rejoices in a George Bernard Shaw
Society. In a letter of greeting to his
admirers, Pshaw’s secretary remarked that
his employer was glad of an excuse for
any sort of intellectual co-operation with
Australia, as this country suffers from
intellectual starvation, although it is one
of the few places where people have time
to think. This is a typical specimen of
Shavian dialectics. Australians have no
more tifne to think than any other
people, and, anyhow, people don’t think
better because they are idle. If they
did, the depression would have produced
a great intellectual renaissance through-
out the world, whereas there seems to
be more muddled thinking at present
than at any other period in history.
COLORS.
[For The BULLETIN.]
“Among the fashionable colors for the new modes
are canary yellow, to go with violet, and chartreuse
green, to be worn with plum.”
A natty color scheme knocks a fellow
Whene’er on a feminine frame ’tis set,
And there’s nought like a splash of canary
yellow
To brighten a dame in violet.
In these shades diverse you will find her
crummy.
A vision radiant as e’er was seen;
And if plum becomes her she’ll be more plummy
With a slight infusion of chartreuse green.
Boiled mutton always has clicked with capers;
Spuds go with onions and lamb with mint;
But ever and aye in the fashion papers
You’ll find new matings of hue and tint.
So violet and plum will this year be chary
Offsiders any to pick and choose,
Except the yellow they call canary
And the shade of green that is dubbed
chartreuse.
Some colors whisper while others bellow,;
One visions violet as shrinking-shy,
But there’s nought retiring in clamant yellow,
Which seems to whoop as it hits the eye.
And plum is sober and staid and steady,
So it finds a fitting foil, they ween,
In something giddy and frisky and heady—
There’s a dash of devil in chartreuse green!
A Christmas duff needs a sprig of holly;
When you’re served with fishes you look for
loaves;
There’s an old alliance ’twixt whisky and polly,
And an ancient bond between gin and cloves.
But violet and plum their partners vary,
And they’ll run this season, by twos and twos,
With the kind of yellow that’s ticked canary
And the sort of green that they tab chartreuse.

POLITICAL POINTS
Weaver, the N.S.W. Minister, has gone
to Holy Writ for a defence of his lot-
teries: “And Aaron shall cast lots upon
the two goats.” But surely the associa-
tion of lotteries and goats was obvious
enough without any Scriptural reminder.
The Nazis have substituted the axe for
the rope in dealing with condemned
enemies who don’t obligingly commit
suicide. Groener, who may be destined
to depose Hitler, explains that “the axe
has never given rise to objections” ; but
that is only one side of the case, the
headsman’s. The beheaded have not
testified.
Pearce has decided to protect vital
points of the Australian coast like Syd-
ney, Newcastle and Fremantle with 9.2-
inch coast-defence guns, other key centres
like Townsville being left to look after
themselves. American and British coast
defences have 16-inch guns to meet the
competition of big naval guns which
run up to that calibre; but apparently
it is thought that enemies who may tackle
us will leave weapons which can out-
range or outpound a modest 9.2 at home,
out of regard for Pearce.
The annual report of the Queensland
Public Service Union contains powerful
arguments for separate representation of
Government employees. It complacently
refers to the union’s part in putting an end
to a Government (Moore’s) “that had for
three years waged war on industrialism
and pursued a policy of wage-reduction. 1
The Labor Premier is praised for restor-
ing pay and privileges, but it is broadly
hinted that his janizaries are watching
him, and are capable of doing to Pre-
mier Foggy what they did to Moore.
With the lifting of the British embargo
on public borrowing, Canada has re-
turned to the London loan market, after
25 years, to raise £15,000,000 sterling at
4 p.c. and par, redeemable between 1953
and 1958. It was oversubscribed in a
jiffy. Canada’s net debt is considerably
less than that of the Commonwealth- -it
stood at 1,996,638,000 dollars at the end
of 1931.
It is proposed to grab the old Carlton
Cricket Ground as a site for a college to
house women students at Melbourne
Uni., which has 140 acres already. Mel-
bourne, like most Australian capitals, is
ill-supplied with playgrounds, and the plan
should be scotched. In the time of a
stupid Labor Government, a large slice
of Sydney’s Moore Park was seized for a
girls’ high school, though hundreds of
equally suitable sites were available. The
only excuse for this act of piracy was
that the Moore Park land had not been
dedicated for a playground. The Carl-
ton Cricket Ground was.
Premier McPhee told a deputation that
the paper-pulp business, which will mean
a great deal to the Speck, is going ahead.
Samples of hardwood have been sent to
Scandinavia so that the best machines for
the work may be decided upon. That
settled, a plant will be laid down in Tas.
and about £2,000,000 of capital will be-
come involved in the industry. McPhee
has given an assurance that pulp leases
will not be granted without ample pro-
vision being made for the land-settlement
and timber requirements of the districts
involved.
In July and August Australians have to
grapple with the task of making out
returns for the seven departments which
assess and collect income and unem-
ployed-relief taxes. One Commonwealth
department could do the job with a vast
saving of time and money, and it is
quite 10 years since this administrative
reform was recommended by one of the
multitude of royal commissions ; but it
seems as far off as ever. Nor do the
politicians and the bureaucrats stop at
compelling people to spend hours, days,
in some cases weeks, in filling in un-
necessary forms. Taxpayers who receive
income from more than one State are
robbed right and left, and have no re-
dress.
The bill to limit the Vic. Electricity
Commission’s power of trading in appa-
ratus is having a stormy passage through
Parliament, Labor members raising
the stereotyped arguments in favor of
State trading. The Trades Hall has a
tender interest in State monopolies,
especially when they are exclusively
manned by unionists. What the com-
mission thinks of its Labor friends is
shown by the duplication of supply by
hydro-electric works in almost inaccess-
ible mountains to prevent State and met-
ropolis being plunged in darkness and
idleness by strike holdups.
CHAIRMAN: “We’re going to have a speech from the candidate, follered by
popular items; and I ask you speshully not to rush the latter, as there’s
only one cask.”
Of the 6,619,000 people enumerated
at the census, 203,000 are permanent em-
ployees of States and Commonwealth.
There is also a multitude of temporary
and part-time officials such, as registrars
of births and deaths and postal contrac-
tors ; there are naval, military and air-
force men ; and several thousand persons
are engaged in certain State enterprises.
When municipal employees and families
are added, it is safe to say that the num-
ber of Australians depending on Govern-
ment and institutions subsidised by
Government is equal to the population
of Queensland—942,ooo.
About 200 N. S. Wales municipalities
have adopted the State Government’s
emergency relief scheme, and Sydney daily
papers publish laudations of it by a num-
ber of bumbles as justification for the
maintenance of the shivering thing for
another year. One of these municipal
enthusiasts says it “is a grand scheme.”
It may be from an aldermanic point of
view, since it allows every local panjan-
drum to make two yards of cement gut-
tering grow where one grew before, but
it’s not so grand for the men. They
would prefer real jobs.
One big trade-union is the aim of the
Queensland civil servants —or, at least, of
the delegates to their biennial conference
at Brisbane. It is to embrace all save the
railwaymen, the teachers and the police ;
some delegates tried hard to have these
included, but their amendment was lost.
Three Commissioners, instead of one, are
also demanded, the supply of soft jobs
being insufficient; and if the conference
has its way civil servants contesting Fed-
eral or State elections are not to be
obliged to resign unless they are success-
ful. If a too-confident person resigns and
is defeated, he is to be reinstated im-
mediately. The dutiful Labor Govern-
ment has been ordered to alter the exist-
ing laws and regulations accordingly.
The election of the Labor M.L.A. tor
Kimberley (W.A.) was upset on the score
of technicalities, for which Coverley was
not personally to blame. At the by-elec-
tion his majority was increased from 32
to 289 ; there are only 1000 electors or
so. Some of those who supported the
C.P. man in April turned against him be-
cause they objected to the appeal as un-
sportsmanlike ; but the affair would
have been closer had not a lot of Govern-
ment meatworks employees come up
from Perth in the meantime. They
live at Wyndham for part of the
year only, and an accommodating elec-
toral law admits of their being enrolled
for Kimberley.
Government extravagance is being
assailed from all sides in Victoria. The
Taxpayers’ Association points out that
while, during the depression, the value
of Australian production fell nearly
£200,000,000—t0 £4so,ooo,ooo—Govern-
ments one way and another take
£190,000,000 from the nation. In Vic-
toria alone, as it says, there are five
separate Government purchasing depart-
ments, three official valuers for every
piece of land—Commonwealth, State and
municipal—and three inspectors overlap-
ping the work of meat inspection.
Melbourne unemployed drew attention
to their lot by parading the shopping
streets on a Friday evening and confusing
shoppers. As a result, the Argyles de-
cided to increase the amount of work-
for-sustenance to the married. Another
grievance that merits the attention of
Minister Kent Hughes is the plight of the
married men with maintenance orders
against them. The law makes no dis-
tinction in this connection between the
employed and the jobless, and unem-
ployed defaulters go to gaol.
When Westralia’s Mitchell Govern-
ment nominated Colonel Collett to suc-
ceed Colebatch in the Senate it was
thought that its choice would not be ques-
tioned by the State Parliament. But the
general election gave State Labor such a
majority that the fires of ambition were
kindled in Laborite breasts and the
Collier Government was forced by the
A.L.P. executive into putting up a can-
didate. Though a full muster of Nat.
and C.P. M’s.L.C. could not be obtained,
Collett won. It was a secret ballot,
and a gloomy suspicion lingers at the
Trades Hall that the 28th Battalion’s old
commander got one or two Labor votes.
The Argyles got Vic. Assembly’s sanc-
tion for the appointment of a full-
time vice-chancellor as administrative
head of Melbourne Uni. at £2OOO
p.a,, but there were the usual Labor
objections to “class” legislation. Hogan
remarked that he had reduced his own
screw as Premier by 23 p.c., although
he was underpaid at the time. There is
no particular analogy between the salaries
of politicians who struggle amongst
themselves for admission to the Parlia-
mentary tartshop and the emoluments of
a person selected by his peers to run the
biggest educational institution in Vic-
toria.
The southern N.S.W. coalminers, most
of whom are in the Bulli electorate, have
cancelled their affiliation with the Lang
A.L.P., but the breach means no greater
schism than was previously indicated by
the polling at the Bulli by-election. The
bulk of the miners will continue to vote
for Sweeney and for Davies (Lang’s Min-
ister for Education), who hails from those
parts.
Queensland local authorities had some
hard things to say of the Forgan Smith
Government at their annual conference.
The Government has slipped £187,000
from the Main Roads Fund into consoli-
dated revenue; and the Main Roads
Commission needed every penny, for m
the Government’s elaborate closer-settle-
ment plan road-making will play a con-
siderable part. Home-Secretary Hanlon
addressed the conference, but was dumb
on the subject of the diverted funds.
“Old T.”: I listened to a Communist
spouter who referred darkly to “a last
desperate resort” in which “an appeal to
force may be necessary.” He added that
“if a man must die he had better die
fighting.” There is no necessity that any-
body should die fighting. Measles is a
good enough complaint to die of. People
have gone to peace conferences and died
there. Some have done it in Scripture;
some in mediaeval times. A Duke of
Burgundy went to see his sovereign lord
and was struck on the head with an axe.

Major Newland, V.C., broke all mili-
tary traditions in Launceston last week
by telling the S.P.C.A. that, while “spurs
are part of the military uniform and
many riders also wear them because they
are considered as flash,” those of the pre-
sent pattern are cruel, and not more ser-
viceable or ornamental than those of a
humane design which he demonstrated.
He also said something about leg ropes
and some other forms of animal torture.
Newland won his cross at Bapaume in ’l7
when 34 years old “for most conspicuous
bravery and devotion to duty in the face
of heavy odds on three separate occa-
sions.”
Over 50 mountain-peaks in the South-
ern Alps of Maoriland had never been
scaled until Pascoe, a solicitor of Christ-
church, added them to his list. Still in
his early thirties, he spends every spare
moment on his aerial pastime. He has
surveyed, and resurveyed, much wild
country in the South Island. Pascoe
weighs barely eight stone, and humps a
pack which an elephant would not be
ashamed to carry.
It is a paradox that the medical pro-
fession is not remarkable for longevity.
N.S.W. has lost its oldest doctor by the
death of Dr. de Lepervanche at 91. He
was a graduate of Paris University who
came to Australia in 1870, and immedi-
ately received an appointment as Gov-
ernment Medical Officer at Narrabri,
where he remained.
Captain Charles George Matheson,
now in Sydney after having been ap-
pointed Senior Commodore of the Orient
Line in succession to Captain H. G.
Staunton, is a blunt old seadog who has
been 40 years on the water, 30 of which
have been spent in the service of the
Orient Co. His first acquaintance with
Australia was in 1893, when he visited
Captain C. G. MATHESON, new Com-
modore of the Orient Line.
us as a midshipman on the barque Jupi-
ter. He got his D.S.O. for sinking a
submarine during the war. He is a com-
modore of the Royal Naval Reserve, as
well as of his company, and in 1931
acted as the King’s aide-de-camp at the
opening of Glasgow’s biggest dock.
Many of his friends expected him to get
a knighthood on that occasion, but “Sirs”
are still strictly confined to the Atlantic
service of the mercantile marine.
Old George Lansbury, leader of the
Opposition in the House of Commons,
once lived at Fortitude Valley, Brisbane.
He settled there with his wife and two
young children in 1884 and quarried blue
metal for a living, earning a shilling by
piecework on his first day. Then
he got a job—£4o a year and tucker-
working on a farm from sunrise till sun-
set. One of his duties consisted in milk-
ing 80 cows twice daily. He also gave
a hand in the laying-out of Brisbane’s
Exhibition Oval. It was a far cry in
those days to a seat in the British Com-
mons and the redesigning of the Serpen-
tine into a “London Lido.”
With the elevation of P. L. Griffiths,
McPhee’s Solicitor-General, the Tasman-
ian civil service gets its first silk for many
years. Griffiths is a sound scholar; he
P. L. GRIFFITHS, Tasmania’s Solicitor-
General and new K.C.
lectures at the University on the law of
wrongs, company law and bankruptcy
law. He is 52 years old, is an M.A. of
Melbourne and has been at the Bar since
1912. McPhee appointed him Solicitor-
General in September, 1930.
E. Byron Moore, who has been
allotted the telephone number “Central
No. 1” in Melbourne, owes the honor to
his father, who introduced Melbourne to
its first telephone service in 1881, a year
or so before the earliest telephone com-
pany operated in London. The pioneer
Byron Moore, whose whiskers are now
a fading memory with the habitues of
Flemington, found the introduction of
the new toy a difficult task, and his ori-
ginal company led a hard life during its
infant years.
If Edward Lambert a’Beckett, the
cricketer, who has been admitted to the
Victorian Bar, isn’t a good lawyer it won’t
be for want of experience in his family.
Four generations of a’Becketts (including
three Judges) have been associated with
the Bar in Melbourne since the first of the
clan, William went over from Syd-
ney as Resident Judge just on a century
ago. He later became Vic. Chief Justice.
Two of his brothers wore horsehair ; one,
Gilbert, became famous in London as
the author of the “Comic History of Eng-
land.” The tradition was carried on the
next generation by Thomas a’Beckett,
leader of the Victorian Equity Bar until
he became a Supreme Court Judge. The
family’s legal habit since his day has
been unbroken.
In Europe with Marshal Chang Hsueii-
Liang is Australian-born W. H. Donald,
who was on the old Sydney “Daily Tele-
graph” before he went to Shanghai upon
a newspaper job which grew into an-
other as publicist and adviser to chang-
ing Chinese Governments. Son of the
Donald who was once M.L.A. for Hart-
ley (N.S.W.) he began writing as a cub
on the Lithgow “Mercury.”
Passed out the other day, after a short
illness, “Sweet Nell” of Manly, at the
age of 60. With her barrow of sweets
Nellie Jane Sullivan was a familiar figure
on the beach and about the Corso for
many years ; a colorful figure with her
gaily-tinted barrow and her bizarre and
original habits of costume. She would
appear in spangled satin with a
plumed hat, the next day in riding-
breeches and a fez, and again in flowing
draperies with brown legs bared to the
ocean breezes. Most of these costumes
she designed and made herself. She was
always ready to help charities. Her
somewhat strident voice, calling her
wares —and with some humorous sallies
of her own added —will be missed from
the familiar places. .
Melbourne recently lost its first white
female child in Bridget Williams, of
Ararat. Ninety-five at the end, she had
proof that she was bom in a tent near
Latrobe-street in 1838, and she had a
vivid recollection of “Canvas Town,” the
city of tents in South Melbourne whither
immigrants flocked before housing could
be provided. "At 19 she married the late
Thomas Williams at Kilmore and had
nine children. Melbourne’s first white
male, Edward C. O. Howard, pf Kew, is
still going strong. He, too, is 95. He
was born in Lonsdale-street, not far away
from the site of the Williams homestead.
The passing of W. R. Louri, at 54, has
deprived the Mandated Territory of one
of its oldest inhabitants. A Maorilander,
he went to New Guinea in 1899 as an
engineer for the R. C. Mission. He will
be gratefully remembered as the founder
of the first ice-works in New Guinea cr
Papua. This was at the old German
capital of Herbertshdhe, now Kokopo.
but was later transferred to Rabaul,
where the proprietor ran a hotel in
connection with it. After the war Louri
became a plantation manager, and later
established a plantation of his own at
Gil Gil in the Namatani district.
Murdoch McLeod, once a master
mariner, but now the leading flour miller
of Wellington (N.S.W.), will receive a
warm welcome if he goes to Skye, where
he will be recognised at once as one of
the clan. He looks like a McLeod, he
sounds like a McLeod, and anybody who
has done business with him and noted
the genial Hebridean masterfulness with
which he gets his own way would swear
to him as a son of Dunvegan on sight.
He has been long a sort of fairy god-
father to Wellington, where his life has
been summed up as “just one kind deed
after another.”
Clifford Hay, whose job as Under-
Sec. to the N.S.W. Premier’s Department
is threatened by Stevens’s proposal to
abolish that concern, is one of the most
knowledgeable and experienced of N.S.W.
public servants and one of the best organ-
isers in Australia. He was in charge
of the arrangements for the visits of
the French Mission, the Prince of
CLIFFORD HAY, Secretary to the N. S.
Wales Premier’s Department.
Wales, the Duke of York, the Brit-
ish and U.S.A. Battle Squadrons. He
has been general secretary to most of the
conferences of Australian Premiers which
have taken place in the last 20 years, and
his public services have earned him the
C.B.E. and C.M.G. and a foreign deco-
ration or so.
John Eldershaw, the water-colorist, who
left Sydney 12 years ago to live in Tas-
mania, is back in his old home town
with a show of his latest paintings. The
artist bought the old mill and farm along-
side Tasmania’s famous Richmond
Bridge. Between water-colors he in-

dulges in his “hobby” of farming and
his favorite sport of trout-fishing. This
year he astounded all the local fishing
fabricators by landing a trout on
a dry fly at the Great Lake. Eldershaw,
while on a trip to Europe a few years
ago, exhibited at the Royal Academy
and the Paris Salon, and, although he
had just begun experimenting with litho-
graphy, had a print purchased by the
British Museum.
Queensland “Worker” held a competi-
tion to find the oldest member of the
A.W.U. Charles Sullivan and Dan Boyle
were the winners. Both had been on the
union books without a break since Febru-
ary 1, 1887. Sullivan’s ticket (No. 1) is
in the Mitchell Library.
J. D. Ross, who succeeds W. Mclntyre
as consumers’ representative on the
Queensland Meat Industry Board, is
senior inspector in the State Audit Office.
He was secretary of the royal commis-
sion which last year inquired into secret
commissions in the dairying industry, and
was a member of the board which re-
ported on the Mackay harbor scheme.
E. F. Sunners, the chairman, and F. M.
Bell, producers’ representative on the old
board, will continue with the new one,
which will function for a year only.
The newly-appointed president of the
Australian Institute of Mining and Metal-
lurgy, which will open its annual confer-
ence in Kalgoorlie on August 13, is F.
G. Brinsden, g.m. of the South Kalgurli.
A Victorian, educated at Ballarat, he
came to the eastern goldfields in 1902 to
work on the Kalgurli mine until 1920 ;
manager then, he resigned to direct the
affairs of the South Kalgurli. A keen
scientific miner, he is vice-president
of the Westralian Chamber of Mines,
a member of the 1.M.M., London, and
representative of the A.I.M.M. in W.A.,
as well as a member of the State commit-
tee of the Council for Industrial and
Scientific Research. In 1930, he repre-
sented the A.I.M.M. at the Mining Con-
gress in South Africa. Institute visitors
this month will find him a well of infor-
mation on latest mining developments in
Westralia.

The strengthening of £5211 in the year’s
profit, despite a cut to 5| p.c. in the maxi-
mum overdraft rate, and at balance day
a greater proportion of the funds in low-
interest liquid securities, suggests a slack-
ening off in bad-debts provision. It is a
heartening sign, especially when looked
at in conjunction with the results of other
key institutions, notably the B. H. Pty.,
which earned 10y p.c. on capital last
term. The C.B.S. writes its profits in one
figure, £259,077 last year, after providing
for bad debts and contingencies; the
showing was 5.7 p.c. on capital, com-
pared with 5.3, 9.3, 13.7 and 13.8 p.c.
in the four preceding years.
On funds profit was equal to no* more
than 2.8 p.c. The discrepancy between
borrowing and lending rates shrank more
in the bank’s favor last term. Clearances
in Sydney were still low, though there
has been more activity in the London
exchange. The season in N.S.W., Vic.
and Queensland, where the bank prin-
cipally operates, was not all that could
be desired; wool clips were lower, and
the recent gain in prices—the Sydney
index for wool was 118 in June com-
pared with 92 in March —did not affect
the bulk of the clip. Part of the rise is
sound, and can be attributed to a pro-
bable heavy fall in the S’African clip,
but speculation in the dollar, a dubious
prop, is also a factor.
Balance-sheet figures disclose a strong
banking position, which means moderate
earning power of funds:

The growth of £605,119 in deposits,
accompanied by an expansion of only
£125,762 in advances, is indicative of con-
ditions ; but a greater proportion of this
year’s deposits is free of interest. For
every £1 of its own funds the co. was
holding £5 os. Id. of the public’s money
at balance day, as against £4 19s. lOd.

At June 30 the accounts showed £4l
18s. of liquids for every £lOO owing to

The Government’s floating debt to the
bank was £1,060,000 lighter, but public
securities mounted £848,966 ; they are
taken in at less than their market value.
After handing shareholders 5 p.c. and
visibly striking £20,000 off premises,
£2127 was carried to reserves, now equal
to £ll 14s. per share paid to £l2 10s.
These, which carry a contingent liability
of £l2 10s. in the event of a wind-up,
the market prices at £l7 10s., against £l5
10s. 12 months ago. Return at the cur-
rent price is a shade under 3.6 p.c. on
a 5 p.c. div. basis, and prospects of a
higher distribution this year will depend
largely upon the course of wool prices
and the seasons.

Freight earnings depend upon activity
at the Barrier, the co. having the job of
hauling concentrates and supplies over
its 36-mile line, which links up Broken
Hill with the S.A. system at Cockburn.
The slump following the metal-price col-
lapse hit the co. in 1932 ; it freighted
141,000 tons less than in 1931. Last
term, however, there was a recovery of
23,309 tons, mainly due to more activity
in lead. Some of the zinc concentrates
have been railed to Cockle Creek, and
only 3674 tons more were hauled by the
co., as this comparison shows:

The new central power plant has affected
the coal figures. Gross income (£123,023)
recovered £17,277, and, including net
movements in depreciation and other re-
serves, the year’s profit strengthened by
£4954 to £47,761, being equal to 13.6
p.c. on the reduced capital, compared
with 8.5, 10.6 and 16.8 p.c. back to 1930.
A div. of 7.1 p.c. was declared, payable
after the accounts closed ; deducting it,
reserves figure at £210,700. They include
£67,484 earmarked for depreciation, and
£68,227 for repayment of capital.
Divs. were sweetened by a one-for-one
bonus issue in 1920, and £187,200 of gift
scrip had been scattered before that. But
the past is no guide to the future, profit-
earning and fixed-asset values depending
upon the life of the field and metal
prices.
Notwithstanding the return of £150,000
of capital (6s. per share) last term, Gov-
ernment stocks and cash are now almost
equal to another 3s. per share:

Growth in the more or less liquid sur-

£33,057, after allowing for the capital
returned. Fixed assets are reported in
good order.
At 225. the market values the 14s.
shares on a 44 p.c. basis, assuming that
the 7.1 p.c. recently declared is main-
tained.

Profit on transactions, £32,708, was
£9086 lower; deducting approximate re-
turns from investments, it was equal to
6.6 p.c. on the book value of properties
and advances. Exes., including rates and
taxes, were £849 lighter at £19,865. The
net result (£12,843, down £8237) was
equal to 4.9 p.c. on capital, as against
6.7 p.c. in 1932 and 13.7 p.c. in 1930.
The div. was kept steady at 5 p.c., a
tribute to the management’s foresight in
better times. General reserves are equal
to 12s. per 16s. share, there is £61,415
of specific reserves which may or may
not be required to adjust book values, and
further substantial internal provision
against losses exists.
Exhibited earnings are practically on
a cash basis; suspended interest is offset
against advances in the published
accounts. Also, the co. is trading on its
own funds, the debt (£5336, down £5571)
being trifling. Considering the temporary-
suspension of the co.’s rights by legisla-
tion, the inability-of some borrowers and
purchasers to pay their interest, and the
heavy property taxation, last year’s earn-
ings are indicative of control that should
reap the benefit of any improvement in
conditions. The year just past was par-
ticularly trying, but suburban building
activity during the six months to June
was more than double that of the corres-
ponding period of 1932.
The co. is not loaded with much vacant
land; repossessions (£27,322 net last
year) are mostly improved properties, and
have been let. Owing to the low
earning power of Government secu-
rities, the co. returned £52,000 of capi-
tal ; allowing for this, finances strength-
ened during the year:

Net reduction in advances and properties
last term was £26,064, as against £22,994
in the preceding year. After reducing the
debt as before mentioned, the cash thus
made available was nearly all left on
deposit. Allowing for the return of capi-
tal, the year’s improvement in the sur-
plus (£42,478) of readily-realisable liquids
was £18,239. In addition, shares in other
cos. figure at £12,214.
Management is in the same hands as
in the ’nineties. The investor who pays
17s. for the 16s. shares shows an imme-
diate return of 4.7 p.c. on his outlay at
last year’s div. rate, <md buys assets at
12s. 6d. per £1 of their book value, after
deducting all specific reserves and inter-
nal provisions. The directors consider
these ample under present conditions.
Considering that advances were made
over comparatively short periods, and
that repayments have been made on the
bulk of them, the co.’s scrip has many
attractions as a holding proposition.

Reserves equal to over £2 a share have
enabled this Brisbane motor- and radio-
agency and investment co., which re-
turned half its capital during the term, to
pay 8 p.c. divs. over the past two years.
Profits from trading were small for the
12 months to June 30 last; the subsi-
diaries ceased to operate on Nov. 1, stocks
(£43,709 at balance day) being taken over
by the parent, which showed net profit
(£6799) at £2938 lower than for 1932,
after charging the year’s taxation bill
(£1666) to tax reserves.
The co. established itself mainly on
careful handling of the Chev. car agency
during the good years, the greater por-
tion of earnings being put to reserves.
When it relinquished the General
Motors agency about the time slump
commenced, it was able to show very
strong finances. Thus, though the Morris
franchise has not turned in very much
since it was acquired, returns from
investments outside the business have
made an 8 p.c. div. possible.
The floating assets of the two subsi-
diaries—Howard Motors Pty., which
made a profit, and Autocars (Too-
woomba), Ltd., which showed a loss—
are being turned into cash. During the
year the co. received £33,200 from the
pups in anticipation of return of capital.
Deducting this, shares in subsidiaries
figure at £21,317; that allows for all
losses made to date.
The return of capital is mainly respon-
sible for the drop of £82,699 in book
debts, investments, etc.:

The item includes £22,045 of Inscribed
Stock and a substantial holding of listed
shares; these are considerably under-
valued on market quotations, the board
says. The reappearance of stocks
(£43,709) in the sheet absorbed the
advances made by the pups, and the cash
holding (£9081) shrank £7302. The out-
side debt (£9386, up £6829) is a small
item.
Whether reserves are worth their book
value depends mainly on the provision
made against possible losses on sundry
debtors and bills discounted, and whether
freeholds (£66,516) are earning their
keep. It is expected that the subsidiary
cos. will be wound up without loss. At
295. 6d. the shares return 5.4 p.c. on an
8 p.c. div. basis, and on book values
there is a margin of 33 s. additional secu-
rity (including taxation reserve) over and
above the purchase price.

Operations were extended to Victoria
and Maoriland during the year, and the
reduction in advances, etc., was only
£2737, as against a drop of £44,440 in
the previous term. Still, with nearly 2->
p.c. of the capital represented by cash,
and clumsy property legislation affecting
returns from the co.’s mortgages and
other securities, together with heavy and
unjust property taxation, there was a
drop of £1370 in the year’s profit (£5889),
written after providing £lO7l for future
taxes. No visible provision was made for
this unavoidable impost out of the pre-
vious year’s earnings. Losses (£2846) on
securities during the year were charged
to reserves, which, after handing share-
holders 2-} p.c., showed a net drop of
£2405.
The co. has always taken a clear-headed
view in conducting its operations; the
2s. per share struck off paid capital in
1931 was all in respect of flotation exes.
How much the co. will ultimately lose
on endorsed motor-car p.n.’s and mort-
gages can hardly be guessed at, and so
far the board has written off out of
visible reserves (£11,359) only those debts
definitely regarded as bad. But there is
some internal provision, particularly in
the shares-in-other-cos. item, £26,717,
down £3489 during the year. Some Stock
Exchange securities were realised during
the year at a profit; whether this is in-
cluded in the year’s earnings is not dis-
closed.
Finances are very comfortable:

A net profit of £17,378 is claimed, but
after adding £23,556 surplus on realisa-
tion of the P. J. Investment and Insurance
Co. to the previous year’s reserves, there
is an unexplained reduction of £1394,
deducted from profits in the introductory
table. Though disclosed earnings were
equal to only 6.2 p.c. on capital last
term, compared with 6.6 p.c. (including
unexplained additions) in 1933, the
market prices the 10s. scrip at 14s. 6d.,
at which figure the return is 4.1 p.c. on
a 6 p.c. div. basis, that being the rate of
the final distribution.
During the year the co. built a shark-
proof fence and promenade on the har-
bor beach at Manly ; these, despite un-
favorable weather conditions, were in-
strumental in drawing large crowds to
The Village. The expenditure, undis-
closed in the accounts, must be regarded
mainly as goodwill items, since, except
indirectly, they are non-revenue-produc-
ing. But the fact that the exhibited pro-
fit, written in one line in the accounts,
showed little movement last term may
mean that part of the present which the
co. is making to Manly has been charged
against the year’s income.
When the new dressing-pavilion is
opened next summer the co. will control
the best-equipped enclosed bathing area
in the State, it is claimed. But what it
cost can only be guessed at from these
figures:

"Includes investments.
Fixed assets and investments are now
lumped together at £326,548 ; increase
over the year was £89,893. How much
is liquid can only be guessed at, but
the co. has not been forced into debt to
finance capital outlay; the disclosed
liquid position is quite comfortable. The
surplus on the liquidation of the subsi-
diary helped, of course.
In 1929 ss. per share (£140,808) was
struck off capital to write down the fleet
to a basis more in keeping with its earn-
ing power. This was made necessary
because of lighter traffic, mounting costs
and the after-effects of the 1920 recon-
struction. The co. is now giving the
cheapest passenger service in the metro-
polis. Thus the Harbor Bridge hasn’t
diverted much patronage.
Net tangibles amount to 11s. 6d. per
share, practically all plant, its worth de-
pending upon what it will earn.

New Misima Gold Mines, Ltd., has
had an excellent year. Ore treated was
15,038 tons for 12,5940 z., valued, with
slag ashes, at £29,444, including ex-
change. Returns averaged £1 19s. 2d.
per ton of ore (up 4s. 7d.), and costs
absorbed 18s. 6d. Profit for the year
was £15,182. Twelve monthly dividends
aggregated 15s. per £1 share, and p. and
1. account shows credit balance ot
£16,148. Capital is only £14,000, there
is £BBO of liabilities, while cash ambunts
to £11,760. Ore reserves have increased
15,450 tons to 78,200 tons, average assay
value being 30s. Regular divs. are looked
for again this year.

The prospectus of Northern Gympie
Gold Mines is out: 80,000 contnbs.
offered at 55., 20,000 ss. deferreds to the
vendors and no cash consideration. The
lease holds 50 acres, and the co. has a
case for testing at the northern end of the
Gympie field, where a rush for leases set
in following an official report on the
area, which recommended its develop-
ment.
He H= * *
A trial crushing from the Crescent
lode at May Downs, Cloncurry, gave
total values of £6 ss. a ton for 12 tons,
and does not justify the rush of a couple
of months ago. Prospectors were then
officially advised not to stampede the field.
The values, however, should be payable
for a sft. lode with a local battery, and
it is intended to erect this if the ore is
proved to the 100 ft. level. At present the
lode is up to 6ft. wide at 50ft., and a
shaft is down over 80ft., and will cross-
cut at 100 ft. to prove the reef. Other
shows likely to help Cloncurry on to the
gold-producing list are the Comstock and
Mt. Freda. Garland Bros, have a parcel
ready out of these to send to Chillagoe
Smelters, a costly business.
* $ * . *
The gold-diviner appears to have come
another thud at Charters Towers. An
expert from Winton claimed to have
located an area that gave strong gold
reactions to the dowsing theory, and the
Towers supplied the cash. Five bores
were put down, three of them to over
400 ft., but as nothing was found that was
worth mining the test has been stopped.
But the dowser will crop up again some-
where else with unlimited confidence.

Queensland’s mineral production (ex-
cluding gold and coal) for June quarter
was valued at £292,492. Lead from Mt.
Isa totalled 14,307 tons (£172,914), and
silver from the same source 701,0910 z.,
worth £58,359. Tin-mining activity has
greatly increased with the higher price,
output being 170 tons t. 0., valued at
£21,659. The output of copper, from
Cloncurry and Mt. Morgan principally,
was 902 tons, as compared with 369 tons
in the previous quarter.
The Gilmore tinmine in the Mt.
Garnet district (N.Q.) is turning out to be
the best proposition in the northern tin
belt. It has been consistently producing
low-grade values for the past two years,
but the last crushing shows an improve-
ment to 44 p.c. tin oxide for 500 tons ore.
This is decent grade, and at present
prices the mine is highly profitable. It
is one of the well-known tin-pipe deposits,
of which the Vulcan at Irvinebank near
by made history up to 20 years ago.
* * H= sfc
The Sand-Queen Gladsome mines at
Comet Vale (W.A.), good producers in
the past, but at present unworkable
owing to the inflow of water, are likely
to be placed under further exemption
while Claude de Bernales, now in Lon-
don, attempts to secure capital for de-
veloping the property, 50 miles north of
Kalgoorlie. About £28,000 would be re-
quired to unwater the mines.
* * * *
The extension of the goldfields water-
supply scheme from Kalgoorlie to Ora
Banda has been completed. The exten-
sion is at present only to supplement sup-
plies from the dam; but reticulation to
any mining co. which wishes to develop
in a large way may be considered by the
Government. Goldfields Australian De-
velopment has four leases in the district,
while the Great Boulder Prop, is trying
out McKenzie’s find at Grant’s Patch, a
few miles away.
Jfc i*i Hi
Ingliston Consols (W.A.) provides a
good example of what gold at £7-odd an
ounce means. For the June quarter the
co. treated 10,563 tons for bullion valued
at £10,243 (gold 845.). Working expenses,
plus development, took £6409 more than
revenue. But with gold at its present
price there is a profit of £l2OO.
* * * . *
R. Agnew, of Goldfields Australian
Development Co., inspected the Augusta
mine at Laverton recently, over which
the co. has taken a 12-months’ option.
Values at depth will be tested. A lease
on the Cock of the North line of lode
was also looked at. Several old shows
are being worked in the district, which
has large and well defined ore-bodies,
including the old Ida mine.
$
South Kalgurli has substantially re-
duced its costs, though tonnage milled
has remained unaltered at 9700 tons
monthly. In June working costs were
28s. sd. per ton, compared with 345. in
May and 335. 3d. in April. This company
is looked upon as one of the best-man-
aged mines on the Golden Mile. The
co. has taken up several leases to the
south and east of the Lake View and
Star, and will undertake extensive de-
velopment.

“Cuzinjan”: During the present revival
in gold-mining great attention has been
given to the unwatering of old mines
“where lOdwt. stone was left when the
water came in”; little to the search
for new properties or the development
of large lower-grade mines, perhaps with
ore that presented a metallurgical pro-
blem in the early days. Reports on the
flooded-out mines are proving the fallacy
of the lOdwt. story; these crushings
appeared in one issue of a daily paper
recently: Lauraville Gold, Woods Point,
120 tons, lloz. ; South Virginia, Bendigo.
93 tons, 1 lioz.; Monument Hill, Ben-
digo, 1.12 tons, 120 z., and 52 tons, B|oz.;
New Red, White and Blue No. 2, 265
tons, 250 z. More prospecting and de-
velopment companies, well equipped and
soundly managed, are required.

Gawler River Gold has been formed in
Melbourne to acquire a lease of 136
acres at Ulverstone (Tas.). The lode is
stated to be 10ft. to 15ft. wide and
assays up to an ounce per ton. Little
work has been done at depth.
* * * *
The Little 180 Co.’s 10-head battery,
which has just been completed, is the first
new outfit on the Bendigo field for 25
years. Of modern design, the plant has
two special concentrating tables for the
collection of mineral. An additional 15-
head is to be added later. The ore so
far proved carries lower values than ore
profitably milled by other Bendigo cos.
A London co. has been formed with
a capital of £200,000 following negotia-
tions by the Victorian Alluvial Gold
Syndicate. Properties to be developed
include two large alluvial areas at Lisle
(Tas.), a lode at Alberton (Tas.) and the
Eureka Vineyard mine at Chewton (Vic.).
On this last-named property saddle-reef
formations similar to those at Bendigo
are believed to occur at depth, and this
theory is to be tested by sinking the
shaft to 1000 ft.
* * * *
Western Leads Mining, a Melbourne
co., is endeavoring to raise capital in
London to develop deep, leads between
Alfredton and Bunkers Hill (Vic.). An
area a mile lopg and 2500 ft. wide has
been pegged.
During 1932 Blackwater Mines, Reef-
ton (M.L.), treated 41,402 tons for 465.
6d. a ton, 3s. 6d. more than in the pre-
vious year. After providing £22,500 for
taxation net profit was £35,755. Divs.
totalled 2s. 6d. per share. Ore reserves
stand about the same at 75,435 tons,
assaying 9.6dwt. With gold at £6 an
ounce, co. believes that 4dwt. stone over
a width of 4ft. can be treated profitably.
There is a very large tonnage of this
grade available.

Siamese Tin Syndicate, which is de-
veloping a large tin-sluicing property at
St. Helens (Tas.), made a profit of £10,726
during 1932, after providing £15,551 for
dredge depreciation. A dividend of 10
per cent, has been declared.

A valuable contribution to the know-
ledge of gold-mining in Mandated New
Guinea is “The Development of Gold
Mining in Morobe,” by Harold Taylour
and I. W. Morley, published by the
Australasian Institute of Mining. The 80
pages include interesting photographs and
a map of the Bulolo and Edie Creek
mining areas. There is a brief sketch of
early gold enterprises on the main island
of New Guinea, and a history of the
prospecting ventures, mostly by Austra-
lian miners from Papua, before the war
and after, which led to the locating of
the present fields. Climatic, health and
labor conditions are clearly explained.
The progress of the leading mining cos.
is set out in a very informative fashion.
Authors’ conclusion is that most of the
easily-got-at gold on the fields has been
taken out by primitive methods, and that
the time for modern machinery has
arrived. Dealing as it does with the
Morobe district only, the book does not
dwell on the recent developments in pros-
pecting on the Ramu and Sepik rivers
to the north.

SHADOW SHOWS.
It’s sad that George Arliss should be
employed in such commonplace material
as “The Working Man,” at Sydney
Prince Edward. What a Savonarola or
Machiavelli he would make! In this
film he portrays a crotchety, prosperous
shoe manufacturer who is also an old-
fashioned sentimentalist. While on a
holiday he makes friends with Tommy
(Theodore Newton) and Jenny (Bette
Davis), orphan children of an old busi-
ness rival. Their family business is going
to min. He takes charge, and improves
matters to such purpose that he nearly
ruins the opposition—his own concern.
A merger between the rival firms brings
happiness to all—except, of course, the
consuming classes, and they aren’t repre-
sented in films of this kind.
The first half is unusually entertain-
ing. Molly de Gunst brought down the
house on the opening night in “The Jewel
Song,” “The Last Rose of Summer” and
“Cornin’ Thro’ the Rye.” Another gem,
of its sort, is the parody on “Grand
Hotel.”
“The Match King” has reached Syd-
ney Regent rather late. One of the ser-
vices which the cinema performs is to
act as a kind of running record of con-
temporary history, and the Kreuger crash
is already stale news. However, it is
a good melodrama on its merits. Warren
William is one of Nature’s Kreugers so
far as appearance goes; and he conveys
the requisite magnetism and diabolical
astuteness in conjunction with the irre-
sponsibility of a moral imbecile. Trail-
ing in his wake, as he flies from capital
to capital soothing and hoodwinking
financiers who have lent him money on
inadequate security, or on none at all,
are many beautiful women. One (Lili
Damita) is made up to resemble Greta
Garbo, who, according to the ballyhoo
merchants, numbered Kreuger among her
worshippers.
The suicide is effective. As the ruined
man stands on a balcony, revolver in
George Arliss in “The Working Man”
at Sydney Prince Edward.
hand, episodes from his past life drift
past his brain ; then the scene changes
to a bankers’ meeting, and there is a
shot. He has toppled over the balcony
into the gutter from which he came.
“Our Betters” is full of the gaffes which
are to be found in every American film
about England that isn’t produced under
English supervision. It opens with the
marriage of Constance Bennett and Lord
George Grayston, Baronet. Then Lord
George becomes Lord Grayston, and
fades out. The object of introducing
this Hollywoodesque blend of younger
son, baronet and. peer is "to show that
licentious English husbands are to blame
for the loose conduct of American wives
like Lady Grayston and the divorced
French duchess. Violet Kemble-Cooper
is superb as the duchess; on the other
hand, there isn’t an American inflection
in her voice or manner. The London
gigolo is a hard-faced young Hebrew
with a strong American accent. As a
go-getting Chicago salesman he would
no doubt be convincing; when his
poker jaw relaxes and he tries to simper
at his protectress he is inexpressibly pain-
ful. The English country-house scenes
are almost as American as he is. Grant
Mitchell, as the Anglicised expatriate, is
the best cast of a bad lot. Constance

Sydney Howard, star of “It’s a King,”
the new British comedy at the Mayfair,
belongs to the Chaplin-Laurel school, in-
asmuch as he depends for most of his
laughs on the pathetic gallantry with
which he stands up to the bludgeonings
of fate. In addition he has a busy, flut-
tering manner, suggestive of a nervous
old lady in unfamiliar surroundings,
which is extremely funny. Old stuff, of
course, like his other line, but he does it
unusually well.
In this show he plays a London insur-
ance-canvasser who goes to the Con-
Marion Davies with “Michael” in “Peg
o’ My Heart” at Sydney Lyceum.
tinent for his annual holiday and is mis-
taken for a king. The success of such
shows depends largely on the gag-mer-
chants. They have supplied Howard with
three or four good ideas, and he makes
the most of them; but by comparison
even with a Charlie Chase film “It’s A
King” is rather short of guffaws. The
direction and photography are excellent.
“Tell Me To-night,” the other, is one
of the few movies to which people go
over and over again, the attraction, of
course, being Jan Kiepura’s luscious
songs. It is in its third month and head-
ing for a record.

“Parole Girl,” at the Capitol, has a
flavor of O. Henry. Mae Clarke, shop-
lifter, goes to the pen determined to
avenge herself on Ralph Bellamy, the
young departmental store manager who
refused to let her go free. She marries
the gink when he is soused, love dawns,
and the rest is a yawn. The departmental
store sequences are well done ; the photo-
graphy (particularly the street night-
scenes) demonstrates that there isn’t
much an F 1.45 lens can’t catch, and
Marie Prevost gives a humorous picture
of a crook.
“The Nuisance” (M.-G.-M.) also ex-
ploits a racket —faked accident claims.
Madge Evans is employed as a decoy to
trap Lee Tracy, shyster lawyer. He mar-
ries her to make her evidence against
him null and void, and when she is
gaoled for perjury he compels the prose-
cutor —attorney for a street-car co. —to
call it off by getting the co.’s drivers and
conductors arrested for transgressing
long-forgotten city ordinances. Some of
the legal points are hard to swallow, but
British law has its statutory booby-traps,
too, and there’s no saying what might

happen in, say, Sydney, if somebody
sailed out with a book of railway, tram-
way and taxi regulations and threatened
to prosecute anyone found transgressing
them. Honors for character-portrayal in
this opus go to Frank Morgan, whose Dr.
Prescott, faker of X-ray photographs, is
so life-like as to suggest a living model.

“The White Sister,” at the State, dis-
closes Helen Hayes as the vivacious be-
trothed of a prosaic banker ; as the vic-
tim of passion (she is attracted by the
honeyed phrases and swashbuckling
manner of Clark Gable) and finally, after
Clark has been reported dead, as a nun.
Of course the young man returns (he has
been a prisoner of war) and tries to per-
suade her to renounce her vows, and of
course she refuses. So the heartbroken
Gable is shot down by Austrian airmen.
Miss Hayes’s acting is so sensitive and
sincere that she almost makes her wishy-
washy lines sound real.

The burning or threadbare question of
whether artists should marry is the
subject of discussion in “Made in
Heaven,” a temperamental comedy. by
Phyllis Morris, staged by the Little
Theatre at Melb. Kiosk. The artist in
the case, is a bad artist and a bad
husband, but he has enough good-
ness in him to hold his self-pitying wife,
a part played by Avis Crawford with
appeal. The well-chosen cast included
Gwen Munro, winner of a local film quest.
She gave to the sensible friend of the
family an easy stage manner, a deliber-
ate but monotonous way of speaking and
a reasonably extensive stock of modern
mannerisms. Frederic Speight played

The Spivakovsky trio continued to
fiddle and bang the ivories at Melb.
Town Hall all last week. Thursday’s
programme starred Beethoven’s Trio in
D Major, Op. 70, with its solemn middle
movement. Its only mate in the realm of
intellectual beauty was the elegiac
first movement of the Tschaikowsky trio,
Op. 50, which the composer dedicated to
Rubinstein. In the modern division was
Debussy’s sonata for ’cello and piano.
It has a part marked “Serenade” and it
struck this listener as the sort of thing
Mickey Mouse might have composed to
express the passion of his heart. Tossy’s
eloquent and persuasive violin has been
chief favorite with audiences, though
who plays a ’cello without the
usual frog in the throat, has run him
a good second for popular approval.

“Music in the Air” still holds the fort
at Sydney Royal. Dante is at the Cri.,
and presents his show on substantially the
same lines as were followed on his last
visit to Sydney. Peter Dawson threatens
a “positively last appearance” at the
Town Hall to-morrow night. His star
item at Saturday’s recital was “Nazareth,”
accompanied by the great organ. Popu-
lar enthusiasm waxed higher over “Glori-
ous Devon” and “The Mountains of
Mourne,” and culminated once again
with the singing of “I Travel the Road.”
Mr. Tapia-Caballero paid tributes to
Bach, Brahms and Chopin, and then
steered his muse into the more congenial
waters of De Falla, Palmgren, Albeniz
and Prokofieff. He plays the moderns
delightfully.

ney orchestra, augmented by the State
Theatre’s band and conducted by Hamil-
ton Webber, stormed through the “Wil-
liam Tell” overture very happily, and
then sunned itself in the melodies of
Tschaikowsky’s “Italian Capriccio.” A
selection from Straus’s “Waltz Dream”
was vastly appreciated. Violinist Robert
Acheson played the andante movement
from Wieniawski’s D Minor Concerto.
Ernest Truman, at the organ, played
Lemare’s Andantino in D Flat (better
known as “Moonlight and Roses”) and
the overture to “The Pirates of Pen-

voice, was heard in a group of lyrics.

Chausson, the French composer,
whose Symphony in B Flat was per-
formed by the Sydney Con. orchestra last
week, has learned something from
Mozart, something from Wagner, and
has not overlooked the fact that neither
of these exemplars was averse to melody.
In spirit he inclines more to Mozart than
to Wagner. Under Dr. Orchard’s baton
the orchestra gave a fair reading.
The same remarks apply to its treatment
of Vincent d’lndy’s “Enchanted Forest.”
The orchestra, released from the neces-
sity of discovering how far a modern
wanted to go one way and how far an-
other, launched into Mozart (“Marriage
of Figaro” overture); Haydn (Piano-
forte Concerto in D, with L. G. Smith at
the piano) and Beethoven (“Leonora”
overture No.'3) with such conspicuous
.success that the audience was constrained
to deplore the untimely demise of Wolf-
gang, Franz and Ludwig.
Melbourne will shortly have an oppor-
tunity of seeing the counterfeit present-
ment of Melba on the stage. The

amateur who confronts the critics in the

The Palette,
The Royal Art Society of N.S.W.,
whose annual show is in the Education
Department Gallery, Sydney, embraces
many painters of long experience, who
have discovered their metier, and while
the standard of its exhibitions is high,
visitors have a feeling that they know
exactly what to expect. There’s a sur-
prise for them this year in the canvases
of Syd Long —mostly landscapes, with a
fair amount of water in them. Color is
laid on in these in gorgeous style One
of the biggest pictures on view is Alfred
Coffey’s “Portal of a Great City,” a fine
impression of Sydney Heads. Erik Lang-
ker is to the fore with a bevy of genial
landscapes painted with great simplicity
and sincerity. Lister Lister’s canvases
radiate sunshine. In still-life there are a
dozen painters who show something worth
while ; most striking of the exhibits in
this genre is A. J. Sherman’s “Time of
Chrysanthemums.” A child study by
G. L. Trindall, “The Broken Doll,” is a
thing of beauty. In the pencil-study sec-
tion Douglas Pratt has a masterly draw-
ing, “Quirindi Meadows,” which goes to
the Gallery.

“Walkabout”: Woolbale, by means of
a twig, had divined a site for a bore.
“You’ll get a big flow of good water at a
thousand feet,” he told the driller. At
800 feet water as salty as the sea was
met with. “Serves me right,” wailed
Woolbale. “I used a saltbush twig instead
of one off a bottle-tree.”

“Mt. Abundance”: The Westralian
cold which froze the candle flame
(B. 26/7/’33) would leave a Western
Queenslander indifferent. Years ago I
was working with a Scotch jackeroo who
could never be induced to go into Roma
until they lit the town with bore gas.
Then he was a frequent visitor in
winter. We watched him and found

that when he went to bed in a pub he
left the gas full on. Next morning he
picked the icicles of frozen gas off the
bracket and, wrapping them up in news-
paper, took them back to the station.
During the winter he never spent a penny
on matches, lighting his pipe from a bit
of gas icicle which he ignited at his own
hair.

“The Bloke”: Sydney’s Zoo at
Taronga has been burgled by an enter-
prising individual who got away with a
batch of love-birds. He took them from
a big cage ; people saw him at work, but
concluded that he must be a Zoo official.
There was a recent Melbourne case
where a hold-up was staged in a main
street in broad daylight, passers-by being
under the impression that the affair was
a stunt for the movies. Hollywood has
case-hardened the mob. If an M.L.A.
rushed into Sydney’s Martin-place at
lunch time and voluntarily renounced his
gold pass and salary onlookers would
merely wonder which firm of news-reel
producers was busy.

“J. 8.”: The indignant remarks made
to juries by Queensland Judges re-
call Judge Fitzharding’s method in a
cattle-stealing case in N.S.W. The evi-
dence for the prosecution was as solid as
the rock of Gibraltar. The hide of the
animal stolen was exhibited and proved
to belong to Blank. Accused insisted that
it was the overcoat of his own steer. The
jury made it “Not guilty.” His Honor
didn’t flicker an eyelash. All he said
was, “I order that the hide in court be
returned to Mr. Blank, the owner.”

“0.W.W.”: When MacSwillem went
to share Henare’s whare, we station-
hands guessed that a thumping big row
was in the offing. About three weeks
later I was awakened at dawn by loud
roars of anguish and rage. Looking out
I saw the Scotsman, with blood stream-
ing from his badly-damaged nose, mak-
ing for the water-pump. Henare stood
at his whare door grinning broadly.
“What’s the trouble?” I called to him.
“Mac poke in his nose an’ strike fire-
works,” replied the native. “And what
did he poke it into?” “A preak-pack
rat-trap what I hafe set on a dark shelf,
when he sniffing round for peer.”

“Crossnibs”: Bent-leg Billy, shearers’
cook at a Warrego shed, hung up his
apron and said he would see Sydney.
At a pub on the way he met two genial
strangers. Next morning he woke up, in
the scrub back o’ the pub, hat inside
out, pockets reversed and boots off. Mc-
Froth sympathised with him. “I seen
tw r o blokes goin’ for th’ lick of their
lives to Ford’s Bridge,” he said. “Lose
much?” Billy stopped lacing his boots,
and a strange light dawned in his eyes.
“I was wondering why me pipe wouldn’t
draw,” he said, flourishing a large cherry-
wood pipe with a light surface of ash on
the tobacco in the bowl. “I’ve got four
tenners rolled up tight in here.”

“Cooramin”: If a chartered company
takes over a big lump of North Austra-
lia, it can count on a considerable num-
ber of livestock among the natural
resources. First, there are the Timor
ponies, hundreds of which have been
roaming wild in Arnhem Land for gen-
erations. They originated from some
that went bush from the military settle-
ment at Port Essington, where the first
lot was landed in 1840. They are fiery
little t brumbies, but very useful when
broken to harness. The late Paddy
Cahill, of Oenpelli, used to do a lot of
pony running, the captures being sold
in Darwin and elsewhere. The swamp
buffalo originated at the same dud settle-
ment. Though hundreds of thousands of
these have been shot, they are still
numerous. On the Barkly tableland and
thereabouts are mobs of wild horses,
large numbers of which have been shot
at various times for their scalps.

“Mere”: Dr. Arthur Thomson, sur-
geon-major to the 58th Regiment in the
’forties, made some tests to discover if
civilised man had deteriorated physi-
cally, experimenting on untutored Maoris
and British regulars. In a trial of strength
he found that tattooed Hori could lift
on an average 3671 b. one inch from the
ground, whereas Tommy Atkins could
master 4221 b. In a hundred yards’ sprint
Hori was a certain winner, but in a mile
and over Tommy could put it all over
him. Hori’s average weight, 10st.
stripped, and average height, sft. 61in.,
tallied to a fraction with that of the
pakeha. The discrepancy in lifting
power and in Hori’s lack of stamina
Thomson attributed to the prominence of
the non-muscle-building potato in the
native bill of fare.

“Fitch”: While endorsing “General
Prac’s” hope (B. 26/7/’33) that an in-
fluenza serum will be evolved from ex-
periments now being conducted with

been much exposed to the animals, that

stuffed ferret in his consulting-room, as
he suggests there wil be no need fot

“Beche-de-mer”: A diving-suit is cer-
tainly not a costume for the neophyte
(B. 26/7/’33). Among my ribald memo-
ries is one of a
distinguished lady
novelist who insisted
on going down in a
dress in Papuan
waters. The cutter’s
crew picked a place
about 12ft. deep with
a nice sandy bottom
and gave the lady
full instructions. As
we were watching
the pump, something
broke water with a
loud plop near by.
It was the novelist.
She had allowed her
dress to get too full
and, when she left
the bottom, the
heavy helmet and
foot-weights brought
head and heels to-
gether, with the re-
sult that the portion
of her anatomy that
showed above the
surface was that just
opposite the main
hinge of the body.
The inflated air
added to the effect,
and it was a laugh-
ter-shattered lot that
pulled her aboard.
The incident has not
been described in any of her novels.

“Surveyor”: Cats are intelligent all
right—big ones as well as little. On a
rubber estate in Malaya a pair of black
panthers had taken up their abode in a
piece of unfelled jungle along a stream.
The manager bagged the lady, hubby dis-
appearing into the jungle. The labor force
was marshalled and the jungle thoroughly
beaten—no panther. Returning home
along the stream, the manager’s atten-
tion was attracted by the outsize foot-
prints left in the mud by one of the
estate’s water-buffaloes on his way to
wallow. Closer, scrutiny disclosed that
the missing panther had used these hoof
marks, stepping carefully into each suc-
cessive imprint, to camouflage his tracks
to the stream. The same performance
was repeated when the animal left at
a patch of jungle two miles further up.

“Spangles”: Titania, a performing ele-
phant with the Cooper and Bailey circus,
had a playful habit of going through the
pockets of its trainer’s clothes. One day
at Auckland (M.L.) the man left his
waistcoat hanging handy to Ti’s trunk,
and she swallowed it. There was a box
of phosphorus matches in a pocket. The
circus dumped the corpse into the sea,
and next morning at dawn two fisher-
men woke the town up with the alarm-
ing news that the father of all marine
monsters was swimming up the harbor.
It was poor Titania floating home with
the tide. She is now one of the star
attractions of the museum at Christ-
church.

“Staging” : Several unusual dress-
diving happenings have been reported of
late. In a case from the Arus, a Japanese
diver was being pulled up from 17
fathoms. His helmet fouled the hauling
rope, and when he reached the sur-
face the big copper globe had been torn
off the dress. The diver was unconscious,
but recovered and was diving next day
the Japanese are hardy coves. Evidently
the Dutch inspectors don’t keep a keen
eye on the condition of the dresses on
the Aru patches. For the helmet to be
torn off in this fashion argues badly
perished fabric—it would be impossible
with a dress in good condition.

“Eoee”: Touching the pastoral tenden-
cies of ants. I have under observation
sugar-ants camped at the foot of a water-
gum well covered with mistletoe ( Lor an-
thus pend ulus), on the banks of the Mara-
noa (Q.). These ants live almost solely by
tending larvae of a butterfly, the purple
azure ( Ogyris zosine). The larvae have
excretory glands on each side of the
rear segment, from which they exude
sweet juices prized by the ants, In the
day they live in the ants’ nest, but
at night go forth to feed on the mistle-
toe, attended by the ants.* In the winter
the larvte do not pupate, but remain
dormant, rarely feeding, but still supply-
ing the ants with food. As the butter-
djes j ay their eggs on the mistletoe it
seems evident that the ants collect the
y oung larvae and bring them to their
nes t ? carrying them to and from the
mistletoe to feed until large enough to
go themselves,

“Segnalpa”: Some years ago I issued
cases o£ tinned rabbits to native-
manned luggers in Torres Strait in lieu ot
the usual beef. In every instance they
were returned intact, the crews having
made shift with what fish and turtles
“My old billy goat, ’e be just like one o’ the fam’ly, Jan."
“Which one, Tummas?”
they could catch. When I asked the
reason the reply came, “You see picture
on outside. Well, we fellers no savvy eat
pussy cat.” No persuasion of mine could
convince them that they had not been
victims of an economy drive. I later dis-
covered that they would eat no soft-
furred animal, not even wallabies. This
was all the more remarkable as one
island did quite an extensive trade with
Papua in dogs for human consumption.

“Runa”: Another famous navigator is
to have a memorial —Turi, greatest
of Maori sailormen, who navigated the
Aotea canoe the 1300 uncharted miles
to Patea, on the west coast of the North
Island. He settled there with his tribe
and achieved further fame as a mighty
warrior. The memorial will be a replica
of the Aotea, a canoe 55ft. long, set on
stone pillars carved with historical accu-
racy.

“M.L.C.”: The African honey-guide is
a bird which would have its uses in the
Australian bush. It is of a dull grey
color, tinged with olive or yellow, and
some six inches in size, and has the
cuckoo’s habit of putting its young out to
nurse; but its distinctive feature is a keen
relish for a feast of bee grubs. To satiate
this appetite it will attract the attention
of a human being by its loud call and
fluttering, and will direct him to a wild
bees’ nest in the hope of being rewarded
by a feed of grubs when the honey is
taken.
* * * *
“H.H.”: Octopus is sold regularly in
the fish markets of Southern Europe, and
the Polynesians are also keen to secure
it. But if you ask me why, I don’t know.
For many months I was awakened by
native boys smashing some unfortunate
octopus to death on the reef, and at last
I decided to try it myself. Selecting the
arms as the least repulsive part of the
creature, I put a couple of them into
the pot. They turned a bright red, but
were just as tough after three hours’ stew-
ing as at the beginning. I then minced
them and made rissoles. A better re-
sult would have been obtained, both as
regards tenderness and flavor, by frying
a disused motor-tyre.
* * * *
“Aplanges”: There is a use for beche-
de-mer intestines, whether voluntarily
ejected or forcibly removed. According
to native workers on North Queensland
boats they make a good poultice for
application to the painful wounds caused
by the stone-fish. Be this as it may, I
have personally found that treatment
similar to that of snakebite —incision and
injection of permanganate of potash—
is most successful. The agonising pain
only lasts for an hour or so instead of
a couple of days.

“Pick”: A white stringybark felled for
sawmilling in the Jingeras (N.S.W.) fur-
nished evidence respecting the age of a
tree when at regulation cutting size.
Six feet in circumference at the butt, and
32 feet in barrel, the tree had grown
from the fireplace of a long-disused pit-
sawyer’s hut. The old stone chimney
through which the trunk climbed sky-
ward had been a forest landmark for 65

“Akeake”: Maoriland’s wingless kiwi,
with its ungainly appearance and ridicu-
lous strut, is a bird which deserves a
place in “Specker’s” list (B. 28/6/’33),
for its nostrils, as though added as an
afterthought, are in the tip of its bill.
An ornithological joke, as it has been
termed, the kiwi has points of resem-
blance to the emu and ostrich family,
the barnyard fowl and the long-billed
wader, but its outstanding characteristic
is its intensely keen sense of hearing, and
in this respect it has mosquitoes and
midges licked to a frazzle. With head
cocked slightly to one side, it’ll strut
across the ground, detecting with the ear
the passage of the fat, juicy worms it
loves so well below the earth’s surface.
A quick thrust of the long bill, made
with unerring aim, a little delicate
manipulation, and forth comes the worm,
invariably unbroken.

“Le Glorieux”: It must have been cen-
turies since the Jap. was the worst seaman
in the Pacific. I have vivid recollections
of the harbor of Hakodate in the far
north ringed about with snow-clad moun-
tains, from which the winter blast de-
scends upon the waters in fierce gusts,
lashing them to fury. The harbor used
to be busy in my day with deceptively
unwieldy-looking sampans, the sails of
which consisted apparently of mats from
the fisherman’s floor. I have never seen
better seamanship than was displayed in
the handling of these soap-dishes. To
see one of them going about in the white
smother of a sudden squall was a liberal
education in the art of sailing.

“Murrungurry”: Though the last wool
clip was a record, many of the once-
famous big stations have been lost in
wheat-fields, and there are no Ma State
sheds now shearing 200,000 and over.
Toorale has dropped from 200,000 to
92,000. Dunlop, near Bourke,iathe 1890’s
shore 276,000 ; Big Burrawang, with 70
shearers, in one year put through
273,000; and Midkin, near Moree,
247,000. Other big sheds were Barra-
bogie, with a board of 70 shearers;
Urangeline, with 60 ; Tubbo, Gobbagum-
blain, Toganmain, Kerarbury and other
Riverina sheds, with 50 and over. On
the Queensland side, Milo, in 1909 shore
248,000. To-day it would be hard to find
a shed with 100,000 sheep and a board
of 40. Close settlement and rabbits have
been mainly responsible for the big re-
duction in the size of flocks.

“Dai R.”: I nominate George Jenkins,
of the Paroo River (Q.), as the driver of
the longest bullock-team in Australian
history. His total was 90, and they were
driven in two strings of 45 each, at Curra-
weena station, in the wool season of
1910. After heavy rain, such as occurred
at that time, the country thereabouts re-
mains terribly boggy under a dry crust
for weeks afterwards. Beneath a heavily
loaded wool-waggon this crust collapsed
under the off-side wheels, throwing the
vehicle over so that the wool touched the
ground. In the attempts at extrication
the original team was continually added
to till the total of 90 was reached.
Shearers and rouseabouts turned out
with persuaders. Beneath the strain the
chains broke twice, but eventually the
waggon was pulled to firmer ground
without mishap, which says a lot for the
honesty of the vehicle-builders of those
parts.

“Water Street”: The banana was cer-
tainly not a popular fruit in England in
the years that are gone (B. 26/7/’33),
but that was because of the condition
it used to arrive in from the West Indies
before the days of the modern fast fruit
steamers. As an exile from Queensland
I used to take back samples to school
to share with my friends, but few of the
latter ever asked for a second go at the
outlandish fruit. It was always black
externally and a rancid pulp within, and
only sentiment and, perhaps, patriotism,
enabled me to eat it myself. The cost
was then 3/- per dozen. In England to-
day, a friend tells me, bananas are
cheaper and better than they are in
Sydney.

to villages Or camps were turned over
at night in times of danger so that sen-
tries could see moving objects against
their silver-white under-surfaces. These

“Ah’m leavin’ if the cows beat that."
leaves were also used to wrap new-born
babies, and messages were left on trails
scratched on the white surfaces with
sharp sticks. The shoots of the koro-
miko were chewed and swallowed for
dysentery. Mourning women twined the
koromiko leaves m their hair. Fern root,
the pollen and roots of the raupo and the
heart shoots of the cabbage tree were all
regularly eaten. Hinau berries were made
into a cake much esteemed, hence the
proverb “When you disturb my rest, let
it be for hinau bread.” Hinau bark was
used to make brown dye, hinau gum to
prevent fading of tattoo marks. Oil from
titoki berries relieved earache, weak eyes,
sores and bruises.

“Akeake”: The recent discovery of a
solitary Buller’s mollymawk—previously
recorded only at Snare’s Island—at the
Chathams, 536 miles east of M.L., is a
reminder that both the Chathams and the
still more dreary, storm-swept Campbell
group, away to the south, are favorite
haunts of the albatross. The most inter-
esting species seen at the Chathams is the
shy mollymawk (Diomedea cauta). For
sheer bashfulness this white-capped fel-
low rivals the kiwi, but an old-time
whaler succeeded in making a pet of one.
The bird had a broken wing; the whaler
doctored it, and for several months after
it had recovered it regularly visited his
lonely shack, vanishing when there were
visitors. He told me the hardest part of
the job was inducing it to take food dur-
ing the first few days of its invalid life,
but once its reticence had been broken
down it became quite friendly and
appreciative. When it failed to turn up
after - a - spell of stormy weather, the
whaler felt he had lost a pal. At the
Campbell group a common sight is the
yellow-nosed or flat-billed mollymawk
(Diomedea chrysostoma ), rarely seen off
the Australian coast. Not much is known
about this fellow, and until somebody is
willing to put in a six months’ spell on
the uninviting Campbells he’ll remain an
enigma.
* * * *
“Bandy Andy”: That yarn about the
rat that rode the hen into the bush, where
the young rats were waiting to eat it
(B. 2/8/’33), reminds me of Charley the
Chump, who had a selection full of ring-
barked coolibahs and barefooted kids.
Among his stock was an old working bul-
lock he had broken to saddle. At nights,
about branding time, Charley would take
the bullock for a tour of a neighboring
station paddock. If there was anyone
about, he only saw an old bullock moon-
ing round. If there wasn’t Charley often
managed to get a little lot of cows and
calves into his place, where the kids would
be waiting ready at the yards like the
young rats. Early next morning, the
calves would have Charley’s brand
on and the cows would be back on their
own country. Tracks? Of course there
were, but never one of a horse tailing
them, or of human footprints either.
* * * *
“Six Mile”: Sir Leslie Wilson, the
State Governor, asked an assembly of
Queenslanders the other day why they
applied the Hollywooden-a/m-Mexican
term “rodeo” to their buckjumping and
cattle-throwing exhibitions at country
shows. He said he much preferred
“bushmen’s carnival.” Even better is the
title “camp muster,” which used to be
given these shows when they were first
staged for exhibition purposes. The
camp muster was an annual event in the
old days before general fencing, when
every station had a general muster on
the main cattle camps, and men from all
the stations came along to identify and
cut out their own cattle, with trials of
horsemanship as a sideline. These were
distinctively Australian affairs, and there
is no need to plaster a Western-American
label on their successors.
* * * *
“Bogaduck”: For an outsize in pests
I nominate the man who goes along out-
back tracks murdering every road-direc-
tion sign which he sees with a charge
of shot. Last summer I went out with
a garage owner and erected a hundred
direction signs on the back tracks of our
district, giving distances, nearest water-
supply and information as to where the
track led. They were free of any adver-
tising save the name of the garage in
one corner. I went along one of the
same tracks a week ago; every one
of the signs had been blown to pieces
with shot. It is the same on many of
the main roads, too; you come to a
finger-post and find that it bears only a
sheet of shot-riddled iron, on which not
a single letter can be deciphered. Are
we such a race of nitwits that we must
shoot at the most useful things along
the road.
* * * *
“Marathon”: Aboliars with records of
long-distance working horses are re-
quested to compare them with the per-
formances of two Lancashire nags which
have been getting their names into the
papers. One of them has done 34 years
on end on the farm of a Mrs. Halls-
worth, filling in spare moments on a milk
round. In his case the lady has called
it a day and pensioned her retainer off.
The other has a record of 33 years with
the Droysdale Milk Co., close by. The
co. considers that the steed is hardly due
for a full discharge yet, but works him
a mere three days a week on his round.
*** * -
“Beth Gelert”: Blood will yet be shed
over this Alsatian business. A dingo
showing traces of mixed parentage hav-
ing been killed up-country, the carcass
was conveyed to Sydney and a com-
mittee of three judges, men learned in
zoological and biological lore, was
appointed to settle if there was Alsatian
blood in the beast. It decided that there
wasn’t, but it is long odds that the anti-
Alsatians will refuse to accept the ver-
dict. A proposal put seriously for-
ward is that experiments should take
place to discover whether the Alsatian
and the dingo will mate —as if there were
any two canine varieties that wouldn’t
in certain circumstances! It would be
more sensible to cross the Alsatian and
the bloodhound; a blend would be the
ideal animal for police work. But
Heaven only knows what it would look
like!

“The 0.D.”: I hereby publicly and un-
reservedly apologise to James Crow. For
years I have ascribed to him certain
fiendish doings among lambing ewes and
other weak sheep. At Hawkesbury Col-
lege the other day, Kinghorn, the ornitho-
logist, told the assembled cockies that the
crow was almost entirely insectivorous ;
the raven was responsible for attacks on
livestock.
* * * *
“Squalus”: A result of the crab in-
vasion of Vic. fishing waters which has
surprised many people is the fact that sup-
plies of excellent fish were never
more plentiful, though some of
the favorite fishing grounds have
been temporarily closed by crab
occupation. Someone has let
the cat out of the bag by point-
ing out that ousted fishermen
have been going to sea hand-
lining, catching the sharks which
are numerous there at this
season. Many folk who have
been taking advantage of the
glut of choice fillets and other
inviting seafruit which has been
selling as snapper, trumpeter
and what not have been think-
ing hard and resolving to swear
off fish diet until next Easter at
least, by which time the crabs
should have departed.
* # * *
“Waranbini”: The only big
cattle-run in Central Queens-
land that has not lost any part
of its original area is Raspberry
Creek. It is a good run, but
when it was pioneered by
squatter Huish in the ’fifties the
blacks were so troublesome that
he got fed up and sold the whole
show to James Ross for a bottle
of champagne. Another cheap
station was Currawilla, on Far-
rar’s Creek, a tributary of the
Diamantina. It was given by John
Costello to Jack Farrar, an old stockman
and drover of his, after whom the creek
was named.
* * * *
“Macropus”: It would appear that
contact with the sophistication of other
lands is corrupting our native fauna.
According to a London journal, the kan-
garoos and wallabies in the open-air zoo
at Whipsnade have taken to blackmail-
ing the motorists who are allowed to
drive along the park roads on certain
days of the week. On days when the
roads are closed to motors, the animals
take no notice of them, but stick to the
fields. On motor days they throng down
on to the roads and refuse to move until
they are fed by the motorists, who are
compelled to pull up to avoid running
over them.
* * * *
Some of our politicians and
economists might well have a glance at
Chauvel’s film, “In the Wake of the
Bounty,” and ponder over the condition
of the Pitcairners. Marooned on an
out-of-the-way and none-too-productive
island, the Bounty descendants live under
industrial conditions so primitive that
there is not even a circular saw in the
whole community, the logs being sawn
up in the old-time sawpit. Yet the popu-
lation is warmly clad, well fed and lives
in cottages which compare more than
favorably with those of almost any indus-
trial suburb in Australia, and are many
degrees ahead of the shacks which dis-
figure some of our coalfields. There is
almost an entire absence of mechanical
devices on Pitcairn, yet there are no un-
employed, and the people live in greater
comfort than many Australians who have
work, not to mention those on the dole.
THE FERRET AND THE ’FLU.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
O ferret, ferret, slinking, lean and furtive,
I rather fancied you in boyhood’s days,
Although your smell was far from unassertive
And memories of violets failed to raise;
Still, spite of all objectionable habits
(Including vicious nips) that might repel,
I owe you many a day’s rare sport with rabbits
And some with rats as well.
O ferret, ferret, polecat or albino,
To dark and bloody ways you’re used, 1 trow;
You’re booked, although you cannot know
what we know,
Upon a higher, nobler mission now.
You’re picked from all creation, tame or ferum,
Fish, flesh and fowl and good red herring
too,
To furnish doctors with the sort of serum
That wallops out the ’flu.
O ferret, ferret, cousin of the sinuous
Weasel and eke the somewhat stockier stoat.
You sleuth your rodent prey with vim con-
tinuous . , ,
Until your fangs are fast in bunny s throat.
Your blood-lust was a trifle apt to chill us,
But now ’twill win you fame assured and
firm ■
If you can catch a certain vile bacillus
And nab a noxious germ.
O ferret, ferret, type of grim reliance,
Exemplar Of unslackening pursuit,
Your hour has come at last. She needs you,
Science,
Far more than mice, and guinea-pigs to boot.
You’ve never been employed for vivisection,
Like less aggressive bucks and gentler does,
And why you’ve topped the pole in this selec-
tion
The Devil only knows!
O ferret, ferret, often (mostly muzzled)
I’ve sped you on your way or gripped you
fast, . .
And none the less it has me fairly puzzled,
This latest role for which your tribe is cast.
Still, if you manifest the same fierce frenzy
With which you fasten on a furry foe,
You yet may cop bacillus influenza,
Pro bono publico.

weakness in the back makes me feel exhausted. . . . Pains in the muscles —I
just can’t get on with my work.”

AUDITORS’ REPORT.
Messrs. Soak and Soak,
Darlinghurst.
Gentlemen, —
Having examined your current Balance
Sheet, we wish to draw your attention
to the following points:
The increased turnover in your Plonk
Department is highly satisfactory. It is
due, no doubt, to the substitution of
turps, for metho. in your latest Red Ned
Cocktails. The popularity of this line
should continue if
you persevere in
selling only the
best.
Regarding your
Raid Reserve
Account, we con-
si de r that this
should be in-
creased, for, in the
event of police in-
terfering with your
business again, the
Judge is liable to
be prejudiced by
your previous con-
victions.
Some slight ad-
justments are re-
quired among your
Assets. The bar-
maid (ash blonde)
who lost an eye
during the infor-
mal affray on the
15th ult. must be
omitted from the
Balance Sheet, as
she is now of no
value. We advise
depreciation in con-
nection with an-
Jther barmaid (per-
oxide blonde)
whom we noticed.
on our last visit, to be showing signs of
wear.
The recent inclusion of Metho. Mary
in your staff was a wise move; her
numerous acquaintances should justify
you in increasing the value of your
Goodwill.
We consider that the sudden falling
off in the business of your Snow Depart-
ment is due to the much-regretted incar-
ceration of Cocaine Kit.
Yours faithfully,

MEGGITT'S LINSEED
TENDER WOOLS.
“Murrawong”: Due to bad seasons a
shortage of shafty, well-nourished wool
from the early-shearing districts is likely
this year. The wool is finer in quality
than last year, but it is a deceptive
“hunger-fineness”—light, thin and tending
to wastiness. There is also a greater
percentage of tender wool, the handling
of which offers a puzzle to the inexperi-
enced classer. When tested for tensile
quality some wools have a well-defined
break, others give way as though the
wool were generally rotten; some fleeces
are sound in one part and tender in
others.
It is inadvisable to make too many
lines, even though bins are available,
which is very seldom. Where the bulk
of the flock is sound, keep the tender
wool out and brand it “Ist Fleece.” If
only a few fleeces are sound, treat the
entire clip as tender. Class into the
usual sorts, but don’t brand any line
“Combing.” If the wool coming to the
classer’s table contains sound, tender and
part-tender wools, the following layout
for a large flock will best suit buyers’ re-
quirements : In an average clip of
medium to strong qualities, make the
top line, branded AAA, of sound fleeces
of good average length and medium
quality. The second line, AA, should
consist of the part-tender fleeces of simi-
lar quality. A, the third line, will take
the wholly-tender fleeces. If there are
enough sound fleeces of 60’s quality to
make a fine bale line, do so, but, if not,
treat it all as tender and brand 888.
One other line, 88, takes the cast fleeces
from all other lines —discolored, webby
or cotted. One more will be B, branded
for the short-stapled fleeces.
In a small, tender clip, do not separate
medium and strong wools, but keep out
comeback and crossbred. Merino lines
should be: AAA, sound fleeces of aver-
age length ; AA, tender and part-tender ;
A, short fleeces ; B, dingy, discolored and
cotted fleeces. When sounding a staple
for tensile strength, there is no need to
exert a lot of strength to try to break
it. Hold one end of the staple between
the finger and thumb of the left hand,
the other end between a finger and thumb
of the right, and flick the stretched
staple smartly with the third finger of the
right hand. It is only necessary to
ascertain if the wool will stand the strain
imposed by the combs, not whether it
can support the weight of a 14-stone man.
THIS ALSATIAN QUESTION.
“Koepek”: This importation of Alsa-
tians might be all right if Australia were
not Australia, and if we were sure of
the effect of Alsatian crossing. Through
the Balkan countries and Asia Minor
every village has dozens of dogs which
are very obviously of the same basic
origin as the Alsatian, and I certainly do
not wish to see those fellows here in any
numbers, even if the climate does not
affect their size. I have watched them
by the hour. Their habits are exactly
those of our dingo. They ring game in the
same way. They tear rather than bite.
They will follow a stranger and slink
when observed ; but they differ from the
dingo in that they have no fear of man.
'Five minutes which I and two other
able-bodied men spent keeping a half-
dozen of them out of a motor-car with
tyre-levers will not be forgotten for a
long time. Furthermore, I was warned
in the villages that they were entirely un-
reliable with strangers, and that it was
unwise to turn a back on them —another
dingo characteristic.
The Australian climate plays strange
tricks with the size of animals. Nobody
would have suggested 30 years ago that
there was any danger in letting loose the
ordinary domestic cat. Yet the descend-
ants of stray pussies, having wiped out
most of the western ground game in
Queensland and N. S. Wales, have now
become large enough to tackle lambs,
and, in 1924, in Central Australia, I shot
one which had been big and cunning
enough to stalk and pull down an eagle-
hawk with nearly a five-foot wing span,
which it was devouring.
Let an Alsatian, the most intelligent
canine alive, develop on this scale, and
multiply as the cat has multiplied on the
Western Plains and we should have some-
thing a bit larger and more dangerous
than the leopard. Much as I like
the Alsatian, his presence here is not
worth the risk, whatever the kennel clubs
and enthusiasts with only suburban ex-
perience may think.
THE AMATEUR GRINDER.
“Beckton”: “Liss” (B. 12/7/’33) makes
two mistakes in his hints to the amateur
grinder. The pendulum should hang at
least an inch from the face of the disc
and opposite the centre of its radius —
not the outside edge. The same applies
to grinding of cutters. I have been ex-
perting .for over 20 years and, when-
ever possible, I make up my discs three
days before they are needed. Not only
do they not sweat in the clamp, but they
last twice as long; a “green” lap has not
had time to dry properly, and the emery
still holds the moisture. Put the disc in
the sun or in a warm place before using.
I have shorn over 4000 sheep from one
set of laps and crutched 14,000 with a
similar number. Cheap emery, by the
way, is the dearest in the end.
FARRER’S WORLD TRIUMPH.
The outstanding feature in the news of
the successes at the World Grain Exhibi-
tion at Regina (Canada) appears to be
that Canadian wheatgrowers won the
“crown” in the red-wheat section, and
Australia won it in the white-wheat sec-
tion. Not only did Australia win the
“white crown,” but she carried off all
prizes in the section, excepting the 23rd.
Here, surely, appears to be a declaration
that within the British Empire the import
needs of the world can be supplied with
the finest red and white wheats.
Another important feature to Austra-
lia is the fact that the late William
Farrer’s work of cross-breeding in wheats
still stands supreme, because Mr. Eade,
of Euchareena, near Molong, won the
championship prize in the white-wheat
section with a variety (a crossing of his
own) bred from a Farrer strain. Most
other “white” prizes awarded were for
Comeback and Florence, typical wheats
bred by Farrer.
Farrer’s way is still the best, and any
student wishing to wear his mantle can-
not do better than study his technique.
DRAUGHT-HORSE SALES.
“J. Want”: R. P. Greer, of Emerald
Hill (N.S.W.), some time ago calculated
that ploughing 400 acres with a 10-furrow
tractor unit cost 2s. 7d. an acre, compared
with Is. 7d. per acre on a 100-acres basis
with an eight-horse team.
The Victorian sales of draught horses
held by Campbell and Son last week re-
flect the wider spread of this conviction,
which the Sydney sales also support.
Bidders came from every State in the
Commonwealth. Horses were offered not
only from Australian studs ; 25 Maori-
land sires were submitted. The best price
realised was 470 guineas for a four-year-
old colt, Sunnylands Craig Fashion, by
the well-known Nether Craigends, bred
by the executors of the late T. H. Payne ;
and there were one sale at 300 guineas
(by the same sire as the market top), one
at 275 guineas (the best figure for
M.L.-ers), one at 250 guineas and a num-
ber ranging from 100 guineas to 1674-
guineas.
We have yet to learn what the transfer
from horse-hauled to machine-hauled
field machinery and tractors has cost the
country in spending power. The N. S.
Wales Statistician says in a report that
the “number of persons engaged perman-
ently in agriculture is now (1929-30) 36
per cent, less than in the years immedi-
ately preceding the war, although the area
under crop is greater.” He adds:
The explanation apparently lies in the more
extensive use of tractors and in the improve-
ments in agricultural machinery, by which the
capacity of ploughs, harvesters, reapers and
binders and other plant has been increased in
such a way that less man-power is required to
cultivate the greater area of land devoted to
agriculture.
In the U.S.A., according to the official
“Year Book of Agriculture” (1932), “the
increasing use of the tractor has resulted
in a 65 per cent, to 85 per cent, decrease
in the amount of direct labor per acre....
and in an increase of cash expense in the
farm and the size of the farm unit.” The
American Horse Society has calculated
that the decline in the number of horses
and mules in use in rural industry in the
States between 1920-30 was 6,437,000,
and in the cities 600,000 —total 7,037,000;
while the decline in value per horse to
the producer-seller has been from 104.24
dollars in 1918 to 53.37 dollars in 1932.
The society further reckons that if the
ratio of increase in horses current before
power introduction on a large scale to
farming had been maintained, the actual
number of horses in use in 1932 would
have been 38,965,000, or 18,700,000 more
than the fact, and that the actual area
required to support the increment would
be about 52,000,000 acres.
The best indication of the number of
people to whom a complete rural return
to the horse might give employment in
the U.S.A. may be gauged from the fact
that 650,000 persons per annum have
been retiring from the country to the
larger towns since the power era came
into full blast —6,000,000 have already
left the farms and hamlets, and man-labor
requirement in the big corn belt and
wheat States has dwindled relatively from
14 hours to two hours per acre.
It would be interesting to see Austra-
lian figures on the question.
FEEDING FOR MILK.
“H.D.8.”: The best milk-production
ration will depend on the natural condi-
tions. The first essential for high produc-
tion is that the cow should be in good or
even fat condition when calving. To
assure this may necessitate feeding with
chaff and bran before calving.
Immediately after calving give the cow
a drench consisting of Epsom salts 11b.,
ground ginger loz., and one cup of
treacle in about \\ pints of warm water.
Feed as much green feed, especially
lucerne if procurable, and as much chaff,
oaten for preference, as the beast can
comfortably consume. The amount will
depend on the quality of the roughage
in the pasture.
Further, at each milking give con-
centrates consisting of the following
mixture: Bran 1001 b., crushed oats 1001 b.,
linseed meal 201 b. Start feeding this mix-
ture at the rate of lib. to each 41b. of
milk the cow is producing. A cow giv-
ing 401 b. of milk per day should get
101 b. of the mixture in two feeds. If the
production increases, the concentrates can
be increased to lib. to each 3\Vo. of milk
but no farther, as there is a likelihood of
causing digestive trouble if concentrates
are overfed.
If the pastures are dry and no green
feed is to be had, damp the next day’s
feed of chaff overnight with molasses
diluted with water (about half-pint of
molasses per cow). And don’t forget a
mineral lick and a handy fresh-water
supply. Watering a cow only in the
morning and evening does not help the
milk flow.
THE HEIGHT OF MAIZE.
“Tellem”: Re “C.J.B.’s” criticism of
my article on the selection of seed maize
(B. 19/7/’33). Of course the varieties he
names cannot be compared in habits or
yields. My article mainly applied to North
Coast (N.S.W.) crops, as any farmer read-
ing it would know. For instance, I said
pick cobs “well covered by the husk,
hanging down, and growing about five
feet from the ground.” Naturally, any-
one knowing anything about corn would
not look for these habits in Wellingrove
and Funk’s Yellow Dent. These varieties
are grown in dry, weevil-free districts, not
on the humid coast, so that they do not
get the climate to induce heavy stalk
growth and do not have good husks, or
pendant cobs to shed rain. The habits
I mentioned do apply to Fitzroy, how-
ever.
On good coastal land Fitzroy grows
to 15 feet high. The cobs are usually
high, but by selection can be induced to
grow about five feet from the ground
to facilitate pulling. The ears of coastal
corn certainly should hang down —to
shed rain. Though not such a tall grower
as Fitzroy, the same remarks apply to
Large Red Hogan. Husking at pulling
is not practised on the coast, only in
weevil-free country, as where Wellin-
grove and Funk’s Yellow Dent thrive.
FERTILISING POTATOES.
“Newlyn”: The results of this year’s
Victorian D. of A. experiments in fer-
tilising potatoes is a lesson for farmers
who don’t think it worth while to buy
a little super. In every one of five
localities the results were more than pay-
able, except in very rich soils.
At Koroit, 3cwt. of super, per acre
increased the yield by 1 ton scwt. per
acre, or 13 per cent., while 3cwt. of
market-garden fertiliser or 3cwt. super.,
plus lcwt. ammonium sulphate gave
similar results. The last-named mixture
made up with 2cwt. of amm. sulph. im-
proved the yield by 1 ton lOcwt., or 16
per cent. These results on some of the
best potato land in Australia were, how-
ever, largely due to green-manuring rich,
unmanured land. It was on the poorer-
yielding lands that the big profit from
the artificial manures was shown.
Musk lands, which gave, under test,
an unmanured output of 3 tons lOcwt.
per acre, produced 6 tons 3cwt. per acre,
an increase in crop of 76 per cent, when
treated with the 3cwt. super and 2cwt.
sulph. amm. mixture; at Beech Forest,
6cwt. super, and 2cwt. sulph. amm. gave
72 per cent, improvement on an unfer-
tilised 4|-ton yield, whereas blood and
bone increased the output only 28 per
cent. The best results of all came from
Trentham East, where the soil is very
light-red volcanic loam. There even
basic phosphate (3cwt. p.a.) added to the
crop by 90 per cent, and the 3-super.-2-
sulph. amm. produced a 4-ton p.a. yield,
where unmanured soil produced only 1
ton per acre.
THE WOES OF A NOVICE.
“C.L.”: I’ve been in the banana-grow-
ing game only a little over 12 months, but
I’ve learnt a lot about it already.
In November I planted three acres. I
soon noticed that the leaves of some plants
were different from the others. The in-
spector told me it was bunchy-top and
ordered me to root them out. Every
week or so since I’ve been eradicating
“bunchies.” It was no fault of mine.

The plantation whence the infected
suckers came was inspected before per-
mission was given to shift them ; but I
attach no blame to the inspector, for the
number of plantations he must visit and the
area he has to cover are so extensive that
an inspection at its best is only cursory.
Again, there are few plantations in
South Queensland or the Tweed free from
bunchy-top these days. I was cleaning
around the base of a stool in an acre of
established bananas when I noticed a
small black beetle with a trunk like an ele-
phant’s. Comparing him with some pic-
tures in an agricultural journal I made
the discovery that he was another of the
banana-growers’ cobbers —the borer
beetle. Every bunch I cut now I split
the old stalk lengthwise, allowing it to
dry up, and the old butt I dust with a
mixture of Paris green and flour, one
ounce Paris green to six of flour (by
weight). It means a lot of extra work and
anxiety.
In my opinion the beetle is worse than
bunchy-top ; you can see the “bunchy”
and with vigilance stamp it out, but
the beetle-borer works quietly under
cover and the devastation is done before
one realises it. A lot of the undersized
fruit going on the Brisbane market to-day
is the result of beetle-borer infestation.
Banana-growing is a continuous fight
against disease and pests ; and the grower
who doesn’t fight is a traitor to the in-
dustry and a menace to his neighbors.
QUESTIONS ANSWERED.
(Transferred from Service Department.)
(1) Where and by whom were the first
merino sheep introduced to A ustralia ?
(2) Were previous attempts made to
obtain the best kind of sheep for wool-
growing?—7ll3.
(1) Governor Phillip bought 70 head
of sheep at the Cape and officers of the
First Fleet also bought a few. Most died,
however, after landing in 1788. In 1793
30 head of Bengals were brought from
India and bought by John Macarthur.
(2) The first merinos were Spanish sheep
secured at Capetown and landed by Gov-
ernor King and Captain Waterhouse, of
the Reliance, in 1797. ’VV’aterhouse sold
most of his purchases to Captains Kent,
Macarthur and Rowley and the Rev.
Samuel Marsden.
On what side should the reins be hung
up on a horse when taking him out of
harness ? —6797.
A horse is always worked and
handled from his “near” or left side,
and on that side the reins must be hung.
How to prevent splitting of ends of
timber during seasoning ? —7336.
Stack under cover and apply a coat of
paint or petrolatum to the ends.
Means of trapping and poisoning
water-rats ? —7259.
Poisoning is not practicable. Use
ordinary spring-back rat-traps.
Method of making (1) a soft cheese
similar to that sold in cartons, wrapped
in tinfoil ? (2) A very soft cheese, such
as is sold in tins ? —7OBB.
(1) Put well-matured cheddar cheese
through a meat-mincing machine, place
in a saucepan, add small quantity of
water and heat gradually, stirring rapidly
meanwhile until a temperature of 145 deg.
Fahr. has been reached, and maintain for
20 minutes. The amount of water in-
corporated should be sufficient to give
the pasteurised product a creamy con-
sistency. A small quantity of tri-sodium
phosphate dissolved in the added water
would assist in preventing the fat from
oiling off. While still hot, the cheese
should be poured into a glass container
or moulds. Tinfoil is used to prevent
mould growth. (2) Obtain leaflet
“Home-made Cheese,” describing three
types of home-made cheese, including a
soft cheese, from Dept, of Agriculture,
Sydney.
How to treat citrus trees that are dying
off through attacks of white qrubs ? — L
7103.
One method is to insert pliable wire
into the borer channel until it reaches
and kills the grubs. Another way is to
seal all holes save one with putty or stiff
clay. A small wad of cotton-wool satu-
rated in carbon bisulphide is then inserted
through the unsealed hole in the bark,
which is subsequently plugged in the
same way as the others. If these methods
do not give satisfaction, forward speci-
mens to J. Harold Smith, Entomologist,
Department of Agriculture and Stock,
Atherton, N.Q.
(1) Correct way to pack tomatoes —on
their ends or on their sides, or can they
be packed both ways in the same case ?
(2) Rules for grading ? (3) Any books on
the subject ?— 6957.
(1) The fruit should be placed on the
cheek, producing ah even surface on
each layer. The second and alternate
layers in each pack must not rest directly
on top of the fruit beneath, but in the
tight; it carries badly
packed loosely. (2) For good packing
close grading is necessary, and experience
is essential to know the best case to use.
Where half-bushel dump cases are used
certain sizes fit better by making the side
the top of the case. Grape cases are
commonly used for the larger-sized fruit.
At certain periods of the year, such as
when the first fruits come in, the quantity
is insufficient as a rule to close-grade, and
no systematic pack can be adopted. The
grading regulations, however, must be
observed, and, in any one case, the size
of the tomatoes must not vary more than
an inch in diameter. The fruit should be
graded for color as well as for size. (3)
No book known, but some additional in-
formation has been posted to you.
HINTS FOR THE FARM.
“Granova”: Sheep that have been liv-
ing for months on dry feed and hand-
fed fodders become very weak when first
turned on to young green feed. Give
them a small quantity of oats until they
regain their strength. If you don’t cold,
wet weather is likely to cause heavy
losses and much of your expense and
trouble in hand-feeding will have been
in vain.
“Gumblegubbin”: Keep an eye on
your wood-box, particularly if it stands
inside. It is a common means by which
white ants (termites) gain entry to a
building. The box should be removed
and tipped out at least once a fortnight.
“A.C.8.”: Don’t sow lucerne seed too
thickly. In good alluvial land the allow-
ance should not be more than 91b. per
acre. For pasturage 2\\b. per acre is
enough. Seed should not be covered
with more than |in. of soil or it will not
germinate properly. Only triple-cleaned
seed should be used, as no seed carries
more bad weeds than lucerne.
“Rotom”: To make the best thistle- or
bur-hook known, beat and bend the
haft of an old shear-blade, and with thin
wire bind it at an angle of 45deg. to a
straight slender sapling.
“Johnno”: A pickle-bottle makes a
good blowfly trap. Fit into its mouth a
piece of flexible tin or stiff paper shaped
like a lolly packet, leaving a hole at the
lower end big enough to admit a large
blowfly. Put about an inch of water into
the bottle, and drop into it a bit of
fresh meat, or something already smelly.
Stand the bottle in the paddock where
it cannot be knocked over, or hang it
from the low branch of a small tree.
There is no need to replenish the bait till
the bottle is full. The trapped flies
themselves will provide bait.
“Eureka”: When planting pumpkin or
melon seeds include a few radish seeds
amongst them. The radishes will keep
the pumpkin beetles away.
“Tena”: Wind-broken limbs should be
cut from fruit trees cleanly with a fine
saw, rubbed with a rag soaked in pink
solution of pot. permang. The living
layer should then be smoothed against
the wood with a sharp knife. Cover the
whole with a thick coating of grafting
wax. As a last precaution, the whole
break can be painted with Bordeaux
paste.
“A.C.8.”: Every farmer keeping bees
should have one observation hive to
check the others. In an ordinary hive
cut a window back and front and let in
an oblong of glass. Over this swing a
small covering wood shutter, which can
be let down when not using windows for
observation. The bees will take no notice
of the glass if in position when they are
put in the hive.
“F.A.R.”: Horses broken to the bridle
or “open blinds” will seldom bolt, even
if they are inclined to be flighty. Bolters
have usually had a fright at some time
and their “wildness” is due to their imag-
ining danger behind, which the winkers
prevent them from seeing. After chang-
ing from winkers to “open blinds” the
horse is liable to be restless for a day
or two, but soon settles down.
“Tenrag”: To clear fowls of lice,
dip each bird in 3gal. of warm water
with loz. carbolic acid added. Dip head
and heels (on a sunny day), hold for a
minute to drain and then let loose. A
thorough kerosene spray (don’t forget
the crevices) every day for a week or two
will clear houses and perches.
“Timothy Gibbs”: Prohibit the use of
rams except from registered studs and
the quality of merino wool would be im-
proved. The N.S.W. Department of Agri-
culture provides registered rams on terms,
free classing of ewes if desired and wool-
classing instruction at dirt-cheap rates.
The only thing that it does not provide
is an army of inspectors to travel round
and find out why Bill Muddle consistently
gets a bad price for his wool. If a
broker gives a client a candid report on
the wool, the client may be annoyed and
go elsewhere with his next clip ; but if
it were possible for an independent expert
to report on the classing and quality of
each low-grade clip and make suggestions
it might be another story.

Would taking a Sydney Technical College
correspondence course of steam engineering
entitle me to an ordinary N.S.W. enginedriver’s
certificate ? If not, when and where are exam-
inations held ? —7084.
The Sydney Technical College is unable to
provide instruction in engine-driving by corres-
pondence. The Mines Department conducts an
examination by means of which men can qualify
for an ordinary engine-driver’s certificate in
February, May, September and November each
year. To sit for examination the candidate
must be at least 19 years of age, and must have
had one year’s experience in driving or firing
on a steam plant. Men who have this experi-
ence can usually prepare for the exam, by
attending classes at the college two evenings a
week over one college term (12 weeks). If a
man had his days free, and could attend full
time, he could complete the course in about
four weeks.

bourne Cup ? (5) Weight carried by Phar Lap
when he failed to win the Melbourne Cup ?
7075.
(1) lOst. 101 b. (2) Phar Lap. (3) lOst. (4)
lOst. (5) 7st. 61b. and 10s. 101 b. Several horses
were handicapped to carry more than lOst. 101 b.
(Carbine, for instance, lOst. 121 b.), but they did
not start.
(1) How can 1 change a 12 -volt car generator
into a rotary converter ? (2) Where can 1 get
the work done ? (3) Value of AC voltage ?
7166.
(1) The armature will have to be rewound and
a pair of sliprings fitted on the shaft and con-
nected to tappings on the armature winding.
In addition brushholders will have to be fixed
at suitable positions so that the brushes bear
on the sliprings. Whether it will be practicable
to carry out this work will depend upon the
design of the generator. (2) Try Machining and
Electric Co., 29{ Oxford-street, Sydney, sub-
mitting full particulars of generator and make.
(3) The voltage at the sliprings must not exceed
8.4 volts RMS.
Length of longest snake on record ? —6797.
The regal python ( Python reticulatus ) and
the anaconda ( Eunectes murinus ) have both
been recorded up to a length of 30 feet.
What are the correct wines to serve with the
courses of a dinner ? —7258.
With hors d’ceuvres, a dry sherry, previously
cooled a little; with soup, a fruity sherry or
madeira; with fish, a cold hock, chablis or
sauterne; with red meat or dark game, serve
claret or burgundy at the temperature of the
dining-room; with white-fleshed poultry, spark-
ling wines, ice-cold, can be served; with dessert,
serve port—a vintage wine carefully decanted;
with coffee, an old liqueur brandy in a large
glass.
What is the authentic history of Ingleside
powder-works, near Sydney ? There is a legend
that it was a German concern, intended to play
a part in an attack on Australia. —6954.
The stone building, Ingleside House, at Nar-
rabeen, commonly known as “the powder-
works,” was erected in 1884 by Carl von
Bieren, an American-born chemist. He pro-
posed to manufacture dynamite, but the Gov-
ernment prohibited him from doing so. He
decided to manufacture gunpowder, and floated
a company, retaining one-third of the shares.
The enterprise fell into financial difficul-
ties at the outset, the plant was not completed
and not an ounce of gunpowder was made in
the works. There is not a shred of evidence
that Von Bieren was implicated in a plot hostile
to Australia.
What is the cause of the sun setting in the
south-west in summer in Sydney, when it is
never directly overhead south of the zone of
Capricorn ? —7114.
Irrespective of latitude the terrestrial equator
intersects the horizon at the true east and west
points. Hence at the spring equinox, when
the sun is on the equator, it sets due west. As
soon as it comes south of the equator it com-
mences to set to the southward, a movement
that reaches its maximum at the summer solstice
(at Sydney 28° 38' south of west).
Are the distinctive noises made by animals,
such as the roar of the lion, the neigh of the
horse and the calls of birds, instinctive, or
are they acquired ? —7272.
As regards four-footed animals there can be
little doubt that the cries are instinctive. A
kitten or a pup that has never known a mother,
or been in the society of his kind, mews or
barks, as the case may be, by instinct. As to
birds, there is evidence (not very well authenti-
cated) from people who have made musical
notations of their calls that the mother bird
tutors the young ones.
It is thought desirable to form a co. in N. S.
Wales to take over family property consisting
of a farm and a guest house. Only members
of family would be shareholders. Property is
valued at about £3OOO. Would a co. with a
capital of, say, £lOOO, be within the law, and
which form would be most desirable, limited or
proprietary? What is the cost of registration,
etc. ? —7268.
A proprietary co., such as may be formed in
Vic., would be the most appropriate, but there
is no similar provision in N. S. Wales. You
would have to form a limited liability co. con-
sisting of not less than seven persons; six
could hold a share each and the seventh the
balance; the liability could be limited to the
amount (if any) unpaid on the shares. Thele
is no limitation as to capital; it may be any
amount. Cannot estimate cost of registration,
which would depend on circumstances.
Is Jim Flynn, the only man to knock out
Dempsey, still living? If so, how old is he?
Had he many fights, and was Dan Flynn, here
with Sam Langford about 21 years ago, a
brother? —7331.
Flynn is still alive, and was heard of last
month as comedian for a burlesque company
showing at a San Diego (Cal.) theatre. He
was born at Hoboken, N.J., on December 24,
1879. Flynn had approximately 115 fights, in-
cluding a six-round knockout over Bill Squires
in Bakersfield (Cal.) on December 20, 1907.
Dan Flynn, of Boston, is no relation.
(1) Would two Australians have any diffi-
culty in getting into South Africa ? (2) Would
£75 in Australian money be enough to pay for
a cheap passage there and leave sufficient to
get into the country ? (3) Would there be any
probability of two men being able to work a
passage on a cargo boat ? (4) What oppor-
tunities are there in S. Africa for work on
sheep or cattle runs ? (5) Which language is
generally used in the southern provinces—Eng-
lish or Dutch ? —7051.
(1) Anyone desiring to enter the Union is te-
quired to produce a guarantee of employment
or a suitable guarantee by a resident. Failing
this, the authorities stipulate possession of at
least £75 in South African currency on landing.
In all cases it is necessary for the shipping
company to have satisfactory evidence of any
of these requirements before finalising the
passage. (2) The minimum third-class fare
to Durban or Capetown is £2l, cabin-class
£47 and first-class £62. All passage money paid
in Australia is subject to exchange at the bank
rate current at the time of payment, the present
rate being 25 p.c. (3) Hardly any chance. (4)
Possibilities in this direction are not at all
bright as South Africa is endeavoring to absorb
its own unemployed. (5) Both English and
Dutch are officially recognised in all S. African
provinces.
What make of motors is installed in the aero-
plane Southern Cross ? —6797.
Wright “Whirlwind,” J 5.
Particulars of the Balfour note on war debts ?
—6867.
On August 1, 1922, Lord Balfour, as British
Secretary for Foreign Affairs, outlined Britain’s
position in regard to reparations and war debts
as follows: “The policy favored by His
Majesty’s Government is that of surrendering
their share of German reparations, and writing
off, through one great transaction, the whole
body of inter-Allied indebtedness. But, if this
be found impossible of accomplishment, we
wish it to be understood that we do not in any
event desire to make a profit out of any less
satisfactory arrangement. In no circumstances
do we propose to ask more from our debtors
than is necessary to pay to our creditors.”
(1) What are the advantages of hollow spars
in sailing-boats? My boat — a 24 ft. deep keel
cruiser—has a solid mast of Oregon and I have
been offered very cheaply a hollow mast of
identical dimensions. I don’t race the boat.
(2) What is the best all-round timber for spars
for such a boat as mine ? —7316.
(1) Lightness is the only reason for their use;
advantageous only for racing. Stick to your
solid spar. Hollow spars often need so much
staying that the ship weighs more than if solid
spars were used. (2) Clean selected Oregon.
I have a sound, serviceable motor vessel, 32
feet overall and with 11 feet beam, which is
used entirely as a work boat. She is decked
over except for an open cockpit aft, has a
coachhouse and carries a modified, auxiliary
yawl rig. Being of shallow draught she will not
sail to windward even when equipped with a
larger suit of sails. Is there any way of over-
coming this, as I want to sail her ? I cant
fit a keel; I work in shallow water. —7320.
Get the advice of a boatbuilder as to the best
position in which to fit a centreboard. A long,
deep board would probably suit you best.
If constructional difficulties preclude the use
of a centreboard you may fit leeboards made
of hardwood and iron-bound. Most textbooks
on small-boat sailing contain directions how to
use them.
Procedure necessary to regain a horse which
the police are holding ? —7209.
Find out from the officer in charge why the
horse is held. The police have power in cer-
tain cases to detain animals pending proceed-
ings or as security against penalties.
Description of the bird-catching spider ?
7198.
It is a denizen of the tropics and belongs
to the genus Mygale. When stretched out, it
takes up a space from six to nine inches across,
the body being about two inches in diameter.
It lives in trees, or in hollows under rocks,
and there spins a curiously-shaped web or nest.
It goes out at night to hunt for its food of
insects and, as is alleged, to ensnare young
birds.
How is commercial acetic acid made? —7192.
By the dry distillation of wood in iron
retorts at low temperature. The products of
the distillation are gases, an aqueous liquid,
and tar. The liquid contains acetic acid mixed
with methyl alcohol, acetone and other impuri-
ties. It is treated with quicklime, which causes
the acetic acid to be converted into calcium
acetate. This solution is then evaporated, the
tarry products being skimmed off. The acetate
is then distilled with concentrated hydrochloric
acid and the acetic acid is separated. It is
mixed with potassium permanganate to oxidise
impurities and distilled once more, after which
the product is sufficiently pure for commercial
purposes.

/ am a pianoforte student in exile on a
cable station for three years. / brought with
me a tremendous stock of classical music, and
I’m ploughing through it. I can’t make head
or tail of some of the stuff, though l can
play the notes at sight. (1) Can you suggest
any way in which 1 can improve my technique ?
(2) If I can play the top clef but not the lower
one, is there any reason why I shouldn’t im-
provise a bass of my own ? —7201.
(1) If you can play the notes at sight you
don’t need much aid in technique, but, never-
theless, you’ll find a daily drill in all the major
and minor scales immensely helpful. As to
phrasing, you can get gramophone records of
almost everything worth while in piano litera-
ture. (2) None at all, if it enables you to
maintain the rhythm. But when you have
mastered the outline, it would pay you to give
undivided attention to that bottom clef. As
Chopin said, in reference to rubato, “the left
hand is the conductor.”
(1) What was the position in his day of Wil-
liam Etty, the painter ? (2) When was the often
mentioned “Etty letter” written, and to whom ?
And what were the contents ? —7187.
(1) He was one of the leading figure painters
of his generation. (2) In 1828, to his brother
Walter Etty, of Lombard-street, London, on
the occasion of William being elected an R.A.
and defeating John Constable the landscape
painter. It was as follows: “This is to inform
you that your good ship the William Etty
arrived and came to anchor in the bay to-night
at half-past ten; after beating about for so
many years in the Arte (not Arctic) ocean.
After being nearly wrecked on the coast of
Italy we put in to Venice and were there well
caulked with Venice Turpentine. After com-
bating many gales from Cape Difficulty, and
being nearly upset on Rejection Rock, on
nearing land a Constable got on board some
of the Royal ships, and came out with five
or six guns (swivels). But a broadside of
eighteen long forties sent him to the bottom.”
(1) Most prevalent faults found in receiver
power transformers ? (2) How to trace an
open circuit in one of the windings? —7l69.
(1) The windings may be open-circuited,
short-circuited on each other or across their
own ends, or grounded to the transformer
case. Loose laminations also cause trouble.
(2) Transformers may be tested with a dry
cell and a low-reading voltmeter. The posi-
tive side of the cell is connected to the posi-
tive voltmeter terminal, the ends of two lengths
of wire being joined to the remaining cell and
meter terminals. The other ends of these wires
are bared, and the transformer is tested by
applying them successively across both wind-
ings and between windings and core. No
reading in the first test indicates an open cir-
cuit in the winding, while a reading in the
second indicates that the winding is shorted to
the core or case.
What are the agglutinative languages ? —6964.
Those which have long compound words,
consisting of the principal word and the quali-
fying words; distinct from the “inflectional”
languages. The principal agglutinative lan-
guages are the Mongolian, Turkish, Finnish,
Hungarian, North American and the Dravidian
(Tamil and Telugu, etc.) in Southern India.
(1) When was Matisse, the painter, born ?
(2) Is he still alive ? (3) What is his particular
brand of art ? —7348.
(1) In 1869. (2) Yes. (3) He paints in masses
of flat color, and suggests distance by juxta-
position of color. He is mainly concerned
with pattern and uses his shapes to form a
decoration without any attempt toward realism.
One of the fathers of the so-called “modern”
school.
What is the difference between a two- and
three-dimensional painting ? —7333.
Two-dimensional paintings are those which
express nothing save a flat pattern such a 9 the
old Byzantine painters made, and the Floren-
tines before a.d. 1300. After Giotto, shading
was introduced to give roundness to the figures
and distance, and perspective was used in land-
scapes. The more realistic style is sometimes
termed three-dimensional as a convenient
method of distinguishing it from the earlier
method.
(1) What is the force of gravity in feet per
second, per second ? (2) Do all the planets
revolve round the sun as does the earth ? (3)
If so, how long do they take to make a com-
plete revolution round the sun ? (4) Do all the
planets move in the same plane? —7l6o.
(1) 32.2 feet or 980 cm. (2) All the planets
revolve in elliptic orbits round the sun, and
in the same direction of rotation. (3) Mer-
cury, 88 days; Venus, 225; Earth, 365; Mars,
687; Jupiter, 4333; Saturn, 10,759; Uranus,
30,688, and Neptune, 60,181. (4) No two
planets move in exactly the same plane, though,
as a general rule, the planes of the larger
planets coincide with that of the earth’s ecliptic.
(1) What are the proportions of colors re-
quired for ordinary paints (by weights ) ? (2)
Proportions of oil and turps to dry paint ?
7322.
(1) White, white lead 100 parts; black, lamp
black 100 parts; green, white lead 25, verdigris
75 parts; stone, white lead 99, burnt umber
1 part; lead-color, white lead 98, lamp black
2 parts; red, red lead 50, red ochre 50 parts;
chocolate, lamp black 4, Spanish brown 96
parts. (2) Six pints raw linseed oil, 1 pint
boiled oil, 1 pint turps, 12 to 141 b. dry paint.

James Nash, a lone Prospector, in 1867, discovered gold in the gullies of Gympie. In a span of 60 years this
famous field produced from the reefs 4,084,720 ounces of gold to the fabulous value of
£14,296,320
OBJECTS.
The Company is being formed with the object of acquiring from the Vendor Syndicate
hereinafter mentioned the property known as Gold Mining Lease 1650 situated in the
Mining Warden’s District of Gympie containing an area of 50 acres, and thoroughly
testing this area in order to locate the gold bearing strata which it is confidently believed
by experts do actually exist, as indicated by the reports included in this Prospectus. This
lease is known as the Lucknow fine of reef, and includes the shaft partly sunk by the Great
Northern Extended Company. The bore hole put down by the Queensland Government in
1923 is also on the property. The map included in the prospectus indicates definitely the
exact location of the Company’s lease it is proposed to work and its proximity to well-known
mining companies who worked the Myall, Sultan, Little Sultan, Brickfield, Lucknow and
Beehive line of reef.
Also other objects as set out in the Company’s Memorandum of Association.
PROPERTY.
The Leasehold proposed to be acquired by the Northern Gympie Goldfields, Ltd., has
50 acres in the area which was closed against mining after the Government sunk a bore
hole for investigation purposes in 1923. The Lease herein referred to will be the first issued
on the area which is officially described by the Queensland Mines Department as the Neglected
Portion of the Gympie Goldfields.
The Vendor Syndicate in acquiring this property has spent a great deal of time and
incurred expense in research work and in collecting the necessary data to justify the formation
of a Company and will transfer the Whole of their right, title and interest in the lease to
Northern Gympie Goldfields, Limited, for 20,000 deferred Ordinary Shares subject to paragraph
5 on page 15 of the prospectus.
The Deferred Ordinary Shareholders will not rank for dividends in the first year that
the Company declares a Dividend until the holders of Ordinary Shares have received a
Dividend of 10 per cent, for that year. After the Ordinary Shareholders have received 10 per

CONCISE INFORMATION.
There are no promoters’ shares nor other consideration.
The vendors get no cash. They show their confidence by taking only shares, and deferred
shares at that. ' ’
Every member of the vendor syndicate will be a subscriber for contributing shares in the
Company.
Directors and Management are all practical men with wide experience.
The lease to be acquired by the Company is large enough to offer ample scope for handsome
returns if the reefs which are expected to be located are met with.
Technical and practical men, as shown by their reports, consider that the striking of these
reefs at depth is practically certain.
JAMES BROWN, Manager of the 4 North Phoenix'Mine for 43 years, writes: —
“I believe the Northern part of the Gympie Goldfield a very good prospect for gold.
The reefs and the country are much the same as we have had our great gold from
in the past. I think the shows for gold in the North are just as good as in the
South.”
MALCOLM WADDELL, Manager of Columbia and Smithfield Mines for 20 years:—
“No doubt the same bed of slate exists as was worked to the South of the
Fault with good results. The Great Northern Mine proved the slate to be gold
producing. The Bore Hole proves that the country continues to the East. To all
appearances the Company’s Lease covers the probable continuation of all the
well-known reefs in the locality, including Myall, Sultan, Little Sultan, Brickfield,
Lucknow and Beehive. I have not the slightest hesitation in recommending it to
the investing public.”
Gympie officials of the present Company have requested that 20,000 shares be made available
for local subscription.
Originals _of all reports contained in the prospectus are available for inspection at the

GEOLOGICAL SURVEY REPORT.
GREAT NORTHERN AREA, GYMPIE.
By J. H. REID, A.S.T.C.,
Senior Government Geologist, Queensland.
(:Queensland Mining Journal, 16/6/’33.)
An area which, on direct geological evidence as well as collateral
mining data, is apparently the most likely to inaugurate any serious
revival of gold mining on the Gympie Goldfield,
In connection with this area, apparently the mosc likely, on direct geological evidence as
well as collateral mining data, to inaugurate any serious revival of gold-mining on the
Gympie goldfield, a large amount of geological work has been done in past years by officers
of the Queensland Geological Survey. I have studied the published reports and maps of the
area as well as the results of the most recent work carried out (in 1922-23), viz., the MS.
maps and office memoranda of the Chief Geologist, Mr. L. C. Ball, of which only a short
advance report has been published. It would appear, on considering the record of this
work and after briefly inspecting portion of the down-faulted Great Northern area, that no
other geologist, without undertaking much intensive fieldwork, would be in a position to
add to the advance report by Mr. Ball entitled “A Neglected Section of the Gympie
Goldfield ’ (see Q.G.M.J., Jan., 1923), other than by a general summary of all the records
and a statement of the conclusions to be derived therefrom.
At the risk of some redundancy but with the view of reaffirming statements of the
probable economic aspect of this neglected area, as well as emphasising the apparent
consensus of geological opinion thereon, it may be considered very desirable to attempt to
summarise the case for mining investigation within it as follows:
For the better understanding of the stratigraphical information used in this summary
it may be said that the general section in descending order (after Rands) is:
Limestone group
Conglomerate group
“ PhoeniSlates”
Sandstones, etc.
“First Bed of Slate”
Greywackes, etc. ..
‘‘Second Bed of Slate” .
“Gympie Greenstone,” etc
‘Third Bed of Slate”
Section about 1300 ft. thick.
The beds indicated by italics are those within which reefs, in association with plumbago
floors and breaks, have proved notably auriferous.
In 1889 Mr. W. H. Rands made the following statement regarding the Two Mile — i.e.,
the major fault-block immediately. to the north of the Great Northern area:
“A very cursory glance is sufficient to show that we are dealing with very similar beds:
while a closer examination... shows that the order, of superposition of the principal
beds is the same in both places, and that the strata of the Two Mile are an actual
continuation of the Gympie beds.”
This meant that if any of the productive or higher associated beds were found at the
surface in, the intervening area, now known as the Great Northern, it was a practical
geological certainty that the Phoenix shales and other productive beds occurred beneath them.
This was to be definitely inferred from the subsequent mapping of Mr. B. Dunstan (late
Chief Geologist) and staff in the Gympie Geological Map published in 1911 but without
explanatory text or sections. Their mapping of the upper limestone on this area showed the
absolute presumption that the productive sequence lay at shallow depth below the surface
over a considerable area between the Lady Mary and the Peter and Paul crosscourses.
In 1922, the then Deputy Chief Geologist, Mr. L. C. Ball (now Chief Government
Geologist), carried out further fieldwork on this area, and as a consequence one drillhole
was carried out by diamond drilling with the object of definitely proving the existence of the
plumbago-bearing productive slates of the highly auriferous belt of Gympie. Previous to the
drilling, and in the article mentioned above, he stated: —
“I think it quite possible, and even likely, that this corner of the Gympie Goldfield
may yet prove as wealth productive as any of the deeper ground to the southwards.”
During 1923, as a result of advice given by Mr. Ball, a Government drill operated on a
site adjacent to the Great Northern Extended shaft, and Mr. Ball, in several official memoranda,
gave details of the drill section from which the following particulars are abstracted:
Depth.
Base of Upper Gympie Shales .. .. .. .-. .. 227 ft.
Limestone group .. .. .. .. 227-477 ft.
Conglomerate group (upper limit) .... .. 477 ft.
Drilling ceased at a depth of 934 ft. and plumbago floors were passed through at 500 ft.,
522 ft., 635 ft., 687 ft. and 759 ft., in addition to which dark shales from the lower part of the
drillhole were of distinct promise.
This bore proved, in general, the normal sequence of, at least, a considerable proportion,
of the productive beds and those immediately overlying, which occur in both areas to the
north and south of the Great Northern fault-block.
Mr. Ball’s MS. maps of the area indicate his view of a greater extension of the line of the
Lady Mary crosscourse to the south-west than is shown in the last published geological map
of Gympie. He also showed that the reversal of dips to the westwards had affected some
arching or doming within the down-faulted block which can be taken to account for the
failure of the productive beds to outcrop as in the neighboring fault-blocks. From these data
combined, a greater extent of buried beds of the productive series than was thought to be
possible from an interpretation of the published official map is a direct implication.
In attempting after a lapse of years to seek reasons why this portion of the field was
comparatively neglected, several may have application, but one simple explanation is that
the productive beds outcropped at the surface in regular sequence on both sides of the
Great Northern fault-block, and the presence of auriferous reefs-beneath was thus betrayed
to the early miners by the precious metal shed there from outcrops. Such an occurrence of
surface gold was not to be expected in the area in qustion,, for, besides being relatively
down-faulted, the productive beds were slightly domed and on this account the plumbago
breaks, etc., do not outcrop, and hence no easily-won gold was available for the miners at
the surface or at shallow depths. Thus may be explained the blankness of the area from the
miner’s point of view during the early days.
The .true position must have been seized to some extent in subsequent years, as operations
were carried out in both the Great Northern and Great Western mines to depths of some
hundreds of feet. The Great Northern proved the presence and the auriferous character of
the reefs within the productive series, but, unfortunately, both mine shafts were placed in too
close proximity to the Lady Mary crosscourse and the fullest exploration of these was rendered
too costly, and in regard to some beds, impossible, owing to the shafts passing through the
croscourse into unproductive beds to the south of it.
The subsequent neglect may be considered in connection with Mr. Ball’s statement (Ann.
Report, Mines Dept., 1923) that if the data derived from the Government drillhole had been
available before the collapse of the mining industry on the field, capital for the sinking of a
shaft in this section would have been readily subscribed.
The recorded production of the Great Northern (34930 z. bullion from 3040 tons ore)
shows that reefs may occur in this neglected area and that they may be notably auriferous
within the buried productive beds.
The productive beds lie buried at shallow depths' in this down-faulted area, and an absence
of sufficient intersecting quartz reefs and leaders in them would seem to be the only
speculative risk in thoroughly testing the area. It cannot be assumed on the comparative
absence of noticeable quartz-reef outcrops at the surface that such an insufficiency exists, for,
in addition to a small number of reef outcrops mapped by Mr. B. Dunstan and staff, the
Great Northern is reported to have located several reefs, and Mr. Ball reported in the cores
of the Great Northern Extended drillhole the occurrence of numerous quartz-bearing forma-
tions. It can be considered as certain, also, that the known reefs to the immediate south that
were dislocated at a later period by the faulting on the Lady Mary crosscourse must in some
cases continue unknown distances into the fault-block. A number of these were greatly
productive of gold on the south side of the crosscourse.
As Mr. Ball has emphasised on several occasions the presence of graphitic shales and
plumbago floors is a prerequisite for the occurrence of gold in the reefs of Gympie, while the
second requisite is the intersection with them of quartz leaders and reefs.
Both requisite conditions have been positively proved to occur within the area discussed,
and if sufficient financial resources can be provided to give this combination of conditions an
effective test by sinking to the productive beds and exploring them with thoroughness for
their intersections with reefs and leaders, it would seem that payable production of gold might
be looked forward to with some show of confidence

NOTIONS
Under the Whip
Despite the smallness of the field there
was plenty of excitement about the Aus-
tralian Hurdle Race at Caulfield. Poidale
would have started at cramped odds if
he had not met with a training mishap
early in the week. He twisted a plate
while schooling, and on the Wednesday
could not put the injured leg on the
ground. Poidale is in the stable that
formerly sheltered Phar Lap. Fomenta-
tions were applied by Telford, at whose
urgent request P. Grant Hay, owner of
the horse, hurried back from Tasmania.
On Friday morning Poidale, having im-
proved to a marked extent, was given a
trial and pulled up all right.
The fact of the Poitrel gelding being
sent to the post on Saturday ought to
have assured backers that he was 0.K.,
but they allowed him to drift to 6 to 1.
Poidale romped home a dozen lengths in
advance of the plodding Sub Rosa, who
defeated the former Sydney performer
Lady Doris by a length for second. The
hooting of the winner by a large section
of the crowd was unwarranted. Grant
Hay called in at the press-room and in-
"We'Ll toss for ends,
ROUGiH or smooth ? "
Bert : " .*
Giert : " smooth
Bert; " 1 win, Qert. itwm
RouCiH "
formed assembled sporting writers that
he had not put a shilling on his horse.
Remarkable that the Grand National
Hurdle and Australian Hurdle this year
should each have been won by a son of
Poitrel. That stallion is achieving post-
humous fame as a sire of jumpers. Belar
led all the way in the Grand National,
but L. J. Hynes, on Poidale, was content
for Phocis to make the pace for two-
thirds of the journey at Caulfield. As
Phocis was conceding over 2st. to Poi-
dale—list. 101 b. as against 9st. 71b. —-
it is small wonder that he had no fight
left in him when challenged.
Poidale ran the 3| miles and 20 yards
in 6min. 7sec. The race record (6min.
sisec.) was established by Sir Alogy in
1928, when the track was in ideal trim.
Heavy rain during the week had made
the turf soft on Saturday. This accounted
for Zygon falling on the flat some dis-
tance beyond the last hurdle. Poidale
won quite as easily as Sir Alogy had
done, though the latter led from start
to finish. Phocis is perhaps the most
brilliant hurdler in Victoria, but he does
not stay.
From a galloping standpoint the most
noteworthy happening on Saturday was
the success of Waltzing Lily in the Mala-
koff Stakes. It was the first occasion on
which the Newmarket Handicap winner
had been tried over a middle distance,
and she squeezed home by a head from
Segati, with Spearman an impressive
third. Waltzing Lily had the substantial
burden of 9st. 101 b., and conceded Segati
(another four-year-old mare) 311 b. Spoils
should have gone to Segati, who met with
interference in the straight, but the Caul-
field Cup candidature of Waltzing Lily
will have to be regarded with respect.
Darby Munro paid a hurried visit to
Melbourne to ride Casque d’Or in the
Moondah Plate, and the Rossendale geld-
ing, who is owned in Sydney by Mrs.
W. M.. Gollan, went out a warm favo-
rite. He looked to have an excellent
chance coming to the turn, but was in-
volved in a scrimmage which resulted in
three horses falling. In front all the
way, Ogwell, a Devonshire three-year-
old, won by half a length from Kaoota,
with Good Hunting third.
The Australian Steeplechase will be
contested next Saturday. There is likely
to be a weak field, both in numbers and
quality. Despite his 12st. 131 b., Red-
ditch ought to win. The chief danger
may be Mosstrooper, who has recovered
some of his old form and receives 161 b.
from the G.N. hero.
Vista has been supported in Epsom-
Metrop. doubles with his stablemate
Milantheon, and the bookmakers took no
risks with the little fellow in the Den-
ham Court Handicap at Warwick Farm.
He closed at evens, and won so easily
in fast time (lmin. 12isec.) as to draw
attention to his Epsom chance with 7st.
91b. As he is a Randwick winner up
to seven furlongs, there is no reason
why he should not run out a mile.
A.J.C. committeeman Walter Brunton
was the Recipient of many handshakes
after the grey colt Roxburgh took the
Maiden Three-year-old.. By Pantheon
from Chrystal, Roxburgh has speed and
stamina on both sides of his pedigree.
The colt went out favorite at 9 to 4, after
fours had been laid, and carried his
9st. in fine style.
Ranchero was in a sour mood in the
August Handicap. He had performed
well at the recent Grafton Cup meeting,
and Randwick trainer Price informed all
and sundry that he was very fit. It must
have been one of Ranchero’s off days ;
he never flattered his backers. Tailed off
most of the way, he moved up at
the turn, and beat home a few tired
horses to gain the minor placing, behind
Magnetic and Bill Wedgewood. Mag-
netic (3 to 1) was ri,dden a nice race
by the apprentice Harvey, who rides the
Rossendale gelding in most of his work.
J. T. Jamieson is in luck’s way. He
won two races with Koda Pen last week,
and at the Farm he continued the good
work with Persian (9 to 2) in the Eden-
sor Park Handicap. Persian has 7st. 71b.
in the Epsom, and has come into the
market. He is a brilliant horse, and the
real type to win an Epsom.

Rosehill trainer W. A. Ross, who won
a Sydney Cup with Gwillian G, landed
a double with King’s Prize and Samovar.
The former won the Trial Brush Hurdle
at fives, while Samovar romped home in
the Farm Novice at eights. It was a
really good performance on the part of
Samovar, who should win more races
up to ten furlongs. The favorite, Opera
Pie, was second-last most of the way,
and did well to run second.

Lady Linden’s brilliant gallop in the
Ascot Handicap at Brisbane on Saturday
suggests that she is right back to her
fine form of autumn last year, when she
won the Newmarket. Her jockey, Tan-
wan, was kicked at the post by Sun
Eagle and had to be carried back in the
ambulance, Sinclair being substituted;
but it made no difference, except to the
price, which lengthened from threes to
fours. Second-last part of the way, the
mare came through remarkably in
the straight and got the best of a close
finish with Autumn Wind and Some Care
(eights the pair) running six in lmin.
12+sec. Previously Tanwan had steered
Lough Neagh (9 to 4 on) to an easy
victory in the National Plate.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Accidents will happen, even in wrest-
ling. Duke Ritchins, a massive person
from the U.S.A., was matched with
Lurich at Leichhardt. Somehow he
gained a fall with a body-scissors in the
third round. Lurich, who had seemed
to be suffering from lethargy or some-
thing, was all business in the fifth. He
put such pressure into a body-scissors as
to squeeze the wind out of the moun-
tain of meat. Ritchins could not con-
tinue, and thus the crowd was deprived
of the familiar sixth round.

The Australian National Football
Carnival opened at Sydney Cricket
Ground last week. Victoria won the
first match from N.S.W. 23-17 (155)
to 14-18 (102), showing all-round superior-
ity. In the second game a rare struggle
between Westralia and South Australia
saw the latter get home by 13-17 to 10-24,
or 95 to 84.
......
Tasmania made its appearance on the
second day with a smashing win over
the infant Canberra side, final scores
being 31-29 (215) to 12-5 (77). Queens-
land-N.S.W. match was more interesting.
though here again there was a wide mar-
gin between the teams at the finish,
N.S.W. winning 19-22 (136) to 6-15 (51).
......
Saturday’s programme drew a big
crowd After Tasmania had beaten
Queensland 21-11 (137) to 7-14 (56) the
Victorians and Westralians had a thrill-
ing set-to. The Westralians found their
feet sooner than the opposition and,
handling much better, especially in the
mark j ng> ] e( i 4.4 t o 1-4 at the first
quarter. The men from Victoria, unwind-
ing their combination, were close behind
a t half-time, scores being W.A. 6-6, Vic.
5-10. The third quarter saw Westralia
still in the lead, with the Victorians
asserting themselves ; and each side added
26 points, Westralia having 10-10 (70) on
the board to 9-12 (66). The final quarter
provided far the best football of the
match, with the Victorians gradually
wearing down the opposition. Gordon
Coventry, who had been patchy in front
of goal, developed sticky fingers and,
marking splendidly, piled on a couple
of goals for his side when they were
needed. The Westralians rallied gamely,
but Victoria ran out winners by
15 points, final scores being Victoria
14-16 (100)., Westralia 12-13 (85).
After another grand game Victoria
beat South Australia on Monday by
19-14 (128) to 17-11 (113), so it will
bear away the honors of the tourney.

The absence at the Sydney carnival of
leading Vic. League players made less
difference to Melbourne week-end gates
than the fact that none of the matches mat-
tered much. Collingwood, playing a fast,
determined game, caught Richmond in a
lackadaisical mood, and finished with
106 points to 68. The defeat still leaves
the Tigers level with Geelong in first
place. Geelong scored 100 to North
Melbourne’s 61 ; South Melbourne 93 to
St. Kilda’s 67, and Footscray 110 to Haw-
thorn’s 72. Fitzroy, in fourth place with
a bare half-game lead, got the shivers
when Melbourne collared a four-goal
lead in the third quarter. A vigorous
effort in the last term saved ’Roy’s bacon,
and it got home with 86 points to 69.
Carlton outed Essendon with 106 to 63.

28 miles per gallon ... and ahead
of its class in everything but Price!
Read what a leading Motor Editor
said of the Master Chevrolet Six ...
“Big car with small thirst”
“The test was divided roughly into half—
the first being a tour through mountainous
country, and the second consisting solely
of short city running with stops every
mile or two.
“In both the Chevrolet scored, the
long distance touring consumption
being 28 miles a gallon, and the city
running 23.
“Apart from the silence and power of the
engine, the three outstanding features of
the Chevrolet were its comfort, powerful
braking and fool-proof synchro-mesh gear
change, second gear being not just ‘near
silent,’ but absolutely as silent as top.”
“Performance worthy of a car
costing at least £lOO more”
“Performance was worthy of a car costing
at least£loo more, and the glittering body-
work and soft deep upholstery did not
look as if they belonged to one of the
cheapest cars on the market.
. . Mt. Dandenong from Bayswater is a
little-known scenic route, and the severest
testing road around Melbourne.
“It is a low-gear climb for many cars, but
the Chevrolet did most of the trip in top,
second gear being used not because the
engine would not pull the car, but because
I did not like to rush the car across ruts
from 6 inches to 2 feet deep.”
“No point to criticise”
“In everything except its price, the 1933
Chevrolet Six convincingly showed in the
200 miles road test that it has stepped
out of its class.
“Steering was heavily reduced for light-
ness, but lacked nothing in accuracy, had
no trace of a wobble in it, and added con-
siderably to the ease with which the car
could be handled in’traffic. In any of the
city streets the lock was sufficient for a
clean full turn about.
“No point of importance could be found
for criticism, and with its 73 m.p.h. as
maximum, and 4 m.p.h. as minimum in
top gear, the new Chevrolet is a notable
addition to the magnificent cars of 1933.”
And these are all FACTS —not fantastic fig
ures
Every word of the above paragraph is from the official report
of the Motor Editor of a leading Australian daily paper.
He is an authority ... he was disinterested . . . and his job
was to test the car and write about what he found, good or
bad. And it is significant that his report is a glowing tribute
to the Master Chevrolet from beginning to end ; it is loaded
with facts and figures which are irrefutable and not the
fantastic outpourings of an over-enthusiastic dealer.
This report sets out, in plain terms, the deep satisfaction
that every owner of a Master Chevrolet feels for his car. Its
combination of luxury and low price, performance and
economy, comfort and beauty is not paralleled by any other
car in its class. If you set any store by proven facts and
figures ... if you consider value as an important factor in
your buying, you must see Chevrolet before you commit
yourself to the purchase of any other car.

“Birkenhead Park”: Not only do Mel-
bourne journals err in their estimates of
Rugby football (B. 2/8/’33). The Syd-
ney “Herald” recently published a letter
combating a statement that the playing
of Rugby by schoolboys had a strong
influence on character formation. The
correspondent stated that the English
Public Schools, “the pattern of boys’
schools,” almost all have their own indi-
vidual game, Rugby being played by
comparatively few. The statement is
ludicrously untrue. Schools like Eton,
Harrow and Winchester, to name a few
of those which used to play special
games of their own, have gone over to
Rugby, which is now played by the great
majority of British schools. Even the
great Soccer-playing schools have been
affected, only a few like the Charter-
house, Shrewsbury and Westminster still
remaining loyal to the round-ball game.
* * - * *
“Off-Si’ ”: That reference to the ages
of football codes (B. 2/8/’33) recalls the
fact that all those mentioned are pups
beside that played in China 2000 years
or so ago. Even Emperors played, one
of them, Cheng (32-6 b.c.),' having re-
torted to courtiers who protested the
game was exhausting and undignified
“We like playing ; and what one chooses
to do is not exhausting.” The object of
the game was to kick the ball between two
high posts, and the captain of the losing
side was always thrashed. Here we seem
to see an analogy with Melbourne foot-
ball except that it is the referee who is
thrashed down there, whichever side
wins.

“D. Empson”: Except in Melbourne,
the Westralians are always the bar-
rackers’ favorites when they play Vic-
toria. The Sydney crowd’s partiality for
them recalled Hobart’s tremendous shouts
of “Come on, The West! ” when the lads
from the two leading Australian-football
States were contending mightily in the
winter of 1924. That match (Victoria
won it by 103 to 95) was described by
Donald Macdonald, of the “Argus,” an
excellent judge, as the finest ever played
under the national rules. If it was better
than Saturday’s tussle it must have been
great indeed.

Footbrawl
"Rover”: Though there has been much
protesting over the Victorian custom of
luring players from other States, it
has remained for secretary Allison, of
the N.S.W. body, to make a practicable
suggestion for at least minimising it. He
wants an agreement whereby a player can
only be transferred from one State to
another on payment of a substantial
fee to the club losing him, as is
the practice in English professional foot-
ball. The trouble would be enforcing
the payment. Agreements of this kind
have been broken before, and the Olym-
pic people have also found that it is one
thing to get people to sign bonds and
another to make them honor them.
* * * *
“Hooey”: Though a joint committee
of Australian and Rugby League football
enthusiasts has been appointed to con-
sider amalgamation of the two codes, the
move is only a face-saving device. The
president of the N.S.W. Rugby League
has denounced the proposal as prepos-
terous, and not only declined to sit as
a delegate to the amalgamation confer-
ence, but said some nasty things. As the
Queensland League is also giving the
show a miss and the officials on their
way to England with the Australian
League team have cabled their heartfelt
curses, all is over bar counting the profits
of the advertisement —if any.
* * * *
Leonard Stokes, whose death in Eng-
land at 78 is reported, occupied in his
time much the same position in Rugby
football as W. G. Grace did in cricket.
Very big, fast and powerful, he was the
sheet anchor of English international
teams for years, playing in the three-
quarter line from the days in which
there were only two players there. He
became a great centre when a third man
was added, and when our own Wade was
on the wing the opposition was kept busy.
Famous Blackheath was his club, and
he captained England many times.
“Stand Off”: Arrangements for the
tour of an Australian Universities Rugby
team in Japan have been completed.
The Nipponese will pay all expenses for
22 players and a manager and will re-
tain all gates. The side leaves on Decem-
ber 30 and returns on March 15, which
just about fills in the long vacation ; it
will be chosen from teams taking part in
the inter-’Varsity matches in Sydney next
week. Adelaide Uni. will be represented
for the first time in this tourney.
=l= * * *
“Widnes”: The Australian Rugby
League team now in England opens its
tour with a match against St. Helen’s
Recreation, one of the Lancashire clubs,
on August 26. The programme of 34
matches includes three Tests and three
matches dignified with the name of
“county” against Yorkshire, Lancashire,
and Cumberland. Where Cumberland
comes in it is hard to see, since it is a
Rugby Union county and the nearest
League club is at Barrow in Lancashire.
The last match on December 30 will be
against a team of Welshmen playing with
North of England clubs at Wembley.
This side has been dubbed “Wales.” All
the other games are against North of
England professional club organisations.
The Nineteenth Hole
“Cleek”: A crow story from Lithgow
(N.F.W.) has unusual features. A player
named Evans drove off, and as soon as the
hefty drive stopped a crow got away with
the pill. The ball was replaced under rule
17 (outside agency) and a mid-iron shot
played to the green, where another crow
was waiting. Rule 17 was invoked again
and a third ball put down. This time
the crows were not quick enough, and
the player managed to get a 12-inch putt
down. Par for the hole, which was thus
done in three, is four, so the crows
proved more of a help than a hindrance.
“Divot Digger”: One of Australia's
most interesting minor golf tourneys
promises to be the annual scrap for the
Gordon Shaw Cup, for which only mem-
bers of the Waratah Rugby team which
toured Britain and France under manager
Gordon Shaw in 1927-28 are eligible to
compete. The opening go over 18 holes
last week was won by forward Geoff
Storey with 89 off the stick, which his
handicap cut to 67. The trophy itself is
unique, a silver Jack Shea quartpot with
in-fitting pannikin complete.
“Hotham”: Victoria’s annual profes-
sional golfers' tourney for the Dunlop
Cup drew an entry of over 30 of the
State’s best to the Kingston Heath course.
The holder of the cup, E. Naismith. was
outed in the qualifying rounds by Horace
Boorer, the eventual winner, by 7 and 6,
from Hugh Thomson. Boorer, who won
the Victorian professional title in 1927,
gave a great display of putting. His shot
play has always been notable, but he has
also developed deadliness on the greens.
J[: %
“Hoylake”: In his book, “My Golfing
Life,” Harry Vardon tells of a caddie
whose fate it was to be assigned to a
player who always took a generous divot
with his iron shots. This meant the lad
had to walk forward to the far-flung
piece of turf and then walk back to re-
place it in the hole. In an 18-hole round
this meant a lot of extra travelling, and
SECOND: “Try and guard your mouth; you’ll want it for givin'
yer dyin’ depositions.”
the youth solved the trouble by carrying
a spare divot in his pocket and taking
the newest one on to the next dugout.
It is a bright idea, but there are some
Sydney players whose caddies would need
a motor-lorry.
Car and Cycle
“Formula”: One of the little sur-
prises of motoring is the discovery, often
made by the unaccustomed driver, that
though he has been driving for some
hours at, say, 40 m.p.h., his average rate
is somewhere nearer 30. The reason is
that almost unnoticeable periods of slow-
ing down reduce the average if they
are not offset by a considerable increase
in pace. The longer the trip, by the
way, the easier to catch up. On a run
of 100 miles, for instance, 10 minutes
will make up the difference between 70
and 80 m.p.h. With a slower average,
on the same run, the time taken to
raise the average from, say, 20 to 30
m.p.h. would be an hour and 40 minutes.
Yet to raise an average of 20 to 25
m.p.h. on a 100-mile run would take, an
hour, while a jump from 50 to 55 m.p.h.
over the same distance would call for
only 11 minutes.
“Verboten”: Australian road and
transport authorities are pretty ingenious
in digging up new ways of harassing
motorists, but they have missed one that
their Norwegian cobbers have just
thought of. This is the imposing of a
fine and imprisonment for smoking while
driving a car —drinking has been banned
for some years. The reason presumably
is that cigarette or pipe smoke may
momentarily blind a driver at a critical
moment and lead to a smash. We may
almost certainly expect to find a similar
prohibition come into force in Australia
shortly now that someone else has
thought of it.
“Kick Starter”: James Pringle, one of
the Australian representatives in the Isle
of Man Tourist Trophy races for motor-
cycles, is back in Australia, having had
the bad luck to score nothing better than
a spill in the two events he started in.
Pringle says that the famous Norton
team is anxious to visit Melbourne for
the centenary events if this can be
arranged. The team consists of S. Woods,
T. Hunt and J. Guthrie, and the trio,
singly or in combination, have been prac-
tically undefeatable in British and Euro-
pean events for several years past.
Racquet and Bawl
“Hotham” : The gates at the Davis
Cup challenge round in Paris were cal-
culated to make even the Victorian Foot-
ball League howl with envy. Booked
seats alone realised £24,000, and there
was another £5OOO or so coming from
the unreserved outer seats. The English
team got away with £BOOO as its share
of the fun in addition to the Cup. This
will go to the English L.T.A., which is
far from being hard up. Though Wim-
bledon club runs the very profitable All-
England championships, the Association
is not left out in the cold. Last year
Wimbledon cleaned up £36,000 ; the Asso-
ciation got a third. What it will get this
year in addition to the Paris money will
probably be even more, but they haven't
finished counting the money yet.
“Kooyong”: It looks as if the English
team for Australia will be completed by
the addition of Wilde, with Hughes, Lee
and Perry as the other three. Wilde is
the English junior champion, and the
tour should improve his game. Austin
can be counted out, since he is not
allowed on long tours since his marriage.
All the four Englishmen will be in
America next month for the Yankee
championships, and will, of course, meet
cur own men there. It is likely they will
come on to Australia with Crawford
and co.
“Rockferry”: Much fuss is being made
of Jack Crawford’s squareheaded tennis
racket, an idea he borrowed from Nor-
man Brookes. Where Brookes got it is
unknown, but he was certainly not the
first champion to use one, as a Mel-
bourne tennis writer has asserted. Writer
can recall a racquet of this make being
sold in the 1880’s under the style of the
“Lawford,” a player of that name who
won the All-England championship in
1887 particularly affecting it. There were
eccentricities in stringing as well as in
shapes in those days. One quite popular
make had strings interlaced to form an
octagonal pattern.
Miscellaneous
“Green Chequer”: Pigeon-racing men
are again having to complain of the low-
down hounds who wait on the adver-
tised line of pigeon races and shoot the
valuable birds as they come over.
There were many losses in a recent
N.S.W. race in which a head wind made
the birds fly low, and several lofts had
to report the arrival of badly-hit com-
petitors—one had both legs shot oft'.
This shooting is an offence punishable by
fine and imprisonment, but, in spite of
rewards offered by racing clubs, con-
victions are hard to get. The murderers
do not only destroy harmless and costly
birds, but hamper a sport which has
proved to the hilt its usefulness as a war
auxiliary.
❖ * ❖ *
“Bumpkin”: There is nothing so use-
less for ordinary purposes as a machine
built for racing. It took 18 months for
the executors of Sir Thomas Lipton
to sell the original Shamrock. They
offered her first as a yacht in commis-
sion, but there were no takers. At last
they sold her for a mite to the ship-
breakers.
* * * *
“Backswoodsman”: The Australian
Bowling Council is inviting applications
for selection in an Australian team to
tour M.L. in January. Owing to the fool-
practice of insisting that players pay all
their own expenses on tour, it is cer-
tain that once more only well-to-do men
will offer themselves for the trip and
be selected, whatever their worth as
bowlers. High time this affected dread
of “professionalism” was cut out of
bowls. The Rugby Union, acknowledged
leader of amateur sport organisations
the world over, does not consider pay-
ing the travelling and housing expenses
of its players on tour in that light.
* * * *
“Bias”: British bowlers have been in-
vited to send a team to this country in
November next year. It is hoped the
tourists will take part in the Melbourne
centenary festivities and then tour the
other States. As the Australian bowls
tourney is due to open in Adelaide in
March, immediately after the return of
an Australian team from Maoriland,
1934 promises to be a busy year for
bowlers, since the usual inter-State games
will also be carried on.


A GALLERY OF GOLFERS.
No. 3.
North Shore Notabilities at Killara.
Killara Golf Club prides itself on being
across the creek from Sydney proper,
and its spiritual affiliations are with New-
castle rather than the place on the south
side of the Harbor. It was the first club
to be founded on the North Shore, and
regular matches with the Newcastle Golf
Club are a feature.
It began at Lindfield, as the Lindfield
Golf and Recreation Club. That was in
1897, and the moving spirit in the forma-
tion was the late J. G. Edwards, the
“Father of Killara,” as he was called,
Four years later the transfer to Killara
took place.
At Killara the club set in again on
35 acres of land procured by J. G.
Edwards, and gradually additional areas
adjoining were picked up, until to-day
the total holding is about 149 acres. Kil-
lara was one of the first N.S.W. clubs
to acquire freehold for its playing area,
This accumulation was spread over about
20 years.
The inland course is on open, undulat-
ing country with a charming outlook in
every direction. There are two playing
courses, one of 6200 yards, and another
of 2500 yards. They were laid out
and altered by various' amateurs and
professionals from time to time, the
present layout being due to a combined
effort, in which Carnegie Clark, brother
of Walter Clark, D. G. Soutar and M.
McKenzie gave advice and assistance.
Killara clubhouse is another of those
which have risen like the Phcenix from
the ashes of themselves to finer things,
The first building at Killara dated from
1901, but was replaced seven years later
by a larger one. This went up in flames a
year ago, and almost on its site a very
fine modern building is being completed,
Killara’s membership is a large one,
somewhere about 800, with, of course,
the usual proportion of associates. It
has had only four presidents in its career,
the first being J. G. Edwards. He was
succeeded by Henry Braddon, and on
himfoffowed C. E. Graham. The fourth
is W. Masthwitz.
Killara can boast some fine trophies.
The oldest is the Springdale Cup,
donated by J. G. Edwards, the competi-
tion for which is always the opening
event of the season. The Killara Shield
is a championship competition trophy,
and others are the Hoylake Cup, pre-
sented by W. S. Cook, the Robert Col-
quhon Memorial Shield and the Peace
Shield, presented by A. Asher Smith.
In the pageant of Killara men passing
before us, the first is R. I. Newton, a
public accountant, who is known on the
links as “The Gazelle” by reason of
his willowy slimness and the fascination
of his soft brown eye. As a golfer he
varies, but as he plays for the joy of it
his 19 handicap is no worry to him. He
was in the A.1.F., which may account
for his shorts and his one-pip moustache.
L. W. Chamberlain, who runs into No.
2 position, is a well-known woolbroker.
L.W.C. is fussy about his game and
the keenest of golfers. He is on the 20
mark at present, but if trying could do
it would figure further down the list.
No. 3 is W. C. Penfold, managing
director of W. C. Penfold and Co.,
printers. He plays off the 18 mark, and
goes in for mid-week and Saturday golf
rather than the competition stuff. A
quiet customer, he is a general favorite
at Killara. At No. 4 is Max Lawson,
managing director of J. R. Lawson and
Co., auctioneers. An ex-A.I.F. man, he
is captain of the A-grade team and a
very sound match player who takes a
lot of beating off the 4 mark. He is
a very well-liked member.
Frank Tilley, on No. 5 stand, is a
notable Sydney stockbroker and manag-
ing director of the Australia and Met-
ropole Hotel cos. He is a committee-
man and the club captain. He plays a
sound all-round game off the 8 mark, and
his beaming smile and pipe have been
well captured by Frith. Sixth on the
panorama is veteran Tom Garrett. The
last survivor of the first Australian
Eleven to visit England, he took eagerly
to golf when he gave up cricket, and
even to-day plays a good game off the
14-15 mark. He is a solicitor.
Walter Clark, the club’s most efficient
professional these ten years past, is No.
7. He is a stocky, alert individual .who
is very popular, and he plays great golf
when in the mood. Percy M. Loutit,
whose determination as he biffs it is
depicted in drawing No. 8 by Frith, is
one of Killara’s old members, and
he is one of those golfers who get the
best out of the game by playing it for
its own sake and not as competition
wallahs. Away from the links, he is a
director of Alex. Moir and Co., the
paper merchants. No. 9 is L. D. Smith,
late managing director of James
Buchanan and Co. He is an ex-captain
of the club and a general favorite. A
Scot, he is naturally a useful gowfer,
swinging a hefty club off the 8 mark.
C. R. Adamson follows. He does not
play nowadays, but his genial person-
ality is always in evidence at the club-
house at week-ends to exercise an im-
proving influence on other members. F.
H. Greaves fills No. 11 place in every
sense of the word, as an eye run over
his expansive outline will show. He is
a r S S-^i < i ltor > 1 V kj S l eisur£ j hours and one
of Killara s hardest workers at golf, for,
though no styhst he gets there just
the same off the 12 mark, while as vice-
president he does a great deal for the
u h
At No. 12 W. P. Masthwitz stands four-
square to the duties of president. He is
one of the foundation members, and a
mighty worker for the club, which owes
him much. As a golfer, he has played for
Killara in many representative matches,
and is still a hot proposition off the 10
mark. Away from golf he is an importer,
Thirteenth place is filled by F. D.
Walker, a manufacturer’s agent from the
North of England, where they are so
open-handed that they’ll give you the
sleeves out of their waistcoats. He is a
quiet and pleasant individual who is quite
content to linger on the 20 mark and
let more ambitious players go roaring by.
L. W. Hudson, on No. 14, is a member
of the firm of Smith and Johnston,
accountants. He is a keen golfer, but
his performance is hardly up to his
aspirations, a trouble some of his friends
attribute to his hat. An ex-A.I.F. man,
he is a life-governor of North Shore Hos-
pital. No. 15, Marcel Leman, is a French-
man, and served with his country’s forces
in the war. To-day he is a woolbuyer
and an ardent and clever golfer, playing
right up to his 16 handicap. Ray Up-
ward, another of the A.I.F. contingent, is
a son of the late John Upward, one of
the founders of the club. He is a steady
and solid golfer; a 10-marker,
N o. 17 is C. A. Reed, otherwise known
as “Concrete.” He is connected with
James Hardie and Co., and cannot be
regarded as a really serious golfer, since
ke j s a i wa y S smiling in spite of the fact
that his handicap is 20. T. K. Smith,
w ho carries the 18 number, is connected
w qh the firm of Thomas, Davis, Sheedy
anc [ Co., accountants. He is on the club
committee, and used to be captain. He
has proved himself a good golfer, having
represented Killara for years in A-grade
matches, and he still plays an excellent
game the 8-10 mark. A keen club
worker also . Next is Frank Middows,
managing director of Middows Bros.,
merchants. He is one of the oldest mem-
hers, and is a former captain and com-
mitteeman. Not in the first class as a
pi a y er himself, he likes nothing better
t han to see the young ’uns coming on.
XT ™ • o t ■ j
No ; 20 is Sam Janes manager and
secretary of the North Shore Gas Co.
He « a " ex-committeeman, and another
week-end player, generally in evidence
leaves and his party are
m the omng ‘
Captain Alexander, another ex-member
of the A.1.F., is the secretary, but is out
of action at present—in hospital, un-
fortunately. He has been a keen worker
since coming to the club some years
a g9> an< J it has come on well under his
guidance. Next, on No. 22, is A. J.
F. Andrew, who is manager of the Ber-
gougnan Tyre Co. He was a Digger, and
is a Pt to mix his golf with boomerang-
throwing, always carrying a number of
these implements about with him. He
is a plus-marker at boomerangs, but has
an 18 handicap at golf,
W. E. Epps, last on the list, is another
of the long-distance members, and
was for many years secretary of the
Royal Prince Alfred Hospital. He is
always ready for a competition, playing
on the 18 mark, and is one of the most
inveterate story-tellers in N.S.W. golf,
He may be recognised by those who fail
to identify Frith’s drawing by the remark
which is ever falling from his lips: “Did
you hear this one?”

while men in search of small holdings go
out into the wilds. There must be thou-
sands -of cases like this in Australia. I
say, rate such ground on the owner’s
valuation, and so force him to use it or
sell it.

“C. Coral”: The Murray Island Fish-
eries Co., having found Asiatic markets
closed against the dried Torres Strait
sardines it has been exporting, is turning
its attention to producing a special line
of cured sardines, packed in cartons, for
home consumption. It is also installing
a plant for tinning sardines, and the
venture is one that Australia should sup-
port. With the great resources available,
we should have our own sardines-in-oil
on the table instead of favoring the im-
ported product every time.

“Blended”: Protection has led to many
old importing concerns establishing fac-
tories, and this process is still going on.
Take Queensland Pastoral Supplies,
which has a great display at Brisbane’s
National Show. It manufactures barb-
wire, tanks, troughing material, roof-
lights, stove recesses, stock licks, iron
fencing-posts, droppers, pig-feeders, blow-
fly-traps, bag-rammers and safes. It
is the only maker of barb-wire in
Queensland, and the Government is one
of its customers.

“J.V.D.”: If the Briton prefers pale
butter to our golden article (B. 26/7/’33)
he is foolish. Prof. Drummond,
Britain’s best authority on nutrition,
pointed out the absurdity of the pre-
judice against yellowish cod-liver oil;
the yellower the oil the more caro-
tene it contains and the better it
is as a source of vitamin A. The same
applies to butter —the yellower it is, the
more nutritious it should be and the
greater its superiority over pale Danish
and English stuff. I am with “C.B.” —
the high vitamin content of our butter
would be a powerful selling argument,
if properly used.
* * * *
“Creole”: Despite the howl for lower
protective duties, one comes across con-
crete evidence that in some instances they
should be higher. While waiting to be
served in a Sydney grocer’s shop I had
a quiz round. The number of imported
foodstuffs on the shelves was an eye-
opener. Among them were shrimps in
glass jars from New Orleans, fruit salad
from California, and rice in packets from
somewhere in the U.S.A. Our Austra-
lian prawns are plentiful and second to
none ; Sydney is glutted with fresh fruit
of the finest quality and our Australian
rice is excellent. Is it laziness or snob-
bery which demands these importations?
* * * *
“W.D.S.” (London): Australia gets
sinfully poor representation here for the
price it pays. Maoriland butter, mutton,
cheese and so on are well shown in Lon-
don and provincial shop windows, as are
also the products of South Africa and
Canada ; but one might look in vain for
anything branded Australian. I did see
a good display in the Strand of Rosella
articles ; oddly enough, they were shown
as Queensland goods. Even in South
Kensington, where there is a permanent
exhibition of industries representing every
part of the Empire, a separate court to
each, our country is among the also-
rans. Coming away from our poor ex-
hibit I felt small enough to crawl
through a keyhole.
* * * *
“Margarine” lets fly:
J- E. Harding (B. 19/7/’33) could have con-
densed his several paragraphs into one by say-
ing “We dairy-farmers want the right to be the
only wholesale vendors of edible fats in Aus-
tralia, so that we may charge the consumer
what we like.” The N.S.W. regulation which
practically prohibits the manufacture, and the
Queensland regulations which to all intents and
purposes prohibit the sale, of edible margarine
are thistledowns which show which way the wind
u b , wing ; such power if granted would
be abused is beyond question. It is being
abused in Queensland at the moment. The
London price of butter is 745. per hundred-
weight, plus exchange, less handling, freight,
storage, insurance and sellers’ commission; in
short, a bit under 90s. Australian. The present
pPf® i n - Q ueens land is 140 s. per hundredweight.
It that is not an outrage, I should like to shake
hands with Ned Kelly. In 1920-21 when ihe
Queensland Government fixed the wholesale
price ol butter below London parity hoarse
cries rent the welkin. We don’t hear anything
about London parity now that it is below the
local price.

NORTH OF
TWENTY-EIGHT
Another Amalgamation
Newspaper employees throughout the
Commonwealth heaved a sympathetic
sigh for their brethren in Brisbane when
the news came through that the “Courier”
was to absorb the “Daily Mail.” They
recall what happened to the “News” and
“Guardian” in Sydney, and the “Regis-
ter” in Adelaide. The “Daily Mail” had
an uncommonly good circulation for
years. It is explained that of recent
months it has not been paying, but news-
papers in that condition have a way of
carrying on for years, unless they are
unfortunate enough to attract the gaze
of would-be Rothermeres and Beaver-
brooks.
These are difficult times for news-
papers, but it seems hard to believe that
Sydney and Melbourne are the only cities
in which two or more morning journals
can exist. It is not a good thing for
journalism or for the cities to see papers
like the “Register” and the “Mail” go.
and to many newspapermen it is a
personal tragedy.
“Stradbroke”: The “Courier’ is in
its 89th year, while the “Mail” can claim
a quarter-century of public service. It
is announced that the result of the com-
bination will follow the lines pursued
by the “Courier,” avoiding control, by
any political party, while being con-
ducted essentially in the interests of the
State. It is denied that the Melbourne
“Herald” proprietary will have a con-
trolling interest in the concern. The
directors are Edward Macartney, M. S.
Herring, Norman White and Charles H.
Briggs. Norman White is the present
managing director of the “Mail”; C. H.
Briggs is general manager of the
“Courier.”
“Vic”: North Queensland settlement
goes ahead steadily, if unobtrusively. The
latest move is to open 12,000 acres of
scrub land for dairying at Clump Point,
in the Tully district. The main require-
ment is road access, and the Government
is to provide this. It is said that when
this country has been disposed of, a
further 48,000 acres is to be offered on
perpetual lease. Seems a pity that the
Government and the Opposition do not
get together and agree on a national pro-
gramme of land-opening in the region
so that it might go up uninterruptedly
and in an orderly fashion whatever Gov-
ernment was in power. Then young
men might look ahead, and fathers who
were in the farming business might pro-
vide for their schoolboy sons.
H* 'k v .
“Wirrigi”: Dr. Hirschfeld, speaking in
Brisbane on personal hygiene, showed
how Barcoo rot was mainly due to lack
of what has come to be known as the
balanced ration. He suggested as a
remedy more citrus fruit and more green
vegetables, and then went on to show
how they should be transported to west-
ern Queensland from the coast. The
solution is to grow in the west; and in
many places I know they do. The finest
oranges I have sampled anywhere in Aus-
tralia were grown in south-western
Queensland and in widely scattered
localities. Same with vegetables, as 1
saw during a recent tour at Doondi,
Goolburra and Kahmoo.
* * * *
“Cossy”: “Arunta” (B. 12/7/ ’33) is
wrong when he says it is unlikely that
Leichhardt ever got to the Northern Ter-
ritory, let alone to the desert on the
borders of Westralia. In 1846 Leich-
hardt managed to reach Port Essington
at the tip of the continent, though by a
more northerly route and with a good
deal of luck. On his last journey his
plan was to steer north, then to strike
west as opportunity offered, by way of
the northern rivers, until he found a
river flowing west. If he was wiped out
by the blacks or, as suggested in some
quarters, caught in a flood, it is strange
that not a trace of men, waggons, equip-
ment and a whole menagerie of live-
stock has ever been found. Gregory found
on the Elsey in the Territory an old camp
characteristic of those made by Leich-
hardt. If Leichhardt got that far, there
was no obstacle to his reaching Sturt
Creek, which flows south-west through
black-soil plains waving with Mitchell
grass, but ends up in forbidding desert.
A better trap for a man of Leichhardt’s
temperament could hardly be devised.
The relics —waggon tyres, an iron chest
and bullocks’ horns—reported to be in
the desert are just what would survive
85 years in the weather, and could not
be used by natives. The fact that Sam
Hazlett returned without them is not
proof they do not exist. Sam was forced
back by lack of water, and is getting
ready for another try.

“Mataranka”: All the noise about the
importation of zebu cattle from Texas
amuses me. To read the self-laudation
of the Government propagandists in the
press, one might imagine that the cattle
industry was being saved and the tick
wiped out by this purely unimportant
experimental move. It is likely that the
zebu is tick-resistant, but will his tick-
resisting qualities be offset by his poorer
marketing qualities? I have yet to learn
that there is likely to be a market for
zebu-cross meat in Smithfield. British
buyers have their ideals as to meat type,
texture and joint Shapes and sizes, and
their eyes are on Scotland instead of on
India or Texas. In the Northern Terri-
tory to-day there is a fine nucleus of
British breeds of beef, and I cannot say
that the experiments which have been
tried with zebus by the Ambrose Bros.

» C . Coral”: At a northern aboriginal
mission station recently ’flu took off a
number of the old people, and funerals
sometimes at the rate of two a day.
when Charlie died he was wrapped
in his blanket, like the rest, and the grave-
diggers got to work. On going to lift
the remains, however, the bearers noticed
that an arm had moved out of position,
The old fellow was still breathing. Forth-
wjth, a disgusted pair of black sextons
hastened to the superintendent’s house
(he himself being down with ’flu), and
remonstrated. “This one he no good!
We dig ’em grave, make everything
proper for funeral, and now that old man
he humbug we.” Very reluctantly they
wen t off, on being assured that there
WO uld quite likely be other claimants
f or the open grave. They were quite
happy next day. “Old Charlie he finish,
die proper this time! ” '
* * * *
“Wyarra”: The longest mail-route sec-
tion over which The Bulletin travels in
Australia is from Laura, at the terminus
of the branch railway line from Cooktown
(N.Q.), to the Batavia River goldfield,
near the inner tip of Cape York Pemm
sula, a distance of about 350 miles. The
journey is done monthly with pack-
horses, and entails the crossing—and fre-
quently the swimming during the “wet”
season —of crocodile-infested streams,
wild-pig country and rugged mountains
swarming with snakes and death adders.
“Letter-boxes” are often days apart, but
the mailman has never been late, except
when the elements were so severe that
neither horses nor man could make any
progress against them. On his return
journey he acts as gold-carrier, without
escort, for the 140-odd miners on the
Batavia River goldfield.
* * f *
“Grunter”: Those Bowen pigs (B.
26/7/’33) are domesticated pigs gone
bush. The wild pigs of the Cape
York Peninsula are a different proposi-
tion. At first their breeding was
checked by the abos., who speared them
for food ; but as the abos. decreased the
pigs gained the upper hand. At present
the jungle country is swarming with
them. They have exterminated several
species of ground-bird life in the Penin-
sula; they kill marsupials, cassowaries,
cattle, horses and dogs. There is talk of
a cannery being established at Cooktown
to market them.
* * * *
“Town”: The many who argue that
cigarette butts do not cause bushfires
can now quote the recent case of a
fisherman and his party who were
wrecked on a small uninhabited island
outside Townsville. From a salvaged
electric battery they succeeded in
lighting cigarettes, but for nearly 20
hours (keeping the cigarettes constantly
going) they were unable to kindle the
smallest flame, although aided with a
supply of benzine and kerosene as well
as moss, leaves, etc., from the island. A
few years back at Rocklands station
(N.T.), I witnessed the deciding of a bet
between two stockmen that one could
start a fire with lighted cigarettes, petrol,
grass and wood shavings before an old
bush abo., then on the “walk-about,”
could kindle his. Although the very old
abo. was slow, he won easily. The stock-
man did not finish.
Gads’ Gossip from Brisbane
The Show’s the thing! From Aug. 1
a carnival atmosphere of gaiety was
apparent in the daytime in the crowded
streets and shops, and at night in theatres
and ballrooms. The additional influx of
visitors from the country, sadly lacking
during our last “depressed” seasons, has
taxed accommodation. Barebacked
Bugattis branded N.S.W. parked in city
streets (despite our stringent ten-day-old
regulations), cheek by jowl with sedate
Daimlers from Victoria. Alluring hats
and frocks are on show, for m’selle must
look her best. Their Exes, started the
ball rolling with a dance at Government
House, and those who curtseyed to their
host were able to wish Sir Leslie all the
best during his 58th year, for appro-
priately he celebrated his birthday on
the occasion.
Routine of office was forgotten the
other night by the State Insurance staff
when they, with their friends, number-
ing 300, turned out to the Troc. to dance.
Insurance-commissioner Watson and
Mrs. Watson met the guests, she wearing
a wheat-shaded net frock over leaf-green
satin. The State Treasurer, F. A. Cooper,
brought Mrs. Cooper, who wore tomato-
red ring velvet moulded to the figure.
Comrade Scullin has been telling Labor
gatherings in Brisbane and in some of
the northern towns all about the wicked-
ness of “the banks” and the evils of the
capitalistic system. Loud applause re-
warded his passionate declarations.
There’s no doubt the Right Honorable
James can talk. Mrs. Scullin is with him,
and she has been entertained quite a lot.
General Spencer Browne, Brisbane’s
veteran journalist (75, not out), gracefully
vacated the chair at the annual meeting
of the Queensland Press Institute. His
successor is E. E. Edwards, of the “Tele-
graph” directorate. Robert Bell, or
Maoriland, was guest of honor (he is pre-
sident of the World’s Press Congress), and
entertained the party with reminiscences.
He got his first job by assuring the boss
he could get advertisements and collect
money. The party included Mrs. E. E.
Edwards, in saxe-blue colorings; Mrs.
Spencer Browne, in navy; the Philp lady,
women-scribes Mrs. Young, Alice Gore
Jones and Evelyn Drury, and editors
Reading and Sligo. It was held at the
National Hotel, where, it was recalled, the
institute was brought into being many
years ago, its parent being dear old Dr.
Ward, genius of the Sydney “Telegraph”
in its palmy days, and now living in re-
tirement in Rose Bay. Mabel Forrest,
Queensland’s well-known authoress, was
elected a life member of the institute, and
regret was expressed at her long illness.
Our prettiest girls in their prettiest
frocks attended the New England Girls’
School annual dance at the Carl-
ton. Wristlets of scarlet and light blue
distinguished the committee. For host-
esses, the girls had collected Mrs. R. J.
McCullough, wearing platinum-silver
lace, and Mrs. Grey Buchanan, wearing
ruby-red. From Government House Cap-
tain Honnor brought Marjorie Wilson
and her Sydney guest, Amy Smith. Mar-
jorie wore primrose satin with cape to
match; Miss Smith’s black lace frock
had short lace sleeves. Secretary Everil
Trude, who beamed at the success of the
show, was in a gaily-colored chiffon
affair. Barbara Hart wore scarlet flat
crepe, and the pretty blonde Sheila White
chose mignonette-green.
Crowds in Queen-street were saddened
when passing His Majesty’s Theatre to
see the shutters up. For weeks the mys-
tic Dante had had a triumphal season,
which was brought to a sudden close by
the tragic death of his son, 21 years old.
killed while riding his motor-cycle.
Uni. women graduates beautified the
main hall with marigolds the other night,
and handed the ham sandwich to repre-
sentatives from other female organisa-
tions. Elsie Harwood was president of
the show, and on the platform were Irene
Longman, Mrs. Cumbrae Stewart, Dr.
Phyllis Cilento and Freda Bage.
Machines in action and so many mil-
lion volts of electricity, set going to
demonstrate artificial lighting, were a dis-
tinct surprise to the guests at the Engi-
neering Undergrads.’ party. Outside, the
Uni. grounds had twinkling lights, and
at the main door was the lettering E.U.S.
done up in bright colors. Prof. R. W. H.
Hawken, dean of the faculty, did the re-
ceiving, with Mrs. Hawken; she wore
black brightened with jonquils.
An arrival by the Chitral was a per-
sonal friend of Sir Leslie Wilson, Major-
General Bruce Hay, of the Indian Army.
He is accompanied by Mrs. Hay and
daughter Sidney. The night they arrived
they dined at Government House, and
to meet them were James Blair, C.J., Elsie
Smith, Dinah Hordern and shipping
favorite Jock Birchall.
Old girls of the Brisbane High School
want more than the £2OOO they’ve already
collected towards a library, so they made
their friends roll up to a concert at the
South Brisbane Hall. Principal M. K.
Jarrett, with her friend Miss Harker, sat
in the front row.
Our hotels have the house-full sign up.
From Melbourne have come the George
Fairbairns and the Herbert Brookes
couple. Importants from Sydney in-
clude Dr. J. J. C. Bradfield and Mrs.
Bradfield. Last time Dr. Bradfield saw
our Exhibition he was nine years old.
Mrs. Littlejohn flew up to Brisbane a
few weeks ago to inaugurate a Queens-
land Citizenship League. Soon after she
left Irene Longman gathered a few intel-
ligents, and secured rooms where women’s
rights will be fostered. A house-warm-
ing party was staged at the Women’s
Club.

LIFE—A BUSINESS
It is a paradox, perhaps, that while Home Life is a refuge from
business, it is itself a business.
Money enters so largely into everything that it must be planned
for in every phase of life.
It is in business that money is earned, in the Home, chiefly, that it
is spent, and there is no sound reason why the spending should not be
regarded as being just as important as earning. In fact, it is far more
important, for earning is difficult, and must employ wisdom, forethoughi.
and energy, while spending is easy, so easy that there is temptation to
spend unwisely.
Every Home, then, is a business, and needs an economic system, of
which the Savings Bank Pass Book can be the valuable basis.

LETTER
Twenty-odd years ago a Sydney poetess
had a golden dream, and, unlike most
dreams, it came true. Agnes M. Storrie
(now Mrs. Kettlewell), who is best known
by her “Twenty Gallons of Sleep,” was
the poetess and it was her brain con-
ceived the idea of Wattle Day. Her
friend Mrs. Clunies Ross was fired with
the thought of a nation on the first day
of spring walking proudly with a sprig
of wattle in its buttonhole ; J. H. Maiden,
then Curator of the Botanic Gardens,
and later Priminster Andrew Fisher
caught the gleam of the vision, and the
wattle became the national emblem. It
is included on our coat-of-arms, it blows
golden on Gallipoli, and on the first of
August every year it is worn by city and
countryside, sometimes shyly, sometimes
gaily, always patriotically. This year, as
always, the city had its tree-planting, and
in time to come the northern pylon of the
Harbor Bridge will arise from a tiny
forest of various wattles, among them
the silver and the Cootamundra.
Wherever it was humanly possible the
600 invitations sent out for the Osborne-
Gordon nuptials last week were answered
in the flesh ; and there must have been
over 400 present in the marquee where
the champagne, like Ole Man River, kept
rolling along and the Mont Blanc of
wedding-cake glittered proudly from a
dais before the moment of its cutting by
the bride. This was something in the
nature of a spectacle; the bride in her
magnolia satins and snowy sherbet of tulle
veil stepped up with her ’groom and her
six leaf-green ’maids and plunged the
steel into the cake’s frosted heart.
The wedding linked up two of the
oldest pastoralist families in the State.
Olma is the elder daughter of the Oliver
Osbornes, of Bundarbo, Jugiong, and Bill
is the elder son of the Deuchar Gordons,
of Manar, Braidwood. The affair
was fashionably timed for the afternoon,
and of course the vows were ex-
changed in St. Mark’s at Darling Point,
which socially holds the same position
here as St. George’s, Hanover Square, does
in London. From her Russian coronet
of seed pearls to her shining slippers
Olma was the perfect bride, and the glit-
tering sunlight of the cold August day
swept across the lustrous satins, her
mauve and cream orchids, as she stepped
from the car to the church under father’s
escort. St. Mark’s and the Laidley Dow-
ling home in Rose Bay-avenue, where
the reception was held, were radiant with
flower and leaf.
Mrs. - Oliver Osborne's powder-blue
ensemble, the long coat collared in grey
Arctic fox, set a model for all brides’
mothers ; and Mrs. Deuchar Gordon
pinned orchids on her navy suit. In the
evening all the principals turned up at
either the Australia or Romano’s to dine
and dance.
When Sir Hugh Poynter married
Mrs. Linda Rule King ten days ago he
was rounding off a very old family con-
nection. ‘His great-great-grandfather and
the lady’s great-grandmother, Ambrose
and Anne Poynter were, in fact, brother
and sister. Anne Poynter married a Dr.
Evans and his son, another Dr.
Evans, came to Australia and settled in
Balmain when Sydney was young. Lady
Poynter is one of the descendants. The
Australian branch of the family has
always perpetuated the Poynter connec-
tion by tacking that name on to one of
the girls. The baronet’s new bride (he
was a widower) has two daughters ; the
elder, about 18, is a budding artist. This
is in keeping with the tradition of a
family that flowers with names like Sir
Edward Poynter, Rudyard Kipling and
Dennis McKail.
The Minister of Education was to have
opened the Royal Art Society’s show last
Saturday, but could not come; so Mines
Minister Vincent did the deed. Looking
straight down the hall he glimpsed Mary
Edwards’s big canvas rich in fruits of the
earth. “Heritage” is an unusual picture,
radiantly blue and gold, which shows
flower and beast and bird and fruit and
vegetable as the accessories of the central
female figure. Mary herself, down from
Mount Wilson, was there, both at the
private view and on opening day.
In its 54th year the show seems to have
sloughed off the skin of middle-age and
become young again, judging from the
brilliant work on the walls. Everybody
was there, from collector Howard Hinton
to the youngest exhibitor, F. McNamara,
from Newcastle. The last, barely 17, was
a bit of a surprise packet to the judges,
who had accepted three of his works.
George Johnston was with pretty Thora
Unger. Mavis Dixon’s black velvet dress
attracted all eyes with its full yellow
sleeves made peasant-fashion. Another
striking bit of color was Mrs. Norman
McLeod’s small skull hat. Her husband
is the Consul for Latvia and the hat,
which came from Prague, was in Latvian
embroidery worked in cherry, blue and
gold. She talked with the president of
the Women Painters, Mary Irvine. This
Letter liked the warm brown tones of
Mrs. Ashton’s outfit. She came with her
Julian, who walked the rooms with some-
thing of the patriarch in his looks.
Artist Jimmy Jackson and his wife
were besieged with congratulations on his
“Bush Track”; Albert Sherman, Doug-
las Pratt and Alfred Coffey were among
the much-looked-at; so was Charlie
Bryant’s sister, for this year Douglas and
Charlie with Leslie Wilkie have opened
the purse of the National Gallery. Mrs.
Vernon Cole’s moss-green hat and ermine
tippet and muff were admirable ; Mary
and Kathleen O’Neill were pretty girls in
black and brown respectively; G. F.
Porter, from Newcastle, sealed two of the
year’s offerings for himself ; John McKel-
vey’s lady wore the smartest hat, fez in
design and black in color; Estelle
Oxnard Smith, in black velvet, wielded a
yellow teapot and refreshed Howard
Barron and other artists; “Man-shy”
Davison was caught standing before the
portrait of himself. Mrs. Arthur Scrivener,
in powder-blue cloth, was with grey-clad
Enid de Loitte, the Souter girls brought
their father, and president Lister Lister
beamed satisfaction on his society’s
efforts.
This is a May Moore camera study of
Dorothy Mannix, now appearing in
“L’Aiglon,” staged at the Savoy by the
University Dramatic Society. She plays
the part of the Eaglet’s cousin and de-
voted adherent, the Countess Camerata,
who aids and abets him in his plan to show
himself the true heir to the greatness of
his father Napoleon. The part of the young
Napoleon has usually been given to a
woman —Sarah Bernhardt, Maude Adams
and Tittell Brune in turn made a success
of the role —but this time Peter Osborn
gets it; Dorothy is understudying him.
She was a shining light last year in the
S.U.D.S. performance of “Love for
Love,” and also played lead when the
Sydney High School Old Girls’ Union
put on “Berkeley Square.”
The term “younger set” has gone out
of fashion, and indeed it has been worn
threadbare. The Prince Alfred Younger
Set has decided to be rechristened “the
Junior Auxiliary” and the Governor’s
lady was the first guest entertained by
this group of untiring girl workers (shep-
herded by Mrs. William Epps) under its
new name. The Junior Auxiliary intends
to meet every week for lunch and hopes
to snare an inspiring speaker for each
rally. Lady Game made a happy little
speech at the first lunch, telling the girls
that the work they were doing reminded
her of the props of a mine she had
visited at Broken Hill—strong, enduring,
sustaining. She took away with her a
great bunch of violets and left the girls
a motto —“Service in Unity ; Unity in
Service.”
Marchesa Virginia Ferrante, the wife
of Italy’s Consul-General, is proving her-
self a very active president for the
Troubadour Ball, the Dante Alighieri
Society’s effort to commemorate the
fourth centenary of Ariosto’s “Orlando
Furioso.” In keeping with the title there
will be strolling minstrels and professional
story-tellers making merry at the ball.
Early in the night a scene from “La
Francesca da Rimini,” by D’Annunzio,
will be acted. This represents the arrival
of a troubadour at the court of Guido
da Polenta. The recital of tales from the
“Orlando Furioso” will be another
unusual interlude. Photo, from Dorothy
Welding.
The Uni. Medical Society’s ball would
have shocked Marie Stopes, for hover-
ing over the ballroom was a stork. How-
ever, it dropped nothing but a freight of
balloons and then coyiy flew back to
the ceiling for shelter. Another stunt
of the evening was the prancing in of
four doctors ready for a little job of
operating ; with them came four white-
clad nurses, masked, and a trolley which
held the subject. In the gleam of spot-
lights the operation was performed, when
the innards turned out to be the usual
bunch of novelties which seem absolutely
necessary to round off a grown-ups’
party.
The frocking was in the super class.
Mrs. Wilfred Fairfax, president of the
committee, was clad in black lace which
wore its sleeves long and was cheered
by a velvet cape and a hand-posy of
pink and red sweet peas. With her was
the doctor, and the two entertained the
official group. Of these Mrs. lan Camp-
bell, who came with her captain, wore
roseate crepes, while Mrs. Garnet Hal-
loran’s frock was of mist-blue lace, the
short cape flashing diamente buttons.
The Cecil Purser couple were important
people at the revels, and their table was
surrounded by friends, including Dr.
Bertie Schlink ; Dr. Alec Johnson, presi-
dent of the Med. Society, was another
host. Mrs. Dew, who helped treasure the
booty, had fashioned her apparel of
moss-green Chantilly. This Letter liked
Mrs. C. Berge’s primrose velvet coat,
worn above the glitter of black sequins,
and the rich quality of Mrs. Coen’s black
and white.
It is to be hoped that when Lady
Game went out to the card party for
the Limbless Soldiers at Hopewood
House, the Lebby Hordern old home at
Darling Point, she was shown the bath-
rooms. Government House itself hasn’t
a pink onyx one, nor one of black-and-
green marble. Walls, floors and fittings
of the two ablutionary apartments (they
are much too palatial to be called
plebeian bathrooms) are of the onyx and
the marble respectively, and the black-
and-green one has a sunken bath and
dolphins or some such sea creatures dis-
porting around the ceiling. The bedroom
which had been Mrs. Lebby’s and which
is the size of a young ballroom, the silky
oak and the maple in the staircase, apart
from the Harbor views and the gardens,
are worth a second glance, even from a
vice-reine. Hopewood House is now
being run as a finishing school by Miss
Nancy Jobson, sister of accountant Alec
Jobson, and till lately of the P.L.C.,
Pymble.
It isn’t generally known that Jimmy
Brash, winner of first prize for the
A.B.C. jazz fantasia, is the music direc-
tor at Cranbrook. His wife, who has a
rich contralto, is something of an autho-
rity on Wagner, and is often associated
with Jean and Lute Drummond in their
lecture recitals on the opera. Mrs. Brash’s
professional name is Alice Prowse.
S. E. Williams, of Sydney Uni.,
left by the Mooltan for the Wills Lab-
oratory of Physics at Bristol Uni., hav-
ing been awarded the 1851 Exhibition
scholarship. Since he entered the Engin-
eering School in 1927 from Fort-street
High he has gathered scholarships, prizes
and honors till it has become a con-
firmed habit. The Deas Thomson
scholarship, the Norbert Quirk prize, the
John Coutts scholarship plus Univer-
sity medals are among the young man’s
harvest.
At the Conservatorium last week a
coloratura soprano displayed for the first
time in public a voice of amazing range
and quality. The singer is Grace Simp-
son ; short, dark and sparkling, she looks
more like a daughter of Italy than of
her native Australia. The programme
was packed with all the lyric-soprano
show pieces, from which the young
singer (she is just 19) emerged as fresh
as a daisy. Hilda Roberts, Richard
Nicholson, Leslie McCallum and Vern
Barnett were the assisting artists.
No wonder women have to rush forth
into the city marts and pluck executive
positions and get busy about politics ;
man is insidiously working her out of her
domain. A few weeks ago the nattiest
line of tatting and crochet at a country
show was by a man; and last week at
Goulburn, in open competition with the
home-makers of the .district, a male
named Holland walked off with the prize
for a batch of scones..
The other afternoon a very deaf lady
in a Paddington tram was manipulating
an ear instrument to catch the words of
her neighbor. Suddenly two women
opposite caught her in action and paused
aghast in their own chatter. Presently
one leaned forward: “I say, missus, are
you broadcasting?” The lady replied
stiffly, “No, I’m deaf.” “Oh,” said her
questioner in a relieved tone, “you did
give me a start. I’m just down from the
country, and I’m talking about all my
friends.”

Melbourne
Chatter
At Caulfield for the V.A.T.C. Steeple-
chase meeting the sun shone brightly but
without warmth, and there was a wind
so piercing as to defy the warmest furs.
No flowers diversified the lawns, which
were a background for the bluest of blue
dresses perking forth amid a sea of
brown and black suits and topcoats and
fur wraps of every sort.
Lieut.-Governor Irvine and the Lud
Mayor were guests at the committee lun-
cheon. In the committee’s ladies’ box
Mrs. Ben Chaffey, wife of the chairman,
topped a ruby-red woollen crepe frock
with a sable cape and red velvet hat.
Others in the enclosure were Mrs. Joseph
Fell and her daughter, Mrs. Jervis Cres-
pin; Mrs. Norman Robinson, whose
caped coat was of brown corduroy velvet
trimmed with fur; Mrs. H. Anderson,
from Geelong; Peggy Essington King;
Sandra Shackell, in a flecked tweed coat
with a brown felt hat; Mrs. Kingsley
Baillieu, in a pale amber crepe cloth suit
and nigger-brown hat; Joan Syme, who
followed a similar color scheme, and
June Baillieu, in tones of brown.
The charity ball on the Mooltan hap-
pened on a freezing night, but aboard
the ship all was cosy. Decks were closed
in with bunting, and miniature shrubs
in green tubs were parked at intervals,
with twinkling lights overhead. Flowers
cheered the dining-saloon and cardroom.
and also the music-room, where there
was a concert directed by Lindsay Big-
gins, of the Uni. Con. Close on a thou-
sand tickets were sold. Amongst those
who danced were the Speck’s Governor-
designate, Sir Ernest Clark, and his lady
(she in black flat crepe), who came with
our Lieut.-Governor and his wife. The
Irvine lady’s robe of deep purple velvet
had slashings of pale gold about the puff
sleeves. The organising committee was
headed by Frank Clarke’s lady, whose
white lace gown was topped by a white
fur coat. C. R. Duncan, Melbourne
manager of the P. and O. Co., came with
Mrs. Duncan, who sported white satin,
with a cape of lacquer red velvet. Mrs.
F. M. Mitchell was ticket-secretary, and
Robert Knox checked the proceeds. Mrs.
Knox was clad in powder-blue georgette
with smoke-grey fox furs. Others in the
throng were Vice-admiral Hyde’s wife,
in wine-hued velvet; Mrs. R. G. Casey,
sen., and her daughter-in-law, Mrs. Der-
mot Casey; Mrs. W. J. Knox and Diana,
the lass in white organdie ; Mrs. George
Blackwood, Mrs. Harold Darling, Helene
Best, in rose-pink lace ; Moira Madden,
in black chiffon, and Margaret James,
in white georgette inlet with Malines
lace.
After the dance on the Mooltan the
stewards counted up the silver and glass-
ware. Nine dozen teaspoons, several
ashtrays and butter-knives, two entree-
dishes and many cocktail glasses didn't
answer the roll-call.
To celebrate the 642nd anniversary of
the Swiss Confederation there was a ball
in cabaret form at the Town Hall, pre-
ceded by a pageant illustrative of Swiss
history. The Swiss Club was responsible
for the entertainment, which ran very
smoothly. Girls in red skirts, white
blouses and laced bodices of black velvet
pirouetted with their partners through
country dances to accompaniment of
accordeon, piano and violin. The final
ballet was danced by pupils of Jennie
Brenan, 22 girls in their white filmy
frocks representing the confederated
cantons. The ball was attended by Lud
Mayor Smith. Cynthia Brookes, who
accompanied her fiance, had a spray of
orchids on the corsage of her black
velvet gown. The Consul for Belgium,
Rene Vanderkelen, came with Mrs. Van-
derkelen, whose garnet-red georgette
irocK Pad touches of velvet. With J. A.
Pietzcker, Consul for Switzerland, who
presided over the official table, was a
group of guests that included many con-
sular representatives and Dr. Maloney.
The Australian Flying Corps Associa-
tion held the joy-stick for a dance at
the Town Hall on Friday night. Minia-
ture aeroplanes dangled overhead. Wing-
Commander Adrian Cole and A. E.
Chadwick were the hosts. Mrs. Cole
came in beige-tinted ribouldingue, and
Mrs. Chadwick sported a frock of blue-
grey georgette with a sprinkle of crystal.
Among special guests were Lud Mayor
Smith and Cynthia Brookes, knight Mac-
pherson Robertson and his lady, she in
black lace, Captain Farquhar Smith,
Brigadier and Mrs. F. B. Heritage, and
Wing-Commander Frank McNamara and
Mrs. McNamara.
Judy, youngest daughter of the R. W.
Stringers, had her twenty-first birthday
celebrated by a dance at Grosvenor,
Toorak. The maiden’s frock of vivid
blue velvet was touched with grey fox fur.
The debs, of the Newman Society Ball
gave a return dance, at which Mrs. D.
Barry and her daughter Ursula, who
trained the buds for their coming-out,
received presents at the hands of the pre-
sident of the society, H. T. Frederico.
Mrs. Frederico was present wearing pale
blue. Phyllis Foster, Eileen Williams and
Marie Knight organised the hop, at
which the youthful hostesses gave their
dainty white frocks a second outing.
There was a bazaar at Mrs. C. S. Bar-
clay’s residence, Kew, as a prelude to a
Continental Market Fair that will take
place in October at Mrs. J. G. Latham’s
home, Malvern, for St. George’s Hos-
pital, Kew.
At St. Mary’s, Caulfield, Dr. John
Hudson G owl and took as life-partner
Gladys, only daughter of the E. Glad-
ding Terrills, of Caulfield. Silver lame
that flowed into a train was the wedding
gown, over which flowed billows of white
tulle. Lena Gowland ’maided in pigeon-
blue draperies, of lace and tulle, with a
wreath of pink blossoms.
Old Limerick lace cascaded over the
trained robe of parchment-tinted satin
worn by Eleanor, youngest daughter of
the late Capt. T. J. Liley and of Mrs.
George Mowling, of Cliveden Mansions,
when she wedded Dr. Norman L. Dodd
at St. Paul’s Cathedral. Olive Dodd,
Doris Newbigin and Kathleen Thomas,
the attendant ’maids, sported frocks of
pale gold dull-surfaced satin, with tissue
caps of the same tint. A dinner at the
Windsor followed the ceremony.
Grammar School chapel saw the wed-
ding of Noel, daughter of the A. Norman
McArthurs, Toorak, and Conway Crof-
ton Seymour, squire of broad acres at
Naracoorte, South Australia. A white
satin trained robe and a tulle veil
secured to a cap of white satin perched
at an angle clad the bride. Alison
McArthur, Noel’s twin sister, and Eliza-
beth Bell attended the leading lady in
frocks of peach-pink flat crepe, with
tulle-brimmed matching hats. Western
District folk figured numerously among
the guests at Grosvenor after the cere-
mony. The bride is pictured here.
Principal feature of an entertainment
arranged by Mrs. T. J. Ryan, hostess of
the Queensland Tourist Bureau, in aid
of the funds of the Women Citizens’
Movement was a talkie picture of the
Barrier Reef, with glimpses of Banana-
land. Songs by Molly Warden and Jock
Thompson, with May Broderick at the
piano, were interludes. Mrs. Britomarte
James, president of the W.C.M., thanked
Mrs. Ryan, who received a posy.
The new Governor of Tasmania and
his wife are not making their first
acquaintance with Australia. They were
here a few years ago, when Sir Ernest was
a member of the British Economic Mis-
sion. Here is the new chatelaine of
Hobart’s Government House, as she
appeared to a Broothorn camera on
arrival in Melbourne, en route for the
Apple Isle. She says the memories of
her former visit to these latitudes are
very pleasant. Lady Clark is musical,
fond of gardening, loves dogs and is a
pillar of the Girls’ Friendly Society.
A bunch of happenings from Perth:
Scotch College dance, an annual spree at
which the supper is always something special,
was held in Cottesloe Hall. Flags of all
nations and the school colors, represented by
Iceland poppies, violets and carnations, made
a joyous display. The Anderson girls were
belles of the ball —Mary in white satin, Flora
in blue lace with a velvet girdle, and Vans a
whirl of cherry and white organdie with a
starched white frill hiding the tips of pink ears.
Mrs. Anderson was in black, Mrs. P. G. Hamp-
shire chose beige lace, and blue found followers
in Mrs. Rupert Monger and Mrs. Henry Greig.
Sea-green suited blonde Pat Oldham. Joan
Clune was a youthful miss in red satin. Nancy
Allnutt chose voile of a misty grey. Organdie
in blue was worn by Lesley Robertson and in
lemon by Mollie Henderson (of Queensland).
Headmaster P. C. Anderson was a looker-on.
A capacity house, the women wrapped to
the ears in furs, listened to the concert by the
Oriana ladies’ choir. Among artistic render-
ings was a Brahms group, in recognition of the
composer’s centenary year. Soloist Zoe Lene-
gan, in moss-green velvet, warbled and Robert
Gibson fiddled. Choir’s organiser Mrs. Tread-
gold wore tomato-shaded crepe satin, and hon.
sec. Miss Hamilton was in blue. A. J. Leckie
flourished a baton and Veronica Kenniwell
accompanied.
Maude Mitchell arranged bridge tables in
honor of her pals Lilia Malloch and Ariel
McGhic. Miss Mallock is just home after her
six months’ globe-trotting. Miss McGhie now
lives in Brisbane and is paying the West a fleet-
ing visit.
Margaret Wansbrough, of Geraldton, and
Kevin Kelly, of Perth, were made one in the
Havelock-street Church. Ivory satin and chiffon
sprayed with seed-pearls formed the wedding
garment. The skirt descended in a train and
the tulle veil was moored to a little pearl-and-
white-heather-trimmed cap, which was worn in
her girlhood by the bride’s, grandmother.
’Maids Beryl Birchley and Gloria Nelson chose
dawn-pink for their velvet gowns and feather-
weight hats.
Parties are in full swing for Cynthia Dun-
man, who is busy with the last stitches of her
trousseau. ’Groom-to-be is Dr. Tim Godlee.
Molly Ick invited Miss Dunman and some of
her pals to a morning brew of tea in the Reper-
tory Club’s spacious new home in Westralian
Chambers.
President and committee of the Karrakatta
Club took the opportunity of pouring con-
gratulations upon the Mitchell lady at a lun-
cheon party in the winter garden. Mrs. S. J.
Anderson did the honors in a black toilette and
the guest of honor smiled appreciation in a
tailored suit of coffee tonings.
Applause was long and loud at Ida Geddes’s
recital under the v.-r. dome. Miss Geddes
sang delightfully and looked her best in black
velvet. In a generous slice of “The Marriage
of Figaro” she was assisted by Elfie Hughes,
Myrll Frape and John Beilby; in “The Rhine-
maidens’ Trio” she mingled her liquid notes
with those of Barbara Russell and Gertrude
Hutton. Lio Chase displayed his technique
upon the fiddle. Choice spoil from many a
garden was handed over the dais.
Mrs. Geoff Mclntyre mixed cocktails at the
Savoy in honor of the Queensland bride of her
brother, Dr. Dan Quinlan. A host of friends
and relations came along to be presented.
The jollities of Adelaide:
The home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Walkley, j
North Adelaide, was lit with multi-colored J
lamps for a ball, at which the guests were 150
friends of their sons and daughter. Dancing
was in a huge marquee, decorated in jade-
green, with supper in another marquee. Mrs.
Walkley was gowned in cinnamon-toned georg-
ette, and her daughter Margaret wore a frock
of old-gold crinkled crepe. Mrs. Colin Walk-
ley chose beige-and-blue patterned chiffon, and
Mrs. Allan Walkley, a recent bride, was in
pale pink angel-skin.
Almond blossom was featured in profusion
at the Uni. dance. Dr. and Mrs. Rex Matters
received the guests, Mrs. Matters gowned in
black georgette with flesh-pink outlining the
bodice.
Mrs. Douglas Fox was hostess at a bridge
party in the panel room at the Piccadilly. The
decorations on the tea tables were pink sweet-
peas and heuchera. Mrs. Fox wore dull led
velvet with a toque to match.
The Women’s Hockey Association entertained
the visiting girl hockey and lacrosse players at
morning tea at the Lyceum Club. Among the
guests were Dr. Marie Hamilton, president of
the association in N.S.W., and Edith Thompson,
who was manager of the English hockey team
that visited Australia in 1927.
Prince Alfred Old Scholars’ Association’s hop
was at the Palais Royal, where three genera-
tions were represented. J. F. Ward (present
head) and his wife entertained a large party
in their box.
Mrs. C. T. C. de Crespigny, North Adelaide,
gave an at-home at the Queen Adelaide Club
for her daughter Nancy, who has just returned
from England, prior to Miss de Crespigny’s
departure for Melbourne.
Senator J. H. Duncan-Hughes launched
Lisette Kohlhagen’s show of water-colors at
the Society of Arts rooms. The artist has de-
lineated many of the pretty spots round about
Adelaide.
Mary Stuckey, who has been spending
several months in Adelaide after an absence of
five years in China, left with her brother, Dr.
E. J. Stuckey, in the Nankin, returning to
Asia.
And a spot of social news from the
Speck:
Members ,of the police engineered a ball at
the City Hall in aid of the Child Welfare Asso-
ciation and raised a substantial amount. The
Lieut.-Gov. and his lady were present, likewise
Col. and Mrs. J. E. C. Lord and other repre-
sentative members of the association. Members
of the “Midnight Frolics” co., playing at the
Royal, went along after the show and helped
to entertain the guests.
Hutchins School Old Boys gave a dance at
the Imperial, where, in the ballroom, the school
flag was draped over the front of the musicians’
gallery, and there were bowls of holly and
early wattle. The Head and Mrs. J. R. O.
Harris were present, but most of the dancers
were in their teens.
The Old Launcestonians’ dance, at the Gram-
mar School, was an informal and cheery affair.
The long dining-room was used for dancing,
supper tables were set out in the recreation
room, and bridge was played in other rooms,
where fires and bright floral decorations gave
an air of comfort.
The Ashbolt lady went off in search of sun-
shine on the Oronsay’s cruise to the Islands.
Dr. and Mrs. Hogg (Launceston) are travellers
in the same liner to the New Hebrides.
The Prime Minister and Mrs. Lyons spent
a quiet week with their young family at their
home at Devonport.
Dr. and Mrs. Jarman are flitting from Laun-
ceston to Sydney. The Choral Union fare-
welled the doctor, who has been its director
and conductor ever since its formation, at
supper after their last concert. Mayor Hollings-
worth, on behalf of the society, presented the
departing guest with a travelling case.
Died, recently in Tasmania, Mrs. George
Spencer, one of the earliest members of the
Speck’s Victoria League, and a member of the
N.C.W. Mrs. Spencer’s husband, who pre-
deceased her by many years, served as an ensign
in the Crimean War, and was nursed by
Florence Nightingale.

December will see pianist Percy
Grainger among us again. He is coming
from the U.S.A. to discuss plans for the
establishment of Melbourne’s Museum
of Music.
Pianist John Simons continues to make
progress in England. He has won a
scholarship at the Matthay school and
has appeared in public as accompanist
to Marjorie Schmitt, a Melbourne violin-
ist (also a former pupil of the Uni. Con.),
who gave a recital at the Wigmore Hall.

“Edin”: When Uncle Sam decided to
return to light beer, endeavors were made
to tap overseas sources with rush orders.
Certain distributors in San Francisco
looked to Maoriland for substantial ship-
ments of a 3.2 brew, but unfortunately
an order for 25,000 hogsheads has gone
begging, nothing under 4.5 strength being
available. With time the essence of the
contract there was no chance of a special
brew being prepared for forward de-
livery.

Artist Mabel Hookey, of Rokeby
(over the water from Hobart), dips an
informative pen into a page of friendly
chat from Nikko, Japan. With her
sister Dora and chum Blanche Murphy
she is in search of a stone lantern for
the old garden of Rokeby House. They
came on an old collector who had
filled his garden with his hobby. “His
wife brought us cushions, green tea
and little cakes, and we finally left
him to think it over and name his price.”
Mabel Hookey declares the Japanese air
high up amongst the hills to be “as good
as that in Tasmania.” A daughter of the
Apple Isle can say no more.

What would be the reactions of the
Divine William and the strange, lovable
author of “Les Caprices de Marianne”
on hearing that a Tasmanian professor
with the un-Tasmanian name of Malthus
had earned a doctorate of literature in a
Maoriland university by writing a thesis
in French on “The Influence of Shak-
speare on Alfred de Musset”? They
both, probably, could express better than
any modern the appositeness of such a
cosmopolitan linking of the world’s most
widely-read playwright to his nineteenth-
century French disciple, whose most
Shakspearean masterpiece only reached
the Paris stage at all because a touring
Gallic actress happened to see it played
in Russian in St. Petersburg!

“Ziphion”: Every winter the State of
California used to get a parcel of what
we call “bagmen” who had stolen rides
on the railroads. In 1931 they poured in
at the rate of 1200 a day, and the Cali-
fornians thought they’d better do some-
thing about it. They established camps
into which men went voluntarily to
barter their labor for food, shelter, cloth-
ing and tobacco. Every man had to
work; he was not required to remain
if he disliked the conditions. There were
forestry camps, highway camps and other
sorts of camps, all working out at a
cost of about half a dollar a man per
day. The plan prospered; in April last
there were 56 camps in California with
7000 men. Now President Roosevelt is
establishing national labor camps where
the men will be paid a dollar a day plus
food. Can’t we have something of the
kind in Australia?

“Pawang”: Two thousand English doc-
tors have walked out of the B.M.A.
because they object to its orthodoxy.
One of the bones of contention is the
germ theory of disease ; this, the seces-
sionists claim, has been given far too
much importance, and is viewed from
the wrong angle. As a steady patron of
the profession, I am interested in the
argument, and in all wrangles of the kind,
I have been treated in six different ways
by six different specialists for the same
trouble. Not one of the six gave me the
impression that he thought beyond the
nostrum he happened to be interested in
qt the moment. In my experience, the
practice is to concentrate on the effect
rather than the cause and pump a serum
into you. If the pumper is challenged he
will tell you that if he suggested any more
fundamental treatment involving per-
haps a change in his patient’s habits, he
would lose the patient. Anyhow, not
one patient in ten would obey him. This
may be true, but it is not ethics as a
good motor mechanic understands them,

The most important step musically the
Broadcasting Commission has taken is
the proposed engaging of Cecil Sher-
wood to come to Australia to sing the
tenor roles in a series of operas for
which _he is already famous in Italy.
Cecil is a native of Sydney (his father
was a superintendent of police, and he
has the rare if not unique distinction of
“Have yer been among the cows before?”
"No; you're the first I've worked for ”
going from Australia to Italy as a student
and remaining there to become one of
that country’s leading operatic stars). As
far back as 1921 Cecil (he is billed as
Lionello Cecil) had made over 500
appearances in operatic parts. His voice
is very beautiful, silvery and fresh, and
the young man’s acting satisfies even the
exacting audiences of Italy. It was he
who was chosen to record with T. P.
O’Connor’s brilliant protegee, Peggy
Sheridan, the whole of “Butterfly.”

“Runa”: We were camped at Kawau
Island, the popular holiday resort near
Auckland (M.L.), when a newspaper was
delivered one Saturday morning. It con-
tained an article by a well-known writer
on the subject of suitability in clothes. Par-
ticularly did the writer deride the person
who tried to lead the simple life in com-
bination with pretentious attire, and his
strictures on the utterly unsuitable
clobber worn by some campers and pic-
nickers won our enthusiastic approval
when read aloud at our camp-fire. Just
then a dinghy rowed by a Maori beached
near by with a fare from a seaside cot-
tage up the bay, and we watched with
pity an elderly gentleman step ashore,
looking anxiously at his immaculate
bright tan shoes as he evaded the tide. He
wore a bowler hat, a grey tie to match
his suit, complete with pearl pin, and
carried a walking-stick and a pair of
lemon kid gloves. We watched him
hobble over the pebbly beach, and in-
quired from neighbors who he was.
“Don’t you know him?” was the sur-
prised reply. “He’s Blank, the writer.
There’s a ripping article by him in the
paper this morning on ‘Clothes.’ ”

“Ardennes”: The stag Osbert is dead,
and the fact has been cabled all around
the world. In his hot and gallant youth
Osbert showed more enterprise than has
been credited to any of his tribe. On a
winter’s eve in 1924, hotly pursued by
the ladies, gentlemen and hounds of the
West Kent Hunt, Osbert decided to emi-
grate to France. He plunged into the
sea and was nearing Dunkirk when a
French trawler butted in, hauled him on
board, and insisted on taking him into
port as a passenger. Osbert objected,
and his objections were not selfish. As
soon as the trawler disembarked Osbert
on to the wharf at Dunkirk a gendarme
arrested the ship, the crew and Osbert
on a charge connected with the offence
of carrying livestock without a license.
The matter was reported to the French
Minister for Pigs, and he said that, as
Osbert wasn’t a registered French deer, he
didn’t exist, and his arrest was an anom-
aly that could be corrected only by the
shooting of Osbert. The Dunkirk gen-
darmerie replied that unfortunately this
was the close season for deer, and the
Minister shut up abruptly. The Dunkirk
municipality, alarmed by Osbert’s appe-
tite, offered to return the monarch of the
glen to the West Kent Hunt, f.0.b., plus
freight, fodder, insurance and any other
charges. The British Minister for Pigs
put his foot down and said that Osbert
couldn’t re-enter the country of his birth
save after six months in quarantine,
during which consignors would have to
pay for his maintenance. So the Dun-
kirk municipality sold Osbert to a res-
taurateur at Le Touquet, who, instead of
inflicting tough old Osbert on his patrons
as venison, turned him loose in his own
private deer-park, whence comes news of
the hero’s demise. So, despite the politi-
cians, the Anglo-Gallic entente stands
where she did.

“Rectory Field”: Yet another attempt
is to be made by the English Northern
Union to establish its game in Lon-
don. A syndicate has offered to
purchase the entire Wigan Highfield
team on the hoof and lodge it in
London, at the White City. The club
has a poor record in North of Eng-
land football, and new players will have
to be acquired. Then will come the ques-
tion of whether the Northern Union will
allow the club to affiliate and play in
its competitions. For years past similar
attempts have been made, especially in
Wales, but all have proved failures.

“Wingy”: Britain boasts a little-heard-
of golf championship for one-armed
players. This year’s tourney will be de-
cided in September by 36 holes medal
play at the Burgesses course, near Edin-
burgh, and entries are in already from
America, France, Germany and Bel-
gium, in addition to the British contin-
gent. Many of these men are good per-
formers. Years ago a Frenchman named
Botcazon figured in the British open at
Prestwick which was won by Harry Var-
don. On his home course he was able
to do 18 holes in 72.
* * * *
“Carnoustie”: Since Cyril Tolley, the
English amateur, returned to Britain
from America, he seems to be driving
longer than ever. There are many tall
yarns about his performances and the
latest tells of a drive of 340 yards. There
was no official measurement, but the
drive is worth comparing with some held
at Troon, in Scotland, after the Open
championship some years ago. All the
leading professionals and amateurs had
a go and the best of the test was 278yds.
2ft. 6in., by D. A. Curtis, an English
pro. Walter Hagen and Abe Mitchell,
famous drivers both, did 270yds. 1 Sin.
and 263yds. 6in. respectively; and Tolley
was eighth on the list with 263yds.
* * * *
“Crank”: The shaft drive for motor-
cycles which was tried and abandoned
years ago is in high favor again with
Continental makers, though those in
Britain are still shy. In one typical Ger-
man model the engine clutch and gear-
box are in one unit, mounted trans-
versely, with the result that the crank-
shaft is down the middle line of the
machine instead v of across it as with the
chain drives. Gear-box and clutch are
on car lines, and the loss of power in
transmission due to road vibrations,
which was one of the drawbacks of the
old makes, is claimed to have been over-
come. If effective, the shaft drive should
as surely oust the troublesome chain as
it did in the case of motor-cars.


Green Garters.
BY M. FORREST.
AMELIA SPRIGG had a leg.
Except by accident, no man had
ever seen it, for Amelia was an
ageing spinster. She had passed her 45th
birthday when the springtide came that
was to change the whole tenor of her
days.
It was a dry spring and dusty. But tne
trees put forth delicate green buddings,
and the silky oaks, leper-white with the
fine castings of unwatered roads, held
in their faintly stirring branches rich
promise of October gold.
Gold glinted in Amelia’s hair, but
there was grey, too. She made blouses
and skirts and jumper frocks and even-
ing dresses of sorts in her little rooms
over the butcher’s shop. Her regular
customers were few, but, with casuals,
they sufficed to keep her from actual
want. Sometimes a bushwoman down
for the Show had given her a good order
for plain sewing.
Amelia was conscious of her leg. She
treated the shapely supports to the best
lisle thread and scorned imitation silks,
although she had been brought up a
Methodist. Churchgoing had lapsed this
spring, and a distant cousin who had
gone into complete mourning for a hus-
band she had hated suddenly remem-
bered the cousinly bond from beyond
Melbourne. She posted up to Queens-
land a pair of flesh-colored real-silk hose.
Amelia put the stand mirror on the
floor that night to see her ankles.
Because she had never worn garters,
Amelia’s pretty rounded knees became
absorbed gracefully, as knees should, in
the shinbones without any sharp angle.
Once she had contemplated wearing
skirts slit at the side. That was when
the young man from the Bush Brother-
hood sang in the choir, but she couldn’t
bear the look of his white, hairy hands,
with fingers like uncooked pork sausages.
To-night, as she watched her legs
pirouetting before the mirror on the un ■
carpeted floor of her bedroom over the
butcher’s, Amelia contemplated the
notion of a garter. One, at least —on the
left leg.
Garters were “in.” None of the flap-
pers on the trams minded how often they
let the conductors and their male escorts
know that. It was an age of crossed
knees. Amelia remembered that they
had been condemned as unwomanly in
her youth. Perhaps if she had not been
so “womanly” she might have married
long ago.
She did not particularly want to
marry. She had seen too much of the
family life of her contemporaries: girls
who had gone to school with her. But
it did seem a pity that no male eye had
ever been able to admire her legs, except
by accident.
Amelia blushed and put out the gas.
She went to bed in the dark.
In the garden that crawled to the
butcher’s back windows, a frangipanni-
tree was just breaking into plump, deep-
scented budding.
Amelia sighed.
Next day she thought of clothes;
summer clothes.
She could walk as far as Fortitude
Valley and look in the windows after
working hours. She was a good walker ;
her instep was high. She remembered
someone once saying she must have
Moorish blood because the . most arched
feet in the world came from Morocco.
She surveyed her graceful foot in the
flesh-colored hose. Then she pulled
down her ankle-length dress, set a row of
pins between her teeth and started tack-
ing.
Amelia walked out that evening, when
the gold had died behind One Tree Hill,
and there were baroque mists clinging to
the Valley, and Brisbane was going forth
to look for amusement in picture shows,
theatres and Christian Science meetings.
Then the green garters happened. She
had not got to the Valley, but was star-
ing through the plate glass of a Queen-
street shop. They were of silk elastic,
with frilled edges, and each was fastened
with a tiny blown rose, an impudent,
alluring thing.
“French,” sighed Amelia.
She tried to see the figure, but the
ticket was turned inside; a bad sign.
Cheap things let you see what they would
cost; expensive articles tried to lure you
into the shop in the innocence of soul
that presumes a bargain.
She went home early. Other shoos
did not seem to interest her as much as
usual, though she saw a winter hat, not
too wintry, marked down to ss. lid.—a
grey modest thing suitable to a single
woman of 45.
She sighed again. Of course,, she
would buy that to-morrow, instead of the
green garters ; but she was horribly tired
of marked-down things and of apparel
appropriate to her age and respectability.
That night she dreamed of those green
garters. They danced before her eyes
next day when she fitted the butcher’s
wife, who had left the dividing door
open ; the smell of meat had followed
her up the narrow stairs. The butcher’s
wife perspired freely. She puffed, and
asked Amelia to pull her stays in: “I’m
getting that stout,” she complained.
Amelia tried to say something polite
and nearly swallowed a pin. She resisted
an insane wish to stick one in the red
mottled back pillowing over the high,
old-fashioned corsets. The smell of
meat brought flies with it. One buzzed
metallically against the pane where
Amelia had hung a white-frilled blind,
though nothing could look through ex-
cept the birds and stars —unless an air-
man took a detour.
“Aeroplanes. How wonderful! ”
Amelia thought. No smell of meat. Far
away from butchers’ shops and butchers’
wives and their sweating backs!
At noon Amelia took a tram to town
and deliberately entered the shop where
the green garters snared. All the way in
she trembled lest some luckier soul
should be now wearing them on a pro-
bably indifferent leg. The five-and-
elevenpenny hat could stay where it was,
to be snapped up by a 9 a.m. bargain-
hunter. Amelia had no use for it.
“Price of the green garters?” The
shingled shop-assistant brought out a sage-
green pair fastened with a black enamel
buckle, marked 3s. 6d. There was also
a “neat” black pair at 2s. lid. She
assured Amelia they wore quite well; her
own mother bought them.
Amelia had a pound in her purse ; she
gripped the imitation leather. It would
mean stinting herself of food for days ;
but that didn’t matter any more.
The girl, with a speculative eye and a
little stiffening of the sympathetic manner,
was taking the green garters out of the
window. They were even more beauti-
ful than Amelia had supposed through
the dusty glass. They had shimmering
lights in them. Amelia’s fingers in the
grey cotton gloves closed upon her prey.
She laid them against her throat for an
instant where the curves were constricted
by cheap lace and whalebone.
Blushing, she fumbled in her purse as
the shopgirl put the cover on the little
cardboard box, and asked whether she
would like the price rubbed out, as it
might be for a present.
A present! The price! What was the
price? Blood hammering in Amelia’s
ears had somehow made her deaf to
the figure.
The green garters were twelve-and-six.
That left seven-and-six for food for the
rest of the week. Ample ; she could buy
potatoes.
Amelia held the little box clutched in
her hand all the way home. Suppose
she lost it? Suppose there were pick-
pockets left over from the Show?
That night she set the six-by-six stand
mirror on the floor again.
Downstairs the butcher’s wife joked
with her husband. “Old Sprigg must be
learning to dance,” she sniggered.
The butcher went a good deal to the
pictures. He was not surprised at any-
thing. “You never can tell,” he said.
The neighbors were quick to notice
that Amelia was wearing her dresses
short and had smartened in appearance.
One, a lonely, middle-aged man who
had come to lodge at the widow’s in that
bungalow with the pretty garden, found
Amelia much in his mind’s eye. He liked
the way she got on and off trams, the
way she carried her head in the old felt
hat. The green garters that no one ever
saw precluded the hat even at five and
eleven, and women thought she couldn't
be doing well to wear the winter hat she
had had two years already. “These ready-
made dresses do ruin the dressmaking
trade,” they said.
The butcher’s wife offered to lend her
an old summer hat with a blue feather.
Amelia shook her head : said blue did
not suit her.
“Fancy her caring what becomes her,”
the butcher’s wife said that night over
fried sausages. “At her age. Ain’t she
funny?”
“Must be getting a bloke,” the butcher
said.
And Amelia was. The middle-aged
man was handsome still, with his grey
hair and his very blue eyes, and he had
asked Amelia to go to a concert with him.
He was something on a newspaper, and
he got passes. Dress-circle passes.
Amelia scarcely knew how it was they
had begun to talk. They went into town
on the same tram, and once he gave her
a seat, but she was not quite sure (for
in the beginning he did not interest her
much) whether he or she began the con-
versation. But they slid easily into
friendship.
One day when she climbed hurriedly
on a car she saw his eyes riveted.
A man had seen the green garters at
last, and appreciatively.
She went to supper in his flat one wet
night. He had brought her home from
the theatre, and she had complained of
feeling cold.
There was a photograph of a woman
on the table. He saw her looking at it.
“My wife,” he said —he was a man of
few words. «
His wife was a pretty woman with
big eyes and not much frock.
Supper was arrowroot biscuits and
cocoa, made over a spirit lamp. He
seemed to have divined how dreary life
was over the butcher’s, and Amelia felt
she was going the whole hog. Not that
his advances were dangerous.... yet. She
might have thought he was courting her
in regular style, but the calm fashion in
which he indicated the picture of his
legal owner settled that.
He saw her to the butcher’s gate and
at parting pressed her hand.
Amelia blushed into her hard pillow.
At 45 she was wearing green French
garters with pink roses on flesh-colored
stockings, and she had embarked on an
affair with a married man.
People began to talk. The shoemaker’s
wife withdrew her custom. She com-
menced her conversations about Amelia
with the inevitable “At her age,” and
then everyone guessed what was coming.
The middle-aged newspaper man con-
tinued to buy packets of arrowroot bis-
cuits and to make cocoa for Amelia. She
needed it these days ; there was not much
over when she had paid her rent.
Although the butcher’s wife gossiped be-
hind Amelia’s back she did not withdraw
her patronage. There was the payment
for the two ill-ventilated overhead rooms
to consider.
October blossomed a world of silky-oak
gold. Jacarandas were blown like an
amethyst mist on the blue sky.
“A drought,” Queensland grumbled,
but Amelia and her green garters had
found the roses of romance.
She did not ask him about his wife.
It was so obvious that he was unhappily
married ; perhaps his wife had left him
for a younger man and he was too proud
to fight in the divorce courts.
The desire to sacrifice, so dominant a
factor in the lives of women like Amelia,
made her almost anxious to suffer for
his sake. A tame love would, have had
nothing to recommend it, and Amelia
never considered such material things as
the advantage of having a husband to
feed and clothe one.
Amelia bought flowers when she should
have bought bacon, and when the middle-
aged man gave her a rose she tended it
like a babe.
Things don’t stand still. That is life’s
tragedy—and its comfort. The green
garters, overmuch worn, were beginning
to stretch and fray. You can’t very well
mend silk elastic ; it “bubbles.”
The day came when Amelia wept, for
she knew she could not afford to replace
them.- Then she cleaned her one evening
frock with petrol.
He was taking her to a concert at the
Exhibition. She was depressed ; he was
quiet. The night was hot with a threat
of storm. Thunder growled behind the
hills. But the stars held sway when they
came out of the crowd in the hall to
the other crush on the tram.
The newspaper man had had a rise.
He hailed a taxi. Amelia had never
ridden in a taxi.
The thudding wheels, the hooting horn
cheered her sinking spirits. She had felt
old, disillusioned; the green garters
would soon be but faded remnants of a
fleeting glory.
Spring was mellowing into summer.
There would be autumn, winter. Her
neck, still plump, would wrinkle; her
bright eyes would grow dim, her hair
snow-white. She had been a fool; worse,
an old fool.
He meant nothing, one way or an-
other.
“I’m sure you’re lonely to-night,” he
said.
She did not answer; she wanted to
cry.
Perhaps, after all, romance was pain-
ful, more so than garterless respecta-
bility and ss. lid. hats.
“Come and live with me, dear,” he
said.
Amelia sat bolt upright. Now that the
blow had fallen, could she really do it?
The world well lost for love, and she
nearly 46! Or would she let him go?
Through the window came a whiff of
roses, elusive, lovely things, where some-
one watered late (and against regula-
tions) a hidden garden. Dust, roses ; hi >
strong arm about her yielding waist.
“Yes,” she said.
He paid the taximan and followed her
into the flat. She dimly wondered what
his landlady would say about the new
“arrangement.” The widow had always
had references with her lodgers.
Her face, reflected in his oval mantel
mirror, was flushed, but she still looked
eminently respectable. How long before
the “life of sin” left its mark?
She started at his wife’s portrait. A
fierce primitive woman reared in her
soul.
She snatched the other woman's
picture from the table, tore it in half
and threw it in the grate amongst the
dried pampas grass the landlady kept
there in summer.
He was mixing the cocoa. He looked
at her and laughed.
“Are you angry?” Amelia asked
humbly. He was all she had now be-
tween her and a disapproving world.
“Of course not.” He held the cocoa
spoon in one hand but came across to
kiss her. “But why be jealous of the
dead?”
“Dead!” she gasped. She was sud-
denly conscious of the shortness of her
flared skirt. She tried to pull it down.
“Do you think I am a potential bigam-
ist?” he asked. “She was too young for
me ; too modern. I like a sensible woman
who can be at the same time attractive.
I don’t think you know how attractive
you are, darling.”
Amelia continued the ineffectual
struggle with her skirt. The atmosphere
had changed. She could face her own
eyes in the mantel mirror now.
Like any respectable suburban wife she
lied glibly. “Of course I knew she was
dead. If she had not been, do you think
I would ever have walked out with
you?”
She picked up the torn photograph.
“A little paper and gum,” she suggested.
“Don’t worry, dear.” He was bring-
ing her a steaming cup. She looked at
the arrowroot biscuits.
Yes, of course. Scarlet women had
champagne, and birds on toast.
Marriage, arrowroot biscuits, cocoa.
Yes, she might have known.
Somehow Amelia did not think she
would buy green garters with pink rose-
buds for her wedding outfit.
Green garters were so different.
Gippsland.
When brave MacMillan, years gone by,
Beheld its promise rare,
The land beneath his Scottish eye
Seemed unco’ good and fair.
From range to sea its streams and rills,
Long-winding to the shore,
Through fertile flats from wooded hills
Prophetic message bore.
By distant lakes the splendid plains
That green by Sale to-day,
Their rich soils wet by frequent rains,
He viewed that far-off day;
For ever fair, for ever fine,
For ever sweet with song,
From Bairnsdale to the borderline,
From Bright to Dandenong.
From Mallacoota —dozing still,
Though Gabo’s task is done —
We climb the slopes of Tracey’s Hill
And, with The Drummer won,
In time to Orbost’s flats of gold
Our winding highway wends,
To bring us, mile by mile, an old
Delight that never ends.
’Neath steep Kalimna shine the Lakes
That met MacMillan’s gaze,
And straighter lines the roadway takes
Through sunny fields of maize.
Where sweeps the snow-fed Tambo on,
The Mitchell’s waters flow,
And clear Latrobe and Nicholson
And sandy Avon go.
Through glowing farmlands, on and on,
By Rosedale willows green,
Traralgon rich and Yarragon,
With hamlets set between.
Our ways are sweet and bountiful
With pleasant scene and song,
Until we pass from Warragul
To dusk, at Dandenong.
The glory that MacMillan dreamed
Shall in the future be
Of this fair province, many-streamed
And rich from range to sea;
With golden promise written plain,
Her wide expanses o’er
Of constant season, certain rain
And sunlight evermore.
When falling furrows greet my eyes
On humble acres won
By years of toil, my visions rise
Like eagles in the sun.
Then present wastes are turned to fields
In that long future when
The gracious Mother gladly yields
Her benisons to men.
It may not hap within my time —
Our country’s growth is slow—
But. ere my sons’ sons see their prime
This proven land will flow
With milk and honey; and the horn
Of plenty shall abide
With her, whose poets to be born
Will sing her wealth and pride.
VICTORIA.

BY ANGUS O’COHEN.
THE North-West Suburbs by-election
of a few years ago is still quoted as
an example of how the unknown
element may swing the vote against
known factors which would seem to favor
one particular candidate. It involved the
resignation of the Government, which
failed to retain the seat and its majority
in the House.
Gentlemen who, by a combination of
algebra and second-sight, purport to ex-
plain the vagariqs of the ballot need give
this particular mystery no further con-
sideration as a guide to future tactics.
The circumstances surrounding the
North-West Suburbs by-election were
unique and are not likely to be repeated.
The unknown element was Mr.
Michael McShane. Mr. McShane’s con-
fidential service for the removal of empty
bottles has brought surcease to many dis-
tracted citizens whose capacity for liquor
had outrun their discretion in disposing
of the containers. His case book con-
tains many records of his astuteness in
laying low these ghosts which have
brought their owners to a state of tremb-
ling fear and the verge of social disaster.
His activities in the North-West Suburbs
by-election provided no mean example ot
his capacity for organisation and clear
thinking.
Mr. McShane’s connection with the
election began with a visit to the Mc-
Shane Mercantile Exchange by Mr.
Albert Perker, the Radical party can-
didate. Mr. Perker’s career had been
picturesque. Of late he had been a
sori of envoy extraordinary, conduct-
ing varied delicate negotiations for
the Radical party with persons and organ-
isations with whom it was supposed, by
the rank and file, to have no truck.
“Hullo, McShane! Still saving sinners
from the consequences of their folly?”
was Mr. Perker’s greeting.
“Most of them must be brazening it
out,” rejoined Mr. McShane. “Maybe
you’ve come to relieve the monotony?”
“I have. As you know, I’m a candi-
date for North-West Suburbs. If I can
pull it off, our crowd stands a good
chance of being the Government, and,
as the man who took the winning trick,
I’ll expect to be provided for.”
Mr. McShane’s interest was aroused.
Here was an engagement that might well
lead to some fat fees.
“At any other time I wouldn’t care a
hoot about getting rid of dead marines
openly,” Mr. Perker explained, “but I
can’t afford to take chances now. North-
West Suburbs is a prim constituency, and
a cartload of empties leaving a candidate’s
home would be regarded as uncalled-for
flippancy by the most broad-minded resi-
dent, to say nothing of the Drys.”
“Why not leave them until after the
election?”
“Not safe. Grubble, the Government
candidate —you know, he’s a big shop-
keeper and property-owner—is kidding to
the cold-tea crowd (the local league’s sup-
posed to be the strongest in the State),
and I’ve got the office that he’s trying
to sool them on to me. They’ll probably
start calling at odd times. I can give
’em all the blarney they want, but I
couldn’t talk ’em blind to twenty dozen
empty bottles.”
“And you want to be rid of the bottles
as soon as possible, I take it?”
“Sooner the better, McShane. Get ’em
away without anybody waking up, and
you won’t find me ungrateful.”
Mr. McShane smiled appreciatively.
Here was a client who, unlike most of
them, presented his case without hys-
teria. The master bottle-oh had found
that once he was called in he was gener-
ally required to operate periodically. He
removed glass skeletons from family cup-
boards without rattling the bones.
“Give me your address, and I’ll be out
to-night,” said Mr. McShane briskly, his
mind already busy on the problem.
The Perker home was set in too
friendly proximity to its neighbors to
allow of any unusual evolutions being
performed without arousing curiosity.
Mr. McShane made a mental wager with
himself that if any bottle-oh of the com-
mon species had ever been misguided
enough to raise the cry of his trade in
Wattle-avenue, the disdainful silence
which followed had shattered his nerve.
There were only Mr. and Mrs. Perker
at home, the two Perker youngsters hav-
ing been sent to the talkies.
“Meet Mr. McShane, who holds as
many secrets as a family lawyer,” Perker
introduced Mrs. Perker. Despite her
lord’s assurances to the contrary, Mrs.
Perker had feared that the master bottle-
oh would arrive drunk, driving a dilapi-
dated horse and cart; whereas no
Wattle-avenue resident could justly criti-
cise either the McShane limousine or its
owner.
“You’ll think we’re terrible people, Mr.
McShane,” Mrs. Perker apologised ; “but,
really, the bottles are the accumulation
of years.”
“Not at all, ma’am ; not at all,” Mr.
McShane told her. “They’re the sort of
nuisance anybody’s liable to be troubled
with. Even if you didn’t mind getting
rid of them in the ordinary way, I’ll be
bound you’d never see a bottle-buyer
round here.”
Mr. McShane never used the term
“bottle-oh.” He believed in maintaining
the dignity of his business.
“The correct local method is to take
your empties (if you have any) in a suit-
case when you go away for the week-
end,” Mr. Perker informed him. “I had
an idea of saving mine as a nest-egg for
my old age, but they’ll have to go.”
A survey of the Perker political im-
pediments confirmed a tentative plan of
action which Mr. McShane had already
formed. As a preliminary, he and Mr.
Perker assembled the empties in a spare
room.
“ ’Tis some new furniture you’ll be
getting to-morrow, Mrs. Perker,” Mr.
McShane explained.
“But”
“At least, ’twill appear to the neighbors
to be new furniture, and they’ll also see
the old furniture going out. There’ll be
no change, really.”
“If you pull it off, and I win the elec-
tion, I’ll buy the missus a new suite,”
Mr. Perker declared.
“ ’Twould save a lot of explaining
later.” Mr. McShane had considered the
manoeuvre from all angles.
Mrs. Perker thought the plan an admir-
able one and Mr. McShane a gentle-
manly person. In that cordial atmosphere
the master bottle-oh took his leave.
Early next morning he was at work in
his property-room at the McShane Mer-
cantile Exchange. From among the
numerous ingenious gadgets there he
assembled what appeared to be a three-
piece lounge suite, swathed in dust-covers
—actually three large receptacles specially
fitted to hold numerous bottles in silent
security. These, and a sideboard with
similar internal arrangements, were
loaded into a covered lorry.
Mr. McShane, in overalls, climbed
aboard, followed by two employees, who
had been taken off their regular runs
in regions where, far from being an en-
cumbrance and a shameful secret, empty
bottles are part of the domestic budget.
“Now, don’t forget, boys, lift ’em out
heavy,” was Mr. McShane’s final admoni-
tion to his henchmen as they pulled up
in Wattle-avenue.
From the energy which Mr. McShane
and his assistants appeared to expend,
they were indeed substantial pieces of
furniture which were carried into the
Perker home, as several ladies in adjacent
houses observed from behind curtained
windows. The color scheme appeared
to be rose, so far as could be judged
from a small section which showed where
the dust-cover on the settee had parted.
That negligent glimpse of color —the
only bit on the whole “suite” —was one
of those details with which Mr. McShane
gave an artistic finish to his subterfuges.
Mr. Perker watched admiringly as the
bottles were packed into the dummy
suite and sideboard. Mrs. Perker felt
too much like an accessory to a crime to
appreciate the performance.
“With all respect, ma’am, ’tis the pre-
rogative of every woman to change her
mind,” said Mr. McShane ; “so the side-
board going out again won’t matter.
That’ll also help to explain another furni-
ture van calling if Mr. Perker wins the
seat.”
“It’ll be worth a factory full of furni-
ture,” asserted Mr. Perker. “How much
do I owe you for a neat bit of work?’
“We’ll leave that for a day or so,” Mr.
McShane replied. “I’ve got an idea we
may be able to round the business off
more completely.”
As Mr. McShane unfolded his plan
Mr. Perker chuckled. The candidate
promised to get certain information, and
make certain arrangements, as soon as
possible.
“What a head lost to politics!” Mr.
Perker murmured as he watched the
lorry move off, and noted the patch of
blue (the shade of Mrs. Perker’s lounge
suite) which peeped between the edges of
a dust-cover.
“Is Grubble going away for the week-
end?” Mr. McShane inquired when Mr.
Perker met him by appointment the fol-
lowing afternoon.
“He’s going down to their seaside cot-
tage after his meeting on Saturday night.
He’ll be there till Monday morning, when
he’ll go straight to his shop. The rest of

the family and the servants won’t return
home until the afternoon, as usual.”
“And you’ve got somebody you can
trust to do the preliminary work early
Monday morning?”
Mr. Perker assured him that he had,
and that the time-table of operations
drawn up by Mr. McShane would be
adhered to strictly.
Half an hour before dawn on Monday
morning a car pulled up outside the
spacious grounds surrounding Mr.
Grubble’s residence in Waratah-parade.
Two dark figures, each carrying a sack,
slipped unnoticed along the dark drive-
way almost to the house, which was out
of sight of the road. Behind a clump of
bushes they gently deposited their
burdens ; within a minute they were back
on the road, and the car had moved
quietly away.
At half-past nine o’clock Mr. Perker,
driving his own car, began to pick up a
number of influential electors whom he
had invited by letter to the Perker home
for morning tea and an informal dis-
cussion on the political situation. There
were the Rev. Mr. Tickner and Mrs.
Tickner, the Rev. Mr. Hibble, Miss
Agatha Murgatroyd-Jones and Mr. Eze-
kiah Dumfrey, all massive pillars in their
respective churches and militant officials
of the Anti-Liquor League.
“They’re worth three or four hundred
votes each if I can kid to them properly,
and things go according to schedule,” Mr.
Perker calculated as he drove his guests
towards home.
In Waratah-parade the even tenor of
the journey, and an enlightening discus-
sion in the back seat on the moral
dangers of public dance halls, were in-
terrupted by engine trouble. The car
came to an asthmatic standstill.
“i; ve been having a bit of trouble with
the ignition,” Mr. Perker apologised as
he got out to inspect the works.
“Isn’t that Mr. Grubble’s home oppo-
site?” remarked Mrs. Tickner.
“It is, my dear,” replied her husband;
“and a very substantial place, too.”
“We could do with more solid busi-
ness men like Mr. Grubble,” declared
Mr. Dumfrey. “It would”
He broke off, and stared in shocked
wonder at the vehicle which was non-
chalantly turning into the Grubble drive.
The other members of the party, with
the exception of Mr. Perker, who was
busy under the bonnet screwing and un-
screwing various nuts, followed Mr.
Dumfrey’s gaze.
There was no mistaking the industry in
which the caller to the Grubble home
was engaged. Mr. McShane, who was
driving the outfit, had chosen the most
unashamedly plebeian turn-out from his
transport lines—a low-slung coster’s
barrow, which set the half-dozen bottles
on it chuckling at every step the pony
took. Mr. McShane, in his oldest
clothes and wearing a battered derby
above an unshaven face, proceeded up
the drive with confident familiarity.
“Bottles!” gasped Miss Murgatroyd-
Jones. “Bottles!”
“That will show you the wickedness
and deceit of human nature,” said the
Rev. Hibble. “And I thought Grubble
was a good-living man.”
“And to flaunt his sin like that!” ex-
claimed Mrs. Tickner.
Mr. Tickner and Mr. Dumfrey, view-
ing the affair more in the light of prac-
tical politics, thanked Providence that
the lamb’s fleece had fallen from the
wolf’s hide before polling-day.
Rapidly securing the two bags of
empty bottles, part of Mr. Perker’s col-
lection, which had been planted earlier
in the day, Mr. McShane stacked them in
impudent array on the cart, and drove
back to the roadway.
“Wanted tenpence a dozen this time,
did he, the dirty skinflint?” Mr. McShane
hiccoughed, loud enough for the Anti-
Liquor Leaguers to hear. “Giddap, yer
lazy cow, till we see if there’s a pub in
this dump.”
“Do you think we ought to question
him?” Mrs. Tickner suggested.
“Very unwise, my dear, very unwise ”
said Mr. Tickner. “The fellow would
probably use dreadful language.”
Mr. McShane drove on down the road
singing “Pickle My Bones in Alcohol.”
“Mr. Grubble’s place? Dear me, how
disgusting!” Mr. Perker commented.
Well, we can be moving, anyway ■ the
car’s fixed.”
“I think a change to a more edifying
atmosphere would indeed be agreeable ”
Mr. Hibble’s tone set Mr. Perker making
tentative calculations of his majority.
Two days after his election as mem-
ber for North-West Suburbs Mr Perker
rang Mr. McShane.
“My cheque satisfactory?” he asked
Quite. What’s the prospects in that
other matter?”
“That contract for the exclusive right
to collect empties from all Government
property, McShane? It’ll g 0 through for
you as soon as we take over.”
A MEMORY OF MORBECQUE.
BY HAMER.
MORBECQUE was brought into the
war when the dent was made in
the northern part of the British
line by the German thrust of March,
1918. As with all other French villages,
the war had drained its manhood; but
the troop trains which carried their
freights through to the junction at Haze-
brouck had swept by, leaving the little
hamlet in its peace. Then the tide of
mixed soldiery suddenly flooded into
its streets and thronged its estaminets.
Morbecque was in the war.
It was still untouched when a section
of us reached the place on special
duty, after being raced north from
Amiens and doing a spell on the Bailleul-
Meteren railway track which checked the
German push. Billeted in the school-
house, we pronounced Morbecque a
home, and hoped that it would stay that
way until we had done with it.
But on the morning of the second day
Fritz presented his card. It was a glori-
ous spring day ; the air was like wine,
and here and there little flowers showed
against the green of the grass. But
into the peacefulness came the sharp
nnihriKt 0 Af fdllln S shGll > th ? geyser-like
upthrust of a fountain of earth and
smoke, the roar of an explosion. An-
other shell sang spitefully overhead, and
the metallic clang showed that it had
exploded in the village—probably on the
cobbles of the main street.
Our working parties scattered. I paused
on seeing a little boy standing in what
might be a danger zone, his blue eyes
open wide, but his expression more one
of wonder than of fear. Hurrying towards
him, I held out my hand. He immedi-
ately put his little hand in mine.
The shells seemed to be falling on the
other side of the village ; so instead of
waiting I led the youngster towards his
home, the direction of which he had indi-
cated with a pointing finger. He was
glad to have me with him. But there was
no conversation, because I found it diffi-
cult to understand his childish French,
and I expect mine was worse to him.
Ormsby uprose from his cover under
a hedge in the little hedge-bound lane.
“S’pose Fritz has let up,” he remarked;
‘‘but he’ll shell like hell to-night. Where’d
you pick up the kid?”
I told him.
“Cripes, it gets on a man’s nerves the
way these Frenchies hang on when they
oughter move out at the toot,” Ormsby
said. “Fancy a kid like this—bonzer
little kid, too —being kept here where any
moment a shell might get him.”

“I’m going to speak to his mother and
urge her to get out before to-night,
I said. ,
“Do,” Ormsby replied ; “but she won t
go.”
The boy broke from us and ran to a
buxom, good-looking woman who stood
in the doorway of a little rustic cottage.
She carried a baby against her breast.
Her skirts were clutched by the hands of
another child.
After talking volubly to the boy, the
woman thanked us in the pretty way the
peasant women have. In my stumbling
French I implored her to leave the vil-
lage. Ormsby joined in; he was able to
make himself more intelligible.
“But no,” she said. “It is the home of
my Francois, and when he comes back
he will expect to find me.”
We continued the argument, without
moving her. She was proud of her
Francois. Francois had had an accident
and an illness just before the war, and,
being unfit for service, was put on other
work in which he might have remained.
But Francois wanted to fight for France ;
and at last he had been accepted. And
he would expect his Jeannette to be in the
home he had made for her. He would
find her waiting.
“Is Francois at home now?” demanded
Ormsby suddenly.
He was looking intently past into the
grey of the house interior; and his ques-
tion and attitude startled her.
“No, no!” she said. t
“Well, who is that-in 1 the house? The
soldier with the wounded arm and the
bandaged breast?” he asked.
With the arm that was not holding the
baby she grasped his, staring along the
line of his gaze.
“I cannot see! ” she cried excitedly.
“Is he a tall man with a leetle moustache
—black? And a red scar along his
cheek?”
“Yes,” assented Ormsby again.
“Oh, it is my Franqois! It is my .Fran-
cois!” she cried. “What has happened
to him? Why can I not see him?”
I had been looking on curiously ; and
as I, like the woman, could see nothing,
I wondered at Ormsby’s game. I thought
I knew when he spoke again.
“He seems to be waving you away—
out of this house —to be asking us to
take you away,” he said. “It is as if he
is worried by your being here.”
“No! No!” she sobbed. “It is be-
cause he is afraid that I shall leave his
house —the house in which every wall is
dear because of him.”
Ormsby dashed into the house, paused
irresolutely, and then came back. In my
heart I applauded his good acting, realis-
ing that his purpose was good ; and, with
him, I again tried to induce the woman
to leave the village. All in vain.
Ormsby shrugged his shoulders as we
left. Presently I wanted him to go back.
“Tell her that tale about your seeing her
husband was just a trick,” I said. “It
has upset her.”
“You don’t think I saw anything?”
“Of course not!”
“How did I describe her man then?”
“You didn’t. You just answered the
words in which she described him.”
He stood stock-still and looked at me ;
then he walked ahead. When I made
some further remark he turned the con-
versation completely.
There was a pay-parade that afternoon,
and wine was bought in large quantities.
As the evening darkened the estaminets
became more crowded; and, enjoying
myself, I forgot the Frenchwoman and
her children.
In twos and threes the roysterers wan-
dered through the pitch-dark street back
to their billets., Silence gradually settled
on the village.
The storm of. iron arrived. Our first
intimation was when the building shook,
the concussion throwing some of us who
were carelessly balanced to the floor. The
air became acrid with,, a rush of gas.
Came a nightmare of tumult in which
the scream of shells, the crashes and
thuds, and the spatter and rattle of fall-
ing metal and bricks all mixed.
I thought of the woman and her child-
ren, and dashed through the streets,
whose darkness was torn only by the
flashes of shell explosions, or by the
ghastly gleam that a heated shell some-
times threw as it sped overhead. The
totter and fall of housefronts in the
pitchy black was horrible. Civilians were
rushing out of their homes, many drag-
ging household goods or personal belong-
ings they had hastily gathered. Soldiers
were helping them.
As I neared Jeannette’s house a man
came running alongside. Ormsby. We
both paused with dismay when, turning
into the little by-way which led to the
cottage, we saw light before us—the
changing, unequal light of flames.
In a moment we saw it was not from
the dwelling we sought. Another had
been hit, and was on fire.
We hurried on, and found the woman,
carrying her baby, and with the two
children beside her. Beside her, too, were
two large bundles, each caught into a
sheet. The boy was manfully trying to
get one over his shoulder; his mother
had dropped hers to try to help him.
“How the hell did she get those to-
gether?” muttered Ormsby. “Oh, these
damned French people!”
“Here, we’ll take the kids,” I said, pick-
ing up the little boy. “Leave the bundles
—we’ll come back for those for you.”
“He came to me to-night,” I heard her
sob. “I saw him this time. He woke me
up, and told me to go. I had only just
gathered these things to take when—
when it started. But, oh, I do not know
what has happened to him! ”
We were too busy with our loads, too
anxious to get her out of danger, to make
any comment. She had whispered her
words and did not speak again.
We had not advanced more than a few
paces when there was a tearing crash.
I heard the woman behind me sob.
“What’s wrong? Is she hit?” 1 whis-
pered—for the inclination to whisper
fearfully came to us all.
“Her cottage is gone—that’s all,”
Ormsby’s voice threw forward to me. 1
looked half-round and saw, beside the
flames of the still-burning house, the
“dirt” falling where the cottage should
have been.
There was a sudden roar in the lane
ahead of us. I threw myself and the
child sideways into the hedge and down-
ward to cover; and some flying stones
and pieces of shell-case rained about us.
But this shell, so far away from the vil-
lage centre, was merely a “stray,” and
more were unlikely. Still, we could not
leave the woman alone with her children.
We made a cut across the fields
—difficult and troublesome with our
loads —and gained the main road from
the village again. Here, in a long line
under the hedge, the refugees were
camped, waiting for the morning; but
the oppression of silence was so much
upon them still that we were almost
treading on them before we knew that
they were there.
We found a space for our charges,
and as we dumped our loads, both the
children and the bundles, the mother sank
to the ground and, letting her head sink
into her hands, burst into subdued sobs.
“What is it? What’s the matter?”
asked Ormsby sympathetically.
“My Francois! My Francois!” she
sobbed.
A shadow crept close to her.
“Is it Mathilde?” it whispered. “It is
Sophie here. Oh, Mathilde, I have lost
my daughter! She must be killed. We
cannot find her!”
We were glad to get away. We left
them some bully-beef and biscuits we
had in our haversacks, saying we had
more work to do. There was plenty more
to and weak villagers staggering
under absurd loads to find a place to
rest. In the course of these duties Ormsby
and I were parted.
I realised that what I regarded as
Ormsby’s imposture had impressed the
woman into imagining visions herself;
but I was so intrigued about the soldier
he said he had seen that all the time I
had been wanting to question him about
it. I felt he had given Jeannette an
unnecessary belief that 1 her husband had
come to harm, and that he ought to
explain to her;.
The bombardment faded out, and,
except for the crash of some tottering
wall, quiet came to Morbecque—the
quiet of ruin and desolation. I wan-
dered back into the deserted village,
making my way into the estaminets,
where the wine was unattended. In some
of them soldiers were taking advantage of
the free drinks.
Dawn had come when, moved by an
unaccountable attraction, I stood before
the cottage whose inhabitants we had
assisted to safety. It was a pathetic
wreck now. As I stared‘ at it the cure
came near and stared at it too.
“There were a woman and three poor
little children in that house,” he said
nervously. “I”
“They are safe,” I said. “I can show
you where they are, if you wish.”
“You can, m’sieur? If you would!”
he said thankfully. “I have a message for
the mother —about her husband.”
“Something has happened to him? He
is a soldier,” I said.
“He has been shot.”
“Is he dead?” I asked intently.
“No, m’sieur. He has been badly
wounded in the arm and chest.”
“He will live, then?”
“He can fight no more, but he will
live!”
As with joy in my heart I led the cure
on his mission to still the sorrow of a
soldier’s wife and give her back the
father of her children, I heard a black-
bird singing.
But I was never able to tell Ormsby
the rest of the story or question him
about his vision. He was hurt that morn-
ing ; and I never saw him again.

NEVER REALLY ILL - YET NEVER REALLY FIT
I
\Em
We all know that “half - and - half” feeling. Not
downright ill —yet far from well. That feeling which
comes on Mondays, after an indiscreet week-end. You
get it, too, with certain winds, and at the change of
the seasons.

When buying be sure and
get DR. MORSE’S
INDIAN ROOT PILLS,
which are enclosed in this
familiar blue wrapper.
Often you get it without any
apparent reason. You are a bore
to yourself and a nuisance to
others, and life seems to have
something missing. The trouble
may be trivial — it may be
serious, but in either case it is
Nature’s warning, so take heed
in time.
You will be pleasantly
surprised with the improvement
which follows a dose or, better still, a course of Dr.
Morse’s Indian Root Pills. The recognised medicine for
Life’s Little Ills. They stir the Liver, correct Biliousness,
Indigestion, and Constipation, and thus tone up the
system.

PILLS
WORMS
A COMMON COMPLAINT WITH
CHILDREN—HOW TO TREAT IT
Worms, by their movements and the
interruption they offer to the contents
of the Bowels, generally occasion pain
or uneasiness in the Abdomen, some-
times spasmodic, sometimes gnawing
and biting, and not infrequently of a
vague, indescribable character, and yet
very distressing. Sympathetic with this
is a sensation of itching at the nostrils,
producing a disposition to pick the Nose,
which is characteristic of the affection.
The Bowels are often disordered, some-
times relaxed, as in Dysentery. The
appetite is exceedingly variable ; in some
cases natural; in others deficient, craving
or depraved, one condition not infre-
quently alternating with another. The
Abdomen is often hard, swollen and tym-
panetic, the breath heavy or foetid, and
tongue furred, with disagreeable taste, and
a copious flow of saliva; swelling of the
upper lip, bleeding of the nostrils and
disposition to grind the teeth during the
sleep are other characteristic symptoms.
The effects, however, often extend be-
yond the Alimentary Canal, and various
derangements of health are experienced
in consequence, either of the direct irri-
tation of the worms or of the disordered
digestion which they occasion. Among
the most common of these are nervous
affections such as fretfulness, irritation of
temper, wakefulness or disposition to ex-
cessive sleep, disturbed sleep, sudden
starting out of sleep, as if from fright,
dizziness, spasmodic movements of the
eyelids, temporary blindness and deaf-
ness. General convulsions are not infre-
quent in children also.
Unfortunately, many mothers fail to
recognise the fact that their little ones
are suffering intense pain and distress,
and are practically irresponsible for the
outbursts of temper, restlessness and
peevishness, and until some more serious
symptoms appear nothing is done to
alleviate the distress. The symptoms of
this disease are somewhat variable, but
generally they are so characteristic that
no mother need have any doubts. The
best proof of worms is worms, and if
the general conduct of the child is such
as to give the slightest suspicion a care-
ful watch will afford ample proof.
A child who is affected with Thread
Worms Will often appear to the eye to be
in an indifferent state of health. It
becomes peevish and irritable in its
temper. Another point to which the
attention of mothers should be specially
directed is that the child is apt to start
in its sleep, its repose being in the way of
a disturbed nature.
Comstock’s “Dead Shot” Worm Pellets
are a purely vegetable medicinal pre-
paration, compounded on a scientific
principle for the eradication of worms
which infest the Intestines. They contain
specific properties which destroy the
worms but cause no injury to the
Stomach or Bowels, and do not weaken
the system. The pellets are prepared in
the form of a confection or lolly, have no
disagreeable taste or smell, but, on the
contrary, inspire children to take them
as they would an ordinary sweet.
