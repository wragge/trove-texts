Ugly Names.
People do wrong to be frightened by phrases.
The first movement of the mind, on pereeiving
that any speaker or writer clinches on au argu-
ment by an appeal to prejudice, should be to con-
sider in what degree the prejudice appealed to is
worthy of endorsement. It is very common, Tor
example, to find a policy or a suggestion con-
demned by simply remarking that it would lead to
anarchy, or that its tendency is Communistic or
Socialistic. In a case of this sort, if the implica-
tion is reasonably supported by appearances,
most people accept the demonstration as con-
clusive against the proposal which will involve
these horrors. We were about to write “ these
nameless horrors,” but that would have been
incorrect, although convoying our meaning.
Strictly speaking, Communism, Socialism, and
Anarchy are, nob nameless, and not even idealesa
Bnt the mention of them conveys an imperfect
and insufficient idea, and one which is conre-
quently apt to De a false idea. Popularly, Com-
munism is understood merely aar» system for a
forcible redistribution of property, and is coloured
with the reflection of the flames of burning Paris.
Socialism, again, is imagined as a twin-brother of
Communism, with all tbs repulsive features en-
larged, and a lot of badness added While
Anarchy is mere diabolism —a sort of devilish
chaos, such as existed before the Almighty evolved
order. In fact, order being constantly preached
up as of Divine creation, Anarchy, its opposite,
is regarded as necessarily Satanic.
• * *
To anyone who takes the trouble to investigate,
it becomes immediately apparent that every one
of these ideas is fallacious. Neither Communism
nor Socialism are more frantic schemes for de-
struction. Neither of the systems—for they are
systems—ia comprehended in a sheer incitement
to bum palaces, kill archbishops, and baud over
property to be looted by “ the dangerous classes.”
a hat they are so regarded ia attributable chiefly
to the 'unscrupulous misrepresentation of in-
terested parties. The Press organs of the pri-
vileged and wealthy orders, and the occupants of
pulpits, are never weary of describing these social
systems of reform in terms which shall excite re-
pugnance and disgust. Thus the Roman Catholic
i •Halford, the other day, pronounced
j. , doctrines are the outcome
t s a u' S t 0a0 king,” and defines these teachings
w bo wholesale robbery and confiscation ; terror-
ism, incendiarism, violence, murder, and im-
morality. To people who are content to receive
''‘formation in a digested form, and at second hand,
statement of this kind settles the whole of the
inestions involved in Socialism and Communism
and ur t' 10r ado. Unless the Bishop bo a liar
“mndBret, or incapable of comprehending
V, a “ “ e undertakes to expound—that is to say, a

B „? y ““'■nolic who has not made a study of the

ombodv tha PU or yfotfl 0 to rapine. They
, r ,f. honings and conclusions of deep
8 thinkers, whose reflections had been
concentrated upon the anomalies presented by the
structure and organization of modern society.
The principles thus evolved by patient study
and reflection have been embodied in numer-
ous treatises, which no antagonism or repug-
nance have been able to degrade to the
level of whimsical fancies or impracticable ab-
surdities. Scarcely regarded at first, such works
are daily rising into importance and respect. Even
in quarters where the doctrines embodied in them
are most deprecated and contemned, the ability
and earnest convictions of their authors are ad-
mitted. But what is most significant ia the fact
that, while the privileged and protected classes
everywhere refer to these doctrines with a con-
temptuous disdain which is fast merging into an
irritated apprehension, the masses throughout the
civilised world—that is to say, the Continent of
Europe—are everywhere adopting the theories
with an avidity, eagerness, and rapidity which
absolutely surpasses the similar spread, during
tho second and third centuries of our reckoning,
of tho Christian religion. It is merely requisite
to refer to late advices by cable to bear out this
comparison. Russia, Prance, Germany, Italy,
Spain, and Ireland—all the countries, in fact,
where the assumed rights of tho privileged classes
have pressed most heavily upon the masses—are
simultaneously in volcanic motion ; and it is but
yesterday that tho chief among tho representa-
tives of privilege—the Czar of Russia —proposed
to the governing powers of the other States com-
bined action to repress tho universal agitation.
The similarity in respect of rapid diffusion, which
is noted between Socialism and Primitive Chris-
tianity, may, perhaps, be asoribablo to an identity
of attraction. Each system professes to offer
social equality. Interpreted by the poor and
oppressed, tha tenets of Christ promised exactly
what are by the same class presumed to be tne
inducements of Socialistic and Communistic
theories. There were to be no more rich, and no
more oppression. Brotherhood and love were to
prevail over the earth. The lion and the lamb were
to lie down together. By an easy corruption of
reasoning in each instance, the ignorant, the im-
petuous, or the designing distort the divine
features of such anticipations into justification
for heaping swift destruction upon the heads of
all who stand in the way.
* « «
Socialism has many enemies. Monarohs, High
Priests, and meu rich beyond their deserving are
determined, because interested, enemies. But the
worst foes are those who oppose or those who
favour the reforms without comprehending their
scope or purport. The systems would have more
real friends were they more generally studied.
The fullest comprehension of the principles
of the philosophy could add nothing to the ani-
mosity of those who hate it instinctively, while it
would abate the damaging enthusiasm of those
who instinctively applaud it. As for Anarchy, that
terrible word ia robbed of half its terrors and half
its potency to quash an argument when people
recognise that anarchy is often but a necessary
stepping stone to higher order. “ Anarchy !” said,
in February last, Mr. Courtney, a member of Mr.
Gladstone’s Government —“Are the Liberal
party to be afraid of anarchy? Anarchy often
means the beginning of good government, tho throes
of a new birth, the pangs of a new order.”
PLAIN ENGLISH.
A Cheeky Colonial.
Our neighbours in Queensland are certainly blessed, or
cursed, with the most enterprising Prime Minister who
ever held office in Australasia. The little handful of
Britous who constitute the population of Queensland
are perpetually being invited by Sir Thomas MTlwraith
to lend tbeir countenance to some undertaking which
appears vastly disproportionate to their strength.
There generally ensues,, after such proposition emerges
from the teeming brain of Sir Thomas, a period of
stupefaction. The people ho presides over are stunned
by his confounding audacity. Presently, somebody in
opposition—generally Mr. Griffith— announces that
confounding audacity is but another term for con-
founded impudence, and sets to work to prove that
what is proposed is impossible of accomplishment. We
know of no undertaking more congenial to a narrow and
unimaginative intelligence than demonstrating tha*
everything is impossible which he has been incapable
of conceiving. The next stage in Queensland has
ordinarily been that Sir Thomas MTlwraith has
entered into details, and has shown that by some
combination which the demonstrator of impossibility
had never thought of, the impossible is not only possible
but easy. Such a demonstration generally evokes „
burst of admiration, during the continuance of which
objection is useless. But as soon as excitement sub-
sides, the apostles of the impossible are discovered to
be hard at work again, on changed ground, labouring to
show that, though possible, the feat would not be at-
tended with any advantage. This sequence has prevailed
in the matter of the gigantic scheme for a Trans-Aus-
tralian Eailway projected by Sir Thomas MTlwraith,
and in reference to the separate direct mail service which
he arranged for his little community. It will, doubtless,
ba repeated with respect to his latest and most audaci-
ous enterprizo—the annexation of New Guinea by tha
colony of Queensland. This is quite a new departure.
That a dependency should assume Imperial functions,
and undertake to annex a territory nearly as large as
and more populous than its own, is probably unprece-
dented, especially considering that the territory to be
annexed lies beyond sea, and distant more than a thou-
sand miles from the seat of government in the
annexing colony. The singularity of the adventure
is all the more striking because the annexors have
neither a navy nor an army, and possess
no apparent resources in men or money to make good
their enterprise should the strong hand be required by
eventual contingencies. It is difficult to comprehend
what Queensland can want New Guinea for. The only
reason we have seen alleged for her moving in that
direction is that some Power is sure to appropriate the
portion not claimed by the Dutch before long, and that
it will be undesirable to have an appanage of a foreign
and probably aggressive nation planted within cooey of
Australia. But this reasoning is obviously fallacious.
The Australian continent is self-contained, and sea-
girt. By extending Australasian dominion to New
Guinea, there will be created the very condition which,
according to the argument, it is desirable to avoid.
Queensland will proceed to * meet the undesirable
foreigner half-way, and will plant herself in New
Guinea alongside of the Dutch claimants, with merely
a political line for frontier and boundary. Sir Thomas
MTlweaith’s mode of setting to work is as startling as
the work ho undertakes. Ho invites the approval of
the Imperial authorities, it ia true; but at the same
time he Daves no room for mistaking that he does so as
a matter of form. In fact, ha is simultaneously taking
action —a course really equivalent to first annexing
New Guinea and afterwards asking leave.
The Rebel Boers.
The Boers ought to be the next marks for pseudo-
patriotic defamation. They refuse to vacate Tembu-
land, and are massing their forces on that frontier.
This attitude is characterised as “menacing.” Now for
a tine indiscriminating lot of scolding. Thus : The
Boers, elated by casual successes gained over mere
detachments of our troops, have assumed an arrogance
of demeanour which will best bo abated by allowing
them to feel the full strength of the arms of Great
Britain. It is to be hoped that there will be no more
shuttling and parleying, but that a sufficient body of all
arms, under a competent leader—although the task o
whipping these braggart Dutchmen is unworthy of ou
greatest Generals —will be dispatched to make short
work with them, and reduce them to proper subjection.
Their refusal to quit Tombuland is a piece of effrontery
only paralleled by their impertinence in making a
military demonstration to support their iniquitous
pretensions to a portion of British territory. Humph 1
That’s about the regular thing, isn’t it ? Well, before
we quite commit ourselves to a burst of virtuous
indignation, it may be just as well to wait till we find
out first where the dickens Tembuland is; secondly,
who really can show the best claim to have been first
to steal it from the natives ; and, thirdly, whether the
“ attitude" of the Boors is really “ menacing" and not
defensive. A first-rate plan in all contentious is to
hear both sides. The allegation that the Boers have
assumed a “menacing attitude” is the case for the
prosecution. The case for the defence—that is to say,
the explanation of the Boers—may happen to be that
their forces are Only massed in response to a prior
demonstration and movement of our troops. In that
event, the cable message should properly have been
headed “Menacing attitude of the British.” Wait 1
The Secret of Slaveydom.
The secret of the scarcity of servants in this country
is that the girls of this country are frequently fools.
Wo mean the girls who should till such positions. This
l s not their fault altogether. Their parents are partly
to blame for net instilling into them the idea that
honest work is never dishonourable, and that it is
better in the sight of everybody for them to be respect,
able domestics than draggle-tailed demireps. But
their parents seem to be proud of the music-hall airs
and graces «f their daughters. This mongrel fashion-
ableuess seems to the bricklayer father and the wa.-htr-
woman mother very elegant style indeed. And, of
course, a girl who goes prancing about on high-heeled
boots with her hair hanging over her eyes, and her hat
on the side of her head, and her train gathering up tha
tobacco-spittle on the side path, and whom the other
Joolyebs or Mariaes allude to as “their young lady
friend,” could hardly be expected to descend to wash-
ing dishes. No, and “A Factory Girl,” writing to the

prise that many “young ladies” prefer the factory to

Respectability and Honesty.
The Adelaide Advertise a has administered a reproof
to ns on the deoorum of our Legislature. The Advbe
tisuu, it may bo remarked in passing, appears desirous
to assume the part of censor of Australian manner
and morals. The paper named, which is not in any
tr ie sense a representative Australian newspaper, is 11
fitted for such a position as it aspires to All 5 it is too
distinctly marked with what Abhold, following Dr.
KiwsiiJi calls, •• the note of provinciality." We in
New South Wales, however, see the matter in a different
light. We know that no man dares open his month
against the political »nd religious and social shams and
humbugs which encompass us, unless he be sheltered
behind the privilege of Parliament, It Is true that
iometimos a worthy man may get hardly handled, but a
good reputation can survive parliamentary discussion.
Kot so with a bad one, however, for that subsists on
eredlt, on praise of all the churches, on paragraphs In
newspapers, and on popular ignorance and indifference;
and so soon as the eyes of the people are opened, they
aea the sham and tread it under foot. The arguments
•n which our legislature is denounced aro—1. 'lhat the
bad form prevailing there prevents good men from
entering the public arena ; and, 2, that this bad form
brings the Parliament into disrepute. As to number one
an we have to say Is, if a man is too thin-skinned
to face and bear trial of his honesty and public spirit,
let him stay without the Parliament, and allow a firmer
spirit to fill the place. And as to number two, let us
remind the 'Tiskh, which is pious, of the whited sepul-
chre, tall of dead men’s bones. There la a respecta-
bility which la mediocre, which is smug, which is
silent and complacent while rogues rob the treasury ;
and It la this respectability which will more surely
bring Parliament into contempt than all the Taylors
and M’Elhones who may ever enter its walls.
Judges’ Pensions.
T HER b | 8 a certain Greek proverb, which we com-
mend to the attention of certain not disinterested
persons: it ia “flee avarice." The occasion for
this advice is the introduction of a Bill to provide
for the increase of Jadges’ salaries and pensions. In
that Bill was a clause which, on Friday night, wa>
rejected on technical grounds, and which provided that
the pensions of retired Judges of the Supreme Court
should be increased as well as those which will here-
after become dus to the present J udges on completion
of the allotted term of service. We have not seen any
argument to convince ns that this increase Is equitable
Bo far from that, we believe the clause has been got
Into the Bill by underhand influence; that the Minister,
who is a yielding man, has in this case yielded to
the pressing advice cf an interested person. It
is generally a bad policy to trust a member of a
society to confer increased privileges and advantages
upon hie own order. But, quite irrespective of the ques-
tion whether increased wage* will secure for ns the bast
Judges, seeing as we - do that a judgeship is now a politi-
cal prize, we feel bound to demur to the proposition o f
raising the pensions of retired Judges. Did they not
take the wages offered at the time of their appointment
and the retiring allowance f Now that the work has
grown heavier and more responsible, because weighter
matters are at issue, and the salaries of the recent and
future Judges are to be increased, it is sheer impudence
and avarioe to desire an advance of their own pensions.
Once again, venerable persons, wo advise you flee
avarice, the vice of old age.
A Flash of Light
TitE Australian Qas Light Company arc successfully
sneaking a private Bill through Parliament empowering
them to increase their capital, and relieving them en-
tirely from the restriction as to holding freehold estate,
which till now they have been subjected to. It was
only a year ago that the absolute necessity of putting
thie monopoly under the curb was in everybody’s
mouth. The Company had been convicted of cozening
consumers by using false meters. They were subject
to no check as to the quality of their gas, and they were
at liberty to enforce the most monstrous claim, in case
of any dispute, by refusing to supply their adversai y I
with light, although he might have a hundred pounds
worth of gas-fittings in his house. To give an
idea of the enormous and arbitrary power wielded
by this of* may, we may just adduce one example.
The motive power used in The Bulletin office is a gai-
engine, which works all onr machinery. The office ia
illuminated with gas. Now, it is absolutely within tie
power of the Qas Company to out off out supply, dc.
prive na of power and light, and inflict upon ns the
expense of new fittings for oil lamps and of replacing
the gas-engine with a steam-engine, as a penalty for
daring to thus expose their little game. We had, ic.
deed, expected that a Qas Company BiU would have
been introduced this session. But we looked for a Bill
which would have provided for the protection of the
public, and for proper tests of the quality of light suf •
plied. Instead of that, here we have an impudent Bill
slipping through Parliament to increase the powers of
the monopoly and relieve the Company ol about the
only restraint which prevents it coming omnipotent,
backed up as it is by numbering the proprioters of the
S.M. Herald among its principal shareholders.
"Evening News” Logic!
As the fact seems to be established that there has been
a falling off in the number of matriculants at the
University this year compared with last year’s returns,
there has been an attempt made to account for this in a
quarter where interest in University culture and
University work was least to be expected. And the
hy pothesis put forth to account for the (act j ust referred
to is that because the authorities at G.-ose Farm give
their information to the Heru-d and ignore other
media, therefore, there is mi management. It does
not follow. Let not th se be di omraged who wish to
■ee the art* that soften and refine studied in New South
Wales, as wall as those that lead to wealth. There are
•auses at work which prevent the University from
attaining Its full measure of influence at present, and
whiah may operate for years to come. In the first
place, there needs to be a large leisured class in the
community before the classes at the University
oan be filled; for the men that are working
(or their daily bread, cannot be expected te be very
solicitous about the advantages of literary culture.
Again, there must be a general sense of the need of
such culture before men consent to pay a large sum
for tuition, and set aside their children to spend years
in the acquisition of the training which a well equipped
University offers. And, in a community which is de.
voted to money-getting, which mikes its highest sena-
torial honours a reward for mere wealth, which finds its
[esthetic needs satisfied by tea-meetings and cricket
matches and horse races, such a sense is a plant of slow
growth. Again, the want of proper High Schools in
country centres is felt. No University can prosper
unless it have a stream of qualified matriculants ; and
how can it have this when the country, outside the
metropolis, and even in the metropolis Itself, is very
ooorly supplied with what can be honestly called good
secondary schools ? When the pr omised High Schools
are in full operation, things will be better at the Uni-
varsity.
Clerical Conservatism.
Thfrb Is no man so consei'vative as jour olerie. There
is no man who has so mnch reason to be so. Each
(Ihurch mast profess to hare the patent of saltation,
Just as each dealer in a particular article—wiy soaf—
must claim to sell the only genuine brand. If not, that
church loses. But no church ever loses. No church is
such an ass. The Rev. Mr. of Melbourne,
was, therefore, perfectly consistent in objecting, the
other Sunday, to the interchange of pulpits between
Rev. Dr. Brombt and Rev. Charles Stron». It would
be absurd to allow the canvasser of the rival firm which
deals in Salvation to come into the established ehurch
and announce to the congregation that he could supply
them with the real thing. We wonder what the con.
gregation thought. They did not appear to have many
objections. But wo wonder still more what “ Provi-
dence " thought. Possibly it did not think anything at
all. Both of the reverend gentlemen in question, we
may mention incidentally, are very crooked on tradi-
tional doctrine. The Reverend Charles is always in
hot water with his congregation, and the Reverend
Doctor says openly that four-fifths of his were sent into
this world for the specific object of being damned. And
probably he is right j but it is not cheerful for the four-
fifths. He has a theory of divine eclecticism which
argues that only intellectual men will be saved. Of
course Dr. Brombv is an intellectual man. We like
this theory. It will be a new Joy to us when we are
rattling off an Army hymu upon a golden harp s trung
with the intestines of libel Jurors to know that wa shall
never see again our brothers of the daily press. We
will put a case to conclude with. The Rev. Dr.
QregorT claims that his church only knows the way to
Heaven. Very well, if he should happen to die before
the Reverend Charles will ho object to his boiug
admitted into Heaven 7 He mult do so if he does not
want to own up that ha was wrong all his life. And, if
ha is like most other clerics, he would ba damued
before he would do this. So Mr. Strong will have a
boisterous time in the next world as well as in this.

Whenever any unlettered quack artfully manages to
get his name noticed in a S.M. Herald paragraph, the
guileless conductors of that humorous publication in-
variably allude to him as “ Doctor 11 Brown, or
“Doctor" Jobson, as the caso may be. lu this
respect the Herald people seem to have been designed
by a beneficent Providence as instruments for the
encouragement of impudeut imposture. ■ lu its news
columns the Herald is continually accrediting with
the possession of medical degrees and diplomas vulgar
humbugs, who know ns much about medicine and
anatomy as the hangman knows about classics and the
binomial theorem,—persons whose names should never
be pronounced, save at midnight in a skull-strewa
graveyard, ana whose “ monnikers " should only appear
in print side by side with n death’s head and cross-
bones. The Herald is reminded that there still exists
in New South Wales such a thing as a Register of
Qualified Practitioners, and that a brass plate, however
inscribed, doesn’t give a man the slightest knowledge
of the complex machinery of the human body. In New
South Wales you have only to assume a white tie and
shave your upper lip, and you’re qualified to make a
man ready for Heaven. And if you buy a brass plate
with “Doctor" on it, and get a news par. in the
“leading Journal," confirming the announcement made
on the metallic emblem of your face, you’re ready to
se.>.d people to another and a better world tight away.
We strongly object to this kind of deception. When
one or two things occur, we hope to have the pleasure
of publishing in this paper a complete list of all the
unqualified impostors practising medicine in Sydney.
Meanwhile, we shall he very glad to set correspondents
right as to the qualifications of a lot of the crawlers on
whom the Herald, which ought to know better,
confers the honourable title of “ Doctor.”

down the American champion), beat W. Franks in a one-

cramps iduring the race, and Baby eased up. Had the

Perhaps Oebhardt was not so much to blame
after all. The article about him and Mrs. Langtry,
written by Cunningham, was outrageous. However,
Gebbardt. accepted the offer to fight with pistols,
altbongh he “ couldn’t shoot :** but Just as he had
written the note, Mrs. L. tapped at h : s door, and coming
in, after a long entreaty, persuaded him not to fight,
but t® apologise for her sake The Dramatic Times
says “ The treatment of Mrs. Langtry t>j u>e daily
press of Chicago and St. Lonis transcends in vulgarity
and oow&rcioe anything ever attempted in this country.
In Chicago the reporters stole her private conrospon.
deuce; they forced themselves into her apartmett. and
they wrote about her private affairs in a ruthlessly im-
pudent manner. However feeble Mrs. Langtry may
be as an actress, she is entitled to seme considera-
tion as a woman, and so would the veriest wanton be.
For the sake of journalism, it is much to be regretted
that Mr Cunningham wu« sot promptly thrashed. If
he had any honour or marhod he would have instantly
di avowed all complicity in the obnex one publication,
or ha would have stood up to it. Th s s paper, as its
readers very well know, has not undertaken to defend
M'S. Langtry’s conduct. Bat it—and e»».ry othtg paper
whose editor has a spark of motculine deutnov left in
him—will defend a woman when aha has no chtnee of
defending herself. There is something in the spectacle
of the entire press of a great city swooping into a
woman’s bedchamber and giving np its columns to inu-
endows and vi!e suggestions—from which that woman
has no appeal—that far triusojmds the Jimitg .of criti-
cism upon Mrs. Langtry’s professional oosdu'ot In
Ameno^.’’
Local Self-Government.
Mb. Copeland thinks it is about time the dif-
ferent municipalities looked after themselves m
the matter of water supply. We for our own part
should like to know it Mr. Copeland has any
idea where such thoughts are likely to land him
and the Government ot action to which he Delongs.
Iheir hustings speeches are lising up in judgment
against them. The Licensing Act seems to be
getting administered somehow, but wo are just as
tar from any really efficient Byetem ot local
government as ever we were. It appears, how-
ever, from what Mr. Copeland said to the depu-
tatijn from Coonamble, that he and some ot his
colleagues would be glad if the country munici-
palities would take the work off their Lands, and
look after their own water supply. Mr. Cope-
land quite forgot to tell them how and where
they ware to get the funds, and yet that is the one
difficulty with which they have to contend, ihey
cannot raise a special rate for such a purpose, and
they cannot borrow money, because they have
no security to offer, and because the law, as it
stands, does not give them the necessary powers.
Under such circumstances, the Minister for Works
exceeded his warrant when he twitted the Coon-
amble people, and with them the inhabitants of
every other municipality in the colony, with their
want of self-reliance. I here is an Act of Tar-
Tiament which in some sort gives them the right
to appeal to him for help, and so long as that act
remains in force, no minister has the smallest
right to take country residents to task lor en-
deavouring to take advantage of its provisions,
Ihe Government has undertaken to supply Mait-
land, Newcastle, and other places with water, and
why not Coomynble ? Perhaps the line must be
drawn somewhere; but where ? Perhaps Mr.
Copeland would like to draw the line at muni-
cipalities that send members to Parliament; but
if so he will be likely to make many enemies for
one friend. In plain language, the old system of
bribery by public works has reached its limit. So
long as there were few people to ask favours, it
was possible to satisfy the majority of them and
to set the remainder at defiance, but the appetite
has grown with what it fed on, and the demands
on the resources of the department hayh become
so numerous and so large that it is impossible
with all the resources of the colony to aatisly a
tithe of them, and every refusal, every promise
broken, no matter under what circumstances,
makes an enemy,
• • •
The greatest difficulty, next to that of providing
tuuds, in the way of municipalities undertaking to
supply themselves with water, is the impossibility
ot obtaining the services of competent engineers
without the assistance of the Government, ihere
are positively none in the colony except those in
the service of the vVurka Department, and there
is nothing to induce them to come here. _ 'i hat
comes of the Government having monopolised ail
the engineering works for years past, and driven
away —literally starved out—all those whom it was
not disposed to employ, or compelled them to
accept subordinate posts under men whom it re-
tained in its service long after they had lost their
professional pride, and become petrified into mere
officials. In short, our Public Works’ policy has
destroyed competition, and no member of a
scientific profession can be trusted to_ keep his
professional knowledge abreast of the times with
out it—except in the rare cases of men who possess
genius. The tendency of the great mass of medi-
i ooritiea is to become votaries of routine, and
i acquire an invincible dislike to change when they
find the great incentive of competition removed,
i The true engineering genius is always searching,
1 enquiring, experimenting, learning; he accepts
nothing, even on the highest authority, until he has
made it bear the test of experiment and calcuatiou:
the official wantsno novelties; he regards recognized
authorities with reverence, and hates the restless
inquisitive people who persist in trying to upset
established formulas; in short, he believes in
finality. We have officials in abundance, but we
have never had an engineer of genius; and for
I this very simple reason, that the man of genius
| will not rest content in a salaried appointment
i He is too well aware of his own powers to remain
■ a mere spectator of tha contest for the rewards of
professional merit; he courts competition, be-
cause by it alone is his superiority made manifest.
It follows, then, that if we wish our public works
to be planned and carried out so as to become
what the amount of money spent on them should
make them, we must abandon our petrified official-
ism, and resort to something more elastic.
l * # •
We have already shown that, for political
reasons, the present system cannot be continued ;
no Government can long stand the drain of money
necessary to satisfy the demands of all those who
are continually desiring sustenance from the
great milch cow. If the greater part of the public
works were handed over absolutely to local bodies,
there would be employment for an army of
; engineers, and the competition between them for
the best employment would bring into operation
’ that natural law of the survival of the fittest
I which already produces such beneficial effects in
f other professions. The best and most capable
' men would soon come to the surface, and leave the
■ incompetent residuum where it should be—at the
bottom. To this end a sensible Local Government
Act is a necessity. The psesent Ministry, when
they took office, had the game in their own hands;
they had promised such a measure, which was far
more imperatively demanded than the Criminal
Law Bill, tha Babbits’ Bill, or other mea-
sures they have introduced, but they have chosen
to amuse themselves with trifles instead of grap-
pling with the serious work, which has been put
before them. On their own heads lie their fate ;
Retribution is coming upon them swiftly enough ;
their supporters are asking the men of action to
do impossibilities; and Mr. Copeland, the Grand
Almoner, finding the Daughters of the Horseleech
too much for him, has cried out in the anguish of
his soul that “ he thinks it is about time they
should help themselves." This is the beginning
| of the end.
Mr. Combes (C.M.G., you know) is in art what
he is in polities—he sits on a rail, like the eminent
Barns Wnen, four years ago, a few pc or devils of
arti&ts met together and tried to And a way out of the
Monttfl jre Du Paur net. the illustrious Combes stood
eoldly aloof. Now, ts judge from his speeches, Combes
is the Art Society, He never mentions an>tody else.
Combes talks better than he paints. The conception
of Mr Combes’ pictures leaves nothing-to be desired.
The Hebai-d is nearly always great ; but cn
the encampment question it was > a dime. We don't
know who wrote it \ but ae Isaak But has come to life
again, we should think it was GPU James It re-
minds ns so of the books ia which “ as the golden bars
of sunset were glinting athwart Salisbury Plain, two
oh valient might have been seen urging their tired steeds
in ths direction of the southern gate." The report of
the Governor’s speech alone is such a yell that we can-
not doit Justice in one issue. We will content our-
selves by saying that his Excellency the Governor
expressed an opiuionthat he was '* addressing soldiers ”
—but piior to this, jocularly observed that be wap an

Extract from the Continental Gazette,

The most surprising triumph for an American product
at the Paris Exhibition was the success of E Anhenser
& Co.'s Brewing Association of 8t. Louis, which
eclipsed Bass, Barclay and Perkins. Alsop A Guinness,
the world-renowned English brewers, as well as hnn-
dreds of rivals from Austria and Bavaria It is no t
surprising that a great sensation was produced when it
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro-
nounced the St. Loaia beer " superior to any mal-
Mqncr ever drank upon the continent," and that all

Parties living at a distance and desiring to furnish,
should wtiie for a copy of the “ECONOMICAL
HOUSE FURNISHING GUIDE," which contains
lists plainly showing to what advantage ready money
may be spent. Also full particulars as to Htuse Fur-
nishing.
List No. 1 shows how to furnish for £13.
List No I shows how to tarnish for £25,
List No. 3 shows how to furnish tor £35,
List No. 4 shows bow to furnish for £50.
I ist No. 5 shows how to furnish for £70.
List No. 6 shows how to furnish for £1C0.
List No. 7 shows how to furnish for £2CO.
Lut No. 8 shows how to furnish for £300,
These Lists have been most carefully compiled and
brought out in book form. The Second Edition is now
ru circulation. Onr Illustrated B 10k of Austrian Fur-
niture is also of great eervioe to ths intending buyer, as
it gives some idea of the immense and oomplele stock
we keep. TWENTY THOUSAND of these pamphlets
have been distributed within the last six weeks. Out
retail business in this class of furniture is probably the
largest that is done in the Australian Colonies.
OUR PRICES MAY HAVE SOMETHING TO DO
WITH THIS. Take, for example, Music Stools, Ana
trian Music Stools, formerly sold at £12a 8d, wo are tell
ing at 18s 6d. Full Suites of nine articles we are euablei.
to sell for £4 X7s 6i. We also upholster this class ot
furniture in cheerful and pretty patterns.
CAPITAL.
It was a capital idea to secure this column of Th e
Bsllktin, for the paper is not only read but kept. In
country districts it is a welcome visitor, the day of
its arrival being looked ferwatd to with pleasure. Our
popular Lists are, therefore, being continually brought
before our country friends, and in fairness to the paper
and its vast circulation, we must acknowledge its great
useful ness in extending our business.
We will now begin again at the beginning of our boob
and publish the lists in weekly parfs.

It is a usual custom with the aristocracy of the

W« see now that valour at home is once more

Mr. James Inglia, of tea fame, has, we see, in
a lecture at Parramatta, “ contrasted the loyalty of the
native population of India with the disaffection at pre-
sent existing in Ireland." Mr. Inglis, then, puts him-
self on the same level with an Indian blacktollow r At
least, ho puts his Indian bl&okfellows on a level with
the Irish. Whioh is an insult to the niggers—isn t it,
Mr Inglis P Oh, and as Mr. Inglis is so enthusiastic
about the “leyalty of the Indian niggers," we may
inquire of him what percentage of the British regular
army is stationed in India. Also, whether the loyalty
of the Indians isn’t a mere myth—whether it has not
been found necessary of late to adopt very stringent
measures with the disloyal native press. Indian tea
may be yery good, but it’s neither better nor worse on
account of the polii ical opinions of those who grow it.
Indians aren’t saints. England has a lot of greasy pen-
sioners, and disgustingly servile toadies in India, where
the bulk of the population are mere serfs. If we admit,
to please Mr. Inglis and the Herald, that all Irishmen
are on a level with the brutal scoundrels and cowardly
assassins of Phoenix Park, Mr. Inglis will still hare to
acknowledge that only a few years ago thousands of his
black paragons eagerly took part in the work of putting
us in the Black Hole—in outraging our wives and
daughters—in cutting off our noses while we lived, and
mutilating our corpses whoa we had died. Wo blew
these men from the muzzles of our guns—we even gave
them worse dsaths,—but the oraven spirit of the black
scoundrel, who fought and fell for his religion and bis
fatherland in his ewa fiendish fashion, lives beneath the
tanned hide of the eon whom ho begot—his blood and
bones manure tha E®il from whioh they gather Inglis'

The Maokay (Q.) Planters’ Association have re-
solved to send to China for more labour The importa-
tion of Coolies is to be given up. The importation of

A Warrnambool jury couldn’t agree in the case
of M. T. M L. Palmer, who shot one of his coolies
during a row. The jurymen were looked up llghtleas
and teodlesa, yet oven that didn’t make them of one
mind. The facts of the case were clear enough. Had
the victim been an Australian nigger, the verdict would
no doubt have been justifiable homicide. Mr. Palmer s
offence was not having shot one blaokfclloiv* but having
employed thirty imported ones.
According to the Gympik Times, a dog recently
imported to that goldfield from N.Z. was lately the
subject of hydrophobia, and had to bo destrovod. The
owner, a Mr. Harvey, one day found that his wife and
children had shut themselves up in the bouse through
fear of being bitten by the rabid animal, which was
foaming at the mouth, and snapping at anything that
came within its reach. After some trouble, and at some
nek of being bitten, Harvey succeeded in throwing a
noose over the dog, which was afterwards dispatched
with an axe.
A Windsor railway train being abunted, over- i
took a young fellow well known in Sydney, named
Parsons, and two ladies, on the Windsor Bridge. Want
of nerve killed him, and seriously injured ono of the
ladies. They jumped oil the bridge. Parsons was
killed on the spot, and the lady had a rib broken and
her wrist injured, besides being otherwise very much
shaken. The incidents of the affair are not very dear
There was room for a person to stand on the bridge
while a train passed, and two carriages did pass before
they Jumped. Two other persons were able to get over
the bridge before the carriages came up. Just before
the accident, young Parsons was seen holding the lady
on the bridge, as if to save her. Then she fell, probably
mlllng him with her. Parsons, who wa» 22 and single,
tas engaged at Messrs. Young and Lark's, Sydney.
A Paiisian is projecting a scheme of a “ Spoken
fouraal." He is to hire a hall, and the day's life of the
dty will be told by speakers every night. First, the
lolemn talker is to discuss politics in concise and
.lever language. Then the general newsman; the
speaker giving exact and the latest iteixs. For in-
stance : “ I went down to the house in such-and-such
•. street where a husband had shot his wife with a
revolver. The hair of the victim was enoh a colour,
tb© wounds w#r© 00 deep- I ascertained all the facta
myself.” It Is reckoned this would be very interesting.
An obituary-man will keep the death anecdotes posted
up; and a lady would give the society nows, telling of
last night's ball, and the latest divorce. The finance-
editor would give a few words of advice to speculators ;
and the dramatical-man, under police protection, would
speak of th» play. A speaking advertiser would finish
up, and produc* on the platform witnesses who had
been benefited by pectoral eyrup or sugar-coated pills.
Each speaker would be fully armed.
Some one in Melbourne, has not, we are afraid,
been telling the truth. - Miss Florence Levison, a lady
who is known to certain giddy people not to Ve a mem-
ber (wa mean an attending member) of the Congrega-
tional Church, but who is known to a few of the low-
foreheaded crowd as being a daughter of the late
lamented Madame Rachel, pawned some diamond
bracelets at a “ pop-shop” in Carlton, for £10, and sold
the ticket to a bootmaker to redeem them. The "snob,”
in question went to the pawnbroker and asked to view
the goods. Then “ mine unole” assured the bootmaker
that if he got the bracelets out. he (the P.B.) would
lend £15 en them *’ anytime.” They were got out; and
later the ehoe-man took the bracelets baok and said he
thought he’d take £15 on them. But “ mine uncle"
then replied they were not the same articles as the; ones
redeemed, and declined to lead more than .1 1 6d. on
them. There were two court cases about this, and both
resulted in favour of the shoemaker, despite the hard
swearing of Miss Florence Lsvison and the “uncle.
This is only au accident, of course, and will probably
interest few people. But what strikes us Is this :
What a splendid Darling Harbour witness Mis* Florence
Levison-Raohel would have made.
In tbo Christoburob (N.Z.) E.M. Court, Mr.
George Collier, hotelkeeper, sued Mr. Milner Stephen,
to recover two guineas, a fee paid for the alleged heal-
ing »f his daughter from a contracted leg. The plaintiff
stated that Mr. Stephan, after the “laying on of
hands,’’said “ Your daughter is perfectly oared, and
asked him to sign a book of printed forms. He aho
said the fee was two guineas. The plaintiff signed the
book and paid the foe. Ho noticed as they left the
room that his daughter did not walk any better, and he
called Mr. Stephen’s attention to it. The reply was
that she was perfectly cured, and instructions were
given to mb the joints with magnetised oil, and to band-
age the limb with bandages dipped in magnetised water.
She was to have bananas to eat. The plaintiff carried
out the instructions, except that he could not get
bananas, bat when measured the girl’s contracted leg
was found the tame as over. She went again to Mr.
Stephen, bat no improvement took place. Other wit-
nesses confirmed the plaintiff’s statement. The case
looted all day, and was adjourned when three more wit-
nesses for the plaintiff will bo called, Mr. Stephen said
he would not call witnesses from Christchurch, but
applied for six weeks’ adjournment, to enable him to
have evidence taken in the other colonies as to the
efficacy of his cures.

famous shipowners of old days—Anderson, Anderson,
and Co.—Mr. Davitt, of Davitt and Moore, another old
shipping firm of standing—and a Mr. George Slader.
Anderson, Anderson, and Co, and F. Green and Co.
are managers (there are no directors), and seem to have
arranged things as comfortably as may be for their
own behoof. They arc to be paid for their services as
brokers, and on general averages, agency, and salvage
oases, and are in addition to have 1 per o - . on any
vessel bought or built for the Company, and 5 per cent,
on the Company’s gross earnings. This last proviso
seems equivalent to an arrangement that, in the event
of the Company losing 10 per cent, in any year, the
shareholders shall have to make up enough in calls
to pay the managers 5 per cent, upon the turn-
over of the year. The nominal capital of the Com-
pany is one million sterliog. The paid-up capital
is £573 13(5, of which the managing (irmsown about one-
fourth.' How, supposing the earnings of the ships in
any one year were £350,000, and thefxpcuaes, including,
say, raising of the Austral, were £400,000, the share-
holders generally would have to make good £50,000 to
begin with. Tne managing firms would have to find
oue-fourth (their share) of this: £12,503. But the
Company would have to provide a farther sum, to pay
their 5 per cent, on the gross earnings, of of
which tne managers themselves would, as shareholders,
have one-fourth to pay: £4375. This would make
£13 875 in all which the managing firms would have to
pay’. And, apart from brokerage, commission, Ac.,
charged during the year they would have their 5 per cent,
on tne gross earnings to draw, vis., £17,500. This would
leave them £625 in pocket. The other shareholders
would have had to pay £37.500 out of their own pockets
to make good the losses on the year’s trading, and
£13125 towards the managers’ 5 per cent.; in all
£5)1625 solid loss to three fourths of the shareholders,
while tbs managing one-fourth cleared £625, besides
beia*' paid their own price for brokerage and so forth.
This seems rather a hot situation for the ordinary
shareholders, and certainly a “ warm ’’ one for the
managing firms. The Vanity Fair critic can’t discover
what has become of the Reserve Fund of £86.059, un-
lass it has been, literally, sunk in the Austral. Vanity
Fair is, however, distinctly a P. and O. paper. It
cracks up the P. and 0„ which is a swell concern, and
picks holes In the Orient, a “ city ” affair, you know.

AN AUSTRALIAN STORY.
CANTO II (Continued).
LVII.
The shuddering teamsters stood with words nnspskm
Of horror, upon tongues that could not speak.
And when at length the awful spell was broken.
One sought, with hands grown tremulous and weak,
To feel about the dead man’s heart some token
Of life, as oftentimes a man will seek.
With eager hope his reason’s vision blending.
To find some thing beyond all human finding..
LV11I.
The old man crouching, with his wrinkled forehead
Bowed upon hands that hid the awful scene,
Booked to and fro as one who mourned and sorrowed
O'er something sadder than what just had been
Moaning alow, •• Ob Christ, is this some horrid
Dark dream, or have I found my soul's lost jueen-*
The darling child I used to love and kiss.
Fallen from heaven to such a hell as this ?’*
LIX.
bnllocky, who stood beside him
Felt trickling from his eyas unyoated tears.
An 1 lifted his coarse paw and roughly dried 'cm
(Ho hadn’t wept before far nany years.
Not sicca his sunburnt sire did sorely hide him
For losing several unbranded steers).
And whispered to his mate, “ Jack, all is over
With him—let’s get a tableolotn and cover

His corpse. God help him, and God help the woman!
They always said she looked a trifle mad
Of late ; I know she used to drink a rum ’nn.
And he was ad—d hound—I'm almost glad.
But there—he’s dead. We’ll have to go and summon
The traps to stay with the old man and lad,
While we get her, No easy job, I’m thinking—
Jack, from this moment I’m full up on drinking."
LXI.
They whispered further, and the whole upshot was
That Jack went to the paddock at the back
And dodged a bask, which hack, at last when caught,
was
A very sorry specimen of hack —
And Jack, who fancied that he knew what what
In horseflesh, anyhow, looked very black
At this thin animal, and mattered, " Blast it,
It’s twenty miles—I hardly think he’ll last it.”
LZll,
But soon was mounted, and at full speed racing
Along the road to Us if 3 rty’s Mistake,
The dreary distance rapidly ( (facing,
A mile cf du-t left dinging to his wake;
Urging hia charger like a Bound head chasing
A wounded Royalist for Jesus’ sake. .
Small pity for hia horso he had—for hia own nec»
less —
And tore through darkness in a manner reckless.
IXHI.
When he had disappeared, bis mate drew near to
The cowering old and, speaking low,
Urged him to straighten up and have good eheot, to
Not feel so beaten—said he didn't knew
Who ho was that the woman seemed so dear to ;
And, while admitting it an awful go,
Raid that ha mostly found all women demons
When once i ffliotad with delirium tremens.

Whenever, by duty called, we go to the show, she is on

It was the first night of “ The Eomany Eye,”

Goodie (who is shortly to be married to an heirers),

tion and immaculate attire- We said to James (being
aa authority), ’* What is the meaning of • Romany ? ’

replied Jim, in eome trepidation, “I’ve had so ranch to
do lately that I haven't had time to road the book.
Where ean you buy it ? ’*
• • •
“ The Eomany Eye ” is a built-np piece in five
acts, and eome of them, we regret to state, ere very
bad ones. This play is a series of scenes which are
worked up to culminate in sensational tableaux. There
is in this ploy an “ancestral hall,'* a street scene de-
picting low life, a shipwreck, a moonlight effect, and a
dog. This was the star of the piece, and he was, on the
whole, fairly supported by the company. This animal
—a fine Newfoundland—has, unfortunately, a sense of
humour which he insisted in developing; and as ho was
not enacting a low comedy part, but a role which is of
the heroic order, bis efforts rather took the down off
the poetry of Miss Roland Watts Phillips’s conception
of Gertie Heokett. But the dog was effective, never-
theless; and it he goes on as well as he ia doing, would,
we should eay, bo enabled to star in “ Henry V.” at no
distant date.
■ * •
The plot of “ Eomany Eye ” is, in conception,
en a pat with the dialogue of the piece Both bear
signs of a man, who, if not written out, has written
wearily, and lor money; of a man who wss writing
against the grain, and oil of whose literary f Sorts were
enbeervient to the will of the stage-carpenter. Years
ago, pieces of this description were relegated in Png.
land to such theatres as the “Vic." the “Pavilion,”
the “Brit." and the “Standard.” They never saw
light in the West end of the town; the denizens of
which would have “guyed" the virtuous exploits of
“Jack Hearne;" have cynically received the out-
pourings of Qerlia Hecketfc’s soul; have listened an.
smilingly to tbe gags of Greville: but would, in all
probability, have applauded the dog. Now that civili-
sation has advanced strides, things are different !
Melodrama is de rigueur (we oanght this of Alfred), and
high class corned* at such a discount, that even if you
gave “the Romany Bye” dog a bone to come and see
it, ho would, xa all probability decline. Mr. Sims is so
fond of money that be has written until his eyes are
•ore, his heart’s action ia slow—until from a genial
yonng litterateur he has become an incurable bypoobon-
onac. 0 The Romany Eye " is direct evidence of this.
It is a study in mosaic, set by a mania a nightmare.
In the “ Lights o’ London,” there was humour, in the
Lights o’ London,” there was pathos: in 41 the
Romany Eye ” there is only the ghost of either. But,
•Ten worse than all this (and wo can forgive a great
?»1), there is not in the conception of the play one
lot* of originality 1 Wo have here the wrongful heir,
the rightful heir, the villein, the persecuted heroine to
whom the wrongful heir suggests giddy things (a course
»« emphatically deprecate), the funny man, and tbe
Hibernian. We, therefore, thank Heaven there ia the

Mr. W. G. Carey enacts the part of Joe Heokett,
a bird fancier, who is the unhappy father of Gertie, and
ho certainly scores all the boles he has a show for j but
Mr. J. X, Grovillo, who ia alsa a bird fancier, only gives
you J. X. Qrevllie until you wish J X. GreviUe h*d« t

of the Forties and is, by reason of th* uaiultftblfliiess
of the part a forlorn picture There is Joe folano, too,
who is a drunken sailor, and who gain* the respect of
the audience by demonstrating, in an unmistakable
manner, that he does not know how to get drunk. Mr.
Charles Mortyn ia an ex priffa-fighter, and depicted the
character In such a mild manner, that not even a goat
would have been afraid to shake hands with him. There
are in the oast about thirty more minor actors and ac-
tresses, some of whom will get a show next week. And
the piece was excellently staged j so well, indeed, that
nearly the whole of the applause (and there was plenty
of that) is duo to the great care taken anent the group-
ings. Tho properties also o Yinsoned great skill.

Mr. Hennings painted seventeen scenes for the
play, a number of which are effective, but none which
suggest much originality in either design or conception.
It’s no good, of course, saying that Hennings is not
Gordon, any more than It is of stating that Gordon is
not Hennings. But these are the facts, nevertheless.
Mr, Hennings has given us some picturesque Suage sets,
for which wo thank him. But we once thanked a blind
roan for taking eff his hat to us, “ I ho Romany Rye
will, we hardly doubt, have a long run. It must run
for some time, anyhow ; and if contemporary criticism
can make it a success, it ought to go on for over. But
then contemporary criticism cannot do this.

Miss Davenport ia, without doubt, a very pretty
and available little actress. What we like about her,
next to her sweet smile, of course, is the painstaking
style in which she does everything. This in itself la a
high testimony of ability. Nothing which was worth
doing was ever done without trouble. That Is. in all
likelihood, why an enraged audience does not rise up
and take the trouble to kill the whole oast of Gaiety
stock-actors. Leaving out Lear and Cordelia, there
was nothing to be seen in the play ; except Frank Cates,
who was very good indeed as Edmund, and Miss N.
Montague, who played the Pool. Miss Montague has
a lovely mouth for smiling. And she is very generous
with her cmiles; she doesn't care for the matter of a
foot, more or loss. We dare say the others who had
parts in this play were very good, but we can’t recollect
now which of them wo were particularly pleased with.
The safest thing, therefore, is to say that we were
pleased with all. Which is a lie, but wo are seared in
sin, and can tell it without a blush. This winds up all
we have to say about the Gaiety on this auspicious
occasion.

in Melbourne it will have been more efficiently re-
hearsed.” This is the sort of criticism we admire.
We are tired of the humdrum ‘‘it-took-well-and-gave-

Mr. J. P. Garvan. M.F.
Wk give a portrait this week of Mr. J. P. Qarran,
one of the members for Eden. Mr. Gatvan’a
political career, though brief, is creditable. He
forfeited a good position in the service of the Muni-
cipal Council rather than remain dumb and in-
active in public affairs. A few years ago he came
prominently before the public in the resistance he
offered to a political organisation started under
the auspices of R.C. clerical influence, and on the
question of education ho took a no loss liberal and
independent stand. His political campaign, in
consequence, was marked by bitter clerical oppo-
sition, which, however, availed but little In
Parliament, Mr. Garvaa has proved himself of
more than the ordinary intellectual calibre. He
appears to have marked out for himself a line of
consistent independent liberal action, and his
career may bo watched with expectation. In
mercantile pursuits Mr. Garvan has earned the
reputation of a shrewd, reliable man.
WOMAN ITEMS.
It matters little at what cost, woman will be
bcantiful if she can. And of late years, the chemist
has helped her much. " Bloom of youth, *' belladonna,
kohl and carmine, perfume and cosmetics, all enhance
her charms—perhaps. But they are not enough, and
now fashion dabbles in poisons till the boudoir is like a
dispensary, and the toilet table like a toxicologist's
bureau. Jewellers sell a curious ornament, a little
vial to hold morphia, with needle point, that can be
concealed in a glove, and the poison injected just befoio
the belle goes into the dinner or tall room, where she
wants to shine by the vivacity of her conversation and
manners. Now, however, another poison is steadily
rising in favour, and is enormously used in France, It
is arsenic. Ladies for whom it was presoribed as a
tonio and blood purifier found it gave them a pure
white complexion, and, at the oaule time, the voluptuous
roundnets that ia so ard«ntly desired and cultivated by
the ladies of Fiance. Englishwomen do net need to
cultivate it. While the dressmaker, with cunning
arrangement of pad end puff, can do a greet deal to
produce the muoh-deeired outline of ft bust en offrande,
it la only a simulation after ajl, and the artifice may be
discovered any moment. Arsenic makes the plumpness
real.
It is a common idea of romantic yonnp women
who have goed voices or good looks that they have only
to go upon the stage to have offers of marriage showered
upon them by noble foreigners and millionaires. Like
moat other ideas of buoyant youth, this one is a de-
lusion. The millionaire turns out, in nine canoe out of
ten, to be an nnoertiflmted insolvent, and the noble
foreigner a cook In a sixpenny restaurant, or a three-
card Even the stars of the profession have
not been universally lucky in their Jove affairs. Mali-
hran made a wretched marriage and lost heavily by a
husband whom she had to leave. Sontag, when a rich
and favourite prima donna, wedded a Gorman count,
who squandered all her earnings in gambling, and she
bad to go to .America to retrieve her fortunes, dying
miserably in Mexico Madame Griei was the victim of
an unfortunate marriage, and she did not, bettor herself
when she left her husband, and went to live with Mario,
who married her after bis predecessor's death Madame
Patti, too, has not escaped; for she married a
broken-down French marquis, who wasted her fortnne,
and she had to get a separation from him to become
the protdgd or the protector of a man much her senior,
with whom she has contracted a marriage, the legality
of which is questioned. Acting under his advice, aha
has spent enormous sums in the purchase of a castle in
Wales, where she is the prey of tradesmen, speculators,
and beggars, and she has to leave it every season to
raise money to maintain it and enable her and Niooliai
to live luxuriously during part of each year. Jessie
Grey is the only diva we can think of just now who bus
made a really bfiiliant w at eh So that, dear girls,
stage marriages are not all rose-coloured. The safest
thing for any dreamy young creature to do, who wishes
to wed a combination of intellect and bash, is to marry
a produce reporter on an evening paper.

PEPPER AND SALT.
Thiaia just aa true as it’s funny. Every Rand-
wlok raoe-day six or seven lightning dodgers are oarted
out to tbe course to wire the race news along to the
different stations. These clerks work from noon till 8
p.m.—that is when they are not watching a flatter or
raining their digestive apparatus with ball-dog beer and
sausage rolls —and in addition to their usual salary
they receive 10s. a day extra for demoralising them-
selves by attending races. The unlncky punchers in
the eity who have to receive all this business, and do
their usual day’s work as well however, do not receive a
single cant. This aptly illustrates the eternal fitness
of things connected with this department. Those who
do the most work receive the least pay.
The holy well at Mecca, the waters of which are
supposed to impart a marvellous memory to those who
drink it, has been found by chemical analysis to bo com-

In this it is like the saints of the Roman Catholic
Church—the holier they were, the worse they smelt.
Judging by this standard, a whole ship’s cargo of saints
must have been drowned in Woolloomooloo Bay at
some time or another. The waters there are also
famous for the memory they give you. You have only
to smell them once, and you never forget them.

This must be true because it’s in the Queens-
land papers, and an editor up there can no mote lie than
a park trustee or a new policeman. It seems that at
Cairns a fit boy, whilst diving off the piles of No. 6
wharf, went straight down the throat of a yawning
shark, who was so disgusted at not having a chow, that
he at once started for home at au O Lenryish
pace. The steam launch Zeus and the Govern*
ment steamer Vigilant gave chase, and aft or a sixteen
hours' run. caught and killed his sharkship. On open-
ing the briny brnte the dead body of a Chinaman was
found lying awthart the duodenum, and a little farther
on the fat boy was discovered trying on the Mongo-
lian’s toots, and wondering to himself how the French
were getting along in Madagascar. Persons who doubt
the above would doubt the Biblical yarn about the
whale which took the prophet Jonah, in mistake for the

The Philatelist is a now journal published in
this town. It is devoted to the propagation of the stamp,
collecting lunacy. Appropriately enough, its size is
about that of an ordinary postage-stamp. After some-
what patiently examining it with a mis otoscope, we
find its contents consist of items like the following
“Wo have received a provisional halfpenny surcharged
on black o» 5s. green.” “ We are favoured with the
current Transvaal 4d. stamp.” “Are you a stamp
collector H If so, encourage collecting by sending
ns one year’s subscription to this paper, two shillings.”
If the spirited dormouse who runs this infinitesimal
idiocy depends upon what he makes out of it for a
living we are as sorry for him as we can afford to be for
a dormouse just now. Noboby, it appears,' takes any
interest in this kind of thing except the very young and
the very old—infants and dotards. Playing with one’s
toes Is a respectable form of amusement when com-
pared with stamp-oollocting. The articles in this
Philatelist are well proportioned to the subjects they
treat of, and to the intelligence cf those for whom
they are intended—that is to say, the* are, if anything
somewhat below the intellectual level of a blow-fly.
The only way to make it popular with this higher class
of minds is to coat it with treacle. No doll house

Of princely porcelain's made.
And not of vulgar delf.

Our idol, though ha may

It’s quite a neat little game, and the darlings
work it this way. There ate three lady teachers in a
Public School,—say the Misses Brown, Jones, and
Robinson. When the Christmas holidays arrive Mias
Brown takes a sudden interest in Miss Jones, and
planks down half a sov. for the purpose of presenting
her wii h a perambulator, or a pair of “ vorses," ora
patent spring-bottom, sde delivery rat-trap, or some
other article of vertu, and each pupil is duly advised to
bring his or her little offering along just to help the
good cause as well. Then Miss Jones is “ quite taken
by surprise—only done her duty—always remember the
dear children’s kindness,” et at era cetera. When the
Easter season rolls round, Miss Joses fesla that some-
thing should be done to recognise the untiring efforts
of Miss Brown, and so the hat again goes round amongst
the youngsters. Than the Midwinter spree comas along,
and both Browa and Jones are determined that the
praiseworthy zeal of Miss Robinson will go
no longer unrewarded, so round goes the " cady”
again, and than when the next spell day arrives Miss
Robinson gets up, “just a nice little present, you know,
my dears, for Miss Brown who is so kind and good to
all of you.” Occasionally the parents “buck” and reinso
to “bleed,” and then the phlebotomy biz. is entirely
I carried on by the pupils, palms and a spare shingle.

Edm reporters’ heels are now level. By tko way, there
is a War Get published in this beautiful city. Several
things are “ wanted ” in the paper—chiefly money; but
what are also required ate “Three friends of the de-
graded and fallen of our fellow-men, who are
being reached by the agency of the Army, as refer-
ence to onr report on the Sydney fighting will
show.” We also learn that “ the Army will open
fire on the enemy at Newtown, in the Tem-
perance Hall, on the first Sunday in April;
a statement which is rather a crusher for a certain
good-natured politician, who is very much (when coffins
and Parliamentary duties will allow him) in the same
line. We grieve to hear, though, that at one of the
first of their Australian meetings, the Harmy was sub-
jected to some annoyance. The Captain says“ After
a real good meeting, we announced the Sunday meet-
mgs closed, and went On our way we were
stopped by a rough-looking man, who asked no if I
would * shout.’ I said ' Yes,* I would shout Hallelu-
jah.*” The man apparently had never heard of this
particular beverage, and was rude in consequence.
Several converts have been, we rejoice to hear, made,
through the exertions of the Capting. ‘Number 6’
writes to that gallant official of the Harmy, saying
“ Friends, I have been a smoker for 21 years. It was
my pipe that kept me back from God. I threw the pipe
up, and now I am saved. I drowned the pipe in Darling
Harbour." Another remarks with some fervour : “ I
got a clock on credit, and pawned it; but now I have
come to Jesus.” He doesn’t, however, say anything
about redeeming it. But one of the most remarkable
feats of the Harmy is a conversion which took place, it
seems, at Sheffield. We read that “ ‘ Black Pudding
Lnoy ’ got saved in the Albert Hall about six mouths
ago. She was a character known everywhere by
lioans and sinners of all classes. Since she got savea/
God has used her greatly in Yorkshire and Scotland,
She boa the name of ‘B ack Pudding Lnoy,' or the
‘ Sheffield Organ.’ Almost the last week she had with
the devil was at Doncaster races. There she got drunk,
and got thrown out of a flour cart and broke her
shoulder blade. Her husband and the servant have
I lately got saved, and she is away now in the Yorkshire
district working for God.” Bat even more satisfactory
than this is to learn that “ At night f there were] two
halls full, and a lot outside that could not get in. At the
close of the day, 17 fell into the fountain, and got saved.”
The Harmy in Sydney is only doing so-so. Curiously
enough to state, tha Capting, Mrs. C , and Lieut. Canty
reside now in that fairy bower, formerly the sylvan
retreat of—
The sisters Horan and their Pa,
Of whom you have heard tell on—
That mavi whose fist was bigger far
Than any water-melon.
In the classio precincts of Nithadale-streot do the
Harmy dwell—much to the discomfiture of the neigh-
hours, who, being mostly theatricals and wishing to
practice on their own account, are considerably exer-
cised by the braying of the Lieutenant’s cornet. Tom
Buckley lives a few doors up, and ha states that when
the “ Cap." plays his concertina., he can't hear his banjo
for the dogs bar king. The tradesmen in the neighbour-
hood, however, are jubilant. The run on saveloys and
red herrings since the Hadvent of the Harmy has been
tremendous. The molars of the Lieutenant are a terri-
flo spectacle, and it is a significant fact that he has only
been once asked out to tea . We don’t approve quite of
the Harmy, ourselves, but still, should Mr. Canty feel
more than usually hungry, he can sharpen his teeth
with timbor.rasp and have a turn at our paste-pot.

Syolhoy has lately been distinguished by the pre-
sence ot two distinguished literati Bailey of the
Tesioba Herald, ana “Cave Adullam" of the New-
castle Herald. Of the former gentleman, whose fame
the triumpeta of the world have sounded, we need say
nothing; but the latter may be best described as
a gentleman of exceeding mild presence, with symme-
tiicil whiskers aud a gazelie-liko eye. Both papers are
ns lively as evrr. Bailey asks : —"Where is the Wizzle
Wozzle or Feathcrlcss Crane ? Perched on the Old
Log, Watching for the Snake to Leave its Hole; 1 ’ while
Cave relates an incident which he calls a “ narrow es-
capo at Lake Macquarie," where three men went out
swan-shooting, and (wo quote)—"A few of the swons
which fell to the gnus dropped into a few feet of water,
and one of the three visitors undertook to wade out for
them, but upon approaching he was startled by seeing
a big shark But kis companions let fly at
the brute with their riflaP, and thereby probably saved
his life." Cave, has also, we see, two columns ot “ dry
tonics,” the meaning of which appears to bo incompre-
hensible anywhere oat ot Gladesville. When we saw
the author of these remarkable effusions we pointed
cut to him that since ever we had read what he wrote
about the “ August lady," we had set a price on Isis
head. Ha replied, however, that ho wasn't quite ready
to di# yet, having forgotten to spend three half-crowns
which W had locked up at home in the hat-bex. But
he intimated that as toon as he was through with his
wealth, bo would let ua know. We will then sharpen
our little hatchet.

discovers that his skull is no good to him he should
circulate it and let somebody else have a chance to
utilise it. We wish Dan O'Connor would send us his.

when they were at the rcene of the fire It was »ot
till then also that they discovered they had rushed eg
wi>h an ice-cream cart in mistake for the fire-engine.
But the ice-cream cart scrvtd their purpose just as
well. They shouted and awore, and hauled it about in
the usual fashion, and as usual the fire burnt itself out.
And then they went back to the bar and bragged about
what they had done, and were envied by all t he small
boys in the neighbourhood. We don’t know what firee
would do for a living ifit were not for firemen.
THE POLITICAL TRINITY.
S. M. Herald (recilebraticn ot 8i. P.tiioV. D«j): “ The aiffioolty is to find an Australian Saint to whore memory we may attach suitable tejoiongs.” Well, wo

A few days ago tho Government workmen along
the railway works applied for and obtained a risa of lx.

Some expression of surprise was patent in the
Gulgong Town Council when it was discovered that an

advice of his fiionda. the alderman in question declined
tho challenge, but vehemently stated that if yen asked

A public educational spelling-bee confined to words of

The msthetio tastes of our legislators arc sur-
prising. One of them is a great buyer of hides and

porters as they bend down to hump tbo bales. Then,
If a man is more than usually hurt (they dare not com-
plain) the gifted member takes a shilling out ot his
“ kick ” (as he calls it), and says—“ Here, yon
(something), go out and get a drink.” One day, though,
he got hold if the wrong porter. The man didn’t say
anything at the time, but when tho sale was over, ha
wGked out after tho hou. member, until ha was some-
where in Woolloomooloo. Then he took out a brad-awl
aud ——. But why continue ? Forthreo weeks after-
wards the hon. member took his meals seated on a oano-
bottomed chair with all the cane cut out of it: and
when next ho went to Hill, Clark, and Co.’s, he was
during the sales quiet unto pensivenoss.
Asa rule we object to snake yarns unless ac-
companied by a certificate from a minister of religion,
or the local penndkeepar or tho auctioneer ot the dis-
triot, but there’s a ring of truth about this that equals
the recommendation of a whole by nod. Thomas J.
O’Murphy, a cockatoo squatter-up Capertea way, was
mooning about the ranges the other day in search ot
either salvation or " cleaned-skinnod ” cattle, when he
suddenly found a horse hanging over a precipice. One
end of a stout rope was fastened round hia hook, and
ihe other end round a gum tree, thus holding the
yarraman suspended ’tween heaven and earth, like
Mahomet's coffin. Further investigation proved the
strap was a snake that had wound its tail round tbo
horeo’s leg and then taken three turns round tho
“ gum ” and tied itself up in a slip-knot. It was 15
feet long, but when Thomas J. O'Murphy Jet the horse
loose, tho snike came right back to its natural size,
viz, 5 feet 6 inches. It had stretched the rest—at
least either it or Mr. O’Murphy did. The horse now
lies miles beiew in the Caperteo Valley; and out in-
formant lies whenever he can hope an andience.
We learn from ’Frieo that Jem Mace gave an
exhibition at Mayor Kollosk's Baptist Tabernacle, but
at New York he was committed for trial for giving a
precisely similar exhibition at Gilmore Gardena (I)—a
place of public entertainment. We think this is too
bad We have seen a groat many shows given single-
handed, and consider that Maoe’o exhibition is pe-
culiarly devoid of all that is calculated to bring a blu-h
to the cheek of the modest maiden—wemesa the modest
maiden that is not, given to blushing. Wo have seen
tome religious shows in Sydney that have made us
blush more than Mace's did. That was when tho parson
came out and said: “A collection will bo held by tho
deacons after tho sermon, during which period tho
choir will pt rform an anthem. It is a fitting time now
io remark that tho way in which tha majority of tha
congregation neglect tho House of the Lord for the
House cf the Devil (the theatre) is disgraceful; and
this course of conduct is calculated to lead them to tho
Pit of Gehenna. When I state that £3 5a. only was

From Copenhagen we receive the intelligence
that, under the new Licensing Reform Act there, “no
showily-dressed girl is to be allowed to stand behind a
drinking bar to fascinate youth of tha other sex ” Wo
think this clause would bo of great service if enforced
instead of tbe “ entering ” ono in Sydney. We know a
poor fellow who came to grief terribly all through a
pretty girl at a city hotel. He was newly married, and
was taking the “ Missis ” and his mother-in-law for a
picnic It was, however, discovered that the beer had
been forgotten, and he went np to the Pig and Whistle
(we suppress the real name of the hotel, for obvious
reasons), and bargained for Bass But there was some-
thing behind the bar which enchained bim—a study of
Cleopatra in wax, reading a sixpenny novel. He ordered
sharr v-and bitters. A long man with Permanent
Artillery whiskers then arrived. This led to a com-
mand for and brandy. The order being sup-
plied, a gentleman from the Lands Offloe lounged in.

POLITICAL POINTS.
Mr. Copeland has resigned.
The N. Z Government had a pledge from the
Governor that if an adverse mot ion were curried against
them over the pardon to To Kooti, there would be a
dissolution and an appeal to the country.
Dan. Mayne is of opinion that country magis-
trate* are now as plentiful ns fleas in a blaokfollow's dog,
and he therefore respectfully declines to swell the ranks

A meeting of Liberals was held at Leicester
(England), in February last, and a Bulletin resolution
was carried unanimously. Singularly enough, no one
present seemed to have heard of The Bulletin This
was the resolution: —" That, in the opinion of this
meeting of Liberals, the military expedition to Egypt
was impolitic, and a dangerous interference with the
rights and duties of the Egyptian people, and was also
inconsistent with tho Liberal principles and pro-
fetsions."
The Sultan’s indisposition shortly after the
military a It cay in the outer court of his palaoa is sar-
csstioaly referred to in a London journal as explicable
on the hypothesis that Mis Majoety had been under the
impression that some one was going ta commit suicide
upon him. By the bye, what has become of the ex-
Sultan—this fellow’s half brother, who ruled for a few
months subsequent to the “ suicide" of Abdul Aziz,
and then was deposed. One never hears a word about
him now Has some one “committed suicide” upon
him, too?
Wheri the Bill legalising any “agent” to ap-
pear in court on behalf of a prisoner was brought in a
few nights ago, only one lawyer was honest (or foolish)
enough bo vote against it. The rest of our legal legis-
lators were conveniently conspicuous by thoir abfeuoe.
No doubt they fully understand that the man who de-
fends himself has a fool for his client, and that he who
makes out his own will leaves all he has to the lawyers.
Future trials will soon be as funny as a Bum leader or
a Presbyterian Synod.
Some time ago Lord Carnarvon—a leading Con
servativa— boasted that there was more literary ability
and culture on tho Tory than on the Liberal side. He
was challenged to prove it The issue of the challenge
is a monthly magazine founded on tho model of the
Fortnightly and the Nineteenth Century, and called
the National Review. Alfred Austin in to be the
editor. The magazine is to be as stiictly Consorvative
as Blackwood. Now, if our shadowy Liberal party
mads a similar challenge to the spectral Conservative
cliquy, we wonder who would edit the production ?
Andy Lynch, probably.

O’Donovan, of Khiva fame, declares that
Russia is determinedly pushing for India. Men and
beasts have been lavished with a profusion which would
seam insane were not the object so clear. Skobelofl
and Lizareff lost 60,000 camels between them, repre-
eenting a money value of £900,000, The Russian grip
upon Khiva costs, to maintain, about six millions
yearly. O’Donovnn comes from Asia, and says “ Persia
Delongs practically to Russia; the Czar’s troops are
within easy striking distance of Herat; tha Afghans
will join any enemy who attacks you; your Indian
empire is not worth thirty years’ purchase.” Tho
British public listens, yawns, and goes to dinner.
Thus a Melbourne correspondent “ The
Service-oum-Barry Host are so elated with their vie-
tory that they have commenced terrorism in some of
the departments by issuing instructions that men in
tho Government service must not take part in any social
movements for furthering tho interests of tho working
classes, unless they—tho bosses—approve of it. This
is good, as coming from tho gentlemen who denonnoed
Irishmen for speaking on behalf of their country, and
who call themselves loyal and liberal politicians. But
the people won’t stand Mr. Berry playing aristocrat
and autocrat. He has begun the game too late in life
to succeed; and as for Mr. Service’s liberalism, its
Alpha and Omega is simply, only, absolutely nothing
more than £ s. d. Ton'll hoar something sensational

When Mr. Hurathouse and his party went, in
accordance with permission received, to survey a rail-
way trunk lino through the King country, they were
intercepted by a strong body of To Whiti's people, who
made them prisoners and tied them np. Then 60 of
the Mauiapotos came along and rescued them. Mr.
Bryce, the Native Minister demanded the surrender of
Mr. Hursthouse’s captors, waereupon their chief, Ma.
hukee, bsoame very defiant, and declared he would pro-
ceed to Alexandria and capture Mr. Bryce. The Minis-
ter was made aware of the design, and called out the
Toawamuta cavalry. The military, with a force of con-
stabulary, awaited tho natives, who were all mounted,
and called on them to surrender. Mahskoa was defiant,
and called on God to help him. Ha didn’t help him,
and the cavalry surrounding the natives captured and
lodged them in tho Alexandra Barracks.
The Whitehall Review, an ultra-Conserva-
tive landlord organ, writes on 1st February in a strain
which contrasts very strikingly with the inflammatory
utterances «t our three Conservative dailies in Sydney.
“If the truth could be known, the Irish parliamentary
loaders are not,” says the Whitehall, " less disposed
to rejoice over the misfortunes which have fallen upon
the assassination societies than other people. They
have been probably as much terrorised by the secret
assassins as the Castle officials themselves. There is,
of ooarce, a certain connection between Feniauism and
the National League, as between Fonianiam and the
assassination societies, but nothing can be more im-
politic than to mix up the designs of tho handful of
dosvierace xnon who have been plotting tho murder of
the'Goverament servants in Ireland with the loaders of
the pari y whose aim is to dissolve the connection with
Great Britain.”
“ Tbs impunity with which Skye crofters have
defied a'ibe their landlords and the law has produced
the natural results,” says Whitehall Review. “The
movement is no longer confined to Skye, but has spread
to the whole of the Western islands. The present con-
dition of affairs is as bad as anything in the history of
the Irish question, wif n tho exception of tho murders
which are now the daily recognised accessories of politi.
oal agitation. Not only are the landlords defied and
the local authorities sot at naught, but the officers of
the Court of Session itself are mat with stones and
bludgeons.” Then the fashionable paper pleases its
patrons by explaining that the Skye people are of the
same race as the Irish, that is to say the Celtic, which
isn’t true, as the inhabitants of the Hebrides have more
Scandinavian blood in them than any other inhabitants
of Great Britain, except Orkneymen and Shetlanders.
The Skye people are Presbyterians—kirk-gonsg folks.
Bat even that does not make amends for their heavy

Sir Wilfrid Lawson, tha leader of the British
Temperance Party, addressed his constituents the last
week of January, and spoke Bulletin plain English :—
“ He wanted to know what the Egyptians had done to
make them the enemies of the Queen. The popular
idea was that we wont to war to protect the Suez Canal;
but he defied anyone to find a single fact in any Blue-
Book to lead to the idea that there was the slightest
danger to the Canal. We went to war to prevent the
Egyptian people voting thoir own Budget, and in tho
interest cf the bondholders. It had been said (he con-
tinued) that Arabi was a rebel. Mr. Disraeli onoe said
that he was on the side of the angels; for his part, he
was on the side of the rebels when they were right. He
believed rebels wore generally right. It took an im.
mense deal of Injustice and oppression before people
rose in rebellion. Rebels I Was the Liberal Party to
go round the world bunting for rebels? Were not
Hampden, Cromwell, Washington, Kossuth, Mizzlni,
Garibaldi rebels ? He did not mean, at the bidding of
anybody, to abandon his principles, to turn his coat, or
to enlist under the Jingo flag.”
Michael Davitt appears to be the genuine Wil-
liam Tell of Ireland. He has never drawn a cent out
of the League funds yet, and he is as ignorant of tha
proper form to receive tha patriot’s usual illuminated
address and pewter-pot testimonial as the bob-tailed
bnnvip is of the ten commandments. Michael’s opinion
to day is that Ireland has had too much oratory and
perorations np to the present date, and bo futhenaore
considers that if Paddy had a little less “ sunburstry ’’
and a little more bread he would be a falter if not a
wiser man. He declares that out of IS 060.000 acres of
valuable Uni in Ireland, only 1,000 000 are under culti-
vation, the balance being required for the pleasure of
the titled landlords; and he swears by all that is in tha
heavens above, and the earth below, and tho waters
under the earth, that he will never beg a tingle cent
for the Irishman who pays one farthing of rent to
these star-iodizenad but useless drones. Wo need
scarcely add Mr. Davitt spends eleven mouths out of
tha twelve in gaol, and the balance in qualifying him-
self for further grants of that distinguished privilege.
He doesn’t “keep shop ’’now with either Parnell or
Redmond.
A cablegram, dated March 21st, states that
“ there is a strong feeling in Liverpool against employ-
ing Irishmen in any capacity This, being inter-
j rated, signifies simply that the Liverpulleans son tern-
plate Boycotting the Irish. Now Beyootting has
uniformly and bitterly been denonnoed as a vice, and
as a vioo peculiar to the Irish alone, We presume the
same authorities as laid down that doctrine will now
discover and announce that Boycotting, although not
peculiar to the Irish, is a virtue or at least justifiable,
when resorted to by Englishmen. Tha fact is that tho
first contention is ho s h. Boycotting is but a new name
for a proceeding as old as human passions It is msli-
cions and unfair, whoever uses it. But it is so in the
same sense that all practical devices of ill-feeling are
malicious and unfair. It is not so malicious and un-
fair as tho wholesale throat-cutting called war and
etiacted under the patronage of Royal Princes nicely
dressed for the business, and carefully kept behind the
common men who are to do the fighting and chance
the killing. By all means Boycott away on both sides.
What’s saueo for the goose is sauce for tho gander;
and don’t talk sentimental rot about foul blows when
the fighting is a matter cf life and death.
The British Government has wisely deter-
mined to merely remonstrate with those beastly Boers
Instead of declaring war against them, aithongh they
are massing their forces and “ dar’-ing the Britons to
come along and put np their Wolseleys. There is no
fun in fighting these pig-headed Boers whatever; in
fact, as Granny would say, a war with them would bo
“ indiscreet.” They positively refuse to give back our
cannon and other little valuables captured, and, besides,
they can shoot a trifle also. In four open battles, the
Boers, without any artillery at all, shot down the
English commanders—shot the gunners from their
cannon-shot tho troopers on their chargers—shot
sergeants, captains, majors, and colonels in the field,
and kept on doing it until they shot Commander-in-
chief Colley. The consequence is they are about tho
best hated, but, at the same time, the most respected,
nation that tho British Lion ever howled at. And
England's promised remonstrance will have about as
much effect on the Boers as a bread pill would have on
the green hide stomach of a Darnley Island mammy.
We have just as good and as plucky men as the Boors,
but our men can’t shoot. And the Boer army isn’t re-
oruited from blaokgnardom. We can’t fight tha Boers
man to man until we do learn to shoot at long dis-
tances.
When we’re quite done “ playing at soldiers ”
this trip, it would be interesting to know how much we
pay for tho fan, and how much we are likely to receive
in return for out money. Complaints roll in day after
day about the scandalous delays which take place in
the receipt and transmission of our telegraphicteiusi-
ness, and jot, in ono of the very busiest weeks in the
whole year, tho heads of this messed-up department,
and the pick of the smartest operators, have to spend
five days at Middle Head, blasting up innocent fish and
endangering the lives of all who sail np and down the
harbour. No less than 22 loads of baggage were sent
to camp for the Torpedo Corps alone; six of the best
men had to leave their proper work nearly a week before
this sanguinary war began in order to fix up the
“ glims ” for the electric light, and tho whole of the
clerks who stay at home and do double work receive
10s per diem overtime. The cost of flattering the
vanity of a few with this useless toy is almost equal to
the expense of the whole encampment at Windsor. It
is notbins very unusual now to find our interoolonial
business 2*10 messages behind by dinner time. Citizens
growl in the daily papers that it takes eight hoars for a
local message to travel 80 miles ; some of the country
station masters’ hours are so disgracefully long—11 and
15 a day—that they are forced to entrust part of their
work to incompetent boys. Is this Wright P

A CARNIVAL OF COLOUR.
give ns to write this high critique,
O Muse of Art, ne common quill!
But something colourful and Greek—
Something that all the page shall fill
With glow of rose and Chian wine;—
Something that of old days shall speak,
And things that onoe were held divine—
Ere our dull web of days was spun,
And what of old for love was done,
Came down to hire—
A sunbeam from the ancient Sun
Tbat touched the Parthenon with fi r e—
Or an electric wire.
We have it— the sunbeam. The Western skies
rosy-rad as we sit down ta write this screed, amd no,
whoerar else is dead, are very lira; we are indeed. It
i» with a spirit of reverential awa that we begin to
'* k of the prodnotlons of ganins, the hearts-blood of
hirhart. Thereislittle enough inatraof stars inthelifeof
m !n little enough rainbowoolour of romance in waking
hoars, to deal otherwise than teudarly and reverently
with what wa have. The world at large ie common-
ly common. Art is not. That is why wa were
bo timid about entering the temple of art now open at
the Town HalU But, like the test mariner of Horace,
we mailed our breasts with triple brass and stalked in.
The man at the door-who had a fine frenzy in his eye,
tnd about half a pound of pomatum in his hair—asked
ns for onr ticket. Wo smiled a mozzotintO smile and
pointed to our flowing looks. Ha flippantly replied
that wo had mistaken the plaee-tho police-station was
farther down. Then in an al fresco whisper wa informed
him that we had only been playing with him, and hand-
ing him a renaissance pie wo passed in. We watched
him, from the back of the screen, pat this away in a
Pan! Veronesa style that was bsyoud all onr previous
conceptions of the capacity of art. We may mention
here, in apology for not having loft our boots on the
threshold when entering, that although we knew the
place was holy ground w® saw a Bum reporter Just bo.
hind ns. and concluding th it discretion was the better
part of art-criticism, wo kept them on.
• • s
The prize-pig era is slowly passing away. The
pioneers of civilization in three oelonios were just the
sort of men required for the time and the work before
them. Their hande were big and horny as hands
should bo that have to hew a path through the primeval
wood for the march of a nation. Also to grease cart-
wheels. There was no romance about these pioneers.
It was not required. They wore not intended to think,
but to '• bullock.’* And they bullooked, and their ohil-
dren bullooked, and thoy were all builooks together.
But the time has nearly arrived when we should have
something more spiritual, something to give scope for
that finer half of man—which is usually kept in a black-
hole at the back of his head—to ass ert itself. There
some people even in this city who have souls. This
may be an astounding statement, but we think it justi-
fied by the remarks of our reverend fr lends every Sun-
day. They seem to think that there are lots of people
with eonls—to be damned. However, we are sick of
mere muscle. It is quite in the order of things that a
generation believing in bone and sinew, and worshipping
the man who could lift the heaviest weight, should pro-
duce a generation which grovels before the tow-headed
geda of cricket and sculling. Bat this order of things
is passing away—very slowly but very surely. The
young man with the fat biceps and fatter head is played
out, like other shew monsters. It has taken a long time
to oome absut, but at last we have discovered that
there are snob things as sunset and sunrise.
• • «
The Art Society of New South Wales was es-
tablished under difficulties. Some few years ago, a
couple of artists came to this city, and suggested to
the cognoscenti the desirableness of establishing such a
society. The soi-disant cognoscenti smiled cynically, and
remarked that enthusiasm was a cheering thing to see,
and enviably peculiar to youth, but had the fault of
most other coloured articles—it wouldn’t wa<?h. The
courageous artists, however, stated their determination
to hunt np all the other painters in the city, and start
the guild on their own account. And they did. But
they had some trouble. Artists, like j onrnalists, are,
as a rule, a shy race. It cost the lion-hearts we have
allndad to a considerable amount of time and trouble
before they could gather a representative crowd te-
gethei. There were the boilers to search, and the
Domain to explore, and every time they were on the
point of captaring a painter, he wo aid dart oil thinking
they were policemen. They hit upon the right idea at
laat. They baited these sons of genius with bread and
onions 1
• • •
This is a plain, unvarnished tale of the origin
of the Art Society in this colony. After it was fairly
on its feet, and in no need of pecuniary aid, the cog-
noscenti came in. They—but never mind. The Garden
Palace being burnt down, it was necessary to find some
P-aoe in which to show the annual collection of pictures.
The ommittsa decided upon the Town Hall. The
“*yor cheerfully gave them the use of it—for £50.
Art aaydse nothing to aldermen; but wo are rather of
an opinion that, in deference to ‘the tastes of people
who are not wholly engrossed in the pork-trade, the
Hail should have been given free. But we always were
enthusiastic 1
We are only going to deal with the striking
Pictures in the collection : the rest can rip. First,
thsreigthe painting of “Mrs. Langtry’* by Mr. Glad-
etooe Eyre. This is a very flue picture. There is a lot
0 paint on it. Gladstone apparently haa heard at some
or other that the Lily had an alabaster skin, and
9 acted accordingly.

jj. n ‘ now Wa come to again, by J. K. Ashton. ,
6 it “ A Study,’* This allows us to say that, as |
we desire to encourage the cultivation of tho fine arts
in tho colonies, we reproduce some of the beautiful
studies now being exhibited in tho Town Hall. We
begin with this one. So :
The keynote of this delightful picture is pensive
spirituality—a tender far-offness of visionary delight.
There la a liquescent soulfulness in the oye t an ethereal
curve in the eras that lift the thoughts of the beholder
up to nobler things immediately he sees them. Borne
people might object to the si«59 of the arms and
shoulders, but we don’t. We consider it was a happy
inspiration of the painter to make them so gigantic.
Bnrne Jones, or any other tyro, would have made the
physique slim and graceful. Mr. Ashton is not so
crude. The body of his girl is big because it
has to contain such a lot of soul. This is very high art.
However, this same painter has a really charming
picture called ••Patience," which we should like to
buy, only wo are afraid our credit with artists will not
be good after this.
• • •
Mr. Hoyte exhibits a lot of landscapes. They
are all pretty, though somewhat oloographish in style
We mean in monotony of colouring. Piguenit’s pio-
tures are, as a rule, full of charm and character. This
artist is one of the few who have caught the sentiment
of an Australian landscape: which is loneliness. Miss
Catherine Devine has a delightful sketch in water-
I colours— ’• Happy Moments "—and Messrs. A. Colling-
I ridge, and the whole catalogue of others have each some
I good work. But for grandness of conception and snbli-
I mity ef treatment John P. Russell is the man for us.
I Just gaze now on the chef d'ceuvre which we have made
I a sketch of below.
W hero are year old masters after this, we should like to
know P Tell ns the Titian, the Tintoretto that could
have produced such a masterpiece as this I The pic-
ture tells its own weird story. Ariadne is evidently a
confiding: cook, who has been inveigled into going down
to Clontart by some designing Bacchus in the “(oorce.**
Bacchus is net in the picture—probably he has fallen
over one of Mr. Combes* (C.M.G.) liver-coloured rooks
and broken his blessed neck. Ariadne, however, seems
to have wandered down to the beach to look for mussels
—no impropriety implied—and getting tired has lain
down with her head in a shell. This shell is in Itself
snbj sot enough for a year’s study. It is about the size
of a bathing-house. If a shark had a shell we should
say it was a shark-shell, but as a shark has not we pre-
sume the painter intended it to typify a theory of his
that Ariadne was a mermaid, and always carried her
shell with her. We are glad of this hint, as otherwise
we might have thought she was an oyster. But we
can’t reconcile the second-hand red-velvet boarding-
house sofa-pillow which she has stuck in the shell with
the age in which she is popularly supposed to have
lived. But then we haven't much of an eye for the
higher touches of art. Perhaps this also explains why
we cannot see the poetry of her having elephantiasis in
her ankles. Her pose, however, is perfect. One band
is thrown listlessly behind her head. The tooth-comb,
however, is only suggested. This is the true delicacy
of genius. There is a great breadth of treatment about
the mouth, and a gigantic grasp of subject in dealing
with the ears. Taken altogether, though (we have an
airy way of supposing that our readers can afford to
hire a van when they like), this is a very valuable pic-
ture. Wo »e not practical painters ourselves, or we
should be able to say bow valuable, but next time we
see a man on a ladder we shall ask him to go round
with us and give us an estimate of the worth of the
colour and frame of " Ariadne." This is not all of Mr.
Bussell, however. Ho has done some very fine work,
notably “A Bather," a portrait cf Prank Cates as
“Joseph Surface," which is wonderfully true to the
original, and a wonderful example of how superior por-
trait-painting is to photography, when the painter is a
real artist, as Mr. Bussell undoubtedly is; and “ Caris-
sima Lnigura," an Italian girl, with a face tor which
men might die. There is cue drawback to this latter,
however. She has haunting eyes, full of tender and
tragic histories, and a brow like Phidian Fallas, but the
pain-killer on her face spoils the glamour of the whole
thing We can't feel sentimental about a female with
neuralgia The brown blotches on her face certainly
give variety to the picture, but we don't care for
variety; it is too distracting. Mr. Bussell, however,
can be facetious when he likes. He has a picture of
the Exhibition ruins, wherein, with a merry conceit, he
introduces a group of Oreek figures. We did not see
any dynamite under their cloaks, though. Which
reminds ns that we thought of getting in a joke here
about Greek fire, but we don’t seem to be able to work
it in somehow. The fact is, ever since we saw the
Evening News Baskin making what be sanguinely con-
sidered to be notes with a pipe-stem on a cork sole, our
mental balance has been completely upset. We pass on
to the next lot. This happens to be a sweet thing in
sepia, or briok.dust, or something. It is called ** Best-
ing." With our usual disregard of expense, we give a
sketch of it. This is the sketch:—
Now, this is art, it you like. Juat observe tho penile
girlish coyness ot the lovely creators 1 She is weary,
and eo she leaps against a dog-leg tenco and muses.
What is she thinking about f Lilies and roses, and
sweet ma-j>ram? No, dear and romantic reader; she
is thinking of tripe and onions. We can sea it by the
attitude of her mouth. And now we oome to the real
gem, the Kohi-Noor of the whole collection. It is an
epic, a revelation. Reverently wa repreduoe it!
It will be Men at onoo that this is a nocturne in black
We don’t put in the black because ink is too expensive.
Montague Scott is the man to whom the world is in*
dotted (or this noble ne plus ultra e( art. He calls the
I'otnre 41 A Station on Fire," but this is only his
amour. All great artists like to mystify the public
seaeionally. The real motive o( the picture is the
!g. All the resources o( art are used up in producing
lig wonderful conception.
» ♦ •
There is a divine pro-Riphaelifcism, a magnifi.
jut Eembrandtesque chiaro-oseuro of treatment about
ae curl of the tail, and a dreamy Fra Angelico style
bout the droop of the lower jaw, which work the be-
older up into a frenzy the moment he sees them
hen it is well (or the painter bold that he is at home
y his own snug fireside. Wondrous and beautifully
ightmarish is this creation of Mr. Montague Scott,
'he Moses of Miehael Angelo, the Athos-Alex-
nder of Stesiorates dwindle into gnarly dwarflsbness
rhen compared with this mighty adumbration of no-
leaningness. This pig is a poem in black-lead.
• • •
Mr. Combes paints a good deal. We noticed,
y the way, just casually, that ho condescends now and
hen to borrow English skies for Australian landscapes.
' Curl Curl Lagoon," for instance, is a simple trans-
position of Buxton Knight’s 41 Morgan’s Porths.”
Chare are two or three trees added; and the additions
re the worst parts of tho picture. Bat Mr. Combes
un paint when ho likes. Judging by hia exhibits in
he Town Hall, be doesn’t often like. His skies as a
oile are an hour too early for the landscape, and his
audscapos mostly alien to the skies. This is about
mough for Mr. Combss. His reputational an artist
leems to have been based on hia educational report; and
;hat educational report has long ago gone to glory.
* * *
And new we are getting tired. Art is all very
well in its place, but we shouldn’t care to board with
artists always, unless we could get half-an-tour’s
ktart of them at the stow. There are heaps of pictures in
this sxbibition, which we should liito to say something
about, on’y we haven’t time For instance, there is
what we cbnsid r to be the flower of the whole show
(298), 4 ‘ A Portrait,” by Mrs. Stoddard. Mrs Stoddard
is, in our op ; nion, the only artist with a poetic brush
in the colony. We except ourselves, of course. Also
the men who paint the land sale Paradises We don't
know why it is that so many Australian artists will
insist on painting plates of liver and bacon, and upon
labelling them •• By the Sea," and such-like misleading
titles. There is a heap of jejuuces about whatever
indigenous art we have here. Over-colouring is the
principal fault. Vesuvian skies look down upon seas
of blue broth as a general thing in these pictures. We
noticed one, however, that we thought very much of
It has a very fine frame. 4 ‘The Exhibition on Fire"
is, if we remember rightly, the title the artist gives it.
There is a lot of paint on it. We consider this picture
in advance of the age. The talented painter should
bury it for about a hundred years, and leave instruc-
tions to bis heirs to let it remain buried We musn’t
forget, though, 44 Govett’a Gorge," by Mr. C. Stuart.
This is a noble picture. It consists mostly of
abyss. This is the Abyes-inian school. And
speaking of schools, wo should say that the
present bitter rivalry between the Pyrmont and the
Woolloomooloo schools of painting can be productive
of no good to either side. We shall stand neutral, any-
how. That will not, however, prevent ur. from giving
a line to a lovely thing by G J M. Cans dell: 44 A Bull-
dog " —in distemper. It takes an artist to eeo tho point
of this joke. Altogether, and finally and conclusively,
we are weary of art. We intended to write a very
ohai min g lyric about something or other, but we have
forgotten what. It was, we believe, dedicated to red.
ochre. It seems only the fair thing, though, as we have
been so erratic throughout this article, that we should
curl it up J)y saying that every line wo have written has
been written in the very best possible spirit—rum.
“ 0. J.” in the Down anp Gumtreb Journal,
starts a poem with the line “ Some day I shall bs dead.”
It is, indeed, a beautiful thought.
Sir Alfred Stephen visited the Art Society's
Exhibition on the private day. His only regret is that
he is not on (he hanging committee.
At Herborton (N.Q.), a so-oalled man has been

The biggest mishap that has occurred around
Monnt Ararat since old Father Noah couldn’t find a

An avalanche has come down the old hill and made a
shroud for a hundred people in the valley, w here the
dove la going to find food now, w<> don t know. This
•will be sad nows to poor Frank Warden in quod.
A correspondent informs us that the sensational
accounts appearing from time to time in the Evening
News, re the Billy’s Look-Out rush, are simply gigantic
lies. “I see," be writes, "that the News says
the Billy’s Look-0 at diggers are getting 15 grs to. the
dish, and that six miles from the rush a never-failing
supply of water is to be had in Lake Cowal. As a
matter of fact, Lake Cowal has teen perfectly dry for
the last six weeks The News- statement regarding the
15 grs. to the dish is on a par with the water in the
lake. The facts of the rush are these Prospecting
has boon going on for some time on this run by two
men. Both bottomed on gold. Some dishes went
about 4 grs., while others only gave 2 grs.; others not
even the colour. One man considered he bad payable
gold, so he hoisted the red flag and reported to the
Warden. At the present time there are 500 men on the
ground, and any number ©f holes bottomed—some
getting the colour, while the majority don’t gat
even that. The only water available is one dam in the
centre of the rash, and which will not last above three
weeks. The bulk of the country worked
years age, with the same result as the present rush —
disappointment- Numbers of men are still contit. g.
while some are already leaving the field. Five cart
loads cleared out this morning. Provisions are reason-
able, but horse feed very dear—chaff 20a. per owt. The
diggers complain of some papers publishing unreliable
states? eats, and oansing men to leave good wages to
find, on their arrival, that the field is a duffer. A per-
manent supply of water is to bo had on the Blond
Crock, about twelve miles from the field." ,

The preposterous statement as to the alleged
running of one hundred yards by two amateur athletes
at San Franci:oo (U.8.), in less than ten seconds, has
been, of course, proved to bo erroneous. Tho Califor-
nian editers, who originally reported the race, deter-
mined to gat up a second race to prove the truth of
their assertion. Well, this race has duly coma off. on
a carefully levelled path, with a large staff of officials
and two reliable stop-watches good to mark fifths of a
second, and. as a result, the time taken by the same
amateurs (Haley and Masterson) was 10 2-5 seconds.
So the attempt to wipe out the existing fastest on
record has egregiously failed I
There ia “ weeping and wailing and gnashing of
teeth" among the religious brethren in San Francisco,
who hold that their Metropolitan Temple, over which
tho Rev. Mr. K vlloch of unsavory memory has been
presiding, has been desecrated by blows from hard
gloves ovi?r the curled fists of Mace and the Maori. It
will be remembered that the sat-to occurred on a Sun-
day night, and that the regular organist of the
Temple played sacred music whenever the profes-
sors of the agonistic art paused to take breath. It is
stated that the trustees of tho Temple will go into
sackcloth and ashes by church for a time
and worshipping elsewhere, meanwhile requiring the
offending Kallooh to undergo a year’s holiday.
Thanks to the vague wording of the conditions
of the 22 foot race in tho Woollooraooloo Biy pro-
gramme, ,we shall have a good open beat race next
Saturday—ratber an unusual event since the 24 footers
hsve been crippled with limited crews By the way,
the Woolloomooloo committee, as usual, was very much
Sydney Rowing Club. The 24 foot race was virtually
given to the Adelphi, owned by Mr. Pitzhardinge, for
joira a prominent member of the S.R.C , and ditto the
Senior Doable Sculls to the S.E C. boat, by disqualify-
ing Mosers. Williams and Seale ot the M R.C , and
ordering the race to bo rowad again. Mr. Drewett, the
umpire, distinctly stated on tho steamer that ho would
not entertain any protest, but ho must have been talked
to death by the committee, for he foolishly gave, at
a subsequent meeting, the above decision, which,
though doubtless bond fide, doesn't look well.
Says a New Zaaland writer:—“ Mr. Pilbrow
informs me that he intends to send Welcome Jack and
Clarence to Victoria early iu the Spring to try oon-
olu'ioas with ths cattle over there. I cannot bnt think
this a rather rash step, for both horses a-e, on the mere
s mad of their performances in this colony, bound to
gat stiff weights olat ped on them. Welcome Jack’s
five victories at Auckland, for instance, have bean freely
commented on in iho Australian papers, and the
handicappets will scarcely be aware of the fact
that the horses he beat there are tar from the highest
class that we have in the colony. Tim Whiffler and
'I be Poet appear to bo about the best of tl e lot that he
defeated there, and the owners of those two horses
would bo tho first to admit that they are not at the top
of the tree. Far better keep the horses in the country.
I say."
Our chances of winning the Intercolonial Eight-
oar rsco do not look particularly brilliant at present.
The N.S.W. crew won last year by a fluke, as it is well,
kuowu the Melbournians started a weak and overtrained
crew, but we may look for a diffsrent state of things
this year; and bur eight has been weakened by the loss
of Gadeu and Johnson, the two best men ia the boat.
We are afra’d members of the 8 R.C. had much ihe
preference iu the selection this year, and that members
of other clubs did not get a fair show. Brodio and
Bros are the only men in the boat over 10it, meet of
the others being closer to 9it, and unable to win races
either singly or pair-oars. Good little men are better
than Lad oig-’uns, but we have tho material for good big
men, and had Mr. Oatley iu the first ins ance overcome
his penchant for little men, and taken some strappers
in hand, wo might now have bad a first-class crow to
meet the Victorians.
The latest “ strike ” out ia that of the three
hurdle horses who started for tho Steeplechase at tho
late Koroit meeting. At the first fence two of the flyers
positively refused to oven crawl over it. Tho other
*• stick negotiator," Barb, got over after a little
persuftsion, but when he cttuie to the nest trouble he
Sat down and raspaotfdlly, but firmly, declined to move
another yard. One of the excited spectators now
kicked the top rail off the fjnoe, and the Barb ooude-

The A. J.C. Autumn meeting commenced on
Easter Mouday. Daring tho afternoon th* weather
looked threatening, but the rain held off The attend-
ance oould not have been far short of 20,000, The ball
was set rolling with the Hurdle Race, which was won
by Warrigal, after a groat race with Satellite, by half a
length. First Try third. Tho Autumn Stakes fell to
The Assyrian, who Just managed to beat The Plunger
ia the last few strides by a short head, Darobin third,
very close up. The Champagne Stakes resulted in an
easy win for Warwick, Copra fisoond, Abetloyle third.
Only three sported silk for the St. Leger, about which
there was no betting and which was appropriated by
Navigator, Morpeth a length and a half away, Nicholas
bringing np the roar. The Doncaster Handioap foil to
Sardonyx, who won a floe race by a neck from Glou-
cester, the favourite (Creswiok) a short length away,
third. Tho Trial Stakes brought the day’s sport to a
conclusion with a win for Kaipara, who beat Bet tins,
by a length, Manfred half a length behind, third.
Some people oould make fun even ont of the
funeral of a rich relation. During the recent libel
fizzle, DeMestre v. Syme, Mr. Porvos, the sardonic
Victorian barrister, and who was the owner of the
racehorse, Waxy, caught a bit of a Tartar in the shape
of Mr. Sam. Watoham, part of whose evidmoe went
along in this wise:—Mr. Pnrves : You know Lord
Burghley? Witness: Yes, and Waxy too. Mr. P. :
Oh, Waxy always ran third. W. : Yes, except when
he fell down in front of Savanaka. (Laughter) Mr.
P.: Did he ? Dj you know that is a falsehood? W. :
No, I da not. Mr. P.: Do yon mean to insinuate that
Waxy fell down purposely in front of Sivanakal W.:
No, but if the cap fits yen ean we xr it. (Great laughter.)
Mr. Watcbam further observed fiat Lord Burghley was
an “ in-and-outer," bub Navigator was an out-and-
outer, and then Mr. Pnrves, who evidently felt as ill at
ease as a b larding housefiraon a hot plate, told Samuel
he oould step outside and enjoy the scenery.
When the nominations for tho Now Zealand
Cup were opened, writes •* Hippona," the C.J.C. stew-
ards must have been both disappointed and astonished
to find they wore four less in number than received for
the last A,J.C. Handicap of 500 sovs I am afraid by
the time tho race is to he decided, the sixty-six nomi-
nated will have considerably dwindled down, for a num-
ber of the Christchurch people have entered their full
string. The Hon, W. Robinson has no less than nine
in the race, Mr. “ Horsford" five, Mr. Stead, Mr.
“ Bate," and Mr. J. Stephenson, of Dunedin, four each,
Mason and Vallanoe, Mr. Butler, Mr. Cntts, and Mr.
Montague Smith, of Gtsb irne, three »ach, while a num-
ber of other owners have nominated two. The only
Australian owner represented ia Mr, Thos. Ivory, of
Sydney, while among the tew now horses in the list is
the Christchurch Middle Park Company's colt July,
who is full brother to Sir Modred and Betrayer, and
the last of the famous ruck of Traduuer and Idalia. Un-
fortunately through having been foaled two days before
the 1st August, tho colt now ranks as a three-year-old.
The handicap will appear on the 1st June.
Billy Edwards, the American ex-champion of
Fght-weigh's, has offered to bet £250 that Jem Mace
cannot knock him out ia tour Quecnsberry rounds. The
noble art is all but played one in England and Ame-
rica. and this boxing business is but a sorry substitute,
as evidenced by the resuscitation of ro many old man.
Better examples of tbe two styles required for boxing
and fighting cannot bo taken than Mace and Sayers
when in their best day. In point of cleverness with
the gloves Mace far and away better than the
bricklayer, and would easily have bested him in a box-
ing encounter; but he would not have had a chauoo
with him in a real fight, as Mace is well known to have
had a weak spot in his heart, and Tom Sayers was the
mau to tied it ont. Mace cnoo challenged Sayers to
fight, bat that was after tbe Farnbirongh affair, when
Sayers was bound down to never eater a 24 foot ring by
tho terms of the a, muity tbat had been subscribed for
him, so Jem was pretty safe in issuing his challenge.
Maeo fought some grand battles, notably witi King,
Black Travers, and Brettle; but hia affairs with Mad-
den, Goss, an i Coburn, would not bear inspection.
A correspondent has asked if dependence can be
plate! on Suward’s 100 yards in 9J sec. Wo think not.
The following is an extract from an account of the
race between Seward and Robinson, in London Bell's
Life, of October 6 1844:—" After nearly twelve false
starts they bounded away together, and a more oven
• go eff ’ could not have been effected. The pace was a
splitting one, and they ran as nearly abreast as possible
for sixty yards, when Seward made one of the most
splendid rushes ever witnessed, and in a few strides
left tbe Lancashire clipper at least two yards in the
rcir.. Robinson teemed thunderstruck at the circum-
stance, but ho brought all bis energies into action, and
endeavoured to overhaul tbe leading man, but without
success, for Seward went in a gallant winner by about
two yards. The referee stated that it was not more
than a yard and a half, white others asserted tbat it
was a full three yards. The distance was run in less than
ten seconds, tut the American Deer said that by his first-
rate wateh the 100 yatdi were tun in nine seconds and a
quarter.” It will be noticed from the above that the
r.fereo gave tho time as "under ten seconds," and
that tho record of 9J is claimed on the word of 11 the
American Deer” who was merely a bystander.
The four-oar outrigger race, between the N.Z.
Rowing Clubs Union (Christchurch) and the Star
(Wellington), two miles, was won by the latter. The
Wellington men averaged a psunl or two more than
the Christchurch men, and they trusted their steering
to the bow oar, while Christchurch carried a coxiwain.
A good start was effected, both gripping the water
simultaneously In the first minute 41 strokes were
registered by each, and tbe boats wore almost level,
bat anothsr omple of minutes found the visitors row-
ing 39, while Wellington had dropped to 33. The Wel-
lington crew oould now bo seen f. rging ahead, and the
bow oar steering a splendid course, they gained a
length. Christ church lost some distance by bad steer-
ing on the part of their coxswain. When halt the dis-
tance was covered, Wellington took a most decided
lead, and gave the visitors Lbeir backwash. Two to
one and throe to ene were offered on the Wellington
crew. The Christchurch men rowed very pluckily
throughout, and kept a faster stroke than their oppo-
nents, bat oould never rednoa tho distance which sepa-
rated them from the leading boat. When a mile and a
half had been rowed the Wellington crew eateri down,
and pulled in au easy winner by live lergths. The time
was 11 min 33seo. The water was exceptionally smooth
and favourable for racing.
Hioken has written still another letter in the
Melbourne Sportsman, in which he makes bis posi-
tion look weaker than ever. “ Heavy exchanges" must
have taken place between Abe and his dictionary.
"Sit”— ■* meaning, of course, the leviathaaio pro-
fessar"—In answer to yours of last week I hope to say,
by permission of tho editor, a few words in self-defence,
and as you are a professor of the noble heart, and an
• iucated one too—no joke intended —I shall have very
little trouble in my rejoinder. Briefly, tho whole
question turns en tne meaning of tho word ** box."
You, sic, were the first to introduce it in your letter to
this paper, and in order to give it prominence you
italicized it. Knowing as I do, and as you do, that
fighting with nature’s weapons is illegal, and that any
reference to a contest of that kind, using the word
‘light’ for instance, would probably prevent the ap-
pearance of this or your letter, I adopted your word
• box,’ which I find to mean by all lexicographers ' to
fight with tho fist.' And that was my intention from
tho start, and which I now repeat. I wish you, -ir, to
understand that I dd not elesire to make an 1 exhibi-
Lion ’ of myself by a puerile or lackadaisical glove con-
test. With your brawny arms and grant muscular
development you shou'd have an ambition above that.
I aoknowledge your courtesy in stating that yon wish it
to be distinctly understood that you bear me no ill-
will. I thank you. There should be no ill-will between
bravo men in manly competition. Instead, my dear

sarily get the best of it)i 'rthy not Call rin or direct jour

Dr. Frank Powell, of Lacrosse, Wis.y who bao
an extensive practice as surgeon and physician, has
likewise attained celebrity ns an expert marksman witki
either rifle or pistol. One day, reoently, after having#
at a distance of about twenty yards, tired six shots
from hie rifle against the edge of a silver quarter in-
serted in tho target, embedding it deeply in the soft
pine plank, a friend of hia placed himself in front of
the target with the stump of a cigar in hia mouth; this
tho doctor shot away, leaving barely an inch between
the holder's lips. Powell then laid his rifle aside, and
producing a calibre 22 pistol, placed upon the bead of
his assistant a pint-battle cork; a report, and the cork
was blown to pieces. Then a peanut-shell was placed
npon the aesiatint’a nose; a snot, and that, too, l»y
scattered upon the floor. Taking a knife-blade, hw
fastened it firmly against the target. Upon each sldw
of the blade bo hung a tiny boll; than, calling hie office*
boy, ha placed between the youth's fingers his Masonic
ring, previously covered with a piece of white paper.
Between the boy and the target the assistant stood with
a cigar in his mouth. Stepping back fully fifty feet,
the doctor raised his rifle, and with an •* All ready,
steady," to his assistants, fired; a report, and simul-
taneously two sharp rings from the bolls. The ball wan
found to have passed through the finger-ring, snuffed
the ashes from the cigar, and splitting upon the knife-
blade, had glanced and rung both bells. This, of
course, sounds almost inoredibio. Bat it is, neverthe-
less, quite true. We hope to be able to publish in The
Bulletin shortly a complete exposition of the prin-
ciples of snap-shooting, showing how any man possessed
of average sight and nerve-power may become a " dead-
shot."

St. Leper Day saw fair weather and a fair
crowd. The members’ portion of the stand held a
ruaj irity of ladies j the other part, moaly the somore
Bex.. An acknowledged leader of fashion wore a. whifcrt
India muslin, with train, bonnet to match, much ad-
mired. So was a trained pale blue dreas bonnet worn
by a Bandwink lady, by whoso side walked a stalwart
Assembly ofHiinl A brown satin, brocaded in yellow
fljw«rs. witu brown brigand hat and golden plumes,
made a portly lady a conspicuous figure on the lawn:
and a combination of maroon satin with carmine
broo! n, with longhteced skirt, was an elegant con-
Btruction. A pair of flacey looking fabrics wera eye-
catch ng; ene cream, with brassy trimmings, under a
small poke; the other of china white beneath a Hack
velvet and gold jockey cap, both showing soma in-
genuity of make. Mrs. De Lissa was in red rust satin
that looked vivid on the green grass. Also noticeable
was the short dres- of a sunny girl, pink and blank
stripes, and round a straw hat “ she wore a wreath of
roies.” Next pasted by, a very shapely blank dress,
with strawbecr.v-red patterned bodice and draping A
mustard brown cloth, emphasised with dark brown bow
and trimmings, was fashionable to the eve; and ex-
ceedingly neat whs a grey silk, long plaits down the
skirt, with o. broad raohing, which, like the well-fitting
body, was ef dark brown satin; a brown straw sailor
hat surmounting all. Mrs. Pirani; was distinguished
by a moat pretty costume of white nun's veiling, nicely
draped and shape 1. embroidered in cream silk work,
and relieved with rifla green now and ribbons Enough
to maka any one disregard S. Weller’s advice altogether.
Two sisters wore—one, an unsatisfactory shade of what
might be called dilated mauve, the other, satiuof indigo
blue with golden lines down the skirt—and a lengthy
cricketer was contiguously visible. One of the most
stylish specimens of attire was a cream close-fitting
bodice with a narrow streak of rnby velvet down the
breast with gold braiding, which also appeared on the
wrists, a la militaire ; cream skirt very amply extended,
with long plaits and broad band of ruby. Somewhat
analogous was a red-purple skirt with check fop, also
having military stylo of breast, laoe edgings and hat to
correspond with the dress. Nothing was choicer than
a black dress and accsssorioa; the tunic was elegance
itself, with black laoe edging; parasol also sombre,
with foot-broad laoe flattering round it. Then a black
moire bodice, over black and white stripe skirt, all in
small kilted flounces, was tasteful. Escorted by the
Head of the Fooroe was a lady whose handsome dress
of black gros grain with draping behind a and long tabs
over pleated satin skirt was well worth glancing at. If
not the most sumptuous, then nearly so, was a beauti-
ful trained dross where lavender and fawn brccided to-
gether oombintd to make a delicate and pretty hue, set
off with a draping of light coooa-brown brocW, and
kilting thereof. And the owners of all these pretty ,
things were, let us hope, deeply grateful that a well-
watered road enabled them to get homo without any
ruinous destruction by dust.

A fancy dress ball (chiefly to children) was
given by Mr. and Mrs J S. Carroll in the largo hall of
the new A J S. Bank, West Maitland, on completion of
the building. I was crowded, yet attractive Dancing
began at 8 o’clock, and most of the juveniles left at the
hoar of 12; when the elders protracted th» fan for
some bouts longer. Among the remark-worthy charac-
ters were: Miss Nood, a pretty Starry Night; Miss
Lucy Carroll, a stately Daubers of D evonshire j Miss
G’IUop, a Swiss Peasant; Miss Mabel Carroll, a French
Peasant; Miss Blair, as liilac; Maude and Clara
Wolfe, as Cupid and America; Miss Griffiths was
Minnie Warren—but, even at her smallest, could
svaroely got down to the minnio mam size of that tiny
lady. Miss Swan wx» Empress Josephine, end a very
phine girl, too; and Mias Capper, a Fisher Girl—though
all girls are more or less that. Miss Barlow was Mro.
Gilpin—which reminds us, why don't thin girls ever go
as Hairpins ? Mi-:s Helen Griffiths depleted a Bride—a
character that almost ever r young lady considers ehe
is specially suited for. Miss D>eont made a decent
peasant. We wouldn't say more than that if she was
the loveliest Mias in the world, booause it would pre-
vent our getting that joke in. Taero were several Mies
Sparkcs, who shona brightly in different characters.
Miss Marian Pearse was Montana; Miss K Capper, a
Water Cress Gatherer; and Miss Charmers, Goody
Two Shoes. Miss Clift appeared as Mary, Mary, Q ilte
Contrary, a r61e not usually assumed by ladles till after
marriage. Mr A Carroll came as a Clown, and looked
bo nature’. There were lots of other delineations, such
as F.iirv, Rovebub, D.iwa, Hamlet, Sarjemt Ballantyne,

to say that the tendency of the bad was very social-
istic, for the Peasants seamed to think themselves as
good as the Kings and Queens—a most dar gerous

warming was the little bank-wet that was provided for

The Liberals’ Eeunion in the Maaonio Hall was
varied and pleasant, Afier the Lyceum ckoir had
opened with music, Mr. Charles Bright spoke about
Spiritualism, its supporters and detractors, being very
severe on travelling conjurers who, professing to ex-
pose spiritualism,really perform conjuring tricks which
scoop coin from the pockets of the thoughtless and
dupe people who are prepared to bo duped. Songs and
recitations followed, Mr. Parker gave a comic piece
from “ Hamlet,” and Mr. Duggan delivered hatan'a
Address to the Sun so forcibly that there has been vary
little son seen since. Mrs. it L Watson gave a short
address and then spoke a graceful farewell, repeated
rounds of cheers following her from the platform.
MUs Ada Campbell alio spoke, after which dancing
commenced. To the music of a band of three, a dozen
damns wore managed. Some dresses were plain; but
the ladies in the choir rose to the occasion, and were
quite rainbowy. Mrs. Roberts donned cream and blue
satin; Miss Tyerman wore a nice cream costume; Miss
Stria wore blue satin, with white lace and silver trim-
mings: a handsome brunette was in dark sky-blue:
Miss Walker was especially gay in crimson satin and
rich ye’low skirt; Mias Barbar, a petite and nretty
dancer, wore silver grey, and a quartet of McKeunya
wore the popular combination of white and scarlet.
Light refreshments wore available, and midnight saw
the gas out.

We had a vague idea that there was enough
money am issed at the Garden Palace F dr to stud * he
whole of North Shore with churches But already, so
i <blo is the demand for sacred edifices over there,
au - her bazaar is found necessary. When we went
there on Easter Monday, wo found the door blocked by
one of the gifted representatives of the senior Sydney
newspaper, who wan trying to make an honest-looking
person in tpe porch understand who ho was. He said
•‘HvjuldUI’* Just like that. “ Don't sell’em her a.’’
replied this gem of a doorkeeper; •* this is a bizaar.”
The gifted representative explained that ho didn't want
to buy anything, but oamo as a reporter for the most
sober and solemn sheet in the Southern Hemisphere.
Ths primaeval man persisted ho didn't “ know anythink
about aay 'brald— ’ad they a h ffloep’’ A civilised
person came up then, who believed he’d heard of a
paper called the Herald ; and we got in We wore
there too soon, even then. The principal business
seemed to bo broom operations. Some young ladies
were finally adjusting their stalls, anl personal adorn-
ments while a tin all boy was busy carrying in j im tarts
The Hon Alex Stuart, who was billed to open the
bazaar, didn’t appear No one seemed to know why;
but »ii believe the real reason was that the posters were
printei on green paper. The Rev S. H Child officiated
instead, and then with " God save the Quaen” the show
was declared open. Woolwork, toys, and the usual nio-
naoka chiefly filled the stalls, though there was on one
stand a large display of Afghan jewellery strikingly
suggt’s ive of the “pomps and vanities’’ which the
C of B. so earnestly denounces. Perhaps it is because
they are such objectionable things they are being dis-
posted of. A sceptic might Imagine he saw raffle lists ;
but they w.re only ’‘drawings,’’ which is quite a some-
what similar different thing.

A party of ladies aud gentlemen, mostly well-
known amateur musicians, took advantage of a holiday
visit to’Pitt Water to give a concert on Saturday night
at Bolt n’s Hotel, and It being the first affair of the
sort the residents of that pretty vicinity came in force,
and filled the long room and verandah. All went satis-
factorily, and afterwards soma residents entertained
the musicians and some friends at a nice supper, about
50 sitting down. Home through the moonlight, chiefly
in boats, and a promise waa given by the visitors to do

Trade has been very vigorously pushed at the
bazaar in the B C interest at Glamia Hall, and man is
attacked at his weakest point. When beauty besieges
vanity, there's little question who wins. A Christmas
tree is a notable feature in the centre, its foliage spout-
ing little gas jets at every point. Mesdames Brennan,
Hart, Coffee, Gerber, and Butcher manage the stalls,
assisted by oisses Keating, Parker, Butler, Maloney,
Butcher, aad a light skirmishing brigade, all dressed to
the greatest disadvantage—to men's pockets. These
ladies have about seventeen different methods of
wheedling oat money, and whichever way they try,
success is a dead certainty. The door is watched; a
pink young lady approaches the viotim with a wooden
inkstand, and pats him down for “ only a shilling,’’ on
a very shadowy chance of winning the article—which
from that moment disappears from his gaze for ever.
Ho turns away, when soma vision in violet dashes out
from the nearest stall and invites his attention to a
wooden lamb, or a woollen boras, or a hand-painted
picture that might be either a flock of sheep or a ship
in a storm, but ho is not supposed to inquire; it’s " for
charity,” and besidas, "it’s so cheap.” Of course, he
parts. The dear girls don’t perceive that there’s just
a little incongruity in appealing on behalf of charity
and cheapness in one breath, but it doesn’t mat-
ter, so long aj he parts Then he calcu-
lates on a rest, when sailing along comas a
small maiden in white, with a pencil nearly as large as
herself, and the inevitable list, and a smile that seems
to fan bar soul,and in his dazed state he says "yes ” to
whatever she proposes. He finds that means twa shil-
lings for a hundred and tenth share in a lookiug-glaa*
or a carving knife, which will be “ cheap to the winner”
at oighteonpeuoe—if he can only bring himself to be-
lieve it’s worth more. In a quiet corner is a pretty girl
cradling a cruet-stand in her arms pensively; another
in black sails fl osvera that buyer s never look at, beoaust
the prettiest flower is carrying the basket; while a
slender belle in pompadour, writes letters in weira
orthography, of a flirtatious nature, at sixpence a piece.
Some charming assistants are most helpful, toe, only as
they are of a different sect, their presence is slightly
puzzling, like the ffy in amber. In the middle, two
gentlemen work au unlucky bag, where, for a small pay-
ment anyone who dips in is just as likely to f}sh out a
piano, or a sheep station, as a tin railway train, or—
nothing. Miss Compton favoured as aooompauyist to
thp singers, who sang several pieces with or without
special ability ; while the Eastern Suburbs Brass Band
played at intervals outside, and the National Authem
brought Easter Monday to a close.

A large number of invitations aooapted for a
fashionable dance at the Hon. J. B. Watt’s, "Eyno 1 .'-

be the opening of a monthly series similar to last
year’s A carpet dance was given at “Alpine House, ’’
Maoquarie-street, last week; music, recitals, pretty
dresses and fun, also helped things .Easter Monday
saw two fairs opened in Sydney, and two in Melbourne,

A pastoral staff, intended as a present to the

At Minnesota, several citizens were arrested on
the curious charge of stealing bibles. A freight, train
was wrecked, and residents in the locality purloined a

the secret of England's greatness resulted in a respect-
able citizen going into seclusion for two months.
Henry Ward Beecher was born in 1813. His
father rose from the aavil to be a great preacher. The
sen became pastor of his first church at 21 and has oc-
cupied Plymouth Church, Brooklyn, since 1847. What,
aver opinion may be held of his teachings, he is a clever
preacher, a fine writer, and possesses extraordinary
personal fascination. The Tilton oass proved that
The Duke of Cambridge, as Commander-in-
Chiaf, has announced that a furlough of eight days
will be granted to all soldiers in the British Army, in
April next, who desire to keep Passover week. This is
unprecedented. It can only be supposed that His
Senile Highness either desires to propitiate the chosen
race prior to raising a little loan, or else has reached
his dotage.
The latest thing out in “corners” is a church
o»e. A few days ago Father Comerford, of Westwood
(Q ), sauntered along to the Landa-o flics, and bought a
CMfUi i piece ef ground. Nothing very strange, so far |
but when it leaked out that this allotment happened to
hold the only Protestant ohoreh in the town, the
followers of Martin Luther began to pray earnestly for
grace to bear up against this affliction, and for a long-
handled shovel to bear down on the priestly pate of the
wily Father.
If Dr. Arnold doesn’t stop short, he’ll get him-
self quite dislike!. Speaking of the London slums, he
says : *’ It fills ms with astonishment to sea anti-
slavery and missionary societies so busy with the very
ends of the earth, while all the worst evils of slavery
and heathanlsm exist among ourselves | and it pains
me and distresses mo to witness so much sin an! suffer-
ing, and contrast it with my own lot, so full of com-
forts.” This looks as if the “ poar little heathen ” was
unduly spreading himself, and wa may shortly expect
to find him starting a mission to convert gullible
Christian brudders.
Charles Haddon Spurgeon, who discards the
"reverend,” was born in Essex in 1834, and attained
great fame as a boy preacher. At 17, ho assumed the
pastorate of a Baptist Church at Waterbeaoh, and next
removed to London, where he drew immense congrega-
tions at once. His audiences at the Tabernacle have
averaged 9000 every Sunday he has occupied the pulpit
in it. Ho preached to 23,000 one day in the Crystal
Palace. His appearance is not intellectual or refined,
but he Is sunny and smart, with a fine voice. Spurgeon
married early, and his twin sons, Thomas and Charles,
both preach. Tommy, who visited N.8.W. a year or so
since, is in N Z He is a veritable twin—he has half an
average man's ability,

We have as much reverence for religion as most people,
and mare than many We mean true religion : we have
no reverence for sham or cant or humbug. Joe-Cookery
is a phrase wo have coined to express all three. Joe
Co,05 is an ‘'itinerant lecturer,” who stumped the world
on a patent-medicine-.piety racket, and got home the
other day with his pocket full of dollars and his sleeve lull
of t miles Jos fights against, infidelity in the Parthian
style as a rule. When verhe ischalleugedloa contest
by such men as hBADkAKftH or Inuersoll, he leaves,
and then throws dirt at them from a distance. We
should not take this much notice of him, only that
the little Joe Cooks of our own community have been
reproducing, in one of the religious pipers, extracts
from a lecture he gave on his return to America. As
we think it would be a pity it i oxe of these gems of
thought were lost, we rescues few from oblivion, and
publish them, with our comments Number one : “If
we hate what Hon loves, neatness to Him is hell, and
the great r the nearnes the greater the hell.” This
is balm for us We sha 1 never be damned for
hating Joe C005. Nearness to him is hell.
Two; “ Among modern Christiana one in twelve
may be a Judas, but the remaining eleven-twelfths
will convert the wdFld.” This is a strong argu,
ment out ot his own mouth in favour of Jos staying
at homo : he will never convert the world. Further:
“ Perhaps our modern Judas carries the bag, but after
betraying his L.ord, he does not go and hang himself.
You ought to go out and hang the Judases yourselves.”
The audience, it seems, did not take him at his word;
he still lives Which shows that the average audience
is more merciful than usually suppised. Again:
M Christianity has taken Charlatanism by the throat
and broken its nook." Which proves that Christianity
and Jos never met; and a very good thing for Jta.
“ Noticing,” says the religio is journal from which we
quote, “ the idiotic remark of Col. R. J. Isasiisoii,
in a lecture delivered shortly before, that • the Presby.
terian religion is the w >rst religion in the world,’ Mr.
Coak called upon him to ‘ explain by what strange law’
ic is that the • worst religion in the world’ ban for cen-
turies given, and is to-day giving to our world so many
of its very best people,' a task which, says our religi-
ous friend with grim humour, ‘the utterer of that
slander will not be in a hurry to undertake.” Why,
the thing is self-evident. So many of its people
are atr-ong the very best, precisely because they
have the worst possible chance to be so. As well might
it bo asktd why Job was a better min when he was out
on his dunghill s.raping his boils than when he was
ri;h and prosperous. Success under difficul.ies is the
most pnu eworttiy success of all. Therefore, for a man
who reads Joe Cook’s lectures to restrain himself from
getting mad and murdering people is a very high form
of self-denial, indeed. But, in all circumstances, is It
not a pity that the white robes of Religion should bo
dragged in the mire by th s rabble of holy rascals ?
Yet, perhaps, it is just as well. Those who are fools
enough to follow, or anaves enough to encourage them,
would be damned, anyhow. 8.ill, we would like to have
a few martyrdoms just to hurry the thing up.

The following little incidents form a neat
obituary far the present Licensing Act. Thousands of
min Purchased liquor in hotels on Good Friday, during
the hoars allowed, and stopping across the threshold
of the pub door drank with freedom. We wonder what
blaokhole of idioey and holy prejudice fastened into
the legislature of this young country such an arrange-
ment as this. A howling crime to dunk inside I An-
other abomination of tho Act is to make every hotel-
keener a suspect, and every policeman a sneak. Last
Good Friday, lots of policemen in disguise rushed into
hotels to detect infringements of the law, but went out
arain with their thirst for revenge unslaked. Two or
taree cubes have been reported where the behaviour of
policemen in disguise going into an hotel was the be-
haviour of suspected thieves, and it was rather iortu-
asto the revolver was not oal.ed into use. Hotel-Keep-
kg is legal or it is illegal, and an hotel-keeper's house
la as sacred in its privacy as a Darling Point mansion.
In Woslloomooloo, a policeman, disguised as a drunken
digger, staggered into an hotel, hue was disappointed.
It’s good that an amendment of the law lessens the use
of firearms for such canaille.
Talking of Mrs. Langtry, says a London cor-
respondent of *n American paper, under date January
1 brings to mind the fact ,hat her friendsherer-and
she has not a few—have been greatly exercised over her
recent breach with Mrs. and there is un-
Questionably a considerable revulsion of feeling in
Sigh places against the Jersey Lily in consequence.
Indeed, hard y anything else is talked about in tho
clubs and drawing-rooms, and friends who stood up
firm in her behalf during ihe many scandalous vieissi-
♦udea through which her name and fame have been
dragged during her five years' career in London as a
professional beauty, have begun to waver. People
who excised her forward, romping manners ®n the
tom-boyish habits of her girluood s days, when she
roved about St. Hilliers untrammelled, and, seem-
lugly, unoorrected, are beginning to think that
there was more fact than fiction in the many
and varied somdals which have from time to time
been set afloat about her in London than was at the
time believed; and tho old affair of the two divorce
gaits brought together by Mr. Langtry and Major Corn,
wallis-West, respectively, in which the Prince at Wales
nndthe late scapegrace, Earl of Lonsdale, were co-
respondents, has been unearthed and talked over witha
decided sympathy for the unfortunate editor of the
London Tows Talk, who got flftioa months' imprison-
ment with hard labour lor publishing the facts of the
ease It was a sad commentary on tho law ridden c' n-
dition of the English press, for though the Pj mee of
Wales’ influence is such that few people dared to openly
dissent from the justice of the judgment and sentence,
it was, and has b* en, a weU-knQ An fact in journalistic
circles that the initial papers of both divorce suite were
Hied in the Probate and Divorce Registry office at
Somerset House, but that-npon the scandal reaching
the sirs of those moat affected, or likely to be, by the
actions, influences of a sufficiently powerful character
were quickly exerted, not only to compromise the suits,
but to eradicate from the records of the court every
trace of the proceedings that had been brought.
That distinguished member of tho Prince of
Wale#' gat, the Earl of Aylesford, has been travelling
of Kte, lor his country’s good, in America. He is a
charming fellow, 34 years of age In 1871 he married a
Miss E iith Williams, daughter of Colonel Peers V\ il.
hams, M P. for Great Marlow for nearly fifty years.
This family of Williams bore a reputation toinewhat
similar to that of the Pagets, of whom it has been said
that all the men are cowards, and all the women—hem 1
Miss Williams had the character of being silly and
extravagant She had scarcely become a bride when
her husband sucoovded his father as Earl of Aylesford,
end it transpired that he was so deep in the books of
the Jews that his succession was more likely to wind
him up than benefit him. He was not thio-siinnad,
however, so he brought a suit in Cnancery to be re-
lieved of his obligations, oa the score of usuriois
Interest. The expedient was successful, in a sense.
The exposures at tho trial were withering Lord Chan-
cellor eelbowe, while he decided that it was “ agree-
able to equity" that the ruinous rate of interest
should be declared null and void, took occasion, when
rendering his decision, to give Lord Aylesford one of
the severest and most caustic lectures on dishonesty
■ud blackguardism it was ever the lot of one nobleman
to receive from another; so that, though the unscru-
pulous young spendthrift got off paying his debts in
lull, his name has never recovered from the tarnish of
Lord Salborne’s merited rebuke. Throughout the
whole business, the Prince of Wales was Lord Ayles-
tord's steadfast friend—as he was of Valentine Baker;
and, despite the scandal which the Lord Chancellor's
scorching words made it impossible to keep private,
retained him as a shining member of his set, not
only visiting him at his teat, Paokington Hall, ia
company with about as fast a party as the present
court circle could produce (which is saying a good
final), but taking tho Princess with him. In 1875
when the Prince visited India, Lord Ayletford was
of course ona of his suite. The Prince couldn’t live
without his Aylesford. While His Lordship was in the
hot country. Her Lad. ship was making It quite as warm
in England, and finished off, j ust before her husband re-
turned, by bolting with the most noble the Marquis of
Blaudford, eldest son of the Duke of Marlborough, and
Uont the most astonishing titled blackguard of thoday.
Blamlford was himself a married man at the time, but
his wife was a decent woman, and consequently there
was no affinity between the pair. Lord Aylesford
brought a divorce soil against his spouse, with Lord
Blandford as co-respondent, and several ether person-
's®8 of higher rank in the peerage, as possible partners
m the defence. The suit promised prime food for gossip
Md scandal, but, tat some reason best known to the
Illustrious parties concerned, it was suddenly disoon-
tuumd by ookaent, and the whole matter hushed up.
Jbord Aylesford doesn’t seom to give himself mash moo.
rad eonoeru over his affairs, either domestic or flaancial,
though both are in about the same sorry condition. By
■pedal act of Parliament, passed in August last, tho
bdmialiiration of his estate was placed in the hands of
trustees, with power to raise money to satisfy his debts,
*nd u the meantime he amuses himpelf, with foreign

stomach. A great puff of steam, a shrill whistle, and
the steam-man stopped short, never to go again
