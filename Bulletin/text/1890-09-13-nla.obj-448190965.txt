- HOUSEHOLD— especially where
there are young cnilclren— should he provided
with Ayer’s Cherry Pectoral, the prompt use of
which has saved innumerable lives. Its effect
is immediate and certain. It stops coughing, pro-
motes expectoration, and soothes the irritated
membrane. The most famous and successful
Cough-Cure
in the world, It has no equal as a remedy for
asthma, bronchitis, inflamed tonsils, loss of
voice, whooping-cough, croup, and the sudden
pulmonary complaints to which children are
liable. Taken in the early stages of consump-
tion, it often cures that disease and always
checks its progress; and even at a later period
in the malady, it relieves the distressing cough
and induces needful repose. A safe, palatable,
and economical medicine, Ayer’s Cherry Pecto-
ral should be always at hand in case of an un-
foreseen and sudden emergency.

WHO IS

o
Nervous & Debilitated
Who in his youth has trifled away his vigour of body,
mind, and manhood, should consult PROFESSOR
CARL STINEWAY, the Eminent Specialist,
in diseases of the Genito-Urinary Organs, who is
still treating with the greatest skill and success all
Private, Nervous and Chronic Diseases.
Professor STINEWAY'S success, which has
become so firmly established throughout Australasia,
is based upon the facts ist. That every case treated,
even in its most remote effects, is specially
thus starting aright. 2nd. The Medicines used are
exactly adapted to suit the case, and are compounded
from the purest, freshest, and refined ingredients,
thus promptly producing results without overdosing
or injury.
I seek cases where all else has failed,
Young and middle-aged men and others, who
suffer from. Nervous and Physical Debility,
Exhausted Vitality, Premature Decline, etc.,
can recover the same degree of health, strength,
and energy experienced in former years, by
consulting (in person or by letter, which is
free), Professor STINEWAY , who has re-
stored thousands of sufferers to vigorous man-
hood after all other treatment had failed. It
makes no difference what you have taken, or
who has failed to cure you. Cases that I accept
for treatment are quickly and permanently
cured.
DO ANY OF THE FOLLOWING SYMPTOMS,
OR CLASS OF SYMPTOMS MEET YOUR
DISEASED CONDITION Are you a sufferer
from bad health in any of its many forms, consequent
on a lingering Ncryous, Chronic, or Functional
Disease ? Do you feel nervous, debilitated, fretful,
timid, and lack the power of will and action ?
Are you subject to loss of memory ; have spells of
fainting ; fullness of blood in the head ; feel listless,
moping, unfit for business or pleasure, and subject to
fits of melancholy? Are your kidneys, stomach,
urinary organs, liver, or blood in a disordered con-
dition ? Do you suffer from Rheumatism,- Neuralgia,
or other aches and pains? Are you timid, nervous,
and forgetful with your mind continually dwelling on
the subject? Have you lost confidence in yourself,
and energy for business pursuits ? Are you subject
to restless nights, broken sleep, dreams, palpitation
of the heart, bashfulness, confusion of ideas, aversion
to society, dizziness in the head, dimness of sight,
pimples on the face and back, and other desponding
symptoms ? If you are afflicted, why further neglect
your health or future happiness, when by a single con-
sultation (which costs nothing) you can be placed on
the way to health, strength, apd vigour ?■
All correspondence held sacred. A speedy
and perfect life cure is guaranteed in all cases
I undertake, where doubt exists the sufferer is
frankly informed.
Persons living at a distance who desire
treatment without delay can, by forwarding a
full description of their case and £l, receive
by return of post the medicines required.
Do not despair, even though all others have
failed in your case. No matter what your
complaint may he, call or write—l will cure
you. If you are ill, do not delay !My vast
experience enables me to guarantee a positive
cure in all cases undertaken. CONSUL-

Western Australia is a much richer colony than is
generally supposed as regards minerals, agriculture and
pastoralism.—Sir Samuel Griffith.
Professor Brown, of Victoria, who made a thorough
examination of the south-western portion of Western
Australia, states that not the other colonies only, but
even the people of Western Australia evidently do not
know how much there is waiting for development. He
saw thousands of acres in contiguous blocks of fine choco-
late lands, light clay loams, and peaty soils. He thinks
the important features of the district are its grand climate
and regular rainfall.

SWORN CERTIFICATE.— One of Thousand* more.
Noble-street, Newton, Geelong,
10th December, 1888.
To H. F. Kugklmann, Esq.
Dear Sir, —This is to certify that I, Patrick Keenan, was
taken ill about three years ago with a severe cold, which
turned into Bronchitis and became chronic. I consulted
inure than one doctor, and during that time took a great
quantity of medicine without it doing me the slightest
good, hut I became worse every day, wasting away until
I became a perfect skeleton. About February last I began
to spit up blood, and what with the cough and severe
pains in my left lung, and the quantity of bad matter I
was expectorating every day, I became very much alarmed.
Hearing of your professional skill I consulted you, and
you told me you could cure me for a given sum. I agreed
and went under your treatment in March last. At the
end of three months I was taken bad one morning, and
vomited about two pints of blood, matter and stringy
phlegm. From that time I commenced to improve, and
was gaining in weight every day. About a month ago the
blood ceased coming, the cough disappeared, and the
lung healed completely, and thank God and your pro-
fessional skill, I am as well as ever,
P. KEENAN.

Justices of the Peace, for the Southern Bailiwick, in the
County of Grant, this 10th day of December, 1888.

Dr. PERRY invites the fidlest investigation into his

each Case, and in all cases tells the Patient the exact
nature of his complaint, the cost of a cure, and the time
it will take.

SATURDAY, SEPTEMBER 13, 1890.
“When this Cruel War is Over!”
The long agony endured by the people of
the dis-United States of America during the
continuance of their protracted civil war
found expression, as always happens in such
cases, in the lamentations of poets and the
wailings of musicians. A languid breeze of
pathetic ballads, set to sobbing airs, breathed
throughout the continent. The mournful
cadences were sighed in melodious grief in
millions of desolated or anxious households.
The tortured nation evinced and relieved its
sufferings by the universality of such harmoni-
ous heart-throbs. Among the most touchingof
a multitude of such ballads there is one
known by the initial line of the poetry:
“When this Cruel War is over.” Brief as
has yet been the period of t the contention
justly styled the Great Strike, in Australia,
the sentiments of all the more temperate
among the people and the speculations of the
more thoughtful, already begin to drift in the
direction which those words express. Every
man of feeling longs for the cessation of the
acute stage of strife. None but the super-
ficial imagine that the settlement of the
strike will signify the cessation of the
struggle. The strike, in fact, is not the
disease from which the body-politic is suffer-
ing. It is but a symptom, unpleasant and
painful in itself undoubtedly, but still only a
symptom. Pustules are very offensive and
inconvenient. But it- is the constitutional
derangement which is really the malady of
a small-pox patient. The eruptions are
indicative of the nature of the disease, and,
revolting as they are, of themselves, they
constitute a hopeful sign. If these indica-
tions fail to appear the physician is liable and
apt to make a false diagnosis and prescribe a
fatal treatment. Suppress these outbreak-
ings—the constitution is destroyed and the
patient expires.
* * #
When the subject of the socio-political
disturbance affecting civilised communities
in general is thus comprehensively regarded,
it is readily understood that it matters very
little in what fashion the existing eruption
may come to an end. It is but a pimple on
the body afflicted. There occurred in Great
Britain alone, during the period from 1840
to 1877 (the latest statistics we can lay hands
on relating to this subject) no less than 2352
strikes. But there has been only one
malady. The question really deserving of
attention is—in what manner will that
malady terminate ? The first steps towards
a solution of this question must of course be
to ascertain what the malady actually is, and
the next to investigate its causes. There is
general agreement as to the character of the
disease. It is a social fever. The sufferer—
Civilised Society—is restless, irritable, sub-
ject to convulsions almost epileptic in their
character, the patient losing sense and biting
his own tongue in the paroxysms. He
is afflicted with terrible waste of sub-
stance, with general lowness of spirits oc-
casionally intensified to sheer hopelessness,
with intermittent reactions of irrational
gaiety and sanguineness. The treatment
hitherto recommended and adopted by the
physicians has been very nearly identical
with that period approved for bodily
derangements of all kinds indiscriminately.
In the days of our grandfathers, if a man
had a bilious attack the doctor whipped out
a lancet and bled him. If he broke his leg,
he was bled. If he had a fever, he was
bled. If he were in a condition of collapse
from cholera, he was bled. If a wretch
fainted in the street owing to starvation, he
was promptly relieved of half-a-pint of blood.
If one broke a blood-vessel, the chances
were ten to one that the first practitioner
who got at him would instantly bleed him.
* * *
Those pretenders to skill in treating the
derangements of society—Monarchs and
Ministers—are yet scarcely emerging from
that ridiculous condition of ignorant empiri-
cism from which the medical profession has
extricated itself. The physician and the
surgeon of to-day look back with shame and
indignation upon the brutal practices and
unwarrantable presumption of their by no
means remote predecessors. But the social
physicians are still the arrogant, pretentious
humbugs that these diplomaed quacks
were. They still prescribe blood-letting
for every complaint. Their faith in the
efficacy of the remedy has, it is true, begun
to waver. But on all occasions when they
find themselves nonplussed, and really can-
not conceive what they should properly do,
they take out the lancet and the actual
cautery. Steel and fire, the bayonet and
the cartridge, these are the last resource of
the Governmental quacks, even when they
are not the first. No better illustration of
this tendency is needed than the present
attitude of the Governments of New South
Wales and Victoria. In Sydney and in
Newcastle the troops are readied up, ball-
cartridge is parcelled out, the commanders
of the British war-ships are invoked to be
ready to invade the country with alien blue-
jackets and machine-guns from Woolwich.
In Victoria the soldiery are even more pro-
minently in evidence. In short, the Govern-
ment Sangrado has his lancets out of their
case, and, if the patient takes a bad turn,
the Hon. Sangrado will have his blood
sooner than confess his own incompetence.
# #
Meanwhile a new school of practitioners is
steadily working its way towards acceptance
and appears destined, ere long, to take the
place of the habit-encrusted disciples of the
old formulas. This school it is which pro-
nounces that curing some diseases is for the
most part hopeless, once they enter the
system. Their doctrine is emphatically
that prevention is the true method. If
it be sought to have a healthy com-
munity and to ensure reasonable freedom
from epidemics of a distressing or violent
character, the conditions which generate and
foster such epidemics must be sought for,
ascertained, and eradicated. They profess
to have diagnosed the disease which so
severely affects modern society. It is, they
say, the unequal distribution of wealth—of
all those things, circumstances, and condi-
tions which tend to make entire peoples
comfortable and contented. They point out
that the old blood-spilling practice has abso-
lutely failed—that even when not followed
by fatal consequences, the utmost it has ac-
complished has been to reduce the patient
to a state of transient feebleness, and that
with the restoration of vigour the original
malady has never failed in one single in-
stance to reappear with aggravated intensity.
With unblenching persistency they proceed
to elaborate their modern system, and every
day they gain consideration. At the outset
the public, long accustomed to defer with
almost superstitious awe to the grave pre-
tensions of the pompous practitioners who
supplanted their authority with diplomas
endorsed by ancient usage, and had on their
side all the respectability of big practices,
fine appointments, and responsible profes-
sorial station, looked askance at these new
aspirants, who ventured to proffer advice
without producing vouchers from any recog-
nised stagnant university or decayed school.
But by sheer force of reason and by unim-
peachable demonstration of exceptional abili-
ties, the new school of political teachers have
won their way. Proudhon, Louis Blanc,
and St. Simon have survived the fire of de-
nunciation and affected contempt which
enwrapt their systems for long years. Rous-
seau becomes so increasingly esteemed that
it is felt necessary to revive to-day in refer-
ence to his ideas the attacks which more than
a hundred years ago were directed at his
individuality.? Lassalle and Marx are
names known all the civilised world over.
Among living Englishmen the names of
Hyndman and Morris are nearly as well
known as those of Disraeli and Gladstone,
while that ©f Henry George is fully as well
known. Complete identity of opinion in
matters of detail has not been established
among these teachers. But in this general
principles they are in substantial accord.
Without exception they pronounce that a
healthy Society cannot be expected -unless
those inequalities of condition which deprave
one section by the possession of dropsical
superfluity, another section by the emacia-
tion of painful deprivation, and all by the
fever of perpetual striving, anxiety or sus-
picion, be extirpated and removed.
* * *
Hence it may be understood that while
the success of the great Australian strike
may in some slight degree advance the
period when relief will come to modern
society, its repression would in no wise tend
to an amelioration. It would only drive
inwards an external manifestation, with the
certain result of an aggravation and intensi-
fication of the actual trouble. At the same
time, it would be folly to expect more than
almost imperceptible amelioration of the
general condition from a successful issue of
the Australian effort. Trades-Unionism is
but one ingredient in a compound remedy,
just as Land Nationalisation is another single
ingredient. Each is beneficial in its degree,
and tire latter is essential. But without
other accessories Both would prove inade-
quate. Let it be supposed that Trades-
Unionism were to secure a victory all along
the line. There could be no permanence in
its success. This truth is neatly exemplified
by the case of the London Dock Labourers’
Union. That stands flushed with all the
glow of a recent triumph. Yet at this
moment, after the lapse of but a few months,
the Union totters. It already changes its
character. In lieu of being a combination
to secure to labourers better wages and more
regular employment, it now has assumed
the aspect of a monopolist guild, which re-
fuses to admit to participation any out-
side labour. But outside labour, desperate
and starving, clamours tor admission.
If this demand be acceded to, there will
no longer be employment enough for all
members. If it be refused, the employer
will be able to break down the Union by
availing himself of the men excluded. And
what is true of one Union is true of all, in
this respect.
* # #
Were all the labour in the world to
organise into trades-unions, there would
be the same surplus of unemployed as
there is to-day. And whenever there is a
surplus of unemployed, other conditions re-
maining as they are, wages must fall. For
it matters not at all whether the Union
worker labours fewer hours, at so much per
hour, in order to share out employment
among his mates, or whether working full
time, while his mates remain idle, he con-
tributes to their maintenance. It is true,
indeed, that were all workers banded
together in unions they could demand that
all should share what employment there was,
and that every man should be paid, no
matter how short his hours of work, a wage
adequate to support him in decency and com-
fort. But, unluckily, under existing arrange-
ments, however willing employers might be
to concede these demands rather than to give
up business, they could not make occupation
for all claimants and pay them wages. The
matter is very simply demonstrable. Every
employer seeks to increase the number of his
hands, because he makes some profit on each
individual he employs. If he could increase
his hands he would do so without com-
pulsion. But he does not —because he
cannot. And no compulsion could make
him. In reality there is little jus-
tice in the vindictiveness witli which
employers in general are regarded. Some
deserve it, indeed, on account of their per-
sonal arrogance and griping practices. But
the best and most generous of employers is
restricted in his opportunities of liberality.
If he pay high wages, he contracts his profits.
If he contract his profits, he is less able to
avail himself of opportunities as they arise,
in the way of renewing plant, of introducing
fresh inventions and processes, and in a
hundred other ways. And. he who gets
behind in these essentials is in danger of
dropping out of the race altogether. Com-
petitors undersell him, and his business is
ruined.
* * *
The remedies lie deeper, and are complex.
Land monopoly must be abolished. Other
monopolies must be repressed, and there-
after competition can be dealt with and
co-operation established in its place. Al-
though the present strike be successful,
nothing will have been permanently gained
unless other and larger victories be won. It
is absurd to imagine that wages can long be
maintained at a high level in Australia if
they be at a low level in Europe. Protec-
tion coupled with Trades-Unionism can
stave off the inevitable for a while. And
during the interval additional measures might
be adopted were the people but properly
acquainted with the steps to be taken.
Meanwhile, the most foolish course possible
would be any recourse to violence. The Aus-
tralian Colonies are but dependencies. It is
now that this humiliating condition is most
keenly realisable. A speaker on a platform
at one of the Sydney demonstrations in-
formed the unionists present that they were
the public. This was a silly mistake. But
even if they were 300,000 against 100,000,
instead of, perhaps, 150,000, including all
sympathisers, against 200,000, and could
support a stone-thrower against the police
with a thousand men, and the police, mili-
tary and special constables (as their oppo-
nents, authorised, organised and armed by
the Government, are styled) with 20,000
men, and overwhelm all their local antago-
nists, they would next have to cope with
the greed and-might of the British Empire.
Some Economic Sophisms.
“The iron law of wages” is one of those
fiscal lies invented by economists for the
dual purpose of reconciling the rich to the
sufferings of the poor, and of reconciling the
latter to their hard lot. The meaning of
the inexorable law mentioned is that wages
can never be depressed beneath the point at
which they will support life. This is false
in two particulars. In the first place, the
law does not apply to those who starve
through being unable to find any work at
all; and secondly, a workman, even when
in constant employment, may have hours so
long, and food so inadequate or unwhole-
some, as to mean for him a short life and a
sad one. This is well put by a recent writer
who says : —*
What is the minimum of income that will support an
individual '/ Evidently it is that which will keep his
system in a good condition, and allow him to develope
fully and attain to the natural limit of his life. As soon
as he attempts more than his system is capable of endur-
ing, or gets less food, warmth, and sleep than his system
requires to remain at the summit of its type, then he
falls into physiological distress. Over-work is as equally
the cause of organic decline as insufficient food, but
the latter is synonymous with slow starvation.
* #
But it is not necessary to go beyond
statistics to see that this “iron law,” which
complacently assumes that every labourer
earns at least as much as will keep his body
in the highest state of efficiency, is funda-
mentally unsound. Recent vital tables show
that the wage-earning classes in European
countries enjoy an average life of from one-
third to one-half less than their well-to-do
fellow-countrymen. Yet all live in the same
land, with the same sky above and the same
soil below. What is the cause of this fearful
mortality that robs the workman not alone
of the pleasures of life, but of a considerable
portion of life itself 1 Long hours, insuffi-
cient or insufficiently-nutritious food, occa-
sional spells of actual hunger, and insanitary
surroundings from his cradle. It is only
necessary to wander through the slums of
any great English or European city to see that
the conditions under which vast masses of men
live are far worse than those which surround
the life of the savage. This state of things
has not yet reached Australia, but it is
fairly on the way. So far, then, as Europe
is concerned, the “iron law of wages” is a
transparent fraud. And if the workmen on
this side of the world are not careful and
loyal to each other, the time may come when
its falsity will be proved by sad experience
in what within twenty years will, we hope,
be the Australian Republic.
** , *
Two other economic fallacies lie on the
surface. They have been repeated so often,
have so frequently passed from mouth to
mouth or from writer to writer, that simple
people are half inclined to believe them
much as many simple people to this day
believe in that most vulgar of all blasphemies
—the divine right of kings. The fallacies
alluded to are (a) that pauperism began with
the advent of man himself, and (6) that in
earlier ages of the world the disproportion
between rich and poor was even greater than
now. In the world’s earlier ages pauperism,
as we are familiar with it, was unknown.
A strong or unscrupulous people might over-
come a weak and carry them into slavery ;
but if they made them work they at least fed
them well. Besides, poverty is both abso-
lute and relative. The England of the 14th
and 15th centuries was a much poorer
country than the England of to-day. But
the physical well-being of the workers from
the hind up was far superior to what it is
now. This has been abundantly proved by
the researches of Professor Thorold Rogers.
So long as a man can so fully supply his physi-
cal wants so that by abundant food, vest and
leisure his organism has a chance of coming
to its fullest maturity he cannot bo called
poor, even if clad in home-spun and un-
acquainted with the thousand-and-one in-
ventions of science for making life agreeable.
But to tell a starving man that he cannot
be. poor, must be prosperous, for his native
land exported a hundred millions worth of
goods and imported a similar amount during
the year; to argue that peasants of the present
can obtain luxuries unknown to monarchs
of the past is cruelty run mad.
* * *
Absolute poverty is a different thing. It
is a product of our modern civilisation. You
feel no compassion for the relatively poor
man. Diogenes was not remarkably wealthy,
but, from all accounts, he seems to have
been remarkably comfortable. The world
still contains many savage and semi-savage
nations, whose inhabitants, although rela-
tively poor in the main, neither expect nor
desire sympathy. Nature informs them
when they are hungry, and experience
teaches them how to get over the incon-
venience. But a highly-developed civilisa-
tion on the present lines invariably condemns
a large proportion of every nation to abso-
lute poverty—to that physiological distress
which renders such words as “manhood,”
“self-respect,” and “independence” mere
expressions of mockery. This is a fact that
cannot be gainsaid, that no sophistry will
dissipate, and that is forcing itself daily upon
the notice of those who—wedded to the old
theories of supply and demand, of unlimited
production and constant cheapening —vainly
endeavour to close the door against its un-
welcome entrance. The real question, then,
is : Can such a state of things be altered. 1 Is
it necessary that many, or any, should perish
in order that many, or any, should ostenta-
tiously flourish?
# * *
There remains the other blunder—that in
the world’s earlier ages the disproportion


betweeii rich and poor was even greater than
now. If anything, this is more glaring than
the preceding. Asa recent author puts it a
little brusquely : “It is all only a trumped-
up, learixed fraud.” No medieval fortunes
were lit to be named beside the American
and European hoards of to-day. Even in
Old Rome, when a consul returned with the
plunder of a province, he usually lost both
it and his life together. Very little of it
came to his offsprixxg, except when they were
extremely alert and, in more senses than
one, were in at their father’s death. But at
present there are, as our author points
out, scattered thx’ough the world not
alone millionaires by the hundred, but
thousands upon thousands of people with
princely fortunes and incomes. These are
the people who, for old fiddles axxd old china,
give sums that would feed many faxxxilies for
life. It is in the face of facts like these —
that never befox’e in the world’s history were
there so many enorxxxously rich people, and
never before such a multitude of abjectly
poor —that political economists of the dainty
modern type have the assurance to proclaim
the glad tidings of the gradually-narrowing
disproportion between rich and poor. Any-
one who undex’stands the case can confidently
give to this a flat contradition.
* * *
Almost at the same moment two essayists,
one tlxe American Bellamy, the other the
Hungarian Max IS ordau, have dealt at length
with the lamentable state of things at present
existing. There is as great a difference between
the books asbetween their methods, foroptim-
ism is the dominant xxote in one and pessimism
in the other. Yet, even in “Looking Back-
ward,” whose object is to teach that it is
possible to lay the foundations of a society
not, as at present, in human baseness, but in
human virtue, there are many passages
which make one ask “is it so visionary to
think that such a state of things could be 1”
Men like Bismarck deride the idea—utterly
contemn it when they stoop to mention it at
all. The Napoleons, Fredericks and
(Lesars of the past as well as the Jay Goulds,
Vanderbilts and Rothschilds of the present
would certainly act in the same way and
think that the place Socialists would best
adorn would be a cart’s tail. Why 1 Bis-
marck himself told us the other day that So-
cialism would bring all men down to a dead
level, and give no proper scope for ambition.
This is delicious. It would certainly bring
kaisers and statesmen to their proper level,
prevent their hounding on millions to throttle
each other, and banish hunger from the face
of the earth. But fancy anyone declaring
there would be no scope for ambition in a
society that gave to all a chance of venturing
their speed and bottom on the illimitable
highways of literature, science, art, and in-
vention ! So far from giving no scope for
ambition, it would give to multitudes chances
for which they vainly strain and hunger under
existing conditions. Suppose the Bismarcks
and Krupps did fail in the race % They could
always fall back into the positions Nature in-
tended them to fill, and pass their timo com-
fortably in healthy manual labour.
* * *
M. Nordau’s work, of which we print a
first instalment in this issue of The Bulletin,
is of an entirely different order. It is the
carefully-written work of a subtle thinker,
and has power stamped upon every line.
What is M. Nordau’s panacea for the
world’s ills ? Briefly this —“The right of
inheritance must be abolished.” This is
precisely what Bellamy says—the difference
txeing that the Hungarian would abolish it
while preserving Individualism, the Ameri-
can while introducing Socialism. Which is
right ? We lean to the American side. But
in neither case can the desired result be
brought about without a long and bitter
struggle —a struggle whose end is certain,
but whose course and period no man can
foresee. There must be a welding together
of all wage-earners—not of those who work
with their hands alone, who wield the pick
and the hammer, but of those far less for-
tunate and less independent ones who spend
their lives in shop, factory, or office. Nothing
could withstand such a combination. There
would quickly be a Parliament vociferous ixx
the cause of Labour. Everything else would
follow in its proper place. Can such a con-
summation be attaixxed ? It is the opinion
of practical men that it can.
On Bad Liquor and other Matters.
The human race drinks a good deal too much,
and the world’s old maiden aunt is harassed
thereby. The teetotal cause is vastly stronger
than it was ten years ago, and at the same time
the national drink-bill is a great deal larger.
The demand for anti-liquor legislation and the
demand for liquor keep oh growing together.
There is a coxxstantly ixxcreasing trade in those
good little books and snuffle-busting pamphlets,
ixx which Thomas J ones is represented as coxxxing
home to his once happy domicile, and runxxixxg
amok among the furniture with an axe; but
they appear to leave xxo perceptible effect behind
them. Yet the attractioxxs of drink, so far as
they are visible to any intelligent understand-
ing, are rather diminishing than increasing.
Whisky, as a rule, is partly kerosene and the
rest liquid fire, and to the persoxx who meets it for
the first time, it resembles nothing so much as
a live lobster swallowed with the claws fore-
most. Brandy and the rich old wines of Europe
labour under a serious disadvantage, inasmuch
as the quantity openly produced is only one-
third or thereabouts of the amount coxxsumed,
and where the balance comes from no one knows.
The vine-clad slopes where xxxost of the world’s
liquor is produced are situated up three pairs of
stairs in a back-slum, axxd the unwashed culti-
vator sleeps oxx top of the vintages, and the
mellow sunshine which ripens the harvest is
kept in a keg, and the poetry and bright romance
of the wine-cup are bought at the chemical
factory round the comer. Yet the world hangs
on tenaciously to its kerosene and carriage-
varnish, axxd the world’s old maidexx aunt bangs
herself about to very little purpose. Teetotalism
is spreading and so is liquor, and it is difficult
to say w hich is spreading the faster.
* * #
The fact is that a great deal too much of the
religious element is imported into the contest.
Teetotalism should take its staxxd solely oxx
three simple truths—first, that the huxxxan in-
side is not strong enough to exxdure a coxxstaxxt
swallowing of explosives and combustibles;
aecoxxd, that if the world insists on devouring
about twice as much liquor as it can conveniently
supply, it must not be surprised when it finds
that it is consuming all sorts of substances that
are about as wholesome as pounded glass ; and
third, that ixx any case the humaix race can’t
afford the bill. On these three issues there is
room to conduct a square and honourable con-
test, and the long-tailed coat and holy hymxx
which are so extensively imported into the dis-
cussioxx are merely so much extraneous idiocy.
If gin, as compounded nowadays, produces a
xxefarious action on the liver, the public may be
interested in the fact, but the observations on
the drink question which Solomon left behind
him have no effect either when applied in-
ternally or rxxbbed on outside. The only
tangible result is that one sectioxx of the com-
munity spends its time in hunting for verses in
condemnatioxx of rum axxd similar fluids, and
another section wastes its energies searching
for quotations in support of them, and both
pax’ties meet with a reasonable amount of
success. Then the question dribbles into all
manner of side issues, and presently all chance
of an improvement in the quality of “ colonial
beer ” is indefinitely postponed on account of a
difficulty about the pants of the ancient
prophets, or the authenticity of the second
epistle of Peter, or some equally thrilling
problem of aixeient date. The mere fact
that the men who pray endeavour to arrogate
to themselves the sole right to refornx a world
which drinks too much, makes it tolerably cer-
tain that the men who swear will take the
opposite view, and the latter are always much
the more numerous and interesting section of
the two. It is pleasanter axxd much more
agreeable to take to drink, even whexx there is
more thaxx a suspicion of kerosene in the flowing
bowl, than to follow a person with a great, sad
expaxxse of shirt-collar and a corporation which
is blown out with beef and tea and buns, and
a Scripture sticking obtrusively out of the hind-
pocket of a doleful-coloured tail-coat, and a fat,
patronising utterance and a wearisome text
which is always ready to be heaved at the
sinner. The average temperance apostle is an
individual who makes the world feel very tired,
* * #
Teetotal literature, too, falls flat on account
of its exceeding solemnity. There never was a
humorous observatioxx in all the hundred thou-
sand weary, tear-sodden volumes which exhibit
the cussedness of drink to a lachrymose world.
The Church never made a joke in its life, and
seldom appreciated one, and the Church ixxsists
on editing teetotalism till it leaves nothing ixx it
but dxxst and ashes. Now and then the temper-
ance journal attempts to lighten up its pages by
a profound, abysmal, bottomless article on the
disgraceful condition of the kidney of some
drunkard who died miserably and was dissected
at the hospital, but anybody, except the tee-
total fanatic who wrote the thing, is apt to con-
sider, after reading it, that some more success-
ful way of illuminating the earth might be
discovered by a little vigorous research. Ex-
cepting a funeral, with a ton of paving-stones
on top of it, there is xxothing heavier on earth
than a temperaxxce exhortation, and then before
the effort gets into print it is edited by some
weeping apostle or saved undertaker, who
paints it a deeper black than it was before, and
throws sundry new shades over it, and buries it
a hundred fathoms deep in a sepulchre of type,
and mourns grievously over its last resting-
place. The joys that lie in pernicious beer,
and whisky adulterated with lightning, may be
limited, but even aloes or castor-oil are xxxore
cheerful than the outpourings of the teetotal
edition ; and the horrible solemnity which en-
shrines the cause is a difficulty of xxo ordinary
kind.
# # *
Good liquor, as a rule, is ruinously expexxsive,
and our interest in bad liquor is limited, for we
prefer to die by some shorter and less obtrusive
xnethod. The Australian publican, regarded as
a man and a brother, is a failure ; he is unwhole-
some and puffy and fat, axxd not calculated to
adorn a summer landscape. His bar is generally
dingy and gritty, axxd tlxe malarious loafer who
haunts it is unpicturesque and offensive, axxd
the barmaid who attends it is a hopeless
and heartless deceiver. Liquor, ixx general,
is a curse, and teetotalism is another.
The prospect of a world that is filled with
hiccups and whose feet are tied ixp ixx a hard
knot is eminently offensive, the dream of a
world of teetotal drivel and cold tea is, if
possible, a shade worse. If drink axxd teetotal-
ism could be wiped out simultaneously, and the
bar and the pioxxs bixxx-struggle could go together,
axxd the public-house blasphemy and the washy
temperance tract were both extinct literature,
and the dethroned barmaid would marry the
superfluous temperance lectux’er, and they would
go away axxd make a respectable livelihood in
soxxxe place whex’e they would xxever draw public
attention any mox’e or rouse any further con-
troversy, then a golden age of peace and rest
woxxld dawn upoxx this troubled earth.
* # *
If the teetotaller is willing to jxxstify his fad
by obtaining reasonable compeixsatioxx to the men
whose property he desires to confiscate, then we
cordially invite him to go on with his labours
and win if he can—and if he loses instead it
will suit us equally well. If it were possible
that both factions could lose our satisfaction
would be complete, but at least there is gratifi-
cation in the knowledge that both cannot
possibly win. But to the teetotaller who howls
for confiscation and ruin, and illustrates his
position by tales concei’ning the holy mission of
Joshua, and the necessity of extirpating the
Amalekites, we can only point out that frenzy
of this kind is out of date, and when a Joshua
goes forth to extirpate an Amalekite in these
days he is apt to be hanged for his enthusiasm.
But so long as this scriptural afflatus is not im-
ported into the contest we can cheerfully stand
aside and let matters take their own course. If
the public demands refreshment for man and
beast—and particularly for beast, as he is much
the more numerous of the two—it will probably
succeed in obtaining it, and if there is a wide-
spread feeling in favour of something more
cheering than cold tea the natural law of supply
and demand will doubtless meet the emergency.
Therefore we present our whole-souled curse to
both combataxxts—to the maxx who compounds
bad liquor, axxd the man who seeks to abolish
good—and trust that like the rain it may affect
them both alike. If two Chinamen choose to
fight it is a matter of small importance to any
average white maxx which Mongol gets oxx top.
And if the relevancy of this remark* should fail
to strike many of our readers we can only
lament the fact that teetotalism and dubious
colonial beer both lead to density of intellect
and that each unfits its victim to comprehend
an intelligent observation when it is placed
before his muddled eye.
A Legal Swindle.
A Bill was lately introduced into the New
South Wales Legislative Council by Mr.
Trickett to amalgamate the legal professions,
and was so framed as to do it thoroughly. Its
effect would have been to efface altogether the
distinction between the lawyer in a wig and the
lawyer without one. Had it passed there would
have been nothing to prevent any solicitor from
instructing the Full Court in the proper con-
struction of the Act 28 Geo. IV., c. 655, in the
light of Privy Council’s decision in ex parte
Pokehorney, with all the jaunty confidence of
the young gentleman who put on his horsehair
for the first time the week before last; and this
young gentleman in his turn would have had all
the law could give him—for the protection of
the public—in converting his clients’ securities
into cash for use at Cup-time. The Bill cut both
ways. It removed the prohibition against a
solicitor’s putting his case before the Supreme
Court without the intervention of a barrister;
and it removed the prohibition against a
barrister’s dealing with the public except
through the intervention of an attorney. The
client who employed Mr. Solicitor Trickett
to get up a case might, if he chose, let him see
it through from start to finish without paying a
big fee to Barrister Salomons, Q.C., to “ men-
tion the matter” and otherwise talk to the
judge ; and on the other hand he might employ
Mr. Salomons to attend personally to the whole
thing, and explain his business to that gentle-
man himself, without paying Mr. Trickett to
put it all down on a brief. While the Bill was
in this shape, it met with bald-headed opposi-
tion from the Parliamentary barrister party,
and no secret was made of the intention to
block it in committee. However, just as the
obstruction was about to begin, an amicable
arrangement was made, an amendment blandly
moved by Attorney-General Simpson was agreed
to, and the Bill with the amendment was re-
ported to the House.
The effect of the amendment is simply this:
the distinction between the professions remains
untouched ; the Bill as altered leaves the senior
barrister exactly where he is to-day ; but it
gives the solicitor the right of audience before
the Supreme Court. At first sight this looks
like a concession by the Q.O’s. in the Council,
of the privileges the solicitors wanted, with a
generous waiver of the privileges they were to
have had in return. But first impressions
are misleading ; and the fact that the
alteration of this Bill was the result of an
agreement between lawyers is in itself a
circumstance fraught with the gravest sus-
picion. Judge Windeyer is perfectly right
when he says, in effect, that the senior Bar has
squared matters with the attorneys by throwing
the. junior Bar overboard. There is not a prac-
tising barrister in the New South Wales Upper
House who is not a Q.C. or on the verge of
becoming one, and a Bill like the present one
affects them in a very different way from the
young men whose tailors have to trust to the
precarious fees of the Probate Court. The
original proposal was an honest give and take,
and promised the public a fair show. A solicitor
was to be entitled to do the work for which he
has now to pay a quite unnecessary fee to. a
junior barrister; and the junior barrister, by
way of squaring matters, was to have a chance
to cut into the solicitor’s business. None of the
senior Bar, however, would be touched by that.
No solicitor would think of going into Court to
do the really heavy work for which he now
finds it worth while to fee big men like Salo-
mons or Jack Want ; and, on the other hand,
Salomons and Jack Want, Q.C.’s, couldn’t
afford to fool round with trumpery clients and
collect six-and-eightpences. It is only the
young barrister whose work would be taken
away by the invasion of the unwigged, and only
they who would take advantage of the right to

That is not what was the matter with
the senior Bar. It was none of their
trouble. But what the Bill would have done
with the senior Bar was this. It would have
made them responsible for the work they
are paid to do. It would have interfered with
their little game of “refreshers.” The man in
the silk gown with cases in four courts at once,
besides a consultation in his own chambers
which occupied the whole day, would find that
the guineas marked on his briefs didn’t get into
his bank-account ; if he collected his fees
beforehand he would have to refund them, and
an unfeeling jury would tot up the damages
which his clients had sxxffered from his scamp-
ing their cases. The man who is ready
to work for his money, whether he be a
barrister or a bricklayer, doesn’t object
to taking the responsibility for his work,
and doesn’t undertake three jobs when he know s
he can only thoroughly attend to one of them.
To put the barrister and the bricklayer on the
same footing with respect to their contracts
would promptly distribute the work that is now
scandalously neglected by a half score men at
the Bar, amongst younger men who would
attend to it and would be willing to be respon
sible for it. That was the trouble. That was
the secret of the objection to the Bill on the
part of the senior Bar. And that is what
makes us say there is something fishy about a
compromise which gives the solicitors all they
want, which scrupulously avoids any encroach-
ment on the monopoly enjoyed by the senior
members of the Bar, and which patches up a
peace at the expense of the juniors. The Bill
in its amended form is simply a shameless and
conscienceless put-up job.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Jingoes at Work.
Late intelligence from the New Hebrides is
directed towards giving a spurt to Australian
Jingoism. The settlers in those islands are
represented as being dissatisfied with the
appointment of Dr. Hanedr as French repre-
sentative of New Caledonia, and, through New
Caledonia, of France. It is also stated that a
combination of all the settlers outside of the
“ French Company ” has been formed to agitate
for the annexation of the New Hebrides to
Australia, Even Captain M‘Leod, who was
negotiating to sell his interests to the “ French
Co.,” is “ off ” his proposed bargain, and stands
in with the new Australian px-oject. The pro-
moters ask for an “official representative ” from
Australia. What sort of status in French eyes
would an Australian “ beadle,” or “ consul,” or
“agent” have? Let us talk sense once in a
while. Australia has enough to do to mind her
own business as yet, and her first paramount
duty is to achieve her own freedom—absolute,
untrammelled and isolated. Then, and not till
then, may she consider her own “ Monroe
doctrine ” in all its bearings, together with her
reasonable claims to influence the nearer islands of
the Pacific. Australia has a hard and complicated
battle before her. But the complications force
their own unravelment and thus actually hasten
the day of Australian liberation. Just now the
Imperial faddists are busily at work, and they
have their shadow-echoes numerously and
not uninfluentially represented in Australia.
Parkes’s inglorious scheme of “ Federation
under the Crown ” has evoked a return bark
from Canada’s Sir John Macdonald, Public-
ists, too, are promulgating schemes for the
closer commercial and political alliance between
Australia, Canada, Africa, and India—all as a
subsidiary cob-web to a “ great British Em-
pire.” The strings are pulled by Imperial
Federationists. Let us sniff suspiciously at all
such high-falutin sentiments. An infallible
test is that any scheme that does not offer the
gold of the highest individual and State free-
dom—the government of ourselves by ourselves,
and for ourselves, without reference to anyone
else whomsoever—but presents instead the
tinsel of a gilded-over Imperialistic bondage, is
essentially evil. Meanwhile, let the New
Hebrides work out its own salvation, and let
us work out our’s—not in fear and trembling,
but in hope and confidence.

News of Battle.
There are all manner of warlike demonstrations
in progress in various parts of Australia. The
awkward squad is getting its gun ready, and
Authority, as the friend of Monopoly, is ob-
trusively shining up its battle-axe in readiness
for that revolt which it knows will never come,
and which, if it really did come, would make
Monopoly gather up its carpet-bag and take a
bee-line for the hills. In Melbourne, Sydney,
and other cities the wild note of preparation
fills the aii’, and as no one wants to rise in in-
surrection the rulers of the State feel that it is
safe and convenient to strike a military attitude,
and announce that all insurrection will be
promptly squashed. The undersized softgoods-
clerk has sworn himself in as a special constable,
and it is generally understood that if Anarchy
rears its offensive head he wfill be prepared to
swim in blood. The lumbering money-grabber
has quitted his store or his pawnshop to
rampage round with a baton in the theatre ol
war, and all manner of unwar like heroes are
ready to die or scream, or run away, in defence
of a Constitution which no one is attempting to
attack. Proclamations have been issued here
and there to the effect that if two or more people
are seen landing in one place, and not doing
anything, or if one person is observed standing
anywhere and keeps on remaining in that
attitude, he may be lawfully called upon to
disperse in various directions ; and if he declines
to do so a magistrate shall be authorised to
arrive on the scene and collect an inquiring
crowd by reading aloud a long blue document,
and if the document does not take effect in
fifteen minutes the troops may be called out and
the loafer’s blood will be on his own head. At
any other time and under any other circum-
stances the insurgent would be removed by the
ear to the police court and fined in the sum of
five shillings, but as this is an insurrectionary
epoch in which nobody insurrects it is considered
necessary to lend a certain air of military fervour
to the proceedings. It is even propose'! that a
general mobilisation should take place * Muni-
tions of war are also being hunted up, and the
dyed sawdust which was passed off as gunpowder
has been duly overhauled ; and the big gun,
with the cannon-ball that is six sizes bigger,
and won’t go in in consequence, is getting into
working order, and it has been duly discovered
that the gunner in charge doesn’t know how to
work it; and elaborate measures have been
taken for the defence of the Treasury, lest an
excited ujob should rush in and seize the de-
ficiency Also, paragraphs appear at intervals
in the daily Press setting forth that the various
Governments are filled with the calm of stony
resolution, and are prepared to die at their posts
through old age while waiting for a non-existent
enemy ; and while they are waiting for death
they will continue to draw their salaries and
pickings with that quenchless courage which
always animates the politician on pay-day.
The same heroic solemnity has spread through
the ranks of their subordinates, and the various
departments will present an iron front to the


hordes of spoilers from nine to five as heretofore,
and will fill in their time by sketching barmaids
and actresses on a convenient blotting pad ac-
cording to custom, with that deathless heroism
which is the secret of Britain’s greatness.
Owing to these and other precautions it is
believed that the country may yet be saved,
though no one has discovei'ed why it should
want saving now any more than it does at other
times. And when the danger which never
existed has passed away, and the people who
never dreamt of rising haven’t risen, and the
softgoods counter-jumper lays down his amateur
baton and ceases to be a cheap, unnecessary
hero, and peaee has been restored after being
continued all along, the names of the men who
got up and made an exhibition of themselves to
no purpose will be' embalmed in history, and
they will have their reward in the gratitude of a
«muntry that will never be able to find out what
it has to be grateful,for.
Moral Suasion.
Capital always protests against the pressure of
force. That is to say, it protests against force
when someone else applies it to Capital, and the
peaceful and legitimate pressure which the
trades unions have employed in order to main-
tain their right to co-operate for their own pro-
tection has roused the monopolist press to
frantic indignation. If Labour has any wrongs,
moral suasion should be employed to set them
right ; the inert influence of public opinion
should be brought to bear on the case ; and
argument and rhetoric, and gentle exhortation
should be made use of to bring about a general
reformation. It is true that the monopolist
cares not one straw for moral suasion, and the
weight of 'public opinion has as little influence
on his conscience as a pound of butter might
have if fired at the brazen gates of Tophet, and
argument and rhetoric have no effect on his
bank-account, which is his only vulnerable
point; but he always demands that Labour
should trust to these empty weapons, and be
content. More than a generation ago Charles
Dickens drew a vivid picture of the miseries of
the London deck-labourer—that waif and stray
who slept in a kennel, and lived on a crust, and
gained a miserable pittance by hanging on to
the skirts of commerce. No stronger moral in-
fluence was ever applied in a good cause ; but
though the sympathy thus aroused was illimit-
able, and the air was filled with snuffle and
bogus philanthropy, the dock-labourer was left
as before with his attic and his precarious crust,
until the force of combination did for him
what no amount of sympathy and cheap, un-
considered drivel would ever have effected.
Hood’s pitiful “ Bong of the Shirt ” drew forth
an ocean of wasted tears, and though years
have passed since the world first read it, the
tears are flowing yet —and the unhappy pariah
for whose salvation that sad lament was written,
sews in her lonely room to-day for lower wages
than she received when Hood endeavoured to
arouse the world with the tale of her miseries.
W ALTER Besant, when he wrote the “ Children
of Gibeon,” made a brilliant effort to do what
Hood had failed to accomplish, and as the
result of his endeavours, philanthropic societies
were formed, and pompous addresses delivered,
and secretaries and treasurers and committees
were hired and paid, and the moral atmosphere
was filled with wailing and gas and fat
hypocrisy, and the sewing-woman of Loudon
remains just where she was before. The law
of elevenpence-halfpenny a day for sixteen
hours of weary toil still prevails, for experience
has proved that a woman can live—or rather
exist—and., work for a bloated Christian
employer, and die quietly of cold and misery
and want and premature old age, and be buried
by the parish without any trouble or ungentle-
manly fuss, on that wretched maximum ; and
as woman has never learnt the art of combina-
tion, or discovered how to obtain redress by
Force, she has no prospect of relief except
through outside assistance. But, thanks to
Hood and Besant and other sympathisers, her
employer has been induced, by the influence
of public opinion, to subscribe an in-
finitesimal fraction of the money he has ground
out of his victim to one or other of the
fashionable societies organised for her relief ;
and the secretary has got his salary out of that
subscription, and the committee has used it to
liquidate the bill for the official lunch, and the
printing of the annual report has been charged
against it, and the hungry toiler who paid for
all this thrice-accursed philanthropy remains
hungry and in rags to this day. The amount of
moral suasion contained in such a book as
“ Uncle Tom's Cabin ” was incalculable, but
the work which its author meant to do had to
be done by the Federal bayonets at Gettysburg
and the Wilderness all the same. Victor Hugo
compressed a world of burning woe into “ Les
Miserables” and the “Toilersof the Sea,” and
the result was practically nil. Moral force,
unsupported by the brute strength of numbers
and combined physical effort, is an empty
thing; and the protest of Monopoly against
what it is pleased to term the lawlessness of
Trades-Unionism is merely an invitation to the
masses to spike the only weapon that ever did
or will ever do them any service. In employing
material force by strikes and boycotting,
Labour employs the one argument against which
the rhinoceros-hide is not proof. There is
more knowledge, but no more conscience or
humanity, in the world than there was a cen-
tury ago, and if by any possibility the power of
the Trades Unions could be destroyed, Hood’s
lament would gain a wider application, and the
worker would become again the hopelessly-
degraded slave that he was in the days of old.

Andrew Geddes, a Melbourne City Councillor,
major in the Militia, treasurer of public
charities, and pillar of the Church, has gone to
chokee for three brief months, during which
time he will be carefully preserved from contact
with the common or garden kind of prisoner
who steals boots or chickens, and left to
ruminate over the fact that the Law makes
considerable distinction between Tweedledum
and Tweedledee. Geddes, whose engagements
ran into Heaven knows how much, was charged
with misappropriating a single tenner, and tiie
font of Justice, as represented by J edge Casev,
evidently assumed that the poor councillor
couldn’t help it, and the unfortunate major
deserved much sympathy, and the church-
warden was a persecuted individual. Anyway,
this combination of greatness got off with about
95 per cent, less sentence than is usually served
out to the postman who steals a registered letter,
and a much more genteel form of punish-
ment than descends upon the larrikin,
who says dam within the hearing of the police.
One witness for the defence stated that he
hoped up to the last minute that Geddes’
defalcations would be made good by public
subscription, or some similar means, in which
case the prisoner would have waltzed out of
court without a stain on his character, and
have continued to carry round the Sunday
offertory-dish harder than ever. However, the
excellent Geddes had embezzled a lot
more than could be “ arranged,” so it
became the painful duty of Judge Casey to
pass sentence; and as that stern, unyielding
guardian of morality could make no distinction
between persons—for if he did so “the law would
be brought into disrepute ” —why Geddes got
three solid months of seclusion from the world
and the other prisoners ! The Bulletin doesn’t
wish to kick a Melbourne city councillor when
he’s down, or trample on a prostrate Mayor’s
feelings, still less does a respectable journal
desire to inflict pain upon a churchwarden.
Therefore we will merely observe that Geddks*
with heaps of luck to assist him and every
possible inducement to remain honest, was a
humbug who has once again proved that it is
easier for a camel to enter the Kingdom of
Heaven than for an “influential citizen” to get
his deserts.

Mr, Hyndman, the English Socialist, casts a
side-light on the advantages of labour :
No industry which was carried on under conditions
which meant degradation to those who produced that in-
dustry was profitable. At the present moment health
was being sapped in every way and in every trade.
Physiologists said that eight hours’ hard work a day was
too much. A horse could not be worked more than three
or four hours a day. The effect of overwork was that the
working-classes died at just half the age of those who
lived upon labour—namely, at 27 instead of 55. During
periods of strike or distress the death-rate actually fell
below what was normal, although the workpeople were
exposed to semi-starvation ; and it was the majority who
at the present time were being slave-driven and injured
for the benefit of a comparative few. If that was so the
Legislature w'as bound to interfere. In every industry in
the country the power of each workman to produce wealth
had been multiplied a hundredfold in the last 50 years.
Why was it that the workers alone should reap no benefits
from the change ?
It is a pity that the world cannot call together
a congress of its hoary veterans in order to
verify this statement. Queen Victoria would
be there collecting her salary with her accus-
tomed vigour at the ripe age of 72, and along
with her Field-Marshal Gamp, as healthy and
vigorous as when he fled in consternation from
the Alma nearly 40 years ago. One of Nelson’s
old friends is still successfully drawing his pen-
sion as an Admiral on the verge of his 100th
birthday, and his presence would compensate in
some measure for the loss of Gamp’s mother
who was prematurely cut off at the age of 92.
William, the intoxicated and unwashed King
of Holland, would shine at the gathering and
prove conclusively that when a man has no
work to do he can bear up against nearly 9(»
years of dirt and beer ; and the House of Lords
could send along a noble contingent of octo-
genarian peers, and successfully explain the
absence of many more who married shady
actresses in their old age and were prematurely
jawed to death in consequence. And Parkes
could attend to testify that politics are more
healthy than the button-making industry, and
Robertson could endorse his statement in the
beautifully choice language for which he is
famous. And, as for the men of toil, the bulk of
them are mostly pretty old at 45, and rheumatic
and venerable at 50, and at 60 they are only a
memory and a tombstone, for which reasons
they would probably be unable to attend.
Apropos of certain N.S.W. Parliamentary
occurrences last week, we may remark that very
rarely indeed are corrupt overtures made to a
reputedly virtuous politician, any more than
they are to a reputedly virtuous woman. There
are exceptions to every rule, but, broadly and
figuratively speaking, the member who is
approached with a bribe has sealskin on his
back, rouge on his lips, and dye on his hair, and
is dawdling late at night under a gas-lamp on
the political side-walk. What a wealth of un-
conscious humour there was in the naive admis-
sion made not long since by a N.S.W. member
of Parliament: “I hadn’t been in the House
six weeks, Mr. Speaker, before I had a dozen
bribes offered me.” The wise man who does
happen to be offered a bribe never says any-
thing about it—any more than the wise woman
whose virtue is affronted ever seeks to publish
the circumstance to the world.
The N.S.W. Art Society’s Dinner.
The New South Wales Art Society’s annual
banquet, which is justly regarded as being of
an exalted description amongst the effete social'
“ functions ” of our day and generation, was even
better this year than ever. It was less pre-
Raphaelite and officially ornate, and rather more
impressionist in its character. Parkes wasn’t
there, nor Governor 0., nor Alfred Bennett, nor
several other people whose possession of metal
decorations and yawns of more or less aristocratic
chasmality make them the envy of the dazzled
throng. Then there was an air of chastened
wisdom in the ministerial arrangements. Dan the
Jaynil, the resplendent postage-stamp of public
life, was present in a dual capacity. He repre-
sented not alone several moral aspects of Free-
trade ; he blossomed over the festive chalice of
literature and the fine arts as the friend of Phidias
and the member from Greece. And the M ‘Million
was there to illuminate with the electric rays of
his wholesale-warehouse intelligence all those
moral aspects of Ereetrade and all those scintillat-
ing facets of ancient Hellas which were too insig-
nificant for the mighty brain of the O'Connor to
sweep into the waste-bin of ministerial culture.
* * #
The speeches were decidedly better, though few
were so well-prepared as the turkey that groaned
•m the artistic palette. Then there was an inno-
vation of a cultivated and refined and high-toned
character—an innovation which was only an inno-
vation to the barbarous natives who chop out their
artistic sensibilities from iron-bark back-logs, and
whose notions of chiaroscuro are fashioned from
beef-wood shingles and undressed garden palings.
for the innovation put on the guise of an angel of
light and came down to us in a dress-suit from the
days of King Lud, and his “function” was to
issue proclamations from behind the President’s
chair touching the healths of various people whom
it was thought proper to swallow in a liquid form.
Ah ! it was a touching sight, but the occasion was
deprived of considerable of its impressive awe-
someness inasmuch as the Toast-master-hereto
alleged—had forgotten his trumpet and his armo-
rial quarterlies and looked no more imposing than
a fish-waiter in an oyster-saloon; moreover, his
voice suggested early prawns, and he had his hair
oiled. Nevertheless, he is a long-felt want, and
he marks a distinct advance in artistic culture in
this land; likewise, it is so,English, you know,
deah boy !
# * #
The artists drank the Queen and the Queen’s
colonial effigy with that frigid respect and suppressed
emotional calm which seems so perfectly to suit
toasts of this kind, and then the president of the
Art Society erected himself and made several
patronising allusions to the Ministry. This
attack brought the M‘Million to his feet,
and, passing his hand wearily over his brow, he
proceeded to unwind all he had heard and read
about art in the newspapers and otherwhere,
and to pretend to know something definite
and conclusive in the matter. But he finally
gave it up as more hopeless than the
Chinese cause in New South Wales, and
more confusing than the complications of a
budget. In spite of his efforts, printed calicoes
and painted canvases would get confusedly mixed,
and after having, in defiance of some anticipated
contradiction, courageously asserted that art was
art, he sat down with a mixed-15oking bump of
perception and a relieved appearance, and simply
devoted himself to smiling at Daniel bearding the
lions in their native den.
* * *
Now, if there is any sight on earth more im-
pressive than the Laokoon or the lions in
Trafalgar Square, it is the Jaynial speaking to
the toast of “the ladies,” or unfolding the mas-
sive creases of his brain on a question ■ like art,
assisted by side-lights from Lempriere’s classical
dictionary and the reminiscential exhortations of
Sheridan Moore. Dan’s erudition is abysmal,
but it is tilled with flowers. It is like a fantasti-
cally-decorated void of Hibernian nothingness,
rich with the spoils of time, more diaphanous than
a shadow, more unreal thah a dream, situated on a
chaos of snowy beard in the midst of an ocean of
brogue. Dan dragged Phidias and Praxiteles and
Epaminondas and Raphael and Titian from their
little beds in the quiet of the centuries, and then,
with the calmest insouciance, he piled on top of
their classic and mediaeval frames the carcases of
Michael Angelo and Leonardo da Yinci and
Rubens, and laid the whole osseous trophy at the
artistic feet of President Ashton.
Charles Keene will never again draw for
Punch, his health having completely broken
down.
Sara Gillott, the Melbourne Attorney, is

Building Society case.
Lord Carington will attend some thirty or
forty banquets ere leaving for England. He is

The first Lord St. Leonards’ place, Boyle

The fact that the non-productive Barrier
mines are shut down as well as those which
required coal proves that the mine-owners, joyfully
seized the lamest of pretexts to aim a blow at
associated labor.
The t-ydney Daily Telegraph’s comps.,

cal Association, forwarded a second subscription

strike. ”
“An attempt is being made by Messrs.
Devitt and Moore, at the instigation of Lord
Brassey, to make the mercantile marine popular
among the better classes. Two ships belonging
to the firm have just sailed from the Thames for
Melbourne, carrying between them 48 midship-
men, or pupils, for whom are provided instructors
and special accommodation. The fees are gradu-
ated, £7O for the voyage out and home, which
is the hightest amount, being paid by greenhorns,
and a less sum charged to those with some ex-
perience.”—Ex.
Mr. John Hickson, of Cambridge (Tas.),
hung himself in a temporary way a few days ago
because ho wanted to find out how long a man
could hang without losing his breath. He meant
to climb down again when his thirst for know-
ledge was satisfied, but something went wrong
with the arrangements, and he stayed where he
was. When he was found, two hours later, he
was still up in the air and investigating the point.
Verdict: Died through looking for unnecessary
information.
Dear Bulletin, —A costly little game,
which sadly needs exposure, is being carried on
by certain sharp Sydney attorneys. When a
Sydney merchant has a number of small out-
standing accounts due to him —under £lo—he
employs an attorney to x-ecover, with the stipula-
tion that all costs are to be paid by the debtor.
The attorney, knowing that no solicitor's fee is
allowed either in the Petty Sessions or District
Court for cases under £lO, issues a Supreme Court
writ, which document exhorts the defendant to pay
the debt —say £'S~ and £llls. fid. for costs (besides
mileage) within eight days, otherwise judgment,
with more costs. Very often the defendant is
frightened and pays up the debt and costs. But
unless he is ignorant and foolish he will do no
such thing. Let him enter appearance, which he
can do personally, and then await developments.
The sharp attorney will probably not proceed
further, knowing that £2 will bave to be paid into
court to set down the case for trial before a jury,
and knowing also that, even if successful, he
cannot get costs, unless the Judge certifies that
there was reasonable cause for bringing the case
in the Supreme Court, which his Honor will cer-
tainly not do. If, then, the plaintiff’s attorney
does not file his declaration within the time
limited by the Court Rules, the defendant comes
with a rush and the fun begins. He had better
now employ an attorney, with the stipulation
that all costs are to come out of the sueing practi-
tioner. His attorney will at once sign judgment
against the plaintiff of now pros, and tax his bill
of costs, which will come to over £5: and as
plaintiff’s attorney cannot allow his client to be
levied on for the amount, he will promptly pay
the costs out of his own pocket. The above course
was lately adopted by a defendant with much
success, and as no joy can equal that of making a
very “smart” attorney pay his own client’s costs,
we advise all defendants similarly situated to
follow the blessed example above quoted.—Yours,
Through the Mill.

Viewed through the medium of anticipa-
tions raised by previous Shakesperian revivals at
Her Majesty’s, “ Macbeth ” cannot be pronounced
an unqualified success. Unadorned by the spec-
tacular grandeur that fitly surrounded “Julius
Osesar,” some of its supernaturalisms—admirably
suited to the pantomimicry of “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream ” are out of place in this sternly
tragic story. Stage realism up to a certain point
is necessary for dramatic effect; that overstepped,
it destroys the suggestiveness that permeates the
truly artistic in all things. Eor instance, the
ludicrous bobbing-up of Banquo’s head in the
banquet-scene simply kills the impressiveness of
Macbeth’s distracted utterances. If the visions
apparent only to a fevered brain are to be thus
materialised, a dagger might fitly be dangled from
the flies and plucked upward when the moody
Thane says “Oome, let me clutch thee.” The
audience should be driven by the intensity of the
actor’s art to see through his eyes, to feel the
verity of all that he professes to see. Lacking
that intensity, the appearance of fifty gory heads
will only excite ridicule. So far, the Macbeth of
George Rignold has, for the most part, felt his
way through his lines and acted like one whose
mind was pre-occupied. Cognisant of the fact,
and combating it, he at intervals electrifies his
audience with a stirring reading, and will in time
doubtless get rid of this heaviness ; nevertheless, it
is unlikely that “Macbeth” will ever be deemed
one of his strong parts. The Lady Macbeth
of Janet Achurch—somewhat “dolly ” in make-
up—is. an olla podrida, a dish of various in-
gredients in which a satisfying and full-flavoured
morsel is only occasionally encountered. In fact,
she seems to have thoroughly studied only two or
three speeches, and, therefore, her performance
suggests a dramatic recital, not a coherent imper-
sonation. Charles Charrington’s finnikin utter-
ance is not suitable for the delivery of blank verse,
and he has not half the physical and vocal force
necessary for the impersonation of Macduff. In
the combat he should have died a thousand deaths,
and, as a gentleman remarked from the gallery,
the fight was too evidently “ a put-up job.”
The much-cut-down Malcolm of Herbert Flem-
ming is a pink and pretty creature for whose mis-
fortunes no one in front evinces much sympathy,
and stage-manager Hazlitt, careful and intelligent
though he be, is not particularly well-placed as
Banquo. In Harry Jewett’s hands Duncan’s
elocution is admirable, but the monarch has no
“ proper pride,” and is not half so haughty as a
suburban mayor. Governor and Lady Carington,
accompanied by the Countess of Hopetoun, will
attend on Saturday evening.

None of the Sydney papers have expressed
a straight-forward opinion as to the respective
merits of the two Boccaccios. Our vote has been
secured by Nellie Stewart’s, which is as exhilara-
ting as sparkling wine. But tastes differ : years
ago a satisfying, full-bodied beverage named
Marian's Burton Ale was Very popular in Aus-
tralia. It was too heavy for our palate, but, Lord
bless you, lots of people swore by it. Hnazelle’s
Lambertuccio has been broadened and developed
since first night, until, in the second act at all
events, it is a very good low comedy performance.
By the way, what a Baillie Nicol Jarvie little
Johnny Gourlay would make. He and the
kittenish Kelton are prime favourites with the
populace. Bessie Major is getting lots of fun out
of Beronella in the scenes with Knight Aston as
Leonetto. On Monday last “ our Nellie ” was
hoarse as a raven, but the dashing Burton was
rusticating, and so she had to scrape through.
Houses are not up to the “ Paul Jones ” average.

Even when aided by “Barbara,” the pretty little
play in which Mrs. Brough first thoroughly thawed
herself, “ A Fool’s Paradise,” although patronised

crib from Dr. Tholosseh in “Nos Intimes”) has
proved the failure of B. and B.’s Criterion produc-
tions. It will be fired out on Saturday in favour
of “Dandy Dick,” a farcical comedy, said to be
the funniest thing Pinero ever penned, in which
George Anson, as a parson, has the fattest part of
his life. The company now in possession will be
further strengthened by the inclusion of James
Cathcart, E. C. Corlesse, Annie Taylor, and
Florence Harcourt, who has not, we imagine, and
it is a curious coincidence, played in Sydney since
.she appeared in “Dick” during the “Cri.” bur
lesque season. That Dick was a budding Mayor ;
this is a racehorse. Lord and Lady Carington
and the Countess of Hopetoun have engaged seats
for Monday night.

With a change of bill, the engagement of
Tracy and Adson—two clever song-and-dance
men—and Daisy Blair, Harry Rickards again
finds Sydney School of Arts too small at times for
his audiences. Harry has several new songs, in-
cluding Godfrey’s clever sketch, “The Road to
Ruin,” and “Break It Gently,” a truly comic
song; and the versatile Fred. Davys and Georgie
Devoe have also worked up some new specialities.
The opening item now is “ In a Fog.”
There’s heaps of room in Sydney Center
nial Hall for the afternoon Orchestral Concert
audiences, when, contrary to the usual practice,
folks get as far from the platform as possible.
The novelty last Saturday was Grieg’s “Peer
Gynt,” of which the last movement—a martial,
barbaric, and weird strain—was encored and re-
peated. The Nofcturno and Scherzo of Mendels-
sohn’s music to “Midsummer Nights Dream,
familiarised in Sydney by the late Rignoldian
production, between which and Raff’s “Dance of
the Dryads” played later, there is a family resem-
blance, were highly appreciated. The exquisite
“ Berenice” was repeated by special request, and
the Scherzo of Sylvia was encored as usual.

“ School,” that attractive, delusive narra-
tive of love in a ladies’ seminary, started its first
Melbourne term on Saturday by filling the Bijou
with more money (stated manager Mayne) than
the theatre, now or old, had ever before netted at
one haul. Robertson’s comedy, built as it is upon
a, foundation of fresh, giddy girlhood, and em-
bodying the possible result of two Romeos being
permitted to prowl at large amongst a shrubbery
full of sentimental virgins, and waft kisses over
the garden wall, appeals to the tenderest emotions
of either sex. (lazing upon this picture of vestal
frolic the audience must fain let their imaginations
run riot. When Mrs. Sutcliffe orders her mob of
spring chickens off to roost, one relapses
into a languorous dream of golden tresses,
rumpled pillows, hairpins, and curl- papers.
The thought of those girls’ dormitories, whose
chaste darkness is filled with the sighs of virgin
innocence and the murmurs of muffled giggles
gently stealing from underneath sheets scarce
whiter than the forms they enfold —the thought
of all this causes old men to break out into a
warm glow, and the eyes of stern matrons to
sparkle anew with’ the light of other days. As for
the young men and women present, the effect
upon their feelings is beyond the power of mortal
pen to tell. Although much of the moralising
and repartee of the first act is out of date.
“School” has an enduring charm, inasmuch as
love can never grow old, and the Sydney success
of B. and B.’s production is likely to be equalled
in Melbourne.

One or two notable changes from the pre-
vious oast have been made. Boucicault stamps
Beau Earintosh as the feature of the show, being
a happy reminder, as
regards both make-up
and manner, of Hare
in the original charac-
ter. Uneasy and rather
artificial in Saturday’s
opening scene, Mr. B.
developed senility,
humour, and pathos as
the play proceeded, and
finished with an artistic
realisation of the shat-
tered dandy. Lawrence
over-acts Krux, giving
that malevolent usher an
unnecessary curve in the
spine and other Quilpish
attributes, but Miss
Romer, the present ex-
ponent of Mrs. Sutcliffe,
fills her billet to the
life. Pattie Brown,
Emma Temple, Tither-
adge, Lash Gordon, and
Percy Lyndal resume the
positions they held in
Sydney, and the comedy
is beautifully staged as
heretofore.

At the Royal there
was a change, too, on
Saturday night, “Potter
of Texas” being with-
drawn, after a drivelling
career of one weary week,
in favour of “The Mys-

George Darrell’s drama-
tisation of that over-rated

shows early symptoms of
ability every here and
there, enjoy opportunities
for firing off a revolver
or a blunderbuss just as
the curtain is descending,
and it is even possible
to drop into the theatre

appear in his own Irish drama bearing the ap-
petising title of “Famine.”

“Alone in London” has been going so
well at the Alexandra that it may last over another
week. The violence of Albert Norman’s sneer and
the comparative maturity of Nan’s seven-year-old
offspring are the only blots upon an otherwise first-
class rendering of a good drama. Charley and his
faithful Liz deserve the special word of praise
they didn’t receive last w r eek, while the accuracy
with which the venerable Jenkinson slips down-
stairs is more remarkable than ever, and covers
up such a multitude of sins that the old villain s
popularity with the gallery-bcys can be under-
stood, if not excused. In ability to break all the
Commandments at once, without losing the love of
his fellow creatures, Bland Holt stands alone on
one leg, like a pelican in the wilderness.

“Fun on the Bristol” is alleged to be still
booming at the Opera House, but the show has a
worn and jaded appearance altogether. Matters
progress much as usual at the Gaiety and Victoria
Halls, and the St. George’s Palace of Wonders,
which opened on Saturday, seems to he running
on the same line as wonders usually run. Captain
Jorgensen expounds the mysteries of his Storm
King lifeboat to enquiring minds at the Wax-
works, and the Cyclorama continues to drive a
steady trade in Waterloo, where old Teremiah
Brown is still on tap.

Mrs. Potter and Bellew have come to their
positive last appearances at Melbourne Princess’s,
and a non-productive season is dying hard.
Monday night saw the finish of “Hero and
Leander ” which was to be withdrawn—more’s
the pity I—that Mrs. Potter might take her leave
in “Camille,” the part best suited to her strange
mannerisms. Then the slender enthusiast will
paok-up Worth’s millinery and journey to
Adelaide, or somewhere, taking Bellew with her.
On Saturday the old comic opera crowd, recruited
by baritone Ryley, come back to the scene of their
former triumphs, &e. The ecldt attaching to a
new opera will be badly wanting, however. They
start with “ Dorothy,” to be followed by other
chestnuts previous to the production of “The
Gondoliers.”

The exHiusband of a certain smart little
actress states that the late Phil. Beck, “being
annoyed at something that had taken place,”
admitted to the husband that he had been too
giddy with the lady aforesaid. Phil. Beck was
ever a worm of a Lothario. In London—before
coming to Australia the first time—he had been
theatrical guide, philosopher, friend and leading
actor to a deluded manageress who dropped
countless thousands by her venture. When all
her capital was exhausted Phil, packed up his
portmanteau and left his patroness to pine alone.
The fellow had no conscience, and no anything to
recommend him beyond a faculty for photograph-
ing words upon a diseased brain, and two ugly
furrows in his fat cheeks which passed for dimples
behind the footlights.

Fortune Hunting.
It is a difficult thing in these days of speculation
and peculation, of combinations and trusts, for a
man to acquire a fortune in any of the usual avoca
tion, if he follows the lines of strict integrity. But
it can be done. What has been done can be.
There are men now living enjoying large fortunes
which were acquired honestly—strictly so—they
enjoy the results of sagacity, tenacity, and hard
work. The time has passed when men can hope
to play at business and get on ; competition is too
great. Fortunes are sometimes acquired by chance,
they are usually lost the same way. Experience
teaches that the old saying is a true one, “Easy
comes, easy goes.” The fortunes that are held
and increased are almost always the result of close
application to business. The millionaires are,
as a class, the hardest-worked men in the
country. One of the most important ele-
ments of success in almost any walk of life
in this country is good health. It requires a
robust grappling with the chances to wrest success
from the thousand competitors for the same prize
—nine hundred and ninety-nine of whom must
fail. This is why the country lads so frequently
outstrip their city-bred competitors in the race for
commercial success, though the natural chances
would seem to be strongly in favour of the latter.
The man who is able to attend to his business
every d-ay in the year necessarily has an advantage
over the man who has to lay off a week or so
every now and then because of ill-health. It can-
not be too strongly impressed on our minds that
ill-health is most generally the result of neglect.
Health is our normal condition. If the main
purifying organs, the liver and kidneys, are kept
in healthy action, or if deranged, are put in such
condition, the danger of being stricken down
with sudden disease is very slight. Good health
is a prize not duly appreciated until lost. Ill-
health is a great misfortune—you cannot afford to
take chances on it. Keep your system right.
“ It is a fact that many of the best proprietary
medicines of the day,” said the late Dr. .1. G.
Holland, in Scribner’s Magazine, “ are more
successful than many physicians, and most of
them were first discovered or used in actual
medical practice. When, however, any shrewd
person, knowing their virtue and foreseeing their
popularity, secures and advertises them, in the
opinion of the bigoted all virtue went out of
them.” Failure of eyesight, fickle appetite, head-
ache, extreme wakefulness, frequent desire to
urinate, especially at night, gradual failure of
strength and dropsical swelling—these are symp-
toms of kidney disease. If you neglect the symp-
toms you will eventually have Bright’s Disease.
Warner’s safe cure is the only specific which has
ever been discovered for this disease. The late
Dr. Dio Lewis, over his own signature, said : “If
I found myself the victim of a serious kidney
trouble I would use Warner’s safe cure.”

The Stolen Colours.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
An exclusively male society, such as ours was on
the Baroma River, is apt to get along very
smoothly for years, provided that all of the indi-
viduals composing it are fairly companionable.
There were five stations on the Baroma, all cattle-
stations. Sheep had been tried on the country,
but without success, and now the only marks of
their former presence were some roofless huts and
the bare patches of ground where once stood sheep-
yards ; for it was before the days of fences and
boundary-riders. Three of the stations were
managed by their owners; the other two belonged
to Sydney and Melbourne firms, and were in the
charge of superintendents, of whom I was one.
Markwell, the other superintendent, was per-
haps the only man who did not quite fit in to our
little coterie. There was no gainsaying his smart-
ness and ability, but he had a bad temper, and an
evil habit of sneering.
Elliot, the owner of Bendalla, the largest station
on the river, was a widower. He had one son,
who lived on the station with him, and two daugh-
ters, who at the time of my story had just arrived
’ on a protracted visit, and created quite an upset
in the hitherto even tenor of our way.
Hayward, who owned Pixie, the next station
to the one I was managing, was a professed
woman-hater, and affected to look on the
interest displayed in the new-comers Avith
lofty scorn. Kelly, who had the station on
the opposite side of the river, called after that
stream, Baroma Plains, fell head over ears in love,
straight away Avith Mary Elliot, the elder girl,
and having successfully persuaded that young lady
that she was in as hopeless a condition, in less
than three months their engagement was a pro-
claimed fact.
Agnes Elliot was two years younger than her
engaged sister, and of a very different character.
Both were handsome girls, but Mary was easy-
going and good-tempered to a fault, while Agnes,
was of a more active and passionate nature. A
tale of wrong that would win from Mary a feAV
compassionate remarks, Avould wring hot indigna-
tion from Agnes.
Jack Elliot, their
brother, had always been
my especial mate on the
river, and naturally on
the arrival of his sisters
I was thrown a good deal
into their society ; nor
was it long before I
learned to love the bright
and eager Agnes with a
love that could never
have been inspired in
me by her placid sister.
I kept my secret, as I
thought, very well, for I
had no more prospect
of marrying on the ex-
tremely limited screw of
a cattle-station super,
than I had of being
made Governor. I might
even have got over the
tit altogether and cured
myself by enforced ab-
sence, but for the rivalry
of Markwell.
He was my senior by
some four or five years,
had travelled more, and
had far more social quali-
ties, when he choose to
exert them, than I had; but no better worldly
position to recommend him, and knowing the
real nature of the man I felt that to suffer him
to win such a girl as Agnes Elliot would be a
downright wrong to her.
That, you may say, is always the way in which
the jealous man argues. Men do not love women
so deeply as they hate their rivals in the affections
of those women. Marriage is more often the re-
sult of a man’s determination to avoid injury to
his own armour-propre than of anything else.
Kelly and Mary Elliot were duly married,
Baroma Plains rejoiced in a new house and other
embellishments, and I was still uncertain as to
whether the wayward heart of Agnes inclined to
me or not. She had come over to stay with her
sister for a while, and one evening I rode across
the river ostensibly to see Kelly on some station-
business. That was one of the evenings that has
ever dwelt in my memory. Never had Agnes been
so kind to me. Kelly and his bride, with whom I
was first favourite, left us much to ourselves, and
half-a-dozen times an avowal of my love was on
my lips. How different things might have been
had 1 spoken then !
She came on to the verandah to say “ Good
Night!” to me when I left. For a moment I
lingered with her warm hand in mine, and her
bright eyes looking at me from the dusky shadow
of the verandah ; then, with sudden desperation, I
pressed her hands to my lips and, with a broken
“Good Night!” hurried to my horse, mounted,
and rode away. She was still standing in the
doorway as I turned for a last look, and waved
her hand in reply to my salute; and I rode home,
the happiest man on the river.
When I entered my small sitting-room I saw
that, during my absence, the mail had arrived,
for the station-bag was lying on the table. I
opened it without much interest in the contents,
for I was quite absorbed in a dream of Agnes,
but was rather surprised to find among the
ordinary correspondence a letter from my only
brother in England, with whom I had not corres-
ponded for years—not from any quarrel, but sim-
ply through the disinclination to write that grows
on most men in the bush. The letter had been
delayed through going to a former address. The
contents were important, as they notified to me
the death of an uncle, who had left his money to
ray brother and myself and two cousins.
My first thought naturally was that now I was
in a position to propose to Agnes, and I lay awake
all night, determined that not many hours of day-
light should elapse ere I was over at Baroma
Plains,
The next morning the delays seemed never-
ending. Horses had escaped from the paddock,
a black boy got bucked off and broke his collar-
bone, which I had to set, and a messenger came
over from Hayward with a letter requiring a reply.
It was IX o’clock ere I was once more in sight of
the verandah where I had last seen Agnes.
Mrs. Kelly met me with her usual kind smile.
Agnes had gone home nearly an hour ago. J ack
Elliott had come up for her in a hurry, as his
father was starting down to port and wanted
Agnes to go down with him. I hesitated whether
to go on to Bendalla on the chance of overtaking
them, but my presence was absolutely necessary
on the station : I could not leave without going
back first.
“When will they be back ?” I asked, blushing,
as I thought that my fair hostess was
reading me like a book.
“ They will stop until the races. You know we
are all going down, and you must come with us.”
The local races were coming off in about a week
at the little shipping port; and most of us on the
river had entered horses for the occasion. I
thanked Mrs. Kelly for her invitation, which I
gladly accepted, and, without telling my news,
rode home.
Only a week! but it loomed before me like a
year. I could not even write, for we had only a
weekly mail, and I would be down myself by that
time. To add to my annoyance, Markwell, whose
place was at the head of the river, came over that
night, on his way down to port. I managed to be
civil to him, but when I saw him ride away in the
morning to the township, where he would be
within call of Agnes for the whole week during
which I should be tied to the station, I felt in-
clined to try on him the range of my new rifle.
Hayward came to see me next day, and to him I
confided the news of my inheritance. He had
been talking of going out west and taking-up
some country for which, at that time, there was a
great rush, and he urged me to accompany him
now that I had the means. He was a shrewd man,
for whom I had a great liking, and I promised to
weigh the matter carefully.
At last the time came when I could fling dull
care aside, and, seated on the boxbes.de Kelly,
relieving him occasionally of the task of tooling
four horses along an abominable road, I felt that
every mile brought me nearer to the consumma-
tion of my hopes. Arrived in the little port which
in those days had not assumed its present dimen-
sions or importance, my first thought, after I had
made myself presentable, was naturally to call
upon Mr. Elliot. The family, including Kelly and
his wife, were located in the house of a friend, a
widower, with one little girl, whose habitation
was far too big for him. Agnes was out —gone

and said, “You don’t know

out for a ride with her brother and Markwell.
This was a check at the start.
While chatting with Elliot the party returned,
and, with a very sore feeling in my heart, the
meeting I had been so longing for came off.
How bright and handsome she looked in her
close-fitting riding-habit as she came along the
verandah and greeted me ! Every jealous thought
in my mind would have been exorcised but for
the presence of Markwell, who gs,ve me a super-
cilious nod and looked on with an air of insolent
proprietorship—at least I thought so—while the
ordinary commonplace words were exchanged.
She noticed instinctively the change in my manner
and her pride took fire. Ah ! these wretched con-
ceits of self, which do work we can never undo !
I stayed to dinner with the Elliots, but had no
opportunity to speak to Agnes until some time
afterwards, when by chance I saw her sitting
apart from the others in the drawing-room with
the little girl, the daughter of their host, at her
knee. She was stitching industriously at some
ribbon and I lost not a minute in reaching her
side.
“ What is the work, Miss Elliot ?” I said rather
awkwardly to break the ice.
“My colours for to-morrow’s races,” she re-
turned.
“ And who is to wear them?” I asked, bending
down and speaking earnestly.
“That depends,” she answered, glancing up at
me with a smile that put every sore feeling to
flight, for I knew they were meant for me.
“So we have to congratulate you, Murray,”
said the hateful voice of Markwell close behind.
I turned sharply round, and Agnes flushed
quickly, for his words seemed to have a double
meaning.
“ What do you mean?” I asked, rather rudely.
“ Why, they say you have come in to a pot of
money. Is it true ?”
(|So some gabbling idiot from the station had
brought the yarn down and now it was blurted out
like this when I had meant to tell Agnes just when
I asked her to be my wife! I replied very shortly
that an uncle of mine was dead from whom I in-
herited some money, but my chance was spoilt,
and if it had been my rival’s object to break up
our chat, lie succeeded admirably. I guessed that
Agnes was hurt that I had not told her brother or
father, who had so long been my friends, of my
good fortune, not divining my reason for keeping
silence.
Next morning the whole township was on the
racecourse. I rode out the two miles with Jack
Elliot, for Kelly had his trap full. I wondered
whether Agnes had entrusted the knot of ribbons
to her brother, but apparently he was charged
with no such mission, so I took the earliest oppor-
tunity of presenting myself before the party as
soon as I saw them arrive. I had promised to
steer a horse of Kelly’s in the Hurdle Race, for, as
a newly-married man, all such pleasures had been
sternly denied him, and Markwell, who was a
sporting man, had entered a horse of his own.
It was in vain that I lingered around the buggy.
Agnes several times seemed on the point of speak-
ing to me confidentially, but something always
interfered, and I had at last to go away unsatisfied
as the time for our race was approaching.
I had donned my jacket, or rather Kelly’s, when
the man himself came into the tent.
“Now, then, Davie,” he said, “ just one word.
I want to win this race, and you can do it if you
race Markwell right away from the, jump. The
others have no show; his horse has more foot than
Beeswax (Kelly’s horse), but he can’t fly his junjps
like old Bee can, and if you make it hot from the
start, he’ll either come to grief or drive you home.”
' I signified my comprehension, and was leaving
the tent when he added : “By the way, Mary gave
me a message for you from Agnes—something
about having lost something; however, she can
tell you herself after you’ve won the race;” and so
we sallied forth, I much puzzled at the meaning of
the half-forgotten message.
Markwell was already mounted and had taken
his horse over a hurdle, and was walking him
back when I passed him, and there, on the breast
of his jacket, was the identical knot of black-and-
orange ribbons I had seen Agnes putting together
the night before.
The sight roused every jealous passion within
me ; I knew they must be the same, or else why
had I not received them according to the half
promise made ?
“ I’ll win this race or break Markwell’s neck,” I
muttered to Kelly as he gave me a leg into the
saddle. He squeezed my hand, and the next
moment Beeswax was over the hurdle like a
swallow.
There were six of us in the race, but Markwell’s
horse was the only one I dreaded. We had a
good start although Beeswax, excited by his canter,
was dancing to get off. I took ttie lead at once at
a pace that few hurdle races are ever ridden, and
for half a mile kept it, without seeing a horse,
Beeswax taking his jumps just as a matter of
course. At the end of the half-mile I heard a rap
and a clatter, and glancing round found Markwell
just behind me.
His horse had twice the pace of Beeswax and he
had bustled him over the jumps so far without
coming to grief. On the flat he raced up to me
without an effort and I knew that my only chance
was to rush him at the hurdles. Twice his horse
blundered dreadfully, and I was well ahead when
we were two jumps from home. If he got over
those two jumps safely I was beaten for he would
catch me on the straight run in.
I knew Markwell’s horse was as excitable as he
could be, so I pulled Beeswax a little and let him
come up and get about half a length ahead, then
I put Beeswax at the next jump “alll kneW,”and
he seemed to take the hurdle in his stride. Not so
my rival’s mount; maddened with the rush of
the other horse alongside of him, he scarcely
attempted to jump and went down headlong, but
fortunately for his rider, sending him rolling
ahead.
The others were all out of it, so I pulled Bees-
wax in ; put him quietly over the last hurdle and
cantered past the winning-post.
“ He’s all right,” said Kelly, as he came and
took my bridle to lead me in to be weighed, “ but
he got a devil of a purler.”
Strange to say, Markwell had escaped almost
without a bruise. He had been flung forward, a
little to one side, just as the horse was in the act
of turning over, and had rolled out of harm’s way.
The saddle was smashed, and the horse could never
be got to face a jump again, but I was really glad
that no worse accident had happened.
He came up pluckily, in spite of his shaking,
and forced a jesting remark about the pace we
had ridden. I changed my jacket, and after the
usual noisy congratulations, found my way up to
Mrs. Kelly and Agnes.
“Your colours were unlucky, Miss Elliot,” I
said, regretting the words the next moment.
“My colours, Mr. Murray! I did not know
they were in the race.”
“Mr. Markwell wore them, at any rate,” I
answered, rather surprised.
“You are joking,” she replied; “and I don’t
think it in good taste.”
I f I drew back, snubbed and offended. Mrs. Kelly
put her hand on my shoulder as I stood beside the
buggy, and, stooping down, whispered to me,
quite energetically for her,
“ Davie, don’t be a fool.”
I guessed her meaning, and if I could have made
my peace then, I would ; but I was not afforded
the opportunity. Agnes kept me at a distance for
the rest of the day.
There was a race-ball that night, and I fondly
hoped that I should have a chance of an explana-
tion. Markwell, in spite of the heavy fall he had
experienced, was there, and exerting all the agree-
able qualities he possessed to the utmost.
Agnes gave me no excuse for trying to get a
moment’s private conversation, and in the course
of the evening I was lounging in a sulky fit on the
verandah, when I saw her and Markwell in deep
conversation in a secluded part of it. She was
speaking earnestly, although I could not see the
expression of her face. I had seen enough, how-
ever, for my then temper; apparently she had
afforded him the benefit of the confidential interview
that she had avoided giving me. I left the ball,
and a month afterwards Hayward and I were out
west. I stayed out there two years, I heard from
Kelly and J ack Elliot, but the name of Agnes
seemed carefully tabooed in their letters.
One evening I received a visit from an old
friend who had a station not very far from the
little port where my love-dream had been shat-
tered. He had taken up country beyond Hayward
and me, and was on his road to port when he
called.
“By the way,” he said, “you may remember
Markwell who got such a spill at the races that
time ; but, of course, you do, as you rode against
him.”
I nodded assent, and he went on.
“ I heard he had come out this way to take up
country for his firm.”
“ He didn’t marry Miss Elliot, then ?” I said in
as easy a voice as I could command.
“I should think not,” replied my friend, “she
found him out in a most shabby trick. I’ll tell
you all about it. You remember the ball after
the races ? I was out on the verandah behind a
screen of plants and flags doing a quiet flirtation,
when Miss Elliot and Markwell came on the other
side. We couldn’t well get out and had to sit
there and listen to what they were saying. It
seems he had bribed the little girl at the house
where the Elliots were staying to steal a knot of
ribbon that Miss Elliot had made for somebody
else and he had worn it openly at the races as
though she had given it to him. That young lady
could be very indignant when she lilted, and I
shouldn’t have liked the sarcasm she lashed Mark-
well with.”
I was silent for some time, while Russel smoked
vigorously, recalling the scene.
“ I’m tired of this place,” I suddenly said ; “ I’ll
go down to port with you.”
“That’s famous,” he returned, “I wanted a
mate down.” And he turned in while I com-
menced my preparations.
Half-way across what was known as “ the dry-
stage,” was a shanty, professedly an accommoda-
tion house; but, of course, a sly-grog shop. The
man who kept it met us outside the rude thatched
verandah and said he was glad we had come as
there was a man inside who had “ a touch of the
sun ” and he was afraid he was going to die.
We went in to see the poor fellow, and there, on
the frowsy bunk, lay my old rival, Markwell. The
man said he arrived the day before, on foot, his
horse had fallen with him and got away, and he
had walked on to borrow another to go after him.
He was light-headed and had been so ever since.
Russel and I sat up all night doing what we
could, but it was useless; the poor fellow died
before morning. Once he recognised me and
laughed wildly, “You didn’t get Agnes after all,
Murray,” he said, then he relapsed into mad talk
about racing.
It was a lovely evening when, with my heart in
my mouth, I rode up to Baroma Plains, for I pre-
ferred to see Mrs. Kelly first. She and her hus-
band were standing on the verandah watching me
curiously as I came up. Suddenly Kelly gave a
wild whoop and sprang off the verandah. “It’s
Davie by gum!” he exclaimed, and I was soon
standing between them.
I looked hard at Mrs. Kelly, hoping she would
take pity on me, but I had to ask the question
after all.
“Agnes?”
Kelly pursed up his lips, “Don’t you know?”
he asked.
“Know what?” I demanded, swallowing a big
lump in my throat.
“Why, Agnes was married a year ago—she
lives— let’s see- in Melbourne !”
I suppose I could not smile, nor even look
cheerful, for kind Mrs. Kelly broke in with, “It’s
a shame. Nothing of the sort, Davie. Agnes
Elliot is in there just now; and to tell you the
truth, she must have recognised you before we
did, for she slipped-in without a word when you
were a long way off. Go in and ask her.”
I did not ask her. I only said one word, and
that was her Christian name; and when I took
her in my arms for the first time we forgot all
about mutual explanation until some time after-
wards.
Danger!
Few weeks now-a-days pass by but what the
community is startled by the intelligence that
some prominent citizen has been struck down by
sickness or disease. The constant strain on the
nerves and the cerebral blood-vessels caused by
continual attention to work, thought and business
must tell its tale in the end, the constant worry of
the struggle for existence will break up the most
robust constitution. Dr. Allen McLane, the re-
cognised authority of the United States on cerebral
disease, states that insanity is largely on the
increase through the continual wear and tear, that
he frequently has cases under his care, solely due
to extreme mental fatigue. The practice of taking
alcoholic stimulants to ensure a false energy is
most baleful, and generally results in disease of
the blood-vessels and finally paresis.
With such facts staring you in the face, and the
medical profession powerless to grapple with the
case, nothing can be done but have recourse to a
reliable remedy like Clements Tonic. This article
has proved itself the greatest remedy ever produced
for sufferers from nervous diseases and the effects of
over-work or other debilitating causes. Clements
Tonic is prescribed by the profession, because it
knows that recovery invariably follows its use,
that its uniform composition is the greatest
security for sufferers, and that its pharmaceutical
perfection and therapeutical efficacy can always
be relied on. Mr. P. J. Wallace writer from his
residence, Kangaroo Valley, N.S.W.
Dear Sir, — I have very much pleasure in bear-
ing witness to the great value of Clements Tonic
in cases of Lassitude, Nervousness, and Con-
stitutional Debility generally. For more than
twelve months I was a martyr to extreme lassitude,
loss of appetite, sleeplessness, and their con-
comitant train of physical troubles, so much so
that I feared I should have to abandon my pro-
fession as a journalist, writing being particularly
irksome and laborious to me. I tried several
advertised tonics (?) with little or no good result,
and began to think my case beyond the power of
medicine to cure. However, seeing Clements
Tonic advertised in some of my exchanges, I con-
cluded to try it as a “ dernier resort ,” and lam
pleased to say the result was most satisfactory.
After taking one bottle I found my appetite much
improved; I could sleep more soundly, and felt
refreshed next morning. I continued the med icine,
taking in all six large bottles, and gradually all
my distressing symptoms disappeared. I now feel
myself stronger than ever, and as near perfect
health as a man who has to bear the strain of
constant literary work can expect to be. I can
confidently recommend Clements Tonic to all
persons suffering from loss of nerve force through
sickness or mental overwork, and am most happy
to support my testimony with my signature.
Yours faithfully, P. Jefferson Wallace.

Disraeli, Dizzy’s nephew. This kind of thing
rarely comes off. Gladstone failed to push on his
son W. H., and Russell wasn’t satisfied with his
son Amberley. Codlingsby is said to be clever
and fluent, but no Rothschild made Dizzy. Coddy
will have to make himself—perhaps by securing a
millionaire wife, fifteen years older than himself,
as Dizzy did when he married the widow of
Wyndham Lewis, and wrote “ A man may resolve
to be great, but only a woman can make him so.”
POLITICAL POINTS
A political job lot our legislators
generally.
The Playford Ministry (S.A.j talks about
a stiff beer-tax.
New Zealand, it is plain, will not join in
Australian federation.
The N.Z. railway-employes have decided,
by an overwhelming majority, to strike if called
out.
Mr. Frank Farnell, hitherto a very un-
settled personage, is to be the N.S.W. Government
whip.
During six months ending June 30 last
South Australia exported cereals to the value of
£1,388,000.
There are only two right-out labour mem-
bers in the Victorian Parliament—Trenwith and
Dr. Maloney.
Gillies’ coalition Ministry is a black and
white contrast; Griffith’s is a rainbow ; Playford’s
a kaleidoscope.
AN AMIABLE SUGGESTION.
HE (about to propose): “I HAVE SECURED MY LAND-SELECTION AND AM
NOW QUITE ON MY FEET.”
SEE (pointing to the door): “WELL, NOW THAT YOU ARE ON YOUR FEET,
DON’T YOU THINK YOU HAD BETTER WALK?”
Since the commencement of the strike, the
circulation of one Sydney penny paper has fallen
off 9000 a day.
South Australia has expended nearly
£300,000 in immigration, or nearly £1 per head of
the population!
Gambetta’s concluding words, in his last
speech, were an appeal to maintain the French
alliance with England.
R. S. Haynes, solicitor, brother of Mudgeo
Haynes, M.L.A., is a candidate at the W.A.
elections under the new Constitution.
It is proposed to have two more Ministers
of the Crown in S.A.-—one to be Minister of
Agriculture, and the other without portfolio.
The N.S.W. Ministry pretend that they
are going to pass an electoral registration and
One-Man-One-Vote Bill before Parliament dis-
solves.
Mr. J. L. Dow is once more acting as
Victorian Minister for Lands, previous to being
formally re-installed in the billet and re-elected by
his constituents.
The Gentiles only carried the Salt Lake
elections by disfranchising all polygamists and ex-
polygamists and “all those whose relations with
women were at all open to criticism !”
The N.S.W. National Club “declines to
be responsible for the attitude of the Star during
the strike.” The Labour leaders want to know
why the National Club can’t declare its own atti-
tude.
The term of membership of S.A. Legisla-
tive Council is to be reduced from nine to six
years. By this arrangement some of the old
centenarians will actually have to go before their
constituents before they die.
A Melbourne conservative leader-writer
made an odd slip in his morning journal the other
night. He wrote that the Employers’ Union was
“hateful,” but meant “hopeful,” and had to
apologise in the paper next day.
Failing an immediate revision of the
electoral system, the N‘S W. Parliament will
consist of 140 members. At this rate, the United
Kingdom ought, on the basis of population, to
have 26,800 members in the House of Commons.
St. James’ Gazette says that Australian
Trades-Union officials “enrich themselves by
selling the right to work.” The person who wrote
that story must have been reading about the way
in which people get into a certain Legislative
Council.
People are just beginning to discover that
the much-vaunted Wales Education Act is
neither free, secular, nor compulsory. As to free-
dom : “ This account must be paid by Monday,”
writes a head-teacher on a memo, of fees sent to
the father of poor pupils.
Mr. O’Sullivan, M.L.A., says that the
N.S.W. trades-unionists are not “ socialists, nor
communists, nor levellers.” It is a pity that the
soi-disant representatives of labor in Parliament
should still be so ignorant as to see in the philo-
sophic and honorable term Socialist only a re-
proach.
In New Zealand one single bank, built by
British speculators, owns 410 square miles of
country and has a lien over some 4000 more, most
of which will fall in by-and-bye. A few other
British speculators and syndicates own the rest of
the colony. The advantages of foreign capital
here shine out conspicuously.
The Playford policy is stale as a ripe egg.
In S.A. they kick out a Ministry as soon as it is
twelve months old, and the new Ministry solemnly
asks for two weeks to prepare something, and then
they bring down the very same thing on which
their predecessors were turned out. The Playford
hash is the Cockburn hash, and so on.
Trenwith has come out of his shell a good
deal on the Radical side, and drives the Mel-
bourne Trades Hall Council on, for, in sooth, it
has a Conservative tinge and is almost entirely
formed of employers. Trenwith absolves himself
from trimming, wherefore the other side tries tc
scandalise him about his private affairs.
Melbourne Daily Telegraph tries to de-
fend the tumbling and shuffling of the Gillies’
Coalition over its Railway Scramble Bill. Ever
since Balfour, representative of Much Kirk and
More Mammon, delegate of the Pulpit and Purse,
joined the “ Gillies Reignbow,” the D.T. has held
a brief for the latter’s political salvation.
Advt. from a Glasgow daily :

Faggot-voting is worked for all it is worth in
Australia, too, but the knife is into it already.
Bismarck seems to have dried-up entirely,
the Emperor of Germany hasn’t said a word about
the precious “peace of Europe” for at least a
fortnight, the Czar of Russia doesn’t appear to be
bothered with any “ plots ” worth speaking of, the
usual earthquake in South America has forgotten
to come off, and altogether the cable liar is off-
colour at time of going to press.
Stoinfeld is the most notable Victorian
convert from Freetrade to Protection, unless
Service be held shaky on Murray Smithian
orthodoxy. Steinfeld stands for Parliament as a
bold protectionist, after his trip to Germany,
before which he was indeed the typical rabid free-
trader. He is the most influential man in the
Victorian Chamber of Manufactures. '
At last general election the Sydney wharf-
labourers threw over J. D. Young, one of the
trustees of their society, in favour of Mr. Alfred
Lamb. Now Mr. Lamb prosecutes workmen who
have left his service without due notice, and has
them fined £lO each or gaol in default. Mr.
Lamb is undoubtedly one of the best masters in
Sydney, but when will Labour learn to stick to its
own cloth ?
Labour is solid to-day. But let the Unions
now consider whether they will allow the clergy
to disrupt them, whether they will ever be foolish
enough to tight again about the Pope and King
Billy, whether one workman will ever again be
ready to bite the carotid artery of another work-
man at the instigation of the old-world bigots who
have come to make for us a hell here and show us
the way to a hell hereafter.
The economist, Professor Marshall, says
that the world has outgrown the belief that
slavery is necessary, and is also gradually out-
growing the belief that poverty is necessary—is
gradually dismissing the idea that any large
number of people are doomed from their birth to
hard work in order to provide for others the
requisites of a refined and cultured life from which
they are themselves excluded.
Ex-Attorney-General Hensman considers
the new Constitution of Western Australia, with
its members’ qualification clause and restricted
franchise, a “ piece of narrow, selfish legislation,
unworthy of a council of Chinese mandarins.” He
declines to take part in the elections under such a
“miserable Constitution,” and condemns in un-
measured terms the efforts of the old regime “ to
keep political power from the people and from
new-comers.”
G. D. Carter, M.L.A. (Vic.), is of opinion
that Trenwith, M.L.A., won’t go to Heaven,
because, if he got in there, he would immediately
want to block every non-unionist who sought to
work a harp or wear a halo; also, that he can’t be
admitted to Tophet, lest he calls out the stokers
and puts the fires out, and the half-roasted capi-
talist, and the partially-grilled employer, and the
haricot steamship-owner would be left to get cold
on the hob. Where, in thunder, is Trenwith to go?
The anti-labour proclamations in Mel-
bourne purport to emanate from “ His Ex

In the event of the daughter-begetting
spell, which now clouds the Carington family, re-
maining unbroken, the title may yet be worn by
Brother ” Rupert. The odds are certainly in his
favour, as the second eldest brother, William, (who
married a Miss Juliet Warden, of New York), is
childless, and likely so to remain. In the opinion
of a matrimonial-agency manager, this would be
a decided consideration and probably boom Brother
Rupert to 25 per cent, above his real value.

Lady Hopetoun, a little, shrinking violet,
who abhors the paltry pomp and circumstance of
vice-regal command nights,” is evincing a dis-
position to patronise the drama incog., under the
official supervision of a weird, sandy-haired aide-
de-camp, whom a merciful Providence has en-
dowed with gigantic teeth and a sweet horti-
cultural title. Half hidden behind the curtains of
a stage-box, with her face to the performance and
her back to the sassiety foe, the Victorian
Governoress seems to find as much enjoyment as
a mortal can hope for while situated in the vicinity
of the high-born spectre aforementioned, but when
stuck in the centre of the dress-circle, the cynosure
of a hundred pairs of eyes with streaks of Indian
ink round their lower lids, the distress of her
ladyship is sad to see. Obviously, the time
has arrived for theatrical managers to abolish
the old vice-regal cattle-pen, and give the
great ones of this hemisphere a chance to
take their dose of drama in a quiet sort
of way. Which reminds us that Lady Hopetoun ! s
latest unofficial visit to Melbourne Bijou was
remarkable for her persistent scrutiny of Pattie
Brown, an actress who, for reasons we blush to
think about, will be an object of vast interest to
the fair sex for the proverbial nine days ;

Quite naughty though it’s nisi.

A certain divorce-case materially increased
the business done by a Melbourne theatre. The

A well-known Sydney masher, who wears
an eyeglass, affects the law as an amusement, and
the stage as a profession, and is in some matters
dreadfully absent-minded, sat down in the Metro-
politan Hotel the other day after lunch and asked
the waiter for a cup of coffee. By-and-bye some-
body came along and held out his hand, and the
masher put into it a half-sovereign. Presently the
waiter came along for the coffee-money. “My
deah fellah ! ’ said the masher, “ I have given you
a half-sovereign, and you haven’t brought the
change.” “ Beg pardon, sir,” said the waiter, “ but
you must have given the half-sovereign to the
man who was collecting for the music outside.”
And then the band played again—but oh, such a
long way off!

bour, whose note he had endorsed for 4000 dollars
and which the injured husband will now have to

The lawyers of Melbourne have almost
unanimously resolved to swear themselves in as
special constables. Being themselves the best-
protected and also the meanest trades-union on
earth they consider it their duty to go out and
smash every trades-union except their own. If a
not should arise they will promptly issue forth and
charge the mob six-and-eightpence.
* * *
. „ The swearing-in of 1000 special constables
to preserve law and order” was certainly the
most noticeable feature of the week in connection
with the strike in Sydney. The majority of the
specials” were lawyers’ or bankers’ clerks, a
coliar-and-cuff species of young men who are
chiefly remarkable for the possession of police-
sized feet. The way they rolled up and took the
oath at the bidding of their masters— showed at
heart that they were all plucky young fellows
doncherknow. A small knot of unionists, who
stood on the sidewalk while the “specials ” came
and went, seemed to have summed them up pretty
accurately, for one remarked, “Good ’Havens'!
ancy them special constables to keep law and
order! Why, a smack from a feather-duster would
kill any of ’em.” What The Bulletin wants to
know, however, is, if law and order are outraged i
and the specialshave to come out on active
duty, will Inspector Fosbery allow their mothers
"WHERE WAS MOSES WHEN THE LIGHT WENT OUT?”

surely be general slaughter, and every young man
likes to die in the presence of some of his family.

A farmer down at Rochester (Vic.) saw
his young wife kissing one of the hands, but
didn t discharge the Lothario, because “ he was
under three months’ engagement, and the harvest
had to be got in.” Apparently the harvest was
got in, for, when the lady gave birth to a baby,
she stated that it would be a lord some day, owing
to the aristocratic descent of the other fellow.
TJp country the womenkind have a sublime faith
in blue blood, and the farmer’s wife evidently ex-
pected her unfortunate offspring to make his deMt
in a coronet and carriage-and-pair.

Another big building society deficiency,
arising, in the customary way, out of the old
cause, is reported this week. The manager, as
usual, was an irreproachable Christian, and at-
tended church regularly. He was also an unob-
trusive philanthropist, and greatly esteemed in
private life, and his principal mission on earth
was to do good to his fellow creatures. The entire
visible capital of the society is gone, and pretty
nearly everything else, barring the postage-stamps
and the grate, which were left behind through an
oversight. The floor wasn’t embezzled, owing to
the fact that it was nailed down and had the safe
and the counter piled on top of it; but probably
these difficulties would have been overcome if the
operator had had a little more tune at his disposal.
Unhappily, however, he was cut off in the midst
of his exertions, and the cold breath of disclosure
suspended the proceedings just when they were
about to arrive at maturity.

If any Australian newspaper man gets a
chance to interview the Russian heir-apparent on
his visit to this country it might be interesting to
learn that gentleman’s unbiassed opinion of his
ancestor, the venerated Nicholas, who is still
esteemed in Russia as the last Czar who filled the
bill as a Czar ought to do. Nicholas left a great
history behind him, and one of the brightest spot
in hxs career was his order that a girl in the Im-
perial school for the daughters of officers should
be flogged for writing a letter to her sweetheart.
Also, on second thoughts, he ordered that the
330 girls at the same academy should be flogged
likewise as a warning to them not to do the same
thing at any future time, and the command was
executed with the unobtrusive vigour of that era.
He was a grand old emperor, and of such is the
Kingdom of Heaven.

A little trouble arising out of the presence
of a Western financial magnate on a neighbour’s
premises at ungodly hours, and the sudden and,
of course, totally-unexpected return of the husband
of that neighbour’s wife, has just been satisfac-
torily adjusted per medium of a leaf from the
Lothario’s cheque-book. Quite a number of
N.S.W. people have lately secured substantial
sums by this increasingly popular process.
Two or three well-meant attempts to “make a
rise ” by such means have, it is true, been bowled
out, yet the plan is one which, as a rule, pays
excellent dividends, and will continue to do so
while poor, misguided man, though “game” to
make an unlawful private assignation, is afraid to
publicly confront Mr. Justice Windeyer in the
Divorce Court.
* # ■ *
The periodical Weeding divorce-case has
been poppingupinMelbourneagain, naughtier than
Visual. This time the aggrieved baker unfolded a
pathetic story of how Dr. Rose and Mrs. Weeding
swap robes de nuit, or rather of how the lady sits
on the edge of the bed simpering in the doctor’s
day-shirt while he ambles round his pansy-blossom
in a long arrangement of frills and tuckers, which
catch in his little tootsies every time he attempts
to pitch the gibbering baker out of the window.
At other times it seems that the guilty pair take a
candle into the stable for the purpose of extinguish-
ing the flame (which doesn’t blaze forever, like the
fire of love) whereupon the still, small voice of
the doctor comes stealing through the darkness
enquiring “Where was Moses when the light
went out?” In a general way, too, they
are singing hymns together, without the slightest
regard for the feelings of Weeding, who presses his
cord, disjointed nose against the parlour-window
and hasn’t heart to join in the chorus of “Room,
room, still room,” because he no sooner gets into
the room than they proceed to lay him low with
coal-scuttles and marble-clocks, and bash his pro-
trate form with a book-case. It grows very tiring.
Just at present the baker has got £lOOO damages
on a kind of judicial approbation, while the doctor
seems to be maintaining possession of the sweet
bone, of contention, and poor Mrs. Rose has got
nothing at all. In the interests of society this
long-drawn-out struggle orer one small lump of
female persuasion ought to be concluded, and then
Rose will be able to renew operations as a lay-
preacher—a line of commerce in which he formerly
shone to advantage, and is eminently adapted to
shine again.

able boys who had had no trial, and proceeded in a
mob to Government House for the purpose of
telling Gov. Carington almost in as many words
to be sure not to fail in his manifest duty as they
were ready to back up Jack Ketch. And the
worst of it was that Gov. Carington hadn’t enough
sense to see the grossness of the insult involved in
the making of such an assurance to him in his
capacity as holder of not the prerogative of
slaughter, but the prerogative of mercy.

The idea that the Grenadier Guards have
been sent to the Bermudas to die of fever and

it was there that the sybaritish Louise of Lome

A callow member of the Mounted Rifles
(now stationed in Melbourne for the purpose of
suppressing a possible “disturbance”) has been
heard to boast that the Government sent for him
and his mates “to shoot the devils down if they
didn’t behave themselves.”
What is the secret of the length to which
financial-society and other embezzlers are per-
mitted to go in Australia? Simply defective
auditing. The average Australian audit is a de-
lusion, a lie, a sham, a fraud, a farce. The audi-
tor, who gets £2O or £5O for what should perhaps
be two months’ hard work for two first-class men,
just looks in, rubs his hands, says it’s all right’
and then adjourns for whisky-and-soda with the

THE LAY OF THE MOUNTED RIFLE.
He is a Mounted Rifle,
And he doesn’t mean to stick
At any kind of trifle
lf the “masses ” dare to kick :
From a station, near the Murray
Up to busy Melbourne town
They have fetched him in a hurry—
•hist to shoot the devils down.
He would put those surly sailors
(Eor the sea h 6 doesn’t plough)
In the care of prison gaolers
If they try to raise a row ;
Or, better still—so chatters
This young gory Tory clown—
It would quickly settle matters
If he shot the devils down.
With his carbine on bis shoulder
And his bullets by his side,
No braver boy or bolder
Ever learned the way to ride ;
He is death upon “ sedition,”
He is loyal to the Crown,
And the height of his ambition
Is to shoot the devils down.
He is always looking daggers
At the “ dirty Melbourne mob ”;
In his simple way he swaggers,
He is fairly on the job;
He has forty rounds of cartridge,
And his suit is yellow-brown,
And as lief as pot a partridge
He would shoot the devils down.
He hasn’t tried to master
The position of affairs :
Sure, the strike is a disaster—
How it came he never cares ;
They fetched him from the station
To the barracks here in town,
Full of eager expectation
That he’ll shoot the devils down.
Poor, foolish Mounted Rifle,
’Tis Croesus seeks your aid
The voice of Truth to stifle—
Eor this are soldiers made;
But not as Labour’s foeman
Can you hope to win renown—

Who would shoot the devils down !

his rest at an early hour every Friday morning in

such oases. If the farrier came to live next door
to the noise he has no remedy; if the noise came to
live next door to the farrier it should be silenced.

John Lawler that the Town Hall authorities
spent £67 ss. more than they need have done
in furnishing chairs for the Centennial Hall (he
having offered to tender a supply, as per official
sample, at rates representing a saving to the extent
named) is quite another matter and calls for

The N.S.W. Cremation Society has shut
its office, and the committee have had to pay from
their private pockets the amount of the society’s
liabilities, some £6O or £7O. The fact is that an
ounce of practice is worth a ton of theory. Let
the committee get an oven, and baking operations
will soon be in full swing. The “ sight of means
to do the deed” would effectually establish in Aus-
tralia the crematory system. If the society really
means business, it should procure a small plant

At Melbourne the other day a Protestant
clergyman, who was attending a sick publican,
met a well-known priest coming out of the latter s

“what are you doing here?” “Whisht!” said
his reverence, “this is bo place for confession.”

ASouthern paper reports, with an uncalled-
for air of surprise, that a Sydney photographer
took portraits of seven members of theN.S.W.
Parliament and sent them to an eminent Englisn
physiognomist with the explanation that they
were the last seven murderers hanged in the pro-
vince. The reply was that six of them were evi-
dently irreclaimable ruffians, and the odd one,
though showing possibilities of better things, had
been brutalised by vile associations. This seems
to be coming as near to accuracy as could reason-
ably be expected.

The N.Z. Freemasons have protested
against the invasion of their country by a foreign
Masonic power, by the recent opening by Sir
Robert Stout of a French lodge. Those who
joined the latter are declared unworthy of recogni-
tion. One thing is to be said about the Grand
Orient Lodge of France—it is really and in truth
and in its effects democratic, upholding to day
those noble principles of human fraternity which
the first and most ancient of all trades-unions was
founded to perpetuate, ; whereas, sad to state,
English Masonry, having come under the wither-
ing control of princes and lords, has lost most of
its worth. The Grand Orient in New Zealand
means that Masonry will have to take its proper
place in assisting those who, in every land, are
bearing the heat and burden of-the day.

“Our office binds us,” says the priestess
Hero, at Melbourne Princess’s, and strikes a sym-
pathetic chord in a reporter’s heart
Yes, ’tis on “ stated lines ” we move,
The dull “ report” for high aims blinds us,
The paper’s “ policy ” the groove
To which through life our “office” binds us.
Though Thought may long such chains to break,
Each day that dawns for ever finds us
Still doom’d some brainless crowd to “take” —
As mere machines our office binds us.
Among us many soar, indeed,
Beyond the dull routine that grinds us,
But Leisure’s brief to think or read,
For day and night our office binds us.

A literary curio, in connection with the

says he “Make way for

of Monopoly, and sneer
at the working man. At

Some time ago Mr.
Ednie Brpwn—now N.H.
Wales Conservator of
Forests instructed a
S.A- wattle-bark agent
to collect as much wattle-
seed as he could. The
agent immediately put a
few thousands of people
on the job all over the
province, and they
gathered up all the seed
they could find. Mr.
Brown, hearing of this,
told the agent only to
collect two tons, but the
other people still went on
collecting until they had
got together over 40 tons.
The agent is now trying
to collect the sum of
£2BOO for services ren-
dered.
J ridging from recent
Australian events teeto-

designed to conceal em-

it sometimes brings out
what cleverness he has.
Nor will drink make a
man honest, but it some-
times helps him to confess
how much he has
stolen.

London Daily Telegraph observes that

Discovering a soiled- dove on the stand at
Charters Towers (Q.) race meeting lately, one of the gentle-
men who officiated as stewards requested her to “ with-
dror.” The lady of doubtful antecedents promptly burst
into tears and said that the world was a hard place to live
in and didn’t give “a pore gel no chanst.” Then her
companion, male, chipped in and swore roundly that
she was respectable, and that they were engaged to be
married. The pious steward at once interjected that if
they wanted to stay on the stand they must prove their
respectability by getting married in the luncheon-hour,
and that he’d' officiate himself. Both parties were
agreeable, but later, when the ceremony was about to
take place in the weighing-room, the bridegroom didn’t
come to scale, and so the match (also the girl) was off.

With the football premiership virtually theirs,
the mighty South Melbourne covered themselves with
glory on Saturday, by playing a decidedly “ cronk ” game
against Carlton, the runners-up. Several secret confer-
ences between leading supporters of both teams are
said to have taken place by the sad sea waves on
various evenings before the match. Result —all
the tobacconist bookies rushed by gilded youths
and fair ladies “in the swim,” anxious to take 7 to 4
against Carlton and then to lay 2 to 1 on them. Of course
the Association is to “ investigate,” and, of course, it s
700 to 4 that the charge—levelled chiefly against four
leading South players-will not be sustained. With a
little more dirt in the “national” game, cricket and base-
ball will come to the front. “A consummation, &c.

The travelled Australian boxer, like the Ameri-
can, seems to be more showman than fighter. Jackson
left Australia a modest man—one of deeds, not of words
but on the night of the Griffo-Murphy fight he prefaced
his exhibition spar with a vainglorious prologue worthy
of Bombastes Furioso, and afterwards insisted on
getting rid of an epilogue which was listened to with
marked respect by Dooley, his antagonist,. but wasiso
windy that some irreverent person invited him to snut,
up ” Him, Peter rebuked more in sorrow than in anger,
and then wentcalmlv on. Fancy anyone being so blind to
what is due to greatness as to tell a champion to shut
up !” Then he boxed a final round, and at its finish was
eager to chip in once more, but the spectators were
“ lack,” and so he let them off and majestically retired to
the dressing-room. The newspaper-fighter is a curse, but
the chin-music fighter is even worse. When a pugilist
begins to bore people with his jabber he is on the down
grade. In pleasant contrast was the behaviour of George
Dawson, the light-weight champion, hvho was presented
with a medal for his courage, skill, and civility. He is an
Australian who has not as yet grown too big for bis boots
and, though greeted with a roar of applause, retired
after the referee had spoken in return for him
Then Murphy had the calm cheek to keep several hundred
people waiting for over an hour, and on arrival entered the
rim' without deigning to make an explanation of any sort.
Then he began business as if he had a contract to knock
Griffo out in half a round, rushing at him swinging ternffic
right and left hits at Grilfo’s jaw, but the latter, who is a
a very clever boxer and looks every inch a born pugilist,
used to duck and get out of harm’s way every tune.
Murphy kept this going till he was really well done up,
then made a useless rush, and calmly gave _ this fight to
Mr Griffo.” Murphy was not apparently injured, though
he' said his hands 'were damaged, certainly was not ex-
hausted, and his excuse that the gloves were faked
was an unworthy subterfuge, which has forever shut him
out from the light of the Sydney Gymnastic Club.

A DIFFICULT CASE.
There is a certain learned Judge who sits in one
of the London High Courts of Justice who says
that patent medicines, or, what he is pleased to
term them, “quack medicines,” should never be
used, except on the advice of a medical man.
The Judge may be correct as to the large majority
of patent medicines; but there are exceptions to
this rule. If our readers will carefully follow the
history of the case below, we feel quite sure that
they will agree with us. The case in question is
that of the young son of Mr. Thomas Buzzard, of
Belton, Uppingham, Rutland, who in January,
1881, was attacked with rheumatism in the feet,
which rapidly extended over the entire body.
The family doctor was called in, who diagnosed
the case “ rheumatic fever,” and attended the
patient until October, 1882, when he gave the case
up as beyond his skill, ordering him to be sent to
the Leicester Infirmary, where, at the end of two
weeks, he was discharged as incurable. From
here he was brought home completely crippled,
and very badly deformed, his feet being drawn up
to his hips, and seemingly firmly fixed. He was
perfectly helpless, and suffered most intense pain.
As a last resource he was placed under the care of
a celebrated physician in Leicester, where he
remained for a long time, but continued to grow
worse. Having now been a helpless cripple for
over three years, and his case being pronounced
incurable by some of the most celebrated medical
men in the Midland counties, his parents were
persuaded by Mrs. Mary Ann Halls, who lives at
Uppingham, to use St. Jacobs oil, Mrs. Halls
relating to them her own case of having been a
cripple for years, and being permanently cured by
the use of the oil. A few bottles were purchased,
with the result that, after applying the contents,
the son was able to get about on crutches. Con-
tinuing the use of the oil, he became per-
fectly cured, and Mr. Buzzard, writing to
the proprietors of St. Jacobs oil under date
of 16th March, 1888, says that his son
now often walks eight miles in a single day,
and that he is perfectly cured. The case
is regarded by himself and wife, as well as his
neighbours as a most miraculous cure. From the
foregoing, as well as from many similar cases
which might be cited, it is clearly shown that the
preparation in question, although under the ban
of a patent medicine, possesses wonderful curative
properties ; and, it being an outward application,
can do no one any harm. While the learned
Judge may advise us not to use patent medicines
“ unless prescribed by a member of the medical
profession, ” there are oases, as the facts above
show, where St. Jacobs oil has accomplished in a
very short period that which the most eminent
medical men have vainly tried to accomplish for
three years, and then signally failed.
EXPERTS AND CRYSTALS.
Have you ever examined critically the crystals
used in the bezels of the Waterbury Watches ? If
not, then this will suggest so doing at your first
opportunity. Each of the glasses used undergoes
a minute and careful scrutiny in the hands of an
expert —an expert whose precision and untiring
fidelitv appear almost marvellous. Crystals are
often rejected whose defects are so slight as to
escape not only the ordinary eye, but even the
vision of foremen and trained employes in other
branches. Yet, upon taking one of them to an
expert, that person will invariably point out the
fault, and do it. withal, so quickly that one would
almost believe the spot to have been marked for
identification. The testing of crystals, rigid as it
is, is but a sample of the method and care pre-
valent in every branch of the Waterbury Watch
Co. 's factory. Precision is the keystone to their
success ; and therein lies the secret of the wonder-
ful results obtained in the timekeeping qualities
of their marvellously reliable watches at a nominal
cost. The people of Great Britain and of the
United States are eminently practical, while those
of the Australasian colonies are nowise behind
them in this particular, and the continued flow of
acknowledgments received from them could not
be wrung forth by misrepresentation, nor sus-
tained by anything else than the most deservedly
| practical worth.

THE BULLETIN (Published at Sydney, N.S.W)
The Unique Weekly, Australia’s Nonpareil
Illustrated Newspaper.
The Bulletin, the Premier Australian Literarj
Journal, is the only paper which has a con-
Bistent and distinctive Australian National
Policy.
The Bulletin favours—
A Republican Form of Government.
Payment of Members.
One Man, one Vote.
State Revenue derived diiectly from the Land.
Complete Secularisation of State Education.
Reform of the Criminal Code and Prison
System.
A United Australia and Protection against
the World.
The Bulletin denounces —
t Religious Interference in Politics.
Foreign Titles.
The Chinese.
Imperial Federation.
The public eye rejects as uninteresting more
than half of what appears in the newspapers of
the day. It is only the other half that is found
in The Bulletin.
The Bulletin is an aggressive Democratic
paper which strives to exclude from its artisti-
cally-condensed columns all matter which is not
of general human interest. The Bulletin was
started seven years ago with no capital but brains,
and has become a vast property, because it pos-
sessed a vitality lacked by the countless news-
paper-ventures in which Australian capitalists
have unavailingly spent largo fortunes.
The Bulletin’s conductors claim that ever)
progressive paper on the Australian continent has
more or less endeavoured to profit by its example
and follow its lines. The result of its powerful
influence and its unprecedented literary and com-
mercial success can at once be seen by comparing
the methods pursued by the Australian daily and
weekly press prior to and immediately after the
first issue of The Bulletin.
From the date of The Bulletin’s inaugural
publication its success was assured. It had at
once a dozen more or less servile imitators, many
of which even took, so far as was possible, its
name. They are now all dead, while The Bul-
letin continues the one phenomenal success in
Australian journalism, the one completely non-
local and distinctly universal Australasian news-
paper.
The Bulletin proprietary have, during the
last year, spent some thousands of pounds in
fitting their buildings with the latest appliances
for high-class printing and the production of illus-
trations, and they have now issued The Bulletin
in an entirely new form—printed with new type
of improved legibility on the finest paper, and
adorned with sketches from the hands of the
ablest and best-paid newspaper artists Australia
has ever seen.
The Bulletin is the only well-established Aus-
tralian journal which, throughout its career, has
been consistently Radical. It points with pride
to the fact that for years it stood alone among
secular newspapers in advocating the Irish
National Cause, and that it was the only Aus-
tralian journal which denounced the Soudan
Expedition from its inception.
The voice of The Bulletin is the beacon-fire
of national progress: it is the forceful summons to
the crusade against the monopolies in land,
wealth, power, and privilege —the direct cause of
half the misery which now afflicts British
humanity. Against the claims of avaricious
clergy who claim to monopolise salvation, against
the dark despotism of grasping plutocrats, and
against the exercise of any human authority
which has not been granted by the people over
whom it is exercised, The Bulletin will fearlessly
and ruthlessly contend.
The Bulletin, unlike the ordinary weekly
journal, is not loaded with a weight of matter
transferred from the columns of a daily paper
issued from the same office. The Bulletin is
not connected with any other paper, and the
matter it contains is all specially prepared by its
own unequalled staff.
The Bulletin, which is the only paper sold
by runners in the streets of every Australasian
capital, is the most widely-circulated of all papers
published south of the equator, and is the only
Australasian publication which enjoys a popu-
larity unhampered by the political boundaries
that so closely restrict other journals to the
colonies in which they are printed.
The Bulletin’s red cover is equally familiar
to the bushman of the Far North, the stockman
of Central Australia, the pearl-sheller of Torres
Straits, and the digger in the New Zealand
Ranges. A paper which is at once the
most popular city publication and the organ of the
ntelligent bushman must indeed be broadly based.
The circulation of The Bulletin in Sydney is
unrivalled by that of any other weekly journal,
and more than a hundred copies of it are sold in
Melbourne to one of any other paper printed out-
side that city. Perhaps the strongest proof of The
Bulletin’s popularity is found in the unchallenge-
able fact —easily ascertainable from any postal
official —that, of all journals issued in Australasia,
The Bulletin is the one most frequently re-
mailed from one reader to another.
The Bulletin is the journal which, of all Aus-
tralian journals, is most frequently quoted in Eng-
land, America, and the colonies.
The Bulletin is going ahead faster than any
other paper, because its vast mass of original and
specially-written reading matter is the brightest
and best, its illustrations the cleverest and most
artistic, and its policy the boldest and most
straightforward ever submitted to the Australian
public.

“The Conventional Lies
of our Civilisation.”
THE ECONOMIC LIE.
BY MAX MORDAU.
Beneath we reprint a first instalment of the
essay entitled ‘ ‘ The Economic Lie ” from Max
Nordau’s “Conventional Lies of Our Civilisa-
tion.” No writer, living or dead, handles
economic questions with greater freshness, and
few with equal lucidity and force ; at the pre-
sent juncture Nordau’s ideas will strike home
with enhanced vigour :
Those circumstances of our civilisation which
affect the largest number of human beings, with
the most painful and lasting results, are the grie-
vous errors prevailing in the economic world.
There are plenty of people who have never taken
any interest in abstract questions, to whom God is
a matter of as much indifference as primal causes 5
the encyclical as uninteresting as the theory of
evolution, whose faith or knowledge is alike super-
ficial. Many people also are totally indifferent to
the political problems of the day, and the number
is much larger than is usually supposed, who do
not care in the least whether they are governed in
the name of a personal king or of an impersonal
republic, so long as the State remains visible in
the shape of public officials, tax-collectors, and
drill-sergeants. But, on the other hand, there is
not a single man of our civilisation who is not
daily confronted by the question of supply and
demand. The circumstances of the economic
force themselves upon the dullest observation and
the most secluded intelligence. Every human
being possessed of consciousness, experiences cer-
tain wants and grumbles at the difficulty or rebels
at the impossibility of satisfying them. With
bitterness does he see the disproportion between
his labour and the enjoyments he is able to pur-
chase as the results of it, and compare his own
share of the gifts of nature and productions of art
to those enjoyed by others. He grows hungry
every few hours, he is fatigued and weary at the
close of each working day, every time that he sees
a beautiful or brilliant article he longs to possess
it, in obedience to that natural instinct of human
nature to attract notice and admiration to its
personality by ornamental or distinguishing ap-
pendages. Thus he is led by the circumstances of
his physical conditions to reflect upon his relation
to the general movements of political economy,
the production and distribution of wealth. There
is consequently no subject in which the masses are
more vitally interested than this. During the
Middle Ages millions were aroused to action by
the name and cause of Religion. In the latter
part of the last century and up to the middle of
this, the nations of the world were aflame for their
abstract needs of enlightenment and political
liberty. The cry for bread for the masses fills this
latter part of the Nineteenth Century. This cry
is the sole import of that European policy which
tries to turn the people from this engrossing idea
by side issues of all kinds, by persecution of some
social class, by wars, colonisation schemes, exposi-
tions, dynastic comedies, parliamentary twaddle
and civil service reforms; but it is constantly
brought back to it by the pressure of public
opinion which demands a consideration of
the great, world-wide problem of the day,
the question of how to support one’s self.
Crusades for the rescue of a Holy Sepulchre, for
the conquest of a Golden Fleece, are no longer
possible. The causes of modern revolutions are
not constitutions on paper and democratic party
cries, but the longings experienced by so many to
toil less and live better.
* * *
At no period in the world’s history were the
contrasts between rich and poor so decided, so
prominent, as at present. Those writers on
political economy who commence their scientific
works with the axiom that pauperism is as old
as humanity itself, betray either a lack of reflec-
tion or truth. There is an absolute and a relative
poverty. Absolute poverty is that condition in
which a man is partially or totally unable to
satisfy his actual wants—that is, those which are
the result of the organic act of living. Hence it is
that condition in which he finds it impossible to
procure sufficient food, or where to procure it, he
is obliged to curtail the rest and sleep which his
system requires and without which he pines and
dies prematurely. Relative poverty, on the other
hand, signifies a condition of lack of means to
satisfy the wants which man has artificially
acquired, not the indispensable requisites for the
preservation of life and health, but those of which
the individual usually becomes conscious by the
comparison of his manner of living with that of
others. The working-man feels poor when he is
not able to smoke and drink his whisky; the
shop-keeper’s wife, when she can not dress in
silk and till her house with superfluous household
goods ; the professional man, when he cannot
accumulate capital sufficient to free him from the
haunting anxiety in regard to the future of his
children and the support of his declining years.
The poverty is evidently not only relative—the
shop-keeper’s wife appearing rich in the eyes of
the working-man, the professional man consider-
ing as the height of luxury what would seem
shabby to those brought up in the luxury of an
aristocratic home —it is also subjective, as it only
exists in the imagination of the individual in
question and is by no means an objective, appre-
ciable lack of the indispensable conditions of
existence, entailing suffering upon the organism.
In short, it is not physiological poverty, and old
Diogenes proved that this is the boundary line of
the subjective sensation of happiness—viz., that a
man can be well and comfortable so long as his
physical wants can be easily and abundantly
gratified.
* # *
From the point of view of a man of this civilisa-
tion of the Nineteenth Century, who is a slave to
all the customs and wants of civilised life, the
great majority of mankind appear to have been
alwavs relatively poor in the past, growing poorer
and poorer as they are more and more removed
from the present. The clothing was coarser and
less frequently renewed, the dwelling-places were
less comfortable, the food more primitive, the
utensils less in number, there was less money in
circulation and less abundance of unnecessary
articles. But the picture of relative poverty is
not affecting. Only an empty-headed fool could
find anything tragic in the fact that an Esquimau
woman protects herself from the cold by a sack-
shaped garment made out of sealskin instead of
a complicated affair of velvet as expensive as it is
ungraceful. In fact, I doubt whether the senti-
mental wish expressed by that good king, Henry
TY.—that every peasant might have a chicken in
his kettle every Sunday—would have ever touched
or inspired genuine peasants so long as they could
eat their fill of pork. But absolute physiological
poverty, as a permanent condition, never has
appeared except as a consequence of the highly-
developed and unhealthy state of civilisation. It
is actually inconceivable in the natural condition
of mankind and even at a lower stage of social
development. The procuring of sufficient nourish-
ment is the chief and most important act in life of
all organic beings, from the polyp to the elephant,
from the bacteria to the oak-tree. If it fails, it
dies. It never voluntarily submits to the perma-
nent lack of nourishment. This is a biological
law, governing man as well as all other, living
creatures. A primitive man does not accommodate
himself to circumstances of want but struggles to
overcome them. If he is a hunter, and the game
leaves his usual grounds he starts in search of others.
If he is a farmer on unproductive soil, he packs up
and emigrates when he learns of more fertile fields
that he can get. If other men stand between him
and his food, he takes his weapons and kills them,
or is killed by them. Abundance is then the re-
ward of strength and courage. So the tide of
emigration sets from unfruitful districts into those
blessed by the sun; the heroism of a Genseric, of
an Attila, a Ghengis Khan, and a William of
Normandy, has its origin in the stomach, and on
the bloodiest and most glorious battle-fields, which
the poets sing and history loves to dwell upon,
the question of the midday meal was decided by
the iron dice.
* * *
In short, primitive man will not endure
genuine poverty—that is, hunger. He takes
up his arms against the encroaching wretched-
ness at once, and wrests for himself the super-
abundance of the enemy or dies beneath his
hatchet, before he perishes of privation. Absolute
poverty is also incompatible with a civilisation
which has not yet passed beyond the standpoint of
physiocracy. As long as a people are only familiar
with agriculture, cattle-raiding, and domestic in-
dustries, although they may be poor in money and
articles of luxury, yet the necessaries of life are
within thereachof every individual. Only whenman
loses his direct dependence upon food-producing
Mother Earth, only when he forsakes the furrow
in the field and passes beyond the reach of Nature
who offers him bread and fruits, milk and honey,
game and fish, only when he shuts himself up be-
hind the city walls and gives Up his share of forest 1
and stream, procuring his food and drink no longer
from the grand store-house of the animal and
vegetable kingdoms, but by an exchange of
the products of his labour for the gifts of
nature monopolised by others, only at this
period does the possibility arise for a small
minority of persons to accumulate great wealth
and for a large majority of persons to sink into
absolute poverty, physiological distress. A nation
which consists of free tillers of the soil is never
poor. It can only become so by the subjection of
the farmer into a slave, working for another, who
deprives him of the results of his labour on his
land, or else applies his labour in some other way,
so that he can no longer till the land, or else by
the growth or increasing number of cities, absorb-
ing or diminishing the agricultural public. A
highly-developed civilisation thus condemns a
group of individuals increasing daily in numbers
and importance, to absolute poverty. The
cities grow at the expense of the farming
population. It favours the great manu-
facturing industries at the expense of animal
and vegetable production, and produces a
numerous wage-receiving class, whose members
can not call a single inch of ground their own and
live under abnormal conditions of existence, con-
demned to slow starvation the day that their
factory, work-room or dockyard is closed. This
is the point at which all the countries of Western
Europe have arrived, considered to be the
wealthiest and most highly-civilised in the world.
Their population is divided into a small minority,
living in the midst of an aggressive and extreme
luxury, partly attacked by a very frenzy of ex-
travagance, and a great mass, consisting of persons
who can only support life by the hardest
exertions, or who in spite of all their efforts, ■
find it impossible to attain to a normal
human existence. The minority is daily grow-
ing richer, the contrast between its life and
that of the millions is daily growing more decided,
its importance and influence in the community is
hourly increasing. When we are speaking of
the unprecedented, foolish extravagance of certain
millionaires and billionaires ot our days, some
self-conceited, would-be historian is sure to in
terrupt us and quote, with a smile of compassion
for our ignorance, the words of some musty old
writer describing the extravagant goings-on in
Rome under the Empire, or even in the Middle-
Ages. He will maintain that the disproportion
between the very rich and the very poor was in
former ages far greater than at present. But it is
all only a trumped-up, learned fraud. There never
was a fortune in the Middle Ages like the hundred
millions of a Vanderbilt, a Baron Hirsoh, Roths-
child, Krupp, &0., as we know them to-day. In
ancient times such an amount might have been
accumulated by some favourite of a tyrant, or a
satrap or pro-consul, by plundering a country or a
continent; but the wealth thus amassed had no
permanence. It was like the treasures in the
fairy-tale. To-day in his possession, to-morrow
lost. Its owner dreamed a few hours, and
was then awakened by the dagger _of an
assassin, the persecution of his sovereign, or
by the brutal confiscation of his wealth. There
is not a single example of the descendance of such
a fortune from father to son for even three genera-
tions, or the calm and undisturbed enjoyment of
it by the possessor, in the Roman Empire or in
any Oriental state. And in former times, the
number of these millionaires and billionaires was
incomparably smaller than in these days, when, in
England alone, there are from eight hundred to
one thousand millionaires, in Europe altogether—
not counting any other continent —there are at
least a hundred thousand persons with fortunes of
a million and over. On the other hand, never
before were there so many property-less indivi-
duals as at present—men who, according to my
definition above, do not know in the morning
what they can get to eat during the day, nor
where they can sleep at night. The slave in
ancient Rome, the serf in Russia, were completely
without property, as, in fact, they formed part of
the property of their master, but their actual
physical wants were supplied, they had always
food and shelter. During the Middle Ages the
outcasts, gypsies, robbers, strolling players, and
tramps of all kinds were the only persons without
the pale of property holding. They could call
nothing on earth their own, no table was ever set
for them, the ruling authorities even deprived
them theoretically of the right to look upon the
gifts of nature as spread for them. They fought
their way out of the wretchedness in which the
social systems of their day sought to im-
prison them, by begging, robbery, and poach-
ing, and even if the gallows and the wheel
were more frequently the causes of their
death than old age, they had notwithstanding a
full and merry life up to the very steps of the
scaffold. The modern proletariat, or lowest wage-
receiving class, has no precedent in history. It is
the child of our times.
# * #
The modern day-labourer is more wretched than
the slave of ancient times, for he is fed by no
master or anyone else ; and if his position is one
of more liberty than the slave, it is principally the
liberty of dying of hunger. He is by no means as
well off as the outlaw of the Middle Ages, for he
has none of the independence of that gay free-
lance. He seldom rebels against society, and has
neither means nor opportunities to take by
violence or treachery what is denied him by the
existing conditions of life. The rich are thus
richer, the poor poorer, than ever before since the
beginning of history. The same thing is true of
the extravagance of the rich. We are continually
being bored by the anecdotes told by grubbers in
history as to the wonderful banquets spread by
Lucullus. But it remains yet to be proved
that ancient Rome ever saw a feast that
cost 80,000 dollars, like the ball given by
a New York Croesus, of which the newspapers
have been giving us accounts recently. A private
individual who set before his guests dishes made
of nightingales’ tongues, or presented a hundred
thousand sestertia to some Grecian hetera, made
such a stir and commotion in Rome that all the
satirists and chroniclers of those and after days
repeated his name again and again. Nowadays,
no one speaks of the thousands upon thousands
who pay 40;000 dollars for a set of china,
100,000 dollars for a racehorse, or let some adven-
turess spend a hundred thousand pounds for them
within one year. The extravagant luxury of the
ancient world and of the Middle Ages aroused
attention and astonishment by its rarity. Besides,
it had the modesty to limit its display to a com-
paratively small circle. The masses saw nothing
of it.
* # *
Nowadays the insolent parade of the wealthy
is not confined to the ball-rooms and banquet-
ing-halls of their set, but flaunts along the
streets. The places where their aggressive luxury
is most prominently displayed are the promenades
of the large cities, the theatres and concert-
halls, the watering-places and the races. Their
carriages drive along the streets, splashing
mud on the bare-footed, hungry crowd; their
diamonds never seem to sparkle with such
brilliancy as when they are dazzling the eyes
of the poor. Their extravagance loves to have
journalism as a speculator and delights to send
descriptions of its luxury by the columns of the
papers into circles which otherwise would have no
opportunity to observe the life-long carnival of
the rich. By these means an opportunity of com-
parison is given the modern wages-receiver which
was wanting to the poor man of ancient times.
The Lavish squandering of wealth that he witnesses
around him gives him an- exact measure by which
to gauge his own wretchedness, in all its ex
tent and depth, with mathematical precision
But as relative poverty is only an evil
when it is recognised as such by comparison
with others, the millionaires are exceedingly un-
wise to flaunt their luxury in the eyes of the poor,
whose misery is sharpened by the contrast. The
unconcealed spectacle of their existence of idleness
and enjoyment arouses necessarily the discontent
and envy of the labouring classes, and this moral
poison corrodes their minds far more rapidly and
deeply than their material deprivations.
* * *
But these natural deprivations must not be
under-estimated. The great masses of the poor
in civilised countries maintain their bare existence
under conditions worse than those of any animal
in the wilderness. The dwelling-place of the day-
labourer in a large city of the old world is far
more filthy and unhealthy than the den of a beast
of prey in the forest. It is by far less perfectly
protected against the cold than the latter. His
food is barely sufficient to sustain life, and death
from actual starvation is of daily occurrence in the
capitals of the world. The writers on political
economy have invented a phrase to quiet the un-
easy conscience of the rich —the “ iron law of
wages.” According to this law the wages paid
in any locality are at least what is actually
necessary to support life there. In other
words, the labourer is certain of earning sufficient
to satisfy his actual necessities, even if he has no
surplus. This would be very fine if it were only
sustained by facts. If it were true, the rich man
could say to himself, morning and evening, that
everything is arranged for the best in this best of
all possible worlds, and no one would have a right
to disturb his digestion and his nightly rest
by groans and curses. But the misfortune is,
that this famous iron law of wages is only a
Jesuitical play upon words. At the best, it does not
apply to those who can not procure work at all.
And during the time when he has really work to
do, it is impossible for the labouring man in
Western Europe to earn enough so that he can
have anything left over for days when he is out of
work. He is thus reduced to beggary during part
of the year, or to a gradual physical decline from
lack of sufficient nourishment. But the iron wage-
law does not apply even to the amount of daily
wages earned by those actually employed. What
is the minimum of income that will support an
individual ? Evidently it is that which willkeep
his system in a good condition, and allow him to
develope fully and attain to the natural limit of
his life. As soon as he attemps more than his
system is capable of enduring, or gets less food,
warmth and sleep than his system requires to
remain at the summit of its type, then he falls
into physiological distress. Overwork is as equally
the cause of organic decline as insufficient food,
but the latter is synonymous with slow starvation.
# * *
If the iron wage-law were actually what it pre-
tends to be, then the wages-reoeiver would earn
sufficient to bring his organism to and maintain it
in that condition of development to which it is
possible for it to attain, by the natural law of its
being. But experience shows us that the day-
labourer finds this impossible anywhere in Europe.
The optimistic political economist points with
triumph to his iron wage-law, when he sees that
the wages-receiver does not drop dead of hunger
at the close of his day’s work, but fills his stomach
with potatoes, smokes his pipe, drinks his whisky,
and persuades himself that lie is satisfied and
comfortable. But then comes the science of
statistics, and shows us that the average length of
life of the wages-receiving class is a-third, and in
some eases a-half, less than that of the well-to-do
individuals of the same nation, living under the
same conditions of climate and upon the same soil.
What robs the wages-receiver of the years of life
to which, as son of a given race, and the inhabi-
tant of a given country, he is entitled ? Hunger,
wretchedness, want of all kinds, _ these slowly
undermine his health and weaken his constitution.
The wages he receives are also, at best, merely
sufficient to protect him from pressing hunger and
cold ; they do not avert the gradual wasting away
of his whole being, from insufficient food, clothing
and rest. The statistics of the records of disease
and death among the labouring classes of Europe
brand the “ iron law of wages ” as an infamous he.
* * *
The portrait of the economic organisation of
society will not be complete if I omit tc
describe along with the recklessly extravagant
millionaire and the labouring man, condemned
inexorably to disease and an early death, another
class of beings who play in our present conditions
of social life, nearly as melancholy a r6le as the
industrial slaves of the great city. These are
the cultivated men without any regular income,
who have to support themselves by intellectual
labour. The supply exceeds the demand in this
branch of labour, to a frightful degree. The so-
called liberal professions are everywhere so over-
crowded that those who seek in them a livelihood,
trample upon each other until the struggle for
existence assumes in them the gravest and most
hideous phases. Those unfortunates whose efforts
are directed to obtaining a public or private situa-
tion, a position to teach, or success in art,
literature, the law, medicine, civil-engineering,
&c., are capable of appreciating their wretched-
ness in a greater degree, on account of
their higher intellectual development. Their
intimate intercourse with those more pros-
perous keeps the picture of wealth constantly
before them, side by side with that of their own
poverty, which is thus never forgotten. Social
prejudices require them to gain their livelihood in
a way which, without being hygienically prefer-
able, lays far greater burdens upon their shoulders
than those borne by the daydabourer. _ The price
paid for prosperity in their career is constant
humiliation, suppression of their true character
and denial of their own individuality, a yoke mqre
galling to a nature of true nobility than material
want. Owing to the fact that these persons are
capable of suffering more intensely, they bear with
even more impatience than the wages-receiving
class the burdens imposed upon them by the in-
ternal economy of society and property-holding.
Those among them whose efforts have not met
with success are looked down upon by the man of
wealth, who calls them failures, and affects to
despise them. But these “ failures” are the in-
trepid vanguard of the army that is besieging the
proud fortress of society, and that sooner or later
will raze it to the ground.
(To be continued.)


Sir Henry Parkes has been greatly over-
taxing his strength since his return to office.
Should he continue to work in his present style,
ugly things, the surgeons predict, will come of his
inflamed heel.
“Timotheus” the other day very wittily
transposed a well-known proverb by thus com-
menting upon some political situation “ This
may be war, but it certainly is not magnificent.”
The Melbourne Daily Telegraph editor, several
days afterwards, on the same subject, “boned”
bodily the “Timothean” brilliancy, and without
acknowledgment. How do we explain away this,
Editor Fitchett ?
Will some member of the N.S.W. Parlia-
ment ask Parkes whether it is not true that the
Government had made arrangements to land Im-
perial troops from the warships in the event of a
labour emeute? N.S.W. is a country ruled in
the name of the people, and possessing represen-
tative government. Is it true that the Parkes
Government have thus tacitly confessed repre-
sentative government to be a fraud and a failure ?

DANIEL 0 CONNOR,
[?]
846 Macquarie-street North, Sydney, September 10,1890.
Mv Dear Moorabinda,—
Already those old stagers who are prinking in anticipa-
tion of the Melbourne Cup, are elbow-deep in fashion-
diagrams, and the wise woman who doesn’t confide herself
altogether to the stereotyped compassions of her dress-
maker is harassed in her dreams by phantom gores that
won’t set and flounces that refuse to pucker. Unfor-
tunately, however assiduous the seeker, there is no future
new idea to come out with and annihilate the other woman
who hasn’t studied the subject. Draperies are plain and
straight; sleeves are humped ; collars are Elizabethan,
and hats are floral in this “ sweet Spring time ” as they
were during the winter. Patterns are to be Pompadour,
and never are, somehow, and the best-dressed woman is
seldom sprigged all over. A faint novelty will be con.
trasting silk sleeves in place of velvet; and the passover-
cake hat is rather new, though the cold-blooded milliner
does all she can to make it common-place and “as now
worn ” by sticking in an inside crown and trimming it
strictly according to the dictates of the last four seasons.
A striking mode in an era of stale styles is to have the
front of the skirt and the bodice made in one, and shaped
and tucked to fit the figure. Only the willowy Brown-
Potterish belle should adopt this novelty, however. A
full-blown female tucked round the waist would remind
the ribald of a blown-out accordeon.
And lastly, if your gown is the fashionable butter-eup
but your parasol isn’t, you will be in the outer darkness
of fashion and the Gehenna of “the rage.” In other
dresses the gamp may v ary in tone (an ugly novelty is to
trim dark parasols with light-coloured chiffon), but that a
“ yaller ” shade shall fall on a “ yaller ” shoulder is one of
the necessary “points” by which one judges a bilious
get-up this Spring. And when I have said that cloaks
will be largely worn, that mauve will be the leading colour-
and that short-handled parasols, so short that the popular
feminine trick of “ walking ” with them will be impossible
unless one stoops, I think I have enumerated all there is
worth mentioning in the market-place at present.
A point to be well borne in mind by the confiding
young man who wagers with girls is that four-button
gloves are fashionable for street wear, and that ten
buttons, no matter how scraggy the elbow, how hairy the
epidermis, is the maximum evening length for ladies.
Why is it that the Thespienne invariably goes forth in
a x wide, rakish, piratical hat hauled down to larboard and
aggravated with nodding plumes and several yards of
veil through which the gifted lady’s more or less white
teeth, and a sort of a guess at a nose, are dimly per-
ceptible? They all sport ’em—Achurch, Potter (par
excellence), Stewart, everyone—-and now the lower-rung
mimes are taking up the parable, and the sagging hat
and the bobbing feather are almost a public nuisance.
And the coiffure beneath this übiquitous gable is never
the calmly-ordered locks of common-sense, but a frenzied
touzle, reminding one of a magpie’s nest after a long and
severe difference of opinion inside.
The fair young editresses of Sydney Parthenon— a
periodical circulating in the very best circles of Darling
Point—have thrown up their task in disgust, finding that
sustained effort is bad for the complexion, and now the
next number of that absorbing publication is to be edited
by a nice young man graduate who ought to feel his posi
tion keenly. What will his Greek roots and his Latin de-
clensions avail him when the respective merits of the
pickled onion and the jar of jam loom upon the horizon ?
Where will he hide his head when the parcels-post brings
him in the broidered flannel under-garment and tucked
camisole of competition ? Sappho is not in the editoria
confidence, but she will venture to bet that the Parthenon
sewing set-to’s will shortly consist solely of shirts, or
“ weskits,” or articles well within the province of the
giant intellect which has now grasped the helm. I here give
you a superb allegory which only wants a little sifting.
The thin edge of the wedge—the wedge of seventeen
generals to tour privates—is being inserted into the
N.S.W. Cadet corps. Minister Carruthers has discovered
(from a bird’s-eye view, gained from the top of that
elongated nutmeg-coloured steed probably) that there are
enough small soldiers to form a brigade, when, according
to Imperial regulations, the officer in command must have
a plurality of colonels beneath him, who, in their turn
must have their swarm of “ commissioned ” parasites, of
course.
Lady Onslow, the leader of Maori society, is evidently
as pawky as her Southernmost subjects. She allows it to
get about that she doesn’t want to pump-handle the same
people at her two monthly at-homes, and the consequence
is that, at reception No. 2, one tea-pot holds quite enough
to damp the dusty souls of the rear-guard. By-the-by,
the Onslows have lost their French cook, and the vice-
regal menu is once more thrown upon the hands of the
private-secretary, who was spelling “ pomes de terre ” like
that at latest advices.
A small band of fifteen children formed the nucleus of
the present N.S.W. Children’s Society for the Prevention
of Cruelty to Animals, which now numbers 215 large
“ bands of mercy” in the Sydney roll. Bands have been
established at the various State schools, and the hon.
secretary assures me that great heart is put into the work
by the youngsters, who elect their own office-bearers,
correspond with the hon. secretary, and contribute to the
society’s magazine without the aid of teachers. The
magazine (which is dedicated to verse, short stories, and
the feats of the society) is a penny monthly, edited by the
hon. secretary, Miss Levy, “Oreba,” Point Piper road,
Woollahra, who is the dumb animal’s friend to the extent
of trying to abolish the fashionable bearing-rein. The
bearing-rein, I may explain, is the instrument of torture
by which horses are made to proudly champ the bit and
otherwise present a haughty and baronial appearance,
The two breathless points about the “front” on the
“Macbeth” premier at Her Majesty’s were the cocksure
cackle of the female who had brought a pocket edition of
“Shakespeare ” along, and who always howled an incident
ahead of the prevailing situation, just to air her learned
research, as it were, and the fact that almost all the
pressmen who hang on to the back of the circle or scin-
tillated in reserved-seats were in the noblest of war-paint
—even to white hyacinth button-holers. The house was
a bumper, and the d.c. and the boxes were uncomfortably
full. Miss Aohuroh made up Lady Macbeth as a pale-
faced, golden blonde, wearing in the first act a dull
crimson cloak over a spangled under-dress, kerchief of
dark-blue patterned in white ; in the third act, a bar-
barously-gorgeous attire, the front and long sleeves of red
velvet, corselet of green beads, and train of black-and
gold brocade, a crown on the flowing butter-coloured
locks, of course; while the sleep-walking scene was
soliloquised through in the flowing snowy robes of night
though tradition has it that in those good old days people
weren’t so particular about putting on clothes after they
had just taken others off. Still the stage cannot always
be archsaologically correct, can it ?
Preceded by that hysterical martyr, “Barbara,” “A
Fool’s Paradise” at Sydney Criterion seems almost light
comedy, redolent though it is of arsenic a la Maybrick.
As Beatrice, Fanny Enson—always gowned to perfection
—wears in the first act a flesh-pink silky stuff with plain
skirt bordered with gold-brown velvet, sleeves of the pink
and Zouave bodice and high collar of the velvet. In act
two, sleeves and under-dress of pale pink veiled in white
chiffon, a trained sleeveless gown of pink designed in
crimson and fawn florally, the Shakesperian collar and the
fronts of the gown faced with crimson velvet. Mrs.
Brough, who is looking more attractive than ever, has
changed her face make-up from its former chalky white-
ness to the Brown-Potter flush round the eyes and on the
temples, combined with the favourite rings of black round
the ocular to enhance the size and brilliancy of the eye
—an unexpected alteration of her usual methods
to which the spectator doesn’t cotton all at once.
She wears in the second part of this act, a fashion-
able mustard-colour woollen en Princesse, with con-
trast of brown velvet, the robe fastening on one
side and open to the feet, being trimmed with brown
buttons and guipure, toque en mite. In the last
act Miss Enson wears a charming dinner-dress in dawn-
blue silk, with picture sleeves and bodice-folds of pale-blue
chiffon ; a small Zouave front is edged with silver pom-
poms, and the scarf, which is knotted loosely in the front,
is finished with silver tassels —a delicious dress. Mrs.
Brough’s get-up in white voile, star-shaped at the neck
over gold pattern, shoes and hose of tan colour, is also
soothing in a tin-pot way.
Unlike last year, when locomotion from “picter” to
“ pictchaw ” (you may take your choice of pronunciation
—both are popular) was an utter impossibility, N.S.W.
Art Society’s private view at the Pitt-Street rooms on 6th
inst. was attended by a comfortable number of invitees,
and though there was a crush, of course, still one did
occasionally see more than the frames of the works of art
But despite the temperate attendance, it was the same
private-view-cum-Turkish-bath which ever distinguishes
these oil-and-water-colour orgies in an oblong garret
three flights up, over which the sun seems to hang sus-
pended. Next year the show will very likely be held
in more possible premises—men will be pleased to
hear, since women don’t scorch like they do—or is it that
the pearl-powder dries-up the moist signal of distress?
Miss Achurch (who brought her dutiful hubby along) wore
a thick tweed dolman and a big black hat covered with a
suffocating veil: Lady Innes wore a cool black flsher’s-net
skirt, and a Zouave bodice of warm black velvet, with coat
draperies relieved with black passementerie, bonnet in
bugles and candy-tuft and black net veil; Mrs. J. R. Ash-
ton, Indian-red cloth and black velvet, a black drawn
gauze aureole hat trimmed with daffodils ; while another
salamander seemed rather to enjoy if in purple velvet and
poplin and a hat of pansies, mignonette and gardener’s
garters.
The thing about the show which most forcibly and
quickly strikes one is the gay, Oriental brilliancy of
colouring murally observed. In some instances the
tones are cheerful to the verge of the Xmas almanac.
Mrs. Threlfall’s portrait by President Ashton is an instance
of the riotous reds and blues which dominate the display.
The picture isn’t a good likeness to begin with, and the
face-colouring is to me simply atrocious. As for the hair>
the bang has all sorts of alarming tints which I can never
manage to see in hair, while the post-cranial Psyche knot
—well, it reminded me of ebb-tide in the dye-bottle, it is
so impossibly streaky.
The portraits of the show are undoubtedly those of Mr.
E. L. Monteflore by Mr. Ashton, and that of Mr.
a’Beckett, by Mrs. Mary Stoddard. The former, a
mosi admirable and dashing effort, will undoubtedly
please the artists best; but the latter, though huug in a
somewhat obscure even if well-lighted place, will obtain
a fair share of the suffrages of the more prosaic general
public who are addicted to admiring careful portraiture
and who are not yet educated in the mysteries of im-
pressionism.
In painting a portrait of Lord Carington in Masonic
full-fig, Mr. Ashton undertook a task the prospect
whereof might well strike terror into the stoutest heart.
Did anyone ever see a sight so dreadfully vulgar—mind
you, I am speaking now only of the make-up of the artist’s
subject—as this combination of every colour under
heaven? I had just been watching the great labour proces-
sion ere entering the gallery, and when my eye first
alighted on the gubernatorial portrait it at once
struck me as a slab out of one of the gaudy street
banners. Lord Carington’s complexion, as put on
canvas by Mr. Ashton, is disappointing, for in real
life the vice-regal facial cuticle is a faint shade of cedar,
not pale powder-pink. Mr. Dan. O’Connor’s portrait
doesn’t strike me as a perfect likeness, either facially or
as regards characteristic attitude’, but then Mr. Ashton
has had the advantage of seeing Mr. O'Connor’s face in
repose, whereas whenever I have encountered him he has
always been saying something—something nice.
The landscapes of the show are unquestionably Mr.
Arthur Streeton’s “Spring Pastoral,” Mr. Pigueuit’s
“Out West,” and Mr. Lister-Lister’s “ After a Shower on
Lane Cove River.” The first-named takes my fancy most
up to now, though I must confess I have never seen fresh
water of so blue a tint anywhere, nor, presuming
that Mr. Streeton intended the water as saltwater, am
I aware of any place in Australia where grass and
oliage of such a colour are to be found right alongside an
ocean-arm. Nevertheless, “ A Spring Pastoral” is a
lovely and boldly-painted picture. “ After a Shower,” by
Mr. Lister-Lister, which has been purchased for the
N.S.W. National Gallery, seems a little lacking in trans-
parency, but it is altogether a canvas of which the artist
may be very proud ; and Mr. Piguenit’s delightful “Out
West,” with its rich evening light, will, I predict, grow
on people the more they see it. There are a lot of other
pictures among the 300 exhibited about which I should
like to say something, but present space forbids and I
must stop here.
The completion of Sydney Centennial Hall puts money
"into the purses of the various ball-committees, for it
doesn’t lend itself to decoration. There are no bald
patches of grimy grease to be concealed with a flag or a
motto, and the oiled looks of the city fathers haven’t as
yet left horizontal shadows on the civic walls. Decoration
is a towering item in ball expenses, even if you only hire
at current rates a confirmed Domain-resident with string-
tied shoes to go forth and limb the everlasting Zamia an
the tough “horse-bed” fern from their sandy lair.
“Wanted,” from a Sydney daily :
V/WANTED, by an English Lady, a SITUATION as
" Housekeeper, with boy of 9; good plain cook,
and thorough knowledge of housekeeping ; musical, if
required. Apply O. Olarilla, Boulevarde, Dulwich
Hill.
“Musical if required ”is very English, isn’t it ? But what
a position for a female Britisher if she is snatched in by a
family that hasn’t music in its soul! Fancy feeling that
her whole being is surcharged with the “Maiden’s
Prayer,” or conscious that her eye is flashing in a martial
manner through suppressed Battle-of-Prague, and all the
while unable to relieve her inwardness on the keyboard !
Awful!
It cannot be that every girl whom one meets carrying a
fiddle in a case is actuated solely by an inward worship of
Euterpe that will have vent, or else their faces wouldn’t
look so desolate. Any girl who takes up with the piano
or violin, without a distinct taste therefor, is a common
idiot. Even if she studies with a bread-and-butter motive
there are lots of other industrial pursuits less dreadful
than mastering and imparting a knowledge of an instru-
ment the crude sound of which is simple torture. Scruti-
nise the faces of the dozens of girls you meet hawking
ungainly violin-cases (too infrequently used as recep-
tacles for gloves and laces, as is jocularly stated)
and see the dull eyes, the weary mouths, the lifeless
complexions, the tired gait. They have come from a
“lesson”—the easiest part of the programme, for when
they get home, tired out, the practice commences, when
the conscientious student—the girl studying hungrily to
be the sooner herself a teacher—is obliged to stand prying
at the new “ piece ” and giving herself and the household
the ear-ache with the shrill pierce of false flat notes for
hours at a stretch. To the fiddle-fanatic all this is like
cream to the cat-but there are few fiddle-fanatics. It is
my belief that compulsory music is souring the very soul
of the rising woman, spoiling her prettiness, her finger-
tips and her temper. The unwilling violinist needn’t carry
her gun to proclaim herself. The “fiddle-face” is fast
becoming as unconcealable as big feet.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Sydney is promised a very smart theatrical performance
at the Gaiety on 23rd inst. Mr. George Clibborn- a son of
Mr. T. S. Clibborn, the A.J.C. secretary—has got together
a team of amateurs who will render two comedies to the
best of their ability to what promises to be a bumper
house.
Lady Cariugton will be at home at Government House
on 11th inst. from half-past three o’clock. On 12th inst.
Mrs, Charrington holds an invitation “at home” on the
stage of Her Majesty’s Theatre from three to five.
At the second meeting of the Women’s College inde-
fatigables it transpired that Miss Ethel Walker, the
millionheiress,of “ Yaralla,” Concord, hospromised to find
the last thousand of the £5OOO required when the com-
mittee shall have garnered in four thousand.
With Spring come flower-shows. The Manly Flower
Show (in aid, this time, of the local Cottage Hospital)
commences on 24th and ends on 27th inst., and will be
opened by Mrs. Burctekin. The Horticultural and Flower-
Show at Lady Robinson’s beach on the same dates will be
inaugurated at 3 p.m. on 24th by Lord and Lady Caring-
ton, who are paying their first official visit to the locality.
Dr. Dobson, M.L.C., is the Melbourne authority on
lawn tennis, the Privy Council appeal. We’ll take coun-
sel’s opinion on the ladies’ back-kick gyroscopic ankle.

That impertinent institution, the “Surprise Party,”
where society people invite themsielves to somebody elae’s
house and dance until midnight, is all the rage just now-
in Adelaide.
The lacrosse, tennis, - and rowing clubs connected with
Adelaide ’Varsity intend holding" “an University ball”
(as they pedantically put it) during the approaching vaca-
tion in the library of the seat of learning.
A very quiet wedding eventuated at Holy Trinity
Church, Kcw, Victoria, during August, the contracting
parties being Miss “Carrie” Henty, second daughter of
the late Francis Henty, of Merino Downs, and Mr.
“Sandy” M‘Leod, of the S.A. Stock-department.
On their return to England (where they expect to arrive
just in time for Xmas) Lord and Lady Carington will
reside at the “old grey house,” in Bucks, “Wycombe
Abbey.”
Eleventh instant is a memorable date for Lord Caring-
ton, since his first “farewell-feed” (the N.S.W. Cavalry
dinner) is billed for then at the Town Hall. It is to be
hoped he will be physically strong enough for the endless
vista of corned beef and dumplings ahead.
After an unprecedented run, the pretty but eternal
“fairy lamp” has gone out—as it always did on an
emergency, by the way. Cheap Jacks made them in
coarse “china,” the “wulgar” sported ’em proudly on
the round table in the parlor and their doom was spoken.
Miniature lamps—chimney, globe and all—covered with
dainty shkdes, are the correct supper-table illumination
just now, and are called “elf-lights.”
The indefatigable, hard-grafting committee of the
N.S.W. “ Women’s College ” have arranged for a dividend-
paying concert in the Great Hall of the Sydney ’Varsity,
which has been granted for the occasion by the com-
plaisant Senate.
Communications intended for this column should reach
The Bulletin office by Tuesday.
If out of sorts try Wolfe’s Schnapps.
There are said to be 14 known lepers in
N.S.W ; 32 in all the Australias.
Wolfe’s Schnapps should be in every house.
There is now in London a certain Miss
Leiter, a pretty Yankee who has £200,000 a
year of her own. The Prince of Wales has taken
her in social tow on behalf of his impecunious pals.

For your hearts are needed to stay the hands and
the brain from evil ken.
Your palm, girl—straight—in your lover’s,
Your fearless eyes in his eyes,
Not’for puny Self, not for golden Pelf—for the
Nation’s Soul to rise !
Strike, strike, strike !
No question of paltry wage !
The Old World is watching to see you write a line
on the Earth’s life-page.
The World has stayed from its moaning,
The World is waiting to-day, _
For a nation’s Youth and a nation’s Truth to cut
its old chains away.
Strike ! Not for Greed or Glory—
For the Land that gave you birth,
That her children may sing and her lovers cling
and the sun shine on her mirth ;
Strike ! —For the floods are rising,
The waters 6’erflow the banks,
And to save the Soil the sons of Toil must labour
in serried ranks.
Strike ! Not with deadly weapon,
With powder and pistol blaze,
But the patience grave and the forehead brave of
those who the Standard raise !
For some may faint in the fighting,
And others may seek to roam,
But the weakest there will stand strong and
square if the Standard be raised at home !
Strike ! Ay, I know ’tis bitter
To see the cupboard so bare,
To offer the children a crust of bread when the
cake was always there !
But the creed you teach the children
Is one our old heroes gave :
Better crust of bread, with erect proud head, than
the cake and cringe of the slave !
List! To the weary sobbing
That over the water steals,
Where the brain is worn and the flesh is torn with
the crunch of the ceaseless wheels.
Weak women, and little children,
And men who have had no prime,
Are bedragged and crushed, their low wailings
hushed, with poverty for their crime.
The new and the ancient cities
Have legends so sad and fell!
New York and Paris and London —do you know
what their pavements tell ?
Can you hear the worn stones echo
The tramping of restless feet,
Men old with care, girls young and fair, all tramp-
ing in vain for meat!
Is the future’s hopeless sorrow
Worth buying with the present ease,
With the Sunday dish, and the children’s wish,
■ and the hundred things that please ?
Will you risk your son’s supineness,
Will you risk your daughter’s shame?
Or stand with pride by your good man’s side, and
strike, and risk the blame ?
The daughters of the people
Are the mothers of the race,
And the working lass must be free to pass through
life with unsullied grace.
The sons you bear the nation
Must lead in the Old World’s van,
Free, their hearts to give, free to love and live,
serving Honour more than Man !
Strike, strike, strike !
Your patience shall not be vain,
It shadows the hour when Earth owns the power
of Work, whether hand or brain.
Strike, so your patient endurance
Shall loose the chained souls beyond seas
And your children say in that fair, free day:
“ Our mothers were such as these !”
Strike, strike, strike ! _
Ye sweethearts and wives of men !
For your hearts are needed to stay the hands and
the brain from evil ken.
Your palm, girl—straight—in your lover’s,
Your fearless eyes in his eyes,
Not for puny Self, not for golden Pelf-for the
Nation’s Soul to rise !
ROSE DE BOHEME.
The New Zealand Herald , lifts up its
voice in lamentation on the subject of female
labour :
In several businesses women are supplanting men ; that
is, young women are supplanting young men. This is
one part of the struggle between Whitcombe and Tombs
and the Typographical Society. I hold that for a young-
woman to" work in an unwholesome workroom at a tedious
and fatiguing occupation, is utterly to spoil her'for the
duties of a wife and a mother. Then, if she takes the
place of a young man, what is the result? That young
man is compelled to leave the country, or walk about
the streets idle. Nowadays, if a young man
wants to go to the theatre, he has to get a
girl, who is" doing less than a man’s work at much less
than a man’s wages, to pay for his ticket. And these
employments are taking- women out of their sphere.
What is to become of posterity if women are to spend the
years when they should be strengthening their frames by
household work, which is congenial to their systems, in
hurtful labour? Why, posterity would not be worth
troubling about if it depended upon them. Besides, by
taking- up men’s occupations, young women are driving
out of the colony the young men who. ought to be their
husbands. They are condemning themselves by their
owm act to the miserable fate of spinsterhood.
Just so. If woman is going to jump the claim of
man, and drive him out of the country by taking
his job from him, then the population will dwindle
away till nothing remains but a spectacled, gaunt,
old maid with a shrill voice and a cat, labouring
in a tough and ancient fashion for 15s. a week.
For if the male citizbn can’t get a billet because a
woman has taken it at half the wages, it is evident
he can’t marry till she has saved enough to keep
him, and with her humble income, the probabilities
are that she will be a bony old harridan of 62
before that joyous result is arrived it, and then he
will most likely rise up and state that he doesn’t
want to waste his bright affections on a venerable
relic with her head and both feet in the grave, and
the romance of love’s glittering dream will fall to-
pieces. Consequently, where a happy household
ought to be, there will be only a sour and wheezy
old spinster swilling tea by a lonely hearth, while
a hoary paralytic from the workhouse will call
round occasionally in a perambulator to tell her
what might have been if she hadn’t collared his
situation at reduced rates, and left him out in the
cold when he was young.
Killing the Pig: A Bush Sketch.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
This is the time of year when the thrifty dweller
in the bush who has been pampering the corpulent
hog in the choek-and-log stye for at least nine
months sharpens the family carving-knife and
grinds a fresh edge on the unassuming but busi-
ness-like wood-axe. He also sends his eldest boy
out to look for tea-chest lead, and when that
smart youth returns with a double armful which
he has “copped ” from the neighbours’ ash-heaps,
he is belted with a strip of green-hide for having
lost the bullet-mould. Then the rusty saucepan
with the cracked bottom is once more dragged
forth to the light of day and loaded to the muzzle
with lead and old jam-tins, and set on the fire
while the old man unhooks the gun from the wall
and abuses his wife for not knowing where the caps
are, and enquires “ where the blazes she put that
there powder. ” While these murderous appliances
are being found, the lead melts or is capsized by the
pet goat, or heaved out at the back-door by the
irate house-mother, because she wants the fire to
set her camp-oven on. If the melting process
is achieved without any fatalities, the hardy
bread-winner proceeds to burn many holes in his
clothes in the attempt to cast bullets. He also, as a
rule, drops several blobs of molten lead on his feet,
and startles the quiet atmosphere with a quantity of
crackling electric talk. If the house-dog takes an
interest in the proceedings, as he usually does, he
never fails to acquire a share of the fluid metal on
his moist and quivering nostril which draws from
him an agonised howl as he runs between the
baby’s legs, and spills that infant rearwards into
the boiler of water that is being heated for the
ceremony, retiring at the double as_ the child’s
mother pursues him with the rake. When the old
man has* succeeded in moulding a bullet in shape
something between a broad bean and a quartz
crystal, he loads up his gun.
* f #
All the neighbours within a seven-mile radius
are now assembled, and each one of them has
eleven separate and distinct theories on the sub-
ject of hog-slaughter. If the owner of the about-
to-be-murdered porker adopted any one of these
plans, he would be regarded as a hopeless
idiot by all the remaining citizens. But
he doesn’t. His method of proceeding differs
totally from that of each and every one of his
ad visers, and is looked upon with utter contempt
by them all. Everyone of them wants the privi-
lege of shooting the obese animal, but the pro-
prietor proudly avers his intention of performing
the onerous duty himself. As he_ shoulders the
gun and, with a tremulous assumption of cool in-
difference, proceeds towards the stye followed by
23 neighbours and his wife and family and the pet
goat in skirmishing order, the excitement is in-
tense. The affair is positively thrilling, and the
only individual whose nerves are not in a painful
state of tension is the condemned quadruped him-
self. He looks up in a mildly inquiring way as
the procession nears his residence, and then shuts
his eyes again with an air of bored indifference.
Then, amid dead silence, the chief slaughterer,
after a long aim with the gun resting on the logs
of the stye, pulls the trigger, and—the gun misses
fire. “ Powder must be damp,” he says. He puts
on a fresh cap and “tries her again’’—this time
without any other formality than just pulling the
trigger while the barrel is sagging round in a
promiscuous and strictly impartial way. She
goes off this time, with a roar like a Nordenfeldt,
and the bullet chips the left ear off one of the
spectators. With an unreasonable display of
acrimony, this person takes the gun away from
the owner and bangs it against a big rock till it is
fit only for kindling-wood and gaspipe. ihen
another spectator, whose feelings have been
wrought up to a state bordering on frenzy, climbs
into the stye and brains the pig with a morticing-
axe which he has brought on the off-chance that it
might be useful.
* * *
This diverts the general attention from
the gun-smasher, and the _ defunct porker now
gets the undivided attention of the multitude.
He is soused in hot water and cold water, and
dragged through the sand, and finally dumped
down on a sheet of bark. All hands then set to
work at tearing handfuls of hair from the carcase,
and in two hours and a-half quite a considerable
quantity has been removed, and the performers
ooze out pig’s bristle and perspiration at every
pore. But the majority of the bristles won't
come out, because the water was too hot,
as one man says, or too blamed cold, as
another opines, or because the blanky fools
don’t none of ’em know how to scald a gory pig,
as a dispassionate observer remarks. The
disembowelling process is next performed, and
the innocent cause of all the trouble is then sus-
pended to a bough, and left alone for the night.
The spectators gradually disperse, and as night’s
sable mantle falls on an atmosphere of gore and
steam and hog’s lard and swear words, the family
retires to rest. Generally somebody comes along
about midnight and removes the silent sufferer
from the scene of his woes. In that case the
amount of profanity and undiluted misery in that
household the next day is something awful in its
immensity. But if the victim does not fall a prey
to body-snatchers, there is even a greater amount
of hard talk perpetrated during the dissecting
process. Nothing in this world so demoralises a
man, takes the virtue out of him, and shakes-up
his original sin, as cutting up a pig. The only
other occasion on which he shows signs of a similar
depravity is when the hams and bacon begin to
show signs of decrepitude, become off-colour, so
to speak, ere mortification sets in. The hog-
cultivator then “chucks the whole bloomin’ lot
out,” while indulging in parti-coloured oaths.
After this, he is a miserable being until he has
paid 255. for another pig. When it has eaten
about seven pounds worth of corn, the matinee
performance is repeated, and is received with un-
diminished enthusiasm.

Tales of “The System."
No. IX.: The Little Joke of No. 6006.
(FOR THE BULLETIN.)
It would be a mistake to suppose that the
System dealt solely in the vulgar, horrible and
tragic. No impression could bo more errone-
ous than that which would attribute to It an
unrelieved ghastliness of character. It had its
humorous moments and its farcical intervals. It
invented “situations” of comicality surpassing
the extravagancies of the pantomimists. Its
records supply materials enough to build-up a
reputation for a dozen mfit-makers like George
Selwyn or Theodore Hook. Viewed, indeed,
from the standpoint of a British Governing
Official, the System itself was but one huge joke
that suffered an occasional aberration towards
seriousness.
Undoubtedly, the System was a joke—a capital
joke! Only under a System which was itself
but an expression of jocularity could the situation
have arisen which Convict No. 6006 made an oc-
casion for a little sport, by which he, at one and
the same time, advantaged himself, and rather
disadvantaged two or three other people.
* # #
On a certain Monday morning in the year
188 that very ably-conducted and respectable
paper, the Hobart Mercury, contained a death-
notice, a funeral-advertisement, and a long “Town
Talk” paragraph, all having reference to the same
person.
The death-notice was thus worded :
X.—On the 15th inst., at his residence, “The Grass-
plot,” Sandy Bay-road, Zedekiah X., Esq., J.P., formerly
of Uffeulm®, near Exeter, England, aged 63 years. Deeply
regretted.
The undertaker’s advertisement, in the cus-
tomary tearful phraseology, extended a respectful
invitation to all and sundry of the friends of the
late lamented Zedekiah (and particularly to his
fellow-worshippers at St. David’s and his brother-
members of 1.0. R., 1.0.G.T., and L.0.L.) to
follow the “ remains of the deceased” to Cornelian
Bay Cemetery.
The paragraph, owing to the great limitations
on our space, we cannot reproduce at full length,
and our quotation of a few passages must satisfy
the reader. Said contemporary ;
We regret to have to record the departure, to join the
great majority, of Mr. Zedekiah X., J.P., of Sandy Bay-
road, who, it is unnecessary to inform the public, was an
esteemed resident of about forty years’ standing. .
The deceased gentleman had, in the course of his long
and useful career, taken part in most of the public move-
ments of the colony, and was a particularly ardent mem-
ber of the Anti-transportation League, whose patriotic
labours freed this Island, the most beautiful of God’s
creations, from the curse of convictism He
was frequently urged to consent to be placed in nomina-
tion for the Legislature, but the modesty of his nature
prevented his acceptance of any other honorary trust at
the hands of his fellow-citizens or the authorities than a
Commission of the Peace, As a magistrate he was con-__
stant in attendance at the Queensborough Court, and his
decisions, founded as they were on a wide experience of
life and a more than ordinary knowledge of the law, were
seldom at conflict with equity and justice. . . Con-
siderable success had attended the business enterprises
whereon he entered after leaving the employ of the
Government in which he was previously engaged. .
In his home circle he was both respected and loved. Of
consistently pious life and a devoted Churchman, yet
there was nothing austere in his disposition, and, being
ever fond of a little joke, he was the pleasantest of com-
panions.
This elegant obituary record concluded by re-
porting the interment of Mr. X.’s remains in Cor-
nelian Bay Cemetery—that charming Necropolis
which, according to a local guide-book, “offers
the most salubrious situation and the most magni-
ficent of scenic aspects to tourists desirous of
accommodation ” in the presence of a large and
reverent throng.
» # *
Of course the newspaper put a surname
where we have put “ X.,” but we will explain why
we substitute for the deceased Zedekiah’s patrony-
mic, the algebraic symbol icpresenting an un-
known quantity. It affords no clue to Zedekiah’s
identity, so far as the public are
concerned, “X,” a quantity unknown. Again, no
other symbol or expression would adequately re-
present the extent to which that deeply-deplored
party would go in order to indulge his fondness for
an innocent joke. And, finally, Zedekiah himself
desired to remain unknown in connection with the
transaction hereinafter to be recorded.
In short, we substitute the letter for the name in
the newspaper, because we have identified with
the defunct Zedekiah, Convict No. 6006, who was
very much alive in August, 184-.
* * #
No. 6006—-variously addressed on the
Island as “ Writer Zed.,” “ Six-two-ort-six,” and
” Six thou’ an’ six ” was “ Storekeeper’s writer,”
that is, prison-clerk to the official whose duty it
was to receive and give out the Government
“ stores.” Always “ fond of a little joke,” he had
in Ins boyhood played witticisms of the practical
kind on a rabbit and a lord of the manor. Some-
how the Game Laws, Judges of Assize, and a High
Sheriff got mixed up in the joke in a rather
curious fashion, a result of their undesired inter-
ference being an inexpensive, if lengthy, sea-trip
and some other corollaries which need not be re-
capitulated. Domiciled later at Point Puer,
the “ boys’ settlement ” at Port Arthur, V.D.L.,
the Rev. Mr. Manton, Chaplain and School-
master, received No. 6006 into his especial favour.
Mr. Manton, good man, placed him in a monitor-
ship and gave him a sound drilling in reli-
gious doctrines and the three R’s. Re-
moved at the ago of 20 to Oatlands gaol,
as assistant writer, he was soon enabled, by the
companionship he there enjoyed, to qualify for
Norfolk Island by a second conviction. Imitating,
in another jocular moment, Mr. Manton’s n'gna-
ture, and affixing the copy to an order on a Hobart
Town tradesman for certain goods, he obtained
the articles, sold them, went on the spree with the
money, and after an interview with Chief Justice
Pedder, found himself on his way to the Island.
His expertness with the pen, coupled with a letter
conveying Mr. Manton’s testimony to his
familiarity with religious dogma (which document,
we regret to say, was forged) obtained for him,
immediately on arrival, the much-coveted billet of
a writership, and he had been general factotum to
the storekeeper for a couple of years when C. C.
Scragge gave his picnic party.*
# # *
When Knatchbull, the Commandant’s
writer, set about the work of preparation for that
high officer’s festival, the one “ free ” clerk in the
“Office,” Mr. Sutherland, had applied for and
been granted the services of the storekeeper’s
writer, No. 6006, so that the heavy clerical work de-
manded by the routine should not fall into arrear.
Zed. had, on prior occasions, assisted the office
staff, and was quite conversant with the manner in
which things were done and left undone there.
He did not, therefore, experience the slightest
tw 'tcn of surprise when on the picnic morning
and half-an-hour subsequent to the departure of
the party of picnicers from the Grassplot, Free
Clerk Sutherland threw him a couple of figs of
tobacco, and gavehirna “snifter”of nun. No. 6006
perfectly understood that he was thereby bribed
to do the Free Clerk's work for the day in addition
,i' >Wn ’ au(l Nearly apprehended that the
F .C., disgusted at not being included among the
Commandant s invitations, was determined to
have a little amusement on his own account. As
a simple fact, the F.C. went for a very enjoyable
day’s shooting in the scrub at the base of Mount
Pitt.
* * #
Writer Zed,, being left alone in the office,
and knowing that in the absence of the superior
officials he would be undisturbed for several hours,
didn’t see why he also shouldn’t have some fun.
His idea of fun, of course, meant doing what he
ought not to do. He began his self-entertainment
by filling and lighting his pipe. We may here
interject that the tobacco with which he filled it,
aS as rum which he had previously ab-
sorbed, were the “special medical comforts” of
“ Lifer ” Kelly, who was in the hospital with a
broken leg. The F.C. was also hospital dispen er,
and, in diverting to his own use and profit many
articles intended for convict “comfort,” he was
merely doing the regular thing. The System
devoutly believed in honesty—for other than its
administrators.
Now, in the very first hour of No. 6006’s tem-
porary tenure of Knatchbull’s post, he had noticed
that the books of official communications,
brought to the C.C. by the Governor Phillip brig
on her last trip, were still unopened. As pre-
viously recorded, Commandant Scragge had gone
on a drinking-bout, as soon as the brig’s arrival
permitted him to repleni-h his liquor stock; and
he had barely recovered from this orgy, when ti e
preparations for his picnic claimed his attmtion.
The few bundles of correspondence that he had
withdrawn from their wrappers had accordingly
been but cursorily examined, and the mass of the
despatches were as yet untouched. The custom
of the Comptroller-General’s department in
Hobart I own was to allow documents needing
transmission to the Norfolk Island authorities to
accumulate till the succeeding voyage of the
Governor Phillip (the brig made four trips yearly),
and then forward all papers of a like character
enclosed within one cover. Thus, all “Comp-
troller’s minutes on Civil Commandant’s reports,”
however numerous, would be covered by one
wrapper; “Storekeepers’ Summaries,” by
another ; “ Schedules of Transfers,” or the list of
“ Commitals to Norfolk Island from Y.D.L.,” by
a third ; and so on. Upon the wrapper of each
would be endorsed the description of its respective
contents.
Turning over the heap of despatches that still
bore their seals intact, for no earthly reason than
that he knew he should not touch the papers on
the Commandant’s table at all, No. 6006 observed
that one thin, unopened packet was t bus -id
dressed :

19th August,
The CIVIL COMMANDANT,
H.M. Penal Establishment,
NORFOLK ISLAND.
Office of the Comptroller-General of Convicts,
„ Hobart Town,
J.F. 18/8/4—
Convict No. 6000 took the envelope in his
hand and inspected it with a keen curt si tv
wondering the while how long it would be before
his “discharge” came in that way. The idea
would project itself into his mind that when his
order lor freedom arrived, it would reach him as
it reached most of the prison-population of 'the
Island, That is to say, it would be wrapped
round a bullet, or dangling on to a rope's-end, or
tendered on the point of the surgeon’s scalpel
Twenty-four years old—and he had still to servo
four years of his original sentence, and ten on top
of that for the Y.D.L, forgery ! Fourteen years
which ought to be reduced to ten, if he gave no
chance to his capricious masters to complain of
him, and no opportunity to the hundred or so of
fellow prisoners who were hungering for his billet
to “ put him away ! ” Ten years ! And then’
perhaps, he would go out into the world with the
infamous brand of a “Norfolker” upon him -out
unto the world which when it was not a stabbim-
world was a jeering world ; but, perhaps, on the
other hand, he would, by the time he was “duo
for freedom,” have learnt to love his chains, and
have grown friendly with granite escarpments and
the fringes of coral that held him within their vyce-
like grasp. Convict “ Six-two-’ort-six ” shuddered
as these thoughts stirred him ; shuddered— and
then laughed aloud with a harsh and scabrous
laughter that, had it claimed a close cousinship
with the bitter cry of pain, would have had its
demand admitted. Laughed and shuddered
again; and the gusty passion which so often
seized prisoners denied the ordinary channels of
venting their temper gripped him; and, throwing
the packet on the matted floor, he stamped on if
His canvas slippers— “regulation ” issue to all
men in “ light billets ’’—were fortunately nail-less
Their flushed sprigs did not mark the envelope •
and the only damage done was the breaking of the
red-wax seal. That lay in a dozen dull-glinting
fragments.
Convict 6006, his mad spasm expended, picked
the letter up with some confused notion of re-
placing the lumps of wax on the wrapper, but a
moment’s consideration showed him the useless-
ness of an attempt of that sort. So he searched
for the Commandant’s official seal. He knew it
was somewhere about, for the C.C. had, the pre-
ceding day, cursed the Comptroller in diverse
forms of imprecation for having failed to fill the
requisition for a new seal. When the Island
had been handed over by New South Wales
to Van Diemen's Land the year before,
a fresh seal had _ been ordered from Hobart
Town, but, so far, it had not turned up, and Mr
Scragge had, perforce, to use the old one. There
was no difference in the designs of the depart-
mental seals of the two colonies, save in the ini-

tials of the colony. Circular in shape with a
crown in the centre, the legend, “Penal Estab-
lishment,” curved above the symbol, the letters
“N.S.W.” or “V.D.L.” filled the base. The
impress of either seal would pass on slight exami-
nation for that of the other, so close was the re-
semblance of the instruments. Such, at all events,
was the conclusion of Convict “ Six-thou’-an’-
Six,” as, after discovering the seal in the 0.0. ’s
private and locked drawer, he dropped a pool of
wax on a scrap of paper, pressed the stamp upon
it and compared the result with one of the sealed
packets from Hobart Town. And Convict “ Six-
thou’-an’-Six ” was so well acquainted with
Soragge’s habits that he knew the seal would not
receive even a cursory inspection. A few days
before the brig started on her return voyage the
C.C. would rush into the office, tear off rapidly
the wrappers of the remaining despatches, and
distribute most of their contents among the avail-
able “clerical strength ” co be acknowledged and
attended to.
That was the Civil Commandant’s method of
management, and No. 6006 was quite easy
in his mind as to the prospects of the
substituted seal escaping detection. Very
likely Scraggs, indeed, would never notice
the absence of the seal, but, nevertheless, No.
6006 thought he had better be on the safe side,
and he was accordingly about to drop a lump of
heated wax on the packet when the thought
occurred to him that he might as well know who
were “ down for freedom. ” What a capital joke
it would be to set a rumour floating about the
Island in the curious way that authentic reports
and well-founded information were accustomed to
circulate —originating no one could say how,
transmitted no one would say whence —that Such-
and-Such a Number was booked for liberty. What
a joke to hear the protests from the man himself
that “ it was too good to be trueto listen to the
junior officials indignantly scouting the notion as
utterly improbable ; and then for the fact of the
discharge to come out a week later by the voice of
the Commandant himself. Perhaps this may not
strike the reader as being a very humorous con-
ception, but Convict No. 6006 knew it would be
regarded as a brilliant joke on the Island, because
it would “dish” the C.C. One of Scragge’s
pleasing characteristics was to withhold from the
man concerned and the subordinate officers the
knowledge that a prisoner had been pardoned or
otherwise discharged till a few hours before the
time of the departure of the brig; and nothing
annoyed him more than to have the effect of his
announcement of the fact discounted.
So No. 6006, being fond of his joke, determined
to learn who were “ down for freedom ” from the
documents wrapped in the packet. Scarcely sooner
determined upon than the thing was done. The
opening of an official envelope was less difficult
than the forcing of the lock of the C.C.’s private
door, which had taken the accomplished No. 6006
exactly one minute and ten seconds by the Settle-
ment clock.
There were precious few things, let us say. re-
quiring a deft touch that Convict No. 6006 couldn’t
do; and fewer still of the artistic methods of
manipulating documents with which he was not
acquainted. Old Pounce, ex-scrivener’s clerk and
five-times-convicted forger (he had been cast for
death twice —once in the old country and once in
Sydney) and principal writer at Oatlands Gaol,
had no reason to be ashamed of his pupil. He had
taken No. 6006 when he was comparatively inno-
cent, having little more on his conscience than
that poached rabbit, and he had made him an
expert “penman.” “Boy,” he had said to his
scholar, when he was shown the forged order on
the Hobart Town tradesman, before it was uttered,
“Boy, you do me proud!” He was always
paternal, was old Pounce.
But we are digressing. We left No. 6006 read-
ing the documents he had withdrawn from the
now-nnsealed packet.
The first he took up was the Schedule of Re-
transfers—men who, for various reasons, were to
be shipped back to V.D.L. The schedule included
but six names, and as none of them belonged to
men numbered in the list of “ six-thou’-an’-six’s”
friends, he was not interested in it.
Then he took up the abstract of “ Orders for
Discharge.” Three men were down for release
therein —Edward Hogan, Simon Sugden, John
Julius.
“Gosh!” said Writer Zed., to himself; “I’m
blest if the Gov’ment ain’t gettin’ liberal. Three
men a-quarter freed out o’ nineteen hundred!
Why, it’s a whole dozen a-year ! Ain’t they
generous ! ” And he stopped his reading of the
papers to calculate how long it would take to de-
populate the Island at that rate, and allowing for
no new arrivals.
“A hundred an’fifty-eight years ! Lor’, it’s a
d d good thing for Gov’ment that Skeleton
Johnny* takes a hand at th’ game ! What ’ud
Gov’ment do without Jack Ketch and the
Croaker ?+ Fancy a-rationin’ us all for a hun-
derd-an’-fifty years ! ” And he almost regretted
that he was not compelled to mess in one of the
big yards so that he might repeat the jokelet to
ten score of prisoners and so set the table in a roar.
Having sufficiently enjoyed his own pleasantry
for the time being, he continued his perusal of the
enclosures. Attached to the “abstract” were
some other papers. These were the “Discharge
Orders. ”
“ Hogan, Sugden, Julius—none of ’em my pals,”
he reflected, as he scanned the sheets, and then he
suddenly recollected that he did know Hogan.
“Edward Hogan—why, o’ course, that’s Ned
the Bricky, th’ ol’ cove I give th’ ’baccy to when
Greenwood’s gang was buildin’ in th’ new oven for
th’ bakery.”
This was a fact, and, perhaps, the circum-
stance is worth narrating as showing how the
System worked in little things. Old Ned, seeing
the “Writer” standing at the store-door, had, in
the mute language that all Government men un-
derstood, begged a bit “o’ th’ stuff.” No. 6006
had only enough on him for that night’s “ chaw,”
but he was aware that, except by a miracle, poor
old Bricky would not taste the weed for a twelve
month together. So, though the act would be one
of uncommon self-denial, he resolved to give him
the remains of his fig. First, however, he would
have his little joke.
He went up to the gang and spoke to Hogan.
The Bricky, on pain of “ cells ” or the “ tube gag ”
dare not speak to the Writer, but the Writer,
being in a fair degree of favour with the Settle-
ment bosses, would not be informed on by Works-
Overseer Greenwood for addressing Ned.
“Bricky,” quoth the genial Writer, “you’d
like some ’baccy, wouldn’t you ?” As the magic
words fell from No. 6006, the Overseer and all his
gang pricked up their ears. The former expected
“a case” for Darrell; and the latter fellows
thought that if there was any of the “stuff”
going to be about they might “stand in for a
chaw.”
“Ned the Bricky” glanced round fearfully at
the Overseer, but Greenwood’s eyes were turned
the other way—purposely. Then Ned dared to
look his acquiescence ; a look of feverish, hungry
consent.
“But, Bricky,” went on No. 6006, “it ’ud do
you harm ; the croaker says th’ immoderate use o’
’baccy injures di-jestshun, spoils gastric juices, you
know—l ’udn’t like to do you harm, Bricky, an’
if your di-jest-shun was spoilt, you c’udn’t enjoy
that fowl an’ green peas what you’re goin’ to have
next Sunday when th’ Comm’dant asks you to
dinner !”
Bricky, stupefied by over a quarter of a century
of Government work, didn’t quite follow the
Writer’s pleasant jesting. He knew, however, he
was being laughed at, and the light went out of
his seared and lash-bitten face. The Overseer and
the others chuckled merrily,
“And, parson says,” proceeded No. 6006,
“ that it’s good for th’spirit to mortify one’s de-
sires. Now, Bricky, take my advice, I’m a young
’un, Bricky—but I’ve seen more o’ th’ world ’n you
—you ain’t been travellin’ much o’ late
years, Bricky, have you ? You’re one o’
th’ stay-at-’omes, ain’t you, ol’ chap?”—the
sentiment in the gang was now that the store-
keeper’s clerk was quite a funny dog!—“Now,
just you mortify th’ flesh, and don’t indulge in no
desire for ’baccy! Do that, Bricky—an’ lor’!
before you know where you are, you’ll have your
wings a-sproutin’ an’ go where all th’ good ’uns
like Parson Ford, an’ Tommy Taylor, an’ Mr.
Scragge’s a-goin’. Good day, ol’ chap; don’t yer
bother ’bout no ’baccy—’baccy ain’t good neither
for your soul nor body.” Greenwood had
turned away, convinced No. 6006 was simply on
joking bent, and—a rapid movement of the Wri-
ter’s wrist, and a splash of mortar from old Ned’s
trowel covered the oo veted half-fig. Bricky’s wings
didn’t sprout exactly, but he spent the succeeding
two nights in Elysium. “ Six-thou’-an’-six” might
be fond of his joke, but there was a lot of good in
him. The good proved itself (to society’s satis-
faction) in the later days, when Zed. became a
churchwarden, and a Grand Something in the
Good Templars; but we’ll vow his gift of tobacco
beat his after-deeds by a long head. It cost him
something, you see; it was pure self-sacrifice,
which couldn’t be always said of his doings when
he was “respectable.”
It was this Ned the Bricky whose order of dis-
charge we left No. 6006 perusing. He was specu-
lating as to what the miserable devil would do
with the morsel of existence that remained to him,
when he saw, pinned to the back of the foolscap
sheet, a note addressed to “0. C. Scragge—Pbi-
vate.”
“That’s Chief-Clerk Scribbins’s fist,” he said,
as he recognised the superscription. “What’s in
it, I wonder ?” He wondered just as long and no
longer than it took to open the note, and he, much
interested, read therein as follows :
H. T., 15 August, 184 —.
My dear Scragge,—l want you to do me a favour—or,
rather, Slyde. Slyde doesn’t care to address you direct
on the matter. I suppose he thinks you would not do it
for him, as perhaps you still bear him a grudge for getting
that girl away when you wanted her (though I don’t see
why you should, seeing the devil of a row into which he
got over the jade), and as he had, in any case, to ask me
to put the thing straight in our books here, he has left it
with me to make it right with you. The case is this : A
man named Hogan came out per Neptune in 1808 under
two sentences, one of 10 and the other of 21 years’. He
was a bricklayer by trade, and so Macquarie kept him at
work for Government instead of letting him out, and it
must have been because he was a good hand that he was
sent to the Island, as no prison offence can be found re-
corded against him. Now, supposing he was entitled to
no remission (as he must have been, as there is no gaol
offence) he was due for liberty in ’39, and, of course, has
overstayed his time some years. According to your last
annual Abstract of Gaol Strength he was included in your
Works Gang.
It appears that by some negligence at Sydney, for
which Slyde says he will be held responsible unless we can
adjust matters, the fact of the old wretch being due for
discharge was overlooked, and has only now been dis-
covered on the Sydney people writing off from their
records all men transferred to ns when this Government
took over the Island last year. Now Slyde wishes me to
fix up the thing here, and you to square'the books at your
end. He wants me, and you through me, to put one or
two prison offences against the fellow, so as to make it
appear he has done the extra time regularly, and you
can easily fix it. up, if you like. A few years ago
a slip of this kind would not have mattered either one way
or the other, but with these d—d newspapers poking their
noses where they are not wanted, we have to be careful.
Do it, there’s a good fellow, and let me have particulars
so that I can make my books straight here. Of course,
it’s just possible that Hogan was really entitled to do
extra time through committing some offence with you,
and that it has not been reported. This, however, did not
occur to me till after I had got the old man to authorise
his release as a “ special grace remittee,” so, having got
the order, I think it best to let it go. I needn’t say the
old man doesn’t know of the real reason. He’d be only
too glad to pick a bone with the Sydney lot. By the way,
he says you’ve been reporting too many suicides recently.
He says you ought to know better— fix them up as “acci-
dental drownings,” or “escapes.” He’s afraid of those
infernal newspapers—wishes, every day, old Bose was
back again to run the Courier on Government lines and
back up the System. We sadly want an organ. Ta-ta !
kind regards. Hope you will like the latest addition to
your garrison, Mrs. Browning, who goes up by the brig
this trip.
Sincerely Yours,
George S. Scribbins.
P.S.—Of course Hogan must not suspect he’s done over-
time, so keep the fact from your writers. I know the
fellows: they’ll blab. I’d take it out of the man somehow,
though, if I were you. Fancy his getting at Government
for his keep all these years—why, he ought to be flogged
for stealing rations.
G. S. S.

Thanks to Mr. Pounce’s admonitions—
Pounce had one or two gentlemanly instincts lin-
gering in his nature —No. 6006 had conceived a
dislike to the blasphemous and obscene forms of
ejaculation. “ Leave all such to the officers,” was
Pounce’s advice, and his pupil had followed it, as
he had followed worse counsels. So, now, although
in the extreme of amused surprise at the peculiar
humour of hfr. Chief Clerk Scribbins, and
although obeying a necessity to say something
very strong indeed, he did not swear. Not he ;
but he used the most expletive expression in his
vocabulary, and exclaimed :
“ May Ibe Parson Eord-ed, if I thought Mr.
Scribbins ’ud ha’ written that! Lor ! How he’s
changed—he ’udnt ha’ written so once. ”
The System being sui generis a Thing by itself,
had its peculiar language and its distinctive
figures of speech. To be “ Parson Ford-ed ” was,
in convict vernacular, to be reduced to the level of
that eminent ecclesiastic, who, to the convict
mind, symbolised everything damnable. No.
6006, who had been under Scribbins at Port Arthur
when the latter was Commissariat Clerk, and a
very good master to the prisoners, was greatly
surprised by the tone of the private and con-
fidential note to Scragge. “ How Scribbins must
ha’changed for the wuss !” he repeated. “It’s
that Corn’troller as has done it, I’m sure.”
Perhaps “the old man ” was partly accountable
for Mr. Scribbins’ observation; but Zed.
didn’t make sufficient allowance for the System of
which the “old man,” though Comptroller of
34,000 convicts, was a comparatively insignificant
factor. “The System, your Excellency,” as
Chaplain Taylor said when handing in his resigna-
tion after 14 years’ battle with it —“the System
would convert Patinos into Pandemonium, and
transform St. John into Beelzebub.” It would
have been an exceptionally curious circumstance
had Scribbins not changed for the worse.
» * *
No. 6006 replaced Scribbins’ letter in its
cover, and was re-folding the “Orders for Dis-
charge ” when the notion suggested itself to him
that it was a pity that order was not in his
favour instead of old Bricky's. What the dickens
would Hogan do with his freedom when he got it ?
Over 70 years old, and after a half-century of
convict routine, what would he do with it ? Get
“into trouble ” again the first hour he spent in
Hobart Town—that’s what he would do with it,
to a dead certainty. And there was he,' No. 6008,
still young and hale, whom the System had not
robbed of all vim and vigour—he* was to stop—
stop—stop within that sea-girt prison ! The
thought was maddening. Why was his name not
in that order, and that abstract, and not Hogan’s?
Why shouldn’t it be ? And then his little joke—
the joke par excellence of his life—assumed bodily
shape.
No. 6006 did not go for his mid-day ration,
and as, being a “billet” man, he was not mustered
except on Sundays, his absence excited no com-
ment. He was, in his judgment, much better
employed than in masticating what remained of
his sixteen ounces of meat and eight ounces of
potatoes after boiling-down and the peculations
of the cooks. He spent the shining hours in
making a slight alteration in the wording of one
the discharge orders.
He did not touch the body of the document,
which was partly printed and partly inscribed to
this effect :
H.M. Penal Establishment,
Hobart Town,
17 August, 184—.
This is to command you to release from your
custody the body of the prisoner named in the
margin, his Excellency the Governor-in-Council
having been pleased to remit the unexpired por-
tion of the sentence passed upon the said prisoner
in due course of law.
(Sd.)
James Fubster,
Comptroller-General of Convicts.
To the Civil Commandant and Gaoler,
H.M. Penal Establishment,
Norfolk Island,
V. D. L.
He only made a slight alteration in the name
noted in ting margin. For “ Edward Hogan, per
Neptune, No. 10,131,” he substituted “ Zedekiah'
X , per Morley (boys), No. 6006.” Nor did
he touch the manuscript footnote—
The swithin-nauied prisoner to have free passage pe r
Government brig to Hobart Town.
Sd. J.F. 12/8/4 --
You may wager your life, he didn’t alter that!
After he had manipulated the Discharge Order,
he devoted some little attention to the Abstract.
The paper on which this document was prepared
was of a more substantial character than the woven
foolscap of the Order, and occasioned him less
trouble in substituting for the particulars of Mr.
Hogan’s identity those relating to himself. The
result in both cases was satisfactory.
“There,” he said, as he finished. “I don’t
think old Pounce ’ud be ashamed o’ his pupil. ’E
c’uldn’t ha’ done ’em better himself! ”
He was re-folding the papers, when his eye
caught the solitary “Pardon” contained in the
packet. He opened the parchment, and found
that it was a “ Conditional Pardon ” in favour of
Walter Edward Tappin, No. 18,969, per Governor
Ready.
“Phew!”ejaculated No. “six-thou’-an’-six” “A
‘C.P.’ for his Worship lying here all these ten
days past, an’ him gettin’ ‘cells,’ an’ bein’sent
to D Gang all the time! Well, it’s too jolly
aggervatin’! ” And having made this friendly
and sympathetic observation, he proceeded to close
the packet and to seal it—taking especial care with
the sigillatum, you may be sure. The operation
concluded, he again recreated himself with a
hearty laugh. Yery musical was his laughter this
time ; there was nothing harsh' about it, nothing
bitter. Why should there be? Wasn’t it a splen-
did joke that he was playing on Scragge and the
Establishment generally ? And then he began to
prepare himself for the sudden shook which his
nerves would receive when the fact of his dis-
charge having arrived would be communicated to
him by the Civil Commandant! If the C. 0.
failed to perceive that the seal on the “Release ”
despatches was not a “ V.D.L.” one, but the . old
“N.S.W.” stamp, there would be nothing to
excite suspicion, and it was a thousand chances to
one against his noticing the wax impression. Ex-
ternally, with that exception, there was nothing
to show Scragge the packet had been tampered
with.
* * #
Internally, the papers were the same, ex-
cepting the verbal alterations already noted, and
in one other particular.
Convict No. 6006 did not think it necessary to
re-enclose Mr. Scribbins’ confidential letter to the
C.C. ; thought, indeed, it would be preferable to
retain that note in his own possession, and for this
very good and all-sufficient reason—that note was
his trump-card.
The routine on the discharge of a prisoner in
pursuance of formal order, or by the fiat of Death
was for the Island Authorities to advise the Comp-
troller-General’s Department in Hobart Town by
the next trip of the brig, so that the prisoner’s
“ record ” might be entered up. The Island Office
would notify the Department when Convict No.
600(i took his departure, and then, of course, the
fraud that that jocular individual had perpetrated
would be discovered. On the happening of this
contingency, which was less of a contingency than
a certainty, No. 600(5 determined to throw down
his trump. And he smiled and laughed and
danced as he reflected that there could be no
doubt of his winning the trick with it.
* * #
Events foil out pretty well as our joker
anticipated, though one thing he could not fore-
see. Convict John Knatchbull was not imme-
diately re-instated as writer, and so No. 6006 was
kept at work in the Commandant’s Office.
One morning in the week following the picnic-
party the C.C. rushed impetuously into the office.
“Look here, Sutherland, and you, Writer Zed,,
you’ll have to buckle to to-day and to-monow.
Skipper says he must go in a couple of days, and
we’ve all the last mail’s despatches to go through !'’
Seating himself, he hastily tore off iho wrappers
of the unopened bundles, and glancing at their
contents, threw those which could be attended to
by his subordinates on to his desk and then called
to No. 6006.
“Here, Writer, glance over these abstracts, and
tell me whom the Comptroller is going to take out
of this d d hole —some of my most useful men,
I expect!”
No. 6006 obeyed. He took the papers-includ-
ing the ones which ho had manipulated—-and read
out calmly the “Schedule of Re-transfers.” Then
he took up the Abstract of Discharges, and began:
“Zedekiah X ” He stopped—gasped out
“ O, God !” —and fell to the floor in a fit.
It must have been a capital piece of acting, for
it completely deceived both Scragge and Suther-
land, both of whom were tolerably familiar with
the epileptic shammer.
“They’ve discharged him, sir,” said Sutherland,
“and the sudden discovery of it has knocked him
over. ”
“So I presume,” growled the C.C. “ Too bad
of Dabster to take away one of the few steady
writers we have.”
Zed. revived at this juncture. “Oh, sir, beg
pardon, sir—l’m sure —gom’ off like this, but—
you see, sir, ’twas such a surprise—sir—my head
swims so—l hardly know yet—■whether it’s true ! ’
Scragge picked up the papers. He glanced over
them. “ Yes, it’s true enough—but why the
devil —(this with a sudden suspiciousness)—they
didn’t send, a O.P. instead of a Discharge I don’t
know, with all that time to do. I don’t know.
Or, indeed, why they should release you at all.”
No. 6006 had got up, and said, tremulously :
“ I think, sir, they’ve given me a discharge’ stead
o’ a pardon, because, sir, ’twouldn’t ha’ to be
gazetted, and pe’pie ’udn’t talk !”
“ But why should they give you a discharge at
all now—that’s what beats me!” persisted the
Commandant.
“Oh, sir, don’t Tike to mention it—but you see
I’m a great man’s son.”
“ The deuce you are !” - -
“Yes, sir—a nobleman’s son—over the left,
, sir—what you call ‘natural,’ sir. He let me be
lagged, but I know’d he’d relent by-and-oye.”
And artful 6006 here wiped away, what seemed to
be a tear.
“Oh,” said Scragge, “if you’ve got powerful
friends, that explains all !”
“ Powerful friends ” explained a lot of things in
the System.
# * *
A fortnight later No. 6006 played his
trump card. Within an hour after the Governor
Phillip hauled up to her moorings in Sullivan’s
Cove, in the Derwent, he walked into the pri vate
office, in Murray-street, of Mr. C. S. Scribbins,
Chief Clerk to the Comptroller-General.
Mr. Scribbins looked up from a pile of Mr.
Scragge’s despatches—amazed.
“You here, Zed.? —I thought you were doing
your time at the Island. Never expected to see
you again!”
“ Ain’t you read Scragge’s despatches, sir ?”
“Scragge! No, Mister”—Scribbins couldn’t
believe his ears. However, he replied :
“Not—all yet. Why?”
“Well, I’m discharged.”
“By whose order? —no order has gone from
here !” Mr. Scribbins rose in all the wrath of an
offended official.
“ By yours, sir.”
Then No. 6006 explained. He concluded by
saying: “Fix up my discharge all right, Mr.
Scribbins, and you shall have the letter back.”
“ Devil take you,” cried the Chief Clerk. “I’ll
have you arrested as an escapee !”
“No you won’t,” rejoined our humourist, coolly.
“If I’m not at a certain place to-night, copies o’
that letter, with full particulars, will be on their
way to every ‘damned newspaper,’ Mr. Scribbins,
here, Launceston, Melbourne and Sydney.”
“ But,” said the Chief Clerk, “ I can’t do it!”
“By—Parson Ford, sir!” exclaimed No. 6006,
vehemently, “ you could do it for Slyde, and you
shall do it for me !”
* * *
The result of that conversation was that
Mr. Scribbins capitulated. He consented to “fix
up ” the little matter of No. 6006’s freedom.
Of course he got back his letter ? Well, to tell
the exact truth, he didn’t, Zedekiah seized an
opportunity of Mr. Scribbins being momentarily
called away to concoct another little joke. He
possessed himself of several sheets of officially-
headed notepaper from the latter’s stationery
cabinet.
By the aid of one of these sheets, No. 6006 was
enabled to present Mr. Scribbins with a forged
copy of his own letter.
And by the aid of the original, at a future date,
i he was enabled to build up the beginnings of that
substantial bank-balance, owing chiefly to which
he died “deeply regretted.”

ALLEN'S
Galvanic Battery
Is acknowledged by Eminent Physicians, and by
thousands of sufferers to be a positive Remedy for
nearly all the ailments mankind is heir to. The effi-
cacy of this Wonderful Invention as a curative agent
is certainly The Crowning Med'cal and Scien-
tific Triumph of the 19th Century.'
This BATTERY is not larger than a half-crown
piece, and is worn on the chest, next the skin, suspen-
ded by a silk cord around the neck. The several
metals of which it is composed are so arranged that the
natural humidity of the skin is sufficient to set the chem-
icals in the amalgamated metals in motion, generating
a constant but gentle flow of Electricity which passes
from the Battery into the system, purifying the Blood,
Strengthening the Nerves,jßrain and Muscles, infusing
fresh vigor into the Debilitated Constitution, Stimu-
lating the Vital Organs to their proper action and en-
abling nature to throw off numerous diseases.
The Battery will cure the following ailments: —
Headache, Rheumatism, Sciatica, Neuralgia, Dicers,
and Tumors, Nervous Debility, Impotence, Liver Com-
plaints, Fever and Ague, Disease of the Kidneys and
Drinal Organs, Bronchitus, Asthma, Diphtheria, Fits,
Constipation, Piles, Heart Disease, Paralysis, Disease
of the Lungs and Throat, Skin Disorders, and almost,
every form of Aches and Pains.
The Battery has a soothing effect upon children
While teething. Illustrated Circular sent free, giving
full particulars and directions for use,

tried them, and found the benefits which are ensured by
their use

of the liver, they act like “ MAGIC,” and a few doses will
be found to work wonders upon the most important
organs in the human machine. They strengthen the
whole muscular system, restore the long-lost complexion,
bring back the keen edge of appetite, and arouse into ac-
tion with the ROSEBUD of health the whole physical
energy of the human frame. These are “ FACTS ” tes ifled
continually by members of all classes of society ; and
one of the best guarantees to the nervous and debilitated
