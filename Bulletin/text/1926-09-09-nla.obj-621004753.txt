Nothing gives such relief in whooping
cough as Chamberlain’s Cough
Remedy. It liquifies the tough mucus,
makes expectoration easy, lessens the
straining of the cough and counteracts
any tendency towards pneumonia.

THE MOUTH THE GATEWAY for DISEASE.
Scientists have proved conclusively that no fewer
than 38 different infections may be traced to the
human mouth as a starting point. The mouth thus
being the gateway for the entrance of disease, it
is here that precautions are most necessary.
Hudson’s Eumenthol
Jujubes
Are the most powerful, safe and pleasant Germi-
cide and Antiseptic known. Beins- destructive to
all organisms which give rise to infectious diseases,
they keep the mouth in a sweet, healthy condition.
The Lancet (London) states: —“Their purpose is to
act as a bactericide" in the mouth. This result is
likely to be gained, for in the experiments tried
Eumenthol Jujubes proved to be as effective bac-
tericidally as is creosote.”

Has Kultur Ousted Culture?
Now that most of us are but slightly in-
terested in such post-war tidyings-up as
Germany’s disarmament and reparation re-
sponsibilities, new boundaries (including
Polish corridors), mandated territories, the
somersaulting mark and the tumbling franc
and (last, but not least) the lady-like League
of Nations, we might do worse than ask our-
selves, but not our neighbors, who won the
war. And by “the war” is not meant the orgy
of physical maiming and slaughter which
was let loosp on the world 12 short years
ago, for that was but the inevitable result
of antagonistic ideals which had been slowly
but surely coming to blows down the preced-
ing centuries.
The real war of rival ethics between the
Anglo-Saxon-Celtic group and the Nordic-
Teutonic one can be said to have started
with the birth of Henrik Ibsen in 1828. The
champions of the latter type of ethics had
not become definitely and differentially vocal
until then. A generation or so before, Byron
had assumed the role of enfant terrible, and
defied conventions common to both racial
stocks in the earlier halcyon days of Shaks-
peare and Goethe. His contemporary Shel-
ley, too, occasionally made our ancestors
gasp, but the effusions of these two “out-
laws” were intended more as playful shocks
than as purposeful propaganda. On the
English side of the Atlantic the first half
of the nineteenth century ushered in a mouth-
piece of conventional ethics in Alfred Tenny-
son, yvliile Longfellow tuned his lyre to liigh-
mindedness in the colony overseas. It can
be truthfully said that no Anglo-Saxon-
Celtic poet or prose-writer from 1800-50
questioned or seriously attacked the ethics
of home, church or State. Not that they
were blind to the many faults of their time,
but they were too high-minded to lend them-
selves to vandalistic iconoclasm. It remained
for the genius Ibsen to commence in this lialf-
ceutury a frontal attack on conventional
ethics. While lie. in able command of the
dramatic and poetic right wing, launched his
attack on “what’s simply not done,” his able
lieutenant Treitschke led his politico-histori-
cal battalions of diabolically clever prose
against entrenched world-opinion. And what
was the lesson that both of them taught?
This —that if circumstances in life do not
agree with one’s physical comfort, as deter-
mined by one’s personal temperament or self-
centred preference, then one should “kick or
kill” somebody. Their revolutionary ideals
failed to storm the Anglo-Saxon-Celtic cita-
dels held by Tennyson, Dickens, Thackeray
and Thomas Moore in the first half of the
nineteenth century. But the latter half of
that fruitful century saw the will-to-conquer
convention reinforced by Sudermann, Haupt-
mann and others, who inflicted a severe
reverse in this the real world war on Barrie,
a staunch loyalist of the old regime; Oscar
Wilde, a questionable dilettante; and a last-
hope Kipling, whose voice continued crying
ethically—albeit ultra-imperialistically—in
the wilderness.
With what result? Think of the popular
novels and dramas of the day (poetry was
lost in the crush of the mechanical age),
and of the works of Ibsen and those others
upon which so much of all modern literature
is modelled. With ‘ such teachings received
and followed, it is easy to explain the self-
seeking, the . injustice, the cruelty and the
beastliness of some of the physical warfare
begun in 1914, but, what is more to the
point, a certain weakened moral effect dis-
coverable in our own times, not only in
family relations, but in many others. These
teachings have more to do than most of us
suspect, not only with the number of modern
divorces, but with the flirtatious vanities
that precede them, including the guzzling,
the tippling, the gossiping, the dressing and
the undressing, the indecency of the dancing,
the vulgarity of the language, the emptying
of places in which serious problems of life
are discussed and the crowding of those that
exploit the frivolous and the flippant. The
question must be asked: Does the literature
of the day foster the mental, the rational
and spiritual nature, the higher ideals of
life, the fulfilment of which alone can bring
satisfaction to the individual or happiness
to the community? Why should intelligent
men, who should have enough vision to fore-
see the results of their own tainted influence,
join in an endeavor to lessen belief in those
higher ideals of what life can do and be?
How is it that when the devil of Nordic-
Teutonic Kultur wants to incarnate himself
he should so often find particularly favor-
able conditions among the Anglo-Saxon-
Celtic?
As on this evening of August. 1926, we
turn over the pages of one of the many—
too many—popular novels of the day, we
may well pause a moment and reflect not
irrelevantly on which side won the war.

Work and Literature
Lehrs ago, when fresh from the bush, a
man who has since become more or less
recognised in Australia and is not unknown
overseas was confronted with Lambert’s
“Across the Black-soil Plains.” which lie
then saw for the first time. “What is wrong
with it?” the, question was shot at him.
Without a moment’s hesitation he replied:
‘lt is not a team.” After a pause came
the query: “What’s right about it?” “As far
as I can see. pretty nearly everything but
that,” replied the bushman. “Would you
like to own it?” “I think not.” “Why?”
“It would annoy me. I would be for ever
wanting to make them pull together, to
teach them their work. It would give me
no satisfaction.”
Is not that just what is wrong with Aus-
tralian literature? It lacks unity—that
unity without which there is no real achieve-
ment. Most of our writers have tasted only
bottled Australia. Those who have drunk
from the draught are not writers. Few of
the latter can express themselves at all well
even in conversation. Hence it is that, while
we get some quite good localised effects, the
general effect is not convincing; there is no
continuity, no breadth. Henry Lawson’s
short stories stand high in their class. As
short stories they are admirable. As pictures
of Australian life they have never been
equalled within their own ambit. Individu-
ally they are excellent, but the total effect
is not good. They hold up the mirror to
life, but it is a mirror of uneven surface
contorting the pictures. Looked at as a
whole, they caricature Australian life to
almost as great a degree as do the broad,
rollicking sketches of Steele Rudd or the
tainted tale thrown oft' by Marcus Clarke.
One often hears it said that the greatest
Australian novel is “Geoffrey llamlyn.” Its
chief defect is that it is not Australian. It
was written by an Englishman who knew
little about this country. The faults in it,
though they may not strike the casual reader,
are essential. To take an Englishman and
forcibly hold him under a gum-tree while
lie eats his midday meal, or slap a pair of
spurs on to his heels and stick him on to
a horse, no more makes an Australian of
him than does equipping a townie with a
swag and a billycan and sending him on
the road make him a bushman. When an
Australian wanders along a hawthorn lane
or stands in rapture amongst Burnham
beeches in spring or autumn, he is not an
Englishman but an Australian, though in
his case there is some ancestral call at work
deep within him. For the Englishman in
Australia there is none of this. To him
the effects are altogether new and strange,
if not crude or bizarre. When we read books
produced in the British Isles, or even in other
civilised countries, we know the voice and
recognise the call. When other people read
our books, nothing is familiar to them except
the actual letters in which they read. That
is our difficulty with the world.
What is our difficulty with our own folk,
who should be our best readers but who are
not? Perhaps it is largely that they do
not know and understand their own country.
Possibly it is they who are at fault as
readers. More likely it is the winters who
are to blame. The greatest achievement in
art or literature is surely to obtain the
correct relativity, the general effect. While
this general effect does not require technical
knowledge—witness the work of Rudyard
Kipling—it unfailingly demands insight such
as can be secured only by sympathetic under-
standing. Sympathy alone will not achieve
it. Technical knowledge, however complete,
cannot control it. It is where the two are
found together that the happiest results arc
obtained. Perhaps, as we are so often re-
minded, we are yet too young to produce a
masterpiece. More likely our failure to do
so is owing to the fact that we not only all
work for a living, but actually take a pride
in doing so, whereas the true artist hates
working—especially working for a living.
W. M. FLEMING.
Literature in Schools
A writer in the English Review says
rather pessimistically that many years’ ex-
perience has forced him to the conclusion
“that the attempt to teach English literature
and to form literary taste on the lines now
and for a long time customary in our schools
is not only barren of good results, but pro-
ductive of almost irremediable evil in all
but exceptional cases.” He does not blame
the teacher, but says it is due to the “exigu-
ous mental and emotional experience” of the
schoolboy and to his limited “power of per-
spective.” To some extent it is possible to
join issue on these latter points.
The average schoolboy lias a very good
knowledge of human nature in its broad
phases, and is a very critical judge of it.
He understands most of the greater emo-
tions ; lie is very lucky indeed if he lias no
idea of suffering, grief, anger and jealousy.
He knows the meaning of action and lazi-
ness : and he may quite easily be acquiring
a glimmering of love, devotion and faith.
No doubt these more subtle feelings he will
have studied more by observation than by
experience, but they will have come within
his horizon. The capacity fbr experience
varies with boys as 'with everyone else;
many adults certainly have no definite or
consistent ideas or conclusions on these mat-
ters, or, if they have them, seem quite in-
capable of applying them to the judgment of
literature.
The results are interesting, and to persons
with no adult contact with education may
seem peculiar. When I first had to take
"King Lear” with a class. I faced the* pros-
pect with misgiving. But the pupils (aged
from 16 to 18) seemed to enjo.y it. They
naturally found it difficult, as they would
have found any of Shakspeare’s greater
plays, but it was worth the struggle. The
emotions depicted were such as they could
realise, though very likely they failed
to appreciate the gigantic scale of feeling on
which Shakspeare worked. Also it was pro-
bably the part, rather than the play as a
whole, that was most liked. The clear-cut
characters and the cunning contrast of them
were a great help. Above all, there was
always something happening. A second read-
ing showed that there was still an abundant
harvest of interesting points not fully
grasped at the first reading. The play did
not “wear thin”; on the contrary, further
acquaintance strengthened their admiration.
Not all literature will bear this test. “Enoch
Arden,” for example, becomes frankly a bore
to both teacher and pupil after one careful
reading. Its artifice and sentimentality, its
efforts at gentility, stand out glaringly,
though an exception must be made in favor
of the splendid description of the island.
“Hamlet” and “Macbeth” are also well
liked; “Coriolanus” seems somewhat dull,
being too political, but it improves on
acquaintance; “Julius Caesar” does not
appeal very much, perhaps through a lack
of passion of the familiar kind. “The Tem-
pest” also fails to attract; the air of it is
somewhat too ethereal and alien to ordinary
humanity. The comedies naturally are great
favorites, but “Richard II.” quite fails. The
artistic, neurotic temperament of Richard
is beyond young people, and wins no sym-
pathy at all.
The teaching of general literature is not
easy. It is, as a rule, done chronologically,

Essex proved that everyone wants a “Six.*’ But low price is not
the only reason why 300,000 owners are praising it so highly,
nor does price alone explain the reason for its continued sales
leadership.
Yet its price is the lowest in history. Time-proved qualities are
what owners talk about. They speak of the little attention Essex
requires and of how infrequent and small is the service cost. They
tell of economy in fuel, oil and tyres. And they praise Essex
smoothness in performance, its nimbleness and its power.
The motor is built under Super-Six patents that give a perform-
ance and quality exclusive to its famous
principle. It is the best Essex ever built, and
because of its vast production and the constant
development of economical and precision
methods of manufacturing it is priced lower
than ever before.
The cost is less than for most Fours and little
more than the lowest-priced car on the market.
Can you ignore such facts in the choice of
your car?

DAVID JONES’
from Beowulf to Kipling. The reverse order
might be better, starting with the compara-
tively familiar Stevenson, Dickens and
Tennyson, and working back to the stranger
and more difficult writers of earlier times.
Then, again, the chronological method im-
plies a vocabulary of literary discussion and
an insight into its methods that have yet to
be acquired. But the worst aspect of all
this is its lack of originality. The teachers
have gone from High School to University
and then back, perpetually learning other
people’s opinions, and these they pass on
to another generation of learners. The hand
of the professor weighs heavy. But where
the teacher has enthusiasm, reads widely
for himself and gives the youngsters his
honest first-hand opinions, the literature
course can become very pleasant and, I be-
lieve, profitable. It is not always easy to
be honest. One pupil, to whom I confessed
that I had no great fondness for Dickens,
was quite surprised. Apparently I should
have admired him ex officio.
The perpetual circulation of critical
opinions is a sorry substitute for reading of
the originals. Some boys become very expert
at it and write astonishingly good essays.
But could not something of a more active
and original kind be invented? It might be
difficult, but is very desirable. As an alter-
native to an essay on sonnets, would not an
original sonnet do? Perhaps the remedy
would be worse than the disease. Finally,
it may be mentioned that Australian verse
is represented reasonably among the books
studied, but scarcely ever any Australian
prose. Have we no respectable prose suit-
able for study in school?
COLUMRUS.
“Appassionata”
We like to think that there is nothing
that the art of letters cannot express. In
nearly every fine shade of thought I suppose
we are justified in our belief; in some
language all these ideas are in words. The very
delicate ideas naturally take longer than the
others to get into print, particularly those
that seem to overflow from the domain of
pure letters into some other domain, such
as medicine or religion. The reason is obvi-
ous ; the more the propaganda value of
“Damaged Goods” and “The Lamplighter,”
the less their literary value.
But Letters does not lose heart. She
believes that some time some writer will
put the scourge of syphilis on his paper, not
as Dr. Brieux’s roaring plague wiping out
the souls of his spineless characters (neces-
sarily spineless because of the dominating
medical theme), but as an everyday idea of
courage and faith and work, like tubercu-
losis and cancer. She believes that some
writer some day will be an epic religious
writer with a clear view of the spirit correl-
ated justly with the world, the flesh and
the Devil. She has her evidence that the
day is drawing near. The mystics and the
mystic poets gave her the beauty of the
religious life, and that was half the battle;
the mystics corralled a good many potential
saints and made a number of shadowy
beautiful things clear to them. J. H.
Shorthouse, in his exquisite “John Ingle-
sant,” did a like service to a good
many sinners; his story of Inglesant’s voca-
tion and rejection of the world is one of
the most moving, convincing pictures in our
tongue. For me it made the one occasion of
the idea of religious vocation getting into
my mind ; before I read the book the voca-
tion was a mystery, a saint’s mystery, to
me. I know now that Shorthouse forced
his idea into my mind on the edge of as
narrow a thesis as Saint Teresa’s: the sump-
tuous charm of his Tudor setting, all the dim
music and superstition, the gorgeousness, pre-
supposed that beauty and all men are
sinful; which, despite the Psalmist, is surely
as false as the belief that all men want to
be saints.
“John Inglesant” did not much more, then,
than the recording or buttoning-up of the fact
that the battle was half won or wholly won,
if you like, so far as the saints and sinners
were concerned. There remains the bulk of
ordinary mankind, for whose imaginative
service literature came into existence. No-
body big enough to tackle this important
majority on the subject of the religious life
was found to put pen to paper until this
year.
Fannie Hurst was born 37 years ago in
Ohio. Her early work, a number of Jewish
short stories, for the most part poor and
over-emphasised, loose and repetitive, gave
no indication of the possibility of last year's
“Lummox,” a magnificently simple and
reticent study of the heart of a servant-girl.
“Lummox” is an example of great art, its
content comparable only with Hardy or
E. M. Forster in our generation. That is
much to say, I know; but it is not as much
as can be said of Appassionato, (Cape), this
year’s book. “Lummox” is an epic of the
bodily earth, of temporal things like food
and comfort and kindliness. “Appassionato”
is an epic of the soul; of the ecstatic free-
doms and imprisonments of the soul; the
comfortless, wondrous places where only the
soul and God can satisfy each other. That
seems altogether too much to say, of course,
in speaking of a modern novel by a popular
American author ; but let me try to explain.
The whole action of this story takes place
in the mind of Laura Regan, who lives in
New York, is a beauty (a “white beauty”),
and is engaged to be married to a virile young
man on the Stock Exchange. The family
is rich, but only in Laura’s generation what
is known as cultivated. Old Regan is a
Catholic Ulster peasant who has -built up
his fortune in America. He is still very
careful of the spending of the fortune, which
gives the effect of the self-denial practised
in the Catholic home. Mrs. Regan and
Laura have the stainless indomitable faith
of the vital Catholic; they have the softness
of the Irish, all the cuddling little pieties,
all the sweet kindliness. Old Regan is the
Red Hand, dour and strong and simple. Their
life is the ordinary life of the middle-class
American family.
We follow Laura’s thoughts through her
ordinary adventures of dancing and motor-
ing with her fiance, trying to tackle the
family discomforts caused by her father, try-
ing to make things easy for her crushed and
spiritless mother, her broken-hearted sister
and her rebellious brother. First, we notice
that pity—a shy, unworldly pity—is one of
her qualities. We carry on with her thoughts
wdien she is dressing to meet her fiance, pre-
paring her trousseau, in her bath, having
one whisky-and-soda too many at a party,
being kissed by her vibrant young man. She
is an average young woman, and she likes
all these things; but we see that every now
and again her thoughts slip out to some place
of their own, a quiet place under the closed
eyes of the Max Christus in her room, and
that she is content in the comfortless
quietude. Her beauty and the vital young
man, the charming underclothes, the “lyre
of her body”—all the ordinary springtime
things—are calling her to her destiny. She
likes them, even at times revels in them;
but they are not vivid to her. She goes to
confession : why is she not reaching out with
greedy hands to give herself to Dudley and
take all these raptures to her heart? Is she
going to fail as a wife? The priest has only
rhythmic generalities and platitudes to offer;
there is no real answer for her virgin per-
plexities.
On the eve of her wedding a motor acci-
dent breaks her shoulder. When she recovers
a trauma prevents her from walking; for
months she lies inert, until Dudley gets fed
up and is released. That night the eyes of
the Christus open; and she walks. She
decides upon the veil; a great tide of
spiritual happiness sweeps down upon her,
all these futile raptures may fall away now.
The Regans are up in arms; the deadly
silent pressure of the united Catholic family
comes into action —crushed mother, ageing
father, broken-hearted sister. rebellious
brother; and she deserting them! But she
carries on. The world has its last potent
shot in the shape of a Pan-like young man.
all poetry and laughing sex. all enchantment
to a Celt. The sanctuary vanishes; she will
follow this young man. She is packing hys-
terically. reaching up too far for frocks in
the closet; and the trauma intervenes again.
Her knees are locked; she cannot walk.
Stunned, she sees the eyes of the Christus
are closed upon her. She cries out that He
open them, that she may walk for Him. Her
knees are released from the passing trauma;
and she walks, towards Him.
I know’ now what the religious vocation
is, rising in the average mind. Not in the
mind of the saint, nor in that of a Tudor

HILARY LOFTING.
Sassoon’s Satire
Thin stuff indeed is Siegfried Sassoon’s
Satirical Poems (Heinemann). His shafts
are aimed at the obvious; the titled class in
England offers easy opportunity for cheap
gibes. Any second-grade poet could turn out
this sort of thing if he thought it worth
while:—
Ebullitions of Empire exulted. I listened and stared.
Patriotic paradings with pygmy preciseness went by.
The band bashed out bandmaster music; the trum-
peters blared.
The Press was collecting its cliches....
The magnaphone-microphone-magnified voice of the
King
Spoke hollow and careful from vacant remoteness of
air.
I heard. There was no doubt at all that the Sovereign
was there;
He was there to be grave and august and to say the
right thing ;
To utter the aims of Dominion. He came to declare
An inaugurate Wembley. He did....
Satire should be short and sharp, a swift
pin-prick in the balloon of pomposity; but
Sassoon’s gibes are too laboriously and elabo-
rately fabricated. His subjects are such
stale things as the National Gallery, the
London Museum, the Tate Gallery, West-
minster Abbey. As this dull, cheap, perky
satirist “fumbles for his notebook,” we can
only echo his most masterly line: —
Enough, enough, enough, enough, enough!

The Failing Eyesight of H. G. Wells
With astounding prodigality 11. G. Wells
has published nearly 60 books within the
last 80 years, and is now paying the penalty
imposed upon those writers who persist in
exceeding the speed limit. At the outset of
his career his splendid vision swept the
interstellar spaces and observed the inhabi-
tants of the moon, and, focusing down the
corridors of time, watched the death agonies
of this planet; now he can see no further
than the next decade. His vision is dim.
The eyes of his mind are presbyopic.
There was always something of the show-
man and conjurer in Wells. He possessed
an illimitable fertility of mind and con-
siderable intellectual adroitness. He had
cards up his sleeve; and, when required,
could always be relied upon to produce the
white rabbit of generalisation from the top-
hat of speculation. It has been stated that
he is like a man running to keep pace with
his own thoughts. At the zenith of his
powers he composed rapidly, and sometimes
flawlessly; but now the signs of immoderate
haste are upon all that he writes.
Intellectually he is a chameleon, and can
change his opinions as quickly as he can
change his clothes. But life leaves him
little time for reflection. He writes to-day
about the things of \yhich he first heard
yesterday, often mistaking the ill-considered
utterances of a politician for the balanced
wisdom of a philosopher. Some years ago,
as the result of previous correspondence, my
father sent him a batch of papers dealing
with Townplanning and Municipal Govern-
ment in Australia. The reply is character-
istic. It is scrawled on the back of a penny
post-card, dated Washington, December 5,
1921: “Thanks for letter. Too busy to
answer it properly. Friendly greetings. H. G.
Wells.” At that moment he was contribu-
ting superior journalism to the New’ York
World and the Chicago Tribune, and pitch-
ing together material for his “Washington
and the Hope of Peace.”
It was Mencken, of the Smart Set, I
think, who first drew’ attention to the wan-
ing of Wells, shortly after the latter had
set up “God, the Invisible King,” in the
empty fane of his Fabian intellect. Cer-
tainly none of his later books come into the
front ranks of literature, although many
contain passages of rare charm, verbal magic,
with a dash here and there, among slovenly
sentences and portentous prophecies, of the
old Wellsian brilliance. In these patch-
work productions, done against time, the
old Utopian dreams come up again ; familiar
ideas occur in different dress; the data of
world orderliness, universal brotherhood, ex-
tended education, etc., crop up in succeeding
books like cards after each re-shuffle.
In “Chi'istina Alberta’s Father” a few
fresh ingredients are stirred into the old
recipe. Wells voices his discontents and his
dissatisfaction with the present social order
through the mouthpiece of a retired laundry-
man who becomes a fanatic. The earlier
chapters, describing the suburban atmo-
sphere of the laundry and the pseudo-
boliemianism of Chelsea, are perfect examples
of his former artistry. But the remainder
of the book is banal; and in it Wells exposes
the failure of his eyesight. He exhibits igno-
rance. lie turns his laundryman into that
rarest type of lunatic, the exalted paranoic,
who imagines himself Sargon, king of kings.
The picture, presented with all the pretended
trappings of reality, is clinically untrue. His
portrayal of the lunatic’s arrest and committal
to a mental hospital at .Cumerdown Hill,
where he is bullied into silence in an institu-
tion with other inmates, treated chiefly with
copious doses of croton oil by a medical
superintendent who hovers about “nebu-
lously” in the background, shows a complete
lack of knowledge regarding modern psychi-
atric methods, and a lack of insight into the
principles of psycho-therapy. Wells’s treat-
ment of this section of the story is 50 years
out of date, and might well refer to the.
time when asylum doctors were looked upon
as keepers of “mad houses,” and the attend-
ants were drawn from the ranks of the ex-
convicts.
Wells has failed completely to understand
the modern psychiatric point of view, edu-
cated medical opinion and the reforms of the
British Lunacy Commission; and he writes
still as if lunacy was an open shame to the
patient and his people, fostering the time-
worn idea of the insane stigma instead of
endeavoring to dispel from popular imagi-
nation the unsavory delusions which cling
to the word lunatic. I take this as one
glaring instance of his failing vision, and
part of the penalty he must inevitably pay
for the terrific speed at which he works. For
surely a man of such nimble mind, who can
write the history of the, world in fortnightly
parts, invent a new god, set out a schedule
for the salvaging of civilisation and then
draw up a new programme for the planet,
should be better informed about modern
psychiatry—a subject which, though of long-
delayed growth, now stands, by reason of its
far-reaching effects, at the forefront of
modern medicine. Should he ever take steps
to rectify his failing eyesight, one can
imagine his chagrin when he discovers that
for some years he has been sharing popular
prejudices.

A Satchel of Books
Sword Play, by Charles B. Stilson (Howard Watt).
The author has written some clever novels —“The
Ace of Blades,” “A Cavalier of Navarre” and others
of the derring-do school —in which the flash of swords
and the smiles of fair ladies are inextricable. This
new novel weaves its pattern of primary colors out
of the France of the seventeenth century, with a
background of the neutral-tinted hills of Scotland.
A good romance of its dashing' and don’t-1 hink-too-
long-about-it kind.
The Dark Places, by Percival Gibbon (Methuen).
The author can tell a good yarn, and in this volume
of stories gives a seeming veracity to matters which
would call for corroborative evidence in a court of
justice. Cleverly conceived and well written.
The Rose-lit Street, by Rosamund Nugent (Ilarrap).
“There is a street, rose-lighted by Hope, crazy-
paven with dreams. The name of the street is Life,
but to Youth it is known as Romance.” Along this
street, through many capitals, the author leads the
feet of Rachel Tristram, a beautiful young actress,
to the door of matrimony. Just what you'd expect
it to be from the foregoing.
The Memoirs of Raymond Poincare, translated and
adapted by Sir George Arthur (Heinemann). The
recall of Poincare to office as in popular opinion the
one statesman in France capable of meeting its
financial crisis gives interest to this work. The
present volume covers the year 1912, and succeeding
volumes will carry readers over the period of the
statesman’s Presidency immediately before and during
the war, and his term as Premier following it. Poin-
care’s record of 1912 throws a strong light on the
fear in the heart of France for its safety, in view
of the increasing menace of Germany’s army and
newly created navy, in contrast with the complais-
ance with which John Bull viewed the situation.
There was an almost feverish anxiety shown on the
part of France to link England closer to her by
strengthening the nebulous entente, and if possible
transforming it into the more material links of a
treaty. On the other hand, we saw England declining
to be drawn in lest any -such act might bear the
appearance of a definite hostility towards Germany.
The diplomatic underplay is frankly exposed. If
the Kaiser made a move calculated to draw England
closer to the fatherland, news of it at once travelled
to France by the unofficial route of diplomacy.
“England, of course,” remarks Poincare, “wishes to
remain friendly to Germany,” but “should a trial
of strength be forced on us, England, we knew, would
not stand aloof, but would lend her puissance to
the weaker side which was in arms to defend the
rights of Europe.” Woven into the pages of these
interesting memoirs is a- tissue of nervous apprehen-
sion of what the great war-lords of Prussia were
contemplating.
—
“Bibliopole”: Mr. O’Farrell, in his list of Boys’
Books (R.P. 19/8/’2G), awards points to two authors
for things they didn’t write. He credits Ballantyne
with W. H. G. Kingston’s “Peter the Whaler.”
This work was so successful that its author decided
to give up business and devote himself to this class
of literature, of which, during 30 years, he wrote
130, including the very popular “Three Midshipmen.”
Mr. O’Farrell next confuses the brothers Kingsley.
The Rev. Charles, who was never in Australia, wrote
“Westward Ho!” “The Water Babies” and “The
Heroes,” while “Geoffrey Hamlyn” was the outcome
of his brother Henry’s experiences on Australian
goldfields and as a member of the Mounted Police.
“Two Seas”: If I may butt into the “sheer hulk"
argument (B. 19/8/’26), I think “Yamawa” is correct.
“Ancient Mariner,” relying upon dictionaries, main-
tains that the term “sheer hulk” applies only to a
hulk equipped -with shear-legs, and thereby betrays
a sad lack of poetic imagination. When Dibdin
wrote “Here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling.”
sailormen understood him to mean that Tom had been
deprived of all his motive power, like a wind-jammer
that had been dismantled of all her sails and rigging.
Shear-legs have nothing to do with the case. A
vessel’s sheer means her lines —that is, the graceful
curve running from stem to stern. Hence, a sheer
hulk had nothing left standing above her t’gallnnf
rail —not even shear-legs. “Ancient Mariner” appears
to have confused “sheer” with “shears.” “Sheer
hulk” was good nautical English for a defunct shell-
back when I was at sea in the late ’seventies.

A stock model Studebaker Big Six recently crossed the American
continent from New York to San Francisco in 86 hours and 20
minutes —distance of 3471 miles (5785 kilometers) averaging 40.2
miles (67 kilometers) per hour.
In spite of the severe storms and bad road conditions encoun-
tered, the time was 16 hours, 25 minutes, faster than the best pre-
vious automobile record, and 6 hours, 25 minutes, faster than the
distance can be traversed over smooth rails by the swiftest trains.
THIS Studebaker triumph is im-
portant to car owners every-
where. Though you will probably
never require such gruelling service
from your car, this test proves the
extent of those built-in qualities of
endurance which make the Stude-
baker so reliable in everyday use.
Super - endurance is one of the
reasons why the Studebaker Big Six
is the fastest-selling high-powered
car in the world. To pay less than a
Studebaker costs is false economy; to
pay more is needless extravagance.

Speedy and Economical
In almost any business there is a large amount of detail figuring,
requiring only a quick and accurate answer with no printed record. For
example, there is the checking of incoming and outgoing invoices, figuring
of wage sheets, calculating interest and foreign exchange. -For work ox
this type there is no machine as suitable as the Burroughs Calculator.
It is speedy—it adds, multiplies, subtracts or divides and gives the
correct answer, in less time than it takes merely to write the figures with
a pencil. This is possible because of its smooth, easy keyboard action.
It is economical—its initial cost is low. Its operating cost is less than
the expense involved in using a lead pencil. It will last for years. Then
the machine is light and portable, so that it may be carried to any place
where it is needed for use. These facts make the Burroughs Calculator
the choice of business men everywhere.
By having a demonstration of the Burroughs Calculator on your own
work you will appreciate the saving of time and money made possible by
this machine. For more information just call or write our nearest office.

My lonely world, into whose vast recesses
No one intrudes, not even love; I pace
Its ways alone, from lifeless place to place.
Sole, I walk forth, its wind in my loose
tresses;
No friend here meets me with divine caresses ;
All, all is barren waste. And I, who face
The void, see nought but relics of a race
Forgotten, while the sun a new world blesses.
Yet on the borders of my world so lone
There is another world too bright for.

But that my noontide faltered, waveringly.
Life had not known the mercy of Ilis tears

Swept mine with torrent force where

Nor met with clear-eyed Peace, unless our

Had won for me the right to call you

I had not viewed Life's many facets, cut
By circumstance as turns the wheel of

Had it not lifted me from out the rut
Of petty things, to wider hopes—and

Nor the true diamond from glitt’ring paste,
Had not your eyes their tenderness of old
Shed over all the surging years laid waste!

Had not the ache of toiling feet been mine:
Nor that the salt from tears Love could

And turn their bitterness to sweet, still

Homeward.
And now we shall go homeward
Over the long, green seas,
To the lone land of our dreaming,
Far from the ways of ease,
Far from the strange Dark People
And the sighing almond-trees.
Ay! this has been my longing
Through the warm, sunlit years;
While days have sped with laughter
I have given my secret tears
To the land of the pale sunlight—
My hopes and anguished fears.
I have looked to the wide heavens
When the stars were clear and white,
Within my heart wild envy
Of the moon at her proud height
That she should touch oie °rey land
With a long sword of light.
I have watched tall ships go seaward
U pon still nights of stars;
Their high sails billowed wliitely.
With moonrays on their spars,
And wept to know them seeking
The grey land’s harbor bars.
And now we shall go homeward
To the town by the far sea,
Where the bells will ring us welcome
With a flood of melody ;
And we shall live oil a hillside
Beside a laurel-tree.
And I wonder if, as the seas roll
Through long and tranquil hours,
I shall long for the dim pathways
By the glowing orange bowers V
For the songs of the Dark People,
And the scent of almond flowers?

FLYING PRESIDENTS AND CAPTIVE
KINGS.
The downfall of Greece’s self-appointed Pre-
sident or Dictator was decorated by at least
one unusual feature. When Pangalos fled
he took his prison with him, like a snail bolt-
ing from its enemies carrying its shell on its
back. His gaol not being fast enough, or
possibly being short of coal, lie had a very
short run. He was the second head of a
republic which is not yet three years old:
it has so failed to take root that there is talk
already of restoring the Royal family,
though it was passed out in 1924 by a
referendum at which nearly a million
votes were counted and the republican majo-
rity was about 7 to 3. The monarchy hadn’t
made a brilliant success in the way of taking
root either; still, it ran to a pair of dynas-
ties, one consisting of a deaf Bavarian who
lasted 29 years, while the second extended
to four reigns and spread over 60 years.
That is to say, one wise king lasted 50 years,
and four inferior ones did the other 10. Still
that dynasty was the most durable-looking
governing institution of its very own which
Greece has possessed since about 333 8.C.,
and the interval might be described, without
undue recklessness, as a dashed long time.
At present an unusually large section of
the globe is trying to plant fresh Govern-
ments, or is being experimentally planted
with them, and the results are poor or in-
definite. Perhaps man never knew so much
about tidy self-government as was sup-
posed, or possibly he has forgotten something.
The attempt to make new dynasties out of
raw material is difficult. In Sweden the
Bernadottes look like taking hold, and else-
where the Karageorgevitches show some
gleams of permanence. But the rival House
of Obkenovitch is dead; and the Bona-
partes took no vigorous grip of the soil. The
attempt to make a durable independent mon-
arch out of llusein of Hedjaz also failed
badly; the staying capacity of bis son
Fizzle as King of Mesopotamia is doubted;
and the new Persian dynasty, which came
to the throne while the last ruler of a degen-
erate family was away at the mces, is very
much on trial, though the bright, fresh Par-
liament has made the crown of Darius
hereditary in his family, which sounds .hope-
ful. It is a very old crown if it can be
found, but it hasn’t been seen about much
lately. As for the new republics, they can
hardly be classed as Al. In Turkey Iyemal
is President by Parliamentary election, his
friends counting the vote; but in the case of
two big recent hangings of politicians alleged
to be critical of him and his ways, the rope
broke or slipped twice, and each time a poli-
tician had to be hanged over again. That
doesn’t sound like efficiency. Great hopes
are entertained that Iyemal may declare
himself Sultan, and furnish the world with
some pleasing novelty. China is alleged to
consist of two principal republican Govern-
ments, one at Pekin, of which little can be
learned, and one at Canton, which appears
to be bossed by river pirates. There is
also an indefinite supply of internal wars.
Russia is a land of secrets and monstrous
shadows, where dictators come and go with-
out the slightest coherent explanation, and
where there is compulsory military service,
and ghosts scuffling aronud in fogs. It is
the oldest of the new republics, and seems
to get nowhere. Portugal is in a state of
constant flux. Poland lias just been saved
from something or other by Pilsudski, who
lias become dictator by bis own appointment.
Italy and Spain try to keep out of the welter,
but in each place the king has a sort of
over-king, who is also a subject, in addition
to the regular or irregular Parliamentary in-
stitutions. If the boss-king discharged the,
subject-king it is not certain what would
follow.
* * * *
Thus the world is unusually busy sowing
the seed of institutions which don’t come up,
or else come up as something quit*; different
from the name in the seedsman’s catalogue.
There are real republics, where tine President
always arrives by election, and the election
is fairly honest or not too noticeably dis-
honest. Of these three are known with rea-
sonable certainty (three to a globe!), and
concerning one or two others which haven’t
had time to build a first-class reputation
hopes are entertained. There are nearly real
or half-real republics, and siome of them
appear to be improving. As for bogus or
nearly-bogus republics, they air many. The
weakness of flic wholly bogus republic is
that, as every adult citizen has the same
right to be President as tin; President him-
self, there is a tendency on the part of every
adult and ambitious citizen to hate the Pre-
sident, and on the part of the President to
feel that he would be safer if every adult
ambitious citizen was hanged. Wherefore
he is apt to go KEMAL-ing or LENiN-ing in
self-defence. As a general thing the best
ruler is the one elected by the people, if lie
is really elected by the people and not; by
a handful of “uncouth crooks’’ who profess
to be the people. Without that election an
hereditary monarchy, even one where the
monarch has rather too much power, is likely
to be an improvement, especially if the
monarchy has been hereditary long enough
fo become a fixed habit. George V. is sup-
posed to he pretty well fixed; he, can trace
his pedigree back to Egbert, who ruled Eng-
land in 829, and Egbert traced back to
Cerpic, who ruled part of England as early
as 500. To whom iCerdic traced back is un-
certain —and possibly isn’t of much real
consequence.
* -» * •*
It is curious to reflect that England once
had a sporting chance to become another
Gi-eece or Poland or Mexico. That was
when the standing army ruled, or its com-
mander did, and Parliament was either
chased bodily off the premises or the Opposi-
tion was chased off, and when the land was
parcelled out into military satrapies. When
the Cromwells passed outrun nor generals
Mere quite ready to be Pangalos or Iyemal:
only the right Pangalos didn't arrive in
time, and the prospect of the nation settling
down to the enjoyment of a little quiet chaos
was spoiled by the Restoration, Ireland,
however, supplied all the mixed political con-
ditions that could be asked for, ahd iu con-
sequence the luckless land was generally
short of friends. In the brave days of old
the king who wanted to strengthen himself
liked to give his beautiful and virtuous
daughter in marriage to the crown prince of
an adjacent State —preferably one with a
robust feudal army or the means to supply
a handy force of mercenaries. But an Irish
high-king, when lie existed in more than
name, was apt to be a small chief who had
climbed the way a Mexican ruler does, and
he had no feudal army, though lie might have
bards in plenty, and his son seldom succeeded
him. The latter was more likely to revert
to his father’s original status, which might
be little more than that of a squire, in which
case his wife presumably had the cows on
her mind. Therefore, a Capet or a lloiien-
staufen had much the same indifference
about having a King of Ireland for a son-
in-law as about having a President of Mexico
—not that any Mexican President ever
raised the question with a Capet or a
Hohenstaufen. Even the great Brian
Boroihme climbed by force, being aided
against his sovereign at one time by his
country’s enemies, the Danes, whom he after-
wards licked in many battles. Then failing,
despite his fame, to found a dynasty, he was
succeeded by his predecessor, which was un-
usual and picturesque. In the end the royal
office simply left off, and if any of the Eng-
lish sovereigns who followed Henry 11. ever
thought of doing the reasonable thing by
their Irish vassal-king they couldn’t find
him, nor even a pretender who had a fairly
legal claim to be him. Their Scottish vassal-
king could always be found —often in a bad
temper. In fact, the race came to England
at last, and became a nuisance.
* * *
The moral, if there is a moral, is that
the successful running of a country is a com-
plicated business, and that small-bore adven-
turers of the Pangalos calibre are well
advised to keep out of it.
WHERE GERRYMANDER IS KING.
The Queensland press dropped the subject
of the recent State election when it was clear
that there would be no change in the Parlia-
mentary situation, Political Labor being sure
of its customary 43 Assembly seats and the
Nat.-Cockies of their 29, and did not bother
about returns which drifted in during three
or four subsequent weeks. So nobody con-
tradicted Attorney-General Mullan when
he proudly announced that, in addition to get-
ting its usual thumping majority of seats, his
party had contrived to poll a majority of
votes. The complete figures were first pub-
lished in a Parliamentary paper which was
laid on the table last month. They do not
support Mullan’s assertion. On the con-
trary, they reveal that his crowd was in its
usual minority in the constituencies and was
indebted for its sweeping victory to the mas-
terly distribution of seats.
The parties fought each other in 63 elec-
torates, of which Labor won 37, as shown
hereunder. The unimportant Independent
vote is credited to Ministry or Opposition
according as candidates of this description
declared themselves pro- or anti-Labor: —

The worthy Mullan sits for Flinders, and
may therefore be regarded as one of the tri-
umphs of the electoral system over which he
presides. While 1342 Labor voters get a mem-
ber of their own way of thinking in Flinders,
2794 Nat.-Cocky voters are denied the same
privilege in Eaeham and 3099 in Kennedy,
though all three are North Queensland elec-
torates.
* * * *
In effect, 122,427 Labor voters returned 37
members, an average (omitting decimals) of
3308. But it took 105,342 Nat.-Cocky voters
to return the 26 Oppositionists, the average

A simple sum in addition shows that Labor
polled 187.125 votes in the 63 electorates and
the other side 190,060. Yet that minority of
votes in the electorate gave tin; Continuous
crowd a majority of two in the House!
The Opposition did not endorse Grant
Hervey, who opposed Mines Minister .Tones
in Paddington (7590 electors), nor did Labor
run candidates in the Nat.-Cocky strongholds
of Toombul (8023 electors) and Fassifern
(7100). On the last occasions when there
were party contests in these constituencies
the enrolment and voting were: —

Fassifern .. .. 5,268 1,534 3.123
Totals .. .. 19,696 7,220 9,203
Thus the party in office is 10 seats to the
good in contested electorates, and has an
absolute majority of four in the House,
although it is quite 5000 votes to the
bad. And its majority of four in the House
was increased to 14 by unopposed returns,
five Laborites being elected without a contest
in Gregory (3905 electors), Burke (4274),
Warrego (4941), Mitchell (4972) and Bs~
coo (5876), and a Nat.-Cocky in Cooroora
(8326). The Labor vote in Cooroora is so
small that it is many years since a party
nominee ventured there; the Nat.-Cocky vote
exceeds it by 3000 at least. Past contests
in the Labor pocket-boroughs showed the
following particulars
Opposi-
Electors. Labor. tion.
Gregory . . .. 5,192 2,014 1,000
Burke . . .. . . 5,274 1,943 1,235

Barcoo 5,270 2,628 1,105
Totals .. .. 26,987 11,262 5,581
A repetition of these figures in May wouldn’t
lijive converted the Labor minority of votes
into a majority (though Mullan has sug-
gested it would), but there could have been
no repetition anyhow. For, while Cooroora
gained 618 electors between 1923 and 1926,
and Barcoo 333, Gregory lost 1287, Burke
1000, Mitchell 763 and Warrego 575. At
the same time Flinders lost 1197. Brisbane
1183, Mount Morgan 897, Leichhardt 744,
Charters Towers 629, Rockhampton 575,
Queenton 412 and South Brisbane 373. These
shrinkages, and others, are recorded by
Mullan’s department; but even the reduced
totals seem wildly exaggerated. Though vot-
ing is compulsory at both Federal and State
elections, and the franchise is the same, the
percentage of voters in State electorates
which are doubtfully entitled to members
never gets near the percentage that was
recorded last November in Federal elec-
torates many times more populous. By the
same token, there were 440,851 names on the
Federal and 484,302 on the State rolls, and
there was a difference of 70,159 names in
1922. All this points to heroic roll-stuffing
in certain constituencies, especially where re-
distribution of seats was in sight; and it is
time the matter was considered frankly and
honestly. The Labor movement may be so
important that its supporters may be justified
in doing anything at all to win victories for
it. But in that case let us drop the hypo-
crisy of pretending that Labor government is
democratic government.
IRRIGATION IN JAVA.
“Mr. A. J. Byrne, stockbroker, of Melbourne,
who has just returned from a round trip to Malaya,
said that he was convinced that the Australian
Government should send a commissioner to Java to
learn about irrigation. Java is a veritable garden
from one end to the other as the result of the
attention paid to irrigation.”
The gentleman who deals in stocks and shares
marvelled at Java’s system of irrigation.
Who that has seen it hasn’t marvelled at it?
Yet one must have lived for some years in
the country fully to realise the marvel that
it is. One must have stood 9000 feet abovd
the sea, where the eye can sweep on the right
hand the blue Indian Ocean and on the left the
white waters of the Java Sea. Within one’s
view are half a dozen volcanoes busily active,
as they have been for thousands of years, in
refertilising the soil of an island which is
little bigger than Tasmania and which yet
supports over 35 million human ants.
Every mountain top-—and there are scores
of others out of sight—has its blanket of
perpetual cloud, and on every side are tor-
rente leaping downwards to the sea.
Before the Hindu came the Javanese knew
as little about irrigation as any Melbourne
stockbroker. The Hindu had some rudimen
tary knowledge of the subject, and had
applied it with sqme success where conditions
were entirely favorable. He taught his
simple art to the Javanese. It consisted of
terracing the hills in such a way that each
successive level was a little lower than the
last. He dammed the smaller streams and
led their waters by canals or bamboo pipes
into the first terrace; and when it filled the
water overflowed into the next terrace and
so onward, sometimes for scores of miles,
until it reached the sea. As the centuries
rolled by the indigene was able to extend
this empiric system bit by bit until every bau
of sloping country was dyked and planted
with rice, his staple food. His feeble dykes
were easy prey for floods; the mentek or rice
mildew sometimes failed to disappear in the
face of his spells and incantations; and his
gods occasionally gave the wrong answer
when asked to name the date for planting
out. Nevertheless, he persevered, and Java
from one end to the other became a garden,
as the stockbroker has observed. One day
the countryside is a drab monotony of muddy
fields. A couple of days later it is a flashing
mirror of a million panes, extending as far
as eye can reach, into every fold of the hills,
out on to every rugged spur, clinging as if
enchanted to sheer precipices. The next day
it is drab mud again, as the fields are drained
in accordance with the rice-plant’s needs.
Soon it acquires a tender green which deep-
ens through every emerald tone until it
turns a universal gold when harvest time
comes round. These changes go on from
year Jo year without regal’d to droughts, and
viewed from Mars must have all the appear-
ance of a miracle achieved by a race of demi-
gods instead of a horde of semi-naked coolies.
When the Dutchman came he replaced the
mud dams with reinforced concrete, and con-
sulted the meteorological tables instead of
the witch-doctor, thus increasing the yield
considerably; but in essence the system re-
mains what it was 800 years ago. It is
essentially a village industry. Women and
children for less than 12s. a month plant
out the countless seedlings singly, by hand.
By hand the crop is cut, with a tiny knife
that can be hid in the hand so that the rice-
soul will not be frightened off and next
year’s seed refuse to germinate. On human
backs the sheaves are carried to the thresh-
ing-shed, which is innocent of anything so
exotic as machinery. In this lush land
where labor is so cheap that a white clerk
may employ a native to keep the flies off
him, the results of all this industry and this
overflowing of Nature’s bounty, when divided
round, would surprise an Australian farmer.
Nobody but a few Europeans, Chinese and
Arabs earns more than two meals a day.
a bamboo shed to sleep in, two cotton sarongs
a year to clothe his nakedness, and for en-
tertainment a place at a funeral feast or a
circumcision ceremony. Despite the fact that
the irrigated field, 'without fertilising, can
grow three crops a year, and in the off season
is used for breeding fish, the Javanese con-


sumes less than £ls a year. And despite
the fact that the Javanese has been irrigat-
ing rice for centuries, when the experimental
farm at Yanco (N.S.W.) tried its hand at
the same art, it obtained an immensely larger
yield at the very first attempt.
In Java —the Java which has been
changed to a garden—l have read of the irri-
gation works of Australia; and the Javanese
has been asked to wonder at the amazing
things done and the more amazing things
proposed. One scheme named was that which
is being carried out under the River Murray
Waters Act, and in which the Governments
of the Commonwealth, N. S. Wales, Victoria
and S. Australia are concerned. Storages
are to be made on the Upper River Murray
and at Lake Victoria, and locks and weirs
are to be scattered from the mouth of the
river to Echuca and along the Darling and
Murrumbidgee. The scheme will probably
cost £10,000,000. The Hume Reservoir, to
hold 1,100,000 acre-feet, is another project.
Victoria has for many years been engaged on
schemes on its own account, and the area
it irrigates has increased in 15 years from
88,922 to 234,462 acres. At the moment it
is engaged in damming the Upper Goulburn
River, and this reservoir when it is com-
pleted will hold 306,000 acre-feet.
None of these jobs is within the scope of
the simple Javanese, even if he could afford
to pay for it, which he can’t. If .lie had
been made a present of the whole of this
continent, it is doubtful whether he would
have learnt to irrigate a tomato-bed. There
is only one man with the insolent courage to
try to irrigate a country with the natural
disadvantages of Australia, and that is the
white man. He has started on the task
without reference to the amiable and in-
teresting Javanese, and will doubtless finish
it without reference to him. If the stock-
broker must have his commission to Java it
had better go with a view to inquiring how
a range of volcanic mountains 2000 miles
long and 10,000 feet high can be erected in
the centre of Australia. Then this country
might be able to afford to abandon its pre-
sent methods and relapse into the compara-
tive primitivism of the Javanese.

PLAIN ENGLISH.
The No-Noes Have It.
The legislative powers asked for by the
Bruce-Page Government, with the concur-
rence of most of the Federal Labor members
except as to control of essential services,
have been very emphatically refused. Though
votes are still coming in it was clear before
midnight on Saturday that the Government
had no earthly chance of getting a general
majority of votes for either of the Constitu-
tional Alteration Bills or of carrying a
majority of States. In South Aus. the Noes
were nearly 3 to 1, as at the 1919 referen-
dum. There is a faint prospect of the Essen-
tial Services question being carried in Tas-
mania, but on the Industry and Commerce
issue the island’s Antis prevailed, as in
1911, 1913 and 1919. On the other hand,
Victoria and Westralia, which said Yes-Yes
seven years ago, said No-No this time; Vic-
toria, which was nearly 2 to 1 for then,
being over 2 to 1 against now. The pro-
posals fared best in the States where ex-
tremist Labor Governments rule. In Queens-
land, though the Essential Services question
will probably be defeated, the Noes are only
5000 or so ahead on Industry and Commerce,
and a small Yes majority is still possible.
In N. S. Wales, hitherto the spiritual home
of the State Righter, while the Ayes have
always been a little behind on Essential Ser-
vices they have a lead of nearly 1000 on the
other and more important question, and will
probably win. But whether they win or not
Premier Lang will derive no satisfaction
from a study of the voting, particularly if he
looks up subdivisional details in the farming
districts which gave him his majority last
year. Neither can the Prime Minister have been
pleased when the figures from his own State
and constituency reached him on the steamer
which is carrying him to the Imperial Con-
ference. He will perhaps learn from his dis-
comfiture that the people arc not to be
rushed into sanctioning Constitutional
amendments, however necessary (and The
Bulletin believes that these and even
greater amendments are necessary) ; that
they object to casting an uninformed vote,
as, in the hurry of the proceedings and the
absence of official pamphlets, hundreds of
thousands were invite d to do; and that they
don’t like to see the head of the Australian
Government shutting up Parliament year
after year and rushing away to London. A
less plain, blunt man than Bruce has proved
himself to be would, moreover, have made
more cunning preparations for the appeal.
Thus from a tactical point of view it was
silly of an Administration about to approach
the people for extension of Federal powers
to select that very time for encroaching upon
the prerogative of the States, as Bruce’s
Ministry is d ung in its road-construction
scheme. .

Is Tammany Coming to Melbourne?
Twenty-two suburban councillors have just
been elected to the mayoral thrones of tlie same
number of Melbourne’s maddeningly numerous
municipal councils, and there have been
accusations that the seekers of these offices
have been actuated by a greedy desire to get
to the “cupboards” provided. There can be
little in that plaint. Caulfield, which allows
its mayor £450 p.a., is the largest giver, and
Ringwood, which disburses a mere £5O, is
the most niggardly. Some of the cupboards
are dry and some are wet, but none offer
sufficient justification for the eager scramble to
reach them. The whole sum allocated may dis-
appear at a single mayoral garden-party and
leave the disburse! - dependent on his private
pocket for the drinks and smokes which
advertise his pomp and generosity. Where
it has not been the plain call of public duty,
the principal impulse hitherto actuating seek-
ers of this office has been vanity and the
prestige which helps his private business.
Of late, however, the contests have been ren-
dered more willing and less polite by the
arrival of a new element, the Labor organi-
sation. Last December Pirluun’>d Council,
under instructions from the Central Labor
Executive, voted £lOO towards a. plebiscite
for the job of mayor, said plebiscite not to
be confined to ratepayers but to take m all
voters on the Federal roll for Richmond.
Later it was told by the Public Works De-
partment that it must not hold its referen-
dum, such being a blatant evasion of the
Local Government Act, which provides that
mayors must be elected by the council. Pluck-
ing up heart at this defeat of their A.L.I.
bosses, some of the 14 Labor councillors, who
wanted to turn out the Labor nominee,
planned a surprise visit to the Council Cham-
ber, where, with the assistance of the one
non-Labor member, they could vote like free
men. A panting motor-car was alleged to
be in wait to assist in carrying out this
daring manoeuvre; but when the solitary non-
Labor bumble assembled for the fray, he
found himself alone and without even the
hind-leg of a quorum. The A.L.P. had
cracked the whip, and the rebellion had col-
lapsed. This is the gentle intimation the
rebels had perused:—
We [the A.L.P.] may point out for your informa-
tion that the selection of Cr. O’Connell for the
position of Mayor was endorsed by the central execu-
tive, and any Labor councillor who works or votes
against the election of Cr. O’Connell for the
position will place himself in the same position
as a member of the Labor party who votes against
the selected Labor candidate at any Parliamentary
or municipal election.
The result was a foregone conclusion, Labor
bumbles being as timid under threats of ex-
pulsion nowadays as their Parliamentary col-
leagues. The immediate prize was only £3OO
and a wet cupboard, but as a preliminary
skirmish on behalf of Field-Marshal Tam-
many, it was useful to the “movement.” It
indicated to the hungry job-seekers what side
their bread was buttered on and who butters
it. Fitzroy, another big municipality with
a powerful Labor stratum, has voted for its
own obliteration in the Greater Melbourne
Council, and others will doubtless follow.
The larger field is opening ahead, and a little
party discipline is valuable by way of anti-
cipation. If Greater Melbourne isn’t to be-
come like Sydney, the happy hunting-ground
of overbearing Labor bosses, early measures
to stop illegal interference with municipal
matters will need to be concerted.

Machinery as a Fertile Cause of Wages.
In the holdings-forth of the professional phil-
anthropists of the Labor movement —those
who toil not except with the jaw nor spin
anything save yarns—there is one important
person who gets less mention than he de-
serves. In fact, he gets no mention at all.
The missing factor is the inventor or sup-
plier of machinery. When discoursing in
Parliament and the press and the Domain,
and when talking before 44-hour boards
and the like, there is a monotonous pursuit of
one line of assumption by the Croftses and
Gardens and Walshes, the strike-makers,
the blue, red and striped revolutionaries, and
all their kin. It is that the improvement
made in the worker’s lot has been solely due
to their untiring conversational efforts, and
that for all future improvement their vocabu-
lary and perspiration will be" wholly respon-
sible. Yet the machinery man is working
all the time. In his three days’ “opening”
discourse to the three Judges of the new
Arbitration Court advocate Crofts mostly
took 1908 as a sort of starting-point. The up-
lift apparently dated from then. In that year
there were 257,494 employees in Australian
factories, and they were helped on their
way by 242,416 horse-power of machinery
in actual use. In 1924 the employees num-
bered 429,990, and the machinery which
worked for them amounted to 1,110,774
horse-power. The money invested in appara-
tus rose in much the same proportion, and
wages rose, and conditions improved, and
the demand for the easier life grew as fast
as anything else. The position might be ex-
pressed in this way :
1908. 1923-24.
Horse-power per worker.. Eleven-twelfths 2f
Plant and machinery
per worker (value) .. £lOl 0 0 £232 0 0
Wages per worker (year) 80 19 9 187 12 3
■Value of work done per
worker .. .. 150 0 0 328 0 0
The figures will suggest a lot of things. Be-
tweeii 1908 and 1924 the average employer
bought for the assistance of the average
worker a horse (power) and rather more
than three-quarters of another horse, at a
cost of £l3l. Out of the. production of a
man and 21 horses (not his own) the man
got a greater proportion than he did in
1908 out of the production of a man and
eleven-twelfths of a horse (another man’s).
His share increased from 54 per cent, to 57
per cent. The fact that half the horse-power
in 1924 had been added during five years
(and probably a good deal of the other half
was new also, having taken the place of old
apparatus gone to the scrap-heap) is an
argument against the theory that the Aus-
tralia); manufacturer is a backward cuss,
whose inability to work miracles is due to his
use of antiquated appliances, by which the
toiler is grievously handicapped. The Aus-
tralian manufacturer buys new apparatus
occasionally—in fact, very often. The net
output didn’t increase in the same propor-
tion as the power provided to faciliate out-
put (and. of course, the gross production
didn’t either), even if no allowance is made
for the increase in values. How far this is
due to the hostile and anti-Australian tactics
of pig-headed revolutionaries, go-slowers and
strike-makers it is impossible to say. One
matter that stands out is that improvement
in wages bears a definite relation to the
increase and improvement of machinery, and
no visible relation at all to the growth of
vulgar oratory and revolutionary propa-
ganda. If the supply of mechanical aid had
remained on the basis of 1908, the wage of
1924 would have been out of the question,
for £lB7 12s. 3d. of remuneration won’t
come out of £l5O worth of work. And it
is quite certain that somebody invents the
appliances which make industry possible
and profitable, and somebody else makes
them, and the much-abused employer pro-
vides them—the Croftses and* Gardens
and Walshes do neither one nor the other.
Further, they found no new industries, sup-
ply no employment, pay no wages, furnish
no fresh ideas and are neither useful nor
ornamental.

The Tariff Board’s Warning.
The Tariff Board’s report for 1925-26,
though placed in the hands of members of
Parliament before that institution closed
down for the year, was not issued to the
public till last week. Only a thing of a
dozen pages, it could have been turned out
in a day or two, but that would have shat-
tered all departmental traditions, so the
large number of people interested in tariff
matters had to wait. The board says (and
repeats the statement) that it has been
“greatly exercised in mind by reason of the
excessive nature of the competition which
is developing between the products of Europe
and similar products manufactured within
the Commonwealth.” It quotes some arrest-
ing statistics as to wages paid and hours of
labor worked in the iron and steel industry:
In Germany the current average wage ia 325. 6d.
for a week varying from 54 to 60 hours.
In Belgium the wage is 235. 6d. and in France
345. 6d. for a nominal week of 48 hours, in which
considerable laxity as to working hours is allowed.
In the U.K. the wage is 61s. for a week of 48
hours, which is strictly enforced.
In the Commonwealth the wage is 108 s. 6d. for
a week which is a rigid 48 hours, but which now
may be permanently reduced to 44 hours.
Hence the increased Protection on barbed
wire, netting, rails, fishplates, beams, girders,
joists and the rest. But the board sees no
virtue in raising the tariff if wages go up
with the duties every time. “This course,”
it declares, “must ultimately defeat itself,
and by continuously raising the cost of living
bring about an industrial paralysis.” It
records its strong objection to what hap-
pened in the woollen industry, when tariff
assistance to mills which were not earning
enough to pay existing rates of wages was
made to prop up a case for heavy additions
to those wages. “In the sugar industry also,”
following the Commonwealth embargo on
imports, “further heavy wage increases were
ordered by the Queensland Board of Trade
and Arbitration, notwithstanding that such
industry was struggling against a heavy loss
on the exportable surplus, and was being
kept alive at the expense of the Australian
people.” These pertinent remarks follow: —
From considerations such, as the foregoing, the
board is strongly of opinion that the unions should
be induced to realise tlie critical position into which
the Commonwealth is drifting, and the absolute
necessity for preventing the wages gap from becoming
still wider between the U.K., the continent of Europe
and the Commonwealth. Otherwise the board, placed
as it is in the position to take a comprehensive and
intimate view of all Australian industry, can see
nothing but economic disaster ahead, and that at
no very distant date.
It is a fair warning, and should be soberly
considered, instead of being dismissed with
fury and abuse. The benefits of Protection
are certainly not for employers alone. Union-
ists-are entitled to .share in them, and the
more industry prospers the greater their
share should be. But it is utter folly to
make crushing demands on < employers just
when a tariff increase is helping them off the
rocks. There is a limit to the wages a busi-
ness can pay, and that limit has been reached
in many Australian industries which have
to meet fierce foreign competition ; in some
it has been exceeded, and if Commonwealth
grants were withdrawn they would perish.
In fact, the industrial situation is such that
Labor leaders ought to be, considering ways
and means of reducing the cost of living
instead of planning further increases in
wages—increases from which their members
derive no lasting benefit, since cost-of-living
always catches up, and which may end in
depriving them of their jobs. In a continent
where half the people live in five coastal capi-
tals. reducing H.C.L. is no easy task. Still,
there are possibilities in co-operative
arrangements with organised bodies of pro-
ducers. . ’

Canada’s Election Issues.
“L.M.L.” (Quebec) : Canada's political
affairs, which have been in a muddled con-
dition since the King Administration came
into power as a result of war weariness in
1021, are once more in the melting-pot. A
second general election within a year is
due on September 11, and tired and fed-up
voters are hoping to get a real Government
as a result. Anything, it is generally agreed,
will be better than the state of affairs
brought about through the existence of a
third party, the Progressives, representing
the farmers of the West, who take their
political thought from the adjoining Ameri-
can agricultural States. The Progressives
have held the balance of power in the Cana-
dian Parliament for most of the past five
years, and have, through their influence, been
mainly instrumental in robbing Canada of
600,000 of its native born. Foreign (mainly
U.S.) competition has been encouraged
through a low tariff, and closed-down facto-
ries and emigration to the United States have
been the result. Recently a dramatic turn
of fortune’s wheel forced King out. Even
the Progressives could not stomach the orgy
of corruption which a Parliamentary inquiry
showed to exist in the civil service. It was
proved that a former Minister of Customs
had been guilty of questionable practices,
having accepted large gifts of liquor from
whisky smugglers. Members of the Civil
Service Commission were found to be simi-
larly besmirched. A newly appointed Mini-
ster of Customs was also accused of dubious
behavior. Conservatives introduced a motion
of censure; Progressives made known that
they would support such a vote: King asked
for a dissolution —he did not dare to chal-
lenge the House. Lord Byng, the Governor-
General, refused King’s request, and gave
the largest single party, the Conservatives,
with 116 seats out of 245, the chance to
form an Administration. Meigiien, (lie
Conservative leader, of evil odor among
King’s French supporters by reason of his
success in conscripting them in the late
war, took up the reins of office. After 6M
houi-s he was defeated in the House and
asked for and obtained the dissolution which
King had been refused. At once King and
his supporters raised the cry that the Gov-
ernor-General had behaved in an unconstitu-
tional manner by refusing the Liberals
what he granted the Conservatives. Downing-
streeU is also accused of interfering in Cana-
dian internal politics. The charge is quite
unfair; for the G.-G. was bound to give the
biggest numerical party a chance to carry on
after the leader of the Government had con-
fessed that the. House was against him. The
real issues are simple. They are merely
whether the country wants a “Canada first”
policy under the Conservatives—meaning a
high tariff directed chiefly against the United
States —or does it favor a low tariff, which
means making Canada a milch cow for the
benefit of U.S. A. industries? This last
is the policy that the Liberals, under the
fear of defeat by Progressive votes, have
adopted. The Progressives, of course, being
farmers, are low-tariffists. They don’t think
their own products would be affected by Free-
trade, and they want cheap machinery, etc.,
no matter where it comes from. Political
wiseacres are chary of prophesying the result.
A few salient tendencies, however, are the
slow death of the Progressives: they dropped
in five years from 63 members to 27, losing
seats to both Liberals and Conservatives. It
is believed that they will lose still more seats
in this election, mainly to the Liberals. In
the East, the Conservatives may make a few
more gains; but it is very doubtful if they
will gain more seats in Quebec, where they
now hold only 4 out of 65, all English-speak-
ing. The French-Canadians are almost solidly
Liberal; though they are Protectionist at
heart, they hate Meighen and his wartime
policies. A strong Government, either Con-
servative or Liberal, does not, therefore, seem
to be probable. Meantime, while the poli-
ticians rage, Canada’s war burden of taxa-
tion has been hardly lessened at all, the
Government railways are a millstone, and
the best of the country’s youth emigrate
by thousands to the abounding opportunities
in the republic to the south.

Waving the Old Banner.
Taking as its text the wail of Duncan
Carson about the high cost of growing
wool and manicuring sheep under a Pro-
tective tariff, the S. M. Herald recently
worked itself into a very bad fit of the blues
concerning the future of this continent.
After a study of statistics it sobbed piti-
fully because it had discovered these things:
Australia exports 46 per cent, of her primary
produce and only 5 or 6 per cent, of her manu-
factures. , ~ , . ~
She sells her exports to countries which tor the
most part maintain a much lower standard of living
than she does, which means that the market price
is unfavorable. .
Her Labor politicians aim continually at higher
wages and reduced hours of labor, and show positively
no concern for the improvement of the service labor
renders.
These things are facts right enough, and
they aren’t calculated to make any
good Australian want to jump with joy. So
far, The Bulletin listens to the Herald
with respectful interest; and when the
venerable journal goes on to remark that
these symptoms are especially bad in a
country that isn’t self-contained, respectful
interest blossoms into warm approval. But hav-
ing stated its case with its accustomed sobri-
ety and devotion to truth, the Herald flies
back into the dim cavern in which it had
its birth and hauls out a tattered banner
inscribed “Lower Wages For All!” and
“Down With Protection!” That the second
slogan, if given legislative effect, might en-
force the first as a natural consequence can
scarcely be doubted, but the Herald knows
very well that its panacea isn’t going to be
applied, and it£ pious aspirations aren’t
intended as a practical solution of the prob-
lem. Yet the journal stumbled on the right
track in the course of the very disquisition
on Carson’s text to which reference is here
made. The sentence seems almost to have
been smuggled in by some enemy of Cobden :
Unfortunately for Australia... .she has to sell
nearly half her primary production abroad and receive
goods in payment, less only the amounts which are
kept as interest oil her external loans.
If she didn’t have to sell her produce abroad,
but could sell it at home to the people who
were supplying her with the goods she at
present imports, then the sweating propensi-
ties of Old World manufacturers wouldn't
worry Australia. A continent maintaining
a proper balance between primary and sec-
ondary production can tell the rest of the
world - to go to Sheol if it feels that way.
Its people wouldn’t be able to consume more
than they earned, it is true; but no nation
can do that for very long in any circum-
stances, and it isn’t good for any nation to
get the notion that it can be done. Once the
idea gets firmly implanted in the minds of
our politicians that the main thing that
matters is the earning capacity of the people
—character and goodliness are bound up in
it —sound and enduring prosperity will be
within coo-ee. And so far as practical ex-
periments in statecraft have gone, a Pro-
tective tariff and a policy of rewarding
high production with high wages are the
only two things that can be relied on to
improve earning power. It is just these
two things the Herald thinks it would like
to see banned.
A Defence Map of Australia.
“Dr. Nil”: Apropos The Bulletin's article
headed “Wanted, a Map of Australia.” Some
five years before the Great War, when the
subject of Australian military organisation
was being much discussed, the late Colonel
Le Messurier and I collaborated to draw
up a scheme for the production of just such
a map. The Colonel had great military
qualifications for the task, and had served
in S’Africa; my own consisted in many
years’ experience of travelling through all
kinds of country in Australia on horseback,
in vehicles and on foot. Put as briefly as
possible, this was our suggestion. The coun-
try to be mapped was to be divided into suit-
able areas, and the adult males in these areas
formed into commandoes, somewhat similar
to those of the Boers. The commandoes were
to elect their own committees and executive,
officers. The function of each commando
was to furnish periodical reports as to the
following matters, amongst others: —
(1) Roads.—Particulars as to distances, suitability
for various kinds of traffic, bearings of useful land-
marks, water supply, fuel and food supply, etc.
(2) Habitations. —Accommodation for men and
animals on route marches; distances and bearings
across country.
(3) Personnel.—Number and description of persons
available and capable of assisting troops moving
through the district, as guides or in any other
capacity.
(4) Any other information required by the militari-
authorities.
But the chief object of the organisation was
the production of a detailed plan of the topo-
graphy of the whole country. It was recog-
nised that such a plan would not be as accu-
rate as an ordnance map, but the Boers had
no better, and we have none at all. There
was to be no pay, no uniform and no arms;
most of the duly could be done without cut-
ting into working time. We sent our draft

It is announced that Westralia expects to
have 2,776,818 acres under wheat for next
harvest. There are to be also 454,034 acres
under oats, 17,114 acres under barley, and
not much under anything else. When the
Westralian has raised a lot of wheat for
export and a fair amount of hay for home
use he is pretty well satisfied with himself.
Among the articles of which he imports (or
imported in 1924-25) more than he exports
are butter, cheese, eggs, honey, bacon, hams,
every kind of fresh meat except plain cold
beef (and imports of that almost equal ex-
ports), beans, peas, maize, barley, bran, pol-
lard, oatmeal, hops, onions and potatoes;
also cattle, horses, pigs and sheep. It is
sometimes made a local grievance that the
Eastern States furnish the golden, glowing
West with butter, cheese, potatoes, etc., free
of duty (in fact, that they “flood” it with
these goods) ; but it might not feel so well
if they didn’t. The reason of Westralia’s in-
tense adhesion to one line is not easy to de-
cide. It has plenty of climates, yet it is the
most wheaty State in the Commonwealth.

The time will come when drawing analogies
between modern tendencies and the Decline
and Fall of Rome will be made a punishable
offence. The latest misdemeanant is the
London correspondent of a Berlin paper who
compares John Buut/s effeminate youth,
erotic literature, sex drama, doles, orgies and
festivals of sport to the conditions afflicting
the Roman Empire before its downfall. He
says sport ruined the Roman Empire, and he
expects, and probably nightly prays for, the
ruin likewise of Britain. Many reasons have
been given for the fall of Rome. In fact,
every historian with a bee in his bonnet has
blamed his pet insect for the entire tragedy.
The fact has escaped the Jeremiahs that
the fall was no spectacular wallop, but a
very leisurely affair. In fact, the thud of
Rome itself was scarcely heard in the uproar
of new building at Byzantium, whither Con-
stantine transferred the capital of his
empire in a.d. 330. Although the empire had
suffered from corruption, slaves and fancy
sins for hundreds of years, it started on a
career of glory from the new centre which
landed it with a bigger bloat of riches, terri-
tory and power than ever before. It did not
finally disappear until 1453, when a Turkish
army assisted by European renegades be-
sieged and took Constantinople, which was
all of the empire left; and in between, under
resolute leaders, it frequently overcame all
the ailments which are alleged to have been
sapping its vitality, and recovered its healthy
tone. So the invalid took a thousand years
to die after it was supposed to have utterly
collapsed; and lots of things can happen in
a thousand years, including the birth of
capable leaders and other things.

“Centurion"; The contention of Frederick
Stubbs (B. 2/9/'26) that modern Germany
is a natural friend and France a natural
foe is an old one. It was the cause of Brit-
ish non-preparedness in 1914: for the de-
scription of the German as simple, kindly,
industrious and sober was on the lips of
men much greater in the world’s eye than
Mr. Stubbs, but not less foolish, up to and
long after August 4, 1914. The German
love for England to-day may be touching.
But last week's cables told us of the cadets
of a British mercantile training craft being
hooted in the streets at Kiel; and a ferocious
attack on British incompetence, decadence
and vice is now enjoying a popular run in
a leading Berlin newspaper. If further proof
were needed, the huge militarist and mon-
archist festival in Bavaria the other day
should leave no doubts that the German is
unchanged by his recent experiences. There
is no better illustration of it than the gather-
ing’s aspirations as set out in its propa-
ganda : “We deliberately reject the ‘No War’
cry, and devote ourselves to fight for the free-
dom of the Fatherland.”

“Kaloola” : Re overstocking in Queensland
(B. 29/7/’26). The facts are, the grasses
in the pastoral areas will stand for 12
months without rain: after that they are
useless, and stock will die if not moved or
artificially fed. After 12 months without
useful rain, and even if no stock has been
on them, the grasses are not nutritive, being
bleached and dried by the sun and rotted by
showers ; so if we stocked on drought capa-
city we would carry none at all. The idea
is to strike the happy medium, i.e., to stock
on the capacity of average seasons, and I
think most experienced graziers do that. I
am not denying that there is overstocking,
but the area overstocked is infinitesimal
compared with the whole sheep area, and is
occupied by those who are compelled against
their own judgment, by small areas and high
rentals. It is not so necessary that the
grasses should seed each year, as the Mitchell
grass, which we mainly depend on, is peren-
nial. The fact that Queensland carried
21,708,3)0 sheep in 1892 when the pastoral
areas were badly watered, and 19,156.586 in
1925 at the commencement of the drought, is
proof that the present disaster was not due
to overstocking, but to the absence of rain,
which, given time, would reduce the most
fertile country in the world to a desert;
many stations in Central Queensland have
had under 2iu. of rain during the last IS
months. The only solution is the building
of lateral railways connecting with Bourke
and the Queensland branch lines in the wool-
producing area.

“P.M.” ; Premier Lang may know something
about some things, but the Victorian dairy-
ing industry is not one of them. Trying to
find an explanation for Holden sox and
Neilson moving their butter factory from
Albury across the border into Vic., iie said
the real reason was neither the Workers’
Compensation Act nor the 44-llonr Act, but
the fact that in Victoria the farmer was paid
for cream received, while in N. S. Wales he
was paid on the basis of butter manufac-
tured. He is quite wrong. Take the case
of a farmer sending 3001 b. of cream to the fac-
tory. It tests, say, 40 p.c. The Victorian
factory pays him for 1201 b. of butter-fat at
Is. 6d —£9, and makes it into 1441 b. butter,
including moisture and salt. The N. S.
Wales factory pays him for 1441 b. of com-
mercial butter at Is. 3d., also £9. The only
difference is that the Vic. method of calculat-
ing is the one recognised by all the leading
dairy countries and dairy chemists of the
world.

“Clerk” : Vic. Railway Commissioner
Clapp’s decision to replace 11-ton trucks
with 20-ton vehicles has brought such an
’E WADDEN NO SHIRKED.
“Wha’s ’ee stop for, Eupho? Gone on strike, 'arc ’ee?”
“Gone on strike? ’ Coorse. I ain’t! I done my shift, as ’ee’ll see if ’ee looks to the
time-sheet.”
avalanche of protest that it is surprising to
find the arguments not all on the side of
his critics. The question off introducing larger
trucks is not new. It first cropped up in
1903, when a board of investigators said
some unkind things about the small truck
and trundled the present 16-ton vehicle on to
the scene. The average tare weight of the
11-ton truck is of tons, so that, for every
11 tons it carries, a dead weight of more
than half that has to be „hauled also. On
the other hand, the 16-ton truck weighs only
seven tons, which enables it to accommodate
five tons more than its smaller edition for
less than one and a half tons increase in
dead haulage. The 20-ton truck will in turn
have an advantage over the 16-tonner. The
benefit of this increased elbow-room is indi-
cated by the fact that, had it been decided
in 1903 to continue building smaller stock,
something like 4000 additional trucks would
now be required to handle Victoria's goods
traffic, which has grown from less than three
million tons to more than eight millions annu-
ally in the past 23 years. The 20-ton trucks
will also shorten trains. A freight train of
540 tons gross load extends for close on
700 ft. if composed of 11-ton trucks, but
barely passes the 640 ft. mark if made up of
20-tonners. This works out at a carrying
capacity of 50 p.c. more per foot in favor
of the big truck. Another point which had
to be considered was the long overdue instal-
lation of the safe and handy automatic
coupler, for which the smaller trucks are
not structurally fitted. Briefly, therefore.
Harold W. Clapp sees in larger trucks re-
duced train mileage, shorter and more com-
pact trains, improved time-keeping, less
shunting, decreased maintenance charges, a
slump in coal-consumption and a greater net
paying load per train mile.

South Africa, which has imitated more than
one phase of Australian State enterprise, and
notably Government shipping, shows signs
of following the track still further. The
new platform of the S’African Labor party,
which shares the Government with the
Hertzog Nationalists, and therefore has some
chance of giving it effect, carries a load of
Australian ideas, good and bad. Most promi-
nent are a State bank and a minimum wage.
Then follow the 44-hour week, national
ownership and control of minerals and key
industries, State markets, flour, sugar and
woollen mills, and cold-storage works. Con-
fiscation of lands, minerals and machinery,
if withheld from use without just cause,
seems specially aimed at big Jo’burg com-
panies which have kept ground undeveloped
and plant idle for years. It is a programme
full of possibilities of trouble, especially
when the fixing of the minimum wage for
white, black, yellow and streaked is
attempted.

Sot.o" : When “Babarantiko”* states (B.
10/8/’2(j> that ‘‘those who insist upon Aus-
tralian-made goods find no difficulty in having
their preference gratified,” I entirely dis-
agree; it may be so in the case of the'goods
lie specifies, but it is certainly not so with
all. Returning to Sydney recently, after an
absence in Melbourne of two years, my wife
and I have repeatedly endeavored to buy
Australian canned asparagus and asparagus
soup, which we can get in any suburb in
Melbourne. We have been unable to buy a
tin of the local goods in Darlinghurst, Coogee
and Rand wick—l think wo have asked in
every store in those districts. American
stuff is always placed before us. When we
say we won't, have the American, some of the
storekeepers descend to sarcasm, and tell us
there is no sale in Sydney for the Australian
article. In one Darlinghurst store a sales-
man told me pityingly that the Australian
asparagus was poor!stuff; I later elicited
from him that he didn’t know one single
brand of Australian canned asparagus or
asparagus soup. Certainly his store was
full of foreign goods; even his accent, was
foreign, though he had never been out of
Sydney. In the case of these, two lines I
say definitely that if the Australian article
is not better than the foreign it is at least
equal to it. 1 personally prefer my aspara-
gus to be grown by white men in Australia
rather than by yellow men in America. What
is the reason for this disinclination to push
Australian goods? I don’t know, but the
effect is unemployment, which means bad
debts for the shopkeeper and the raising of
loans to pay doles to fools. I will say that,
apart from Perth, where everything seems
to be imported—even their sentiment —'Syd-
ney is the worst city in Australia in which
to buy Australian-made goods. I have no
axe to grind. I am not a manufacturer;
instead. I export Australian wool to foreign
countries, where foreigners turn it into goods
for Australians to buy.
“Henry IIorsecollar” : There are a lot of
things about the Mesopotamian campaign
that “Basra"’ ought to know, but possibly
doesn’t (B. 2/9/’26). In a list which in-
cludes the living and dead V.C. men of the
war there are sundry marked “Mesopotamia,
but barring Chatta Singh there isn’t one
entry which suggests a man of color. They are
mostly officers with British-sounding names
—probably men who spent themselves in
urging Chatta’s countrymen to heroic deeds.
“Basra” speaks of “three Indian V.C.’s won
during the fighting for the relief of Kut
alone.” There are certainly three names
with “Kut el Amara” appended. They are
Cookson, Cowley and Humphrey Firman.
1 didn’t suggest that it was “lack of num-
bers” that was the cause of failure in
Mespot, but lack of enough white men
among the numbers.

“(Country Fed.” : Twenty years ago, when
medical supervision of the children was
introduced in Australian schools, the
school doctors wholesomely insisted on the
abolition of the girls’ practice of carrying
their lesson books in handbags, and the boys’
practice of carrying their load in bags that
hung from one shoulder. The idea, of course,
was to prevent, curvature of the spine
or dropped shoulders, caused by the
habitual humping of a heavy weight
on one side of the body. Accordingly the
bag-makers introduced bags with two crossed
straps coming over both shoulders and dis-
tributing the burden equally. The idea has
not been passed on to their children by those
who first benefited, for with the coming of
the cheap pressed-fibrc case practically every
modern schoolgirl carries her books in one
of these cases crammed full; and only an
odd boy *wears the double-strapped bag—•
single straps are in vogue again. It is time
the school medical authorities revived the
proscription of two decades ago.
“France Murphy”: Stock is still brought
to Melbourne’s back door to be slaughtered,
just as in the days when there was no other
way of getting cattle and sheep there but
on the hoof. Certainly they mostly come in
railway trucks nowadays, but why should
they be brought at all? A prominent grazier
and organiser of tin' Farmers’ Union, who
advocates the establishment of country meat
centres throughout stock-raising areas, esti-
mates that as a result of knocking about,
trucking, yarding, etc., there is a deteriora-
tion of 3d. per lb. live weight on all fat stock
under present marketing conditions. There
are no terms in which to estimate the phy-
sical suffering and torture sustained by the
animals en route from all over the country
to execution. Moreover bringing stock to
the outskirts of the city for slaughter brings,
too, besides the repulsive abattoirs, several
of the most noxious trades that ever offended
the nose of man. Glue factories, tanneries
and media for converting blood and offal
into manure are some of them. No residen-
tial suburb wants them within smelling dis-
tance, and there is no need to bring them
to closely-settled places. The cities rely on
rail, boat and motor to supply them with
fresh milk, butter, fruit, vegetables, etc., and
if such highly perishable commodities can
be so handled there is no sound reason why
fresh meat could not also be brought from
country centres. We must have our meat,
but we ought to be provided with it with as
little mess and misery as possible.

“X.N.0.” : Wireless has recently been taught
a new trick, and can now take deep-sea
soundings. Two systems are in use with
fearsome names, the Langerin Shilowsky
Quartz and the Marty Orullograph. The
principle of each is the same: they measure
the time taken by a wireless wave to rebound
from the sea-bottom, its rate through water
being known to be 1500 metres per second.
Soundings every five seconds can thus be
obtained, but it is open to question if this
speed is required in practice. It will cer-
tainly be useful for hydrographic surveying
purposes, and will speed up the most labori-
ous and thankless part of a marine survey.
But in practice two Kelvin machines will
give a depth every 30 seconds, which is quite
fast enough for navigational purposes. The
“rebound” principle is by no means new;
many a ship has before now been kept in the
middle of a narrow fiord by rifle-fire, and
noting the interval between the shot and
the “ping” as the bullet hits the rocks, first
one side then the other. The man who can
accurately measure the range of another ship
by wireless is going to make a fortune. The
present naval rangefinder is probably the
most inaccurate mathematical instrument in
existence.

POLITIAL
POINTS
So far N. S. Wales is the only State in
which the Ayes are having the better of the
referendum argument, although the Industry
and Commerce question may yet be carried
in Queensland. Strong farming support for
Bruce’s side of the contention is a specially
remarkable feature of tlie N. S. Wales poll;
rejected everywhere by the cockies in Vic.,
the proposals have received commanding majo-
rities in all the N.S.W. farming electorates,
including even Hume, a Labor constituency.
This, of course, is tlie outcome, not of any
hearty feeling for Bruce or liis amendments,
but of the great wrath aroused by Lang and
his gang. It is so obvious a threat to this
crowd that the Labor Daily Avill have to
keep an unsleeping eye on those four
M’s.L.A. for whom emissaries of capitalism
lie in wait with £32,000 in gold.
If there had been no Lang and no Jock
Garden Victoria and South Aus. wouldn’t
have said No-No so emphatically. Away
from tlie waterfront they don’t have much
industrial trouble in those States ; so why,
they asked, hand over their affairs to any
authority in which tlie N.S.W. mischief-
makers have a big part? The same fear of
Lang, Garden and Co. which gave Bruce his
great majority at the general election was
thus largely responsible for the defeat of his
proposals in tlie referendum.
The 44-hour week was dragged into the
Constitutional controversy in the three most
populous States. “If these proposals are
adopted,” the Langs and McCormacks
shouted, “you Avill lose your 44-hour week.”
In Victoria, on the other hand, the cry Avas
that tlie Federal authority would sooner or
later reduce working hours from 48 to 44.
and thus deprive the Cabbage Garden of the
advantage it now enjoys over N. S. Wales.
Results indicate that the fear of getting the
alleged boon Avas a far more potent factor
than the fear of losing it. While every Vic.
electorate said No, N. S. Wales said Yes,
and at latest there Avere only a few hundred
votes between Nay and Yea in Queensland.
Apparently scores of thousands of 44-hour-
week unionists Avere among the Ayes. Or
perhaps it Avas Mrs. Unionist Avho voted
Yes —the 44-hour Aveek has brought her no-
thing but dearer living and the doubtful
advantage of having Bill hanging round tlie
house on Saturday morning.
Resentment at being deprived of repre-
sentation in the Ministry and on the North
Australia Commission—to which an oppo-
nent of tlie direct North-South railway has
been appointed—had a lot to do Avith the
heavy S. Aus. vote against the referendum
questions. Hoping to allay this feeling, the
Government has named A. J. McLachlan,
the Adelaide lawyer who became a Senator
last year, a member of the Executive Coun-
cil with the title of Acting-Attorney-General,
Latham having gone abroad. He hasn’t the
Parliamentary experience of Barwell: but
lie has had a much wider experience of the
luav —he was C. C. Kingston’s last partner,
and got that great man’s affairs straight
after they had drifted into disorder.
At a meeting of the Seamen’s Union, held
to celebrate tlie granting of State registra-
tion in N. S. Wales, a speaker made some
interesting admissions. He pointed out that
some members of tlie union avlio had joined
tlie Volunteer Workers’ Association were
not “scabs.” They had joined the new union
as spies, and, when called as witnesses for
the owners, gave such evidence as turned
the scale in favor of the Seamen’s Union.
ANOTHER SWEATED INDUSTRY.
“At a conference of the council of churches in Melbourne, a delegate complained that the £156
per annum paid to missionaries was a starvation salary.”
CANNIBAL KING MAGUMBO ( dictating) : “Dear Sirs, —Kindly refrain from sending any
more missionaries on starvation wages—recent consignment found it impossible
to get into condition on the money, and the latest lot is not promising."
“Without them Ave could never have got regis-
tration. The A’olunteer organisation would
have had a walk-over.” The value of evi-
dence of that kind sinks into insignificance
beside the speaker’s suggestion that the In-
dustrial Commissioner —-“Good ole Piddo,”
as someone called him —lias been subjected
to an unseemly leg-pulling by the crowd he
lias nourished in liis bosom, to speak in
mixed metaphor.
The ink and the tears Avere hardly dry
ou the N.S.W. Industrial Commissioner’s
judgment granting registration to the Sea-
men and Firemen when a body of the
latter held up the inter-State liner Bombala.
In doing so they not onjy broke a 1925
agreement referring disputes to a local con-
ciliation committee, but resumed tlie job-
control which even Mr. Piddington finds
un pleasing. De-registered, men were
jiowerless to practise job-control, lie-regis-
tered and snivelled over, they straightway
return to tlieir old I ricks apparently in full
confidence that a tribunal benevolent enough
to restore tlieir “right” of preference Avill
stand anything.
The helpful and conversational Judge who
joins in the argument promises to become a
feature in the Australian courts. Lately tlie
three new Judges. Dethridge, Lukin and
Beeby, were sitting in their new Arbitration
Court to consider the demand for a week of
44 hours’ work and 124 hours’ leisure, and it
diverged into side-issues like this: —
Mr. Holloway submitted figures which, he said,
tended to show that output was restricted by various
large concerns.
Judge Beeby: “There is a definite policy among
pastoralists in N.S.W. to restrict the numbers of
their stock with a A r iew to keeping down production
and keeping up prices. That is an admitted fact.”
Who admits it? Generally the charge is that
the pastoralist overstocks in his greed, and
that as a result there is dreadful suffering
among dumb animals in drought time.
N.S.W. reached a climax in 1891, with
01.831,416 sheep. It struck bottom in 1902,
with 26,049,424. Judge Beeby may put this
down to “a definite policy” of restriction.
People who know a bit more about it will
put it down to a sinful attempt to make
the country carry more slieep than it coull.
It looks as if there will be a compromise
in regard to the redistribution of Vic. Assem-
bly seats. If the 65 electorates scheme pro-
posed by the Government is adhered to, tlie
city may get 25 instead of the 24 previously
offered, subject to the inclusion of a little
more territory—a bit of Dandenong, the
borough of Ringwood and a piece of Bulla.
At present there are 21 city and 44 country
seats. Some country members would sanc-
tion nine more city seats if they were allowed
to retain their present 44 —anything, in fact,
for a quiet life.
N.S.W. Premier Lang is a dirty fellow.
On tlie last Sunday before tlie referendum
lie reiterated his year-old charge that Bruce
had made it a condition of the wharf-labor-
ers’ strike settlement that the Clan Monroe,
“crammed Avith German goods for Paterson,
Laing and Bruce,” should be unloaded. The
tale was given tlie lie direct by the accused
party, and Holloway, of Melbourne Trades
Hall, testified that Bruce had («) taken no
part in the discussions, withdrawing before
they began, (6) laid down no conditions of
any sort, and (c) never mentioned the Clan
Monroe or any other ship. The myth forth-
with vanished from Lang’s rcpertoirc-—to he
dug up just as Bruce was leaving for the
Dominions Conference, and when it could not
be overtaken.
A melancholy and prophetic Hun who
foresees the downfall of Britain has attracted
sufficient notice in London to have his con-
densed Avail sent out by cable: —
He speaks of effeminate youth and erotic literature.
He describes dole queues as identical with the giving
of grain and bread to the poor classes of the old
Roman Empire. The English stage is exactly si mil a i
to the Roman during the decline, and out or 10
plays eight are concerned with sex. The wild orgies
and festivities which were common during the Roman
decline were similar to those of Engnud to-day. .Sport
ruined the Roman Empire. It may also rum that of
Britain.
But there is a trace of hope. J. Bull still
plays his own cricket and kicks his own foot-
bali, not having got to the point of import-
ing gladiators to play for him. All is not
lost.
The N.S.W. Government’s “conference of
primary producers,” to be held at Bathurst
on September 21, promises to be the greatest
joke of the Lang regime. The three genuine
associations of primary producers, the 1. 1 •
Union, the Graziers’ Association and the
Farmers and Settlers’, are allowed one dele-
gate apiece. All the big unions not linked
with the Moscow-run Trades and Labor
Council will furnish a representative apiece.
The council, however, will send eight dele-
gates. These comprise Jock Garden, a postal
employee, a rubber worker, a coaclimaker, a
blacksmith, a painter, an ironworker and a
boilermaker. Except for tlie last, who might
come in handy for riveting the eyes on pota-
toes, the presence of such persons at an
agricultural conference would be an inex-
plicable mystery to anyone without Premier
Lang’s sense of humor.
Some returned soldiers in Brisbane arc
still fiercely angry with the Bruce Govern-
ment for letting Dr. Hirsclifeld return to
his Australian wife and family. Hirsclifeld
was the most prominent German in Queens-
land for many years before the war, and the
trouble in his and nearly all similar cases
is that the Government won’t say Ayliat the
charges were upon which they interned
these men. In Brisbane hundreds —perhaps
thousands —of people still believe that the
doctor mysteriously disappeared after an
equally mysterious outbreak of meningitis
in the soldiers’ camp ; and it is certain that
the story will be believed by many until the
truth regarding the case is told. And his
case is not singular. From every State citi-
zens of German birth with Australian fami-
lies have appealed to the Government to
publish the facts, etc., upon which it pro-
ceeded to intern or deport. They mostly
say that the facts, even if distorted, can’t
be half as bad as tlie suspicions, and that
their Australian-born children are the great-
est sufferers while the matter is left where
it is.
The passage of the Queensland Salary
Grab Bill was accompanied by some of those
mysterious revelations without which no
Labor Government seems to be able to get
along nowadays. Galled by Opposition pro-
tests, Pollock, Chairman of Committees, said
that five of the other side had “approached”
him with the object of getting bis pals to
make it £lOOO p.a. Pressed for names.
Pollock’s lips again took on tlie seal of
secrecy, and the revelations continued un-
revealed in the usual manner.
By using freely the existing closure (“that
the question be now put”) Vic. Premier
Allan got his guillotine standing-order through
the Assembly last week. The thing was done
before cock-crow, and Labor, beaten at its
own game of finesse, took it badly. Having
got all they could out of the standing-orders
handbook and May, Laborites planned to hold
up business, and the Ministry was forced to
devise counter-moves. A side-tracking
amendment to refer the new proposals to the
standing-orders committee of tlie House was
defeated, but time-wasting went on. The
Ministry then said there would be action in
two hours. At tlie end of that time, under
the gag already applied on the amendment, it
claimed, and was granted by the Speaker, the
right to a division on the main question.
Amid wild abuse of Bowser, Hogan led liis
bunch outside, the new order was put
through, and Deputy-Governor Irvine
approved it next day.
Tlie press published two curiously analo-
gous statements last week. One was a cabled
declaration that the ex-Kaiser had been able
to preserve the peace of the world for 30
years, “and, with God’s help, will do it
again.” The other quoted Premier Lang, of
N.S.W., as saying that by peaceful means
he had settled the Commonwealth shipping
strike after Mr. Bruce had failed, and that
since then the Commonwealth Line had paid
its way.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“W.A. Government Statistician Bennett, in a paper
read before the Science Congress at Perth, said
that Tasmania had the highest longevity rate in the
Commonwealth and W.A. the lowest. The average
Tasmanian might expect about 6A years more of
life than the AVest Australian to lament his sorrows
and disabilities under Federation.”
The Groper and the Mutton-bird
Conversed across the Bight
And wept some wireless tears about
Their pitiable plight.
“ ’Tis bitter hard,” observed the first;
The other groaned “Too right!”
“From Federal crooks,” the Groper said,
“We’ll never force our dues.
So vile their deeds I hardly know
What epithets to choose.”
“D —d leeches,” snapped the Mutton-bird;
“Unprincipled yahoos!
“Our customs duties first of all
They scrupled not to take;
Our dole of one pound five a nut
. They now propose to shake,
This bandit crew.” The Groper sobbed
As if his heart Avould break.
“Brothers in slavery,” he moaned,
“You in your isle so small,
I in my half a continent,
You have one ••pull withal,
Albeit why it should be so
I cannot tell at all.
“Your span of life, ’tis found, exceeds
Substantially mine.
You’ve half a dozen years the more
For corn and oil and wine,
And raspberry tarts and briefs in Tatt'.’s
And surfing in the brine.”
“Six extra years’ affliction, too,
For sorely tortured flesh;
Six rears the more for cursing Fate
And bellowing Secesh—
Call that a boon?” the Mutton-bird
Inquired and wept afresh.
“Thrice happier you from galling chains
By pitying gods set free,
‘ AA'ho dodge six years of sweat and debt
And grinding misery
That Federation needs must mean
For chaps like you and me.”
The Groper and the Mutton-bird
Across the sea they spoke :
The iron was in their inmost souls;
They reckoned that a bloke
Had better far be cold and stiff
Than ’heath the Federal yoke.

Paid capital at June 30 was £1,756,800 in
292,800 shares of £lO each, paid to £6. Only
three-quarters of the profits disclosed was
eaten by the 10 p.c. div., leaving a solid sum
to be added to the already corpulent reserves.
And what is visible is undoubtedly well sup-
ported by internal provision for contingen-
cies. In the 1925 term, for instance, although
considerably more capital was at work, and
the period was one of the richest on record,
the accounts showed net earnings somewhat,
lower than those for 1924. Pretty plainly
the management took advantage of the re-
markable prosperity to provide for all the
risks it could think of. There has been
much of this caution in the co.’s later his-
tory. But shareholders have no complaint
to offer. In 1919 £90,000 was brought to
light; and in 1923 £109,650. And it may
be accepted that the co. has not departed
from its wise policy of Safety First. Although
pastoral finance houses have had a run of
wonderful years, and although the outlook
is bright, Elder-Smiths have been long
enough in the business to know that there
is always the danger of serious setbacks.
Furthermore, the co. is expanding rapidly,
and new business, taken in a period of high
prices, calls for more safeguards, as a rule,
than old. Consider the recent growth :

The co.’s position as - a money-spinner is
remarkably strong; despite the fact that
more than a million and a quarter is in
Government stocks or at short call, last
year’s disclosed profit was equal to almost
12.2 p.c. on paid capital or 8 p.c. on total
funds.
Although the run of good seasons will
break sooner or later, the co. can face con-
tingencies with a confidence that must be
almost as comforting to debtors as to credi-
tors and shareholders. Of liabilities total-
ling £2,044,383, no less than £1,284,421 was
covered by cash and Government stocks,
and for the balance there were advances, etc.,
in the books at £3,269,260. And there are
freeholds in at £495,739 less £409.005 writ-
ten off, and leaseholds and plant written
down to £59,888. Shareholders can see,
£9 2s. 6d. in tangible assets for each share
paid to £6. As there is no doubt as to the
co.’s capacity to maintain 10 p.c. as a mini-
mum distribution under almost any condi-
tions ; as it is hoped that sooner or later
the co. will again bring reserves into the light
for capitalisation; as visible accumulations
are themselves of intriguing proportions; as
there is no goodwill in the accounts, though
its value is very great (the house has an
enviable reputation built up in ST years of
trading) ; and-*—most modest of all anticipa-
tions—further issues at par seem reasonably
sure, buyers have to pay £ll 3s. for the
shares.

The market says 495. 6d. ; and as there are
strong buyers at that, we’ll say 50s. to sim-
plify things. That means a return of 4 p.c.
on the investment. Obviously the market
has large expectations; but what would it
have to get in the way of bonus shares be-
fore the investment brought in 6 p.c.—not a
penny too much for a stock dependent on the
pastoral industry in one State? Present
capital is £220,000 in £1 shares fully paid ;
and there will have to be five gift issues of
20,000 and another of 10,000 shares to make
the present shares worth the present price
to the man who looks for a 6 p.c. return.
Of course, that doesn’t look impossible; for
110,000 shares have been issued in bonuses
during the past seven years, and one of those
was a bad year. But there is just this to
remember: every 20,000 new shares issued
makes it harder to issue the next 20,000.
By the time the £300,000 mark has been
reached by the capital the 10 p.c. div. will
call for £30,000 p.a.; and a simultaneous
20,000 share bonus out of the year’s earnings
would call for a total profit of £so,ooo—some-
thing the co. has never reached. No doubt many
of those who buy shares at very high prices
in expectation of bonuses trust to reducing
their average by selling the bonus scrip ; but
the time comes when that is difficult, too.
Without doubt, Pitt, Son is a fine concern,
with a great goodwill; all the Wild Gat sug-
gests is that buyers are discounting the
future tremendously. If we could be sure
that the conditions of the last four years
would continue, such' market prices would
not be so perilous. But not only lias w-00l
been at exceptional levels; conditions gener-
ally have been wonderfully favorable. A
hint of what can happen is visible in results
for 1921, and that was not a disastrous year
by any means.
Heavy carry-over of wool altered the 1925
balance-sheet figures from their conventional
proportions, but the clearance of those stocks
last year brought them back to normal: —

Except under abnormal circumstances, such
as in the 1925 term, the co. does not go out-
side for much accommodation. It is not a
pastoral-finance co.; it may be forced now
and then into making advances against pro-
duce, but good times have of late years en-
abled it to stick close to its policy of let-
ting others do their proper work of financing
the industry. The trouble is that, the harder
times are, the more difficult it is to refuse
advances and keep customers —as it found
out 20-odd years ago. During the past year
portion of the co.’s holding of Commonwealth
stock (£40,000) matured, and the balance
was sold. Proceeds were placed on fixed
deposit, the total of which (including in-
terest accrued) at .June 30 amounted to
£151,250. Other assets were freehold pro-
perty, £149,068, and sundry debtors,
£183,806. Tim amount at fixed deposit is
out of the ordinary, and the profit-earning
capacity of funds is slowed down thereby.
With some concerns the big bank balance
would look like a pending return of capital;
but this is a business in which available cash
may come in very handy at unexpected times.
And, anyhow, what would be the good of
reducing the capital if the 10 p.c. div.
couldn’t be lifted?—and divs. beyond 10 p.c.
are indiscreet in these censorious days.

Results were satisfactory, and although this
season’s crushing will be light, the directors
considered another 12 p.e. div. justified,
shareholders have averaged 11 p.e. for the
past four terms, and with lean years thrown
in the outlook for something better than an
average of 8 p.e. is decidedly bright; the
co.’s cautious board—it is chaired by W.
Hamilton Hart, of the Q. N. Bank, and the
bank’s g.-m., M. G. Hayrnen, is managing-
director—is not likely to have decided on
12 p.e. until it had thoroughly riveted every
weak spot. Visible reserves were substan-
tial when the first 12 p.e. was paid; at June
30 last they were £185,045. That support
to the half-million of capital is helpful; total
funds have to earn 8| p.e. to cover the 12 p.e.
div. The task appears to be easier each suc-
ceeding term ; and this favorable growth sup-
plies part of the explanation :

Those figures are exclusive of investments —

stantial holding in the Bwndaberg Distillery
Co., which is understood to be doing well;
Millaquin received a bonus of £36,929 from
it in 1920. Fixed assets were in the books
at £465,725, a shade greater than in 1925,
but comparing well with the £481,955 of
1920. One marks those valuations as conser*
vative; but the market is mainly interested
in their profit-earning capacity, and that is
likely to remain satisfactory so long as the
electors of the Commonwealth are prepared
to give special Protection to an industry situ-
ated chiefly in one State. There is no likeli-
hood of an early change,’ although in Vic.
and S. Aus. strong opposition is developing
to the present arrangement in several of its
details. Latest sales on an ex-div. basis
have been at 245. 10-Jd; and that is about
as,high as the Wild Cat can remember. The
industry is susceptible to the influence of (a)
the union agitator; (b) an extremist-
dominated State Labor Government; (c) the
weather; and ( d ) the opinion of the Federal
electorate. They make an impressive list,
and the market plainly takes the fact into
account. For the current season the crop
will be low; probably 380,000 tons raw-
sugar for Queensland. Next season’s output
may be even smaller. But although Bunda-
berg is not likely to escape any general set-
back, a smaller crop (apart from a failure,
of course) is not so terrible now that normal
production is greatly above domestic necessi-
ties. Over a period of years the shares should
give a very decent return.

For the third time in five years the ordi-
naries had to be passed over. The cause
was entirely beyond the control of the co.’s
management. Under the influence of an
enormous crop of linseed in the Argentine
world prices of linseed-oil fell, and kept on
falling. Being so remote from its sources
of Supply—South America and India —the
co. has to maintain large stocks; and while
that means a good profit on a rising market,
on a falling market it means mischief, be-
cause the world’s price for the oil closely
follows the market value of the seed. Some
day perhaps, when the raw material is grown
on the spot, the co. may be able to eliminate
some of this speculative element ; at present
it just has to hope that what it loses this
year it will make good next year. Good
buying, of course, helps ; but weather is a
factor which cannot be foreseen. And as
costs are always under the microscope, there
isn’t much to be saved there when condi-
tions are unfavorable. Fortunately the
market is on its way up again, and that
recovery and a few gleams of promise in
other directions have brightened the outlook.
The growth of the stock foods department
and the almost certain development of the
iinoleum industry are items rich in promise.
Furthermore, with wool holding at highly-
profitable levels, scientific feeding of flocks
is receiving more attention, and that is help-
ing. When dry spells come, wool-growers
turn to this co.; but of late drought has been
conspicuous by its absence except in a belt
in Central Queensland. Meantime, however,
the co. has this knowledge at least: it has
educated the man on the land to the value of
scientific feeding, and there is a steady
growth of demand in normal times. As for
oil, margins last year were very narrow,
and the co. did well to emerge with the profit
disclosed. Gross profit was £58,585 as
against £74,604 for the previous term. The
Tariff Board has not yet been brought to
see the justice of the co.’s application for
increased Protection. It is not persuaded
that the co. cannot make a profit, although
it is hard to believe that it is for fun that
no dividend has been paid on ordinary shares
—representing the vast bulk of the capital
—in three out of the past five years, with
a mere 5 p.c. p.a. in the other two.
At May 31 stocks were heavy, the co.
having loaded a steamer from the Argentine
at a satisfactory figure just prior to the
close of the accounts. Liabilities, of course,

tors, £12,701 (increase, £6636). Although
substantial, all outside debt was well secured
by stocks and book debts. The small number
of pref. shares (20,000 each first and second)
are strongly situated : at May 31 there were
net tangibles with a book value of over £l3
per share for each first pref., and for the
seconds, which rank after the firsts, over £l2
per share. Their divs. also look safer than
most things. The management is not down-
hearted over the outlook, and it knows its
business. The market’s idea is that 9s. Id.
is the value of the ords., which isn’t very
flattering to the Tariff Board.

payment 5 p.c. into the 1924 term; they
now are owed 3 p.c. for 1924 and the full
8 p.c. for each of the past two years. Pro-
gress is slow, but the co. should make head-
way as the Windsor becomes more widely
known. (The hotel is the combined Grand
and White Hart, altered and modernised.)
Gross profit last year was £87,468; for the
previous term it was £85,022 and for 1924
£70,882. Something better than that is neces-
sary, of course, if ordinary shareholders
are to be given a meal within a reasonable
time. Thus far, prospects do not arouse
enthusiasm. 1 Competition in the field is keen,
and at least a couple of the competitors are
old-established and exceptionally well dug
in. Expenditure was pulled back last year
and that was satisfactory, for the increase in
the preceding years had been too robust.

the total represents 80 p.c. of the value
of the furniture and equipment originally
acquired. On the other hand, the co. has
now been operating for six years, and much
or the equipment in a high-class residential

debenture debt is £50,000; bank overdraft,

sufficient to cover the trade creditors; but
in a business of this kind that has no signifi-

Westralia broadcasts the news to anyone
wanting a gold-mine that it has over 4000
voided leases scattered over its old fields.
These abandoned blocks have produced about
4,500,000 tons of ore which gave an average
return of over 725. While some of them have
only been scratched others have been opened
to a depth of several hundred feet; a few
even deeper. Thrown up for various reasons
they are alleged to offer in many instances
good inducements for capital to come in. In
some cases their original owners are said to
have worked under difficult conditions and
to have only given up when funds were ex-
hausted, when crushing facilities were not
available or when machinery was required
to cope with water or follow the reefs down
to depths unattainable by hand-labor. The
vast improvement in conditions which have
taken place on most fields during the past
few years would, it is claimed, give anyone
who worked these shows a better chance of
success than formerly. There may sometimes
be something in this; but the theory has few
supporters locally.

The indestructibility of saturated wood is the
significant reason for the unsurpassed efficiency of
Pioneer Wood Pipe over a long period of time. Its
smooth bore gives no lodgment to encrustations and
fungus, and ensures delivery of full volume of pure,
uncontaminated water under all temperatures. Added
to this, its lightness and simplicity of installation
are advantages which strongly recommend Pioneer
Wood Pipe to progressive engineers. Send for the

P.O. Box 16 Camperdown, Sydney.
for the 300,000 ords. The parent co. receives
as part consideration £lO,OOO in cash
(already paid) and may take 200,000 shares
paid to ss. each in lieu of 50,000 shares
fully paid. The co. is to acquire the rights
to manufacture and sell in Australia the
Rapson tyre. It is aimed to win business
which at present goes to foreign makes. The
plant is to be in Tasmania, the Government
of the Speck having offered power at £13,000
p.a. which the co. estimates would cost at
least £45,000 p.a. in Victoria. The Govern-
ment also guarantees divs. on the prefs. for
a period of seven years, the guarantee to
operate practically from the commencement
of production (when 2000 tyres have been
produced). The quality of the Rapson tyre
is undoubted; estimates of capital expendi-
ture, costs and profits appear to have been
compiled with great care; and the board is
headed by Henry Jones, and includes Fred
Thonemann, Felix Lloyd (man.-dir. Buck-
ley and Nunn), J. W. Ferguson, 11. L. J.
Butler, formerly g.-m. of the English Rapson
co., and W. D. Bauld, a Melbourne motor-
man, so that management should be both
keen and solid enough. The issue has been
underwritten.

A Melbourne crowd headed by Tricks and
others are enthusiastic about the prospects
of the Corryong Syndicate, which holds an
option on some leases at Lake Le Page, near
the Kalgoorlie end of the East-West rail-
way. A director who recently took surface
samples at intervals of 40ft. over a length of
400 ft. claims to have got 2oz. to soz. assays.
A Bulletin man who was in that paht years
ago advises caution and the employment of
an independent expert of standing to inspect
and report.

Great Boulder’s profits now amount to
very little —last year’s were £2244 —and ore
reserves are steadily being rcdkuced. The
tonnage now in sight represents about
12- months’ supply for the mill, while the
grade is barely payable. At tine date of the
last balance the co. had £49,000 in hand, and
shares in the Carmen Valley and Wiluna.
Developments in the former, which is in
Columbia, are stated to be satisfactory;
prospects at Wiluna are “very favorable.”

According to chairman Collier, Lake View
and Star failed to fulfil expectations last
year. Costs at 28s. 7d. were up Gd. a ton,
despite a drop of sid. in treatment and 6^cl.
in general exes. To some extent the increase
was due to higher mining costs which were
the result of improving the working con-
ditions in the Ivanhoe section of the property.
Collier claims that the new plant, on which
£122,473 has been spent since 1922, is the
finest on the Kalgoorlie field, and when
further enlarged will defy local competition
as an economical ore treater.
* * * *
Last year an Adelaide crowd took an
option at £40,000 over the Radio lease, near
Southern Cross (W.A.). In view _ of the
small width of the Radio quartz veins, the
price looked big. Option-lLoldors installed
shaft-sinking machinery, sunk a shaft 90ft.,
opened the present bottom level, and then
abandoned the show. Since then the mine,
particularly at the bottom level, has been
developing better than ever, and it now
seems fairly certain that, had the £40,000
been paid, there would have been, at the
worst, not more cash lost than was ex-
pended by the option-holders during the cur-
rency of the option. What the Radio lacks
in volume is compensated for by gold con-
tent. With it.s £l5 per ton ore, it is the
one W.A. show that never turns out an un-
profitable yield. Some engineers appear
wedded to bulk, but, within reason, the propo-
sition that 1 ton of 3oz. ore is better than
6 tons of ioz. stuff holds gs>od. Viewed from
this angle,” the Radio mi glut have been worth
a trial even at £30,000 or £40,000.

J. T. Beckett is trying to induce the Fed-
eral Government to back his Tanami ven-
ture, the funds of the co. having been eaten
while the plant was being laboriously dragged
to the site. A. H. Stewart is still on the
field, and is making progress with battery
erection. No doubt the co. will find a way
out, even if it has to reconstruct.

N.T. Mica is sending its product to Sydney
to be cut and graded. John Sinclair, late of
the Commonwealth Mica Co., will operate
on the crude product to conform to world-
market requirements. The mine has got so
far ahead of the market that eight tons in
the rough have accumulated. Call No. 7 of
3d. is due, making the contribs. paid to
2s. 9d. —on a market below a shilling. Had
the commercial arrangements talked of early
in the co.’s history materialised shareholders’
pockets would have been spared all this.

Ajax’s good ore is rapidly petering out.
This Vic. co. has just done another six
months on the treadmill, getting through
with an admitted loss of £452. But it took
£5764 of gold tributors’ percentages, with
pyrites and dashed good work, to prevent a
bigger debit. At No. 4 level work south has
duffered. Now the co. will go north to pick
un any hidden trove there. The best ore has
come out of No. 5 level workings off the
crosscut south on the Victory lode, and a
fair quantity of quartz remains to be broken.
A flat make is to be re-visited to see if anyj
thing good was left behind between Nos. 5
and 6 levels, but it is a forlorn quest. In
the meantime the intermediate at No. 6 will
help keep the battery busy. The mine record
is the best on the field. On a capital of
£13,624 with £lOOO to promoters., it has shed
gold and pyrites worth £458,683. Oddments
bring the total receipts to £506,000. Of the
cash £149,437 went to shareholders, leaving
£223,594 for wages, £44,160 for fuel, £11,571
for plant, £38,421 for mine essentials and
£8445 for timber. Shares once sold at £B,
with Ballarat crazy over the field. Now they
are close to the dustbin.
* * * *
The chairman of North Mount Farrell
(Tas.) in the latest report says “the mine
itself has rarely looked better.'’ The late
manager says of No. S level: “The barren
portion of the lode instead of being 50ft. is
133 ft. in length”; and again, “the ore driven
through is not as rich as on No. 7.” This
points to a certain element of risk in the ore
to be expected from No. 9 level, which is
now being opened up. The responsibilities
of optimism are, of course, less in a chair-
man than in a manager, who is expected to
produce the goods.

Carpathia (N.S.W.) keeps to its average
fortnightly tonnage of 5 p.c. ore or there-
abouts. The past six weeks' crushiugs gave
a fraction under 18 tons dried concentrates
from 369 tons treated —easily the best of
any tin show in N. S. Wajes. The office
makes no pretence of telling why production
should continue on a dead level.
* * * *
Manna Hill, Stuart Town (N.S.W.),
speaks of being able to crush during this
month. For a start No. 1 tunnel from the
east stopc will supply fodder. No. 2 tunnel
carries a sprinkling of very fine gold.

New White Crystal, Ardlethan (N.S.W.),
has struck a 6d. call besides licking up an
overdraft guarantee of £l5OO by the direc-
tors. It is not for want of trying, for the
plant has run as high as 130 hours in a
week out of a possible 132 with three shifts,
and since May 8 has produced upwards of
20 tons of concentrates, worth above £3OOO.
In opening up the Crosby’s Hill ore a big
proportion of overburden had to be milled to
get it out of the way, but this stage has been
passed. The official estimate now gives from
1} to 5 p.c. and a face from 150 to 200
square feet. Mining and milling costs at
18s. a ton should be reduced, and the direc-
tors, by continuing the overdraft, will allow
the call money to go into development. About
two-thirds of the 150,000 10s. shares are
hibernating, however. Those who have paid
up have put in 7s. 5d., inclusive of the
current 6d. On 'Change the scrip is always
uncertain.
* * * *
Flagstone, Emmaville (N.S.W.), enters
the div. list with 6d. payable September 23.
McKenzie has not put much pressure on his
plant to date. Only 375 tons have been
crushed for 9i tons concentrates, but holders
are prepared to wait for bigger things. Pro-
duction shows that the tin is there, and the
co. should settle down to a prosperous career.
The syndicate controlling the Cornishman.
Herberton (N.Q.), has at last had a decent
return: £429 from 2 tons 6cwt. of concen-
trates, won from 23 tons of stone. There
had been a couple, of crushings previously,
and the latest places the syndicate on the
right side of the ledger.

Fred Brown, who is managing the Rare
Metals Co., Wolfram Camp (N.Q.), for the
Clive Cooper stable, announces that the
molybdenite plant is being erected, and will
be followed by the. wolfram and bismuth
concentrating plant and classifiers. In two
weeks nine tons of crushing ore were taken
out of the stope and sink on the tunnel lode.
* * * *
The Kawarau project (M.L.) has had an
easy first failure. With the closing of the
dam designed to keep Lake Wakatipu from
spilling over, Amalgamated .shares ran to
7s. 6d. The. Shotover and smaller streams,
however, continued to feed the Kawarau so
efficiently that no bed was bared for mining
operations, and then there was more activity
in share dealings—in the other direction.
Holders who were promised so much are now
informed that the Shotover will have to be
dammed, without any sufficient guarantee
that even this would mean a dry
Kawarau. Meantime the M.L. Government
finds a host of reasons why it can’t come
to the rescue with the taxpayers’ cash ; and
Sydney papers which talked in big type
about, a million-to-tlie-mile are loaded to
the muzzle with excuses why the millions
aren't forthcoming.

Waihi (M.L.) is to take over the Grand
Junction, finding the working capital and
halving profits with the Grand Junction
Prop. Waihi already has a crosscut from
its Edward reef at No. 1 level towards the
Junction west, boundary. Many years ago
the Junction did some work on the ore in
the area to which the crosscut is heading.
Old hands figured that the ore is a continua-
tion of the Waihi Welcome reef, but some
of the cute ones, arguing from the south-
westerly dip, reckon that it is the Martha
lode. The Junction Co. has 602 acres to the
south-west of the Martha hill, and in 1887
the old “A” shaft was put down 170 ft. in
the area near the patch now being in-
spected ; a drive of 820 ft. ran into an 18t't.
lode, but the values were low; in 1898 the
“B” shaft was sunk to pick up the winze
put in on the drive from the “A” hole; in
1906-07-08 more work was done, and in 1909
about 95 tons of ore from a stope at an
intermediate level on the “B” incline was
put into the battery, the values running
from 3s. 2d. to £1 335. 9d. per short ton.
A new diamond drill to poke in 1500 ft. is on
order, and one • way and another there is
some hope of striking the old formations —-
and resurrecting the old boom.
Timor Petroleum, of Melbourne, has re-
ceived a conservative report from Captain
Wrathall, its superintendent in Portuguese
Timor. He states that the seepages as sur-
face indications are excellent, that the geo-
logical structure is imperfect, and that he
is hopeful of reservoirs at a reasonable depth.
Drilling difficulties are certain to be met,
but not bad enough to endanger success.
Water for boring is scarce, there is plenty
of unskilled labor and the general living con-
ditions are good and healthy. Wrathall con-
cludes that “the concession is worth serious
attention and may prove of considerable
value.” Which is precisely what Dr. Wade
said in his report written several years ago.
After all, the drill is the sole arbiter whether
payable oil exists on Timor.
The Malay Siamese Co., representing the
interests of the Nawng Pet, Pliin Soon and
others, is floating the Haad Yai. The area
is 235 acres of leases and 1056 acres under
prospecting licenses. On 511 acres bored the
average was 1.271 b., the deepest wash 60ft.
and the highest values 12.211 b. The
22,000,000yd5. estimated should occupy the
intended 120, 000yds. dredge for 15 years, but
other portions of the leases will most likely
be brought in, as scout bores 50 chains east
from the picked area gave 16oz. Estimates
have been based on 60 tons oxide a month.
The co. will be in 200.000 20s. shares, of
which the parent will get 85,000 paids and
£70,000 in cash —the latter amount being to
pay for the dredge, which was ordered in
December and is said to be within two
months of delivery ; also for original purchase
money and cost of proving same. First call
on the 95,000 contribs. to be issued will be
the prerogative of the Malay Siamese holders.
The balance of 20,000 shares will be held in
reserve.

In his Malim Nawar prospectus, dated
August, 1923, Malcolm Newman stated that,
as to treatment methods, he strongly recom-
mended the installation of classifiers and jigs
in place of sluice-boxes. His brother-direc-
tors were not so positive as Newman, other-
wise Malim Nawar’s dredge would have been
ordered with jigs instead of being converted
later. No one is doubting the efficiency of
jigs and classifiers to-day. During August
the only three dredges so equipped produced
70 tons (Rawang), 63 tons (Takuapa) and
61 tons (Settlement). The question is
whether these dredges are digging ground of
exceptionally high values, or do the old type
of dredges lose half the tin.
The Bulolo rush in n.-e. New Guinea has
started yet another Sydney co. for testing
that alluvial field. It is called New Guinea
Gold and Exploration, with a capital of
£13,000 in 88,000 shares of 2s. 6d. Expert
assistants include A. Lindsay, geological sur-
veyor, who has lately been in the Territory;
R. B. Lewers and F. L. Thomas, mining
engineers; and E. Nolan, miner and prospec-
tor, who has been in New Guinea. Nothing
is said of proposed methods. If these are
to be the shovel and sluice-box familiar to
Papuan goldfields, they will call for a large
supply of native labor; and the local natives
are not dependable, while outside workers
from Papua, New Britain and other districts
are very hard to get. If hydraulic sluicing
is in view, inaccessibility will make transport
of heavy parcels a serious matter. The
miners of the old Papuan fields on the n.-e.
coast had to forego schemes for sluicing- and
dredging-plants for that reason. The fields
lay much lower than the Bulolo. even if they
were farther from the sea. and on both the
Yodda and the Gira were extraordinarily
rich; and cost would not have mattered, if
means of transport could have been found.
Still, that’s 20 years ago: and traction and
transport have seen some changes in that
time. The prospectus does not indicate that
the co. has thus far any options or title to
claims or country. So the co. is a gamble,
with another gamble beyond the first one.

The Antwerp diamond-cutting industry is
kept going these days by the Forminiere, in
the Belgian Congo, which now ranks the
world’s first iu cobalt and radium and third
in copper and diamonds, and is moving along
steadily in gold and tin. Fourteen thousand
natives produced 90,000 tons copper last year
against 30,000 tons by 12,000 natives five
years ago, evidence that the Belgian engi-
neers have greatly improved their machinery
and handling methods. Last year tin pro-
duction ran to 1500 tons, cobalt 200 tons,
diamonds 98,000 carats, and radium 20
grams. The Katanga railway carried
3,000,000 tons against 1,000,000 tons in
1923, and the mineral output was worth
830,000,000 francs. An official report esti-
mates gold production two years hence at
120,0000 z., reckoning on an extraction of
1000 tons a day from the Kilo-Moto reefs
and 200 tons daily from the Nizi lode.


THE MIRACLE OF THE LOAF AND FISHES.

MAIE (but she only thought this ): “Yes, and I’ll

“P.D.Q.”: Listeners-in on the commercial
wave-length a few nights ago at first caught
nothing but the babel of a dozen ships con-
tending for a circuit. Then there was a
momentary hush as a station was heard call-
ing Auckland for urgent medical assistance.
It turned out to be Puysegur Point Light-
house, luckily equipped with a wireless trans-
mitter. The wife of one of the lighthouse-
keepers was the patient for whom help was
required; and just as a doctor, hurriedly
summoned, reached the Auckland station, the
lady gave birth to a baby. Instructions and
diagnosis flashed backwards and forwards be-
tween the two stations, and the little story
ended happily with a voice proposing the
health of the child —a boy. Another instance
of what wireless is doing for the world.
“Spare f'orxi.”: I had forgotten that it
was the anniversary of Mont St. Quentin
when 1 heard a hail from a passing trolly;
I paused, recognising a face familiar in war-
time, and the driver jettisoned himself to
the pavement. Proud memories were burb-
ling in him, and we drank together. He had
been drafted from the Ist to the 2nd Division
to be near his brother, but they were in dif-
ferent battalions; and while Bill was with
the Diggers who captured the “impregnable”
Mont in the face of fierce opposition, Joe
was with reserves which subsequently “went
through,” and mopped up Peronne. "Bill
came over an’ said good-bye before they
moved forward,” Joe recalled. “ ‘You’ll want
flowers on your grave, Bill,’ I said to him,
‘an’ I guess I’ll want ’em, too, before long.
So long.’ When w T e moved up that night,
hanged if Bill doesn’t pass us, coming back,
walkin’ wounded” —the army description of
injured men able* to carry themselves out of
the line. “ ‘Hullo, Joe,’ he says. ‘We done
it,’ and passed on.” Can you picture any-
thing more typically Diggeresque than that
“‘Hullo, Joe,’ he says. ‘We done it,’ and
passed on”?

“Aroha” (M.L.) : Our company was at
Ferry Post when tin; Christmas billies were
handed out in 1915. On opening up, my
mate and I found we had both struck the
same address, and tossed up which should
write. He won. I met him two years after
on the Somme, and learned that he was regu-
larly corresponding with the billy girl, after
which I lost all trace of him. Last year he
and his wife and kiddie were among my fel-
low-passengers by service car from Te Kuiti
to New Plymouth (M.L.), and we naturally
began to talk over old times. I’d forgotten
all about the Christmas billies until I
.noticed the kiddie’s name was Fairy, which
somehow took me back to Ferry Post,. A
few cautious inquiries soon established that
Fairy’s mother was the billy girl; and a
very happy pair were she and her husband,
too. I’m still single, but have since won-
dered what would have happened had I won
the toss.

“The Listening-Insect”: “Grit for poultry,
£6 worth of shoes, one piano-player, one set
crepe-de-Chine lingerie, one pair silk brocade
corsets, one wedding ring, one aero-
plant flight and one suit of silk
pyjamas.” This isn’t a list of
articles subject to new duties. If
is a few of the presents showered
on the couple who won 3LO’s
(Melb.) competition for Septem-
ber’s most beauteous bride. Of
course self-advertisement was the
motive for all this benevolence, the
names of the donors being duly
broadcast all over the State. The
Anglican Archbishop was approach-
ed on the question of broadcasting
the marriage service, but John Har-
rington Melbourne put a damper
on the enthusiasts for Yankee-stunt
methods by declaring that, though
lie didn’t mind the etherising of
religious services, the wirelessing
of a sacred domestic ceremony was
mere cheap advertisement. Never-
theless, the deed was done from a
rival marriage-box. and those in-
terested heard the bride’s “I will.”
Next time they will perhaps catch
the young man in the act of pop-
ping the question; and a micro-
phone secreted in the maternity
ward later might provide matter
for an evening’s cultured entertain-
ment.

“Retired Volt”: The growth of

been amazing. Although devoted
bands still stand on windy corners

threepence in to make the bob. be-
hind that bit of cajolery big finan-
cial strings are pulled. The latest
enterprise is a “People’s Palace,”
Avliich is being erected in King-
street, Melbourne. It stands on the
site of a humble “model lodging-
house” which was bought by the
Army 30 years ago as a deadbeats’
shelter. Its eight-storeyed descen-
dant will contain 500 beds, spacious
lounges and a palm court, w-ill cost
£lOO.OOO, and \vill complete a chain
of Army hotels with at least one link in
every capital. That first bang of Booth’s big
drum certainly set up some remarkable rever-
berations.

“Barellau”: Some people may procure
christening water from the Jordan; others
have to take just what they can get. Last
Sunday a new public hall was opened in our
sou’-west (N.S.W.) district, and it was de-
cided to start it on its career with a com-
bined church service. One of the committee
took advantage of the ceremony to have his
first-born baptised; but the hall had only
been completed two days, and there had
been no rain to put any water in the tank.
Moreover, the nearest house was two miles
away. Neither the parson nor the parents
knew of the water difficulty, but it was sur-
mounted successfully. In three minutes we
had got the necessary out of the radiators of
the cockies’ cars that were standing outside;
and Jessie Margaret was duly launched.

small boy who can tell the make of a car by
its mudguards or thereabouts. Such a one,
a newsboy, brought a driver to book in a
Melbourne court the other day after the
guilty party had denied he was in any acci-
dent. Not only did the infant take an in-
telligent interest in the accident, but he had
noted the make of the car, and even jotted

That settled it.
“Black Magpie’’: Thank Heaven, some
people still have confidence in us! The
Mayor of a flourishing N. S. Wales coastal
town received the other day a cheque for
£lO 10s. with a request that it be employed
to stir up public interest and sympathy in
the movement for cancer research. His
Worship replied with a letter stating that, in
his opinion, such a movement was “unneces-
sary in our town, as Dr. [the township s
leading medico] is going to Sydney shortly,
and will look into the question himself.”
“Elsinore”: At an inquiry relative to the
popularity of labor-saving devices in America
it was discovered that the United States
lias more motor-cars than baths. A
census of domestic amenities taken in
450,000 houses in 35 American States
by the U.S. Federation of Women's Clubs
showed that out of every hundred 70 had
motor-cars about the premises, 68. were
equipped with telephones, 65 with indoor
sanitation, and only 59 with baths.

“Emel”: The vocational selection
referred to by "Bio” (B. 12/8/’26) is
carried on as a profession by at
one man in Melbourne. I inter-
viewed him i n
order to learn the
pleasantest and
easiest way in
which I could earn
a living. For the
sum of two guineas
I acquired a chart
wherein my char-
acter was mathe-
matically apprais-
ed in respect to
threescore different
instincts and traits,
and my appearance
described in more
detail than a pass-
port requires. At
the end of my
chart the gentle-
man advertises that
to any holder of a
similar document he
will, for one guinea,
supply a “guide to
marriage,” a form
“describing w r it li
scientific accuracy
and with about 50
details the appear-
ance and nature of
the type of person
whom you ought to
marry.” For a
similar sum one
may obtain a com-
plete “guide to
health.” all your
own private pit-
falls being clearly marked.
“Pons”: The Darwin (N.T.) doctor must
have raised an interested eye when Cobham
swooped down out of Asia last. month, for
he is something of a bird-man himself. His
snug little practice (1.8 patients to the
square mile) covers 10 times as much map
as Britain, with the disadvantage that roads
are bad and few, and apt, moreover, to
fade away whenever a bridge seems called
for. So the doctor has taken to the aerial
tracks, incidentally ending the old necessity
for urgent operations to be performed at the
far end of a telephone-wire _by palpitating
postmasters. The Inland Mission., too, has

plotted the district behind the sunset into
circular areas of 200-mile radius, each to be
patrolled by flying doctors. There is nothing
new in the idea. Lyautey’s surgeons, during
the 1921 French shindy in Morocco, could
whistle up 20 ambulance ’planes carrying
two stretchers apiece for the transport of
wounded, and the Swedish Red Cross runs
an air service under Government subsidy.
And as an up-to-date invitation to the ailing
to drop from the sky, a new hospital in South
America is to be finished off with a large
flat roof.

The “Studio” Model
WuRuIzER
And yet in spite of its diminutive size, the glorious tone and the excellence of workmanship that have
made Wurlitzer Player Pianos famous throughout the world have been retained.
The “Studio” Model Wurlitzer is only 4ft. lin. high, and 4ft. Sin. in length. It has a full 88-note
scale and will play any standard:-music roll.
Owners of cottages, fiat dwellers, etc., should inspect this glorious little instrument.

“Cablerk”: Having done night duty in
telegraph offices for many years, I was not
a bit surprised at the display of hooliganism
that marked a debate of Vic.’s State Parlia-
ment the other early morning. Four a.m.,
which is when the outbreak occurred, is the
zero hour of human vitality, and when vital-
ity is low the emotions take control. At
4 a.m. I have known a usually urbane man
throw an inkwell at a colleague because the
color of his hair distressed him. Another
was attacked with an inability to transmit
the letter “y.” When he saw a word with
a “y” coming he took a turn round
the office with sweat starting on liis brow.
Tn the daytime the letter didn’t trouble him.
The willingest fight I ever saw between erst-
while friends developed at IQ minutes past
(he zero hour; and it was at that time and
in a much warmer climate that a conscien-
tious officer, a shy man in the daytime, used
A GENTLEMAN EVEN AT
BREAKFAST.
“Joseph, you were talking in your sleep last
night.”
“Was I? Sorry I interrupted you, my dear.”
to strip and sit at his key in a state of un-
blushing nudity. He said it soothed his
nerves. By 6 a.m. all is well again, and
by 7 an office-full of boon companions
meets the day relieving staff with smiling
faces. Night work, as shown by error re-
turns, has a bad effect on accuracy. The
effect of night sessions on politicians seems
to be the same. It causes them to talk even
more loosely than usual about spending the
people’s money; to call inoffensive Speakers
“dirty old rascals,” and to otherwise behave,
in the absence of an audience in the gallery,
like ill-mannered children in the absence of
the nurse. Private businesses only give
night work to their employees when they
have to. Why the handsomely-paid politi-
cian is allowed to mess around with the coun-
try’s business in the small hours of the morn-
ing is a sanguinary mystery.
HER CHOICE, TOO.
MOTHER: "Now, remember, my dear, have nothing to do with men who talk about
kissing.”
FLAPPER DAUGHTER: “Bet y’ life, Mum. Give me th' John who does it ’nd no ques-
tions asked.”
“Mars”: No artisan of my acquaintance
lias more pride in his work than Jones, our
village undertaker. Only the other day I
found him in reminiscent vein, reviewing-
various incidents which had happened dur-
ing his long professional regime. “The worst
thing I can remember,” he said, “is old Jim
Green’s funeral. When we went to lower
the coffin we found the grave was Gin. too
short. Of course it had to be lengthened
before we could go on with the job. A thing
like that,” he concluded plaintively, “takes
all the enjoyment out of a funeral for every-
body.”
* * * *
“Pink Tape”: That tedious spectre the
Sunday Observance Act, made law in the
reign of Charles 11.. walked the County
Court in Melbourne the other day when the
Ford Estates Proprietary, Ltd., sued an old
woman for the balance of payments on a
piece of land. The contract having been
signed on the Sabbath, the defendant claimed
it was illegal. Plaintiffs won tbeir case, not,
however, because the Judge regarded the
ghost of Charles 11. as out of season, but
because a Victorian decision in 1882 held
that a land-agent was not a tradesman
within the meaning of the Act, and was
therefore not barred from doing a little job
on the seventh day.
“FlHgwagger’’: When early in 1915 our
ifnit: was encamped at Broadmeudows many
spent Saturday afternoons washing clothes.
Others, whose homes were in Melbourne,
took or sent theirs home. The exception was
Misery; I don’t know it' it: will be believed,
lnit it ugis a solemn fact, that his wife brought
her clothes to him to wash. She. was a big
woman with a voice to match, and he once
admitted to me that it was she who drove
him to the recruiting depot because he was
unemployed. She would arrive, every Satur-
day with a bag of clothing, and after collect-
ing and examining Misery’s work for the
previous week (collecting also his pay if he
liad received any) she would lecture him and
depart. Misery could always rely on plenty
of encouragement and advice while he per-
formed his task. He never hung out the
washing in daylight, but did the job before
Lights Out, collecting it again before
Reveille. And now for the sequel.
Taking my weekly parcel of shirts and col-
lars to the Chinese laundry some time after
my return to Aussie, I saw a new establish-
ment across the road with a sign reading
“Digger Laundry,” and decided to transfer
my custom. A minute later 1 was gripping
Misery by the hand. But what a change!
His old name no longer fitted him ; he was
bubbling over with happiness. Presently I
learned the reason why. After he had re-
turned from the war and handed over his
deferred pay, his wife had informed him that
she had found another and more suitable
mate. He had accepted the decision philoso-
phically ; also he had worked and saved, had
opened the laundry, and was doing well. So
his conjugal training came in valuable, after
all.

“M.G.S.”: The person who walked off
with Sir David Wilkie’s picture, “The Gentle
Shephprd,” from
Melbourne National
Gallery was either
an undiscriminat-
ing thief or one
moved by obscure
motives. Anyhow,
he passed over at
least a score more
valuable and quite
a thousand better
painted. Which re-
calls that the
Italian workman
who stole the Mona
Lisa from the
Louvre was patri-
otically attempting
to repair the wrong-
done to Italy, the
original owner, by
that super-burglar
Bonaparte. The
Italian Govern-
ment, having some
misbegotten art
treasures of its
own, allowed the
picture to go back;
but when I visited
the Louvre six
years later the
French authorities
were still horribly
nervy about it.
T here were so
many of the staff
of attendants clus-
tered round Leon-
ardo’s lady with
the haunting eyes
that I seriously
considered walking-
off with the Venus
de Milo, only she looked a trifle heavy.
“X.N.0.”: I suspect that many officers
and men of the recently-returned Melbourne
learned for the first time of the “almost
mutiny” aboard their ship when they read
the account of it in a Sydney Sunday paper.
The trouble was attributed to putrid meat.
Having witnessed and taken a hand in a few
similar incidents, I can imagine the circum-
stances. By accident —inevitable sometimes
—a bad carcase gets into the freezing-room,
and after tainting a few other carcases passes
unobserved and finds its way to the stokers’
messes. A sailor likes nothing so much as
a grievance, and the result is a visit to the
quarter-deck with a “complaint.” A scep-
tical officer of the watch tregts the matter
too lightly, and full satisfaction is not given.
Result: “Blowed if I’ll go below till I get
a decent meal.” Further result, friction
with the regulating stoker petty-officer
and a bit of a shindy, ending in a further
visit to the quarter-deck and a couple of cell
sentences, subsequently “washed out” when
it is found that there really was something
wrong with the meat. The present tale re-
lates that scrambled eggs and bacon made
their appearance next day as a sort of
amende honorable. As men-of-war haven’t
space to stow many eggs for such emer-
gency purposes, I shouldn’t wonder if those
scrambled eggs were made with egg-powder.

“Miro”: My most cherished sign-memory
is one we struck when we put up for a night
at a semi-religious hostel in a M.L. town.
Adorning the wall were sundry texts, and
one placard which read: “Visitors to this
hostel shall not look out of the windows in
dressing-gowns.” It suggested possibilities,
but we did not wait to test them.

“Iford” : If Byron could return, I wonder
how the isles of Greece would strike him
nowadays. Think of some of the history
made in Athens since the first Balkan war
in 1912. A king deposed, recalled and de-
posed again; another fatally bitten by a
monkey, a third installed and deposed in his
turn, a whole Ministry stacked up against
a wall and shot for no reason except that
the army had been walloped by the Turk in
Asia Minor, a republic declared, and a whirl
of Presidents and Dictators chasing one an-
other about the landscape. Also a Parlia-
ment where doves were loosed as symbolic
of the peaceful time Greece was going to
have after getting rid of its imported Royal
house, and a Government that finds time
between revolutions to try to regulate the
length of women’s skirts. Yet through it
all the Greek that Australian cities are fami-
liar with continues to serve the fish and chips
and open the oyster as if he only retained

FIFI: “Oh, two detectives helped me.”
the mildest interest in his kaleidoscopic coun-
try. I can remember a period when most
Greek restaurateurs displayed a picture of
either King Tino or Venizelos to indicate
which way their sympathies went, but both
of these celebrities seem to have been
scrapped, and to have left no successors.
HE FELL AMONG THIEVES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Accused said he was on his way home when lie
saw a mob of blokes playing two-up. As he had lost
at the races he thought he might get back some of
his losses. He put five shillings on tails and won,
but was refused payment. Seeing the game was
crook, he went crook himself. Then he was
knocked down and the mob ran.”
Of quids he’d splashed a few up
Where Ikes their victims chew up;
He’d blued his jack,
And bleak and black
His thoughts along the homeward track,
When suddenly he drew up.
Beside the road
There ebbed and flowed
A mob of blokes at two-up.
New hopes his heart upsprung' in.
Quoth he: “Good brass I’ve flung in
The bookies’ bags
On nobbled nags,
But here's a game with no such snags
Or chance of being stung in.
The browns in air
Spin true and fair,
A stake or two I’ll bung.in.”
“Room for another scholar?”
One hears him blithely holler.
With cheerful grin
They let him in
Their school. He watched the coins a-spin
And shouted “Tails a dollar]”
And tails they lay, '
But pay ?—not they !
It fairly roused his choler.
Cruel Fate! He couldn’t brook her
Last stroke. He shouted “Rooker 1”
In sudden ire.
’Twas something dire
To fall into the two-up fire
From out the racing cooker.
“You beat the books,”
He yelled, “as crooks.”
But when that school disbanded —'Zooks!
There’s one they left was crooker.

A SONG OP SPRINGTIME,
[For The Bulletin.]
“By our calendar spring began on September 1.”
’Tis springtime by the watch (vide above
Official item), and the season’s turn.
“A livelier iris on the burnished dove”
Already may poetic eyes discern.
And other things there are wherefrom to learn
That winter into winter-quarters flops.
One sign, and one alone, still lags astern:
Where are the snow-white helmets of the cops ?
Their way from wakening earth the flowers shove;
Soon shall be glint of gold ’mid green of fern,
Soft whispers in the parks, and vows of love
Exchanged from mobile lips in tones that burn.
The butter groweth yellower in the churn,
The tender lambs must die to give us chops.
Spring’s here, no doubt. But I have yet to learn
Where is the vernal headgear of the cops.
My lady’s toying with a lighter glove;
Her seal and musquash mighty soon she’ll spurn.
All male creation’s livelier, from the Gov.
(So I suspect) down to the myall kern.
For whisky fewer every day adjourn
To pubs or clubs, and more for malt and bops,
But where, I ask with genuine concern —
Where are the solar helmets for the cops?
Envoy.
Their keep the window-dressers still shall earn
Displaying vernal garments in the shops.
I’ve seen the first wistaria. Now I yearn
To glimpse the snowy helmets on the cops.

With John Gunn’s retirement there are
now five S. Aus. ex-Premiers living—Dr.
Coekburn, now in London (76), John Ver-
ran (70). Crawford Vaughan (52), Bar-
well (40) and Gunn (40).
“ Hurtle . how ever did you manage to yet in

“Couldn’t shay no on Refrendum Day, my

An event of the week has been the appear-
ance of a certain wholly unexpected Lowen-
stein (Captain Alfred Lowenstein, by latest
advices), who offered to lend the Belgian
Government £10,000,000 (or perhaps francs)
without interest. Lowenstein transpired by
cable along with the Mexican religious war
and the latest U.S. drink horrors. The
mystic millionaire is said to conduct his
operations, not in any big city, but at Biar-
ritz. a watering-place in the south of France
and handy to the Spanish border. His busi-
ness retinue fills seven villas, and he has
four aeroplanes which carry his agents to
and fro making money for him. C. .T. de
Garis had only. one. The source of his wealth
is so secret that even the income-tax collec-
tor doesn’t know; but it is thought that
Loweustein may be proprietor of a chain of
anonymous papers.
Thursday Island put up another record
the other day when Joseph Lui, a Torres
Strait islander, ministered as priest in the
cathedral there. The Archbishop of Bris-
bane was one of the members of the Euro-
pean congregation. Bui’s father was a
Loyalty Islander, and came over in the early
days of pearling, but his mother was a full-
blood Murray Islander.
i Australia's old friend Sir Gerald Strick-
land —he was Governor of Tasmania, W.A.
and N. S. Wales in succession between 1004
and 1017 —has taken for his second wife a
lady with two or three millions of her own.
Sir Gerald’s first wife, an earl’s daughter,
died m 1018. The ex-Gov. at 65 is still an
assertive person with strong views on most
subjects, which he ventilates impartially in
the House of Commons and the Maltese
Assembly. Fluency and combativeness are
both family traits; it is claimed that seven
generations of the Strickland clan repre-
sented Westmoreland from the first English
Parliament till the reign of Elizabeth, and
that a remote ancestor, Thomas Strickland,
bore the banner of St. George at Agincourt.
“Old Parliamentary Hand": During his
32 years' membership of Vic. Assembly
Speaker Bowser has never witnessed any-
thing worse than the uproar that broke loose
on the Labor Opposition side of the House
when, after an all-night sitting, he proceeded
to put the motion for the adoption of the new
(guillotine) standing order to curtail talk.
Insulting epithets were hurled at Bowser
by Solly and some of his colleagues, and
for a few moments it looked as if there would
be an exhibition of violence. Before Bowser
became a member there were scenes quite
as exciting, as when a troublesome interjcctor
was silenced by having a bulky volume of
Hansard hurled at him across the table,
and when ex-Premier Shiels, pointing at
Premier J. B. Patterson, hissed something
that sounded like “You coward!” Shiels,
when the din died down, explained that he
was interrupted as he was saying “You
cowered before the blast of public opinion,”
and the man wim threw the book assured
members that it was the “velocity” of his
body as he “swept” around from a western
to a northern frontage that caused the fat
book from which he was quoting to fly out
of his hands.
John Shore, of Hobart, who cast a vote on
the referendum issues, was, so it is claimed,
104 years of age—probably the oldest voter
in . the Commonwealth. He refused all
assistance as, without the aid of glasses, he
marked his ballot-paper.
Eggleston, Vic. Attorney-General, is getting
absent-minded. He walked into the sacred
chamber the other day with his pipe in his
mouth. Of course, the Assembly, which is
composed entirely of Chesterfields, howled at
him, and the Law Minister buried his face
in the sand.
Tom Skcyhill, once the blind signaller,
who, after Gallipoli, found out in Australia
that 1m could talk, is still busy doing it in
the U.S.A. There are professional lecturers
there by the hundred, and he is now easily
one of the best known of them. He lately
spent five months in Italy studying new con-
ditions at first hand, so his repertoire has
had added to it “With Mussolini and the
Blackshirts.” In between times he writes,
and a couple of his plays, “Moon Madness”
and “Unknown,” have been taken for pro-
duction on Broadway this autumn. Finally
by way of recognising his great fight for sclf-
education, Ohio University lately gave him
an honorary degree.
Group-Captain Williams, who will pilot
the first big Pacific flight hatched in
this country, was a pioneer Australian air-
man. He commanded the first Australian
Air Squadron, which did such good work in
Palestine, and finished up in charge of the
whole Palestine brigade of the Royal Air
Force. When war died down lie got more
experience as this country’s aviation staff-
officer in London and spent a year at the
British Staff College at Camberley. The
machine that is to carry him the 14,000
miles between Sydney and Samoa and back
again is similar to Cobham’s, but will have
the more leisurely Siddeley-Puma engine of
240h.p. to push it.
“Uramao”: Maoriland’s Timi Kara( James
Carroll) was the central personage in a
great gathering of native tribes and pakeha
friends the other day. when he celebrated
his 69th birthday. Little is heard of Timi
since he went out of active politics and joined
the lotus-eaters of the Uppah House. On one
occasion, while Minister, he was cruising
round the Auckland coast in the Tutanekai
with the Governor, Lord Ranfurly. A grizzled
old native named Hori Kukutai was a guest
aboard. When passing Cape Reinga, the
jumping-off place to the happy hunting-
grounds of the spirits of defunct Maoris,
Hori got the notion that his ancestors were
calling him, and in order to appease them
he threw overboard his watch and chain.
Doubtful whether this had satisfied them
Hori then tried to jump over himself. It
was then that Carroll was brought on the
scene. He told Hori he was the guest of the
Governor and that spirits who could worry
him at such a time deserved no consideration.
Finally he took the old man down to his own
cabin and left him there apparently con-
vinced ot the bad nature of the spirits,' When
Carroll returned he found Hori more com-
placent. He had gathered up Timi Kara’s best
clothes and thrust them through the porthole
to give the spirits something to go on with.
Willie Philp, who number-oned the
Toowoomba team to victory in the Queens-
land polo tournament, is a giddy young
thing of 60. He is a brother of that E.
Philp whose feat of covering 83 miles on
one horse in 12 hours is among baekblock
Australia’s most cherished records.
LANCELOT STIRLING. Australia's oldest
active politician and one of its best
sportsmen. He has been in Parlia-
ment 45 years, and for most of
the time has been President of
the Leg. Council. Though born at
Strathalbyn (S.A.), where he still lives,
he represented Cambridge in the inter-
University sports 56 years ago, and was
the champion hurdler of England that
year. He has been master of the Adelaide
Hounds and captain of a polo team, and
lias played almost every game ever
invented.
Fayal, in the Azores, the extinct volcano
which recently got into the cables by reason
of a calamitous earthquake, has, or should
have, some interest for Australians, for it
was there that Adam Lindsay Gordon was
born in 1833. At least Marcus Clarke said
so in his preface to Gordon’s poems,
and it was one of the few statements of
Clarke’s about Gordon’s early life that hasn’t
been questioned or wrangled about by later
biographers.
Wonderfully careful of the bawbees was St.
Joseph’s College accountant Brother Augus-
tine McDonald, who passed out the other day.
Just before his death lie received an account
for £4O from a Sydney firm. He at once
sent along .a cheque for the amount, and
next day, forgetting lie had done so, sent
along a second cheque. The firm returned
the second cheque; but that didn’t make
moch difference to the old Scot. “Send for
the priest,” he said, “and let me make my
will!” He died within a fortnight.
The flight for life staged with Andrew
Brooks as its beneficiary failed to defeat the
death which had hovered by his bedside since
he fell 70 feet down a mine-shaft at Broken
Hill in November, 1924. With a fractured
spine, Brooks lay paralysed in hospital at
Broken Hill, getting no better but lingering
on, until in May last it was decided to carry
him to Sydney for treatment. He was taken
by aeroplane to Cootamundra, after which
lie had to face 300. miles of train travelling.
Leaving* Broken Hill on a Tuesday morning
he was landed at Sydney at 5 a.m. next
day. His case, however, proved hopeless
and he died lately at the Coast Hospital.
Algernon 11. Undo, who died suddenly at
Woollahra (Sydney) the other day, was a
composer and writer who had travelled the
world as examiner for the Associated Board
of the Royal Academy of Music and the
Royal College of Music. After visiting this
country several times he decided to make it
his home when, three years ago, he found it
well to give up travelling. The newly-created
Conservatorium job of teacher of accompany-
ing, which he was to have filled, now falls
vacant.
Mrs. Ellen Kinsela is dead ; and perhaps
you don’t know her. She was a daughter-
in-law of the Charles Kinsela who started,
in the reign of tiie fourth George, the oldest
and for a kmg time the best known funeral
business in Australia. Her husband, who
inherited the business from its founder, died
in 1900, and for 14 years, before transfer-
ring it to her sons, the lady carried on. It
is still quite a prosperous concern.
William Neill, who was. born in Adelaide
when it was mainly North-terrace and
Hindley-street, with red coats of the British
garrison parading and blackfellows holding
corroborees down by the river, had an 80th
birthday-party last week. He was in the
first public examination held in S.A.. along
with the late Prof. Stirling and John Dow-
ner, and at 12 he was in the National Bank.
From 1887 to 1898 he was the Federal
Bank’s first and only local manager. When
it went down in the Melbourne smash, he
started afresh and worked up an accoun-
tancy business. He had—and has —a keen
eye. In 1914, when Commonwealth bank-
notes were first issued, he spotted in them
some non-compliance with the Act that, when
hastily brought under the notice of Primini-
ster Fisher, caused a validating bill to be
rushed through the Federal Parliament in
one day.
The last cable-tram to run along Chapel-
street, Melbourne, before the line was con-
verted to electric traction was driven by
gripman Charles Smith, who also held the
joystick of one of the first trams to carry
passengers when the route was opened in
1888.
Still another pedagogue to qualify for the
six-and-eight brigade is Vincent J. Brady,
lately master of English at Fort-street High
(Sydney). Doing his strenuous bit during
the war he collected Uncle Sam’s V.C. —the
Distinguished Service Cross, which also has
inscribed on it “For Valor.” This piece of
gilt he acquired for gallantry in an artillery
display on the Selle River in 1918. Still on
life’s sunny side, he is holding out his brass
plate in Sydney.
Jimmy Beban (M.L.) was unknown to
fame until he got 34 brawny gentlemen to
join him in cutting a tunnel between Lake
Coleridge and a power-house that sat on
the other side of a thick hill. . The hole
had to be made to provide Christchurch and
other Canterbury towns with more of the
electric current for which they have had a
tiger-that-has-tasted-blood appetite ever since
the lake was harnessed in 1912. Beban and
his mates waded into the job two years
ago and struck trouble right away. They
found the hill a well-soaked sponge of water.
The Public Works engineers decreed a
deviation to dodge the water, but though
the new route was a bit dryer there
was a land-slide that entombed several
men, and the co-operative party had to work
like mad to get them out alive. When the
job was finished and the party got its final
payment the other day, the members reckoned
that Beban was underpaid in the distribu-
tion. They remedied that by handing him
a cheque for £B50 —and they were working-
men, mostly married and with kids to sup-
port !
Macrossan, Queensland’s newest Judge, has
no time for the fiction that there is a tre-
mendous amount of intellectuality in crime.
Recently he had before him three men who
had made a clumsy and half-hearted attempt
to break into a jeweller’s shop in broad day-
light, under the
eyes of passers-by.
When the youthful
Crown Prosecutor,
.T. A. Slieehy, de-
scribed one of the
trio as “the master-
mind,” the Judge
boiled over.
“Master-mind!" he
snorted. “Why, the
whole affair was in-
credibly stupid !”

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“During the debate on the Queensland Salary
Oral), the Premier remarked that, as Treasurer and
leader ot' the (Government party, he was prepared to
take full responsibility for the increase, and if the
necessity arose he would take the responsibility for
decreasing members’ salaries as well as other
people’s.’’
I dreamed they had returned again,
Those good old days of yore
Ere h.c.l. had come to pain
A world bled white by war,
And shillings two sufficed to do
The work to-day of four.
My butcher cut a juicy pound
Of steak and asked a sprat;
Just seven-and-six would buy, I found,
An admirable hat,
And there were drops in all the shops
Upon a scale like that.
A quid the best of racquets cost,
The best of bats a quid;
A tanner on the bar you tossed
In payment for a tid.
Towai'd you Bung the bottle swung
Just as of old he did.
Alluring boots and shoes were priced
At twelve-and-nine a pair;
A traybit for a shave sufficed,
A zack would clip your hair
And bring you store of turfy lore
In any barber’s chair.
I bought a paper, so I dreamed,
And idly scanned the page
Where half a dozen headlines screamed,
Attention to engage:
“Gold Circulates through all the States.”
“Fall in the Basic Wage.”
“Decrease in Parliamentary Pay
About to be Decreed
From Queensland round to W.A.—
McCormack Gives a Lead.”
And then I knew (and wouldn’t you ?)
My dream was mad indeed.

A lOZ DIVIDEND
PLUS
CUMULATIVE VALUE!
If you have money to invest now, don’t miss this wonderful opportunity. If you have small-interest
bearing bonds sell them and put the money into more profitable use. To-day you are offered
shares at par in an industry absolutely vital to Australia —in an industry that is actually in full swing
—adequately protected by a tariff—in an industry whose product is preferred to the imported article
and for which there is a demand five times greater than the mill is now producing. Similar industries
in England have paid millions in dividends. There is only one mill of the kind in Australia.
DAVYS PROPRIETARY LIMITED
PIONEERS IN AUSTRALIA OF THE SEWING COTTON AND LINEN THREAD INDUSTRY.
Capital £250,000
The company has issued a prospectus offering
1 00,000 ordinary shares of £1 each for public
subscription at par, payable as follows:
On application, 5/- per share.
On allotment, 5/- per share.
Balance in calls of 2/6 per share at intervals
of not less than one month; or, alternately,
shares may be paid for in full.
Davys Proprietary, Limited, established Australia s first and only Sewing Cotton and Linen Thread mill
at Waterloo. To-day it is producing all the different kinds and qualities of threads required by scores of
manufacturing industries. The production of these essential threads represents a FCEY INDUSTRY in
the fullest sense and also represents a most profi able field for the investing public. The additional
capital is required for immediate expansion.
SECURITY.
All subscribed Capital is immediately put into one of the four uses
mentioned under “Objects of Present Issue” in the full Prospectus,
the bulk of which represents tangible assets. When the Shares now
offered for public subscription are fully paid, the surplus of Assets
over Liabilities will be approximately £200,000.
A KEY INDUSTRY.
Evidence submitted to the Tariff Board resulted in the Federal
Parliament viewing this new industry as vital to Australia. A tariff
of from 25 per cent, to 35. per cent, was granted to protect it from
outside attack.
THE DEMAND.
Approximately £750,000 worth of threads is annually used by
Australian manufacturers. There is a definite preference in favor of
the local product, because the long sea voyage affects tensile strength
of imported threads. The local mill will enable adequate stocks to
be carried and all orders to be executed immediately. The mill
to-day produces only 1-sth of the demand. The market is waiting
for the duplication of the mill.
Copies of the full prospectus and forms of applica-
tion can be obtained from the Secretary of the
Company, 26-30 Clarence Street, Sydney. ( 1 ele-
phone B.W. 6435.)
Personal inquiries may be made at 26-30 Clarence
Street, Sydney.
PROFITS.
The estimated annual profits accruing to this Company are equivalent
to a return of 1 9 per cent, per annum. As overhead expenses will
not increase in proportion to the greater output, it is confidently
anticipated that the Company will be in a position to pay a dividend
of not less than 10 per cent., and make such substantial provision
for reserves as to make its position unassailable.
THE FACTORY.
The factory is situated at Elizabeth Street, Waterloo, and has been
specially designed for the needs of the industry. There is sufficient
space to permit duplication of the present plant, as now proposed,
and for which additional capital is now sought. The mill is self-
contained and replete with up-to-date dyeing, bleaching and mercer-
ising plant, enabling the production of every kind of sewing cotton
and thread required by Australian manufacturers.
COMPETITION.
There is no other Sewing Cotton and Linen Thread mill in Australia
or New Zealand. With the tariff protection and the preference for
the Australian product there is absolutely no reason why this factory
should not supply the whole of the thread requirements of Australian
manufacturers. The industry is being sanely guided by a particular!}'
strong directorate with special technical, financial and administrative
ability. An opportunity such as is offered to the investor by this
Company occurs but rarely in a lifetime.

“Bioko": Surely “Hiawatha” (B. 8/7/’26)
must be attempting to break records with his
plough since he has failed to find the origin
of the network of webs that appears on a
field shortly after it has been upturned. If
he will stop and w r atch for three minutes
he Avill notice that the web is woven by
myriads of tiny spiders. I have often seen
them at the job.
* * * *
“Larrapinta”: In case other abo. ski-
makers have struck the same trouble as
“Bad Australian” (B. 5/8/ ? 26), whose ski-
toes refused to stay curved, let me offer
them some advice. Soak the part of the
toe to be bent in clean rain-water for a week.
Make a wooden template as wide as the ski,
with about a 3in. greater curve than is
required. On a
good charcoal or
coke fire place a
sheet of iron cov-
ered with 3in. of
dry sand. Stir the
sand round till it is
thoroughly hot:
then place the ski-
toe in the sand,.and
keep it there until
it ceases to steam.
Ne'xt, place it on
the curved template
and force it down
with a heavy
weight or a couple
of joiner’s cramps
to fit the curve.
Leave it for a week
to dry, then take it
out and give the
bent part at least
six coats of raw
linseed oil, allow-
ing each coat to
soak well in before
applying the next.
Should the wood
show a tendency to
straighten, fasten
the toe back with
a wire twitch from
the clip mortise to
the point of the
toe, until after the
oil has been
applied. The bend
will then be per-
manent.
“Billball”: Skis
made from woolly-
butt do not
straighten out (B.
5/8/’26) and are
much more ser-
viceable than im-
ported ones. Those
I am using have
had solid wear for
five years and are
still in good condi-
tion. They were
made at Harrietville (Vie.), of local timber,
the cost being about 30s.
* * * *
“Wart”: When he travelled through the
Speck “Doric” (B. 5/7/’26) must have done
so with his ears dulled if Waddamanna and
Miena were the only two native place-names
he came across. Practically all names added
to the Tassie map of late years have been
taken from the vocabulary of the passed-out
blacks. Some places, like Exeter (now
Tatana) and Snake Banks (now Powranna),
had their nomenclature changed despite the
indignation of the oldest inhabitants. Per-
haps the only district which has throughout
kept its native appellation is Ringarooma, on
the east coast. Others, like Matliinna and
Moorina, were named after some of the last,
of the blacks. Conara (magpie) and Legato a

’ORACE: "No, I dunno Jones from a bar o’ soap.”
'ERB : “Never met either of 'em, I suppose.”
(fresh water) and others of the kind have
been given because they were appropriate to
the district. Macquarie inflicted dozens of
districts with Scotch appellations. Again, a
convict overseer, who apparently carried
copies of the “Arabian Nights” and a Bible
with him, was responsible for the Speck’s
Bagdad, Jericho, Jerusalem, Jordan,
Dromedary, etc. Patterson, in honor of Gov.
King, gave us Launceston, Tamar and other
Cornish signposts. Brady’s Lookout, Lemon’s
Lagoon and other names perpetuate memories
of the bushranging days.
“Wart”: In the case of “ Jesmond’s” T.B.
patient (B. 5/8/’26), the “growth” in bed
is not necessarily associated with the dis-
ease. In the old days, when recruiting-
sergeants were paid by results, the English
Army got many a recruit who was an inch
or two under the regulation height. When
a sergeant found that a prospective, victim
just failed to pass the height test the would-
be soldier-boy was put to bed for a few days
and then rushed to the examining officer be-
fore his joints had time to set close again.
* ** * *
“Herodot” : Concerning the faculty seem-
ingly possessed by animals of being able to
perceive things hidden from human beings
(B. 22/7/’26). There is a spot in the lonely
country between Ivillarney (Q.)
and the N.'S.W. border which is
noted for the effect it produces
on them, although to the human
eye there is nothing in it differ-
ent from any other place. It
consists of a depression in a
back road, and a horse or other
animal entering it generally
manifests symptoms of uneasi-
ness. A grazier in that locality
told me that on one occasion he
had practically to flog through
it an otherwise quiet and tract-
able horse. On another occa-
sion a dog accompanying him
whined and showed reluctance
to go through the dip, and when
eventually it did go it was at
top speed and without stopping
till the other side was reached.
Even the bullocks in a team
have been known to behave
strangely on coming to the
place, drawing back and tossing
their heads until forced into the
dip, when they broke into a jog-
trot and kept it up the whoJ» way through.
* * * *
“Really”: While shooting in a small
lagoon off the Murray I saw an astonishing
sight. Fully 40 cormorants were spread
across the lagoon and were driving the fish
into the shallow water at the end. The birds
were extended, at nearly equal distances,
about two yards apart, and advanced prac-
tically in line. I waited until they were close
in to the shore and had started feeding be-
fore I fired, and they flew away, allowing the
fish to swim back to safety.
“Larrapinta”: The miners referred to by
“Pick” (B. 5/8/’26) did themselves a bad
turn financially when they broke up the
shale fossil of an outsize in gecko lizards.
Had they railed it to the Sydney Museum
they would probably have been amply
rewarded. There must be thousands of speci-
mens and curios in Australia on mantel-
pieces and in lumber-rooms that would
enrich our public collections. Two instances
I can name. One was the case of a S.A.
cocky who used a beautiful greenstone Maori
mere club as a doorstep, until I obtained it
in exchange for a tin of honey. The other
instance was that of an Adelaide man who
threw a collection of jasper, flint and bottle-
glass spearheads his father had brought
from the Kimberley district (W.A.) on to
his front footpath. I picked up nearly
200 of them still undamaged from the sides
of the path. I was told by the owner I
could keep them, but at auction they would
probably have fetched at least £5O. When
I cross the great divide the ton or so of
native weapons and curios I’ve collected in
my travels is going into the Adelaide
Museum.
“Hepatic”: The following letter has a
double interest, one of form and the other
of substance. Gallstones are occasionally
recovered here (W.A.) from the gall blad-
ders of cattle. They are sold locally to
Chinamen, and bring from ss. up to £2 10s.,
according to size. Approximately the market
value is £5O per pound weight. I understand
that these stones are dried, crushed and

respondent is an Indian, and writes -
I want to ask you one thing, that is in your
abattair you are killing manys a cattles, in the
cattle’s lever there is a water bag. In the bag there
is hanging some stones. It would be in some cattles
only, not in all, please note that. If you dry that

called “Coll stone.” You please try to collect all
the stones and send it to me. For that I will send

WOOL FOR OVERSEAS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Trams are passing up and down the whole day long,
Grinding wheels and screeching rails and clanging
gong,
How they rattle, sway and shake,
When they feel the jarring brake,
Singing noisily their harsh, metallic song:
“There are lorry-loads of wool ahead for ports beyond
the seas;
There are steamers lying waiting for their cargoes
at the quays.
Do the names of English counties, and their cities
and their towns,
Make you think of mulga ridges and of open rolling
downs ?
Of the days of shears and oilstones, of the pack-
horses and swags,
With their coverings of calico and long-necked
tucker-bags,
Of the bridles and the breastplates made of good
old plaited hide,
And the rattle of the pennies in the two-up school
outside?”
In the tram a man looks up with face aglow,
Catching sight of laden waggons creaking slow.
“I was working on that run—
Work those days was only fun!”
In his heart he listens as the wheels sing- low:
“There are lorry-loads of wool ahead for ports beyond
the seas;
There are steamers lying waiting for their cargoes
at the quays.
Docs the sight of brands and numbers, A.A. fleece,
three forty-two,
Recall the Diamantina, Nebine, Thompson and Barcoo ?
The straight-necked, light-woolled wethers, with their
points so clean and bare—
Just a few above the average, you reckoned was
your share !
BETTER AND BETTER EVERY DAY.
NICE OLD GENTLEMAN: “I don’t know how you can drink so
much beer!”
TOMMY THE TANK: “Well — hie — you try Coo-eeishm. Y’ just
tell yerself yer can drink more an’ more — hie — an’ keep
on — an’ you can.”
The smell of smoky slush-lamps! When a voice
said, ‘Up a pound!’
How you watched the others’ faces till your turn to
‘speak’ came round ! ”
Horses swerve and slip, and pole- and trace-chains
ring,
Hoofs impatient from the road the hard stones fling
Right across the narrow street,
Underneath the passing feet.
Creaking brakes and wheels again commence to sing:
“There are lorry-loads of wool ahead for -ports beyond
the seas;
There are steamers lying waiting for their 1 cargoes
at the quays.
Does the creak of undercarriage or the jingle of the
chains
Take you back to deep-cut waggon tracks o’er ridges,
creeks.aiid plains,
To the chorus of the bullock-bells on dawn's first
breezes borne,
Drawing nearer, growing clearer, in the cool of
early morn?
Can you hear the long whips curling over shoulder,
ribs and flank,
As the waggon wheels sink deeper and the teamsters
double bank?”
Wool and horses fall behind, but still all day
Mom’ry takes me back to places far away,
Where the men with courage stout
Fight with flood and fire and drought-
In their unforgotten voices clear they say:
“There are lorry-loads of wool ahead for ports beyond
the. seas;
There are steamers lying waiting for their cargoes
at the quays;
There’s a job still open for you when you wander
back again
To the life you always long for, scorching sun and
blinding rain;
Windswept, bare and grassless paddocks; flooded
creeks and feed to spare;
Fragrant smell of rain-soaked hopbush on the damp
and heavy air;
Homestead paddock gates at sundown, pleasant
voices, cheerful lights;
And the eyes that you still fancy look in yours on
moonlit nights.”

“Orb”: That a vigorous forest could owe
its existence to the absence of Strawberry
may not be evident on the surface. It appa-
rently was not to “Pick” (B. 29/7/’26) when
he noticed a prolific growth of gums in an
orchard converted out of a stock paddock.
Darwin used just such an incident to illus-
trate the balance of nature. When open
portions of a barren heath in Surrey,
with only small isolated clumps of Scotch
fur on its rises, were fenced off, numerous
fir-trees grew and reached maturity within
the enclosures. He examined the surface of
the heath outside the fences, and found, in
one square yard, 32 seedling firs under the
stems of the heath. One of these seedlings
had 26 annual rings to its credit. Yet, until

“Are you sure he's a good watchdog?”
“Watchdog! W’y, lady, one of ’is ancestors was a gran’father

fenced off, not one of millions of these firs
ever raised its head above the grass. The
cattle grazed them down as fast as they grew.
“Pick,” therefore, is probably wrong in
assuming that his seeds were held in a state
of suspended animation. They were trying
to grow all the time.
“Gee Bee”: Losses of cattle from an un-
known cause (B. 29/7/’26) were fairly
common in the old droving days at different
parts on the Macquarie River. Certain camp-
ing-places were regarded with suspicion,

notoriously one at old Minors, n.-w. from
Dubbo. Even post-mortem exams, failed to
account satisfactorily for the cause of death.
Many experts held that a water-weed was
responsible. Although thistles grew in pro-
fusion at the places where the casualties
were most numerous, it was not generally
considered that they were solely to blame.
It is, however, a well-established fact that
in certain stages of growth they are fatal
to hungry sheep ; yet sheep may be pastured
on them all through the season without in-
jurious effects.
“Doodles”: There was a family of abos.
camped on the Murray near Euston whilst
I was on a station
there. One Jacky
was always at or
near the home-
stead. and became
a nuisance, so one
day I got him to
hold the grips of a
galvanic battery.
When I turned the
handle, Jacky col-
lapsed with fright,
and when released
made for the door.
The last I saw of
him he was doing
the hundred in less
than record time,
making for the salt-
bush. He did not
come near the place
for a long time,
but one day turned
up, all smiles, and
with him a cobber.
“Boss, him turnem

his request. I
tumbled to the joke,
and got Jacky to
hold on to his
cobber whilst the
cobber held the
grips. As I was
about to turn the
handle Jacky's face
was a study of sup-
pressed mirth. A
few turns and two howling blacks streaked
for the bush.

“Jim Carew”: “W.J.T.” is out when he
says(B. 19/8/’26) that “any horseman knows
that brumbies are not worth a tinker's curse
as horses.” When I was a toddler we lived
at Adaminaby, Mouaro district (N.S.W.),
and in those days brumby-running was a
fairly popular sport. My father had two
tamed brumbies on our place: one an iron-
grejf mare that he always boasted of as being
the safest stockhorsc in the district,, and the
other a bay mare he used as a special hack.
She stood about 15 hands, and the old man
rode her in several private matches against
other grass-fed horses, and she _ usually
romped home an easy winner. When we
left the Monaro we took both of these horses
with us.
“Tamornie”: Despite “W.J.T.’s" attempt
to put a smudge on “Gouger’s” picture ,of
brumbies descended from blood horses apd
racing mares, any overlander knowing the
Elsie (N.T.) brumbies will support
me in this. They were some of the bbst
horses in the North, sprung from Arab stock
introduced by Dr. Brown towards the end
of the last century. I used many of them
with satisfaction. A few certainly were
outlaws, in support of which I wear a scar
from the shoulder to the wrist on my right
arm where an Elsie Downs brumby mare
savaged me while I was trying to break her
in. But they were the exception.
“Two Seas": Although there were a lot
of useless “skins” among the brumbies we
yarded in the old days, the assertion that
“brumbies are not worth a tinker’s curse"
is too sweeping. One of the best mares for
rough country I ever rode was taken out
of a mob of brumbies. Surefooted as a
goat on the narrow mountain tracks, she
was as fresh and lively as any prad in the
mob after a day's hard mustering. I rode
her for five years and never regretted risking
my neck to get her behind the bars.
A lot of the five-furlong squibs racing around
Sydney are no better than the poorest of
the brumbies from a utility point of view.
“Tamornie” : I first came -across beri-beri
in the N.T. (B. 19/8/’26) during the
summer of 1915. Some tin-seratchers and
the natives employed by them became
affected. Sliced raw potatoes steeped in
vinegar and eaten three times a day worked
a cure in about 14 days. Years later, on
the Barkly'Tablelands in Centralia. an old
battler arrived at Lake Nash in a bad way
witli the same trouble. From the feet to the
knees his legs were swollen, and resembled
a mass of dough in which the indentations
made by finger pressure remained. Potatoes
and vinegar again effected a cure, this time
more quickly, as, in addition to giving him
the vinegar-soaked potatoes to eat, I rubbed
his legs with the acid.
“Nakhoda": Possibly “D. Wych” 18.
19/S/’2<>) might have found a remedy for
the beri-beri that killed off his pearling hands
closer to hand than at the chemist's shop in
Fremantle. A Dutch doctor 1 knew in Java
used to prescribe a daily feed of katjang
hijau, a very coarse, cheap and common
vegetable allied to the bean. Vitamines
were not heard of in those days, but pro-
bably it w r as their presence in the dose that
produced the remarkable cures he got. Inci-
dentally, he used to parade his patients every
morning to see how they were getting on.
When for the first time I saw the Charles-
ton danced, I knew whence the inventor's
inspiration came.
* * * *
“Smith” : “Congrevematches” (8.12/8/’2G)
were introduced to enable smokers to get a
light in windy weather. The head was about
three-eighths of an inch long and about the
thickness of a lead pencil. When struck
they fizzed and sparkled, and the head be-
came incandescent. The danger was that
the head usually dropped off while still red
hot, which doubtless accounts for their use
on board ship being presently prohibited.
Fusees and Vesuvians were later variants.
“Two Seas” : A bush storekeeper in Tas-
mania, when turning out some old stock
that had been in the place many years before
he took it over, gave me a box of “Con-
greves” as a curiosity, and it still stands
on my desk. The box is turned out of a solid
piece of softwood, and measures 3£in. in
length by IJin. in diameter, with some black
sand on the bottom for striking on. The
legend printed on a blue label beneath an
imposing coat of arms is rather quaint. It
runs thus :
Superior Congreve matches from one of the
greatest and most famous german manufactories.
I.N.E.
I think the initials stand for “I never ex-
plode,” as when I first tried them I never
got more than a smell. The matches are
slender, rounded wooden sticks, two inches
long, and are tipped with sulphur.
“Jimmy Possum”: As to the germination of
baked seed (B. 5/8/’26). Those of several of
the acacia family seem to spring only after
being subjected to severe heat, and probably
there are other seeds having the same pecu-
liarity. In many parts of Bananaland regu-
lar scrubs of wattle spring up where the top
of a tree or a log has been burnt, though
the species may not have appeared in the
immediate neighborhood for years. After ger-
minating, these iron-cased seeds send down a
thread-like taproot into the unbaked and
fertile soil beneath. Earth thoroughly
burnt, however, won’t support plant life for
some time afterwards.
“.T.H.8.”: I can support “Pick” (B.
29/7/’26) about the seeds of indigenous trees
preserving their germinating powers for long-
periods. A few miles north of Bundaberg
(Q.) there is an area of country that has
been ringbarked for at least 40 years, and
though repeatedly freed from undergrowth
young trees persist in poking up their heads
everywhere. The seeds of some trees appear
to acquire a long sleep before they are ready
for action.
“SITTING TIGHT.”
“Bouragi”: As one who has foregathered
with the Papuan, I cannot agree with
“Morob” (B. 22/7/’26) when he says it is
“safest to eat what the natives eat, and
leave alone what they won’t touch.” Putting
“long pig” on one side, I have in mind
wo paro, the smoked fish beloved of the
Binandele of n.-e. Papua. These are small
fish, thousands of which are caught in the
creeks and backwaters at spawning time.
They are spread out to “dry” without clean-
ing, in a blazing sun, and in an atmosphere
charged with anything over 50 p.c. of humid-
ity. They are then smoked on a platform,
pressed into baskets and hung up in the
larder. The Binandele think there is no-
thing quite like them on earth, and so would
“Morob,” though I wager he wouldn’t eat
them.
YACHTING IN TRINITY BAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
From Trinity Bay to the outer Cay
Yo ho! we luff to the shifting breeze,
And we trim our sails to the rising gales
As we steer for the roll of the Coral Seas.
Oh we jibe and tack through Ihe fairway track.
As we glide along- through the chartered leads,
And we lurch and reel on a canting keel.
While the coamings drip with a million beads.
Through the offing wide, in a flying stride,
Vo ho! We thrash to the outer deep.
And the -waters hiss as we skim and miss
The sunken reefs where the sea-slugs sleep.
How the waters swirl as they part and curl
From the coppered sides of the heeling hull,
And the halyards sing- iike a resined string,
As the yacht swings round like a reeling gull!
Though the old world frets o’er its post-war debts—
And their payment seems but a hopeless quest—
Though the seamen rage for a higher wage,
And the drought holds sway in the rainless West,
There’s a soothing balm out by reef and palm,
And a slothful life for the loafing hands
There’s a languid peace and a glad surcease,
On the Barrier Reef and its coral sands.
So what care we! For the seas are free
As the birds that skim o’er the hidden reefs,
For to-day is ours, and the passing hours
Are -warped by no worry of work-day griefs.
As the sun sinks low over Ravenshoe,
And the scrub-clothed hills loom up, opaque,
We make for the port with the runners taut,
And We leave Green Isle in our outer wake.
Oh, we skim along to a chorus strong,
And a wild nor’-easter blowing shrill,
With the spinnaker hard on a lateen yard.
While the running sheets through the reeve holes
trill.
There’s a lurid glare from the canefields where
The fiery tongues of the burning trash
Rick an open space on the sooty face
Of the northern night like a crimson gash.
We can hear the band on the spacious Strand
And the buoyant shouts of the romping bairns;
Then we furl our sails as the fair-wind fails,
And we heave to rest in the port of Cairns.
QUEENSLAND.

STOCKINGS
There are more unnamed heroes than those
who lie under the Are do Triomphe and in
the Abbey. There’s one in Sydney who has
“carried on” week in and week out since
the first home for limbless soldiers was
opened. She’s a tailoress by trade, and
every week-end at her workshop she puts
down her scissors and thread, to take them
up again at one of the homes for limbless
men. Here, while all around her a great
city pours its joyous soul into a thousand
bubbling streams of Sat-urday-to-Monday
enjoyment, she passes her time mending and
pressing and darning. But such a great
heart can turn the monotony of stitch, stitch,
stitch into a song of triumph !
Only orchids could be the fitting accom-
paniment to the pearls of great price worn
by Hugh Denison’s lady at the Victoria
League farewell to her the other day. The
Leaguers had risen to the occasion, and
against the sumptuous black of her ensemble
the tall and serene lady clasped an armful
of the _ most expensive of blooms. The
A\ omen’s Club, for the occasion, resembled
the Kingdom of Heaven, inasmuch as it was
inhabited by the righteous, appropriately
clad. Every woman had on the earthly
equivalent of the Biblical wedding garment
garnished to taste with furs and jewels. The
rooms themselves were decked with flower-
ing peach and bowls of white lilies that sur-
rounded the Cullen lady’s speech of farewell
llke some fragrant, illuminated border. Vera
Hadley sang like a bird surprised by spring,
and, in addition to the League’s impressive
president, Miss Macarthur Onslow, and the
local peeresses, came Mrs. Henry Dobson,
Tasmania, the save-your-pennies Miss
Mitchell, dear Dame Alice Chisholm, Miss
ooubeiran and George Fuller’s lady, very
arresting to the eye. Nor must be forgotten
the happy Mrs. Roystone Davey, crowned
with a large hat begirt by rich plumage.
• V a hopeful Power peeped
into the Wentworth on Monday night, his
letter home must have cause an uneasy feel-
ing. A country that could supply so many
generals, colonels, majors, captains and lieu-
tenants must be positively bristling with foot-
soldiers, air-soldiers and horse-soldiers. There
was a full-blown admiral at the gathering,
too. He was State Governor Dudley de
Chair, and as guest of honor at the Imperial
Service Club ball he appeared in full can-
onicals President of the club Brig.-General
Goddard, Lieut.-Colonel Murray and Lieut.-
Colonel Maughan were chief among the be-
dizened heroes who acted as hosts of the
evening.
“Lo, the poor Indian of untutored mind!”
sang a poet of long ago. But the purveyor
ol hexameters would have loed differently
had lie gazed on the Red Indian at the
.feminist Club party the other day. The
V finishing Race, having stoically endured
being the moral that adorned the tale of the
afternoon s lecturer on the Indian race, and
having done their warrior dance, suddenly
vanished from the Feminists’ ken. Follow-
nig the trail of the attractive V.A. from the
Soldiers Cafe below, the Red men, squaw
and papoose found themselves among the
gaily dressed tea tables that awaited the
onrush of the earnest ones above. The
papoose and the squaw solemnly walked from
boiu-d to board politely pointing out to the
, , ? cakes and decorated pieces that
took their fancy, and waiting firmly till they
got them. Then the baby Indian saw a
yellow-and-red balloon bobbing gaily aloft
He smiled widely and cooed just like any
other sophisticated infant, and demanded the
toy Furthermore, when his Indian papa
and mamma sat juggling teacups and cake-
rorks in the regulation afternoon-party
manner, the heir to fresh air and the waters
ot Minnetonka shrilly insisted on a cup of
tea to himself with lots of sugar in it.
In a week whose gaieties have been pallid
with that end-of-the-wmter feeling rather than
flushed with the gambollmgs of jocund spring
the Girls Realm tucked a happy memory.
The Guild dance at the Wentworth was a
friendly affair of pleasant dimensions, and
the idea of trading lavender, deep dyed or
faint of hue, from be-ribboned trays had
much to commend it. The Mosman centre
was reponsible for the gaiety, so Mrs. Alec
ihomson was queen of the revels. Among
her ladies-m-waiting were Grace Burrows
Orinsby 7 t,U! Guild > and Mrs. Lyster
Hunter s Hill, that social pinnacle of the
Pai ramatta River, hastened to a wedding
lasi, week of which its conservative soul
thoroughly approved. The bride in the case
was Larbara Ran ken, daughter of the R. L.
Kan kens, whose family roots were struck
lli<i river was sontinelled by red gums
instead of red roofs. William Alexander
was the young- man who undertook at All
Saints to endow her with his worldly goods
and see she had a credit account opened at
all the best shops. Ivory georgettes and
Limerick lace formed the bride's attire, while
sister Peggy ’maided in rose-patterned cliif-
lons with pink hyacinths as a forearm effect.
_ Hast week Lindley Evans, Sydney’s tallest
pianist, who did his growing in South
Africa, vowed himself to a life duet with
pretty Marie Stewart, of Strathfield. Marie,
who was squired by father, made an im-
pressive passage up the local Methodist
Church accompanied by a stirring outburst
by the Welsh male choir. White geor-
gette and cobwebby lace formed her delect-
able wedding garment, the same being misted
by a tulle veil that floated wide. Shell-pink
taffetas enfolded the three pictorial ’maids,
and his usual air of goodwill to men and
impeccable tailorings clothed Frank Hut-
chens, as in a kindly but firm manner he
banned over his chum to the cross-examina-
tion of Padre Grant, of Randwick. The
Strathfield Town Hall harbored the wedding
teast.
Killara Congregational Church housed flic
linking of Myra Davidson and Dr. J. O.
Walker, the one of Killara, the other of
Lindfield. The bride, a froth of silver lace
and ivory georgette served with a cluster
of waxen Dutch hyacinths, was followed by
two maids in daffodil georgettes girdled with
velvet. The Killara Golf Clubhouse served
numerous guests till a late hour, bride’s
mother doing the honors in black satin
shrouded in black lace.
Edith Lucas, of Mosman, wore a wedding-
frock that made even satiated St. Philip’s, of
Church Ilill, open an eye. It was of silver
tissue, made in the spreading style of the
’thirties. At each side rippled a cascade of
tiny frills tipped with silver and blushing
petal-pink from a chiffon lining. A long-
foam of tulle flecked with silver followed in
its wake, and Limerick lace and orange blos-
som gave the finishing touch. Other dramatis
person® were two bridesmaids, a train-
bearer in georgette of lilacy pink, and Dr.
C. Wiles, of Adelong. (P.S. —he was the
bridegroom.) Later, in a nest of white
hyacinths and pink sweet-pea, at the Ambas-
sadors. the bride’s mother reflected the spot-
light from her thickly-beaded and -sequined
black georgettes.
If Iris de Cairos Rego wore a eap it would
be as stuck about with feathers as an
Indian’s head-
dress. And one
of the most
ornate of the
plumes would
be her playing
of the piano
part in the
Emperor Con-
certo last week
at the Con.
This is a big
work, and the
clever Sydney
girl was always
sure, brilliant
and poetic.
The orchestra,
too, led by
director Orch-
ard, achieved
in this famous
work of
Beethoven one
of its greatest
successes. Iris is one of a family of notable
musicians, and is herself on the staff of
the Conservatorium.
Potter Merrick Boyd, turning his back
on the inclemencies of his native Melbourne,
lias been sampling a winter this side of the
border. Ilis has been the unique privilege of
being the only male instructor the New Eng-
land Girls’ College at Armidale has ever
hoarded in. Some months ago Merrick spent
a holiday putting in a potter’s kiln at the
Armidale school; but pottery was a small
part of his work among the New England
girls. This time he took the drawing
classes, and preached his favorite gospel of
Art observation to willing disciples. He
favors the Japanese plan of studying an
object for, say, three minutes, and then,
without glancing again at the model, drawing
for two or three minutes. This method is
said to be the secret of the sense of move-
ment that animates Japanese works. Merrick
has also held a show in Sydney and one
in Armidale—the latter a wedding of Art
and Mammon.
For three nights the Vagabonds, whose ends
are always charitable, filled St. James’s
with a commendable interpretation of Joan
Temple’s “Widow’s Cruise.” This comedy
follows the modern fashion of elimination of
characters, and introduces us intimately to
only four people. Of these, Ruby Coxhead
presented an unintentional bigamist in fine
clothes and a well-modulated voice. The two
husbands, one by bigamy and one by matri-
mony, were not unduly convincing, and
Zita Harris as Maddalena, an Italian maid,
with short skirts and long and lustrous plaits,
made an aesthetic sigh for life with domestic
accompaniments in the island of Capri.
The dance on the Marella in aid of Tres-
sillian promises to bring a smile to the face
of the Royal Welfare Society. The committee
is capable and of great dimensions. Mrs.
Lebby Hordern is paying for the band, and
the raffling of a monster box of chocolates
from Nestles will be an added sweetness.
£7Ol Bs. 9d. made a cheerful sound to the
Mother Provincial of Lewisham when the
cheque from the recent ball in the Palais was
dropped into the exchequer by Mrs. Harry
Daly. The pleasing ceremony took place last
Sunday, out at the hospital, preceded by
laudatory speeches and followed by tea.

was concern-
ing herself with weaving the household linen
with her own hands, instead of employing a
seamstress? The lady in the picture is the
bridge between the Penelopes of the past
and the female Rockefeller of the future. She
is Janet Mitchell, a daughter of Melbourne’s
well-known Iv.C., and her brand-new job is
to direct a Thrift department of the Govern-
ment Savings Bank of N. S. Wales. This
job will last at least three years, and the
first four or .five months of them Miss
Mitchell will spend in America, seeing what
the keepers of the world’s gold can teach
her. For over two years Miss Mitchell has
been education secretary of the Y.W.C.A.
She’s an L.R.A.M., as well as a B.A. Last
year she was a speaker at the Pan Pacific
Congress at Honolulu, and while in America
she will attend the annual conference of
bankers.
Zoologist Ernest Pollock, who lately led a
scientific expedition to Capricorn and other
tropic islands, gave the Lyceum Club a
vivid narrative on Friday night. Slides
were so life-like that a lady Ghost Bird
looked as though she would walk out into the
assembly-room if the lecturer touched her
feathers. Manipulated by Bobbie Williams,
without a single casualty—they improve by
not being put in upside down—they showed,
besides, members of the expedition valiantly
emulating De Rougement’s turtle ride. Mrs.
A. G. Thomas suggested a vote of thanks,
and it was seconded with enthusiasm by
botanist Sarah Hynes-—the lady who per-
suaded the Federal authorities to buy Mrs.
Ellis Rowan’s paintings.
The great flapper excitement of the
moment is the Gilbert and Sullivan Ball, the
date whereof is September 14 and the place
the Wentworth. The Viking’s daughter
Elaine is president of the ball, which is to
aid the Girl Guides, and she is heading the
Gondoliers’ set in a costume made by her-
self. The two pretty Higgins girls are on
the committee; so are Bethia Anderson and
Shirley Bavin. A quartette under Nathalie
Rosenwax will display some of the brightest
gems from the operas, while tableaux illus-
trate their warblings.
The pocket-handkerchief stage of the Play-
box looked like a corner of a fascinating
second-hand shop the other night, when the
curtains parted on Andreyev’s “He Who Gets
Slapped.” The moralisings of this circus
play—it really has no action—are surrounded
by screeching posters of many colors, gaudy
circus costumes around the walls, jostling
bizarre properties of the ring. Duncan Mac-
dougall was the “He” of the piece, and Isobel
Gawlor the beauteous but saccharine Con-
suelo. The play is billed for every Wed-
nesday till further notice.
Another enthusiasm that is helping the
mercury to run up is the Tennis Queen Com-
petition. Such well-known racket-swingers
as Daphne Akhurst, Marjorie Cox and Miss
Still are filling the city girls’ horizon ; but
Kathleen Vallins, Ada Cramp and Rene Eng-
lish have the attention of Hornsby, while
Granville has chosen Mrs. Norman Hem-
ming. If a V.A. at your favorite cafe bursts
up to you with an agonised stare and asks
you to take a Id. ticket for a chance in a
melodeon or a sea-lion, don't think she is
gibbering. She’s probably in some mysteri-
ous way giving her favorite tennis-player
a leg-up to Queendom. The crowning or
said royalty is to take place on September
28 at the Palais during the Lawn Tennis
Association’s dance.
Sydney’s pioneer exponents of two-piano
work, Frank Hutchens and Lindley Lvans,
drew a crowded Con. to their concert, "he
big work was the Bauer transcription of the
tremendous Bach Prelude and Fugue in C
Minor, and all the strength and grace that
the composer put into this work was drawn
out brilliantly. Saint-Saens’s variations on a
Minuet, by Beethoven, were a compelling
part of the programme; and Arensky and
Rachmaninoff were others drawn upon. The
Welsh Male Party, directed by Lindley
Evans and accompanied by Marie Stewart,
was billed to sing “All through the Night. ’
but considerately finished up in time to catch
the 10.45 home.
Miss Boswell will be in the crypt of St.
James to receive a shower of eggs for Sydney

Miss Brisbane's record of gay doings:—
Beryl Oarvosso had a blue and silver tea for
Leila Norton, who is soon to be married, and all
kinds of useful things for the new home arrived
for the guest of honor. Orchids and lupins decked
the tea-tables, and a shower of confetti fell from
a big •wedding-bell over the bride-elect's place.
Marie Burke is having a wonderful season in
“Katja.” On the opening night there wasn’t a
seat left in His Majesty’s, and the back of the
theatre was like the Brisbane trams at morn and
eve, so many were standing. “Wildflower” commences
to-day, but “Katja” could quite easily run longer.
Miss Rutherford had a party at the Women’s Olub-
rooms, backgrounded with marigolds and poppies,
and ephemeral mah jongg and eternal Shakspeare
took the floor. It was all for the benefit of the
Bush Book Club.
When Leila Manchester met John Laing Ewing at
St. John’s Cathedral to listen to “The Voice That
Breathed,” she wore brocaded cloth o’ silver, the
train mounted on white satin. Her veil was of
Brussels, her bouquet of white orchid and sweet-pea.
Melba Manchester and Alison Ewing ’maided in
blue mariette, with silver bandeaux broidered in
salmon and blue flowers, and they carried salmon-
hued gerberas. The National saw the feasting, in
a setting of pink and silver; Mrs. Manchester
hostessed in black pelisse with a bouquet of red
roses. Motoring, in the Northern Rivers region, is
the honeymoon plan.
Charles Chauvel is arranging a “Greenhide” night
at the Crystal Palace, to show the progress made with
the screening of his new film of that name. Elsie
Sylvaney plays leading lady and Bruce Gordon the
hero, and Jules Murray Prior and Irma Dearden
supply the comedy.
A farewell party was given to Mrs. A. V. Gulyer
amid gumtips and poppies in the Women’s Club.
Eunice Cochrane, Barbara Sisley and Mabel Zillman
attended to the musical programme. The guest of
honor leaves very .Boon for the Cold Country.
Mrs. John Reid, who died at Clayfield lately, was
the widow of Hutton’s chairman of directors. Only
recently her daughter Nell died suddenly while on
holiday in Batavia. The elder lady had been 40
years in Queensland, and during the war she raised
£2OOO by" a “Paddy’s Market” held in the grounds
of her home, Lyndhurst. She also interested her-
self in the Children’s. Hospital, and was renowned
for her exquisite needlework.
The Uni. Women’s Club had a party in the men’s
common-room, dressed up in pink azaleas and palms
for the occasion. Mrs. Walter Bryan, the president, re-
ceived, and tire Undergrad, girls were in cap
and gown. A play named “Snowed Up with the
Duchess” was read, and supper rounded off the
evening.
Gladys Frost’s student recital was held in the
Albert Hall before a very big audience. Peggy
Kean, Beryl Praiten, Gertie Wood and Rob Gow
played, and Nancy Muirhead’s charming voice was
uplifted in song, Nita Williams took Lena Ham-
mond’s place oni the programme, and was encored.
A dance decorated with wild-flowers was given in
All Saints’ Hall! to help the Seamen’s Institute to
buy a player-piano—and it won’t be happy till it
gets it. A roll-up from the mercantile boats in
port added to tine crowd.
Mrs. W. E. Robbins had a tea in the Eastern
Lounge at Lennoin’s for the wives of the visiting
and Brisbane bowlers. Carnations and vases of
gladioli and sweet-pea decked the lounge. Mrs.
Robbins was in white georgette with touches of
black.
Mrs. C. J. Elliot had a party at Ardencraig for
Everil Merson, who marries Frank Charlton very
soon. The hostess was in blue, the guest of honor
in navy and floral crepe de Chine. Mah jongg was
played amid spring flowers.
The end and the beginning of life touched strangely
when, on the day previous to her grandfather’s
death, the infant daughter of llvedale Parry-Okeden
was christened in the old man’s bedroom, at his
daughter’s home, Redlands, Corinda. It is only
a few days since Mrs. Harry Pockley was widowed,
and the passing of father and husband within so
short a time has been a heavy blow to her. Mr.
Parry-Okeden had spent the past six months mostly in
compiling and dictating a book of reminiscences,
which will soon be published.

At Caulfield on Saturday the world of
gaiety and fashion wasn’t as well represented
as usual, the members’ stand being palpably
well stocked with people who had a loan of
the tickets. The pews were deserted,
their Exes, being still on the sick-list, and
even in the committee’s ladies’ reserve there
was many a vacant chair. Some of the elect,
doubtless, were out of town owing to the
school vacation, which provides a convenient
time for family holidayiugs, and others had
taken their new spring finery to Sydney and
Randwiek. The weather was delightful, and
though tlie air was a trifle too fresh for one
to feel easy-minded without furs or a coat,
several well-cut suits were noted. Mrs. Ben
Ghaffey, undismayed at Manfred’s defeat,
wore tailored raiment in fancy plaid of gen-
darme blue, with a dash of fawn, topped by
a beige silk hat. Mrs. Richard Turnbull
was clad in grey tweed wi 1 h a velours hat of
burgundy shade. Thelma Halbert favored
a costume of a lovely shade of blue with a
waistcoat of white satin and hat of stone
color with uplift of blue. Yvonne Tolley
(Adelaide), who accompanied her, featured
a coat frock of mulberry hue, with many
buttons and wide pleats, and harmonising
millinery. Peggy Ewing, just back from a
four-months’ tour in the great Bootleg
Republic, sported a jumper suit of nattier
blue scattered with pearl buttons, and a felt
hat to correspond. Mrs. Ilarry Whiting,
wearing something extra-special in fur coats,
was saying “Pleased to he home again” after
a trip abroad. Leon Gordon again gave his
understudy a chance, and was rewarded by
seeing Tullius catch the judge’s eye.
According to Paris advices, spring is going
to bring with it the tall hat. The pioneer
of the swarm was on view at Caulfield—a
black felt which suggested cavaliers or
witches, according to disposition. The fair
wearer’s all-black turnout was very smart.
Australia’s sporting spirit was aroused at
the Yarra Glen and Lilydale Hunt Glub’s
meeting at Moonee YYillcy. The finish of
the Hunt Steeplechase was a ding-dong go,
and E. K. Field, who came in last, got as
good a reception as the winner. When
Scotch Thorn, Field’s mount, turned a somer-
sault over the brush fence iu front of the
stand, most people thought his rider was out
of the chase, but the Tasmanian mounted
again, went after tlie field, and saw the
race out, Even Scotch Thorn’s backers
joined in the applause which greeted the
plucky rider and his then very lame steed.
Though it was a beautiful sunny day the
dressing was of the best-to-bc-on-the-safe-
side sort —chiefly tailored suits, with some
smart coat frocks topped by ribbon and felt
hats. Bright colors were much worn, the
cheeriest apparel viewed being a crimson
coat with collar and cuffs of black fur, with
a tam-o’-shanter of red cloth. Shades of
petunia and blue predominated. Mrs. A. V.
Hiskens w T as trimly turned out. in grey
tweed with a nutmeg-brown silk hat. Mrs.
A. E. Dunne, of AVarrnambool, wore a bois-
de-rose felt hat with a coat and skirt of
cocoa hue. Mr. and Mrs. Harold Newbigin
and daughter Joan, Mrs. Ross Fenner, Gwen
Johnston, Fairlie Lyon, Helen Taylor and
some of the Madden girls were among the
followers of the hounds who watched the
racing.
Scarlet, gold and black dressed the walls
of St. Ivilda Town Hall when Ormond Col-
lege gave its at-home one night last week.
The master of the college, D. R. Picken,
with his wife, who wore a black gown,
grasped hands in greeting. Trinity’s Warden,
Dr. Behan, was there too. Many of the
younger set seem to have reserved their
very prettiest frocks for this dance, and
once again taffetas had the best of it. Nancy
Irvine was in cosmos pink, with flutings of
ribbon; Miss S. Vincent, of Geelong, wore
shot-green and silver taffetas with beaded
adornment ; Cynthia Duigan was a vision
in blue and silver. Professor and Mrs. Agar
brought their just-arrived-from-England
nieces—Betty Rose, gleaming in raiment of
oxidised silver, and Mollie in filmy drapery
of lace of cornfield yellow. Mrs. J. C.
Behan had a blue gown with sparking of
silver lace.
The “Australian Composers’ Night” at the
Australian Church on Saturday evening-
one of the Musical Society’s bright ideas—
produced a varied and interesting pro-
gramme. Frank Hutchens, of Sydney, was
represented by a violin solo and a neatly-
made trio for violin, ’cello and piano, the
latter well played by Rita Hope, Coral Tren-
erry and Helga Brennecke. Violinist Stan-
ley Adams and Hilda Roberts introduced a
sonatina, very modern in its harmonies and
progressions, by Arthur Benjamin, who is
making headway as a composer in the Big
Smoke. Two short pieces of his own were
played by the blind pianist George W. Finlay.
Prof. Heinze supported Margaret Sutherland
in a sparkling performance of her sonata
for violin and piano. Songs by Ernest Sage
and some pianoforte preludes played by
Hilda Roberts gave Louis Lavater a place
in the symposium. Other Australian com-
posers represented were Stewart Burton,
Amy Dickinson, James Brash and Cecilia
Mac Mullen.
The Repertory Society’s at-home in its
new rehearsal rooms on Saturday night
attracted about 70 members, all glad they
came. E. G. Coppel chatted about “The
Drama” as curtain-raiser to the double bill,
which comprised Laurence Housman’s “Pos-
session,” staged by Betty Rae; and “The
Interlude of Youth,” a sixteenth-century
morality play, directed by Irene AY ebb.
Period costumes, effectively contrived by the
performers, were a feature of this presenta-
tion. Robert Garran and his lady, the
handled George Symes, the Arnold Seitz
couple, artist George Bell and Enid Dcrham
figured in the audience.
Fritz Hart's new opera, “Deirdre in Exile,”
which is coupled with Gluck’s “Orpheus” on
the programme of the Operatic Society’s show
at the Playhouse from the 22nd to 25th of this
month, was explained by its composer to
members of the Music Club tin’ other night.
Lilian Crisp, Lilian Stott and Howard
Andrews, who sang excerpts from the parts
they are to take in the coming production,
gave a good account of themselves, and
created a lot of interest in the work they
are to perform. The director of the Albert-
street Con., who was a fellow-student iu
London with Gustav Holst, also explained
Holst’s one-act opera, “Savitri,” which Mel-
bourne will hear on the 30th, under the wing
of the British Music Society.
Some of the students of the Melba
Con. swarmed out of Albert-street on
a recent evening to give a subscrip-
tion concert in the cosy reception-room
of the Lyceum Club. The maidens, in white
arrayed, with here and there a roulade of
silver or gold, raised sweet voices in early
English, French, German and Italian music,
and the instrumentalists’ pieces likewise
dated back to tlie spinet and the harpsichord.
Iris Brown, a scholarship student from the
Apple Isle, and Greta Callow, holder of a
J.C.W. scholarship, were about the best of
the singers. Kathleen McManamny and
Myrtle Frazier most successfully caressed the
keyboard, and Margot Macgibbon and her
fiddle proved to be on quite good terms.
Gmntips, pussy-willow and daffodils helped
to make an attractive setting. Congratula-
tions and criticism were parcelled out by
Director Fritz Hart and others, with the
coffee and the cake, at the end of the evening.
The maiden of undocked wavy locks is
Cora O'Farrell. The last of the name to
achieve fame
on the concert
platform was
Du Manner’s
heroine with
the fascinat-
ing toes, but
she didn’t
know how to
sing. Cora
O’Farrell does,
and she lias a
Melba Co n.
scholarship to
her credit to
prove it. She
is a contralto.
Her voice will
be heard in a
production of
Gluck's “Or-
pheus” at the
Playhouse on
Saturday
night, Septem-
ber 25 ; she will have the leading role. Fritz
Hart’s one-act opera “Deirdre in Exile” will
get a spin at the same time. Miss O’Farrell
knows what the footlights look like. She
took part in the recent Gilbert and Sullivan
revival at His Majesty’s, appearing iu small
parts and in the chorus. Broothorn did the
picture.
The Alfred Hospital Auxiliary, with 43
senior and seven junior branches, had a
happy annual reunion at tlie hospital the
other afternoon, and after the tale of good
deeds had been told there was music. Violet
MacGregor came with her fiddle, helpful Wal-
ter Kirby, who arranged the entertainment,
sang a stave or two himself, and Kathleen
Rochfort, Madame Kroef, Mrs. Fleming
Dunstan, George Chant and others gave
Daisy Willoughby, at the piano, something
to accompany. Later there was tea. The
auxiliary’s good service—in the last 10
months it has contributed cash and goods
to the value of £4500 —has inspired a lot
of respect for the forethought of Its origi-
nator, the hospital’s secretary, D. G. Mac-
dougall, and he was given a gold watch and
chain.
The Liedertafel bestowed its gold badge upon
its president, Jimmy Dyer, tlie other night.
He lately slipped £5OO into the Liedertafel’s
bank account, on fixed deposit. When it has
doubled itself by compounding the interest
it is to serve as a permanent endowment.
Only a Scot could have been at the same
time so generous and so canny. Mayor Brun-
ton, who in his salad days sang blithely
under the Dyer baton, with other members
of a choral society, handed over the bauble,
and said kind things about the recipient
and his spouse—both hard workers in tlie
cause of music. The Athenaeum gallery
echoed the applause and reverberated to the
tuneful voices of Viola Morris, Norman Ben-
nett and tlie Lyric quartette. The Brunton
lady, the Liedertafel’s conductor, Mansley
Greer, and his wife, and the ,J. F. White-
heads were in evidence.
The recent series of entertainments in aid
of the Civil Ambulance Service, proceeds
fr o m which
a rc expected
to total about
£l4OO, owed a
whole lot of
their success
to Rose Pater-
son (photo-
graphed here
by Lafayette),
wli o headed
the hand of
workers. For
some years
Gcrt r u d e
Rennie ran
t: li i s annual
hop for the
V.C.A.S., hut
he r services
were not avail-
able this year,
and Miss Pat-
erson. who, by
the way, has
earned some distinction as a cluua-yaiiiter,
stepped into the breach and proved herself
a resourceful and capable engineer. The
usual dance had as additional money-raisers
a bridge party that brought in about £l6O
and a gymkhana at Moonee Valley which
produced over £750.
When the travelling representative of the
National Gallery recommends the splashing
of large sums on ancient European works, it
usually endorses Lis recommendation; but
when an Australian artist is under considera-
tion it hesitates. At a recent show of John
Rowell’s pictures it set aside two for further
consideration, and it continued to deliberate
till the last day of the exhibition, and then
turned the pictures down. While the rest of
his works were sold, the artist was thus
left with the two best on his hands, though
one went later.
The Hon. Nesta Sidonia Fitzgerald, who'
once astonished suburban Melbourne by sur-
veying it through a monocle, lias announced
her engagement, and the wedding-bells will
have stopped vibrating before this page puts
on its pink frock. The bride is the elder
daughter of Lord Charles Fitzgerald of East
Melbourne, and he is a son of the late Duke
of Leinster. Her aunt, Atlienia Claudius,
was a well-known actress. The bridegroom
is Frank E. Maloney, B.E. and B.Sc., who
hails from the Apple Isle.
Lines of waiting limousines fringed
Domain-road when Maud Robertson, daugh-
ter of Dr. and Mrs. W. A. N. Robertson, of
Malvern, kept a date with (i. R. B. Batter-
son at tlie Grammar School Chapel. Tlie
bride, who was attended by four maids in
pink, one being her twin sister Nina, wore
gloss of ivory satin and shimmer of pearl,
with froth of tulle and lovely old lace as
veil. Cliastleton was later invaded by the
wedding guests.
Blue and silver was the color scheme when
Phyllis Dawson, elder daughter of Mrs.
Dawson, of South Yarra, became Mrs.
Charles V. Jackson the other day. The
bride’s array was of lame and lace all silver,
which shone through her grandmother’s wed-
ding veil ; tlie old lady was there to see its
resurrection. The bridal train was the one
that had been trailed by pretty Aileen
Mclnerney when she curtsied at Buckingham
Palace. A little train-bearer, Joan Sheldon,
was in blue and silver, and the only ’maid,
Dolores Dawson, chose georgette shaded in
all the tones of a bed of delphiniums. The
bride’s mother, who used to be known to
concert-goers as Louie Morcll, bade the
guests make merry at Wickliffe House.
The first September bride of 1926 changed
her name at St. Mary’s, Caulfield. She was
Kathleen Joyce, daughter of that Alex. K.
Finlay who lost his life in the Gippsland
Lakes disaster, and of Mrs. E. F'ortescuc.
The bridegroom, Leslie John Cackburm
comes from Leeds, in the north of Fogland.
The bridal gown, of petal-pink georgette and
lace, resembled a floating summer cloud em-
bellished with silver. A lace veil that had
figured before iu family history, and which
bore sprays of orange blossoms, drifted down
the length of train, and a shower of pink
blossoms was carried. The one ’maid, Myra
Stuart, wore a billowy frock of mauve geor-
gette and a bandeau with floral ornamenta-
tions.
The late Rear-Admiral Tickell's youngest
girl, Katherine, who lives with her mother
at Kew, has entered the engaged section.
The young man is Frank Mackenzie, eldest
son of the A. E. Georges of Cobden.
Mrs. W. Leonard, senior, is now on her
homeward journey after a holiday in London.
Her son Clive is accompanying her, but
bis wife is to remain for some months longer.
Mrs. Dick Beatty is hurriedly packing up
to join her Commander at Bombay. A daugh-
ter of the Ritchies of Bass Lodge, one of Vic-
toria’s oldest families, and very popular, she
will be really missed. With her go two
small sous. The younger, a godson of the
famous Admiral of the Fleet, was born on
Trafalgar Day, and is already showing signs
of a taste for sea salt.
When 1 >r. Bryce resigned the Directorship
of Agriculture in New Guinea because the
extravagant expenditure pained him, the
Malay States snapped him up at a tempting
salary to keep an .eye on their rubber re-
search bureau, and now, comfortably in-
stalled at Kuala Lumpur, he has requested
the presence of his family. Mrs. Bryce
hurried over to Adelaide to say good-bye to
mother before collecting her two children
and a suitcase.
The Association of Creches got up at its
last annual meeting and said it really ought
to be subsidised by factories and municipali-
ties. In the past 1- months, at the nine
creches which have sprung up in the 17
years of the association’s being, the attend-
ances have numbered 78,216; arid the “day-
homes” have enabled and do still enable
wives and widows to earn a crust while their
offspring are minded. After the meeting
there was an hour of relaxation in the Dutch
kitchen of the Mia Mia tearooms. Mrs. James
Alston, tin' president, was hostess.
Agnes Murphy’s note from London: —
Pauline Bindley, who has been studying with
Spencer Clay for a year, has been engaged to sing
coloratura roles with the Royal Carl Rosa Opera.
Henry B. Phillips, managing director of the co.,
•who at one time was in partnership with Tom
Quinlan as a concert agent, is very enthusiastic over
the power and flexibility of her voice, and assures
her of success. Kingsley Lark, another Australian-
born singer, is also among the new engagements for
the forthcoming season. Miss Bindley will sing Gilda
to the Duke of Ben Williams, who is one of the
most attractive tenors to be heard in England. It
was to his Duke in “Rigoletto” that Evelyn Seotnev
made her London debut with the (Jail Rosa co.
Sister Adelaide’s tale of a serried week: —
Torrents of rain and a submerged course caused
the postponement of the A.R.C. meeting from Satur-
day to Thursday, which reduced the attendance con-
siderably.
On Saturday night St. Peter’s gave a dance to
entertain Melbourne Grammar’s footballers, and there
was a great time at the college, all the prettiest
maidens being- invited.
Members of the Melbourne Methodist College sports
team, who have been playing basket ball and
tennis, were entertained at the kiosk in the Botanic
Gardens, by the Adelaide College sports team, and
the inter-State golfers of both sexes are coming in
for some frivols now the tournaments are over. Dan
Cudmore and his pretty wife gave a large ball at
the Maison de Danse (Glenelg) in their honor. It
was a gay gathering and the Maison was a bower of
gorgeous sweet-peas. Mrs. Dan looked chic in pale
pink satin beaute, beaded in a deeper shade; and
the Juno-like Mrs. Alex. Russell, of Victoria, gowned
in black, was a most striking figure.
The Masonic Order decided to shake a leg last
week, four Lodges at Glenelg giving a ball at the
Maison de Danse. The lancers were featured most
successfully, and the Charleston was absolutely
haired.
A second meeting inis been held to discuss Mayoress
Bruce’s ball in aid of the S.P.O.A. in October. As
a compromise between fancy dress and ordinary, it
is suggested that wigs to match frocks should be worn.
Donations and promises are coming in well. Mrs.
K. Duffleld and Bill Gunson are the joint secretaries
and Dora Muecke says she will provide false noses
for all.
W. G. T. Goodman’s pretty daughter Joan is
recovering in Melbourne from the effects of a motor
smash in which she was badly injured. A ear col-
lided with a taxi-cab in which she was returning
from a dance.
Dr. R. .John Hardstaff, an eminent Detroit surgeon
specialist, is visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs. John
I-lardstaff of this city.
The arrival of Cobham had its humor —he missed
the ’planes that went to meet him and the crowd
thought he was just the aerial mail. Priminister
Bruce and his wife had a. somewhat similar experi-
ence because they got in half an hour before they
were expected.
Last week the Dominican community at North
Adelaide, which Mother Mary Ravmund has directed
as prioress or sub-prioress for 35 years, celebrated
the 70th anniversary of her entry into the religious
life. Mother Raymund, who had been one of the
community at Stone, the famous Dominican Con-
vent in England, was one of the pioneer band who
founded the order in Australia in 1883.

NOTIONS
Tho flying Valicare, previously unbeaten,
found her master at Warwick Farm (N.S.W.) on
Saturday in Windbag, hero now of 17 races, including
the Melbourne Cup. They met at w.f.a. in the
Warwick Stakes over the mare’s favorite distance, a
mile, and the pencillers w-ere so positive that young
B. R. Payten -would lead in his third winner—
Grosvenor, 5 to 1, had landed the Hurdle Race and
Quixotic, 8 to 1, the Campbelltown Handicap for
the P. H. Osbornes, who own Valicare —-that they
demanded odds of 3 to 1, Windbag being at 7 to 2
against and the others (Royal Tea, Rapine and
Arendal) from 14 to 50 to 1. Valicare, who was
ridden by Jones, Toohey being under the ban, looked
to have done more work than Windbag, who was
a bit on the burly side, and did her best to break
him up by darting to the front when the barrier
went up and cutting out the first furlong in 12sec.,
the second in 11-jsec. and six in lmin. 124 sec.
Windbag nevertheless contrived to keep within strik-
ing distance, accompanied by his stable-companion
Royal Tea. There didn’t seem much hope for him
as the Valais mare entered the short straight, but
when Munro called on him he responded splendidly,
reduced a bit of the gap with every stride, drew
level with the leader, and passed her, to win by
half a neck in lmin. 38scc. —-a record for the course.
Rapine, who is by no means a back number, was
four lengths away, having settled the tiring Royal
Tea when everyone -was watching the two champions.
Jones was blamed for the bonny bay mare’s defeat,
but as a matter of fact he rode to orders and got
every ounce out of her. She was beaten by a horse
who will beat her at any distance, from one mile
to three.
The meeting of Rampion (6 to 4) and Limerick
(2 to 1) in the Hobartville Stakes showed that the
Rossendale —Royal Pet colt is the superior animal
at seven furlongs. Though not quite so forward as
the Maoriland gelding-, the stylish fellow was always
doing a bit better. He turned into the straight
with a clear lead and, Ci-acknell keeping him at
top speed, won by two or three lengths from
Limerick, who was three lengths or so ahead of
Amusement (14 to 1), none of the others (there were
13 starters) being in the picture. Limerick ran
out wide in the straight, but the result would have
been the same if McCarten had steered him straight.
However, he shapes more like a stayer than (lampion,
and this page will have him on its side in the
A.J.C. Derby. There may be a hope in that race
for Amusement, who is bred on staying lines (he is
by Comedy King—Sumurun) and is still carrying
superfluous flesh.
A stable move in favor of Pantheon, who, like
Rampion, is trained at Randwiek by F. Williams and
owned by J. E. and C. 11. Brien, would have been
followed by hundreds during the betting on the
Spring Handicap, 11 furlongs. However, there Was
so little money for the handsome English horse
(he is by Tracery—Scotch Rose) that he drifted to
12 to 1, Mountain Prince and Star Stranger dividing
favoritism at 9 to 2, Valamita (who was fated to lose
his rider) being at 7 to 1, Boonala at a point
longer, Count Cavour at 10 to 1 and Lucy Thrice
at 12 to 1. Boonala looked a likely winner as he
shot into the straight ahead of Lucy Thrice, Mountain
Prince and the rest, but Star Stranger and Pantheon
joined in the argument, and the latter romped home
from the Maoriland horse, Boonala and Lucy Thrice
dead-heating for third. Lucy was rushed from nearly
last to second in a few furlongs, and, more judiciously
ridden, she may have a rough chance in the Metro-
politan with 6st. 71b. But it is hard to see how
she is to defeat Pantheon, who carried 21b. more
than his Metropolitan weight (9st. 61b.) and made
hacks of his field in exceptionally good time (2rnin.
184 sec.), though not considered forward enough to
win. Star Stranger, who also had 21b. more than
his Metropolitan burden (Bst. 91b.), ran decently
considering that he met with a lot of trouble, and
will earn his oats on this side of the Tasman.
* * * *
The Heroic-Manfred match in the
V.A.T.C. Memsie Stakes, nine furlongs, at Caulfield
was even more thrilling than the Windbag-Valicare
affair, for the excitement was on from the start, in-
stead of being confined to the struggle in the
straight. The Valais chestnut, who conceded the
bay 41b., but was in better shape, was always at, odds
on, McShortodds demanding 6 to 4 at the finish of
operations, while Manfred, who has grown into a
magnificent horse, was at 4 to 1, The Banker at
two points longer (there was some big money for
the N.Z. Cup winner), Royal Charter at 15 to 1, and
Spearfelt at 20’s. Although Manfred’s manners have
apparently improved, Lewis had a little trouble with
him at the post, and -with Heroic also a bit fractious,
a circus display seemed momentarily probable. How-
ever, both jumped away well, and the spectators
settled dow-n to watch a great race. The chestnut
was soon out in front, but Ben Chaffey’s champion
ran up to him at the half mile and, with three
furlongs to go, was three parts of a length in
front of him. They turned for home on even terms,
Heroic being on the rails. It w T as a grand tussle
all the -way down the straight, but condition told,
and Heroic won by a neck from Manfred, with The
Banker, who finished in great style, 24 lengths away,
the time being lmin. 53sec. There is no arguing
against the fine performance of Heroic, on whom
Cairns was at his best, but lots of people will back
Manfred when they met again.
Nearly all the 18 starters in the Heatherlie Handi-
cap, nine furlongs, w r ere supported in the ring,
Robespierre finishing up favorite at 4 to 1, with
Chickling and Eridanus next in demand at 6’s.
David Garrick (20 to 1) led at the hpme turn, and
there looked like taking it out, but Textile (10 to 1)
came fast on the rails and beat the Comedy King
gelding home by a length, with Homerus (12 to 1),
THE GREATER GAME.
who got into some trouble after being prominent for
a time, a good third; time, Imin. 53 3-ssee. Textile,
who was second last half a mile from home, is in
the Caulfield Cup, for which he was fancied last
year, with 7st. 121 b., 51b. less than he won with.
He is trained by E. J. O’Dwyer for C. G. Bro .vn.
Lou Robertson had something for his followers to
bet on in the first division of the Doona Trial,
seven furlongs, in Sol Green’s imported horse Gothic
(Tracery—Sundrilla). Backed from 10 to 1 to 3 to
1, Gothic won in hollow fashion from Rainproof
(7 to 1) and Epilogue (15 to 1), which animal has
been backed for the Caulfield Cup. The second
division was taken by Leon Gordon’s Tullius (5 to 2),
whom Duncan landed an easy winner, and that nice
horse Ambassador (8 to 1), despite his lOst. 81b.,
proved much the best of a big field in the Warriston
Welter. Punters had the novel experience of seeing
four favorites successful, and the change was
appreciated.
* * » *
There was great, cheering at Victoria Park,
Adelaide, when old Haorna ran away with the
S.A. Grand National Steeple (his second), carrying
12st. over the three miles, in 6min. 4jfsee. Con-
ceding lumps of weight to 16 opponents, the wonder-
ful little fencer led from the second jump, and in
his progress from the last fence to the finishing-
post there was one continuous roar. The div.
was £5 10s. for £l, Missing Link (nowhere) and
Huja (a bad second) having been slightly better
favored in the machine. Thousands of those who
cheered the game old fellow, must have wished that
he would straightway enter upon the retirement
he had so splendidly earned. But there is no
sentiment among big betting owners, to which class
the man for whom he won 14 races belongs. The
poor little beggar u:as started again two days later
with 12st. 121 b on his back. He fell at the first
fence, and suffered such dreadful injuries that,
after lingering until the next morning, he was shot.
* -X- * *
“Ascot”: Once more I rise to state that
Brisbane racing form is best followed the wrong way
about. A punter friend carefully records the last
three horses to pass the post, and backs up on them
at their next start. After King Seremond and
Strongbow had run last and second last in the
Metropolitan, he proclaimed them unbeatable in
Tattersall’s Cup. They ran first and second (in
reverse order), and nothing else ever looked to have
a chance. Fine Stitch showed that he was coming-
back to form by running last in the Ascot Handicap
before -winning at Tatt.’s meeting. At Albion Park
the reverse-action tipster gave Gay Galah as a dead
bird for the second division; “Can’t be beat,” he
declared. “What makes you so certain?” he u r as
asked. He produced his form book, showing that Gay
Galah had twice run last during the month. This
time it flew home first. The tipster is now patiently
following two horses which have not only run last
repeatedly, but have emphasised the tip by tailing
their fields twice in one day.

If a little bill which Vic. Ministry, per
Hon. Minister Harris, has launched in the Legislative
Council is pushed through, doping of racehorses
will be made a specific offence. The main clause
interdicts the employment of drugs when used “with
intent to impede or affect the safety, endurance,
speed, sense, health or physical condition” of the
victim. That seems comprehensive enough.
. * * * *
The 10-miles N.S.W. championship at
Kensington (Sydney) racecourse proved more to the
taste of St. Stephen’s (Vic.) Harriers than the affair
over the jumps a week before. Thanks to excellent
teaming, they gathered dub honors with 47 points,
St George coming next with 75 points and Botany
(78) third. For the third successive year Alleyn
Gainsford (St. George) was first through the worsted,
a fine sprint landing him 30 yards ahead of the pace-
making Mackenzie (Cumberland), with Bell (St.
Stephen’s) third; the time was 56min. 4see.
The car generally has to play second
fiddle to the motor-cycle when pure speed is being
produced on the concrete saucer. At Maroubra
(N.S.W.) on Saturday the fastest car lap (95 m.p.h.)
was done by Don Harkness’s Grand Prix Ballot, with
an engine measuring up to 4817 c.c. But H. Wood,
on a 495c.c. Douglas motor-cycle, scooted round the
circuit at the rate of 99 m.p.h., equalling the track
record made three weeks before by Peel on a Harley-
Davidson of twice the power, and setting up a world’s
record for the larger-sized Douglas. The Maroubra
Gold Helmet changed hands, but not heads again,
H. T. Byron, on a 499e.e. Sunbeam, being the latest
holder. Holder is right, because the metal hat
doesn’t fit him. Sidebottom, the defeated wearer of
the trophy, consoled himself by winning the Speed-
way Handicap. The most noticeable feature of the
racing, taken all round, was the high standard of
driving. The peculiarities of the track seem now to
have been mastered by most of the competitors.
* * * *
Those who absented themselves from the
Sydney Stadium on Saturday because an advertised
match—“Norkey” Fowler v. a French lightweight—
had fallen through missed a really capital scrap.
Gordon Iviely, a Vic. welterweight, and sturdy Bill
Richards put up an exciting 15 rounds in which the
value of a bit of science was amply demonstrated.
Richards hit hard, but Kiely took it smiling, and,
using a clever left, held the advantage throughout,
winning on points. Kiely is a protege of Grime’s,
and is a credit to him.
* * * *
Harry Pearce (9st. 71b.), having disposed
of most of the second-raters, has been clamoring for
a match with Bert McCarthy (9st. 941 b.). He
got his chance at Melbourne Stadium on Saturday
night, and with it such a hiding that when, bruised
and bleeding, he turned his back on the enemy in
the thirteenth session, Quick mercifully intervened.
In a second bout Jack Cameron (lOst. 811 b.) was
giving a good account of himself against Laffineur
(lOst. 9:11b.) when he slipped and wrenched an
ankle. The French lad chivalrously stood off until
the gong. Coming up for the next round, Jack
was so obviously in pain that the argument was
stopped.
* * * *
That there is luck in golf was shown at
Seaton (S.A.) by the amateur championship of
Australia going to Len Nettlefold, by two up
in the final from Ivo Whitton; although Whitton,
as already recorded, had been able to win the
open championship from a much better field, since
it included professionals. Golf is a game in which
the amateur is not considered blasphemous if occa-
sionally he tries his strength against a pro. Nettle-
fold had been only 10th in the open, 12 strokes
behind Whitton. However, the Hobart youth has
the match-plaving temperament, and, not yet 21,
should have a big future in the game. Stewart
(S.A.) and E. Smith (Vic.), who were second
and third in the open, were beaten in a professional
competition by Campbell, of Leura (N.S.W.) ; and,
in a further one, Le Fevre (Vic.) beat the lot.
The country championship of S.A. went to tlie
reliable Toogood for the third time; the runner-up
was Barrett, who held the title as far back as 1909.
“Amateur Pro.”: There is little to sur-
prise in American promoter Pyle’s announcement that,
besides Suzanne Lenglen, he has a dozen or so assorted
amateurs of light and leading in his bag. Suzanne,
walloping duds in exhibition tournaments, would have
been a poor draw, and the building up of a
reliable “stable” was imperative. A visit to Aus-
tralia is talked of, so there is at least the possibility
of defections in this country. More than one of our
planets has complained in the past of inadequate
“expenses” and demanded special financial considera-
tion as a right; and others have been accused of
being amenable to “trade influences.”
The Australians’ match against Sussex
added yet another to the drearily long list of draws.
With a lead of 77 on the first innings, Bardsley closed
the second when 4 wickets were down for 153
(Macartney 65). The county was left with 231 to
win, a feat that was within the bounds of possibility
if batsmen had opened their shoulders to the googlie
bowlers, although it would more likely have ended
in disaster. Sussex, however, neither risked every-
thing for a win nor fell back on “safety first”
tactics; it was a betwixt-and-between display,
half the side being outed for 157. Tate (55) and
Bowley (30) put on 83 before they were separator;;
after that wickets fell too regularly for Sussex to
have a chance but not rapidly enough to give Aus-
-tralia one. Tate supplied the hitting; he has some-
what atoned for the lack of sting with the ball
against the tourists by showing that he can get runs
in a style which his batting in Australia hardly sug-
gested. Per contra, Mailey, who put up some un-
commonly fine performances with the bat against
Gilligan and co., has got down among the “rabbits”
this trip as a scorer. Grimmett took four Sussex
wickets in the second innings.
It w T as a distinctly powerful “English XI” that took
the field at Folkestone, with four internationals, in
Chapman, Woolley, Hendren and Larwood, and some
notable county players, including Tennyson, who cap-
tained England in ’2l, Jardine, of Surrey, and
“Tiger” Smith, the Warwickshire ’keeper. Rain, how-
ever, ruined the game, barely permitting of an
innings apiece, at which stage the Australians were left
with about the same advantage as in the preceding
match. The visitors batted first and the most notable
features of the innings were Hendry’s batting and
Larwood’s bowling. The former gave evidence of a
return to form, as well as health by scoring 81; the
Notts express captured 7 wickets for 95. Other scorers
who helped were Bardsley (55), Ponsford (47),
Gregory (33) and Collins (29), the total reaching
274. The English XI replied with 199 for 9 wickets
(Jardine 38, Astill 35, Hendren 30, Woolley 29).
Gregory flickered up by taking the first three wickets;
Mailey and Ryder claimed two apiece.
The two-days match against the Civil Service, which
started on Saturday at Chiswick, is a new fixture.
It’s a long lane that has no turning, and this game
against not very formidable but far from diffident
opponents—Collins, who won the toss for the C.S. and
sent Australia to the wickets, is said to be a
brother of the wary Herbert —gave Taylor a chance
to break his long spell of heavy weather and improve
his average—that is, if the match is to rank as a
first-class one, and the statistics-weavers of the Aus-
tralian dailies are more liberal in this regard than
the English ones. Anyway Taylor had his day; he
made 201, and with Everett added 155 for the seventh
wicket. Everett’s contribution was 100 n.o. Those
who merely reached double figures were Woodfull (43),
Collins (27) and Ryder (26). The innings was closed
with 454 on the board for 7 wickets. The 10-to-4
brigade could only manage 59 in reply. Collins
took 6 wickets for 17.
Lancashire has won the county championship for
the first time since -1904. For this it can mostly
thank E. Tyldesley, who made 2770 runs, ..averaging
67.56, and our own E. A. McDonald, who took 163
wickets, averaging 19.04. McDonald might have
made all the difference to Australia in the Test
matches. English critics agree that on his day he
is the finest bowler in the world.
lii the first of the Sydney League semi-
finals University overwhelmed Glebe by 29 points
(7 tries and 4 goals) to a solitary try. The
students were helped to their win by Glebe’s con-
tinual failure to complete scoring movements ; still,
they were the better team, back and forward. Finn,
at lull back, and the untiring Ryan, in the forwards,
were a great Uni. pair. Holder, at centre for Glebe,
deserved better support from his mates, but the
Red pack was outpaced and out-conditioned by
’Varsity’s vanguard. South Sydney was beaten, 17—
13, by Newcastle in a challenge game in Coalopolis ;
next Saturday it is to play Eastern Suburbs, and the
winner will face University in the final. Granville,
by conquering Gladesville-Ryde, 2 goals to 1, became
entitled to meet Balgownie for the Metropolitan
Soccer premiership next Saturday. Under Australian
Rules, IV. Suburbs (8 —9) beat Newtown (6 —15),
and will now meet Eastern Suburbs in the “grand”
final.
* * * * .<
At 3 p.m. last Saturday the Vic. League
football position was most intriguing. close
were the scores and the percentages that any of
the three leading teams, Collingwood, Geelong and
Melbourne, might have been pushed out of “the
four,” while no man could say for certain which
of the next three, Essendon, South Melbourne and
Carlton, would squeeze into fourth place. ’Wood was
meeting South, to which defeat would spell disaster.
South was outed by one goal, but in the last quarter,
facing a deficit of 25 points, it put up the fight of
its life, while the 30,000 barrackers roared and
yelled themselves into incipient madness. Scores:
’Wood, 63 points; South, 57. An equally stirring
finish was staged at Essendon, where the local XVIII
played Carlton. By superior marking and combina-
tion the ’Dons got a 4-goal lead and held it till but
15 minutes were left. Then the Blues, by concerted
rushes, got within three points, but the ; ’Dons
launched a last attack, scored a goal and the game
was over—’Don, 86 points; Carlton, 77. Of the
others, Geelong raised its percentage nearer ’Wood’s
by piling up 130 points to Richmond’s 66; ’Roy-
collected a quite unnecessary 120 to North’s 85;
Melbourne gathered in 140 to ’Scray’s 68; and Saints
notched 86 to Hawthorn’s 70.
THE AMAZONS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“Mrs. Clemington Corson, who swam the Channel
the other day, points out that while women are
creating records in athletics, men are standing still,
and anticipates that the former will be the stronger
and more prominent sex in 1976.”
“Sister, old ideas are fading. All arenas you’re
invading
Where for centuries you never were allowed.
In a House once solely manly you may hear Miss
Preston Stanley
Chopping logic with the coated, trousered crowd.
You have stormed the ramparts legal, beaks and
juries to inveigle;
In Macquari e-street; your shingles you have set.”
“Right,” she answers, “and the humming times will
very soon be coming
When we’ll towel you in athletics, don’t forget.”
“Sister, dainty-garbed and scented, won’t you, can’t
you be contented
With now and then producing a Suzanne?
Haven’t you made our cup a brimmer with a lady
Channel-swimmer,
Nay, a pair, in faster time than any man?
What new heights d’vou purpose scaling, in what
struggles fresh prevailing
Over him who used to be your lord and king?”
And she answers, “Why, we’re going next to wallop
you at rowing,
Running, cricket, football, wrestling and the ring.”
“Sister, sister bloused and skirted, will you elbow
out the shirted
Gladiator from the thrilling, stirring Test?
Will you prove in future clashes for possession of the
Ashes
That the female of the species is the best?”
And she answers sweetly, nicely, confidently, “That’s
precisely,
When some future team’s selected, what you’ll find,
And the ban on wives amended, inside-outed and up-
ended—
It’s the husbands then who’ll have to stay behind.”

Wilfrid Molony succeeds Dr. Patrick
Sheehy as sub-editor of the Catholic Press,
Sydney’s official R.C. organ. For the last
three years he has been on the Evening
News, but prior to that put in considerable
time on the London Catholic Times and
Reynolds’s.
“C.Q.”: The Windsor Hotel, the Mel-
bourne hostelry opposite Federal Parliament
House, has got itself into a form of litigation
unique for a public house. It recently
launched a quiet, well-dressed and entertain-
ing magazine and called it the Windsor.
It is now facing au action by Ward, Lock
and Co., London, publishers of the long-
established monthly of the same name, for
infringement of copyright “with intent to
deceive.” Bung claims that his venture is
purely a house-organ, but plaintiffs produce
copies alleged to have been bought at a rail-
way bookstall.
“Tarrawingee": Poolamacca, the Far
Western (N.S.W.) station from which the
owner’s small child lately wandered, leading
to a search in which over 300 motor-cars
and an aeroplane joined, has been put into a
hundred of Rod Quinn’s verses. Thirty years
ago, when Rod was looking for color, he was
taken to Poolamacca by the then owners,
the Broughams; and Johnny Brougham was
the “old Hospitality” of many of Quinn's
bush verses. There the gentle poet stayed
for a year. Another frequent long-distance
visitor was Ted Dickens, Charles’s youngest
son; he and Brougham had married sisters.
The sale of the West Australian has
gone through all right; and a co. has been
registered in Perth to run it. For the pre-
sent, at any rate, no changes are to be made
in the staff, and D. D. Braham, who came
from London Times to edit Sydney Daily
Telegraph, will remain in the chair. Peters,
by the way, had been practically chosen for
the Sydney job, when there descended upou
the directors from London an avalanche of
testimonials which suggested that the world’s
greatest journalist was knocking at the
D.T.’s door. Peters was forgotten in the
excitement —to be sadly remembered a hun-
dred times afterwards.
The Argus is doing things in style. It
has invited everybody who is anybody to an
inspection of the new Elizabeth-street
palace; and St. John’s Anglican Church in
Latrobe-street, in association with the
Wilson-Mackinnons, is running a special
dedication service, to which all the Inky Way-
farers (denomination immaterial) have been
invited. A special souvenir number, descrip-
tive of the life of the Argus and the pro-
gress of Melbourne, will be issued. Inciden-
tally, a queer ’graph in the vestibule of the
Argus to prove, that the news-
paper was the first published in Melbourne.
It arrives at this by recalling that the first
paper was the manuscript Advertiser,
owned by John Pascoe Fawkner; that the
second paper, the Port Phillip Patriot, was
also Fawkner’s; that the Patriot later be-
came the Melbourne Argus, which still
later became the Argus.
“Hamer”; Armidale (N.S.W.) used to
know a humorous little battler who ran
the Argus against the opposition of the
long-established Chronicle and the Ex-
press. He had cultivated a natural resem-
blance to Mark Twain, so of course he got
that name. His journalistic specialty was
giving a lift to local identities and families
that liked t'o see their names in print, and
he was proud of getting ahead of his rivals
with news. His hurry led to a few acci-
dents. I was in his office when a vexed
citizen came in and complained about hav-
ing been reported dead. The editor was
not a bit perturbed. “Well,” he said, “some-
one told me you were dead; and it was a
very nice obituhry, wasn’t it?” The un-
deceased fumed: “That’s all very well; but,
dammit, I’m not dead!” Mark Twain pre-
served his calm. “Apart from that, what
we’ve sipid is absolutely correct, isn’t it?”
he blandly asked.
“John Cow” : The Alert, of Maryborough
(Q.), a pioneer Labor newspaper, has at its
head William Halliwell Demaine, one of the
most picturesque characters in Australian
journalism.* Demaine was really the father
of the New Australia (Paraguay) settle-
ment. A ' stockily-built Yorkshireman of
vigorous speech but genial nature, he
migrated to Uruguay, where he pastured
sheep. Coming thence to Queensland, he
helped to found the Queensland Labor party
in the early ’nineties when membership thereof
was not, as now, a way to Easy-street, but
meant social ostracism. His glowing ac-
counts of the great Pampas country fired
the imagination of Lane and his friends, and
sent them to their Utopia across the seas. As
president of the Central Executive of the
State Labor Party he played a leading part
in perfecting the machine that hoisted Ryan,
Theodore and McCormack to power. Though
lie has helped many a politician to victory
he has never aspired to legislative office, and
only entered tlje Upper House of Queens-
land to help in wiping it out of existence.
“H.M.”: There was history attached to
the old table at which Mrs. Nacnamara sat
near the Palmer-street Public School, Syd-
ney, to advise electors to vote with the Noes.
Mrs. Macnamara, who was Henry Lawson’s
mother-in-law, has been part of the Labor
movement since its days of infant innocency,
and her home was a great meeting-place for
radical scribblers. Her husband was an
A.W.U. organiser who opened a bookshop in
Castlereagh-street, near the old Standard
Theatre (both are now gone), where the most
advanced literature of the world could be
obtained. His widow carried on the book-
shop and his enthusiasms when he died. Many
Labor leaders lodged over the shop and owed
rent in the old times; the table at which
Mrs. Macnamara sat had been thumped by
Hughes, Holman, McGowen and other Labor
lights of long ago; and Henry Lawson had
toiled painfully at it. For Henry wasn’t a
fluent writer. ITe was often weeks incubating
a set of verses; and when he had put them
on paper there might be half a dozen alter-
native readings of a line or a phrase to
choose from. But he remembered every line
he had ever written, differing greatly in that
respect from Rod Quinn, who, when a line
of his is quoted, is always liable to gently
affirm that he never wrote such nonsense in
liis life.

OBJECTS OF THE COMPANY.
This Company has been formed to acquire the Australian Patent Rights,
Manufacturing Processes and Sole Rights of Manufacture and Sale for Australia
of Rapson Tyres; all improvements that may be made from time to time, the Sole
Rights to Manufacture and Sell or to Act as Agent for all other Rapson Produc-
tions. Full information concerning this Rapson All-British Tyre and its phenomenal
successes and as to the other Rapson goods is given in the prospectus. The
demand for Rapson Tyres in the home markets has been greatly in excess of the
production of the British Rapson Factory, and supplies for the Australian market
have been restricted. Nevertheless, with comparatively little advertising, a rapidly
increasing demand for Rapson Tyres has developed through distributing agents
in every State of the Commonwealth. Rapson Tyres in Australia have upheld the
name “Rapson” has earned throughout the British Isles, on the Continent, in
America, Africa and elsewhere. Features unique to the Rapson Tyre which
prolong its life even under the most trying travelling conditions far beyond the
mileage of the tyres in general use should result in the Australian Rapson becoming
the SUPER TYRE OF THE COMMONWEALTH. The Company intends to
cater for a high-class trade, and Rapson Tyres can be confidently expected to
reduce the existing extensive demand for the better-grade imported tyres. The
Rapson Tyre can be placed on the Australian market at prices substantially under
those ruling for all well-known imported makes. The Rapson will be, offered as a
superior tyre adaptable to all classes of cars, ideally suited for Australian travelling
conditions, and giving service that will establish its reputation as THE MOST
ECONOMICAL TYRE on the market.
ESTIMATED PROFITS.
The estimate of the Company's profits is based on the actual experience of the English Rapson Company, due allowance being made to amply cover the additional
cost of manufacture due to the difference between English and Australian manufacturing conditions.
The Prospectus fully sets out estimated profits totalling £126,250 per annum from the first unit of the Factory. The highly profitable conditions experienced by
other Australian Manufacturers confirm the forecast of the capacity of this Company to earn remunerative rates of dividend.
The abridged prospectus is not a prospectus within the meaning of the Companies Act 1915. A full prospectus may be obtained from

Disapproving relations won over by the
sweetness of Cinderella have always been a
useful adjunct to the Cinderella story; and
“Brown Sugar,” which opened at Sydney
Criterion on Saturday night, is another ver-
sion of a narrative which the stage world
has over-used lately. Stella Deering, who
marries Toddles and becomes Lady Sloane, is
the Brown Sugar—sweet but unrefined—who
causes consternation among his haughty kins-
folk and places herself in melodramatic cir-
cumstances of suspicion before the plot is
ripe for development to its syrupy conclu-
sion. To redeem her brother-in-law Archie
from the clutches of the amiable Orobie Car-
ruthers, who makes living on liis friends a
business, Stella obtains a thousand pounds
from her infatuated husband; catching her
in the act of paying a cheque for that
amount to Carruthers with a remark that
enables her to jump to the conclusion that
it is hush-money, Lady Honoria Nesbit
(whose enmity is explained by the fact that
she once regarded Lord Sloane as her own)
makes the worst of it; the truth, and the
knowledge that Stella preferred to suffer
undue suspicion rather than expose Archie
to censure, causes the haughty family to fall
on the sweet lady’s neck.
I** * *
Stella, who, for the purposes of the play,
has to spend the greater part of two acts
on the penitent form and goes to what
appear to be unnecessary lengths to get
there, was played by Renee Kelly, whose
emotional moments were signalised by top
notes rather like those a tramcar makes when
protesting against a curve. Still, her per-
formance can be classed as good, although
it lacked finer lights and shades. George
Barraud showed his usual easy style as Lord
Sloane, the agreeable youth who is at the
one time a gallant, satisfying young husband
and a filial son (a dual role in real life very
hard to sustain when the family earthquakes
come) ; Jackson Wilcox put some good
touches into the part of the Earl-father;
Anthonv Holies found his smile the usual
asset as the cub, Archie; Reginald Wyke-
ham, as Carruthers, and Hylton Allen, as the
entrepreneur, George Edmundson, did their
share; and, amongst the women, Emma
Temple was, as usual, efficient as Mrs. Cun-
ningham, Margaret Darner better suited than
usual as the Countess of Knightsbridge, and
Dorothy Fane remarkably cattish as Lady
Honoria. Gwen Burroughs added a spice of
comedy to the last act as the Square Jane
secretary at the London Palladrome. It
earned her a special round.

“Brown Sugar” will be served at the Cri.
until September 22; three days later Mos-
covitch starts with “They Knew What They
Wanted.” “Rose Marie” will be in its 16th
week (at eight performances a week) on
Saturday, and Sydney is not yet leaving any
seats vacant; and “Mercenary Mary” has
every reason to gloat over the box-office re-
turns at the St. James. An old friend, ’ The

the Barrie cycle at the Royal on Saturday
next. At the Palace “The Sport of Kings’
is announcing its last nights; “The Best.

Bloke” is to arrive.

4 The Santreys, with a new programme,
remain the big imise at the Sydney Tivoli,
where the Sinclair Bros, are back with a
very good balancing act, and the Flying Win-
skills make hilarity out of attempts to break
their necks. A good bill.
The Midnight Frolics continue with un-
abated vigor at Fullers’ New Theatre. This
week “Our Parochial Gathering” is one of
the plums iu the pudding. In this show you
pays your money and you takes your choice,
as* the showman said when he was asked
which was the tiger and which the elephant;
if one of the flippancies fails, it is gone be-
fore the sense of bor has time to sink
in; and the turn which has danced in on its
heels is almost sure to bring amusement.
A picture, “Aeroplanes, Airships and Air-
ways,” which Keith Smith helps through
with a brief lecture, adds a very interesting
story of aviation progress to the Sydney
Lyceum programme. Tom Mix is “Hard
Boiled” at Hoyt’s. The film is at least
breezy, although the usual Tom Mixture.
“Shopliandled,” its companion, is a sordid
story whose jerkiness indicates that the
censor has been busy. It would be better to
refuse permission altogether for the screen-
ing of pictures that require wholesale hack-
ing before they are fit for view. “The Van-
ishing Race” is to complete its vanishment
after two more weeks, as far as the Prince
Edward is concerned; and —such is the
swank of the swankiest of modern picture
houses—the management is already inviting
bookings for the opening night of its next
picture, Harold Lloyd’s “College Days,"
which will be helped by the Hawaiian s. And
it is getting them, too—in shoals.
About a show of Yankee photographs:—
The old lady who, upon being shown a hippo-
potamus, remarked “I don’t believe it; there ain’t
no such animal!” can be excused by any dabbler
in pyro who takes a peep at the show made by
the Kodak 00. in Sydney. The exhibits are culled
from the pet prints of all the professional photo-
graphers of the country where lots of folk have a
lot of money and where a flattering picture of the
features of the rich commands a price that would
keep an English slum family in luxurious idleness
for nearly a year. The time has long gone by, of
course, when everything that was necessary in the
beautifying line could be done by a girl retoucher who
had learnt how to cover a varnished negative with
cross-hatching. Nowadays the theory that a photo-
graph cannot lie is circumvented by attention to
lighting. The movie industry has created an en-
tirely new technique in that respect—the technique
of artificial lighting—and the American professional
photographer of the higher class concentrates
upon it. What can be done by such attention
is demonstrated in the Kodak show. Society beau-
ties, stage beauties, the interiors of expensively-
furnished offices, the rugged lineaments of men who
have made piles and the beautifully-brushed crani-
ums of their nice-looking sons are all done most
magnificently. But best of all are the still-life
reproductions—pictures of brocade, of silver, of glass-
ware, of all that can contribute to the luxury and
convenience of life. An American still-life photo-
grapher could make a mud-pie look artistic and
interesting—given a sufficient number of very fierce
electric lights.
** * *
First-fruits of spring:—
The curious who try to look too closely into the
work of Sydney Thompson are liable to hurt their
eye against a projecting tree or fowl. A good customer
of the color-merchant, he produces a deal of
work that is bas-relief in paint; the confidence that
he has done what he wanted to do, which is adver-
tised by all his pictures, is very frequently justified,
though probably not as justified as the artist thinks.
The exhibits shown at the Macquarie Galleries, in
Sydney, are uniformly bold and vigorous. They
represent scenes in France, in most of which sun-
light effects are skilfully worked, although in a few
a tendency to sombreness approaches the drab. In
‘‘Blue and Gold —a Moist Evening” the sloppiness of
a sloppy world is indicated in a way that sends a
shiver to the marrow; “Breton Girl Darning” is a

lively portrait, with the intentness of its subject
very well indicated, silhouetted against a red cur-
tain in sunlight; and “Pardon at Troneon, Brit-
tany,” and “Oak-trees in Winter” are amongst the
others that most attract among the 39 shown.
The eight pictures hung by Leslie Wilkie in a
joint exhibition at the Hordern Galleries consider-
ably outweigh the 52, mostly potboilers, which are
the product of A. E. Macdonald’s industry. The
artists have exchanged compliments in the matter of
portraits; and Wilkie’s venture at depicting his
brother artist, though severe in style, is full of force
and life. Wilkie scores, too, with a crayon sketch
of C. J. Dennis and some nicely-wrought twilight
atmosphere in “Old Houses, Heidelberg.” A Paris-
green impression prevails in many of Macdonald’s
exhibits; the effect he secures may be correct in
some instances, but generally looks unreal. A large
canvas showing “Canberra, 1913,” is backed by a
key-plan of the locality. It may have historical
value, but is the sort of thing to create gloomy for-
bodings in the breasts of those who may have to live
at the capital. One or two of the pictures—-“ The Last
Load” (No. 4), “A Summer Sea” (No. 3) and
“Midday Camp” (No. 9) may be mentioned—are
pleasing enougli; but the standard drifts down to
poor things like “U.S.S. Nebraska, Sydney, 1908,”
in which the warship looks like a poorly-made toy
model.
Howls to high Heaven are ascending from artists

severity of the standard by which the selection com-
mittee has judged the pictures submitted for exhibi-
tion ; hut the result of the free use of the pruning-
knife should make this year’s exhibition of the
Society of Artists, at the Education Gallery, better
than usual. It opens to-morrow, Friday. Showing
the same severity as with its own members, the
Society has rejected 260 out of the 350 pictures sub-
mitted by non-members. The total exhibits will be
less than 200, against about 300 in previous years.
i’f $
At least three Melbourne theatres are pre-
paring for an outbreak of fresh attractions on
the 18th; meantime business is proceeding
as usual. “The Sentimental Bloke” will
mend his ways for a few nights longer at
the King’s. “White Cargo,” at the Royal,
is feeling proud of its 216th Australian
showing. Maoriland will shortly be invited
to survey the effects of damp-rot on white
men in the tropics, though borer in suburban
houses is a more pressing problem over there.
At the Princess “Abie’s Irish Rose” is doing
reasonably well; “Our Liz” is a magnet at
the adjoining showhouse; and at _ His
Majesty’s inspectors of “Tell Me More” are
requested to be in their seats by five to eight to
enable Gee and Bluett and the rest to finish
their job before eleven. The strains of the
steel guitar still fill the air and a fair pro-
portion of the seats at the Athenseum.
* :|; jf:
Negro singers, dancers and patter mer-
chants remain the chief motes in Melboui'ne
Tivoli's current beam. Salerno commenced
on Saturday to demonstrate that the last
word has not yet been said on the subject
of juggling. Sadie McDonald, a lady who
dances to and with her violin; Arthur and
Darling, American pantomimists; the
sprightly Prince sisters: and an English
comedian named Pond, who is broad but not
deep, help to pass a satisfactory evening.
If Jim Gerald’s guardian angels ever
forsake him and he becomes the prey of. evil
spirits, they will probably induce him to
appear in a suit of clothes that fit him.
Meanwhile he reigns supreme in the affec-
tions of Melbourne Bijou patrons by borrow-
ing a coat from the largest member of his
troupe and clothing his lower end in pants
designed for Oscar Asche. The latest bubble
from his pen is a martial story that com-
mences at Broadmeadows, ambles safely
through the war, and finishes at the Armistice
without once encountering a bursting shell
or a whiff of poison-gas.

Rene Maxwell is being thrown in with the
pictures at Melbourne Majestic. This Aus-
tralian nightingale, who has been singing
in England and across the Strait, airs
a blojide soprano voice with the well-founded
conviction that it is worth airing. Her
repertoire is fresh, simple and Anglo-Saxon.

some entirely new electrical devices are
used for summoning the departed, should
be attended 'by all mediums wlaose psychic

word in blood-curdling and spectacular photo-
graphy, and was watched by a packed house.
A Melbourne mixture:
Harry McClelland’s art, as sundry discerning
critics quoted on the catalogue have o ser\e , is
full of energy and freedom; but judging by hi
show at the Athenamm, the freedom is that at a
person untrammelled by technique, and hence the
energy is apt to run to nothing. One or two items
in the display invite a halt. A claypit and a
horse under a dramatic light have a rude charm,
but the charm scarcely overcomes the ludene s.
The catlike lady with the haunting eyes who looks
out of No. 48 would inspire more enthusiasm it her
mouth and other features weren’t also haunted by
bad drawing. The long array of landscapes indicates
that this artist needs to produce less and observe
more. A painter blessed with freedom and energy
alone won’t make good pictures any more than a
free aud energetic cook will necessarily produce
light pastry. „ , ...
Across the street at Margaret McLeans retiring
studio is a little show of water-colors by Mrs. G.
Hartrick (Rose Walker) which aims at the target
of modesty and quite often hits the bull’s-eye of
achievement. As a poet of the back yard, the
ladv has a Japanese flair for making pictures out of
paling fences. One or two low-keyed stretches of
bay water are pleasant to contemplate, if too cold
to swim in. A girl with cool eyes looks out of
No. 40. Her name is Nancy, which is what it
should be, and she has the self-composure that comes
of sound breeding and good drawing. Nancy is a
thoroughly nice girl. .
At the Fine Art Society’s Gallery Buckmaster is
again up for inspection. This young man is still
in a hurry, but not in so much of a hurry as he
was last year. He still pastes his foregrounds in
with a brush bristling with impatience, but his
backgrounds and his general atmosphere seem to
have been lingered over with more feeling. He is
still drunk with light and color, which are safe
things for an artist to get drunk on; they are better
at any rate than sentimental prettiness. His still-lifes
are remarkable examples of finished painting. A
portrait of Captain Sydenham, R.N., is more an
advertisement of the gallant officer’s tailors than
the revelation of a soul; but a picture of an old
lady is penetrating. The sitter would be more com-
fortable if the piano weren’t trying to crowd her
off the canvas. The charcoal portraits are vigorous.
The dark girl in No. 50 is almost as crisp and
crunchy as a Lambert. The young man’s vision
isn’t very profound as yet, but doubtless profundity
will come later. Meantime he is the most encouraging
portent at present showing on the local horizon.

Adelaide Royal lias surprised itself by
settling down contentedly to a variety show.
It is a good one, Coram bringing something
almost new into the usual ventriloquist talk
and Rupert Hazell having some bright jests.
Niobe, the under-water marvel, and old-time
favorites Whitburn and Pope have just
been dropped into the programme. As for
the Irving midgets at the Majestic, they
are in such demand as to have tw r o extra
showings at the King’s—little used nowa-
days. The York has Reginald Denny on the
screen, developing the lamentable American
idea of the swindler-hero who is justified
and made rich by an eleventh-hour fluke;
West’s in “The Pioneers” give an Australian
bush study that is good in parts; and Won-
dergraph has Richard Dix, attractive as
usual.
“Curtain-Raiser’: The Carl Rosa Opera
Co. threatens to invade this continent next
year; and the J.C.W.’s also meditate a grand
opera season in 1927. Endeavors will be
made to avoid a clash of the two contin-
gents. The Carl Rosas are a marvellously
persistent crowd. They have toiled up-hill
and down dale, often in financial straits, for
the past half-century, and during that time
have trained most of Britain’s leading war-
blers. If the voyage to Australia comes off,
it will be the organisation's 58th tour.
“A.G.M.” (Loud.) : Frances Alda lias de-
serted her 10,000-dollar-a-year flat in N’York
and come to Europe for a summer holiday.
Her hospitality will reach a still greater
degree of splendor when she moves, to her
new villa on Long Island, which is "being
erected at a cost of 100,000 dollars, to be
ready this year. Her husband, Gatti Cazazza.
has completed a new contract with the Met-
ropolitan Opera; and while Alda is searching
Europe for amusement and artistic treasures
for the new home, he is content with the
amenities of a New York hotel. No Aus-
tralian-born vocalist can show such a pic-
turesque road to progress as this now highly
artistic singer, who began her stage career
with the Rickards Tivoli show in Bourke-
strcet, Melbourne.

Point
“L.G.”: “Caul-Boy’s” (B. 8/7/’26) fear
that the members of the Allan Wilkie co.
would be overlooked is groundless. Over
£2OO has already been distributed amongst
the players. A special fund was collected in
the Green Room Club ; and this, together with
the proceeds of the Geelong benefit (organ-
ised by the Gordon Art Club), is reserved
for the co. Wilkie requested Bob McLeish
and S. 11. Henry, prime movers of the fund,
to allot the money. The main fund will go
towards re-establishing the Shakspearean
venture ; and as this ensures more or less per-
manent work for some 30 people, relief will
be more lasting than the distribution of a
dole.
“John’s Wood” (Loud.) : Lord Latliom
has made another
attempt to secure
the favor of the
West End; but
“The Way You
Look at It,” at
the Queen’s, seems
doomed. In this
new ultra-modern
play he shows the
same intimate
knowledge of stag:
technique and. also
the same hectic
morals as in his
recent failure. The
most lenient of his
critics describe it
as nauseating. It
was booed on the
first night. The
luxury of the set-
ting, the daring of
the plot and the
position of the
author have for the
moment made it
the talk of the
town, but that
won’t last long.
“Flaming Youth”: “Is Zat So?” is given
by another of the almost-complete imported
companies now doing the Australian thespian
out of a job ; Moscovitcli brings an entire co.
with him; and E. J. Carroll, who ought to
be satisfied with the results he has secured
from local actors, is following “The Best
People” by importing “The Ghost Train”
with a ready-made co. The Fullers, who
have found profit in locally-built vaudeville,
are the best friends the Australian mummer
possesses. It is said that their argument
with Ward over the importing habit was a
warm one. Why should an imported co. be
necessary for “The Best People,” for in-
stance—even if it was necessary to bring
The Best People”?
“Curtain-Raiser ’: . When the mythical
Hoyt, Esq., of the pictures, announced that
this was the month for celebrating bis birth-
day, a Melbourne reporter rushed to get a
story about the founder’s childhood—how,
for instance, he supported his aged mother by
selling newspapers while he experimented
with a cheap magic-lantern in the wash-
house ; how from the wash-house he rose to be
a, millionaire; how he gave free shows for
war workers and thus became an 0.8. E.;
and how he paid £lOO,OOO into the National-
ist party funds and became a knight. On
inquiry, however, the dream of Sir William
Hoyt, 0.8. E., faded. When Arthur Rus-
sell, a dentist, went into the Melbourne pic-
ture industry he chose “Hoyt” as a trade-name
merely because it was short and sharp.
“Jones John”: Australia is on the verge ol’
being found out by Hollywood. A big movie
man writes that there arc signs of “discover-
ing” us. “They’ve about exhausted this coun-
try,” he writes, “for out-door dramas (“horse,
operas,’ as tliev arc called) ; and Australia,
being a country none of them know much
about, offers tempting possibilities—especi-
ally as no one has to prove what he shows
on the screen.” Eva Novak is evidently the
Captain Cook on this voyage of discovery.
“Goldilocks”: Australia's 17-year-old pic-
ture-producer George Palmer, who was only
15 when he started, has got “The North-
bound Limited” off the stocks; it is to be
given a private screening in Melbourne next
week. 'Pile feminine interest is sustained by
a daughter of Harold Nelson, the N.T.’s rep.
in the Commonwealth Parliament. The
youngster’s pluck and initiative deserve to
secure an increase in the bank balance lie
established with his first picture, “The Mail
Robber.”
“H.K.”: Another new Sydney , playhouse
rapidly advancing in construction- is the
Empire, which is being erected for a com-
pany headed by Rufe Naylor, the bookmaker.
Located in Quay-street, near the Central
Railway Station, it will seat 3300, and is
to be devoted to musical comedy at cheap
prices—from Is. to 4s. Promoters hope to
have it open by Christmas.
“Ilamfat”: Louise Lovely, whose real
name was Alberti until she married Wilton
Welch —on the stage in Australia, before she
went to America, she used the name of Gar-
basse —is adding a divorce to her other per-
formances since her return to Australia.
Apparently “Jewelled Nights,” which the
pair and others produced in Tasmania and
Melbourne, brought a new romance to her
husband ; and the Divorce Court’s order that
he shall return to Louise is awaiting his
obedience. The lady was not particularly
distinguished on the Australian stage, but,
going to America, found a better niche in the
pictures; and Wilton Welch, whose experi-
ence had been mainly with touring com-
panies, found America kinder than his own
country, too.
WELL AND TRULY NETTED.
GUEST : “What a putrid artist!”
HOST : “ That's my daughter.”
GUEST: “Er—I mean the pianist.”
HOST : “She's my wife.”
GUEST : “Er — er—I should say, the — er—composer of the music.”
HOST: “I composed it.”
“Jones John” : The only flaw in the artis-
tic picture “The Sea Beast,” now showing
in Sydney, is the lack of a whale. The
movie’s chief character is Moby Dick, an out-
size in cachalots; but though the. presence
of the wily old beast is cleverly indicated on
the film, the Old Man of the Seas does not
appear. Apparently wild, or even tame,
whales are not stocked in Holywood studios.
“Ox”: Captivating Edith Drayson, whose
death is reported from London, made her
last appearance in Australia with the Snap
co. in a successful season of five weeks at
Sydney Criterion last October. Her best
numbers were the Captain of the Guards
ballet (“Pom Pom”) and the snow scene, in
which she was helped by the clever children
of the Penguin ballet.
“Ibsenshavv” : John Galsworthy's “Escape”
(B. 26/8/'26) is the last play the author
will write —so he says. He is perhaps a
little piqued at the reception of his two
former pieces, which to read are interesting
enough, containing some excellent acting
scenes, but leave one cold. Galsworthy’s
failing as a dramatist is that he is too dis-
passionate. He will pose a vital problem,
but prefers to leave his audiences to solve it
according to their lights or their predilec-
tions. But he has contributed some notable
pieces to the stage, “Strife” and “Loyalties”
perhaps being the best of a long series.
SELF-MADE.
"She's a charming little study, that friend of Dauber's. I wonder
if he paints her?”
“No. It's all her own work.”
“Escape,” by the way. is an episodic sort of
stage play-—a kind of revue in dramatic
form, which shows that the best of play-
wrights move with the movies these times.
“Wigs”: Recent visits to cinema houses
have convinced me that the jazz motifs of
most of Uncle Sam’s picture plays have
practically killed dramatic acting. The
Yankee producers started by selecting for
their leading ladies chorus-girls and dancers
who couldn’t act for toffee. But they had
shapely figures and pretty, if expressionless,
faces; and much use was made of both assets.
When experienced—and, naturally, more
mature —actresses show up nowadays, their
efforts are received with derision by the
movie fans, who have been taught to believe
that million-dahler stars like Totty Few-
clothes and Flossie Showlady represent the
last word in dramatic art.
“Philin Up”: We have read a lot of puff-
stuff anent the fat fees paid by film pro-
ducers to novelists and playwrights for the
use of their works. Now Arnold Bennett
comes along to blow the gaff. ‘The Great
Adventure” brought him £2OO. “The Old
Wives’ Tale,” £6OO. “Milestones,” which
he wrote with Edward Ivnoblock, likewise
went for £2OO in England, but after its screen
success there was purchased for the U.S.A.
for £2OOO. It seems that the 50,000-dollar
film-story is as much a myth as the salaries
paid to the Hollywood film-stars. But there
is no myth .about the enormous profits made
by the American-Jewish fraternity that owns
the business.
“T. 0.1.”: Re John Bennett and Victoria
Theatre (B. 2/9/’26>. His co. consisted of
Mr. and Mrs. George Darrell, Mrs. Melville,
Miss Allnutt, William Andrews and wife
(Nellie Montague), W. G. Carey, John
Howe, Clifford, Jack Sweeney, Flexmore and
myself. With this co. Bennett, in 1872,
opened the “Old Vic.,” which stood where
now is McCathie’s. Tom Margetts sang be-
tween pieces. Garnet Walch, then a journal-
ist of Parramatta, wrote Bennett’s first
Christmas burlesque, “Trookalentos.” Charles
Warde was Clown and also scenic artist;
Flexmore was Harlequin; I was Pantaloon
and am the sole survivor.
“Peter Pan”: Why even our repertory
societies have shied off Galsworthy’s latest
plays ought to be obvious to “Wigs” (B.
26/8/’26). “The Forest” has scenes set in
dense African jungle, which would need a
large stage and larger finances. Also, it con-
tains only one female character, a native girl:
so repertory societies, with their numerous
lady members thirsting to act, would scarcely
select it. By the way, the role of the native
girl in the London production was played
by Angela Baddeley’s younger sister, Her-
mione. “The Show,” Galsworthy’s other
play, also presents many difficulties in cast-
ing and staging.
“A.H.A.”: Genuine repertory efforts in
Australia usually reach Queer-street; but
Adelaide, thanks largely to Alec Melrose,
lias its own theatre and money in the bank.
Victoria Hall is a teal theatre, with SPh
lighting, a big stage and a following ot oi
repertorianS. The enthusiasm of Mr. am
Mrs. Wilfrid Neill and T. 11.. Nave, who pro-
duce the plays in turn, has made the theatre
almost an agreeable necessity in Adelaide s
life. Wilfrid Neill adds to his enthusiasm
for the drama a strong business sense, l lis
objective, nearing success, is to make each
play pay for its own production, apart rrom
the members' guinea, subs. He has done
“Getting Married,” “The Dover Road and
others; and the Australian drama is never
forgotten. The forthcoming production is
“Marty,” by a local writer, Alec Symons.
“P.W.R.”: There was never any mystery
surrounding Wilde’s “For Love of the King
(B. 5/8/’26), and it was not stolen m manu-
script from the
author’s house in
Titc-street at the
time of his tragic
eclipse. “Sliel-
bourne” is evident-
ly confusing this
with “The Por-
trait of Mr. W.
H„” the . manu-
script of which was
stolen, but recov-
ered and published
in 1921. “For Love
of the King” was
written not for
publication, but as
a personal gift to
the author’s friend
and friend of his
family. Mrs. Chan
Toon, who was
Miss Mabel Cos-
grove before she
married a Burmese
gentleman, nephew
of the King of
Burma. The late
Robert Ross much
wanted to include
it in an edition of
Wilde’s works, but
could not obtain the owner s consent.
Methuen’s printed it in 1922.
“P.P.” : The way of the Sydney dramatist
is hard. I had just put the finishing touches
to my one-act play, “Wooed and Won in
Woolcott-street,” when that romantic spot
was re-christened. Now I suppose 1 must
call the dashed thing “Dirty Work at the
Cross-road.”
“Pish-Tush”: The Gilbert and Sullivan
cult, which still has its roots deep in Eng-
lish suburbia, is being torn by a strange
heresy. It has been decided to re-design
the scenery and costumes of “The Mikado,”
which still remain practically as the original
producer, W. S. Gilbert, approved them. The
new costumes will be designed by Charles
Ricketts, A.R.A., from Japanese pictures, to
produce “a seventeenth-century atmosphere. ’
But what can Ricketts do? Jap costumes in
the 1880’s, when “The Mikado” was first
staged, were those that had been worn for
1000 years or more.
“Clos V.”: Despite “W.L.” (B. 2/9/’26L
Brisbane Repertory’s production of “Can-
dida” was an artistic success; and the cast
was up to a high professional standard. The
lady who played Candida was for years a
professional actress; and I doubt if any pro.
in Australia, except Frank Harvey, who is
here no longer, could have bettered Mr.
Devereux’s Marchbanks. There is far too
much cant talked on the professional side
.about repertory. Intelligent, well-educated
amateurs can give as good performances of
literary plays as professionals, if the pro-
ducer knows his job.
“Flaming Youth”: One of Jimmy Mar-
tin’s roughest experiences came when an
almost stranded theatrical co. in Maoriland
found itself short of fares to the next town.
As the beneficent Government railways pro-
vided a truck free of charge for the convey-
ance of the effects of theatrical cos., a way
out . was visioned by travelling a member in
an empty piano-case. Jimmy drew the lot
which obliged him to proceed in this way,
and, with the solace of a couple of bottles
of beer, he foupd the trip endurable. Unfor-
tunately the railway employees who helped
to unload the truck guessed the contents, and
amused themselves by rolling it over. When
the enraged mummer was finally released he
called the gods to witness that before he
would travel in the same fashion again the
management would have to make the bribe
* at least a half-dozen bottles.
“Whiteway” : Hilda Spong lately tried her
luck in America with a vaudeville sketch
which went well, and subsequently appeared
in a revival of “Lady Huntingdon’s Experi-
ment” at the liitz Theatre, N’York.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Madge Titheradge is
soon to have another season in America,
where she made an extensive tour with the
late Lewis Waller quite early in her career.
She is to have the leading rdle in a new play
by Noel Coward, which is to test the favor
of the New York public before being tried
in London.
THE BRUNETTE’S PULL.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“The drawbacks of summer are felt more heavily
by blondes than brunettes; mosquitoes, for instance,
greatly prefer the former.” —An English doctor.
Time was I longed for golden hair
And cheeks of cream and roses,
Like Rosamond “whom men called fair,”
With justice, one supposes;
And eyes of azure deep and pure,
Hymned in a hundred metres,
I reckoned held the most allure
For suitors, but I’m not so sure
I crave them yet.
Though blondes may get
More yearning looks upon them set,
They also tempt the skeeters.
Was she a less desired prize
Whom Tennyson discovers
“With swarthy cheeks and bold black eyes”
And plenitude of lovers?
‘ With Egypt’s queen in pomp and swank
They drank their wine by litres,
They did their dash by Nilus’ bank
And Cleo. had her skin to thank
’Mid dalliance gay
And amorous play
That she could go decollete
And never feed the skeeters.
She may incite regard more fond,
Inspire more burning passion;
The pink-and-white and golden blonde—
Now blondes arp in the fashion —
More sonnets to her eyebrows get
From ardent lyric bleaters.
But there’s a quid pro quo, you bet,
For every Sydneyside brunette;
Her cheeks may make
Less hearts to break,
But stiil she won’t be kept awake
To furnish food for skeeters.

Two Open Letters:
I.—TO THE INVESTORS OF
AUSTRALIA.
GENTLEMEN,—
If you have any money to invest,
just hold it until you read the
official prospectus of the GREAT
WESTERN PORTLAND CEMENT
AND LIME COMPANY, LIMITED,
which, in the opinion of that well-
known authority, Mining Engineer
H. E. White, F.1.A., F.N.Z.1.A., is
the “greatest cement proposition in
Australia, if not in the whole world.’’
Those of you who invested in the
Kandos Cement Co., the Standard
Cement Co., or the Portland Cement
Co. know what great money-making
propositions those concerns have
been for you. All I will ask you to
do is to probe the prospectus of the
GREAT WESTERN PORTLAND
CEMENT AND LIME COMPANY,
LIMITED, and see for yourselves
what marvellous facilities Nature has
provided for the most economical
possible production of cement at the
site controlled by the new Company,
with coal, limestone, shale and abun-
dant water almost within a stone’s
throw of the proposed works.
I would remind the hundreds of
thousands of investors in Common-
wealth and State bonds throughout
Australia to remember that I have
never yet made a mis-statement or
an overestimate in connection with
my Loan-raising activities covering
hundreds of millions of pounds.
Nor have I ever yet made a failure
in connection with any of my public
financial campaigns.
In the meantime,
I am, yours faithfully,
G. M. DASH
(Controller of the Underwriting
Group).
No. 2.—TO ALL MY OLD
COLLEAGUES—
Share Brokers, Solicitors and Share
Salesmen throughout Australia.
GENTLEMEN,—
Please get in touch with me either
personally or by post, as there is big
money to be made in connection with
this great Cement proposition.
Other, and even bigger, ventures
are to follow when this one is com-
pleted. We must push Australia and
Australian industries along.
Yori and I have worked both suc-
cessfully and profitably in numerous
public campaigns. A golden oppor-
tunity now awaits you to help Aus-
tralia and help yourselves in the
sphere of commerce.
Awaiting your early replies,
I am, yours sincerely,
G. M. DASH,
September 4, 1926.

Auction Sale.
MO N D A Y (POLLOWING ROYAL SHOW ),
27th SEPTEMBER, 1926.
AN EXCEPTIONAL OPPORTUNITY.
Important sale of the “Comelybanks” pure registered
Jersey Herd “Twylish” blood, with wonderful test
performances.
At NEWMARKET.
ADAMSON, STRETTLE and CO. PTY., LTD.,
pure stock salesmen, 482 Bourke Street, Melbourne,
Vic., have received instructions from Messrs W. and
G. Finn, of Comelybanks, Bundoora, to sell, on above
date, the whole of their high-class Jersey herd, owing
to a dissolution of partnership, comprising:—
30 stud cows and heifers, including prize takers
Royal Show, and winners of the Government
herd test, 1924, showing the remarkable aver-
age of 447.531 b. butter fat, twice a day
milking.
12 stud bulls, including the stud sire “Lily’s Lad
of Holmwood” (1051) and “Twylish” or
Comelybanks” (2419), both being by the
invincible dual purpose sire, “Audrey’s Lord
Twylish” (985).
The “Comelybank” herd is practically “Twylish”
blood, a.nd over a series of 5 years’ tests the aver-
age, including first class heifers, runs to over 4001 b.
butter fat per head for the 273 days’ test. This will
satisfy; the most fastidious as to dairy quality.
Buyers of Jersey stock in this State have never
before had an opportunity of selecting from a line
of cattle so high in all round standard as is here
presented them.

G. 8.: The sestette doesn't close we 11....
Spadge: Condensed, it would make a very good Abo.
par Kaloola: You may be right; all the same,
the first writer has been over 40 years in the business.
. ...J.McG.; Sorry, but MS. of unaccepted pars,
cannot be returned... .James G.: “Lunar microbes
seethe” —to rhyme with “’neath”—is moonshine....
A.McK.: Verses are mere carpentry; now use elbow-
grease and a plane on them.... Leone R.: When you
talk like that of “Love Kings,” The Bulletin is
a republic.. . .Mary W. L. R.: “Immigrant” should
gain admittance elsewhere... .G.S.C.: Your epic
has some points; but we derived most joy from
the iceberg whose “eye was bright,” and “such are
fit mates for Eastern potentates, in luscious dalliance
on their bodies battening”. .. .M. 5.8.: No less tame be-
cause you stage it in South America... .Thursday: Like
a vague rumor whispered hoarsely by a phantom....
D.F.G.: You didn’t send us the verse; you sent
the sheet the well-inked fly had crawled over....
Phil R.: Too rough; also too 10ng... .W.J.T.: Main
fault about the story is that it isn’t one. .. .G.R.H.:
After the first stanza our heart broke, and we read
no further
Weep, weep, weep, for Joy is not no more;
Let your sad tears down haggard cheeks outpour.
Kind will be Heav’n when He doth give you sleep
To end your earthly sorrow. Oh, weep, weep, weep!
. ...R.A.P.: Only the wifebeater who does the job
joyously is worthy of a story. .. .Sappho: Decline to
regard hubby’s nights at the club as a reasonable
excuse for his wife’s elopement even with his best
friend... .S.C.M. : No cheque for “Mortgaged.” Only
a check... .T.M.G.: About as funny as an average
imported comedian... .D.P.: The humor which causes
“Ah!” to be written “R!” is too cheap... .5.0.5.:
When a writer puts a story into short skirts it
should have shapely pins, at least. Yours has hardly
a leg to stand 0n... .C.P.L.: The Great Australian
Desert is a flood compared with the dryness of
your yarn about it....R.M.: “Heart of the Bush”
sounds hollow T.S.H.: Dull W.T.Z.: Merely
a rhymed advertisement... .L.O’M.: Not much illumi-
nation in “Headlight”... .E.F.W.: Not having a
nursery, cannot use “Error in Judgment”....
J.M.T.Y.: Your effort to rhyme “antinomian” with
“woman” is heroic, but not poetry... .Sunset: Authors
who, instead of “went fishing,” write that people
“endeavor to lure to their ruin the dwellers of the
deep,” have usually very little to say.... R.M.: What
has the homely, helpful article done to you that
you consistently omit it?.... Olive K.: Good, for a
first story, though immature... .G.P.R.: “Fisherman”
doesn’t get a bite.... San Toy: Your “Spring” is
as attractive as the rusty one which sticks out of a
cheap lodging-house sofa.... Gas N.: Your description
of the lady who was uncertain of her feet demands
admission:—
She was a fallen woman, but she had not fell so far
As many painted females in homes or city bar.
It wasn’t for fine furs or gems, or hats upon her head;
The reason she fell constantly was for her babies’
bread.
. ...A.F.R.: “The Flag” droops after the first verse.
... ..D.A.P.: Your attempt to rhyme “kettle” with
“boiling” was only a partial success. .. .Will C.:
Point might go in less than half that length and
(in parentheses) we don’t like (that is, very much)
this (which is to say, parenthetical) method of writing.
... .Royalist: You have sent a copy of those verses
to 'the King, have you?. God save the King! —.
Della: “The Pale Lady” is painfully thin... .E.M.E.:
“The Fortunate Stranger” is a dull person.... Don
H.: Interested to read that your hero was “a con-
firmed septic.” Who confirmed him ?. .. . J.W.: Poor.
. ...J.A.8.: Here is all that matters of your heart-
less jest:—
Poor Billy’d like to fill with beer
Till he was all a-slant,
But water fills his billycan
Because poor Billy can’t.
.... Jeff W.: Every budget from you brings its
bloodstained corpse. If you must have a murder, Mr.
Deeming, do try a cheerful one. .. .Horatio B.: Ah,
what a fall was there, Horatio!.,. .D.L.M.: Yarn
about policemen is mere 510p5.... Tom D. W.: You’d
“howl my love-song to the gale,” would you? You’ll
have a boot thrown at you if you come near our
window... .L. 8.: “Judas” gets no thirty pieces of
silver here... .G.A.R.: Your wintry “December” cuts
no ice in this country... .Tare: Yarn about man who
told “ ’Ow ’lggs spelt Hautumn with a haitch”
shouldn’t take 2000 words... . J.E.F.: They are
terrified by a tramp; but it turns out to be aunty.
Well, we 11!... .M.K.: “The Swagman” tramps pain-
fully on well-corned feet... .C.R.V.: You’re a cheer-
ful spring poet, you are—weeping because “grey-
lmired Winter’s dead”.... Etta T.: Mere remark that
spring is here and the brown leaves are now green
is not inspiring. .. .W.C.: Clip your “Bushman’s”
whiskers and send him in again—. Joy B.: Just
fails... .V.G.W.: One has a chance... .R.E.8.: Your
verbal conjuring tricks not skilfully enough managed.
.... J.D.V.: The story in its new suit fails to please....
S. : The usual bathos, made more grotesque by
associating the memories of her with the teddy-bear.
.... T.C.8.: Idea in “Sins” would do if the rhymes
(some doubtful) were not just thrown together. But
get another pen-name; “The Breaker” has a dead
man’s mortgage on it. ...F.M.: “The Three Winds”
are blowing back to you. They are too fitful....
T. : “Rubbish” is not quite as bad as that;
but it is mostly mere jingling sounds.... J.H.D.:
Story spoilt in the telling... .Patro: If it gets round
how often you rhyme “failure” with “Australia”
some patriotic citizen may kill you with one of your
own heavy doggerels.... H.J.M.: That paddock
pretty well stripped.... Charles H. S.: Very nearly;
but there’s a bit too much of the slapstick about it.
. ...Wab: Not a quarter of them. If, for instance,
we think a writer might be able to sell his yarn or
verse to another paper, we don’t usually mention it
here unless there’s some special reason for doing so.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CORRESPONDENTS.
F.M.: Worms that have stayed out all night have
crossed our path before... .J.P.: Promising; strive
to get full value for every line placed on the
paper .Ink: More suitable for a children’s comic.
G.T.: A bit better; but the joke has appeared
in every comic paper from Copenhagen to Valparaiso.
. ...L.F.: Neither impressed nor amused J.D.:
Wash drawing reminds us of a mud geyser at the
top of its form. .. .M.M.: Nothing more than jnky
scribbles .M. 8.:. Maids a shingle short are barred.
... .C.A.R.C.: Pencil drawing of H.M.S. Renown well
done, but no use; we want the sort of stuff we print
and always want it better... .F.H.: The woman is
all bumps and her husband was tailored by an old-
clo’ man E.F.W.: Send something with life in it.

As Shakespeare says: “That is
the Question”
Eucalyptus Oil may be pungent or
extra strong, or may carry excessive
Kucalyptol, but is it a potent remedy
for human ills? Experts say* "No,
more harmful than helpful.”
Bosisto’s "Parrot” Brand Eucalyptus
is a Potent Oil—in other words, cura-
tive and heallngt truly medicinal, and
a powerful germicide.
As an embrocation, the genuine
BOSISTO’S promotes that delightful
feeling of suppleness beloved by the
nthlete; and how refreshing after
strenuous exercise!

Business, Robbery, etc.
“Coot”: On September 1 the time-ball
at Williamstown (Vic.) ceased work, after
66 years of it on the old lighthouse tower.
This structure is one of Melbourne's oldest
relics, a light having been first exhibited
from it on August 1, 1840 —SO years ago.
* * * *
“X2X” : At one spot on the North Coast
of N.S.W. there is a variety of black sand
which, when brought into contact with the
skins of bathers, produces a painful rash
resembling that which frequently breaks out
on the hands and arms of those who handle
radium without proper protection against its
rays. This fact alone should have been
sufficient to suggest a scientific investigation
of the stuff, but nothing has been done.
* ' * * *
“Milf”: A new one was worked on several
Melbourne pawnbrokers lately. One of their
regular clients had a fair-quality diamond
tiepin. They all knew it so well that lie
never had any difficulty in raising £lO on
it. One fine day he got eight different uncles,
all grown careless with familiarity, to lend
him the tenner, having thoughtfully provided
himself with eight excellent copies of the
original. None of his uncles has seen him
since.
* * * *
“C. 8.”: The “art-union” started in Aus-
tralia to finance the British seamen in their
strike last year has come to a luckless end.
Sales of tickets brought only £l6B into the
coffers, and as a free trip to England (pre-
sumably on a Jap or a German liner ) and £l5O
cash was to be the first prize, and, as all the
collections have been already spent, little
is being heard of the drawing, which was
billed to take place last January. Pre-
sumably, subscribers are now expected to
consider their contributions as gifts to the
Cause.

“Nikko”: The delectable Maoriland shell-
fish, the toheroa, has attained much popu-
larity among soup-suckers abroad; hence Gov-
ernment fisli experts, in order to protect the
industry, have deemed it advisable to encou-
rage its culture on suitable beaches where it
is not at present found. The west coast
beaches provide most of the delicacy, and be-
tween local consumption and the demand of
the exporting canneries their supply is not
far ahead of the demand. The toheroa is a
burrowing fish, and the amateur gatherer,
after having collected a neat little pile of
the creatures, may discover after a few min-
utes’ inattention that his catch has escaped,
having buried itself deep in the sand.
* *- * *
“S.M.”: Australian marine wages are
adjusted quarterly, and the adjustment so
far has been always upward—which has
made it easy to accept. The last little rise
took place the other day, and it had hardly
happened when the Merchant Service Guild
decided that there was no sense in making
two bites at a water-melon. So it demanded
that all officers should have a robust in-
crease, with certain side-lines, including 12
months’ notice of dismissal. Officers have
been poorly looked after hitherto; but this
last idea is calculated to provide a whole
cargo of contention. Twelve months’noi ice
is more than a president or a king gets nowa-
days. And it is certainly more than an
owner gets from either his employees or his
creditors.
* * * *
“Paroo” : The Queensland Government has
long realised that the profits of. beef barons
and similar exploiters of the masses are a
delusion. A few years’ experience as pro-
prietors of cattle-stations which were to
bring down prime sirloin to the price of
cat’s meat satisfied it, and it has been look-
ing for. a chance to unload at something
resembling a price. It long scorned to call
in outside assistance, but now Minister for
State Enterprises Gledson has shamefacedly
admitted he has been having “preliminary
discussions” with agents ; “in no case, how-
ever, will, the Government sell at a sacrifice.”
If Gledson imagines that any Queensland
cattle-station can be sold to-day at anything
but a sacrifice on its capital cost he is woe-
fully ignorant of his job.
“T.L.”: Uncle Sam may be annoyed at
the price he has to pay for rubber these
times, but “Buttenderry” (B. 5/8/’26) is
wrong when he asserts that Uncle is doing
“nothing of a practical and effective nature
to meet the situation.” It has been widely
published within the past few weeks that the
development of rubber plantations with
American capital is to be undertaken in the
Philippines. The Harvey Firestone Rubber Co.
lias been investigating this part of Uncle’s
territory, and found the soil quite suitable,
especially on Mendanao and the adjacent
islands. It is estimated that it takes five
years for a plantation to get into bearing,
and that within 15 years America will be
independent of foreign rubber. If at the end
of 15 years America is still using 75 per
cent, of the world’s output, it will be a bad
lookout for British interests, unless by that
time some other country—say, Australia—is
using as much rubber as the Land of the
Dollar requires to-day.
* * ' * *
Te Babarantiko”: The old and decrepit
Inca, now being faked up to look like a
convict ship for film purposes (B. 26/8/’26),
was the first five-masted fore-and-aft
schooner built on a Pacific shore. In July
1897, in a yard on Puget Sound (U.S.), I
Mewed the keel, stem and stern trees and
three ribs of a wooden ship which was
beginning to take shape. It was the Inca to be.
Vive-, six- and even seven-masted schooners
had sailed the great American lakes, but
none beyond four-masters had ventured upon
the Pacific. Many years later I saw the
Inca in Sydney Harbor. Despite her five
sticks she was inconspicuous beside the
largest sailing-ship built, the German five-
masted barque, the Marie Rickmers—the
latter had also an auxiliary steam-engine.
Thirty years ago old shellbacks gravely
doubted the possibility of such large vessels
being able to survive a heavy gale. When
the Marie Rickmers disappeared during her
first voyage, presumably in a typhoon in the
Indian Ocean, these oracles used it as evi-
dence in support of their contention. Some
of them lived to see steamers attain a size
beside which the great five-masters of that
day were pygmies.

The plates are the life of the battery. Too
much pressure in forcing lead oxide paste
into the plates makes a sluggish battery;
too little pressure makes a short-lived one.
When the work is done by automatic ma-
chines, it is possible to regulate the pressure.

“Angus O'Cohen”: A John Hop’s hoofs
may be more than an ornament, and a badge.
One was asked in the Christchurch (M.L.)
court recently how he had measured dis-
tances after an accident, and replied, "With
my feet.” He added that he allowed IS
inches for each, and it would bo right to
widin an absurrud decimal.
“Larool”: In at least one town in the
Flinders (Q.) it would want a black tracker
and a search-warrant to find enough petrol-
tins to build a dog-kennel, much less a house.
Motor-lorry loads have been carted from this
town in all directions to be converted into
troughs for feeding sheep. One selector
alone has between 600 and 700 tins put to
that use.
“S.R.M.” : When the deposit has been paid
on the near-bungalow, and the time-payment
furniture, pianola, gramophone, wireless set,
etc., have been moved in, the suburbanite is
faced with the problem of a suitable label
for his new home. I tender for his use the
name of a dwarf box-tree found on the banks
of inland rivers—the Goborro. One could
be grown in the front garden; it should at
least feel quite at home.
“Stellsby” : Strawberry can show sagacity
too. A woman driving a pet ram out of a
paddock at Scarsdale (Vic.) was flabber-
gasted when the woolly darling suddenly
turned, knocked her down and started butt-
ing. Strawberry, browsing near by with her
calf, noticed the woman’s predicament, trotted
across to her rescue and tried conclusions
with the ram. She routed him, saw the
woman safely on her feet again, and then
resumed the custody of her calf.
“N.K.C.”: I had been into civilisation
from my little Mallee school and brought
back a bag of bananas. It was wet and we
all lunched inside. Then I peeled a banana,
and suddenly found myself the centre of a
dozen pairs of eyes. “Is that a banana,
teacher —what you get from Queensland V”
It was the first the nippers had ever seen,
and of course I shared up. Next trip I’m
going to bring back a cocoanut —you don’t
see much from the great world in the north-
ern Mallee.
Florida (U.S.) has a burst land boom on
the premises, and the Federal Government,
perhaps having doubts about the State autho-
rities, is after the malefactors itself. The
weapon is one which might come handy here.
Uncle doesn’t prosecute for the actual
swindle, but for the use of his mail service
to promote the swindle. The method is prac-
tically valueless in the case of murderers, for
the corpse is seldom posted; but it can be
applied to almost any sort of bogus company
promoter, and there are plenty in these parts.
“J.’s Ass”: Maoriland’s ’bus regulations,
gazetted by an Order-in-Council, are being
openly flouted. Instead of the ’buses charg-
ing at least Id. more than the trams would
charge for the same distance, the former
vehicles now run with “Fares as Usual”
placarded all over them. The regulations
are disliked for obvious reasons by the
public, but it has been left to the Christ-
church Tramway Co. to change dislike into
a stronger feeling. Because a quarryman
w T ho had worked for the co. for years tra-
velled to his toil in a ’bus running in com-
petition with the trams, he was promptly
sacked.
“Wang”: Re spades as frying-pans.
There’s an old chap working for our local
council who regularly grills his steak on his
metal fork, and mostly uses his shovel as a
plate. When soup is on the menu the top
of his felt hat serves as a receptacle. He
has painted the outside of the crown with
some sort of varnish which makes it water-
tight, and a dent punched in the crown does
the rest. One day I asked him why he didn’t
use a soup-plate. “Me boy,” he replied,
“there’s some damn thieves would shake a
plate off a man; but they won’t steal me
hat.” I looked at it again and was con-
strained to agree that he was probably right.
Bishop Molyneux, of the Melanesian Mis-
sion, put up an argument in favor of “im-
proving” the British position in the New
Hebrides which comes oddly. He suggested
that, now that France is “in a bad state,”
there is opportunity for “British commercial
influences” to get a grip. Of course, behind
the good bishop’s advice to kick our neigh-
bor when he is down is the hope that an in-
crease in British control would mean a sharp
rise in mission prestige—the French have
little time for the missionary as such. But,
even so, it will hardly improve the French-
man’s opinion of his British guests to find
that they are suggesting that he be thrown
out of his own house while he is too ill to
resist.
“C.Q.”: Melburnians who buy their daily
paper in front of the Commonwealth Bank
in Collius-street deal with a quaint busi-
ness partnership. They are Wallic, a 15-
year-old lad, and Lass, a Russian terrier.
Wally found Lass on Port Melbourne beach.
She had that bright, expectant eye that
invites the passer-by to throw a stick and
she will show what can be done with it.
She followed Wally home and showed that
she could catch pennies, too. Between them
the firm collects a decent income; Lass gains
something extra for her owner occasionally
wdien a passer-by throws a silver coin for the
pleasure of seeing the dog catch it. Only
once has Lass betrayed her trust, and that
was when in an afternoon rush she swal-
lowed 6d. She returned even that as soon
as she could.
There is wonderful vitality about the oft-
told tale. This is from an interview with
Professor W. E. Cooke, the N.S.W. Govern-
ment Astronomer to whom the Lang Minis-
try gave the sudden ill-tempered sack: —
What astronomy has done for the world is known
to all. It was through astronomy that Australia
was discovered. Indeed, Captain Cook came out on
an astronomical investigation at Tahiti, and just by
accident found our great continent.
St. Peter’s School and Adelaide University
will be staggered to hear their talented son
perform like that in his 63rd year. Dates
are not easily packed goods; still, even a
professional mathematician might keep it in
his memory that the Dutch Leeuwin rounded
the point which bears its name, and
Arnhem discovered Arnhem Land, and the
Gulf of Carpentaria was named after Pieter
Carpentier, the Governor at Batavia, and
Tasman skirted the west coast of Tasmania
a century and a half or more before Cook
met this continent.

The King Lay Sick.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
THE King lay sick in the eastern
tower—
’Twas the Queen herself who tended
him,
Left her tabouret in her northern bower
To cool his lips at a goblet’s rim,
With her pearl-sewn sleeve held his dark
head up
That on healing simples the King might sup.
Grave doctors rustled in velvet cloak
_ With an ebon stick and a learned mouth
’Fill the King from a fevered stupor woke
And cried of a window facing south,
Of wild red roses like scented flame —
And his pillow muffled a foolish name!
So they called the Queen from the low prie
Dieu
Where she held a candle of finest wax,
Though a wind from the rainy fields crept
through
With a whiff of hawthorn and beaten flax;
And the King once more let his raised hand
fall
As he turned his face ,to the arrased wall.
The young Prince fretted for hawk and
hound,
_ And bit his knuckle and drummed a heel;
’Twas the longest waiting his youth had
found.
He began to ponder how sceptres feel:
The thought was dull, for wild-woods are
green,
And a gypsy wench may not make a queen !
And the Queen, who never had loved the
King.
Hid secret dreams as the taper burned ;
For the Prince, her son, was a weak-willed
thing,
And a likely Regent her heart discerned;
But the foul reproach none should ever bring
That she lacked in duty towards her King!
So she grudged herself e’en a moment's sleep
While she measured physics and spiced the
wine;
And she knew exactly how much to weep—
For a loving wife is a clinging vine;
And she proved what a loyal heart can bear
When the sick King frowned as he saw her
therH
Prom the dreary wastes of the blackened
plain,
With her eyes like night and her hair like
flame,
Through the unspent fury of wind and rain,
The King’s sweetheart from the forest
came.
In her cotton shift was no warmth at all,
But she stood all night at the palace wall.
When the wan wild sun in the hills had set
_ And the hooting owl from its caverns dvew,
While the dwarfs of the tempest spread their
net
To steal a star that the clouds let through,
With her small palms prest to the wall's wet
moss
And her arms outspread till she made a cross,
She heard the watchman call the hour;
She heard the chanting at evensong;
Heard them changing guard in the eastern
tower
And stood there, rigid, the whole night
long.
She spiced no cup—and she prayed no
prayer—
But I think her God saw her vigil there !
QUEENSLAND.
M. FORREST.
The Distressful Knight.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IP you go down to Sydney Cove (nowa-
days you must make inquiry for Cir-
cular Quay) and take ship for Wat-
son’s Bay, you will arrive, in the latter third
of the voyage, at the beautiful grounds of the
old home of William Charles Wentworth ; and
if you walk up to Vaucluse House you will
find the place full of memories of the great
man who lies buried close at hand- —such
memories of a good Australian as cannot fail
to move you if you yourself be one.
But the grey old house in the lovely garden
has memories that go farther back than
Wentworth’s strenuous years. They are
memories of one of the quaintest personali-
ties that ever came to dwell for a space be-
side Port Jackson —and there have been
many quaint ones, even to our own day. Part
of the tree-bowered building was erected by
an estimable, genial, hot-tempered gentle-
man out of Ireland, named Henry Brown
Hayes, lately High Sheriff of Cork, and, at
the time when he acquired the estate which
he named Vaucluse, a prisoner of the Crown
in his Majesty’s Territory of New South
Wales.
Sir Henry Brown Hayes—he was knighted
during his term of office as High Sheriff —was
a wealthy Irish gentleman who had fallen
foul of the law in a peculiar and diverting
fashion that was eminently characteristic of
him. \\ hy he, who had plenty of money of
his own, and none of the tenets that distin-
guish the 'Society of Friends, should have
wished to abduct a plain and unattractive
little Quaker heiress, has always been more
or less of a puzzle. But the fact remains
that he did so, failed to persuade her to
marry him, was prosecuted for the offence
some time afterwards, sentenced to death,
reprieved, and sent into exile oversea.
Prom the very beginning of his exile, and
almost all through the dozen years of its
existence —before the influence of his friends
and the recommendation of Macquarie pro-
cured him a free pardon in 1814—Sir Henry
found trouble. He succeeded in rendering
himself peculiarly obnoxious to the some-
what irascible Governor King, whom, for his :
part, he describes as a “man who, mistaking
arrogance for dignity, and caprice for wis-
dom, and power for authority, conscious,
solely of his own hereditary meanness, knows
no other way of aggrandising himself than
by the coarsest language and most brutish
behavior, degrading men down to his own
level, well aware they have not the power
left them of giving him the chastisement he
merits.” King had his own opinion about
Hayes, too. “The character of Henry Brown
Hayes,” he writes to Under-Secretary Cooke,
“is ivcil known. This troublesome person to
the most immoral practices has been a prin-
cipal in every infamous and secret attack
that he and his colleagues have made on the
reputation of- those who cannot sufficiently
despise their wickedness.” As Sir Roger de
Coverley used to put it, “Much might be
said on both sides.” It certainly was, and
in unmistakable terms.
Hayes was favored, owing to the influence
of his friends, and the wealth that was his,
by being permitted to pay for a cabin pas-
sage in the transport that conveyed him to
Australia. This was the notorious Atlas,
commanded by the infamous Richard Brookes,
owing to whose avarice, roguery and cruelty
to the prisoners aboard less favorably situ-
ated than Sir Henry, some sixty-five of them
perished, whilst the remainder reached
Sydney in an appalling condition of debility
and misery. “In order,” Hayes wrote to the
Secretary for the Colonies —“in order to
secure to myself a respectful treatment and
decent accommodation on board, I had paid
a considerable sum to Captain Brookes, com-
mander of the ship appointed by Govern-
ment. The Transport Board had also by
letter ordered Captain Brookes to receive
on board his ship a man named Jamieson.
Would your Lordship wish to know him? In
figure he resembles a Hackney chairman, in
behavior a clown, illiterate beyond measure;
stupid when sobei’, and when drunk out-
rageous. While we lay at Rio this man, in
one of his drunken fits, quarrelled with Cap-
tain Brookes, and they actually fought on
the quarter-deck. Compassion for a moment
superseding contempt, engaged me to join
the company in separating them. Our kind-
ness procured us all, and me in particular,
a volley of abuse in terms not calculated to
escape notice. On shore the next day, when
the fumes of his liquor wore dissipated, I
requested an apology and obtained satisfac-
tion. The steps I then took were those uni-
versally approved of. He went on board an-
other ship and I forgot him.”
But Dr. Jamieson did not forget Sir
Henry Brown Hayes. The ship in which
the surgeon continued his voyage from Rio
arrived at Port Jackson some time before
the Atlas reached there, and when Sir Henry
put in an appearance he found a warm wel-
come awaiting him. Jamieson had been
appointed a magistrate and Acting-Chief
Surgeon of the colony by Governor King.
After some bitter remarks concerning his
Excellency and Dr. Harris, the surgeon of
the N.S.W. Corps, the angry knight pro-
ceeds with his indignant complaint.
“To these two,” he says, “Jamieson wns
a valuable acquisition. A triumvirate was
formed, and in return for his confidence they
gave him theirs. Hence I was detained on
board, although exceedingly ill, a fortnight
after the ship was at anchor. Hence they
deliberated whether flogging, hard labor or
Norfolk Island (the ‘black hole of Botany
Bay’) should be my portion; and most cer-
tainly I had fallen a victim to their villainy
had not caution, my friend for this once only,
stepped in. They therefore gave me a kind
of mock trial for insulting in the Brazils
this colonial surgeon. The sentence passed
on me was six months’ imprisonment in the
common gaol. The consequence, additional
ill-health and unavoidable delapidation of
what effects I brought with me. My illness,
however, made them fear I might escape
their hands by death. They therefore, after
numberless wrongs, insults, scoffs and
threats, liberated me at the end of five
months, but, as an -additional inconvenience,
sent me to Parramatta under the penalty of
transportation to Norfolk if I ventured dowm
to Sydney, where my property was deposited,
a prey to the ravages and plunder of every
miscreant. This sentence, by extra ex-
penses, thefts and other delapidations of pro-
perty, cost me at the least £5OO. Since I have
been ordered to attend one of Governor
King’s musters among felons. A copy of the
ticket then given me I here subjoin :
No. 1 Prisoner’s Certificate.
The bearer, H. B. Hayes, has the Governor’s per-
mission to gain his livelihood by honest means; but
if he demands extortionate pay for his labor, or
transgresses any of the orders and rules of the
colony, he will be put. to Government labor, and
such other punishment inflicted on him as the magi-
strates may award; and of which all settlers, culti-
vators and others are to take notice.—W. N.
Chapman, Secretary. Muster, February 2, 1808.
I think I see indignation flash in your
eye, my Lord ; yet so it is, hourly am I ex-
posed to the grossest insults. Why? Be-
cause they can be offered with impunity.
Endless would it be to recount every indig-
nity. To your Lordship’s wisdom, protec-
tion and humanity I recommend myself and
this colony—a colony now nearly reduced to
the verge of destruction, and of too great
political consequence to be suffered to re-
main in such hands as those of Captain King
and Messrs. Harris and Jamieson, surgeons.”
* * * «
Down by the riverside at Parramatta Sir
Henry Brown Hayes sat upon the grass on
a March afternoon in 1803, smoking a clay
pipe and dangling a primitive rod and line
over the placid waters of the flooding tide.
There was an air of somewhat melancholy
dejection in his rounded shoulders, and his
not unhandsome face, with its fringe of
brown whiskers, was overcast with gloom
as he watched the cork with a stick stuck
through it that did duty as a float. Up
above and behind, on the higher bank, was
the little thatched hut which he had hired
a couple of convicts to build for him after
his release from Sydney Gaol and banish-
ment to the settlement at the extreme head
of the harbor.
Great gum-trees shaded the narrow head
of Port Jackson’s long estuary, and down
by the waterside shrubs and bushes grew
here and there along the narrow strip of
alluvial that stretched below either bank. It
was a warm day, and the long reach between
the tall trees gleamed brilliantly in the
wavering sunlight; but the dejected exile sat
in the cool shadow of a spreading she-oak.
On the grass beside him lay his tobacco-tin
and tinder-box, and an open copy of Swift’s
“Gulliver's Travels” was face upward upon
his other hand.

His pipe went out in an expiring curl of
blue smoke, and lie took it from liis mouth
and laid it upon the pages of the book. With
an impatient curse he jerked the float from
the water and laid the rod also upon the
grass, pointing upstream upon his left-hand
side.
“Damme,” he muttered, “I’ll fish no more.
Me luck’s clane out. ’Tis no luck at all I’ve
been having since ever I set eyes upon that
little Quaker baggage, Mary Pike. Good
Ged! To think o’ me, Harry Hayes, the
greatest man one time in all County Cork —-
entertainin’ the Judges and the Bar, and the
Lord Lieutenant himself- —dancin’ at Dublin
Castle —the pride o’ Sackville-street, when
I’d be walking down it —to think o’ me a-
sittin’ here, like a little blackguard gossoon
on th’ bank o’ the Liffey, with a stick and a
bit o’ string, a-fishin’ for fish that won’t
bite, bad luck to ’em—’tis enough to drive
a man into the rum-drinking habit, so it is.
Good Ged —good Ged! Hulloa, there, and
who the devil may you be, pray?”
Round the bole of the she-oak a queer-
looking figure of a man had stepped into the
knight’s cognisance, intruding upon his sor-
rowful meditations. So quietly had he come
that Sir Henry had been unaware of his
approach until the fellow stood at his left
side looking down upon him —a tall, cada-
verous, ragged scarecrow clad in tattered
garments that scarcely preserved the decen-
cies. He was shaggy-headed and shaggy-
bearded, with a skin that had been tanned
into leather by the sun, and bright, black
eyes staring out of deep sockets below over-
hanging black eyebrows, either of which
would have made a respectable moustache
for any young man of twenty-one.
“Dammit, me good fellow, don’t stand
there a-quizzing me as though I was a raree
show. What d’ye want?”
“Sure, thin, could y’r ’anner shpare me a
pipe o’ ’baccy? ’Twould be th’ first I’ve had
this two month pasht.”
Sir Henry picked up his tobacco-tin and
handed it to the man, who leant over and
snatched it eagerly. From some pocket in
his disreputable clothing he produced a black
dhudeen, stuffed it full with the knight’s
Cavendish and struck a light with the flint
and steel which the latter handed up to him.
He was such a gaunt, wild, hungry-looking
fellow as to excite sympathetic companion-
ship in the kindly heart of his better-circum-
stanced fellow-prisoner.
“Ah,” he grunted as he blew out a cloud
of smoke. “ ’Tis mesilf is afther thankin’
y’r ’anner very kindly. Sure, thin, a great
blessin’ is th’ wade entoirely. ’Tis foinc
’baccy y’r ’anner is afther smokin’.”
“Take some,” said Hayes—-“take some to
do ye afterwards. ’Tis not a few pipefuls
o’ tobacco I’d be grudging a fellow-unfortu-
nate from me own country. But who are
ye, me man? Tell me that.”
The man squatted down on his haunches
before Sir Henry, and gazed at him som-
brely. He puffed silently at his stumpy pipe
for a few moments before he spoke. He
spat into the river and stared into the gently
up-flowing tide for a little while.
“Well, thin, y’r ’anner, ’tis not for me to
say who I am now. I scarce know mesilf.
But three year ago I was Rory O’Toole, of
Ballyminch, in th’ County o’ Cork —an’ not
an empty-gutted scarecrow, such as ye see
before ye. I’d twelve good acres o’ land me
father —rest his sowl—left to me whin he
died. I’d five cows wid calves an’ two
lilough-horses, an’ a dozen pigs, an’ cocks
an’ hins galore. An’ a wife an’ childher, an’
all a man might want. To-day all I’ve got
is an empty belly an’ a sore back an’ a sad
heart an’ a black curse for this God-forsaken
country an’ thim that rules over it. Glory
to God, ’tis a hard time for us Irish, y’r
’anner—Sir Hinry.”
“Ye know me. then, O’Toole?”
“Aye, that I do, y’r ’anner. I knew ye
well when ye was sheriff—an’ a foine bould
wan ye made, sorr, if I might say it. An’
I kem out in th’ ship wid ye, too. Wid that
black-hearted scoundrel Dick Brookes in the
Atlas—may she sink an’ perish!”
“And what can I do for ye, O'Toole? If
'tis in me power I’d gladly do ye a turn.”
The man rose up and looked about him
searchingly. Then he walked round a clump
of bushes that grew behind them, and came
back and gazed up at the higher bank and
into the branches of the slie-oak. He squatted
down again on his hams in front of Sir
Henry.
“Th’ trees have ears here, y’r ’anner.
I’ve that to say to ye ’twould hang me before
to-morrow morning, if ’twas to become known
to th’ Commandant, Captain Abbott.”
“Ye may say all ye want to, O’Toole—
there’s no one nigh to us. What is it ye
have to say?”
“Y’r ’anner was not wid us in ’ninety-
eight?”
“Good Ged, no, man! Wasn’t I High
Sheriff? Didn’t I have to hang dozens of
ye? Ye know that, Rory O’Toole, as well
as I do. You were a United Irishman, you
mean ?”
“ ’Tis that I was, sorr —an’ that I am
still, an’ so’s aich wan of us, up yander at
Castle Hill —savin’ on\y thim we can’t trust,
what’d sell their own brothers for a gill o’
rum. But we know ’em all, an’ are lureful
wid ’em. Sorr, there’s a great r~.,ve afoot,
an’ th’ boys have sint me for to see would
ye make wan of us. Gin’ral Joseph Holt —
he’ll have none of it. Though ’twas liimsilf
was th’ great wan at Vinegar Hill. He gives
us no hope of success, but we know bettlier
than that. There’s nigh two thousand of
us in th’ settlemifit—at Castle Hill an’ Toon-
gabbie, an’ here in Parramatta an’ down
below in Sydney. An’ we’re all druv’ mad
wid misery, y’r ’aiiner. What’s a few soul-
diers to min that have naught to lose an’
all to gain? First of all, we’d deal wid this
lot here an’ take their arruras, an’ thin we’d
dale wid thim in Sydney. An’ ’twould not
o’ny be th’ United Irish, sorr —most o’ th’
pris’ners would come in wid ns. ’Twould
be certain victory, y’r anner.”
In his eagerness and enthusiasm, the
gaunt prisoner did not mark the ominous
frown that had come into Sir Henry’s face
or the scowl with which the knight regarded
him. He went on.
“But we want a gintleman for to lead it's,
y’r ’anner —one o’ th’ qualify. We’ve no
wan in tli’ shtockade’s army bettlier than
th’ rist. We want someone we can take
ordhers from widout jealousy. So at a
sacret meetin’ held last night ’twas resolved
I should lay th’ matter before y’r ’aimer.
We know ye’ve suffered crool wrong an’
injustice—how ye’ve but just been doin’
months in Sydney Gaol for nothing at all
but th’ spite o’ thim’s in power. An’ we
know y’r ’anner’s bin an officer in the Cork
Militia. So I’ve come for to ask y’r ’aimer
will ye be our leader in th’ business. An’
I’m empowered for to say that whin we’ve
took th’ settlemint y’r ’anner will be elected
th’ fir’rst prisidint o’ th’ free an’ indepin-
dint United Shtates av Austhraly. There
now, y’r ’anner —what think ye o’ that, if I
might make bould to ask?”
Rory O’Toole was altogether unprepared
for the response of Sir Henry Brown Hayes
to this flattering invitation from liis coun-
tryman.
With a bellow of rage the knight sprang
to his feet, and, as the emaciated convict
rose also in astonishment, he rushed at him,
seized him about the middle with a pair of
powerful arms and heaved him into the river.
When the delegate from Castle Hill rose to
his feet in the shallow mud and water close
to the shore, he became aware of an infuri-
ated figure dancing upon the grassy bank
below the spreading branches of the she-
oak —a raging man who shook his fist
at him and shouted violent abuse.
“Ye bog-trotting blackguard, ye!”
yelled Sir Henry at the alarmed O’Toole.
“How dare ye come to me—to me who’s held
the commission of his Majesty, both as High
Sheriff and as an officer of the militia? How
dare ye suppose I’d lade y’r dirty mob of
guttersnipes? Good Ged!”
He searched about and picked up rounded
stones from amongst the sbe-oak’s roots, with
which he began to bombard the dripping and
ragged O’Toole.
“Glory be!” murmured that unfortunate
conspirator as he plunged into the stream
and began to swim across to the opposite
shore —“ ’tis a distressful man he is, en-
tirely. Did iver ye see th’ loike!”
“I’ll make it my business to tell the autho-
rities all I know of your infernal plot, you
blackguard!” Hayes called after the back of
O’Toole’s shaggy head as he pelted a final
stone at it. “The damned impudence—me,
an officer and a gentleman, to be approached
in this way!”
lie picked up his rod and his book, and
started up the bank to his hut, with haste
and energy.
“I’ll go straight into Parramatta,” he mut-
tered to himself, “and inform Captain Abbott
of what’s afoot.”
But when he reached the top of the bank
he found himself face to face with the .Com-
mandant of the settlement; at Parramatta
and tbo Adjutant of the N.S.W. Corps, Lieu-
tenant Mincliin. Captain Abbott looked
sternly at him.
"Sir Henry Brown Hayes,” he said coldly,
“permit me to remind you that I have special
instructions regarding yourself from his Ex-
cellency the Governor. I think I have done
so before. I warn you that if I find you
again holding communication with seditious
characters such as that man O’Toole, I shall
consider it my duty to replace you where
you will be incapable of brewing any mis-
chief. Good evening, Sir Henry Brown
Hayes. Come, Mincliin!”
Speechlessly the knight gazed after the
scarlet backs of the two officers as they
walked away in the direction of the town.
His face was purple, and his figure trembled
with righteous anger.
“My God!” he gasped. “Ye may find it
out for yourselves, ye damned popinjays!
Hell and ruin:—let ’em come to your precious
settlement! I’ll not raise a finger or say a
word to prevent it. Good Ged!”
J. H. M. ABBOTT.
The Little Track.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
f HERE is a little ferny track that goes.
I Fringed with the brier-rose,
Beside the dance of cloud-flung
shadows fleet
Across the whispering wheat,
Where lilting winds in lazy ripples play
The long November day.
There the gay blue wren from a bent spray
swings
In the green heart of things ;
There wings the pallid cuckoo, with a long
Haunting refrain of song,
In lessening echoes where the upland goes,
Calling the spring’s sweet close.
I know the starry-eyed clematis trails
Frail fairy wedding veils
Across the shady, narrow trail that leads
Where the tall cocksfoot seeds,
Where eldorados of the eapeweed’s gold
Are gleaming fold on fold.
There is a little creek that lowly drones
A love song to the stones,
Where shafted sunlight slants amid the boles
By rainbowed waterholes,
Flinging soft traceries of gold and green
The leafy aisles between.
Here have I sought a balm for heart’s dis-
tress
In the cool wilderness,
Here in the corridors of fern have found
Nothing but holy ground,
Remembering something less of pains and
losses
Deep amid fronds and mosses.
All things seem possible beneath this sky.
Though by and bye
The old forlorn, familiar host of cares
Will creep back unawares,
To-day they are forgotten or but seem
Some foolish far-off dream.
So down the little, wandering track again
1 break the bonds of pain
To find the comfort of the mothering wild,
Spent as a homesick child,
Where gathered to her sheltering arms alone
The old bush calls her own.

of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers, etc.
It is fitted with a 2f-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one attendant
for guiding purposes.
The running cost of an “ATCO,” thanks to the scientific precision of its
construction, is remarkably low. An operator can very easily and completely
cut 1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol
and oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.

HOLDS 50 £ MORE INK
Onoto, the Pen, has for years been the busy man’s pen. The
ease with which it fills and cleans itself, its readiness to write when-
ever wanted, its absolute security from leakage, and the fact that it
holds 50 per cent, more ink than any other self-filling pen, has
gained for Onoto, the Pen, the first place.
