THE men who designed this five-
valve Receiver Model 20 are the
same men who refined and per-
fected the Radio Valve, made practical
the Super-Heterodyne circuit, and
pioneered the uni-control and lighting-
socket-operated Receiver. They were
the first to dispense with aerials and to
do away with batteries. Everywhere the
Radio Corporation of America is., recog-
nised as the world's greatest Radio
organisation.
In their Model 20, RCA have succeeded
in perfecting a set 20 times as selective
as the average antenna set on the market.
They have perfected a set famous for
its ability to reproduce musical notes un-
distorted at full volume.
A 5-Valve Receiver
far in advance of any
previous
5-Valve Set.
WRITE FOR
BROCHURE,
“Bigger Value in Radio.”
RCA Model 20 gives practically 7-valve
performance though it uses only five.
For average home reception RCA
deceiver Model 20 is adjusted by real
one-dial control. Three tuning circuits
are adjusted simultaneously by one
control. For far-off stations there are
two minor controls for finer tuning, but
for ordinary purposes listening-in is
regulated by one dial. In its beautiful
two-tone Walnut Cabinet truly this
RCA Model 20 offers the greatest value
in Radio. Let us send you further in-
formation and the booklet “Bigger
Value in Radio” which describes Model
20 and other RCA Receivers.

The Red Page
The Last German Emperor
Kaiser Wilhelm 11., by Emil Ludwig
(Putnam: Angus and Robertson), dedicated
“to his subjects,” looks the most faithful
portrait of any Hohenzollern that ever came
out of Germany. It has been created from
official documents and some 20 volumes of
German memoirs. For the sake of
fairness the author decided that no adver-
sary of the ex-Emperor’s should be allowed
to bear against him. We may judge
him, therefore, by the woi’ds that came out
of his own mouth and by the statements of
his relations and friends, his Chancellors
and Ministers, his generals, courtiers and
officials.
We must allow a little sympathy to a
boy who has t.o start, life with an incurable
physical disability, especially if he is des-
tined to stand before his people, unabashed
and unruffled, the chief personage on all
occasions. This boy was born a Prussian
Prince and the tradition of his fathers de-
manded that he become a soldier, and show
himself spirited and intrepid. He was, there-
fore, corffronted with the task of over-
coining a natural sense of bodily inferiority
and the timidity almost inseparably con-
nected with malformation. He deserves
some credit for a moral victory in so far
as he conquered an infirmity for which he
was in no wise to blame. And Englishwoman
though she was, we shall find it very hard
to forgive his mother for an unnatural anti-
pathy to her deformed son. “How I admire
your handsome, intelligent and graceful
Crown Prince when I see him beside my
uncouth, lumpish son William!” she said
to an Austrian nobleman. Terrible words
for any mother to use, especially when
spoken to a foreigner; she should have
• known that the confidence would be repeated
in Vienna—and thence passed to every
Court in Europe. From his father, too, he
got little but harshness. “In view of the
immaturity of my eldest son, together with
his tendency towards overbearingness and
self-conceit, I cannot but frankly regard it
as dangerous to allow him at present to
take part in foreign affairs”—thus did the
Crown Prince, in 1886, seek to veto the
employment of his son in the Foreign Office,
which Bismarck had caused the old Emperor
to ordain.
After an adolescence fruitful in little but
stern experiences, the young man was sud-
denly called to power in 1888. In his oath
of accession he was required to swear only
to maintain his own authority—to decide
all questions vital to the country to the
best of his ability. As ( Emperor-King he
was sui generis, and who would dare point
out to the young Kaiser that all this was
the creation of a Junker, and that he owed
his position to the strength and devotion
of a courageous people? Least of all would
Bismarck, even though he saw seated on
the throne of the Kaisers a young man who
Believed himself to be God-appointed, The
inferiority complex soon asserted itself in
an ostentatious display of authority. To
make matters worse, he had little capacity
for protracted work of any sort. It was
seldom k that he followed a line of serious
thought to its logical conclusion. His most
conspicuous traits were vivacity, vanity,
arbitrariness, instability and extravagance;
and everything that, appears repugnant in
his behaviour seems capable of explanation
by the nervous self-assertion to which his
infirmity impelled him from his earliest
years. In his relations with England per-
sonal jealousies were the driving or counter-
acting forces, and he reviled and wooed
Britain alternately with imperishable hatred
and imperishable desire. The actual result
of visits to England during five years was
to offend his uncle, to offend Salisbury, and
to annoy society, the press, and the man
in the street.
To the Czar’s proposal for a peace con-
ference at The Hague in 1898 the Kaiser
answered: “Can we picture a monarch, a
supreme war-lord, disbanding his illustrious
historic regiments, consigning their glorious
flags to arsenals and museums, and thus
delivering his cities over as a prey to
anarchists and democrats?” Yet he started
his reign by trying to attract the workers.
He would set himself up as the father of
his: people. And during the tramway strikes
of 1900, when riots broke out in Berlin,
he wired to headquarters: “I trust that at
least 500 will be snuffed out before the
troops return to barracks.” In the same
year, despatching his marines to China to
take part in a punitive expedition after
the _ assassination of his ambassador at
Pekin he exhorted his troops:—
“You must know, my men, that .you are
to meet a crafty, well-armed, cruel foe. Meet
him and beat him. Give no quarter. Take
no prisoners. Kill him when he falls into
your hands. Even as a thousand years ago
tne Huns under their King Attila made
such a name for themselves as still resounds
in terror through legend and fable, so may
the name of German resound through
Chinese history a thousand years from now,
a*d may you so conduct yourselves that no
Chinaman will ever again as much as dare
to look crooked at a German.”
That speech was one of the great dis-
services the Kaiser did his country. It
fastened the name of “Hun” upon it.
But the Attila pose could not really
stand the test of war. It was a hard-shelled
Conservative, von Koller, who said to
Hohenloe soon after the Emperor’s acces-
sion: “God preserve us from war while
this Bmperor is-on the throned -He would
lose his nerve; he is a coward at heart!”
When the real test came, when before his
country and before history he was called
upon to justify his system of autocracy,
lie was found wanting. In their direst need
he deserted his subjects. He left them to
face privation while he drove off to ease
and comfort in a neutral country.
The author does not seek to throw any
new light on the question of war guilt, but
one is left with a deep impression that the
German people were very badly served by
their last Emperor.
GERALD DILLON.
The Abo, and the Theatre
A recent Red Page contributor, pleading
fbr the establishment of an Australian
National Theatre, which is an exceedingly
laudable object, seems to argue that because
Ireland has established one in the Abbey
Theatre,' the task should be easy in this
country. I was in the beginnings of the
Abbey Theatre and can show the essential
advantages Ireland had that Australia lacks.
The recorded history of Ireland starts
somewhere before King Canute and a long
time before the Battle of Hastings—one
must use English events for chronological
comparisons. In those days when the rest
of the world wa§ floundering in inter-tribal
warfare, with its Piets, and Scots, and Danes
and Angles, Ireland had an organised gov-
ernment under an Ard-Ri (High King) and
lesser kings. And in those days it had
also a literature and traditions, legends,
fairy tales, and a mythology for which the
world has no equal. Steeped in tradition,
wrapped in legend, and fanatically chival-
rous, is it any wonder that the Irish resented
the Anglo-Saxon invasions and especially
the Sassenach influx of the reign of. James
the First? And is it any wonder that some
of the invaders absorbed the traditions of
the country and its people which eventu-
ally found expression in the Irish Literary
Renaissance of the 1890’s, in connection
with which are to be found more English
and French names than real Irish—Sigerson,
Martin, Yeats, Rolleston, Gregory, Hyde,
Russell for example? I mention this as
showing that Australia would be making a
mistake were she to despise or reject liter-
ary and dramatic assistance from those who
may not happen to have been born in this
country.
The only really Irish names that come
to mind at the moment in connection with
the revival are Standish O’Grady and Moira.
O’Neill (Mrs. Shrine). “Fiona McLeod”
was a nom de plume for William Sharp.
What a fine old chap O’Grady was! His
typically Irish face carried on it the imprint
of everything that, was fine and worth while
in the history of Ireland, and as the real
prophet of the Renaissance his “Carmena
Gadelica” must stand as the first offspring
thereof, though “Finn and His Companions”
may be better known. Much credit must
also go to T. W. Rolleston, who, though
he actually wrote little about that time—
except the Rolleston-Espdsito “Deirdre
Cantata” and a few verses, such as “The
Dead at Clonmacnois”— was the real organ-
iser, largely directing the efforts of his
friends Yeats, Moore, Russell, Lady
Gregory, Edward Martin and the rest, not
forgetting John O’Leary, the Fenian, who
had done his seven years in Australia. It
was to Rolleston they went for advice and
help, especially as an organiser, and it was
“T.W.R.” who founded and was first, honor-
ary secretary of the London branch of the
Irish Literary Society, through which the
Renaissance found expression. And it was
Rolleston who really showed the way to
the Abbey Theatre, which first started as
the dramatic branch of the I.L.S.
As a boy at school in Dublin I played
the king’s spear-bearer and messenger in
the first play—“Maeve,” I think it was—
.produced by the society at the old Gaiety
in Dublin. There were difficulties in plenty,
mostly financial, and I remember that my
stage garment—of the Roman toga type—
could be embroidered on only one side for
this reason, and I and others had perforce
to keep that side to the audience. In that
week at the Gaiety three or four plays and
several curtain-raisers were produced, in-
cluding “The Bending of the Bough,” and
the Irish National Theatre was founded.
But what has all this to do with an
Australian National Theatre? Everything.
It was the old stories that made the Abbey
Theatre possible as a medium for the pro-
duction of modern Irish plays. Synge was
a product of the Abbey Theatre, not a
founder of it, and “The White-headed Boy”
and “The Playboy of the Western World”
would never have been written had there
not been a theatre in which to produce
them. The difference in Australia is that
there are no old legends of sufficient roman-
ticism, or if there are they are of the
aboriginal type, and if depicted true to
aboriginal life would be most unacceptable,
The native abo. would not make a pretty
picture on the stage, but his ancestors
might have done so— quien sabef— and a
little camouflage in a good cause would'

be forgivable. In abo. mythology there are
many tales and legends probably every bit
as beautiful as the old Irish stories. Glim-
merings of these appear in the pages of
The Bulletin. One of them condensed
into a paragraph lately impressed me very
strongly with its possibilities. It dealt with
the moon and stars and the sun, and with
sunset and sunrise, and linked them up in
a very ingenious way with the abo. race.
This is the sort of material that is required;
and if once the task were tackled as the
Irish Literary Revivalists tackled theirs,
something very worth while, leading eventu-
ally to an Australian National Theatre,
would undoubtedly emerge. There are in
Sydney and in Melbourne quite enough
writers and poets with brains and ability
to form an Australian Literary Society—
the I.L.S. really had its origin in the
Rhymers’ Club of only twelve members,
meeting fortnightly at the Cheshire Cheese
off Fleet-street—and if they chose they
could originate such a movement in just
the same way. But it will take years and
it must be founded on romanticism and
legend, as was the Abbey Theatre.
COLUMBA.
Trollope
According to the Nation and Athenaeum,
one of the most remarkable literary events
oi' recent years is the revival in the reputa-
tion of Anthony Trollope. But no matter
how remarkable the revival, will it be as
remarkable as the manner in which Trollope
went out of favor? From the death of
Thackeray until about 1870 he was easily
the most popular and the greatest of the
English novelists. He was read, reviewed,
discussed, praised. He was “all the rage.”
Then gradually he began to go out of favor.
He began to be forgotten. Soon his name
was rarely mentioned. From the ’eighties
to the twentieth century he was a literary
nonentity. In Michael Sadlier’s recently-
issued “Trollope: a Commentary” (easily
the best biography and critical estimate of
the man ye"t published) there is quoted a
review written by Henry James, aged 21,
of “The Belton Estate” which was typical
of the attitude then gaining ground. “It
is a stupid book,” wrote James, “essentially,
organically stupid. It is without a single
idea. It is utterly incompetent to the
primary function of a book of whatever
nature—namely, to suggest thought.” That
was the voice of the age which immediately
followed Trollope.
What caused this change in public esti-
mation? Trollope himself was a good deal
responsible. For one thing, he was foolish
enough to write his “Autobiography.” Herein
he talked too much, destroyed too many
dearly-cherished fallacies, and adopted such
a pose that people lost confidence in him,
which was the first step towards forgetting
him. For example, one of the irritating
poses he adopted was concerning inspira-
tion. Fielding, Smollett, Sterne, Dickens
and Thackeray all wrote as the spirit moved
them. Not so Trollope. He ridiculed the
idea of inspiration:—
“To me it would not be more absurd if
the shoemaker were to wait for inspiration
or the tallow chandler for the divine moment
of melting. If the man whose business it is
to write has eaten too many good things or
has drunk too much or has smoked too many
cigars—as men who write will sometimes do
—then his condition may be unfavorable for
work, but it will be the condition of the
shoemaker who has been similarly imprudent.
I have sometimes thought that the inspira-
tion wanted has been the remedy which
time will give to the evil results of such
imprudence. The author wants thought, as
does every other workman —that and a habit
of industry. I was once told that the surest
aid to writing was a piece of cobbler’s wax
on my chair. I certainly believe much more
in the cobbler’s wax than in the inspiration.”
Very plausible, of course, but it is not true
and Trollope knew it. It was just one of
his little poses. Another was concerning
his object in writing:—
“I confess that my first object in taking
literature as a profession was that which is
common to the barrister when lie goes to
the Bar and to the baker when he sets up
his oven. I wished to make an income on
which I and those belonging to me might
live.”
Perhaps he did; but was it wise to talk
so much about it? Trollope was always
telling the public that he wrote for money,
and not for fame. The public likes to think
of a literary man as stirred by inspiration
and lofty Meals. It likes to think of
Dickens getting out of bed to stroll medi-
tatively about London’s streets and
of the printer waiting in the pas-
sage for the last sentences of “Tom
Jones.” It hates to think of literature as
a money-making business. Was it any
wonder that the public lost a good deal of
confidence in Trollope? It began to doubt
whether he was a genius, after all. He made
£63,000 from his books and £7OOO from his
journalistic work. He did not forget to
tell everyone about it. “Comfortable, but
not splendid,” was his comment. More
posing!
He broke too many rules of the game.
Take his practice of continually reminding
the reader that the story he was telling
was, after all, only make-believe. He fre-
quently referred to the work in hand as a
novel and to himself as a novelist. In
“Barchester Towers” he described how Mr.
Arabin wooed Eleanor Bold, and suggested
that the lady might have acted in a much
more direct and natural way, but if she
did “where would have been my novel?”
If there is one fundamental requirement in
the art of fiction, surely it is that the
illusion of reality shall be preserved. This
is so recognised nowadays that no serious
novelist would dream of slapping credulity
in the face. The same thing is to some
extent indicated by the names he gave
his characters: Dr. Pessimist Anticant, Mr.
Sentiment, Mr. Neversaydie, Mr. Stickatit,
Mr. Rerechild, and Mr. Quiverful (a poor
clergyman with 14 children) —all these
people are too difficult to believe in. Their
names destroy the illusion. And indeed
they have no depth. They have none of
the complexity and subtlety of living
people. They are like figures on a film.
Yet he had a really fine and admirable
quality—ability to give a wonderful photo-
graphic picture of the life that he knew.
Bit by bit, with innumerable details and
illustrations, he built up a picture that one
recognised as photographically accurate. He
did not see things satirically like Fielding,
grotesquely like Dickens, or cynically like
Thackeray, but calmly, impartially and
stolidly. He never attempted to explain
why people in a certain situation conducted
themselves in a certain way. He told you
they were in that situation, and invariably
in doing so he unconsciously gave you the
atmosphere and feeling of the affair. For
that reason he was more of a painter than
a storyteller. In his slow, heavy way he
built up a picture of ordmary people in
an ordinary world, and although you felt
that the picture was marvellously true (like
a photograph) you did not feel that it
was particularly beautiful, artistic or dis-
tinctive. It had none of those artistic
depths of light and shade that give vitality
to a good painting.
Why then should there be a revival of
interest in the novels of such a writer?
Who knows? Certainly not I. Yet Ido know
that I shall follow the fashion and read
once again “The Warden,” “Framley Par-
sonage,” and the rest.
MAURICE GEORGE.
Hypocrisy in Theatre-going
Your theatrical entrepreneur would have
a pretty thin time of it if he had to depend
on the genuine play-lover. Indeed, if the
snobbery connected with theatregoing was
wiped out altogether, the theatres would
all be shut up in a week. The managers
know this, and work the social side for
all it is worth. Phrases like “The big social
and theatrical event of the year,” “A grand
gala opening night,” “Before a brilliant and
representative audience” are dotted about
the advertisements, and there is also an
arrangement with certain dailies to publish
the names of well-known people in the
house. There is certainly a thrill connected
with a first night that one cannot capture
on other nights, and it is nice to be in
early with the verdict; but it isn’t that
which fills rows A—H of the reserved stalls
on those occasions. It is the knowledge
that it will be the best occasion on which
to be “seen” and perhaps even “mentioned."
So the etceteras are carefully carried out —
the last-minute arrival, the shrill conver-
sation which effectively drowns the last bars
of the overture, the toying with - a box of
chocolates and the glare at someone else
who has contrived to arrive even a few
moments later. Indeed, many women think
it is quite a slight to them if you do not
get your seats for an opening or big Satur-
day night, and will tell you that they “are
not particularly anxious to see that piece,
thank you.”
That is why, if it is a play that needs to
be taken seriously, or that contains good
acting, the front stalls are almost unen-
durable to the enthusiast. Taken en masse,
they contain the least intelligent section of
the house; there the patrons’ eyes rove
round to see what the other women are
wearing; there is too much “refinement” to
allow them to think of clapping, or showing
any approval at the finest acting—unless it
happens to be one of their idols, a “Gladdie”
Moncrieff or a “Maudie” Fane; and a con-
tinual barrage of disparaging comment
maddens you if the leading lady does not
happen to be playing a well-dressed role.
The only part of the theatre, horribile
dictu, in which you will find whole rows of
real enthusiasts, and hear intelligent com-
ment and genuine approval on each side
of you, is the gallery. For who would put
up with the inconvenience of arriving at
the theatre a couple of hours before the
commencement, and the discomfort of stand-
ing for a long time in a queue, but the
enthusiast really anxious to see the show?
But because in its lofty heights there also
congregate the giggling factory-girls we still
have to look on the gallery as the gallery.
A proof of the extent to which snobbery
and the desire to be seen has influenced
theatregoing is the way in which the
reserved stalls have gradually usurped the
place of the dress-circle as the fashion-
able part of the theatre, the rendezvous of
the creme de la creme. A few years ago,
the dress-circle, as its very name implies,
was always the part of the theatre; and no
one can deny that it is by far the most
pleasant place from which to see the show,
especially if it is a pantomime or spec-
tacular piece, and also the best place from
which to hear the music. The critics are
to be found in the d.-c., and a producer or
manager who is watching a show invariably
selects it; also the theatre foyer is always
built at the d.-c. entrance. But in Australia
to-day the circles are taken only after the
stalls are filled, and the deadheads are
accommodated there, and the thing to do
is to scramble for the aforesaid rows A—H
of the stalls and get a headache through
craning your neck upwards at the stage. The
only exception, strange to say, is in the
oldest theatre in the Commonwealth, the
Royal at Hobart, where it is a terrible
faux pas to go anywhere but the
and where patrons lean back in tlfeir red
velvet seats to gaze down severely on
the plebs in the wooden reserved stalls. As
further proof, at picture shows, where the
auditorium is in the dark most of the time,
and people “blow” in at any old hour, the
dress-circle is the ■ most esteemed and
highest-priced section.
Besides the snob who rushes to tj\e opera
or the Russian ballet without tl|e least
idea of what it is about, there is the snob
who would hate to be missed any
boring repertory show, and never* misses
anything by any author with a foreign-
sounding name, or anything abouf. which
the word has been passed round that it is
an “intellectual feast.” Between these and
all the others it would be interesting to
know for just how many of the thousands
who nightly fill our playhouses “thp play’s
the thing.”
CHARLES DEARDEN.
A Sdatchel of Books
The Planter’s Wife, by Marion Osmond
(Fisher Unwin). A story of Europeanised
Malaya in which plot is subordinated to a
picture of white society in that environment.
JAghting Seven Candles, by Cyntlpa Lom-
bardi (Appleton). The sleeping beauty of
an Italian story is deftly interwoven with
the tragedy in a young American’s life, and
provides material for a tale of mystery and
imagination.
By the City of the Long Sand, by Alice
Tisdale Hobart (Fisher Unwin). A book
to which the present happenings in China
give a special interest, since it is a Record of
facts gathered from personal experience dur-
ing 12 years on America’s trade frontier in
that country.
History of Scotch College, Melbourne. The
college history committee, representative of
the masters and the Old Boys, has produced
tliis very complete record of the school’s
annals over the 75 years of its existence. It
is thoroughly comprehensive, richly illustrated
in color and line and handsome in format.
The Secret Adversary, by Agatha Christie
(John Lane). The author, who not so long
ago was herself the subject of a mystery
that provided much newspaper copy, sus-
tains her reputation as a skilful weaver of
puzzle plots. The story is well constructed
and supplies a new definition of marriage—
“a damned fine sport.”
Singers’ French, by May Laird-Brown
(Dent). There is French as spoken in
France, French “as she is spoke” by John
Bull, and now we have singers’ French. The
last, we are assured, differs in many details
from the spoken speech, the French native
having an inherited appreciation of the
subtle beauties of his language. The book
is subdivided into lessons, and has a sup-
plementary section dealing with grammar
and construction. If lie cannot order a chop
in Parisian French, the diligent apprentice
may be able to sing his needs.
In Northcliffe’s Service, by Fred L.
Lowther (Angus and Robertson). The author
was Lord Northcliffe’s confidential agent dur-
ing 1914-22, the neriod in which the North-
cliffe press had its greatest influence. Low-
ther’s original intention was to entitle his
work “Why Britain Is Poverty Stricken,"
but in view of nossible offence lie abandoned
it, though it well suggests the theme of a
frankly outspoken book, pungent but ill-
balanced.
The Letters of George Eliot , selected by
R. Brimley Johnson. The life of Mary Ann
Evans covers a period when the Non-Confor-
mist conscience was securing its legal as well
as its doctrinal liberty. That her life did
not in all respects conform to conventional
standards does not lessen, nor did it so in
her lifetime, the serious intent of her novels.
She lived when “the novel with a purpose"
met the requirements of a sober-minded
middle-class. In the present age, with its
revolt against the standards of its fathers,
such a novel as “Adam Bede” —in its day
a best-seller —would find but a limited circle
of readers. But the name of George Eliot still
lives as that of a great literary force in the
Victorian age, and many whose years carry
them back to the days when youth was fed
on her literary pabulum will welcome the
collection of letters in this volume.
The Autobiography of Kingsley Fairbridge
(Oxford University Press). Fairbridge was
a Rhodes scholar who from the quite early
days of a comparatively short life was
possessed by the vision of a great imperial
work —the emigration of children from the
crowded cities of Britain, where they were
doomed to “a blind-alley existence and the
squalor of the slums,” to a land of space and
opportunity. His plan was simple in itself,
but fraught with difficulties in execution.
In 1912, at the close of his Oxford course,
with the support of his newly-formed Child
Emigration Society. Fairbridee and his wife
set out for Westralia to prepare a home for
the first batch of young settlers. This was
the beginning of the Pinjarra settlement.
Co-operation with the Barnardo emigration
authorities strengthened the original move-
ment till to-day there are 207 children at the
school, and 40 substantial buildings erected
at a cost of over £23.000. The autobiography
is the worthy book of a very worthy man.
The Miserable Clerk, by Steele Rudd
(Pratten Bros.). The author of “On Our
Selection” has deserted his familiar fields
for the life of the city. The clerk in this
collection of disconnected incidents occupies
a high stool in the office of the sheriff of
Queensland, and it is about the business of
this high functionary that Steele Rudd's
pen now moves. The experiences give the
reader a look into a side of official life that
has not been explored, and is full of human
interest, the subjects ranging from the adven-
tures of an absconding debtor to the execu-
tion of a criminal.

A Little Path.
A little path that winding went
Where nights and noons and golden days
Were shrouded in a twilight haze,
And purple nebuli had lent
Their softness to a mossy maze.
little path that loitered long
W here Soring had halted on her way
To give the flowers holiday,
And still her lilting, running song
Hung on the hemline- bursting spray.
A little path that basking lay
Across a sweeping slope of green,
And never straying cloud had been
Across the sky on any day
To drift the path and sun between.
A little path that singing led
W here Autumn woke his forge’s ire,
And, with strong arms that might not tire,
Beat out the copper burning red
To splash the leaves with splendid fire.
A little path that weeping wound
Along the throbbing river sands
Among the trailing willow wands,
By sobbing water grasses bound,
Across a wind-swept, moaning land.
A little path of yesterday
Where many winters’ leaves have lain
And felt the softly-falling rain;
So, where our feet were wont to stray,
Dear buried seasons still remain.

The Young Moon.
Swing low, young moon.
Shine through the silver meshes of the
trees,
That hear the soft slow croon
Of drowsy winds, as soothing as the sea’s
That drifted once within the shelly cave
That hid Endymion—
The muted voices of the wind and wave.
How bright you shone
When, leaning low, you stooped above, and
kist '
His warm young loving lips,
About him folded glamorous veils of mist,
And touched him with your rosy finger
tips.
So weave the magic spell of loveliness
About me even now;
Bestow like joy and rapture; gently press
Cool lips against my brow,
Untii I dream we tread the starry skies,
Until in ecstasy my senses swoon.
Sweet goddess, bend and bless me with youi
eyes.
Lean low, young moon.

ETHEL MARTYR.
Tilling Time.
The sun is on the russet mould,
The teams of tillage tread the loam
On furrows running fold on fold
Down slopes that sweep from Blaynev’s
home.
Br . i S 1 I lt windows glimmer through the trees
YY Inch seem to plume the homestead roofs.
Clear autumn-morning voices sweet
filing lilting strains of joy complete
On winds that swirl the dust of hoofs.
Seeking the wisdom of the soil
That broke in season to his plough
Success, the fruit of thoughtful toil
Bestows its gift on Blayney now'.
Fean years and fickle seasons past
His stout and patient heart defied,
.through flood and drought and bush-fire
blast,
Though other hearts gave in at last
He labored with unyielding pride.
Clean seed-beds from the homestead sweep
lo wooded height and skyline bare •
On fallowed flats contented sheep
Trail in the tracks of tine and share.
Wide harrows sweep a hillock’s crown
Close-cutting discs arouse the clay ’
On uplands robed in purple-brown,
W eaving the slopes a ruddy gown,
Combing the headland billows grey.
Bird-melody acclaims the sun
That lays his lustre on the pines
While starlings flock and peewits run
In ranks behind the sifting tines
Which tremble through the mellowed earth
Creaking a measureless refrain,
Stirring the bed for precious birth
Of bountiful October mirth
And streams of ripe November grain.
Shoulder to shoulder, eight abreast.
Staunch horses face the task before,
Marching the paddocks east and west;
Or yoked in tandem, four and four.
Northward and southward far they plod,
Holding the swingle bars with ease
Across the swells of stubborn sod,
Or under boughs which bend and nod
They brush around the boles of trees.
Beluctant is the sun to fall:
Low-hung above a timbered crest
He sheds his gold on roof and wall,
On leaf and branch his glances rest
With fond reflections beaming low,
Flecking the purple shades with chrome.
In mists of amber dust aglow
Above the headlands mounting slow
The tilling teams are wheeling home.

The little river racing goes.
With noisy song
Of joys it knows,
It winds by shingled banks along.
An arrant boaster from the hills,
Into the sea
Its freight it spills,
A gift lost in immensity!
The monster ocean scarcely seems
To heed the gift—yet who can say?
It maybe dreams

Of treasures sung by little streams—
Of shady bends where wild things hide
And beauties throng
On every side;

Over the Way.
Over the way they are dancing and singing.
Filling the night with a rhythmical sound,
Up and down gliding, and to and fro swing-
ing,
While the swift moments go merrily round.
Seen through red roses, rich roses climbing
Over a balcony lit with pink light,
Folk all a-merry their paces are timing,
Moving to music, entrancing and bright.
Chaining the gaze of by-passing beholders,
Passing beholders that halt in the street,
To and fro sway with round arms and white
shoulders
Girls young and radiant, girls tall and
sweet.
Glimpsed through the rose-vine are blue eyes
and merry,
Seen for a moment are bosoms of snow—
Lips with the red of the rose or the cherry.
Mouths with the curve and the grace of the
- * bow.
Folk all a-merry with music and laughter,
Under yon rose-lamps they circle and
swing,
Heedless of care that may track them down
after,
Heedless of all that the future may bring.
Lovely the night is, with flowers perfume-
laden,
Perfume and music that wander and stray.
Lovely is life to each stripling and maiden
Dancing and frolicking over the way.

Old-fashioned Roses.
I gathered these to fill her quiet room,
Old-fashioned roses loved of other years,
When sight of lilac spray or damask bloom
Brought England near, and dried a pil-
grim’s tears.
In early days my Grandsire bore with care
From his fair home in Kent a little tree;
And Granny wore the roses red and rare
He coaxed amid the gums to blossom free.
Both died in rosetime, and a thousand blooms
With watching faces peered to see them
pass ;
Aflame in rosetime seem their ancient tombs,
When crimson petals fall and fire the
grass.
Sweet flowers entwined with memories most
dear,
The flowers my Mother loved to see ablow;
J brought in these to deck her simple bier.
These friendly roses, wet with weeping so.

Pierrette.
“Where have you been, Pierrette?”.
“Questing for gold at the rainbow’s foot.
I caught my hair in a twisted root;
That’s why my eyes are wet.”
“What did you see, Pierrette?”
“I saw the man who lives in the moou
Hushing the earth with a quaint old rune
That haunts me even yet.”
“What else, what else, Pierrette?”
“I counted the flocks of silly sheep
Whose tally on wakeful nights I keep—
So many, I forget.”
“Why are you pale, Pierrette?”
“I met the ghost of a lover dead,
And he begged me to share his narrow
bed
Down in the grasses wet.”
“And did you go, Pierrette?”
“A thousand times I answered No,
But his wild weeping hurt me so,
I can do naught but fret.”
“Do you love him, Pierrette?”
“Oh, better than my life, my dear;
But very far away from here
Our trysting-place is set.”
“Why do you sob, Pierrette?”
“I dread the darkness and the cold
That leads me to Death’s quiet fold
And love’s bright coronet.”
“Why are you dumb, Pierrette?’"'
Alas ! she could not answer why ;
She lay like some poor butterfly
Crushed in her lover’s net.

THURSDAY, APRIL 21, 1927.
HELPING THE MAN ON THE LAND.
The desire to do some good for the
“primary producer”—in other words, the man
who makes his crust with the plough, spade,
etc., after that secondary producer, the
agricultural-implement maker, has supplied
these necessaries—is characteristic of all
Ministries. Sometimes they raise his
freights; sometimes they neglect his roads
till they are impassable; and most times
they are quite willing to refuse him access
to a good handy port, and make him pay
for 50 or 300 miles of needless haulage to
and from some other harbor. Occasionally
it is a matter of refusing simple legal protec-
tion. On a recent day The Bulletin collected
three diverse examples of the helpful spirit,
to go on with. The first came from Queens-
land. One of the money-raising and hair-
raising devices of a stone-broke Govern-
ment there is the water-tax. A particularly
loud shout on this topic was raised by a
farmer near Rockhampton, who stated that
he had bought a farm which included a
large waterhole, and had put a pumping-
engine on the latter. Then the State,
struggling desperately for money with which
to placate railway employees and others,
charged him several pounds per annum rent
for his own hole. Provided there are
sufficient holes in the country the revenue
should be considerable.
About the same time the N.S.W. Govern-
ment did its typical little bit by passing
the Inverell-Ashford Railway Bill. For over
20 years there has been an agitation for
an extension of the Sydney-Moree-Inverell
dead-end line through Glen Innes to some
Northern port, probably the Clarence.
(Harbor-Engineer Coode gave instructions
for making the Clarence, on which Grafton
stands, a really fine port, and though
meddling wiseacres muddled the plans it is
a pretty good port to-day, and there are
possibilities.) The railway would put a rich
district within 155 miles of a sea outlet
instead of 509 miles as at present. It would
furnish an alternative route to Sydney 34
miles shorter than the existing one. In the
course of 155 miles it would link together
the North-Western line, 490 miles long; the
Northern one, 492 miles long; and the North
Coast line, 579 miles long. As the present
way of connecting is to come hundreds of
miles south on one railway and then to
start north again on a parallel railway, it
is plain that the cross-country connection
would have great value for many people,
and especially the man on the land. By
reason of the villainous and loony policy
of hindering and retarding everything which
doesn’t point Sydney ward, the joining up of
the three great lines is blocked with a
malignity which is marvellous; but by
pretence of doing something the Invereil
dead-end is to have about 40 miles tacked
on to it in a northerly direction, thus
creating a new dead-end at Ashford, close
to the Queensland border.
* * * *
A third case of the craving to lend first
aid to the agriculturist was also a N.S.W.
specimen. It was a matter of passive rather
than active benevolence:—
Indignation lias been aroused through the
practices of land-agents operating in this
district (Albury). They have mostly con-
centrated attention on farmers, one of whom
has complained that on the representations
of these men he purchased what were
described as desirable residential sites near
Sydney at £l6O a block. It was subsequently
found that the Valuer-General’s estimate of
the value of the blocks was £l5 each.
After one man had paid £2OO lie placed
the matter in the hands of a solicitor, offer-
ing to surrender his interest in the blocks
if he was relieved of further payment; but
he was told that such a course was npt in
accordance with their business principles,
and would interfere with their selling cam-
paign.
In order to meet his obligations to the
vendors the farmer was compelled to mort-
gage his farm.
The same heartless performance has been
worked on thousands of unfortunates during
a number of years. At one time the ruffi-
ans in the trade allowed the victim to
escape with the loss of the bit of rock he
had bought and everything he had paid on
it. But it was discovered that the law, in
N.S.W., at all events, enabled the vendor, or
swindler, or what not, to sell up the home or
farm or business of his prey, and pursue him
through the Bankruptcy Court in search of
the last farthing he had promised to pay
for the rock. If the barbarism of imprison-
ment for debt still prevailed, he would
doubtless be pursued to the gaol door also.
Then N.S.W. might have counterparts of
Dickens’s Father of the Marshalsea, doing
life sentences for inability to pay some
shark for a patch of sand. There are
many things which might be done to
protect the farmer from this shark. A
court might be established with power to
review instalment land transactions. The
travelling liar might be prosecuted for not
having a hawker’s license, and the Trades
Hall might be authorised to deal with him
as a “scab” who stood outside the Hawkers’
Union. It might be enacted that door-to-
door sharking in the allotment business is
not a lawful visible means of support, and
then the practitioner would become a com-
mon vagrant. The lack of any effort to
suppress his notorious soul suggests that
itinerant estate-agency of the bush and sub-
urban sort has a “pull,” in common with
bookmaking.
* * * *
A volume might be written about govern-
mental efforts to do things for the man on
the land. And then another volume might
be written on the energy with which a vast
multitude of other things that need doing
are not done.
AMUSING RAILWAYS IN QUEENS-
LAND.
It is assumed that a definite crisis of some
sort will develop in the Queensland rail-
ways, but it is difficult to picture what
form it will take. There is lack of pre-
cedent to go upon. The situation presents
the features which are to be found in other
States, but they are mostly aggravated—
some of them grotesquely aggravated. There
is, first of all, a system which is nomi-
nally owned by the State, but which really
belongs to Private Enterprise creditors, all
of the cumulative preference variety, so
that the whole dividend must be paid
whether the days be wet or dry. Further,
it must be paid on lost capital and other
capital. A company may write off its own
capital when it is lost, and cases may be
quoted of 95 per cent, being thus written off.
But an indebted State can’t write off other
people’s capital except by national bank-
ruptcy, and paying off losses has never been
attempted in Australia. The State nomi-
nally manages the system, but that is
really done by the unions, so the Govern-
ment is only a bone of contention between
two millstones. The lines, which were the
best-paying in Australia, are now hopelessly
unprofitable, and there is too much mile-
age for the needs of the population. Still
the Ministry is under strict orders to build
more mileage, in order to furnish employ-
ment, and tbe result is that there is a
record amount of line authorised, or under
construction or under suspended con-
struction, work having stopped for want
of funds. In addition, there is some line
that is shut up and abandoned.
It is now reckoned that the flood damage
was much over-estimated, and will amount
to only £lOO,OOO. Still, taking one thing
with another, the drought included,
£2,000,000 is mentioned as the probable rail-
• way deficit for this year. That will be worse
than last year’s figure, and, in fact, will be
the worst on record. The Banana province’s
official railway report enumerates 88 sec-
tions. For the 12 months to June, 1926, the
number which paid working expenses and
interest was nine. Nineteen paid working ex-
penses and only part of the interest, some
of the shortages being £52,777, £55,673,
£57,446, £68,275, £68,275, £70,429 and £74,148.
Sixty paid no interest at all, and failed to
produce full working expenses. The Commis-
sioner blames the increase of the deficit
from £894,498 in 1924-25 to £1,792,754 in
1925-26 partly on the seasons and partly on
the 44-hour week, which called for many
extra employees and much extra overtime
pay: it is a common saying that the ambi-
tion of the Queensland railway unionist is
to work 56 hours per week, 16 hours being
overtime. Trains are alleged to run hours
late so that the crews may pile up
overtime. Wages appear moderate, but per-
quisites are immoderate. The tale goes
round of Bill, at some microscopic station
with two mixed trains per day. whose earn-
ings are £ll per week, mostly overtime pay.
Officers are remarkably numerous as com-
pared with men, but this doesn’t lead to
oppression. The men tell the officers to go
to Hell, and the officers don’t go, and thus
a happy medium is arrived at. The public
service up north is really a benevolent
institution for the benefit of Government
supporters, and remarkable things are done
in the way of finding room for Government
supporters. For instance, Babinda is
described in “Pugh’s” as a “small township
on Weinert’s Creek, in a district mainly
devoted to sugar-growing, distant 36 miles
from Cairns by train.” There is a small
State pub with £1873 worth of stock (this
year’s figures) at this small township, and
the State’s own statistics declare that 33
people are employed at that little pub.
Still, in the absence of comoetition, it pays.
& & 5 &
Queensland is not a land of especially
cheap travel. The 101 miles run from Bris-
bane to Toowoomba costs 20s. Id. first-
class and 13s. second. The 104 miles from
Sydney to Newcastle is priced at 13s. lid.
and 9s. 9d. The one mile from Mount
Morgan to the next station is charged at
6d. and the one mile from Rockhampton
to the next station at sd. The rolling stock
is unlovely, though there are rare excep-
tions. For instance, something good can
be said about the once-a-week train which
takes the tourist out to Charleville to climb
upon the aeroplane for the Far North. But
the general impression is of dust and decay.
Motor competition troubles the Queensland
railways as it does others, but it is coun-
tered to some extent by leaving occasional
stretches of road in a condition that is
almost fatal to traffic. A recent story is
that a squadron of seven motor-lorries left
Toowoomba for Brisbane, starting in an
apprehensive way lest the decaying highway
should close for the season while they were
en route. By reason of the leading motor
getting bogged, and the others hitching on
one by one as a rescue party, and the track
collapsing under them so that they were
bogged also, an effective entrenchment was
put up, and the arrival of more vehicles
from east and west, which tried to circum-
vent the barricade, made chaos complete.
Some drivers bought a passage through
adjacent paddocks at varying prices, in sonic
cases 10s. per vehicle. A resident of
Childers, a town of 3000 population situated
40 miles from Maryborough, told The
Bulletin his more or less veracious tale.
Its tenor was that roads now practically
come to a finish five miles from the town,
and that the only train is the “mixed”
which does the trip in something over three
hours. Taking everything into account,
Queensland is a place of uncertainty, where
railway travel still exists but looks pre-
carious. Still there is only one line on
which it costs a shade over £541 to earn
each £lOO, and there are only ten lines on
which it costs much over £3OO to earn each
£lOO. A large section of the population
is insistent that the Commonwealth should
build, or largely help to build, a great south-
to-north railway through their territory; but
the investment would be dangerous in a
land with such habits and traditions.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Chaos in China.
From China there are reports of a concen-
tration of Soviet brigands on the Man-
churian border and a general mobilisation
in Japan, whose military authorities are
chartering troopships. Meantime, the
Nationalists, who started out with the
avowed intention of uniting China, have
forgotten their purpose in pursuit of
British subjects. The position is thus much
the same as in the Boxer business, when
a mob upheaval against the Manchus had
its energies turned against the foreigner,
moving him to intervention and giving
Russia the excuse for seizing Chinese terri-
tory.
The possibilities of a general subdivision
are nearly as bright to-day. France has a
strong base in Cochin-China and a railway
mto Yunnan, which would enable her to
carve out the rich province of Szechuan.
Japan is handy to Shantung, with its iron
and coal. Russia has already added Mon-
golia to the Soviet system, and the fore-
runners of a further advance are already in
existence in the neighboring provinces in
the shape of peasants’ and workmen’s
councils, which have taken over the manage-
ment of several cities and deprived the
Celestial owners simultaneously of their
capital and their heads.
Britain, although she has come in for
all the abuse, is the only Power whose
present attitude is morally unassailable.
Despite the fact that she has the largest
foreign army in China—the said army has,
incidentally, been thanked by 3000 foreigners
of all nationalities for saving their lives
and property in Shanghai—she was the only
Power to make a definite and generous con-
cession to the Nationalist aspirations. She
confirmed without any conditions whatever
the illegal seizure of her property at Han-
kow. She told the Cantonese in effect that,
as they claimed to be competent to look
after foreigners according to the usages
of decent society, she was willing to take
the risk and allow them to try. Up to
date, according to first-hand accounts, their
chief achievement has been to turn English-
women’s drawing-rooms into latrines. If
Father Bull gets impatient and abandons
his purely defensive role for a more
vigorous protection of his rights and in-
terests nobody but the Nationalists them-
selves will be to blame.
«.
The Rump Parliament of Labor.
Years ago, when the good men hadn’t got
back from the war and the bad men en-
joyed in consequence a better chance to run
the Labor show, it was resolved at a sort of
conference that the Commonwealth should
have compulsory military training, each
man retaining his gun after service was over
so that he might be armed with Government
property ready for the revolution. The
project failed, and the failure was possibly
regretted by many of the bogus-conference
men who met in Sydney at the sodden
Easter time. They seemed to be ripe for
upheaval, but short of the wherewithal to
heave.
The gathering was convened by Seals,
former president of the A.L.P., who had
failed to secure re-election, but insisted on
re-electing himself. The Red or Revolu-
tionary element collected, whether they were
appointed or appointed themselves. Premier
Lang arrived and discoursed unwisely, and
thus cast in his lot with the Rump, though
he may cast it in with the other party as
well. Having disposed of preliminaries the
inflammatory little conference stepped out
with seven-league boots. The genuine or
majority .officials being in possession of the
office premises, the keys, the books and
the cash, the bogus or minority party
ordered them to hand over these emblems
of authority. It debarred, so far as its writ
would run, 22 prominent Laborites from
holding any office within the party for three
years, by reason of “treacherous and uncon-
stitutional action” contrary to various rules
numbered from 21 to 68. Next it expelled
three politicians— Loughlin, Goodin and
Gillies —from the “movement,” thereby
making their seats vacant —unless, of course,
they refuse to vacate their seats and con-
sign the Rump to perdition. Premier Lang
was authorised to eject four Ministers and
reconstruct the Cabinet, and was also con-
firmed in his own billet. It might have lent
a finish to the idea if he had been authorised
to eject the Opposition and the Governor
and swim across to Maoriland.
The serious danger is that a caucus
majority, tired of squalid rows and untidy
practices, may prefer instead to reduce
Lang to the ranks; the genuine majority
conference may suspend, expel, excommuni-
cate or declare “black” everybody connected
with the wet Good Friday intrigue: and
the Governor may refuse to grant the disso-
lution ordered by the Rump, ask for
Lang’s resignation, and send for Bavin.
*
Confusion Worse Confounded.
The general election in Victoria has re-
sulted in no party getting a majority. This
is nothing new; the same thing happen?
at the elections of 1924, 1921 and 1920. In
fact, it is getting on for ten years since the
State had a Government with a pa ,r >
majority. It acquired the Bowser Ministn.
which was “Nationalist” or “Liberal oi
something, after the 1917 business, but t v
Bowsers lasted only 112 days. Then Lav-
son’s “Nationalists” came in and eontrne
to hang on for nearly five years, throwing
up the sponge at last after fighting two
unsuccessful elections in eight months (11
object was to get rid of the Country P al L
which held the balance of power) ana i -
constructing twice. The third Peaco
Ministry, which followed Lawson s, tin
up its toes in 81 days. Prendergasts a
Government did a bit better—it stave
the inevitable for 123 days. The bo .
Nash Administration, led by Allan


Peacock, arrived on November 18, 1924.
Its principal achievements were loans, defi-
cits, new taxation measures (some of which
crashed), and a redistribution of electorates
which infuriated the Labor party and the
Age, and not them alone. Its outstanding
characteristic was obstinacy in clinging to
office regardless of defeats.
Partly because of the redistribution and
partly because of a feeling that the Gov-
ernment was hopeless, several Ministerialists
revolted in the last session, and dissatisfied
Nationalists started what they called a
Liberal party, while dissatisfied Cockies
formed a Country-Progressive group. Then
was also seen the diverting spectacle of
Allan, Lawson and one Pickering deliver-
ing policy speeches on behalf of Govern-
ment, Nationalists and Cockies respectively;
of Nationalists and Cockies scrambling for
the same seats; of ex-Premier Watt, re-
cruited as a Nationalist speaker, giving the
Government, and especially the Nationalist
Ministers, beans ; of the said Ministers rue-
fully replying that they knew the Govern-
ment was dashed bad, but the Cocky
element was to blame; and of Allan
proudly declaring that his party of eleven
had the Premiership and half the portfolios,
and meant to keep them somehow, though
the alliance with the Nationalists had ex-
pired. The Government which cut so ridicu-
lous a figure was, of course, defeated; but
the Labor partv. considering all the advan-
tages it enjoyed, did not poll particularly
well. It won 28 seats, the same as in
the last Parliament, and in spite of its
shouts of “gerrymandering” it is doubtful
whether any scheme of redistribution would
have given it more. An analysis of the
votes by the friendly Age gave Labor only
333,021 out of 752,240. When Mr. Hogan
contemplates these figures he must despair
of ever bringing a majority of Victorians
round to his way of thinking.
Yet, failing an elective Ministry, Hogan
ought to be the next Premier. His claims
are certainly superior to those of Allan
or Lawson or Peacock. But an elective
Ministry is the right way out of the chaos
of parties and groups and caves. Govern-
ment will be a precarious and unsatisfactory
business—as, indeed, it has been for the
last ten years—until the Administration is
elected.
«
Lister.
It is a hundred years since Joseph Lister
was born. It is but 15 since he died. During
this century modern surgery has been born,
the terrors of the knife have largely
vanished, uncertainty has given place to
confidence, and human suffering has been
alleviated to a splendid extent. At the
time of Lister’s birth surgeons were groping
in the dark. Surgery was a ghastly business.
Hospital gangrene and that fatal form of
blood-poisoning known as pyaemia swept
through a hospital ward as pneumonic
plague sweeps through a community at the
present time. The mortality from the
simplest surgical procedure was appalling.
To send a patient to a surgical ward was
almost tantamount to pronouncing on him
sentence of death. Naturally enough none
but unavoidable operations were undertaken.
At the best, healing took place after the
long-drawn-out discharge of thick creamy
matter, the “laudable pus” of history, and
after much pain and anguish on the part
of the sufferer.
When he started surgical practice, Lister
found a keen delight in the mechanical side
of his work—in “human carpentry.” He
was depressed beyond measure, however, at
the ravages of sepsis. Soon he concluded and
insisted that pus in wounds was due to
the decomposition of blood and serum,
brought about in some way by the atmo-
sphere. He insisted on scrupulous cleanliness
and used deodorising solutions in connec-
tion with his operations. At this time he
heard of the work of Pasteur in France on
fermentation and putrefaction. He instantly
realised that wound suppuration was the
result of bacterial activity. His course was
clear. He introduced antiseptics in the form
of carbolic acid to kill the bacteria. He
applied it to the wound and used a spray
to purify the air. His success was imme-
diate. Wounds healed without pus, but little
pain accompanied the healing process, and
the mortality was reduced beyond expecta-
tions.
Lister’s contemporaries met him with dis-
trust, indifference and often open opposition.
The surgeons on the Continent hailed him as 1 ,
a reformer and a prophet long before those
in London would listen to him. He left
Glasgow and Edinburgh to convert the
London unbelievers. The conversion was a
difficult process and must have been galling
to the inspired soul of this single-minded
man. But he lived to see his work com-
pleted. and died full of years, rich in honor
and with a cup overflowing with the grati-
tude of his fellow creatures.
♦-
The New N.S.W. Industrial Courts.
Badly has cabled his consent to contest the
vice-leadership of the N.S.W. Parliamen-
tary Labor party; and if he wins and for
any reason displaces Lang, Heaven help the
N.S.W. Labor party! Lang is offensive;
Badly is both ignorant and clumsy. His
bunch of bills of last session either crashed
or are marvels of stupidity. The bill that
amended the old Arbitration law is a prime
sample. When there is a dispute the parties
are supposed to go to a conciliation board,
consisting of a chairman and representatives
of the parties, and when it doesn’t settle
anything—it is generally a dud—the matter
goes to the arbitration tribunal, which con-
sists of Mr. Piddington and representatives
of the parties. The position of these repre-
sentatives is like nothing outside comic
opera. They are supposed to be Judges; at
any rate, they sit with the Judge. But they
are in constant communication with their
own side, and there are not many lawyers
with an Industrial Court connection who
haven’t been told privately by some member
or other of the “Bench”: “Make that point”
—indicating something in the case—“as
strong as you can: it impressed Pidding-
ton.” The institution has therefore created
a company of tale-bearers and whisperers
between Bench and parties; and surely few
things could be less fair to the chairman
or more prejudicial to the cause of justice.
And inevitably this mixing of lawyers and
laymen in one tribunal involves confusion
and delay. Apart from the fact that the
laws of evidence are thrown overboard and
the proceedings wander like a blind dog,
to-day this member finds it inconvenient to,
attend and to-morrow this one is otherwise
engaged; and in the struggle to oblige every-
body cases are taken at odd times and then
adjourned, and on the adjournment counsel
think it their duty to go over the whole
matter again, with the result that there are
endless repetitions and delays.
« ■
Cows and Their Husbands.
A change in Australian methods of beef
breeding was hinted at by one of the cattle
judges at Sydney show, G. B. Waller. He
thinks the recommendation of the Cattle
Breeders’ Society to limit the age at which
cattle can be exhibited would have a far-
reaching effect. This year the age-limit in
Sydney has been fixed at five years; next
year it will drop to four years. The idea
is that young cattle should be pushed for-
ward in condition, and not allowed to waste
a couple of valuable years before being
topped up for market. Younger beef means
better prices and a wider demand in the
open markets, as the Argentine has shown.
It is all good, sound sense. But of course
it isn’t enough. J. B. Cramsie, chairman
of the N.S.W. Meat Board, declares that
increases in land values and the rise in
cost of production and transport, plus ever-
mounting taxation, make it practically
impossible to show a profit on raising sheep
or cattle for meat, and that the outlook is
growing steadily worse. He declares that
Canada and the U.S.A. are perturbed, too,
and are doing all in their power to aid
producers. The Argentine’s attention to its
great primary industry is a commonplace
of the trade. Only in Australia do Govern-
ments neglect or set out to destroy a once-
flourishing industry.
For years the Federal Government, by
ignoring the North-South railway, has
allowed Australia's greatest beef-producing
area to remain cut off from the big southern
markets, its only means of access being the
long droving routes that take a ruinous toll
of cattle, in addition to lowering their
quality as beef. Queensland, with raised
rents and land taxes added to the imbecile
head tax which led to the destruction of
thousands of calves, has played the samp
destructive role. The two essentials to the
revival of the industry in North Queens-
land and the Territory are a measure of
Government encouragement and assistance,
and especially the provision of adequate
transport to market. Any isolated wild-cat
show which can command a few votes is
supplied with rail communication, if it only
shrieks loud enough. An industry which
annually exports beef alone to the value of
one and a half million, as it did in 1923-24 —
in 1920-21 the value was nearly four millions
—ought to be worth a trunk line with a
branch or two of the pattern which criss-
crosses the Argentine cattle areas, especially
as such transport links would automatically
increase their own fre’ahtings.
The Athlete and the Reject.
Addressing a North Sydney sporting
gathering, V. Horniman, a prominent figure
in N.S.W. amateur athletics, had some
pertinent remarks to make about the
Federal Government’s attitude towards ath-
letics, especially the continued imposition of
the amusements tax on the receipts of purely
amateur athletics and games organisations.
Taking for his text the very high percentage
of youths rejected as unfit for military
service in Australia, he insisted that the
amateur organisations were doing great
work for the Defence scheme in fitting their
members to become, not only athletes, but
sound and healthy citizens. This work, as
the speaker truly claimed, was done for
sport’s sake and without fee or reward, which
made the Federal tax on the funds gathered
to maintain the organisations the more
unjust, especially as the reduction in the
tax benefited the sporting bodies no further
than it did dividend-making concerns like
picture-shows.
Everything is to be said for the removal
of the taxes from genuinely amateur ath-
letic sports and games that improve the
nation’s stamina. But if the tax is removed
those who control sport must see to it that
athletics do in fact help to make young
Australians fit for Defence service. At
present there is some reason to believe that
the boot is on the other foot. Intensive
training of children from 10 years up in
all manner of field games and athletic con-
tests has of late years grown to inordinate
dimensions throughout Australia, and it is at
least a curious coincidence that the percen-
tage of rejects among youths has risen
during the same period.
The Great White Prize.
The abrogation of the British-Japanese
treaty was due in part, to Britain’s desire
to simplify a closer relationship with U.S.A.
—apparently a vain hope while Uncle
Dollar is in his newly-rich state. Recently the
Japan Chronicle was quite frank about
Nippon’s position. “We find ourselves,”
it said, “preparing for the next war.” And,
again: “Both America and Britain are con-
sidering plans for the domination of the
Pacific. The limitation of armaments is
unsuited at the moment to Japan.”
There is no doubt whatever that the
yearly increase of the population of Japan
and the perpetual earthquake holocausts are,
in themselves, causes of anxiety, to put it
mildly, in the minds of Japanese thinkers
and leaders; and their eyes, more than
usually narrowed, are glued contemplatively
on possible acquisitions further afield—
apparently in the Pacific.
Still everything is all right. We’ve got
a couple of new submarines, to say nothing
of a few extra racing days.

The Opening - .
“J.E.”: It is my opinion that Fuss is a
nuisance and that gilded Pomp and tin-
selled Circumstance are vain things. The
official opening of Canberra is the matter
which I have in mind. It might save a
great deal of confusion, heart-burning,
inconvenience, jealousy, recrimination,
muddle, misunderstanding, pocket-picking,
drink, disappointment, mismanagement,
public incompetence, and other malignant
nouns, including the possible mixing-up of
families, if Parliament and the Civil Ser-
vice and his Excellency just arrived by
train and got to work. They could pretend
they had been there all the time. Canberra
is quite capable of opening itself, as the
world did and as Australia did. I can find
no record of the official opening of London
or Paris or Damascus. Jerusalem had no
formal opening which remains on record,
though there were certainly some doings at
the beginning of the Temple. The details
are scanty, but it is alleged, that Solomon,
the king, slew 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep,
which seems a great and horrid mess, after
which the nation went home to its tents;
and tents appear poverty-stricken, habita-
tions. Probably the Israelites found them
burgled.
At time of writing one view is that the
general uninvited public will arrive at
’Berra for the opening in 50,000 motor-
cars, which will make a scene and an orgy.
Another is that the cars of the uninvited
will number only five, which will be a fiasco.
It is just possible that 49,995 individuals
may stay away because they hate the crush
of 50,000, and fear to be trodden underfoot.
Further, they will have a justifiable dread
of bitter weather. If the uninvited do come
it will be to gaze on the invited, and point,
out those who shouldn’t have been invited
at all. The invited will get swelled head
and make innumerable enemies. The in-
vidious differentiation between the person
who was just good enough to be the last, of
the few chosen and the individual who was
just bad enough to be first among the multi-
tude omitted will be only the beginning
of the trouble. The invited will dislike each
other, just as much as they are disliked
by the uninvited, because they can’t all
have front seats, and most of them won’t
hear much; and, besides, many of the desir-
able seats will be jumped by pushful out-
siders, who will have to be removed,
struggling, by the police. I doubt if the
police have any safe and sufficient place
wherein to put them when they are
removed. If there is any such place it
is almost sure to be full of burglars and
pickpockets before the real ceremony
commences. The balance of the arrestees,
including the Red Flag demonstration, will
have to be tied to trees, where their
language may cast a shadow on the pro-
ceedings.
Another attraction will, of course, be the
presence of the Duke, but it would be more
reposeful if he stayed away and telephoned.
The only function which is never grossly
blundered is the one which doesn’t happen,
and it leaves behind it no squalid debris
of bottles, paper and partially-bitten sand-
wiches.
Air Pilots in the War.
“F.E.S.”: In the war histories nothing is
still ever said about the fact that at least
half the pilots of the Imperial Services in
France in 1917 and 1918 came from the
Dominions; and I am not including the
Australian Flying Corps, either. The only
books in which Dominion fliei's receive fail-
recognition are the memoirs of German
generals.
The one British publication which does
throw some light on the subject is the
“Encyclopaedia Britannica” (Post-war
Appendix), wherein the number of Cana-
dians who went overseas with the British
fljdng services is given as 12.902. These
were nearly all officer pilots. But the
article on Australia is quite inadequate;
the casualties are stated, but no figures at
all are given of officers in English regiments
or air services. The Air Force staff-college
figure for the Australian flying officers in
the war is 3700. Thus including Maori-
lahders and South Africans the total of
Dominion pilots must have been over 17,000.
Now the total number of commissions
granted in the Naval Air Service, the Flying
Corps and the hybrid Air Force into which
they were amalgamated on April 1, 1918,
was 36,000, though at least 40 p.c. were (or
very soon became) permanent staff or
ground officers. Many Diggers will recob
lect the marvellous array ot blue and khaki
brass-hats of the Air Ministry; in 1913
(according to the London Observer) there
were more officers in the Air Ministry doing
clerical work than there were pilots irf
France. But I heard of only one Canadian
being in the Air Ministry, and I knew onty
one Australian and two Canadians who did
not stick to flying up to the Armistice. Per-
haps we were a shade uncouth for staff con-
versations and ground duties.
I cannot speak for the Flying Corps (ex-
cept that every second officer I met in
France spoke with a Canadian accent), but
in the Royal Naval Air Service in France
the position at the end of 1917 was as fol-
lows. Out of seven Naval squadrons near
the town of Dunkirk, four were commanded
by Australians — B. C. Bell, Goble, Dallas
(the best man I ever met; he was killed in
an air fight when he was a colonel) and
myself. Flight-Commander Little, an
Australian, up to the time he was killed had
shot down more enemy aircraft than anyone
else in the R.N.A.S. His bag was over 40, and
he had nearly the same number of crashes
himself. Collishaw, a Canadian, was second
to Little at the time, but he survived the
war with over 60 enemy machines shot down.
Two of the other squadrons had only one
English pilot each; both these officers are
still in the R.A.F. — Huskisson, who com-
manded No. 4 Squadron, and Ellavood, of
No. 3, which was commanded by a Canadian.
In my own squadron ive had so many Cana-
dians that we played a baseball game with
the Lafayette Escadrille (those very sport-
ing Americans who got tired of waiting for
the U.S.A. to come into the Avar, and so
became naturalised Frenchmen in order to
fly on the French side), and we beat them.
That Avas on the Dunkirk flying-ground.
Further, it is interesting to know that the
son of a German family resident here had
gone to Berlin to study before the war, and
he subsequently became one of the most
famous German aces; so we had to supply
pilots to both sides.
The British Government advertised for
pilots in Canada, but not here, although
Australia had sent over the greatest
civilian pilot before the war Harry
Hawker. Haavker tried to join the
Naval Air Service at the outbreak, but was'
told that, as he had been a mechanic,
he could only be enlisted as a petty officer;
at the time he held the British altitude
and duration records. After telling the
Admiralty exactly what he thought of the
decision he carried on with the difficult and
dangerous work of testing experimental
aeroplanes as a civilian.
If, then, anyone ever comes across a
dealing with the exploits of some frightfully
intrepid birdman (I belkwe some ladies still
read war romances) it is at least an even
chance that in civil life he would be a
common colonial.

Do Reformatories Reform?
‘ Old Warder”: With many years of reform-
atory experience behind me I have formed
a few definite opinions about the treatment
of juveniles. Give the lads good food, regular
Avork, technical education, teach them to
keep regular hours, and let them have their
fun in swimming, cricket and football, and
they do well—Avhile Ave have them, But
there is no co-ordinated, directed oversight
of the boys after Ave have finished Avith them.
They are told to report weekly to the pro-
bation officer. They do it, but they live
once again in their old bad environment,
get in with the same push—there is no one
to stop them —and back they come, to end
up probably as habitual criminals. No
matter how we improve our reformatory
methods, the final result will be the same
until a wise system of after-care is insti-
tuted.
Probation officers are necessary at the
other end too. Every truant should have
his case investigated by such an officer,
and the remedy applied there and then. If
reformatory treatment does become neces-
sary, the boy should be cared for after his
term is up. We want farmers—good
farmers, men who know hoAV to treat their
Avorkmen —to be prepared to take our boys
and continue the good Avork we have started.
We want business men Avho will take the
best boys of our technical classes and give
them decent jobs—something they will be
proud to hold. And we want enough pro-
bation officers—men properly trained for the
job—to tactfully shepherd both our boys
and their bosses until the lads find their
feet.
It will cost money; but then it costs
money to run our prisons, and they can’t
turn criminals into decent citizens. A proper
reformatory system can.

After wrestling ‘with the biggest strike in
British history and providing £50,000,000 in
reduction of debt, the man in charge of J.
Bull’s cash-box finished the year with a
deficit of 36jr millions, or about 16s. 6d. per
inhabitant. There are Australian States
which can do as badly as that Avith no big
strike, no contribution worth mentioning to
the sinking fund, and after borrowing £5
or more per inhabitant. Yet some of John
B.’s papers are grumbling at Churchill.

A legal visitor from overseas attended one
sitting of the High Court in Sydney, and
made a single comment. “It’s a pity,” he
said, “that your Judges can’t conceal their
dislike of each other a little better.”

POLITICAL
POINTS
The Allancocks (Vic.) will hang on till
after the departure of the Yorks; they will
then either get out voluntarily or wait for
the boot when the new Leg Assembly meets.
It looks as if Hogan, the Labor leader, will
be given a commission to form a new Gov-
ernment. Pie commands only 28 votes,
whereas there are of members on the other
side; but the 37 comprise 15 Nashers, four
near-Nasliers, 10 Allan Cockies, four Dun-
stan Cockies, two sorts of Liberals and two
of Independents. McPherson has been men-
tioned both as Speaker and reconciler of the
discordant non-Labor elements. He will be
wiser to take the chair if he can get it.
Victorian electors got their first taste of
compulsion, as far as State politics are con-
cerned, at the recent head-counting. Despite
the usual solemn warnings, 80,000 failed to
turn up at the polls. And the polls would
have been all the better if another 80,000
had stayed away.
It is stated in a matter-of-fact way that
another railway strike is preparing in
Queensland. The Arbitration Court couldn’t
see its way to order another increase of
wages, in view of the two-million deficit,
and “direct action” is the usual result. In
such a case the Government may try to do
without railways for a time, though such a
policy would be bad for the next loan.
The Rump A.L.P. Conference, for which
Seale, the expelled president, and the Reds
of Sydney Trades and Labor Council were
responsible, had some mirthful features. One
sportive union, in accepting an invitation
to take part in the proceedings, named as its
representative a leader of the faction which
threw Seale out. He didn’t turn up, but
another expulsionist did and offered a humble
apology, explaining that he was the victim
of a “misunderstanding.” The conference
nevertheless included the apologetic gentle-
man in the sentence it passed on the anti-
Seale faction, which was disqualification for
three years; the anti-Seale faction will, no
doubt, pass him out for life. The conference
also declared Premier Lang a leader after
its heart, since “lie does what his followers
tell him”; then it expelled his Assembly
majority; ordered him to throw Mutch
Fitzgerald and Coates out of his Ministry;
instructed him to go to the country at once,
if not sooner, and dispersed, having spent a
thoroughly happy day, even if it was wet.
It is marvellous how the State electoral
population of Westralia increases when Labir
is in office. At the 1914 State and Federal
elections, which were held within a fo>v
weeks of one another, 214,741 electors were
enrolled for the State and only 182,107
for the Commonwealth, although the fran-
chise was the same. The State rolls used
for last month’s election contained 210,949
names and the Commonwealth rolls 192,-±l)2.
The Westralian achievement rivals Queens-
land’s ; when Labor was routed in the
Federal sphere, there were 406,228 electors
in 1922 and 440,851 in 1925, and when the
State Labor Government won hands down
there were 476,387 electors in 1923 and
478,097 in 1925. It would be a great eon-
A r enience and saving if the Commonwealth
made up the State rolls, but Westralian and
Queensland Laborites protest that it would
be a brutal interference with State rights.
The Ministry led by J. A. Lyons in Tas-
mania is the one reasonably happy Labor
crowd in Australia. At the party conference
the other day the Government was applauded
and praised; and, though there was some
criticism of railway management, the teach-
ing of sex hygiene in schools, the Govern-
ment’s taxation policy, etc., Premier Lyons
and other Ministers had no difficulty in
meeting the criticism and securing the unani-
mous commendation of the conference. Every
one of the four Ministers who stood for
election on the A.L.P. executive was success-
ful ; the previous year’s conference turned
two of them down for executive positions.
A day before the Vic. election a Mel-
bourne paper catechised six women of all
social grades as to what they knew about
the subject. One business woman knew the
names of her two candidates, but did not
know which was Lab. and which was Nat.
Another said she would read the paper on
election-day and learn all about it. Another
knew the name of the man she would vote
for, but didn’t know whether he was Nat.
or Lab. A housewife said her husband
would tell her what to do. Yet Victorian
women have been Commonwealth electors
since 1901 and State electors since 1909.
Incidentally, J. Bull is about to give Miss
Shingle the franchise at 21. instead of 30,
which means that the dear creatures will
have a voting preponderance of 2,000,000, at
least.
PARTY GOVERNMENT HOLDS UP TEE TRAFFIC.
“Responsible government is temporarily held up in Vic. while the 10 political parties decide who
won the recent elections.”
The S. M. Herald is in these days a Free-
trade maniac only in its financial column.
There it wanted to know the other day why,
seeing that goldmining is in a bad way, Pro-
tectionists don’t advocate a 50 p.c. duty on
imported gold. They don’t advocate it for
the same reason that they neglect to put an
import duty on icebergs. Icebergs are not
imported, so a duty of 1000 p.c. wouldn’t
reduce the number of imported icebergs on
the local market. And, anyway, even if gold
poured into this country in payment for our
wool and wheat, it, wouldn’t damage our gold
production—it would improve it. It is when
gold is plentiful that the prospector is kept
busy.
Bruce discoursed vaguely, as usual, at
the Agricultural Society’s luncheon in Syd-
ney about the need for population and the
haggard and well-worn fact that our title
to some of Australia may yet be called in
question if we don’t get it. Still, Australia
acquired 118,430 extra inhabitants during
last year, which wasn’t bad, and it has gained
674,780 since the census of 1921. Unfortu-
nately tlie N. Territory, which is more than
one-sixth of the continent and which is
under Bruce’s direct control, has gained only
1054 people since 1921, and it is the Terri-
tory’s miserable tally of 4921 inhabitants
which advertises the lack of a valid title to
Empty Australia. There being no separate
figures for the north of Queensland or
Westralia their vacancy doesn’t howl aloud to
all the world, but the Territory’s does. There
are no visible remedies save the South-to-
North railway, the freehold land system, and
a better steamboat service. Bruce’s Govern-
ment moves at the pace of half a snail on
the railway matter, and makes no pace
whatever otherwise.
A dishevelled event lately befell in the
Irish Free State Parliament. One of those
members whose sturdy Republicanism pre-
vents them taking the oath of allegiance
and coming in, made a sacrifice, lie took
the oath and came in. Then he moved that
the oath he had taken should be abolished
because he and his friends couldn’t take it.
If sufficient of them had taken it, even though
they couldn’t, the motion might have been a
success. Half-measures spoiled the game.
Some candidates for the Vic. Assembly
election found it difficult to keep within the
£l5O limit of exes. Since the figure was
fixed, prices charged for everything the
schedule allows have gone up, even hall hire.
On the other hand, voting is now compulsory,
and less leverage is needed. The lowest
amount ever spent on a Vic. election was a
penny. That much was paid by J. M.
Davies for a duty stamp on a cheque drawn
for his deposit when he re-nominated for
Melb. Province of the Leg. Council in 1907.
He was re-elected unopposed. Before the
limitation Act was passed, Gomrie, M.L.C.
(now under tlie sod), scattered £7OOO in
capturing a north-west seat.
An early job for Labor is to define wliat it
means by “the socialisation of industry." At
the Tasmanian Labor Conference the ques-
tion was raised, and it was “assumed” that
what was meant was the handing over of
control of any suitable industry to the people
engaged in it. But the handing over of, say,
the wheat business to the farmers doesn't
provoke many lioorays at the Trades Hall;
so some members of the party think they had
better amend the “socialisation" plank in
some way. It is wonderful how many of the.
old planks look different after they have been
used for a while.
Rev. J. Barr, Labor member for Mother-
well, has circulated a Scottish Home Rule
Bill, and the other 24 Scottish Labor mem-
bers are backing him. The reverend’s idea
is that Scotland should quit the House of
Commons altogether and have a one-House
Legislature of its own to deal with local
affairs. At present Scottish members of the
Commons are not very many, the population
being small, but their capacity for securing
places in the Cabinet is very large, and
their mortgage on the Prime Ministership is
remarkable. The idea of the secessionists is
doubtless that Labor might capture the small
Scottish Parliament and hold all the poor
little portfolios, but the parties which are in
the running, and are running like the very
deuce, for the rich billets iq London and the
Imperial appointments abroad can't be ex-
pected to see the matter in the same light.
The utterly lion-constructive demagogue
must always be. advocating the destruction
of something; hence a recent outburst of
Premier Lang’s:—
Many country towns arc stagnant because they are
surrounded by large estates employing only a few
men, whereas they could easily provide homes for
thousands of successful small farmers. The large
grazier has to be made to feel his responsibility to
the State. At present he is unwilling to subdivide.
Outside Sydney, its suburbs and pleasure re-
sorts. and outside a few mining centres, the
X.S.W. figure-man enumerates 101 incorpor-
ated towns. These and the numerous townlets
are not all shut in by big estates, for there
are not sufficient big estates to go round. But
all the little towns do suffer from the lack
of urban industries. Even the butter-factory
isn’t very numerous and only exists pending
the invention of a method of sending the
milk to Sydney through pipes.
Rebuffed in the country as well as in
the Assembly, ex-Premier Lawson (Vic.) is
not pleased with himself or with the friends
who egged him on to the two ventures
which brought failure. He was persuaded
to relinquish the Premiership (held for six
years) and go for the Speakership on the death
of Mackey, in 1924. Nominating, be was
beaten by Bowser. Campaign leader for the
Nationalists in the recent confused struggle,
and acclaimed as a political Peter the Her-
mit, he brought back a score of seats, instead
of the 35 aimed at, and the casualties in-
cluded Sam Barnes, Dave Oman and Fred
Eggleston, three of his former Ministerial
colleagues. His disappointed followers are
now saying that he should have insisted
upon the resignation of the six Nashers from
the Cornpo. Cabinet on the day of the dis-
solution, so that, there should be no hobbles
of any kind. But it is unfair to make
him a scapegoat. The party is to blame, not
the man.
Higher pay for Vic. Assembly members was
kept in the background during the recent
election campaign, but there is little doubt
that Hogan will submit a bill if he becomes
Premier. In fact, this may he his trump
card when the game begins again. Labor
members have advocated up to £750 a year,
but £625 would not be sneezed at. Lawson
had £2OO added in 1920 to the £3OO which
was then the amount paid. Of course if any-
thing is tacked on to members’ screws, Mini-
sters, the Speaker and the Chairman of
Committees will get similar lifts. There may
even be an increment for M’s.L.C.
Wliat Sydney’s municipal milk supply will
be like, if and when it gets one, it would
take a pretty lurid imagination to prophesy.
But the venture in Wellington (M.L.) has
brought about a considerable improvement in
the quality and cleanliuess of milk supplied,
and it is paying its own way. After four
years of operation it has written off £13,000
of over-capitalisation, has £6OOO in hand for
extensions, and lias a reserve fund of £lO,OOO,
which will be applied to selling milk at a
loss during the winter months. The Welling-
ton system has had the benefit of supervision
by experienced business men who gave their
services free because of their enthusiasm for
the experiment. In Sydney the danger would
be that politicians would take charge and
run the thing into the ground.
The day-labor system is not unanimously
popular even in Queensland. Maryborough
is a town with no money to burn, and it
wanted some more hospitals. The Public
Works Department offered, as usual, to do
the work, its price being £49,000 and as
much more as the bill happened to run to.
A contractor made a firm offer at £37,00(1
Maryborough then proposed to skimp its
hospital, .and the Public Works’ new price
was £44,000 and the rest. The contractor
got the job at £BO,OOO. He will have to
employ the same kind of men as the State,
hut evidently they work differently pri-
vate enterprise. The solid resolve of State
enterprisers to bring State enterprise into
disrepute is a curious trait.
“F.S.”: When the House of Reps had
voted £50,000 to Victoria to commemorate
the 26 years’ loan of the State legislative
foundry, members leaned back and dreamed
of an elegant dome or an equestrian group
that would stand as an everlasting witness
to Melbourne’s political golden age. J>m
they reckoned without the almost unma tellable
stodginess of the present collection of )m-
-torian State legislators. Various suggestions
for spending the money have been advances
but it was reserved for Minister for Public
Works Goudie to reduce the gesture to the
level of slapstick comedy. He proposes that
the money should he expended on improving
the dining-room and kitchen.

“Morwell”: That yarn of the £5-r.ote
trick for publicans (B. 31/3/’27) reminds
me of a point Avorked on a “croAvn and
anchor king” at one of the camps on Salis-
bury Plain. A, crumpled 10s. note was the
only offering on the anchor, Avhicli duly
turned up when the dice rolled out. The
“king” tendered another 10s. note in pay-
ment, but the investor objected. “Five pound
ten while you’re at it,” and unrolled his
stake, disclosing a fiver coyly nestling in-
side the smaller note. Of course, had he
lost he would have instantly grabbed back
the notes and handed over 10s. in silver.
The “king” cursed considerably, but decided
to pay. After that he made it a rule of
the game that all wagers in paper should

was going to take up some diplomatic post.
An interfering stuck-up pig he was, but his
missus was a daisy. We were all in love
with her, and if she'd fallen overboard
every rating on the ship would have dived
after her in a moment.” I asked what he
thought would have happened had it been
the husband who overbalanced. “Oh, him!
He’d have got the regulation issue of life-
buoys—and a depth-charge on top of ’em!”
“Gordelphus” : Just back from a hot time
in the front line, Ave were in a rest-camp
near Wipers and sleeping in good beds for
the first time in weeks. It was a bitterly
cold night, and we had all turned in when
the unmistakable drone of a Bosch 'plane
was heard. Presently there was a crash
away to the right, and every light in the
camp was promptly extinguished except one.
“Hi, Jim !” came shouts from all along the
line, “put out that light.” “It's all
right,” said Jim, who had air-force ambitions
and was outside listening, “she’s dropped her
bundle and gone home.” “Never mind; put
out that light and go to bed.” Jim
didn’t, and no one else was game to turn
out into the bitter cold to do it. There was
another crash far off and another blas-
phemous chorus directed at the recalcitrant
one. “Don’t be so windy,” sang out. Jim;
“she’s dropped her bundle, I tell you, an’ she’s
makin’ for home for the lick of her fife.”
The drone of the bomber swung round and
came closer; there was a terrific crash along-
side the camp; Jim’s hut collapsed on his
light and all was uproar and confusion.
Then above it all leaped Jim’s voice: “It’s
all right, boys ; she’s dropped her bundle and
she’s headin’ for home!” The Digger growled
like the hounds of Hell; but he was an
incurable optimist, all the same.
“Con”: Gum-spitting championships (B.
31/3/’27) may be the latest recreation of the
Yankee he-man, but some of New Jersey’s
Avomankind recently competed in a screaming
competition. The prize (five dollars) went
to the owner of the lungs that pnmded the
loudest and longest yell of fear. At Coney
Island another dead-game sport won the liot-
doc championship by absorbing 28 of these
delicacies in 12 minutes.
“H.K.”: Although “no commandant or
magistrate could string up criminals off-hand
in the bad old days” (B. 7/4/’27) summary
jurisdiction could be savage, and often was.
“This day,” intimated the Sydney Gazette
of September 25. 1813, “a bench of magis-
trates assembled, before whom Tomasso
O'Bragb, a foreigner, was convicted of an
assault, and ordered to receive 100 lashes
at Parramatta on Thursday next; to stand
in the pillory for an hour on the Thursday
following; to be imprisoned in a solitary
cell one month on bread and water only;
and to be afterwards sent to the Coal River
(Newcastle), there to labor in the mines.”
“Bouragi” : Measles are the curse of primi-
tive peoples. Among the Western Pacific
natives, the nursery disease, which the white
man is accustomed to take for granted,
COMPETITION.
BARKE : "My wife and I never quarrel. What you thinka that?"
CLARKE: “Not bad! Now I'll tell one."
becomes as a lire in long, dry grass. Papua,
which has suffered a lot in the past, is again
threatened with a universal epidemic, and
quarantine has been established in all the
ports. Measles is a simple enough matter if
quiet and warmth can be compelled, but with
the Island native that is almost impossible.
The fever drives him into cool sea or river
for relief, and the result is pneumonia. Early
in the present century Papua was swept from
end to end by a measles epidemic. On the
Mamba River the death-rate must have been
20 per cent., though a correct estimate was
impossible. Measles first came to the South
Seas with the London Missionary Society,
which, in the early days, clad its converts in
second-hand clothing sent from London. The
toll of life it has taken since then, from the
Marquesas to the Carolines and from the
Paumotos to Hawaii, is beyond all counting.
“MacWhustler” : .Underlying a recent con-
troversy in Melbourne art circles is the
resentment which has been smouldering for
a long time between two rival camps over a
matter of which the public knows nothing. A
number of Melbourne artists formed a syndi-
cate to acquire a gallery in which they could
hang their works and make,a little profit out
of hanging the works of other artists. Some
of the newspaper critics joined the scheme.
These critics are, no doubt, conscientious
fellows, so those brusli-wielders who darkly
aver that, if you don’t exhibit in this gallery,
your show held elsewhere is liable to be
damned, heartily or with faint praise, are
probably actuated by mere sordid prejudice
and envy. Still, it is unfortunate for the
cause of art that this notion should have
got about.
* * * *
“lan C.”: Esme Joyce Horwood, a Ben-
digo (Vic.) two-year-old, put up a remark-
able feat the other day. She fell down an
abandoned shaft. Her dad hastily got
himself lowered, expecting the worst, and
found his daughter sitting on a bunch of
brambles 50 feet below wondering what
the little game was and whose move it was
next. A few scratches were the extent of
her injuries.
“Black Tracker” : Re table crockery, etc.,
that looks as if it had been souven-
ired (B. 31/3/’27). I remember one
suspect who was able to put up an
excellent defence. A prosperous piggery
owner, who had contracts with all the leading
hotels in an Australian capital for the
removal of kitchen offal, gave a very elaborate
spread on the occasion of his daughter’s wed-
ding. There was a very fine display of table-
ware, particularly cutlery, and guests couldn't
help noticing that many of the articles bore
either the names or initials of well-known
pubs. Some stickybeSk mentioned the matter
to a manager whose inventory showed a
marked shortage. He got in touch with the
owner of another hotel, who proved to have
the same grievance. Both thereupon decided
to visit the pigman’s home and make
inquiries. The lady of the house welcomed
them, and openly admitted that she had a
very fine collection of assorted eating tackb‘
which had taken years to accumulate. She
further pointed out that her husband bought
everything that went into the garbage tubs.
The husband, however, when interviewed later,
proved more reasonable, consenting to return
everything that was positively identifiable.
Doubtless he had his eye on future contracts.

“Eurilla” (King’s College, Cambridge) :
“Dr. Nil” (B. !)/12/’26) contrasts unfavorably
the system of “cadging” by school children
in Australia with the sturdy independence
maintained in such matters “when he was a
boy in Staffordshire.” I am not concerned
with the rest of his article, but when he
says that in Australia “the youth of both
sexes even at the Universities sell tickets for
their annual balls, instead of presenting them
to their friends, as is the custom in Britain,”
lie crashes badly. In Britain, so far from
tickets being “presented” to anyone for
University balls, a profiteering figure is
demanded. An Adelaide Uni.-ball ticket is
a guinea (if I remember rightly—for a
couple), whereas any of the college balls at
Cambridge have a starting price of two
guineas for a single ticket, and get up to
four and five before they sell out. I know,
because I’ve had to fork out in each place.
“34th”: Whether or not some men have
constitutions immune to strong drink, as
recent Bulletin contributors have asserted,
it is certain that some Diggers took much
less harm, than others from the effects of
gas. When Fritz put over his big mustard-
gas attack at Villers-Bretonneux in June,
TB, I shared the shelter of a tarpaulin with
seven other men. Six of these were carried
out during the day blind and vomiting, but
the writer and the remaining man suffered
no ill effects, apart from badly-watering eyes.
Yet we all got the same issue.
A FAILURE’S FIFTIETH BIRTHDAY.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Of all men I alone esteem it worth
The trouble to compose a little lay
In memory of my advent on the earth
Just half a century ago to-day.
Of this event no other bard shall sing;
No gun shall boom, no flag shall be un-
furled,
No drum shall beat, no bell shall gaily ring,
To give the information to the world.
My life? A record of ambition foiled,
Attempts to do a mediocre best,
Each effort to accomplish something spoiled
And seemingly more futile than the rest.
A friend or two, perhaps, will have a spot
With me to mark my happy natal day.
.Conceivably Ave may get slightly shot,
That is provided I’m prepared to pay.
Of course, I knoAV that if a man has health,
And if a conscience limpid clear be his,
He has no use for honor, fame or wealth,
He’s quite contented. Yes. .. . Like Hell
he is!

“Loco”; I asked our railway guard, who
has some humming cargo in liis clattering
van at times, for a professional opinion as
to whether noise destroys the sense of smell
(B. 3/3/’27). “Rats!” he said. “I was
running a liunt-club special not long ago
and somebody blundered and forgot to pro-
vide the usual cattle-truck for the hounds.
It was only a short run, and to avoid a heap
of ‘please explains’ for delay in getting a
truck I let them put the whole pack in
the van. There were 25 of them, and the
faster we travelled the more noise they
made, and the more they yelped the more
they smelt.”
* * * #
“Flagwagger”: Some people make queer
use of the polling booth. During the recent
Victorian election a young lady entered a
Melbourne suburban booth
and, holding out a small
package, requested a poll
clerk to give it to Tom
Blank, of 10 Dash-street,
when he called to vote.
She added, “He will un-
derstand.” The poll clerk
hesitated, saying some-
thing about it being
against the regulations,
and a lady scrutineer at
the table obligingly cut
in with “Give it to me.
I’ll see that Mr. Blank
gets it.” Later, Blank
received his ballot-paper
and the package, and
walked to a box. ' A min-
ute later he emerged with
tears in his eyes and the
contents of the package
in his hand. It was an
engagement ring. The
turned-down lover left his
ballot-paper behind un-
marked.

“O. Giddup”: The
gripmau on the North
Melbourne tram pulled
hard at the bell and his
shouts might have been
heard in Sydney, but the
navvy ignored it all. Con-
sequently the dummy
spreadeagled him on the
blue-metal. “He can’t say
I didn’t sing out, an’ I
rung the William Tell
loud enough. He musta
been deaf,” said the grip-
pic. The tram stopped,
and the conductor went
back; but, jumping up,
the knight of the road for-
gave everybody and again
seized his pick. “Right
away!” called the con-
ductor. “No harm done.
He’s a bit deaf.” “He
must be,” said the post-
man, the painter and the
woman with the large
basket, and they proceed-
ed to discuss the case of
this navvy and deaf nav-
vies in general. But the
little inau in a sort of
Baget coat on the left-
hand front said nothing,
though he seemed to be
thinking hard. The tram
went nine blocks before
he addressed the gripman.
“That feller, the one you
knocked over,” he said—
"l think he must have
been a bit deaf. I’m get-
ting a little that way my-
self, y’know.”
* *
“Axle Grease”: The
bearded stranger had only
arrived at Durundur (Q.)
that day and the boss had
taken him on. After tea
we were yarning in front
of the fire when Harry
Green and the new hand
started an argument. Each
claimed to have driven
the first team from Mary-
borough to Gympie. Then
Larry chipped in: “I
don’t know which of you
drove the first team in,
but I know this much.: I was offsider for the
one that did,” said he. The stranger stared
hard at him. “Great Scott!” he said, “you
must be my brother Larry.” And he was.
The pair hadn’t met for 25 years.
* * * *
“Six-and-Eight”: Before leaving town after
a flying visit to the Show last year, Longwool
bought a noble sirloin, for all through the
summer he had lived on mutton. Had he
killed a bullock in the hot weather, most of
it would have been wasted, and. Longwool
bated waste. Next day Loin-wool's “clioom”
cook arrived at the homestead on the next-
door holding and gasped out a hair-raising
yarn of how, but for his fleetness, Long-
wool’s attempt to murder him with an axe
would have been successful. The only ex-
planation the sergeant got when he went to
investigate was that “the boiled the
roast!” The sergeant remembered his early
years of back-country service, when for aeons
i i i 1* i i i ~ ti-3-3
ie bad lited on boiled mutton, and decided
that Longwool s explanation was both satis-
factory and sufficient.
« * * *
“Tamornie”: In many parts of New
Huine-i m vlmntino- «tnv i« roooivbul a« n
tiuinta, a snooting stai is regarded as a
portent of death, but m only one instance
did I hear the deceased named. An old
woman was a member of a group outside my
store one night. As a meteor flared across
the heavens she wailed, “Eka! Paru he die
finish, Paru he die finish.” Sure enough,
within half an hour the drums were boom-
ing in the village across the bay as they
relayed the news of Paru’s death from the
old woman’s village 40 miles away.
* * * *
“X.D.”: The joke about the Jew and the
fire-insurance policy is such a hardy chest-
nut that nobody takes it seriously nowadays,
but it made a surprise appearance in a Mel-
bourne court the other day. A barrister
asked a Jewish witness whether he had not
’phoned a lady of the same race and asked
her to congratulate him on the fact that his
fire had been a “great success.” Counsel for
the other side sat up as if he had been shot and
demanded permission to re-examine witness,
from whom he elicited that an adjuster had
visited the property and paid the amount
forthwith. “Then you should have been con-
gratulated,” murmured Costs as he resumed
his seat, whereat the Court was all smiles
again. Incidentally, that rare visitor to an
Australian court, a Yiddish interpreter, had
to translate most of the evidence.
“X2X”: In the recent symposium on
poisons nobody has mentioned that arsenic
has always been the favorite of the far-sighted
murderer —not because of its toxic properties,
which actually are less than those of many
other poisons, but because, administered in
large doses, it produces symptoms which
correspond exactly with those of various
AFTER THE BATTLE.
THE FEDERAL BACKERS : “My gracious, how did he get like that, Alick?”
TRAINER PEACOCK: “Dunno, gents. ’E went through all the correct motions like, but some’[?] he don’t seem to ’are
no punch left.”
gastro-intestinal complaints, Many persons
must have been, and probably some are
still, occasionally certified as having died from
natural causes when in reality they have been
poisoned with arsenic. Nowadays, the chance
of this occurring is much more remote than
it was 50 years ago, because diagnosis lias
been developed to a higher point, and also
because the doctor relies more on the diagnos-
tic services of the chemical analyst than he
once did. There is always, no doubt, the
possibility of the doctor being deceived, but
it is hardly worth chancing these days.
“Detonator”: The following touching
epistle was received by our Camel Corps
Interpreter, from his father-in-law, who
prided himself on his knowledge of English:
To may dear sun-in-laws, salute big one. First,
Ibn el Sharmoota, I sand yous may best salams and
I kiss your eyes. your wife, Bint el Mahrass,
kisses your eyes. Your letter we have. You brother
wife, Bint el Acroot, has died (may your life be
long), but brought into the world some childs. The
childs she also come a gutzer. What can I say
about the decrees of God? Your brother, Maknoon
Bookra, has been taken for a soldier by Government;
may Government come gutzer big one. The money
you sand is arrove. Thank God foi\ Everybody
sand salams. God keep you from the big danger.
Good day.—'Your father.
* * * *
“Retired Lunatic”: For unconscious cal-
lousness you can’t beat a Government depart-
ment. A dray-driver at Canberra had to
spend a term in the Commission’s hospital.
When he came out he applied for the pay
due to him for work done previously-
£3 18s. He received a pay envelope con-
taining a contra account: £3 16s. hospital
expenses, two shillings rent —balance nil.
On the reverse side of the envelope somebody
had stampd the legend: “Your pocket pays
no interest, but the Commonwealth Savings
Bank does. Open an account now!”
* * * *
“V.D.L.” : The slogan craze has penetrated
to the sleepiest city in Australasia, and
Hobart is on its hind legs and crowing. The
local Development League (c/o the Mayor
Town Hall, Hobart) offers £2l for the best
slogan of 20 words or under. The sentence
must notice (1) Hobart’s wonderful natural
beauty; (2) its unsurpassable excellence as
a tourist resort; (3) the deepness of the
water in its harbor; (4) its splendid oppor-
tunities for investors as a manufacturing
centre. This seems quite a lot to tuck into
20 words, and I don’t think it can be done.
My entry is “Hobart Hopes.”
* * * *
“Bison” : Visible to passing tram pas-
sengers in the dingy main street of a Mel-
bourne suburb are two famous names —
Charles Dickens and Adam Smith. Charles
is a sewerage contractor, and Adam, though
doubtless an economist of sorts, is not a
political one. He is a moneylender, which
suggests that there ought to be a copyright
in names that go echoing down the ages.
Writer was once reporting in a W.A. police-
court when a man named Matthew Arnold
was fined five shillings for being drunk and
disorderly.
“L.C.”: life in the suburbs can still pro-
vide unexpected thrills. The usual speed
maniac knocked down and killed a pedestrian
the other day and left the scene in a desper-
ate hurry. A man who had seen what hap-
pened jumped on to the running-board of a
passing motor and told the driver to pursue.
The driver stepped on it without asking
questions and a grim night chase followed.
Through Malvern (Tie.) and into Camber-
well they went, but when the pursuers got
close enough to read the number on the
fugitive’s car they slowed down and left the
information at the nearest police-station.
The plucky driver of the pursuing car was
a girl, who declared afterwards she had
never hit it up so fast in her short career at
the wheel.
* * * *
“E. Mudliook”: Speaking of free-and-
easy police methods, I was once in a hotel
bar in a wiry Queensland township, when
a police constable, considerably “shot,” and
losing his temper over some fancied slight
on the part of the publican, started to
clean up the bar. Bung rang up the
sergeant, who, with the assistance of some
volunteers, soused ins subordinate under
the pump and then locked him up in a
chaffhouse at the back of the pub. Tb-
sergeant reckoned it was hardly worth while
going to bed again, so he got in at an all-
night game of poker. When dawn came
lie went to the shed, unlocked his confrere,
and the pair had a couple of stiff nips apiece
at the bar. Then they strolled back to the
police-station in the best of spirits, to
resume the work of maintaining law and
order.
* - * * *
“Balass”: Cabled that the British Nati-
onal Jewellers’ Association has taken the
opal off the list of birth-stones and substituted
the aquamarine. Australia and Hungary are
about the only two countries where the
opal is found, and as Australia has practi-
cally a monopoly of production nowadays, a
protest has been sent to the Imperial Govern-
ment. The aquamarine is a stone of bilious
and unconvincing appearance, and it lacks
the prestige of ancient superstition that
made the glowing opal the symbol of tin*
Old World’s autumn coloring, and assigned it
to October. Time was when it was accounted
an unlucky stone to all save those lucky
enough to be born in October, but the dis-
covery of the wonderful Australian black
opal broke down tire age-old antipathy. It
will take a stronger force than a jewellers’
association to displace the Australian gem
from Bs world-wide popularity.
“Cartot”: If there was
an older race in New
Guinea (B. 7/4/’27), it
is unlikely to have been
Malayan in origin ; much
more probably it was an
offshoot from one of the
migratory streams which
crossed the Pacific further
to the north, established
a temporary civilisation
in some of the great land-
masses there and built
flourishing cities in those
portions of which the
Carolines are now the
sole remnants. That sub-
sidiary streams did turn
southwards from the main
migrations is well estab-
lished by ethnological
evidence, but whether
they were swallowed up
by other peoples of a
lower type is uncertain.
In New Guinea they
would obviously have en-
countered a more primi-
tive race, which may have
assimilated them. The
later comers, who have
left so few traces, would
appear, from such scanty
evidence as has been dug
up in the islands further
to the north, to have come
originally from the Asian
stock which gave Europe
the Turks.
* *
“L.T.”: Christchurch
(M.E.) is a city that
prides itself on having a
traffic problem, and for
years it has taken that
problem very seriously.
All the footpaths are
divided by a white line,
and people who don't
keep to the left risk being-
hauled before the cadi
and bastinadoed. At street
intersections there is a
.regular orgy of painted
marks over which one
may not stray. But pain
has been caused by a
large sign that now ap-
pears on every corner:
“Pedestrians Cross Cross-
ing Here.” “Student of
English” and “English
Born” have been writing
indignantly to the papers
about such seeming lev-
ity, but the only satisfac-
tion they have received is
an official assurance that
the quaint diction lias
been deliberately designed
to attract attention to
the notices.
“Senojo”: Melbourne
hag a super-optimist. At
all events, a street letter-
box yielded up the other
night, along with its usual
freight, a telegram form
to which a note was pin-
ned. The note ran:
“Please find money on
top of the box.” It seem-
ed simple, but it couldn't
he done.
“Nakhoda”: De Pincdo's fine attempt to
belt the world was frustrated by a small
boy who threw a match into the "oily water
in which the Italian’s seaplane was floating
in the Roosevelt Dam, Arizona. Which re-
minds me that the same intrepid voyager's
flight to Australia and back nearly ended in
Farm Cove, Sydney. Two launch loads of
De Pinedo’s semi-delirious compatriots bore
down on his machine and nearly squeezed
it to death in the transports of their joy.
Hysterical mobs are horrible nightmares to
the pioneers of the air. When Cobliam
landed amongst the human mass in Mel-
bourne, I saw several men—and women, too
—with penknives in their hands, making for
the ’plane with the mad light of souvenir-
hunters in their eyes. Cobliam was so pleased
with his reception that all he could do was
to swear.

“H.E.C.”: In the Brisbane Museum is
preserved a portion of a tree which once
grew on Sweers Island, in the Gulf of
Carpentaria. It bears the following
inscriptions: “1781 Lowry’’ (this was a
Dutch exploring vessel) ; “1798,'’ followed by
some. Chinese characters; “1802, Investiga-
tor, Robert Devine” (the Investigator was
Matthew Flinders’s ship, and Devine was
first mate) : “1841 Stoke” (Captain Stoke,
in command of the Beagle) ; “385(5, Nor-
man (Captain Norman, of the \ictoria.

Gold buttercups have come again
Along the silenced, empty lane,
Brave Spring has decked it out in green,
And it forgets what it has seen :
The feet that all day marching up
Crushed down the gleaming buttercup;
And in the yellow of the grain,
A deeper, swifter-spreading stain.

“The Welkin”: Choom was a keen Avireless
enthusiast and had just finished erecting a
receiving apparatus which had absorbed almost
all his savings. He was full of enthusiasm
over his hobby and his purchase, and dis-
regarded the dangerous look in his em-
ployer’s eye as the latter denounced these
new-fangled contraptions as calculated to
take a man’s mind off his work. That night
Choom tuned-in and the first item that came
through the loud-speaker was: “Mr. Blank-

science will noAv deliver his third lecture on
The Way We Live.” Mr. Blankscience com-
menced his tonic talk. “This evening I wish
to speak of the value of Sleep. We moderns
do not have sufficient sleep.” This was the
last straw on the Cocky’s back, and that
same night a young Englishman encumbered
with a wireless set was driven to the nearest
railway station. Dad still insists that the
sleep talk was a put-up job by the Pommy to
obtain more than his legitimate allowance
of five hours’ slumber.

“Erua”: One of the problems that have
been exercising Maoriland social reformers
for years past is the future of the Maori
race. At present Ilona re lives a free-and-
easy existence, works when he pleases, never
goes short- of food, and drifts pleasantly
through life on excellent terms with' his
pakeha neighbors. But a meeting convened
in Hawkes Bay recently decided that the
time has come for the native to shoulder
the obligations of citizenship. and education.
The idea is that, after going through the
primary schools or the Maori colleges, he
should no longer be allowed to go back to the
kainga and lead a lazy and aimless life,
doing odd jobs on neighboring farms. Instead
he is to be equipped for a trade or profession
and made to take full advantage of the
facilities that are as fully open to him as
to the pakeha. That he has the ability to
keep abreast of the white man is never ques-
tioned. The chief obstacle to Henafe’s pro-
gress is a deep-rooted disinclination to exer-
tion of any kind, yet in the days of the great
tribal wars he was a person of wonderful
strategy and splendid achievement. Civilisa-
tion, removing the need for this, lias given
him no other incentive to action.
“Up Top”: Of all kinds of ill-temper, is
there any more insane than that which
leads a man to wreak his wrath on an
inanimate object? I’ve seen a man stub his
toe on the doorstep, then turn around and
kick the obstruction until he howled Avith
pain. Another temporary idiot, who had
clumsily stumbled over my billycan, booted
the dashed thing down the paddock until it
was only a shapeless mass of tin. A cobber
of mine flew off the handle because he. had
leaned his axe against the wall and the
blamed thing slid down. He bashed the
offending implement against the wall until
he’d smashed both. The same chap tripped
over a broom. He promptly snapped it: into
matchwood and then chased an interfering
dog with a crowbar. And I could toll of
a hundred other similar instances. But did
ever anyone see. a woman do anything
so silly, though Avoman is ordinarily the far
more emotional sex?

“FlagAvagger”: The ignorance of flags
shown by the average Australian is stupen-
dous. After my discharge from Caulfield
military hospital late in 3.918 I went to
Geelong and was invited, with a lady friend,
to a social evening
at the club-rooms
of the local R.S.A.
Among other parlor
games, a large
sheet containing
numbered and col-
ored representa-
tions of various
national flags was
hung on a wall, and
after being supplied
with blank cards
and pencils, the
guests were given a
limited time to
name the flags. In
pre-war days I had
made all kinds of
signalling a hobby,
and so had studied
the international
code and the flags
of all countries.
Consequently I had
no difficulty in lill-
ing my card, which
I naturally gave
to my fair com-
panion. She won
the prize and non-
chalantly accepted
the compliments
about her accurate
knowledge. Soon
after came news of
the Armistice, and
we Diggers were to
march through Gee-
long’s streets. On
the way to the
assembly place I
met the “winner”
of the flag competi-
tion, and she un-
rolled a large flag,
tied to a pole, for
my view. It was
a silk German flag,
three feet square.
Questioned, she said
that she had selected the largest of a number
of flags in a box belonging to a brother who
was an amateur conjurer. I took it from
the pole and hid it in my tunic.
* * * *
“Wongajong”: Even the humblest calling
has standards that must be maintained. The
garbage contractor in our small suburban
hamlet recently sacked the lad whom ho
employed to help him on his rounds. The
boy’s father felt himself aggrieved and, way-
laying the contractor, requested to be told
the reason for his son’s dismissal. Was he
dishonest, unpunctual or uncivil? The con-
tractor admitted that he was not. Was
there any fault to find Avith his treatment
of the horse? Another shake of the head.
“Then,” demanded dad, “why did you get
rid of my boy?” The garbage man scratched
his head. “The trouble was that he didn’t
seem to take no intelligent interest in the
emptyin’s.”
“Simon” : I am convinced that deaf mutes
liaA T e an extra but indefinable sense to make
up for the lost one. They rarely meet with
an accident; I have never heard of one
being run over in the street. One of them
who rode a bike told me he could “feel”
an approaching vehicle through the machine.
While fishing witli another he used to sense
a motor-car approaching along a road that
SAFETY FIRST.
“Only just back from the Talkalots! My, you stayed a long time!”
“I should think I did. And if you’d heard the things they said of everyone who left —
well, you wouldn’t have left till last, either.
was entirely hidden by the river’s bank. And
you will find they are all extraordinarily
light sleepers, and the faintest noise—or
what would be a noise to others—will awaken
them in an instant.
* * * *
“Birre Gurra”: Some of these pilferers
select strange hiding-places for their loot.
The other day on a western Queensland
station we were equipping a sub-artesian bore
with a deep pump, and had put the casing
down, but could not get the pump-rods to
descend in the casing. Sweat and profanity
having proved futile, we manned the winch
and hauled the casing up. In one of the
bottom lengths the obstruction was found.
It was a roll of Fuji silk.
* * * *
“Dugald Dalgetty”: The refusal of the
British F. O. to endorse the passports of
a lot of liard-up ex-officers who desired to
take service with the anti-Red Chinese forces
was inevitable. The Foreign Enlistment Act
forbids a British subject to raise forces
for service against a “friendly Power,” which
term would include the Government, even if it
were frankly Bolshevik, of any country with
which Britain is at peace. But the decent
hypocrisy which is the lodestar of our race,
and permitted such men as “K. of Iv.” to
practically desert, as a subaltern, and serve
with the French forces against the Hun in
1870, without troublesome protest, has again
come to the rescue. Passports have been
issued to the adventurers and endorsed “Not
valid for China.” They are, presumably,
good for any of the immediately adjoining
territories, so I expect to hear soon that the
mob has clicked with its Chinese friends.
“Noo Zee”: Even the Maltese dairyman
who patrols the streets and milks directly
into the customer’s jug as evidence of good
faith (B. 17/3/’27) has a trick or two in
his box. One of his devices is a small con-
tainer under his arm with a tiny rubber tube
running down his coat sleeve to his hand —
quite easily worked, too. I never fancied
Valetta milk myself; the Maltese goats are
in a class of their own as street scavengers.
They will clean a thoroughfare of cigar and
cigarette butts and peanut shells on their way
to milk delivery.

“Rob P.”: Ted was the camp’s chief
calamity howler; when he wasn’t incapaci-
tated by lumbago his corns Avere too painful
to be walked on. At last liis lamentations and
threats to “do away with himself” so fed up
the boss that he tried an old remedy.
'Rummaging among his dunnage he produced
a murderous-looking revolver, and pushing it
into Ted’s hands said: “Here! Get off down
into the creek bed and shoot yourself!” Ted
looked at the weapon, then at the boss, and
without a word sauntered towards the creek.
About a minute after he disappeared down
the bank we heard “bang,” followed by “bang-
bang,” and another “bang,” then silence. The
boss upended himself thoughtfully and started
for the scene at the double. “The blankard
has shot himself,” he yelled back from a
distance of 50 yards. From further off came
another voice : “You’re a liar. I’ve shot
somebody’s duck, but this lumbago’s so
bad I can’t get. it.”
* • * *
“Topee”: The old gentleman on the tram
was deploring the gambling propensities of
his grandsons. “Every blessed John Dunn they
can lay their fingers on,” he declared queru-
lously, “goes on the ponies.” The quaint, and
seldom heard nowadays, synonym for a pound
sent me back 50 years, when it. was a
common term of speech in Sydney. Similarly,
a “Newland” was the cant term for a Bank
of England fiver in my grand-dad’s days, am!
a quid-note became a “Bradbury” during the
war. All of these were the names of the
bank officials signing the various note-issues.
I fancy the original John Dunn was high
up in the Bank of N.S.W. in the ’seventies.
“Kerys” : Lord Roberts knew all about the
Indian habit of using shredded bamboo as a
poison (B. 30/3/27). In his book “Forty-
one Years in India” he tells of the illness
of his baby son, whose ayah was found to
be administering the vegetable finely chopped
to the infant, in revenge for having been
brought against her will from her home and
family to nurse the sahib’s child. The
Roberts baby lived long enough to earn the
V.C., though not to receive it.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Gladys, I cannot ask, I’m well aware,
For Avhorn you purpose a capillary snare
What time you brush and bind your golden
hair.
If I should put the question Horace did
To Pyrrlia—which I wouldn’t, Ileav'n for-
bid !—-
I might be justly told, “Cut out the kid!"
Because ’tis obvious you couldn’t find,
Atop your shapely head or eke behind,
A bit of hair that’s long enough to bind.
Now that your croAvning glory you discard,
To follow Horace is a trifle hard
For any classically-minded bard.
I wonder how. his query lie would frame
If back to earth (and flapperdom) he came
To find his Pyrrlia playing fashion’s game.
He might express mild wonder, I suppose,
For whose increased infatuation goes
That dab of powder on a dainty nose;
And ask to be enlightened who will sip
Or taste that cherry stuff her ladyship
Applies so deftly to a pouting lip;
And get —if Pyrrha were what Gladys is—
A pert assurance that, Avhoever’s biz.
It might or mightn’t be, it wasn’t his.

The WILD CAT
COLUMN
British Australian Wool Realisation
Association, Ltd., better known as Bawra: —
It has been a long and troublesome journey
to liquidation, but tlie goal is in sight. The
liquidators took over in June last, and, fol-
lowing the dismissal by the Privy Council
on March 2 of the Bardsley appeal in the
skin-wool case, they asked Justice Cussen
to authorise the trustees to hand over the
funds. They are hopeful that they will be
clear of all entanglements by May 5, when
they make their report to the general meet-
ing. As in the preceding year, the accounts
are little more than a statement of income
and expenditure, the last of the wool handled
by the co. having been sold in 1924. An
amount of £l5OO recovered in London in
settlement of claims for damaged wool is
an echo of Bawra’s final trading. Income,
for the 12 months totalled £333,227 —
£302,430 from investments; £l5OO from
the recovery mentioned; £27,990 balances
transferred; and £1307 sundry receipts.
Expenditure was mucli lighter. Administra-
tive exes, totalled £56,027 ; while £1926 was
deducted for depreciation on the co.’s
premises and £1262 for propitiation account.
The surplus for the 12 months was £274,012.
Although the date of the distribution of
funds is uncertain, the liquidators intend
to pay out as soon as possible. Six months
has been mentioned a,s the likely period.
Chief interest is in the amount per share
which will result. Liabilities at December 31
amounted to £46,502; £343,971 was set aside
for contingencies, including taxation,, “if
any,” and £30,198 for re-allocation account;,
but it is unlikely that either sum will be
demanded. Assets totalled £6,773,120, or
£6,686,618 net. Additional to that are the
trust funds, which amounted to £1,055,462.
Included in the funds are 692,403 Bawra
shares (542,470 being portion of the skin-wool
trust and 149,933 portion of the wool-selling
brokers’ commission trust) which appeared
at their face value, £34,620 3s. Issued
capital consisted of 11,848,041 shares at
Is. each. This means somewhere between
15s. 3d. and 15s. 6d. per share. But that
is the maximum as at December 31. It takes
in the entire sum provided for contingencies
and the re-allocation account, and includes
the trust funds at their full value. There
may be a little more; the association’s free-
hold, for instance, has been well written
down, and there is the interest on invest-
ments which already has accrued and which
will continue until the securities are
marketed, or, in the case of the money at
call, until it actually is distributed, less, of
course, current expenditure. These addi-
tions, however, will not be important. The
liquidators should encounter little difficulty
in the work of realisation :
British Government bonds, at cost . . £938,975
Australian stock, at cost . . . . . . 1,049,296
Sundry investments, including loans at. call 1,128,798

Current account .. .. .. .. 112,677
Sundry debtors .. .. .. .. 25,905
Freehold, at cost less depreciation .. 23,310
Cash on hand .. .. .. .. 39
There is one qualifying factor : the question
of taxation. State and Federal authorities
have been supplied with returns covering
the operations of the co. since it registered
in 1921, and they have endeavored to find
out the sums, if any, payable in Australia
by Bawra as a company. No decision had
been received up to the time of the report.
Following the Privy Council’s decision, the
shares lifted to 13s. A year ago there were
sales at 11s. lid.; latest transactions were
at 13s. lOd.

1927.. 57,553 10 ~ „ 40,000 10,000 7553 15,119
Despite the big capitalisation of two years
ago, the co. has continued its 10 p.c. divs.
without strain. Revenue last year after
providing for depreciation was £67,631 from
the business and £25.537 from rents, as
against £58,879 and £24.963 the previous
year. Expenditure was slightly greater, but
that includes a larger provision for repairs
and bad debts. Reserves look very small
compared with paid capital of £400,000. But
this Column isn’t prepared to swear that
the £.15,119 represents the only profits that
have not been distributed. There is, for
instance, an insurance reserve (£8790),
which went up £llBB in the 12 months.
There is also a sundry debtors reserve of
£6512, a reserve against advances of £17,424,
and .a freehold depreciation reserve of
£50,000. Though these are not included
with the reserves in the table, that they
contain true profits is suggested by the 1924
operations and supported by the fact of the
co.’s obvious prosperity. In 1924, for _ in-
stance, of the amount which was visibly
extracted for the gift issue, £12,887 came
from debtors’ reserve, £10,201 from advances
reserve, and £18,832 from freehold deprecia-
tion. The rest of it came from inside, and
the conjuring was not complete even at that,
because the co. repaid some debenture debt
out of a fund which could not be tracked
down in the accounts. Moreover, considering
the large amounts written off each year, it
is questionable whether depreciation has not
been otherwise provided for. A management
which could drag £89,377 into the daylight,
distribute £150.000 in bonus shares and con-
tinue the old div. rate is not likely to have
slipped into bad habits in the past 12 months.

Apparently Tooth’s, who were looking into
the possibilities of Broken Ilill now that the
through-railway is about finished, have come
to some arrangement with the S.A. Co.; at
any rate, the latter announces : “The supply-
ing of beer to Broken Ilill from Adelaide
has proved advantageous and will be con-
tinued” —the co.’s local brewery was closed
last year. In its middle days a wise man-
agement was careful to strengthen in every
way the co.’s position. For a run of years
to 1911, 5 p.c. p.a. was paid, and it was
not until 1914 that shareholders got 10 p.c.
With the exception of a break in 1917 and
1918 that rate has since been maintained,
plus the gift issue. Internal provision is
very essential in the case of a brewing co.,
for the contingencies it must provide against
are numerous. Here, however, the needs
are not nearly so pressing as those of brew T-
ing cos. in other States, for the substantial
capital sunk in wine-growing in South Aus-
tralia is a strong defence against the direct
assaults of the army of Cold Tea. But the
indirect assaults are pretty strong and con-
stant, and keep the trade in South Aus. as
respectable almost as the churches.

When the directors have checked up the
losses and are satisfied that normal condi-
tions prevail on the co.’s properties, they
intend to submit a scheme for writing down
the ordinary share capital. It is the only
solution. With £35,000 due to the prefs.
by the end of the current year and the co.’s
stations still in the throes of recovery, it
looks as if a substantial cut will have to
be made at the 600,000 £1 ordinaries. The
quarter-million of 7 p.c. prefs. will, of course,
be left alone.
Drought was the cause of the loss; drought
the like of which, it is declared, the Q.N.P.
had never before experienced. With 10 709
square miles to handle, results are likely
to run into big figures, one way or another.
Of recent years the co. has been turning
to sheep, and heavy expenditure has been
incurred —something up to £Bo,ooo—in con-
verting Cork and Lucknow, the first stop
being the erection of the best part of
300 miles of dog-proof fencing. That
money has not been lost, but the setback
was extremely unfortunate in that it kills
at a blow the progress made since the slump
of 1921. The severity of last year’s drought
can be realised wheD it is stated that only
6981 calves were branded and not a lamb
was marked, whereas brandings in the previ-
ous year numbered 28,578 and lambings
63,413. Nor is the doleful tale completed
with that recital: stock losses for the 12
months amounted to £175,000. This com-
parison shows the decrease in the value of
the herds

Fortunately, given a run of good seasons,
building up can be very rapid. Sheep-
growing offers the brighter prospects.
Divested of the support of the Imperial meat
contracts, Australian beef-exporting cos.
have had and will have a tough time. Apart
altogether from the advantages possessed by
the Argentine in the matter of nearness to
European markets, superior quality and
quicker maturing beasts, there is the support
and influence of Vestey’s in England and the
Meat Trust in America to guarantee the in-
side running to the Argentine product.
The accounts show that income fell from
£187,937 to £60,323, while expenditure, in-
cluding drought losses, was £265,758, as
against £146,073 for the previous term. Ina-
bilities increased, chiefly the bank overdraft,
which was £38,694 greater. For all that,
the position was not uncomfortable:—

Six consecutive lean years leave their mark.
And the best of management is helpless in
the face of weather which makes dusty tracks
of watercourses and a desert of home pad-
docks. Incidentally, the Q.N.P. should not
lack in efficient control: it is an offshoot
of the Q. N. Bank, the connection being indi-
cated by the board, which is composed of
three of its directors and its general man-
ager. Of the pile of properties left on the
bank’s hands after the crash of the ’nineties
the pastoral were subsequently floated off
into the Q.N.P.
The board had been cutting down cattle
values. Last year’s events show the wisdom
of the policy—and raise a query as to
whether the cuts have been sufficient. As
to that and the adequacy of the allowance
for amortisation and depreciation, the only
guidance is the personnel of the board. If
these allowances have been sufficient, then
the problem which faces the board is the
p. and 1. debit. And that is quite enough
in itself.

A smaller return from subsidiary companies
affected last year’s profits. That is a factor
which operates in the case of Amalgamated
Pictures to a variable degree, occasionally
to an extent that cuts the ordinary div. in
halves. The co. holds shares in General
Films (43,50 S £1 shares each in Union
Theatres and Australasian Films) ; and is
owed £15,700 by General Films (£11,700
in debentures) and £5332 by Union The-
atres ; but the lending of money to relations
doesn’t appear to be very profitable. The
comfortable-looking reserves need not be taken
seriously: when the combine was formed
and reams of paper were handed over to the
participating cos., Amalgamated blew the
froth into a capital realisation reserve “to
provide for any fluctuation in value of share-
holdings,” and this is included with _ the
reserves. Including the hot air, the position
is:—

written down to the present figure. The
co. owns also the Melbourne Majestic, a
leasehold on which it has spent over £34,000.
Its interests other than those in the combine
include three suburban shows. Union The-
atres runs the Majestic, Amalgamated col-
lecting the rent. Earnings and expenses

At February 28 the 12,000 10 p.c. prefs.
could see solid assets (£22,872 more or less
liquid) which, after allowing for the modest
liabilities and final divs., were equal to
£4 7s. lid. per share, with whatever the
combine paper and other picture interests
might be worth. There appear to be reason-
able chances now of the 10 p.c. divs. having
an uninterrupted run. The market considers
the ordinaries uncertain and there have been
sales at 21s. 6d. Apart from the shares in
picture cos. the co. has net assets for each
ordinary share as follows: —
Net physical assets (inc. debentures) .. £70,390
Less leasehold sinking fund .. £8,322
Pref. capital.. .. .. 12,000
20,322
£50,068
There are 60,710 ordinaries, so on their book
value the net physical assets are worth
16s. 6d. per share. What the shares in
other picture-show and film cos. are worth
it is hard to say. But they have been bring-
ing in an average of, say, £4OOO a year, and
they don't represent anything like £40,000
of the capital. Pref. and ord. share capital
together is only £72,710.

Broadbent Bros, and Co—a similar business
which covered western Victoria and the
Mallee —was acquired in 1925. The necessi-
ties of the growing trade last year impelled
the co. to call up the ss. outstanding on the
100,000 255. shares. There has been a robust
expansion during the last two years:—

Expenses arc moving upwards again, and
that needs watching. Book debts last year
increased by £20,750; and stocks by £11,439.
Provision lias been made for bad and doubt-
ful debts, but the amount owing is very
solid; and in of the fact that conditions
are in the main prosperous throughout the
territory in which Permowan Wright operate,
it would do no harm if the amount was
worked down and some of the outside debt
liquidated. The financial position, however,
is not uncomfortable :

The holding in Murray Shipping is in at
its face value. So far as other assets are
concerned the management is credited with
taking a conservative view of the position
at each balancing date. Thus the mounting
reserves may be accepted at their face value.
Recent sales were at 40s. od., and there seems
to be nothing extravagant about that. 4 lsible
net assets stand for 425.; and the earnings
have been well in excess of the 124 p.c. divi-
dend during the past four years. Prior to
that, however, results were rather erratic,
and it is quite conceivable that they will be
again. #

When Broken Hill started smelting it
used imported coke, and paid well over £4
a ton for it. The usual story was told—
Australia couldn’t make smelting coke; its
coal wouldn’t produce an article that would
stand up to the load. Of course it wasn’t
true, and presently, after buying thousands
of tons of other people’s Australian coke, the
B. 11. Prop, started to make its own —mostly
out of waste coal. No foreign coke came
in for years, but lately Germany lias again
pushed into the business, and it is alleged
that German coke has been landed in Aus-
tralia for 15s. per ton. The loading appli-
ances at Kembla, the principal shipping
centre, don’t help the local product; and
that’s a matter that needs looking into.
Flagstone (N.S.W.) holders were given
the comforting assurance on Monday that
the directors had authorised the issue of a
£2OOO debenture at call to one of their
number, the security being the mine and
plant. It had not been deemed necessary to
ask the assent of the shareholders or their
opinion even, although the annual meeting
was long overdue. Admissions by the chair-
man, too. indicate that the £2OOO was already
well eaten into when it was made available
by director Colin Caird. It seems quite
unlikely that the 4500 contribs. will pay the
ss. call that fell due on April 18, and in
that event Caird may foreclose whenever he
pleases and the mine may pass away from
those who have spent on it more than
£20,000.

Unlike most Westralian goldmining cos.,
Kanowna Red Hill, a Melbourne-controlled
concern, generally manages to produce a
gold yield in excess of what might be
expected from progress reports and assay
certificates. The co. has long been operating
the remnant of the quartz leader from which
Tom Doyle won sensational yields 30 years
ago. At times other small lenses of ore are
met and duly attended to. There is generally
a credit balance at the bank, a 6d. div. is
paid occasionally, and the last clean-up
resulted in 1740 z. being got from 200 tons.
Altogether the co. does well out of the limited
ore available.

Results from recent Government boring at
Coolgardie (W.A.) have been so encourag-
ing that hopes are again entertained of rais-
ing some of the old mines there from the
dead. But the job will not be easy. The
drawbacks to nearly all of these defunct
shows were narrow, rapidly-dipping, short-
lived shoots and hard ground.
W.A. State Miners’ Phthisis Act (pre-
mium, £4 10s. per cent, on wages paid)
operates all right in mining centres where
medical men are available to examine miners
with a view to granting the certificate neces-
sary under the Act. But no mining measure
has caused more inconvenience and bad
language in out-back mining camps. Anyone
in charge of a mine is liable to a fine of
£2O~ for employing a miner who does not
hold a certificate, even though he be as strong
as Hercules ; and a miner who works with-
out: a ticket is similarly liable. What hap-
pens is this. A miner without a ticket asks
employment at a point, say, 70 miles from
a doctor. The employer explains the provi-
sions of the Act, after which the miner says
he will see the Government to the Devil
before lie will do a double journey of 70 miles
to consult a medical man. The State Insur-
ance Office says the onus of getting the certi-
ficate is on the miner, but very few miners
seem to know that.
A few Westralian prosnectors are keeping
an eye out. for radio-active rocks ; but, judg-
ing by previous experience in Australia,
prospects are not encouraging. Some of the
best brains in Australia have been bestowed
on the problem of recovering radium from
radio-active ore, notablv in South Ans., so
far without profit.

The Development and Migration Com-
mission’s report on the Kalgoorlie gold-
mining industry is expected any time now.
It was hinted some months ago—and the
liint still looks good—that, while the com-
mittee was onoosed to a gold bonus, it
favored substantial assistance, provided the
mines on the held were amalgamated into
one or two groups and better management
was assured.
Some tall stories, with a stratum of truth
in most of them, are being told about tribu-
tors’ developments in one of the big mines
of the Golden Mile. One is to the effect
that one of the tribute parties, breaking lOoz.
ore, was told that it might show some respect
for the management, and the best way to
show it was to include some barren rock with
the ore in order to reduce the grade. Another:
The mine manager, after viewing a skip full
of 20oz. stuff, said to his underground boss,
“You never told me we had that below,
John.” A third: One party has a block of
6000 tons of ore exposed, the gold content
of which is estimated at £lOO,OOO.
Territory Tin is another little syndicate
encouraged by the high price of the metal to
try its luck under Australian conditions. The
co., with a capital of £1750 in £lO shares, is
to take over two prospecting licenses of
five square miles each on the ReynoldsJEtiver.
Promoters take 50 f.p. shares, and 85 have
been issued, while eight f.p. shares have been
issued to holders of contribs, and 32 held in
reserve. Directors are: 11. Wilson, C. J.
Reilly, ,T. F. Fyffe and H. S. Y. Busst, with
F. Tricks legal manager. A Melbourne co.
has taken an option over the northern por-
tion of each of the company’s two blocks.

Australian Radium Corporation, whose
mine is at Mount Painter, 70 mill's s.-e. of
old Farina, on tiro line to Oodnadatta (S.A.),
is in want of money. The works at Dry
Creek, near Adelaide, treated 17 tons of
concentrates for 50 milligrammes of radium
worth roughly £BOO. This result discouraged
the holders of 36,848 contributing shares,
who forfeited them for the first threepenny
call; and £27.000 is needed for road-making,
for a concentrating plant at the mine, for
development of leases near the present work-
ings, for additions to the Dry Creek plant
and for two motor-lorries. Dr. Bull, _ just
back from Europe, says the Mount Painter
deposits are second only to those at Katanga,
in the Belgian Congo, East Africa. He got
orders for radium abroad which could not
be filled through lack of development. It
has been decided to send Allan Bowler to
seek capital in London.
* * * *
Alan Davis has undertaken to float the
Thane G. M. Co., 25 acres in four leases
near Pratten, Warwick district (Q.). The
float has been relinquished by the Caird-
Aucher stable. The field has been worked
spasmodically since 1864. It was deserted in
1868, when Gympie began to attract atten-
tion. Miners who returned later had hardly
settled down when Stanthorpe tin deposits
lured them again. On one of the leases, the
St. Patrick, the first shaft was sunk in
1893, and this has been deepened to 180 ft.
by J. FI. Morris, the present owner and
vendor. Government records show that ISO
tons gave 3530 z. up to 1894, or just on 2oz.
to the ton of £3 13s. gold. Lonsdale Smith,
who reported on the prospects, says of the
St. Pat.:—
The country rock is the same as at Gympie, and
the lode is just entering the black slates, which in
Gympie have always carried payable gold. The
Underlie Shaft should be carried down to 300 ft.,
not only on account of the favorable geological
conditions, but because the lode carried gold in a
widening formation, and an increase in the length of
the lenses of ore may be confidently looked for in
the black slates.
The capital of the present co., intended to be
purely development, and without any vendor’s
shares attached, is £2OOO in 4000 10s. shares,
payable on allotment.

Titcomb and Goeffert completed their job
at Mt. Isa a couple of weeks back and
have come south. Cecil Davis preceded them
some time ago. Scripholders on the field
are holding tight, and this doubtless indicates
which way the wind is going to blow.
Although Titcomb did not throw any open
hints round, the Yankees have left the im-
pression that they think it a great deposit
and that quantities and grade bear out Cor-
bould’s data. Latterly, the experts had been
puzzling out the economic side—wages
hoard awards, overtime rate's, taxation and
freights; they needed an extra fortnight to
consider the incidence of these. On this
subject Frank Hambridge, one of the direc-
tors, provided them with a mainly historical
summary that some day ought to be worth
print.
* * * *
One of the best jobs Minister Alf Jones
has done for Queensland mining was to back
up the McClelland family at Stanhills with
a tin-crushing battery. North Q. has
waited for a year with great interest for
the verdict of the tables, on account of the
diversity of expert opinions on the field. The
stamps have been going the past couple of
months. The Mauretania crushing bulked
10 p.c. concentrates, roughly £lB a ton. So
far, about 200 tons of ore from the field,
including duffers on trial, have averaged
between £7 find £8 a ton. The results can
be considered more than satisfactory and go
a good way to .support tlie favorable opinions
expressed at various times by Jensen and
MiuesTnspector Williams. Concentrates are
high grade—something like 74 p.c. Seven
tons of concentrates have already been carted
to iCroydon and contributed to the general
optimism on the field, which has had a
weary wait for water.
Dr. Jensen has taken an option over a
500-acre block of alluvial in the Molloy dis-
trict (N.Q.) which his tests indicate will
go 41b. to Jib. of tin concentrates. A
number of holes have yet to be put down to
confirm these figures and bedrock is reckoned
to be 20ft. in places. The area is in the
same district as a couple of Fred Brown’s
alluvial boosts, which have yet to make good.
Although grey tin Occurs through this belt,
the concentrates are invariably dirty—too
much ilmenite and wolfram —and careful
dressing is necessary to catch a buyer. It
can be taken for granted that the vigilant
Jensen is keeping a keen eye on the class
as well as the quantity of concentrates forth-
coming. Alluvial tin in N.Q. needs only
one flaming success to set an old industry
going stronger than ever.
Misima G. M. Co., which took over B. H.
Block 10’s show at Misima Island, 126 miles
from Samarai (Papua), continues to do well
for the little bunch behind Gilbert Wilkin-
son, who is managing the show. For the
first 10 months of 1926 17s. per £1 share
was paid in divs., and as 3s. was paid in
1925 everything from now on will taste
sweet. The last word to the Wild Cat
from Wilkinson was that January produc-
tion of 1000 tons cleaned up 245. per ton
and Feb. gave promise of equal results.
Timber is a big item, and some of it has to be
hauled a long way. He states that all-over
costs have not averaged more than 17s.
sd. per ton of recent months. “This old
show is really wonderful,” he writes: “no
crushing, no machinery, no engine-drivers,
firewood, coal, etc.—just dump the ore into
the vats. We are now erecting another 50-
ton vat and hope to treat 1100 tons monthly
during 1927.”

Straits Tin, Limited, with a paid capital
of £25.000 in ss. shares and J. R. Peberdy
(late of Alluvial Tin) as managing director,
is getting into its stride. It has secured an
option over a large and promising area near
Taiping, which field is noted for its easy
dredging conditions and absence of the diffi-
culties so often connected with bucket
dredging. A few transactions have taken
place at 10s.

In spite of good returns, Pliin Soon, an
old Chinese open-cut show, with a compara-
tively shallow depth, is finding its overhead
too high. IT. V. Seale, field engineer, reports
that the cost of power distributed to several
working units on the area, plus the present
system of shifting the overburden, is too high.
Mechanical handling and a larger plant are
estimated to cost £23,916, and a pilot plant,
to cost £7583. will go into operation as soon
as possible. The. question of raising further
capital for the purpose is to be considered.
Phin’s 140,000 £1 shares, are f.p., and there
are sellers at 19s. 14 d.

“Old Warden”: Morobe Guinea Gold, one
of the Adelaide nibbles at the Bulolo field,
has published some particulars of a report
on the property, which is understood to be
on the Upper Edie. Field manager E. Miller
has reported the discovery of an “ore body”
in one of the leases. The Adelaide experts
think this indicates a dyke formation higher
up the Edie. It may be so, for the stony
specimen-gold of the Edie, and of the Bulolo
further down, undoubtedly gives evidence of
having come from some such formation. But
the stone is so rotten and the gold so worn
in specimens I have examined that a long
time must have elapsed since the parent
formation decomposed and spilt its frag-
ments down the valleys of the eastern
watershed. Those reefs and dykes may yet
be located, though the higher ground has
been prospected nearly to the top of that
particular watershed. I would be glad to
see my opinions refuted, but sounder data
than those offered so far must be produced
to make the, theory of their existence, accept-
able.

Malim Nawar South, one of the Pratten
interests in the Kinta V alley (F.M.S.),
seems at Last to he making headway with its
new-type dredge, around which such a storm
of discussion has raged among tin-experts and
near-experts. The dredge’s capacity to dig
to 80 feet was scouted by many who pro-
phesied capsizes and other disasters. It has
silenced criticism in that respect, having dug
with ease to 85ft., and its new jig and
classifier systems have apparently proved as
successful as anticipated. Last month’s
return was 50 tons of oxide from 154,000
cubic yards. For the first half of April tin-
figures are 30 tons from 85,000 yards; the
dredge’s estimated working capacity was
160,000 c.y. a month. The Larut combina-
tion, under the same banner, took out 146,000
yards for 52 tons for the fortnight, with,
presumably, the amalgamated co.’s four
dredges all going, since working hours are
given as 1039. Malim Nawar showed no im-
provement on last month, with nine tons
from 48,000 yards, while Kuala Kampar's five
tons from 28,000 yards could hardly have pro-
vided the real reason for tin l stock’s week-
end advance. Rawang, with dredge stopped
for general overhaul, had no returns to
report.
New Guinea Finance, Ltd., is the latest
addition to the long train of fortune-seekers
up that way. The co. has been registered
with a capital of £2500, in a hundred shares
of £25 each. This is to serve for financing
expeditions to New Guinea "to prospect for
minerals, precious stones, precious metals and
mining generally.” The amount asked for is
not excessive for the purpose, for New Guinea
prospecting is a tedious and expensive pro-
cess. If it is to include the purchase of
options, etc., it may prove inadequate, for
N.G. options are apt to he as expensive as
prospecting and, in most cases, just as much
of a gamble. The first directors are H. W.
Moore (chairman), It. A. Venables and H.
C. Nicholson.
* * * *
.Tigs and classifiers, till recently looked at
askance by old-time Malayan tin dredgers,
are now in fashion. Bidor Tin has resolved
on an up-to-the-minute bucket-dredge with
a digging capacity of 180,000 cubic yards a
month, driven by electricity and furnished
with the gadgets above mentioned. When the
big craft is afloat, the Malim Nawar South
dredge, with its mere 160,000 ft. capacity,
.can take a back seat.

Bob Young. G.O.C. of the Maoriland mili-
tary forces, is the son of an English parson
and saw the watery sun of the Old Dart for
the first time half a century ago. He was
apprenticed to the tootli-pulling industry and
became a fully qualified gum-digger, but didn’t
stick. When the Big Row broke out he had
years of volunteering to fall back on. and
sailed as a major. Gallipoli left him a
colonel, and he was a brigadier-general before
Major-General R. YOUNG, C. B., G.O.C.
Maoriland Military Forces.
most people were aware that the war had
some staying power. Returning to Fern-
land he became boss of the South Island
command and an honorary A.D.C. to Jellicoe,
and the final step was easy after Major-
General Melvill’s retirement. He loves soldier-
ing and believes that the job of a commanding
officer is to command.
The defeat of Matt Baird (Ballarat) and
Eggleston (St. Kilda) reduces the number
of lawyers in Vie. Assembly to four —Law-
son, Snowball, Blackburn and Slater. Black-
burn has practised as a barrister, but is
now a solicitor; the other three are also
solicitors. Time was when there were as
many as 16 Costs-cliasers in the House at
the one time—Higgins and Isaacs (now on
the High Court Bench), Irvine (State C..T.),
Deakin, Moule (now a Judge in Insolvency),
Turner, Best, Theodore Fink, Frank Mad-
den, Shi els and O’Loghlen among them. In
Turner’s first Cabinet there were five lawyers
—Turner, Isaacs, Duffy. Best and Cuthbert.
Cohen, who is a barrister, has no legal com-
pany in to-day’s 1 louse of Landlords.
Edmund Alfred Drake-Brockman, the new
Judge of the Commonwealth Arbitration
('ou'rt, was a Perth lawyer before he
went away as a major with the lltli
Battalion in 1914. He climbed to
command of the 16th Battalion in 1916
and was Brigadier-General of the 4tli Brigade
when the bugles blew for the Armistice.
Returning, he became one of the Westralian
Senators and a close friend of Bruce, whom
lie obliged by resigning his Senatorship ii
1925 to let Pearce get back and secure Cock; i
support for the Nationalists. The Prim |
Minister sent his chum to the League <■ !
Nations Assembly at Geneva and appoime
him stage-manager of the Referendum shov,
last year. Drake-Brockman deserves well of
the Nationalists; whether their grfttitulo
should take the form of a seat on the Arbi-
tration Bench is another matter.
Chaplain-Captain James Wilson, who died
in Sydney last week, was practically a war
victim. Wilson had two looks at the war
as a padre. After the first, in 1915. he
lectured in Australia on behalf of recruiting
and the Belgian Relief Fund. Going back, lie
stayed at bis job as chaplain until lie bad to
be carried out of France. As nominee of
the Petersham branch of the Soldiers and
Citizens’ Political Federation, he became a
Ma State Assemblyman, but a breakdown
came on top of the ill health that followed
him from France, and his political career
was brief. He died at 62.
The late Earl of Darnley, whom Australia
knew as Ivo Bligh, had many Diggers for
guests at Cobham Hall, Kent, during the war,
and convalescing Americans stayed there, too.
The family fortunes of the fine old cricketer
haven't been very bright of late years; while
one of his two boys actually went into the
city to earn his living, the grand baronial hall
was let to one of the new-rich. Lady Darn-
ley used to be Florence Morphy, of Beech-
worth (Vic.).
Leslie Joubert, who returned to the Bulolo
goldfield last week, is one of the few
remnants of the old brigade of Papuan
prospector-trader-recruiters. One of a well-
known Sydney clan, Joubert went to British
New Guinea, as it then was, nearly 30 years
ago; since then he has seen every corner of
it in every capacity, save as Government
official or missionary. A period with the
military in Rabaul, followed by a long spell
in the plantations department, ended when
he joined Frank Pryke, one of the famous
prospecting brothers, in a claim on Edie
Creek. A holiday in Sydney followed on a
successful clean-up, till the charms of sluice-
box and tail-race again proved too strong
to be resisted.
Australia’s representatives at the Economic
Conference at Geneva will be David Gordon,
S. Aus. M.L.C., Warren Kerr, and A. F. Bell.
Kerr is the Melbourne insurance broker who
was chairman of the Commonwealth War
Savings Council and many other organisa-
tions formed on the financial side of war
effort. Gordon was M.11.R. for Bootliby
from 1911 to 1913, and later became leader
of the Liberals in the S.A. Upper House.
He won a reputation as a financial expert
whilst commercial editor of the Register,
and with pen and tongue he was of immense
service to the Libs, at the recent State elec-
tion. David’s two sons went to the war,
and his daughter served as a nurse. Kerr
lost a son at Gallipoli. Bell is a terrific
worker, who is g.m. of Robert Harper and
Co., Ltd., and unpaid head of the Dried
Fruits Board.
The Speck’s A.L.P. conference, held at
Hobart, was chaired, for the first time since
1903, by a temporary hand, President
McDonald, of the A.W.U., being detained at
Zeehan by a little job-control dispute at the
electrolytic smelters. George Becker, one of
the Lyons Cabinet’s honoraries, took the
place of the absent McDonald, and did the
job to such satisfaction that conference
elected him president for the ensuing year.
McDonald was not a candidate.
Of the 50 delegates who attended the Tas.
Labor Conference six were women,
two of them wives of Ministers, and one of
them the most cultured speaker and perhaps
the brightest debater of the gathering. Mrs.
Anderson, the breezy West Coast dame who
has represented the mining district of
Queenstown at every annual A.L.P. confer-
ence for the past 15 years (she declares she
is 67 and still going strong), was this year
elected to a seat on the executive committee.
Burnett Gray, the Digger Mayor of St.
Kilda, whose defeat of Attorney-General
Eggleston was the greatest shock admini-
stered to the Allancoeks at the \ ic. election,
will be remembered by old Bulletin readers
for his “Bards of Beer.” He is a great
barracker for Australian literature, and in
earlier days wrote many a spirited lay.
T. F. Bride, who got the call aloft last
week, was formerly chief librarian at Melb.
Rcar-Admiral
NAPIER, first
Naval member of
the Board which
worems Australia's
little f[?]t.
Public Library. He
left that job to be-
come curator o f
intestate estates
and retired from the
State service I'J
years ago. After
graduating: at Mel-
bourne Uni. as
LL.D. be was for
a while librarian at
the “shop.” Prom
that to the Public
Library was but a
step. He served
for years on the
Uni. Council and
the Council of the
Mel b. Technical
School. Altogether
a first-rate citizen,
who had something
to show for his 78
years.
Downward, Vic. Minister for Lands, just
re-elected at 80 for Mornington. is a hard
man to discourage. lie first tried his hand
as a candidate for that constituency at
the famous election on May 11, 1877: he
was then beaten by J. L. Purves, afterwards
leader of Vic. Bar. Downward was unsuc-
cessful in ’B3, ’B9 and ’92, but won in ’94,
and has held the seat since.
There were few regrets in Vic. political
circles at the defeat of Attorney-General
Eggleston. He seemed to he constantly sym-
pathising with himself for having to mix
with such a poor lot as he found in Parlia-
ment, and the electors, who also failed to
make friends with him. relieved him of tin;
strain. On the other hand, the joy of vic-
tory of many old members was discounted
by the displacement of genial Sam Barnes.
ex-Minister for Mines and Railways. Sam
wanted to get out quietly, like Gordon, but
was persuaded to carry the Nash banner in
Walhalla again, only to find it had become
a hopeless proposition. Dave Oman, who
ran the compulsory wheat pool during the
last year of the war and two years after-
wards, was considered to be impregnable in
Hampden, hut he went down before Digger
Arthur Hughes. Hughes’s first intention
was to go for Warrnambool, but he was
edged out in favor of Bailey. Now, being
an ex-schoolmaster, he will want to be Min-
ister of Education in the Labor Govern-
ment.
On a long-existing understanding that he
was to have the next “safe” Federal seat,
the N.S.W. Nat. Federation is running Arch-
dale Parkhill for Warringah. But Scott
Fell has to be reckoned with yet, to say
nothing of the electors. Parkhill, formerly an
accountant, became first secretary of the
Reform Association, which, as party labels
changed, was transmogrified into the Nation-
alist Association; and he has been the
Nashers’ campaign organiser for all their big
election fights. He “sacrificed” himself in
North Sydney for W. M. Hughes.
At Ipswich (Q.) Albert York spied a
Lucknow Medal with one clasp attached to
the bosom of David Featherly, who was with
the Cameron Highlanders. He came to Aus-
tralia 60 years ago and wears his 91 years
easily.
As a young man in London George Henry
Bond knew Charles Dickens, and he cher-
ished the novelist’s memory throughout his
long life, which ended at Wentworthville
(N.S.W.) the other day. Bond spent many
years in America, and came to N. S. Wales
14 years ago to join two of his six sons —the
two who established the factory where
Ermyntrude’s stockings are fashioned. He
lived to see them pioneer the cotton-spinning
industry in Australia.
George Wilkins, the South Australian
who led an expedition to fly to the North
Pole and who has been missing since March
29, used to say that he could find food in
the polar zone to keep him for months. He
has now had an excellent chance to prove
it. He went on a preliminary flight from
Fort Barrow, and had to make a forced
landing on an ice-field, and the lastj«adio
messages he was able to send redded
failure to restart the frozen engine of his
’plane. Wilkins will be 39 next October.
When only 23 he butted into a Balkan war
as newspaper correspondent with Turkish
troops, and took an amazing series of actual
battle photographs; since then his life has
been a chain of adventures. A job with
the Stefansson Arctic expedition ; experiences
as flying officer and official photographer in
the Big Scrap—he got pictures that are
worth a Y.C.; a flight from England to
Australia, and two forays into the Antarctic
are finks leading up to the latest adventure.
No practitioner in Australia had a more
engaging bedside manner than had Thomas
Fiaschi, and few had a more adventurous
career. Son of an Italian professor, Dr.
Fiaschi came to Australia nearly half a
century ago, but dashed out again to help
Italy against the Abyssinians. When the
S African War came along he commanded
the N.S.W. No. 1 Field Hospital; and in
the Big War he looked after the No. .'»
Australian General Hospital until the hard
work broke his health. When he got fit
again lie plunged once more into war ser-
vice—this time with, the Italian army on
the Trentino front. A skilful surgeon, his
treatment of gastric ulcer made him notable
in his profession. The doctor's hobby was
viticulture, and he never ceased to believe
that Australia was fitted by its climate to
be a wine-drinking country. He owned the
Tizzana and Mudgee vineyards, and was for
years president of the N.S.W. Wine Associa-
tion.
Just dead Mrs. Ann Maria Fitzgerald,
who was the first white child born in Wil-
liamstown (Vic.), made a big stir when site
arrived. To the general rejoicing that fol-
lowed her birth. King Benbow and his
tribe contributed a eorroboree, hurrying from
their camp 15 miles distant for the purpose.
As the white piccaninny, held in the arms
of its father, was shown to them, the blacks
grew wildly excited. Mrs. Fitzgerald stayed
on in Wiiliamstown. where she spent the
whole of her 86 years—and most of the
time she lived in one house.
Although space is so cramped in the Can-
berra Parliament House that thousands who
think they have a right to be present are
sore about their exclusion, a place has been
found for John Gale, of Queanbeyan. At 07
he still looks after his paper, the Queanbeyan
Age, acts as district coroner, and is the
holder of other public offices. But his special
claim to be present is that he is writing a
book on “A Hundred Years of Canberra."
and has personal knowledge of most of them.

tured the Kew seat in Vie. Assembly, owe?

less Reynolds, the selected Nationalist, who
got only 119. Hughes’s gratitude is hardly
likely to make him a joint in the Assomblj»

for the Nash selectors who turned him down.
GALLIPOLI WEEDS.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The flowers that star Gallipoli
Beneath the springtime blue
Are little weeds from warfare free
Of every rainbow hue.
Above the death that was the doom
Of gallant youths who fell,
Now riot all the golden bloom
And Heaven’s asphodel.
Anemones and shy wild-thyme
Among the grasses stir.
And all that bleak and bitter clime
Is lit with lavender.
The heather clothes the steep hillsides
Down to the blue sea s brink,
And that war-stricken soil provides
* A purple robe and pink.
The wild convolvulus o’er-runs
The ruins of that spot
Where lonely lie our splendid sons
For ever unforgot;
The yellow mustard-flowers spread
Their dust of burnished gold,
And, rioting above the dead.
Are poppies brave and bold.
And redder may they seem to be
Because of that rich flood
Of Youth that gave so gallantly
Their benison of blood.
The flowers like a requiem
Re-clothe that region wrecked;
And we shall still remember them
In loveliness bedecked.
Old Nature mourning yearly heaps
That stricken land with hue;
That army in its glory sleeps
'Neath rosemary and rue.
And though with gifts of Spring bespread
That through the valleys roam.
Ilow lonely, lonely, are our dead—
1-low far, how far, from home!

COMPARISON LEADS YOU TO
CHRYSLER “50"
Compared with the other cars of large production in
the four-cylinder field, it is exceedingly easy to recog-
nize the outstanding values of the Chrysler “50” and
decide which car to buy.
In point of comfort and roominess, beauty of design,
beauty of finish, power, long life and economy, the
Chrysler “50” stands out unmistakably as the greatest
offering ever made in four-cylinder cars.
At last it is possible for you to make a convincing and con-
clusive comparison of values and satisfy yourself almost
at a glance in which car you should invest your money.
Chrysler Standardised Quality is a fixed and inflexible
quality standard which enforces the same scrupulously
close limits — the same rigid rule of engineering ex-
actness—the same absolute accuracy and precision of
alignment and assemblage—in the measurement,
the machining and manufacturing of every part,
practice and process in four lines of Chrysler cars*

ABORIGINALITIES
“Jimmy Possum” : Has any Abo.-ite tried
jil of turpentine for a fish-spike wound?
Yarning to an old fisherman, I was told
that whenever he went out with the net
or the lines lie carried a bottle of turps,
lie declared that one day, when a large
stingray got home on his leg with its four-
inch barbed spike, he was hopping around
as chirpy as ever in less than five minutes
after dressing the wound with turpentine.
As I have never had occasion to use the
“cure,” I cannot vouch for its efficacy; but
the old boy, who had been a sailor, swore
by it.
* * * *
“Woolly B.”: The six-inch liver-colored
earthworm disguises his presence when mak-
ing a long overland journey. Noticing a
faint, sinuous movement on a stretch of
loose, yellow-red loam, I focussed on it and
discovered Mr. Worm on the go. Fine par-
ticles and dust of the same earth material
were sticking evenly to the whole of his
body. Traversing about eight feet he came
to a patch of sand, where he halted. Pre-
sently he moved off again, this time along
the fringe of the sand patch; but a few feet
of this soon convinced the traveller that
he’d have to forsake the loam if he wished
to proceed in the direction he desired. Con-
tortions of his body at once took place and
he tied and untied his length in about half
a dozen different knots, each twist rubbing
off some of his soil coating. Then clean
as a whistle he gave himself the roll-over
in sand, and dressed in his new disguise,
streaked out for pastures new.
* * * *
“Centre” : Is there any limit to the depth
the earthworm penetrates below the surface?
While sinking a well through the hardest
and driest yellow clay I’ve ever had the
misfortune to meet, I recently found worms
as far down as 18 feet. They were blunt-
ended fore and aft, and dry as the soil they
were living in. There were no burrows or
holes to show whence they had come, nor any
indication that they had ever moved from
where I found them. They were quite dry,
even their internal arrangements showing
little moisture when I squashed one or two
to investigate.
* * * *
“Claude Western”: The Queensland gro-
per is probably the _ largest of the teleosts
in existence, excepting the swordfish. _ It
reaches a length of over six feet and weighs
fully three cwt. A Persian Gulf example
is, however, reported to have attained the
phenomenal size of 12 feet! Like the large
cod it becomes coarse and unpalatable with
increased size, but fish up to 301 b. or 401 b.
are excellent. Those who only know the
groper in its adult state as a coarse-looking,
dirty-brown object, all head and stomach,
would be astonished if shown the young fish
of a foot and under; it is a perfect glory
of blue and gold. # #
“Baomata”: The Rowley shoals and the
reefs lying off the Westralian coast are
richer in the materials of romance than
either the Barrier Reef or Torres Strait
(B. 24/3/’27). The Rowleys are a group of
coral atolls parallel to and distant from the
coast about 150 miles; they extend in a
chain over a length of 400 miles. The old
East Indiaman bound for Macassar Straits
or the Spice Islands did not have to be very
far eastward of his course before being in
danger of running upon one of these reefs.
The lead gives no warning of their vicinity,
as they rise to the surface sheer from a
depth of a hundred fathoms. They are fre-

quented by trepang fishers only, who are
constantly finding old brass cannon, anchors
and other relics of bygone shipping. On
the sandy islet in the lagoon of Imperieuse
Reef, the most southerly atoll, once lay the
wreck of a vessel of about 500 tons. Built
of oak, 6he was of very ancient pattern. The
portion of the hull buried in the sand was in
a perfect state of preservation. Industrious
trepang fishers still make search for treasure
that so far has not come to light. British
and Dutch, Spaniard, Portuguese and Arab
navigators left their relics on these reefs. It
is rare to find coins of any kind, but oid
weapons are frequently retrieved. The
natives of the south coast of Timor have
many tales of mysterious foreigners, who in
early days arrived from the sea in small
boats. Such adventurers could have come
only from wrecks on the Rowley shoals, and
they have left more enduring traces than
ancient weapons among the inhabitants of
some of the smaller islands.

“Sawbones”: My experience bears out
wliat “Larrapinta” (B. 24/2/’27) . says
about Barcoo rot. Practising in a district
which is developing into a wheat-growing
area, I meet the disease frequently. It occurs
chiefly among men who go out to their blocks
and batch. Their food is necessarily rough
—corned-beef, damper, and tinned stuff for
the greater part —and it is deficient in vita-
mines. “Larrapinta’s” dietary supplies this
deficiency, and, in my opinion, has been the
cause of his freedom from the troublesome
scourge.
* * * *
“Trapper” : I had been listening to a reci-
tal of the feats of a rabbiter’s dog, but
somewhat doubted them; so one night I
walked to the camp just as the trapper was
starting on his rounds. Pinch commenced at a
trap which was unsprung and rabbitless. The
next trap held a bunny, and while it was
being reset Pinch stood by until all was
ready; then he trotted to the third trap,
where he stood as we inspected it. The 60
traps were all found without the slightest
hesitation, and in very, thickly timbered
country. When the last number was reached
I thought Pinch would not know the fact,
but on his boss trying to send him further
on the old fellow stood still and looked at
him as much as to say “You can’t bluff me.”
Once he sees a trap set lie will go back to it
even a week after. Money could not buy
the dog, as he saves his master hours a day.
He is a cross between a sheep-dog and a
cattle-dog.
“Country Ped.”: Much damage is done
during the summer months to roads and irri-
gated properties in irrigation districts
by the yabbie or freshwater crayfish. The
little crustacean starts a circular hole in the
soft mud at the bottom of a channel. Work-
ing day and night, he goes under the ground
about two feet deep as far as he pleases,
until he completes an abiding place at the
end something after the shape of a U tube.
As often as not the holes make trouble;
water comes down out of the channel with
an ever-increasing flow until the roadway
or some paddock is flooded. The ibis is the
yabbie’s greatest enemy, _ and should be a
welcome guest on every irrigation farm.
* * * *
“Crosshead”: Has any Abo. tried to elec-
trocute a rat, using ordinary voltages? I
tried the other day to end the career of a
healthy specimen trapped in a cage, but lie
merely got lively with 200 volts, and though
550 burnt holes in his flesh he was still
active after several thorough applications.
An electrician was killed with the same volt-
age a few days later. I have seen f a rat
perfectly carbonised after causing a short
across the high-tension fuses (ll,000v.), but
although they gnawed through insulation and
caused endless bother on 440- and 000-volt
lines I have never known one to pass out
from exposure to such voltages.
“Riverin a“: In no Australian book have
I seen a reference to the deadly native saveloy
nor, as far as I know, does any museum
house one. Yet up to about 60 years ago
the weapon was used by the powerful Yarra-
munga tribe of the Speewaa country, -v
very old drover who claimed to know that
part well told me about it. In shape and
flight it resembled its diminutive relative,
the boomerang, but it was a colossus.
Measuring at least 50 feet from tip to tip, u
required 12 trained men to throw it. in
hunting or tribal warfare its possession made
the Yarramungas supreme—especially as
lesser tribes were forbidden its use. When
properly thrown its circuit was over a mne,
and as many as 50 kangaroos or enemies
fell at one 'sweep, the keen cutting ««-
halving the victims as a knife cleaves butter.
The saveloy was finally discarded when,
owing to a miscalculation, one returned un
expectedly to camp and annihilated a iai»
portion of the tribe, including the witch-
doctor, the chief corroboree librettist and
several politicians. Thereafter even
was taboo. This probably accounts for th
general lack of knowledge on the subject

BURIED IN THE BEND.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
There’s a queer old bend in the Flinders
stream
And a pub stood there in the days gone by,
And the station crowd and the swagmen loud
Would pull up there, for the road was dry;
And some went on and some they stayed
And some they stuck as the cheques would
fade,
And through the night you’d hear a song
That lifted up in the gidya throng:
“Oh, it’s here we’ll rest till the fun’s at an
end, _
And we’ll all get buried by the Beggar m
the Bend!
We’ll all get buried,” etc.!
The chap in the Bend was a fine old host:
His bar was famed—and his graveyard,
to<_.;
He turned none back, he was wont to boast,
And many stayed—till their toes went
blue; , .
His drink was built of the lightning brand
That flashed out joy in a hot young land,
He welcomed all with a cheque to spare,
For them with none he’d a sandridge bare.
And there they’d toss as the booze would
blend .
And sing, “We’re buried by the Beggar m the
Bend —
We’ll all get buried,” etc.
’Twas a motley crowd that the years have
sped,
The bright young hope and the broken
hack,
The man who’d washed in the Turon bed,
The lordly sprig of the days ’way back;
The host had a word for the whole queer crew
(He’d loads of sense —gi’e the De’il his due) ;
And when they’d drop in a drunken swoon
He’d lay them under the shining moon,
And the song would rise, like a tuneful friend,
“We’ll all get buried by the Beggar in the
Bend —
We’ll all get buried,” etc.
HE KNEW HE'D SUNK ’EM STRAIGHT.
“Do you call this a fence! It's as crooked as a dog’s hind-leg ?”
“Mine tinkit plurry post-'oles shifted, Boss.”
The sun would scorch on the burning plain
And die full red as the day went down;
The dust would whirl like a fiend insane,
But hope would rise as the pub grew
brown ;
There was witchcraft there and her name
was Rum,
With life for the dead and speech for the
dumb;
And if himself had had horns and a tail
You’d shake his fist with a “Comrade, hail!’
You’d sing “Hooray! For the prospects mend
And, as long as we’ve got a bob to spend,
We’ll take our luck as the Lord may send,
And when hard cash has come to an end
We’ll all get buried by the Beggar in the
Bend.”

“Wandi”: A useful Australian that is not
much heard of is the myrmecohius, or banded
ant-eater, a graceful and active little
creature with long ears and a long, bushy
tail-—somewhat like a squirrel when running
about. The upper part of the body is reddish,
darkening towards the tail, crossed with
white hands, and the under surface light
yellow. It. is diurnal in habit, retiring at
night into a hollow log or a hole in the
ground, where it also breeds, producing half
a dozen or more young ones at a time. Armed
with strong digging claws, it makes short
work of opening up an ants’ nest, and licks
up the swarming inmates in the manner of
the echidna. When in a hurry it leaps along
the ground at a fair pace, and, like the
kangaroo family, sits up on its hind legs
when at rest or taking observations.

mon to find turtles miles away from water

even in midsummer. One day I met a pro-
cession two miles from the river near Woram
(N.S.W.), making for a big lagoon a mile
farther on. There was a long gap between
some of them, but all were following the
leader’s tracks, and though there was a wide
patch of foxtail grass, three feet high, to go
through, they were going direct as if travel-
ling by compass. I asked an old black-
fellow. who was joyfully collecting some of
them, the reason of the emigration. “Big
feller flood come up soon,” he replied. A
week afterwards the river was running a
banker.
A GOOD SHOT.
“Met with a naccident, Joe?"
“No, wasn't a naccident —the wife meant it for me.”
“Gouger” : A luxury found on the Barrier
Ileef is the sea crayfish. Not as large as,
but similar in shape to, the lobster, he car-
ries beneath his spiky coat a plentiful supply
of meat. Colonies feed on the marine vege-
tation of these tide-
washed reefs. Gaz-
ing down at the
Jacob’ s-coat of
queer growths,
practised eyes will
see delicate tendrils
of brown, waving
inquisitively. Some
of these tendrils
meet at a base,
which is really the
crayfish’s li e a d.
Should something-
scare him, he with-
draws in a flash
to the shelter of the
corals. One stroke
of his lobster-like
tail propels him.
At low tide the
natives in dinghies
capture the Cray
with a four-pronged
spear; at high tide
they dive, spear in
hand, and search
him out amongst
the crannies in the
coral. Under water
a man may get
quite close and miss
them till he is star-
ing into their
"eyes.” These eyes
tip two of their
long feelers and,
magnified by the
water, glint like
chips of glass.
Once speared, the
long prongs must
be pressed right
through the fish’s
body, otherwise,
when lifting the
spear it needs only
one back-fire from
the strong tail to
set the cray free.
The experienced fisher is careful not to
grasp the body, for when his captive kicks
in protest Ins horny spikes are capable of
stripping the skin from the hand,

“Momokeni”: When a Papuan wishes to
honor a friend he names a pig after him, and
offers him the choicest morsels from his
namesake when pig-killing time comes round,
The native pig is usually a black, skinny,
long-snouted brute, so that when my white
Yorkshire sow, scaling over 2001 b., had a
litter, the natives thronged round the sty
and cast envious eyes on the “little white pigs
with no noses.” Being pestered incessantly to
bestow names on them—each man hoping to
be distinguished at the christening—l looked
to The Bulletin to help me out and thus
avoid invidious distinctions. That was three
years ago. Last mail I heard that “Pos-
Ponkit” (“Percy Pawnticket”) had gladdened
the hearts of the village folk with several
families, whilst “Henry Horsecollar” had
travelled 350 miles up the coast to Buna Bay
to increase the pig population there.
“Morice” ; I agree with “Jim Carew” (B.
3/2/’27) about jew-lizard on the menu.
Young goannas and frilled-lizards are also
tasty additions to the larder. My prefer-
ence is for a young lizzie stuffed, and roasted
in a camp-oven, with lashings of thick brown
gravy, and served with baked potatoes and
pumpkin. It is a dish for a duke.
“Wingella”: In the N.T. if is quite a
common occurrence for blacks to eat their
new-born babies. The custom is associated
with good luck, and it is the father who
invariably decides whether the babe shall
have a chance of
life or not. On one
occasion a lubra
was most insistent
that the white men
should leave one
particular locality
for a while, as a
half-caste child was
expected to be born
shortly, and her
tribe was “hungry-
feller longa little-
feller piccaninny.”
“Him only half-
caste,” she assured
me, eagerly; “him
no more white man,
no more black man,
him no more any-
sing half-caste!
More better tribe
eatum!” But the
white people did not
go away, and the
half-caste live d,
and now attends
school at the Dar-
win compound.
Once the word went
forth that the child was to live he was cared
for most scrupulously by all the tribe.
“Ivriz” : I know of several cases in Broome
(W A.) where pearls have been accidentally
found in pearl-blisters (B. 10/3/’27).
Pearlers use broken shell as top-dressing on
paths leading to their houses. A visitor
one day picked up a scraggy blister, which,
when opened, produced a small pearl valued
by the owner of the path at £25. In another
case an extra-large pair of pearl shells doing-
duty in a passage way to keep the front and
back doors open had been lying there un-
lieeded for years.. Coming through the pas-
sage in a hurry one day the pearler's son
sent one of the shells flying. It broke,
revealing what looked like a mud pearl
embedded in the broken part. After chip-
ping and cleaning, a pearl worth £750 was
taken out and sold to a French dealer. I
had myself a similar experience. Lying in
a drawer among other baroque was a pearl
blister which I had kept because it was
chipped out of a shell shaped like a woman’s
head. Broken tip later, I got £lB for the
small pearl inside.
“Black Tracker” : In the many references
to Australian bird-nest builders I have come
across I do not remember mention being
made of the musk-duck’s home. It differs
from all others, for the entrance to it is
at the bottom and below water. To a casual
observer it suggests a heap of weeds gathered
into the shape of a mound. On top of this
roosts the drake, keeping watch. At a sign
of danger a smack with the wings warns his
lady love, and she hastily appears from
below. If the mound be opened it will be
found to contain a nesting chamber neatly
constructed and most comfortably furnished.
Vent holes, cleverly hidden, provide sufficient
ventilation. Two large green eggs are usually
laid, and a strong smell of musk pervades
the nest.

“Ming”: An ornithological mystery _of
Maoriland is the arrival of the tiny white-
eyes in that country. These small birds,
whose wing-power is not that of the migra-
tory standard, came one stormy night in
thousands crowding round the lamp of one
of the southern lighthouses. In the morning
heaps of the little victims lay dead on the
ground, but a sufficient number escaped to
make the wliite-eye fairly plentiful m Maon-
land. But why and whence they made their
remarkable flight is still a matter of con-
troversy among birdmen. ’ #

“Centre”: Has any Abo. bushman tried
myrtle for tool-handles? I’ve been using the
wood now for over 12 months in a 4 3 1 b.
mattock and a 121 b. sledge-hammer, and

said, he wasn’t the only man on the wallaby

work in a motor-car. From his talk I
gathered that, in addition to the usual
rations, it was customary to ask for a drink
for Lizzie. Also, instead of inquiring about
grass and water on the tracks ahead, as
when travelling with horses, he was con-
cerned about petrol, and steered for places
where motors were kept.

THE MAN
ON THE LAND'S
PAGE
OIL BRANDS.
“Taharangi” : “Bidgee” (B. 31/3/27) fails
to make out a case for the abolition of the
oil-brand on sheep. Ear-marks, although
necessary, are not conclusive evidence,
especially in districts such as the granite
country of New England, where sheep are
not bred, hut are brought in by the tens
of thousands every year from other parts
of N.S.W. and Queensland, and carry every
ear-mark under the sun. In cases where
a fence has been broken, the boundary-rider
can instantly spot any stray sheep by a
glance at the brand without having to closely
inspect every sheep in the paddock. Different
colors and positions of the brand can be
used to indicate the sex and age of various
mobs, thus avoiding the labor and damage
entailed in mouthing the mob when drafting.
And is “Bidgee” quite willing to dispense
with the protection afforded by the T brand
on travelling stock?
As regards manufacturers’ complaints,
although these gentlemen are entitled to be
heard, they want the earth, served up on
toast, as every woolgrower knows; and it
is very doubtful if they would adequately
compensate the grower for the extra work
and losses arising from the abolition of the
oil-brand,
* * * ■*
“Trepex”: “Bidgee” need not be so con-
cerned about tar brands (B. 31/3/’27). In
18 years’ experience on the wool-selling floors
of Sydney I have not once heard buyers
take exception to this supposedly dreadful
detraction to wool, and I can assure “Bidgee”
that it does not make the least difference
to the price. The reason is that nowadays
few, if any, people brand their sheep with
the old “tar,” preferring lamp-black and oil,
or some similar mixture readily soluble in
any liquid stronger than cold water. Only
a few old fogies from Bradford and some
squealers from Mazamet, in France, where
they treat large numbers of sheepskins from
all over the world, ever revive the old wail.
IRON FENCING-POSTS.
“Dundoo”: “Saaedi” (B. 31/3/’27) speaks
of iron fencing-posts coming into general
use.. I belong to a district where pine is
getting scarce and a fair number of “cork-
screw” (iron) posts have been erected. Here
is the best way to make a job of it. Drive
the posts in every 12 feet, put a solid stayed
strainer every 10 chains and key a 12-gauge
barb on as top wire. Then about every
chain or so key a dummy pine or box post
to the fence, to make sure that it retains
its perpendicular. I’ve seen men put a pine
post in the line every third or fourth post
and run the wires through. But I’ve found
my plan better, for if a fire comes along
the dummy is burnt out without hurting the
fence; whereas if a post in the line is burnt
out the wires go with it. And then the
sheep get boxed.

“Waimea”: “Saaedi” is right when he
says that iron is going to play a big part
in the fencing of Australian sheep country.
The heavy metal has put up quite a sub-
stantial appearance already. Since the recent
bush-fires one Sydney firm has sold 350,000
steel corkscrew fencing-posts, entirely Aus-
tralian-made. The trouble with wooden
posts and droppers is that, apart from burn-
ing themselves, they burn through the wires,
which makes the very devil of a mess of the
fencing.
* # * *
“Jacky Roo”: Iron posts and droppers
have not proved very successful, as they
cannot withstand the onslaught of a beast
or a horse—and every sheep-station must
carry a few head of cattle. I have heard
iron posts cursed fervently by everyone on
the land except fencers. Concrete posts,
although more expensive to construct, make
a fireproof fence that will last for ever
and withstand the charge of an elephant.
“Biro”: I hope Australia will never think
that iron is a good substitute for wood-posts
in' fencing. On many N.S.W. Southern Tabie-
land properties there is a shortage of split-
ting timber. The little that remains has
to be blown open with gunpowder before
posts can be split. Many of the holdings
have been in the same hands for 30 years,
and others much longer. And the owners
have gone calmly on using up the timber,
picking it over and over and never planting
a single tree to replace it! They have cheer-
fully killed out the timber beside the creeks
- —and wondered at the dwindling water
supply! When the timber on hilltops is
destroyed, valuable shelter both for winter
and summer is lost to the stock; and the
birds, friends of the man on the land, go
farther afield for nesting places. The twigs
that would otherwise lie upon the soil pre-
venting the water from escaping and keeping
the ground mulched, are swept away at the
first flood and there are none to replace
them. The owner says his land is becoming
“washed” and ridgy, but he refrains from
planting trees. lie thinks they stop the
grass fro.m growing! His tanks become silted
up, but he cannot see that the reason is
because the hills are bare of timber. Yet
if one settler began planting trees on the
bare hilltops, how soon his example would
be followed by others!
FODDER CONSERVATION.
“T. J.”: Sooner or later a drought will
set in, and the swarming jumbucks (we
are very heavily stocked in N. S. Wales),
aided by rabbits, will quickly eat the country
out, and hand-feeding will have to be resorted
to. To the uninitiated, conservation of fod-
der for sheep in drought time seems a simple
matter. “You have your good seasons,”
the city business man will tell tin- grazier—-
“why don’t you set aside a store of fodder
to carry you over a lean year? I insure my
buildings against fire ; why don’t you insure
your sheep against drought?” It sounds
all right, but in most cases there are serious
difficulties.
To begin with, natural grasses cannot be
utilised for ensilage to any extent. Lucerne
is out of the question in most pastoral areas.
Perhaps the most practicable crop for the
“WHY DIDN’T YOU BLOW YOUR HORN, YOU SILLY COW?"
purpose is wheat. Cut when green, it makes
admirable silage. When the pastoralist sets
out to make silage of this kind, however,
he must: be prepared to revolutionise his
business. From being solely a grazier he
must become farmer and grazier. A farming
plant, horses, ploughs, etc., must be pur-
chased ; land cleared, and labor employed
extensively. Cutting the crop frequently
clashes with shearing, and the grazier is
liable to get muddled through mixing his
jobs.
Apart from this, the large outlay must
be considered. To place the silage in pits
is costly, particularly in view of the fact
that pastoral country is rarely good wheat
country, and failures are very frequent. If
droughts were short, the cost might not mat-
ter so much. But droughts are sometimes
prolonged affairs, and it would be easy to
spend a lot of money and then find that the
drought had outlasted your supply. It would
he easy, too, for the cost of the silage con-
sumed to exceed the value of the stock saved.
I have known very many instances of sheep
“eating their heads off” in a drought, and
more instances of cattle performing the same
feat. One trouble about livestock is that
their values vary so greatly from year to
year. Three years ago store sheep were
worth nearly three times as much as they
ire to-day. Where it might pay to feed a
jumbuck worth 30s. for a very considerable
while, it isn't going to pay to feed an animal
worth 10s. for long.
These few points serve to explain why
graziers generally are reluctant to embark
on the expensive business of fodder conser-
vation. Nevertheless, many graziers who
have been storing fodder for years claim that
it pays them well. To me it seems that the
business should be carried on by farmers in
farming districts. The difficulty to date has
been that far too little stock-fodder has been
grown by farmers, and hence prices are
exorbitant during a drought. Farmers de-
clare that the growing of fodder doesn’t pay,
because droughts aren’t frequent enough to
ensure a regular market. Perhaps if graziers
purchased a certain amount of fodder from
the farmers each year, to store against the
inevitable shortage, a satisfactory system
might be evolved. But it is a case for united
action.
“FEED THE BRUTE!”
“Phairdooz” : Barely a week goes by with-
out a press story of an attack by a trusted
bull on his owner or attendant; and
almost invariably the offender is a dairy bull.
It doesn’t seem to occur to complainants that
the feeding of the animal might have some-
thing to do with his outburst of bad temper,
for the bull, like other husbands, is apt to
go sour if his meals don’t suit him. The
average dairy bull is not often fed on scien-
tific lines, but is left to run with his herd
and feed himself, like his cousin of the cattle-
stations. This is largely due to the old
obsession that, to be at his best, a bull must
be kept vigorous and free from inside fat.
This system is convenient to the casual
dairyman, but it is doubtful if it pays in the
end. Apart from developing crankiness, it
impairs the brute’s utility. Dairy bulls,
like the grandees of the big studs, should be
given a regular hand-fed ration —corn, bran
and occasional linseed meal, with lucerne
hay daily, or, failing that, occasional feeds
of silage; and free access to water is
advisable. Even with plenty of artificial
grasses a variation of diet is imperative to
get the best results. On big runs the herd
bull cannot be dry-nursed, though it is highly
advisable to do something of the sort where
possible. Every milk farm should be able to
make some special provision for the herd
father, and the improvement in quality of
subsequent stock should set all doubts on the
subject at rest.
DIPPING.
“J.D.C.”: In view of the great spread
of the types of vermin which infect sheep,
particularly bS*e, it seems to be almost in-
evitable that dipping will be proclaimed com-
pulsory in N. S. Wales. Stock inspectors
now have the power to place in quarantine
any infected mob, and to order such stock
to be dipped. But small owners in particu-
lar regard compulsory dipping as an imposi-
tion, and carry out the wmrk so perfunctorily
that as a means of freeing the beasts from
vermin it may be quite useless. Usually the
first filling of the bath is done all right, but
as the level is reduced someone suggests more
water, with the result that the mixture is
broken down to such an extent as to be
useless. Then an addition of dip is made
by guess, and the stuff may immediately
become dangerous. If deaths follow dip-
ping, or if ticks and lice are still found to
(Continued on pa fie 31.)
be living, the brand of dip is condemned —
not the method of using it.
Various types of bath are in use, but so
long as the sheep are immersed long enough,
results are the same. Getting them into the
bath is one of the main troubles; in spite
of everything, it usually resolves into man-
handling them. First time through is not
so bad, but sheep never seem to forget the
experience. It should be possible for some-
one of a mechanical turn of mind to produce
a travelling floor on the endless chain prin-
ciple, which would save an enormous amount
of labor.
A common mistake in the construction of
a dip is to allow the drainage from the pens
to run back into the bath at or near the exit
end. It should be carried by pipe back to
the entrance end. and then admitted through
coarse gauze. If the drainage is allowed
to flow in at the exit end while the sheep
are coming through, it will be found that
the “bow wave” caused by their progress
will meet the flow from the pens and cause
the solid content to precipitate at that end.
An examination after the dip has time to
settle down will reveal that the precipitate
is lodged much more heavily at that end,
and as a consequence, when again stirred
up, the dip mixture there is much stronger
than is laid down by the directions.
Dipping should not be carried out in
extremes of weather, nor should stock be
driven hurriedly to or from the scene. If
overheated when put in, they are inclined
to drink; also, the pores being open, there
is a strong probability of poison being
absorbed through the skin. The same absorp-
tion may occur if driven too soon after
dipping. All skin wounds contracted at
shearing must be thoroughly healed, for the
same reason. Ewes are sometimes drafted
from young lambs, dipped and permitted to
rejoin the lambs. This is asking for trouble,
as, the points and udder being about the
last to dry and the lambs being hungry,
some of them are sure to be poisoned.
A properly-mixed dip with an oily base
has a more lasting effect than the powder
form. It combines better with the natural
grease of the wool; and, owing to the rapid
growth of the fleece, this is essential. It is
doubtful if any mixture at present in use is
effective for the whole 12 months between
shearings; nevertheless, the dipping of three-
quarter woolled sheep is difficult, expensive
and unsatisfactory.
An easily-constructed dip for small mobs
is in use in S.A. and known as a “U” dip.
It is excavated in the form of a U, about
Bft. Sin. in width at the surface and narrow-
ing to about 2ft. at a depth of 4ft. 6in„
and 15ft. long. Concrete lightly round the
wall and put a division of any kind along
the centre (sheet-iron will do) to within
2ft. of the end of the U. The sheep enter at one
leg of the U, swim round the curve and out
up the other leg, getting a 30ft. swim, and
if ducked a couple of times this will be
found sufficient. It is not recommended for
general use, but saves money for the man
with a couple of thousand or so.
FARM ACCOUNTS.
“Gadfly”: At the Producers Con-
sumers’ Conference, Bathurst (N.S.W.), in
September, 1926, much discussion centred
around cost of production, and arising
therefrom the various sectional committees
attempted to set down certain figures cover-
ing costs of production for various com-
modities, e-g., wheat ss. 6d. per bushel (inci-
dentally, wheat is now quoted at 4s. 6d.
per bushel). How many farmers are able
to make a guess at the cost of production, or
even know liow to go about making an esti-
mate, and what items are to be considered?
The first essential is to keep accounts. It
is surprising that so few farmers keep
records in connection with their business.
Farming is a business, just as much as that
of any other manufacturer, so that the
farmer should be constantly coi widening
two questions: (1) What profit, if any, is
my business making? (2) How can that
profit be increased? Answers to these ques-
tions can only be furnished by keeping accu-
rate records of all transactions during the
year. Of particular use to the dairy-farmer
is the recording of the production and feeding
of the individual cows of the herd. If a
new hired man was such a dud that he
couldn’t milk more than half as many cows
as the man next him, the farmer would
soon get rid of him. Yet the same farmer
will year after year not only keep an
utterly indifferent cow, but actually breed
from her.
“FEDERATION” AND FARRER.
“Chemagri” : Though of late years Federa-
tion wheat has been superseded by newer
varieties, its fame has travelled as far
afield as the United States. In a com-
paratively recent issue of the Satttbday
Evening Post, an article by Secretary-for-
Agrieulture William Jardine featured some
illustrations of Federation wheat in the
stook. Eager to find out whether this was
the Federation evolved in Australia by
Farrer, I wrote to the Department of Agri-
culture in Washington. Promptly the reply

disastrous fires
For many years fire appliances capable
of dealing with fires of an ordinary nature,
such as m’ght occur in offices, have been
in general use, but the widespread in-
troduction of petrol and fuel oil saw the
advent of a fire risk demanding a new
extinguishing medium which would, in
addition, be adequate for dealing with
fires involving inflammable liquids. After
lengthy research, the last decade saw the
intro duct on of the FOAMITE method
of F re Protection with portable equip-
ment and fixed installations producing a
fire extinguishing medium (Firefoam)
which met this demand.
Fiercely blazing petrol, paint, tar—
which defy other extinguishing methods
—are easily smothered under Firefoam.
Ordinary fires die instantly. The foam
not only puts out the fire but prevents re-
ignition.

came back that this was the Australian
wheat, introduced into the United States in
1915, and first commercially grown in 1918.
I was further informed that during 1925, in
the Pacific Coast and Intermountain States,
there were 400,000 acres of wheat land
planted to Federation.
And with the thoughts of the propagator
of a wheat variety that has achieved an
international reputation come visions of the
poor figure the Australian wlieatgrower cut
in the attempt to establish a memorial to
him.
IX THE WESTRALIAN WHEAT BELT.
“Blackboy”: The Westralian wheat
belt is as large as Victoria, and the
rainfall, though less copious than in
some other grain-growing parts of the
world, is more regular. There has been only
one real drought in 20 years, and then good
farmers who had fallowed systematically got
a fair crop. Because of these facts, and for
geographical reasons, patent after a glance
at the map, Westralia is destined to be our
leading wheat State. However, in areas
not served by Forrest’s water scheme—it is
largely an agricultural proposition nowadays,
though designed for the East Coolgardie gold-
fields—domestic supplies are apt to run out
before the end of ttie long summer, and it is
impossible to keep sheep. Thus there is
waste of time and money in carting and
waste of natural wealth. To overcome this
difficulty, the Collier Government, whose
Agricultural Minister, M. F. Troy, is himself
a successful farmer, has embarked on exten-
sive and very interesting schemes.
In various parts of the wheat belt there
are huge rock areas which make perfect
catchments. The utilisation of these will, it
is believed, render farming profitable in the
extensive Lake Brown district, which is on
the edge of the lOin. rainfall belt. At Bar-
balin, in this district, there are 272 acres of
clean rock, and it is proposed to blast out a
storage reservoir with a capacity of
35,000,000 gallons. A second rock has a
clean surface of 90 acres; here there is to be
a reservoir with a capacity of 7,500,000
gallons. A third rock has life acres of sur-
face, and it is to furnish a reservoir with a
capacity of 21,700,000 gallons. The capital
cost of this particular scheme is estimated
at £268,000, and water will be supplied
through 329 miles of piping to serve towns,
farms and railways within a region of
480,000 acres.
At Narembeen a rock catchment of 110
acres is being utilised, and at Kondinin one
of 70 acres. The capacity of the storage
reservoirs in these two districts respectively
will be 15,500,000 gallons and 10,000,000
gallons, and the capital cost respectively will
be £76,000 and £47,000. The total piping- to
be laid will be 126 miles. In the Salmon
Gums-Grass Patch country, north of Esper-
ance, another big reservoir is to be provided
from a rock catchment 60 acres in extent.
These works will be an insurance against
drought, and will enable farmers, who have
hitherto had to rely solely on wheat, to keep
stock —sheep and pigs especially—on a large
scale, while greatly increasing the comforts
of life in the districts served.
THE MERINO IN SOUTH AFRICA.
“FY7”: South Africa’s adoption by pur-
chase of the Australian merino goes back
farther than many suppose. Recently the
veteran W. B. Slade, of Glengallan station,
near Warwick (Q.), received a letter from
a S. African who had bought his first Glen-
gallan sheep in 1888. This is G. L. Blaine,
of the Cape, and, referring to recent pur-
chases from the Darling Downs station, he
said he had maintained the flock’s character-
istics consistently. The Slade connection
with Glengallan goes back to the 1860’s and
the run’s merino wool has always been noted
for its fine, super-combing qualities. That
these have not suffered in S. Africa is shown
by Mr. Blaine’s statement that his net wool
return from these merinos for the past three
years has been 13s. a head p.a.—a return
that compares favorably with the best Aus-
tralian figures, and one which emphasises
the value of fine-wool growing, at which the
Australian grazier is inclined to look askance
nowadays.
DISEASES IN WHEAT.
“Dundoo”: “R.J.N.” (B. 7/4/’27) speaks
of diseases in wheat and their prevention.
Copper-carbonate is certainly one of the best
preventives. Continued dry weather before
seeding and resultant dry ground is the
best of the lot. I have never pickled if the
ground has been dry, and I have had no
smut in those years. Incidentally, one
very seldom finds a head of self-sown wheat
affected by it; and that ought to suggest
something. The drier the ground and the
longer it keeps dry after seeding the less
chance of infection. Once rain falls during
the cropping season treatment for prevention
must commence. Wheat may be treated with
copper carbonate months before sowing with
no ill effects upon the grain, but with the
almost out-of-date wet pickle seed should be
sown soon after treatment.
As a prevention against flag smut, I have
been working on. a rotation method: Fallow,
eats on the wheat stubble and then out;
fallow, oats on the stubble, out, and so on,
and find it a success.
NORTH AND SOUTH SUGAR.
“Kopai” : There is again a lot of talk in
the sugar districts about Üba and other
canes. Since the Australian industry over-
took Australian demand, with the result
that a surplus enters into competition with
the rest of the world not governed by white
labor and fair-wage rules, research has
been directed towards reducing production
costs. The best means is a bigger yield to
the acre and a better sugar-content; but it
is one of. the compensations of Nature that
best-yielding and best-milling canes are least
resistant to disease and most needful of
grower's’ attention. Australian experiment
has produced a number of very well-yielding
canes, but all of them subject to the handi-
caps mentioned. Üba. a standard cane in
S’Africa, is weedy-looking, but with the
resistance and strength of a weed and a
capacity to smother intruding growths. Thus
and otherwise it requires little more atten-
tion than a crop of meadow hay. Its sugar-
content is high, but on account of the amount
of foreign matter (from a sugar-miller’s view-
point) in its texture it is hard to mill, and
therefore expensive to the miller. Millers’
influence has been successful, therefore, in
having Üba placed on the Queensland official
blacklist, and its planting is forbidden to
the grower who is not also a miller. The
rivalry of the north, not so susceptible to
diseases and climatic knocks, has led the
south to turn again to Üba as a saviour by
reason of its big yield, good sugar content
and easy growing, and a campaign has been
launched to have the embargo On this variety
lifted.
FOALS A MONTH APART.
“Paul 0.” : Re the gestation period being
abnormally extended in rare cases in mares.
An abnormality was brought under my notice
on the Williams River (N.S.W.). A friend
sent a draught mare to Dungog, “No foal
no pay.” The mare was sent home with
the intimation that she was O.K.’d on a
certain date. Soon, however, she was seen
to be interested in a pony stallion my friend
kept in a small paddock. The pony got
over the fence, and qualified to be cited as
co-re. in the case. My friend notified the
Dungog studmaster, who could not under-
stand the incident in the face of what he
knew, but admitted that in the circum-
stances he could not expect payment. How-
ever, in due course the mare had a draught-
foal, to the astonishment of her owner. Then,
a month afterwards, to his utter consterna-
tion, she gave birth to another foal, carry-
ing all the characteristics of the pony sire.
It was a rare case of two separate concep-
tions and corresponding periods of gestation.
“Glcnfield”: Farmers in the North Mallee
(Vic.) lose a number of horses at this time
of year, and the cause is often regarded as
a mystery. One man has lost eight in a
week. The trouble is due to bringing in
horses mud-fat off the wheat stubble to work
at summer fallowing. The intense heat of
the day causes the horses to blow and sweat
freely. They spend the night in mostly-open
stables; and as at this season the nights are
as chilly as the day was hot, inflammation
of the lungs and pneumonia result.
* * * *
“Paul C.”: A method adopted for the dual
purpose of preventing Strawberry from either
jumping fences or sucking herself, which she
will sometimes do, is to put a surcingle round
her body and a head stall on her head. A
round stick with a hole bored in each end is
then fastened at the animal’s chin and to
the surcingle between the front legs. The
creature can thus feed comfortably, but, not
being able to raise her head above the level
of her body, she cannot jump; and, not
being able to get her head round, she cannot
help herself to her own milk.
* * * *
“J.D.C.”: Re mares carrying foals over-
time (B. 31/3/’27). The late arrival is
invariably a colt. The same peculiarity
exists in the case of the elephant, whose
period of gestation is about 18 months for
a female calf, but the expectant mother will
sometimes carry a male calf as long as 23
months. This seems to indicate that sex
has something to do with the puzzle.
*** . *
Egg-laying competitions draw attention
to the potentialities of the hen. Breeding
and selection have been responsible for the
improvement in the average per bird, which
now runs to 195-205 per lien for the whole
of the N.S.W. competitors. This is the
average for presumably selected birds; but
what about the average production on farms V
The N.S.W. Government Poultry Expert
states that it is only a very small number of
farms with an average of 160. On most of
the farms the number is believed to be some-
where about 140. Plainly there is a great
deal more to do in the way of careful tabula-
tion and selection.
* * * * *
“G.F.Y.”: The climatic and agricultural
conditions of Australia are most suitable for
the raising of first-class pigs. Why, then, has
the industry been so neglected during recent
years? The main reason generally put for-
ward is the absence of an established export
trade. The exploitation of the British market
(in 1919 Great Britain imported pork and pig
products to the value of over £100,000,000)
has been left to the foreigner. It is time
the Australian producer became wider awake
to the possibilities in this direction.
* * * *
“Max”: Re “G.B.L.’s” garden (B.
31/3/’27), I don’t think scarlet kurrajongs
are very rare. There is a large and very
beautiful one in Dundas, near Parramatta
(N.S.W.), and in the same district there was
until recently a magnificent one on the old
Auchterlonie property. When it flowered in
midsummer it flamed like a glorious torch on
the hillside. People often walked out from
Parramatta just to see what the lovely thing
could be. I know where there are three or
four handsome young scarlet kurrajongs 12ft.
high, but as I’d hate to see them attacked by
an idiot with an axe, I won’t give them
away.
“G.F.Y.”: Not often do we find a whole
district setting itself out regularly year after
year to grow fodder specifically for the pur-
pose of conserving it as silage. For the past
25 years or so the Tilba district (South
Coast, N.S.W.) has been developing the prac-
tice, and it is now estimated that some 30
or 40 farmers in a group have an average
of three silos to every farm. The silage is
used every year, and certainly, in some cases,
the cheques are bigger in winter than in sum-
mer. Maize (yielding up to 30 tons of green
fodder per acre) is the crop ensiled.

“Koschei” : Yes, there are horses that are
incurably bad, and there’s only one thing
to do with them. A colt I used to ride had
a habit of lashing out suddenly, and this
after he had behaved well for a week or so.
Naturally, after the first attempt, I never
gave his heels another chance. Then he
turned over a new leaf, and we became so
friendly that I was inclined to trust him.
One morning when I went into the yard he
walked out of the mob towards me. I
thought: “Good old neddy! He likes me so
much now that he’s coming over to nuzzle
me.” I reached out to stroke him on the
nose, and he struck at me with his forefoot,
grazing my forearm and taking a piece out
of me. Then he hurried back into the mob.
I don’t know who owns him now.

Madame Melba declares that when she

The obvious bridegroom was paying his bill
at the office of a Ballarat pub the other day,
and, in reply to the usual remark that they
hoped he had been comfortable, he bared his
soul. “Yes,” he said, “had a bonzer time. If I
ever have the luck to have another honey-

’ll do me.”

The imnervious Macintosh was naturally

The lady orator waxed sentimental. "Wluit

a coarse male voice replied: “Your baby!”
Nellie Melba assured an interviewer last

A man who ran along Ocorge-street, knock-

“We get some terrible mugs in our pro-

The lady was addressing the room on the
need for still further enlarging the independ-

iron-bars of convention,” she declared. “Oh,

But W. J. Ferguson’s was best of all the
iron-bar japes. It was while he was await-
ing trial for conspiracy in connection with
one of Broken Hill’s big. strikes. A lady
sympathiser called on him in. prison. “Never
mind, Mr. Ferguson,” she said —“stone walls
do not a prison make nor iron-bars a cage.’
“Perhaps not, Madam,” said Ferguson—“but

When Beatrice Grimsliaw was last in
Papua, Judge Murray gave her the box seat
at a court sitting. A number of hillmen
were charged with having thrown spears at
the police. It appeared, however, that no
blood was shed and the defendants were told
that they were very naughty, and if they
were let off this once they must promise
not to go a-spearing policemen any more.
Their eyes streamed with tears and they spoke
passionately and all together for several
minutes. Miss Grimshaw asked what they
were saying. “They say,” said the Judge,
gravely, “that they prefer death. If they
are not allowed to throw spears at the police
they have no further joy in life.”

DAN’L WEBSTER,
“Ajax”: We were discussing the jumping
capabilities of the ’roo. Several performances
were narrated, but measurements could not
be verified, especially in the case of the
longest reported jump; whereupon appeal
was made to one Jack, who had not joined
in the discussion.
“Well.” said Jack, “I can quite believe the
story after what happened to me.” Jack
then related how, a few years previously, he
had made an appointment to meet a man at
the railway station about five miles from
his place on a certain day at noon. “It had
been raining pretty hard for about a week,
and in the morning, when I was having-
breakfast, one of the youngsters came in and
said that the water was over the bridge.
Well, I had to keep that appointment some-
how, and the nearest bridge was 13 miles
down the river and 20 miles from the railway
station. I should have to gallop all the way,
and the old mare had a shoe off. Still. I
had to make a try, and I bustled up the
paddock to catch the old mare. Then Dan’l
Webster jumped out of a bit of scrub.
“Dan’l Webster was a pet forester 'roo I

had; he’d earned his name from the easy
way he hopped over obstacles. I thought I’d
try Dan’l for the journey, and give the chaps
down the river a surprise. I used to put
the kids on his back for a ride sometimes, and
he took it quietly. So I ran him into the
crush and put the saddle and bridle on him
and took him up the road a mile or so. He
was skittish at first, but soon settled down,
so I put a bit of pace on coming back. My
old dog had followed me up the road, and when
I got up speed she began to whimper, being-
footsore. Dan’l hated dogs, and thought
this one was chasing him, so he used the
accelerator. lie hopped the gate near my
place in his stride, and headed straight for
the river, with the bit in his teeth. I
couldn’t jump off; we were going too fast.
So I sat tight, thinking the river would pull
him up. But no! When he saw the flood
in front of him, he just tucked his hind-
quarters under him and gave a spring from
the edge. I shut my eyes, and pictured to
myself a struggle in midstream, hampered
with a kicking ’roo; but he cleared the lot.
I thought he’d ha’ come a gutser when he
landed ; but he saved himself with his fore-
paws. Then I gave a sigh of relief
EASY ARITHMETIC.
GLADYS (watching Pyggsbody on route for
his car): “That’s the gentleman with the
four-seater!”
and rode up to old Jim’s place, just across
the river, and hooked Dan’l up to the fence,
and dug Jim out, and he said he’d drive me
over to the station.
“I took the saddle and bridle off Dan’l and
turned him towards the river, and set .Tim’s
dog after him. He cleared it easier going
back than he did coming, for I was riding-
-12 stone.”

was told to keep

minutes broke out
again with the
same complaint.
This time the magi-
strate told her to
take her troubles

reigned for half an
hour, when the

more annoyed,
again made the
same complaint.
T h e magistrate,

the old lady had

curtly. “Whoshe funeral?” he gurgled.

head, inflicting a wound. Scorned the basin-
sinuation, apparently.
MOVE ON, CUPID!
Like reedy pipings of a flute,
With ardent words he urged his suit:
“No armies led by tyrant hand
Could move me from my plighted stand.
Till Death swoops down I shall not flinch,
Nor from my purpose move an inch.
Each planet in the sky may move,
A fickle star slip from its groove ;
But I shall scorn Man, Time and Tide
To win you, precious, for my bride!”
Then on the scene arrived a John,
And with a finger moved him on!

I’d like to break a friendly lance
With those who say we lack romance.
Sixty or seventy years ago
Swift horsemen’ urged, straight as the crow,
Through virgin scrub and roadless plain
A hundred miles, scarce drawing rein,
That each the claimant first might be
Of the copper find that made those three
Towns ranking in poetic queue—
Kadina, Moonta, Wallaroo.
From overseas the Cousin Jacks
Of Cornwall steadily made tracks,
With wives and all their ends-and-odds
And Cornish boo-ays and girls in squads;
And soon all Pols and Pens and Tres
Were busy as so many bees.
But now, Alas ! and Ichabod !
The glory’s gone. The chastening rod
Of time has followed on his frown.
All’s out of joint, for “copper’s down.”
Yet though the mines and works be bare
The towns they reared still stand four-square.
On dumps forlorn the humble goat
Still furnishes a homely note.
The chapels on the corner places
Display their unpretentious faces.
And pra-achers thunder forth their strictures,
Just as you see them in the pictures.
In frankest phrase; no old-time Quaker
Was quite as friendly with his Maker.
For them, at least, I hope to see
One form of immortality;
For every Cornish man and boy
Contributes to the nation’s joy
In unsuspected ways—one part
Is as a fund for comic art.
So, spite of innovating vandals,
The “Jacks,” their whiskei's, hats and
candles,
Pasties and every outward sign
Live on in Oswald Pryor’s line!

appeared with such marked success
at the Criterion Theatre, Sydney, is
a Rexona Girl, and writes us as
follows: “I have found Rexona Soap
delightfully refreshing, stimulating
and emollient, and feel I must write
and tell you about it. Since my
return to Australia 1 have become a
most enthusiastic Rexona Girl—be-
cause Rexona Soap, I find, is so splen-
did for the skin. I intend to take
back to America with me a supply to
last me some years. Having dis-
covered a toilet requisite so precious,
1 do not intend ever to be without it
again.”

Three charming
studies of Miss
JUDITH ANDURSON,
a beautiful Rexona Girl.
31
Rexona Girls are beautiful
girls. To be beautiful you
must have a good com-
plexion and bright, fresh,
clear skin. This is what
Rexona Soap does for its
devotees.
No matter if your features
are irregular, beauty is not
denied you, for every woman
can have a good complexion
if she but cares for her
skin by using Rexona Soap.
Rexona Soap is the ready
aid to those in search of skin
health and beauty. Every-
thing that is necessary for
overcoming complexion ills
is combined in its generous
creamy lather. Rexona Soap
refreshes and invigorates at
the same time, removes the
tendency to blotches, sallow-
ness, oiliness or roughness of
the skin.
No matter how particular
you may be, Rexona Soap is
sure to satisfy you, for it is
the aristocrat of soaps, pure
and free from harmful dry
chemicals. It is a facial
soap, specially suitable for
the most delicate skin.
Rexona Soap has no heavy
perfume, only the delightful
Rexona fragrance. It lathers
freely, cleanses perfectly
and leaves the face and hair
in the pink of condition.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
SHE was more like a human being than
any doll I have ever seen. She had
real hair, short silky hair which fell
over her cheeks and the back of her neck
in a shower of bright leaves, and real eye-
lashes. She had brown eyes which not only
opened and shut, but, by some wonderful
mechanism unknown to most doll-makers,
smiled. She could stand up, sit down, walk,
run, dance, sing and talk. It was no wonder
that when we first saw her we thought she
was real.
It was only when you knew her mother
that you realised that Cecily never had been,
and, except by a miracle, never could hope
to be, a human being. Op till that time,
1 in afraid, I had not been particularly decent
to her.
I Avas only sixteen then, and not very
understanding: I had been room-mating with
Cecily for a Avhole term, and had steadfastly
taken as little notice of her as I could. She
was everything I liked least. She had no
adorations and no hatreds, no wild theories
or passionate irritabilities, no thwarted emo-
tions, no sense of rebellion against parents,
churches or society in general, no unique
plans for the future, no desire to reform the
Avorld. She showed, in fact, not the slightest
sign of that unbecoming but healthy rash
which breaks out on every normal intelli-
gent creature between fourteen and twenty.
I shall never forget the consternation
roused by her answer to a question we shot
at her on the third night of her arrival.
“What do you think you’ll be doing in five
years from now?” we asked.
“Oh, I expect I’ll be married,” she said,
gently and positively.
You can imagine the effect on us—we, who
Avere all fairly certain that in five years from
now Ave’d be either understudying Irene Van-
brugh or running a ranch or dying under the
Ked Cross in the next war or leading the
fastest set in Melbourne. Married!
Still, we gave her another chance. Pro-
bably she had her mind on someone who’d
already sAvept her off her feet into a tor-
rent of wild, lost passion. Someone a lot
older than herself, a brilliant man, poAverful,
perhaps notorious. Someone like the ucav
MachiaA’elli. She Avas certainly lovely enough
to marry pretty Avell anything she liked. M e
pumped cautiously.
“What sort of a man do you think you’ll
marry?”
She looked up placidly. “Of course it would
be nice to care for someone distinguished
and rather good-looking. Position isn’t every-
thing, is it?”
She might as Avell have added “Although
it’s the centre thing.” She meant that. She
was not posing, she conceived of no other
possibility. She Avas going on as she was,
for perhaps tAA’o more years, until her music
and dancing and exquisite physical being were
completed. Then she would spend a little time,
say a year, between Portsea and the moun-
tains, floating round from one golf-house to
another until she found what she wanted.
Then tliere’d be an engagement-ring, and per-
haps a year’s travel, just to make sure she
hadn’t missed something with just a little
more money ; then home, and—finish !
I flicked her off my mind, and practically
thought no more of her until I had found,
rather to my horror, that we were both spend-
ing the May vacation at the same Marysville
holiday-house.
It Avas so that I met her mother, and
although, as I said, I was only sixteen and
had about as much tolerance as would lie
on a finger-nail, I realised that not from
the very beginning had Cecily had the slight-
est chance of being other than she Avas, and
I felt a stab for shaking her off so easily.
For even a child of strong character could
hardly haA-e stood against that personality
for fifteen years, and Cecily had never been
strong.
Mrs. Barnes was one of those massive,
indomitable Avomen who produce small, beau-
tiful, delicate daughters as peculiarly and
easily as clay soil produces roses. Mr. Barnes
came up for the week-ends, but he had long
ceased to exist as Mr. Barnes. His Avife,
following the excellent example of the female
spider, had devoured him almost immediately
after their marriage, and he was now merely
an infinitesimal part of that large, unconquer-
able existence.
Life was a simple thing for Mrs. Barnes.
She was, I think, positively the worst social
climber I have ever met, and it being early
pointed out to her by Fate that Cecily was
the only ladder by which she might ever
hope to climb, she had taken no chances of
loose nails or weak rungs. It had been her
almost sole activity.
Cecily had known almost from the time
she Avas born that her mission in life Avas to
lift her family into the paradise of the golden
circle, and by the time she was fifteen was
so perfectly trained that it was just as
though she had been born with the natural
desire. It was horrible, but I knew quite
certainly that if my father had happened to
possess two shops instead of twenty it would
not even have occurred to Cecily to cultivate
me. By the time I met her it was impossible
to tell what she might have been like had
her mother mercifully died when she was
born. Quite impossible.
Time went on; I visited her sometimes,
sometimes she visited me, and between us
there grew up a type of intimacy. For after
that vacation, in spite of her waxen, exaspera-
ting face and the deadly fixture of her soul,
there was something so pathetic to me in
this exquisite little doll that I could not
keep my mind off her for long. I was her
nearest friend, I think; for, if she had none
of the madnesses of our set, she had none
of the sillinesses of her own, and in any
case was kept rather too busy with extras to
cultivate anyone.
She moved about amongst us, always busy,
always pleasant, always immaculate, a per-
fect, beautiful little automaton, and in a
very little time I had practically forgotten
that I had ever thought she was real.
It was soon after our debut that, after all
this care, this almost royal care, she met
Garner Browne. Fate will always find a
chink somewhere to squeeze through.
The first I knew of it was when I saw
them coming out of Symport’s together one
Monday morning. They made the most incon-
gruous couple. lie was a huge thing, with
skin burnt almost black and eyes permanently
bloodshot from work in hot countries, and
a walk like something that has just stepped
out of a jungle. He was not looking where
he was going; he was staring down at Cecily
as though he would like to fall and die right
there under her feet. I had seen men look
at Cecily like that before, and it did not
shock me. What did startle me was that she
was not looking where she was going either.
I was round at her place directly after
lunch to borrow a book. While she was
looking for it, I remarked casually to the
bookcase that there was no need for men to
be over six feet —it was extravagance.
“Yes, he is tall, isn’t he?” she laughed,
but from where I sat I could see the color
rolling up in great waves into her hair.
“Cecily!” I gasped. “You don’t —you
aren’t?”
She turned on me a perfectly opaque face,
and smiled her old gentle smile. “Why,
Nome, how silly!”
Wax does not turn to flesh in a second,
and it was two hours before I found her
clinging to my hand and tumbling out over
me a mass of incoherent marvel.
His name was Garner Browne. She had
met him one day on a trip down the bay.
Her mother had had a headache and gone
downstairs to lie down; when she, Cecily,
had come up on deck again, she found their
hats and magazines scattered broadcast and
Garner busy picking them up. Before they
knew what they were doing, they were talk-
ing to each other. She had seen him three
times since then. He had no money, and had
been everywhere and everything during the
last twelve years trying to find some. Photo-
grapher. teacher, steward, trader, clerk,
journalist, sealer. He could not bear to be
still. But now, he said, he would sit in a
cell for the rest of his life if he could come
out once a year and look at her.
She knew it was madness, but some-
thing had happened to her—she would right
herself if she had time —she would—
she would! only, I would not tell
her mother? Then she fell into a storm of
tears, the first I had ever seen her weep.
They fell over her in a torrent that none of
my words could stop, and I sat back at last
like a child in a Grimm’s tale as I watched
wax and glass change to flesh and blood.
Her words splashed heavily down amongst
the tears. She had not known she was not
real, she had not known she had been
worked on wires, until Garner had lifted
her out of her doll’s house and stood her
on his shoulders to look at the world. Garner
was magic. The only magic in the world.
He would set her free. He had set her
free —and then back to that haunting doll-
cry that I would not tell her mother.
No, certainly I would not tell her mother.
I knew better than she that it was madness,
but to every marionette its hour of life. I
entered into it thoroughly and violently,
lied for her, ’phoned her on false invitations
—she was too bewildered and aflame to do
much for herself. He took her for day
trips in the country, for cheap tram trips at
night, for stolen dark hours into the picture-
shows, as he taught her passion and peril
and the music of the stars.
I don’t know what his idea was—they
were both too badly in love, I believe, to
have any ideas. But perhaps he had some
wild scheme of making money quickly, or
perhaps he hoped to pour his blood into her
soul until it was able to stand alone and
wait for him, or perhaps he realised the
tiny space of time they had and meant to
make the most of it. I don’t know, I never
met him. I did not see him again either,
until she arrived one day at my place with
a wide, heavy metal-framed photograph that
she had made him have taken, and asked
me to keep it for a little while.
The end came suddenly, though not with
discovery and battle royal between the lover
and mother, as we had expected it.
Running across the road to meet Cecily,
who was coming round the corner of Spring-
street on the front of a tram, running care-
lessly and criminally, merely so that he might
have another second with her, Garner put
his foot on a piece of banana-peel and
spun backwards under a car. He was killed
instantly. She went with him to the hospital,
and it was there that her mother found her.
In the days afterwards, as she sat frozen
on the edge of her bed, her hands crushed
into the pillows, her one living thought
seemed to be, not the loss of his magical
company or the terror of life without him,
but a sense of bitter treachery. “He promised
he’d never leave me, never go without me,
and he has. He knew I was nothing without
him, and he left me.” This was the burden
of her cry as she sat there, oblivious alto-
gether for the moment of the circle of awful
reproach which surrounded her.
I had to leave her there, right in the
middle of her unspeakable need of support,
for I had word from Sydney that my father,
who was staying there, had had a very severe
nervous breakdown, and wanted me with him.
I smuggled Cecily her photo, and left her.
I gathered nothing from her letters. They
were five-line documents asking information,
and giving none; utterly ignoring the anxiety
of my own. It was three months before I
saw her again.
For the moment I thought she was, again,
exactly the perfect doll. As opaque and
smooth and finished. Her mother had not
wasted those three months; health had been
partially repaired with the most rigid care,
and a nursing which amounted to hypnotism.
Cecily had been taken two trips, furnished
with an almost regal wardrobe, and already
mother was rewarded. Cecily was on the
verge of an engagement with the eldest
Bracecliff boy. The Bracecliffs, the big Brace-
cliffs, to whom even in her wildest dreams
Mrs. Barnes had not aspired ! I found her
wild with scarcely concealed rapture. Cecily
had more than redeemed herself. “Poor little
Cecily, all girls have these dreadful early
fancies^—even now her sentimentality makes
her quite naughty about that person’s photo.
She has hung it over her bed, and refuses,
absolutely refuses, to take it down. Much
better for the moment to say nothing about
it. Dear Neville —simply doting!”
I saw Neville Bracecliff that first night,
and he did dote. I gave him that in, but I
gave him nothing else, for there was nothing
to give. He was the complete product of a
worn-out family; soft mouth bulging over
weak chin, soft pouches hanging beneath
weak eyes, and a brain so exhausted that all
the words in his language could have been
put into one page of the dictionary. Cecily
greeted me in the prettiest manner, and
carried me upstairs to a room which was fast
collecting the beginnings of a trousseau.
Directly we got there, however, I tore
down the curtain between us by walking
straight over to the dark patch of glass
above her bed and staring at it. It was a
remarkably good photo, even down to the
tiny dark streaks in the corners of his eyes.
“You are avenging yourself on him for
dying by letting him sit there and watch
your preparations for Neville?” I asked.
She nodded. “Yes. He said he’d never
leave me. He promised. He was the only
thing in the world that could set me free, and
he didn’t. He died. He’s a liar.” She
gasped with pain as she leant against the
mantelpiece, and for a second I could almost
believe that everything downstairs was a
dream. Then the shattered fragments of her
face suddenly melted together into a smooth
mask, and she patted my hand. “Please
forget, Nonie, what I said. I’m sorry I’ve
worried you. Don’t cry; please don’t. Be-
cause what does it matter? What can it
matter whom I marry when I’m not alive —
when I’ve never been alive”—*—
But it is one thing to see a doll pretending
to be a human being and quite another to
see a human being pretending to be a doll.
I felt as though I should scream sometimes
as I watched her sewing monograms on under-
linen, as I went shopping with her, as I
listened to her pretty, suitable replies to
congratulations. I began to hate Garner,
too, with her own senseless, perverted hatred.
When a man has taken it into his hands to
create a soul, how dare he go spinning in
front of traffic! What was he about now to
sit there on the wall, calmly watching her
damnation. Why didn’t he come down out
of his frame and destroy Neville. What cal-
lous, bloodless things ghosts are! It is diffi-
cult to control your mind sometimes.
The weeks flew by; December caught
January, and February passed them both.
The first of March was Cecily’s wedding-day.
I stayed there the night before, sleeping,
as I always did, in the next room. In the
very early morning I heard a sound of fall-
ing. Because I was sleeping badly, and have
an easily curious nature, I got up and
wandered in to see which one of the metal
ornaments on the table beside her bed Cecily
had knocked over.
I found she had slept quite placidly through
the sharp sound which was strange, as
the thing which had fallen was the heavily
framed photo above her bed. It had, as
too-heavy pictures sometimes will, torn out
its hook completely from the wall, and tossed
first on to the bed, and from there to the
floor. I picked it up, and stood looking
down at the figure beneath me. She slept so
very well.
Then I pushed by the curtains quickly
and bent nearer to see whether that soft,
blue shadow near the end of her eyebrow was
a shadow or not. It was not. It was a quickly
deepening bruise. Tne photo, in falling, had
struck its corner against her temple.
The delicate light air of morning blew
over us as I caught her in my arms. But
the lovely hair fell back over my wrist, the
soft face slipped forward heavily upon my
arm. For Garner had already flown with
his doll to the mountains of the moon.
GEORGIA RIVERS.
Fis'-hooks.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
THE island of Lakolu, fertile gem of its
little group in the Pacific, had for years
adorned the black list in South Sea
mission circles. All attempts to bring oiu
copper-colored brother out of the twilight
of heathen ignorance to the light of faith
had dismally failed; all efforts to establish
a mission-station on the atoll had merely
resulted in an addition to the dietary-list of
the islanders.
It was therefore with the greatest surprise
that the mission ship John Wilson had
viewed in the tropic dawn a fleet of canoe;
rippling the placid sea from the direction of
the ill-famed isle. Ranging alongside, a
dusky spokesman put in a plea for the estab-
lishment of a mission-station.
The elder brethren, deeply versed in the
ways of their cannibal friends, shook their
heads. A trip to that golden shore per
medium of the digestive apparatus of _ a
Polynesian maneater had lost for them its
lure. Memories of the smoking ruins of
mission houses and all-too-evident traces of
banquets at which the missionary martyr
had been the chief centre of interest quenched
for them the fires of enthusiasm.
The canoes, crowded alongside, displayed
groups of friendly flower-decked natives
bearing all the signs of goodwill. Still the
elder missionaries hesitated.
John Stanton, fresh from slum work in
the brick jungles of old England, alone dis-
played any eagerness to take advantage of the
strange change of heart of the people. 11 is
zeal soon overcame the counsels of the elder
comrades, and a few hours later the ship’s
boats, accompanied by a fleet-load of happy,
smiling converts-to-be, were busy putting
ashore gear and supplies for another centre
from which the blessed light would dispel
the heathen gloom of the fair Pacific.
The John Wilson carried always beneath
her hatches the things necessary for the
establishment of outposts, and chief among
these was a mission- and store-house made
in sections for immediate erection.
Two days later the John Wilson, loaning
gracefully to the gentle breeze, dropped below
the blue horizon, leaving stalwart John Stan-
ton apparently well established in the bosom
of his happy congregation. Willing hands
had given every assistance in the unloading
of goods and gear, and in the erection of the
missioner's new home, while the flower-decked
women and children stood round and beamed.
Even the critical eye of the experienced old
skipper could detect no sign of hostility or
lurking treachery in the demeanor of the
happy islanders.
Of the intimate details of it nothing defi-
nite will be known. The last that the little
group on deck saw of John Stanton as the
good ship drew away to the north was a
wliite-clad figure waving adieu.
A tropic dawn of three weeks later brought
up the white sails of the John Wilson on her
return trip to take toll of the harvest reaped
by the young missionary. Landfall brought
to the watching eyes on board no welcome
smoke-trails. No fleet of welcoming canoes
put off from the shore. The beach, backed by
tropic forest, gleamed empty of human life;
and upon the little rise to the east no
mission- and store-house made a white patch
upon the green. A party landing upon the
deserted shore found no life; but where
the little home of the missionary had stood
only charred timbers and ashes remained.
After much search, the party left the scene
of the tragedy, all too aware of the treacher-
ous eyes that watched them from the leafy
fortress of the impenetrable forests.
It was long after that one of the mission-
ers, talking to an old native warrior, whom
lie was attending in his last sickness, heard
the reason for the strange desire for conver-
sion on the part of the people of Lakolu.
“It was not the word of the Great White
God they wanted, master,” said the old
man ; “it was fis’-hooks. Many are the iron
nails in the house of the white man, and
these, master, when bent and barbed, make
most wonderful fis’-hooks.”

of drought or flood, and by his preparedness for such times his progress may
largely be estimated.
Thrift does not mean the mere hoarding of anything, but the wise use of
such material, whether it be foodstuff, money or other material.
The conservation of money is a necessity in all walks of life, and the Savings

If you are looking for a farm, or an orchard, or a sheep-station, tell us your
requirements, and we will try to find out if there is anybody wanting to sell one.
If you want to discover what other people’s experience has been in growing linseed
or red cabbages, or anything else, we will invite them to help you.
If you want to get in touch with an old mate ; if you want to swap something; if
you want to find an opening for your boy or girl; if you want —well, no matter what
you want, The Bulletin Service Department has been created to help you get it.
It is at your disposal free.
There are thousands of things not known to anybody in The Bulletin office, but

tralian artists for the color blocks? —No. 46.
W. C. Penfold and Co., Ltd., 88 Pitt-
street, Sydney, stock all these.
Is there a school in Sydney that could give
me a course by correspondence of experting
in sheep-shearing machinery? —No. 44.
We don’t know any postal course. Dal-
gety’s run a school at Miller’s Point, Sydney.
The fee is £lO for a period limited to three
months. No classes between the end of June
and end of January.
A and B own adjoining small farms. A
wants to erect a paling-fence on the boun-
dary, but wants to put the palings on B’s
side of the fence. (1 ) Can B prevent A
from doing so? (2) Has A absolute control
of fence, if he puts it up six inches or so

(1) Yes, if A trespasses on B’s property.
(2) Yes; but control must not be exercised
unreasonably and to injury of neighbor.
For one going to the sea as a profession,
what subjects should he specialise in, in his
last months at school? — No. 23.
Mathematics and geography.
I am a Digger farmer driving an eight-
horse team, and both it and I am damn-near
mad with bot-flies. How can I keep the
pests away from the team? Failing that,
any preparation to take the eggs off ine
horses, as some of the gee-gees’ front legs
are covered ivith them. I’m sure the death
of two I had in the team was due to
bot-flies. — No. 26.
Somebody oblige?
I have had a humorous Australian story,
about 41 >OOO ux>rds, accepted as a serial by
the Queenslander. Will previous publica-
tion by that journal prejudice my chance of
finding a publisher to issue it in book form?
Will it enhance my prospects with publisher?
What is the address of the Authors’ Society?
—No. 33.
British Society of Authors wouldn’t be
much help. It sounds as if it might suit
the N.S.W. Bookstall Co. Serial publication
won’t prejudice book publication. Address
asked for is given elsewhere.
I have been on. the look-out for a suitable
name for my house for some months. When
reading the Mirror the other day I noticed
a par under the pen-name of “Kurri-ld.”
The appearance of this word has a certain
amount of fascination, but before choosing
it I would like to know whence it is derived
and its meaning. — No. 38.
Who wrote “God Save the King”? — No. 48.
The authorship is uncertain. Henry Carey
is claimed to have sung it as his own com-
position in 1740, but earlier forms of the air
and words are recorded. He divides the
credit with John Bull, who composed carols
and ballads a century before Carey was born.
A third candidate is James Oswald, who
worked in the publishing office where the
early copies of “God Save the King” were
printed, and afterwards became chamber com-
poser to George 111.
Is there a school in Sydney where I could
be taught etching? — No. 39.
The Society of Painter-Etchers conducts
a school of etching which includes lessons
in both aquatint and mezzotint, and which
meets every Tuesday evening at the Attic
Gallery, Callaghan House, George-street,
Sydney.
A fence that lias been erected over 40 years
acts as boundary between two properties. A
portion of fence is erected on high bank on
one property, leaving about one acre of low,
flooded land outside this fence. This has been
the boundary for 40 or wore years. Is it
now the actual boundary? — No. 24.
Yes, if it has throughout been accepted
as the boundary.
Can yon give me the names of one or tivo
reliable literary agents? I have a novel to
sell.— No. 34.

I have a Winchester single shot rifle;
barrel is very dirty. Oil, vinegar, hot water
and quicksilver have failed to clean it. As the
rifle was very accurate, 1 am anxious to put
it in use again. What’s the best thing to do?
—No. 32.
Business, Robbery, etc.
“Simon”: “Coot” (B. 31/3/’27) is right.
Australian timber is durable. When old l’yij
mont Bridge (Sydney) was demolished 25
years ago a coaclibuilder whose books I kept
bought a large quantity of either turpentine
or ironbark piles that had been more or less
submerged for a couple of generations. He
turned them into felloes and spokes, and
there were no complaints about them.
* * * *
“Emer” : A man—now in gaol, inevitably-
demonstrated what could be done with the
time-payment system. His dodge was to buy
a player-piano on hire-purchase and pay one
instalment. (They can be got now without
even a deposit.) He then raised money on
a bill of sale, using the instrument as secu-
rity, representing it, of course, as liis own.
Then he sold the music-machine privately, on
time-payment, accepting 24 promissory-notes
falling due in monthly succession, and
promptly discounted the notes. His next step
was to disappear. The difficulty of doing
that successfully seems to have been the only
weak point in the scheme.
* # * *
“C.Q.” : Boy Scouts have an annoying habit
of trying the edges of their little hatchets on
trees, to the detriment of the trees. If the
Vic. scout people can get the necessary
funds, they propose to reverse this destruc-
tive genius of the small boy and back it into
the stable of construction. The notion is to
acquire 300 acres and divide it into three-acre
lots. Each troop will be allotted a block,
will plant it with trees and will be l respon-
sible for its maintenance. As a recompense
for their heroic self-restraint I think the lads
should be allowed to plant one row of trees
on the understanding that they are allowed
to chop them down when they become chop-
pable.
* * * *
“Hayband”: I disagree entirely with
“Maurice G.” when he asserts (B. 31/3/’27)
that speed is rougher on roads than weight.
With the road-smashing performances of the
10- and 11-ton hay lorries (speed, 3 m.p.li.)
before it, Werribee (Vic.) Council was ham-
mering away at a load-limit as long ago as
1911. It’s a safe bet that Werribee is among
the 157 (out of 193) now aiming at an 8-
ton limit. I’ve seen a corduroy road stand-
ing on end after the passage of a 12-ton
bullock waggon. But the prize road-murderer
is the lumbering traction-engine. Near
Numurkah (Vic.) I steered one that liter-
ally ruined a mile of new road, taking one
day to do the damage.
“Harold Hardupp”: To a large extent
Gwladys did Egbert out of his job in the
office ; now Gwladys is threatened with a
mechanical eclipse. The boss starts the busi-
ness by dictating to the dictaphone; the
search for a machine which, fixed to the
record, will type it out automatically, has
led to the production of a contrivance which
makes no worse a hash of things than
Gwladys after a jazzy night. And there
are sure to be improvements.
* * * *
It’s a poor trust that blows nobody
any good. Maoriland sawmillers are
jubilant over the news that there has been
a big consolidation of timber interests on the
Pacific coast of U.S.A. They hope, and
believe, that this will mean bigger prices
for American timber, and consequently a
better chance for rimu and kauri to hold
their own in the domestic market.
* * * *
“Hobnob”: “Tom Ayto” (B. 24/3/’27)
is wrong in saying the Greeks haven’t got
a stranglehold on the Sydney fruit business.
They have, and I’ve proved it. When a
Sydney firm wanted to get the sole right
to use a certain trade description their
advisers induced them to sue in equity every
sweet and fruit shop that used the words.
The country shops were started on first,
and shortly after the petitions were issued,
shopkeepers from all parts of N.S.W. wrote
saying that they did not own the shops on
which their names appeared, but were man-
aging them for a Greek firm in Sydney.
The Greek firm confirmed this, and in nearly
every instance accepted service of the peti-
tions.
* * * *
“Oliiio”: Clermont (C.Q.) had a Chinese
bootmaker (B. 30/3/'27) for many years.
His family, when writer left in 1900, were
taking prizes at the school. Clermont can
also boast of having one of the few women
saddlers in business in the Commonwealth.
“Ratio”: One of the earliest Bulletin
jokes I recollect appeared below a drawing
in which Wirewhiskers, returned from -Mel-
bourne, was greeted with: “Who keeps the
pub there now?” Well, who knows where
the hotel is? I didn’t until I lately found
it —an unobtrusive joint—in Bourke-street.
* * * *
“Uramao”: Auckland (M.L.) grows in
population at the rate of 5 per cent, per
annum, and in 40 years reckons to be as
large as Sydney is to-day. The Shivery Isles
as a whole add to their muster at only half
that rate, but Auckland is the place where
the bulk of the borrowed money is spent.
“Weaver”: Motorists will soon be able
to buy good Australian cotton motor-coats
at about 10 bob apiece. So far no “load-
ing” has been introduced into Australian
cottons, which means that the new line can
be relied upon to fill up well in washing.
The local article ought to prove better value
than the dusters hitherto offering, whose
material is foreign and dutiable.
* * * *
“Haikwan” (Swatow, China) : “Feng-
Shui” (B. 20/l/’27), speaking of the in-
crease of Chinese-owned ships, states that
“practically all ships used are now built
locally.” Most of the coasting vessels are
the discards of the maritime nations of the
world. The river boats are, it is true, mostly
built here; but nearly all the 1591 vessels
engaged in inland navigation are small steam
launches, and unable to proceed to sea. The
figures certainly look good, but they are not
impressive to anyone who knows what they
are made of.
* * * *
“Garry”: On what income can a man run
a motor-car? An Australian authority—
he is in the trade and therefore, perhaps,
biased —reckons it can be done comfortably
on £4OO a year. A Maoriland examiner
of bankrupts, who had a case before him
where a linotype-operator getting £6 a week
was trying to keep a car, a wife and four
children, said he didn’t see how any family
man could run a car on an income of under
£5OO a year—particularly a second-hand one.
But everyone knows people who manage to
do it on less than that.
* * * *
“Carisbrook, Jun.”: I think the latest
reports on the beam wireless system should
quieten any adverse comments. The seven-
day test of the Australian system proves
that the beam is capable of maintaining
an average of 140,000 words daily—three
times the existing cable load. As for the
“Listening Insect’s” suggestion _ that the
beam would be “tapped,” I invite him to
“listen-in” on 35 metres and see if he can
decipher Morse at the rate of 200 to 300
words per minute. Even if anyone wanted
to decipher the beam, which is unlikely,
special instruments, obtainable from only
one or two reputable firms and exactly tuned
to the beam, would have to be secured. Asser-
tions that the cable system will remain
superior to the beam are sheer short-sighted
nonsense.
* * * *
“Momokeni”: You can’t generalise about
the most favored articles of trade amongst
New Guinea natives. On the coast one could
not give away salt or plane, irons, much less
trade them; in the mountains these are of
great trade value. To the mountain tribes,
salt is a highly-prized luxury, and plane
irons take the place of the obsidian stone
heads for adzes. On the coast salt water
is available to all and axes or tomahawks
are in universal use. Twist tobacco lias no
value inland, where the natives prefer their
home-grown and cured leaf; but it is
a staple article of trade on the coast. Blue
and white beads are fashionable everywhere,
but red ones also are prized for variety.
Whilst the more sophisticated natives gener-
ally choose a durable bliie or white cloth,
the raw bushmen evince interest in shoddy
Union Jacks and cheap, flimsy turkey-reds.
In many years’ experience I have never
heard of young girls being used in trade
transactions. Perhaps “Molokihi refers to
the custom of child adoption, which is quite
common throughout the delta regions, bur
monetary considerations do not enter
into these transactions. Exchanging wives
is an offence against the native
and is not a recognised native custom, except
with a few tribes in the western deltas.

SPORTING
NOTIONS
Under the VC^hip
Between S a.m. on Thursday and the. same
hour on Saturday 568 points of rain dis-
tributed themselves about Randwick. That
wouldn’t necessarily have meant postponing
the first day of the A.J.C. meeting had the
weather shown signs of clearing up on Satur-
day, but when the A.J.C. committeemen got
out of bed it was raining and blowing harder
than ever and there was no prospect of a
change to the conditions that racing clubs
love. So the Doncaster Handicap was post-
poned till Monday and the Sydney Cup till
Wednesday, the third day’s racing being
shifted to Friday, if circumstances allowed.
During the 48 hours preceding 8 a.in. on
Monday another 625 points came down,
nearly all on Saturday and after nightfall
on the Sabbath; in the daytime on Sunday
it was beautifully fine. Monday broke
gloomy, but after a swift succession of
showers there was a dry interval long enough
to entice a huge crowd to Randwick, people
being fed up with being indoors. The deceiv-
ing respite lasted till after the second race;
then the rain set in for the day and the
greater part of the next. Driven by a 50-
mile-an-hour. gale, it drenched just and un-
just, ruining innumerable complexions and
skirts and stockings and making the track
a morass. It was the dampest and most
dismal Doncaster within the memory of the
oldest follower of the game.
The going was heavy even before the rain
came again. That was shown in the Hurdle
Race, the “about two miles” of which occu-
pied 3min. 55fsec., whereas it has been
traversed in 3min. 384,sec. May Day, equal
favorite with .Jollity at 7 to 2, won by
lengths from L.C. (20 to 1) and Bronzino’s
Dream (10 to 1), all three being ninli-
steners ; the 11-stoners, Cash King, Piratic
and Pindarus, were a long way back. More-
over, it took Pantheon (6 to 1) 2min. 40]
sec. to cover 12 furlongs in the Autumn
Stakes, wherein he surprised his stable, for
he had been shaping indifferently in his
work. Fools laid as much as 5 to 2 on
Heroic, an unknown quantity on this side of
the Murray in heavy going, and when he
came into the straight alongside Piastoon
(25 to 1), who had cut out the pace, they
thought the money theirs. But, whether
because he couldn’t manage the going or was
in one of his rotten moods, he failed to
come on. First Valamita (33 to 1) and
then Imitator (50 to 1) looked like giving
McShortodds a skinner —it would have
amounted to that—but Brown brought
Pantheon along with a late run which
settled the mare by a neck and the ‘“restaur-
ant horse” by another half a length.
Piastoon, who stumbled when going pretty
well, was fourth, Heroic, next, and Count
Oavour last,, behind Nans.
After his victory at Warwick Farm
Amounis became favorite for the Doncaster,
and favorite he remained (5 to 1 was the
best price offered), notwithstanding his
‘lst. 121 b. and the state of the course. Top
Gallant, however, a bookmakers’ favorite
before Amounis downed Windbag, Limerick
and Yalicare, drifted to 14 to 1. and Fuji
San blew out to 2;> to 1. The surprise of the
course betting was the backing of the sup-
posedly infirm Grecian Orator from 25 to 8
to 1. Bravado, Reonui, Don Moon and
Horoscope had many supporters at 12 to
1: Wren and his friends were sweet on
Pigeon Pie, who firmed to 14 to 1; Wedding
Eye, briskly backed for small amounts, was
at the same figure; and a bit of money went
on Cave Dweller (16 to. 1), Persuasion and
Fool’s Paradise (20 to 1), Calmest (25 to 1)
and Chris (33 to 1), but Garrula (66 to 1)
was neglected except by a few speekers on the
tote. ....
The race was run in pouring rain, and
it was difficult to distinguish one horse from
another until they were well in the straight.
Top Gallant led early from Persuasion and
Fuji Ban. but the musical gentleman was
done at four furlongs, and Persuasion hit
the front with a good lead. She was passed
by Don Moon, who contrived to be much
nearer the leaders than he was in the
Challenge Stakes, and little Daniels skil
fully moved his mount, over to tin* rails. He
was tackled by Garrula and Horoscope, but
his courage and stamina stood to him; dead
tired, but dead game, lie reached the box
half a length in advance of Horoscope, who
THE GIRL WHO HAD A LITTLE ON.
was his own length in front of Garrula.
Pigeon Pie was fourth, Wedding Eve fifth,
Tleonui next and Waranton last; the time
was Imin. 421-sec. Grecian Orator fell three
furlongs from home and was killed outright,
but S. Davidson, who rode him, was not
badly hurt.
Don Moon has proved a rare bargain at
the 400 guineas which owner-trainer Bob
Bailie gave for him after the Don Reynaldo
—Full Moon gelding, then a three-year-old,
had unexpectedly won a seven-furlong handi-
cap at Rosehill last season. He has earned
nearly £6OOO in stakes for the man who used
to have David (the Doncaster prize was
worth £3118) ; and Bailie backed him sub-
stantially for Monday’s race, as also did
a pastoralist who follows his fortunes. Only
an ordinary customer to look at, Bailie’s bay
is all grit, and heavy going suits him, as
he showed in the Challenge Stakes, lie
mightn't have begun fast enough on a hrm
track.
Royal Feast maintained his Inch Victorian
reputation in the Sires' Produce Stakes,
seven furlongs. On the chance that the
going might bother the big fellow. McShort-
odds magnanimously called "Evens the field,
seven to one bar one.” but the massive son
of King Offa —Bunfeast won in a canter
from Prime Don (20 to 1) and The Wensum
(7 to 1), in Irnin. 82see., which, in the
circumstances, was pretty good time. Another
sterling performance was that of Limerick
(6 to 4 on) in the St. Leger. His stable-
companion, Battlement, was second favorite
at 5 to 1, and once in the straight the pair
came right away from the field, Limerick
winning, hard held, by a length and a half;
Thracian, the third horse, was 40 or 50 yards
behind Battlement. The time, 3min. 16£sec.,
was the slowest for many years, but Limerick
had a lot in reserve, and his Sydney Cup
price became shorter than ever.
Long before this the racing had become
trying to man, woman and beast. Never-
theless, most of the drenched crowd remained
to see the Tocal Handicap, in which eight
tired horses ploughed through bog and lake
water to the bitter end of 12 furlongs, left
behind in 2min. 48-1 sec. Bunkie (5 to 1)
did best and Tibbie (5 to 1) next best:
Three Kings (4 to 1) was a poor third and
Bacchus and Johnnie Jones (each 5 to 1)
finished “down the course.” Both may show
before the end of the meeting that the form
was wrong.
-X- * * *
Melbourne had the laugh on Sydney at
Ibe week-end, for the Weather on Easter
Saturday was delightful and there was a
vast multitude of punters at Epsom. On the
whole, they did better Ilian usual, as two
favorites scored, and the other winners, with
one exception, were well backed. T. M.
Burke’s Spearhead gelding Bombard, who
had won in good style at the previous Epsom
meeting, was always in most demand for
the Easter Handicap. 10 furlongs. He was
5 to 2 when the pencillers closed their bags;
Chickling and An an Louise were at half a
point longer. The outsider Bridge of Doon
(14 to 1) looked like doing it when he shot
to the front at the distance, but the favorite
put in a strong finish and downed him by
three-quarters of a length, while An an Louise
was a length and a half away. Bombard,
who was ridden by Scanlon, carried Sst.
Tib., and registered 2min. B£sec. He has 7st.
101 b. in the King’s Cup, 12 furlongs, at
Flemington next Saturday, and this Page
expects him to oblige Burke again. George
Harrison, sometime crack jockey, scored his
first success as an owner-trainer when his
Seremond —Gaie Coquette gelding Bon Aire
(3 to 1) took the Two-year-old in nice style
from Taraiti (4 to 1) and Duke Honor (7
to 4). There was a boil-over in the Open
Handicap, six furlongs, Sol Green’s cast-
off Coogee Bay (G to 4 on) being beaten halt
a neck by the much-improved Valoden (5 to
2) ; Translator (S to 1), well known on
Sydney courses, was a poor third.
* * * *
For a change the principal event at
Williamstown on Monday did not. go to a
member of the Spearhead family.. The club
had a perfect day for its meeting, and a
fairly good field, 13 in number, for its Easter
Cup, which provided some spirited betting;
it was 4 to 1 Eridanus, 9 to 2 Cady
Tattler, 5 to 1 Spear Maiden, 6 to 1 Long-
worthy, 7 to 1 Buffline and Duekshot. 14 to
1 Llanthony and others. No wonder McShort-
odds rides in Rolls-Royces. Imported
Buffline, with T. Lewis atop, won nicely for
C. *l. H. Stent from the ancient Llanthony,
and another old stager in Accarak (20 to 1),
the time being 2min. Ben Chaffey
supplied the winner of the Werribee Welter
in Pentola (15 to 1), by All Black out of
that good mare Gladwyn; this gelding just
beat Bedonia (25 to 1), who was once backed
for a Rosohill w.f.a. race against Gloaming.
And T. M. Burke’s Quintus (8 to 1), hero
of the 1924 Newmarket, carried topweight to
victory in the Federal Handicap. He is
lasting better than some other , sons of
\'a laix.

Those who made the trip to Oakbank on
Easter Monday for lhe Onkaparinga club s
annual meeting—and many thousands of
South Australians did—-witnessed some
11 1 rilling sport. Result after result was
in doubt till the numbers went up. Half
a neck was the margin by which Single
Tax. a warm favorite', beat Adit (also well
backed) in the Hurdle Race; a short head
separated Water Pistol (Pistol-Prnkrit I
from the Cyklou mare Vesuvius in the Onka-
paringa Cup ; there were short heads' between
first (Second Dale) and second (Phoenix)
and second and third (All Quality) in the
Hills Railway Stakes) ; and Rabneb, winner
of the Oakbank Welter, also got home by
a short head —to return £l7 11s. for £l, one
of the few substantial dividends declared.
Above all, the Great Eastern Steeplechase
ended in a dead-heat between Mt. Cooper,
last year’s winner, and Uuohoo, an outsider,
while the third horse, Epergne, one of tin;
Melbourne brigade, was only half a head
away. There has never been a more
exciting steeplechase, and the cheering—
which began when Mt. Cooper, who had
made all the running, entered the straight
slightly ahead of Epergne, who was two
lengths in front of Unolioo and Fortasse —-
was something to remember.
Mt. Cooper, who is owned by Fred Coffey
and was ridden by L. Shepard, paid £2 13s.
on the grandstand machine; Unolioo (owned
by A. J. Lord and ridden by D. Wraight)
earned £l3 Gs. for each £1 staked. Being
determined to make the Great Eastern the
richest steeple in Australia secretary Pull-
man and his committee hung up a prize of
£3OOO, or which Lord and Coffey collected
£1250 each, S. J. Casey, the owner of Epergne,
£3OO, and C. W. Leonard, who races For-
tasse, £2OO. The club has no regrets, though
it deserved a better acceptance than 15 at
£lO. Water Pistol’s victory in .the Onka-
paringa Cup was very popular, and not only
because he was well backed. One of the
owners is a member of the Yon Doussa
family, whose name will always be associated
with Onkaparinga.
The Worn-out Racehorse.
When great racehorses like Manfred, Wind-
hag and Valicare retire from the turf their
future is provided for, and no small por-
tion of glory awaits them. The same is true
of some animals a little below the Windbag
and Valicare class, especially such as are
stallions or mares. But a vast number of
good to middling horses, to say nothing of
“duds.” walk off their last racecourse into
obscurity. Many have earned large sums for
their owners. It would be natural to sup-
pose that these owners would allot a few
pounds to ensure their old slaves decent agist-
ment for the rest of their short lives, or at
least a merciful bullet to save them from
falling on evil days. One hears here and
there of such an owner, but lie is not nearly
as prevalent as he ought to be.
It is the old geldings, of course, that fare
worst. For minor-class stallions and mares
there is still some demand, but the geldings,
when used up for racing purposes, have no
further value save as nondescript workers,
though here and there one may catch the eye
of an Indian remount buyer or be adopted
as a trainer’s hack. In earlier days the
hansom-cab and the buggy found a use for
many a horse of this type. Light cart work
for butchers, bakers or milkmen absorbed
others, and though the work was often hard
there was food and, usually, decent attention.
Even on farms there was a demand for

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
“France and Germany played their first Rugby
t'nion match at Golombes Stadium on Saturday. Be-
fore the kick-off the French captain presented a
huge bouquet, of roses to the rival skipper. The
game, played in the prettiest spirit, of courtesy,
resulted in a win for France by 30 points to
Ring out, or whistle off, for good and all
The feud between the Teuton and the Gaul,
The memories that sodden and appal.
Football’s the king that enmities composes.
And when they met blown leather to pursue,
or hack that article the scrummage through.
Right down to when the knock-off signal
blew
Twas roses, roses, roses!
No Monsieur beat a Herr by feint or pace
Or tackled him with aught but courtly grace,
No bitter word, not e’en a sour grimace—
Such as when elbows hard impinge on
noses
Tender upon Australian fields is seen —
Marred this encounter Jules and Hans
between,
No wigs there were upon the Golombes green,
Just roses, roses, roses !
The player, grappled and turned upside-
down,
Arose without a soupgon of a frown ;
And the severity of things to crown,
The cream of it, in short, so one supposes,
Was that the very barrackers forbore
Their all-too-often wild tumultuous roar;
They cooed encouragement and nothing more.
Their flowers of speed were roses.
Hoch, Herr! And a voire saute, too,
Mossoo!
This game should usher in an era new,
And not alone because the twain of you
In rivalry that’s friendly it discloses.
A fascinating dream I entertain
Of days when football, purged of stormy
strain,
Shall be from Birmingham to (say) Bal-
main,
Just roses, roses, roses!

H. W. HARRISON,

; I
racehorses retired from business with
stamina- enough for a day’s work.
But the motor lias banished the hansom
and is fast superseding the tradesman’s cart.
On farms the tractor is doing all kinds of
work once performed by horses. The saddle-
hack is vanishing, too. In Britain the hunt-
ing kennels, the Continental horseflesh trade
and the cat’s-meat industry provide at least
sudden extinction and a funeral for the
unwanted racehorse. Here, in too many cases,
it seems to pay better to pass the one-time
money-spinner from hand to hand, on an
ever-decreasing scale, till his ultimate owner
turns him loose, as too worthless to feed, on
roadsides or waste lands, to die of starva-
tion.
Yet it doesn't seem impracticable for such
powerful and wealthy institutions as the rac-
ing clubs with headquarters in the Big Cities
to make some provision for played-out horses.
A tiny addition to acceptance fees or tin 1 like
would furnish a sufficient fund for ' the
destruction of the hopeless and the provision
of at least agistment for others. N.S.W.
lias the germ of such a scheme already, in
the excellent horse hospital and home for
convalescents which the S.P.C.A. maintains
in Sydney. The S.P.C.A. itself could not at
present cover such a wide field as that indi-
cated. But, with its success in the present
small undertaking to recommend it, a sub-
sidy from the big racing clubs would enable
it to extend its operations and (provided it
were willing) to establish a depot in every
State to alleviate what is, at present, a cry-
ing scandal to every genuine lover of a horse.
M.Q. (and Rafferty) Rules
Considering the weather and other circum-
stances, the pugs and the management were
lucky to get a £1650 “house” at the Sydney
Stadium on Saturday night, when Roy Moore,
the “Arizona Annihilator,” boxed “Sunny”
Jim Williams. Moore fought at his natural
weight, list. 61b., while the colored man had
to reduce greatly to make list. 91b. and save
a £IOO forfeit; in fact, the coon overdid it
and came in at list. 6flb. Seeing that he
was just on 13st. when he started training it
is not to be wondered at that Williams went
weak when the real stress of battle called for
every ounce of his strength. The black cut
out the pace, and for a time Moore cringed
along the ropes, making no effort to hit back.
The crowd hooted, and counted the pair out
several times during the first five rounds,
FOR A. GOOD BOY.
"Are you the jockey who rode the winning
horse?”
“Yes, Mum.”
"Well, I won ten shillings on it —and here’s
a shilling for yourself!”
while the referee repeatedly ordered Moore to
light. Stung by these reprimands, and decid-
ing (correctly) that his opponent had taken
a lot out of. himself by his desperate efforts
to batter a man who covers up like a snail in
its shell and clings on like a native bear, the
cowboy altered his tactics and took a vigorous
hand in the fighting. Soon the hoots changed
to hoorays; but even then the white man
fought only spasmodically, and Williams
landed heavy body blows. But he lacked the
strength and steam to make them as deadly
as they usually are, while every lashing lick
"f Moore’s told seriously. They were both
on their feet at the end of the 15th round,
when Wallis’s verdict went to Moore, and was
well received.
* * * *
"Frisco” McGale, who is only a welter-
weight and no champion at that, knocked
out Billy Edwards in seven rounds at Bris-
bane on Saturday. Edwards showed promise
until “Sunny" Jim Williams, with whom he
was unwisely matched, towelled him up at
Sydney Stadium; he has never seemed the
same lad since. After mixing scrap and
steel-making for some time, Edwards chucked
the latter and concentrated on scrap. A
return to steel seems highlv advisable.
* * * *
Though lie went hard for a k.o. in the
concluding rounds, Norman Gillespie, bantam
champion of Victoria, was clearly out-pointed
by Archie Cowan, from the Ma State’s South
Coast, in a 15-round contest at Melbourne
Stadium on Saturday night. Making effective
use of both hands, particularly a rapier-like
left, Cowan was ahead of the Victorian all
through. He has a future in the game if
he can develop a punch—boat-pulling, an old-
timer’s recipe, might do the business.
¥■ * * *
“Ben Cribb” : Masquerading as well-known
pugs, round remote country towns (B.
31/3/’27) is an old game. A lot of the
locals used to take a tumble, but that sport-
ing feeling, or fear of the possible conse-
quences of untimely revelations, usually
compelled the knowing ones to keep a shut
mouth. I can recall “Tommy Hanley” visit-
ing a N.Q. town in charge of Joe Grim.
The latter was the genuine unknockable dud
whom the ringsiders of fifteen years or so
ago will remember (the poor devil was
for a time in the Westralian asylum, and
ended his days in a U.S. institution), but
“Tommy” was far from true to label. The local
daily had a new reporter who affected much
ring knowledge. After watching a spar between
Joe and “Tommy” the expert announced that
Joe was as brainy as a billiard ball and as
slow as the arrival of a mining dividend,
while “Tommy” hadn’t the name blown ir.
the glass. That evening, on his way down
to write-up the pair, the expert graciously
accepted an invitation from Joe and his
manager to drink in the back parlor of
their pub. The landlord suddenly vanished;
the pressman found himself in a corner with
Joe and “Tommy” standing in front of him.'
“See here,” said one, “I’m fedder-weight
cliampeen, d’ye see?” “An’ I’m fast as da
lightnin’ an’ hit like-a da hell,” chimed in the
other, flourishing a fist like an old-time side-
saddle. The rapturous eulogy of the
gladiators that appeared in the next morn-
ing’s Northern Tin Scratchier must have
added twenty-five quid to the house.
Racquet and Bawl
The N.S.W. lawn-tennis championships
will open in Sydney on Saturday at the
Rushcutters Bay courts, after a match with
Queensland, to begin on Friday, has been
disposed of. Queensland is sending a “warm”
side, including E. F. Moon, and N. S. Wales
will have the services of F. E. Kalms. Strong
contingents are expected from Victoria and
South Aus.
* * * *
“Cash Amateur”: Following on the
decision of the International Lawn Tennis
Federation to allow each country to give
its own definition of amateurism, within
certain limits, Victoria has asked N. S.
Wales for an expression of opinion on what
constitutes an amateur. The N.S.W. execu-
tive may well get a headache over the job.
At present it is a party to an open infringe-
ment of one of the conceded general laws
of amateurism—that a professional and an
amateur may not play together or against
one another where gate-money is taken,
except in special cases where authority has
been obtained. Several leading N.S.W,
amateurs have been touring N.S.W. giving
exhibition matches to which admission fees
are charged, in conjunction with .1. O.
Anderson, a declared professional. Trouble
may come of this in countries whose rules
as to amateurism are less easy-going than
ours. Wimbledon, for example, is not
unlikely to raise an inquiring eyebrow over
the entry fdrm of an amateur who has been
stumping the country playing public matches
with and against a professional.
“Gwed Odds”: According to the Council
of the English Lawn Tennis Association,
“the employee of any manufacturer, agent,
or retailer of tennis requisites should forfeit
his amateur status if playing in tournaments
as a condition of his employment; it is
undesirable that players engaged in the sale
or manufacture of tennis racquets or balls
should be selected to represent England.”
If all that went in Australia, it would be
a case of “Where are our ehee-ampeens ?”
* * * *
“15-30”: Interest in the feminine singles
at Wimbledon this year will be doubled by
the announced invasion of Helen Wills, last
photographed wearing a pensive expression
over _ a formidable rhyming dictionary.
Helen’s decision to go in for poetry, as a
counterblast to Suzanne Lenglen’s industry
in the composition of serials, has not affected
her tennis, which she has kept in good trim
by solid practice. Those most likely to give
her trouble at Wimbledon are the U’Alvarez
girl, Mile. Vlasto and Mrs. Godfree, formerly
Kitty McKane, who has captured the singles
once and the mixed doubles twice, with her
husband as partner. Mrs. Godfree will
probably prove the American girl's toughest
problem. Somewhat, buxom, Kitty has solid
underpinnings and the courage of a Digger
in a tighi place. Her steady stroke-produc-
tion will often upset the strategy of a
quicker thinker, and she has always the
advantage of being in the pink of condition.
She loves games for health’s sake; failing
tennis during the dubious English winter,
she keeps herself active by playing Badmin-
ton, at which she has already won two or
three trophies. She and her husband, with
Austin, Kingsley and Gregory, propose paying
a visit to Australia.
* * * *
Perth had some star performers from this
side of the continent for the lawn-tennis
tournament it stages at Easter. O’Hara
Wood clinched a fine showing by beating E.
T. Rowe in straight sets in the final of the
singles, after outing .T. Willard, the N.S.W.
WONDERFUL INDEED!

minium racer ): “Wonderful wot a feller can make

rep. The Westralians were delighted with
the form of Rice Gemmell against Rowe in
the semi-finals, the local man taking a set
from the South Australian and making him
put forth his utmost skill in the other sets.
Car and Cycle
There is so little that is new in the motor
section at this year’s Sydney Show that it
would seem the automobile has got some-
where near the state of perfection reached
by the bicycle a quarter of a century ago.
The proportion of closed cars continues to
grow, and there are evidences that the
Americans are paying more and more atten-
tion to export needs. Cars of tlie short
compact type, pioneered in U.S. by the
Overland “Whippet,” are now finding a place
in many a Yankee maker’s catalogue. Low
running cost and convenience in parking are
making for these an American market, but
they trench on an export field that hitherto
English and Continental manufacturers have
had to themselves. More luxury in springing,
gadgets for delaying cooling while the engine
warms up in warm weather, little conveni-
ences of body-furnishing, and some cute ideas
in wind-screens about sum up the really new
features. Unorthodox ensrine designs are
fading away. Only one real innovation —
the Knight sleeve-valve arrangement—con-
tinues to hold the field, and it’s at least 15
years old.
* #v * *
“Chug-chug”: While comparatively few
drivers go in for track-racing, it’s quite the
thing in this country, as in others, for
youth, gilded or otherwise, to take the road
in a ’bus which, bar the mudguards, looks
as if it ought to have a big number stuck
up prominently somewhere around it.
Mostly these shiny fish-tailed contraptions
can’t hit 60 save on a down grade with
the wind behind, and it’s a good thing they
can't, because when Peter is out to impress
Joan he takes a lot of chances. But they
come out strong on noise. They generally
have an exhaust cutout, and keep it per-
manently in service, so that the snappy
two-seater of 11.9 R.A.C. rating gives a
fine imitation of a triple-engined bombing-
plane in a big hurry to blow something up.
“Lytt”: Car-drivers are getting soft and
pampered. An English trade journal which
collected a symposium of private-owners’
wants found they craved easier lubrication,
easier starting, a means of adjusting the
springs from the driver’s seat, bright parts
that will stay bright, an automatic jack, and
tyres that will repair themselves. They can
get all those things to-day if they are pre-
pared to pay, with the exception of the
automatic jack, which presumably is a thing
that will know’ intuitively whether the car
has stopped because the run is finished or
because something has gone w’rong. Six
shots with a grease-gun at very infrequent
intervals is all that modern cars need, and
with the more expensive sort all one has to
do is to drive into a service station and let
an assistant fill up whatever is empty. As
to easier starting—-well, at present one
presses a button, and if the batteries haven’t
run out the car starts. And modern tyres,
if one doesn’t let them wear right through
the fabric, only puncture under very great,
provocation. People who expect to get trans-
port without grooming their chariot at all
really need a chauffeur.
* X- * *
“Duudula” : An exhibit (not for competi-
tion ) at a recent Queensland show was a
collection of over 80 articles, mostly tools
of various sorts and sizes, arranged in a
glass-covered case. In the centre of the
case was a dagger about 20in. in length,
and displayed symmetrically round it were
hammers, pliers, a screwdriver, a bread-
knife, a corkscrew, a couple of keys like
those used for winding large clocks, screws
of various designs, and a few small drills.
And they were all made from scraps of Ford
cars picked up on the district roads.
* * * *
“Battlement”: Every British motor-trade
journal that one can pick up nowadays con-
tains a disquisition on what
Engl i s h manufacturers
ought to do to capture the
Dominions’ market. 11
oughtn’t to be difficult to
discover. It’s open to any
English maker to peruse the
sales statistics of the Aus-
tralian, Canadian and S’Afri-
can markets, to find out
which Yankee cars sell best,
and benefit by the informa-
tion. At present the average
lankee maker can turn out
a six-cylinder car—which is
what every sophisticated
motorist overseas wants —
at about two-thirds the price,
half the weight and twice
the usefulness on bad roads
or no roads compared with
the average British effort.
Britain is so well roaded
that it is a wonder the Brit-
ish cars are built so heavy.
Their redeeming virtue —a
life of ten years or more compared with
the Yankee aim of a three-years’ run —
doesn’t cut much ice in a catalogue.
* * * *
Australian motorists are focussing atten-
tion on the Y.M.C.A. motor-’bus trip from
Port Pirie (S.A.) to Brisbane, which began
on April 9. The route out runs through
Broken Hill, Wilcannia, Bourke, Walgett,
Goondiwindi and so to Brisbane. The return
journey will be by way of the Darling
Downs, down the Hunter River country and
through southern N.S.W. to Melbourne, and
then on to Port Pirie again. It is an ambi-
tious stunt, but the Reo car which is to
carry the big load of 20. passengers on the ;
long trail is expected to do its job without
any unnecessary fuss.
* * * *
“M.L.”: One of the worst blooms of the
bike-racing craze of tlie beginning of the
century was the six-days’ race. It started
out as a sort of pedal Marathon in which
NO TEMPTATION.
HE: “Do gnu find it hard to avoid pressing?”
SHE: “ No.-[?]: the men are a slow lot down
here.”
individuals sought to discover how much
sleep they could do without, and then, in
deference to the S.P.G.A. and the police,
became a show in which teams of two altern-
ated the dreary round. Every year or two
there is a recrudescence of the thing in
Sydney—there was one last week —-but. even
periodical sprints can’t make it exciting.
There was a shred of excuse for the business
in the days when military despatch rider;
were sometimes sent, out on bicycles, 1. .
those days are gone beyond recall.

The Pertli-Fremantle footballers open their
season on Saturday, a week ahead of their
confreres of Adelaide and Melbourne. The
Westralian season will be a big one in every
way, for the Collingwood club will visit
Perth in August what time the Jarrahland
team is away at the inter-State “carnival"
in Melbourne. Westralia scored on points
in the inter-State meetings last year, and is
keen on vanquishing Victoria, which carried
away the honors at the 1924 “carnival,” held
at Ilobart. The Vic.-W.A. struggle on that
occasion was about the most thrilling in the
history of the game.
* * * *
“Rucker”: One of the drawbacks with
which Australian-rules football has had to
battle in Sydney has been the difficulty of
maintaining a junior grade as a feeder for
the senior clubs. A step forward has been
made with the leasing of Jubilee Oval for
the use of the newly formed Junior League,
for hitherto the youngsters have been poorly
served in the matter of grounds. What is
needed now is the institution of district
junior competitions; South Sydney has set
a worthy example. Also the Melbourne people
should have at least one of their premiership
matches played in Sydney—on the Sports
Ground, say, if the S.C.G. can’t be got. A
Fitzroy-Collingwood or Geelong-South Mel-
bourne tussle w y ould help the code immensely
in these parts.
* * * *
“Flagwagger”: Though Footscray is only
commencing its third season in the Melbourne
League, it has had four coaches. Con
McCarthy was the first; he came from Col-
lingwood in 1922, when ’Scray was an Asso-
ciation club. Under Con’s coaching and
leadership on the field ’Scray won two pre-
mierships and beat Essendon, the League
premiers. However, following the club's
entry into the League in 1925, fortune ceased
to smile, and Con learnt that those who
cheer to-day will condemn to-morrow. When
1926 arrived, Jim Cassidy, an old player and
a member of the training staff, was appointed
coach at £4 10s. a week, McCarthy continu-
ing as captain. But ’Scray’s ill-success con-
tinued, and both coach and captain resigned.
Sam Saunders, from Collingwood, was then
appointed coach, and Allan Hopkins was
elected captain. Early this year the club
advertised for a playing coach, and Paddy
Scanlon, of South Melbourne, got the job at
£9 a week. As there is better material on
tlie training list than has been the case for
years, Paddy may be more successful than his
predecessors. But there is a fly in the oint-
ment. Allan Hopkins may be re-elected cap-
tain. And no club can hope for success with
two bosses on the field.

A. W. Ross, depicted here, is one of the
finest Rugby full-backs Australia has pro-
duced. Sydney Grammar discovered him, and
the All Blacks got a taste of his quality last
year. Ross will be the first man picked for
the N.S.W. XV to tour England. As a hard-
hitting batsman and a capital field, he has
been serviceable to the Sydney Uni. cricket
team. The photo is by Melba Studios, which
were also responsible for rowing coach Ossie
Wood’s picture (B. 31/3/’27).
* * * *
“Gate”: The English Rugby League
Council has taken a step of some interest
to the Australasian followers of the game
by approving the formation of an Imperial
Rugby League Board. This will consist,
of three members, one for England and one
each representing Australia and M.L. The
Yorkshire and Lancashire Leagues, which
comprise all England’s League players, will
hand over the joint control of the game they
have hitherto exercised to the Rugby League
Council, which will look after that end
of the business. The “Imperial” Board
will attend to matters affecting overseas
players. The title of the new board sounds
a trifle ambitious, seeing that the League
game, outside England, is only played in
two Australian States and a fragment of
M. Still, the Rugby Union has instituted
a Dominions organisation, and the pro-
fessional code must keep pace or hurst.
* * * *
“Gate” : N.S.W. Rugby League has decided
to appoint live .selectors in lieu of three, the
idea being that a wider range of matches
can thus be covered. It has been tried be-
fore, in all codes, and it lias invariably been
found that the bigger the selection committee
the more confused the issue at the finish.
Even three selectors get in each other's way
at times. The perfect ideal is the sole
selector. But he must be one in a million,
combining knowledge with impartiality and
a sense of responsibility. The most success-
ful “sole” the writer ever knew was the late
F. C. Lea, of Queensland, who for years
maintained a just balance in all things and
rarely had his selections called in question.
* * * *
“Stand Off”: A feature of the Queens-
land League season has been the resuscita-
tion of the Past Grammar club. In the
days of the Rugby Union, the P.G., re-
cruited from the old boys of Brisbane
Grammar School, 'was one of the most
famous Rugby clubs in Australia. It won
many premiersliips and has at least one
clear-cut victory over N.S.W. to its credit,
besides contributing solidly to the represen-
tative sides, year in and out. A lot of old-
timers will be sorry to see the name appear-
ing in League competitions, more especially
as the club’s players will now rank as pro
fessionals wherever the Amateur Federa-
tion holds sway.
* * * *
“Slovitz”: Westralian Soccer people are
ransacking bookshops and libraries in search
of Czecho-Slovak vocabularies. For the Czecho-
slovak footballers, whose names mostly sound
like the expiring gasp of a soda-syphon, are
due in Perth on May 3, and there is no time
to be wasted. Players will naturally be han-
dicapped if they can’t make their visiting-
opponents understand the pointed remarks
which adorn every game of footer, whatever
the code, and barrackers unable to launch the
winged darts expected of them will feel that
life is a blank for the time being. If only
one of the many Czeclio-Slav immigrants now
in Australia has wit and English enough to
start a C.-S.-Ehglish correspondence class, he
should make a punch.
The Ins and Outs
Ivo Bligli, Btli Earl of Darnley, who died
in his Kentish home last week, gained cricket
immortality as the first “custodian of the
ashes,” to use a worn-out tag of journalese,
tie captained the English XI which visited
Australia in 1882-83, after Australia had
won the famous match at Ivennington Oval.
Though England and Australia tied, each
winning two of the four Tests, the “ashes”
were presented to Bligli in an urn, and
remained in his possession, to become the
most accursed of sporting cliches. An
Etonian and Cantab, Bligh was a leading
lawn-tennis player in his earlier days. A
“barked” finger at Melbourne Cricket Ground
led to one of the romances of cricket, since
the Victorian girl who hastily offered her
handkerchief to staunch the bleeding after-
wards became the Countess of Darnley.
“I.B.” was 68 when stumps were drawn.
* * * *
“Topee”: T’.e Earl of Darnley that was
had the longest feet I’ve ever seen on a
cricket pitch, Tate’s and Fred Hack’s not
excepted. For years sizes 12 and upwards
were known in the trade as “Ivo Blighs.”
“Howzatt”: The proposal to send an
Australian cricket XI to tour India having-
been turned down by the Board of Control,
it. is likely that Frank Tarrant, the ex-
Victorian and Middlesex all-rounder, may
take a side over. Tarrant, long associated witii
India as a cricketer and horse-buyer, has
the freedom of the country, so to speak. Such
a tour would be enjoyable in every way, and
Tarrant should have no trouble in getting
a good side together. But then will come
the question of permission from the Board
of Control. With individual players and the
N. Association at variance with the
omnipotents, there are all the materials for
brewing a pretty row.
Adelaide’s first-grade cricket season finished
last week, when Kensington, with which
L. V. Pellew and J. W. Rymill play, beat
Port Adelaide by 82 runs. Pellew (77)
and Rymill (64) were backed up by J. R.
Fuller (80) in Kensington’s score of 324.
Port Adelaide’s reply was 242, which
included a fine 114 from Curtin’s bat. Wil-
liams, the Sheffield Shield rep., bowled mag-
nificently for Port, taking 7 for 165 in 25
overs. Kensington, now winners of the Walsh
Cup, have been first-graders for only four
years.
* * * *
“Centurion”: Hendry slipped badly in
Maoriland when he said a slow howler was
needed in Australia. Grimmett, long in the
tooth, is not nearly a spent force. Williams,
of South Aus., only came into his own
during the season now ending, after knock-
ing at the door for some time. Perhaps, the
best slow bowler w r e have is Ronnie Oxen-
ham, of Queensland, who has shown that
ho can get wickets cheaply, and make cen-
turies. too. in first-class company. But Oxen-
ham is not a “bosie.”
The Nineteenth Hole
“Divot Digger” : Freak golf is seldom heard
of in Australia ; one must go to America to
find its highest expression. The latest devel-
opment there is the case of one Graham, who
has wagered he will drive a golf ball from
New York to Hollywood, via incw Orleans,
which is something equivalent to driving from
Cairns to Melbourne, via Brisbane and
Sydney. Graham lately reached San An-
tonio in Texas with a card of 36,280 strokes.
Warm hospitality there led the wanderer
to forget the previous day's tally of strokes
when he woke up next morning, and lie had
to go back 20 miles and play the hole again.
He plays from the local golf club tee to the
first hole in the club of the town he arrives
at, and each club registers his score. It
says a lot for the prevalence of golf clubs
in America that his distance between holes
has proved comparatively short so far. He
hopes to hole out at Hollywood in June
next, by which time he should have worn
out a few balls, to say nothing of clubs.
“Flog”: Manly has been lax about naming-
special holes in its course, though it boasts
one “Mount Everest”; but the 15th hole,
a mere mashie-niblick shot of 102 yards, has
been called every name in the golfing vernacu-
lar. It is a small island surrounded by a
sea of bunker, and the lofted shot that fails
to reach the green is sunk without trace. The
sand is so fine and deep in' the main bunker
that caddies are stationed on look-out duty
to mark the spot where the ball disappeared
beneath the sand. The player is allowed to
uncover the top of his ball, so that it can
be seen ; but the second shot is difficult to
“explode,” and there is always the chance
of it disappearing into the lagoon beyond
the green. Already the trees sheltering the
green have a blasted look.
* * * *
“Amateur Pro.”: The U.S. Golf Associa-
tion has ruled that Mary Browne, the tennis
player who turned professional at the same
time as Suzanne Lenglen, is ineligible to
play golf as an amateur. This is going a
long way further than British or Australian
rule or practice. Almost anyone can play
the royal and objurgatory game as an
amateur, provided he or she doesn’t take
money for playing or teaching, and is not
engaged in manufacturing or selling golf
material. This last dates back to the days
when making and selling clubs, balls, etc.,
was practically a monopoly of the profes-
sionals. and affected no one else. It is not
too strictly interpreted nowadays, otherwise
a big proportion of Australian business men
would lose their amateur status as golfers.
Miscellaneous
“Green Chequer”: The homing pigeon is
a temperamental cow, if one may apply
such an expression to a fowl, and this trait
sometimes leads to great agony of mind in
his owner. All fanciers know the bird that
won’t “clock in” when he comes in from
a race, but loafs round on an adjacent tree
or chimney-pot, telling the girls how he
knocked the feathers out of the hawks on
his fly home. A friend entered some of his
birds at the Sydney Show, paying fees in
advance. The evening they were to be
borne to Moore Park they took offence at
the family washing, hung out near their
loft, and, after a stopwork meeting on a
near-by housetop, declined to enter their
abode. Their maddened owner, blaspheming
as lie thought of his wasted entrance-money,
was ignored, and the whole mob spent the
night on the tiles. I went over next morn-
ing on the chance of a few dead pigeons
for a pie. but they were still on the roof
when their owner departed for work, with
murder in his heart.
* * * *
“Topee”: Coming down the Parramatta
River on a late Saturday afternoon, I con-
trasted its quietness with the bustle of 40
or 50 years ago. In those days even
if a match was not being pulled off one
could always meet aspiring Trieketts prac-
tising. “Black” Charlie Reynolds, the
quarryman, w r as a popular coach, and his
“Dip ’em, you cows, dip ’em!” could have
been heard from Ryde to Five Dock. A
venerable fruit-boat, the Growers’ Friend,
could be chartered for 50s. as umpire’s boat,
and at 2s. a head the “gate” would often
make a decent addition to the stake. I
remember once following a £2O event in
which both contestants had sold the race.
They were so palpably “dead” that the
umpire issued a monitory address from the
bow of the Growers’ Friend. “If yon want
me to shove you along,” he roared, “say so;
but if you don’t get a move on I’ll cry the
race off!” At this one sculler promptly fell
out of his boat. Before his opponent could
follow suit the umpire had carried out his
threat.

The lean, lithe oarsman whom the camera-
man has caught is 11. A. Schlieliting, who
will stroke the Victorian eight in the inter-
state race for the King’s Cup at Hobart
on May 7. Stroke of Melbourne club, he has
been one of the outstanding oarsmen in
Victoria for a couple of seasons past and
Victorians are confident that he and his
crew will revive the State’s old glories
in the inter-state championships.
“Slide”: Apparently Paddy Hannan
hasn’t much chance of meeting Major Good-
sell in the world’s champion sculls (B.
7/4/’27). H. A. Barry, a nephew of Arthur
of that ilk who beat Australia’s Felton on
the Parramatta, has first claim. He chal-
lenged Goodsell some time ago, and the lat-
ter has now accepted. Barry asks for a
date in July or August, and wants to row
on the Parramatta. Nevertheless, he is
willing to row in California, where the
Australian is now living.
* * * *
“Eurilla” (Cambridge) : There were
seven Australians in the Oxford v.
Cambridge lacrosse match, won by Oxford,
and there would have been eight had not
pneumonia put one under for the time being.
J. L. Bonython, the Cambridge captain, and
Dr. M. L. Formby, who led the Oxford lads,
are both from St. Peter’s College, Adelaide;
Bonython also skippered Cambridge when it
beat Oxford (captained by R. R. Sholl. of
Melbourne) in the Australian-rules football
match in November. That game, though
lively, was spoiled by a fog, which was so
bad that one goalkeeper could not see the
other; in fact, at times centres could not
see either goal. Touching Australian
captains : Dr. D. J. R. Sumner, of Adelaide,
captained Oxford’s tennis team last year.
This year J. B. Bell, of Geelong, is secretary
of Cambridge Boat Club, and G. H. Grim-
wade, of Melbourne, captains the Cambridge
golfers.
* * * »
“Ormskirk” : Sydney was to have had ite
first squint at mechanical-hare coursing at
Epping on Saturday night, but something
went wrong with the works and the meeting
was postponed. When everything is in going
order cruelly-deceived greyhounds will be
released in batches of eight to pursue the
electrical quarry they can never hope to
catch. The aim of the individual who elec-
trically controls the hare from a high tower
is to keep it just in front of the noses of
the straining hounds. The show is really
a dog-race, prizes being awarded on past-
the-post positions, as in horse-racing. “The
whippets” were popular in Kalgoorlie till
night trotting superseded them; whether
Sydney w T ill take to the new style of dog-
racing (especially as night trotting is to
be introduced, thanks to the Labor Govern-
ment’s zeal for the workers) is problem-
atical.
* * * *
“Pot th’ White”: A Bulletin writer
recently remarked that as soon as rules
restricting interminable billiard scores were
made, the professionals who live by playing
exhibition games set themselves to find a
way of evading them. Tom Reece, that
amiable cannon artist whom Australia once
knew well, is the latest to confirm the
theory ; in a match against Inman he has
hung the rule prohibiting more than 25 con-
secutive direct cannons on the peg. Working
the balls into the jaw of the right top pocket.
Tom played -the “anchor” shot from each
side alternately. Before reaching his 25
limit, however, he played a shot off the
cushion, which gave the necessary cannon
and position, while breaking the sequence
of 25 “direct” cannons. In that way Reece
made a 1151 break.

This Easter Sydney has been under the
weather —over 10i million tons of liquid
refreshment was poured out for it on Satur-
day alone, not to mention aaJiolc lakes on
Good Friday and Holy Thursday and the
dourness of Easter morn Avhicli turned into
torrents of tears in the afternoon. "Nothing
like it for over 13 years,” reports the weather
man. The Show has been a deserted A illage,
and on Saturday Raindrops won all the
eA r ents at Randwick —the opening day of the
A.J.C. races had to be postponed. The
Harbor, too, fretted in its cage, and hurled
itself in the way of the little ferries,
till the Manly and Balmoral services had to
be suspended. The shops Avere open on
Saturday, but the only things sold were rain-
coats, goloshes and umbrellas. This Letter
saw a tall country man outfitting his six
kiddies, his Avife and himself. First the
youngsters were goloshed and cloaked; then
herself Avas rubbered from heel to head;
then himself. After which he took the two
youngest by the hand, she gave a hand apiece
to the next two, while the oldest
pair solemnly clasped each other's hand, and
the family party made for the street —and
the flood.
On Thursday the Renown, with the Royal-
ties all snug below the hatches, made for the
open sea and Hobart while the heavens
Avent into liquidation over the parting. It
really was one of the Avettest days in the
civic records, and it all hut flooded out
the Duke and Duchess as, true to promise,
they made their Avay from the Brisbane train
to the Show. Fortunately it wasn’t till the
afternoon that the ring was under water,
and the Duke and Duchess saw a bit of the
glories of the beef and brawn that help to
build up the Empire. Some splendid riding,
too, brought a gleam to the Ducal eye.
By Thursday afternoon even the most con-
firmed Show addict found a leak in his
enthusiasm, and by four o’clock the jaunty
kiosks and ornate pavilions were steadily
emptying sodden humanity into the city-
bound trams. On Friday the attendance,
which on last year’s record should have
passed 170,000, failed to reach 08,000; and
on Saturday it fell to 10,000. Then the
committee met and decided to keep the
gates open till the end of the current
Aveek.
In spite of the grey threat of Monday
morning, Randwick drew its thousands, and
the Doncaster was run before a massed
troglodyte audience which peered from the
cavernous depths of the stands at mud-
splashed horses and riders. Rain-coated,
gaitered and goloshed for the most part,
women splashed about between the races.
Some were furred from ankle to chin, and
such spent the entire afternoon in the shelter
of the stands, betting, collecting and drinking
tea. One girl sported a coat of what a
female admirer declared to be unborn calf;
another wore a red-leather coat, first cousin
to one that a fashionable shop is giving away
for twenty pounds. Mrs. Sep Levy was
submerged in sable, or something very close
to it. The much-travelled American, Mrs.
Willoughby Rodman, cousin to the mellow
old Admiral who made friends with us during
the American Fleet visit, added a lettuce
green hat to the stand’s melee. Mrs. Sydney
Jamieson showed her newly-returned-from-
Europe profile above the vice-regal board at
luncheon ; and Lady de Chair wore the del-
phinium blue costume in which she greeted
Royalty a tW Saturdays ago, topped by a
full-length fur coat.
The Renown officers had time to thoroughly
digest their dinner before their guests arrived
at the ship’s farewell ball. Not until nine
o’clock did the first ferry from the Quay
wallow to the fray. Everybody, civic, mili-
tary and naval, who has been at the other
functions turned up, the Avomen showing
a new haircut or wave and a mess of pearls
through the aperture in their eAening
wraps.
Awminged in red and white, with amber
and creme, de menthe lanterns coquetting
with the ordinary electrics, the ship was
Mars masquerading as a jester. This im-
mense white deck, which, cleared for action,
is just: a floating platform for thundering
guns, reverberated with the atrocious boom
of loud-speakers bowdlerising in repetition
the fine music made by the band under the
eye of two stern drummer-boys. From a
pinnace spinning towards it through the
moonlit waters, the vessel was a nebulous,
palpitating, sybaritic goal; but once there—
well, as Euclid has remarked, every dance
in a warship is the same dance in the same
warship. The State Ex. and his lady must
have been massaging their own ballroom
floor nightly, for their steps displayed quite
a bit of pace, and Lady de Chair, who took
the floor first with Captain Sullivan, added
a becoming mixture of green and silver sea-
soned with pearls and top-dressed with
diamonds to the whirl. Sir Dudley led out
Mrs. Robins, wife of the Captain of the
1 ’ort; and Priminister Bruce later steered
both the ladies through the maze.
Pretty Pamela Watt is in Sydney again.
Almost reverend did father Ernest look be-
tween sliy-eyed Pauline and gold-topped
Pamela. Tall and fair, Mrs. Stanham
caught the eye in white georgettes covered
by an ermine coat. Mrs. Tony Hordern’s
burgundy velvet was fascinating. Rosemary
Shepherd’s bright gaze added to the illumina-
tions of the night; Mollie Street swirled in
the midst of a blue lagoon fashioned of lush
silk fringe ; and Mrs. Lambert Latham (who
was actress Nellie Payne) was silvered o’er.
All the sophisticated frocks were golden-
browns and leaf-browns, and one of the most
notable of them was worn by Margaret
Osborne. Mrs. Dranstick!, in black lace lit
by diamonds, came with the Colonel Cox-
Taylor couple. Mrs. Pat Levy, in sky-blue,
and Mayoress Mostyn, in orchid georgettes,
were others in the throng.
Because of the Renown lying off Kirri-
billi, dancing Sydney seems to have regarded
it as Holystone rather than Holy Week.
There were one-steps every night except Good
Friday, all in some degree or other to the
glory of the warship and her men. Of these
frivols the Young Australia League flutter
was in the blue-ribbon class. Named the
Renown Farewell, it was skippered and
engineered by men in about the time it takes
most committees to get to the point of won-
dering whether they ought to give stout or
lobster for the lucky balloon prizes. It was
a whale of a success. The Wentworth blazed
Avith lights and rocketed with enjoyment.
There were over 1500 struggling for foot-
hold at the same time; there was a fragrant
bunch of debs.; there were English officers
(and they’re awfully nice when you speak
the language) ; there were the smiling State
vice-regals; there were the Mayor and his
lady; there was Captain Sullivan of the
Pinafore—or is it RenownV The dressing
was like a succession of strong drinks, each
outfit more intoxicating than the last. The
vice-reine, in old rose and silver brocades
plentifully sprinkled with pearls and dia-
monds, was surrounded by Mrs. Hay (white
georgette bestrewn with blue crescents),
Mrs. Armitage (the green of Erin) and Mrs.
Harry Budge, whose red velvet and yellow
ostrich wrap suggested some gay little exotic
bird.
The laughing lady in this Dayne picture
is Mrs. Rayner, who was responsible for
the display of
k i n dergarten
work in the
Town Hall last
week. Six hun-
dred children
were as good
as gold under
her stage-man-
aging a n d
under the eye
of sympathetic
teachers. There,

dies whose kin-

named, bnt are just as happy in their results,
played merrily, worked contentedly with
colored chalks or beads or dolls, or went on a
wild spree with mugs of milk. The pretty show
was to stimulate interest in the Kinder-
garten Union; and its success is due to the
tireless elf or Is of the lady alongside.
The canteen for the sailors has been one
of the Quay’s bright spots for the past fort-
night, and late Harbor travellers will miss
the cheerful twinkle of its electrics. Seated
at its white oil-clotlied tables, .Tack, imbibing
ice-cream or vacuuming meat-pies, turned an
ear more or less attentive to the classical
programmes which some of the entertainers
prepared for him. When he'd listened long
enough he quietly slipped away to the other
end of the big wharf building, and got busy
with a gramophone. What he liked most of
all was a sing-song by his pals, and it wasn’t
unusual for one of the sailors to step up to
the platform briskly, just as a celebrated
tenor had died away in love and roses, and
smash the calm with a regular typhoon of
song. .Tack Cannot made a great hit, and it
was generally agreed that “he orter be on
the ’alls.” Captain Sullivan dropped in the
night before the Renown sailed away and
handed out picture post-cards of his ship.
It’s the nearest view many of the workers
had of it.
Melba, banked with flowers and glittering
with diamonds and decorations, sang her
farewell at_ the Town Hall last week. An
amazing Melba, avlio looked somewhere in
the blooming forties, and imbued her flesh
pink and ivory georgettes with a scintillating
life that many a thirty is incapable of! Her
good-bye speech was made Avith a sturdiness
that rejected sentimentalities. And here you
glimpsed the strength by which an unknown
Australian had conquered Europe. Hers is
not a spirit to spend itself in tears over
past glories. She may have made us gasp
at times, but there was nobody in that vast
audience who didn’t feel proud of this in-
domitable Australian.
Four and a half years ago Elioth Gruner
Avas up beyond Inverell, sketching. At the
farm where he was living he noticed some
fine w ate r-
colors, and
learned they
were the Avork
of the farmer’s
so u. Gruner
thought so
much of the
paintings that
he strongly adr
\ 7 ised the boy,
Douglas Dun-
das, to go to
Sydney. But
Douglas could
not afford to
study art all
day. He had
his living to
make. How-
ever, he joined
Julian As h-
ton’s arm y,
then looked for
work, an d
found it at Farmer’s. Gradually he became
a showcase dresser; and every evening and
every week-end he pursued Art. The other
day Bernard Hall and George Lambert
declared his work the best submitted for the
Society of Artists’ Travelling Scholarship;
and now for two years Douglas Dnndas—-
his picture is alongside—is free to study
Art full time in Europe.
The moths haven’t had a chance of a
decent bite out of Sydney’s evening clothes
this mad, merry fortnight. The Kinder-
garten Union dance was a perfectly good
excuse for the expensively-clad of the city
to pour into the Ambassadors. Dances and
suchlike have become almost epidemic since
Mayor Mostyn Came to the Civic throne.
Now, Mr. Mostyn belongs to the Electrical
Workers’ Union, and this Better senses a
deep-laid plot somewhere. _ Anyway, the
Mayor and his lady were again early comers
and late stayers. The vice-regals, too, were
steady dancers all through the night. Lady
de Chair’s satins shone w T ith the translucence
of green waters, her ears were hung with
fringed rings, and her hair was banded with
diamonds. Silver-chased black georgettes
enwrapped Mrs. Beatrice McDonald, the cap-
able organiser of the success. Gold-shod
went Mrs. Sep Levy, and black and silver
at their best clothed vice-president Mrs.
Stewart Dawson. Margaret Osborne, lily
fair in pink and silver; Biddy Tallis, pinkly
fringed in a group of Melbourne visitors,
and three blushing debs, were among the
night’s attractions.
No end of fuss is being made because a
Widow lady, the daughter of a millionaire
brewer, has, on her way back to England,
told a Ceylon newspaper that Australians are
uncouth, graceless, ignorant people who treat
the good XXX immigrant as though he were
yesterday’s ginger-beer. Several explana-
tions of the outburst have been offered, in-
cluding one which this Letter’s _ own corres-
pondent at Trincomalee secured in the course
of an interview. She beams
The Dame nodded moodily as she blew the froth,
off a pint-pot on the table before her.
“Yes,” she replied, “it's a God-forsaken wilderness
filled with barbarians insensible to the finer things
of civilisation.”
“You surprise me!” I said in a pained tone.
The Dame flung one chiffon silk knee over the
other, whistled up the waiter, and indicating her
own empty pewter and including me with a courteous
jerk of the thumb, we were soon supplied with the
elements of the perfect interview. Peering into
the amber depths, she whispered in an ecstasy: “It’s
McEwan’s!” Then, suddenly banging her measure
down on the table, with outraged pride she spat
into my ear: “And you never see its label in Aus-
tralia!”
She mused in silence for fixe minutes. Then, in
a voice that seemed to labor under a thick collar
of froth, she said: “Imagine a continent two-thirds
of which is a. parched desert, and you can picture
the rosy hopes with which I left, my native shore,
‘lt will be a long way from home,’ I said to myself,
‘but McEwan’s will be there!’ Think, then of the
bitterness of the discovery that scarcely a drop of
McEwan’s bottle or draught irrigates the thirsty
land. Take Sydney, their principal- village. On
arrival I looked about, and entered a historic: hostelry
known as the First and Last. Here, I must say, a
sort of rough hospitality prevailed; I was soon
invited six times to stop one, but always the call
was for Resch’s or Tooth’s, two horrible local-brews.
“Rushing from that uncouth company without so
much as the flavor of one hop to support me, I made
my way into some of those bottle and jug depart-
ments that do so much to give a city Character. But
things were no better here; for half a day I waited
and did not hear a single call for McEwan’s pale.
Happily I was not far from the Quay. Calling a
taxi, I sprang aboard an outgoing steamer, and —
and here I am, an angry, disillusioned dame.”
“Have you anything to say about Birthstains ?” I
murmured, licking my pencil; “it is generally done.”
But the Dame was absorbed lovingly removing the
label from one of the Firm’s bottles.
The Arthur Allens’ ballroom at Merioola
housed the ouly private party of any dimen-
sions spread for the Renown officers. The
captain and other nabobs were bidden to the
affair, which was lavish of decoration and
supper. The vice-regals, too. and Melba
were among those who answered the call.
Social Sydney, recovering from its frenzy,
is now licking the scars. Mayor Mostyn
nearly lost liis job over his participation in
the celebrations. The Electrical Trades’
Union, of which he is assistant-secretary,
considers he “lost his block” and made him-
self part of “the pomp and splendor of the
Mediaeval ages.” Well, the E.T.L. can be-
lieve this Letter when it whispers that never
before did a Lord Mayor allow himself to
be so overlooked. Thus at the State recep-
tion to the visitors, in his own city and his
own town hall, he was content to enter the
hall at the end of the procession with only
the Governor’s young daughter by his side.
Like the dog with the broken tail, he has
his week-end to reflect over. Then there’s
the Sydney that felt it should have been
asked to the Government House private
party and wasn’t; and there’s the Sydney
that, is feeling hurt at being asked to a
garden-narty at the big house to have its
best frock and hat spoiled by weather which
plainly indicated an indoors affair. There’s
feeling, too. among the wives of the Ministers
over precedence on the Oaves trip. The only
people who remain calm are the Macarthur
Onslows, and they are used to Royalty. Even
in the Camden pastures there are Lords and
Marquises.
That good and useful citizen Mrs.
Maybanke Anderson died in Paris on Good
Friday; she was there on a visit with Pro-
fessor Anderson, her husband. Helping Rose
Scott and others to secure the vote for
women (she was Mrs. Wolstenholme in thosr
days) was only part of her achievement;
her own name is mostly associated with the
successful promotion of the kindergarten
movement, and in securing playgrounds for
children and other child-welfare work. The
kindly lady, who was 82 when she died, was
a writer of some note, a contributor to The
Bulletin’s Red Page, and published two
hooks of verse —-one of them “Australian
Songs for Children.” She married Professor
Anderson in 1899.
If you are walking along a South Coast
road and happen to see Cupid at the wheel of
an approaching car, you will know that the
other two travellers are the honeymooning
H. L. .Johnsons. The secretary of the
N.R.M.A. employed one evening last week
in getting married. The new Mrs, Johnson
was Rosalie Croad, from the Macleay River.
The kirk at Waliroonga was decked with
the North Shore line’s prize foliage for the
wedding of Jean Marjorie Johnson and Keith
Nettleton. Morley Johnson, the brides
father, escorted his youngest daughter in her
silver lame and clouds of tulle between
the flowering pews, and two softly green
and autumn-tinted maids attended to the
train and the holding of the bouquet. Gains-
borough, the Warm wee home of the bride s
parents, held the wedding feast.
Sir James, Sir James ! And just when the
dear old S. M. Herald was being so British-
to-the-backbone, too ! Prince Albert when he
sought a wife cut all the old German entangle
meats and turned to a Scottish lass; yet the
final dash of incense in three-quarters ot a
column of Herald adulation of Elizabeth ot
York had to be made in Germany. As its
final hosanna that clarion of Empire pro-
claimed the Duchess as the “Gnadige frail.
After keeping a laborious record extending
over weeks, this Letter has come to the con-
clusion that being a duchess is an unpopular
job. Down to 10.25 this morning 909!)
women had declared, by sea. land and air,
that they wouldn’t change jobs with Lhza-
beth of York for all the tea in China, or,
bringing the idea within the realm of possi-
bility, for a hundred-pound note, u ell. one
penpusher would. Being a duchess wonk
he a boredom worth living through. For one
string of diamonds and a triple rope of pearls
the writer referred to will swap places r«>
morrow—and let whoever likes keep thr
baby. If the pocket-edition Duchess real)?
wants an exchange of jobs, she can >y
accepting this frank offer (office hours,
till 5) do away with the profit-snatching
commission-agent.
Snake skin coats and jumpers are becom-
ing so fashionable in Europe, and America
that maybe in time to come St. Patrick wii
not be considered such a benefactor to li
land for having expelled her serpent*.
Indeed, the saint’s serpent-charming may d<
another injustice to Ireland yet.

While Sydney was under the deluge all
the world smiled in Melbourne, for Easter,
though crisply cold, was sunny and bright.
Folks went holidaying and picnicking, and
the city put on a Sunday aspect from Friday
morning till Tuesday. Society mostly went
to Geelong for the tennis tournament, and
golfers hied them to Barwon Heads for a
similar sort of festival. Which reminds one
of the maiden who asked a chance partner
at the links “What is your handicap?” “Late
nights,” he wearily replied.
Melbourne is dressed up for the Royal
visitors, and the route of the city procession
is kaleidoscopic with flags. A sash of red,
white, and blue bunting has been tied round
the middles of the shops in Swanston-street,
and St. Paul’s Cathedral is about the only
building thereabouts that hasn’t been given
a waist-line. Festoons, pennons and colored
lights are linked from Venetian masts all the
way from St. Kilda to the Exhibition.
Collins-street wears an overhead swathing
of miles of dark green muslin draped in small
festoons, but these already look like coils
of grass-hued rope. A green banner with
the white rose of York thereon is an object
of heraldic and Hibernian interest. A few
business houses are showing their public
spirit by putting out signs of festivity, and
one has taken a chance on the weather with
the greeting “The Sunny South Salutes You.”
Muriel Starr’s first appearance as her
own manager was cordially received on Satur-
day, and the adventuresome actress was
too tearful at the last curtain of “The Gold-
fish” to say anything more than “Thank
you.” A garden of blossoms formed a back-
ground for a green sequined gown that
shimmered with silver dust. The Princess
theatre was crowded with an audience that
gurgled over with laughter. The heroine's
choice in dogs varies with her fortunes, start-
ing with a Skye terrier and a Pekinese, and
winding up with a white wolf-hound, whose
mistress’s wine-velvet ensemble suit is just
the right touch to complete the picture. Miss
Starr first gladdens the eye .in pyjamas of
orange brocade with an emerald green
smoking jacket. Unique is a neflliqe of
white that has cascades of gold feathers,
white-tipped from waist-line to floor. Silver
iind blue is glimpsed beneath. Rertlia Ilallen-
ger in her glistening blue evening frock, a
couple of sizes too large, from beneath which
appear heavy boots and white stockings, is
a delightful memory.
(oats we are likely to see again when the
Royal melee starts made appearance in the
stalls and d.c. The latest mode has a
pouched back, distinguishing it from last
years model. Gold tissue subdued by
oxidisation seems to be accepted as the right
thing to cover the evening scintillation, and
the collar should be of brown fur. sable for
preference. Mrs. W. Bates was one of the
"carers of the new gilding in the front row
m the d.c. Seen in the stalls were Dr. and
Ill's. M. Plealy, just back from 18 months
abroad, Mrs. J. J, Brenan and the
Jowetts. The gallery gave glad greeting
to Lee White and hubby Clay Smith on their
entrance to the r.s.
The V.R.C. meeting at Moonee Valley
ast week was a somewhat bleak affair,
rew of the usual fair patrons graced the
members’ stand and the chill in the breeze
® ade topcoats and furs a necessity. Elmer
Lilly's wife covered a natural-colored kasha
f ut yith a short squirrel coat, topped by
tam-o-shanter millinery of wine hue. Mrs.
brnest Pearce’s rust-colored check velvet
coat was bordered and collared with mole-
.l and allied to a black velvet hat. A
enmson rose brightened Mrs. Ben Chaffey’s
au-bJack turnout, and Dr. E. B. Allan’s
ivite wore millinery of burgundy-colored
wivet with navy-blue covering. A trio of
smartly-covered lassies was made up of Mar-
r°"e "atier, a study in parma-violet tone;
mtour Lomax, coated and hatted in mush-
"mm-pnik: and Kathleen Rogers Thomson,
wnose apparel and millinery were of the
wend described as “dregs of wine.”
ti of the 77 societies affiliated with
> e National Council of Women assembled
f r° ■ one evening last week to greet
wiy homers. Decorations left, over from
i we( h!iiig feast in the afternoon made a
■mow of autumn-tinted maple foliage, and
loses beneath tall palms, and hollyhocks
.red, pmk blooms in the corners of the
lj ec ' e P tlon - ro °m beneath the glow of rosy
-guts. President Glencross welcomed her
Ex. with a posy, and the Governor’s wife,
whose simple gown was of black georgette
and lace, with a pink rose resting on one
shoulder, told the Council that it was the
“nerve centre of all women's activities.” The
decorating of four deserving members with
the Council’s new gold badge was the even-
ing’s chief item; the four were Mrs. D. A.
Skene, who lias held every office at some
period and now is Federal president; Dr.
Edith Barrett, hon. secretary and a strong-
right hand always; Mrs. Edward Bage, who
has guided the treasury for years; and Mrs.
G. G. Henderson, a. past president and
noted philanthropist. Mrs. Henderson
struck an original note in her thanksgiving
when she deplored that women who interested
themselves in public work had to “lead double
lives.” A regular gale of laughter ensued,
and the ambiguous phrase cast a glow of
cheerfulness over the rest of the proceedings.
Heavily-gilded pasteboards were scat-
tered around by the directors of the Rex
for a dinner and dance on the eve of the
regular opening of the new jazz restaurant.
The venture, on which £40,000 has been
spent, occupies the second floor of the
Nicholas Building. Old rose and gold
draperies are contrasted with a white and
gold interior enlivened by a few touches of
red. There are panels in bas relief too,
and the lighting is gorgeous. Amid the
silver rose-bowls of violets on the tables
are rose-red lamps and crystal baskets of
fruit and flowers electrically lit. The dance
floors are of parquetry, and carpets in a
pattern of autumn leaves harmonise with
extremely pretty china, bordered with cot-
tage-garden blooms. The band is up to the
latest standard of saxoplioniness. A
specialty will be made of late supper
parties-—the place doesn’t close its eyes tilt
three in the morning. Among the guests were
General Johnston arid his daughter, she
sparkling in pink. The Mackey lady was
also in pink with scintillations; Elva and
Margot Rosenthal, Miss Bentwitch, tennis
champion Schlesinger and his wife, and
Dr. Gengoult Smith were there. A notable
toilette was of black with a liberal amount
of crystal fringe, a green-sequined dragon
curling its way from corsage to waistline.
The womenfolk of Air Force members have
banded themselves to assist in providing-
comforts for the After Care Home run by
the district nurses. Group-Captain Wil-
liams’s wife convened the meeting that
launched the new organisation. Mrs, G. G.
Henderson, president of the District Nurses,
explained the work and object of the After-
Care Home, which is an institution for
convalescents. Office-bearers and executive
of the Air Auxiliary will be elected at a
gathering at Mrs. James Black's home on
the 29th.
Close to Royalty during the next few
days will be this good-looking young matron,
who is the wife of General Harry Cliauvel.
As Sybil Jopp,
o f Banana-
land's capital,
.s h e married
her soldier hus-
band at an age
when m o s t
girls are still
in the school-
room. Though
always in the
inner circle of
» o v e r n mem;
House, she is
the simplest of
frockers. Out-
side her home
and her family
her principal
interests ar e
centred in the
F r iendly
Union of Sol-
diers’ Wives
and Mothers
over which she presides, the Girl Guides and
several charity organisations. Lafayette’s
camera caught this glimpse of the lady.
The Norman Bayles matron let two new
debs, loose in the social arena on Saturday
evening when she opened her Toorak door
to guests and dispensed music and bubbly.
It was her first trick in the social game since
returning from a long absence abroad. Both
Ayliffe, her daughter, and Maroa Moles-
worthy, her niece, had been presented at
Court, so neither was fussed at a second
course.
Dr. Georgina Sweet and Melbourne’s first
woman barrister, Flos Greig, came home last
week after seeing foreign parts. The doctor
has been in the Orient for two years, and
for the last 12 months has had the com-
pany of her legal friend. Relations and
friends spread food and drink before the
tired travellers at the Lyceum Club.
Several of Melbourne’s domestic-science
teachers put on the kettle at Menzies’ last
week to make a farewell cup of tea for Mrs.
H. O. Storer. who was for many years
Director of Needlecraft. A few months
ago she downed thimble and said “Enough."
Her trunks are packed for a long holiday
on the other side of the world. A travelling
case and lots of flowers were remembrances
from colleagues.
Last week the Repertory Theatre Society
held its first meeting under the new manage-
ment, and decks were cleared for further
action. Robert Garran, George Syme, Pro-
fessor Osborne and F. Grassick were
appointed trustees and Mrs. Fred Rae, Isabel
Handley and Mrs. M. M. Phillips, with
some masculine support, were elected to
the house committee. Prof. Ernest Scott
talked about “What constitutes a good
Repertory play,” and gave a bright diag-
nosis.
This is Mrs.
Inez Hutchi-
son, who in
a year has
d emon stimted
that she can
ma k e lamp-
shades th a t
beat the im-
ported article
in every re-
spect. She
attributes h e r
success to
training re-
ceived from her
mother, wh o
li a d a talent
for the decora-
tive crafts and
encouraged her
school- girl
daughter to
follow her
example. Mrs.
Hutchison took to lamp-shade making when
the serious of her husband made it
necessary for her to do something to keep
the pot boiling. Having been a Gallery
student for a time, she knew something
about drawing and color. Then she dis-
covered how to manufacture parchment and
dye it. The public appreciated her dainty
wares from the start, and they became so
well known that she was commissioned to
supply the lampshades for Government
House at Canberra. The clever craftswoman,
who is pictured by Lafayette, has recently
designed an inverted shade. The light that
filters through the white flowered parchment
is much more pleasing than that diffused
through frosted glass or thin marble.
When Alvie Stevenson, elder daughter of
the Alex. Stevenson couple of East Denili •
quin, married Captain Drake of the Indian
Army at Scots’ Church, her gown of silver
had a topping of gold lace, and a Russian
head-piece of brilliants and gold beads
fastened her white tulle veil. Rhonda
Clarke came from Tasmania to help Lola
King of Upper Beaconsfield with the
bridesmaiding. The pair fitted nicely into
the picture in frocks of amber and lemon
georgette with a splash of silver. Bandeaux
of the combined lines, dangling gold tassels,
circled their coiffures. The bride’s parents
received at No. 9.
Helen Margaret, second daughter of the J.
Burt Stewarts. Rusliworth, has engaged her-
self to George Garnet Fielding, son of the
late William and Mrs. Fielding, Toorak.
An Aussie endeavoring to write her name
on the scroll of sport is Susie Tolhurst, who
is in Europe companioned by her mother and
a sister. She swings a clever driver on the
links, and has entered for several champion-
ships in England.
Dermot Casey, returning this week, has
found a ready-made home at South Yarra.
The William Cains, being anxious to spend
some months on their rural acreage, were
glad of a tenant. The Caseys haven’t been
in Australia since their marriage. Dermot
has been on the Australian Commissioner’s
staff in New York, where his wife, who was
Gwynneth Browne, a grand-daughter of
“ Rolf Boldrewood, ” became a popular
hostess.
Trippers in search of sunshine look
askance at our wintry grey aspect. But
some visitors find a charm in it. Amongst
them is Mrs. Helen Cunliffe, who is making
a yearly habit of seeing Melbourne. This
is her third visit, and she is still full of
enthusiasm. During the war years her home
at Ambleside became a sanctuary for weary
Diggers, and many of those friendships are
still healthy. Mrs. Cunliffe left the liner at
Perth to visit friends, but is now settled
at the Oriental.
Violinist Edouard Lambert, who, with his
pianist son, Raymond, came front Belgium
a year or so ago, has now been joined by his
wife, one of the songsters of the Brussels
Opera House, and the remainder of his
family. Madame’s first concert appearance
was at a recital given by father, mother and
son at Ormond Hall in aid of the Blind
Women’s Hostel. The plump, dark-eyed
singer, who has a big soprano voice, gave an
aria from “La Boheme” and the Arditi
Waltz Song, and showed no lack of dramatic
fire. The newcomer was gowned in nale
pink with a glistening overlay, and took
her posies with an air. Hubby and son did
the accompaniment well, and the trio won't
lack for future appeals to ascend the concert
platform.
THE LITTLE SISTERS.
TASMANIA.
Hobart.
On Saturday weeks of patriotic prepara-
tion culminated in one great and glorious
moment as the Renown glided up the Der-
went and the Royal salute from the Sydney's
guns woke echoes from every hill around rue
city. Weather was warm and sunny, and
the crowds on the wharves were diversified
with dashes of color that covered thankful
feminine hearts. The silver-grey battle-
cruiser broke out into flags from stem to
stern at the salute, matching the streets
of the city. Hobart expressed its loyalty
in so much bunting that one instinctively
peered upward at Mount Wellington, looming
through the last wreaths of the vanishing
morning mists, exnecting to find it too cloaked
in a Union jack.
Elizabeth of York was in high spirits, and
Hobart’s first glimpse found her flashing her
merry smile. She waved her hand to the
waiting throngs, and evidently found Hobart
very much to her liking. The drive to the
Town Hall, where Mayor Rogers was wait-
ing in full regalia with an address of welcome,
was a triumphal procession—a mile of cheers
and smiles. At Government House the
O’Grady and his niece received the Royal
tourists, with a background of our very best
people. Boy Scouts and Girl Guides were
out in force, and there was a bevy of
Brownies who danced past instead of march-
ing and made the Duchess laugh heartily.
Then, in the afternoon, a big public recep-
tion in old Franklyn-square, bordered by
venerable trees in brown-gold autumn
dress. About 12,000 citizens filed past.
Royalty couldn t acknowledge every saluta-
tion. but the pair split the task, the Duchess
smiling her sweetest at the children,
while the Duke made a specialty of ac-
knowledging the curtseys of very old ladies.
At. night the Ministry gave a ball at the
City Hall, where there was such dressing
as Hobart has never seen before.
The devout who attended nine-o’clock com-
munion at St. David's on Sunday were
rewarded by an unexpected glimpse of the
Yorks at close quarters, and the pair were
there again at the 11 o'clock service.
The Royal party spent Sunday night at
Mona Yale House, Ross, as guests of Eustace
and Mrs. Cameron. It is the second time
it has sheltered royalty; the Duke of Edin-
burgh stayed there when the late R. I. Ker-
mode was host.
When you come to Hobart mind yon don’t
jay-walk. The catch on a recent day was
”7 and the price was 14s. <>d. Unless people
settle down to right-angled methods, this
source of revenue bids fair to compete with
Tatt.’s.
Kathleen Pearce was the guest-of-honor
at many parties previous to the golden-liaired
little lady becoming the bride of Robert Hay.
son of the Bishop of Tasmania.
Eileen Chancellor will have her home in
Norfolk Island after her marriage next
month to Captain Stopp, ex-aide of Governor
O'Grady. The marriage will rob Hobart of
one of its most charming and enthusiastic
Girl Guide leaders.
Members of the Victoria League, at tin 1
invitation of the deputy-president, filled the
Lyceum Club rooms to overflowing to fare-
well Mrs. Lloyd Ohlmeadow, who is to tell
England of Victoria League doings in the
Speck.
We’ve read of Sydney shops advertising
“Duchess pink,” but one of Hobart’s enter-
prising rag vendors has struck a more inti-
mate note. He is making a brave show of
“Betty blue.”
His Excellency the O’Grady, at the meet-
ing to consider the revival of the Hobart
branch of the Overseas Club, preached power-
fully against insularity. “If I thought,” he
said, “that the league was going to be a
merely parochial thing, I should have nothing
to do with it.” Those present quite agreed
with him. Indeed, they couldn’t see how
an institution of such a nature as the Over-
seas Club could be anything but far-reaching
in its aims. So it was resolved to revive it,
with Sir James, the foe of the Parish Pump,
as its patron.
Social events marked time last week, but
there were bridge and mali-jongg parties by
way of farewells to Mrs. Fern Smith, who,
with her pretty young daughter, is off to
England on the 26th.
The new Art Gallery is becoming better
known, and this week's exhibition of bush
scenes in water-color by the South Austra-
lian artist Arnold James is helping it along.
Blamire Young and John Eldersliaw are
represented on the walls as well, and it is
announced that an exhibition of woodcuts is
under way.
There was a big attendance of members
of the Royal Ilobart Golf Club at Rosuy
last week, when an exciting teams match,
ladies r. men, was played, one team consist-
ing of 10 a side, the other of 11. The
sex that uses lip-sticks proved that it could

shaving—Soaps, Brushes, and
mugs are things of the past.
Now Shavex —obtain-
able everywhere —is the
choice of men who appre-
ciate speed, ease and com-
fort in shaving. They
just squeeze a little from
the tube and lightly smear
it on the wetted beard,
without rubbing, for
Shavex is so com-
pounded that its fine con-
stituents soften the hairs
immediately on contact.
One swift, smooth sweep of the razor leaves the skin clean and silky—
ust visualise the advantages—a squeeze from the tube, smearing, and
ready to shave ! Go to your chemist, hairdresser, or store to-day, and

The hunting season in the Midlands is
in full swing again, the first meet taking-
place at the Mackinuon home, Dalness. A
big field turned out. the drag being taken
by a recent bride, Mrs. James Melrose, on
hello and Mr. A. D. Mackinnon on Norval.
There was a dearth of official hostesses
for the Royal visit. The combined strength
of the Ministry can produce only one wife
for the pur-
1 loses of this
(1 i s c u ssion.
Mrs. Lyons
suffered s o
much through
the strain of
the Premier’s
terrible acci-
dent and long
recovery, and
the anxiety
occasioned *b y
her separation
f r o m li e r
young family,
that she has
been obliged to
give up all
public activi-
ties for the
present. Mrs.
A. G. Ogilvie,
wife of th e
Attorney-Gen-
eral, took Mrs. Lyons's place at the various
functions. The wives of the other Ministers,
Mr. Guy and Mr. Belton, are never seen or
heard of in the capital. Sixty-four young
Tasmanian blossoms had visions of making
their curtsey to the little Duchess on Satur-
day night, but as our best mathematicians
calculated that the time required to make a
curtsey with proper dignity is two minutes,
some other means of precipitating these
young persons into society had to be found.
So they just marched past T.R.H.’s, and
Mrs. Ogilvy, whose portrait goes herewith,
said who was who.
QUEENSLAND.
Brisbane.
Brisbane still lives with its memories of
the Ducal visitation. For the State reception
at Parliament House the Duchess wore ivory
with crystal embroideries fringed with long-
trained ends of delphinium blue and a dia-
mond tiara, and she carried a rose feather fan.
The Countess of Cavan was in wine color.
The acting-Premier and Mrs. Forgan Smith
received. There were some very handsome
gowns worn. Many of the Ministers’ wives
were in black.
The Mayor’s garden party was held under
cloudless, moonlit skies in New Farm Park.
A Venetian carnival on the water lit up
the river to best advantage, and jewelled
fights were strung round about the space
reserved for the Royal party and the Mayor’s
guests. Chinese lanterns of soft glowing
yellows swayed in the little wind, and all
Brisbane seemed to have gathered outside the
select enclosure to admire the fireworks, the
frocking and the golden outlines of the un-
usual river craft. Combined choirs under
George Sampson sang, and the advent of
several green frogs from the moist low-lying
sedges caused a good deal of excitement
amongst the white-frocked maidens. Otherwise
arrangements were wonderfully smooth. No
hitches and no accidents occurred, though
many thousands must have been surging
against the barrier. The Duchess wore a
pink souple coat, with a rose-toned posy of
flowers, a shell-pink mariette frock, a boa
of rose-pink feathers, a diamond tiara and
ropes of pearls. The Countess of Cavan was
in black velvet and coat of gold and turquoise.
Mrs. Jolly wore pink: and Mrs. Lennon, over
her black lace, had a velvet coat bordered in
skunk. Mrs. J. L. Woolcock was in jade.
There w r ere many yacht parties on the river,
while for those who wanted only one-and-six-
pence worth the Doomba lay in the river
reaches, before the gaily-lit park.
Both the Yorks seemed much refreshed by
their visit to Tamrookum, where they went
a-riding, and also saw some good cattle draft-
ing, and, at the Beaudesert Show, had a guard
of honor of wide-hatted, blue-shirted bush-
men. The rooms at Tamrookum were filled
with flowers, but there was only a small
house-party, relatives of the family alone
being invited besides those in the Royal
train.
When the Duke was invested with the
honorary degree of Doctor of Laws in the
Exhibition Building the gathering included
members of the Uni. Senate, the undergrads,
in cap and gown, meeting the Duke at the
gates. George Sampson played Elgar’s march
"Pomp and Circumstance.” During the
morning the Royal visitors had a little private
trip to One Tree Hill to see the view, and
after lunch the Duchess received Brisbane’s
women journalists at Government House.
Then, along a route lined with human
beings out for a last look at her, the Duchess
went to Parliament House, where the Country
Women’s Association and the Creche and
Kindergarten met her, Colonel Cameron and
Mrs. Fairfax receiving her at the entrance.
There were more addresses and a teddy-bear
for the baby princess. Hydrangea-pink was
worn by the Duchess. She had a pink silk
straw hat and she w r ore her pearls. The
Countess of Cavan was in brown crepe de
Chine and Mrs. Gilmour wore blue. All the
soldiers’ hostels were also visited, the Duke
and Duchess spending a long time talking
to the invalid men ; and then the Cross of
Remembrance at Toowong was visited by
Prince Albert, who laid a wreath upon the
stone.
After Mrs. Forrest’s poetical Welcome to
Queensland had been read at the Exhibition
Hall, of course the Little Duchess wanted
to shake hands with the writer: and then
there was quite a long talk, and inquiries
about the lady's work. And after that the
Duchess wanted copies of all the Forrest
hooks, and now “Streets and Gardens,” “The
Green Harper,” “The Wild Moth” and “Gam-
ing Gods” are in the Royal luggage. If she
had waited a week or two longer she could
have had “Hibiscus Heart,” too —copies have
just reached Australia.
Fred Derrick, who is to marry Irene
Brown on the 26th, was given a send-off hy
his pals of the Yeronga tennis club. He has
risen to president during his 12 years of
belonging. A silver coffee percolator was
handed up. Pretty Irene Brown has had
some dozen parties given for her share.
May Macfarlane, pictured here by Trissie
Deazeley, is a valiant worker for good causes.
She was struck by the lonely, friendless
position of so many' women when their men-
folk enlisted, and founded the Mutual Service
Club, serving as hon. sec. throughout the
war, and seeing that it lived up to its name
amo n g the
relatives o f
men a t £li e
Front. The war
over, she foun-
ded the Queens-
land Country
Women’s Asso-
ciation. Most
of her public
work in Bris-
bane has been
done under
tiie auspices of
the Women’s
Club, to which
she lias given
valuable ser-
vice in munici-
p a 1 affairs.
Mrs. M acf ar-
ia n e also
started the
Dickens Fe 1-
lowship. Two
long trips to out-of-the-way parts of the
Mandated Territory and the Solomon Islands
produced much in the way of journalistic
results, and so whetted the appetite for more
that another jaunt to fresh isles is on her
programme for the near future. She has
been a member of the National Council of
Women for years, and has held office. She
serves the Country Women’s Association as
delegate to the New Settlers’ League and
keeps country branches posted concerning
new arrivals in their districts, so that friend-
ship may be shown the newcomers.
WESTHALIA.
Perth.
Mrs Fred Hammond and Lillah Malloeh
were among hostesses to pour tea in honour
of pretty Pat Walsh, who had promised to
walk down the aisle with Fred Curran on
the 20th. It’s a morning affair, so Pat has
forsaken the usual frothy tulle for a long-
sleeved model of white silk crepe and a white
felt hat.
The vice-regal Campions went along to
applaud the Repertory Club’s production of
Somerset Maugham’s “Circle.” Edith Beck,
in beautifully-cut frocks, made a vivaciouc
Kitty, and Dorothy Mark an intriguing
Elizabeth —her job was to elope, and she did
it very nicely in the last act.
Another great event in the village by the
Swan has been the opening of a dental hos-
pital. The official ceremony took place in
the spacious Y.A.L. Hall, where all the lead-
ing lights made speeches. Tea was served in
the flower-decked ballroom.
Brought back from a holiday jaunt in
India by the Maloja is Mrs. Colin Craig.
She took her two little hopefuls to visit their
grandparents, General “Birdy” and his lady,
in Delhi.
The Repertory Club will miss clever Nell
Anketell, who is to accompany Olga Ainslie
to the Cold Country at the end of the month.
About the same date pretty Daphne and
Betty de Bernales will lock up their Cottesloe
mansion to take their exquisitely-dressed papa
for some more travelling abroad.
Dr. Lindsay G. Male, son of the S. W.
Males, of „East Camberwell (Vic.), had a
recent wedding date at boronia-scented
Albany. His bride is Nora Wliitelock,
youngest daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Fred
Wliitelock. The bridegroom, now superin-
tendent' of the Children’s Hospital, Perth,
is a graduate of Melbourne Uni., who after-
wards went to London and then to Vienna,
doing post-graduate work at various hos-
pitals. The new home will be in Perth.
This smiling young lady is Linley Wilson,
who spent four years in London studying
dancing with Espinosa, mditre de ballet of
Daly’s and the
Gaiety, an d
with Madame
Olivette. She
became one of
O 1 i v e t t e’s
assistants, and
was i among
the' students
chosen to
dance in “Hia-
watha,” pro-
duced at
Daly’s. Miss
Wilson is a
member of the
Folk Dance
Society, an d
has made a
specialty o f
the old-time
dances revived
by the erudite
Cecil Sharp.
She now has a studio of her own in Perth,
and plans to visit England in September for
further study, and she hopes to have a look
at America in two years’ time. Her father
was the late Frank Wilson, one-time Premier
of this State.
The making of woollen coat-posies
threatens to become a craze as infectious
as jumper-knitting was a few months ago.
The fashioning of these blossoms becomes so
fascinating that the housewife finds herself
forgetting more important duties, and at
least one husband has had to complain of
finding wool in the soup-—but husbands
must have a grouch of some sort or they
aren't happy. Anyway, the trifles are tilings
of beauty and do wonders in the way of
cheering up a dull-colored winter costume.

Two More
Australian Records
1,4-79% miles in 24 hours,
including all stoppages, is the
remarkable record created on
the Maroubra Speedway by Mr.
Boyd Edkins, who drove a 14/40
Vauxhall car using Shell Spirit.
Messrs. Guy Barrenger and
Walter Whitbourn, driving a
Paige brougham fuelled with
Shell, established a record non-
stop run from Sydney to Mel-
bourne and back. This distance
of 1,100 miles was covered
in 43 hours with the gear box
sealed in “Top.”
For endurance, power, speed
or all-round excellence, Shell is
unique. Its unvarying quality
and absolute reliability are sub-
stantiated in practice by a
continuous sequence of record
performances.

“Alwyn”: W. C. Wentworth was not only
the first Australian-born poet—he wrote a
poem on Australasia at Cambridge in 1823
—but the pioneer leader-writer. Ilis first
editorial may be found in the initial number
of the Australian, issued on October 14,
1824.
"H.K.”: Speaking of Australian writers
who have been translated into foreign tongues
(B. 7/4/’27), Marcus Clarke’s “For the
Term of His Natural Life” was published
in Germany two or three years after its
original appearance.
“Bill R.” : The first free paper was pub-
lished in Australia much more than 30 years
ago (B. 24/3/’27), and it was not a Sydney
suburban sheet. In 1882 the Free Press,
a four-page weekly sheet, was distributed
gratis in the streets and homes of Bega
(N.S.W.). It lived on its ads. for a few
years, too.
“Topee”: Was chatting with my book-
seller when an elderly couple (evidently
from the country) entered and asked for a
copy of the “Cameera of Bokerslniy.” Mr.
Wegg pondered a moment, then expressed
his regret at having just sold his last copy
of Boccaccio’s “Decameron” and suggested a
cheap edition of De Maupassant as a pleas-
nntly exhilarating substitute. The pair,
snorting jointly, left the shop without mak-
ing a purchase.
“L.E.”: I am intrigued with the word
"Cooboo,” which I encountered for the first,
time in Katharine Prichard’s recent
Bulletin story, “The Cooboo,” a little
masterpiece that few writers in the world
could match. “Cooboo” is the native name
for a baby, and should replace the American
“piccaninny.” The time has gone when
stupid people regarded aboriginal names as
uncouth and comic; writers, who should have
good ears, are beginning to realise now how
expressive they are. “Cooboo,” which comes
from the North-West, has an appealing sound
about it, and is suggestive of the strange spirit
of the country. Katharine Prichard deserves
the thanks of all good Australians for intro-
ducing this native word- to the English
language.
“F.J.L.”: Edward Ellis was hardly the
first editor of the Sydney Sunday TimEvS
(B. 31/3/’27). That paper and the Globe
were first printed by Bailey in Galbraith’s-
lane, King-street, about ’BS. Edward Ellis,
in conjunction with Herbert and Walter
Ridsdale, bought the Sunday Times and
shifted to Clarence-street, where I, then a
boy of 19, had charge of the publishing-
room until we printed the first Referee,
I think in November, 1887. In those days
it was no unusual thing for us to scout
around to the suburban newsagents on Fri-
day to raise enough cash for the comps.’
wages. Ellis and Ridsdale afterwards formed
a company; later, M. R. Evans acquired the
sole ownership and shifted us around to
York-street. Larry Foley’s “monthly” fights
occurred every Saturday night at the old
White Horse and often on Wednesday, too ;
I know, as I reported many of them before
Bill Corbett’s time.
“Venturiuo”: The late Lord Northcliffe's
observations on Australian slang have an
interest all their own. In his book pub-
lished after his world tour, after explaining
“bonza” and “dinkum,” he wrote: “To
express discomfort or disgust, two words are
used—‘Fare-cow.’ I cannot get hold of the
derivation. The Australian soldiers wrote
home about the life in the wet trenches of
France being ‘fare-cow.’ The French use
the word cow (vache) as a term of con-
tempt.” How few Australian yarns must
the titled journalist have read to use the
spelling he does, and to imagine that the
term was a war coinage. Which reminds me
that the other day one of my boys in a
super-primary class wrote down our Aus-
tralian expression of hearty assent as “to
write.” Northcliffe would probably have
explained the term as showing the speaker
to be in such thorough agreement with some
sentiment that he was willing “to write” it
down, to publish it abroad —an equivalent
of the Yankee “I’ll tell the woild.”
"Gregor”: The Federal Government is
■straining at a gnat and swallowing a camel
when it debars the importation of such rela-
tively innocuous publications as La Vie
I’arihiejVne and Fliegende Blatter, to
mention only a couple, and gives free en-
trance to most of the criminally-provocative
organs of Communism. Several of the latter
can be purchased without difficulty in
Sydney or Melbourne, and their pages reek
with poisonous propaganda. The Common-
wealth, incidentally, is practically the only
country which prohibits the French journal,
an d it is one of the very few which take
no hostile notice of Communist prints.
THE HAPPY MAN.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I met young Smith the other day
In merry pin.
“Now why,” I asked, “so blithe and gay?
You’ve had a win
In Tatt.’s, you lucky rascal, eh?
Or where the clamorous bookies lay
The field? Or is the reason, say,
Just feminine?”
“Don’t,” he adjured me, “be a jay!
They’ve put it in.”
“And what is it? And who are they?”
I still persisted. “Tell me, pray.”
He gave a grin.

“Bill Bowyang”: High up on the press
censors’ stall' at G.H.Q., Cairo, during the
war was one Major McPherson, a London
Times man, who carefully scanned every
line of The Bulletin when the Australian
mail arrived. In a paragraph forwarded to
Tiie Bulletin after the battle of Bafa I
mentioned that our guns on the left were
responsible for many casualties amongst the
Turks. When the paper arrived I was taken
from Sheik Nuran, in Palestine, under armed
escort to Cairo and charged with having
supplied information likely to be of value
to the enemy. It took me half an hour to
convince the Court —all press censors in Im-
perial service—that over three months had
passed since I had penned those lines, and
that the Turk knew perfectly well while
the battle was proceeding at Rafa what
damage our guns were doing.

To hear the “Wurlitzer” is to at once recognise the glorious quality of its tone —a tone of rich mellow
beauty in the bass, bell-like clarity in the middle and upper registers—and marked throughout with the
true singing quality.
To play the “Wurlitzer” is a delightful experience to all true music lovers—for its construction is so
perfect that practically no effort is required to operate it, whilst the expression controls are so ingeni-
ous and simple that the veriest beginner can reproduce faithfully any class of music. Do not fail to
inspect the Wurlitzer,’ on view at most high-class music stores.

Spain supplies the setting for “Frasquita,”
which reintroduced Marie Burke to Sydney
at Her Majesty’s on Saturday, and peasants
and gipsies the human background. Natu-
rally the music, by Franz Lehar, has been
designed to match the surroundings. It is
good, and occasionally very good, and the
comedy has some really bright oases in a
desert of re-hash. Marie Burke portrays
Frasquita, a gipsy beauty treated as a kind
of princess by her people. Unlike her sub-
jects. she is too proud to steal, but she has
enough temperament to satisfy’ three leading
ladies and a prima donna, with some left
over for a star soubrette, and this excess
is responsible for a love-hate affair with
Herbert Browne, a young Frenchman,
Armand Mirbeau. Arinand calls her a thief
and hands her over to the law for an offence
perpetrated by one of her larcenous tribe.
To avenge the insult she sets out to capture
his affections so that she may have the plea-
sure of jilting him, but falls in love with
him herself. Two acts are occupied with
this temperamental seesaw, with a Mephis-
tophelean gipsy eternally at Frasquita’s
elbow to keep her up to the vengeance mark.
Finally, having risen to be an affluent prima
donna, Frasquita induces Armand to break
off his engagement with his cousin and then
turns him down,' to her own immediate heart-
break. The third act transforms the dis-
ordered state of affairs from the tragedy that
would be required for grand opera to the
happiness necessary for musical comedy,
with the gipsy Mephistopheles, resigned to
bis own loss for his beloved’s benefit, bestow-
ing a blessing of sorts on Frasquita and
Armand as they cling limpet-like to one
another.
* «■ * »
There was altogether too much of it on
Saturday, but the specialty dances of Tliurza
Rogers and Robert Lascelles and, in a lesser
degree, of Sylvia Miller and Alexis Dolinoff
are not amongst the items that could be
spared. It is a tribute to Marie Burke’s
histrionic ability, though she was less suc-
cessful than in “Wildflower,” that she makes
the swift-changing moods of the tempera-
mental person seem reasonable, but Herbert
Browne is a stoic peg on which to hang the
ribbons of her passion. Browne’s singing
is good, but even that is handicapped by his
stiff artificiality. The reliable Gaston Mer-
vale presents the faithful gipsy lover, Sebas-
tiano; the humor of the piece is supplied by
Cecil Kellaway, who, as General Aristide
Girot, walks easily through the part, giving
some good touches to a tipsy scene, marred
by an occasional tendency to forget that he is
tipsy, and R. Barrett-Lennard, who makes
the most of Hippolyt Gallipot. Frank Haw-
thorne is an amusing valet; and Thelma
Burness, who was pleasing but colorless as
Dolly, and Marie Eaton as Luisa are the
others who matter most.
* * *
Frank Neil has evidently decided that his
audiences like their comedy broad, and there
are no efforts to maintain in “Charley’s
Aunt,” which was revived at the Grand
Opera House on Saturday, any of the lighter
touches associated with former productions
of the good old farce. Frank represents the
young man who obliges a pal by imperson-
ating his rich aunt from Brazil; in their
unrestrained enjoyment of his romping his
audience is oblivious of the amazing dunder-
lieadeduess of the stage people who for a
moment accept him in his feminine character.
Allowing for the continual loud pedal the
production is successful, especially in those
thrilling moments when Neil has trouble with
his corsets or stockings. Fred. Macdonald’s
portrayal of Colonel Sir. Francis Chesney
supplies some of the best work in the per-
formance, and Field Fisher is good as Bas-
sett, but Jefferson Taite makes Stephen
Spettigue resemble a successful pork butcher
rather than a country solicitor. Both Gertie
Cremer and Mary Gannon fit thoroughly as
the girls who captivate Jack Chesney (Leslie
Woods) and Charley Wykeham (Paul Lon-
guet) ; Miss Betterton Glover is the genuine
aunt from Brazil, and Lily Molloy makes
an amusing Ella Delahay.
“Sweet Nell’s” successful occupancy of
the Criterion comes to an end on Friday;
on Saturday “The Cradle Snatchers” takes
possession—three middle-aged women hire
three young men to pose as their cavaliers
in order to bring their own flapper-pursuing
husbands to a proper sense of their folly.
Next week there is another new arrival:
“The Cousin from Nowhere" is to vacate
the Royal so that, on the Saturday. “Tip
Toes” can trip in. “Sunny” is piling up
records at the Empire Theatre, without ex-
hausting its popularity, and “Six-Cylinder
Love” at the Palace shows no signs of engine
trouble. Wirth’s Circus has been giving daily
matinees during the Easter holidays. Also
for the benefit of those youngsters who have
no elder relations to take them to a circus,
the Wirths gave, as is their kindly wont, a
free show and bun scramble on Good Friday.

The pictures, which love such things, have
never before staged anything in the way of
spectacles as gorgeous as some of those that
are massed in the film views of the Eucharist
Congress which was held in Chicago last
year; shown at the Sydney Town Hall this
week they are a foretaste of what Sydney
itself will witness when it has a Eucharist
Congress of its own next year, to coincide
with the consecration of the completed St.
Mary’s Cathedral. An absorbing spectacle
is that of hundreds of thousands of worship-
pers attending Mass in an open-air stadium
of huge proportions, with impressively-robed
prelates officiating at a high altar in the
centre. The picture is served with an attrac-
tive concert programme, and, to show that
its screening is no event of religious sol-
emnity, a comedy film helps out the enter-
tainment.
That courageous worker in things musical,
Nathalie Rosenwax, has organised a seven-
nights’ production of “The Geisha” at the
►Sydney Conservatorium, with her friend
Rene Maxwell, who returned not so long
ago from English concert successes, as 0
Mimosa San. Sixty voices have been caught
and trained for the production. Another
coming Conservatorium event is Arthur
Greenaway’s production of “A Midsummer
Night’s Dream,” which the Shakspeare
Society has prompted and is backing. That
event occurs on May 5 and 6.
The return of Sadie Gale, after adventures
in musical comedy, was acclaimed at Fullers’
Theatre (Sydney) on Saturday night by an
audience ever mindful of its favorites. A new
name on the programme was Little June
Megan, an infant phenomenon who is much
above the average of the, snecies, though, like
other clever children, she runs a risk of being
spoiled by early presentation. Stiffy and
Mo continue to fill most of the programme,
and to make their audiences laugh at the
least provocation—or none at all.
Belmont’s Canary Opera, at Sydney
Tivoli, is a vaudeville circumstance
which impresses more on a second
hearing than on the first, when the
birds were, no doubt, like other vocalists,
suffering from the effects of the sea-voyage.
There are 27 of the feathered songsters—

SYDNEY ROYAL.
Uncle Joseph Edam (Arthur Stigant) and
Adrian van Piffel (Gus Bluett).
the canary equivalent of tenors, bassos,
sopranos and contraltos—and their perform-
ance is as amazing as it is pleasing. There
is some side-comedy in the way in which,
whilst the other part-singers carry on, Signor
Yello Caroli preens his breast-feathers like
a complacent tenor settling his waistcoat.
The Kwong Sing Walt troupe is back with
magic in gorgeous Celestial surroundings;
and Mantell’s Mannikins continue to provide
their amusing show.
Too long, alack, the days have been since
we have seen upon the screen the vampire
with the slinky lure that willingly we all
endure; but now with clinging lips and wiles
‘‘The Temptress” once again beguiles. She
ruins bankers by the score—but that is what
a vamp is for. The hero, who’s a fellow
fine, she follows to the Argentine; and in
that rough-and-ready camp she comes once
more the bloke to vamp. But with his job his
thoughts are filled, you see he has a dam to
build ; so on the Argentinos rough she does
her luring vampire stuff. The men with
stockwhips fiercely fight, with slashes left
and slashes _ right, and both become a sorry
sight; it gives .the vampire much delight.
“GUM-TREE GULLY,” AT MELBOURNE
PALACE.
S. M. Fitzgerald, who creates a new Austra-
lian stage Dad, without the traditional
whiskers. Cora Warner, whose Mum
speaks the King’s English.
Then on a dark and stormy night the dam’s
blown up by dynamite; but through the hero’s
woes and stress the vampire wears her low-
necked dress. In vain her slinky clutch she
tries, the hero stern her kiss denies, but six
years later in the strife capitulates and
calls her wife. The moral isn’t very clear,
except that every man should fear the woman
with a pretty face that always sticks about
the place.

The spectacle at Melbourne Princess just
at present is Muriel Starr in a comic role
and a variety of expensive dresses. Begin-
ning married life as the wife of an indi-
gent songwriter, she graduates, at the insti-
gation of a teacher of deportment, via the
Divorce Court from a plain, one-piece cos-
tume and Jim Wetherby’s distasteful flat
on West 24th-street to a costly neglige and
Herman Krauss’s uncultured but ornate
apartment on Riverside-drive. But Her-
man has a chairman of directors who casts
his eye on Muriel, and a second trip to the
Divorce Court translates her to an opera-
cloak of ostrich-plumes and Hamilton J.
Power’s more expensive dwelling on Park-
avenue. _ The third act finds her a widow,
negotiating for a further move to the castle
of the Duke of Middlesex in England. But
tragedy and Muriel have never been far
apart—upon the stage, at any rate. Just as
success and clothes beyond the dreams even
of a programme-seller are in her grasp, her
first husband reappears and reproaches her
with memories of her early love. The insidi-
ous demands of a warm human heart which
has all along been beating beneath the
dazzling clothes are not to be denied, and
she returns to her original long-suffering
mate, though not without the means to main-
tain a wardrobe of a satisfying degree of
splendor.
* * * *
“The Goldfish,” which is the title of the
work, is a Parisian boulevard comedy, which
has found its way to Australia via an Ameri-
can translator of a cautious, not to say Puri-
tanical, disposition. The frank cynicism of
the plot indicates its Gallic origin, but the
sentiment of much of the dialogue suggests
that “Abie’s Irish Rose” may have wet-
nursed it. As Jennie Wetherby Miss Starr
reveals unexpected capacity for light and
effervescing comedy; though that strange
voice of hers, which resembles a deep-toned
bell ringing in an empty house, is ever
ready at the call of pathos. Desmond
McMinn, as her first husband, is an extra-
ordinarily tall young man, whose facial
equipment is adequate for the part of an
interesting hero. Charles Lawrence is
Muriel’s suitably comic and vulgar second
choice, and Carl Lawson pays the bills and
leaves her his fortune as the third. As a
titled Polish teacher of deportment, Harvey
Adams, a capable actor, is the sartorial Sven-
gali, who, instead of bringing out the lady's
voice, develops her taste for gaudy living.
Many changes are threatening in Mel-
bourne. “Tea for Three,” at the Royal, and
“The Fake,” at the King’s, will hardly keep
their respective theatres warm for another
fortnight, and “The Ghost Train,” at the
Athenaeum, at last shows signs of slowing
down. At the Palace, “Gum-tree Gully,” In-
Kate Howarde, will give place on Saturday
to “Possum Paddock,” by the same play-
wright. Two plays in succession by an Aus-
tralian author must be in the nature of a
record. “Rose Marie,” at His Majesty's,
has become an institution, and its advertise-
ments have shrunk to the same dimensions
as the Zoo’s. Alexander Watson, the English
elocutionist, arrives at the Playhouse shortly
to recite his fifth and final swan song to
Australia, though Australia has heard of
final swan songs before.
Good Friday’s hy~-■ of praise in Mel-
bourne began in the afternoon at the Audi-
torium, where Walter Kirby sang, with his
usual art and aplomb, a round half-score of
sacred items, and Dorothy Humphreys, Mar-
garet Kerr and many others joined in the
celestial harmony; it ended at the Exhibition,
where the Philharmonic (society gave its
umpteenth rendering of “Elijah.” ' The archi-
tecture of this building suggests a cave dwell
ing erected by a pious hermit. The waves
of oratorio surged up and down the four
arms of the cruciform Auditorium like
reverberations in a culvert, and although
there were people who could hear the pro-
ceedings well, they heard them no better for
the steady tramp of disappointed members
of the audience departing from other zones.
Raymond Ellis presented Elijah as a prophet
more of art than power.
At Melbourne King’s Maurice M'oscovitch
continues to break all the rules of melodrama
by presenting a murderer under the name
of Geoffrey. The name of Geoffrey has never
before been associated with homicide on the
stage, in this Showman’s recollection. A
Silas or a Luke might hold a dagger in his
blood-stained hand, but a Geoffrey was never
known to soil his fingers with anything more
lethal than a cream-puff or a cup of tea.

Melbourne Tivoli threw a final laugh after
Olsen and Johnson on Tuesday and then
proceeded to give its attention to the Haney
Dancing Revue, whose steps are more original
than their patter. The Bijou is still teaching
Phil-Smith-osophy to moderate congregations.
How an American husband found his fair
but false wife in another’s arms and man-
aged to forget the spectacle in the embraces
of a Balkan princess is the tale that will
never die this week at Melbourne Majestic.
“The Love Toy” is the title, and Lowell
Sherman the Childe Harold of the story.
Hoyt’s patrons are dividing their attention
unequally between a gazette portraying the
joys and sorrows of group-settlers in West-
ralia, and Antonio Moreno submitting with-
out obvious reluctance to the wiles of the
voluptuous creature who supplies a name to
the picture called “The Temptress.”

Police methods as demonstrated in “The
Third Degree” at the Prince of Wales, Adel-
aide, create a mild wonder that crime still
flourishes in America, Victor Fitzlmrbert as
Captain Clinton, the police officer, being such
a terror to crooks that he wins the compli-
ment of groans from the gallery. At the
Majestic Elsa Scott reali. tically presents a
dreadful flapper in “On the Beach at Wai-
kiki,” and Heather Jones is right at the top
as a dancer and singer. The Lorna Lance
company as a family jazz band, with an
infant drummer aged five, delights the crowd.
“Paradise,” at the York Theatre, is a
potpourri of villains, natives and peers
wrecked on a desert island. Milton Sills
features the Hon. Tony; Betty Bronson sup-
ports him as Chrissie, and a fat Lady George
played by Kate Price fills in the broad
comedy. In “Tin Gods,” at the Wonder-
graph, Thomas Meighan has a fine role as
the young engineer, with a wife who prefers
politics to a family, and a baby that conse-
quently falls out of the window and is killed.
There is an Argentine setting and ( Some
Spanish dances by Renee Adoree. "Exit
Smiling” throws some light on the life of
the mummers who do one-night stunts in
small towns. At the Grand Theatre “The
Million-Dollar Handicap” is being screened,
with the lady jockey riding her father's horse
to victory; “The Sheriff’s Girl” on the same
bill introduces the dog-star Fangs. At
West’s Pictures the fine “Tale of Two Cities
is being told, and the “Phantom of the
Forest” outlined. Sid Halliday and Lina
Watson, two Sydney artists, are exploiting
the Black Bottom and the Argentine tango
at the Palais Royal. Easter attractions
included “The Mikado” at the Royal, "Hie
Silver King” at the Prince of Wales, and
“The .Compass Flirt” at the Wondergraph,
with “Take It from Me” at the York.


STRICKEN WITH ECZEMA.
“For seven years I liad weeping
eczema,” says Miss E. Mack, of
Glanville Blocks P. 0., via Port
Adelaide. “This most painful skin
disease defied all ordinary ointments
and lotions. I thought my skin was
never to be clear and healthy again.
Fortunately I was induced to try
Zam-Buk. The first application of
this balm gave relief from the ter-
rible irritation. I continued to
apply Zam-Buk until all sign of
soreness and eruption was ban-
ished. It’s such a joy to be rid of
the dreadful eczema.”
PILES OPERATION AVERTED
“My bad attack of piles was
brought about through sitting on
wet timber,” says Mr. H. Little, of
hi Boundary Street, Brisbane, “For
months I had great difficulty in
walking about, and the incessant
burning and itching pain was some-
thing dreadful. The doctor strongly
advised operation; friends were
equally certain that Zam-Buk
would do good. So I decided to
try the balm. Zam-Buk proved
wonderful in removing pain, swell-
ing and inflammation, and every day
I persevered with it there was more
improvement. Zam-Buk cured the
piles within three weeks and I have
never been troubled since.”
CRIPPLING LEG ULCERS.
“As a result of a sprain,” says
Mrs. S. A. Darrell, of 27 Levey
Street, Chippendale, Sydney,
“painful ulcers broke out round my
ankle-bone and the foot swelled
until it was impossible to get my
boot on. I got no rest for the burn-
ing and throbbing pain, and I
could-i’t nut my foot to the ground.
Although I applied all sorts of
'remedies’ the limb was bad 15
months. Luckily I was persuaded
to try Zam-Buk, and from the first
it did good. Zam-Buk drew out all
corrupt matter and completely sub-
dued the pain and inflammation,
enabling me to get restful nights.
Through using Zam-Buk and no-
thing else the ulcers were soon
thoroughly healed with strong new
skin.”
ARM FULL OF POISON.
’My right hand was crushed by
a log and the little finger split to
the bone,” says Mr. W. Simpson, of
Annerley Road, South Brisbane. “As
poison spread up into the arm,
painful, hard lumps formed. I was
disabled for a fortnight and the
injury cost me a lot in wages. For-
tunately I was one day persuaded
to try Zam-Buk. This balm did
me a world of good and so perfectly
healed the terrible wound that soon
there wasn’t a mark to be seen.”

WASH DELICATE SKINS WITH ZAM-BUK MEDICINAL SOAP
remains unrivalled for the skin. The relief it
gives is almost miraculous! Smarting pain is stopped,
irritation allayed, inflammation subdued, the tissues are
purified and the growth of new, healthy skin begun.
Zam-Buk’s success is in its refinement, herbal character, and
freedom from rancid fats and coarse mineral drugs.
CHILD’S SCALP DISEASE.
“My little girl suffered dreadfully
with scalp sores,” says Mrs. C.
Cridland, of Gibson Street, South
Banbury, W.A. “From an ordi-
nary mattery pimple on the neck
the trouble developed into a sore
patch which spread all over the
child’s head. Homely ointments
and salves couldn’t check this un-
sightly disease, buf in two days a
small sample of Zam-Buk moved all
pain and irritation. I sent for a
regular size box of Zam-buk and
continued the treatment. In a re-
markably short time Zam-Buk puri-
fied and healed the sores, making
the child’s scalp sweet and healthy.
Zam-Buk wonderfully improved hex-
hair.”
BOY’S SCALDED LEG.
“My boy Freddy scalded his leg
terribly,” says Mrs. E. Watson, of
125 Bathurst Street, Hobart. “The
place blistered and formed a sore
so that he could hardly get about.
Many remedies were tried, but
until we applied Zam-Buk no bene-
fit was apparent. After using two
boxes of the balm the wound was
thoroughly healed.”
PROSPECTORS’ FIRST-AID.
“When up one of the big northern
rivers,” says Mr. .J. Nicholson, of
25 Edward Street, Redfern, N.S.W ~
“a noxious weed stuck half through
my hand. To head off lockjaw and
blood-poison—common dangers in
such injuries—l promptly applied
Zam-Buk. I was confident it would
do good; it extracted all poison, sub-
dued the inflammation, and healed
rapidly and thoroughly.”
HOME ACCIDENTS RISK.
“Through upsetting a bowl of
boiling starch, my foot was badly
scalded,” says Mrs. L. Diercke, 50
Munro Street, Coburg, Melbourne.
“Great blisters formed and after
two days these burst and left the
flesh dreadfully raw and inflamed.
The doctor ordered me to bed for a
fortnight and sent in a supply of
lotion and ointment preparations,
which proved so painful to use,, how-
ever, that I soon had to discon-
tinue with them.
“Remembering we had a sample
box of Zam-Buk, I made use of it.
Even this first dressing of Zam-Buk
took pain out wonderfully, and left
the wounds a deal healthier in
appearance. A large box of Zam-
Buk was bought and further appli-
cations purified and healed the
wounds. With one week’s rest and
the aid of Zam-Buk new skin grew
and my foot was made quite sound
and strong again.”

Lawrence Tibbett, baritone cf the Metropolitan

until one night during' the 1925-26 season, when a
revival of Verdi’s “Falstaif,” in which he scored an
outstanding success, made him famous overnight.
To-day he is unable to fulfil all his concert engage-
ments. There are many recorded versions oi tne
Prologue from “Pagliacei,” but none like this one,
the orchestral accompaniment being a revelation in
itself. The greater part of the first part is taken
up by the entire orchestral introduction to the opera,
which is reproduced with a mighty effect, eclipsing
anything done so far in vocal records. The orchestral
volume does not drown the voice, yet it is louder a''d
richer than any orchestra! record made by the ok!

astonish all who hear it.

Poverty
Point
“Frescott”: The combination of Walter
Cornock and Jefferson Taite in “The Ner-
vous Wreck” brings to mind memories of these
two and of Tal Or dell, Gus Neville, Vera
Remee, Nellie Ferguson and others; but
“Middle Blue” (B. 24/3/’27) is astray as
to the location. It was at the Tivoli, Bris-
bane; the co.—it played there for years—
Avas called the King’s Dramatic Company.
Plorace Nightingale was the s.m. and Cor-
nock the assistant. Few people who saw it
Avill forget Cornock’s impersonation of a
stranded vaudevillain in an extravaganza
called “The Secrets of the Harem,” staged
(I think) at Easter, 1916.
“Flaming Youth”: Paderewski’s secretary,
L. G. Sharpe, has an old acquaintance with
Australia, but it is 30 years since he was
last here; the management of the London
Symphony Orchestra has kept him in Britain.
He made his first visit in 1886 as manager
of the original Fisk Jubilee Singers. They
were uncommonly successful, here and else-
where; and the basso. Louden, who had a
huge salary as well as a share in the profits,
made enough to set himself up as a boot
manufacturer. He left £200.000 when he
died.
“Cfpsar’s Ghost”: The mummer’s drink-
ing habits had exhausted the patience of his
management, but he pleaded for forgiveness.
“We can’t trust you,” said the chief, half
relenting. “You say you won’t get drunk
again; but can a leopard change his spots?”
“Oh, yes,” said the mummer eagerly. “I’m
off the whisky and I’m going to stick to
beer.”
“Caul Boy” : A new variant on the nigger
shamble burst on Australia recently. It
Avas called the “Black Bottom,” and derives
from the river bottoms where the cotton
grows and Mammy and Sambo shuffle around
the camp-fire after the day’s work. Appa-
rently its uncouth-looking name weighed it
down in public estimation, and it seemed to
fade away. Actually only its name was
changed. The dance remains in all its
charming barbarism.
“Hamfat”: “The Woman Pays” (B.
7/4/’27) was produced a decade ago by Ray
Longford for the Southern Cross Feature
Films. This Adelaide venture also filmed
“The Sentimental Bloke” ;it w T as one of the
last of the Australian picture-making con-
cerns (there were-eight in Sydney alone at
one time) to be slaughtered by American
interests. “The Woman Pays” was presented
as “The Woman Suffers”; but it was cen-
sored in N.S.W. on account of the seduction
episode. Thus the Australian producers
were robbed of their just return, although
floods of pictures really salacious were
allowed to pour in from Hollywood.
“Fit-up” : Cabled that an Italian speculator
is fitting up a passenger liner as a combined
theatre, dance hall and restaurant, and will
tour the Avorld with a selected lot of artists,
dancers, bands, etc., giving performances on
board at every important port. The actors
and the less important folk will live on
board the floating theatre, the auditorium of
which Avill seat 1500 people. The shoAV
should be a success, if the odor of garlic in
such a confined space does not kill it.
“Irving Phelps”: In addition to “The
Happy Husband,” mentioned by “L.E.”
(B. 14/4/'27). Harrison Owen may shortly
see staged “The Wages of Virtue,” a snigger-
ing light-hearted comedy full of smart scenes
and crafty dialogue effects which, in the
view of Anthony Prinsep, is better than
Maugham’s “Our Betters.” Considering that
Prinsep, the husband of Marie Lohr, is an
extensive producer with a fondness for the
school of comedy in which Owen is trying to
excel, his opinion is worth having. Owen
seems bound to arrive sooner or later. He
has not given up hopes of still placing his
first-horn, “The Gentleman In Waiting,”
which had a brief flutter at the London
Comedy in 1925. The fact that Owen has
succeeded in interesting such a trio as Dean,
Prinsep and Du Maurier is surely a diploma
of achievement that no other Australian
dramatist except Haddon Chambers has
Avon.
“Irving Phelps”: Leon Gordon professes
a great yearning for a real Aus-
tralian play to take back with him
to America. He doesn’t want another
"Kelly Gang” or “Robbery Under Arms,”
but if anybody offers him a tropical Austra-
lian theme in which he will have the job
of a disillusioned, sarcastic waster who
strangles an abo. Tondeleyo in the last act,
he will demonstrate his gratitude in mor;
than the usual form. Leon Gordon, avlio is
a London Jew, nurses the suspicion that
Nature intended him to take the stage as
a sententious cynic who dashes the hopes
of the young and trustful with devastating
gibes and epigrams. The discovery of this
forte is alleged to have preceded the first
version of “White Cargo" by about two
minutes, whereat the elated dramatist imme-
diately re-wrote the part of Witzel, making
him creep with his loitering leg and his sour
A STAR IN THE PART.
COMEDIAN : “This morning Barnstormer told me I was the choicest
dam' fool he'd, ever set eyes on. How would you regard that.
Montague, old hoy—as a compliment or a holly insult?”
tongue , into almost every situation. Aspir-
ing local dramatists who want to catch the
eye of Gordon are advised to give him
another Witzel —one with a liver about the
size of a tub.
“Lever de Rideau”: Has anybody re-
marked how few free entertainments, or
even open-air entertainments with collec-
tions, there are in a modern city? The only
one I have been able to discover in Mel-
bourne, apart from the Sunday Yarra bank
blitherings, is provided by Miss Uren, who
superintends a factory for ballet girds just
across Princes Bridge. The well-padded
grass plots are an ideal floor for the gym-
nastics ■which pass for modern dancing, and
any evening you may see tiny tots in neat
black doublets turning Catherine wheels,
back somersaults and what not on the sward.
And marvellous little athletes they are!
I have often wondered how the chorus- girl
acquired the ability to do strange evolutions
and look as if she liked doing them. She
does like doing them. It is as hard for their
mistress to call these youngsters away from
their twistings and twirlings as to whistle a
dog off a bone.
“East Mexican”: So Gladys Moncrieff is
torn with anxiety between accepting a
renewed contract from “The Blue Mazurka”
producers in London and a stupendous offer
from unnamed persons in Australia. In
1910 Gladys was glad to get a week’s “sing”
during the intervals of the programme at
West’s open-air picture-show at Charters
Towers (N.Q.). The goldfielders, . mostly
Cornish and Geordies, were a musical lot,
and appreciated the freshness of the young-
ster’s untrained voice. But they then had
a musical prodigy of their own, and were
busy subscribing to send her to the R.C.M.,
London. This young woman is now playing
regularly in a G. and S. provincial co., and
I dare say there is more rejoicing in what is
left of the Towers over her successes in the
provinces than over the storming of London
by Gladys. She was a Towers girl, while
Gladys merely came from Townsville.
“Goldilocks”: I can feel no thrill over
Allan Wilkie’s ambition to produce the whole
37 plays ascribed to Shakspeare, nor would
there be any thrill if it was certain that all
of the plays were Sliakspeare’s. Having pro-
duced 24, Wilkie has done very well.
Oscar Asclie and Lily Brayton thought
"Antony alul Cleopatra” worth while, but
they were the first in Australia to touch it
since the early ’eighties. “The Merchant,”
“Hamlet,” “Lear,” “Julius Ctesar,” “Mac-
beth,” “Othello,” “John,” “Henry _ V.,”
“Richard III.” and “As You Like It” give
opportunities for stars which have kept them
popular. “The Merry Wives of Windsor,”
“Twelfth Night,” “Taming of the Shrew,”
“Comedy of Errors” and “Much Ado About
Nothing” pass as classical comedies. “A
Midsummer Night’s Dream” is produced as
a spectacle, and “The Tempest” for its poeti-
cal excellence. Of the others this writer
would most like to see “Coriolanus”; but at
one production in London a class-conscious
audience hooted the star off the stage.
“Two Seas” : As an old cocky may I be
allowed to say wliat I think of “On Our
Selection”? I was up to my neck in the
game when Steele Rudd’s joke was first
published. In my opinion, any man who
maintains that Dad
and his lunatic
tribe fairly repre-
sent the men who
cleared and fenced
and made prosper-
ous homes out of
the virgin bush,
only exhibits his
ignorance of the
bush. Dairying and
pig-farming or any
other farming were
never carried on in
Dad’s style—even
on wayback selec-
tions. It was this
knowledge that pro-
moted me to pro-
test in The Bul-
letin against the
fool thing being-
played in the Eng-
-1 i s h provinces,
where it naturally
had a retarding
effect upon migra-
tion to Australia.
The “On Our Selec-
tion” uproar bursts
out periodically be-
cause the yarn was
written to amuse
townies, and they
took it seriously as
a true picture of
pioneer life. I feel
sure that Steele
Rudd knows better.
I have in my scrap-
book a yarn of his
en tille d “One
Night,” which ap-
peared in The Bul-
let isr about 30
years ago, and it
is one of the host and truest descriptions
of a bush incident that ever saw print.
“Hamfat”: On a recent free Sunday night
a visiting mummer, who thinks himself a
star, went to the house of some newly-made
Sydney friends and found himself involved
in a social gathering to which, under duress,
he recited. Later he found himself seated by
a talkative lady who obviously didn’t know
his name. “X did want to say how much X
liked your recitation,” she said. “Do you
know, I really think you ought to try to
go on the stage—l’m certain vou’d have no
difficulty in getting a small part.”
“The Old Adam” : What a commentary on
theatrical enterprise in this country is pro-
vided by Mary E. Fullerton in her article
(R.P. 7/4/’27) on “The Six Best Modern
Plays”! Not one of the pieces selected by
the lady and St. John Ervine —nigh a score
in all— has been seen on our stage, At_ the
annual dinner of the London Gallery First-
Nighters Club the president gave a list of
plays which he considered the best of the
year. lie included one production mentioned
by both Miss Fullerton and Mr. Ervine —
Clemence Dane’s “Granite” ; the others were
O’Casey’s “The Plough and -the Stars” ; “Dis-
tinguished Villa,” by a new writer, Kate
O’Brien; “Interference,” by Ronald Pertwee
and Harold Dearden; ,T. Bernard Fagan’s
Pepys comedy “And So to Bed” ; “The Con-
stant Nymph,” by Margaret Kennedy and
Basil Dean; “Berkeley Square,” by J. C.
Squire and J. L. Balderston: and Eden
Phillpotts’s “Yellow Sands.” Shall we see
any of these notable plays in Australia?
“Hamfat”: An onlooker when the Sydney
Criterion audience poured its tributes on
Nellie Stewart was Docie Stewart, whom
in the early days the Stewart family ranked
a little higher than Nellie. Docie was the
girl with the voice, but she lacked her sister’s
all-round capacity. As a youngster I saw
Nellie and Docie, Pa Stewart and son Dick
(now a house-manager) all together in a
production of “Sinbad the Sailor,” spat-
tered with topical stuff. Docie became Mrs.
Camboissier. A son accompanied her from
Melbourne to watch Nellie’s success.
“Curtain Raiser” : The Taits are running
no undue risks with their gran’-opera season
which opens in September. Dal Monte,
Scavizzi and Granforte are old friends. As
some of those mentioned have a limited
vocabulary, judging by their previous per-
formances, Dal Monte may be expected to
appear in most of the roles she made her own
when in Australia before. Scavizzi gave a
melodramatic intensity to “Da Tosca,” and
doubtless she will be heard again in that
melodious thriller. As humorous bassos are
hard to find in Italy—which takes itself seri-
ously these days—Azzolini, the comic basso,
has been re-engaged.
“A.G.M.” (Lond.) : Jan Kiepura, a Polish
tenor who made a sensation in Germany
last year, has sung for the first time in
England at the Albert Hall. He is unquestion-
ably a great tenor, with only such defects as
experience can easily rectify. The voice,
without a break, is of fine lyric quality,
capable of rendering robust numbers; the
most there is to cavil at is a vibrato which
should disappear speedily. The young fellow’s
breath-control is remarkable, and in youth-
ful pride of this gift he often spins
a note out to an almost inaudible whisper.
Bonci used to enthral the house in the same
way. Jan is dark, of medium height and
build, with a fine forehead. Australia will
hear him, I daresay, in 1957.
“Hamfat” : London is to see “Abie’s Irish
Rose,” which has finished a run of five years
in New York. The Brummagem mass of senti-
ment and vaudeville humor has paid its
authoress better than literary gold could;
Annie Nichols is said to have made a million
dahlers out of the play, without reckoning
in the film rights, which have been sold
lately.
“Curtain Raiser” : Lesbianism is the theme
of the banned play, “La Prisonniere,” by
Eugene Bourdet, whose subject the cable
from N’York couldn’t mention. One of the
filthy females never appears on the stage:
she is represented by a bunch of violets, sent
by a messenger—an innocent-looking sum-
mons which her victim instantly obeys. In
the N’York cast a success was scored by
Arthur Wontner, who was in Australia with
►Superbus Knight.
“Black Out”: Tal Ordell, now directing
films, turned down an offer to go into Yankee
pictures some years ago because he saw
possibilities here. He has had nothing to
complain about in his luck, which includes
a staged play of his own and “The Kid
Stakes,” a picture which has been privately
presented. Like Adam Lii Isay Gordon, Tal
was literally thrown off a horse into the
limelight. Gordon found his vocation in
verse, and Ordell in greasepaint; but steeple-
chase riding was the beginning.
“John’s Wood” (Lond.) : In support of a
Thomas Beecham article on Delius, Percy
Grainger has written to the London press,
placing the neglected English genius at the
head of all living composers and among "the
transcendent creative musical giants of all
time.” About 25 years ago the supremacy
of Delius was the pet theme of a small circle
of artistic people in London, all known or
born in Australia, including A,my Sherwin,
Minna Fischer, George Clutsam, Hugo Gor-
litz, Adey Brunei, Norman Brunei and Tom
Jackson. Delius often met this little gather-
ing of worshippers at their modest reunions,
but in those days it was difficult to persuade
anybody that a native musician might be a
genius.
“Country Ped” : I have been studying the
actions of my two young hopefuls, boy and
girl, at the movies. Knockabout slap-stick
sends them into rollicking peals of laugh-
ter ; but sentimental scenes bore them stiff.
They would sooner watch farces than any-
thing else, very likely because the imp of
mischief is in the ascendant, and things are
done to other people that they would glory
in doing themselves —if they had the chance.
No particular hero or heroine is ever singled
out for special mention; they are interested
in the mass. Crowd scenes move them
strangely. Yet not once have I seen them
in their play afterwards attempt to re-act
any of the mannerisms of any screen actor.
Apparently they receive so many fleeting im-
pressions that nothing is firmly implanted in
their minds. But, if the movies have no
baneful effects at present, shall I he able
to say the same when my children reach the
pulsing age of adolescence? Will false senti-
ment and intrigue and crooked values ot
life, as they are so often depicted, have any
harmful effects then? I am afraid they will.
THANKSGIVING.
[FOR THE BULLETIN. ]
Thank the gods for a gramophone
That I can hear in my house alone,
And never know the diva’s smirk,
Or the bass perspiring at his work,
And never share in the agony
Of the tenor toiling up to G,
Nor watch the ’cello-player make
Herself a snobbish sort of snake,
Nor see the violinist’s eyes
Roll rheumy whites, nor hear the sighs
Out of the starched-in second burst
For the place of the fool who’s playing first.
Ah, gods, my thanks for a gramophone
Of modest mood and a gentle tone,
That’s glad enough of its melody,
And never turns affectedly
To smirk or bow or bend to me,
But plays away, and hides from mirth
All tenors six-feet round the girth,
Each double-chin and bulbous breast,
The over-rouged and over-dressed,
The paltry human frailties,
Conceits and cares and jealousies;
Ah, I am very sure it knoAvs
My heart dies at each rapturous close,
And that it croons away all night,
Delighted in my last delight.

Chanson Triste.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
IN the springtide of youth, when the roses
were sweet in the garden of time,
When life was a song whose deep
cadence uncloses and love was the
rhyme;
When the goddess of gracious September
tript light ’mid the blades of the grass,
The gold of her feet like the glow of an
ember about a green glass—-
Then I too awoke from dead dreaming of
dawns and of days long dead,
To know' but the sense of the sunlight a-
streaming far over my head.
In the springtide of youth, when the roses
were sweet in the garden of time,
When life was a song whose deep cadence
uncloses, and love was the rhyme.
When the last of the lilies are fading, and
frosts are chill in the air,
Rose-petals are strewn, and the sweet mas-
querading of beauty laid bare;
When evens grow dim and days darken, and
music falls hushed and is dumb,
Lips part....and the waiting heart gladly
would hearken.... but words never
come—
Then needs must I weep, child of sorrow, for
you were my rose and my queen,
And when shall a man find re-born on a
morrow the days that have been?
When the last of the lilies are fading, and
frosts are chill in the air,
llose-petals are strewn, and the sweet mas-
querading of beauty laid bare.

The Depths of Delia.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ON days when the heat turns business
or sport into a bit of a burden, or
when persistent rain has made of life
merely one damp thing after another, it is
the custom of many good citizens to drop
into one of our vast hotels or restaurants
for a tonic. Those of us who are pressed
for time drop a shilling on the bar, pour
cut a regular nigger, and, having consumed
it, pass on with a comforting glow in the
vitals; but those who seek mental and
moral as well as physical uplift wisely pause
near the entrance, and await the arrival of
one of those dear gossips who pack the place
every afternoon. Having secured one, the
procedure is simple. Order tea or cocktails,
open your cigarette-case, and your guest
will do the rest.
There are several good resorts for this
form of diversion. The Strafford, the Pleni-
potentiaries and the Royalist all have their
attractions; but for a really rich discourse on
the immorality of your fellow-citizens there
is no place like the big winter-garden of
the Polynesia, where the tables are so close
together that, if the titbits of your own
friend are insufficiently piquant, you can,
Hy merely cocking one ear backwards, tune
in to the tartare taradiddles of the fast cat
behind you; who, having observed your
arrival by means of the mirror in her
vanity-case, is privately speculating as to
whether any special significance can pos-
sibly be attached thereunto.
In the lounge of the Polynesia, then, I
recently met my dear friend, Mrs. Spiker-
Sharp, who, as you probably know, is the
greatest living authority on the curious
and interesting folklore of Darling Point.
And, as the tide slowly ebbed, as it were,
from the sleek sides of the olives, she told
me, among other tales, the story which I
have set down here in my own fashion.
When John Courtenay Workham laid his
heart and hand at the silk-and-snakeskin
feet of Delia Hubert, we all knew that
trouble would come of it; for he was the
only son of his father, and she a widow.
Not that there is anything to be said
against widows, as such; nor could a great
deal be said against Delia Hubert which
had not originated in the minds of sundry
envious and gossipy cats. But poor Delia
served as a peg on which many such action-
able anecdotes were hung. Only two years
older than John Courteney, she was slim,
demure, and, above all, fascinating from
the top of her beautifully shingled little
head to the toes of her faultless little shoes;
her complexion was always alluringly
adjusted to the time and place; and, especi-
ally when she sank into a deep and cosy
chair, she displayed a silken limb which
would have elicited admiring comments
from the most blase of producers or ’bus-
conductors. These natural attributes might
have been overlooked by the Cat Brigade,
but her clothes simply demanded atten-
tion, What there was was good—very
good; and, of course, everybody knows that
the late Mr. Hubert’s will—drawn up at the
time of his marriage—was subsequently
regarded more as a record of excellent in-
tentions than of actual and negotiable be-
quests.
( “like a fish, my dear, and I know for
a fact that Coralie Granvitesse, the singer,
you know, never paid the rent for her 'flat
when she came to Sydney.” Thus Mrs.
Spiker-Sharp.)
But our real worry was over Billy Pen-
silla. (Old Cornish family. Came out here
centuries ago. Associated with the opening
of our first racecourse. First generation
took to the bush, and the second to the
land.) You see, not only had Billy been
one of Delia’s most fervent adorers, which
didn’t matter much, but Delia had suddenly
and unaccountably gone completely kooka-
burra over Billy, which mattered a great
deal. Billy’s fine atavistic instincts
prompted him to breed horses, and, on his
nice little property at Bannock, he bred
to the delight of his mortgagees—a leggy
and loose-coupled type of animal which
usually required the services of a black
tracker to find out which way the others
had gone. Anyhow, realising that prospec-
tive matrimony with Delia called for an
extra special effort, Billy divorced old
barren Reason, and backed his mare Tryla
for about five years’ income. Crashing on
that, through sheer bad luck, he rashly
placed most of his real estate and personal
effects on the same animal for the Cup, and
was roused to frenzy when the poor beast
failed to carry the weight.
He faced Delia like a sport, and pain-
fully explained that until either Uncle Tom
or Cousin Jack joined the great army of
Pensillas somewhere on the Other Side, his
only hope was to go in for jackerooing and
land-ballots. Delia faced him like a sport,
told him to go ahead, and never, never to
believe anything he might hear.
Fortune favored them. Within a year,
Delia received a hysterical letter from Billy
announcing that he’d drawn absolutely the
best block on the Didya Downs subdivision,
had arranged agistment for three months at
a profiteering rental, and, if he could only
raise, say, another thousand somehow on
the prospects, they could set up a home
straight away. Delia kissed the letter, pon-
dered over it for half a day, and con-
trived to get an introduction to John Cour-
tenay Workham.
Old John Workham was born in humble
circumstances, but a benevolent Providence
had endowed him with all the essentials
common to such creatures as American oil-
kings and grey-nurse sharks. The employ-
ment of these talents at an early age char-
acterised John’s activities in both industry
and sport, and contributed in no small
degree to his worldly success. He invented
a novel and ingenious system of book-
keeping which he applied to his employers’
petty-cash account, and judiciously invested
the resulting surplus on a horse which was
out to catch the judge’s eye for the first
and last time in its racing career. With
the nice little sum thus obtained, John
hastily quitted his clerkly duties, and be-
came an independent battler in the ranks
of business. At fifty-five he retired to a
beautiful mansion at Dear Point, a plethoric
bank-account, a limousine half the length
of the street, and the fruition of his hopes
of posterity.
Not that John junior was remarkably
fruity, as it were; or, at least, he may pos-
sibly have been ravaged by codlin-moth,
woolly-aphis or some similar blight, recov-
ery from which is both uncertain and pro-
tracted. John senior greatly desired to
behold his heir posing in plus-fours on the
exclusive putting-greens of Lily Bay ;
whereas John junior’s aptitudes lay more
in the direction of nosing in Oxford bags
round caravanserais and cabarets. It may
be that in selecting this form of diversion
he showed a certain amount of discretion,
for a highball is an improvement on a
blackball any way you take it. ( “and
Violet told me in strict confidence that old
W. passed Jack a Stock Exchange tip worth
hundreds in the hope of getting the horrid
little rabbit’s name on the waiting list.”)
Be that as it may, it was in one of these
haunts of pleasure that John junior met
Delia, danced with her, fell for her, aban-
doned his strictly dishonorable intentions
towards her, and finally flopped in.
Very late in the evening, as they parted
at. the door of her flat, and after Delia had
given him a good-night kiss, into which she
contrived to infuse a dainty promissory-
note, so to speak, of connubial felicity to
come, and John had to be rebuked, she
whispered to him that it would be so roman-
tic to keep their little secret to themselves
for the first fragrant week or two.
“We won’t tell even your dad,” she said.
“And, dearest, we mustn’t be seen together
all the time, or people will guess. But,”
she added, “you can send me a dear little
note every morning—if you like.”
Needless to say, John gloried in this
privilege. ( “and she’d lodged all the let-
ters with Bill Gongay, the K.C., so I got
matey for a while with his confidential
typiste. Got her an invitation to the Bang-
Wang picnics, though, of course, she didn’t
go, and she told me that of all the” .)
Let us, after the fashion of Professor Ein-
stein, imagine a curve or a kink in space
and time. We are now two weeks ahead,
and present in the dining-room of the pater-
nal Workham at Dear Point. Old John
has dined, and with bloodshot eye balefully
regards the Fruit—John junior I mean;
not the dessert. Old John’s excellent dinner
is at present causing him some discomfort,
having apparently solidified as soon as re-
ceived. He is quite aware that this sense
of petrifaction, as it were, is due merely
to a supercharged digestive tract, and that
it will shortly pass away with those inter-
nal grumblings and mutterings frequently
heard in the vicinity of elderly persons of
a full habit of body; but, in the meantime,
it doesn’t improve his temper.
According to his custom, old John fired
the first shot.
“What’s this I hear about you and some
dam woman named Hubert?” he snarled.
“Do you think you’re engaged to her?”
John junior wilted a little more than
usual. The precious little secret was obvi-
ously out. However, he contrived to emit
an assenting bleat.
“Well,” snapped his sire, “you’re not!”
“Oh, but, Dad, we are, you know.”
“I say you’re not! Low woman like that!’’
“Oh, Dad, not low!”
I have said that old John was of humble
origin and, when properly roused, his lan-
guage became unfit for print as it reverted to
type. Anyhow, he made a comprehensive
survey of the depths of the sea, the bowels

of the earth and the anatomy of snakes in
a spirited endeavor to express the profundity
of Mrs. Hubert’s lowness.
“But, Dad, I’ve promised.”
“Promised? Gorramighty, have you writ-
ten anything to her?”
“Just little notes.”
Old John’s timing-gear came unstitched, as
it were. But from the resulting welter of
staccato explosions and muffled howls
several definite statements emerged. These
were to the effect that John junior was to
proceed at once to the confines of Gehenna;
that if he tarried on the way to exchange
word or look with Mrs. - Hubert he would
thereafter proceed at his own expense; and
that old John proposed to pay an immediate
call on a completely catalogued lady of
rapacious disposition and quite unmention-
able morals, whom John junior correctly
guessed to be his adored Delia.
As the condemned banana plops drearily
into the depths of the ocean, so did the
unfortunate Fruit, after a brief whirl through
the air in a Pink Taxi, splash and submerge
in the radiant sea of paper caps, balloons,
streamers and flying corks which tossed
within the bright walls of the Plenipoten-
tiaries; while, in the well-appointed garage
of the Dear Point mansion, a quivering
chauffeur caught the message on the tele-
phonette just before the wire fused, and
leaped wildly into the Rolls.
It was Delia herself who opened the
' door to the simmering John senior. Delia,
who, having worked out the times beauti-
fully from the hour she told the secret, had
prepared for emergencies by donning her
very newest and most gorgeous raiment.
( “and, my dear, Poussin’s head man told
Maud Carthews that it was only proper
and pious to give God’s masterpiece pre-
cedence over his own, so there was more
Delia than frock to catch the eye.”)
Old John was considerably taken aback,
and, instead of unloosing the torrent of
hasty language which was straining on the
verge of utterance, he tripped the dams, so
to speak, into a corner of his system where
they could be found again if necessary, and
prepared for negotiation instead of battle.
So we find him ten minutes later warily
approaching the point of his theme.
“Anyhow,” he remarked, “a nice bright
girl like you would be bored stiff with my
son in no time. No merry chatter about
him, and”
“Oh, but I love strong, silent men!” cried
Delia.
John utterly failed to visualise his off-
spring as a strong, silent man.
“You know,” continued Delia, “it’s really
only Johnny’s shyness.” She looked pensive
“He writes perfectly wonderful letters.
Some' of them may be—well, just a little
bit cinnamon, but I often think they should
be published some day. They’d look won-
derful in print.”
John successfully visualised the letters in
print—on the front pages of the snappier
journals. No mistake, the young devil had
brains.
“Quite so,” he said. “Now, Mrs. Hubert,
I know that a young and romantic girl like
yourself naturally feels it keenly when cir-
cumstances render her dearest wishes im-
possible. But a blow of Fate on the solar
plexus is something we must just try to
get over as soon as we can. Now, in view
of your sad disappointment, I should really
recommend a little trip—say to Colombo —
until the first shadows have lifted. If you
will give me the privilege of arranging the
necessary finance, say a couple of
hundr”
He caught Delia’s eye. The old-family-
adviser sort of talk wasn’t going down.
“I. was saying,” he resumed, “that a couple
of months in the Old Country wouldn’t be
a bad idea. I’ll fix it up for you. Two
hundred for fares and three hundred for
clothes and pocket-money makes it five.”
He caught Delia’s eye once more. He
remembered that the last breach-of-promise
actions between people in Delia’s walk —or
speedway—of life had galloped gaily into
thousands. Such a dam pretty kid, too. The
jury might get a gay feeling, and be per-
fectly reckless with his money.
“Well?” he queried.
“Fifteen,” said Delia, softly but dis-
tinctly. “Fifteen hundred, or—l call you
Dad.”
Old John gulped hard, but he hadn’t
made his money by not knowing when he
was beaten.
“And suppose I give you that,” he
growled, “wat’ll you call me then?”
Delia slipped over to him, with shining
eyes.
“A perfect old darling,” she murmured.
( “so she wired to Billy on the day she
got the cheque, was measured at Winkson’s
for three pairs of riding-breeches by way of
a trousseau, caught the Western Mail, and
that’s the last we saw of her. Manhattan
this time, please,” said Mrs. Spiker-Sharp.)
C.D.T.
The Horse-dealer.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
ALEC STEVENS, the manager of Ups-
andowns station, was a worried man.
Seated on the top rail he watched
several horses padding slowly around the
breaking-in yard beneath him.
One horse in particular claimed Alec’s
attention, for this round-barrelled black,
which stood apart from the lest and lazily
switched a tail, was the cause of most of
the boss’s present worries.
“The blankard! ” soliloquised Stevens, as he
allowed his gaze to linger on the physically
faultless quadruped. “The blankard! To
think that such a well-proportioned horse,
bred fit to win a Melbourne Cup, should
prove such an outlaw! Let’s see,” he mur-
mured, and began to count with his fingers.
“First. Jack Kelly was pitched and broke
a collar-bone, 't hen Peter Wise got a boot
in the ribs as he rode the saddle to the
‘floor.’ Black Charlie gets chucked twice
unhurt. And now, not ten minutes ago, the
best rider in the district, Ted Tomkins, gets
carted to town with a broken arm. You
swine! You won’t break anyone else up,
I’ll bet a quid. If I can’t sell or trade you
to some mug, I’ll put you in with the
draught team or damn well shoot you!
Don’t forget.... I want to get some of the
sixty quid back I paid for you as a year-
ling.”
Suddenly the horses pricked up their ears
and evinced a lively interest in something
far down the road. Following their gaze
with his own Stevens no deed little puffs
of red dust ascending from the ground as a
rider leading a pack-horse approached.
Presently the horseman arrived at the
yards, and, hopping from the saddle,
tethered his two horses to the rails. Then,
tightening his belt, he sauntered up to
Alec Stevens.
“Goo’day,” he drawled; then, perceiving
the man on the railtop wore a tie, he con-
tinued : “Can y’ tell me where th’ boss
o’ this place is?”
Alec Stevens took a rapid survey of the
newcomer. Everjdhing was noted, from the
unshaven face with two bright blue eyes to
the slim hips and cross-roll spurs on the
elastic-side riding-boots. Then Stevens
spoke.
“I’m the boss here. What can I do for
you?”
“Well,” answered the other, “I’d like
some meat and flour. I’m a bit short.”
“Call at the store,” said the manager;
“the book-keeper will fix you up.” Then,
noticing that the newcomer was looking
intently at the horses in the yards, lie went
on: “You don’t want to trade any of
your horses, do you, by any chance?”
The traveller climbed up beside him be-
fore answering. “Aw, we might do a deal
—providin’ I have th’ pick of th’ yard, fer
both mine are bloods. Also providin’ I c’n
ride me pick.”
Alec Stevens slipped down from his
perch and walked to the traveller's horses.
Instantly he was attracted by the pack-
horse. The animal showed more breeding
than the best of his, and his quick eye per-
ceived what he had been seeking for months
—the ideal picnic racehorse.
Casually he returned to the rail-top.
“Well,” he said, “you can have the pick of
my lot, and, if you ride it, I have the pic-
of yours. Is that a bargain?”
1 he other nodded and commenced to loch
over the horses, while Stevens hoped more
than he had hoped for ages that the man
would overlook the black outlaw.
Descending from the rail, the traveller
walked through the whirling horses for ,
few moments, then returned to the fern-
“ Boss,” he said, looking up at Stevens,
“the black horse is my pick. I’ll run him in
the next yard an’ get me saddle.”
Mournfully Stevens nodded his head in
acquiescence, and while the young man
went for his saddle cursed inwardly that
the outlaw should have been chosen, in
consequence of which he felt sure lie would
lose the chance of obtaining the best picnic
horse he had seen for a long time.
Shortly the traveller returned, and in a
few minutes the black was in the crush
with the saddle on, and the round yard
cleared for the fray.
Stevens was on the point of telling tin-
man the black’s history, and thus easing his
conscience; but the sublime confidence with
which the stranger went about his business
made the manager resolve to let the pros-
pective rider have a fling unenlightened.
By this time several station-hands had
collected, and while someone held the out-
law’s head the traveller climbed into the
saddle. When firmly seated he cried: “Let
’im go, lads,” and the next instant the
scrap was on.
At the first buck the men around the
yard realised that here was a horseman, and
commenced to cheer. When the rider
started to punish the horse with his spurs
the stockmen roared their delight. Alec
Stevens could not control his admiration,
and when the black finally surrendered,
panting and in a lather of foam, the man-
ager was the first to greet the rider- as he
stepped from the saddle.
Hours later, in front of the store, after
the traveller had partaken of a meal and
been supplied with rations preparatory to
continuing on his way, Alec Stevens came
out of his office and walked to where the
young man was filling his saddle-bags with
the supplies.
“Do you know,” said Stevens to the
traveller, “I have been wondering why you
traded your pack-horse for the black there '
In every way I have the better of the
deal.”
Grinning from ear to ear the young
fellow turned around. “Well, boss,” he
chuckled, “I guess that’s a matter oi
opinion. Y’ see, I c’n ride th’ black dead-
easy, but I’m damned if I c’n sit two bucks
of th’ blankard you picked!”
Then, stepping into the saddle, he wheeled
into the road and ambled away, leading his
new pack-horse.

■ il MOTOR MOWER
AT SPECIAL CUT PRICES FOR THE
1926 SEASON.
The “ATCO” will make a very strong appeal to those faced with the neces-
sity of keeping in order large areas of turf, i.e., secretaries of cricket, golf, lawn
tennis, and bowling clubs, proprietors of estates of an acre or more, members of
park committees, hotelkeepers. &c.
It is fitted with a 2|-h.p. engine, which develops more than sufficient power
both to propel the machine and operate the cutter, thus requiring only one at-
tendant for guiding purposes.

struction, is remarkably low. Ah operator can very easily and completely cut
1000 square yards of turf on a fuel consumption of a quarter-pint of petrol and
oil mixture.
A twin silencer and an extra exhaust pipe (turned sideways to avoid annoy-
ance to operator) ensure extra quiet running of engine.

the Australian market, we are offering them for season 1926 at specially reduced
