Tlx© Influenza Fiend!
For such must be considered the living: organism which .by its rapid, propagation has spread disease and death
throughout the limits of the civilised world. The scientists of the period have attributed the prevalence and
transmission of this influenza epidemic to the action of quickly propagating germs, and although keen-eyed and
learned men in England, France and Germany have been searching for this microscopic mischief with unstinting
labour, they have not yet succeeded in isolating the individual germ and learning his habits, his food and his
poison. In the meantime, with no Uncertain note, leading physicians in London have recognised in the Austra-
lian Oil of Eucalyptus a germicide that has been pronounced both a preventive of and a cure tor Influenza.
In the Lancet of 18th January, 1890, Dr. W. Stephenson Richmond, of Kensington, London, writes;—
“As to the treatment, preventive and curative, I believe enough has not been said about the former.
Believing influenza to be due to a germ, and generally preceded by catarrh, I assume preventive medioine-should
aim at destruction of the germ and relief of the congestion. I believe for the former there is nothing to surpass
eucalyptus oH during the present epidemic. I believe it is absolutely preventive, and my experience and observa-
tion of it are not confined to the present epidemic. Eucalyptus destroys the germs,.and added to ammonia, which
stimulates the local circulation, forms the best inhalent for the prevention of the disease I yet know of. I thihk
it vastly superior to menthol.”—(Signed), W. Stephenson Richmond, M.R.C.S.
In February, 1890, Dr. Brendon Curgenven writes in the Lancet.
To the Editor of the Lancet : “ I can fully endorse the experience of Mr. Stephenson Richmond in the use of
Eucalyptus as a preventive of influenza, as recommended by him in the Lancet of 18th January. I have from the
beginning of the epidemic used Eucalyptus disinfectant spray on the handkerchief as a perfume by day, and
sprinkled on the bed pillow for inhalation at night, and have found it most effectual in preventing influenza. In
the cases of old people and invalids, I have directed the spray to be used in their rooms at intervals in the day,
and sprinkled on their pillows at night, and I am convinced I have saved many from the disease, when their
servants, who have not taken these precautions, liave had it. I have not had the disease myself, although I have
attended upwards of 200 cases. I have experienced the effects of a large dose of the poison several times after
visiting houses where there were many cases. I felt considerable nausea, like that of sea-sickness, and such dizzi-
ness that I could scarcely walk straight, together with great languor. All these symptoms passed away on In-
haling the Eucalyptus with strong inspirations until its warmth could be felt in the chest. It will as effectually
destroy the poisons of other inf scions diseases and fevers, and I hope to bring the subject of the use of eucalyptus
in infeetious diseases before the Epidemiological Society on 12th March, when I shall prove its powerful effect on
the scarlet fever poison.” — l am, sir, yours faithfully, (Signed), J. Brendon Chroe'nven, Bayswater, Ist February,
1890.
Bosisto’s “ Parrot,” Brand is both curative and preventive. Its antiseptic principle immedi-
ately destroys all poisonous germs. v
Mr. Joseph Bosisto was the first to distil and introduce eucalyptus oil into Europe, and his oil may be known
by the trada-fharg, the “ Parrot” brand. He first exhibited his eucalyptus oil at the Paris Exhibition of 1855,
then again in the London Exhibition of 1861, receiving the highest honours for his exhibits. In 1886, the Society
of Arts, Manufactures, and Commerce hf London (incorporated by Royal Charter in 1847, and established in 1754)
conferred on Mr. Bosisto the silver medal of the society in recognition of his service* ‘to medicine and the arts hi
introducing the eucalyptus of the Australian flora into the commerce of Eifrope.
From the earliest years of its introduction into Europe Bosisto’* oil of eucalyptus has filled the European
demand, and will he found in the dispensaries-of all the hospitals, and in the laboratories erf all the leading
chemists of Europe.
Bosisto’s “ PARROT ” brand Eucalyptus Oil has as trade mark a parrot on the top of the wrapper. See yon
get this from your chemist, and so avoid imitations.

adapted for residential purposes. Nature seems to have
lavished all her varied charms on BUCKINGHAM PARK,
Which is, without exception, the CREAM or PICKED
SPOT on the BLUE MOUNTAINS.
BUCKINGHAM PARK ESTATE
Is beautifully surveyed. The Allotments are unusually
large—from 100 up to 180 feet frontages, with long depths
—thus enabling buyers to have Garden, Tennis Lawns,
etc., if they so desire. In fact, it may be truly said, there
is no finer Residential Land on the Mountains.
The BELGRAVIA HOTEL, MBDLOW, which cost £4OOO,
is now open for visitors, and is the First Hotel on the
Mountains supplied with the Electric Light, and the
Proprietor is willing to supply any cottages built on the
estate with the electric light. Two elegant Villas are
now nearly finished on this estate. The rapid advance in
the price of land at BLACKHEATH during the past three
years, amounting to fully 300 per cent., clearly shows that
early buyers at Buckingham Park will make a splendid
investment. Title is TORRENS, and the terms are liberal
and to suit buyers. For particulars, apply to the Pro-

over-work, mental worry, &c., and contains a fund of use-
ful information for every sufferer from the following com-
plaints, viz : —Loss of Energy and Will Power, NERVOUS
DEBILITY, Pains in the Back, Defective Memory, Specks

If the patient’s case is of long standing, and, therefore
in need of treatment, he should lose no time in writing

which I will at once reply, explaining the nature of his
complaint, and if I can effect a cure, the time it will take,
and the cost of doing so. My long experience in the
treatment of Nervous Diseases has made me thoroughly
conversant with all their peculiarities. I am prepared,
therefore, to
tewtei a Permanent and Complete Cure in every case I undertake,
I invite the fullest investigation into my qualifications. For some time I was House Surgeon to the Great
Northern Hospital, London, where I had special opportunities of investigating the causes of Nervous Diseases, and
bee ime perfectly acquainted with the most approved scientific and successful methods of affecting their cure.
ALL CONSULTATIONS, either by letter or in person, FREE. Hoars of Consultation—From 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.

This eminent Specialist, Founder, and Chief
Surgeon of the long-established and favourably-
known Dispensary that now boars his name, re-
ceived his medical education in the leading colleges
and hospitals of Europe. He has devoted a life-
time to the study of
PRIVATE, NERVOUS. AND SKIN
DISEASES.
He has by profound research thoroughly investi-
gated their origin, traced their deadly sources and
insidious dissemination, and ascertained the surest
and safest methods by which they may be eradi-
cated, with these widely recognised qualifications
combined with unswerving faithfulness to his
patients, he has during his practice, extending
over FORTY YEARS, attained a well-deserved
pre-eminence in their treatment. His practice
embraces diseases which probably cause more un-
happiness than any other class of troubles that

DR, KELLY’S REPUTATION IS SO THOROUGHLY ESTABLISHED THAT IT WILL
ONLY BE NECESSARY FOR HIM TO INTIMATE THAT HE IS PRACTISING AS A
SPECIALIST TO BE APPRECIATED AS A BENEFACTOR TO SUFFERING MANKIND. AS
THE GREATER PORTION OP THE NEW SOUTH WALES PUBLIC IS AWARE, DR. KELLY
IS A LEGALLY QUALIFIED AND REGISTERED PHYSICIAN, AND HAS BY FAB THE
LARGEST PRACTICE IN THE COLONIES. MANY PERSONS AT A DISTANCE, HOWEVER,
ARB UNAWARE OP HIS GREAT SUCCESS, AS, HITHERTO, HE HAS REFRAINED FROM
ADVERTISING. HENCE, TO WIDEN THE SPHERE OF HIS USEFULNESS, HE HAS
DETERMINED, BY MEANS OP ADVERTISING, TO MAKE HIMSELF KNOWN IN REMOTE
DISTRICTS WHERE HIS REPUTATION MAY NOT YET HAVE TRAVELLED. AS THE
QUESTION MAY ARISE, WHY DOES SO EMINENT A PHYSICIAN AS DR. KELLY FIND
IT NECESSARY TO ADVERTISE, HE MAY REPLY TO ONE AND ALL AS FOLLOWS
IF THERE IS A PERSON ON EARTH TO BE PITIED IT IS HE WHO IS OBLIGED
TO ASSOCIATE WITH HIS FELLOW BEINGS WHILE HIS MIND IS CONSTANTLY
HARASSED AND TORTURED BY THE CONSCIOUSNESS OP
WHAT MUST INEVITABLY FOLLOW.
HE LOOKS HAGGARD AND SHEEPISH. HE IS NERVOUS IN PUBLIC, AND EXTREMELY
GIRLISH AND BACKWARD IN LADIES’ SOCIETY. THE VICTIM OP THIS, THE MOST
DANGEROUS OP ALL VICES, IP NOT RELIEVED, SOON REACHES A STATE WHICH MUST
END IN LIFE-LONG MISERY. HE MUST ULTIMATELY SINK TO THE LOWEST STAGE
OP DEGRADATION AND SHAME. DR. KELLY MAINTAINS THAT THE PHYSICIAN WHO
HAS THE POWER TO CURE, AND REMAINS SILENT, IS GUILTY OP AN UNPARDONABLE
SIN OP OMISSION. PERSONS WHO READ HIS GREAT WORK ON THIS SUBJECT WILL
BE SHOWN THE INEVITABLE RESULT OP THE BAD HABITS, AND IN MOST
INSTANCES SUFFICIENTLY EARLY IN LIFE TO ENABLE THEM
TO SEE THEIR FOLLY
BEFORE ANY DISEASE HAS TAKEN POSSESSION OP THEM, THE BOOK WILL ALSO
SHOW THEM CLEARLY
HOW TO CURE THE DISEASE WITHOUT
THE ASSISTANCE OF PHYSICIAN OR CHEMIST.
MANY PERSONS WONDER WHY THEIR MEMORY IS NOT SO RETENTIVE, AND THEIR
GENERAL INTELLECT NOT SO CLEAR AND STRONG AS THEY FORMERLY WERE.
DR. KELLY’S BOOK WILL EXPLAIN THE CAUSE IN PLAIN AND SIMPLE LANGUAGE,
THEREFORE, EVEN THOUGH YOU BE FREE PROM DISEASE, SEND FOR THIS GREAT
MEDICAL WORK, THAT YOU MAY BE ENABLED TO ADVISE OTHERS AFTER PERUSING
ITS PAGES. VERY FREQUENTLY THIS MAY BE DONE BEFORE ANY GREAT HARM
HAS TAKEN PLACE.
SEE HIS PALE AND SALLOW FACE, UPON WHICH
DISEASE HAS LEFT ITS MARKS.
AMONG WHICH ARB

MANNER IS ECCENTRIC, LISTLESS, SHY AND EASILY CONFUSED,
HIS MOVEMENTS ARE SHUFFLING AND UNCERTAIN, AND
BETRAY A MIND ILL AT EASE, HIS MENTAL OPERATIONS ARE
ERRATIC, HE IS EMBARRASSED, AWKWARD, AND ACTS WITHOUT
ANY FIXED PURPOSE, HE IS ABSENT-MINDED, AND GIVEN TO

YOU SHOULD WRITE TO THE DOCTOR WITHOUT DELAY.

SATURDAY, NOVEMBER 21, 1891.
“ The Multitude of Counsellors.”
A few days ago a short, thick-set, white-
headed, resolute individual named Stanley
arrived in Australia, and proceeded to deliver
a series of lectures concerning how he found
Livingstone. Along with this information
he also proceeded, almost on the first day of
his sojourn in this country, to advise the
Australian people as to the best means of con-
structinga new nation, and the correctmanner
in which to run a newly-settled continent,
flis qualifications for this work consisted
chiefly in the fact that he had done much
walking and had humped much ponderous
luggage in Central Africa—that lie had set out
in the morning from a dirty village of squalid
niggers, and tramped dismally all" day
through slush and forest, and arrived in the
evening at a squalid village of dirty niggers
also, that he had shot some black men, and
flogged some more. It was because of these
things that he started to counsel a strange
people how to run their own strange world,
and by reason of the squalid niggers, and
the dirty villages, and the luggage, and the
fact that he found Livingstone, his opinions
will doubtless be received with respect.
Almost on the same day another distinguished
visitor issued his ukase, also, as to what
the Australian nation ought to do
with itself, and despite the fact that
his views were widely different from
those of the other, they, too, will
doubtless be listened to with a certain
amount of veneration. The second man’s
capacity for giving the “straight tip ’’ was
based on the fact that he was learned in the
matter of the alleys and slums of a land
16,000 miles distant—that he was well up in
dog-holes and refuse and pestilence—and that
he was a recognised authority on gaols and
workhouses ; and out of the abundance of his
knowledge on these subjects he also rose to
inform this country that he was willing to be
a father and counsellor to it, and to see it
through. Both of them started, apparently,
on the assumption that Australia knew
nothing of its own affairs, and that it badly
needed the preacher from the by-ways of
London, and the explorer from the forests
of Africa, to put it right, and keep an eye
upon things generally. As all “ distinguished
visitors ” —whether they be distinguished
soldiers or prominent aeronauts or leading
horsey men start to superintend the
government of Australia in precisely the
same way, this circumstance is by no means
surprising.
• # #
We will give the first place to the Rev.
William Booth— self-styled a “General”
to gratify his own innate craving after titles,
however shoddy—clad in glaring red, like a
long and badly-painted Mephistopheles—
autocratic, with a hawk-like eye for the cash,
and a red and varnished nose that sniffs
unceasingly after portable assets. And
this is what he says is the great present
necessity of Australia :
My opinion is that what the colonies want is a class
Similar to the agricultural class in England, men who will
be quite satisfied it they have plenty to eat and drink,
are comfortably clad, and can make some provision for
old age. That is what is wanted here. A class of
peasantry—people who, if they get a cottage and cow and
a horse, and plenty to eat and drink, will be content.
In other words, what Australia wants,
according to the views of Booth, is a class
of people without brains, or knowledge, or any
thinking capacity whatever. They must be
placid and solemn and cow-like, and have no
aspirations beyond a cottage and two animals.
And as the only possible means of prevent-
ing ambition, they must have no education,
for education leads to ambition, and the
only man who is absolutely content with
two beasts and a roof is the one who knows of
nothing beyond. The sample peasant must
have no literature beyond a Bible and a
hymn-book, and possibly some solemn publi-
cation about agriculture, and a War Cry.
He should be able to read these only with
extreme - difficulty, because if he reads
fluently he may drift into literature which
will call up visions of a wider and grander
world than that which is bounded by his
hovel and his domestic mule. He shouldn’t
vote—in fact, he should be too ignorant
to know how to vote, for a man who
can take an intelligent interest in poli-
tics is liable to grow dissatisfied, and
some day he may abandon his shanty
and his animals, and become a statesman.
He should be slow, dull, hog-like, large-
footed, stupid, and horny ; he should have
his religion supplied ready-made by the Rev.
William Booth, and he should be so heavy
and illiterate that he will do all his life
what William Booth tells him to do, and
be unable to reason for himself. He should,
in short, be simply a huge, sodden, and pig-
headed infant, and until Australia lays in a
large quantity of him things will never go
right in the Fifth Continent. This is the
advice of the Salvation autocrat, and as he
lives by bossing the mental monstrosity
which he describes, it is just the sort of
advice which might reasonably be expected
rom such a quarter.
* • #
H. M. Stanley, the homicidal explorer
from Africa, has a different inspiration, and
plans out for Australia an entirely different
future. His thoughts, naturally enough,
run chiefly upon niggers. In his view,
apparently, no country is complete without
its nigger, and the chief use and purpose of
the white man is to boss the degraded black
individual and keep him up to his work.
Therefore, where the black man is not, there
the white man is a person without a voca-
tion. He proposes, in consequence, that a
“ colour line ” should be drawn across
Australia from East to West, somewhere
above the tropic of Capricorn, and on
the Southern side of that line the
dusky heathen should be absolutely pro-
hibited. On the other side, however, he
should be grown and cultivated as a profit-
able institution, so that the white man may
use him, and make money out of him, and
have a high old time generally. Considering
how exceedingly abundant the murky
brother is in the adjacent land of Asia, it is
more than probable, under this regime, that
the coloured population of tropical Australia
would by-and-bye far exceed the white popu-
lation of the southern provinces. Then
there would grow up a race of nigger-drivers,
overseers, and gentlemen planters, who
would regard manual labour as something
beneath the dignity of the Aryan ; and along
with them would arise a degraded class of
“ mean whites”-—individuals who were
unable to find billets as nigger-drivers, and
who loafed because work was too degrading
for a white man’s dignity. Then the white
man of the North would learn to despise the
white man of the South, because the latter
did his own toil and had no nigger ; and the
man of the South would hate the one of the
North because of the undisguised contempt
with which he was regarded ; and the Aus-
tralian people would branch off into two hos-
tile races that would diverge more and more
widely as the years went on. Then, too, it
would require a whole army of soldiers or
police to guard the line of demarcation, and
keep the black population within its own
boundary, and the proceedings would end,
most probably, with a servile insurrection,
a racial war, and general chaos. All these
risks are to be run for the mere joy and
pleasure ancj privilege of having a nigger,
and the “distinguished visitor” who drew
up this scheme of elaborate foolishness did
so, apparently, merely because he had learned
to.look upon the owning of niggers as the
chief purpose of the white man’s existence.
If his life had been spent in owning a
menagerie, he would probably have been as
firmly convinced that the business of every
man’s life was to own a tiger and a big
rhinoceros, and finding that the Australian
had no tiger or rhinoceros, he would have
drawn up plans and specifications for growing
these animals with the same deadly solemnity,
and with an equally profound conviction that
no nation was complete without them.
* # «
One or two other individuals of more or
less importance have various other varieties
of advice to offer. Governor Kintore of
South Australia—celebrated chiefly as the
most reckless amateur who ever drove an
engine, and as a luxurious explorer who left
a track of champagne-bottles and corks all the
way along the made-track across this continent
—desires to devote the far North to the grmvtli
and cultivation of Chinamen. He regards
the Chow as a hardy cereal who will flourish
in all kinds of exposed situations, and he
seems to look with a pitying eye upon the
Australians as a nation that is short of
Chinamen. Also a certain Mr. Horn, of the
South Australian Legislature, wishes to plant
the coolie promiscuously all over the North,
and has introduced a motion to that effect.
All these individuals are travelling on the
one theory that this country has vast areas
of land which need to be sold without the
slightest delay, and dug up, and planted—
that it has great mineral deposits that need
to be exploited instantly—that it has pearl
fisheries which ought to be rushed imme-
diately, and forests which need to be cut
down and turned into cash in one act. And
because a local supply of white men can’t be
got fast enough, so that the heritage of the
Australian nation may be wasted and used up
right off, Kintore desires that it shall be
given away to Chinamen, and Stanley longs
to throw it to imported niggers, and Booth
wants to hand it over to a dreary and pig-
like race of clods from England, whose one
recommendation is that they are to have no
brains, no ambition, no knowledge, and none
of the attributes of man beyond a dull,
solemn, animal yearning for a roof and a
horse. They are all resolved, too, that Aus-
tralia wants much good advice and super-
vision, and each of them is willing to act as
a kind of dismal and fat-headed Uncle
Pumblechook to this orphaned land, and to
see it through generally.
* * *
The cry of the “distinguished visitor,”
and of many other visitors who are not dis-
tinguished, and of many people who are not
visitors, is that Australia wants population.
It is universally taken for granted by these
officious advisers that Australia wants pojiu-
lation so badly that if no other varieties are
to be had it would sooner have Chinamen
and niggers than go without. And the
average “ visitor ” is so hopelessly consumed
by this one theory that it seems of but little
use to tell Kintore and Booth and similar
public nuisances that Australia is not pining
after population of any sort or variety
whatever. When Kintore points out how
easily a large stock of Mongols could be
planted in the North, he strikes no more
responsive a chord than if he drew attention
to the ease with which an immense consign-
ment of boa-constrictors could be turned
loose on the same spot. When Booth states
that Australia’s one great necessity is a huge
stock of his own particular brand of soulless
British peasant, he might as reasonably and
as successfully appeal to his hearers on the
ground that they wanted a new supply of
green bugs. And when other men from
Africa or elsewhere call attention to the
urgent need of nigger-labour, they fall flat
for exactly the same reason - they might as
well call attention to the need for an imme-
diate stock of polecats. For the distin-
guished visitor always travels on the
assumption that what Australia needs is
men, while the Australian has already
decided that, except for purposes of defence,
it matters not at all whether Australia ever
possesses more men than it does at
present. The reason of this is sufficiently
simple. All over Europe and Asia, and in
some parts of the Eastern States of America,
the ceaseless cry is of the hunger and misery
and degradation produced by too much
population, but the evils born of too little
population are nowhere to be heard of. In
Australia, doubtless, the troubles that arise
from over-crowding will come in course of
time, but even if they are a wdiole billion
years ahead, that is no reason why they
should be hastened by so much as a single
day through the systematic importation of
Coolies, or Mongols, or Booth’s particular
brand of dull agriculturist. The indi-
viduals who preach the doctrine that what
Australia requires is more humanity, and
try to arouse enthusiasm thereby, might as
reasonably hold forth in a menagerie on the
subject of the lion’s great and immediate
need of buns—when they offer us men they
might as well hope to make a boom by
offering pig-iron to a cow ; the lion doesn’t
care for buns, and the cow has no craving
for pig-iron, and there the matter ends.
* * #
The oft-repeated tale about the great
resources that are lying idle for want of
hands is empty and unavailing. The
3,000,000 inhabitants of Australia are now
utilising all the resources which their num-
ber will permit ; if 3,000,000 more are
introduced they will probably utilise twice
as much soil, and grow twice as many vege-
tables, and as there will be twice as many
people to divide the proceeds, the situation
will be just the same. In any case the
resources will keep. The forests will not
bolt, nor will the soil clear out, and the
hidden gold will remain just where it is ; and
if these assets are not turned into money
this century they will be in the next, or, if
not then, they will come in useful a thousand
years hence, or if even that is too soon they
can wait ten thousand years, till the nation
is ready to employ them. And if the tropical
regions of Australia are unfit for the white
man’s occupation at the present time, it is
quite possible that some day or other in the
far-ofl future the earth will slew round on
its axis, and the Northern Territory will
rush unexpectedly into the temperate zone,
and Melbourne and Adelaide will shift down
into the land of ice and frost ; and then the
inhabitants of these cities will want the
empty regions around Port Darwin and the
Gulf as a place of refuge. Meanwhile, their
great resources are lying idle and neglected,
like the superfluous silverware on the rich
man’s sideboard, and if this fact is a reason
why the tropical provinces should be given
away to Chinamen and niggers, it is equally
a reason why Kin tore and such as he
should rush out on the instant and give their
plate to an African in order to get rid of it.
and why Booth should give his other pair of
boots—the one he isn’t wearing—to the first
mendicant he meets. This is,, no doubt,
selfish logic, but then everything on this
earth is selfish. And as there are no signs
of Kintore giving away his plate, or of
Booth handing over all his clothes savfe
those in immediate use, or of any other of
Australia’s critics bestowing all his super-
fluities on the poor, none of them have a
right to cast moral bricks on this account.
A Word to the Cabbage-Gardeners,
Nobody ever yet buried a dead superstition so
deep that it would never rise again. No one
ever yet hung a sufficiently heavy millstone to
the remains of a defunct lie, and sunk it so far
down in the sea of oblivion as to make sure that
it would never again come to the surface. In
the great economy of Nature nothing is ever
lost or destroyed—neither dust, nor worms, nor
drivel, nor brass gods, nor lies, nor continents,
nor old cranks, nor superstitions, nor any oilier
matter or substance whatever. Everything is
indestructible—it may alter its form and its
name, but the substance remains. The curse
that was uttered by some naked savage in the
year One is still floating intact somewhere in the
realms of space. The shadow of everything
that was ever done is photographed somewhere
on the atmosphere—the echo of everything that
was ever said or whispered is still existent and
in a good state of preservation. No ancient
error was ever lost or utterly extinguished ; it
may be buried to-day beneath a mountain of
convincing fact, but to-morrow it is sitting on
its old pedestal and waiting to be buried over
again. It is one long, incessant funeral, in
which the same old corpse is planted over and
over again, and as fast as it is interred it climbs
out of its sepulchre ready for another interment.
Therefore, the way of the reformer is particu-
larly hard, for when his great reformation is
finished the thing that has just been reformed
generally wants to be reformed ove” "gain
almost as badly as it did before.
# # *
The recent doings of the Victorian Legislative
Council are a striking proof of the indestructi-
bility of matter, and drivel, and superstition,
and all other tangible and intangible substances.
The subject under discussion was Premier
Munro’s One-man-one-vote Bill, and the con-
tented, old, fat men of the Upper House sat
down to consider the problem, and to decide
whether it was really true that all men were
intended to be free and equal. The question
was supposed to have been decided by divine
authority nineteen centuries ago. It had pro-
bably been settled on a dozen previous occasions
by a dozen great authorities, and every time the
world joyously accepted the doctrine of human
equality, and then went right on as before, and
worshipped the old god of Property just as if
there had been no reformation at all. A hun-
dred poets and philosophers had planked down
noble sentiments to the effect that money is in
itself an empty consideration, and that man, as
a being who ranks only a little below the
angels, is the same whether he is rich or penni-
less. From Solomon downwards the same
dogma has been repeated a thousand times, and
the ancient, bulky men of the Victorian Legisla-
ture have all a profound reverence for Solomon
and are ready to, swear by him as one unani-
mous fat Christian every time. Then they came
to exactly the same resolution that they would
have arrived at if there had been no Solomon, no
Jesus Christ, no Christianity, no reformation,
no progress—nothing. They decided that the
)■ ii who hadn't any property wasn’t worth a
( urre compared to the man who had property,
and they infixed the old plural-vote, and re-
erected the old, dead superstition that had been
buried so often, and which always came up
again as joyously as if it had never been buried
at all; and then went on their way rejoicing.
I’he old lies are imperishable. The believers
may diminish in number, but there will be
somebody left to prop up every ancient theory
to the end of time. Even Baal and Jupiter
probably have their worshippers still, if any-
body had time to hunt them up.
# # «
In re-constructing the ancient allotment-vote
the Council travelled on the same reasons which
have done duty since reasons of any kind were
first invented. The first speaker fairly repre-
sented the sentiments of all :
Mr. Dowling, a private member, moved the second
reading of the Constitution Amendment Bill. He sup-
ported the second reading so that amendments might be
made. This measure would take away privileges which
they had enjoyed for very many years.' Thrift, industry,
and temperance should be encouraged by a second vole.
This theory—which was promptly and un-
questioningly accepted—includes two assump-
tions. The first is that land or house pro-
perty—the only property which carries a double
vote —is always acquired by thrift, industry,
and temperance, and therefore by.giving an
extra vote to the landholder these desirable
traits will be encouraged in every case. The
second is that no other description of property is
ever acquired by the exercise of the three virtues
in question, and therefore no other description of
property should carry a special vote. The
landholder is to have one vote for his manhood
and another for his £4O allotment ; the house-
holder, on the other hand, will have one vote
for his manhood, but if he attempts to secure
another for his £GO piano, he will be badly left.
The allotment-vote is granted unless the
Council is guilty of hypocrisy and hard lying—
solely in recognition of the fact that allotments
are always gained by economy, hard work, and
temperance, and never by inheritance, by per-
sistent rum-selling, by illicit distillation, usury,
fraud, confidence tricks, dummyism, three-card
tricks, bookmaking, sweeps, forged title-deeds,
fan-tan, or any other baseness ; the piano-vote
is not granted, from which it may be reasonably
inferred that, in the opinion of the Victorian
Upper House, that instrument does not repre-
sent any virtue that ought to be encouraged,
and that the only way *o get a piano is by


extravagance, idleness, and persistent drunken-
ness. This is a strange and weird anomaly,
and if, as it pretends, the Council desires
to establish the plural - vote upon a really
moral basis, and to use it as a means of
promoting virtue, the advisability of granting a
separate vote for the piano should be at once
taken into consideration.
» * #
This, however, is only one side of a many-
sided problem. Clothes, like land, also repre-
sent industry and self-denial, and the necessity
for an additional vote for the well-clad elector’s
coat, hat and shirt is quite as urgent as the
necessity for a suffrage on account of some
cheap, neglected half-acre of mortgaged earth.
Under the present system, the individual who
goes in dirty rags, and puts the money
thus saved into land, is entitled to twice as
much political influence as the person who gives
up the latter indulgence, and avoids making
himself a common nuisance and an eyesore by
reason of his wearing apparel, and the injustice
cf this arrangement is sufficiently apparent.
The latter’s clothes and boots are the outward
evidences of his thrift and his temperance, and
if they are not allowed due weight at the poll,
then the whole political scheme is a lop-sided
and imbecile device, and the alleged motive
which prompted it is a lie and a base imposture.
The same rule applies to chairs, tables, carpets,
books and bric-a-brac, and it also holds good in
the matter of children. The individual in humble
circumstances whom Providence has burdened
with nine offspring is obviously entitled to a
property-vote on their account, inasmuch as,
but for them, he might reasonably have owned
sufficient property to entitle him to a vote, and
the want of that property arises from circum-
stances that are in a great measure beyond his
control. The fact that he has successfully
reared a large family is in itself an evidence of
more virility, industry, economy, and self-
denial than ten allotments with a vote attached
to each, and if the Victorian Council really
designs the plural suffrage as a recognition of
these virtues then the partial disfranchisement
of the man with a large family is ajr act of base
wickedness which cries aloud to Heaven for
redress. Further, the person whose extra vote
is founded on house-property, and who has the
misfortune to be burnt out so that his qualifica-
tion vanishes into thin air, should retain the
vote all the same ; for, according to the declara-
tion of the Victorian Upper House, his privilege
is granted, not through a mean desire to cringe
to any form of property, but as a recognition
of the virtues by which that property was
acquired. And though the property may have
vanished the virtues in question remain all the
same, and the State, by depriving the victim of
his political status under such circumstances, is
taking a base advantage of his misfortune, and
hitting an elector when he is down. Any State
that would do such a thing is too low and too
degraded for any white man to associate with.
* * *
One or two other aspects of the subject
are also worthy of attention. The neces-
sity of a vote for a life insurance policy
is too obvious to need explanation. A
life insurance policy for a good amount,
in a sound office, and regularly paid up,
represents the three • noble characteristics of
thrift, industry and temperance as effectually—
or more effectually than any allotment or
house property can do ; it also indicates fore-
sight, which is a virtue equally worthy of en-
couragement, and it is a sign of kindliness of
heart, inasmuch as the insurer evidently desires
not to leave those dependent upon him desti-
tute. The equity of granting a special vote-
under certain conditions—for broken legs, in-
flammation, domestic bereavement, and similar
afflictions is almost equally apparent. Ihe
workman who is disabled by a broken leg, and
yet gets through without outside assistance,
thereby manifests as much thrift and temper-
ance as would be evidenced by the possession of
a small patch of earth, for the patch of earth
merely proves that he had saved a certain
amount of money, and the broken leg—under
the circumstances above-mentioned —proves ex-
actly the same thing. Moreover, the damaged
limb is, in all probability, the only reason why
he doesn’t get the vote, that extremity having-
absorbed, in the shape of medical expenses, the
money which would otherwise have purchased
the necessary property. Therefore, if a soul-
less , Government refuses a property-vote to a
man with a broken leg—merely because he has
been unlucky—it thereby penalises him for
breaking his leg, which is as degrading and
unmanly as if it were to hang him for concuss-
ing his spine, or send him to penal servitude
for having rheumatism. Unless the \ ictorian
Upper House is a mere congregation of bowel-
less fat men without sympathy or human kind-
ness it will do something to remedy this awful
discrepancy right away.
* * *
The subject of plural voting, as a means of
encouraging temperance, economy, and indus-
try, is, however, an exceedingly large one, and
so far we have only touched on a few stray
illustrations of a very great matter. Fyen
granting, however, that the possession of a
certain bit of earth is, in itself, a solid evidence
of three pure and noble characteristics, and
assuming that no piece of land was ever acquired
by fraud or stealing, or by shunting an aged
parent into the workhouse, or by any other
degrading vice ; and further assuming that in-
dustry and the other two items are the only
things worth encouraging, and that charity,
chastity, piety, and matters like these are of
no account; and allowing, for the sake of argu-
ment, that the property-vote may not be quite
as often a reward for rum-selling or commercial
swindling as anything else, it is still obvious
that the Victorian Upper Chamber is only at
the beginning of its work. For it is evident to
anybody gifted with comprehension that the
three choice virtues which that body desires to
encourage cannot always break out in the shape
of land or rateable property, and by giving a
vote to land alone, and ignoring all other
evidences of genuine merit and nobility of soul,
the Council shows itself utterly indifferent to
all the claims of justice. And unless clothes
and pianos and broken legs and bedridden
relatives are similarly recognised at the polls
the plural voting scheme is, from first to last, a
degrading imposture and an outrage on every
principle of equity.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
An Incoherent Female.
The New South Wales Women’s Suffrage
League held a meeting last week, and Mrs. ,J.
B. Ashton seized the opportunity to make a
few incendiary remarks, in the course of which
she wandered far from the point, greatly dam-
aged the cause of womanhood suffrage with a
large section of the population, and made the
back-hair and the fringe of the League stand up
on end. The following is a summary of the
observations in question : —■
The simple words “ womanhood suffrage ” only fixed in
her mind more strongly two convictions that had boen
fairly well established there—(list, that abnormal intel-
lectual triumphs could never fully satisfy the feminine
nature ; and, second, that the suffrage once fairly attained
for women, their first work must be to amend the mar-
riage laws, or, blasphemous as the words might sound, do
away with them altogether. Marriage, as a solution of
the great sexual problem of to-day, was a failure—a
lamentable one—and to them, the small thinking section
in a world of marionettes, was given the righting
of a wrong that had endured for centuries. They
had grown to regard the marriage ceremony as
a Christian ordinance. It was purely a social cus-
tom. What was moral in one country’ stood for
nothing in another. Year after year sweet girls were
brought forward in the marriage market; year after year
the purest and best of them shrank back from the un-
equal contest between innocence and worldliness, ideality
and stern reality. No woman until she had known love
and achieved the dignity of motherhood was thoroughly
complete, and yet to oue-half the world of women, this
simple fulfilment of a natural destiny was denied. To
right this wrong, to set these matters upon a sound basis,
rested with the men and women of the future, when they
should have wrested from a conservative society the simple
privilege of working for the common good. And other
social problems, which women alone could help to solve,
awaited her aid and sympathy in the coming years.
It is the same old weary wail of the advanced
female over and over again. Marriage is a
failure— The Bulletin admits the fact freely.
But, then, nearly everything else that we know
of is a failure, too. Free-love is a failure ;
polygamy is a ghastly delusion; celibacy is a
fraud; and marriage, so far, is the smallest
failure of the lot—barring divorce. There
is one incurably weak point about the
advanced female ; she always wants to
abolish marriage, but she seldom has
the courage to definitely recommend any-
thing as a substitute. If free-love is to be
the substitute, then the average male will throw
out his partner by superior brute force as soon
as she becomes old and ugly, and leave her to
maintain the family, and the navigation of our
harbours and rivers will be hampered by the
remains of lost, deserted women who have
been ejected in their old age. Then, there is
further trouble, because women are too plenti-
ful, and a large proportion of the species are
unable to get married at all, and the “ dignity
of motherhood ” is denied them. This difficulty
may possibly be got over by polygamy, hut
then polygamy has been tried, and, so far, it
doesn’t amount to much ; or, again, it may be
surmounted by killing off all superfluous females
in infancy—only Mrs. Ashton doesn’t openly
recommend either alternative. Something
might be done by the establishment of
a. Socialistic system, so that all abandoned
children might be cared for by a State
department, and as all -property would belong
to the State, there would always be sufficient
funds on hand to meet this tremendous
liability, and then families could break up at
any hour of the day or night without hindrance;
but, again, Mrs. Ashton doesn’t seem to
say anything about Socialism. Another and
a shorter way would be to establish universal
celibacy, and let the human race, with all its
troubles and worries and problems, die out
altogether, but, if the modern advanced female
wants to die out, she never says so. She wants
to put things on a “ sound basis,” but she
never by any chance produces the basis.
Marriage, alleviated by divorce, has one recom-
mendation —it furnishes at least a partial
solution of the great difficulty about the
maintenance of the rising generation, ; ml fixes
the responsibility —to a certain extent at least-
on somebody. It does it badly, but then every
other scheme yet propounded seems to do it a
deal worse. It is a failure, but it is no good
exchanging it for a worse failure, and there is
nothing to be gained by abolishing it for the
sake of any incoherent female, unless she has
something to suggest that can take its place.
And, so far, no incoherent female that we know
of has suggested anything.
Prison Labour.
What to do with the imprisoned criminal is
one of the unsolved problems of civilisation.
The average criminal, in a very large propor-
tion of cases, is an individual who has no useful
calling—who knows no trade, and has no avail-
able means of livelihood. If he belongs to what
is commonly described as the “ lower ranks of
society he is a howling rowdy who appears in
the charge-sheet as a “labourer’ —in other
words, he is an individual who has no occupa-
tion, except—like the horse and the working
bullock —that of a common and precarious beast
of burden. If he is a little better dressed, and
has a little more knowledge of geography and
dead kings and similar subjects, he becomes a
money-lender’s jackal, or a iinance and com-
mission swindler, or an alleged broker with an
alleged office in a back street , or a hanger-on of
bogus companies ; and when lie gets into gaol for
some shady transaction concerning a bank, he
is probably entered as an “ agent ” —which also
means, in most cases, that he has no useful
occupation whatever. If he is simply shoved
into a whitewashed room, like a quantity of
coal in a cellar, or a wild animal in a zoological
garden, he is a useless expense to the com-
munity ; and when he comes out he must either
take to fraud or to plain, unvarnished burglary
as before. He never learned anything else, and
fraud or burglary, as the case may be, is the
only occupation he has to live upon. On the
other hand, if he is compelled to learn a trade,
and the products of his industry are sold in the
open market, he becomes a self-supporting in-
stitution during his term of imprisonment, and
when he is released the chances of his relapsing
into crime are diminished —in the case ot the
high-toned swindler very slightly, in that
of the common or garden malefactor —as has
been proved by actual experiment —at least
95 per cent. Man is a creature of habit.
The loafer who has led a precarious existence
by robbery with violence may be put through a,
course of seven years’ hard cabinet-making, and
when he is released the saw and the chisel have
become matters of custom ; he may have gone
through no process of repentance or moral
regeneration, yet he continues to live by
cabinet-making from sheer force of habit. But
if he is simply locked up in a cell, and haunted
by a parson, the cell and the parson also become
matters of habit, oidy as they do not constitute
a useful occupation he obviously cannot live by
them, and therefore his prison training is of no
use to him. Unluckily, however, that obtuse,
ynreasoning tiling known as constituted au-
thority always takes it for granted that
prison labour and cheap labour ought to
be synonymous terms. The prison labourer
becomes a species of confined blackleg, and
his work tends to reduce prices outside.
Sundry favoured firms which have gained
access to the capacious ear of those in power
buy up the products of gaol industry for a
song, and fetch it away surreptitiously by
night, and thus are enabled —while realising
large profits—to sell it at prices which are
absolutely ruinous for the workman who is not
blessed with free board and lodging in a peni-
tentiary. Then there arises an outburst of
frenzy against prison labour of all kinds, and a
demand is made that it should be entirely
abolished—that the criminal should be a dead
loss to the country during his term of confine-
ment, and should be turned loose the same
helpless and incapable individual that he was
at the beginning. This theory is entirely
unreasonable. It is a democratic maxim
that every man should work for his living
—if not voluntarily, then by compulsion.
It is also a Christian maxim that the sinner
should be reformed if possible, and the shortest
road to reformation is by placing him in a
position which makes honesty possible. Fur-
ther, it is better and cheaper that the garrotting
man or the burglar should be violently trans-
formed into a good tradesman, even if he
thereby increases the pressure of competition
upon other tradesmen, than that he should
come out to choke these same tradesmen on the
highway, and clean out their pockets as before.
The one evil lies in turning the criminal into a
cheap-labour machine. Every gaol ought to be
a huge workshop, run on pure business prin-
ciples. The products should be sold in the
large centres of population by auction, or
privately at ordinary trade rates. Then the
additional competition would be practically
unfelt, for the criminal population is not large
enough to seriously affect the labour market,
provided it works at the regular trade rates.
But so long as it is utilised on cheap Chinese
principles, a few hundred prisoners are suffi-
cient to depress the rate of wages throughout
a whole country.
The ancient bigots of Auckland (M.L.) have
founded yet another National Association. It
is built on the same plan as the Associations at
Sydney, Melbourne, and Brisbane; like them,
it is composed entirely of landlords, bankers,
merchants, brokers, squatters, commission-
agents, steamship-owners, and the like ; and it
lias the same hypocritical programme setting
forth that it wants to secure the due represen-
tation of all classes of society, and to prop up
the constitution, and look after the best interests
of everybody. Its first public act has been to
prepare a petition to Governor Onslow, de-
manding that he should make no further
appointments to the Legislative Council, and
as a scheme for recuring the duo repre-
sentation of all classes, and propping up the
Constitution, this is a really good beginning.
For during the last two years or more the
Maoriland Lower House has passed about eight
democratic measures, every one of which the
Council has either rejected, or else mutilated
so as to render it utterly abortive; therefore,
as the Lower House is distinctly representa-
tive of the people, and the non-representative
Chamber blocks every attempt it makes to
carry out the popular will, and as the Association
insists that no steps shall be taken to abolish
this deadlock, it follows that the Association
demands in effect that representative Govern-
ment shall be abolished. As matters stand at pre-
sent, the irresponsible nominees ask that things
should remain as they are, while the people’s
delegates want them to keep progressing, and
as the stagnant House has had its way for up-
wards of two years, the system of representative
government has practically been non-existent
for that period. This ancient stone-wall can
only be broken up by filling the Council with
fresh nominees, and the urgent request of the
alleged “ National ” party that no such move-
ment shall be permitted is a lurid commentary
upon its so-called principles. Moreover, there
is another aspect of the case which is equally
surprising. Governor Onslow is supposed
to act in all things by the advice of
his Ministers. The Ballance Cabinet—
which, by reason of its democratic ten-
dencies, is utterly loathed by the ancient Tory
party—undoubtedly contemplates a
batch of democrats to the Upper House, as
the only means of breaking up the existing
deadlock. Therefore, the Association requests
in the strongest and most direct language that
Onslow shall burst up the Constitution by
acting directly counter to his advisers in a
matter which belongs exclusively to their
.province. And yet it asserts that its object is
above all things to preserve the Constitution,
and keep it intact. In other words, it wants
to break the thing, and then preserve it after
it is broken.
Sydney D.T.’ again touts undisguisedly for
the creation of local electric-lighting mono-
polies. Some of its arguments are curiously
wide of the subject of attack, which is in
reality the City Council’s proposal to undertake
the work municipally; others are simply
inverted in the interest of dividend-pay-
ing concerns which live on the entrails
of populous communities. Briefly, the D.T.
argues that, because the Sydney Council’s
present scheme of electric-lighting is ” tardily
conceived and miserably inefficient,” therefore,
it should not be permitted to carry out any
scheme no matter how ably conceived or practi-
cally efficient it may be. Because the Council
proposes to experiment with the high-tension arc
system, which is, rightly or wrongly, saidby some
(interested but possibly truthful) experts to be
dangerous, therefore, it is to be debarred alto-
gether from undertaking any other system of
electric-lighting. TheD.T. declares the Council
to be per.se incapable of dealing with the subject.
Why a corporate body of men not interested in
paying themselves dividends should be incap-
able while dividend makers are capable, is not
stated. It is to be presumed that the Council,
which will not need to run a city-lighting
project as a money - piling concern, will
be able to pay a competent electrical
staff as good salaries as a private syndi-
cate that demands profits of from 10 per
cent, upwards to —the limit of public forbear-
ance. The D.T. also girds at the idea that the
Council, after street-lighting, should seek to
make money out of private companies by
issuing leases conferring on them the right to
illuminate private establishments. To ordinary
intelligences, it would seem more sensible for
the Council — i.e., the ratepayers—-to make
money out ,of syndicates than to empower
syndicates to make money out of the ratepayers.
But the D.T. is aghast at the bare thought of
the money of the ratepayers being “ expended
in works which private enterprise could carry
out as well or better.” Pish ! If the project
is good enough for private enterprise, it must,
by the nature of the conditions, be better still for
the combined enterprise of the ratepayers. The
alarm sought to 100 created, concerning the
“perils” to which “the City Corporation, in
their new zeal as amateur electricians, propose
subjecting the citizens of Sydney,” may be
laughed to death. In all measures of this kind,
Parliament can adopt a clear course in the
public interest—(l) grant no special privileges
to any private syndicate so long as a local cor-
poration is willing to undertake the task ; (2)
insist upon provisions ensuring public safety in
any Bill, whether that Bill relates to a syndi-
cate or to a municipal corporation. The public
squelched the tram way-grab (inaugurated by one
or more of the D.T. directors); let it now squelch
the electric-lighting grab now in course of in-
cubation.

Matthias Larkin, a gentleman “prominent
in religious circles in South Melbourne,” and a
godly auctioneer in a large way of business, was
last week compelled by force of circumstances
to admit that he had plundered a building-
society of some ten or fifteen thousand pounds.
Matthias was secretary to several highly re-
spectable institutions, the building society
amongst them, and this being the concern that
offered the most opportunities for a wholesale
loot, he had “played up” the savings of his
keeind friends and brethren until his brain be-
came unequal to any further manipulation of
the books, whereupon he bowed'his head in
shame and hoped the Lord would forgive him.
Living in a well-feathered nest, and with his
bank-balance increasing every day, Matthias
wasn’t satisfied. The average poor clerk,
who tries to make enough money to fur-
nish a four-roomed cottage by backing
horses, and drops his master’s petty cash
over the wrong Malvolio, would, in five
cases out of six, have been a good, upright
fellow for life if someone had given him £2OO
to get married on. Avery small amount of
capital would suffice to make most first offenders
as honest as the Judge who gives them six
months, and the shopman, with a wife and
family, who pilfers to make both ends meet on
355. a week is almost invariably brought back
to the path of rectitude by a “ rise ” of ten
shillings. There was no sort of excuse for
Matthias to steal. In the days of his pros-
perity he hankered after fabulous wealth, and
though he used to wag his head and sigli
sympathetically over sermons on humility, or
discourses on the vanity of piling up riches
in this world, he was all the while
concocting schemes for buying land to
an amount far beyond his ample means.
And when the land-boom burst this representa-
tive pietist hadn’t sufficient manhood to go
bung. He embezzled and went on praying
more vigorously than ever. Such is the in-
fluence of “ position,” however, on the grovelling
soul of a daily newspaper that the Age was
unable to conceive the possibility of Matthias
Larkin getting his deserts like the vulgar
species of malefactor. In an apologetic tone
that alleged organ of the masses referred to the
shortcomings in Larkin’s cash, and added,
“ the idea appears to be held that gentlemen
who entertained a sincere regard for Mr.
Larkin would not now leave him entirely to his
own devices and would manifest the feeling by
making up the amount of his discrepancies. ’
Which is a distinct suggestion that the big
embezzler deserves to be saved from gaol or
have his sentence reduced 90 per cent, by in-
fluential friends, notwithstanding, that a poor
devil who prigs a pound of butter can’t get his
felony compounded so long as poverty remains
the worst of all crimes in the social calendar.
A broken-down wretch named Fownes
died the other day in New York. A few years
ago he was a doctor with a fashionable practice
and a pile of money, but in an evil hour he
became a slave to cotfee, and went to the bad. He
spent a large fortune in constructing new coffee-
pots and improved coffee-roasters; and his practice
broke up, because he left his patients to die while
he was grinding coffee-beans on some entirely
fresh principle, or fooling with some device to
bring out the aroma. Then he got into debt, and
his furniture was seized, and he was ejected from
his mansion ; and at last he became a poor, miser-
able, shattered coffee-fiend, and died in a cellar,
prematurely old, and quite alone. His only assets
were the clothes he wore and 24 coffee-pots. Any
young man who rashly contemplates abandoning
whisky and taking to the flowery paths of the old,
saddle-coloured beverage, should be warned by his
awful fate, for the coffee-bean goeth before a fall,
and he who warmeth the coffee-pot in his bosom
shall be stung thereby. Also the chicory herb is a
mocker which rushes down a steep place into the
sea; and the tea-plant goeth about like a roaring
shrub seeking whom it may devour; and the
cocoa-tree cometh like a thief in the night, any
raiseth Cain generally.

816 Macquarie-slreet North, Sydney, Nov. 18,1891".
My Dear Moorabinba, —
Sydney Women Suffragists are publishing loud, in-
dignant cries in the daily press at the advocacy of
hymeneal Freetrade put forth at a recent hen-convention
by a married member, who stood up and railed at the holy
state of matrimony saying (a la Mona Caird) that the
league “should amend the marriage laws or doaway with
them altogether.” Which was the signal to fall to.
There isn’t enough matrimony to go round, according to
the advanced lady in question, and lots of women shed
tears over their “incompleteness’’and unutterable failure
because they have never been called upon to minister to
the whims of a lord and master. Now, so far as 1 can
ascertain, this yearning after matrimony, pur et simple ,
isn’t so very general, after all. Every girl dreams of a
rich husband, but very few envy the hum-drum connubial
joys of the worn-visaged matron acting as general
servant, nurse, companion, and valet to a man whose
commercial value is attested by the smallness of his
salary. Tor it is a utilitarian age ; love in a bark-hut is
scratched in the field of starters for the Hymeneal Plate,
and many a woman writes “Miss” on her visiting-cards
because Gussie laid a wealth of undying worship but
only four pounds a week at her feet. There is altogether
too much sympathy 7 wasted on the unmarried woman.
She is generally a cold, callous, speculative darling who
doesn’t melt into the first arms that open to receive her,
and who dies under a willow, simply because the only man
she e\ er lo\ ed had small wages, and her price was four
figures.
Buccaneer Stanley, now being towed round by the only
Smythe, had a decent reception on his first appearance
in Australia, at Melbourne Opera House on 11th inst.
There was a crowded house, headed by Gov. Hopetoun,
accompanied by Hon. Violet Willoughby in a silver-grey
gow n with a big crimson rose in the front. I went to
reverence and remained to quiz. The hero of the hour
turned out to be a medium-sized, grey-headed brigand in
a dress-suit that didn't fit him, especially in the bagleto,
and who talked English rather stiffly—like a man whose
tongue has been somewhat cricked by words like “mat-
■ okotloto” and other double-jointed African remarks,
md who rubbed his hands like a shop-walker as he talked
in a worn-out, deprecatory sort of voice through a lecture
.“How I Found Livingstone”) which would go better, to
my way of thinking, were a little more naked savage and
war-whoop thrown in, and a lot of bathos, and_Bib!e, and
British cant left out. Mr. S. produced a rather bad im-
pression when, in reply to a scratch-back address from
the Victorian Geographical Society, who begged to be
allowed to call him a member, he arose and ungracefully
said; “that though he had been elected member of all
the leading European geographical societies, he would
have much pleasure,” &c. And yet the V.G.S. cheered
him.
The attention of the house was drawn just as much to
the box where Mrs. Stanley and her mother sat, as it was
to the little man in front of the large map on the stage.
Mrs. S. is a straight-featured lady, who wears her dark
hair in sausage-rolls down the back of her head, and has
an English cheek as red as a rose. She wore a white
gown on her Australian debut, and all through the talkee-
talkee (she must know it all off backways and sideways
by now) kept her opera-glasses fixed on hubby, who sent
her a little, imploring glance now and then. Mr. S.’s
mother-in-law is a “Nita Juanita’’-looking personage,
with raven hair, who wore a cream lace scarf a la Spanish
mantilla, and appeared to doze gently most of the time.
At the end of the lecture, Mr. S. and party were intro-
duced to the Governor, who remained seated in his box
while Master Wallington, in scarlet facings, went behind
and rounded the explorer up.
Cardinal Moran’s strictures on the “ Protestant nuns ”
to be established in Australia by the Anglican churches
are very true, after all. Protestant nuns nearly all slide
over to the Pope, or bolt back to the world, the flesh, and
the Bogie Man. “The religious life,” said the Cardinal,
“must be real to be sustained. There were two kinds of
soldiers—the real and the theatrical,” &c. quite so, your
reverence. Protestant “sisters” are never very real.
They can marry if they get the chance, and, this being
so, there will always be the greatest number of nuns
around the celibate incumbent and the curate with the
high forehead, and when a whole sisterhood admires one
inoffensive sky-pilot it isn’t likely that there will be any-
thing but jealousy and wool-work shoes come out of that
nunnery. By the way, Protestant nuns are an old story
at that ritualistic fane, St. David’s, Hobart. There they
wear long black robes and are usually discovered dusting
the ornaments on the altar when the devout drop in for
afternoon prayer. They aren’t very communicative to
the enquiring stranger, but they give a dim, religious
aspect to the premises generally, and three of them flut-
tering in a dark corner make the worlding’s flesh creep in
a manner that is probably good for his soul.
The latest Sydney divorce was brought about in rather
an unusual manner. Instead of the guilty wife falling
stiffly on to her deceived husband’s collar and weeping
her comforting statements all down the back of his neck
10, and behold, the gay Lothario dropped in casually one
evening, and knelt at the feet of the plaintiff, and gave
himself and the lady away with a minuteness of detail
that made hubby reach for his horse-whip. But Lothario
so wept and implored his enraged victim not to “put a
head on him,” summarily, that the latter thought better
of it, and is going to take it out in damages. But what a
foolish effect—Petrarch conscience-stricken at the feet of
“Mr, Laura!”
A well-known Melbourne sporting man wore a woman’s
gold cable bangle on Cup-day—obviously the property of
some fair syren who was indifferent to the state her
jewellery was kept in, for it had the appearance of a
bracelet accustomed to a hard life—the banged-about ex-
pression of a wristlet which is pulled over a semi-soiled
kid glove one moment and dropped among beer-dregs and
cigar-ash the next, and it somehow seemed to represent the
gentleman who had borrowed it for a Mascotte in a shift-
ing light. You could almost see the lady handing it ever
to him in curl papers and pink dressing-gown.
The engagements are announced of Miss Cissie Lake, of
“ Barossa,” Balaclava (Vic.), to Mr. Geo. Webb, artist, of
Melbourne. Miss Martin, eldest daughter of Lady Martin,
Woollahra House, Rose Ray, Sydney, to Mr. Allardyce, of
riji—the engagement to be crowned by an English
wedding ; Miss Broomfield, youngest daughter of Captain
Broomfield, of Balmain, is to marry Mr. Percy Bundle in
Hecember. Another December wedding is that of Mr.
Harold Lilley, son of Chief Justice Lilley, and Miss Finney,
both well-known Brisbaneites.
r Bold Jersey will take part in the cricket-match—
Zingari versus the Fleet—to happen on the llushcutters’
Bay Oval, now in splendid order, on 26th inst.
The wedding of Miss Ada Mason (for ten years governess
to Lady Jersey’s children) to Professor Allen, of the Mel-
bourne University, took place at the Anglican Church,
Sutton forest, on tlth inst. Lord Jersey gave the bride
away, and the Jersey children acted as bridesmaids and
page—the girls wearing pale-blue silk frocks and posies
of yellow roses, presented by the bridegroom. The bride
woie white silk trimmed with chiffon and lilies of the
' ft hey, and wore a diamond brooch (Lord Jersey’s gift)
and a diamond bracelet from the bridegroom. At break-
fast, laid on the verandah, Lady Jersey proposed the
health of the bride and bridegroom, who commenced their
honey moon at Bowral. Lord and Lady Jersey presented
the bride with a diamond brooch, a diamond and pearl
biooch, an inlaid cabinet, and a cheque.
Lots of girls involve themselves in that boisterous after-
dance, “Kitchen Lancers,” with a certain amount of feat
and trembling, for great are all the croppers therein if
you lose grip and get giddy, and there is a possibility of a
short, sharp snapping of brittle bones. During Cup week
the Block was paraded by a pretty blonde with her arm
in a sling who knows all about it. “ I was darncing the
kitchen larncers, you know.”
An American poetess says that all bachelors over 40
should be taxed according to the number of single women
o' el ' the proceeds to be used for the support of maiden
ladies. But this would be simply jumping on their own
orange-blossom, as it were, if the single women t°ok it
up. No woman would advertise herself as an advanced
' irgin to get some of the bachelor’s cash by means of a
hag-tax. No, she would rather put more cotton-wool in
her jersey and a youthful touch of perexide on her scanty
back hair, call herself 28 to the census-fiend, and trust to
Cupid to pull her through.
Advt. from Sydney D.T.
(SUPERIOR LADY, musical, good manager, could
take charge of house for lady desiring a change,
salary not so much an object; has one chi d fouryears
old, well recommended by people in position. Gov.
Institute, 108 Bathurst-st.
The superior musical housekeeper usually has an olive
twig or two in her wake, but she rarely dares to hint that
“people in position’’know anything about the infant. It
must be rather embarrassing to be a lady housekeeper’s
progeny, highly recommended by the fat deacon who used
to attend the same church as “ mamma!”
The P. of W. and his charmingly frescoed help-mate
must present rather a dazzling appearance, unless you go
prepared to adore them through a piece of burnt glass ;
not even the most fashionable couple at Flemington on
Derby day looked a quarter as brilliant as Albert E. and
his consort are said to have looked at Cowes on a recent
occasion. She wore a costume of white serge braided in
white, the long pea-jacket lined with scarlet silk, a white
yachting cap and yellow boots, and H.R.H. himself was
gorgeous in a chocolate brown suit, tan shoes, and a pink
shirt, cuffs and collar! He also probably' ran to a crimson
pocket-handkerchief, and a primrose boutonniere mea-
suring twelve inches across, and when the breeze agitated
the atmosphere, it’s ten to one that the Royal chromo-
trope exhibited a pair of red-silk socks.
I had a chat with a Melbourne lady-doctor the other
day—don’t you want to hear all about it ? You could
trace the woman even in the waiting-room, with its little
gipsy tables and their fancy-work covers—a piano in one
corner, with a text above it, “He that believeth in me
hath everlasting life’’—put up, perhaps, as a delicate
insinuation as to the powers of the doctress. I went
early, but the throng of afflicted was so large that I
endured a dreary wait ere I could be given ten minutes
tite a tete—so you see that woman-doctors are not going
to starve yet awhile. I found my quarry seated in a
surgery, got up like a boudoir with fans and fancy-work—
as different as possible from the depressing leather fur-
niture and calf-bound books of the average medical man’s
lair. She was a tall, good-looking woman, with dark hair
and piercing grey eyes, with a masculine strength of
expression in them, and she was neatly gowned in dark-
blue braided serge. Eighteen months’ practice in Mel-
bourne has been rewarded by flocks of patients, mostly
women, altho’ several men (most of ’em parsons) have
come to have their pulses felt by her slim, white fingers.
She has been invited to consult with leading medical men
who have given her every encouragement. One brought
his daughter to her for treatment; could confidence
farther go? and, in short, she finds the practice of her
profession a pecuniary success.
A certain musical lady, whenever she gets an engage-
ment among new people, always attends with herpockets
bulging with photographs of “dear English scenes—the
home of my youth,” &c. But, as ill-luck would have it,
she showed her bale of relics to a snag fresh from ’Ome
the other day. When she proudly produced a full-sized
cabinet of an important-looking building which she was
about to proclaim as her childhood’s happy home, the im-
portation blurted out “ Why, that’s the northern aspect
of Wycombe Abbey—your Lord C’arington’s place, don’t
you know !” Those photographs have had a rest ever
since.
Yours affectionately,
SAPPHO SMITH.
Taranganba again !
It is most convenient to have a first-class
room near tram stopping places, where ladies
can rest themselves, and if they choose, have a
good cup of tea, or other refreshments. We
understand the Country Milk Go’s. “Cascade”
80 & 82 Elizabeth-street, near King-street, is just
the place; it is certainly the largest and best
conducted room in Sydney, and is getting quite
the fashionable resort for afternoon tea. We also
understand that ladies who so desire can have
parcels sent there so that they can call for them
just before taking the tram for home.*

He was a brave young- polo knight,
And close to saddle stuck,
What time the steed jumped left and right
And eke would try to buck ; -
But when the rearing nag became
The stock of startled wonder,
He stood his feet on either side,
And the pony walked from under.

frenzy, love, meanness, jealousy, and a lot more. As for

S.M. Herald, 10th Nov. :
The fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the Prince of
Wales was celebrated, as it usually is in New South
Wales, with the utmost enthusiasm.
That scribe hasn’t recovered from the last cele-
bration of the fiftieth anniversary.
Maurice Dalton, aged 73 years, was hanged
at Darlinghurst prison on Tuesday morning for
the murder of his wife who had, from the evidence
given at the trial, “ nagged ” him into frenzy. Of
course nagging is no valid excuse for murder, but
under the circumstances, it might have been
thought that the State could easily have afforded
to let a miserable old wretch live out the remainder
of his days in gaol—that it could without any
mock sentiment or bogus respect for grey haired
savagery have extended to the septuagenarian
homicide the consideration which certain tribes
of Queensland niggers extend to white horses—
“ Ole fellow yarraman.” But the Dibbs Govern-
ment isn’t built that way. It believes in the
gallows, alike for boys of 17, and men of 77. As
a consequence (we quote from the Australian
Star, the Dibbs Government’s special organ):—
The spectacle was a horrible one as Dalton’s lifeless
body turned slowly, and the blood poured from the
gaping wound in the throat and ran in a bright red
stream, warm and rich with life, down his legs and rippled
into the pit below.
You can always bet that anything to which the
Sydney evening papers de'vote three columns
apiece, has a strongly civilising tendency.
Snatched from the grave. Mrs. M.
O'Connell writes from Windsor, Oct. 3, 1801:
‘‘ For many years I have been a victim to palpita-
tion of the heart and extreme nervousness, and
was induced by a friend to try Marshalls’ Tonic
Nervine, when to my joyful surprise a complete
change took place. I became once more sound
and well, my whole system becoming renovated,
and appetite and digestion good, therefore I can-
not help adding my testimony to the wonderful
qualities of your wonderful medicine. I know it
matched me from the grave.”
Champions in arena fistic,
Crowned in circles gladiatorial,

Curiosity to see a man so notorious as
11. M. Stanley, combined with the sanguine hope
that he would prove an entertaining narrator of
his doubtful doings on the Dark Continent
attracted four large, serious-looking audiences to
Melbourne Opera House last week. A few of the
people present on each of these sorrowful occa-
sions were sincere believers in Stanley and his
great work. ’ Others had come prepared to be
persuaded that he was something better than a
mere filibuster, while to the great majority he was
little more than a name that had been cropping
up in newspapers, cablegram, and paragraphs
for a long series of years. The one established
tact about Stanley was that he had “found
Livingstone,” the further fact, that his so-called
discovery was a small achievement compared with
Livingstone’s quiet way of getting there in the
hrst instance, not being generally known. It was
sufficient that one of the Best advertised men in the
world had undertaken to walk upon the stage and
deliver a lecture upon himself. Whether Stanley’s
admirers got their money’s worth out of the hero
is less certain than that the people who went to
be persuaded came away as wise as when thev
entered the theatre. Concerning Stanley’s pre-
tentions to entertain the general public with a
description (apocryphal or otherwise) of his
d lu nt;U u es ™ ere can scarcely be two oninions, or
it there be, the second opinion is confined to the
writers of notices for daily newspapers. A publi-
cation like the Age may choose to represent the
ex-agent for the New York Heealu as a first-
class lecturer a man who has an absorbingly in-
teresting story to tell, and tells it with impressive
effect. Unprofessional critics and unprejudiced
listeners, however, will find Stanley the dreariest
or bores, reading, in measured, monotonouspulpifc
tones, a sermon that contains little to fix one’s
attention and much that explains why sassiety
after a few dinner-party experiences of the
explorer, ceased to lionise him. One of his dis-
courses deals mainly with latitudes, longitudes
square miles, and the number of cubic feet of
water discharged into the sea by the Congo, which
is a broad-fast flow-ing-river-of-a-rich-brown
co-lour. rhe awful absence of “ go,” humour, or
anything like real pathos in Stanley’s lectures
(which are mercifully brief) is as noticeable as the
obtrusive pains he takes to adopt a subdued man-
ner of sounding his own trumpet. His references
to royalty, as when he solemnly descants upon the
noble munificence of King Leopold,” betray the
size of his sun-dried soul, and his self-congratula-
tion over the work accomplished in the Congo
region, where 3672 police and 37 military
stations (with power to add to their number) are
the outcome of Stanley’s visits, and the result of
his purchasing a large chunk of continent for two
pans of stockings and a bootjack stamp him as a
born missionary of the deepest dye.

Hie present stage appearance of this un-
questionably fearless and tough adventurer is a
severe disillusion. In evening-dress the little
hero seems almost podgy, probably owing to the
amount of flannel swathings he must necessarily
wear for protection against “jungle cramps,”and
Ins tat face expresses nothing in particular. But
for the white curly hair on his large bullet head
it would be difficult to recognise, from his por-
traits the man who “rescued ” Emin Pasha from
the danger that he immediately returned into,
and who now gives himself clean away by his
laboured attempts to belittle Emin and cover up
the gory scandals for which the last Stanley ex-
pedition is well, celebrated. Pictorially, the
lecturer is as disappointing as his lectures. He
ought to come on in a Darkest Africa get-up.

ballet, and if he could manage to throw

of Waterloo by way of a peroration, his

due at Melbourne again—in the Town Hall. The
wily Smythe has this distinguished missionary at
the end of his little string.

Poor old “ Rob Roy,” a drama which was
unfortunately born before comic operas were in-
vented, enjoyed a gloomy resurrection at Mel-
bourne Royal on Saturday. The Braw Scots
rolled up in force to the spectacle and bore with
it patiently enough, but thev neglected to demon-
strate over passages intended to be stirring, and
displayed no national indignation when some
Sassenach infidels in the gallery began to poke
borak at Macgregor’s outlaw followers. De-
scribed on the playbill as “Sir Walter Scott’s
immortal work,” this stage-version of “Rob Roy”
consists of selections from Scott, interspersed
with silly fustian speeches and musical items.
Good singing and a lavish display of sturdy
supers might, even in this irreverent age, carry
the antiquated production to a successful issue,
but, as matters were on Saturday, there seems
little hope for the Highland chieftain. Walter
Bentley’s powers as an actor are not to be fairly
judged by his first satisfactory appearance in a kilt

There are some very flue airs in “The
Corsair,” particularly in the Byronical privateer’s
chestnut wig donned for the occasion by Fanny
Liddiard. Anyhow, the music, particularly com-
poser Rice’s very own, is lively, and his musical
curry is served up at Sydney Royal after the
manner of “Evangeline,” with much gorgeous
drapery, scenic effect, and spectacular display.
Its legs are as limber and its silks as sheeny as
the veriest voluptuary could desire, and themany-
ourtair.e 1 harem, the lugger, winged “ with
scented sails of silver silk, whereon the great, red
gladioli burn,” are gaudy as the visions of a Per-
sian poet after a jamboree on sherbet cooled with
snowballs. The music here and there is a little
out of Fanny Liddiard’s reach, but she reaches it
somehow without straining her tendon Achilles,
and looks as plump and tight-fitting as though
slic’d never known the influenza. “ The Spanish
Duet,” sung by Conrad and ids captive, Medora,
played by Virginia Earl, is one of the best
vocal items in the show, but the singing of the
“elite quartette,” Messrs. Edwards, Fitzgerald,
Ure and Brown, hit our tympanum most agreeably.
The gasconading, gore-quaffing Birbanto is
played by George Walton. George’s singing is
not calculated to gain him a golden harp and
halo, but, even with Storey’s stepping in
mind, his,dancing is a fling of beauty and a jig
forever. Fat Fortesene’s humour is to be guaged
chiefly by dropping a penny in the slot, and the
spectacle of a twenty-stunner in ballet skirts is
not a thing of kaleidoscopic variety. The rest of
the fun is contributed by Harry Leston, as
Yussuf, a green-kilted Irish dealer in femininity,
who dances well and sings decently. Large house
on first night ; business, so far, fair.

“Eolith,” revived at Sydney Her Majesty's,
is as good a thing as George Rignold has ever
done in the melo-dramatio line. This light of
other days seems likely to revive the lately-
tarnished glories of the Pitt-street theatre.
Having reduced his weight by aid of the influenza,
Rignold is now sufficiently attenuated to look
somewhat like Frank Darlington, but his perform-
ance is scarcely up to the standard of that he
showed us some ten years ago. It’s a pity the
prevailing epidemic wasn’t also laid on to the long
waits of first night, for the show nearly over-
lapped the rim of Sunday morning. William
Rignold, who plays the vicar, looks much
like an enlarged Bishop Barry, and other-
wise fills the clerical gaiters admirably.
Harry Jewett does his best to make the villain
unconventional and original. Larry is right into
the hands of Sweeney, and Jem Hazlitt, Joe
Tolano, and Stirling Whyte, are good as gold in
small parts. The histrionic event of the show,
however-, is the Sydney debut of Rose Conroy, a
young lady who dropped on these shores without
any flourish of trumpets, and who has previously
appeared at Melbourne Princess. As Eve de
Malvoisie the stranger is bright and picturesque;
apparently a finished actress, she is likely to
become a favourite. In the unavoidable absence
of Mrs. Rignold, Roland Watts-Phillips plays
Willie Spratley very well indeed, but we much
prefer the lady in skirts. Kate Bishop is well
placed as Mrs, Walsingham. If “ Youth ” doesn’t
prove a big go it will be only because there is no
money left in Sydney.

Eating is a purely animalish occupation
at the best of times; mimicry is a monkey-like
faculty that is most apeish when its votaries pre-
tend to eat something. We are led to these
reflections by beholding Percy Lyndal and
George Titheradge affecting to munch bill-
stickers’ paste and green playbills in “School” by
way of chicken and salad, and pretending to
enjoy their meal. Seeing “School ” again one is
more than ever convinced that it is a decidedly
clever piece of fooling. The author knew his
public, albeit a bit of a snob and a worshipper of
the golden calf. For instance, Beaufoy, a lordling
just intelligent enough to keep flies off the
ocular that isn’t eye-glassed, pokes Krux
with his rifle to attract his attention, and
Poyntz, a money ; hunting loafer, thrashes
the down-trodden usher, because he answers truth-
fully the hysterical queries of a doddering old
dude. “School” is doing good biz. for a third
revival, but will take unto itself an affix on Satur-
day when “Schoolmistress ” goes up with Maggie
Moore, after an absence of eight months, in her
old part. Manager Magee has triumphed over
influenza and lung-inflammation and is now to be
seen in front every evening.

It is altogether improbable that Jennie
Lee will ever get anything to suit her so well as
“Jo.” Still, as Collie in “ Run Wild ”at Sydney
Garrick she has better stuff to handle than has
recently fallen to her lot. Moreover, all round,
the little comedy-drama is well handled. Business
has been fairly good, but the last nights are
announced, and “Jo,” the everlasting, probably
goes up on Saturday.

With the fine weather Bondi has been so

Wiegand’s afternoon organ recitals don’t,
as a rule, draw more than 500 people to Sydney's
Town Hall, and to an outsider it looks as if the
.time had come to let the people of Sydney hear
their own pipe from the ground floor for a modest
threepence. Looking round at the rapt faces of
most people when the organist is dealing with the
solemn and grand, one finds it easy to account for
the goody-goody feeling that used to usher him
out of church in his callow days. ’Twas the
voluntary did it.

The Gerald-Duff season at Adelaide Royal
has been so far a financial failure. “Human
Nature” is a dreary, miserable, inane sort of
attempt at dramatic plot, and being acted for the
most part in a feeble, dreary style by a company
not overburdened with talent, has not caused
much of a stir. Following this up, the production
of Gerald and Duff’s “ original ” version of
“ Barnes of New York ’’ did not improve matters.
Possibly it was too original. The productions
have been well staged, but the contract was too
large for the material at hand, although Gerald,
Geo. Leopold and Alice Norton all worked hard
to make things go, and to bear up beneath a load
of mediocrity. “The Pointsman” will work his
feelings off next. Snazelle, opening to wretched
houses, has worked up a handsome business at the
Town Hall. Miss Snazelle and Philip Langdale
contribute towards the show.

That floating relic, the ancient convict-
hulk “ Success,” is moored this week at Circula l '
Quay, Sydney. It is a massive affair with a
leprous exterior, ponderous, exceedingly aged*
pimpled, and yellow, and crusted over with old-
time villainy. The outside is solid, and the decks
are solid, and down in the dim interior there are
rows upon rows of cells, where wax images of the
forgotten convicts loaf amid the gloom, and the
shadows, and the old, cast-off smells, like dead
men damned in a tank. They are a clammy
race, these deceased wax malefactors, and very
cold and fish-like and unresponsive, and they look
as if they had been waiting for centuries in a
grotto, and nothing had ever came of all their
waiting. Some of them look ferocious, but the
majority are only numb and depressed; it is
difficult to construct a howling wax fiend in any
case, and, besides, a man who roosts in solid dark-
ness, with nothing but the heave of his murky
tomb for company, gives up looking ferocious
after a while and looks mean and miserable
instead. Now and then the System took them
out, and hitched them to iron necklaces between-
decks, by way of change and variety; and at
other times it hauled them up on deck by a wind-
lass, and shoved them, five or six at a time,
into a cage, and washed them with a hose,
while a warder roused them up with a long
broom. It was a remarkably clean thing, the
old System, and it would take a prisoner’s skin
off if it couldn’t get the dirt away by any other
means. The murder of Captain Price is thrown
in as a joyous tableau, witli the officer on the
floor, and a wax homicide demolishing him with a
pickaxe; and one end of the lower deck is fitted
up as a sylvan glade, with the Kelly Gang boiling
its billy among the ferns. Ned Kelly's armour is
also on exhibition —a huge mass of rusty iron
that is calculated to be a good load for a camel,
and there are a band, and electric - lights, and
other attractions. The “ Success ”is doing well
in Sydney, but the enterprising management
propose shortly navigating the show to England,
which seeems a decidedly reckless undertaking.
For somewhere out on the waste of waters her
cargo of painted goblins may come to life again,
and seize the vessel, and cast the crew overboard
among the foam and the dolphins, and then they
will sail away, all yelling and cursing and clank-
ing their chains, and become a spectral crew
working out an interminable sentence on the sea.
And then the ghosts will rush shrieking up and
down the old teak decks, and wash each other
with the spectral pump in the bows, and haul
each other up from below by the time-worn wind-
less, and there will be howls and groans and blue
fire, and horrors unutterable.

Sells’ great circus has been struck by an
undeserved calamity at Sydney. On account of

On Saturday night, during the performance of

Sydney D.T. in a notice of “The Corsair,” now running

infliction as being “ delightfully funny.” So he is—just
about as gracefully humorous as a side of beef, as
delicately mirth-provoking as a string of German sausages,
or as daintily amusing as a beer-vat in tights.

“ Phytographise Australiie,” hut at night he really made
an intelligible speech, in amends for the Choctaw he
spoke on first sight of De Grade Egsbloraw.
Lady Lytton, Paris Ambassadrice, Lady Loch's twin
sister (Villiers), was the first to call on Melba after the
Orleans plum fell off the bough, over-ripe. • The affair of
Viceroy Lytton presenting the gold medal to Victoria
Cooke, empress of the circus-arena at Calcutta, here comes
to mind. It was a medal remaining over from the big
Delhi Durbar, and blasphemy was shouted.
Cherchez I’Actrice.
Did the Simonsens give a single opera that hadn't been
heard in Melbourne 100 times?
Teddy Royce is off to England.
Thespian: ‘“Rob Roy’ is good fora week’s business,
but, like Clark’s lecture on ‘ Westminster Abbey,’ Aus-
tralia grows more out of it every year.”
Fred. Terry and Julia Neilson were married the other
day, and acted the same night, in the “Dancing Girl,’
even as Charles Kean and Ellen Tree acted the “Honey-
moon ” the night of their marriage. A gallery fellow
sang out to Madge Robertson Kendal, in “ As You Like
It,” “ You wuz married to-day ; how do you like it?” and
she replied “ I don’t know yet.”
An Adelaide reporter found H. M. Stanley in a rather
fretful mood on the Arcadia. Henry’s leg isn’t right yet,
and his crutch is still required, if only tor advertising

Charles Warner is to bring out to Australia the troupe
of acrobats now performing at London Empire. Chawles
will, we presume, act on his head the part of Coupeau in
“Drink,” and do double handsprings whilst in the
D.T.’s.
Guy Boothby, the aspiring Adelaide dramatist, will not
now go to England. He lost over £l5O by bis three per-
formances, in Adelaide Royal, of “ The Jonquille.” The
worst of it is that Boothby threw up his billet in anticipa-
tion of his trip, and is now stranded.
The derelict Lyceum Theatre, in Pitt-street, Sydney,
about which there was litigation in the Equity Court last
week between Messrs. Muaton (builder) and Iv es (con-
tractor) has been taken possession of by the ground land-
lords, and a syndicate are now arranging for the purchase
of the lease and completion of the building.
Kyrle Bellew writes us from the Green-room Club,
London, under date 3rd October:— Mv Dear Bulletin, —
Your extremely entertaining paper, vi hich 1 never fail to
receive regularly, and which-pardon the apparent
flattery—is far better reading than any of the “funny”
papers on this side the world, generally devotes, and very
kindly, one or two paragraphs in each issue to Mrs. Potter
and myself. Correct reports cannot always be looked for
of people as far distant as the poles, so one cannot view
inaccuracies with a too unkindly eye. In your issue of
August 22, you notice a play by a clever young friend of
mine, named “Jonquille,” and honour me with partici-
pation in its authorship. I cannot allow, however flatter-
ing to myself, the credit for the play to he connected
with ray name in any way. A play often has a plurality
of fathers, but will you allow me, in this instance, to
deny any share in the paternity of Mr. Boothby’s on ray
part. There is a long and unpleasantly suggestive letter
also in the same issue, from a person signing himself
“Trotter Bethune,” of an incident supposed to have been
witnessed by him at 5.30 a.m. on the Essendon line. I
have only to remark in reference to it that “ Trotter
Bethune” was probably suffering from an overnight
debauch, which at that early hour rendered his eyesight
deceptive and himself irresponsible. Yours, 'Kvrle
Bellew.
George Rignold says that his tank plunge in “ The
Lights o’ London,” with the after application of hot
towels, contrary to medical opinion, did his influenza
good.
George K. Portescue, who “sees no objection to stout-
ness in moderation,” asserts that in woman parts he
endeavours to “ glide as much as possible, and it is my
pride to be able to say that ladies can see me in female
dress without feeling shocked.” Hum !
Poor Vincent West’s divorce case was to have been
heard on the 17th inst. ; death was a speedier and surer
divorcer than the tedious processes of the law courts.
West always caved in without a struggle before the most
trifling complaint, and, no doubt, died a victim to melan-
cholia. Harry Vincent, that was his true name, had the
most mournful eyes that ever looked out of the soul of a
human being, and was one of the most pessimistic of
mortals. Despite his fatalism, he had worked himself up
from being a chorus-singer with Simonsen’s Opera Co.,
and had a future before him.
Frances Saville, now studying under Marches!, in Paris,
is also learning Italian, by advice of Lady Carington, says
papa Martin Simonsen.
“ Daddy” Lohr is now in Sydney arranging for the
Criterion appearance of Williamson’s Juvenile Comic

polish on the kids, the Pollards-first to work the juvenile
biz up in Australia—and C. Wand, conductor, look after
the musical training, Nellie Greenlees gives the terpsi-
chorean finish, and other instructors look after the
“ three R’s.”
The S.M. Herald says that Walter Bentley’s father,
the late Dr. Begg, was “ a popular divine” of Melbourne
city. The combative doctor may have been popular in
Melbourne, but he only visited that city briefly, during- a
twenty-five-year-ago tour of Australasia.
The Misses Albu are taking professional farewell of
Australia in a series of Sunday Coogee Aquarium con-
certs. They leave per ’Frisco mailboat en route to South

The “Dancing Girl” closed the Villiers’ season in
Sydney on Wednesday, last week. Some of the company
will support Walter Bentley in later pieces at Melbourne
Royal ; others return to England by first opportunity.
The Comte de Paris allegedly won't allow his son, Hie
Due d’Orleans, to fight “Kangaroo" Charlie, because
the latter is a commoner. A much better reason is that
Armstrong is a first-class swordsman ; good with single-
sticks, foils, rapiers, anything in short. If you don't
believe it, ask Larry Foley. Mr. Melba put him through
at the extinct Australian Athletic Club on his last visit to
Sydney.
Walter Bentley docs not want to travel cn the tartan

Mildred Birch, the Australian soprano, is studying in
Paris with Madame Dietz.
W. J. Holloway has secured the Australian rights of
“Glorina.” Glorina?
The only other Walter Bentley we can call to mind was
William Larnan Blanchard. He adopted the stage-name
for the same reason as did William Begg—because the
initials were those of his real name.
It is not Roland Watts Phillips who is writing the
deceased playwright's memoir, but her aunt Emma, his

A Napoleon play is a success in London, but they will
never get anyone to make up for it like Miln.
Sara Bernhardt writes a learned article, in San Fran-
cisco Examiner, proving the inferiority of the stage to all
the other arts.
Many of Bernhardt's little notes are preserved here,
evidences of her kindly disposition, and she writes her
pin-pointy hand on little square paper, with a kind of
pale mourning border, while her crest is both on note and
envelope-a head of Thalia, with crossed daggers, and
motto, “Quand Memo.”
Bland Holt has purchased the two latest London suc-
cesses, “ A Sailor’s Knot ” and “The Trumpet Call,” both
of which are to be produced in Sydney as soon as the
gentle prophet of the back hair can find an abiding place
there.
Poor old Billy Leake, who has been ailing for some con-
siderable time, has had to “ go under ” at last, and is now
seriously ill at the Adelaide Hospital.
His last ad. is “ Stanley, the Missionary.”
The stories about the precautions taken by Madame
Melba and her alleged lover to evade the service of legal
documents prejudice her case considerably in the Austra-
lian public mind. However, it must be remembered that
the reports are only cablegrams.
“The Bulletin” Christinas Number.
The Christmas Number of The Bulletin will be
issued on 17th December.
The Bulletin Christmas Number will embody
original literary contributions from twenty of
the foremost Australian writers, and illustra-
tions from all the representative Australian

The Bulletin Christmas Number will not con-
sist of cheap imported stories shared with a
hundred other papers throughout the world.
The Bulletin Christmas Number will not be
made up of one prize-story and a prize-
picture and a lot of other matter and
pictures procured gratis from confiding “com-
petitors.”
The Christmas Bulletin, though double the size
of the ordinary weekly issue, will be published
at the usual price, Sixpence.
Agents will please send in their orders before

Rudyard Kipling landed in Australia at

Editor Brient, of Sydney D.T., is, we
regret to say, terribly ill of pneumonia—the
effects of an influenza relapse. He can only be
expected to recover very slowly, and his case was
at one stage regarded as almost hopeless.
Signor Nerli, of Sydney, one of the most
gifted artists who has ever visited Australia, is a
grandson of Captain Medwin, the friend and
biographer of Byron and Shelley, and his father
and mother were close friends of Walter Savage
Landor and the Brownings.
When a Sydney Pullman car (carrying
among others, the N.S.W. viceregal party) took
fire the other day on the journey to Melbourne, a
devoted snob (seeing there was no danger, of
course) screamed out: “Oh do save the dear
Governah !” He was heartily laughed at.
A second edition of that most successful
book, The Bulletin’s Illustrated “ History of
Botany Bay,” is now ready. A copy will be
mailed to any Australian address for Is. 4d. in

One of the pleasant features about the
crack-up of the Anglo-Australian Co., is that the
uncalled capital has been pledged to the London
debenture-holders; in other words it has been
pawned and the company only holds the ticket.
Tins uncalled-capital looked a very large and
solid item, and the miserable depositor naturally
felt that he must be safe with such a large security
to fall back upon. Yet in reality there was no
security at all—it ivas all gone up the British
spout. The situation seems very much the same
as that of the embarrassed soft-goods individual,
who pawns his stock, or puts a bill-of-sale upon
his furniture to the detriment of his creditors.
He may use the money thus obtained in paying
his debts ; but still the mere fact that he has
given security to one creditor while the rest are
left out, is described by sundry hard names, and
the misguided person generally gets nasty knocks
or worse, from the Bankruptcy Judge. If this
rule were extended it might do a lot of good to
quite a lot of so-called banks.

POLITICAL POINTS
Graham Berry lost his deposit at seven
Parliamentary elections.
“If a man smote me on one cheek 1 d
plug him in the eye.”— Copeland, N.S. W. Minister
of Lands,
Victorian Opposition has four leaders—
Gillies, Deakin, “Jingo” Patterson, and Sir
Bryan O’Loghlen.
Pat Perkins, Brisbane’s Boer King, says
that “ anarchy and disorder should be put down
with a firm hand.” Hie !
Parkes’s latest: “I do not know that I
am quite lost to the Legislature of the country.
Not lost but gone behind.
Prof. Pearson retires from the representa-
tion of Brunswick, in the Victorian Assembly, to
give Berry the chance of the seat.
The Dibbs (N.S.W.) Ministry consists of
fou-r lawyers, one merchant, one baker, one ship-
owner, two graziers, and one miner.
Judging by the attendance at Sydney
Woman Suffrage meetings, the Labour Party is
rapidly becoming the Lady Party.
Tasmania's Treasurer expects the present
year to close with a total revenue of £900,000
against an expenditure of £849,507.
The most aggressive being in the world is
a baby. The baby bosses every household. The
New Unionism is the baby of politics.
Of the members of the Victorian Royal
Commission appointed in TO to consider the
question of Australian Federation but Gavan
Duffy, Edward Langton, and Graham Berry are
alive.
Can N.S.W. Treasurer See transfer the,
singular success of his individual operations to his
official work? Out of a few long-shore boats that
could be counted on one’s fingers, John See has
evolved a fine fleet of vessels.
For a considerable time during a recent
sitting of the Victorian Assembly, Sir Bryan
O’Loghlen was the only member on the Opposition
benches. The other Oppositionists were in caucus,
funking the alleged crisis.
Eight members of the One-man-one-voto
Dibbs Ministry have non-residential votes in
East Sydney. Three, for rooms at the Australian
Club ; three, for offices ; one, for property ; and
one, for a wharf-interest.
Sir Graham Berry is to be fare welled in
London with a banquet, patronised by Lords
Brassey and Knutsford. Which should bo a
sufficient credential for a prompt political funeral
by the Victorian democratic party.
Melbourne Age is at its old see-saw game.
In a recent issue it published two leading articles
— one blackguarding the English Tories and the
other blackguarding the Australian Radicals-
This is what we call a Coalition paper.
Says Pall Mall Gazette ;
Anything tinged with a certain sort of warm-blooded
Socialism will go down in Australia; but it is only in
Victoria and South Australia that it gains much by its
combination with organised forms of religion.
“N.S.W. has now a Ministry pledged to
both Federation and Protection. This is a natural
alliance.” Extract from an essay by Joseph
Palmer, Esq., boss freetrader, president of Sydney
Stock Exchange and —denouncer of gambling.
When J. A. Gorrick was contesting the
Wollombi, at the recent N.S.W. general election,
an elector asked his view’s on the Women -Suffrage
question. “ Well,” answered the candidate,
quickly, “a man and his wife are one, and I
object to plural voting.”
A hint for the Parliamentarians who
would give Parkes <£lo,ooo or <£20,000 as a parting
douceur. Give him the old Sobraon (worth about
<£4000) for which he paid .£11,500 out of tire State
Treasury. Or, hand him a hatful of his own
I O U’s and cry square. That will cost nobody
anything, and will give the ancient frost a new
start.
The Melbourne Social Purity Society has
worked up the record of every member of the
Victorian Parliament, and “the report is duly
filed at the office.” The legislative gentlemen had
now better work up the records of the Social
Purity men, and duly file them at the office as a
supplement to the “History of Whited Sepul-
chres.”
Dear B ulletin, —Be Woman - suffrage.
There must be only one master in every house. Let
the legislature see that a man and his wife shall be
entitled not to two votes but to one vote between
them, such vote to be polled jointly. Whichever
of the pair happens to be master will control that
vote. In the event of a disagreement no vote to
be recorded. —E.B.
The present N.S.W. Ministry promises
law-reform. Apropos, why should a mere chair-
man of Quarter Sessions have the power of inflict-
ing any sentence short of death ? Cases involving
punishment for life should be tried in the Supreme
Court. In civil matters minor Judges have juris-
diction up to £2OO only, while in criminal cases
they can imprison for life ! A legacy- from Eng-
land, the nation of shopkeepers.
The question of the territorial separation
of North and Central Queensland from South
'Queensland has dropped down a hole in the par-
liamentary floor and won’t be again raised this
session. Meanwhile, Northerners think that their
chances are much improved with Knutsford by
their Parliamentary defeat. Premier Griffith is
grimly reticent on the subject.
If one can believe Captain O’Shea (a
difficult matter, by the way), Parnell ac jniesced
in the opinion that of all the Irish party, the
falsest is Dillon, the lowest Tim Healy and T. P.
O Connor, and the most contemptible Justin
M‘Car thy. This is probably a lie, but it is the
gallant Captain’s way ot trying to reconcile the
memory of the late Irish leader to his quondam
followers.
The S.A. Assembly have cut down to
£lOO the expenses that may be legally incurred in
contesting a Parliamentary constituency of 2000
electors —this to bo inclusive of all advertising
expenses. Something of the sort is sadly wanted
in N.S.W., where a certain wealthy foreign-trade
member who has hitherto had a sure seat in a
4000-vote constituency, has regularly paid his
■co nmittee a pound per vote on—we don’t say for
—all votes polled.
The Queensland “ Pensions Bill of 1891 ”
provides that any pensioner who becomes a
member of Parliament or a Minister of the Crown
“hall, during his tenure of either position, forfeit
his pension. The Bill is in reality aimed at Chief
Justice Lilley, whose 15 years’ contract of judi-
cial office is about to expire, and who has signified
his willingness to re-enter politics as the Radical
leader. Griffith has never forgiven Lilley for
having once in Parliament styled him “a petti-
fogging lawyer.”
Since Responsible Government in N.S.W.
the Attorneys-General have been -Manning, 5
times; Martin, 5; Darva.ll, 3; Lutwyche, 1;
L. H. Bayley, 1; Edward Wise, 1; Hargrave, 2;
J. H. Plunkett, 1; Butler, 1; limes, 1; Dailey,
3; Windeyer, 2; W. J. Foster, 2; Wisdom,!;
Want, 2; Simpson, 3; B. R. Wise, 1 ; Barton, 2.
The figure nine occurs prominently in this con-
nection. Nine of the Attorneys-General became
Judges, and, of course, nine did not. Nine are
dead, and as a consequence nine are alive. Nine
arc natives, and nine are not; nine were called to

MAGISTRATE (to witness —actor who, in his evidence, pretends to he afflicted with stuttering):

The spineless Sydney Telegraph —that
poor old paper with the haggard expression and
the fallen-in literary stomach —is still wailing.
Its latest complaint is that the Dibbs Govern-
ment, by establishing Protection, will thereby
make Federation impossible. Yet it must
be evident that Protection is the only pos-
sible road to Federation. When Federation
comes, there can be no more inter-provin-
cial tariffs. Therefore, the three Protec-
tionist provinces which abut on N.S. Wales,
assuredly won’t federate so long as N.S.W. is
run on the Foreign-trade system, lor then they
would be swamped by masses of imported shoddy,
landed at Sydney and fired over the border,
thereby entirely destroying the effects of their
own tariffs. They can federate when N.S.W.
goes solid for Protection, but till then it is prac-
tically impossible.
W. O. Hodgkin son, in a recent oration
which he threw like a great slab at the head of
the Queensland Assembly, announced that
“there were hundreds of places in the colony at
the present time where every man could get a fair
wage if he liked to tackle the work.” This is all
the use that the old and slimy variety of
politician is to his country ; ho fires off heavy,
unfinished statements,, and then sits down. For
the miserable Hodgkinson didn’t mention even
one of these places, and he hasn’t mentioned one
of them since. He knew—or, at least, he had
been informed—that there were hundreds of
people almost utterly destitute in Brisbane alone,
and he also knew—unless he was an appalling
perverter of the truth—hundreds of places where
they could all find employment, and he -was too
mean to help his fellow-man by giving the
address. The Bulletin wants to know the
names of these places badly.
The Brazilian Republic seems to be already
falling to pieces for want of one brainy man to
run the show. The Brazilians made a huge mistake
at the very beginning of the movement. When
they wiped out Dorn Pedro as Emperor they ought
to have started the Republic by making the grand
old potentate first President of the new Common-
wealth. He would probably have taken the
post, and beyond the shadow of a doubt be would
have filled it honourably, for —Emperor though he
was— Pedro was the truest republican in all South
America. Also, he was a noble gentleman with
neither spot nor stain on his record, and Brazil
will not grow such another man in ten centuries.
It would have been a grand spectacle _to see
the latest-born Republic start by choosing its
dethroned monarch first chief of the State, but
the new men were small and narrow and common-
place, and so the only country on earth which
could have ventured on such an experiment threw
the chance away.
The N.S.W. Single-tax potentates make a
noise altogether out of proportion to their number.
The local Labour Electoral League rules have
been so drafted-probably through Single-tax
influence—as to allow the membership of people
living outside the district in which a league is
supposed specially to operate. Thus, for instance,
a man may belong to Newtown L.E.L. without
residing at Newtown, or being an elector of that
constituency. Nor is any limit placed upon the
number of leagues to which he may belong, and
so it happens that the Sinode-tax bosses each
belong to several leagues, have a lot to say
wherever they go—and, being always “on the
job,” carry about a floating majority with them.
When they visit the country they, of course, don’t
talk too much Single-tax to the farmers, among
whom they appear as Freetraders only, and when
they find it judicious, they talk Labour without
any reference to either Single-tax or Freetrade.
The way to keep these bogus maj irities in their
proper place, is to allow people to belong only to
the league of the district in which they reside.
“A straw shows, &c.” The Hummer, a
paper just started at Wagga, and professedly in
the secret as to the intentions of the N.S.W.
Labor-party, asks why the parliamentary repre-
sentatives of the workers should not get George
Reid “to lead the true-hearted democrats from
both sides,” defer the fiscal question until electoral
reform lias been accomplished, and then submit
the issue to a vote of the whole people. The
Bulletin approves of the plebiscite idea on
national questions, but fails to completely follow
the esoteric springs of the Hummer’s anticipatory
joy when it thus jubilates (italics ours): —
In a Coalition Ministry formed on these lines we could
have such sterling fellows as Tom Ewing, of Richmond
River, and his mate, Perry; Austin Chapman, of Braid-
wood ; and very likely O’Sullivan, Traill, and other good,
sound democrats from the Protectionist side of the
House. Campbell, of Illawarra; Lonsdale, from New
England ; B. R. Wise, and Jack Haynes, from the Free-
trade Camp, could all join hands, and form a strong party
under the leadership of a man like G. H. Reid.
-Oil, vinegar, sugar, eggs, lusoiousness, and
putridity—what a salad ! The Hummer christens
this combination a “Federated People’s Party !”
Baronet Clarke opened Jus mouth once
(except for yawning) during the “dual vote”
discussion in the Vic. Legislative Council. A
succession of ponderous old members had been
enlarging on the rights of Proputty, and the
absurdity of reckoning one whole landlord as one
plain ordinary man, when Clarke took the floor
and fired the bewildering suggestion that tenants
ought to have two votes, because many of them
are “ superior men to their landlords.” Then the
baronet sat down amidst an awesome silence. He
evidently meant well, and was doubtless making a
generous allusion to his own tenants, but the
other old gentlemen felt that their exalted
colleague was getting socialistic and obscure. He
was opening up problems. The man who owned
one house and rented the house next door would
evidently want four votes. Also the lodger who
pays a landlord half his rent for a couple of un-
furnished rooms would claim one vote and a half,
and the boarders at every hash-house would
certainly howl for an extra decimal fraction of a
vote apiece. The matter was altogether too deep
for Proputty to find the bottom.
Thus R. Kelland, referring to the recent
Queensland Parliamentary votes in favour of
money-grants to the widows Macrossan and
Jordan “If the widows of those who serve the
State in Parliament, and get good salaries for
doing so, are to receive grants of .£2OOO, tlier
corresponding grants should be made to th ( '
widows of those who have had to provide the
wherewithal for the payment of the said salaries
and special votes ”
A Dubbo woman has just successfully
weanei a deaf-and-dumb ventriloquist, while
Wagga can boast of an astronomer who has been
blind from his birth.
In Berlin most of the tobacconists have
the telephone laid on, and all you have to do if
you want to use it is to purchase a penny cigar
and you may talk away to your heart’s content!
This facility has its disadvantages—for the man
at the other end of the wire. The facility f or
dunning tardy debtors is too apparent, and there
is just the chance that all your angry creditor says
may be overheard. Fancy, say, Friedman’s or
Rogalsky’s being laid on to the N.S.W. Lands
Office ! —or Marks Hermann on to the Melbourne
Education Department.
John Haynes once lectured in Bathurst on
Freetrade, political sins, and such-like themes
and induced W. H. Suttor to take the chair!
In the course of the speech, John got so abusive
of G. R. Dibbs that the chairman stopped him
as Mr. Dibbs was a personal friend. Which
reminds “A Bathurst Burr’’that W. H. Suttor
sat by, without a squirm, during a long two
hours, while Parkes used his choicest Billingsgate
towards Frank Suttor, the present Minister for
Education, and brother to W.H.'S. aforesaid.
Writes our London correspondent :—“A
friend of the deceased ‘ Uncrowned King’ asserts
me that Parnell never thoroughly believed in
Gladstone’s conversion to Home Rule. He never
trusted the G.0.M., who, he thought had too
superficial a knowledge of Irish history, which ho
did not commence to study until he saw that the
Irish party would have to be reckoned with both
in and out of the House of Commons. It was this
firm disbelief which prompted him to take up the
gage so warmly when Mr. Gladstone so readily
availed himself of the O’Shea business to insist on
Parnell’sretirement. I have every reason to believe
this, for my informant is one of the few men who
has ever been admitted even to the slightest in-
timacy with the remarkable man who has just
passed away.”
W. C Wentworth inclined to the belief
that the Government of the day in distributing the
rewards for the discovery of gold in N.S.W.
should have allotted Tom, Lister, and Simpson
Davison proportions of the votes, instead of giving
Hargraves so large a sum. Davison might, by all
the equities of the case, have certainly come in
for a larger share than Hargraves, and yet he never
received a penny, neither did Tom or Lister who
found the gold which Hargraves showed to the
Government in proof of his contention that he
had made the discovery. The currently-accepted
notion as to Hargraves’ responsibility for the dis-
coveries will have to be knocked on the head, like
many other notions similarly given currency to by
lazy journalists and lazier “authors.” Davison
was a man of very remarkable attainments,
scientific and literary, and his letters to the
Empire— particularly No. 8 of the series—were as
well-done a piece of satire as has ever appeared in
Australia.
It is singular, seeing how much depends
on good health, that a little more pains is not
taken to impress on the people a few simple rules
for its preservation. Thus, bad drainage is the
main cause of typhoid fever, which kills 20,000
people in England yearly. Small and low bed-
rooms engender consumption and loss of vitality
unless well ventilated, not only in the day-time,
but at night. An ill-ventilated bedroom is a
frequent cause of sleeplessness. Children are
especially sufferers from badly-ventilated bed-
rooms. That is the chief cause why children of
the poor look so sickly. It may be said that
people have a right to be filthy. So they have,
unless they are an active annoyance and danger
to their neighbours. For that reason there is
greater logic in prosecuting a dirty than a drunken
man. Where disease heralds its approach by such
signs as indigestion, headache, neuralgia, tired
aching limbs and other well-known symptoms, a
course of Clements Tonic will quickly restore the
normal health as instanced in the case of His
Honor Judge Miller, who writes :—“ Court House,
Winton, Queensland, June 10, ’9l.—Last Decem-
ber while travelling from Muttaburra to-Winton,
I was suddenly seized with a violent attack of
vomiting and diarrhoea. On my arrival at Winton,
Mr. Campbell (of Corfield and Fitzmaurice) per-
suaded me to take Clements Tonic ; one dose
relieved me. I continued to take it for two days,
at the expiration of which I was completely re-
covered, and I have much pleasure in testifying
to the beneficial effects I experienced from taking
it. —Granville George Miller, Judge of the Central
District Court, Winton.”
Take Ayer’s Fills, and bo cured. Misery is a
mild word to describe the sufferings of body and
mind, caused by habitual constipation. A
moderate use of Ayer's Pills will invariably
regulate the bowels.
That’s logic, sir, and so’s the bit
That I am going to submit.
I work as hard as any man—
That is, I work whene’er I can.
And what is more, as i contend,
Is—all the cash I get, I spend.
My money’s always got full wings,
And flies away in taxed things.
In baooa, tea, and “ mountain dew
In fact, I prop the revenue.
And when I die, my widow will
Be pushed to pay my coffin bill.
She’ll have, when I am gone to dust,
To earn before she eats her crust.
A bonus, then, is fairly due
To one who props the revenue.
And, lest my widow meets mischance,
I’ll take her bonus in advance.

Labouchere has taken Prince Collars and

Montague ” told a fib to screen him, what business
is it of anybody else? They won’t allow Cuffs to
marry the girl he wants.
In some respects, close observers are in-
clined to think that Gladstone is not quite the
man ho was. “He is not able to follow the intri-
cacies of an elaborate argument and wind into the
subject with the same sinuous (kill as of yore.
His memory fails him occasionally, and his facts
are not quite so reliable as they used to be.”
Christie Murray has, in the Contemporary
for October, gone in for praising up “ The Vaga-
bond.” He does not actually name him, but the
allusion to the “loyal friend, good comrade, good
fellow, and prince of wanderers ” is as clear as it
is gracefully done. The“Yag.”is very popular
amongst the many men of letters whom he has
met in England.
Is this a coincidence ? The novel on
which Rudyard Kipling is engaged is to be called
“Mother Maturin.” W. H. Maturin, who was
Clerk of Council in South Australia in the earliest
Fifties, was nicknamed “Mother” Maturin in
consequence of his old-womanish characteristics.

Among the letters of introduction which a
certain Australian Governor carried to the
kawlinies, was one from the Prince of Wales to
a chum of the giddy days gone by. The Governor
has only just succeeded in discovering the where-
abouts of the quondam chum of the coming K.
Inquiries fixed him as a habitual drunkard and
promiscuous inhabitant of Sydney Domain.
Labouchere on Disraeli :
This astute and unscrupulous Hebrew had laid himself
out to obtain the Queen’s favour. On his first admission
to her Court it is related of him that he assured her that
he owed his success as au orator to a careful study of the
Prince Consort’s speeches, all of which he committed to
heart; and his entire subsequent intercourse with her
was conducted in a like vein of Oriental hyperbole.
Lord Sheffield, who heads the English
team of cricketers now at Adelaide, is a little
podgy man, almost as broad as he is long; the
crowd laughed hugely when he waddled across
Adelaide Oval with two or three of his sturdy
players. The Earl is clean-shaven with the ex-
ception of a straggly, half-moon Irish beard under
the chin. He spends plenty of money, and
threatens to be very popular.
Old Jock Winter, sire of Winter-Irving,
M.L.C. (Vic-), was a sturdy old warrior with no
frills, and hated “dressy ” men. At his home on
the Devil’s River he was once interviewed by a
man with a well-waxed moustache and looking as
if he had just stepped out of a fashion-plate. The
meetincr was not of a cordial rature, and, on the
beau taking his departure, he passed some remark
which aroused Jock’s ire. Jock chased him, caught
him, knelt on his chest, deprived him of his
moustache with a foot-rotting knife, and was all
smiles and sunshine for more than a week after.
Stanley on Emin Pasha to an Adelaide
Reporter: —
An utterly indecisiv e man ; a man with no mind of his
own. Very well learned, of course, in bugs and beetles,
and a most interesting talker on all matters of natural
history. Yes, a charmingly interesting man, a good con-
versationalist, a man just suited, for instance, for a lady’s
afternoon tea-party
We remember reading something stronger than
this. It was Emin Pasha’s opinion of Stanley.
David Syme prints in his own paper an
advertisement given him by Patchett Martin,
writing in Liverary Opinion ;
Only two so-called Australian writers have displayed
profound erudition or original philosophical capacity, the
late Dr. Hearn, author of the Aryan Household and
Philology, and Mr. David Syme, who has so daringly
crossed swords with the Darwinians in his suggestive
work On the Modification of Organisms. But neither
Mr. Syme nor Dr. Hearn saw Australia until after he had
reached manhood.
Modest and tasteful, ain’t it?
Stanley has deducted 99 per cent, from
Phil. Robinson’s graphic account of how he wrote
up and rounded “Through the Dark Continent,”
from the dictation of that apotheosised nigger-
slayer. Speaking at a Savage Club dinner, Stan-
ley, the leading savage of the evening, observed,
fixing his eye upon the man at whom he was talk-
ing, “There is a gentleman present who claims to
have assisted me in my literary work. I take the
opportunity of telling that gentleman to his face
that ho is’ a liar.” Phil R. was the gentleman
present, and he swallowed the soft impeachment
without a murmur.
Dr. Rutter, of Parramatta, N.S.W., has a
deal to answer for. Out with a hunting-party in
Warwickshire some seventy years ago, rain coming
on they adjourned to a roadside cottage. There a
sturdy youngster was continually making" signs to
his mother when he wanted to attract her atten-
tion. On enquiry she stated that he was deaf and
dumb, but the good doctor, who knew better,
called round the next day and cut a rigid muscle
that prevented the tongue from wagging. That
child was ex-Premier Parkes. It is only fair to say
Parkes denies this and asserts that he had the use
of all his faculties at birth. He ought to know.
He was there.
0. Hutton, who thinks he remembers
Lord Salisbury as a young man on the Victorian
goldfields, writes: —
I think he was working at Golden Point, near Castle-
maine. There were two young fellows, and they lived in
a very comfortable framed tent, and dug a hole and
bottomed it about 20 or 30 yards away from their tent.
What made it so remarkable was that they had a servant
in livery to carry the picks and shovels from the tent to
their claim. They were not rigged out like miners,
having white shirts. The diggers when they passed used
to sing out “ Joe ! ” but they took no notice of it. I sup-
pose that must have been Salisbury. The lime was either
December, 1851, or January, 1852, shortly after we arrived
on the diggings, and like unexperienced diggers they
sunk their claim on solid ground away from the lead of
gold.
Bir Richard Temple, the man with the
largest, reddest, bulgiest, and most shiny nose in
England, is going to retire from the House of
Commons at the end of the present Parliament.
He was once Governor of Bombay, but came home
when Disraeli was in his zenith to hunt for the
office of Viceroy at Calcutta. As a preliminary
he called on the eminent Hebrew, and was ushered
into the drawing-room. Lady Beaconsfield was
there; she was weak and nervous, and when she
saw this fearful proboscis coming in she shrieked
and fainted. Disraeli heard the row and coming
down the stairs ten at ajump he found Sir Richard
hovering _ over the insensible lady and sniffing
in an agitated fashion. They were never quite
friendly after that, and Temple never became a
Governor again.
It is well known that between Hargraves,
the alleged gold-discoverer, and the Rev. W. B.
Clarke, the famous geologist, there was no love
lost. Hargraves took every opportunity to depre-
cate Clarke’s judgment as “mere theory,” “book
knowledge only,” and so forth. The antagonism
of the two had been smouldering from the date of
Hargraves’ first application to the Government for
a reward (3rd April, 1851), but burst into flame
when Hargraves followed Clarke in inspecting the
Araluendistrict. Clarkedescribes tbegold-bearing
characteristics of the region in the most glowing
terms and prophesied a rich future for it. Har-
graves, in his report, sneered at Clarke’s judgment,
and “ventured to assert the field would prove
next to worthless.” Clarke’s judgment was con-
firmed almost to the very letter, as the Araluen
deposits were rich, abundant, and of considerable
depth.
Sir Janies Martin used to claim, with some
degree of pride, that his “Australian Sketch
Book,” published in 1838, was the first literary
production “ that ever emanated from the pen of
an individual educated in Australia.” He was
wrong; the first purely literary work, pub-
lished here, was by a locally-educated native,
Charles Tompson, who subsequently became
clerk of_ the Legislative Assembly, N.S.W.
Tompson’s book is a bibliographical curiosity.
It is the only work printed with the imprint
“Australia” —not Sydney, N.S.W., but simply
“ Australia ’’—and this at a time when the official
designation of the continent at large was still
“ New Holland.” Young Tompson’s father kept
a beer-shop in George-street, and the young poet
used to squat on the bar-counter and read his
verses to the customers. It is not recorded that
the habit drove the drinkers away and his father
pi to insolvency.
“ Blind’' Jackson, of Bathurst-, N.S.W.,
died of influenza the other day. He had been
stone blind for 42 years, and a familiar feature of
Bathurst for more than half-a-century.
King Jackey, one of the last of the
Monaro (N.S.W.) blacks, died at Cooma, cn 7th
inst., of influenza, at the ancient age of “nine
feller big feller floods; plenty feller little feller
floods.”
The Age’s latest and lengthiest attack upon
The Bulletin appeared in last Saturday’s issue.
For this occasion only the deplorable example of
successful penny journalism sank so low as to
lickspittle the mendacious parson lately in charge
of Melbourne D.T., and the spectacle of Ananias
patting the dog that has bitten him a thousand
times is absolutely painful. Says David Syme, or
his fully-instructed myrmidon; “Mr. Fitchett
pledges his word (!) that they (Bulletin admirers)
don’t number one in a thousand of the newspaper
reading public, and after a cursory glance at its
contents we can quite believe it,” which means, in
unintentional English, that the Age believes The
Bulletin. Bad grammar, however, is not worth
noticing in a daily paper. Now, when the Age
professes to believe Fi-tchett’s lie that orthodox
journal simply lies again in its unclean teeth, but
when, as the result of a “cursory glance” the
lumbering animal proceeds to quote long extracts
from The Bulletin it goes out of its dull,
stupid way to hold itself up to ridicule. Not one
“ cursory glance,” but years of cursory considera-
tion has the Age given to the paper which at last
makes the wounded beast howl in impotent rage.
And the impotency of this anger is comic to con-
template. Quoting from a Bulletin leader, the
Age takes a carefully-perverted old figure of speech
in the same solemn spirit with which Sir James
Macß. accepted the harmless joke of the friend,
who said “All hail, Macßain !” “ It’s all hail,
Macbeth, I’m thinkin’,” replied the ponderous
President of the Legislative Council. In like
manner the slow-witted “morning dreary”
scratched its fat head and murmured—“lt ought
to be loins, ye ken,” upon coming across the
Bulletin’s reference to the Single-tax League
“girding up its brains for the fray.” David Syme
is Scotch —that’s all.

The average monthly interments at Rcok-
wood, Sydney’s great cemetery, are 140. This
month people have been buried at the rate of 35
a day—and 35 x 31 equals 1085 ! Forty-seven
gravediggers have been working day and night,
and it has frequently been found impossible to get
men for the work.
Doctors have also been scarce in Sydney, arid
Mr. Bruck, the medical agent, has offered double
the ordinary fees without securing the services of
enough qualified men to take up the running for
his disabled clients. However, had the Bruck
been able to get all the doctors be asked for, it is
quite likely that the city would have found itself
50 per cent, short of gravediggers.

The sudden flight of Gov. Jersey from
Melbourne the other week was not to be wondered
at, for he is naturally a retiring sort of earl, and
the frequent indispositions of his vice-regal hostess
embarrassed him beyond measure. Theatres are
the only places where my lady Hopetoun doesn’t
appear to “come over faint” of late. Behind the
curtains of a private box at the Bijou or Princess’
the fair daughter of Erin can sit and look amiable
for three hours at a stretch, but most other enter-
tainments are found too trying. A couple of
months back she thought to enjoy a nice, long
Sunday morning at the Anglican Cathedral. It
was not to be, however. Before the service was
fairly on its legs Lady H. had fled from the
sacred building, with an aide tumbling after her.
She didn’t even come back for a minute to hear
the shepherd call down a blessing on our beloved
Queen and family.
* * *
The other day a Sydney man was divorced
by his wife, the evidence against him being bis
own admissions and the testimony of a bosom
friend of his, with whom he walked down the
street in quite a friendly way a day or two after-
wards. Two nights after the Judge had pro-
nounced a rule nisi, the divorced man was seen
to hand his ex-wife into a cab at the theatre-door
in a most amiable manner. Toujours la politesse!
* # #
A lady—one of the fortunate drawers in
Tattersall’s sweep—on calling for her cheque
(£9OOO in the second sweep) said : “ I and another
lady went ’alves in it just for a bit of fun.”
When asked if she had laid anything off she
replied, “I don’t know what that is.” She also
remarked that her husband was returning from
the country on the morrow, in total ignorance of
the fortune that awaited him. What a blissful
re-union ! What a more than heavenly jewel such
a wife would seem !
• * «
Ajiropos of the attempt to disrupt the
N.S.W. Art Society—it is as well to here mention
an eminently weak spot in the armour of that
body. Leading members and chief exhibitors of
the society form the hanging committee for the
annual show, which affords a colour of evidence
that the pictures are arranged on the “ claw-me-
claw-thee ” principle. Why should not the work
of hanging be deputed to some uninterested out-
sider—say one of the local picture-dealers ? It is
impossible for exhibitors to strike fair balances
between themselves and other people. No man
is a competent judge in his own cause.

Sydney that she had married Darmont, Duquesne

The accounts of how W. J. Clarke (Sir)
met with his hard financial “knocks” vary con-
siderably, but to the fact that the bald-headed
Bart, is (in a Crcesian sense only, mind you) “hard
up ” there is plenty of expert evidence flying
around Melbourne. A comparative scarcity of
ready money drives him to Europe, where he will
escape for a while the necessity of saying “ No
hateful to him after years of putting his hand in
his pocket—to the people who had come to regard
old butcher Clarke’s first-born as a free loan-office
and a subscription-dispensary. Although political
economy kicks hard against men like W.J.C. he
is at least Australian in his respect for the soil
which produces his unearned income, and lie isn’t
sneaking “ home ” for the purpose of setting up as
an Anglo-Colonial and buying the occasional
smiles of bong-tong with Cargantuan dinners,
like Salmon Wilson and other members of the
bloated “absentee” brotherhood.

It is usual to assume that the old Ausfcra

areas. Therefore did a certain squatter, the
pick of wh ise run consisted of old grants, lately
engage a surveyor to determine the exact acreage.

several thousands of credited goodly acres, the
old grants proved short, and in consequence, a
heavy bribe had to be paid to secure the silence

Scot who effected the measurement.

The Free Presbyterian Synod of Victoria
has passed, amongst others, the following reso-
lution :
This Synod agrees to record solemnly an acknowledg-
ment of the rod in God's hands by which the recent wide-
spread malady called influenza lias swept so many in this
colony and some of the members of this church to their
long home.
In fact, the Synod agreed to give the Deity a
solemn receipt for its chastisement. In the next
breath the Synod recorded its—
Sense of desert of God’s afflictive visitations by Church
and State.
Which requires much untangling. Does the Synod
accuse the Almighty of afflicting sneezers by
Church and State ? Or does it record the Church’s
and the State’s deserts of catarrh ? Do Pro-
vidential “ afflictive” visitations invariably come
per snuffle? Again, if the Almighty is epidemic
influenza, is Beelzebub the antidotal perchloride
of mercury? Under the circumstances, there is
more anti-pneumonic virtue in a shilling bottle of
eucalyptus oil that in the whole continent-full of
Presbyterian Synods.

A fqvv days ago an old Sydney identity
(William Dean) died, according to doctor’s certi-
ficate, of influenza. He was a solitary, withered
old man, who livfed no one knew how—no one
cared. He had a few thousands in hard cash at
one of the banks, but his solicitor found that his
property amounted to £40,000. The old man had
lived alone for the past 30 years. A char-woman
who attended - his house weekly, visited the
lawyer one morning and informed him that her
master was dying really of starvation, that he
had not even a bed in his house to die on, and that
he would not let her buy a glass of milk for him.
The man had lived and died for his gold. He
would come into the bank, drenched, for he was
too mean to buy an umbrella. He was a remorse-
less enemy to himself, living the life of a starved,
hunted rat, and, with the exception of £5OO, he
has left all his property to the Church. R.I.P.

It was in a certain Maoriland city that
Louis Lohr thought to tighten the silken bonds
between church and stage by securing one of the
Cathedral chorister boys for Williamson’s Juvenile
Opera Company. Overtures were made to the
parents of the lad, and his sweet soprano was in a
fair way to quit the sanctuary for the footlights
when the Dean and Chapter came along and burst
up the ungodly project entirely. Lohr made a
feeble attempt to prove that a “ star ” juvenile
from the Cathedral would serve as a missionary
to the other youngsters, and would be able to open
rehearsal with a choice selection from the best
anthems. The Dean turned a deaf ear to this line
of argument, and the Bishop called down Heaven’s
wrath upon the unfortunate business-manager,
also upon everybody having authority over the
company, until they finally departed from the city
with a full treasury, but a firm determination to
look for no more talent behind an altar. The
dignified clergy brook no interference with any
chorister whose voice helps to fill the tabernacle
and is worth, perhaps, a tenner a week to thf
offertory.

A London magazine lately offered one
guinea for the best definition of “a good husband.”
The following won the prize :
One who is attentive without being exacting, lover-like
without being jealous, generous without being reckless,
proud without being vain, tender without being weak,
sensible without being cold, refined without being over-
fastidious, and man enough never to forget that lie
married with his eyes open, Such is a model husband.
We understand. It pans out thus : —Attentive to
requests without exacting reasons, consistently
uxorious, and too stupid to know a cicisbeo from
an ox; generous to the baby, by buying toys with
the pocket-money which reckless men spend in
tobacco ; proud of his wife, and not vain of him-
self ; tender enough husband, and strong enough
father, to hush and to carry the squawker at
midnight; sensible enough to perceive when
common-sense might chill, refined enough to
remark when the dinner is well done, and not
over-fastidious when there is nothing in the house;
and man enough to always play the part of the
fox who had lost his tail. Yes ! Alas, fo weary
man ! this is the model type.

THE JADE I LOVE.
(Song after Hamilton Aide.)
I love a jade with pencilled eye,
Who acts at the the-a-ter,
The gold that she is making fly
I wheedle from my mater ;
You would be shocked if you could twig
Her perched upon my knee ;
I'm twenty, but I’m none too big— .
She’s stout and forty-three.
I'm twenty, but I’m none too big—
She’s stout and forty-three.
She thinks me very young, I feel
She treats me like her poodle,
And when to kiss her hand I kneel
She merely murmurs “ noodle ! ”
I’ve bought the smartest horse and gig
Her faked-up eye could see ;
I’m twenty, but I’m none too big
She’s stout and forty-three.
( Repeat.)
X fear she is inconstant, too
That she has more admirers ;
She tells me tales that are not true,
For girls are such Sapphiras.
She doesn’t seem to care a fig
When I bring out a D. ;
I’m twenty, but I’m none too big—
She’s stout an’d forty-three.
(Repeat.)
And when my back is bent with age,
And I no more can tarry
To pick up charmers from the stage
(Ere then, of course, I’ll marry),
My whisky 1 shall calmly swig
That jade won’t worry me ;
I’ll buy her, though, a golden wig
The day she’s eighty-three—
Yes, Maud shall have a golden wig
The day she’s eighty-three.

The life of a railway lengthsman in Central
Queensland :—He has to walk the whole distance
of his length—the lengths vary from five to eight
miles—every morning before the first train, which
means.before breakfast, “ there and back, or from
10 to 16 miles, and examine carefully all the line,
especially dog-spikes, fish-plates, fences, and tele-
graph-poles and lines.” That done, he has to work
all day long in a broiling sun, or a pouring rain,
with a beater or shovel. At night he herds with
his family in a two-roomed kennel that lets in the
weather everyway. These kennels are 24ft. by
10ft., gross measurement, each room being not big
enough to gleefully swing a cat in ! Yet 10 to 11
persons—parents and children—have often to herd
m these disgraceful shanties. There are no out-
offices whatever. Yet the Q. Railway Commis-
sioners charge their wretched slaves 2s. fid. per

The imported Baldwin engines, like most

shoddy. They cost as much as engines locally

away great chunks of the premises, tlmy are too
heavy for the wheels, their parts are a wonderful
series of misfits, and they seldom get to the end
of a journey without breaking down miserably.
Baldwin is a good many thousand miles away,
however, so that no one can sue him for damages
with much show of success, and the country must
put up with the job as best it can.
An artist agreed to paint the picture of a
saint for the refectory-wall of a convent, at a
rniserab'y low price, provided that his meals were
given him during the work. The only food the
convent supplied was bread, onions, and water.
The artist said nothing, but proceeded serenely
with tiie wo k. At last came the ceremony of
publicly unveiling the picture. In the presence of
the holy friars the artist removed the curtain, and
revealed —a first-class back-view of the saint.
“ What does this mean?” indignantly demanded
the prior. “Father,” said the artist, meekly, “ I
had to paint him this way, because the saint
couldn’t bear the smell of onions.”
Eighteen times in the course of last month
the Sydney Echo got in a rage and wanted to say
something dreadfully severe about Tins Bulletin,
and each time it had to relieve its feelings by
calling it “a weakly paper.” It was the only
humorous and crushing observation the Echo
could find ; in all that huge building there is only
one joke, and it isn’t up to much, and into the
bargain it is borrowed. The Bulletin invented
that joke years ago, and gave it up because it
seemed an inferior article, and now its own left-
off observation keeps turning up again like an old
sin that won’t be bmied. Be sure your joke will
find you out. When you give up using it your-
self someone else will come and tell it to you. By
the way, what’s the matter with “the weakly

The pale-faced Cockney who doesn’t pin
his faith to one particular London journal and
derive all his “ facts ” from the same source,
must, by this time, have formed some kind of
opinion of his own concerning the influence of The
Bulletin. In the Fortnightly Review he finds
it treated as the weekly Bible of Young Australia,
and in the Contemporary Review he sees it
summed up, by Crusty Murray, as “ the most
mischievous paper in the world.” Anon he rubs
his eyes after staring at the vermilion lie of
Parson Fitchett, printed by the Pall Mall
Gazette, that the apocryphal “great ivecklies,
taken together, have 500 readers where The Bul-
letin has one,” after which an ex-Mayor of Ade-
laide (James Shaw) tells him, in St. James’
Budget, “it is perfectly true that The Bulletin
is a paper which is widfly read.” Then the
Cockney, putting two and two together, and
having read Stead to the effect that The Bulletin
is “a clever, wicked paper,” begins to strike a
vague idea of the situation for himself, and
arrives, in the first instance, at an inevitable con-
clusion that Fitchett is booked for the wrath to
come. Murray and the ex-Mayor person, both
being loaded up with reverence for the Royal
Family as an institution, are naturally maligners
of The Bulletin, but not having entered into
holy orders, they seem to entertain conscientious
scruples about libelling its circulation.

Young Alexander of Servia— aged 1!) or so —went

Milan had just stepped out to drink with another

There is a whole lot of humour about the
unchartered bank, especially when it bursts, and
all the facts come out. Probably the most
amusing institution of the lot is the Federal
Reversionary I. and F. Co. This distracted com-
pany held a meeting last Saturday to define its
position, and explain where the cash had gone,
and why it went there, and the manager, Mr.
Miller, told a tearful story, from which it
appeared that he had had much heavy digging to
do. Certain old-time directors had power to
draw cheques without his signature, and when-
ever they wanted money they simply drew a
cheque accordingly. Then the manager had to
serve on a jury, and while he was away the
directors rushed the office, and carried off £250.
When he came back the board turned up again,
meaning to carry off the rest of the cash, but Mr.
Miller told them they would have to climb over
his dead body to get at the safe. Further, he
tore off his coat and cast himself into the breach,
and “ stoushed ” the board so hard in the eye
that it fled without the money. They got a new
lot of directors after that, but apparently the old
board with the ruined optic never settled up.

Now and Then.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now we see a mortal tremble, cringe and stoop to
brother man ;
Now we see the little children, thin and pinched,
and white and wan ;
Noiv we see thin, careworn women, see their
stunted bodies small,
See them nurse their sickly babies, who will work
when they can crawl;
Now arise up all around us hellish sights which
meet our gaze—
Sights which though noiv lightly looked at will be
loathed in later days :
Of the worker slaving, toiling, from the morn
until the night;
Delving in dark, filthy caverns when God’s sun
gives out its light;
Tasting air but grudging given, while allround
him seems to teethe—
Air, which flows as free as heaven, not for one,
but all to breathe ;
Slaving on through calm and tempest, slaving on
in .earth and sea ;
Never thinking, never striving for the time that is
to be—
He has got no time for thinking how the world
might be made gay.
Only his the time for thinking how to keep the
wolf away—
Slaving where the fire burns fiercest, where the
cold is felt indeed ;
Slaving ever, ever, ever, slaving for another’s
greed.
Now we see those sights around us : misery which
fattens lust;
They the products of a system which must crumble
into dust.
And the true man’s face grows weary thinking of
his fellow men—
Thinking how they toil in day-time, how they
rest in loathsome den :
Such a contrast lo the beauty o! the times that
will be —then !
Then shall all mankind stand upright—stand so
brave, and fair, and free ;
Then shall children, starved no longer, play and
laugh iu merry glee ;
Then shall happy wives and mothers wish no more
that they were dead,
Fight no more life’s dreary battle, live a life of
peace instead ;
Then shall rise up all around us, sights—when
greed and shame depart
Glorious sights, in which no longer stone usurps
the place of heart :
Of all mankind’s chances equal : equal chance of
head or hand,
When each man shall be a free man, slave to none
throughout the land.
Of the rapine and the murder which has shrieking
flown away —
The same rapine, the same murder which are
everywhere to-day ;
Of the earth which is a heaven : and the filthy,
loathsome hell
Which is now this woild of sorrow, and in which
the workers dwell,
Is fur ever lost and vanished, and which, like a
fearsome dream
From the memory once banished, flies, and never
more is seen;
Then we’ll see these sights around us : wealth no
more from squalor wrung ;
Then we’ll know that from our sj'stem, fair and
bright the New has sprung.
And the true man’s eyes grow radiant when this
world of grief is gone
And this earth becomes a heaven for the gods to
dwell upon.

The universal popularity of Ayer’s Hair Vigor
is the most convincing proof of its value as a
Pressing for the Hair.
■When the hair becomes thin, faded, or pre-
maturely gray, this preparation restores all its
former color, fullness, and texture. Bland, cool,
and delightfully perfumed, Ayer’s Hair Vigor
prevents baldness, keeps the head free from
dandruff, and cures unsightly and troublesome
humors of the scalp. Ladies desirous of having
an abundance of soft, silky tresses, and gentle-
men who wish to preserve their youthful ap-
pearance to an advanced age, would do well to
furnish their toilets with

The Duke of Gampridge has had the royal
German effrontery to tell a body of Scotch troops —
“ You are fit to do anything—l remember you
serving under me in the Crimean War.” He
didn't remember them scooting back to Hingland
with bogus wounds in their little toes, though.
All the active serving worth mention that fat,
gorgy Georgcy ever did was at the mess dinner-
table. Then lie served himself to 15 sorts of
dessert.
Some little time ago a man named Craven
was arrested in Wellington (M.L.) for stealing an
overcoat from a nail in a public-house. He got
one month, and when he was released from gaol
after working out his sentence, he bolted straight
for the same hotel, and stole the same overcoat a
second time from the same identical nail. This
time he got six mouths. And when lie finishes
the six months, the chances seem about even that
the first thing he will do will be to make a bee-
line for the same pub and steal the same old coat
for the third time. Then he’ll get 12 months, and
after that we trust the coat will be worn out.
THE VERY BEST .
A single pain is often the first indication, and
the last throe, in one, of a physical climax, and
the climax is death. That St. Jacobs Oil has
again and again wrought its miracles just in the
nick of time, has bridged over the critical
emergency, and has
SAVED MANY LIVES
at the point of death, is fully attested by the
record of many extraordinary cures in which this
fact of saving life is duly set forth.
If to its remarkable virtues in the permanent
cure of chronic cases of Rheumatism, Neuralgia,
Lumbago, Sciatica, after years of endurance,
wherein everything else proved valueless, fortunes
were spent in vain, and crutches and crippled
limbs were the manifestations, is to be added its
supreme sovereignty over pain, even unto death,
it is wholly entitled to the appellation of
THE VERY BEST.
Its specific action is especially adapted with a
curative penetration and soothing effect to arrest
any pain at the acme of its worst influence.
A MOST REMARKABLE CASE
can be cited in proof, which is thoroughly verified.
It is in its main features taken from a leading
Liverpool journal as follows: “Two years ago,”
states Mr. William Buchanan, residing at No. 8,
St. John’s-road, Kirkdale, Liverpool, and twenty-
four years in the service of the Cunard Steamship
Co., “ I was taken down with a most excruciat-
ing pain in my head, which was followed by
ONE YEAR OF TORTURE.
All physicians believed that it would lead to
softening of the brain and death. Six of the most
eminent attended me ; but gave no relief. I had
to be held down, and my screams were heard out-
side, My case was deemed incurable. My wife
procured a bottle of St. Jacobs Oil, and applied it
to my head. It acted like magic. I was cured
by it, and am now in perfect health, and I have
not had the slightest return since I was cured
some months ago.” Nothing more need be added.

PROGRESS IN CIVILISATION.
Nature never makes a mistake. Whatever
material is at hand is turned to the best use.
Man, the creation of Nature, follows in her foot-
steps, and steadily seeks a higher plane by re-
jecting the less worthy, and selecting that at his
command which is the most practical. This
progress in civilisation is marked in all details of
life, and particularly in the different apparatus or
mechanical contrivances for every day con-
tingencies. One by one the less fitting drop out,
or are literally crowded aside by those offering
superior advantages. Steam has superseded sail.
The old time horological contrivances are pushed
to the rear by the newer, less costly, and more
reliable appliances of to-day. To-day the public
demand economy, combined with quality,
honesty, and accuracy, and i n all these particulars
the Waterbury watches “ fill the bill,” and there-
by have gained respect and admiration in every
quarter of the earth as honest, reliable, and faith-
ful timekeepers, produced at as low a cost as is
compatible with good material, skilful-workman-
ship, and their undoubtedly excellent qualifi-
cations.

SPORTING NOTIONS.
The latest method of getting the straight tip is
divination by hens. The process is very simple. Get a
Jot of eggs, and mark them with the names of the various
liorses in the Melbourne Cup. Then seize upon the
rooster’s wife and put her on top of them, and wait
results. When the first Ih e chicken comes out, read the
name on the broken shell, and lay your Hide and your
hones on the animal right off. This is as good a way as
any other. The orthodox style, of course, is to have a
seedy-looking tout walk softly in and breathe the name
of a certain horse and a horrid aroma of beer and onions
into your ear, and charge you half-a-orown, hut by the
hen-dodge you get there just the same. Also, you en-
courage a deserving and industrious bird at the same
time, and the fowl knows as much about horse-racing as
you do, anyhow.

A tote-promoter, of King-street, Sydney, sloped
after the Cup. He was hit for the double to the tune of
i!200, but the savant who had invested a shilling with
such splendid results found nothing hut a few empty
cigar-boxes awaiting him when he called at the appointed
hour to receive the ’oof.

Grace had a great reception in Adelaide. The
voyage has added a few stone to his weight, and lie will
have to train down considerably. He is lucky in com-
mencing on the billiard-table wickets of Adelaide.

George Giffen is in his very best batting form
this year. His marvellous innings against Victoria proves
it. What price a batsman who makes 271, and then takes
the ball and gets 16 wickets for 172 runs in the two
innings, seven of them clean bowled on a splendid wicket?

Captain Tom Merry has a most interesting
little yarn in the Breeder and Sportsman as to how our
Robinson Crusoe gained his name. According to the
Captain’s yarn, the two-year-old colt by Angler from the
imported Chrysolite was on the City of Melbourne when
she foundered off Coogee in the year 1875, and of the 70
passengers, crew, and some 30 horses, the Chrysolite colt
was the only living thing to reach Coogee beach, when he
was assisted on to dry land by a couple of fishermen, was
appropriately christened Robinson Crusoe, Carried off the
A. J.C. Derby and St. Leger, and when his racing days
were over, begot such animals as Navigator, Trident, and
Sedition to add to his fame. There are one or two little
items in the yarn that are not quite gospel. For instance,
the City of Melbourne is riding at anchor in one of the
hays at Port Jackson at the present time. Joe Thompson,
one of the passengers whom Captain Merry sent to per-
dition off Coogee in ’75, is very much alive in England,
and Robinson Crusoe did wot swim ashore, but was landed
from the City of Melbourne at the old A.S.N. Co.’s wharf
more dead than alive and carted through the Sydney
streets on a trolly. Slight discrepancies of this descrip-
tion don’t count for much in America, however, and tHe
Yanks will enjoy the well-written yarn just as much as if
it were gospel.

English County cricket does not favour the

Mr. Prince; so well-known as a student of the

Wollongong (N.S.W.) coach, when one of the passengers
would not give anyone else a chance to get a word in
edgeways. Daddy Hillewell, the basso, was sitting next
to Prince and asked that walking stud-book if be knew
whom the gentleman with the jaw was. “ Ob, yes,” was
the reply, “he is by Talk o’ the Hills, out of Gossip,
named Loquacity.” A bit-further on “ Dad ” commenced
to hum, in his deepest notes,vibe Shakespearian refrain of
“ Who is Sylvia, what is she?” when to his disgust Mr.
Prince gave him in extenso the tabulated pedigree of
Martini-Henry’s famous dam.

The second meeting between Dawson and

Amateur Gymnastic Club rooms, may not prove such a

knows the rushing style of Williams’ fighting, and must
be aware that the Victorian will not stand off to he
pinked by his scientific left. Dawson’s only chance of
victory is to “ mix it” with his opponent, and then it
remains as to who gets in the first lucky jawbreaker. It
is certainly rather a forlorn hope for a man like Dawson
to change his style of fighting, but it is his only chance.

Some Maoriland gluttons are growling because,
during the last five years, Pakehawhaws (copyright) ! ave
sent £26,000 to Sydney turf consultations on the -Mel-
bourne Cup, and have “ only ” received, in prizes, £3700.
Only? Why, over 14 per cent, is a rattling good average
when the tremendous odds necessarily involved in a big
consultation are considered. Thus, only one ticket in
one hundred thousand can pull off the biggest prize in
the (as yet) biggest sweep. Suppose an immortal took
one £1 ticket every year, in a £lOO,OOO sweep, for 100,000
years, he would not even then have readied “level odds ”
for his chance for the first prize of £27,000 (deducting
£3OOO as commission), though he might in the meantime
have pulled off a few minor prizes that made his average
good ; on the other hand, he might have pul'ed off none
at all. Leaving out questions of inti rest on money, his
totalled chances would not ha Lvel, though he would
have raked the run of the serins, tor each frash sweep
renews the odds at the same disadvantage, and because a
man lost last year is no reason why his this year’s shew
is better than 99,909 to 1 ; or, because he won last year,
is no ground tor calculating his chances as worse this
year. Taking interest into consideration in this fancy
problem—£l at s.per cent, compound interest for 100,CCD
years; £2 for 99,999 years; £3 for 99,998 ytars, &c., the
lightning-actuary finds that the gambling-immortal
would have to li\e 100,000 years and spend something
like, 0,985,621,729,731,218 .billions of billions of pounds
sterling, in order to get a square chance of winning
£27,000, with the very open possibility througheut if
winning nothing at all. Add to this, 100,000 post a e-
staraps, and 100,000 registration fees, and 109,000
envelopes, &c., and the interest on the cost thereof, it
is seen at a glance that the grunting Maoiilauders, who
have scooped in over 11 per cent, of prizes, are twisting
good luck into a grievance. The chances rf winning any
named prize—even the lowest - in a £lOO,OOO sweep is
always 99,999 to 1; and the chance of winning one out of
(say) 1(0 prizes, big Or little, is 999 to 1.

WHAT CURES PIMPLES
a i
The only really successful prevent-
ive and cure of pimples, blotches,
blackheads, red, rough, and oily skin,
and most complexional disfigurations,
is that greatest of all Skin Purifiers
and Beautifiers, the celebrated Cuxi-
cura Soap. For irritating and scaly
humors of the scalp, with dry or fall-
ing hair, red, rough hands, chaps,
painful finger ends with shapeless
nails, and simple humors of the skin
and scalp of infancy and childhood, it
is simply infallible.
CUTICURA SOAP
A marvellous bcautifier of world-wide celebrity, Cuticura Soap is simply incom-
parable as a Skin-Purifying Soap, unequalled for the Toilet, and without a rival for
the Nursery. Absolutely pure, delicately medicated, exquisitely perfumed, it produces
the whitest, clearest skin, and softest hands, and prevents inflammation and clogging
of the pores, the cause of pimples, blotches, blackheads, red and oily skin, and most
complexional disfigurations. It derives its remarkable medicinal properties from
Cuticura, the great skin cure, but so delicately are they blended with the purest of
toilet and nursery soap stocks that the result is a medicated toilet soap incomparably
superior to all other skin and complexion soaps, while rivalling in delicacy and sur-
passing in purity the most noted and expensive of toilet and nursery soaps. For the
prevention of facial blemishes, for giving a brilliancy and freshness to the com-
plexion, and for cleansing the scalp and invigorating the hair, it is without a peer.

Love’s Tontine.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Most love stories have a Mabel, or a Maud, or
Gladys, or Claribel. This one has none of these,
only plain Jeannio Thomson. Not Jinny nor
Jenny, and hardly Thomson ; if trutli is wanted,
she called herself Jeannie Tainsin. She is Scotch.
The heroes, and one was a hero, are not Cyrils,
Cecils, Aubreys, Randolphs, or Mortimers. One
was Jock M’Leish, the other is Wull Scobie.
They were all Scotch, and few Scotchmen are
heroes. lam privileged to say this. I myself am
a Scotchman.
It was Whyte Melville who told the lady that
the extraordinary thing about his most improb-
able and perfectly impossible novel, was that every
word was true. I don’t say my story is true ; but
it is very near it. I don’t like to write it. It is
too horrible, and yet it is not so ghastly as a stab
in the dark or a cowardly murder. It is ghastly
because it is unique. The face of Jock M'Leish
appears when I misshape one of my capitals ;
when a spot of ink falls on the white paper
and spreads into fantasy, when the lamp-
shadow flickers, when the cat mews, when
a coal topples out of the fire; for Jock was
one of my friends, and when I look back I might
have guessed Ids end—but—nothing could turn
M’Leish from an intended line of action.
The story is short. Jock and Wull were fencing
on a small place near llughendeu, Queensland.
There was a new-chum cook, called Jean Thom-
son, and the fencers were allowed to have supper
and breakfast in the kitchen. Jeannie was fair to
sec : one of those healthy Scotch women who come
from about the Ochels, and everyone took a fancy
to her. Both of ourlfencers fell in love with her.
Womanlike, she only fell in love with one of
them, and that was Scobie.
M’Leish was always a morose man ; he did not
drink after the first or second gla-s, but he gam-
bled. He would bet on anything, and ids last two
or three investments were curious and profitable,
but not to him.
The pair of them had a ticket in a sweep, and
drew “Pistol.” We all knew how Pistol won,
but few thought that Scobie and McLeish had
realized T9OO. They never changed their style of
life; but they had only T3OO a-piece, because
they had promised Jeannie a share in the ticket.
Now, the ticket was in John McLeish's name,
and the confidence of the other two was such that
the money was lodged in the bank also entirely in
his name. He said he saw how things were, and
that when the fence was finished he’d settle up
and go away. The other two knew he was deep
gone on the woman. Just about then an insur-
ance-agent came round canvassing for a great
Yankee company. We knew this agent —yellow
face, black teeth, smooth, badly-fitting broadcloth
clothes, dirty nails, and a hideous grin. So he
canvassed for Jock’s life, explaining that if he
were to be shot, or die to morrow, he’d get TICOO,
on payment of £22 yearly. Then Jock asked if
suicides got paid, “Yes, certainly, that’s a
special item in our policies.” He also assured
him that the payments were prompt, and they
went into town, where Jock got a policy for
Til 000, and a guarantee from the local bank-
manager that the affair was square.
Now, in the town of Bungancock, there was, as
in every other country place, a billiard-sharp and
bookie. You can tell them by their unhealthy
pallor and bald head ; also by their diamond ring,
beastly grammar, and profuse obscenity. This
one was a man of “stuff”: he found backers
when he made a big bet and was once known to
own three legs of a horse and to take a contract
wool-washing. Well, he met Jack, and asked him
his business in Bungancork. Life - insurance.
What on earth are you wasting money on that
for ? “ Well,” said jack, “ I believe Will Scobie
will be the means of my death within six months
—at least I’ll take odds about it.”
“ Tell you what I’ll do,” said Spieler-Baldy—
“ I’ll lay you 5 to 1 you don’t die within six months
through the agency, direct or indirect, of William
Scobie.”
“Well, done,” said Jack —“come over to the
bank and post the money.”
If you think of it, this was a real good bet for
the Bald-spieler; and he had a hundred or two
to spare. The manager was induced to place to a
separate account T 250 of Baldy’s money, and £5O
of Jock's. The sum being payable to the order of
both, which was given in a sealed envelope, and
stated the contingency on which it depended.
Then Jock went back to complete his fence.
About a week before the last strainer was put
up he went into town and made his will, and left
it with the local drunkard —I mean, solicitor.
Then came the end of the fence and the end of
Jock. Wull was straining the last wire and talk-
ing to the overseer. Jock was at the further end
and could not be seen for thistles. The wire gave
and gave to the Spanish windlass. Both the over-
seer and Scobie remarked that it took a lot of
turns. So they slacked it and took a new pur-
chase. All right now ; the wire keyed and cut;
the fence is finished ; but where is Jock? “Coo-ee.”
Not an answer ! Then they strolled down to the
next straining-post among the thistles. Crows
have begun to collect. On one side of the fence is
Jock’s head, and on the other side his trunk : cut
asunder by the wire—clean decapitation and to
tiiis day no one can swear how his head got into
the bight of the wire.
But Jeannie is Mrs. Scobie, and the will left
everything to Wull and Jeannie conjointly; and
the Spieler repudiated the bet, but finally paid
by order on the banker : and the insurance-agent,
with tobacco-juice on his lips and mud in his nails,
advised his company to contest it. But being a
new affair, on the contrary it used Jock’s suicide
as an advertisement.
There is a sadness about a homestead lease in
West Queensland ; not engendered by the
natures of the master and mistress, but caused by
the extraordinary way in which the place was
acquired. It is called Tontine Plains.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Where mighty forest giants rear up, dense, dark,
Their tangled growths to Heaven and make of (ierce
Red summer spring and winter autumn's shades ;
Where from huge mountains, mighty bosoms of
The earth, a thousand sounding waters start
To life and loveliness, and vie in song
With gay-winged birds that sing the whole year round ;
Where, in a word, the forms of earthly things
Are likest to the fabled splendours of
The new-born world his home was, his whom men
Called father, holy one, and reverenced with
Uncovered head. But, oh, how unearned all
This praise ! Three score of years and two had he
Dwelt in this solitude—since manhood’s down
First clothed his cheeks till age his tresses long
And flowing beard had whitened—lived the life
Of man unworthy. Thrice in that long life
Of his th’ invaders trode his native shore,
And steeped in blood the land that gave him birth ;
Yet never raised the hand nor voice in her
Defence, but in his wretched sloth slept on.
Once Famine stalked, a horrid thing, athwart
The land, and he, whom men named holy, raised,
His own wants satisfied, his impious voice
To Heaven and thanked great God the sins of men
Were punished. Such this good man's deeds and of
Like nature all Ids life’s events ; yet, when
He died the monument was wanting not
That told, in carven characters of gold,
The pure and God-like life he led.
But lived
A man, the noblest he of all his race,
Whose highest aim below to follow in
His Master’s, Saviour's, ways was ; city’s slums
He lived and worked in ; nothing for himself
Stored up, but worked from morn till evening for
The good of fellow-men. The criminal
He called his brother ; fallen women of
The streets as sisters loved and cherished—
And all with this reward, that he by those
Whose lives were passed in ease, was spurned and classed
Amongst those fall’n he set himself to raise.
O, what a world of wrongs is this ! Oft has’t
Been said that were the Christ of Nazareth
To come again amongst the men of earth
He would again be wronged to death. And so
It w-as of whom I sing. When sickness bowed
His noble head no comfort was for him,
Nor aid, whose life was spent for all. And so
All unattended passed his spirit away,
Whose life was blessed with deeds of good ; yet none
For him raised up the sculptured tomb to tell
His virtues manifold.
O, say, who should,
Of these two, live forever in the praise
Of men—the one whose life was spent in deeds
Of good, or th’ hermit in his forest-cell?
Yet, not alone in sheltered forest is
The hermit found, but in the roar of cold
Cruel cities. '

No. XIV.-For His Child’s Pleasure.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
The judgments of early Australian his-
torians (not to say anything as to some later ones)
are seldom to be impugned on the ground that
they are too partial to tbo Powers that Were, but
we must arraign for this crime against historic
truth no less an author than Joseph Holt, some-
time “General” of Irish rebels, and afterwards
“ political transport ” to Botany Bay. When
Holt contented himself with placing Lieutenant-
Colonel Foveaux (at sundry dates and in various
“colonies” representative of Kingly Authority,
and presumably, therefore, instinct with regal
qualities of heart and brain) on a pedestal of
infamy, he misled posterity. He pa'nted Foveaux
as a villain merely. Instead, he should have
pourtrayed him as a monster.
There is a story to the effect that John Mao-
arthur once refused to take Eoveaux’s hand till ho
(the Colonel) had exonerated himself from some
allegation or other —what, has not been recorded,
save that it affected his personal honour. Now,
when Macarthur could repulse his former friend
and tool in that way, imagine, if you can,
Eoveaux’s character.
A pedestal of shame only for the Colonel !
Tush ! He should have had a Bolgia of Dante’s
Hell £.ll to himself !
For he was not merely a wronger of women and
a tyrant of men, a betrayer of his equals’ confi-
dence and a defiler of his inferiors’ homes. Other
gentlemen of Old Sydney shared these distinctions
with him, and there was nothing unique in his
life when tested in relation to these points. His
infamous pre-eminence has its origin in these
facts :
He was the introducer of branding-irons ;
He was a flogger of women ; and
He was a hanger of men without legal form of
accusation or trial.
The tale we tell to-day was not of the first occa-
sion on which Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting-
Governor Foveaux dislocated a man’s neck without
taking the trouble to put in operation the for-
malities British Justice thought necessary when
it desired to complete its work of handing a tran-
sport over to the Devil,
Not the first—by three. That is, as far as our
information goes. At the same time, we are pre-
( jared to concede the possibility that it may not
lave been the first by 13 or 30, as-likely as by
three. Foveaux did not belong to that class of
humorists who exhaust their fancy by a three-fold
repetition of one joke.
# # #
The Colonel was Acting-Governor. It was
during the Interregnum caused by the Rum
Puncheon Rebellion the time which .John
Macarthur aforesaid, was fond of alluding to as
the period of the Commonwealth. And the
Governor ruled in State at Gbvernmint House,
Parramatta.
The beauty of September was on the scene—
the sweet hush, advent-sign of the new spring,
was in the air—the .wattles were becoming
languorous with perfume and colour —the ducks
on the lagoon were bold among the rushes-- aud
His Excellency snored on the verandah, with a
gaily-hued silk-handkerchief covering his face as
he slept recumbent on a “ currency ’’-lounge.*
The cares of .State evidently had lain heavy on
the Governor's mind thus to cause fatigue in the
early afternoon. The caresof .State or, possibly,
the after-effects ’ of the over - night debauch.
Bacchus (to be silent as to Venus) was worshipped
ardently at Government House in Commonwealth
days, and though fine wines were not easily pro-
curable even by gentlemen having access to the
Colonial Treasury, still Bengal rum was cheap.
It was not always an Excellency for the time being
who could afford to consider the refinements of
the palate when weighed against the pocket.
The sentry, a dozen yards away, paced as care-
fully as he could. Nevertheless, a pebble would
sometimes slip under his foot, and he would slide
or stumble,.and already the Governor had stirred
uneasily once or twice. By regulating his steps
and watching where his feet went, the soldier, one
of the historic N.S.W. Corps, hoped tosootheand
not to irritate the great man’s slumber. It was
touching, this solicitude not to disturb His Excel-
lency—but it is open to doubt whether the anxiety
was to preserve his own immunity from punish-
ment, or for the Colonel’s repose.
Ten paces to the right of his box —ten back;
ten thence to the left—ten back ; that was the
sentry’s “ go.” And he thought that what with
measuring his steps, and the fear of disturbing
the Governor, he himself would be in no danger
of falling asleep like that unfortunate sentinel in
Sydney, who a week or two previously had dozed
as he walked, and thus neglecting to receive
Colonel Foveaux with a due salute, had been
cautioned against any future drowsiness by one
thousand lashes.
The balsamic air and the out-pourings from the
cornucopia of sunlight, the monotony of his duty,
and the vacuity of his mind, however, conspired
against the soldier’s wakefulness. His walk
became more mechanical, and his eyes half-closed;
then closed wholly, during one twenty-pace walk;
opened for one second, while he, by force of habit,
turned on the pivot of his heel and retraced his
steps—then closed once more.
He walked so for a few minutes, to all practical
purposes, asleep. He turned at the right-about
spot, machine-like, but, notwithstanding, it was
the case of the Sydney sentry over again.
Even to the thousand lashes, it was the same
case.
* « «
He must have been asleep, else he would
have heard the boisterous accents of a man coming
up the ascent from the park-gates—past the ruins
of the first Rosehill cottages. 'The fellow
was gay to the Verge of indecorum, for he now
waved his cabbage-tree hat in the air, and now
flapped it against his sides, in sheer recklessness
of movement, while lie poured forth, in tuneless
volume, one of the “ flash ” songs which were as
popular among the lower-class “ free ” as among
the transports for whose edification they had been
originally composed.
If the voice was unmelodious the spirit was
joyous, and the words were by “flash” standard,
choice : //
Come, Bet, my pet,' and Sal, my pal, a buss and then
farewell;
And, Ned, the primest ruffing cove that ever nail’d a
swell— , . -
To shaije the swag, or chaff the gab, we'll never meet
again, •
The hulks is now my browsing crib, the hold my dossing
ken.
“The hold my doss—my doss-ing—k-ken !” echoed
bravely. Admirable was the attempt to impart
expression, and to appropriately convey the
heroic sentiment which the poet—no doubt one of
Jemmy Catnach’s high-quality hacks—had put
into the mouth of an embryo colonist. Had the
singer been aware that he had for audience the
distinguished head of the colony himself, he could
not have sung in a more encore-provoking fashion.
Perhaps, indeed, he would not have trolled forth
so heartily. The proximity of Governor Eoveaux’s
person was not a circumstance calculated to
encourage warmth of feelings of a pleas-
ing kind—especially when the Colonel had
been suddenly roused by undignified sounds
and had perceived in the first opening of
his own eyelids that the sentry’s were stupified by
somnolence though he was moving in his pen-
dulum-swing.
Without rising from the lounge, the Governor
roared : “ Halt! ”
The sentry was startled into wakefulness —and
an indiscretion. He turned and faced the veran-
dah, lifting in the same instant Ins disengaged
hand to his eyes as though to rub them. No
clearer admission could anyone desire than that
he had been overcome by drowsiness.
“Asleep on your post! By ,my man ”
given somewhat to forcible speech was his Excel-
lency—“ you haven’t learnt anything from that
last week’s flogging ! And who are you, you fellow?
How dare you, sir, come here ? ”
The question was addressed to the singer who,
still chanting his verse—
Don’t nab the bib, my Bet, this chance must happen soon
or later,
For certain sure am I that transportation comes by natur ;
His Lordship’s self, upon the Bench, so downey his white
w ig in
Might sail with me, if friends had he to bring him up to
' priggin’—
had come into sight through the hedge which
divided the house-garden—Governor Phillips’s
“crescent” —from the park-land.
“ To prig-gin’— to prig-gin’ ” —he dwelt impres-
sively on the final notes, and was not very much
surprised when the Governor, on hearing whose
voice he had, of course, paused in his song as well
as in his walk, ordered him to “sing that over
again.” No vocalist yet was ever surprised at
a request for an encore.
“Go on! That’s not the end, is it?” the
Representative of Royalty was pleased to say as
the possibility of his Lordship’s fate had his early
training been different was once more musically
expressed. And, the singer having first saluted
he knew his manners, and as a veteran of the Old
Corps, of course, he showid respect in the manner
of his former profession—favoured his laughing
Excellency, and the trembling sentry, and the
stupefied sergeant and man of the guard with the
last stave ;
And is it not inkimmon fly on them as rules the nation,
To make us end with Botany, our public edication ?
But Sal, so kind, be sure you find, the beaks don’t catch
you trippin’,
You’ll find it hard to be for shoppm’ sent on board th
shippin’!
“Sent on bo-oard th’ shippin’—th’ shippin’.”
“ Bravo ! Bravo ! ” His Excellency applauded
heartily. “ Well sung ! But isn’t there a chorus?”
“ Oh, yes, y’r Honor! I was a-forgettin’ th’
chorus. I'll tip it yer, sir.”
And with a twirl of his cabbage-tree, he shouted
-—“Chorus”—
So tip your manns, afore we part, don’t blear your eyes
and uose-es, ...
Another grip, my jolly hearts -here’s luck, and on wi
goes-es!
‘‘Good, again!’’ The Governor was genuinely
affable in his appreciation of the vocal artist.
“And ’tis quite true— ’tis a case of ‘Off wo
gocs-es.’ Sergeant, lock-up that drunken fellow
for creating a disturbance in Government 1 louse
grounds, and yon sentry for permitting him and
for being asleep on his post ! By ——, I’ll make
an example of both of ’em, disturbing me this
way. Off with 'em both to the guard-room !’
The sentry made no resistance; he was dis-
armed and led awty passively, for he had come
to a realisation of tne fata that was in store for
him, and had resolved to meet it valiantly. The
man of the Sydney Company had not .cried out
chop during the terrible inttic ion of his thousand,
and if lie could help it he would not during his
lot.
With the singer, however, the case was different.
Although he was an ex-soldier, he was smitten
with tire desperation of fear. Variously, Foveaux
was termed by'the men of - the Corps, “Bloody
Toveaux ” and “Tiger Toveaux,” and each appella-
tion was a testimony to the almost insatiable
bloodthirstiness of the officer when his appetite
had once been whetted by tasting the droppings
of the scourger’s cats. This is a figure of speech
which yet is not a figure merely. The meaning
hereof may be told some day.
The singer, paid out of the Corps these five
years, had not forgotten the Colonel’s reputation,
and ho had rejoiced in his heart that the great
man was in so pleasant a mood that day, as evi-
denced by his desire to hear the conclusion of the
song, for it augured well, he had thought, for the
granting of the request he had come all the way
from Sydney to prefer to his Excellency—which
was that his “right tooceupy” might be made into
a grant—so that he could sell his land. Now, the
re-action of feeling shocked him out of his manli-
ness, and he cringed before the Acting-Governor.
“Oh, y’r Honor, not me, sir! I ain’t dun
enythink, y’r Excellency. An’ his true I’ve had
a ball+ of rum, sir, but I ain't in no manner of
bein’ drunk, sir !”
“ To the guard-room, sergeant !”
“ No, y’r Excellency, surely not!” the poor
sinner, sickened by his extremity, pleaded. “Not
without a-hearin’ of me, sir, an’ why I’m here.
I’m hero with a letter, sir, from the Secretary,
y’r Excellency, Secretary Blaxall ’tis urgent,
y’r Honor!’’
“What does he say ?” demanded the magnani-
mous Head of the State. “He has a letter ? ’
“Yes, y'r Honor—y’r Excellency, I mean, sir.”
“Unhand him, sergeant, till he gives you the
letter!” -- '
Treed from the clutch of the guard for n minute,
the wretched offender against the vice-regal
dignity pulled from the folds of his dungaree shirt
a folded and scaled packet.
“This is it, y’r Excellency—from Carnham
Blaxall, Es-quire, Acting-Colonial Secretary. Tis
in support, sir, of my application.’’ His craven-
heartedness was gradually going away before the
rush of returning hope,
“ Pass me the letter, sergeant—the man’s appli-
cation can wait till I hear his case to-morrow.”
Back into its terrors went the poor worm on
whom Authority had placed its righteous heel.
“ Oh, no, y’r Excellency; now please—hear me !
To-morrow’ll be too late !”
“Too late! Too late ! Are you Governor, or
am I?” shouted his Excellency. “ Too late! By
, ’tis never too late to refuse an application !
Your application is refused ! Off with him, ser-
geant, I say.” - „

“Oh, y’r Excellency—don’t say that—.” He
wrested himself from the grasp of the privates
who had held him, and rushed towards the Gover-
nor, who was standing just at the head of the
steps leading to the piazza. Eoveaux, the arrant
coward that he was, started back a couple of paces.
j,ike most tyrants, he was in constant morbid
fear of personal attacks, and, indeed, it is a won-
der that no more than nine or ten assaults upon
his scoundrel’s body are recorded.
On this occasion, however, his alarm was need-
less. The man stopped, respectfully enough, at
the foot of the steps to plead his cause.
“ Look, y’r Excellency—l’m due for my grant a
year ago —if I had it now I could sell it and get
home— there’s a ship sails next week—the first for
two months—and I want to get home by her, me
and my wife—we must be in Lunnun on a certain
day, or else I lose a pot o’ money, y’r Excellency—
ancl the notice of goin’ away X can then be published
in the paper on Sunday, if I get y’r Honor's, y’r
Excellency's, grant to-day !”
Once more tlie blasphemous oath fell from Vice-
regal lips, ,
“By G- —sergeant! I’ve a mind to tickle
you and your men for permitting this blackguard
to break arrest.”
Urged by this remonstrance, the guard rusned
forward—the sergeant, the corporal, and three
men. There Was a struggle, a mighty struggle,
John Lea, ex-member of the New South Wales
Corps, understood now that he Was fighting fot
What Was more to him then than life—his freedom.
Re threw the sergeant on his back, and tripped
the corporal so neatly that he fell upon his pros-
trate brothet-non.-com. The privates bad held
back for a second to enable their officers to get a
grip Upon the man, but now they, too, propelled
themselves upon him. Before, however, they could
beat him down, he had retreated up the steps, the
path to the gate being closed by his assailants;
Tlie men followed him. The foremost went down
mucker than he came up, and in his descent
received oh his forehead a gash from the kerb of
the lowest step. The others were more successful —
they clenched Lea in their grasp and, after one
ihtensespasmof heroic effort, heabandoned himself
to theit clutch. Not, however, till he had perpe-
trated a terrible-, a dastardly crime. He struck the
governor—the Representative of Royalty—-the
Anointed Of John Macarthur! Eoveaux, at Lea’s
rUsh Up the steps, experienced that sensation of
patalysis which seizes upoh the bully-coward at
the approach Of danger. He stood s‘ark-still, and
so came easily Within the sweep of John Lea’s
fight arm, as, in the violence of the struggle with
the guard, he flung it out. His Excellency re-
coiled to the house-wall in actual pain, so forcible
was the blow which had fallen upon his face.
There was at least one onlooker who averred to
his dying day that the blow, so far as the receipt
by the Governor was concerned, was accidental.
If we believed that were so, we candidly confess
that we should leave the tragic close of J ohn Lea’s
life unchronicled. The man who, treated as Lea
was, and having the opportunity to strike his
tyrant, consciously withheld his hand, deserved
his doom.
Which was—death Death mstanter, on the
R P ot * ; •
Just beyond the angle of the liouSe-gardell,
in the park-land, but so close that a gadding
tenril from the vine within the angle pushed a
tender point into contact with its barkless bole,
stood a great Eucalyptus. One of its many stalwart
arms afforded to the connoisseur in the apparatus
of hanging satisfactory evidence that Nature
could be depended upon to furnish as complete a
gallows equipment as could be desired even by a
finished gentleman of Old Sydney. It was sound
and of ample length, and sprang from the trunk
at a sufficiently-low elevation to enable the rope
to be thrown round it without much difficulty,
while sufficiently high to supply the desideratum
of an effective neck-breakage, or strangulation—
the latter preferred.
To the foot of this tree, about half-an-hour after
Ex-private John Lea had occasioned Governor
Eoveaux some sudden pain, that heinous criminal
was haled by some fore-time comrades of the Rum-
selling Corps.
Governor Eoveaux would, when recollection and
Coolness of judgment returned to him, refer, as
his authority for the proceeding, to an eatly-day
regulation permitting ihstant execution for “overt
mutiny.” That regulation Was, of course, obso-
lete, otherwise Macarthur, Johnston, and Eoveaux
Would have been hanged not many months before.
Nevertheless it now served, or rather Would have
served, to hang John Lea had the Acting-Governor
only thought of it. Failing to recall it just at the
time, he procured his warrant from another
equally potential source—the maddened temper of
that infuriated bully, himself.
“ You won’t hang me in the sight of
the condemned man gasped in the Sergeant’s ear,
as he was pulled along from the guard-room to the
tree; ,
“The house?” The non-commissioned officer
ttot knowing what Left alluded to, filled up the
gap in the broken speech to suit his oWn fancy,
“ Oh, the old man won’t mind ! Damn it, Lea,
you hit me hard, but I’m sorry for you ! ”
“The house ! What do I care for the house —of
the old man—him—or you ! Are you men to hang
ine with them there ? ”
His arms were pinioned to his side—handcuffs;
pinioning cord and one-irich rope were always
available at the shortest notice at evety official
establishment in Old Sydney, whatever other
stores were lacking—and what he meant with his
hand he was thus unable to indicate. But he
jerked his head in the direction of the lower-park.
The Sergeant followed the index-sign with a
glance, and saw nothing more than a woman sit-
ting on the grass a few hundred yards away with
a child gambolling about her.
“Oh, that doesn’t matter! Never mind ’im,
Lea, but say a prayer for yourself.”
“ Don’t ye understand ”
“ Blindfold him there !” cried His Excellency,
who was not above attending to trifling details of
formality. “And bring out that sentry under
arrest. He shall hang him ! ”
In the jvrithings of the poor wretch, the word B
that fell from his lips, on which the death-ooze wa s
already visible, must have been unheeded by the
Sergeant and the other soldiers of the fatal escort,
or surely they had not been so contaminated by
the example of their superior officers as to be quite
insensate to the enormity they wereabouttocommit.
They had, s ine of them, been the condemned
man’s messmates, had fed out of the same dish,
from the same loaf. Surely, then, they would not
have been participators in that sacreligious out-
rage on the holiest of human shrines? They had
not the excuse, flimsy, but still an excuse, which
Eoveaux could offer, for thev had not been
devilised by the exercise of unbridled power.
Surely they did not hear ?
But though the escort did not heed the Con-
demned’s words, the disgraced sentry, who had
emerged under guard from the cell by the guard-
room, and been dragged into Eoveaux’s presence,
did.
“ Hang that man ! ” exclaimed the Authority,
“ and I’ll free you from arrest! ”
The soldier sickened. But—the drummer’s cats
while they were playing the first three or four
hundred of his thousand § would hurt acutely—
they would cut worse even than the three-dozen
he had once received —and someone would have
to haul on the rope. And why not he then ?
He consented —saluted —was marched over to
the tree —and laid hands on ex-Private Lea.
That was the beginning and the end of his per-
formance of an executioner’s duties. Bending
down to bind Lea’s legs he caught the meaning
of the dying man’s blurted phrase, and—the devil
Was in the silly fellow certainly—-drawing himself
to his full height, he gave one glance towards the
resting woman and the playing child, and threw
Up his billet.
“ I’ll take the flogging, sergeant!” he croaked.
“ If it kills me—well, the good God won’t forget
I didn’t do that in the sight of them”
All the sattie, as he retired under arrest, with
another three hundred added to his emoluments,
someone was found to take his place. That some
one soon put the finishing touch to ex-Private
Lea, grantee under “Discharged- Soldiers’Regu-
lations ” of fifty acres on the Hawkesbury, who,
could he have presented himself in London by a
certain day six months distant, would have come
into a small fortune. And now
# * ' *
“ Where is dada, muzzer?” had questioned
the little child, a girl of five. “ I’s gettin’ tired,
an’ wants to do home.” ( '
The woman, also somewhat Wearied with a
waiting now an hour long, called the child to her
lap from the verdant sward, tesselated With
wild flowers, where she had been gambolling,
and soothed her with sweet, silly mother’s talk;
“ Dada’ll be here soon, Polly—he’s gone to the
big house yonder to see the Governor. And then
we’ll go home. ”
“An’ will dada bwing me sweeties, muzzer—
you said I s’u’d have some ?”‘
“ So, dear, you shall, bye-and-bye —lots of
sweeties. And then, when we go ’cross the big,
big sea, in the big, big boat, oh, we shall have
such lots of money to buy sweeties for my little
girl with!”
The child turned in' her mother’s lap, in the
restlessness of an over-tired frame, and grew
querulous and tearful.
“ Oh, me do wish dada’d come—l’s so tired !”
“ Hush, dearie, —he will come soon—p’r’aps the
Governor’s busy, and dada can’t see him ”
The tiny tot, nestling against her mother’s right
shoulder, was looking up the hill, and interrupted
her mother by eager, curious exclamations.
“Muzzer, muzzer! Look! See what they’s
doin’! Oh, isn’t that funny, muzzer 1”
She did not feel her weariness now—that
strange thing dangling fantastically, with every
movement made clearly visible by the cloudless
ether, amused her immensely. She stood up, and
laughed, and clapped her hands.
The woman turned her head at the child’
enquiry, and then hastily interposed herself
between the spectacle on the crest of the eminence
and the little girl’s sight. The child did not
understand, she thought!
And did she—then? Not till later. When
they gave her the body.
PRICE WARUNG.
* “Tlie novice of going away ”—till well on in the

an csuecial reason—and thereby hangs a tale.

Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets are the pleasantest and most efficacious
medicine for all Blood and Skin Diseases and Erupt ions, as also for
Constipation and Rheumatism. They are invaluable for the com-
plexion, as they free the pores of the Skin from all obstructive and
tainted matters. They are positively safe for men, women, and
children ; for the young and the aged, and for the weak as well as the
strong. They are eminently suitable for children’s ailments, and are
much liked by the little ones. As a safe and purifying remedy, as a
clearer and beautifier of the complexion, Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets
have no equal, while their palliative properties in Rheumatism, Gout,
&c., render them a most desirable remedy to always have in the house.
Frazer’s Sulphur Tablets are for internal use ; they are pleasant to the
taste, agreeable to the eyes, and yet withal possess proved medicinal
efficacy. They are valuable to ward off colds and chills, by keeping
the pores gently open.
FRAZER’S SULPHUR TABLETS are put up in packets, price

“Really!”
“If you were to drop ‘ Oh! ’ and * Really ? ’ out
of the English language, the major part of tae
British aristocracy would be destitute of con ver-
sation.”
Such was the remark an American friend made
to me the other c'a •. We were discussing the
question referred to in a recent newspaper letter
—the alleged inferiority of American men to
Englishmen in polish, refinement, social accom-
plishments, general information, and conversa-
tional powers. I had to laugh, it seemed so very
true.
“ I’m afraid I’ll have to agree with you,” I
said ; “ I’ve often thought the same thing mys* If.
And if you’d bar the interrogatives, ‘ Did you ?’
‘Were you?’ ‘ Was it?’ ‘Did it?’ ‘Does it?’ ‘ls
he ?’ etc., spoken with a labored emphasis outlie
first word, in reply to every remark or suggestion
yon make, nine-tenths of them would have to sit
silent.”
“Precisely. So they would. There’s one other
word, when I come to think of it, which wo may
leave out, too ; it’s 1 Fancy ! ’ Now, I think we’ve
collared the swell’s vocabulary. Deprive the
swells of these words and the stereotyped inter-
rogations you suggest, and, so far as they were
concerned, silence would reign supreme. Take an
English country-house. For example, the break-
fast-table. These breakfasts are all alike. I’ve
been present at dozens, in as m.yny different houses,
and one description will fit all; the same chill
atmosphere of male gruffness and female rigidity
permeates each. Now, it’s a curious thing that,
the other day, I was thinking about this thing,
and hastily scratched down some notes and im-
pressions from recollection. I’ve got ’em in my
pocket-book, and, if you don’t mind, I’ll read
them to you.”
So he began :
SCENE.
Breakfast-room at Beaulieu Manor. High wains-
cot of old oak ; walls papered in deep maroon ;
deep maroon damask window-curtains , and
maroon, leather-seated chairs. Old oak fire-
place ; log-fire in the grate ; long breakfast-
table, hissing urn and tea-things at one end,
four covered silver dishes at the other, containing
cutlets, sausages, poached eggs, and curried
fowl. In the middle and up the sides, plates of
hot rolls in napkins; a large dish of butter
scrolls and bullets, a silver stand of boiled eggs,
a glass dish of orange marmalade, and two
racks of dry toast. On sideboard, cold ham,
beef, game, and huge loaf of bread.
PEOPLE AT TABLE.
Lady Bab-Dexter (the lady of the house) aged
thirty-five, once pretty, now buxom, with that
burnt-faced, diminishing-eyed look which the
average high-born British matron (unless a
“ frisky ') gets in a few years after marriage,
and is not so much the result of annual mater-
nity as the effect of an unlimited consumption
ofbroivn stout at luncheon and brown sherry
at dinner.
The Hon. Mbs. Yilliers and Miss Villiebs,
mother and daughter. Mother, grey-haired,
arched eye-brows, pale, thin, and icy ; daugh-
ter, thorough-bred and shy.
Lady Violet Cbopper, a “frisky"; pretty,
bold, cold-eyed, and horsey.
Lobd Henby’Noddle, her brother.
Captain Fitzrubbishe, of the Queens Own Bom-
bardiers.
[Silence reigns. Enter your humble servant —
whom we will call Mb. Thompson Witha-
pee, of Philadelphia. Both the men are
reading their letters while they eat, the torn-
open envelopes littering the table and adjoin-
ing plates. ]
Men— “ Bawl” [which I interpret as “Good-
morning. ”]
Women— “Ning !” [which I ditto'].
[I seat myself in one of a half-dozen vacant places
amid utter silence. After a pause :]
Lady Bar-Dexter— “Tea, Mr. Withapee?”
I—“ If you please.”
[Lady 8.-D. pours out the tea and I wait some
minutes.]
Lady Bar-Dexter —‘ Here is your tea, Mr.
Withapee. [/ am separated from her ladyship by
Noddle and Fitzbubbishe, but neither offers to
pass the cup.] “Come and get it, please.” [This
I discover to be the custom. Every one gets up and
goes for his own tea. Igo hack to my seat and won-
der hoiv I shall get something to eat. While I sip
my tea and puzzle about it:]
Lady Bab-Dexter —“TheHammonds come to-
morrow, Captain Fitzrubbishe.”
Captain Fitzrubbishe— “ Oh ! Do they ? ”
Lady Bab-Dexter —“ They can only stay two
nights, though.”
Captain Fitzrubbishe— “ Really. Can’t they?”
[Enter Lord Basil Dumplinge, age twenty-five, in
scarlet hunting-coat and top-boots.]
Men— “ Baw ! ”
Women— “ ’Ning ! ”
[Dumplinge makes straight for the silver dishes,
lifts the cover off each, aud scrutinises contents
through eye-glass. Looks disappointed, but
helm himself to a poached egg, and carries it to
seat next me. Sits down and prroceeds to open
his letters, which are in a pile beside his plate.
I take the tip, and go and help myself to a
sausage.]
Lord Basil Dumplinge [with eyes on letter] —
“By Jove ! I say ” —[to Lady Violet Cropper,
to whom he hasn’t before spoken.]
Lady Violet— “ Hello ! ”
Lord Basil— “ Here’s a lark! The Jones-
Fieldings have a meet at their shop next
Tuesday.”
Lady Violet—" Never ! ”
[Lord Basil tears open another letter with his
thumb.]
Captain Fitzrubbishe—“ Really !”
Lady Bar-Dexter[<oMissVilliers]— “There’s
to be a hunt-ball at Boskell next week.”
Miss Villiers—“ /s there ? ’
[Enter Sib John Bab-Dexter, a bearded man of
forty-five, and a bluff manner, also in hunt-
ing “pink.’’]
Men —“ Baw I”
Women —“ ’Ning!”
Sir John [after helping himself in silence to
some cold grouse from the sideboard] —“Look
sharp, Dumplinge. Ha’-pas’ nine and eight miles
to Tombridge Tun.”
Lady Violet— “ Going to ride Vixie?”
Lord Basil—" No fear.”
[7 have disposed of my sausage and think Ell say
something.]
I—“ What a beautiful view there is from my
room window, Lady Bar-Dexter.”
Lady Bar-Dexter —“ Oh, is there ?”
I —“It is the finest woodland scenery I can
remember.”

During the evening, the coroner commenced dis-
coursing, in an imaginative manner, upon the
manner of the lonely death, and the weirdness of
the locality. This sort of thing was laughed at by
the squatter, who offered, for a bet of <£5,
to ride to the spring and back before mid-
night. The question arose as to how the
coroner should know that the ride had been
duly performed. The constable settled the ques-
tion by remarking that the dead swagman’s pipe,
knife, and tobacco were lying on a stone beside
the remains of the fire. However, the wager
didn’t come off. The squatter happened to be
down at the men's hut the following evening ;
noticing an old swagman sitting by the fire, he
enquired : “ Do you want any tobacco, old man ?”
“ No, thanks ; I made a rise where I camped last
night. Some carrier left his knife, pipe, and
tobacco on a stone, and made a big heap of earth
—what for, I couldn’t make out. Anyhow, it
served me for a pillow.” Now, had the bet been
made, and the squatter come cantering round the
sharp turn in the road before reaching the spring,
it is just possible that time would have been too
precious for mutual enquiries. The old fellow
might have been travelling towards the coast the
next day, and the district would have had a brand-
new ghost.

Another precious Adelaide “saint” has
gone on the broad path, accompanied by a large
amount of loose cash. He worked the impression-
able Adelaide people in the usual way. He came
from—well, abroad ; and from what has been said,
he came in a hurry. He soon found out the best
way to make a living in Adelaide —made a
bee-line for one of the churches, where he speedily
became an official. At holy meetings and sacred
lectures he was all there, and at praying he was a
splendid grafter, fervency being bis speciality.
He was the best hand ever known in the sacred
city at an impromptu prayer, barring Crooks, the
felonious bank manager, and the gaoled Walker,
ex-Adelaide Y.M.C.A. secretary. And now
he is missing, like the others w'ero, and his till is
empty, and all is desolation.
Many ridiculously high-flown paragraphs
are going the rounds concerning Holt, now within
the seclusion of Darlinghurst prison for forgery.
The facts are that Holt was a most commonplace
swindler, and it must irritate many worthy people
who have had dealings with him to hear the
fellow exalted as a distressed British “nobleman,”
and spoken of as “coming from good stock.” &c.
“The Majors ” distinguished chuck-a-chest mili-
tary air was acquired from the master for whom
he performed the duties of valet, though he him-
self ascribed it to the fact that he had been
equerry to the Duke of Connaught, no less. His
figure (if he did not wear stays he was the kind of
man who would) was well-known in the lunch-
hour on the Sydney Block, where he was much
admired —by little shop-girls—but his best effort
was the wheedling of £200 out of a weak, confiding
teacher of singing—the amount was handed to
him to invest in a safe and profitable venture
recommended by “TheMajor.” There were tech-
nical difficulties in the way of a prosecution, other-
wise this man of pedigree would have ceased
to bilk landladies some years ago. The newspapers
give out that he “ occupied a responsible position
in the city,” which being interpreted means that
he formerly presided over “ the carpets ” in a
retail softgoods shop. Latterly he ran a matri-
monial agency in Melbourne and Sydney, but
without much success, as the game is almost
played out. But beyond all doubt he for some
years pervaded Sydney as the quintessence of a
fifth-rate British snob, and on Ids trial the other
day a count should have been added to the indict-
ment charging him with that offence.

Somebody—a hopeless lunatic apparently
—writes to the Sydney Echo : —
Legislation has assumed the burlesque type. In order
to reduce as far as possible the amount of mischief done
by Parliaments, I think that it is desirable that all action
not completed between 6 a.m. and 12 p.m. (midnight)
shall be illegal; also, that injuries inflicted shall be
punishable by the exercise of Governmental authority
and that injuries inflicted wilfully shall ho punishable by
Crown prosecution, even flogging being resorted to in
cases of flagrant embezzlements, wife-beating, &c. jj.
object is to protect the weak from brutal attacks. 3 |
The address of the asylum the writer escaped out
of isn’t given. Why didn’t the Echo admit
letters from this variety of maniac when the
Mount Rennie prisoners were being tried at four
o'clock in the morning? That seems to come
under the head of “all action not completed
between G a.m. and 12 p.m. (midnight).”
