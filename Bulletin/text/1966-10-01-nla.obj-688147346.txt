LETTERS
Prisoners of Conscience
Sir,
The South Australian section, of
Amnesty International has been work-
ing on behalf of two Indonesian
prisoners, one being Tojo Wirjosan
Sukiman, a former Prime Minister,
1951-2, who was imprisoned with
Sjahrir and many other prominent poli-
ticians in January, 1962. He was re-
leased at the same time as Mochtar
Lubis.
Lieutenant-General Suharto has
stated that detainees from the rebellions
in 1958 will receive a fair trial. We
also trust that those who have been
detained since October, 1965, will re-
ceive similar treatment. Further, we
ask that any person who is physically
restrained from expressing an honestly
held opinion which neither advocates
nor condones violence should be re-
leased. The current purges in China are
an equally grave danger to freedom
of opinion, but it is extremely naive of
Peter Samuel to say (8., June 18) that
we should “treat them as violations of
human rights which could appropriately
be taken up by the United Nations.”
As far back as 1948 the United Nations
introduced a Declaration of Human
Rights on the understanding that a
covenant between member States would
be produced, turning these moral rights
into positive legal rights. Eighteen years
later it is evident that practically no
progress has been made toward this
covenant. In 1953 a Republican Gov-
ernment in the U.S.A. stated that it
would not sign such a covenant.
As the United Nations has been so
ineffectual in influencing its own mem-
bers on the delicate subject of human
rights, a sore spot to many govern-
ments, what reason is there to suppose
that it could bring any pressure to bear
on a non-member? In our time it rests
with those concerned about the preser-
vation of the fundamental human
rights of freedom of opinion and
religion to voice their concern by exert-
rng unbiased pressure on those authori-
ties appearing to violate these rights.
In this respect we, in Australia, have
a special duty toward prisoners of con-
science in China, both Communist
mainland and National Taiwan. It is
very difficult to gather information on
Chinese prisoners, but there must be

Tariff Policy
Sir,
I refer to your recent sub-leader
captioned “The Pride of the West.” It
refers inter alia to the iron ore deposits
and the Ord River scheme and ends
by saying “State pride is running high
and it is far more fashionable to point
out that Western Australia’s per capita
export income leads Australia.” To
refer to such a subject as being “fash-
ionable” is not unfair comment, but far
from reflecting general current thought.
Western Australian citizens at large are
as moribund in their thinking on such
subjects as their counterparts in the
Eastern States.
I have no special knowledge of the
merits or demerits of the Ord River
Scheme or the Commonwealth Govern-
ment’s attitude to the Hamersley Iron
pellet contract. I am, however, ever
fully cognisant of the colossal subsidisa-
tion being paid by the community at
large and primary industry in particu-
lar by way of a high Customs Tariff.
For instance, few Australians can be
aware that there are U.K. preferential
rates in the schedule as high as 45 per-
cent and one even 90 percent.
Under the shield of the Tariff plus
high overseas freight rates the manu-
facturer can usually charge what he
likes and force his wares on purchasers
however reluctant. If the protective
rates, high as they undoubtedly are,
should be deemed insufficient, all he
has to do is appeal to the Department
of Trade, which refers the matter to a
Special Authority for express action
pending reference to the Tariff Board.
It will be advanced and should be
appreciated that a policy of full em-
ployment and defence must be para-
mount considerations in the encourage-
ment of secondary industry. It should
also be appreciated that a too-rigid
Tariff policy employed for such pur-
poses has a very damaging effect on
primary industry, which, of course, is
the ultimate sufferer through inability
to pass on costs. Furthermore, punitive
rates affecting a gopd customer such
as Japan, which has its own worry
over the balance of trade, causes ill-
"'dl and makes nonsense of the recent
Pious pronouncements of goodwill
e manating from the Department of
External Affairs. In the long run such
a policy recoils on secondary industry,
which the Government is so fanatically
en gaged in succoring.

Defending Britten
Sir,
It was charitable of you to allow
Maria Wolkowsky to use a book review
as a peg for some highly idiosyncratic
outpourings on Benjamin Britten (B.
August 13), but surely unnecessary to
compound the foolishness by heading it
“Britten’s Backwardness.” Contrary to
Miss Wolkowsky’s belief, Britten’s
music is accepted internationally, or at
any rate in countries which are cultur-
ally mature. There is ample published

A car capable of accelerating ferociously
up to 105 m.p.h. does not at first appear to
be a candidate for safety awards. Yet the
fact is that the Rover 2000 has been hailed
by every motoring writer or authority of note
throughout the world as the safest car of our
time. Our own “Wheels” magazine calls it
“the world’s finest argument against the
people who would eliminate all fast cars”.
The American “Car and Driver” says:— “If
every car on the road were as good as this
one, they could raise every speed limit in the
country fifteen miles'an hour and still have a
reduced accident rate”. The British “Auto-
mobile Association”, in presenting the
Rover 2000 with its top safety award, says,
simply, “its high degree of inherent safety is
much in advance of its time and has set the
pattern for future design”. What does this
mean to you? It means that, for less than
$5OOO, you get three cars in one:

evidence of this, as well as the commis-
sions which Britten has received from
bodies such as the International Red
Cross, performances at United Nations
Concerts, etc. His music is accepted by
more of the public than most modern
music is, and also by most musicians
and critics the dodecaphonies and
the neo-Webernians excepted.
And it is not accepted as English
music, in the deprecating way Miss
Wolkowsky suggests. It is as interna-
tional as the music of, say, Schoenberg
or Frank Martin or Witold Lutoslaw-
ski. Each of these composers has a
nationality which gets mentioned in
program notes, and in Britten’s case this
is probably a handicap. Play him
anonymously (and this can be tried
with any recording of a new work) and
very few can pick the music as English
unless it is a vocal work.
Britten has never shown any real
interest in contemporary cults, those
egghead Beatle-manias which during
his chreer have ranged from Sibelian
forest-tempestry to Stockhausen-Nono-
Boulez plink-plonkery. In this sense,
presumably Miss Wolkowsky’s sense,
his music is not of its times. But it is
not of any other times, and I doubt
whether Miss -Wolkowsky can name
any music by an earlier composer to
whom Britten has looked back in the
“Suite for Solo Cello,” the “Nocturnal
for Guitar,” or “Curlew River.”
A study of any Britten score will
show the severe intellectual disciplines
within which he composes. That he is
able, like Bach or Berg, to conceal
their complexities and difficulties from
Miss Wolkowsky and from the listener
at large is a measure of his greatness.

Indooroopilly (Q.)
Whose Zoo?
I quote from “Taronga Park: Who’s
Zoo?” (8., August 13): “Taronga Park
needs to be told, quite clearly, that it
must cease encouraging those people
who say ‘Let’s take it to the zoo’ when-
ever they come upon a young or dis-
abled creature in the bush.”
I ask, what should a conservation-
minded person do? Leave a young or
disabled bush creature to die a linger-
ing death? One expects that the
Taronga Park Zoo at least has some
Staff and facilities for looking after the
welfare of young or disabled “strictly
protected” native fauna.

a nd being inured to literary punish-
I have never before “answered
back” to a critic but I do feel that
\ must answer his charge of my
“startling lack of perspicacity” by
pointing out his.
He does seem to me to have com-
pletely missed the point of what the
book is all about. Clearly he wanted
some other sort of book altogether, cer-
tainly not at all the type of book Good-
man and I wanted to put together.
I would have thought Higham “so
skilled a professional writer” also that
he must have seen, for a start, the
subject limitations imposed by a text
of a mere 50,000 words, of which half
had to be a kind of running com-
mentary wedded to the pictures and the
rest rigidly allocated page by page,
where literally every line had to be
fitted to exact typographical layout and
the run of illustrations. Within this
very restricting writing frame the
enormous theme of this land and its
people had to be presented, and it was
necessary to cover or to sketch in the
geology, geography, and history of Aus-
tralia, its problems and its develop-
ment, its economics, its achievements
in industry, the sciences, the arts,
sports, wars, migration, and give some
sort of observation on the Australian
character.
That this attempt did, in fact, come
off, is amply shown by other reviews of
the book, which gratifyingly made
clear that the intention had been com-
municated to most people. But Mr.
Higham wanted much more money’s
worth than this. It seems he also
wanted the book to be a detailed cata-
logue and hierarchical calendar of
prominent Australians plus detailed
material on modern architecture, the
state of religion in Australian society,
the history and personalities of our
post-war politics, and Galbraithian
social studies of our affluence. (If he
reads the text more carefully he will
see that I have, in fact, gone into our
“levelling egalitarian casualness and
parsimony.”) By his terms of reference,
in short, the text would have had to
be written either in the concise style of
an urgent telegram or be about as long
as “The Golden Bough.” Mr. Higham
will no doubt provide me with his
formula of elasticity for fitting an in-
finite number of words into an ever-
enlarging space, a kind of literary
expanding universe.
Mr. Higham seems particularly up-
set by the absence of Patrick White’s
picture. I am not, although I bow to
nobody, not even Mr. Higham, in my
admiration of Mr. White (who is one
°f the few writers specifically men-
tioned in my text), because the book
was never intended to be a Gallery of
Greats, but a picture book of reason-
ably representative Australians. And
with those inflexibly imposed exigencies
°f space, where do we draw the line?
if Patrick White goes in, does Judith
Wright come out? Or Mary Durack?
But we were very anxious to suggest
Bow, in a masculine country, women
have been powerful figures in the arts,
especially writing. And there are very
many Australians who probably prefer
Mary Durack to Patrick White and
might very properly resent having Mr.
Higham telling them which deities they
should or should not worship.
Mr. Higham is anxious musically,
too, but if it is to be Meale, what hap-
pens to Sculthorpe? Does Drysdale
have to go to fit Nolan in? Who or
what is the arbiter? We settled for
good, representative pictures rather
than impossible protocol.

One for the Books
Sir,
Your editorial “One For The Books”
(8., September 17) is a delightful exer-
cise in journalistic cunning. One
sentence stands out, “. . . The clergy-
men have no plans to sell pamphlets
available which describe the cruelty
and torture inflicted on the South Viet-
namese civilians by the Viet Cong . . .”
“Aha!” says your reader, “the clergymen
are part of a Communist conspiracy to
overrun the country.”
I was one of the “Peace Parsons,”
and I’d be prepared to sell any seized
pamphlet which depicted accurately
and objectively the atrocities of the
war, whether on the VC or American
side, if suitable occasion arose. Such
literature always presents an implicit
condemnation of the barbaric prac-
tice of war. I must confess that I’d be
very reluctant to be so consistent
regarding censorship if there were a
political seizure of a pamphlet which
glorified war. The incident of seizure
which compelled us to act provided a
perfect opportunity to depict the terror
of war, because these atrocities were
inflicted by OUR side the side which
we have been propagandarised into
believing commits no evil. Much to
the amazement of us all, we are dis-
covering that Americans do commit
evils. The Aussie must be the only
pure soldier left.
In your last sentence, you further
befuddle the reader by indicating that
any literature that presents the U.S.
in a critical light is classified these days

Porter’s Protest
Sir,
Hal Porter is furious because I
revealed the plot of his play, “The
Professor” (8., September 10).
While the scenariq of a whodunnit is
obviously sacrosanct; it is hard to see
any serious play, from “Hamlet” to
“Godot,” being ruined by prior know-
ledge of the plot.
Obviously I was wrong to take Mr.
Porter’s whodunnit seriously.

CONTEMPT AND THE PRESS
bulletin
86 Years Ago: October 2, 1880.
\The Supreme Court had fined the
proprietors of the “EVENING
NEWS’ ’ £250 for its contempt of
court in an article of August 21,
called “Temporary Judge Windeyer
and the Press,” in which it referred
to His Honor’s “utter want of
judicial impartiality,” “utter unfitness
for the judicial office,” “grievous con-
tempt of justice,” and “degradation
of the judicature of this colony.”]
of the judges in Banco did
a very inexpedient thing, and it
may be an unwise one, on Friday last.
In the first place they constituted
themselves the prosecutors, judges, and
juries of a newspaper that had
criticised one of their number in a
manner too caustic; and, in the
second place, they defended their pro-
cedure on precedents over a century
old, the shreds and patches of a tradi-
tional forensic despotism that should
have been allowed to remain obsolete.
What can their Honors hope to gain
by exhibiting this hostile front to the
community ?
The fine imposed on the Messrs.
Bennett will probably be paid by
three-penny subscriptions throughout
the country, and indignant protests
will be made against what will be
designated the arbitrary or tyrannical
conduct of their Honors.
When Parliament meets there will
be a lively hubbub over the disagree-
able business. It is doubtless a very
heinous offence to contemn the judges
of the Supreme Court, but more
serious and more significant in its
ultimate consequences is it for the
judges to contemn public opinion.
ir pHE Mayor of Sydney has called
a public meeting for Tuesday
evening next, at the Masonic Hall, to
consider the action of their Honors
the Judges in regard to the recent
case of “contempt of Court.” .Many
influential citizens are thoroughly de-
termined to protect their liberties.

CAN MOVE
30.000 TONS OF
COAL A DAY!
A5BO/7
At Morwell Victoria, the longest single-flight,
high-speed conveyor system in Australia is
carrying brown coal from the open cut to Hazel-
wpod Power Station, 1f miles away. Plans for the
conveyor system were adopted by the State
Electricity Commission Victoria after a thorough
investigation of all means of transporting coal
over such a distance.
Built to exacting specifications by Goodyear
Tyre and Rubber Co. (Australia) Ltd., the two
steel cable conveyors operate at a speed of 1050
feet a minute carrying 2000 tons of coal an hour.
The belts are 7244 feet and 8560 feet long, 48
inches wide, approximately £ inch thick and con-
sist entirely of rubber and 500 miles of steel
cables. Minimum breaking strength is 423,000
pounds. The structure of the belt allows the cable
maximum lateral movement. There is no tearing
under impact!
The seven miles of Goodyear belting used on
the two mainlines for Hazelwood is another
example of the numerous advantages of steel
cable belting. It has an extremely high tensile
strength. Its design makes it trough perfectly and
have the best impact resistance of any belt con-
struction. Stretching and elongation is negligible
so short take up lengths are possible.
If you have a project where you need conveyor
belting remember Goodyear conveyor belting. It’s
the best. Contact the Goodyear technical man at
the Goodyear branch in
your state.

Face of the Week
The Ansett-ANA Viscount crash,
in which all 24 on board died, was
Australia’s first airline fatality in
more than four years. Before the
week’s other crash at Tennant
Creek, Air Minister Swartz had re-
ported 150 non-airline accidents dur-
ing the past year, with 31 deaths.
He said the expanding air service
would need another 1500 pilots in
the next five years. National De-
velopment Minister Fairbairn told
Parliament there were no jobs in
sight big enough for the Snowy
Mountains Authority. Archbishop
Strong of Brisbane was elected
Anglican Primate. The N.Z.
Defence Minister, Mr. Eyre, said
political federation with Australia

A strike of 3000 Victorian SEC

power restrictions, extensive factory
lay-offs, and cuts in electric train
services and TV and radio broad-
casts. In Sydney’s continuing crime
wave safebreakers took $103,000
from a city bank vault and started
a fire which razed a $350,000 Coles’

dicts, a Sydney girl was awarded
$170,000 and a Brisbane girl
$43,000 for life-affecting injuries. A
CMF commando fell to his death
from a rope over the Melbourne
Show ring. Air hostesses gained sub-
stantial increases in pay and leave.
Warana began in Brisbane. Senator

OCTOBER 1, 1966
Find the Crisis
FOR the first time the Federal
Government has not accepted
in full the recommendations of the
Australian Universities Commis-
sion. The Universities, after last
week’s decision, will not get all the
money the Commission suggested,
and a total of ss6m. will be lopped
off a program of ss6Bm. for the
coming three years. Academic pro-
tests against this decision are in-
evitable, but before they are taken
too seriously it is worth looking at
the context in which the decision
has been made.
Universities have boomed as
almost nothing else in recent years,
with even the expansion of our
defence effort paling into insig-
nificance by comparison. The
number of students enrolled has
doubled in the past six years and
expenditure —90 percent of which
is provided by the Governments —
has quadrupled in the same period.
Although justified by circum-
stances, this growth has taken its
toll in terms of lowered standards
and haphazardly spent money, and
now that the postwar “baby boom”
has been absorbed and the growth
in the number of students will
slacken the Universities will do
well to pause and consolidate. In
any case they have been provided
with a program which will enable
them to spend ten percent more
each year to 1969, so their expan-
sion will go on, if at a slower rate
than they are used to.
But other areas of education
have a strong claim on public
money. If there are any crises in
Australian education today they are
not in Universities but in the tech-
nical colleges, the teacher training
colleges, and some secondary
schools. The first are getting a mas-
sive financial boost in the coming
triennium, and the foundations are
being laid for a complete trans-
formation of technological educa-
tion in the 19705. Trade training
remains inadequate and outdated,
but that is due entirely to trade
union obstruction of the Common-
wealth’s plans for reform. Teacher
training is something which the
Commonwealth will have to take
over some time, since the States
cannot do an adequate job.
As for the Universities Commis-
sion, the new decision suggests it
will have to play a greater role than
at present in co-ordinating the
development of Universities and
reducing costs by eliminating un-
necessary overlapping and ensur-
ing a degree of uniformity in
standards and practices. The Gov-
ernment cannot continue to give
money without strings to those uni-
versities whose administrators are
known to be inefficient, and the
Commission cannot let universities
continue to get away with such
tricks as deliberately exaggerating
the number of students they intend
to accept in order to get more
money. Individual Universities can-
not be expected to like this but it
is difficult to see how a responsible
Federal Government, driven to pro-
viding so much of the money, can
avoid it. Completely independent
development only seems possible on
the basis of significant financial in-
dependence, and that means mas-
sive but unlikely efforts by uni-
versities to raise money not only
through fees but through ap-
proaches to business.
This may still be worth trying,
even this late in the day, but other-
wise there is no real alternative to
increasing Government direction.


THIS AUSTRALIA
Calwell’s Achilles’ Heel
A diverse collection of internal critics, such as Deputy Opposition Leader Mr'.
Gough Whitlam, prominent ALP front-bencher Kim Beazley, the MHR for Batman,
Captain Sam Benson (now ex-ALP), and the Australian Workers’ Union, as well
as others, have either said or indicated plainly that Labor’s foreign policy is its
electoral Achilles’ heel.
If their thesis is accepted, it would
seem that Labor should be trying
urgently to play down the announce-
ment by Labor Leader Arthur Calwell
some time ago that the central theme
for the November 26 general Federal
elections would be foreign policy, par-
ticularly as it applied to Vietnam and
conscription.
Calwell has been an ardent anti-
eonscriptionist since his youth. (Beazley
in his article in “The Australian Out-
look” of August this year, pointed out
that Calwell opposed conscription in
1942 when the possibility of a Japanese
invasion of Australia still existed.) But
even Calwell at one stage seemed to
be having second thoughts about the
electoral value of foreign affairs for
Labor. He seemed to be trying to
switch the issue deliberately on to
domestic bread-and-butter questions.
At this period Calwell said that the
Government was not going to get
away with an election fought on just
foreign policy. Calwell indicated that
he viewed the Government as having
many shortcomings in the field of
domestic administration for which he
proposed to have an accounting. As
recently as last week Calwell again
seemed to be expressing doubt about
the electoral worth to Labor of the
foreign policy issue. In a statement
remarkable for the bitterness of its
tone and its almost sectarian flavor,
Calwell, commenting upon Pope Paul's
plea for peace, commented sourly:
“But I’m afraid there are many thou-
sands of reactionary Australians, in-
cluding Catholics, who will be opposed
to peace negotiations, as the Pope sug-
gests.”
Yet, last week in the Parliament,
Labor was drawn irresistibly back to
the foreign policy issue. Labor Parlia-
mentarians started to pepper Prime
Minister Holt with questions on Viet-
nam. As it turned out, Holt scored
heavily on the technical side. He was
able to point out the different treatment
accorded Benson expelled for belonging
to an organisation formed to study
Australia’s defence problems in the
light of the current foreign affairs
situation and those ALP members who
were allowed to associate unchallenged
with prominent Communists,
Holt was able to make even larger
capital of the fact that the Singapore
Prime Minister Mr. Lee Kuan Yew
who Labor itself had built up as one
of the most capable and farseeing non-
Communist Socialist leaders of the
South-East Asian area had specially
invited a Labor delegation to Singa-
pore so that they would have a clearer
view of the situation in that area of the
world than Labor’s foreign policy
seemed to suggest they had.
Holt quoted Benson as saying that
Lee had told the Labor delegation
that the ALP’s view on the struggle
in South Vietnam was the wrong view
that it was most important that
the Communists had to be stopped,
and that if South Vietnam fell to the
Communists it would be only a mat-
ter of time before Singapore fell.
Holt challenged those Labor Parlia-
mentarians who had participated in
the Singapore visit to deny that the
Benson version of what Lee , said was
correct. When his challenge was re-
ceived in stony silence, Holt said that
if Lee had made such a statement the
Labor Parliamentarians had a respon-
sibility to pass it on to the Australian
electorate, but nobody except Benson
had.
There seem to be three reasons
why Labor is drawn back, suicidally
according to Beazley and the others
to this foreign affairs issue. Firstly \[
is the issue that has driven a split
almost straight down the middle of
the Labor Party and hence many Labor
Members view it as an inescapable
topic of debate. Secondly, the Left-
wing of the Labor Party reject com-
pletely the analysis of the Beazley,s and
others who see in the foreign affairs
only an electoral debit. The Left-wing
see particularly the associated issue
of conscription for overseas service as
the “sleeper” that could put Labor
into office and consequently they want
foreign policy emphasised as an elect-
tion issue, not avoided. Thirdly, there
is the section of the Labor Party that
believes Labor has absolutely no chance
of winning the elections, but only of
losing further seats. This section
fatalistically say that it does not matter
what issue the coming elections are
fought on.
Their attitude is that the only
important thing is whether the Right-
or Left-wing has the larger number of
casualties, because upon these casual-
ties will depend the composition of
the post-election Caucus which will
select Labor’s new leader when Calwell
steps down after what they regard as
the inevitable Labor defeat.
ALAN REID
Student Votes
There will be a lot of talk about Vietnam and conscription during the November
election campaign, but they will apparently be almost impotent as issues that decide
voting decisions, at least among some sections of the electorate.
This is the overwhelming impression,
judging from a survey of Melbourne
University students, the results of
which were issued last week. The
Students’ Representative Council sent its
questionaires to every fourth student
enrolled at the start of the year. Com-
pleted forms came.back from 2700, or
80 percent of those sent out.
Almost predictably, only 20 percent
gave blanket approval of the Govern-
ment’s Vietnam conscription policy.
Also predictably, the under-21s were
more against it than the 21s and over.
But the surprise to some, anyway
was that, despite this overwhelming
opposition, it apparently was not strong
enough to turn a majority away front
support for the Government parties
politically. To the question asking how
they would vote at the coming election,
44 percent said they would support the
Government parties and only 25 per-
cent said they would vote Labor, The
DLP got eight percent, the Com-
munists one percent, and 22 percent
were undecided.
Among those who said they would
support the present Government, only
one in four said also that they favored
the conscription policy. Even one in
four of the Labor supporters said they
approved the present policy on con-
scription. Another 25 percent of the
Laborites said they would not help
South Vietnam at all, and the rest
said economic aid only. DLP attitudes
paralleled those of Government party
supporters.
A referendum among Sydney Uni-
versity students held earlier this year
yielded similar results the majority
of students were in favor of sending'
volunteer troops to South Vietnam but
were opposed to the sending of con-
scripts. Fifty-nine percent, however,
supported conscription if it did not
mean being sent to Vietnam.
In the Melbourne survey the main
reasons advanced against approving
the conscription scheme were that com-
pulsory service abroad should be intro-
duced only in times of “national
emergency.” Most just did not put the
Vietnam war in that category. Less
than 13 percent quibbled about the use
of the ballot system as a decider, Most
of the others were against compulsory
service either locally or abroad, and
3,9 percent were against all forms of
military service. Seventy-four percent
were in favor of economic aid for
South Vietnam either with or
without military help as well.
PATRICK TENNIS ON


Canberra’s Autumn of Reports
SPRING is autumn in Canberra. It
is the season when the trees of
Government, as if through an in-
exorable biological mechanism, throw
off their annual reports. Borne by
energetic ants and by the eddying winds
of the Postal Department, some find
their way into the bank of letterboxes
in that section of Parliament House
called the Press Gallery. There they
collect, adding color and depth to the
lighter year-round fall of dull “Press
Releases” from the evergreen Public
Relations Plants.
This year’s heaviest fall was from
that piece of Government woods known
as the Australian Universities Commis-
sion. Its report of 335 scuffy roneo
pages v was unique in a number
of respects. Not surprisingly it recom-
mended the expenditure of a uniquely
large amount of money on Universities,
ss6Bm. over the three years 1967, 1968,
and 1969, a 45 percent increase on the
amount spent during the triennium just
finishing. More spectacular still is the
fact that it represents a quintupling
of expenditure since the last years of
the 50s.
For the first time, however, the Uni-
versity Commission’s recommendations
have not been accepted in full. The
history of this is that the State Treasu-
ries got copies just in time to put in
protests at the Premiers’ Conference in
June and demand special talks with the
Commonwealth. All States except the
supposedly poor ones W.A. and Tas-
mania said adamantly that they
could not find their share of the money,
about half the total. The Common-
wealth, in return for a promise to bear
some of the political burden of the
costs, got the States to agree to a
larger program than they intended.
The result: A ss6m. cut to a pro-
gram of ssl2m. Most of the cut is
on the capital side, building expendi-
ture going up from sBBm. to slo9m.
instead of up to sl39m. as recom-
mended. Half this cut is for N.S.W.
universities; so great is it indeed that
Victoria will be doing more university
building in the forthcoming three years
than N.S.W. The feeling in the Com-
mission is that this will only affect
its program more marginally.
The report makes it clear that as
the Commonwealth gets more deeply
involved in university financing, it will
attempt to gain corresponding increases
in influence. It is making sure, for
instance, that the Victorian Universities
fit in with the AUC’s plans. Melbourne
University’s notoriously bad administra-
tion is being given more money than it
asked for, but will be more closely
supervised. Monash, too, will not be
allowed to get away again with profit-
ing financially through claiming money
for a greater number of students than
it intends to accept. The establish-
ment of new courses must now be
approved if they are to attract Federal
money.
For the first time the Universities
Report was tabled in Parliament at the
same time as the report of the New
Commonwealth Committee on Colleges
of Advanced Education. These diploma-
granting technological institutes will be
given a strong boost, the Government
having agreed almost in full with
recommendations. Overall expenditure
will rise from the s2Bm. of 1964-6 to
almost sloom. in the coming three
years. Enrolments will have more than
doubled by 1970 and the foundations
laid for a new system of tertiary educa-
tion.
Finally, it is now clear that the Gov-
ernment is developing the Australian
Research Grants Committee into a
major institution for supervising the
use of research monies, and that the
Universities will not have things so
easy. They will continue to get more
money each three years, but not to the
detriment of the technology colleges,
and both will be more closely super-
vised in the way they make use of
public money.

An Administrative Garrison
Canberra growing by inexorable logic
There was hardly a murmur last week when the Government released a r'eport
which mentioned the possibility of Canberra growing to a population of over a third
of a million by the end of the 19705.
•This is a projection by Lord Holford,
a leading British architect and. town-
planner who is on contract to the
National Capital Development Com-
mission as a consultant planner. Hol-
ford’s figure, which would involve a
quadrupling of the present population,
is generally thought to be too high.
But it might not be much too high, for
there is now a certain inexorable logic
about the city’s growth.
In the middle of the Menzies era
it was at the mercy of the Prime
Ministerial whim. The last two budgets
have been tough ones for Canberra. The
1965 one saw the suspension of public
service transfers from Melbourne, and
the latest provides for virtually no new
arterial roadworks despite some quite
acute traffic congestion. The only new
so-called National capital projects
authorised in the two years have been
the landscaping of the approaches to
the War Memorial and a small monu-
ment to the desert mounted corps.
The proposed National Art Gallery
and the new Parliament House build-
ing are still in the hands of investiga-
tory committees, actual construction
being many years off. Despite the
stringency at this level, capital expen-
ditures have risen, being absorbed in
providing essential services.
Canberra’s first satellite district,
Woden Valley, south-west over the
Red Hill ridge, is now r almost com-
pletely serviced with the mass of
expensive pipes, kerbs, and roadways
needed to house a population of 80,000.
In the north-west of Canberra work
is getting under way on serving for
the second satellite, Belconnen, which
will accommodate 120,000 by the time
it is filled some time late next decade,
By next year work will be finished on
a major reservoir and mains system
to provide a water supply for a popula-
tion of 200,000.
This is the con text in which Hol-
ford’s report was made. He thinks the
continuation of Canberra’s growth
highly desirable, taking up Donald
Horne’s claim that the city is “an
administrative garrison beautified by
k a power comp l ex of officials
f , r r . A \ , „
isolated from the Australian people,
. r
He P° int , s out tha * as a metropolitan
ox tbe slze ox P er th or Adelaide
xt wou ld be so much an integral part
national development and life that
b wou ld finally cease to be thought
as rem °te and resistant to change,
To this the Development Commission
adds the claim that it is able, through
its concentrated, continuous planning,
t 0 provide the expensive essentials of
roads, schools, water, power, and
sewerage more cheaply than anywhere
e^se xn Australia.
Government departments, it seems
clear > are better concentrated in Can-
berra, close to one another so that
in ? v , itable inter - departmental com-
mittees can meet, and close to Parlia-
ment, too. It is rather inefficient, for
instance, for the Minister for Labor
and National Service, Mr. Leslie Bury,
living in Sydney, to have his parlia-
mentary and cabinet work mostly in
Canberra and his department in Mel-
bourne, and for the Department of
Supply to be separated by 500 miles
from the military departments it i s
supposed to be supplying. Private busi-
ness and commerce are finding the city
attractive and they provide more of the
push each year.
If Holford went along with the
general policy of Canberra develop-
ment, he had some suggestions for im-
proving the detail. He lent support
tactfully to those who have criticised
the city’s mediocre architecture, point-
ing out that there is not a single build-
ing of international architectural in-
terest. He called for greater boldness:
for instance, the Commission should be
prepared to utilise the beautiful lakes
setting more fully, permitting clusters
of office blocks right down on the
water’s edge in places. Big building
projects could be opened to foreign
architects. Far more attention would
be needed to ensure that the focal
Parliament House and government
offices area did not become a Washing-
ton-like chaos through inadequate plan-
ning for traffic and parking.
PETER SAMUEL
Campus
Hospital
A new concept of hospitals may be
introduced to Australia through a Bill
on its way through the Western Aus-
tralian Parliament. The scheme will set
off work on a hospital complex that
plans to rationalise all aspects of Perth’s
medicine within one huge campus-style
organisation.
The State’s Health Minister, Mr.
Graham MacKinnon, has thrown him-
self into the scheme since taking the
portfolio, but acknowledges that it is a
gamble. For critics within the medical
world believe it will guarantee institu-
tionalised thinking for the next genera-
tion of doctors, whose job should be to
communicate with and educate people,
rather than patch them up and send
them back.
“If this takes place, we’ll have
failed,” Mr. MacKinnon says. “The
whole concept is designed to put medi-
cine into its proper social relationship.
We hope this will be a happy marriage
between teaching and general practice.
We think it can, at one and the same
time, have strong links with the com-
munity through general practice, pro-
vide facilities for teaching, and have a
place for specialisation.”
Hub of the scheme will be a 700-800
bed hospital with what Professor Eric
Saint, who has been one of the prime
movers, describes as “a tight centre.
This will be the tower block, with a
high density of patients needing highly
sophisticated medical care. From this
will fan out a series of buildings for
outpatients, people needing rehabilita-
tion and long-term nursing, psychiatric


"That's a help! Now we know where the police are, let's rob some shops."
unit, geriatrics centre, and so on—build-
ings with a more domestic style of archi-
tecture to fit their different function.
So far the university has set aside 70
acres of its land and earmarked $8
million for the campus, and the first
step will come early next year with a
nurses’ training school. The concept
developed when it became obvious that
the medical school which Professor
Saint headed—was fast outgrowing its
quarters. The proposed medical teach-
ing centre within the complex will have
epartments of medicine, surgery,
psychiatry, pathology and micro-
biology; there will be Health Depart-
ment laboratories, an enlarged radio-
therapy institute, and eventually a
dental school and private hospital.
The only areas of medicine not
accommodated in the plan are obstetrics
and children’s hospital, and these are
already within about a mile of the pro-
posed campus
Will such a monolith tend to regi-
ment doctors who learn and practise
"ithin it, enlarging the gulf between
the profession and the people they tend?
A number of medical people believe that
it will, and that the centre is outdated
before it is started. But those who have
created the plan say it wall become a
pacemaker.
Because GPs will be encouraged to
work both inside and on the periphery
°f the hospital campus, it will strengthen
rather than weaken the medicine-lay
links, they say. “We are pinning our
faith on this to the extent of at least
$33 million,” says Mr. MacKinnon.
Mr. MacKinnon’s faith must have
been shaken last week when the W.A.
Legislative Council ruled his Bill out
of order on a constitutional technicality.
He has moved to disagree with the
ruling, but if the ruling is upheld the
Bill and work on the centre could be
delayed for up to 12 months.
Jay, oh Jay
No one can blame Mr. Douglas Jay,
the first British Trade Minister ever
to visit Australia, for trying to
encourage us to buy more British
goods. And there is every reason to
commend him for trying to create a
feeling of injustice over the fact that
we place more tariffs on British goods
coming here than Britain places on
our goods going there.
The fact that the proposition simply
does not wash that Australia gives
far greater preferences to British com-
panies than Britain gives to Australian
exporters, that the extent of the
alleged “injustice” is such that British
exports to Australia have almost
doubled in value in the past 16 years
while our exports to the “free” British
market have risen only by 12 percent
in that time, and that many of the
companies standing to benefit from our
tariff policies are subsidiaries of British
companies all of these facts in no
way reduce the marks that Mr. Jay
should be awarded for trying.
It is also refreshing to see a British
Minister who comes here and speaks
his mind, has some controversial words
to say, takes a crack at Jack McEwen,
and reminds us in strong terms that
we are very dependent on Britain for
lots of things (even for the inflow of
capital, despite the stout efforts of his
Government).
That is where the good marks end.
For there are sinister overtones in Mr.
Jay’s visit that, hopefully, have not
gone unnoticed in Canberra.
In last week’s speech to the Australian
British Trade Association, Mr. Jay said
very strongly indeed that the different
tariff treatment British goods receive in
Australia to that given Australian goods
in Britain “cannot be justified.” In a
very significant sentence he added: “If
it continues it is likely to strengthen the
arguments of those in Britain, of whom
I am not one, who want to purchase
100 percent free entry for British goods
into the European Common Market at
the price of imposing new barriers to
Australia’s food imports into Britain.”

to drop our tariffs against British goods
aS a quid pro quo for Britain staying
oU t of the Common Market he may as
we ll not have come at all.
The realities of the situation are that
Britain buys most of her imports of
Australian raw materials (with the
notable exception of sugar) at world
market rates, and she buys them be-
cause she needs them. If she joins the
Common Market, she will be forced to
place duties against our products that
will make them dearer for her to buy.
At present something like 99 percent of
our exports to Britain have no tariffs
placed against them. The reason' for
this is not that we are especially be-
loved. It is because there are sound
commercial reasons for Britain buying
raw materials (which make up 80 per-
cent or so of our exports to Britain) at
the cheapest possible prices.
Commercial reasons clearly dominate
British importing policies, which may
help to explain why we have done so
badly in Britain since the war; so com-
mercial reasons can be the only factors
prompting any change in our buying
habits from Britain.
But if Mr. Jay wants us to buy
British he should drop the Common
Market stick and do something to im-
prove the quality, price, delivery time,
and after-sales service of British goods
sold to Australia.

The Bank and the Liberals
Nothing makes the Liberal pulse quicken like the cry of nationalised banking,
and the latest stir in the Queensland Liberal Party has been caused by this hardy
perennial. On the face of it the issue was far from major.
The agreement between the State
Government and the Commonwealth
Savings Bank whereby the Bank had
a monopoly of banking services in
Queensland State schools had come up
for review, and the Liberal Right-wing
ginger group took it as an opportunity
to whack their seniors for diluting the
pure milk of Liberalism.
The agreement had originally been
negotiated by a Labor Government, and
it would not have been surprising for
the Nicklin Government to have thrown
school banking open to the commercial
banks. But, in return for the monopoly,
the Bank gives the State Government
concessional interest rates worth, it is
claimed, $1.7 million a year, and assists
the Queensland Housing Commission
with $3 million credit a year plus
another $3 million in semi-government
debenture raisings. The commercial
banks declined to match these conces-
sions, and so the Treasurer and Liberal
leader, Gordon Chalk, agreed to another
20 years of Commonwealth monopoly.
Early last month the State Council
of the Liberal Party debated a reso-
lution affirming opposition to Common-
wealth monopoly of school banking. The
policy had been declared at the State
Conference in March. Mr. Chalk and
ministerial colleagues spoke strongly
against it, and the motion was lost. But
shortly afterwards the State President,
Dr. Hartwig, attacked the Bank for
“economic blackmail” of the State
Government and transferred his personal
account to a commercial bank, point-
ing out that failure to affirm the policy
did not negate it either.
The chairman of the Clayfield Elec-
torate Council, Mr. C. A. Coombs,
chimed in with a letter to the “Courier-
Mail” in which he accused the Bank of
threatening to withhold “a sizable
amount of the people’s savings” (the
Commonwealth has almost two-thirds of
Queensland savings), over $2 million.
Mr. Coombs went on to ask what right
the Bank had to dictate the State Gov-
ernment’s education policy, and de-
clared that it all savored of facelcss-
men-ism, with the Bank prepared to pay
a “tremendous price” for an oppor-
tunity of brainwashing the kiddies,
Unfortunately, Mr. Coombs’ rhetoric
proved sounder than his reportage, for
he attributed the cry to “economic
blackmail’ to “the State Liberal Party
leader,” and this brought Mr. Chalk
into the letter columns denying that
>3f ha d said | it and disposing of Mr
Coombs as a memb « ° f t . he „ S,al ! r , of

, e of ant i. Ba nk cartoons and one
of T standard On-the-one-hand-but-on-
the.other editori als, but most of the
running was made by the Murray-
Porter group of Liberal backbenchers,
The nucleus of the group had been
three backbenchers> Mr. John Murray,
Premier Nicklin - getting with the
strength.
MLA for Clayfield and a one-term
MHR, and Messrs. Lickiss (Mt. Coot-
tha) and Chinchen (Mt. Gravatt),
sometimes augmented .by ex-Alderman
Clive Hughes (Kurilpa). In the pre-
vious Parliament most of their atten-
tion had concentrated dn land policy
and the incompatibility of Queens-
land’s traditional emphasis on lease-
holding with Liberal principles of free-
holding. At the State election this year
the ginger group backed up the State
Executive’s experiment with three-
cornered contests, and at one stage
were thought likely to push against
Mr. Chalk’s leadership as too soft on
the Country Party. Their number was
augmented by the election of the
State Secretary of the Party, Charles
Porter, a known hard-liner, together
with several other new MLAs thought
likely to be more committed to Liberal-
ism than the prospects of office.
When the necessary legislation was
introduced it passed the first reading
(not a formal stage in Queensland) only
after a four-hour debate in which Mr.
Murray claimed that in 1963 the Com-
monwealth Bank had refused to enter
a new banking agreement with the
State Government unless it was prom-
ised the school banking monopoly, and
that the former Treasurer, Sir Thomas
Hiley, had been compelled to surrender
upder duress and signed the agreement
which Parliament could now approve or
reject but could not amend.
Mr. Chalk explained that the Gov-
ernment had to choose between its
political philosophy and the interest of
Queensland, and had decided on the
balance where the merit lay. He re-
sented as attacks on his integrity, and
Sir Thomas Hiley’s, suggestions that
Parliament and the Government parties’
caucus had been presented with a fait
accompli.
At the second reading on September
20, the debate became even more
heated.
Commercial banks had tied-banking
agreements with other schools; he did
not criticise tied business, but he did
object to the holier-than-thou attitude
of some backbenchers.
Mr. Murray moved that the bill be
referred to a select committee, but
the motion was defeated 63-6 with the
ALP and independent members sup-
porting the Government. Messrs.
Murray, Porter, Chinchen, Lickiss, and
Hughes were joined by one other
Liberal, Mr. Miller (Ithaca), but the
striking thing is not that there were so
many rebels but that they were so few.
The country Party member for Albert,
Mr. Carey, who had nearly been a vic-
tim of a Liberal push, declared that it
might be another attempt to break up
the coalition, until he was shushed by
the Speaker who had survived his
three-cornered contest rather more com-
fortably. Mr. Chalk, winding up the
Rebate, referred to the need for team
spirit and loyalty as the basis of demo-
cratic government which, considering
this has been the first sign of life in
Parliament for a year, is a bit hard.

OVERSEAS
Doing the Bung’s Work
As British troops steadily withdraw from Sarawak, the Malaysian Federal
Government in Kuala Lumpur is taking swift and drastic action to end an acute
political crisis which aroused much-publicised fears of bloodshed and Communist
exploitation.
A fortnight ago Dr. Ismail, Minister
for Home Affairs of the young Com-
monwealth Federation that includes the
sprawling, under-populated North
Borneo territories, announced a state
of emergency in Sarawak. This was to
justify, in turn, a Bill, rushed through
the Federal Parliament, which tempor-
arily amends the constitution in order
to enable the Governor of Sarawak to
dismiss the State’s Dyak Chief Minister,
Mr. Stephen Kalong Ningkan.
The curious constitutional squabble
which these moves are designed to end
developed after Ningkan displeased the
ruling Malaysian Alliance in Kuala
Lumpur last March by sacking a
Minister who had been among its most
loyal friends and followers at State
level. Three other Sarawak Minister'
resigned in protest, and in mid-June
Tunku Abdul Rahman, the
Malaysian Premier, declared
that Ningkan was to be re-
lieved of office, as he had not
discharged his duties “to the
credit of the Alliance party."
The State Governor accord-
ingly dismissed Ningkan and
appointed a more amenable
Dyak named Tawi Sli in his
place.
Ningkan then took the
matter to court, claiming that
the Governor had acted un-
constitutionally, that he was,
therefore, still Chief Minister
of Sarawak, and so Tawi Sli should
be restrained from behaving as if he
were. In early September the acting-
chief Justice found in favor of Ningkan.
Ningkan was in again, Tawi Sli out.
Ningkan had meanwhile withdrawn
his Sarawak National Party from the
Sarawak Alliance coalition, whose
other factions in the legislature had
rebelled against Ningkan with the ap-
proval and solid support of the Malay-
sian Alliance Government in Kuala
Lumpur. The two Alliances—one at
Federal level, the other at State level
—now demanded that Ningkan resign
at once or call a meeting of the Coun-
cil Negri (State Parliament) at which
a vote of confidence would be taken.
They were on firm ground, for
although Ningkan legally remained
Chief Minister, certain waverers in the
legislature had been discreetly induced
f° join the rebellion against him, and
in consequence 25 Alliance members
out of a council of 42 had repudiated
Ningkan in formal letters to the
Governor. Ningkan refused to summon
Parliament, objecting that it no longer
reflected the will of the electorate, and
Dato Ningkan
demanded that general elections be held
to put his mandate to a fair and
democratic test. However, Sarawak is
at present subject to an outmoded
three-tier system of indirect elections,
whereby members of the Council
Negri are chosen by the adviser coun-
cils of the State’s five “divisions,” or
provinces, which in turn consist of
representatives drawn from bodies
elected at still lower levels. The elec-
toral rolls are also absurdly out of
date, and it is generally conceded that
direct general elections cannot be held
before March, 1967.
Last week this deadlock was accom-
panied by a series of reports, incidents,
and statements well calculated to create
an atmosphere of alarm beginning
with an announcement that police
guards had been provided for
all members of the Sarawak
Alliance, because they had
received telephone threats to
kidnap them. Although Chief
Minister Ningkan was not
allowed to use the State’s in-
formation and radio services
for political purposes for
fear of further trouble, as the
Federal Minister for Informa-
lion explained.
In Kuala Lumpur officials
repeatedly stressed how ex-
plosive the situation was. The
ground laid, the state of
emergency was declared. Ningkan then
urged that the advisory councils of
the five Sarawak divisions which had
elected the Council Negri should be
asked to say whether its members still
had their confidence and to decide
whether elections should be held. Ning-
kan believed that four out of the five
of the councils would back him. But
Kuala Lumpur has responded by push-
ing through the Bill that will give the
Governor absolute discretion to summon
the existing Council Negri which
will duly vote Ningkan out on a
motion of no confidence, and Tawi
Sli back in. Opposition parties have
used harsh language against the
Malaysian Alliance, accusing the
Government of simulating a state of
danger to justify high-handed Federal
interference in Sarawak’s State affairs
and of undemocratically tinkering with
the constitution to suit its own political
ends.
Kuala Lumpur’s nervous reaction is
nevertheless understandable. Ningkan is
now openly supported by the moderate
leadership of the progressive and
“nationalist” Sarawak United People’s

Party (SUPP), whose left-wing
extremists among the Chinese and Dyak
membership touch fingers with the
Clandestine Communist Organisation.
The CCO is believed to have several
hundred armed terrorists hidden away
in the jungles of Sarawak, 1000 hard-
core cadres, and several thousand sup-
porters.
Of Sarawak’s sparse population of
about 800,000 people, more than
300,000 are Dyaks, and about 250,000
are Chinese. Malays constitute only
about 18 percent of the total. For the
predominantly Malay Federal Govern-
ment in Kuala Lumpur to take over this
territory from the British has been a
delicate process, and today it has also
become a delicate military process, for
with “confrontation” officially at an
end Britain is pulling out her 10,000
combat troops in the Borneo territories,
and they are being replaced largely by
Malay battalions. One-third of the
British force has already been with-
drawn, and most of it will be out by
November.
It remains to be seen whether the
Federal Government’s somewhat dis-
concerting moves to “defend democ-
racy” in Sarawak are going to diminish
the risks of Communist exploitation by
the CCO and a general outbreak of
political disorders or increase them.
Some observers believe that the left-
wing SUPP and Ningkan’s Sarawak
National Party might, between them,
win the general elections, which must
in any case be held early next year to
satisfy Indonesia's demand for self-
determination in the North Borneo
States.
The Government of Malaysia, which
was formed as an expanded Federation
just three years ago, has already ejected
Singapore, engineered the removal of
one elected chief minister in Sabah, and
of another now in Sarawak. Sukarno
mobilised 21 million “volunteers” and
wrecked the economy of Indonesia in
an effort to destroy Malaysia. Some of
Malaysia’s friends now fear that the
day may come when he will realise that
he might as well have saved himself all
the trouble.
DENNIS BLOODWORTH
Is Mao a Stalinist?
“Our great leader . . . the great supreme commander . . . our great teacher
helmsman . . . the red sun that shines in our hearts.” All this, and much more
about Mao’s thought-moving mountains, is strikingly reminiscent of Stalin’s cult
at its most byzantine.
Some of the attacks on “bourgeois
survivals” in this so-called cultural
revolution make the late Andrei
Zhdanov seem in retrospect like a
broad-minded Liberal. Yet it would be
wrong to dismiss Maoism simply as a
Chinese version of Stalinism. In the •
search for the meaning of the unfinished
upheaval in China the differences are
probably even more instructive than
the similarities.
One parallel is obvious. Both systems
have similar roots. Both stem from the
conflict between the sophisticated
Marxist tools, designed for the
industrialised countries of western
Europe, and the backward eastern
soils in which they have been used.
Stalinism was not just the whim of the
Georgian tyrant. It was the by-pro-
duct of what has been described (by
Preobrazhensky) as “primitive socialist
accumulation,” the rapid industrialisa-
tion of a country in which a large
majority of the people were poor
muzhiks. Maoism has developed in an
even more backward peasant country,
in which accumulation must therefore
be an even more painful process. But
the reactions to this similar environ-
ment of backwardness and isolation
seem to differ.
Stalin rose to power as the party
boss, the manipulator of the machine.
He established a stratified hierarchial
society, with big social differences and
a chain of command starting from the
very top. He mistrusted the masses too
much to indulge in purges from below.
The aged Mao Tse-tung, on the other
hand, has given an entirely new twist
to his system. Clearly he is thinking
of the future, and the succession. He is
taking the risk of letting the younger
generation loose and he is ostensibly
doing so not for the sake of preserving
privilege but in order to suppress it.
In mood, the new phase of the
Chinese revolution resembles the period
of “war Communism” in Russia, when
the “Red Guards,” as the revoluntary
troops were then called, were seeking a
short cut, rifle in hand, to a Communist
society; when they were trying to
impose equality in the half-starving
Russia of the civil war. China’s Red
Guards, the students who form the
shock troops of the cultural revolution,
behave like latter-day levellers, attack-
ing “national capitalists,” urging the
abolition of interest rates, opposing any
form of privileged distinction.
The link with the army confuses
things. The connection between the
Chinese Red Guards and China’s army
is plain, not only because the move-
ment is directed by the new heir-
apparent, Marshal Lin Piao, but also
because many references have been
made publicly to the need for the Red
Guards to act under the guidance and
control of the army. Mao’s army, how-
ever, should not be confused with the
instrument that Stalin forged on the
eve of World War 11. It was then that
the Russian Army recovered its ranks,
its glittering epaulets, and the patriotic
cult of those eminent pre-Marxists
Kutuzov and Suvorov. The Chinese
Army, on the other hand, claims to be
what Russia’s Red Guards were in 1918:
a disciplined and egalitarian band of
Communists in unadorned uniforms.
More complex differences can be
discovered in the interconnected issues
of nationalism, internationalism, and
isolation. There is an element of
national pride in China’s challenge to
the world and in Peking’s self-appointed
role as the capital of world revolution.
The Western Press and Russia’s have
insisted on the xenophobic features of
the current movement. In fairness it
must be added that foreigners are not
attached as such but because they either
are, or were, “imperialists” or because
they are “revisionist accomplices.” And
whereas, in the hour of danger Stalin
invoked the national spirit of Mother
Russia, the central feature of China’s
cultural revolution is the attempt, which,
occasionally reaches ridiculous propor-
tions, to make a clean break with the
past.
China is now almost as isolated as
Red Guards - Maoist cultism.
Russia was before the war. But Stalin,,
who rose to power as the apostle of
“Socialism in one country,” felt in his
element in this isolation. For him,
foreign Communist Parties were mere
tools. He would never allow them to
indulge in revolutionary antics which
could in any' way endanger the
“Socialist fatherland.” Mao, on the
other hand, still sticks to the inter-
nationalist message of the early bolshe-
viks. He does not tell the Vietnamese
or the Cubans to keep quiet for the
sake of China. On the contrary, he
accuses Moscow of doing just this. In-
deed, if Stalin were alive, he would be
bewildered to learn that his picture is
being carried triumphantly through the
streets of Peking, that his Russian suc-
cessors are being violently criticised for
pursuing his policies, and that his
Chinese admirers are echoing the
revolutionary slogans of his arch-enemy
Trotsky.
Mao’s refusal to exploit specific
nationalist traditions is the more sig-
nificant since the new phase of the
Chinese revolution may well one day
be described as “war Communism” in
more senses than one. One possible
partial explanation of what is now hap-
pening is that the Chinese are getting
ready for war. Rightly or wrongly, the
Chinese leaders seem to think that the
Vietnamese war is likely to develop into
a Sino-American conflict. Rightly or
wrongly, they seem to assume that
Russia could just stand by and watch.


COMMONWEALTH BANKING CORPORATION
Combined Assets and Liabilities of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation and its constituent hanks as at
30th June, 1966.
COMMONWEALTH TRADING BANK OF AUSTRALIA
The business of the Commonwealth Trading Bank grew appreciably during 1965/66.
Deposits increased by $77 million and totalled $923 million in June, 1966.
New loans approved rose considerably and were well spread over industrial, commercial, rural and social
undertakings. In particular, substantial assistance was directed to the rural sector to offset the effects of the drought
in some areas and to promote increased productivity generally.
Total advances outstanding increased by $52 million.
The services of the C.T.B. are now available at 1,062 branches and agencies, or 43 more than a year earlier.
1965/66 profit after tax $2,550,264
COMMONWEALTH SAVINGS BAN K OF AUSTRALIA
The highlight of 1965/66 was a record volume of lending for housing. New loans approved during the year
amounted to $127 million, an increase of $l5 million over 1964/65.
Since 1946, the Commonwealth Savings Bank has assisted over 200,000 families obtain their own homes. At
the same time, loans have been made for essential community services such as roads, electricity, water and sewerage.
The Bank’s deposits grew by $126 million. This was the fifth consecutive year deposits increased by more
than $lOO million. At 30th June, 1966 depositors’ balances totalled $2,325 million.
At 30th June, 1966 the Commonwealth Savings Bank conducted 6,346,000 active accounts. This represented
a net increase of 226,000 accounts for the year.
The Bank’s Personal Credit Service continued to expand. Loans were made to 15,577 depositors for essential
personal needs and totalled $6 million.
Commonwealth Savings Bank services are available at over 9,000 branches and agencies.
1965/66 profit $8,841,086
COMMONWEALTH DEVELOPMENT BANK OF AUSTRALIA
The Commonwealth Development Bank, which provides financial assistance to primary and secondary
industries for projects designed to increase production or productivity, does not compete with conventional and
traditional lenders, but provides help where, in the opinion of the Bank, such help is desirable and the finance would
not otherwise be available on reasonable and suitable terms and conditions.
The Commonwealth Development Bank experienced strong demand for term loan and equipment finance
and $87.7 million was approved during 1965/66. Since its establishment in 1960 the Development Bank has approved
financial assistance totalling $408.4 million and its activities play a significant part in the growth of the national economy.
At 30th June, 1966 balances outstanding totalled $172.5 million.
1965/66 profit $2,198,018

They may, therefore, envisage that
their country might be disrupted by-
bombing and that central control might
collapse. Mao may have concluded
that neither the patriotic spirit nor
the Party hierarchy would be enough
to carry on resistance on a national
scale in such circumstances. The revolu-
tionary spirit would be needed; and he
has called on the Red Guards to re-
vive it.
It is in manner and method that the
divergence between Stalin and Mao is
most striking. Stalin eliminated his
rivals and then embarked on a mass
purge of the Party w'ith the aid of the
mighty secret police. Mao also has to
rope with a major struggle within the
Party. If repeated references to “those
persons in power who have wormed
their way into the Party and are taking
the capitalist road” did not drive the
point home, the downgrading of Liu
Shao-chi, for so long the acknowledged
heir, would be proof enough. Yet,
instead of the secret police, Mao has
thrown the Red Guards, sponsored by
Lin Piao, into battle.
It looks as if Mao Tse-tung, having
allowed his lieutenants to run the show'
for a time, did not like the result;
he returned to impose a new line and
met with resistance from part of the
Party establishment. To break this
opposition, he embarked on a purge
from below', relying on the radical spirit
of the younger generation. But such a
movement runs the risk of getting out
of hand. The reported clashes between
Red Guards and workers led by Party
officials, whatever their real scale, are
an illustration of both the dangers and
the division.
But who against whom about w'hat?
It is here that the mysteries still sur-
rounding the Chinese revolution make
.comparisons difficult. In Russia one
knew that Stalin was driven tow'ard
collectivisation by the difficulties of
getting food supplies from the country-
side. One knew' that Trotsky stood for
rapid industrialisation, Bukharin for a
“snail’s pace,” and that Stalin hovered
between the two positions. The Chinese
are now urged to fight against “demons
and monsters” without being given
much idea w'hat they look like.
Are the “national capitalists” really
a threat to the Communist control of
the economy? Can the former rich
peasants really exercise enough in-
fluence within the communes to justify
appeals to the “poorer and medium”
peasants? Or is it just routine, a
Stalinist smokescreen concealing a more
complex struggle within the leader-
ship over the pace of industrial trans-
formation, the bearable limits of capi-
tal accumulation, and the allocation of
resources —as well as over the allied
subjects of the risks to be run in Viet-
nam and the line to be taken in the
international Communist movement?
The answers to these questions will
probably emerge only gradually; the
Chinese leaders have proclaimed that
their new- revolution w'ill last a long
time and will take a zig-zag path.
Divine Right of Vorster
“The National Party,” South Africa’s new Prime Minister said last summer, “i s
clear. In this Parliament, which must decide the fate of the Republic of South
Africa and its inhabitants, the white man and the white man alone will have the
right to sit.
“This is not because the National
Party is hostile to any group, but
because it is its God-given right to
control what belongs to it . . . because
it believes that this nation must main-
tain its identity.”
John Vorster never equivocates. He
was born 51 years ago at Jamestown in
the north-eastern Cape near the scene
of what white history books call the
“Kaffir Wars” between Boer and Bantu.
Even today, in those parts, the attitudes
to color are those of the frontier, and
Vorster is essentially a frontiersman: his
politics are not intellectual, like Ver-
woerd’s, but physical. With his heavy-
charm and his cruelty, he is cast as
his country’s Goering, chosen to succeed
the murdered Dr. Verwoerd for his
determination to maintain white sup-
remacy with ruthless force.
Vorster was the thirteenth child and
grew up dirt-poor, intelligent, and
sensitive to the slights he felt were put
upon his people by the well-to-do and
patronising English. He studied
law and did well at it. He
became an advocate, but his
real interest was always Afri-
kaner politics. His anti-British
militancy as a young man was
never in doubt.
In 1942, w'hen he was 27.
he was arrested and detained
wnthout trial for being a
“general” in the pro-Nazi ter-
rorist i Stormjaers —the break-
away stormtroopers of the
Ossewabrandwag (the Ox-wag-
gon Sentinels). This group be-
lieved in committing acts of
sabotage against the South African
Army and Government property. Some
of their members were accused of acts
of violence which resulted in death.
He still talks constantly about his
war-time ordeal. Any reporter can
rattle off his identity registration
Internee No. 2229/42, Hut 48, Camp
1, Koffiefontein. He is still surrounded
by souvenirs.
Poachers often make good game-
keepers, and Vorster is no exception.
The new laws and punishments he has
devised in the past five years since
he became Minister of Justice mirror
and refine his own war-time restraints.
The cage set up on Robben Island for
African political leaders is said to be
exactly the same size as the barbed-wire
enclosure he himself lived in at Koffie-
fontein. His Sabotage Act of 1962 pro-
vided for house arrest. The following
year he introduced 90-day detention
without trial, extended in 1965 to 180
days. But when vs Vorster’s own deten-
tion had been preventive, that of his
present victims is punitive. Solitary
Mr. B. J. Vorster
confinement, non-stop interrogations
electric shock torture are among the
weapons he has countenanced.
But Vorster’s main contribution j s
to have given South Africa some of
the world’s most efficient security,
especially through the police. He took
office just when the African and other
anti-apartheid groups, frustrated and
embittered by 13 years of “separate
development,” were switching to
violence. To crush these movements
Poqo, the Spear of the Nation, thp
African Resistance Movement—Vorster
built up his own private security system
to spy and check on the regular security-
forces.
His had been a rapid ascent to the
pinnacle of power. His record is that
of a tough, implacable man, so little
emotionally involved in his actions that
he can have a man hanged without
rancour and, apparently, without guilt.
He acts “in the interests of
the State,” calmly executing
the tasks assigned to him by
Providence.
By one of those twists of
human nature, he is also
capable of great kindness. He
is sincerely interested in
people who have served prison
sentences. Most of his ser-
vants are ex-convicts and his
present cook served a prison
sentence for murder. Appar-
ently his family do not mind.
His wife is herself intensely
political. He has a daughter
at his old university, Stellenbosch, and
two schoolboy sons.
Vorster goes through life unsmiling
with a slow, deliberate almost menacing
walk. He is a short, burly man run-
ning to fat. He suffers from high blood
pressure and, because of this, prefers
to travel in his Cadillac rather than
go by air. He has only once left
South Africa —on a convalescent voyage
to South America. His speech is not
without wit, though it often seems to
have a suppressed sadism about it.
What is true of his speeches will
be sombrely true of his life and his
Premiership. He admits to hating any-
thing which smacks of Liberalism, Com-
munism, or multi-racialism and equates
the three. He is unyielding and merci-
less. He lacks Verwoerd’s subtlety and
suppleness, but like him he is patient,
not impulsive. He has said he will
follow in Verwoerd’s path and he will
do so—because it is the path beaten
out by the Broederbond, the Dutch
Reformed Church, and the National
Party—the triune power which controls
Afrikanerdom and, in the last resort,
will control Balthazar John Vorster.

1966 —The Year of the Air Crash
A British View of the Air Toll
From ANDREW WILSON in London
THURSDAY’S disaster in which 24
people were killed in an Ansett-
ANA Viscount crash in Queens-
land makes 1966 one of the blackest
years yet in airline history. This is par-
ticularly tragic because until this Janu-
ary there had been for four years a
steady improvement throughout the
world in the safety record. Then came
the Air India disaster killing 117 people
on Mont Blanc, followed a few days
later by the Air Nippon disaster in
Tokyo Bay, killing 133, the BOAC crash
over Mount Fuji, killing 124, and in
September the crash in which 95
British holiday makers were killed near
Ljubljana, Yugoslavia. They were only
five out of 16 major disasters already
this year almost one every fortnight.
At the end of last week over 960 people
had died in crashes this year, including
crews. In addition about 24 people had
been killed in executive and private
aircraft in Britain alone.
Whatever may have happened in
Queensland and Australia’s airline
record is very good international air-
lines tend to justify their record
by reference to the steady growth of
air traffic, now 15 percent a year, and
by reckoning safety in terms of
fatalities per passenger mile. Until re-
cently they would point to 1965 the
"safest” year on record when
fatalities worked out at 0.54 per 100
million passenger miles flown. On this
basis, flying was claimed to be twice as
safe as travelling by road. But what
was the truth of the matter?
A IR -SAFETY experts have long re-
jected the airlines’ claims on two
grounds. First they say that the pas-
senger-mile basis gives only half the
picture: and that for many purposes
safety must be reckoned in terms of the
hours that the passenger is exposed to
risk. Another way of expressing the 1965
figures is that there was one fatality
every 13,300 flying hours; or one death
for every 270,000 passengers carried
safely.
Secondly, they reject the comparison
between air and road accident figures
because there is a big difference be-
tween paying for a ticket and being
transported safely from one place to
another and driving one’s own car
where the risks depend on one’s own
skill. They say that commercial avia-
tion should only be compared with com-
mercial surface transport; and on a
passenger-mile basis it works out six
to eight times more dangerous to fly
than to go by train or bus.
But there is something unreal, as well
as repugnant, about treating air
disasters on a mere statistical basis.
Unreal because, as the Swedish air-
safety expert, Mr. Bo Lundberg, has
pointed out, it is simply the growing
size and frequency of air disasters which
shocks people, and this is quite un-
related to the number of miles travelled
and similar considerations. Repugnant,
because of the human tragedy involved
in every disaster, and because every-
body knows that with more care and
greater investment of money many lives
that are now lost in air crashes could
be saved.
The first area in which more could
be done to improve flying safety is
the design of aircraft themselves. In
Britain every new aircraft must do
hundreds of hours of test flying before
receiving a certificate of airworthiness
from the Air Registration Board, a
ruthless body which does all in its
power to safeguard the public against
failure. In the United States the Federal
Aviation Authority is the responsible
body. Nevertheless, failures occur.
A classic example was the paper-
thin panels whose collapse caused the
crashes of the early Comets in which
99 people died. A more recent example
occurred in the crash of a tail-jet
Boeing 727 at Salt Lake City last
November, when as a result of a heavy
landing due to pilot error the (now
modified) undercarriage collapsed in a
way that severed the fuel line, causing a
fire which burned 42 passengers to
death in their seats.
It might be argued that had there
been a tradition of more elaborate
testing and longer development time
throughout the industry in general, these
faults, and others like them, might
have been rectified without the Iqss of
life.
Another safety design aspect is the
“sink rate” of modern jets, particularly
tail-jets like the Boeing 727, the
Trident, the BAC 1-11, and the Douglas
DC-9, with their small, sharply swept
wings. This means that when coming
in to land they may lose height more
rapidly than their predecessors, and the
margin for pilot error is correspondingly
reduced. In the hands of experienced
pilots, or with automatic landing (in-
corporated in the Trident), they are
as safe as any other jet aircraft. But
what will happen when, inevitably, they
come into operation with less experi-
enced pilots, or at airports without the
expensive modern landing aid neces-
sary to help them?
\yHEN an aircraft strikes the ground
during landing or immediately after
take-off (operations during which two
thirds of present-day accidents occur)
another series of design factors come
into question, affecting the ability of
passengers to survive the two big killers
impact-shock and fire. For years it
has been known, and elaborate tests by
the American FAA have confirmed it.
that hundreds of passengers die simply
through breaking their necks. The
safeguard against this is simple aft-
facing seats, which have long been
adopted by the world’s safest airline,
RAF Transport Command. Yet the
majority of commercial airlines still
refuse to fit them. In support of their
stand they have invoked a catalogue of
objections ranging from air-sickness to
simple “lack of passenger appeal.” But
the truth is that aft-facing seats require
a slight strengthening of the floor,
which costs about £5 a seat and a
minute flying-weight penalty. This the
world s airlines decline to accept. (Had
it been otherwise the majority of the
Manchester United football team might
never have perished, for those in aft-
facing seats in the February, 1958,
Munich disaster were saved.)
Last year, belatedly, the American
FAA and the Directorate of Flight
Safety at the Ministry of Aviation took
steps to improve standards of emer-
gency evacuation in crashes, ensuring
that all passengers can be evacuated in
two minutes. But in certain circum-
stances this is simply impossible in
many modern aircraft because of the
shortage of emergency exits. The ideal
of a door to every row of seats is im-
possible for structural reasons connected
with pressurisation at high altitude.
As a pilot wrote in the “Aeroplane”
recently, “the cases of passengers being
trapped alive and burnt to death in
aircraft in full sight of those outside
are too numerous ... We must have
the maximum number of doors pos-
sible, as opposed to the minimum you
can get away with . . . even if we have
to interfere with the cabin door, or
upset the seat pitch, or spend a mite
more on equipment maintenance.”
Another point made in the same
article was that in the VC 10, the

has to reach for a separate microphone
to speak to the passenger cabin, “mak-
ing it relatively impossible in many cir-
cumstances to transmit urgent mes-
sages.”
As even the least technically minded
air traveller must now be aware, the
biggest controversy of all surrounding-
fire danger on crash landing concerns
the use of the jet fuel known as JP-4,
which is more explosive and inflam-
mable than ordinary kerosine. Com-
mendably, all British airlines use kero-
sine, though it is slightly less efficient
and therefore more expensive. But
despite pressure from pilots and air-
safety experts the Government has de-
clined to set a world lead by stipu-
lating “kerosine only” as a condition
of licences to foreign operators using
U.K. airports presumably for fear of
diplomatic and commercial frictions.
Among the airlines still using JP-4 are
Air Canada, Sabena, and KLM. (Two
previous outstanding users Pan-
American and TWA —have now given
it up.)
Another major area in which much
could be done to tighten up air-safety
regulations is pilot fatigue. A few
weeks ago, under pressure from the
British Airline Pilots Association, the
Ministry of Aviation published pro-
posals for the further limitation of
flying hours. This long overdue (but
in the pilots’ view far from adequate)
reform is the result of aeromedical
investigations into the effect of jet as
opposed to piston-engined aircraft
flying, particularly the effect of cross-
ing East-West time zones which upset
the pilot’s (and passengers’) “meta-
bolic clock.”
QTHER factors at last being recog-
nised are the fatigue due to high-
altitude glare and temperature and pres-
sure changes. All these affect a pilot’s
power of decision-making, as was shown
some time ago in a study by the Ameri-
can Flight Safety Foundation, which is
financed by U.S. airlines. The study,
to determine the distribution of acci-
dents by the hour of the day in rela-
tion to possible exposure, indicated that
the period between 2 a.m. and 6 a.m.
was particularly bad, with nine to ten
times the average accident ratio; and
since the accident record shows that
early morning accidents are not appre-
ciably different from overall conditions,
it could be concluded that these acci-
dents resulted from factors other than
weather—in other words reduced alert-
ness and perception when the pilot’s
reflexes are at their lowest level.
But ironically the Ministry of Aviation
proposals are not due to come into
operation until next January. Nor do
they appear to lay down such important
matters as the minimum of rest a pilot
requires before duty, including the time
n takes him to get from home to the
airport, or the number of night flights
he may do in any one month both
°f them questions which pilots think
should have been asked before several
recent accidents.
(Air Traffic Controllers are also con-
cerned about fatigue in the control
tower under today’s exacting traffic
conditions, and a Canadian Air Traffic
Controller recently published a paper
on drills to combat what he called a
controller’s “declining powers of con-
centration.”)
Earlier this year pilots became worried
when the International Civil Aviation
Organisation, under pressure from air-
lines, approved a reduction in the lateral
separation between aircraft on the busy
North Altantic route from 120 nautical
miles to 90 a measure that would
have afforded some operating economies.
After the resistance of the pilots the
arrangement was called off but not
before a former FAA official had told
an American inquiry that for want of
modern navigation aids 34 out of every
1000 transatlantic jet flights strayed up
to 100 miles off course.
An even more radical move by pilots
was the refusal last year by the Inter-
national Pilots Association to make any
more night landings at Cairo Airport,
after an Egyptian Ilyushin crashed on
the same dangerous hillock which had
taken 119 lives in a Pakistan Inter-
national Airways Boeing 707 a few
months before. Among criticisms at
Cairo have been bad terrain, inadequate
landing aids and inadequate fire-fighting
equipment. But every pilot knows that
there are dozens more inadequate air-
ports in use by British and other air-
lines, such as Perpignan Airport, which
at the time of serious crashes in 1961
and 1963, killing a total of 74 people,
had no proper radar to safeguard air-
craft from the nearby high mountains.
There are at least four other areas
in which much more might have been
done in the past ten years to investigate
and eliminate accidents: the slush prob-
lem, which caused the Manchester
United crash; the danger of clear air
turbulence, which can break up a jet at
high altitude; the danger of lightning
strikes; and last but not least the grow-
ing menace of bombs placed in aircraft
by maniacs which experts say could
be detected if only the money were
available to develop the necessary
equipment.
Where does the blame lie?
N OT .. I think, with air-safety bodies,
including some airlines’ own safety
committees, who have worked strenu-
ously - often with inadequate re-
sources to-cut down the death roll.
Largely it lies with governments which,
while they' are prepared to spend hun-
dreds of millions of pounds on such
ventures as supersonic airliners, are
content to allocate air-safety research
funds in mere tens and hundreds of
thousands.
A telling instance occurred last year
when Mr. G. W. Stallibrass, Director
of Flight Safety at the Ministry of
Aviation, told the Society of Licensed
Aircraft Engineers and Technologists
that important studies of a possible
relationship between pre-take-off delays
and of subsequent accidents, and of
accidents that occurred soon after take-
off at night and in poor visibility, had
had to be suspended because of other
work.
More broadly, the failure to prevent
many accidents appears to arise from
an accumulation of little things the
reluctance of financially pressed air-
lines to put aircraft out of service for
minor modifications; over-reliance on
“fair weather” airports; the failure of
constructors to place certain instru-
ments in unmistakable positions; the
pressure apparently felt by some pilots
to take-off or land in only marginally
safe conditions when a diversion would
inconvenience their passengers, them-
selves, and dieir companies. Any of
these things, at a given time, might be
of small account. But sooner or later,
several coincide. When it happens,
another big disaster hits the headlines.
The,aviation industry, for one, can-
not afford to go on having big disasters.
Today the toll averages about 70 dead
per crash, with most aircraft having
between 40 and 140 seats. But in 18
months we shall have the first 250-seat
aircraft, and in four years the first
400-seat “jumbos.” By 1975 we shall
probably have 900-seaters. Mr. Lund-
berg has calculated that if the present
trend continues we shall have about
60,000 air fatalities a year by the end
of the century 5000 more than are
now killed each year on British and
American roads.
It would be tragic and ironical if
while so much effort is given to reduc-
ing road deaths, the rising toll of air
travellers were to replace them as the
symbol of man’s muddled priorities.

Instant Ecstasy
The Great Drug for the Great Society
By MALCOLM MUGGERIDGE
PERMISSIVE sex was bound to be
followed by permissive drugs
Marijuana Denied. In Britain
there has so far been little reputable
agitation, though one member of the
present government Lord Kennet
of the Dene has put in a
word for the lifting of restrictions on
marijuana, Indian hemp, or pot. Con-
trariwise, his colleague at the Home
Office has recently prohibited LSD
(lysergic acid diethylamide). In
America there is a strong movement, on
campuses especially, for free access to
LSD, which, its devotees claim, is non-
addictive and guaranteed to produce
instant ecstasy. Why sit on top of a
pillar like Simeon Stylites, or toil over
Prophetic Books like Blake, or put on a
hair-shirt like St. Augustine, when
sucking an LSD-soaked sugar lump or
piece of blotting paper will take you
effortlessly all the way there and back?
After all, we have our bread ready
cut, our vegetables sliced and peeled;
all our appetites, including sex, catered
for in carton containers. Why not, then,
our transcendental dreams likewise
facilitated? A puff, and we’re in
heaven, a suck, and, lo! the angels
are singing. It gives an extra dimen-
sion to the Playboy Clubs, with the
bunnies not even touching the earth
as they move to and fro floating,
radiant, and intangible.
L sr ? -takers, or acidheads, look upon
Aldous Huxley as a sort of John
the Baptist; a popular acidhead dive is
called Brave New World. Huxley bap-
tised with mescalin, but now there is
this larger psychedelic vision, which
already claims one martyr in Dr.
Timothy Leary apart, of course,
from those unnumbered and unnamed
who make lampshades or just sit on
their beds in psychiatric wards. Leary
was lecturer in clinical psychology at
Harvard until his experiments with
LSD caused a public scandal leading to
the termination of his contract. At
present he is contesting a sentence of
30 years’ imprisonment and a fine of
$30,000 for being in possession of a
small quantity of marijuana. On a
long-playing record one can hear the
Doctor expounding in a monotonous
voice (rather like Lenny Bruce’s, but
without any of his disgust and despair)
the life-enhancing possibilities of LSD.
Students, it seems, turn up in their
thousands to listen to him.
Another LSD advocate he was
Leary’s colleague at Harvard is Dr.
Richard Alpert. To him I am beholden
for details of an experiment conducted
at Harvard to determine whether the
transcendent experience reported dur-
ing psychedelic sessions was similar to
the mystical experience reported by
saints and famous religious mystics.
Twenty divinity students were selected,
and the experiment took place in a
small private chapel on a Good Friday.
In true scientific fashion, Dr. Alpert
tells us, “the investigator had devised a
checklist of nine criteria of a genuine
Christian revelatory or religious experi-
ence based on a careful analysis of
Christian literature.” Alas, he does not
disclose what the criteria were. Those
given a good dosage of psychedelic
chemical “experienced at least four of
the nine criteria,” and all were unani-
mous that they had never before been
so uplifted. Henceforth, I take it, they
will make a point of not being without
LSD on a Good Friday.
Dr. Alpert goes on to point out that
great changes may be anticipated in
religious institutions as, with the aid
of LSD, more and more people come to
have their own mystical visionary ex-
perience. “I would anticipate,” he
writes in “LSD,” by Richard Alpert
and Sidney Cohen, “that those religions
which still provide an opportunity for a
direct religious experience will find a
place for the psychedelic chemicals asp
the sacraments which I believe them to
be.” One imagines the scene: “This is
My lysergic acid diethylamide, take it
in remembrance of Me.” Logactil for
Logos, in the beginning was the drug
■ —will LSD, perhaps, solve the problem
of the empty pew? Served at com-
munion it would certainly swell the
congregation. “Religious institutions
with highly crystallised unbending
ritual,” Dr. Alpert anticipates, “will
ultimately close ranks and unite in
opposing the possibility of better
religious living through chemistry.” He
might well be right.
If LSD can enhance a Good Friday,
it can also, Dr. Alpert claims, restore
a marriage which has “lost the fresh-
ness and sense of discovery which keeps
a marriage a living, vital contact.” This
in summarised form, is the procedure
he recommends. Two single mattresses
are placed about six inches apart on the
floor, with each partner lying on one
of them, a guide sitting behind them
and a lighted candle on either side of
them. After ingestion of the psychedelic
chemical, familiar music is played in-
terspersed with readings by the guide.
An adaptation of the Tao Sutra by Dr.
Leary is considered an appropriate text.
As the chemical starts to take effect
the partners each look into a mirror
at his or her own face while the guide
at five-minute intervals repeats the
question: “Who am I?” subsequently
adjusted to: “Who else am I?” They
are then told to “Keep going behind
each face until you find your own calm
centre.”
JTOR the next stage the guide moves
one of the candles between the two
mattresses, extinguishes the other, and
takes away the mirror. The partners
are then told to look at one another
and see who he or she is, while the
guide repeats the question: “And who
else?” Then the guide says: “He is
all men. She is all women. Keep look-
ing behind each face until you find his
or her calm centre.” There follows the
third and last stage when the guide re-
moves the single remaining candle, joins
the hands of the couple, and says: “Now,
listen carefully to one another’s bodies.
Through their merging you shall find
a new calm centre.” He then exting-
uishes the candle and tiptoes off. What
happens subsequently is, mercifully,
undisclosed; whatever it may be, one is
glad it was never brought to D. H.
Lawrence’s attention. A marriage cap-
able of surviving Dr. Alpert’s ministra-
tions would surely need to be strong
indeed.
With LSD thus capable of providing
the two main ingredients of happy 20th-
century living—instant ecstasy and in-
stant sex —is it any wonder that en-
lightened voices like Dr. Leary’s and
Dr. Alpert’s should be raised in praise
of the psychedelic chemical? A great
drug for the Great Society! To the
other capsulated amenities which in-
duce sleep, tranquillity, sterility, etc.,
this, perhaps the greatest of them all,
may be added—promoter of sublime
visions, restorer of lost appetites:
“Hey! Did you hear? There’s a new
shipment of Einstein AA in the village!”
“I’m giving my wife some Elizabeth
Taylor acid for Christmas. Smuggled
in from Mexico. We can all afford to
learn new methods, right?”
“I know it’s against the law, but
Willy is five years old and can’t work
quantum theory equations. So, in des-
pair, I’ve connected with some Max
Platick RNA.”
Besides being an important means
of underpinning the pursuit of happiness
incumbent on all forward-looking citi-
zens, potentially at any rate LSD is
very big business indeed. A whole new
industry can grow up, as extensive as


tobacco or pornography, with cannabis
plantations, sales promotion, advertis-
ing on a huge scale, lobbyists, and other
intimations of grandeur, to the sub-
sequent enhancement of the Gross
National Product. One imagines the
Baudelaire brand, recommended in a
full-color spread in the New Yorker
as fostering the sultriest, most colorful,
most adult dreams Or the Coleridge,
guaranteed to take you straight to
Xanadu, and indispensable for major-
L in Creative Writing. Or the Hash-
ish, with its hint of harems and oriental
orgies—but, on consideration, this name
will not do; there are too many who
have seen and remember the human
debris left by Hashish addiction in
Middle-Eastern countries, where no
facilities exist for sweeping such broken
pieces into psychiatric wards or just
out of the window.
The American students in ever in-
creasing numbers are clamoring for
LSD, and there are said to be some four

Defence in the Universities
Confidential Information
By T. B. MILLAR
THE recent establishment of a
Strategic and Defence Studies
Centre at the Australian National
University raises two questions: is such
an activity legitimately within the func-
tions of a university? and, if it is, why
has it not been done in Australia long
ago?
Australian universities have tended to
be inherently conservative—even more
conservative, in many cases and until
very recently, than the British institu-
tions whose pattern they adopted. The
study of international relations in Aus-
tralia, for example, is comparatively
new, and even now is considered an
exotic plant which should be put into
the hands of only the more advanced
undergraduates. International econ-
omics, trade, or law are respectable
disciplines as are internal politics and
the science or arts thereof, and the
historical study of the international
politics of past generations. But how
the international society works politi-
cally today, current relations between
States, and the conference diplomacy
which takes up so much of the time of
foreign offices these are often con-
sidered rather beyond the pale, and
the writing thereon a form of that very
unacademic and disreputable process,
journalism.
Elsewhere the resistance to the study
of current international problems has
been broken down long ago. There has
been a chair in International Relations
at London for thirty years and more,
and various other British universities
now have one. In the United States
there must be dozens of schools of in-
ternational affairs at universities and
colleges. There is no doubt that there
is a real problem of determining the
reliability of contemporary information,
but of course this is also a problem if
one is dealing with current economic
problems, or with the political events
of a hundred or a thousand years
ago. In fact, in many cases one can
get far more and far better information
about contemporary situations than
about historical ones,
What you cannot often get are the
official documents, and what you can
never get is information about how the
situation is going to work out over the
next ten or fifty years. These are not
reasons for avoiding the study of con-
temporary events. They are reasons for
turning on the source material for con-
temporary events the same critical eye
that one turns on historical events,
In considering problems of defence
or strategy there is a greater depriva-
tion of official information than in
other fields, but nowhere near so much
greater than is usually believed. While
the extent varies according to the sub-
ject, academics in the United States
studying defence problems have told
me that usually about 90 percent of
relevant information is publicly avail-
able. In some cases (e.g. performance
of new weapon systems) the other ten
percent may be vital. In most situations
90 percent of the facts can give a very
adequate basis for analysis. The new
Centre at Canberra has no intention
°f seeking access to classified docu-
ments; if it did it would (very prop-
erly) be refused.
In the United States, academics are
frequently given access to confidential
material by one means or another,
Some are taken (at various levels) into
the public service for a period; some
are employed in institutions working
under government contract and are
given access on a “need to know” basis.
Some act as consultants to the State
Department or the Department of De-
fence. This access does mean that they
will frequently become aware of non-
public factors which may affect their
conclusions, and they have the problem
of how to use such factors in their pub-
lic writings. Yet they cannot assume
that confidential information is neces-
sarily accurate. Confidential informa-
tion is another source perhaps
helpful, perhaps restricting on which
the sceptical eye must also be turned.
At present in Australia there are far
too few academics writing on defence
and foreign policy for very much in
the way of interchange of personnel or
cross-fertilisation of ideas to occur, but
the time must come—if the public ser-
vice, whose regulations are more flexible
than present practice would suggest,
can be induced to agree—when this in-
terchange and cross-fertilisation, under
proper safeguards, will be considered
normal.
If the history of ideas and practices
in the field of defence and strategy is
considered a respectable matter for
study and it usually is the exam-
ination of those matters in a contem-
porary setting must also be reasonable
and will become respectable. Universi-
ties are designed to encourage the
proper disciplined study of the great
economic, social, and scientific prob-
lems of our day. The problems of
security, in almost all the ramifications
of that word, are no less relevant. Some
defence studies have already been done
in Australia among others by Dr.
Bernard Schaffer and Miss Margaret
Lettice at Brisbane, by Dr. Don Ken-
nedy at Melbourne, and by Mr. Arthur
Burns (who established a Defence
Studies Project three years ago) and
myself at ANU. At the University of
Sydney, Dr. Peter King conducts a
fourth year and graduate course on
Military Politics. And during the past
ten or fifteen years a good deal has
been written by other scholars and by
one or two ex-officials on strategic
aspects of Australian foreign policy.
In the United States, Britain, France,
and elsewhere, there are now a score
or more of institutions within,
attached to, or separate from universi-
ties engaged on the study of defence
and strategic problems.
The new Centre at ANU, currently
very small indeed, hopes to supplement
these activities, to co-ordinate existing
projects within the University and to
stimulate new ones; to promote group
projects and conferences, and to publish
the fruits of these labors where relevant
and desirable. It will have no “line,”
and take no responsibility for the views
of the various participants. It will offer
facilities to a wide range of opinions.
It will seek to be judged only by the
academic quality of its output, by the
original contributions it makes to
knowledge, and by the services it
renders to the community.


ONE MORE
WEEK
Paint-In
ONE OF THE MORE depressing
things about life in a booming city is
the whitewashed hoardings with sten-
cilled notices, “Post no Bills,” vthich go
up around every building site. They give
notice in many cases that another plea-
sant building is being pulled down and
something rather unpleasant is going up.
Developers even employ little men to
scrape off the entertainment posters
which inevitably appear on the hoarding
and which, to us, seem an indication
that there is still some life in the city.
Then they do another job of white-
washing and stencilling “Post No Bills.”
When the job is finished the hoarding
is taken away, disclosing a building, in
most cases less well designed and attrac-
tive than the posters which offend the
developers so much.
Recently, however, in Sydney a
women's fashion shop put pretty wall-
paper on its hoarding during reconstruc-
tion. Now bigger things are planned.
Stocks and Holdings are having an art
contest to decorate the hoarding around
its 44-storey block of home units in
Castlereagh Street.
It is not entirely an original idea. A
“paint-in,” as it became inevitably
called, was staged with great success
in Vancouver last summer and there
have been one or two elsewhere. The
Stocks and Holdings people at first
thought of it as a spontaneous, on-site,
affair, but the matter has already got
far more complicated than that.
It is now to be a $lOOO art contest
with a free flight to Montreal for Expo
’67 for the winner. The theme is to be
Man and His World. ’ There are no
restrictions on entry. Artists will be
supplied with hardboard in set sizes
to work on but will supply their own
paints. Space in the basement of a city
arcade has been set aside and entrants
must work here. They are not allowed to
bring completed work from their
studios.
These conditions were worked out
after problems, such as traffic, both road
and footpath, at a busy intersection, and
the existence of strict and corfiplicated
regulations on hoardings, became
clearer. However, Stocks and Holdings
still hope to retain some spontaneity by
making one section of the contest for
on-site painters.
Problems still unsolved are how long
the paintings, chosen by the three judges
for hanging, will remain unspoilt by
either rain or vandals.
Although the first ceremonial pouring
of concrete by the Lord Mayor, Alder-
man Armstrong, takes place this week,
Stocks and Holdings say they have
already sold two-thirds of the units in
the building. Many of the buyers are
believed to be straight-out investors,
some of whom think they will be able
to sell at a profit as soon as the build-
ing is finished. There are people who
live in outlying suburbs who can afford
a city pied-a-terre. Others are wealthy
country people in case you thought
that at the end of the drought there
were none of those left.
Hunt the Shopper
EVEN AS Lend Lease was rolling out
the red carpet last week for the N.S.W.
Governor’s wife, Lady Cutler, to open
Bankstown Square, the company’s
latest, $l7 million shopping centre in
the western suburbs of Sydney, astute
shoppers at Hornsby could pick up at
a local disposals store, for less than $lO,
fine-quality fashion goods, the melan-
choly relics of Lend Lease’s last major
shopping project, La Salle building in
King Street.
La Salle, which opened only in April,
1964, has now closed down about half
its shopping floors. The other half are
being let as offices. The chic boutiques
which are now grouped on the lower
floors can huddle together for warmth
against the chill winds of what Lend
Lease calls “uneconomic trading.”
When Lend Lease opened La Salle
it said that its research officers had
found that they had noted the drift of
shopping to the suburbs and to new-
shopping centres. They had decided on
a major project in the city to halt the
drift. When Bankstown was planned
the busy Lend Lease resdarchers were
at it again. They investigated the
spending and shopping habits of Banks-
town and found that there was a leak-
age of spending money from Bankstown
to other areas, including the city.
It is pretty clear that women are
spending money somewhere. If only
the Lend Lease research people could
find out just where. Our research sug-
gests that the most likely place is the
disposals store at Hornsby.
Play Money
AT THE MOMENT it might seem
that any writer who vaguely suggested
he was about to write a play would
be handed a fistful of money to help
him along. The Sydney Old Tote’s
Jane Street theatre begins its $12,500
season of Australian plays on October
1. One of the season's playwrights,
Thomas Keneally, received $1000, by
courtesy of the N.S.W0 Government, to
write his. Another novelist, Randolph
Stow, has been given $1000 from the
same source to write a play. The Mary
Gilmore $500 award this year will be
for a one-hour television play.
The Elizabethan earlier this year
announced that it had received $6000
from six private firms to commission
Australian plays, but seems reluctant to
say who has been asked to write them.
It went as far as to say four had been
commissioned, but is taking some time
about divulging any more information.
Thomas Keneally, who has published
two novels, was at work on a third
when the Old Tote approached him.
He admits he would not then have
described himself as a regular theatre-
goer, but went off to see Robin
Lovejoy’s production of “Tiny Alice”
at the Old Tote, then went home and
got to work.
His play, “O’Halloran’s Little
Boat,” is an episode from, or a rework-
ing of, his third novel. He wrote the
first act in five days and on this basis
the play was accepted. He has now
more or less got two for the price of
one, taking material from the novel
for the play and vice versa, and has
finished both. The novel will probably
be called “Enemy World.”
The novel was originally intended to
be set in the colony in Governor King s
day and to centre on Irish migrants.
Now Keneally has made it a fictional
penal colony, but the Irish remain.
A central theme is the dilemma of a
young couple who feel they cannot
in conscience marry because there is
no Catholic priest to perform the cere-
mony, and the devious ways in which
other people exploit their agony.

Dear Mother,
Your last letter, which I received yesterday, seemed particularly unreasonable.
How you can question my abilities merely because I am still without a job
after four weeks on the sun-kissed soil of Australia is beyond me. Chances are
that had I remained in the Old Dart I would even now be queuing for the
meagre benefits that the nation can afford. This, I must add, is no fault of
Mr. Wilson’s (God bless the sturdy little Tyke), for he is, surely, but a victim
of circumstances and a thousand years of Tory rule. I thought your grudging
admiration for “the way he conned the Woggies” was small, tribute to his
diplomacy, however two-faced he be.
But, enough of matters temporal. Matters spiritual have come to a head here.
The Australian clergy, in their infinite wisdom, have re-written the Lord’s
Prayer. Controversy rages. One faction says “Our Father, which art in Heaven,”
another says, “Our Father, who is in Heaven,” and there is even a group of
progressives whose paternoster starts, “Dear Sir, Name Hallowed. Address
Heaven. Re arrival of your Kingdom, etc.” This is viewed as a little way
out, but a possible way to drag the Church of England Yeah! Yeah! Yeah-ing
into the trendy ’sixties.
This could be the solution to my joblessness designing mini-cassocks and
PVC mitres for Hip Australian Bishops. I’m not quite sure, but what with one
thing and another, God seems pretty strangely represented.
Yours ever,
Trevor.
Mo/or Changes at Bennelong Pt.
WHILE the Sydney daily news-
papers continue to express an
obsessive interest in the in-
creased number of lavatories to be pro-
vided, there are, in fact, some major
changes of real importance being made
to the design for the Sydney Opera
House.
When Peter Hall, who has taken over
the design role following Utzon’s de-
parture, returned last week from his
three-month study trip, he indicated
the lines along which his panel was
working —and they are lines that should
remove many of the problems which
have been facing the ABC.
There was a real threat that unless
the Opera House would meet the ABC’s
significant list of requirements (and
when Utzon left it appeared to be fall-
ing far short of them on eight main
points) the Opera House would lose
its major potential tenant the Syd-
ney Symphony Orchestra.
One of these was acoustic. While
overseas, Peter Hall had “very exten-
sive and useful meetings with the acous-
ticians” in which the ABC’s require-
ments on reverberation time for good
concert-hall sound (a very different
proposition to the time wanted in an
opera hall) were kept “well in mind.”
It seems likely that the results of these
discussions will be something much
closer to the ABC’s requirements than
the halfway house between the two
ideals which had been proposed earlier
and which suited neither concerts nor
opera.
The new scheme will mean that some
kind of movable board arrangement will
have to be provided when the hall is
to be used for opera to alter the rever-
beration time appropriately.
But the main ABC objection to the
Opera House arrangements as they
appeared to stand when Utzon left was
the question of seating; unless the ABC
could fit 2800 people into the hall in
comfort it felt unwilling to move its
concert venue from the Town Hall,
which can accommodate 2400 and
which requires the orchestra to play
each concert five times to reach all its
audience. The ABC wants to cut down
the number of its repeats.
Peter Hall confirmed overseas that,
in line with the estimates he had made
from the drawings, the acoustic consul-
tants also understood the Utzon seating
arrangements had been for only 2550
people in continental narrow seating
2ft. 7in. apart in front of the stage, or
about 2000 in normal seating.
The ABC now appears hopeful that
Peter Hall’s overseas experience has
brought real hope of getting 2800 people
into the hall for concerts in comfortable
seats 3ft. or so apart, largely as a
result of reverting to Utzon’s original
idea of seating a large number of the
audience on the stage, which would be
lowered to floor level. This would push
the orchestra farther back and would
present a problem with the proscenium
arch.
But it seems possible that something
could be done to raise it and provide
sounding boards that removed any
acoustic or visual suggestion that the
orchestra was “playing in the next
room.” There does seem a chance that
seats may extend a bit farther back
than originally hoped, so that possibly
the idea of balconies, which Utzon had
added to his original idea of an amphi-
theatre, could be done away with.
All these ideas represent a return to
Utzon’s earlier thoughts. The only
major changes at present are the
decision to drop Utzon’s ideas for ply-
wood as a structural member in the
huge glass walls at the ends of the
shells and to use painted steel mullions
instead.
And, of course, the Government is
continuing with its fixation about ten-
dering for everything; Stage I of the
project should have cured them of that.
This is a job where it has been patently
shown to be better to negotiate a price
and get a good job done by a company
that understands the problems than to
call for competitive tenders. But that
is the way Governments work.


You can look at the
new Sebel/Hille* chair from any angle
and still ask:
how can it be so good
and cost so little?
Because it's moulded from a completely
new material—high-flexing-strength
polypropylene. A specially tooled
production line also minimises costs.
So the new Sebel/Hille chair can be sold
in quantities for as little as $B.OO
(£4.0.0) each. Three seat colours —
bone, charcoal, tangerine. Widely used
overseas, the Sebel/H ille has a big
future in Australia for schools,

expensive stacking chairs are required.

The More Abundant Life
Keeping up With Barry Jones
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
BARRY JONES was not always top
of his class at school—“I was
not so good at Maths”—but the
foundations of a world-famous quiz
career were already being laid: as a
small boy he used to trot around pull-
ing a little red cart containing copies
of Pears’ and Cassells’ encyclopedias.
„ , , , ,
Encyclopedias provided a store of
know'edge which he still raids in
Pnk-a-Box ; m those early days, a ong
with the Bible, Van Loons Lives,
aw 't '"‘d emy Kingsley, ey
supphed the basic date data for he
more lofty purpose of a history o the
world. He wrote it when he was 12.
An early paragraph of this epic be-
gins with the sentence “In the latter
part of the Stone Age man grew a little
softer,” and is early evidence of a
deep stratum in the character of Barry
Jones; one which would surprise those
who know him only as the compen-
dium of useful and useless information
brashly offered to Bob Dyer on tele-
vision: he is, in fact, an impulsively
religious man and, in matiy ways, a
puritan.
Not that his TV image is at all
inaccurate as far as it goes. Jones is
brash, unaffectedly self-confident, and
almost grossly extroverted. He knows
his own powers and is pleased that he
has them: “My recall,” he says, “is
freakish but strictly contextual. I re-
member things in proportion to the
e xtent I am interested in them. My
memory is certainly not photographic.”
Talking with Jones last week, I asked
him if he had met any contestant with
greater powers of recall during his
reign as Australian quiz champion,
“Yes, I think Frank Partridge, VC,
probably had greater powers of re-
/ P re tty sure that my ability
to recall what I know quickly was not
as d as his „
j5 id B know more; then? « Per .
j n man y fields, but not necessarily
j n topics. I think Frank lacked
flexibility slightly, which was probably
a resul / of t s he [ ack of a formall ex .
, ensive education _ some of my best
opponents have not read a good book
j n y earS) y OU know. Frank was best at
straight questions. On these his recall
was incredible, but he was not so good
a t interpreting the question and work-
ing out the answer by elimination. He
was tops at the one-clue type question,
whereas I think my memory is more
functional; I can work to the prob-
able answer by a process of deduction
sometimes, even though a certain—say
Chinese—event is not particularly
familiar to me, I can guess that it
could only have occurred in the time of
the Manchu Dynasty for reasons other
than those contained in the question.”
The voice, as he tells you this, is
loud, often very loud: I have never
heard him talk softly. In the street, in
the lift, in cafes, at home, he talks at
much the same volume and rate loud
and fast. He talks about teaching, poli-
tics, music, religion, only if necessary
the quiz show, and reminds one of the
querulous remark of Queen Victoria
about her Prime Minister: “Mr. Glad-
stone always converses with me as if he
were addressing a public meeting.”
In his early days on “Pick-A-Box” it
seemed that these qualities of brash
extroversion and abundant confidence
in his powers of memory, combined
with a passion for accuracy about both
question and answer, perplexed his quiz-
master. As Jones said in 1963: “I don't
think he cared much for me in those
first shows. Bob used to run “Pick-A-
Box” strictly for laughs, with a very
rapid turnover of contestants. The ques-
tions were not very exacting and the
answers often imprecise ... I showed
an early tendency to argue about lack
of precision in the questions. For ex-
ample, he asked the name of the battle
fought ‘on the Plains of Abraham in
1739.’ I corrected him at once, pointing
out the Batde of Quebec (it could
hardly have been anything else) had
occurred in 1759, during the Seven
Years’ War. Before long he overcame
his feeling that I was trying to score
off him, realising that my supplemen-
tary answers were not assumed for show-
business purposes.”
As Jones adds, “I really did, and do,
talk like that.” And he does. Jones
behaves off camera much the same as-
he does on camera. In the early days
of the quiz his manner startled some
and irritated others Australians by
and large prefer their champions to be
self-deprecating about their gifts and
it appeared that many watched the
show hoping that Bob Dyer’s “smart-
Alec” would be humbled, preferably by
an encyclopaedic wharfie or manual
laborer. The fan mail contained much
abuse as well as the usual admiration.
“Why don’t you get off the show and
give someone else a go, you money-
hungry walrus-faced skite . . .” begins a
typical anti-fan letter. But the fans have
softened with time as they have learnt
that what they see is no pose, but rather
the guileless good humor of an ebulli-
ent and intelligent man. The abusive
letters are now rare.
B Y now he has carried off loot to the
nominal value of about $54,000,
but, as he explains, the real value of his
quiz earnings is much less. Included
in the prize-list is a “super-luxury boat
trip” (only half of it used so far)*
“the biggest caravan in the world,”
nominal value $6OOO but sold for much
less (Graham Kennedy now uses it in
the grounds of Channel 9), and all
kinds" of kitchen electricals (some of
them given away). His biggest earnings
were during the credit squeeze and
for most of the “boxes” won he realised
less than half their retail price.
When Jones collects his cash prizes
there is an invisible third hand always
grasping for its share: it belongs to the
Taxation Commissioner. In the early,
big money days (he made $lO,OOO in
his first year) winnings were tax-free,
but when taxation was imposed it was
made restrospective and Jones is still

George Proud,
second-generation
head of Prouds,
talks about
Switzerland’s
finest watch.
“There is indeed a watch with a starting price of $425. Its
name is Patek Philippe. It has been the traditional choice of
monarchs and heads of state since 1839. It still is.
“And as you’d expect, it is also the precision leader among
Swiss watches. Eight times during the past ten years, Patek
Philippe took first place in the annual accuracy contest of the
Geneva Observatory.
“We are the only jewellers in Australia to carry this distin-
guished watch. Not only do we regard Patek Philippe as the
finest watch made in Switzerland; we also know that a Patek
Philippe always represents demonstrably fair value.
“I therefore invite you personally to visit a Prouds store in
order to wind a Patek Philippe. (You can actually feel the
difference.)
“Or to compare the movement of a Patek Philippe with that
of a series-produced watch. (You can readily see the difference.)
“Or to let us tell you about the significance of the Geneva
Seal on the movement of a Patek Philippe. (This distinction is
reserved for about one watch in ten tousand.)
“You will then appreciate that, as the owner of a Patek Philippe,
you will have acquired a rare and precious possession which a
grandchild may still be wearing in another day and age.”

Taxation has upset his plans for full-
time academic work. He first applied to
appear on “Pick-A-Box” after the 1958
election, in which he was the unsuc-
cessful ALP candidate for the Federal
seat of Isaacs. The aim was to use the
prodigious memory to pay the cam-
paign debt of $5OO, and also to put
him through the tail end of a law
course and a post-graduate History
course. “The long-range aim was to
make a packet, go back to the Univer-
sity and perhaps make an academic
career.” Taxation has extended the
plan over a much longer range than
was intended: “Though I have been
able to purchase a ‘Gloria Some’
(actually a flat a couple of miles south
of the city), furnish it, and indulge my
inexhaustible desire for more books and
records.”
The appetite for books, records (his
list of favorite composers runs down
from Bach, Mozart, Beethoven, Ravel),
and art prints is enormous. Much more
interesting than Jones the Quiz King
is Jones the cultural consumer. In the
street he is never without a couple of
books and magazines in hand and is
bursting to tell you about the other
books he read yesterday; at home the
record-player rarely stops! He has a
passion for music, discusses it intelli-
gently, and is a systematic attender of
concerts; with his infectious and extra-
ordinary frankness he told me: “I have a
good ear for music, I think.”
Is there anything he is not good at?
“Yes, I have no talent for languages,
and my physical co-ordination is lousy.”
He has always been hopelessly inept
at sports and is certainly awkward. He
always looks as if he is going to knock
something over or break something
valuable, and as a boy must have been
a disappointment to his father, who
was welterweight boxing champion of
the Australian Navy.
His father was a salesman in man-
chester and softgoods after he left the
Navy, and before World War II owned
a small shop. He joined the Air Force
in 1941 and Barry came under the
strong influence of his mother, and,
through her, his grandmother also.
Their influence, and later that of Pro-
fessor Osborne of the Melbourne Uni-
versity Physiology Department, were
most important during his boyhood.
He went to Strathfield College, a
small private school in Caulfield, for
a time: “It was very good for me be-
cause we received a lot of individual
attention”—then to Ripponlea State
school, Caulfield North Central School
(where his wife, Rosemary, whose
powerful influence on him is obvious to
those who knew them both at Mel-
bourne University, now teaches), and
finally to Melbourne High.
Former schoolmates remember him
as a precocious young monster —“He
was always discovering some new and
weird fact, or contradicting the
teachers, or inventing some new gad-
get”—and, like Randolph Churchill,
must have been an embarrassment to
his friends and a gift to his enemies.
He was fascinated by radio and com-
munications, and, under the persuasion
of Shaw and Wells, dreamed of “a
super-duper information unit” which
would be a storehouse of all known
facts and a centre for their dissemina-
tion to the eyes and ears of the whole
world. Thus would the communication
of knowledge banish ignorance, abolish
war, and conquer evil.
Fortunately for the world, the Jones
scheme for redeeming mankind from
its folly faded into history before it
could be perpetrated, and other Jones
inventions were courteously rejected
by the Allied High Command. But
Jones was not dismayed and is still
likely to describe himself as “an in-
ventor during the war.”
In 1950, he entered the university
on a Dafydd Lewis Scholarship which
did not allow him to do Arts, so he
reluctantly settled for Law: “1 wasn’t
allowed to do Arts and I really couldn’t
see myself as a vet. or a commercial
gentleman and so the Law.”
It has been a spectacularly unsuc-
cessful legal career, which may be some
consolation to his many disappointed
quiz challengers. In his own words: “I
failed Law subjects right, left, and
centre.”
He developed what he calls “a pro-
found antipathy to the Law” (now
much softened), but two things struck
him forcibly as a possible legal career
was falling to pieces: “I was annoyed
that property laws were so much more
meticulously worked out than criminal
laws, and I was staggered by the
profound indifference of the legal
profession to the 1951 Victorian hang-
ings.” (These were the last hangings
carried out in Victoria, the victims
being two men and a woman convicted
of murdering an elderly bookmaker in
Fitzroy.)
Jones explains that he worked as a
legal draughtsman in the Crown Law
Department for a time. “But all the
while the false god of politics was
luring me on.” At the University he
had been president of the ALP Club,
and, with Keith Hancock (now Pro-
fessor Hancock, of Flinders University,
South Australia), he had established
the Chifley Memorial Lecture. “The
first one was given by Dr. Evatt,
whom I practically idolised at the time.
In turn he encouraged me to think
of a political career. Looking back, the
signs of personal tragedy were already
there, but, at the time, my admiration
for Dr. Evatt, his abilities, and many
fine qualities made me blind to his
growing instability.
“I stood for the ALP in the 1958
Federal election and Evatt spoke at
our campaign meeting one night. The
same night, at a previous meeting, he
had offered to stand down from the
leadership if it would bring about
Labor unity and reconciliation with
the DLP. The papers were, of course,
full of the story the next day, but at
my meeting Evatt made no public or
private reference to the offer he had
made earlier in the evening. I was
stunned by this and from that time
began to look a bit closer at the Doc’s
political record.”
In recent years his traditional
Methodist Reformist attitudes have
brought him into conflict with the
ideologues and fellow travellers of
the Victorian branch of the ALP. He
was officially confronted by the Execu-
tive a couple of years ago after “Dis-
sent” published an article of his which
explained that there are really two
Labor parties inside the bulging skin
of the ALP, one of Communist sym-
pathies and the other interested in
gaining political power to carry out
a program of social and economic re-
form.
Charges were formally laid against
Jones by a suburban journalist and
five of the State Executive’s fastest guns
went down to Jones’ ALP branch at
Ripponlea to enforce a reprimand.
Especially they objected to a passage
in which Jones declared:
“J FIND little hatred or fear of the
Victorian ALP nowadays it seems
to be a very toothless old tiger but
the Party does excite much good-
humored derision. Many voters feel
sorry for the Party and would like
to see it restored even if only as an
effective opposition, but do not trust
it enough to give it a vote.
“I submit that there are three main
reasons for Labor’s persistent failure:
(a) Lack of public confidence in
evasive or contradictory policies; (b)
A feeling that the party lacks sufficient
competence to govern; (c) The narrow-
ing basis of party support.”
Things have been quieter since the
Executive failed in its mission, but
there can be no real doubt that Jones,
like a number of other prominent ALP
members, including MPs, is strongly
opposed to the attitudes of the Party
in his State. John Somerville Smith
once called him a Communist agent
hi his “Newsletter,” but no charge could
bh more silly. It is quite evident that
Jones has political attitudes which
would lead him to support the Ameri-
can and Australian military presence
in Vietnam, and he despises the ritualis-
tic clap-trap about the so-called
immorality of conscription, although he
is not happy about conscription on
other grounds. He strongly attacks the
present Federal Government for its
neglect of defence for many years and
he hates the ballot method.
Politics, he claims, ate up eight years
of his thinking between 1955 and 1963
and he now wonders whether it was
worth the effort. He is still active in
the ALP, also in the anti-hanging cam-
paign, and the Victorian Secondary
Teachers’ Association, but as his
ebullience mellows and his rather
boyish character hardens, a vocation of
scholarship begins to draw his imagina-
tion.
Jones realises that his previous pas-
sion for politics was to some degree


25 OVERSEAS
AWARDS TO
GRAMP’S
ORLANDO
■WINES-
Twenty-five Orlando Wines entries in
the 1966 International Wine Fair at
Ljubljana, Yugoslavia, have achieved 25
medals 14 gold and 11 silver. We
have listed some of these wines below,
and commend them for special con-
sideration by all wine lovers.
1961 BAROSSA
WHITE BURGUNDY
This wine is produced mainly from the
Trebbiano grape, which Orlando planted
extensively in 1954 after prolonged ex-
periments on a smaller scale. The Treb-
biano grape has a very strong bouquet,
and to achieve a perfect balance it is
blended with the more delicate Madeira
grape during vintage. The 1963 vintage
of this wine achieved a Silver Medal at
Ljubljana. The 1961 vintage which we
now recommend for immediate enjoy-
ment, has also been a prize winner in
Australia. It was matured in 500 gallon
oak casks for 18 months, and then
bottled.
ORLANDO
MIAMBA CLARET
A medium to full Claret with a pleasing
bouquet and fruity palate, balanced with
a soft and appealing Tannin finish.
Miamba Claret, which was awarded a
Gold Medal, is vintaged from Hermitage
and Cabernet Sauvignon grapes grown at
Orlando’s famous Miamba Vineyard in
South Australia’s fertile Lyndoch Valley.
The delightful colour, bouquet and astrin-
gency is obtained by careful control of
the fermentation on the grape skins.
Immediately after fermentation, the wine
is aged in imported French Oak Casks to
develop its finest qualities.
ORLANDO BLUE RIBBON
SPAETLESE RIESLING
In 1956 Orlando became the first Aus-
tralian wine company to produce a true
Spaetlese, or “late picking" Riesling.
This unique white wine from the Barossa
Valley is vintaged only from the last and
ripest Rhine Riesling grapes picked in
any vintage year. Fermentation is cold
and pressure controlled to enable a steady
transformation of the natural grape juice
into a quintessence of Rhine Riesling.
Blue Ribbon Spaetlese Riesling’s superb
fruity freshness makes it the perfect
wine to enjoy with all sweeter foods,
particularly desserts. It has been
awarded a Gold Medal overseas every
year it has been shown, and the 1962
vintage is particularly commended.
1965 ORLANDO
BAROSSA RIESLING
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Riesling produced in
Australia. It achieved a Silver Medal
at Ljubljana this year.
The Rhine Riesling grapes are gathered
earhf to obtain the desirable natural
acidity. The juice, separated im-
mediately after crushing, is then cold
and controlled fermented to ensure cool,
steady fermentation.
The result is a wine with a pronounced,
yet delicate, Riesling grape fragrance
and a clean, crisp acid palate.
Younger vintages of Barossa Riesling are
in green bottles, arid older vintages which
have acquired the special characteristics
of bottle age, are in amber bottles.

motivated by his liking for address-
ing public meetings and moving the
emotions of big crowds. He is a loud,
very fluent, and amusing orator with
an instinct for the emotions of crowds;
and he loves to play on them.
The call of the academies is strong
these days and Jones has begun work-
ing on his Master of Arts thesis on the
Hapsburg monarch, Joseph II; the title
is “Joseph II as Authoritarian Liberal.”
Jones explains that he simply can-
not understand why more work has
not been done on this man. The gestures
spread as he explains with glee that
“Joseph was the daddy of all guilt-
ridden Catholic Liberals. He was a
disciple of Rousseau as well as of Jesus
and believed that he had to force people
to be free.
“Near the end of his life he grew
so liberal that he set up a secret police
to spy on booksellers and others who
would not be liberal enough in their
behaviour or who discriminated, against
liberal literature. He also held a num-
ber of his opponents in prison without
trial because he suspected them of
being ideologically intolerant. But in
some areas he passed so.me fine laws.
He really was a fascinating man.”
The voice is fruity with good humor
as he tells you all this, and his cheeks
are forever bunching in a smile. The
moustache looks slightly out of pl ace
because the eyes are so youthful. He
doesn’t smoke tobacco or drink alcohol
partly because of certain puritan
instincts and partly because he is so-
extroverted he doestn’t need to.
He has a strong and optimistic Chris-
tian faith, he teaches Sunday School
and loves the passage of the New Testa-
ment in which Christ talks of his mission
to bring “more abundant life” to the
world.
At present he divides his working
time between teaching history at Dan-
denong High School, writing his
thesis, and giving innumerable talks on
countless topics to all kinds of people,
The Jones enthusiasm is boundless, the
mental energy teeming, and the talk
endless. James Russell Lowell had a
couplet for this kind of man:
“Here comes Poe, with his raven, like
Barnaby Rudge,
Three-fifths of him genius and two-
fifths sheer fudge.”
Which is much more of genius and
less fudge than most of the rest of us.
may ever boast.
ON THE MARGIN
How Massive is a Media?
MOST of us have a private list of
unfavorite words and phrases.
Mine includes “husky” (meaning
virile, not hoarse), “rangy,” and
“major.” There is probably a personal
basis for the antipathy, as I myself
am not husky, rangy, or major (though
I was once a lieutenant in Army Public
Relations). The proliferation of majors
in recent years has been remarkable.
They have their fingers in everything
from the medical profession, where they
perform major surgery, to lotteries, in
which they win major prizes. A good
many majors could, with advantage,
be put on the retired list.
At the moment, however, I am not
concerned with the husky major ques-
tion. I propose to sound off about “mass
media.” This expression is favored by
highly educated persons who wish to
refer in a disparaging way to news-
papers, radio, and television. Professor
Max Beloff, of Oxford, for example,
lately blamed the mass media for the
establishment of Britain’s comprehen-
sive secondary schools, of which he dis-
approves.
The word “media,” with or without
“mass,” is also used in the advertising
business, where it is sometimes treated
as a singular noun. In a book on ad-
vertising I read: “Choose a media that
provides maximum market penetra-
tion.” But advertising men do not
despise mass media quite the con-
trary and they think of them in
a purely business way, as vehicles for
advertising. They are not the ones who
irritate us toilers in the mass media, or
mass mediocrities as we doubtless could
be called.
What we dislike is partly the patron-
ising tone of the phrase, its suggestion
that everything which reaches a mass
audience is vulgarised and over-
simplified to appeal to the peasantry.
This is not necessarily the case. For
some centuries the chief mass medium
was the Bible, but the sages of those
times did not feel called on to deplore
its misleading influence.
Still more annoying to those who
work in newspapers, television, etc., is
the lofty remoteness of the term “mass
media” from what they do. It sounds
as if they are always thinking: “I must
communicate with the masses,” or
“What will the masses think of this?”
When actually they are only trying to
report a libel case, or interview a
politician, or photograph a football
match.
“Mass media” has the same kind of
distant frigidity as the expression “the
labor force,” by which management
experts like to describe people who work
somewhere. The phrase implies, of
course, that there are other, superior,
media for communicating with the
elite.
It is interesting to speculate on the
mental picture that thinkers like Pro-
fessor Beloff have of the way the media
operate. Something like this, I presume:

lately, Potluck. Your reporting of the
City Council has become too careful
and accurate. The masses don’t like that
sor t of thing. They demand color,
excitement, glamor.”
“I’m sorry, sir, I thought they might
want to know the facts.”
“You’re wrong, Potluck. Several of
the masses have complained to me
about it. They say your analysis of
the garbage scandal was so intelligent
they could not read it.”
“I hope you’ll give me another
chance, sir. I think I could do a massive
feature on the sex life of aldermen.”
“That’s better. And make it bright.
Remember our motto Always the
Happy Medium.”
While at the other end of town, in
the office of the Weekly Minority
Medium, columnist Peregrine Swope is
in another kind of trouble.
The Editor speaks: “I’m sorry to
say, Swope, that an insidiously enter-
taining quality has crept into your
writing. It is having a bad effect on
sales our circulation is rising
steadily.”
“I’ve only been doing my best, sir.”
“Well it’s not good enough. If this
paper becomes much more popular, it
will be nothing better than a mass
medium. We shall lose our elite reader-
ship.”
“It won’t happen again, sir. I’ll put
in more long words and statistics. That
ought to frighten the masses off ... ”
The reality, from my experience, is
different. Writing for a paper with a
large sale is just as exacting as writing
for a paper with a small one. There
are the same two rules: don’t be wrong
and don’t be dull. And, curiously, you
never at any time feel like a member
of the labor force of a mass medium.
You just feel like a person.
ROSS CAMPBELL
WINE OF THE MONTH
The Menzies Claret
“mHE best claret I have been served
in my own country for a long
time.” The speaker is Sir Robert
Menzies, politician extraordinary,
palatician unknown.
However, if you can’t beat them . . .
As my Wine of the Month I select
Sir Robert’s Wine of the Year, Yalumba
Reserve Stock Galway Vintage Claret
1961. Wholesale wine merchants and
agents report that stocks very quickly
sold out after this recent comment,
but there is still some of the wine on
the retail shelves. Only yesterday I
bought a bottle.
The wine is put together at the
Yalumba Cellars by Rudi Kronberger
and his staff from wines made locally
and obtained from McLaren Vale. In
both cases the material is from the
Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz grapes.
The local wine is from the company’s
Angaston vineyards, in which the Caber-
net has been bud grafted on to Grenache
and Mataro stocks to produce a straight
Cabernet result. It’s a wonderful thing
and we must be very grateful for it.
In this way the Cabernet comes into
quicker bearing than from cuttings and
there is no difference in the wines.
There are two of these Reserve
Stock wines that have been on sale
[or sime time—the ’6O and ’6l. The ’6l
is very well balanced, light, and clean,
showing a good combination of Caber-
net and oak flavors with a delightful
soft tannin finish. A wine showing con-
siderable complexity and finesse. The
pak flavors come from initial maturation
m puncheons of Nevers oak, which a
i°t of makers seem to prefer nowadays
to the Limousine oak. The flavors
from the latter sometimes appear to be
a little harder and more pungent.
The ’6O is a bigger wine altogether,
fuller-bodied on the palate and with a
slightly harder finish. Both of these
wines will improve for years, though
the ’6l is better drinking now. I have
already had an argument with one of
the Yalumba wine-making staff about
the ultimate qualities of these two
wines. I maintain that the ’6O will finish
up the better wine in the long run. Now
that he has found such support, I will
have to tread lightly. If you can’t beat
them ... ' v
Yalumba have been famous for years
for their ports and sherries. Samuel
Smith got the establishment going in
1849 by planting vines by moonlight
after working through the day in the
orchard and garden of George Angas.
One hundred and seventeen years of
uninterrupted growth. Yet it was not
until five or six years ago that they
started to produce any quantity of red
table wine at all. Before then they had
mostly purchased their requirements.
They had made a white table wine for
some time which was very popular,
but their total table wine output until
comparatively recently was still only
ten percent of their production. Now
it’s nearly half, and it probably won’t
be long before it’s even more. Their
red wines have been getting better and
better, and in the most recent show in
Melbourne they took three gold medals
in Burgundy classes and a couple of
trophies as well. They also have bin
upon bin of wine in their huge storage
cellars, some bins alone containing over
20,000 bottles. But you still can’t hurry
this business and the next Reserve Stock
issue of this claret line, the ’62 vintage,
won’t be until early next year.
I do recommend this new line as a
most interesting wine to follow and
advise you to snap up what of the ’6O
and ’6l you can find to start from the
beginning. Then as the new vintages
come out you may purchase quantities
and compare them against each other.
This is one of the joys of having a
maturing cellar and, like the Mildara
tasting I described a couple of months
ago, it’s one of the really great pleasures.
Apparently Sir Robert is shortly to
spend three months in America as
Scholar-in-Residence at the University
of Virginia. He is taking a supply of
the ’6l with him to entertain friends
over there and show them just how
good our wines are.


The Riches in the Rag Trade
Putting Melbourne on the World Fashion Map
By APRIL HERSEY
Melbourne, long associated
with fine, if conservative, fashion
in Australia, may follow Rome,
Madrid and Dublin and come, to
be accepted as an off-beat world
fashion centre, particularly if it con-
tinues to inspire the young designers
who are industriously coining new
styles and money in equal measure in
Victoria’s staid capital.
As the time approaches for the 1967
winter collections, shown in late Sep-
tember-October, a sense of urgency
speeds up the action. Simultaneously
two designers doyen of the young,
Norma Tullo and Prue Acton have
had great overseas success. Tullo’s
Tokyo boutique opened in the first
week of September, complete with ner-
vous Japanese models, oak beams, and
geraniums, and was an instant sell-out.
In the same week young Prue Acton
learnt that her small American collec-
tion had been enthusiastically received
in New York. Both designers are sell-
ing their collections to be made under
licence. The Japanese store, the fabu-
lous Isetan, promises Miss Tullo to
follow her designs to the last stitch
and to sell 15,000 garments worth
$700,000 in the first year. Lord and
Taylor, will sell the Acton line through
2500 stores at twice the Australian
price.
Male designers are equally busy. Last
week 32-year-old Kenneth Pirrie
arrived back from a world tour which
was also a sounding trip to find out
which overseas markets are anxious to
handle the Pirrie Look.
JJISING fast (three years) on the
scene is Thomas Wardle, whose sales
tickets feature a naked mod nymphet
saying “I luv Thomas Wardle.” A
little older (mid thirties) than some
of his competitors, Thomas Wardle
spent 13 years in textiles, had a solid
grounding in the rag trade before
hanging out his tag. He feels that
many of the success stories are founded
on cotton-wool and that many so-called
designers couldn’t cut a pattern, but
has respect for Norma Tullo “a great
talent and a fine businesswoman.”
Secure in her five-storey building in
Lonsdale Street, with her wealthy hus-
band as landlord, Miss Tullo presides
over an empire of charming decor, all
trailing ivy, oak beams, geraniums,
black-and-white-check fabrics, and
leatherbound books. Everyone calls her
Norma, but with a most respectful
inflection, for this woman with the
gentle manner and the candid gaze
has been astute enough to establish
herself firmly in the shifting sands of
fashion in just ten years.
A Melbourne girl, she studied design-
ing, but turned sensibly to secretarial
work after graduation, only using her
talent on her own wardrobe. But success
stories are meant to happen. When she
designed a pair of patterned slacks
and had them made up by a French
tailor her friends asked her to copy
them. The demand was so persistent
that she had some made up and showed
them to the buyer at Myers famous
Emporium. He bought, and Norma
Tullo’s success had begun.
Her first room was in Bourke Street,
and it was not until she was well estab-
lished that she moved to Collins Street.
There the Tullo company gradually
filled two floors, spilled out into the
corridors, and perched like pigeons on
the windowsills. To reach her desk
Norma had to climb through a wilder-
ness of fashion impedimenta, and before
they could close the doors at night they
had to empty the corridors of bolts of
fabrics, dresses, and designs.
The move to Lonsdale Street was
made two and a half years ago. Now
elegantly styled from the doormat,
which says simply Tullo, to the top
floor, where its governing director sits
at her massive carved-oak desk with the
fire blazing in the hearth, the building
which seemed so large at first, may
soon be outgrown.
In the midst of this success and
luxury, Norma Tullo, at 31, feels she
is “almost a woman” and looks back
on the challenges faced and mastered
over the years with gratitude. “The
experiences help to make you,” she feels,
but wistfully longs for “more time in
the fast-moving years.” Married to a
successful businessman, Brian King, and
mother of year-old Christopher, whose
arrival was fitted in “between collec-
tions,” she leaves a beautiful new home
to be at her office desk at 8.45 a.m.,
rarely leaves before 5.30 p.m. and often
continues until 8.0 p.m.
“Success is partly intuition,” she said.
“And there can be few mistakes now. I
have 48 people in the office. They all
pass opinions on the designs, and if they
dislike something I adore, I know I
must throw it out. They are my public
opinion.”
Will, she eventually be a millionaire?
“No! It is nowhere near that sort of
success!” Almost a note of panic from
someone who designs 800 garments a
year and has 22 sub-contracting fac-
tories making up more than 2000 gar-
ments a week.
Also destined for a tour of personal
promotion, blue-eyed Prue Acton will
tell America about the Acton line in
large department stores across the
country when she goes there in a few
months’ time. Still young enough to refer
constantly to her mother as she gives
details of her three years in fashion,
Prue Acton is married, will have to
leave her expected baby behind when
she flies to the U.S. to shake the money
tree. She still seems a little numb from
the instant success she has enjoyed since
she offered her first few dresses to a
boutique.
Her first few dresses were bought
immediately. Orders followed. Buyers
searched her out in her little room five
floors up in Flinders Lane. Now she
has an office staff of 20, produces four
collections for Australia, two for New
Zealand, two for England, two for
America, and has just done a knitting
book and a lingerie collection. “What
I like about it is that the dresses New
York is excited about are the ones I
designed for Australia last year,” she
said. “This means we are six months
ahead instead of six months behind.”
JJAVING the right thing on sale in
the right place is the secret of suc-
cess in the fashion business. It doesn’t
happen to everyone. For Kenneth Pirrie
it was a pair of grey flannel slacks which
turned out to be just what the young
crowd wanted when no one else had
marketed them. Now in the usual MIS
atmosphere of the design studios, Pirrie
and his staff produce 500 designs a year
for the popular 15 to 25 age group,
turn out 3500 garments a week. This
spring a range of sleep-wear will bear
the Kenneth Pirrie label.
Labels are read enthusiastically by
the people with money to spend—the
in-group of the day, who apparently
give up wearing clothes after age 25.
Once the shopper reaches the conserva-
tive stage she is relegated to twin-sets
and a string of pearls.
“We can fit up to 71 percent of the
young market,” Thomas Wardle con-
siders. “But even by studying the
statistics of the Australian female figure
one can never make the perfect dress.
The shape of shoulders, the depth and
position of the bust all play a part in
fitting a dress. And, of course, the older
woman finds it hard to wear fashion
today, though there should be some-
thing in Melbourne for her.”
Indeed there should. Considering the
volume of designs (Norma/ Tullo with
800 originals compared with a Parisian
fashion house which might have a few
dozen), there should be enough fashion
for anyone. In fact, to the transient
visitor, Melbourne with its lively hive
of boutiques gives the impression that
of the two million inhabitants, one
million is engaged in selling clothes to
the other million.
Blame it on the cold climate which
keeps designers huddled by the fire,
or attribute it to the fact that so many
textile firms are in Melbourne, but
though some fashion houses such as
Trent and Fontana flourish in Sydney,
Melbourne is on the world map.

AROUND MELBOURNE
A Marvellous Auction Sale
PLEASE don’t make any mistake,
Victorians look with great
kindness upon the Sydney
Opera House. This is proved by the
point that they have contributed so
generously fovvard its construction.
In the past five years or so they
have never ceased to buy large
quantities of Opera House tickets.
If, now, they are beginning to
sound insufferably smug, again,
please understand. It is just the
young sister wanting to express her
different personality.
Here is how the personality has
been differing. The Melbourne Cul-
tural Centre did not have an inter-
national competition for design. Roy
Grounds was chosen from the outset.
The committee recommended in its
original report that the exterior
should not be palatial in a for-
bidding way; it asked for something
dignified, yet unassertive. Already,
our cultural centre is beginning to
look dignified, unassertive, and it
will be partially hidden by trees in
St. Kilda Road.
There have been no strikes, no
controversy, and it is building bang
on schedule. Already it has an
underground car park which will
take 1200 cars, and nobody seems to
have any doubts that the centre
will be open for business in mid-
-1968. The 415 ft. gold-tipped spire
will be finished in 1970.
But Melbourne, particularly, is
asserting its quiet personality
through costs. The original estimate
was $l4 million and so far we have
only been able to kick it up to $lB
million. While many of us have felt
this is bad for international PR,
there is no hope of the final cost
passing $2O million.
You see, Sir Henry Bolte stead-
fastly has refused to finance Mel-
burnian projects through lotteries,
he won’t even run a lottery for an
underground railway. The Cultural
Centre has been financed almost
entirely through Government cash
payments and $2 million is coming
from public subscription of which
$1,300,000 already has been raised.
Therefore we have to go out and
search for money. Quite the most
intriguing system is the auction,
and the first of these was at the
Dorchester on September 20. All
the right people came and paid $8
a ticket for dinner.
The auction was downright
fascinating. Item 31 was a dinner
for six at Parliament House, Can-
berra, with Mr. Arthur Calwell.
This went for $6O. The Press
descended on the table of the lucky
successful bidder, but he would
give no information whatever.
Apparently if you are paying $6O
to have dinner with Arthur Calwell
it’s something you want to keep
pretty dark.
Mr. Ed. Clark, the U.S. Ambas-
sador, came from Canberra and
he donated a two gallon hat which
formerly belonged to LBJ him-
self and inscribed “LBJ Ranch,
Johnson City.” This went for $75.
Patrick White’s “Four Plays,”
presented and autographed by
Patrick White himself, was worth
$lOO, but there was no panic rush
for Dita Cobb’s false eyelashes,
presented by Dita Cobb. These
were worth $B.
Then there was the aerial tour
of Melbourne and environs for two
people offered by Roy Grounds
and Co. Pty. Ltd. This was
popular. It went for $7O.
The best buyer for the evening
was Melbourne’s top patron of the
arts, Aubrev Gibson. He bought an
autographed copy of “The Wit of
Sir Robert Menzies,” donated by Sir
Robert,' for $4O, a room air con-
ditioner worth $390 for $5OO, and
a chair and footstool for $240.
All this raised $4490, but next
Saturday there will be a grand public
auction in the Exhibition Building.
Here some of the items are even
more fascinating. Keen bidding is
expected for item No. 21 “goggles
and snorkel belonging to the Prime
“ What am 1 offered for this
priceless curiosity donated by a
Sydney admirer...
Minister the Rt. Hon. Harold
Holt, MP, and autographed by him.”
And how could anyone resist item
34 “a tankard and bottle of milk
stout from the Rovers’ Return in
Coronation Street, presented by
GTV9.” Of course, it will be inter-
esting to see how bids for the tank-
ard compare with the set of golf
clubs donated by Sir Henry Bolte,
or the five laps around Calder in an
E-type Jaguar with Bob Jane.
If you don’t like being terrified
in a Jag you can be terrified in a
Morris-Cooper with Peter Manton.
Oh, yes, you can bid for Sabrina's
cloak, Jim Gerald’s wig, Bill Lawry’s
cap, a pair of shark jaws from Bob
Dyer, the original dagger used by
Joan Sutherland in “Lucia,” or if
your cultural tastes vary you can
go for an item direct from “Peyton
Place,” or a football autographed by
Ron Barassi. Other items, like trips
by ship and aircraft far afield, are
being sold by written bids and ail
this should raise vast sums of money.
So you see all is going smoothly.
Only one thing about the Opera
House raises the envy of Melburn-
ians. Alas, we have been unable,
satisfactorily, to solve this problem
of a name. The original title was
the National Gallery and Cultural
Centre of Victoria.
For years we hunted for a name.
There were some marvellous sug-
gestions. The Concourse of Culture.
The Dallas Muse. The Haven of
the Arts. Inspiration Centre. The
Triad Art Temple. Anzacult. Ark of
Culture. Queen Elizabeth Hall.
Prince Charles Gallery of Fine Arts.
Harmony Hall. Batman Centre.
Then there was the gentleman who
wrote Eric Westbrook a long, rambl-
ing letter, and he felt that at last he
really discovered the right name. He
wanted to call it “The Artorium.”
Finally, Sir Henry Bolte objected
to the word “cultural” in the title,
which he felt was pompous. So there
was a formal announcement last
month that the title would be
“National Gallery and Art Centre
of Victoria.” There has not been
great enthusiasm for it and some
people like Sir Daryl Lindsay are
still hopeful that it will be abridged
to something simple like “The Vic-
torian Art Gallery.”
The “Herald” art critic, Alan
McCulloch, said: “The name
National Gallery and Art Centre
is shocking ... it revives the paro-
chialism of colonial times, when
interstate jealousies caused the
State Galleries to call themselves
‘National’ Galleries.”
But surely nobody would accuse
us of that.

All airlines have pilots. So why be so proud of ours? Because we know them
right from their very first plane ride. Where other airlines buy pilots,
we train them. From scratch. Even though it takes seven of our 56 plane fleet
to do it. And puts our senior captains into the instructor’s seat.
And keeps our graduate pilots in the co-pilot’s seat. For a year at least.
And logs each of our captains 10,000 hours or more, before they ever see
the flight deck of a DCB. And still they could be 5,000 hours away
from the controls. Of course, they do make the most experienced flight
engineers, navigators and first officers in the business, which is what
we are after. Exactly. But perhaps you think we’re a little extreme.
(Especially if you know how many pilots we lose to other airlines who buy
and don’t train!) But to us it’s worth it. Because it gives us an edge.
A little bit extra to offer all along the line. Even if it's up front,
where, maybe, you’ll never notice,

What does this mean? Simply this. The ability to
provide words and figures. When accounting
machines do this you get descriptive accounting.
And this is something Burroughs Series F account-
ing machines do exceptionally well. They have two
keyboards within a hand-span of each other. A full
numeric keyboard with more than ample capacity
plus an 84 character electric typewriter. And besides
being able to carry out an almost unlimited variety
of numeric and alphanumeric accounting functions,
all Burroughs Series F accounting machines have
optional punched card or paper tape output. This
valuable adjunct provides media for direct input
to a computer for further detailed analysis and/or

ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT
Opera on a Shoestring
By JOHN CARGHER
ARCHITECTURE’S loss could be
music’s gain. I am not speaking
of the Sydney Opera House,
though that building may well play a
large part in the future of a young
Melbourne architect. In less than four
years Leonard Spira has emerged as
a major force in Melbourne music-
making. The fact that he has done so
while doing a full day’s work as an
architect makes this an astonishing
feat.
I first became aware of Spira when
I attended a performance of “The
Merry Wives of Windsor” by the Vic-
torian Opera Company, an amateur
group which split from the Victorian
Light Opera Company in 1962 because
its members grew tired of performing
only Gilbert and Sullivan. The theatre
was Melbourne’s favorite echo chamber,
the Russell Street Theatre, and the
orchestra of 30 or so players was
cramped together under the minute
stage apron. In these daunting cir-
cumstances I heard a performance of
the hackneyed overture which had all
the sparkle and freshness of a Beeeham
Lollipop and almost as much polish.
The orchestral standard during the
opera proper was almost faultless. Later
I was staggered to discover that the
players were a random assembly of
amateurs, semi-professionals and stu-
dents.
Since then Spira has repeated this
apparent miracle again and again,
covering such varied subjects as “Car-
men,” “Seraglio,” “The Gypsy Baron,”
Dvorak’s Requiem and “La Belle
Helene.” I therefore made it my busi-
ness to find out what makes Spira tick.
The facts are as staggering as the
results he produces.
Leonard Spira has no musical quali-
fications for the work he is doing. He
is self-taught to a large degree. His
parents left Poland when he was four,
just before the German invasion. They
fled to Lithuania, Russia, then Japan,
hoping to reach Canada. When that
country did not want them, their eyes
turned to Australia.
Although Leonard Spira’s father had
been a professional violinist in Poland,
had even conducted his own orchestra,
he was determined that his son should
have the benefit of a “safe” profession
and, under protest, young Leonard went
through Melbourne University to at-
tain his degree in architecture. But
blood is thicker than mortar and the
father could not, and did not, repress
the son’s musical talents. He learned the
piano, with little success, and switched
to the horn. This proved a splendid
choice and within a short time the full-
time architect also became the part-
time deputy horn player in everything
from the then Victorian Symphony
Orchestra to the pit of “My Fair Lady.”
The Spira family moved in musical
circles. Father became Victorian secre-
tary for Musica Viva. Leonard fell in
love with a young clarinettist who, for
his sake, went through university to
obtain her own degree in architecture,
much as she hated it. In due course
both began to devote more and more
time to amateur music-making, until
fate brought Leonard Spira into the
Victorian Light Opera Company. The
musical titbits he had picked up in the
course of his performing activities now
began to combine with the methodical
mind of the architect. Spira applied
system and method to obtaining maxi-
mum results from minimum rehearsals
and, amazingly, it worked.
Last year the Victorian Opera Com-
pany appointed Spira its sole musical
director and this year he further diver-
sified by putting on performances by his
own Leonard Spira Opera Company
which, while tackling smaller works,
produced an even higher standard.
Spira’s “Seraglio” will be talked about
in musical circles in future years as the
turning point, for this was professional
opera limited by one thing only: money.
Produced without backing of any kind,
it played to capacity houses. The cos-
tumes and scenery were made by Spira
and his family from designs by Pamela
ISpira; a dress-manufacturer now, she
still plays clarinet in her husband’s
operas but only rarely looks at her
architecture degree. The second solo
Spira production was “Fidelio,” another
success. Next year he is planning
Monteverdi’s “Poppaea,” plus “Elisir
d’Amore” with possibly “The Flying
Dutchman” for the Victorian Opera
Company.
Clearly Spira is succeeding in what
the National Theatre has failed to
achieve with all its backing. (Limited
though this be, it must seem like riches
to a man like Spira.) Local musical
pundits are predicting the spontaneous
creation of a Melbourne Opera Com-
pany and, with the new National Cul-
tural Centre trying to beat Sydney’s
opera house, the dream may come true.
But I believe that opera must be
based on audiences, not subsidies, even
though the former may depend on the
latter. The possibility that two pro-
fessional opera companies can justify
their existence in terms of audience
attendances is small. For the sake of
opera, for the sake of audiences, for
the sake of Australia we must use all
the talents this country can produce to
achieve initially one organisation which
will be successful enough to build the
audiences which may one day justify
the creation of a second opera com-
pany. By force of circumstances Vic-
toria must accept that the Elizabethan
Trust Opera is now also the N.S.W.
Opera Company and that as a base the
Sydney Opera House must be better
Actor Peter O’Shaughnessy as the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas in Sidney Michael's
play “Dylan,” opening at the Independent Theatre, Sydney, on September 29.
A friend of Dylan Thomas, who saw a rehearsal, on first seeing O’Shaughnessy
come on stage, exclaimed, “God, it’s Brendan Behan!” but seeing O’Shaughnessy
in performance decided he looked “incredibly” like the poet.

The Trust-Sydney Opera Company
will come into permanent being at the
conclusion of the present season. Plans
which I have seen promise the best
box office season yet for next year.
Before then a musical director will have
to be appointed. Were we in a posi-
tion to obtain a major name in interna-
tional musical circles and were such a
name prepared to come to Australia
full-time at a salary we can afford, no
further word would come from me. But
no man of standing apparently wants
to manage the opera house itself, so
what chance is there of any but a
second-rater applying for the musical
directorship?
Leonard Spira may still be inexperi-
enced, but he has shown that he has
the ability to create a positive artistic
whole on little more than a shoestring.
This very fact qualifies him for the
position; no overseas import would work'
efficiently in the financial insecurity
which is bound to haunt this company
for some years yet. By the time the
final, established “Opera Company of
Australia” opens the new Sydney Opera
House Leonard Spira will be an experi-
enced musical director superior to any
we could then import and, for once, a
leading Australian artistic organisation
would be led by an Australian! Or is
the thought too revolutionary?
LETTER FROM EDINBURGH
Everything Except Good Films
Edinburgh is one of the most
beautiful cities in the world, and
one of the wettest. It was raining
when I was here five years ago and it
is raining still. However, since David
Bruce, the director of the city’s Film
Festival, took over the job three years
ago Edinburgh has been regaining its
position as an important film festival
city.
Bruce recalled the time when Vittorio
de Sica came for a retrospective showing
of his films. He was whisked directly
from the airport to the theatre to find
someone had forgotten to remove the
Russian flag from the previous screen-
ing. On his return to his hotel he found
it was too late to get any food at all.
He returned to Italy the next day and
since then the Italians have boycotted
the Edinburgh Film Festival.
However, things are on the up-swing.
Delegates are very well looked after,
and everything runs smartly to schedule.
The snag remains that the films are
not very good.
The Festival opened with the Scottish
premiere of “Doctor Zhivago,” held in
one of Edinburgh’s largest cinemas
before a packed audience. Flora Rob-
son was guest-of-honor, and a reception
given by the Lord Provost followed
the screening. I had seen Lean’s film
in Sydney and found a second viewing
rather trying. Many of the films that
followed it for the next two weeks were
equally trying.
Edinburgh is not run on a subscrip-
tion basis as are the Sydney and Mel-
bourne Film Festivals, but is on the basis
of individual admissions. Thus a film
which does not sound promising on
paper can receive a very poor attend-
ance. Such was the case of the East
German entry, “Journey Into Happi-
ness,” a musical about a very amorous
boatswain aboard a merchant ship who
continually gives his captain problems
with love-sick maidens stowing away to
be near him. It is a -teenage film, not
to be compared with British films like
“Help!” or “Catch Us If You Can,” but
far closer to the American bikini-beach
movies. The director, Joachim Hasler,
was present at the screening, but re-
ceived a rather lukewarm reception.
A rather better musical, “Janos
Hary,” was the Hungarian entry.
Adapted from a Zoltan Kodaly opera, it
tells of a brave Hungarian soldier and
his exploits in the service of the Austrian
Emperor, culminating in an encounter
with Napoleon. The artificial settings
provide a few amusing moments (the
frontier-post with snow on the Prussian
side and spring in full bloom on the
Hungarian side; the court of the Aus-
trian Emperor, where even the dogs
and cats wear little golden crowns)
but the dubbed singing voices given the
actors seldom match and it goes on
much too long.
T wo films dealt with the difficulty of
communication. This, of course, is
a subject Antonioni has made his own,
but the Dutch film “A Morning of Six
Weeks,” made by Nikolai van der
Heyde, was filmed very much in the
style of Jean-Luc Godard with hand-
held camerwork, jump-cuts, and a
couple of nude love scenes. It concerns
a Dutch’ racing driver and a French
model whose love affair degenerates
into a series of squabbles and irrita-
tions. The director is full of sympathy
for his characters but not for his audi-
ence. The film is about 20 minutes too
long. Rather more successful and last-
ing only eight minutes, is the American
short “I’ve Got This Problem.” In this
case, when boy meets girl they cut out
the talk about the weather and get
right down to communication proper
—but neither really listens to what the
other is saying. This is a very funny
little film.
Another couple with a problem were
in the West German film “It.” Manfred
and Hilke are a young unmarried
couple living together cheerfully and
comfortably. He is an estate agent, she
a technical designer. Hilke finds that she
is pregnant. She knows Manfred does
not want marriage, and she is deter-
mined to find a way out of her dif-
ficulty without telling him. And so “it”


___the unborn child —comes between the
lovers. The young director, Ulrich
Schamoni, presents the case for and
against abortion, and leaves it to the
audience to decide where Manfred and
Hilke go from here. It is one of an
exciting number of new films from the
formerly moribund West German film
industry.
“Storm Signal” is a 50-minute
American film made by James Lips-
comb in the cinema-verite style which
studies drug addiction. Lipscomb,
with hand-held camera and portable
sound-recording equipment, lived for
four months with a young couple
addicted to heroin. During this period,
the husband was arrested for robbery
and the wife, only 21 years old, was left
to look after their small son and also
find drugs for herself. She decides to
try to “kick” the habit and enters hos-
pital for an agonising period of with-
drawal. The camera follows relentlessly,
bringing the viewer into her wretched
world.
For light relief we were able to turn
to the Russian entry, “Watch Your
Car!” a very funny comedy starring
Innokenty Smoktunovsky (who was the
Russian Hamlet) as a compulsive car
thief who, however, only steals from
those who he considers have purchased
their cars with ill-gotten money. The
situation is made more ridiculous in
that the hero is appearing in an
amateur production of “Hamlet” in the
title role, and the detective in charge
of the investigations into the series of
robberies is playing Laertes. The dir-
ector, Eldar Riazanov, seizes the obvious
opportunities provided by this situation
and there are several amusing references
to Smoktunovsky’s role in the Shake-
speare film.
EXPATRIATE Pole director Roman
Polanski (who made “Knife In The
Water,” in Poland, and then the chilly
“Repulsion,” in Britain) was respon-
sible for the Festival’s best film, “Cul-
De-Sac.” The lives of an oddly assorted
couple (Donald Pleasance and Francoise
Dorleac) are interrupted by the arrival
at their remote island home of a pair
of runaway gangsters (Lionel Stander
and Jack MacGowran). But this is no
thriller. Polanski explores the camerad-
erie that quickly grows between the
bald, middle-aged, slightly prissy hus-
band and the rough Bowery gangster.
The short films at Edinburgh were
mostly disappointing, except for an
excellent program presented personally
by Derek Hill, whose Short Film Ser-
vice has done so much good work in
Britain.
Probably the short (?) film which
received the most hostile reception was
from Australia admittedly too long
at 51 minutes, “The Broken Hill” prob-
ably deserved a slightly better fate.
It’s very well photographed and edited,
but the Edinburgh audience probably
objected to the excessive use of “Waltz-
ing Matilda” on the soundtrack and the
implication that lead and zinc from
Broken Hill rebuilt West Germany.

Beholder’s Eye
Stan Ostoja-Kotowski. Gallery A, Syd-
ney.
John Coburn. Hungry Horse, Sydney.
Jan Senbergs. Rudy Komon, Sydney.
AT the Museum of Modern Art in
New York there is, in a darkened
room, like an oblatory temple,
a whole wall on which incandescent,
unpredictable mists swirl, fade, build
to cumulus climaxes and drift into
sunshot showers; it’s a modern sub-
stitute for the fireplace flames of our
childhood, an up - to - date reverie
stimulator.
Stan Ostoja-Kotkowski, of Adelaide,
is too much the formal, geometric
manipulator to provide opportunities
for daydreams; to taped electronic
music, fixed circles in boxes change
their hues as concealed lights glow
through polarised filters, but one feels
(if feeling comes into it) only retinally,
not emotionally, involved. In most of
his “static” optical paintings the effect
is the same; circles, discs, and spirals
suspend the emotions as though you
were looking down the bore of a
revolver.
Ostoja’s is a curious aim; he wants
the surface to twitch, shiver, pulsate,
and make the retina tingle, but he’s
also a devotee of the solid symmetrical
form. However much he invades his
basic shapes with sharp lines and tapes
of brilliant hues, they remain hypnotic,
focal points. He seems to want to be
master not only of every facet of his
work but of our every response.
It might seem whimsical that he
provided red-green glasses once used
for looking at three-dimensional films,
but even with these the results were
soon scientifically predictable: a crisp,
lively optical work of radiating blues
and greens on sharp red went glowing
grey and then turned a golden pink and
black again.
His works, usually made of thin
strips of vibrant color glued to glow-
ing crimson on metallic paper in
golden lemon, have curious affinities
with the overall flicker of impression-
ism, for, unlike many overseas optical
painters, he doesn’t try to induce an
emphatic vertigo or try to capture us
with one great visual gesture. In fact,
he’s a shade too scientific; he retains
some of the static (despite his devices
to the contrary) features of relational
abstraction, that form where aesthetic
balance replaced dynamic deployment
of shapes. He requires too little of the
viewer; one, composed of vertical slats
colored differently on opposite sides,
merely requires you to walk to and
fro and watch the graduated changes.
As with the pace-making trio, Har-
par, McGillick, and Schlicht at the
Central Gallery, one is rather expected
to leave one’s emotions at home. Any-
thing that approaches a literary re-
sponse or associational interpretations
is regarded as irrelevantly philistine.
Abstract purists incline to think
people incapable of distinguishing be-
tween aesthetic qualities and irrelevant
responses, but surely that’s what aesthe-
tics has long been about? In any case,
if Ostoja doesn’t ring the emotions he
so rinses the eyes that outside the
gallery the world looks dingy.
Through Coburn looks a little like
Ostoja and the Central trio, he is
really, in his abstracted shapes, con-
cerned with the refinement of associa-
tional effects; his glowing discs,
levitated oblongs and foliage, met-
morphosised into antennae, float on opti-
optimistic blues or warming crimsons.
He seems to have calculated just how
much emotion his symbols may evoke
and just how much his personal touch
is relevant. His finest work and as
fine as any around for a while is
of leaf and limb forms in black on
white, or, since negative and positive
shapes don’t exist in this work, the
white seems to give birth to the black.
The subtlety in the rhythm of forms,
the restrained waywardness of the
contours, and the sheer varied inven-
tiveness in the shapes makes it a local
artistic triumph. Such is the refined,
undramatic, power that it makes many
recent highly colored abstracts look
gaudy and pushful.
For Coburn the sign is still a symbol
of the feelings not an advertisement
for the personality and his shapes
signal a real sensibility at work.
Jan Senbergs, winner of the 1965
Rubinstein, deals with abstract shapes
that have none of Ostoja’s dandyism
or Coburn’s crispness; he arouses too
many associations, starts too many
hares with oleaginous machine-like
shapes that melt and slide into one
another, like a flaccid cubism going
hermaphroditic. His serigraphs, how-
ever, are of a dry, still restraint, and
were I a critic’s doctor I should pre-
scribe oil painting on absorbent
Japanese rice paper, because a real
artist lurks behind these lugubrious,
amorphous oil paintings, embalmed in
a viscous, shiny goo, that doesn’t
always succeed when its master, Len
French, uses it.

Maltese Falcon” and “The Big Sleep.”
Raymond Chandler said, when speaking
of his work, that “the principle was
that when you were in doubt what to
do next, you opened a door on a man
with a gun in his hand.” Director Jack
Smight has learned this lesson well, and
the film moves briskly and excitingly
along, with picturesquely sinister char-
acters turning up every minute and a
thug armed with a gun or bludgeon
round every corner. Lew Harper, a
private detective of the tough-romantic
school, accepts as a favor to a friend
the thankless task of finding a missing
millionaire who turns out to have been
kidnapped. The millionaire, as well as
being alcoholic, suffers from a bitter,
crippled wife, a randy teenage daughter,
and connections with practically every
undesirable character in California.
The basic idea of “The Hallelujah
Trail” is funny enough. It is about the
efforts of a distracted U.S. Army colonel
in the great days of the West to convoy
a wagon train of assorted booze across
the desert in defiance of Indians, sand-
storms, discontented Irish teamsters, and
militant temperance ladies. But it’s not
quite robust enough to bear the weight
of a three-hour running time and Cine-
rama. The deadpan commentary is
amusing, and the battle in the sand-
storm is a hilarious pi'ece of confusion
but the story’s frail fabric soon starts
to creak.

THEATRE
Solo Performance
Night of the Ding Dong. Ralph Peter-
son. SATC, Teachers’ College
Theatre, Adelaide.
A Night At the Old Bull and Bush.
Australia Hotel, Adelaide.
“XTIGHT OF THE DING DONG”
is the South Australian Theatre
Company’s first production this
year (“Royal Hunt of the Sun” was a
joint production with the Elizabethan
for the Festival). It is the company’s
fifth production in two years, the first
and last for this year.
Understandably, this is very dis-
appointing to those who thought that
with the establishment of the company
by the Trust, and with the appoint-
ment of its director, John Tasker,
Adelaide would have a professional
repertory theatre performing at the
very least for three or four months of
the year a repertoire of perhaps half
a dozen stimulating plays and using
some of the city’s acting talent. The
situation is even more dismal when one
learns that the total production budget
of the company this year was $4OOO,
a large part of which has to go on rent-
ing the fine Adelaide Teachers’ College
Theatre, which, in turn, is available
only from the end of second term.
If the company is to succeed, it must
have a reasonable yearly budget; and,
to save a large amount of this being
wasted on rents, it must eventually have
its own theatre. A company which
exists to present one play a year is no
company at all, just sound and fury.
“Night of the Ding Dong” arrived
back in Adelaide to a theatre especially
papered for the occasion. It is a play,
which will probably pay quite well. It
did on tour in the other States,
and in Adelaide there is a large, form-
idable group of theatregoers who will
find the play precisely to their taste;
it is set in Adelaide, it drops local
family names, it is moderately and
innocently funny, and it is produced
with style, speed, and a strident pitch.
Mr. Tasker has directed a number of
the actors before, and this has resulted
in a much firmer control of manner-
isms, though one would wish he gave
more attention to Allen Bickford, who
has three set intonations which he
used almost in rotation. Dennis Olsen
is perhaps the most appealing actor in
the company; he has good timing and
clear delivery, and in this play dis-
plays a capacity for comedy which
could only be the result of a good deal
of subtlety and taste.
John Edmund is the director of
“Theatre 62,” an Adelaide company
with its own theatre. He is an accom-
plished producer and a strong actor,
and one expected his “Night at the Old
Bull and Bush” to display qualities in
line with his professional approach.
Unfortunately, it did not. He had a
very bad script and only a moderately
skilled cast. It is a night of song, dance,
and Victorian melodrama sent up; a
more than usually elaborate floorshow,
ideal for the expense account stratum.

Where’s Daddy? William Inge. En-
semble, Sydney.
Bachelor Girls. Lanford Wilson. Q
Lunch-hour Theatre, Sydney.
“II THERE’S DADDY?” is an
yy American comedy about the
desperate plight of the younger
generation trying frantically to rebel
against the almost non-existent re-
straints of a generation of infinitely
permissive parents.
Tom and Teena, a very young couple,
are expecting a baby. Having rejected
the older generation and all their values,
they have only their psycho-analysts
for guidance. But these oracles are not
always easy to interpret. Tom decides
that he and Teena are insufficiently
mature for parental responsibility and
must separate and have the baby
adopted. Meanwhile Teena’s mother
tries desperately hard to “understand.”
In the end, of course, nature reasserts
itself and all is well.
“Bachelor Girls” is an even more
heart-string-tugging comedy, about two
office girls who share an apartment in
New York. One has too many boy-
friends and the other has too few.
Both of these plays contain that odd
mixture of sophistication and senti-
mentality which is characteristic of
American middlebrow comedy. Of both
plays we are assured in the programs
Amber' Mae Cecil and Janice Copland.
“Bachelor Girls” Q Group, Sydney.
that they could have happened here.
“The play is set in present-day New
York, but it could be Darlinghurst”
writes Hayes Gordon in his note to
“Where’s Daddy?” “Although the play
is set in New York, it is true of any
metropolis, including Sydney” says the
program of “Bachelor Girls.”
I disagree. It seems to me that if we
look at the realistic details of the plays,
the kind of jokes we are to laugh at
and the kind of sadness we are to cry
at, we see that New York is very dif-
ferent from Sydney.
For example, in “Where’s Daddy?”
Gary Shearston and Larraine Gore
succeed quite well in presenting a
couple of mixed-up young people with-
out attempting to Americanise them.
But then Mrs. Bigelow, Teena’s mother,
is as American as the stars and stripes
and Jasmine Greenfield tries valiantly
to do her realistically. At once there
is a confusion of styles.
In “Bachelor Girls” Janice Copland
gives a sensitive performance as the
good-hearted girl who hides her kind-
ness beneath her clowning. She is a
well-known literary type. But Amber
Mae Cecil is much less at ease as the
typically mixed-up American girl who
worries about whether she should go to
an analyst and tries to give herself a
Rorschach test with splodges of nail
polish.
Producers would surely be wiser to
face up to the problems involved in
staging American plays here, than to
pretend they do not exist.

The Dreadful Fate of HMS Revenge.

AS the Music Hall is already advis-
ing its loyal customers to book
early for Christmas, it would
hardly matter what anyone said about
its latest production.
This time producer John Faassen has
returned to the solid British melodrama
of the mid-19th century, on which the
Music Hall was built, after his flirta-
tion with late 19th-century French
farce. Instead of generally making fun
of Victorian sentimentality, he has
aimed for one target, a pretty broad
one the excessive patriotism of the
heyday of the British Empire. With
hardly a squeak left in the poor old
British lion now, it might seem late in

You don't have to be BIG to go in for
telephone automation: Just progressive
Many of Australia's biggest enterprises have
switched to the automated efficiency of STC
Pentaconta Pushbutton PABX. But so, also,
have many up-and-coming forward-thinking
companies. For good reason. It's the most
advanced business telephone system there
is. It saves money. And it's a system which
can start small and be expanded as a
business grows.
What immediate advantages does Penta-
conta bring? Simplified pushbutton switch-
board operation (which often means staff
savings) plus a big speed-up in internal and
external communications. Time and tempers
are saved. (Which often means orders and
profits are saved !) And the smooth, swift
efficiency with which calls are handled
makes a big impression on every caller.
Pentaconta is the automatic telephone
exchange to meet the needs of the
growing business. Installations are available
from a small, 20-line unit to a system
to smt any business and its potential.

the four things
to look for in
storage
racking
m
j
STRENGTH. When you’re buying racking, plan for future require-
ments. You'll need good, strong racking that can carry anything,
whose stability increases with load.
FLEXIBILITY. Good racking has to be adaptable and preferably
self-locking. It is also important that it can be readily re-arranged
by your own staff to accommodate any sized products. There
should be no nuts or bolts to meddle with—they are time wasters.
PRICE. Truly efficient design produces the least expensive rack-
ing. Make sure that the price you pay will buy racking that will
do your job today . . . and tomorrow!
ADVICE. The more your rack supplier knows about your storage
problem the more chance he has of solving it. Acrow have the

The whole is held together by pro-

enough changes of pace to pull through

PATRICIA ROLFE
TELEVISION
Quaint Notion
LAST week some people connected
with television offered the not
unusual opinion that a television
critic should know “just as much about
the medium as the writer or actor or
producer.” As well as being too charit-
able to say how little that might be,
on the visible evidence, I find the no-
tion as quaint as expecting a literary
critic to know all about printing, book-
binding, and distribution. A reviewer’s
business is with the product he sees on
the screen, not with how or why it got
that way, except as matters of passing
interest. He reports to readers who want
to know whether, and why, he thinks
a show is worth watching or not. People
who find they mostly agree with him
may take notice of his opinions, people
who find they mostly disagree carefully
ignore him.
In the past I have praised Graham
Kennedy for his command of the
medium, and particularly for his good
use of self-deprecating and throwaway
humor, but Sydney people rejected his
shows en masse. He was back last week
in a full “In Melbourne Tonight,” and
early reports indicate a more success-
ful impact. This time Kennedy’s unique
way of handling commercials could be
enjoyed at length, especially welcome
if one had previously suffered an hour
of the normal filmed ones on the “Mavis
Bramston Show.” The usual awful
sketch was present in “IMT,” allowing
Kennedy to make his usual asides, such
as “I wish I wasn’t here!” Once again
I recommend at least one viewing.
On the same night, instead of rush-
ing out to the ABC Television studios
to see why they manage to make such
a hash of some “Australian Playhouse”
episodes, or to ATN7 to discover why
“My Name’s McGooley” has to be
played in slow motion, I watched
British half-hour shows “Pardon the
Expression,” “Little Big Business,” and
“McGooley,” all similarly using fairly
threadbare plots and reaching for a
general air of amiable charm. The first
show, with Arthur Lowe of “Coronation
Street” as an assistant store manager
striving for economies and turning off
the wrong electricity, marooning his
bosses in a lift, was very ho-hum in-
stead of ho-ho. The second, with David
Kossoff as retired owner of a firm of
furniture manufacturers who interferes
with his son’s management, perhaps un-
intentionally—who knows? when the
writer does not clarify the point—is
less than a near miss. And the third,
our own, stands up well in this feeble
company. I have heard good comments
on it.
On second viewing after some weeks
it remains so much less than it should
be that its vague charm is lost on me.
The strength lies in the work of those
acting the subsidiary characters, John
Meillon and Judi Farr. The weakness
is in the extended mugging allowed
the “star,” Gordon Chater, adding to
his failure to be comical. When writer
and producer Ralph Peterson sees this
on his TV screen, and realises what he
is seeing, he may subdue Chater, build
up the family situation comedy between
Meillon and Farr, and perhaps show
us a few more of those “people of
Balmain” who are always thanked but
seldom appear. Otherwise the Channel
7 stations will have to find another
show to fill their monthly two hours of
drama quota next year,

Sunday Service in the Deep South
When there was no room in the motel
By PETER BARNETT
WHEN Elizabeth, our hostess’
negro cook in North Carolina,
asked us to her church on Sunday
morning, we promptly agreed. It was
her day off and she called for us in her
car a special Ford, with nylon up-
holstery and wood panelling. Elizabeth
wearing a pink floral dress with a
pink hat was accompanied by her
shy 15-year-old daughter, Pearl, the
youngest of eight.
We drove thirty miles to a town
called Raeford, where the bishop of
Elizabeth’s church was to give a special
Mother’s Day service. We passed
through fields of green wheat and
barley and peach orchards where late
blossoms still clung to a few trees.
On the sandy outskirts of Raeford
we turned down a narrow street and
there was St. James’ Gospel Church. It
was a small, neat, white building. In-
side, below a central pulpit, was a silk
banner, “Prayer Changes Things.”
Above, glistened a plastic chandelier.
On the walls were bright reproductions
on velvet of “The Last Supper” and
“Light of the World.”
We sat with' Elizabeth in the back, as
the church quickly filled. Just before
the service began a woman usher came
to us. “Praise the Lord,” she said.
“Would you like to shift up to a front
pew?”'We sat in the third row, white
faces in a sea of black.
The usher gave us a fan. On the
back read: “Buie’s Funeral Home. Ser-
vice Better than Average. Join Our
Mutual Charitable Burial League.”
As you looked around, you saw a
predominantly female congregation,
most of them wearing straw hats. There
were entire families stretched out along
a pew. But it was the children who
made the lasting impression shining
faces, with eyes and smiles that lit up
as soon as they saw you: the boys with
their tight, crinkly hair, the girls with
pigtails shooting
out at right angles
to their h^ads.
Behind the pul-
pit the choir had
assembled about
20 men and
women dressed in
white. A man
began chanting.
The next moment
the entire building
was filled with
magnificent four-
part harmony, as
the congregation
sang, “Every Time
I Feel the Spirit.”
As the music
stopped a woman
in the front row
flung herself on
her knees and be-
gan crying out in
a synco pat e d
rhythm. The con-
gregration moved
forward and
gathered around
her.
“She’s got the
Spirit,” Elizabeth
explained. The
crowd joined in
with “Yeah,
Lord,” in an ir-
regular chorus.
Soon the woman
was gasping for
breath and the
sweat ran down
her face. The
emotion subsided
and we moved
back to the pews.
I hadn’t understood a word she had
said. I’m not sure anyone else had,
either. From somewhere the solo voice
sounded again. This time the rafters
rang to “Send Down the Rain.”
At this stage, the Bishop, Right Rev-
erand J. A. Jackson, made his appear-
ance. He was a thin man, dressed in a
black gown and he wore glasses. First
he welcomed “our white brothers” and
from among the congregation, women
cried, “Praise the Lord.” He asked us
to stand one by one and introduce our-
selves. There was a genuine sense of
welcome, with applause when each of
us had spoken.
The bishop asked if anyone wanted
to testify. A white-haired woman rose
and in a thick Southern accent spoke
of some miracle that had occurred in
her life. Again “Praise the Lord” from
the congregation.
An old man, immaculately dressed in
a white suit with white buckskin shoes,
shuffled forward. He carried one of the
fans in his hand and sang out the first
line of the hymn “I’ll Pray For You,
if You’ll Pray for Me.” Immediately
the congregation joined in. His voice
rose above all others as the rich sing-
ing resounded. All the while the old
man, vibrating like a machine, shuffled
forward, fanning himself briskly in time
to the music. I noticed there was a
musical accompaniment. In the corner,
a well-dressed matron, with a standard
straw hat and smart slanting glasses,
was playing a kettle drum.
Behind me, a man had brought out
a trombone. Farther back there was a
bass drum and a man with two car
hub caps used as cymbals. A score of
children had tambourines, which they
beat with precise rhythm.
'J'HE old man stopped and the choir,
with rasping voices, began the
hymn, “Nothing But the Blood of
Jesus.”
It was hot. Fans were waving in time
to the beat, and the music was getting
louder and faster. Bishop Jackson was
standing in the pulpit now, leading the
singing. His face was alive with ex-
pression, and he waved his arms expan-
sively.
The music was gaining momentum,
like a vehicle out of control. Suddenly
a woman behind me screamed in
ecstasy. The woman in the front row
who earlier had “had the Spirit” was
sobbing. The noise was deafening.
The bishop was getting increasingly
the congregation stopped singing and
sat down. Around me, men and women
were panting for breath, and the air
seemed thick with the smell of perfume
and bodies.
This was the time for the sermon.
The theme, Bishop Jackson told us,

was “the valya of merthers” (the value
of mothers). “I’ve got nothing for the
fathers, because Father’s Day is coming
right soon,” he said, and the congrega-
tion laughed.
It was a rare experience to watch
Bishop Jackson arouse his flock. The
sermon lasted for an hour and ten
minutes. It started in a low key. He
punctuated each sentence, each phrase
with “Amen,” and soon he started to
catch his breath every few seconds in
a regular beat. His voice was forceful
and it was difficult to know what he
was saying. He seemed more concerned
with emotion than the message.
Occasionally I grasped glimpses of
meaning. He spoke of man’s debt to
motherhood. “President Washington
had a fine mother,” he cried, “and to-
day President Johnson owes everything
to his gre-e-e-eat mother!”
*His voice rose in pitch as he spoke
of the trials mothers endured in the
home and how they were the back-
bone of society. By now, the congrega-
tion was becoming noticeably moved.
There was constant clapping and a con-
tinual moan of approval. Elizabeth,
next to me, was half singing in a deep
contralto voice.
The Bishop was getting increasingly
excited. He was telling the story of
Christ’s birth, in loud, short, synco-
pated sentences. “There was no room
in the motel!” he bellowed. “No room!
No room! No room!”
was running off his brow and
he was dancing and leaping around
the podium. All of a sudden, he gave
a falsetto screech. His eyes were closed
and his words made no sense. He
seemed in a trance. There was a mo-
ment’s silence, then he gave vent to
some inward emotion, with hearty
laughter that shook his, slender body.
His arms went above his head, and
he opened his eyes.
“Oh, brethren, brethren,” he whis-
pered. “Thank God for our mothers.
Thank God. Where would we be with-
out them today?”
“Amen! Amen! Yeah, Lord!” the
congregation responded.
The trombone emitted some shaky
notes and everyone started a vigorous
“When the Saints Go Marching In.”
Pew by pew, the congregation, singing
lustily all the time, filed to the front
of the church to place contributions in
two big collection plates. I noticed
several five-dollar bills.
Elizabeth leant across and said that
it was time to go. We walked out of
the church, with the procession still
moving. Outside, even above the noise
of the car as we drove off, we could
hear the throbbing chant of “The
Saints.”
It had been an exhausting experience.
We sat silently for several minutes.
Elizabeth was first to speak. “It was
real subdued today,” she remarked.
“Not too many ‘got the Spirit.’ But
then I guess Mother’s Day is a right
solemn occasion.”


How do you design a ‘Millensimus’?
The blueprint of the thousandth Mirrlees K-type diesel
engine—‘Millensimus.’ Its task ? To power the ‘W.D.A.
Southern Cross,’ a Westminster Dredging Co. dredger
working on the Australian coast.
To date, K engines, including the K-major, have
developed more than two million h.p. and secured over
SA77 million business, 67 per cent, of it abroad.
Hawker Siddeley know how.
Hawker Siddeley design and build diesels. Big, rugged
ones from Mirrlees—like the thousandth K-type illustra-
ted. Medium-range ones from Blackstone. Small, compact
ones from Petters and Listers. Diesels with a power span
of 1.5 b.h.p. to 8,500 b.h.p. Diesels that generate horse-
power throughout the world.
K-type diesels are versatile and economical. They power
equipment from trawlers to ferries, power stations to
factories. They are the sole means of electricity generation
in many areas, putting horsepower to work in 150 countries.
But Hawker Siddeley don’t stop at diesels. You find
their products almost everywhere. They go down on
the farm—haul trains —steer and power ships—probe
space—build and equip power stations —roll roads —store
heat —fly people—transform electricity—pack food—fuel
aircraft —and maintain a daily turnover of more than $A2j
million.
Diesel engines are part of this turnover, but only part.
That’s what makes Hawker Siddeley a world-size in-
dustrial group. With group power.

BOOKS
Tragedy for Everybody
By HOWARD JACOBSON
Modern Tragedy. Raymond Williams.
Chatto and Windus. $5.10.
Raymond williams, plodding
into print again, tight-lipped, un-
smiling, socially conscientious,
socially committed, socially perturbed,
and sprawled this time across that
skinny little beast Modern Tragedy.
Or perhaps Modern Tragedy is
sprawled across him. It’s difficult to
tell. At any rate one of them rides
the other to a slow, laborious death
throughout two hundred pages that
seem like two thousand. A kind of
mutual suffocation.
For anyone with the stamina and
the morbid curiosity to watch the
process, there’s a little bonus at the
end of the book, in the shape of a
tragedy. One of Mr. Williams’ own
tragedies; very modern and very tragic.
In short, showing us how to do it. It
must be a tragedy because Mr. Wil-
liams calls it “Koba,” which has the
true tragically titular ring. It’s just
got to be a tragedy, seeing as how
all the characters have ominously New
Testament names, talk a language that
one would like to say no man ever
talked, were it not that Raymond
Williams talks it everywhere, and greet
one another’s deaths with portentous
remarks like: “Whatever we have ex-
pected the end is tragedy,” or, “I have
seen the circle of tragedy,” or, “I will
say tragedy when others say life. I will
say tragedy when others say Koba.”
Just as we say “Phooee!” whenever Ray-
mond Williams says tragedy.
Not because he can’t write it, but
because he can’t write it as only a man
who can’t read it can’t write it. For
Mr. Williams’ own little tragedy is the'
fruit of long, hard, and ponderous years
of inability to read anyone else’s.
Tragedy for Mr. Williams is, in the
case of modern drama, what you get
in the last five minutes, the dig in the
ribs, the explicit pointing out of what
it is you’ve just been watching, just
as in the case of an earlier and greater
drama, it is what Mr. Williams is able
to extract as its social moral and
message. You don’t experience tragedy,
you paraphrase it; or, if you’re lucky,
the tragedian will paraphrase it for you.
But then, when you’ve got it, what
do you do with it? Mr. Williams wrote
Koba. And, indeed, the distinction of
that is to be a play without people and
without action; it simply epitomises
itself, spells out, from the first line to
the last, the moral and meaning of an
action that hasn’t occurred, and the
significance of people who haven’t
appeared. “I see a loss of language,”
says someone or other, somewhere in
Koba, “with which I can speak to
my friends.” And no one reading
Koba, could doubt the truth of that.
Mr. Williams is elephantine, but he
is never trivial. He is serious and
earnest. Which makes the spectacle all
the more depressing. Utility. Utility.
Firmly, resolutely, he asks: When we’ve
screwed our moral out of our Tragedy,
when we see that it really means, what
useful function will it serve? Answer:
Not much of a one. Therefore: Litera-
ture, socially dangerous. That,
essentially, is the thesis of Modern
Tragedy.
Poor Raymond Williams, he won’t
admit that literature terrifies him.
Having found himself a cultured man
and an academic, he lets off steam
about literature’s being man’s highest
form of expression. But deep down he
doesn’t believe it. Deep down he
despises it.
“In an ordinary life, spanning the
middle years of the twentieth cen-
tury,” he confesses, to our embarrass-
ment, “I have known what I believe to
be tragedy, in several forms. It has
not been the death of princes; it has
been at once more personal and more
general ... I have known tragedy in
the life of a man driven back to
silence, in an unregarded working
life. In his ordinary and private death,
I saw a terrifying loss of connection
between men, and even between father
and son . . .”
A social visionary, like Blake? Or
Bob Dylan? Anyway, Raymond Wil-
liams would probably see little to
sneer at in that collocation, culture
being, in so far as I could gather from
his earlier work, anything that any-
body does, just as tragedy, as I gather
from this, is whatever anybody suffers.
What could be more humane? All that
happens is life? Push that far enough
and who pushes it further than Ray-
mond Williams? and you have
something quite sublime in its way.
The sanctity of the everyday.
“Ordinary” life, as Mr. Williams calls
it. He has made himself the high-priest
of the “ordinary,” the usual, the un-
exceptional. And you can understand
the appeal. For all we disbelieve, for
all we’re utterly cynical at the core,
let’s ,at least be humane. It’s the final
stage of the fatigue of the spirit.
B U .T Raymond Williams won’t admit
it’s fatigue. He must inject an ex-
citement. “An unusual revolutionary
activity,” is what he advocates at the
end of his earlier book, “The Long
Revolution.” And what does that turn
out to be? 4< Open discussion, extending
relationships, and the practical shaping
of institutions.”
An exciting prospect. Every street
corner a Hyde Park, practical religion,
better universities, elasticated marriages.
What more could the human spirit
aspire to?
Thus tragedy: when we’re ordered to
keep quiet, or we’ve nothing more to
openly discuss; or when the elastic
snaps. And thus is Mr. Williams hurt,
when tragedians don’t show interest,
when they don’t agree that all that
happens really is life, just because a lot
of people do it, or have it done to them.
And so it’s hateful to him, the great
tragedy that we have. Full of aristo-
crats, people breaking out from the
social order, wherein is Raymond Wil-
liams’ only hope. So let’s have tragedy
for everybody. The great democratic
principle!
It’s not spectacular, but at least it’s
safe. Let tragedy be the licking of one
another’s wounds; reciprocal pity.
That then is the conclusion of Mr.
Williams’ fourth book on nineteenth and
twentieth century literature. Not be-
lieving in it at all really, but paying
lip service to the old forms, to the
weary idea that it might, at least, “ex-
tend relationships.” And to the sheer
flaccidity of expression of that hope,
even the most rampant cynicism would
be preferable. At the moment, anyway,
that is all we seem to have to choose
between.
I’ll be Gone
My house may stand,
the iron roof intact;
the desert might
withdraw its cutting edge
of sharp serration,
but I’ll be gone.
Our joy might be
recaptured strangely some day,
come to grips
in one or other room
here in my house,
For I’ll be gone.
Why should I care
when cattle die of thirst
and thorn the land
with cruel nests of bone?
Why should I care?
For I’ll be gone.
What if the desert
never does withdraw,
but presses hard
to hone its blade of ridges,
whittling down the house?
I shall be gone.

The True Novel
By GEOFFREY LEHMANN
The Magus. John Fowles. Jonathan
Cape. $3.85.
THIS novel by John Fowdes, the
author of “The Collector,” is an
amazing virtuoso piece and a
strange and most fascinating book.
It ramifies like a great maze. Each
apparent clearing is in fact the signal
for a thickening of the tangle. Com-
plication is added to complication,
duplicity to duplicity. And there is no
escape from the labyrinth. Each exit
becomes the entry to another maze.
Most of us have at some time when
young relied on a schoolmaster or
older person as a spiritual guide or
mentor. In “The Magus,” a cultured
and older man instructs a young man
in what he sees as being the nature of
life by presenting the young man wdth
an elaborate masque, taking place over
a couple of months, symbolically re-
enacting the old man’s life and defining
his world view. Fowdes is essentially a
novelist of ideas, but he always man-
ages to turn his ideas into flesh and
blood people, who can grip the reader's
attention. “The Magus” is a morality
play, w'hich Fowdes, because of his
great narrative gift, is able to turn into
a mystery story.
The book begins in a matter-of-fact
manner. Nicholas Urfe, the son of a
brigadier, and a third-class honors
graduate from Oxford, has an affair
in London with Alison Kelly, an Aus-
tralian girl who is a good sort, but
whose blonde and sun-tanned sensuality
disguises hankerings after something
more solid and substantial. Alison is
Nicholas’ bond with the real world.
She is completely credible except for
a few bizarre Australianisms.
Nicholas leaves her and goes to a
Greek island to teach. He embarks on
a life of sunlit boredom, cut off from
all stimulation in a large English-type
public school, alternating between
classroom rituals and melancholy
strolls beneath conifers.
Up to this point there have been
only hints of the strange events to
come, but now the tone shifts subtly
and compellingly on to a different
level.
Alison, like one of Henry James’
Americans in Europe, has been lament-
'ng the loss of her large Australian
simplicities in the petty class-conscious-
ness of London, and now the author,
with a Jamesian inevitability, begins
to people his uneventful Greek island
with mysterious footsteps, unearthly
snatches of music, strange comings
and goings. Nicholas meets Maurice
Gonchis, a wealthy aging Anglo-Greek
who lives in a secluded section of the
Hand and who has a Picasso-like
charm and mercuriality and a strong
feeling for profundity and vaudeville.
Maurice becomes a bit of a father
figure to Nicholas and converses with
him and plays on the harpsichord for
him, and sentence by sentence and
note by note an invisible labyrinth be-
gins to form around Nicholas.
n , i . at- i i -i
Each weekend Nicholas is drawn
, , . . , , . ... .
back to Gonchis white villa to witness
a series of extraordinary events. Conchis
tells Nicholas the supposed story of his
life, and strange figures appear seem-
ingly out of nowhere to act out the
events which Conchis has described.
Nicholas is fascinated by the elaborate
masque, flattered that he should be
the object of so much attention,
uneasy because he feels that he is
being made a fool of, baffled because
he cannot understand how the masque
takes place.
One of the recurrent themes of the
book is the devitalisation of feeling in
contemporary life. Conchis tells the
story of his love for Lily Montgomery
before World War I. Conchis and Lily
rarely ever kissed, but had the most
intense feelings for each other. This is
compared with Nicholas’ easy affairs
with women, and in particular with
Alison. Nicholas, despite his extensive
dabbling with women, has, in fact, had
very few feelings about the whole thing,
for, as Alison puts it, all he is interested
in is ‘‘a bit of tail.”
Conchis presents Nicholas with Lily's
reincarnation in the masque and per-
mils Nicholas to feel as he felt about
Lily. He also presents Nicholas with the
story of a mad old Norwegian woods-
man who used to walk into the sea at
night and talk to God in the loneliness
of the forests. Conchis, as the Magus
or Enlightener, attempts to restore to
Nicholas a religious sense, a realisation
that life and sex are both mysterious
and desperately important. These values
are presented to Nicholas as a counter
to the weary hedonism and pragmatism
which he has fallen into.
This is the benign aspect of the
masque and Nicholas in the first half
is a voluntary participant. However,
he is always pestering after explana-
tions because of his pragmatism and
rationalism, and he cannot accept the
masque for its own sake. Nicholas is
one of those people who always wants
to know' w'hat makes a flower tick.
The malign aspect of the masque then
show's itself and physical violence is
inflicted on Nicholas, so that he be-
comes an unwilling participant, is
humiliated and publicly exposed for
his self-indulgence and lack of guts.
At the end of the story, Nicholas,
like the Ancient Mariner of Coleridge,
emerges spiritually purged.
In a period when British writers such
as Kingsley Amis are jaundiced and
cheesed off, Fowdes makes a headlong
attack on this attitude and reaffirms the
fact that life is an important thing, a
mystery. This novel puts Fowles among
that larger stream of European thinkers
and creative waiters, such as Thomas
Mann and Jung. Despite flaws, this is a
Gulliver of books in Lilliput.

Solitary pleasures: a long
Hot shower, a hotel corridor
In a strange town, a walk in its shopping streets,
Bookshops, a drink in a dim bar,
A night cafeteria, a single bed
With a good reading-light, and silence.
Certainly, these same things also prompt
Anguish, retrospection, the sense of weightlessness
And are bound to do so if they go on for long—
Yet, for a change, it’s good to be alone in a new city
Preferably foreign-speaking, with all its possibilities
That never become actualities, and would be spoilt if they did.
But it is important to be in bed fairly early
Since the time after midnight echoes and is dangerous
And to eat a fair meal, with a couple of whiskies
Before settling down; and best to remember your family
To bless them for absence, and for having made possible
This second honeymoon of bachelorhood
Which, for its whole effect, must be brief:
Not more than a few days, and the first day the best.

The Last Cigarette
By R. G. HOWARD
Italo Svevo: The Man and the Writer.
P. N. Furbank. Seeker & Warburg.
$5.60.
AFTER the brief period of fame
won for him, toward the end of
his life, by the campaigning of
James Joyce and a group of French
critics, Italo Svevo once again became
an obscure figure in literature. But
now, thanks to Seeker & Warburg, who
have published this study by Furbank,
and will soon complete a standard edi-
tion of his works translated into English,
his star appears to be in the ascendant.
Now, perhaps, he will be recognised as
the equal, at least, of Thomas Mann and
Robert Musil.
This new celebrity would, no doubt,
have delighted Svevo just as the first
one did. “Everyone agreed,” writes Fur-
bank, “that Svevo was naively delighted
at his sudden rise to fame, ‘like an
honest shopkeeper who has won the
sweepstake’ as one friend said, and made
a point of not concealing it. ‘He took
the halo which had been offered him
and put it on with his own hands.’ ”
By the same token, adverse criticism
affected him just as deeply, so that for
twenty years after the poor reception
of his second novel he gave up writ-
ing almost completely and devoted him-
self to business. “Write, one must,” he
said. “What one needn’t do is publish.”
He had been publishing at his own
expense, and in 1898 when he made this
decision he had a new wife and daughter
to support.
biography reveals the novels are
all strongly autobiographical. The
changing outlook of his heroes repre-
sents Svevo’s own maturing vision;
indeed it was partly through re-creating
his life in fiction that he achieved the
equanimity and detachment of his old
age.
With his characters he shared such
failings as indolence and jealousy. At
first, like Alfonso in “Una Vita,” he
wanted to correct these and act in
accord with his ideals. But he found
that he had little influence on his
behaviour. This discovery embittered
fiim and he made Alfonso commit
suicide. In his second novel, “Senilita,”
he presented a man whose behaviour is
completely irrational and whose life
is full of disaster, yet this has no de-
pressing effect on him in his case
because he lacks the insight to see his
irrationality. The tone is still better, but
Svevo had clearly seen that if he could
only cease to worry about his lack of
willpower it would no longer be a
liability. By the time he came to write
“La Coscienza di Zeno” he had already
advanced to that state. Instead of bit-
terness we now find an ironic self-
indulgence.
He was born in Trieste in 1861. His
real name was Ettore Schmitz, and the
choice of pen-name (meaning “the
Italian-Swabian”) is attributed by Fur-
bank to “a feeling of being a hybrid,
an Italian by language, an Austrian by
citizenship, and a German by ancestry
and education.” But his deepest allegi-
ance lay with Italy, and it was his joy
at the Italian takeover of Trieste toward
the end of World War I that made
him end his twenty-year abstin-
ence from writing. He set to work on
“La Coscienza di Zeno” and completed
it in two years.
When it came out in 1923 few critics
outside Trieste bothered to review it
an d Svevo was crushed by this repeti-
tion of his early failure. In defiance, or
despair, he sent a copy to James Joyce.
He came to know Joyce in 1907 by
engaging him for private lessons in
English. Joyce read his early work and
declared him to be “an unjustly
attention of Larbaud and Gremieux in
Paris. The Frenchmen were enthusiastic
and by word of mouth and by the pub-
hcation of a special issue of their maga-
zme ’ , Le * avire d Argent, succeeded
in ™. a J ev ° a eri Y-
stimulated, by this success Svevo
wiote a lot in his remaining years—
stones, plays, novellas. He started a
sequel to Zeno but it was to be left
unfinished. In 1928 he was involved i n
a car accident. As he lay dying in bed
b ? asked for a cigarette It was refused
him a " d he murmured That really
would have been the last cigarette.”
In these days of exhaustive biography,
Furbank s sketch of Svevo’s life (only
150 pages) seems meagre indeed. But,
as Furbank himself points out, he is the
first to enter the field and the time will
come later for a definitive biography,

their late 19th-century Western counter-
parts) were asking if it were worth

art on deteriorated specimens, and like
many modern artists, they were con-

attitudes to archaic art. Never so fretful

WRITING IN
THE ’SIXTIES
By RONALD TAFT
DESPITE the fact that Australia, as
a rapidly developing “n e w
country,” would seem to provide
a natural laboratory for sociological
studies, our social scientists have, until
recently, almost completely ignored
social classes, religious and political
behaviour, crime, race discrimination
or demoralisation. Until the ’sos the
task of describing our society and the
intricacies of its structures was left to
historians, who usually stopped well
short of their own contemporary period;
economists, who dealt with a very
limited aspect even of their own field
of interest; journalists, with their off-
the-cuff observations and pronounce-
ments; and overseas writers, who often
merely catered to the Australians’
neurotic need to know what foreigners
think of them.
The ’sos saw a trend in sociological
writing that has continued in an aug-
mented fashion in the ’6os, a “let’s
examine ourselves and find out who
and what we are” drive. Even in the
late ’sos, the best seller on the Aus-
tralian way of life was a journalistic
work, “Australian Accent,” by Pringle.
And when, in 1958, the Australian
Social Science Research Council
decided to appoint a research fellow
to investigate the role of women in
Australia, they chose a British political
scientist-journalist, Norman MacKenzie,
for the job. MacKenzie’s work,
“Women in Australia,” combined
economic and legal facts, careful ob-
servations, and competent writing, and
caused a small ground swell in circles
which are concerned about the status
of women. As if to illustrate the pro-
fessional potentiality of a wife and
mother, Mrs. Jeanne MacKenzie peeled
off an astute “quickie” on Australia
(“Australian Paradox”) while here.
Two most important books on aspects
of the Australian culture that have
been good sellers in recent years are
“Australian Civilization,” a symposium
edited by Peter Coleman, and “The
Lucky Country,” by Donald Horne.
The fact that both Coleman and
Horne have been closely connected
with THE BULLETIN is surely not
just a coincidence; no doubt the ghosts
of the “aggressive Australians” of the
’9os still haunt its editorial offices. But
whereas the earlier approach to Aus-
tralia was hot writing by people who
regarded their emotional involvement
in their country as a self-evident virtue,
the contemporary approach is that of
critical observers. The sharp reaction to
“Australian Civilization” by many local
critics was a manifestation of the per-
turbations associated with the change
“The Lucky Country” seemed to be
less objectionable to the literary types
but the recent publication of Davies
and Encel’s “Australian Society: A
Sociological Introduction” once more
starkly outlined the contrast.
We might as well get used to the
fact that the scientific approach to the
study of Australian society has now
come to stay. This scientific approach
embodied in most of the contributions
in Davies and Encel’s book has a three-
fold aspect: it bases its conclusions
on social data collected in an objec-
tive fashion; it uses its own peculiar
concepts to organise the data; and it
attempts to understand its findings by
comparison with other societies.
Sociology has been making a latter-
day bid in the last 10 years for accep-
tance as a university discipline and as
a result of its recent success, profes-
sional writing is starting to make its
appearance. It is, therefore, becoming
more and more important to keep
literary and armchair observations of
Australian society separate from hon-
est scientific endeavors. Because of the
newness of the field, potential readers,
publishers, and even the authors them-
selves are confused about the purpose
and the intended audience of Australian
sociological works. Some publications,
like “The Lucky Country,” are primarily

various critics.
intended for the general reading public,
some for literate social scientists, as,
for example, Jean Martin’s stimulating
picture of certain migrant groups
(“Refugee Settlers”), and some primar-
ily for fellow sociologists. An important
example of the latter is the recently
founded Australian and New Zealand
Journal of Sociology, which publishes
articles by and for the professionals.
It would not be difficult for a lay
critic to “rubbish” such articles as
“The correlation and social cleavage
and the intensity of intergroup con-
flict,” or “The spatial distribution of
social deviants in Luton,” but the
prqfessional sociologist may well be
delighted by their scientific competence.
With the rapid proliferation of Soci-
ology Departments in universities, Aus-
tralia can look forward to an immediate
increase in the output of both articles
and books dealing with theoretical and
practical issues. Only a limited number
of these will have popular appeal.
To sum up, sociological writing in
the ’6os has manifested an increasing
academic professionalism on the one
hand and some astute contributions to
the literature on Australian society and
culture on the other. So far, the
academic and the semi-popular have
been mixed up together, but signs of
an increasing cleavage are appearing.

BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Fair to Middling
IF company results haven’t been able to jolly the stock-
market along by the end of September, there is no
\ chance of their doing so this year. It will need other
things to lift share prices—if they are to be lifted at all—
before the round of interim company results begins next
February. For by the end of September most of the good
results have come out; the usual reluctance to go into print
when there is a depressing story to be told means that the
last couple of months of the annual report “season” can
tend to be quite depressing, even in good times, as the volume
of bad news outweighs the good.
And this year the news has been only fair-to-middling
during the “good” reporting periods. Last week, for example,
the ratio of higher profits reported over lower ones was
only three to two; apart from the whopping Thiess result,
the rises were less impressive than some of the solid profit
downturns. Even when companies have had impressive
results, the stockmarket has not liked them very much; there
have been many market falls following good profit announce-
ments.
The Thiess rise was an exception—and well justified too,
as the shares are still excellent buying at any price around
90 cents in view ,of the prospects of future Moura coalfield
dividends which have not yet begun to flow to the company.
Overall, local factors do not seem, on balance, likely to carry
the stockmarket along on any surge of enthusiasm; certainly
there is plenty of money around despite the restraints in the
US and UK (but some of it is at least warm if not hot),
and in any event the big fixed interest issues will nab a fair
proportion of that. And unless the Government can convince
the market that the economy is a bit brighter than the Bank
of N.S.W. forecast of business expectations shows (it heeds
more figures like last week’s jump in housing starts and
fewer like those on rising unemployment and less overtime)
things look like remaining fairly dull for a while—unless
the international situation picks up appreciably and that
seems unlikely.
The Fixed-interest Rush
THERE are intriguing implications in the rush into the
fixed-interest borrowing by public companies to grab
what they can of the seasonally increased flow of cash
in the community with even greater energy than they scooped
all the money out of the market in new share issues last year.
The first is the evident one that this sopping up of avaih
able cash will severely limit the chances of an early stock-
market recovery, as potential share buyers (particularly the
institutions) will find increasing quantities of their investible
funds going into these sound and high-yielding industrial
debentures. But not all of them seem likely to get the same
investor response, and there has already been some dis-
cussion of the likely reception for issues like the $lO million
ICIANZ one where the new offering has a greater security
than existing public borrowings.
There are already $24 million in unsecured notes in
ICIANZ, largely raised from institutional sources. The new
debenture issue will naturally decrease the ranking of those
notes; presumably this could prompt some institutional
lenders to seek to switch out of these notes (mostly carrying
6J to 7 percent over longish terms, but with some up to 71-
percent) into the more secure debentures that carry between
7 and 7J percent.
The company seems unlikely to assist such switching, and
the scope for the underwriting broker, J. B. Were and Son,
MEN AND MATTERS
TWO of Sydney’s most “establish-
ment” businessmen can get back
to their practices following last
week’s decision by Sydney magistrate
Mr. J. R. Scarlett that no prima facie
case had been made out against them
in the H. G. Palmer affair.
The two men, both senior partners
of top firms in their professions, are
solicitor B. J. D. Page and accountant
R. N. Cadwallader. They had to attend
Court each day of the committal pro-
ceedings that have dragged on since
June (and which have resulted in com-
mittals of fellow board members and
officers of the company).
The court case has certainly had its
effect on these two men; Mr. Page, a
large man, has lost quite a lot of
weight; Mr. Cadwallader is not well.
Brian Page, the senior partner of
Freehill, Hollingdale and Page, runs
one of the most respectable company
law practices in Sydney; its clients in-
clude the Sydney Stock Exchange.
Apart from the unfortunate spell at
H. G. Palmers from late in 1964 that
caused the recent fuss, he is on some
impressive boards and last year was
appointed a director of the Com-
mercial Banking Co. of Sydney.
R. N. Cadwallader is the senior part-
ner in the long-established firm of
chartered accountants, Cooper Bros. If
this were not respectability enough, his
family are the
Allied Mills Cad-
walladers, with his
brother John the
top man on the
Bank of N.S.W.
board.
It was their
membership of the
MLC board that
brought Mr. Cad-
wallader (with
eight other public
company director-
ships) and Mr. Page (with six
others) together on H. G. Palmers. This
is their only disaster. But not all the
other boards they sit together on are
dynamic successes; both are directors of
Australian National Industries and Re-
investment Australia, whose shares are
both well under par.
THERE’S no business like Royal
Show business and there can be
few better at running it than the
imperturbable Colin Woodfull, the 58-
year-old Director of the Royal Agri-
cultural Society of Victoria, who last
week staged his thirteenth performance
in a row at Flemington. The only tur-
bulence, as usual, was the weather.
This hit the turnstiles harder than ever
this year.
Woodfull, a city man born and bred,
Scarlett, SM.
C. Woodfull
G. P. H. Wilson
stepped easily from Wesley and a legal
practice into the show ring and has
devoted special energies there to bring
in the city multitudes, until today they
seem more at home in the hectic
bazaar than country people. Perhaps
the affair is now too commercialised,
but then there is more free entertain-
ment, too (free batting instruction from
test cricketers reflects where the true-
Woodfull family interest lies).
Mr. Woodfull intends to continue his
long innings at the RAS. He is in no
danger of running out of partners. At
the crease as RAS president with him
the last three years has been old Gee-
long Grammar man George P. H.
Wilson, ten years his junior and a big
dairy farmer in Gippsland. He farms a
property at Berwick his forebears first
settled in 1854.


to do so may be limited, suggesting that some institutions
may consequently prefer to avoid the issue despite its J
percent edge on BHP’s modestly priced offering—an offering
which, by the way, will return most life office investors less
on their funds than the current yield available on Common-
wealth bonds, but which has attracted a heavy institutional
subscription for a variety of barely convincing reasons.
Another problem facing the ICIANZ issue is that it repre-
sents a break in the turn and turn about between the two
Melbourne stockbrokers lan Potter & Co. and J. B. Were
& Son for the ICIANZ business; this is the second Were
money-raising in a row for the company.
One thing is clear. With British investors (including
parent companies) so positively prevented from participating
in these issues, they will present a greater strain on the local
market for money than did last year’s comparable flood of
new share issues.
Hamstrung Stimulant
THERE are serious implications in last week’s suggestion
bv an official short-term money market operator that
Australia has effectively lost the use of monetary policy
as an economic stimulant because of persistent high
interest rates overseas. The operator, Trans City Discounts
Pty. Ltd., says that there are “very real restrictions placed
on the scope for Australian monetary policy as distinct from
fiscal policy, in the current world financial situation.
“Until the international interest rate structure comes back
from its present high plane, the chance of reducing interest
rates in Australia to correct any shortcomings in the economy
is very small, unless accompanied by strict controls on bor-
rowings by overseas organisations. This conflict between local
and overseas monetary requirements leaves little room for
manoeuvre and fiscal policy is forced to err on the side of
conservatism lest the situation get out of hand. ’
But to conclude that “Australia is a part of a world
monetary system and not as isolated or independent as we
might sometimes wish or believe,” and that therefore our
high interest rates with their dampening impact on the Aus-
tralian economy are the price we should be prepared to pay
for this, seems to go too far. It would take more than a
minor “hot money” flurry and a few capital raisings by local
branches of overseas parent companies to make that proposi-
tion stand up.
We cannot seriously regard ourselves as part of any inter-
national money market; overseas-owned local companies are
borrowing here not because the interest rates are 1 percent
lower than going rates in Pago Pago, but because there is no
money available in other areas —not simply for market
reasons. The Americans have been borrowing here because
of Johnson; the British because of Wilson.
And, in any event, large parts of recent borrowings in
Australia by overseas controlled companies have been fund-
ing operations; Ford, for instance, probably raised very
little new money but displayed normal market caution by
ensuring its supply of cash at a time when it was evident
money would be in short supply for a while to come.
It is intolerable that the incidental use of our small money
market by these overseas groups should so hamstring our
monetary policy that it cannot move in the ways that would
suit this country best. If “strict controls” are needed, to
regulate these money raisings (stricter than the vague “guide-
lines” of last year) in order to keep our monetary policy
alive, they should be applied forthwith.
N.Z. Ban Relaxed
NEW ZEALAND stock exchanges looked a bit happier
last week after the news that the ban on dealing in
overseas shares for local currency was to be relaxed
in a way which would still prevent a drain on the country’s
overseas reserves. However, the former profitable brokers’
business negotiating sales of overseas shares in Australia where
the script is owned by N.Z. residents is still to be banned,
except for switching into other overseas shares or where
the proceeds of a sale are repatriated through the N.Z.
banking system.
THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: The Minister for Labour and
National Service, Mr. Leslie Bury, has had to defend
his August employment figures, which officially showed
54,279 persons registered and 37,432 vacancies; being
interpreted by him they were supposed to indicate
that “the gap between persons registered for employ-
ment and vacancies registered . . . narrowed further
in August,” despite motor industry lay-offs. Seasonal
corrections suggest the reverse position; overtime
working is down also.
Mr. Bury’s previous ministry must feel a good deal
happier since new houses and flats approved in August,
at 11,609, gave the third highest monthly total ever
and a 1343 rise on July . . . The latest overall produc-
tion statistics, however, don’t look exciting, with even
steel and tinplate output growing at a slower rate
for the three months to August.
August trading bank deposits rose by $45.2m. to
$4938.7m. while advances were $34.6m. less at
$2866.2m., thus making the banks more liquid . . .
New life assurance business grew more slowly during
1965-66 6.4 percent against 1964-65’s 13 percent.
For the markets: Some investment enterprise
was being displayed throughout Australian share mar-
kets last week as reliable second-liners were continually
sought. Yet the general atmosphere still looked rather
drab and overall prices wandered back. A little bright-
ness is conveyed by metals and oils, although the
interest can’t be described as particularly ebullient
most price advances are narrow.
A measure of technical support may have returned
to London; any revival is small and accomplished on
greatly reduced volume. A bevy of good interim
reports and Mr. Smith’s statement on Rhodesia helped
on Friday . . . Wall Street appears highly uncertain
and unable to hold almost daily opening enthusiasm.
For companies: With the ease of superiority

ing day . . . Mr. Staniforth Ricketson begged the

offer for F. W. Williams made jointly by stockbrokers
King atid Yuill B. S. White and Co. was quickly
withdrawn, leaving the original Martin Corporation
bid still available to shareholders . . . Since New'
Zealand’s Tasman Pulp and Paper proposes to export
kraft linerboard to Australia, Australian Paper Man-
ufacturers will cancel an agreement to buy kraft pulp
from Tasman.
Nickel in profusion graces Western Mining Cor-
poration’s Kambalda (WA) deposits, more than a

not be tax-free ... Oil Drilling and Exploration pro-

AUSTRALIAN CONSOLIDATED INDUSTRIES LIMITED
Registered Office: 500 Bourke Street, Melbourne, Victoria
ADDRESS OF THE CHAIRMAN OF DIRECTORS (Mr. J. A. FORREST)
AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS ON
WEDNESDAY, 21st SEPTEMBER, 1966
Ladies and Gentlemen,
With your approval, I should like now to address you on the
position of the affairs of the Company and on its results for the
year which ended on 31st March, 1966. Before doing so, however,
I should refer to a change on the Board of Directors which has
occurred since our last Meeting. In December, Mr. R. G. C. Parry
Okeden, C.M.G., C.8.E., joined the Board. He is with us here today.
Two members of the Board regret being unable to attend the
Meeting. They are Mr. G. Gordon Russell and Mr. T. M. Ramsay.
Both are overseas on business.
REVIEW OF ACCOUNTS
The Accounts and Balance Sheet for 1966 along with the relevant
reports and statements have been circulated to all shareholders and
you will, no doubt, have taken the opportunity to read and study
them.
The Group Net Profit for 1966 after providing for income taxes
aggregated $10,497,000 compared with $9,927,000 for the previous
year. 1966 was another year of stiff competition for a large range
of our products both from local sources and from imports and
in the circumstances the result is considered satisfactory. The
amount of income due to outside minority shareholders in the
several subsidiaries not wholly owned by the Company was this
year $887,000 compared with $1,106,000 last year. The main cause
of this reduction was the lower profit in Australian Window Glass
Proprietary Limited whose results for the year were affected by
slackness in the industries served by them.
Transfers made by certain companies to General Reserves this
year were $1,234,000 compared with $1,136,000 transferred last year.
The profits remaining unappropriated this year are $4,578,000 com-
pared with $3,763 000 at the close of 1965. Group General Reserves
of $29,684,000 at the end of this year compare with $27,464,000 last
year.
SHAREHOLDERS’ FUNDS
During the year Shareholders’ Funds increased
Firstly, toy $3,300,000 of ordinary shares of $2 each
allotted for the purchase of a one-half interest in St.
Regis-ACI Pty. Limited as stated in the Directors’ Report;
and
Secondly, by $4,559,000 of increased reserves and un-
aopropriated profits.
Shareholders’ Funds, at the close of the year, stood at
$107,330,000 in the total of $161,771,000 of funds employed throughout
the Group.
DEBENTURES
In January. 1966. the Board announced its decision to make
an issue of $12,000,000 of debenture stock in the Company in cur-
rencies of five, ten, and fifteen years with the facility of payment
toy instalments if desired. The issue proved attractive and was
filled rapidly by the shareholders to whom it was offered.
At the end of the year. $9,265 000 had been received on debenture
stock account. The remainder of $2,735,000 is the total of instalments
to be received by the end of December, 1966, to make the total
subscription of $12,000,000.
The debenture issue expenses of $270,000 have been written off
by appropriation out of 1566 profits.
CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES
Current Liabilities and Provisions of the Group at the end of
the year stood at $31,187 000 and they were amply covered by
Current Assets of $56,434,000. The Liabilities included a provision for
estimated income taxes payable amounting to $12,516,000 of which
some $4,600,000 remains set aside from 1965 to meet 1985 and some
earher taxes not payable until after 31st March, 1966. Increases
in Debtors and . Stocks during the year were associated mainly with
an overall rise in production and sales, although in the case of
Debtors part of the increase arose from a slowing down of cus-
tomer payments around the end of the financial year. Since then
the average period for outstandings has been reduced.
INVESTMENTS
The total cost of investments held by the Company at the end
of the year was $18,541,00© compared with $13,479,000 for the previous
year. The increase of $5,082,000 was made up mainly of shares
acquired in:
(a) St. Regis-ACT Pty. Ltd. $3,300,000 referred
to a moment ago.
(b) St. Regis-ACI (N.Z.) Limited $525,000 referred
to in the Directors’ Report.
(c) A. V. Wehl Industries Limited $350,000.
(d) Pioneer Industries Limited $165,000.
Shareholders will note with interest that the market value of
the listed investments of the Company is still well in excess of their
cost, despite the prevailing low levels of Stock Exchange prices.
FIXED ASSETS
Earing the year the total gross investment made in fixed assets
was $15,604,000 of which the main portion some $13,950,000 was
devoted to our Australian activities and the remainder overseas. The
major items in Australia included:
(i) Building and plant additions at the Adelaide Glass Con-
tainer works of Australian Glass Manufacturers Company
$1.500 000.
(ii) New buildings and the rebuilding and modernising of the
sheet glass plant at Australian Window Glass Proprietary
..... Limited at Alexahdria, New South Wales $2,500,000.
(iii) The new headquarters building for the Company in Mel-
bourne $2,550,000.
(iv) Additional engineering facilities (including the new engineer-
mg shops at Box Hill, Victoria, and at Caringbah, New
South Wales) $1,100,000.
(v) Additional facilities for plastics production $900,000.
< vl > Sand treatment facility at Mascot, New South Wales
$920,000.
The remainder of the investment in fixed assets was made up
of replacements, modernisation, and extension of facilities throughout
the Group. This large investment in fixed assets enables the Company
to maintain its capacity to supply not onlv an increasing volume of
products, but products of the higher quality required to meet the
modern standards needed by our customers in their operations.
. , Funds for the year’s investment in fixed assets came from
internal sources the debenture stock issue and in the case of the
flnance^t 618 bui * n Melbourne, mainly from long term mortgage
At the end of the year, the Group Fixed Asset total stood at
$86,785,000 after deducting depreciation provisions. Incidentally
while referring to depreciation, we note with disappointment
continuing absence of any income tax allowance for the depreciating
of income-producing buildings. uon
DECIMAL CURRENCY
Our plans for changeover to the new , decimal currency, refers
to last year, worked out well and the conversion throughout th»
Australian operations of the Company was achieved with no great
difficulty or inconvenience either to ourselves or to our customer,
As mentioned last year, we proposed to consider splitting the
£1 shares of the Company into $1 units. Later in this Meeting »
resolution will be submitted to give, effect to this split which m
being passed, will have the immediate effect of changing each’ pi
share both ordinary and preference into two $1 shares. There will hi
no need for shareholders to have their present share certificate,
altered. In future all certificates issued by the Company arising
from transactions after today will, of course, be in $1 terms 8
SUBSIDIARY COMPANIES
The year’s operations of the subsidiaries have been reviewed
by the General Manager in the published report. His report is com
prehensive and it is not necessary for me to add to it.
A s you know already, we are equal partners with St. Regis Paner
Company of New York in St. Regis-ACI Pty. Limited and St Regis-
ACI (N.Z.) Limited. A Technical Aid Agreement with St Regis ha,
been made also. The two companies intend to consolidate and extend
their association and to that end a new A.C.I. subsidiary will be
formed to acquire and further develop the present A.C.I. Australian
plants engaged in the corrugated fibre container business. St Regi,
Paper Company will be a substantial shareholder in the new
subsidiary.
HEADQUARTERS BUILDING
A few days ago, the new building at 550 Bourke Street, Melbourne
was handed over to us complete and most of our staff has moved
I s ?' A ? J ou can imagine, there are still some details requiring atten-
tion before we can say we have settled down in the new premises
The meeting next year will. I hope, be held in the new building
where suitable facilities will be available on the twelfth floor In
the meantime, any shareholders who would like to make an inspection
would be most welcome to do so. Perhaps you could allow us a few
weeks and then get in touch with Management to make a suitable
arrangement.
The building is of modern design and has an attractive appear-
ance. It is over 200 feet high, has a ground floor, twelve upper floors
and a machinery floor. In the basement, there is limited car parking
The occupiable space is over 70,000 square feet of which the Company
will use about two-thirds. Part of the other third has been let already
and prospects are good for obtaining additional tenants.
Recently, the old building at 420 Spencer Street, Melbourne, was
sold and soon, it is expected, we shall dispose of the adjoining
vacant land. J 6
NEW ZEALAND
Economic conditions in New Zealand maintained the buoyancy
noted last year,_ but still with the same pressures from rising internal
costs and deterioration in the national balance of payments situation.
It is expected that the rate of growth in New Zealand will slow down
over the short term future while these pressures are being brought
under control as indeed they must.
The Group operations in New Zealand showed the steady increase
in business and profits expected this time last year. The present year
increase also and while it should finish ahead of 1966, we
expect the rate of improvement to be somewhat less. Those of our
industries which depend on essential imports into New Zealand are
being adversely affected by financial and other restrictions.
SOUTH EAST ASIA
Malayan Containers Limited, the subsidiary which operates
through Singapore Glass Manufacturers Company Limited and
Malayan Fibre Containers Limited, was adversely affected by lower
sales and profits from the Singapore Company during the early
months of the financial year. This situation improved sufficiently
in the second half of the year to enable our Malayan subsidiary to
sh °w. be - tter combined sales and profits than for 1965.
Thai Glass Manufacturers in Bangkok showed the somewhat
lower sales and profit results expected, but they are nevertheless re-
garded as satisfactory.
The results so far for the present financial year in all of our
operations in South East Asia show improvement on the correspond-
ing period of last year. Provided the present conditions of business
stability in the area continue, it is expected that the results for
the full year will be better than those for 1966.
FUTURE PROSPECTS
The Group results for the first five months of the present financial
year are ahead of those of the corresponding period of last year,
t ?? ds t 0 confirm our earlier forecast of a higher profit for
1966/67 than was achieved in 1965/66. However, there is some un-
evenness in the performance of our various subsidiaries. Although
group sales are up and very close to budget, profits, while ahead of
last year, are not up to budget in several instances. There has been
some slackness and hesitation shown in business throughout Aus-
traha m recent months and several industries in which we are
directly interested have been substantially affected, e.g., the motor
and bulld ;ng industries. The full effects of the drought have not
yet been felt, although good rains have fallen over much of Australia.
9 l F? dlt .. lS ~v ery restricted in both Australia and New Zealand and
this situation could continue for some time. Costs are increasing. All
tnis prompts us to take a cautious view of the results for the re-
mainder of our financial year. There are. however, signs of an upward
trend in home building and the further recent mineral and gas
discoveries should bolster confidence. Looking at the situation as
it stands today, we expect results for the year 1966/67 to be rather
better than those for 1965/66. For the long term, we are quite confi-
dent and our plans are for continued growth and expansion.
VOTE OF THANKS TO EMPLOYEES
All people employed in the Group both in Australia and overseas,

PETER SAMUEL'S CANBERRA
Countering Economic Gloom
INADEQUATE public relations look
like causing our economic policy-
makers a good deal of trouble.
For on last week’s economic indicators
the economy is back on the slow, down-
ward slide again.
Mr. McMahon assured us that his
Budget was expansive and on any scien-
tific analysis he was right. Professional
analysts were almost unanimous in the
view that it would inject far more into
the community’s spending streams than
it would take out by way of taxation.
Several university economists went as
far as to say that it was dangerously
expansionary in its implications and
that it would over-stimulate the
economy.
But the great weight of comment —
in newspapers, bank reviews, brokers’
newsletters, and the reaction of lobby
group representatives—was quite dif-
ferent. It took up the catch-ciy that
there was no encouragement to the
private sector, either to consumer
spending or to business. The falsity of
this view has already been argued here
and the point made that the effect of
a Budget cannot be measured solely
by looking at (hanges in tax rates.
lt . . e moment at Uast, the
pessimistic intei pretation prevails and
looks as though it may be having its
own effect on the economy. The Bank
of New South Wales-Chamber of
Manufactures survey of business
opinion paints a dismal picture.
Carried out a couple of weeks after
. -r, , . . , r i , . ,
the Budget, it shows clearly the de-
j ° ’ f . rp.
spondency of management. Ihe pro-
portion of businessmen expecting an
improvement in the general business
situation slumped markedly. In addi-
tion, the number reporting satisfactory
rates of operation declined yet again,
and intentions for the months ahead
reflect the general gloom.
Together with the end-August em-
ployment review of the Department
of Labour, this adds up to the most
pessimistic economic prospect since
late last year. Mr. Bury can quibble
on the theoretical point about
whether one particular seasonal adjust-
ment is reliable or not, but he cannot
sound convincing when every employ-
ment indicator points in the same
direction. Dr. Alan Hall’s adjusters
give a rise in the trend of unemploy-
ment of about 6 percent, and this is
possibly an overestimate. My calcu-
lation puts it at 4 percent. But the
size matters less than the direction,
and this is confirmed by other series.
Vacant jobs declined by a significant
2000 and overtime working was down
a solid 10 percent. Employment in
relatively unseasonal factories dropped
by more than in any month in recent
times.
Now the hope is that this downward
lurch is mainly attributable to dis-
appointment with the Budget and to the
fall in car sales. The September figures
will probably show further falls in em-
ployment because of motor industry
lay-offs; this will be unfortunate for
the Government parties in the election
campaign. They w ill do best to admit
the existence of an easing in the de-
mand for labor and argue that this need
only be temporary because of the ex-
pansive elements in the overall situa-
tion. They can also argue quite validly
that the general level of employment
is good.
The longer-term lesson is that the
Government has to carry out a more
aggressive educational campaign to ex-
plain how and why the Budget will
have its intended impact on the
economy, and not allow gloom to be
spread through mistaken analysis. There
was the basis for a good case in State-
ment Six of the Budget Appendix but
it was simply not used by Government
spokesmen.

The Case for Sliding Parity
AS expected, last week’s meeting
of the International Monetary
Fund did not come up with
any new solutions to the world
liquidity crisis. And the battle to
hold sterling continues.
But there is a growing view that
perhaps the whole idea of rigidly
holding exchange rates of currencies
is wrong and that, with a changed
more flexible system, much of the
current problem would have been
solved.
Not that exchange rates should
run wild; the scheme now being
proposed by a growing band of
economists is that there should be
a maximum movement of two per-
cent a year allowed (either up or
down) in exchange rates on cur-
rencies, which would represent con-
trolled devaluations or revaluations.
This two percent annually would
give scope for substantial adjust-
ments over a number of years, but
would retain one advantage of the
fixed-rate system in providing cer-
tainty of medium-term calculations.
This system would also have a
built-in resistance to disturbance by
speculators because the allowed ex-
change-rate movements vyould be
small enough to be offset by dif-
ferential interest rates, as this article
from the “Economist” shows.
THE present exchange system, en-
shrined in the articles of the
International Monetary Fund, is
known in the trade as the adjustable
peg. Exchanges are pegged at parities
that are fixed in normal circumstances
but adjustable as a last resort as
sterling was, downward, from $4.03 to
$2.80 in 1949, and as the German
mark was, upward, from 23.8 American
cents to 25 American cents in 1961.
The Bank of England is committed
to supply unlimited amounts of dollars
against, sterling to prevent the rate
dipping below $2.78 (and in practice
intervenes well before that point is
reached). Equally, the Bank is com-
mitted to stopping the rate bursting
through its ceiling of $2.82 by supply-
ing unlimited sterling against dollars
when things are running the other
way.
This system, whatever its other ad-
vantages, is a gift to speculators. For
it limits almost to insignificance the
penalty of being wrong. During the
recent sterling pressure, short sellers
who unloaded sterling they had not
got, at £2.78f, in the hope of picking
it up at say $2.30 after a devaluation,
faced at worst the risk of having to
buy instead at $2.81f. They stood to
lose three cents in every pound against
a possible gain of fifty. This is the long-
standing “market” case for greater
flexibility either by abolishing the
limits (alias margins, alias support
points) altogether, which would mean
abolishing the notion of a parity itself:
or by greatly widening the permitted
limits to three, five, or even ten
percent on either side.
But now the snags. If the widening
of margins is kept modest, say to three
percent, then there should be some
gain in countering speculation —pro-
vided the new system is accepted by the
market as there to stay, which it might
not be. But the scope for continuing-
adjustment to help the trade balance
would remain small. If, on the other
hand, margins were made very wide or
abolished entirely—and after a point
the distinction is unimportant - the
authorities would have to look at other
ways of running the system.
Hence the search for a new approach.
The key change that is suggested by
advocates of the scheme known as the
“sliding parity” is that parities shall
be changeable by very small, known
amounts, in a smooth progression - —-
instead of being adjustable by large
and unknown amounts in built-in crisis
situations. In the words of one of the
exponents of the scheme, Dr. John
Williamson, a university lecturer, this
would remove the “aura of cataclysm”
from exchange adjustments.
The changes themselves could be
made yearly, half-yearly, monthly, or
even weekly to a maximum extent
respectively of 2 percent, 1 percent,
one-sixth percent, and one twenty-sixth
percent. This would allow considerable
cumulative changes, ten percent over
five years. If such a movement had
been initiated by Britain in 1961, the
consequent fillip by now to Britain’s
exports and consequent discourage-
ment to its imports might well have
made the current economic crisis much
easier to handle. With this potential,
so the argument goes, countries could
then give much stronger commitments
on avoiding larger changes and
trust in the exchange-rate regime could
actually be strengthened, to the
immense relief of the men of Zurich,
Westminster, Basle, and Washington
alike.
It should also be easier with this
system of flexibility, than it would be
with others, to find safeguards against
competitive or aggressive devaluations.
Countries could still be required to
secure IMF approval for parity
changes, as they are now with the
major advantage that these could be
discussed in advance and contested if
the country was evidently not in basic
payments deficit. Countries might be
given bulk dispensations for, say, a
maximum of 24 or 48 successive
monthly devaluations of one-sixth per-
cent.
The exchange markets and money
markets would then know what they
were in for and could discount it.
This could be done not only through
the forward exchange market, but also
through differential interest rates. Sup-
pose a country had set in train a slide
in its parity. Foreign holders of balances
in this country would then face a total
capital depreciation of 2 percent a
year against currencies that stayed stable
and of 4 percent a year against a cur-
rency who parity was on the upslide.
If the exchange movements continued
for four years, the maximum relative
depreciation would be 8 percent and
16 percent. But the key point is that
these capital losses could be offset and
made good by differences in interest
rates. The depreciating country would
need to maintain rates a shade over 2
percent above the international norm,
and 4 percent above rates in an ap-
preciating country. (This is not fanci-
ful: foreign holders of German marks,
Swiss francs, and French francs have'
for years received no interest on any
bank deposits held in these currencies.)
For the depreciating country there
would, of course, be an additional
interest burden. But this would itself
provide some safety valve against too
carefree a parity slide; and the excess
interest would be likely to be no larger
than has in practice to be conceded
by a currency that is on the defensive
under the present regime. Britain in the
past fifteen years has faced an approxi-
mate doubling of its interest burden
on the sterling balances without the
advantages of depreciation.
No exchange system can combine all
the advantages. The choice is between
the least evils. Any shift from a fixed
rate system would involve a loss in
certainty and stability. The main draw-
back of the sliding parity, as far as
can be judged before it has been tried
out, is its unfamiliarity. Possibly there
may be additional snags that discus-
sion has not yet thrown up. But there
is the strongest possible case for saying
that the discussion should proceed.

Sharing the Economic Cake
By CROESUS
ECONOMISTS on the Arbitration
Commission! Goodness me, what
next. The suggestion comes in
the course of a most intelligent dis-
cussion on the fixation of wages in the
current issue of the IPA’s “Review.”
The unions are horrified at the idea.
Why? Perhaps it’s because, like Dr.
A. R. Hall before it, the Institute puts
its microscope over one of the main
tenets of Mr. Hawke’s economic argu-
ments in this year’s wages case and
finds it wanting. Perhaps the Institute
feels that more rationalisation in wage
fixing could be the thin end of the
wedge in the same spirit as the Trades
Hall in Melbourne thinks the Institute’s
suggestion of doing away with the dis-
pute method of determining award
wages is hitting below the belt.
If the Commission had been blessed
with an economist or two on it this
year, the Institute remarks that evi-
dence relating to the share of GNP
going to wages “might not have been
adopted.” It considers that with econo-
mists on the Commission, it would have
discovered that the statistically adduced
fall of 3.5 percent in the share of GNP
going to wages over the ten years to
1963-64 was suspect as a measure of
the experience of labor’s share of
national production.
Terrible moments of truth hit one as
a financial journalist. Every now and
again, it seems, most usually in the
process of writing last minute copy,
you are told something and haven’t
time to check. I was told, for instance,
on good authority that an article by
Dr. A. R. Hall, of the National Uni-
versity, disputing the validity of these
figures submitted to the Arbitration
Commission was brought to the atten-
tion of the Commission in the closing
stages of this year’s wages case. It
turns out that—surely a lapse on their
part —the employers had failed to do
this and Mr. Hawke rightly rebuked
me for saying that they had done so.
The salt was rubbed into my wounds
in no uncertain fashion when I read
the following passages from the Arbitra-
tion Commission’s judgments.
In his judgment, Mr. Justice Wright
prefaced his expression of “a firm be-
lief that the general level of salaries
prescribed by the Commission over
the past ten to twelve years could justi-
fiably have been fixed at higher levels”
with the following: “Mr. Hawke, the
union’s advocate, justifiably laid great
emphasis on his statistical studies of
the share of GNP going to wages and
salaries and especially on the persistent
downward trend since from 1953-54 to
1963-64.”
In his turn Mr. Justice Gallagher
said that “the necessity of providing
for constancy of shares is a matter to
he taken into account” and that “there
is some evidence that shares may not
have remained constant.” Commis-
sioner Winter was even more forthright,
saying that “the appreciable slump in
the share of GNP falling to wages and
salaries was, at least, significant and,
viewed from certain aspects, might be
said to be alarming ... an attempt
to correct the position should be made.”
The IPA backs up its suggestion that
economists should form part of the
Commission by submitting that a closer
look at the statistics and an expert
analysis would not have sustained the
above views of the justices. With its
awfully long memory it cites an opinion
vented by Professor Prest as far back as
1950 in support. Prest stated, “It is
impossible to derive from the national
income estimate any information about
the rewards paid to a homogeneous
class of laborers as opposed to any
other section of the community and it
is difficult to see what significance can
be attached to the share of national
income paid in salaries and wages
it indicates what part of national in-
come is paid in a particular form, not
what is paid to a particular class.”
First, on broad grounds, the IPA
considers the wage and salary com-
ponent of the detailed figures for the
distribution of GNP (at factor cost) to
be of dubious significance as a measure
of labor’s share of national production.
For one thing, it excludes the large
wages and salaries element in the in-
come of shopkeepers and others working
in their own businesses, the major part
of whose incomes is a reward for work
and not profit in the economic sense.
Moreover, it includes the salaries of
executives, senior public servants, and
people engaged on “brain” work.
J|ORE important than this, however,
says the IPA, the figures showing a
decline in the wage and salary share
of the GNP are themselves misleading.
The fall in the share of GNP going to
wages and salaries is largely explained
by the rises in the shares of deprecia-
tion from 4.5 to 7.6 percent, imputed
dwelling rent from 2.8 to 5.0 percent,
and of profits of public enterprises from
1 to 3 percent.
As the IPA says, assertions that the
wages share of GNP has fallen might
carry with them the implication that
the share of the profits’ component has
risen and that therefore some redistri-
bution in favor of wages is warranted.
But, as it shows, over the ten-year period
profits’ share has dropped from 8.6
to 8 percent of GNP, and the share of
dividends before deduction of personal
tax has fallen from 3.7 to 3.5 percent.
Further, an analysis of the individual
industry components of the GNP reveals
that there has been a remarkable de-
cline in the share of wages and salaries
paid to employees of predominantly
government-owned undertakings, such
as electricity, transport, and communi-
cations, where capital investment has
been substantial from retained profits
accruing from higher charges and
prices. It could hardly be argued, says
the IPA, that this government-induced
“drift” should be consciously reversed
by the Arbitration Commission. Indeed,
the large rise in capital investment per
worker demanded by much modern in-
dustry, both public and private, must
tend to decrease the proportion of the
GNP paid in the form of wages and
salaries though, at the same time, greatly
improve the real income of all wage
and salary earners.

Sir John Allison
TO have started one’s working life
as an office boy and finished it
as about the most respected
economic councillor in the land adds up
to a most satisfying experience. Yet,
whenever I talked with the late Sir
John Allison in recent years it was
to a man completely unaffected by
success, a solid grass-roots citizen, one
unapologetic of a humble background,
The economics of the fellow were
earthy. He told me once he kept a
record of a few basic economic indi-
cators in a small notebook; these suf-
ficed him to keep all the tabs he needed
on the national economic picture
which so vitally affected the business
of Permewan Wright he’d made his
own, and condi-
tioned the econ-
omic advice he
was so frequently
called to give to
governments.
Allison moved
around the nat-
ion a 1 economic
stage with the
same easy com-
manding tread as
he did in the com-
pany world and his personal life. He
was a magnificent figure in them all,
but hardly seemed to be aware of it!
He would say that his eminence was
a sort of accident. He’d climbed to the
top of his company’s executive ladder
by service in Victoria and N.S.W. by
1947, but had not by then come under
national notice. He was soon to do so
as president of the Associated Chambers
of Commerce of Australia, a connec-
tion he was always faithful to.
As the ACCA president he was
called to the Prime Minister’s national
conference on inflation in October,
1951, and it was there that he first
attracted the Government’s attention
for the soundness of his advice. In a
hastily prepared last-minute speech he
adjured the Government to eschew con-
trols and to fight inflation with fiscal
and monetary policy. From that time
onwards he was “in” as an economic
adviser to the Government.
But inflation and shortage of overseas
funds were only two of the Govern-
ment’s major worries at that time.
Menzies brought the word back from
London that Australia would have to be
ready for war within three years. So
in 1953 Allison was made chairman
of the Board of Business Administration,
Department of Defence.
Around this time his value was also
being recognised by Victorian organi-
sations. For instance, from 1952 to
1955 he took on the presidency of the
Melbourne Chamber of Commerce, for
a time doubling this job with that of
the all-Australian body. Then in 1954
somebody “persuaded” him (as he put
it to me) to stand for the Melbourne
City Council.
His other committees from 1954
onwards ranged from the National
Transport Council of Australia, Mel-
bourne University Council, Royal
Commonwealth Society, and Summer
Schools of Business Administration,
Melbourne University, to the Royal
Children’s Hospital.
In later years—and this he always
considered his most important national
work—he was chairman of the Export
Development Council (from 1959). He
saw exports as the crucial factor in
determining Australia’s rate of econo-
mic development, that unless we
achieved a great expansion in them we
were not likely to accumulate sufficient
overseas funds for financing imports on
the scale required to create enough
work opportunities for the additional
population required to develop the
country.

The Paper Roundabout
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
By JASON
WHEN the St. Regis Paper Co. of
the US became a part-owner of
ACl’s substantial fibre container
operations last week and Australian
Paper Manufacturers terminated its
multi-million dollar pulp importing con-
tract with Tasman Pulp, they formed a
pattern of growing significance to the
Australian packaging industry.
Two weeks ago, the implications of
Tasman Pulp’s decision to go into the
kraft paper export business to Aus-
tralia, with a target of 100,000 tons
yearly by 1970, were outlined on this
page; and back in March, the implica-
tions for ACl’s packaging operations of
the St. Regis-ACI link through what
used to be St. Regis-Williams (the
Sisalkraft-Bates group) were also stated
here. Last week’s news about St. Regis
becoming a “substantial” shareholder
in ACl’s fibre packaging subsidiary was
forecast here at that time.
Together these two facts are im-
portant. For it seems of major signi-
ficance that the St. Regis Paper Co.
is now having large volumes of export-
able pulp becoming available from its
North American activities, that St.
Regis-ACI has been appointed Aus-
tralian agent for St. Regis pulp, that
St. Regis operate 13 paper mills, that
APM is now in the market for pulp, and
that St. Regis-ACI and the ACI pack-
aging companies are all customers of
APM.
There seems little doubt that if any-
one could move into Australia in a
significant way in the pulp industry, it
would be St. Regis. Other paper com-
panies like Canada’s MacMillan Bloe-
del and Powell River have looked and
left because of uncertainties over con-
tinuity of wood supplies in South Aus-
tralia, where they had been investigating
prospects. And it is coincidental that
when APM announced two weeks ago
that it had decided not to go on with
its ideas for a pulp plant in the area
and would instead put in a plant, if
one were wanted, at the Apcel Mill,
two of the top men from MacMillan
Bloedel should be in Australia at the
time. But they have definitely pulled
right out, they said. “We are here
simply to talk to some good customers
of ours.” APM could possibly be one.
Whatever all this means for APM,
one thing is clear about ACI; its fibre
packaging operations are now certain
to be on an impressive upswing, for it
will be very much in St. Regis’s best
interests to build up its already strik-
ingly large buying power for packaging
nnd building papers in Australia. Once
Jt obtains a big enough demand base
it would be in an interesting situation
to make the most of it.
The only drawback to investing in
ACI at present is the uncertainty over
the future of the 1.6 million shares in
the company now held by F. W.
Williams as consideration for the sale
of its half interest in St. Regis-
Williams. The fact that St. Regis pre-
ferred to get its “substantial” interest
in ACI directly through the packaging
subsidiaries rather than in buying this
group shareholding seems to suggest
that St. Regis are not potential buyers,
although presumably they are keeping
their eyes on things. But 1.6 million
floating shares or not, ACI looks good.
THE market will not have to wait
too much longer for the local
Consolidated Goldfields float; the
triumvirate of leading brokers handling
the event (two Sydney and one Mel-
bourne) are moving closer to it.
Coming at a time when minerals
prices have been high, coal exports
buoyant and all of the local company’s
operations have been running at healthy
profits, this flotation of a branch of one
of the world’s major mining groups
should be one of the financial events
of the decade.
M ALLEYS may be as keen to get
the Hotpoint range as AEI was
to unload it. AEI has been
withdrawing from appliances both in
Britain and here in recent years, and
with the British company forming a
joint appliance company with EMI
(British Domestic Appliances) the
question was what would happen to
remaining Australian appliances put
out by the Australian AET company.
The local AEI group is struggling to
get back into a strong enough position
to float itself off again.
The Hotpoint range is a good one
and Malleys has the ability to do well
with good products, as its success last
year with the Whirlpool washer shows,
at a time when washing machine pro-
duction was falling by about 7 percent.
Malleys’ prospects in washing machines
look better following the complete
withdrawal of some major rivals from
this product range. The company
turned in a good result last week that
failed to impress the market.
ANOTHER result that did not
impress the market very much
was the good looking 7 percent
profit rise from Grace Bros., which
went right against the retail trend,
was due partly to Roselands and
came after only a very slight rise in
tax. Fears about over-saturation in
suburban shopping. centres may be
reasonable at the moment, with
Bankstown already posing one chal-
lenge to Roselands, but with the major
challenge coming next week when the
Burwood centre opens.
THE market may have overestimated
the impact of the severe drought
in the Hunter River on three com-
panies with large interests there. Linde-
mans have reported (along with their
third bonus in four years and the
promise of more to come) that their
1966 vintages have been most successful
and that “the quality was not only of
the high standard usually associated
with a drought year, but actually
superb” and on top of that the yield
of juice improved and the crop was the
highest since 1948.
Lindemans have proved the advan-
tages of concentrating their operations
in N.S.W. near the major markets;
Penfolds is now substantially expanding
its N.S.W. interests along the same lines,
although Penfolds grows far more of
its own grapes than Lindemans, which
is a large buyer from growers.
ANOTHER Hunter Valley com-
pany to do better than expected
was F. J. Walker, the meat pro-
cessor, whose 27 per cent profit jump
followed heavy kills at its Aberdeen
abattoirs in the four months to June,
just before the drought broke there.
But now that the rains have come, it
seems that Walker’s Aberdeen opera-
tion may have settled down to normal
levels and so might the current
year’s profit.
ONE Hunter Valley company that
has been hard hit by the drought,
with profits and sales “substan-
tially” down at the half-year mark and
with the result for the full year being
released later than usual, nevertheless
may find the drought to have been
something of a blessing in the long run
by forcing it to go into what could be
a profitable pursuit —exporting.
R. and N. Statham, the Newcastle-
based specialist in farming buildings
and equipment, looked for another out-
let for its drought-affected activities and
last month shipped its first consignment
of prefabricated steel buildings to
Libya. The next sections will be on the
way in December.
The drought knocked the company’s
50c shares from a top $l-55 in January,
1965, to 57c early this year; they have
since recovered to around 70c.
R. and N.’s full recovery depends on

nett’s Green, near Newcastle, is busy
working in anticipation of the demands

a record wheat harvest.
IT looks as if the fan industry really
needed the sales tax reduction
from 12-|- percent to 2\ percent
in the last Budget; shares in the two
biggest makers of fans in Australia are
both well and truly under par. .
Fans are only a small proportion of
the business of Australia’s biggest fan
maker, the well diversified electrical and
appliance company Email, whose 50-
cent shares are now around 40 cents.
But they make up about 80 percent of
the value of production of the small
Sydney office supply maker and mer-
chant Celco, whose 50-cent shares have
fallen to around the 20 cent mark while
awaiting news of the extent of 1965-66’s
inevitable profit disaster.
Email, which is by far the indus-
try’s biggest seller, is reorganising its
fan operations all under its Brinsmead
subsidiary, which is now adding
Westinghouse apd Eicon to its own
top-selling products.
Revelair, the Celco fan, is second
on the sales list, well after the Brins-
mead - Email group.
Local fan production has been rising

The Chartist says:
MARRICKVILLE HOLDINGS could certainly not be recommended to buy
on technical grounds at present and it has been featured this week to
illustrate the possible effect of “Mrs. Jones” on the long-term downtrend.
The basic uptrend was broken toward the end of 1962 and the stock would have
been a technical sell about the $2.40 level. From the top price of $3.02 early i n
1962, the stock continued to move in a downtrend channel at a basic rate of 15
percent depreciation per annum until penetration of the 1960 support level above
$1.60 in March, 1965. A sharper downward trend took prices to a low point of
$1.12 and a base appeared to be forming above that level with a rise to $1.55 in
January, 1966. However, over recent months the decline has been renewed at a
much faster rate of depreciation and prices have already fallen to $l.OO It is quite
likely that prices could fall to a shorter term target about 90c, and the possibility
of a further decline to about 75c would also have to be considered when the situation
would call for reassessment. Investors should be mindful of the fact that a strong-
downtrend exists and the stock is technically very weak, partly due to an absence
of support levels under the $l.OO level for at least seven years. Last sale price on
22/9/66 $1.16.

bring fans into, line with heaters, which
seems fair) is not seen as a great
boost to the industry, but more as
some assistance in keeping the figures
moving in the right direction at a time
during which sales levels may have
been under some pressure. The biggest-
selling fans are probably in the $44
range, so the sales tax cut represents
a saving of around $4, which should
have some impact.
Celco is the company whose previous
management last year made a mistake
about profits and stock, made a loss
instead of a forecast profit, and decided
not to pay an already declared divi-
dend. Its new management has set
the coinpany out on a two-year
recovery scheme. The company’s prob-
lems were worsened this year by a six-
week strike. But next year it should
get the benefits of its new building as
well as having brought its problems
closer to solution.
So far the company is only half way
through the two-year recovery program,
and it will take more than a fall in
sales tax on fans to make the accounts
look brighter. But it should help.
WITH the fashion swing in car-
pets toward the Hycraft and
Lochinvar brands made by Car-
pet Manufacturers, the $1 shares
should prove rewarding if purchased
around current levels of $1.20 or less.
Yield is something like 7.5 percent and
starting to draw a lot of income-
minded investors into the stock. For
1965-66 the company has raised divi-
dend from 8 to 9 percent. Earning rate
was 14.6 percent.
There is still a long way to go be-
fore the company recovers the per-
formance levels of pre-1961. The 1960
profit was $400,000 and four successive
lifts since have still only raised the
result to $317,000. The road ahead
looks promising, however, and there
seems little justification for the market
to price the shares so close to par. The
1961 year may be hard to forget, but
carpet trends are swinging the com-
pany’s way, so the future should soon
obliterate this memory.

Firmer Market for Copper
COMING months could see a firm
London Metal Exchange copper
market. Apart from the continu-
ing unrest among Zambia’s miners,
both the U.S. and China have been
buying in recent weeks.
If the three-months contracts are
enforced by the buyers, LME stocks
will be reduced they have already
fallen about 10,000 tons from the re-
cent peak of over 20,000 tons. This
will increase technical and consumer
pressure on prices.
In Zambia, thirty-three mine work-
ers have been arrested and been sent
to rural areas. The focal point of the
dispute is over repayment by the Gov-
ernment of money paid into the miners’
provident scheme now that a national
provident plan has been set up.
When miners stopped work the Gov-
ernment agreed to repay the money,
but only over a period, and this pro-
viso has been the cause of further
difficulties. Certainly there are still
stocks of metal from the Rhodesia rail
blockade, but the copper market is
concerned at the apparent lack of stab-
ility in Zambia’s mines.
Meanwhile, the “Torco” process for
treating copper ore not amenable to
the normal extraction processes has
been declared commercial. Developed
by the Anglo-American group at its
Zambian mines, the process will be of
considerable importance for the copper
industry, opening up large deposits
formerly uneconomic.
Tungsten Ceiling
TUNGSTEN ore prices continue to
rise steadily in London and are
approaching the stage where the
fixed-price sales from U.S. stocks set a
probable ceiling.
After allowing for import duties and
freight, the U.S. consumer will not buy-
on the U.K. market at more than about
290/- stg. a unit (22.41 b. of 100 per-
cent ore, in effect). And ore released
from U.S. stockpiles may be exported,
providing another barrier to price
rises.
The U.S. surplus stocks are vast in
relation to consumption and it seems
unlikely that London prices will be
able to rise much above 3t)o/-. How-
ever, this is a historically high level.
The market, too, shows every sign
of holding up well in the foreseeable
future, w'ith China’s internal conflict
and increased buying by East European
users.
Nickel in Demand
JAPANESE nickel smelters, at
present dependent on New Cale-
donia’s ore, are interested in widen-
ing their supply base. Attention has
first turned to Indonesia, where a small
mine has been financed by Japanese
interests in return for a long-term con-
tract for nickel ore supply. And
recently the Japanese consortium
Sumidec has been considering establish-
ing a smelter in Indonesia.
The development of Australian
deposits has probably attracted
Japanese interest, and the possibility
of a joint effort on local leases has
probably not been neglected.
Meanwhile, the world nickel situa-
tion continues very tight, with rapid
growth of stainless steel in particular
boosting consumption. Output is bein?
raised, but on present indications over-
supply will not be a problem for some
time.
Pig Iron Prices
Prospects for sales of pig i ro t 0
Japan are improving rapidly. The
Japanese Government has with-
drawn steel output limits following the
recovery in domestic demand effecting
a general lift in the economy.
Prices for pig iron have been pushed
up as a result. Within about two weeks
the quotes have moved from $U.5.39-
40 a ton to $46, with $49 in prospect,
according to observers. BHP was said
to have asked $41.50 a ton recently.

MINING
Growth for Asbestos
HIGH on the list of mineral products
in which Australia is not seif-
sufficient is asbestos. Admittedly,
Western Australia produces an export-
able surplus of blue asbestos (croci-
dolite), but imports of white asbestos
(chrysotile) are still a major import
item. Smaller quantities of other types
of asbestos, principally amosite, are
also imported. In 1965 the value of
these imports, at $5.86 million, was
over six and a half times Australia’s
export earnings from blue asbestos.
& .
Although exports grew rapidly m
the 1950 s to. a record of nearly 13,000
shoit tons in 1959, they have since
fallen to levels around 8000 tons
*/ocon "y, S j a Tnil eC^^o S i/^ n
(262. tons) and 1965 (4810 tons;.
However, imports have grown rapidly
end H from
r c rt tor ! s 1 P ri ic t 0 a rec ° rd
° . incr tO P S m Between 1964
and L 65 alone, impoits jumped 20
peicent. About thiee-quaiteis of cur-
rent imports are white asbestos, mostly
rom Canada. South Africa is the next
most important supplier of both white
asbestos and amosite.
At the same time, Australian produc-
tion increased progressively after 1945
to a record of 18,416 short tons in
1962 (including 17,491 tons of blue
asbestos and 925 tons of white asbestos).
Since then it has declined from levels
around 13,000 tons in 1963 and 1964
to 11,746 tons in 1965 (including 10,592
tons of blue asbestos and 1154 tons of
white asbestos). The main reason for
the significant decline in production of
blue asbestos, all of which is from
Western Australia, has been difficult
export, markets together with certain
operating di lculties.
q P r °blem has been made more
acute because of the rapid growth in
consumption of asbestos in Australia,
m hne Wlt * ex P enenc ? in other
countries. World consumption of as-
bestos has been growing at an annual
rate of 7 percent since 1950. In Aus-
tralia, annual consumption has grown
by 55 p ercen t between 1952 and 1964,
when total consumption amounted to
43 300 short tons
The principal use of asbestos fibre
Australia is in the manufacture of
asbestos cement products, including
building sheets, pressure pipes, and
conduits. This use currently accounts
for a b ou t 90 percent of total consump-
tion. The next most important use is
fo the manufacture of synthetic-base
floor and wall tiles. Other uses are in
brake linings, clutch facings, and in
insulating materials. In line with over-
seas trends, the demand for asbestos
in Australia seems likely to continue
to grow, but the rate of growth will be
largely dependent on the building in-
dustry, particularly in the industrial
and commercial spheres.
On the world scene, the tremen-
dous growth in demand since 1950
has resulted in supply shortages.

the look of success

In over a hundred years the Stetson
look of success hasn’t changed a bit.
But the styles certainly have. Every
season Stetson is way out in front with
the right shapes, the right shades to top
the newest suits. And this new ‘Stroller’
is a typical Stetson hat-trick —a versa-
tile, lightweight, plain felt sporting a
handsome plaited band. With the feather
mount it’s a casual—without it, a for-
mal. Just one fine example of over 50
Stetson stylings for Spring/Summer—
at all leading men’s hat stores. Get with
the Stetson look now!
STETSON
Here’s the ‘Centennial’, one
of the more conservative
Stetson plain felts.
In popular patterns, too!
Asbestos has become increasingly -im-
portant in international trade since,
with the exception of Russia, the major
consuming countries have very inade-
auate supplies. World-production has
been steadily increasing and, in view
of new production capacity being in-
stalled in several countries, it seems
that the state of excess demand is
n ow at an end. Nevertheless a healthy
growth rate for most segments of the
industry is being forecast because of
the important new uses for asbestos
which are continually being found.
One such use is as a paper additive to
improve the quality of color print-
ing. This use will have particular ap-
plication in the newspaper industry.
Currently, the two principal Aus-
tralian producers are Australian Blue
Asbestos Pty. Ltd., which mines blue
asbestos at Wittenoom Gorge in the
north-west of Western Australia, and
Asbestos Mines Pty. Ltd., which pro-
duces white asbestos at Baryulgil, 52
miles north-west of Grafton in New
South Wales. A small amount of white
asbestos is also produced at Lionel
and Nunyerry in Western Australiai
Australian Blue Asbestos Pty. Ltd.,
a subsidiary of the Colonial Sugar Re-
fining Company Ltd., achieved record
production of 17,500 tons in 1962. Since
then production rates have declined to
10,600 tons in 1965, mainly because of
labor shortages and extensive roof col-
lapses at the mine and also a sharp
decline in exports due to difficult over-
seas markets for blue asbestos.
ASBESTOS MINES PTY. LTD., a
subsidiary of James Hardie Asbestos
Ltd., is currently the only N.S.W. pro-
ducer of' white asbestos. It operates an
open-cut mine at Baryulgil. In 1964
1030 tons of white asbestos fibre were
produced, being a yield of 3.85 percent
to rock quarried and 7.1 percent to ore
milled. At that stage known reserves
were only sufficient for a further four
years, but intensive exploration by the
company had indicated the existence of
additional reserves.
On current estimations, future pro-
duction from Australian Blue Asbestos
Pty. Ltd. and Asbestos Mines Pty. Ltd.
cannot hope to go anywhere near to
meeting Australia’s growing asbestos re-
quirements. However, a joint explora-
tion venture for white asbestos currently
being undertaken at Woods Reef, near
Barraba, in New South Wales, could
help to. solve the problem of Australia’s
growing import bill. No announcement
has yet been made on the commercial
prospects of the Woods Reef venture.
The two partners are Merit Oil
Limited, of Canada (through its sub-
sidiary Woods Reef Asbestos Company
Ltd.), and Ampol Exploration Ltd.
(through its subsidiary Ampol Mining
Pty. Ltd.). Each partner has a 50 per-
cent interest in the venture.
Exploration commenced early in
1964, and the results of the first stage,
a nnounced in .August, 1965, indicated
an ore potential of at least 18.4 million
tons. Following these encouraging initial
cesults, the partners undertook the
second stage of exploration, involving
extensive magnetometer surveys and
further drilling. This second stage is
now being completed and, although an
announcement of results is not expected
for some weeks,, it is believed that the
ore body could well prove to be very
substantial, justifying large-scale mining
operations.
Such an operation could go a long
way toward meeting Australia’s import
requirements of white asbestos (cur-
rently almost 40,000 short tons a year)
and could possibly provide a future
source of exports to the growing Japan-
ese market. Incidentally, the average
price per short ton of white asbestos
imported into Australia in 1964 was
sllß, but prices for different grades
vary considerably.
An indication of Merit Oil Limited’s
optimism over the future of the ven-
ture was given by its president, the
Hon. R. W. Macaulay, QC, on a visit
to Australia some six months ago. He
stated that company policy would be
to seek more local equity at an approp-
riate time.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
Last week’s tame and rather rudderless sharemarkets saw few
index sections able to resist the drift. Those to firm included Banks
and Other Finance, Building and Pastorals. Non-ferrous Metals
and Oils also fell back, though individual movements were gener-
ally small. King Island Scheelite added 17 cents to touch 2.66,
Mount Morgan 15 cents to 2.62; naturally Western Mining to 1,-
the palm with a 36 cents rise to 5.92. Among industrials BHp
halted an early decline, but on the week lost 12 cents to finish
5.86; turnover was not extraordinary. An excellent result push!!
Thiess up 8 cents to 92 cents. Carrier gained 12 cents to 65 cents

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
Guesswork on Mauri Bros.
UNDER the old investment prin-
ciple that the less they tell you,
the better the company, Mauri
Bros, and Thomson has a very high
rating. Its annual accounts are out-
standing examples of the art of avoid-
ing the spirit, if not the letter, of legis-
lative and stock exchange pressure for
greater disclosure.
Taking the available figures for what
they are worth and by mixing guess-
work and history, it seems a sensible
conclusion that Mauri Bros, may be
a worthwhile investment, despite the
meagre yields available from the pub-
lished earnings and despite the strongly
competitive pressure that appears to be
building up in this industry, largely
from overseas. Perhaps shareholders
will learn more at next week’s annual
meeting. Directors may even tell them
something of the yet-to-be-revealed
plans for the re-location of Victorian
manufacturing activities in a complex
at Altona.
They may be told more of the
accounting implications of its elimin-
ating a lengthy list of subsidiaries and
converting to a divisional basis to avoid
the administrative burden imposed by
the 1961 Companies Act.
JJUT there seems little doubt that the
company’s strength is far greater
than revealed. For instance, the previous
year’s accounts showed profits retained
by subsidiaries were reduced to
$1,976,192 by deducting $1,913,096
excess of book value over par value
(why not assets?) of subsidiary com-
panies which “occurred” during the
year, following several takeovers for
unstated amounts. This was “in accord-
ance with company practice,” although
there was no evidence of similar moves
in 1964 or 1963, nor was there any
apparent in 1966. A revaluation of
shares in subsidiaries was the source
of the one-for-four bonus in October,
1964.
One of the more intriguing items in
the latest accounts is the $1,066,000
footnote for aggregate amount of con-
tracts for capital expenditure, following
on $1,330,000 in 1965. In each of the
two preceding years such contracts only
amounted to $300,000, and it would
probably be true to deduce that Mauri
Bros, is embarked on a program of re-
development on an unprecedented
scale for this company.
, Anyway, this redevelopment program
is being undertaken without recourse to
shareholders or borrowings other than
from the bank. (Indebtedness to the
bank rose from sl.7m. to s2.Bm. in the
last year.) There has in fact been no
call on shareholders for funds since the
one-for-two par issue concurrent with
a one-for-one bonus back in 1952.
(Shareholders have received three gen-
erous issues of free scrip since.)
Properties are unencumbered by any
mortgages, and there are no fixed term
borrowings at all. When forced by the
1961 Companies Act to present con-
solidated accounts for the first time,
the 1962 group results almost doubled
the parent’s 1961 performance. Steadily
increasing profits have been reported
for each of the last 15 years, with no
pause even in 1965 when a change in
balance date from June to May gave
1965 an 11 months trading period.
Judging by the inching up of dividend
rate, shareholders may get another
bonus in two years.
Group tax generally looks slightly
high in relation to reported profits, but
then New Zealand earnings nf nn.
A "vaiauu c<ujuug!>, OX Un-
known significance to the group, are
subject to tax of 10/- in the £NZ. The
associated companies, whose contribu-
tion to group profits is not very great,
are, on the other hand, tax free. These
include Champions Vinegar Co. (Aust.)
Pty., jointly owned with Nestle of the
Bahamas, and the Australasian Pickle
Co., owned in conjunction with Henry
Jones.

SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Neutral Earning Trend
PGH Industries' high dividend yield
THE present PGH Industries
Limited group arose from a
merger in late 1957 between Por-
ter & Galbraith Limited and Hanson
Consolidated Limited. In the following
nine years the merged companies have
moved a long way from the original
activities; nevertheless, the group still
is mainly a manufacturer and supplier
of building materials and its results
t£nd to follow the results of the build-
ing industry. Although the geographical
spread of activties is quite wide (PGH
South-East Asia Ltd. is listed in the
1965 annual report as a “wholly-owned
investment company in Kuala Lum-
pur”), most group locations are in New
South Wales, with sales offices in all
States except Tasmania. The ceramics
division is established in Queensland
and South Australia as well as New
South Wales, the wood products division
in Queensland, while the foundry divi-
sion operates only in Victoria.
Currently the shares of PGH are
selling at $1.12, which is nearly 30 per-
cent below their lowest price for the
past five years, even after adjusting for
the two cash issues and the bonus issue
which have been made during that
period. At $1.12 the dividend yield is
slightly over 7.1 percent and the earn-
ings yield is 9.5 percent on the basis
of 1965-66 earnings. Clearly the market
is taking a very different view of PGH’s
prospects than it has done in the past,
and at first glance it would seem that
the current price looks like an oppor-
tunity to buy into the stock at bargain
prices.
At the time of writing this article,
the annual report of the year to June
30, 1966, is not available, but the profit
for the year has been disclosed in some
detail. This detail does not, however,
show the amount of the minority in-
terests share in the consolidated group
profit, and therefore the total group
profit for the year is not yet available.
Taking the figure for “consolidated net
earnings before depreciation, amortisat-
ion and taxes on income, and after pro-
vision for minority interests” as a
guide, it looks as though profits were
down on 1964-65 by something less than
4 percent. One would have said that
this was not a bad performance in a
year which has been a difficult one
for the building industry, so this can
hardly have been the reason for the
price decline of the ordinary shares.
From the second quarter onward,
profits have been down on the corres-
ponding quarters of the previous year.
An index based on the profits for the
year to June (1959= 100) would appear
as follows:
Quarter ended March June Sept. Dec. March June
1965 1965 1965 1965 1966 1966
Net profit before
tax and depre-
ciation 389 377 396 386 379 375
Earnings 350 381 392 369 350 312
Ordinary capital 371 371 388 388 388 388
The reasons quoted have been as
follows:
Quarter to December 31, 1965:
". . . there was a general easing in the
demand for plywood, and in South
Australia a substantial drop in the sale
uf bricks occurred. Dislocation to pro-
duction at the Melbourne foundry and
the Adelaide pipeworks occasioned by
plant modernisation programs also
contributed to lower earnings.”
Quarter to March 31, 1966: “Profits
for the third quarter have been affected
by a continuing depressed brick market
in South Australia and a substantial
decline in furniture sales.”
Quarter to June 30, 1966: “Group
results for the quarter continued to be
adversely affected by reduced sales of
bricks in South Australia and furni-
ture. The mechanisation of the foundry
in Victoria is now complete, but losses
were incurred during the quarter.”
It appears, however, that, despite all
these problems "and despite the general
problems of the building materials in-
dustry, net profit before tax and
depreciation of the group declined by
only 11 percent during the nine months
as compared with the corresponding
nine months of the previous year.
In the 1965 annual report there was
given a ten-year statistical summary,
and from these figures I have calcu-
lated the following two ratios:
Year to June 30 1956 1957 1958 195 a no ,.
Net profit before tax ”“0

ciation to sales 7.3 9 0 9.9 91 R -
Sales per $ to total 0 3
assets 1.63 1.48 1 42 1.36 j 35
> These figures are rather erratic, but
while the ratio of profit to sales has
not changed greatly, there is some
evidence that the sales to capital ratio
has tended downwards, i.e., more capi-
tal has been needed to sustain sales.
One factor which has become appar-
ent in the last two years is that the
tax provsion has seemed low in relation
to the disclosed net profit before tax.
One would assume that the tax rebates
in respect of export income would not
have been very substantial in such a
group, but it is quite possible that fairly
substantial allowances were obtained
in respect of new plant and equipment.
In view of the statements made by the
company, it would also seem that the
major part of the capital expenditure
has now been incurred and that invest-
ment allowances will probably be much
less during 1966-67. Judging by the
statements concerning the Melbourne
foundry, some tax losses will be avail-
able; whether these will be significant
is difficult to say. If one uses a
“notional” earning rate (net profit
before tax reduced by the percentage
tax rate), PGH’s earnings per share
have been as follows since 1960:
196 0 1 961 19 6 2 19 63 1 964 1 965 1966
Cents per share 10.0 9.0 11.2 10.3 11.0 11.1 8.6
As paid capital in 1966 was more
than 3.6 times capital at the beginning
of 1959-60, this is not a bad record
until the latest year.
If one accepts that this “notional
earning rate” is the best figure to use
in ascertaining price/earnings multip'es,
then even at $1.12 per share PGH’s
shares are selling at 13 times earnings.
This would be quite a high multiple
when the trend in per share earnings
has been neutral over the past seven
years. However, one cannot ignore the
fact that the dividend yield is now in
excess of 7 percent and that over the
same period dividends per’ share have
increased at the average rate of four
percent per annum compound.

BUSINESS BOOK REVIEW
How to Develop the North
By BRUCE DAVIDSON
The Struggle for the North. J. H. Kelly.
Australasian Book Society. $4.25.
THE cattle industry represents the
oldest form of land use in tropi-
cal Australia. Yet one sometimes
suspects that the Australians who are
interested in northern development are
more familiar with the economics of
developing the large mineral deposits
of the region than they are with the
economics of the cattle industry. Any
work which attempts to analyse the
northern cattle industry and to sug-
gest methods of increasing its produc-
tivity will be welcomed by people in-
terested in tropical Australia.
Mr. J. H. Kelly, the author of “The
Struggle for the North,” was employed
by the Department of Primary Industry
as a research economist for a number
of years, and has been closely associ-
ated with many investigations of the
cattle industry in tropical Australia.
With this background, he is able to
comment on both the economic possi-
bility of northern development and the
policies of various governments con-
cerning primary industries in the
north.
The author wisely limits his study to
the area north of the 26th parallel of
latitude, excluding coastal and central
Queensland, where development has
proceeded to a far higher level than
in western Queensland, the Northern
Territory, and the Kimberleys.
The book points out that the future
of the remote regions hinges on the de-
velopment of minerals and cattle. Mr.
Kelly has no hesitation in pointing out
that the population associated with
development will be small, and that
minerals will play the major part in
any development which does take place.
Of a suggested total output of £270
millions from the area, the author sug-
gests that 80 percent will be produced
from mineral workings, 15 percent
from an improved cattle industry, and
a mere 5 percent from irrigation.
JF “The Struggle for the North” did
nothing else, it would have performed
a valuable function in placing the poten-
tial primary industries for northern Aus-
tralia in their correct perspective as far
as their possible contribution to national
development is concerned. Mr. Kelly’s
suggestion that any scheme for northern
development should recognise that nor-
thern Australia has a growing Aboriginal
population, which might play its part
m the development of the region, is
equally welcome. Even if some Austral-
ians are prepared to ignore the exist-
ence of the Aborigines, it is unlikely
that other nations will permit them to
do so for very much- longer.
While attempts to develop northern
Australia, using intensive dryland farm-
lng techniques and large-scale irrigation
schemes have been advocated and criti-
cised by politicians, scientists; and
economists, few people have explored
the possibility of developing the north
by improving the existing cattle in-
dustry. As the cattle industry is the only
large rural industry which has survived
north of the tropic without Government
support, any investigation of the possi-
bility of increasing the productivity of
this industry should be considered seri-
ously. Suggestions which could lead to
an increase in the output of beef in the
north form a major part of “The
Struggle for the North” and it is with
this industry that the author is most
familiar. Mr. Kelly considers that the
chief hindrance to the development of
the cattle industry is the large absentee
pastoral companies which control more
than two-thirds of the grazing land.
He suggests that the output of cattle
from the remote north could be in-
creased by 50 percent if these lands
were resumed, subdivided into smaller
holdings, and sold to resident owner-
operators.
Although details of the amount and
type of improvement which resident
owners would have to undertake to
achieve the desired increase in output
are carefully stated, the reader is left
with the feeling that proof that resident
owners would be more efficient than the
large pastoral companies is lacking.
Some 30 percent of the land is at pre-
sent operated by resident holders, yet
no attempt is made to compare the
productivity of this area with that of
the absentee holders. Instead, Mr. Kelly
contents himself with comparing one
improved station operated by a resident
owner with the vast holdings of the
pastoral companies. Even when this
comparison is made, the reader has to
make his own selections from the data
to discover that the turnoff of catfle
per square mile is fifty percent larger
on the resident holder’s station than on
those of absentee owners in the same
region. One also wonders whether
small resident holders would have the
capital to invest in the additional
fencing and watering points required
or to withstand the long periods of
adverse seasons which occur in these
regions.
Better results might be obtained by
introducing legislation which made a
certain level of improvement obligatory
by any lessee. Although the author
points out that such regulations have
been made in the past and not en-
forced, this does not prove that they
would be impossible to enforce. Mr.
Kelly has made a valuable suggestion
for the development of Australia’s
remote cattle lands, but far more
evidence of its feasibility would be
required before its implementation
could be recommended on a large
scale.
At the same time one cannot ignore
the author’s criticism of the manner in
which both State and Commonwealth
Governments have leased the northern
cattle lands. Was it necessary to renew
the leases on such easy terms for a 50-
year period in the Northern Territory
in 1954, 11 years before the existing
leases expired? Why were leases in
Western Australia, due to expire in
1982, renewed for a 50-year period
in 1963, immediately before the publi-
cation of a Government report on the
condition of pastoral lands in that
State? The charges made by Mr. Kelly
in this respect require answering by
the Governments concerned.
Mr. Kelly also fears that absentee
ownership of the northern mineral
industry will limit its development and
that Australia will only obtain a pittance
in the form of royalties from the
northern mineral industry. He con-
siders that development should be car-
ried out with Australian capital. The
fact that Australia will receive returns
in the form of wages spent and
materials purchased in Australia is
ignored. Similarly, the lack of Aus-
tralian capital for large-scale mineral
development is also overlooked. The
author does not seem to realise that it
might be a case of developing the vast
mineral deposits with foreign capital
or not developing them at all. At the
same time Mr. Kelly’s warning should
not be completely ignored, and every
attempt should be made to obtain
foreign capital with as much Australian
control of development and production
as is possible.
r J , HE role of transport in the develop-
ment of both the cattle and the
mineral industry is carefully studied.
Major railways are considered to be
essential for development, as opposed to
a transport system relying entirely on
roads. Again the reader is disturbed to
find that some evidence favoring road
development rather than rail develop-
ment has been ignored. The failure
to mention Dr. R. G. Patterson’s con-
clusion that a road between Anthony’s
Lagoon and Dajarra would be more
economic than a railway line for the
potential volume of traffic is particu-
larly pertinent in this respect.
In spite of these shortcomings, “The
Struggle for the North” is a valuable
addition to the literature dealing with
northern development. It clearly states
the case against absentee ownership in
tropical Australia and shows the degree
to which development in the remote
north depends on foreign capital. An
alternative to absentee ownership and
foreign capital is suggested for the
cattle industry. Although the evidence
presented suggesting that resident
owners would be more efficient pro-
ducers of cattle than absentee lessees
is not conclusive, research funds might
be better employed in investigating
this suggestion than in attempting to
found intensive farming settlements in
northern Australia.


THE BROKEN HILL PROPRIETARY (0. LTD. AND SUBSIDIARIES
Chairman's Address
EXTRACTS FROM SIR COLIN SYME'S
ADDRESS AT THE ANNUAL GENERAL
MEETING HELD AT SOUTH MELBOURNE
ON FRIDAY, 16th SEPTEMBER, 1966
FINANCIAL
HPHE’year 1966, following the trend of
operations post-war, again showed a
substantial increase in production, to a
new record level of 5.549 million tons of
steel ingots, which represents an increase
of 8.6 percent over last year’s production.
Consolidated net profit, however, did
not follow this upward trend, and for
the first time since 1962 the group ex-
perienced a downturn in profits, falling
from last year’s peak of $39,250 million
to $36,596 million.
This decrease of $2,654 million is
partly explained by the fact that the
1965 figures included more than 12
months’ profit of certain subsidiary com-
panies. This increased the 1965 consoli-
dated profits by $1.2 million. Neverthe-
less, in the light of the substantial pro-
duction increases this year, the fall in
profit is significant and whilst the main
reasons for this have already been stated
in the Directors’ Report, I think they will
bear elaboration.
WHYALLA STEELWORKS
Whyalla Steelworks accounted for
the increase in production, but it did
not make any contribution to net profit.
Its direct operating costs are becoming
quite satisfactory, but the return over
direct costs is not yet sufficient to cover
overhead and depreciation. This, of
course, is due to the relatively low level
of total output. The plant has been, and
is currently, operating well below its
rated capacity for two reasons.
The first of these reasons is the order
position, and the second is that we have
not yet installed all the necessary facili-.
ties to develop the full potential of the
plant. A situation of this sort is inevitable
in the early stages of a new steelworks.
The second phase of development is
now well in hand, and during 1967 an
overall ingot making capacity of 900,000
tons per annum should be reached. Ihe
establishment of the rolling of broad
flange beams in the next month or iwo
will assist in providing a greater load on
steel production.
Assuming a satisfactory order position,
the return from the Whyalla Steelworks
should begin to show a steady improve-
ment in the near future.
FALL IN LOCAL DEMAND
SHAREHOLDERS will recall that an
easing in the then very high level
of local demand had begun to appear at
this time last year and that the decline
had become marked by the time the
Supplementary Report was issued in
February last. The change in the
volume of orders received became
quite dramatic, and whilst order books
are unreliable indicators of consump-
tion, tending to be over-stated in
times of shortage and under-stated in
times of surplus, they do illustrate the
extent to which demand for our pro-
ducts fluctuates. At one stage the ton-
nage of orders received per week from
other than associated companies fell
to 50 percent of the weekly average
over the previous 12 months.
The reduction in demand from
Australian consumers of steel affected
us adversely in several ways. The most
obvious one was that we had to cither
reduce operations or sell the shortfall
overseas. Reduction of operations is
itself very costly, because many
charges do not reduce in line with
falling volume. Therefore, rather than
reduce operations, we on occasions
accepted export prices, down to a point,
where the return did not greatly exceed
direct costs.
I do not want to convey the impression
that all export sales were at unsatisfactory
prices, but in the year under review an
unduly high proportion of them was at
prices which yielded a good deal less than
the margin we would have received on
similar local sales. The low level of export
prices is causing concern in all steel
exporting countries, and is due to the fact
that installed world capacity is in excess
of demand. There is no sign of an early
change in this situation.
There is evidence of a recovery in Aus-
tralian demand, and it is to be hoped
this trend will continue to the point
where we do not need to accept export
sales at unduly low prices.
THE QUESTION OF TAX
CONCESSIONS
is a matter of income tax which
I would like to explain in some de-
tail, because it has had an important
effect on last year’s figures and could
have a more important effect in the
future. Under the Income Tax Act
special concessions are available where a
taxpayer in connection with the carrying
on of mining opera uons has incurred ex-
penditure of a capital nature on necessary
plant, development of the mining pro-
perty or housing and welfare facilities
for mine employees or their dependants.
Furthermore, expenditure of this nature
expected to be incurred on necessary
plant or development of the mining pro-
perty in the year following the year of
income can, for tax purposes, be deducted
from the taxable income of the preceding
year. It has been the Company’s practice
to take advantage of these concessions.
But everything depends on what expendi-
ture can properly be regarded as coming
within the relevant sections.
In the past we have gained consider-
able benefits from these concessions
which are, of course, designed to be an
encouragement to taxpayers engaged in
mining operations and we have made
our calculations of income tax liability on
the basis of rulings previously advised
by the Taxation Department, or on what
we thought were reasonable inferences
from those rulings.
Recently the Commissioner has re-
viewed the Departmental interpretation
and has informed us that much of what
we have regarded and, in fact, been
allowed as being necessary plant and
development in connection with the
carrying on of mining operations will not
now be so regarded and allowed by him.
PELLET PLANT EXAMPLE
JN a matter of this kind there is room
for much difference of opinion as to
when the mining operation starts and
finishes and obviously there will be many
borderline cases. An example of the dif-
ference of view is provided in the case
of the pellet plant being erected at
Whyalla. Much of the iron ore produced
in the Middleback Ranges is in a very
fine powdery condition and cannot be
used without agglomeration by sintering
or pelletising. The pellet plant is located
cn what the Department has previously
accepted, but does not now accept, as
comprising part of the mining property.
This plant seems to us to have a good
deal of similarity with another type of
beneficiating plant located at Iron Knob
for the treatment of scree ore. The Com-
missioner has allowed the deduction in
the case of the scree ore plant but has
now ruled that the pellet plant does not
qualify. In this particular case the long
term result is less serious than the short
term effect because the pellet plant will,
on the Commissioner's present ruling,
qualify for investment allowance and
depreciation. However, there are other
cases where the Department’s view, if it
is upheld, will have serious effects on
both the short and long term positions.
To use the iron ore of north-west
Western Australia will require the con-
struction of a railway and a port, both
very costly enterprises. If this expendi-
ture is not deductible under the Sections
in question, the effect on our cash flow
and on the net cost of such a project
could be quite serious. Much of the ex-
penditure will not qualify for investment
allowance and such other deductions as
may be available will be spread over a
considerable number of years. It seems
to us this situation denies the full benefit
of the taxation concessions relating to
mining projects in those cases where
assistance is most needed, that is where
the mineral deposit is remote from
established areas and requires very ex-
pensive developmental works, to make it
of economic use.
We are, of course, taking steps to chal-
lenge the Commissioner’s interpretation
of the Sections but it is likely to be some
time before final decisions are given and
in the meantime we have thought it pru-
dent to prepare our accounts on the basis
of the Department’s present attitude.
One result of the restricted interpre-
tation imposed by the Commissioner is
that the amount appropriated by the
Group to meet anticipated expenditure
on mining plant and development is
much lower than would otherwise have
been the case; the appropriation this
year was $3.72 million as against $9.3
million last year, and this reduction
directly accounts for a reduction in profit
of $2,371 million.


It also happened that the amount
of investment allowance which could
be claimed for the year under review
was considerably lower than in the
previous year, and this also contributed
to our taxation provision being higher
than otherwise would have been
necessary. The reason for this is that
the investment allowance can bg claimed
only when plant goes into operation, and
much of the year’s expenditure was on
plant which did not come into operation
during the year or was not of a qualify-
ing nature.
DEBENTURE ISSUE
TAESPITE the lower profit for the
year, dividend payout increased
from $19.3 million to $21.5 million.
During the year liquid balances of
the Group declined to $41.6 million, a
drop of $25.1 million, despite the share
issue in the period which raised $32
million. This drop in liquidity was
substantially in accordance with the
forecasts adopted by the Board. Your
Directors decided that an issue of deben-
ture stock should be made, and share-
holders will by now have received full
details of this issue, which is for an
underwritten amount of $3O million, with
the Company having the right to accept
over-subscriptions up to a further $lO
million.
THE OIL AND GAS PROJECT
pETROLEUM exploration has been
continued by Esso Exploration Aus-
tralia Inc. in the Gippsland and Bass
Basins in the tenements held by our
wholly owned subsidiary, Haematite Ex-
plorations Pty. Ltd. Assessments will
shortly be made of the oil and gas
potential of the structure located by the
third exploratory well in the Gippsland
Basin (Marlin Al) and the subsequent
step-out well (Marlin Bl). In this area
weather conditions provide an ever-
present handicap, but Marlin Bl has
encountered unusual difficulties in this
regard. Much more work needs to be
done before the commercial possibilities
of this field can be assessed, but results
to. date furnish good grounds for opti-
mism.
Development of the natural gas field
(Barracouta), in which we have elected
to take a 50 percent working interest,
is still awaiting the outcome of price
negotiations with the Gas and Fuel Cor-
poration of Victoria and the securing of
a satisfactory production title.
These negotiations with the Gas and
Fuel Corporation have been unduly pro-
tracted although some delay is under-
standable in that this is a new type of
venture for this country, both for the
discoverers and the Corporation, and
there are many attendant risks and un-
certainties. Discussions are continuing in
an atmosphere of mutual understanding
and we are hopeful that finality will
soon be reached. In the meantime, I
feel that shareholders should be advised
of our position. Esso Exploration and
w e have jointly offered to supply gas
under a long-term agreement to the
Corporation at a price which, after
adding estimated transmission charges,
w °uld make the price into mains on
the outskirts of Melbourne about a
quarter of Corporation’s present
manufacturing cost into terminal storage
a t Melbourne. We recognise that the
Cas and Fuel Corporation will be in-
volved in heavy expense in further reticu-
lation facilities, in conversion of exist-
ing equipment to the new type of fuel
and for other reasons, but nevertheless,
it is calculated that at our proposed price,
the Corporation would be able to reduce
existing average consumers tariffs by 25
percent immediately and by 50 percent
within five years. Further reductions
appear possible after that.
RISKS AND REWARDS
"YyE are firmly of the view that unless
adequate rewards for the great risks
and expense involved in petroleum ex-
ploration are possible—they can by no
means be assured—the search for oil
in this country will receive a major
setback particularly so far as the Aus-
tralian investor is concerned. It is worth
mentioning that the hire and operation
of an offshore drilling rig such as Glomar
111 costs approximately $lO million per
annum.
Reference has been made in the
Directors’ Report to the Agreement made
with Esso Exploration Australia Inc. to
cover exploration of the Bass Strait areas
known as Otway Basin. We are pleased
to have this further association with Esso
Exploration whose offer was considered
the most attractive among a number of
strongly competitive offers. A drilling rig
of the semi-submersible type is now under
construction at the Company’s Whyalla
Shipyard for Ocean Drilling and Ex-
ploration Co. (Aust.) Ltd. and when
completed will be engaged in carrying
out a drilling programme as agreed. This
is expected to commence not later than
September next year and every effort
will be made to commence earlier.
A feature of Esso’s offer for the Otway
Basin is that it gives our Company cer-
tain options to obtain finance from Esso
on reasonable terms towards capital ex-
penditure that we may incur in the
development of a discovery in the Otway
Basin and in the Marlin field.
The provision of this finance will not
affect in any way the management of
the project or the interest of your Com-
pany in it. The Company is in the
position of being able to decide for itself
whether to take a 12£ percent royalty
interest or a 50 percent working interest
in any new field which is discovered.
If it decides to take a royalty interest it
will not be required to provide any of
the capital or operating expenditures.
If, however, it elects to take a 50 percent
working interest, which in fact it has
already done in the case of Barracouta,
it will be an equal partner with Esso
in the venture, providing one half of all
expenditures and (subject to certain
over-riding royalties) being entitled to
one half of all production.
Where the Company elects to take a
50 percent working interest, the project
will be operated by Esso under the direc-
tion of an Operating Committee on
which we have equal representation.
Shareholders will understand from
what I have said that the financing of
the continuing exploration programme is

IRON ORE DEVELOPMENT
HDHE future of development of iron ore
resources in Western Australia has
been the subject of much study by your
Company and others during the year
under review. In 1964 the Company
entered into an Agreement with the
Western Australian Government under
which the Company, among other things,
agreed that it would develop the Deep-
dale deposits of limonitic iron ore over
which it holds temporary reserves. The
arrangement was that, unless the project
were shown by the end of 1966 to be
technically or economically unjustified,
we would proceed with the develop-
ments so that deliveries of ore could
commence not later than 1975. Sub-
sequently, an agreement was made with
Cliffs Western Australia Mining Co. Ltd.
for sharing facilities which could serve
their Robe River deposits as well as our
Deepdale area, such as the railway and
the port the agreement being intended
to make these respective developments
more financially attractive to both
parties. However, this latter Agreement:
was subject to a clause which permitted
Cliffs Western Australia Mining Co. Ltd.
to give notice of termination if it was
unable to make arrangements satisfactory
to its parent corporation, The Cleveland
Cliffs Iron Company, for the financing
of their part, of the project. This notice
of termination was given by Cliffs
Western Australia. About this time the
participants in the Mt. Newman iron
ore project, i.e. American Metal Climax
Inc. and Colonial Sugar Refining Co.
Ltd., were encountering problems with
their plan for developing the extensive
hematite deposits at Mt. Newman and
at their invitation both Cleveland Cliffs
and your Company joined them in dis-
cussions as to how this project might
be made viable.
These discussions covered various
alternative developments, including the
manufacture and sale of pellets from Mt.
Newman ore. It was common to all these
proposals that our Company would par-
ticipate equally with each of the other
parties in the provision of capital for
the facilities required to produce and
ship iron ore but without participation
in any of the sales contracts and without
necessary involvement in the pellet plant
proposals. Recently Cleveland Cliffs de-
cided to withdraw from the negotiations
and at the present time we are con-
tinuing discussions with the other parties,
the State Government and the Japanese
purchasers to see if a satisfactory pro-
posal can be formulated under which
our Company would participate with
the other parties in the sales contracts
and in addition would be a substantial
user of Mt. Newman ore. The project
as contemplated is a very large one.
indeed, and will call for heavy capital
investment. The State Government has
indicated its satisfaction that the Com-
pany may take this interest in the Mt.
Newman venture on the lines proposed
and in the event that it our
obligations in respect of the Deepdale
areas, will be deferred. With so many
parties involved, the negotiations are
necessarily very complex, but it is hoped
that a satisfactory conclusion will be
reached.
As part of our continuing drive for
greater efficiency, we have from time
to time engaged consultants to advise on
particular aspects of our industry. We
have recently engaged a leading firm of
overseas management consultants on a
more generalised assignment in the. hope
that, with their assistance, we will be
able to improve our organisation and
procedures.

MAN ON THE LAND
A Bad Act for Eggs
SENATOR R. J. DAVID TURN-
BULL, of Tasmania, is a courage-
ous man. He has written letters
to various papers calling attention to the
urgent need for a Federal ombudsman.
The proposed amendments to the
Poultry Industry Levy Collection Act,
he says, is a striking evidence of the
need for an ombudsman.
Personally, we are not sure that an
ombudsman is the answer. In the Aus-
tralian tradition, we feel that an
ombudsman would rapidly become a
great department of ombudsmi.
Apart from this, everything Senator
Turnbull says is important, even if the
reason for it, eggs, is perhaps relatively
unimportant. In his letter he says:
“The Government proposes to force
through Parliament, with the aid of
its unthinking members, a most out-
rageous bill. I refer to the Poultry
Industry Levy Collection Act, in which
departmental officers, without even a
warrant, may enter and search at will
any egg producer’s home, even in his
absence. If this bill is allowed to pass
in Parliament, whose turn will it be
next?”
Of course, the Senator is right, and,
of course, the bill is outrageous. The
CEMA plan, allegedly for the stabilisa-
tion of the egg industry, and the im-
mediate cause of this proposed amend-
ment, is possibly the worst act by a
Federal Government, in principle, since
Federation. We said so at the time it
was created, and nothing has hap-
pened to cause us to change our mind.
In practice there might be some-
thing to be said for it. The egg industry
is not the wool industry, or beef, or
wheat. It is not big enough to make
much difference, either way, to the
Gross National Product.
It is possible that, by the time this
is published, the Minister for Primary
Industry, Mr. Adermann, may have
been prevailed upon to consider prin-
ciple and to adjust the proposed amend-
ment accordingly, if that is possible.
A group of free-trader egg producers
aware of both principle and what the
bill may do to their pockets, have
mounted a campaign against the
amendment. Whether there is an ad-
justment or not, the fact remains that
the very conception of this amendment
is against everything democracy stands
for.
It is worse, really, than Senator Turn-
bull says. The proposal to permit in-
spectors to enter any farm, any time
they like, is bad enough. But there is
a second string to the amendment which
would permit diversion of CEMA levy
funds to research. Again, research is
a good thing and most people, includ-
ing us, would say that it is. The point
at issue, however, is not the value of
research.
The point at issue is that the CEMA
plan was clearly defined as a stabilis-
ation measure when it was bulldozed
through Parliament. Now, less than 12
months from its inception, it is to be
changed to something else. From mem-
ory, only three speakers in Federal
Parliament treated the CEMA plan
seriously. One was Jeff Bate from the
N.S.W. South Coast. He made a good
speech, drawing attention to the prin-
ciple involved, but half the House was
empty and most of those present ap-
peared to relish the opportunity for
schoolboy interjections of the “foul
play” variety.
Sticking with principle, which is
what this article is about rather than
the egg industry itself, it must be stated
that the CEMA plan was foisted on the
egg industry. There was no referendum
of producers and no opportunity for
referendum.
A FEW weeks ago the Victorian
Wheat and Woolgrowers’ Associa-
tion, which is not interested in any way
in eggs, asked for, and got, replies from
Mr. Holt, Mr. McEwen, Mr. Calwell,
Sir Henry Bolte, and others on their
attitude toward a stabilisation plan for
wool. We do not intend going into
these in detail here. That is another
story. But both the Prime Minister,
Mr. Holt, and the Leader of the
Country Party, Mr. McEwen, in
approximately the same terms, stressed
that their parties favored stabilisation
plans for primary produce provided
any plan was the expressed will of the
majority of producers. How then,
can either possibly justify the CEMA
plan itself or the proposed amendment?
Certainly not by any measure of pnn-
ciple.
The practical side?
Here we have an alarming situation.

supposedly to be protected by the
CEMA plan is, in fact, going out of
existence. The feed merchant, in the
traditional sense, is likewise disappear-
ing. What we have now is rapidly grow-
ing factory farms and giant feed pro-
cessors.
The State Egg Boards have almost
dictatorial control over the marketing
of eggs and if the search-without-war-
rant Bill goes through they will achieve
a mastery unsurpassed in even
Communist-dominated countries such
as Yugoslavia and Poland. This is no
exaggeration. A study of farm produce
marketing methods in Yugoslavia, par-
ticularly, reveals far more freedom of
action than is usually associated with
a Communist regime. Even in Britain,
which is finally paying the price for
extravagant welfarism in farming, the
farmer is permitted to make free “farm
gate” sales of eggs.
TTNDER the proposed change,
$lOO,OOO from CEMA levies will go
to research. This will be matched by the
Federal Government with taxpayers’
money. There is no provision for
cheaper eggs for taxpaying consumers.
The carefully contrived inference is
that the research will benefit the “small
farmer,” help keep him in business. If
this were the case, there might be some-
thing to be said for it. But, in fact, this
can hardly happen. The beneficiaries
of research will be, in the main, the
factory farms which are well able to
pay for research themselves. Absolved
from this responsibility by a benevolent,
allegedly free-enterprise Government,
they will be able to devote more funds
to talking over family-unit farmers.
The feed processors will do well out
of it. They have done well out of
CEMA already. Prices for feed, and,
therefore, the cost of producing eggs,
have risen since the plan came in.
Some strange things can be discerned
in the egg industry. While the Egg
Boards have assumed dictatorial powers,
there are, nevertheless, a number of
large, and profitable, privately owned
egg-packing plants which operate under
Egg Board licence on a contract system.
At the very same time a number of
producers and retailers claim they have
been victimised by the Egg Board.
There is the pending challenge of
CEMA in the Privy Council by one
such retailer, backed by producers who
believe he has right on his side.
The danger in all this for the
Liberal and Country' Parties should be
obvious, but apparently isn’t. The alli-
ance between Government and big
operators, to the detriment of small
producers, is likely to lead to demands
for complete socialisation of the in-
dustry. Failing this, it is an open
invitation to anarchy. Men will be
pushed so far. If the bill does go
through and if the inspectors (where
they will be recruited and what type
°f person they will be is quite relevant)
Warch into farms, then someone is
likely to get hurt.


New wine variety
from Australia
wins Gold Medal
at International
Wine Fair
McWilliams
Private Bin 56
Lexia has been
awarded a Gold
Medal at the
1966 Inter-
national Wine
Fair held at
Ljubljana,
Y ugoslavia.
RWIUIMn
McWilliam’s Lexia, recently intro-
duced to the Australian market, is a
distinctive, dry white table wine
which could not be exhibited in any
Australian Wine show, because there
was no classification for this new
variety.
McWilliam’s, therefore, entered it
overseas, and are justifiably proud of
receiving a top Gold Medal award.
In the short time it has been available,
this wine has received considerable
acclaim. McWilliam’s Lexia is made
from the grape variety know as Lexia,
and was produced at McWilliam’s
Robinvale Winery in Victoria.
During fermentation the temperature
was maintained below 55° F., and
this has helped to retain in the wine
a very powerful aroma of the grape,
as well as a tremendous volume of
flavour. This light, dry white table
wine is an ideal accompaniment to
most foods, particularly seasoned fish
dishes, white meats and poultry.
Other successes at Ljubljana for
McWilliam’s included Gold Medals
for Cream Sherry; Private Bin 530
Claret; Mount Pleasant Sauterne; Dry
Friar Sherry; Sherry (fruity type);
Muscat; Mount Pleasant Hermitage;
Champagne and Brandy.

AGRISEARCH
Neglect in Rural Education
IF downright villainy brings the worst
social evils, then neglect of educa-
tion would be next most destructive
to modern communities. In an agricul-
tural country such as ours, agricultural
education should logically be given top
priority after law and order has been
established. Yet, from top to bottom,
agricultural education appears to be
in parlous circumstances. And when
the needs of the future are taken into
the reckoning, the present predicament
can only be called appalling.
From the very few secondary schools
in which agricultural science is still
taught as a subject, the educational
purists would have it extirpated. Dent-
istry, medicine, pharmacy, engineering,
etc., they hold, are rightly not offered
as subjects at this level and agriculture
should not be either. The technical
schools present a very limited and dis-
jointed course, which usually only
covers a few special aspects such as
woolclassing or farm mechanics. The
agricultural colleges are no longer inter-
ested in training the sons of farmers
to become farmers, as was their original
intention. And even if this was still their
first aim, their paucity and impoverish-
ment would only enable a small per-
centage of the would-be farmers to
enrol for training. The university facul-
ties apparently do not turn out enough
suitably trained people for research.
The CSIRO has to obtain over 70
percent of its staff from overseas. The
Departments of Agriculture and other
State departments concerned with soil
conservation, water supply, and so on,
say they would employ more research-
trained scientists if they could get them.
Industry and commerce say the same.
University training for extension work
is virtually non-existent.
This gloomy picture emerges from a
recent book entitled “Agricultural Edu-
cation in Australia,” by Dr. R. N. Far-
quhar. It is published for the Australian
Council of Educational Research, Fred-
erick St., Hawthorn, Victoria (price
$6), under whose auspices Dr. Far-
quhar, of CSIRO, conducted a detailed
study of the whole gamut of agricul-
tural education and training in Aus-
tralia.
He counted noses, as it were, in
schools, colleges, and universities. He
probed into the syllabuses offered and
the competence of the teachers.
He considered how well the various
courses available fitted people for the
jobs they were doing or would have
to do. He traced the progress that
has taken place in agriculture and from
this projected the sort of agriculture
that will be practised 20 or 30 years
hence, when the youngsters now in
school will be taking over the manag-
erial and leadership positions. He
sketched the sort of skills, know-
ledge, general ability, and help that
people need to be successful in agri-
culture right now, and the additional
attainments that the rising generation
will need if it is to maintain economic
viability with respect to the rest of
the community.
As a result he was impelled to make
no less than 33 basic recommendations.
These call for the expansion of existing
facilities, the modification of the exist-
ing systems, and the provision of new
kinds of training. In sum, his recom-
mendations aim to give everyone in
agriculture adequate and appropriate
training for his job. In particular, they
attempt to mend two large holes in
the educational fence. These are the
near total lack of training opportunity
that the present system offers for people
planning to become farmers or farm
workers, and agricultural extension
workers.
Dr. Farquhar shows that the number
of farms in Australia is likely to remain
at about a quarter of a million. This
means that about 8000 new owners or
operators take over, usually from then-
fathers, each year. Therefore, he has
recommended that facilities for agri-
cultural education and training for
farming be progressively developed on
the basis of planning to meet eventually
the needs of this number.
AGRICULTURAL extension, as
defined by Dr. Farquhar, “is a
service or system which assists the rural
people, through educational procedures,
in improving farming methods and
techniques, increasing production effici-
ency and incomes, bettering their levels
of living, and lifting the social and
educational standards of rural life.” Ur.
Farquhar, incidentally, is probably Aus-
tralia’s only authority on extension edu-
cation. In the past, so-called agricultural
extension has at best only reached the
level of a technical advisory service.
To achieve the goals set out in his
definition, extension workers in future
will need very special training. For
this he recommends the urgent develop-
ment of an institute of agricultural
extension in one of the universities
and the appointment of a lecturer in
extension to every university faculty of
agriculture. Moreover, as there is no
substitute for quality in extension
workers, careers in extension must be
made at least equally attractive to
careers in research or administration
if the best brains are to go into it.
Accordingly, it is recommended that
“State Government agricultural ser-
vices ensure equal professional recog-
nition, reward, and total career pos-
sibilities to graduates in extension and
in research.” Even while the presses
were rolling out this considered advice,
some State departments of agriculture
were signing salary agreements that
widened the gulf separating extension
and research. Woe to the farmer and
the taxpayer!

If you turn back from the “Jobs
Vacant” page to the financial page
you’ll find there is still little heartening
news. There continue to be plenty of
very reasonable reports, but they make
very little impact on the sluggish state
of the market.
Mining is still the only bright spot.
In particular, beach sands companies
have been strong, with both Western
Titanium and Westralian moving
steadily ahead. While there is probably
justification in the higher prices, there’s
also a profit, and that’s one thing that
is difficult to find in the market these
days. Thus the sale of Western Titan-
ium. Perhaps I should be using these
funds to buy King Island Scheelite.
The price of tungsten is now moving
up again; so also is the price of KIS
shares. With one of the major producer
countries, China, still showing little
inclination to sell to the Western
countries, a genuine deficit in the supply-
demand position is developing. How-
ever, the King Island advocates should
not overlook the policy of the U.S.
Government, whose intention is to place
an effective ceiling on the price of
tungsten not much above the present
tungsten price level. This they will do
through releases from a very substantial
stockpile.
Instead of buying a share that is
currently popular, I’ll settle on a right
that has steadily weakened. Starting off
at 55c Associated Security rights have
drifted down to 38c. Such behaviour
seems more a reflection of the general
state of the market rather than any
shortcoming in the company itself.
to what I’d always
thought, finance companies are
among the best growth companies in
the last decade. Consequently they offer
not only high income return but a con-
stant stream of bonus and cash issues.
Associated Securities has all these
characteristics. Since 1959, share-
holders have received four bonus issues
and three cash issues. Even though
there has been this enormous increase
in capital, dividend rate was raised
from 15 to 16 percent in 1961, and
since then has been maintained at this
level. Based on the present price of
the rights, the new shares will show a
yield of just on 5.7 percent. With only
a week to go before rights trading
closes, my order went in for 500
The second purchase of the week
being Whale Industries, low-priced
securities seem to be the order of the
day. These shares came into the port-
folio at 43 cents.
Whale Industries must be one of the
few companies that has managed to
extricate itself from a dying industry
and continue as a going concern in a
quite unrelated activity. Recognising
the increasing limitations of the whal-
ing industry, a pastoral property near
Moree was acquired in 1959. When
Whale Industries finally withdrew from
the whaling industry in 1962, this pro-
perty became the major interest of the
company.
By 1964 the company had completed
its reorganisation and sufficient profits
were earned to resume dividends at the
rate of five percent. Given reasonable
climatic conditions, profits should have
steadily increased from this point. But
the drought intervened to cause a loss
of $142,000 in 1965-66. Since June,
conditions have radically improved.
Transactions for the week were:
SOLD
400 Western Titanium ctg. 1.50 SSBB
BOUGHT
500 Whale Industries .43 $220
400 Associated Securities
Rts. .39 $l6O
After these transactions the credit
balance in the account stands at $551.

RHAZES AND ARABIC MEDICINE—one of a series of oil
paintings. © 1958-60 — Parke , Davis & Company
Great Moments in Medicine
The Western World is indebted to the Arabic
World for preserving medical knowledge dur-
ing Europe’s strife-torn Middle Ages. Rhazes,
born in Persia in 865 A.D., was a leader in
Arabic medicine. He was the first to describe
measles and smallpox, to observe the reaction
of the eye’s pupil to light, and to publish a text
on children’s diseases.
It took many years for Arabic science to reach
Europe by way of North Africa and Spain.
Today, the newest findings of medical researches
are speeded to the world’s physicians in mere
minutes. Many lives have been saved by this
rapid intercommunication of scientific knowledge.
Research scientists at Parke-Davis laboratories
around the world have repeatedly contributed
to the advances of medical science; and they are
among the first to learn of scientific advances
reported by others. Parke-Davis translates research
discoveries into practical methods of manufac-
turing, and makes latest medical developments
available in easily prescribed forms for the con-
venience of patients, physicians, and pharmacists
in almost every community in the world.

'single 7 whiskies
when you pour one glass of
Johnnie Walker
BY APPOINTMENT TO
HER MAJESTY THE QUEEN
SCOTCH WHISKY DISTILLERS
JOHN WALKER & SONS, LTD.
When you pour yourself a Johnnie
Walker you have more than 40
‘single’ whiskies all in one glass
because it does take that many fine
whiskies to make one Johnnie
Walker. That’s the secret of
Johnnie Walker’s smoothness and
mellowness. And 146 years’ skill in
blending. These different whiskies
come from all over Scotland. Rich,
characterful Glenlivets and
Highland malt whiskies tangy
with the faint taste of smoke from
peat fires. Smooth, rounded Islays.
And clean, fresh-tasting grain
whiskies from the Lowlands. Some
of these whiskies are matured as
long as fifteen years none less
than five. All very smooth. Very
me.llow. No wonder Johnnie Walker
is the world’s best-loved Scotch. In
miniatures, 5 oz. and 13 oz. flasks,
13 oz., and, 26 oz. square bottles.
