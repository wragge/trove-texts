Some practical reasons why Hudson’s
Eumenthol Tooth Powder should be
used for the Preservation of the Teeth.
BECAUSE it Contains the Germicidal and
Antiseptic virtues that have made Eumen-
thol Jujubes famous the world over.
BECAUSE, it is not only an Antiseptic and
Germicide, but cleanses mechanically,
owing to the evolution of oxygen when in
contact, with water or mo'sture.
BECAUSE it is the oxygen which whitens the
Teeth so wonderfully, and wards off decay
as no other preparation for the Teeth
can or will do.

The Red Page
The Fiction Harvest
“And they lived happily ever afterwards.”
Did they? This query comes instinctively
at the end of every novel; for the novel, if
it is a work of art, ends with a solution of
the problem stated by the author. But
that solution is but a partial one, unless it
ends in the death of the hero or the
heroine; and even then there is no
solution of the life-problems of the survivors.
Hamlet is the classic exception: there is
practically nobody of importance left at the
end of the last the" Elsinore
undertaker. You know everything that has
happened and everything that will happen—
chiefly funerals—to all the leading charac-
ters. And. in the realm of the novel, Arnold
Bennett’s Old Wives' Tale practically cleans
the slate. Jennie Gerhard ', by Theodore
Dreiser (Harper, per Lockley Library)', also
leaves no loose ends.
This work, like the author’s Sister Carrie,
is realism carried consistently out to the last
page. The story, is that of a fine woman,
the daughter of poverty-stricken parents, for
whose fineness the modern American world
has no honest use. The girl is seduced by
a Senator who means to marry her but unex-
pectedly dies. Left with her baby, the girl
is thrown into the hands of a rich manufac-
turer, a fine fellow who appreciates her, but
puts off marrying her till pressure from his
family and the threatened disinheriting of
him by his father compels him to renounce
her. All through we are made to feel the force
of the impact of Circumstance upon this
woman’s soul. Had the Senator not so un-
expectedly died, she would have been a re-
spectable married woman. As it was :
Certain processes of the" all-mother,
the great artificing wisdom of the power that
works and weaves in silence and in dark-
ness, when viewed by the light of the estab-
lished opinion of some of the little indivi-
duals created by it, are considered very vile.
We turn our faces away from the creation
of life as if that were the last thing that
man should dare to interest himself in,
openly. It is curious that a feeling of this
sort should spring up in a world whose very
essence is generative, the vast process dual,
and where wind, water, soil and light alike
minister to the fruition of that which is all
that we are. Although the whole world, not
we alone, is moved by passions hymeneal,
and everything terrestrial has come into
being by the one common road, yet there is
that ridiculous tendency to close the eyes
and turn away the head as if there were
something unclean in nature itself. “Con-
ceived in iniquity and born in sin,” is the
unnatural interpretation put upon the pro-
cess by the extreme religionist, and the
world, by its silence, gives assent to a judg-
ment so marvellously warped.
For Jennie was not built to stand aloof
from life.
It is a curious characteristic of the non-
defensive. disposition that it is like a honey-
jar to flies. Nothing is brought to it, and
much is taken away. Around a soft, yield-
ing, unselfish disposition, men swarm natur-
ally. They sense* this generosity, this non-
protective attitude from afar. A girl like
Jennie is like a comfortable fire to the aver-
age masculine mind; they gravitate to it,
seek its sympathy, yearn to possess it.
Hence she was annoyed by many unwelcome
attentions.
There are no raptures in this story deal-
ing with a subject that is so popular with
the average novel reader. The delights of
this clandestine, attachment are not revealed ;
and at the end it grows as dull as the aver-
age happy marriage. Dreiser writes pedes-
trian prose, he inserts the least significant
details; he rambles on. His book, with its
unexpected accidents, its dull continuity, its
griefs and worries salved by the passage of
time, is rather like Life itself. And ever
the author wonders whether it matters very
much what decisions one takes in one’s ex-
istence. If the lover of Jennie had married
her, not cast her off —well provided for, of
couise —Dreiser intimates that it wouldn’t
have made much difference in his character,
“and Jennie in the end would not have been
much better off than she was now.” Nothing
matters —even in a novel.
So it ends with the hero, an old man,
eating too heavily and drinking too much
and dying—with Jennie to nurse him a; the
end. Both old people, the romance dead.
And Jennie’s child had died, too, and she, in
her solitude, had adopted two orphans from
a home... .and that’s all.
Yet Jennie Gerliardt is one of the few
good novels that have come from the United
States, no better, no worse, than Sister
Carrie. The characters are real, human.
You feel you have known them for years.
Dreiser’s art is strikingly akin to that of
Arnold Bennett.
J*
Claude Farrcre, author of The Battle
(Mills and Boon, per Lockley Library), evi-
dently knows his Japan. The Battle is the
Tsu-shima smash up, and the description of
a modern naval engagement, even when one
fleet is composed of lame ducks, is brilliantly
done. The working of the turret of one of
the anthropoid battleships is described with
a technical thoroughness that suggests that
the author has been there. The book, how-
ever, gets nowhere. A Japanese officer al-
lows an English naval attache to make love
to his wife, with the deliberate purpose of
getting certain British naval secrets from
him. He gets them. There is also an
Italian nobleman in love with the lady. But
the death of her husband sends her to neither
of her lovers, but to a Buddhist convent.
The chaos working in the nation by the
effort of the Japanese brain to become a
Western brain is admirably suggested. The
book is said to have had a circulation of
500,000 copies in France. It is difficult to
say why.
£
The novel in yearly parts is becoming a
habit. Romain Holland writes the history
of Jean Cliristophe in some half-dozen novels,
Arnold Bennett will tell us all about Clay-
hanger and Hilda Lessways in half that
space, and now James Stephens begins what
promises to be an interminable Charwoman’s
Daughter. The first instalment of The
Charwoman's Daughter (Macmillan) takes
us only through the girl’s youth and one and
a half love affairs; and it cheekily ends with
this annoqhcement: “Thus far the story of
Mary Makebelieve.” Mary is subtly and
sympathetically drawn; and her first love
affair is possibly the first romance in which
a policeman figures in literature. When
Mary sits in the park with her policeman:
The. astounding thought that she was sit-
ting beside a man warmed and affrighted
her blood so that it rushed burningly to her
cheeks, and went shuddering back again
coldly. Her downcast eyes were almost mes-
merised by the huge tweed-clad knees, which
towered like monoliths beside her. They
rose much higher than her knees did, and
extended far out more than a foot and a
half beyond her own modest stretch. Her
knees slanted gently downwards as she sat,
but his jagged straitly forward, like the
immovable knees of a god which she had
seen once in the Museum. On one of these
great knees an equally great hand rested
The specific gravity of that hand seemed tre-
mendous; she could itnagine it holding down
the strong neck of a bull.
So much for the policeman’s limbs, James
Stephens is an admirable realist. The book,
in which nothing occurs, evidences a keen
observation of life and a vivid conception
of character. Mrs. Makebelieve, who gets
eighteenpence or 'so for a day’s incredibly
hard work in Free Trade Ireland, is a de-
lightful character. Here is how she dresses
herself when- charing calls
In an instant Mrs. Makebelieve bounded
from her bed; three wide twists put up lier
hair; eight strange billow-like movements
put on her clothes; as each article,of cloth-
ing reached a definite point on her person
Mary stabbed it swiftly with ‘ a pin—four
ordinary pins in this place, two safety-pins
in that; then Mrs. Makebelieve kisSed her
daughter 16 times, and fled down the stairs
and away to her work. *
And Stephens elucidates'certain obscure
points in the psychology of women. One
morning when the charwoman felt disin-
clined to char: — -
She said it gave her all the trouble in the
world to lift a bucket. It was not exactly
that she could not lift a bucket, but that she
could scarcely close her mind-down to the fact
that a bucket had to be lifted. To close her
two hands on a floor-cloth and twist it into
a spiral in order to wring ,it thoroughly
was a thing which she found herself imagining
she could do if she liked,, but had not the
least wish to do The bucket into which
her hand had been plunged a moment before
seemed somehow' incredibly distant. To lift
the soap lying beside the bucket would re-
quire an arm of more than human reach,
and, having washed, or rather dabbed, at a
square of flooring, it was a matter of grave
concern how to reach the unwashed part
just beyond without moving herself.
As for husbands :
She was, as every woman is in the morn-
ing, primed with conversation about hus-
bands ; for in the morning husbands are
unwieldy, morose creatures without joy,
without lightness, lacking even the common,
elemental interest in their own children, and
capable of detestably misinterpreting the
conversation of their wives. It is only
by mixing amongst other men that this
malignant humor may he dispelled. To
then, the company of men is like a great
bath, into which a husband will plunge
wildly, renouncing as he dives wife and chil-
dren, all anchors and securities of hearth and
roof, and from which he again emerges sin-
gularly refreshed and capable of being inter-
ested by a wife, a family and a home until
the next morning.
And as for women :
They are always on their best behavior
towards one another. Indeed, it often seems
as if they feared and must by all possible
means placate each other by flattery, humor,
'or a serious tactfulness. There is very
little freedom between them, because there
is no real freedom or acquaintance, but
between things polar. There is nothing but
a superficial resemblance between like
and like, but between like and unlike
there is space wherein both curiosity and
spirit may go adventuring... .Between the
sexes there is a really extraordinary freedom
of intercourse. _ A man and a woman may
become quite intimate in a quarter of an
hour. Almost certainly they will endeavor
to explain themselves to each other before
many minutes have elapsed ; but a man and
a man will not do this, and even less so
will a woman and a woman, for these are
parallel lines which never meet. The ac-
quaintanceship of the latter, in particular,
often begins and ends in an armed and
calculating neutrality.
The facile descent of J. C. Snaith on the
primrose path to popularity must be sorrow-
fully chronicled. The author of Broke of
Govenden, Henry Northcote, and William
Jordan, Junior, hovered a moment with
Araminta, deliberately descended to Fortune,
and slid easily into the Zenda romance of
Mrs. Fite. The Principal Girl (Methuen,
per Lockley Library) lapses to the perilous
popularity of the latest output of William
J. Locke, with all the machinery creaking
and an escape of steam in the form of an
irritating affectation of manner that would
damn a lesser writer 1 . There is humor in
this modern story of a lordling who weds an
actress; there is romance and tenuous char-
acter drawing of the stock', types of fie.ion.
And it is readable, fluffy, clever and slight.
But the time has come, one thinks, for a
farewell to a writer who might have been
great—indeed, was great—but who prefers
to be serialised in popular magazines. Of
course, there is more money in the innocuous
serial —and, for all we know, Snaith might
have found there is no cash in masterpieces.

tart, woman, female; to the members gen-
erally of the Sex which mostly buttons its
Clothes at the back. How is it, I desire to
know, that not only has Australian. fiction
not produced a Heroine worthy of the name,
but even Australian Poetry has ignored the
existence of the Australian Girl? Our
Poets, I am aware, have spilt much ink over
Girl, but ndt Australian Girl, The Girl
they scribble about belongs not to this
country, but to any old Bohemia in any
old part of the world. Many of our Poets
give the impression that their experience of
Her. has been confined to the Buxom Wench
who fills them a tankard with foaming Beer
when they have 3d., and tells them not to
maul the Counter Lunch about when they
haven’t.
O.iir Poets appear to have met but one
Girl, cincl She mostly has Vine Leaves in her
hair and Nicotine Stains on her fingers.
Grant Heryey explains At Length how he
contrived to Kiss her in a hansom cab, and
Frank Morton tells of how he helped her
fry Sausages over the studio gas stove. At
some time or other we have all taken her
to Mentone or some such place, per taxi, on
a Sunday afternoon and allowed Her to feed
us on lumps of Loaf Sugar soaked in Her
coffee.,,, Afterwards She has lit Her Cigar-
ette from ours and told us that she Hated
the Awful Life, She is mostly a fine, full-
bosomed Girl, with good lied Blood in Her
veins, and a contempt for the Seven Deadly
Dull Virtues in Her heart, but She is not
Essentially Australian. I am Positive that
there is an Australian Girl, and that She is
Different to any other Girl. I think the
Time Is Ripe for our Poets to notice Her
existence. Further, I am of opinion, O
Red Rajah, that were adequate Financial
Incentive offered, our prize Poets and Tripe-
mopgers would hasten to seek Her out and
learn as much as they could concerning Her.
I feel Certain they would send You a large
number of Damn Bed poems, and. perhaps—
who knows—ONE that really does Her long-
delayed Justice.
What are You going to Do about the
matter, anyhow?
Harrison Owen.
Frankly, there seems no escape for us.
Though this page honestly believed that .She
had been adequately treated as heroine of the
10 best Australian novels, and inspiration of
the thousand worst Australian poems, we
are willing to give her fervid admirers an-
other chance. After all, we cannot have too
much Australian girl. The only stipula-
tions We make is that Harrison Owen starts
from scratch, that no poem, drivel, doggerel
or snort has been published before, apd that
the She of the poem shall be as tyoical of
this Commonwealth or of the Dominion as
the kangaroo, the weka, the Wows o ” or any
other natural output or primary industry of
these regions. Though any poet who is ac-
quainted with her needs no further reward
on this earth, a guinea will be paid for the
best poem devoted to the Essentinllv Aus-
tralian Girl submitted-—with or without the
Girl —to this page before the. end of May.
If the Girl is also forwarded, stamps must
be included for her return. Any other Girls
whose metrical measurements are up to print-
ing standard will be paid for per inch.

Verses by John M, Synge
In Kerry.
We heard the thrushes by the shore and sea,
And saw the golden stars’ nativity,
Then round we went the lane by Thomas
Flynn,
Across the church where bones lie out and
in;
And there I asked beneath a lonely cloud
Of strange delight, with one bird singing
loud,
What change you’d wrought in graveyard,
rock and sea,
This new wild paradise to wake for me....
Yet knew no more than knew those merry
sins
Had built this stack of thigh-bones, jaws
and shins.
Danny.
One night a score of Erris men,
A score I’m told and nine,
Said: “We’ll get shut of Danny’s noise
Of girls and widows dyin’.
“There’s not his like from Binghamstown
To Boyle and Ballycroy,
At playing hell on decent girls,
At beating man and boy.
,i “He’s left two pair of female twips
Beyond in Killacreest,
And twice in Crossmolina fair
He’s struck the parish priest.
“But we’ll come round him in the night,
A mile beyond the. Mullet;
Ten will quench his bloody eyes,
And ten will choke his gullet.”
It wasn’t long till Danny came,
From Bangor making way,
And he was damning moon and stars
And whistling grand and gay.
Till in a gap of hazel glen—
And not a hare in sight—
Out lepped the nine-aud-twenty lads
Along his left and right.
Then Danny smashed the nose on Byrne,
He split the lips on three,
And bit across the right-hand thumb
Of one Red Shawn Magee?
But seven tripped him up behind,
And seven kicked before,
And seven squeezed around his throat
Till Danny kicked no more.
Then some destroyed him with their heels,
Some tramped him in the mud,
Some stole his' purse and timber pipe,
And some washed off his blood.
And ■When you’re walking out the way
From Bangor to Belmullet,
You'll see a flat cross on a stone
Where men choked Danny’s gullet.
A Question.
I asked if I got sick and died, would you
With my black funeral go walking, too,
If you’d stand close to hear them talk
and pray, • > ■■■
While I’m let down in that steep bank of
. clay ? . .• ■ . .....
And, No, you said, for if you saw a crew
Of living idiots pressing round that new
Oak coffin—they alive, I dead beneath
That board —you’d rave and rend them
with your teeth.

The N.S.W. Bookstall Co., having se-
cured the right of publishing certain Ameri-
can books in cheap editions, starts with
What’s-His-Name, by George Barr McCut-
cheon, as a shilling’s worth. The whole of
the printing has been done locally, the illus-
trations are presumably of American origin,
and the book conforms in appearance to the
well-known Bookstall series. Sixpenny
editions of other American novels arc an-
nounced.
John Baillie, who 15 years ago left
Maoriland to pursue Art in London, has
evidently caught up that elusive maiden;
as he now returns to Maoriland with a selec-
tion of over 400 modern works of art for
exhibition throughout the narrow streak of
Dominion. As John Baillie owns one of
the largest private galleries in the centre of
London, and has won a name as a brilliant
art connoisseur, the collection, thoroughly
representative of the leading art societies
and exhibitions of England, with labels like
R.A., R.8.A., Royal Scotch Academy,
R.S.W.C., tacked on to nearly every exhibi-
tor, will cause the artistic shock to the
Dominion to be mistaken for the weekly
earthquake. There is a chance of the show
coming to Melbourne; and the directors of
the Sydney, National Gallery intend to have
the first pick when the exhibition opens in
Wellington, this month.
Received: The New Zealand Tear Book,
1911, and Hasell's Annual, 1912. Both in-
dispensable work's are stored with the gritty
food that editors are reared on. Is it too
much to hope that some day one of the com-
pilers of these useful annuals will die and
give us a year book of Hell —or, possibly,
Heaven? It need come out only once an
eternity.

Never Failing Efficiency
is guaranteed to all cyclists using the Eadie Coaster
or the Eadie Two-Speed Coaster. The
Eadie Coaster
contains the “brake which never fails”—the brake that
immediately to the slightest backward pressure of
the pedals, and enables the rider to coast down the steepest
hill in safety and negotiate dense traffic with ease. The
Eadie Two-Speed Coaster
is identical with the Eadie Coaster, but has the addi-

“Bye Say”: A most amusing blunder in this year
of stoush was perpetrated the other day by the pug.
paragraphist of a western (N;S.AV.) newspaper.
Lightweights Goodwin and Gleeson battered each
other in a rather one-sided contest, Goodwin doing
most of the smite, and gaining the referee’s verdict.
But to everybody’s astonishment, the paper came out
with a detailed report of the gore-spilling, in which
Gleeson won easily. In fact, according to the report,
he smote Goodwin from Genesis to George Reid. In
the midst of the amazement it was explained that
the stoush scribe had mistaken the identity of the
pugs. He thought Gleeson was Goodwin all the time,
and proclaimed him the winner, accordingly. After
all, when- you come to think of it, one pug. is very
like another, and when- you get two of them together
.it matters very little which is which.
A shocking misprint occurred in Adelaide Register
of 25/3/’l2. It was being explained that at a kind
of niothers’ meeting the mothers were regaled with
•“bread and butter afid cake,” but seven devils en-
tered into the compositor, and he made it “bread and
ibutter and ale.” Now many beerless mothers want
that man’s life. This recalls Hobart Mercury’s bad,
break of years ago. The New Town had
Ibeenj regaied, but a frugal comtaittee couldn’t afford"
both cheese and butter with their bread, and made
them take their choice. “Some bad butter, some bad
cheese,” said the Mercury, recording the incident.
Now we shan’t be long. We shall all know pres-
ently how to write profitable’ plays arid dra\v
£lO,OOO a year in royalties. Chapman and Hall
are , publishing a volume entitled “Playmaking,” by
William Archer, who once rounded up ■ the insurrec-
tionary bullock on his father’s station near Rock-
hampton. AVilliam is the son of the late Thomas
Archer, one-time Agent-General for Queensland. _ Get-
ting tired of bullock-punching and boundary-riding,
AVilliam migrated from Queensland with the manu-
script of a play called “The Bushrangers,” founded
on the doings of Ned Kelly and co. This was pro-
duced at the Grecian Theatre without making Reason
totter on its throne. A cheeky attack on Henry
Irving—“ The Fashionable Tragedian”—was more suc-
cessful in bringing William into public notice, and
he was appointed dramatic critic of the World. He
also began to write on the drama in the magazines.
He was one of the earlier English champions of
Ibsen, most of whose dramas he translated for Lon-
don production. Chapman and Hall s preliminary
par. about W.A.’s forthcoming book says: “There
does not exist in England any recognised handbook
of practical dramatic craftsmanship. This void William
Archer essays to fill. He admits that no rules can
supply the place of talent, but believes that inexperi-
enced ability may be greatly assisted by a study of
the principles of theatrical effect.”
“Bookware”: Oscar Asche’s “Kismet” will sell
out all the cheap “Arabian Nights,” even as “The
House of Temperley” sold the cheap editions of
“Rodney Stone.” The basis of the “Arabian Nights”
came from India, and filtered through Persia.
Asiatic scholars readily discern which yarns are
Indian, Persian or Arabic. There was an idea that
the original book of tales was put together for the
granddaughter of Esther and Ahasuerus, which is
Hebrew for Artaxerxes, supposed by some on bad
authority to be the Xerxes who invaded Europe.
There is a slight resemblance between Esther and
Scherazade, who kept herself alive with these curtain
lectures. The earliest reference to the “Arabian
Nights” in other literature is in the Arabic of the
10th century. An expanded collection was made
in Egypt in the 15th century, and Europe received
all from Egypt. The “Arabian kept on with
accretions like the Bible or Talmud. Certain
scholars maintain that both Hbmer and the “Arabian
Nights” originated before the invention of writing.
The “Arabian Nights” did not come under European
notice, except with rare scholars, until Galland made
a translation, in Paris, early in the 18th century.
The merits were perceived immediately. Yet the
sources of 10 of the best tales, including “Aladdin,”
could not be found, and Galland was supposed to j
have invented them. Captain Burton ultimately
traced “Aladdin” and another, and it is believed now ,
that all are Asiatic. Lane, after long residence in
Cairo, issued his new and greatly amplified transla-
tion. Then came Burton’s amplification, with such
terrible indecency that his widow tried to suppress
the whole edition. She issued a new one, expur-
gated. Much longer than the familiar “Arabian
Nights.” #
“8.J.”: Herewith a couple of peals of thunder
from the issue of March 20 of the King Island
Record: “Infinitely more deserving of the scornful
opprobrium attaching to the name of ‘prostitute,’
with which society banns these poor dears” [i.e,,
Flossie, Tottie, Magdalen and Co.] “is the man who.
for the sake of salary and position, uses the mental
powers the good God has given him, in order that
he may guide the people to right ways of thinking ,
and acting, and degrades those powers to base and :
servile uses, pandering to the scoundrels who are
undoing the State by base and cunning evasion of
the laws. Of such is that damned little ass ——-.
who sits in the editorial chair at the office, and
daily assists in bewildering the already fogged minds
of the foolish, smug, mammon-worshipping Launces-
ton people with a pretence of wisdom in his put.tv-
w'tted, illogical leaders.” A member of the Flv-’
speck’s Upper Tomb of Fossils is elegantlv em-
balmed as “that muddv-witted liar and idiot, the
dishonorable while in another part of the
paper there is a’reference to a citizen “who ha"
s<sentiy’ io-'ned the dishonorable little company of the
-forger,' the land-grabber, the oath-breaker, the child-
debaucher and the liar who at present hold the seats
upon the King Island bench.”
A President of Whittlesea (Vic.) • has in his pos-
• session an old newspaper, the MEtBWURNE Adver-
. tiser,’written for and publislibd by J. P. Fawkner.
It is dated Monday, January 8, 1838. It is No. 2 of
the series, No. 1 having been - published on Monday,
January 1. The price was 6d. per cojpy, and it was.-
published weekly for nine weeks. Then Fawkner suc-
ceeded in getting some type and a press from Laun-
ceston, and launched a newspaper of the orthodox
character. The paper consisted of four pages, all
written by hand. The copy at Whittlesea is in a
splendid state of preservation. The full sheet, opened
out, measures 13in. by 17in. The first two pages
. consist of advertisements, worded in quaint old
fashion. The other two pages are news. In Bon-
. wick’s “Port Phillip” is published a facsimile of No.
8, full size. -?

restored her to health and strength
after a severe illness in a leading

after a trip to the Mountains failed
to give her nerve strength. She
writes from the Criterion Theatre
(Willoughby Comedy Co. manage-

CDEMENTS TONIC LIMITED .
“At the beginning of last year I was'yjery ill in a private hospital at
Darlinghurst for some weeks. Although,''i recovered, I could not get
bach my strength, so went to the Mountains for a change.
“Even this did me little good; my nerves went from bad to worse.
When away a friend of mine advised me to try CLEMENTS TONIC,
which I did. Now I cannot possibly speak too highly of the benefit 1
derived from its use. I now sleep well and feel strong again, and have
had no recurrence of my nervous attacks.
“I can certainly most highly recommend Clements Tonic to all
suffering from loss of strength and poor appetite. It is a wonderful
health restorer. “(Signed) “VIOLET PAGET.”

FLAT-CHESTED WOMEN!
Misfortune may have been your lot in so far as natural de-
velopment was concerned, but science has found a way to cor-
rect your deficiency. Even though you have never been full-
bosomed, and although you have been attenuated all your
life, if you suffer from no wasting disease your bosom can be
fully developed and your weight increased to normal.
It is the refreshing firmness and delightfjjl fulness of the
feminine form that captivates, and the woman who is most
perfectly developed is the one who monopolises the endear-
ments of the opposite sex.
No woman need stay thin and undeveloped. Dr. Falliere’s
Flesh-food is a harmless, perfect, flesh-builder. It increases

VARIOVS VERSE
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
To the Fat Ox at the Show.
Oh! fatted beast with coat of wond’rous sheen,
I wonder what you’ll weigh,
When you are butchered after you have seen
A bushman’s holiday.
I wonder whose will be the lucky prize,
And what his guess will be,
When you have lured ten thousand prying eyes
To your anatomy.
How many million blades of growing grass
Went down your spacious throat?
Through what internal process did they pass,
Your vasty hide to bloat?
How many hundred miles did you essay
In wind and wet and heat?
How often did you look upon the hay,
And on the waving wheat?
And all for what ? To sate the gambling lust;
To have your captors- try
To guess the weight of you, bovine robust,
That bitter day you die!
To give the dainty damsel and her “boy”
A sporting chance to win
The wherewithal for sweet, elusive joy,
When you have shed your skin!
No; I, for one, did not attempt to guess
Your disembowell’d weight;
Yet, in your sad and soft-eyed loneliness,
Too well I guessed your fate. j
But cheer up, lone and corpulent old ox;
For this you well might say:
You helped to make, in way, unorthodox, '
A Sydney holiday!

GILROONEY.
The Southern Sacrifice.
On the 9th, after the storm, 18in. of wet snow
covered the originally soft surface. We could not
have advanced at all had not the leading pony worn
snow-shoes. The men hauled on the ski. It took 14
hours, without a meal, to do eight miles. At the
first halt the ponies were destroyed, as we had no
more forage for them.— An extract from Captain
Scott’s Antarctic dairy.
What weird, cold-hearted exiles’ land is this,
Where they, our masters, go?-
Where whistling winds on icy pinions hiss
Through stinging sleet and snow.
Why were we taken from that sylvan place
Where green-banked rivers wind ;
Where over brook and bramble we might race,
And leave the winds behind?
Warm suns that splashed the silver on the hills;
Warm winds that tossed our manes;
Cool shades, wherein our friend, the magpie, trills;
And blooms that limn the lanes;
The scent of clover from the river-bend ;
And trefoil in the mouth—
Ah, cruel fate that took us to earth’s end,
To suffer in the south.
To wear ungainly snow-shoes and to feel
The ice-ache in our breath;
To feel our north-land-founted blood congeal;
The famine that is Death;
The Polar Lights that shine above our path;
The vast and voiceless powers—
The unremorse of their great pallid wrath—
Why are such terrors ours? •
Whatever have we done that such a fate
Should take the tracks we tread?—
To fill our world with hardship and with hate,
And our dumb hearts with dread.
These frozen lands, and their fierce frosted air,
Were never meant for us;
Then why should we, the driven dumb slaves, bear
The White Man’s incubus ?
The south wind whistles through our fleshless ribs;
The ice-glare scalds our eyes ;
Our weariest and weakest comrade jibs,
And in the soft snow dies.
Oh! visions of that far-off northern land,
Sweet-breath’d with sun and rain.
Oh I grass, and blossoms and soft sparkling sand —
You call us home in vain

It Was a Girl.
It was for Fame the poet bounced upon his office-
stool,
And, groaning-, turned out reams and reams of
really decent stuff.
“Fame—Fame or nothing 1” he announced—and yet
he was no fool,
For, typed and postage paid, these dreams of his
brought cash enough
For stalls, and such; and he could spread himself on
chocolates,
So would his Sunday fair unfurl for him her
kissing-curl,
Its week-day paper-wrappings shed. For Fame he
sued the Fates ?
Fame ? Rot! His lodestar was a girl!
Say, why does Bill the Pusher take to toil, sun-up
to dark,
Among rough, rude, rampageous scenes, where
still his eye discerns
Each morn, new surfaces to break —why flee the
scaring spark
Of fuse that spits—it simply means more work
when he returns?
Why should he track six miles to get big bags of
powder—what ?
Why should he care to twist and twirl steel-drills
and gads, and hurl
Huge rocks across the landscape, sweating after
every shot ?
For beer? Hell, not It’s for a girl 1
And Clarence! When, with hungry eye, with pale
and clammy brow,
He chases up and down the shops, his cheque-book
in his paw,
When to and fro he goes to buy him flashing gauds
—see how
He pounds along in cabs, and stops where brilliant
windows draw
His bleary glance 1 With fretful fuss his restless
glances scour
Big trays of sparkling stones, and whirl upon the
rare, green pearl.
Why has he stooped to labor thus? Why now this
crowded hour?
For love? Well, for »ome sort o’ girl!

It is constructed by a specialist in industrial motors, to withstand the haidest
conditions and severest usage. . w „ v tri
The “Halley” is simple in construction. Anyone soon learns the

How to Address Letters.
Correspondents to Tim Bulletin would oblige the
paper (and, to an extent, themselves) by taking
some care as to methods of address.
Business letters (with regard to subscriptions, ad-
vertisements, etc.) should in no case be addressed to
the Editor, but to the Manager. To send them to
the Editor is to invite inattention.
It is not a good thing to address editorial letters
to anyone by name. “The Editor, The Bulletin,” is
the proper superscription for “copy.” Delay, and
even loss, is sometimes caused by addressing to per-
sons instead of officials. The person may not be
there; the official always is.

TASMANIA HAS AN ELECTION.
Tasmania has an election on hand just now,
though that State wears such a consistent
aspect of unimportance that the fact
excites little notice on the mainland,
and not much on the island itself.
x\n air of unreality is over the whole
business, and there is a lack of any definite
policy on either side. The party out of office
says, quite truly, and on the clearest evi-
dence, that the party in office had made a
grievous mess of things for many years. The
party in office says, on no evidence except
its own say-so, that the party out of office
will be a great deal worse if it gets a turn
at the loaves and the fish. The Tory de-
clares that, if he keeps his job, he will put
everything right, which, on his record, looks
a glaring absurdity. The Laborite says that,
if he gets the job, he will put everything right,
but he doesn’t say very clearly how. He
doesn’t seem to be a man with very large
ideas, but then it is difficult to be brought
up in the old Tasmanian atmosphere and
possess large ideas. His opponent
seems to be a man without large
ideas either. It is a serious question
whether Tasmania really wants a general
election. It might be a good device to sus-
pend the whole State apparatus for, say,
three years, and let the place be run by
Federal Commissioners, while an . earnest
Federal inquiry is made into the causes of
the wonderful dry rot. It would be a
strenuous measure, but then the case is some-
thing beyond . the average.
That there is something wrong—some-
thing deep-seated and far-reaching and enor-
mous —is plain for all the world to see. Tas-
mania is the most blessed of the S cates, and
also the most backward. It suggests, in a
small, modified way, France before the Re-
volution —that old France which was about
the richest country in Europe, and hardly
possessed a cent. It is, also in a small and
modified way, like Britain to-day—the richest
country in the world, where the Government
is full of good intentions, and one-third of
the people hardly know where their next
meal is to come from. Providence gave
Tasmania an earlier start than most of the
States. It has no droughts, nor even any
badly-watered localities, like the unfortunate
mainland States. It isn’t hampered by the
great dry distances, which make it such a
very long way between drinks in places like
West Queensland. It has a number of good
harbors, including almost the best one in
Australia, and it has a supply of cheap water
power which should make it the greatest,
cheapest and most prosperous manufacturing
region in these parts. It has gold, silver,
lead, copper, tin, coal, iron, bismuth —in
fact it has, for its size, about the most
wonderful and varied stock of minerals
imaginable. It has more known mineral
wealth per square mile than any of its
neighbors. In 1910. the last year for which
the writer has figures before him, it pro-
duced 31 times the value in minerals that
S.A. did (yet S.A. is 14 times its size) ;
nearly half as much as Queensland (and
Queensland is about 25 times its size), and
more than half as much as Victoria (Vic-
toria is more than three times its size). It
raises by far the best crops to the acre in the
Commonwealth. It is a splendidly healthy
region, _ and has no nigger problems.
And it isn’t overcrowded. In fact,
it is much less densely peopled than
Maoriland, and Maoriland is a live place,
with boundless faith in its future.
* * * *
And out of all these glories and advan-
tages what great results have accrued? Tas-
mania is a consistent exporter of its young
population. In 1908,. 1909 and 1910" (the
figures for 1911 are not available) it was
the only State which sent away more people
than it received all the time. It lost more
in 1909 than in 1.908, and it lost more in 1910
than in 1909. It is the business of every
strenuous youth to get away to drought-
cursed Australia, where things are not dead.
The island, despite its healthy climate, has
a far larger proportion of its population on
the old age pension list and the invalid pen-
sion list than even the least fortunate of
its neighbors, and this can only be ascribed
to the fact that it is, most distinctively, the
State of the aged, the derelicts, the has-beens,
and the left-behind. It has by far the
worst paying railway system in the Com-
monwealth, and the only one which, even in
the recent good times, has been on the down-
grade. It has the poorest Slate revenue per
head, and the worst record for illiteracy, and
the most primitive-looking capital, and it is
the only State which has been driven to ap-
ply to the Federal Treasury for a dole. It
has the worst-paid teachers and police and
legislators, and (incidentally) the smallest
drink bill. Except as regards the West
Coast mining industry, it is distinctively the
low-wage State of the group. The whale
fishery is dead. The once great ship-build-
ing industry is practically gone. The last
Tasmanian steamship concern has been sold
to Maorilanders. The local fire insurance
companies have mostly sold themselves to
outsiders or dropped out. A local life as-
surance concern, which is faintly indicated
in some early records, passed out of notice
very long ago, and no one seems to know
how it died. According to Henniker
Heaton’s very old Dictionary of Dates,
Tasmania possessed, nearly 40 years ago,
five soap and six candle factories, whereas
the latest volume of Knibbs’s Official
Year Book, mentions only two altogether,
with 39 employees. The 41 agricultural imple-
ment works appear to have dropped to seven,
and the 19 beer factories to six. Tasmanian
savings bank deposits represent £9 Is. 9d.
per inhabitant, whereas those of barren S.
Australia are £lB 2s. 7d., and the average for
the Commonwealth is £l3 Bs. sd. Its de-
posits in ordinary banks represent about £2O
per inhabitant, against a Commonwealth)
average of about £3O. It has the smallest
commerce per head. To sum up a story
which threatens to grow monotonous, Tas-
mania. the most favored of the six States
by nature, somehow contrives to be at the
tail-end of almost everything.
The only reason which can be assigned
for this lamentable situation is Tory Gov-
ernment, and the amazing faith in borrow-
ing, Private Enterprise, Freetrade and the
influx of foreign capital, by which Tory-
ism is always distinguished, and by which
a section of the Labor party is distinguished
a great deal too often. A vastly larger pro-
portion of the debt of Tasmania was in-
curred for unproductive purposes, and is a
mere dead weight or dead horse on the com-
munity, than is the case in any other State.
The ancient Tory believed that the introduc-
tion of foreign capital was good under any
circumstances, and no matter how the capi-
tal was used. Apparently, judging from the i
way new loans are expended, the ancient
Tory hasn’t learned anything. Nearly one-
third of the isle’s railways are owned by
private companies, mostly financed by out-
side capital, while, on the mainland less
than one-ninth are privately owned. As
late as 1910 every yard of tramline on
Tassy soil was owned by Private Enterprise,
and foreign Private Enterprise at that. An
unusually large proportion of the lands,
mines, banking and insurance business, and.
as already mentioned, practically the whole of
the steamship business belongs to outside
capitalists. And there is talk of jobbing
away to outsiders the water power of the
Great Lake. Never once, in all the years
gone by, did it strike the lamentable Tory
that all this influx of foreign capital was a
mere selling of the country into bondage,
and selling it very cheap. The habit was
maintained till Tasmania has become an-
other Ireland —the land par excellence of
the absentee. It is a nigger working for a
foreign master. The Tory hadn’t even sense
enough to be a good Protectionist. He
levied an amazingly high revenue tariff, but
he never got beyond the revenue tariff idea.
An ordinary election is of no value to a
State thus circumstanced, and the ordinary
policies don’t apply. The principal work of
the next 10 years should be to. get rid, as
far as possible, of the outside capitalist. It
can’t be done by any one device. No single
nostrum that was ever bottled could meet
such a case. A few methods which might
be tried are the following:—
(1) Establishment of a State life assurance de-
partment to keep some of that business in the island.
(2) Establishment, with the same end in view, of
a State fire insurance department, which will get all
the Government business.
(3) Legal prohibition of the sale of the goodwill
and assets of any Tasmanian corporation (there are
a few still left) to any person or persons outside the
State.
(4) Legal prohibition of the granting of any rail-
way, tramway, lighting, power, mining or other con-
cessions to companies of which at least 75 per cent,
of the shares are not held in Tasmania.
(5) Special tax on dividends and profits which
are paid to shareholders or partners outside the
State. Also tax on share transfers to outsiders.
No transfers whatever to be registered if they will
reduce the Tasmanian holdings below 75 per cent.
(6) Special State tax on large estates, in order to
compel the V.D.L. Co. and its kin to break up their
sinfully vast holdings. Tax on farm rents, to dis-
courage landlordism. Legal enactment that the oc-
cupier of agricultural land shall have a right of com-
pulsory purchase from his landlord at a price to be
fixed by some independent public authority. The
object of all this being to make the man who is on
the land—the man who isn’t an absentee —also the
owner of the property. In addition, and by way of
making the V.D.L. Co. sit up something extra, tax
on unused private lands.
(7) Establishment of a vigorous State land bank
policy, to take the mortgage out of the hands of
outsiders.
(8) Re-establishment, whenever possible, of the
Tasmanian steam shipping business, either by the
creation of a State-owned service or a service owned
by a local company, of which the State is a partner.
(9) Resumption, whenever possible, of the exist-
ing private railways and tramways that are in the
hands of outside capitalists.
(10) Abolition of borrowing, except for purely re-
productive purposes. Also, abolition of all borrow-
ing at the earliest possible date.
(11) A serious attempt to be made by the State
to render available and sell to local manufacturers
that magnificent water power which should make
Tasmania the great industrial section of the Com-
monwealth.
These are a few suggestions towards a
policy for the repair of broken-down Tas-
mania. They are all financial, but the very
beginning of reform must be an attempt to
stop the outflow of tribute to the blessed in-
dividual who used to be encouraged to “bring
capital into the country.” Tasmania is a
land of low wages and long hours, but the
wages are low, in a great measure, because
there isn’t much money left after paying the
person who brought capital into the coun-
try, and hours are long because everybody
has to put in an extra spell of toil for the
benefit of the extraneous owner or mortgagee.
In some of the other States the natural first
demand of Labor is for the better distribu-
tion of wealth. In Tasmania the first busi-
ness is to get a little locally-owned wealth
to distribute, and the better distribution
comes next.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Influence, Indolence and Blow the
Consequences.
Dear Bulletin, —A dubious, hesitating
par which appeared in that timid little
S. M. ’Erald of ours, last week, impels me
to ask a question of the gentleman who runs
the Ma State’s Public Works Department.
I believe his name is Griffith, and he is
supposed to be slow but sure. I fancy he is
slow but buried. Let it be remembered that
N.S.W. secured for its State-owned Cockatoo
Dock the whole job of building or putting
together the warships of the new Australian
fleet. It got it on the solid principle that
Sydney is entitled to all the jobs that are
going. Now the par. which rouses me, and
which ought to rouse Australia everywhere
outside of Congested Sydney said that: —
Yesterday H.M.A.S. Warrego, which was launched
about a year ago, the first warship built in Aus-
tralia, left the Cockatoo Island wharf under her own
steam, and went to Berry’s Bay. She was met there
by the tug Lena, and went through the process of
the adjustment of her compasses preparatpry to mak-
ing her sea trials, which will probably take place
to-day.
Now, Mr. Australia is a slightly heed-
less and entirely forgetful person in many
things, and though the number of him who
could tell you , what won the Cup, or the
Plate, or some other piece of crockery in
1876 is legion, the number of him who could
tell you when the Warrego (a mere cockle-
shell, as navy ships go) was first built is
about 311. Counting myself, it is 312. £
know that this little boat was built, in Glas-
gow somewhere towards the end of 1909
or the beginning of 1910, was taken to pieces
and “re-erected” at the Ala State’s pet in-
stitution, the Cockatoo Dock, Sydney, and
launched on April 4, 1911. Will Mr. Aus-
tralia please note that? It took 12 solid
months to take the pieces (all carefully
marked and numbered) out of the cases and
straw and brown paper, and screw or bolt
or rivet them together! The original build-
ers did the actual job in a few weeks. After
making every allowance for the great ques-
tion of Dirt Money, and for all the other
great questions that thrill the hearts of the
Cockatoo Islanders, I ask Mr. Griffith to
say whether the Ma State can be proud of
the record? But, hold op! It has taken
another year to get the little vessel as far
as the very ordinary job of “swinging” her
for compass-adjustment—a job the ’Erald
evidently thinks a terrific one, whereas three
men and a boy could do it with the assist-
ance of the usual tug. All the really im-
portant trials lie ahead. These trials, it
was confidently said in 1909 (the time the
ship was actually being built), would be
completed by September, 1910. In Sep-
tember, 1910, the Cockatoo Islanders weren’t
so sure; still, they hopefully mentioned
March, 1911. In April, 1911, the ship, or
toy, was triumphantly re-launched. Since
then, if Mr. Australia will glance at his
Sporting Calendar, he will find that another
good year has rolled, or flown, or passed
away! By the smell of the briny little
’Erald par., aforesaid; by the loud and sig-
nificant silence of the blatant Sydney press
—which wrote columns of the most foolish
bosh, two years ago, about the record the
Cockatoo Islanders had or would put up—and
have put up—and by the earnest wrestlings
of Fisher and Pearce to get Griffith even
to name a time-limit for the building of war-
ships at the Parrot Dockyard—also by the
appointment of a special “speeding up” com-
mittee for the said dock, and by the dread-
ful contortions of Griffith to avoid Fisher
and Pearce’s request—by all these things
it looks to me as if the efficiency of Mr.
Australia’s future fleet is to be a perfectly
minor consideration, when shoved along-
side of the glorious Dirt Money question,
and the ALL-For-Sydney policy and the
interests of Ma! Why, Mort’s Dock would
have turned out half a dozen “re-erected”
Warregos in two years; and I am told that
Williamstown (Vic.) has at least two ship-
building firms ready and anxious to give the
required guarantees. But, of course, with
McGowen and Griffith and the Sydney
Labor leaders —who in this respect are even
worse than the old All-For-Sydney Con-
gested Blokes —the sacred rights of the
Cockatoo Islanders, and the great god Dirt
Money, are to be held far above the needs
of mere Mr. Australia. And so, to come
to the question, I want to ask Mr. Griffith
what prevents him (with all the allegedly-
unparalleled resources and staff, and general
frill and dog), from giving the Federal Gov-
ernment (and mere Mr. Australia) the
entirely moderate, and reasonable, and
business-like guarantee that is needed? —
Yours, etc., O.C.C.
A Case for “With Costs.’’
In giving judgment on the application to can-
cel the registration of the Australian Tiam-
way Employees’ Association, Justice Higgins
pointed to much-needed amendments in the
Arbitration Act. He first condemned the ap-
plication as spurious, inasmuch as none of
the applicants had put a penny of their own
money towards the costs, the Melbourne ones
being financed by a Liberal League, and the
precious Independent Workers’ Union and the
Brisbane counsel being instructed by the
Crown Solicitor of Queensland: —though what
right he had in the argument Heaven only
knows —and, further, because the applicants
had all resigned from the association at-
tacked, though their resignations could not
take effect while the plaint was being heard.
Assuming, however, that the persons applying
for de-registration were genuine applicants,
he decided against them in toto, and on all
grounds. Further, and this is where the
Act needs amending, he badly wanted to give
costs against them, but had no power to do
so. Obviously, it is unfair and unreasonable,
as Vic. Treasurer Watt would say, that half
a dozen men of straw, or a political league, or
anybody at all, should put a genuine indus-
trial union to a lot of expense out ~f pure
cantankerousness. Also, Mr. Higgins con-
demned the fact that he was, under Section
60, compelled to order the cancellation of
registration if any one of half a dozen more
or less technical lapses had been proved
against the association —if, for instance, an
ingenious enemy should find a mistake —an
honest, harmless mistake —of a shilling or a
penny in the accounts. No opportunity was
given to correct such errors; Parliament had
left him no discretion but to order the can-
cellation, though quite possibly it had no such
intention when it drew up the Act. From
which it appears that genuine industrial or-
ganisations may congratulate themselves on
having Justice Higgins presiding over the
Court. But he won’t always be there, and
he may be succeeded by a mere techni-
cal. parchment-loving, precedent-worshiuning
man.
O
The Perils of the Beep ; with Special
.Reference to Underloaded Ships.
Australian waters, owing to the appalling
shipping disasters that have occurred in them
of late, threaten shortly to achieve the un-
savory reputation for murderousness which
was held by , the Strait of Messina in
Homer’s day. Terrific gales are certainly
encountered hereabouts from time _ to tlifie ;
but nothing in this line should seriously in-
convenience a well-found modern ship.
There is the factor of the unwatched light.
Nautical authorities of high standing claim
that beacons of this sort are liable to be as
perilous to seafarers as the homicidal flares
of* the Cornish wreckers. There is a dark
yarn drifting round that the light was out on
Bedout Island when and where the Koom-
bana disappeared. Skippers and their sub-
ordinates are liable to get drunk or grow
careless; to hug a reef-infested coast; to err
as regards their whereabouts —by these and
a thousand other means which cannot well
be guarded against the lives of deep-sea ships
and those who frequent them are endangered.
Also, there are dangers which can be guarded
against, but aren’t. Chief among them is
the fact that, when cargo happens 1 to be
scarce, ships often put to spa in an under-
loaded condition. Since the passing of
the Merchant Shipping Act (1876) it
has been dangerous for an owner to
send out his vessel in an overcharged
state But there is no legislation here,
or elsewhere, to prevent him speeding
the craft forth, on the blue seas, with its
hold so empty that its instability is visible
to the eye of the merest land-lubber. And
yet an under-ballasted ship is really a far
more dangerous sea vehicle than an over-
ballasted one. The latter will at least steam
and steer; the former, with its rudder and
screw well out of the water,, will, often,
decline to do either in a satisfactory
manner. The further it goes the
safer the overloaded steamer becomes,
for it lightens itself steadily by the consump-
tion of its bunker coal, while the ship with,
little cargo and an undue economy in the way.
of ballast grows more unsafe every hour of
its trip. In this connection it is reported
that the Koombana.started on its last voyage
with very little cargo. It is alleged td have
ridden so high that its screw was partly 911!
of the water, and it is described as “rolling
heavily,” even before its real troubles be°*an.
Agaim one of the things which every habitual
traveller in these regions knows, and
shudders at, is that there are fine-bottomed,
shallow-drafted vessels running round Aus-
tralia’s storm-battered coasts, with high and
heavy superstructures, huge ’tween-deck
bunkers, cattle decks, and bullion and sojrit
rooms, all many feet above the water line_
They are liable to leave port, regardless of
the time of year, with these upper spaces
filled chock-a-block, and their decks encum-
bered with tons of fruit, harvesting ma-
chinery and so forth, and little or nothing in
their lower holds. It was bv taking just
such a chance that the s.s. Yarmouth was
blown clean over in the English Channel and
lost with all hands. This ship had next to
nothing in its holds, aud manv tons of furni-
ture vans on deck. Lord Muskerry intro-
duced a Light Load Line Bill into the
of Lords, to meet such cases, but it came to


nothing. The question arises whether some
measure of the sort isn’t urgently needed
here. It is a reasonable proposition that no
ship should be allowed to leave port unless it
is weighted sufficiently to be safe—the ques-
tion of the minimum safe draft in
each individual case being a matter for ex-
perts to decide. As to the practice of crowd-
ing fruit, machinery and sundries on deck, it
should, at any rate in the case of under-
loaded ships, be made a criminal offence.
By prompt attention to this matter Aus-
tralia might save a large crowd of valuable
lives, not to mention quantities of Property.
A Joyous Situation for Law Breakers.
According to Judges, lawyers, the police
authorities and others who should be in the
way of knowing, crime has been steadily on
the increase in N. S. Wales during the past
two years. As to its accentuation in the
course of the last six months, there is not
the faintest doubt. There was a record num-
ber of cases at the Central Police Court
(Sydney) on the Saturday after Good Fri-
day, and most of the other metropolitan
courts had unprecedented tallies of law-
breakers and drunks—though under the
existing Liquor Act the pubs” are shut
on" the day' when the Socialistic circus
at! Moore Park makes its great effort. The
same tendency is to be observed in the coun-
try towns. An epidemic of burglaries is
raging briskly in the Sydney suburbs. It is
significant that most of the attempts on the
property ..of sleeping lieges are distinguished
by an ineffectiveness which marks the ’pren-
tice hand —the sort of hand whose owner has
only taken to a life of crime for the reason
that it appears for the moment an unusually
safe way of amassing a dishonest pile. The
“push” business is said to be looking up.
In a thousand humble homes, breadwinners
and others are understood to be polishing up
long disused knuckledusters, assiduously
charging sandbags, and practising at sta-
tionary and running "marks with blue-metal.
As the S. M. Herald —normally so franti-
cally jealous of the fair fame of the Ma
capital—put it the other morning:—-
The worst feature of the lawlessness' on Good
Friday was, perhaps, the number of assaults on the
police, which are increasing considerably of late. At
Surry Hills there was one outburst which was nracti-
cally a riot. When the police arrived at the Central
with some of the offenders, a crowd following up, a
lump of blue metal was thrown, and it just missed
a policeman’s head. When picked up it was found
to be fully one-third the size of■*; brick. This fol-
lowed the outrage on a constable a few days ago,
when he was hit in the eye with a lump of road
metal, and it is feared that he will lose the sight of
the injured organ.
In short, there is a pronounced boom in the
matter of contempt of Law and Order. These
things don’t happen fortuitously. There is
always an explanation of them if it is only
delved for with intelligence and care —especi-
ally intelligence. In the present instance, (
the reason is not far to seek. The State Is 1
absurdly under-policed, and an undue pro-
portion of the police which the State has are
deficient in size, strength, mental capacity
and numerous other essentials. Important
towns, such as Bathurst, are for ever pro-
testing against the inadequate police protec-
tion that is accorded them. The writer spent
some time in Bathurst recently, and during
most of that period three none-too-brilliant
John Dunns had the job of guarding the
lives and assets of the 10,000 citizens who
inhabited the place. The average Sydney
suburbanite can wander round the streets of
his quarter for half an hour or more, by day
or night, and not encounter a solitary police-
man ; and about the only time the taxpayer
sees his Hop in bulk, as it were, is when a
Governor is going to “open” something, or
when, as a result of a Wowser agitation, a
casual burst of New Year’s revelry or
what not has to be suppressed. Why is the
already exiguous guardian of Law and Order
getting scarcer and smaller and less intelli-
gent day by day, so that the criminal classes
have taken to aiming blue-metal at him
without fear of the consequences, while
persons who never erred before are resorting
to crime as a secure means of getting rich
quickly? The sordid fact is—the N. S. Wales
police force is under-sized, and mentally
underproof and dangerously undermanned
because it is under-paid. The McGowen
Government has not kept its implied promise
to raise the miserable wages of the rank and
file of the force. Meanwhile the cost, of living
goes up gaily. What wonder that the
bright young man of brawn and agility is
enthusiastically giving the risky business of
coiling with law-breakers the go-by, and tak-
ing to unionised callings where the pay is
anything up to twice as high and the danger
about one-sixteenth the amount.
The Cry of Ulster.
The cable tells weird stories of the bump-
tiousness of a small section of Ulster, and
its solemn declarations that the sky will fall
if Ireland acquires some measure of self-
government. Great are said
to have taken place, and a Belfast proces-
sion, 140,000 strong, took three hours to pass
a given point—possibly, a public .house. But
this is a cold day and a luckless hour for
the Manchus, and the bumptious Manchus
of the North of Ireland should cease to
bump, and rather congratulate themselves
that their fate promises to be immeasurably
better than that of their brethren in China.
The position of the small irreconcilable sec-
tion of Ulster is complicated and impossible.
That section constitutes little more than a
bare majority in its own province—that is to
say, all the discordant Protestant sects re-
present 56 per cent, of the population (Pres-
byterians, 27 per cent.; Anglicans, 23 per
cent.; sundries, 6 per cent.), while the
Catholics stand for 44 per cent. In the
other three Irish provinces the Protestants
are in a hopeless minority. The Ulster
Protestants are strangers, who came into
the land just as the Manchus did into China ;
but they didn’t come, as the Manchus did,
by virtue of their own strength and courage.
They were sent there by the British Gov-
ernment some 300 years ago, and, but for the
support received from the British Govern-
ment. they would have collapsed very early.
They came to occupy the lands confiscated
from Irishmen, whose only offence was that
they had resisted annexation. Some of the
early settlers in the Plantation of Ulster
were criminals of the most aggressive order
—Border thieves, murderers and raiders,
who had the option of going to Ulster or
being hanged. Their mission in the North
of Ireland was to promote religious and
racial differences —to be a curse and an open
sore, and a perpetual cause of trouble, so
that the dissensions of the island might
make it easier to maintain English suprem-
acy, They always professed a-vast scorn
and contempt of the place they lived in,
and they always claimed an immeasurable
superiority over the natives of the country.
They made a poor showing in war—their
one boasted venture being the defence
of the fairly strong town of Londonderry
for three months, against a crowd of militia,
mostly armed with pikes. The final howl
of the irreconeilables of Ulster will hardly
be mentioned in history, A rebel army
whose members, before beginning to drill,
make a declaration before a magistrate that
they are only doing it for the sake of exer-
cise and to work off superfluous fat, can
hardly be taken seriously.

A Different Sort of Bishop.
An unusually good sort of an English
bishop— Gore, of Oxford —lately arose
to declare his opinion that “the adequate
payment of the laborer should be the first
charge upon industry.” Whereupon Sydney
Telegraph —which is so loaded up with;
knowledge that in a recent leader it described
Valparaiso as the capital of Chili, and said
that Australia wasn’t discovered in Dr.
Johnson’s days—spoke in a tone of lofty
and dignified reproach. Said the D.T.,
among other things :
This world has few sadder sights than that of the
philanthropist .gggking to pave the way to a settle-
ment of life’s practical problems with nothing but
good intentions.... An example is furnished by Dr.
Gore, Bishop of Oxford, who has just propounded
a formula for ending all. the labor troubles now con-
vulsing the industrial world. His plan is to ignore
the law of supoly And demand, which, he says, can
no longer be allowed to settle wage questions." “The
proper basis for the reconstruction of society,” de-
clares the Bishop, “is the principle that the adequate
payment of the laborer should be the first charge on
industry.” If he believes this to be. the solution of
the oldest of human problems, seeing that it is so
simple and so obvious, he must marvel that if has
not occurred to everyone before. . It is, however, the
first remedy that suggested itself to the first reformer
until practical experience proved the hopeless futility
of it. Nothing is fairer, and nothing would be more
conducive to universal peace and harmony, than that
adequate payment of the laborer should be a first
charge upon industry if it could only be made. so.
But how is it to be done? The Bishop says: Ignore
the law of supply and demand. Let him ignore the
law of gravity so as to be ; able to walk on the air
from house-top to house-top, and he will get an illus-
tration of what ignoring the law of supply and de-
mand means. We may ignore any natural law we
Dlease, but that law will not ignore us,, and thereby
hangs the tale of many a pathetic episode.
It is about T 6 years since the idea of making
the adequate payment of the laborer a first
charge on industry was seriously attempted
in Australia, and the . minimum, wage—or
living wage—principle' has been spreading
ever since. Nothing has in conse-
quence—in fact the evidence is that, in
every industry which is blessed with suffi-
cient Protection to prevent Chinamen and
others breaking in with the products of
sweated industry and upsetting the good
work, the new method has been quite a suc-
cess. The old idea, advocated by George
Reid and his kind, was that Nature or the
Devil, or some other outside authority, has
decreed that the products of some industries
must be sold so cheaply that the people who
work in these industries must live in chronic
misery and hunger, or else that the land on
which some industries are carried on must
multiply so many thousands per cent, in
value that the workers must starve in order
that their employer may make enough profit
to pay his landlord. The very first attempt
at a decent minimum wage law, combined
with a sane tariff, blew the bottom, out _ of
the silly old superstition. The thing which
the unseeing Telegraph declares to be im-
possible is going on all round it—-has been
going on all round it for years—and appar-
ently it doesn’t know. Seemingly, it is as
blankly ignorant about that as it is about
the early navigators who made history
around Australia.
The State Railways that Feed Private
Enterprise.
Dear B. —The retrospect (B. 4/4/’l2) accorded
the N.S.W. Government’s past session,
omitted two important particulars. It threw
no bouquet at Holman for his humane
Criminal Appeal Bill; and, it heaved no
brick at Griffith for his utter neglect to do
something towards connecting two State
railway systems at the Tweed River. Prior
to the 1910 elections, Arthur Griffith
traversed the cow pastures of the North, and
from town to town witheringly jeered at all
past Administrations for their non-construc-
tion of this “Missing Link.” He made
definite promises that, if winners at the
polls, his party would proceed to forge the
Missing Link, even though the result would
mean some of dear old Sydney’s trade flow-
ing Brisbanewards. And surely the geo-
graphical position is one almost without
parallel on this planet. Nowhere else do
two State systems of railway cater so ex-
clusively for Private Ilinderprise. The
N.S.W. railway ends abruptly opposite the
Royal Hotel at Murwillumbah, a rising town
of 3000 inhabitants. The Queensland rail-
way from Brisbane bumps a dead, end at
Tweed Heads, the border town. A navigable
river flows between. Only one firm’s steam-
ers plough its wafers, and three hours and
three shillings are consumed in the process.
On the shorter spans Private flinderprise
levies as much as fivepence per mile.
If the Missing Link is ever forged, through
passengers, besides avoiding the vexatious
process of transhipping at either end, will
be able to negotiate the present hiatus of 19
miles in an hour at Is. 6d. The Tweed could
be bridged above Murwillumbah, where it is
not more than 100yds. wide, and the railway
run down , the left bank of the river. The
Toriest of Tories have mostly “represented”
the district in the Assembly, and they
couldn’t be expected to strike at both the
Sydney mononoly and Private Ilinderprise.
But McGowen and Griffith seerr. no
better, even though Tory Denham over the
border offers to lay the Ma State’s 4ft. 81in.
gauge right into Brisbane. Methinks Arthur
Griffith is not quite so much “up against
monopolies” as he would have us believe. —
Yours, etc., Boswell.

Attorney-General Holman and the
Income Tax.
An extract from the speech of the agile
N.S.W. Treasurer Holman, at Temora on
Saturday (assuming that the daily paper
report is correct) :
We were attacked because we have introduced an
Income Tax Bill. Very well! I ask our critics to.
say plainly, will they repeal it if they come into
power?
It takes a man of boundless assurance to say
a thing like that. The McGowen-Holman
Government introduced an Income Tax Bill
providing that a person who got £lO a year
in dividends from some little Australian
manufacturing company, which employed
white Australian labor at trades-union
wages, would pay an income-tax of Is. 2d.
in the £ (or the company would pay it for
him), while the local landlord, the local
money-lender, and the absentee landlord who
received £3OO a year would pay no-
thing, and even the absentee landlord who
received £IOOO a year would only pay 7d. in
the £. Of course, Holman and co. were
“attacked.” The country had given them! no
mandate to declare war on Australian indus-
try, and on the co-operative principle, and
to become the props and pillars of thC usurer
and the absentee rack-renter. They got their
astounding measure through the Assembly,
but by the time it reached the Council the
“attack” had become so violent that they
cofild only get that nominee body to pass it
and thus save their face by promising to
repeal it themselves at the earliest oppor-
tunity, and substitute a very different
scheme. So there is no longer any need for
anybody to repeal thq Income Tax Bill over
which these people were “attacked.” But
the country still wants to know what was
behind that wonderful scheme which made a
Labor Government pose as the special pro-
tector of the landlord, the money-lender and
the absentee, and what was the .reason of
it. On that subject the country’s lack of in-
formation is ; something lamentabfe.

“Henry H.” : By way of a concession to the
Mf State parochialists who clamor that
everything should be done at Sydney, the
State-owned .Cockatoo Dock has so far got
all the local shipbuilding jobs for the new
Australian navy. A great deal of friction
has already arisen over this matter, though
very little real work has been done. There
have been two principal causes of disagree-
ment. First, the N.S.W. State Government
didn’t want to build any Federal warship in
any specified time. Tit held (fiat the article
ought to be delivered in a year or a century.
Second, it refused to quote any price. Its
idea was. that it should charge the Aus-
tralian Government the actual cost of con-
struction with 8 or 10 per cent, added for
use of plant. And if cost of construction
was three or six or 10 times what it should
be through muddle and incompetence, or
through State' members rushing up wages
and allowances (at Federal expense) iff
order to placate State constituents and
secure State votes —well, apparently the
poor old Commonwealth was just to pay,
and carry all the blame for the extravagance.
It looked about the most absurdly one-
sided arrangement that could be entered into,
if Australia wants an efficient navy, and
isn’t simply making a pretence of ship-
building in order to supply somebody’s
friends with jobs. The Federal Government
isn’t following the day labor principle ; it is
letting out its work by contract without
knowing what the price will be, and with
very little assurance that the goods will be
delivered before they become obsolete. In
return for these lavish concessions, the State
Government persistently declined to supply
a bit of land for a Federal naval college at
Jervis Bay. The N.S.W. Government de-
manded that the Federal capital should be
on N.S.W. territory, but the scrap of ground
which it was willing to grant was so inade-
quate that there is neither room for a Fed-
eral or a seaport town, or wharves,
or a naval college, or half a dozen other neces-
saries. The idea that Australia is an enemy
to be insulted and plundered blocks progress
everywhere.
+.
The stoppage of Victoria’s State Coal Mine
at Wonthaggi is chiefly the result of all
round cantankerousness. A while back, man-
ager Broome abolished the wages system
for miners, and substituted an all-round hew-
ing rate of 3s. per ton. The miners reckoned
this didn’t pay tfiein, but stood to it for a
while till the mine got firmly established.
More recently they told Broome that they
didn’t approve of the night-shift, and that
in future they would only work two shifts
per day. Broome agreed, but intimated
that, as many expenses were going on
just the same whether the mine was
worked for 1(5 hours or 24, the hew-
ing rate would be 2s. 9d. Also, he
stated that as the House of Rich Landlords
had refused, last session, to vote more money
for developmental purposes, he couldn’t ex-
tend the area of employment, and would
have to discharge some 400 men. That
naturally didn’t sweeten the miners’ tem-
pers, and as Broome refused to continue
paying the 3s. hewing rate, they refused to
toil for him further, and resigned just before
Easter. After the holidays the V.C.M.A.
called the men together, and a deputation of
three was selected to seq Broome and talk
matters over. As soon as that rather touchy
gentleman viewed it, he objected to one
particular delegate, and refused further con-
verse till he retired. The delegate in ques-
tion, who had previously had a few words
with an assistant boss or deputy ganger, or
some such, offered to retire, but thje miners
naturally concluded that if Broome ,was
going to select his own delegates it wasn’t
much use their going on with the argument,
and they all retired. So there is a deadlock,
and the mine is idle. Which is about the
best bit of news the House of Rich Land-
lords has heard for a year or more.
That reactionary, and, therefore, illogical,
person, Treasurer Watt, of Victoria, doesn’t
approve of equal electorates for town and
country, and considers it would be “unfair
and unreasonable to suggest that the same
number of people should constitute an elec-
torate in the remote parts of the State as in
the metropolitan area.” He didn’t say why,
possibly because he could give no valid rea-
son, though it is just as unfair and unrea-
sonable for the city toilers to be taxed to
provide a municipal subsidy, so that the
mean, selfish country landowners may avoid
just taxation. It is also, unfair and unrea-
sonable for the country toiler to be persist-
ently kept outside the pale of Minimum
Wage laws, Pure Food and Pure IVfilk Acts;
also, it is unfair and unreasonable for the
State railways to carry the farmers wheat
at a lower rate than the city manufacturer’s
wares. In addition, it is unfair that the
farmer should be compelled to send his wheat
to Port Phillip for the special benefit of
Melbourne, when some, more adjacent pprt
might be both better and cheaper. In fgct,,
a whole lot of things arje “unfair and unrea-
sonable.” Bqt the original and only genuine,
reason why the country electorates were
given more members for less people than
the city ones was that, by reason of their
empty spaces, they were , expected to fill
up more rapidly than the city ones before
the next redistribution of seats happened.
And the fact is they don’t, and never
did. The very contrary is the case,
and the metropolis expands at about
double the ratio of the country. Where-
fore, it is up to Watt to get busy fill-
ing the empty country districts, or else drop
the subject.

From “M.S.”
The Bulletin writer who recently alleged that the
Maitland collieries are ill-ventilated on certain occa-
sions is wrong—that is, unless the local authorities
are the most stupendous liars on record. Under the
heading Ventilation, the Coal Mines Act (Buie 1)
says:—
“An adequate amount of ventilation shall be con-
stantly produced in every mine, to dilute and render
harmless the noxious gases to such an extent that
the working places of the shafts, levels, stables and
workings of the mine, and the travelling roads to and
from those working places, shall be in a fit state for
working and passing therein. The ventilation so
produced shall be the supply of pure air, in quantity
not less than 100 cubic feet per minute for each
man, boy and horse employed in the mine, which air
(in that proportion, but with as much more as the
inspector shall direct) shall sweep along the air-
ways and be forced as far as the face of and into
each and every working place where man, boy or
horse is ■ engaged or passing, main return air-ways
only excepted.”
The Maitland mines claim that, in order to be well
within the. letter, spirit; and every other feature of the
above law, they provide far more than the stipulated
minimum dose of 100 cubic feet of pure air per
minute. In fact, the latest check inspector’s report
T have gives the supply at the colliery visited of over
700 cubic feet of air per minute for each man,'boy
or horse employed. This is over seven times, the
minimum, and the concluding remarks of the report,
which. , it must be remembered, is made by the
employees’ representatives, are: —-
“The mine is well ventilated throughout.
“The working places are'securely timbered.

sequently, 50,000 potential democratic votes; for the
democratic movement is principally recruited from
the youth of Australia. Another factor is the in-

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
It is now admitted that the evolution of man was
a much longer process than has generally been sup-
posed.—Daily ■paper.
A Japanese invasion of Australia may occur, but it
is too remote a contingency to cause serious alarm.
Daily paper.
I looked along the track of weary time,
The beaten track worn ba;re by many feet,
Down winding from the forests of the prime
By many a hoary pub whose wild beer
beat
Terrific exaltation in the blood
Of persons ages older than the flood.
I saw strange heroes of unwashen face
Who died before the elder soap was born.
And somewhat grimy nymphs of wondrous
grace,
Dimpled with smiles, and naked as the
morn.
I heard faint kisses, knew old love-notes
sung
When music was exceeding crude and
young.
I saw old battles fought with stick and
stone,
And ancient Parliaments of horrid sound,
Old kings uplifted on a rocky throne
With very loyal persons grovelling round;
In fact, some hint of all we prize to-day
Had shown itself in ages dim and grey.
Pawnbroking, lying, loving, eating, death,
Were pastimes in those days as well as
ours ;
The human creature spent a lot of breath
Before he stood full-smmned in all his
powers ;
The human female talked for countless years,
Evolving Cissy and our other dears.
The game was slow. Tremendous ages rolled
Their vast thought-tides upon the shores
of doom,
Yet on through tropic heat and glacial cold
The dead years for the larger man made
room —
The splendid person who in times of cheer
Looks his broad triumph o’er exalted beer.
You cannot hurry nature. She must take
Her own appointed time to do her job ;
The coach of progress would be bound to
break
If any wanton person tried to rob
Its ancient driver of her needed rest.
Sit tight, wait patiently, she does her best.
Knowing it took a million years to make
The wisdom of one spieler sharping cards,
And twice as long as that at least to wake
The towering genius of our local bards,
I counsel patience. Let our large hopes chime
With the vast sweeps of geologic time.
Sleep hath her victories no less renowned
Than those of waking. It is good to lie
In slumber till the foeman prancing round
Send the first shell loud-shrieking through
the sky.
What need to trouble? Calmly let-us wait
Till his first legions gather at the gate.
Go to the Old Red Sandstone, mark and
know
The slow molluscan movements in the
rocks ;
A thousand centuries the ancient foe
Spake his loud warning e’er, with battle
shocks,
New strata, trembling through the slimy sea,
Flaunted the scale and fin of victory.
There is no hurry. Asia’s hosts may come ;
But wherefore spend the cash qr make a
row ?
Why blow upon the horn or beat the drum
When it is clear they are not coming now?
If they come later? —Well, such thoughts
will keep—
We shall feel fresher after some more
sleep.

West Gippsland electorate contains roughly 6000
voters, while radical Williamstown contains 20,000
voters. And, finally, Labor is rottenly led.
Prendergast has caught the Sleep Disease from
Yawn Murray, and he has no capacity, no fire, no
initiative—nothing. Labor’s difficulty in getting
candidates for the Leg. Council is due to the strin-
gent property qualification. A candidate has to be
over 30 years of age and possess landed property
amounting to £SO in annual rental, which means
he has to have about £I2OO worth of realty.
“Chasuble”: A Mrs. Jackson is given
space this year for two articles in the Lon-
don Nineteenth Centuky, urging that all
clergy ought to be celibate. This feeling
grows in the Anglican Church, and indeed
everywhere. Why should the subscriptions
be chiefly employed in maintaining wives
and families? Pope Hildebrand, nearly
1000 years after Christ, with all that ex-
perience, fixed the rule of celibacy, and all
subsequent experience has proved its wis-
dom. The celibate priest has the most influ-
ence in families. The clergyman’s wife may
sometimes be an advantage, but is usually a
clog and drawback. The real celibate sol-
dier laughs even at starvation. Compare the
jolly Catholic priest, in the Australian bush,
on his fine, stout nag, with the married
Anglican, or other —a gaunt man. riding a
frame called a horse, with three legs and a
ruin.
“N.1.L.,” from a Melbourne suburb: —
Irish-envoy Donovan, at present sending round the
hat, with his colleagues Hazleton and Redmond,
M’s.P., perpetrated a fine example of the “Bull
Hibernicus” at a Victorian up-country meeting,
lie was speaking of the cablegrams headed “Out-
rages in Ireland,” “More Cattle-maiming,” etc.,
which we sometimes see in our daily news, and was
endeavoring to show that these crimes only existed
in the minds of the cable-mongers, or were manufac-
tured by persons interested. Citing one of the
latter cases, he spoke of a county policeman named
Sheridan, who used to commit cattle-maiming crimes
himself, and then arrest somebody. The orator went
on: “And this man Sheridan went out in the dead
of night, made his way to an unpopular farmer’s
land, and, selecting from his stock the finest cow,
he cut off the unfortunate animal’s tail! And
then —and then what did he do?” Here the speaker
became impressive and deliberate. “He went and
fastened it on to a poor peasant!”
“Shellback”: The judgment of the Federal
Arbitration Court upon the claim of the
Merchant Service Guild considerably im-
proves the position of masters and officers
trading in Australian waters. In addition
to a larger cheque at the end of the month,
an eight-hour day has been established, and
ihe annual leave on pay extended. One
remarkable feature of the judgment was a
clause reserving for further consideration
the question as to whether the Islands
steamer Tathra should be subject to the
award. It is now over three months
since the Tathra went down, with the loss
of 16 lives, and unless Davy Jones is to
be cited as a party to the dispute, it is diffi-
cult to see what the Court will do about the
matter.
“F.C.”: One of the wearinesses of life to
the new politician, and especially to the new
Minister, is the departmental “spectre.”
Every seat of government, I suppose, has a
few of these, all harmless but all a trial. I
only know the Melbourne ones. The de-
partments here used to be
haunted by shabbily dressed
but business-like spectres
from debt-collecting agen-
cies ; but of late years tuese
have vanished. “Queen Caro-
line,” however, still haunts
Spring-street. Her Majesty,
who is ageing somewhat, in-
sists on lodging a claim for
some £28,000,000 in respect
of all the alienated land
of the State, which she
claims by right of sovereignty. She
is quite cheerful over the matter, and is
easily stalled off, but her volubility harasses
her hearers. Lately some official passed her
on to the Federal departments as represen-
tatives of the paramount power, but the Com-
monwealth messengers weren’t taking Caro-
line, and they carefully instilled it into her
that land questions were purely a State
matter. Another happy spectre persistently
seeks audience of Ministers in order to urge
on them the immediate annexation of Tas-
mania. Nothing else on earth matters, and
his grievance will remain till the blessed
island is gathered in. An ex-constable used
to be a regular caller on Chief Secretaries.
His trouble was that he urgently desired
Parliament House to be shifted over to the
Domain by means of balloons. He, like the
late Swampy Graves’ visitor, has disap-
peared. An elderly man regularly called at
the public offices wishing to see Graves. He
had, I believe, an invention for drying and
emDalming deceased members, but I haven’t
the details. It is not recorded that he ever
saw Graves. Others there are with less
obviously impossible claims, and the new
Parliamentarian listens to their grievances
till they wind up by assuring him that the
“Day of Judgment is at hand,” or that
“Armageddon approaches and the Book un-
folds.” Then the new -:mqmb§r realises that
his ear has been' bitten, and he has fallen in,
and he girds up his loins and flees like the
wind.

The last nights of “The Quaker Girl” in
Sydney are announced. On Saturday week
the Sinbad mariner will oust her from the
position she has held for so long in the
hearts of Her Majesty’s patrons.
At the Criterion Theatre a Cold in the
Head gives a shower of sneezes regularly
every evening. She lives with Toothache
and other crimes in a cupboard off the
Palace of Night- “The Blue Bird” also
flutters on to the head of the Oak-soul (E.
A. Warburton), at the same address, and
hurriedly scratches his 'Tennysonian oakum
locks on the chance of prospecting a young
acorn, before flying higher through Maeter-
linck’s plot. Bread (Edward Rigby) is so
good that he can’t be any better unless he
turns into currant bun stiffened with a
backbone of candied peel. If Bluebeard,
before losing his head, had been leavened
with yeast he’d have loafed across the stage
in the turban and fixings of Edward Rigby
Bread, Esq. The Land 'of Memory gives a
capable actor, Harry Halley, as Gaffer Tyl,
a limited opportunity, but he seizes it with
a hearty grip. Pale blue spirit children
wander through “The Blue Bird’s” kingdom
of the Future, and clamor to old Time to
send them down to earth where the empty
cradle generally hangs up in the dustbin.

“The Tide of Death” is Spencer’s latest
all-Australian production, and it is now
being flicked at the Lyceum. The scenes are
local and easily recognisable, and the plot is
spread over a good deal of ground, including
a good picture of the departure of an Orient
boat from the Quay. The chief parts are
taken by Augustus Neville, as Philip Max-
well, a youpg contractor, and Lottie Ly.ell
(the leading lady in Spencer’s other local
play, “Margaret Catchpgle”), who makes a
big success qt Sylvia Grey. The acting and
mountings show an improvement on the pre-
vious pictures; plainly the Spencer co. means
to hold its own with Yankee and European

tainly improvements on most imported films,
where the actors seem to be totally unaccus-

is a gladsome centaur.

There is no mention, so far, that “The
Sins of Society,” which is now filling the
Adelplii coffers so tightly that the coin in
the back row is liable to death from suffoca-
tion, is likely to give way to “The Horrors
of Mosman,” or any other popular religious
drama. Still everything changes, and those
who want to stay away from “the Sins” had
better do so right now, lest there should one
day be no such piece to remain away from,
and then the people who postponed their
absence will recognise a. lost opportunity,
and will gnash their teeth if they were punc-
tual enough to get any, and cry out mourn-
fully with an exceeding bitter noise like the
pelican in the wilderness, saying “Too

Sarah,” and several other things, will make
her debut by proxy in Sydney at the Glaci-

now prepared “Camille,” and Wests will un-
wind the film.

Joseph Blascheck and Mildred Wrighton
are nightly drawing their share of amuse-
ment seekers to Sydney Y.M.C.A Hall. The
amusement seeker these nights is so- abun-
dant that he clamors and rages round the
doors of every show, and hangs hungrily
over box plans, searching for a square un-
marked by the fatal blue X, which indicates
that a body has booked that seat, and will
raise Cain if it is jumped. It is a curious
fact that Sydney and Melbourne folk have
usually to journey to the seashore to get
anything in the way of light or drawing-
room entertainment such as the accomplished
Blascheck-Wrighton pair provide in a high-
grade form. There should be a steady
demand for the same sparkling goods in
town, providing they are retailed in a cosy
and accessible spot.

Hayman and Franklin, dealers in Hebrew
humor, arrived at the Tivoli on Monday
night, and started again over some of the
ground covered by the voluminous Julian
Rose—the artist who used to have great
difficulty in leaving off. Other performers
provide humor of the fermented and spiritu-
ous order. Rinaldo (now in his last nights)
makes his fiddle drone and gurgle sleepily.
Fred Poplar falls about limply with his
tailor’s dummy, and wipes the stage with
his cheerfully crumpled garments; but the
dazzling Reg Wentworth, who cannot con-
ceal his satisfaction with himself, reels with
extreme care and touches the floor only with
the soles of his blinding boots and the tip
of his walking wand. Heaven only knows
what would happen if Wentworth made a
false step, and actually fell in all his finery.
Probably he is heavily insured against such
a catastrophe. The other folk on whom
honorable mention is bestowed are Tiny
Arnold, the Iveeley Brothers, comedian Tom
Dawson and the juggling Testros;
Amongst the important announcements
during the week were the following:—
The State Governor, Captain Dumaresq, Captain
de Moleyns, and Sir Thomas Lees lunched with the
Governor-General and Lady Denman at Government
House.
Ada Ward returns to the stage after 10 years’ as-
sociation with Stiggins, Snuffle and Co. “I shall,”
she said, “never be able to erase from my heart the
unkind way in which I have been treated by Chris-
tian people.”
’The Duke of Portland declared to a Wesleyan Bible
class that, since he had given up liquor, he felt a
better man in every possible way, and he really be-
lieved that he would live a few years longer.
Contrariwise, the Religious Editor has had his life
saved four mornings running with rum in a pewter.
Russia has been warned by three Maoriland papers
that its intervention in Persian affairs will not be

carols and such-like, and an army of stock
jest-mongers and sentimentalists. Small
wonder that this one-time house of stoush is
habitually packed, While the box office em-

him in the way of money-taking.

son, will not speak of the side of the show

This office is now negotiating with the Ad-
miralty for the purchase of a periscope, the
optical instrument which enables the steers-
man of a submarine to see where he is going

idea for a look-round-the-cornerscope. He
has reported that he thinks he can work it
out on two nightmares and a box of strong

In Adelaide the end of summer came
abruptly, with Easter, and the various out-
door shows that have so perfect a climate
(for them) during about five months, are
all coming in out of the cold. “Sinbad” is
still at the Royal, and Harold Ashton is
bearing up manfully under the strain of hav-
ing to turn perfectly good money away every
night. It is probably the best pantomime
within memory—even remembering “Mother
Goose”; and the idea of making Sinbad a
male, instead of a girl, is a pleasant innova-
tion. The picture houses have all been
showing the steeplechasing at Oakbank ; also
the Empire stars a fine burning ship at sea.
Wondergraph has “Romeo and Juliet”
(finely acted, but taking some liberties with
the Bard), and West’s has an Asta Nielsen
tragedy. The Tivoli has Frank Sidney’s
jumping, and some clever ■ people new to
Australia; the King’s, a Scotch Lauder, an
Irish O’Toole, and a boxing Goodwin. Also
Millie Doris continues her dark-blue career.
Hers is the most rapid event since Marie
Lloyd. Turns like this do real harm —in
the long run—to the variety business, if
managers would only recognise it.

Behold! the bellowdrama that is clothed
in gladrag and located in Bagdad, the gar-
nishings whereof are glorious as the mid-
night sunset on a silver sea, and whose
storv hath all the hues of the rainbow, not
to mention the peacock’s tail —behold ! it
reigneth at Melbourne Royal, and “Kismet”
is its name. And, by the curves of the
Almah who dances before the Caliph ! it is
a magnet to the multitude. Moreover, the
performance is not so noisy as on the first
night, for the tom-toms have taken a hint
and the wind instruments have listened to
reason. Save for this welcome modulation,
“Kismet” continues to go in the way that it
went. All things happen as they did. Hajj,
the unaccountable Beggar, having changed
his outfit and been massaged and anointed
in the local beauty parlor till he smelleth
sweeter than the honeycomb, never fails,, to
tempt the appetite of Wazir Mansur’s wife,
a matron fully lOdeg. warmer than Mrs.
Potiphar when the summer wind bloweth
from the north. Thus it comes to. pass, that
Hajj, after murdering Sheik Porter under
circumstances too dark to notice, enters the
harem of Mrs. Potiphar’s counterpart by a
conspicuously secret trapdoor, and sorely
angers the lady by having other business
than herself to attend to. Therefore she
denounces the disappointing intruder to her
lord, the Wazir, and poor Hajj is so com-
pletely in the soup that the dramatist has
to take extreme measures to extricate him.
Just as the Beggar is about to be slain by
the hand of Mansur aforesaid, that mis-
guided personage observes an amulet on the
Beggar’s left breast, and accepts the wearer
for his long lost father, whereupon his sup-
posed offspring blesses him with a knife-thrust
through his lungs and liver, and drowns him
in the harem’s swimming bath to make sure
of his decease. “Kismet,” as a rule, travels
at only walking pace. But when fully ex-
tended, its action can be swifter than the
whirlwind that sweeps the desert. If
this costly Arab steed were matched
against the fastest bit of blood-stock
from Bilanderson’s stable, for a 2-fur-
long sprint, The Bulletin would bet 10
to 1 in drachmas on Oscar Asche’s mount.
“After Dark,” at the King’s, calls for
rather sad reflections on the drama it was,
the drama it is, and the drama it ought to
be. There are so many ways of staging
gambling-hells, crowded thoroughfares, flow-
ing rivers (which are the stuffs they usually
put under bridges), boudoirs, antique music-
halls, and railway trains in furious motion.
A lot can be done with “After Dark,” and
in some previous productions of this early
father of melodrama, the sins of omission
were numerous. In the present production
they amount to a multitude. The things
thfft do happen seem to whisper hints'and
innuendoes of the things that don’t take
place. All the old effect of the underground
railway scene, which was eerie in intention
and clever in accomplishment, has been sac-
rificed to a notion of novelty. The line
runs north and south, so the vague engine
of the midnight express emerges slowly from
the background, and sticks fast in the dark-
ness, whilst Walter Baker comes from afar
off to shift the body of Herbert Bentley out
of harm’s way. And when the line is
cleared, the engine merely coughs along at, a
snail’s pace, instead of rushing into the or-
chestra and laying the conductor low. As a
matter of fact, the curtain falls and averts the
catastrophe, and the easy rescue of Bentley
by Baker is forgotten in the audience’s burst
of thanksgiving for the orchestra’s escape.
That is, if the audience takes the locomo-
tive seriously. Dicey Morris’s music-hall
is another conspicuous display of shortcom-
ings. The furnishing is as defective as the
audience, and none of the melancholy expo-
nents of a gay life are served with liquor or
cigars. Regarded even as a temperance hall,
it is lacking in ginger beer. Nevertheless,
the performance in this den of propriety is
calculated to drive a camel to drink. “The
world-famed bunch of nonsense,” supplied
by Tom Armstrong and Priscilla Verne, is a
terribly large bunch, bigger in circumference
than a bouquet of full-blown cabbages. And
the whole strength of the entertainment at

same “turn” at a Melbourne hall. The dra-
matic material in the story of “After Dark”
is not so rich that it can make light of its
trimmings. Old Tom, for instance, appears
to roost, like Diogenes, in a barrel, under
a dry arch. But when he says adieu to his
newly-discovered daughter, Frances Ross,
whom he plucked from a watery grave, he
begs her to write to him, as though the dis-
trict postman were in the habit of bringing
letters addressed to Old Tom in a Tub,
Dry Arches, Thames, London. The fore-
going remarks lead one up to the announce-
ment that the underdone villain of the piece
will be caught by his mutilated ear until

A consignment of “new English artists”
was unpacked at the Opera House last
Saturday. In the first part came Ronald
George, , a clever performer on the xylophone
and other instruments of music. In the
second part were Blake and Granby, remem-
bered as a satisfactory pair of duologue,
sketch comedians in days of yore, and re-
acceptable because their present one-actlet
comedy is pretty good of its kind. The other
new arrivals were Monie Mine and Will H.
Fox. The lady acts up to her fresh young
name. She brings an endearing personality
to bear upon the matter in hand, and talks
saucy ditties pungently. Will Fox is a
pianologist and storyteller, with a ’Murkan
accent, and the air of one who might be use-
ful in a street row. He smites the keyboard
with hands, nose and foot, and delivers his
jokes as though they were fair knock-outs.
I'ictorially, he is a symphony in brick-red, or
raw rump steak—hat, tie, sac suit and boots
being toned to concert pitch. The Athletas
are still combining strength, grace and
brawn. Burnetti, the musician imperson-
ator, continues to announce his various char-
acters in a voice which is very faded and
almost gone, and Fanny Powers and others
are also as before.

“Married to the Wrong Man,” the Mel-
villedrama at the Princess’s, is more im-
probable than a bunyip, and more banal than
any of its predecessors. All the depths and
shoals of inanity are sounded in the scene
in which the villain, finding that he has
married a woman in mistake for an heiress,
bitterly announces his willingness to dis-
pose of his wife for £l5 sterling; whereupon
the mournful young hero, who is in receipt
of the bloated salary paid by Bull to the
rank and file of his military caste, purchases
the lady. Whether Private Gladwin had
been hoarding his tobacco allowance, with
canniness aforethought, for the purpose of
buying a girl, or, having just robbed the
tdl of the regimental canteen, purchased the
feminine goods in a moment of mad extrava-
gance, is not made clear; but everybody
agrees that it was a dashed good job that he
had the coin in his pocket. Unfortunately his
noble action seems to weigh on his mind, and
f”” the remainder of the evening he wears
the expression of a man who, having found
two bad oysters in his soup, is convinced of
his resemblance to Ishmael, the son of Abra-
ham and Hagar. It must not be thought
that the 1 author puts all his good work
into this one scene. The very best part of
the play is the trial scene in the last can-
ticle. which, as a piece of burlesque, makes
the first act of “The Girl in the Train” seem
dull and lifeless by comparison. By the
way. “The Night Side of London” is about
to displace the story of the lady who was
sold for three fivers net.

In about the middle of May, another
bohemian rally will transpire at Melbourne

godfather, of up-to-date Australian drama,
is arranging an entertainment on the lines
pi his previous honorable achievements.
•Billy” is tripping to Europe for informa-
tion and. rest, and this next Australian
Drama Night at the Teutonic temple will
be his temporary farewell, so a committee
is forming itself for the purpose of ensuring
a congenial audience. Three new playlets
are comittg to light. Louis Esson produces
a dramatisation of liis story, “The Sacred

Lone Hand. . Kathleen Watson, authoress
of the “Litanies,” is programmed for “If

m a shock ; and Moore is staging “Mysteri-
ous Moonlight,” the heroine whereof is a
waitress in an hotel by the sea. The author
pji? ex Pects, will be the ardent bachelor
Willie, who comes along and secures her as
a partner for the next mixed bathe. The
note of good Australian interest is sus-
tained in the poetry and music section of the
bill, which includes two new works by local
composers.

“The Girl in the Train,” who is on view,
to a reasonable extent, at Melbourne Her
Majesty’s, is a damsel of moods. She is
by turn strenuously merry and tunefully
vivacious. The first half of her is Gilbertian
burlesque, so those who love nought but
musical comedy are advised to remain away
untd nine o’clock, or thereabouts. There is
a. paucity of musical numbers in the present
niece, but a couple of catchy ditties eventu-
ate in Act 11, as well as the skit on “Sam-
son and Delilah,” which elaborate piece of
foolery will have served a useful purpose if
it brings home to the theatregoers (as it
should do) the gaudy theatricalism of the
“uch-boomed biblical opera. Act I of “The
(iirl” is devoted to' the divorce proceedings
m which Karel Van Buren (respondent)
endeavors to convince the Court that al-
though he was locked in a sleeping car with
ilorrie Young for several hours he did not
even kiss her, whereat Judge Percy remarks
that “The young man appears to have be-
haved like a perfect ass.” Fortunately the
incident did not occur on the Weary State
railways, or, in the much longer time re-
quired to complete the journey, all kinds of
things might have transpired, with the pro-
bable result that tenor Andrews would
have lost his character. Fate was kind to
him. A tenor without a character generally
runs to beef and becomes a most reprehensi-
ble incident.

The repertoire of Margaret Cooper, the
masterful-looking charmer who is housed at
Melbourne Athenaeum, consists largely of'
rather ordinary serio-comic ditties ; but Mar-
garet herself differs- from the ordinary friv-
olous songstress in many respects ; the three
most important being (1) she sings her
songs, (2) she is a pianist in a thousand,
(3) she appears to enjoy her work. This
last is a strong suit in an age when bore-
dom is the stock in trade of the average plat-
form lady who is paid to prevent boredom
in others. The gifted Margaret uses her
mobile features with elegant artistry. Also,
she is wise in her generation in forbearing
to recount allegedly humorous stories, a
job which not more than one female in
394,762 can perform with any degree of
success. Since the advent of Miss Cooper,
the classic “Waltz me round again, Willie,”
has regained much of its pristine popularity.
Scott-Leslie, the tame humorist who sup-
ports the star, is not always as amusing as
a fat man in pursuit of. a tramcar, but as a
character-actor he commands respect. His
recital of “Don’t know, don’t care,” “the
waster’s little gospel of despair,” is en-
hanced by a most effective “make-up,” just
as his monody anent the “pore old bachelor”
is discounted by an ineffective one. But the
ole bachelor who buries his chin in his shirt
front and addresses amorous reminiscences
to the. end of his cigar is a hackneyed and
bathetic circumstance, anyhow. Next week
will be the third and last of a fruitful
season.

At Melbourne‘.Olympia, on Saturday, the
wrestl e-de-luxe between Gotch and Hacken-
schmidt was depicted in several yards of film,
which Charles Spencer bagged in the United
States. .It is a fine picture, with a moving
incident in every few feet of it, and exhibits
the famous toe-hold, in particular. Of
other attractions, the most anguished was
“A Child of the West,” in which a small kid
is exploited with awful results. The child’s
pa is about to climb a tree by his neck, on
account of horse-embezzlement, but the off-
spring pleads so effectively that the kind-
hearted murderers release the old man. And
not content with thus giving full value, they
weep into their hats by way of discount.

A beauty competition is blowing strongly
at the Melbourne Glaciarium, and the candi-
dates are .shown in all their loveliness by
means of Kinemacolor. The process depicts'
the flesh and hair tints, and the hues of
frocks, with charming effect; also it prob-
ably flatters some of the sitters. Another
Kinemacolor item shows a pompous Indian
review of British black-and-tan regiments.
The chief black-and-white feature is “Rip
\an Winkle,” a very fair local production,
mthactor Styan showing his embonpoint
as Rip.
Julius Superhumanus Knight was lately earning a
crust and a new' stock of ties as a member of a re-
pertory co. doing a seven weeks’ season at Miss:
ITorniman s Gaiety Theatre, Manchester. He was
EmZ lng . T u ? h^roie roles in a series of dramas including
The , Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith,” “Arms and the
Man,,, The Walls of Jericho,” Calderon’s “Foun-
tain, and various one-act pieces by obscure writers.
, Slapoffski, musical boss to the H. B. Irving show
during its tour through Maoriland, told a storv ta
the islanders concerning Marshall Hall. When Hall!
was Professor of Music at. Melbourne University, he 1
was sent a dreadful composition, and asked whether
a certain chord of the dominant seventh should be
written in the second or third inversion, or some-
thing of the sort. Hair wrote back as follows: “Dear
Sir, It doesn t matter a damn. Yours truly, Mar-
shall Hall.” The questioner complained to the:
Senate about the nature of the reply, and the pro-
fessor was asked for an explanation. It was duly
forwarded: “Dear Sirs,—Well, it really didn’t matter
a damn. Yours truly, Marshall Hall.”
“C. Oclcney”: Margaret Anglin, good actress as
all Australian playgoers know her to be, cannot
seemingly procure “the goods” in the way of a play
to suit her. By latest advices she has tired of her
new Henry Arthur Jones .drama, “Lydia Gilmore”
(probably for reasons not unconnected with the box
office), and has once again put on “Green Stockings.”
The latter play is a new version, for which the rare,
pale Margaret is herself partly responsible, of A. E.
W. Mason’s comedy, “Colonel Smith,” which failed
when produced ,at London St. James’s three seasons:
ago. Henry Author Jones is presumably also getting
tired of writing new plays (also for reasons not en-
tirely unconnected, etc.), for his name once more
bobs up on the London music-hall bills in connection
with a sketch for Seymour Hicks, this time a con-
densed version of his old success, “The Middleman,”
seen in these parts many moons agone.
AT POVERTY POINT.
“AFTER DARK," AT
MELBOURNE KING'S.
Lucy , the wife, wanders
into the bitter world.
Edwin Campbell as
Dicey Morris.
Walter Baker as
Old Tom at home,
Brennan’s Amphitheatre is a bright new link in
the Bourke-street chain of Melbourne show-houses.
The chain starts with J. D. Williams’s picture theatre
—the Melba —near Cole’s Book Arcade, and ends at
the Princess’s, which counts as a Bourke-street
theatre, though it is off the main thoroughfare, like
the King’s in Russell-street and Her Majesty’s in
Exhibition-street. They are all served by the same
tram-line. In Bourke-street itself there are now the
Melba, the Opera House and the Bijou (dedicated to
pictures these times) on the south side, and Hoyt’s,
the Royal, the Waxworks (changed in name and
character), and Brennan’s just opened amphitheatre
•on the north side. This new attraction, pitched be-
tween Exhibition and Spring Streets, will certainly
ihelp to increase the flow; of patronage towards the
Princess’s, which for many years suffered from isola-
tion. The Royal, the .Opera House and the Bijou
(when it was a comedy theatre) constituted a market,
and people dropped casually into either place because
they were within a brick’s throw of one another.
The Princess’s being then more than a quarter of a
mile from any theatre, bar the old Alexandra (which
was often closed, and never fashionable until William-
son converted it into Her Majesty’s) got no acci-
dental customers at all in an ordinary way. To-day
the longest link in the chain stretches from the
King’s in Russell-street, to Her Majesty’s in Exhibi-
tion-street. The cross streets are a furlong apart,
on the tram route, and any spot .between them on
either side of Bourke-street will be a good site for
another theatre when Melbourne wgnts one. Mean-
while, Melbourne had better wait until it is bigger
and richer, and its tram service has changed the
slow underground cable of Private Monopoly for
municipal electrification.
“Screen”: Rip Van Winkle is biographed in Mel-
bourne excellently, by an Australian company, with
Styan as Winkle. Probably the foundation of the
idea was found in the Sleeping Beauty, though she
doesn’t grow old; or, maybe, the Seven Sleepers of
Ephesus had something to do with it. Washington
Irving found the legend among the Dutchmen. Vari-
ous Rip dramas were put together before Jefferson’s
time. Ilackett excelled as the Dutch slumberer, and
so did Burke, Jefferson’s cousin. Jefferson made no
impression in it at first. He re-constructed the piece,
and it began to catch on. What a success he made in
Sydney and Melbourne! Manager Tolano was mis-
taken, exactly like Coppin over Williamson about 12
years later. Good imitators of Jefferson were J. L.
Hall and H. R. Roberts’s father. Wijliamson’s Rip
was different. In London Jefferson had the piece en-
tirely re-written by Boucieault. He was within an
ace of being baulked of an appearance, through the
animosity of Boucieault and Manager Webster, at the
Adelphi.
Perhaps you have some special engagement, have
a headache and afraid to go. You needn’t be. Stearns’
Headache Cure makes the going possible.*
“Snell”: The chief grievance I have against “Kis-
met,” as deeorated by Oscar Asche, is its too frequent
parades. Wazirs, caliphs, and other grandees of rich
old Bagdad move around the winding streets, pre-
ceded and followed by stately processions that scam-
per like the Dead March in “Saul.” In fact, they
usually contain bunches of dancing girls, who stop
every three paces to cast attitudes like the hierogly-
phics on a Babylonian brick, with the result that
about one hour out. of the three consumed by “Kis-
met,” is devoted to the spectacle of an ancient Arab
solemnly taking the air, with half a mile of gaudy
retinue stringing after him. lam no f, sure “Kismet”
should not rank as a living picture rather than a
drama.
“Harrison O.” : The ancient notion that it is rank
sacrilege for an ordinary theatrical performance to
eventuate on Good Friday, is about due to explode—-
in Melbourne, anyhow. Last year Harry Rickards
gave the convention a jolt by providing vaude-
ville performances, both in the afternoon and even-
ing of Good Friday. The splosh that cheers jingled
into the box office, with the result that it is now
the settled policy of the Opera House to regard Good
Friday as an ordinary holiday. At the Melbourne
Princess’s this year the programme of a semi-sacred
concert included several serio-comic ditties, and a
turn consisting of monologues, funny stories, etc., by
Phyllis Hopwood-Foldi. The affair was most suc-
cessful; whereas a show at the King’s that made a
genuine attempt at being sacred was received with
vociferous absence. In the suburbs the eternal “pit-
chers” flourished, and at St. Kilda the merry-go-round
and Figure Eight did good business. The last two
appealed to me as particularly worthy of sup-
port, since they put forward no fraudulent appeal
for semi-religious patronage. The ancient hypocrisy
of providing pseudo-sacred entertainments on Good
Friday night will probably die hard, but I prophesy
that, within the next year or two, the word “sacred”
will be made to cover a multitude of histrionic sins,
such as “The Most Horrible Female in Jerusalem,”
which will probably prove a tremendous draw;
especially if the heroine, when bound to a table in
the ruined mill, which the horrible one has set on
fire, warbles “The Holy City” while waiting for the
hero to come to her rescue.
The coming J. C. Williamson revival of “Ben Hur”
may have been suggested by talk of revivals of that
10-year-old sensation in America and England—as the
result of the “Kismet” success. The solemn spec-
tacular drama, with the chariot race in it, was to
be staged at Drury Lane last week. Australia re-
members it as the great show that had run for only
a week or two at Her Majesty’s, Sydney, when the
theatre was burnt out.
“Monlcbarns”: A leading Melbourne paper says
that “After Dark” was first produced there by Rig-
nold, 20 years ago. Not so. It was first produced
in Melbourne over 40 years ago, at the Royal, under
the management of Lambert, C. Vincent, Bellair,
Harwood, Stewart and Hennings. These six took
over the Royal after it was yielded up by Hoskins and
Clarence Holt (Bland’s dad). They opened with
“The Serf,” and their two great successes were
“Flying Scud” and “After Dark,” in which C. Vin-
cent played Old Tom. Not to be confounded with
11. H. Vincent, who came later. C. Vincent, right
name Vyner, died in Melbourne. Husband of Louisa
Cleveland, who afterwards married Stirling, in Lon-
don. She was one of Melbourne’s four lady Hamlets
—Cleveland, Pomeroy, Rose Evans and Mrs. G. B.
W. Lewis. Vincent and Miss Cleveland made their
first Melbourne appearance under Barry Sullivan, in
“Leah, the Forsaken.” There was never an Aus-
tralian cast of “The Hunchback” to equal that which
included Sullivan, Heir, Lambert, Vincent, C. Young,
Stewart, Miss Cleveland and Mrs. Heir. The rail-
way sensation in “After Dark” was stolen from
Augustin Daly’s “Under the Gaslight.”
Veteran “Johnny” Wallace, who gets only an oc-
casional job as stage-manager in Melbourne these
times, must have a store of reminiscences of the late
Emily Soldene. “Johnny” could place her age to
within a year or two of the solemn, truth. He was
one of the two gendarmes in “G6nevi6ve de Brabant”
when Soldene was the co.’s leading lady—the gen-
darmes, by the way, helping considerably to give
the opera its vogue.
At London’s underground theatre, the Criterion,
which, like the overground restaurant on the top of
it, belongs to Spiers and Pond, once of Melbourne,
Robert Loraine has produced a peculiar sort of farci-
cal comedy, mysteriously labelled “98.9.” Robert
is the actor-aeronaut who was once going to marry
our own Marie Lohr, but the fair lady chucked him
because he would not promise to cease from flying.
In this numerically-entitled play Robert arrives in
an aeroplane—not actually on the stage, but the
audience, by means of clever mechanical devices be-
hind the scene, hears the aeroplane in remarkably
realistic fachion. The cinematograph is also intro-
duced to depict the movements of the heroine from
the time she left her home to her arrival at a London
railway station. The explanation of the figures that
form the title is that the hero takes the heroine’s
temperature after a love scene, and finds that it is
98.9—half a degree above the normal—a somewhat
slender foundation on which to christen a comedy.
After the marriage has been arranged the hero shows
his girl over their future home, especially the nursery,
which displays on its walls such choice inscriptions
as “Increase and Multiply,” “The More the Merrier,”
and, so on, A rather broad ’and tasteless joke, but
London is getting accustomed to that sort of Rabe-
laisian humor. Australian managers are not likely
to tumble over each other in their anxiety to secure
“98.9.”
“Circle” : The music-hall artist of the hilarious order
occasionally goes back on his confiding audience, and
hands out, instead of the looked-for frivolity, an
item of the viciously sorrowful order —some crape-
draped item, which is about as cheerful as a bank-
rupt widow with 10 small children and a squint. It
is usually prefaced with a speech something like
this: “Ladies an’ Gentl’m’n, —Jus’ to show you I
can be serious sometimes, I’ll now recite, with your
kind attention, a little poem entitled ‘All Together.’ ”
The audience thinks a jest is to be sprung on it,
and grins steadily, until the red-nosed shock in the
bright green suit is almost through. Then it realises
with dismay that the baby really is dead
and the wife is dead; also that the hus-
band is genuinely dying of consumption, and
will soon be as dead as either. By the time he nails
home the point that the family will soon be “All
Together” in the grave, the theatregoers feel
ashamed of their suppressed merriment, and try to
make it up by applauding the gruesome outbreak.
What makes comedians play these confidence tricks?
These are the days when the daily newspaper ap-
plies stout and heroic language to all sorts of absurd
exploits, and small transactions of the bowler hat
and brown bag variety. Any furtive gathering or
boil-over of obscure parsons in a back room is liable
to be called “a crusade,” while a politician of the
beetle species, on his hind legs, can’t escape being
dubbed “the lion in the path.” A week or so back,
a shareholder in a venture which deals in red-nosed
comedians, trained apes and such things, wrote plain-
tively to his favorite morning sheet about the man-
agement of the concern, and was sternly reprimanded
in the commercial column for listening to “the
poisonous mutterings” of something or other. It was
a fine phrase, with a flavor of conspiracy and horror
about it.
“E.W.”: Carrie Moore, in charge of husband Big-
wood, took ship at Sydney last week for Auckland.
She is on her way to Rotorua, where she hopes to
get rid of an attack of nerves which put her out of
the London limelight in the middle of a lucrative
engagement. The voyage out to Australia did her a
lot of good, and the Maoriland springs are ex-
pected to complete the cure.

WHO NOSE ?
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Endless .vistas of possibility are opened up by a
medical man’s suggestion, that the sense of smell
ought to be cultivated, as the senses of sight and
hearing are cultivated.— Melbourne paper.
Greater knowledge ought to dwell
In our human sense of smell.
By the instinct of our nose
We should spot our friends or foes :
Sniff a footpad lurking near,
Ere his shadow did appear ;
Know a cruel girl or kind
By the perfume of her mind.
Curate smug or lawyer’s clerk
Should be scented in the dark.
When a Tory friend of Fat
• Poses as a democrat,
With a keen, inquiring snout,
Blindfold, we should find him out.
Though a lot of odors mix
In the House of Politics,.
Never should we need to look
Ere detecting Joseph Cook.
Let us train our noses all—
Jewish beaks or noses small—
In the subtle art of smell;
Train them hard and train them well,
So that each, in age or youth,
May detect the breath of Truth.
Nowadays with faith sincere
We repeat the fibs we hear.
Foolishly inclined are we
To be gulled by what we see,
Though the maxim oft is told,
“All that glitters is not gold,”
Still we find in Beauty’s face
Proofs of innocence and grace.
But another day shall come
When, though blind and deaf and dumb,
Right from Wrong we'll surely tell
By our common sense of Smell.

“D.”: One of the amusing things of life
is to watch a Tory journal gradually acquir-
ing sgnse, slowly growing to realise that its
Menaces and Tigers and things are about as
dangerous as glow worms. For example, the
other day, I came across a copy of the Syd-
ney Telegraph dated March 7th, 1883. An
article dealt with the present leader of the
Irish qparty, who was out here at the time
on a similar mission to that which his son
has been conducting, amid general acclama-
tion, in Sydney and elsewhere of late. After
referring heatedly to “Mr. Redmond and his
brutal following,” the paper went on; —
It is evident that Mr. Redmond is, regarded in his
true light, a public enemy, a disturber of the peace,
n breeder of strife and faction and a dangerous advo-
cate of rebellion, if not bloodshed. The sooner we
are rid of such men as this the better. . .There is law
and order and decency on the one side —the riff-raff
on the other.
It reads quite like one of the same journal’s
sensational philippics against the Sosli peril
in 1906 —the Horror that was going to till
the land with Anarchy and ruined Homes
and burst marriage-ties if it wasn’t immedi-
ately and for ever scotched. Sosh has been
with us, both in the Australian Parliament
and in most of the State Assemblies, for
years, and Anarchy hasn’t transpired. Home
Rule appears a certainty in the near future,
and the best brains of the Empire are now
agreed that it is not going to do any particu-
lar damage to the cause of law and order.
But, unheeding these things, journals of the
Telegraph's class tirelessly continue their
hunt for fresh Horrors. A Tory paper with-
out at least - one large gore-smeared and
wholly bogus Menace about the premises
would feel Lost. #
It is a notable fact that pretty well all
the splurging “imperialistic” moves inau-
gurated hefeabouts, by shrewdly self-adver-
tising or hopelessly intoxicated or merely
foolish citizens, peter out ultimately in an
atmosphere of snarling unpleasantness, and
muddle, and wild cries for Government help,
and sordid recriminations when that help
isn’t immediately forthcyming, and all-round
squalor. The latest to traverse the custom-
ary old route is the N.S.W. Coronation Con-
tingent scheme. This was a palpably danir
phoolish venture at the best —that is to
say, even if sufficient cash had been sub-
scribed to finance it. Of Course, the requisite
cash wasn’t forthcoming. It never is in
these cases. The lads started off with some-
thing the same proportion to the sum they
should have had as the completed Dread-
nought fund stood in towards the actual
cost of a Dreadnought. During a consider-
able part of the trip, their lot resembled
that of the remittancer who is trying to lead
the alcoliblic life on four sovereigns per
month. They got back to Sydney somehow
—though not till the bewildered McGow-en
and his colleagues had been cursed by several
enraged aldermen as a set of niggardly and
unpatriotic lrbunds who would see tlieir
gallant young fellow-Walers stranded in a
strange land ere they would raise a cheque-
book, etc., etc. —and a general inclination
became apparent to bury the affair among
the errors of the past. However, it has de-
clined to stay buried. It now appears that
the boys’ passages from London to Sydney
were never, paid for, and that the shipping
co. which had the privilege of carrying them
is issuing writs for the money. Of course,
as usual, the State will have to pay up for
a luxury which it didn’t want, and a bill
which it authorised nobody to incur. A
depressing 'feature of the ridiculous busi-
ness is the certainty that it won’t even act
as an example to choke Private Enterprise
off similar idiocies in the future.
A few Brighton (Vic.) residents are
rightly, but not too strenuously, protesting
against the Railway Commissioners’ ex-
pressed intention to call the new station in
that vicinity Rippon Lea, after tile late
Sargood’s residence. Brighton district is
singularly afflicted with second-hand re-
minders of Cold Country bank-holiday re-
sorts, and when a new name has been built
it has been either inappropriate or meaning-
less. The result of the late lamentable
Tait’s cogitation was “Garden Vale” (the
station is a high, straddling, grasshoppery
contraption, on trestles, in the middle of an
unoccupied, waterlogged claypan), and the
bourgeois “Bentleigh” (a long way from
the scenes of the late Bent’s endeavors and
blunders). The older names do even less
credit to their sponsors—Brighton, Hamp-
ton, Sandringham, Cheltenham, Men rone
and so on. And all are duplicated or mul-
tiplicated elsewhere in the Commonwealth.
A case before the Maoriland courts just
now has shed quite an illuminating light
upon the gentle land agent in the country
where the mortgage flourisheth. Briefly,
8000 acres in Taranaki were bought at
6s. 6d. per acre. No improvements were made,
but, within 12 months, the area was sold
again at 12s. 6d. No cash changed hands,
the purchase ; money remaining on mortgage.
A few slight improvements were then made,
and. within another 12 months, a buyer at
£3 10s. was found. He took over the mort-
gage and gave an improved farm of 1200
acres in part payment, but he suddenly took
fright and refused to complete the bargain.
It was to force him through with it that the
Law was invited to butt in. Under cross-
examination one agent delivered a policy
speech on behalf of the craft: —
It was to an agent’s advantage to act in collusion
with an agent on the other side. This was frequently
done, as by pooling the agent would get far more
commission than if he got a commission from only his
own client. Agents never considered it their duty
to let their principals know that commission was
being pooled.
The Court was breathing heavily through
its horsehair when last heard from.
THE ABSENT ARE ALWAYS WRONG.
HE : “Well, I suppose the Sewing Guild went through a lot of gossip this afternoon.”
SHE : “No, it did not.”
HE: “Well, why is this? ”
SHE : “Y ou see every member was present.”
The chief use of a Melbourne policeman is
to be “completely in the dark.” When he
isn’t in the dark he is “completely at a
loss.” The papers never seem to invent any
fresh phrases to describe the chronically un-
lighted condition or. intellectual bankruptcy
of O’Callaghan’s legions. People who have
been robbed call them in listlessly, and tell
them all about it because they (the alleged
“force”) might otherwise feel slighted, and
go away and die of ingrpwing and suspicious
toenail. “It does no harm to ,let the police
know,” about represents the sentiments of
the average victim. A fair sample of thp
“perplexing problems” they aie given to
grapple with was revealed last week by a
casual outsider, who noticed a group of blokes
in a lane catching parcels aud boxes, which
were being dropped to them from the second
storey window of a drapery store. The .spec-
tator’s suspicions were aroused by the fact
that the delivery work was being done at
dusk on Sunday. He awoke the police, and
the police rushed down and arrested some
empty boxes. The thieves had elevated one
of their number (possibly with the rungs of
a ladder) to the window, the catch of which
he had pushed back, prior to opening it, and
crawling in. The goods were conveyed to the
ground by gravitation—a natural force well-
known to criminals. The daring spirits who
evolved the intricate plan were caught next
day—by Melbourne police. They deserved
their fate.
Adelaide Police Court has decided, rather
surprisingly, that it is not “Language with
intent to provoke a breach of the peace
unless (apparently) the blow can follow on
the word. In this case, the Language was
there all right, but the Intent was held to
be missing, because the speaker was driving
a cab past, and in an opposite direction to,
the dray holding the man he talked at. So
what you may say seems to depend pretty
much on how fast you can run ; and the man
in a swift motor-car may call you a cow or
an angel without reproof from the law ; and
the aeroplanist can say simply Anything.
You can breach the peace with him when he
comes down, just in the old sweet way, but
then he may not come down within your
reach.
THE ROAD TO RUIN.
The publication of the fact that several youthful
applicants had been rejected as unfit for military
training on account of - impaired Health, caused
through cigarette-smoking, has directed attention to
the question of juvenile smoking. Dr. Ashburton
Thompson, president of the Board of Health, stated
recently that... it would be an excellent thing for the
State to make a law entirely prohibiting boys from
smoking. Already too great a proportion of the
rising generation was affected by cigarette-smoking.

THE CONSTITUTION.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Is the Commonwealth Constitution to stand, or is
it to be the sport of party? Are we as a people
to observe the compact so solemnly made a litcle
over 10 years ago, or are the States to be under-
mined and. obliterated? —Spasm from a recent S. M.
Herald Leader.
Will it be the sport of Party,
And his Socialistic Nibs?
Will they punch it good and hearty
In the region of the ribs?
Will they break, and will they batter
Its physique from head to feet,
Till the flying fragments clatter
On the surface of the street?
Will they bowl it at the batsmen?
Will they smite it to the fence?
Will Dill Macky’s men and Pat’s men
Catch it out with diligence?
Will the racing forwards kick it
Through a thousand waiting goals?
Will the golfers wildly stick it
Into damp and dismal holes ?
Will the fiends invoke the thunder
Of the blaring party drum?
Will they cut the ground from under?
Will they hoist it out of plumb?
Will they pierce this Constitution
With a million poisoned darts,
When the blood-flecked revolution
On its jamboreeing starts?
Will it be obliterated
From the Map of Current Things?
Will its clothes be confiscated
When the watching Tiger springs?
Will it leave no signs behind it,
On that day of dark disgrace,
When the ghouls have undermined it,
Save a leering, vacant place?
There are scores of lurking dangers
Lying ambushed by the track;
The garrotters and bushrangers
Are behind it in a pack....
Does it count a semi-colon,
When the worst is said and done? —
If the Constitution’s stolen —-
Well, we’ll build a better one !

“F.C.”: The innocence of those Westralian
.Judges concerning that futile pick-me-up,
■'Barmaid’s Blush,” amuses me. It is an
evanescent, fictitious reviver, but it is well
enough known. In the days when I
used to drop into the private bars —when I
didn’t have to eat a clove or caehou before I
ambled home —we scorned to waste our thirsts
on “barmaid’s blushes,” which are mostly
beer and raspberry, things without bite or
life, .stale and Hatulapt. Now on Saturday
evening, in these degenerate days, if you
want to trot round and see Polly and Dolly
and Gwen and the rest, the habit is to stick
to something light. Seltzer and syrup—
there are about 200 different syrups, though
hot one hotel in a hundred keeps a tenth of
them—-is common. Or you can try the baby
glasses of liqueurs with a dash of soda
after, hot with, them. As for mixed drinks,
Camille and Morning Glory are good, and
Djin Djin—gin and ginger—is satisfying.
For a nice evening refresher you can’t beat
Creme de Noyeau with 30 drops of cognac
or Kiimmel and a tot of soda—that beats
fizz. The gaudiekt tanglefoot on earth is
honeymead and soda —that golden glory
with the sparkle of bright eyes, and the
rapture of hungry kisses. But you can’t
get honeymead everywhere, worse luck. As
for “Barmaid’s Blush” —the man who calls
that a drink is on a level with the steady
soaker, >yfio confined himself to beer and
brdndy mixed, on the principle that if he
cjrank all beer he was full before he was
drunk, and if he stuck to brandy he was
drtlfak before he was full. He desired the
two joys simultaneously.
THE
MYSTERY.
WILLIE (bless his little heart): “ What I can't
make out is where you two was before I got
you.”
Another sawn-off, inconclusive mystery of
a motor-car happened in Melbourne on or
about Good Friday. This time the narrative
concerns a shop-assistant, who rushed into
Albert Park police station at 4 a.m., and
earnestly demanded that the whole force turn
out and scour the city for a pale-green car,
containing two men, who had violently as-
saulted him, leaving him half dead, or there-
abouts. He said he had been placidly peram-
bulating Bourke-street the previous evening,
when a pair of courteous strangers surged up
alongside in a car, and desired him to get in
and be driven about. He got in, and they
honked him out towards Brunswick, returning
to the city about midnight. (It seems to
have been a gradual motor, but possibly it
had to be refreshed several times on the
trip.) In Flinders-street the party stopped
and “an altercation ensued” —cause not
stated, but probably due to the difficulty of
obtaining further refreshers—until an impati-
ent constable ordered the trio to get a move
on. Soon after starting a “couple of young
ladies boarded the car,” which then pro-
ceeded towards St. Kilda, as far as Canter-
bury-road—a dismal, badly-lighted thorough-
fare near the park. Here the ladies left the
car, which seems to have been a wonderfully
free-and-easy sort of conveyance, but when
the salesman also alighted, the kindly motor-
ists, who, presumably, wished to keep on driv-
ing him abound till the Home Rule Bill was
oassed. or the cows came home, got annoved
and fell on him with much slaughter, so that
he remained, “asleep or unconscious,” for the
space of three hours. It is an untidy yarn,
and though O’Callaghan laid two of his
sleuths on the job, and they went out baying
violently, they don’t seem to have been able
to interest themselves in it, somehow.
Hobart’s old batteries, which have long
passed from the sphere of defence into that,
of historic relicdom, have come under the
meditative ejfe of authority, and it is pro-
posed that the one on the Domain shall be
handed over by the Commonwealth to the
City Council. The Mulgrave Battery at
Battering Point dates back to 1823, and in
the days of its youth and importance kept
guard over the harbor lest escaped convicts
or dther unbridled ruffians should seize one
of the vessels and get safely away with her,
as happened more than once in the dashed
bad old days. The Domain Battery, which
has been at least 70 years on the spot, is
fitted with a curious old oven for making
shot red hot before hurling it at the enemy
—a popular device in the days of one Nel-
son.
Between 1906 and 1911 the Maoriland
Unitarians increased their flock by 66 per
cent., the next biggest increase, according to
the census figures, being credited to “Object
to State” with 47 per cent. It isn’t quite
clear what the exact:
rites of the Object to
State sect are, but they
are understood to in-
clude whisky and soda,
surf-bathing lawn-
mowing, we ek-end
girls, sly-grogging and
other more or less
healthy exercises. “Un-
specified” runs third,
with an increase of 28
per cent., and it, too,
is suspected of heathen
practices. After that
comes a long, strag-
gling procession of
monkey shaves, blue
spectacles, jolly-a nd-
fats, Jerusalem ab-
sentees, Buddhists,
idolators, Salt Lake
citizens, Pongs, sweat-
ers, Flossies, publicans
and other sinners. In
the five vears the
Church of England ad-
herents increased and
multiplied by 12 per
cent., Presbyterians by
15 per cent., Baptists
by 12 per cent.. Con-
gregationalists by 18
per cent., Hebrews by
13 per cent., R.C.’s by
10 per cent., Luther-
ans by 7 per cent.,
Methodists by 6 per
cent., and Buddhists,
Confucians, etc., by a
miserable 3 per cent.,
which is hardly
enough to keep the
Joss from throwing in
the towel.
“Melb ” writes: —
The Victorian Government has bought back for
£17,000, the mansion and little park of the Grange,-
St. Itilda-road, associated with Boombustus Fink. This
settles a public .delusion that the place had all along be-
longed to Government. It was .sold in 1871, but with a
stipulation that it was never to be cut up, for Run-
emup of the villas. The purchaser did not mind this,
having a mistaken idea that there would always be
an aristocratic tenant. Except with Lord Fink, this
has hardly ever been realised. Consequently, the
Grange degenerated into a dodging house. Last year
the proprietary set afoot legal proceedings to have
the Non-Cut-up proviso set aside, on the ground that
it was ultra vires, and illegal. Rather nice point, in-
asmuch as there are certain stipulations impossible in
contracts, and voidable at Equity, as shown by the
valuable Adelaide Da Costa property, lately referred
to in this paper. However, the Victorian Govern-
ment challenged the proprietary to come on, which it
didn’t, but might have, had not the conflagration
providentially come in. The Grange estate will be-
swallowed up once more' in the Government House
domain. Apparently this involves the Observatory
supplemental residential quarters going, too. Other-
wise there cannot be continuity between the Domaint
and the Grange.
“Lex,” who didn’t want the billet himself
having a more congenial job on hand: —
The more or less honorable company of Judges’
associates, received the news (12/4/’l2), that High
Court Justice Isaacs had appointed his daughter to
be his associate, with sentiments of profound appre-
hension. The Law generally regards the innova-
tion as the thin end of the wedge, and inquires help-
lessly, vaguely, where this sort of thing is to stop,
what it means and whither it is leading ? As a
matter of fact, the presence of a lady-associate in
court is fraught with embarrassing possibilities, and
on the tours, which the Judges are forever making,
she will be as out of place, almost, as a Wimmen’s
Leaguer in a club smoking-room, what time the
waiter is entering with the 14th round of alcoholic
stimulus. In the past the associates have been in
the habit of travelling together, smoking together,
dining, wining, entertaining the lady members of
the J. C. Williamson cos. in common, and so forth
and so on. What is to happen if the lady-associate
becomes a general feature of the legal landscape?
However, a cheery feature of the business, from the
standpoint of the retiring male, is that it is unlikely
to be widely imitated. The job of associating for
a Judge, like that of valeting a duke or A.D.C.-ing
a Governor, is unsuited to a female. The routine Court
duties^—the taking of' notes, handling of exhibits
and the like —are easy enough. But the associate
has other uses. He stands as a sort of buffer be-
tween his chief and the legal profession. He must,
know how to stall off the pertinacious, and smooth
down the irritated (mostly a question of adjourning
to the nearest pub in both cases), with the object
■of protecting the Judge from worry or boredom.
He books rooms, enquires about the quality of the
liquor at the various hostelries that have to be
patronised, looks after the luggage, curses dilatory
servitors —does a thousand essential things that no
lady could so much as attempt. No ; the
feminine associate has not come to stay. She is
evanescent, in the nature of her, like hobble-skirts,
paper-bag cookery, anti-Socialism, etc.

At Liverpool, England, a couple of elderly
maiden ladies have been ordered by a magis-
trate to “abate a nuisance.” They dwelt or
crazed in a handsome residence called Vinery
House. When the inspector visited the place
he found it inhabited by the two ladies, 60
pigs and a thousand other assorted animals
and birds. Twenty of the pigs resided in
the drawing-room and the dining-room, and
the bedrooms were crowded with rabbits and
pigeons. The smell, he said, was abomin-
able, but the elderly maidens regarded him
with the sniff of incredulity, and refused to
Icnow that there was any fragrance on the
premises. Apparently they were smell blind.

'J'HE dowager sat in a crowded train,

And she talked to a friend in a dismal strain
Of the death she'd died, all hut;
Of the horrible cold that choked her chest,
And the cold-cures, really none!
And the doors were shut, both east and west,
And the windows every one.
“I caught a cold hoorooslitterday,”
She said, “in a draught, you know,
With the windotvs open, hooroosh, the way
To bring on a rooslita — oh,

And the train swayed to and fro,
And sure she did look extremely crook —
And the windows shut, I trow!
The dowager sat in the crowded train,
As we racketed out from town ;
Her feet ivere large and her face was plain,
And she sneezed, with the windows down —

The hunch who weep cold tears, and wail,
With the windows closed, “Hooroosh!”

“Henry Horsecollar”: The Scott Antarc-
tic expedition is notable in at least one respect. It
presents the only case I ever heard of when horses
were in danger of being- attacked and eaten by
whales. Of course that sort of thing may have hap-
pened before. Many, many bushels of aeons ago the
whale is said to have been a lumbering and rather
helpless land animal, which was chased into the sea
by armor-clad enemies. Also, man is said to have
been a creature of the warm shallow coastal waters
—a sort of wader—before unknown circumstances—
possibly overcrowding through the arrival of the
whale —made him flee ashore and take to the tree-
tops and grow a tail. And in those times the eohippus,
which hadn’t yet become a horse, was a sort of hoofed
rabbit, and probably lived in holes. So there may
have been strange meetings in days of old. But
nowadays the horse and the whale seldom hold con-
verse.

The skipper of Mawson’s South Polar ex-
pedition ship Aurora, which arrived in Port Jackson
last week, brings the stale news that there are vast
numbers of “right” whales in the Antarctic seas.
As a matter of fact, this was not overwhelming
news 30 years ago. One other statement Captain
Davis made requires contradiction. This was to the
effect that the finbacks of the Ross Sea are of no
account. If he had made some inquiries he would
have discovered that the problem of dealing with the
once despised and dangerous finback was solved by
the Norwegians more than two years ago. If the
truth must be told—and occasionally there is no
escape—six local companies are at the present time
pursuing finbacks and bottle-noses on Norway’s coast
line. The Aurora’s skipper is very mysterious as
to the exact whereabouts of the herds of “right”
whales, but unless he has got them staked in and
branded, he will find that they are common pro-
perty. Unfortunately, Australians do not seem to
recognise this, despite the fact that the whalebone
of the “right” whale is now bringing over £3OOO
per ton. And even the short baleen plates of the fin-
back are worth £9OO per ton.
“N. or M.”: Macquarie Island, Tas-
mania’s small frozen dependency, where the wireless
and a detachment of Mawson’s expedition are located,
is a treeless expanse, tussocky and mossed over in
spots, and suitably situated as a jumping-off place
for the Antarctic. The British Government, having
handed it over to the care of the Apple Island, for-
got all about it and made it a present to Maoriland,
which necessitated explanations. The place was
formerly of interest to scientists and moralists, as the
only home of a peculiar species of ground parrot
which had degenerated and become wingless; but
cats, left upon the island by some passing ship, de-
voured them. The island is a penguin rookery, and
the birds nest there by hundreds of thousands, for
the benefit of lessee Hatch, of Maoriland, who boils
them down for oil.

“Te Babarantiko,” from a strayed island:
At the present moment a land deal, of which
perhaps not 50 men know anything at all requires a
little publicity. It relates to the selling of phos-
phate lands by the Ocean Islanders, in the Central
Pacific, to the Pacific Phosphate Co., Ltd., of
London and Melbourne, and also of Germany and
France. Some thirteen years ago phosphate of
lime was discovered on Ocean Island, and it is now
known that the whole of the island is composed
entirely of this valuable product. A charter was
obtained to work this deposit for £50,000, I mean
£5O, per annum. In the beginning things went
like a heavenly dream. The simple brown islanders
were quite content to take a 400 gal. iron tank, or a
few mats of rice or tins of biscuits or other trifles in
trade goods, as payment for a piece of land yielding
perhaps, a profit of £lOO,OOO. But as the large
steamers carried his island away, leaving in place
of his palm and pandanus-clad land an unsightly
white scar of coral pinnacles, on which nothing useful
is ever likely to grow again, the simplq islander
began to think. One day not very long ago he
definitely refused to sell. Official , correspondence
followed, wires were pulled, and public meetings
were called to discuss the matter with the people.
In vain. They argued thus: “The white people
have money, ships, etc., etc., but we have just our
land, nothing else. Our lands are disappearing;
what shall we do when they are all gone? fVe will
sell no more.” There the position hangs at present,
though, of course, the P.P.C. is moving Heaven and
earth and other portables in Britain, to get the lands
away from the natives. There has been some talk
that the little atoll, Kuria, in the Gilbert Group,
should be bought, and the Ocean Islanders trans-
planted thither; but the atoll is too small, and it
is hardly likely the islanders will go. At the same
time it is not conceivable that about 450 natives
can be permitted to stop the export of a product of
such immense value to millions of people all over
the world, and which is of no immediate use to
the native. This is my solution: Set apart an area
of the most suitable and best Crown lands in the
British Solomon Islands, to be paid for by the
scandalously wealthy co. at fair rates, and handed to
the Ocean Islanders. The natives should not be com-
pelled to immigrate right away, though some of the
younger people should reside on the land for a
stated length of time, with permission to return to
Ocean Island at intervals. As long as the people
could live comfortably on Ocean Island, which would
be for two generations, at a low estimate, they
should have the option of remaining; but on the
understanding that they must leave when the ad-
vance of mining makes removal necessary. By then
the people would have become reconciled to the idea
of leaving. A fair royalty, fixed by Act of Parlia-
ment, should be paid to the people until the island
is worked out. Also, if possible, the co. should be
compelled to pay the Crown a fair rent instead of
the £5O per annum.

“S.S.S.”: Haunted Island, in Torres
Strait, has such a bad name that neither natives nor
whites will call there. Its name supplies thg reason,
and the reason has existed since 40 years ago, when
a French refugee scattered his brains upon the
scenery. A man I know, while sailing in his cutter
from Daru to Thursday Island, picked up Haunted
and decided to go ashore for some shooting. Soon
after he landed a squall blew up, and to save the
cutter from the submerged reefs, his brown sailors
put out into the Strait and were unable to get back
to the island until nearly dawn next day. When
they, in fear and trembling, searched for their
master, they found him wandering up and down the
little beach on the other side of the island, delirious.
This is how he tells the story: —
I went and had a look at the hut in
the plantation and found it empty. Then
I walked about the scrub and got a couple
of Torres Strait pigeons. By that time
the squall came up, and I knew old Myba
would take no chances with the cutter,
so I returned to the hut and made a fire
in the lower room to smoke out the mos-
quitoes, and then climbed into the upper
room to have a sleep. ,1 waked in a cold
sweat, with my hair standing on end.
That’s how it fplt, anyhow. The moon
shone into the room and was as bright as
day. I jumped up and went outside. As
I looked along the track to see if my
boat was about, I saw a canoe come up
to the beach and two natives get out of
it. One was a gigantic man and walked
with great strides; the other was short
and thickset. I didn’t like the look of
them, and, as they strode towards the
hut I got behind a tree. As they passed
me I felt a cold wind that made me
shiver. They went into the hut, and soon
after I heard a scuffle, and then an awful
thud. I loaded my gun and walked to-
wards the door, just as they came out,
dragging something—a body. As I drew
close the head fell back and I saw the
face. It was my own. I don’t remember
any more.
A drunken Lascar turned up at the house
of a peaceful settler near Paradise, Vic., the other
day, with a sharp axe in each hand, and a knife in

who had sooled a dog at him a year earlier, and he

his victim. A thoughtful neighbor put him to sleep

“Boswell”: A “Liberal” organiser up this
(Northern Rivers, N.S.W.) way has been discoursing
on “Sweated Childhood.” He takes the points (1)
that the evil only exists “in small quantities,” (2)
that legislation to suppress it would be a fearful
injustice and penalty to those who never practise it.
It is a bright, new point of view and casts a flood’
of light on a number of questions which were pre-
viously shrouded in mystery. Why, for example,
does the community rage so persistently against
the legal penalties that are imposed on bigamists?
Obviously (1) because bigamists are few; (2) be-
cause the laws against bigamy impose an intolerable
hardship on the vast majority who are not bigamists.
And so with burglary, murder and the like. In
fact, why have laws at all ? Or, to go a step
further, what is wrong with a “Liberal” campaign
in favor of Anarchy?
THE MISSING
WITNESSES.
IRATE MAGISTRATE: “We
must have order and
decorum in the court."
RAW RECRUIT (in a
voice of thunder): “Order
an' Decorum! Or-rder
an' Decorum ! ” ( After a
fearful pause.) “No ap-
pearance, your Worship."
“Wal” writes from the spot:—
The Religious Editor might like to hear of church
as it used to be in Papua in the bad old days. In
a place that I will not name, the people took the hat
around and the proceeds were sufficient to build a
small iron furnace, in which services were fried by
visiting parsons of the Anglican form of worship.
Once I had the joy of being present. The parson
arrived unexpectedly. The first sign of his presence
was the arrival of a “boy” with a dirty piece of
paper, on which the reverend one had scribbled that
he was going to hold service. The storekeeper, a
sober man, was the custodian of the church, so he
went to work with a couple of “boys,” and had the
feathers and marks of conflict of a cock-fight swept
into oblivion. The church was convenient for these
things, and most little events of the sort took place
there. After the church was presentable the store-
keeper lent the men half a dollar each, and they
awaited the parson, who lobbed along in time for
tea, as usual. After this very necessary meal had
been attended to (although some of the congregation
had theirs off a bottle), the crowd went to service.
The storekeeper held a hurricane lantern in one hand
and his hymn-book in the other, and they waded into
a hymn, one soul beefing out, “We Won’t Go Home
Till Mornin’ ” by mistake —the only song he knew.
When this was done all hands sat down, the seats
being empty whisky and beer cases, and several pipes
were lit, and a little conversation took place amongst
some of the “hard cases.” The sermon arrived in due
course, and the fun began. After a few words, one
old citizen bawled out, “Speak up, mister ; we can’t
’ear yer,” and a couple of others started to argue the
point about the parson’s religion.
“ ’E’s a Baptist,” said one old fossicker.
“No ’e ain’t; ’e’s one of them Primeval Methody’s,
which yer can see by ’is dial. All them blokes ’as
’eads on ’em like ’orses,” said the other.
“But ’e can tork like ’ell, anyway,” continued the
first.
“Yes, that’s right. But, yer see, all them blanks
’as ’eaps of teachin’ at this game, and ’e’s halways
readin’ ’ard to keep ’isself fit, so ’e hought ter be
able ter spout,” chimed in the other man.
“Hanyway, ’e ain’t a bad sort of blank,” and the
old chap spat with great accuracy at a wood bug
that was crawling up a stud.
Silence for a. while, then one old chap got up and
knocked a beer-case over as he went out. Standing
in the doorway, he said: “Any you blokes care for
a taste?” Nobody moved, so he went out.
The parson was droning along, and a couple of the
fellows were talking about a boy who had been killed
by some of the natives for stealing out of- a garden.
“Served the blank right,” said one man. “It’s a
carmine pity they don’t knock a few more of the
blanks on the sanguinary ’ead, 'cos it ’d stop the
blanks from runnin’ away so easy. I’d give ’em a
haxe for hevery blank they killed.”
Then a voice was heard saying: “I tell yer I ’ad
two haces hand three ladies, but, blank me, hif the
little adjective ’adn’t three kings with ’is two haces,
so I feli in.”
“Stinkin’ ’ard luck! ” sympathised his friend.
The parson was speaking about the curse of drink,
and how men should not fall under the sway of the
craving, and was driving home his argument when
a voice edged in with: “Give it them, Mister!”
And another voice reckoned “beer’s the best. Rum
and whisky’s too crimson toqgh for a long jag.”
Things were quiet for a while, and the parson
finished his sermon, and gave out the hymn.
Before they could start singing, one man thought
the proceedings were over, so he grabbed a hat and
went round for the collection. Each man duly
handed over his half-dollar.. The hat carrier pro-
posed a vote of thanks to the parson, which was
carried unanimously, and all hands went out for “an
oil.”
“ ’Phone 5” : What must surely constitute
a record of attempts to acquire a farm by means cf
land ballots is held by one J. Holman, farmer, of Wom-
bat (N-S.W.). For the past 10 years he has tried his
luck in 11 different districts, and has lodged as
many as four applications in one week. On one
occasion he covered 22 blocks with the one applica-
tion, and, as usual, his marble failed to come to
light. From Dubbo to Guyra, and as far on the
Riverina as Wagga, he has travelled, in his endeavors
to win a ballot, and has had as much as £2OO
deposited in application money. While he is wait-
ing for his luck to change he is share-farming.

“Gecko”: The pouch-cheeked platypus
is one of the very few animals despised by abori-
ginals as an article of diet, although why this should
be so in the case of the female of the species I do
not know. On the other hand, I can understand why
the male is not placed on the menu. Stink! I’ll
back a freshly-trapped buck platypus to whoop two
octaves higher on the smell register than a brace of
Ohows. The stench is positively stifling, and as a
weapon of offence has no equal in the Australian
bush. Peculiarly enough, Lady Broadbill carries no
such bouquet, and will cut out at least 20 ounces of
good red meat, yet it is a fact that natives have
been known to die of starvation rather than sample it.

right enuff, but one what stops the beer
supply is a public calamity."
SECOND : “ My view exactly. Look at the

have to pul up with."
Melbourne Argus, dealing with the burn-
ing topic of egg-laying, puts it like this: “The re-
cord was made by six White Leghorns. The second
place was taken by Mrs. Uren, of Kapunda, with
1319.”

pleted a two months’ diet of potatoes.
-—A recent scientific item.
And so it ijslds the breath of Life,
Likewise the bone and blood;
It represents the Cosmic Strife—
The homely, honest spud !
The hopes and dreams and faiths of men
Peer from its sprouting eyes ;
The mighty thoughts that move the pen; '
The codes we exercise.
The world’s delight, and its remorse,
Its saving and its sin,
Abide in proud potential force
Beneath that brownish skin.
Ambition’s urge, that strongly bids
Our restless souls to soar-;
The strengtli that builds the Pyramids
Are in the murphy’s core.
The will that drives us overseas
Where danger takes its toll—
That lured us where the oceans freeze
Until we reached the Pole;
The heroism that defeats
The gale when anchors drag,
May now be purchased down the street
For half-a-crown a bag.
The glances of untutored Love,
The handclasp and the kiss,
The voices of the cooing dove—
The Future’s chrysalis;
The fancies of the novelist,
The star-dreams of the bard,
The joys of the philanthropist,
Are growing in the yard.
The quarrels that are crimson-hued,
The hates that are intense,
The good the world has misconstrued
Are flowering through the fepce.
Ah, angels’ menu mystical,
Your name is written Mud ;
For.yonder is the Seed of All—
The shy and simple spud!

“Edd.vson”: The pig-headed man has
done much for creation, but Alex. Cameron, of Tin-
whistle, although more pig-headed than Oliver Crom-
well and the late N. Bonaparte combined, lived and
flourished in too small a sphere and too narrow an
age to butt a very considerable dint in the universe.
However, Alexander did his best with the materials
and opportunities at hand. He was engineer at the
Garibaldi mine, Tinwhistle, and had been coming
and going on the same, narrow, well-beaten track
between his house, in the township, and the engine-
house on the hill, for nearly four years, when the
Presbyterians started to erect their eight-by-ten
cathedral. Alexander was of Presbyterian lineage
himself, and had no antipathy to kirks as such, but
was dreadfully set against this one as an obstruction
to traffic, since it was being built right across his way
to work, and intersected his way home. If Alex, was
to respect the kirk in the making, he must now go
round, and flounder through a certain amount of scrub
fern. “I gie ye due warnin’,” clamored Alexander
Cameron to the elders, “I’ll no recognise the kurrk.”
Alex, punched a hole in the new fence, and went
through, clambering over the building material, but-
ting the carpenters out of his way, and waging
unholy war with those who resisted him. Coming
home from afternoon shift shortly after midnight one
dark morning, the revolting Scot fell from the partly-
built wall of the kirk he was climbing, and broke
THE WAY OUT.
COCKNEY AT HOME : “ Don l l have it on yer
mind , Bill. Me old gran father went out
as one o[?] them hassisted henugrants. Yiv
gotten get pinched first.”
two ribs. When he got about again the building
was almost finished. Alexander took an axe and
punched a hole in the north wall. He punched an-
other hole in the south wall, in a line with his
old track, and went his way. The Kirk sued Cam-
eron, and he had to pay damages, but he continued
to battle his way through the sacred edifice till fines
brought him to the verge of ruin. Then he took a
light ladder with him, and went over the church,
varying the process by going through with his axe,
when he had saved a little money, and could afford
to indulge himself. Now and then Cameron went
battering his way in by one wall and out by the
other, when service was under way, on which occa-
sions the “meenister” hurled hell and opprobrium at
him as he passed. But Alex, did not mind the
curse ecclesiastic ; he stuck to his road rights. Then
came the heaviest flood that ever visited Tinwhistle.
It lifted the kirk, carried it about 200 yards down
stream, and set it up in elder Saunders’s back yard.
Next Sunday service was held as usual, and, in the
midst of the reverent performance, Alexander Cam-
eron appeared at the door. “So, there ye are,” he
said. “Ah, weel, Ah’m glad t’ see the Loard has a
wee bit sense, if ye ha’ none yersels.” Then Alex-
ander joirled in prayer.

A SHRED OF ROMANCE.
“An she gets that jealous of me if Pm as
much as seen speakin ’ to another woman.”
“O. B. J. Burrs”: Most comforting reli-
gious exercise I wot of is anew one now being prac-
tised by John Maori. The tohunga, or priestess, brings
a sick person (and there are always plenty on hand)
into the meeting house. The “choir” howls a hymn
in the mystical semi-darkness, and the sick Henare or
Meri is treated to a tablespoonful or two of brandy.
The “case” is then stripped, and a small (very small)
amount rubbed into its hide,
while the sipping process is
repeated at intervals. The ad-
herents of this “karakia'’
dress themselves in scarlet,
blue and yellow, and the
“pariha,” or lodge, holds
forth once a week and car-
ries its pleasantries on till
dawn bursts forth. The holy
water is generally of the
three-star variety, but as
there is a contravention of
the Act which bars Henare
from keeping a drop of
“stuff” on his premises, the
local police are focussing the
frozen optic of the law on
the new belief.

“Gunner” re appar-
ently unaccountable gun
burstings. A few years ago
a well-known African big-
game hunter leant his rifle
against a tree whilst he had
something to eat. About half
an hour later he fired at a
deer, and the rifle, anew one
by a famous London gun-
maker, burst half-way down
the barrel. The explosion
nearly killed him. In the
brief interval for refreshments,
a c'»tain kind of spider had
made its nest of damp clay
in the muzzle, completely
plugging it up; hence the ac-
cident. The late Lieutenant
Boyd Alexander, who was
murdered in the French Con-
go, told the present writer
that these spiders, when they
know that rain is near, build
themselves a waterproof residence of mud or clay in
an incredibly short time, leaving a passage for egress.
His native carriers brought him many of these spiders’
houses, the tenants having vacated them. They were
as big as a walnut, nearly perfectly round in shape,
and as hard as granite.
“5.5.5.,” concerning our cheerful brother
in Papua: Out above Mafula, in the Macoa district,
and along the Bamu River, there are some wonder-
fully skilled anatomists amongst the natives, and
the gift of being able to cut up a man while keep-
ing him alive until there are only a few bones left
for the stockpot, is quite common. The patient is
generally seized from behind, and placed backward
over a log. His joints are broken, and steaks carved
from them, and cooked and eaten in his presence. As
a rule the victim is kept alive for six days, while the
festivities go on around him. When he is close up
dead, his brains are scooped out, and partaken of
while they are warm. They are more digestible in
that state.

Pulling the Le>g of Labor,.
Melbourne Age has chosen to defend the
action of a suburban municipality in closing
the local picture shows on Sunday, for Sun-
day’s sake. The moving force in all such
action is Wowserious. It is not inspired by
solicitude for Labor’s right to a day of rest.
The snuffling cry of Sabbatarianism rises
higher in the estimation of the precious
Authorities than the evidence which the local
police give in favor of orderly Sunday enter-
tainments. A picture show attracts the young
loafers, the street corner expectorators, the
damsels with a tendency to seek darkness in
the parks, and the men whose alternative
form of amusement is mostly Beer. It
makes for morality without a doubt. In all
suburbs the police bear witness to the fact.
But Wowserism abhors the Sunday picture
shows, and works the Rights of Labor “gag”
into the demand for their suppression. There
is nothing surprising in the attitude of the
saints, who would make attendance at prayer
meetings compulsory on the public if they
could. The astonishing thing is to find the
Age— a professedly Liberal journal—stretch-
ing the truth on behalf of the cause of
Snuffle, whilst hypocritically protesting that
“the question must be decided rather on the
grounds of public utility than on those of
religion.” A recent Age article, dealing
with the picture-show question, was a tissue
of false reasoning worth quoting:—
The Sunday law against trading should be opera-
tive everywhere on the same plane. The trams and
the railvyays run for half the Sunday to supply a
great public want. But nobody can say the same of
picture shows and theatres. The workers in those in-
stitutions need the day of rest, and they Cannot have
it if their avocations are to extend over the seven
days of the week. Pleasure-seeking as the Australians
are, they have plenty of means of recreation in
taking their fill of the bounties of Nature, without
keeping theatre attendants all day at duty on the
Sunday.
Now, working backwards in criticism of the
arguments aforesaid, it is, firstly, to be re-
marked that the picture shows which private
rationalists and the official guardians of law-
anorder favor are open only for an hour and
a half on Sunday night. The labor they em-
ploy is that of an operator, whose place can
he efficiently filled by an understudy on this
seventh night, and whom the Law has al-
wavs permitted to work twice on Saturdays,
anyhow, at times when most other workers
are forbidden to toil for a living. Two or
three men who collect silver coins at the
entrance to the hall, or are engaged in look-
ing around, represent all the rest of the
laboring at the ordinary Sunday-night pic-
ture show. The orchestra is cut out in
nearly all cases, and its absence makes no
difference to the performance on the screen.
Therefore, to bracket picture halls and the-
atres together, and to speak of the injustice
to Labor in permitting the employees to be
“all day at duty on the Sunday,” was to
grossly falsify the true aspects of the matter.
Of the three or four, or five, or six people
actually essential to the running of a cine-
matograph entertainment for an hour and a
half on Sunday, there is not one who must
necessarily labor seven nights a week. The
Labor arguments available against Sunday
performances of comic opera, or “Kismet,” or
a thickly-populated and elaborately-staged
bellowdrama cannot be advanced in this
case. A picture show can be put upon the
screen by an emergency operator. It does
not demand an orchestra or stage hands. In
place of the usual ticket sellers and ushers,
the staff in front of the house consists of two
or three lynx-eyed brethren, who stand at the
entrance like elders and wardens of the kirk,
and take up a collection which closely re-
sembles a church collection fls Regards the
majority of threepenny-bits. Wowseristtl
merely pretends to be pitting the Traded
Unionist cock against the evil bird of Ration-
alism. The rooster that Wowserism has
fitted with spurs proves, on examination, to
be a spurious champion. It is a cock that
will not fight. The permission to run pic-
ture shows on Sunday night does not imply
the possibility of “The Girl in the Train”
being produced on the Day of Rest to an
audience that would pay for admission with
threepenny-bits dropped in a plate, any more
than the running of Sunday trains amounts
to .the legalisation of the steam-roundabout,
or switchback, fot Sunday trading purposes;
The newspaper that ignores these distinc-
tions in Sunday entertainments, and cries
out against them all from a Labor platform*
is endeavoring to pull the leg of the com-
munity.
The Splendidly Mendacious Budget.
The British Chancellor of the Exchequer
delivered his Budget speech last week, and
the irreconcilable Freetrader professed to
find a heap of encoufagement in it. Sydney
Telegraph, for example, flfited ffs follows
Never was England so prosperous. There Could
have been no greater proof of the soundness of the
industrial position in Great Britain than the fact
that the money market has stood the shock of one
of the most tremendous upheavals in British history,
etc., etc.
That under the nationally suicidal British
system of big landlords and huge imports and
starvation wages, thousands of shrewd busi-
ness men—largely Jews and aliens —are able
to tear money off the face of the landscape
no one has ever questioned. To that extent,
the Cold Country is, no doubt, prosperous;
and the number of motor-cars and the size
and costliness of the hotels and restaurants
and the gorgeous raiment of many of the
women and men of the great cities are a
source of wondering admiration to visitors
from abroad. On the other hand, the direct
and indirect taxation which all hands have
to bear in one form or another is stupefying
to natives of mere Protectionist countries.
The fortunate few are able easily to pay
what is asked of them, though their howls of
protest are loud and persistent enough. But
beneath them, financially, is a huge class —
the “lower middle class” that Gissing knew
so well —to whom Britain’s leaping revenue
represents a nightmare of stinting and saving
and debasing hard-upness that may never be
exorcised. And, lower still, is a wolfish
crowd, variously estimated at from 12 to 15
millions, who can only pay their country’s
dues in kind—by means of sweated labor,
half-starved children, prostituted daughters
and similar intolerable sacrifices. The ex-
istence of these two classes—daily becoming
more desperate, as the cost of living rises
and their wage rates remain stationary, and
daily growing more articulate and apprecia-
tive of the injustice of their lot by reason of
cheap education —is the very first factor that
must be taken into consideration when
Britain’s “stable” and “prosperous” condi-
tion is mentioned. Asa matter of cold fact,
things industrial and otherwise in the United
Kingdom are far from sound, and it is. evi-
dent that none realise it better than those
people on the spot who have most to lose by
a popular upheaval of the sort that mostly
follows on rotten social conditions. Only a
couple of days before the details of the Lloyd
George Budget arrived here by cable there
came to this office by post a circular from a
London body which calls itself “The Friends
of the Poor.” It opens this way:— *
We, in England, are now in the depth of the dark
dreary days of winter, and I venture to send this
letter over the seas to ask all your readers who re-
member the grim struggle for .existence that goes
on ceaselessly in the slums of the Mother-land, to
join our ranks to-day, and become a “Friend of the
Poor” at home.
The president is a Royal Princess, and the
officials are Dukes, Marchionesses, Earls and
other representatives of the moneyed classes.
It is no sudden affair, formed to mitigate the
shock of “one of the most tremendous up-
heavals in British history,” but an institu-
tion of long standing; and it is but one of
hundreds. The British aristocracy is a pub-
lic-spirited one, as aristocracies go, but it is
not turning itself- into a begging-letter writer
on a vast scale for nothing. Philanthropy in
this case is a form of self-protection. For
the first time in history the Royal family has
taken to foregoing race-meetings and other
festivities for fear of exasperating the snarl-
ing mob. On every side is gloom and doubt
and hesitancy. The whole country is full of
capital trembling for its life. In such cir-
cumstances, a bumper Budget signifies no-
thing. As the Prophet, or someone, hath it:
Better a fiver in a fire-and-burglar-proof safe
than a million-pound note in a burning wood-
shack.
A PATRIOTIC LAY.

tion by six White Leghorns from the Redfern Poultry
Farm, Caulfield (Victoria), With a score of 1589,
this eclipsing the Burnley record of 1566 by Mr. R.
W. Pope’s pen by 23.
Australia, my native land,
Whose fields with golden treasures sWay,
Upon whose lovely sunlit strand
The blue Pacific's waters play,
Thv triumph once again proclaim,
And spread the glory of thy name.
Thy pullets from all comers strip
The world’s egg-laying championship !
Thy grandeur envious strangers see,
Thy prowess proud all nations know.
The strength.thy children have from thee
Has laid a hundred rivals low.
What if the “ashes” have gone hence?
Here is a splendid recompense-
Thy hens (true oof-birds) show their worth
Against the hens of all the earth.
Then, Austral, flaunt thy starry flag
And give three patriot cheers.
Let foolish foreign countries brag
Of hardy polar pioneers.
To thee must go, exulting nation,
Whose hens “lay over” all creation,
The palm. Thou hast without a doubt
A great deal more to crow about!

A brutal man talks :
Mrs. Cameron Swan-ragette is a lady of the domes-
ticated dr fireside variety, whom one would expect
would employ her time in working brocade. Mrs.
Swan does not possess either the braininess or the
personality of Muriel Matters, the female vote-chaser
who descended on us a couple of years ago ; neither
is she so youthful. Her age probably lies some-
where in the vicinity of the mid-thirties. She wears
the suffragette badge of green, white and purple;
green “for the faith that encircles the cause,”
white “for the purity of the cause,” and purple for
something or other that I disremember. In addition,
she wears a special “Hunger badge,” which is the
suffragettes’ V.C. Mrs. Swan mentions, with a glow
of pride, that insurance premiums on plate-glass

Our greatest difficulty to-day is within, viz., how to
unite the Liberal party. There are other sections-
than yours. Some look at the question from a dif-
ferent standpoint from what you do. Co-operation
is desired, but it must be co-operation without sacri-
fice of principle on either side. (Cheers.) We make
none ourselves, and we ask none from them. (Cheers.)
— Mr. Deakin, at a Liberal picnic.

Now, what are we going to do about this
post?”
windows have been doubled in the Fog City since the
voteiess sisterhood commenced operations; but she
is most proud of the prison reforms which the suffra-
gettes were more or less instrumental in effecting.
When, at one of her lectures, the Swan lady spoke
of the success of the agitation against the refusal of
the prison authorities to allow the incarcerated ones
to wear garters, a shout of feminine delight frac-
tured the welkin.

“Alexandrian,” from the Inside: —
The Bulletin erred in one respect, last week, in
the course of its surmises as to the men who were
responsible for the recent appointments to the
N. S. Wales Upper House. The late Dacey, M.L.A.,
did not nominate Joynton Smith or anyone" else. As
a matter of fact, he was fiercely opposed to the
creation of fresh Councillors, and wanted his party
to make the straight-out extermination of the Stout
House one of its leading electioneering planks or
howls.
Architect Peter Kerr, having reached the
age of 92, decided, the other day, that it was a
fair thing. He arrived in Melbourne in
1852. For a while he raised cattle on the
Upper Yarra, but the only scope for his
art being the designing of wire fences and
milking sheds, he left the land, and settled
in Melbourne. The Royal Commission on
Parliamentary buildings, which sat in 1877,
gave him the job of designing the Victorian
Parliament House. Amongst other achieve-
ments, he had, ere ever he thought of visit-
ing the blighted Colonies, superintended the
additions that were made to Dunrobin Castle
when Queen Victoria and her husband ac-
cepted the then Duke of Sutherland’s invi-
tation to a Saturday-to-Monday visit. Later,
he helped Sir James Barry to design the
Westminster Houses —the plans whereof, by
the way, are still alleged by the descendants
of Pugin to have been filched by Barry from
that worshipper of the Gothic in art. Part
of the G.P.O. and other Government build-
ings in Melbourne are blamed on to Kerr.
As he carelessly stepped off a P’ran (Vic.)
tram the other evening a passing motor-car
swept into eternity a man whose name had
appeared in the papers more often than he
wanted it —Frederick Ogle. Ogle came to
Melbourne in ’B2, with a fair share of
wealth, but flying women and lagging horses
soon dissipated it, and thenceforward he
lived by his wits. That they weren’t of
champion quality was proved by the fact
that the law got the better of the argument
several times, first in ’B7 for “long firm”
swindling or false pretences. After that,
Ogle was “downed” in several bouts, but he
wasn’t always unsuccessful —from his point
of view—as he managed to live and often
to enjoy many of life’s luxuries. His last
public appearance in Melbourne was before
Judge Johnston, on the usual charge, which
culminated in a sentence of five years’ gaol.
He had been on bail, and on being searched
before entering the dock was found to have
a fully loaded revolver in his pocket—for
what special purpose he declined to explain.
Ogle’s real claim to distinction, however,
was his bearing and manner. Tall, fair, of
military carriage, with long, drooping mous-
tache, polished manners and cultured con-
versation, the wonder is he didn’t marry
some rich widow or well-dowered maiden.
And now a common, stinking car ends his
varied career. What’s the good of it all?
Homer Lea, author of
the U.S.A war-scare
book, “The Valor of Ig-
norance,” is getting
beans in various quar-
ters, especially now that
his volum e —which
showed how easily .Japan
could invade California
—has been translated
into Japanese, under the
title “The War Between
Japan and America.”
Professor Starr Jordan,
of Leland Stanford Uni-
versity (he lectured in
Australia a few years
back), shouts in the ear
of the Tokyo papers that
this so-called “General”
Lea “has not, or never
had, any connection with
the U.S. army, nor with
any other recognised
army.” He put in a year
or two at Stanford Uni-
versity, went to Canton
in 1900, “joined some
secret society of agita-
tors, and came back soon
with a title from this
society which he trans-
lates as Lieut enant-
General.” Meanwhile, the
book, advertised as a
showing-up of the weak
places of the U.S. by
“General Lea, an Ameri-
can Staff Officer,” is having a “best-seller”
circulation in Japan.
The father of the late J. R. Dace.v. N.S.W.
Treasurer and member for Alexandria, was
an Irish barrister. He died immediately
after his son was born, and then Mrs. Dacey
took her three-year-old boy to Victoria. A
year later she passed away, and an ancient
medico at Kyneton, Dr. Smith, adopted the
orphan. His path seems to have been
smooth enough until he reached the age of
12, and then, as ancient medicoes are not
immortal, he started to hack out his own
living. At first he was a butcher’s assist-
ant. Later, he became a blacksmith, and,
like Tubal Cain, he was a mighty good one.
Also, he managed a branch business for May
and Miller, agricultural implement makers,
who are still in business in Victoria. Dacey
was a mechanic by instinct, and an inventor
when he had the time. The best-known pro-
duct of his brain is the forest devil,
which should be called faith, for if the
chain is long enough, and the whole outfit
is strong enough, and the two ends of it are
hooked to two mountains, and a capable man
gets on to the lever in the middle, one moun-
tain must shift.
Australians will remember Captain H. S.
Watkins, the aviator who came to this coun-
try with Scott, intending to fly the latter
part of the journey to the South Pole. He
smashed his machine up hopelessly in Ade-
laide before the expedition started. Wat-
kins had another stroke of ill-luck last
month. Flying in England, on one of the
Spencer School’s biplanes, he got into the
air-wash of another machine, and was
bumped to the cold, hard ground. He broke
his leg, amongst other damages, and 25 per
cent, had to be written off him for deprecia-
tion.
GRANNY INTRODUCES HER FRIEND.
Now we have no particular dislike to borrowing
per se as long as the borrowed money is prudently
expended. What we do object to is the hypocrisy of
it all. Why should Mr. Fisher not fairly and squarely
own up once and for all that the non-borrowing fad
was impracticable, and has been abandoned? Such
candor would disarm criticism, and would prove an
object-lesson to the caucus and those behind the
caucus.—S. M. Herald.
THE TEMPTRESS : “It's very naughty of you,
Mr. Fisher , to borrow your surplus note
issue money. But I don tin the least mind
your obtaining a loan foom the State’s old
friend, Mr. Goldstein.”
“Floater” speaks :
Justice Isaacs proposes to have some feminine
Society on the High Court Bench. His brilliant
daughter, Nancy, who holds a high degree, has been
booked as his associate, and will commence her
official duties on June 1, or thereabouts. The ap-
pointment has caused many male wigs in the Law
to stand up stiff in consternation, and it is con-
sidered only a matter of time when there will be
some fresh and perfumed Portia in a High Court
seat itself. Possibly the lady will fill her position
well, but every time this sort of thing happens a
fresh thorn is added to the servant girl problem.
When Portia rises to the Bench she leaves a woman’s
place vacant below, and there is a general move-up.
At the far end of the line Mary Anne moves up.
The death of Treasurer Dacey, at the early
age of 56, removes a notable figure from
N.S.W. politics. He was an Irishman from
Cork, but as he was an adopted Australian
for 53 years of his life that should not be
cast up against him nor set down in his
favor. For 26 years he was a manufacturer,
alderman, mayor and other personages in
the neighborhood of Alexandria (Sydney),
and he sat in Parliament for 17 years. His
first win of the Botany seat (1895) was
achieved by just three votes —that is to say,
he got 610 votes while his nearest opponent
got 607, and his two opponents jointly 797.
In 1898 he in by a majority of 47, but
there were five candidates, and Dacey had
only 568 votes out of a total of 1802. In
1901 he had a straight-out win in a two-
man fight, his majority being 209; but in
1904, at Alexandria, he was returned for the
third time as a minority representative. He
beat his nearest opponent by 117, but he
only had 2859 supporters while the other
three candidates had 2881 among them. It
was not till 1907, when he decisively de-
feated “Briggy” Bruntnell, formerly of the
Sal. Army, that he ceased to be the precari-
ous holder of a very precarious seat. He
was a strenuous Laborite sitting for a good
Labor constituency, but the fact that he was
an employer instead of a worker for wages
created an unreasoning prejudice against
him. The worst that could be said of him
was that he was, like Premier McGowen, a
supporter of the parochial and anti-Federal
sentiment. On the other hand, he was a
good democrat on most points, a believer in
the anti-loan policy (it was probably for
this reason that far inferior men climbed
over his head into the wildly-extravagant
McGowen Ministry), an honest politician,
something of a student, and a man who
was de,eply respected by his political oppon-
ents, except, perhaps, those of the larrikin
and bottle-throwing variety who respect no-
thing. It was his misfortune that he became
Treasurer just before he died, and his first
work was to shoulder the nominal responsi-
bility for an erratic Income Tax Bill that
hac been drafted before he arrived on the
scene. It was his other misfortune that he
passed out before he had time to present a
Budget that was really his own. If he had
lived another year or two he might have
gained much credit, for those who were best
acquainted with him suspected him of more
financial ability than the average.
G. T. Bean, just dead in London, had
only one thing to distinguish him from other
old-timers who made their money in Aus-
tralia and spent it in England. He was the
first South Australian born to get into the
local Parliament. This was in 1868, when
the Province was only 31 years old, so a
native-born politician needed to be fairly
precocious. The late R. C. Baker was
elected to the same Parliament only a week
or two later. Bean had for years been a
London “Guinea-pig” on a lofty scale. In
fact, he was one of the top pigs on the
ladder.
Among the unlucky
folk who took ship into
the Infinite per s.s.
Koombana, wrecked by a
typhoon near Bedout
Island (W. A.), was
George Harper, a grand-
son of surveyor Harper,
of Picton (N.S.W.) —
and Harper was the man
who laid out Grafton, on
Ma’s North Coast, and
who was assistant to
Hoddle, and Hoddle was
the man who laid out
Yarraopolis, or Mel-
bourne. Old Harper
was a close personal
friend of Hamilton
Hume, and, like that
notable man, an explorer
into what were thought
then to be the waste
spaces—but which have
since proved to be the
best space s—of Aus-
tralia. Young Harper,
who has just been laid
away in the biggest ceme-
tery on earth, was only
27 years of age. He was a connec-
tion by marriage of Fred Broomfield, writer
and occasional bard. Harper was returning
home after a voyage to Singapore—whither
he had gone to look into some big pearling
propositions.
“Chasuble” writes: I mentioned in this
paper, a month or two ago, that the Pope
had a presentiment he would not survive his
ninth year, because all his former experi-
ence had been in terms of nine years, sever-
ally’ as student, curate, vicar, bishop and
cardinal. Though the report of his death
was a false alarm, there are still three
months to run, and his age is 77 years. It
is alleged that he owed his election to the
Austrian Emperor, who declared against
Rampolla, Chancellor to Leo XIII. Ram-
polla stood for the Conservatives, Vannu-
telli for the Liberals, and Gotti for the
Moderates. Rampolla’s backers transferred
their votes to Sarto, and he won. An im-
portant man who will find his Roman nose
put out of joint when the election does
come is Cardinal Merry Del Val, Secretary
of State. He is Spanish, and the Pope must
be Italian. Pius’s striking acts have in-
cluded the “Ne Temere,” and the attempted
utter revolution of church music, by revert-
ing to the dismal old Gregorian. Among the
candidates who are waiting, Vannutelli is
by this time rather too old, but he has won
dclat as Delegate Apostolic at the London
and Montreal Eucharistic Congresses. Gotti
is much too old; Rampolla is not, and he
will almost certainly throw his hat in the
ring, as Roosevelt, the lion demolisher, pul
it.

Even a private hospital is not incap-
able of lapsing into sentiment. Edmund
Fisher, of this paper, who suffered a
’citis operation (with complication trim-
mings) a year ago, received last Saturday
a basket of roses from the high priestess
and staff of the South Yarra establishment
where he lay and groaned the weary weeks
away. A letter explained the cause of this
fragrant floral tribute -
To-morrow will be the anniversary of your but-
chery at “Rosmore,” and we are writing to congratu-
late you on the luck you had to survive it all. We
are sending you some flowers, and are very pleased
to think they are going to the Melbourne office of
The Bulletin, and not to the ghosts’ playground at
Kew.

TOO DASHED OLD!
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Dr. Wiley, chief of the United States Chemistry
Bureau, at Washington, has told a gathering of health
seekers that it is possible to raise man’s average
longevity to 93 years. —News item.
Why should I live to be ninety-three ?
Whatever would be the use of me?
Why should 1 mumble
And wheeze
And sneeze
And keep on the grumble
And rub my knees?
When all sane sinners are in their beds,
Why should I cling to Life’s dregs and shreds,
And cackle away in unholy glee?
Why should I live to be ninety-three ?
Why should I live to be ninety-two
And cumber the earth till all goes blue?
Why should I linger
And moan
And groan
And shake a forefinger
All skin and bone
At careless Youth as he passes by?
And glare at him with a rheumy eye,
Because I am jealous of Springtime? Pooh!
Why should I live to be ninety-two?
Why should I live to be ninety-one,
When all Life’s flavor and sting is done?
Why should I grimly
Grow old
And cold
While granddaughters primly,
Because they are told,
“Look after Grandpa! You know, my dear,
lie may not live for another year!”
You babies of eighty may think that f n,
But I don’t want to be ninety-one!

'I his was the old Post Office Savings Bank of N. S.
Wales, an institution which was not transferred to
the Commonwealth along with the post office, as it
should have been. Australian Advances to Settlers
business had also been started by the Government
and was run on a semi-philanthropic basis. It was
twin-brother of the Farmers’ Seed Wheat Fund, and
was designed mainly to give help to settlers whose
assets didn’t appeal to the private money-lender.
The two businesses were presently amalgamated, and
the control of the whole concern—Savings Bank and
Advances Department alike —is given over to three
commissioners, with R. A. Warden, one of the most
experienced bankers in the country, as chairman.
The bank has no paid capital in the ordinary sense
of the term, but behind it stands the entire wealth
of the country. In the last extremity the State has
the right to tax the wealth-owners to the extent of
20s. in the £ ; and that is the guarantee fund or
uncalled capital behind this bank. Naturally, there-
fore, since good seasons have prevailed and money
has been plentiful, coin has poured in. This shows
the total of the deposits:—
1901. . £6,647,289 1907. . £11,128,495
1902.. 7,100,108 1908.. 12,118,772
1903.. 7,018,425 1909.. 13,303,421
1904.. 7,952,885 1910.. 15,190,820
1905.. 8,883,651 1911.. 17,595,695
1906.. 9,322,923
Tlius there has been the astonishing increase of nearly
threefold in 10 years—just about as good an advt.
as any State could ask for, and just about as gloomy
a fact as any anti-Sosher could strike when he is
arguing that the people don’t want and wouldn’t
trust State control.
The interest ' paid to depositors within certain
limits is 3 p.c., but the average amount paid was
£2 14s. lid. p.c. The Act prescribes that at least
15 p.c. of the assets shall be kept on deposit at call
or short notice. This amount is at the Treasury;
another, £12,182,092, is in N.S.W. Funded Stock or
Treasury bills. Only £618,880 is out on mort-
gage ; but the Advances Department is financed by
this branch, which has accepted debentures at 3, 3}
aiid 3| p.c. for a total of £1,205,000. If the Ad-
vances Department has any cash that it has no use
for, the Savings branch takes it at call. The Savings
and Advances branches are kept distinct, but they are
thus interlaced at many points. Besides the deposits
( £17,595,695) there are the reserves of £138,822
and, sundry other credits, and the total assets of
£17,779,489 are cut up this way:—
£ p.c.
Loans to N.S.W. Government . . 14,257,384 80.2
Loans to other Governments . . 108,076 0.6
Loans to Advances Department. . 1,205,000 6.8
Municipal loans.. .. .. 598,614 3.3
Fixed deposits . . . . . . 305,000 1.7
Mortgages . . . . . . 618,880 3.5
Bank premises . . . . . . 160“00 0.9
Till money and accrued interest 526,535 3.0
Total £17,779,489 100.0
Including accrued interest, 82 p.c. of the total funds
are lent to the State Government. This explains
why the small State politician thinks it such a dread-
ful crime *to transfer the control of the bank to the
Commonwealth. It would be just as dreadful a crime
to transfer it to the finance committee of the cheru-
bim and seraphim.
The history of the Advances Department is shown
next:—
Nominal

Profit.
1907 .. £4735 19,054
1908 .. 4661 23,715

Losses of A. to S. Board written off, 13933 .. 8,040
1910 .. 7566 15,606
1911 .. 9744 25,350
Though the old Advances to Settlers Board showed
some reserves, they were quite nominal, and when
the assets came to be realised, losses in excess of
the alleged reserves had to be written off. During
the past couple of years some small recoveries have
been made ; last year, for instance, the recoveries in
excess of the losses written off on account of the
old business amounted to £2OO, and this sum has
been added to the profit. The actual profit made by
the Advances Department in five years, apart from
the net losses of the old semi-charity written off,
appears to be £31,338. No doubt in less prosperous
times some losses may turn up to wipe out part of
this profit; but on present appearances the Com-
missioners have done excellently, notwithstanding
that every violent anti-Sosher knew that as soon as a
State Bank was started,, the desperate politician would
have the free run of the till for the benefit of him-
self and his hard-up constituents. Asa matter of
fact, the trouble is not that it is too easy to get
money from the Advances Department, but that it
is too hard. The terms, especially in the matter of
repayments, are extraordinarily liberal; but the
bank isn’t so accessible for small casual loans as
the private bank with an open-eyed manager waiting
at the farmer’s door. Apart from old Advances to
Settlers Board loans, there were 2649 advances cur-
rent on December 31 ; and the total outstanding was
£974,547. Evidently there are a heap of settlers
and would-be settlers who still don’t know (1) the
easy system of repayment, and (2) the fact that,
if the farmer strikes a good season, and wants to
reduce his debt, he can pay in any amount he likes
and get interest at the same rate as he is paying.
This virtually reduces his debt, but doesn’t stop him
from withdrawing the money in the event of a bfld
season hitting him presently.
The Closer Settlement Promotion Act provides for
still more extraordinarily liberal assistance. Under
this law, passed in 1910, but only last year put to
work, “any three or more persons who are qualified
to make and hold settlement purchases,” may borrow
“the whole or part of the purchase money,” pro-
vided that (1) all the land is bought from one
vendor, and (2) the sum to be paid does not exceed
the valuation of the land fixed by the Closer Settle-
ment Advisory Board and the Savings Bank Com-
missioners. The Savings Bank advances the money ;
but “there shall be a special reserve fund to which
shall be carried any profit or loss arising from trans-
actions under this Act. An}' deficiencies in such
fund, at the end of any financial year of the bank,
shall be made good from the Consolidated Revenue
Fund, upon such deficiency being certified to by the
Commissioners.” Under this Act 128 farms were
carved out of 19 estates last year, and £251,766
was paid by the bank to vendors —an average of
£1967 per farm. This money was got by the Ad-
vances Department from the Savings Bank at 3}
p.c. ; and as the interest payable by the borrowers
is only 4 p.c., there is a margin of only } p.c. to
provide for exes, and losses. It is such a trifle that
the reserve will grow very slowly, and if a bad
slump should happen the State Treasury may have
to face an unpleasant call. Still, a spot-cash pur-
chase may appeal to the big landlord, who may,
therefore, cut the price; and that, and the absence
of commission-loading, combined with the very low
rate of interest, will enable many a settler under
this Act to pull through while his more heavily bur-
dened neighbor collapses. If the Government took
half as much trouble to get the settler’s product off
the land as it does to get the settler himself on the
land, everything in the settler’s garden would be
lovely.

Bank deposit receipt rates have been
raised all round by 4 p.c., and 4 p.c. is now being
offered for fixed deposits at two years. The move-
ment originated with three purely Victorian banks—
the Royal, the Colonial and the Victoria —which found
their advances, especially in the country, increasing
too quickly. The other” Melbourne bankers followed
suit, and it is an open secret that the objective of
the movement towards dearer money is dual in char-
acter. The banks want to block all local loans for
the time being, by Governments and other public
bodies. The Victorian loan was really a bad failure,
because the general public did not apply, and the
underwriters, chiefly banks and life assurance com-
panies, will carry that baby for at least 12 months,
perhaps longer. The public will not take up Gov-
ernment bonds and stocks to return £3 15s. p.c.,
when they can get £4 and their capital back with-
out any loss by commission when they want the
money. All public debentures are likely to be dull
of sale during the winter months, and lower prices are
certain to ensue. Besides, bankers openly assert they
don’t like the look of things in Sydney. Stocks are
too heavy, importations are excessive, and too much
money is being locked up in land and building. Of
course, it is a passing phase, but while the Australian
gold yield continues to fall down every month, and
the rain does not fall near so regularly, money is
likely to be tight, and, therefore, dearer. Another
cause of apprehension to money merchants is the ex-
cessive loan expenditure of New South Wales, and
incidentally, of Westralia. The only brake that can
be easily and quickly applied to Government ex-
travagance is to make money scarce, and that’s what
a 4 p.c. rate for deposits means, allied with 8 p.c. for
overdrafts. Fisher’s future troubles are likely to be
financial.

The sales for the half-year totalled £22,800, as
against £13,867 in the corresponding period seven
years ago. The progress isn’t rapid, but it is per-
sistent, which is probably better. Still, if there was
a trifle more speed the society would be able to give
better results to shareholders and customers alike,
because the standing charges wouldn’t increase at
the same ratio as the turnover. The book debts are
more than they ought to be ; this means that the co.
is cramped and isn’t in a position to get trade dis-
counts, and give its customers the advantage of them.
The concern appears to be managed prudently, and
the comparatively small trade it does doesn’t say ihueh
for Brisbane’s practical support of the co-operative
idea it talks such a lot about. That’s, where the
working man goes wrong nine times out of 10 ; he
spends a heap of energy trying to get an extra shil-
ling, but gives scarcely a thought about the wisest
ways of spending the shillings when he gets them.
It’s about time the working man dropped to the fact
that for every shilling the employer robs him of, it
is possible for other people to rob him of a dozen.

The Perkins co.’s capital used to be over £160,000.
That was in the days when Queensland banks were
themselves borrowing so hard that every manager
was provided with a lasso to rope in customers so
that the borrowed money might not be idle in the
vaults. The Perkins co. was naturally lassoed with the
rest; and the money it borrowed was put into hotel
and other property. When Mcßull wanted his money
back there was trouble all round, and the practical
results so far as this co. was concerned was that the
old one disappeared and anew one arrived, with a
capital of £58,333 instead of the old £160,000 odd.
But though Queensland was sober and sorry, it still
had a mouth ; and it soon began drifting up to the
beer pump in much the old way. Then the recon-
structed Perkins co. found that it was in for a good
time; for while the thirst was unimpaired, the profit
that would pay only 10 p.c. to the old co. was cap-
able of paying about 30 p.c. to the new one. For a
time the co. wasn’t extra lavish with divs., and a
handy reserve was built up; and presently £41,667
of this was transferred to capital, bringing the latter
to £IOO,OOO. The present div. (£20,000 plus duty)
is therefore at the rate of 20 p.c. on the capital as
watered. But even 20 p.c. divs. provoke hostile re-
marks from customers nowadays; so, as the co. is in
need of a bit more capital to pay for extensions partly
effected, 44,444 new shares, 15s. paid, are to be
issued at a premium of ss. This will add £33,333
to the capital and £ll,lll to the reserves. The
present holders will have a‘chance to get one new
share for everv three old ones. The directors "do
not think the present dfvtf can be maintained," but
they hope that the new : plant (which is expected to
add' 60 p.c. to the butpu£r~wifr soon “justify them
in making up in bonuses any loss in dividends.’
Then, with a wink —“For other reasons your directors
think it wise to adopt,the above policy at this junc-
ture.” In view of that ivink, what this paper cant
understand is why a premium is to be charged on the
new issue, seeing that the effect of a premium is
always to make the div. seem larger than the share-
holder is actually getting on his capital. Thus a 15
p.c. div on a 15s. share issued at ss. premium is
really only a div. of 11} p.c. That the Perkins div.
should decline somewhat on new capital being called
in, isn’t anything to be puzzled about. It is one
thing to earn 20 p.c. on old assets that were picked
up at the bargain counter of a forced sale, and were
probably worth 100 p.c. more than was paid for
them ; it is quite another thing to earn 20 p.c. on
new assets purchased at a time of unusually high
values. Assuming that 8 p.c. is quite a fair thing
for a shareholder to collect on the new capital (in-
cluding the premium), then a 16 p.c. div. on the in-
creased capital will still give the shareholder within
a shilling or so of 20> p.c. op the old part of the
capital.

In 1900 the stock, book debts and cash were £69,559,
and the co. owed £12,492; net liquid assets were
thus £57,067. The present total of cash, book debts
and stock is £135,911, and the liabilities are
£58,670; net liquid assets, £77,241. So in 12
years liquid assets have been increased by £20,174,
and £71,965 has been added to the book value of
freeholds, plant, etc. A good deal more than that
has been paid for the additions; but the amount
added in excess of £71,965 has been written off
against depreciation. Altogether the present co. has
had a wonderfully fine time—largely, of course,
through getting in at the bargain counter, as before-
mentioned. But competition up north is getting
keener ; in the cupboard there is always the skeleton
of co-operation among the Bungs ; and, finally, there
is the certainty that the pendulum won’t always
swing the way it has been swinging lately in Queens-
land. Unless there has been a most lavish internal
writing off of profits, of which there is no- evidence
whatever, the persistent tendency of visible profits
to shrink in the face of the State’s increasing flush-
ness isn’t any too comforting.

For some years past the capital has been £200,000 ;
but in order, to provide for an extension of factories
and the increase of stocks, another 30,000 £1 shares
were issued during the past year at a small premium.
Even with this -new capital the co. has considerable
liabilities. This shows the position:—

The stock is very heavy; and the declared profit
depends almost entirely upon the way in which that
stock is taken. Ten years ago the directors dis-
covered “undue inflation of values” at various
branches ; and it followed, of course, that the branch
which inflated the value of the unsold stock also
inflated the profit on that part of the stock which
had been sold. And that means (as it did in 1902)
that future real profits must be drawn upon to make
good the previous inflated or bogus profits. This is
the main risk in connection with investment in a
concern which holds big stocks of merchandise:
obviously the investor cannot check the stock-taking,
and has to trust the management entirely. Kemp-
thorne-Prosser’s management certainly has built a
solid reputation for prudence, and its grip on the
drug business of Maoriland appears to be unusually
firm.

The “great natural industries” of the country are a
dreadful gamble, and those that are closest up to
them are a gamble too. Last year the wheat mar-
ket opened very strong. Then the wire-pullers an-
nounced with tremendous energy that 1 the harvest in
Kamtchatka or somewhere had exceeded all expecta-
tions, and the price began to sag; and flour.sagged
too. This sort of thing is apt to hit the country
miller harder than the fellow near the seaport, be-
cause the country miller has to buy early in case
the stuff should be mopped up and sent away to the
coast to await shipment or sale for local consump-
tion. Of course the market doesn’t always go against
the early buyer; hence the big profits shown in some
previous years. Those profits have now and then
been so bloated (in 1902 they exceeded the co.’s en-
tire paid capital) that when a moderate loss is
shown, the directors still hand out a small div. ;
and in a gambling business of this kind there isn’t
much to be said against the payment of what may
be called subsistence money—especially as the lia-
bilities total only £497 and the assets, exclusive of
land, building and plant, amounted, on November
30, to £22,156. Most of this was cash, held no
doubt in readiness for the new season’s buying.

The Freehold Investment and Banking Cos. was a
wild and fuzzy concern, born in the riot of 1892. Be-
fore it was many months old it had accumulated debts
amounting to about £1,300,000, and most of that
respectable sum, along with its own little lot, was
let out on the security of boom-inflated assets. When
the bubble burst, which it did promptly, the mess
was dreadful. The share capital was all gone, and
with it so much of the borrowed capital that when
the present co. was formed the old shareholders were
disregarded altogether, and the old creditors got only
7s. 7d. in the £. This 7s. 7d. was represented by
3s. in shares, 4s. in 4 p.c. debentures, and 7d. trans-
ferred to a reserve account. The valuation on which
things were arranged in that way was made in 1907 ;
and as things improved steadily after that date, a
profit has been made upon the sale of many of the
assets. Part of this profit is included in the first
column ; the balance, representing the profit expected
to be made out of uncompleted transactions, is put
to the credit of a contingency account, which at pre
sent is £17,069 on the right side. This isn't in-
cluded with the reserves shown in the table. The
more or less liquid assets are as follows:
Cash and loans at short call . . . . £40,662
Debentures, bank stock and deposit receipts 25,162
Owing by purchasers .. .. .. 40,347
Mortgages, shares and trifles.. .. .. 22,537
Total £128,708
Debenture and other debt totals £74,364, so there
remains for the shareholders a surplus of £54,344
of more or less liquid assets, plus £61,436 (book
value) of freeholds and leaseholds. If these latter
produce only their book value, the total available for
shareholders will be £115,780, or a trifle over 31s.
for every 20s. of shares. Meantime, pending realisa-
tion, the assets are bringing in a very good return ;
of last year’s profit £3166 came from sales, £1155
from discount on the purchase of the co.’s own deben-
tures, and £4247 net from rents, interest, etc., after
charging against that item all expenses of manage-
ment, etc. It is impossible to tell just what the
shareholders will get out of the wreck; for though
on present appearances there is 31s. in the £of their
written down holdings for them, the properties in hand
may bring in more or less than book value. If the
history of the past few years is any criterion, they
will bring in a trifle more. But it has to be noted
that, as profit in excess of book values is made, some
of it is divided, for, as shown above, last year’s net
revenue from rents, interest and purchase of deben-
tures only amounted to £5402, whereas £6682 was.
divided. This, of course, means that all the profits,
made on sales are not being Saved up for a final dis-
tribution. This gradual distribution, if profits will
tend to limit the final distribution to,something pro-
bably not very much in excess of the 31s. previously-
mentioned. \ % ‘

In 1887 E. T. Smith, who is still patting cricketers
on the head, thought that he was getting old enough
to retire from business; so this co. was formed,, and
it .took over the E. T. Smith and W. K. Simms
beer-factories and spirit-stores as from March 1,
1888. Those were extravagant times, and such a
huge price was paid for goodwill and other more
tangible properties that, though the capital was
£250,000 (in 150,000 shares paid to £1 and
50,000 shares fully paid to £2), the co. began
with a mortgage debt of £150,000, besides other
trifles. Subsequently the mortgage security was
converted into debentures, and the total was increased
to £200,000, at which it still stands. This debt
carries 5 p.c. interest, and the size of it partly
explains why the first column in the table bumps
like an empty motor-car, inasmuch as the profits are
merely what is left after this big bite is taken out,
and the bite is the same, whether times are good or
bad. The accounts never have given the outsider
much of an idea of the real position of the co. The
total of the assets is £558,821, and no less than
£484,695 of that is represented by this one heap—
“ Freehold and leasehold properties, machinery, plant,
rolling-stock, goodwill, etc.” There is no telling
what goodwill alone represents; consequently there
is no telling what part of the capital is represented
by tangible assets. Two years ago the Adelaide
investor, who is a very solid customer, as a rule,
declined to offer more than 245. for the £2 shares
and Bs. 6d. for the £1 paid; but the increased divs.
promptly altered the quotation, and nowadays the
market prices are about £1 19s. and 19s. Still it
is not a Stock which can be recommended to an
investor who likes to sleep soundly. Goodwill is:
merely froth, and there is no telling how much of
that there is in the pot. Also, there is no telling-
how much is represented by pub properties, which
are a doubtful proposition in a State afflicted with
Wowserish tendencies. Already scores of S. Aus.
pubs have been closed, and when a pub property
loses its license it generally loses more than half
its value. For several years past very solid
amounts have been written off for depreciation of
freeholds —principally, no doubt, pub freeholds—and
no man can tell from the accounts what the size of
this sink is. And that is plain in that the visible
profits have been bounding forward during the past
four years ; but it isn't safe to trust to that hurried
movement continuing. For one thing, this co. has
almost a monopoly of the beer business at Broken
Hill, and Broken Hill is a thirsty place, with the
means just at present to buy tanks of beer. But
it is also a place whose prosperity hangs on the
ricketty metal market, and a year or two hence its
beer money may be small and of little consequence.

In a discouraging sort of tone the Boulder
Perseverance (W.A.) Board regrets that the grade of
the ore treated during the past few months has been
below the average, and, on the advice of the chair-
man, who recently visited the mine, it has been de-
cided to put more vigor into development, in the
hope of finding richer ore bodies. The general mana-
ger’s quarterly report concludes: “Proving unex-
plored ground in the lower levels has been the chief
feature of recent work. The Lake View lode at
2200 ft. is scarcely payable, although good values are
occasionally met with, and a slight general improve-
ment is noticeable. Exploratory wbrk on the 100 ft.,
200 ft., 300 ft., 700 ft., 900 ft. and 1900 ft. levels has been
fairly encouraging, especially the El Oro lode, anew
lode west of the Perseverance and a west branch of
the Lake View on the 900 ft. level. The improved
capacity of the treatment plant has been fully main-
tained. Ore reserves have not materially altered.
No further mention is made of the promised divi-
dend.

opened, is reported to have a much better appearance
than anything seen in the last 600 ft. or 800 ft. of
sinking. Anyway, the manager, who has always held
the reputation of knowing something, has written
“ ’Ome” to that effect. * #
Another lot of Yilgarn (W.A.) ventures
has succeeded in getting recommendations ex-
emption from the warden at Southern Cross. These
include the Yilgarn Cos., whose effort to successfully
work the old Never Never leases has been strangled
from the jump for want of capital, one or two dis-
abled Finches, and the somewhat notorious Pine, Hill,
whose funds are now exhausted. The latter s at-
torney stated that £3840 had, in addition to the
£4IOO forked out for the property, been paid out
to date, and £3076 derived from ore treatment had
vanished also. Expenses were, he said, being met
when values gave out, and he believed that if another
£3OOO was spent, the mine would pay. He is an
optimist. This class of mine is only for the most
reckless of market operators, and not for investors
nor even outside speculators.
Kalgurli (W.A.) reports good news from
the western workings at the No. 2 level, where 48ft.
of driving on a biggish body of ore has furnished
good values, ranging from 30dwt. downwards. As in
the case of several other front row mines at Kal-
goorlie, it is to the indifferently prospected upper
workings that the Kalgurli will have to look in the
near future to prop up monthly outputs.
“Oof Bird” (W.A.) : Dear Bulletin.—
Deeply regret to see from a column of scissored boost
sent to me from Sydney that Randolph Bedford has
again had his leg pulled about the real value of the
Bullfinch. On a previous occasion, when the shares
dropped back from 60s. to 305., this obliging optimist
prophesied in print that it would not to a
pound “this year, next year, or the year after,” but
the forecast proved unreliable. Now he aids and
abets the publication of a statement that the parent
show is a stockwork of payable ore, and that in the
northern section anew mine has been discovered.
Now, no estimate is given as to the tonnage of ore
reserves —actual and probable—contained in the afore-
said stockwork, and the meagre amount of work done
so far in the northern section doesn’t justify the be-
lief that anew mine has been found in that part of
the property. Why doesn’t Bedford get Doolette to
explain why no independent report as to ore reserves,
value of developments and prospects of the mine, etc.,
has been put before shareholders to date?

Oroya Exploration has got another six
months’ exemption on the Transvaal at Southern Cross
(W.A.). In support of the application it was stated
that £15,000 had been expended in development, and
£IO,OOO cash and a 5 p.c. share interest had been
paid for the property. The ore was described as
arsenical, and not readily treatable. Additional ex-
emption was wanted, in order to raise more capital
and to determine by further experiments the best
class of plant to instal. Mackey, who, with others,
hung on to the show for some years before
the present owner took it, said that after
spending more money than he was ever likely to get
back, he solved the problem of treating the ore, and
by means of a special furnace produced pure arsenic.
Someone who travelled the world, however, failed to
And a market for the product, and consequently all
his labor and expenditure in that direction, went for
nothing. # #
“Oof,Bird” (W.A.) :(1 )Be Corinthian. It
will want more than the uncorroborated optimism of
Fred Morgan to Convince local speculators that all
the gold he believes there is exists in the mine. Why
not exhibit the other side of the picture by giving the
result of the sampling made by Harry Neal for Djck
Hamilton and Dorrie Doolette? Also, why not make
brief mention of the fact that the show is on the
same line as the old Hope’s Hill, and after giving a
resume of that mine’s career, let the public decide
for themselves? (2) Re the Great Unknown and
“Pegmatite.” This mine is what I said it was a
rich little thing, without any apparent hope of per-
manency at depth. The original syndicate included
Randolph Bedford and Gerald Williams, but they
sold out to Charlie Jones, who, with Dorrie Doolette,
now hold about a three-fourths interest. The local
newspaper proprietor and two publicans are the
others interested. #
Up to the 'end of March the gold divi-
dends distributed in the West totalled £22,359,206,

hoe £2,858,750; Oroya- Browhhill (now part of the

Two experts, accompanied by Carr Boyd
Mud provisions, have gone out from Laverton (W.A.),
to have a look at Whitford’s Reward. This is the
property which boomed a few years ago on the
strength of Whitford’s optimistic report, and which
Vndrew Wilson blew out on making an inspection.
The public is solemnly warned against having any-
thing further to do with it.

The Vegetable Creek Tin Mine, Emrna-
ville (N.S.W.), has put up a fine performance during
the last 12 months, in managing to struggle along
without the aid of calls. A little over a year ago the
co. reached the rocky stage of having to raise capital
to pay its debts. Starting under fresh auspices,
with scanty cash reserves and wash reserves abso-
lutely nil, the mine has managed to hump a killing
weight of royalty, and at the same time pursue a
vigorous development policy. An up-to-date plant has
been installed, and a handy reserve of wash locked
away Doubtless the price of tin has been largely
responsible, but it must be a good mine all the same.
In addition to ordinary working expenses, a 25 pm.
royalty on the gross value of the output has to be
paid. The new Chandler’s shaft has been sunk, and
an expensive crosscut driven to the lead. This prac-
tically completes the heavy dead work likely to be
needed for some considerable time, and at the same time
provides two fresh leading drives to supplement the
solitary one that has managed so far to keep its pot
boiling. The property, with its miles of lead, is
practically only scratched, and even if the rest doesn t
all come up to expectations, there is a fairly liberal
margin of allowance.
Another deep-lead proposition in the same district
will shortly be placed before the public. This is the
lower portion of the Graveyard lead, on the upper
end of which the Y-Water Cos. is at present operating.
Numerous shafts have fairly well prospected this
lower ground, and have proved the existence of tribu-
tary leads, all of which are tin-bearing. Chief ot
these is the Daly’s, from which wash has been taken,
averaging 2ewt. of tin oxide per cubic yard. The
length of this lead is about two miles. The Grave-
yard where worked has shown a minimum width ot
one chain, carrying a continuous body of wash 4ft.
deep, averaging a hundredweight stream tin per
cubic yard. Lack of capital, it is stated, has pre-
vented vigorous exploitation, and though this is an
old yarn, the earlv history of the Vegetable Creek
lead lends an air of possibility. However, there must
have been some other reason for their abandonment,
and this probably was the occurrence of poor patches
at a time when tin was only £4O a ton. The \ ege-
table Creek has manv such patches, interspersed with
bodies of phenomenal richness, concentrated into the
softer hollows of the clay-stone bottom. The bottom
of these other leads is in granite, which is undoubt-
edly the source of the tin. This being so, there is
every probability of fresh wash being discovered,
especially where the tributaries junction with the
main lead. Asa moderate expenditure will open up
the property fairly well, the venture is an attractive
gamble. The compensation to the owners of the land
is 2J p.c. royalty.

The shareholders of the New Eldorado
Gold Mining Cos. (N.S.W.) have before them a re-
commendation from their directors for an amalgama-
tion with the neighboring Mount Drysdale. Although
the latter doesn’t seem to have any ore worth
mentioning in sight, the Eldorado, without an amal-
gamation, will need anew shaft, and practically a
new plant. Both these cos. have been having an
unhappy time of late years, and no work has been
carried out at the mines for many months. In ad-
dition to the directors going hungry, they have had
to give their personal guarantee for the bank over-
drafts. The suspension of labor conditions will
expire at the end of May. The £5061 deficit brought
forward from the previous year by the Eldorado was
increased to £5484. Outstanding calls total £l6B,
against liabilities £1628. Other assets practically
nil. *
The English-owned Lucknow mines
(N.S.W.) have been sold to a local syndicate. The
purchasers state that it is their intention to unwater
the mines for a re-examination. Possibly they may
see their profit on the surface, from the sale of the
agricultural portion of the land. The early records
of these mines would undoubtedly impart to any
prospectus a gorgeousness of dazzling possibilities,
provided there wasn’t too much mention about later
developments. Ore bodies up to 10ft. wide
and 50ft. long have yielded an average ot
50oz. of gold per ton, while specimens have
assayed several thousand ounces per ton. So
that, in the good old days, the yields ot
gold bullion ran into a matter of tons. But deeper
developments didn’t come up to the scratch. At the
best of times the ore bodies used to be as hard to
pick as the pea under the thimble. Over-capitalisa-
tion certainly helped to kill the mine, as even a
yield of 224,7040 z. gold from 106,500 tons ot ore
couldn’t keep things going. This was during the
eight years after the formation of the Wentworth
Goldfields Proprietary, in 1890, and the subsidiary
Aladdin’s Lamp in 1892, the combined capital of
which was £600,000, and area 1061 acres.

The current year should see an increased
output of copper from the Grafton mine at Cangai
(N.S.W.). Only a few days since a consignment ot
“metal” worth £4OOO was shipped. The product
referred to as metal is high-grade copper matte,
carrying from 60 to 70 p.c. of copper. The Grafton
hasn’t got a converter, and doesn’t turn out copper
bullion. „ .
* * * *
For the first quarter of this year Great
Cobar (N.S.W.) produced 1523 tons of copper, con-
taining 83500 z. gold and 54,2340 z. silver. Value
(with copper at £6O) was roughly £122,892. At
£7O the value would be' £138,122. Output for
March was: Copper,-576 tons; gold, 39200 z.; silver,
23,7160 z., so the month’s return is quite as remark-
able for the heavy production of precious metals as
for the increase in copper. For the three months
precious metals gave £31,512, or rather more than
25 p.c. of the total value produced. The last official
quarterly return shows that the average copper values
were down to 1.89 p.c. for 73,037 tons of ore treated.
Evidently on that grade the gold and silver values
require to be high. Gold contents in previous quar-
terly returns have never been so high as they were
during the first three months of this year. The
silver return is erratic. February gave 13,7670 z.,
but March came along with 23,7160 z.
The Silverspur mine, near Bananaland’s
southern fence, made a creditable score last year.
From 7320 tons smelted, it got back silver £12,525,
gold £1892, copper £2916, and lead £917, a total
of £18,250. The co. is intent on indenting: a pro-
cess from the land of the unstable Taft, whereby
it hopes to catch the zinc that has been capering
up the stack. Very little development work was
done, and the diamond drill from 300 ft. level didn’t
give any results worth writing about. The old fur-
nace is being rebuilt. (The manager estimates that
it absorbed £IO,OOO worth of matte, and that he is
going to reclaim it.) Meanwhile a small reverbera-
tory furnace is ready to do the old ’un’s job when
there is something to do. But until the recent rain,
the mine was closed pending the arrival of some
sky-juice, to enable teams to replenish the fuel.
Cliillagoe, for a run of four weeks to
March 31, treated 5419 tons of ore for Copper, 278
tons; lead, 277 tons; silver, 29,9440 z.; gold 3690 z.
The railway receipts for the financial year (closed
March 31) were £95,279, showing a decline of
£21,227, compared with the previous year. The
profit from the railway has pulled Chillagoe through.
The line is at the top of the coast range, and was
cheaply constructed. Expenses are cut to the bone,
and this has enabled the co. of late years to make
enough profit out of its line to pay debenture interest
and other expenses. It is a case where the Govern-
ment railway does the climbing, and the private line
on top of the range reaps the benefit.
Another mining engineer gives his views of
Mt. Oxide: “Now that the stopper has come out of
the Mount Oxide Options’ bottle, the odor arising
therefrom is strongly reminiscent of the Bullfinch
smell. The present company was formed only a few
weeks ago, in 1000 shares of £lO each, to develop the
mine and find the purchase price of £IOO,OOO. The
utmost publicity has been given to operations, and
glowing accounts forwarded of rich ore discovered by
recent developments. What these are may be judged
by a telegram from the manager shortly after arriv-
ing there, that owing to wet weather he had to send
the men underground. Now, the richness of this pro-
perty is not anew thing, for the mine has lain in
a very nicely opened-up state for many years. What
can be the use of tinkering about at the surface and
at those places where rich ore is already known to
exist? What is wanted to be known is—Can the pro-
perty justifiably stand capitalisation, which must be
heavy if it is touched at all? At least a quarter of
a million will have to be sunk before the mine can
be properly put on the producing stage. The signi-
ficance of the tin-pot developing (?) of the last six
weeks begins to show up when one reads that the in-
dependent mining expert (who is a good man) is now
on his way north, to add his report to the list
already available. Still more significant is the un-
heralded fact that accompanying him is a certain
well-known scribe, whose association with the
Chaffinch mystery is not yet forgotten. But before
the report is out the time is judged ripe to float a
new company, to be known as the Mount Oxide
Mines and Railways, Ltd. (Limited, to be noticed),
with a capital of £400,000, in 800,000 shares of
10s. each. Of these, 175,000 are to be offered
locally, payable 2s. on application, 2s. on allotment,
and the balance in three months; 175,000 shares are
reserved for public issue in Great Britain (how,
when, and where not stated) ; 250,000 shares of 10s.
each, credited as fully paid up, together with the
cash consideration (also not stated), are to be
handed to the vendors and promoters in consideration
of the mine, leases, options, and for their underwrit-
ing present issue. Underwriting commission, 5 p.c.
payable in cash, 10 p.c. payable in fully-paid shares.
The other 200,000 shares are held in reserve, subject
to options hereinafter not set forth. Three well-
known investors will join the Board after allotment,
but their names are wisely withheld. There is no
mention of any existing contracts, and what is
wanted to be known is—What do the vendors give in
return for their 250,000 shares? The owner of the
mine has not to be paid for several months to come,
and who pays him? The total liability of the pre-
sent promoters is only £10,000.”
* * * *
Charters Towers has not been doing too
well lately. For the first quarter the total revenue
was only £91,681, from 34,505 tons of stone, tail-
ings, and various small parcels of base minerals.
Dividends were £11,375, but calls mopped up
£16,748. Mills’ United, New Brilliant Freehold
and East Mexican have been crushing lower-grade
stone, and the Brilliant Extended has been off-color.
Its return last month was 2980 tons for £3160.
Cyaniding of tailings give £llO3. Total, £4263,
involving a loss of £1444. An extensive shoot of
stone has been proved in the eastern levels, but it is
patchy. The workings extend from No. 4 down to
No. 20 (2800 ft. vertical).
Kelly’s Queen Block (Charters Towers)
crushed 454 tons from the cross-reef stopes (above
and below 1450 ft.) for £2206 155., and 112£ tons
from the St. George reef (657 ft. level), which gave
£565. The return from the cross-reef is consider-
ably below the average value obtained from the stone
previously raised. Still, it should give a fair profit.
The return from the St. George reef—about £5 per
t on —is encouraging, because the stone has been ob-
tained in development work.
As told by one of the directors at the
annual picnic, the Scottish Gympie (Q.) has, since
the start, produced nearly 13 tons of gold. The exact
quantity is 422,8510 z., valued at £1,493,798, from
953,354 tons of stone, an average of 31s. per ton.
This is a much better average grade than is obtained
at present, and helps to explain how it is that the
Scottish has paid £535,867 in dividends. Last year
the Scottish treated 81,800 tons for 21,3740 z. gold,
and paid four dividends of ltd. on 660,000 shares
£16,500 for the year. The Scottish has spared no ex-
pense in adding to and improving its plant, which has
cost £86,205. It has in hand some new air-compressing
machinery, that will cost from £7OOO to £8000; a
railway siding, costing £1569, is the latest item, and
indicates that the Scottish has confidence in itself.
Still a sdwt. proposition requires to cut costs below
17s. per ton, even if the 17s. includes office expenses.
Great Fitzroy (Q.) has had its water
supply replenished, and, as soon as the miners and
smelter hands can be engaged, will commence another
smelting campaign. If the copper market holds
good at £7O, a 2i p.c. extraction figures 355. gross
per ton of ore. That value, irrespective of 10s
worth of gold, seems a reasonable proposition. A
doubt;'however, hangs over the possibility of obtain-
ing' 200 tons of fine copper from 8000 tons of ore it
the variable concentrating process is depended on.
Backers of Mount Elliott copper (Q.)
show no timidity in making big estimates of profit
for the current financial year, which ends
1912 But loss of time, a reduced output and heavy
expenses attending the creep in the mine have to
be reckoned with. To counterbalance this Elliott had
£130,469 worth of lister copper on hand, or on the
wav to market on June 30, 1911, and this stock
added to the production since September will enable
the co. to benefit by the rapid rise m the price of
electrolytic copper. I-low much metal Jill realise
£7O we cannot say, but the shipments of blister to
Europe have been, heavier since the copper market
improved. * *

Now that Alec Peacock is out of office, he
could worse than seek to wheedle some capital
into the old CJunes(yic.).district. Everyone so far has
wanted Bull to put unwater tite

having to part with a big wad of paid-up scrip to

little or no mining below 800 ft. Here are a few of

And so on until the total of £5,498,346 is reached.
Most of this gold came from following rich shoots
and to the neglect of a lot of the poorer dirt in the
upper levels. This ought to be get-at-able without
any drastic cutting into cash resources. With cheap
pumping plant available from some of the defunct
deep lead shows, the water could be got down. Peter
Mcßride talks about giving £50,000 to help Bendigo.
Now, if Alec Peacock wants to do his duty to his
district, he ought to induce Peter to give a tenth
of that sum to Clunes, on the pound to pound prin-
ciple, with a view to re-awakening that deserted
centre.
Because a market willy willy struck North
Nuggetty, Daylesford, the other day, the usual tools
are calling out for the Government to shoot some-
one. What is the history of the field? Patches m
the old days, and a mass of uncertainties m these.
The balmy folk who chattered prospective dividends
at the North Nuggetty never measured up the re-
serves, and never clamored for the clever lot to insist
on that being done. They hung on to shares when
the right to inspect was shackled. They filled tbeir
silly noodles with dreams, when scrip went to £4,
that another 80s. was to fall in their palms. As
usual, Ballarat dealers shouted quickest once they
knew that the start was on. What happened was a
pinching of the big flat make, due to a sandstone in-
trusion at No. 4, and the widening of the horrid sus-
picion that 80s. wasn’t in sight on the mine. the
story that the gold has got into the vertical shoots
of stone is now passed by, though more improbable
things than that happen in mining. The crash is
as with British —an overbought market and weak
holders- —without the real backing that British hap-
pens to have. The same thing happened over Ajax,
a few yards to the north, and in the Nuggetty on
the boundary to the south. Over-buying and tall
talk put Ajax shares to £B, and Nuggetty was
boosted the same way. Now that the third example
has come, North Nuggetty may flutter down to under
the 40’s, and so to about the right level.
“Will the undertaking pav ?” The economical
handling and trans]>ort of ores, fluxes, coal, coke,
merchandise, etc., in or about mines, factories or
warehouses, very often solves the problem. W. anti
J. Lempriere, of Melbourne, as agents for Bleiehert
arid Co., can give useful information on this subject.
The Bleichert firm has several aerial ropeways worlt-
irg in Australia, or in course of erection, ant. will
soon have at work, near Sydney, one of the largest
electric “Telpher” plants in existence. Special
electric and other cranes and mono-rail conveyors
can be procured from the same firm.*

The Bigelow Patent Rock Breaker commends itself
to mine managers who welcome an effective machine
which is cheaper to maintain and repair than Gyra-
tory and other crushers. This machine is of the
weil-known Blake type, but has some additional im-
provements which have justified in practice all the
claims advanced by the patentee. The work of the
crushing is done on the down stroke of the pitman
instead of the up stroke; there is no strain on the
pitman cap ; two large side rods resist the thrust of
the toggles, and enable the jaws to be regulated
within a large range; the back toggle is so made
as to resist all legitimate strains of crushing, but will
shear under exceptional conditions and save the
machine. The Austral Otis Engineering Company,
of South Melbourne, have installed a great number
of these machines, and hold the sole manufacturing
rights for the Commonwealth.* [1

When tea was first introduced
into Europe, about a couple of
hundred years ago anyhow,
long before my time it was
sold in chemist’s shops, and was
thought to be a cure for every-
thing from a broken leg to a
pimple on one’s nose—of course,
they didn’t know much about
tea then —to-day, however, it is
thoroughly well known as the
nicest and the most wholesome
of all beverages —it stimulates
and brightens one up without
causing the slightest after ill-
effect, and 1 know of nothing in
my shop that 1 can say the same
thing of.
Chemists are great tea drinkers
—1 suppose it’s because we’ve
always got to have our wits about
us, and because we know there’s
nothing nicer or better that we
can drink. In my own home we
always use the R obur No. J
Grade, and very nice tea it
is—it has a delightful flavour,
and gives us great satisfaction.

WOMAN'S
LITTER
Sydney, APkijl 15, 1912.
My Dear Aeini, —
A man from Thursday Island dropped off
his favorite coral reef into this office the
other morning. He is one of the first batch
of aldermen in that tropic rock, which de-
veloped into a municipality last January, and
has had to sleep under a palm tree ever
since because its head won’t go through the
doorway. It is a real, full-grown munici-
pality, with an Inspector of Decayed Croco-
diles (who answers to the Ordinary Inspec-
tor of Nuisances), a regulation about the
quality of the milk in the cocoanut, and an-
other to deal with the furious driving of
cyclones, and a Clerk of Petty Gibberish on
account of the many languages. Alderman
Douglas (which is Scotch) Riley (which is
Irish —the combination vaguely suggests the
story of Alexander Solomon, which I will
tell you another time), who has been han-
dling big business affairs in the North for
about ll years, is another rock thrown in
the face of the Black Australia obsession.
He is one of the finest specimens of Aus-
tralian bone and muscle, well tanned, that
Sydney saw during Show week. The Thurs-
day Island man, speaking in a voice that is
6ft. up in the air, is worth hearing. “I don’t
say that the tropics, without exits to the
hill country, agree too well with white
women and children, but any man who regu-
lates his life and diet to suit the climate
can keep himself in good fettle. I’ve had 11
years up north, so I ought to know.”
The Thursday Island rainfall, which usu-
ally comes down suddenly in blocks (the
average annual deluge is about Bft.), de-
layed its arrival this season. The matter is
being inquired into, and it has been warned
that it must be more punctual in future, or
it will Ipse its job. Douglas Riley doesn’t
leave the mosquito a rag of reputation large
enough to wrap round its head when its
miserable old tooth aches. “They’re only
just beginning to understand the depravity
of a Thursday Island mosquito,” remarks
the new coral reef alderman. “A noted
S’Australian authority says, ‘Exterminate
the pest, and you’ll find the dysentery scourge
will follow the hum of his evening song.’ In
1911 we had only 4000 points—half our
usual share. Then came the midsummer
water famine, when the town had to share
the barracks supply. The Government
people, by the way, don’t understand the
Island pest. If they did, they’d put mos-
quito-proof wire round the verandahs of the
new regimental buildings.”
The new Thursday Island council has a
real life Mayor Hayne. The first results of
Home Rule for the Mosquito-bitten Isle
will be a huge reservoir to trap the rainfall
at a cost of £13,000.
Governor Chelmsford’s evening party, last
week, plunged the brand-new Gentleman
Help, Keith Lees, into a fit of nervous de-
lirium. He’s a juvenile baronet, of clean
and unpretentious appearance, with pink
cheeks and nice manners. Suddenly over-
come with the naming of a serried
phalanx of the Best-dressed, he loit-
ered in a quiet by-way outside the
ball-room, and lured arrivals, one by
one, to give up their front and hinder
nomenclature. He turned the results twice
over in his mouth in a hurried whisper, then
passed it on (in confidence), to Aide de
Moleyns, who toiled, in _ the sweat of his
brow and the top of his lung power, to
brand each stranger with the right tag.
Hostess Lady Chelmsford wore a great
flower tucked into the waist of her elegant
glint of primrose and white. The new sar-
torial tail grows near the shoulder blades,
and falls to the hem of the skirt (or its
neighborhood) with a Julius Aurelius Roman
toga twirl. Generally speaking, it is built
of filmy drapery. Lady C. wore a vossamer
Marcus J. Aurelius tail, and Miss Quirk
tossed her head above a graceful Niagara
of claret-colored ninon. The slender reed-
like length of the Viscountess Massareene
(one title’s enough at a time, so I’m going
to heave “Ferrard” into the lost property
cupboard) was crowned with a Queen of
Sheba diadem of gold with a vast deck-
load of emeralds. In a heavy sea she would
have certainly capsized with all hands, her
large, generous heart and her wealth of
gems not being counterbalanced with a suffi-
cient ballast of feet. Her gown of floral
brocade had a huge wallpaper pattern
twining round her attenuated form.
The G.-G. Denmans, with their variegated
staff and extensive house party, glittered
with gems, orders, etc., and paced through
the ballroom in the usual neck-and-neck
race. Melba darted out of this splendor to
have a word with a friend. Speaker Willis
meandered round the Chelmsford party with
the calm appearance of a well-behaved ice-
berg, and politician Wood floated peacefully
through an adjacent door. This time the
Speaker didn’t order his removal. Mrs.
Trefle mothered a sister (Mrs. Shelley)
from Tasman’s Isle. And a great concourse
or skin and bone (the willowy figure haying
its bad moments when it bares its chest)
chattered softly of nothing important till
about eleven of the clock.
The calling of the cabs, carriages and
motors after the Chelmsford party was as
hopeless as shrieking the numbers of the
stars, or demanding the immediate appear-
ance of Halley’s Comet. Nothing came.
Then did Aide de Moleyns dash into the
night, and lift up his voice to stir the echoes
round Rose Bay. After a loud pause, wheels
crunched the red gravel under the glare of
Chinese lanterns, but they were mostly the
wrong tyres, the right ones presumably form-
ing a petrol tail round the edge of the dis-
tant. bay. “Mrs. Griffith’s carriage,” bawled
a distracted official. When he’d cried it
aloud to. the heavens about 10 times, the
legal knight stepped forth, and remarked:
"Lady Griffith!” in italics. A bystander
says he’d have the wheels rounded up for
identification, and let the person who owned
them get away promptly, and not block the
dewy night with mere handles.
The G.-G. Denmans’ garden party followed
the rule of the road instituted at their first
flower burst in the spring. Instead of being
herded outside a closed gate (the Dudley
scheme) till the exact moment arrived when
the hinges creaked and the gates of Paradise
fell back, and revealed the bowers of As-
phodel, the mere crowd steered its course
through the haven of the ball-room. Knee
bobs, curtsies and other salaams, were
gathered together on the verandah. Then
the kangaroos, top-dressed in their best
smiles, shook the vice-regal hand, sometimes
called a salary-hook. It was the frockiest
assemblage of the week, and a day of days
for a party trimmed with gorgeous flower
beds, under a dome of cerulean blue. Bri-
tain’s grey hulls of war lurked in the fore-
ground of Farm Cove, and stuck snub noses
into the golden atmosphere.
Chamberlain Nevill conducted the names
through the right channel. Most of the
staff was in uniform, and spiked the air with
a red feather apiece, at an altitude of seven
feet, or thereabouts. Melba got away early
from the glacial fag of being vice-regal, and
camped in a shady nook with John Lemmone
and his wife, Hugh Ward, and J.C.W. Ltd.
Grey clamors for a good complexion to
stand its muddy reflex. There were clouds
of dove-colored ladies at the garden party.
I fancy the fine bloom of Mrs. Steer Bow-
ker’s unassisted complexion came out of the
racket of smoked drapery better than most.
Mrs. W. G. M’Arthur challenged the eye, in
a three-decker toque built of violets. A
posy of the same sat securely in the waist-
belt of her black frock. Mrs. John Toohey
sailed across the lawn, with a wing-like
cloak outspread to catch the lost breeze.
Mrs. G. Lane Mullins and Mrs. W. T. Collins
shook their handsome plumage on the lower
lawn, where the Government House party
tried to swallow a four o’clock snack, under
the concentrated glance of about 600 eyes.
Matthew Henry Stephen, though still
fairly evergreen, begins to show signs of
being more than 20. His slim form and
ascetic figurehead took one end of the Den-
man’s State tea-table. Archbishop Wright
curled his gaitered legs under the same
sacred trestle board. The veteran Dr. James
Cox showed his. still sturdy frame at this
revel. Mrs. David Maughan, with something
white veiled, in something black, and a great
purple bow in the middle of her back, was a
bright-eyed young matron frequently sur-
rounded by the parental Edmund Bartons.
One garden party being much like any other
riot of the same kind, nearly every religion
known since the fall of the apple was pre-
sent. Priest, parson and rabbi breathed
the. same air,. and showed the same healthy
desire to assimilate nourishment with en-
thusiasm.
Governor Fuller (Yic.) and his tall and
pretty dame had a rapid sprint through
Sydney’s most exclusive ham and chicken
fights last week. She is obviously designed
to be a popular person, and her sweet and
friendly manner to all comers at the Chelms-
ford revel recalled the charm of Lady Raw-
son’s personal attention to the vice-regal
business.
A gentle bite from the frozen Pole wan-
dered across the fourth race day at Rand-
wick. It lent a frosty nose to many of
those present, and nearly dragged large col-
onies of ostrich plumes up by the roots. The
G.-G. Denmans inhabited the vice-regal pen
at regular intervals, and a side-view gave
a moving-picture show of upstanding fluff
tottering .in the breeze. Lady Denman’s
good-looking, ostrich-feathered hat was in
the first flight. Melba sticks to the egret’s
tail with the whole-hearted determination
that marks everything she takes in hand, and
the osprey generally shakes its anguished
spikes, by day or night, over her capable
head. The men in the G.-G.’s train had
simmered down to sac suits and nondescript
headgear, and might have been mistaken for
bookmakers’ clerks or other useful members
of society.
Mrs. Gordon Wesche, very well turned out
in smoke grey; Miss Gladys Bowker, in one
of . the newest distractions in striped tailor-
built tweed; Miss Laidley. in another of the
tweed suits, with a fleck of blue in its grey
body; Miss Etta Norris, blue-eyed, with
gown en suite; the tall Anderson belles, who
are drifting rather close to the lean side of
slender, and the Russell Clarke duet, from
Melbourne, also side-stepped the horse on
Saturday. Mother-in-law Douglas Macken-
zie, whose quiver of daughters mostly mar-
ried money, descended in great majesty on
this city last week, in the offing of Mrs.
Russell.
The Madden family made its bi-annual
descent on this city’s most expensive enter-
tainments last week. Two-thirds of the tribe
have taken more or less permanent root in
New South W. The Madden niece, Mrs.
Anthony Hordern, added a small daughter
to the Cornstalk population during the
Easter stampede of knaves, knights, horns
and hoofs, through Sydney’s water front.
Mrs. Pat Osborne glided through the social
riots in filmy draperies, with a “God-save-
the-Queen” expression about her back hair,
which shows \ictorian coinage curls dan-
gling in a loose bob behind.
The new bride, Mrs. Baillieu, another
sprig of the John Madden clan, aired her
trousseau at the autumn dress parade. At
Governor Chelmsford’s party, she wore the
traditional white bridal gear, with a wisp of
tulle tucked into the creases of her coiffure.
Dame John mothered her married brood on
the same occasion, in the most eye-racking
shade of blue velvet that was ever reached
down out of the sky from the top of the
tallest sky-scraper.
Mrs. Dick Horsfall (who used to be Miss
Fosbery) was easily the best-dressed woman
at the races on Saturday. She puts on her
clothes (a black velvet coat and skirt, and
biscuit-colored hat of the fat, all-round
species, was her Steeplechase Day climax)
with an air or a dash or something not given
to ordinary tourists through this vale of
years. If the Horsfall wool suddenly fell
below zero, I believe Mrs. Dick could drape
herself in the butt-ends of cheques, and make
paper frills lead the way as the last gasp
of style.
The Russell girls, Ethel and Enid, pat-
tered off the Orama on to the vice-regal
lawn last Friday. They’ve been inspecting
the Pyramids, the Sphinx and other well-
known identities in Egypt, with a look-in
at London’s mighty uproar. Parent H. G.
Russell was in charge of the expedition, and
with the trippers went the Downer Dame
(Adelaide) and her year-old infant —a de-
termined sightseer. Ethel, 8.A., will hurry
back to the white walls of Cairo in Novem-
ber to marry Chief-Engineer Samuel G.
Britain, of the railway in those sandy parts.
The Aurora sidled up to a long strip of
wharf near Miller’s Point, just before the
Horse and Beef Show overflowed this city.
She’s built of oak, and has a long, inquisitive
nose, and ft thick waist, and a steep crevasse
in her inside. This is her cabin, where
members of the Mawson expedition to the
slippery South Pole wore frozen eyelashes,
and icicles on their breath when the weather
was extra nippy. The Antarctic oak chest
collected a little coin for self and the Sea-
man’s Mission, by throwing open to the
public eye a carefully-selected exhibit of
sleeping-bag, nose-bag, snow slippers and
other comforts.
Bo’sun Peers, on the deck of the Aurora,
rubbed the nose of a panting Esquimau
dog, and named it as one of the best of its
tribe. As a midnight howler it was also up
to schedule time. Its mate, furiously sweat-
ing under a Sydney sun, licked its jaws and
looked its friend in the teeth. "Will they
fight?” repeated the bo’sun. “I’ll give them
a second to dust the deck.” Two infuriated
masses of dog writhed together in a white
heat of passion that exuded all the battle-
spirit of all the ages. A subterranean
growl, and a wolfish glare were mixed up in
this scrap, which threatened to exterminate
one combatant, or any stray member of the
Peace Society who happened to fall out of a
passing aeroplane. “They haven’t begun
yet—not properly,” chipped in the bo’sun,
coolly tearing the pugilists into two whole
sections of raging beast and chaining them
apart in a welter of deferred bite.
Emily Soldene, who fondly loved the world
and its flesh-pots, has had to leave them
behind, and journey on to the unknown ad-
ventures of the Styx ferry. The Soldene
style of handling a pen was rare in modern
journalism. She wrote as she talked, with-
out the trivial aid of the hard-worked
comma. Her punctuation was nil, and her
scorn for Lindiey Murray and the higher
proprieties of proper nouns never got
off its original track. An occasional bliz-
zard of capital letters, then a drought of the
same, marked her distracting copy, which
looked as if an able-bodied spider had walked
through an inkpot, then wiped himself dry
on innumerable pages of MS. It had to be
industriously edited and sub-edited. Its
jokes were re-dressed in language that re-
tained the original spicy flavor, without in-
citing Mrs. Grundy to shriek for help. It
was the Sydney Evening News which dis-
covered the possibilities of a weekly letter
from the ex-star, Avhose personality had once
raised an inferior London music-hall to
greatness, and brought half the peerage out
of its usual track to worship at the shrine
of Soldene’s silk tights.
Emily, whose wit was always at boiling
point, left Sydney for a trip to Fogland
about 12 years ago. It fell to my lot, as a
fairly raw beginner, to succeed her on the
News. I couldn’t take her place. The
fourth estate has probably no facsimile of
the maddening copy and cheerful originality
and short, sudden barks of Soldene’s sen-
tences. She suggested Alfred Jingle, edited
by a kangaroo. She ambled back after a
year or so on the other side, intending to
wave her pen once more at this end. Just
then, the bubonic rat was cutting his teeth
as a public nuisance in Sydney. Soldene’s
horror of the plague germ grew into
a shudder, then into a panic, and
finally into a flying pair of heels. She
bolted in a fortnight, by the liner that
brought her out. I can see her now as she
looked a day or two before her flight—a
kindly, worldly old Bohemian, in a very
tight black satin dress, with protesting
hooks teariflg away from their moorings
across her capacious bust. A frivolous bon-
net, full of nodding plumes, blocked the
horizon as she breathed hearty words of
cheer into my front hair. Her large streak
of good nature helped many a lame puppy
over a boulder, and she boiled down Society
till all the fat rose to the surface.
Melba rose before the morning milk
foamed on the window sill of Government
House, the other day, and hurried off to the
Spit. The Marich week-end camp flaps its
sides near that sandy tongue, and the pur-
pose of this early flight up Middle Harbor
was the same which used to drag Isaak
Walton from his untimely bed. Nine mur-
dered bream wallowed in their gore while
the dawn blushed in the east, and some other
fish escaped narrowly from the song of the
charmer and fled by the skin of their teeth.
The Mummers’ Day at the Hospice Fete
shook the air with loud noises one afternoon
last week. A surging crowd chased “star”
entertainments behind barricades of striped
ticking, and cheerfully parted with extra
coins to see Leslie Holland’s swimming
match—a safety match floating on its back
in a bath ; or hear the “Bernanza Banoona”
of Fred Leslie rend his sack and escape
(“like his father before him”) from cap-
tivity. Locks of Cleopatra’s hair were
thrown in for the 6d. entrance fee. Every-
thing has not been said about the frivolous
Lady of Old Guile, for Fred Leslie’s consign-
ment of Cleopatra’s curls had grown on bales
of white cotton wool.
“The Squatter’s Daughter,” now drawing
to the end of her ride across the Palace
Theatre stage, has been a Mascotte for the
Bert Bailey-Grant management. Last week’s
takings alone would gladden the till of any
mummer’s shop in this city. How a very
wet waterfall contrived to fall over rocky
boulders in the middle of a eucalyptus gorge,
and how Mary Marlowe contrived to ride
her nag across’ the limitations of the Palace
stage without walking into the orchestra,
was a mystery to me. So I went behind to
have a back view of the Shearers’ Rest and
the bushranging billy, the other nig;ht. Sarah
Lynch (Lilias Adeson) was slaking her
thirst on the dry side of the cataract with a
tall glass of water, the curtain being well
down in front. This pun ought to make
Theodore Hook shiver in his grave. Hero
Guy Hastings was hunting for a nice, cool
air-shaft—the labors of saving a heroine 14
times running (there or thereabouts) giving
a temperature of llOdeg. in the shade. Mary
Marlowe was combing out her long black
locks (they’re indigenous to the soil), and
preparing to live happily ever after in the
fourth act. And Julius Grant was walking
round the back view of his torrent with the
smile of a man who has just tripped over a
bag of gold. The Horse had retired to his
dressing-room to have his final snack and
clean his teeth.
Sitting on the weary tail of the festive
season,
I subscribe myself,
VANDORIAN.

MELBOURNE CHATTER
Melbourne, April 15, 1912.
My Dear Yarrie,—
Mrs. Jack Winter Irving, of the Western
District wool clan, is in town helping sister
Rita Petley,. who is about to marry Jack
Watson, also of the squattocracy. The two
are daughters of old Major Petley, who fin-
ished his days in retirement at Brighton.
The romance of a planned elopement evap-
orated when practical common-sense was
applied. The girl, daughter of a wealthy
squatter, fell in love with the gentleman
who shoved Dad’s motor, and the pair made
preparations for a bolt in the dark.
Mamma somehow heard of it, and induced
Dad to give his blessing and a grant of
land. Then she prepared a wedding feast —
and the subsequent proceedings were on
strictly orthodox lines. The pair are now
prosaically settled down within shout of the
old homestead.
A craze has set in amongst women to
shove their own motor-cars, and the petrol
tutor’s lot seems to be correspondingly hap-
pier. In Collins-street, the other afternoon,
a nice girl who steers in the highest social
circles was observed piloting her own
machine. Her instructor —a nice, large man
—had his arms on either side of her and his
two big fists were laid tenderly over her
dear little hands on the rim of the steering
wheel.
Mi’s. O’Brien, widow of the rich Pat of
Hawthorn, died the other day at Kensington
Gardens, London. She was one of the three
handsome Hayes sisters who led Melbourne
society in the old days. Their uncle was
the dashing Father Hayes, parish priest of
St. Francis’, a Melbourne Club man and
close chum of the Power brothers.
The tall, dark-eyed fiancee of a politician
with Labor leanings has cancelled the en-
gagement, and decided to become the bride
of the Church.
Dr. Schachner, the German scientist who
last year published a book about Australia,
died the other day in the Fatherland. He
married Kate Gair, one of the Brough-Flem-
ming local finds, and they were comfortably
settled at Jena, near the University.
The Mr. R. J. Flatau, who is starred in
all our dailies as “late of the Daily Mail,”
and now “travelling representative of the
Times, with a commission to inquire into
the state of the Australian labor market,”
is the aquiline-featured lad who recently
married heiress Norma McMeikan. His
father is a mining expert in Sydney, and
there the enterprising Rex was born, and
lived till quite recently.
Judge Chomley’s daughter—the one who
delights to secretary charitable episodes in
the fashionable world —is back from London,
politically primed, and ready to do battle for
the Women’s National League. When she
departed last year, her many women friends
threw a purse of sovereigns into her lap for
holiday expenses. Toiling for a gilt-edged
league has its compensations.
Squatter Mills’s girl, who is raiding the
shops in search of wedding finery, is ponder-
ing over a relationship tangle. Her future
husband, Mr. Price, is her dead brother’s
widow’s brother, and likewise her brother-
in-law once removed. Lorna Price married
young Ainslie Mills, who was shortly after-
wards killed in the South African war.
Dr. Lionel Praagst’s sudden death shocked
a wide circle of friends. He left a wife and
a young son who is studying medicine at
Melbourne University. Mrs. Praagst is a
daughter of dead editor Willoughby, long
time of the Argus, and was absolutely the
prettiest girl of her day. She was not quite
17 when Praagst (looked on then as a con-
firmed bachelor) married her. At that
time he was practising at Horsham, in the
Wimmera, but for years past a big propor-
tion of Brighton looked to him when there
was sickness in the house.
Mrs. Edward Miller presides over the
sedate band of Irish Crochet Workers
(whom Lady Carmichael called together and
encouraged with heart-to-heart talks on
stitches), and other impressive dames back
up Mrs. Edward. Consequently the workers’
show and sale at the Work Association, in
the Block, should be a success. Trousseau
huntresses, after noting that to-day (Thurs-
day) is the time fixed, will rush for the
tram. At least, they will if they are wise.
Also, they will ride on the dummy, so as to
get there first.
The two-year-old daughter ot a wealthy
wool couple is being taught early how to
do the thing well. The lamb travels with
her own cook and kitchen, and, when she
comes down from the country for a city
holiday, the clank of ironmongery- in her
train is like the clatter of an old iron dog
on a hard road.
For over a year an unhappv young man
played the waiting game, while his bride
that was to be gadded round Europe and
gathered rags for the wedding. When, how-
ever. she got back with her accumulation of
moth fodder, she staggered the waiter by in-
timating that matrimony had ceased to at-
tract her. Verily there is no accounting for
some women, and he that tries to audit them,
and find out exactly what dividend they pay,
is laying up bewilderment for the evening of
his days.
A man who is a leading light, or gas buoy,
in society, came back from Fogland this
year wearing a toupee. He is a six-footer;
so the hair-joining is only apparent from
the dress circle or gods when he is seated in
his front stall.
A wealthy Melbourne matron who fell ill
whilst jaunting on the European continent,
put her confidence in a surgeon who hung
out his plate on the shore of Bohemia, and
had a piece of her inside carved out. The
bill was for exactly £IOOO. It w r as a beau-
tiful operation; nevertheless the patient is
said to stand little chance of recovering.
When it came to hand, the family took the
account to be for 1000 francs, and the dis-
covery that the foreign practitioner had
treated his patient as an Australian million-
airess and charged 10 hundred “quids” was
a great shock. The moral is—always strike
a bargain with the artist who is going to
knife you. One is reminded of the story of
the small English actor who came to Aus-
tralia, and became a star. On his return
to Britain, after years of head-swelling in
these latitudes, he received an offer of his
old billet in a provincial co. at £6 a week.
He wired: “My terms are £SO a week.” The
reply wire said: “Make it shillings, and con-
sider the matter settled.” If the sick Aus-
tralian matron abroad had been offered her
operation at £IOOO, she might have replied
“make it francs,” and probably the knife
would have got there just the same.
Rumor asserts that a bridegroom of recent
date, who belongs to a Bayside suburb, is
shaking in his honeymoon slippers owing to a
threat of a breach of promise action. The
disturbing girl lives by the sea at close
motoring distance.
The ladies of the City bf Melbourne stall,
in the St. Vincent’s raid, enticed the Asches
to their corner of the Exhibition last week,
and gave them tea behind the £SOO motor.
However, the raffle girls soon found them
out, and laid siege to Oscar, whilst Lily
Brayton’s royal blue plumes signalled for
help above the heads of another contingent
of brigands. The two subsequently put in a
pleasant half-hour signing photographs for
sale, while the men of the co. hovered over
dolls and doyleys. Lily’s secretary, a smart
girl in blue, collected the parcels in a busi-
ness-like way, and jotted down figures. Miss
Weatherall, in hazel brown clothes, re-
quested Oscar, in loud and friendly tones,
to help with her purchases, while El-
frida Clement, a dainty figure in furs, did
some buying at the bargain Counter.
The usual blank has been discovered in the
bank account of the Leonard-street branch
of the Sutherland Neglected Children’s Home
at Carlton. It is to be filled in by the pro-
ceeds of a dance which has been fixed for
May 25. Mrs. Alfred Deakin is president,
and the committee alone will supply a swarm
of charitable hoppers.
The revival of croquet, with its incidental
restoration of the tame curate to his place
in the ranks of strenuous “sports,” is one of
the quaintest signs of the times. On Good
Friday, a band of Melbourne croqueters
journeyed to Ballarat to do battle with the
best of the local mallet-wielders. The Wind-
sor B team knocked hoops off the country
club, and won the teacake by 11 games, in
spite of a damp lawn. Mrs. Henry Harper,
of Toorak,. was chiefly concerned with her
mallet, while Coroner Cole’s dame lent her
aid with both tongue and forearm. Much
hospitality and many thanks were duly
swallowed and returned by the visitors ere
they finally got off the grass. The revival
of the old lawn game comes in a natural
course of reasoning. If “goff” is Worth half
the fuss lavished upon it, croquet is at least
deserving of some shred of fuss. Asa match-
making ground, the lawn is ,paore seductive
than the links, anyhow.
Australians will be interested somewhat
in the arrest in London, last month, of Uua
Evelyn Wilder (35). on a charge “that she
did send, or caused to be sent, a letter
threatening to murder George Wilder.” The
missive ran:—
George Wilder, the day you get a divorce will be
your last day on earth. You shall be shot through
the heart, so take warning.
The gentleman, having got his divorce, on
the grounds that Una Evelyn had strayed
with_ a Yankee faith-healer, and abhorring
the idea of being punctured, took proceed-
ings as above-mentioned. The Wilders were
out here a year or so ago. They brought
with them as many motor-cars, almost, as
an Ethiopian pugilist, and were rushed by
many of our gentlest born and bred. He
was a tall, fair, godlike youth, with chroni-
cally oil-grimed hands, and a habit of wear-
ing a large gold bangle on his wrist. She,
so rumor averred, had been a bar-lady in the
U.S. before marriage. She looked anything
from five to 10 years older than her consort,
and had what is sometimes known as a
‘ strong face.” There seems little doubt
as to the peril that menaced Mr. Wilder.
According to the evidence, his gunsmith told
him that his wife —
Had bought a revolver, and in July and August last
had taken lessons in revolver shooting, and became
a very. expert shot. She had inquired what was the
most vital part in which a man could be shot, and
Those who hate nasty medicines should try Cham-
berlain’s Tablets. They are easy to take and pleasant
in effect.*
was told in the stomach. A target of the figure of a
man was arranged, and she fired standing at 50 yards,
and walked up to 20 yards’ distance, firing until the
weapon was empty.
So now the gentleman wears the protection
of the law over his stomach as a defence.
Easter campers are telling moist tales of
misery to their friends. One party of dam-
sels pitched their tent within cooee of the
high-class local beer store, and felt fine and
independent, even when the clouds blew
along, and the Easter rain began to fall
softly and silently, as it always does when
beginning a long job. They said it “would
lay the dust, and that the country wanted
it.” But when the sides of the tent were
like wet blotting paper, and the roof sagged
and dropped pellets of icy water ‘down their
necks, and when the sad, wet wind went
wandering by, they said, “Dash it!” and
stamped their feet on the matting floor.
Which made the liquid mud beneath spurt
up. About the same time, the wind decided
to blow the place down. Then the party
repaired to the scorned pub through the
dripping ti-tree, and caused six strange men
to be evicted from their beds and hunted into
the billiard-room to sleep. The extinguished
campers are now known as “The Drowned
Rats.”
The Pierrots, who are wiser than their
clothes would indicate, are shortly coming
in out of the wet —or, rather, they are
separating themselves from it with a roof.
It is a wise move. Their benches are the
refuge of many lovers, and your lover goes
out winter and, summer. But even senti-
ment cannot furnish an audience for an out-
door show in soggy weather.
By all accounts, the Asches’ fortnight’s
rush through India was a joyous affair.
Elfrida Clement (who is with the co., but
has no part in “Kismet”) says the jungle
motoring was a ti-opical dream. The roads,
unlike the local tracks, are good, and the
monkeys that leap across them are more
agile than road-mending politicians. Butter-
flies were so thick that the travelling gas
engines killed showers of the frail, winged
things. Such is life. The other butterflies
were taken while the actresses were left.
The Asches have an embryo baronet super-
ing in “Kismet.” His father is Sir Arthur
Wiltshire, and his lady mother solemnly
commended him to the care of the Asche
management. He is a golden-haired youth
with a drawl, and is the adored of the co.
Margaret Cooper has been going strong at
the Athenaeum Hall. She sings saucy draw-
ing-room songs in a graceful fashion, and
her frocking is an entertainment in itself,
from the tip of her expensive aigrette to
the toes of her silken shoon. One dream of
a gown is a twilight-sky blue with a tracery
of gold round the tunic. It goes with blue
shoes and a golden band which clamps a
feather in her hair. The breathless Athe-
naeum has been made resplendent with
dozens of draped flags. The platform has
mystery curtains of green, from behind
which the assisting baritone and the reciter
glide like figures at a seance. Singer Whitty
is rather a good-looking young man, who
fancies himself, and never has the least
trouble with his hands. The reciter speaks
his piece to the purring of the piano—when
he is not recounting stories too old for ac-
companiment. The motored, who pay six
shillings a seat, get their money’s-worth in
furnishings, for they walk down an avenue
hung witji Fortunatus (paper) roses. The
poor dingy Athenaeum wonders if it has
struck a late spring these days. And pro-
bably Margaret Cooper wondered what she
had struck when the Taits introduced her to
the ancient building.
Off the stage Margaret Cooper is a fine,
breezy, open-air girl, who loathes afternoon
tea crushes and fashionable reception
scrambles, preferring brisk walks and bil-
liards. However, she is also a domesticated
young woman with a genius for clothes-plan-
ning. She was busy ironing at Menzies’
when I met her. After the long voyage,
her cherished clothes were full of creases, and
she was lovingly erasing them with an elec-
tric iron. “Live and learn,” she sighed.
“Next time I’ll wear them all and hang them
up.” Besides cherishing her own garments,
she tirelessly valets her husband, much to
that well-dressed man’s peace of mind. “I
don’t believe there is another woman in
England can put trousers properly in a. press,
or really fold a man’s coat,” she boasts
smilingly.
Margaret Cooper considers that Australia
has missed much in not seeing Lily Elsie,
who is now likely to give up the stage. The
brand-new husband she attached in Novem-
ber last has £25,000 a year, and he has laid
it all at her dainty feet; so there is enough
petty cash in the house to go on with, also
a postage stamp or two.
A big poster has just reached me. It re-
lates to a concert held in the iEolian Hall,
Bond-street, with the name of Queen Alex-
andra heading a list of royal patrons. The
bill-topper” is Hilda Mulligan, the Sydney
soprano. Hilda now ranks among the suc-
cessful Australians abroad. She is “record-
in? i^ or s * x the best Phonographic firms,
and has been elected a member of two Fog-
town clubs—the Arts and Dramatic and the
• h ‘ » f course > the Irish could hardly per-
mit a Mulligan to remain beyond its portals.
From my Adelaide correspondent:—
Easter Monday was a pleasant day to lose money
on, being softly grey and balmy, and yet the race-
course crowd was well below the average. Govern-
ment House coop was half empty. Lady Bosanquet
and one daughter were at Robe, and the other twin
and Captain Fletcher were staying with the Melroses
at Rosebank. Privates Secretary and Mrs. Rowe were
enjoying their “Monday out,” with the painful result
to sturdy loyalists that the Governor and Captain
Walker were the only representatives of our Gracious
Sovereign in evidence. Coats and skirts and smallish
hats were mostly worn—that is by the female race-
goers- Unpicturesque man wore his tubular clothes.
The Maloja, on Saturday, carried off Mrs. Gordon
Ayers, who is deserting us for six months, the George
Milnes and their daughter and Miss .Jean Stirling.
The James Gosses returned to W.A. by the same frail
craft. Aboard the quarantined Malwa are Mr. and
Mrs. Peter Waite and their daughter. Bv the time
this reaches you they will, I fear, be starting on a
lengthy term of isolation at mosquito-ridden Torrens
Island.
The final match of the polo season was held at
Plympton on Easter Thursday, when Adelaide beat
Strathalbyn, and so secured the Richard Smith Chal-
lenge Cup. The audience was monstrous select; in
fact, it was mostly composed of the Governor.
Mr. and Mrs. Maxwell Fowler—she was an Ayers—
are back in this city for six or seven weeks. The
Psyche will have to do without the male half of the
team for a space, appendicitis having smitten him.
Mr. and Mrs. Barr Smith have returned from
Mount Barker to their house in Angas-street. The
Stephen Rallis are back at Kensington, and the
Alee McCullochs have moved their household gods
from Victor Harbor to North Adelaide. This is an-
other way of saying that the Easter holidays are de-
finitely over.
Strange are the vagaries of Fluff. Recently a
Rundle-street window displayed a fur (of sorts) tippet
and muff, alluringly labelled “Lady’s Bathing Cos-
tume, 3s. lid.” It would be warm as far as it went.
A. G. Rymill shone refulgently as a pigeon-extermi-
nator at the Metropolitan Gun Club’s contest on Good
Friday. He blew 52 birds to pieces, and cleared £SO
(apart from bets) by his kindly action.
The St. Peter’s College annual sports were held on
AVcdnesda.y afternoon, before the usual adoring crowd
of mothers and aunts. C. J. Way's dame presented
the prizes.
Harold Power is going well as an animal painter
in London. The critics acclaim him, and, which is
more to the point, the public has taken to buying his
pictures.
The annual meeting of the Adelaide Golf Club was
a somewhat heated and mournful affair. There was
an embittered dispute as to whether all paid-up sub-
scribers should be allowed to vote, or only those who
had responded to the call, made by the outgoing com-
mittee. Certain members eventually left, breathing
fiercely through the nostrils, and muttering such
phrases as “Theideeur!” “Neverrurd such a thing in
me life,” and then fresh trouble arose. A general
meeting demands 14 days’ notice, and it transpired
that of this one only 10 days’ notice had been given.
After reproaches and rebukes had been freely bandied
round, anew committee was elected. It starts opera-
tions with a burden of debt, calculated to make the
club realise something of the emotions of a State
Government. By the way, the Glenelg Club was also
£4l to the bad till recently, when some affluent
members stepped crcdiforwards, cheque in hand, and
put it financially straight.

scientific knowledge for, after all, science is but
the application of Nature’s laws to the uplifting
and advancement of humanity to a greater realisa-
tion of the true beauty and joy of living. Where
Nature fails—science fulfils. The famous French

Just Sit Down and Reason
the Thing Out.
YOU say your scalp and hair are m a most unhealthy condition. Your
hair, which was once admired by everybody, is now so miserably
thin and lustreless that people commiserate with you, and ask
what has become of your beautiful hair. Yes, you have used nearly every
advertised remedy to try .and check its fall, and to preserve its color, but
they only make it worse.
A LADY writes:—“A few months ago I did what I ought to have
done when my hair first showed signs of deteriorating. Instead of
wasting my time and money on a lot of Quack Nostrums, I consulted
you, whom I had heard of for years as being a Hair Specialist of long
standing in this country. I was afraid your charge would be beyond my
means to pay. It was sheer necessity at last which compelled me to visit
you. When I asked your charge, I was agreeably surprised to find I had
nothing to pay beyond the price charged for your remedies. These
were not more expensive than the Quack Nostrums, and there was this
difference, whereas I spent Six Pounds on those Nostrums, and got abso-
lutely no beneficial results (indeed, my hair was getting less the longer I
used them), one course of your treatment removed the scurf and irritation
from my scalp, and started a new growth of hair. After six months’
treatment, I am glad to say the effect is so marked that my friends ask me
what lam doing to my hair. It is getting nice and thick, and looks in a
healthy condition. I think your Shampuna a lovely thing. I would not
like to be without it now. I have persuaded a dozen of my friends to use
it, and they ail speak most highly of it.”
FATHER RYAN writes:—‘‘Dear Mr. Holland, —I am writing to
you for another supply of your excellent hair-wash. I cannot speak too
highly of your hair restorer. It is the only genuine stuff on the market.
As I have tried nearly all others, I think I am competent to pass judg-
ment. Please send to the enclosed address one bottle of Parasene Special,
one box of Exemo, and three packets of Shampuna. The latter is a
splendid wash. I shall never fail to recommend your treatment as it
justly deserves.”
Mr. KELLY writes:—“l want you to send me four months’ treat-
ment of Parasene and Cosmo. I want these for a friend, who noticed
how quickly my hair grew under your treatment.”
Wonderful Testimonials can be seen at my consulting rooms, proving
that my treatment is successful, if used for a reasonable time.
Scalps which have been nearly bald for years are now growing a
good, healthy crop of hair.
Mr. CUMMINGS writes from S.A.:—“My hair is getting on first-
rate.”
Mr. JOHNSON writes from Queensland: —“I have used your treat-
ment for a few months, and my hair is growing real good.”
Mr. CROSBY, Sea Lake, Victoria, writes:—“Two years ago I had
no hair on the top of my head; now, thanks to your wonderful remedy, I
have a splendid crop of hair.”
Mr. SHEPPARD, Tasmania, writes:—“l lost my hair, every bit of
it, when I was two years old, and I have been quite bald for 15 years. I
have used dozens of preparations, but they failed utterly to give me any
hair. Your treatment was brought under my notice, and lam glad to
say I am getting a splendid crop of hair.”
Mr. REYNOLDS, of Launceston, came to Melbourne to buy a wig.
Before doing so, he was advised to consult me, and, as a result of my
treatment, he has secured a good head of hair.
CONSTABLE TURNER, of N. S. Wales, writes:—“A friend of
mine was as bald as a billiard ball, and wore a wig for two years. He
has now secured a good head of hair with your Special Parasene and
Cosmo.”
A GENTLEMAN writes from Ravensthorpe (Q.) : —“I have been
troubled with a most severe form of scalp disease, and, although I have
had the best medical skill available, I was never free from a terrible irri-
tation until I commenced a six months’ course of your Parasene and
Cosmo. lam happy to say it is now quite cured. I look upon the money
spent on your treatment as a most excellent investment.”
NATURALINE TESTIMONIALS.
MADAM VATCHES writes from Queensland: —“I have only used
two applications of your Naturaline, and it has colored my hair perfectly.
It’s a beautiful thing.”
A LADY living at Gawler, S.A., writes:—“l have used your
Naturaline for over 12 years, and none of my friends know I have a grey
hair on my head.”
A LADY writes from Wellington, N.Z.:—“I never thought it
possible to get a preparation which would color my grey hair so perfectly
as your Naturaline does.”
Gentlemen whose hair is falling out should use Special Parasene at
night, and Cosmo in the morning, and wash the hair once a week with
Shampuna.

POLITICAL
POINTS
The population congestion policy has
worked so wonderfully in Victoria that now,
out of 21 Federal Representatives, the
little space on which Melbourne stands has
10 and all the other 87,000 square miles of
the State have 11. That makes 21 all told.
A little while ago Melbourne had nine, and
the rest of the State 13 (total 22), and some
time earlier the total was 23. The apparent
reason of the slump is that much congestion
is driving people out of the State.
• “Pat O’Maori” writes :
The new Maoriland Ministry looks like a compro-
mise between hope and the Devil. It contains several
men who might, if circumstances were not too strong
for them, lead the quivering mass of insular political
absurdity out into a much larger place. If the pro-
gressive element in the Cabinet had its way, Cohen
and all his works would soon be bitter memories of
the past, but the friends of the Israelitish darkness
will probably take up the vessels of the old drunk,
and run once more to the fountains whence I O U’s
are drawn. Weakness must buy its way with loan
money, but if one man should now arise with a
gospel of straight and honest finance, Maoriland
would in years to come be filled from Cape Maria
Van Diemen to the Bluff with statues of her saviour.
There is a big show for someone who has the courage
to lift a vast yell of utter conviction.
In Melbourne, the other week, there was a
glaring instance of the diplomatic dishonesty
of our Immigration Restriction Act, which
Joe Chamberlain shaped to Himperial re-
quirements. One Joseph Belcourt, a colored
native of Mauritius, had deserted from a
ship, and evaded —on a technical point—the
captain’s effort to recapture him. So the
Customs Department arrested the undesir-
able alien as a prohibited immigrant, and
fixed him with an educational test in the
German language. The man could read and
write French and English, therefore he was
not tested in either. The Immigration Act
has a good fixed purpose and a darned, des-
picable manner of achieving it. It is the
meanest offspring of Imperial Policy that
was ever foisted on White Australia.
The principal Ulster argument against
Home Rule, as expressed by Bonar Law, the
Unionist leader, is an unconsciously humor-
ous declaration that Ulster is not nationally
allied to Leinster, Connaught and Munster.
Says Bonar Law: —
The creation of a national Parliament, even if it
were friendly, would involve friction, and, in the
event of war, England’d difficulty would be seized
upon as Ireland’s opportunity.
Which statement involves the assumption
that Ireland ought to be still refused Home
Rule, because it is only waiting for the
necessary freedom, and a convenient oppor-
tunity, to break away from Britain, and es-
tablish itself as a foreign State, with a rebel
Ulster on its hands. Practically, then, the
cry of Ulster and the British Unionists is
a plea for the continuance of minorit l ' rule
in the Emerald Isle.
Those Sydney people who started out to
raise £1,800,000 or so that they might pre-
sent the blushing and embarrassed Bull with
a Dreadnought, and only got £40,000, pro-
pose to hand over the belated scrap of
money to the Federal Naval College. But
they don’t want their contribution buried
in the general heap ; they desire to be com-
memorated in a special wing or building,
with a distinctive name —Fiasco Hall or
Ass College, or something of the sort. It
would be 1000 times better if the Australian
Government bade them give their little, bit
to the hospitals of N.S.W. . The hospitals
want it badly, and there isn’t enough of it
to make any difference to the Common-
wealth.

moribund humping the dead. And now, being
adjudged too decayed even for service as a
training ship, the exhausted vehicle is to be
made into soup. It was never more than a
tb ird- or fourth-class ship, and was nearly

Melbourne Age lately unearthed the
amazing fact that the net income the City
Council gathers in from that abode of cheap
jacks, rifle saloons, Aunt Sally shows and
the like, the Eastern Market, is just £742.
As the rates on a similar-sized block across
the street amount to £382, the council really
reaps a rental of £36o—from a property
worth about, £200,000! The funny thing
about it is that the councillors are mostly
“business” men, and if anybody suggested
that they should let a private -property
worth that sum for anything less than
£IO,OOO a year they would go into hysteric'fe
forthwith.
The roar of a very small but deafening
minority threatens to paralyse the attempt
at national defence in Maoriland. In a
country with a decent system of Parlia-
mentary Government it is always a minority
that roars —a majority doesn t _ require to.
Certain cowardly and unpatriotic louts de-
clined flatly to do their little bit of drill.
Being fined, they flatly refused to pay, and,
so to speak, “took a lunar” at the authori-
ties. Then some of them were put in gaol,
but the shrieks of a few people with um-
brellas and goloshes were so terrible that
the MacKenzie Government immediately let
them out again. So the precedent lias been
established that when it is a case of Lout
v. Law, the plaintiff wins.
The chief defect of Ma State politics is
that the factions never get to blows. They
always stop at the blowing stage.
In his Temora speech, N.S.W. Attorney-
General Holman quoted a lot of figures to
show the progress of the State under the
McGowen Ministry as compared with that
of Wade. He compared 1911 with 1910,
and whooped mightily, including in his com-
parisons such purely Commonwealth-ruled
matters as shipping and oversea trade. As
a matter of fact, the boom began before
McGowen and before Wade. It had its
origin in two things—Federation, which
Holman opposed; and Protection, which
Holman denounced with absurd fury.
The Victorian authorities, insistently
pushed by Elwood Mead, are going in
for irrigation on a really large scale, but
unless it provides that the water shall be
paid for by every landholder to whom it is
offered, somebody will presently get hurt,
and there will be a repetition of the Rodney
irrigation swindle, by which the landowners
secured the increment while passing the ‘bill
on to the State. Water Supply Minister
Graham has now got surveyors busy testr
ing the area for the site of anew reservoir
on the Goulburn river below its junction
with the Delatite, which is to be double the
capacity of the Waranga Basin —and that
holds 53,360,000,000 gallons. Of course, the
reservoir need not necessarily cost as much
as Waranga, but it will cost something, and
there is no obvious reason why the citizens
should spend thousands in impounding water
when only about one landowner in 10 along
the channels will use it.
Customs Minister Tudor finds that he has
just £2500 wherewith to start on the job of
lighting up all the dark sea lanes and high-
ways the Commonwealth took over from the
casual, untidy States—and the States had a
remarkable accumulation of marine dark-
ness to get rid of. The Bananaland coast
alone, according to an official estimate, needs
well over £50,000; Victoria wants £10,000;
and the other States clamor for illumination
in proportion. If the recommendations are
adopted, the unattended acetylene light,
which is operated by the heat of the sun, will
twinkle numerously inside the dangerous
Barrier, where the lost Yongala lies. They
are said to be so safe and cheap that France
has an average of one every 5£ miles. On
the other tack, an Australian coastal skip-
per has. already given one or two instances in
his own experience of the failure of unat-
tended/lights when badly needed. In the
meantime, Tudor has only the price of a few
packets of candles, and the sea traveller
continues to put his trust in Providence,
which, in this regard, is about as reliable as
a hard-up family solicitor with a passion for
gambling.

Two farmers, who had agreed to share a
crop between them, but couldn’t decide as to
the correct time for digging it, last week
asked N.S.W. Equity Court to resolve when
the potato is well and truly ripe. While
the Court was still in an agricultural frame
of mind, it might have settled when the time
is ripe and ready for action. A heap of im-
portant jobs could be started right away if
someone would give a ruling on the subject.
By way of a commentary on the sluggish-
ness of the Australian defence authorities,
it is worth noting that the unfinished cruiser
Australia is already out of the first line,
so to speak. Britain’s boss cruiser is the
Queen Mary. Next come the twins, Lion
and Princess Royal. The Indefatigable, of
which the Australia and New Zealandia
are copies, only ranks fourth nowadays.
Some points for Tasmanians to consider
before election day. Theirs is the most con-
sistently Tory State in Australia. It has
done more at promoting the influx of foreign
capital than any other State. It has, con-
sequently, the biggest. unproductive debt per
head, and a larger proportion of the lands,
mines, railways, tramways, shipping, insur-
ance, banking and mercantile enterprises are
owned by foreign capital than is the case in
any State of the mainland. As one result:
In' Tasmania, 331 persons per 100,000 are
invalid pensioners, whereas the average for
the Commonwealth is only 225, and the
average for Australia is much lower. (South
Australia’s invalid pensioners are only 150
per 100,000.) Then, by way of another
result, Tasmania has 2060 old age pensioners
per 100,000 against a Commonwealth aver-
age of 1770, and the Commonwealth average
would be much lower if Tasmania was out
of it (Westralia has 1140, and S.A. 1760
old age pensioners per 100,000). Westralia
and S.A. may have gained by Federation in
the matter of Federal railway-construction,
but Tasmania has certainly got more or less
square by passing a superfluity of ancients
and cripples on to the common fund.
THE EMPHASIS OF JAMES.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Discussing the Bottle Neck, at Redfern, and the
dislocation of the Easter railway traffic, the Premier
(Mr. McGowen) was emphatic in stating that some-
thing would have to be done to relieve the conges-
tion. —S. M. Herald.
James is emphatic! Something must be done 1
A thousand wheels are jarring in the gate
Where, narrowing to a point, all railways run,
Bearing the growing traffic of a State
Past the broad outlets they are taught to shun,
The sad, mast-empty ports that still may wait.
James is emphatic! Quite a year ago
The problem was as bad as it is now,
And if our trade continue still to grow,
Men still may stand with sweat upon their brow
Quite a year hence, and mention that they know
Something must happen to prevent a row.
James is emphatic! Goods perchance may reach
Their destination if their luck hold out;
Patience is not a happy thing to preach
To truckless farmers when they rage and shout;
’Tis clear that someone needs must make a speech
To scatter all the clouds of wrath and doubt.
James is emphatic! Something must take place !
What shall we do to ease the stress and strain ?
Perchance a handbreadth more of robm and space
Might rob pent Redfern of its bitter pain,
Or we, mayhap, might gain a moment’s grace
By rubbing oil on some belated train.
James is emphatic! Something must be done !
What it must be or how we dare not statfe!
To Sydney all the various wheels must run,
. For clearly that is the intent of fate.
Awake! Arise! Our task we dare not shun —
We shall say something at an early date.

GEORGE STREET.
AS BAD AS A
KNIFE STAB.
This Man in Agony with Darting
Sciatic Pains.
He Suffered for Many Months,
and tells how Dr. Williams' Pink
Pills Cured Him.
A statement in a newspaper about a man
who had been cured of sciatica by Dr. Wil-
liams’ Pink Pills was of great service to
Mr. Hugh McEwan, of Wagga Wagga, a
lorry driver in the employ of It. Thompson
& Co. He had suffered with sciatica badly
for seven months, and had rubbed a _ great
many liniments on the affected hips without
being able to rub the complaint away. This
was not to be wondered at, because sciatica
is a disorder of the nerves, and he needed a
nerve tonic like Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills to
restore his nerves to a healthy state. He
read how Dr. Williams’ Pink Pills had cured
sciatica, tried them, and was cured.
“I was engaged in sinking a shaft on some
land, and had to come up to the surface
when hot, and got a chill right through me,’
he told a reporter. “The next day I felt
pretty stiff, and the day after I felt sciatica,
and that attack lasted a full fortnight. I
was laid up for a week, for I simply could
not work. The pain was solely in the left
hip. I was quite lopsided with it, and I
could not straighten myself. _ Every move-
ment gave me a twinge of pain that was as
much as I could bear. It was every bit as
bad as if I were being stabbed with a knife.
Until I got warmed up as the day wore on
I could only hobble about. When I got out
of bed I could not bend dow r n to lace my
boots. If I turned over on my left side
when asleep the pain would wake me up and
keep me awake. The attack eased off for
about three months —enough for me to go
back to work, but I could always feel it was
there, especially in the mornings on waking.
During the day I would dread to have to
stoop or bend. I used to rub the affected
parts with turps and liniments, but no
relief came except for a few minutes. When
I got cool after the day’s work was over I
felt the pain coming back into my hip. I
never knew when an attack was coming on,
and every attack was more severe than the
last. It was the cruellest of pains, and. I
hope never to have anything so severe again.
I had the attacks altogether for seven
months, then I decided to try Dr. Williams’
Pink Pills, as I had read of them. I felt so
encouraged with the results of the first
three boxes that I decided to keep on, and I
am glad I did. The pills drove the pain
slowly but surely out of my hip and my
muscles became flexible once more. It was
a great change frqm being half crippled.
Now I can tackle the heaviest work and lift
any weight all day and every day, and feel
fit to jump over a two-storev house, as the
saving is, thanks to Dr. Williams’ Pink
Pills.”

SPORTING
NOTIONS
. Reginald Baker did Samuel Langford alto-
giuuk too muca nonor py allowing tne vagaries of
u3e ; colored bruiser to drive him out of his position
us| stipendiary referee to the Sydney Stadium. it
v, as a lousiness mat Baker was eminently suited for.
Hut, ' unfortunately, tne great Australian referee is
uAdply, sensitive. He regarded tne objection of
Lingford to ng-nt under his jurisdiction as a personal
un-rouc, and -was, apparently, sore witn the Mclii:
sibqsir that He did not insist tiiat Langford snoulu
aejeept tne. Stadium and its ottieials, or get right out.
uV.OuSly, Samuel L., considering his position, dare
not Yefuse to Ught, and wicliout a doubt Mclnstoush
an- large end of the stick if he careu to’wield
itJ, But what Baker never considered was tiiat the
agreements covering these combats were made at the
other side of the world, where the practice of object-
ing to the referee is as common as beer at lunch, and
v« ..ere every referee, not excepting tne great Lugene
vJurrr himself, lias been objected to at some time or
otiier. Langford and McVea were both entitled under
nihil Agreement to object to any referee —that is to
saypitne agreements provided tiiat the referee should
be Appointed by mutual consent; so under his eon-
uact, 1 tne Mclnstoush, who, whatever his faults may
beU’is one of tne fairest men in the world, could
not Very well, in honor, apply the screw to either
heap of darkness. And he didn’t, lie stuck to the
letter and spirit of his bond. Probably it was not
Langfpru’s objection alone that decided Baker’s course
of action, lie was wroth at muen of tne printed
criticism that had appeared. But if he had set
down iii a balance-sheet the printed criticism and the
printed’ praise, he would have found that he stood
with a huge balance on the credit side. Not a
writer on the Sydney sporting press but declares
“Snqjvy” Baker the fairest referee under the sun, and
among the best. It is possible to disagree with a
man;, arid yet»respect his opinion, and it is safe to
say /’that tile pressmen who mostly disagreed with
Mr. VRaker J would be the first 'to defend him in any
atiapjii on his impartiality, or his knowledge of the
game* However, although he has thrown up his job,
lie; has not parted with the goodwill and respect of
evferyi fair-minded follower of boxing in Sydney.
Quite 1 , recently lie started a magazine devoted to
physical culture, and in the coming issue he will
giyeihis impressions of the second McVea-Langford
fight, 'Which he watched closely from a ring-side seat.
There’s going- to be a rush for that issue of the
magazine. {
Sam IVtcVea’s trainer did not waste sym-
pathy!,- ori : Jiis bruiser over the defeat by Langford,
lie skid, in effect, that it served the god in ebony
darnrid wfejl right, as he had wasted too much time
fooling round with his motor, instead of attending
to thl work of getting fit. In fact, McClain rather
hinted that a bruiser shouldn’t keep motors, but
should stick to his gloves all the time. And then,
just as if to bear him out, Samuel went out and got
his, finger so badly crushed in some of the gear of his
odbp-distributor that all engagements had to be post-
poned indefinitely.

The battle between Lester and Jack
Howard, at Sydney Stadium, on Saturday night, was
stopped by the police in the tenth round, on the
ground thijt Howard- was obviously done for. Which
was all Thomas-rot. They were both mighty tired,
and Leste'ri certainly had the, best of' the battle,,
Howard having been foolish or unfortunate enough to
allow the Yankee tound-armer to land a few 4f his,
whirly-whirlies. But he was' far from being an
outed man.- The curious part of the business': is that
the police did not interfere to stop the racing at
Randwick, when three horses fell and three jockeys
were badly injured, one pf them sustaining, a.
fractured skull, from which he subsequently died.
There was a fearful howl of horror and indignation
over Langford’s puffed eye; but, so far, writer hasn’t
heard a snort about young Matthews’s broken skull, or
Bolton’s broken ribs, or Shanahan’s torn leg. It’s a
weird world !
American light circles were recently
broken-hearted over the death of one Billy Delaney.
Billiam’s claim to the tears of posterity rested on
the fact that he discovered and made Jim Corbett,
the man who outed John Lawrence Sullivan, usually
known as “Jonel” ; and also brought to light A 1
Kauffman, the busted White Hope ; but mostly was
he famous as the creator of James J. Jeffries. He
foijrid James as > raw as they are made, and created
him. Amuykan pugdom was savage with him for
leaving Jeffries and taking a hand in the training
rii Johnson for the fight at Reno. But Delaney was
imeompromising, and spoke back with a vim: “You
lays want; to? know why I qriit Jeff,” he snarled.
jl|’lljteti you! It was this way. I quit Jeffries
M- welshing on a gambling debt and running out of
ffle /jgauirgs -.'match. I couldn’t conscientiously have
fijy ISrlhrir 'dealings with Jeff, after that, you know!”
The deaA trainer bad a, great reputation fpr straight
dealing input A pugdom hated to riee him helping a
Ihick.'iriiri get fit to wallop a white one.
York boxing is -under the control
of;; appointed Commission, which seems to
be armed ‘ r tn®B fairly enormous powers. The Com-
lfiissjofirilririf February, raised considerable dust by
falling oft Atlell, the feather-weight Hebrew
fighter; who loomed fairly large in the fistic sky,
after “Knockmut” Brown. “Knock-
out” gets bis .iriokriame from, the fact that he is no
boxer, but lMlafjfy wins on a knock-out, which he
obtains style of scrapping—it can’t be
called''boxing. .Amtell, js generally regarded as- a
iriaster of fistic science, arid the crowd that went to
s& the ,ifight stactaxed, though hq was giving Brown
Mb. in weight, Afiat the skilled boxer would make a
i&y show of the crude- smiter. Attell didn’t. In
fact, he proved a Soil: snap for the crude rusher ; . and
any display of boxing was given by the crude one.
But. all the same, he failed to knock out Attell. The
audience .included two members of .the-Boxing Com-
rfrission, and Attell was promptly called upon to ex-
riiain his showing. His explanation was clumsy,
lie said he had a bad thumb before' the fight, and
gp a doctor to inject cocaine. The doctor gave him
t& milch, with the result that he became dazed and
hardly' knew what he was doing. The Commissioners
if|uired if he had backed himself ■to win. Hfe ad-
mitted he had not—-his manager had failed to-get
tie money on. Then the doctor who had injected
the cocaine volunteered in an angry manner that he
had not over-dosed ‘Attell. lie had,' if.' anything,
underdone it; and he gave particulars of the dose..
The end of it was that the Commissioners decided
that, for some reasons of his own, AtteU was anxious
to lose the fight; and had lost it deliberately by
not pounding to the best of his ability. So lit barred
him from fighting in New York State or City for a
period of six months. The general opinion seems to
be that he refrained from backing himself because
he intended to lose; and that he had de-
termined to lose with a view of getting better
odds in the future, when he meant to win. lhe
action of the Commission has delighted the press, but
has caused the fighting fraternity to sit up with a
serious, not to say alarmed, expression. #
Gus Ruhlin, the Yankee Swede, or Swed-
ish Yankee, who was around in the days when Jef-
fries, Sharkey and Fitzsimmons were giants, died at
his home in Brooklyn, N.Y., in February, and of
apoplexy, above all things. Ruhlin promised great
things, ‘but his career was somewhat brief. It was
his ill-luck to live in the days of the giants; and
they wiped him out in short order. He was born
at Canton, in the State of Ohio, in 1872, so was
40 years of age at the time of liis death. He struck
his first great disaster at Coney Island, in 1898,
when Tom Sharkey knocked him out in the first
round. But two years later he returned to the
charge and walloped Sharkey in the same ring in 15
rounds. He also beat Sharkey, in London, in 190,2.
He fought the great Jeffries twice, and went down on
both occasions—first at ’Frisco, in 1890, in a 20-
round battle, and then again at ’Frisco in 1901, when
he was knocked out in the fifth round. His greatest
disaster was when he faced Robert Fitzs mmons at
Madison Square Garden, in 1900. It lasted six
rounds, and after that the Swedish tower never re-
covered his confidence. When boxing fell under ■ a
cloud he took to wrestling, and then gravitated quite
naturally to the pub on Myrtle Avenue, Brooklyn
(N.Y.), where he died. He was a steeple of a man,
standing 6ft. 2in. in his socks, and weighed in the
heyday of his strength, 14st. 91b. #
The proposed battle between Johnson and
fireman Flvnn is still in the air, but, when the last
mail left the United States, it was fairly well under-
stood that it would not be allowed on U.S. soil.
Nevada was the only State in the Union to which
the Great Boycott had not been extended, but from
a careful counting of noses the promoters have de-
cided that it is unsafe to risk any expenditure. So
it is now proposed to hold the scrap at the Mexican
town of Juarez, just across the Yankee border —the
scene of the story, “The City of Free Drinks,” in
The Lone Hand of December, 1911. One of the
numerous governments which at present infest Mexico
has given permission, and the insurgents are delighted
at the prospect* of holding up a horde of “Gringoes”
with money in their fclothes. It would be a charm-
ing thing if Johnson went down to Mexico to figjit
Flynn, and had to take on a roving band of “insur-
rectos” instead. It is on record that a Central
American revolution was broken up by a hardened
Yankee youth who had played in the Harvard foot-
ball team, and who rushed at the council of insur-
gent leaders with his head down and his college
yell in his mouth, but there is a growing impression
that the Mexican trouble will not be settled by
Johnson. A proposed alternative l is a central Cana-
dian town. Altogether, Johnson must be feeling
sorry now that he broke his contract with the
Mclnstoush to fight McVea for the championship, on
the night of the Grand Prix in Paris. It is said
that Johnson has an intense dislike to fighting men <
of his own race; but in this he is far from alone;
that d : sinclination characterises all negroes. Some-
body has been trying to arrange for a battle between
the champion and Joe Jeanette, but Johnson’s dis-
like to put a head on his brother nigger, and t,he
operations of the Great Boycott, have brought, nego-
tiations to an end.. Altogether, Johnson’s chances of
making money with his fists in the great and glorious
Uf.S.A. seem ,to -be nil. It is a weird situation,,
The close of the 11th round of Sydney
Firs ( t. Grade Metropolitan cricket left the premiership
an absolutely open question among North Sydney,
University and Redfern. North Sydney has 18 com-
petition points, University 17, and Redfern, the
Syrian suburb, 16: so, with another round to go,
anything is possible. Saturday last was a wintry
day. and the cricketers were much disturbed by the
howls of the football barrackers, over the fences,
cheering their men on to boots and sudden death. It
made the willow-wieiders feel they were lagging
superfluous. And, truly, we are getting a bit tired
of cricket. It seems dull now the silly six have
ceased from troubling and the McFlhone is at rest.
North Sydney, having dismissed Gordon for 166, piled
up 300 for the loss of five wickets, and so won bv
five wickets and 134 runs on the first attempt. Red-
fern smote Burwood. hit) and thigh, and, scored a first-
innings’ yictory by 123 runs. Redfern made a gal-
lant attempt to secure a full-point victory, dismiss-
ing Burwood for 92, and then closing with 315 for
the loss of seven wickets. But the attempt failed,
owing to Burwood unexpectedly producing a cen-
turion, who rushed up 108, so when the wintry light
p-ave out, Only four wickets had fallen for 201 runs.
The University Samson fell on the Philistines of
Paddington, smote them with the jawbone of its bat
for 143, and then .raised 278 for the loss of seven
wickets, and so won out with three wickets and 13-5
runs to spare on the first innings. Balmain went up
to Parramatta ; and finished its deadly work, beating
Central Cumberland by 117 on the -first innings.
After that the results became commonplace. Glebe,
having made onlv 79, faded out before Middle Har-
bor’s 112, by 33 on the first innings. Petersham
made 198, and then succeeded in taking only fite
Waverley wickets for 125, fand thus scored g; drawn
game. i
Only two century-getters appeared during the after-
noon. S. Hill, brother of Clem of that ilk, smotg
131 in 110 minutes for North Svdnev against Gor-
don, and P. YV. Docker, of Burwood, hit up 108 in
90 minutes for Burwood,. which same upset the Red-
fern three-point-win apple cart. Amott discoursed
to the extent of 92 for Balmain against Parramatta :
and Barnes TJ.C.) notched 78 for Redfern against
Burwood. Randell, the Middle Harbor howler, wa's
the lion of the day, takins - five Glebe wickets-for 25.
Dupain put 'up a good fight for Burwood. by taking
three Redfern wickets for 21. Dr. Hordern snatched
four Gordon wickets tor 31. on behalf of North Svd-
nev,; and Rough, of PWorsham, got away with three
\Vivorlev sticks for 28. Besides these, there were
others who did good trundling, but the list grows
wearisome.

London Daily Ghrontclf devotes a col-
umn to a discussion of the ruction in the Australian
cricketing world. It noints out that Hm visits from Aus-
tralia and South Africa’will spell‘financial disaster
' When the quality of food taken is too rich or the
quantity too much, take Chamberlain’s Tablets.*
for most of the English counties. In view of these
visits “it has been necessary to re-organise the whole
of the arrangements for the coming season. the
county games have been made entirely subservient
to the triangular tests and the tonrs' of the visiting
colonials. Now is it likely that all this 'will have to
bd done to provide for a visit of Australia s second
best eleven and a team from South Africa, whose re-
sources grow beautifully less with every fresh cable
we receive? An Australian team, minus Trumper,
Hill, Ransford, Armstrong, Hordern, Carter and Cot-
ter is not going to be anything like the attraction
to the public that previous teams have been. That
remains to be seen. The Daily Chronicle is unduly
pessimistic. No doubt Trumper, Hill and co. are
popular with the British cricket-loving public for the
sake of old long since, but what the D.C. forgets is
that they are now well advanced in the yeteran fatty
stage, and that a team largely composed of lean, wiry
youngsters would stand a much better chance of re-
gaining those precious ashes.
Now that things are quiet,
give me a moment to deny that in cricket (as stated
lately in The Bulletin) “the name of S.A. is Mud.
The charge was that she has won the Sheffield Shield
only twice in 20 years. It is literally true; and
why she never won it all the time that Darling and
Hill and Ernest Jones were in their prime .together,
is one of the masteries of the game.- But observe
that S.A. was premier State the season before the
Shield happened to come into existence. Also, that
a year ago she beat N.S.W. in the only match played,
and tied for top place, with two to one; but Ma,
being too busy or tired or something to go to Ade-
laide for a return game, and having done better
against Victoria, calmly claimed the Shield on aver-
ages. A score of 31- ‘in 21 years does not look so
bad for the junior partner of three; and there have
been hardly any years when S.A. has not beaten one
of the others, and sb influenced the final result. But
all this -is on the absolute results. How about it
relatively to the Yemaining States? S.A. long ago
butted into big cricket by sheer merit —the merit of
Giffen, Lyons and Jarvis principally—and has stayed
there, and during the last 15 years has found captains
for 1 the Australian XI most of the time. Why
haven’t Tas. and Q. and W.A. done one-fiftieth as
much? The Mud must be theirs—though, to do
them justice, they seem nearly to kick up a
dust at last; ’■

Last Monday saw some interesting cross-
country racing at Bathurst (N.5.W,)., over a three-
mile stretch of heavy, ploughed ground. Three
youths, one of whom was wearing knickerbockers, and
all of whom are said to “have come from Sydney,”
are accused of levying contributions on the
district. Mounted police went tin pursuit, and
found the youths on bicycles. The bikes beat the
horses on the Friday, or thereabouts. On Monday, the
bikes having been found, the police went out to round
up the youngsters and beat up the district of Raglan.
About 5.30 the kids were sighted camped on the
banks of the Macquarie River, and, when the police
rode to within 40 yards, it was seen that one was
busy cutting the hair of one of his mates. Then
the ; police dismounted and tried an enveloping move-
ment; but the lads broke away, scrambled through
somp fences, and made off across the heavy ground,
with the Hop brotherhood in full pursuit. It was
a great race, and the lightweights kept it going for
about three miles; when the Hop brotherhood, finding
themselves outpaced, opened fire. The lads'had made,
good pace-before, but when they heard the bark of
the irevolvers, and the ping-ping of the bullets, they
unwound a sprint that eaused the Hop crowd to lean
bade and gasp with admiration. The accused were
last seen vanishing into undergrowth.

The returned “Kangaroos” put a team into
the field on Saturday last, at Sydney, against the
Hunter and Northern Association (N.S.W.), just to
show the natives how the trick was done in old England.
But the wind was against spectacular play, and the
game had to be carried through on bullocking lines.
The Hunter and Northern men bullocked 'mightily,
but, lacking combination, they were blown away by
the consol’dated charges of the disciplined Kangaroos.
The returned wanderers won by 22 to 5; but, con-
sidering the perfect combination of the Australasian
it earn, that was a most, honorable defeat.
When the whistle had announced the down-
fall of the Hunter and Northern Association, the
-rout of the Metropolitan Team commenced. The
routers were another team of returned Kangaroos,
afid a crowd which showed even better combination
than the first. But in this case the League was
following or fulfilling the Scripture which sayeth
that the first shall be last. The Metropolitan team
was looked upon as being up to the level of the re-
turned wanderers ; and all the big guns that had not
gone abroad were there to show that they should.
They had. nary a chance. The sustained charges of
the men fresh from the fields: of glory hurled
the Metropolitans back on their line, where they
fought hard for their goals. The Metropolitan crowd
was far better than the Hunter and Northern crowd,
and opposed order to order. But the returned Kan-
garoos were, just finishing a successful season, and
the others were beginning it; and between them was
a great/gulf fixed at 27 points to nine.

When j/jD; Williams ran his Six-Days
meeting, at Sydney Gricket Ground, the usual croaker
said it was a mere flash in the. pan; but, the Easter
Carnival at the Sports Ground proved that idea to be
altogether wrong. Cycling has been revived in N. S.
Wales. It has - not reached that dizzy altitude it
attained, in the glorious , nights when Sydney Thou-
sands were run off; but it is edging that way; and
the promoter is in the happy position of having pulled
a decaying sport out of the gutter and made money
by doing it. Next season, better and larger pro-
grammes will be put on, and things will roar. The
only fly'in the ointment was the disappointing form of
Ay J. ' Clarke, the man who has more’than once
extended the astounding Frank Kramer. On Aus-
tralian ; (racks he showed neither the speed nor. judg--
mfint of a champion; and people wondered how he
fever achieved fame. The probable explanation is
‘that Clarke regarded his trip home as a holiday, and
just let! himself go for ease and comfort. But even
so, we expected to see something of the marvellous
sprinting judgment. It was never visible. He has
informed reporters that if he comes along next year
he will pome in good fettle. Anyhow, it isn’t worth
hfs while coming at all, unless he comes in better
fettle than he came this season. The best rider in
Australia this season was easily Goullett; and he
swept the board in both sprint races'and handieaps.
Grenda, the vast Tasmanian wheeler, also stood out
as a mighty twirler of his hind legs; and, very wisely,
left for the U.S.A. on Monday Week, with the bunch.
He will do well in the Republic, for he is a vastly
superior rider to what Clarke, Hehir and Goullett
were when they set out to seek fame and fortune
abroad.. Also, he has the advantage of superior
phvsique. His Strength is enormous, and his dogged-
ness and pluck appear to be in proportion.

, The Defence authorities were vastly" im-
pressed* by the showing of the' cyclists in the Dunlop-
promoted” Adelaide to Sydney relay ride. The ques-
tion arises—how would, they have got on had a strip
Of the hitervening country been held by an enemy?
They certainly seem to have- a better chance than
pither car or motor-bike, as they could sneak through
place where neither car nor petrol-bike could venture.
In fact, wherever a man can walk, providing it is
hot up. the side of a precipice, or down one,
the cyclist can make better speed. It would be
interesting if the next test of the sort could be made
across a strip of country held by an enemy or his
scouts.' That, would be a really exciting business.
Anyhow, that cycle corps must come. It is sad to
think of such a mass of splendid defence material
as the cyclists of Australia offer being allowed to run
to waste.
As far as the All-Aged Stakes at the
A.J.C. meeting goes to prove the relative values of
old and young stuff in the field, there seems to'have
been a blight on the foals of two and three seasons
back. Wolawa stands for about the best of the juve-
niles, but the Wallace colt was beaten by the three
four-year-olds at w.f.a., whilst they were easily beaten
by the two five-year-olds—Malt King and Lady
Medallist. The three-year-olds were simply not in
it. Excuses are offered for the Derby winners, Cisco
and Wilari, on the ground that they were off-color ;
also for Popinjay. But the fact remains that no
horse of their age, with the exception ,of the Tas-
manian colt Desire, has shown consistently good
“form’’ in competition with older horses this season.
All the rich, long-distance handicap stakes have gone
to five-year-olds. In the Metropolitan, Caulfield Cup,
Melbourne Cup and Australian Cup, both the winner
and runner-up were five-year-olds. The Sydney Cup
fell to a five-year-old. And never a young one wasi
placed in either of those five events. Australia hasn’t?
seen a brilliant three-year-old since Prince Foote'E
light went out.

Stayers of “Cup” quality are few. Tak£
the records of the three leading long-distance races
for the past six years. In 1907 the Sydney Cup wenj
to Realm, who had previously won the Australian
Cup. In 1908 the unlucky Tulkeroo ran second ip
both the Melbourne and Australian Cups. In 1909
Trafalgar won the Svdney (Didus coming third), anf
finished a close fourth for the Melbourne. Next year
Trafalgar was unlucky to lose Melbourne Cup by $
neck. In 1911 the Parisian won both the Australian
and Melbourne, the second in the Australian being
Apple Pie, who had been third in the previous Melt
bourns Cup, the third in last Melbourne Cup being
Djdus aforesaid. And now,,in 1912, Saxonite win-
at? Sydney, after running a dead-heat with Prize
fighter for the -Australian.

Onkaparinga (S.A.) had its usual success
on Easter Monday, the only day in the year on which
it races. Over £29,000 went through the totali t
sator, and the crowd probably panned out about onp
to the pound, for there are thousands of holiday-
makers who do not bet at this picnic meeting. The
300 or so motors, ranged on the hill in the middle
of the course, looked like a military camp. The
chief event —the Great Eastern Steeple of £IOOO---

THE CASE IS CLEAR.
The case is clear. On the one hand we have fountain pens that
splutter and leak—fountain pens that cannot be filled without a
bulb filler—that are in a word not themselves without this old-
fashioned friend, the filler. But in my hand here I have an
Onoto Ten—that cannot leak and that fills itself. A pen a child
can use—a pen no wise man would be without,
—You, sir, should own an Onoto Pen, it cannot leak.
—lt fills itself, it never splutters or scratches.
And it is British made. Now, is 12/- too much to pay for such a pen—
or a little more for the new G model. All stationers, jewellers and stores
sell it. Go to-day, while the evidence is fresh in your mind—to the nearest
stationer's and say—“ An Onoto Pen, please.”

London Crystal Palace, which had the “Festival
of Empire” as its summer attraction last year,
is getting up a Chinese exhibition for the approach-
ing merry month of May. According to the pros-
pectus it is going to “portray the lives and indus-
tries of the Chinese precisely as in their own coun-
try.” Mongolians will be seen working at every
known celestial trade, except crucifixion and the
exorcism of devils. A special feature is to be made
of Chinese cookery. A “famous Chinese chef” is to
he imported at great expense from Pekin. In the
extensive grounds attached to the Crystal Palace
there will be given every day a “grand spectacular
review of Chinese life and customs, from ancient to
modern times.” The Chinese camps at Ballarat and
Bendigo should send contingents to this pageant.
“0.K.”: The allegation that the late Emily Sol-
done was born in 1844 must have been borrowed
from her book of Recollections, written when the
old girl had settled down as a journalist in Sydney.
A number of other dates, taken from the same unre-
liable chronicle, by obituary notice writers, are
doubtless correct, but the idea that she was only 27
when she first appeared as Genevieve de Brabant at
a London suburban theatre is simply preposterous.
The extraordinary boom of Emily Soidene is one of
mv boyhood’s recollections, for I lived in the district
where she came to notoriety. The Philharmonic (or
Grand) Theatre, at Islington, was the first suburban
theatre (so-called) in London, and when “Genevieve”
was staged there it retained the form and many of
the fittings of the mere second-class music-hall it had
previously been. The new comic opera drew the
public from the swell parts of the town, and the old
Philharmonic Hall nearly fell down in amazement at
finding itself converted into a fashionable play-
house. The most wonderful circumstance of this
success was the fact that it radiated from anew
star, who was already getting on in years. Emily
Soidene achieved her celebrity in 1871, when she was
probably turned 40. She looked it, even on the
stage. Clara Vesev, a slim young woman, with a
fairly good voice, played an ingenue part in “Gene-
vieve,” and she was commonly reported to be Sol-
dene’s daughter. Moreover, she was understood to
be identical with the young woman who had sup-
ported her alleged mamma in a duet turn at the
music-halls in former days, when the chairman used
to knock his little hammer on his table (the chair-
man’s table being on the floor of the house, just
below the centre of the stage). and announce:
“Madame and Miss Soldeni will now appear.” The
sudden flashing of a middle-aged star into the
heavens of comic opera was the talk of the town.
People in general wanted to know what the bouncing
bold woman with the big voice and gigantic mouth
had been doing ere she got her chance in opera?
Then the old habitues of music-hall- called Madame
Soldeni to mind, and bethought them of the Madame
and Miss Soldeni of more recent vears, and the
mystery was explained. I reckon that Emily Sol-
dene's age last week was not less than 82.
The inconsistency of Asche’s humorous conception
of the beggar character in “Kismet” is accentuated
by his flippant ejaculations of “Glory be to Al-lah.”
lie rolls his tongue around “Al-lah” and smacks his
lips over the word as though he were consciously in-
viting a gallery laugh (which he is doing, of
course) ; nevertheless, the patiently revengeful nature
of Hajj, and his superstitious belief in divine ordina-
tion of small details in human life, seem to argue
that the roaring vagabond must take Allah quite
seriously. The man who cherishes religious beliefs
—especially Asiatic beliefs—is necessarily somewhat
Wowserlike in his references to a personal Almighty.
Hajj may be a happy-go-lucky thief and murderer,
equally ready to crack a joke or kill an enemy, but
his cynical views of life wouldn’t naturally lead him
into flippantly jocular praises of his God.
“Silas” : The Kinemacolor re-hash of the Delhi Dur-
bar, coming on the heels of weary miles of
Coronation gambols in Coekneyville, reveals with
how little beauty England is governed. The Corona-
tion pictures were intolerably dull excepting in strips,
when an Asiatic squad pranced past. The Durbar
films are full of interest and give us to see what
national processions should be, if people will persist
in making processions. There’s a pagan magnificence
where these Indian princes spread themseves. The
display is sumptuous—superb. There is art in it,
the hot, sunlit, gorgeous, bejewelled art of old Asia,
worthy of Oscar AVilde’s prose or Victor Daley’s
poetry. Here's the contrast, too—King George and
iris Queen, solid, comfortless and unsightly in dread-
ful ermine, among the rajahs in wonderful soft silks
of exquisite tints, draped with perfect taste. One can
almost forgive a nation for wanton extravagance if
only it has art.
“S.”: The fifth or sixth educated baboon
is now on exhibition in Melbourne, and 1
want the AVoman’s National League, or some-
thing of the kind, to drop politics, and de-
vote itself to the useful work of promoting an
anti-monkey movement. What is the Green Room
Club thinking of, anyhow, that it takes no steps to
suppress the ruinous competition of the cheap
simian ? This club is composed of vaudeville per-
formers, and the monkey that imitates a man has
abolished the man who imitates a monkey—certainly
the less of two evils. The baboon is always a source
of unwholesome humor, and the mor.e he resembles
man the more objectionable he is as a comedian.
Having descended from the apes, there should be no
return. Spare us the ignominy of going to the mon-
keys. It takes us all our time and money to go to
the dogs, and the slow horse and the female cat are
two of the roads that lead there.
Edward Terry, who passed out last week, was said
to be one of the most strictly economical mummers
in the profession. Away from the theatre he con-
cerned himself in suburban parish politics, and played
the churchwarden, and was—the writer believes—
an early member of London County Council. On
the stage Terry went through the mill. In his young
days he scored as a grotesque comedian in ex-
travaganzas at the little Strand Theatre (London),
which class of entertainment was finally extinguished
by the more expensive Gaiety burlesques. With his
own savings and the aid of a backer he became a
comedy theatre manager, and grew rich, “Sweet
Lavender” being his luckiest venture. Terry was not
a brilliant comedian, but he was clever and versatile
enough in quaint character parts. Australia under-
rated him because his methods as Dick Phenyl, in
“Lavender,” had been previously mimicked by Frank
Thornton. His other notable production in this
country was “Liberty Hall,” by R. C. Carton, where-
in he played a somewhat doddering old man. His
work in this was creative, but not very forcible.
“Liberty Hall” owed what success it achieved here-
abouts to its minor character sketches, one of them,
done by Polly Emery, reaching the limit in humorous
absurdity.
The moral of Amundsen's discourse is: “Look after
your dogs when you go Pole-hunting, and your dogs
will pull you through.”
“C Ocknev”: How history repeats itself! The
“Great Vance” bleated a “Mind the Paint” lyric
vears before Marie Lshr (who is now singing the
lines quoted by The Bulletin last week) was born.
The chorus of the old-time vaudeville star’s ditty
ran: —
Mind the paint! Mind the paint!
It won’t be dry for weeks !
Was it the paint on the door they meant,
Or the paint on the pretty maid’s cheeks?
Damphoolish, I grant you, but not more so than
Sir Arthur Wing Pinero’s latest effort.
“Storky”: In “The House of Temperley” the actors
and pugs, who demonstrate the noble art, introduce
too much of present-day methods, and fail to present
even a crude picture of the “all in” stoushings of
Tom Cribbs’s era. The men of those days were as
keen on the tricks of wrestling as cm the bare knuckle
wallop. For instance, Tom Sayers was renowned for
his cross-buttock, and many a fight it helped to win
for him. In the Williamson brawl there is an entire
lack of sensation, such as the old ring battles were
full of. The preliminary comic flounderings of Star-
light and Gray are out of place, and the person of
old Dad Nichoils as a 10 seconds' check is historically
absurd.
It was a coincidence that Edward Terry’s death
followed close on an appeal, in the London press,
for a benefit to Tom Thorne, his predecessor in
Strand burlesque. A lot of old Anglo-Australians
remember Tom Thorne as the brother mummer and
manager of David James (Belasco), whose son was
imported here by Willoughby to play lead in “The
Night of the Party.” Thorne and the original David
James went into management on their own, after
leaving the Strand —the firm including a beauty actor
named H. J. Montague—and they struck it rich with
“Two Roses,” “Our Boys,” and a series of revivals
of ancient comedies. The two staunch friends must
have been well in when they retired from business,
but, whereas David James had the Hebrew instinct
for accumulating wealth, Tom Thorne seemingly frit-
tered his fortune away in speculations. Now he is a
sick and needy old man, and the world that hasn't
quite forgotten him is asked to chase the wolf from
his bedroom door.
Roy Redgrave, of Bilanderson’s band, is getting
about slowly on two sticks. The dye from some
particularly virulent socks got into an old Boer
war injury on Roy’s leg, and put him out of the
limelight for a while.
“Vulcan”: The shareholders in Tiny Town, Ltd.
(mostly local or locally-employed Poverty Pointers,
by the way), are feeling pleased with themselves.
Beginning active business only in October last, the
co. has already paid four divs. The last was a 50
per cent, affair, and it was accompanied by a promise
of a fifth of a like amount, immediately after Easter.
Nor is this the end, by long chalks. The show is
going to S’Africa, and later to ’Frisco, where it pro-
poses to take a stand for the World’s Fair. There
can be no competition, as, though dwarfs are plenti-
ful enough, managing director Beaumont Smith has
practically cornered the world’s supply of physically
perfect midgets.
“Haresfoot”: Exit Edward Terry. Not of the Ellen
Terry clan, or apparently descended from Walter
Scott’s favorite comedian and chum, Daniel Terry.
It can be understood that Edward had more difficulty
than other comedians in making good, because of his
limited range. He hardly ever succeeded, except in a
part written round him. Byron first discovered how
Terry did well in the Strand in his old soldiers
and his ©ld sailors. Took also in such extrava-
ganzas as “Nemesis” and “El Dorado.” Toole was
acting at the Gaiety, then new, under Hollingshed,
with burlesques like “Aladdin” and “The Forty
Thieves,” Nelly Farren ‘being then on the rise, while
Kate Vaughan was the peerless and, indeed, original
skirt-dancer. Toole went to his little theatre, pre-
viously the Folly. Terry replaced him, with more
ficlat, in camaraderie with Royce and Nelly. Terry
advanced to opening Terry’s Theatre, a far better
spec than Toole’s. Byron having evanished, Pinero
took up the job of writing for Terry, who hit largely
in farces like “The Rocket,” “In Chancery,” and
“The Churchwarden.'' Terry was actually a church-
warden at Barnes, and used to go round with the
plate. He also read a kind of sermon at the Church
Congress, in emulation of Bancroft and Mrs. Kendal.
I don’t know whether he turned the thoughts of the
three Miss Vanbrughs to the stage. They were the
daughters, of Rev. Prebendary Barnes—not at Barnes.
Terry is alleged to have made £50,000 out of two
years’ run in Pinero’s “Sweet Lavender.” Vet he
declined “The Magistrate,” carefully written for
him. Cecil Clayton and Mrs. Wood got their year s
run out of it, followed by other years for “The
Schoolmistress” and “Dandv Dick.” Afterwards
Terry acted in “The Magistrate,” but the vogue was
gone. Long ago his attraction quite evaporated.
Yet, like Cruikshank, the stranded caricaturist, he
seemed to be as good as ever. Tried a burlesque of
“King Kodak” and other things. His son also acted
in Australia, like the son of Lai Brough, and son and
daughter of the Kendals.
“Star”: During the Easter manoeuvres five new
picture shows opened up in Melbourne and suburbs,
and in the city two more spacious theatres are being
rushed up, to "meet the popular greediness for films.
Theatrical managers do not complain, but publicans
do. 1 heard one Bung raving over an adjacent
continuous picture show, that had reduced his weekly
output by several barrels. Is it that the picture
showman rakes in the thrums and sprats publicans
money ?
“BECAUSE.”

OIL IN NEW ZEALAND.
AN ENTERPRISE OF MAGNITUDE.
What is perhaps the most important commercial
undertaking yet launched in New Zealand is now-
placed before the public in the shape of the Taranaki
N.Z. Oil Wells Ltd. That petroleum exists of high
quality at New' Plymouth has been testified to by
recognised authorities like Mr. J. D. Henry, the
eminent expert of London, and Dr. .1. M. Bell, re-
cently head of Geological Survey in New Zealand.
That it is there in quantity, there has of late been
ample evidence. Indeed, apart from other develop-
ments, there exists three flowing wells, alone yield
ing about 15,000 gallons of oil per week. Alto-
gether, the prospects are most promising.
When, however, we find associated with this im-
portant undertaking men of responsibility and posi-
tion like the Earl of Ranfurly, G.C.M.G.; Major
Dudley Alexander, C.M.G. ; Mr. Joseph Brailsford,
Chairman of one of the biggest Steel and Goal Cor-
porations in Great Britain; Mr. Andrew L. Horner,
K.C., M.P. ; Sir John Lane Harrington, K.C.M.G.,
Chairman of the Oil Trust Ltd. ; and Sir George
Clifford, Bart., of “Stonyhurst,” Christchurch, New
Zealand, all of whom, except the two latter, are
already on the Directorate —these last-mentioned hav-
ing arranged to join directly allotment has taken
place—it can be realised what good hands 'laranaki
Oil has at last got into.
The Capital of the new company will be £400,000,
of which a subscription of at least £150,000 is as-
sured by positive guarantee prior to the placing on
the market of this very fine property with its
remarkable scope for expansion.
The total area over which boring rights extend
is nearly 5000 acres.
Much is already arranged, and further develop-
ments are projected. A Refinery, for example, with
a capacity of 10,000 gallons per day, will be one of
the immediate provisions. Then, other equipment
of an equally up-to-date character will be introduced
by the Oil Trust Ltd., who, with their admitted
ability and great experience, have become the prac-
tical managers of the concern. A market for all
the petroleum that can be produced is practically
assured. It is estimated, indeed, that Australasia
alone, with its increasing demand in connection with
railways, shipping and motor transport, will render
The Taranaki N.Z. Oil AVeIH Ltd. independent of
that more distant trade which can afterwards be
cultivated, when other sources of oil supply are
tapped and made available.
We commend to our readers a careful study of the
Abridged Prospectus in connection with this im-
portant proposition. It is, as we have previously
stated, quite the most valuable enterprise that has
for many years paßt—if ever at all —been presented
for subscription in New Zealand*


The Subscription List is now open. It will definitely close on or before WEDNESDAY, APRIL 24. 1912.

PROSPECTUS.
OBJECTS.
This Company lias been formed for the primary purpose of acquiring and operating the
Coring rights of the Taranaki Petroleum Company, Limited, over proved and oil-pro-
ducing lands, and near the seaport of New Plymouth, in Taranaki, North Island, New
Zealand. '1 lie Company acquires the oil-producing rights over property at tidewater, a
drilling and operating equipment, and boring rights over three separate reserve territories
nnf e * selected as the result of expert advice founded upon indications of oil and gas.
ihe total area over which boring rights extend is, approximately, 4800 acres.
GOVERNMENT SUPPORT AND BONUS OF £lO,OOO.
j£>-no < l oV t riiment lias £rom time t 0 tirae made offer s Of £lO,OOO, allotted as follows: (a)
£-000 to be paid on proof being submitted that not less than 250,000 gallons of market-
able crude oil has been won ; (b) £2500 on 500,000 gallons; (c) £2500 on 1.000,000 gallons; (d)
the balance of £2500 to be paid to the person or company who first produces, by his or its
own refining plant, 500,000 gallons of refined mineral oil; the first claimant giving neces-
sary proof is to receive respective bonus.
PRELIMINARY OPERATIONS.
The Taranaki Petroleum Company, Limited, Brougham Street, New Plymouth, New
Zealand (nominal capital, £150,000), was formed in 1006. Five wells have been drilled on
the property to be operated by this Company ; in three of these oil was secured under
conditions fully described in the reports of the experts. A fourth well has now struck
oil, a recent telegram announces that the wells are at present flowing at the rate of 360
barrels per week. In order that the pioneers might benefit by the Government bonus
(above referred to), oil has been allowed to come to the surface by natural flow On
May 11, 1911, the pioneer Company was paid the first instalment (£2500) of the bonus on
the production of 250,000 gallons of “marketable crude oil.”
EXPERTS* REPORTS.
The British Empire Oilfields, Limited, having received most encouraging reports on the
properties, commissioned ML J. D. Henry to conduct investigations. This gentleman
had the assistance of well-known New Zealand experts, and associated with him in the
professional work done in connection with these properties is Dr. J. M Bell (Messrs
Bell & Fraser), who was, until recently, head of the Geological Survey in New Zealand
One statement made by Mr. Henry reads:—
“The property, in a more conspicuous degree than any other of which I have a
knowledge in the Colonies, has the primary essentials of an oilfield in which one can
with confidence recommend an investment of British and Colonial capital; it has
production, oil which, as analyses show, is of the very highest quality, and a position
at tidewater ensuring the easy and economical delivery of plant and export of the
crude and refined products.”
Dr Bell, In his Report, says:—
“The geological structure of the Taranaki district, New Zealand, together with
the production which has attended initial developmental work, indicates the existence
of an important oilfield. Of prime importance in the light of present knowledge are
the properties covered by this report, including, as they do, the Moturoa block, which
fringes New Plymouth Harbor and encloses wells yielding petroleum of the highest
. quality. These oil properties, which possess great potential value, are, from their
position, capable of more expeditious and economical deevlopment than any others
with which I am acquainted. Oil production here, considering the geographical
position which the Dominion holds, both from commercial and defence standpoints,
possesses unique advantages; and the more extensive exploitation of your Company’s
holdings affords a most promising enterprise for the investment of capital.”
FUTURE OPERATIONS.
The primary objects of this Company will be:—
(1) The erection of an up-to-date Refinery. (2) The immediate dispatch to New Zealand
of an expert drilling staff. (3) The immediate drilling of additional wells on the proven
property. (4) The gradual development of the reserve territories. (5) The organisation of
an oil sales department, and, generally, (6) The conversion of what has hitherto been a
purely local industry into a modern oilfield business with ample finance and a thoroughly
experienced management.
The .Minimum Working Capital (guaranteed by the Vendor Company under contract No.
3) will, in the opinion of the Company’s technical advisers, enable this Company to carry out
the above work in the most thorough and expeditious manner.
REFINERY.
The estimated cost of a refinery erected upon the property, and having a capacity of
]O,OOO gallons per day, is £23,000. As the output is increased this refinery can be added
to without any disturbance of the original erection.
QUALITY OF THE OIL.
Oil from the wells has been analysed by Messrs. A. F. Craig & Co., of Paisley, Scotland,
The conclusion of their Report reads as follows:
• “This is a crude petroleum of the most excellent quality, both as regards the
market value of the products obtained from it and the purity and character of these
products themselves. The petroleum is easily handled and refined at low cost, and
the solid paraffin can be extracted direct from the heavy oil from the first distillation
without any chemical treatment whatever, and is of excellent color and crystalline
structure.
“The spirit and finished kerosene are of first-class quality, water-white, and of
good smell.
“This crude petroleum in purity closely resembles the old pure Pennsylvanian
petroleum, but greatly excels it: in the extraordinarily high proportion of solid,
paralfin wax which it yields.
“We are aware of no natural petroleum which has been found to be so rich in
this valuable product.”
POSITION OF THE PROPERTIES.
The plots on which the wells have been drilled are, on their western boundary, within
150 yards of the seashore of New Plymouth Harbor. A public road and the State Branch
railway connects New Plymouth with the wharves and breakwater.
The Company’s Experts say:— “The geographical relationship of the field to the harbor,
the land gradient, and the depth of water at the loading point enable us to say that the
property has unsurpassed positional advantages.”
MARKETS.
The well-known protective policy of the Dominion ensures operators an unassailable
home market, while, when an export business has been organised, Australia should take
all the surplus oil produced. Therefore these oil resources can be developed regardless of
foreign operations or competition. -
Mr. Henry concludes his Report upon the properties as follows:
“The entire proposition can be recommended on the ground that it is complete
in every detail, embracing, as it does, the production, refining, and marketing of
petroleum under the most favorable, economic and trading conditions in one of the
most progressive Colonies of the Empire.”
The Company wilt pay a brokerage of sixpence per Share on all Shares allotted to persons
other than subunderwriters, on application forms bearing a broker’s stamp.
The preliminary expenses are estimated at £6000; inclusive of amount payable to the
British Empire Oilfields, Limited, but exclusive of brokerage.
IT IS INTENDED TO ESTABLISH A NEW ZEALAND REGISTER OF SHAREHOLDERS
IN DUE COURSE.

haunted, or had the traveller provided himself with
some particularly bad whisky before setting out on
his lonely tramp? The previous traveller who never
returned to the township may simply have cleared
out of the district by another route, and started a
grocery business elsewhere... .C.A.F.: Verse seems to
have been laboriously dragged together. Heavy,
commonplace work....A. A. Allan: The twin of your
“Give me, O Lord, a Man” rhyme has appeared in
half the “Comic” rags in Christendom.... Philos:
Two verses will suffice to incriminate you as a typical
“Liberal”: —
If sailirtg along at the present rate,
There is sure to be collisions.
When thoughtful citizens see to what fate,
They are driven by Caucus decisions.
Each State within itself supreme,
Must be in local Legislation
When Measures co to the extreme
Then follows Tribulation.
L.M.: Poems in the old moke manner, beginn-
ing:
There were horses nominated for the coming City Cup,
There were Jockeys coming from the Sydney side,
And “Polly Queen” was entered with old “Barden’s”
colors up,
That noble mare that I was going to ride,
are invariably handed the death-stroke. Horse-
poetry has become, as it were, the velocipede or
freetrade of literature- —something that is hopelessly
out of vogue... .Outback: You remark: —
The artificial city life
Is fraught with vice and with strife
It wakes the human beings bad.
Thank God, I’m still a country lad.
And yet, pious friend, we have observed a dash of
frivolity, not to say downright naughtiness, in the
baekblocks in our time.... Haytim: Quite credit item
re Lascar toilers on P. and 0. ship. In fact, it is so
infernally credible, not to say commonplace, that it
is not worth printing... .Ivory: Nice, easy lot of
rhymes. But they supply no poetical thought or
humor or observation, and so they fail— .Q. Sinnell:
Having battled through one page of your weird chiro-
graphy, or, to put it plainly, rotten handwriting, we
turned the blastiferous tissue-paper which you affect
over, and found that you had disfigured both sides
of the stuff with inkmarks. In ith of a second your
contribution was in the basket. It (the contribu-
tion) is there still... .Kobbi: If you’ll describe the
grasshopper trap so that we can understand it, we’ll
band it on to a long-suffering country. Description
to hand is as vague as Digby Denham’s policy....
Ormsley: Quite a common thing in will-making...
Niac: Try again.... Holy Smoke: Well, here it is:—
CHARTREUSE.
(Written for The Bulletin.)
In French Alps, whose peaks lift icy scalps
Lies Chartreuse Monastery. The gloomy pines in
dark green.
And snow often whitens the scene
I was drawn there by stories told
About men of the world who sought this fold
Yet found none such the hospitable Monks among
But stories were upon each tongue
Which here I try to generalise
Of Men who sought a Worldly prize
And failed. They came to this abode
And thus the storms of life outrode.
A Woman there was in most or all cases
Reveries of beautiful and deceptive faces
Gowns seemed to rustle the Chartreuse through
Yet none were ever there apparent to the view.
Remember now that here I plough up Centuries of
Time
In overwhelming matter for my rhyme.
Soldiers from Henri Quatre, the Louises, and Bona-
parte,
Men whose luck was far below their art.
But yet I say the name of Lover
Would a vast majority of Chartreuses cover.
Ah, what a Pantechnicon of nods, becks, smiles,
With every trick by which the Fair beguiles!
The cowled Monk his inward Portrait Gallery carries
through the years
Like Esau seeks a place of penitence with tears.
Or rather has his pent-up wrath implacable
To subdue which the Father Confessor’s never able.
“My Son, Cultivate the Spirit of New Birth”
“Father, I’ll ne’er succeed upon this Earth”
“Mv Son, in Sorrow as in Joy, remember day by day
The Motto: ‘This, too, shall pass away.’”
Chartreuse has had its Statesmen, Courtiers, in each
age
And many woes connected with the Stage
Really I think the Actresses have sent more men
Than any other women to this den.
Oh, that wicked Theatre! Moths out of its candle
To Chartreuse came, and tried to bury scandal.
I even heard of a Monk Manager who had a pretty
wife
Unable to bear the Sun glare of her life
A woman with the spirit of a Suffragette
Ne’er sent a man to any Chartreuse yet.
So let the Ladies never singe our wings
But study in the Blue Books, and such things.
TO ARTISTIC (AND INARTISTIC)
CONTRIBUTORS.
N.C.W.: Some kindly remarks might be made
about the picture, but the gag is quite harmless and
would peck out of the hand.... Tim B.: A large col-
lection and a very poor shot... .8.L.R.: Fairly good
for a pun, but only a pun at best... .W.F.1.: The
remark which the ill-proportioned perpendicular man
is making to the man, apparently without Tegs, who
sits in front of what looks like four bandboxes is
not calculated to interest the public Tim B.: Your
picture of Josiah Thomas wouldn’t be recognised by
that gentleman’s worst enemy G. Eley: Unhesita-

Mark the differences
between the
Square Tread
and an ordinary cover:
A tyre which is most artistically sculptured—
a thing of ribs and lumps, hollows and humps
is one of the fads nowadays. Such grooves
reduce the thickness of the tread and make
it proportionately weaker.
h
fh
The Michelin Square
Tread, as you see, is a plain
cover. Therefore, it is just so
much the thicker and stronger.
Moreover, the common practice is to
make casing and tread separately. These
are then stuck together.
But the Michelin Square Tread is all
one piece. In this case the cover is put
into a mould, and both canvas and
rubber, under great hydraulic pressure,
are vulcanised together. When it leaves
the mould, therefore, the cover is a
homogeneous whole: every part is
absolutely regular.

Kuring-gai Railway Station, 17 miles from Milson’s Point, is the
highest point anywhere near Sydney, commanding splendid views of
beautiful Cowan Bay and abutting on famed Kuring-gai Chase.
Its very height—7o2ft. above sea level, ensures cool, bracing air
and complete change from the city and suburbs. Besides this advan-
tage and the beauty of the district, Nature has provided other things
for man’s happiness and profit, such as unsurpassed fishing and boat-
ing areas, and good soil for Orchards and Gardens.
Lovers of nature, investors, speculators and home-makers will
soon have the opportunity of a lifetime to secure portions of one of
the most desirable and highly prospective estates yet offered near Syd-
ney.

Make a note of it, as an opportunity like this is not the everyday kind,
and with the possibilities of the proposed North Shore Bridge and Electrifica-
tion of Suburban Railways, as well as the rapidity of travel by Motor-Car,
nobody knows what the prospective development in values will be.
The Estate is already a favorite place for homes, and is within easy
access of two main lines of railway. Only 17 miles from Milson’s Point and
25 miles via Strathfield.
The Railway Commissioners evidently forecasted its future by building
a fine large platform.

WINCHESTER
Self-Loading Shotgun
12 GAUGE, MODEL 1911
The Winchester Self-Loading Shotgun has all the good points of other
recoil-operated shotguns and also many distinctive and exclusive features
which sportsmen have been quick to appreciate and endorse. Among them are
Nickel steel construction throughout; a receiver made with the Winchester
patented “Bump of Strength ” which gives the gun surpassing strength and
safety ; divided recoil, which minimizes the “ kick” to the last degree; and a
reloading system which requires no readjustment for different loads. The
Winchester Self-Loader will shoot any standard load from a “ Blank ” to the
heaviest with certainty and safety, without tinkering the action. Also it is a two-
part take-down without any loose parts. These are only a few of the many
good points about this gun. To fully appreciate its superiority you should see it

Captain Nutting, of the Denman staff, who
was instrumental in placing the polo game
firmly on its four legs, now talks of return-
ing to England. A few damsels hereabout
dreamed of being asked to say “Yes” to liis
comfortable income; but the dream is fading
fast.
News is to hand that dainty Mrs. Dan
Lazarus and her husband, wdiilst returning
from a ball at Cairo, were cast roughly upon
the surface of Egypt by a large motor. Mrs.
Lazarus was shaken most; but none of the
party were shaken very badly, and Egypt
escaped without a scratch.
Canadian Consul D. H. Ross, of this city,
the good-looking benedict who abides at
South Yarra, has news of his father’s death.
Senator Ross was an old member of the
Canadian Legislature and a keen man on
defence matters. His patriotism carried
him to the ripe age of 97. Ross, of this side;
is trade commissioner as well as consul for
his country. Like his honored dad, he is
very fond —in a Scotchman’s way—of his
native land, and gives it his moral support
at a great distance.
Nellie Veitch, who has been the closest
friend of Ethel Irving since the visiting star
arived in Australia, was the last to say good-
bye. Miss Irving and Mr. Ewart spent
Tuesday evening at Genevieve, the Veitch
house that was named after their mutual
friend, Genevieve Ward.
A case from the sunken Pericles came
ashore in Westralia the other day, and the
finder opened it, and discovered two oil
paintings rather the worse for washing.
The owner of the paintings, a man who had
shipped (uninsured) several cases of curios
too valuable to be disposed of in Australia,
yprote to the discoverer of his lost treasures
and asked him what he thought was a fair
reward for his salvage services. A reply
wandered back: “Three thousand pounds.”
A correspondence then commenced or set
in, until the person on the beach agreed to
knock off £2993. A cheque for £7 then flew
westward on the wings of the post, and the
damaged paintings started home again.
The dancing man grows younger and less
numerous every season. The age limit has
now almost dropped to knickerbockers; and
as his years diminish so do his manners.
The other night, a little knock-up dance,
which was to have followed a big dinner,
had to be struck off the programme because
the two-stepping males, as soon as the feed-
ing was quite over, muttered “Goo’-night,”
and hastened off ere the band had time to
tune its instruments. Intending hostesses
will do well to accept this intimation. The
young feeders must be secretly leg-roped by
an adroit waiter who professes to be merely
handing the coffee.
“It’s an expensive job getting married
these days,” remarked the society cadet in
the gloomy manner adopted by his dad when
confronted with mamma’s accumulated bills.
“First bad move was when that chap gave
diamond rings to the bridesmaids. Now I
hear St. Paul’s choristers are objecting, be-
cause they can’t get sixpence apiece for sing-
ing at weddings, or perhaps they are kicking
because they’re not getting sixpence that they
used to get—l get so mixed up between all
these strikes and things. Anyhow, I know
it’s dashed expensive, and you want to be
jolly careful about getting engaged.” Then
he ignited another scented cigarette, and
the smoker of plain tobacco at the next table
got up and went out with the air of a suf-
fering martyr.
A young Society matron invited a pal to
her country house for a week-end’s “petrol-
ling.” The friend translated it wrongly,
and arrived, armed with dustcoat and
goggles, to find her hostess busy cleaning
clothes in the sewing room. What the good
housewife had meant by “petrolling” was a
general wardrobe overhaul, with the help of
a pint of the stuff that animates hubby’s car.
Blanche Marchesi is coming from London
to visit Melba at Coombe Cottage, it is said.
Now 755 Australian soprano voices, likewise
116 contralto ditto, and three and a half dozen
assorted tenors, baritones and basses will
tremble with emotion at the thought of get-
ting a hearing from Melba and Marchesi at
one fell swoop. It goes without saying that
they haven’t Buckley’s chance of breaking
through the cordon of bulldogs and shooers-
nff that the distinguished Coombe Cottager
will place around the premises what time her
foreign guest is within.
A white-haired patriarch was shown
through the G.P.O. lately. He had retired
from the service 35 years ago, and owned
up to the substantial age of 102. He
watched the staff at work with bated breath
—he had been a sorter in his time, a.nd
reckoned he wasn’t too slow at the job. Like
Rip Van Winkle, he wandered round where
no one knew him, until he suddenly saw a
face he thought he had met there of yore.
“I remember you as a little codger,” he
wheezed; and the “little codger,” now get-
ting bald and grey-haired, grasped the
ancient’s claw-like hand. Then he showed
him the English mail coming in by the lorry-
load —and the old man nearly fell to pieces
with astonishment. “You won’t get through
it ” lie muttered; and he gathered up
his uifibrella and chaperone and left, with
an air of being rather thankful he • had
turned down the job when it wasn’t quite
so extensive. By the way, his remark about
the not getting a mail through was quite
up-to-date. The Bulletin has had recent
experiences of sinful delays in mails from
Melbourne.
Weddings frequently prove fatal to the
bridesmaids and groomsmen. The best man
at a recent Society knot-tying is casting
affectionate looks at the bride’s sister, and
friends think that another shower of pre-
sents will have to be found some time in the
near future.
Here is a story about a man who may be
described as economical. While lie was
carrying on a race-time flirtation with an
adorable grass widow, the grass widower de-
cided suddenly to run down from the squat-
tage and pleasantly surprise his wife. On
the evening of his arrival, the economist had
booked stalls for himself and the widow. The
husband’s return, of course, cancelled the
proposed excursion. But the economist did
not tear up the tickets or give them to the
boots at his hotel. He sold them to the
husband.
Yours affectionately.

IN
BANANA LAND
The Federal Situation in Queensland.
The visit of Prime Minister Fisher to
Queensland, where the State election is in
full blast, may yet develop into a complica-
tion. The recent upheaval at Brisbane,
which is almost the only subject of discus-
sion in the present campaign, was a case of
Strike v. Arbitration. The original dis-
agreement concerned the right of the Bris-
bane tramway unionists to wear their union
badges while at work. The matter was re-
ferred to the Federal Arbitration Court,
presided over by a Judge who commands the
greatest possible respect, and whose demo-
cratic sympathies have caused Fat to curse
on many occasions, but before the Judge had
a chance to give his decision (which was in
favor of the unionists), certain wild-eyed
and hot-headed union leaders rushed their
followers into the famous General Strike.
If they had won they would have had the
same justification as any other successful in-
surrectionists. Also, the roar, and the lime-
light and the processions and the banners
would have all been advertisement for them,
whereas if they had stuck to the plain, dull-
brown methods of legal procedure, the credit
for the victory would have gone partly to
the lawyers who argued the case for Labor,
and partly to the Federal Judge who gave
the decision in favor of Labor. As it befell,
the strike leaders lost their own battle, and
they nullified the victory which the tramway
employees gained in the court, for, when the
law decided that these men were entitled to
wear their badges while at work, they had—
by their own act, and thanks to their ab-
surd commanders—no work to wear their
badges at. To put it shortly: Labor has
toiled long and earnestly to get Industrial
Arbitration, and now certain Queensland
Labor potentates, who are themselves pledged
to the arbitration principle, have declared
war against it, and claim the right to de-
nounce every Laborite who doesn’t back-
slide along with them. And it is impossible
to guess why they did so except that they
regarded the General Strike as more spec-
tacular and rockety, and a better advertise-
ment for themselves, than a quiet, orderly,
legal victory; that they considered the Labor
movement as designed for their own glory
rather than for the good of the people; and
that they woefully mistook their own capacity
as leaders of a great rising. They took
themselves for Cromwell or Bolivar or San
Martin, and they were nothing of the sort.
Now, as the bulk of the Labor candidates
belong to the Coyne push, the people of
Queensland are placed in a false position.
They may vote for the crowd which, judged
by its acts, believes in strikes and is against
arbitration, or they may vote for the other
crowd which is equally against arbitration
and strikes. And Prime Minister Fisher,
who professes to believe in arbitration, has
gone to Queensland, either in the interests
of the anti-arbitration and general strike
crowd, or in the interests of the Denham
gang, or simply to look at the scenery. A more
diplomatic man would have found it neces-
sary to inspect the route of the Port
Augusta-Port Darwin railway, or the Port-
Augusta-Ivalgoorlie railway. He -wouldn’t
have transpired in Queensland till the Fed-
eral elections were nearly due. Then he would
have appeared as the strenuous advocate
of Federal arbitration and Federal control
of industrial legislation. And if he was
asked to express his opinion of Coyne he
would have replied that Coyne so far as the
Australian Government was concerned, was
only an individual voter, and that it was
no part of his business to express oninions
about individual voters. No man can take
THE DANGERS OF TOWN.
BILL SLIPRAILS (recounting his adventures in Sydney): “ Oh, yes, I went to the theaytre
all right, but all of a sudden the blessed lights went out. I tell you, I did a bunk
pretty quick. Yer can never tell when them blessed things’ll explode. Now, wot
they want in a place like that is a couple o’ good oil lamps.”
a hand in Queensland State politics just now
without being more or less against the arbi-
tration principle, which is a leading feature
of the Labor policy; because one party is
against arbitration by reason of its Fat and
its Toryism, and the other is against it by rea-
son of the insane vanity of its leaders, and
their over-estimation of their own capacity.
Therefore, Queensland is a good place to
keep away from. Probably the best way to
save it for the Federal Labor party, later on,
is to let Coyne and his friends lose it now
for the State Labor party. In the past,
Coyne and his friends have always lost
Queensland in a State Labor sense, whereas
Fisher and his friends have been very suc-
cessful in gaining it in a Federal Labor
senke. In these circumstances, it would be
sheer madness to hamper the seaworthy
Federal vessel of Fisher by tying it to the
always waterlogged State ark of Coyne.
Back in Town.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I've been to see the blessed bush
Where bunyips riot free,
And now my turn has come to gush
And lift a melody;
I’ve ate my ’taters with my knife
And gaily washed ’em down
With gallons free of billy tea—
And now I’m back in town.
The wayside pub—a stopping place
For gallant Cobb and Co.,
In all its wild romantic grace
It did delight me so ;
The Boss —he knew you in a trice,
And with his fist so brown
Would grip you like a friendly vice,
Thank lleav’n— he’s not in town.
1 liked to gaze through Western haze
On leagues of Mitchell grass ;
I joyed to watch the jumbucks graze
And hear the gay jackass;
But Oh! I say—my heart was gay
At sight of Someone’s gown
The day my feet made haste to meet
A lass in Brisbane town.
Of course I love the blessed bush,
And dote upon the drought;
I do admire the shearing push
And all their merry rout;
But ice is here to cool the beer,
There’s concert, circus, clown,
And city girls are smiling near—
Thank God—l’m back in town !
QUEENSLAND.
PHILANDER F.
QUEENSLAND GOSSIP.
Brisbane, April 13, 1912.
My Dear Thargomindah,—
The military camps have been the centre
of mild attraction for the past few days.
Last Sunday infantry officers moved a
battalion of women into position and charged
them with buns, tea and other modern am-
munition. On Tuesday, the Macgregor over-
hauled the troops and declared them to be
sound in wind and limb, and on Monday he
is scheduled to pass an unbiassed opinion on
the field guns. In the best informed circles
it is rumored that the opinion will be favor-
able, even if his Ex. has to smother his feel-
ings in the process.
Amundsen, the man who carved his name
on the South Pole, is lodging at Govern-
ment House when he is not addressing aud-
iences on the advantages of sledge dog as an
article of diet. To-day their Exes, gave a
rn-°r trip in honor of his visit, and, as usual
with the Macgregor entertainments, it pleas-
ured everybody / who attended. In these
times of grief and pain, to say nothing of
nerves, marriage and bad whisky, not even
the most hard-working member of the In-
dustrial Union of Associated Governors
could do more.
On Wednesday Captain Frank Newton
married Miss Kathleen Verney, of England.
Archbishop Donaldson, garbed in circus
scarlet, and aided by Canon Pattinson, did
the hitching. Auntie gave away the bride, who
was equipped in white satin crgpe with ex-
quisite Buckinghamshire lace, the elder lady
being upholstered in black. Parson Batty
and another Verney sister were the referees.
Later, a reception was held at the pretty
home of Mrs. Peter Macgregor, who is a sis-
ter qf the groom. She looked charming in
a pale tan-colpred ninon and a hat of black
satin and golden brown. The newly-weds
fled towards the Tweed, but ill-fortune still
pursued them. At Southport the groom,
while looking for remembered beauty spots,
disappeared into a chasm or an abyss or
something, and hurt his knee so badly that a
neighboring medicine man had to be hur-
ried forward with a repair kit.
On Wednesday afternoon, E. D. Miles and
wife entertained the Charters Towers Male
Choir, which, after competing in the Bun-
daberg Eisteddfod, had come on to Brisbane.
The occasion was seized or embraced to pre-
sent a purse of sovereigns to Conductor
Bichard Hall, in appreciation of his talent,
hard graft, and a few other virtues, after
which the choir unanimously burst into song
and departed fortissimo for the North.
Winnie Payne, daughter of Hospital
Secretary Payne, will shortly wed Dr.
Crolle, a medical laborer in the vineyard of
Brisbane Hospital. A garden party is
afoot.
The races on Saturday and Monday were
well attended, and some very pretty frocks
were paraded for the joy of beholders. Lady
Verney and her two nieces, with the Newton
clan, wandered over the lawn. Miss Kath-
leen Verney was in cream lace, which also
enveloped Mrs. Cockie, a sister of Captain
Newton. Miss Jean Turner sported a differ-
ent imported frock each day. On Saturday
it was a concoction of lace and muslin, with
a big black hat to top off with; on Monday
a white ninon, with a tiny brown line, and
a black hat festooned with honeysuckle.
Novel and becoming, like a democratic idea
in a speech by Digby Denham.

After undergoing a spring cleaning, the
Exhibition organ was put through its paces
on Wednesday night. The large hall was
three-parts full and the trams home three-
parts fuller. The musical element, however,
considered that the discomfort and incon-
venience of the journey had been well repaid,
and as the horse-racing element and the two-
up element were not present, owing to an
oversight or something, the comnlaints were
few.
Yours affectionately,
AUSTRALIA JANE.
The Denham crowd is running some 11
lawyers for various seats this election. The
manifest inclination of Fat to entrust him-
self politically, body and soul, to the tender
mercies of Gent. One is the most charming
tribute ever paid to the profession.
With the departure from the ranks of
Dan Mulcahy (of Gympie), the Queensland
Labor party can boast that no fewer than 25-
of its Parliamentary representatives (in-
cluding five leaders or deputy-leaders) have
left its ranks, mostly under compulsion.
The Labor party, very unwisely, is run-
ning some five or six members of the late
strike committee for seats in and around.
Brisbane. The Tory party, on the other-
hand, is running some seven special con-
stables who brandished the baton in the;
cause of Law’n Order.
“Kobbi”: Rockhampton, which has just:
selected its first council since the abolition;
of the ward system, chose its first group of
civic fathers ’way back in ’6l. The body
started out by discounting a bill for £3OO
with a Brisbane bank, and it has been from
neck to waist deep in debt ever since.
Some time ago it was announced that
Innisfail (Geraldton) had been knocked out
in the matter oPrain record by Port Doug-
las. The former town, however, has just
regained its prestige. A few days ago it
proudly boasted of having opened the sluices
of Heaven to the tune of 33 inches in two
days.
Brisbane Chinese chartered a boat re-
cently to carry them to Redcliffe, where they
held a big shivoo in honor of the downfall
of the Manchu dynasty. Any_ European
or Australian association would have cadged
the Lucinda off the Government -for politi-
cal rejoicings. John is not half the white
man he fancies he is.
“Kobbi” : The Dawson Valley line will be
finished—some day. The boring undertaken
by the Government is complete. Some 50
holes prove that coal exists on both sides of
the Dawson River in workable areas, though
the country is extremely disturbed. The bill
for the last year’s boring was £3779, but the
Government should get this back —by-and-
bye.
Ivessell, the Denham candidate for Port
Curtis (Gladstone), is a man of promise,
and the things he hopes to do the township
if he is made an M.£300.A. are many. Among
others he trusts to get
(1) A grammar school.
(2) A technical college.
(3) A water supply scheme out of loan money.
(4) An agricultural college.
(5) lie has a promise from Denham and Appel
that, if the Callide coal proves marketable, a railway
will be built.
But Gladstone has lived very long on a diet
of promises, and has filled its stomach with
the east wind until it is tired and gassy.
What it wants is a plain ordinary railway
in a north-westerly direction to join the
Longreach line, and a fair chance to Com-
pete on even terms with Rockhampton—the
misplaced town that is too far up the unfor-
tunate river—for the trade of the west. That
is also the sort of thing that Bowen wants,
and neither is likely to get it.

This time last year the “CHALMERS” CAR was unknown to Australia.
To-day there are 92 running, all sold within 12 months.
Eighty per cent, of these Cars have gone to Country Clients, because the Car
is now recognised throughout New South Wales as the most suitable Car for the
Stock and Station Agents, Hotelkeeper and Squatter, and the Run About for the
Professional Man. *
You ask : Explain how it is the “CHALMERS” is acknowledged as the best Car
for Country Work?—Because they are high-powered, light, yet strongly built, and
cost very little for upkeep.
Refer to any of our Clients with respect to upkeep, and they will tell you how
they get from 6000 miles to 8000 miles on their tyres, and average 25 miles to
the gallon of petrol. Ask them what their repair bill has been. We know their
answer —Nil!
These facts justify the “CHALMERS” in being named the Champion Country
Car.
Let us post you a 1912 Catalogue.

HER LITTLE GIRL’S
HAIR ALL CAME OFF
Trouble Like Ringworm. Very Itchy,
Could Not Sleep. Tried a Lot of
Remedies to No Avail. Had Not
Used One Pot of Cuticura Oint-
ment Before She Was Cured.
“The trouble that affected my little girl
started in her head like ringworm Then it
•j X
nr~
went all over her head.
The head swelled and it
went in the form of mat-
ter and all the hair came
off her head. It was very
itchy. She could not
sleep, and I began to
think she would never
get better. I tried a lot
of advertised remedies,
but all to no avail. She
was like this for over
three months until I
tried a pot of Cuticura
Ointment. I had not
used that pot before she
was completely cured. The hair grew again,
and you would never know that there had
been anything wrong with her head.”
(Signed) Mrs. P. J. Collins. Merlwood, Humf-
fray St. North, Ballarat East, Vic., Dec. 5, ’lO.
A Generation of Success
To go through life tortured and disfigured
by itching, burning, scaly and crusted skin
and scalp humours is unnecessary. For
more than a generation, warm baths with
Cuticura Soap and gentle applications of
Cuticura Ointment have proved successful
in the most distressing cases, of infants,
children and adults, when all else fails.
Cuticura Soap and Ointment are sold through-
out the world. A liberal sample of Cuticura
Ointment, with a 32-page book on the skin
and hair will be sent free on application to

IMMEDIATE RELIEF
obtained by the use of Dr. Scheuble’s Samol, the
latest discovery for the treatment of Rheumatism,
Gout, Sciatica, Eczema, and kindred complaints.
The following is one of hundreds of unsolicited
testimonials received from people who have received
benefit from the use of this new treatment:—
York Road, Beecroft, Vie., June 7, 1911.
“Dear Sir,—My husband had suffered with sciatica
for over 18 weeks, and had been under Doctor’s
treatment, but got no relief. I was looking at the
paper and saw your advertisement of ‘Samol’ being
good for Sciatica, and I sent and got a tube. The
first application gave relief and sleep, which he had
not had for 18 weeks.
“I have recomended it to four different friends of
mine, and they all found it a great benefit to them.
“(Signed) (Mrs.) S. A. BOWERMAN.”
Samol is sold in tubes, price Is. 6d., 3s. 9d., and

FOR
INDIGESTION
BILIOUSNESS
CONSTIPATION
HEADACHE
If you cannot digest your food perfectly you
cannot be well. The slightest failure on the
part of the stomach, liver 'or intestines, reacts
on your whole system, and reacts harmfully.
Not only is your body starved because you have
failed to get the full nourishment from what you
have eaten, but it is also poisoned. For in-
digestion loads your blood with poisonous
impurities which your own stomach has created,
and the blood carries these to every part of your
body. Naturally your strength fails. You
become weak and ailing, tortured with headache,
biliousness, perhaps constipation (which still'
further contaminates your blood), and life
becomes a daily misery. Mother Seigel’s Syrup
will free you from all this. It so tones and
strengthens your stomach and liver that indi-
gestion becomes impossible. It also regulates
your bowels, and cleanses your whole system.

suffered from terrible pains in the stomach
after eating. I could only take the lightest
nourishment and even tl at was frequently

Syrup I was . cured, and I have kept well

“Boswell”: “Cheer-oh” must have been imbued
with a spirit of- pure cussedness when he (B. 7/3/’l2)
undertook to correct me for my remarks anent the
palpable brainlessness of Clarence River (N.S.W.)
maize cockies in their boycott of their local market.
His “explanation” of the alleged chains which bind
cocky to Sussex-street is pure bunkum. The herd of
commission blokes in that congested thoroughfare
hardly constitute a blood brotherhood of such perfect
love as “Cheer-oh” depicts. As a matter of fact,
cocky can scab on them by selling locally 364 days
in the year, and on the 365th place a consignment
in “the street” with ease. Good commissions do not
go begging there. In my par. I did not mention any
“local 25-bag buyer.” What I did mention was that
a Clarence buyer offered to take the whole 1500 bays
at Sydney rates, and secured only 25 bays. In short,
I referred to a 1500-bag buyer, who got all he re-
quired except the odd 1475 bags, which was a mere
trifle, like “Cheer-oh’s” argument. My righteous in-
dignation was aroused by the suspicious manner in
which these dullards shied at the local man, be-
cause, forsooth, in some mysterious, unspecified way,
in the unspecified future, he would “have them some
other way.” My objection to their conduct lies, not
in their sending their surplus to dear old Sydney,
but in their whole hog support of centralisation,
while professing the reverse. Whether a deep-sea
port on their individual doorsteps would wean them
of the Sydney disease is problematical —in this gen-
eration, anyhow. [This discussion stops right here,
just as if it were cut off with an axe like the head of
Chas. I.— Ed. Bulletin.]

“Tiaki”: The man from the land of Fried Nigger
is engaged in painting the Southern Hemisphere. The
agent of a big Yankee firm strikes Jones, of Wool-
ville, and gives him the sole agency for Brumm’s
Stickfast Paints. He then goes to Brown, and gives
him the exclusive right of advertising and selling
Thunder’s Lightning Shades Paint. He next confers
on Green the one and onlv right of smearing the
public with Bullblither’s Great Take-down Paint,
Having conferred these benefits on the storekeepers,
and sold them two or three hundred pounds’ worth
of Never Fade Paint, he leaves.
“When day dawned we could see some big sharks
swimming just off the wreck.” Every rescued mar-
iner hereabouts seems to-make the same remark after
scrambling ashore. Apparently the shark has the-
true undertaker instinct, and is able to smell disaster
at long range; at any rate, he cuts alo-ng to the
marine deathbed with promptitude, and remains on
hand without regard to meal times. B’or attention
to business and the expert handling of rush orders,
the deep-sea firm of Grey, Nurse and Co. beats the
land agent hollow.
* * * *
The clerk’s lot always was hard, but that charac-
teristically Yankee excrescence, the “business maga-
zine,” has made it still harder. The seasoned
clerk takes a deadly revenge on the impudent, cheese-
paring publications by refraining from buying them.
But the green graduate from the business college is
liable to buy one or other of them regularly, and to
take the contents for commercial gospel. Being
fairly ravenous for hints as to the quickest method
of doing the boss for his job, he thankfully, accepts
such stuff' as the following, and never dreams of re-
senting it : “A clerk has to do more than he is paid
for before he can attract attention. Then the increase
of salary must come.” No magazine ever seems to
offer “advice” of that sort to lawyers or bricklayer?,
and tbe grocer is never counselled to try and better
himself by giving two pounds of sugar for the price
of one. The clerk alone is told that he must burn
up his energy and present the boss with £4 worth
of work for £3. ,

“Klifton”: Consider the bicycle fraud. Smith
decides to get rid of his old machine, and invest in
one more in accordance with his requirements. He
goes to Brown, the manufacturer, with his order, and
is allowed so much on the cast-off bike. Brown
incidentally urges that the said cast-off should be
handed in at once, as he has a customer who will
surely buy it. Smith agrees, and is loaned another
bicycle pending the completion of the new one.
Then Brown leaps in the air and gets busy. He
sends the cast-off machine to his workshops, has it
taken to pieces, cleaned, the frame or other portions
altered to conform with the requirements of "Smith,
fits on new tyres and nickel, and varnishes the two-
wheeled steed in the color agreed upon. Or he mav
take three hopeless ruins to pieces and compound
two new bikes out of the fragments. All of
which being completed, the result is. in due time,
handed to Smith a newly-built bicycle. And, as
far as I know, not a solitary Smith has tumbled to
the swindle.
“Pohutukawa”: The lost Loonvana was nothing
like 33 years m the Islands, as alleged by a Bulle-
tin writer. The fact is, it was but 33 years old.
It was built at Hobart, or thereabouts, to renlace
the Bella Mary, which carried pab'-n<rs and fruit
between Hobart and Auckland. It faithfulv did the
B.M.’s iob till the steamers ran it off, and not till
then did it go into the cockroach trade.
THE BOARDER’S CHOICE.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Let me revert to the question of hides; Tanners
have to pay, at the very lowest, 7d. per pound for
light material in its natural state. Seven years ago
they had to pay but half that sum, and 20 years ago
they could be got at 2id. per pound. Now they are
h«ird to get at 7d. —the price of a rump steak. —
Authority on boots, explaining why footwear is going
» be more expensive.
The boarder sawed —
And gnawed—
And chawed.
The boarder slashed —
And gashed.
Then back he fell and mopped his brow, and mut-
tered, “Well, I’m dashed!
1 used to think my wrist was strong, but this has
got me beat!
Well, anyhow, what I can’t cut I won’t attempt to
eaf !”
And then he picked the paper up ere he went off to
biz,
And made the great discovery that hides and boots
had riz;
Straight at the cold hash baroness he made a fam-
ished leap
And snapped, “Here! give me steak next time —I see
it’s just as cheap!”
N.S.W.
THE HASH-WOLF.
TOO SLOW FOR MO.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Old Isaac Moses, went to see
The station, deep in forest rude,
Where dwells the aborigine
In soberness and solitude.
The blacks did all that blacks might do
To entertain a gentle Jew.
They threw the whirling boomerang,
They hurled the spear at distant marks,
They danced corroborees, and sang
A song suggestive of the lark’s.
They caught a ’possum by the way,
And baked it, wrapped in yellow clay.
Then Jacky Jack of Moolamin
Took too small sticks, for trifling hire,
And twirled the one the other in,
And grinned and said: “Mine make it fire.”
For long he worked the sticks about—
The stranger watched with scornful doubt.
■’« Disgust seized on the soul of Ike.
“For madches thank der Lord!” said be;
“Here sdop ,id off, ged oudt- on strike,

ARE YOU
DEAF?
If you are deaf, or going deaf, you will
be glad to hear of a simple and scientific de-
vice which will restore your hearing, no mat-
ter how old you are. There is no mystery
or secrecy about it; we describe it fully and
explain just how it acts.
You use spectacles as sight magnifiers, and
in the same way you may use this sound
magnifier as an aid to weak hearing. But,
unlike spectacles, the Wilson Common-sense
Ear-Drums are invisible and comfortable.
You can't tell you are wearing them. No
one else can, either, because they are not
seen.
They rest the ear nerves by taking the
strain off them—the strain of trying to hear
dim sounds. What a blessed relief to have
done with that tiring strain!
Being made of the purest and softest Para
rubber, they cannot be felt, even when the
head rests on a pillow. For the same reason,
a blow on the side of the head will not hurt
the ear. In fact, they protect the ear, the
tender inner parts that are so sensitive, from
cold winds, dust, sudden and piercing sounds.
So that you may clearly understand why
these facts are true, and why the Sound Mag-
nifier restores the hearing, we givq an illus-
tration of one as it lies in the ear. You will
notice that the Sound Magnifier is shaped
like a trumpet, and so conveys even the
faintest sounds right to the natural ear-
drum. Being of the softest rubber, it cannot
hurt the ear. It fits the orifice of the ear
With precision and comfort. The division
that runs across the mouth is to allow the re-
moval and insertion of the Ear-Drum, and to
brace it.
The shape of the Wilson Ear-Drum has
been chosen after years of experience as the
best adapted to carry the faintest sound right
down to the natural ear-drum.
To persons who are nearly deaf, it is not
only trying to have people shout at them,
but it hurts the ear-drmn. W.heb age comes
the ear-drum sometimes gets thickened, or
loses its tightness, and shouting does not act
properly on it. It only makes a - confused
and tiring noise. But the Sound Magnifiers
concentrate the sound in the best spot for
perfect hearing.
Of course, if you have lost the hearing-
nerve completely, or were born deaf, we can-
not pretend to cure you. Only a miracle
could do that, in spite of some of the absurd
claims made to-day. But if you can hear the
faintest sound, do not despair. You will
never regret trying the Wilson Ear-Drums.
We have letters to show you from deaf people
in Australia and New Zealand who have been
cured, and you can be cured, too. You may
wear the Ear-Drums day and night, and take
them out whenever you wish. Children can
wear them (we have special sines for children

TRAINED NURSES
PRAISE BILE BEANS
THE STANDARD FAMILY
MEDICINE.!
Next to advice direct from a physician is
that of a thoroughly qualified Nurse. Not
infrequently, indeed, based as it is on long
and careful observation of innumerable cases,
the Nurse’s advice is equally to be relied
upon. The preference of nurses of long
professional training for Bile Beans as a
medicine not only eminently preferable forj
their own private family use, but as a remedy!
singularly suited for recommendation to
their patients, serves as further proof of the
purity and efficacy of this great family
medicine.
NURSE O’REILLY,
residing at No. 1
Walker Street, Red-
fern, Sydney, says:
“Some time ago I was
prostrated with bili-
ousness, flatulency and
heartburn, and had to
keep to my room.
Bile Beans were re-
commended, so I pro-
cured a box and took
two Bile Beans at
bedtime. The effect
was really magical,
and I was soon cured.
I keep Bile Beans on
hand and recommend
them to others, and in
every instance they
give complete satisfac-
tion.”
NURSE LOMAX,
who resides at 3 Fed-
eral Street, Footscray,
Melbourne, w- rite s :
“For fully ten years
I was a great sufferer
from biliousness. Many
were the so-called
remedies I tried with-
out result. I gave
Bile Beans a trial, and
derived such benefit
from the first few
doses that I deter-
mined to undergo a
course of this splendid
medicine. Biliousness
was soon a worry of
the past, for which I
am very thankful.”
i
NURSE METCALFE,
of 32 lleydon* Street, Auckland, says:
“Myself and family have derived great
benefits from Bile Beans. For the
past five years they have been our
family medicine. Bile Beans cured
me of biliousness and indigestion,
and, as a professional nurse, I have'
recommended them to patients with
beneficial results.”
u
o
m
Bile Beans strengthen and
tone-up the system, regulate
the bowels and stimulate the
liver and stomach. Bile Beans
are a proved remedy for con-
stipation, piles, liver trouble,
bad breath, biliousness, sick-
ness, indigestion, headache,
loss of energy, anaemia, that
tired feeling, and female ail-
ments. Sold by all chemists
and stores at 1/1} and 2/9
large box, or direct from the
Bile Bean Co., 39 Pitt Street,
Sydney.

[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
A SNOW crown decks Olinda’s head.
And all Olinda’s lesser heights,
This grey June morn, are garmented
In sombre greens and cheerless whites.
Slant rain-racks from the bitter west,
A biting blizzard sweeps along—
Grey veils that hide and yet suggest
The gloomy slopes of Dandenong.
Southward, black clouds that fold and fold
Blot out the peaceful plains of Clyde,
Bridging the hills, as if to hold
The uplands from tbe world outside.
And, east, a sun-cloud aureole
Sets one great gum with gems a-glint;
But sodden grief is on the bole
Of every slender peppermint.
The blizzard passes, shrieking scorn
In thund’rous bass to stricken trees.
from the broken boughs are born
Weird moans and soughing threnodies.
Fainter, and fainter yet, they sound,
Till leaves but murmur mournfulness,
And drop great tears upon the ground
Like children voiceless with distress.
So, silence for a little space;
But with loud heralding of hail,
Wide snow clouds leave the hills and race
To whiten all the weeping vale,
And, ere the swift blast dies away.
The bending trees find voice again ;
And, in beseeching accents, pray,
Like shackled slaves, surcease from pain.
Then, dolefully, the snowflakes fall
Like apple blooms from budding fruit,
And spread white silence over all
Till ev’n the shiv’ring bush is mute;
Till, ev’n within my cosy room,
Warm with the firelight’s ruddy glow,
I feel the fingers of the gloom
Grip round my heart a chain of snow;
A chain full-linked with vague despair,
That frets me with a nameless fear,
Till sunlight swims into the air,
And noon comes noiselessly and clear.
Noon gleams and goes, the sunlight dies,
The angry west wind wakes again,
And flings against each gloomy rise
Black clouds that pour out hissing rain ;
And where the valley-track curves near
I watch the water rush along.
Till, from the snow, deep ruts appear,
Like livid weals beneath a thong;
And down, far down, the cheerless way,
I see, as some pale visionist,
A figure plodding through the grey,
Dim vagueness of the rain-made mist.
Bound through the storm-wracks towards
the west,
O’er ways that rocky are and long,
Into the veils that still suggest
The ghostly crests of Dandenong.
VICTORIA.
E. S. EMERSON.
The Jackeroo.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
HORACE GRIDDEL was a useless,
six-foot member of a wealthy family,
the paternal head of which had in-
duced McNab to take him on Mooba station
for 12 months for his tucker. McNab, a
hard-riding, sarcastic Scotchman, found him
dear at the price, and at the end of a fort-
night was planning ways and means of get-
ting rid of him without offending Griddel,
senior, who, besides being an intimate friend
of McNab’s, had an interest in Mooha. He
lost him many times on the run, but the
jackeroo always turned up smiling. Finally,
they lost him in the ranges while mustering
a distant outcamp. This time only the horse
came back, and McNab, becoming alarmed,
left old Ben and the lad Jimmy Crowe at
the camp to wait for the lost rider, while he
and the other men took the cattle home. Ben
and Jimmy at once visited a blacks’ camp in
the neighborhood, and then returned to their
depot to await results.
On the second evening, as they were pre-
paring tea, the misplaced person, stark
naked, wild-eyed and holding a clutch of
emu eggs against his chest, limped up to the
fire and grinned at them.
“Holy wars!” cried Ben, staring at the
apparition.
“Good evening, Mr. Buckle! And how are
you?” the vision inquired seriously, holding
out his hand.
“Oh, fust class !” gasped Ben, still staring.
“Are yer travellin’ or only goin’ somewhere?”
he asked.
“Ben, I have travelled to my undying sor-
row,” Mr. Griddel cried in a burst of an-
guish.
“Well, yer in one piece yet, anyway. Must
be a purty cool suit that.” Ben’s eyes were
riveted on a tabby of emu feathers, which
was the only covering that adorned the
whilom ornament of fashionable society.
That gentleman brushed it tenderly with
his hands. “There hangs a tale, Ben,” he
said. “A tale of outlawry and humiliation.”
“Sit down an’ have some tea,” said Ben.
“You look as if you want it.”
“To tell you the truth, I am nearly dead,”
the victim declared with much feeling. “It’s
been the hardest work imaginable for me to
keep myself provided for. Yesterday I cap-
tured a beastly lizard. It was a most ob-
noxious meal, I assure you. I’ve had no-
thing since. I’ve been foraging all day, and
coming along the flat I dropped on these
things. Are they the product of a fowl?”
“Why, those are emu eggs,” cried Jimmy.
splendid.”
“Are they really! Well, do you know, I
was nearly going to leave them. I’ve heard
about people looking for mare’s nests, and
when I saw them I thought I had actually
found one.”
“Well, dash my eyes!” laughed Ben.
“You’re as bad as the Irishman I heered tell
of. He was dodgin’ along a road soon after
he landed, an’ what does he pick up but a
pumpkin that some cocky had dropped. Asks
the fust cove he meets what it is, an’ the
cove tells him it’s a mare’s egg. Paddy
thought he was made, an’ lugs th’ vegetable
along for miles. Crossin’ a hill, he drops it,
an it rolls down an’ hits a log an’ busts.
Out jumps a scared wallaby from th’ other
side o’ the log, an’ pelts away like billy-o.
‘Hooroo!’ yells Paddy. ‘Th’ foal’s hatched,
an’ be jabers he’s a racer!’ ”
Mr. Griddel appeared to have no interest
apart from his evening dress. “That’s the
price of a complete rig out,” he said, stroking
it again as though half fascinated by it. “I
never thought when I came out here that I
would be forced to the extremity of dressing
like Adam.”
“Blacks?” asked Ben, while Jimmy wiped
a tear from his eye.
“Savages,” Mr. Griddel declared with em-
phasis. “My horse deserted me while I was
tied up in a network of vines, and I was
walking. Just after dusk I saw a fire, and
thought it was your camp. I walked right
in amongst them, and was surrounded in a
moment. Bai jove, I thought my days were
numbered. The men and women, and the
children and the dogs, all swarmed round me,
and 40 spoke to me at once, jabbering ex-
citedly. They examined my clothes, and felt
me, and tapped me with long sticks, and dis-
cussed me between themselves. I can swear
they were saying, as they pinched my legs
and arms, ‘Good meat here, eh?’ I hadn’t
the slightest doubt I would soon be pickled.
Then one of the women took my hat off and
put it on her head. They thought that a
great joke. They clapped their hands on
their knees, bent double and bent back, and
roared, as she strutted around with nothing
on her but my hat. It was a fatal move for
me. Every one of the wretches at once
showed a desire to emulate her. One pulled
off my coat and put it on, and the others
danced and howled with delight. Tbe trou-
sers puzzled them, and they threw me down,
and dragged me all over the premises before
they got them off. An old grey man put
them on, back to front, and when he stumped
round the fire the women rolled on the
ground and threatened to go into hysterics.
My shirt and singlet, collar and other para-
phernalia followed, and the fun increased as
each one put something on. No one put on
more than one piece, but still there were a
lot of envious people to be accommodated
yet, and I dreaded what might happen if
their jealousy led to a squabble when they
found that I wouldn’t pan out enough to go
round. I had nothing left but my boots and
socks. About a dozen examined them. Then
they motioned me to remove them, threaten-
ing to take them off with a tomahawk if I
didn’t. I complied, and they served to dress
four more of the villains.
“Having nothing to wear but a scared look
and a blush, I tried to get behind a tree.
But they intercepted me, and forming a ring
round the fire, made me parade before them.
I was awfully embarrassed. Indeed, I never
experienced such humiliation in my life.
They laughed and giggled, and passed in-
sulting remarks about me. The man with
the trousers on, and he with the coat, walked
behind me and imitated my actions and pecu-
liarities, to the , immense delight of their
audience. They were beastly rude.”
“By gosh,” said Ben, “I’d like to’ve been
behind a tree watchin’!”
“Would you really?” asked the victim,
seriously.
“Must ’ave been as good as a circus,” Ben
added.
“It was—to them. They kept it up for
half the night. Then they let me lie down
with the dogs. I crept out before morning,
and was getting nicely away when a black
bulk rose under me and shoved me into a
heap of dogs. You wouldn’t believe the com-
motion it made, I must have come peri-
lously near bursting a blood vessel in my
efforts to get away from it.” He looked
round with a haunted look in his eyes. “I
wouldn’t go through such an experience
again for five thousand pounds. It’s a
miracle I’m alive.”
“Reminds me o’ Ted Capper,” said Ben.
“Come home purty late one night, half
sprung, as usual. The door of his hut was
open, an’ as he steps in he stumbles agin
something big an’ hairy. It sed ‘hee-haw’
tremenjous loud an’ sudden, an’ as Ted
sprawls out it bumps him in the stummick
an’ purty nigh knocks the roof off with him.
’Fore he ken drop back, a pesky old rooster
makes a spring off o’ some tin cans he was
roostin’ on, an’ hits him ag’in, with the darn-
dest clatter yer ever heard. Soon’s Ted got
his feet he cut for Kelly’s pub like a barrel
down a hill. He was purty wopsy for a
week after, an’ he wouldn’t sleep in that hut
ag’in for a trifle. They told him ’twas only
Bland’s donkey what ’ud fetched him one in
the bread basket. But Ted couldn’t swaller
that yarn—not by a long sight. He punched
that donkey, though, one day when it smelt
at him through the fence. ’Twarn’t because
he believed the critter ’ad anything to do
with it, but he jes’ punched him on genrel
principles. ”
Ben laughed when he finished, but every-
body else looked serious.
“Don’t see the point,” said Jimmy. “The
yarn isn’t apropos."
“I tell yer it’s a positive fact,” said Ben
in a loud voice. “I knew Ted Capper well,
an’ yer ken see Bland’s donkey any time yer
go down there.”
“But what’s Ted Capper and Bland’s don-
key and somebody else’s rooster got to do
with this affair of Mr. Griddel’s?”
“Yer as dense as a log o’ wood,” said Ben.
“Didn’ he get a rippin’ snorter of a fright—
same as Capper did? Pelted off ’ammer an’
tongs from nuthin’ more’n would hurt him ’n
his own shadder”
He shut up like an oyster as Jimmy dug
his elbow into his ribs. But Mr. Griddel
didn’t appear to notice the slip. He was
brooding over his wrongs.
“What happened next?” asked Jimmy.
“Well,” said Mr. Griddel, “when I thought
I was clear of those cannibals, I began to
look about me for something to eat. I was
starving. Before long I saw an emu standing
behind a tree. I was the most patient and
painstaking man in the world as I crawled
towards that bird. It took me nearly an
hour. When I rose to my feet at the tree I
could hear my heart beating, and I scarcely
dared to breathe for fear I would scare it.
I reached down carefully, and made a sudden
grab at its leg. I caught it. too, but it
caught me almost as quickly. Bai jove, that
fowl could kick like a mule. It struck me

DO YOU FEEL LIKE GIVING UP?
Does your back ache constantly ? Do you feel dull, miserable
and tired all the time ? Do you wonder why ordinary daily duties
wear you out ? Do you have ** blue days and restless nights ?
Kidney sickness silently plays out the strongest person. A
dull, draggy ache in the small of the back will tell on the healthiest
man or woman. And if the kidneys fail in their task of filtering
uric acid poisons from the blood, it leads to painful attacks of
neuralgia, rheumatism, sciatica, gravel, headaches -to worrying
attacks of dizziness, nervousness, heart palpitation, scanty,
painful and too frequent urination, .
Don’t neglect weak kidneys. There is danger of running
gradually into dropsy, Bright’s Disease or diabetes. At the first sign
of backache or disorders of the urine, use Doan s Backache Kidney
Pills. A remedy that has cured your neighbors will cure you.

perience nearly broke my heart. It seemed
such a hopeless quest to be hunting for food
in the bush, with nothing but my bare hands.
“However, I flushed a lizard eventually on
the side of a hill, and that creature could
run, too. I pursued it desperately. I chased
it round bushes and rocks, and down the hill,
and when I got close to it I made a grab at
its tail, and was dragged about ten feet
along the ground on my chest. But I helu
the lizard, and that’s the only food I had. I
am so glad to be with you again; it is
almost like returning home.”
Ben was gazing moodily into the fire,
shaking his head at intervals.
“It’s a nice cup of tea the boss has poured
out for you an’ me,” he said at length.
“What’s that?”
“He’s set his mind on it, too,” continued
Ben, more dolefully than before.
“On what?”
“You an’ me are goin’ out there to build a
hut. Then we’ve got to live in it to look
after that part of the run. It’ll be lively
work. One of us will always have to stop at
th’ hut while the other rides about, an’ one
can’t do much ag’in a host.” He shook his
head again. “Darned if I like the thoughts
of it meself, but, of course, orders must be
obeyed.” , . ,
“Oh, must they!” said Mr. Griddel with
sudden briskness. “I’ll have a say in that
matter.”
He had his say without loss of time; and
three days later he was on his way to more
civilised parts. And he had barely crossed
the horizon when three blackfellows, in bor-
rowed plumes, called at the station for
rations and tobacco —as per contract.
EDWARD S. SORENSON.
Of Foods and Standpoints.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
I have no antipathy, or rather idiosyncracy in
diet, humor, air, anything. I wonder not at the
French for their dishes of frogs, snails and toad-
stools, nor at the Jews for locusts and grasshoppers;
but, being among them, make them my common
viands, and I find they agree with my stomach as
well as theirs. I could digest a salad gathered in
a churchyard as well as in a garden. _ I cannot
start at the presence of a serpent, scorpion, lizard,
or salamander. At the sight of a toad or viper I find
in me no desire to take up a stone to destroy them.
—Sir Thomas Browne.
IT is a clear, strong voice that comes
across the centuries to a man, and I
find much comfort and justification in
it. Since I came to years of discretion, I
have ceased to regard as vices in my neigh-
bor what are merely habits in myself. A
man may be an excellent fellow, and still
have no stomach for side-dishes; and when
any man whose tastes or gods or hobbies I
take leave to dislike forthwith derides me as
a criminal, I am sensibly annoyed. As an
amiable anarchist, I still like to get what
I give, and 20 years of disappointment have
not availed altogether to dishearten me. I
can extend a brotherly tolerance to the good
folk of Dunedin, although their city suffo-
cates me; and I persist in my characteristic
attitude in Wellington, where hospitality is
disparaged as extravagance. So long as I
can enjoy my food, I will never* meanly be-
grudge another man his poison.
One day in Singapore I took dinner with
a Frenchman. He was a good fellow with
a clear eye, and though I was a stupid colt
enough I had the sense to love him. I com-
plimented him especially on one of the
ragouts. He bowed his gratification, and
mentioned that the meat was iguana. I
went out on a sudden excuse, and was ill.
Then I returned, and conscientiously had
some more iguana- From that meal I date
my cultivated taste in foods. In this mat-
ter every man is his own master, but every
taste deserves investigation. Our beloved
mushrooms tney throw into the Tiber at
Rome as poisonous growths; and the ex-
quisite French champignons are abhorred as
deadly toadstools by English hinds. I love
to make money in this easy way, and, if I
dared, I would devote a thousand words to
an eulogium of fungus. It is the most suc-
culent and surprising of all nerve-restoring
foods, the most exotic and alluring of all
vegetable relishes. Years ago in Sydney, my
brother and I were wont to go afield in the
dewy mornings, and in lumpy pastures and
bushy dells in the tract of broken land that
stretches from Canterbury on towards Croy-
don we would collect fungi of sorts.
Some were bright yellow, and some pleasing
crimson; some large and confident, some deli-
cate and small. Some had a peppery taste
when cooked, and some gave a hint of
cloves. We ate them earnestly, bent on our
experiment, and although our skill at detect-
ing dangerous sorts was elementary at best,
we suffered no harm, but kept on experi-
menting with a heightened appetite. Why
use Force when you can get fungus?
Why . But I digress.
And so I live in hope of some day tasting
the gohanna of Australia. It differs in ap-
pearance from the iguana of Malaya, which
is a rather fearful dragon as to his looks;
but I see no reason why it should not be as
toothsome cooked. My knowledge of nat-
ural history in this matter is largely of
the imagination; but for what it is worth I
give it unto you. The iguana is a placable
and harmonious beast. It sways gently in the
breeze on high treetops, with its quiet, lumin-
ous eyes roving in search of prey. When it
spies a chicken or a snail in the middle dis-
tance, it descends rapidly and makes a
thankful meal. Its digestive power is mar-
vellously catholic. It is (I believe) the
only living creature that will grow fat on
mining-scrip and globe-trotters. When a
python pursues it to its leafy fastnesses, it
winks and flies away. I had no faith in
the tales I heard of flying lizards till one
misjudged his distance and hit me full in the
eye when I was walking home from office
one afternoon in Singapore. My Malay
sais fixed up a poultiee for me, and the
poultice brought the inflammation to such a
head that my eye bulged up and bent over
till I could see down the back of my neck.
But I recovered, and this is beside the sub-
ject. I was about to say that it is safe to
make trial of anything that seems possible
eating, because no man ever knows what
day he may miss a remittance. It is the
same with beverages. Even in Christian
Australia, it is possible to die of thirst; I
nearly died of thirst once myself m Mel-
bourne. So long as it is possible for a man
to die of thirst, a man must not be fas-
tidious in his drinks. When I was in Banki-
pur with the Opium Commission, I had a
drink of khoumis. Indeed, my fellow scribe
and I had several drinks ; about a goatskin
altogether- Klioumis is not a nice drink for
several reasons, among others because it is
bottled (so to speak) while the goatskins are
still green; but it is a prophylactic against
pneumonia, and we noticed that in Banki-
pur the nights were invariably moist. It
is thick and grey, and you drink it through
your closed teeth to keep the shreds out. The
next morning you stick your head in ice till
it is sufficiently reduced in size to allow you
to get on to the verandah. Then, it any
man comes along and mentions mares’-milk,
you kill him with an axe. I believe that
milk is also imbibed by infants and invalids
in its natural or unfortified condition ; but
I never vouch for a fact of which I have no
personal knowledge. It is also recorded
that in the days of the Inquisition alleged
heretics were occasionally compelled to drink
water. But we will not dwell on such hor-
rors. ...
Part of the charm of life in Asia consists
in the fact that you can get anything to eat
you want, whether you feel that you want
it or not. The one thing that is the su-
preme recompense for all your perils and dis-
illusionments is the Durian. It is such a
king of fruits that by comparison with it
the strawberry is a Servile scullion and the
peach a shameless fraud. Linschott wrote
of it in 1599: “It is of such an excellent
taste that it surpasses in flavor all the fruits
of the world, according to those who have
tasted it.” Says Paludanus: “This fruit is
of a! hot and humid nature. To those not
used to it, it seems at first to smell like
rotten onions, but immediately they have
tasted it they prefer it to all other food.
The natives give it honorable titles, exalt it,
and make verses on it.” And Alfred Russel
Wallace testifies: “A rich, butter-like cus-
tard flavored with almonds gives the best
general idea of it, but intermingled with it
come wafts of flavor that call to mind cream-
cheese, onion-sauce, brown sherry and other
incongruities- Then there is a rich, gluti-
nous smoothness in the pulp which nothing
else possesses, but which adds to its deli-
cacy. It is neither acid, nor sweet, nor
juicy, yet one feels the want of none of
these qualities, for it is perfect as it is. It
produces no nausea or other bad effect, and
the more you eat of it the less you feel
inclined to stop. In fact, to eat Durians is
a new sensation, worth a voyage to Asia to
experience.” I should think so. If ever
I have the luck to go to Singapore again,
the chief inducement will he that I want to
eat the Durian some more. It is the only fruit
I know that has a positive personality, and
one writes of it naturally with a capital
letter. It is a supreme excuse and an in-
comparable new religion. A wise man never
tells his religion; but if you want to know
mine its name is Durian.

A Bicycle Tragedy,
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Now that horses are becoming obsolete one wonders-
how future novelists will manage without them.
The riderless steed, rushing home with saddle awry
and stirrups thumping against his side, telling with-
out speech a dreadful story of the death of his-
master, used to be one of the most effective pro-
perties” of the romance writer. But the gallant-
horse whose praises have been sung in epic and lay
and ballad since the days when the coursers ot
Diomed carried him to battle against Troy appears to-
have had his day. If Adam Lindsay Gordon were
alive at the present time he would probably curse
the bicycle in a foaming ballad. As it is, the poets,
such as they are, of the present day must accept the
inevitable, and do the best they can with it. Here
is a lead for them
HE rode away at break of day—
Or thereabouts—his style
Was confident and proud and gay r.
So also was his smile.
She stood upon the balcony _
And, as he passed from view,
She kissed her hand and sighed, Ah me.
Adieu, sweetheart, adieu.
“He said he would return at noon
He goes to buy the ring !
My ring! O Cupid, send him soon.
My hero and my king .
Noon came, but he came not; she smiled
And said : “It’s hard to choose:
I hope he will not be beguiled
Those jewellers are Jews.
The hours passed by and brought no
change,
She sadly shook her head.
Like Mariana of the Grange,
“He cometh not!” she said.
But oh, what spectacle is this?—
His steed—alone and tree—
Comes plunging, as down an abyss
A stream zigzagedly
Shoots wildly, so down that rough road
It shot —the road was steep—
And just bv Edith May’s abode
Fell in a shudd’ring heap.
It stood as though alive it were—
Alas, in death it slept.
Then Edith May let down her hair,
Took off her boots —and wept!
“He’s dead, my lover and my king—
I know that he is dead!
I nevermore for anything
In life will care,” she said.
Forth with a lantern did they go
To find his corpse somewhere.
They did not find his corpse—Ah no.
He had no corpse to spare.
She found him —but so much unlike!
Oblivious of her charms !
He’d been projected from his bike
Outside the “Cycling Arms.
She stands upon her balcony,
You’ll see her any day.
A-pelting stones at cyclists free
Alas, fair Edith May!

“A note of striking unanimity was sounded by all cyanide experts in their annual reviews for

they hailed it as the best machine for agitating ore pulp in cyanide solution, and accorded its
