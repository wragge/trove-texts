SATURDAY, JULY 5, 1884.
The new Anglican Bishop has lost no time
in commencing operations against the prin-
ciples of our Public Instruction Act. That
he should be moved by a spirit of antagonism
to that Act is no more than might have been
expected. The policy of his sect has, from
the first inception ef the system, been
adverse to it Dr. Barry’s predecessor op-
posed the movement for unsectarian public
education with consistent hostility. The
really surprising thing is the alliances which
Dr. Babhy finds himself able to enter into
Dr. Barker was under the necessity of
working in effectual, although tacit, fellow-
ship with the Roman Catholic hierarchy.
His keenest adversaries were the very per-
sons who are now hand in glove with Dr.
Barry In the endeavour to destroy the
structure they themselves helped to build
up. It is quite entertaining to observe the
personnel of the Bishop’s “tail” on the
occasion of his presenting himself at the
Education Department to open his first
approaches against the Act. The spectacle
of a posse of Dissenting parsons backing up
an Episcopal Bishop in what was, in reality,
simply an attack upon “non-conformity ’>
of present-day pattern, was even grotesque-
Mr. Jefferis, the Pope of the Sydney Con-
gregation sts, seems to have recognised the
satire of the situation, and finessed by com-
ing late, in lieu of swelling the Bishop’s
retinue. But Mr. Jefferis’ presence, under
any circumstances, illustrated the extra-
ordinary nature of the situation. He ba s
frankly confessed that he now thinks he
blundered when he zealously worked for the
principles of the Education Act. We pre-
sume that the other “Dissenters” who took
part in the deputation have made a similar
discovery.
* • •
We will endeavour to analyse the situa-
tion. It is more than two years since we
pointed out that the “Evangelical” Pro-
testants—as the Anglican “low churchmen”
and the Dissenters from the Church of E>"g.
land style themselves—had, in the heat of
what was really on their part a crusade
against the Church of Rome and the high
ecclesiastical section of the Church of Eug-
laud, over-reached themselves, and that, in
their eagerness to disable the Papists from
indoctrinating their children with their
hereditary faith, they bad played the game
of the Secularists, aud dealt a fatal blow to
all dogmatic teaching. There is no room for
mistaking, now that time has exposed the
results of the exertions then made, and tl e
true intentions of tome of the most active
agents. The moment that the schools of the
sects were superseded, the children of the
State escaped from the influence of the par-
sons. These functionaries had been skilfully
led by the nose. Sir Hhnky Pahkes— the
Protestant Hero—found it, shortly after the
passing of the Act by his Government under
the impulse of the Education League, con.
venlent to claim all the credit due to any-
body for the Act. He will, when he returns
to the colony, probably be glad to forget
that he ever advanced such a claim ; and we
are perfectly willing that he should quote
The Bueeetin of the time, in which his
claim was derided as an impudent imposi-
tion, and the true father of the League was
asserted to have been the Rev. Mr. Green-
wood.
• ■ •
How, Mr. Greenwood was indubitably
strongly influenced all the time by the
principles which he not long after adopted
in their entirety — the principles of Free-
thought; and the line in which he directed
his operations, and in which he was fol-
lowed with blind docility by Mr. Jefferis
and all the non-conformist professional
theologians, secured for the movement the
support of that powerful, slthough unorgan-
ized contingent, the Secularists. Had the
drift of the proposed legislation been in the
direction simply of securing for one group
of sects a triumph over another group of
sects, the Secularists would, in all likelihood'
have thrown their weight against the aggres-
sors, on the principle their attack was
equivalent to an interference with equal
liberty of conscience. But when the League
declared—and acted on the declaration—that
the sects which co-operated with it were
willing to abandon dogmatic teaching alto-
gether as a part of the curriculum of the
State schools, and so leave all sects upon an
equal footing, nothing seemed fairer, and
the thing was carried with a swing and a
rush. We remember the programme very
well, and Mr. Jefferis has been honest
enough to confess in effect that he too re-
members it, and admits that his present
attitude is one of repudiation. It will,
therefore, be vain for the rest of the agita-
tors of to-day to pretend—as the Bishoji
speaking for them pretended—that their de-
mands are not inconsistent with their
former desires, and with the spirit which in
the byegone time they helped to impress
upon the Public Instruction Act, This was
the programme:—That the State had nothing
to do with the religion of its members.
That it was concerned to secure a proper
development of intelligence in secular
affairs, and that there its functions pro-
perly ended. That lu its schools unsec- i
tarian teaching should alone be imparted,
and that each sect should be equally at
liberty and should be afforded equal oppor-
tunity to gather togethtr the children of its
members, and to indoctrinate them with
whatever amount of dogma was considered
requisite The famous clause 7, which pro-
vides that there shall be “general religious
instruction” in the schools was no part of
the actual system. It was simply an ex-
pression thrown in to turn the edge of the
thrusts which were made at tfieplan by its
critics as “ godless and immoral.”
• a •
This is made very apparent by the absence
of any definition as to what constitutes
“general religion.” There was, indeed, a
good deal of palaver about “ Common Chris-
tianity,” but clearly that was not the inten-
tion of such supporters of the Act as Mr.
James Greenwood and the school of
thinkers which supported him. The Rev. Dr.
Barry ahd his followers now desiro to foist
an interpretation of their own into the Act,
and that interpretation would, if admitted,
simply make the Instruction Act do the
precise thing which, prior to its enactment,
all its supporters persistently, solemnly, and
vehemently declared they did not desire.
That is to say, it would convert the Public
Schools iuto seminaries of one combination
of sects. The pupils turned out by the
Public Schools would be, if no parson or
priest meddled with them, just an inferior
sort of Protestant. They would be taught
to believe in miracles, and in the Divinity of
Christ, but they would have learned no-
thing whatever to induce them to regard
the Episcopal tradition, or to respect the
Virgin Mary or Father O’Flannaoan. In
short, every Public School pupil would be
dogmatically indoctrinated to the stage
which would fit them for the ministrations
of the Pitt-stroet Congregational Church, or
any other little Bethel. Mr. Jefferis and
his mates would not need to wag a finger. If
Bishop Barry and his clergy, and Arch-
bishop Moran and his clergy, would only
equally refrain from any exertion to add to
the school curriculum of “general religious
teaching,” and if the Churches of which
th se Prelates are the heads in the colony
would just discontinue their present exer-
tions and sacrifices, and, abolishing their
own schools, permit their children to pass
through the State schools, there would wot
be a native-born Anglican or Roman Catholic
in New South Wales in another generation,
except such as had been specially attended
to in the matter of dogmatic teaching by
their parents.
• • •
There is no honest escape from the recog-
nised fact that the very clergy who are to-day
clamouring for religious instruction in the
ordinary school course, represented, when
agitating for the Bill, that they knew nothing
of the kind would bo either possible or fail»
aud undertook to equalise everything, and
to fulfil all requirements, by themselves
arranging independently for special religious
instruction of their special lambs. The fact
is that they have neglected the duties they
promised to discharge, and are now endeav,
curing to cloak their own practical exhibi-
tion of laziness, meanness, or indifference by
raising a fresh tumult of sound, beating the
drum-ecclesiastic, and posturing in public
deputations. And all to what end? To
shift off the»rown shoulders the burden they
had volunteered to bear, while promising
alresh—but with cautious vagueness—that
they will arrange, this time, for special reli-
gious instruction, by their own agents. They
ask the public to believe that although while
the “general religious instruction” in
the schools was minimised to a degree
which has excited their present grave
anxieties and aroused them to their pre-
sent attitude, they did nothing to pro-
vide the supplement of “ special religious
instruction,” they will become active m
that respect after succeeding in converting
the “general religious instruction” iuto a
very fairly effectual equivalent for the
“special religious instruction” they Dad failed
to supply! This is surely too large a draft
upon the credulity of the laity. For our
own part, we don’t attach the slightest
credit to these promises for the future. If
thedeputationists could succeed in their
present aim of converting the State schools
into proselytising institutions, they will bo
under no necessity of arranging for indepen-
dent special dogmatic instruction. It is
ridiculous for them to expect people to be-
lieve that they will make, when there is no
necessity, the exertions aud the sacrifices
which they failed to make when there was,
according to their own showing, a very
urgent necessity.
* * *
The requests urged by Bishop Barry and
his retinue were not only repudiatory and
sectarian in their very essence, but they are
—happily, we think—impracticable, or, at
least, so glaringly inconsistent with the pro-
fessions of the deputationists, that the public
is almost certain to detect the absurdity,
and laugh the whole business off the stage
of serious public affairs. Bishop Barky in
the name of the deputation, demanded that
in the examination of pupils “due import-
ance should be given to Scriptural know-
ledge.” Further, that the teachers should be,
whether they were Protestants, or Roman
Catholics, or Secularists, be subjected toatest
as to their competence to “intelligently im-
part Scripture lessons!” And, in addition,
lie demanded that- the school exercises should

Mr. Dymock, bookseller, of Pitt-street, has
published a set of five coloured prints, represent-
ing Sydney as it appeared at the commencement
of the century. Those prints are well done, and
quite interesting. Their price is one guinea the
set, and they are worth the money.
Bishop Hale, of Brisbane, proposes to
retire from the Bishop business in March next,
when he will have attained the 73rd year, and the
37th of his espiscopate. About teu in Brisbane, we
believe; previously in Perth, W.A. Bishop Hale
is a worthy man, and has worked hard. He is a
lineal descendant of Sir Mathew Hale, whose nau.e
he bears, even to thetraditional one “t” in Mathew.
Mr. Critchett Walker, chief under-clerk
to the Colonial Secretary, has just issued a neat
pamphlet and map descriptive of New South
Wales, its climate, productions, soil, resources,
population, progress, wealth, and a thousand and
one other things that every immigrant wants to
know and generally has to wade through three or
four exhaustive volumes to And out. To the
immigrant, this pamphlet will prove invaluable,
for it contains in concise form just the very points
he needs to guide him in the selection of a farm or
a place in which to live. A perusal of the publica-
tion has taught us more about New South Wales,
its progress and resources, than we ever knew be-
fore, and we have already got our eye on a fe«r big
run that we mean to squat on, one at a time, of
course, just as soon as we can get around to it.
daily be opened by a prayer and a hymn.
Mr. Jeffhris supplemented Dr. Barry’s
propositions by an explanation necessitated
by an objection raised by tho Minister for
Education. Mr. Jefferis did not think the
deputation asked that any teacher’s religious
belief should be inquired into. Only that
the facts and statements contained in the
Scripture lessons should bo known to him
before he entered upon the work of instruc-
tion.
* ♦ *
It is difficult to believe that these are seri-
ous propositions, emanating jointly from a
Prelate of the Church of England, and Min-
isters of Noncomformist bodies. Here we
have the Prelate actually proposing what is
equivalent to a Test Act for a body of Civil
servants and representative Dissenters
backing him up. Surely the Dissenters of
to-day must be badly acquainted with their
own ecclesiastical history. But the Bishop
and his abettors would probably deny that
his proposed institution of a test would be
equivalent to a Test Act, inasmuch as he
does not propose that there should be any
profession of faith or any disability for infi-
delity. All that would be required—he may
plead—is that the teachers should prove
their acquaintance with the theories they
Would be called in to teach. Presuming
that agreement with those theories or dog-
mas were not exacted, how, in the name of
goodness, could an examination of teachers
be conducted ? Or how could it be expected
that—as the deputationists require—teachers
should not only recite the Scripture les-
sons, but explain them, if they did
not believe in them ? When “ tested ” —the
expression is Dr. Barry’s —the teachers
would, of course, have to travel outside the
record —that is to say, to show that they
“intelligently” comprehended the signifi-
cance of the lessons. They would have to
explain how this or that passage struck
them. Who, then, would be adjudged to
have exhibited most intelligence in Biblical
criticism if desirous of entering upon the
duties of a Public School teacher —the Rev.
Mr. Spicer, for example, or Mr. Charles
Bright, or Dean Mahony ? The thing is
preposterous, and would close the teaching
regards State schools, against
all but dogmatists of one complexion. Again,
if, in the examinations of pupils, due import-
ance were to be attached to Scriptural
knowledge—which means that more marks
than at present allowed should be awarded
to pupils proficient in that department—all
children whose parents object to their par-
ticipating in that teaching would be placed
at a disadvantage in comparison of results
as against the other children. And this is
not a trifling objection, for Mr. Trickett
told the deputationists that, “ as a matter
of fact, when those Scripture lessons were
read in the Public Schools, large numbers of
children retired.”
• • •
And, moreover, there are scholarships and
other advantages, which may be won by
competition in examinations. For all such
rewards of exertion and intelligence, the
pupils who did not attend Scripture lessons
would be, if not absolutely disqualified, at
least heavily handicapped. Of two aspir-
ants, supposing one to be superior in secular
knowledge to the extent of, say, 80 marks
out of a possible 100, the other gaining 90
marks for Scriptural lessons which the other
had not been permitted by his parents, for
conscientious reasons, to attend, would
snatch the prize from him! We do not ex-
pect that the public of New South Wales
will tolerate any such subversion of the
present Act as the Bishop and his helpers
desire, or will permit them to disseminate as
they propose, in the secular schools of the
State, the seeds of sectarian strife and ani-
mosity, which it was hoped the Act would
serve to allay.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Insurance.
T«e case of Hordern against the Commer-
cial Union Insurance Company should induce
business people—especially such as are insured in
the defendant company-to overhaul their policies
forthwith, and satisfy themselves that what they
believe those policies to express is duly expressed,
and in a fashion that will not admit of two Inter-
pretations. In the particular case referred to, by
careless wording alike of proposals and of policies,
the plaintiffs, Messrs. Anthony and Samuel, Hor-
dern, of the Haymarket, have been exposed to
extreme annoyance; and had they not been in a
position to fight for a principle and for their repu-
tation, without considering expense, they must
probably have submitted to endure the entire loss
of goods destroyed by fire in premises which they
had been for years paying premiums to protect.
The case was exceedingly entangled by defective
descriptions, and by change in the numbering of
premises by the Corporation. But the main
features were perfectly clear. The plaintiffs in-
tended to insure the premises where the
fire reached with the defendant company,
and believed they were so insured. - It is
almost equally clear that the defendant com-
pany believed also that the plaintiffs were
fully insured with them. They were push-
ing business, as is customary with Insurance
companies, and the plaintiffs were, like Barkis,
“ willin’.” If either party had believed that there
was aught remaining uninsured, there would have
been a fresh policy directly. There was no pre-
tence that plaintiffs bad not been paying premiums
adequate to the amount they claimed when the
Are occurred. And as to the plea of the conceal-
ment of Barlow’s tenancy, that was flagrantly
absurd, considering that Barlow’s shop fronted
the main street of tho metropolis, under the plain-
tiffs’ first floor, and that the insurance company’s
representative had been over all the Horderns’
premises. If insurance companies were all to ex-
hibit a readiness to look for quibbling points In
policies whenever a fl r e occurs, and to charge re-
spectable insurers with concealment of circum-
stances obvious to every wayfarer, insurance
business would soon come to an end. It is right
to scrutinise every detail where incendiarism or
intentional misrepresentation may bo presumed.
But to deny compensation to a straightforward
'customer, because what had all along been mu-
tually regarded as the existing contract, and had
been paid for as such, admits on scrutiny of
technical cavil. Is surely the most perverse
policy ever adopted by aa Institution which de-
pends for business upon the diffusion of an im-
pression that it would not condescend to profit
by an accident, when its very business Is to
protect its customers from the ill consequences of
accidents.
The National Conscience.
It is intensely cheering to observe that
wholesome principles of national morality are
now and again Inculcated upon and accepted by
the working-men of Great Britain. As a matter
of fact, such principles are advocated with con-
stancy and courage by several of the most influ-
ential and widely circulated of the journals which
address themselves particularly to the working
class. In view of the steady gravitation of political
power towards the actual people of Great Britain,
as distinguished from the aristocratic and pluto-
cratic orders and those middle classes which follow
in a servile fashion every whim of their social
superiors, the views advocated by these journals
are of a significance in many respects superior to
the teachings of the Times itself, and of the other
great dailies which minister to the section of Eng-
lishmen wh« at present control the affairs of the
nation. These show only what are the ideas which
find acceptance at the hands of the present politi-
cal rulers of Great Britain. By reading the organs
of th® masses, one ascertains what are the prin-
ciples which re recognised by the people who
will undoubtedly ere long wield the prevailing
power, and govern the national councils. By study
of the great dailies, one learns what is. By
perusing the cheap weeklies which have enor-
mous circulation—far transcending that of all
the famous dailies combined—one is enabled to
comprehend what will be. Besides these im-
mensely influential weekly papers, however, the
working classes have from time to time other
special teachings. And these are so uni-
form in their tendency that there is no
room to doubt that their drift is accept-
able to and approved of, by the class to which they
are addressed. No reader of The Bulletin need
be at a loss to comprehend what that drift is. We
find it invariably in complete accordance with the
ideas which prompt our own utterances. As an
example, we may quote the following epitome of a
fre® lecture delivered at the Working Men’s Col-
lege, Great Ormond-street, London, by Mr. New-
comen Groves, M.A., on “ Egypt: A few Personal
Recollections.” In giving an interesting account
of the ancient history of E?ypt, Mr. Groves said
that “ the inhabitants of Alexandria had suffered
more cruelty than the inhabitants of any other
city in the world, not excepting Jerusalem, but he
did not think that the English nation could say
much about this, for, in his opinion, one of the
foulest blots that ever rested upon English history
was the way in which England bombarded that
city two years ago. Mr. Groves enumerated
various acts of injustice to which the fellaheen
were subjected. The Pachas and the Khedive had
the power of making them work without pay, and
such a thing as justice was, and Is, unknown.
Arabi’s demands werre just and right, and the army
revolted because it was the only organised party.
What really interfered with English justice to
Egypt was that our eyes had been blinded by these
cursed—he used the word advisoably— Canal shares,
and the interests of the bondholders.” We need
scarcely expatiate on these remarks. Our readers
will immediately perceive that they are identical
with the opinions which from the outset of the
Egyptian trouble. The Bulletin, alone, among
the newspapers of Australia, has uniformly ex-
pressed.
The Hatter of Fuller.
There is certainly a singular amount of indiscre-
tion among our daily journalists. The Evening
News and the Dally Telegraph each commented
with severity upon the tardy admission of Fuller
that he might, after all, have signed the bond
upon which he was being sued. Mr. Fuller is
held up to execration as a villain, who only failed
to cause an innocent man to be held guilty of for-
gery because he had not courage sufficient to
stand to the amount of perjury requisite to the
accomplishment of his execrable design. Of
couise the journals mentioned did but re-echo the
tone of comments adopted by Sir George Innes,
the Judge who presided at the trial. But what
more terrible confession of weakness could there
be than a disposition to adopt, without reflection,
the ideas of Sir George Innes ? That the Judge
was moved by an honest cannot be
doubted. That he gave clear and prompt expres-
sion to his indignation and his meaning is entirely
creditable to his heart as and his sense
of duty as a Judge.' But how stands the
case as to his judgment, and that of those
who echoed his remarks. The nature of the case
was such that the oath of one man was pitted
against the oath of another. M‘Kay’8 word was
against Fuller’s. The.bank official and the cus-
tomer had not even equal reason for perjury, if so
inclined. Mr. M'Kay’s whole career, as a bank
official, his reputation and integrity, all hinged
upon his success in proving that the bond was
bona fide. If not signed by Fuller, it must have
been signed by Mm. His verv existence hinged
upon demonstrating that Fuller had really signed
it. With respect to Fuller, it was not a question
of life and honour; it was simply a question of
£624. It was possible that Fuller had forgotten
having signed. It was impossible that M'Kay
could have fo/got having forged. The alternative
was a frightful one for both parties. If Fuller
persisted, MKay was a lost man. If Fuller re-
treated or winced at the awful responsibility de-
pending upon the trustworthiness of his memory,
he exposed himself—first to an apparent loss of
over £600, and, secondly, to suspicions just as
frightful as those from which his retrogression
would relieve M’Kay. We prefer to believe that
Fuller had really signed the bond, and had really
forgotten the circumstance so entirely as to re-
gard the claim as an imposture when pre-
sented. We prefer to believe that In lieu
of being the blackguard the Judge made
him out to be, and the dailies indicated—
that in lieu of being, In short, a scoundrel and a
poltroon, he may be a conscientious and courage-
ous man. We reason that there was more courage
required to confess a doubt after the case had
gone so far, than would have been requisite to let
matters proceed. There is no question that almost
everyone who road the evidence as this case pro-
ceeded, regarded M‘Kay as guilty. The corrobora-
tive character of the accessory circumstances was
fearfully against him. His confessed indiscretions
seemed to lead .naturally up to the point alleged.
And now, consider. Had Mr. Fuller persevered
in his conviction that he did not sign, he would
most probably have obtained a verdict. Whether
he did or not, he would certainly have escaped the
the vituperation of th® Journals. Had he been
a hardened villain, he would have stood
under the aegis of the law, sheltered and pro-
tected by that magnificent ruling of Sir James
Martin that naught may with Impunity be
cast in the face of a scoundrel, save facts that
can be proved to the hilt in a court-of-law sense.
As a scoundrel, Fuller would apparently have
been safe on all sides, except the side of his con-
science. As a man, frankly confessing that he
might have been mistaken In his recollection of
events, he exposed himself to be scourged and
derided by every blockhead that wears a wig or
wields a pen. The first time a man of deficient
conscience or pluck finds himself confronted with
such a dilemma as that which Mr. Fuller had to
face, he will, no doubt, bear in mind the lesson
rubbed in by Judge Innes and the dailies, and
swear straight ahead to the bitter end.
England, yearning to free herself from the tram-
mels of a faineant , mischievous aristocracy, owes
a deep debt of gratitude to Lord St. Leonards
Some noble lords have, by a certain splendour in
their very vices, fascinated the groundlings whom
oa. Others, by the stately hauteur
of their vanity, have dazzled, if not awed, even
more than they have offended, “the general.’’.For
great robbers of the commons, there has been not
unoften a savour of admiration in the very hatred
with which they were regarded. When, however
tho baron condescends to low blackguardism—to
the filthy tricks of the pot-house bully; or the
duke takes to emulating the brutality of a Bill
Sykes, he excites a disgust unrelieved by one
scintilli of sympathy, and causes even dullards to
see that the hereditary principle of nobility, by
conferring great privileges and legislative powers
on the criminal, the lustful, the idiotic, or the mad
successor to a perhaps originally well-earned
honour (perhaps also not), is a blasphemous insult
to Humanity.

Sm Alfred Stephen contends that no represen-
tation tending to show the Innocence of a prisoner
charged with a capital crime should, on any ac-
count, be made to the newspapers: it should be
made to the proper quarter. Sir Alfred doesn’t
condescend to give any why for t:iis surprising
dogma. Ordinary folks would imagine that, if
there were any doubt of the guilt of a prisoner
under sentence of death, the greater the publicity
given to a fpublication of the doubt, the greater
the probability of securing the information neces-
sary to dispel it. Representation to the “ proper
quarter,” as the ex-C.J. euphuistically puts it, are
too often met with the official snub direct. More-
over, the “ proper quarter,” in nine cases out of
ten, is the very authority whose action is under
review by tho public; hence, to confine making
representations to the ” proper quarter,” is to pre-
sume that the “proper quarter” possesses the
desire to prove itself in the wrong—a presumption
which the experience of ages by no means war-
rants. In the majority of instances, it is only by
making representations to the horrid newspapers
that sufficient pressure can be brought to bear
upon the “proper quarter" to induce that very
conservative entity to “ go about.”

Here you are:—“ Collins and Vernon’s ‘Fun Com-

Irish Comedian. A lady pianist completes the
company.” What will surprise you, thougR, will
be to learn that this “correct news,” is from Col-
lins and Vernon themselves. This will dispel at
once, and for ever, all doubts as to the genuine-
ness of the intelligence. We have seen tRe Collins’s

in St. Louis. This doesn’t surprise us a bit. We
knew John couldn’t last forever! We have met
(such was our good fortune) Mr. Fulton in nearly
every city in Australasia, and he has always been
“ on the fake,” Once he billed Adelaide like a
circus, and chartering D. C. F. Moodie to lecture,
and subsidising an old German and a magic-
lantern, set forth that he would produce a “ grand
diorama of the Zulu war,” and f urther announced
that the affair would “coruscate with beauty,”
and that “ competition was paralysed.” The first
reminds us of “A Midsummer Night’s Dream.”

the feelings of the audience expressed themselves
in apples. Loud ironical cheers and calls for
Fulton resounded through the Town Hall, and de-
risive and uncomplimentary epithets were con-
tinuously hurled at Moodie, who, for all that could
be heard of his—we can’t help it, Copeland, old
boy!—of his “ remarsh,” might have been singing
comic songs with a tol-di-rol-de-rlddle chorus.
That night, John E. was serenaded with cat-calls
outside his hotel, and Moodie hid in a coal-cellar
and lay covered with a corn-sack until morning.
We next encountered Fulton at a place called
Laura, where he had a gift-show, which he
modestly termed “ Barnum’s Great Comedy Com-
bination, direct from America.” The entertain-
ment consisted of a “veinous” old panorama of
“ A Journey through Scotland,” and was managed
by the faithful Teuton we have mentioned. This
retainer used to lecture until every possible shilling

audience stood an hour of this, all expectant for
the gifts. When, however. It was discovered that
one trooper got the tea-service, the other
the oofteerset, and the Police Magistrate’s
son the kitchen clock, the audience rose as one
man, and went outside to look for bricks. They
way-laid John that night, and bombarded his
puggy to such an extent with eggs and rooks, that

lot to witness. This took Fulton away, and he
heard Jt!? p alace Hotel, ’Frisco,

guilty, for no one was ever found guilty of any-
thing but feloniously distributing tracts at St,

pull him through several murders. Talk of
Adonis!—but ask the ballet, who adored him. And
that reminds u« of a man we know who started
a show by means of the ballet once. He
engaged twenty - five “ shapely ladies ” for
a chimerical pantomime, and got each to
deposit 16s. as security for her “ tights.” There
were no '* tights,” of course; and at the end of the
week, in collusion with the stage-manager, ho
altered the hour of rehearsal suddenly, and
fined them a week’s salary all round for being an
hour late!

Captain Fournier, who engineered the
treaty with China, is said to be the youngest
captain in the French navy, and he is 43. A navy,
over the heads of whose youngest captains more

battle of the Nile. Before Wellington was 40 he
had been victor at Assaye, Yimeira. and Talavera.
Disraeli simply exaggerated a truth when he
wrote, “the history of heroes is the history of

closed to men in that decade of their live* that
terminates at 40, there is but slight hope of its
tactics extorting a world’s admiration either by
brilliant originality or splendidly audacious elan.

—was introducing some of the members to His
Excellency, who had recently been installed. ‘This,

R. H., better known as “Bobby,” Rhodes
died recently at Christchurch (N.Z.), leaving an
estate valued at £600,000. Bobby was one ot the
very few extremely wealthy men in the world
whom nobody envied, and with whom, probably,
the poorest whiteman in New Zealand, or any-
where else, would not have desired to change
places in every respect. The deceased gentleman,
during the last decade of his existence, was an ob-
ject of pity to all with whom he came in contact,
whether rich or poor. He was afflicted with some
kind of leprosy, which all the skill of the medical
fraternity was unable to cure. At one time, how-
ever. some years ago, when he was at death s door,
h© was saved from immediate dissolution by being
burled for a time up to the chin in the pure virgin
soil of his adopted country. There ar-, probably,
many other disorders which a similar course ot
treatment might beneficially for
instance, and we recommend it for A. G. Taj lor s
legs. They are getting too rotund.
When it was necessary to designate a great
man down South, at one period of colonial his-
tory. all you had to do was to smack your lips and
■av Berry.” Time brings changes, however; and
the oldest resident, when he takes his stand on the
rubbish-heaplabuttlng Prince’s Bridge,rand gyrates
wound the philosophy of things, finds that there is
no statement truer in the whole complex region of
ect, science, and lellgion than that wmch is
summed up in the enduring sentence. Things
isn’t now as they used to was. No, they re not.
You can’t reach the ne plus ultra of greatness now
by saying “ Berry,” simply. There are more of
that name at present swaggering around the South
than there were in the Innocent childhood of the
towering State. There’s D. Berry there now. It
peed not be observed by those with first-class
memories for profanity that the sound of
appellation is not altogether new. The D , as
applied to the recently risen Berry, represents a
basin of baptismal water and a guinea fee. You
must therefore say D. Berry or G. Berry, as you
want to bring one or other of the two great men
before your mental vision. And who. some be-
nighted foreigner may ask, is D. Berry, or what
special claim has he to be considered eminent m a
colony where great men are as numerous as pats
of butter in a dairy? Well, first, D. Berry is a
man; secondly, he is a clergyman: thirdly, he is a
college man; and, fourthly, he is the only man in
Melbourne who has taken up Joseph Syme s chal-
lenge about the divinity of Christianity. It is in
his character of “ only man ” his claim lies.
Mr. Jager delivered a very interesting
lecture some nights ago in'.the Melbourne Coffee
Palace. It was in connection with the Tonic bol ha
Association, and dealt with the musical instru-
ments ofHhe Bible. The lecturer let light into the
ksobwebbedjrecesses of a lot of heads, from cer-
tain groups cut out on the tombs of dead Egyp-
tians and Assyrians, he showed that those old
people knew how to blow ,the fog-horn and tin
whistle and thump the big drum, almost as well as
xthose accomplishments are now known. And he
naively observed that where the knowledge of
how to commit the nuisance was present, you
might bet your boots that that the actual com-
mission was a fact. Hearers rubbed their scalps
«t this. Why, hearers had fancied that these
nuisaaces were of modern invention altogether.
No matter, however. Mr. Jager was not long be-
fore he informed everybody that every man of
the inventors was now dead. That consoled the
hearers somewhat. The information was not as
complete as might be desired, lor there was an
evident wish to have the same result of all who
followed in the Inventors’ footsteps. Time, how-
ever. will bring that about. “ A time will come,
said Mr. Jager, “ in which the musicallnstruments
of our day will be described just as I describe
these of the Babylonians and Assyrians.” ‘And
will the instruments be out on .their tombs like it
was on the B’s. and A’s?” asked some of the cob-
webbed people. “Probably,” replied Mr. Jager.
“Then, hal ha!” cried the people, “revenge is
■weet, and we’ll have it.” And a vote of thanks
to the lecturer was carried without a dissenting
voice, the meeting breaking up with cries of
* Ha, hal Revenge Is sweetr
The morganatic marriage of the Grand
Duke of Hesse on the day that his daughter was
iarried to Prince Lqui? Bfittoahurg seems tq
have been an odd business altogether. It now
seems as though the Queen wasn't displeased at ail
or else didn't know of the marriage when she
quitted Darmstadt, as the Grand Duke went over
to Windsor with her I That’s another queer fact
of itself. Within a day or two of the marriage the
husband was at Windsor, and the morganatic wife
at St. Petersburg. She, by the way, is Polish with
a streak of Hebrew, and rumour alleges that she
was a very great friend of a Polish Count who used
to live on his wits in London, and was on the best
of terms with the highest personages. She is a
musical amateur of the intensest kind, and an
original. One explanation of the Queen s com-
plaisance to the Grand Duke is that she had pre-
vailed on him to repudiate his marriage almost as
soon as it was divulged, and that stops are to be
taken to cancel it altogether. No clergyman
officiated. It was celebrated by Baron Von Stark,
the Hessian Minister of State, as a civil ceremony.
Another queer tact is that Prince Lou's of Batten-
burg, who married the daughter of the Grand
Duke, the Queen's grand-daughter, is himself the
offspring of a morganatic marriage, and his family
history is altogether peculiar. His brother. Prince
Alexander, was repudiated by his father, who
asserted that both Alexander and his sister were
begotten by a Master of the Horse. The sister,
however, was sought in marriage by the late Czar,
and duly became Czarina, whereupon the old
Grand Duke found it convenient to shut up, albeit
he had repudiated his old wife and taken to him-
self a morganatic spouse, Prince Louis mother.
Pretty Connie Gilchrist has been staying
down at Badminton, the honoured guest of the
naughty old Duke of Beaufort, and the delectable
spectacle of the amiable Duchess driving the
Gaiety damsel over to the meet has been striking
consternation to the hearts of some of the sur-
rounding country squires. Connie herself must
have felt that she was playing in the funniest bur-
lesque she ever had a part in, and the general
opinion of “society" at home is that the Duke
came it “ a bit too strong ” in flaunting his fascin-
ating young friend in the face of his wife and
family. Anyway, though, little Gilchrist is a clever
girl, and plays her cards well. Transferred from
the music halls to the boards of the Gaiety Theatre
while yet only a child —fourteen years ot age
Connie soon became (to quote her own proud
boast) “the youngest girl in London to have a
brougham of her own.” The skipping rope
dance” first brought her Into notice, and the
“ friendship ” of the mashera-led by the venerable
Duke, who is more than old enough to stand in tbe
relationship of grandfather—has kept her there.
Connie wasn’t more than seventeen when W rustler
painted her as the “GoldGirl” with her yellow
tresses hanging down a somewhat scraggy back.
Someone wrote some drivelling verses, too, under
the same heading, If we remember rlghtly-every-
thing, in fact, was done to make Connie the
fashion. And, although she can t dance half as
well as Kate Vaughan, nor sing worth a cent, still
Connie is unmistakeably smart, and may one day
make a big name for herself as an actress, Mr.
and Mrs. Florence, the American artistes, were
very much taken with her when she played a small
part in their “Mighty Dollar/' and offered her an
engagement in the States. But, just at present,
while enjoying the run of ducal residences, Connie
doesn’t need to devote much time to the profes-
sion, and, as with many another leading actress of
the present day, her best talents won t be de-
veloped until admirers begin to drop off. By the
bye, like her rival, Kate Vaughan. Connie has a
sister (Marie) who is much lower down the theatri-
cal ladder than herself. Marie has never' got higher
than the music halls* and, not being 1 a Gold Girl
dukes and duchesses know her not.
Young Power, the Times correspondent,
who was locked up with Chinese Gordon in Khar-
toum, has a history almost as eventful as his com-
patriots, M'Gahan and O'Donovan. He is the son
of a late manager of the National Bank, Dublin, a
nephew of Richard Lalor, M.P. for Queen s
County,Ireland,and of the Hon. Peter of that name.
Speaker of the Victorian Assembly. Power was
educated partly in Belgium, and partly in Austria,
and went through the Servian and Russo-Turkish
campaigns as journalist and semi-military attache
to the Austrian officers. His yarns concerning
this campaign, told on his return to admiring
Bohemian brethren of the Dublin press, earned
for him the title of “ Ghazl the Magnificent. It
was Power of whom Kdmund 0’Donova.n wrote,
prior to starting with the ill-fated Hicks expedi-
tion, as being ill with fever in his tent; it was this
fever which detained him in Khartoum, and en-
abled him to knock the other “specials out of
time. Power is an artist as well as a journalist; and
an American admirer asserts that the Ghazi
can 1 ' write book reviews with an air of profound
erudition—make witty paragraphs with a flavour
of Attic salt in every line of them—write love ron-
deaus, and triolets, and vers de sociiti, the melody
of whose words will linger In your ear for half a
day after you have heard them—and that he has
written novels three volumes long. The Royal
Hibernian Academy of Ireland have hung three of
his pictures at their annual exhibitions. He can
talk in four or five languages, and sing drinking
songs in a dozen. He can fence like a Frenchman,
ride like an Irishman, box like an Englishman, and
waltz like an Austrian hussar. Power is in aU
things characteristically Irish. His mother lived
in what West Briton apes call “ Murrlon Squeer,
the most fashionable spot in all Dublin; but the
Ghazi ” was seldom seen there. He was living in
lodgings, enduring hardships which only his inti-
mates kucw, often trudffingr the streets ail night
because he chose the anti-rent ticket* those
occasions he generally breakfasted on a pig s foqt
and a bottle of stout, the nett cost of which in
Dublin is 4d. Power is only 27 years of age; and
his title of “The Ghazi,” which is apt to stick, was
earned by his many affectionate references to
Ghazi Mouhtar Pash i.
Miss Alice S. Burvett writes to the Even-
ing News pitching into the musical critic of the
8. M. Herald, because, the critic, after taking the
pains to ascertain the name of an encore piece,
mentioned another by the same composer in the
published report, also because three instead of one
of the pieces played by Miss Burvett had not been
previously played by her in Sydney, and finally
because the critic had mentioned that the con-
cert commenced late. Miss Burvett writes that
“ it is a pity for the profession (not residing in
Sydney at least) that this newspaper should have
for musical critic a lady who presumes to know so
much about music, but who, somehow, finds ’t
necessary to make such inquiries as, for instance,
whether Weber’s ‘Polonaise,’ which I played,
was in E flatl” Miss Burvett would hve been
better advised had she kept her annoyance to her-
self. The lady who writes the critiques for the 8.
M. Herald has by this time established her repu-
tation among musical connoisseurs In Sydney, for
better or worse, past the possibility of being
affected by a single slip of the pen, or by the spite-
ful protestations of a mortified professional. We
know a good deal more about her qualifications
than Miss Burvett is likely to for years to come,
and if Miss Burvett were anything like so capable
a pianiste as the Herald’s representative is com-
petent as a musical critic, we have no doubt that
the best feelings would reign. The real state of
the case is quit# evident. It isn’t this one
critique which has provoked Miss Burvett.
That young pianiste was launched here with an
amount of pretension which her actual abilities
were quite inadequate to sustain. The S.M.
Herald’s critic judged Miss Burvett on
her merits, and dealt with her perform-
ances discnminatively. We have read all the
Herald critiques, we believe, and all we have
read we have concurred with. Their sense has
been plain, and, to our mind, their expression has
been merciful. Our own impressions and notices
have been in complete accord. To put the thing in
a nutshell, Miss Burvett tried to do Kettan busi-
ness here. She was not nearly good enough. There
are a lot of better pianistes than she in Sydney, who
would never have attempted to give unassisted
pianoforte recitals, and who would have failed to
draw audiences if they had. The Herald 8 critic
may have made a mistake in a matter of dr tall in
her last report, but she has certainly made no mis-
take in her general estimate of Miss Burvett s
status as a pianiste.
Mr. Moncure Conway has been saying
more—and worse—about Australia. We have no
literary judgment. We have no artistic taste.
Which means that we had no money for Monoure.
This fact is, for its pathos, principally Indebted to
Its truth. We had no money for him. Conse-
quently when he got back !to London, he could
not afford to drink much champagne over the
profits of his Australian tour. That is to say, if
h 3 does drink—a matter of which we are not sure;
though, if he never did before, we think he must
have taken to it somewhat enthusiastically since
he wont home, Judging by the tone of some of his
late lectures. But. though Mr. Conway has chosen
to say some bitter things about us, we shall say
nothing bitter of him. Still, in onr own defence
we will say that, as a rule almost without excep-
tion, only men who have come out here empty-
headed have gone home empty-handed. If any
person, whatever he may be, has anew and worthy
thought, or theory, or fact, or performance to
show to us, he will have no reason to complain of
our lack of either literary judgment or artistic
taste. But, he must be able to justify himself
upon the Piazza.” If there are any more pseudo-
philosophers, or second-hand sages in Europe, who
think they have only to some out to Australia
with some coloured beads and brass buttons in a
satchel, to dazzle us into making their fortunes for
them, let them take warning in time by the fate
of Moncure Conway. He happened to be able to
get home again. They might not have such luck.
And then ?—the Statue and the Domain. Before
we finish with this subject, we think we will pre-
sent Mr. Conwav with a few little verses, which
may help to brighten up the next lecture in which
he has occasion to speak of Australia. Here they
are:—
We have received a note, written in a bold
and original style, from Seymour, a small town-
ship in victoria, chiefly remarkable for support-
ing two editors on half a paper. The note is from
Charles Fuller, of the "Stray Leaves” Company,
and is written in superior handwriting on superior
hotel-paper. It informs us that the company has
been doing handsome business in Victoria—a
?hrase which we would translate, handsome does
hat handsome is. The first time we saw Mr.
Fuller was when we were in Queanbeyan, deriv-
ing a precarious income, partly from editing one of
the local papers and partly from playing the ac-
cordion at bush-balls. In those halcyon times, we
used to stand at the olfloe-door, or sit down on the
footbridge in front, and stare across the street at a
splay-footed butcher, who stared stolidly back at
us and gnawed a skewer. Both of us were waiting
for something to come down the street—a dog, or
a Chinaman, or the parson's horse, it mattered
little what, as long as it moved and could be made
to howl—that we could throw a stone at. When
we had thrown the stone, we were satisfied, and
used to go inside till the flatness of life again got
the better of us, and we were driven forth once
more to stare at each other with intensified
stolidity, and look for fresh excitement. Whisky
was no break to the monotony of being down
there: it was the atmosphere- Dog-fights also had
no great attraction, as most of the dogs were too
broken-soirited to fight after the first round. All
was despondency and gloom. Literally, the most
cheerful man in the place was the undertaker.
And he had the most hope-inspiring name for an
undertaker that we have ever heard of. Lazarus
he was called, and his jocularity was appalling.
When you looked into his eye, you saw your own
image, but you saw more. You saw your chin tied
up, your arms crossed over your breast, copper
coins on your eyes, and a coffin with the lid off
lying ready beside your bed. This coffin was not
too large nor too small, too light nor too heavy,
too plain nor too ornamental. It was your exact
measure; it was to your exact taste. And why?
Because, in his first look at you, this devil of an
undertaker had guaged the size of shell you would
take to an inch, and in all subsequent casual con-
versations his hidden purpose was to worm out of
you whether your tastes inclined to the sumptuous
or the severe, the rose-wood of the rich or the
plain deal of the poor. He never touched any-
thing stronger than treacle-water himself, but he
took a lively interest in those who drank sterner
stuff. The men who were his meat he knew at a
glance; and they knew it, too, and drank the
harder to drown the thought. So he was merry
when all else were mournful; and as he came up
the road in the morning, his face, transfigured with
yellow soap and water, shone like one of his own
breastplates, or the golden helmet of Mambrino,
which turned out to be a barber’s basin. Much of
the gloomy glee with which our present writing is
infected we caught from conversation with this
unique undertaker during intervals of leisure al-
lowed us by our musical and editorial duties—which
Intervals wore nearly all the time. From him we
derived a ghoulish taste for following funerals at
our own invitation, and mourningjover the grave,
of people we never saw, at our own expense. In
the middle of all this miasma of despond came
Charles Fuller. What times we had during the two
or three days he was thorel What whisky we

of a piano that had in it as much music as an old

The S.M. Herald, in a two-column review
of the published “Life of the Princess Alice,”
managed to suppress all reference to the most
striking circumstance connected with that excel-
lent woman. The Princess Alice was a declared
Freethinker during all those years! of her married
life in which her virtues as a woman, as a wife, as
a mother, and as a daughter, so embellished her
station. Tnere is no question that Alice was an
admirable woman: the flower of the Royal flock,
her father’s darling, and her mother’s tender
counsellor and friend. Her wedded life, despite
troubles and sorrows which brought her nearer
than any of the family to the great world of work-
a-day folks, was, in the main, exceedingly happy—
a condition in no small degree due to her own
beautiful character and loveable disposition. Her
husband, who has now so oddly exhibited a dis-
graceful disrespect for her memory, was, while
she lived, entirely devoted to her: and, by every
token of genuine affection, illuminated her life
with the joy of domestic happiness. In letters,
written at intervals of several years, she bears
testimony to the fact that it was not a mere honey-
moon fondness which subsisted between her
and her husband. In one, she writes: “ There is
such a feeling of security, and we two have a world
of our own when we are together, which nothing
caw touch or intrude upon. My lot is indeed a
blessed one, and yet what have i done to deserve
that warm, ardent love which my darling Louis
ever shows me ? I admire his good and noble heart
more than I can say,” Two years afterwards, the
Princess says: “Our life is a very happy one. I
have nothing on earth to wish for, and much as I
loved my precious Louis when I married him, still
more do I love him now and daily.” The pair were
all the time not only as poor, comparatively, as
church mice, but absolutely harassed by duns. It
doesn’t seem to have been altogether, if at all,
their fault, either. Prince Louis had been
pretty wild In hie younger days, no doubt,
and had been reckless in money matters. But
he is scarcely blamoable, as he had been led
| into financial indiscretions by his own father,
who seems to have encouraged him to be ex-
travagant, in order that he might find him-
self in a fix, and, consequently, well-disposed to
join in encumbering certain entailed estates,
which could not have been hypothecated without
his concurrence as heir. His father’s affairs were
frightfully embarrassed long before he. Prince
Louis, had arrived at years of discretion; and as,
when he came of age he joined with his father in
encumbering the family property, he was obliged,
throughout his wedded life, to make all kinds of
sacrifices to keep the old man afloat and steer his
own barque as well. The Hesse-Darmstadt family
has? long been hard-up. They used to sell their
i subjects for soldiers to England, at the time of
the American War of Independence, and right up
to the fall of Napoleon. Later on, one reason given
to Parliament for the Crimean War was that
Russia had sought for influence in Germany, by
paying the debts of the Duke of Hesse-Darmstadt;
the Czarwitch of that day being son-in-law to the
Duke then reigning. Of course the poverty of a
Prince’s household is a relative term. It la pro-
bably fraught with some mortifications which a
common person would escape, but it never touches
the real misery point, in which, after every insult,
mortification and indignity become chronic, and
actual celd and hunger afflict the sufferer, chil-
dren cry for bread, and are thrown into depraved
company, and afflicted by poisonous surroundings
both moral and physical ; babes starve at the
breast, and death is an escape rather than an ill.
The gentle Alice suffered in her degree. Magulfl.
cence was denied to her, and she had even some
actual discomforts. But the bitterest drops were, of
course, unknown to her. She seems never to have
made her troubles occasion for actual complaint.
The sweetness of her disposition, and her
strong sense, saved her from that. But the
instances she gives of her worries indicate how
far remote they were after all from the real agonies
of the world’s poor. Thus she writes: “ We have
sold four carriage horses, and have only six to
drive with now, two of which the ladies constantly
want for theatres, visits, &c.; so we are rather
badly off in some things.” The straitness of the
family’s means did not prevent their building a
new house—on tick. The result, very simply re-
corded in one of Alice’s letters, brings to mind the
incident of Buggies, the ex-butler, who had let his
house in Mayfair to Colonel Crawley and Becky,
his wife. Writes the Princess: “The man who
built our house has nearly been made bankrupt,
and wants money from us to save him from ruin,
and we can scarcely manage it.” The fate of “ the
man ” is not disclosed in subsequent correspond-
ence; but it seems that even the furniture of the
new house was obtained on the “time-payment
system.” On receiving a present of money from
her mother, the poor Princess writes: “ The money
will go at once to Louis’s man of business towards
paying off the furniture, and, is, indeed, very, very
acceptable, more so under present circumstances
than anything else you could give us; and that
part of the furniture will then all be your pre-
sent.” Poor Princess Alice I She was a good
woman. Her character is embosomed in charms.
In every domestic relation she showed herself an
examole worthy of universal imitation, and the
strength of her intellect was disclosed no less by
the degree in which she emancipated herself
from the traditional system of training which
corrupts the minds of Royal personages by
the misconception that the peop e exist for
their benefit, and not they for the benefit
of the people, than by the independence with
which she liberated herself from the shackles o f!
orthodoxy, in her best years. It is, indeed, a most
notable tact that, during the very time when the
Princess Alice was most actively displaying virtues
which endear her memory alike to the people of
Darmstadt and of England, she was an earnest
Freethinker. In 1870, when the Princess’s husband
and children got the scarlet fever, she nursed them
herself. During the forced seclusion, she became
acquainted with David Strauss, the theo.'ogian ;
and .the Princess, with that courage of opinion
which was characteristic of her, allowed him to
dedicate to her his work on Voltaire, which ap-
proved of the French philosopher in many essen-
tial points. It has been said, indeed, that she re-
canted, later. But the authority for this is more
than dubious. Her last illness was very short
Orthodoxy never fails to allege either a recanta-
tion or a frightful death-bed. To allege the latttr
with respect to a Princess so universally beloved
as Alice of England would have been injudicious.
The former was safer. No doubt the same will be
said of Alice’s sister, the Princess Boyal of England
and Crown Princess of Germany, when she
dies. But as she is still alive, and a proiouncel
Freethinker, silence is the present expedient.
Dead people cannot contradict falsehoods about
themselves. Live people cau.
There went forth over the world a wail of
grief; and we wailed with the rest. In a ditch be-
ind the Castlemaine brewery, in Melbourne, wi.s
found —so it was voluminously reported—the
mangled and outraged form of the once well-
known and notorious “Lady Munro,” who was
stated to be sister to Lady Mordaunt, and also -we
S‘:e the Newcastle Hanby— “ a daughter of the
of Dudley;” though, how this can be, when
Lady Mordaunt’s father is Sir Thomas Moncrlefl.
we can’t quite understand. Hold on, thought Now
we come to think of it, the but it’s none of our
business 1 The ejaculation of George II.’s dying
Queen, somehow, occurred to us, “ Cela n’empechc
pas!" Comprenny ? Well, when the sad news of
Lady Munro's untimely end got abroad, there was
hardly a rag in the country whose bard did n«t
trickle forth his little stream of poetry. Here s
some of what our poet coughed up, but which was
crowded out, at the last moment, by an unlooked-
for theatrical “ card ” :—
MUNRO.—A MEMORY.
In her cold and solemn shell,
Loi a grave man came and kissed her:
In his eyes the tears did well,
For he loved that fallen sister 1
Through the haze of silv’ry gauze
Shed the moon her soft pale sheen,
As amidst a solemn pause
He thought what she might have been!
“ Gone,” he moaned, “ to thy last rest,”
And with grief he seemed to choke;
“ Lay a chaplet on her breast, ’
And went off to weep—and smoke.
The Brunswick Banner was, if not so musical
at least considerably more practical. Witness.—
! A DENIAL. •
; Munro dead in a brew’ry ditch,
* Yesterday morning was found, sirs;
; Some blame our boys for this crime, which'
• The poor things never did, sirs.
The Sandridoe Signal took a more lofty flight:—
Say, who is that in diadem crowned
That whirls in merry valse around,
Her face with pride aglow:
A duke her partner—rapture rare I
To clasp, thinks he, that form so fair ?—
It is the gay Munro.
Who is it that stiff, stark, we see
Stretched out behind a breweree?
Oh, horror!—is it so ?
Her eyebrow shows a patch of mud.
Her heart has ceased its gentle thud—
It is, alas, Munro.
We think, however, that Behmagui Dispatch is
entitled, on the whole, to clutch the Sally Lunn:—
“ONE MORE UNFORTUNATE,” ETC.
It seems but yestreen since we gazed on this waif.
And heard her gay laugh in the walls of a kafe;
Beheld her, at dawn, with a swell so rekerky.
Discussing with laughter the “ gold top ” and tur-
key!
So merry and blithe was this pretty Munro I
With what grace she could kick off a squatter s
chapeau!
But now it appears we shan’t see her encore,
For it is reported poor Munro is Mart! *
These are only a few of hundreds of elegies, and
her ladyship has had as many biographical pars.

written about her as Archibald Forbes. Well, we
have no sooner wept over her and burled her—the
last sound of the harp has hardly died away upon
the wintry breezes—than we light upon the fol-
lowing in the Newcastle Herald “ A female
known by the police as ‘ Mrs. Munro,’ of Sydney,
reputed to be a daughter of the Earl of Dudley,
and sister to Lady Mordaunt, was at the Victoria
Theatre last night. As usual, she became erratic,
and narrowly escaped expulsion by the police.”
Subsequent enquiries reveal to us the humiliat-
ing fact that after the play, the “ Earl of Dudley’s
daughter ” put her aristocratic foot through an
oyster-shop window, bombarded a cab-stand with
baked potatoes, and was last seen smoking a pipe
on Bullock Island, and entertaining the crew of a
collier brig with reminiscences of her life amongst
the aristocracy. Lady M. has, we understand, to
receive her money shortly; so we may expect to
gee her in Sydney at any moment. We may re-
mark, that generally when going for her “ loot ’*
(£50 a quarter), her ladyship is accompanied by a
suite of ladles and gentlemen whose proclivities are
peculiar; and LadyM. not unfrequently finds her-
self, on the morning after her remittance, wrapped
up in a chalf-bag, and lying on a tombstone.

TIME PAYMENT.
It is possible tbat the readers of Thb
Bulletin may detect, in the following sketch, an
element of hauteur, which is not, as a rule, a dis-
tinguishing characteristic of the ingenuous articles
which invariably appear in this journal—articles
which are clothed alike in the roseate garb of
modesty and enveloped (if we may so state it) in
tae poncho of poesy.
* * •
The fact is, we have moved. Now, all pleas©
bend down at once, and we will burst up the whole
conspiracy. We have taken a house, and fur-
nished it on time-payment; and, we have found
the result to be funnier than any comic paper-
alive or dead. As a matter of fact, ever since we
took possession of our “ commodious family resi-
dence ” our ear has been on the hearthrug and
our feet on the fender. The house for which we
have contracted is, on the whole, a feeble resi-
dence. It has a garden in front which is a howl-
ing desert, and a back yard which is an insult to
the neighbourhood. At the time we write, we are
encamped in this luxurious abode. It has become
patent to us that meteorological mystery painfully
pervades the precincts of our mansion. Most of
the wall-paper evinces a disposition to peel off and
emigrate, while that portion which is still loyal to
the incoming tenant, displays, with curious exact-
ness, maps of Norway and Sweden in every apart-
ment,
• • •
We don’t mind reiterating, although it is a
delicate thing, that we have furnished our residence
on the time-payment system. The time-payment
system is a gorgeous institution ; and wo will, in
future, keep a brick to drop on the man who in-
vented it, should he pass our way. When in treaty
for the luxurious furniture, which we madly sup-
posed would be the envy of the neighbourhood,
vre were, at the hands of the furniture-man, effu-
sively received. He was a fair, we may remark,
blue-eyed, chestnut-bearded, Jew. His manner
was fatherly; and, taking us round to the back of
a second-hand copper, he assured us, with much
emotion, that he knew no guile. On our
broaching the subject of time-payment, he
begged us to believe that money to him was the
veriest dross, and that what little profit he made
by labouring dally for eighteen hours he lavished
ou the deaf, the lame, the blind, and the indigent.
There was no hedge (we are referring now to the
Scriptures) so far as we could gather, no ditch, no
sewer he did not explore in search of the poor and
needy. “ I find my reward,” he said, in tremulous
tones—“ I find my reward in the consciousness ®f
alleviating the wants of my fellow-creatures. The
love of gain is with me,” he continued, “a thing
Of the past. In my shop,” he went on, huskily,

each one with a halo yellower than the yellowest
butter; each one with a trump which would fetch,
through the influence of uivine Providence, a
higher C than was ever clutched by Levy. I want
but little inafter-lile,” he went on, with emotion;
a couch hollowed out of a single pearl, a raiment
blade exclusively of sunshine, a bell-topper fash-
ioned solely from moonbeams, and a pair of wings
that have upen them that silvery sheen of which
fWtop so eloquently sings.” ‘‘Is that all you
want? ’ wo asked, timidly. "That la all,” said he,
with a sigh. . . And then he proceeded to make
out our little list.

ing out of the side of the bellows gave him a celd
m the eye. The lamp is simply a deep and bloody
insult. Set up upon the mantelpiece it stands out
a monument of iniquity. As an ornament, is has
its attractions ; as a lamp it is abject. The
furniture of the bedrooms is one grisly spec-
tacle- But, it must be stated that, embo-

of humour. The legs of the various beds
resemble those of camels; and one ordinarily long

wish you were dead; and when you shave with the

that the teapot Is drunk, and the coffee-pot
possesses a leak which amounts, on festive occa-
sions, to a perfect squirt. However, it Is a matter

The Singer Sewing Machine
ARRANGEMENTS TO SECURE THE
AUSTRALIAN TRADE.
SINGER, THE BENEFACTOR OF HIS AGE.
The mechanical scientists have been the real
kings of modern time. While some men have
fought for and Won renown on the battle field at
a huge sacrifice of human life, there have been
others engaged in the field of mechanical Inven-
tion who have won empires in the hearts of men
of every nationality, by reason of the world-wide
benefits of their genius. And undoubtedly one of
the men who pre-eminently deserves a pinnacle of
imperishable fame is that great benefactor of
modern time, I. M. Singer. His was a genius which
knew no border-line, but which conferred on
Europe and Australia alike the good wrought in
his own country. William Cobbett, England’s
stern reformer and historian, always stoutly main-
tained that the heroes of the sword sank infinitely
below the men who devoted their talents to peace-
fully ameliorating the condition of mankind by
lessening human toil and improving the moans of
human subsistence. And fitly, therefore, can it he
said of Singer, the inventor, that he well deserves
a front place in the gallery of modern benefactors.
The story of his life is of thrilling Interest —a
career of patient observation and plodding work,
and repeated disappointments and ill-successes in
his efforts to master a yet unknown principle, till at
last he is found grasping that triumph of scientific
mechanism, the Singer sewing-machine, which
gave the world, as it were, a lift into prosperity,
and struck the shackles for ever from tens of
thousands of toiling hands. Thejinvention of the
Singer sewing-machine, and the speed and perfec-
tion to which its manufacture was soon brought,
increased tenfold the capabilities of every house-
hold furnished with such an appliance; and the
manufactories being smilarly affected, it caused a
complete revolution in that essential of life, the
1 production of clothing. And just as the wide-
stretching fields of America opened new granaries
1 to starving Europe, so did The Singer Manufactur-
ing Works spread broadcast great and permanent
benefits. Upwards of five millions of these splendid
little appliances have been turned out of the works;
and after 25 years’ experience they continue to be
produced and sold at the rate of over 600,000 per
year. As the Singer machine represents the labour
of ten hands, it can be calculated from these
figures the extra saving of labour called into the
world’s assistance by Singer’s great Invention.
Over and over again, at every exhibition and con-
test in Europe, America, India, and Australia, for
the last 25 years, the Singer sewing-machine has
been declared the perfection of mechanism—the
simplest, solldest, and best made appliance ever
produced—and the solid gold and silver medals
awarded the invention during that period would
together cover the faces of two large-sized billiard-
tables. Last year the sales of the Singer totalled
the enormous number of 650,293, which means that
over 2000 of the machines are made and sold every
working day of the year—being exactly at the rate
of three out of every four of the whole sewing-
machine production of the whole world. If this is
not a triumph for mechanical genius, it would be
well to know what is. The Singer Company have
an active working capital of £5,000,000-a trifle
over the annual expenditure of the two rising
colonies of N.S.W. and Victoria—and employment
is given all the year round to not less than 50,000
> hands. During the last few years the great firm,
having established additional works in Scotland to
meet the trade of the United Kingdom and the
colonies, have taken steps to have Australia par-
ticularly well attended to. During the last few
years, Mr. Fernie, the Australian representative of
The Singer Manufacturing Company, has been
establishing branches and bringing the business of
the whole group under one central head. For
some considerable time the source of colonial
supply has been the central dep6t at Darling
Harbour, Sydney, and these extensive warehouses
are still maintained; but Mr. Fernie has deemed it
advisable to be represented in the business centres
of, the great metropolis. To this end, he has
secured splendid premises in Pitt-street, on the
site of Moore's old Labour Bazaar—a spot of his-
toric interest, known from end to end of our
island continent. On this site Mr. Fernie has a
spacious business house. The business part of the
warehouse has a depth of nearly 130ft., with a
width of nearly 60ft., and the arrangements are so
well designed that the front portion answers the
purpose of a splendid show-room, and the rear
for a suite of offices for the clerical and managerial
staffs. The whole space is splendidly lighted and
ventilated, and the show-room is vastly superior
to anything of the kind elsewhere in the colonies.
Entering from Market-street, there are nine floors,
giving a superficial area of floor space of about an
acre. These floors are magnificently fitted for
their various purposes—the cellars, the best in the
city, being designed for the reception of heavy
machines and parts. On the ground floor is the
packing-room and the counting-house of the
invoice and shipping clerks. The next is occupied
by the staff of mechanics, cabinet-makers, and
French-polishers. The others hold the lighter
machines and the cabinet-work. On the top floor,
concealed amidst cases of black walnut is the
beautiful gas engine which works the patent hoist
with nearly the smoothness and precision of the
Singer machine itself. Mr. Fernie, the Australian
representative, has arranged for continued large
shipments of the Singer machines for every class
of domestic and factory use, and the whole of the
agencies throughout the colonies will be found
to be supplied with machines of every size and
price. The vastly increasing sales of the Singer
machines in the Australian colonies enable the
representative of this genuine appliance to make
as easy arrangements on the time-payment system
as the vendors of Inferior machines. That the
coming year’s business in these colonies will eclipse
the previous is certain—a proof that in Australia
people are as fully alive to what is best to buy as
elsewhere; and a proof also that the genius of the
great inventor. Singer, meets with real honest ap-
preciation, while base and flimsy imitators are
discarded and condemned.

raffle by the river stcamers-a very large trade
ndeed—and is one of the oldest established Hotels

The Test of Actual Trial. — This
what proves the merit of a preparation. The pro
prietor of Green’s August Flower, knowing Its
valuable properties, meets this test boldly by pre-
paring sample bottles of this remedy, which ar
sold at 6d. This enables doubters to try its virtue
at a trifling expense. August Flower is a panacea
for Dyspejasia and all disorders of the Liver, in
eluding Biliousness, Indigestion, Sick Headache
Costiveness, &c., &c. Three doses will relieve any
of the above, and a faithful use will certainly cure
No medicine in the world has ever given such
proof of its merits. Druggists recommend it with
perfect confidence and physicians prescribe 11

the Bristol.” Wybert Keeve has been away for a
tew days, land the boys he left behind—Coleman,
Hughes, and Whittington—have just been laying
themselves out to see now tightly they could pack
the place without bursting the walls. When any
uneasiness as to the ownership of reserved seats
occurred, the ushers Invariably sent the aggrieved
party to Hughes, the natty little rooster who
stands at the inside entrance. Hughes would send
them to Coleman, who stays In the office. Cole-
man, in turn, would direct them to see Whitting-
ton—“the man with a bad oold, who stands around
the front entrance.” Then Hughes and Coleman
would slip out the side-door, give Whittington the
wink, and all three would adjourn to a neighbour-
ing pub. to wash a baked potato or two down with
a bottle of lager. By the time they got back to
business, the “ man with a grievance ” had sold his
pass-check 1o somebody for a shilling, and gone
off to make a beast of himself with the proceeds.

The widow O’Brien grows more Irish, and
consequently more entertaining, as the season
progresses In that make-up, we believe, that
if Sheridan were to go anywhere near
8t. Mary’s Cathedral, the statue of Saint
Patrick would lump from its pedestal and climb
up on the fence to look over at him. If you
were to see his mouth open every time his
elbow bends, you would be puzzled to tell what
county he came from. You would know, how-
ever, that he was plther an Irishman or else a step-
cousin to the devil—which amounts to about the
same thing—when anybody treads on the tail of
his coat. Not that we mean to insinuate that Mr.
Sheridan drinks. We don’t believe that he does.
He is so little that a “ long-sleever ” would drown
him, anyway; and, If a glass of whisky got
Into his head but, there! That would be Im-
possible. There wouldn’t be room for It In
that little head of his, which is about as full now
as it can be of wit and wisdom and other things
too numerous to mention. The more we gee of
Sheridan’s acting the better we like it, but we
have to give him a jar occasionally to keep him
from getting too proud. We expect him to come
around after he has read this report, and give us a
jar or two—pickle jars, we mean—that will lay us
out cool as a cucumber. Come to think of it, we
are about as cool as a cucumber, anyway, and are
just as fond of a good lay-out (Eastway’s, for in-
stance,) as any free-lunch fiend in town. And this
reminds us that when we get through with a free
lunch, the carving knife, the skewer, and a piece
? f „ g X ee ?‘t ;op 5 ed . celei> y are the only things left to
tell the tale or the destruction we nave wrougrht
But If we linger over this free-lunch any longer!
we’ll never get through with the shows, and you’ll
be getting so hungry that you won’t sit them out.

E. C. Dunbar, who plays the troubadour,
ana wheezes through an antiquated Ice-cream
trumpet which he calls a musette, has a good
voice and is a good actor. When playing that
musette solo, he goes up to seventeen octaves In
G, and comes down hand over hand to the middle
of next week In Y. We were talking to him the
other day, when he told us that It took him twenty
years to accomplish what he has done, and we
were only sorry that he hadn’t put off being born
until after we are dead. The wail of the lost
spirit in that Instrument will linger in our ears to
our dying day. We actually believe that If we
had one of them to play on in the next world, old
Nick would give us a pot of brimstone and a few
matches, and send us off somewhere to build a
little hell of our own, just to get rid of us. Dun-
bar is a big fat man. When he began playing, he
was quite thin. Now, his audiences are thin, w\ille
Dunbar is so fat that he daren’t laugh for fear of
Dursting his skin.

bury it. The constable had to do It himself,
finally, and we are sure that he buried
it somewhere near a butcher’s shop, for we
tackled a saveloy two days later, and found
one of “ Grpwler’s” claws just where we weren’t
looking for it at all. We have little to criticise in
the Signora s acting; but it seemed to us that her
voice had hardly the clear, strong ring it had a few
months ago, and she has somewhere acquired the
habit of gasping at the beginning of sentences
that we never noticed in her speech before. Per-
haps Marie Antoinette used to talk that way. We
don’t know. We had not the pleasure of her
acquaintance, and are mighty glad of it. Most of
her intimate friends died off rather suddenly, and
there’s not one of them alive to-day. We would
rather be a live critic than a dead courtier, anv
day. Our family are all that way. There are just
twenty-nine brothers of us, and we are all boys.

Everything about the play went off first-
chop. At least, the heads of Louis Capet and
Marie Antoinette went off that way. And now
you would like to know who played the King.
Well, it was James Carden, and he played it away
beyond anything you have seen him do for months.
In the separation ” scene (sob here), whore he
takes leave of the Queen and the Dauphin and his
sister (sob here), just before going out to have his
head amputated (sob here), they are all so
deeply affected (double sob) that you want to
firet right up and bowl a hole through the
roof and run yaur soul through a mangle to
cheer you up again. Throughout this scene Gar-
de? 8 acting is really powerful, and he clutches
hold of the sympathies of the audience with a grip
that wrings the misery out of it in spite of all re-
sistance. Up to this hour he was courteous, kind,
and kingly, and yet It seemed to us that his man-
ner belonged more to an English than a French
court. Whm we were knocking about in the
French court years ago, the bearing of the king
and queen was less stiff and stately than that
assumed by Mr. Carden and the Signora. When
we first heard that Carden was going to play Louis
XVI. we rejoiced with a holy joy. We said: “ Now
we shall glut our vengeance on him for doing
some things about half as well as he might have
done them in days that are past. We shall see him
beheaded.” But he didn’t behead worth a cent-
er, at least, we were not permitted to witness the
execution, and that was another disappointment
in the piece. However, life is full of disappoint-
ments, and it is only a courageous soul like ours
that can hope on and drink beer and suffer.

D’Orsay Ogden, as Santerre, looked like
the leader of the unemployed. Santerre, you will
remember, was the Commander of the National
Guard who led on the revolutionists, and played
the very dickens with the dynasty. D’Orsay
played the “ brewer ” with a good deal
of vigour, but the author painted him hardly
savage enough. He almost raised a laugh or two,
and for that t he audience and ourselves shall al ways
remember him kindly. Like a young moon strug-
gling through a fog, he illumined the gloom for a
few moments, and then 'the darkness and misery
and horror set In again with increased intensity.
Even Harry Power, the clever comedian, was cast
for Vergnlaud. President of the Assembly, and
hadn t a line to speak that might relieve the woe-
stricken crowd. Mr. A. Rodney, as Simon the
Cobbler, is a hideous creation, but it.'was unreason-
ably overdrawn. He was not the kind of man who
could gain and hold the confidence of the National
Convention. In that “make-up,” he looked like
a cross between a Mormon elder and a pea-nut-
vendor that had been scared by a Queensland
alligator.

Miss Tottie Power, who played the Dau-
phin, did her work very cleverly. Madame Royale
was a little gushing at times, but that prayer at the
footlights was a stunner. Wo don’t know where
the poor girl could have learned it, but she got it
off just as though she knew the Lord first-rate and
what to say to please him. It struck us as being
a little too eloquent for a mere child, and then it
wasn t followed by the usual “ amens ” and pass-
ing the hat. But we have stayed long enough with
this misery out-fit, and are going up to the Min-
strels to see if they can’t cheer us up a bit. Satur-
day evening of this week Jennie Lee begins a
season of ‘Jo,” at the Opera House, and the piece
is destined for a successful run.

“ The Queen’s Favourite,” at the Royal, of
course, is having a good time. The action is cast
in the days of Queen Anne, whose death has, we
believe, been reported with some degree of autho-
rity. The drama is an adaptation of Scribe’s “ A
Glass of Water.” This Is a misnomer. “A Glass
of Toddy would have been more appropriate.
Because, you see, there’s a good deal of spirit in
it. Mr. Vernon comes out of his shell on this oc-
casion, and a very lively sort of crustacean he shows
himself to be. In the first act, he is Henry St. John,
and dead broke. In the remaining acts he is Boling-
broke. In the last piece (-‘Forget Me Not”), Mr
Vernon had all the worst of it; but in the peculiar
duet carried on between Viscount Bollngbroke
mad the Duchess of Marlborough (Miss Genevieve
ward), he has got a chance for revenge, and the
way he fences with the Duchess makes us green
w ®? v y because we’re not always “up to
snuff ’ like that. The Viscount and the Duchess
are both striving to gain the favour of their
Queen (Miss Flora Anstead), who vacillates from
one to the other until she made us think of the
mule who stood between two haystacks and
starved to death, because he didn’t know which
stack to begin on first.

TO CORRESPONDENTS.
[Corrctpondentt who give neither name nor nom-de-
plume cannot expect to have their com-
munication noticed .]
“Regans”; “Why are the clergy making
such a fuss about this religious business in State
schools ?” Why, dear boy, because they find the
ground slipping from under them. We were a
teacher once, and had to stand by while a kid read
Scripture stories we didn’t believe a word of. Of
course, ’twas monstrous to make us teach as true
old Jack-and-the-Bean-Stalk fables that even
Churchmen had exploded.... “William H.” : Will
see....“ W. H. L.Bailey” writes to say he has no
intention of “going” for the Cootamitndra
Herald — “ Artist ” : Wolff and Sons’ pencils are
equal, if not superior to any, for drawing and
offlce-work....“ Tomato”: Not adapted “R,
M’Lean” ; Coppin is still alive. He was a member
of the Victorian Parliament....“ J.M,” ; We have
always deprecated the introduction of the cat-o’-
nlne-tails, but, since the receipt of your sketch,
feel disposed to look into the thing again. Twenty-
flve would do you no harm, at any rate
‘Briton”: Yes; Bismarck’s attitude has completely
knocked the sawdust out of Jamie Service’s splen-
did dream. Why should England interfere ? What
would she gain by it, but the frothy acclamations
of men and journals who would never think of
helping her out of a difficulty. Do you think that
far-seeing English statesmen [are to be taken in by
the transparent fustian of Service and Co.? Go to....
‘ Clcricos” : We have thus far withheld comment
on the matter you deal with, out of respect for the
innocent sufferers. We have so many proofs now
that the business is a common scandal, that we
begin to consider whether we do well in keeping
silence. If the Bishop doesn’t fire out his canon, it’s
clear somebody else will need to apply the match..
G.L. : All right; but we are aweary of little
Bailey and the teapot tempests which perpetually
rage around him. As to Paul Pry and his sorrows,
we are unmoved. It’s constitutional, we suppose.
The sorrows of St. Paul never got a tear from us.
— “ H.M/’; Thanks. ..“M.B.” : Neat, and wel-
come... ‘Duplex”; You’ve stretched your “yarn”
too long and thin.Spy”: Yes, please continue ..
8. 8. Field : Not of any value “G.E.F.”: No
such scene as you speak of was introduced in Mel-
bourne. The parties of whom you speak had
every reason to desire the escape of the supposed
murderer, in order to distract attention from
themselves..." Redfern Subscriber”: Well meant;
but we could scarcely put in those few.


PEPPER AND SALT.
If the S.M, Herald's Paris correspondent.
“Stella,” docs not soon shift her quarters from
Murrurundi, she will get as clean a bowl out as
Alf.’s Moscow correspondent did, when, by mis-
take, he sent the wrong copy from Walcha, and it
commenced: “ It is with feelings of no ordinary
gratification that we welcome again in our midst
Herr H igglebosh, the courteous and talented piano-
forte tuner.” Writing of Stuart Cumberland s
stances, “Stella” says: “Another of the guests
M. Perrin—the manager of the Francaise (sic)
Theatre —hid a pin behind a miniature; M. Ludovic
Halevy, the composer, hid a sou under a pile of
table napkins.” What does this giddy tlutterer
mean by the “ Francaise ” (we pardon her the
absence — probably through Ill-health of the
accent cidtlle) “theatre?” Funny, too, all the
rev. editors and religious “readers” passed this!
The Herald has a fine library, also. Perhars,
however, the French dictionary and the

A Qoulbura poetess, whose sylvan fancy
it is to call herself “ Mimosa,” has once more laid
down the rolling-pin and taken up the lyre. Bhe
has published in one of the local papers a pathetic
poem, which she calls “Sing me a song when I
die.” Who the fortunate person is of whom she
asks this mournful favour is not revealed in the
poem. From the tender insistance of the strain,
however, and these two lines in the second v«- rse,
“ Gather the bells when they blow,
Lay them to die on my tomb,”
we have a shrewd suspicion that he is the town"
bellman. There is a tone of sweetly soft pathos
running all through this little lyric. For instance,
hero is a verse j
“Ah! you will ponder and say,
* Why had the girl such an end ?*
You that have bent to her sway,
Brother, and lover, and friend.”
This Is very pretty and touching—“ You that have
bent to her sway.” But bent to her sway of what?
The broom-handle ? Or the potato-beetle ? We are
not hypercritical enough to say, as a rule, these
things should be more than shadowed out in
poetry; yet It is well, occasionally, to let your
readers know whether they are keeping abreast
of your ideas or not. However, as “ Mimosa ’
asks someone to sing her a song when she dies, we
will contribute a couple of verses towards it, and
the grave-digger can write the rest. Here she has
Jt:—
Sing you a song when you die!
Drop, too, a brick on your bier,
Hiccup above you and sigh—
How you must suffer, poor dear!
Sing you a song when you die I
Fill you with steak and with stew,
Cram you with pudding and pie—
That’s what’s the matter with you 1

Hobby Byrne’s poet must have taken too
(much water In his rum, or something— »r possibly
'they have handed him, by mistake, a boarding-
-house gridiron. His theme, this time, is Jennie
Lee; and it is to those words that he thrumbs the
heefy bars of his Parnassian griddle:—
“ A three-nights’ run they keep
To list to Sam’s gay fun;
But now, alas! we weep,
For Jennie Jee (sic) must run.
“ Heart-exciting Jennie Lee!
By her Jo she made you grieve, man;
Chirped her Grasshopper with glee,
Last, she played the
Ticket-of-Leave Man."
The same stupendous bard writes a song for one
of the Pollard kids, a portion of which runs, musi-
cally, thus :—
“ Samuel cried ‘ Oh, my I ’ and he said likewise,
*Te, he, he I’
As this butcher ran your election cries,
My dear Tom C ”
This kind of thing, we should say, is calculated to
give great pleasure - very great pleasure, Indeed,
to the educated—kanaka. There is too much joy
In it, however, for the prosaic white man. We
engaged a man once, on the strength of a ton of
testimonials and a College degree, and he com-
menced to write this kind of thing directly.
Twenty-four hours later the literary staff were
dnoklsK rum out of his skull.
Why let this poet burst in verse ?
Why give him not the venal sack ?
At least the man could drive a hearse,
And lots there are of boots to black 1
Let no man gaze upon his face
To guage the size of bis small soul.
But hide him in some humid place
Where there are lots of rata—and coal.
And if he’s missed, now understand,
Much hesitation won’t be needed;
Just say he’s gone to Sydney, and
That Sladen has been superseded.

A country paper, speaking of the rain-tree,
Bays it is “ especially useful from the fact that it
produces in abundance pulpy pods, which are a
very fattening fodder for stock, who eat them
with a relish.”—
With amazement we lift up our eyebrows,
And ask “ What’s the Relish they use ?
Is it Morton’s, Maconochle’s, Whybrows,
Or Batty’s, or Colman’s, or whose ?”
We declare nothing could be much odder
Than seeing a cow pass the sauce,
And hearing her say “ On your fodder
Just sprinkle a taste of Red Cross I
“ I myself always use It when / browse
On these most delectable pods;
And, as sensible Stock, I say ‘ Why browse
Without Whybrows’ Relish ?’ ’’-[Yegods I]
This could only have happened in Begs.
A boy down there—who will in all likelihood, grow
up to be a bloated Bega editor, If he is not hanged
-stole two fowls. The lawyer defending him
made a great hit then, by pointing out that in
Section 100 of the Act referred to,the words “or
■bird” after “animal” were omitted, and, that it
was, therefore, impossible to pronounce sentence.
The police magistrate struggled a long time with
the weighty question as to whether a fowl was an
animal. He concluded it was not, and dismissed
the case. That night be lost some of his own
fowls. He is now going to take the law into his
own hands-in the shape of a shotgun loaded with
rock-salt. But he has done one good thing in his
life for the liberty of the Press. He will be re-
membered as a benefactor to journalism rs long as
fowl-soup is necessary to the production of the
higher class of humour. The Shroud staff need
never now be without a pullet in the pot. But be-
fore leaving this pleasant and cheery item, we
should like to know if a fowl is not an anlm >1,
what it is. It couldn’t be a police magistrate ?

The books of a Parisian pawn-shop were
overhauled a short time ago, and among the
articles pawned were found 150 little figures of
Christ. This x-eminds us of a literary Bohemian of
the sld reckless type whom wo knew in Melbourne
years ago. Ho would drink nothing but cham-
pagne cup one day, and tho next day be quite as
happy with his head in a pewter. We may men-
tion he was a devout Roman Catholic, and used to
wear a small crucifix round his neck. On the third
day after tho high tide of his affluence ho would
be stranded on the diy shores of desnord. Then,
If one of us met him and asked him to take a
drink—which we always did, if we “ held it,” being
all poor devils together—he would say, with fears
in his eyes, “Tom”—or Jack, or whatever the
name might bo—“ the end's not far off ; I’ve
pawned my little Jaysus for fipponce.” Poor
devil, he has gone to where many a clever fellow
went long ago. The grass is as green upon his
grave as upon the grave of many a wiser man. It
Is a melancholy pleasure now to think that his
pewter was kept full to the last.
“We went away without a cheer, after,
all," says the Herald humourist who is writing
about the Coral Islands, in referring to the depar-
ture of the vessel from Auckland. We think he
should be astounded at his luck in getting away
with his life. Permit us to call your hushed atten-
tion to this passage in his second contribution:—
“Let me return to our first afternoon out-an
afternoon as fine as ever a landsman could wish,
and the water as smooth as a mill-pond. What a
gathering there was on deck, which was all too
small for the fine-weather company. What rub-
bing of elbows with each other in the press of the
favourite promenade. How glibly the talk flowed
over our afternoon tea. How the eyes of the
ladles sparkled with pleasure when they learned
that afternoon tea was to be one of the recognised
Institutions on board.” Now, we ask you calmly
what is this 1 Is it a boarding-school essay or a
doll-shop advertisement in diguise? What is this
about the water being as smooth as a mill-pond ?
Had it not also a coign of ’vantage, and did it not
at once admit the soft impeachment that it gave
pleasure to all ? We consider this kind of writing
does credit to the writer's head and heart.
Io is a pleasant proof that Doth are toft. Which is
lurther corroborated by a long paragraph about a
baby, that might have been written by the baby it-
self with a pap-spoon dipped in corn-flour. Before
going further, we would like to know who is sup-
posed to care to know that the ladies’ eyes sparkled,
and where the person dwells who is interested in
hearing that there was no baby on boai d. A grown
man, with a beard, we presume, and a gruff voice,
goes several thousand miles away, to places rich in
new experiences, to tell ns about afternoon tea
and a baby I At first reading, we thought this kind
of thing conld only have come from the kettle-
drum and unirie scribe, but the following sentences
enabled us to see, through his thin disguise, the
real produce reporter behindAh! how pleasanf
are the memories of that afternoon. How pleasant
to remember our sharp appetites, and the zest with
which wg looked forward to the ‘tocsin of the
I soul, the dinner-bell!”’ There is genuine feeling
j and true power in this. A man should never go
I out of his element. The writer of these contri-
butions should never go outside the cook’s galley
| for material. He does his best to be versatile, but
I the strain is too much for him. For instance,
here is a mixture of produce repox-ter and soiree
j scribe:—“ Meanwhile we look forward to snatch-
ing some glimpses of consolation from the contem-
plation of the beautiful between meals, and of
worshipping it at a distance.” Contemplation of
: what? Worship of what at a distance? The
ladies? Pshaw I—the meals. All this time there is
little of the language of the sea. We were dis-
appointed that “ yeo, hcavo 0,” “the good ship’’
—we forget her confounded name—“belay there,’’
“Avast,” and such other inspiriting phrases as are
common in the mouths of mariners, were not
used, bat wo were x-ecompensed by “ the cradle of
the deep ” “gliding on an even keel,” and a now
and elegant phrase—which will no doubt be en-
thusiastically adopted by all future writers on
nautical matters—“ she ” (the ship of course)
“squirmed in agonized throes.” Now, however,
for graphic gaiety; now for daring,
drollery. Clench your teeth and hold your sides
as you read this:—“ Put another one on her,’ said
the captain: ‘there’s worse weather coming on.’
Worse! Oh, misery! This was too much. I gro-
velled against the taffrail in despair; and when
they came to carry the stricken and remorseful
below, I was feebly exorcising the trip in some of
the words of Macbeth, ‘Avaunt, and quit my
sight! Too real mockery, hence! Why so?—
being gone I am a man again —on shore.”
Put another what on her? Another mustard
plaster or another blanket ? Remember all this
is printed in the most solemn and serious journal
in the world; a journal that at one time to Jest in
was worse than contempt of court. True, there is
no single separate jest in this Coral Island corres-
pondence—it is all one long hideous practical joke.
Still, to give the writer a fair show, we would
willingly have supposed that ho wrote his letter
when he was sea-sick. The last line of It, how-
ever, supplies a different excuse. Says he: “Our
Sabatical decorum to-morrow will, however,
sober us.” We hope it did. As for us, wild horses
will not drag us from the bowl of oblivion after
this. And we hope that, when we are able to keep
our teeth from chattering and can manage once
more to get along without the aid of a railing, by
that time the special correspondent of the Herald
to the Coral Islands, with his hybrid humour and
his mulish merriment, will be the centre dish on
the groaning board of a Coral Island chief.
There was a Maori jury engaged at Tara-
naki lately. They tried their man, gave their ver-
dict, and sat still in the box. The judge Informed
them, through an interpreter, that they might go
out into the free, glad air. But this did not move
them. They developed an intention to try the
judge, and find him guilty of something. At last,
the c’erk had presence of mind enough to whisper
“whisky” to them, at the same time pointing to
his own room. They were gone like a vision, be-
fore you could express dissatisfaction with your
eyes, if you were so inclined. Whisky is the great
civiliser, and trial by jury is its prophet.

A journal that should wrap packages in
every pawnshop is the Auckland Free Lance.
It is conducted with an eaterprue which would do
credit to any blind mondicint, and make the flnan-
clal fame of any paralytic match-seller. On* of
its devices to gain subscribers might be copied
with advantage by our own 11dm. It give* a prii<«
to the barmaid who gets the most votes for beauty
and popularity from its subscribers. The names
of the barmaids are published with the number of
rotes they get. The “ voting coupon,” as it is
magniloquently denominated, is published la
every paper. So that an adventitious circulation
is gained among the admirers of barmaids. Then
it gives a prize to the person who finds out a text
of Scripture which is printed in one copy out of
every issue. This is a new way of making Holy
Writ popular among the masses. But it rakes in
subscribers from the Sunday-schools. After look-
ing through this lively Journal, we have come to
the conclusion that, if it were not for devices like
these, it would only be read by the mother of the
machine-boy, under the impression—which is pro-
bably a correct one—that he wrote it all himself, or
by the editor in moments of unusual gloom. And
they talk about the power of the Press I The
heading of the coupon column—“ keep this paper
for a week, it may be worth a pound ’’—strikes us
as being too ambiguous to ensnare many snbsori-
bera. The paper is published—heaven knows
how!—every day. The copies for a week would
weigh a pound. Is this it? No one surely could
be weak enough to Imagine that a paper published
upon shut-your-eyes-and-open-your-mouth-and-
see-whut-the-Lord-will-send-you principles could
be worth more than what it fetched by weight, if
kept far a thousand years. No one, that is, but the
editor. And this is what journalism is coming to ?
We may soon expect to see editors giving away
their aunts as prizes to whoever gets the most sub-
scribers for the paper, and publishing coupons for
a raffle for their stepmothers. But there is one
thing we will never see editors of this type raffling
—their brains. Nobody would take a ticket.

Hooke, of the Tamworth Observer, has
what he calls a ‘‘Lucky Barrel.” You would
naturally think this meant the office beer-barrel,
i>n 1 that the man would be lucky who thought he
could find anything in it. So we thought, but it
appears we were wrong. It is a sort of compensa-
tion lottery for those who subscribe to the Ob-
server. What they don’t find in the Observer
they will find in the barrel—so to speak. Yet it
seems that even this ingenious scheme was doomed
to be coffined in its cradle—or rather, barrel. Says
Hooke“ It may be remembered that early in
the year the tickets in the Observer Lucky Barrel
were drawn. Up to date, the prize, a pair of pic-
tures valued at £5, has not been claimed. We
wish the owner of the winning ticket would claim
and take away the prize.” Sad, isn't It ? But of
course there is only one of two conclusions to
come to—either that the pictures were painted by
Hooke himself, or that they are portraits of him,

—with hair like a furze bush and a mouth like a
camel, with the underlip overlapping the chin-
tattooing a song to the sunrise on his shin-bone.

Even a Bishop may become famous. Dr.
Moorhouse has discovered this. It seems his
Lordship, upon one or two unguarded occasions,
spoke tolerantly of the use of tobacco. Hardly
had his words been telegraphed as far as Stawell
(Vic.) when a tobacconist there, whose enterprise
outran his veneration, advertised a particular
species of plug tobacco as “The Bishop's Mix-
ture.” Not content with this, he had the embla-
zoned impudence to paint, in Titanic letters on his
sign-board, “ Under the distinguished patronage
of the Right Reverend James Moorhouse, Bishop
of Melbourne.” We tremble as we give this Infor-
mation. Why, think you ? Because we expect to
see, next week, half-a-dozen suburban whisky-
saloons with the sign: “Under the venerable
patronage of Bishop Barry.”

A gentle Romeo writes in the Bubkowa
Times, a poem to his Juliet, with which we have
no fault to find. We only refer to it to admire.
Here is a verse we admire:—
“ Oh, darling! Kindly listen, love ?
I love you more than life,
Just answer with a flavoured kiss
For yes! And be my wife.”
Just so. We have all been that way. It Is ft
beautiful, emotional error which is subsequently
corrected by the fire-shovel. Still, why a “flavour-
ed kiss?” Flavoured with what? Cheese? Onions?
But, of course—it is a Burrowa maiden of whom
the poet speaks—with whisky. Love is the reai
fiery thing in Burrowa. When a man Is building
a store up there, he puts spikes in the verandah-
posts to keep off lovers. He is alrald of them set-
ting fire to the building, with their incendiary
sighs. This is the sort of lova Catullus sang about.
Catullus was a fire-insurance agent.

Never bury your talent—or your tea, for
that maf ter. A young immigrant lady was hired
to do kitchen work in a Herberton hotel, a few
weeks ago. The elderly kitchen lady, who superin-
tended the dripping department, became Jealous
of her, and concocted a plan for her destruotloft -
that is to say, dismissal. But the good old lady was
caught in the act discovered taking tea from ft
chest and burying It under a bush. Nothing wal

however, until she came to the lady of the
hotel (there are no women in Herberton) and told
her that she was being robbed by the young lady
from across the Jasper sea, and to go look at the
tea-chest. The tea had been replaced, in the mean-
time, by those who had watched the guilty deed;
and when the lady of the hotel opened the chest,
she found the contents at the usual level, and so
pointing her finger at the lady of the kitchen,
she said, as Nathan did unto David, “Thou
art the manl” That she was not the man
mattered very little then to the lady of the
lard-barrel, as she had to suddenly pack up her
hamper and depart from the place where the
gloom of her glory o’ershadowed the dough-
trough. Now, you will probably ask, and with
some reason, too, what the purgatorial fires all
this has to do with you. Well, it contains a moral,
and a moral is good to anybody who can exchange
it for a match. The moral is when you do any-
thing which public opinion considers improper

pender has Often been enough to hang many a pro-
mising murderer. If the respectable old lady of
this legend had, Instead of burying the tea, given
it away to a swagman, or sold it to a hawker, she
would have oocured for herself either a harp and
halo to the happy hereafter, or several half-crowns
n the struggling present, and still kept her control
,of the cooking stove. But, as the old Persian pro-
verb says, no man knows he is dead till the devil is
at his door.
We are line fellows, we Australians, and
more determined characters than we had any Idea
of, London Vanity Fair knows us well, and we
learn from It that “ The Australian Colonistpare

ally, that If the French insist on sending their
criminals to the islands adjacent to Australia, and
if those criminals should land in any numbers in

New Caledonia, or on any of the islands whence
they immediately came — but on the coast of
Normandy.”
Among the arguments of Henry George
not many cut deeper, or were more energetically
pooh-poohed and controverted, than his demon-
stration that when private ownership of land of a
country was permitted in few bands, the bulk of
the people of that country existed in it on suf-
ferance, and had no legal right to stand anywhere
but oa the highways. Landlords and their sy mpa-
thUers sneer at such talk, and probably no one
would deny the truth of it more strenuously than
the Forfarshire Tory laird who refused a good
offer to rent a farm simply because the tenant pro-
posing to rent it was a Liberal,
It is difficult to comprehend Mr. Glad-
stone's ideas with respect to Egypt and the Soudan.
Alter crushing the Egyptian endeavours at national
freedom, he stated in the House of Commons, with
respect to the Soudanese, that a war against them
would be “a war of conquest against a people
struggling —rightfully struggling —to be free.”
Vanity Fair very appositely asks: “ What busi-
ness bad he, then, to sanction General Graham's
expedition? 'i he six thousand Soudanese who
were shot down by Graham’s troops were right-
fully struggling for freedom. Their lives were
sacrificed for no intelllgib e purpose. How does
Mr. Gladstone justify the sacrifice ?”
In England B. T. Jones and J. Finney,
the celebrated swimmers, recently swam a quarter
of a mile in the lake at Roundbay Park, near
Leeds, fer £100. The match caused great excite-
ment in the North of England, no less than 30,000
people witnessing the match. A level start was
effected, both men striking the water slmulta-
taneously, and for the first 15 yards they kept
close together. After this, however. Jones com-
menced to draw away, and at 220 yards was fully
29 yards in advance. The leader after this took
matters very easily, and finally won by about 25
yards in Cmin. 54sec. Both men have reached the
highest position in the swimming world, but for
some time past it was thought that Jones, who Is
now 34 years of age, had retired on his laurels.

The nation of soldiers which Colonel Sar-
good’s military scheme proposes to manufacture
does not command a lofty respect from Mr. D.
M. Davies. That gentleman, in his place in the
House, recently, observed that he believed the
object of the scheme was principally to please per-
sons who liked to appear in fine colours and wear
a sword. Anyone who knows or has heard on
fairly reliable authority how many confounded
fools there are to the thousand in every country,
will admit it to be very likely that the ambition
of a fine lot of the rank and file in Victoria is not
so much to blow the brains out of an enemy, as to
earn the renown of being the pretty boys of the
parapets. Still, the subject can't be kicked out
with that. Colonel Sargood can say, as indeed he
did say a few days before at Maldon, that the
amount of bullion alone in the Melbourne Banks
being never under £3,000,000, a looting expedition
becomes a probability the moment Great Britain
gets involved with a stron«|oower. The difficulty
would seem to lie in cyphering out how much a
colony should spend on procuring and maintaining
a force to stand around and protect, on a given
occasion, a given sum of money.
Sergeant Scott and Senior-constable Ma-
guire, of the Fitzroy, (Vic) police foorce, have
each been fined £5 for giving a good “ karracther”
to Mr. Potter, a shady kind ol individual who
applied for a license for a hotel in Carlton, when it
was well-known to those shining lights of the con-
stabulary that Mr. Potter combined a maximum
of the wisdom of the serpent wiih a minimum of
the harmlessness of the dove. At all events, his
dealings with the soiled doves of Carlton had
brought him into a kind of notoriety, so he applied
to the heads of the “foorce” in Fitzroy to white-
wash him, which they did accordingly. The usual
Star Chamber Inquiry has been held by the police
department, with the above result, and the pair of
“indefatigable officers” are still retained in the
ranks. The head and front of the notorious Sam
Nathan’s offending, in harbouring and supplying
the demi-monde at Emerald Hill, was his ill-timed
boast that he could “square the police anytime
for a £5 note.” And there is little doubt but that
it would have gone a long way towards it in most
cases. It is a well-known fact that there are a
number of hotels within a radius of one hun-
dred yards of the intersection of Bourke and
Swanston streets, that are simply the com-
mon resort of the giddiest of females and their
dissolute companions, and we have never heard a
word against the licenses of these places being
granted, though the conduct of the houses re-
ferred to was as well known (if not better) to the
police as to any person in Melbourne. Though the
sub-inspector who attends to the licenses does not
actually give the applicants in these cases “ kar-
racthers,” yet his silence implies that they are, if
not absolutely beyond suspicion, at least highly
desirable persons to hold licenses. We have re-
peatedly seen the proprietor of the Bull and Mouth
hauled up and fined for supplying a customer
with a glass of beer after hours, while the licensees
of the resorts of the giddy and frivolous wore kept
open until “all hours,” and the indefatigable
bobby would walk steadily along on the opposite
side of the street. While thi* sort of thing goes
on openly, and ander the eyes of the high-salaried
officials of the department, we suppose that the
underlings of Fitzroy consider themselves justified
in doing a good turn to a generous-hearted publi-
can on their own account.
Alas! for the weakness of poor frail human
nature. It is just as we feared. Granny is “on
the pot” once morel And she so young, so fairl
It may be, however, that she is only suffering from
religious mania. It is not for us to iudge her case,
unless we are duly elected by the Church of Eng-
land Synod. The fact, however, remains that of
late the old lady’s advertising co’umns have con-
tained communications which would bring a blush
to the cheek of a boiled lobster. A few weeks «go,
the ancient reprobate announced the demise of an
imaginary Celestial who rejoiced, whilst alive, in
the possession of a remarkably high-sounding
name, and who, according to groggy old Granny's
account, was to be buried “at 12 in the afternoon,”
the funeral to move from his late re>idence, which
was graphically described as being situated in
“ North Sydney.” Shortly after this, an announce-
ment touching the very domesticated nature of a
certain barmaid’s desires was (unintentionally, we
trus ) made public in terms which laid our giddy
maternal relative liable to be hauled up under t e
Obscene Publications Act. Last week we noticed
with pleasure that although the unfortunate old
lady’s remarks were as drunken as ever, still there
was a decided improvement as regards the r moral
tone, For example. Recently she hiccuped the
loss of a dead dinge as follows: "Jiost, from 49
Ed ward-street North, black tanned setter dog, an-
swers to Jack. Finder rewarded.” We presume
the dog is dead, because it ia scarcely probable that
anyone would tan a live setter, and, this being the
case, how, in thunder, can he answer when Jack
calls him ? Anyway, who is Jack ? Where is Jack ?
And what in the name of sulphur does he want a
tanned dog for? Being an ardent lover of pefs,
the unfortunate straying away of the deceased
setter must have sent Granny on the “JamberodJ*
again, for we read: “ Redfern Police Court. Mb.
O’Malley Clarke, 8.M., presided at the above Court,
yesterday, and disposed of the business. Chariot
Blackburn, for committing a similar offence 1b
Botany-road, Botany, was fined £3, in default one
month’s imprisonment.” This is the saddest ease
of all, for it proves that either the old lady is re-
velling in a whooping tear again, or else there is
one law for the rich and another for the poor; be-
cause, if Mr. O’Malley Clarke was allowed to “ pre-
side, &c,” and subsequently clear off scot free, why
should Charles Blackburn bo fined £3 for commit-
ting “a similar offem-e?” Eheu! And it was only
i he other day poor Granny donned her little bit
of blue.
It is with a genuine, heart-felt thrill of
joy that we learn the satisfactory news that the
raising of double-yoked children (if we may be
allowed to coin a word) is now being carried out
on a far more satisfactory principle than It ever
was before. Not that we hanker after being the
Eroud possessors of ten or twelve youngsters
itched together in pairs, because such “ things of
beauty and joys for ever ’’ are not suitable for
every family; but, nevertheless, there are some
enterprising parents who are evidently filled with
a praiseworthy desire to strike out of the old-
fashioned groove, and experimentalise for them-
selves in the almost untrodden regions of the groat
lusus naturae. We wish these persons every suc-
cess in their new venture; in fact, we even wish
them more good mck than wo could possibly wish
ourselves, if we happened to be in the same busi-
ness. This, of course, is not a verv patriotic re-
mark; but it is the truth, for all that, and, as a
certain senator says, truth should never be sacri-
fleed for patriotism—unless it pays better to work
the latter. We are naturally led into this train of
thought to-day by the knowledge of the fact that
the on ,i« celebrated Siamese twins have been com-
pletely laid out straight by two brothers who were
recently born at Turin of the usual number of
poor but respectable parents. These interesting
young paregoric punishers hav<%two well-formed
heads, two pairs of arms, two throats with all in-
ternal organs, but at the level of the sixth rib they
coalesce into one body. It is a curious fact that
the right leg moves under the direction of the
right twin (Baptiste), while the other is moveable
only by the other (Jacon). They have a distinct
moral personality-one laughs while the other
cries, and so on. It was in this latter respect that
the ar.hitects of the late Messrs. Chang and Rng
completely failed. Each one had a very d'stlnct
moral personality, indeed; but where the mistake
was made was in the fact that Chang could net
only work his own end of the legs, but, being
stronger than Eng, he could perform with that
young gentleman’s locomotive apparatus also.
This used to lead up to no end of trouble. In the
case of Baptiste and Jacob, however, the physical
forces are equalized, and one can, therefore, act aa
a brake, so to speak, on the other. Whilst we are
on this subject to-day, we may also mention that
Italy appears to be going it at present in the way
of novelties, aa a man with three arms turned up
in Calabria. That's exactly the styl* of immigrant
that we want out here to-day. Two-armed galoots
were well enough in their way, before the intro-
duction of chaff-cutters and trains, but now that
our steam machinery is in full blast over here, a
corresponding changein the human anatomy is, of
course, most urgently needed. Mr. Stuart might
make a note of ting matter.

rnmr to ihe colony at the suggestion of the Duchess that a Government billet might be secured for him—or, if the worst came to the worst, an interviewership on the D.T.

£„i„„cnrthy is about to sing for the entertainment of the brilliant company which the Duchess of Darlinghurst has brought together expressly to meet her second cousin
(t h econversa firmflagging a little on account of the noisy prelude), asks the following connundrum: “ What is the difference between a Mechanic who repairs

The comoany being very select, no one will have anything to do with a conundrum with a mechanic in it, except the second cousin, who remembers that Mr. Fitzroy Fizzle-

ful or two out of his whiskers, and throws his spectacles into the fire. Everybody present, and a good many others who were not invited, and for whom there would not

Just think! The Good Tem

vote that a man may belong to the
order and yet carry on the business
of a publican. At this rate, we
ourselves may soon hope to be
eligible for admission to the order:
and who knows but in time we may
be appointed to the Grand Decan-
tership, or something equally im-

Then the gallant sergeant shifted
uneasily in his seat, and, under
cover of a stentorian cry of “Soll-
encel” surreptitiously shifted his
handkerchief from the pocket
nearest to the reporter’s-hox to the
pocket nearest the bench. “It was
given to me,” he said, afterwards,
apologetically, to the Inspector.

me to provide it with a lightning

God likes to destroy bis own pro-

The Melbourne Footmen’s Delight, In
speaking of Miss Pigdon’s wedding, states that it
w&« a “ very quiet affair.” This comes of the other
“Society” chronicler collaring the turkey and

could get down into the cloak-room and plant
them under hia ulster. It don’t amount to much
only to carry away a jelly in your hat!
A contemporary says that there is a
woman in Tasmania who has one blue eye and one
brown one. This ia not so much of a wonderful
t ling. There is a woman In the next yard to us
who has, frequently, a blue and a black one, and,
sometimes, both her eyes are black. But that is
only when her husband comes home unusually
late and finds that she has removed the keyhole.
Funny, this. When the blackfellows came
for their usual annual allowance of clothing to
the Grafton police station, three of them were seen
shortly after marching about the streets with
constables’ helmets on their heads. This fact is a
silent but convincing proof of the depths of de-
gradation to which the aboriginal races have
fallen. They are not even ashamed to run the
risk of being taken for policemen.
This is a cheerful horoscope. A temper
ance paper gives the career of the young men who
have learnt to drink, in these words:—“ First, a
cigarette; second, a cigar; third, a glass of beer to
coel the mouth, and tnroat; fourth, a glass of
whisky to settle the unsteady nerves; fifth, drunk;
sixth, a loafer; seventh, the gutter; eighth, the
5 rave.” But, what of ninth ? Ninth, a voter for
ohn Davies. Let us all resolve to die at fifth.
There are some good-sized hares in Vic-
toria. At a place called Tarnagulla—so the near-
est local paper says—the hares have been known
to chase horses. We have no doubt—if the horses
belonged to the editor. We have seen some
editorial horses, and we think if we had the choice
we would rather ride on a hare. Yet we have seen
these same horses display, at times, a courage
bordering on ferocity. This was when they got
near a hay-store.
If one were asked to define Nothing, one
might make a worse attempt than this: “ An hono-
rary captaincy, unattached, without pay in the Per-
manent Household Brigade.” Yet such is Gus’s new
dignity, with which, if his ambition be satisfied,
we should say his ambition was a feather-weight.
The only wonder is he wasn’t gazetted a Field-
Marshal ; ’twould have cost no more, and in sub-

lt is sometimes advisable not to bring a
child up too much on the bottle. This was proved
by a lady living in Tullarook (Vic.), who had occa-
sion to get drunk in Seymour lately. She took her
child—aged twelve months—with her, and hilari-
ously returned without it. Next day it was found
dead on the road. We wonder, now, if she would
have lost it if it had been a keg of rum. But per-
haps it was all for the better. The child might
have grown up and taken to drink, and disgraced
her.
They say that a ton of literature is daily
added to stock in the British Museum. Very solid
reading, we should imagine. And yet there can
hardly be any copies of the Herald there. Speak-
ing of the Herald, we heard that the first sen-
tence of the letter from the New Caledonia corres-
pondent fell out of the “ galley,” the other day,
and killed two compositors. We wonder it did not
drive them through the floor. It was heavy
enough to crush its readers afterwards, at all
events.
They were two Israelites, and they had
come down early to the market to get a bit of
cheap fish. The fish is, as you know, in heaps of
two or more, according to the size and character
of it. Glancing askance at the new-comers, the
indefatigable Seymour said, “Now, all the schnap-
ps's gone; what shall we say for these two poor
little jews?” Next moment, the heap was
knocked down for 3s. 8d. to “Constantinople.”
while the two Hebraic strangers hurried away in
the direction of Alberto Terrace.
The paralyser about the Fijian native
policeman, who is going to get a gold medal for
swimming from a wreck with a child on each
arm and the mother on his back, is still travelling
through the country papers. We have wondered
every time we have road it what he would have
done with a third child if there had been one
Perhaps he would have put it in his mouth. But
this is improbable, as then he would most likely
have been drowned in going in to fetch it. Great-
ness in our own force runs to feet; in the Fijian it
runs to moutu.
WONDERS OF THE AGE.
Whyi. it so many people are never satisfied ?
Their homes are marvels of comfort and luxury,
friends are generous and affectionate ; they are
educated and refined, capable, not only of enjoy-
ing, but of imparting happiness to others: yet
they are dissatisfied, miserable, and, really without
intending to do so, make others miserable. Their
blood is impure, they have taken a heavy cold, or
they are bilious. A few doses of Bmll Frese’s
Hamburg Tea would remove all obstructions, and
enable them to enjoy, with renewed zest, the plea-
sures they are now compelled to forego.
FOR THE GUIDANCE OF OTHERS.
Glenmore Road, Paddington,
„ _ 14th January, 1884.
Gentlemen,—Some few weeks since I was so
severely affected with Indigestion as to render my
rising each morning a matter of difficulty and
pain on account of severe pains in the back; and
it had just become necessary for me to take a holi-
day from my work, for the performance of which
1 was by no means fit, when a friend mentioned to
me the benefit he derived from the use of Ham-
burg Tea. In the hope of getting some relief, I
used it myself, the result being that I was myself
m three or four days, and have not suffered since.
My friends have advised me to write this for the
guidance of others, and you arc at liberty to make
what use you please of this.

Political Points
The Giraffe complains that the depart-
mental clerk, in concocting’ answers to Parlia-
mentary questions, fixes up a statement that does
not cover the whole truth. Others, long before
the Giraffe’s neck had reached its present altitude,
had made the same complaint. ’Tis not the clerk s
fault. Rather ’tis his virtue to be so responsive to
the essentiai principle of the system of which he
is a portion. The public office system is based on
procrastination, circumlocution, pigeon-holing,
shelving, making the worse appear the better by
an ingeniously disingenuous use of statistics, j
avoiding the point, telling half truths, memo.-ing
on turned-down folios, having-the-honour-to-be,
and so on; and a man has no more reason to wonder
that a fellow-creature who has been passed through
it should turn out a fixer-up of statements that do
not cover the whole truth, than that a girl
passed through the fashionable boarding-school
fwith extras ad infinitum) should turn out a
fribble.
Five hours was a big spin for the little
man of Collingwood to rake in the Victorian
Assembly the other night. When he stood up
there was a portentous look in his eyes, and the
posture of his legs indicated rigidity of muscle
and very high heels to his boots. For a while it
seemed as if something lying on the floor of the
House had entitled itself to the favour of his
glances, but gradually he drew them off and dis-
pensed them liberally on certain quartern ot the
Speaker’s Gallery. Why, such charges of fire and
disdainful indignation should be shot thither was
at first not very plain. But it soon came to be
perceived that the orator was only practising. A
tack in the floor had curled up—an aged party in
the gallery had left with a trot—and with these
proofs before him of the first-rate condition of his
withering-up faculties, the little man folded his
arms, and turning lull upon the Ministerial
Denches, volleyed into the lace of the Chief-
Secretary. It was for this he had been getting
ready all the time. And although the period
has not arrived in which James Mirams
can command the assent of the House to all
his opinions, his voice had a good deal of the
ring of a leader's in it when, shaking himself free
from the restraints of a sham allegiance, he de-
clared : “Liberals were led to believe that Mr.
Berry agreed with the Reform League. It turns
oat that he did not. He went with the League
only to humbug the people. The exigencies of
his career rendered it necessary for him to get a
party somewhere, and as he could not humbug
the Conservatives he humbugged the Liberals.”
Almost the same words appeared in these pages in
the good old times when Major Smith and the de-
light of Collingwood were playing the game of the
two little brothers of the great man.
Whether it is due to any impetus imparted
by the lecturing tour of Henry George, or
whether merely the natural outgrowth of circum-
stances, we know not, but we perceive from
Home papers that the principles of the Scottish
Land League are taking strong hold in that coun-
try and making extensive strides. In Glasgow,
Greenock, Aberdeen, and Dundee there are
powerful centres of organization -the artlzan class
being, as usual in all countries, the quickest to
comprehend the significance of a political griev-
ance and of a corrective system. From these centres
the propaganda are extending with enormous
rapidity and comprehensiveness over the rural
districts, and of course find readiest adherents
where landlords’ exac. ions have been most severely
exercised; which is generally in districts remote
from political centres and from universal observa-
tion. Thus, in Scotland the Land League is full of
vitality, especially at the nerve centres and at the
extremities. Landlords have taken the alarm,
only to intensify the trouble. In lieu of recogniz-
ing the absolute necessity of gradual submission,
they are cursed, like Pharoah, and harden their
hearts, refusing to let the people go. The conse-
quence of this attitude has been that a promising
organization, the Highland Land Law Reform As-
sociation, with a very moderate programme,
in which many men of Conservative Instincts
had busied themselves, has been practically
shouldered out of the way by a much more
radical body — the Scottish Land Restoration
League. This League adopts in its essentials the
programme of Henry George, and derides the
tentative proposals of the Reform Association.
Captain Campbell, one of the Highland Land Law
Reform Association deputation which waited upon
the Lord Advocate, lately, in connection with the
threatened evictions in Bkye, told that gentleman
that since the advent of the Restoration League in
Skye the more moderate association which he re-
presented had lost very much of its influence
amongst the islanders. And the same must inevit-
ably be the outcome everywhere that the land-
lords reply to demands for just concessions by
threats of cruelty, oppression, and violence. “ Land
Restoration League” is a good title. Our “brither
Scots ” are shrewd customers. While Landlordism
and Plutocracy bellow about “ Confiscation,” they
have “Restoration” for countersign. “Hey for
the Bonnets o’ Blue!” say we.
The nice quiet way in which Russia gulps
down a bit of territory here and there, whenever
the Western Powers of Europe are fully engaged
in some other direction, is quite creditable to the
diplomats of that nation. They steal with more
talent and dexterity and with less disturbance
than any other European nation, while at the same
time they preserve a decent front of cynical
effrontery. When France steals a province from
unlucky barbarians, she generally makes some
sort of transparently frivolous pretence of neces-
sity or affront. But she very seldom does more
than make a grimace of it, and is at no pains to
disguise that it is a mere polite concession to the
decencies of international humbug. Germany is
more matter-of-fact. When she wanted the
Schleswig-Holstein provinces, she raised up a
mystification of claims, so involve! and abstmse
that all the Chancellories and Foreign Offices in
Europe were still puzzling and wrangling over the
questions Involved, while the territory was being
invaded and firmly grabbed. The diplomatic
question, Indeed, was extinguished by accom-
plished tacts, belore any two experts could agree
about the rights and wrongs of the dispute. The
German method, in fact, was highly practical. It
was to begin by determining what to steal and
how to steal it, organize victory, chuck out a
protocolor so for diplomats to occupy themselves
with, and do the burglarising white the inter-
national police were deliberating whether the
enterprise was a burglary or a recovery of stolen
goods. Our own country invariably combines the
maximum of fuss with the climax of hypocrisy.
We invite all the world to observe that
we are about to befriend our poor suffering
acquaintance over the way, and when our poor
suffering acquaintance resists with desperation
our method of relieving him, which generally is
sitting upon him and scooping his pockets, we
proceed to cut his throat before the eyes of ail the
neighbourhood, protesting all the time that what
we meant was to perform a sacred duty, and that
if the victim hadn’t resisted our good offices, we
should not have been under the hard necessity of
shedding his blood. And then we weep, and refer
to our previous good character—although it isn’t
good—and display our celebrated moral pocket-
handkerchief, the Bible, upon a profuse fluttering
of which, on all occasions—although we never
really use the article—we chiefly base our claim to
be regarded as a clean-nosed nation. The Russians,
we commenced by remarking, have a slippy style
of stealing while all Europe is looking another
way. Their latest appropriations were got in this
fashion. Merv is one. Another is Serakhs, a
province of Persia. Upon the whole, the people of
Serakhs will probably be not much worse off as
Russian subjects than they were as vassals of His
Highness the Shah- The Shah, in fact, Is an even
greater potentate than the Czar. Some years ago,
but in the present Shah’s reign, there was a famine
in one district, and he immediately taxed the bread.
There was a very mild riot of starving wretches in
consequence, whereupon he sent an order to the
officials to collect several sack-loads of eyes, which
was done, as blindness must check the most ener-
getic insurgent. He also invented a new punish-
ment for political offenders, viz., that their teeth
should be extracted one by one and hammered
into their skulls. Turcoman captives are nailed
up alive, like rats against a barn wall. About
twenty years ago, a Persian Ambassador at St.
Petersburg ordered one of his servants to be flayed
alive. The Russian authorities interfered, and
said It could not be done in Russia, whereupon the
Ambassador ordered the servant to be nailed up in
a box, and thus conveyed to Persia where it was to
be carried out.
The Scotch crofters continue their most
inconvenient conduct. We call It inconvenient
because it has broken up the dodge of pretending
that the attitude of the Irish in relation to their
landlords was singularly monstrous, and attribut-
able to an innate savagery and brutality in the
Irish nature, and to the fact that the Irish are
mostly “ Papists.” The Skye crofters are, most
unfortunately for that theory, mostly of Scandi-
navian origin, and Presbyterians and Baptists;
and those insolent people, English Radicals, now
pretend that the altitude of the Scotch crofters
endorses their early argument—that it was not the
race or religion of the people, but the Intolerable
nature of the treatment they received, which had
stung the tenants in Ireland to the verge of
revolt; and that people of any race and re-
ligion would be just as “troublesome,” if sub-
iected to the same Injustices. We learn from
jIjOyd’s WKEKiiY that some exciting work is ex-
pected in Skye before long. The landlords, headed
by the Duke of Argylo—who had the cheek to
publish a reply to Henry George in the Nine-
teenth Century, as though he were, like George,
a disintereted reasoner—have attempted to meet
remonstrance by severity, and the process, so
familiar to the Irish, of nu i erous evictions is
threatened. The Scotch peasants are no more in-
timidated by these threats, and no less exasperated,
than the Irish were. The ‘clargy” are siding
with their flocks, and at a meetimr in April in a
church the insolent peasants actually arranged to
Invite a Scotch member for an Irish county pre-
sumably well accustomed to resist oppressive
methods—to contest the county of Argyle against
Lord Colin Campbell, son of the Duke—God bless
him! This instance of the nefarious influence
exercised by the minions of the Scarlet Woman,
and of the blindness of our forefathers in tolerat-
ing the practices of the “ whure o’ Babylon” in a
Protestant nation—but we forget: it was a Baptist
Church the meeting was held in, and the villains
were Protestants to a man. However, to resume,
there was another meeting at Stalfin Bay, in April,
when the proposed ejections were discussed, and
one speaker was applauded when he declared:
“ We are in possession, and we mean to keep pos-
session until driven out at the bayonet point ’’ This
opens up a difficult subject. Whose bayonet points
can be trusted to prick these sturdy Scotchmen ?
In Ireland, the Highland regiments co ild be em-
ployed, all right. But it seems tery dubious
whether Highlanders’ bayonets coula be trusted
against Highlanders and Islanders. Scotch troops
might fraternize with Scotch peasants—their bro-
thers. Then Irish regiments would certainly he out
of the question. Ah Irishman are so schooled now
in the principles of agrarian justice, and so thor-
oughly in sympathy with resistance to oppression
and eviction, that to set a detachment of Irishmen
to enforce a series of evictions, would be a hope-
less absurdity. Some of toe English battalions
would be required, and a pretty blunder it would
be to employ English soldiers against Scotchmen
in Scotland. Why,Scotch boys were, within our
owu experience, taught the History of Scotland,
and that line of education does not tend to incul-
cate unquestioning love of the sister nation, you
cau take our worn. Boys play “ Scotch and Eng-
lish ” in Scotland, just as English boys play ” French
anl English,” and asentiment of national jealousy
is fostered by these apparent trifles. Turn Eng-
lish troops loose on Scotch peasants, and see what
the result would be. Two-thirds; of Scotland
would flare up like gunpowder. The most
convenient dodge would be to send along
a draft of English privates from the vari-
ous Highland regiments, most of which have
a large proportion of English and Irish in their
ranks. The national dress would disguise the real
fact, and probably avert a tremendous agitation.
By and bye, even the English plebs will under-
stand that the agrarian trouble is their affair quite
as much as It is Irish or Scotch. And then there
will be no trustworthy troops to enforce evictions.
The landlord, i.c., the governing, class will then
have to import Qhoorka battalions for these
duties, we suppose. Troops will be necessary in
Skye, we are told, because “ the people have a
thorough contempt for the police, and a corre-
spondent in the Island writes that, however large
the force that might be sent, a bloody comoat will
be the result.”

Derby doesn’t think that to give white
residents of Fiji legislative powers would promote
Fijian interests. He ii right; although, at the
same time, precious little can be said for the Crown
colony system —Uosebery has obtained appoint-
ment of a committee to inquire how the efficacy
of the Lords may be promoted. Granville’s idea
was life peerages, but his House wouldn’t hear of
it. Our idea is that the only way to promote their
efficacy is to wipe them out ... We thought Rose-
bery had more sense than to suggest such a pre-
posterous motion as the representation of the
colonies in the “ Lords.”
The Bad and Worthless
are never imitated or counterfeited. This is es-
pecially true of a family medicine, and it is positive
proof that the remedy imitated is of tha highest
value. As soon as it had been tested and proved
by the whole world that Hop Bitters was the pur-
est, best and most valuable family medicine on
earth, many imitations sprung up and began to
steal the notices in which the press and the people
of the country had expressed the merits of H. B.,
and in every way trying to induce suffering in-
valids to use their stuff instead, expecting to make
money on the credit and good name of H. B.
Many others started nostrums put up in similar
style to H. B., with variously devised names in
which the word “ Hop ” or “ Hops ” were used in
a way to induce people to believe they were the
same as Hop Bitters. All such pretended remedies
or cures, no matter what their style or name is,
and especially those with the word “ Hop ” or
‘ Hops ” in their name or in any way connected
with them or their name, are imitations or counter-
feits. Beware of them. Touch none of them. Use
nothing but genuine American Mop Bitters, with
a bunch or olusier of green Hops on the white
label, and Dr. Soule’s name blown in the glass.
Trust nothing else. Druggists and Chemists are
warned against dealing in imitations or counter-
feits.
Don’t use stimulants, but nature’s brain
an d nerve food—Hop Bitters. See.

The Babes in the Wood.
Three brain-weary parties resolve to
camp out, and meet to make up a list
of provisions, &c.
All they can think of are onions and
whisky—O yes, and a tent. Almost
forgot that.
Must also have an old suit of clothes.
Wife can easily sew patches on only
pair of trousers.
Also, an old
hat. Buy a
new one, and
maltreat it.
The Start. Weather, anything but promising—never mind.
Van-man Instructed to drive them to some out-of-the-way
place.
They find a spot far from the busy haunts of man, and pitch
their tent.
B. begins his sports by
shooting at a bird of
some sort. Weather
still unpromising.
Gun rather rusty—
recoils, and drives
B. into the ground.
Bird yet to be heard
from.
A. catches a fish quite
by accident. A. and
fish, about equally
astonished.
Could not have found a better place. A. will
fish; D. will sketch; B. will shoot. Pic-
turesque lake—plenty of fish and game
evidently.
(Weather less promising than ever.)
D. paints away with such enthusiasm
that he heeds not the rising of the
lake.
Diagram, showing interior of tent, with arrangement
of bunks.
Having Worked hard the first day, they resolve to
take the hext more easily. A walk by the sea—
(just thte thing.
They come upon a ship that has been beached the
night before. They take pity on the captain,
whom they find in tears* and lend him a hand.
Returning from their walk, they
meet a procession of soldier ants
walking off with their stores.
Weather becomes boisterous, and the tent is
blown away, spite of all their combined efforts.
Consultation. “No stores, no tent.
If we remain here longer, we may
starve, and get wet. Perhaps, we
had better go home.”
Carried—(the proposition to go, not
the campers. They had to carry
everything themselves). As they
neared town, weather cleared off
beautifully.

From Albury, we learn, that two distin-
guished foreigners, Mons. Victor and Signor Pietro
dl Ablllis (pass'the pewter), are to fence with foils
In about three weeks’ time.
The imported greyhound puppy, Lady
Hampden, the property of Corrigwn, the steeple-
chase rider, was poisoned by strychnine at Essen-
don whilst at exercise. Corrigan recently refused
£150 for her.
Poor old England! Largan has issued a
challenge to scull any man in England over the re-
cognised champion course for £101 aside. How
many men can we raise in Australia able to put
Largan through? We daresay Laycook, Beach,
Clifford, and Trickett are able to do the trick.
In last week’s issue, the name of “Mat”
Matterson by some means crept in under the por-
trait of the promising young Clarence Elver
sculler. It is scarcely necessary to inform our
readers that the portrait is that of “ Neil ” of that
ilk. However, we thought it better to put this in,
if only to put straight the papers which may copy
the paragraph.
The Australian Eleven pulled themselves
out of the fire by the win over the Gentlemen of
England, with 44 runs to spare. The English
papers were beginning to think W. G. Grace was
“ going off,” but his play against the Australians
showed no proof of it. His highest in both in-
nings, 107 and 30, does not look as if he is going to
give up the title of champion without a struggle.
The English horse, Baroaldine, had lately
become so savage that there was a difficulty in
putting mares to him, but the removal of a decayed
molar has had the effect of reducing him to perfect
a' tude. The operation was performed by
er, a noted German dentist and horse tamer,
who is now resident at Newmarket. He is reported
to have had great success in dealing with horses
Buffering from bad teeth.
At Adaminaby, a rather lively scene took
place on the night of the 16th June, which rather
made up for the slow day’s horse racing. The
Cooma Express says, in connection with the race
between Ranger and Get Back, “ wagers before and
after the race, to the extent of from £30 to £500,
were freely offered by sports with scarcely a
scent to their names.” The italics arc ours, and
the Express man is wrong. The “sports” in
question were in very bad odour by the time they
left Adaminaby.
Says “Augur”: “The most exciting de-
monstration I ever saw made by the fair sex was
at Wagga, when Mr. Tait’s colt Melbourne won,
and it was so genuine that when a deputation of
ladies demanded Mr. Tait’s jacket and cap, and
tore them up to wear upon thoir breasts, the
veteran sportsman was so overcome that tears
rolled down his cheeks.” Thanks “Augur” for
putting us straight. Until you enlightened us, we
always imagined “ Honest John ” wept over such a
waste of good silk.
Messrs. Alcook and Co., the billiard-table
manufacturers, have offered one of their best
billiard-match tables, value 150 guineas, to bo
played for during the Caulfield Cup week, in order
to test the capabilities of colonial billiardists. The
contest is to be open to all comers who have re-
sided in the colonies during the twelve months
prior to the match. Each player is to stake £50,
and the winner is to take the sweep and table. If
mere than two compete the runner-up will receive
a cup value £35 and £35 cash.
The Canterbury Park Race Club held a
most successful race meeting on Saturday last.
Weather perfect, and attendance fully 6000.
Emilius carried off the Birthday Gift by half a
length from Storm, Hvpatia third. Stella made
rather an easy thing of the Selling Race, Godiva
second, Hawthornden third. The Grand Stand Han-
dicap fell to Desmond, Regret second, Espeigle
third. Friendship made an easy win of the Coro-
nation Handicap from Mioreme, Velox third. The
Prince of Wales Stakes fell to Parole, Black Bess
second, Lydia third; and the day’s sport concluded
with the Queen’s Prize, which was won by Bos-
cawen, Palarenda (five lengths away) second,
Godiva third.
lu England, Mr. T. Gee, owner of the
phenomenal horse Peter and other cracks, died a
short time since. He was for some years butler to
a family consisting of two wealthy maiden ladles,
and, having saved up enough money, he gave
notice that he was going to leave their service.
They were dismayed at the idea, and, having con-
sulted together, one of them said, “We very much
wish you would not go, and if you will consent to
stay, either my sister or myself will be very glad
to marry you.” Thomas thanked them kindly,
and made his selection, (in the carriage being
brought round on the wedding day to take them
to church, Thomas put the ladies in and mounted
the box. “ Where are you going, Thomas ?" the
bride enquired. “I am going to ride on tr.e box,
miss. That is my place atpresent; when we are
married I shall be proud and happy to take a seat
inside the carriage.” Mr. Gee used to frankly tell
this tale about himself.
The postponed sports of the Thistle Club
came off on Saturday, on the Agricultural Society’s
Ground, Moore Park, A. Coleman won the boys
under 15, 330 yards; C. Werry carried off the 150
yards handicap; T. Lawrence won the quarter mile;
A. Thompson won the under 16, hop-step-and-
jump, with 33ft. Sin. The adults hop-step-and-
jump fell to S. Wood’s, who covered 41ft. lOln. J.
W. Byrnes, who arrived too late to compete, for a
special prize cleared the tremendous distance of
46ft. 4in.; J. W. Byrnes made a running-high-jump
of 5ft. lOln.; Cowan carried off the Cumberland
wrestling bout; A. Larcombe and J. Byrnes both
managed to clear 9ft. Sin. in the pole vaulting
contest; J. Hickey put the heavy shot 38ft. Hn.;
W. C. Smith threw the heavy hammer 77ft. Sin.;
8. Lewis won the two miles walk from scratch; H.
W. Thomson carried off the quarter mile obstacle
race; the mile handicap fell to T. Lawrence: and
A. Larcombe tossed the caber 33ft, lOln.
Messrs. C. H. R. Gossett and W. Nicholson
(says an English paper), both of the Temple Bicycle
Club, accomplished a wonderful performance on a
Humber Tandem ” tricycle. They started from
Hounslow at 8.13 a.m., and rode via Bagshot, Win-
chester, Alresford, Alton, Farnham, Guildford,
Ripley, and Kingston, to the Bay Tree atlMerton,
where they turned and retraced their steps to the
eighteenth milestone on.the Portsmouth road, and
then came back to the Angel at Thames Ditton, at
which point, in order to make up the twelve hours,
they rode twice round Thames Ditton Green. The
full distance, taken from “ Paterson’s Road Book,”
is 135 miles, and but for the strong wind, at times
amounting to a gale, which met the men for nearly
half the distance, there is no doubt that they
would have easily covered 150 miles. Every care
was taken to have the performance thoroughly
authenticated, and the timing arrangements were
placed in the hands of Messrs. B. Tegetmeier and
C. H, Larrette (Bell’s Life), the first-named also
acting as starter. The performance is the more
meritorious from the fact that Mr. Gossett, who is
a eousin of the Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of
Commons, is upwards of 43 years of age, whilst his
companion is not what is termed a racing man.
The branch Mercantile R.C. premises were
duly opened on Saturday. The westerly wind
proved a shade too much for the comfort of the
oarsmen who manned the boats forming the pro-
cession; but they struggled through it and arrived
at the branch before the steamers had discharged
their living freight. Both steamers were crowded
to the utmost of their capacity, and upon a land-
ing being effected the crowd wended its way up a
bit of a constitution hill to the premises above.
Alderman Playfair, who actually went without a
cigar during the whole afternoon, then formally
opened the premises with a few words; and Mr.
Harry Wilkinson, the captain of the club, fol-
lowed with a little more speechifying, in which he
wished for the success of New South Wales row-
ing in general, and his own club in particular.
Refreshments were then the order of the day,
after which the steamers were loaded up again
and the visitors landed at Circular Quay between
five and six o’clock. Old and present members
were invited, but it really seemed wonderful
whore all the old hands of only four or five years
ago had gone to. Mr. “Tom” Strange, who had
so often pulled No. 3 for the honour and glory of
his club, was there, and Messrs. Metcalfe and Ben-
son, the “demon” pair oars, and Messrs. “Jack”
Wilkinson, Lockyer. Walford, and “Sid.” Bull,
but there the list about ends. Of course Messrs.
“ Bob ” Keddle, Blachman, and “ Joe ” Smart were
there, but in the role of active members. We
might as well look for the millennium as for them
to figure in the list of “have beens.”
Fred. J. Engelhardt, who is supposed to
know a thing or two about pedestrians and pedes-
trianism. recently furnished the San Francisco
Call with some interesting matter on this subject.
Discussing long distance races, the veteran athlete
said: “None or the stories of men accomplishing
extraordinary pedestrian feats in country places
are ever verified when they are brought on
measured tracks, and it is doubtful if the famous
Indian runners and mail-carriers, of whom we
hear and read so much, could live half the dis-
tance with our trained pedestrians. The loss of
sleep is very trying, and the excessive heat pro-
duced by great exertion creates an almost in-
satiable thirst. Harriman drinks more on the
track than any other man I ever knew. I have
known him to drink four dozen bottles of ginger
ale in 24 hours 1 O’Leary and Hughes must have
champagne in large quantities, Watson drank
but little—beef tea, gruel, and tea were his chief
beverages. Rowell also combats his thirst, and
both ot the latter are good feeders on the track,
while the drinkers are not. Many think they must
eat all they can hold before starting, as they will
have no opportunity to eat at leisure during a race.
That is a fatal mistake, because the overheating of
the system and the excitement of the contest ar-
rest digestion and bring trouble. A man should
start in a race with an almost empty stomach—
with the last food taken well digested; then con-
trol his thirst, and once over the Inevitable fever-
ish conditions of the first day, the appetite will
come, and, with careful nursing, those ugly crises
are easily overcome.”
“ Pcmem et o ircemes /” used to be the cry of
the Roman populace-a piece of information which
you may have heard before. And whatever bread
they got, they had plenty of circuses. Things were
different when Rome became the religious metro-
polis of the earth. Then the people had to be
satisfied with pious processions and bambino
shows, and such things, with an annual concession
to the devil during the carnival week. Now, how-
ever, things hnve changed again. The good King
Humbert has done this. He has established a
Derby Day in Italy, and it has turned out a large
success. As a matter of course, Home is filled
with English bookmakers during the race week.
We are not aware exactly at what time of the year
the race comes off, but if the date be not remote
we look forward to hear of our own Joe Thompson
laying the odds on the classic ground that Cicero
used to tread. And the gay Barney—will he not
have made conquests among the Roman coun-
tesses ? If he does not, he is no longer the Barney
of old. Imagine the Thompsons—their big breast-
pins flashing like tin plates on a far-off hillside in
the sunlight—standing in the Colosseum, where the
old patricians used to make up their books by the
thousand sesterces, and the cry of “ habet” with
the down-turned thumbs from the imperial box
sent the soul of many a Thracian gladiator to
Hades ! Yes, imagine it—and then imagine Joe
saying to Barney; “ Barney, I’ll toss you for half
a couter — winner shouts.” But is Barney in
Europe? We don't know, and don’t much care.
We shall, however, expect to hear of Billy Swords
at the Roman Derby backing the Pope for a
hundred yards against all comers.
We belong to a generation in which Beauty
alone will not make a man majestic. Since Mrs.
Timmins, with the help of a broomhandle, ex-
pounded, in the presence of her neighbours, the
Gospel of Usefulness, which exposition had a
direct bearing on the relation Mr, Timmins bore
to the on-looking universe, no man feels that his
straddle is the thing until ho has let the world see
that he is useful as well as beautiful. How beauti-
ful on the sward of Old England were the feet of
our cricketers I Antecedently to Mrs. Timmins’
time, those feet, and the feats of which those feet
were the substructure, would have entitled the
travelled darlings to an immortality of Imperial
esteem. But the world has become innoculated
with Mrs. Tlmminsism, and even Murdoch and
Alexander lay themselves out to give a fillip to
their straddle. A fillip to their straddle ? Decidedly.
Are we not in receipt of the cheering news that
the effect of our team going home “ is to excite
interest in and inquiry respecting Australia among
the working classes.” Alexander declares that he
has had to employ a batch of clerks to answer the
innumerable letters he receives daily soliciting his
counsel as to emigration. And Murdoch holds up
for everybody’s inspection a letter sent to him by
a Yorkshire gardener wanting to know whether
Murdoch would recommend him “ to g’ out there.”
Thus our cricketers desire it to be known that
they perform some of the most important func-
tions of the Agent-General’s office. Thus they are
not alone the beautiful creatures we have been in
the habit of considering them, but persons of
widely acknowledged use in contributing to the
population of this great young country. And
thus, with this fillip to their straddle, they fulfil
Mrs. Timmins’ conditions and are majestic men.

Mask balls have been ® JF
Sydney of late years, that those pern' 0 h n8^°y t g°£er
enough to be friends of members of the Deutsctier
Club enjoyed a real novelty on Friday5 1 *”™ ivo'
Members and invitees together numbered owloa
and, as it was clearly specified that tonoy drew ana
masks were essential to admittance (at d »
up to 11 o’clock), the masqueradei wasi no'halt ana
half affair. At the same an evening claw

was astonishing how well np - s identity

The suite of club rooms are at 53 and 56 Castle
reagh-street, and, sopn after 8 guests
came rapidly In; and, after a little fixing,
or obtaining the temporary loan of a mask
from suave Mr. Genese. soon
■wav into the large ballroom at the naca.
It fs a fine room, and has lately been well deco-
rated a nlatform, with an immense national
banner over it, is at one end, and the band p aved
in an adjoining room. Proceedings, of which a
complete programme in English and German wm
printed, opened by a Procession headed by Prince
Carnival and suite, and the band, and then a polo
naise march was performed, in which everyone
fmo ntifj two OrdinRry qaiicgs touowcOf
interspersed an address; a Tyrolese concert
after the style of the Saltcellar troupe; an operatic
duet of an original kind; and Count Luxembjourgs
favourite dance, a performance which convinced
Us that the Count must have had a remarkable
taste in dancing. Messrs. Arnold and Bamplch.as
clowns, were the liveliest com pan y i m«r i “j 6 '
Of course, maskers do not wait for introductions
to one «nother, and the fun that goes on be-
tween those who tblpK they know one an-
other, but don’t, or vite MrM. W o“ e of the
Chief charms of the masquerade. When one
masker fancies he has discovered another, he
takes her hand and traces on it the initials of
her name. A shake of the head convinces him he
is wrong, but, even if mistaken, the act is not
accounted as any breach ot etiquette. Some
masks were complete cardboard faces of grotesque
and elaborate make, and certainly the most comi-
nal was that of a caricatured German soldier who
wis Constantly on ar the salute, with huge goggle
eyes, and a face that was Intensely natural, though
hardly handsome. Dr. Horn was a doctor of laws
in a good disguise!; Mr. John Young, an old-time
Sydney alderman ; Mr. Sussmilch.a F [®“®kpage;
Mr. Twietmeyer, a brigand ; Mr. E b® ro ?™P* *
splendid make-up as ‘‘a Forester good, M ev«*
drew bow in the merry greenwood. One gentle-
man changed his dress four times, to the perpetual
mystification of his friends. Mr. Kretschrnanu,
the well-known musical professor, wore a rich
velvet robe as Doge of Venice; and Mr, Von dor
Heyde, president of the club, wore an officer s uni-
form ; Mr. Lenartz was a policeman, who thought it
derogatory for a member of the fores to dance. At
half-past ten masks wore removed—which was a
relief, for they were rather warm—-and then there
Was quite a chorus of laughing ohs! as mutual
recognitions were made on oil sides. We may say
that the masquerade was thoroughly carried out,
and completely successful. Programmes, contain-
ing eight dances were then handed round, and
when these were done, as well as a tew extra
waltzes, a second distribution took place at about
3 a.m., and these again were filled as before. A
very formidable-looking item on the card was the
Rheinlaender, but after looking anxiously round
for a safe place to get. from which to view the
gallant Gormans struggling with the Rheinlaender
* turned out to be a schottische. As far as spell-
ing goes, the schottische and the rheinlaender
seem to be very much like Ctesar and Pompey. It
was a great relief to find that the terrible-looking
thing was only our old friend, consisting of two
forward and two back and four steps round, and
exclaiming, triumphantly “ why, wc can do that I
we offered ourselves, with a salaam and a crook in
our arm. to the prettiest little Fraulien that ever
did credit to the Fatherland. We are always going
to ask for a Rheinlaender in future. About mid-
night, all went upstairs, where, in various rooms
and verandahs, large tables and small, sufficient to
seat all the ladies at once, were laid out with a
splendid supper. After tnat, it seemed quite easy
to keep the Pali up to six in the morning. Music
was played faster than at usual balls, but the
selection of tunes was excellent. The ladles bore
their characters well, and some were exceedingly
pretty. Mrs Von der Heyde was an Elizabethan
court lady; Mrs. Spencer, Catherine ot Arragon;
and her handsome daughter took the part of the
cruel beauty, Lucretia Borgia Madame Marius
was splendidly suited by a taney dress of the Wat-
teau kind, and her vivacity showed how she en-
joyed the scene. Miss Marie St. Clair wore a sump-
tuous costume with a green satin court tram, and
white wig, as the Grand Duchess of Gerplstem; and
Miss St. Clair made an enchanting Skipping Girl. A
cnaraoter showing originality was that ; ot the
White Cat, taken by Miss Groth—all white satin
trimmed with fur, and a white fur head; around
her neck was a rod collar bearing the peculiar
wdrQiQiir! Touch not th© cst but witb th©
glove,” the motto of tho clan Chattan, and
which was very suggestive of the scratching
propensities of—say, cati. It is not every girl
who would be so frank in warning her admirers.
Miss Groth, number two, wore a military costume
that looked like Claudine, and which served to
Biow how nicely she could dance. Miss Sohroeder
made a dual appearance, first as a Tyrolese pea-
sant, and afterwards as Little Nell. Miss Boeke-
m inn wore an exceedingly pretty velvet dress as
Minerva, the goddess of hunting, with bows and
arrows, and looked very symmetrical. A little
German sailor lass in white and navy blue was a
caarming dancer , and so was Red Riding Hood.
One of the most admired was Miss Young s dress
as a Grecian Girl, white drapery in classic
folds Mrs. Blackman was artistically dressed
as Regan in “King Lear.” An evening dress
that was perfectly beautiful was an otto-
man broche of most delicate pink, and lovely
lace skirt In small bounces to match. It
was called the best in tho ropm; though a pure
white satin trimmed with white jet and swans-
down, and worn by Mrs. Hurst with a white wig,
was also a splendid dress. Miss Lenartz was a
fascinating Flower Girl in ethereal white, with a
irotn of a hat; and Mrs. Ezold a capital peasant
from Calabria, or somewhere. Mrs. Hamburger
wore a jockey’s attire, old gold skirt and black
s itin bodice, combination jockey cap. io return
a moment to the gentlemen: one wore a continental
looking costume, with a hat labelled: Debra of
Luxembourg.” It may seem very ignorant ot us
not to know who Debra of Luxembourg is, but
we don’t; we only know he was there because it
was advertised on nis hat. Mr. Hamburger, too,
as a French Jockey was good, as was another
iookey in scarlet silk. Mr. Riess wore a peculiar
costume of coloured wool-work upon wnite canvas
foundation: and Mr. Blackman personated Figaro.
Among the guests were Captain PJuddemann, and
other German officers of the Albatross, Mr.
Boekemann was Cards, being covered with them.
There is no doubt that the Deutscher Clnb’s
masquerade stands out as one of the most unique
and pleasant balls of the season.

Complimentary performances are gener-
ally oooular, and the Balmain Dramatic Amateurs
had a crowded audience at their quarterly enter-
tainment on Friday, when Taylors comedy of
“Still Waters run Deep" was given. Additional
Interest was thrown over the performance by the
dftbut of a well-known young lady from North
Shore in the field of drama. Many ladies, in view
nf a (ianefl following, tonnod full dress, and the
went satisfactorily nil through except for
the stupid “guying” in-lulged in by some noisy
ho vsinthe gallery fto whom manners are as yet
onfy a thing ofthe future. The parts of Mrs
Sternhold aud Mrs, Mildmay were taken by M ss
Berthr Phillips and Miss E. Granville, respectively,
with careful intelligence, and Capt. Hawksley was
acted by Mr. Walter Perdrlau. Mr. Frank Smith
was John Mildraay. Most of the applause was
earned, and fairly, by Messrs. Alf. Perry and Frank
Jones as Mr. Potter and Dunhilk. Mr. C- Hobson’s
string* band enlivened the evening with musical
pieces until half-past 10, and Mr. W. Walker acted
as stage manager. After that hour, seats were
moved, and a large proportion of the company
stayed and danced in the School of Arts till one
o’clock had gone, and with refreshments and
choice partners, an excellent three hours’ party
was enjoyed.
* * *
It was an elysian day; a day when the air
is radiant and the breeze vital, and the wavelets
dance and dazzle under the sun; when a mantle
of glory has fallen on the earth and sea; when the
spirit is buoyant, and the eye grows bright, and
the heart keeps young. It was a day like this that
the M.K.C. had for the opening of their club-house
and cottage residence at Blandsville. There must
have been nearly 800 people on board the A lathea
and Defiance as they steamed away from Circular
Quay and up the sparkling river soon after two.
There was everything to make the trip pleasant-
mutual acquaintance, for most of the guests had
either been before to the club’s regattas or balls,
or were going!to its annual on the 3rd July; the
soft music of a string band merged with the buzz
of the talking crowd; and on each side were the
racing boats of the various clubs, with their uni-
formed crews, who started in procession and
accompanied the two steamers to the afternoon’s
destination. One sex puffed its inevitable cigar-
ette, and the other sex was charmingly well
dressed—and that filled them with a feeling of
perfect peace. If we do not describe the pretty
toilettes that caused this holy calm to pervade the
female bosom, it is because there were too many
of them. We dare not start on such a list. But to
the sex collectively, who went up the sparkling
river on Saturday, we offer three demure little
stanzas:—
There. That saves us from describing how Miss
Srnytbo wore a crushed cranberry dolman, and
Miss Browne took well in sky-blue. IBlandsville
was reached soon, and on debarking, the company
passed through the boathouse and up tho hill to
the cottage, from the verandah of which Mr.
Thomas Playfair made a speech, which we didn’t
hear. Tea and coffee were served round to the
ladies, though the resources were severely taxed
to find crockery for so many, and the bracing
journey had given them more than fairylike appe-
tites. Sundry bottles circulated among the rowers
and their friends, and about an hour was spent
strolling about the hillside, which is still in its
primitive state, and in inspecting the buildings.
The chief is a comfortable wooden cottage, with a
large general room and a large bedroom, furnished
with a spartan disregard of luxury whicb quite
raised the pity of some of the fair ones who were
gratified by a peep at it. Coloured pictures adorn
the walls. Attached is a kitchen, and a snug cot-
tage at the back is for the caretaker. As the sun
got low, a start was made for Sydney, where all
landed at dusk after a very pleasant afternoon.
♦ * *
His Excellency the Governor held the
usual Queen’s Birthday levee at Government
House on Saturday last. It is always a function of
the most solemn kind. But the idea of sacrificing
a glorious holiday afternoon to strut for one brief
hour in funereal black, to talk with bated breath
and gloomy visage, was too solemn for manv
people even to think of; hence the attend-
ance of the general public was not large.
Just 135 persons. Those who had the right
of entree were most fortunate, as they could
get away early and go picnicking or some-
thing. Among them were the judges, Ministry,
chief civil officials, ecclesiastics, members of Par-
liament and the learned professions, foreign
consuls, military and naval officers, &c. Lord
Loftus wore bis court costume and usual courtly
smile. Before i o’c’ock the string of carriages
rolled away, the soldiers were relieved from their
irksome guard, and the purlieus of Government
House resumed that quiet peacefulness which is
so seldom disturbed.

The bachelors of Bathurst issued a large
number of invitations to their annual reunion for
the 27th June, and about 120 ladies and gentlemen,
among whom were the best people of tne city and
neighbourhood and some Sydney visitor?, met on
that night to dance. It was said that a better
assemble of dancers had never been seen together
at Bathurst. The hall was brilliantly lighted and
decorated, and several large coal fires were burn-
ing in the grates, though they were certainly
superfluous after tne first half hour’s dancing. To
the surprise and evident enjoyment of the ladies,
men were in the majority, so no neglected
flowers drooped their heads against the wall;
and the beautiful girls were sought and besieged,
and steered round with all the graceful solicitude
that ought always to be shown to such fairylike
creatures. At the same time, however, when a
weak young man gets hold of an indisputably
heavy fairy, he can only do his best. By courtesy,
the married ladies claim first notice, and they de-
serve more than passing mention. The dress of
Mrs. Spencer, a black, with birds of yellow
plumage perched here and there, had a most
charming effect. The dress of Mrs. Monro, a
yellow satin draped with black lace, and
that of Mrs. Jago Smith, a combination in
which pink was the prevailing colour, were both
costumes of great merit. An attorney’s wife, with
a decidedly pretty face, garbed in white satin,
excited much admiration; as did also a widow of
graceful mien, in a toilette of pink. In the choice
of belle, opinions varied. Miss Kate Lee, in pink,
and Miss Dolly MTntosh, in a costume approach-
ing old gold colour, had the chief cialms to that
honour, besides being excellent dancers. A fair
maiden in white—it being her first ball—had no-
thing to complain of as to want of partners, all of
whom seemed to be only too anxious to ensure
her the evening’s enjoyment. The ladies from the
Bank were dressed with exquisite taste, and
danced perfectly ; Miss Smith was clad in pale
pink; and Miss M’Phillamy in a white skirt and
satin bodice, heavily ornamented with silver work
and Elizabethan collar, looked regal; Miss Ma-
chattie, in sky-blue, had a host of admirers; and
Miss Kutherford, in white, received adulation.
Programmes were completed in good time, and
the ladies left hoping that the surviving bache-
lors of next year will be as hospitable as those of
this.
♦ * •
Last Friday’s Social at Tatteraall’s Hall,
was a good evening for the gentlemen; as ladies
being more numerous, even the poorest male per-
formers stood a chance. Even the men who always
want so much room, and the Bambini style of
flutterers, and the men with extensive feet, all
came in for partners. The room was very warm,
and rather full in the round dances. Mr. Hott s
place as hon. sec. has been filled by Mr. F.
Dixon. Dresses were capital, and a lady from
Castlereagh-street was deemed belle in cardinal
broche, with silver band jauntily set in her hair.
An admired dress was blue satin bodice, and
flounced skirt of similar colour, worn by a
brunette. A popular vocalist wore ruby and
pink; while her sister wore a broche with fine
muslin skirt. A lady from Surry Hills was charm-
ing in velvet. A charmingly simple toilette was or
white muslin, relieved by a black; velvet band at
the waist. Music by Mr, O'Connor and assistants,
and break-up before midnight.

On Friday night, a social banquet was
held in the new rooms of the Builders’ and Con-
tractors’ Association, Pltt-street. Moon catered
for the hundred gay and festive housebuilders,
who were headed by Mr. Thomas Birks (President)
In the chair, supported by Messrs. Cameron and
Poole, M.’s P. There was a band to cheer them on
in their attack upon the courses, and voluntary
songs were given by various members. Tornlng
decorated.

Mrs. Alphen’s Annual Audit took place
on Wednesday last week, at 8t. John’s School,
Ashfleld, and a well selected programme was
creditably carried out. That part devoted to the
youngsters was interesting,’especially were the
piano duets by the smaller pupils. A rather re-
markable reading was given by an Ashfleld
gentleman on “ Black Oats. Gottsohalk’s * Home,
Sweet Home,” and “Meditation,” were sweetly
played by a young lady - amateur, whoso name was
forgotten on the programme, and several good
songs were given. Most of the audience were
friends of the pupils, and included many leading
suburban residents. *
* * *
In the Mudgeb Telegraph a lady named
Dorothy has been “giving away” her sex in a
manner most awful. It seems, by what we can
gather from Dorothy’s screed, that about 400 of
the local girls are In training for the belle contest,
which will occur at the opening railway ball, and
this is how they do it. Consultations are held
before the mirror, when dainty forms pose in
graceful attitudes. Bewildering are the facial
manoeuvres; first, the face is wreathed in alluring
smiles, then melts into a touching look of tender-
ness, next brightens with the glow of pride, and.
fades into the arched glance of coquetry—with a
grand finale of a glistening tear-drop, which starts
from the eyelash, and falls with a splash on the lip
below. That’s the first part. Then there’s the
figure, and “ beauty unadorned,” however irresis-
tible in a sylvan grove, doesn’t meet the exigen-
cies of a ball-room. And yet, and this is the worst
of it, Mudgee girls, when unadorned, don’t
score high as regards beauty of figure. So the
modiste has to —-out, really, the subject verges so
on the mysterious borderland which no man dares
invade, that Dorothy shocks us, and we have to
skip a few lines to come to the context itself, and
awarding of the prize. Dorothy accuses the Press
generally of shirking its duty in these delicate
matters. Either through incapacity to distinguish
genuineness, the editorial decision is vaguely in-
definite,—or else through a shrinking fear of con-
sequences which has no merit in the eyes of lovely
competitors, the responsibility of a decision's
evaded altogether—and there is no belle at all.
Dorothy suggests a jury be empannelled of six
gentlemen, ages from 20 to 60, and six ladies who
will vary from girlhood to “ old china.” Then
shall there be no more fear and trembling in the
soul of the reporter who describes nature and art
—no more uncertainty among the girls—and justice
shall be done to the Belle of the Ball. What a pity
that a woman with a brain like Dorothy’s should bo
at Mudgee—or at large!

The Narandera ladies’ second, hop of the
season took place on 27th uit., and was a success,
about fifty couples attending. Belle honours were
awarded to Miss Primrose, a new arrival, in ruby
velvet; and Miss Crackenthorp, from Goulburn,
in blue and prune satin. Three young ladies from
Mount Ottiwell, in pink veiling, looked admirably
well, as also did two sisters from Yarrobee Park,
in fawn satin and cashmere. Miss Elworthy, in
blue llama skirt, broche grenadine polonaise, or-
namented with blue feathers and silver ivy-leaves;
Miss Devlin, in lavender ana white satin; Miss
Stinson, in scarlet satin and white cashmere; and
Miss Phillips, in pink and cardinal satin, each
looked well. Miss Bocquet, In all black, with large
fan, was decidedly aesthetic. Foremost among the
married ladies were—Mrs. Willans, in cream and
ruby Mrs. Christy,in pink satin: and Mrs. Bowes,
in white silk toilette. Creditable management by
Mrs. King, and good music by Broadhurst, of
Wagga. * * *
Tamworth had its second Winter Party
freshened by some nice new faces. Among them
was that of the belle, a dark-haired girl, simply
dressedin white and pearls. Her sister looked pretty
in blue nun’s veiling and lace, hair “ done ” high. A
vivacious little lady from Murrurundl was much
admired, and j ustly; and two sisters from A ttunga,
in pale cream and pink, looked charming, as usual.
The graceful dancing of a girl in black, trimmed
with white lace, was especially remarked. A
married lady suited her brunette fascinations with
pale pink muslin. Music very good, all over at
naif-past two, and everybody seemingly satisfied.

The Young Australians) of the G.U.O.O.
held a ball in their new hall, Braidwood, on 26th
June, and about 80 were present. Heart-rending
faces, bewitching smiles, and ensnaring raiment
are said by the young enthusiast who came down
to tell us about it, to have prevailed among the
ladies. The floor was so well spermed that lots of
young people lost their feet as well as their heads;
and one cavalier wrought the success of the even-
ing by shooting two ladles at once across the floor
and under the opposite seats. But Braidwood has
such a cold climate that they excuse a little extra
vigour there. Besides, so Jong as the young men
are somewhat active, they can't become dudes.
Cards and draughts were for the quiet section of
the guests, and a good supper was for all. Dancing
was kept up till 5, and the belle was like a summer
sky—all white and blue.

On the night of the 4th July there will be
two American balls—one at the new Masonic Hall,
which will be a very rccherchS affair; and one at
the Exhibition, which will be a masquerade, and,
consequently, rather a novelty. Everyone is ex-
pected to be disguised and to wear a mask. The
Visitors can go disguised in anything but liquor.
The committee intend to be most rigid in keeping
it Kroner. and the scene from the gallery (for which
spectators' tickets are advertised at 3s.) will be
worth seeing. „
This night (Thursday) the long-expected
Mercantile Bowing Club ball comes off at the
Exhibition, and there is no doubt that for dancers
u wfil be the ball of the season. Youth and skill
always characterise most of its patrons. The
arrangements have been most carefully made to
render the ball equal to what it has always been,
ffnlv evening costume will be worn, so that the
fanev dresses can have a rest, and some ot their
ownlrs will have less chance of catching cold. The
Young Australian Band will play; dancing to
atari- at 9 Guests are recommended to write their
names plainly on their pregiatnmes, and then, if
thecards are dropped, they are almost sure to
laveThem returned by some friend, or put in

A man may admire, mayn’t he,
Anything natty and neat,
Anything pretty and dainty,
That he may chance to meet ?
There is nothing that’s strange or funny
In enjoying, we should say.
Faces all sweet and sunny
And bright as a halcyon day.
Is It sin that Is past forgiving
To gaze upon beauty so ?
Why I a girl’s life isn’t worth living
If she never attracts a beau!
And it seems—at least to our thinking—
That beauty is passing fair
When the sun in her eyes is blinking.
And the wanton wind in her hair;
When a shade from a fall or feather
Is thrown over speaking eyes,
That fool a man altogether.
Be he never so gravely wise;
When beauty—what fashions garb her! —
With softly incessant tongue
Is'atloat on “ our beautiful harbour,”
On a day when the heart is young.

In any matter connected with or arising out of the
contract of the 30th of April, 1884, Hereinafter
mentioned; but the subscribers will be held to
have approved the appointment of those gentle-
men as directors. The board will be represented
in the colonies by the gentlemen who have hither-
to represented the firms of Dalgety, Blackwood,
and Co., Dalgety, Ibbotson, and Co., and Dalgety
and Company.
The extent of the consignments of wool to
Dalgety, Du Croz, and Co. during the last three
years, and their proportion of those of the two
prominent agency companies of Australasia, as
well as to the total import, are shown by the fol-
lowing table:—
The present position of the above two oom-
panles being as under:—
The terms of transfer to the company as from 1st
July. 1884, of the businesses above mentioned as
going concerns are—l«t, the payment, on or be-
fore the 1st December, 1884, of the amounts
standing in the books of the partnership to the
credit of the several vendors; 2nd, the payment for
the goodwill, in £130,000 4>6 per cent, irredeemable
debenture stock; 3rd, the purchase by the com-
pany at a valuation (not to exceed £60,000) of the
freehold business premises in Melbourne, Christ-
church, and Dunedin, as also the leasehold pre-
mises and wharf in Sydney and Newcastle, to-
gether with th« plant which at the date of the
transfer may belong to the vendors. A right is
reserved to the directors (other than those who
are members of the vendors’ firm) to elect, at any
time during one year, whether any of the ac-
counts taken over by the company on 1st July
shall be liquidated on behalf and at the risk of the
vendors; as guarantee, the company will mean-
while retain the £130,000 debenture stock.
The price fixed as payment for goodwill is, in
the opinion of the directors (other than those
directors who are members of the vendors’ firm),
a very moderate sum, having regard to the profits
realised by the vendors during recent years.
A contract (above referred to, embodying the
terms of transfer), dated 30th of April, 1884, has
been entered into with Messrs. Dalgety, Du Croz,
and Co., Dalgety, Blackwood, and Co., Dalgety,
Ibbotson, and Co., and Dalgety and Company, for
the transfer of their businesses to the company in
consideration of the payment by the company of
the sums of money previously mentioned, and
provides amongst other things that Messi-s. Dal-
Sety, P. A. Du Croz, Doxat, Saunders, and S, J. Du
roz, who are interested as vendors, shall become
directors of the company. The parties to this
contract are Frederick Gonnerman Dalgety, Fred-
erick Augustus Du Croz. Edmund Theodore Doxat,
Henry Wilson Domain Saunders, Septimus John-
son Du Croz, Arthur Ranken Blackwood, Alfred
Charles Ibbotson, James Aitken, Frederick Henry
Moore, and Thomas Forster Knox, of the one
part, and Dalgety and Company Limited, of the
other part. This contract is scheduled to the
Articles of Association, and has been executed by
the board in accordance with the provisions of
those articles. A copy of this contract, as also the

dance was to close the jubilee last night — Last

TO THE MEMBER FOR " MUMM."
‘ Mr. Henry M'Quade, the worthy representative of
the Hawkeshury district, intends to have the approach-
ing meeting on Fairfield Estate a grand success, if
labour and expense will add to its attractiveness.”
E know, dear Harry, you are dumb ;
All eye-glass, silence, and the rest;
But we’re not sure, though it sounds
rum,
That your kind don’t get on the best.
You never say a blessed word—
You cause no legislative “ hush!”
Your fate, it ever has occurred,
Has been to entertain the “ push.”
What your opinions are, God knowg!
You legislate on food an i drinks—
Or so they say—and seem to pose
A kind of legislative Sphinx.
Howe’er you do your local work,
A mystery 's to us, indeed!
Your mouth hut opens for a fork,
Your eloquence but tails a feed.
We’d like to know your little views -
Come, out with them! don’t be afiaid.
We’re sick of reading in the News
“Responded to by H. M‘Quade.”
Do sometfijRp-thunderl—or we’ll die!
Do what your noble confreres do;
Come, “ bif ” a Member in the eye,
fc.Or fall down stairs a time or two!
The enmity of all arouse—
Yes! sneers at some pure lady poke;
Then come next day down to the House
And say it was your “little joke.”
Be quick! Do something of this kind.
Or else, “ sweet Hal,” we tell you true,
Ycur country will, and just you mind,
Have lost its confidence in you.
Enough for Wisdom—or, we see.
If more into this theme we wade.
We’ll not, to all eternity.
Be “entertained by H. M’Quade.”
Bo, down our dictum he it laid,
We say it with the hunaryrest:
That Members like the great M‘Quade
Do really seem to get on best.
His praises, therefore, let us ring!
To blazes with this doggrel strain I
Please, pass along the “liver wing,”
And just a gliss of dry champagne.
This is such a sceptical age that people are
positively deriding the prolty custom of deposit-
ing a set of current coins beneath the foundation
stone of any great public edifice. Thirty-eight
years ago, the stone of Prince's Bridge, Melbourne,
was laid, and in a small hole drilled therein, was
placed a bottle, carefully sealed, containing a
document and the usual bits of money. Now that
the bridge is being demolished, the contractors
have turned up the foundation-stone, the bottle,
and the parchment—but, alas I no money. A
little Yarra water had found its way into the
bottle, and the seal had been tampered with. With-
out any reflection upon the integrity of the pri-
meval Port Phillip labourer, we are bound to
admit that, although a few drops of Yarra—un-
sweetened— might dissolve any quantity of coins
in the course of thirty-eight years, still the action
of the water could hardly be expected to change a
seal. All things considered, it would be far more
practical to distribute foundation cains among the
workmen than to go through the ridiculous cere-
mony of burying them. It only puts someone to
the trouble of digging ’em up again.
On Palm Sunday last, the Pope received
the customary 120 palm-tree branches from the
Bresca family, of San Kemo, of which Monsignor
Breica is to-day the head. The right to present
these branches was granted the Brescas In 1586. In
that year, on the 10th September, the granite
obelisk which now stands la St. Peter’s Square was
being raised by 140 horses, 35 machines, and over
1000 men. Silence was preserved bv the presence of
the hangman, who, by order of Pope Sextus, was
ready to hang anyone who disturbed the perform-
ance. The monolith of the old circus of Caligula
wrs nearly erect, when the caaflng of ropes began
to give way. A powerful voice shouted, “ Acqua
a'lecorne," or ‘ Water to thoropcsl” The archi-
tect caught the idea and complied with the sug-
gestion. The obelisk triumphantly rose on the
pedestal. The trespasser, one Bresca, however,
was arrested. “ Why did you disobey ?” asked the
Pope. “Because I would rather die myself than
see hundreds killed by the fall of the monolith.”
‘‘Well done!” replied the Pope; “what can i do
for you?” Bresca requested the Pooe to grant
him and his successors the privilege of supplying
palms to the Church of St. Peter for Palm Sunday,
and obtained the favour.
The Melbourne Herald has made an an-
nouncement which will throw every Australian
heart into n warm glow. It announces that copies
oi the Herald are to be despatched to "Our
Boys,” at their request, in order that they may
show the ignorant Britons the perfection to which
an evening newspaper can he brought. “They
state,” says the bashful little journal, “that there
i! no evening paper in the ol i country that gives
the nows, both general and sporting, so promptly
and fully «s the Herald does, and that people
seem doubtful when they tell them what thin
Journal does ” However, it’s satisfactory to kpow
that “ copies have been sent by the mail,” so that,
in a few brief weeks our cricketers will be able to
favour English friends with oxtrrctsof “ general
news” (the latest witticisms of the great Purves,
spicy pars, on the Social Evil, and other thrilling
items) from the Melbourne Herald then they
will no longer be “doubtful.” What effect this
will have on the circulation of such obscure
organs as the London Evening Standard or the
Globe it is hard to say, but we guess it will set the
proprietors moving. Anyway, our Melbourne
contemporary is only carrying out the mission of
every Herald— to take a trumpet and “ blow.”
Pacific Commission Des Voeux enacts, in a
regulation much longer than one’s arm, that any
British subject who shall give, sell, barter, ex-
change, traffic, or otherwise supply, or aid, help,
assist, or otherwise lend a hand in supplying, fur-
nishing, or otherwise providing any native, nigger,
darkle,aboriginal, or other autochthones with arm s,
firearms, guns, cannons, pistols, or other shooting
tools, implements, instruments, or other weapons,
or with gunpowder, nitroglycerine, dynamite, gun-
cotton, blasting-powder, or any other substance
manufactured, made, fixed up, or otherwise in any
way concocted to produce a practical effect by ex-
plosion, shall, on conviction thereof, be liable to
punishment as follows: 1. Imprisonment for any
term not exceeding three months, with or without
hard labour, and with or without a fine not ex-
ceeding £10. 3. A flue alone, not exceeding £10,
without any imprisonment. After the prolix ver-
bosity of the clauses of prohibition, the penalty
should at least have been: 1. Death; 3. Imprison-
ment for life, in irons. To enact, proclaim, rule,
order, or otherwise declare an imperial resolution
forbidding the Britisher t > sell firearms or powder
to a Polynesian, under a £10 penalty, is tantamount
to using a 10 ton Armstrong to pot a cook-sparrow.
The thriving little township of Dalton
(wherever the fallen angel that is) has had
quite a lively time of it of late; so much so,
in fact, that a young man with more time than
brains at his command, has written quite a nice
little letter to the Nooze about the frolics. The
principal item seems to be the fact that a travel-
ling tinker paid Dalton a visit, a few days ago, and
liked the place so well that he filled up his tank
with stringy, and in a few hours filled the town
with all the excitement requisite for a polling day,
and enough tinker’s dams to keep the district in
water until 1899. After this, he proceeded to
swallow the senior-constable raw, and would have
succeeded, no doubt, but for the timely assistance
of some townsmen, who tied a iamp-post across
the constable's spine, and thus prevented his total
disappearance. Apropos of the tinker episode, the
Dalton scribe draws attention to the urgent need
which exists for the immediate erection of a large
and substantial lock-up, and then, almost in the
same breath, observes: “ We have a lodge of Good
Templars hero. Surely this is a matter which
ought to secure their active co-operation.” This
i« certainly the first time we ever hea>d that the
existence of a Good Templars’ lodge in a town
necessitated the erection of a lock-up; but we live
and learn. At least, some of us do, and the rest
of us write for the daily papers.
• We are fond of curious “ads.,” and during
a decade we have vainly endeavoured to solve the
mystery of the famous " agony ” Item which
appeared, off and on, for five years in the Times.
and which ran: “ Gobslight is melting, Snails.
Give the raboon a biscuit.” Here, now, is one
from the Herald calculated to make a man enjoy
himself even on a wet Sunday, with a serious
family singing hymns next door: -“ Wanted, a
Gentleman in the truest sense, to wait on families,
soliciting orders for groceries, bread, Ac &c.; must
be a teetotaller, and highly recommended. Apply, ’
&c. Wei), we know that ‘gentleman in the truest
sense ” was procured, too; for he called on us the
other day. Appalled by the sheen of his bell-
topper, the Biloelan butler incautiously allowed
him to pass; and by the time we could hurry on
a coat and shuffle down-stairs, we detected
sounds as of a practised hand manipulating the
keys (warranted ivory) of the time-payment Bord.
We paused outside the parlour-do >r (guaranteed
solid cedar by a perjured landlord), and presently
a pure tenor voice warbled the following:—
From the land of the almond-eyed,
Where the sampans fleck the sea
In a golden argosy,
Comes our eighteen-penny tea!
Here he became much affected. By-and-bye,
heaving a deep sigh, he continued:—
We have hearts that feel for others,
We hold selfishness a sin.
For the poor and for the lowly —
Salmon, seven-pence a tin I
In a lilac scented arbour
There may be a fair maid found,
Lol she picks our sugar, which is
Three-pence half-penny the pou^d!
Here we entered; but with his hand he waved us
off, and continued:—
A gentleman will take the orders—
What is it, now—piease, quick decide!
Though I’m handsome and accomplished,
About me there’s no beastly pride.
Then he swung himself round on the music-stool
(alleged walnut), and gracefully waving his hand,
said: “How’do? Doing a little tum-ti-turn, you
see. I come of a musical family. My father—”
“Is dead,” we said, hastily; yes-saw It in the
papers. Your name is ” “Chalker, sir; and ”
“And,” we hazarded, “ pray what are you ?” He
rose to his feet, drew himself up to his luli height,
and smiting himself on the breast, exclaimed,
" I am a gentleman in the truest sense.” Then we
fell upon him, and beat him. and crushed in his
hat, and plucked out his “dicky” by the roots.
But, all the time we assaulted him with intent to
do grievous bojily harm, he spoke never a word.
It was only'when we had hoisted him over the gate,
and ho had fallen with a thud on the side-walk,
that he looked reproachfully up, and said, “Nice
treatment, this, to one who is a gentleman in the
truest sense ” Then he rose with difficulty, and
adjusting his attire to the best of his ability, the
gentleman in the truest sense put his card-board
box of samples under his arm, and walked round
the corner to inquire of the butcher if he knew of
a family in the neighbourhood whose tast' 8 assimi-
lated with the icsthetic and the musical, and the
boss of which invariably received his visitors in
carpet slippers.
The Bad and Worthless
are never imitated or counterfeited. This is es-
pecially true of a family medicine, and it is positive
proof that the remedy imitated is of the highest
value. As soon as it had been tested and proved
by the whole world that Hop Bitters was the pur-
est, best and most valuable family medicine on
earth, many imitations sprung up and began to
steal the notices in which the press and the people
of the country had expressed the merits of H. B.
and in every way trying to induce suffering in-
valids to use their stuff Instead, expecting to make
money on the credit and good name of H. B
Many others started nostrums put up in similar
style to H. B., with variously devised names in
which the word “ Hop ” or “ Hops ” were used in a
way to induce people to believe they were the
same as Hop Bitters. All such pretended remedies
or cures, no matter what their style or name is,
and especially those with the word “Hop” or
“ Hops ” in their name or in any way connected
with them or their name, are imitations or
counterfeits. Beware of them. Touch none of
them. [Jse nothing but genuine American Hop

As a humounstjof the grim description, the
Job took the pastry from ad comers
during the patriarchal ages, and the Lamentations
of old Jeremiah prove that he was no slouch oi a
Joker either, but, in our bumble opinion, there's
more of the real article even 1 q a bad “ fotoe ” of
Mr, Olfioial Assignee Stephens than there was in
all the ancient Biblical Joe Millers Jammed to-
gether. Here’s a sample of one of his very latest
screams. A certain well-known firm in Young,
who had proved in the estate of W. H. Funnell to
the tune of £7 13s. 7d. some time since, received a
letter from Mr. Stephens, O.A., conveying the Joy-
ful Intelligence that a dividend in the said estate
was then available for all those who thought lit to
claim it. The Young merchants were of course
delighted, and after remarking to each other tuat
the days of honour and chivalry had returned, a
thankful letter was forwarded and the partners,
la recommending their fellowmen to the special
protection of Providence in their prayers that
night, made speeial mention of the glorious name
of Stephens. Right here was the time for the
Sonias of the Insolvency Court to boom, and boom
did In the shape of t >e following prize epistle:—
“Estate W.IH. Funnell. Gentlemen, Enclosed, I
send you a Id. stamp, being the amount of your
dividend In the above estate, for which please ac-
knowledge receipt. Yours faithfully, E. M.
Stephens, official assign* e,” Wasn't it lovely, and
another triumpn to the noble army of red-tape !
Apart from the reckless extravagance in
stationery, and the loss of valuable time, it cost
the olfioial assignee a 3d. stamp to notify that Id.
wtf payable; 3d. to the creditor so apply for it,
2d. to the estate to send It, and as a fitting climax
to the whole, the receivers were humorously
asked to expend another 2d. In acknowledging the
receipt of Id. This is honesty with a vengeance,
and no wonder that the prayerful firm interested
subsequently hired a civilised Chinaman for a
week to curse the whole of the Insolvency Court
back as far as the 47th generation.
A few days ago, Mr. Triekett, in answer to
a conundrum from Mr. Burdekin touching the
payment of school teachers for the cleaning* of
schools, observed that he could only distribute the
money as far as it would go, and he was not pre-
pared to say whether he would reconsider the
adjustment. Respecting this delicate matter, we
have a tew words to sav. Imprimis, we are in re-
ceipt of a circular signed by a party by the
name of Johnson, and from this circular we
learn that the allowance made for school cleansing
expenses runs as follows:—E'er a Hrst-class school,
three departments, 14s. a week; second, three
ditto, 11a.; third, three ditto, 9s.; fourth, two
ditto, OS. 6d.; fifth, 4s.; sixth, 3s.; seventh, eighth,
ninth, and tenth, Is. Furthermore, we find that
“ the above allowances are the maximum amounts,
and only the sums actually paid for cleaning
should be charged.” Or, In other words, It the
teacher of a seventh-class school can manage to
vet a highly respectable, well-educated young per-
son to swab out the said school, wash the windows,
and tidy up the yard for 114d a week, that teacher
has no right to charge Is. to the Government, and
Hash about in costly garments and give fancy
dress balls, and keep 3.30 trotters and expensive
buggies on the strength of all be makes over the
sums actually paid to the cleaner. This Is good,
and it betrays a Jealous watchfulness over the
public money which would be praiseworthy in the
extreme were it not equally ridiculous. Neither
the Minister for Education nor Heaven ever de-
signed that the teacher of a seventh-class school
should become a Vanderbilt or Rothschild in less
than five years; and, therefore, in the name of the
whole colony of New South Wales, we now beg
leave to tender a big vote of thanks to our econo-
mical Minister, and, when that’s through, we'll
throw a little one in for the party by the name of
Johnson. This, however, Is notall the joy, fora
foot-note to the circular states a retrospective
policy will be adopted in the case of the noble
army of cleaners, and all teachers who have
already been paid from 1st January last in aocord-
ance with a higher scale than that given above,
the sums overpaid will be deducted from the
amounts that would to payable to them by the
now scale. Not a single chance by whi h an
avariciously-inclined teacher could amass a for-
tune is given, but the unfortunate pedagogue is
so hemmed in by the rules and regulations Issued
that in some cases he would save money by paying
ail expenses out of bis own pocket, and making
the State a present of his salary. This much we
learn from the circular. Now we’ll take “a hand”
ourselves. First of all, It is distinctly pointed out
that the teacher in charge of a school is held re-
sponsible for its sanitary condition. Therefore, if
l he man who has Sophocles and Cicero “ by heart,”
who can tie up one leg and dance rings round old
Bishop Colenso’s ghost In the intr cate mazes of
algebra, and who has forgotten more about the
English language than Bindley Murray ever kn«»
if this man, with his mighty brain and cn
mind cannot find a dead-beat about htodtetrk?
who Is willing to earn a stray “bob” or so in th
way of “chars,” he must put his gigantic ihSi
lect down a hole for a lime, and start slushing?,:
things for the princely sum of 2d. a day, and flnJ
his own brooms and buckets I The scnools of ?fi
colony were cleaned by their teachers for
years without any extra fee for doing so. Mr V.l y
Minister Reid procured the present teachers a
small allowance for a continuance of the
which, if the country was unable to payfSS
have been withdrawn, but to offer ediicati!?
and respectable ladies and gentlemen a miserable
pittance, at which even a knock-kneed blackf«n
would turn up his nose with contempt and to
hedge this pittance round with as many protecting
clauses ns if the parties interested were so many
monte-players at Randwick, is nothing short of a
insult, and speaks but little tor the
intelligence of a Minister who could endorse such
proceedings by countenancing the circular to
which is affixed the almighty signature of a party
by the name of Johnson.

AYER’S
Hair Vigor
restores, with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may be darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled; it contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mr. C. P. Bricher writes from Kirby, O..
July 3, 1883 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time I became
nearly bald. 1 used part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. I
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation 1 should have been
eutirelybald.”
J. W. Bowen, proprietor of the McArthur
{Ohio) Enquirer , says ; “AYER’S Hair Vigor
Is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
1 speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sur-e cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.”
Mr. Angus FAiunAiRN, leader of the
celebrated “ Fairbairn Family” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Eeb. 6,
1880 ; “Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayer’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness —a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. 0. A. Prescott, writing frcm 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and ! was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer’s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell, I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
We have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value.

Dear Sir,-
I cheerfully add my testimony to the (rood
efiects deriveable from the use of ST. JACOBS
OIL as demonstrated in my own household. Some
few weeks ago my wife suffered severely from
pains in her head. She applied the Oil with excel-
lent results, and has since recommended it to a
friend for a case of swelling in the legs, in which
case the result was equally beneficial. It has been
used by members of my family, and its action has
satisfied my most sanguine expectations. I con-
sider it a most valuable preparation to have by
you for any household accident. I recommend ft
confidently to my friends, and am thoroughly
satisfied “It Conquers Pain.”
I remain, yours truly,
DAVID CURTIN.
(This testimonial is from a highly respected em-
ploy 6 in the employ of Messrs. A. Hordern and
Sons, and bears the endorsement of that colossal
firm).

“We are about to celebrate our golden
wedding,” wrote a Hungarian clergyman of
seventy, “ but we assure our friends we expect no
presents beyond, say, a ton or two of flour, some
Bavarian beer, a barrel or so of wine, and a bit of
landed freehold. We are happy enough as we are;
and do not wish to have our thoughts drawn off to
the pomps and vanities of this world.”
How much lower down, asks a cynic, will
the Salvation Barnum play religion ? The other
day a big cart drove about an English town with
a band in it and a banner, and bills were flung
about announcing a Salvation tea of “ham, jam.
and glory, 9d a head.” Outside the place where the
ham and hallelujah went on, there was a bill ex-
hibited—“ Com® and see the man who was snatched
from the jaws of hell in his nightcap.”
Scene in a Life on the Ocean Wave up
North Saloon passenger, with enough lather on
his face to fill a barber’s pot: "Stew-ward! Stew-

“ Fetch me a towel, biarst y’, fetch mo a towel,

The Rev. C. J. Byng is authority for the
statement that people will know each other in
heaven just as they do on earth. If a man has ten
wives below, he will have ten In heaven, only
“spiritualised.” If this news gets abroad, we
know of some men who would rather risk the kind-
liness of the flames below than venture on a celes-
tial existence. And then, too, think of the poor
devil who dies in debt—what amusement it
will be for him to be chased all over the highlands
of Eternity by half-a-dozen tailors and a landlady
or two, each with an “ itemised ” statement of the
amount duo! No, Mr. Byng.lyou must give us a
more comforting doctrine than that, if you want
us to knock for admittance at the pearly gates.
It may not be generally known (but it is
perfectly true for all that) that a near relative of
one of our dimmycratic Ciceros is the most reli-
able “grub” exterminator this side of the equi-
noctial line. Not long ago. this terror to free-
lunch bars—“Tommy the Wolfer,” he’s called—
was seated ®n a stool in a George-strcet pub. with
some friends, when the talking turned on the gas-
tronomical abilities of the celebrated Mr. BIbby.
“Yah! y’ make me sick,” exclaimed one of the
speakers, by wav of taking a “rise” out of tho
“Wolfer.” "Tell y’what I’ll do. I’ll put up aten
pun’ note that Tommy here, can eat a bullock.”
“Don’t be a fool, man,” whispered Tommy, ex-
citedly, into his admirer’s ear; “no ’un could eat a
bullock; but look here—make it a calf an’ I’ll try
me d dest.”
Rather a good joke in its way comes from
the River Macleay. It appears that at the last
show held up there, a prize was offered for tho best
duck and drake, Muscovy breed. A well-known
telegraph operator sent two magnificent drakes to
compete for the honour, and his better-half pulled
the feathers out of the tail of one of the birds.
Two judges were appointed to preside over this
branch of the show—one of them being a promi-
nent solicitor, who didn’t know enough about
duoks to load a popgun with; and w© may also
remark that the other expert’s acquaintance with
poultry was considerably hampered by limits also.
So it came to pass that, after careful deliberation,
the lightning dodger was awarded the prize, to the
Intense amusement of all the visitors to the show.
And now the very hens on tho Macleay turn up
their noses with contempt as those worthy judges
pass by, and the people demand that in future all
duck contests shall be decided by some approved
medicaljnanfrom Sydney. Quack! quack!
One of the Churches down at South Yarra,
Melbourne, rejoices in the possession of what may
be termed (not to speak irreverently) a "piping
parson,” that is to say, a clergyman with a first-
class tenor voice. Bo, being well aware that the
average parson's vocal organ resembles the raven’s
tar more than the nightingale’s, the South Yarra
divine has recently determined to give hi? flock
the full benefit of this exceptional gift. In a rich,
oily tenor, ho now warbles forth the first verses of
all the psalms and hymns, as solos, while his en-
raptured congregation listen with a sort of we’d-
llke - to - give - you - a - rousing - encore-only - we-
musn’t expression, truly delightful to behold.
The price of the sittings remains at the same old
figure as ever, in spite of the additional attraction,
so the clerical concerts are likely to be pretty
largely attended, when this musical treat has been
more widely advertised. According to latest
rumour, the reverend artist had “consented” to
sing “ Cu jus Animam,” whllejthe elders were walk-
ing around with the plate. It he could only sub-
stitute “Tom Bowling,” or tho “ Bay of Biscay,”
what a collection they might rake in 1
We are awful sorry we made such a deuce
of a mess about South Australia in a par. about the
Corporation of St. Peters som® time back. Fact
is, the holy apostles of the place have a very nice
and luxurious residence, kept up in very mock-
modest style in the neighbourhood, and its re-
moval was only desired by one of the elders much
holier than the other’goody-goodies. The removt 1
was thusly arranged : During several weeks there
was a close watch kept on the premises, and when
the list of distinguished visitors had reached proper
proportions, there were selected one minister, two
soft-goods men, two lawyers, two hard-goods men,
and some other members of the unco guid frater-
nity. There was no bother made about it, but each
received a very prettily-worded missive, that they
would jointly and severally be summoned to appear
at Boddome’s Hal), to prove the disorderly charac-
ter of the house, unless it was removed in a week
—not the house—but the disorderly charad er. The
little matter had to bo done, so the whole lot of
sprlghtlles had to stump up a matter of five ten-
ners each to pay the rent and satisfy the landlord;
but the place was shut up, and this was the modus
operandi.
Premier Stuart has promised to make in-
quiries whether Sunday lectures in theatres are a
breach of the law, and whether or no they can be
put a stop to. The tone of his reply to the arch-
bigot Murray's queries on the subject would seem
to imply that if he can put a stop to these lectures
he will. Mr. Stuart had better proceed warily. If,
by invoking any obsolescent Caroline law, he can
gag the freethought lecturer, and does do so, he
will commit an outrage on liberty of discussion.
He should re-read his J. S. Mill: “ Ttls not the feel-
ing sure of a doctrine, be it what It may, which is
an assumption of infallibility. It is the under-
taking to decide that question for others, without
allowing them to hear what can be said on the con-
trary side. And this pretension is none the less to
be denounced if put forth on the side- of the most
solemn convictions. However positive anyone’s
persuasion may be, not only of the falsity, but of
the immorality and impiety of an opinion, yet, if
in pursuance of that private judgment, though
backed by tho public judgment of his country or
his contemporaries, he prevents the opinion from
being beard in its defence, he assumes Infallibility.
. . . ‘ Deorum injuria} This cures.’ It remains to
be proved that society, or any of its officers, holds
a commission from on high to avenge any sup-
posed offence to Omnipotence, which is not also a
wrong to our fellow-creatures. The notion that it
is one man’s duty that another should be religious
was tho foundation of all the religious persecu-
tions ever perpetrated, and, if admitted, would
fully justify them.” Does Mr. Stuart admit it?
Will he, Parkes-like, assume to avenge supposed
offences to Omnipotence ? Will he, astride of an
obsolete law, pose as Infallible, and play the
inquisitor ? We hope not.
Now that our church congregations are
on the decline and our clergy are forced to play to
a beggarly array of empty benches, we have much
pleasure in drawing the attention of the clergy
and laity to the effect that quite a rousing old
hoist has been given of late to the good cr use in
Nov/ England by the establishment of Hugging
Sociables” in that county for church and mis-
sionary purposes. All the buggers are charged Is.
admission to a largo hall in which teetotal
drinks are briskly peddled in one end, and on a
platform at the other a brass- band discourses
iweet my sic." At present, all the huggm are of the
female persuasion, and these march in duck file
round the hall, and the buggers having selected
their choice, plank down their cash, and step in
and have q uite a parrot-and-monkey time of it with
the happy fair ones selected. The charges are 10
cents to hug any young lady, between 15 and 20,
ten minutes; 15 cents for one between 20 and 30?
25 cents for young widows; 1 dollar to hug another
man’s wife, and 10 cents extra if the man himself
is looking. Old maids run six for a cent; female
lecturers are free and a brandy-smash to the
bugger thrown in, and all reporters are allowed
one from each lot to enable them to write up tho
business, and do justice to the subject. Not a
single inkslinger ever misses one of these shivoos,
end it's fun for the band to watch them go through
the sampling. Some of the smarties throttle al
the fifteen to thirties and tender widows and then
make a wild attempt to skip the premises. Detec-
tion, however, means suspension of their free
ticket, and so the bulk of the pencillers tackle the
tough old chickens first and then take the taste off
their mouths with the lips of the fair fifteens.
Two of these “swarries” would yank a hopelessly
bankrupt cathedral out o£ debt and leave enough

twelve months fly round on the Continong.
The London International and Colonial
Exhibition was opened at the Crystal Palace on
St. George’s Day, the only Australian exhibits
being a few symphonies iu white and seven noc-
turnes in charcoal. The first-named wonders were
represented by a couple of Agent-Generals, the
inevitable Henniker Heaton, and a few other
“no-account” men, and the nocturnes consisted
of a group of the most measley lot of Queensland
niggers that ever peddled one of Her Majesty’s
blankets away for a gill of rum in a ginger-beer
bottle. How ever they held body and soul together
so long is a marvel, for even wh°n they were here,
It took three of the strongest braves to make one
shadow, and it was only by packing the gins in ice
that they could be kept from drying up into dust
and being blown away. Any shortcomings on
their part at the Exhibition was, however, more
than compensated for by the highly - coloured
circus-poster ads., which told in terms calculated
to freeze the blood in the veins of a Sandhurst
•quartz-mine all about! “ the first introduction in
England of the band of seven Australian boome-
rang throwers, consisting of male and female
Queensland black trackers and ranting man-eaters,
the celebrated bushmen from the continent on the
other side. The only captive band of these fero-
cious. treacherous, uncivilised savages, with deep
scars and seams in the torture 1 flesh, and bones
and huge rings thrust through the nose and ears as
ornaments. Veritable bloodthirsty beasts la dis-
torted human form, with but a glimmering of
reason and gift of speech. They will be intro-
duced In their peace, war, kangaroo, emu, and
cockatoo dances, their midnight corrohorees, cast-
ing of the spear, and whirling of the boomerang.
Worth journeying a hundred miles to see these
specimens of the lowestorder of man.” “Ranting
man-eaters ” is good, but so far as the “ferocity of
the blood-thirsty beasts” is concerned, we’re open
to lay 6 to 4 that our hired girl and a mop could
wipe the whole tribe off the face of the earth inside
of ten seconds.
Out, on the back-blocks of the Paroo, the
boys have a real good appreciation of wholesome
fun and practical joking. Just listen to how they
manage H, Amongst the sportive youths on a
station out that way was a quiet, easy-going galoot
who had a particular horror of snakes, and another
of the crowd thought what a lot of fun could be
extracted from him by fixing up a bogus reptile.
The unsuspecting, and we might add, guileless
young man was a right sound sleeper, and one
night, whilst he was “dreaming of home and
mother,” the joker got a large stockwhip and care-
fully colled it around the heck of the somnolent
one in the most approved snake fashion, and waitt d
with patience worthy of a better cause to see the
start it would give him. And it did give him a
start, you bet! The boys had just gone out for a
spell when he awoke, and was fairly paralysed
with horror when he felt what he thought was a
six-foot reptile in such a terrible position. He lay
awake for some time afraid to stir, and when
his mates came in to enjoy tho fun his eye-tialls
were starting from his head and his face blancued
with fright. Then they began to think that they
had carried the joke too far, and gradually assured
the young fellow that the whole affair was only a
lark. “Fine fun, indeed,” quoth the terror-
stricken party, “but It’ll be my turn someday.”
And it was. One day, in his wanderings through
the bush, he happened to come across a healthy
specimen of a tiger snake, so he secured it, and,
determined to pay the previous joker out for his
trouble, he brought it to the hut, and placed it
carefully between the blinkets in the joker’s
bunk. So, when the latter got into bed, the rent! e
and he got very much mixed up together, and ihe
consequence was that the biter got very badly
bitten—so much so, that he stepped out for the
Golden Shore ere twelve short hours had rolled by.
Funny, wasn’t it? Anyhow, the whole affair was
hushed up; but the boys oufcthero have given up
fooling with snakes.
The recent refusal of an Anglican parson
named Edwards to perform service at the funeral
of a Protestant pauper, who had died in hospital
at Townsville (Q.), has had the effect of eliciting
the views of the Bishop of Northern Queensland
on the observance of the order of the burial of the
dead, and the duties of Anglican clergymen to-
wards “stiJs” awaiting burial. His Lordship’s
views are singularly “ mixed,” some of his opinions
being as reasonable as others are absurd and un-
charitable. when Dr. Stanton tells us that the
Anglican burial service is in no sense prayers for
the dead, and that a clergyman can be more use-
fully employed in tending the living than in spend-
ing a lot of time at tho grave of a man dead and
gone to clay, waiting for and reading the burial
service in the presence of an indifferent under-
taker and his assistants, though we may think his
Right Reverence is singularly devoid of kindly
feeling, yet we cannot deny his ideas on the sub-
ject to bo practical. When, however, he goes on
to point out that it is a waste of time for a
clergyman to read the burial service over the
grave of a poor man who has no friends, we
begin to see what the Bishop is aiming at. It is
evidently a mere £ s d. question. As this tho-
roughly business-like Father in God puts it, the
paramount and primary duty of a clergyman is to
those who pay hi n. There you are. From a
pauper “stiff” you can no more extract a burial
fee than you can blood from a stone, ergo ’twouid
be a perfect farce to say a prayer over him.
When, however, your cold “stiff” has warm
friends, and it is possible to make his eternal part-
ing from the world and its vanities the occasion of
their temporal parting with some of its dross, then
there is virtue in the burial service—at least, such
is the Gospel according to Stanton. A bishop of
to-day has no more likeness to an early apostle
than a cauliflower is like any spontaneous pro-
duction of the Held. It has taken some eighteen
centuries to develop the modern prelate, the
secret of the cultivation employed brirg this—
liberal application of the manure of Mammon.
Apropos of “Chinese” Gordon’s religion,
this is the style in which he hits out at things:—
“ Any conversation with so cal.od religious people
on religious subjects is wiih me at an end forever.
I say the Christian Pharisees deny Christ; they
ignore Him, or at most throw Him in as a make-
weight. I see no resemblance to Him in them. A
hard, cruel set they ere, from high to low. You
can form some idea or what Christ was like. Do
you know any single one of Christ's pretended
successors clergymen or Dissenters— who is like
Him ? I am sick of your burnt-offeiln s and your
prayer-meetings. My soul bateth them; they are
a trouble to me; 1 am weary of them.” Gordon,
by the way, believes in the pre-existence of souls.
“ I thick,” he writes, ” that this lile is only one of
a series of lives which our incarnate part has lived.
1 have little doubt of our having pre-existed, and
also, that in the time of our pre-existence, we were
actively employed.” He is also addicted to the
fatalistic creed, singular to relate, as shown
by his expressed sympathy with Mahommedanlsm.
Of the Mussulman hesajs : “I find him quite as
good a Christian as many a Christian. Allot us aro
more or less pagans. I like the Mussulman : he is
not ashamed of his God. His life is a fairly pure
one ; certainly, he gives himself a good margin in
the wife line ; but, at any rate, ho never poaches
on others. Can our Christian people say the
same ?” All of which, wo reckon, wives the pious
nineteenth century Christian, and pretty often
his pastor, too, a nasty jar. Wiring into “ Con-
ventional Christianity,” more especially as prac-
tised by those so-calk d chosen of the Lord, the
English, he writes, “ Act up to your religion, and
then you will enjoy it. 'i he Christianity of the
masses is a vapid, tasteless thing, and of no use t<»
any one. The people of England care more for
their dinners than toey do for anything el°e.”
After this, it wouldn’t be a bad idea for the ortho-
dox to send a few missionaries out Khartoum way
to convert this very straight tongued person. The
notions he has picked up among the Chinese and
Mussulmans are far too advanced and Christian-
like to run the gauntlet of modern orthnduxy.
Pate blue silk and corresponding darned
net give the materials for this graceful,
though simple, evening toilette. Two box-
pleat flounces, four inches deep, border the
skirt, over which falls in front and on each,
side, the darned net tunic, taken up slightly
and headed by closely-pleated crossing scarf
Earls, buttoned to the short basque bodice
efore, and disappearing at the sides under
the folds, out in one with back, these reach-
ing to the hem of the skirt. The neck is cut
square in front and pointed behind. A fichu
hides the close of the bodice, and plain strip
of darned net represents short sleeves.

MRS. JONES NOT ONLY PROTESTED THAT SHI! WAS NOT DOING ANYTHING OF THE
KIND, BUT HAD THE EFFRONTERY TO SUGGEST THAT IF MR. JONES WOULD GO
BACK BEHIND THE SCREEN, SHE AND YOUNG SMITH WOULD PUT THEMSELVES
IN THE SAME POSITION AGAIN. (Ultimately adjusted by Mr. Jones putting himself in Smith’s
place, and satisfying himself that Smith had not been putting himself in his (Jones') place).
An uncommon effect is given to the
favourite double-breasted jacket body, as
shown above, by leaving the neck part open,
and from which falls a rich frill of wide lace.
If the dress material is of fine navy serge,
and turned back with pale bine silk, a pure
white lace looks extremely well If, however,
the material is of a brown shade, cream lace
would be more suitable.
