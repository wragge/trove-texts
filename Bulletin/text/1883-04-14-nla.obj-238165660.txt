a mass of confusion) show, he didn’t realize
anythin* like a quarter of a million out of the
■£447,751 assets which insolvents had put in their
schedules. All ho owned to getting hold of was
£249,958. And he charged (as expenses and deduc-
tions in realizing this amount) .£18,262, besides
.£5194 hie own remuneration. There remained,
therefore, for creditors of .£625,380 the magnificem
sum of £325,499 ! This is to say, that a creditor
would, by recourse to the legalized machinery ol
the insolvency laws as conducted by this splendic
officer under the protecting wing of the Supreme
Court of Justice, have received from a debtor
who asserts ho could pay £330 in the £3100,
£33 15a. for a proved claim of £3100. A creditor tc
the tune of £31000 would recover £337 10a. The
expenses incurred by this officer of the Court to
place the £33 15s. in the hands of the £3100 creditor
were about £33 more, of which the assignee was
entitled to about 17a. 6d. Now, as a creditor
ordinarily employs his own lawyer or agent to look
after his claims in an insolvent estate, each creditor
of .£100 may reasonably be regarded as having had
a little bill for legal services, commission, and
collection, quite up to £3 15s. So that on the
average, while insolvent estates were scheduled to
yield £80 of assets to the £100 of liabilities, only
about £6 15s. of this £80 was accounted for by
the late Mr. Sempill. It cost £3 to collect that
£6 15a. and to pay him hia lawful dues, and left
the creditor £3 15s. to pay hia expenses in passing
his claim, and to put in hia pocket as salvage from
the wreck. And this, to quote Mr. Griffiths’
words, “ had bean going on day after day and year
after year from 1861 to 1880, or about twenty
years!”
• • •
But, our readers will perhaps say to themselves,
this is all pastand gone The swindler Sempill
has expiated his crimes by taking his life, and as
to the countenance which he received from the
Judges of the Supreme Court in his resistance to
examination of his accounts, and possibly to
reform of hia methods, the Judges merely
administered the law as they found it. They
were deceived also, perhaps, by a plausible
and fair-seeming man, whose twenty years of
office had been unruffled by any circumstance
which might have raised a question as to his
It is a positive misfortune to the country th
there is only one daily paper in the metropo
which even pretends to report in detail the c
bates in the Legislature The information whio
roaches the public on these important diaoussio
is all filtered through one medium, and comas on
curdled by the transit. The relative importan
of matters discussed is often inverted by t
simple process of suppressing significant speech
or eliminating the most telling elements fro
them, and by giving a spurious prominence
other speeches or passages not really of anythin
like equal moment. This has been fully exemp
fied by a comparison of the Hansard report o:
the disousaien respecting the defalcations of tl
late official assignee, Mr. Sempill. In th
Herald’s report the most striking arraig
>;nenta of particular persons and officials,
.directly responsible for S5o wholesale stealings
are so softened down that their fore
•and emphasis almost entirely disappear, and tl
.deductions which would naturally arise in tl
mind of every intelligent man who reads the fa
account of the speeches as delivered are neoessari
stifled. Now, here is a history of the whole affai
drawn from the Hansard report of the debate
and we venture to affirm that the salient facts o
this narrative will give a shook of surprise t
people who read the Herald’s report, and hav
regularly perused ita loading columns ever since.
• mm
Some years ago rumours were current aff aotin
the management of certain estates placed in th
hands of official assignees. After considerabl
pressure had been brought to bear upon them, th
Government appointed an officer to inquire int
the matter. Mr. Sempill peremptorily refusec
to allow any officer of the Government to examin
his books. It was discovered that under th
Audit Act no one could make an inquiry into th
accounts of official assignees, inasmuch as thos
■officers were under the jurisdiction of the Suprom
Court. But, being threatened by the Govern
tnent with suspension—apparently an exoelleu
stretch of authority by the Government—
Mr. Sempill yielded, and on the appointee
day, when the Treasury officer went to
inspect Mr. Sempill’s books, he learned tha
that gentleman had been found dead in his bee
that very morning. The inspection of accounts
proceeded, and resulted in disclosures which are
perfectly astounding. The Chief Commissioner ir
Insolvency had made repeated efforts to compe
Mr. Sempill to fils accounts. Bat as to do so
would have been simple justice to creditors and the
public generally, Mr. Sempill, with well grouudec
confidence, appealed to the Supreme Court of Law
to prevent a consummation so opposed to its prac-
tice. Mr. Neville Griffiths, in dealing with
the matter in the Assembly, on March 20, men-
tioned three of the instances in which Mr.
Sempill thus sheltered his sooundrelism behind
the handy shelter cf the Supreme Court Two
instances occurred in March, 1871, and in each
case a prohibition was granted against the inquisi-
tive Chief Commissioner—the costs being paid, we
presume, out of the estate —that is to say, by the
unlucky creditors. Again, on the 8th of Decem-
ber, 1880, the Chief Commissioner ordered Mr.
Sempill to file proper accounts in re Wilkin-
son Brothers, and to repay money taken by him
and used without assessment. Mr. Sempill
simply snapped his fingers at the Chief Commis-
sioner and appealed to the Supreme Court, which
rescinded the order.
• • •
How the commercial public had fared at the
hands of this prot<5?6 of the Supreme Court may
be gathered from the posthumous report of Mr.
Selwvn Smith, after Mr. Sempill’s suicide.
Prom January, 1876, to December, 1880, Sem-
pill had been entrusted with 1093 accounts,
representing over thirteen thousand creditors.
Of these, only three thousand odd thought it
worth while to prove their debts at all, onoo the
estate had got into the olutohes of Sempill —a
pretty striking illustration of the opinion which
business people generally had formed of their
ohanoe of getting anything when a Chief Justice’s
nominee and prot6g6 had got hold of an estate.
And further investigation shows that the bulk of
the ereditors had reason. According to the sworn
testimony of the insolvents, their liabilities
amounted to .£625,380, and their assets to
.J5447,751. Of course allowance must be made fot
magnificence of insolvents’ ideas of the value
•nf tbeir assets. But even making the most sweep-
ing deductions, and reducing the ,£447,751 of
Alleged assets to <£250,000, surely a quarter of a
■million sterling of other people’s money was a
iSfood deal to pass, during four years, through the
bands of a person relieved by the highest
dispensers of justice from the necessity of
submitting his accounts to audit. But so
-fat as Sempill’s accounts (found to be
qualification for his responsible duties. This
assumption is, unfortunately, not tenable. Mr.
Sempill was suspended in 1874, having had the
indiscretion to become himself a sort of amateur
casual in the insolvency line. In short, Mr. Sem-
piLii himself filed -his schedule, which should be
an interesting document. We have, unfortu-
nate’y, no information as to its nature, or as to
who was the ofhoial assignee of the official assig-
nee; with whom he was associated in speonlation ;
or what his creditors got. Sat we have Mr.
Griffiths’ unooatradioted statement that, after
having been a year suspended, and insolvent, Mr.
k, empilii was re-appointed to his position by Hia
Honor the Chief Justice.
• • •
The axiom, “ set an insolvent to catch an insol-
vent.” appears to have quite taken possession of
Sir James Martin’s faculties. When the late
Mr.ALPRKD Sandeman, another official assignee,
“*e other day, also leaving a deficiency of
.£-000 to <£3000 to lament its sad bereavement, Sir
James, seemingly in pursuance of this admirable
maxim, appointed as hia successor, according to
Mr. Griffiths, “ a person who, in 1874. passed
through the Insolvency Court, and whose certifi-
cate was suspended for eight months for
unfair dealing and malversation of funds.”
1 hen—-we again quote— l< another recent appoint-
ment is that of a young man, son of a former
member of Parliament, of whom I will say
nothing further than that he has not yet received
hia insolvent’s _ certificate. This young man
was a clerk in a _ bank when he was ap-
pointed to the position, which, I gather from
the information before us, is worth about ,£1000
m ear ‘” seems too modest an estimate.
The same state of things as to the absence
of control continues to the present time.
The official assignees have simply to file
quarterly accounts, which there is no officer
to check and verify; they draw money on their
own account out of the Treasury, and they pay
what dividend they please to the creditors.” !
We need scarcely inform our readers that the
young man referred to is a son of the celebrated
George Alfred Lloyd, lately M.P. for New-
castle, and equally renowned as a shining
light of the Pitt-street Congregational Church
and as a financial genius Mr. Llotd,
junior, brought from his bank an unblemished
character, and will no doubt maintain it as an
official assignee. But there seems to have been
no special reason why he, rather than any other
respectable bank clerk, should have been pitch-
forked into his present position. In any
case that fortunate young man may be con-
gratulated upon his removal from a bank clerk-
alnp t° the post of official assignee. In the latter
position, even so severe a censor as Mr. Griffiths
passes lightly over such a trifle as an “ antioipa-
Sandbmah, to the tune of
jfi-OOO to <£3000—between two and three years’
salary, according to his own estimate, just quoted.
Mr. Griffiths remarked that perhaps the official
assignee had a right to do that. If so, how muc
more pleasant a position is this than that of
bank clerk, who is certain to be put on his tria
for embezzlement if he “ anticipates ” so much a
a month’s salary from the cash entrusted to him
and who, moreoter, is not in any way entitled tc
look to the Chief Justice for protection anc
countenance in the form of an injunction to
restrain any prying manager or accountant who
may be so unreasonable as to require him to
balance his aceounts and the cash in his hands.
• • »
Mr. Griffiths, with all his desire for an altera-
tion of the system which has worked so remark-
ably, must have a strain of sangniineness in his
temperament. He apprehends little for the
future, because, considering that some officia
assignees—probably Messrs. Edward Knox,
J. P. Mackenzie, and Mr. Humphert, who are
mentioned as honourable men—had readily sub-
mitted their accounts to audit when requested, he
doesn’t see how the present holders of the posi-
tions could refuse. This is not very conclusive,
and Mr. Griffiths evidently felt it was not, for
he continues that were the official assignees to
refuse, the Chief Justice could be applied to, to
compel them to submit. Considering that the
Chief Justice, or the Supreme Court, had been
appealed to under identical circumstances in the
case ©f Mr. Sempill, and had granted an injunc-
tion to restrain people from troubling that officer
with impertinent scrutinies, Mr. Griffiths’
assumption that the decision would be other-
wise now, seems to convey a sort of imputation
upon the Judges. The Supteme Court Judges
merely administer the law as they find it.
They do not relax or vary it to oblige a friend or
business associate. The rights which Mr. Sem-
pild enjoyed are of course not attributable to any
personal relations which may have subsisted
between him and any Judge. They were his
rights as an official assignee ; and, while the law
remains the same, every official assignee has the
same rights, although his name be other than
Sempill, his partners in speculation different
men, and although ho may not have been nursed
through an insolvency and reinstated by the Court
as soon as ho had got through that complaint. Noth-
ing is altered, except that the public has had its
eyes opened now, despite the pleasantly tender
manner in whish the Herald skimmed over the
subject. And there seems every likelihood that
nothing will be altered till some future official
assignee is obliging enough to poison himself, j he
matter is shelved for this session, Mr Griffiths
having been coaxed to withdraw his motion calling
for a formal inquiry.
• • •
As to the hopes of any disciplinary measure
next session, we have only to mention that the
Minister for Justice was moved by the above faets
to the point of admitting that they disclosed a
state of things that is “highly objectionable.”
Mr. Cohen must have made the Herald his
Gamaliel, When his soul is most deeply stirred
by disclosures of stupendous iniquities, he is quite
equal to the Herald in the tempestuous character
of his epithets. “Highly objectionable” is a
phrase which harmonises beautifully with the
Herald’s groan of “unbecoming.” Meanwhile
men of business may continue assured of recover-
ing an average of .£3 15s. for every .£80 which
any involved debtor may place in the hands of an
official assignee for realization and apportionment
—always provided that they wait long enough and
trust implicitly in the high stamp of men hitherto
selected by His Honor the Chief Justice to handle
the moneys. Meanwhile the propriety of in-
creasing Sir James Martin’s salary and pension
nust be apparent to the most inappreoiative—
lawyer.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
Dibbs and the Cable.
There are points of Constitutional practice in conned*
tion with cabling to England a Treasurer's financial
I statement which deserve attention. We are not aware
when the custom originated, but wo do know that it is
one which the ex-Treasurer, Mr. Watson, regularly
resorted to. It is to te noted, however, that the Con-
stitutional aspects of the matter were not at all
referred to in the discussion with reference to.th
expenditure by Mr, Dibbs of over £1300 public moneys
in cabling home his Budget speech. The whole pur-
port of the criticisms t® which the Treasurer
was subjected was that the sum was very
heavy. There was this exception, that one mem.
ber said something about unauthorised expen.
diture. Taking the mere business aspect of the affair,
however, as the speakers generally did, the objections
urged were certainly very feeble, and in several in-
stances founded upon an ignorant vanity. Mr. Dibbs
explained, without mincing matters, that he had con-
sidered the publication of the speech would bo a good
advertisement for the colony. This view was con-
demned on various grounds; as sordid, as extravagant,
and by Mr. Pioott as absurd. Mr. Pioott’s contention

was that this great colony is too well known to nee
advertising-. The bon. gentleman need only travel to
any one ot the world’s great capitals, and when
there use his powers of induction, to learn that
New South Wales is politically and financially a
very insignificant place, indeed. Why, even Bolivia
owes more money to English capitalists than does New
South Wales Every day mortifying evidence crops
up, showing that even in the mother country one
Australian colony is scarcely distinguished from
another. It happened but a few weeks before Mr
Dibbs’ Budget speech was delivered, that there was
published by the 8. M. Herald an article from the
London Times, in which a deliberate endeavour was
made to decry Australian colonial loans ns safe invest-
monts. Now, our colony must appear shortly in the
London market as a borrower. This was foreseen —
admitted before Mr Dibbs came to ofiice. The effect
of the Times’ representations, if allowed to go unoou.
tradicled, would have been probably to lower the tender-
in? price for our next loan. Perhaps only a fraction per
cent. But a fraction per cent, may mounttoatremendous
sum when taken from two or three millions sterling
One-half per cent, on two millions represents £10,000.
Mr. Dibbs’ speech constituted a crushing exposure of
the falsity of the Times article, so far as N.3. Wales is
concerned. But to procure its admission into the
Times would not ho easy by ordinary methods. In
the great world, which has its centre in London, oven
an Agcnt-Qoneral is a very small person. We have
seen solemn communication by Agents-General on
subjects of vital importance to the Colonies, squeezed
into an obscure corner of an inside page of the Times,
' in its smallest type, while a mob row in Khiva, or the
murder ot a janissary in Macedonia, was prominently
displayed in bold type in the best pages. To
have secured insertion in the Times alone, of the
Budget speech, either on its merits and import-
ance, or as a special advertisement to he placed
among the reading matter, would have been equally
impossible. Twice £1300 would not have se-
cured such a privilege. But, by_ having it accepted
here as one of Eedter’s messages, all difficulties were
averted, and immense prominence secured not only in
the Times but in all the other leading London news-
papers, and in scores of the principal newspapers
throughout Great Britain. Begarded as an advertise-
ment, the insertion thus secured could not have been
purchased for ten times £1300. As a business transac-
tion, therefore, the course adopted by the Treasurer
was unexceptionable. When contrasted with the
amounts hitherto expended by the Treasury in this
way, Mr. Din ns’ outlay was certainly largo. But Sir
John Kobrutson grossly exaggerated the discrepancy
when he said that £70 or £80 had previously
been the limit. Mr. Watson spent on one
message between £250 and £*500. The amount
however, can scarcely affect the principle. Eeuteb’s
agent here would refute to forward any message, or any
portion of a message, which embodied expressions of
opinion not recorded in the speech or the debate, or
any generalisation which-the tone of the debate did not
warrant beyond the possibility of cavil. To lot any-
thing foreign to a record of public utterances and
patent facts intrude communications would be
more than his position;, Tjrould bo worth. The interests
ot fair-play are thus protected, and it is difficult to see
on what solid grounds objection can be maintained
against the Treasurer’s outlay in this instance. Mr
Dibbs has only spent, in the most splendid newspaper
advertisement the colony ever had, part of the amount
which, had the I’abkes Government been in office,
would have been pocketed by the unhappy owners of
that journalistic frost, the Stdnet Dailt Telegravh.
Lot us console ourselves for the Treasurer’s big cable
expenditure with the reflection that the £1300 has been
spent iu advertising with the London Daily Teleorath
instead.
Bubble and Squeak.
The objection taken by Mr. Taylor to the further
progress of the Criminal Haw Amendment Bill, was,
according to our lights, and with all respect for the
opinions of the Speaker and of the Attorney.Ganeral, a
good objection. That is to say, technically good. We
believe that, had the Speaker adhered to the strict line
of Parliamentary procedure, and allowed his mind to he
less swayed by considerations of expediency, he would
have ruled in favour of Mr. Taylor’s objection—and
thereby have inflicted considerable injury upon the
community. The whole business was trumpery—the
clause, the objection, and the debate. Everybody
engaged in the discussion was playing comedy in a high
tragedy manner. The members of the Government were
endeavouring to deny that any principle was involved,
although they must have felt that literally there was a
principle—that is to say, the fag-end of a principle-
involved. On the other hand, Mr. Taylor, Sir Henry
Parkes, and others of the Opposition, who discovered
the microscopic fraction of principle and enlarged upon
it, must have been conscious that their pretence of
patriotic anxiety to preserve the tights and privileges
of the Assembly was arrant humbug, and, worse still,
transparent humbug. As a matter of fact, not one felt
the slightest apprehtnsiou for the rights of the
Assembly. There had been no attack—there could
be none —for there were no assailants. The Consti-
tution was not in the slightest danger, and its
gallant defenders knew it was in no peril. All
the pomp and circumstance of the desperate re-
sistance they offered served but to call up the image
of Mr. Snodorahs taking off his coat and making
desperate demonstrations of readiness to flght a very
small boy, or to suggest the demeanour of the bluster-
ing hero who marches out to the held of honour, loudly
declaring his resolution to give his life for some lovely
being, fortified by the knowledge that the seconds
have arranged to draw the bullets from the pistols to
. be used on the occasion fcir Henry Parkes, in parti-
cular, made an ignoble exhibition of himself, by lashing
himself into a paroxysm of virtuously patriotic blather,
well knowing that to do so involved no risk and
demanded no sacrifice, unless the sacrifice of his very
. threadbare consistency bo regarded as a merit. The
country would do well to regard with profound distrust
man who make heroic demonstrations when there is no
danger. All experience teaches that these are the very
sort of men who turn out to be either arrant cowards or
traitors when the real ordeal presents itself.
It is the wordy orator who foams patriotic sentiments
nt the mouth, so long as to do so redounds to his dis-
tinotion and advantage, who is the first to creep under a
gun, or skulk behind a.curtain, the moment patriotism
involves risk or discomfort.
The Evening News is still engaged in “makiu* it hot”
for the Ministry, which refused to accept young
Bennett'b old proWgd as n colleague. And as Aurtuti)
is nob clever, he is making a dreadful moos of it; and in
endeavouring to make it hot for tho men who slighted
his preposterous pretensions and snubbed his ridiculous
vanity, he is woefully burning his own fingers. The
contortions which he permits the public to perceive,
though the transparent articles in his paper, provoke
indeed a good deal of amusement, and no doubt help
to sell several penn’orths. But tho entertainment
is, despite the additional pennies, given alto-
gether at his own expense. Of course he
doesn’t know it, ani won’t believe it. He is
surrounded by crafty men, his superiors in age*
and altogether his r asters in respect to knowingness.
These work their cwn little games, and persuade their
companion that he is a prodigiously smart fellow, and
quite a power in the State. Aud then they got into
corners and snigger, or go into the street and gurgle.
The latest dodge has been to fill Alf. up with the
legend that Sir John Robertson is going to join the
Ministry. And the innocent, without a suspicion, and
fullcf the idea that he is "making it hot ” again, goes
and shoves it into his paper, and elicits from the public
a mighty guffaw, only rivalled by the screech which
greeted the “ Alarmiug Humour,” which some wag
seduced Alfred into printing, that the Land Leaguers
had cut the submarine cable—at Banjoewangie. The
loveliest aspect of the joke is, however, that after
Alfred has chewed over this item of information, that
luckless paper, the Daily Telegraph, picks it up and
adopts it with quite the fashionable and sagacious air
of a black gin smoking the stump of the cigqr a larri-
kin has done with.
The mind of the lawyer is fearfully and wonderfully
constituted. When, last month, in the Assembly, Mr.
Taylor proposed an amendment to the Criminal Law
Amendment Bill which would have had the effect of
allowing attorneys to appear and plead for clients in
the Supreme Court, only two attorneys, and one of
them not engaged in court practice, were impressed
with the force of Mr. Taylor’s arguments. On
the other hand, not a single barrister hnt discovered a
dangerous fallacy. Thus it came to pass, that, when
Hou.'e divided, tho following barristers were moved by
conscientious convictions to resist the proposal:—
Buchanan, Cohen, O’Mara, Eeid, Bruce Smith, Wis-
dom, and Stephen ; whereas net a single barrister was
numbered among the twenty-one who divided in favour
of the motion. The same peculiarity is noticeable
whenever the interests of the public are asserted to
clash with some privilege enjoyed by the profession. If
tho matter came to a division in Parliament, the con"
sciences of barristers and attorneys are moved with
identical scruples. They unite ea one man to protect
the public—from innovations. Now, we hold that
innovations, although sometimes risky things to deal
with, are not halt so dangerous as lawyers, who are
alirays disastrous to the public.
It is really to bo hoped that some oue among tho City
members will prevent the Australian Gaslight Com-
pany’s Bid from passing into law in its present pro-
posteroui form. We say again that, instead of a Bill
to increase the powers of this oppressive and plunder-
ing monopoly, there should be one to cut its comb.
Conceive that as high or higher price should be de-
manded in Sydney as in Melbourne, six hundred miles
further distant from coal supply; and conceive that
the public have no remedy, no alternative, no escape.
There is no possibility of competition, for such license
as is enjoyed by the present Company no other Com-
pany can ever hope to enjoy. If a citizen doesn’t con-
sider the gas good in quality or the price fair, he can’t
nuy it elsewhere He may go without—if ho can. A shop-
keeper can’t To substitute kerosene would quadruple his
insurances, and spoil the effect of his window display.
In England, as;Mr. Stuart remarked in the Legislative
Assembly the other day, no Gas Bill could bo obtained
without a guarantee that when the profits rose above
ten per cent, the charge for gas should be reduced.
What the profits of the Australian Gas Company have
been is only known to the shareholders. They have
served, anyhow, to provide enormous extensions of
plant without till to-day involving a call or suspending
on a single occasion the division of profits, and the
apportionment of bonuses. There can be no reason to
hurry through a Bill to increase the powers of the
company which would not apply with tenfold force to
the propriety of pushing through a Bill to protect the
public from plunderers.
The Organs of the English People.
In commenting lately upon the strictures of a
critic, we adverted to the fact that people who
form their impressions respecting the opinions of
the people of Great Britain from the letters by
correspondents of the Herald, or from the ex-
tracts from English papers which are published
by that and other daily journals, are permitting
themselves to be misled. The papers quoted are
invariably either the chief London dailies, or such
weeklies as the Saturday Review, Vanity
Pair, Whitehall Review, World, and so
forth. Now, not one of these is a people’s paper.
The masses don’t subscribe to daily papers as a
rule. For the most part, oven pennies have ap-
preciable value to the British workman. He has
organs of his own—penny weeklies —which furnish
him with a compendium of the news for Sunday’s
reading, and which provide him with comment
and guidance to his taste. These are the organs
of the people of England, and anyone who desires
to know what views meet with the approval of
the masses, towards whom political power is
rapidly gravitating, must study these papers.
The Times has no significance as regards the
actual “Commons” of. England. It represents
the plutocratic ideal. It is notorious that the
Times has no political principles. It generally
manages to stand in with the Government for the
time being. The Times has, however, distinct
commercial and economic policies. It is the
champion of the “haves” against the “have
notsand in all its aberrations from Whig to
Tory, that key-note is never departed from. The
Times affects to speak for the people, truly, but it
speaks really for the people who have a thousand
a year income or ten thousand pounds’ worth of
capital or estate. The Daily Telegraph,
again, ministers to the middle and burgher class.
It is more liberal than the Times, but reflects the
timidity and snobbish deference of its patrons.
The Daily News is bolder, bat still not a
people’s paper ; while the other penny dailies more
than equally fail to secure the support of the
proletariat. A comparison of figures will serve to
make the distinction very clear. The Times
claims to issue 103,000 copies daily. This is
probably an over-statement of its circulation ; and
as a more considerable portion of its issue goes
abroad than of any other daily, the domestic or
home circle of readers is comparatively restricted.
The Daily Tklegrap h turns out 250,000, dally,
the Standard 192,000, the Daily News 160,000,
the Morning Post 10,000. The rest of the
London dailies are not worth noticing in respect
to circulation. Now to come to the weeklies:
Lloyd's Newspaper circulates 613,000 —nearly
equalling the combined circulation of all the
above-mentioned dailies. Reynolds’s News,
paper turns out 300,000. The Budget issues
300,000, the News of the World 85,000. and
the Dispatch 220,000. These are the people’s
papers. Their combined circulation is over a
million and a half each issue ; and when one takes
them up, one is at once in a different world from
that which presents itself on perusal of the Times
and penny dailies. All these papers are “ Ad-
vanced Liberal” at the mildest, and moat of them
are pronouncedly Radical in their tone.
* * ♦
In order that the readers of The Bulletin may
be placed in a better position to judge of the drift
of public opinion in England we give some ex-
tracts from Reynolds’, Lloyd's, the Dispatch,
and the News of the World, the tone of which
may be usefully compared with the extracts from
the organs of property and snobbism, which are
exclusively served up by the S.M. Herald as
representing the opinions of the “ people” of
England. Our extracts are from issues of Feb.
5th and 11th ; —
Mr. Chamberlain .was correct in saying at Swansea
that “ the Anarchists of France and tbo Nihilists of
Russia and the Fenians of Ireland have vary few sym-
pathisers in this country," and in giving as the reason
for this happy state of things that “we Radicals do
not think it our business to upset the coach every time
the pace does not come up to our expectations.Eat
soma of us, whether Radicals or not, and however
foolish it may bo, object to coaches standing still for
ever, or only going in the wrong directions. So it is
with the Skye crofters, who certainly are not Badicils
or revolutionists, but whose aristocratic enemies would
like to brand them as worse than Fenians. Londoners,
somehow, cannot feel a, very lively interest in the for-
tunes and misfortunes of these islanders of the Western
Hebrides, and the struggle they have been maintaining
for a long time past attracts lets attention than a riot
in Afghanistan or Capo Colony. The struggle is an
important one, however, and well worth watching.
The fight that these crofters are carrying on with
their tyrannical proprietors, ard already apparently
with a fair measure of success", is an echo of the fight
in which the Irish farmers arc defeating their oppres-
sors, and a prelude to the tight that must soon arise
between the needy cultivators and the greedy land-
lords to the (south as well as North of the Tweed.
• • •
We are informed that the Prince of Wales visited the
great gambling hell of Moate Carlo the other day, and
that ho not only gambled, but that, he lort persistently.
Now that the Princess of Wales has forbade her husband
to shoot pigeons, the geod fellow finds gambling a little
relief to the monotony of existence. Our national
hypocrisy would not tolerate tho open encouragement
of a gambling den in Englend by a member of tke reign-
ing dynastry; but when the Englishman crosses the
Channel, ho shows how vulgar and unconventional ho
can be. He discards his chimney-pit hat and his good
manners : he gambles, and ho visit* picture galleries on
Sundays. He renounces his “ plain joint" for dinners
©f seven courses ; although, when he returns homo, ho
considers himself at liberty to abuse foreign cookery
and foreign hotels, both of which are better and cheaper
than what he obtains at home. The Grand Old Man at
the Carnival, and Mr. Gladstone reading tho prayers at
Hawarden Church; tho Piince of Wales at Monte
CarM, and the same individual painfully trying to be
outwardly straightlaoed in deference to English preju-
dice, are among those happy and anomalous contrasts
with which the life of this country pre-eminently
abounds.
• • •
English rnle in Ireland in the nineteenth century is
represented by the imprisonment and State prosecution
of Mr. Parnell, M. P.. Mr. Dillon, M.P., Mr. Sexton,
IMP., Mr. Biggar, M.P, Mr. O'Brien, M.P., Mr.
Healy, M.P,, Mr. Gray, MP., Mr O'Sullivan, M P.,
Mr. O’Connor Power, M P., Mr O'Kelly, M.P., and Mr.
Davitt, who was elected a member, but was not allowed
to tit. Now these are the most popular men in Ireland,
and yet, with admirable hypocrisy, we talk of our bene-
l floial Government of that country. "We ought not,"
i said Charles James Fox, speaking of Ireland, “ to pre-
» name to legislate for a nation in whose feelings and
| b if actions, wants and interests, opinions and prejudices,
| we have no sympathy."
9 • •
At Dover, a town generally considered as prosperous,
we rend of four hundred working men complaining to
the Mayor that they were absolutely starving, and
could not obtain work! And one of the number of these
unfortunates, whose wife and children were dying of
starvation, having stolen a piece of meat valued at two
shillings, was duly imprisoned 1 Yet, whilst suah
scenes as these are of d uly occurrence, and the dis-
tress throughout the country is fast increasing, we are
told that almost immediately after the meeting of
Parliament the list ef high-class paupers will be in-
creased in tho persons of l ords Wolseley and Alcester,
who are each to receive £50,000—the one for knocking
down a few trumpery forts, and the other for dispersing
a mob of tatterdemalions who ottered but a mere show
ef resistance to tbo overwhelming and disciplined foicc
set against them 1
• « •
The people must not inquire as to how they have
been robbed by the aristocracy in collusion with the
clergy, for as Lord Granville smugly declared when dis-
coursing ou tho rights of property, bygones wore
bygones. Tbo thief in the dock might also suggest a
like coarse; but 1 suspect the suggestion would not ho
entertained by judge or jury.
• * •
Mr. Courtney admits that all tbo justice which has
yet been granted to Ireland has been forced out of an
unwilling English Legislature. We are bound humbly
to confess that this is so; and we should resolve,
following Mr. Courtney's advice, to have this no longer
on our conscience. He says:—“The Liberals of Eng-
land have a great responsibility if they do not force
their members to be just to Ireland without waiting
for Irish rebellions.”
• • •
And it is idle talk to tell us that wo, the advanced
posts, are trying to rouse the masses. It is the last
thing wo are doing. We are trying to rouse the rich,
to rouse the wealthy, to rouse the legislature, to avert
a crisis which all see looming perilously near, Man
with man, wo are all proud of England. The belted
earl cannot hold this green land of ours dearer thau do
we, and we as a class spend upon it more money in pro-
portion, and shea our blood in battles far oftoner, than
docii either he or his fellows.

Extract from the Continental Gazette,
Paris.
The most surprising triumph for an American product
at the Paris Exhibition was the success of £. Anheuser
& Co.’s Brewing Association of St. Louis, which
eelipsed Bass, Barclay and Perkins, Alsop A Guinness,
the world-renowned English brewers, as well as hun-
dreds of rivals from Austria and Bavaria. It is not.
surprising that a great sensation was produced when It
was understood that the experts reluctantly pro-
nounced the St, Louis beer ” superior to any malt
liqnor ever drank upon the continent,’’ and that all
Paris is now seeking to quail the American nectar.

Why is New South Wales so behind in this particular
industry ? Wo do not Know; no one appears tiknowl
One thing certain, no timber appears to be much used
but cedar. How is this ? Have we no woods in our
colony suitable? This is just what wa are trying to
find out, and with thiS'in view wa are oiljring a prize of
£20 for the best descriptive essay upon tho woods i t
New South Wales. At oor Factory wa have been mak-
ing Walnut, American Walnut, but why should we use
Foreign Timber when wo doubtless have useful and
valuable wood growing in our own colony ? Wo have
given publicity to the notice of this Prize Essay silica

A New York theatrical paper of January last
describes the departure of someboly now in Aus-
tralia: " Jnst as the moment of the sailing arrived, an
express waggon, containing an old man attired in an
nlster and goggles, appeared on the wharf, boarded the
ship, and secured passage for Australia under the name
of Shapscole The ship had not been a day out when it
was discovered that old man Shapscote was — in
disguise." The injured husband, it is stated, has since
had his redress in the Courts. In other words, the lady
whom Mr. *• Shapscote" joined has been divorced.
On the 15th March, a well-known New Zealand
artist died. John Cnlder was a Scotchman; in his
youth pupil to an artist, and came out to Ballarat with
the first rush Ho made money and lost it afterwards
on the Thames field. Ho only painted intermittentlv,
but with considerable skill, his forte being landscape,
and ho was the last survivor of a small coterie of artists
who have all gone before him "over the range " Over
twenty years ago, John Calder was a splendid swords-
man, runner, and boxer; indeed, one of the foremost
athletes of Victoria in the days when sport was a
matter more of honour than lucre.
Everyone knows J. S. Batters, the man who.
two years ago, wrote in the A sous about Sydney, and
who, two months ago, gained additional notoriety as
“ secretary " of the committee which spent £3000 or
bo in returning Mr. Surgeon Baaney to Parliament.
Apropos, Baaney last week entertained his committee
(400 of them) at a dinner, intended to celebrate the
successful issue of their labours, so it's very hard to
say whit the total of his election expenses may bo.
Well, nobody knows whether Batters—he was Mayor
of Melbourne when Prince Alfred visited uj, and the
Prince used to say, every morning, “ O Lord, give us
this day our daily bread without oar Batters ” —is
English, Irish, or Scotch Thirty years ago he used to
attend the Preib.vteriin Church; tan years later he was
a Pillar of St. John’s Anglican Church, Toorak; in
Fiji he was a Wesleyan; and now he's occasionally
hsard of at St. Patrick’s K G. Church, Melbourne.
It was said by some of the papers that when
the lata Arthnr Skotohloy was amongst us his "Mrs.
Brown" was only a bad imitation of Diokons’s Mrs
Gamp. It now transpires, however, that Mrs. Brown
was known to Oxford und rgnduates forty years ago,
and consequently before Mrs. Gimp was born. How ho
hated Australia, to be sure I It was with a “ hate
known only on the st?gs " And Australia didn't like
him mush oUhT. Of the duosased author, Clement
Scott writes:—“In p ay writing, as in most other
things that ha attempted, he came too late into the
flild for any practical purpose*, aid cou’.d n-«t patiently

greater part of mooses. Tco late he went to America.
Australia, and elsewhere; too late bo wrote plays, and
novels, and books; toolati he begin entertaining the
public, too late he left oil ” He also testifies to "the
Bound common sense cf ’Mrs. B own,”* and gives it
as his opinion tbit Gerga Bose was always raisneder-
atood— beiug, in fact,a satirist when the world belioved
him to ba a droll.

ooiuoidtnoe that this same Earl, a short time before,

days of Castlereagh. The gentleman who was mur.

Poor Joaquin Miller seems very much to have
dwindled late a kind of Edgar Allan Poo plight. He
lives in a little flit at the top of a big lodging honse in
Now York, consisting of three small rooms and a
kitchen, in which he fries his own "porter house’*
steaks (at which he is a great adept), writes plays, and
gets drank. His hair is very long now. but his morals
appear to bo so short that he is tabooed by New York
society. In the full of his popularity he used to
" carry on" with millionaires’ matrons to a consider-
able extent, and each dav in the week took a different
banker’s bride for a walk in Central Park. This got
him disliked In Broad and Wall-streets—in fact "down
town” generally. He had a war of calliag in the day
time, and reciting poetry in Fifth Avenue mansions.
But be wasn’t particular. If the mistress wasn’t in,
he d recite to the maid ; and if the maid was engaged
with a constable, he’d have up the cook. People oon-
sidired this irregular, and now the erstwhile follower
of Wa)ker ? in Nicaragua, is banned So he passes his
time writing plays, cooking porter house steaks, and
getting drunk. And a very sensible way of passing the
time,tool Wo except, of course, the writing of the
plays.
William Degraves, who died the other day, was,
twenty years ago, one of the best known figures in
, Collins-street, Melbourne. He died, as already stated,
a pensioner on his good brother’s bounty, yet there
was a time when he was perhaps os wealthy as any
one in the colonies. He was a little satnrnine man with
tightly pinched lips, and a snappy, decided manner He
was the incarnation of business. His operation emu-
lated those of a Vanderbilt or Jay Gould. With an
over strained confidence in the immediate prospect* of
Australia, he plnrged boldly, staked all on the cards,
aul lost. He tangut the Union Bank a severe lesson
over the oasoof l»igraves v. M Mu hn. Dagravos. at
th« height of his wealth, had a skeleton fallowing him
about Melbourne in the shape of one Turnbull, who
had expressed a determination to take the life of the
millionaire for some petty business disappointment.
Degraves had at last to bring the man np before the
Police Court. F >r soma months ho experienced those
feelings which Rothschild expresned whoa some one
told him he ought to be the happiest man on earth,
and he then produced a latter from a parson who
threatei eI to shoot him if he did not send £L,0 In
his latter years Dagravas felt too keenly the happiness
of having no treasure laid up on earth, and no people
wanting to slay him.
The S.M. Herald has received a letter from
Max Strakosoh, the operatic speculator of America, and
says he is a brother-in-law of Patti Adelina. This re-
lationship is a puzzler. Adelina has but one sister—
Catletts,—who passed through these colonies not so
long ago, and was certainly not manied to Strakssch
at the time. Every true musician i i devoted to some
instrument, and to all appearances, Carlotta, while hero
was wedded to her Violinoello. Ho was a most accom-
plished performer. So Strakosoh couldn’t be Adelina s
brother-in-law by way of Carlotta. And Adelina has no
brothers ; and even if she had it seams improbable that
Max would have married one of these gentlemen, and
become Adelina’s brother-in-law that way. Than
taking the thing the other way, Adelina has only two
husbands at present. The Marquis de Caux, is too first
—soripturnlly speaking. By scripturally speaking, we
mean a reference to the passage which says “ the first
shall be and the last shall be first.” The Marquis
was the first, and is decidedly a bad second to Nioolini
at present- However, Strakosoh can’t very well be da
Caux's “ long lost brother,” because he Is a much older
man than de Caux, and wonld undoubtedly, on
being identified by the strawberry marks on his nose,
have assumed the title, and magnanimously left the
estates in the ex Marquis’ possession. The estates, we
have reason to believe, consist at present, chiefly of cne
shirt and three socks (in pawn), a black froek oeat,
deficient in buttons but convenient for pinning in front
close np under the chin, a hat which has been troubled
wi'h the mange, one bulbous boot, and a patent
leather shoe, oracket at one seim, a bad breath, and
thr»e cherished autograph letters, from the great song-
stress, vowing eternal defection, and refusing to send
another stiver. It is oiea*-, anyway, that Strakosoh
can’t be Adelina’s brother-in-law by way of Caux.
Thera only remains Nicolini. Strakosoh may to
Nioollnl's brother, and Adelina’s brother-in-law in that
way. But considering that M .x is a fair and Acrid Jew,
and Nioolini a dark and spare Neapolitan Christian
(more or less), if Adelina is tistor-in-law to Strakosoh
that way, it seems rather rough upon the fn ; r fame of
her mother-in-law, Mrs. Strakosoh alias Nioolini. We
give it up. Perhaps the Morning Missionary will show
its erudition iu ecclesiastical matters, and explain how
the relationrbip exists.
Years ago, ia N.S.W., a well-eduoated young
fellow managed somehow or other to ally bimself with
a bushranging gang. His exploits were mild and almost
nil, and his career was short, for he was immediately
captured by the polios and ” sent up ” for seven years,
which he served, less the remission period to which
an unexceptionable prison career entitled him. When
the weary years of gaol life had gone by, and he found
himself free once more, he, having been studious while
in durance, took to teaching as a means of livelihood,
and obtained employment in a State School. In apply-
ing for appointment he made no reference to bis ofi.mce
and its expiation He would go, he thought, to the
little bush township, and face the world once more.
No one would know him, ho would work on ; and if in
course of titno it should happen that someone filled in
the blank of seven years, the world would judge him,
not by the unhappy slip he made when ho was but a
foolish boy and his blood was hot, but by his industry
and fidelity as the master of a buffi school. He proved
a successful teacher, and obtained the goolwill and re-
spect of parents whcsi children were committed to his
charge. He fall in love with a girl and married her, after
committing to her the secret of his life Aid, one day,
there came to the bash townffiip, ju.it os to Kina’s Lyon
cun a Houseman, who lured Eugono Aram to bis doom,
a ruffian who had served a sentence in Darbnr-
hurst He saw the schoolmaster and recognised him.
Like Houseman, he wanted money—he would have
mouey; and, if the schoolmaster would not give him
money, he wonld expose him, and let the people know
what sort of man was training up their children. The
unfortunate teacher replied that he had just been
married, that he had but a miserable salary, and that
he had no large sum to give. Whereupon the gaol-bird
went to the public-house, got drunk, and loudly pro-
claimed at the bar and in the streets that the school-
master had bseo a fellow-prisoner of his in Darling-
hnr-t. Toe schoolmaster said nothing, but applied to
the Education Department for a transfer to a distant
school. Ha was transferred accordingly. And then
there came between the teacher and bis daily orust—
another ex-oonvict ? No, the police. The resident police-
man informed the police of the town to which the school-
master was transferred that be was identical with so
and so, the ex-bnsbranger. And the police, not con-
tent, as was their duty, with knowing that the man
had been in gaol, and telling the Education Department,
talked and blathored among the townspeople. The
Department of course called upon the rchoolmaster for
an explanation. He told his story. He had been wild
when young, but, he had had a bitter lesson, and had
profited by it. Th 1 * people did not want him dismissed,
the police were hounding him. Hie wife was near her
confinement. He asked his Minister for God’s sake to
spare him for her sake. But it was decided that he
should be dismissed This man (the grandson of an
English poet) is a victim of the intolerable theory that
it is necessary that a man who once commits a crime
mnst be hunted like a wild beast—that any offender
who offers evidences of reformation is only preparing
plans in secret for proying afresh on the community.
Perhaps, in view of what hss occurred in State schools,
the Government had no alternative but to remove him
from ihU particular sphere of employment. But
having oast- him adrift, and deprived him of employ-
ment, they have clearly Incurred a heavy responsi-
bility.
We have been reading some verse by Lady
Wilde, the mother of Oscar. Her ladyship, i» now
(we say it tenderly but firmly) an old woman, has not
yet laid down her “ Speranza ” lyre. At one time she
wrote good, stirring, simple lyrics; now she has fallen
into some of the evil wave of her son. Here are
specimens from her last wild dash at the skirts of the
Muse
** I was a woman of beauty, I was a woman of sin ;
Uod made me perfect in all things save the soul that
was set within,
And that was fashioned in darkness of the seven sins
of hell;
Tet was I fair to look on as the Angels before they
fell.”
This confession is, of course, dramatic and impersonal,
as far as Lady Wilde is concerned, but not a savoury
thing to proceed cither from tho lips or the pen of a
lady. Oscar can say such things with impunity, because
madness has its privileges, but we should be sorry to
have to think that the madness is with him hereditary.
Again
" Sunbeams of heaven wore tangled in the mesh of my
golden hair,
But the snakes that torture and kill were coiling and
nestling there.
In the k'ss of my rosebud lips lay a poison of subtle
surprise,
And I laughed ao I thought in my heart who touches
them loves—and dies.”
The description here is certainly pretty and even force-
ful, but tho chief charm of the passage is its audacity.
Wo, now, who can write pcetry “as easy as pie," dare
not describe onr appearance in this roseate way, lest
some fine day an enemy should publish our portrait and
“give us away." But Lady Wilde does not atop at
this* Her heroine (we have raid that wo believe the
poem to be objective) winds up with the gloomy admis-
sion that she has—
*' A soul made black with sin,
Dead lips and a heart of ashes, accursed without and
within.
No garland, no song, no praises, the chorus ef flat-
tereis mute,
No incense from kneeling lovers, silent the lay and
the lute.
Only from depths of my spirit a ory for tho wreck of-
tho past,
Remorse for a ruined life. And despair and at
the Jast!"
Now, isn’t this a nice sort of thing for the mother of a
grown-up family to write? If Lady Wilde would
occupy her spare time in visiting the sick and succour-
ing the starving, the world would think much mere of
her than it is over likely to do by reading her verse
The world onn do v.ry nioely without Lady Wilde’s
ancient simulations of patsion Only a true poet is
allowed to live without being held responsible for his
share of the ordinary work of the world—and ho isn’t
allowed to live that way till he’s dead

two styles in the serial, moie or less vocalized, but both

moments spent in deciphering the cramped hierogly-

production suddenly ceased to appear. And in some

Fancy Liddiard, whose arrival hither may be

the followmg epic :—

There’s none we like so well
As Qriolet—this is a fact —
But why, we cannot tell;
But there are things we can’t describe.
They must bo seen or heard,
And this. I tell you, is the case
With Fanny Liddiard
She’s broken many a young man’s heart.
And mine among t he many.
In Griolet, that merry part.
My heart was snared by Fanny.”
Finny, who was chaperoned through her tour by Mrs.
fctmythe, was, of course, properly disgusted by this
rugged poetry, aad sent back the flowers and the
following reply :—
Take back your flow'rs —they cost a bob;
Yonr verse disgusts me quite
If yon would make my soft heart throb.

Or, etay I don’t trouble more to sing—

After this, we grew just a trifle sceptical —
enough so, anyhow, to deride upon giving the muramFra
a show. Churchill wrote “ Aotors as actors are lawful
game," but though we know every professional in Sydr ey,
from the • Romany Bye’* dog downwards, we have never
met an actor or actress who could see it. The
fact is the neat old lady who need to do the Herald
notices and the Eum lubricators have spoiled aotors
and actresses for honest criticism. They like to antici-
pate it; to know that somebody, after making a soup-
tnroen of his mouth all the evening, has whispered to
his "dramatical cricket" "Say it .took well and gave
pleasure to allto be told by auother scribe after the
show that he " has got a splendid line ;’* to be assured
by a man who is—like water —"laid on" to do the
theatres, that he has got " half-a-ton of jam." This is
what makes actors happy. Then when they meet yon
they smile beamingly, and invite yen to partake of
refreshment. But once deliver yourself of a criticism,
which, while every effort is made to speak favourably,
baa embodied in it a tinge of honesty, look out for
squalls. Stars will scowl at yon melodramatically,
actresses will flaunt yon in the streets; and, likely as
not, some poor hangers on to the shirta of some gifted
but unappreciated creature will waylay yon by nignt at
the corner of some dark street, ard, confident in their
numbers, attack you On the whole, therefore, dramatic
criticism is, at it will'bo seen, a pleasant and alluring
profession I Sailors have a jocular (but, we are grieved
to add, somewhat irreverent) wav of saying—“If yon
go te sea for pleasure, you’ll go to hell for pastime."
This at once suggests to us another proverb
“ A critic's trust: he who with joy would fill it,
Would jump with pleasure at the hangman’s billet.”
But, now for the play.

We have hoard, as the sphere has (according to
the gospel of Joshua) revolved, a great deal about the
Dunning crowd. We have read of wars and rumours of
wars; of deprecating things Wallace has said to Ban-
ning, and of fierce things Dunning has said to Wallace.
Such a fire-eater did wo imagine A.T. to. be that we
figured to ourselves, when thinking of him, a fierce,
black-whiskered, wsx-moustachiod impresario, whose
teeth had the Cagli grind, and every flash of whaae
eyes omitted sparks of passion. Well, we have seen
Mr. Dunning, and we have been pleasantly disillusioned
As we were going into the Opera House on Monday
night, some one said to us—"Allow mo to introduce
you to Mr. Dunning." We looked about for some
moments, and at length discovered a very diminu-
tive little gentleman, with three Lilipntian diamond
studs, and the smallest legs we have seen since
we took a touching farewell of Japanese Tommy. Soraa
one suggested refreshment, and we (of course) acceded;
but wo missed Mr. Dunning three times on our journey
to the bar-room. When we had imbibed, tho treasurer
told ns that, after being lost three times on the Adelaide
steamer, the captain considered it his duty, as the
guardian of his passengers, to hang the improssario on
his watch-chain We have an idea that this gentleman
embellished a bit; bat all we know is that, at the con-
clusion of the performance, we wore nn&ble to discover
Mr Dunning anywhere, notwithstanding that we care-
fully searched all our ulster pockets.

He is the mildest manner’d man
That ever sacked a baritone:
Look in bis face, and then you can
See bonhomie is there alone.

That Gentleness alone reigns there.

Bat, in spite of the smallness of his stature,
Mr. Dunning has within him a profound knowledge of
one of the weakest spots in the human heart. His
theory is that the people like logs. Well, they do like
legs And, therefore, tho Students and Duoal pages are
very popular. All these ladies are conscientious. They
show as mnohof themselves as possible. If they showed
any more of their figures than they do, we should not
feel justified, on conscientious grounds, in visiting the
show, without an especial permit, in writing, from Mr.
Jeiferis. For—
Since discovered ’neath tho laurel, we were brought up
very moral,
And we’ve talked of Joseph at our mother s knee:
So we’re most apt to coasiddy, that the show is very
giddy, .
When op'ras anatomical we see.
Of the scene, though, we are noters, and if we don’t spot
the “gloaters,”
We will give you, gentle readers, leave to smile ;
How thev look so soft, jet hard, sirs, as they leer at
Smith and Chard, sirs.
Both those damsels supercilious the while.
Then the limelight does oft glint, sirs, upon tights of
ev’ry tint, sirs.
Upon legs of ev’ry form, and upon thighs of ev ry
shape;
And the swells say "Haw, dam jolly,” though with
mug most melancholy
The stricken barber does forlornly gape.
O, those many-coloured fleshings are a great big bunch
of blessings,
(Why to-day we cannot rhyme a little bit);
And the Land clerks save their lunches and "put do wn”
the cheese at Punch’s
Just to save a bob to squeeze into tho pit.
At the old pitch you may hammer; talk of Shakespeare
and the "dratnmer"
Bub we know ’tis little Dunning that is wise ;
Give “ Marino Paliero," theatre bosses, if you dare, O,
And the pit would scream out for a Bridge of—
Thighs.

The beat possible thing we can say for the
management of the Opera House is that " Boccaccio” is
an opera whose tendencies arc indirectly giddy. Of tho
plot it boots na not to speak—principally because we do
not shoos. To descend to stony seriousness, there is no
plot We might allude to Boocaooio’s if.mortal work
in illustration of the opera, did we elect to; but we
are crushed at the outlet We saidto Alfred last week
" Have you read tho ‘Decameron’ " No,” he replied,
"I didn’t know thp Chairman of Committees spoke last
ni*ht" But, plot or no plot, " Boccaccio’’, is
undeniably amusing, and the symmetry of the legs is also
undeniable. There is, it strikes us, little more wanted
than this in opera-boutte now-a-days. Mr. Dunning’s
company is, all told, a good one ; and wo have no donbt
whatever that it will draw a very great many people for
a considerable time. To speak in detail. Miss Kate
Chard, the (presumable) star, is a symmetrical lady of
fascinating features, who enacts the part of Boccaccio,
and will, doubtless, sing admirably when she has sent a
boy to fetch that voice which she has got a habit of
leaving under her pillow. But, voice or no voice. Miss
Chard finds, ibis but fair to state, great favour with the
audience; so we suppose she is happy. We hope eo,
anyhow. The lady who is supposed to rank next to
Mias Cbard is Mies Ivanova—who cruelly confuees
mankind by pronouncing it Ivan.ova This lady plays
Piammetta, and is endowed with a No. 3 voice cf most
excellent timbre and calibre. She is, therefore, charm-
ing. But we don't mind saying that when she fetched
for a high Q, we hold on to the seat of eut fauteuil. Miss
Josephine Deakin made a delightful picture. She was
the wife of Lotteringhi, the cooper, who is made love to
by the Prince, and she was altogether quite esteeeivQ.
•• Fativre \“
The low comedians of the company are Messrs. 1
Gaorge Dean, T. B. Appleby, and Harry Power. Of tho
trio, the last is probably the best, but. the “show " he
had was limited. Still he shone. Even though he
r.idn’t assert himself, he wos a Power in tho company.
You can now kill ns ; tut not before we tell yon that
George Dean, as the drunken cooper, was droll, yet not
too droll; but wo consider it a pity he should model
his vocalization upon the whirr-rr of a sawmill. Mr
Appleby’s Lambertuooio was a well.flaisbad per-
formance; but undoubtedly the cleverest impersona-
tion in the whole opera was that of 'ons Loredau as
the Prince This gentleman is quite clever: his by-
play alone tlfordirg a wholesome lesson to artists who
consider that their miseicn is to storm the pit by pitch
alone.

The choruses wore excellent. Some of the girls,’
by tbe way, are given a line here end there Ore pas-
sage in tho opera occurs as follows1st Page—“ Here
aro tbe citizens coming.” 2nd Page—“Oh, yes. Don’t
they look vcndicative.” This is very great, and oanstd
ue (we are easily amused) much merriment. But these
trifles are, of course, mere detail.

“ Boccaccio,” as a whole, is bright and pretty
and “ tuney.” The scenery is attractive and pictur-
esque, albeit the painter has got a Habtdt of being
rather conventional. The ensemble, however, is very
great. And we, in company with the bald-heads, the
gloaters, and the young parties with the heyeglaeses,
hope that “ Boccaccio" will have a very long run. We
repeat that, in common (this is only whisper) with these
worthies we hope and pray for it. We may remark, cn
parenthese, that we very often hope, but we very seldom
pray.

Frank Towers is fetching them over in Mel-
bonrne. Frank is a facetious rogue. The papers over
there speak of “ 1 Maggie’s Dream,’ a piece understood
to have been written by Mr. Frank Towers 1“ We are
glad of one thing. We are glad he never gave na to
understand this. There are times when even the
strongest-willed people cannot control their fury. We
shudder to think of what we might have done in such a
case- Rosa is so popular over there as to be almost
beloved. Happy Rosa 1

The actor’s ideal of an innkeeper lives up in a
Northern town. This ideal is feminine. Every morn-
ing sho serves tho members of any company which may
be staying at her house with nun and milk, free. The
other day a small company put up there The first
morning they didn’t know her Utile eccentricity, and
consequently only had half-a-dozen friends between
them. But on the following morning they made up for
this unprofessional, though unconscious, neglect of
opportunity. Tho gonial landlady served out forty-
eight drinks before sho remonstrated. At the forty-
ninth, she observed, with mild surprise, that somehow
the company seemed to have incroaeed during the
night. “ Bless your good soul, no,” said one, “ we are
only- drinking in character,” And each man had to
play a lot of parts jast then.

Some kind and engaging friend hath sent us a
droll account of tho amateurs* “Patience” at New-
castle, which we have read with much gusto. We have
taken an interest in tbe amateurs of what Alfred calls
“ the ooally city," ever since Ashcroft Edwards
produced “Pinafore" there; »nd though this swain
hath left, and is now at Darling Point, we still
have an r flection for the amateur entertainments
whioh take place in that centre, tbe inhabi-
tants of which are periodically paralyted by the
luminous lucubrations (that, is tbe Melioan style) of the
captivating Cave. The conductor was, it appears, a Mr.
W. A. Key. As to the moving-spirit, we at once satisfy
yonr Key-uriositee I But let our gifted correspondent
speak for himself. He says (in a brilliant way he has
apparently made his own). “‘Patience’ has been one
of the most successful amateur performances that has
(sip) been placed upon the boards of the Vio. t I think it
far succeeds (sic) the previous performances” (sic).
Wo are glad to hear this, though wo don’t quite know
what it means. We are also enchanted to ienrn that
“the orchestral department acquitted thewselvcs well,
and without any mistakes whatever” (sic). And our
correspondent concludes with the followinv : “ Proifes-
sionals (sic) have expressed surprised (sic) at tho per-
formance of these amateurs." Of this we have no
doubt whatever. By tho way, what a fitting man Key
would be to conduct Looka’s music. Eh ?

Lewis's Mastodon Minstrels are now in Now
Zealand. They are said to be doing pretty well, whioh
is pretty well for them ; but we can hardly reconoile
this news with what the local papers say about tho

This is cur joke. If they are doing well, how is it that
tho Wolfe is at the door P

Recently Mr. Augustus Harris, leasee of the
T.R , Drury Lace, entertained at a matinee. A number
of frier ds were also invited ; but when the advertise-
ments’ stated, in- the morning, that the Foundling
Schools would occupy the pit. the peerage declined
coming to a man. Daring the afternoon tho kids were
regaled with fruit and cakes ; ard half-way through the
entertainment Mr. Harris delivered an address, in
whioh was embodied the brilliant couplet:—
“ I hope, having relished your orange and bun,
You’re ready again fer some frolic and fun.”
And a man was specially employed to write this. Hang
it 1 we begin to think now that a writer of theatrical
addresses is more wanted in London than even a droll
or a satirist.

In “ Nicholas Nickleby ” you will read that Mr.
and Mrs. queers regarded the hoys under their control
as their “ natural enemies." Well, strange to ray.it
would Appear that a number of tho theatro.servants cf
Sydney regard their patrons in precisely the same
light. To them, therefore, we reepeotmlly dedicate
the following lytic
You enter with as ulster and a wrapper round your
throat.
And of all the scowling ushers there’s not one will taka
your coat.
You hand it up yourself, and then “A programme,
please," you say.
But the usher can’t he bothered; ho is looking at the
play I
You find a programme somewhere, and then in quite a
heat,
You ask another lackey if he’ll show you to your seat.
And then he’ll look around lazily, that scene-admiring
man.
And say, “ Ob, just look over there ; you'll find it on the
plan."
And don’t the ladies revel in “attendants,” too,
“ polite!”
To see how timidly they ask for water is a Bight.
To go for porter—“ nevah 1" —that request’s too much
by far —
“ I couldn’t do a thing like that—it would olfend my
Ma I"

Emma Wangenhoim, with the remains of South’s
Opera Company, is in the Oulgong district, starring in
“ Boccaccio,” and Mr. Crc-agh, business-manager, tells

“takes well,” axd William mentions, casually, some-
thing about her having
“ Byes that entreat, implore, and sigh.

And talking of South’s Opera Company brings
ns, of course, to South. Well, he is basy, in Sjdney,
forming a comedy company, and is trying to get “The
Guv nor," in which he should be great ns the Deaf
Boatman. Mrs. South is all right again, now, and
Jimmy at last smiles aloud. Only good people will be
engaged, and a tonr of the whole colonies made. And,
while on the subject of big things, why not repeat
Rainer’s asseveration that his Diorama has cleared
£30C0 in two years P Ho does not, however, explain if
this phenomenal success is dno to the papier-mache
trays or to Phil Stuart’s moustache. It is certainly
not due to the diorama.

Millia haa gone to show in Adelaide, accom-
panied by the inevitable Moulton, where he will give
bis two entertainments “ The Wedding Breakfast,'*
and "Mr Popingjay’s Picnic," and Moulten will cure
cancer and consumption free of charge. This brings
ns, in one jnmp, to the fact that Ned Holloway has
been giving them "London Assurance" (with Mrs.
Ned as Lady Gay I), *‘ Blow for Blow,” and other trifles
at Bathurst. But, from what we can gather, Mr. H.
didn’t make more than a million out of it. This teems
to be owing to the fact that the swells stayed away,
and the erapule didn't come. Ned, however, is once
more on the road —let’s hope to Heaven.

“ The Bomany Bye ” is, of course, still run-
ning. And this reminds us (we don’t know why) of a
tale that is going the rounds, and which was told na
by (say) Pastor Allen, It seems that it is a rule in car.
tain theatres for the actors, as they pass in or out, to
salute the management. Well, at a theatre in this
city, the leading people don’t do this, but slur over
matters with “ Hnllo, old boy, how’do ?" and that sort
ofthirg. So, the other day, the manager called bis
star, and said: " We must bring these [angelsj up with
a round turn. There’s too much jam freedery in
this company."

The Sheridan season at the Gaiety is a success.
We are glad of this. W© are always amiable with
ability and beauty, which implies that we are alwoyson
good terms with (Sheridan and Payliss. Speaking of
Bayliss reminds us tf the fact that lie has made a corn-
plete alteration in the tout ensemble of the theatre ’J he
door be adorns himself j the inside, besides tho attrac-
tion of our too-much-loved Louise and that versatile
giant Sheridan, has tho novel attraction of presenting
rows of clean faces in the pit, and real gold and genuine
jewelled busts in the chairs And in the chairs, by tho
way, ladies use the conventional fans more than they
usee! to do. During the previous management, pro-
grammes were the fashionable media of fanning beauty.
Also, the people are, generally yet briefly speaking, of
a higher caste than those who formerly patronised this
haunt of the drama. The old ladies of the present
regime wear mot-caps j those of the former mostly
favoured mop-heads. And when we are talking about
revolutir nizing, it may be as well to say that Mr Bay.
liss has forbidden the orange and gingerbeor woman to
vend her wares in the theatre. His reason for this is
that he wants to keep the place select. You see this
old lady had a thoughtless habit of going up
to her fi lends in tho O'rcle, slapping them on
the shoulder, and enquiring in a tone of affec-
tionate thunder as to whether “ tho baby had
got over that rash hp had ’’ But there are persons
who say the real cause of her expulsion is some-
thing else altogether. Wo don’t know the real rights
of this case, but we do know that “ Arrah-na-Pogue" is
pulled through simply by Bheridsn and Louise. The
others are not bad ; we wish they woie. There is some
definite quality about badness, but none about hybrid
mediocrity. Yet, for all that, the ploy is well played.
We don’t know why Mr. Sheridan should wear a green
coat, or why the Irtsh boys in tho background should
wear whiskers like sausages right under their eyes, or
why anybody should look like a disinterred
toad. But we don’t know much, anyhow. The
end of it is that the whole thing is good in total,
and here and there in detail excruciatingly bad. If
these qualities do not,attract an audience, wo don’t
know what will —unless perhaps afrceluncb. But they
do attract audiences, which is good for Bayliss.
Mr. James Tyson.
Everybody is interested in a millionaire. Mr.
James Tyson, whoso portrait we give to-day, has
the reputation of being the wealthiest man in
Australia. Frugal in his habits, retiring in hia
manner, Mr. Tyson handles the largest enterprises
in a quiet way, and pursues his prosperous course
(to use an expression of his own) “ without making
a ripple on the surface.” He doesn’t smoke, he
uses no intoxicants, and prefers the plainest faro
to pate de foie gras and devilled snipe. Though
over 60, he is still a bachelor. But, who knows ?
Next year is leap-year, and some “ intelligent,
homely, English girl ’’—for such is the bride of
whom James is in quest—may yet land him and his
four millions.
The loea by wrecks in N.S.W. during the last
year amounted to £102.8 id. Had the Austral not been
raised, the lose would have been about £350,000. The
lives lost during the year were 36, the greater number
being by the wreck of the Woniora, collier, which went
down oil Botany with 15 souls.

The other day Redman, a Philadelphia saloon-
keeper, purchased a “woolly horse*' from one J. G.
Rise, who alleged that he had captured it with a lasso
in the wilds of Dakota. The curiosity was fourteen
and a halt hands high, and was known by the aborigines
as the “ sheep-borse." Wool three inches deep covered
the boast from pastern-joint to ears, and its roars strut k
terror to the stoutest hearts. Mr. Rice offered to sell
the animal to Mr. Redman for £150. Rodman hesitated.
■The uncertainty of the show business deterred him
from making the purchase, but when Mr. Rice informed
him that with careful training the “sheep-horse'' would
produce four crops of wool every season he consented
to buy. Redman was told that the wool of the “sheep-
horse” told readily for 6 dols. a pound, and was used in
the manufacture of camel-hair shawls. He paid 15 dols.
down, and agreed to tay the remaining £85 dols. at tho
cud ot sixty day if tho auima.1 turned out as represented.
Before the expiration of that time the sheep-horse began
shedding its o> at The wool dropped off in pounds until
none remained except four weoden stockings, which ex-
tended from hie hoofs to his knees. George Mason
testified that before the Dakota sheep shed its wool he
struck it on the ribs with a bat, but the wool was so
thick that the beast did not feel the blow. Redman
gave Rice fifteen dollars for a white-flannel lap-robo,
which the latter declared was from the fleece of the
woolly brute James Moffat said that afier the glue which
held tho wool dried out the fleece dropped or was
rubbed c II in the night. Redman said tho beast could
not perform half tho tricks Rice guaranteed it to perform,
and as the animal without its wool looted line a very
ordinary horsd he refused to settle with Rice. Elias
Scheick, a groom, testified that ho “wasn’t fond of tho
horse, because on one occasion it picked me out for the
blackest man at the performance.'' The jury rendered a
verdict in favour of Sice, who receives 566 dole, and,

“ Lilian Curtis, a prepossessing little child, was

A TOUCHING TALE.
[We do not, as a rule, insert pathetic poetry, but
wa feel bound to make an exception in this instance,
owing to the extreme beauty of the composition we now
offer to our readers—a poem in which everything that
is beautiful, chaste, elevating, and sublime, is truly and
artistically blended.—En. B.]
Ozjo night to ease an o’er-taxod brain,
We in a sea-girt suburb strolled.
And as we wandered strove in vain
A rhythmic fable to unfold.
Cool was the air; the holy stars,
Each with its mystery, gleamed on high j
And everywhere the tap'ring spars
Of ships stood out against the sky.
Oar way lay through a little street,
Which to seclusion did belong ;
When, lo, a voice both soft and swaat
We, crooning heard, a pretty song.
It was a eong of angels bright
Who ’light on earth mankind to save j
And melted was our soft heart quite
By each note of that simple stave.
A cottage door was opened wide.
And though the night was calm and mild,
Before a huge fire wo espied.
Stretched on a rug, b little child.
Beside the hearth a cauldron lay,
The flames roared up that chimney wide,
As in a deprecating way
We tapped the door and walked inside.
Sae stopped her song and raised her head,
But showed nor teiror, nor distress.
We kissed her gently, and we said—
•• Don’t say, child, thou art motherless !
Say not, dear one, thou hast not felt
The sweet joy of a mother’s kiss I”
Then slowly on her rug she knelt,
And what she softly said was this
•• My mother got—oh, it is sad I—
Five years, sir, for a pocket-book,
And I've bean living here with dad
Just ever since poor • mum' was took.
Dad kicked me here and broke my rib;
He’s cross when he the drink has got;
He’s gone out now to * crack a crib,’—
And there is father's melting-pot."

Miss Camille Dubois, having been divorced from
her husband by reaS&i of her giddy oonduot with’a
lieutenant who had served in the Zulu war, and who
supplemented his gallantry, on returning, by betraying
his friend, has gose on the stage again. She is engaged
to play in Diou Bauoioault’s new play, " The Amadan.”

engaged to parade hot guilt for the benefit of the

Madellw. Duools is without a rival on the London
stage. This miserable divorce business is ouiy addi-
tional evidence what a mistake it is for youlfg men of
good family to marry aotresses. As a matter of faof,
actresses are all imbued with a love of admiration to
such an extent that in a few years it becomes ft disease.

bay. So when married, they want admiration still; and
if they leave the stage, they replace that which is open
by concealment, for they must be admired. No man
out of the profession ever need think of marrying an
actress out hero. An actress should in 999 oases out of
1000, be the husband of an actor. Death is easy to pro-
cure. You can (with some trouble), purchase the

Mr. William Sabine, an old resident and twice
Mayor of Hay, died last week in hospital. Years ago,
when he kept a hotel, there was a demonstration or
something, which took the cx-Premier there, and
among the items was a ball at Sabine’s. Visions of a
polka with the Premier, or, at least, a ministerial
mazurka, tilled the mind of Mrs. William! but the
great man, after staying a half-hour amid the motley
throng of bullookiea, supers, and local tradesmen,
cleared without even asking her —the Mayor’s wife I—
for a plain quadrille. Disappointment succeeded her
joyous hopes. But to suppose any other than on 0
reason fer the Premier's omission never entered the
lady’s head, and, taming to “Billy,” in a tone of
intense disgust, she saidi “My gracious I Sabine,
Parkas can’t dance.” ,

Mr. Amy Horton, whose other name is Bnohan-

arrived as Amy was doing the skipping-iope dance in
the pantomine at Wellington, When she skipped elf
she hoard the news, and immediately called for porter.
Next morning Sir Buchan.Hepburn was waited on at
his hotel, and offered credit for a horse, a bull-terrier,
patent leather shoes, and a Dutch oven. In the after,
noon they went for a stroll, and there was much doffing
of oadies at pro.-hauiited corners ; and during the even-
ing the baronet received no less than 15 letters, all of
which began “Dsar old boy,” and ended “will bo
punctually repaid in a fortnight.” Sir B H. and lady
leave shortly for Europe, where it is expected they will
make a splash of no inconsiderable magnitude.

Charles R. Thorne, jun., the heat light
comedian America over had, is dead. His complaint Is
called in the New York papers “consumption of tho
stomach.” Anyhow, ho died. When in the flesh he
was very tall, and renowned for his meanness, notwith-
standing the fact that he earned over £100 a week. A
story is told of him that onoe a poor actor called on him
to borrow a few dollars. “ I oan’t give you money,”
replied Thorne, “ but I can give you food.” Tho poor
actor smacked his lips in anticipation of a rekorky
repast. In half an hour tho girl came In with some
pork and beans. “ Why, I cm gat that at home. My
uncle gave mo a barrel of pork last Tuesday.” “ Did
he P” said Thorne, his eyes sparkling ; “ I say—if—if
I send the girl round with you, would you give her a
few nice pieoes in a pie dish ?" Then tho poor actor ate
a cracker, drank a glavs of water, and sadly departed.
By the way, Thorne's funeral was in tho moat hideous
taste. It was an ostentatiously “infidel” affair. A tenth-
rate “infldol” pronounced a panegyric, and a telegram
from Bob. Ingorsoll was gummed on to the hearse.

But, there; you’re all dying to hear it, so here goes. A
lady went to take some Pcapea at Shaw’s nice drapery,
when she saw hanging up a most elaborate costume—
all ready to be sent home. Much struck with tho
beauty of tho toilette, she inquired the price of a
similar one, and on this being quoted to her she sighed
sorrowfully. Suddenly, inspired by curiosity, she said
" Perhaps 'you wouldn’t mind telling me the name cf
the lady for whom this beautiful dress has been made P’
“ Not at all, madam,” replied a polite assistant, all
smiles and shirt-collar. In a minute or so ho came
back beaming. “ It’s not for a ladiy at all: it’s for a
gentleman,” said he, cracking his little joke. “A
gentleman—.” " Yes : Mr.M’Croodle.” “ Why, good

my birthday. Pack it up directly, and pat it in tho
carriage.” Pour hours later : “ Oh, yon dear love of a
ducky—you darling, kind hubby (kiss) to buy me (kiss,

gentleman may have been seen d g tho parrot and

Perhaps the greatest squattah on earth is De

Boman, resolved to catch rome fish for Good Friday,

said; “ All fish caught in my creek are my property.
How dare you cook fish in my kitchen, when there is

boss, who, during tho oration, was picking his tooth

The Supreme Court, Launceston, under the presidency
ot Mr. Justice Dobson, was occupied two days last
week trying an action for broach of promise ot marriage
and seduction, instituted by Miss Emma Fletcher,
daughter of a respectable resident of Campbell Town,
against Thomas Head lam, a son of one of the well-
known family of wool-kings of the Macquarie Eiver,
The Premier of the colony (Hon. W. B. Qiblin) appeared
for the and Mr. Byron Miller for the defend-
ant. Mr. Gilflin, in opening the case, remarked that
his client’s cup c£ bitterness was filled to overflowing
by the death within the previous few hours of the issue
of their intimacy. The depositions of the plaintiff’s
father, who is deceased since the cause of action arose,
were read. The plaintiff deposed to the circumstances
attending the bringing about of the intimacy between
hor and the defendant} a number of letters were read,
of which the foilswing are characteristic specimens : —
“ May 12,1881. My Dear Emmie,—Your note came
to hand all safe yesterday. Concerning Fingal dance, I
think it is rather a long way to go, but if you want to go
I don’t mind driving you; that is, provided they would
allow such a proceeding, which I hope they won’t, as I
don’t want to go. You see Campbell Town dance is
fixed for the 23rd, and, if we go to Fingal on the 20th, it
w ill hardly give us time to get to Campbell Town dance.
I am glad you have made up your mind not to go to
Vauoluso jot a while. When do jou intend going to
the Island for six months, naughty girl? I am afraid

‘‘Glenelg Cottage, July 26.—My dearest Tom,—
Yours to hand this morning. I thought I had better
write, and prepare you for som o very unpleasant news.
There was ratnor a seene here last evening. Naylor
came; had a long talk with my mother. She went on
her knees to me, and asked mo to tell her if anything
bad passed between yon and I. For a long time I
would not tell—at last sBe went to tell Dr. Naylor. . .
I knew then it would come out, so I thought
I had bettor tel! a little She then said she
would ask you to marry me at once, in case there was.
No one need know, aud I oould come homo again. Do
you blame me for telling, Tom, darling? What, was I
to do I’m so sorry for yen. I would have
done anything to have saved you from this unpleasant-
ness, but I could not help it, could I ? Don’t be too
hard on me. I don’t think there is anything the mat-
ter. How would there be, for I solemnly swear no one
else I think the best thing we can do is
to be quietly married, that is if yon wish to marry
me; but, Tom, if yon have any suspicion ....
don't think of marrying me, fer I’d rather
never see you again than marry you, and if you
do marry mo I II try my best to be a good wife to you.
I went to Leven yesterday and got some medioine.
Will you come in as soon us possible, for I must see
you it I’m not out. Come up as soon as you come in,
for I would like to have a talk to you beforemy mother
sees you. My peor father is very ill to-day I'm sure
ho won’t last many weeks longer. I shall bo g’ad when
it is over; it will be a happy release for him. Hoping
to see you on Saturday.—Ever yours, Em."
‘‘Monday, August 14. Dearest Tom,—I am writing
to ask if yon will come and see me once before I leave
Tasmania for ever. Oh I Tom, don’t refuse mo. Wa
might never see each other again. I hope you will
think kindly of me, and I can only tell you once again
I have never wronged you ; and, as God Is my witness,
you are the father of my ohiId,»but I freely forgive you
for the great wrong yon have done, and will always
remain the same to you, Aftorwhat has happened, if
is Imporsiblo I can stay here. Henceforth I am an out-
cast, without a home or a penny. Aek your conscience
if you act rightly towards me. It it is clear, I am
content. If you can come in as soon as you receive
this, I will try and see you. The only place I can think
of is the old show-ground. If you come round between
the two grounds you will find a place in the fence. Get
through, and I'll join you. Come at half-past 2. Don’t
bo later, if wet, come Wednesday. I would name some
other place, but I can’t walk far. I have not been np
since I hoard the news. You will keep this secret, as
I’ve been forbidden to write. In great haste,—E.
P 8.—Do come. It's so long since I’ve seen you.
Don’t let anyone know yon are coming.”
Mr. Giblin contended for his client that her ease of
breach of promise was proved, because no atterrpt had
been made to contradict her. There was evidence that
Headlam attributed to his father the breach of his
promise He had led the girl to believe that he would
receive £20,000 on the division of his father's estate.
Before the girl had implored him to come back, he had
placed himself in his father’s hands. The father seemed
to havo acted as his son’s evil genius. Defendant
attributed to his father his being unable to show the
letters which he said would prova his innocence. His
non-appearance at Campbell Town was also oa account
of his father’s preventien. All these things went to
show that Headlam, tho defendant, bad balanced his
duty to tho girl ho had so deeply wronged with the
prospect of getting the £20,0C0 from his father, and
had oloeted to please bis father rather than act as an
honourable man. A verdict of five sevenths of the
jury was recorded for the plaintiff, damages £4GC0. It
has been stated that the jury pronounced Headlam to be
the seducer of Miss Fletcher and the father ot the
child, and that they think they made a serious omissiiifn
in not attaching a found rider to that effect. The re-
suit waa received with acclamation by an excited
crowd.
WHY HE WAS WAITING.
’T was a golden summer’s morn.
The sky was soft and blue.
The sun gleamed on the foliage.
And on the wavelets, too;
And, lo, outside an hostelrie
The weary time there whiled
A boy with curls all clustering—
A Jaeav'nly-looking child.
And in the dewy-scented morn,
So balmy and so fair.
Behold a white-hair’d clergyman,
On chapel bent, passed there.
Full old he was, with flawing beard,
And when he saw the child.
He gazed on him with limpid eye.
And said in accents mild
•• What I waiting for thy father, boy ?
Who’s in this place of sin?
Oh. shun this hideous temple, for

The French Minister of War stopped the
cavalry manoeuvres in Paris, as he distrusted the alle-
giance of G6rdral de Gallifet, commandant of that
branch of the forces. This news does not surprise us a
bit. The Marjais do Gallifet was one of the Emperor
Napoleon’s favourites, and married one of the Em-
press’? maids of honour—a lady more remarkable for
her beauty than for the manner iu which she minded
her p’s and q’s. When war was declared with Germany,
the Ma'qnis joined the aimy as a cavalry general, but
nothing much was beard of him until the Commune
was established in P ris, and de Gallifet was given
orders to oust Domcrowski He undertook for M.
Thiers this task, and after a lotof severe fighting, made
his entry into Paris from Versailles through the Arc
do Trioraphe iu the Champ d’Elyfde, and then he com-
menced to irfliot a terrible Issson on the * Communards ’
Outwardly a gandinot the most exquite kind, he betrayed
such cruel and bloodthirsty instincts in restoring order
that all Paris was horrified, and even his own party
was disgusted. In the Belleville quarter, that of St.
Auteine, the heights of Moatmartre, and in all the Com-
munist-centres, the mass lore by his order was fearful
Every soul that appeared a window was shot dead ; and
in clearing the streets, acting under the excited notion
that every woman was a pitroleuse, hundreds of innocent
girls were ruthlessly speared and bayonetted. Imme-

fashion, completely eclipsing, in all her ideas, the efforts
in that direction of Mdilo. Dosne, M. Thiers' adopted
daughter. At heart Gallifet is a Bonapartist; and,
therefore, the Hebald wire in this instance has a
curious and actual semblance, not only of the possible,
but of the probable. Ceoi est un peu curieux I A later

Sara Bernhardt’s husband, M. Damala, who is
a Greek by nationality, despairing of success in his
role of actor has resolved to return to his original
profession of soldier. As might be expected, this
break-up of the Damala manage has given rise to much
gossip. There are some ill-ns’ured enough to suggest
that it is not so much the rSle of actor as of hnsuand
for which Monsieur feels himself unfit, and they
comment saroasti rally on that feature of his renewed
taste for soldiering which requires him to be located
in Algeria. The divine tiara is said to take a very
philosophical view of the case. “ M. Damala’s talent

viewers ; “ but ha has had illusions on the subject.

thirty-eight years of ago, medium in stature, with

original, and romantic books ever known in the
literature of travel. Evea in London, entering his

The lato A gent-General of Queensland, the
Hon, Arthur Maealister, was a notable man in his day.
He was a solicitor practising at Ipswich, on the
Brisbane River, when Queensland was made a separata
colony, and being elected to the Assembly, rapidly
made his way to the front. Mr. R. Q. W. Herbert, Sir
George Bowen’s imported Premier, able man as he was,
rapidly recognized the necessity of separating Mao-
alister from the embryo Opposition. Maealister never
permitted convictions to interfere with the satisfaction
of hia love of power. He promptly crossed the House,
and became Mr. Herbert’s Minister for Lands and
Works, Under his auspices the railways of Queensland
were inaugurated, and its borrowings commenced. The
colony awoke from the stagnation of an obscure pro-
vinoe to the full vigour of individual existence. Money
and population flowed in. Everyone was bnsy, values
were everywhere rising. Amidst this bustling scene
Arthur Maealister was the most prominent figure. Ho
still resided at Ipswich, which was then, and until nearly
a score of years later, connected with Brisbane only by
road and river. The distance is twenty-five miles, the
road was fairly good, and at that time the most
important thoroughfare in the colony. Maoalister’i
buggy whisking past, behind a great trotter, used to be
a familiar spectacle at that time, and an invitation to
one of the balls at his house in the river bend at North
Ipswich was no much a social stamp as the en Me to
Government House. He made a prodigious blunder in ore
sense by the terms on which he had the railways con-
structed. Filziibbon, the Chief Engineer, was contract! r
to the Government as well, and supervisor of his ewa
work. He made in a few years an immense fortune, and
perhaps not caring to sustain the torrent cf rumours
as to the fashion in which it was made, quitted Queen'*
land a wealthy man, never to return. There were net
wanting men at the time to hint that if Arthur Mao-
alister had received all hd had stipulated for, he would
have been better oft' and Fitzglbbon not to well. ; one
of the outlays were almost fantastically extravagant.
The Bremer River was spanned by a bridge costing
£09,000, which a few years later was thrown out of use,
as it led merely to a preposterous detour. The bridge
still stands, a monument of corruption, but the loop of
railway it l«d to is grass-grown and nearly obliterated,
the line now tunning by a shorter course without cross-
ing the river at all. This was but one of scores of ex*
pensive iron bridges imported to be erected under the
very shadow of magnificent forests of iron-bark and
gum trees Maealister, however, although be had not
enriched himself, had scattered so many good things
around among his familiars and jackals, that ha
was always secure of a strong and influential following.
And, being a ready speaker, and gifted with the dex-
terity requisite to enable him to read the temper of the
majority, bis principles never stood in hia light, and be
was for years a mast popular Minister. Like most men
of hia kidney, he habitually stole and produced as bis
own any striking conception communicated to him, and
by a device of this sort, fully exposed at the time, be
wjs the first to foreshadow the project of a transconti-
nental railway to the Gulf of Carpeptaria. But Maoallshf
was too habitually treacherous, and had tog often saori?
flood trusty friends to his own exigencies, to stand upon
very firm ground. Neglect of hia professional businesa
made him needy, and, as a borrower, he fell under
private obligations which he could only repay as a
politician. The choice of colleagues was more than
once governed by the necessity for including a creditor
or the representative of a creditor; and it even became
necessary for him to bow his neok and accept a subor-
dinate post under Mr. Charles Jjillej’s Premier-
ship, rather than be left out in the cold.
He avenged himself by a deliberate betrayal; and
while a member of Mr. Lilley’s Cabinet, was
simultaneously in treaty for the Premiership in the
Government with which the Opposition were preparing
to replace Mr. Lilley’s. To follow his political adven-
tures would bo vain. They were as various and a»
vicious as the intrigues of a prostitute. So long a*
Mr. Maealister preserved his mental vigour, he managed
to hold bis ground with the unscrupulously intelligent
and the indiscriminatingly ignorant in the colony.
when his capacity commenced to slacken, his mistakes
multiplied. The strain of constantly disguising insin-
cerity, and justifying contradictory courses, broke him
down. And when all expectations of drawing advan-
tage through his agency was at an end, hie corrupt
self-seeking and interested following deserted him
without hesitation or compunction. Never was man
more pitifully friendles s than Arthur Maealister attar
a teriasof epileptic fits had shaken hisframe and reduc’d
him to a confirmed valetudinarian. By aa expiring exer-
tion of his old credit and former influence ho procured
the post of Agent-General in London, and never raw
Queensland again. He died poor, friendless, un-
honoured, a pensioner dependent on the charity < f
colony he had misgoverned. He bod years befers
driven his wife from his side by his infidelities. H®
left no eon who inherited aught of his ability, but btf
faults lived anew unqualified by the talents which m
his case so long concealed them. And this was a man
who had enjoyed opportunities of advancing a com-
munity, which long implicitly trusted him, to a height
of prosperity almost beyond conception; who by n*<* e
adherence to the promp tings of honour and the plain
teachings of consistency as against expediency, would

Mr. James Hennessy (who, to our surprise, is
in Tare?) writes to tho Manning Eivkr Times, and
states that tho butohers and bakers there are popping it
on to the price of meat and bread. He says when once
in a crisis the Taree tradespeople raise the price of any
article of consumption they never lower it again. This
makes James Hennessy angry. And no wonder. We
have often been angry ourselves at less than this. We
have bean angry with the •• Intelligent Vagrant.” But
that’s almost less than anything.
A Maitland bank manager, after a year’s resi-
dence, was presented with a £100 set of piste; while an
organist—a fine musician—who has lived twenty-five
years in the same place, to raise the wind had to get up
a ben. and hawk round tha tickets. We think a lot of
this item, because, of course, it was sent to us by either
the organist or his aunt. Onr musical friand, however,
seems to forget one point. There is such a thing as
Jiving in a place too long. Both Peter Campbell and
Dowio know that. Don’t you, boys ?
A Smeaton (Vio.) miner, whilst drinking beer,
states that he found “ a fully-developed lizard” ia the

of course, bound to believe him. Though wo have
never seen any lizards in onr grog, wo have, during
election time especially, beheld several “ fully-dev.eloped
snakes” corkscrewing themselves out of our rum-
bottlo. And what makos this phenomenon more
remarkable than that of the Smeaton miner’s is, that
while that worthy showed his lizard to several people,
nobody was ever able to see onr snakes but ourselves.

It wouldn’t matter much to us here in Austra-
lia that the return of Mr. John Wfietham Boddam.
Whetham, late of H.M. 7 Ird Foot, with his bride, to
Kirkliogton Hall, Nottinghamshire, was the occasion
of tho greatest corroboree seen since bold-Eobin Heod
played his pranks there in Sherwood Forest, were it
not tor the fact that Mrs. John Whetham Boddam.
Whetham happens to have been, some few months
back, Mias Harriet Manning. Io wouldn’t matter to
ns that Mr. John Whetham Boldam-Whetbam had
been travelling for tea long years on many a foreign
strand, had explored almost inaccessible countries,
had written books—all of which he did—only the fact
that he came here, and saw, and conquered, is ene of
the deepest importance, because it is owing to that
that the late Miss Manning now has some “ ancestors,
more or less.” It’s most encouraging to hoar of Aus-
tralian girls getting oa so nicely, the Nottingham-
shire reception was really splendid, but we think they
might have pat off the illumination of things just for
another month—till Uncle William’s arri'va'l. It’s too
bad.
What we like is modesty. Give us an unosten-
tatious man, and we will love him. Wo have found one
after cur own heart. H« lives in fee remote wild West,
and shears an army of sheep annually. Ha has a merry
humour, too. Just for a joks he now and than drives
his neighbours’ sheep into fiis own jard, locks the gate,
and then sands him word to come and take his measly
sheep away or legal proceedings will be immediately
taken against him. This wealthy wag built a palace of
a h.-nse a short time ago, and, when the family were
properly installed in it invited a friend to call round
and see him. When the friend came, (he front room
was in darkne-s. After a delay of a minute or two, the
master of the house came in and struck a match on his
thigh. Then he groped about until he found a slosh
lamp, by tho light of which tho guest saw that the
room was richly famished, and that tbjero was a pair of
magnificent candelabra upon the table. The host ex-
plained that these were only used on special occasions,
at ordinary times they used fat “and all tha like o’
that.” After tea, the daughters rat down to play on a
beautiful piano, and, judging by their performance, the
guest came to the conclusion that this also was only
used on special occasions, and that the fair pianistes
were mostly accustomed to practise tho scales on tho
edge of a pig-trough in the baek-jard. He also fonnd
that all the fine rooms were shut up—except on the
special occasions previously referred to—and that the
family lived in the kitchen like ghouls in a tomb. It is
a good sign when the wealthy class In a community
lives iu such simple style as this—a good sign that
there will be no scarcity of ducks and dr.-kes in the
next generation. Dirt always returns to dirt sooner or
later
The Echo had a long account last week of a man
who has “ tho gift of generating fire through the medium
of his breath ” We know this man wall. He is one of
the leading controversialists on tho Holy Hgwl. He
used to on account of this peculiar quality, a very
hard tifflPbf it when ho was young and giddy. Years
ago, when ho was a simpering curate, the cynosure of
every church-struck miss’s eye—tha centre of every
sowing circle, and the moving spirit of every mnfiia
party—he fell in love with a fair and gentle girl, who
had ft trifle of ready money and a little house property
of her own in a good street, and commenced hia modest
courtship. He met her after divine service one
night, and then But why not tell the melan-
choly truth nt once ? She said hia breath smelt of rum
and scorched her. The fact was undeniable. He had
burnt off bor eyebrows and singed tho hair off a male
on the lop of her dainty nose with his first fell embrace.
The trifle of ready money and tho little house property
vanished into thiij air, and his reputation among his
congregation for sobriety a nil godly living was irrepar-
ably injured from this time forth. He took a, call uome-
where els» as soon as possible. We forget where
past now, but wo think it was to Tiarra del Fucgo.
it was there he fleet obtained his reputation as a fiery
preacher. But one day he let the old Adam-or Old
Nick get the better of his morality and discretion, and
kissed a chiefs daughter. She wasnast heathen in less
than five minutes. Her relations then gathered around
and helped to put her in tbe tomb of her fathers. They
said she was good picking ; but perhaps this was only
the pardonable enthusiasm of people who wanted to
say a good word for their own fl-sh and blood Be that
as it may. from that day forth this light to the Gentiles
was installed as chief cook to tho tribe. They brought
him everything that needed treatment by fire to breathe
qpon. la this way ha assisted in the funeral rites of
many another too sanguine missionary who had come
out with rum and bibles to that unholy island. Tho
end of it was that ha got brok6n-wiuded and asthmatic,
and began to take too long a time in cooking a brisket
of shipwrecked sailor to suit the impatient fancy of
■ ho savages. Just then he was in great danger of being
roasted nt bis own fire, but fortunately an Eng-
as,i man-of-war landed a party cf men on Tierra del
Fnego to take revenge for certain outrages which had
been committed on British subjects fey Solomon
about ten years before, and they resound him
nr a shipped him off He wmj very popular in the fore-
castle, where the men found Um very handy ts a pipe-

To road a recent issue of London Punch any-
one would think that t_be editor had been charing a
double-bedded rocm with Oscar Wildo. They have a
“ poem “ on Ivo Bligh’s team, which, as a sample of
puling idiocy, would bo difficult to beat—even by the
bards that Alfred subsidises. We will give, just to
enlighten our readers, a few samples of the lucubration.
Read this, and sob—
“ Not in it P Get oat with ysur Smeltangns yarns,

At sight of the right slashing scoring of Tyleoote.’’
Con this, and weep—
" And though, like his Captain, he’s bean a bit poorly,
Australians will oft cut their ‘sticks’ before Morley.”
Now, if we wrote like this for our readers, we ehoald
probably be either ignored or kil ed. Yet these lines
were penned by one of the Punch staff, which consists
of Bornand, Albery, W. J. Wills, Henry 8 Leigh, Ashby

was a good show tor n satiri t in Loudon. We begin
to think now that there is a bit of an opening for'a

If it be a desirable thing to be a clergyman —

Hut why toothpicks and key-rings? Why not Ihe

Emerson recommends every man when making a pre-
tent to give something that is a portion of himself—

The South Creek church is to be sold on April
the lltb, and in his advertisements the auctioneer
merely makes tbo preeaio! announcement that he will
sell, on the above date, the Wes’eyan Church, together
with the seats and fixtures. This man has evidently
not a soul above his hammer. Now, had we been
entrusted with the sale of this sacred edifice, wo should
h«ve issued a prospectus something in this style i —“To

Creek, where the sun oasts its glimmer o’er the rippling
waters, and the balmy breszss whisper amongst the
golden com, the-e stands out against the summer sky a

wourne for Baptists. This, strange to say, is to bo

The advantages appertaining to this desirable locality
are numerous. Board is cheap in the neighbourhood,

gregation is pious when sober. There are several ** good

tbo choir is almost exclusively composed of the flower
of the female beauty of the eovsindge. There are three
school picnics a year—pickets a shilling—and
the balance, after expenses, is entrusted to
the minister, to swell a fund (over which he has
sola control) for instructing the Patagoaians in
the gams of draw-poker. The last preacher can testify
to the generosity of the parishioners in the shape of
valedictory offerings; inasmuch as he took away with
him eight pairs embroidered slippers, three albums,
four pairs knitted stockings, seven bottles calf’s-foot
j illy, and a warming-pan, bosidesuumerous photographs
end illuminated scripture-texts, which ha appeared, in
the hurry of packing, to have left behind him. No
previous knowledge of the Scriptures is required at the
hands of the incumbent of this edifice. The retiring
minister was by trade a baker. His delivery, it may be
supposed, was, therefore, floury. A.11 they want here is
to be read to, and then to be allowed to sing as loud and
as long as they like. This is, therefore, a chance

tors and a representative House of four-four members.
In England, it is considered certain Arabi will again
be ruler of the country within two years, England hav-
iug found reasons to distrust the Sultan and rely oa
her quondam enemy.

Mr. Courtney, M.P., discoursing on timidity in
politics, said: “ Thera are some people in the political
world who are eo ofraid of tho appearance of anarchy
that they are ready to declare that they would not
tolerate anarchy even in tho crater of Mount Vesuvius
He protested against the notion that we must go any-
where to prevent anarchy. “The whole excuse of many
of our conquests has been—anarchy requiring onr
intervention; then the excuse for maintaining our con-
quest is that anarchy would follow our withdrawal.
The beauty of this speech is that Mr. Courtney is a
member of Mr. Gladstone’s Government, which under-
took tho war against the Egyptian people.
“ Tho Conservatives are greatly disconcerted,”
says the Woeid, “at the prospect of a Tenant Eight Bill,
which they boo will place thorn in a very awkward posi-
tion. The measure will probably be of a thorough-
going character; and, if it dees not injure the landlord a
property, will inflict a damaging blow upon his political
power. If they oppose it they will offend their princi-
pal supporters—the tenant farmerb ; if they accept it
they will pave their way for their own political annihi-
lation. It is no wonder that they should be pnvatoly
cursing the introduction of a Tenant Right Bill as an
* infernal manoeuvre *■ of Mr Chamberlain.** Tho pecu-
liarity of this paragraph is the tacit assumption that if
a member of Parliament bo a Conservative, he is cer
tainly a landlord. The same is equally true of the
majority of tho Whig members. In the House of Com-
mons the few Radical members alone approximately
represent the ideas of the people of England
The N.Z. Herald comments on the exceptional
action of cur own Hekald thus: —“ The Sidney
Moknxno Hebald Is usually regarded as unique among
colonial journals, for being-all things to all men and
all parties of men. Tho outburst of denunciation
which the Hekald has evoked shows that it is not ex-
peoted that public man of Now South Wales should he
put In the pillory whatever their offending. It i» not
too much to saytkat tho Sidney Mokninq Hebald has
contributed to this sense of immunity, and that had
Sydney journalism manifested in the past the sp’Ht of
fearless criticism which, for example, the Argus or
Age exhibits towards public men in Melbourne, and
nearly every journal would show to the disgraceful
laches of public men in New Zealand, there would not
be fourd so many exhibitions of the more degrading
forms of misbehaviour for which the Sydney Legisla-
ture has been for a long time notorious.’’
In an article on Irish affairs, a Vienna paper,
the Taoblatt, says :—“Irish conspiracy and Irish
crime are the work of the English aristocracy, the
result of tho system of landholding, the fruit of pitiless
oppression, Ireland is the victim, of an evil genius.
She cannot emancipate herself from crime, which is
ever assuming a darker hue. Tho courts of justice will
proceed with severity, heavy punishments wi'l be
inflicted in order to check the movement, but * No. 1 ’
will not be found. ‘ No. 1 ’ is the promoter of every
plot that has been hatched in Ireland for generations.
• No. 1 ’ is net to be crushed. That is the case where,
over there are conspiracies. The minor offenders are
hanged, bat • No. 1 ’ remains a mystery.’’ This is
pretty liberal for an Austrian organ, considering that
Hungary was only yesterday, so to speak, in tho con-
dition of Ireland. Bat, after all. it is only one more
evidence that there is but one civilized country in the
world deal titte cries of Ireland—and that country

League, brought the Fenians to the fore.
The World says that Carey, the Dublin mur-
derer and approver, was, rnly a tew months ago, elo-
quently proposed and effusively seconded by Mr.
William O’Brien, M P , an ’ Mr. T. I). Sullivan. M P.,
for a seat in tho Dnblin Town Council, and that the
nowly-eleoted connoillor was welcomed by Lord Mayor
Dawson in his choicest phraseology to his seat in “ the
conclave of patriots and publicans ’’ in the Dnblin City
Hall. “ Atlas ’’ adds“ From his close
alliance with Mr. Parnell, Mr. Biggar, and Mr. Egan,
it was generally understood, iu Land League circles,
that Mr. Carey would, in due time, be put forward as a
Parnellite candidate for a seat in the House of Com.
mons.” Wo dare say some-of this is quite true; but if
the inference which “ Atlas” wishes drawn is correct,
why don’t Government arrest Parnell, Egan, and Biggar
right off 'i We have heard a great deal about Egan’s
complicity with Caroy having been incontestably estab-
lished by documentary evidence; hnt if Egan is a mur-
derer he can be extradited, and should be tried and
hanged right away.
Sir Henry Parkea got a Roland for his Oliver in
the Assembly on last Thursday night. Mr. M’Langhlin
referred to the member for Wearhat as “ my honorable
friend," and Sir Henry inter j sote'’ " To — not tho hon.
member’s friend " M’Langhlin retorted that he only
used the expression in a Parliamentary sense. He
didn’t suppose ho had lost much in a pecuniary sense
by not being a friend of the hon. gentleman. The
House took tho point and lanvhed, but M’Langhlin
could have put it more neatly by just saying
that of course Parkes never was anybody’s honourable
friend. Which reminds us of a story told of a smart
prisoner, who while conducting his own defence jauntily
alluded to Mr Pnrvea, the Victorian barrister, as “ my
learned friend.” On the counsel objecting to be so
designated the man in the dock apologised in a most
dignified manner, saying “ As Mr. Pntves objects to bo
considered my learned friend, I shall, yonr Honor and
gentlemen of tho jury, content myself in future-by
merely referring to him ns “ my friend ” Mr. Purves
grinned horribly, and didn’t pursue the subject.

The Annual Show and Concert of the Eastern
Suburb? Horticultural Society in St Matthias’s Hall,
last Thursday, was, owing to the wot weather, only a
qualified success. The horticultural display was what
Mr. Joe Thompson would call “ multy.” The concert
in the evening was better. A Mr. Brown occupied the
chair, and drank an alarming quantity of water. Miss
Burns, who looked very pretty in cream silk, with pale
pink paniers ard ha’f sleeves, and real ivy trimming,
did ore Jit to her tutor, Oiammona, but couldn’t sing
often enough to satisfy the audience. A gentleman
sang •' The Parson and the Clerk,” to the apparent
delight cf Dr. Barry, who sat on a front seat, and was
evidently on the free list. The lady vocalists had to
scramble up on the platform, and leave it again as best
ihoy could No one seemed to take any interest in the
stage arrangements, except a terrier dorg, who took
charge of the platform, wagging his tail at the ladies,
and growling at the males who tried to sing comic
songs. The Paddington Brass Band was to have
played, but a merciful dispensation in the shape of
rain stopped it.
We notice that the Apache Indiana have broken
out afresh in Arizona and New Mexico, and having
massacred upwards of 50 white settlers, threaten to
extirpate the whites altogether. Troops sent
ont against thsm they ambushed and annihilated.
It is only the other day that we whisked
through Arizona and New Mexico by railway,
and had pointed out to ns spots historical owing to the
ravages ef these Indians. The Una of the Southern
Pacific Railway runs through level prairies in this
neighbourhood, and along its tr?ck a number of small
towns have sprung up, right in the heart of this Indian
country. To the north and to the south the prairies
extend, flanked and bounded by savage ranges of
mountains, rich in minerals, especially copper Far
. away to the south, on the very frontier of the United
States, these mountains Close the view, and it is be-
yond these, wo w-rre told, the Apaches were located at
the time A long, broad, and bleak prarie, overlooked
on both flanks by tremendous rugged ranges, was indi-
oatfcd as the country up which the Indiana came when
on the war-trail In that valley there was no habita.
tion cr sign of human being. It was a piotapo of bleak
desolation. On one of the spurs of the mountains
which approached the railway line was perched high a
tall chimney, and other signs of a mine. A rich
mine, wo were told, but abandoned. Why ? On
aooonnt of the Indiana. It was more than men’s
lives were worth to establish themselves there.
To the north, the ragged hills were cleft here and there
by ravines leading into the recesses One cf these was
indicated as the “Canyon," into which General
Custer, n couple of years before, led his cavalry,
some SCO strong, and from which neithfr he ncr
300 of his command ever emerged. They were
ambushed by the Apaches, and more than half were
killed. But we were (old the Indians were held well in
hand now General Crcoke was in command, and beyond
that distant southern range he camped right beside the
Apaches, with his troop’. And he mustered the Indiana
frequently, and if he discovered that a score er so of
“ braves ” smitten"with the blood oraze had stolen away
on a war-path, ho went after them with a hundred
troopers, and these Indians never came bapk ! It will
be interesting to hear how they have given Crcoke the
slip this time They are formidable wretches,
splendidly armed with the best modern breeohloading
rifles, and magnificent ehet?, besides being unequalled
horsemen. On one of their last forays they drove down
that valley such herds of horses and cattle, swept from
the settlers’ homesteads, that the very valley seemed in
motion. They galloped all the time, and when one
horse sunk or failed they out his throat and leaped on
to the back of another. It was a queer romance to hear
in a railway carriage, with the very scene of these
incidents under one’s eyes, and “ twenty minutes
here for re roshments ” hardly out of one’s ears.
Every man on that train was armed. Thera
wasn’t a coat-tail but showed an ugly bulge. But this
was more the custom of the country than appre-
hension of Indians. There seemed, to be an im-
preseion that no more wholesale outbreaks were to be
apprehended A branch railway diverges and goes
straight down towards the Indian country just here-
away. If leads to a mining township which bears the
attractive name of Tombstone, said to be given it in
consequence of a prospector, dead broke, having ven-
tured to make bis Eolltary way, despite the certainty of
being killed if the Indians got on his trail—declaring
that he would either find his fortune or his tombstone
in that terrible region. A magnificent discovery of
copper rewarded his desperate quest, and the town,
which was founded by the lode,! is Tombstone to this
day. j

The Amalgamated Miners’ Association of Vic-
toria are agitating for more equitable terms-to tribntors,
improved inspection and ventilation of mines, and the
prohibition of the nse of lithofraoteur, dynamite, and
all nit ro-glycerine compounds, owing to the poisonous
nature ef the fumes. The sufferings of quarts miners
from the latter cause are sometimes terrible. When it
remembered that half a drop of nitro-glycerine used in
medicine often suffices to make a strong man faint, and
that such a dese is in every case sufficient to cause most
excruciating headache, it can readily be imagined
tortures are undergone by men who work in ill-ven-
tilated drives from the fumes of dynamite and lithe-
fraoteur. The Association wants a Mining on Private
Property Act, and mentions that in the Creswick district
three or four times the value of the land was paid for
the right to mine on it. The Seven Hills estate was
bought by a syndicate a few years ago for £36.000, and
already £28.225 hid been repaid them by persons mining
upon it for surface drainage, while they also received
an additional sum cf £17,876 as royalty, and 71 per cent,
on the yield of gold, thus ruining the industry. In-
vestors were now complaining, and rather than continue
the system would close up the mine altogether.

what a pleasant surprise it is to fled that Sir William
the son, is not entirely enwrapped in the ‘ ac-
cumulating instinct" of the old gentleman who is
said to have said: "When I get a thousand a day
I shall die happy." " William Clarke when ho came into
his heritage proved to be an ordinary, good-natured
man, not blessed with brilliant abilities, but well-
intentioned and fairly free-handed. Such a contrast to
his father, of course, jumped suddenly into popularity-
He would have done the State some service no doubt,
for he was well-intentioned j but Providence hac
evidently refrained from wasting inordinate ability on
so wealthy a man. From England ho came back a* •

of welcome to him The simple-minded enthusiasm C1
those addresses was most touching. In one of them

made him a Baronet ! Altogether, the capacity w*

■Religion, says a French sage, is like a corset—it
•nstaius but rqueazos. And Rationalism is like a loose
nair of trousers—too big for the average man. And
Ritualism is like a tight pair of shore --they’re pretty,
they’re uncomfortable. And Faith is like a Trea-
gory billet—it is good, but it’s hard to get.
The Exeter Hall people have engaged Pastor

Three young ladies “took the white veil ” at
St Augustine’s, Tass, recently, before a crowded con-
gregation The ceremony was impressive; ihe three
“postulants" dressed as brides followed the 44 Rev.
Mother 4 ’ of thoConvent in procession, with sisters and
candles, and the E*v. Dsan _ O’Keefe, after
preliminaries, preached an hour’s sermon The
novitiates (natives of Ireland) retired to tha Convent
after a ceremony lasting over two hours and a half.
In London, one old lady who has taken to
“evangelizing” has issued a report on the result of her
work. Sho hung illuminated t- xts in the tap-rooms of
five hundred public-houses. One notable conversion
has convinced her of the efficacy of her method, and tho
instanoe is so charging that it deserves record. 44 An
old soldier," says the good lady, 44 told mo'that he went
d.min and again to the public-house in order that ho
might learn the text by heart. 44 One would ,like to
know that soldier. ‘
Freethonght has just been presented in a curious,
instructive, and favourable light in Dunedin, N Z The
Hon EobartStout, the representative agnostio of Maori-
land, took the chair in tho Freethonght Hall on a rec ant
Sunday, while an orthodox address was delivered by a
Quaker lady. With characteristic courtesy the chair-
man requested the audience to avoid demonstrations
which might bo unpleasant to one unaooustomed to
them, and the assembled Freethinkers respectfully
heard Hannah Hale 4 s exhortation to 44 balieve ia God
and worship Him. 44
The Eev. William Hicks, of America, has taken
libel notions over there against certain New York
Sipers which accused him of refusing to give up
uiteaa’s body for soientiflo purposes unless he was
paid 20,000 dollars down on delivery. Wo really don’t
see why he should not have done this stroke of busi-
ness. Ho was Quiteau’s spiritual adviser, and had
traded oS that martyr’s soul to tho bast advantage,
consequently, in our opinion, he had a perfect right to
the body if only as a returned empty. We don’t know
whatGuitoau thinks of ihe matter. Any of cur readers
who are carious about this, might ask him through the
ocrrospmdeace colamu of the Pbitestant Standard.
We believe it circulates down there.
The Salvation Army in Melbourne haa had a
rough 44 deal.” Berry has rescinded O’Lcgblan’s order
that tho police should not interfere with tho “proces-
sions," and he ordered tho Chief Commisioner to 44 sup-
press all street disturbances.” The Harmy is now
pensive, The demon who operated on tho kornet (we
are always thinking of Alfred) is preparing to go back
to the French polishing, while, the fiend with the con-
certina has for the last two days been fixing np his
koct-shining stand. Bui. tha women are determined to
persevere. They know it they leave this racket, there
is nothing left for thorn but washing. And they don 4 t
like washing—in any form. So each one is prepared to
face tho horrors of a 41 dunging, 44 and to be led (we
quote Mrs. Gamp) 44 a Martha to tho stakes." For
them, therefore, the situation may be said to be
hominyons.
The question has been asked by a correspondent,
whether it is illegal to play cricket on Sunday ? We
are not lawyers—thank Heaven I —and can 4 t pretend to
give an opinion founded on that most uncertain of
bases, the law. But we balieve oriokot-playing, or in-
dalgaxca in any other harmless exorcise, to be not
spesially prohibited. We have read that, but a genera-
tion or so back, it was customary for tha Church of
England clergy to encourage the young men of their
parishes to play cricket on the village green between ser-
vices, and even to take part in the game themielves.
This action was explained to be founded on the idea
of directing tho attention of the youths to innooent
and healthful recreation on tho Lord’s Day, as alte-
gether preferable to leaving young men to cluster round
the beer shop. Sabbatarian legislation has certainly
not iacreased in restriotivencss during the last fifty
years, and as many rectors in England are and were on
the Commission of the Peace, it ia very unlikely that
they would have set the example of dieregard of laws
then existing. As our correspondent very justly points
qnt, it would be strange if there were not the same
right to play orioket as to engage in yachting and boat-
ing on Sundays.
Tho Salvation Army is getting its name up.
A Mrs. Voorhis, of Pittsburg, and her daughter-in-law,
Mrs. Annie Darena, both officers in the Harmy, first
chloroformed Mr. Voorhia when he was drank, but
failing to kill him in that humane manner, put arsenic
in his tea. They had. however, so often spread beetle-
poison upon his bread-and-butter when he was tight,
and pat strychnine in his sugar, that the old man was
practically poison-proof. When »rrested they tearfully
said they forgave the wretched Voorhis, and asked to
be allowed to take their Salvation Army books to prison,
as they feared some of tbe inmates might not have been
converted. Since their incarceration, the Harmy
draws up under their coll window every evening, and
the soldier's sing, with big drum obligato, the following
lovely lyric :—
** Two jolly old girls loved tho radiant light,
So Satan he put ’em in a devil of a plight;
Bat Heaven will deliver each from her cold cell.
And will chase the wicked devil back again to hell.
Ant-ally.ally, ally looyer.
Repent all you that are wicked.
And you’ll all go—ally.ally-looyer !—
Straight to heaven with a flrst-oiafs ticket.”
Salmi Morse is an American enthusiast. Ho
built a theatre, said to cost £20,000, on purpose to
present the Passiqn Play, but tho authorities stopped
Morse issued invitations for a private

ia .aw to touch him. Directly the curtain went up

The Echo has tho enviable privilege of being

ohurch.mouss, but not us. It is a little rag-bag of re-

against the charge of went of vitality in the Church of
England, the following interesting little items may bo
mentioned as having been ref.md to at the Easter
meeting of tha parishioners of St. John’s, Ashfleld, on
Tuesday. A new and more powerful organ has be< n
ordered from England, and is expected to bo in use by
tho end of tho year. The friends of the late Mr. George
Holden contemplate putting in a handsome window to
his memory ; a new stone pulpit, as a memorial to the
late Rev- Thomas Wilkinson, ia also under considera-
tion ; and a few intimate friends of the lats Mr. Hugh
Kennedy propose presenting the ohnroh with a brass
eagle lectern bearing tho memorial inscription. It is
intended, with tha concurrence of the original grantee,
to cell tho present sohoolhouse and land, and to erect a
new Sunday school within the church grounds. While
last, but by no means least, it was resolved to increase
the stipend of tbe incumbent, tha Eev. Dr. Corlotte. to
£400 a year, with parsonage ” O, wise jackdaw I The
purchase of an organ, and tbe commemoration, by win-
dows and stone pulpits and brass leoterns, of three
dead men are evidences of vitality in tho Church of
England, are they ? Aud tho addition to the reverend
gentleman’s screw is another evidence, ia it ? Wo are
willing to grant that it is a proof of tho liveliness of
Churoh of England ministers in scrambling after what
they call filthy lucre—when somebody else holds it, bat
taken at large it is simply tho penny that is planed
on the eye of a corpse to close it for the last time. And
the Churoh of England is the corpse. The Church is
going to bits in this colony for want of a Bishop Moor-
house.

In America a challenge haa been made to a
clergyman who had slandered the theatre, to name a
single State prison which does not hold a preacher.
The prison has not been named yet The Jesuits,
who have bought some valuable property and opened a
college in the island of Jersey, are incurring the anger
of certain “No Popery" gentlemen of that island.
The priests have already been assaulted and thrashed
with a whip in tho public roads, an-1 now they stand a
chance of being expelled from the place. Some of tho
inhabitants have petitioned for their removal It is
reported that Mormonism is spreading among the
Waikato natives The English Salvation Army
created great national outbursts of fun in Paris. At
one time in the principal streets, it is computed 250,000
were laughing. Daudefe is writing a theatrical romance
of tho affair There is hut one Jew in the British
Army. The Hebrews have just now far more Eenee

Discussing the question of infidelity, the Witnfss
(Sydney) recommends as a remedy for it that the
clergy should fill their pews I This sort of ad-

the one thing the present clergy cannot do
In February, at Hereford. England, a captain and a
lieutenant and five other officers of the Salvation Army
ware fined, the two former 25s. and costs, or twenty-one
days, and the latter £1 and costa or fourteen days, for
brawling in the streets to the annoyance of the public.
This was the second conviction of members in eight
days A Eev. Mr. Davidge, of tho Paddington Hall,
London, “went out in the highway” with very
indifferent success As soon as ho commenced his
ministrations, the residents commenced theirs. Fling-
ing open their windows, they flung out the toi.trays and
frying-pans and similar musical instruments, and
sprung rattles. A largo and unappreciative congre-
gation was attracted, and Mr. Dividge, yielding to the
persuasion of tho police, retired into tho hall, his
countenance illuminated with ardour and eggs
In Melbourne (Vie.), William Shepherd, leader of
the Salvation Army, has been fined £5 and £5 5; costs
for marching with his followers through the streets
singing, and thereby causing annoyance to the citizens

WOMAN ITEMS.
Her Majesty the Queen rapidly recovering.
A lady, who is among the leaders of London
society, recently underwent a painful and dangerous
but happily successful surgical operation, the technical
name of which we forget, but it means the removal of
the kidney. Not more than eighty of these operations
have been pertormed in the entire world, and only about
half of them were successful A proposal to lecture
upon this special case to medical students was sternly
opposed by the husband of the unfortunate lady, who
wrote to the surgeon that be had permitted the opera-
tion to be performed because it was the only means of
saving his wife’s life, and not for the purpose of advan-
cing surgical science; and, furthermore, that if this
case were made the theme of a lecture he would adopt
legal proceedings. Upon this, the surgeon who had
charge of the case, and was also to have been the
lecturer, immediately replied that he certainly would
not do anything to awaken ill-will, and that the lecture
weuld not be delivered.
Two Greenock ladies have been committed, poor
things I for killing a paltry baby. They were, it seems,
in the habit of tossing it np to the ceiling and letting
it fall to the ground. One day its head didn’t happen
to fetch a soft plank, and it was killed. The indigna-
tion in the neighbourhood was general, when they' were
arrested; and the landlord gained much popularity by
giving the women’s husbands notice, and expressing a
determination to sue them for damaging his flooring.
The defence will be, we believe, that they didn’t think
any harm would ensue, the Scotch being notoriously a
hard-headed race.
It is proposed, in England, to tax pianos. To
do so, it it urged, would reduce a nuisance, and raise
an immense revenue. Among the arguments are, that
42 per cent, of the young women who die of consump-
tion would be alive, hale and hearty, if the time they
spent piano-dabbing had been devoted to open air and
exercise. Second, that if a man has to pay five shil-
lings a year for a dog, *5 would not be too much to
expect from a woman for a piano, which she doesn’t
have to feed. Third, that the lives of 53 per cent of
the men who die from soured temper and shattered
nerves, through “the piano next door,” would bo
saved —to the eternal advantage of old maids. It will
thus be seen that there are " magnificent possibilities’*
in the piano as a taxable article.

from a Berlin paper:—“A medical student, whose
means are exhausted, would like to meet with someone
who would advance him the necessary sum to complete

the Mothers, wives, and maids of England. It seems
the principal helps to this sad result are confectioners
and grooera. The British belle simply walks in and
tells the party behind the counter, 44 Mine’s a raspberry
balm," or “abottle of lime juice," and then she looks
like this, and puckers her mouth like that, and —well,
as the old historians who lived before Heaton’s time
used to say, 44 the whole world knows what follows.”...

“THE POOR PLAYER”
[Correspondence is invited from members of the theatrical
profession.]
Melbourne theatre-managers complain cf the
unjust competition to wbioh they are subjected by the
“religious shows.’’ bazaars, and so on—the old-time
lucky bag and rsffls expedients having been superseded
by all the adjuncts of a well-worked-up “show." Star
singers from the opera, dancers, actors, juvenile i rodi-
gies from Mrs. Lewis of the B’jou, the Fakir of Oolu,
are among a few of the items which that section of the
public which abj area theatres can witness now under
the exouso of benefiting the church There was the
usual row in Christchurch, lately. Jennie Left’s
manager, Mr. Qanose, mot Mr. Solig, proprietor of a
wretched rag called Society, and called him several
things, Selig summoned Qenese, and wanted to have
him bound over to keep the peace; but the magistrate
couldn’t see it. It seems that Salig said “things"
about Jennie Lee, and Genese wanted to Alfred Moul
him. As au.ual thing, we don’t believe in-Alfred
Mouling critics, unless they say a performance 4 took
well and gave pleasure to all." In this case we
will cheerfully support the policy of managers who
remonstrate through the medium of a little hatchet..
There is nt the Russian Church in Paris a basso who

Griffin" In New Zealand, Macnllum’s Company is
called th« 44 The Tambour Masher Troupe." A
certain London doctor says that 44 stimulant foods and
strong liquors, by provoking a certain congestion of the
larynx, make the voice lower. Therefore tenors are
sober, and avoid alcoholic drinks." They stay at home,
then. Very few of those wo have mot out here put any
faith in the theory of this doctor Companies which
have been playing in the country are returning in
flocks And as they returned in flocks, wo suppose they
flew back? Not so. J. B Steele’s company, came
back comfortably the other day bv a real steamer, after
a short and artistically successful season in Grafton
So tha streets now are made blithe and brilliaxt by the
appearance therein of Harry Jordan, Do Percy,
Andrews, West, 44 Mario Wilton,” Bessie Vivian, Mrs.
Leake, and other fair and familiar faces.
Vanity Fair absolutely gushes over Alice
Dunning-Lingaid, and gueh from Vanity Fair is very
rare. Lucky Alice ! Says onr contemporary, amongst
a great many other th’ngs :— 44 Miss Lingard is so wel-
come an addition to (ho English stage that Tuesday’s
mating j at the Gaiety is altogether notable. For her
first appearance the i»dy f elected the part of Camille
in an English adaptation of 4 La Dame aux Carcdlias."
The choice is a bold one, and made all the bolder by
the comparison it challenges It was justified by the
result .... In the firyt act Camille is the reck-
less, hollow hearted creature of pleasure. Miss Lingard
mocks at the name of love with such perfect hcartlces-
uess that you doubt whether emotional expression is
within her power The ceoond and third acts, however,
set ut rest all dcubt on this score. In passages of quiet
tenderness Miss Lingard is at her best, and it is strange
how much effect she produces by her graceful, clinging
attitudes, each of which is in itself a caress. In the
whole of the seccnd aob. working up to the moment
where she tears np his rival’s letter and throws herself
into Armand s arms, she is excellent. Again at the end
of the third act there is a very happy touch. She is
parting from Armnnd, as the thinks for over. Leaving
him is useless, for he would follow; telling him she
does not love him would avail as little, for he would not
credit it. Her one chance of breaking with him for
ever is to make him despise her. With (his intent she
is leaving the place, her heart ail the time full of a
great love for him. But though sho has hardened her-
self for the sacrifice, and written the very letter wbioh
shall turn his love into contempt, this last interview
must be one of kindness. Gentle looks and gentle
words must bo ihe last memories of her love. So the
implores her lover to give her back unopened the letter,
which presently is to be returned to him when the is
gone. All this Miss Lingard does with w-ndrous
pathos. Her death scene in the last act is an original
and pretty conception. Earnestness, originality, and a
touch of electric sympathy make Mies Lingard’s per-
formance a very nnc immon one. It would bo interest-
ing to see her as Fedora, it it were possible-" All
this reminds us that the London critics, who are sup-
posed to know their way round, refer to Alice as the
young debutante," and talk about what she’ll do
when she 41 overcomes her natural nervcuEnesa."...The
Berlin Ziologioal Society’s elephant has killed its

ave been well represented in the
***8 dgriag the past week. In Melbourne,
’’ • the winner of L. L, Smith’s go-as-you-please
belt, sued J. Taylor for illegal detention of the trophy.
And, in Sydney, Young Du toby sued. O’Leary for £10,
alleged training expenses; and a carter named Kenny
charged Larry Foley with assaulting him by striking
him in the mouth, cutting his lip and injuring his jaw
to such an extent that he could not eat for tour days.
In both the latter oases the complainants were non-
suited.
Once upon a time — we believe it was in Running
Rein’s year—a certain horse won the English Derby,
which we need scarcely say is a race for three-year-olds
solely. Thirty-six months after this a rumour got
abroad that the winning horse was a flve-year-older
under a false name. It was then decided (the horse
having died the same year) to dig this winner out of
his grave, and examine his teeth—this being the only
reliable teat to stand on. So the grave was opened, and
it was then found that the horse was headiest. Now,
why can’t we start a little row of our own on the
same principle ?
Fashionable Intelligence.—It is our privilege to
be able to chronicle in advance of our contemporaries,
the fact that Sir Frederick Hanstead (sometimes mis-
called “Young Datohy”) is about to leave town shortly
for Tamworth. where, ha informs ns, he Is going to
“start a ‘jimmynasinm.’" We have it, also, on excel-
lent authority, that Thomas Sayers, Esq, at present
resident in the metropolis, is about to take a country
tour and sing “ comic " songs to the rustics borne
new lyrics of a local character having been written for
him, Mr. Sayers contemplates calling his entertainment
“The Polly •tic-nick.” The word “ tic ” would seem to
us, though, to have rather an ominous sound. But
then that’s only our own evil conscience.
Tears ago a once-prominent ring-man was
making a book upon a race, and offered to lay 1000 to
300 on the Held. “ I'll take it,” was exclaimed by a
well-dressed gentlemanly man standing jnst behind
him. and anxious to do business, he consented to book
the bet, which he won. On the following Monday at
Tattersall’s he eagerly awaited the advent of his debtor,
who, as the clock struck 5, rushed hurriedly into the
room. Apologising for the delay on the plea that his
train had broken down, be pulled out a note for £1000,
and asked for change, which was gladly given, and
artay went the sharp customer with his £700. Upon
paying the £1000-note into bis banker's hands, the as-
toni shod'book maker was told that it was a stolen note,
and that payment of it had been stopped.
The billiard match between Mitchell and Cook,
resulted in a hollow victory for Mitchell by no fewer
than 1639 points ont of the 3000. Cook, who in prac-
tice had satisfied his friends that ho was in excellent
form—so much so that what betting there was at the
start ruled at 11 to 10 on him—was quite unable to make
way, and not once did he score a hundred off the balls.
The Sheffielder, ou the contrary, with such runs as 7o9
(the largest on record in a money match) and 482, un-
finished, manipulated his one with a nerve and
brilliance which stamps him an quite the beat player
yet seen, at any rats on an ordinary table. The result
of the contest presents a striking contrast to that of
the first meeting between the same players twelve years
ago, when Mitchell, a boy of sixteen, received 500 points
in a thousand from the ex-champion, and was beaten
by 42.
It is very likely that our representative eight-
oar crew will pull their race against Victoria in the
Melbourne boat, as the craft supplied by Donnelly and
Sullivan doesn't sooure the approbation of all the men.
On the other hand, the new elght-oar built by Fuller
for the Victorians suits them admirably. In their
maiden row they got hold of her to a nicety, and seemed
quite at home in the first quarter mile. The latest
about the Melburnians is that they went for a trial pull
the other evening, having previously ordered a steamer
to give them a spurt. As however the launch was touud
quite useless in point of speed, the oarsmen being able
to leave her at any moment, m> index of the staying
powers of the orow could be obtained. The Victorians
will be ou the Parramatta ere the end of the week.
Here are the measurements of their boat: Length, 57ft.;
beam, 23in.; depth, ; midships, fifin. forward and
fiiin. aft; sides, 18m. ; the skin is of Queensland cedar,
the fittings and timber being American white pine. The
boat was built for an list all round orew, and is a sister
oraft to that built by Fuller last year for our men.

A correspondent of the Melbourne Argus, writ-
ing from London, relates the following;—Mr. Thomas
Burnside, ih American journalist, had been invited to
Margate by his friend, Lord Arthur Hill, to play in a
“ muff ’’ match. He was a stranger to the people of
Margate, and was evidently not an Englishman. As he
proved to be a good orioketer, it was at once assumed
that he was an Australian, and when he began to hit
the bowling all over the field, the crowd shouted, “ Go
it, Australia I” to his great amusement. The same
mistake was made by the local journal, which thus
described the position .—“A new element of interest
wag imparted to the match on Saturday by the presence
of an*Australian amateur, not included in the eleven,
who recently visited this country, but desirous of join-
ing issue with the now famous players of this neigh-
bourhood. Messrs. Sopwith and White were elected
to choose sides; the former was fortunate enough to
secure the Australian gentleman, and by way of com-
pensation the latter was allowed the services of the
professional ground man, Hagget.” It is scarcely
necessary to say that the side whioh had “ secured the
Australian gentleman ’’ won the match easily.
The fleet meet this season of the Northern Hunt
Club hounds took place at Burwood on Saturday last,
and that generous and enthusiastic huntsman, Mr.
Edward Terry, oould not have been otherwise than
gratified at the number of horsemen who responded to
his invitation. Amongst the straight-goers were
noticed the Master, £. Terry, on Lord of the Forest,
the huntsman, Harry Lodge, on Zoe, W. Chi fin oy ou
Cygnet, T. Lucky on Langar, T. Cosgove, senr, on
Killarney, B. P. Pickering on Lady Power, W. Cos-
grove, junr., on Prophet, James Cosgrove on lago,
John Cosgrove on Mazeppa, T. Banoh on Jona,
J. Hogan on Othello, T. Bobertson on Heotor,
W. 8. Hayes on Duke. T. Salter on Commodore,
8‘. Nott on Booket, S. Thornthwaito on Prince,
F. Thornthwaito on Chieftain, Q. Mason on Neddy
M'Carthy, H. Archer on Eva, J, J Grey on Eclipse, C.
Parnell on Frolic, J. Abbott on Mormon, L Martineer
on Vril. While preparations were being made, M'Crow,
the whip, mounted on Merlin, stole away with the drag.
The run oould not have been far short of ten miles, and
pome good fencing was dona by Lord of the Forest,
Zoe, Cygnet, Lady Power, Duke, Eclipse, Vril, and
several others. The next meeting takes place at Bjde
on Saturday.
It is recorded in one of the sporting papers that
in December, 1815, Lord Carmarthen, at Hornby
Castle, Yorkshire, leaped a brook whioh was bank fall.
The leap, on being measured next day, from hind foot
to fore foot, was 26ft 9in. The horse ho rode was but
two years old, and one of the most speedy of his day.
About twenty-five years ago, the owner of an Irish
horse, for a wager jumped over the wall of Hyde Park,
close to the gates at Hyde Park Corner. The height of
the wall on the side on which he rode was six feet and on
the other side of the wall, was eight feet high The
horse was about fifteen hands high, without anything
remarkable in his general appearance. He was led up
to the wall to within the distance of half-a-dozen yards,
when he was turned loose. In going over it, however,
he knocked off a brick with his hind leg. A -lisp ate
arising from that circumstance, ho was brought round
again to the same place, when he cleared the wall In the
most perfect manner at the second time of trial. This
leap, considering the great height of it, and it taking
place over such a hard and unyielding sub stance ns a
brick wall, appears almost incredible; but the author
con vouch tor its being a fact, he having been an eye-
witness on the occasion. On Saturday last, in the ran
after the Northern Hunt Clnb hounds, at BurWood,
€!ygnet, ridden by W. Ghitney, performed the wonder,
ful feat of clearing a paling fence six feet high, with
which performance the owner, Mr. Driscoll, was so well
pleased that he at once withdrew him from the run, in
order to save him for more profitable things.
Judge Donohue, of New York, hating virtually
settled the question as to the legality of ff iendly spar,
ring entertainments, the postponed exhibition, get
up for the benefit of Mace, Slade, and their backer,
came off at Madison-sqnare Gardens, N. Y., on February
8. The management, in anticipation of an immense
attendance, doubled the prices of admission, making
them 4s. to enter the building, 8s. reserved seats, and
£5 private boxes, but they made a mistake, as only 1800
spectators in all were present, which number included
a strong posse of policemen and detectives, together
with a goodly number of other "dead-heads.’’ Finan-
cially the affair was a sore disappointment to those who
had expected so much, falling hundreds of peunds
beneath their expectations. After some sparring and
wrestling, Mace and Slade presented themselves.
Many had been under the impression that Sul.
livon would put in an appearance about this
time as he had done on previous occasions,
but those who thought so were disippoiuted, as Sullivan
remained in Boston. The impression made by the Maori
was favonrable, although the opinion was general that
as between him and Sullivan, with whom the spectators
naturally compared him, the latter was the better pro.
portioned and more evenly developed ef the twain.
Considering the short time Mace has had Slade under
his tuition, he has imparted a considerable knowledge
of the art of self-defence to his seemingly apt pupil,
bat Slade's performance showed he had not a deal of
confidence in his own powers; and from his actions
when hurried by Mace, it was seen that if forced by a
good man he would be liable to got flurried, and be
more inclined to give way than to fight forward. It
was also noticed most of his hitting was done open-
banded, with the inside of the point of the glove—slap-
ping rather than striking—certainly bad practice for a
man who threatens to fight a hard hitter like Sullivan.
However, while rather favourably impressed regarding
his appearance, the general opinion amongst the know-
ing ones seemed to be that the New Zealander lacked
the natural fighting ability and tremendous kitting
power of Sullivan, whose friends are not disposed to
regard him as a specially formidable antagonist.
The mueh talked off match between Sullivan and
Slade, seams as far off as ever. Mace says in a pub-
lished card :—“ In matches for the championship the
battle is seldom arranged to take place in less than six
months from signing articles. I have fought over a
dozen battles for the championship, and have always
had from four to six months in which to prepare myself.
Slade has been only a short time in America, and it
would be unfair to ask him to fight in the time specified
by S alii van. Ifhohadhisowuwayhe would fight no w,
but his backer and myself will not consent to his ar-
ranging a match unless he has reasonable time to pre-
pare himself. Slade, in my opinion, is able to fight any
man living, and ha will fight Sullivan any time s'X
months after signing articles. Aeoerding to the rules
of the London prize ring for the championship, a pugi-
list is allowed six months as the limit, at the end of
which, if challenged, he must relinquish the claim or
fight." Sullivan who evidently means fight, has re-
plied with the following:—“ I don't want any six
months about it, as Slade’s backer proposes. If he
moans business, five weeks is enough for any man to
train and get himself in fine trim. If Slade won’t make
a match, I will follow him and the combination up
and challenge him at every place he stops to give an
exhibition. In the good old days of Tom Hyer, Yankee
Sullivan and John Morrissey a match was made and
the fight came off without the party going around
through all the States in the Union giving exhibitions.
I want to call Mane's attention to what he told a Sou
reporter on Jan 27. He remarked: ‘We don’t want
any glove-hippodroming. I want Slade to fight a battle
with the bare knuckles in a 24-foot ting; that's what I
came here for.’’ Now, I see the Maoe-Slade Combine-
tlon is advertised to travel about the country giving
exhibitions. It seems to me Mace has changed his
mind very quickly. If Slade’s backer will name time
and place where a match can be made safely, my backer
will bo ready to meet him and put up a forfeit of not
less than $2500 a side as a first deposit. I don’t care
for the championship of the world, but claim the
championship of America, and will let no foreigner
take it away from me without a hard fight. I want
this to bo my last fight, win or lose. After the fight I
will retire from the ring. Where there has been so
much smoke there ought to be some fire, and it is about
time that the fire showed itself. I hope that they will
now stop all this newspaper talk and come to business,
and I will leave it to the publio to judge who moans
fight.’’

It was a wedding of more than usual prettinesa
that enticed so many to St. Mttthias’s last week, when
the Hon G iorge M'Evoy, of F ji, took—for better,
we’re aura-J-Misa Ada Bettington to wife. The bride,
who is very handsome, in a superb robe of white satin,
veil, etc., was naturally punctual, bother Maids dallied j
so a dark-qyed bade, very anxious to prevent any bitch
(except the “ hitch” they had come to see) started eff
in a cab, and soon returned with the lovely assistants
for the ceremony, while “ the voice that breathed o’er
Ed. n” continued doing so to All up the time. Plenty
of (liners, choral service, and floral arches. Misses
Salwey, Nellie Ward. Hich, aad M Millan were brides-
(Maids', in excellent toilets of white and gold—the white,
no doubt, to show their beauty, and the gold as an
emblem of their worth; and a prettier quartet seldom
ranged before an altar. To Mendelssohn's March, the

Intensely happy—proceeded out to the carriages;

was held on the 4th. Each member wears an em-
blematic flower, and takes his other name from it, ssoh

opening is presented tor turning pretty compliments iu
those occasionally blank intervals when you’re not
turning the lady herself. A dozen dances, including
the now French cotillons, first seen in Sydney last
year, and sapper, constituted a pleasant evening's occu-

Thsro ia really something new under the sun,
and the lady ttallholders of the Bazaar just closed at
the G'.aratnis Hall have the honour of originating tho
excellent idea. It connate of a ball, or rather a dance,
at the termination of a bazaar, to which tho ladies
invite those goatlemen who have patronised their
schema for raising the dollars. Tho success which
attended tho inauguration of tho idea may well en-
courage promoters of other bazaars to adopt it. Aad
what an incentive is now otfored to the steraer sex to
frequent those places which they have hitherto re-
garded with dread. Think how tho prospect of an
evening’s dance with tho fair pirates will cause tho na-
sophisticated male to invest in smoking caps that will
not fib him, dolls for which ha has no possible use,
braces that ho does not wear, and baby’s clothes that he
dare not take. Tbs hope of a polka with that charm-
ing Utile dark beauty would miko him disgorge even
his last tram-ticket; and the chance of a waltz with
that tall, dashing girl, would tempt even a miser to
bankrupt himself in the purchase of all that her fair
arms might bring to him. About 5') gentlemen assembled
at the bazaar in question at the invitation of Mssdames
Butcher, Hart, Brennan and Coffey. Tho mnsio
was excellent, the refreshments were plentiful and
good; the floor was in excellent condition —so the
closing hoar came on with lightning speed. Some of
the drosses were very pretty. A young lady from
Moore Park wore white satin, pale blue plu-h and
forget-me-nots Tho youngest daughter of tho Mayor
of Woollahra looked rather attractive in blue: and a
young lady from Palmer-street, who created great
havoc amongst the men. was charming in cream Indian
muslin and cardinal satin. A pretty brunette from
Qaeen-street, Woollihra, whom many considered to be
the belle, wore blaok satin, pasaemeuterie trimmings,
coiffure and white laoe and roses. Cream muslin and
lace skirt, with bodies and paniers of blue plush, was
worn by one young lady stallholder, while another
wore ivory satin and scarf of shade! orimson. The
most elegant dress in tho room was that of a lady stall-
holder from Waver ley, which consisted of blaok satin,
embroidered with flowers, trimmings of cream and
blaok.

Tho second Tradesmen’s Ball was held at Pen-
rith oaths 30th March, about fifty being present, many
in fancy attire One was in tho tasteful costume of a
Batoher, while another sportive youth represented a
Nepean Footballer, a fearful speoiman of the genus.
Miss G lie and Miss Breeze helped to make the affair
"windy." Good music and a supper made the pro-
gramme an easy task. The local journalist observes
that prior to the first ball " we were besieged with cor-
respondence and personal interviews relative to the
costumes which would best suit the fair ones,” but
naively confesses that on the second occasion " wo wore
not troubled quite so much,” 01 osnrse not,

Competition cuts things so flue now, that it’s no

man who wants to get on at once, looks out for a

crusty bachelors with wives. "Nothing charged it no - ,

afternoon, in the Protestant Hall. A few professionals
also aided. A littlo nervousness was visible, but the
voices were good, and a duet by Signora Fabris and

deprecated. The following ware singers Misses K.
Watt, A. and B. Spencer, Halligan, F. Speer, L King,

Sir Patrick Jennings just dropped down from

Tho money goes to rescue children —tho outcast, the
homeless arab, and the wail of thooity streets; and to
succour old ladies, of good character, who hays nearly
« reached the bottom of the hill" It is a good object,
a noble one; and yet just a little incongruous, to ace
tho money which ia to reclaim these dirty small boys,
aud qoothe the latter years of these ancient dames,
(titering through such dainty hands. And when yon
tao the squeezing, coaxing, and manoeuvring to get that
money out, you can’t help wondering just a littlo at the
burdensome amount of spontaneous charity some

The Bayly-Marks Wedding
Darling Point seldom has its quietude diatmbed
by suoh a wedding as that of yesterday afternoon,
when Miss Florence Marks, daughter of the Hon
John Marks, M.L.C., of “ Glenrook,” was married
to Mr. Paget Bayly, sou of the late N. P. Bayly,
the celebrated wool-breeder, of 1 ' Havilah,’
Mudgee. All the forenoon, busy hands ware at
work with garlands and festoons of flowers which
were sent in lavish abundance to beautify the
pretty, old English-lookiug church. Long before
the momentous hour of half-past 2, along the high-
ways and up the byways, from all around and
near and far, ladies —aye, and gentlemen, too —
came hasting to St. Mark's. From the large
mansions, the snug villas, and the gates of the
trim-kept gardens and sylvan Edens in which the
picturesque “Point” abounds, they- came in
a stream; for the wedding was one ®f
fashion and wealth. The road was lined with
carriages on both sides, and amid the flutter
of the whispering expectant crowd, the
bridal party came slowly up the winding road,
and catered the gates. A frantic pushing bespoke
the eagerness to get a peep, as they went in, of
the bride and her maids. In all the gleaming
splendour of their wedding raiment, they p issed
in procession up the nave to the decorated chan-
cel. There, surrounded by all the beauty of
colour, the fragrance of flowers, and the close-
packed throng of parents, friends, and rich-robed
guests—theie, in the subdued soft light that
slanted through the stained windows on the radiant
scene, they plighted troth. The organ pealed, the
full choral service was performed, and the Rev.
Thomas Kemmia officiated. Then, when the final
words were spoken, and the wedded pair retired
to the vestry, for the bride to sign for the last
time her maiden name, the hush was broken, and
with one universal accord the pent-up female
heart burst out in “ dress.” Was it any wonder ?
Was ever such dress seen there before ? Probably
never : certainly not on so queenly a bride. With
a calm befitting her splendid beauty,
the qmbsdimont of full and perfect grace, with
rosea pink and pearly vising for mastery in the
healthful cheeks —they had soon her sweep up the
nave in a creation of the milliner’s skill that Was
worthy such a bride. Let us say as nearly as we
can what it was:
A dress superbly made, of rich ivory duchesse
satin, with flounces of finest Flanders p int lace
and seed pearl fringe completely covering the
front of skirt, which was draped at top with extra
wide lace and lace panic rs. At the bottom of
the dress was a frill of satin edged with real gold
lace, having white lace underneath to display the
effect. The perfect fitting bodice, made with
antique ridges on the shoulders, was also covered
with lace, and laced down the back; and round
the neck was a ruffle of Brussels white
blossoms. Long bouffant satin train, with fes-
toons of lace falling over a rich full flounce. The
bride's fan was in itself a valuable curio, manu-
factured of white satin and ivory, with intricate
devices of birds and flowers, and a lion worked in
lace on the centre of it. Pearl jewellery and
splendid gold cross set with diamonds ; white
satin shoes ; Honiton lace vest, caught up with
diamond pins ; and thick wreath of orange blos-
soms, myrtle, and clematis, completed the bride’s
equipment. Mrs. John Marks, the handsome
mother of the bride, was robed in olive ottoman
silk and brochd elaborately embellished, velvet
bonnet to match, and scarlet flowers,
All the bridesmaids, ten in number, wore splen-
did white satin dresses and silver neckties. Al l
were trimmed with fine lace, and large bouquets
of roses, five coral pink and five crimson. All
wore beautiful Rubens hats of white lace to match
their dresses, trimmed with clusters of roses, coral
pink and crimson, and fastened with pearl pins.
The ladies’ names were Miss Bayly, Miss Parnell,
Miss Marks, Misses E. and S. and Ida Marks,
Misses Thorne and E. Thorne, Miss Williams, and
Miss King. A tiny sister in white satin, with
small cavalier in ruby velvet, walked behind them.
The costumes of the guests and friend* who
thronged the edifice, formed a gorgeous kaleido-
scope of colours, but it is impossible to give more
than a few. Mrs. S. Marks of Kiama, wore a
black satin morveilleux and brocade, trimmed with
lace and jet; Mrs James Marks, a brown brocaded
gros d’<5ooaso, all aglow with the shifting sheen
of iridescent beads ; and Mrs. Hill, a handsome
sago green satin, trimmed with rich Limerick
lace. Mrs. King’s dress was a rich electric
blue ottoman silk, combined with shaded vel-
vet, and worn with a hat matching it in
stylo and colour. Mrs. Connell's black velvet
was embellished with lace and black brocade.
Mrs. John Fraser wore brown orooaded satin,
cream plush bonnet and feather, honiton lace
collar; Miss Fraser, stylish ruby velvet and fawn
cashmere, felt hat and cream feathers ; Mrs.
Speer wore black velvet with real white lace and
silk flounces; Mrs. W. Russell, of Balmain, dark
blue brocade and duohessa satin to match, with
chenille fringe, real Flanders lace round neck and
sleeves, and train of brocade; her pretty modest-
coking daughter, soft cream satin draped with
embroidery, and a brocaded bodice decked with
mellow lace, silver round neck, wrists, and waist;
and coral ornaments —a most unique ensemble ;
Mrs. Bedford, black satin merveilleux, with a rich
now lace of antique type: and precisely similar
in attire wore the Mrs. Moore White, and
the daughter of the late Mr. fe. D. Gordon ; Mrs.
Montague Levy had a fine black satin, the
bodice and front being a mass of splendid
jet work, tortoiseshell fan. Mrs. Kinross,
from dt. Andrews' College, displayed black silk,
white bonnet; Mrs. Thorn, black velvet dress and
bonnet, cream flowers; and her handsome
daughter-in-law (nee Bundle) a magnificent cream
satin; cardinal velvet leaves formed the bonnet,
aided by pink plush and feathers, looking very
lovely. The Mayoress was apparelled in helio-
trope figured satin, panier bodice, and train, deep
flounces of honiton lace, and the presentation
jewellery ; plaid bonnet. A sister of the bride-
groom wore prune moire jacket, cream satin skirt,
and gold passementerie ; cream princesse bonnet.
The ex-Treasurer’s wife was in satin broche, top
of peculiar pink shade, with Elizabethan collar,
satin de lyon skirt, and bonnet en suite ; and Miss
Lyons, in cream satin broche top and brown velves
skirt, cream and brown bonnet ; two of the
handsomest dresses there. Wedding March,

“ Dick ” Lee—Richard Egan Lee — is dead. He

letters because, unfortunately, in this country, there
was no opportunity for him to acquire opulence by
letting himself out as a hop pole. Lick was the thin-
nest man wo ever met. We remember him years ago
on the Melbourne Herald, and even then he was like
a shadow i.ucnedsideways. There was over upon him a
set tled gloom which could only environ a man who con-
tributad to a crime paper. He used to write the whole
of an Adelaide weakly j mrnal for five-and-twenty shil-
lings. He wielded a caustic pen, and was in every
sense a thorough Bohemian. Hia last years were em-
bittered by sickness and poverty. Falel Dick Leo.

a farewell banquet was tendered to the retiring Go-
vernor of Queensland, His Excellency Sir Arthur
Kennedy, and his daughter j aud in compliment to
Miss Kennedy, a large number of ladies, for the first
time, graced a public banquet at Toowoomba, which
place was the vice-regal summer retreat. In the
gallery were a band and many spectators. The Mayor,
Mr. W H. Grdora, ML.A, was chairman, and pro-
posed His Excellency's health, alluding to him as the
soundest and beat Constitutional Governor Queensland
had seen j also to his interest in schools, his impar-
tiality in politics, and his happy social influence. To
Miss Kennedy were given two beautiful albums, with
engraved silver plates, containing views of the pic-
turesque spots around Toowoomba. His Excellency
responded tersely, and thought that a continuous
career of fifty-five years in the service of the King and
Queen entitled him to retire. “From 1827 to 1883,"
said the veteran, “ I have never been a day idle. I now
go home, and I will retire my own master, and I will
retire a contented man. I will go with clean hands
and not very full pockets.”

The special feature of this Company is the fairness
with which both depositors and borrowers are dealt
with.
The Company is prepared to make temporary ad-

or fortnightly repayments while the building is in
course of erection.
Loans may be repaid at any time, interest being
chargeable upon the actual amount lent, from the date
of loan till the date of repayment only.
Every oare has been taken to save the borrower any
unnecessary expense, and to charge him intereit only on
the amount lent, and not upon the amount applied far,
as is usually the case. D ipositors with the Company
receive not only a fair rate of interest for their money,
but will also participate in the profits. This advantage,
which it is only fair that depositors should receive, has
never been afforded them by any other bank or building
society in New South Wales.
Depositors may withdraw the whole or part of their
deposits at any time without previous notice, receiving
interest at the rata of 5 per cent, per annum for the
period of deposit.
