How to Meet the Deficit.
The Bulletin.
SATURDAY, JANUARY 30, 1886.
On the accession to office of the Stuart
Government, the Public Treasury was found
to be overflowing. Previous Administra-
tions, by following the unwise policy ef
parting with the fee simple of the land, had
succeeded in creating a considerable sur-
plus. Whether, according to Sir H. Parkbs,
the superficial area alienated during his
regime was less than that transferred dur-
ing his predecessors’ rule is now of little
moment. The surplus was the result of the
land sales. For an overplus so created men
deserve far more blame than praise. There
are many foolish ways of raising a revenue.
The most stupid of all is that of parting
with the land—the ultimate source of all
wealth—not alone to those who intend to
cultivate and occupy it, but to many who
have no such intentions. The statesman
who proudly points to a revenue so obtained
is in much the same position as the trader
who classes as legitimate profit the sum
obtained for a share in his business. The
present deficit in the colony’s balance-sheet
is due to the partial suspension of land-sales
combined with a reckless disregard of ex-
penditure, as exemplified notably in the
abortive Soudan expedition, the money for
which wild adventure might just as well
have been sunk in the sea.
- • •
At present, however, the question of para-
mount interest is that of the making good
the deficit of over a million sterling result-
ing from the causes we have named. In his
speech at Mudgee, the present Premier, Sir
J ohn Robb rtson, gave in his adhesion to a
method which, ho anticipated, would have
the effect of writing off nearly half the
account. It is a suggestive fact that the
method advocated by the Premier is the
very one which, during the consideration
of the Land Bill of 1884, he opposed with
persistent determination and a good deal of
vituperation. This, of course, maybe taken
to show that his knowledge is increasing—
that he is wiser to-day than he was yester-
day. But it may also mean that he takes
expediency rather than principle for his
guide—that, having no firm ground on which
to rest, he is blown about by each gust of
political doctrine, and, as Premier, defends
what, when in Opposition, he condemned.
Sudden conversions are always suspicious
More especially is this the case when the
change in opinion benefits the convert. Let
us examine Sir John's scheme—the scheme
be it remembered, that but a short time ago
he opposed with such ardour. He proposes
to raise half a million of money from the
squatters by allowing them compensation
for improvements, should their leases on
expiring be resumed by the State, or by
compelling the incoming tenant to allow a
similar set-off. For this concession he ex-
pects the pastoral lessees to be grateful to
the extent of half ttxe deficit. In other
words, for the immediate supply of £500,000
he would grant a good many millions 15 @r
20 yeans hence. This method resembles that
of the young prodigal who, to tide over pre-
sent needs, is willing to sacrifice the future.
New South Wales is the prodigal—the les-
sees the Jews. We believe that the squatters
would gladly advance to meet the Premier’s
overtures, and we have no doubt that, when
their leases fell in, it would be found that
most of their long terra of occupancy had
been devoted to improvements which, if not
particularly useful, would betound gratify-
iagly expensive.
» • ■
A person secures a large extent of country
for sheep or cattle farming. He obtains an
indefeasible title for 20 years. To make the
most of his bargain, he is compelled to con-
serve water in tanks and dams, to lay down
superior grasses, put up fences, build
houses and stock-yards, and adopt other
measures for securing the greatest return
for his outlay. He is also obliged to keep
these works in constant repair if he would
make his occupancy pay. All these things
he does with a far greater chance of reward
than the party of miners who club together
to sink an expensive shaft. For every
squatter who is unsuccessful, ten miners go
to the wall. Yet no one has, so far, pro-
posed to compensate miners for the aban-
doned shafts sunk. Anyone with faith and
resources can take up the forsaken claim
and start where the others left off. If dams.
THE HON. W. E. FORSTER.
tanks, or nutritious grasses promise to in-
crease the squatter’s wool return, they will
be constructed or laid down. To allow him
to make one fortune by such works during
his long tenancy, and permit him or his
heirs to make another by forced compensa-
tion at its termination, is surely the height
of unreason. Every day we see men leasing
ground for various terms, and erecting
thereon expensive buildings. They do this
not because they expect compensation when
their tenure expires, but because they ex-
pect to recoup themselves during its cur-
rency. The more Sir John Robertson’s
proposalis examined the more objectionable
it appears. Rather than adopt it, it would
be better to double the period of tenure.
Indeed, it is not much to say that, if it does
not mean securing to the squatters ulti-
mately the fee-simple of their runs, it looks
uncommonly like it.
9 ■ ■
It is to land and property we must look
for the real source of increased revenue—
the only safe ford through the slough in
which carelessness and incompetence have
landed us. It is doubtful whether, in any
country in the world, these great sources
pay anything like their fair share towards
the public expenditure. This is notoriously
the case in England and her dependencies.
It is scarcely a matter for surprise, consider-
ing that in Britain and her possessions the
law-makers have been, even up to the
present, the great holders of land and
property. There is no meaner chapter in
our national history than that telling of
how the British landlords shuffled out of
their liabilities. A little over 200 years ago,
at the time of the Restoration, about one-
half the revenue was derived from land
dues. The legislators—be. the landowners
gradually shifted their burdens on to the
shoulders of the Excise and Customs. They
afterwards engaged to pay into the Ex-
chequer Is. in the pound on the true annual
value of their holdings. How have they
done it ? By reckoning as true annual value
the assessment made in William lll.’s
reign! At the present day they are paying
into the Treasury a little over one million a
year, when —taking the increased value of
land into account —it is estimated they
should yearly be paying forty millions. The
“ Financial Reform Almanac ” reckons that
from 1688 to 1881 they have, by non-pay
ment of laud tax, “ cheated the country out
of the stupendous sum of £1,250,837,734;.”
This scandalous fact will go far to condone
the fierce phillipic of a recent writer:—
“ Of all modern aristocratic frauds this is the
greatest, and if there were a reformer in the
House of Commons worth his salt he would seize
the very first opportunity of bringing the Peers to
their senses by moving that the land-tax be levied
on true annual value. The Peers possess about
one-fifth of the national soil, yielding them nearly
twelve no illions sterling in rent. Of this huge sum
the four-shilling tax would relieve them of two
millions and two-fifths, and as their friends; and
relations hold most of the remainder of the soil,
the forty millions would mostly come out of the
pockets of those who have so long benefited by the
original fraud. Were not the House of Commons
crammed with aristocrats and landowners, such a
palpable swindle would not be endured for a day.”
* * ♦
A good deal of the best land in New South
Wales has passed from the people for ever—
or, at least, until such lime as George's
teaching shall have taken a firm hold on the
community, and the resumption of the soil
becomes the question of the day. Some of
this ground was obtained by means which
will not bear close inspection. But whether
secured by means still considered legitimate
by the bulk of the people, although demon-
strably unfair, or by methods closely allied
to frauds, this land is daily increasing in
value. The increase of population and its
inevitable result—the opening up of fresh
country—are yearly adding to our stock of
drones, to that fortunate class who neither
toil nor spin, but sit idly by and see their
incomes swell as the struggle for existence
becomes keener among their less lucky, or
less astute, fellows. That all this increment
should have so long been allowed to find its
way into the pockets of those who never
earned it, while state financiers were puz-
zling their heads to make both ends meet,
shows how hard it is to induce men to leave
the old ruts of thought and prejudice and
take to the broad highway of common-sense.
It will be seen that we have avoided pressing
Geobgb’s unanswerable thesis—that no in-
dividual has or can have a right to exclu-
sive property in the soil. Granting that
such a claim can be legitimately sustained—
that a community, to the detriment of com-
munities still unborn, has the right to grant
to one of its members a part of the common
heritage of all—the unreasonableness of se-
curing to that member the whole of the in-
crement arising from the labours or the
wants of others, still remains the same. The
absurdity becomes all the more glaring
when it its remembered that many great
colonial landholders live abroad and con-
tribute nothing to the revenue of the
colony which foolishly permits them to in-
dulge in ostentatious luxury at her expense.
If in old countries the soil is naturally
looked to as one of the chief sources of
public income, how much stronger is the
argument in favour of such a source of
revenue in new countries where its value
increases by leaps and bounds—where the
wilderness of to-day is the township of to-
morrow ? Thus, in whatever light we view
it, whether for the purpose of permanent
revenue, or to clear off a temporary deficit,
a land-tax is the most equitable of all.
m * *
The arguments in support of a tax on
property, other than land, are almost as
,conclusive. To these we will revert in
a future issue, meanwhile it is, per-
haps, as well to advert to a curious
proposal made by Mr. Mobris— one of
the compilers of the Mobris-Ranken report
on the public lands—for the purpose of
meeting the present deficit. Mr. Morris
himself admits that his scheme is but tem-
porary and tentative, so that, even if sound,
its application would be of slender practical
value. It is that the Government of New
Soutn Wales issue interconvertible legal-
tender notes to the required extent. When

sums of ££s or multiples of that sum, the
bearer is entitled, not to gold, but to a
Government debenture for the amount,
bearing interest at 4 per cent., and extend-
ing over five, seven, or as many years as the
Parliament may sanction. Gold can only be
demanded on the expiration of the time.
Mr. Mobius naively says:—“ It will be per-
ceived that the notes issued by the Govern-
ment are equal in all respeets-to gold coin,
because they can at any moment be con-
verted into bonds bearing interest payable
quarterly,” &c., &o. In other words, they
are equal to gold because you cannot de-
mand gold for them. Suppose A and Bto
stand to each other in the relation of debtor
and creditor. B pays to A, who is about to
leave the colony, a “legal-tender, intercon-
vertible note ” for the (say) £lOO due. What
is Ato do with it? He does not require a
Government debenture —he wants cash, or
something which will be equivalent to cash
at his journey’s end. He may, of course, pay it
to some third person, but suppose he owes
nothing, and is unwilling to make any pur-
chases before starting ? Or suppose he pur-
chases £5 worth of goods, thinking to obtain
£95 cash change for his £lOO “interconver-
tible,” but receives, instead, the change in
other “interconvertibles?” Or suppose,
as a last resource, he presents his noteat
the Treasury and obtains a Government
bond, he will still have to convert that bond
into gold, probably at a los?. Again, a
Government contractor is paid in new
notes. He passes them to his men. They
have no desire for 1 per cent, bonds, but
have a wish for cash with which to purchase
goods or property in a neighbouring colony
where the note is not a legal tender. How
are they to obtain it without loss? The fact
is, no law could prevent the “interconver-
tibles ” from sinking in value. This would
give an opening for speculators to buy the
notes below par either for the purpose of
converting them into debentures or of pay-
ing them into the Treasury in satisfaction
of Government claims. Thus, the Treasury
would soon have its notes on its hands again,
and be obliged to begin the same vicious
circle. How much simpler it would be for
the Government, in the first place, to issue
bonds bearing a certain interest, and re-
deemable in a certain period, and sell them
in the colony or elsewhere for what they
would fetch? Ingenuity may bo conceded
to Mr. Morris’ scheme, while public
benefit must certainly be denied it.
Time Payment.
A champion of the Establishment iu England ap-
peared recently as an earnest and eloquent advo-
cate of the system of tlme-payment. It was Mr.
Bosworth Smith, who, troubled muoh at the
oroptot of severance between Church and State in
Ecgland, wrote a series of letters to the Times
(subsequently published in a pamphlet), through
which he set forth his reasons why the present
eonnejtlon should not be broken. Wo are here
concerned with but one of these—it is tbe follow-
ing The National Church has been the nursing
mother and the mainstay of hundreds of charit-
able institutions, such as the day school, the night
school, the coal club, the clothing club, the lend-
ing library, the penny savings bank, the allotment
ground, the coffee tavern, the tempt ranee
movement.” The Established Church in England
bas been the nursing mother of all there, and*
therefore, as an established and endowed State
Church, it should be maintained. Would it sur-
prise Mr. Bosworth Smith, would it astound
the cultured editor of the Spectator, by
whom his arguments are accepted and am-
plified, to be told that all these things, by whoever
founded or nursed, are but meagre instalments
of the longest and least satisfactory time-payment
the world has ever seen—not fair Instalments of
coin, paid back for goods received, but miserable
moieties, paltry sops, wretched crumbs flung to
long-suffering creditors, whose debts were their
chief birthright, and whose earliest lessons on
duty were to bo humble and respectful to those
by whom themselves and their ancestors had been
robbed ? Doubtless it would, but as astonishment
Is of no purpose, unless it lead to conviction, we
will endeavour to prove that which we have so
boldly asserted. And first, we may say that these
benefactors, each and all, come under the head of
what, in the nineteenth century, bears the name
of charity—a something as far apart from the
quality which bore the name in the times when
Christian influences were launched, as is the
present Pope of Rome, or Archbishop of Canter-
bury, or President of the W esleyan Conference
from the bonsam-oulotte of Nazareth or the Mar: yr
of Calvary. The coal olub and the clothing club are
charity; the lending library, and the day-school
and night-school are charity; the allotment
ground is charity; each charity, all charity-charity
dribbled out in beggarly instalments for rights long
filched and dues long denied. And what rights?
Let us reckon. Let us begin at the beginning—
the coal club, the clothing club, and the allot-
ment ground—the means whereby fuel and rai-
ment and a place to live are to be painfully and
laboriously acquired, though beyond all the acres
they were freely given by God, and in any genera-
tion have been doubly earned by man.
• ♦ ♦
Why is the coal or the clothing club required ?
The true and plain answer, that should make any
representative or champion of any Church as-
sumed to be based upon eternal justice blush with
shame, is that the hardest, most enduring, faithful
labour of any hind of any British country will net
win him sufficient wages to keep his hearthstone
warm at Christmas, or his wife and babes frun
shivering beneath tattered raiment or thread-bare
blankets, while the patron and minister of “the
Estab.ishment ” are puffed with fat capoa and
bloated with red wine and cloaked with costly
furs by day, and warm beneath eider down by
night. Why are the day and the night school
needed ? Only because the right to education,
though earned, has never been paid, while the
foundations made for higher education have been
stolen. And wherefore the penny savings-
bank, and the coffee tavern, and the temper-
ance movement, but that the thrifty, careful,
self-denying habit may be acquired, whereby the
condition of unrequited servitude is made toler-
able, and the unrest born of wrongs that goad
and sting and pinch and starve is stifled or sub-
dued? And last, and most Important of all, where-
fore the allotment ground; but in most miserably
inadequate part-payment of the debt whose
existence is now dimly understood, and whose
inequity is so vast that the awakening creditor
stands bewildered or bedazzled, he has been io the
thraldom of poverty and the dungeon of oppres-
sion so long,
♦ * *
“Bih,” says the champion of the Establishment;
"Pooh, pooh!” quoth the rector, pursy with his sur-
feit of stolen goods, “ some tale of a reversion cen-
turies old, of Norman usurpation or revolutionary
forfeitures.” But it is not so. Let us seek an in-
stance. Let us get to facts and figures, and shew
how, within a century, indeed within 50, if not 20
years, the goods and chattels, the houses and
holdings have been secured, for which “the Es-
tablishment ” now seeks to inaugurate a very late
and exceedingly long system of time payment.
* * *
A village in a midland county of England, in
area 5000 acres, was leased (there is no might have
been, it is a record of fact which is here set down)
—was leased to 13 farmers at an average rental of
30s. an acre. £7400 a year those 13 farmers paid to
the squire. They could well afford to pay it.
they kept up Jgood substantial homes, each one
with gigs to ride to market, and well bred horses
to follow the hounds; their wives and daughters
wore silks and satins, their sons learned Latin in
the grammar schools of the city, and, save the
eldest, who was bred to follow on In the farm, be-
came lawyers, doctors, or merchants. The rector
at his annual dinner received tithes of the farmers
—a comfortable £l2OO a year—out of which he paid
a curate £lOO annually, that the services of "the
Establishment” might be adequately performed.
And all these good people lived together as com-
fortably and amicably as could be imagined or de
sired. Squire and rector took £B7OO a year, farmers
about £7OOO, and the labourers, there were about
120 labourers—how much for them ? Their weekly
wages averaged under ten shillings. The sum
total paid to them was never more than £3lOO in
the year. £3lOO to be divided amongst 120 men,
with at least 501 women and children dependent
upon them I £3lOO a year to support 020 people.
Yes, it is just £5 each in the year, a little under
two shillings per week for each one—two shillings
per week, that was all, for meat and drink, and
clothing; not all they earned, but all they received.
AVe must try to understand the difference between
their earnings and their wages, we must ask what
would squire and rector and farmer have made of
the land without their labour ? What could they
have made from the land? We will ask the
narrowest, staunchest, straijhtest Tory that
question. We will go a step farther, and ask him if,
without the labour of these 120 men, they could by
any possible means, and under any conceivable cir-
cumstances haveraised the revenues they enjoyed?
We know, and our Tory will not refuse to confess,
that they could not. The sweat from the brow of
labour was as necessary to the cultivation of those
acres as the sunshine and the rain from heaven.
Grant that the squire’s title to the land was good;
respect his property right: Say that the farmer's
skill was necessary as the labourer’s toil, give the
rector his tenth—which, if he were faithful in his
tending of lambs and sheep, ho would earn and
might require—and then is not the labourer en-
titled to his fair share ? Should he not divide with
squire and farmer ? Is he not, was he not, rightly
entitled to the £8460 per annum, the half of the
balance when tithes were paid ? Would God
Almighty ordain him, would common honesty
offer him, a lesser portion? And if squire and
parson and farmer paid him lees, did they not rob
him day by day, week by week, year by year, de-
cade by decade, in the quarter of a century be-
tween ’5O and ’75, of a total of £134,000 ? That is
the amount, as the following calculation will
show:-Total income. £lB,BOO per annum, less
tithes, £lBBO, leaves £16920 to be divided, half of
which would be £8460. Butthe labourers received
only £3lOO, and thus, in 35 year.?, were defrauded
of £134,000.
* * •
That is the sum to be made up by lime payment.
From it some deductions have, of course, to bo
made. Squire and farmer paid State dues and poor
rates, aided in the building of that grim poor-
house in the centre of a dozen such parishes,
where, as neither thrift nor endurance nor toll nor
care nor patience could make any provision for
old age or sickness, the afflicted or broken-down
labourer became the imprisoned pauper, and
thanked God and died; nor ever dreamed that
ease and rest and happiness were any part of
his natural inheritance. The Yvorkhouse was one
Instalment of the time-payment, the donations to
the coal and clotbmg clubs were others. Day
schools and night schools and allotments went also
against the same great debt, and all put together
would barely suffice to keep the interest, paid.
There is no more of equity or adequacy in the sys-
tem of which the Establishment is the nursing
mother than in the terms the Russian proposed to
the Jew, or the Jew would grant to the Russian,
if unrestrained by any salutary fear. It is a sys-
tem of rob and bribe and hypocritio conciliation;
and it is the system which the Establishment
nurses with all tenderness and bestows as a bless-
ing upon Britain. “It would bo fatal,” says Mr.
Boswohth Smith, “if such a Church should be
deprived of State a’d and special sanction in
Britain.” Fatal, yes; little doubt it ivould he
fatal—fatal to the system which rewarded three
score years of honest labour with ten years’ penal
servitude ; which separated husband from wife
and child from mother ruthlessly as any Ken-
tucky dealer in black flesh; which scrupled no
more to rob God Almighty of His tithes than His
poor of their well-earned dues; which was content
with an accomplished butcher of game as a
typical gentleman; which bred a spirit of insular
Chauvinism to be rottenness la tbe bones of the
State in any shock of European war. It would be
very scriou?, if not actually fatal, to all these, but
there is some consolation in the reflection that
none of these are positively essential or of neces-
sity allied to the true greatness of Britain, nor vet
to the glory of God or the elevation of man.
PLAIN ENGLISH.
The Coming Premier, and the Coming
Judge.
The Hon. Dan O’Connor is responsible tor indi-
cating both these men. In a burst of generous con-
fidence he allowed the audience of his “ friends
and admirers,” in the Town Hall on Saturday
night, to infer that heis the future Premier, while*
as to the Chief Justiceship, the Attorney-General,
who is a party by the name of Simpson, “ holds it
in the hollow of his hand,” and is “probably pre-
pared to adorn it at any moment.” These an-
nouncements may both have been the result of
exultant excitement, combined with the care-
less fluency of a too restless tongue, but, as
they are publicly made by a Minister of the Crown,
we are compelled to regard them as arrows from a
bow drawn at a venture on the chance of hitting
the bull's-eye of public approbation. As to the
first promotion—that of Dan to the Premiership
we can only regard it as one of the most foolish
predictions ever uttered. When Mr. O’Connor is
able to climb to the moon on a step-ladder, or for-
get the glories of ancient Greece, and Rome, and
“the silvery eloquence of Daniel Henry
Dbniehy,” he may look for the Premiership, but
certainly not before. This is a contingency upon
which both argument and contempt would be
equally wasted. But the second forecast is much
more serious. As Attorney-General, Mr. Simpson
may possibly hold the Chief Justiceship in the
hollow of his hand. It is no new thing in New
South Wales for a Minister of the Crown to gain
appointment to the Supreme Court Bench, and we
admit the possibility of Mr. Simpson’s promotion.
With all that, we sincerely hope that, if elevated
to the Bench, he himself may not be in the Cabinet
making the appointment. Apart from any ques-
tion of qualification, we would remind Mr. Simp-
son that such self-elevation as that prophesied by
his colleague would be rightly considered as a
political job of the grossest kind, whatever might
be the attainments or the alleged claim of the
perso i to whom the Bench was thus politically de-
graded. The colonies have precedents for such
political jobs which it would be in the highest
degree unwise to follow. We wait for Mr. Simp-
son's disclaimer of his colleague’s unfortunate
eloquence.

A Slandered Guest
It requires immense discretion to assume the role
of a panegyrist. Mr. W. B. Dalley is a florid
speaker, of bright imagination, supported by
copious, although somewhat superficial erudition.
Discretion, however, is not a quality for which
the hon. gentleman is distinguished. By dis-
criminating persons he is regarded in the
light of a cultivate! variety of the Dan
O’Connor species. It was perhaps inevitable that
Mr. Dalley should take the chair at the farewell
banquet to Sir Alexander Stuav.t. And, so far
as the pleasure of the hour was concerned, Mr.
Dallby’s presidency was sufficiently felicltious-
It is not common to reflect deeply amidst the
clink of glasses, and surrounded by kindred
souls, all attuned to a sentiment of good-
will and adulation. But, like the little
book in Revelations, which in the mouth
was sweet as honey, but in the belly was bitter
as gall, Mr. Dallby’s encomium on the guest of
the evening leaves an unpleasant after-taste. Mr.
Dalley described the victim of his unfortunate
laudation as a man without passion—a nun of
monotonous and indiscriminating amiability.
Now, a man who has no enemies cannot be a
worthy, man so long as the world contains
scamps. A man whose indignation never finds
expression cannot be a large-souled man, so long
as instances of rascality and meanness meet one
on every hand. Mr. Dalley described Sir Alex-
ander Stuart as a feeble creature who would
not have so far forgot himself as to make unplea-
sant remarks to “ scribes and pharisees, hypo-
crites,” and who would have been careful to
maintain the most amicable relations with
the money-changers in the Temple. We trust-
nay we believe-that the shameful description is
neither true of Sir Alexander Estuart nor de-
served by him. The slander must recoil upon the
head of the man who uttered it. Mr. Dalley has
altogether failed to appreciate the manly features
of Sir Alex. Stuarts character. Drawing upon
his own imagination for the portrait of an
ideal hero, and intending unconscientiously
to paste that ideal upon the object of his eulogium
whether it fitted or not, Mr Dalley blundered.
He described the model man of his own concep-
tion. The portrait was that of a pitiful creature
insensible to the contrast between virtue and vice
—alike supple and insinuating to a noble man and
to a brazen scoundrel—one of those conscienceless
and self-seeking vermin who declare that " God
is good and the Devil is not so bad.” This was the
portrait Mr. Dalley evolved from his inner con-
sciousness. But it is emphatically not a likeness
of Alexander Stuart.
Press—Suppress.
In one portion of the oration made by the Hon,
Dan O'Connor, the New South Wales Postmaster-
Geneml, on Saturday night last, he accused the
Sydney Morning Herald of glaring partiality
in reporting speeches in Parliament. We are not
concerned with the question of taste involved in
the attack. It is the charge itself which we now
consider. Mr. O’Connor distinctly accused the
Herald of suppressing matter in the speech of
a member which was opposed to the views of that
journal, and of distorting what was printed in
such a way as to hold the speaker up to public
ridicule and contempt. More than this, he in-
stanced two cases in which this had been done in
the reports of his own speeches. In bringing for-
ward this indictment Mr. O’Connor seemed only to
voice a matter of public notoriety, for the hearty
cheers which greeted the speaker appeared to indi
cate that his audience was with him. The charge
is the most serious that can be brought against a
dally newspaper, touch an organ, by the mere
fact of chronicling public occurrences, tacitly en-
gages to publish a true and impartial account of
matters of general interest. If, as Mr. O’Connor
alleges, the Herald has prostituted its functions
for the gratification of its own ends, it la mors
culnabie by a thousandfold than the scorers In an
latercolool &i cricket match would be li they wil-
fully falsified the record of the runs in order that
the side which they favoured miKht seem to win.
With Its honesty of motive thus impugned, the
evident course for the paper to adopt would be to
print the accusation and then refute it. In place
of doing- so, the He bald gives strong colour to
the indictment by suppressing the very charge itself,
although made by a Minister of the Crown, and'
for that reason alone, a matter of public interest.
We cannot say what the motives were which in-
duoed this latter act of suppression, but to most
people it will be evident that if the Herald
wished to admit the charge, no better way than
this could have been devised.
“ Subjects, in their homage to their Sovereign,
show their veneration for the naction of which he
or she is the symbol.” This is the Echo’s apology
for lickspittle loyalty. If it means anything, the
sense of it is that subjects when they cringe to a
monarch show their veneration for—themselves.
Hence cringing is a manifestation of self-respect!
We always thought the Herald-Echo crowd had
a lot of self-respect, and we admire their power of
putting things neatly. But, on the other hand, no
people in the world show such homage to the
Sovereign as those of Dahomey. They’d better
And hence the “veneration” they have for the"
nation of which that monarch is the symbol.

The duties of a bank manager very rarely serve
to gain renown for the individual beyond the
narrow area within which his signature and
presence are familiar. Occasionally, however a
banker achieves something either in the way’ of
cash-lifting or burglar-smashing, which makes his
name a familiar sound throughout the colonies
Mr. J. N. Hill, manager ot the Hoddie-street
branch of the Commercial Bank of Victoria, h«s
chosen the latter means of winning fame. He
has only been in the bank service for about 13
months, having spent some years previously in
me service ot the Department of Education in
Victoria. Although he was for so long a time
occupied in ** teaching the young idea how to
shoot.” he does not seem to have educated him-
self in the same art, for his revolver practice
with the burglars was as bad as his conduct
was brave. Be is now only 34 years of age, and
viewing his handsome, resolute features as pour-
traye*l on anm her page, we feel it our duty to
sympathise with many thousands of unappropri-
ated blessings—tor he is married.

Attempt on the Life of the Prince of Wales.
ALL THE HARROWING DETAILS.
1. The landlord of the Pig and Cat remarks casually to a customer that he couldn’t quite make out that chap wet cleared larst week without payin’ his score. He were
always a-talking about takin’ lives, and he wanted to know when the Prince of Wales was a-comin’ down. 2. The customer mentions to his master that there were a feller at
the Pig and Cat larst week a-talkin’ about takin’ the Prince of Wales’ life. 3. The master just mentions to his friend, Jones, of the STANDARD, that dangerous characters are
hanging round, and that the Prince’s life won’t be safe if he comes down. 4. Next day the newsboys are yelling “ STANDARD— Important Assassination of the Prince of
Wales.” 5. H.R.H. is not alarmed for himself. It is his bleeding country he is concerned about. 6. Still, if some devoted and loyal person could be found, say by the offer of
half-a-sovereign—being his exact equivalent— 7. To make up exactly like H.R.H. and go in the State saloon car, it might save great suffering—to the country. 8, So, when
the station-master at Chester rushed to receive H.R.H., and expressed his loyal surprise that the Prince should travel unattended under the circumstances, the half-sovereign
party replied grandly that the shield he relied on was the haffections of is countrymen. 9. At the same time a mysterious personage, closely muffled, was alighting, surrounded
by troops, at a wayside station, just before you come to Chester. 10. How inexorable is late! That night H.R.H, was awakened from slumber by a desperado clambering
through the window, and announcing, in hollow tones, that he had come to take H.R.H.’s life! 11. And what if he did turn out to be an energetic life-insurance agent? It is
only first-class misdem. [?] like our personal chum, Valentine Baker, who can be allowed to receivs visitors and alleviate the rigoura of a dungeon with cutlets and

The frantically loyal Coukieb of Brisbane
warned colonists of the consequences likely to
ensue if they sat at table with the genial Doctor
O'Doherty, M.P., although he has been a member
of the Queensland Legislature and a respected
citizen lor many years. The Speaker, generally
known as the “Groom of the Stol-V’ thought it
might prejudice his chance of knighthood if he
presided, but Sir Charles Lllley, who refused a title
once, but was afterwards prevailed upon to accept
It, did not hesitate to take the chair at the banquet.
Our old friend—everybody’s old friend
—George Ceppin, has had a sad loss in the death
of his eldest daughter, Constance Ada Lucy- It
was only a year ago that she was married to Mr.
Anderson, eldest son of the late Hon. K. S. An-
derson, and one of the Victorian official assignees.
Mrs. Andeison bad with her husband been on a

King Alfonso of Spain is said to have been
a very “larky” youth, and childishly fond of
silly practical jokes. On one occasion, when one
of his Ministers came for an audience on State
affairs, the monarch pulled a soogee bag over tde
head of his devoted counsellor, and kept it there
till the royal mirth evanesced. Such little tricks
were not the worst tniugs against him. E fuelled
in a convent of the strictest order, he took to sow-
ing his wild oats as soon as he was released,, and
Queen Christina must have been many times
tempted to “ bury her fingers in the painted

say, their Initialling nas much the effect upon

Kesources of New South Wales,” and, as we read,
“exhibiting specimens of his artistic skill at the
Society of Painters in oil colours. His daughter’s
efforts are also in the same artistic line. Mr.
Coombes, at the conclusion of his lecture, intro-
duces a “crushing battery in full working trim,

“Superfluous lags the veteran on the
stage” was hinted openly enough to old Dean and
Archdeacon Macartney, of Melbourne, who has,
officially, “outlived his span.” In that respect he
seemed desirous of emulating the limpet-like
example of the English Vice-Chancellor Bacon,
who, over 80 years of age and deaf as a post, yet
clings to the bench as if his living depended on his
earning his salary. The hints of the Bishop were
as disregarded as the “leaders” of the Press, but
a change has come about, and the Dean has at last
resigned. He probably feared that Bishop Mnor-
house’s successor would be one who would stand
no nonsense, hut have an Archdeacon who
could vigorously “perform archdiaconal duties,”
which, in Sydney Smith’s words, D what an arch-
deacon has to do, and which cannot be expected of
a man over 80 in years.
Dr. Guthrie Carr was a notability in the
Australian colonies as long back as ’57. He was
then doing good biz. at St George's Hall, Mel-
bourne, in the then popular show of electro-
biology. He had an old Maori “subject,” called
“ Happyman,” who, for so much a night, did what-
ever the “ doctor” schooled him to do. For along
time Guthrie Cirr has been on the list of ‘ missing

Printers have lost lately the head of their
oldest Melbourne house. It was but five years or so
ago that Mr. Moore, of Ferguson and Moore, died,
leaving his share of the business to his son. Young
Moore has now died at the early age of 37, and while
Mayor of South Melbourne. His father married
again when nearly 70, and left his line new man-
sion in Albert Park, with a goodly fortune, to the
young wife, who is still bis widow. The present of
a stepmother did not much please the son, nor did
it mollify him that so much was left to her- O.d
men will do such things, as witness Sir Charhs
Gavan Duffy, who took to himself a third wile
when of old Moore’s age. Sir Charles gave up the
Speakership of the Victorian Assembly to go home
on such matrimonial venture, in which, by the
way, he has been as successful as old Lesseps in
the way of adding a young family to the Euro-
pean population.
Prince Milan of Servia, who was accused
of cowardice even before the recent war. is said
to have had a suit of armour made specially for
this last campaign. Next the body it la of the
softest silk. Over this is a thick, tightly-com-
pressed layer of eiderdown, upon which again is
a layer of wadding: the outer surface is of the
toughest leather. This armour reaches from the
neck to the knees, and covers the arms as far as
the elbows. This would be a pleasant suit for a
campaign in the Arctic circle, but in any other
part of the world a John Lucas would be trans-
formed into a nursery stakes jockey by a day s
wear. During the war Prince Milan did not put
his armour to the test much. Like England s
princes, he took care to be in the vicinity of the
bread-waggons when fighting was going on. Ho
usually protected the roar—except when the army
was in retreat, then he lt d the van by some miles

Colonel French, the commandant of
volunteers at Brisbane, is too independent a Radi-
cal to win much favour from the Bananaland
aristocracy. At a public meeting, worked up by the
nobility of Gregory Terraco, tc protest against the
use of the reserve facing their mansions for a rllie
range, the Colonel dared to oppose the proceed-
ings, but was not allowed to speak. The Chief Jus-
tice thought that Col. French, as a paid servant of
the public, was not entitled to interfere with mat-
ters affecting' the civilians; wrid when the Colonel
remarked that the Caief J u BOice was also a .paid
servant of the public,” the upper section of the
community and the Con secvative Press were
dreadfully Indignant at st mil a sacreligioua and
seditious expression of opii it»n. As theC.J.was
not sitting enthroned in tin i awful majesty of the
Supreme Court, he could i iat very well commit
the Colonel for contempt, o r the Democratic com-
mandant might now be la nguishing in confine-

Few people, if any, recjall the libel action
brought by George Angus tus Bala against Hain
Friswell, a brother liUeratet ir. Friswell pubhstmd
a book called “ Modern Men of Letters, in 1870. la
this work he dealt very sai icastioally, if not sar-
donically, with Sala, who to ok it with a bad grace.
Sala was called, among othe r names, * a driveller
of tipsy, high-fiown nonsem le,” “ One who will sell
his pen to describe a Jew cl othier s stock, or that
of an advertising furnitui e. dealer or hatter,’
“ One who had written for I Joyd, the cheap pub-
lisher,” such stories as “Ads, the Betrayed, or the
Murder of the Old Smithy,” “The Hangmans
Daughter,” and “Love and'. Madness.” Friswell
had overshot the mark in ai .-tributing the books,
whose titles we have quoted,, to Bala’s pen. and the
latter came off triumphant! y on that point with
£5OO damages. By that large amount it will be
seen how injurious the autb orship of such books
was thought to be to a man’s character. On the
other libellous matter no ve rdlct was arrived at.
News comes of an old t beatifical favourite,
Jennie Winston, who was popular in Australia

hit in Dib din’s “Waterman,,” singing the Bay of
Biscay song as never woman wan heard to sing it
before on this side of the due, and was the original

husband, Mr. Arthur Bell (one of whose legs was
a remarkable feature, introductory to “ The Con-
spirators’ Chorus”), to America. Ten years is a long
time for partners to pull together, ana Bell and
his wife got apathetic. In feminine language,
they “wanted a change.” Sae maintains her place

In the following, from a London exchange, there is a hint for a few industrious old
men in Sydney:—“ A walking whisky shop has been run to earth in a prohibition dis-
trict in Ontario. The polles could not discover why an old man with a wouden leg
should have such attractions for the whisky-drinkers. until one day they saw him sit-
ting on a tombstone, and watched him [?] his wouden leg and take out a black
bottle. The cavity in the leg is now filled with glue.” a good trade might be done
on the tombstones in the Devonshire cemetry on Sunday afternoons, during this hot
weather, The police here are more reasonable than those of Ontaric. A sup now and
again would keep them from stopping up the cavity with glue.
much to do with tho chorus, one of whom greatly
influenced him. Divorces are easily obtained la
America, and there is no “Queen’s proctor ” to in-
terfere on tne score of “ collusion.” There was
collusion in this case. The divorce took place one
day; Mr. Bell and Miss Cirmin were married on
the next day. and all three—Miss Winston (now
rightly so called once more) and the newly-married
Bells appeared in one piec? same evening.
“ Rose—Song.—January 15, at St. John’s

Mr. James Mirams, M.L.A., is a consistent
Radical, and a consistent teetotaler. Some time ago
the irrepressible and garrulous little man was very
bad from erysipelas, and his medical adviser in-
sisted that he should drink plenty of port wine.
The diminutive senator refused to carry out the
doctor’s orders for nearly a week, and then the
medico told him distinctly that ho must either
swallow the tawny port or die. But Mirams
didn’t want to die; he had fought a plucky up-
hill battle through life; he had forced his way to
the front in politics, and he felt that he was to be
the saviour of hia country, and that when Graham
Berry was got out of the way, his mantle would
fallen himself. Now that Berry is going out of
the way, “Little” Mirams feels that his time has
come, and that be is to be the future Liberal
Premier of Victoria. If the Jlittle man should
reach the highest pinnacle of his ambition, and
the Southern colony should ha ve the benefit of
Mirams regime, it is to be hoped that both he and
the country will thank that ’oottle of medicine
called port wine. But we are a fraid that Mirams
won’t be Premier, He still d< mounces wine and
beer, and his teetotal fads will purely bar the way
to the Premiership. When wil t ne discard them
and again take to good port win e ?
The Daily News, started as an evening
paper in opposition to the Me lbourne Hebald,
had but a short life. Mr. Nathan Levi, its prop-le-
tor, is now seeking to resuscitate it bv a limited
liability company. It takes years to get a daily
paper up to paying point—a rule well proved by
the few exceptions to it. Poor Morin Humphreys
has lately died a starved out victim to his endea-
vour to start a Melbourne paper. When he sold
out of the Caps Mounted Rifles he came to Mel-
bourne with the £l3OO he had realised by that sale.
He was foolish enough to put it all Into the ven-
ture of the Magpie, a weekly effusion ot the
comic kind. That was In the days when no penal-
ties existed for killing; magpies, and this one did
not live long. Humphreys then tried the stage,
and made as poor an actor as he had been
editor. He then aspired to a renortor’s work,
but at that showed no talent. He joined another
man in starting the “ Victorian Men of the
Time,” tho “men” being asked for ss. for a show
in its pages with liberty to write their own notices
of themselves. Even that wa s not found to pay,
and never ran to a second edition. Humphreys
lias left no family, and his wife died some years
back worn out with struggling in that battle of
life in which he has now gone under also.
Tho details of Vanderbilt's death are a
fearful lesson to money-grubbers. He was forty
millions sterling strong. He had twenty millions
left to nim by hia fath-r, old Commodore Vander-
bilt. and this the son doubled in eight years and a
half. He had a stroke of paralysis three years ago
which should have been more of a caution to him
than it was. He was debatin g with an opposition
speculator some one of the many railway difficul-
ties which he had to meet—and overcome. The
hour’s discussion of the question taxed his over-
laden brain too much, and h« i fell forward a dead
man into the arms of his m onetary antagonist.
Tho paralytic stroke of three years back had led
him to the building of a tomb of Bastern-world-
Itke splendour, which was finished ,lust in time to
receive its tenant. The bulk of his enormous
fortune-supposed to be the largest in the world -
will, it is believed, go to his son Cornelius, the
eldest ot his seven cnildren, and now a man of
middle age. The others will be fobbed off with
a million sterling or so each, and will have to
struggle on with that, poor pittance—if they don’t
go to law to lose it in their efforts to get more.
Vanderbilt took a shilling luncn daily and paid for
it weekly—taking care to deduct from the bill lor
any day in which he failed to take his shillings-
worth.
He was a newly-appointed N.Z. District
Judge, and the morning after his arrival at the
countrv town where he was to administer the law
he strolled down to the court-house to see what
kind of crib it was. and to have a quiet smoko.
The new Judge was not much to looa at, and his
old hat and black pipe didn’t add a mite to bis
dignity- When he reached the court-house the
J.P. (who puts the yokels through at five “ bob ” a
“tear ”> was there before him, and as soon as he
clapped eyes on the Judge, he yelled out, “Coom
alang. coom alang, sweep this plaice out quick.
The Joodge’il be down soon to see what kind of a
coort-house we’ve got for ’un. Smart's the word.”
The Judge was rather staggered at the order, but
soon recovered his self-possession, and seized the
broom and set to. Seeing him at work, the J.P.
went home to breakfast, and did not visit the
court-house again till the new Judge was on the
bench with his wig on. Strange to say. the sight
of the wig in contact with the features of nls
Honor was the first thing that startled the J.P. It
made the features all too familiar, and when he
saw a smile of recognition ripping up the judicial
face the poor man felt that he had made an ass ot
himself, and he went out quietly and looked about
him for a decent place to hang himself In. The
Judge, however, found him out in the evening,
and cured him with whiskey.
One of the most popular of Melbourne
Mayors was John Thomas Smith, or, as he was
affectionately called by his friends, “ Jacky
Tommy.” His widow has lately presented a bust
of him to the Melbourne Corporation. He was a
most genial man, though not perhaps so ostenta-
tiously genial as Mr. Gatehouse, another Mayor of
the marvellous city. There were no airs or c-raceo
about “Jacky Tommy.” He travelled second
class in the train—not from penuriousness, but
from choice—and smoked a short clay pipe. Hr
was Minister of Mines too, at one time, and used to
grieve to the soul the elegant officials of that
Department by going about the office on hot davu
In his shirt-sleeves. Yet, though he was thus care,
less of the rules of etiquette, which are more than
the Ten Commandments to most other men
from Ministers of the Crown to shop-walkers’
he was very graciously received by the
Queen when he went home to present
Her Majesty with an addreis from her
loyal city of Melbourne. It 1s probable, however
that he had his coat on when he went to Court and*
left his pipe with the sentry at the gate with a
guileless request to keep it alight for him till he
came out. It is said he brought the first donkey to
Australia, but we regard this statement as m ythi.

there was as little humbug as is possible in a
Mayor and a politician. We hope he is making an
equal mark in his present sphere of action.
The persecutors of poor Pall Mall
Gazette Stead have contrived to give an appear
ance of genuineness to their policy by working U n
a big subscription for the Armstrong family. The
renowned •‘Lily” will be provided with a good
education and a modest dowry when she comes of
age. It was certainly a good day for ” Lily ” and
a bad day for Stead, when the latter rescued her
from the tender care of her delectable mamma
However, the sentimental sympathy which ig
being lavished on the “ poor little thing ” is partlv
understandable and wholly harmless. But what
sickens us is to read that, previous to Lily’s ad-
mission to the “ Princess Louise’s Home,” her
mother and father made a tour of inspection, and
“ expressed themselves as satisfied with the ar
rangements made.” Here we have Armstrongpere
and mere artfully paraded as pattern parents and
severe critics of sanitary “ arrangements.” c an
the public swallow such stuff when, in spite of a n
her bolstering up by the Government, Mrs. Arm
strong had to admit that the family slept in one
room, that she had been "pulled” two or three
times for drunkenness and foul language, and that
her husband gave her “one in the eye” for dig-
posing of the daughter she now snivels over. But
there, a certain section find it convenient to
glorify these Armstrongs, so a new house has been
furnished for them and the paternal sweep has
been presented with two new sets of machines
“ capable of reaching the tops of the highest chim-
neys built.” Perhaps Mr. Stead will find him a
job now that the iniquitous Armstrong sentence
has expired.
William Waterhouse Collins, the new
Sydney secularist lecturer, made bis bow as a lec-
turer to Sydney folks, at the Gaiety social, on Sun-
day morning, but he merely took a preliminary
canter up the straight. In the evening, at the
Gaiety, he again appeared, and this time went the
whole course to the admiration of a large audi-
ence. Again were hundreds turned away from
the doors; what is the Christian Evidence Society
doing? Our fat friends, to whom a little loss of
flesh is nothing, ought to attend these lectures- it
is easier than the Banting system. They have
simply to sit stillland ooze and mop. John Lucas
ought really to go, but in the Interests of his fel-
low hearers, he’d require to place each foot in a
tub. The lecturer’s subject was—“ Can Man know
God.” In character, the lecture was somewhat too
rudimentary for a c-ydney audience, who have, of
late years, had some strong truths told to them.
They will take their “Collins” as hot as he
can give it to them. In justice to Mr. Collins, we
may state that on announcing his subject, he in-
timated his intention of going to the root of his
opinions in order to place himself in a clear (light
and on a fair footing at the commencement of his
Sydney career. The lecturer is, as Mr. Symes
described him, “ a little man of good ability.” He
is a good speaker, and we should imagine, a still
better debater—a bright, cheery little fellow with
a kind'y smileand winning way, somewhat youth-
ful in appearance—just the sort of man to attract
the ladies,now Charles Bright has grown somewhat
grey and worn in the wars. We believe Mr.
Collins has a lengthy engagement in Sydney. We
are confident he has a great career before him.
Thus a correspondent:—“An article that
appeared In the Dublin Freeman's Journal,
some time back, referred to Mr. Winter, a Mel-
bource journalist, as being ‘gifted,’ana I see in
your occasional reference to the ‘ gifted ’ Winter,
that you are evidently under the impression that
the individual in question is Samuel Vincent
Winter, the editor of the Melbourne Herald, I
may tell you that the Winter whom the Irish
journal credits with being ‘gifted’ is notthesmart
S. V. Winter, but his brother, Joseph, who runs
the Catholic organ in Melbourne called the A two-
cate. AYhy the Dublin Freeman should term Joe
Winter • gifted ’ I am at a loss to know, as no 'me
has ever known him display any marked ability,
except of the sort possessed by men who have al-
ways a keen eye to No. 1. I think the home
paper heaps this encomium on Joe’s head
because he was identified with the Irish
National Land League in Melbourne, but it
can hardly be aware of the fact that when
that organisation was first started in the Southern
colony Joseph Winter held aloof from it and tried
to throw cold water on It, but when it was begin-
ning to develope Into a strong body he joined it
and obtained a good few advertisements for his
weekly print. I was astonished when I saw Win-
ter's name mentioned in the same category with
many illustrious and good Irishmen who have
made their mark in Australian politics, as his news-
paper-the Advocate-is, like the Sydney Free-
man s Journal, an out-and-out Conservative
paper that supports a policy which, if it once takes
root iu these colonies, will produce the same effects
as have been produced in old Ireland by bad
government and class legislation.
“Ruined by Betting and Women” was
the heading in a Melbourne evening paper when
William Yuille committed suicide tbe other day.
The rash gentleman in question was “ruined” at
the early age of 21. Woman’s infidelity and a
long run of losers so preyed upon his mind that he
took to highway robbery in the winter of his dis-
content. Poor fellow 1 He thrived no better at
the last game chan at backing “ doubles ” or love-
making. So he killed himself in sheer disgust. A

William Yuille, AYilliam Yuille,
You were—pardon us—a fool!
Quite a lot of manly qualities you lacked;
You precious soon knocked under.
We should startle you, by thunder’

By some fair inamorata—
Then for tne silent tomb have felt inclined,’
And longed to slumber in it—

But on see md thoughts we always changed
our mind.
Yes, William, girls and horses
Bring their sorrows and remorses,
More especially to boys of 21;
They've been, in fact, our curses.
But we took to writing verses,
And didn’t quite collapse as you have done.

it may Be remembered that at tbe recent
rvficknell shlvoo our champion skiter, rushing in
where an angel would tear to tread, dubbed the
unfortunate guest, “ the prince of operators,” and
Thai this absurd remark was greeted with perfect
Shrieks of laughter. Now, in justice to tbe in-
anifed Cracknell. let us explain where the laugh
came in. There Is a very wide difference between
l oanable electrician, wnich Mr. Cracknell is, and
a capable operator, which he certainly is not. To
he an electrician requires a brainful man, and one
who is willing to devote years of study to the
science. On the other hand any barber’s clerk,
nrm iding he has an ear for time, and can fairly
read and write, can be an efficient operator in 13
months. We have some men who are both elec-
tricians and operators as well, however, but such
men are rare, and the encouragement they receive
Is a sufficient warning to others to Seep their
ikrhts under the thickest bushel they can find.
So far as operating goes there Is only one
Superintendent in Australia —Superintendent
M'Gauran, of Western Australia, who can
lav claim to the title. At the same time,
it is no more neceisary lor a Superintendent
to he able to manipulate a “ key ” than it ia for a
ship's captain to be able to swab a deck. There is
a good and true story told of a raw clerk who one
dav attempted to receive a message which Mr.
Cracknell essayed to send. Time alter time did
the novice tell his Superintendent to “repeat,”
until at last the latter, losiug patience, snapped
back, “Send some one to instrument who can
read ” To which the now savage colt, not know-
ing who was at the other end of the wire, replied:
“ bend some one that can read! Why, I’ve shown
your tinpot stuff to every soul in the office, and not
one can read a word. N. says you must be one of
the Double Bay blackfellows, and H. thinks you’re
the cove that used to copy old Bhalmanazar’s
wash hills out on the Babylonian bricks.” Of
course there was Sheol to pay over this at first,
but the Superintendent, who is known as a good
sort, was content with an apology when he cooled
down. The above explains why the yells or
laughter greeted the “ Jaynil’s” remark, and shows
how a sterling man can be made the laugning
stock of all by the fulsome slush which an ig-
norant friend may chose to heap upon him.
iu the University Hall the other night
theiGwesa concert of classical music. Of it a
high-Mass metropolitan paper says:—“ The hearty
and appreciative applause accorded each number
of the programme amply proves that when the
highest class of music is interpreted, revealing the
inner lights and hidden depths of the composers’
minds, it is as well received and thoioughly en-
joyed as the more stirring melodies of ‘ Pop goes
the Weasel,’ or ‘ Annie Lisle.’ ” We’ve attended
pjaesieal concerts In Syoney, and, It a number of
faces resembling boar’s while; digesting, were a
p*oof of an insight into the “inner lights and
hidden depths ot the composers’ minds,” we can
only say that, if the composers themselves were
present, they’d go straight home, assaulting in-
offensive people on the road, borrow a plane,and re-
duce their pianos to shavings. Tne tact is, there
is more nonsense spoken and written about music
ffian about either ot its sisters, poetry and paint-
ing—wnich is saying a great deal. Only by those
who hgve devoted years of hard labour to the
3tudy of music can the works ot the great masters
Se really appreciated and enjoyed. To the retired
squatter, whose devotion has been to land-grab-
bing, or to toe pert Miss who is working her way
through the “ Como quadrilles ” and the “Malden’s
prayer,” the elaborate compositons of Beethoven
or Weber are xnere unmeaning alternations of
jingle and rumble. No one wants to blame them
for this. It is when they or their journalistic ad-
mjrers habole about "the inner lignts and hidden
depths,” that we see moderately sober men falling
hapfc on drink and tobacco to keep themselves
from worse.

for thoao who were young and good-looting—was

The Times says that “An independent
Irish Parliament means secession sooner or later.”
We quite concede this, if it can be shown that on
any Irish question for the last 50 years tbe Times
was not wrong. Did an independent Pennsyl-
vanian Parliament mean secession ? No; It helped
to put It down.
It is currently reported that the difficul-
ties which operated to prevent Sir Alexander
Stuart from proceeding to England some years
ago, after accepting the N.S.W. Agent-General-
ship, to assume the duties of the position, are
again incommoding him in a modified form. In
this, as in other countries, it seems sometimes as
though Solomon s proverb works back-end fore-
most, and riches are better than a good name.
When nearly 20 years ago it was proposed
to expel a member of the Victorian Legislature
for taking a bribe, the Hon. George Higinbotham
rose and declared that the senator who gave the
bribe should also be excelled, as it was not fair to
make fish of one and llesh of another. Well, the
House expelled tbe receiver but left the giver
severely alone. Since then Mr. Higinbotham has
been appointed a Supreme C mrt J edge, and only
the other day the briber whom he wanted expelled
from the Assembly in days gone by was elevated
to a seat on the Bench alongside him. We wonder
if reminiscences of olden times will ever appear to
the two functionaries when perched on the judi-
cial pedestal together.
The trustees under the will of the late
Sir G. Wlgram Allen, are said to find them-
selves under the legal necessity of seeking to
realise on some £8001) or £OOOO worth of the pro-
missory notes ot a politician, found among tbe
deceased knight’s papers. Captious people say
it was always a tacitly understood thing between
the parties that the ad vancesshould be regarded as
cancelled by the Speakership and the knighthood,
and that the maker of the notes had been allowed
to believe that they had been long ago destroyed.
But this plea Is too impotent In law as a defence
against an action on the bills, and would amount,
in any case, to a confession of corruption and
malfeasance in office. The difficulty is this—the
trustees would be personally responsible to the
heirs were they to neglect any means to recover
the moneys. The debtor can’t pay ; and the
political situation is seriously complicated by the
fact that, with these liabilities hanging over his
head, one of our most potent political chiefs Is
practically paralysed.
The chief promoter of paste-aud-scissors
journalism in England, Mr. G.Newnes, who started
and made a fortune out of Tit Bits, is now one of
the members of the House ot Commons. Perhaps
the strongest incident of the English general
election was the overthrow of Sir Watkin Wil-
liams Wynn. He and his ancestors, tne uncrowned
kings of AValee, have sat for Bast Denbighshire
lor 177 years, but in this contest not only has
W. W. W. been defeated, but his life has been en-
dangered as well. During one of his election
meetiogs, brick bats were carelessly passed to him
tbrougn the window, and at the close of his speech
he escaped by a back door and had to run like a
redshank for a couple of miles pursued by a yell-
ing crowd. Favoured by the darkness, he escaped
with hut slight injury.
Queensland will have to pass a law making
the members of her Legislative Assembly, to
whom she recently voted payment for their
services, knock the money down in the Par-
liamentary refreshment-room or in some other
time-honoured fashion. To spend it in the cause
of demonstrative virtue is manifestly irregular.
Messrs. Lunfiey Hill, Kates, and Morehead no
sooner pocketed the £2OO each than they looked
about to play the Good Samaritan. They gave it
to the Hospita'sin their electorates. Now, Queens-
land hospitals have their donations supplemented
by a3to I rate by the Government. Hence, the
country which has paid each of these men £3OO,
must follow on with. £4OO a-piece more immedi-
ately. Some men would be less of a national
nuisance drunk than charitable.
Why Mr. Alfred Deakin has been selected
as leader of the so-called Liberal contingent
seems a perfect enigma, unless it was in order to
placate the man-David Syme, of theAoE—who
was the cause of his political being, and who
seems to have his hand in the making of every
Yletoiian Ministry. It is only a lew years since
tbe great David Syme introduced young Deakin
to public life, and he certainly has not since de-
veloped abilities which prove even hia fitness for
a Minister, let alone a chief. How old stagers and
skilful politicians like W. Collard Smith, James
Mirams, J. B. Patterson, John Woods, W. M. K.
Vale, and C. E. Jones can bring themselves to
follow and acknowledge the leadership of the
juvenile Deakin, is a problem that can only be
solved in the developments of the future.

for the taxation of absentees, who go hence to live

may leave here. If they go to Great Britain they
are threatened in this way, just now, to be burnt

wants to get at them there, and if they be got at
here also they will be situated in the interesting

Mr. Harold Stephens told the Cooma people
the other night that he had had personal dealings,
and been mixed up with Sir Henry somewhat, and
that he knew Sir Henry was personally an ob-
noxious person to anybody with whom he came
into contact One would like to hear Parkes in
one of his biting bitter humours describe Harold,
“ with whom he has been mixed up somewhat.
But the Parliamentary blossom goes on to say
that ho asked Sir Henry, in consequence of Var-
ney Parkes making an ass of himself at Liver-
pod, if he intended to support Sir John Robert-
son, and fold him he wanted a categorical answer,
when Sir Henry informed him that he would sup-
port Sir John. We don’t like contemplating the
time when we shall be an old man like Sir Henry.
But it flashes before us that, whenever such time
comes, if a lineal piece of humanity, with a head
on it like Harold Stephen’s, pops up and demands
a categoric I answer about an important political
matter we have not chosen to publicly divulge—
though we may burst the waistband of our
trousers, we’ll seize, eat, and swallow the Monaro
outcome of manhood suffrage.
Of the Federal Council now sitting in
Hobart, the Pall, Maul Gazette speaks thus:—>
“An Australian federation comprising Victoria,
Queensland, Tasmania, South Australia, and West
Australia, but leaving out New South Wales and
New Zealand, is something like a federation of
the United Kingdom minus Ireland and the middle
ot England.” But with South Australia out, and
due allowance made for the sort of Constitution
West Australia “enjoys,” the title assumed by the
gentlemen sitting in Hobart is still more hollow,
'•'he Gazette goes on to say that a sham federa-
tion will not u. erely do no good, but may do a great
deal of harm.
Some of the veterans of Victorian politics
have been asked to stand at the forthcoming elec-
tions, but they appear to have had enough of it.
They have, in American phraseology, “seen the
elephant,” and are glad to get clear of the crowd.
Loader will not stand again for his old constituency
of West Melbourne. Simon Fraser will once more
contest that seat. His £lOOO portrait, painted by
Millais, is a big thing in the Melbourne Picture
Gallery. It shows what aay yet be done by the
portrait painter in comparison with the photo-
grapher, and comes well out of the contest. Sir
George Yerdon has a sad drawoacfc to his success-
ful life—he is a martyr to gout. To animal food
he is quite a stranger, and has been so for years.
It is questionable if the next Parliament will see
Sir Charles Macmahon in it. Like Sir Francis
Murphy—his precursor as Speaker—he prefers
“the ha’cyon calm ot days” which old age, hap-
pily for some, brings with it. They have seen the
show, and are content to be well through Vanity
Pair, With Buiwer they say
“The weary bird, blown o’er the deep,
Would sooner quit its shore
Than they would risk the toils again
Which Time hath brought them o’er.”
Mr. Jas. Miraras, the diminutive and
teetotal member of the Victorian Parliament, has
published his address to the electors of Colllng-
wood, whom he has represented tor over 10 years.
Amidst so many conflicting claimants lor the
leadership of the Liberal party, and so many in-
trigues for obtaining that position, “Little”
Mirams declines to pin his faith to any man, or
swear fealty to any leader, and he puts forward a
thoroughly Radical and progressive programme.
It is said that Chief-Secretary Berry, and other
recreant Liberals, will move Heaven and earth in
order to defeat Mr, Mirams for the able and effec-
tive manner in which he has exposed their
duplicity and trickery, but we think the
“great unwashed” of Collingwood will rally
round the little man once more. We don’t
like some of his views, but he Is, un-
doubtedly, one of the most consistent poli-
ticians and uncompromising Democrats in the
Southern colony, and he has done a vast amount
of good for the cause of Protection and Radical-
ism. He was the only Victorian public man that
wrote to the Melbourne Press exposing the hol-
lowness of the Soudan campaign fiasco, and more
recently he courted unpopularity by moving in
the Legislature for a return showing the cost to
the colony ot the maintenance of Sir H. B. Loch
and Government House. This motion was opposed
by that notorious tuft-hunter and bigot, the Hon.
J. B Patterson, who “ wouldn’t stand by and see
his Excellency the Governor so insulted,” For
this move Mr. Mirams will have to encounter the
opposition of the loyalists and Jingoes, but we
think he will survive it. At any rate, we wouldn’t
like to see him out of the House, where he has
proved so useful on many occasions. Besides,
there are not so many honest men in Parliament
now-a-days that we can afford to lose one of them.
The Saturday Review compares Austra-
lia favourably with Britain’s “elder but much tesa
sympathetic child, America.” It is strange how
little sympathy some people have for you, no
matter what you do for them. Let us see. Over a
century ago the English King and his humane
Ministers turned loose on the American people all
the cut throats that could be lound In the United
Kingdom: all the hirelings that could be nur-
chased from Gorman princelings. Every human
rubbish-heap in Europe was scoured for garbage
to bring the Yankees to reason. Muskets were
placed in the hands of released felons, bayonets
given to the frequenters of brothels, in order that
colonists might be taught to respect the divine
right ot monarebs. Thirty years afterwards, for
insolently refusing to allow British war-ships
to search American merchantmen and “press”
as many as were required for service under
the Union Jack, some of the veteran Pen-
insular regiments were sent across the Atlantic,
descended on a village, ravished all the women,
marched on Washington, and blew up the Capitol
—the English general in command mildly remark-
ing, “I will make cow-pastures of these Yankee
places,” and then bolting precipitately with his
lorces back to his ships. For 60 years subse-
quently, English writers exhausted the vocabulary
ot abuse and scon in describing American cus-
toms, manners, and institutions. That ot avery—
•in heirloom from Bagl sh colonial times- came in
for deserved animadversion. But when the
Republicans at last determined to sweep away the
cursed Institution, there was scarcely a British
writer who did not uphold the “ chivalry ” of the
men who were endeavouring to perpetuate it.
Ships were let loose from English dock-yards to
destroy Northern commerce. War in favour of
the sLaveUolders was more than once on the point
of being declared. And after all these attentions,
to tbink that “ America is a much less sympathetic
child than Australia!” Alas, for man’s ingrati-
tude.”
We are rapidly attaining the old world
civilisation. It is only at very rare intervals that
we can chronicle the gracious condescension of
royalty in our miast; but, thank goodness! we
have our vice-royalty always with us—like the
poor. And every now and then we can work up
some nan sealing little anecdotes of purely home
manulacture. From a Melbourne paper we
gather thai Sir Henry Loch has met with “strange
adventures ” at Mount Macedon. First of all, His
Excellency had an “ encounter with a snake, in
which the enemy of mankind had to succumb.’
As the representative of a mischievous pollti
cal system is, in hs official position, quite as
much the “ enemy of mankind” as any snake, we
thought for the moment that Victoria must be
governorless. But welwere disillusioned by the dis-
covery that Sir Henry has, since the snake episode,
had an adventure —such a droll affair I—
with a butcher boy. Sir Henry got off
the track one day, “and had to accept a
lift home in the spring-cart of a butcher boy, who,
all unwitting of his companion, entertained him
with all the local gossip, finally defying him to a
match at snowballing in the winter.” There is
the true European flavour about “ all unwitting-
of his companion.” We are expected to see some-
thing exquisite humorous in the idea of a butcher
boy maintaining his ordinary demeanour in the
oomnany of a Governor. Pheughl But let ua
finish this thrilling yarn. “The astonishment of
the youth on discovering the identity of his fel-
low-traveller was only equalled by his delight at
the substantial acknowledgment of his services.”
That bit, too, is quite up to the orthodox form of
all “ amusing stories ” about great people. Tbo
butcher boy was astonished probaoly. There has
been so ranch glorification of the Governor in the
Mount Macedon, and every other district, that tbo
boy had pictured him with a halo round his hat.
Anyway, it is nice to read a h out the “ substan-
tial acknowledgment.” Sir Henry can afford to
pay for a ride once in a way. Most of his travel*
ling expenses are charged to tbe Government of
Victoria. Even the pecuniary acknowledgment
was indirectly provided by the butcher boy’s fel-
low-colonists.

Dhen for a space we made our painful way

"Vossed now and then with slippery skeletons

a little cry. a hand that clutches air,
1 home without a rider; on the ground
The beauteous rider lus, and on her face
There sits a tranquil smile ot settled peace.
Alaal the soul that wrought that smile has fled.
Gently we bore her to the house, and what
Physicians could an vise or kindn.ss do
Was done, but all in vaio. Who can recall
Tue spirit to that house from whence its flight
Has once been taken ? j f(wet
The days that followed. How c mid I remain
To drag through tedious and weary hours
When every varied scene for miles around
Reminded me of Linda ? 8o I left
The town, the district, everything that served
To tell me of my sorrow, and I seek.
In unknown lands and in a changed life,
To east off the emirchog bands ot grief.
And still my anguish with excitement drawn
From the prospector’s luck-adoring lif o.
But it is all in vain I change the scene,
Mvsslf I cannot change. Why..therefore stay
To flght with fortune, seeking for that pr.ze
Which e’en when won, would be to me no more
Than the bright trinket to a savage man i
Why should I spenc my days in searching for
The glittering guerdon which I covet not ?
Wherefore live a slave unto my sorrows
When I have power to lift the grievous load
That presses on another s weary back,
And give to some the joy ot peacetul rest
To me mja.ll unknown I will so.
And strive, by mlFist’ring to others; griefs,
To cure mine own. Thus, thus I will respect
Mv darling’s memory, tor all her thought
Was but to glad, or profit, all who came
Within her hallowed j
To clothe my thoughts in selflsQuess so long I
Fool to have thought that I could prove my love
To Linda by such deeds as she would hate I
Henceforth I live but for my fellow-men !
And when the grave shall hold my mortal part
T pray to prove—not worthy—but belo\el
Of her with whom on earth my spirit dwelt.

CORRESPONDENCE
I Correspondent* who give

mwnicatiom noticed.)
“ Arena ” ; What you write about scenes
of ruffianism and blackguardism in tbe h. M.

such an unvarnished description ot your-
self What is your drunken aunt to us I
We never heard of her before "Fanny
Bird ” • Have used one of your para
“ rmintrv Yokel ”: You say that the electors of
South Melbourne should reject Mr. David Gaun-
son M.L.A , at the approacning election, because
years ago besought to get Ned Kelly reprieved.
We hone tne South Melbourne voters will not
allow that to weigh with them. Dave Gaunson,
being in favour of the abolition of capital punish-
ment. had an undoubted right to agitate
for the reprieve of Ned Kelly, and every
other public man has the same 1, Ft;...
“P.A.” (Bundaberg, Q.): Good parody. May use.
“Junius You s*y you wrote it with a pur-
pose, We could have sworn it was not wntten
with a pen. Call round some day and tell the
office-boy’s aunt what it is all about “.Hiram
Abiff ’ : Will touch up tor future issue.... -lack-
ass’’ (Melbourne): You only want a brass door-plate
?o be an assurance company. And you need not
go far for the brass either. Your screed has
helped to boil cabbage for tlm office boy s mother.
Rnt t.rv again. To a boy of 1/, with colossal
cheek, y all thinks are possible. Loon, for instance,
at Heaton ...“ W. Sykes” (of Bernma): Well. Bill,
we can scarcely read your screed. You are wrong,
onvhow. in addressing it to Mr. Traill, late ot
Darlinghurst.” It wasn’t Mr. Traill who had the
honour ot imprisonment for the Clontarf expose.
Mr. Traill wrote the article, but the law, wiihits
customary accuracy of operation, seized upon Mr.
Archibald and another and locked them up....
“C. Green”: Will probably utilise.... Wilens-
piegel” (Kavenswood, QJ: Know nothing about

ceived pars., but could not make any use ot them.
“ Reader You are certainly writer than the
author you quote “G. (Rockhampton,
O ): You should choose a subject better suited to
vour lyric powers. Say an ode to a dead wood-
bug “ H.K” (Dubbo): You grumble because
the local Telegraph makes one unpleasant and
witless allusion to a necessary conveyance, and
seem to think that such a solecism is remarkable
in colonial journalism. You don t know that in
Sydney there is a paper called the News which re-
vels in such things, and gives up much of its space
to such unsavoury items. Seems p isltively to re-
vel in them....“ Sport (Queensland): You can
obtain the Queensberry rules by writing to H H.
Cansdell. Foley’s Gymnasium, Sydney, and
the Sheffield Handicap rules irom Frank Smith,
Burrangong H0te1.... “G. : Your letter received.
Have not been able to interview the gentleman
named and get a sight of the original letter he
received. A weak par., veiling the identity of the
party, would do.no good. A strong one would be
libellous unless every fact could bedemonstrated.
Next week, therefore.... “B.A.’: We have com-
pared the press copy of your letter with the
printed version in the Daily Telegraph. Un-
doubtedly the Telegraph has been careful to
omit your strongest points. But wa could not
point the moral without printing the original
and the mutilated version of the Telegraph
in parallel columns, which would occupy too
much of ur space “ T.W. : Thanks— M.
Robertson”: Three banquets, a crieset match,
and a public holiday have afforded sufficient
ioy for one week. We keep your screed for our
enlightenment—of the gas probably, next week.
“ H. S. Invalid ": We really can do nothing to
help you, although wo fully believe that the rail-
way fettler is now wearing little Johnny s pants
for a Sunday necktie, and that his best girl revels
in the possession of your bonnet with the long
white feather. Four only chance is to go down
with a bull dog and interview the railway officials.
As to Johnny, if he is really in want of them-lt is
not a usual thing, but still we dont mind it tor
oace-we have an old pair or two that might——or
we would even lend you our bull d0g,... b.N. :

“ Yebudah Ben Monsha ’ : Next week. We notice
that one line is, ”How shall a guy know, he lies
drunk in a gutter.” Is it an auto-biography ?
“Romance of the Lancer ”: Won t do. There is
no romance about them, except the statement In
the evening papers stall eg that they "are a use-
ful body of men.” Try something else, your verse
is good. .. .*• Yulcan ” (A) bury): Not this time..
“ A Working Man ” (Sydney): Pamphlets received,
with many thanks. Givens a call; we may have
some we can hand you.
A sound resemblance—’Enniker and Any-
cur.
M. de Lesseps was thrown from his horse
lately. He fell on his head. Tao horse was much
frightened hy the nois? of the concussion.
Observant people say that Sir John
Robertson has much softened of late. They say
mso that this may be credited equally to his head
and to his heart.
At the banquet to Dan. O’Connor the sub-
stitution of paa-nuts for almonds in the dessert
was not the outcome of an overstrained economy,
but a desire to foster native industry.
The Soudan medals, which will adorn the
manly chests of our noble 700, in commemoration
of their glorious campaign in tho East, will be
distributed on the 13th prox. As the decoration
ceremony has been so long delayed, it might now
be postnoned to April I—a fitting day on which to
finally deal with our fighting foolishness.
King Alfonso of Spain is said to have left
a fortune of over two millions sterling. 'J his, it is
said, was chiefly acquired by the sale of titles, a
traffic indulged in by the King to an enormous
extent. Tne husband of a wealthy laundress was
one of his new nooility, and paid £300,000 for the
title of a Grand Duke with ancestors for about six
centuries thrown in. Why did not Sir Salmon
Wilson, Henniker Heaton, Honorable-withln-the-
eolony Lloyd, John Davies, and C. J. Roberts go
to Spain ? We should have liked them to go to
Spain—or Jericho.
In the race for grovel some of the Mel-
bourne papers are running us pretty close. The
Herald having exhausted its vocabulary of
honeyed phrases over the Lochs, is bursting out
into little leaders on Lord Carington. “As an
arbitrator in a strike, he would be invaluable,
sniffles the Herald. And then—“ His little speech
to toe immigrants <>n board the his wel-
coming words to the first, arrivals from the old
country since he assumed tne Government, was
& master piece" It this sort of thing continues, let
us have reciprocity. Let the Noose find out some
of Sir Henry Loch’s masterpieces, and tell us
what he would be invaluable at. Ann. by the way,
there’s an opportunity just now for Lord Caring-
ton to develope his special gift. He can arbitrate
between the bookmakers and the totalisator.
Mr. W. F. Forster, M.P., P.R.S.
The Right Hon. W. E. Forster, whose portrait
appears on the front page of this issue, has lately
retired, to a large extent, from the range of public
observation. His chief exploits are contained in
the history of that period from 1889 to 1883, when,
as Chief Secretary lor Ireland, he earned the un-
compromising hatred of the Nationalists. Using
the powers of the Coercion Bill to their fullest ex-
tent, he ciused the gaols to be filled with
‘•suspects,” including Mr. Parnell and other pro-
minent leaders of the aspirants for independence.
hjs harshness in dealing with the malcontents,
and his unwillingness to release the imprisoned
Vf.sP., induced a split in the Cabinet,
and resulted in his resignation. It was
during the period of his administration
of Irish affairs that he gained the soubriquet of
“ Buckshot Forster,” in eonsequence ot his order-
ing the constabulary to use those pellet* Instead of
bullets when firing on the populace. Why It was
necessary to fire at all was a question without an
answer at the time. As might have been sus-
pected from his apparent callousness to human
sutferinpr, ho is the son ot Quaker parents, his
father having died while on an ami-slavery mis-
sion in America, and he himself was educated at a
Ouaker school near London ■ His first Parliamen-
tary candidature was in 1859, when he unsuccess-
fully contested Leeds, tout two years alter wards
he won a seat for Bradford, a constituency which
he has represented in every subsequent Parlia-
ment. His wife, whom he married in 1800, is a
daughter of the celebrated Dr. Arnold, head
master of Rugby school, England.
There is something dare-devilish and
Dumasesque about the burglary at the Bris-
bane gaol, which proves to us the robber was
an aristocrat of his class, and one who, if he had
looked after himself properly, might now be an
eminent Government contractor.
The “principal” of a school near Sydney
has decided to draw the line at the children of
puDlleans and admit only those who are by birth
and position entitled to rank with the colonial
aristocracy. This decision is amusing, for the very
promulgator of this decree would not have beeu
able to gain admission under such a rule a few
years ago. It is an unwise relative that remem-
bers its own antecedents.
Sir Henry Loch has left Government
House, Melbourne, and gone to Mount Macedon.
He giv°s as his reason his dread of being roasted
in tne Yiee-regal head-quarters by some of the
vagrants who camp in the Domain, or being
smotnered by the evil smells which enter his bed-
room window from the rippling Yarra. The real
reason is that Loch was growing too popular.
Colonial Governors, please note. A lot of.popu-
larity is worse than a lot in Purgatory.
Certain parties advertising in a Mel-
bourne paper for a dog answering to the name
of “ Tossie” hold out this alluring inducement to
the discoverer:—“ Finder rewarded with current
coin of the realm, and a vision of an angel without
wings in the shape of the original ‘ Tossie.’ ” Our
Melbourne correspondent says that the nog
strayed into his yard, and, having noticed the ad-
vertisement, he took it home and saw “ Tossie.”
He says the sight nearly paralysed him. She was
red-headed and cross-eyed, and when he arrived
at the house was busily engaged in belabouring
her little brother with a 'room-handle. He didn t
wait for the “ current coin of tne realm.”


An extended lease of life may be obtained
by the continuous use of Wolfe s Schnapps.
Avoid imitations.
Messrs. Bray and Lichtner, of Sydney,
have just issued the first number of the Austra-
ttan Photographic Journal, a neat octave,
which should prove of service to amateur pho-
tographers throughout the colonies. Since the
introauction of the dry-plate method ot pho-
to(rraphy, the artjhas become a favourite divers ion
with both sexes, and such a periodical should re-
ceive ample support.*
Wolfe’s Schnapps beneficially affects the
con titution and reforms the morbid habits of the
bo"iy.

speaking parts in the play makes all-round com-

French, either. To those days, evidently, it was
the custom for French sovereigns to send
daughttrsto an English “Seminary for Loung
Ladies,” in order to study tneir native language.
Such an accent as bonnie Kate spoke with is no-
where else acquirable. Apart from this trifling
eccentricity in dealing with the mother-tongue,
these fair maidens were delightful.

In England it seems that at some of the
theatres the management continue to sell tickets
for the stalls and pit when there are actually no
vacant scats in those select localities. We lust
stop to observe that such a thing never could
happen here.” In Sydney, if you buy a paste-
board. you always know that you will be certain
of having something to sit on—whether you will
find a place to put it is another question. But we
started this par. for a distinct purpose. We In-
tended to say that a man in London, who thus paid
entrance to the stalls and then was unable to get a
seat, brought an action against the management,
but failed to obtain a verdict, as the Judge ruled
that the sale of the ticket only guarantees admis-
sion, and that, as the plaintiff was allowed to enter,
the contract was fulfilled. This decision coincides
with an answer we gave to a correspondent a
month ago, which, we would modestly add, proves
that ihe Judge’s ruling was correct.
Thus a correspondent on the lost-in-the-
bush circle-sailing theoryln connection with
vour correspondent’s (Cobar) mention of men
wandering in a circle when bushed being
right-handed, you state that you doubt this be. ng
the real reason, and ask if horses are right-handed
too. I fancy your correspondent is quite right in
his theory, and may add “ftiat horses are undoubt-
edly right and left-handed (or rather legged), just
men are. I fancy anyone who has ridden much
on horseback must have found out the difficulty
of making your horse where there is no track on a
plain, keep a bee lino. He is to certain to bore off
one side or the other, and this in cases whore no
homing instinct or desire influences him. This
defect is especially perceptible in horses re-
quired for cuti ingout work at times when they are
required to turn very suddenly. I hey nearly all
wheel round much more speedily on one side than
the other. I once owned a horse who teemed
unable, or at least unwilling, to turn to the left at
speed at all, and w lien a bullookmade a bulek turn
in that direction, he was sure to floor the stran-
ger’ by making a complete turn round himself
from the right to get after the beast. I have been
to’d that some of the Nsrth American horse
Indians capture wild horses on loot by profiting
bv the circle in which these animals continually
run-they themselves running always across the
segment alone. They thus gradually tire the
brutes down. The question is a curious one, and
might be more important to horse racing people,
for instance, than they thick for. As tar as my
pvnprience goes, most hoists always make fastest
time ar® handed course. This fact makes
me doubt one detail in your correspondent s
theory. I fancy that a bushed man (inght-lmnded)
is more likely to wander to the right than the left.
I wi l not enter further Into details as to my
reasons for the btlief, but I should be glad to hear
the experience of other bushmen on the subject.
However, I am perfectly persuaded that all
animals from men to tortoises, will, nngulded,
walk in’ a circle from the muscles on one side ot
the oodv being stronger than the other. Even one
side of the human or animal face is never exactly
the same as the other.-.! as. Atkinson.”


PEPPER AND SALT.
Only a few weeks ago we sang the praises
of a parson who boldly announced his acceptance
of a new liVing because the stipend was larger
than what h'e wab getting at the last pla'ce. He
was a labourer in no particular vineyard, but just
Worked where the best wages were obtainable. The
promoted cleric had the satisfaction of remember-
ing that he never made any rash promises to his
old Hock. As a conscientious gentleman, he had
felt that there was no knowing what the future
might bring forth, and so he carefully assured
himself against emergencies. It positively vexes
us to observe that the Bishop of Melbourne has
exhibited none of the caution which distinguished
his humbler brother professional. Only as recently
as last September the Bishop told the Church
Assembly that: “Perhaps there were two or three
years of work left in him. If there were, and if
he felt that he could do it satisfactorily to himself,
they could be quite sure that he should not leave
them, AYhenhe went it would not be to take up
any other duty in the Church.” Later on in his
oration, the Bishop reiterated these protestations.
Now, why is it that lights of the Church are almost
always too ready to proclaim themselves indiffer-
ent to worldly advancement? Let a colonel be
ever so attached to his regiment, no one expects
him to swear that he couldn’t think of accepting
a higher command. The most gallant of warriors
wouldn’t dream of committing himself to such a
statement. If he did he would probably keep his
word and stand by his colours, presuming a better
berth offered itself. A soldier of the Lord, how-
ever, is not troubled by mundane scruples, so it is
not surprising to learn that Bishop Moorhouse
jumped at the offer of the see of Manchester with
Christian alacrity. By why did he make that un-
fortunate promise ? Wo must be just. AVe sang
a little laudatory hymn to the obscure Presby-
terian parson, so we must also burst into song
bout the Bishop. But in a sadder key—
A WORLDLY WARNING.
Oh, Bishop! we fear
In September last year
You were hardly sincere
AVhen you spoke
Of staying out here
Till your business career
Was ended—oh, dear I
What a joke 1 *
At that moment you
Had nothing in view
(No increase in “ screw ”
Let us say).
Alas! though, how few
To snug Billet dour
(That d Vanglais construe)
Gan say Nay.
Ah, good Bishop benign,
That statement of thine
IVas all Yery fine,
But this is
A jolly good line,
"Which you couldn’t decline;
! You’re right to resign—
It’s good bis.
Tfals moral is plain,

Yrom adopting a strain
Like you did;
; Yor the future refrain

Which outsiders must fain
Pronounce “ kid.”

A red-hot Salvationist was testifying lately

German was amongst the audience. When the

thusly to a few friends: “Veil, dot vas tarn goot

A soldier of the Harmy, known in his sinful
days as “Dick the Devil,” was buried in the Mel-

she remarked with a pious humour, not unworthy
of Pope Gregory of non Angli sect angeli renown
in his best days, “Don’t say Dick the Devil! He
is Dick the Angel now.” It is a touching faith
that believes a sinner may be transformed into a
saint by turning a mental somersault. He de-
serves an epitaph. And he shall have it, though
we lose two hands at poker to do it. Here then

Of one whose life is spanned.

In that bright and shining Sphere—

And the unholy row.
They called him Dick the Devil;
He is Dick the Angel now—

Blackall (Q.) people evidently know how

Hydraulic Engineer Henderson and Geologist
Jack had been sent out bv the Queensland Govern-

the Government men’s water supply was ex-

to pawn their souls for a drink. Mayor James and
Alderman Haylock wore wide awake though, and
came sailing down on the thirsty ones with a
bottle of whisky, and a full water-bag. Now, an

that kind of drink undiluted :

Magisterial humour is a common thing in

posing on the kerb, the night previous. “ How old

A writer for a small Melbourne paper, the
weekly issue of which is eagerly looked forward
to by suburban goats, states, with a naiveU which
would be pathetic if it were not ludicrous, that he
once went to call upon Bishop Moorhouse, who
was “ engaged at the time.” Strange, this ? The
persevering scribe was not to be put off with any
such flimsy excuse, however, so, brushing the
haughty menials aside, he bored his way in until
ho was confronted by Mrs. Moorhouse. Let him
tell the rest in his own cheerfully candid fashion.
Says lie:—“lf you had seen the adroit manner in
which Mrs. Moorhouse barred my way, and par-
ried all attempts to beard the lion in his den ? I
can assure you I had a dreadful difficulty in foil-
ing her. The scene put me in mind of the central
situation In ‘Forget-Me-Not,’ the duel between

and AY. 11. VernoE as Sir Horace Welby.” Thunder I

His similarity to Vernon as Sir Horace Welby
struck him all at once with the force of inspira-
tion. The idea is alike complimentary to his own
unassuming-worth, and gracefully condescending
to Vernon. We wonder what it put the Bishop's
wife in mind of ? But we suppose she was too
scared by this spiritu—[al.—Bn. B ]—apparition to
be put in mind of anything beyond for a
policeman. The reference to the adroit manner
in which she barred his way and parried his
attempts has evidently more in it than meets the
eye. She probably barred his way with a table,
and parried his attempts with a poker. But he
foiled her—with dreadful difficulty. This says
much for the nerves of Mrs. Moorhouse. What
the Bishop did when he was bearded in his den—
to repeat the elegant metaphor—the apparition
does not say. There are some things that pass
beyond the limits of utterance. The Bishop, we
may mention, wears thick-soled boots with square

Dr. Caffyn, of Melbourne, made, a short
time ago, the startling statement that men rightly
counselled by science “could, in a few genera-
tions, produce first a perfectly healthy man. and
then as a sequence any form of genius he might
require.” Let us first put this Into the form of a
table. First, we will presume that the healthy
man has been produced. Here then;—
First Perfectly Healthy Man wishes his son to be
an orator.
S’.P.H. Man marries into the family of Dan.
O’Connor. Result (if any): An orator.
Second P.H. Man wishes his son to be a poet.
S. Man marries a daughter of the House of
Slalen. Results (if any): A bard.
Third P.H. Man wishes his son to be a statesman.
T. Man becomes allied by wedlock to the noble
family of Dibbs. Result (if any): A statesman.
Fourth P.H. Man wishes his son to give pleasure
to all—trace hig descent back to two centuries
before the Creation, and be returned to the Im.
perial Parliament,—marries a princess of the
Koyal family of Bennett. Result: A son who
gives pleasure to all, &c.
That is clear enough. Now, suppose a union of
all these gifts in one perlon is required. This is
the method
Orator marries sister of bard. Result (if any); a
poet-orator.
Statesman marries sister of man who gives plea-
sure to all, &c. Result: A statesman who gives
pleasure to all, &c.
Poet-orator marries sister of statesman who gives
pleasure to all, &c., or vice versa. Result: A
poet-orator-statesman, who gives pleasure to
all, &o.
Two or three more mixtures would produce an
encyclopedic genius or-a jackass. Probably a
jackass. It is an ingenious idea for all that.

Bown in one of the colonies—any of them
will do—the thing has happened before, and,
judging from the quality of some of the present
resident d ispensers of law, is likely to occur again—
a lovely woman stooped to folly, and finding, con-
siderably too late, that even salaried magistrates
can betray, she lodged a summons with the clerk of
his own court calling upon her seducer to explain
to the Bench—himself—his reasons for refusing to
pay her certain sums weekly for a job of nursing
she had on hand. But the “ beak ” was not to be
had that way. He coolly took the plaint from the
clerk and lit his pipe with it, so she went to
another court and related her trouble there. As
the matter now stands, one “ beak ” will have to
appear as defendant before other “ beaks,” and
just as N.S.W. Judges can stand by a “brother
Judge,” these magistrates will most probably be
able to discover a legal way out of the difficulty
Ye gods I and these be our Judges. Bobbie Burns’
never calculated on the actuality of such men, or
else he would never have fired off such a series of
conundrums as—
“ Is there in human form that bears a heart
A wretch, a villain, lost to love and truth,
That can, with studied, sly, ensnaring art.
Betray sweet Jenny s unsuspecting youth ?
Curse on the perjured arts! Dissembling smooth;
Are honour, virtue, conscience all exiled ?
Is there no pity, no relenting ruth
Points to the parents fondling o’er the child,
Then paints the ruined maid and their distrac-
tion wild.”
Now, Mr. Magistrate, just sit up and tell us how
you feel.

where he was. The Spirit of God took hold of
him, and very soon he was crying for mercy. As
he stood up, perfectly sober, with bis face all
aglow, and in great earnestness he said: ‘ Look
here, friends, I was never saved like this before.

We italicise the last line which comes with the

about that. Ask any old wall-poilsher in George-
street how many Salvation hymns it would take to
put him straight, and how many times Sister Santa
would have to set ’em up before he came to. He
would say the operation of the Army tonic was
something more than wonderful—it was miracu-
lous. Why can’t these people give us an occa-
sional dash off truth. It would be a novelty—in a
religious organ. Observe, also, that he had never
been saved like this before. Evidently he had
been saved other ways, and the salvation had not
been the sort that staids washing—in whisky.
Bet you, this penitent will need saving a few
times more yet.

Mrs. Fenwick Miller, an English female
statician, a sort of woman Hayter, has recently
discovered that in England there are at . present
948,000 more women than men, and that the
feminine commodity is in greater supply than the
malearticle—in fact, that the progeny of woman
is more woman than man of late years. Woman
has also developed a tendency to live, tfy four
years, longer than her species in the previous
generation, while man only exhibits an inclination
to cling to the silver cord while twice the world
circles the sun, in this generation, over and above
his ancestors’ average age. It is a natural suppo-
sition, in the face of these figures, that the male
animal, like the moa, will shorty be no more..

us now ?
When the men are all gone, you will do ?
Of our species the soonest was man,
In the first human race Adam ran,
When the Lord made him Eve (she was made to'
deceive).
And the trials of life then began.
From they twain sprung the people of earth
(Though of man at this time there’s a dearth);
At the start we were equal, your tale is the seque !
To the first sad fratricidal birth.
Dear Miller, let’s tell what you’ll do.
As of men there are rather too few,
For fear the race die out, we’ll warble your cry
out.

“Cat Pool” was the name of a highly in-
tellectual amusement with which some telegraphic
officials used to while away the heavy hours in a
certain town out West, and the way the game was
played was this; Bach player provided himself
with an old Wellington boot, down the leg of
which he thrust a healthy oat. Wires were then
connected with the positive and negative poles of
a powerful electrical machine, and these wires
were then poked down the boots till they touched
the oats, which at once began to recieve a succes-
slon of shocks compared with which the soundest
kick of the Soudan donkey would feel like the
tickling of a peacock’s feather. Jumping at once
to the conclusion that the boot-holders were not
actuated by any friendly feelings towards them,
the cats would set determinedly to work
to scratch holes in the toes of the boots,
and leave that inhospitable district at the
rate of 15 miles a minute, and the owner
of the cat who first scratched itself loose won
the game and scooped the pool, which was
generally played for—“ a bob in, and the winner
shouts.” From an exchange we learn that some
inventive cusses at Blackwater (Q ) Improved on
this, however, and managed to get more fun out
of a harmless-looking piebald oat during the
Christmas week than they could out of a dog-and-

water Juggins, and tell him there was a oat up
there that could scratch pull any man across a
dam. Of course Juggins at once replied, “ Oh,
that be blowed for a yarn,” and then a match was
made, the conditions being that the man was to
stand at one side of the dam with his hack
towards the water, a rope to be tied to hi*

fastened to the cat, which was kept in a bag.
No sooner was the signal given than the oat
was let loose, and half-a-dozen spectators
suddenly jerking the rope, the man, who of
course couldn’t see what was going on, at once
found himself floundering in nine feet of water,
and before he could possibly recover or reverse,
he was landed on the other side of the dam to
the intense amusement of the spectators and the
cat, the latter tugging still at the rope like a
young bull; and a few minutes later a well-
soaked, able-bodied citizen was seen chasing a cat
round the town, and pelting it with junks of
road-metal and profanity at every stride. You
can’t guess what sport can be got out of a cat

special column of the Brisbane Courier: Gen-

garden, every comfort, and no loagers. Highest
reference here at disposal; full particulars and
terms in confidence (if asked) to ‘ Conservative

keepers will please not apply. That culchawed
offleah’s son should come South at once. We have
families here, holding satisfactory social positions,
who would, in addition to other comforts, treat
him to a rose-water bath, and put his hair in
papers every night before he went to bed, and
wake him in the morning with sweet concerts of
angelic strains, and burn incense before him, as a
bevy of lovely, lithe-limbed Circassian slaves bore
him down in their snowy arms to breakfast. Faint
lilies on toasted asphodel leaves, and perfumed
water would be served at every meal; but, of
course, if he preferred (and some officer’s sons do
at times) he could have cow-heel and tripe
washed down with a gallon of colonial beer.
There's another reason why he should come
South without delay. There is a lodging-house
law in force in Brisbane, and even though he was
the only boarder, the beastly lospectah fellah
could placard the apartment sacred to the officer’s
son with a vulgah notice to the effect that it was
»licensed to lodge one person only.” We have no
such barbarous laws down here, dear Duke, so come
South instanter. But hold. We must first know

trave the following amusing account of some ot
fhe results of living among Christians which he

Hebridean islands, among islanders who had re-
turned from Australia. Said the merry prelate.
“ One man came robing up to me, drunk, having
imoibed freely ot kava. That man said. Bishop,

learnt from white oeople. Another man came up
and stayed a long time. He witnessed the Christ-

Sow?' Ha (Dr. Sfiwyn) could not understand
what he meant, but at last he found out that that
islander had lived lor three years at Maryborough.
He spent his holiday at Carlitmas at the Mary*
borough races. All he knew of the birth and in-
carnation of our Cord and Saviour Jesus Christ was
such as to cause him to neaeve that that and the
Maryborough races were the same thing. That
“as all he had learnt during a residence of three
veara among white people ” Blattering to the
cultured Caucasian, isn’t it ? Bat those niggers
were better observers than many a Bishop who

The news from Milparinka is serious. The
Sullen River is coming down a “ hanker,’ five
miles wide. An advance guard of rats is preced-
ing it. The front skirmishers of this army have
already reached Milparinka, and sat down to con-
sider the situation. Rats, even £ b ?n not backed
up by a flood, are bad enough. Bat, to know mat
they have formed an alliance with five miles of
water is grave. Taat’s why we say the news is
serious.
Great and deserved credit is given by the
daily Press to the late Mr. Randwica. “ who vir-

surely, a word might he said in favour of these

humbly carrying out the Divine ordinance, filled
the Asylum there with dear little childien, and
gave the State the privilege of supporting them.
Our grief for the loss of Mr. Rmdwlok should not

“What has occurred in Tonga,” senten-

Sale was once one of the proudest towns
of Victoria. When its oldest inhabitant was a
young man it had hopes of rivalling the splendour
of the metropolis. Thomas Burke was dragged in
by the ears into the po ice court there a few days
ago, and charged with using improper language m
a public place, to wit, the central street in bale.
I The prisoner admitted using the language, but
paralysed the Bench by delivering a long argu-
ment in proof of Sale’s not being a public place at
all. The local paper describes him as a low-look-
ing, vulgar, vicious ruffian.”
Another injustice to Ireland. At the
Rockhampton Court, tno other d»y, the name of
Pat Ryan was drawn from the jury ballot-box,
and although Pat was in court at the time, ana
madly anxious to sit on the ease, tne Bench re-
fused to allow him to do so. The only explanation
offered for this strange conduct is that Mr. Ryan
had, on the previous day, “ tuk a friend under th
lug wld a brick,” and as he happened to be
prisoner as well as juror, the magistrates thought
that, being a conscientious man, it would be un-
fair to ask him to sit in judgment on himself.

The Echo complains of a place on the
Glenmore Road, where, “ amongst other decaying
tilth, is thrown bedding both from human habita-
tions and stables. Here.it is not an uncommon
tnio'g to see a cow, salamander-like, chewing one
end of a long wisp of straw dragged out of an old
mattress, while the other end is on fire. The
peculiar properties of the milk such food can
make are not pleasant to think of.” What would
he have—tne cow to start at the hot end ? To our
mind the animal’s conduct is a typical case of in-
herited instinct from some progenitor who com-
menced at the blazing extremity of a former wisp.
The Echo man is dainty. He wants his milk

A Sydney gentleman went out one night
last week on the loose. He got tight, and plofted
up a chance acquaintance in one of the Hotels,
They spent quite a jolly evening; they also spent
a few pounds. The new acquaintance of the busi-
ness man was not short of cash, and spent it rißht
royally. Towards midnight they started for home,
the gentleman insisting on his new found friend
staying the night with him. Arrived at the door,
he discovered the latch-key was gone. “ There s
a go,” he remarked; ‘ I Haven’t got my (hie) key.
“ Never mind,” reolied his friend, “ i’vo got my
esntrebit and jimmy here; you keep a look-out

Among the New Guinea curios was a
ghastly array of skulls. The people around specu-

the former possessors came by their ends. One
cranium, however, had a j iggea hole in the top in

the absence of information on this subject, there
may be something in the remark of the alien

There was a great Temperance picnic in
Melbourne the other day. One of the local papers,

observed to be drunk.” Hutnl The reporter was
there, of course. But the tristful sons of Tem-
perance got a sickening crusher that day. While
their mournful merriment was at its highest and
the ginger-beer bottles exploded madly on every
side-a fusillade of flzz-the police-van drew
grimly up to the fence. The harmony of the day
was over. Each picaicer looked gloomily at the
other, and when the evening came departed home

that the van was sent out by a new inspector was
Justly considered too thin by the Temperance
Lodges. The Insult had sunk too deeply.
It seems a strangely paradoxical fact that
the poorest and most badly-paid of the working
classes in England are to be found in the ranks of
those women who are employed sewing and bind-
ing Bibles. The Pall Mall Gazette says:—“For
every heathen who la induced by the missionary
to use the pages of the sacred volume for any-
thing else than gun waddimr, a dozen of these
girls are sent to perdition at home.” But wlwt
rustlers this so the naked savage receives the socks
and samplers of civilisation and the Bible and
tracts of true religion. Our own women are in the
midst of Christian influences, they should nctgo
astray. The missionary-loving savage must be
enlightened at any cost. The 99 white women who
fall are weighed in the balance against the black
who is saved, and the ebony-visaged convert has
weight to spare then.
A rich reply was given by a porter at a
Melbourne suburban station when asked why he
did not come on duty at the proper time. 1
couldn’t,” he said, with a pious smile, “ becuz I
wuz attendin’ of my dooty at the Salvation
Harmy.” The authorities did not dismiss him,
but they sent him up country to a siding where
the sound of the Harmy drum had not yet pene-
trated so that he might be out of the reach of its
maddening Influence. He had not the moral fibre
to refuse to go and throw in his lot with the Devil
Demolishes. “ What doth it profit a man to keep
his portershlp and lose his own soul ?” This man
evidently thought it profited so much a week
more than the Harmy could give him. Foolish
manl He will be crying out to Lazarus for a

Here is a wonderful instance of what a
paragraph in the Evening News of Saturday last
achieved. In the “Brevity” column, a wharf
labourer came across this piece of news;—“l hope
we shall have a ham and potatoe banquet this
year,” said a member of the plumber s picnic
committee on Friday night. “ Let us get on with
the business,” said a member, and they did so.
That is all. The man turned fho paper upside
down to try and discover the joke; he doubled
the thing into a ball and tried to squeeze humour
or news, or anything at all out of it. It haunted
him all Saturday night; was mixed up in the par-
son’s sermon on Sunday, and finally brought out
elongation of the tonsure, and varicose veins in
the armpit. Late on Sunday he was observed in
Market-street with a pneumatic force pump under
his arm, clamouring for the " Brevity ” man to
come down and have some brains injected into
bis knowledge-box.
Aa a rule, we do not publish, snake stories

snake sitting under a fence fanning himself with
his tail, and immediately started for him. It was ‘
lun for the snake at flrijt, but, as the dog seemed
to have plenty of foot and bottom, and they (pur

mile down a lane, the snake, looking back at a
dog remarked, “ It's a long lane that never tv ohe

It appears that the wives of English Con-
servative candidates have taken to kissing the
electors to secure votes. We always thought there
was luck in store for “Hodge.” To come away
from the plough every six or seven years and be
kissed by a real lady ought to reconcile any one to
seven shillings a week, and a pint of beer on Sun-
days. It is thought the new electors will strike at
once for annual Parliaments. We trust the cus-
tom will not be introduced into the colonies. If it
were, few voters would go to the poll. The great

Our
Children's
Column
We don’t wish to disguise the fact that we
borrowed the idea of this column from the Sydney
Town and Country Journal. There Is no pride
about us. If we see any of our local contem-
poraries adopting a good plan we gratefully fol-
low in their lead. Hitherto we have not seen any-
thing in the Journal which we would care to
imitate, but the idea of publishing letters from
very young (and marvellously precocious) contri-
butors seems to be little short of inspiration—it
fills up so much space. Our young friends have
proved themselves equal to the occasion, and for
epistolary ability we will back them to knock spots
off anything their size and weight that Alfred
can produce. We did think of asking a number
of the inmates of Callan Park Lunatic Asylum to

And just here we stop to notice that Inspectors of
Nuisances generally manage to keep close to the
local aldermen—probably thinking that by so
doing they can best keep an eye on the most pro-
minent and aggressive nuisances In the borough.
Foiled in our efforts to evolve a sparkle from the
classes enumerated, we went one better in the
B oale of intelligence, and having appealed to the
c hildren, obtained about a bushel of letters from
which we select a few samples. There is a spice of
historic interest about this effusion; the writer
will probably be a Hallam—or a railway fettler :
“Dear Bully,— Christmas before last I had two
big serves of pudding, and I wasn’t very well
after it, so this last Christmas mother said I should
only have one serve, and as soon as she put the

were more reliable than Nooze brevities. He

On the crowded block you will find him;
A suit of tweed he has girded on,
And his coat tails hang behind him.
And he sings as he paces the crowded street,
While the people crowd to hear him—
“ Those pants which Summbrfibld sells are neat,
And for price none else come near him.”*
For loss of appetite, general debility, im-
pairment of the organs of the body, Wolfe’s
Schnapps is the best remedy known.

These are all that we have space for at present,
If the silly season lasts much longer we will trot
out the little girls, and permit them to Spread a
soft odour of bread and jam over these pages, and
we will go all we are wcrth that our female in-

An English paper says that an analysis
the lunacy returns reveals the “ remarkable ” fa
that “ Government messengers and workmen anc
ministers of religion ” enjoy almost absolute
munlty from lunacy. There is nothing remar
able in this. To describe a man as a lunatic yo
must presuppose that he had a sound mind, w:
will say that men of the classes named have an
mind atall-or, if they have, that there Is an
thing in their occupation which is likely to u
hinge it 7
We get a good many letters like the fo

The manager of the Empire Club, London

Here is an account of the latest English
execution. It is well to keep a record of them
Public archives will be to the student of the
future as Interesting as the Tower of London is
to us. They will show the barbarism of the people
who reconcile themselves to the like of this:—
’ The prison clock struck 8, the trap was released
and the culprit, Robert Goodale, disappeared. To
the surprise of the spectators the halter imme-
diately recoiled. Upon the warders running to
the pit, they found that the sudden shook and the
weight of the victim’s body had caused the head
to become entirely severed from the body.
Goodale stood sft. llln., and weighed 15at, and the
hangman allowed a drop of six feet.”
Whatever Graham Berry may have to

will be held accountable for. Madame is the

Ihe shares now stand at £3O, and the problem
With speculators is which way will the rich gutter
run, aud whither will it turn on getting out of tho
confines of the Berry claim? This claim is so
large that the problem cannot be practically
solved therein for another sov*-n years, judging
by the progress made during the last four. Ac
north and north-east lies the Berry Consols, the
Berry No. 3, the Earl Beaconsfleld, and the Hep-
burn Estate claims. In all these mines the shares
stand at from £5 to £7. on the probability, which is
a mere possibility only, that the Madame Berry

read of old that “faith could remove mountains.”

From the B.F. Argonaut:— “For years
half the editorial columns in amateurdom, roughly
estimated, have contained at the top, in small
type, Amateur Journalism! the noblest imtitu--
uon ever engaged in by the American youth.'—
Speaker Randall. Tnis expression ■ originated
curiously. One day a delegation of amateurs
waited upon the Speaker to secure, if possible,
ms aid in obtaining for them second-class rates.
He was busy, and all the boys could get out of
him was, I don t know anything about amateur
journalism. ‘Well,’ persisted one of the visi-
tors, don t you think it is the noblest institution
ever engaged m by the American youth?’
Thunder I yes ; I suppose so; I am busy,
answered the statesman.”
At the Newcastle, N.8.W., Police Court,
lately, it was feared that some difficulty would
arise in swearing the witnesses in an assault case
between Mahommedans. There was no copy of
the Koran obtainable, but the witnesses obligingly
* C u ODBe o to be sworn on the revised edition of
the Bibie. This willingness to overcome the
obstacle to their testimony being received proved
that they would quite as readily have taken the
oath on a copy of Webster's Unabridged or the last
Government Gazette. They declared the oath
taken on the Bible to be binding on their con-
sciences. No doubt it was. go would an oath on
the Koran be to some of our Christian witnesses
in Courts of Justice. Many of them would take 40
oaths for a deep sinker ”
Three agricultural labourers went begging
in the streets of London one day lately. They
promptly found themselves in the Westminster
Court. .The presiding magistrate ordered
their hands to be examined. The asffstant-g oler
performed the operation, and testified that the
men had done a good deal of hard work in their
time. As you nave done a good deal of hard
work in your lime,” said the magistrate, “ I’ll only
give you three day* apiece,** Sydney is the anti-
podes or London. When men are brought to court
here their best chance for tin easy let-down lies in
their sho wing that they never did any hard work
at ail. If they can show beside that they have
connections who never do any Hard work either,
be at once let out, or pn adjournment
will be made to enable someone to fix the matter
up and stop further proceeding.
Three and four years ago Melbourne and
victoria generally had a tin-mining lever. It
raged virulently then as the land fever has been
lately doing. The locality from which the trea-
sure of tin was to be got was chiefly at Heems-
klrk, on the Tasmanian coast, one of the hun-
dred claims taken uo there was “the Montagu”
adj dniag to the “Cromwell” claim. The latter
collapsed a year ago, and left its costly machinery
imported trom America, rotting on the ground!
Toe Montagu has hai better luck—just a little
better and that is all. All its property—lease,
buiidinga machinery, tools, and everything, lock
stock, and barrel—were sold off by auction last
wee^ il l Melb ? urae ' and fetched £5Ol Three years
ago ~oshares mtl-.e company would have fetched
this amount. It is old Solomon, we believe, who
writes ot riches making unto itself wings.”
Melbourne publicans take a lot of beating.
The other day one of them had a visit from the
excise rhfleer, who wanted to inspect his stock of
grog. The officer soon discovered that bonlface
had some inferior brandy in a bottle labelled with
Hennessy s brand, and at once seized the bottle,
and. Intimated his intention of prosecuting. Before
taking the bottle away the excise officer ailowe i
e ,fi ubli + a w t< l pufca Eeal on the bottle so as it
could not ba tampered with before it was pro-
ducedm court. The day before the case was to
be heard, the hotelkeeper called at H.M. Custom-
house, and asked to be permitted to inspect the
bottle. His request w«s at once complied with.
P, übllcai i accidentally (as it were) dropped
the bottle on the floor, anu its contents dls-
appeared. The next day the case was called on in
JP e there was no appearance, as
the defendant had destroyed the only means of
evidence against him.
After an Englishman bad done talking
about Captain Mathew Webb, and extolling his
merits as a swimmer, a Yankee rose and addressed
the meeting. “ Gentlemen,—Some years ago a
good many now, it came on to rain pretty heavy.
Forty days according to the Book. That was the
most consecutive spell of dampness on record
An old Boston whaler, namtd Noah, put to sea and
laetd the Mmt weather. Ho had an assortment of
birds and beasts and creeping things, together
with his wife and some relations. After he had
been riding the graie a fortnight, one exceptionally
wet day a Yankee drew up alongside and hailed

in. Can’t, ain’t got enough provender for the
animals, it this wot spell holds out.’ ‘But I'm
getting wet to the skin.’ ‘ Can't help that.’ ‘Oh,
well, retdied the Yank, as he cleaved the brine
with a strong over-arm stroke, ‘shove along wit:
your —— menagerie, it's only a passing shower.’
And once more they recited the little story of G
Washington. By the way, its no wonder th
Americans set a lot of store by Washington—ther
are so few over there like him.
If a man is attacked by one stronger in
muscle and more skilled in boxing and wrestlin
than himself is he justified in using any othe
weapons but those with which nature has pro
vided him ? The Herald says decidedly ho is no
so justified; that he is a cowardly rascal. On Fri
day last an honest man seized a thief. “Th
thief,” eays the report, ‘‘made a frantic effort to
get away from the iron grip of the other, who is
powerful man, and, on finding that assistance wa
lutile, the cowardly rssaal took a handkerchief,
which was a stone, from his pocket, and strucl
his captor over the eye.” Putting aside the fac
that one man was honest and the other a thief
Herald ethics teach us that powerful men with i
grip of iron must only be opposed with doublet
fists; bank managers who use revolvers to repe
burglars henceforth must be branded as cowards
Tiny Films, as he walks aorosj Hyde Park at la m
after sending the news-formes to press, must dls

So the Duke of Bedford intends to “ secede
from the Liberal ranks,” if Mr. Gladstone yields to
the demands of “justice for Ireland.” Reuter
cabled over the news as though it indicated
grave calamity. Great Scott I The professed
Liberalism of toe Duke of Bedford has never been
other than a grim joke. The old man is, from
family tradition and narrow-minded inclination
the most hopelessly irreelalmacle of Tories, buct
a one as the Marquis of Salisbury is an advancer
reformer compared with “ Liberals ” of Bedford’s
stamp. The Duke is ground landlord of all the
property round Covont Garden, and to his miser-
able pig headed and grasping policy the scandal-
ous condition of London's fruit and vegetable
market is attributable. The dear Duke opposes
improvements tooth and nail. Leases on the Bed-
ford estates are more autocratic in their drafting
than those of any other London landowner. He
has clostdwhat would be popular thoroughfares
with big iron gates, to the inconvenience of thou-
sands of the public. Ail the Duke’s life has been
devoted to opposing progress where he dared, and
his name is held In contempt by the Radical Press.
This is the man who threatens to secede from the
Liberal ranks if any liberties are granted to the
Irish, May he keep his word. Freed from such
an incubus the Liberal ranks will march along a
little quicker.
The Salvation Army ’vert who gave him-
self away by owning up on the penitent’s form to
a robbery committed in Melbourne many moons
before, and who received a three-years’ “ stretch
in the stir,” for his trouble, is likely to have his
broad arrow-stamped laurels captured by an Ade-
laide ess, who bears the dulcet name of George
Robert Scrymgore. In a recent issue of the South
Australian Aljvhrti3er George inserted the
following startling ad,:—“Dear Jane,—l hereby
swear that I was duly married at the Supreme
Court House, Adelaide, to one Jane Thompson
Caldwell. Ido not recollect the date nor the year,
but 1 think it was in the year 1869 (in May), and
knowing the same to be true when I married you,
I was deceiving you, but it was my great love for
rou, dear, that made me do it, dear. I know now
that my first wife is living, and that you are free
to marry whoever you like. I hereby swear thatl
married Mary Jane Larkin under a false name, and
having signed my name Walter, when I knew it to
be George Robert Scrymgore* The above is
strictly true, and I call God as my witnes. (Signed)
George Robert Scrymgore. You can get my
marriage lines by sending to the Supreme Court-
house, Adelaide.” By calling at her Majesty’s
Gaol, Adelaide, dear Jane will probably be able to
get her guileless George as well, for a clearer con-
fession of bigamy is not yet on record. It may be
possible that Mr. Scrymgore is tired of his new
love, and wishes to get on with his old love once
more, but the probabilities are he is tired of both,
and his medical adviser, like Mr. Garrett’s, orders
a spell of holy calm and dignified retirement.
Two hundred children from the Progres-
sive Lyceum and Secular Sunday School held their
annual picnic at Athol Gardens on Sunday last.
They marched from West’s Booms in Castlereagh-
street to the Circular Quay behind a brass band,
waving banners on which were Inscribed their
mottos and the names of the pioneers of Free-
thought ail over the world. They tramped along
gaily in all the pomp and circumstance of peace,
innocence, and Sunday clothes. No one hooted
them or stoned them \ the police did not take their
names and address. A notable sign of the times
my masters, the most reverend. On their arrival
at the Gardens they revelled in games of every
description and sang af Intervals, for the delecta-
tion of some 800 visitors. Then they ate and
danced it down, and ate and danced again, and so
on, da capo. W, W. Collins spoke a few kindly
words to them during the afternoon. He told
them of the power, the enormous possibilities
of littlo things, even such little ones as they were;
he then reminded th6m of the great responsibili-
ties which were theirs in the future. A May-pole
dance concluded the day’s sport. It was a pretty
sight and made every one feel quite beatific; no
one thought it wrong, the sun shone as if it was
a pleasure to him, tne bretze kept stealing up
from the bay bringing little invigorating whiffs of
the briny with him. The Devil was not present,
we looked behind several trees but failed to un-
earth him: we didn’t even discover a hull-dog ant,
but we saw a policeman, who had the grace to
seem quite ashamed of himself, his duties were
so clearly somewhere else. We watched him, he
was sorely tempted to doff his garb of authority
and join in the May-pole dance, but as there was
not room for hi.i feet in the circle he wisely re-
frained. We went dswn in the Young Mick, a
boat admirably suited for an aquatic funeral, but
somewhat out of place at a one-day s picnic.
It is acknowledged on all sides in England
that it was only the Irish vote and influence that
saved the Tory parly from the most ignominious
of defeats at the recent election. Had the Irish
been left to their own devices, and been allowed
to support the Liberals, the followers of Glad-
stone and Chamberlain would have been numerous
enough to outvote the Tories and Parnellites
combined. As it is. Mr. Parnell stands as arbiter
pugnac, curing nothing for the differences of par-
ties, but able to make Government impossible un-
less his demands be conceded. Mr. T. P. O’Con-
nor, who is credited with all the glory of the re-
c?D t 9 ou P< when Interviewed by a representative of
the Pall Mall Gazette, produced lists to prove
that no less than 65 Liberals had been defeated in
Rngiand and Scotland by means of the compact
Home Rule vote against them. Although the
Irish vote in many constituencies was numerically
insignificant, yet in cases when the parties were
equally divided the solid vote of the Irish was all
important. “In future,” says Mr. O Connor, “the
88 a sword la the hands of the leaders
of ttae National League, to be cast into which ever
scale they deo;de. It will be disposed of solid in
toe interests of Irelar d, with absolute disregard of
interests of English narties.” He says
lurcher that the approach of Home Rule is “as
certain as the rising of the sun. A solid
phalanx of 86 pledged Nationalists in the centre of
I* ollB ® of Commons is the governing fact of
the situation. The Liberals may go in, the Tories
may come out, but that makes no difference to us.
We shall use both parties with a single eye to
Ireland s well-being. We have a definite purpose,
aad a Party as solid as a stone
wall. We hold the fortunes of the Conservatives in
the hollow of our bands.” Mr. O'Connor defines
Home Rule as being; “Ireland like Canada.
No Irish members in the Imperial Parlia-
ment. No contributions for the TmronG
expenditure. No share in the National o‘bt-
Ireland, In short like Canada.” Despite the
tact that £13,000 a year will have to be paid
to the Irish members to support them in
London during: the Session, the Parnellltes do not
anticipate any trouble in the collection of that or
a much greater amount. Irishmen in every
foreign land have made the cause their own, and
subscribe with the utmost eagerness, so that Mr.
O’Connor is confident of being able to raise four
times as much if required. He is a worthy lieu-
tenant to Mr. Parnell, How is it that all the
O’Connors are clever I Hero, in Sydney, we have
the “ jaynil ” ore, and J, G. both worthy
bearers of the historic name.
We ranged up alongside a shoeblack’s
place of business on Friday afternoon to get our
uppers polished. He had his grievance. Life
even to a shoeblack is not all sunshine. •• Th»-se is
a easy pair to shine, sir,” he remarked. “Yes.”
we replied, “ we weir none but the most expen-
sive goods." “Ah," he continued, as he laid a
half inch coat of Day and Martin on the extremity
of our pants, and patted our pet corn with the
heel of his fist, “ I gets some rough 'uns here some-
times; yesterday one o’ them there Sydney Lan-
cers sent me down a new pair of long boots to be
burnished. Well, it took four coats o’ blackin’
and an ’our’s work. You know what new boots is
—(we confessed to an occasional acquaintance
with the novelty)—and I rubbed till my arms
ached. When he sent the boy for them ne for-
warded threepence. I put it back in the boot and
another threepence in the other one, and told the
boy to give my compliments to the Lancer and
say I was sorry he was a little short.” “You’ll
clean them again,” wo remarked. “If 1 do, may I
be—lanced,” he observed emphatically. “Thank
you, all right, sir, good day.” And as we stepped
off the pavement a dog put his muddy fest on our
clean boots. It was the shoeblaek’s partner.
“Rivals for supremacy in the Pacific,” is
the title of a 53-page pamphlet by General M’lvor,
the hero who wields the pen with same facility
as the sword, and who has covered himself with
glory, and Fourteen Flags, even as others cover
themselves with raiment. In spite of Bismarck’s
repeated assurances that he " vouldn’t do Id,”
the doughty General declares the wily old saur-
kraut worrier’s aim la to annex Holland, and
scoop in the Dutch colonies around, as well. The
General’s views on this subject being as well
known as Sir John’s are on his own eternal Land
Act, there is no need to go further into detail,
but there is one little matter connected with the
pamphlet which must make the well-tried warrior
feel fit to wrap his head in his 14 flags, in sheer
desperation. The preface to the pamphlet leads
gaily off in this style:—“An article bearing simi-
lar title to this pamphlet was communicated by
me to the Queensland Review, and appeared
in the September issue of that publication.
It attracted so much attention that many
of our Northern friends suggested that I
should republish it in a form in which its circula-
tion throughout Astralia. Tasmania, and New Zea-
land weuld be assured. Hence the present work.”
The real facts of the case, however, are that, in
consequence of a little business turn-up between
the proprietor of the Queensland Review and his
printers (over which there will probably be some
court work), the September number of that
journal, though in print, has not yet been made
public. The General, being in Sydney at the time,
knew nothing of the row, and was, consequently,
unaware of the sad fact that no one except the
editor and printers have yet seen the celebrated
article which caused such a profound sensation
that the author’s Northern friends went down on
their knees and refused to rise until he promised
to yield to their imploring entreaties, and repub-
lish It in a form which would enable them to wear
it in their shirt-bosoms alongside of the Bibles
presented to them by their dying mothers.

The announcement that Lord and Lady
Carington and suite intended to honour Mrs. Arm-
strong’s concert by their presence last Friday
night drew like a porous plaster; and drew people,
too, who cared about as much about music as poor
General Grant, but who were well content to part
with their ss. in order to be amongst the fashion-
able crowd. The ladies were, almost without ex-
ception, most elegantly attired— in fact, not a few
were in full ball costume. This was unnecessary,
as the chief lady of the land wore a quiet looking
black dress and small crimson plush opera tippet;
whilst the Hon. Judith Harbord was attired in
cream broohe made high to the neck and elbow
sleeves, with one large bunch of crimson flowers
on the corsage; her hair ornament consisted or a
long jewelled bar-pin. Mrs. M'Quade wore a rich
cream satin dress; and Mrs. Moulton looked very
elegant in a handsome cream brocade with watteau
train, the skirt being caught here and there with
beautiful orange-coloured ostrich feathers. This
same dress was the admiration of everybody at the
last American ball. Mrs. Paget-Bayley looked very
nice in black, the front of the skirt being one
glittering mass of jet lace. A small bunch
of pink-blush roses worn in front of the
corsage had a very pretty effect. Miss Marks
also wore black, and a black velvet band round
her fair neck, fastened with a jewel, was in nice
keeping with the prettily made frock. The Misses
Perks wore rich-looking cream surah dresses, re-
lieved by crimson sashes. Miss Ada Senior s blue
dress suited her fair complexion to a nicety. Mrs.
Armstrong was a pretty picture in a French, white
lace skirt and long rich silk train, long cream
gloves and floral ornaments. Mrs. Mic Donald_ wore
pure white lace, and Mrs. RHey white and helio-
trope; Madame Charbonnet Killermann, white and
cerise silk. Almost without exception the per-
formers in the first part of the programme were
“off colour,*’ probably due to nervousness, conse-
quent upon the presence of His Excellency. The
part singing was very mediocre, and Mons. de
Wlllimoff always spoils his otherwise charming
violin solos when he does not play from memory.
It is something quite novel to express dissatis-
faction with Mr. Hallewell’s singing, but it is
quite certain that upon this particular occasion
the basso was quite as conscious of his short-
comings as was his audience. A man can t always
be at his best. Mrs. McDonald began her solo
(“Roberto tu cho adore”) in a breatnlees sort of
way, as it she had had a run for it,
but soon her clear full voice recovered itself,
and the latter part, at all events, was
carefully and skilfully rendered. Mrs. Armstrong
made a good choice of a solo in “ Ombra Leg-
giera,” and had a most enthusiastic reception.
Her voice, besides being sweetly sympathetic, is
so well cultivated that it seems to run on wheels—
well greased wheels, too —and her unaffected de-
livery is very charming. For encore she gave
•• Bid me good bye.” Mr. Percy Jones was in good
voice, but hurried his singing somewhat. A
string quartette, for violin, viola, ’cello and piano,
opened the second part of the programme, and
made a nice variety. After singing ” Ave Marla
the benejiciare received a presentation from her
musical friends of Sydney, which consisted of a
handsome gold medal. Of course it couldn t be
presented without the aid of tne man who pos-
sesses the handsomest gray oycs and beam in
Sydney, and also the gift of the ga at least of
eloquence. Mrs. Armstrong was too overcome, or
perhaps, too shy to audibly express her thanks,
but as she looked them it was enough. Herr
Patek’s ’cello solo was rather unworthy of him,
though his tone and technique were praise-
worthy. Madame Kellermam , holding a bou-
quet in hor right hand, as if to prove
that "there warn’t no deception about this,
ladles and gentlemen,” played her left hand
piece from “ Martha,” braoketted with which was
Brisson’s “1/ Arabesque,” a delightful morceau
and excellently played. Mrs. Riley was not at her
best in “Because oi thee,” but her second best is
Quite a good thing. Mr. Knight Aston sung a very
pretty song, “A smile for every tear,” almost
nicely, but he strains his voice far too much. I or
her last song Mrs. Armstrong chose “ Sing, sweet
bird,” which was certainly the gem of the even-
ing and, although it was the last item on the pro-
gramme, nothing short of a repetition of the last
verse would satisfy the people. After tne concert
was over, Lady Carington requested that Mrs.
Armstrong: should he presonted to her, and stayed
chatting pleasantly with the cantatrice for several
minutes. The concert was under the direction of
Mr Huenerbein, ivho also undertook the tedious
duty of playing all the accompaniments.

The fraternity of Mutual Imps are evi-
dently finding it too cold for them up in these re-
gions; for they had a big fire in their rooms in
Pitt-street the other day—were burnt out, in tact.
They have been obliged to take refuge for the
time being in their old quarters at Baumann s.

presents to the bride were remarkable lor their
beauty and value, and amply testified to the high
esteem in which she is held by her luends.

A very enjoyable evening was spent in
theT beautiful'ball-room of Chats worth, Potts
Point, on Wednesday evening, when about 30
people assembled, and did borough Justice to the
perfect floor. The hostess (Mrs. C. J. Roberts)
wore a verv becoming gown of striped velvet and
gilk, in black, the bodice out square and jetted all
over, diamond necklet, and star in front of the
hair. Her daughters wore frocks of pink and
blue respectively. Mrs. Williams was attired in
black lace; Mias Severn, in white, relieved with
heliotrope ribbons; Miss Hill donned a black
velvet, cut low, and short sleeves, displaying very
white shoulders and arms, the skirt relieved with
a large cardinal sash; Miss Hill, in pale-blue
gauze, with rings of satin ribbon around the
skirt, demi-traln, blue satin bodice, cut low;
Miss Fisher, in a soft cream silk, trimmings
of maize, a round fan of natural flowers;
the Misses Hardie were dressed alike in pale
heliotrope with swansdown around the low
corsage; Mies Benson, in white tulle; Miss Spier,
in black. Amongst the guests were Mrs. Prisby,
Miss Gilder, Miss Harnett, Miss Burdett-Smith,
Captain Terry, A.D.C., Mr- Lee, A.D.C., Mr. Gar-
butt, Dr. Williams. Mr. N. B. Hill, Mr. N. Hill, Mr.

about 13 o’clock after spending a very pleasant
time.

A fancy dress ball was given at Singleton

The Association Ground was lively on
Saturday afternoon, the first day of the fnter-
c flomal cricket match, and the ladies who sat m
the stand or paraded the lawn had donned their
very best bibs and tuckers for the occasion. The
Governor put in an appearance in gray dittoes
and light gray felt hat at about 4 o’clock, and
appeared to be much interested m the game.
Lady Carington and Miss Harbord arrived about
an hour later, the former attired in light blue, and
the latter in navy-blue, probably in compliment
to the colours of the cricketers. Miss Throck-
morton wore an extremely elegant dress of ficelle
canvas, unrelieved by any colour, small styl sb.
bonnet, and long suede gloves, and carried a not
too fresh looking crimson sunshade. Mrs. Pinhey
was gowned in a brown costume, small brown
straw bonnet with light blue gauze veil; Miss Day
wore a cream dress and a quaint hat of cream lace
and heliotrope satin bows. A “fetching” cos-
tume was a pure white dress, with a profusion of
buttercup-ribbon loops scattered over the skirt,
and a tiny bonnet composed entirely of butter-
cups. Miss Playfair looked pretty in electric
blue, and Miss Spenceria white; Miss Eva Thomp-
son, fawn satin and lace dress, with bonnet to
match, ornate with pale-pink plumes ; Miss
Fischer, white dress with dark waistband and small
yellow straw bonnet. A most peculiar-looking
costume was of biscuit canvas, trimmed with
prune velvet and large oblong toque to match—-it
was decidedly more peculiar than elegant. An
aggressive-looking pale magenta dress showed
atrocious taste, worn as it was in conjunction
with a yellow bonnet and green parasol. Many of
the sun shades were very gorgeous, those which,
instead of being stretched tivht over the frames,
were fluted, being amongst the prettiest. The
square shape does not seem to gain much in popu-
larity, and certainly hau nothin* to recommend it
beyond being a fashionable freak. Mrs. E. Barton
wore cream printed delaine,with close-fitting straw
bonnet; Mrs. Darley, in a stylish costume of
black: Mrs. French, white landa, with moss-green
foliage bonnet; Mrs. Coppinger, a handsome
dress of black surah satin, lace, and red velvet,
high black bonnet, with red plume—a decidedly
good costume; Mrs. F. Moore, neat ficelle gown,
with small, close-fltticig brown toque; Mrs.
Bouverie, an exceedingly pretty costume of
cream lace grenadine, prune shot silk, bonnet and
parasol enmite ; Mrs. Sidney Want looked hand-
some, as usual, in white lawn, with black and
white bonnet; Mrs. Fairfax Ross, white, with
pale Roman sash white bonnet, and cardinal
parasol: Mrs. S. W. Gray, a pretty costume of
cream Indian silk; Mrs. W. E. Mort white
Belgian crape, trimmed with white lace,
white straw bonnet, with bunch of pale yellow
flowers; Miss Kmgdon wore white with a gold
gauze butterfly bonnet; Miss Clara Manning,
white china silk with red collar and cuffs, white
straw hat and field flower*. The military element
was fully represented on Saturday. Among others
we saw Major-General Richardson, who looks ex-
ceedingly well after his three months’ holiday in
India. Monday was a wet, drizzly day, and only
a few of the most enthusiastic lady-lovers ot
cricxet ventured to the grounds. The result
balanced the hopes of both parties, for Victoria
didn’t score heavily. On Tuesday, manifold attrac-
tions drew people various ways, so that no day
excelled Saturday in the brilliance of the spec-
tators. „ * *

Lady Carington is a perfect equestrienne,
and delights in riding. Her habit is of dark
leather-brown cloth, made just to cover the foot;
the bodice ends in a round basque, which is a
slight variety from the ordinary coat-tail coat.
Her hat is a low-crowned hard felt of the same
shade as her habit.

Despite the damp drizzle on Monday after-
noon, Miss Young’s reception was numerously at-
tended. Tbe youthful Mayoress received her
guests gracefully and amiably, and was attired in
a pale-cream broohe satin embellished with lace of
the same faiac tint, and a moire sash, long cream
kid gloves, and a bunch of green leaves at her
taroat. Herr Kuster conducted a nice picked
band, the first item they played being a grand
reception march, which in parts sounded uncom-
monly like the “ War March ot the Priests, but
which was composed specially for the occasion by
Herr Kuster, and dedicated to Mies Young.
Whether it is advisable to give a full afternoon
concert at these social gatherings is questionable.
Many people would far rather move about and
cnat with their various friends in the room than
be compelled to sit still and listen to music whicn,
as likely as not, they are unable to appreciate. A
few musical selections are seldom amiss, but,
although the Intention was of the best, the concert
of 13 items was a mistake. Madame Kellermann
and the Misses Lambert and Saville were the lady
performers, and Messrs. Ilaitewell and bear! the
gentlemen. The orchestra played really well, and
for those who were in the vein for enjoying music
the selection from “Faust” must have been a
treat. There was nothing very striking amongst
the ladies' costumes, but, at the same time,
nearly everybody was well dressed. Miss Youngs
wore a very beautiful bronze satin and
pink satin jabot, tha same two colours being re-
peated in her bonnet; Mrs. Evans was attired in a
snuff-coloured dress, draped with a rich striped
satin of divers colours, small witch-shaped bonnet
of white straw; Mrs. Roberts was clad in a black
silk dress, with crimson velvet cuffs, small bonnet
covered with blue-beaded net; Mits Roberts also
wore black and cardinal, but a green straw hat
nartially spoilt the effect of a nice dress; Mrs. ifi.
Barton was in a becoming dress of olive-green
surah and cream lace; Mrs. Triokett, in black
with mauve and white aigrette in her bonnet;
Mrs. Adams, black satin, with white straw bonnet,
trimming salmon-pink aigrette and black velvet;
Mrs.Purves wore a striking costume ofjsoft cream,
the tabller richly appiiqued with a crushed straw-
berry design, and edged with handsome lace of the
same shade, bonnet of crushed strawberry tulle;
Mrs. Carl Fischer, bUcklace costume, with black
bonnet and mauve leathers; Miss Fischer, a
pretty fete gown of pale-blue and deep cream
Chantilly lace, a neat close-fitting bonnet to match
set off her bright piquante face to perfection;
Mrs. King, a handsome black mervellleux
relieved by jet trimming; Mrs. Qullett, golden
brown satin, with an embossed design in
pale stone, high-peaked brown and gold
bonnet; Mrs. H. Mort, black lacs costume;
Madame Kellermann, black satin and lace dress,
bonnet of gold gauze, veiled with pink lace, a
double row of pearls round the edge, and trimmed
with pink plumes; Mrs. Dr. Foreman, black broche
gown, gold necklet, and pretty old gold satin
bonnet; Miss Plavfalr, electric blue silk, and
small white hat; Miss Miison, black broche and
lace; Mrs. Spencer, black broche; Miss t Spencer,
cream dress, and large white straw hat; a slight
lady wore a pretty black and white costume, the
dress of black satin had the front width composed
of a beautiful white satin, patterned with small
black velvet dice, small black lace bonnet and
white strings. Plentiful refreshments were pro-
vided, but there were those among the crowd
who seemed to think nobody required any but
themselves, for when once they took their posi-
tions round the tables no power on earth
was strong enough to move thom until
their by no means small appetites were sati*ted.
Very few gentlemen attended the reception— very
few indeed —for tnose things who, upon leaving,
rushed the cabs and rudely ignored the fact that
tlnw had been called to accommodate ladles,
surely don’t count as such. In some instances, a
couple of ladies, who would be too timid to press
their claim to the cab called for them, would be
kept waiting fully 10 minutes on the wet steps,
till at last, perhaps, it would dawn upon the cab-
crier that they were being badly treated, where-
upon he would be compelled to use not a little in-
sistanoe to see that they got their rights. It was
truly pitiful to witness such under-breeding in a
British community, and it can only be hoped that
these moneyed.larrikins are hardly a fair sample
of our Sydney men.

On the 20bh Inst., at St. Thomas’ Church,
St. Leonards, the eldest daughter of Mr. C. Cowles

French-grey costume, trimmed with myrtle-green
velvet, small bonnet to match of exquisite design,
gold jewellery. Tim three bridesmaids were
attired in cream delaine, and each carried beauti-
ful bouquets. Honeymoon at Sandringham.

The annual meeting in connection with the

last Thursday and Friday, but as bad luck would
have it, the rain came down in torrents the first

were brought to a climax by a most enjoyable
ball, held in the Agricultural room, which was
attended by many Sydney and Goulburn belles.

Sydney, "Wednesday.
My Dear Belle,— “ Six whole months without
a single line from my devoted Mab I ” Thus you
exclaim through yesterday’s post. I heartily sym-
path.sa with you, dear, for existence must Indeed
oe sad and heavy without the budget of weekly
gossip with whioa I was wont to regale you. Yes,
Indeed, But now that I am back in dear old
Sydney, after a pleasant, if rather hurried, Euro-
pean tour, I mean to still devote an hour a week
to writing to the dearest friend I ever had.
Let me tell you, before going into Sydney af-
fairs, that we colonial cornstalks stand comparison
with English. French, or German girls remarkably
well. We aren’t so matter-of-fact as the English,
go Mighty as the French, nor so phlegmatic as the
Germans! and, somehow, life for us seems to have
moret)im-we are more alive to things going on
around us : and perhaps ennui is less known to us
toan to any of them. It’s true that in England
they found fault with us for being un-methodical;
and in Switzerland they stand aghast at our thin-
soled shoes: whilst in France our Parisian cousins
laughed so immoderately at our French accent
(which, before leaving Sydney, we flattered our-
selves was so pure) that it must indeed have been
very droll. Oh, you Sydney professors, how cruel
of you to alio w us to think we were so perfect in
your lingo I Certainly, we had neither a Jules nor
a Pulteau in our school days, or things might have
been different with us. But, apart from the lan-
guages, we found our other accomplishments well
up to pitch, but—must I say it?-we are really
dreadful walkers. Why 1s this, I wonder ? Per-
haps it is because we practice the art so little—are
too fond of riding or driving. Why, if wo walk
tho length of two or three blocks we are ready to
drop with fatigue, whilst to the strong, fresh-look-
iog English girls a constitutional of two or three
miles is counted as nothing. lam sorry about the
walking, dear, for I hate to think we are behind In
anything; but we can dance—oh, certainly, we
have no cause to blush for our dancing.
That the past season has been a particularly gay
and lively one it needed but a glance at the hun-
dreds of faces at Lady Carington’s last reception
to tell mo. The young girls had more the ap-
pearance of drooping lilies than bright, budding
roses, and all looked more or less blasS. The
elderly dames showed to far better a ivantage,
hut rouge and face powder had probably a good
deal to answer for in this. As years roll over us
we seem to have less and less antipathy to wear
sham complexions or so it would seem, judging
by the beautiful bloom usually seen upon the
cheeks of our fashionable dames here. It must be
passing sad for a woman who has depended solely
upon her beauty to make her acceptable in the
eyes of man to feel her charms beginning to de-
cay. No wonder she takes refuge in paste, powder,
and all tho rest of it. Men say that women are not
so lovely now as in past generations, which re-
minds me that a certain oculist announces that
Englishmen will all be spectacled 50 years hence,
and a friend of mine (a man, of course) says that
“ it is a singular evidence of the pressure of a law
of balance in nature, that the pUiner the female sex
grows the more near-sighted men become, i'hen,
as man fastens on spectacles, woman lays on paint.
Mo the two halves of creation go on ‘ facing ’
with confidence ” As to women being plainer now
than they were 100 years ago, I’m sure £ don’t know,
as I was rather young then to be a judge on such
matters, but as to men being near-sighted, I just
wish they were a little more so, don’t you ? They
Bee far more than we want them to usually and
far, far more than is good for them.
There is something dreadfully hollow about
Sydney society. At least, so I thought the
other day when, upon making a call upon one of
our leaders of fashion, 1 found that she and about
half a dozen more ladies were in close confab con-
sidering the pros and cons of calling upon a lady
lately returned from England, whose husband had
not behaved very prettily during his grass-
widowerhood You will scarce credit it, dear, but
it took three mortal hours for these jury women
to decide whether they should visit or ostracise
this lady from their virtuous society, and what,
think you, settled the matter in her favour? I
happened to casually remark that the fortune the
lady had been home to claim was very consider-
able-much more, in fact, than she herself had
any idea of. “ Why on earth didn’t you tell us
that before, child ?” exclaimed one of these ladies,
and forthwith this much discussed lady, who is
unfortunate enough to possess an erring husband,
was pronounced “ Not guilty,” and bids fair to be
one of our society pets. Oh, hollow I hollow I
hollow I or, rather, money I money! money!
You remember my telling you some months ago
about the decision of the directors of a certain
bank here not to allow their clerks to marry if
their salaries should be under £3OO per annum ?
Well, 1 don t know, after all, that there wasn’t
wisdom in this rule, but I thlna these same direc-
tors have gone a little too far when they nave fur-
ther ruled that no clerk shall absent himself from
his duties under plea of illness unless ho presents
a doctor s certificate, and not onty that, but unless
that certificate is procured irom a certain
phjsician chosen by tne directors it shall be null
and void! Now, I think it is dreadfully hard to
compel a poor clerk to hire the services of a
doctor whose terms are of the highest, and in
whose skill, perhaps, he nas less faith than n that
of his own special medico. I wonaer it the direc-
tors get a commission from this doctor of their
own choosing! Shouldn't be at all surprised if they
do. This seems to me to be very atom shoit of
Russian despotism, and if I were a bank clerk, I’m
sure I’d “ striae ”at once. Poor fellows! there
will be no more staying at home now for an im-
aginary toothache any day they feel inclined for
a harbour trip. Not that 1 approve of their feign-
ing indisposition in order to get a holiday, not a
bit of it; for I hold that when a man undertakes
to devote a certain amount of time each day to
his work for a certain amount of remuneration
he should do it, coute qu il coute, but I do think
the directors might have been a little moro delicate
in their method of making honest men of their
employees, don’t you ?
I read in a paper the other day that “nothing
but pure politeness induces a baidbeaded man to
lift his hat on meeting a lady in the street.” This
reminds me that not long ago I went to a wedding,
and the bridegroom, who had long since said good-
bye to his fifties, was completely nald. But what
had the cunning rogue done but chosen for his
best man a youth who was also bald—prematurely
so, of course. Under ordinary circumstances,
people, upon seeing a bald-headed man marry a
young girl, would have said, “Here’s a decided case
of May and December.” But they couldn tsay the
best man was December, seeing that he was bald
yet young, so if he might be May, so might the
bridegroom. This was evidently the line of
reasoning adopted by the festive old boy who had
got a bald-headed best man to keep him in coun-
tenance. However, it isn t every man who, like
this bridegroom and his friend, wear their coun-
tenances on the top of their heads—are two-faced,
as it were.
Really, dear, I think that we of the weaker sex
are profoundly stupid in some things. Now, for
instance, when we go a long train journey we see
the men haul out their comfortable woollen,
velvet, or silk travelling caps, in favour of whicn
they, tor the time being, discard the stiff felts or
hideous stove-pipe hats, and, wild, they are—at all
events, about their heads—as cosy as you please.
We look on and envy them their ease, but it never
seems to enter our silly heads that we, too, could
do likewise, and still look as charming as in our
high, uncomfortable straw head-gear, which is not
only put out of shape by leaning against anything
leanaole, but the weight of which is bound to give
a headache. But, at last, some lady of note, with
an extra amount of common-sense, has set the
fashion of wearing travelling caps; the favourites
are made jockey shape, and the Princess of Wales
has hers made of checked silk I saw the jauntiest
little beauty yesterday made fez shape of crim-
son velvet. Just imagine the amount of conquests
a pretty girl could make during a long journey
with the aid of such a otpl
I am told that Mrs. Armstrong, the lady for
whoso benefit the charming concert was given in
the Masonic Hall last Friday night, has decided
upon going to Europe to study for the operatic
stage. Young, pretty, and possessed of a delight-
ful voice, she can hardly fail to be successful-
provided, of course, she is not devoid of acting
talent; but I should think it must need a nerve of
iron to leave ones nearest and dearest, even for so
ambitious a cause Between you and me, deaf, I
don’t believe husbands relish the idea of their
pretty wives going on to the stage, but although
I appreciate their scruples to a certain extent,
still, at the same time, I fancy that, if I were a
man and had a pretty and clever wife, I shouldn’t
be 111-pleased to know teat because of her talent
and beauty she was more popular with the world
than one woman out of a thousand, and that land
I only was the envied possessor of the jewel. Be-
side s whi:h I don't think it is right for anybody to
hide bis or her talent under a;bushel. What sort of a
place would the world be to Jive In if clever fo.k
didn’t give us all the benefit of their different en-
dowments ? Uninteresting, Indeed. What say
you, ma cherie ?
, I overheard a French gentleman make the re-
mark that if Sydney were a little bit more wicked
it would be a much more attractive place to live
in. But, indeed, I think it is becoming more
charmingly wicked every day, for besides the
various tunday concerts we have two Sunday
papers now, and I should not wonder if, before
very long, we should have the theatres
opened on that much-abused day—for it is
aoused when people Insist upon making
martyrs of themselves by having everything
around them intensely slow, and being altogether
depressed and miserable. Oh, I assure you, I find
the Sydney Sundays much improved. And, talk-
ing of the Sunday papers, I saw such a funny little
sentence in one of the social paves. It said, “Lady
Carington is very fond of washing dresses.” I
thought it a queer hobby for a lady whose time
must be precious, and began to wonder if her
pretty fingers got very much crinkled in the pro-
cess of washing dresses, when it suddenly dawned
upon me that the writer must have intended to
say the lady was fond of wearing washing dresses.
But now, dear, this means that I am very tired,
and if Igo on much longer I shall say something
equally as grotesque as the above, so I had better
at once subscribe myself,
Yours, as ever,
MAB.
BY FLOOD AND FIELD.
The principal feature about the rowing
racas at the Sydney National Regatta on Anniver-
sary day was the success of the Mercantile Row-
ing Ciuo, which carried off every amateur race on
the card, with the exception of juniors in out-
riggers. for which tney had no entry. Messrs.
Saale, Pickering, Brett, and Robertson won the
senior fours from Sydney and Balmain Rowing
Club crews by any number of lengths, and Mr.
Robertson stroked them in such fine form that
inclusion in the Intercolonial eight may be
looked upon as a certainty, if form and
performance go for anything in the nicking, G.
Ruwold was the only sculler to finish for the
junior scullers' race in outriggers. The M R.C.
crew—T. Bates, W. C. Freeman, W. Charles, and
8. A. Kemp—figured on the card for both the
maiden and junior fours, but at the last moment
Stobo took Freeman’s seat, and the crew finished
first for the double, but they were disqualified for
fouling the Sydneys in the juniors’ event, and the
race was awarded to the Balmains. Messrs. Brett,
Tompson, and Middleton put in an appear-
ance for the Laidley sculls in outriggers,
and the trio finished in the order named.
Brett rounded Goat Island first, and, row-
ing leisurely, drew out a commanding lead
tilt nearing Fort Denison, when a steamers
wash nearly swamped him, but getting underway
again, ho defeated Tompson by a couple of lengths.
The last amateur race, the maiden double sculls,
fell a victory to R. E. Brindley and L E. Taylor,
of the M.R C, who rowed the celebrated club
skiff. The manual labour double sculls fell to
M'Clerkson and Plunkett; and of the professional
races, young Charley Matterson won the all-
comers in outriggers, and the light skiff handicap
was won byP. Kemp (401b5.). Kemp had a big
lead in the outrigger race at Fort Denison, when
he came to griei, and left the youngster in com-
mand. Waiting! (timin.), Magic (scratch), Sirocco
(llmln.) and Electra (7mln.) started for the yacht
handicap, 10 tons and upwards, the winner turning
up in the Waitangi, which finished behind
the Magic. Yachts, under 10 tons, was carried off
by the Assegai, from scratch; Thomas Punch won
the canvasser race; Sophia, the Kite, dingies; Mari-
tana, the Sift, naif-deckers handicap; and Dream-
land won the 31-footers race-her only opponent,
our old love, tne Carlotta, carrying away shortly
after the start. “ Carington ” paid the flagship a
Hying visit in the morning, and all passed off
happy as the proverbial marriage bell, until
about 1 o’clock, when ah;-avy thunder and rain
storm drove the sightseers to a hasty shelter.
. * * *
Tempo again proved her quality at the
Band wick Anniversary Meeting by landing the
Handicap tor her owner and a heap of money lor
her backers. Minerva did another second, a place
for which she seems to have as great a liking as had
Mr. Tait's Strathearn or old Colima in days of
yore. Kathleen was third, so that it was evidently
a day out for the ladies. Brigantine ran home in
front for the Flying Handicap, and Cymbal tor
the Hurdle, while the Sailing Race and January
Stakes fell to Ellington and General Gordon re-
spectively. The meet was not improved by the
occasional showers.
• ■ •
As we write, the Intercolonial cricket
match is still undecided. Baokers of the Vic-
torians laid as much as 5 to 1 on their men when
the wlcke’S were Pitched, but saw the match
reduced to a 3 to 1 chance by Saturday even-
ing. and Monday’s play reduced tbe odds still
more, while Tuesday’s work turned the game
considerably, thanks to Jones and B mnor. The
latter, so far, seems the hero of the event, and
Moses, who was evidently not “out for an Aaron ”
on Saturday, is entitled to all sorts of credit for his
plucky display. The N.S.W. captain has shown
perhaps better form in this match than in any of
his former displays, and Evans, the tdol of the
terrmes, retains all his old cunning with the bill.
Th* Victorians have been generally good rather
than specially distinguished. On the first day
their fielding was disfigured by all-round careless-
ness. but their opponents cannot gird at them
much on that account.
* * *
A correspondent to one of the Sydney
dailies describes John L. Sullivan as a poor lighter,
a coward, and blackguard. This man would pro-
bably crawl up the sleeve of his own coat if he
heard the Boston boy was within five counties of
him, and own up to the lie by telegram. We have
before us a letter from Jem Mace, in which Sulli-
van is judged to be the best man In the world.
“ He is,” says Mace, “ as active as any eight-stone
man in the world. He can jump nine feet and hit
a man and get back before the other fellow fires
at him. He hits like a steam hammer driven by a
lightning flash, and there is no man ia the world
his equal. He drinks hard, but gets sober mostly
by night. After a big boosa he takes a pint of cod
liver oil with a nobbier of gin In it; then turns in
and loads himself with blankets. Ia two hours
the drink Is all on the outside of him, and a cold
bath puts him as right as rain.” To say that Sul-
livan is a coward is foolishness. He has never so
far had any reason to prove his courage, and it is
just within the bounds of possibility that he may
never be called upon to do so till dissipation has
wrecked him. Then the little children will be able
to whip him.

The chief item in Foley’s bill, at his hall,
in Sydney, on Saturday evening, was the wrest-
ling match between Connors, the Launceston
champion, and Mr. Martin Bruin, the mixed style
collarer. Mr. Bruin is a bear. To vary the enter-
tainment, some good boxing was indulged in, and
three rattling sets-to were witnessed by a splendid
house. Young Lawson and Dunn (of Newcastle)
fought a raking give-and-take battle, which was
terminated rather suddenly by Dunn cannoning
on the light weight’s head. Tne result was a
damaged eye and a marked temple. Dunn was
forced to retire- He could make a decent fight
with Lawson if he were thoroughly well. M'Kenna
and a friend nut through a lively four-rounds
rally without much damage to either side. Yeung
Mulholland, who spars very prettily, treated nis
opponent to a few minutes’ rough-and-tumble
fun. He dropped him three limes with the same
hit, and both men retired satisfied. There
1s no such satisfying thing as boxing, even
the losing man is satisfied. He receives the
delicate attentions of his opponent perhaps depre-
catingiy, and the giver being more blessed and
less punished than the receiver retires to his
corner wit h the thoroughly benevolent air of a man
who has just signed his name to a petiiion for bet-
ter drainage in the South Ward, The spar most
anxiously watched was the turn up between Mick
Dooley and young Sullivan. The latter fought a
very good eight rounds’ battle with Dooley re-
cently, and a rattling sot-to was anticloated,
Dooley, ho wever, led from the jump, and got on
Sullivan when he liked, ringing the knocker on his
nasal protuberance every time. The battle was
very one-sided, and Dooley won as he liked.
When Connors stripped and faced the bear it was
evident the fun would be varied. This contest
was a match in which the bear was backed by
Foley to throw the man three times before the
human animal felled his hirsute antagonist once.
The French gentlemen who engineers the bears had
a bet on the issue of the combat, and when Con-
nors fought for a hind-leg hold he claimed
a foul. The burly “ Lanky ” held on
however, and getting a sort of hind leg arm lock
on pitched seven hundredweight of bear's grease
fairly over. Bruin was dissatisfied and came on
again, but Connors, having thrown him, climbed
one of the uprights. The audience left the hall
with remarkable energy, and we, too, though not
frightened of the animal, recollecting an appoint-
ment up town, skipped lightly and airily from the
; scene. The bears are muzzled and their claws
blunted, but before we strip to try a fall with
either of them we shall interview him with a Mar-
tini-Henry. Cansdell and Foley knocked each
other about with single-sticks, and the uupils per-
formed some gymnastic feats at intervals during
the evening. The hall was well filled with an
athletic, muscular crowd of orderly onlookers.

Unlimited dust, very limited creature
comforts, and execrable starting, did not add
much to the success of the sixth meeting of the
Rose Hill Racing Club on Saturday last. Mr.
Gannon is not improving with the flag and the
general opinion amongst tne racing public appears
to be that a change is wanted. No less than 35
minutes were cut to waste before a straggling
start was effected for the Flying Handicap, and it
certainly seemed hard lines for the majority of
the bakers dozen of jockeys who were hum-
bugged on the pott for over half an hour and then
fined in sums ranging from £lO to a fiver. Hector
started at 5 to 3 for the Hurdle Race, but he
could only manage to run into a place, the
winner turning up in The Drummer, who de-
feated Tne Fish by a length. Recruit was
supported for the Plying Handicap at 3 to 1, and
won easily by a length from Morceau, Keith run-
ning into a place Sorata was left on the post for
the Two-Year-Old Handicap, and General Gordon
led his field till within a hundred yards or so of
home, when Colley, on Crossfire, came with a
rush, and defeated the General by a neck, Helen
Macgregor third. Falcon and Rebus ran a dead
heat for theSeling Race, and Chieftain finished
uothe day's sport by winning the Cumberland
Handicap from Rosebud.

The number of easy catches missed on
Saturday last would have disgraced a second
eleven match. Australians are falling off terribly
in their fielding, at one time their strongest point.

At the celebrated “interview” “King
Phil” told the Echo man, amongst other things,
that “ they wish to make the Association Ground
as popmar as possible.” This Is not bad, consider-
ing that the trustees have quarrelled with the
Highlanders, run the ’cyclists off the ground, and
now they are at loggerheads with the Melbourne
Club. The revenue is larger than the trustees can
well expend on the ground, and there is a rumour
—we give it for what it is worth—that it has been
mooted to take down the present complete stand,
and erect a larger structure in order to make room
for the proposed billiard-tables. The Sydney
Association is perhaps the most complete ground
of its kind in the world, and as the trustees say
they have the good of the sport at heart, they
might well expend the revenue, beyond keeping
the ground in good order, in the formation of a
new ground near the metropolis. Further expen-
diture on the Moore Park ground is pure waste.

The race for Commodore Dietrich’s trophy
for open boats 30ft and upwards, with cruising
mainsail and jib, came off on Saturday last and re-
sulted in a win for the old 21-footer, Sea Breeze.
The entries and handicaps were Pomona, 30ft,
J. M. Fxrth, scratch; Regina, 20ft, C. Q. Cameron,
2mln ; Sea Breeze, 24ft., F. Rae, Bmin. The
Pomona finished first 3min 30sec. ahead of the Sea
Breeze, which won by time allowance with minutes
to the good. The Breeze is a grand old boat, and
sails like a witch in a sea. Sne was built to the
order of Mr. Alexander Oliver—we wouldn’t
like to say how many years ago—by Barnet, but
she will be a boat when many of the latter-day
clippers will be sheer hulks. Her greatest achieve-
ment was her celebrated race against the King-
fisher round a off Barranjuey and back. It
was a lovely morning when the boats started
away, but later on it came to blow a perfect
terror from the southward. The ’Fisher took
refuge in Broken Bay, but the Breeze, with New-
ton at the tiller, if we remember aright, thrashed
back like a duck, and landed the dollars. She is
not a flyer, but with pleasure suits, and an eight-
minutts’ handicap, she had a “throw-in” on
Saturday last.

Young Cavill’s challenge to swim W. F.

states he is willing to swim CaviJi 1000yds. in
Robinson’s or Foley's baths for £25 or £5O aside.
Young Cavlll’s challenge was for a mile, but we
do not suppose he will “ Cavili ” over the altera-
tion of distance, so the aqueous cracks are pretty
sure to meet.

Says the Australasian “ A strong four

tentlon of sending them to compete In the Senior
Four at the Hobart Regatta, on the 38th January,
and in the Ladies’ Purse at the Tamar Regatta, on
the 9th February. In the event of the dates suit-
ing, they will visit Melbourne, and row in some of
the senior or challenge races.” While the Tas-
manians are “ on the job,” would it not be a good
idea for the N-S.W. Rowing Association to get up
a day’s sport on the Parramatta, and include in the
programme a four-oar race onen to all amateurs,
givinsr a prize worth going for, on condition of
the Tasmanians putting in an appearance. The
steamer money would pay expenses and leave &

Professor Miller is back in Melbourne
from that Adelaide expedition with Donald Dinnle
which brought the indignation of the natives upon
the head of the braw Scot. The Professor looks
more massively imposing than ever. Whistler’s
unsuccessful bout with the rum bottle has left the
Melbourne pet once again a Gueco-Roman cham-
pion. We believe he Is devoting weary nights
and days to mastering the details of that “ arm
lock” which the dead Kansas demon put on with
such terrible effect. The question is, where does
he find the subjects to practise upon? But.
there, you can hire men nowadays willing
to submit to a good deal in the cause
of science. Take the fellows who simulate sur-
gical cases at the medical exams, for Instance.
We remember a fellow who worked in this line for
one of the London hospitals. An aspiring student
was desired by the examiners to treat the case for
broken arm, smashed leg, and fractured ribr.
There was such a fearful lot of bandaging and
supposi'itious “setting” and tomfoolery about this
job that the case “struck” in disgust. “Look
’ere, yer!” said the case, "do you think I’m
going to stand all this pulling about for a bon
a day?” A shilling per diem was evidently the
recognised wages for allowing an embryo saw-
bones to take liberties with one’s limbs.

There was a fiendish grin on the faces of

dren may at least escape the snare of the fowler.

Or have you, gorgeous gentlemen,
Of money weary grown.
And thought it well, that for a spell,
The mugs should “hold their own”?
Keep striking, gen’rous gentlemen,
Your little volumes close,
And we shall be, henceforward, free
Prom many little woes;
Be resolute, good gentlemen,
And seek no more to lay
One-half the odds; then, oh, ye gods!
Our tailors we will pay.
For there are strikes, good gentlemen*
That no one can condemn;
Excuse our wink—we really think
That this is one of them.
Keep virtuous, good gentlemen,
All evil courses shun.
And. in that case, the human race
Will bless you, everyone.

The horse Sir Modred imported to this
colony by the railway contractor, Mr. Proudfoot,
and subsequently sold to be shipped to America,
will probably furnish the courts with some inter-

nearly 13 months the case of Proudfoot v Stubbles

stay of proceedings have prevented its being heard.
The Pull Court having now decided in Mr. Proud-
foot’s favour, all his cases will be beard as against
the Bank of New Zealand. The scratching of Sir
Modred in the Hawkesbury is not yet forgotten
by his backers, and the legal maze of uncertain
ownership which surrounded the horse had proba-

HEALTH WITHOUT MEDICINE.
Is obtained speedily and permanently by adopting
the safe and never-falling remedy of the new mode
of treatment by Electricity, as to the
human system by wearing the MAGNETiCAL
ELECTf*IC APPLIANCE CO.’S genuine ELEC-
TRIC BELT, a restorer of impaired vitality and
tailing health. It is an unvarying success In the
cure and alleviation of Rheumatism, Indigestion,
Lumbago, Sciatica, Paralysis, Epilepsy, Constipa-
tion, Nervous Debility, and the numerous ailments
consequent upon living in a semi-tropical climate,
and the baneful effects of malaria, which alone
are caused by the deficiency or abstraction from
the body of the all-pervading element of llfe-
eleotrieity. This mode of treatment is by far the
most perfect and successful method yet discovered
(combined with perfect safety) for supplying to the
bodv the continuous or imperceptible current of
electricity, without the aid of chain bands or use ,
of acid, thus giving no inconvenience to the
wearer. They are charged ready for use, and re-
tain their full power for a considerable period.
But to avoid any disappointment by their possible
loss of electric power, and to keep the appliances
up to their original strength, we undertake to re-
charge any of our appliances at the expiration of
twelve months, free of cost. One of the special
features of this treatment is the electric corset,
which is unsurpassed by its curative properties in
all female complaints, and is of superior shape and
manufacture. Price, 10s. and 15s.
GENT’S ELECTRIC BELTS are manufactured
expressly for tropical climates, of superior mate-
rial. in the shape of a riding belt, and are very
durable. Price, 155.; special power, 30s. In order-
ing size of waist outside first garment is required.
If mailed. 2s. extra. Lung Invlgorators for the
successful treatment of all lung’ complaints,
hitherto without the domain of Electric Agency,
price 30s. All who have a tendency to weak lungs
should adopt this treatment before it is too late.
The appliances are adapted for local as well as con-
stitutional treatment in the form of Knee Caps,
Vs. 6d. each ; Spine Bands, 10«. Insoles—which are
invaluable for cold feet, defective circulation,
rheumatism—4s. 6d. penpair. Send size of boot,
or paper pattern of inside ; postage, Is. 6d. extra.
The public are warned against worthless imita-
tions of our goods, as the great success attending
the adoption of this mode of treatment has in-
duced other people to attempt, by so-called cau-
tions and notices, to mislead the public. Therefore

A lady at Mt. Barker (8. A.) is said to have
been blood-poisoned by the smell of a dead black
snake, or at least that Is how we sum up the tele-
gram. She was closely examining his dead snake-
-8h —[Leave that word to the country Press— Ed.
B ] when she noticed an immense smell, and soon
after an ulcer formed on her lip, for which the
doctor prescribed snake-poison remedies. How
she was inoculated, unless she kissed the corpse,
we are unable to understand. That might have
happened; some girls would kiss anything—even a
Nooze reporter or a C.M.G.

Mother (who has just polished the broom-
handle on Johnny, seeks to inculcate a moral les-
son) : “Now, tell me why I punished you?
“That’s it,” sobs Johnny, “you nearly pound the
life out of me, and now you don’t even know why
you did it.” A recsntly-married Melbourne lady
Is not very well posted in household matters. She
recently interviewed her grocer in this style: 'I
bought three or four hams here a couple of
months ago, and they were very fine. Have you
got any more of them ? ” Grocer: “ Yes, ma’am,
there are 10 of those hams hanging up there.
“Are you sure they are off the same pig ? * 1 ee,
ma’am.” “Then i’Ji take three of them.”
Senator MoCreery. of Kentucky (U.S.), was once
puzzled by the letters E P. in the corner of a visit-
ng card, left during his absence, and took an
early opportunity of asking their meaning, when
the dude explained that they were the initials of
en versonne, to show that the owner had left it
himself. Boon after, the dude was surprised to re-
ceive the senator’s card, bearing the initials
S B A N.. and called to have them interpreted.
“Oh,” said MoCreery, “you called in person, so
marked your card E.P., mine was ‘sent by a
nigger,’ so X initialled it S.B.A N.” That dude
gave up marking pasteboards for t he senator after
this explanation “Don’t be a fool, my dear,”
remonstrated a husband to his wife, who
was letting her jaw swing loose in the breeze.
“ I won’t Mr. Jenkins, I won’t,” she answered
“people wouldn’t know us apart if I did.”.. A Ger-

Not Beauty’s Fower.
[FOR THE BULLETIN.]
Once I thought I was cold and proof
Against their wiles.
And could see the trace of the cloven hoof
In a woman’s smiles.
Women were pretty to me sometimes,
Though full of freak;
To be won by gifts, or sighs, or rhymes—
They were so weak 1
So frail, I marvelled they kept within
The rightful path,
The straying from which brings growth of sin
As an aftermath.
They had no sml to do deeds of might.
No heart to dare; . _ , .
Theirs not the strength with the world to fight—
They were only fair.
’Twas I was blind—not they so weak
As I used to think
When I rhymed a face or praised a cheek
For its tender pink.
For now I glow at the lightest touch
O f a mere dead glove;
It seems so strange I can feel so much,
But she was— my Love.
The veriest beauty that tempts a kiss
An hour may kill; _
But a glamour that comes from the grave, I wis.
Is around me still.
What is it that many a fair face gleams
And lips are red,
To one whose whole soul only dreams
Of a woman dead ?
Redfern, 17th January, 1886.

The Age was “ got at” two years ago by a
fellow named Bryant, who stuck it for £6O for in
formation, not received, about Russia’s intentions
against us. A great laugh was raised at the
“ people s paper ” being so done. We were not
prepared, therefore, to find that Mr. Service has
heen similarly taken in. At one of his Richmond
election meetings, we find such a respectable
authority as Mr. Bosisto telling the electors that
the Service and Berry Coalition Government had
paid no less than £4OO to a Melbourne-resident
Pole, named Krakowski, for information as to
Russian intentions. Someone rightly enough sang
out “flummery” at this period of the speech
whereupon Mr. Bosisto said that he had seen the
documents on which the money had heen paid.
Very likely! Bryant quite as readily produced
documents, and was rewarded with two years in
quod instead of £4OO in cash.
The Sydney Sunday Times states that the
£lOO Sheffield Handicap is to bo run on a prepared
" crack” on the new show ground. This depar-
ture will be welcomed by those athletes who boast
at midnight that they can walk a chalk hne. The
entrance fee is 10s. We have o 1 ten run onto an
unexpected crack for less money. The crack was

A SCRIPTURAL PAINTER.
The great Russian painter, Vereschagen, recently
exhibited a number of realistic pictures on Scrip-
tural subjects, at Vienna. The exhibition at first
attracted people of all classes who could afford
to pay for admission, and none were scandalised.
But suddenly the R C. Archbishop of Vienna de-
nounced the collection ss blasphemous, and
straightway the quondam admirers of the pictures,
critics, painters, courtiers, and professional men
began to apologise for having visited the exhi-
bition, and some soon wrote to the papers to say
that they did not mean, by so doing, to encourage
the painter. This little episode shows plainly
that Sydney, N.S.W., is not the only place in the
world where cowardly lickspittles crawl in the
gutters of moral debasement in search of “re-
spectability” and C.M.G.-ships. Vereschagen
shifted his quarters to Paris, where a correspon-
dent of the P. M. Gazette interviewed him. It is
to that enterprising journal that we are
indebted for what follows, and for the rough
sketches which serve to illustrate the talk.
Vereschagen’s paintings seem to express, in fact, a
revolt of a healthy mind against the ghastly abor-
tion of the Renaissance period when Art was
slave to the priestly caste. It was not at all
necessary, Vereschagen thought, to buttress up the
philosophy of Christ with accounts of childish
miracles adapted from the Greek and Latin my-
thologies. The Russian painter thought Camille
Desmoulin’s saying, that Jesus was the first sans
culotte, a true one, and one which, if well under-
stood, would advance the spread of Christian
morality. He regards Christ as pauvre diable in his
life, who was the friend of those who were as
poverty-stricken as himself. This religious genius
was developed by harsh circumstances acting on
sensitive nerves. Vereschagen therefore depicted
him in the midst of a Jewish carpenter’s family,
sitting on the steps by which the sleeping-place on
the roof is ascended to. He is poorly dressed in a
frock-like garment, and pores over a leather scroll
on which there are sacred writings. The family
of the carpenter are all in a high-walled court, on
which the crude white light of a Syrian afternoon
beats down. Joseph, with his back turned to the
spectators, works with his second son on a bench.
The mother is seated on the ground, a white cloth
sheltering her head from the sun’s rays. She
nurses a baby, and older babes gather round her
as if they were beginning to feel hungry, and
wanted her to provide for them the midday meal.
THE HOLY FAMILY.
Mary is “the mammy of the little folks,” says
Vereschagen, and “Why should she not be ?” I
asked if he thought the Lady of Grace of the
Catholics had not sprung out of the brains of pos-
tulant knights in the Middle Ages, when watching
n churchyard beside their armours. “Rather,’’
answered the painter, “out of the brains of
monks, who were ha unted by the idea of woman-
hood, and thought sanctity lay in absolute chas-
tity. They could not deny Mary’s motherhood,
but they minimized it and gave it a miraculous
character. In my opinion, she is more admirable
in the midst of a poor family, brought up to earn
their bread by the work of their hands, than as
»he is represented by the Italian painters and in
the statues of her in Lady Chapels.” “The p'c-
ture of the Resurrection.” said Vereschagen,
“ also scandalised the Archbishop, and the sheep
of Panurge who accept him as their shepherd.
Hero it is. This is the exact drawing of
a sepulchre of a rich man near Jerusalem. A
grotto in the hillside—which may, or may not, be
THE RESURRECTION.
natural—is faced with masonry. A square hole is
left near the ground large enough for a man to
crawl in on all fours, and to admit of his dragging
in a dead body when he turns round inside. A
stone is hewn to fit well into this orifice and close
it up. It is pushed to fr m without, and could be
pushed out from within by a supposed corpse who
had revived. The entombment in the sepulchre
of Joseph of Arimathea took place on the eve of
a holiday. Everyone was in a hurry. The stone
was carelessly adjusted, and there was no diffi-
culty in thrusting it back from the orifice.” So
then I said, “ You don’t believe that Jesus died on
the cross?” “No. Because He rose from it, got
out of the sepulchre, and was seen by and con-
versed with His disciples. The wounds Thomas
felt prove this. No essential organ was destroyed
on the cross, and the legs were not broken.
If they had been. He could not have
risen.” I asked Vereschagen whether he
never felt remorse at trying to under-
mine the belief of simple Christians. “What,”
he asked, “ has this to do with Christianity ? Does
it interfere with the vitalizing ethics of the Ser-
mon on the Mount ? Does it prevent men from be-
hoving-that no nation can be strong and healthy
until brotherly love is the common law ? Does
cut at the root of belief in God’s providence ? It
does not. But archbishops, bishops, an t so on,
canno&*bear to be shown that Jesus «as a savs
culotU of a sublime heart and soul. They have
been trying for centuries to tone him down to
smooth gentleness—he who was so bitterly ironical,
so fiery in his indignation, so rude, so rough in his
handling the scribes, Pharisees, hypocrites, and
the money-changers of the Temple. His sympathy
with suffering drove him often into a state border-
ing on frenzy. What would people now think of a
social reformer who went and abused the Roths-
childs on the Stock Exchange ? Well, if he did
that he would be only following in the footsteps
of Christ, who 1 admit was all kindness and geni-
ality with those who were beaten to the dust or
into the mire by the corrupt civilization of his
time.”

Hair Vigor
restores, with the gloss and freshness of
youth, faded or gray hair to a natural, rich
brown color, or deep black, as may be desired.
By its use light or red hair may be darkened,
thin hair thickened, and baldness often,
though not always, cured.
It checks falling of the hair, and stimu-
lates a weak and sickly growth to vigor. It
prevents and cures scurf and dandruff, and
heals nearly every disease peculiar to the
scalp. As a Ladies’ Hair Dressing, the
Vigor is unequalled ; it contains neither oil
nor dye, renders the hair soft, glossy, and
silken in appearance, and imparts a delicate,
agreeable, and lasting perfume.
Mb. C. P. Bricher writes from Kirby, 0..
July 3, 1882 : “ Last fall my hair commenced
falling out, and in a short time jl became
nearly bald. I used part of a bottle of
Ayer’s Hair Vigor, which stopped the fall-
ing of the hair, and started a new growth. I
have now a full head of hair growing vigor-
ously, and am convinced that but for the
use of your preparation I should have been
entirely'bald.”
J. W. Bo WE iv, proprietor of the McArthur
(Ohio) Enquirer, says : “Ayer’s Hair Vigor
is a most excellent preparation for the hair.
I speak of it from my own experience. Its
use promotes the growth of new hair, and
makes it glossy and soft. The Vigor is also
a sure cure for dandruff. Not within my
knowledge has the preparation ever failed
to give entire satisfaction.”
Mb. Angus Fairbairn, leader 'of the
celebrated “Fairbairn Family” of Scottish
Vocalists, writes from Boston, Mass., Feb. 6,
1880: “Ever since my hair began to give sil-
very evidence of the change which fleeting
time procureth, I have used Ayei’s Hair
Vigor, and so have been able to maintain
an appearance of youthfulness a matter of
considerable consequence to ministers, ora-
tors, actors, and in fact every one who lives
in the eyes of the public.”
Mrs. 0. A. Prescott, writing from 18 Elm
St., Charlestown, Mass., April 14, 1882, says :
“ Two years ago about two-thirds of my hair
came off. It thinned very rapidly, and I was
fast growing bald. On using Ayer’s Hair
Vigor the falling stopped and a new growth
commenced, and in about a month my head
was completely covered with short hair. It
has continued to grow, and is now as good as
before it fell. I regularly used but one bottle
of the Vigor, but now use it occasionally as
a dressing.”
We have hundreds of similar testimonials
to the efficacy of Ayer’s Hair Vigor. It
needs but a trial to convince the most skepti-
cal of its value,

GREAT
ANNOYANCE
has been caused
to all people using
tooth brushes by the
bristles coming out in
the mouth. The Pall
Mall Electric Associ-
ation now take pleasure
in introducing to the Aus-
tralian public a Tooth Brush, which they
guarantee free from this troublesome defect.
The bristles are inserted in the handle by a
patent process, which renders it simply
impossible to come out in use. In ad-
dition to this, the handle of the Brush is
made of a newly invented material perma-
nently charged with an electro-magnetic
current, which acts without any shock
immediately upon the nerves and tissues
of the teeth and gums. The act of
brushing causes this current to flow
into the nerve cells and roots of
the teeth, and, like water poured
upon a plant, it invigorates and
vitalizes every part, arresting
, decay, building up and re-
storing the natural white-
ness of the enamel and
quickly producing
healthful, rosy-
coloured gums.
The handle is strong
beautifully polished,
not affected by acids,
impervious to
moisture, and free
from that un-
pleasant musty
odour ea'

Now offer to the Aus-

Electric Hair, Beard &
Moustache Curler. It
is a handsome article, nickel-
plated, with an ebonized handle, and it
should occupy a place in the toilet of
every lady and gentleman in Australia.
By its aid, the hair, beard, or moustache
can be curled in any desired style in from
one to two minutes. For ladies, it produces
the “ Langtry Style,” the “ Patti Bang,” the
“Montague Curl,” and any other styles
desired by ladies wearing their hair in the
fashionable “loose and fluffy” mode.
Those who wear waves or other forms
of artificial hair will find this Electrio
Curler a very useful article. It docs
not break off and ruin the hair,
like the ordinary crimping pro-
cess, and in wet or hot weather
it works as quickly as in cold.
For curling the Moustache
or Beard in a moment, it
has no equal, while it is
so simple in its opera-
tion that any one of
either sex cam use it
successfully the first
time.

MR. WILKINS’ AMBITION.
AN' EPISODE IN THE LIFE OF AN AUSTRA-
LIAN MILLIONAIRE.
[BY A. B. ORIGIAL.]
Mn. Daniel Wilkins should have been a happy
and contented man. Having known poverty and
low estate In his youth and early manhood, he
should now, in hia middle age, have been able to
heartily appreciate the advantages he possessed of
vast wealth and the position of elevation it gave
mm above the majority of his species, not to men-
tion a handsome and devoted wife, still young,
and a sufficient number of Interesting children,
the eldest of whom, a boy, bad already distin-
guished himself at school, Still further considera-
tions should have conduced to Mr. Wilkins’ happi-
ness. His appetite was healthy to heartiness ;
his cpok was an artist; his liver was in perfect
condition; he had no poor relations—or at least he
acknowledged none; and his was or might have
been the proud reflection that he owed all his for-
tune to his own energies, to the superiority of
his business acumen over that of the majority of
the men he had in his money-making career came
in contact with, and to the noble organ of acquisi-
tiveness with which a generous Providence had
endowed him.
And yet Mr. Wilkins—Dan Wilkins, thi great
Australian millionaire—as he sat one morning at
II in on 6 of the gorgeously-furnished receptions
(called on account of the delicate tint of colour
which characterised it the salmon-room) of his
vast mansion in Pontif Square (London), which
had been purchased at a fabulous figure from one
of the proudest of England’s noble families, his
small but somewhat obese figure almost buried in
a luxurious arm-chair, was far from being either
a happy or contented man. On the previous even-
ing he had given a ball, which, in many respects,
had been a triumph. A large number of the
creme de la creme of society had accepted his invi-
tations for the first time. Moreover, Royalty had
graced bis saloons, and had actually remained 20
minutes by Dan’s gold repeater.
Mrs. Wilkins had played the grande dame to per-
fection, and altogether everyone but the million-
aire himself voted the occasion a complete success.
“It is unbearable,” ho muttered, gloomily.
“ After scattering my money broadcast for three
years, society has condescended to be entertained
by me. But what did they come for? To view
that outlandish animal the Australian squatter in
his lair. I heard their remarks. I heard the word
* Parvenu,’ and the exclamation ‘ and all this comes
from poor sheep’s backs, did you say ?’ How won-
derful I No, I shall never be one of them while I
am plain Daniel Wilkins. I must have a title
whatever it costs.”
At the moment Mr. Wilkins came to the conclu-
sion that a title was necessary to his happiness, the
door opened, and a tall, thin man lounged into the
room.
“ Well, Dan.,” remarked the new-comer, stretch-
ing himself lazily upon a couch, “ you are doubt-
less gloating over last night’s social triumph.”
“That I am certainly not.” answered Mr. Wil-
kins, somewhat Irritably; “I can find nothing to
gloat over.”
Mr. Edward Rolfe looked up from the couch in
great surprise. He and Dan. Wilkins had been
neighbours and chums in Australia, and, notwith-
standing that they were as different in disposition
as In appearance, the friendship between them
was so strong that Mr. Wilkins had not been long
settled in England with his “ pile ” before he wrote
begging his friend to come over and spend a year
with him, an invitation which had been readily
accepted. Mr. Wilkins desire for the companion-
ship of his old chum was, perhaps, not altogether
disinterested, for llolfe was a man of birth and
education, and having, before his voluntary exile
to the Antipodes, moved in a good set, he would
now be invaluable to the suecessful squatter as a
pilot among the shoals and quicksands of society.
Moreover, Mr. Wilkins was conscious that Rolfe
was the only disinterested friend he possessed, and
the only man who always told him the unvarnished
truth, a quality Which, although often in its exer-
cise disagreeable to the feelings, was of peculiar
value to a man in his position.
~^o th,nfir t 0 S loat over?” echoed Mr. Rolfe.
“Why, what an insatiable fellow you are! Two
Royalties, a Cabinet Minister, ten ambassadors, a
duchess, and I should be afraid to say how many
miscellaneous titles. You ought to be half dead
with happiness. Imagine what the simple folks in
Australia will say when they hear of it.”
“ They will say that Dan Wilkins may entertain
these people, but he is not one of them, and I feel
that It is true. I felt it last night, Ted; my guests
made me feel it. I heard remarks.”
“My dear Dan., how often have I told you that
you must not expect good manners—which I un-
derstand to mean a tender regard for other
people’s feelings—in the society you are at present
courting. Remarks! If you begin by noticing
remarks, you will be either in Australia or Colney
Hatch Asylum In a twelvemonth. You know
how I despise the prizes you are aiming at, but I
must say last night’s event was a great success.
Your wife was splendid.”
“And I ?” asked Mr. Wilkins, nervously.
“You? Well, you were-ahem—well enough,
considering; though rather nervous, perhaps, and
self-conscious. If you had been simply yourself
It would have been all right, but you wore not.
Excuse me saying so, buc you should not have
permitted yourself to be so overpowered when the
big wigs arrived.”
Mr. Wilkins blushed scarlet, and bit his lips pain-
fully. It was a marvel to his friend how a man
could endure such torture in the pursuit of so
worthless an ambition.
“ It would appear that I at least succeeded in
amusing my guests,” remarked Mr. Wilkins, bit-
terly, when the mental twinge had passed off.
•‘You mean, that they laughed at you. I did
not hear them, but no doubt they did,” answered
Holfe frankly. “ But what of that ? You must
go through the Mill like thousands of otners have.
Your turn to laugh will come later on. In the
meantime emulate your wife. She is quite equal to
the situation. Women always adapt themselves
to altered circumstances more readily than men.
Remember that you have far more to be proud of
than these people, for you conquered fortune for
yourself and you could buy up the majority of
them. The reflection will give you dignity, and,
pardon me, Dan, that is the thing you want.”
“Thereis something I require still more,” said
Mr. Wilkins, " and that is atitle.”
Mr. Rolfe shrugged his shoulders as expressive
of his supreme contempt for such baubles.
“And, pray, what good would that do you ? ”
“Good?” cried Mr. Wilkins;, “every good!
coupled with my wealth, it would secure me the
position, the respect, the consideration 1 require.”
“I know wise men who persistently reject such
honours,” remarked Mr. Rolfe, “ Gladstone and
Morley, for instance.”
“ I’m neither a Gladstone nor a Morley,” replied
the millionaire.
“True, very true,” murmured his cynical friend,
reflectively.
“My ambition is, I think, not an ignoble one,”
pursued Mr. Wilkins, warming with his thee, e,
“I aspire to re-found what was once a great
family. When Richard the second came to the
throne ”
“Stay!” interrupted Rolfe, in undisguised
alarm, “ for heaven’s sake, don't let us enter into
the ramifications of the genealogical tree of tne
great house of Wilkins. You bought it, and paid
tor it, like a man, and therefore you have every
right to it. I’m quite prepared to accept it as
gospel, but the subject is too full of intricacies for
my weak intellect. Let us return to the point. A
title is necessary to your happiness. Good tobacco
Is far more necessary to mine- but no matter.”
“ Look at the power it gives one!” interrupted
Mr. Wilkins, folding his arms and knitting his
brows, in the unconscious endeavour to invest
himself with the dignity of bearing becoming to
a title, “as Mr. Wilkins, lam nobody. Everyone
is not to know that I am a millionaire. 1 may be
pushed and hustled about like any ether man.
But, as Lord ”
“Fitz Wilkins,” suggested Mr. Rolfe, pleasantly.
“ Well, say Lord Fltzwilklns. 1 should be
courted, considered, and waited upon. In travel-
ling, my name upon the luggage would be suf-
ficient to secure for me the devotion of guards,
I porters, hotelkeepers, stewards, and the like. You
know, yourself, how, in the colonies, which are
naturally democratic, and even in republican
America, a Lord is worshipped.**
‘ fes. I know,” replied Mr. Rolfe, wearily, “and
the knowledge is not calculated to elevate one’s
estimation of the human race. Again, let us re-
turn to the point- You hunger for a handle to

about this matter in the right way. You are

Before Mr. Wilkins had time to consider and
y to these startling suggestions, a servant
announced that the Duchess of Middlesex and her
\ b , e Ladies Leyton, had called,
they were in the blue drawing-room.
Mr. Wilkins became agitated.
What shall 1 do, Ted”? he asked, “Alice is
driving in the park.”
wliJ 011 mu ? t see them, of course,” replied Mr.
• ... It 8 a £ rea t bore.”
Mr. Wilkins hesltatGd j ii© did not feel enual tn
fheihg the haughty Duchess alone.
.. Yt°7 ou mind coming with me, old man?”
iNot at all, if you wish it,” answered Rolfe
smiling at his friend’s panic-stricken face. ’
The two gentlemen found the Duchess and her
daughters full of amiability, Mr. Wilkins, tremb-
ling with mingled pleasure and nervousness
listened to her Grace’s congratulations on the ball!
which she declared would be remembered as one of
ff reat events of the season. She and herdaugh-
hßflf«n£ie?-10yed themselves so much that they had
hastened to pay their congratulatory visit. Mr.
"PRAISE FROM SIR HUBERT STANLEY.”
“I SAY, BILLY, SHE’S A STUNNER!”
Wilkins was rosy with gratification, which he
made an effort to express. Mr. Rolfe smilingly
ana sffentiy awaited the sequel. It came j list as
the ladies were about to leave.
™o^^ by : the ' c b^ e ’. Mr - Wilkins,” said her Grace,
with the cheerful air of one who Is about to confer
a * av ? u .r, “ I had almost forgotten. There is
a little work in which I aln sure you would like to
,>omus-I refer to ‘ The Reduced Ladies’Benefit
aod Relief Society. No doubt you have heard a
great deal of the good we have been enabled to do,
but lately we have fallen rather low in funds, and
as we Intend extending, our operations consider-
ably we have taken the advice of Mr. Dombev
and are making an effort.’ ”
“I shall be haopy to assist in such agood cause,”
declared Mr. Wilkins, ringing the bell. “My
cheque-book, James.”
As the millionaire moved to a bureau for the
purpose pt drawing a cheque, his friend en-
deavoured, unobserved by the ladles, to make a
sign to him, which consisted of stretching out his
hands, and holding them very wide apart. The
1 iT?f. e P*^ one ? signal, however, was lost upon
Mr. \\ 1 1k ms, who, after a moment’s hesitation,
wrote a cheque, blotted and folded it. and pre-
sented it with his best manner to the Duchess.
A little conversation on indifferent subjects en-
fiued, during which the three ladles retained their
amiability; out when they rose to go, it was seen
that her Graces manner had suddenly become
icy. Taking their cue as they invariably did
from their mama, the Ladles Leyton also froze.
The Duchess gave Mr. Wilkins three fingers in-
stead of four; the Lady Eva presented him with
two, and Lady Laura with one. When they had
swept from the room, Mr. Wilkins sank into a
chair, wiped his fevered brow, and looked ques-
uonlngly at his friend.
‘‘ What have you done ? ” asked the latter.
~, r can’t imagine,” gasped the millionaire—
have I commuted some dreadful solecism ? ”
‘ Certainly not. It would have been wiser to
have sent your subscription to the secretary of
the society, perhaps, instead of calling for your
cheque book, and you forgot to enclose the cheque
in an envelope before handing it to the Duchess.
But those are trivialities. I suspect it was not the
manner of receiving, but the amount of the
cheque which offended her Grace. I caught her
in the act of half opening, and glancing at it.
Pray what was the figure ? ”
‘‘Five pounds.”
Mr. Rolfe fell back in his chair with a groan,

mad. A Croesus, who wishes to bring society to

,? u exact| y bear me out in what I said just
now, responded Mr. Rolfe—“ that you fritter
your money away in driblets. Had the mendicant
been any other than the Duchess of Middlesex it
** n °t have been of so much consequence,
“utyou must surely be aware that her Grace, be-
sides being one of the acknowledged leaders of
J f^ a ? ardent and influential politician, and
that the Duke is a shining light in a great party,
winch caunot, in the natural course of events, be
much longer out of power; the party, too, to
which you have attached yourself.”
- *? n l am J ost,” groaned Mr. Wilkins, “ I had
forgotten. What’s to be done ? Shall I send her
Grace another and bigger cheque ? ”
•Most certainly not,” replied his friend
promptly, “that would be far too palpable a move.
Juft us consider. This diplomatic dead-lock is be-
coming quite interesting.”
A conversation of considerable length and
warmth ensued, in which Mr. Rolfe gave his
ambitious friend the benefit of some sound advice,
r;.® ar *f fh ft t Mr, Wilkins had not attached
himself with sufficient fervour to his political
party; at any rate, he had not given any very
substantial proof of bis attachment. That party
2u ou ii ll \, ab probability come into power very
~ that was almost as certain as that they
would not hold the keys of office longer than a
few months, or perhaps weeks. Under these cir-
cumstances, it was for Mr. AVilkins to make hay
while the sun shone. The next question was as to
the character of the hay to be made. Mr. Rolfe
strongly recommended a handsome contribution
to the election fund of the party—the general
elections were approaching—and the endowment
of a college.
Pressed by his friend as to figures, he suggested
ten thousand pounds for the former, and fifty
thousand for the endowment.
approved of everything suggested
but the figures, which almost took his breath
“way. declared that such prodigality would
ruin him. The natural Instincts of the man
asserted themselves; the principles which had
guided him to fortune were by no means dead If
you had offered to sell Mr. AVilkins a horse worth
£3O for exactly that sum, he would have endea-
voured to beat you down to £ls, He was of that
class of buyers mentioned in Holy Writ, who,
after crying- “It is nought! it is nought!” subse-
quently go their ways rejoicing.
And so he now argued and beat down Mr. Rolfe,
as though it were from that gentleman he was
purcnasing a peerage. In the end, both the
amounts suggested were cut down exactly one-
half.
In the course of the afternoon, and unfor-
tunately at a time when Mr. Rolfe with his shrewd
sense did not chance to be available, Mr. Wilkins’
cheese-paring policy again came into play. Ho
was visited by a Mr. Strongpoone, a gentleman
who, in his position as a journalist, had done good
service with his pen lor Mr. Wilkins since his
advent into London society; service for which he
had received no return-nor, indeed, had he
hitherto sought it, beyond occasional invitations
to the great man’s house. Latterly, Mr. Strong-
penne had sustained some severe losses, and he
was now temporarily in deep water. Under these
circumstances, and remembering Mr. Wilkies’
many expressions of interest and good will, he had
called to beg the loan of £3O for a few weeks.
Being a sensitive man, he made the request ner-
vously, but never doubting for a moment that it
would be readily and cheerfully complied with.
His astonishment and indignation will, therefore
be readily Imagined when Mr. Wilkins, after a
long and serious sermon on the tendency borrow-
ing had to destroy the independence of a man’s
character, to lead to ill-feeling and the severance
of friendship, and the advisability of each man
lighting his own way unaided through life, offered
to present him with £5.
Burning with mingled shame and resentment.
Mr. Strongpeane coldly declined the offer and
abruptly departed.
The fact was that Mr. Wilkins, conceiving that
the journalist could be of no further use to him,
considered that a compliance witn his request
would have been “frittering money away,” and he
was much astonished in tne evening, when he
related the Incident to Mr. Rolfe, that his conduct
was very far from gaining that gentleman’s ap-
proval. He had not the wit to see that, notwith-
standing his cynicism, Rolfe’s heart was a thousand
times larger than nis own.
In a few days Mr. Wilkins’ two splendid gifts
were known to the world, and were tne talk of
society. The £SOOO to the election fund of his
party came at a time when it was moat needed,
and the blushing litue squatter was button-holed
at the club by noble lords, who broadly hinted ot
