“Graham Kerr says
you should cook
with fflkrified
Butter?”
Clarified Butter. Pure dairy butter with the
water, salt and curd removed. Butter that
doesn’t splutter and foam when it’s melted,
that won’t catch or burn. As Graham Kerr
says, "Clarified Butter brings out the flavour
of food better than anything else I know".
And, of course, you have to use so little
Clarified Butter—just enough to cover the
bottom of the pah lightly. And you use it at
temperatures much lower than those recom-
mended for other cooking fats and oils. So
protein fibres are cooked much more gently,
food comes to the table so much more
tender. Try this recipe using Clarified
Butter (also sold as Ghee or Butter Oil,
incidentally).
Schnitzel
4 thin veal cutlets
seasoned flour
1 egg, beaten
1 tablespoon milk
dried breadcrumbs
ozs. clarified butter
4 thin slices lemon
2 hard boiled eggs, sliced
4 anchovy fillets
Method: Beat veal slices until thin.
Toss in seasoned flour, then dip in egg
and milk mixture. Dip in breadcrumbs
and press with a flat knife. Heat clarified
butter in a heavy pan. Fry the veal slowly
for 10 minutes, turning once. Serve
garnished with slices of lemon, egg and
anchovy fillets.
I Yields 4 serves.
Clarified Butter may be purchased at all the
best food stores , If you have difficulty obtain-
ing it, or would like further information and
recipes, write to The Director, Dairy Foods
Services, Australian Dairy Produce Board,

NATURE S FINEST
BATMAN’S
MELBOURNE
Nothing like the
good old
Carlton love-ins
IF WE ARE NOT always original in
this country, we are awfully good at
following. If there’s a new idea, cult,
or movement going, we’re amongst the
first cabs off the rank.
An invitation arrived in the mail
which read in part: “the hippie move-
ment is happening in Melbourne. Who
are the hippies? What are they? The
hippie movement started in the United
States and its mass following and meet-
ings in such places as San Francisco
and New York amazed and confused
Americans. It is the culture of the
beautiful people, the ones that think
and do pleasant things. The central
theme of the movement is LOVE.
“On Sunday the ‘love-in’ explodes
with Melbourne’s first real happening.
God alone knows what will happen.
All we know is that it will.
“Thru the doors of perception groove
with psychedelicacies like extrasensory
coffee and hungry freak food. Throb-
bing lights . . . dizzying designs . . .
swelling sounds . . . swirling scents.
Saturate your senses with color and
music, light, and motion until your
mind blows into the never-never land
of selflessness. We’d love to turn you
on. The love-in.”
Well, as you know, nothing ever
happens in Melbourne on a Sunday.
The purest of excitement is either the
swans at the Botanical Gardens or the
landing of aeroplanes out at Essendon.
At 2 p.m. on Sunday your correspon-
dent rushed immediately to Faraday St.,
Carlton, to saturate his senses with
color and get himself mind blown into
selflessness.
The establishment was called “the
Love Centre” and it was divided
into two parts, “the Print Mint” shop
and the “Door of Perception” coffee
lounge. As soon as one arrived one was
handed a flower to put in buttonhole
or hair. Most young gentlemen were
wearing the flowers in the hair. It was
an interesting start. In the good old
days a love-in, in this part of Carlton,
would have been a somewhat different
function.
Herb Caen, the San Francisco colum-
nist, once described the local hippies
as being like camels, both could go a
very long time without touching water.
At this love-in they looked like a bunch
of young innocents; one felt that if
they were confronted with a real
Haight-Ashbury hippie in full flight
on an LSD trip they’d be shocked out
of their psychedelic wits. A third of
those present were wearing battered
antique uniforms, obviously hired from
J. C. Williamson’s. One young man was
dressed as a Canadian mountie.
Perhaps the most beautiful young
man there was Tazbo Jones. He had on
a Japanese silk embroidered jacket, a
striped T-shirt, utterly correct rimless
glasses in the latest John Lennon tradi-
tion, a wispy beard, and trousers and
hat flecked with fluorescent paint de-
signed to light up in the dark. He
carried a long cane topped with a
shrunken head, and he said that when
he wasn’t being a hippie he was a
plumber.
In the restaurant there were lights
flashing on and off, there were swirling
psychedelic designs on the walls, girls
masked in black cat costumes were
dancing, and there was psychedelic
music. This actually was screeching
electronic noise all off key. Every
marvellous thing that could be done
was done to exacerbate the nerves. The
message on top of the menu read:
“WHY BE A JUNKIE? BLOW
YOUR MIND WITH THESE LOVE-
IN PSYCHEDELICACIES.”
Sandra Crowe was over from Sydney.
She said she started Australia’s first
psychedelicatessen, the Pothole, at
Paddington. What sold best at psyche-
delicatessens? Posters, jewellery, cloth-
ing, that sort of thing, she said. The
best-selling posters were pictures of Bob
Dylan and Rudolph Valentino. One
noticed also pictures of Marlon
Brando, Theda Bara, Jean Harlow,
and Mao Tse Tung. Chairman Mao
wasn’t a good seller, she said.
Also it seemed terribly important for
a true hippie to have himself a sweat
shirt. These cost $6.50 and came with
these messages printed across the chest:
MAKE LOVE NOT WAR. DRAFT
BEER NOT STUDENTS. REALITY
IS A CRUTCH. HELP STAMP OUT
REALITY. LEGALISE LSD. It was
“This is ridiculous! Nothing ever ‘hap
pens’ in Melbourne on a Sunday!”

also the gospel according to Haight-
Ashbury, San Francisco, and entirely

One pointed out that Shelley Berman
had been most bitter about the hippie.
He said he couldn’t stand non-
movements. He had no time for people
who lay about, drugged themselves,
complained of the state of the world,
and did nothing about it.
Sandra Crowe said that wasn’t the
point at all. This was a flower war, a
movement of love. The idea was to
spread the message of love and peace
all around the world. Eventually it
had to take effect. One only hoped she
was right. Incense sticks were on sale
for four cents and these were so new
everybody had to have one. The place
stank like a temple on Buddha’s birth-
day.
But there’s another interesting angle
to the hippie movement. Those of us
who have long since left the RSL are
desperately sorry that we stuffed our
old uniforms in the church rag bag.
They are fetching excellent prices at
all the Army disposal stores. The hip-
pies’ ideal is the uniform of the French
Hussars, Prussian Grenadiers, or the
British 17th Regiment of Foot, but
these times you can only get them
through theatrical agencies. Mitchell’s
Army and Navy Stores, in Melbourne,
say that the most sought-after there
are the old Navy uniforms with the
gold buttons. These fetch $l3 each.
Then those formal Army mess jackets
are good, and the red jackets worn by
mess stewards sell awfully well. Natur-
ally, the female of the species does not
go in for such bright plumage, so,
according to Mitchell’s, girls go for
Aertex-type Army safari jackets, and
they simply cannot get enough of them.
Several weeks back the GPO in Mel-
bourne put on a centenary display,
which included red-jacketed postal uni-
forms. These were stolen by the hippies
on the first day. So, you see, any
uniforms will do. Last week there was
a gentleman walking down Bourke St.
He was wearing a uniform that could
be best described as a cross between
the Hotel Australia and the Windsor,
with just a touch of the Regent Theatre.
On his chest he was wearing an Iron
Cross.
Sandra Crowe says a genuine Iron
Cross on the hippie market is now worth
$2O. A good facsimile will fetch $lO,
and a rough cast affair $4. The Iron
Cross is the IN medal to wear; a
KCMG is not nearly as good. How-
ever, Mitchell’s say they can sell any
medals, any medals at all. Even a medal
like the contralto’s gold medal for the
Heidelberg Eisteddfod, 1899, they’ll
buy, as long as it looks good on a chest.
Old fur coats, frock coats, antique
evening suits, all these are good for
the hippies. But uniforms are best and
that’s the sweet irony of this thing.
The fellow that would walk to Darwin
on his knees rather than register for
National Service loves to get out in
uniform with his Iron Cross.

When life has
few problems
THESE Aboriginal children live at
La Perouse reserve on the north side
of Sydney’s Botany Bay. The reserve
now houses about 250 people on ten
acres, acres which, one resident claims,
“were given to my grandmother,
Queen Emma, by Queen Victoria.”
Photographer Roderic Hulsbergen
found these children very much like
children he had photographed in
Italian villages. They wanted sixpence
to pose for pictures and one truculently
offered to “bust his car.”
But whatever is right or wrong
about La Perouse its days are
numbered. The N.S.W. Aborigines
Welfare Board has described Abor-
iginal reserves in cities as “incon-
gruous.” (Not, one might think, the
only incongruity in Aboriginal affairs.)
Ready or not, these children will
spend their adulthood in the open
community.

this is an effective example of nomadic

WHY DO SO MANY
YOUNG EXECUTIVES
BUY OUR CARPETS?
Successful young executives are
very astute they choose furnish-
ings that reflect both their status
and their impeccable taste and will
try to avoid the commonplace and
unimaginative wherever possible.
They have discovered how genuine
Oriental rugs add distinction and
the cachet of original art to their
decor. Because each rug is unique,
as individual as the weaver who made
it, a well-chosen example gives that
touch of inspiration to any room.
As these rugs reflect the art of the
tribal nomadic weavers and the
peasants of Western Asia as well as
of the urban mastercraftsman, there
is a type to suit every personality
and all decors.
Astute young executives know that
a good Oriental rug is an inter-
nationally accepted asset that grows
more valuable and beautiful with age
and use.

Guess which
one is wearing
the Tony
By DAPHNE GUINNESS
HAIRPIECES WITH a built-in ouch!
Custom-made from genuine human
hair. Guaranteed undetectable. Go on,
pull it. Of course it hurts. It’s stuck
on, see, with Sir’s Plas-Skin, all over
the lace base, removable only with Sir’s
secret formula in a little glass bottle,
so don’t run out of that.
It takes two years for a man to step
through this glass door and into Sir’s
intimate masculine waiting-room on
the first floor of Wynyard House in
George Street, Sydney. There are green
tweedy chairs and pine walls and pine
fresh air, and on one wall hangs a pic-
ture of a bare-breasted Filipino girl
painted on black velvet. And through
the pine air comes piped music, at this
moment relaying “What Have You
Done To My Heart,” and Brian Austin
the man behind hairpieces for men
among other things says it’s all
intentional, if they’d built a palatial
place in a posh part of Sydney it
would frighten them away.
Mr. Austin’s arrival, after a pro-
longed wait, is slightly pressured. His
two consultants, in bright red jackets
with “Sir’s” monogrammed in gold on
the pockets, leap to their feet and turn
instant formal. One is 22 and has been
“in hair” since 16. The other is —•
“well, guess how old I am?” he says,
“what do you think, eh?” and “does it
look as if I’m wearing a hairpiece?”
the trained reply to the stock question
everyone asks in this place this
consultant sold cars before he came
into hairpieces.
Mr. Austin wears a Madison Avenue
mousse-brown suit and pink giraffe-
collared shirt and his nails are varnished
in that acceptable New York manner.
He is 32 and has see-through curly hair
which could be his own “what do
you think, does it look like a hair-
piece?” and talks with a fast Ameri-
can accent.
“Sure they laughed when we opened
here four years ago, you know, wigs
for men, and in Australia, but we reckon
now one in five bald men wears a
hairpiece, it’s one in two in America,
and business is booming. I’ll say it is,
last year he had 15 new people a week,
this year it’s 30. We get all kinds of
men here, a high proportion are doc-
tors, yes, doctors, and we have a bank
manager who told his staff he’d bought
a hairpiece and they’d got to give it a
chance, and road-diggers, laborers, not
just entertainers. We’ve got a Govern-
ment Minister who wears one over-
seas and leaves it off in Australia, good
lord, I can’t tell you who, everything’s
strictly confidential, locked up, not even
the cleaners can get at it.
What Brian Austin wants to achieve
is the sort of situation that exists now
in fashion wigs for women. He envisa-
ges men changing hairstyles as' and
when they feel like it, color, too, if
they want, and being perfectly honest
about it. At the moment the man who
invests in a hairpiece costing on aver-
age $3OO half down, balance on
receipt does so usually before a
vacation so that his return with a
magnificent growth of hair. is not
violently noticeable. Mr. Austin claims
that people say: “Oh, you’ve got a mar-
vellous tan,” or “goodness, you’ve lost
weight,” or “you look well”- one
client began wearing a tie and friends
said the difference it made but they
never say “aha, you’re wearing a hair-
piece,” and believe it or not, the same
is true of completely bald men.
Wives and girlfriends, well, 95 per-
cent of them, are not repelled by men
who wear hairpieces (children are, they
don’t like their dads looking different);
actually, some women come with their
men and together they thumb through
Mr. Austin’s Before-and-After photo-
graph album, which contains on the
one side pictures of gentlemen looking
perfectly wretched without hair, and on
the other side looking perfectly rap-
turous with it, and help choose a style.
There are six: Conservative, Ivy League
(long or short), Caesar Without Part,
Straight Brush Back, Pompadour Tony
Curtis, and Crew Cut. The head is
measured, sample of hair snipped off,
and a frustrating month later the hair-
piece is ready for wearing. To sleep
in, swim in, do anything they like
in. “The joy,” says Mr. Austin, “in
their eyes when they see how young
they look is fantastic.” He has seen
introverts creeping through that glass
door and five minutes after extroverts
bounding out. It does his heart good.
A consultant who earlier had paraded
in a Caesar Without Part returns, look-
ing rather ordinary, in a Conservative.
“Now,” says Mr. Austin, lighting an-
other cigarette, “would you detect that
hairpiece if you didn’t know? Be ab-
solutely honest, would you? I see. You’d
think there was something—er—odd
about his hair? Well, of course, this
wasn’t made for him, and it’s not his
proper color—”
And when a man starts aging they
pepper-and-salt his hairpiece with greys
and flecky brown, right through to white
if that’s his natural coloring. They’d
even, to make it more convincing, take
a bit out and give him a receding fore-
head and the faintest suggestion of
baldness at the back.
“Why not?” asks Mr. Austin.

SOMETHING
NEW
WITH GRAHAM KERR
Keeping them
fit down
on the farm
PEOPLE WHO EAT too much, drink
too much, work too hard, or are just
plain bored are finding their way in
increasing numbers into health farms.
I spent ten days at one of the latest
and most elaborate of these during my
recent trip overseas. This was Forest
Mere, in England. It is very fashionable,
very expensive, and very luxurious.
At that stage of my journey I had
America’s iced water and gigantic por-
tions of food behind me; Europe’s wines
and rich sauces ahead. At Forest Mere
I ate lettuce and loved it.
Forest Mere was my first experience
of a health farm. I spent several hours
talking to the principal, Mr. Norman
Sandieson, trying to uncover any
evidence of fads or fanaticism, perhaps
even a suggestion of a confidence trick.
“The human system,” Sandieson said,
“is an incredibly tough mechanism,
especially when you consider what we
do to it. We worry it, fill it with useless
food, saturate delicate organs with
alcohol, suck smoke and tar into our
lungs, keep the whole mechanism work-
ing long hours without proper rest; and,
if all that isn’t enough, we ignore it
when it protests.”
Sandieson doesn’t see why it should
be considered a “weakness” to attend a
hydro. “All the things we do that hurt
our bodies are usually called habits. The
worse the habit the harder it is to break,
especially if you try to break it in your
own environment. If you genuinely wish
to change a pattern of existence, you
can best do it by going away and paying
skilled people to help you.”
And how much does it cost to break
these bad habits? One of the directors
of Forest Mere said: “The type of
relaxation that modern life demands is
a sound investment for all who value
their health. If you stayed at a hotel
of comparable standard to Forest Mere
it would cost between £stg.6 and
£stg.lO per day, excluding all food
and with, no doubt, a service charge
of 10 to 15 percent. At Forest Mere
fees for single rooms are between £stg.6
and £stg.9 a day, and this includes all

your treatments and the facilities of
a modern physiotherapy department.”
The first step is a medical examina-
tion. With a clean bill of health, other
than drug or drink addiction or obesity,
you are led away feeling that this time
you really must take yourself in hand.
Your room is comfortable although
the decor is simple; every modern fit-
ting is provided, including television,
the only bad habit allowed.
Breakfast, such as it is, is served in
your room. Luncheon for what are
called normally adjusted patients is
buffet style in the dining-room and con-
sists of salads and fruits.
The less-slender inmates are pro-
tected from this display of wanton glut-
tony and have lunch in the Light Diet
Room, which has a beautiful view of
lawn, lake, and Canadian geese. “Oh,
for one of those geese!” moaned one
rotund gentleman, solemnly separating
segments of grapefruit.
I doubt if you could find a more
enthusiastic band of gourmets in the
world. All they talk about is the last
meal or the next one.
After the first 48 hours you experi-
ence withdrawal symptoms and feel
decidedly off-color. You convince your-
self that it is the toxic solids on their
way out. But if they are on their way
out, why don’t you feel better? You
grow more and more miserable and
decide that the man who wrote that
inspired line in Forest Mere’s pros-
pectus: “Without battle, no victory,
without self-denial, no self-satisfaction”
should be put up against a wall and
shot. At this stage the only thing which
kept me going was the no-refund clause
in my enrolment form.
The next day dawns. You have an
early-morning dip in the heated pool,
then a huge plate filled with half a
grapefruit and a glass of water. Then
there is a quick trip to the sauna, fol-
lowed by a superb massage.
What next? You glance down the free
menu of treatments: osteopathy, electro-
therapy, colonic lavage (no thanks),
remedial exercise, physiotherapy, neuro-
muscular technique, hydrotherapy. How
about the a la carte ? Rhythmic traction
(James Bond got this in the film
“Thunderball”; the sequence was shot
at Forest Mere), infra-red, ultra-sonic,
short-wave diathermy, wax baths (I sup-
pose for people who burn the candle at
both ends), or even faradism, whatever
that might be.
If you don’t see anything you fancy
there, you can go for a sail on the
lake, a ride on horseback, play golf,
croquet, or bowls.
You leave after ten days feeling a
better, fitter, more vigorous man filled
with gusto, refreshed, and determined
to get your teeth into the largest steak
and the best bottle of burgundy at the
first available restaurant.

If you want to
succeed, just
sing Elmer's tune
BY ROSS CAMPBELL
I ONCE WROTE an article in this
magazine about the Lady of Shalott,
pointing out that she was a typical
introvert, lacking in the qualities
needed to get on in life. Some readers
found the article depressing, so I would
like to make amends by saying some-
thing about a person who is the lonely
Lady of Shalott’s exact opposite. He
is an eminent American insurance sales-
man named Elmer G. Leterman. His
philosophy is crystallised in his aphor-
ism: “The man who lunches alone is
committing career suicide.”
Leterman achieved success in his
business not through any special know-
ledge of insurance but by unremitting
sociability. He demonstrated this when
he lived for a year in Hawaii in the
19305. He adopted the then-unprece-
dented practice of meeting passenger
ships and throwing leis around the
necks of total strangers. It made him
a popular local character, and helped
him to sell a lot of insurance. When
Leterman left Hawaii, 147 leis were
thrown around his neck (a record that
still stands).
Basically he is a disciple of Dale
Carnegie, who gave classic expression
to the doctrine that winning friends
helps you to make money. But Leter-
man has developed the master’s teach-
ing by showing that, to multiply friend-
ships, you should attract attention to
yourself. In his important book “How
Showmanship Sells” (Harper and Row,
New York) he cites distinguished men
who have done this. Paul J. Meyer,
now president of Success Motivation
Institute, made it his trademark to
hand out colored balloons to the child-
ren of his clients. He also became adept
in twisting the balloons into amusing
animal shapes.
Elmer G. Leterman himself attracts
attention by wearing unusual clothes.
His coats have a distinctive notch in
the lapels, known to clothing manu-
facturers as “Elmer’s notch.” He once
wore a curious pair of custom-made
shoes, costing $125, which aroused the
interest of a property developer named
A. E. Lefcourt. This led to a warm
friendship, which in turn led to a notice
on all A. E. Lefcourt buildings: “This
building is insured by Elmer G. Leter-
man.” Another Leterman stratagem
is carrying a pocket alarm watch, pre-
set to go off at a time when it will
attract maximum attention.
His book abounds in tributes to the
value of friendship. “How can I weigh
the help afforded my career by my
lifelong friends in the National Knitted
Outerwear Association?” he asks. As
evidence that it pays to help others
he quotes his friend “Smitty” Kogan,
a public-relations counsellor renowned
for philanthropic activities. “Smitty”
says: “My bread on the waters invari-
ably comes back toasted and spread
with caviar.”
For publicising himself and making
friends, Leterman relies pre-eminently
on the business lunch. He has a per-
manent table at an expensive restaurant
in New York, The Four Seasons (a
Leterman maxim is “Go first class
through life”). There he daily gathers
such notables as Donald A. Weiss,
president of Packaged Facts, Inc., Mil-
licent Prince, public-relations director
for After Six Formals, and Harry Win-
okur, chairman of Mister Donut.
Before going to lunch, Leterman
reads about his guests in a card file kept
by his secretary. This gives personal
details of 15,000 people, including birth-
days, hobbies, and children’s names.
The system works well because he
has an efficient secretary and he does
not drink much at lunch. An Austra-
lian advertising man who tried to emu-
late Leterman’s lunchmanship failed
through weakness in these essentials.
He greeted the guest of honor, a knit-
wear executive: “Hi, Ted! How are
Doris and young Andrew?” The reply
was: “I’m afraid you’re mixing me with
someone else. My wife is Betty and the
boy’s name is Wayne.” After the brandy
and liqueurs the host fell downstairs
and lay unconscious, with his pre-set
alarm watch ringing. Business-wise, the
lunch was only a middling success.
Nonetheless, we have much to learn
from the friendly optimism of Elmer
G. Leterman. “I would rather be
starting my career now than at any
other period of history. Business op-
portunities abound,” he says. That was
part of the trouble with the Lady of
Shalott she could not grasp business
opportunities. I have shown my admira-
tion for Leterman in a practical man-
ner by booking a table for lunch today
at a Greek cafe in Castlereagh Street.
My guest is Les McDill, one of the
up-and-coming men in plastic dolls’
furniture. Anyway, it’s a beginning.

Japan revisited
HAL PORTER is back in Australia
after 4£ months in Japan breaking a
20-year-old “circle of nostalgia.”
He last saw Japan when he was posted
there during the Occupation, and he
has written a novel and a play around
the experience. In both, he “gave the
Japanese the benefit of the doubt,” but
this visit has dealt harshly with many
of his memories.
“A 1984 world ... a Coca-Cola
civilisation in which the Japanese have
beaten the Americans at their own
game” is the impression which has
assaulted him most forcefully this'time,
and left him with the conviction that
the Japanese have done all they can
to wipe out the country he knew
in 1945.
He is now busy collating all the evid-
ence of both research and his senses —
for a “then-and-now” book scheduled
for publication by Angus and Robert-
son.
Part of his visit was for the purpose
of a lecture tour sponsored by the Aus-
tralian Government, but he spent the
rest of the time revisiting the places
he had known well during the Occu-
pation. All were virtually unrecognisable
—except for Nijimura—“the rainbow
village.”
“It was a town built specially for the
Australian officers, their wives and chil-
dren, and it really lived up to its name.
It was splendid with wide avenues,
playgrounds for the children, and
smooth lawns.
“I took a taxi out there this time,
expecting to find it all changed. But it
wasn’t. Something far worse had
happened. The Japanese had left it
completely untouched as a sort of
monument or reminder, I suppose. It
was completely deserted, the roads were
beginning to crack, the smooth lawns
had grown into high grass, and the
rambling roses in the gardens were
growing across the footpaths. I was still
there at dusk and I saw bats flying
around. It was one of the most eerie
experiences I’ve ever had.”
During the Occupation, Porter ad-
mired what he calls Japan’s civilised
acceptance of defeat, but, to his mind,
acceptance soon translated itself into
humiliation. And this humiliation has
led the Japanese to Westernise their
culture and way of life with an alarm-
ing intensity.
British diplomats leave the East
“I’m not anti-modernisation, but it’s
as if they’re trying to concrete over the
whole of Japan. The pace and size of
things can only be fully expressed by
statistics the fleets of trains that
speed through the subways with thous-
ands of people crammed on board, the
vast galleries of underground cities.
“But, more stunning than all of these
are the things the Japanese people are
doing to themselves. They seem to be
to a pattern the girls in their neat
little circumspect dresses, the boys in
neat suits of synthetic materials. And
so many now have had operations to
straighten their eyes that their faces
don’t look quite right.”
And after the book? “Probably a book
of short stories and a play for produc-
tion in the West End in January.”

MICHAEL BAUME WRITES OK
THE
ECONOMY
Can the banks
come alive to
the new policy?
NOW THERE CAN be no doubt about
the significance of the massive change
in economic policy since Sir Roland
Wilson stepped down as Secretary of
the Treasury and Mr. William Mc-
Mahon’s new broom swept through. For
under the relatively new (two Budgets)
Treasurer and his even newer Secretary
of the Treasury (one Budget Sir Rich-
ard Randall), the Australian trading
banks have been given the chance to
come alive again. Whether they can
use the chance is another matter; they
have had so many years in the wilder-
ness that some may have forgotten what
real live banking is all about.
After 20 years of official oppression
that had limited the growth of bank
activity while enabling the “fringe
bankers” to go lickety-split, the Gov-
ernment has changed its course com-
pletely. It is now encouraging the banks
to compete right across the board of
banking functions instead of simply in
the narrowly restricted “traditional”
overdraft and deposit business.
Last week’s further liberalising
by the Reserve Bank of the
scope of trading bank lending (into
previously forbidden short-term mort-
gages and bridging finance at “reason-
able rates of interest”) allows them to
move directly into competition with the
fastest-growing activity of the finance
and hire-purchase companies. It fol-
lows last March’s decision to allow the
banks to make personal loans repayable
on instalments—another field in which
the finance companies have been ex-
panding with much enthusiasm in re-
cent times. And it is accompanied by
more details of the proposed Australian
Resources Development Bank which
clearly show it is to be a much more
useful servant of its trading-bank own-
ers than the original outline had sug-
gested back in the Wilsonian days.
If what the Government is now do-
ing to the banks is the right thing, it
means that its policy for the previous
17 years was all wrong. The old policy
had been to use the banks as the work-
horses of monetary policy; if credit had
to be reduced in the community to pre-
vent inflationary forces getting out of
hand, the w r ay to do it was to prevent
the banks from lending so much. The
fact that the Reserve Bank could not
control the amount of lending being
done by the fringe bankers or that the
Government was flat out trying to bring
as much foreign money as possible into
the country at the same time meant
that this policy was at best unfair and
at worst ineffectual. It meant that while
the banks were being restrained the
other finance institutions could grow
much faster to fill the vacuum (and by
lending at higher rates than banks they
were at the same time increasing Aus-
tralian cost levels).
So, largely as a result of official
policy, the banks came to represent a
steadily diminishing proportion of the
flow of credit in the community; and
as the importance of the banks got
smaller, so the degree of control that
was needed over them to have an im-
pact on the credit levels of the com-
munity at large became so much
greater.
All this has now changed. But why
should the Treasury suddenly take this
more generous attitude with the banks?
The answer probably is that Mr. Mc-
Mahon sees more virtue in the idea that
by spreading the functions of the trad-
ing banks across all the monetary oper-
ations, this effectively spreads the in-
fluence of the Reserve Bank equally far,
for the Reserve Bank has direct control
over the trading banks but not over
the fringe bankers. In the past, the
finance houses have been under official
influence only to the extent that they
have been “asked” to be “good boys” at
times of stress; there have been no
threats or compulsions. In such situa-
tions, being good is a relative affair.
But from later this year, the finance
operators, who depend for their funds
on raising money from the public, will
face the real threat of indirect, but
nevertheless effective and positive Re-
serve Bank control.
FOR THE new Australian Resources
Development Bank (originally named
the Bankers Development Refinance
Corporation, but which will now clearly
be a bank with ability to borrow at
home and abroad and in which all the
banks including the Reserve Bank will
have a stake) will become a major in-
fluence in the local money markets.
It will play a key role in interest-rate
policy, as it will be borrowing from the
public apparently in much more direct
competition with the finance houses
than they have previously had to face
from such a reputable borrower. Pre-
sumably the interest rates it will offer
will be higher than bond rate and much
closer to the finance-company rates
than what the banks are allowed to offer
in their attempts to attract the public’s
money.
Adjustments to its interest rate could
severely affect the supply of cash going
to hire-purchase companies—and the
Reserve Bank will be in the box seat to
make these sort of adjustments. So at
a time when the Reserve Bank is at last
getting some real power over fringe
banking, it is doubly logical simultane-
ously to spread its influance into this
area through the banking system.
There can be no doubt about the
huge size and potential of these “fringe
banking” operations that go on outside
the banking system. Fringe banking’s
massive growth is evident enough from
the operations of those, seven finance
companies in which the trading banks
have shareholding interests.
For it is true the banks did not
entirely miss out on the growth of this
fringe; to get a bit of the action they
all became major shareholders in hire
purchase companies, with E.S. & A.
Bank having a wholly owned hire pur-
chase subsidiary, Esanda. After seeing
how the finance houses were bounding
ahead, mostly the banks bought about
40 percent of the capital of the hire
purchase associates of their choice.
THESE ALONE have money out on
loan to the public in one way or an-
other totalling more than $lOOO million,
or equal to about one-third of the total
advances made by all the major trading
banks (including the Commonwealth,
which does not have a finance company
associate). And until this year, when
the worm eventually turned, the finance
companies had all been expanding their
business at a far faster rate than the
banks were increasing their advances.
But in the latest year, a combination
of a slow down in retail hire purchase
sales (where outstandings have hardly
budged in the past few years) and in-
creasing bank competition because of
greater bank liquidity has meant that
bank advances have moved ahead faster
than finance company outstandings.
And now that the Government’s bank-
ing policy has changed so dramatically,
this could become quite a usual state
affairs.
All in all, the new-look policy on
banking is a darn sight better than the
old one. Now it is up to the trading
banks to show that they are better at
the business of money than most
people give them credit for. There is no
doubt about the calibre of some of our
top bankers. But some of the other
banks do not seem to have taken much
advantage of the new, more liberal situ-
ations they have been faced with in re-
cent times or shown much drive in try-
ing to find new areas of activity. The
pretty poor performance of many banks
in the commercial bill field and the
hesitant approach of some to last
March’s personal loans concession
suggest some need for a more dynamic
approach.

AS I SEE IT
Giving Holt
the rounds
of the Senate
By ALAN REID
THOUGH IT cuts right across the
Labor tradition that Upper Houses
should not be used to thwart the popu-
lar will as expressed in lower chambers,
there is hard-headed shrewdness in the
increasing eagerness of a section of the
Labor Party to use the Senate to dis-
credit the Holt Government.
Basic aim of the Labor Party must
be to divert public attention from its
own deficiencies as a potential alterna-
tive Government on to the weaknesses
of the present Government.
As the history of the Scullin Govern-
ment between 1929 and 1931 demon-
strated, an effective way to discredit a
Government is to point up publicly that
it has lost control of the Parliament or,
in other words, is incapable of govern-
ing.
Constant defeats demoralise a Govern-
ment. Its Ministers start to make
childish errors. Its parliamentary fol-
lowers get discouraged over its in-
capacity to get through the Parliament
legislation other than that to which
members of political parties outside the
Party or Parties nominally governing
will agree. The atmosphere becomes
one of despondency and fatalism, the
impression builds up in the voting com-
munity that the Government it elected
is incapable of governing.
The Holt Government is impregnable
in the House of Representatives. It
possesses a record majority. It is almost
impossible to visualise circumstances in
which a sufficient number of Govern-
ment supporters would cross the House
of Representatives to cause the Govern-
ment any uneasiness.
But the Senate is a different kettle
of fish. The Senate is 60 strong. It
divides into 28 Government Senators,
28 Labor Senators, two Democratic
Labor Party Senators—Gair (Qld.) and
McManus (Vic.) —and two Indepen-
dents —Senator Turnbull (Tas.) and
Senator Hannaford (S.A.).
Hannaford is not so vital. On almost
every issue other than Vietnam his vote
would probably reinforce the Govern-
ment’s 28. But this leaves Gair and
McManus and, to a lesser extent, Turn-
bull the balance of power.
Gair and McManus are clearly hog-
ging for a double dissolution. Their
analysis is that with a double dissolu-
tion and the 60 Senators retiring simul-
taneously instead of 30 at a time, they
would have to get fewer votes to obtain
a Senate quota and the return of a
larger number of DLP senators.
Turnbull is also philosophical about a
double dissolution. It would make his
task of getting re-elected as an Indepen-
dent easier as he would need fewer votes
to get his quota.
The reasoning of the Labor Mem-
bers who are pressing for greater use
of the Senate to discredit the Holt
Government (reasoning of which the
move by ALP Federal President
Senator Jim Keeffe for Labor to re-
vert to opposition to the postal rises
legislation is part) points interestingly
to the strengths and weaknesses of
both sides involved in the struggle
which is now increasingly becoming
focused on the Senate.
These Members believe that Labor
has achieved—temporarily—a more
satisfactory position than for a long
time on foreign affairs, the issue which
undoubtedly contributed to the Labor
debacle in the last Federal elections.
By shrewd tactics, they have shifted
the argument on Vietnam from
whether Australian unilateral with-
drawal of troops from the area would
wreck the Australian-United States
alliance on to how to end the war
in that area (in my view, ignoring
rather conveniently that unless there
is victory by one side it takes both
belligerents to end the war and North
Vietnam has shown no inclination to-
ward ending it).
But they recognise that in the pres-
ent state of affairs they cannot keep
the possible effects of Labor’s Viet-
nam policy upon the Australian-
United States alliance sidetracked
indefinitely.
It is now extremely difficult to pre-
sent China as the peace-loving, non-
belligerent country intent only upon
internal reconstruction the picture
that Labor spokesmen insisted for
a long time was the true one
of China. China has rejected the des-
cription too forcibly itself.
This, from the Australian viewpoint,
could make the preservation of the
Australian-United States alliance even
more important than Australia’s actual
involvement in Vietnam an order
of priorities which the Australian
voting public clearly accepted at the
last Federal elections.
Opposition Leader Gough Whit-
lam clearly smells the danger for him-
self and his Party if this order of
priorities is re-established. His
solution, presented to the Federal Par-
liamentary Labor Party Executive
and Caucus last week, was for him
to become the sole interpreter of Labor
policy and maker of Labor policy
statements on foreign affairs.
Persons he named as embarrassing
offenders in public statements were Dr.
Jim Cairns, Vic., Senator Wheeldon,
W.A., Mr. Gordon Bryant, Vic., and
the President of the Victorian ALP,
Mr. W. Brown.
As far as I can see, their only offence
is that they have stated Labor policy
on Vietnam as laid down by the
recent ALP Federal conference in
Adelaide less ambiguously than their
leader, and I cannot see any of these
four being intimidated into silence
while they are speaking accurately
and within the context of official Fed-
eral Labor policy.
But other members of the Party
see an advantage in using the Senate
and the double dissolution mentality
of the DLP to go on the attack in-
stead of maintaining a purely defen-
sive posture.
Their arguments put briefly are:
With the Government running con-
stantly into trouble in the Senate pub-
lic attention will be diverted from the
international to the local scene. If
Prime Minister Holt and his Govern-
ment yield to Senate pressure the Holt
Government will present publicly the
appearance of a Government that has
lost control of the Parliament.
If they did not yield, and went for
a double dissolution, Labor would still
have the advantage. Holt could not
create in the Senate, through
manoeuvring, a clear-cut issue such as
the future of the Australian-United
States alliance.
The DLP Senators would not let
him. They would support him on
what the Labor Members describe as
any “hardline” proposal. He could
only get a double dissolution on a
domestic issue, which would be to his
disadvantage.
Himself an incurable optimist,
backed by the “no election” Group
which is always strong in any par-
liamentary Party, he would, like
Micawber, hope for something to turn
up to save him from his troubles and
would not grasp the nettle until the
prickles had grown so long as to be
savagely wounding. If his Government
was visibly eroding, attention would
be diverted from foreign affairs to local
issues.
It is against this background that
political manoeuvres are currently tak-
ing shape.
If the Senate lobby in Caucus get
their way and the Senate is used in-
creasingly by Labor in the weeks ahead,
it is the Senate rather than the House
of Representatives that is going to have
real significance in the current par-
liamentary session.


Fast lady
This girl is able to handle 25 external lines and hundreds of internal extensions, with smooth
efficiency ... and still look after the petty cash.
The first thing you notice, when you
install the STC Pentaconta Pushbutton
PABX, is the staff saving. One girl can
supervise a large board, like this 200-line
extendible unit, with ease. You'll also
notice the gain in communications effi-
ciency.
Your customers will notice it too. They
will discover that calls into your business
are always answered promptly, never
cut off. You will find inter-departmental
and outside calls all go through faster.
Fact is, you now have working for you the
most advanced business telephone system
there is: STC Pentaconta.
The STC Pentaconta does more for you
than any.other system. For example, any-
one in your organisation receiving a call
will be able to transfer the caller direct to
any other extension, simply by pressing a
button, without recalling the operator.
Anyone, on any extension, can hold an
outside exchange call while making a
second call, inside or outside. You can
even dial from any extension direct to
your mobile radio vehicles. These features,
speed and reliability, make the STC
Pentaconta much more than a telephone
system: it's an investment in overall
business efficiency. And more and more
companies, large and not-so-large, are
finding how well it pays off.

Dravo can build the plants to breathe new life into steel production
Dravo designs and constructs
basic oxygen steelmaking plants
to help the steel industry increase
productivity. Basic oxygen fur-
naces are speeding up the process
of steelmaking. A modern BOF
may yield as much steel in one
hour as an open hearth could
produce in eight.
One of the reasons basic oxy-
gen furnaces operate more effi-
ciently is the use of burned lime
instead of limestone as a flux.
Dravo builds plants for production
of lime as well as BOF facilities.
One of the newest BOF facilities
is at Natrona, Pennsylvania, near
Pittsburgh. The Dravo-built melt
shop complex is being used for
the production of high speed spe-
cialty steels. In addition, Dravo
designed and built a hot blast
cupola, its two holding ladles, a
scrap charger, and a river dock
to serve the plant.
The process development and
plant construction skills needed
to build these facilities can be
utilised for a wide variety of engi-
neering and construction prob-
lems. Or they might be combined
with Dravo capabilities to build
ore pelletising plants, vacuum de-
gassing installations or water
treatment facilities.

AUSTRALIA
Now it’s “stop, hold everything,
let’s decide where we’re going”
GOVERNMENT IS USUALLY a very
hand to mouth ad hoc business, the pro-
duct of a series of small decisions.
Especially in Australia under a conser-
vative administration.
The sheer volume of decisions re-
quired day in and day out leaves the
administration with little time to think
in broader terms about where it is go-
ing. The three-year parliamentary
term, with Senate elections intruding,
also keeps electoral considerations to the
forefront of Ministerial minds. Unless a
conscious effort is occasionally made to
allocate time and senior people to the
task, overall strategy is seldom reviewed.
The beginning of a series of high-level
strategy talks about the future of our
defence and foreign policies is therefore
an event of great significance. On this
scale, such a thing has never happened
before.
The talks are being attended by the
Defence and Foreign Affairs Committee
of Cabinet (Holt, McMahon, Hasluck,
Fairhall, Gorton, Hulme, Sinclair, and
McEwen), the Defence Committee
(Bunting, Randall, Plimsoll, and
Blakers as the departmental heads, and
the four service chiefs) together with
the four Service Ministers.
These 20 men are engaged in what
External Affairs Minister, Mr. Hasluck,
described as a “fundamental re-
appraisal.” The exercise has been
divided into some two dozen topics, and
a series of papers are flowing into
Cabinet.
The talks are centred on Malay-
sia and Vietnam, and are an attempt
to work out a coherent negotiatiing
position—first with Britain, Singapore,
and Malaysia, and second with the
United States and Asian allies.
Little concrete news is coming out of
these talks so far; the interdependence
of the various questions prevents many
decisions being made.
A few technical points have emerged.
One is that the Army has found a way
to have four of its eight battalions on
overseas service. Previously it was felt
that three was the maximum, and that
any attempt to find a fourth would dis-
rupt the Army.
There are two battalions in Vietnam
at present and one in Malaysia, and the
availability of a fourth gives the Govern-
ment welcome scope for manoeuvre. It
means that the Malaysia commitment
could be doubled immediately, or else
that the Vietnam Task Force could
be raised to full brigade strength.
The External Affairs Department is,
in the new spirit of “reappraisal,” to re-
vive its practice of making an annual
report on its activities. The last such
report was in 1942, when a staff of five
was put on the job, with one P. Hasluck
trailing the list as “temporary officer.”

Defence
Money's worth
IF EVER THE Government set out to
say it was mismanaging defence pur-
chases it said it last week in Parlia-
ment.
For a long time to come the following
statement by Defence Minister Fairhall
will be used against the Government
“Whatever may be said about this air-
craft (the F-111), Mr. Speaker, we’ll
be getting our money’s worth, regard-
less of the cost.”
So the cost does not matter, says the
Government. We get out money’s worth,
however much money we must spend.
And why, the critics ask, is this pro-
ject so special that unlike other parts
of our defence program, cost does not
matter?
Because, says Mr. Fairhall, this aero-
plane is “on the frontier of knowledge.”
Critics “with all the joy of ignorance,
keep on referring to the Fill as an
aeroplane. It is not an aeroplane, it is
a weapons system,” says Mr. Fairhall.
Neither Mr. Fairhall, nor Air Minister
Howson, nor any other Government
Minister attempted to undercut their
critics by spelling out the contingencies
in which such a “weapons system”
would be of such decisive value that
its cost does not matter.
Mr. Fairhall seemed transfixed by its
electronic, almost biological elegance,
quoting in its support this assessment
from a newspaperman in Fort Worth,
the Fill production centre:
“The Fill is a super battle bird, the
greatest thing with wings since angels.
It is ‘the Cadillac of the air.’ It flies
high and low, fast and slow, throws a


power punch tougher than five World
War II heavy bombers and sniffs out
targets like a thirsty vampire . . .”
As if to reveal his own inner doubts
about this sort of pop-PR, the Defence
Minister finished his incredible speech
throwing in the phrase, “If it fails in
service that will then be the time to
criticise . . .”
Disastrously, Navy Minister Chipp
followed. He got his ships wrong, speak-
ing of the destroyers Hobart and Bris-
Navy Minister Chipp ... wrong ships
bane as having been delivered, when in
fact the Brisbane is still on the slip-
rail in the U.S.
Then he very honestly admitted that
the Navy had “found it necessary to
order more base spares than was at
first envisaged as necessary.”
The only trouble was he happened,
in saying that, to be contradicting his
colleague Mr. Fairhall who, 20 minutes
earlier, had said: “That $3.2m. was
never designed to be the estimate of
spares required for this vessel. Indeed,
we knew beyond peradventure that the
requirement of spares would be vastly
higher than that because my colleague
and his people in the Department of
the Navy have been operating ships
long enough to know this is an unreal-
istic figure.”
Shipping and trade
A Jeremiad
IT IS NOT CUSTOMARY for
Government Members to use their
time in the Budget debate to take a
tilt at Government policy, but Federal
Member Malcolm Mackay got a little
bit of personal criticism off his chest
when he entered the debate late on
Thursday night.
Dr. Malcolm Mackay, former Syd-
ney headmaster and still a Presby-
terian minister, praised Australia’s
role in Vietnam, but urged greater
Government effort on the home front
to ensure that everyone knew why this
struggle was necessary.
The main theme of this segment of
his speech was that Red China must
be contained if the world wanted to
avoid a nuclear holocaust and the war
in Vietnam was an essential plug
against Chinese hordes pouring south.
The Maoists, among other things,
had to be prevented from expansion
in the military sense, and every effort
had to be made to see they were dis-
credited within China itself as much
as possible, Malcolm Mackay told a
rather empty House of Representa-
tives.
“I agree that there is not a great
deal which we at this distance can
do ourselves, but the first thing that
comes to my mind is the matter of
trade with China by Australia and
other free nations.”
He said, “The Chinese trade only
to build up their economy where
their farming programs and other
objectives internally are not realised.
“Although many subtle and com-
plicated arguments perhaps very
sincere arguments could be adduced
as to why trade in wheat between
Australia and China should continue,
I believe it is time for a careful
audit, not dominated by sectional
interest or political advantage, to be
made to determine the precise impli-
cations of our trade its advantages
and disadvantages.
“I believe that such an audit could
show it to be a fundamental folly,
if not a grievous double dealing, to
continue along this road.”
Dr. Mackay then turned his atten-
tion to a field allied to trade the
transport of the goods involved.
He said, “There would appear to be
grave discrepancies between the fre-
quently stated Australianism on the part
of the Minister for Trade during his
visits overseas—l applaud it —and in his
recent comments on the United States
and the United Kingdom, and the prac-
tice of some senior departmental
officers in the matter of overseas ship-
ping.
“I make the unequivocal statement
that it would not be difficult to develop
an overseas shipping line on a private
enterprise basis in which overseas
expert operators would be prepared
to contribute capital and know-how
through a minority shareholding, with
the majority under Australian control.
“I have spoken with the chairmen
and directors of several such com-
panies overseas who would be per-
pared to engage in such an enterprise
which could bring to Australia some of
the tremendous rewards presently going
to overseas operators if safeguarded
from unfair tactics employed against it
by would-be monopolists.”
Dr. Mackay is not alone in his
views but it is doubtful if any others
on the Government backbench would
care to, if they could, put them for-
ward as soundly and as forcefully.

Propaganda
Powerful answer
THE PROSPECT OF elections usually
jogs a Government into greater action
to justify its policies and rebut the argu-
ment of its critics.
But the Federal Government, at least,
hardly seems to have the dynamism or
imagination to counter what Mr. Holt
has called “the campaign of psycho-
logical warfare” against its Vietnam
policies.
An example came to light last week.
The External Affairs Department
finished work on an analysis of some of
the Left-wing claims about civilian
casualties in the Vietnam War. It con-
centrated particularly on the gory
Ramparts pamphlet with the claim of
a million child casualties and vast
numbers of grotesque injuries from
napalm. This pamphlet was distributed
to every voter in the Corio electorate
prior to Labor’s dramatic victory there.
And its distributors, the Liberal Re-
form Group, say they hope to dis-
tribute it throughout Australia before
the Senate elections.
External Affairs has produced a long,
quiet analysis. It admits the possibility
of up to 100,000 civilian casualties in
South Vietnam this year, of which
25,000 might be children. About 25
percent of casualties are likely to result
in death.
“An estimated 40 percent of civilian
war casualties are attributable to Com-
munist action, about 30 percent to
South Vietnamese, American, and allied
action, and the remaining 30 percent to
small-arms and mortar fire which could
have been caused by either side.
“A small percentage of civilian hos-
pitalisations are burns cases, of which
the greatest number is attributable to
accidents. Proved cases of napalm and
phosphorous burns are few.
“Many of the civilian casualties
caused by allied action are due to the
Viet Cong practice of using civilians as
a shield to cover military actions . . .”
The study concludes that “the alle-
gations in Ramparts and similar pub-


lications are based on unproven, exag-
gerated, and often distorted or fab-
ricated evidence.” It cites several in-
stances of which the Ramparts pam-
phlet uses United States Information
Agency photographs of the victims of
Communist attacks and labels them the
victims of allied action.
A powerful answer, one might think,
to the purveyors of massive horror
stories about what we are doing in
Vietnam. But who is it distributed to?
A printing of 10,000 or 20,000? No,
100 copies are roneoed off and sent to
Government members of Parliament.
This small girl, alleged by Ramparts
to have been hurt by American bomb-
ing, was in fact the victim of a Viet
Cong attack on the Catholic village of
Dong Xoai, in Phuoc Long province
north of Saigon
Total wage
ACTU appeal
THE DECISION OF the executive
Australian Council of Trade Unions’
to appeal to the High Court against the
Arbitration Commission’s verdict accep-
ting the principle of the “total wage”
has not been greeted with universal
approval in industrial circles. Some
officials doubt that there is much chance
of winning the case, others don’t believe
it is worth winning anyway.
The doubters have good grounds for
their caution. The argument before
the High Court will have to be on
a point of law. There will be no oppor-
tunity for the ACTU to repeat the
whole range of its industrial economic
case in favor of the basic wage and
margins system. With these circum-
stances in mind, it is important to note
that the Commonwealth Government
was opposed to the employers’ case for
the total wage when it was first pro-
moted in 1964.
The Commonwealth has since
changed its mind but it always allowed
that it was within the powers of the
Arbitration Commission to bring in the
total wage if it thought it should. If
the Commonwealth had entertained
serious doubts about the legality, it
would certainly have raised them in
1964 and probably would have con-
tinued to raise them since.
However, the ACTU, after receiving
its own legal advice, believes it has a
reasonable chance of making a success-
ful challenge and will probably soon
take out a writ against the Arbitration
Commission to prohibit it from enforc-
ing one of its awards. Its case will
then be that the Commission, in abolish-
ing the basic wage, has exceeded its
legal powers.
The Arbitration Act does not ex-
plicitly demand that the Commission
must make its judgments in terms of
basic wage and margins, but the unions
will claim that the Act implies that
these two components be kept and that
the total wage decision was beyond the
jurisdiction of the Commission and an
implicit violation of the Act.
The legal issues aside, there is rea-
son for thinking that ACTU opposition
to the total wage is based more on
traditional slogans about the sacredness
of the basic wage than on analysis of
the facts. As was recently pointed out
in the privately circulated Sydney pub-
lication “The Industrial Newsletter”:
“While the increase and the total
wage took the headlines in this year’s
national wage case, perhaps an equally
important sentence came on page 8 of
the judgment. It was, ‘the increase
will be added to the new minimum of
standard created in July last.’
“What this clearly means is that
although the basic wage has gone, the
new minimum wage level is here to
stay. The decision went on to say: ‘ln-
dustrial justice demands that this stan-
dard should be reviewed regularly.”
There is indeed some case for claim-
ing that the ACTU is fighting the
Arbitration Commission on the wrong
ground; that what it should be chal-
lenging is the legality of the Com-
mission’s excursions into economics.
Education
Tertiary colleges
VICTORIA’S INSTITUTE OF COL-
LEGES is one State’s response to the
national problem that secondary schools
are sending out thousands of matricu-
lated students qualified for university
courses but unable to gain university
places. The immediate aim is to place
the bulk of these students in an im-
proved technical college system which
will offer liberal arts courses as well
as technological courses.
There is general acceptance of the
Martin Report’s recommendation that
“the education of technological
students should be broadened by
inclusion in curricula of relevant and
integrated liberal studies,” and approval
for the Martin finding that “the pre-
sent system of tertiary education in
Australia places an undue emphasis on
university education. As a result, the
weakness of non-university tertiary in-
stitutions prevents the latent abilities
of many young Australians from being
developed.”
There are two objections to Victoria’s
plans. The first has been an expression,
by the Liberal Arts Association, of dis-
quiet at the proposed course for the
Diploma of Liberal Arts. In the
vocations which the Diploma is
supposed to serve: teaching, radio and
television work, journalism, advertising,
salesmanship, and the Public Service,
the Association says “whether we are
thinking of artists or administrators, the
qualification they most need in addition
to their natural talents is a good general
education . . .”
The other major objection to the
plans of the Institute of Colleges is
administrative. The president of the
RMIT said last week his council held
strongly that this can best be
achieved if the colleges are treated
as tertiary institutions similar to
universities and not as schools forming
a part of the Education Department
system.
Promotion
Blessed land
For several years now, real estate
men have been flying prospective home
owners up the coast of N.S.W. to look
at various land blocks. But two real
estate companies and a public relations
firm, James, Douglas have devised a
supreme junket. Last weekend, they
took 42 Greeks by flying boat to Wallis
Lake, 150 miles north of Sydney, for a
ceremony in honor of St. Nectario,
with eight whole lambs roasted and
wine drunk. This was to celebrate the
opening of the Hydra Project, named
after an island in the Aegean.
The new Hydra is a peninsula con-
sisting of thousands of acres of land
which were released for development
some years ago. Forster Projects bought
the land and handed a piece of it over
to the Greek Orthodox Church to build
a church there, The idea is that the
church’s establishment will be followed
by Greek settlers buying the land
for holiday homes in a “spiritual
and recreation centre.” To assist them
in the promotion, James, Douglas’ D. J.
Golding has valuable contacts; he owns
three suburban newspapers widely read
by the Greek community.


Queensland.
The Wallum Belt
QUEENSLAND’S WALLUM COUN-
TRY, called by the Aboriginal name for
the banksia plant growing within the
area, is a belt of sandy, swamp, infer-
tile land behind the State’s north
coast, extending from near Gladstone to
the N.S.W. border. The Wallum Belt
comprises three million acres of which
one-quarter million is Crown land. The
rest is forestry reserves or under private
ownership.
In 1952, the Queensland Primary In-
dustries Department and the CSIRO
began joint experiments to find what
plants would grow in the varying soils
in the area and what fertilisers would
be needed to make them grow. At first,
work was done on horticultural crops
as well as pasture plants. Then large
numbers of pasture plants (grasses and
legumes) were introduced from over-
seas and, in the course of time, the
right fertilisers were worked out. Experi-
mentation has now reached the stage
where, under grazing, highly productive
pastures can be developed.
Describing the experiments, Mr. N.
F. Fox of the Queensland Primary In-
dustries Department, says: “On well-
established pastures, under experimental
conditions, it is now possible to fatten
a beast to the acre and produce live-
weight gains in excess of 300 pounds per
acre per year.” He says that most of
the research work has been done in the
southern section of the Wallum country,
Davidson, CP
Pearce, Liberal
Gray, ALP
where rainfall exceeds 60 inches a year.
But in areas near Bundaberg-Mary-
borough, where the soil is equally infer-
tile and the rainfall is 40 inches, it is
conservatively estimated that pastures
can be developed to support a beast to
each two to three acres.
On these figures, it is clear that what
is taking place now in making this sandy,
swampy, badly drained land fertile is as
great and as exciting for Queensland’s
future as the development of the 90-mile
desert country was for South Australia.
Additionally, Queensland’s Wallum Belt
has rainfall and sunshine to help what
science has discovered can be done to
transform the area.
Wallum land was first opened up
more than three years ago, and since
then up to a dozen blocks, averaging
4000 acres each, have been settled. Two
more thrown open this year have drawn
six applications from the U.S.A. (Texas)
and Victoria, S.A., and Queensland.
These blocks are in the Maryborough
Lands Agent’s district.
Australians applying for these blocks
are mostly substantial graziers who, be-
cause of diminishing land supply, are
looking to Queensland and Western Aus-
tralia for properties for their sons. Wal-
lum land is not for the little man
scratching for capital. It is for the man
who is prepared to spend money to clear
land and carry out the proved experi-
ments in fertilising and planting which
will result in improved pastures for
cattle fattening.
Capricornia
By-election
THIS SATURDAY, ALP members in
Capricornia electorate will begin a
plebiscite to select their candidate for
a September 30 by-election as impor-
tant to both Federal parties as Corio.
The Government hopes to win the
seat from Labor, represented by the late
George Gray since 1961, and claim
public approval of the recent Budget.
Labor wants a win to claim that its
Corio victory meant something, and
might mean even more at the coming
Senate elections.
Either way, the history of the elec-
torate suggests that victory in Capri-
cornia will prove little. Since Frank
Forde lost the seat in 1946 after a 24-
year tenure, Capricornia has changed
party allegiance three times, going
Country Party with Charles Davidson,
Liberal with George Pearce, and Labor
with Gray.
Most political analysts expect the
ALP to hold the seat easily, after Corio,
even with a new man standing. Others
say much will depend on the chosen
candidate’s “local” image. Capri-
cornia, running along the central
Queensland coast and adjoining Dawson,
has strong pockets of Country Party
voters interested in Northern Develop-
ment; a QLP vote which has swung
from 9 percent in 1958 to nearly 13
percent in 1963 and back to about 9
percent in 1966; and generally has
swung from a Liberal absolute majority
of 5700 in 1958 to a Labor absolute
majority of nearly 4700 in 1963 (dim-
inishing to about 1700 last year, when
the national tide was strongly against
Labor but not so either in Capricornia
or Dawson).
QLP preferences have been very un-
stable in Capricornia. In 1958 only 15
percent of them drifted to Labor, in
1961 the drift in QLP preferences was
nearly 46 percent. For the by-election,
all four parties will be fielding a can-
didate, bringing the Country Party
back into the campaigning for the
first time in 18 years.
Against this background, Capricornia
appears anyone’s race. Consensus of
opinion in the electorate is that much
will depend on whether the chosen ALP
candidate will be a moderate, or some-
one identified with the “old guard” and
then, how well known locally, and
finally how he stands on Northern De-
velopment.
Western Australia
Head of steam
SIX MONTHS BEFORE the next
State election, the Western Australian
Liberal-Country Party coalition Gov-
ernment has taken on an unjustified
smugness. Admittedly this is politically
an off-season, but Premier David Brand,
badly shaken last year by reverses
brought about from within his own
ranks, has been cracking the whip with
a vigor that has antagonised a number
of his supporters.
To over-simplify a complex political
situation (and disregard the Country
Party complication) it could be said
that the Government depends for its
support on two groups of people
businessmen and white-collar workers.
The businessmen have been jarred on
their pocket nerve by indirect taxation,
made necessary by the State’s phenome-
nal development rate. And this develop-
ment, in turn, has helped create a high
average level of prosperity; but some
of the white-collar workers, not hitched
directly to general prosperity nor
hitched indirectly by active union or
professional organisations, feel only the
backlash paying out more for the
food and services they need.
Affluence-to-come has been promised
by the Brand-Court axis since election
to power in 1959, and now that it is
actually here for so many it has had a
number of interesting side-effects. Turn-
ing from bread-and-butter issues, West-
ern Australians have become increas-
ingly concerned at the way their State,

Cultural centre schemes, town plan-

tainted with socialism.
Another offbeat political factor has
emerged from a Royal Commission into
reporting on the State’s Totalisator
Agency Board. Leader of the Opposi-
tion, John Tonkin, had been a mono-
tonous critic of the TAB and was seen
as a champion of the SP bookies.
Revelations of the Commission, which
have surprised a number of people,
have largely vindicated Mr. Tonkin’s
opposition. Against this, he still carries
a heavy burden as equally monotonous
critic of fluoridation.
Western Australian prosperity, while
shifting the ground under a number of
traditional Liberal voters, must also
have moved many into the ground of
the Right Wing, if not directly at least
through a grasping of the comfortable
status quo. Even if the Opposition could
exploit to the full the latent unease
finding some cause that could be whip-
ped up into fervent support they
would still be starting from behind
scratch with the retirement of several
stalwarts in changing electorates and the
lacklustre leadership which is ripe for
a shakeout.
Earlier this year, the Liberals of the
West acknowledged that dangerous
communications gaps were opening up;
the Government has offered strategic
compromises on public issues where a
head of steam had been building up,
at the same time managing to shift the
Premier Brand... whip-cracking
blame from themselves to Canberra for
what Charles Court calls the “new
irritant” of indirect taxation. Perhaps
the biggest hurdle at this stage is to
acknowledge that not everything in the
garden is rosy. Unless more honest
assessment is forthcoming, a number of
Liberals could vote anti-Government to
prick the bubble of smugness some-
thing they would not do if they felt
there was a chance of a Labor Govern-
ment being elected.
So there are strong pragmatic and
.'moral reasons for Mr. Brand to follow
'a Liberal policy more actively and pub-
licly. His main worries are within his
own backyard, making the quality of
)his leadership the measure of the Liberal
Government’s success at the coming elec-
tions.
Obituary
H. K. Prior
By DAVID ADAMS
THE LATE Henry Kenneth Prior
was born at Broken Hill in 1893, the
year his father’s first contribution to
The Bulletin was published. Prior sen.,
(Samuel Henry), then on the editorial
staff of the “Barrier Miner,” was invi-
ted by The Bulletin’s founder, J. F.
Archibald, to join the paper’s perma-
nent staff in 1897 and again in 1901;
he did join The Bulletin in 1903, on
Archibald’s retirement.
Young Ken Prior, after education at
Sydney High, joined his father as
assistant on the “Wild Cat Column”
in 1910. Five years later, at 22, he
was in the AIF, and his father the same
year became editor of The Bulletin, on
the retirement of James Edmond.
Ken Prior became a major in a
howitzer battery in Flanders. Returning
to Australia in 1919, in Fremantle he
was handed a diverted cable from Wil-
liam Macleod, then The Bulletin’s chief
shareholder, offering him managership
of the paper following the death of
Norman Macleod in the influenza epi-
demic.
As manager, Ken Prior insisted on
founding the “Woman’s Mirror” in
1924, against the inclinations of man-
aging-director William Macleod; and
Ken picked A. F. (“Bert”) Toy as
editor. The “Mirror” was an immediate
success, and inside 12 months was
showing a profit.
During the 13 years that “H.K.P.”
was manager of The Bulletin News-
paper Company Pty. Ltd., his father
was editor or managing-editor of The
Bulletin, until his death on June 6,
1933. There had been an unusually
close bond, even for father and son,
between the two.
From then until his retirement in
1961, “H.K.P.” was chairman and
managing director of the company, and
the Prior family were the controlling
H. K. Prior
shareholders. Born into The Bulletin
tradition, Ken followed its practice of
leaving responsibility for opinion and
policy in the hands of the editor, though
he was a keen reader of proofs and
pounced on errors of fact. With his own
baby, “The Woman’s Mirror,” his activi-
ties were more direct.
Though a quiet and retiring man, his
wit and personality pervaded his office
and his home, and he was one of Aus-
tralia’s well-known newspaper “chiefs.”
He delighted in coping with mechanical
problems. Any breakdown in the com-
plex process of producing his news-
papers, and Ken was on the job until
the matter was solved. He had a flair
for devising short-cuts out of trouble;
and troubles there were in plenty during
the Depression and World War 11.
The problems of independent weekly
newspapers became progressively more
difficult.
Ken Prior died on August 5 this year
at the age of 74, exactly 22 years after
the death of his wife, Mollie (Mary).
The day before he died he was at work,
as usual, at the Prior Press, Brookvale,
which he and two of his sons, Jack and
Bill, had established after control of
The Bulletin passed to Consolidated
Press in 1960. He was still chairman of
King and Prior Pty. Ltd., which he and
L.L. King had formed in the 1930 s
a paper-distributing house now managed
by his other son, Philip.
Ken Prior’s 51 years with The Bulle-
tin brought him into contact with most
of the now legendary personalities of
Australia’s developing literary and artis-
tic period: Lawson, Paterson, the Lind-
says, the Dysons, and all that surge of
talent emanating from the ’nineties and
branching off into different channels
ever since. He worked with four of the
paper’s first editors (there had only been
six in its first 80 years) and knew the
founding editor, Archibald. The second
editor, W. H. Traill, he probably never
met.

ZARA
HOLT
INTERVIEWED BY
CHARLES HIGHAM
I HAD obstinately retained an image
of The Lodge as enormous, dowdy,
hung with emblems of the Crown, de-
spite photographs of its facelift, and
from the newspaper reports and dis-
gracefully unflattering Press photo-
graphs Zara Holt as a -slightly daffy,
jolly, and comfortable housewife with
no more than niceness and common-
sense to get her through the ordeals of
top-level international travel. In both
cases I was wrong: The Lodge turned
out to be of only moderate size. The
study glowed with dark woods, lamps
were bright with richly colored shades,
living-room snug with thick green pile
carpet and green chairs. Everything was
subdued, tasteful, discreet, and very
luxurious. And Zara Holt turned out to
be chic, beautifully groomed in dark
blue, very feminine, a woman of great
charm, well read, and entirely of the
’sixties, with a precise mind that can
recall the minutest details of a film, a
book, a conversation, a place. Articulate
and fluent, chainsmoking when under
pressure, she never hesitated or sought
for words during the course of a tax-
ing interview that spread across two
and a half hours and was only ter-
minated by her husband’s arrival for
lunch.
I asked her how tough the schedules
were on her trips abroad. “A nightmare,
Very tough. We took a doctor with us
to Asia, because there were 27 of us,
including the newspeople. And you
can’t afford to be ill. Diplomatically,
you simply can’t be ill, because the
trouble is usually stomach trouble from
the local water in each country. But
all 27 of us did get sick. And the doctor
just handed out a couple of pills here
and a couple of pills there and an
injection or two and he kept us on
our feet or we’d all have been lying
in rows on the landing ground,
Sometimes the heat exhausted us,
and the rush. Half the time it was
freezing, and the other half it was boil-
ing. In two and a half hours you’re in
a different country, but one can’t take
any notice of what the clock says. And
it’s worse when you cross the dateline
into America. You’re exhausted, you
want to climb into bed, and it’s five
o’clock local time, and you’ve just got
time to climb into a dress and go to
a great, big reception and then to din-
ner. It’s really desperate, as it’s really
some very early morning hour by our
time.
“Trying to press a man’s suit with
one of those travelling irons at 11
o’clock at night and it’s on a bed and
it ends up full of fluff, well, you just
can’t do it. You’re nearly frantic, you
want to roll your hair and there’s no
time, and on a public holiday or a
Sunday there’s no hotel valet service.
'“I have to carry spot cleaners and
shoe-polishing stuff. Sometimes I have
to buy special things. You have to have
slacks while you’re climbing up and
down ladders. And I’d buy something
like half a dozen pairs of Schiaparelli
mutation mink non-seam stockings. And
Harold would say, ‘What do you want
that for? We’re going to Europe, and
there are shops everywhere!’ I’d say,
‘But I haven’t got time to go to shops.’
You see, if you cross your foot in a
plane you can so easily rip your stock-
ings with your heel. And you can’t
arrive with a ladder in your stockings,
can you?
“The strain over the luggage is so


bad that on this last trip I even walked
in my sleep, and I’ve never done that
in my life before. I got out of bed and
went across to Harry’s bed and I said,
‘l’m sorry to wake you, but we’re leav-
ing in half an hour.’ And he said, ‘What
are you thinking about? It’s two o’clock
in the morning! We’re not leaving till
11.’ The poor thing didn’t go back to
sleep again that night.
“And it’s constant packing, and three
o’clock in the morning take-offs, and
getting out on the lawn of the White
House with what feels like every
camera in America on you, and you
know the pictures are going back to
Australia and all your friends say, ‘You
looked a bit rumpled.’ Or, ‘Why didn’t
you have your hair done?’ You have
to take one flying leap at the luggage
when it arrives, and everything has to
be listed in the suitcases, and I have
hot-country suitcases and cold-country
suitcases.”
I asked about that Asian tour, which
had gone “very fast indeed,” so fast
that she had a little difficulty in re-
membering which country had come
first—and had taken her to Cambodia,
Laos, Korea, and National China. She
had begun with Cambodia: “I was
very impressed with it. In 11 years
they’ve got from the stage of import-
ing rice to exporting it. There’s not the
unemployment there was. At every city
"You've just got time to climb into a dress and go to a great big reception ..."


you go to I would like to see this
done here they have a quite small
and inexpensive pavilion which has
baskets full of different sorts of rice,
for example, and above it they have
charts and they would show you how
much the rice production went up and
how much had been shipped. And this
was done with everything—how many
children born each year, how many go-
ing to university, how many hospitals,
how many miles of roads had been built,
and so on. Anyone who wants to im-
port from Cambodia can go to these
pavilions and get all the information
he wants. It’s marvellous.
“We never saw an adverse banner, a
cross face, there wasn’t a boo among
all those thousands of people at the
sides of the roads. Sometimes the
crowds were organised, sometimes not,
it didn’t matter. At first, I thought, it’s
all so militarised. But it’s bound to
happen: you get out of a plane, the
troops are lined up, and the brass band
is playing, and then the Mayor or
Prime Minister makes a speech about
‘their distinguished guests,’ and of
course they have to scratch the bottom
of the barrel to find everything there
has been of friendship between the
two countries. It had to be this way,
which was a good thing, as it reminded
us of how much we had helped each
other in the past.
“We called at Laos next. Laos is a
sad country; they’ve been overrun by
so many countries. People tell you
there they can afford to plough only
two percent of the national income
back on the country. Everything else
is going into defending their frontiers.
It’s frightful. And the hospitals! Too
sad for words! The people come down
wounded from the hills, the hill people,
and they come down with a leg shot
off and none of the doctors and nurses
can speak their language, and they sit
there for three months with nobody to
talk to. In silence. It’s so tragic, but
they are fighting back.
“But 1 loved the Laotian dancing
and music. You can’t, you know, buy
cloth there at all. The women, even
the Ministers’ wives, weave the material
for their own families with spinning-
wheels and looms. I saw this woman
weaving the most intricate design, and
she didn’t have a pattern to look at,
or anything to count. It was all done
by memorising.
“Taiwan, by contrast with Laos, was
exciting. It’s like the ancient pictures:
the crag with the hut and the fir tree
and the waterfall, it’s just like walk-
ing into an old screen. They’ve got an
enormous population there for such
an island, but everybody’s got a job,
and it’s the only country in the world
I’ve ever been to where the farmers
are happy. They are growing three
crops where they grew one, they’ve got
irrigation organised, and dams, and
they have a farmers’ parliament; they
elect the members, and the two govern-
ments of Taiwan, as it were, meet and
discuss their problems. And it works.
“Even the smallest bits of ground,
even on a traffic clover-leaf, have vege-
tables or rice planted. They don’t waste
a thing. They make toys for export out
of straw. And they’re beautiful.
Madame Chiang Kai Shek is a very
brilliant and handsome woman. A brain
like a steel saw. And a very good artist
in scrolls, peonies, chrysanthemums,
which are very hard to draw. They
usually turn into a blob or a cabbage.
They have in their national art gallery
the largest collection of Chinese art
in the world, and I asked them how
did they get it out. They said on
the navy boats, and I thought perhaps
they should have brought more refu-
gees . . . but it was unfair thinking,
of course, because the people went
there and the art was all crated and
hidden for protection, as all countries
under attack did in World War 11. If
they changed the whole exhibit of art
every three months, it would take some-
thing like 30 years to work through the
collection.
“I loved Korea. The Koreans have
broad shoulders, the cold climate makes
them strong. Everybody looks fit.
There’s thick snow in winter, so that
nothing grows. You think at first there’s
nothing to eat except a few cattle kept
under the house, but they chop up cab-
bage and spices and vinegar and they
put these down in the autumn in great
earthenware jars and they let the snow
come over the sealed tops, and they
eat it during the winter. This method
of pickling preserves all the vitamins.
It’s a very ancient method. Did you
know the Koreans had the first central
heating in the world? The chimneys
from the kitchen used to run under the
floor and you sit on these mats and it’s
as warm as toast. And they did that
before the Romans.”
Of all her memories, the most strik-
ing had been an occasion in Korea.
“They had almost a million people to
greet us, streamers, children. The
Mayor gave Harold the Key of Seoul
and Harold made a speech back. And
these children all screamed their heads
off, and the noise was deafening. And
they played our national anthem and
theirs, and they said, ‘Now the band
is going to play especially for you a
tune they have learned, a truly Aus-
tralian tune.’ And they struck up
‘Botany Bay’! I threw Harold’s hat in
the air!”
Perhaps her chief impression of Asia
had been how much they had learned
from us, how they wanted to learn
more: for instance, about how Aus-
tralians had been educated in the
change-over from pounds to dollars.
They all said that to change the local
money could cause a revolution, every-
one would think the money was going
to be taken from them. They were
frightened that “the great might of
America would roll over them,” as
this had always happened to them in
the past with other nations where they
allowed them to bring in their armies
to help, but they weren’t afraid of
Australia. She saw our role as a nation
feeding and giving more and more aid
to peoples already deeply fond of us,
“and if we can do that, we’re entitled
to keep this country. But a vacuum
we’re not entitled to keep.”
She said she enjoyed visits to the
White House, but didn’t feel it would
be very comfortable to live in (“I
wouldn’t want a White House for my-
self”). “Everybody can look at you, for
one thing. You can peer through the.
garden railing and say, ‘Look, there’s
the President with his dog.’ There’d
really be nothing to stop you with a
telescopic rifle if you were mad enough.”
In Asia: “Never an adverse banner,
She had an amazingly detailed eye
for the decor of the White House’s
interior, describing it right down to
chairs and tables, the Manets and
Monets and Cezannes presented by the
American rich for the nation’s benefit,
the gold rooms and the blue rooms.
Camp David had impressed her, with
its special houses for each guest, and
small electrical devices like golf bug-
gies to transport the guests from one
part of the great estate to another.
Johnson? “His main interests are poli-
tics and his cattle and his ranch. He’s
a country man. Sort of homespun. Our
conversation was restricted to scenery
and ‘What Bird Is That?’ No, not
books. With Mrs. Johnson I talked
about clothes and diets and children.
She’s thorough, practical, sensible, she
doesn’t like gossip. She’s not malicious
at all. She’s a pen-and-pencil worker,


too. She’s, obsessed, as you know, with
a more beautiful America, she lectures
everywhere.”
How do they travel? “We either go
in our plane or Qantas. In America
we used the President’s plane.
“Mrs. Wilson? She’s pretty she’s
quiet, and doesn’t want to be a Prime
Minister’s wife. I talked to her about
children and flowers. He’s a clever man,
interested in history; I talked to him at
Chequers about a theory he had that
Shakespeare had visited there.
“Chequers has a ghost. A lady-in-
waiting to Queen Elizabeth who mar-
ried without royal permission and the
Queen locked her up in the attic at
Chequers. I looked at the girl’s por-
trait; and with my dressmaker’s eye I
saw she must have been a hunchback—
a cross face." In the U.S.: "I wouldn't want a White House for myself. .."
the ruff wasn’t a full one, only a half
ruff and I could tell about the back
from the cutting of the shoulders.
People have slept in her room and
thought they heard the door open and
creaks on the floor. Mrs. Wilson told
me that after the maid had done the
bed up she went up to put some prim-
roses in the room and when she came
down she said to the maid, ‘The bed’s
been sat on.’ And the maid said, ‘l’ve
just made the bed, and there s fresh
sheets on it, it hasn’t been touched.
But they both went up and the im-
pression on the cover was still there.”
Buckingham Palace she had found
fascinating, especially the marble
statues of Queen Victoria’s children on
the landings, with the boys carrying
telescopes and wearing sailor suits, and
the gills in bonnets and curls and
once again she had memorised every
detail, right down to the snuff-boxes
of the Tsar in the royal apartments.
Who were her closest friends over-
seas who would be known to the
Australian public. “Art Linkletter. He
is a very generous man. He worked
24 hours on a television show here to
help the hospitals. Robert Cummings
I like very much, too. He takes a
great variety of vitamin pills. He eats
his dinner with a dish of them in
front of him, and all the time he is
taking two purple ones or one green
one. He is, perhaps, 56 and he looks
40 or less.”
I asked her about her household.
“When I came into the Lodge it was
comfortable. It had a bookish, rather
intellectual atmosphere, but rather
bare, as the Menzies’ had taken their
own possessions away. But I really
had to start from scratch. The actual
refurnishing hasn’t cost much l’ve
used cotton curtains, you’ll notice. But
the structural changes have been ex-
pensive. I took a passageway out; it
divided up two reception-rooms and I
made it one room. You have to ask all
the diplomats if you have a party and
I wanted all the parliamentary wives.
And I couldn t then, I could only fit in
the Liberal and Country Party wives.
But now there’s room for everybody.
And I had to change the guest wing,
because the rooms were needed for
Joe Lyons’ children and so small the
wardrobes had to be kept in the cor-
ridor outside.
“The house was done by somebody
behind a desk, originally. They didn’t
have interior decorators in those days.
And I discovered an extraordinary
thing. Someone was forever polishing
the table silver plate. And I asked why,
and I found to my amazement that
there were full place settings for 150
people, with a dining-room that only
holds ten! And I said, ‘Hooray, let’s
sell it all, and get place settings for ten
of Australian sterling.’ But they said,
‘No, you can’t, because the plate’s got
PM engraved on it, and it can’t be
auctioned or sold.’ I’ve put 140 settings
of it down in a dry, warm place in-
stead.”
What about entertaining? “Mostly
official up here at The Lodge. Occa-
sionally I go around and play tennis at
various people’s houses. Every diplo-
mat’s wife calls to see me when she
arrives and when she leaves, even if
she’s only leaving for a short while,
And you can’t have two at once, that’s
frowned on, it’s not considered polite,
so each has to be seen separately. Mr.
Holt is usually at the House in the
evenings, so we have to say, if we have
a dinner party, come at a quarter to
seven because the PM has to be out of
t h e house by eight. Our closest per-
sonai friends are down in Melbourne,
and we go away at weekends whenever
we can . It’s essential so Harold can
get his exercise. At Portsea he’s either in
the water or on the golf links or on
the tennis court, hard at it all the
time. And he is as fit as a flea. Our
friends there aren’t politically minded,
they’re mostly business people, and
they’re all mad keen on being fit.”
Among her friends in Australia in


the art world, whom did she want to
mention? “Dobell, he’s a friend. I
greatly admire him. Len French I know
well, and Clifton Pugh. He comes down
to Portsea occasionally; he’s a mad-
keen underwater fan.”
Whom did she like to read? “Alan
Moorehead, he’s my favorite. The
Middle Eastern war books especially,
and ‘The White Nile’ and ‘The Blue
Nile.’ Cyril Pearl and Patrick White
so and so,” she said. Folding her
arms. “And you can see the whole
thing. The whole woman. I’m fascinated
by White’s construction of sentences. I
love the whole business of construction
of literature, you see. I love ‘Vanity
Fair.’ You remember the scene of the
Battle of Waterloo ball, and Amelia,
who is like one of Dickens’ heroines,
she’s such an idiot? Nasty Becky
Sharp’s dancing at the ball and having
a wonderful time, but Amelia is up in
her room praying for George, and at
the very end of the chapter you get the
sentence, ‘George lay dead with a bullet
through his heart.’ I still remember the
shock when I read that. You see it was
the brevity that amazed me. They used
to go on and on in those days and
here was this sharp sentence. And I
like Graham Greene and Truman
Capote.
“Poetry? No, I don’t know Judith
Wright, but I love poetry, and especi-
ally David Campbell’s work. He’s a
friend. I like to read the ‘Canberra
Times,’ ‘Time,’ and The Bulletin.
“I’m ignorant but emotional about
painting; but I love Dobell Len
French, Nolan, and Drysdale. Paintings
are difficult things, they’ve got to be
put in the right place in a room or you
can’t feel them or see them. And I love
Winterhalter, with his white tulle
dresses, and they all had waists no
matter what the woman’s age. Music?
I’m not knowledgeable. My mother
hated classical music because she was
forced to play the piano and sing as a
child. She’d only have to hear ‘O For
the Wings of a Dove’ and she’d go
berserk. By contrast, my father liked
Galli-Curci, etc. She’d have to go out
in the garden when he played his
records. So I’m very mixed about
music. I’d never go and buy a ticket
for a symphony concert, but when I
have gone to one I’ve been very
wrapped. I like modern music best.
I love the Beatles. And I like Judith
in the Seekers group.
“I don’t often watch television but
I’d like to see more historical works on
our own TV. And there are two films
I always remember. ‘Gate of Hell,’ that
Japanese film. I remember a girl in it
with a muslin hood running through
the rain, and her hair tied down with
"Laos is a sad country... but I loved the dancing and music... "
a piece of organza. And that opening
scene where you look at this great
screen of an ancient battle and suddenly
the painted flames start flickering. And
did you see ‘Odd Man Out’? Do you
remember when the fugitive is running,
and he hides in the junkyard, and
there’s an angel, and he hides behind
it underneath a bath, and when he gets
out at dawn and he’s nearly frozen
stiff it’s been raining, and the angel’s
got frozen tears? I was overwrought
about that film.”
Who were her great Australians? “Sir
William Hudson, Norman Brookes, who
put us on the map through tennis, and
Dame Mabel’s a great Australian, too,
because of her hospital work. Alan
Moorehead and Robert Helpmann, and
Sturt and Stuart the explorers.”
I asked her about her dress business,
and she said it was now entirely run
by her daughter-in-law, Caroline. “I
think about Magg in planes; I got a
wonderful idea for an embroidery once
by .catching the rain run down the
window pane of the plane, and we did
crystal runs with drops. But I can’t
run the firm now.”
She was, of course, concerned deeply
about the destruction of Australia’s
beauty. “I’m not at all happy about
this Rocks project. I used to drive
around there, and it’s so beautiful, those
wonderful walls and water seeping
down ferns, I’d hate to see that go.
I’d like a rule here that if you own
a house over a certain age you have
to apply before you can alter the out-
side. They ruin things you see a
whole row of beautiful terraces and
two of them have got glass louvres and
three-ply stuck across the front. We
must control things like this through
the National Trust.”
What about Australia’s future? “If
we keep our heads we haven’t got a
problem if' left to ourselves. We’re sen-
sible people, and if we can stay sen-
sible we’ve got everything going for
us. We’ve got the last, vast livable
piece of earth in the very beginning
of the Age of Science. And that’s a
miracle.”

FORUM
Aborigines:
The Wentworth Plan
Mr. Wentworth and friend... in Arnhem Land
Unless a national co-ordinating authority of some kind is set up this
month by the Federal Government to advance the position of
Aborigines, Mr. W. C. Wentworth (Lib., N.S.W.) has said he will
press for a parliamentary Select Committee to make a full-scale
investigation of the needs of Aboriginal people. We asked Mr. Went-
worth what he would do for the Aborigines if he had the power.
WORKING OUT a long-term policy
for the Aborigines obviously will re-
quire time, but these are two financial
measures which may be taken at
once;
A subsidy should be paid to the
States (in proportion to their total
expenditure upon Aboriginal welfare),
specifically for the expansion of their
program. The amount need not be
l ar g e a total of $2 million for the
current financial year should meet the
needs.
The newly responsible Minister
should have a small sum (say $1 mil-
lion) at his disposal during 1967-68,
to assist organisations and projects
directed toward Aboriginal welfare.
These measures would meet urgent
needs while the long-term policy is
being ‘worked out for implementation
during 1968-69 and subsequent years.
Among the things to be considered
for that long-term policy are the
following:
HOUSING. Those Aborigines living
in European communities should be
quickly given opportunity to obtain
houses of normal European standard.
Other Aborigines, who still live in re-
mote areas under “bush” conditions,
should be given transitional houses to
fit them as soon as possible for nor-
mal accommodation.
EDUCATION. Special efforts should
be made to give all Aboriginal child-
ren opportunities for normal educa-
tion, and to overcome their environ-
mental disabilities by such things as
homework centres. Scholarships in the
secondary and tertiary field should be
available to those who reach the neces-
sary standard. Funds should be pro-
vided for Adult Education purposes.
EMPLOYMENT. With the pro-
visions for equal pay, some dislocation
is unavoidable. Sympathetic admini-
stration can reduce this dislocation to
a minimum. In some cases a reasonable
plan of wage subsidy will be necessary
to enable a course to be steered be-
tween exploitation and unemployment,
OWNERSHIP. In the north of Aus-
tralia, there is ample land in the
Reserves to provide a full life for the
Aborigines who want it. Alienation of
this land should be prevented, and in
the transitional phase some kind of
group ownership by Aborigines should
be worked out. Inside this framework,
capital should be available to Aborigi-
nes for economic ventures. In the
unsettled parts of Australia, some
Aborigines can be assisted to acquire
normal businesses in the community,
In short, what is wanted is a bal-
anced policy of discrimination, not
against the Aboriginal people, but in
their favor. It is quite futile to regard
them just as “poor Whites,” who only
need the same opportunties as Euro-
peans. No doubt at some future time
this principle can be applied but
the time is not yet. If our Aboriginal
people are pushed out to sink or swim,
most of them will sink. This is not
through any inherent fault so much
as because of the accumulated weight
of environmental factors, which have
operated for generations against them
and are rooted in their old ways of
life, basically so different from ours,
Above everything, it is necessary to
re-create the Aboriginal concept of
authority among themselves. When the
European first came to Australia, he
found a set of tightly disciplined and
highly organised Aboriginal communi-
ties. That discipline and organisation
he proceeded to break down and treat
with contempt. As a consequence,
Aboriginals lost very largely the will
to live, because they felt that the
drives and motives of their life had
been taken away. The predictable
psychological consequences duly fol-
lowed.
It is thus essential to retrieve this
position by involving Aborigines as
soon as possible and as fully as pos-
sible in the decisions relating to their
own future and their own welfare.
Paternal care is necessary for them,
but too much paternalism will inevi-
tably send the whole process sour. The
essential middle course will always be
hard to find and generally impossible
to predict in advance.
It is too simple to speak of the
“Aboriginal Problem” to which there
must be a “solution.” In reality there
are many Aboriginal problems. The
measures which are appropriate for
Arnhem Land may be (almost cer-
tainly would be) quite inappropriate
for Central Queensland, let alone for
the considerable Aboriginal communi-
ties of Redfern or Footscray.
In the north it may still be possible
to retrieve some of the old tribal
organisation and build up on it in order
to reduce the traumas of the inevitable
transition to a new way of life. Else-
where, this approach seems generally
no longer available, and less satis-
factory alternatives may have to be
adopted. No universal rule can be
formulated in advance policy will
have to be worked out as development
proceeds.
Lessons, no doubt, can be learnt
from the Red Indians and the Maoris
but too much reliance should not
be placed upon these precedents. Our
Australian Aborigines are fundamen-
tally different from them, and their
problems cannot be solved in the same
way. Assimilation the merging of
the Aboriginal into the European com-
munity is no doubt the final out-
come, but in the meantime Integration
the development of the Aboriginal
upon equal terms without merging his-
separate identity seems a far more
acceptable goal.
There are still some legal discrimin-
ations against Aborigines, but they are
of minor importance. Nevertheless,
they should go, and no doubt the
Federal Government will exercise its
new powers to see that they go. The
real problems, however, are different
and less tractable, and it is here that
the development of a Federal policy
and example can help especially
if it is backed up by Federal finance.
An immediate start should be made
in the elaboration of a long-term plan.
Immediate resources should be made
available for a short-term plan. For
both purposes a responsible Minister
is needed here and now. A Select Fed-
eral Committee for which prece-
dents have already been set on the
level of the State Parliaments might
prove a good extra way of implement-
ing the popular will, so forcibly ex-
pressed at the May referendum.

Herr Issyvoo
in California
By CLEMENT HOLLIER
CHRISTOPHER ISHERWOOD’S
HOUSE stands high above the roman-
tic plunging slopes of Santa Monica
Canyon, looking down across a wilder-
ness of cactus and yucca and tangled
scrub past scattered red-roofed houses
to the broad, beating waves of the
Pacific. At the gate, two young people,
pale, pimply, black-clad, and patently
English, are consulting a road-map in
their Mini-Minor at the head of the
drive. Clearly, they have been visiting
Herr Issyvoo in his eyrie.
The house is modest: Spanish in
flavor, with low-lying couches, an
enormous coffee table, theatrical posters
on the white-painted walls. Isherwood
is informally dressed in open-necked
white shirt, black slacks, and slippers.
Against the deep Californian tan the
eyes glitter with a nervous brilliance,
blue and sharp, nervously darting like
a bird’s. He looks extraordinarily com-
pact and young, only a thin film of
age laid over the Issyvoo of the Ber-
lin drawings, and the voice, eager,
excited, sometimes strained, is the voice
of a boy.
Isherwood has lived in Santa Monica
or nearby for almost 30 years. Since
he came to Hollywood just before the
outbreak of World War 11, he has
written five novels: “Prater Violet,”
based on his experiences writing scripts
at Gaumont-British in England before
the war, “The World in the
“Down There on a Visit,” set res-
pectively wholly and partly in Holly-
wood, “A Single Man,” a story about
a homosexual professor in an American
college, and “A Meeting by the
River,” about the monastic vocation,
told in an epistolary form.
What were his methods of work? “I
write in spurts. Some days I work all
day long for hours and hours
and other times I realise, like an
unlucky angler, I’m not going to ‘catch
anything that day,’ so I switch to some
other job. I used to make endless notes
when I was young; now what I do is
write in a purely probing way; I do a
rough draft without knowing where I’m
going, and then rewrite it again and
again, re-doing every word. To be
specific, my latest novel ‘A Meeting by
the River’ was originally written straight,
not in the form of letters and diaries
as it is now. I was about 20 pages in
when I suddenly understood it wasn’t
going to work. So I changed the whole
structure. I wrote three complete
drafts.” In longhand? “No, straight
on to the machine. Luckily, I formed
that habit very early in life. Now I
couldn’t possibly write in longhand: I
have arthritis in both thumbs.”
How long, I asked him, does it take
him to write a book? “Anything up to
three years. And sometimes I can see
another book emerging from the one
I’ve written. ‘A Single Man,’ for
instance. I was fascinated by the charac-
ter of the English woman in that, the
woman who couldn’t settle in Califor-
nia. I’d like to write another novel
about her.
“Of course, settlement hasn’t been my
problem. I like the feeling of being
abroad. Now England seems just as
fascinating as America does. And they
both seem foreign.” If they both seem
foreign, what doesn’t? “I don’t know,
heaven I suppose.”
He talked about his attitudes to litera-
ture. “It really doesn’t matter what
you write. What really matters is what
you say. You can set up some kind of
plot, but it’s all really in aid of some-
thing you want to give voice to. Often
you don’t know what that is; it’s some-
thing instinctive, something in the un-
conscious. Whether it’s a novel or a
history of Charles II it might be the
medium by which you get certain things
said which you deeply want to say.”
Who are his idols? “Of course,
there’s Forster, the great master, whom
I come back to constantly. In an odd
way, Willa Cather, although she is a
totally different kind of writer. And
Henry Green, he’s a wonderful writer.
Edward Upward, of course; he’s just
finished the second volume of his tri-
logy, and it’s fascinating. Oddly enough,
I feel very drawn to Kerouac. There’s
something in his whole approach, the
way he wanders into the experience or
chain of experiences, and in his theme
of wanderlust itself. For the same rea-
son I love George Borrow and ‘Laven-
gro’.” What about the new experimental
French writers? The concrete novel? “I
find them absolutely unreadable. I al-
ways feel they’re writing films, not
novels. I’ll look at the damned thing
so long as you want if they photograph
it, but I don’t want to hear it named.”
I asked him how he came to settle
in California in the late ’thirties.
“Auden and I had written ‘Journey
to a War,’ based on our experiences in
the Orient, and we came back to Europe
by way of Canada and the States. We
made up our minds then that we would
live in the States. We were delayed
by the Munich crisis and we didn’t
leave finally until January, 1939.
“I chose California because I wanted
to meet Aldous Huxley, who had moved
out several years previously, and Gerald
Heard, whom I already knew. I had
been very curious, too, to see the West.”
Had it fulfilled his expectations? “I
was simply stunned by the classic West:
Yosemite and the Sequoia forests were
incredibly wonderful. Our first night
in Los Angeles was squalid a seedy
hotel after a long bus journey but I
soon came to love the city. Olive groves
everywhere, and the hills untouched
by bulldozers.”
How had he got into movies?
“Through Salka and Berthold Viertel,
the film director whose character
formed the basis of ‘Prater Violet.’ I
had worked on a script for him at
Gaumont-British in the early ’thirties:
‘Little Friend.’ ”
Salka Viertel’s salon in Los Angeles
was famous: to it came the great Euro-
pean expatriates who had settled in
California for the climate and the
possibility of film work: Thomas Mann,
Franz Werfel, Leonard Frank, Brecht;
and in addition to them Lotte Lehmann,
Fritzi Massary the great Berlin diseuse,
and Stravinsky. Huxley, Isherwood said,
had settled with unusual ease into Cali-
fornia. He had loved the terrain, the
desert, the wildflowers, and wrote
fascinating essays about them in “To-
morrow and Tomorrow.” “Huxley had
an enormous interest in everything that
went on around him. He was supremely
intelligent, and perhaps interest and
intelligence are really synonymous.
There was nothing he could relate to
the whole structure of his knowledge
and add a brick to the wall.”
Isherwood said he had worked on
“Rage in Heaven,” with Ingrid Berg-
man, “A Woman’s Face,” with Joan
Crawford, and “The Hour Before the
Dawn,” a story he had intended to be
a pacifist film but had wound up after
rewrites as a glorification of war. What
did he think about the theory that so
many writers were ruined by Holly-
wood? “It’s ridiculous. If you’re going
to be ruined you’re going to be ruined.
Something will come along and ruin
you if it can. I think it’s very good for
a writer to be forced to visualise. You
have to stop relying on the word and
start thinking in terms of images and
of possible silent sequences. And film
writing is of artistic value to me, no
doubt of it.”
He had written a good deal of the
script of “The Great Sinner,” a version
of Dostoevsky’s “The Gambler,” with
Ava Gardner, and Gregory Peck, of
all people, as Dostoevsky. “I remember
one thing that happened on the produc-
tion. The voice of Christ had to speak
from the crucifix in the church when
Gregory Peck robs the poor box. They
asked me to do it. They said: ‘To make
them words reverberate, Chris, you

should speak the lines in a little con-
crete entrance hall.’ There I was in
the hall clutching the mike, and I had
to produce this terrible booming voice.
Suddenly a door opened, just as a red
light went on indicating I should
deliver the speech, and a carpenter
came in. There was nothing to be done,
I had to go on, they had the whole
thing wired for sound. So I looked
him right in the eye, and I said as
loudly as my lungs could manage, with
every word echoing round the room,
‘And they parted my garments among
them, and they cast dice for my robe!’
I’ve never seen anyone as frightened in
my life!”
Isherwood’s next project, never
filmed, had been a life of Buddha. “The
whole thing was predicated on a very
simple dramatic base: would or would
not the prophecy that Buddha would be-
come a monk, that he would renounce
the throne, be fulfilled? We didn’t
have anything about the enlightened
Buddha, because that isn’t allowed to
be shown in Buddhist countries. We
showed the young prince growing up,
in a barbaric Gordon Craig type of
castle with a sort of Alice in Wonder-
land little door in the back, guarded
by two tremendous men, one with a
sword in his teeth and another with a
sword in each hand.
“When you went through this door
you came to a marvellous pleasure park,
where everything was very Chinese with
little hills and peacocks and ivory
pagodas. And here the young Prince
lived with his companions and girl-
friends.
On the film version, directed by Tony
Richardson, of “The Loved One,”
Isherwood said he had written the
scene in the chapel when the wedding
becomes the funeral, and the board-
meeting sequence; most of the rest of
his work on the film had been recast
by Terry Southern. He had never met
Waugh in California, or elsewhere, and
winced at mention of his name. “I
didn’t like the book. The ending isn’t
at all resolved, and, in fact, you couldn’t
have shot it as it stood, it didn’t amount
to anything. The hero is such a boring
kind of heel that it’s all rather dis-
tasteful. And snobbish. And to laugh
at Forest Lawn seemed so trivial, so
obvious, and so thin a reason for con-
demning the whole of Californian life.”
How did he feel about Swinging
Britain now that he had just revisited
it? “I love the Mod thing. I was given
a kind of Press conference when I was
last there recently. They started asking
the usual questions about England
how did I feel about it, and so on. And
I said, ‘I think it’s just ideal. In other
words everything that I hoped would
happen to England when I was young
has happened.’ And somebody said,
‘Oh, you mean the total destruction of
England.’ And I said, ‘No! Not at all,
you’re quite wrong, you don’t under-
stand!’ England today is a marvellous,
marvellous place.”


Awaiting
Developments
ONE AMERICAN importation which
Australia doesn’t quite know what to
do with is the terminology uptown and
downtown. In Sydney it used to be the
north and the south end of the city,
or the railway and the harbor end.
Very simple and straightforward. How-
ever, now that there is an Uptown
Sydney Development Committee “up-
town” is generally referred to as the
dead end of Sydney.
In New York you might take uptown
as far as Harlem, but the accepted area
does contain the Lincoln Center, the
Metropolitan Museum of Art, Central
Park; in Sydney it suggests a grubby
melange of cheap hotels, brothels, pin-
ball parlors, the hideous cheese-colored
wedge of the Dental Hospital, the
Eastern Suburbs Railway hole, like the
entry point of a Jules Verne adventure,
the faded Douglas Fairbanks-in-a-
Robin-Hood-Castle charm of the Capi-
tol Theatre, the mirrors and laminex
cafe tables, bare and antiseptic, of
Chinatown, and, on weekends, the
Salvation Army groups huddled to-
gether on street corners with their
brave music and scrubbed monastic
faces under caps and bonnets.
It all has a violent, crude color and
vigor at night, and the developers and
city dreamers have long had their
sights on it, determined to turn it into
a kind of Canberra, with parks and
suave apartment blocks and offices, all
framed elegantly (and a trifle life-
lessly?) around some grand, central
design. A prime mover was Anthony
Horderns’, worried about the compe-
tition from other areas, feeling its blood
drain away as fewer and fewer people
came uptown to shop; a new Horderns’
Tower was planned with English
finance, but Wilson’s squeeze in Eng-
land forced the abandonment of the
scheme. Four years ago, Frank Munro,
managing director of Horderns’, and
Ernest Merrington, an optician, formed
the Uptown Sydney Development Com-
mittee with the aid of George Hawkes
(a public-relations man who later
became the committee’s head) to
eliminate the two-section city bus fare,
get rid of prostitutes, move the markets
to Flemington, develop flats combined
with shops in the same blocks, open a
subway station at Liverpool and Pitt,
and move Sydney Hospital to the mar-
kets area.
Harry Seidler and lan McCloy,
among other architects, showed interest,
but the SCC put the scheme firmly on
the shelf. Financiers failed to act,
chiefly, according to Hawkes, because
no one would make a first move: each
was timidly waiting for the others to do
something. Askin did abolish the
two-section bus fare but “was too pre-
occupied by the drought” (Hawkes) to
do anything else. The public’s apathy
was total, and when property owners
uptown were approached to help finance
a redevelopment scheme, only six replies
and 160 dollars were received by the
committee.
In the meantime, Bebarfalds went out
of business, 11 smaller retail firms
closed, and Horderns’ lost $1,500,000 in
trade.
We asked D. McK. McLachlan, prin-
cipal planning officer of the Sydney
County Council, what he thought of
Hawkes’ plan, and he shook his head.
He passed across a copy of Jane Jacobs’
“The Death and Life of Great Ameri-
can Cities,” a book in which city
planning is firmly rejected on the ground
that it results in dull uniformity, a regi-
mented mediocrity. McLachlan: “Be-
sides agreeing with her, I’m not a Hit-
ler or a Mussolini. I can’t uproot the
Water Board, the Police Courts, the
AMP people, the churches, the banks,
and the Real Estate Institute, can I?
“I believe people should be masters
of their own land holdings. Australians
regard property as sacrosanct, you can’t
just force people out because of an
overall scheme. It’s no good putting
Paris-type cafes in George Street, Aus-
tralians won’t go out at night and sit
there. They want to go home.
“Of course, we must get rid of the
vice. So august a body as the United
Grand Lodge of Masons recently found
they had brothels on their properties in
the area. And there are plenty of Muf-
fled Drums there. Do you know what
they are? Brothels with wall-to-wall
carpets.”
Parks such as the developers want
would, McLachlan believes, bring more
violence to the area. As Central Park
drew hoodlums, so would these. He
bitterly attacked the new Manhattan
developments, grim barracks of apart-
ments stretching for miles between Ken-
nedy Airport and the city. But he
wanted a new Sports Centre built in
the Capitol/Manning House site, to
combine swimming and squash facili-
ties, and said this was very much on
the cards.
Perhaps the most energetic oppon-
ent of thinking like McLachlan’s is
Lyndsay Shaddock, of Construction
and Development, which is building
Pulsing by day and night
the Crest Hotel project at Kings Cross
and almost pulled off the 9.5-million-
dollar Tivoli/Hotel Sydney scheme.
Shaddock described attitudes like
McLachlan’s as “apathetic” and said
that a grand scheme for the whole of
Sydney was essential to stir public and
civic interest, not merely a scheme for
any one area. He said that the Civic
Reform Association is preparing such
a scheme and that there will be an
exhibition of the plans at the Crest
Hotel when it opens this month.
Shaddock thinks that the blocks of
flats he and his colleagues envisage for
North Sydney will bring life and color
to the city; McLachlan thinks they will
bring in a flow of old people who won’t
have the necessary buying power. Shad-
dock thinks young unmarried people
and young married couples will move
there instead, but admits the money
problem could present a difficulty.
Among those who have worked out
concrete plans for Uptown Sydney as
part of an overall Sydney plan are
the students of the Universities of
N.S.W. and Sydney (as parts of Honors
courses) and Michael Pomeroy Smith,
an architect, in business for himself.
But the fact remains that at present the
public has no clear idea of what Up-
town Sydney can be like: it hasn’t yet
been fired by the idea, as it was by the
Opera House concept and The Rocks
plan.
Shaddock believes that the only solu-
tion is for one man perhaps an
architect and for another in the City
Council to get together and form a
new redevelopment committee more ex-
tensive than Hawkes’ which can devote
itself to stirring the public and to
drawing to the colors financiers,
developers, major property owners in
the area, and civic leaders. Together
with a panel of architects, these people
would agree to an absolutely firm Syd-
ney plan which they would then public-
ise at considerable expense with exhi-
bitions and Press features. It sounds
stimulating, but the fact remains that
the whole idea is still a pipe-dream.
And, meanwhile, old Uptown goes on
seedily, squalidly, and (dare one say?)
engagingly pulsing by day and night.


OVERSEAS
Is China
breaking up?
THE WORLD’S BIGGEST' nation is
disintegrating into bits and pieces. The
bits may come together again, but many
China-watchers now agree that China
may be dissolving into chaos. It cer-
tainly seems clear that as things stand
now the Peking Government controls
only those parts of China that are
closest to it. Most of the South and
the South-West and most of the North-
East and North-West are falling into
local rule. It is only in parts of Cen-
tral China and East China that the
decisions of Peking still have effect.
Elsewhere provincial and regional
leaders are taking over, as they always
have in times of disorder in China.
There is confusion in South China,
where there is talk of dividing China
in two. In the South-West provincial
leaders are making their own rules.
Manchuria’s turmoil is so great that
production is now impeded in the in-
dustrial centre of China. Even in Peking
still more or less outwardly calm
such bitter factionalism divides the
Ministries and in particular the
Foreign Ministry that it is impossible
to guess at the meaning of some Gov-
ernment pronouncements.
In other parts of the country fac-
tories stop work because raw materials
do not arrive or because workers go
on strike. Some train services have
been cancelled. The turnaround of
shipping is sometimes delayed by sev-
eral months. The political art of kid-
napping has been revived, as provincial
leaders siege emissaries of Peking. Even
Chou En Lai was almost kidnapped re-
cently. When he tried to go to Canton
to speak to provincial leaders there they
refused his aircraft permission to land.
Despite counter measures and vic-
tories claimed by the Maoists, the
familiar pattern of violence continues
to convulse province after province
in a chain reaction of defiance of Chair-
man Mao, who is unable to eliminate
the roots of disruption and rebellion:
factionalism among the mass organi-
sations, deep-seated grievances among
the workers, and the re-emergence of
local criminal elements.
From Canton, where last week hordes
of refugees from the fighting were re-
ported trying to reach Hong Kong, 60
miles away, and two Chinese army
battalions were positioned to stop them,
arrivals in the Crown Colony gave an
even more ominous picture of disorder
and distress. Bodies, clothed only in
underwear, dangled from trees and
lamp-posts, most of them the victims
of fighting between rival Maoist
factions.
Before the worst of last week’s Can-
ton disorder was brought under con-
trol, the situation gave local criminal
elements an open go, and there were
widespread reports of theft, plunder,
and murder. Even before a curfew was
imposed, the city was dead after sunset.
The disintegration of political control
in the city —and thus lack of central
control over the Kwangtung Province
—undoubtedly goes far to explain the
excesses on the border with Hong Kong.
Amid this new belligerence across its
borders, and the rising civil turbulence
within them, China’s official propa-
gandists spend their time dwelling on
the past rather than the present in
Red guards... on the march for Mao, in Canton
editorials commemorating various anni-
versaries of Mao’s rule.
But the real inconclusiveness of the
political situation was clear. from the
two-way flavor in all references to the
“handful of top party people taking the
capitalist road.” Although these people
had been overthrown, the Maoists
claimed, they continued to wield politi-
cal and ideological power.
It is 12 months since Mao T'se Tung
attempted to boot his chief-comrade-
turned-arch-enemy, Liu Shao Chi, out
of the cultural revolution. Liu has been
demoted, has lost his functions as head
of State, and been accused of every
crime in the Maoist book. Mao has
tried and failed to whip up a new cam-
paign of nation-wide indignation at
“China’s Khrushchev.” Red Guards ex-
tracted Liu’s third self-criticism and re-
jected it for the third time as a “con-
fession” in form but counter-attack in
essence. It was all too familiar. It has
gone on too long. Despite a year of
assault, Liu Shao Chi remains power-
ful.
In a nutshell, Liu is accused of hav-

ing opposed Mao on every important
policy issue since the early 19205. And
at every point Liu is said to have erred
in the direction of a softer and less
revolutionary line. After the war with
Japan, he is quoted as urging accom-
modation with the Nationalists and
“peaceful and parliamentary struggle”
rather than persevering with the civil
war. In the early years of communist
rule he is reported to have preached
the virtues of capitalism —“in China
there is not too much capitalism but too
little” —and to have asserted that “it
will be a very long time before China
takes really serious socialist steps.” And
through the “three bitter years” after
the Great Leap Forward and right up
in 1959 his opposition to Mao is said
to have reached the level of a plot to
seize the leadership. From then on,
to the cultural revolution, Liu and Mao
were moving on a collision course. The
crash came a year ago. when Mao re-
moved Liu from his position as heir-
designate and party leader number two
and replaced him with Lin Pao.
It might take another year to evalu-
ate the charges against Liu; or it might
be impossible to do so, since many of
the vital documents are still classified
in Peking. A number of Liu’s public
statements which are now under attack
appeared at the time to be straight-
forward expressions of the current Party
line and therefore of the views of Mao
Tse Tung as well. What the recent
evidence suggests, however, is that there
may have been a series of intra-party
disputes in which Liu at least tempor-
arily carried a majority against Mao.
On the issue of agricultural collec-
tivisation, for example, it seems fairly
certain that Mao was unhappy from
the start with the gradualist approach
that was adopted in 1949. It was on
Mao’s personal intervention in 1955
that the pace was rapidly speeded up
and widespread collectivisation achieved
within a couple of years. Mao inter-
vened again in 1958 with his crash
program of the Great Leap Forward.
There is no evidence that Liu Shao
Chi opposed either rapid collectivisation
or the leap after Mao had decided on
it. But it may well be that he remained
an advocate of the gradualist method.
And after the failure of the leap he
seems to have been one of the many
party pragmatists who acknowledged
that the catastrophe was “three parts
natural calamities and seven parts man-
made disasters,” and so advocated a
strategic retreat.
Biographers of Liu and Mao have
always stressed their differences in
temperament: Liu the stern and disci-
plined organisation man who built up
the party machine and believed in it as
the basis of communist power; Mao
the revolutionary romantic who be-
lieved that revolution was made of
ceaseless struggle and the militant spirit
of the masses. But despite their obvious

differences it is impossible to believe
that Liu could have opposed Mao con-
sistently for 20 years and still have been
his choice as right-hand man in 1945
and as head of state in 1959.
What is more likely is that the policy
arguments during the revolutionary
years and right up until 1959 were
within the limits of acceptable disagree-
ment among a cohesive group of com-
rades. But in 1959 Mao discovered an
“anti-party clique” headed by his de-
fence minister, Peng Teh Huai; behind
it, it is now said, stood Liu. After 1959
Mao began to become obsessed with
the “restoration of capitalism” in the
Soviet Union and its implications for
China, and his paranoid tendencies
grew full-blown. And as Liu and other
leaders viewed the calamities that
Maoist policies had caused they began
to oppose the old man outright.
Among the points of dispute in these
years, according to this latest revela-
tion, were Liu’s support for improving
relations with America as well as with
Russia, and for continuing co-operation
with those bourgeois nationalist leaders
Sukarno and Ne Win. As might have
been expected, China’s setback in Indo-
nesia and the recent one in Burma have
both been blamed on Liu.
So the evidence against Liu mounts
up. But Mao still holds back from a
final confrontation. It becomes more
and more apparent that Mao must be
clinging to the unregenerate Liu as the
one nation-wide focus for his cultural
revolution campaign. Without him,
the present disintegration might be-
come a series of civil wars.
The Philippines
"bari-sari"
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER in a
typical Philippines town or village buys
his daily necessities from a Chinese
corner store which has always been
called a “sari-sari” (miscellaneous)
store. Members of Congress who 13
years ago voted for “Filipinising”
retail trade or legislating foreigners out
of it have far from forgotten the real
purpose of Congress in approving the
law. It was to place in exclusively Fili-
pino hands the “sari-sari” store busi-
ness, which involves essentially the
retail sale of goods direct to the con-
sumer. This purpose was made abun-
dantly clear in the lively debate which
preceded passage of the law. The
President, then Congressman Ferdinand
E. Marcos, participated actively in that
debate. He supported the proposal, but
there was little doubt that he, like his
colleagues in Congress, was under the
impression the law would Filipinise

only the retail or “sari-sari” store busi-
ness.
Not very long after the law’s pas-
sage, many in the Government, who
must have been aware of the real in-
tent of the measure, either forgot the
original purpose of the legislation or
chose to be vague or technical in their
interpretation of the law. Thus, the
Secretary of Justice during the previous
administration (that of President Mac-
apagal) interpreted the law as refer-
ring to all direct sales to end-users,
regardless of the quantity or nature
of the goods involved.
Earlier this year, Judge Hilarioh
Jarencio, ruling on a test case filed by
an American company, handed down
a decision that was even more sweep-
ing than previous interpretations by
the Department of Justice. He said that
Americans engaged in bulk sales of
their products to industrial and other
direct consumers were retailing and
therefore not entitled to do business
under the Retail Trade Nationalisation
Law; and there was nothing in the
Constitution that stated Americans were
exempt from the provisions of the
Retail Trade Act.
Now comes another court ruling by
Judge Luis Reyes who takes a con-
trary view of the law and in effect
assails the Jarencio decision. Reyes in
a 20-page decision released recently
stated clearly that bulk sales are not
covered by the law. He has limited the
scope of the law to small “sari-sari”
stores selling goods for personal and
household consumption.
Members of the Chamber of Filipino
Retailers are up in arms. They were
overjoyed by the Jarencio decision and
so are now flabbergasted by the Reyes
ruling. They are seeking reconsideration
of the latest decision to make it harmo-
nise with their own position.

vinces, and the use of local officials to
boost the ticket on which General
Thieu and Marshal Ky are running for
the presidency and vice-presidency.
Huong claimed that some soldiers
were getting two voting cards, one at
their unit and the other at their home
address. Even more sensational were the
charges from another presidential candi-
date, lawyer Truong Dinh Dzu. At a
joint Press conference by all candi-
dates, which was broadcast live, Dzu
described in detail a banquet in a
palace of ex-Emperor Bao Dai in
Dalat at which Marshal Ky allegedly
told the nation’s assembled police and
military security chiefs to get the
Thieu-Ky ticket elected.
Dzu is one of Saigon’s slickest and
most controversial lawyers. In the
labyrinth of Vietnamese politics it is
exceedingly hard to determine what, or
perhaps more exactly whose, game he
is playing.
Admittedly not all the candidates
are taking his line. Dr. Phan Quant
Dan the running-mate of another
chief civilian hopeful, ex-President Phan
Khac Suu has declared the elec-
tions to be far freer than others South
Vietnam has known. A cynical expla-
nation would be that the freedom al-
lowed the candidates to sound off, and
the lifting of Press censorship were
minimum requirements if the generals
were to avoid a major rumpus with
the Americans.
Certainly one of the problems is that
the soldiers are divided among them-
selves. “The generals inhabit a sort of
Fourth Republic of their own,” a
prominent civilian supporter of Mar-
shal Ky remarked recently. Above all,
no one can forecast how the Thieu-Ky
partnership will develop. Ominously,
people in the know in Saigon were say-
ing right up to election eve that there
was no sign of diminishing hostility be-
tween the powerful entourages of the
two generals.
It is wrong to suppose that all this
fuss was inevitable. There was originally
never any question that Tran Van
Huong, for example, recognised the
need to work closely with the armed
forces if he was elected. It was openly
Saigon ... peddling a viewpoint
suggested by his aides that he could get
along very well with General Thieu.
On the other side of the coin, the
American hope that an elected military
ticket would choose one of the promi-
nent civilian candidates as its Prime
Minister also looked realistic. But
Huong made it plain that even if the
generals’ tactics allowed him to stay in
the campaign which was in doubt
he would not, if elected, be Prime
Minister for Thieu and Ky.
Nor did this just mean that Huong
would be lost to his country. His fol-
lowers, who represent a most impor-
tant group of southern middle-class
intellectuals, would remain alienated, as
they are now, from the Saigon Govern-
ment.
Huong, a former premier, is widely
respected by Vietnamese and Americans
alike. In all respects his record is good.
He was a notable resistance fighter, and
even with a new and worse war on
their hands, the Vietnamese still esteem
their leaders in the fight for freedom
from France.
In numbers, Huong has the strongest
party organisation, but his resources are
no match for the “machine” of the
military. A further complication is that
though Ky is now out of the front
running, it is really his machine, not
General Thieu’s, because Ky has been
running the administration, and also
is richer than Thieu.
Many Ky supporters were reluctant
to work to put Thieu into the top job
knowing he would take his own men
into the regime with him, and the Ky
boys’ days of grace and favor would be
over. It was not surprising, in this situ-
ation, that the Thieu-Ky partnership
was constantly said to be breaking
down, and the possibility of a few
double-cross alliances was still being
openly canvassed in the closing days of
the campaigning.
One of the problems is that the sort
of election techniques that are viable in
South Vietnam are almost bound to
favor the Government, with its far
greater resources in influence, money,
and men. The most effective way to
approach the peasant voter is through
his “leader” —the head of a religious
sect, the boss of one of the old nationa-
list political parties, or, where there are
no such independent leaders, through
the province and district chiefs, who are
the most important authorities in the
peasants’ lives.
Since both the sects and the political
parties are invariably split into two or
more rival factions, the temptation for
the leaders to offer votes to the most
attractive bidder, like the old American
political bosses, is pretty big.
It may well have been a mistake for
the Americans to think that the elections
could be represented to Western opinion
as anything else than a pretty rough-
and-ready operation. The odd thing is
that some of the Military Government’s
supporters seem to care very little that
they are making Washington’s job
harder.

ENTERTAINMENT
The hard road to the top
By CHARLES HIGHAM
“I’M GOING to kill Norman Kessell!”
In the lift at the Chevron, Sydney,
frowning fiercely over Kessell’s review
of her performance at Chequers, Lana
Cantrell looked as though she meant
it. He had suggested that there was
something cold, something insufficiently
emotional about her performance. And
there was; she will have to kill me, too.
The professionalism, the high degree of
expertness she has learned in the States
hasn’t been accompanied, as yet, by any
corresponding warmth or passion.
Tough and challenging in a Garbo-
esque dress on stage or leggily akimbo
in Twiggy mini-tweeds and schoolgirl-
grey stockings off, Lana Cantrell is
almost wholly unrecognisable compared
with the soft, dark, suburban girl who
peers over the top of a piano in old
stills of Brian Henderson’s “Band-
stand.” How had she achieved the trans-
formation? “Aurally by constant work,
which is the only way you can develop
Cantrell ... absolutely horrendous
a muscle, and that’s what a vocal
cord is. Visually, as well, I had to take
something which was in Australia very
raw and very rough and see what would
happen to it.
“When I was working the Playboy
Club circuit I went to a hairdresser in
Detroit to get my hair done. The girl
who was cutting it said it was the most
atrocious looking thing she’d ever seen,
and she cut it all off. She started this
Vidal Sassoon thing with me and
finally Vidal Sassoon himself started
cutting my hair. You see, there was
nobody in Australia that would ever
grab me and say, ‘Oh, please, you look
absolutely horrendous’ and start doing
something with me. They just didn’t
have the initiative.
“The same with dress. I was told by
a friend in New York that I looked
dreadful and then I was made over.
Today, the Allen and Cole Boutique
in New York do all my clothes.” She
hadn’t, however, let an agency take over
her act, buy a routine and set it up for
her as was done for so many stars, with
every line of patter and every song
scripted and rehearsed; the numbers
and dialogue were her own choice and
she used her manager as a sounding-
board for ideas.
She had spent her first year in the
States —after a successful period here
on “Bandstand” and other television
shows studying nightclub and TV
productions. (“You have no idea what’s
going on in the States if you come
from Australia. Everything here is
three seasons old.”) So she watched
and watched, and finally worked out
her own highly individual act. A TV
appearance in Little Rock had led to a
chance at the Playboy Circuit, and
Hugh Hefner had become a close
friend.
She was out in New York one night
with her manager when a man joined
the party; he turned out to own the
Cocoanut Grove in Los Angeles. She
was hired to sing there (“It was just
like playing in a sandbox”) and got
rave reviews, played the Sands at Las
Vegas, with Joey Bishop on a double
bill, the Copacabana, and then Miami.
At opening night at the Copa, she had
stolen the show from the star, Jackie
Leonard, whose nose was badly put out
of joint by her success. (“He said he’d
never work with me again, and he
hasn’t. And today the main reason is
that he’d have to open for me now, in-
stead of the other way round.”)
She had become used, since living
in New York, to having only three
hours’ sleep a night. Apart from batt-
ling with co-performers on the shows,
she had to fight for the record covers
she wanted, and, in the early stages,
over lighting. She had replaced the
recording company’s arranger with one
of her own, after a battle. She had
worked out a complete lighting sheet
of her own, and had learned the tech-
niques thoroughly.
“If someone hired me to work a
club there’s no way they’re going to
upset me. I’m the star and I have to
do the lighting myself. At the begin-
ning of my show the room has to be
pitch black, every light out, and one
light on the mike. For ballads I use
cross lighting and back lighting, for
fast numbers a high light and a follow
spot, and in one number I use just one
blue light that’s right over my head. It
creates the right mood.”
She had seemed, in some interviews,
bitter about Australia. Was she? “The
Australian Press has a name for itself
all over the world for being ready to
pounce; they would rather goad than
be nice. I was nervous about confront-
ing them, and I resent the fact that I
had to feel this way about coming
home. I’m the only person to have
gone from here and done anything in
my area and I’m upset that I had to
be worried about the way things would
be here after coming back. Luckily, I
haven’t had the Press at me so much
now, because they’ve been on strike.
But somebody did send me a review
somebody wrote in one of the suburban
papers and I could have killed the guy.
He said it must have been difficult
for me to follow Liza Minnelli. Of
course, he added, I didn’t manage to
follow her. And I felt this kind of
sentiment very strongly here. The
people here hadn’t seen me before in
a club and they’d just seen Liza, and
they all felt I’d fall flat on my face.”
Apart from the Press, she was far
from satisfied with the standards of
entertainment in Australia generally.
“It’s very difficult for an Australian
performer to ever get to the level of
Americans because there’s nowhere for
them to work. You’re never going to
headline at Chequers, because you
can’t get the training to be good
enough. It took me 18 months of con-
stant work in the States to get to that
kind of level. The RSL clubs may
eventually provide the kind of train-
ing ground the Playboy circuits give
in America. I hope so.”
She had reached a tricky stage in
her career, she was big but not really
“on top.” How could she bridge the
gap? “Yes, well, as you say, I’m in
a difficult area. And other girls in that
area, who were playing Vegas at the
same time I was, gave me a good deal
of viciousness. Now to get further I’ve
got to have a hit record or a hit Broad-
way musical. Once I get the musical,
and it runs, I’ve bridged a gap, I can
do anything I want. At present there’s
a possibility I may do a version, set
to music, of the early life of Queen
Victoria. Or a kookie, fast-moving
farce. My manager and I were driving
round Buckingham Palace recently and
we saw a statue of Queen Victoria and
he looked at me and said, ‘Who’s
kidding? Cancel the play’.”

We launched our safety campaign for two
reasons. Firstly, we were convinced that we
had a responsibility to promote safety rather
than speed.
Secondly, we believed that motorists would,
in the long run, prefer to patronise service
stations which offered them safety service,
along with quality products,

So far it’s working out well.

Art
Form and feeling
By ELWYN LYNN
Danila Vassilieff. Strines Gallery, Mel-
bourne.
William Peascod. Stern’s Gallery, Syd-
ney.
Ignacio Marmol. Rudy Komon Gallery,
Sydney.
Survey 7. Blaxland Gallery, Sydney.
AUSTRALIA has seen so much hard-
edge painting lately that there must
seem to many a dichotomy between the
sensuous and the analytic, between
the art of wide psychological associ-
ations and that reduced to basic forms
and material. But no Australian sculp-
tor has combined sensuous, organic
movements with a severe and formal
economy as the scandalously neglected
Vassilieff, who carries this seeming
dichotomy to the very surface of his
Lilydale limestone, hard and shiny, but
softly mottled. His amalgam of the
sensuous and the formal has, in Yankee
Caesar, a kinship with pre-Columbian
art, and in his dark grey Three Forms,
with Mayan solidity, but it is his own
powerful expressiveness contending with
the stony formal qualities that gives
each work an individual presence.
This expressiveness, curiously set
against formal qualities, is more riot-
ously evident in the vivid, lambent
watercolors that he did of the Darling
River which must flow past the Ger-
man towns of Kirchner and Molde into
the Danube. They have, however, a
folk-art directness and unsophisticated
urgency that set them apart from
Ensor or Nolde. Just as he balances
distorted heads against geometrical
shapes, he contrasts child-like immedi-
acy with the double-take of adjust-
ing oneself visually and emotionally to
a head with three noses and two eyes.
Despite the connections between the
watercolors and sculpture, no one could
have predicted that about 1954 (he died
in 1958) he would be carving a reclin-
ing female form in a tender pink-grey
stone where the limbs are limply taut
and both nobly flowing and abruptly
arrested. Quite different are the im-
pacted masses of Mechanical Man,
where the legs of mottled stone seem to
shift under the simple solidity. Inciden-
tally, what decoration appears seems to
me to be no mere additive but part of
his direct, intuitive inventiveness and no
wonder John Reed, Joy Hester, Basil
Burdett, Tucker, and Arthur Boyd have
attested to his impact. It’s a pity that
his works are not more readily acces-
sible to our sculptors.
Bill Peascod, who had been tending
toward a polite delicacy, is now brutally
sensuous; if Vassilieff has forms flowing
in ingenious delight, Peascod employs
an anti-formal rough-and-ready place-
ment with slabs of blackened wood on
grim, grey texture, a grey harpoon of
wood floating on a white, curdled sea
in Shroud, and a shadowed, horizontal
fawn beach athwart a sea of frozen greys
and whites in Bar. The movement in
these works, especially Netherlith, is
quiet, almost imperceptible, and Crom-
lech, like a worn headstone, epitomises
his feeling for the crumbling, wan, and
sensuous atmosphere. Even when he uses
a dark red the tone is muted and secre-
tive, for, unlike Tapies, he uses textures
to create atmosphere rather than to show
art in creation amid lava flows, fissures,
and incisions. Despite the roughness
there is an air of frailty, and where Jan
Riske’s thick pastes parallel the turbu-
lence of a Charybdis, Peascod’s have
the steady stillness of Scylla. For Peas-
cod, in this intriguing/show, the battles
are done and the myths take over the
worn terrain.
Ignacio Marmol, another texture
painter, works as though the walls of
Lascaux were the crossroads of culture,
for on his sooty surfaces there are not
only primitive figures, some like those
of the Bushmen and Eskimoes, but also
some like Paul Klee’s; Chinese ideo-

grams also join the cultural corrobo-
ree. The light touch in his drawings,
their use of cabbalistic signs imposed
on, as it were, faded medieval manu-
scripts, cubist flat patterns, and Chinese
calligraphic whimsies make me wonder
whether there is a cultural war, with-
out much fire and thunder, in Marmol
himself. This results in a certain
preciousness and a use of texture for
pleasant variation. This limits the im-
pact of his large Birth of the Flower
Children (98in. by 144 in.), where the
fine incisive and embracing rhythms
look imposed rather than a natural
growth of his textures. In their decor-
ative affectations such works have a
little of late nineteenth century Chinoi-
serie and Moreau’s cloying symbolism.
Marmol has a dry, stark side and
when he opts for the magisterial slabs
that we associate with the Spanish
school as in Bullima, Avila, and Castilla-
Mora we see the difference between
textural titillation and art’s arising from
its sensuous, curdled matiere. But too
often his interests are so divergent that
his eclecticism has little thematic
cohesion.
One could hardly expect a theme in
the Blaxland Gallery’s seventh “Survey,”
which gives us a glimpse of some facets
of the art world and shows us how
formal qualities can rout the sensuous,
for in his treatment of the begirdled,
skirtless, Peeping-Tom bodiced girls
created by Allen Jones, who can get
sensuality out of the most alabaster
upper thigh —that area revered as age-
less by the English critic and ccnnoisseur,
Robert Melville —Alan Oldfield reduces
the parts of the body to flat collage
areas; the anatomy is fine but the physio-
logy’s not turned on. Louis James in
Down Town, where a scurry of black
and white formalised people pause be-
fore a palimpsest of stencilled public
notices, shows how a coolly analytic
painting can be made to skip.
The skipping is over with Roy Jack-
son’s jellied bodies, decrepit relatives of
Bacon’s, becoming mounds of meat as
though in ironic commentary on sen-
suality and the vanity of the flesh; yet
they remain turgid lumps and like the
color (which is sometimes aesthetically
horrid) are horridly horrid. One won-
ders whether the influence of recent
English art has been good: Certainly
the good taste, limpness, lack of formal
intensity and of sensuous pleasure of
the lesser modern English artists appears
to be debilitating Robert Williams and
Michael Taylor. One would like, too,
the over-elaborated vaporousness of
Daryl Hill’s works to solidify as it does
in Salkaukas’ Painting I, where , a deli-
cate wash muffles the clash between two
black, compact forms. His balance of
frail sensuousness against a sombre for-
mality reminds us both of Vassilieff’s
formal sensuousness and the fact that
each artist came from countries familiar
with iconic expressiveness.
Music
Unexpected heights
By PAUL FROLICH
Rudolph Firkusny, pianist. Town Hall,
Sydney.
A RECITAL by Czech pianist Rudolf
Firkusny, touring for the ABC, turned
into one of the season’s richest musical
experiences. I heard Firkusny in 1937
and again in 1959, during his first Aus-
tralian tour. On these occasions, and
also on records, he impressed me as a
musicianly player of considerable skill,
but I would not have described him as
one of the world’s great. His develop-
ment during this past decade must have
been quite remarkable, for his musical
insight has deepened to a rare degree
and his pianistic skill, far from flagging,
is now reaching unexpected heights.
The program was intelligent, no part
of it less than interesting; however,
Schubert’s great B-flat major Sonata,
his last one, was an experience far be-
yond the average. This sonata, Schu-
bert’s pianistic farewell, is less episodic
than his others. Firkusny’s playing of
the enormous first movement, which is
both profuse and profound, was a single,
drawn-out thread of thought, as organic
as the sequence of the seasons. The
Andante sostenuto, though deeply felt,
was played with fine restraint.
The Scherzo, a delicate movement
usually treated as a welcome respite
after the searchings of the preceding
ones, became fully meaningful on this
occasion, and the final Allegro, filled
with wistfulness, came as a perfect con-
clusion. This was, by a wide margin,
the most moving performance I’ve ever
heard of this lovable work. Firkusny
w'holly immersed himself in the spirit of
Schubert’s ideas and yet gave a com-
pletely individualistic interpretation, one
I feel sure no one could duplicate; in
fact, I rather doubt that Firkusny him-
self could play this gigantic work in just
that way twice running. Throughout
this remarkable performance, I never
doubted that what we heard was being
created at the moment rather than
having been carefully rehearsed.
Though the sonata carried the even-
ing, there were other felicities. A worthy
prelude to the Schubert was provided
by Haydn’s delightful E-flat Sonata, a
work of the composer’s maturity, with
a particularly fine Adagio. In Haydn,
Firkusny tended to favor the pedal and
fast tempi, but his playing was very
stylish and did Haydn full justice.
Brahms’ three Intermezzi and the Rhap-
sodie of opus 119, sounding a trifle cool
and remote after the close involvement
with Schubert, were fine examples of
sound pianism, somewhat reminiscent of
Solomon.
Four of Debussy’s Etudes, though
written for technical practice, became
items of considerable musical interest
and Firkusny revealed that even pieces
which originally had quite a mundane
purpose were yet pervaded by Debussy’s
private atmosphere.
Mr. Firkusny included Bohuslav Mar-
tinu’s “Les Ritournelles,” a work pre-
viously unknown to me. Firkusny and
Martinu were close friends and it was
Firkusny for whom Martinu wrote his
only major piano work; he it was, also,
who first performed many of Martinu’s
smaller works and who introduced “Les
Ritournelles,” written in Paris in 1932,
to American audiences in 1941 after
both he and Martinu had managed to
get out of France. The six pieces which
make up this interesting work remind
a little of early Bartok; they have no
recognisable national flavor, but show
the influence of Gallic charm and wit.
The recital concluded with the Toccata,
opus 11, by Prokofiev.- This is one of
the most difficult works in the piano
literature and I’d imagined, up to now,
that only Prokofiev himself, who had
enormous and powerful hands, could
manage to play it well.
Mr. Firkusny’s touch, even in thun-
dering fortissimi, is sure and consider-
ate and he can produce the kind of
pianissimo that many a frail woman
pianist vainly strives for. His recital
was a major musical event in every
respect and, wonder of wonders, the
ABC’s Town Hall piano was, for once,
in excellent condition and tone.
Theatre
Insistent throbbing
By ROBERT WARD
A Delicate Balance. Edward Albee.
South Australian Theatre Company.
THE LIFE-CYCLE of the South Aus-
tralian Theatre Company is very
curious. It has a variable but always
extensive larval life, in the present case
one lasting some ten months. Toward
the end, from the Mercedes House in-
sectary can be heard a low droning as
Company and Trust complete the mys-
teries of their symbiotic relationship.
Then the lone worker, Mr. John Tasker,
emerges from dormancy. The chrysalis
shudders expectantly.
This year it is the company’s pleasure
to metamorphose three-fold: in eight
weeks, from flesh-pink Albee, to green
and cream Hopgood, and then to
autumnal Pinter. Seriously, it is a good
program, and the excellence of the
current Albee production bodes well for
the rest of the season. One only asks
why there aren’t more seasons.
Albee’s “A Delicate Balance” is
achieved in the American upper middle-
class suburb, where mass-produced
Georgian homes are fitted with leather-
bound libraries bought by the yard. The
action occurs in a panelled drawing-
room excellently designed by Pat Fack-
erell. As the curtain rises a stream of
verbiage is uttered by poised, cold,

pinched Agnes, Patricia Kennedy, in
the general direction of her husband,
the retired, successful, and generally
mild Tobias, superbly played by Rob
Inglis. Agnes’ main concern, apart from
herself, is the alcoholism of Tobias’
sister, Claire. So it seems we are on
familiar ground. We expect to see a
family tear itself to pieces. It doesn’t.
“Virginia Woolf” is another world.
Claire asserts that since she drinks by
choice she is not an alcoholic. Her
manner with Agnes, and the family, is
ironic. Friends, Edna and Harry, arrive
to take refuge from some formless sub-
urban terror, perhaps just solitude, and
with the subsequent arrival of Tobias’
daughter, Julia, who returns from the
ruins of her fourth marriage, the balance
seems lost. With the exception of Claire,
all are on the verge of discovering that
their lives are meaningless, that the
centre of their random secular morality
does not hold.
The play is in a very low key, and its
dramatic tension is very much under
the surface, an insistent throbbing
rather than clean pain. Mr. Tasker main-
tains the mood, moving the play gently,
and with great theatrical tact. Daphne
Grey’s Claire is brittle and cynically
gay. Barbara West as daughter Julia is
a petulant, sometimes contorted,
neurotic. Betty Lucas and Gordon Mc-
Dougall as Edna and Harry are little,
awkward, somewhat timid suburbanites.
All are sensitive performances. The
whole cast works as a smooth, internally
responsive ensemble, each member com-
plementing the other in fine details of
regard, gesture, and reaction, and dis-
playing overall the quality of Mr.
Tasker’s direction.
Half a play
By MADELEINE ARMSTRONG
Gallows Humor. Jack Richardson. Q
Lunch-hour Theatre, Sydney.
IN THE PAST ten years theatre
audiences have learned to expect the
unexpected. No longer does one over-
hear ladies saying loudly to each other
as they pass the chocolates, “Didn’t she
look lovely in that blue dress?” In-
stead, as they sip their coffee, they mur-
mur with charming humility, “What
do you think it means?” or “Do you
think the blue dress (or the dustbin) is
symbolic?” This humility before the
play, and patient willingness to try to
understand the dramatist’s sign lan-
guage, is a great improvement on a
raucous philistine demand for realism.
But humility can be carried too far.
Coming out of the Q Theatre after
seeing “Gallows Humor” I found that
I was very puzzled to know what the
dramatist was up to. The setting is a
prison cell. Walter, a middle-aged
Rob Inglis and Patricia Kennedy in
Albee’s “A Delicate Balance currently
being presented by the South Australian
Theatre Company
lawyer who has murdered his wife, is
due to be hanged in two hours’ time.
The warden arrives, bringing Walter a
splendid last meal and Lucy, a prosti-
tute, who has recently been appointed
to the prison staff as a special amenity
for men in the death cell. “Ha!” you
will say, Comedy of the Absurd, black
farce, grim and hilarious at the same
time. But, in fact, it is uncomfortably
realistic, and the humor is blue rather
than black. Is it a commercial Broad-
way comedy with avant-garde trimmings
or an earnest problem play attacking
capital punishment?
It turns out (but not at the Q
Theatre) to be a modern Morality Play.
But the message is the opposite of what
it used to be in Medieval Morality
Plays, in which everyone was busy in-
dulging in the pleasures of the flesh
and ignoring all warnings that Death
might snatch them away before they
had time to repent. In “Gallows
Humor” both Walter, the murderer,
and Phillip, the hangman, are examples
of death-in-life.
Freedom, spontaneity, and joy, it
turns out, are represented by the pros-
titute, Lucy, an unusual kind of pros-
titute, whose long words and literary
phrases strike oddly on the ear. At the
beginning she seems a creature of sad
necessity and, even when she begins to
expound her philosophy of life, she
does not become a very convincing rep-
resentative of the joy of life.
Perhaps it had better be explained
at this point that the playlet which is
being performed at the Q is only Part
1 of Richardson’s play. When I real-
ised this and read Part 2 and the Pro-
logue and the Preface, which are pub-
lished in a Penguin book of New Ameri-
can Drama, light began to dawn.
It is obviously difficult for the Q
Theatre to find plays which run for
exactly 40 minutes, but in the past
they have usually done a good job of
pruning. To chop a play in half, with-
out even mentioning the fact in the
program, is to take a remarkably cynical
view of the importance of the audience’s
search for meaning.
Films
Not at all deadly
By BEVERLEY TIVEY
The Deadly Affair. Director, Sidney
Lumet.
A Guide for the Married Man. Director,
Gene Kelly.
SPY FILMS have divided into two
types: the glamorous, wish-fulfilling sort
which has now worked itself into a deli-
berate self-parodying absurdity, and the
deliberately unglamorous, bleak view of
the spy or spy-catcher as a drab, self-
doubting civil servant. A novel by John
le Carre is once again the basis for an
absorbing film of the second type.
A middle-aged, worried Government
employee does a routine security check
on a new Foreign Office appointee who
in the distant past professed Communist
sympathies. He reassures the man that
he’ll give him a clean bill of health,
but the man is found shot, apparently
a suicide. Despite official disapproval,
he decides to investigate, though he’s
got troubles enough of his own, to be
sure, with a sexy, unfaithful wife.
Like all Lumet’s films, this is literate,
admirably lucid, understated without
being unemotional. It doesn’t measure
up to his best—“ The Pawnbroker” or
“Long Day’s Journey Into Night”—but
it’s remarkably satisfactory with its terse
script, fine performances, and expert but
unobtrusive editing. James Mason
improves with every film; Simone
Signoret and Harriet Anderson are a
splendid contrast as two women each
facing a different sort of desperation.
Harry Andrews does another clever bit
of picture stealing—he’ll end up in jail
for grand larceny—and as a bonus we
get quite a long sequence of the Royal
Shakespeare Company in a scene from
Marlowe’s “Edward II,” which looks
like a pretty rorty old play.
The color photography in itself would
make the movie worth watching, with
its lovely but mercifully unromantic
view of rainy, grubby old London.
After the visual beauty of “The
Deadly Affair” it’s all the more discon-
certing to see “A Guide for the Married
Man,” which is photographed expertly
enough but reproduction of which is
appalling and not even consistent since
its color values meander from one
degree to another of inaccurate ugli-
ness. It’s a pity, because apart from its
assault on the eyes it is a lively and
diverting comedy. Gene Kelly, like
the dancer he is, brings a choreographic
touch to his direction, and uses his
occasional camera trickery of slowed or
speeded action with wit and discretion.
The mere presence of Walter
Matthau is a big help to any film, and
here he gives an engaging performance
as the happily married man who still
casts longing and apprehensive looks at
other women.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
A sensible alteration on
iron-ore pricing
IT WAS A GAMBLE—and it didn’t
quite work out. But it was probably
worth it for the Government to set its
“guidelines” on iron ore in the hope
of holding the price Japan is to pay
for the millions of tons she is yet to
order from Australia up near the prices
she has already undertaken to pay.
For the Government was faced with a
situation where there were several com-
petitive Australian sellers and one
united buyer (the Japanese steel mills
acting in consortium). This was clearly
a marketing situation that needed some
supervision in the national interest.
And the Government had the know-
ledge that Japanese demand for iron
ore was soon to expand rapidly, so that
the buyer-seller situation had a better
chance of getting into a reasonable re-
lationship the longer the Government
could delay further contracts. But there
was one flaw in what was otherwise
fairly sound thinking; it ignored the
iron-ore supply situation in other coun-
tries like Brazil, to which the Japanese
could turn if they decided Australian
prices were too high. So at the weekend
the Government was forced to relax its
controls over export prices. In future it
will allow lower prices than the present
minimum of 18 U.S. cents a unit that
has existed since the Government
refused.to allow the $lOO million Ham-
ersley contract in January, 1966—and
in future the Government will only
have a “watching brief” over the con-
tracts rather than playing its old, active
part in negotiations.
For, as the Minister for National
Development, Mr. D. E. Fairbairn, said
at the weekend, the development of
iron-ore deposits in South America and
West Africa had produced a very com-
petitive situation in the iron-ore export
trade. “We feel that the stage has now
been reached where too tight a control
of prices lead to the loss of large orders
which the Australian companies had
hoped to negotiate.”
True, the Government’s gamble did
not pay off, but it did prevent all the
iron-ore developers rushing into the
market-place (and into the field, too)
with indecent and unwise haste; on
th* contrary, the development of the
iron-ore fields has gone ahead with sen-
sible restraint as the limited resources
of labor and materials have not all been
claimed at once by the mining de-
velopers and no over-supply of iron
ore has arisen. Hamersley and Golds-
worthy are operating; Newman is un-
der construction; Cliffs is soon to start;
and Lang Hancock is girding his loins.
This expansion is matching Japan’s
steadily increasing demand, not outpac-
ing it. So it is unreal of Sir Maurice
Mawby, as chairman of CRA, Hamers-
ley’s parent, to complain baldly that the
rigid control of iron-ore prices meant
that Australia had lost millions of dol-
lars; the reality is that even with intense
overseas competition there is more
chance now of Australian miners get-
ting many more contracts at better
prices than would have obtained had
the Government allowed an open slather
from the beginning.
Sir Maurice Mawby
In any event, the new relaxation
opens the way for a new battle of wits
between the Japanese steel-makers (who
buy as a tight-knit cartel) and Austra-
lian suppliers of iron ore who will have
to decide whether or not the Japanese
were bluffing in their assertion that
their imports from Australia would
double or treble over the next few years
—but only “if the prices are right and
Canberra’s official guidelines are re-
laxed.”
All the companies selling to Japan—
and the Cliffs group, which should be
the biggest of this new wave of traders
have proposals before the steel mills
The news at the weekend seems cer-
tain to be followed by some big new
contracts to supply Japan at below
guideline prices. Already the guidelines
had been straddled by Mt. Newman and
it may prove that Mr. McEwen intro-
duced them at a strategic time to check
the erosion of prices, knowing that this
re-assessment of the steel mills’ needs
was imminent. It is most unlikely that
the anti-guidelines lobby cry that he
didn’t know what he was doing is
accurate, for there is evidence in this
complex situation that the Japanese
buyers are coming to respect the grow-
ing commercial expertise in this infant
market-place.
Tariffs
ACMA at bay
THE ASSOCIATED Chamber of
Manufactures in Canberra is one of
that city’s most prolific producers of
“Press releases.” And of the various
statements they put out, the most com-
mon deal with tariff policy. Last week’s
spoke of a resolution “deploring the
use of tariffs as a political football,”
saying that this was not “in the national
interest.”
The Chamber of Manufactures can
go on week after week deploring the
fact that tariff policy is a political
matter, but it is hard to see how it
could be otherwise. Each change in
tariff affects the interests of various
groups in opposite measure. A rise in
tariff certainly in thq short-term
furthers the interests of the manufac-
turer of that product, and correspond-
ingly damages the interests of others
who consume it. Low-cost industries
benefit from generally liberal tariff
policies because these keep costs low
and do not tie up resources in high-
cost manufacture. And conversely, of
course, high-cost industries like high
tariffs. This is simply in the nature of
tariffs and however many “deploring”
resolutions ACMA passes it will remain
so.
ACMA also speaks as usual in glow-
ing terms of “the long-established policy
of successive governments to provide
adequate assistance for economic and
efficient Australian industries.” This is
to say very little, because the whole
argument in tariff matters is about
what constitutes “an economic and
efficient industry,” and it is this which
the Tariff Board and the Government
seek to establish. It is not something
which is self-evident as the Chamber
of Manufactures purports to believe.


THE WEEK BRIEFLY
For the economy: Dr. Coombs’ Reserve Bank report
mentioned, among many other things, that “capacity to
produce should be developed as rapidly as possible and
policy should be designed to prevent it being outstripped by
growth in domestic demand.” The report is discussed by
J. C. Horsfall on page 60.
As was widely expected, wool prices clearly fell through-
out the first series of 1966-67 sales.
July’s building approvals looked reasonably happy in both
non-residential and residential sections . . . Production
statistics indicate a fair position for domestic appliances.
For the markets: The miners’ variability has been
confirmed as a real downswing on Australian share markets;
Sydney base metals index lost a net 44.16 points. Industrials
began to edge forward again toward the week’s close.
Quiet dealings in London mostly concentrated on second-
line issues . . . Wall Street tried to rally on Friday after-
noon; this merely reduced some early losses.
For companies: So BHP’s exports for the 1966-67
year galloped up from 365,700 to 1,001,213 tons, making a
“substantial” contribution to profit; capital spending reached
$117.2m., down $9.5m. on the previous year.
Two builders kept the flag well and truly flying ... In
Melbourne, E. A. Watts earned $35,435 more at $536,756
and therefore sent dividend from 11 to 12 percent on a
41.2 percent earning rate . . . Sydney’s T. C. Whittle held
a steady 10 percent while profits moved $17,206 to $186,012
. . . Building materials maker PGH Industries found some
States uneven; profit dropped by $40,261 to $720,000 and
dividend looks like becoming 14 percent instead of 16.
Three years running Peko-Wallsend has raised its divid-
end, this time from 16 to 18 percent on earnings lifted from
$1,346,810 to $1,854,720; copper and mineral sands helped
prodigiously. There’s also important new gold and bismuth
assays at Juno near Tennant Creek . . . Six months’ results
of Conzinc Riotinto brought earnings up $1,136,000 to
$6,367,000 after much lower tax; Hamersley is helping and
the full year should go at much the same rate . . . Alcoa
of Australia proposes to increase its Kwinana alumina out-
put by one-third to 830,000 metric tons a year .
An excellent first half came to John Lysaght with earn-
ings at $3,915,000 (previous corresponding half, $2.7m.),
the interim goes from 5|- to 6 percent and directors are
confident of the economy and themselves . . . Engineer
Australian National Industries slipped from $520,789 to
$441,392 keeping a steady 7 percent . . . Builders’ supplier
ARC Industries decided to hold the 8f percent payout
even though profits dropped 34 percent; the current year
apparently looks better . . . Newbold General Refractories
experienced a favorable second half; the complete year
yielded a $120,760 improvement to $784,361 . . . Electrical
engineer Warburton Franki went to 12 percent from 10 per-
cent following a profit advance from $299,926 to $349,982.
A 22 percent rise marked financier Alliance Holdings; a
steady 10 percent goes out on profits of $960,073 . . .
Mercantile Credits could only report a 2 percent rise to
$1,517,981.
Associated Pulp and Paper Mills went down from
$3,118,974 to $2,615,410; so did the dividend—from 9J to
9 percent . . . Carpet Manufacturers sent payout forward,
from 9 to 10 percent, with profits up from $316,510 to
$362,789 . . . Ford Motor Company (of Australia), had a
very cheerful six months as profit went to $5,819,398
(previously $40,066).
Cigarette maker Rothmans of Pall Mall is working away
from its dismal 1966-67 year . . . Soft-serve ice-cream vendor
Mr. Whippy is looking much more dismal.
MEN AND
THE MAN WHO pulled the fat out
of the Deposit and Investment fire for
his lifetime employer Perpetual Trustee
Co., Mr. W. S. (Bill) Matthews, is
breathing a bit more easily since publi-
cation of last week’s dramatic profit
recovery by D. and I. He hopes never
again to live through such dark days
as those of 1964 and 1965, when losses
ran into millions, with extensive write-
offs of bad debts largely in small busi-
ness financing. Hard work from a good
and devoted staff saved the day, he says.
Bill Matthews started his business
career in the Taxation Department, but
left there to join Perpetual Trustee in
1921. In May, 1964, Perpetual Trustee
■exercised their right, as trustee for
Deposit and Investment debenture
holders, to put a director on the board,
and he was their choice. In August he
became chairman of D. and I. and
the following month retired as manager
of Perpetual Trustee.
His old firm is honorary treasurer of
the N.S.W. section of the Royal Flying
Doctor Service, hence Bill Matthews
has been associated with this organis-
ation for twenty years, was at one time
president, and is currently vice-presi-
dent. Delivery of the Service’s new
$120,000 Beagle, the first replacement
for the Drover fleet, was the occasion
for ceremonial picture-taking, to which
we owe our photo, for Mr. Matthews
says he hasn’t had his photo taken since
the ’twenties.
He is also bashful about a more per-
sonal hobby of ancient and medieval
history, because he feels anything with-
out an economic object is considered
rather silly. Of later history, he claims
to be absymally ignorant.
WHILE STILL IN office the reticence
of GM-H directors to vent their views
in public is proverbial. The exception
to prove the rule was Sir Laurence
Hartnett, who recently and rather be-
latedly received the accolade. When
they retire, as Mr. Arthur C. Wigan
the former supply director of GM-H
did on reaching 65 a few weeks ago,
it can be quite different. It is a sad
state of affairs, said Wigan on his re-
turn from leading a trade mission io
Europe, but many firms exporting
manufactured goods don’t answer their
mail.
Hartnett and Wigan were in double
harness at GM-H long before they
teamed together in Australia’s first car-
building project. Wigan, who was at
St. Peters, Adelaide, joined the pioneer
firm, Holden Motor Body Builders, in
1924, witnessed its merger with General
Motors in 1931 when he was supply
manager and, after transfer to Mei-
A. C. Wigan
W. S. Matthews
bourne in 1943, moved up to supply
manager (1945) and a place on the
board two years later.
Also like Hartnett, Wigan, who lives
near Mr. Holt in Toorak, has come
under special notice by the Government.
He got the CBE two years back for
his work (since 1953) as deputy chair-
man for the past 12 years of the De-
partment of Defence’s board of business
administration and with the manufac-
turing industries’ advisory council.
When Federal Treasurer, Mr. Holt sent
him on a three months’ assignment as
adviser to a special economic mission to
study the then proposed Malaysian
Federation. In June this year came his
second special assignment from the PM
to lead the trade mission to Europe.

If you’re wondering how we manage to cover that
many miles an hour, the answer is really
very simple. We do it by going so many places. All
at once. Just as we’re about to take off in San
Francisco, we’re landing in Hong Kong, circling over
Manila, approaching Zamboanga, serving
cocktails above Honolulu, fastening seat belts in
Australia and taxiing in to Taipei. You
can see how a thing like that adds up. So there’s
really nothing new about flying
6,000 m.p.h. We do it every day.

THE
CROESUS
TOUCH
Is Dr. Coombs
polishing the
monetary weapon?
BY J. C. HORSFALL
THE FEDERAL BUDGET having
taken an expansionist line it would
have been unthinkable in these en-
lightened times if the Reserve Bank’s
report had come out in opposition in
the manner of this column. It is a long
time since we’ve had the Treasury and
the Bank at loggerheads, with fiscal
policy pulling one way and monetary
policy the other. Let it be said at once
that, if Mr. McMahon has sold his
line to Dr. Coombs against the latter’s
inclinations, as one of the world’s lead-
ing central bankers, his powers of per-
suasion would have to be reckoned
more impelling than we thought.
But wait. A close reading of the
Reserve Bank report does not dispel
the hope that at least Dr. Coombs is
polishing his monetary weapons, even
if not proposing their early use in an
economic containment exercise.
The report acknowledges as, indeed,
did the Treasurer in his Budget speech,
that economic activity is pressing
somewhere near the limit of available
resources. Dr. Coombs’ version is that,
by the end of last year, the moderate
degree of excess capacity evident in
the economy at the beginning of it has
“largely disappeared.” Again, on prices,
he notes that while the rise over the
year was very modest the rate of in-
crease became more marked toward
its end. On the external position we
find him equally discerning. Last year,
says the report, the deterioration in the
balance of payments and the conse-
quential loss in reserves “were not suf-
ficient to cause immediate concern,”
but the latter “cannot be allowed to
continue indefinitely”; if the present
downward trend is extended “we may
be faced with a more serious conflict
between domestic and external bal-
ance!”
One gathers from this that the Bank
sees some conflict at the moment,
though not yet a serious one. It seems
to have its eyes fixed very keenly on
the future prospect for financing suf-
ficient imports. These, it emphasises,
have played a big part in “keeping
prices stable and avoiding bottlenecks.”
With overseas payments for defence
equipment looming large in future im-
port bills, the report is certainly right
on that and one wonders why a stronger
inference is not drawn from it for
monetary policy; the more so, consid-
ering the continued force of income
generation (as noted here last week)
and also the inflationary portents
acknowledged (as stated above) by the
Bank itself.
The Reserve Bank knows its own
business and apparently it is satisfied
with its wagging of a warning finger at
the trading banks in the June quarter
this year. As the report itself puts it:
“Early in the final quarter of the year
when trading-bank lending had in-
creased substantially and activity was
rising more rapidly and was being re-
flected in a rising level of imports,
trading banks were, requested to mod-
erate their new lending. This request
also took into account the decline in
bank liquidity that seemed likely in
the closing months of the year” (when
presumably the constraint asked for
would have a more telling effect).
It will be noted that there was no
attempt to enforce this by increasing
Statutory Reserve Deposits. Indeed,
apart from a reduction in SRDs to pro-
vide part of a replenishment of Term
Loan Accounts, the determination of
these was not changed over the year.
That warning to the trading banks
went out about five months ago and
monetary policy has been unchanged
since. I’m not going to tell the Gov-
ernor to go and suck eggs, but I’m
a little surprised that in his report
he seems to be as happy as the
Treasurer that the financial yeast is
now rising all round. The report takes
a good deal of satisfaction (much too
much in my view) from the fact, as it
puts it, that the financial intermedia-
ries “were well placed to meet the in-
crease in demand for finance and in
addition that private sector holdings of
most liquid assets had risen strongly
in 1966-67 and were a potential source
of finance to cover rising expenditure.”
What this seems to be saying is that
the financial system is well equipped
to cater for any increases in demand
for finance that may be thrown up.
There is no hint that the Bank is per-
turbed that the forces it recognises to
be behind price increases need to be
constrained by a countervailing mone-
tary policy.
Clearly the Reserve Bank is in no
more hurry than the Treasury is to
apply the brakes at the present time.
On this there’s a most remarkable para-
graph in the report which warns against
taking action prematurely. It says that
“lags before policy becomes effective
make it desirable to act quickly, but
on the other hand there is, particularly
in the period under review, always the
risk that action taken too early later
proves to have been unwise.” One gets
the impression from this that the Bank
has forgotten the drastic failure of
monetary policy to do a containment
job in the heady financial climate lead-
ing up to the 1960 boom. In that
period monetary policy was brought
into the play too late, long after the
inflation horse had bolted and even
after it had been caught.
When to act is, of course, a matter
of judgment. But in the Reserve Bank’s
case the views of the Treasurer have
to be taken into account. With the
Treasurer still in an expansive mood,
perhaps Dr. Coombs feels that he has
to go along with him even if a little
dubious. If the report had been more
positive in its fears of inflation one
would have been mere prepared to
expect a containment move from him
pretty soon. But as it merely dabbles
among the doubts without underlining
the dangers, one would now expect the
Governor, like the Treasurer, to “let
’er rip” for a while until the evidence
of inflationary pressure looks more
compelling to him.
It would upset the trading banks”
applecart if Dr. Coombs soon had to
come down on them to work his mone-
tary policy will after all the blessings
they’ve received from the monetary-
authorities in the past year or so. In.
this period the Governor has been bend-
ing the elbow with them to more con-
vivial purpose than ever before, with
the idea, as explained in the report, of
acknowledging their superior efficiency
among financial institutions. The cun-
ning old fox must be getting tired in
his mellowing years of boxing with the
banks. At long last he’s acknowledg-
ing the view that if the banks get more
of the country’s credit business and
the fringe bankers less, so much the
more effective will be his control of
credit in the system as a whole. The
argument may not be watertight, of
course, because if both the banks and
the fringe bankers start firing all their
barrels at the same time in a boom or
even a near boom, Dr. Coombs will
have his work more than cut out.
For what it is worth, his view now,
as given in the report, is that “a rise
in the banks’ share of financing in-
creases the direct influence of monetary
policy, provides competition to higher
cost lenders (he is now letting the banks;
into the bridging finance field to pro-
vide finance at reasonable above maxi-
mum overdraft rates) and can increase
the indirect impact of policy on the
operation of the financial intermediaries
by affecting the cost and availability
of funds.” With this as the new
approach one wonders what transpired
at the various chats he now admits to
having with the fringe financiers dur-
ing the year. It is just possible that
everybody got drunk. It is also possible
that when the next credit squeeze goes
on the fringe boys will have the last
laugh, as they did last time.

Queensland tackles the Brigalow
By VIC WORSTEAD
ON JULY 13 this year, after a tour
through parts of Central Queensland,
three energetic parliamentary pro-
ponents of northern development made
a joint statement at Rockhampton.
They were the Federal Minister for
National Development, Mr. Fairbairn;
the Queensland' Premier, Mr. Nicklin;
and Western Australia’s Minister for
Industrial Development and the
North-west, Mr. Charles Court. They
maintained, inter alia:
“We have reached the point where
it is no longer practicable for Austra-
lia to think of northern development
solely in terms of individual projects,
even though some involve hundreds
of millions of dollars. We have agreed
that the future overall approach should
be to regional and industrial develop-
ments based on the great natural re-
sources already known to exist through-
out the north.
“In short, we feel we can now pur-
sue more positively the sort of develop-
ment in depth that we envisaged when
we held our first ministerial meeting
on northern development in May,
1964.”
These words may sound blandly
unexceptionable, except that the mild-
est remarks on “the north” often seem
capable of generating the kind of pas-
sions usually reserved for such matters
as football and pop stars. The Minis-
ters apparently envisage another series
of joint studies by “Commonwealth
and State experts.”
One regional agricultural develop-
ment at least in Central Queensland
is now well beyond the study stage,
still surrounded by a measure of con-
troversy, yet still lovingly and skilfully
tended by a bevy of experts. This is
the famous Fitzroy Basin brigalow
scheme. There may be some reluc-
tance on the part of Queensland offi-
cials to discuss it in terms of cost-
benefit analysis, although Dr. Rex
Patterson has already done so. There
can be no doubt, however, of the
scientific and technical expertness
which has gone into the scheme.
(Incidentally, one gets the impression
in Queensland that far more high-
level expertise is available for rural
affairs than for industrial.)
Brigalow scrub (although it is actu-
ally a small tree, Acacia harpophylla )
has always presented difficulties to
Australian farming. Brute clearing
could be strenuous enough, but, in
Professor Wadham’s words, “the plant
has a very extensively branched root
system capable of producing buds at
many points, and each bud can grow
into a stem if the original shoots are
destroyed.” Travelling in the brigalow
country you hear plenty about the
brigalow “suckers.”
Nobody has questioned either the
fertility or the great potential of the
belt, and to see those portions of it at
present developed is to realise why.
Here is impressive plain country which
can absorb stock for fattening, dairy
cattle, sheep, and grain growing. What
has been thrashed about are details of
timing, the granting of Commonwealth
finance, and some relative slowness in
taking up available blocks. Of course,
the better situated parts (for instance,
Moura - Theodore - Biloela - Monto in
Central Queensland) appear reasonably
established and generally economically
viable.
The major brigalow area stretches
about 700 miles and moves inland up
northern New South Wales to Collins-
ville, North Queensland. The Fitzroy
Basin scheme covers some 11 million
acres, and its aim is especially to expand
the production of beef cattle.
Overall plans have the intellectual
blessing of the Federal Bureau of Agri-
cultural Economics and, overwhelm-
ingly important, the financial backing
of the Federal Government to the
tune of a loan up to $14.5m. over the
eight years from July 1, 1962. Queens-
land had proposed to terminate any
existing tenancies and, by resubdivision,
to create not less than 250 and not more
than 400 blocks. Existing leaseholders
receive “full consideration.”
A visitor to the principal town centres
sees that the present development is
being backed by particularly effective
Emerald’s first cotton pick
agricultural advice and research.
“Suckers” remain under continuous sur-
veillance; the research station at Theo-
dore focuses upon such control as one
of the major problems of its basic study
program. The period of delay between
pulling and burning on the density of
regrowth is vital. Older methods of
scrub pulling and clearing have given
way to the use of two heavy tractors
linked by a heavy steel cable or chain;
the tractors work in unison, about 11-
chains apart.
It’s almost unnecessary to add that
many facilities have had to be brought
into the area —water, tick control, and,
above all, satisfactory roads. Author-
ities archly admit that “at the com-
mencement of the scheme, the Fitzroy
Basin was badly served in this respect.”
Work on the five million acres com-
prising areas 1 and 2 is approaching
completion; area 3, a further six million
acres, is barely commenced. This latter
area is classed as slightly inferior to 1
and 2. All are generally in a 25in. rain-
fall area. Originally the land carried
one beast to 30 or 40 acres. Cleared and
planted to improved grasses, it should
be able to carry one beast to 6-8 acres.
The whole scheme may increase the
cattle carried from 300,000 to one
million. To the end of May, balloting
had disposed of 84 blocks, while sales
at auction (averaging $6.29 an acre)
accounted for 29 blocks.
Critics have not hesitated to point
out the tardiness of individual farmers
in taking up blocks, blaming this prim-
arily on the large amount of capital
needed to qualify for ballot. Analysis
certainly indicates a decent return on
investment, yet, like all developmental
projects, the returns do not arrive
quickly. A few observers believe the
companies should be allowed in.
Queensland may, as in the past, al-
most automatically tend to favor rural
development, although some outstand-
ing progress in mining and secondary
industries gives the lie to the fixity of
the old attitudes. What the brigalow
does show is great ability in supporting
development with skilled, devoted
attention and research. It deserves to
succeed.
And now, of course, the State is
putting up for full investigation a vast
new Emerald Irrigation Scheme “to
mitigate drought effects in Central
Queensland . . . provide very profitable
irrigation production programs ... to
provide a greater degree of stability in
rural production.” The Commonwealth
and State experts will again have to
cut their teeth on a capital investment
requiring $26.6m. They will find a basis
in careful records from two already
existent pilot farms.

SPECULATOR’S
DIARY
The family touch:
a present
for Father's Day
IT IS A WELL-KNOWN fact that,
company-wise, Australia is controlled,
though not owned, by a handful of
chosen people. It is not, however, quite
so well known why these particular
people were actually chosen. A new
book just out throws some light on
this intriguing subject. It is aptly called
“The Controllers,” and it reads like
“The Power Game.” All sorts of in-
teresting titbits about hereditary suc-
cession, interlocking directorships, and
brothers-in-law come in for the magni-
fying glass treatment. Irfctead of trying
to cover the whole Australian scene the
book sensibly sticks to studying only
50 of our largest companies. This is
enough to give everyone the general
idea. The study shows that the 50
companies are related to 275 other
companies by interlocking director-
ships; that 49 chairmen hold a total
of 161 directorships, and that 169 direc-
tors share between them 617 director-
ships. All a bit inbred, isn’t it?
Talking about families, a stock I’m
buying as a Father’s Day present is
A. G. Healing. This group has a
variety of interests, and among other
things is the country’s biggest steel
founder, one of its largest manufac-
turers and distributors of domestic ap-
pliances, and one of its top distributors
of automotive parts. Over recent
months the share price has been well
and truly kicked downstairs by the
market. It is now down to 11 cents,
which is a mere tenth of the asset
backing, and which, in my opinion, is
way out of line with its true worth.
Admittedly, the company lost $l.l
million last year and was down $741,698
in the six months to December last.
Yet these were the company’s only
losses ever, after 35 years of trading.
Also, it should be remembered that
Healing earned well over $3 million in
the three years before 1966. So histori-
cally it’s not doing all that badly. The
main causes of the company’s dilemma
were the fall-off sales of automotive
parts, fierce competition in the dom-
estic-appliance field, and a costly tech-
nical problem involving one of its
manufactured lines. All these trouble
spots have now resolved themselves.
The only other slur on the com-
pany’s name is its liquidity problem.
This, however, is now over its worst
stages and there are no large repay-
ments due until 1970. In the mean-
time, the company is rationalising its
resources by selling off much of its
surplus freehold. As most of this is
worth much more than its book value,
some sizable capital profits can be ex-
pected. This will make the asset-back-
ing situation even more appealing. With
all these bull points going for it, I
feel the share price must soon start to
move up. To be in on the capital pro-
fits myself, I bought 2000.
Another company that looks good for
capital benefits is Wattyl. This is the
company which became so well known
for its telly ad with the horse (Chester
is his name) wandering around on a
freshly painted Estapol floor. It has also
just announced a l-for-4 premium issue
which will help lower its earning rate
to less capitalistic levels but which will
still give a more than healthy cover of
2.5 times to its steady 16 percent divi-
dend. The rights, of which there had
been no sales at the time of writing,
could be a cheap entry into the stock.
All sales this week were profitable
ones. After paying my broker, Deposit
Investment netted me $46, Brambles
$5O, and Western Titanium $76.

No wonder he’s the family favourite. Clean warm
air circulating in every room throughout the
coldest periods of the year. No huddling around
ineffective one-room heaters!
No frigid early morning toes! Instead, the won-
derful feeling of being able to wear summertime
clothes throughout your home every day of the
year—and with simple, finger-tip control!
Low fuel costs, too, and all fully automatic,
even the economical oil burner —that’s what
Gilbarco Central “Whole House” Heating means
in the successful man’s home. You can get all
this for little more than the cost of heating
two or three rooms with “huddle-over” heating!
Two systems from which to choose: The popular
Hot Water Central Heating system incorporating
The Potterton Boiler unit, which supplies
throughout-the-home heat with a complete hot
water service: or a fully ducted warm air system
in which air is fan-circulated from a Gilbarco
Warm Air Furnace.
Both heating units are compact enough to place
in the garage, laundry, basement or even under
the house.

Moving from the financiers
into the banks
MINING • SHARE LIST • BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
MARKET POINTERS • SECURITY ANALYSIS • COMMODITIES
By JASON
DON’T OVERDO it, but there is
something to be said for a bit of a
move out of the finance industry into
the banks. The financiers have had a
very good run indeed (and we’ve been
keen supporters of the better stocks,
particularly AGO, which we expect
will continue to do very well indeed).
So far this year, the “other finance”
section of the Sydney share price index
has continued the solid rises of the past
two years, with the 11 percent lift in
the latest nine months, bringing the in-
dustry’s market recovery for the past
two years up to 22 percent (and quite
rightly, too, judging from the generally
excellent results that the finance com-
panies have been putting out in recent
weeks).
This has been a much better rise
than the banks have had. True, the
banks have kept pace with the finance
companies in 1967, particularly follow-
ing the March announcement that banks
could compete with the finance com-
panies by making personal loans on
instalments. But the 12 percent rise in
the share price index for banks so far
this year represents almost all of the
recovery this group has had since the
dismal levels of September, 1965 (when
the index had fallen by 21 percent in
the previous 18 months). For both
the banks and the finance companies,
this year has everything at its best;
there is plenty of money around for
them to raise, there are plenty of people
wanting to borrow it, and for the banks
there is the special sweetener that the
proportion of their deposits being held
by the Reserve Bank is very low.
It does seem that the banks have been
able to satisfy some customers who
might have been clients of finance
houses. But there are plenty of other
clients around. For the most difficult
thing for a finance company is raising
money, not lending it. So even though
the banks have been allowed to move
into the finance field a bit, and even
though some of the- major motor manu-
facturers have been directing more of
their business to their own hire pur-
chase offshoots, and even though con-
sumer spending has been fairly slow to
pick up in the areas where finance com-
panies generally operate their retail fin-
ancing, recent profit figures show it has
not been too hard for them to make
money by moving into other fields; some
have even been able to make profits by
buying Commonwealth bonds. (The im-
provement in motor-vehicle registrations
does not appear to have had much of
an impact on finance company results,
as to some extent it has been brought
about by increased buying of vehicles
for commercial fleets, in many instances
involving a switch from Holden to Ford,
for cash.)
So there is every indication that
finance company profits should con-
tinue high this year, but that their
shares do not look so cheap in relation
to their prospects as they did 18 months
to two years ago. On the other hand,
the banks should do appreciably better
in the new monetary climate pro-
vided their managements are capable
of taking advantage of the new flexi-
bility. Specifically, the banks will now
be able to earn a bit more on some
of their advances because of last
week’s approval by the Reserve Bank
for them to lend for bridging finance
and on short-term mortgage “at reason-
able rates of interest.” This is under-
stood to mean up to 9 percent, com-
pared with the present overdraft maxi-
mum of percent (and with the 12
percent or so that most finance houses
seem to charge.)
While this (and the recent personal
loans arrangements) will bring a bit of
an improvement to bank incomes, it
will only be a bit, since this sort of
business is eventually likely to make
up only about $lOO or $2OO million out
of total bank advances at present of
$3200 million. But even this could in-
volve an extra $2 million to $4 million
in gross revenues to be shared between
the trading banks, so that it could mean
a few hundred thousand dollars in
added profit to the bigger banks.
Naturally, it is absurd to expect that
the easy money conditions of the pre-
sent time will last for ever; there seems
every indication that monetary policy
restraints would be the first things
called for if the present rate of eco-
nomic expansion got a little out of
hand. And that would mean that the
banks might find their ability to lend
being a little circumscribed. But now
that Reserve Bank influence spreads
right across the monetary field, there
is a better chance of monetary policy
changes being felt by the finance
houses as well as the banks.
The simple basic point remains. This
new liberalism of the Reserve Bank to
The Chartist says:
HILL 50 GOLD MINE N.L. was first recommended in December, 1966, around
the price level of 29c. The minimum probable move of 65c indicated was achieved
in June of this year and the situation should now be reappraised in view of recent
market action. It now has the possibility of moving to much higher levels, the first
about the $l.OO level, where a good deal of resistance selling would be encountered,
and a more optimistic longer-term objective of $1.50. It has now established a
well “tested” trendline at a basic rate of 300 percent appreciation per annum, and
could be strongly recommended to investors on technical grounds at present. Last
sale price on 22-8-67—54 c.

monetary control. It means that shares

SO STEEL HAD VERY little to do
with the 18 percent profit lift by steel
merchant and industrial and engineering
supplier J. Blackwood & Son Ltd. There
is now no doubt at all that, except for
Lysaghts which did so remarkably well
(and which we recommended on April
1 at $2.80), the BHP record steel pro-
duction figures for 1966-67 had little im"
plication for local steel merchants’ pro-
fits, presumably because such a large
proportion of it was exported.
As we forecast in a favorable “Be-
hind the Balance Sheets” item on this
company on July 1, the main factor in
Blackwood’s profit rise was its non-
steel merchandising subsidiaries, which
contributed almost 80 percent of the
latest profit rise and whose proportion
of group net profit is now almost 40
percent (roughly in proportion to sales).
Two years ago it was only 25 percent.
This year there is every prospect of
Blackwood’s steel business doing much
better as the economy continues its
improvements with official blessing
following last month’s Budget, as
demand for steel is a basic indicator
of the pace of industrial advance. And
the same goes for all the other steel
merchants which are at present look-
ing a bit down in the mouth because
of only moderate profits.
But if steel failed to do much for
J. Blackwood’s profits, it can hardly
be blamed for the profit slip by rival
merchant William Atkins, which seems
related more to the “intensely compe-
titive” aluminium side of its opera-
tions. For while the big aluminium pro-
ducers and semi-fabricators are show-
ing improved profits and increasing
turnovers, aluminium wholesaling has
become a very tough game, indeed,
with some of the semi-fabricators taking
strong positions in wholesaling them-
selves and so being prepared to earn
minimal profits from this section of
their business simply to get higher
throughput in the more profitable pro-
duction end of the operations.
There is no doubt that sooner or later
the aluminium side of Atkins will pay
off. But as rival steel distributor J.
Blackwood commented, when justifying
its abstention from this industry, alu-
minium wholesaling is not an activity
where good profits can be earned in
the forseeable future.

Drug Houses: what has happened
to that ’fifties growth?
THE GROUP WHICH has been selec-
ted on this occasion is hardly homo-
geneous. One has some difficulty in
seeing any similarity in the activities
of ACI, CIG, and DHA; perhaps the
only point of similarity at all is the
fact that each company has become
known by the initials of its name.
Drug Houses of Australia Ltd. was
formed in 1929 to amalgamate the
existing businesses of the principal
wholesale druggists of Australia, which
at that, time consisted of Elliots and
Australian Drug, of Sydney, Felton,
Grimwade & Duerdins, of Melbourne,
A. M. Bickford & Sons, of Adelaide
and Brisbane, Felton, Grimwade &
Bickford, of Perth, and Taylors, Elliots
and Australian Drug, of Brisbane, Rock-
hampton, and Townsville. The repeti-
tion of the various names in the com-
panies’ titles is obvious and only “Tay-
lors” and “Duerdins” occur once.
There seems little doubt that the
original group was purely a whole-
saler, but over the years a certain
amount of change took place and by
1961 about 15 percent of the employees
of the group were engaged in manu-
facturing. It seems likely that the
management was rather concerned with
the prospects of keeping pace with the
new overseas manufacturers, who had
been either extending their activities
in Australia or who were establishing
themselves here, because it looks as
though over the next few years they
decided to merge their major manu-
facturing activities with some very sub-
stantial U.S.A. companies such as Cya-
nimid and Baxter. On the face of it,
such moves looked like good, sound
commonsense, because there was no
way that DHA could have hoped to
keep pace with these large overseas
groups in research, whether this
research was basic research or product
development. In retrospect, the earnings
per share of the group seem to have
gone steadily downward since these
decisions were taken.
It is probably fair to say that this
decline has been due to other circum-
stances. But we will never know
whether DHA failed to get the maxi-
mum advantage out of the “assets”
which they gave away when negotiat-
ing the agreements with the overseas
groups. Certainly the whole pattern of
trade has changed so far as the retail
chemist is concerned.
The profit picture is not very inspir-
ing but there is evidence of a steady, if
small, improvement since 1963-4. The
adjusted figures (“earnings per share”
in the schedule) show a smaller rate of
increase because the tax provision has
been increasing as a percentage of pre-
tax profit. Even so, this percentage is
low when compared with the standard
rate of 42J percent. In the past three
years, investment allowances have been
claimed in respect of plant installed
at the new Brooklyn factory, and the
company receives allowances for ex-
port promotion.
Another noticeable feature is the
decline in the proprietors’ (ordinary
shareholders) interest despite the fact
that the company does not have any
long-term debt. In recent years there
has been a marked increase in the use
of bank overdraft. At June 30, 1959,
there was no bank overdraft, but at
June 30, 1962, the overdraft was over
$2 million and at June 30, 1966, over
S4J million. Trade creditors increased
from s2f million at June 30, 1959, to
nearly S3J million at June 30, 1962,
and reached S4J million at June 30,
1966.
The reduction in the shareholders’
equity seems then to have resulted from
a greater interest being taken by the
bank and trade creditors.
The preliminary announcement of
the profit for the year to June 30, 1967,
does not, of course, give any indica-
tion to the trend in balance-sheet items;
it does suggest that tax benefits were
substantially less than in the past three
years. It looks as though the slightly
rising trend in per share earnings will
be reversed in 1966-7, yet per share
earnings will still be about 13.8 cents
per share.
What, then, has happened to the
promising growth of the ’fifties, which
had the shares selling at an average
price-earnings multiple of 18 in 1963
and a maximum price-earnings multiple
of 18.4?
In the absence of any better explan-
ation, it must be assumed that, when
the price scales were adjusted for the
“Free Drug” Scheme in 1963 and
thereafter, DHA’s margins suffered
quite dramatically. One could well have
taken the view that similar growth

could have continued because the “de-
mand” for the free-drug scheme would
continue at the same rate as in the past.
However, the first reduction in margins
may well have been followed by others,
for the price of some drugs was reduced
again in 1964 and this was followed by
a very substantial reduction in 1965.
The main supplier of the range of
drugs which suffered these reductions
was Cyanamid-DHA, in which DHA
has an interest of about 20 percent.
A few years ago it was suggested that
the wholesaler’s position in the phar-
maceutical industry was untenable be-
cause the manufacturer was selling
direct to the retail chemist, and where
this was not happening the retail
chemists were forming their own whole-
sale organisations to deal with the
manufacturer. The implication was that
the middleman’s days were numbered
and only those on the ends could sur-
vive. Certainly all the evidence pointed
that way and there were some prece-
dents in the food industry. It is now
clear that although DHA’s profit record
is in no way remarkable, the profit of
some manufacturers has declined quite
markedly; it would appear that not all
retail chemist shops are the bonanzas
that they used to be.
DHA could have responded to the
difficult conditions throughout the
pharmaceutical industry by diversifi-
cation outside the industry. In 1964,
there were very protracted negotiations
with Henry Berry & Co (A’asia) but
nothing was achieved. The advantages
of such a merger were rather difficult
for an outsider to see so far as DHA
was concerned; it was fairly clear that
Henry Berry would benefit from DHA’s
strong cash position. Only recently
there was an announcement that DHA
had acquired a “privately owned” com-
pany for approximately $176,000 —the
purchase price being satisfied by an
issue of 110,200 ordinary shares in
DHA at $1.60 per share.
At this stage, there are no signs on
the horizon which would suggest a
dramatic upward trend in per share
earnings and there certainly does not
appear to be any prospects of an in-
crease in the ten percent dividend rate.
The price that should be paid for the
shares today depends on one’s own rule
of thumb for valuation. Many like to

The Melbourne market
Industrials aren’t running away
THE TIME LOOKS so ripe for get-
ting into ordinary shares that one
would expect a lot of switching out of
currently high mining counters to be
going on. Some of it is, of course, but
with brokers still talking the iron ore
and nickel glamor stocks higher,
people have been reluctant to take
their profits despite the old adage
that nobody rings a bell when the top
is reached.
Old adage or no, not a very loud
bell was rung by CRA’s investment
manager at the Assembly Hall on the
Monday night of last week; unfor-
tunately for speculators and genuine
investors alike, when the market
opened on Tuesday in mining stocks
it was all one way, down just as
if somebody had sold a great big bear
of the whole mining market. So, any-
body considering taking his profits on
inflated mining shares last week and
switching into industrials had, for the
time being, missed the bus. He would
have to wait until the next one came
along, though none was scheduled so
far as one knows.
All the rest of the week the min-
ing counters were merely limping
along not much above, if at all, the
levels to which Mr. Harding had sent
them. Maybe if it hadn’t been for
some buying in far-away places, to
which distance lends enchantment
looked at from a socialist setting, per-
haps the market wouldn’t have put
up even the mildly brave face it
managed. How many tried mining
shareholders are going to wait for the
next bus is anyone’s guess; when CRA
can issue such an optimistic report as
it did during the week and the shares
go down further, the prospect of its
arrival looks distant.
On the face of it, a waiting game
in mining shares is better for indus-
trials than the sort of shoving that’s
been going on in them for so long, but
last week’s sudden drop in mining
shares, leaving those holders expec-
tant of taking their profits and switch-
ing into industrials high and dry, is
not going to help industrials much.
Nor, as it happens, has there been
all that much genuine buying of in-
dustrials in the past week, despite the
continued flow of good results com-
ing from companies, and the general
all-clear to buy coming from Mr.
McMahon. If good company results
preponderate heavily in the announce-
ments reaching the market last week,
for some people’s liking there have
been rather more cuts in dividend and
drops in profit than is healthy after
such a good year, at any rate the lat-
ter half of it, in the economy. As
nobody has yet come up with an in-
dex of ordinary shares without the
glamor “oil stock” BHP in it, the
edging-down of the present two in-
dustrial indexes during the week, when
BHP itself came back from a peak of
$1£.36 to $11.80), failed to give an
accurate guide to the general market
performance of industrial equities. Let
us say that last week there was no
sign of this market running away and
leave it at that.
Although the good outweighed the
bad among the week’s results, the latter
included some real shockers; not that
the latter were altogether unexpected,
Mr. Whippy’s, for example. The posi-
tion of that company, whose shares
have only been on ’Change a couple
of years, has gone from bad to worse
over the past eighteen months. The
new chairman, Mr. N. E. Jones, who
has been trying to get things straight
since he took over in March this year,
has not yet been able to see the light
of day. All he can say in face of heavy
write-offs of book values of assets and
unforeseen liabilities is that lossess since
January have been very heavy, though
since March costs have been reduced
and the rate of loss cut accordingly.
This cannot be much comfort either to
the public with shares in it or to Mr.
Charles Forte, in London, whose Forte
Holdings Ltd. has a 53 percent stake
in the affair.
Thankfully, the dismal results of
Tarax, the soft drink people, were not
as bad as those for Mr. Whippy’s soft-
serve ice-cream vending show are likely
to be. But they were bad enough: a
fifty percent drop in profit to give earn-
ings of only 11.5 percent, the 10 per-
cent dividend cut back from 12 in the
previous year. This is the poorest re-
sult since the company listed in 1959
and is attributed in the report to Mel-
bourne’s late summer, rising costs of
operation, and certain expenses of a
non-recurring kind of which doubtless
we’ll hear the extent in the full report.
One suspects, though this is not men-
tioned, that the intensive competition in
the trade had more to do with Tarax’s
tailing-off than the weather.
One expected a poor result from Sun-
shine Biscuits because it omitted its
interim. These expectations were not
disappointed. In fact, profit for the
year vanished almost to extinction, a
mere $1315 after $122,950 the previous
term and, of course, no final was forth-
coming. It wouldn’t be surprising in
face of this poor result if the company
was gobbled up by one of its bigger
brethren in the biscuit business.
Not so overcast as Sunshine, but still
very much under a cloud, as again
evidenced by its profit and dividend
performance last year, was the enig-
matic Federal Hotels, whose profit
slumped by 50 percent to $171,457,
leaving ordinary earnings a lonely 2.1
percent and shareholders dividendless
for the year. Mr. Markillie, who has
been in a smoky mood recently, what
with a big buyer of the shares pulling
out and himself losing the chair
(though still retaining his seat on the
board), is not there this time to talk
about the fires (three in all) at the
Savoy Plaza in Melbourne. But the
report attributes the poor result partly
to them and the alterations being car-
ried out at the Hotel Federal in Collins
Street. A hopeful note is that trade and
profits in the hotel business are now
stabilising and that you simply can’t
keep on having fires all the time in
any hotel, Federal or otherwise.
As for Drug Houses, whose profit
dropped a mere three percent after
market talk of something much worse
happening, the dividend was held at
ten percent for the third successive
year (after being 11J in 1963-64),
albeit the cover coming down with
earnings at 14.6 as against 15.3 per-
cent in 1965-66.

Iron ore
Hanwright’s program for Pilbara
WESTERN AUSTRALIAN prospect-
ing partners Lang Hancock and Peter
Wright plan to stake everything they
have made or stand to make from iron
and manganese on a new iron-ore ven-
ture in the Pilbara region. They bank
on getting out s44m. in royalties from
Flamersley Iron and Daniel K. Lud-
wig’s Sentinel Mining Co. They hope
to sell these royalties in advance, at a
discount, to be able to put more initial
capital into their Fortescue Valley
scheme than Hamersley Iron did in
getting their highly successful pioneer
venture off the ground.
Three developments in recent weeks
have given Hancock and Wright some
degree of commitment to their scheme:
{1) They have hired for a two-year
term Dr. Bruno Campana, now an in-
dependent geological consultant, but
the man who first went to Western Aus-
tralia five years ago as Rio Tinto’s in-
vestigator of Lang Hancock’s iron-ore
find. He defined the boundaries of the
ores in the region for Rio Tinto (who
later merged with the Zinc Corporation
as RTZ, parent of CRA, parent in turn
of Hamersley Iron); Hancock and
Wright—who will operate their new
venture as Hanwright Iron Mines ■—-
have him under contract to see how
much ore they have and to assess its
grade.
(2) The week after he had taken
Dr. Campana north from Perth, Han-
cock had flown to the United States to
negotiate shipping and financial aspects
of his deal, as well as looking for a
couple of aces to have up his sleeve in
what will be an extremely hard road
for his all-Australian company, as they
hope this one will remain.
(3) A formal agreement with the
State Government was rushed through
before Hancock left. This in itself was
a significant breakthrough, because
{The Bulletin, February 11) Han-
cock’s rationalisation scheme, in run-
ning counter to Charles Court’s philo-
sophy of the North-west, was deliber-
ately over-publicised to provide a back-
drop of public support which appar-
ently has paid off.
Hanwright now are committed to a
$750,000 exploration program to be
finished by mid-1968. Soon afterwards
they must present the State Govern-
ment with evidence that they have
market and finance to get a s7om.
lump-ore scheme under way. They
were given rights over more than 400
square miles of the Hamersleys; this
includes high-grade ore areas. Export
of this lump ore is intended to start
the cash flow for the later stages of the
complex. They believe the first exports
might be possible next year.
The next stage would be to produce
metallised ores and agglomerates in an
sBom. project, using the goethite which
is abundant on their areas. Their slsom.
investment would by then include a
190-mile standard-gauge line running
from the head of the Fortescue Valley
along the Hamersley Range scarp to
Cape Lambert, w'hich would be cost-
shared with Cliffs and Ludwig; Lud-
wig’s National Bulk Carriers ships
w'ould be used to carry the ore to
European markets. At least, all this is
what they hope to be able to pull off.
Meanwhile the original mining con-
cern of the area, the Wittenoom blue
asbestos, would be revived on a vastly
bigger scale, based on the iron-ore
economy, and using the railway de-
signed for ore-carrying. They would
break into the overseas markets by set-
ting up a fabrication plant that would
leave the close-knit asbestos industry
the alternative either of buying from
them or having them compete in the
fabricated-asbestos market.
Finally Hanwright are committed to
production of steel or metallised iron;
for this they would depend on getting
in on the new direct-reduction pro-
cesses, and they have spoken here of
negotiating with Esso, who are experi-
menting with metallising in the United
States.
The whole bold concept depends
to a critical extent on the ability of
Hancock and Wright to join forces with
big, firmly established and experienced
mining and shipping concerns. If they
can do this, backed by the political
force a widely based Australian-owned
mining company could wield, it is just
possible that this brave dream may
come true.
Money market
Good profits again
A FEW YEARS AGO, relations be-
tween the Reserve Bank and operators
in the short-term money market were
so bad that one of them even accused
the bank publicly of “pulling the rug
out from under” the market. But now
that interest rates have been stable for
a while, and an easier tone has come
into the money market (and is to get
easier, according to Trans City Dis-
counts), the money-market men are
making reasonable profits once again,
and relations with the bank seem to
have improved. There’s no doubt
about the better profits, which are
welcome to those public companies
with a stake in the money market.
Mr. C. T. Looker, the new chair-
man of Australian United Corpora-
tion, has yet to reveal the full story,
but the rise from $873,907 to a record
$1,189,936 in the group’s profit (giving
36.9 as against the previous 27.2 per-
cent earnings to cover the repeated
ten percent dividend) must owe a
good deal to the vastly increased
activity of its short-term money-market
offshoot. The Reserve Bank report,
which we have to rely on for the
only round-up of the market’s activi-
ties for the year, shows that overall
its turnover of Government securities
rose by 50 percent to the massive total
of $4lOO million, while dealings in
commercial bills increased by the same
percentage. No figure is given for the
turnover in commercial bills; this
must have been only a fraction of that
of Government securities (of which
Treasury bills accounted for 40 per-
cent). The report says that the mar-
ket’s holdings of commercial bills last
year, which was the second full year
the market has been permitted to hold
such bills, dropped sharply, from s29m.
at the end of the previous year, and
remained around sl3m. for most of
the year before rising to s36m. at
one time toward the end of it.
AUC executives say that the
development of the commercial-bills
market has hung fire. Obviously it
is too akin to the bread-and-butter
business of the trading banks, though
nobody, certainly not Dr. Coombs in
his annual report, is particularly
articulate on the matter.
The high tide of liquidity in the
system last year, especially at the
peak season, flushed a huge additional
flow of money into the short-term
money market. The funds lodged with
it rose from $350 million at the end
of 1965-66 to a peak of more than
$5OO million in April (the rise in the
corresponding period of the previous
year was $9O million). The funds in
the market fell off later in the year
but by the end had climbed to about
$490 million, about $l4O million
higher than a year earlier. Last week
they were back to $461 million.
Dr. Coombs reports that although
the banks made increased use of the
market as a haven of short-term finds
last year, a significant part of the
funds lodged in the market came
from companies.


He collected it just in time for the engagement
party. It was she who thought of insuring it. With
Mutual Life and Citizens. Mutual Life and Citizens
is one of the major Australian insurance companies
whose facts and figures, policy details and
customers' needs are the responsibility of an IBM
computer.
Our lovebirds'affairs with IBM have hardly begun,
though. Each time they sign on the dotted line for
the house of their dreams, with its mortgage, its
bank loan, its insurances—each time they secure
their future with provident or superannuation
funds, hospital benefits, when they buy and insure
a car, the chances are an IBM computer will be
waiting to store away their hopes, their ambitions,
their dreams, and will eventually
return them with interest —on time
for the future.

Mining
Peko-Wallsend in the limelight
OH! TO HAVE SOLD a few thousand
of the recent nickel and iron-ore share
favorites short in the market at the
beginning of last week and bought
them back a couple of days later after
Mr. R. H. Harding, CRA’s investment
manager, had sent an Assembly Hall
audience in the current Junior Cham-
ber of Commerce series of lectures on
investment scurrying home to examine
their mining-share portfolios.
As one listened to Mr. Harding it
seemed he was taking as his text Sir
Maurice Mawby’s remarks, at the AIDA
annual meeting, about mining not be-
ing generally considered respectable
enough. As well as outlining a string of
reasons why mining is a thoroughly
respectable and complex business, he
warned that for a small investor (the
one next to me was biting her finger-
nails) who hasn’t the opportunity to
watch the world economy closely, the
field would remain speculative. Per-
haps the market was overdue for a tech-
nical correction, anyhow, but it does
seem to have read more into Harding’s
paper than he meant it to, because
his reasons why the mining business
(if not necessarily investment in it) is
so respectable were quite convincing.
In the first place, he said, minerals
are fundamental to life, growth in de-
mand for them is “assured and consider-
able,” and a healthy mining industry
must therefore be encouraged. Fur-
ther, mining is basically an international
business; its markets are world-wide.
What is more, the prospects of new
ventures are appraised carefully (some-
thing to perk up the audience) and
(better still) the finances and profits
of established mines are closely con-
trolled. Forward planning for meeting
long-term contracts (the big new
feature of the industry here) and for
repaying loans (heavier than you
think!) and meeting profit targets can
increasingly be relied on.
While most other mining shares in
the limelight lately were laboring in
the wake of Mr. Harding’s remarks,
Peko-Wallsend Investments Ltd., which
strictly speaking is not a mining com-
pany but a holding company in various
N.L. and private companies which are,
blossomed in the sun and looked to be
heading well over its record price of
$4.05 toward the end of last week’s
trading. It kicked off the week by
announcing a record profit of $1,854,810,
or 39 percent higher than the previous
one, and an increase from 16 to 18
percent in its dividend, making the
third successive rise in the payout. All
the capital is in ordinary shares and
the earnings on them in the three latest
years have risen progressively 25.2,
32.7, and now 45.6 percent.
Peko’s profits have reflected the high
prices for the metals its companies pro-
duced in recent years. More than any-
thing else, though, the latest result
relates to those for rutile and zircon
actually mainly from the half-
interest in the Newcastle beach-sands
producer, Rutile and Zircon Mines,
from which Peko received $525,000 in
dividends during the year, compared
with $375,000 the year before. Of
course high copper prices during the
year also had a lot to do with the
good result, despite their easing off
during the year.
What excited the market’s interest
more than all this was the news later
in the week that the company’s newly
opened Juno mine at Tennant Creek
had encountered a rich new ore shoot
in which a 45ft. intersection had as-
sayed 50dwt. gold and o.7dwt. bis-
muth, together with some low-grade
copper, per ton. This was infinitely
better than the last assay values re-
ported from the mine in July. Natu-
rally the board is hopeful that this
will throw up a big increase in ore
reserves when all the testing and further
drilling is completed in several months’
time.
Production at this mine will start in
October and it now looks as if gold
may be the bigger winner in it than
copper, for whose output sales contracts
have already been settled with its pres-
ent Japanese customers. In the mean-
time, development work continues at
the group’s $lO million copper and
gold Warrego project at Tennant
Creek, which is scheduled to come into
production in 1970. Of its present mines
Peko has been producing for the past
13 years, Orlando for five, and the
smaller Ivanhoe mine for two
THE BRIGHTEST spot among oil-
search shares was Woodside, which re-
ported a 4| million cubic feet a day
gas find in its Golden Beach well off the
Gippsland coast. Although the flow is
much smaller than those discovered by
Esso-BHP in Bass Strait from Barra -
couta (10| million) and Marlin (Ill-
million), the well has the advantage
of being much closer (2| miles) from
the coast than the other two. Anyway,
even with all the problems ahead of the
discoveries to turn it into a commercial
proposition, the market put the shares
up to their best level for a long while
but not up to the best reached last

Commodities
Wool prices and overseas economies
THE OBVIOUS SLIDE in Australian
wool prices has occasioned plenty of
domestic comment. Its importance can-
not be too firmly stressed, from both
the. industry and national points of
view. As with earlier price retreats,
Merino types are less affected than
crossbred. The situation has transferred
itself to the London wool terminal
market, where all positions gave a lot
of ground; Sydney wool futures have
also registered losses in very vigorous
dealings.
The chorus of explanation has in-
cluded the Minister for Primary In-
dustry, Mr. C. F. Adermann; the secre-
tary of the Australian Wool and Meat
Producers’ Federation, Mr. A. R.
Johnstone, and the chairman of the wool
committee of the Graziers’ Association
of N.S.W., Mr. F. M. McDiarmid.
All find the principal cause of the de-
cline (which had been well predicted)
in international economic conditions.
“There has been no improvement in
economic conditions in the major wool
using countries for some considerable
time,” Mr. McDiarmid argued. “The
unfavorable economic climate is affect-
ing not only the Australian wool mar-
ket but also the New Zealand and
South African wool market as well as
other pastoral and agricultural com-
modities traded internationally.”
Mr. McDiarmid mentions especially
the secondary influences from Ameri-
ca’s balance of payments deficit, the
precarious British position, and con-
cludes that “in fact, there has been a
downward trend in the price of all
commodities except cocoa.”
Oddly enough, amid the encircling
gloom, New York brokers Merill, Lynch
have chosen this time to predict an
increase in world wool consumption
late in 1967. They then expect a
modest rise in prices, with most firm-
ness among apparel wools. The old
bogy of man-made fibre competition
“will slow the rate of the price in-
crease.”
Exporters’ wool stocks are much
higher than at the start of 1966-67,
while the current season’s production
is expected to move up by one percent
(Australia’s output may be three per-
cent up).
The crucial problem for Australian
growers is the struggle with rising costs.
Most observers do not see any succour
by artificially bolstering prices or with-
holding stocks. And no program can
possibly be based on any feeling that a
long-term rise in wool prices is some-
where round the corner,

polyvinyl chloride resins for industry.
What else do you get for your
money? Geon rigid PVG con-
tainers are shatterproof. And
highly resistant to oxygen and
moisture transfer. They can be
moulded to special sizes and
shapes-in colours or clear.
When you want to cut your
costs of transporting your
pharmaceuticals, call us.
We’re always ready to help.

have stocks totalling 100 million bags
by 1970.
The ICO has spent SU.S.I2 million
on promotion since 1965 and will spend
a further $7-8 million during 1967-68.
THE RECENTLY announced new-
international Wheat Agreement will
almost certainly become effective from
July, 1968. Although it provides for
an increased minimum export price,
ruling overall prices should not be
much affected.
It so happened that the Geneva
negotiations felt they were dealing with
a position of world scarcity. As things
look at present, prospects are beginning
to indicate possibilities of a big sur-
plus. Taking the hint, Chicago futures
have already moved much lower.
The usual doubts are hovering over
the Indian, Chinese, and Russian har-
vests. Elsewhere, the United States will
have a record crop and total European
output should be up by about 10 per-
cent. Argentina’s sowings are also 10
percent higher than last year’s. Canada’s
output will be well down as a result of
heavy drought.
Australia, of course, seems headed
to beat the 1966 record. News has just
come to hand that the Western Aus-
tralian crop has gone in under ideal
conditions and growers are looking to-
ward a record harvest. A Co-operative
Bulk Handling announcement mentions
that “although it is too early to assess
accurately the size of the harvest, CBH
is planning for receivals of up to 140 m.
bushels.”
That figure represents an increase of
nearly 30 percent on last year’s peak
crop. Tractor makers, fertiliser, and
stock firms are beginning to feel par-
ticularly cheerful.
COPPER DOESN’T work free from
turmoil for very long, although last
week’s LME prices did tend to drift
back a little toward the close. The
direction could reverse itself fairly soon
if the market begins to consider the
disturbed political situation in the
Congo. For the Congo mines supply
a lot of copper to Europe and especially
to France and Belgium.
Naturally, the main influence lately
has been the prolonged industry-wide
strike in America, where about 90 per-
cent of copper output has been affected,
together with a portion of lead-zinc
activities. Kennecott’s president, Mr.
Frank Milliken, describes the union
demands as “completely unrealistic”;
the strike has now lasted more than
six weeks.
Significantly, the copper production
lost is said to be above the world sur-
plus of 140,000 tons, earlier predicted
for this year.
Kennecott fortunately succeeded in
establishing a new 15-month contract
(to July 2, 1968) at El T'eniente, Chile,
in late March and without a strike.

SHARE YIELDS AND STATISTICS
A very peremptory air of correction has seized the mining
market and some distinguished tall poppies have been lopped.
An (incomplete) reckoning would certainly include the falls
of Western Mining Corporation $19.90 (down 90 cents), Ham-
ersley $7.20 (40 cents), CRA $8.90 (72 cents), CGA $5.95
(46 cents), and Mount Morgan $3.45 (20 cents). New BH
suffered a full loss of $1.06 in reaching $7.80. One shining
exception was Peko-Wallsend, which finished 53 cents higher
at $3.98. Industrials looked a good deal better, especially toward
the end, although BHP had to shed 10 cents. ACI added 10.

When it’s so darned hot that your office is an
oven, your factory a furnace, your staff slows down.
That’s bad. Bad for production and bad for
profits. What to do? Insulate with SISALATION
heat-reflecting aluminium foil insulation.
Inexpensive Sisalation makes summers 15 degrees
cooler and slashes winter fuel bills up to 40% —-
think what this means in terms of improved
productivity. Everyone works better because they’re
comfortable and happy.
When insulating new or existing offices and fac-
tories, build-in the extra comfort and added weather
protection of Sisalation 450. As an added benefit, when
left exposed as a ceiling surface, its high reflectivity
improves light distribution.
Sisalation 450 has qualities no other foil can match:
it’s guaranteed fire-resistant for life and is double-
reinforced for added strength.
A proved method of insulation, Sisalation 450 is
used extensively in factories, schools, warehouses,
and in cold stores operating at sub-zero temperatures.
Before you spend a cent on insulation in your factory
get the straight facts about SISALATION 450.

THE LAND
End results of ignorance
about Chowilla
SEVENTY MILLION dollars? Perhaps
more? Back in 1962 The Bulletin head-
line in the “Man On The Land” page
was “Grave Doubts on Chowilla £l4
million Dam Project.” So don’t say you
weren’t warned. Since then a lot of
water has flowed through Murray Bridge
and decimals have doubled everything.
But $7O million for a project that we
had grave doubts about back in the
dear old days of the £l4 million esti-
mate? No wonder Sir Henry Bolte has
changed course and New South Wales
and Commonwealth interest is drying
up.
South Australian interests are, under-
standably, bitterly disappointed at the
temporary shelving of further construc-
tion of the Chowilla Dam. But when
Victoria, New South Wales, and the
Commonwealth agreed to contribute a
quarter of the cost each they were
budgeting for £3|- million. The Com-
monwealth might be able to flog off
a VIP plane or two to meet the extra;
the States just do not have that money.
But if the Chowilla Dam is aban-
doned, the blow to South Australia
should not be underestimated. As one
South Australian politician put it last
week: “If Chowilla goes this will be no
place to live in around the year 2000.
We may as well begin to pack up now.”
Even with the Chowilla Dam things
might be tough by the turn of the cen-
tury. Last year the S.A. Engineer-in-
Chief, Mr. j. R. Dridan. predicted that
by 1990 at the latest “South Australia
will have ceased to grow and develop”
unless it was able to use nuclear power
or natural gas power to demineralise
sea water.
Last week The Bulletin reported that
some South Australians were blaming
Victoria for sabotaging the project. It
is unfortunate that these attacks have
continued. In the House of Repre-
sentatives last week Mr. Giles (Liberal)
attacked the Victorian Government for
allowing the pollution of the River
Murray with refuse, effluent, and highly
saline water. He claimed that the pol-
lution was a contributing cause to the
decision to defer the construction of
the Chowilla Dam and that all along
the Victorian side of the river highly
saline water was being allowed to run
into the river. There is a degree of
accuracy in these charges, yet they do
not have much relevance to the decision
to defer the dam construction and the
time for making them is past. Instead
of recriminations, South Australian
spokesmen should be examining the
important technical evidence, beginning
with the fact that the problems of
underground saline water in the Chow-
illa area and of high evaporation could
be potentially dangerous to South Aus-
tralian irrigation farmers.
It has been estimated that the annual
evaporation rate at Chowilla, with its
long, hot summers, could be three feet
or higher. The dam could thus lose
more than a sixth of its capacity in
evaporation each year. The high eva-
poration rate will certainly lift the
salinity of the stored water. It has also
been strongly suggested that the
hydraulic head of water behind the
dam may force subterranean salts into
the downstream flow of the Murray.
Downstream from the Murray at
Chowilla, of course, are the irrigation
areas of Renmark, with their citrus
and stone fruit and grape crops. A
marked increase in the salinity of the
Murray could ruin these crops in a
matter of months.
The postponing of the construction
of the dam is therefore not a story of
all hard lines for South Australian
farmers. The manifest fact is that all
of the Governments involved went into
the deal without adequate knowledge
of the problems facing their engineers
and hydrologists.
It has, of course, long been pointed
out that, to even out the stream flow
of the Murray and provide drought in-
surance for South Australian irrigation
farmers, money might best be spent in
controlling stream flows at their source,
in rehabilitation and afforestation of
the headwaters. This would improve
summer flows and have a number of
healthy economic side-effects higher
up the Murray and its tributary
streams.
If, on the other hand, the major
purpose of the Chowilla Dam is to pro-
vide further irrigation of dry lands in
South Australia, then the authorities
ought to provide an estimate of the
economic gains they expect and balance
these against the cost of building and
maintaining Chowilla. The crops which
further irigation would produce will
not be easily sold here or overseas.
The whole Chowilla project could soon
become part of the subsidies racket,
which is contagious enough.

Recent findings in
animal research
SHEEP WITH badly worn teeth will,
in certain circumstances, produce more
wool than sheep with good teeth. This
finding was made by CSIRO scientists
at Canberra in the course of a study
relating stocking rate, productivity, and
tooth wear.
Merino wethers had been run at
2,4, 6, and 9 per acre for four years.
At the end of this time tooth wear
was pretty well directly related to the
stocking rate. The sheep on the lowest
rate had virtually perfect teeth, but
the teeth of those on the highest rate
had been worn almost to the gums. The
sheep from both these flocks were then
mixed together and grazed for another
two years at the rate of four per acre.
During this period, which covered three
shearings, the sheep with the bad teeth
cut 2.81 b more wool per head than
those with the good teeth.
A possible explanation suggested by
the scientists for this unexpected result
is that the hard struggle for existence
imposed by very high pressure stocking
in early life had taught these sheep to
put more time and effort into foraging.
When they eventually got what to
them was lush grazing, they forged
ahead, whereas the formerly pampered
sheep did not appreciate that they
would have to work harder when their
standard of living fell. The scientists
further speculate that there might be
something to be gained by deliberately
subjecting young sheep to tough con-
ditions. The experience could make
them more efficient producers through-
out the remainder of their lives. But
the economic advantages and dis-
advantages of this idea would need to
be weighed carefully.
Tooth wear is not as rapid on loose,
sandy soils as on hard soils. Apparently,
the sand particles are too large to stick
on the top of the teeth and abrade them
as the sheep chews. The soil particles
are finer in hard country and can
adhere to the teeth. Moreover, when
the pasture is very short, wear also
takes place on the front of the teeth,
which scrape the ground. Clearly, a
hard surface would cause more of this
kind of wear than a loose surface.
Although the experiment at Canberra
was conducted on relatively hard
ground, the sheep sw'allowed amazing
amounts of soil at times: up to 13oz
a day during winter at the high stock-
ing rate. Droppings from these sheep
were 66 percent sand. Even the lightly
stocked sheep had faeces consisting of
nearly 20 percent sand.
Despite such startling figures and the
fact that high stocking rates can cause
teeth to wear away fast, the main con-
clusion from the experiment was that

A.P.M. Research looks
at a small world
Fibres in paper, micro-organisms in soil, the cellular structure of trees.
This is the world of the incredibly small that A.P.M. scientists are
investigating every day.
In the 1920’s Australian scientists set out to find a method of making
paper from Australian eucalypts. These methods are the basis of our
industry today and the pulping of hardwoods is now well established
in all paper-making countries.
The research being done today in A.P.M. laboratories will pay off in
better products, and greater industrial growth tomorrow.
A.P.M. is the leading paper maker in the southern hemisphere. It is
an Australian company owned by over 35,000 Australian investors, em-
ploying over 5,800 people in eight mills throughout the country.
A.P.M. is a forward thinking company which regards scientific research
as the basis of future progress.

good reason. Tobacco specialists in Holland select the world's choicest
tobacco leaves for Amphora blends. Each leaf is masterfully mellowed and
blended to make every pipeful of Amphora consistently excellent. And
downright satisfying. So pick a pouch of Amphora . . . it’s Australia’s
leading imported pipe tobacco and there are three blends to suit all tastes.

farmers should not be deterred by what
happens to the mouths of the sheep,
but go flat out for denser stocking.
Better watch it with breeding sheep,
though. A high rate of tooth wear leads
to prematurely broken-mouthed and
gummy ewes which, under heavy graz-
ing pressure, fail relative to ewes with
good teeth. Fewer lambs and less wool
would result.
YET ANOTHER curious discovery
recently is that the light-red cows of
the dairy shorthorn breed are con-
siderably better milkers than the dark
reds. Likewise, the cows with sleek
coats give more milk than cows with
the woollier type of coat. These rela-
tionships have been established by Mr.
A. V. Schleger, of the CSIRO Division
of Animal Genetics. They parallel
findings made by him and others some
years ago concerning beef shorthorns.
Sleek coats in beef cattle denote fast
weight gain, high fertility, and high
birth weight. However, light-colored
beef cattle tend to wean heavier calves
than their dark-red sisters. In other
words the light-red shorthorns, whether
they be of the dairy or the beef strain,
are better milkers. Dark color in beef
shorthorns is associated with high rates
of weight gain.
The same applies to Herefords and
crosses with Africander cattle. So it
would seem that if you are in beef
go for sleek dark cattle, but if you’re a
dairyfarmer choose the sleek, lighter-
colored stock.
A THIRD STRANGE chance is that
the grass-killing chemical, paraquat,
can be used to improve the feed value
of grass, hay, or dry standing pasture.
Mr. L. J. Hamilton, of the Victorian
Department of Agriculture, has men-
tioned that he has been doing some
spraying trials with this chemical and
has found that the protein content of
the cured grass is very much higher
than untreated grass. As one might ex-
pect, time of application is tricky. If
the grass is sprayed at the early flower-
ing stage it remains rich in protein,
but the total yield of the pasture is
seriously reduced. On the other hand,
spray late and less protein is conserved,
but the total amount of grass is greater.
Overseas studies suggest that very
different results are obtained with
different species. The picture is still
very confused. One thing everyone
agrees about, however, is that stock
simply love pasture or hay that has
been sprayed with paraquat. Everybody
would also agree that the subject
deserves thorough investigation. A
recent report described how gibberellic
acid can be used to boost pasture
growth in winter. If paraquat can be
used to boost pasture quality in sum-
mer-autumn we will have found means
of alleviating the most serious limi-
tations nature has imposed on animal
production in this country.

The country commuters
Mrs. Baillieu
Myer (right) with
Sheelah Wood in
the garden of Mrs.
Myer’s house
One of a Series "Living is an Art"
by SHEELAH WOOD
Elgee Park the lovely Colonial
country house of Mr. and Mrs. Baillieu
Myer, is tucked into the hillside of the
Mornington Peninsula, Victoria, and is
the headquarters of their Santa
Gertrudis and quarter-horse studs.
These Santa Gertrudis were developed
by the King Ranch, Texas. The late
Mr. W. S. Robinson and Sara’s father
were responsible for their introduction
to Australia. The quarter horses were
also the result of careful breeding by
the same ranch. They are bred
primarily as a station stock-horse.
The Myers breed the cattle at Elgee
and then ship them by road transport
to the main property, Yulgilbar, in
northern N.S.W. The quarter horses
sell better in Queensland at the
moment because they are better known
there, but the Myers hope to encourage
interest in Victoria as these horses are
versatile and extremely docile in tem-
perament.
Mrs. Myer flies to Yulgilbar every
six weeks. This means that, with three
houses to run and her yearly trips
abroad, she leads a full and busy life.
She says, “It’s great fun, I love it. But
it does take organising and is only
possible because of the loyal backing
from the people who work for us.”
Mrs. Myer spends her weekends at
Elgee Park with her notebook handy.
On Monday, on her return to her
Melbourne house, she gets the business
of replacements and repairs going
immediately, otherwise, she says, you
don’t get going with the rest of your
week’s commitments. She carries
another notebook with her when she
goes to Yulgilbar and does the same
thing there. The notebooks for each
house are one of the keys to her
efficiency—plus a small filing cabinet
in each house. In these she files every-
thing such as dentist surveys, prescrip-
tions, children’s reports, cuttings, letters,
stock information, and even recipes.
Each house has been built around the
way of living and the entertaining the
Myers do in it. They have a deep freeze
in each house. This means Mrs. Myers
is never caught short in an emergency.
She brings down pre-cooked meals to
the farm, such as casserole dishes, which
include chicken in wine sauces,
macaroni cheese, veal paprika, chicken
and ham, bread, tarts, cakes, and baba
rhums, etc. She always adds fresh
vegetables, herbs, or cream to sauces
when re-heating.
The house at Yulgilbar has just
been completed and is a remodelling
of the house built in the middle of the
last century and designated by the
original owner as a “castle.” They
have kept the stone walls and rebuilt
the house around a courtyard. Mrs.
Myer bought all the furniture in
Mexico. It suits the house as they
are modern reproductions in simple
oiled wood and wrought iron.
Gardening is Mrs. Myer’s great
enthusiasm and she plans her gardens
to suit each house. The house in town
is a green garden of camellias, clipped
hedges, formal pools, and paved areas.
Elgee Park is a country garden of
cascading color over rock walls, and
roses massed in beds close to the
house. She is basically a country
person, adores travelling, but likes to
cut off and relax completely when she
can get out of town. If she could, she
would live permanently in the bush.
Mrs. Myer likes to entertain to dinner
and prefers entertaining in the country

of the house, Samantha, has a simple
wicker bedhead and a Victorian table


on the spur of the moment. She does
not know why, but it always seems
easier. She says that she can always
tell if the party is going well. If not,
she just relaxes, and doesn’t worry.
She always serves one cocktail and
provides a tray of spirits for those who
prefer them. Champagne is her favorite
before-dinner drink and most people
like it. The guests are asked for 7.30
and dine at eight. They arrive on time
or will find their hosts at dinner. The
Myers consider it unforgiveable to be
late without a very good reason.
They are both interested in collect-
ing and supporting modern Australian
artists and have given practical evidence
of this by sponsoring exhibitions by
Donald Friend, Charles Blackman, and
Ray Crooke.

BOOKS
A “fair go” for the artist
who doesn’t go too far
By ROBIN BOYD
The Sydney Opera House Affair.
Michael Baume. Thomas Nelson
(Australia). $3.95.
I FOUND THIS BOOK doubly
fascinating: fascinating at first for what
it said and fascinating in the end for
what it left unsaid.
The task Mr. Baume set himself was
to put down the raw historical facts of
the famous distraught building during
ten years after the competition for its
design was held. He uses Utzon, rather
than the building, as the mast on which
to hang various aspects of the tale. He
takes a quick look at Utzon’s back-
ground and his plan, and then examines
at length his relations with Ove Arup,
the engineer, and with the bureaucrats
and politicians and amateur-clients who
were supposed to be in charge. The
book’s climax is, of course, the drama
of the Utzon resignation and the
protests which followed. After that it
inevitably finishes in anticlimax because
the last chapter, although forecast in a
convincing epilogue written by the new
design architect, Peter Hall, is still
■missing.
Along this tortuous, treacherous pas-
sage, where every step is likely to be
controversial, Mr. Baume treads briskly
with every air of assurance. He almost
succeeds in appearing “unbiassed,” as
the dust-jacket blurb promises, and he
is certainly without malice. It is clear
that he finds Utzon at fault and many
of the other people involved difficult
in various ways dreamy, muddle-
headed, or stodgy but he seldom
uses words even as harsh as those and
he never accuses a soul of dishonesty
or dishonorable intentions. He quotes
at some length from the protagonists in
the course of the text, and almost a
third of the book’s 174 pages consist
of appendices of great value and inter-
est. These include Ove Arup’s address
to his fellow engineers describing the
roof structure, and the fatal Hughes-
Utzon clash in correspondence.
This is, in short, an eminently rea-
sonable and readable book, a reference
work which will remain valuable when
the building is finished, a report which
is sharp, clear, and fair, and practically
without editorial comment.
In fact, I find it hard to imagine
how anyone who was interested enough
to spend six months in research and to
write such a book could so restrain
N.S.W. Works Minister Davis Hughes
himself from an attempt at summing
up, and could allow the narrative after
the dramatic climax merely to trail
off in a long quotation from Ove Arup
and a few statistics (e.g., there are 160
miles of 0.6-inch prestressing strands in
the roof).
There is, as I said, a second level
of fascination in the book, due to its
presumably conscious omissions. Here
is a study of architecture with practi-
cally no mention of architecture, a
book without a trace of passion on a
subject that raised artistic passions al-
most to the boil only a year ago and
has kept them simmering ever since.
Here is a sensible book, steering past
all emotions and many undercurrents
with its head screwed on like a Holden’s
cylinder-head.
While I am not suggesting that such
a book is not valuable or was not
needed, I must note that it leaves the
central mystery not only unsolved but
unmentioned. For there is an absorbing
mystery at the heart of the Sydney
Opera House affair. It is not a who-
dunit. Michael Baume rightly makes
that point in his introduction: “It was
a mess on all fronts . . . but this is
not a story of goodies and baddies.”
The more important mystery is where
Australia herself fits into the mess that
happened. After it is admitted that
Utzon had human weakness, the key
questions are: would this mess, could
this mess, have happened anywhere
else, and are we not more than usually
accident-prone in dealings with inter-
national artists?
The fair-go attitude which permeates
Mr. Baume’s book slips aside only two
or three times to make room for a
word or two which reveal another
quality equally characteristic of Aus-
tralia. He refers, for instance, to
Utzon’s “eccentric perfectionism.”
Another time he says that Utzon
stressed to Davis Hughes “the import-
ance of getting rid of Unilever House”
to improve the environment around the
Opera House. In fact, in the letter
referred to which is (fair enough)
to be found printed in full in the
appendix Utzon merely pleaded for
“the approaches from Unilever House
and the Botanic Gardens (to be)
planned in accordance with the Opera
Utzon, Premier Heffron, and Ove Arup, 1962


House.” In those two rare indications
of partisanship Mr. Baume reveals two
facets of our national attitude to the
artist: an always incipient impatience
and an ever-readiness to chuckle
indulgently at his unworldliness. In a
similar way and, to be as fair as
Mr. Baume, I think this is the only
other example in the whole book
the hint of a curling lip enters into his
description of Utzon’s supporters as
“. . . a group of architects and tradi-
tional liberals.”
I think it is slowly becoming clear
that quite a number of architects who
were on Utzon’s side in the resignation
drama were there not because of un-
qualified belief in the architecture of
his building but because they could not
bear to see Australia once again treat-
ing a visiting artist of the highest
quality with the old familiar insensi-
tivity. To them it was grimly, tragically
humorous to see the old theme repeat-
ing itself, but at larger scale than ever.
The pattern was so familiar. First the
worship of the Overseas Expert; note
that the competition and the jury had
to be international; note the adoration
of the master when he first arrived.
Then the slowly dawning realisation of
the sacrifices involved in attaining full
international standards, while the con-
ditions are made tougher and tougher
for the visitor, and his shortcomings
are tossed around in public debate.
there is the spectacle of the
pack turning on the bewildered once-
master. Utzon’s case was different and
more spectacular, but he was just one
in a procession that is still growing
longer: Griffin, Goossens, Utzon, Dixon,
Ritter . . .
The moral of this book is that Aus-
tralia is ready to give the artist a fair
go so long as he doesn’t go too far.
He should be a bit practical. He should
be as politically cunning as all the rest
of us. “He could have succeeded. Utzon
only needed just a little political nous,”
writes Michael Baume, and again: “If
Utzon had played it Works’ way, had
followed their procedures (he could still
Pro-Utzon demonstrators, March, 1966
Utzon ... end of the dream
have got the sub-contractors he wanted
despite the absurdities of the tender
system), he still could have built the
sort of Opera House he wanted.”
Instead Utzon was a proud man of
ideas and some vanity, his unfamiliarity
with English making all these qualities
sound especially naive. He was unlucky
to pick the lucky country for his
proudest idea.
Among those who were against Utzon
at the showdown were a surprising
number of artists in various fields who
have spent fairly frustrated lives here
knuckling down to the facts of Aus-
tralian life. The spectacle of a foreigner
suddenly trying to impose international
standards was something of a reproach
to them. They joined temporarily with
their own antagonists ifi their resent-
ment of imported perfectionism.
This book, whose design gives it no
great cause to fear such resentment,
does allow credit to Utzon for being
an artist, just as it fairly describes
his unworldliness. It does not, however,
give even passing consideration to the
thought that the kind of qualities he
tried to bring here might be worth, in
the long run, substantially greater sac-
rifices than we are at present prepared
to make.
Life's compromises
By JOHN BAXTER
The Arrangement. Elia Kazan. Collins.
$3.85.
IN HIS FIRST novel, * “America,
America,” Kazan described the prob-
lems faced by one of his ancestors in
leaving Anatolia at the turn of the
century and settling in the United
States. The same man is present in
“The Arrangement,” now old and close
to death but, despite this, exercising
a powerful influence over the novel’s
central character, his son Eddie, and
therefore over the whole story.
Eddie Anderson has never entirely
understood his father, nor his feelings
about him. The compromises Eddie has
made to fit in with the life his father
thought he should lead—prosperous,
commercial, ostentatiously affluent
have not really resolved the conflict
between the old Armenian rug dealer
and his creative and essentially Ameri-
can son. The two men have, however,
come to an arrangement.
It is not the only arrangement in
their lives. Kazan suggests, in fact, that
all our lives are made up of arrange-
ments, the most important of them be-
ing, as he puts it, “the relation that
has been worked out between the way
in which one sees things and the way
one lives them . . . the link between
the ideal that one has, and that one
wants to follow, and the world in which
we must live.”
Eddie and his father have compro-
mised. Eddie also has an arrangement
with his creativity, moonlighting politi-
cal articles from his job in an ad
agency; and with his wife, on whom
he cheats with an almost dogged regu-
larity.
This system of checks and balances
works only as long as everybody plays
the game, and it takes only one revo-
lutionary act on Eddie’s part to destroy
it completely. His meeting with Gwen,
sensuous and sexually accomplished,
begins an affair that slowly corrodes
Eddie’s interest in maintaining the
arrangement with his wife, until her
discovery of some pornographic pic-
tures taken of the couple destroys it
completely.
A precarious compromise is patched
up between them, involving their abdi-
cation from any real social contact ex-
cept with each other, but sexual pres-
sure and the essential unreality of the
situation destroy it after a few months.
Kazan’s handling of the process is more
than competent, and his delineation of
a marriage in decay is a subtly disturb-
ing piece of social analysis.
After one arrangement has been
smashed, there is no encouragement to
maintain the others, all of which Eddie
dissolves with almost gleeful dispatch.
His job, his connection with the politi-
cal magazine, the ties that bind him to
his father; all are severed with decisive
strokes. He even takes, subconsciously,
the next logical step and tries to kill
himself, destroying his arrangement
with death.
Eddie eventually finds his way
through the web of conflicting loyalties
which make up his world and comes
to an arrangement which, unlike the
others he has entered, allows for his
vision of himself and his reason for
living, but the process is as long and
painful a one as rebirth. He has, in
fact, become a totally new person, sug-
gesting that Kazan may feel that to
destroy one’s arrangement is, in a sense,
to commit suicide. Looking over the
author’s history and his frequent
changes of occupation—actor, director,
producer, writer it seems possible
that the novel is a kind of mental auto-
biography, part of yet another arrange-


Elia Kazan ... cool million
ment, one which Kazan has made with
himself and his public, and an impres-
sive one financially, as Kazan will pro-
duce and direct his book as a film for
a cool million dollars plus half the
profits.
“The Arrangement” is long, a
quarter of a million words, but by no
means hard reading, despite its occa-
sionally tedious style. Why this is so
does not reveal itself under literary
analysis, indicating that this is probably
not a book best judged in literary
terms. Totally lacking in the didactic
material on which most modern novels
lean, it concerns itself deeply and in-
cisively with a philosophical and
psychological state common to us all.
Whether we read it to have our cynic-
ism endorsed or our complacency
shaken, “The Arrangement” is certainly
worth the effort of ingestion.
Developing poets
By VIVIAN SMITH
Wodwo. Ted Hughes. Faber, $4.25.
QUESTIONS OF POETIC continuity
and productivity are of more interest
to practitioners than readers, but Ted
Hughes’ “Wodwo” makes clear some
of the problems that face the develop-
ing poet in the modern world. Mr.
Hughes began with an unusual gift
for images, and a highly personal range
of subject matter. “Wodwo,” his first
book for eight years, shows how he
has tried to intensify and extend his
range and to enrich his poetry by de-
ploying his skills in other fields, par-
ticularly by writing short stories and
plays. One might say that “Wodwo”
presents us with the process of the
development rather than with the
strictly selected results of it, though the
author justifies publishing stories, play,
and poems together by saying:
“The stories and the play in this book
may be read as notes, appendix, and
unversified episodes of the events be-
hind the poems, or as chapters of a
single adventure to which the poems are
commentary and amplification. Either
way, the verse and the prose are in-
tended to be read together, as parts of
a single work.”
However useful this arrangement
may have been to the author, the reader
will be most interested in single poems.
They don’t seem to me to add up to
such an impressive achievement as
“Lupercal,” but “Ghost Crabs” is
remarkable, one of the best things
Hughes has done; and there are half a
dozen other pieces here not far behind it
in vigor and intensity.
To begin with
It looks like rocks uncovering, mangling
their pallor.

Falls back from its productions,

Books in brief
Monumental walkabout
Australia, World of Difference. John
Bechervaise. Rigby. $4.95.
JOHN BECHERVAISE, already known
as a writer on Antarctica, here inde-
fatigably explores the mountains, lakes,
flora, fauna, and climatic pecularities
of Australia. Anyone who wants to know
about the construction of Ayers Rock,
the contours of the cliffs along the
Great Australian Bight, or the beauties
of the green tree-ant will be entirely
satisfied by a wander or a brisk dip
—in these pages. On the cities Mr.
Bechervaise is less interesting (his com-
ments on Sydney and Melbourne don’t
add anything new or striking to the
existing literature), and his prose style
seldom really gets off the ground; but
his dogged and sometimes enthusiastic
records should provide a handy compen-
dium for the traveller.
A cultural carthorse
Prepositions. Louis Zukovsky. Rapp and
Carroll. $4.70.
“THERE EXISTS probably in the
labors of any valid artist the sadness
of the horse plodding with blinkers and
his direction is for all we don’t know
filled with the difficulty of keeping a
pace.” This sentence is excruciatingly
typical of Louis Zukovsky, a notable
example of critical plodding with
blinkers, the spavined carthorse of
American culture for more than 30
years. His tortuous animadversions on
William Carlos Williams, Lewis Car-
roll, Ezra Pound, and Henry Adams,
among other well-worn subjects, deli-
vered in a humorless falsetto, are with-
out exception syntactically and stylisti-
cally abysmal. Sample burst: “The
dream-world of Carroll’s ‘Alice in
Wonderland’ and ‘Through the Look-
ing Glass’ has never offended predatory
interests because they are too callous
or too stupid to notice that the guile-
lessness of his nonsense exists on a
tangent departing at some point of the
periphery of sense. Carroll ultimately
refused to commit himself as to
whether his nonsense had any overt
meaning.” So, hopefully, does Louis
Zukovsky.
Superior piety
The Polite Americans. Gerald Carson.
Macmillan. $6.40.
GERALD CARSON’S investigation
of the manners and the morals,
when they become merely questions of
manners, as they often do—of Ameri-
cans is almost too much of a good
thing. The early chapters, “The Col-
onial Inheritance,” give a vivid picture
of how in the early days some people
sought to rise above the crowd, even
though their claim to superior piety
was the only way they could do so.
Mr. Carson does not draw much on
the material about the self-made mil-
lionaires of the last century, probably
feeling they have already been well
documented. And what conclusion can
he reach about the levelled-off twen-
tieth century, except: “A mannerly
youth says ‘Can you go to the movies
Saturday night?’ not ‘What are you
doing Saturday night?’ ”
The stickyheaks
The Intruders: the invasion of privacy
by Government and industry. Senator
Edward V. Long. Praeger. $5.95.
SENATOR LONG HAS been riding
for some time on a privacy platform,
and he here crisply records the activities
of snoopers in America: one executive
of a firm even hid a microphone in a
tissue container in a ladies’ room.
“People in America,” Senator Long
claims, “are finding themselves the tar-
get of the eavesdropper and the busy-
body.” An olive with a toothpick may
contain a tiny transmitter, with the
toothpick as its antenna: “immersed in
a martini it could broadcast the length
of a city block.” Picture-frames also
can hide transmitters, and you should
also examine staplers, lamps, and car-
pets. Managing directors can snoop on
their employees or rivals, tax-men can
see if companies are dodging taxes, the
police can arrange for certain hotel
rooms to be bugged and suspected
criminals booked by the management
into those rooms only. After reading
his book, we will never be able to look
a toothpicked olive in the eye with
equanimity again.

Spoiling Tasmania's scenery
In considering the despoliation of
scenic, biological, and natural sport-
ing highlights, you published a good
succinct summary (8., July 22) of
points against the single-minded excess
development by Tasmania’s sacred cow,
its Hydro Electric Commission.
The level of Lake St. Clair a
national park—has been raised by a
dam wall, killing bordering trees and
bushland and interfering with the
natural environment. On the other
hand, as a measure of desperation and
bad planning the HEC in dry times has
had to build pipes into this magnifi-
cent lake to pump out the water to
feed its powerhouses farther dowm the
Derwent River (which rises at Lake
St. Clair).
The Shannon River of the Great
Lake, and the Ouse River, into which
it flowed, have been diverted to the
north, finally rushing from the tur-
bines of Trevallyn powerhouse into the
brackish waters of the Tamar River, of
use only for Bass Strait shipping. Pre-
viously, these were the main tributaries
of the Derwent River, up which the
sea water has consequently encroached,
interfering with established fresh-water
use. The diversion of rivers means they
no longer form stock barriers in the
steep valleys forming boundaries be-
tween properties. But there has been no
flood control.
Details of the points raised in your
article could be elaborated ad nauseam
to show lack of safeguard for other
water-users, and lack of information as
to what is being planned with the tax-
payers’ money.
In the same way as the Snowy Moun-
tains Scheme provides water mainly for
irrigation, and takes advantage of the
fall to also generate electricity, water
could have been controlled from the
central plateau to provide very useful
irrigation as well as power, which is now
the only product. The Premier, Mr.
Reece, conveniently overlooks this and
constantly claims that the Snowy
Scheme is to produce electricity but
the Tasmanian schemes are bigger and
cheaper! Does he intend to tunnel the
rivers flowing wasted into the west
under the central highlands for use in
the dry midland plains and south-east?
This unbalanced development of
water resources for hydro-electricity
alone means that other water-users and
future potential water-users suffer.
There is no apparent integrated
development plan for agriculture
(irrigation for crops, irrigation for feed,
stock use), domestic supplies (rural
townships), or tourism (natural
scenery, constant-level lakes for water
sports). Agriculture and tourism must
be at least as important to Tasmania as
they are to New Zealand. It is disturb-
ing to note that the Ministries in these
two important fields are held by one
man, Mr. Atkins. The Premier himself
is the Minister for the HEC.
We all know that water is not the
only source of electrical power. Its
economic advantage is with peak load
due to domestic use associated with
big cities. There are no big cities in
Tasmania. What does the power come
from, for example, which drives the
giant industrial complexes at Port
Kembla and Newcastle? For many years
the Tasmanian Government insisted
that thermal power had no use in that
State. Coalmines have had to close as
there has been insufficient development
to use the coal being produced.
Recently the Government has announc-
ed that it will build a thermal power
station!
The dream of the HEC for a cable
to carry electricity across Bass Strait
is a most important concept. Tas-
manian hydro-electricity would be of
use in meeting peak loads in the Vic-
torian cities. But, possibly as important,
power could also be sent the other way.
The ruinous exploitation of Tasmania’s
rural and wilderness lands, and water
resources, could be controlled.
Tasmania urgently needs a powerful
representative Water Resources Auth-
ority which will decide how much
water to allocate for electricity pro-
duction, where water is more than use-
fully applied on a long-term basis to
other uses, and to co-ordinate the use
of the same water for more than one
activity as was done by the Snowy
Mountains Authority.
While the record of Tasmania
appears good in relation to the propor-
tion of the State as parks and reserves,
this is not so in effect. The policy is
to treat an area as a reserve only while
commercial gain cannot be made from
it, and only until someone wants to
“develop” it.
The present plight of Lake Pedder
National Park fighting for survival, as
mentioned in The Bulletin, is only a
facet of the potential despoliation for
commercial benefit of the whole Tas-
manian south-west area, in which it
lies. It is not very big compared to
the area of Australia, but it is unique
to Australia (indeed, to the world). As
such it must be preserved for its
scientific and recreational interest by
the Commonwealth of Australia. It
should become a national National
Park.
Mainland States and Federal authori-
ties must take a part in the natural
conservation of the buttongrass plains
and their surrounding mountains.

CRAVEN FILTER
belongs to the world of today
Sailing a twelve metre yacht off Sydney Heads, or Newport,
Rhode Island, is strictly for men only —men of experience. It
is not a sport for the very young. Much the same with Craven
Filter cigarettes—they are not intended to appeal to everybody.
Craven Filter is especially blended to give mild, satisfying
enjoyment to people with mature tastes in their food, wine,
cigarettes. For these people Craven Filter belongs to the world
of today.
