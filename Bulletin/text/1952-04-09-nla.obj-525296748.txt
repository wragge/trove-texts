LEGEND SAYS A MERMAN LIVED
IN ORFORD'S ANCIENT CASTLE
CJOUTH of Aide burgh, on the Suffolk
coast, stands the village of Orford,
which possesses a massive Norman
castle, one of the finest in Britain and
now preserved as an ancient monument.
Built in the eleventh century, it stands
upon an earthworks which was designed
as part of the defence system. In its early
days the castle was the cause of much
strife between opposing factions, and
until the end of the thirteenth century it
served as the stronghold of men who
defied the forces of law and order. The
fortress has weathered the centuries and
is still in such a good state of repair that
the living conditions of a besieged
garrison can be readily visualised.
Grford’s outer defences are polygonal
in shape and circular within, resembling
in this respect the Castle of Odiham in
Hampshire, which was built about the
same period. The three flanking towers
are square, and from the highest battle-
ments in bygone days flared a beacon
which guided ships sailing along the
treacherous coast-line.
One of the legends connected with
Orford Castle is recorded in the ancient
Chronicles of Baker and of Ralph de
Coggeshall. According to these records
some Orford fishermen, in 1180, caught
in their net a merman, or fish “having
the shape of a man at all points.” It was
taken to the castle, where it was kept for
six months ; for food it preferred raw
fish, but it would eat meat. On one
occasion it was, according to the legend,
taken to church, but at length it escaped,
took to the sea and was never seen again.
The inn shown in the foreground of
the accompanying illustration is the
Crown and Castle, a favorite rendezvous
of George Crabbe, the famous eighteenth-
century poet.

AUSTRALIAN ORCHIDS.
It is a little disconcerting to find in the
opening page of Rica Erickson’s Orchids
of the West (Paterson, Brokensha Pty.,
Ltd., Perth) the orthodox scientific view-
point, “Man uses them [flowers] freely,
little thinking that all their loveliness,
scent and wealth of color were evolved
solely for the wedding of pollen to
stigma.” This is that limited scientific
view of nature recently so ably
criticised in Man or Matter, by Dr.
Ernst Lehrs, who, following Goethe,
prefers to believe that if a plant produces
beauty as well as a sexual mechanism
then one should presume that that is
precisely what it is trying to do ; the
evolutionary process is trying to be
beautiful as well as merely reproductive.
But Miss Erickson certainly hasn’t
written Orchids of the West merely from
the scientific viewpoint but with
a genuine nature-lover’s affection
for these most fascinating flowers of the
Australian bush. With a wealth of
scientific knowledge taken partly from
her own observation, partly from such
authorities as Edith Coleman and Robert
D. Fitz Gerald (the grandfather of the
poet, formerly Deputy Surveyor-General
in N. S. Wales), at all times she is aware
not merely of the ingenuity of the
mechanism but the beauty of the flower,
and, particularly, the strangeness of
flower and mechanism which is the
dominating characteristic of the orchid.
“It is hard not to think of these plants
as active, intelligent beings,” she writes,
“when their mechanisms appear to be the
result of knowledge, planning and artful
preparation of a means to an end.”
Darwin, she recalls, described a South
American orchid which used to get itself
fertilised by means of a “slippery slide”
from which a bee would be jostled by its
fellows, like a sheep into the dip, over
the edge into the bucket-like labellum.
But many of the Australian orchids have
habits just as odd, even odder.
The greenhood, beaked and horned like
some freakish green bird or prehistoric
reptile, is “a prison-trap with a spring-
hinged door”:
The astonishing fact is that, having
having trapped an insect, each greenhood
offers escape by way of a special tunnel
leading out through the top of the flower,
and should the insect fail to find its way
along this narrow passage the trapdoor
reopens after 20 minutes or more.
The duck orchid, which Fitz Gerald
thought looked like a bulldog-ant and
which Miss Erickson —the West has
apparently improved on the N. S. Wales
name —calls the flying-duck, is another
of these traps for young players: its
“head,” when touched by an insect,
makes a “somersault dive” into the pouch
below and completely closes the opening.
It is this habit of trapping insects, prac-
tised by some other species as well, some-
times intentionally and sometimes by
accident, which has led, says Miss Erick-
son, to the libel that orchids eat their
prisoners. Apparently that charge is
false. They do, however, encourage a
certain amount of regrettable drunken-
ness in the insect world: the gnat which
fertilises the greenhood is lured into the
spring-trap by a “sublime drink” hidden
in the tissue at the base of the spring
door. An inexperienced or sober-minded
gnat, finding itself shot into the prison
with the door closed behind it, will
instantly set off up the escape-tunnel, but
“a seasoned old toper is unconcerned. It
has been initiated before and has per-
formed its duties. It may even continue
to imbibe the heavenly nectar, and by the
time the door reopens may become quite
drunk. They can be found lying helpless
inside some greenhoods, providing a
basis for the untrue assertions sometimes
made that greenhoods eat insects.”
Quite the strangest story Miss Erickson
tells is that of the slipper orchid, known
elsewhere as the large-tongue orchid, a
dramatic reddish flower with strong
green leaves which grows in swampy
places or out of mossy crevices in the
rocks and which looks like a snake with
its red tongues darting from the stem, or,
when you pick it and stand it inverted on
its long “legs,” like a grasshopper: this
extraordinary flower, says Miss Erickson,
quoting Edith Coleman, actually mates
with an insect, the male ichneumon fly ;
or, to be precise, induces the fly to
attempt to mate with it so that it" may
deposit on its abdomen the pollinia to be
carried to the next slipper orchid.
The flower is presumed to emit the
same “mysterious attraction” by which
the female ichneumon fly summons her
lover from long distances; and when
Edith Coleman placed slipper orchids
and ichneumon flies of both sexes in a
jar the males, on some occasions, pre-
ferred the flowers to their rightful
spouses. The same incredible behavior
is darkly suspected of several other
species of orchids, notably diuris sul-
phurea (one of the doubletails, or donkey
orchids, studied by Edith Coleman in
Victoria) and some of the spider orchids
among the caladenias, including the
dragon orchid, which is pollinated by
wasps.
Miss Erickson’s curiosities include the
beard orchid, one variety of which —the
smaller of two kinds which grow along
the roadsides in the N. S. Wales Blue
Mountains —has a pair of beady black
“eyes” to complete its resemblance to
Henry the Eighth; the underground
orchid, of which two species have been
found, one in the West and one in N. S.
Wales ; the leek orchid, which grows tali
as a man ; the hare orchid, which has so
completely adapted itself to its Australian
environment that it flowers most pro-
lifically after bushfires, feeding on ash
for its blooms; and then all sorts of
lovely little creatures with such enchant-
ing names as bell-sun orchid, leopard
orchid, cat’s-face, nannygoat, frog green-
hood, bunny orchid, king-in-his-carriage,
rattlebeaks, white fairy and babe-in-a-
cradle.
Though some of the species are con-
fined to W.A., many of them are so wide-
spread that the book, besides its intrinsic
interest to nature-lovers everywhere,
would serve for a handbook for
amateur orchid-hunters in other States
(tropical Queensland excluded); and for
that purpose it will be found admirable.
As well as descriptions of the flowers
and anecdotes about them, it has the
author’s own excellent illustrations in
color, making identification very easy;
and it has this great advantage over most
orchid-books, which are usually in de
luxe editions, that it is small, compact
and inexpensive.
Tasmanian Tactics.
Lytton Strachey might have made three
brilliant and amusing essays of The
Struggle for Self - Government in
Tasmania, 1842-1856, by W. A. Townsley,
Senior Lecturer in History and Political
Science, University of Tasmania (Tas-
manian Government Printer); but Mr.
Townsley addresses a more specialised
audience of historians and students.
Nevertheless, it is easy enough for the
reader looking for entertainment to run
through Mr. Townsley’s painstaking tabu-
lation of facts, first about Lieutenant-
Governor Sir Eardley Wilmot, former
English squire and M.P., who began
governing Tasmania when a boom was
developing into a depression because of
inflation, and when the Legislative
Council, of which six were Government
officials and eight were citizens nominated
by the Governor, was growing restive at
being little better than a rubber-stamp
for the decisions of the Executive
Council, six officials headed by the
Governor.
Refused money by the Colonial Office,
Wilmot borrowed, and then sought to
increase taxes; whereupon a “patriotic
six” members of the Legislative Council
called for details of deficits, criticised
salaries paid to Convict Department
officials, and lamented that the ending
of transportation to N. S. Wales had
brought 4000 convicts a year for Tas-
mania to provide for; and finally, on
the ground that the Lieutenant-Governor
had no right to vote in committee,
resigned at the beginning of November,
1845.
Wilmot replaced the resigned members,
but a year later was himself recalled by
the Colonial Office, a private dispatch
from Gladstone referring to his “moral
laxity,” a matter on which Strachey might
have been expected to expatiate; but,
says jMr. Townsley:
This is not the place to relate the story
of a notable event in the history of the
colony or to discuss either the method or
reason for the recall. These have been dealt
with quite effectively elsewhere.
Sir Eardley died in Tasmania in 1847,
awaiting news that evidence sent to
London would restore his good name;
meanwhile to his successor, Sir William
Denison, had fallen the delicate task of
replacing the replacements to the Legis-
lative Council with the original resignees ;
and then, in response to increasing public
demands, of replacing the Legislative
Council itself with eight nominees and
sixteen members elected by the people.
This “Blended Council” was elected in
1851.
This new Council provided a demon-
stration of the difficulty of mixing officials
with free men. The new Colonial Secre-
tary, Henry Samuel Chapman, and the
Clerk of the Executive Council, Adam
Turnbull, were both nominee-members
of the Legislative Council. They were
both convinced that Tasmania would be
better-off without transportation, but were
expected, as good servants of Govern-
ment, to do everything possible to defeat
a motion to this effect. Chapman
absented himself from voting ; Turnbull
voted against transportation. Looking
at the problem from now, it is obvious
that Chapman and Turnbull had no
course open to them but resignation ; but
men with their livelihoods at stake find a
thousand moral arguments for taking a
wrong means to a right end ; and the
course of the affair, as traced in detail
by Mr. Townsley, makes one of the
most interesting and moving problems-of-
conscience in Australian history.
In 1853, Van Diemen’s Land was de-
clared no longer a penal colony, and in
September of that year a Select Com-
mittee of the Legislative Council reported
that it had drafted a new Constitution ;
and a Constitution Bill was introduced
to provide for an elective Upper and
Lower House, the Upper House
franchise to be based on property-owner-
ship. The Government side of the Legis-
lative Council countered with an Exten-
sion Bill, to extend the membership of
the “Blended Council” so that it might
have a more representative opinion on
the new Constitution.; and the battle
seesawed for a year, and became a tactical
race to determine which side should get
its bill through first. The Extensionists
won —the Council was extended on
Monday, but abolished on the Tuesday
week. Both sides claimed the victory, but
the Colonial Office accepted the Consti-
tution Bill. The two-chamber Parlia-
ment of Tasmania met on December 2,
1856.
In the interval between passing of the
Constitution Bill and election of the two-
chamber Parliament, the old Blended
Council proved very much alive, demand-
ing that Dr. Hampton, Comptroller-
General of the Convict Department, be
brought to the bar of the Council to be
examined on the use by private persons
of convict labor and Government
materials. Dr. Hampton not attending,
they sent the Sergeant-at-Arms to appre-
hend him. The Government referred the
case to the Supreme Court; mobs rioted ;
Dr. Hampton, held in custody in his own
house by the Sergeant-at-Arms, escaped
to Sydney; the court ruled against the
Legislative Council; the case was
appealed to the Privy Council, which
said that the laws and customs of the
British House of Commons were not
assured to the Colonial legislature merely
by the introduction of British Common
taw there.
In 1858, when this decision was
announced, the new House of Assembly
passed an Act which
.... empowered the Houses to order the
attendance of witnesses and to punish sum-
marily for contempts. It specified the form
of warrant. It required the sheriff, con-
stables and other officers to assist in the
apprehension of any person named in the
warrant. It permitted the breaking open
of doors in daylight to seize any such
person. It laid down that the Supreme
Court could not examine the grounds of any
such warrant on habeas corpus or otherwise.
Finally it gave them the power to direct
the Attorney-General to prosecute....
To have remembered this would have
explained a lot when Senator McKenna
was trying to make heads of the Com-
monwealth Defence Force attend the
Senate against their instructions from the
Government in the Representatives . . .
In Tasmania they take that sort of thing in
with their Glaxo ; and for the Tasmanian
Senator to have succeeded in such a com-
plicated variation on a simple theme
would have assured him not only of a
place, but of first-place, in the records of
his political forefathers.
Pushkin.
Foreign poets are always difficult to
get at, even when they are translated,
Russians most of all; and this reviewer’s
acquaintance with Pushkin did not really
begin until he met Doha Ribush, the
Russian producer of plays who died in
Melbourne a year or two ago ; Ribush
used to say, with one of his heaves of
the shoulders expressing the inexpressible,
“Ah, Pushkin! ...” f .
It was enough ; and on the whole there
was much more in that “Ah, Pushkin!”
than there is in R. H. Morrison’s Lyrics
from Pushkin published in English and
Russian by the Meanjin Press, Melbourne.
Ihe book opens with one quite charming
lyric entitled “Night”:
For thee my voice breaks forth, fond
languid words are spoken;
Thus yearningly the silence of the late dark
night is broken.
Beside my lonely couch the dismal candle
shines;
Confused and murmuring, my verse's wilful
lines,
Filled with thy being, in a stream of love
go flowing.
Before me in the dark I see thy bright eyes
glowing,
They smile at me, 1 hear thy words for me
alone;
“My friend, my dearest friend : . . my
love . . . thine own . . . thine own.”
But the rest is mostly lost in faded,
conventional adjectives and weak versifi-
cation relying too much on inversions for
the rhymes;
O lingering storm-cloud, the tempest is
lifting,
Alone you remain through the clear azure
drifting,
Alone you are trailing your shadow forlorn,
Alone do you sadden this rapturous morn.
A handful of tiny lyrics and epigrams
must in any case be an inadequate rep-
resentation of a poet who wrote tremen-
dous narrative poems under the influence
of Byron; the tragedy of “Boris
Godunov” in an attempt to introduce the
Shakspearian drama into Russian litera-
ture ; novels, histories, lyrics by the
score ; and who, besides scraping through
various political conspiracies at the peril
of his life and fortune, eventually dis-
tinguished himself by becoming one of
the very few poets ever to be killed in a
duel. Ah, Pushkin . . .
A Prison Warden.
San Quentin, The Story of a Prison,
by Clinton T. Duffy, as told to Dean
Jennings (Peter Davies), is not as good
a book as Donald Powell Wilson’s My
Six Convicts (B. 12/9/’51); neither
Warden Duffy nor his ghost has the
analytical brain or insight into character
of a psychologist like Dr. Wilson; they
substitute a kind of journalistic emotion-
alism for Wilson’s more philosophic
tone ; nevertheless Warden Duffy, as the
architect of the new deal at San Quentin
prison, California, knows more, and has
done more, than Dr. Wilson about prison
life ; and if emotionalism is necessary to
ease shoulders constantly rubbing against
those of convicts and temporary inmates
of condemned cells, Warden Duffy
certainly deserves it.
Son of a farmer who became a warder,
Duffy was born in a white house in the
village which constitutes San Quentin
prison ; in 1929, after trying his hand at
various outside jobs, including the
Marines in World War I, he became a
clerk in the office of Warden James B.
Holohan ; and, while still in this junior
job, received a ’phone-call from the Gov-
ernor’s secretary which would have re-
prieved a man from hanging if the trap
hadn’t fallen at that moment, and over-
looked a document which would have
stayed the execution of another —a
particularly grisly execution it had turned
out to be, the trap failing for the first
time ip the prison’s history. This second
instance almost got him the sack: he
uses both as arguments against capital
punishment.
He was a little man with a big head
and big ideas, and anxious to learn from
his mistakes; when the liberal-minded
Holohan, bashed by escapees and worse-
worried in spirit by the discovery that
the convicts were making counterfeit cur-
rency with the photo-engraving equip-
ment he had secured them, and selling
the potassium cyanide at high prices to
prison suicides, resigned and was replaced
by tough-guy Smith, Duffy became
assistant to the prison secretary. For
four years Smith’s guards whipped
recalcitrants in San Quentin’s ancient,
lightless, lime-strewn dungeon, a black
tunnel fifty feet long, where they slept on
the stone floor with one blanket if they
were lucky, water dripping from the ceil-
ing, no ventilation, no lavatories; and
Duffy took notes. A new chairman of
the Parole Board began to inquire;
Governor Olsen appointed a new board
of prison directors, and at their first
meeting, in 1940, they sacked Smith and
asked Duffy to take over for thirty days
—which have extended at least to the
time of writing of this book.
On his first day as Warden, Duffy fired
six guards, banned whips, straps and
rubber hoses; painted out the nine-inch
circles where prisoners had been forced
to stand motionless for hours at a time,
abolished numbered clothing, walked
alone among the prisoners in the big yard,
the first time a warden had ventured there
without an armed guard, attended the
prisoners’ mess-room and told me
steward to put beef in the beef -stew next
day, also dumplings. Later he put in fresh-
water showers to replace “dirty salt-water

SALYAGE SAGA
by
STANDBY
(R.S.PORTEOUS)
WE saw her first at 4.30
one morning, sil-
houetted against the
faint light of dawn.
Barton, the chief-officer, and I
were on the bridge, and for a
few minutes we took her for one
of those high-sterned junks with
a few canoes clustered near by.
Natives fishing, we guessed. We
were in the Flores Sea, only a
few hours’ steaming from the
Wetar Straits, and in those
waters one sees all manner of
weird-looking craft.
Barton raised his binoculars.
He was yawning, just mildly
interested. For my part I was
thinking only of an early-
morning cup of tea when
Barton suddenly exclaimed:
“Good God! That’s a
steamer going down by the head.
Those are her lifeboats standing
by. Call the captain.” He
jangled the engine-room tele-
graph a couple of times and
slammed the pointer to “Stand
by.”
I went down the ladder at top
speed. Captain Coleridge wasn’t
a man who overlooked slovenli-
ness. He was a hard, arrogant
old devil who kept everyone,
particularly us unfortunate
apprentices, continually on the
jump. In the old days, before
steam was invented, masters of
ships were officially referred to
as “Master under God” —mean-
ing, I suppose, that at sea the
captain was the supreme power,
responsible to God alone.
Coleridge didn’t even concede
God’s overriding authority.
Aboard his ship he was God.
We hated him. We hated his
lordly arrogance, his ability to
make each one of us feel more
useless than the ship’s cat, but
we grudgingly admired his sea-
manship. In professional matters
he was never in the slightest
doubt, never wrong.
The clanging of the telegraph
must have wakened him, for as
I was about to knock on his
door he shouldered me aside and
ran up the bridge ladder. It was
typical of him that he didn’t
waste one second in questioning
a mere apprentice, but made
straight for the bridge, where he
could speak directly to the officer
of the watch and at the same
time see the trouble for himself.
He took charge immediately,
slowing the Netherdale down,
ordering ladders to be lowered,
and finally bringing us to a stop
within easy hailing distance of
the lifeboats.
ONE expects to see a ship
foundering in a gale, with
mountainous seas pounding her,
threatening to swamp the life-
boats, and making rescue work
hazardous. There is a rightness
about such a scene. It is in keep-
ing with the tragedy of ship-
wreck.
But our rescue wasn’t at all
like that. The hot brilliance of
the rising sun shimmered over
a sea that was like an expanse
of taut-stretched silk. Not a
wave, not even the faintest cats-
paw of wind marred the perfec-
tion of its gleaming surface. The
boats below us might have been
making a social ship-to-ship call
in port, so quietly did they drift
alongside. The upturned faces
of the coolies at the oars were
completely impassive, devoid of
all expression, even of interest
in us, their rescuers.
There was something ludicrous
and faintly theatrical about the
scene. It was like a shot from
an inferior and highly improb-
able film, so that one almost
expected to see a glamorous
blonde lolling beside a handsome
young officer in the stern of
No. 1 boat. Instead there was
only a thin, pathetic-looking
old gentleman in crumpled blue-
and-white striped pyjamas. It
was farce rather than tragedy.
But half a mile away, like a
backdrop to this scene, the
abandoned steamer provided all
the necessary tragedy. She was
listing so heavily to starboard
and was so far down by the head
that we wondered whether she
would roll right over or plunge
bows-first from our sight. She
did neither. She just lay there,
leaning over her own reflection,
with her falls hanging untidily
from her davits and her stern
cocked so far up that her pro-
peller and most of her rudder
showed above water.
Her people made their boats
fast alongside and came aboard
—three white men, two swarthy-
looking Eurasians and a crowd
of Chinese. The old gentleman
in the pyjamas was Captain
Treloar, the master, we learned.
The swarthy couple were the
first and second mates, and the
other two white men were
engineers. Their ship was the
Kongyun, registered in Hong
Kong and bound from Koepang
to Macassar in ballast when she
struck a submerged object—
probably an uncharted reef —
soon after midnight.
At the mention of uncharted
reefs Captain Coleridge snorted
in derision. “Same old excuse! ”
he barked.
Not the slightest trace of
sympathy for the misfortune of
a fellow-seaman, no admission
that such things as uncharted
reefs existed. He listened im-
patiently to Captain Treloar’s
description of the damage —of
how his ship had struck with her
starb’d bilge, ripping herself
open before she dragged clear.
She had heeled over so alarm-
ingly and begun to settle so
quickly that they had taken to
the boats without even waiting
to salvage their personal gear.
“You’re abandoning her?”
Coleridge asked when Treloar
requested a passage for himself
and his crew.
“What else can I do, captain?”
I felt sorry for the old fellow.
He looked so pathetically help-
less, standing there in his
crumpled pyjamas. “The coolies
refuse to go back aboard her,
and I can’t say I blame them.
You can see for yourself she’s
liable to roll right over at any
moment. I’d like to stay and see
the last of her, because she’d be
a danger to navigation if she
stayed afloat until dark.” He
smiled apologetically. “But I
suppose you’re in a hurry; you
big ships always are. If you
can’t wait until she goes per-
haps you could report her posi-
tion and drift.”
Suddenly Coleridge’s manner
underwent a complete change.
“I’ll stand by her for an hour,
captain,” he said quite amiably.
“If she’s still afloat then I’ll have
a warning sent out to all ship-
ping.” He turned to the chief-
officer. “Mr, Barton, take Cap-
tain Treloar and his officers
along to the saloon and ask the
steward to get them some break-
fast. I expect they’re feeling in
the need of something. And tell
the third mate I’d like to see
him.”
OUR third mate, a young
chap named Brian West,
was probably the only member
of our crew who refused to be
overawed by Captain Coleridge.
But, then, I could never imagine
West standing in awe of any
one. I had the impression that
he didn’t take his profession
seriously, for he was always get-
ting into trouble over something
and never in the least worried
about it. It may have been his
sleek fair hair and bright-blue
eyes, or perhaps the certain irre-
pressible boyishness about him,
but he was always getting
tangled up with girls. He came
on to the bridge, grinning easily
while he waited for the Old Man
to speak.
“Mr. West,” Coleridge said.
“I’ll thank you first to wipe that
inane grin off your face. There’s
a serious job ahead of you. I
want you to go aboard that ship
and see if anything can be done
about her. Never mind lowering
a boat. Use one of theirs, and
I’ll have the others hoisted
aboard. Take four hands with
you ; young ones who can swim.
Better take the three appren-
tices ; they’re not much use for
anything else.” He nodded to-
wards a young seaman named
Fowler —Chook we all called
him. “That damned songbird’ll
do you for a fourth. Get him
where he’ll be out of hearing for
a while. You’ll need the advice
of one of the engine-room staff,
too. Don’t waste any time, and
even if you think there’s no
hope of saving her see if you
can get one of her anchors
down.”
We pulled across the glass-
calm stretch of sea like a bunch
of school-kids setting out on a
picnic. What a thrill! What a
break from dull routine! This
was the sort of thing we’d
signed on for. I, as senior
apprentice, pulled stroke. Be-
hind me was Johnny Horton,
the youngest of us all, looking
much too small for the heavy
oar he swung. Next to him was
Ben Grant, while Chook pulled
bow oar. In the stern West sat
chatting to Butcher, the fourth
engineer.
As soon as the Old Man said
we’d need one of the engine-
room staff I knew Butch would
be coming. He was young, he
was a cheerful hard-case, and
he and West were cobbers. I
never knew what attracted those
two to each other, for Butch was
no ladies’ man. With a broken
nose sitting askew across his
ugly face he was certainly no
matinee idol.
West put the lifeboat abreast
of No. 1 hold, and he and
Butch scrambled aboard. “Keep
the boat well clear,” he ordered.
“If this tub rolls over or takes
a sudden nosedive to the bot-
tom we don’t want you sucked
down with her. Just hang around
within easy swimming distance
and pick us up if she goes.”
It was then that Butch, who
could never put three woods to-
gether without swearing, said
“God Almighty, Brian, I can’t
swim a bloody stroke!”
“Chuck up one of those life-
belts before you push off,” West
called down. He caught the belt
Chook tossed up and said “Put
this on, Butch, and you’ll be
right. This is a hell of a time
to remember you can’t swim, I
must say.”
We pulled clear and watched
the two figures scrambling awk-
wardly about the sloping decks.
After a while they let the
starb’d anchor go with a clat-
tering roar of cable that com-
pletely shattered the peace of
that perfect morning. When
they screwed up the windlass and
vanished below we rested on our
oars, discussing the chances of
salvage with lamentable lack of
knowledge of the subject. It
would be a bit of all right, we
all agreed, if the Old Man de-
cided to put us aboard as salvage
crew. But he wasn’t likely to
do that. No, if the old swine
thought the ship could be saved
he’d put Barton and some of the
older seamen aboard. Probably
take her in tow then.
OUR speculations were inter-
rupted by a hail from West
and Butch. Though they
appeared pleased with them-
selves, they wouldn’t say any-
thing as we pulled them back to
the Netherdale. We’d hear all
about it later, they said. We
did. Looking back on it now, I
realise that West’s report was
the most optimistic summing-up
of a desperate situation I am
every likely to hear. Backed up
by Butch, he stressed the good
points and glossed over the bad
ones. The ship was in ballast, he
said, empty except for No. 1
hold, which was flooded. The
bulkheads were holding, and the
amount of water in the engine-
room was negligible. Once
steam was raised the pumps
could easily cope with it. By
shifting water-ballast and per-
haps partially flooding the after-
hold the vessel could be brought
to a fairly even keel. Given
enough hands to work her, he
and Butcher felt sure they could
get her to the nearest port.
“You’ve got all I can spare,”
the Old Man snapped. “If
you’re confident the ship can be
saved, get ’em back into the
boat and cast off. I can’t hang
around here any longer.” He
jerked the engine-room telegraph
impatiently to “Stand by” and
said over his shoulder; “Just
remember, Mr. West, it’s one
thing for a bulkhead to hold in
a flat calm, but in a bit of a sea,
with the water in the hold surg-
ing against it, the strain is
increased out of all proportion.
Get that ship into port as soon
as you can.”
The Netherdale was already
gathering headway as we piled
back into the boat and cast off.
A few of our shipmates leaned
over the rail and waved fare-
well, but Coleridge didn’t even
glance down at us. Framed in
the saloon doorway we caught
a glimpse of the startled, in-
credulous face of the old
pyjama-clad captain. Apparently
it had just dawned on him that
Coleridge had pulled a swift one
on him. Without being given a
chance to change his mind he
was practically being shanghaied
while a salvage crew from the
Netherdale boarded his ship.
What did we care? At that
moment we were grateful to
Coleridge because he had chosen
us, out of more than fifty ex-
perienced men, for a difficult
salvage feat. At the time it
didn’t occur to any of us that he
hadn’t been carried away by
West’s optimism. I know now
that he thought our chances of
success slim at best, and he
picked us because we were the
ones he could best do without.
We were expendable. If we suc-
ceeded he would get a share of
the salvage money as well as a
good deal of credit for his enter-
prise. If we failed —well, the
attempt wouldn’t have cost him
anything.
We were elated, puffed up
with pride as we pulled across
to the Kongyun. She was our
ship. We weren’t thinking of
the money her salvage would
bring us, but of the honor and
glory of bringing an abandoned
ship safely into port. It was like
something out of a book.
Chook burst into song and we
apprentices joined in. The whole
glorious adventure called for
song. Chook was short and
plump, a grinning, happy-go-
lucky young larrikin who sang
no matter what he was doing.
It mattered nothing to him that
his voice was raucous and
usually off key. The jeers and
rude remarks of his shipmates
left him unmoved. Chook
wanted to sing, and sing he did.
Because of his plumpness he
looked soft, but before long we
discovered he was tougher than
any of us.
WEST’S first actions when
we scrambled aboard
proved that he hadn’t a great
deal of faith in his own report.
He insisted on Butch wearing a
lifebelt, and he kept me on deck
with him while the others went
down to the engine-room. Our
job was to put extra stores, water
and even blankets into the life-
boat. The job was difficult, for
the decks sloped so steeply that
we had to move like lop-sided
crabs, at times clutching franti-
cally at a stanchion for support.
But in spite of the inconveni-
ence I found time to examine
my new ship, and what I saw
pleased me. I missed the sure
signs of age in her thick paint-
work and seeping rust, and saw
her only as an exceedingly trim
little vessel of about fifteen
hundred tons. Because she was
designed for the tropics her
accommodation was spacious
and airy. Six state-rooms I
counted on deck —one for each
of us. What superb luxury!
When w® were satisfied that
the boat was as well equipped as
a lifeboat could be we made her
fast on a long line astern. If
the worst came we at least had
a safe line of retreat.
“Down to the stokehold and
lend a hand,” West ordered, in-
terrupting the pleasant thought
that, as senior apprentice, I
would have preference over
Chook and the other two in the
choice of state-rooms.
My first glimpse of the stoke-
hold should have dampened all
my enthusiasm. It was a dark,
evil-looking cavern lit only by
a smoking slush-lamp Butch had
suspended from a gauge high up
on the port boiler. The feeble
yellow light showed little beyond
a series of vague angles that were
all wrong. The floor seemed
quite level, yet the boilers were
completely out of alignment,
one being much higher than the
other. In the glow from an
open furnace I made out
Chook’s stocky figure leaning
crazily uphill as he stabbed at

MCGIRR'S SHIP COMES IN.
The last week of Mr. McGirr’s term as
Premier of N. S. Wales provided events
so staggering that even in the record of
the worst State Governments in Australia
it is hard to find a parallel. All pretence to
decency, fairness and constitutionalism
was thrown overboard.
When Mr. McGirr’s existence as
Premier was threatened by his
“majority,” Mr. Geraghty, of North
Sydney, an incident occurred during
which the Speaker, an active partici-
pant outside the Chamber in “Labor”
political affairs, threw out two Opposition
members, one for no obvious cause, thus
placing Mr. McGirr in control of the
House, irrespective of what Mr.
Geraghty might do. When this position
had been reached Mr. McGirr’s Attorney-
General, Mr. Clarrie Martin, raised a
point of order that Mr. Geraghty’s resolu-
tion for the adjournment was not upon
a matter of urgent public importance.
The Speaker at once supported him, but
the next day admitted that in doing so
“I had flagrantly broken Standing Order
395, and my position was untenable.”
And so it was, because the Standing
Order should be known and understood by
every neophyte in the House. Mr. Martin
— Attorney-General, now a Queen’s
Counsel, the Government’s legal adviser
and an old Parliamentary hand —surely
should have known that he was asking the
Speaker to commit a flagrant breach;
Mr. McGirr should have known it; and
so should all his Ministers. And if
the Speaker didn’t know it without re-
flection he is poorly qualified to be
Speaker. But Mr. McGirr and his fol-
lowers were perfectly prepared to take
advantage of the position, and refused to
lift a finger to enable the Opposition
afterwards to move a motion of censure
on the Speaker.
Having brushed aside all opposition in
his usual totalitarian manner in defiance
of constitutional practice and Parlia-
mentary fair play, Mr. McGirr proceeded
to shove through the House eight bills in
a few hours, most of them furtively drawn
out of the hat at the last moment.
The next that was heard of Mr. McGirr
was four days later. Safe in recess, with
Parliament not due to sit again for
months, he resigned, first fixing for him-
self a job which he has not the slightest
overt qualification to fill, and which his
condition of health in any case, if his
own statement is correct, should preclude
him from filling. He did not tell his
Cabinet colleagues what he intended to
do until the last moment. He did not
feel any inclination to bid a public fare-
well to Parliament because, true to the
tradition in which he has conducted him-
self as Premier, he lacked the courage to
seize his booty in the full light of
Parliamentary criticism. He even left the
announcement of what was planned to
his deputy, Mr. J. J. Cahill:
Mr. McGirr is going to resign for health
reasons. He is prepared to accept the
chairmanship of the Maritime Services
Board.
His Cabinet agreed instanter to treat
him to this plum, a specialist’s position
worth £2750 a year and perquisites.
That he himself apparently chose his
refuge before announcing his resignation
to the Cabinet is impudent enough. That
the Cabinet appointed him without an
instant’s delay, without considering the
needs of the job, the entitlement of the
higher-placed employees of the depart-
ment or even making a survey of its
needs constitutes a breach of trust only
less perhaps than the prior appointment
of the infirm and aged Mr. Baddeley as
Coal Controller at an age when normal
civil servants have long been turfed out.
Mr. McGirr will now occupy a post
designed to give him a nice pension.
Some more skilled deputy will do the
real work. About the only excuse that
Mr. McGirr could make for his accept-
ance of his new office is that it will
enable him to retire (with his Parlia-
mentary pension) at almost the same
salary as he enjoyed as head of the
State.
Public opinion, of course, accepted the
scandal with equanimity. Mr. McGirr
not being a racehorse, a Harold Park dog
or a nightclub proprietor, neither the
daily Press nor the public is much con-
cerned about what he does. If a jockey
were to behave on the same level of
ethics as the Cabinet has behaved this
week the greater part of the “sporting”
community would be shrieking to have
him sent out for life.
Neither is there any disturbance about
the subsequent reconstruction of the
Cabinet. It is a fitting successor to pre-
vious “Labor” Cabinets. Its leader, Mr.
J. I. Cahill, as party Whip in 1930-32
was Mr, Lang’s Parliamentary aide-de-
camp during the period of chaos which
nearly wrecked the State of N. S. Wales.
He was thrown out temporarily with his
leader at the 1932 election after having
been a party to the illegalities which
induced the Governor to withdraw Mr.
Lang’s commission. He has been dis-
tinguished for political fecundity rather
than ability, for it is his boast that since
he became a Minister in 1941 he has
introduced 50 bills, and he is the father
of the State Dockyard, the State Brick-
works and the State electricity “co-ordina-
tion” schemes which have made about five
blackouts grow where one grew before,
the results of each creation being enough
in themselves to impel an electorate which
cares what its politicians do to scrap him.
But he appeals to the A.L.P. Executive
as a steady Redfern opportunist who will
do anything he is told by the junta and
give no trouble.
The election of Mr. Heffron as Deputy
Premier is further proof that the right
road to promotion in the anti-Communist
“Labor” party just now lies through the
Communist party. Mr. Heffron’s start in
politics came as chief tutor in public-
speaking to the Communist party at a
point when he was secretary to the
Stewards and Pantrymen’s Union. Mr.
Clive Raleigh Evatt has been restored to
the Housing portfolio, and Mr. Kelly has
become Chief Secretary in his place.
There have been other minor reshuffl-
ings.
Mr. Cahill is not to be envied. He now
has to fight a by-election successfully
with Mr. McGirr’s new job hanging
round his neck and placate the restless
Mr. Geraghty, by whose favor alone he
can remain in office. And Mr. Geraghty
should be very hard to handle on his pet
subject of Council-abolition now that
Mr. Heffron is Deputy Premier. For as
far back as December 3, 1930, Mr.
Heffron said that “Now that Labor
is in power it is not going to be balked
by obstacles put in the way of the
abolition of the Legislative Council by
the Opposition. The Labor party has
definitely stated that if returned to power
the Government would definitely abolish
the Legislative Council.”
An election cannot be long delayed,
and, if the electors have a spark of right-
thinking left in them or a vestige of the
bump of self-preservation uneroded,
N.S.W. will soon see the end of the shamb-
ling mob of opportunists who have been
governing it and fattening their leaders
and friends ever since Mr. McKell rode
to power and set the pace. Lang, Mc-
Kell and McGirr should be a sufficient
helping of the kind of leadership “Labor”
produces in N. S. Wales for any self-
respecting and prudent State. Mr. Mc-
Girr, like Mr. McKell, however, has
come safe into harbor.
The World Around Us.
writer of the following article is an
Australian engaged in the construction
industry who recently returned from a
long business trip overseas .]
_ . . , . ...
THAT We Australians have a Splendid
country is beyond question, and because
nature has been kind we excel in some
pursuits such as the growing of wool,
production in an emergency of the
world’s finest soldiers, and also astonish-
ing sportsmen and sportswomen if viewed
on a population basis,
These performances have given us our
place in the world, but are not sufficient
if our planning and thinking for the
future remain at their present level. Ten
or more years ago we could, with justice,
boast of the best living conditions in the
world; but in the interim those of some
other countries have advanced and ours
have not even been maintained,
We are so very complacent and self-
satisfied. Our political leaders make
little attempt to keep us abreast of ideas
and methods found to be good in other
countries and suitable for introduction
here to improve our standards of life. In
all, I recently visited 14 countries and
made some study of their industries, and
found that all, in a general way, viewed
good honest work as a necessary service
to their fellow-worker and not a boring
necessity to obtain a livelihood. This
must be known to our politicians, for
most have travelled; but they remain
silent.
There is no doubt the standard of liv-
ing for a working family in the United
States is the best in the world and much
in advance of our living conditions. In-
dustry generally works a 40-hour week,
and although the unions are not so strong
as in Australia, some plants, such as the
Ford Motor Company, employ only
unionists.
United States union officials are astute
businessmen who do not, as here, see one
side of the picture only. They ascertain
the capital and annual profit of the com-
panies staffed by their members, and
their approach for higher wages takes the
form of “you give us an increase and we
will contract to look after you.” The
managements can accept their word, and
come to know that to grant an in-
crease will mean greater production and
so added profit. The average worker has
become educated to believe that this
greater production will benefit his living
standards, and, if acceptance of this
principle is general, it will give his wife
and family a better standard of service
and living. It is accepted that work is
necessary, and if all pull their weight all
will benefit.
If a new idea or piece of equipment is
suggested the reply from the unionist is
not, as in Australia, “What is he getting
out of it?” The reply instead is “What
am I to get out of it?” The result in Aus-
tralia very often is that the idea is killed ;
in the U.S. just as often the idea is
adopted, and the workman gets additional
pay and the community some benefit.
This is just one of the reasons why the
average workman in a factory in the U.S.
goes to work in a better motor-car than
most employers do in Australia.
Because of mechanical aids the
American workman does not toil
harder than his opposite-number in Aus-
tralia, but his direction and approach are
more intelligent, and therefore output per
man-hour is better. For that reason the
purchasing-power of his wages is much
greater than ours.
As an illustration, in the United States
the standard wage-rate for building-
tradesmen averages three dollars an hour
for a 40-hour week. Their opposite-num-
bers in Australia receive 7s. 6d. an hour,
award rates. What, then, can be bought
for three dollars compared with 7s. 6d,
in Sydney? A well-known proprietary
brand of men’s shirts costs 3j dollars in
the U.S.; the same brand and quality
costs 425, in Sydney. If we apply the
formula, that shirt should cost about
8s 3d. in Sydney. U.S. Palm Beach suits
cost 30 to 60 dollars, equalling 10 to 20
hours of labor cost. Can we buy a suit
of clothes for £3 15s. or a good suit for
£7 10s.?
Housing costs nine to 16 dollars
per square foot. Can we buy a house
for £ll2 10s. per square, or a really good
home for £2OO a square? Best steak costs
\\ dollars a pound. Can we get the best
steak for 3s. a pound? The best
cinema seats cost 90 cents in Los
Angeles, which means that the Australian
should not pay more than 2s. 3d. for the
best seat in our city picture theatres. At
one dollar for a haircut the cost in Sydney
should be 2s. 6d. If we carry these com-
parisons to motor-cars, petrol, cigarettes,
basic foods or air-travel, the answers
are even more convincing that the work-
man in the United States enjoys a better
standard of living than our man does.
Many items of labor-saving and
materials-handling equipment are stan-
dard practice in U.S., England, France
and Germany, and all assist the produc-
tion output of building operatives. Under
the State laws of N.S.W. all these must be
approved by the Department of Scaffold-
ing and Lifts before it is lawful to use
them. My interview with this department
was very unsatisfactory. Under our laws
not one of these labor-saving devices
came up to the safety requirements. In
some the modifications asked for would
render the equipment almost useless, and
this because this department has set
standards of safety more rigid than any
country in the world. I have difficulty
believing all these other countries are
wrong and we are right, but I do know
that many man-hours are wasted because
of requirements not thought necessary in
Great Britain and elsewhere.
In N. S. Wales we recently experienced
bitter trade-union opposition over the
proposed introduction of the one-man
bus. As is well known, the Minister for
Transport eventually got his way (after
a strike or two), and these one-man
buses are now in operation and appear
to be successful. There is nothing new
in this idea ; one-man buses are operat-
ing successfully in cities elsewhere varying
in population from 2,000,000 down to
300.000 people.
And car-parking? All must remember
the controversy a few years ago over the
suggestion to construct a car-park under
Hyde Park. The proposal was killed, and
parking difficulties in Sydney grow
greater each year. But the Union Square
parking-station in San Francisco is built
under a city park with gardens, lawns and
statues over its roof, little above the
adjoining pavements. This parking-
station accommodates 1700 motor-cars
plus reception and service areas, and the
cars it accommodates would require 125
city blocks to park, using Australian
methods. It is as centrally placed as
Hyde Park is in Sydney, and, although
owned by private enterprise, it returns
28.000 dollars a year to the San Francisco
City Council. At present Los Angeles is
constructing a similar park under
Pershing Square.
It is futile to say that we can’t do these
things because of lack of population ; San
Francisco has 700,000 people and Los
Angeles 2,000,000. The reason for our
slipping behind the more progressive
countries of the world is that we have too
many parochial people who find difficul-
ties in doing things and far too few with
vision and determination to develop their
ideas. In other words, our thinking is
narrow and faulty. If we are to hold
this country our outlook will have to
undergo a vast change.
H. BRUCE GIBSON.
Vintage Season.
Over a thousand tons of grapes a day
have been pouring into South Australian
wineries and packing-houses recently as
a result of the bumper harvest in the
Upper Murray area. Loaded trucks and
trailers have waited in two-hour punt-
queues to cross the Murray, bound for
wineries between the Barossa Valley and
Adelaide. Four hundred tons of grapes
a day are being unloaded into Barossa
Valley wineries alone. Winemakers in
these areas are now paying £24 a ton —
£4 a ton more than last year.
But, at almost the same time,
the future of the world-famous
Hunter River (N.S.W.) wine-producing
area is reviewed with some concern by
the State Government Viticulturist, Mr.
H. L. Manuel, in the latest report of the
Federal Viticultural Council of Australia.
The Hunter River wine district, pro-
ducing fine table wines which rank,
according to connoisseurs, with the
world’s best, is regarded by the Australian
wine industry as a national asset of great
prestige value.
“Wines of the Lilydale district of Vic-
toria are now memories of the past,” the
report states, “and so it may be with the
wines of the Hunter before the 20th
century ends.”
Mr. Manuel explains that, despite satis-
factorily dry conditions this year, the
vines of the Hunter have not recovered
fully from the outbreak of downy mildew
disease brought on by the heavy floods
of preceding years.
Leading winegrowers on the other
hand are more optimistic—both in their
immediate and long-range outlook —and
expect some increase in gallonage on last
year, the second-worst season in the
district’s history. Mr. Manuel and the
winegrowers agree that this year’s vintage
in the Hunter River district will be of a
particularly high quality.
In his report Mr. Manuel points to a
continuing and gradual decline in
Hunter wine production, and to the fact
that available suitable land for wine-
growing in the area is extremely limited.
To replace the ordinary label with its
scant details of wine-type and brand-
name, an imaginative new “two-label
device is being introduced by a Sydney
wine firm: one label on the front states
the producer’s name, the type of grapes
used and the wine area concerned; the
wine-map on the back is a simple refer-
ence to Australia’s winegrowing areas.
During the last few years Australians
have expressed a growing eagerness to
learn more about their own country s
wines and the places in which they art
grown —and, in many cases, have bee
grown for over 100 years.
It is intended that these new Australian
wine labels will help to encourage tnai
unpretentious knowledge of wines, an _
the simple respect for them, both i
essential in any civilised and maiu
wine-drinking community.


PLAIN ENGLISH
An Appropriate Show.
Sydney’s Royal Show, now functioning
at the old address, could scarcely have
been staged at a more appropriate time.
For the first occasion in many years the
great Sydney population has been
brought back with a shock to the eternal
truth that cities cannot live without the
products of the soil.
Possibly a million people will pass
through the showground turnstiles during
the 10 days and nine nights of the ex-
hibition. Most of them will go with a
new awareness of what the prize stock,
the displays of grain and fruit, vegetables
and honey, bacon, cheese, butter, eggs
and the rest of it mean to them.
To minds feeling the day-by-day im-
pact of rising food prices, of expressed
doubts about Australia’s ability to feed
itself in the future, of organised farmers
almost browbeating the Federal Govern-
ment on taxes and prices, of failing ex-
port markets, and of the ever-present
difficulty of the housewife in not only
finding food but also paying for it, a
visit to the show should do several things.
It should make it clear that behind all
the noise, political and otherwise, about
the farmer he is not only still there but
still doing his bit as far as is possible.
Champion beef-bulls and aristocratic
dairy-cows may seem aloof from the
local butchery and the milkman, but there
is a direct connection with them, and
without the champions the quality and
quantity of the meat- and milk-supplies
would be worse than they are.
The show is, above all, a farm show.
True, it is mainly a carnival for most of
those who attend it —partly educational
and partly frivolous —but it says some-
thing for the show that though to
ordinary people it has a quality of same-
ness with previous shows, they love it
and go back to it as frequently as they
can.
This year the land products on display
will arouse many questions as to why, for
instance, one cannot buy in the shops
such gorgeous fruits or prime cuts of
bacon or rich preserves. Well, it is good
for people to question. It is certain that
if the Australian people, particularly
those who live in cities, don’t begin ask-
ing pertinent questions pretty soon they’ll
eat a lot less and pay more for it.
New Chief Justice.
Sir Owen Dixon, succeeding Sir John
Latham as Chief Justice of the High
Court, will be the only incumbent of the
office except Sir Frank Gavan Duffy who
has not risen some part of the way to
eminence through politics.
All other Chief Justices —Sir Samuel
Griffith, Sir Edmund Barton, Sir Isaac
Isaacs, Sir John Latham —were distin-
guished as political leaders rather than as
lawyers before their elevations to the
Bench, though none doubted their quality
as jurists.
There was some rumor, very strongly
canvassed a few months ago, that Mr.
Menzies might fill the vacancy ; but if
he had any thoughts trending that way
he is to be congratulated on making a
breach with the habit of appointing
to the office a counsel with political ex-
perience.
In the existing political atmosphere
and the increasing tendency of the
“Labor” party to regard the courts,
traditionally divorced from politics, as
part of the party machinery, from
which any “Labor” Government of the
day is entitled to have slavish support,
it becomes more and more necessary that
appointments should be entirely free
from the faintest suspicion of party con-
nection or bias.
Sir John Latham, during his long term
of office, the most important period prob-
ably in the history of the court in the
light of the great changes in constitutional
law which have taken place as the result
of the coming into force of the Statute
of Westminster and the impact of the
amendments to the Constitution creating
the Loan Council, has established a fine
reputation for impartiality and indepen-
dence of thought and has done much to
increase the prestige of the court.
Sir Owen Dixon has had a career
almost unexampled. He was called to
the Victorian Bar in 1910, was marked
for high distinction from almost his first
appearance in court, was a King’s
Counsel at 36, an acting-judge of the
Victorian Supreme Court at 40 and a
justice of the High Court at 42. More
than any other judge or member of the
Bar he can claim to have been intimately
connected with the development of the
court and its present outlook and nature.
During the war he was, however,
detached from his judicial functions first
to take over the chairmanship of the
Central Wool Committee and next by
the Curtin Government in 1943 to act as
Ambassador to Washington. His
report as a mediator in the Kashmir
dispute in 1950 enhanced his reputation.
Education a Stalking-horse.
Sydney Town Hall was the scene last
Friday night of what was described in
advertisements sponsored by the N. S.
Wales Teachers’ Federation as a “mass
meeting of citizens in defence of educa-
tion.” The Federation had placed large
advertisements in the daily papers and
had also used the extremely doubtful
practice of getting teachers to hand out
circulars for pupils to take home to their
parents.
And if the practice was doubtful there
was no doubt at all about the contents
of the circulars; they were frankly
partisan and were directed against the
Federal Government. They gave promin-
ence to a lurid extract from a statement
made by Education Minister Heffron as
part of the N. S. Wales “Labor” Govern-
ment’s attempt to thrust on to the
shoulders of Menzies and Fadden the
burden of responsibility for its own in-
ability to put its house in order.
Is is not the first time schoolchildren
have been used by the Federation for the
dissemination of its propaganda. Last
year kiddies were sent home with cir-
culars urging the teachers’ claims for
increased salaries. No mention was made
of salaries on this occasion, but a few
days earlier at another Town Hall meet-
ing, at which the Friday-night show was
decided upon, reference was made to
Government plans for school-expansion
and it was commented that “salaries and
allowances would have to be big enough
to induce the necessary enrolment” of
additional teachers.
Scare-talk of the Heffron brand was
also used to induce support from Parents
and Citizens’ Associations and Mothers’
Clubs —worthy bodies whose chief in-
terests are in the welfare of their children.
The majority of the people at the Town
Hall meeting were probably genuinely
convinced, after listening to the speeches
loosed upon them, that the Federal Gov-
ernment had viciously cut the amount of
loan-money available for education,
though there must surely have been some-
one on the platform sufficiently familiar
with the facts to have told them that
N. S. Wales received £64 million in loan
funds this year—an increase of 60 p.c.
on last year—and that it was purely a
matter for the State Government to
decide how much of this should be
allotted to education. No one troubled
to tell the audience that; it might have
interfered with the passing of resolutions
which had been readied up at the previous
meeting and the substance of which had
been printed in the Communist “Tribune”
several times in the previous few months.
These resolutions urged the Federal Gov-
ernment to provide £lOO million from
loan funds for school buildings and other
capital expenditure in the States, and £2O
million for current expenditure—both
sums to be additional to allocations from
general loan funds and annual grants to
the States.
The very ease with which these people
throw around imaginary millions without
any pretence of having carefully estimated
actual needs and without any suggestion
how a loan of such dimensions could be
raised in the present state of the loan
market, or, in the unlikely event of its
being raised, where the labor and
materials necessary to convert it into
buildings and equipment are to come
from, shows the insincerity of those be-
hind the stunt. It is the outcome of an
alliance between two political groups—
one desirous on behalf of the A.L.P. to
embarrass and discredit the Menzies
Government, and the other, Communist-
inspired, eager to stir up resentment
against “preparations for war”—in other
words, against the spending of money for
the defence of Australia. Innocent
persons who lent their names and sup-
port to the meeting were merely being
used as dupes by political schemers.
Defence and Luxuries.
Unobtrusively amid all the clamor
about the needs of State Governments —
the Communist-run Teachers’ Federation
in N. S. Wales estimates that Mr.
Heffron’s Budget for making the educa-
tion services in N. S. Wales satisfactory
calls for £70,000,000 on present cost
figures—the Commonwealth announced
that it had placed defence orders during
the week for £13,000,000-worth of
materials and plant.
Over £5,000,000 has been laid out for
radar, electronic and optical instruments,
£1,250,000 to start a new jet-aircraft
factory in Mr. Playford’s State, and
£7,500,000 on the R.A.N. for modernisa-
tion of existing ships, including the re-
construction of H.M.A.S. Hobart, the
conversion of five small ships to anti-
submarine services, the building of four
Daring-class destroyers—the most power-
ful destroyers in the British Navies —and
new barracks at Manus and elsewhere.
Meanwhile, though Mr. Eden says that
Allied strength has put war further
away in Europe, the hard-pressed United
Kingdom, as the Chief of the Imperial
General Staff told the United States a
few days ago, is providing the bulk of
General Eisenhower’s armored force in
Europe, 10 regular divisions all told, the
second-largest fleet in the world and the
largest air force in Europe, and keeping
garrisons or fighting forces in 18 centres
abroad while rebuilding an economy,
stripped to the bone by the last war,
on what would here be called a national
starvation ration.
Apart from this it is providing the bulk
of the shipping which makes it possible
for this country to continue to trade.
Yet “Labor,” led by educated men of
the Evatt stamp, continues to exist in
a world of its own, dreaming dreams
in tens of millions for non-essentials,
squandering time in strikes, handicapping
the defence and recovery effort at every
turn by refusing to co-operate with Gov-
ernments which are not “Labor” Govern-
ments and generally implementing its
“democratic” dictum that, though the
people of Australia have the right to
elect their own leaders, they must not
elect any leaders who are not under the
domination of “Labor’s” controlling
junta. '
Egg-and-Leftuce and
Butcher's-Apron.
About the height of absurdity has been
reached in the specifications for medals
and badges which are issued or to be
issued to servicemen taking part in the
Korean war.
There are already two medals—
the Korean Service Medal and the United
Nations Medal, the one with a yellow-
and-green ribbon and awarded as an
Army Command decoration, and the
other with a ribbon which carries a series
of narrow perpendicular blue-and-white
stripes. These emblems of heroism are
known to the troops as the “egg-and-
lettuce” and the “butcher’s-apron,” but
no butchery is needed to earn either of
them.
They are awarded like returned-
soldier badges. All that is required
is that the aspirant shall have “served
one day on the posted strength of a unit
or formation on land in Korea since July,
1950, made one operational sortie over
the area or spent 28 days’ service afloat
in Korean waters.”
He need not have been within 200
miles of the front. He need not have
been engaged on active-service duties.
Indeed, he need never have heard a shot
fired or carried a rifle. Any soldier sent
from Tokyo by aircraft to carry a mail-
bag to Pusan, 200 miles from the fighting
line, running no risk of attack, spending
the night there and returning to Japan,
may find himself decorated with a couple
of medals and a returned-soldier’s badge.
The nine members of the editors’ dele-
gation which visited Tokyo in December-
January and were away altogether a fort-
night from the Commonwealth are all
presumably qualified to sport these
baubles, having been attached to a for-
mation and given an Army number and
issued with paybooks and spent a day
or so in Korea, just as much as the gal-
lant fellows who fought—and many who
died —in the battles of Anzac Day last
year and in the fight of last October.
The whole thing is a roaring farce.
If the Americans and the bauble-happy
inhabitants of El Salvador and Liberia
who gambol in the United Nations
Assembly wish to do this sort of thing
they are welcome to it, but Australia,
with its A.I.F. tradition and its meticulous
regulations for the admission of mem-
bers to the R.S.L., should set a higher
standard.
It is outrageous that any mere fleeting
visitor should be placed on the same
basis of recognition as men who have seen
months of grim fighting.
Perjury—Plain and Fancy.
With the N. S. Wales Royal Commission
on Liquor in its sixth month, and with
the evidence already running into
sufficient wordage to fill half-a-dozen
Gone With the Winds } two or three facts
seem to thrust themselves through the
undergrowth of verbiage.
In the early stages the most notable
feature was the generosity and trustful-
ness of persons who lent money to
licensees without worrying about bind-
ing documents and in some cases with-
out troubling to collect interest or
repayments. Then there was the almost
unanimous anonymity of bottled-beer
suppliers—folk like George and Peter,
whose surnames were unknown to any
of the many witnesses who claimed to
have had dealings with them.
Another interesting sidelight was that
not only George and Peter, but almost
everyone connected with the transfer of
ownership in bottled beer, seemed to have
an old-fashioned prejudice against giving
or receiving cheques. Rolls of notes
were the universal currency when bottled
brew changed owners. There seemed,
too, to be a spirit of jolly camaraderie
between the beer-merchants and the
smiling fellows who ran the night-clubs.
Despite the fact that these joints were
mostly without any kind of liquor-licence
and admitted selling beer at ss. and 6s.
a bottle, it didn’t occur to the suppliers
to ask more than the fixed price, 2s. 4|d.
a bottle. That, according to the evidence
presented to the commission, was the pic-
ture up until about 10 or 12 days ago.
Then a couple of witnesses broke the
sequence of corroboration by swearing
they had been charged up to 3s. 4d. a
bottle for beer supplied by Walter Cavill
Pty., Ltd., whose directors had previously
testified that they had never charged over
the fixed price. When these witnesses left
the box the air of jollity seemed to
vanish, and the next few days produced
more admissions of perjury than had been
heard in any court since the Moscow
treason trials.
Walter Cavill, managing-director of
Cavills, was recalled and admitted that
the evidence he had previously given in
regard to prices was false. He had
charged excess prices to nine clubs and
restaurants. He had given his previous
evidence because he did not want to let
down clients who had already given
similar evidence. He felt he was pro-
tecting them and himself. The excess
money had been banked in his private
account. There was no record in his
books. He denied that he and Bingham,
a fellow-director, had agreed to commit
perjury:
Mr. Dovey: You say the policy of your
firm is perjury?—No. Well, what is it? —
In the discussion with Mr. Bingham we said
we should protect these people.
Mr. Justice Maxwell: In order to do
that I understand you would come along
here and swear the price was 28s. 6d. a
dozen?
Cavill; That is so.
Mr. Justice Maxwell : What else is
that but plain and simple perjury?—A false
statement.
Mr. Justice Maxwell: Well, it is false.
It happens to he relevant to the matters I
have to investigate. That makes it perjury.
Make it a false statement if you like. —It is
a serious matter, I realise.
Mr. Justice Maxwell ; And it is perjury.
Charles Edward Bingham also admitted
that previous evidence given by him had
been false, to bis knowledge and inten-
tion. Asked why he had given false
evidence, he said:
I felt at the time that it would be the
best thing to do. It would let down those
people who had given evidence before. It
would be contrary to their evidence.
Ernest Alexander Ireland, of the River-
side Cafe, another early adherent of the
fixed-price story, also amended his evid-
ence and admitted that he had been
charged excess prices by both Cavills and
the House of Hayes. He had lied so as
“not to let the others down.” Bingham
had asked him not to let Cavills down,
and Wade, manager of the House of
Hayes, had asked him to say he had paid
the right price.
Russell Oscar Day (an associate of
Sammy Lee, or Levi, in Lee Enterprises,
which conducted the Sammy Lee Club)
said he didn’t know whether he was still a
J.P. because he “had had no communica-
tion from the Department of Justice.”
He admitted having lied about quantities
and prices of bottled beer. He had lied
because Lee had lied: —-
Mr. Justice Maxwell: So you and he
conspired criminally conspired —to tell
some untrue story on oath. That is what
it amounts to?
Day: I suppose so.
His Honor: You suppose so. Have you
any doubt about it?
Day did not reply.
Another self-confessed perjurer was
Samuel Francis Babbici, who said he had
made up his mind to tell the truth after
he had read Cavill’s evidence. He had
offered some resistance to Bingham’s sug-
gestion that he should make a false
statement, but
when you are told everyone else is solid
and one weak link would blow the business
to pieces, well, I didn’t take the oath as
seriously as I otherwise would.
Arthur Thomas Baldwin’s perjury was
committed, so he said, in the Licensing
Court when he swore that £5OOO was the
figure he had paid for a grocery-business
and wine-and-spirit licence at Collaroy.
He had actually paid another £2OOO,
which was not disclosed.
Queerest piece of perjury of the lot was
that of Richard Joseph Valentine, who
was sure he had committed perjury, but
o Continued on next page.}


wasn’t sure when. On Wednesday he
seemed sure that his previous right-price
evidence had been wrong and that he had
been charged blackmarket prices by both
Cavill’s and Hayes. The following day
he denied his Wednesday evidence, saying
he had been confused when he gave it.
He now swore that he had never been
overcharged by the House of Hayes. To
Mr. Dovey he admitted that after the pre-
vious day’s hearing he had approached
Mr. Dovey and spoken of fears of getting
“bashed” as a result of his evidence. He
now said the fears were the result of his
feeling confused. He had phoned Wade
on Wednesday night and had seen Wade’s
counsel, who “would have nothing to do
with him.” He denied that he had re-
ceived any money or promise of money.
Mr. Justice Maxwell said of Valentines
third story;
I believe the Valentine evidence of yester-
day. I don't believe the Valentine of today.
That is a finding of fact nothing can
shatter.
When Wade said that Valentine “told
a lot of lies yesterday,” his Honor com-
mented “I believe him and not you.
The long story is still in process oi
being unfolded.
POLITICAL POINTS
How did the old song go?—“Oh, lucky
Jim! How I envy him!”
The reshuffle in the N. S. Wales
Cabinet after Cahill took over from Mc-
Grrrrr didn’t amount to much more than
flipping the pack. The new Premier
added the Treasury to his Local Govern-
ment portfolio and passed Public Works
over to Renshaw, whose Lands job went
to F. H. Hawkins, previously Minister
without portfolio, a distinction now
accorded A. G. Enticknap. Renshaw will
also assist the Premier in Local Govern-
ment. Main interest was in who would
get Clive Evatt’s Chief-Secretaryship—
since someone always seems to get Clive’s
job when there is a change of Premiers.
It went to Health Minister Gus Kelly in
exchange for Housing, which he inherited
from Clive at the last shuffle.
It’ll be just like old times for Evatt
minor to be back among the foundation-
stones again, but judging by eyewitness
reports of the changing of the card he
was even more annoyed over getting the
job back than he was of losing it. One
thing about his return to the Housing
Ministry—no one can say it was the
result of a Gallop poll.
At the time of the alleged Finnan-
Enticknap scuffle a fortnight ago the
“Daily Telegraph” published a photo-
graph of the principals—both usually
bespectacled—without glasses. Last
Thursday the “Telly” ran a picture of
Finnan congratulating Enticknap on his
election to Cabinet. Both pairs of specs,
were well in position.
Rugby Union, through its N.S.W.
treasurer, got one of the very few favor-
able mentions so far heard at the liquor
inquiry.
The Victorian Country party’s threat
of a break with the Federal C.P. turned
out to be no more than a threat, though
possibly there are some in Canberra who
wish it had been a promise—and had
been fulfilled. When Commerce Minister
McEwen rose to address the annual con-
ference he had to face a barrage of jeers.
These had apparently been prepared for
S’Artie Fadden, but, the Treasurer being
absent, McEwen copped the lot. As the
conference proceeded it became clear
that the majority of delegates wanted to
let off steam rather than actually blow
their top, and most of them were relieved
when an innocuous resolution was passed
urging the party “to re-examine its con-
stitution to bring it into closer touch with
branches.” McEwen supported the
motion; it was carried almost unani-
mously and everyone was happy—or at
least relieved.
Meantime Half-Premier McDonald
intends to push on with his High Court
challenge on uniform taxation, which he
claims is “robbing” Victoria of
£20,500,000 a year. If he wins it there’ll
be a mighty lot of sorting-out of financial
plans, but McD. may not be as happy
as he hopes. With taxing-power in his
own hands he would no longer be able
to pass the buck and lay the blame on
Bob. Nor would the Sydney whingers.
At the N.S.W. liquor inquiry a witness
who admitted perjury was explaining—as
did several others—that he had done it so
as not to let other witnesses down. Be-
coming colloquial, he said, “If we had
put them in” Maxwell, J., interrupted
him with “That’s an ominous phrase.”
Wool-values at the Brisbane sales last
week were roughly half what they were
this time last year. One result is a move
by graziers to ask the Queensland Indus-
trial Court for a reduction in shearing
wages. The A.W.U.’s reaction will be
significant as illustrating union attitude.
The union sought and got high wages on
the strength of high wool-prices. With
those prices down heavily, will it accept
reduced wages?
Another hurdle has arisen for the
Olympic athletes. One result of the
decision to make the Carlton Oval the
site for the Games in Melbourne was a
sudden desire of almost everybody to
become a member of the Carlton C.C.
The club has been swamped with applica-
tions, and Lud Mayor Nilsen has got up
on his hind-legs and demanded an Act
of Parliament to prohibit new members
from getting free admittance to the
Games. If he doesn’t get it he is going
to ask the City Council to rescind its
decision to provide its share, £200,000, to
the cost of staging the Games at Carlton.
Lang’s “Century,” rapidly developing
into a boost-organ for Evatt, has worked
it out that on the Lyne figures an election
at the present time would lose the Gov-
ernment 33 seats and give “Labor” a
majority of 47. The Doc. had better not
take the forecast too seriously. It is
arrived at by the following line of reason-
ing : The Government dropped about
6500 votes in Lyne, therefore if a general
election had been held the same day it
would have lost every seat in which its
majority at the last election was less than
6500. The reasoning overlooks several
things: “Labor” turned on a blitz in the
Lyne electorate, using all its big guns;
the Libs left the job entirely to the C.P.;
electors were aware that the fate of the
Government was not involved in an
adverse vote; Government credit policy
had had no time to prove itself and over-
come initial opposition. In other words,
the figures gave the line on Lyne, but on
little else.
Bathurst (N.S.W.) council, urging that
the Federal Government should grant
“interest-free credit” to local-government
bodies, adds that “to save our civilisation
from bankruptcy, a change in the present
moth-eaten monetary system is impera-
tive.” The council overlooks the fact that
few of us retain anything monetary long
enough for the moths to get at it.

some politicians in the future. Suppose
Kiama decides the time has come to
rename its Blowhole!
Wasn’t there a best-seller not so long
ago called “What Made Sammy Run?”
B. J. Maguire, formerly Queensland’s
Chief Electoral Officer and now Registrar
of Building Societies, was guest-of-honor
in Brisbane last week at a gathering of
“sporting and professional men and other
friends and well-wishers,” the purpose of
the function being to present him with a
cheque for £l5OO towards legal expenses
incurred in his trials last year on a charge
of having forged an absent vote in the
Bulimba election. He was tried three
times ; each time the jury disagreed, and
after the third trial the Crown decided
not to proceed any further. Maguire’s
total expenses were said to be somewhere
around £3OOO, and, in presenting the
£l5OO, the chairman of his well-wisher
committee, Mr. J. Riordan, told him to
regard it as an interim payment.
Port Pirie, Port Augusta and Whyalla
are wondering which of them Premier
Playford had in mind when he said, after
he got home from his talks with the
Prime Minister on uranium plans :
If I were to make a prediction on the
location of the first atomic-energy pile in
the Southern Hemisphere, I would name
without any hesitation the shores of Spencer
Gulf.
Port Pirie, which smelts the silver-lead
ore from Broken Hill, has already been
named as the site of the plant which will
treat uranium-ores from Radium Hill,
described by American expert Jesse
Johnson as “ready to become a significant
producer of commercial grade uranium-
ore.”
Almost everybody seems to have been
rewarded for distinguished service in the
last week of the N. S. Wales Parliament.
McGrrrrr got a big job for life, Evatt
minor got his foundation-stones back,
Enticknap, who was supposed to have led
a charge against the menacing bulk of
Finnan, the Minister for Industry, was
decorated with the portfolio of an assist-
ant Minister, Clarrie Martin, whose
glaringly erroneous advice led Speaker
Lamb into a glaring breach of Standing
Orders, was made a Q.C., and the Com-
munists have hung a large railway-strike
round the neck of Cahill, the new Premier,
who, like Chifley, was sacked for his
part in the railway strike of 1917 which
disrupted the war-time economy of the
State at the behest of the Gardens, Den-
fords and other wobblies and Leftists of
the period. However, no fountain of
honor seems to have gushed over
Geraghty.
As was expected, Queensland “Labor”
retained the Ithaca seat in the State
Assembly, left vacant by the death of the
late Premier Hanlon. New member is
L. Eastment, Hanlon’s former campaign
director, whose majority—24l7 before
counting postal and absentee votes —is
slightly higher than the “Labor” majority
at the 1950 election.
Some unkind words were spoken by
Jack Lang at the annual conference of
his Australian Labor Party (Non-Com-
munist) —still held by the faithful to be
the only true Australian Labor party.
Lang attacked the Ferguson junta for
not carrying out “Labor’s” policy of
abolishing the Legislative Council. The
Big Fella said that “Labor” M.L.Cs.,
who had been put into the Council to
do away with it, were instead “fighting
like hard-boiled reactionaries in defence
of their vested interests in their jobs.”
The executive of the A.L.P. had estab-
lished a new caste system, and member-
ship of the executive was “the Open
Sesame to perquisites.” When he gets
down to analysing the inner working of
“Labor,” past and present, Jack usually
knows what he’s talking about.
Reported in sundry newspapers that
detectives in Queensland had “issued a
strike ultimatum” to the Government over
the demotion of two of their number. In
1923 there was a police “strike” in Mel-
bourne, with wild riots, death, injuries
and looting and damage. It wasn’t a
strike but a mutiny, as is any refusal of
duty by one who has taken the kind of
oath policemen take.
H. V. Stirling, a wheatgrowers’
“spokesman,” has announced that
“primary producers would take strong
exception to any suggestion that they
would have to be bribed before they
would help to arrest the serious decline
in food-production.” Let’s see —the
wheatgrowers’ “spokesmen” demanded
tax-concessions and higher wheat-prices
from the Commnowealth before farmers
would sow more wheat. Perhaps that
isn’t what Stirling means; but what is he
talking about?
McGrrrrr’s —now Cahill’s —dilapidated
railways showed a loss of £6,417,431 last
year, the expenses being £2,400,000 more
and the revenue £1,000,000 less than the
estimate. Trams and buses lost £1,560,000.
But the McG. did not pick the director-
ship of these activities, whose needs cry
out for a genius, when he selected his
job on resigning the Premiership. He
picked a department which has con-
sistently shown a surplus—it can’t help
it—since 1922, last year’s being abnormal
at £271,000, because “earnings exceeded
the estimates of £248,000.” The responsi-
bility for bankrupt undertakings he and
his spoils-grabbers are prepared to leave
to civil servants.
Victorian State Electricity Commission
is short of current owing to a strike of
maintenance-workers, but it had enough
power to shock the community with a
20 p.c. electricity rise—which raised a
yell from the unions. Chairman Hunt
said that the tariff had to rise to meet
increased wages and costs, otherwise by
next financial reckoning the commission
would be under the weather to the extent
of £3,000,000.
There’s likely to be a rush by Sydney
housewives dependent upon electric-
stoves when they hear of the solar cooker.
This is a stove, designed by Indian
scientists, to use the sun’s heat for cook-
ing, and, according to New Delhi reports,
it works, Pandit Nehru having installed
one. Still, before people start ordering
the things they want to be sure
Cahill’s Electricity Authority doesn’t
clap controls over the sun’s rays so as
to equalise the blackouts.
Murray Valley Development League
isn’t being fobbed off by the Sydney and
Melbourne Governments on its demands
for proper inquiries into the causes of the
bushfires which caused death and heavy
farm losses in south-east Riverina in
February-March. The Sydney Govern-
ment hasn’t answered the charge of Fair-
baim, M.H.R., that one big fire was
caused by negligence of the N.S.W.
railways.
According to the Australian Decentra-
lisation and New States movement:
The effective government and the more
rapid development of many parts of Aus-
tralia will be assured only to the extent
that powers of self-determination are
extended to various regions as they reach
a stage of maturity. It is against the tide
of history and in favor of the tide of
dictatorship to oppose this development.
The Decentralisation and New States
Movement feels that the realisation of the
basic truths by people in the cities is a first
essential step to a closer understanding and
intelligent approach to the problems in-
volved.
“A first essential to a closer understand-
ing” would be to avoid this sort of
jargon.
New Zealand, like Australia, is
tightening control on capital issues and
restricting imports. Is Holland wrong
as well as Menzies?
“Eco”: “Labor” spokesmen, ( and
others with sectional axes to grind, have
denounced the Federal Government’s
credit-restriction policy as having severely
limited opportunity for those who need
bank accommodation. The lie has been
given them by the Commonwealth
Bureau of Statistics, which has revealed
that bank overdrafts reached a new
record in February. Advances by the
private banks in that month were £654
million, an increase of nearly £l6 million
on the previous month, and £159 million
more than in February, 1951. Deposits
during February averaged £1228 million,
an increase of but £lO million over the
month, and only £3O million over the
year. The ratio of advances to deposits
in February, 52.4 per cent., was the
highest since the war.

A DAY AT THE SHOW.


Society
“Jasby”: Ever seen a horse at anchor?
I saw one last week in Sydney’s Bent-
street. Harnessed to a trolley and with
its head buried in a nosebag, it had one
end of a mooring-rope around its neck.
The other end was tied to a 361 b. weight
sitting comfortably on the footpath. On
my next visit to Broken Hill I’m going
to keep a sharp lookout for a Manly
ferry tied up to the veranda-posts of the

“Clooter”: When I read in a Sydney
paper that two N.S.W. politicians had
swapped high words and a punch or two,
and the next day emphatic denials by
the alleged belligerents, it reminded me
of what happened in our town a few
years back. Two eminent businessmen,
both church dignitaries, were said to have
indulged in the same sort of antics. This
was denied as emphatically as in the case
of the politicians. However, seeking me
out as a confidant, one of the parties said
he intended to fight the other at a secret
place and asked me to provide a set of
6oz. boxing-gloves, to act as referee and
swear-in a mutual friend as timekeeper.
This was duly done, the two gladiators,
"W ho pinched my surf-board?”
myself and my friend being sworn to the
darkest secrecy. The venue was a small
space in some bushes, over a river from
the town, accessible only by a swaying
single-passenger suspension bridge; the
time was 6 a.m. on a summer morn. So
well was the secret kept that the hospital-
secretary, a born opportunist, managed
to collect no less than £23 14s. from the
crowd crossing that bridge. I forget who
won.
“Bub”: It’s the unplanned-for things
that knock you. I didn’t mind the sight
of a thatched roof in deep Oxfordshire
sporting a television aerial; I got
used to seeing huge red double-decker
buses thundering along bramble lanes ; I
could even shake off colored neon-light-
ing on a 16th-century pub as sporadic
bad taste. But when I looked at the small
circle of longish stones nestling, homely,
on the downs, I silently put my camera
away. I didn’t have the heart to record
the smallness of Stonehenge,

“8.A.K.”: There was a time when I
bought the soft-drink bottle as I paid
for the contents ; it was mine. If I chose
to return the empty the shopkeeper
bought it back for a penny. Then came
a new order: a proclamation embossed
on the side of the bottle informed me
that the container remained the property
of the company. But I still had to pay
for the thing I wasn’t allowed to possess.
That wasn’t all. Shopkeepers developed
a snooty attitude towards customers who
asked for a refund on empties. Finally
returning bottles became taboo. The
wheel turned again. Bottles suddenly
became things of value. Manufacturers
issued an edict: “Full bottles will be left
equivalent only to the number of
empties.” Autocrats who had refused to
accept returns were now adamant in their
refusal to sell a full bottle unless a dead-
’un was produced. At the moment that
arrangement prevails in some shops, but
there are still pitfalls. Last week I
sailed into a shop with a couple of dozen
to be replenished for Easter—and received
the curt answer: “They’re no good ; that
firm doesn’t deliver here now.” So I’m
stuck with a stack of articles I bought,
but don’t own. The seller doesn’t want
’em, and the owner won’t come and get
’em. I’m wondering whether he could
prosecute me for detaining them; or
whether I should charge his bottles with
trespassing.

“Brier”: A newsreel at present going
the rounds of suburban theatres shows a
class of girls undergoing secretarial train-
ing. One scene catches them during a
lesson in correct speech. At this point
the narrator’s voice says “It is good to
know that these girls are learning how
our language should be spoken—so many
of we Australians are careless in the way
we speak.”

“Spasebo”; Of all strange obsessions it
would be hard to beat that of Donald
G. Wing, librarian of Yale University.
Twenty years ago he set out to make a
complete index of all books printed
between 1641 and 1700 in England, Scot-
land, Ireland, Wales and the British
Americas, and he has just finished his
monumental task with 80,000 titles. This
piece of research-work has been an
inspiration to me, and I have set out to
make a complete index of the comics my
grandson, aged 12, has read since he was
five. Mr. Wing filled only 52 shoe-boxes
with over a million entries in compiling
his index; I expect to beat that easily—
if only I can get the shoe-boxes,

“Nakh”: I am immensely pleased with
this Washington story of the colonel’s
wife who didn’t just want puddings and
pies but a double-frontage to the cot-
tage the U.S. Air Force was building for
her at Casablanca, that port in French
Morocco Hollywood has endowed with a
romantic halo. As she got her double-
frontage all the other officers’ wives in
the same street wanted double-frontages
too, and as there were a lot of them, and
the length of the street was doubled, as
also the gas-mains, electric-light, water-
and sewerage-mains, the extra cost to
Uncle Sam was a million dollars, about
which a Senate sub-committee is now

asking awkward questions. Hollywood
has put forth several films about Casa-
blanca in which a young man meets a
girl and they fall in love at a Paris
night-club, but are parted by the
exigencies of war and don’t see one
another again until they accidentally meet
in Casablanca and she turns out to be
married to a stout elderly major in whom
she isn’t interested and the noble young
man steps out of the picture and takes
the next plane to Argentina, What a far
better subject that double-frontage would
make.

“8.J.L.”: Polite language (B.
19/3/’52)? Reminds me of the time Big
Dan smashed his thumb when working
with Wilson’s gang. One of the questions
on the “Claim for Compensation” form
was: “Did claimant report accident to
foreman? If so, how did he describe
it?” In the vacant space Wilson wrote:
“He remarked, ‘Oh, I say, old chappie,
bruised the jolly old knuckles, you know.
Beastly nuisance, what.’ ” Then, in block
print “OR WORDS TO THAT

“Salmon Gums”: The American
character who aims to give the Yanks “a
fair squeal” in the Presidential elections
recalls an aspirant to W.A. political
honors in the days before party politics
destroyed individuality in candidates. A
colorful career had carried this chap over
a lot of outback W.A., and he spoke with
a force and fluency picked up in the
mining-camps and on the stock-routes.
He addressed his meetings from horse-
back, drew a crowd with an exhibition —
surprisingly good—of boomerang-throw-
ing, and clinched his arguments with a
stockwhip. He made one promise—if
elected, to rob the country as effectively
as his colleagues. He wasn’t given the
opportunity to keep it.

“Elgey”: North Queensland has been
the scene of many a mighty drinking feat,
but one of the most spectacular stands to
the credit of Johnny Griego, a brown-
skinned Mexican who must have been
about the smallest man in the U.S. Army
and the possessor of its biggest thirst.
Lucey’s pub at Mt. Garnet was out of
bounds to Johnny and his mates, but one
blazing hot day six of them sneaked
into the bar and ordered six pots
of beer and six double-whiskies.
The drinks had just been paid for
when their 0.c.. Captain Pitts, and two
lieutenants walked into the lounge-bar
opposite. Johnny’s mates bolted, but
Johnny just sank down out of sight. The
barman, watching curiously, didn’t have
to wait long before a skinny little brown
claw reached up over the edge of the
bar, groped around and slowly drew a
glass back down. As it returned empty
Johnny’s head rose a little, and down
went another glass. He could see what
he was doing now ; down went two pots
of beer, then a double-whisky followed
by a pot. The captain and loots must
have been very interested in their confab
or been turning a blind eye as Johnny
had reached his full height; his eyes were
level with the top of the bar-counter. He
didn’t care who saw him now; General
MacArthur couldn’t have scared him
away from that bar. Slowly and deliber-
ately he drained glass and pot alternately,
Lingeringly the last went down. With a
long, glassy-defiant glare at his superiors
Johnny about-turned, marched heavily
out to the back entrance, failed to make
the descent of the two back steps and
crashed into the arms of his envious
waiting buddies.

“Bo”: Let captains of industry, with
their effete, inefficient and non-bureau-
cratic methods, stick to the old ways of
regulating the sunlight through the
windows of buildings they control by
putting the Venetian blinds on the inside.
It has remained for a State Government
authority—in Sydney, need it be said —
to show them just how you should do
these things. It puts them on the out-
side. Certainly the blinds, exposed as
they are to the weather, might appear
as if they are badly in need of half-soling
and heeling, most of the slats leaning at
a variety of drunken angles. Yet surely
it must be conceded that, rain being free,
the department has thereby cleverly saved
the cost of keeping them clean. And let
those who sneer at what they deem just
another example of Governmental inepti-
tude face this consideration, which must
weigh heavily against all others: the fact
of being thus enabled to get an un-
interrupted and constant view of their
reflections in the windows is surely
guaranteed to keep the typists happy and
contented!

“Blue P.”: I’ll hazard a guess that the
origin of “Haves” and “Have-nots” (B.

Marshall, Hamilton, Kent the publishers),
Sancho, after an enormous feed, tells his
master that he isn’t worried at having

“Carriwitchet”: Servants’ wages (B.
26/3/’52) were much the same out here
40 years ago. When we kids came in
after school we would find the servant-
girl patiently cleaning many windows or
polishing the silver. She lit the fires at
6.30 a.m., and, after cooking and clean-
ing all day, her duties ended with the
evening washing-up—that is, unless she
had the folding and mangling to do in
preparation for tomorrow’s befrilled and
much-belaced ironing. For all this —wdh
alternate Sunday afternoons off —she was
paid the extravagant sum of Bs. a week,
and her mistress saw to it that she earned
it. Let no one wonder why nowadays
there is no such animal as a general
servant.
“Bohemian”: *For what is believed to
be the first time in New Zealand the

Wellington trampers in the Tararua

Field Peak, and saw their images pro-
jected on to the clouds below them,
was about 6 p.m., and a halo of rainbow
colors was cast around each image, tne
illusion, they reported, lasted about l
seconds. Atmospheric conditions are
responsible for the phenomenon, wmc
was first observed on the Brocken in tne
Hartz Mountains in Saxony.

“An advertisement in the ‘Washington Post’ read:
‘Too Busy to Paint? Call on Ghost Artists. We
Paint it — You Sign it.’ ”
The future looks more optimistic
For millionaires who feel artistic
But are too busy, or who ain’t
The kind to mess about with paint—
There now awaits their acquisition
A picture, or an exhibition,
Brand-new, and with a dotted line
On which the millionaire can sign;
A man who’d rather break his neck
Than put his name on a dud cheque
Will see no fault involving strictures
In signing galleries of dud pictures.
A wife may say, “Aha! That model!”
To which he’ll answer, “Don’t talk twaddle.
My art is most discreet, my pet—
I’ve never seen a model yet.”
The wife will say, “It looks a freak;
There’s no design; the drawing’s weak.”
And he’ll reply, “That well may be—
I didn’t paint it; don’t blame me.”
The wife will say, “You’re insincere!”
But he’ll reply, “Although, my dear,
I didn’t paint it, it’s as bad,
You must admit, as if I had.”
And time will bring a critic-service
For the painter rich and nervous;
A tactful and resourceful guy,
Versed in Bell and Roger Fry,
Observing, in a golden glare
Design and Vision everywhere,
Will see the Bank Cheque as the norm—
Both life and art’s Significant Form,
And end by being no more wrong
Than critics papers send a10ng....
For Art is long, and Artists short,
And artists’ dinners must be bought.

“Bass”; Eastern States crooks who
regard sober young Perth as a plum ripe
for picking might find food for thought
in some recent Perth police-court
revelations. According to the prosecu-
tion a 1950-model sedan, valued at £lOOO,
was taken from a city parking-area, sold
to a dealer for £B5O and then returned to
the parking-spot. The next day the same
dodge was worked —for £750 —with a
different car. As the 28-year-old de-
fendant was committed for trial a chap
who was obviously proud of his city
assured me that “it couldn’t have been
done slicker in Sydney.”

“Pip Tok”: British composer Herbert
Howells (B. 13/2/’52) is right in refusing
to blame politics for the “unmitigated
dreariness of the ‘Red Flag.’ ” Early in
the century, boys in the modern-languages
classes at Sydney’s Fort-street were taught
an old French folksong, “Mon Beau
Sapin,” and its German equivalent, “O
fannenbaum,” both of which were sung
to the same dirge-like music. The tune
was allied to political propaganda, prob-
"Switch the engine off, silly—you'll Waken Father!"
ably for the first time, as long ago as the
American Civil War. At the time, the
State of Maryland was almost equally
divided in its sympathies between the
north and the south. A poem, “My
Maryland,” which urged the State to join
the Confederacy, was sung to the tune,
and Confederate sympathisers from
Maryland began to refer to themselves as
belonging to “the My Maryland half.”
The adoption of the unmitigated dreari-
ness by the Commos came much later.

“Shadow-chaser”: While listening to a
“Mystic Talk” in the Hawthorn Town
Hall (Vic.), two women fainted. Had
there been any “sports” present they
probably would have fainted, too, on
hearing the lecturer claim that the fall of
dice could be influenced by the mind of
the person throwing them. Consider a
few of the possibilities of this discovery.
Of what avail the loaded dice or the
double-header against a man with the
psychic mind compelling the dice to roll
and the pennies to fall in obedience to his
magic call. And should horses and their
riders respond to psychic influences it
would certainly add to the punters’
problems—it’s no use swabbing a
mesmerised horse.

“Yair”: On the way to King’s Cross
we passed a schoolkid scoffing three

stomach! ”

“Pawang”: Touching the report that
has horrified some Mildurans that New
Australians, when engaged in fruit- and
grape-picking, carry a bucket into which
they drop snails to take home for their
dinners, another dietetic item comes from
Paris. Ten journalists there have clubbed
together to buy an English horse which
figured as the hero in a British film called
“The Galloping Major,” in which a neddy
owned by an amateur syndicate wins the
Grand National. Each will contribute
£25 and buy the horse and race it, and
if it doesn’t win they vow they’ll eat it.
As far as I can see they can’t lose, well-
cooked horse being one of the delicacies
of Paris. Australian horse-lovers who are
shocked at this desecration can rest
assured that the animal will be treated
with the utmost deference, and it will
probably take a week to prepare it for
the table. It takes four or five days and
several varieties of wine to prepare snails
in the French fashion.

“Spokeshave”: An acute shortage of

school in Melbourne, even a fee of 6s.
an hour for posing in the nude having
failed to attract girls, so now the artists
themselves are posing for one another —
but not in the nude, one paper hastens
to inform its readers. Well, why not in
the nude? What reason would the
students give for this reservation? Do
they think that the girl who takes her
clothes off and stands up in public in
the altogether is doing something wrong?
If it isn’t wrong for them to look at
another person’s naked figure, why should
it be wrong for their own to be looked
at? Surely the artists aren’t going to
place themselves in the same position as
a Melbourne art patron who admired
a nude he saw in an exhibition and
asked the artist how much he wanted for
it, “Oh, for the portrait of my wife?”
said the artist. “Two-hundred guineas.”
“No, it’s not a portrait I’m after,” said
the patron. “It’s a nude.” “It’s both a

who had a long police record as a safe-

the slightest scar on his granite conscience,
with one exception. That was when
dire necessity drove him into pushing a
knife through the slot of the money-box
belonging to his landlady’s little girl and
sliding out half-a-dozen florins. With
obviously sincere emotion he confessed to
me he would carry with him always the
feeling of self-loathing the deed gave him.

“Mark O’Polo” on Solomon’s glory:
“Archaen” (B. 19/3/’52) has only to read the
First Book of Kings again to realise that
“Clooter” has got Solomon in about the correct
perspective. The splendor of his contemporaries
had nothing to do with Solomon’s 9wn glory,
except by way of emphasising its relative poverty
and crudity. Even the enthusiastic exaggeration
of the Hebrews’ own scribes, who wrote it all
up while captive in Babylon a couple of cen-
turies later, can’t disguise the true story. Who
were Solomon’s contemporaries? Only the
mighty Assyrians and the polished Egyptians,
joint masters of their known world. The latter,
in a temporary decline, used the half-civilised
Israelites as a buffer against the former, which
accounts for a Pharaoh giving a daughter to
Solomon in marriage. Solomon “brought her
into the city of David until he had made an
end of building his own house.” This house,
twice the size of the attached temple, was IUU
cubits (150 ft.) by 50 cubits (75ft.), the size of an
average Australian suburban block, and the 13
years he took to build it makes modern Australian
builders seem like honest triers. Another man
who used Solomon to advantage was Hiram ot
Tyre. For supplying Solomon with the tew
super feet of timber he wanted for the palace
from his extensive Lebanese cedar stands, Hiram
was given an open road from Tyre right through
Palestine to the Red Sea, where he helped
Solomon to build trading ships, and manned
them for him. The arrangement was mutually
beneficial, and the 12 tribes prospered as never
since Abraham. It was a brief glory. Solomon
died after taxing his people beyond the limit,
working them like slaves and squandering ms
wealth on trinkets and women. At his deatn
the little kingdom split in two. Trade died witn
Hiram, and a few years later the Egyptians, on
the upgrade again, subdued both Israel and
Judah, trampled Jerusalem down, looted the
palace and temple and started the Hebrews off
again on the road to bondage and obscurity.
It’s all in the Book.

“Piston Pete”: My belief in the
generosity of country folk has received a
jolt. Sixty people rolled up to a tin-
kettling for which the bridegroom pro-
vided the “niner.” A collection was
taken up and I was asked to make the
presentation. In doing so I stressed that
the contents of the envelope would buy
a little memento of the occasion, it
contained 36-bob, six of which were
mine!

“60-Off”: For me The Bulletin,
26/3/’52, had a couple of gems. Page 12
gave us that poem by Will Ogilvie, The
Umbrella Mulga.” Four rhymes to four
lines, singing stuff, a pleasant taste m the
memory and a story to be told. The
story could be condensed into a par.
But the whole thing was redolent of the
bush, of the old days, and it was the sort
of thing that could be recited round a
campfire. That’s what I call poetry,
Then, page 32, “The Habit of Com-
mand,” by A. F. Prior. Moderns might
speak scornfully of this as a magazine
story. If so. I’ll buy a couple of maga-
zines just to taste the red meat of a real
yarn —one with a beginning, a middle, a
plot, a climax —ending on the last line.
I got my money’s worth from that story.
When I’d read it I didn’t sigh with relief
to think that was another job done: I
turned back and read the thing again.
That is the test of a story: Is it worth
reading a second time? Modern stuff
may suit moderns, but I’m too old to
jitterbug. Give me the old-time waltz,
either in prose or poetry.

“Pat”: It was one of those surprise
parties where everyone carts along their
own bottle and dish of food. When
supper was being passed round one lass
was intrigued by a male who staunchly
refused all dishes proffered him. “What s
wrong? On a diet?” she asked. He
confided that he was holding his horses
until his wife’s contribution appeared.
“I get into trouble if I don’t go for her
stuff.” “I’ll easily fix that,” said the girl.
“What did she bring?” “Oh, little mince-
pie things,” explained the male. He got
into trouble all right. Wife, together with
the other organising ladies in the kitchen,
had repudiated all connection with the
doughy pies, blandly agreeing to consign
them to the garbage. “No one would
ever have known if you’d just kept quiet
and eaten the other things,” she com-
plained bitterly.

“Bass”: Horse-manure with a high
percentage of wood-shavings (B.
19/3/’52) wouldn’t necessarily be inferior
to the “pure” article. I once worked in a
woodyard, and every so often the heap of
dirt which had once been banksia-bark
had to be disposed of. I used a few loads
to fill in a depression in a patch of
swampy ground, and was later amazed
at the fertility of that patch. I tried the
same dodge with sawdust —both banksia
and jarrah—and found that it soured the
ground for a few weeks, but was a good
fertiliser after that.
“Brick E.”: *Our jobs are directly
opposite some new cottages that have
recently been tenanted. The occupiers
all seem to be garden-conscious ; which
might be a good thing—if the borders
were not of brick. You can’t swear to
a brick, but there is nothing to stop you
thinking. Some weeks ago a lady sent
over a note: Would the builder lend her
husband a barrow for the weekend, and
could he have the old half-bricks? The
boss explained that two bats made a
whole and a whole brick cost him about
3i-d., but he willingly lent the big, rubber-
tyred barrow. On Monday morning a
heap of bats had gone. A kid—those
priceless little tip-offs volunteered.
“Mr. So-and-so took a lot of broken
bricks in the barrow. He put them on
top of some big bricks.” Next Friday
a note came over again: “May we borrow
the barrow again?” That’s when the
boss went crook. “Hang it all,” he
roared. “I can’t stop ’em from pinching
my bricks, but I’m hanged if I’m gping

ABORIGINALITIES
“Nor’-west”: Running down from
Derby (n.-w. W.A.) in a lugger, we had
as passenger an ancient aboriginal whose
home port was Carnarvon, 1000 miles
south. Stiff southerly winds made sailing
a matter of tacking in practically all
directions except north. But no matter
which way the lugger might be heading
old Paddy could always point straight to
where his home lay. Efforts were made
to try to trick him, as asking him at
night down below in the cabin. But he
was always correct, as the skipper on
consulting the compass could verify. This
instinct of direction is, of course,
to the world’s primitives on land ; but
that it should function far out on the
trackless sea was something I have never
been able to understand.
“Blue Billy”: Mention of the Thursday
Island registration of goats (B. 19 /3 / ’52)
reminds me of the time an experimentally-
minded Queensland shire council
imported some goat aristocrats with
a view to boosting the milk-production
of the next generation of the
town’s milkers. A hotly-protesting
shire engineer was saddled with the
responsibility of overseeing the valeting
of the lordly sires, the appointment of
their services and a monthly report on
the progress of the experiment. At the
next meeting of the council he duly tabled
the required report. In this document
he had named each of his charges after
one of the local Bumbles, and managed to
infuse the record of the doings of each
goat with a curiously apposite reference
to the foibles of its human counterpart.
With it was the engineer’s resignation,

“Chink”: “Shamuspen” (B. 19/3/’52)
was mainly correct regarding the massacre
by aborigines, in 1861, of 19 whites on
Cullin-la-Ringo station, in Queensland’s
Dawson Valley, but he was astray in
naming the owner of the property —that
unfortunate fellow was Horatio Spencer
Wills. As a youth in Sydney he began a
colorful career by shipping as a cabin-
boy and spending a couple of years as a
castaway on a Pacific island. Returning,
he married at 21 a girl of 17 and became
a pastoral pioneer of the Murrumbidgee.
Seven or eight years later (about 1839) he
trekked south to central Victoria, eventu-
ally bringing his “ark” to rest at a mount
which he called Ararat —hence the name
of a town in the area. In 1852 Wills sold
his Ararat property, Lexington, for
£35,000 and moved to a spot near Gee-
long, which district he represented for a
while in the first Victorian Leg. Assembly.
In 1860 the restless pioneer decided on
another and bigger trek than his journey
south from the ’Bidgee—he got together
his employees and their families, plus
flocks and herds, and started overland for
Queensland’s Dawson Valley. That
journey, one of the greatest of its kind
in Australian history, occupied 10 months.
But within a fortnight of their arrival at
Cullin-la-Ringo 19 of the 22 pioneers, in-
cluding the 50-year-old H. S. Wills, were
murdered. Mrs. Wills, who had remained
temporarily in Victoria, lived on to the
age of 90. One of her sons, Tom,
captained a Victorian cricket XL A
daughter, Emily, married H. C. A.
Harrison (B. 2/4/’52), “father” of
Australian football.

“Mat’s Mate”: The real boss of the
place was the boss’s wife, a stern-lipped,
large woman who wore thick spectacles
and had little to say but could quell her
man with a glance. She even had Mat
a trifle scared —at first —and he confided
to me that he’d have chucked the job
only he was sure the boss would cop
trouble if he did. It was a pretty dry time,
and, after a week, the tucker faded away
a bit. Mat complained, the boss said
he’d see to it. That night the missus put
her spectacled eyes on Mat and said
coldly “What you’ve got on your plate is
plenty for any man, as I can well see.”
Mat looked at her, then he stood up,
reached across, took her spectacles off
and growled “Look at it now, without
them magnifying-glasses of yours.” She
was so taken aback that she put the
glasses on again, put more tucker on our
plates and then withdrew. But it was no go;
next morning the boss gave us our time.

“Piper”: Tell “Swelpm e” (B.
26/3/’52) that the small brown “fairy”
penguin is no rarity on N.S.W. south
coasts. I’ve even seen them gambolling
in our ’arbor, where, if oil affects their
buoyancy, you wouldn’t expect them to
stay afloat for five minutes. The little
birds nest thickly on Bowen Island at
the entrance to Jervis Bay. On the
western side, sheltered, but also swelter-
ing with heat, they nest in the summer.
There’s a lot of dry ribbon-like seaweed
washed up there, and this hides their
burrows. The nest itself is above high-
water mark,
* * * *
Jayoh : Tell Ceg (B. 19/3/ 52)
that Strawberry most likely got her
name from the strawberry-roan which
appeared in most dairy herds during the
development of the A.I.S. breed. In
N.Q., when the A.M.S., as it was then
known, first made its appearance, there
seemed to be a preponderance of the
strawberry-marked beasts in every dairy
herd which had departed from the
traditional “Jersey for cream, Holstein or
Ayrshire for milk” tradition. The
establishment of the breed on a firm
footing, and its subsequent development
into the Australian Illawarru Shorthorn,
nevertheless still allows for red, red-and-
white and strawberry-roan represent-
atives in the show-ring. And the
“ You'll never make a paratrooper, Tocker!"
strawberry-roan is a handsome beast, not
to be confused with the less-glamorous
brindle.
* * * *
“Gravelsnatcher”: “Bogaduck” ' may
shift that termite-mound (B. 19/ 3/ ’52),
but I doubt if he’ll shift the termites.
Don’t know what proportion of a termite
nest is above ground, but I’d say it was
very small. The bulk of the nest is
placed where even burning sump-oil
wouldn’t reach it, and the little cows are
remarkably quick to adapt themselves
to changed conditions. I recall a pad-
dock which, 30 years ago, carried
hundreds of termite mounds to the acre.
The bloke who established a nursery on
it smashed those mounds methodically,
digging well below ground-level, and the
place has been ploughed and spaded con-
sistently ever since. Now there isn’t a
sign of a termite mound, and a visitor
would be pardoned for thinking the
builders had been beaten. But a piece
of pine left lying anywhere is attacked
within 48 hours. With their homes
smashed and their food sources reduced
to a minimum, the termites have managed
to live and possibly increase.
* * * •
“The Missus”: The compass and
measuring-wheel contraption or a variant
of it (B. 19/3/’52) was used for early
survey work in at least one district on
the mainland as well as in Tasmania.
My father, son of one of the district’s
earliest settlers, told us of one surveyor
who did most of his work from a gig.
A rag was tied to the wheel and the
revolutions counted as the vehicle was
driven up hill and down dale, measure-
ments being computed from the count so
made. The boundaries so defined stood
for a long time, though later surveys
showed up plenty of errors. I remember
one of the district’s most respected
citizens presenting 100 acres of land to
the Crown for a community-development
project. The formal presentation was
made with a great deal of ballyhoo, back-
slapping speeches and rounds of cheering
from the schoolchildren —mainly, I recall,
because the visiting Minister gave us a
holiday. “Very nice,” was Dad’s dry
comment, “and a neat way of handing
back the area for which there’s never been
any title, thanks to an error in the original
survey. A lot cheaper than paying extra
legal costs and back rates and taxes
involved in hanging on to it —after all,
his family’s used it for nothing for
seventy-odd years.”
* * * *
“Macquarie”: It may be sound advice
that even Eastern “remedies” should be
investigated before being dismissed as
quackery (B. 19/3/’52); but, unfor-
tunately, an alarming percentage of
gullible Australians accept the alleged
cures at the claimant’s valuation and
never bother about the investigation. To
such people the word “herbalist,” and
particularly “Chinese herbalist,” suggests
miracle-working, magic potions veiled in
Celestial mystery far beyond the ken of
orthodox medical men. I have never
been able to figure out how a herbalist
retains his title when he dispenses crow
dunked in whisky,
crow’s liver and the
gall-bladder of a
bear —or the in-
famous “bear’s
stomach” of the Jap
prison camp. Never-
theless I’ve been told
in all seriousness:
“Oh, but he doesn’t
use ordinary
medicines; he gives
you herbs.” Which
reminds me of the
tale about the two
brothers who
worked a small farm
together. One morn-
ing a feminine
neighbor met George
as he came limping
out of the local
medico’s surgery.
Under her quizzing
he answered shortly :
“Doc. says it’s
fibrositis ; gave me a
prescription to get
made up.” The old
girl promptly rushed
in with her propa-
ganda : “What do
you want to get that
rubbish made up for
—why don’t you
take herbs?” George
stared at her in
amazed disgust.
“The stoopidest
thing I ever heard,”
he exploded. “Here’s
me with fibrositis
and Herb with
gastric-’flu—-what the
hell would be the good of Herb’s
medicine to me?”
* * ♦ ♦
“Slot”; Dogs, psychologists say, can’t
think. Granted, but our quarter-bred
Scotch terrier gave a passable imitation
when about 15 months old. One Christmas
Eve, expecting guests the next day, my
mate and I took our 12-bores and Scotty
to the creek
and dam.
There were
ducks
about, and
some of the
first we shot
fell into the
water.
Scotty swam
out and
fetched
those that
were dead.
But those that were only wounded
waited till he was a yard or so away and
dived. When they came up he was after
them, and again they disappeared. Scotty
couldn’t believe it. We had to shoot
them again before he could retrieve them.
After a while the mob flew along the
creek and I dropped one about 10ft.
from the water’s edge, where Scotty was.
In he dashed. The duck was sitting up,
watching. Scotty stopped, swam back,
ran a few yards up the bank, turned,
charged down and took a flying leap that
landed him fair on top of the duck. The
spread on Christmas day was a great
success.

“M.S.”: “Horse sense!” snorted Kelly,
pausing, bridle in hand, to eye the big
chestnut making hurriedly for the far
corner of the paddock. “They talk about
animals havin’ brains. Don’t you believe
it. Trouble with horses is they
haven’t got any sense o’ proportion. This
nag o’ mine, now, he’s always bin a bit
inclined t’ move off when he seen me
cornin’, but now the cow’s hopeless. See
this tree?” He indicated an enormous
gum that had fallen out by the roots.
“Well, that’s what did it. Y’ see, I was
after the moke and was in a bit of a
hurry like, an’ o’ course he spots the
bridle and walks away. I yelled a couple
o’ times, an’ when he didn’t stop I bent
down an’ picked up a stick and tells him
what I’ll do in a minute if he ain’t care-
ful. He looked at me, sort o’ doubtful,
then just as he turns t’ go on that there
tree falls fair beside him. He knew he
was lucky to get off with only a tew
scratches instead o’ bein’ driven into the
ground; but, just the same, nothin wm
ever make the goat believe I never pelted
the thing at him.”
THE DESERT PEOPLE.
South of Momtra netting the ironstone gibbers
lie,
Black ’neath blackened tartmsh and hard grey
bindi-eye;
Black in the blaze of noonday, as in the moon-
light black —
But in every heap of stone there and every
gaping crack
Lizard folk and beetles and teeming ants abide,
Where thronged in hidden cities the desert
peoples hide.
North and west of Wonoka, red the sandhills
glow—
Thin grey foam of mulga, the hissing crests
below—
But though the drifts are naked where red fire
hearths have lain
(Coolness, greenness, shadow are in a horse-
man’s brain)
Tunnelled down to darkness the little people
cling
And in the drifted canegrass cicadas shrilly sing.

“Old-timer”: Quicksilver Ted and
Calico Charlie, mustering stragglers in
the lignum swamps on the Merran
Yarran, below Moulamein (N.S.W.), got
caught in a heavy white fog. The cattle
disappeared, and all they could see were
their horses’ heads. “Can’t do nothin’
in this,” Calico grunted as he looked
round and saw nothing but fog. “Hey,
Ted!” he cried. No answer. He called
some more, appealing to Ted not to be a
ruddy fool, but got only silence. The
fog was full of strange lights from the
early-morning sun, and every now and
then a swirl would identify itself as a
steer and disappear again. Aware of the
foolishness of riding aimlessly about in
the white opaqueness. Calico got off his
horse, hung the bridle over one arm and
was rolling a cigarette when Quicksilver
appeared on foot, snatched the trailing
bridle, growled “You wander again, y’
moth-eaten screw, an’ I’ll kick y’r ribs
in,” and before Calico could say a word
leapt on the horse and vanished. It took
two minutes of yelling to bring him
back, when he disgustedly agreed that
he’d picked the wrong horse, his own
having wandered, and swore he hadn’t
seen Calico the first time. And if you
don’t believe it you’ve never been in a
Merran Yarran fog just after sun-up on
an autumn morning.

“Irving”: In the mother-of-pearl fleets
of Torres Strait the camp-oven (B.
19/3/’52) is far from being on the
way out. Particularly on the Binghi-
owned, -manned and -skippered cutters
and ketches the useful article gets No. 1
priority on the list of chandlery bought
before each drift. Without it Binghi, who
eschews “white-feller bread” (“ ’im too
mush holes”), could not concoct, on the
formula of one Boz. tin of baking-
powder to one 501 b. bag of flour, the
weighty dampers which are his staff of
life. The camp-oven and two kero.-tins
resting on a sheet of galvanised-iron
amidships are the only culinary gear
necessary to turn out the means of
gastronomically satisfying the crew of
20. Hot crayfish between wads of
smoking damper thickly smeared with
newly-opened tinned butter make a feed
that brings the tortures of the damned
to the participants some 20 minutes later.
But they love that tucker so much they
cheerfully put up with the aftermath.

“Anturopo”: Mention has often been
made by eastern - Staters in The
Bulletin of the bloodwood - tree.
Couldn’t identify it myself, but it would
be a good name for the Westralian red-
gum, which bleeds “kino” like a pig
“She flies like a bird , sir, but there's a slight oil-leak somewhere."
when cut with an axe. It is a large tree,
but its wood is practically useless for
lumber. Kino, though not much
exploited, makes powerful tanning fluid.
Old-timers of the W.A. south-west often
used it for tanning and preserving fishing-
nets. It loomed large, too, in the primi-
tive aboriginal’s pharmacopoeia, being the
standard application for severe burns,
spear-wounds and cuts. During World
War ’ I modern medicine, in a way,
reverted to kino when it was found
there was no finer salve for burns than
tannin in a semi-solid form, tannin jelly :
which does not differ very much, chemi-
cally, from the kino of the now long-
passed abo. practitioner. Kino, too,
applied to a wound is an excellent repel-
lant of flies.
“E.”;* “R. Ney” (B. 12/3/’52) is a bit
out in claiming that a sheepdog which,
irrespective of weather or conditions, does
not work must be either tied-up or dead.
Granted that most sheepdogs take their
work seriously ; nevertheless, they have a
dead-line where work is concerned. The
two sheepdogs I’m working now are an
old kelpie-cross and an eager little dog
hard to hold when the job starts ; but as
the temperature rises and the work grows
tiresome the eager one is always the
first to chuck it. The kelpie-cross, too,
spells one foot after another, and drags
slower, and only urging keeps him
from retiring to a spot he knows under
the shed. Apart from the deadline of
the better workers, there’s a smattering
of laziness in some members of the
breeds. Bought a kelpie pup one time,
and, as he shaped well, I spent consider-
able time on his training, till I had him
thorough and obedient. Then summer
arrived, and the dog refused point-blank
to work in the heat. Flopping in the
nearest shade, he’d wait till I’d cursed
the jumbucks on another 100 yards or so,
then he’d drift along to the next con-
venient shade-tree.
* * * *
“Moyhu”; Well-known is the Too’s
making for a waterhole when cornered
by dogs, but in such cases he always
manages to keep one toe on the bottom
to lend power to the other as he brings
it down the full length of the hound’s
belly. In deep water, however, the ’roo
can be as speedy as an otter, using the
short powerful forearms to draw the
tapering body along. But, contrary to
what might be expected, the tail, which
on land serves as a balance while the ’roo
is in motion or as a prop while stationary,
isn’t used at all while its owner is swim-
ming. The member is stretched out
straight behind, parallel to the hind-legs,
which also are trailed. The heavy rear
parts are kept afloat apparently by the
speed with which the animal moves
through the water.

“Curate’s Egg”: In a little kipsy on the
banks of the Warrego (W.Q.) I met an
old-timer who did not accept resignedly
the disturbance of his slumbers by the
nocturnal nibbling of mice inside the
walls of his dwelling (B. 6/ 5 / ’52). The
shack was lined with thickly-whitewashed
hessian, and the appearance would have
been quite pleasing but for the fact that
the surface was marred by dozens of
round holes. Noting my curiosity, old
Tom explained; “The blasted mice come
to eat the paper which I’ve used to pack
behind the hessian. I always know where
they are by the bulges they make on the
wall, and they’re sittin’ shots. I used to
get ’em first with a darning-needle poked
into a cork, but the blanks got too cun-
ning. It was cheaper spearin’ ’em, mind
you, but this is better sport,” He patted
the .22 rifle beside him.
A BUSH BARDS’ BATCH
THE FARMER’S WIFE.
I shall never make a poem
As the farmer’s wife made tea,
With wisdom’s slow mill-water
And a homespun tale at three.
I shall never make an image
As she, in teapot size,
Brewed sleep in a steam of sunshine
Below the lupins of her eyes.
I shall never win the measure
Her golden apron made
As it filled the crinkled kitchen
With pleated light and shade.
I shall never set soft magic
In my moment, like this wife;
From the farmland cup she gave me
I drank all time and life.

THE RAIN.
The rabbits are out on the grassy patch,
Sitting up cocky and high,
The fowls are a dismal, moody batch;
But the ducks are alive and spry.
All’s a drizzly view of misty blue,
The sky’s not at home to the eye,
The fences look dark and wet and stark,
The placid cow is as wet as the plough,
And miniature creeks run by.
The chimney smoke looks good to a bloke,
The farm looks dreamy and grey,
There’s a grassy smell, and earthy as well,
And the rabbits are still at play.
The trunks of the trees are running wet,
The limbs have a frosty sheen,
The snails are out you can jolly well bet,
And eating the tender green;
Each garden flower lifts its face to the shower,
The leaves look polished and clean;
A Jack’s dived down where the loam is brown,
The speckled thrush stands in a hush
And watches the wormy scene.
Up on the road the traffic has slowed
Where the pools and slush are spread,
And a man in a dray plods on his way
With a chaff-bag over his head.

JAMBS HACKSION.
WHEN THE LAMBS TAKE CHARGE.
There are ewes and lambs in the sheepyard
wings
And the old ewes walk to the open gate,
But the long-tail lambs run round in rings
In the fear, perhaps, of approaching fate;
And, working out till they reach the marge
Of the milling mob, they seize their chance;
And as all men know when the lambs take
charge
There is nothing can stay their swift advance.
It’s little they care for a stockwhip’s crack,
And little they reck of a bark or bite,
And nothing on earth can hold them back
When fairly launched on their forward flight.
The cleverest dogs that are working wide —
Tweed and Connie and Nip and Nell —
Might just as well to the fence be tied
As try to manoeuvre those imps of Hell.
And old St, Clair can wheel on a plate,
And follow a steer and need no rein,
But the lambs come on like a stream in spate,
And split, and pass him, and join again;
And now, to their full content at large,
They race in the open, their dams forgot;
And we know when the long-tail lambs take
charge
To stop them it’s Buckley’s chance we’ve got.
So we take a cut from the bleating ewes
And hustle them out where their offspring
wait;
And they mix with their mothers, and none we
lose,
And gather the lot through the sheepyard gate.
But there isn’t a hand on a London barge
Can swear as a western stockman can
On a marking-day when the lambs take charge
And run the rule over dog and man.

OLD VILLAGE.
Each day belongs a hundred years ago,
Belongs to times of crinolines and lace,
Red-coated soldiers, pioneers and gold,
That started history in this tempered place.
Here is a convict wall, a church of stone,
A cobwebbed coach, a cellar dark and cold . . .
How strange it is such dank and crumbling
things
Can fascinate us just by being old.

IAN HEALY.
ALONG THE DRIFTER’S WAY.
The “wet”' has gone, the skies are clear
Above my sand-beach home;
The dragonflies and larks are here
To tell me I must roam.
So roll the swag, for this I know —
The urge comes on as seasons flow,
And a dreamjng-fool must ever go
Along the drifter’s way.
In craft well stowed with things I need
I sail along the shore,
To drift by reefs where curlews feed,
And hear the nankeen’s roar
As up a tidal stream I glide
Where crocodiles gape up then slide
Beneath the muddy swirling tide
That surges to a bore.
I camp by hills to sleep beside
Tree-ferns where waters flow,
I walk by cliffs where black men plied
Their cave-art long ago;
I hear the nutmeg-pigeon’s coo
Come over swamp-plains wet with dew,
And watch the crested-cockatoo
Feed where leichhardts grow.
One morning—where the spider weaves
Its web to a warbler’s song—
A Christbird swayed on lotus leaves,
Then danced and tripped along
To scare a “nail-tail” ’midst the reeds
By para-grass and wild-rice seeds
On which a buffalo quietly feeds,
To sniff when winds blow strong.
I camped beside that deep lagoon
Where lotus-lilies sway;
I watched the brolgas dance at noon;
I woke one breaking day
To hear the squawking, screeching cries
Of birds from plains, lagoons and skies
All calling me, “Arise!” “Arise!”
So I must on my way.
So I return where shades are deep
And cool beside the sea;
Where babblers cry, and geckos creep
Around my banyan tree.
And I watch the wild geese sailing by,
A thin black line on cloud-flecked sky,
And hear the leader’s honking cry;
He calls “Farewell!” to me.

MOON AND PEAR-TREE.
Pale as the pear-tree blossom, the new moon
floats
Like a fragile petal fallen into the sky;
The bees are busy among the white and green
But ignore that flower, they could not climb so
high.
Move your head an inch to the left, and see
That lovely curve of moon and flower are one,
The fallen blossom back on the tree; while now
It floats away to become once more a moon.
Here in the blossoming orchard where the grass
Grows long and green, a thousand insects’ flight
Against the sun becomes a cloud of fire,
Each one a speck of golden, living light.
And the blossoms hang like clusters of white
moons,
And the moon is soft as a petal ... so sense
can mock,
Making of inky specks a dance of flame
And a delicate flower of an old, scarred lump
of rock.

SUNSET CLOUD.
That anchored cloud in the red sunset seas,
All lit with gleaming snows, towering high,
Issues her challenge to the adventurous soul
Offering her bold and sharp declivities,
Her giddy ridges, rising to the sky,
Her violet vales, profound—ah, what a goal
Her summit, seamed with dying fire, shall be
For him who, peering deep in her recesses,
Ghostly with pallid mist, shall surely see
More wondrous things than any Shelley guesses —
Cliffs such as pilots look upon while flying
Over and through and through and over the
clouds —
Gloomy abysses, empty gullies lying
Void, vacant, still, and veiled with spectral
shrouds.
What though there be in those dead depths no
flower,
No moss, no fern, no thrush to shout and carol,
No lichen-silvered rock in fair apparel,
No dandelion clock to tell the hour?
At last, as easily as the falcon soaring,
He breasts the final spur, triumphant, spurning
The dusky earth’s illimitable flooring
And faints upon the spirit’s rabid burning.

SITTIN’ ON THE VERANDA.
“Siltin’ on the veranda all day long,
my old man” —says Sam—"and me,
ain’t much happens we don’t see.”
Sick young man and hale old-stager
barney, bicker, curse and wager.
All their world’s close-gathered here —
puss on the railing, dog on the stair;
big black Australorp, green in the wing
strutting past like a myall king.
Young man, old man, son and father,
cricket on the radio, races after;
mould’s on the lintel, blown leaves gather;
mite’s on the citrus, web’s on the rafter.
Morning paper and seatless pants,
flies, mosquitoes, a plague of ants . . .
Silas, Sam, no wife, no mother,
fond, yet tired, of one another,
all their life so simple, planned
that a hare in the weeds, or a whirl of sand,
rat in a bin, or a light-wire’s fuse,
snake in the closet, make big news.
Careless phrases, dropping slow
round their pipe-stems come and go,
with the fine ash drifting, falling,
paper rustling, Silas calling:
“See bread’s up? Meat’ll rise!
Why don’t they check it, damn their eyes?
Follows Roman holiday—
Sam and Silas slate and slay
some unmitigated They . . .
Yarning, yawning their lives away,
bidding a drowsy time o’ day
to the fringe of a human tide that flows
to the garden gate, and as quickly goes:
grocer, iceman, dustman, baker,
kindly soul and mischief-maker;
postman clad in shorts and sox,
with never a letter for their box
just a wave and a jest as he goes
past the leaning fence with the errant rose.
O God of gales and lurching seas,
plagues and ’quakes and world unease,
can it be You are kind to these? —
Sam and Silas, grey head, red,
shelved but sure of bread and bed;
their blessings summed in baccy, sleep,
and plonk that makes the pulses leap
every fortnight, clutching pay;
prosperous on Pension Day.
Is it fair or dismal fate
sets them lounging early, late,
sublimely able to ignore
the grisly Shadow at their door,
and let life drift by like a song,
sittin’ on the veranda all day long?

The spring of £18,473 in last year’s
declared net earnings was due to better
returns from shipping, which, for the
first time for many years, turned in more
than the co.’s big wad of outside invest-
ments. The fleet consists of two passenger
vessels—Wanganella and Westralia —and
half a dozen freighters. The Wanganella
is on the trans-Tasman run, and the
Westralia, which had been on charter
to the Government, ferrying troops, etc.,
to and from Japan, resumed trading on
the Australian coast in April, 1951, and
has since received “a full measure of
support.” One of the freighters, the
Corio, was wrecked off the South Aus-
tralian coast early in the term, and is to
be replaced by a new 6000-tonner, the
Woomera, now under construction by the
Commonwealth Government and due for
delivery about June next. Also, freight-
rates were raised during the year to help
offset the perennial rise in running and
other costs, which follow close on the
heels of recurrent wage-lifts, industrial
hold-ups, ashore and afloat, and the slow
turn-round of ships in port.
The co.’s outside investments com-
prise £1,252,280 (unchanged) in Govern-
ment securities and £1,438,507 (up
£56,789) in shares and debentures in other
cos., including J. and A. Brown and
Abermain-Seaham, Hebburn and Metro-
politan, all in the coal trade, and A.N.A.,
A.W.A., Melbourne Steam and Tas-
manian Steamers.
The profit shown in the introductory

* After allowing for depreciation, £65,544, 1949:

Last term’s net return from trading was
written after allowing an extra £39,151
for depreciation and sending £60,000 to
tonnage replacement reserve. Official
allowances for depreciation are inade-
quate for maintenance of real capital at
today’s cost of replacement, as the “Wild
Cat” has repeatedly pointed out. So the
co. has asked the Government to be a
realist and give up taxing part of capital
as well as profits by exempting from
income-tax that part of earnings set aside
for replacement of ships.
The £148,482 of profit claimed—there
might be a bit more wheat in the ear than
the eye can see—was enough to pay the
pref. div. and show 15.8 p.c. on the
£750,000 of ord, capital as against 13.3,
11.7, 14.7, 12.2 and 14.5 p.c. back to
1946. The div. was kept at 12 p.c., and,
subject to unexpected happenings, looks
like remaining there for the present.
With the recent strengthening of the
labor-force on the waterfront, and its
equipment with a few more mechanical
gadgets for handling cargo, a little relief
from the costly delay in the turn-round
of ships is hoped for. Also, there are
signs that the low net earnings of cos.
in the coal trade might improve a trifle,
air-freight- and passenger-rates have been
raised, and the Government proposes to
modify the unequal competition between
its own airline and A.N.A.
The next table shows how strongly-
ribbed the co. is financially:

t After deducting interest outside shareholders.
The parent and its three main sub-
sidiaries are an enterprising and efficient
group engaged in the manufacture of
women’s hosiery (mainly nylons), men’s
socks, rainwear and other apparel, in-
cluding women’s scarves, men’s dressing-
gowns, ties, shirts, etc. Development has
been rapid and profitable during the post-
war boom, and the management has done
much to consolidate the co.’s goodwill.
During the latter half of the last terra,
however, the economic barometer in the
hosiery and textile trades continued to
fall, and the co, cut its ord. div. for the
year from Ifijr p.c. to 6 p.c. The cut was
due not to a collapse of net earnings
but to the need to retain money in the
business. This need arose mainly from
an accumulation of stocks, following a
flood of imports, the tightening of bank
and other credit, increased taxation, and
growth of consumer resistance, which be-
came marked toward the close of
accounts. At the same time raw materials
from overseas came forward earlier and
in larger volume than the management
had budgeted for. The £200,000 of fresh
capital and premium money put up by
shareholders in July last, and more be-
sides, had gone into fixed assets —100,000
new £l5 p.c, prefs. were issued at par
and 572,000 new ss, ords. at 6s. 3d.
each.
Turnover of the group for the year
increased by no less than £1,066,844
(40 p.c,), reaching a record £3,737,599.
Yet net earnings got no benefit from the
overall bigger trading. That was because
manufacturing costs rose by 40.3 p.c.,
administrative costs by 43.8 p.c., provision
for taxation by 69.9 p.c. and the allow-
ance for depreciation by 41.4 p.c. After
eliminating outside shareholders’ interests,
the profit was £3766 short of the previous
year’s at £133,477. That was enough to
pay the pref. divs. (£18,215) and show
27.7 p.c. on average ord. capital as against
38.6, 27.3, 21.6 and 15.5 p.c, back to
1947. The cut in the div. allowed £90,336
(67.6 p.c.) of the year’s profit to be
ploughed back into the business.
But it was not enough. The overdraft
was increased by £215,395 and mortgages
by £59,280;

It was extensions to the parent’s own
properties in Vic., completion of the
Rydalmere (N.S.W.) building and new
plant installations that sent fixed assets
up £290,753 net. The contraction of
£36,777 in book-debts reflected the falling-
off of trade toward the close of accounts,
while reduced buying of raw materials
shows up in the drop of £9559 in the
creditor item.
The whole position at the moment
hinges on the stocks problem. Stocks
appear in the books at the lower of cost
or market-values ; how much lower is not
ascertainable from the published accounts.
Raw wool and other commodity prices
have eased since the books were ruled
off, but the effect upon the cost of locally-
spun yarns has since been largely offset
by basic-wage increases. Nevertheless,
the co. recently reduced selling-prices for
most of its products, and hopes to main-
tain the lower figures, though “wage-
rates may increase slightly,” This healthy
development is the result of greater effi-
ciency from operatives and executives
alike, the chairman says. Plant is modern
and efficient, and a lot of attention is
being given to quality, which promises
to become a much more important
factor in sales than it has been
of recent years. Import-restrictions
have provided a breathing-space for
readjustment in the industry. Mean-
while, a difficult period of trading
lies ahead while retailers reduce their pile
of imported goods before strengthening
their call upon local manufacturers. Since
an increasing amount of the purchasing-
power in the hands of the public is being
absorbed by expenditure on food and
transport, it is difficult to say how pro-
tracted the period of readjustment is
likely to be.
Noting all this, and the wide margin
between last term’s net earnings and
distributions, the market expresses its
confidence in the management by pricing
the ss. ords, at 6s. 7d. (ss. lid. in Feb,),
giving a return of 4.5 p.c,. on a 6 p.c. div.
basis. At 235. and 18s. 6d, the 6 p.c.
second and 5 p.c. third prefs. yield
5.2 p.c. and 5,4 p.c. respectively. The
well-protected firsts seldom appear on

To get these pastoral undertakings into
perspective it is necessary to consider
a number of things. These include loca-
tion and size of the holdings, amount
of capital to be fed, the risks of the
business —mainly seasons, prices and
costs —condition of the finances and cur-
rent economic and other trends. It also
needs to be remembered that average
rather than immediate return is the only
fair basis on which to assess long-term
investment prospects.
The co.’s big leaseholds, aggregating
some 9200 square miles, are in far-west
Queensland and over the border in the
Territory; and there are three coastal
fattening freeholds, totalling 45,000-odd
acres, in the Gladstone, Nanango and
Kilcoy districts. Its £325,000 of capital
is in 250,000 £1 6 p.c. cumulative par-
ticipating prefs. (they advance with the
ords. in any distribution beyond 6 p.c.)
and 600,000 ords. of 2s. 6d. each —the
other 17s. 6d. per share (£525,000) was
written off in 1932 to cover losses due to
drought, rising costs and anaemic markets.
With World War II came the stabilis-
ing influence of the British wool- and
meat-contracts, which meant ready mar-
kets at assured prices. Since the war
seasons have been fair to good, and
prices for both wool and livestock made
a rocket-like ascent, reaching their peak
in March, 1951. After a 22-year drought
the ords. came into the picture again in
1942 with 6 p.c., and have remained there
since, the rate being lifted to 10 p.c. in
1949 and to 12 p.c. for the two years
to the close of last accounts, when share-
holders could see the whole of their
capital intact and £162,178 besides.
After allowing £18,651 (up £3601) for
depreciation—which is included with
profits and then shown as written-off in
the table —and making adequate provision
for taxation and other contingencies, last
term’s net result was £1963 better at
£85,023, or 26.1 p.c. on capital (pref. and
ord. combined) as against 25.5, 13.9, 10.3,
11.1, 10.3 and 9.8 p.c. back to 1945. On
shareholders’ funds (capital and reserves
together) the £85,023 was 17.4 p.c..
However, when the writing-down of
capital and present exceptional conditions
are taken into account, there is an obvious
need for greater incentives by way of tax
and other concessions if capital is to be
attracted for further development of the
big pastoral holdings in the interior. The
co.’s performance last year was a credit-
able one considering the sharp drop in
wool prices, which were back to about
half the March peak by the end of
1951 (they have dropped further
since) and the drought conditions that
developed as the year advanced. Though
fewer calves were branded and lambs
marked, sales of livestock compared favor-
ably with the preceding couple of years.
Financially the co. is better shod than
it has ever been, and is in a strong posi-
tion to withstand a jolt. Note the large

Recent rains have broken
Queensland’s year-long drought
in most districts and given sub-
stantial relief in others. Still,
supplies of store cattle are likely
to be affected for some time yet,
and wage and other costs remain
on the up-grade. Brightest spot
in the outlook is the new 15-
year meat agreement between
the U.K. and Australian Gov-
ernments. Its chief advantage is
an assured market for Australia’s
surplus meat production ; the
base price is low compared with
the current level in world
markets.
Investors sum up the risks by
pricing the £1 prefs. at 31s. 9d.

Pioneer Scheelite N.L., which
left the stocks at Adelaide in
October last to take over
Imperial Gold’s tungsten leases
at Hatches Creek, Centralia, has
not allowed the grass to grow
under its feet. The mine has
been dewatered and the 88ft.
level, where more ore has shown
up than was expected, is being
prepared for immediate sloping.
A start will presently be made
to sink the McArthur (main)
shaft to 235 ft., from where it is
intended to cross-cut to and then
drive along Nos. 1 and 2 lodes.
Ore won in the process is ex-
pected to more than pay for the
cost of this development. The
target is the tungsten ore dis-
closed by diamond-drilling down
to 300 ft. ; what lies below this
depth has yet to be proved.
Meanwhile, erection of the
powerhouse and 500-ton-a-
-month mill, which the board
claims will be the best north of
Adelaide, is proceeding ; but it is
not expected that full-scale pro-
duction, from which a profit of
£3O a ton is anticipated, will be
reached much before the end of
1952. By that time it is hoped
that development will have put
blocked-ore well ahead of the
mill.

Eldorado Tennant Creek,
Ltd., one of the most successful
gold-producers operating on the
east-west line of lode south of
Tennant Creek, got its conveyor-
belt for transfer of rich dump
residues to the cyaniding vats
into commission a couple of
months ago, and satisfactory re-
coveries of the metal are re-
ported. An attempt to pump
these tailings to the vats proved
unsatisfactory, owing to their
high-specific-gravity and there-
fore quick-settling characteristics.
As it is expected to handle about
60 tons of material daily, profits
should receive a nice lift. Drill-
ing results to-date suggest that
the two anomalies disclosed by
geophysical prospecting are of
doubtful value. For the year to
June 30 last the co. paid a ls.3d.
div. (62| p.c.), making total pay-
ments over the last eight years
Bs. per 2s. share. The market
prices the scrip at 11s. as against
12s. 9d. at end 1951.

King Island Scheelite (1947),
Ltd., is to spend £300,000 out of
the current year’s profits on a
new Marcy-type mill and 18 new
tables. The aim is to raise total
mill throughput of ore from
3000 tons to 4500 tons a week.
A drilling campaign to prove the
extension of the main ore-body
is also to be undertaken at an
early date.

An encouraging feature of
recent developments at Central
Norseman Gold Corp., N.L.,
which is working the Phoenix,
Princess Royal and Lady Miller
mines at Norseman (W.A.), is the
high values being met with at
depth. Recent developments
show that on No. 27 level,
Regent shaft —it is down about
3000 ft., with the reef close below
the footwall —a rise passed
through 28ft. of ore assaying
23.5dwt, width 61in., and some
19dwt. stuff, width 74in., has
shown up in a winze. Also,
values ranging from 15dwt. to
29.5dwt. over widths of 64in. and
48in. have been disclosed by
other development work in the
same area. In the Royal shaft,
No. 6 level, values averaging
42.8dwt. were struck in the
south drive for a distance of
56ft., while some 28.7dwt, ore
has been disclosed in the north
drive over a width of 87in. It
is too early yet to say what
tonnage recent developments are
likely to add to ore reserves, or
the extent to which the assay
value of run-of-mine ore will be
strengthened. Ore reserves at
March 27, 1951, were put at
295,000 tons, averaging 7.4dwt.
The co. has pegged a lot of
new ground north of its present
holdings, and plant capacity is
being stepped up from 150,000
tons to 200,000 tons p.a.

Kalgoorlie Southern Gold
Mines N.L., the strongly-backed
prospecting co. which is drilling
to test the possible southern
extension of the Kalgoorlie
Golden Mile (W.A.) ore-bodies,
has put down one hole to a
depth of 3634 ft. Between 2012 ft.
and 2237 ft. core assays dis-
closed values of from 2.7dwt. to
10.8dwt. Beyond indicating the
existence of gold mineralisation,
the results are not considered to
be of particular significance.
The co., which planned to spend
£150,000 on the campaign, ex-
pected to intersect the lodes
somewhere below 1000 ft. Dis-
covery of payable ore-bodies in
this area would have an im-
portant effect upon the future of
Westralia as a gold-producer.
Gold Mines of Kalgoorlie,
Western Mining Corp. and the
big cos. at the Barrier (N.S.W.)
are the prospecting co.’s
principal financial backers.

A Hair of the Dog?
With Tooth shares at 685.,
A.C.I. at 455., Edwards Dunlop
at 535., Burns Philp 625., Brad-
ford Cotton 30s. 6d., Bank of
N. S. Wales £37 10s. and Drug
Houses at 375. 6d., those suffer-
ing from the after-effects of pre-
vious overspeculation might
consider indulging in a hair of
the dog that bit them. That is
provided that they possess the
wherewithal to buy the hair of
the animal.
Share prices in many cases are
now very low indeed. Those who
bought Bank of N.S.W. last year
at £52 can now average at
£37 10s. And Bradford Cottons
at around 505., ex rights, com-
pare with 30s. 6d. now. The
lowest price for Tooth scrip in
1951 was 80s., the highest 1245.;
today it is 68s. R. B. Davies
Industries last year sold as high
as 465. 9d.; they can now be
picked up at 30s.
It is always difficult to fore-
cast the trend of a sharemarket.
Australian investors and
speculators are an impression-
able lot, and it is easier to sell
them something dear than it is
to persuade them to buy it
cheap. That is a characteristic
not peculiar to Australia. When
prices are booming everyone
wants to be “in it”; when
markets crack there is a
scramble to get out. Yet it is
when prices are low that the
genuine investor is able to get his
highest income reward. That is,
of course, provided profits and
dividends are standing up to any
concurrent setback in trade.
It doesn’t seem to mean a
thing to this sharemarket that a
company may have maintained
its interim dividend. Bradford
Cotton declared an unchanged
rate at the year’s half-way mark,
and yet it is one of the weakest
high-class stocks on the share-
list. F. J. Walker, Frederic Ash,
Ford Sherington and Cyclops
have received little extra sup-
port by reason of their steady
performances in the dividend-
list.
Which seems to suggest that
the sharemarket is a great deal
groggier than industry itself is.
Speculation is undergoing its
first real purge of the past
decade. Wherever there is a
large parcel of scrip for forced
sale there is bound to be a sag
in prices for that stock. The
sharemarket as a whole has a
very weak stomach indeed, and
its eyes are rather bleary as
well.
Forced selling is occurring as
a result of several factors.
“Carried” investors are being
told to settle their accounts in
many cases, and banks are re-
ducing overdrafts. Income-tax
assessments are falling due, and
shares are being sold to meet
them. Probate duty, in the case
of estates, is also causing some
forced sales.
The Government’s credit-
restriction policy, of course, is
affecting investors as well as in-
dustry. Many people who had
put all their savings into shares
have been endeavoring to con-
vert portion of them into a cash
balance in view of probable
difficulties in raising money in
the case of an emergency.
Others who already have a cash
balance are reluctant to put that
cash into shares at present for
the same reason. A number of
people, in short, are prepared to
let investment opportunities and
comparatively high income-
yields pass them by in order to
have the peace of mind that a
spare few hundreds in cash is
believed to give them.
Taking a long-range view,
however, it would not be wise
to count on deflation restoring
a great deal of value to the
pound. It is extremely unlikely
that, in the best of circum-
stances, the level of costs and
internal prices will be better
than stabilised at present levels.
And that is assuming the pre-
sent Western Nations’ effort to
crack inflation, including the
various measures introduced by
“I’m finding it increasingly difficult, sir, to uphold the
dignity of the firm.”
the Menzies Government, is in
the end successful.
It is necessary, therefore, to
reconsider the prospects of indus-
trial ordinary shares as retainers
of value in a period of fluctuat-
ing economic fortunes. Much will
depend upon the shape of world
affairs to come, including the
question of whether we are to
have a third world war or not.
Another will depend upon
whether the cost of the Welfare
State is to continue weighing so
heavily upon industry through
price-control and taxation.
There is, without question, an
immense amount of work
ahead of essential industry in
Australia ; it is just a question
of whether, as a people and as
a Government, as employees and
employers, we can get together
and work diligently and equit-
ably towards a common goal.
Over the past 10 years it has been
a fact that major industry in
Australia has not been permitted
to make enough profit to
encourage and finance the
development that this country’s
growing population is crying
out for.
The high wool prices and high
export income that Australia re-
ceived over the past three years
were in many respects a delusion
and a snare. We paid very high
prices for imported goods as well
as receiving high prices for ex-
ports, and our apparently large
London bank balance has
quickly run down to less than
half. Now, with imports re-
stricted and pastoral incomes
down, we have to make a new
approach to our economic
problems. Industry has to cater
more selectively for real needs.
More productive work per man-
hour is essential. We shall have
to produce a great deal more for
ourselves if we are not to suffer
a severe fall in our standard of
living.
Many share prices were a
good deal too high during the
boom period of 1951, especially
having regard to the yields offer-
ing from them. Some readjust-
ment was very necessary. But
the market in many places has
now gone just as far the other
way. Bradford Cotton yielding
6.5 p.c., John McGrath 6.9 p.c.,
Taubman’s 5.4 p.c., Associated
Leathers 6 p.c., R. B. Davies
5.3 p.c., F. J. Walker 6.1 p.c,, and
Frederic Ash 6.6 p.c. seem
especially attractive in the pre-
sent rocky market. Almost any
good-class stock that is making
a new issue, or has just made
one, is exceptionally depressed
in present conditions of tight
money. How long the existing
state of shaking-out will con-
tinue it is hard to say, and it is
equally difficult to say what the
bottom price for any particular
stock will be. But one thing
is obvious—good shares are
vastly cheaper than they were
six months ago. Only wool
appears to have taken a bump
equal in proportion to the slump
in share prices.
Patons and Baldwins
The sharemarket was shocked
last week by the announcement
from Patons and Baldwins that
the half-yearly preference
dividend, due on April 30, would
not be paid until after the trad-
ing results for the year had been
ascertained. The ord. shares,
which had been up to 40s. soon
after flotation last year, and
which were around 355. for some
months, fell from 255. to below
par in Sydney last Thursday.
Because of the absence of
visible reserves (in view of the
company’s very recent forma-
tion), and the possibility of an
overall loss for the year which
will end on May 3 as a result of
the drop in raw wool prices and
the continued unsettled state of
the wool market, the board has
adopted the dividend policy just
announced.
In its last complete trading
year the co. earned 16 p.c. on
ord. capital, and it valued wool
stocks (£3,377,103) on April 30,
1951, when wool prices had
already fallen by from 25 p.c.
to 30 p.c. on the peak reached
in March. Then, in November,
when wool prices were at a
level about half that of March,
and a little up on the September
quotations, an interim report
said that “steady and satisfactory
business had been transacted
during the first six months of
the year.” Wool prices have
fluctuated since, but most of the
fall occurred in the first half of
1951.
The prospectus indicated that
the co, had large internal re-
serves in its fixed assets, and
shareholders came into the com-
pany on a very satisfactory basis.
The co. is probably wise in
adopting the attitude towards
dividends that it has ; possibly
no other course was open to
prudent businessmen in view of
the absence of accumulated
profits. If a loss on raw wool is
experienced it should be mostly
in respect of stocks bought prior
to September last, and any
further fall in wool prices should
not cause losses on a similar
scale.
The sharemarket appears to
have placed the worst interpreta-
tion on the announcement made
by the board last week. The
ord. shares recovered to 225. 6d.
later.
Sydney share-punters are
wondering what the future of
J. E. Austin and Sons, Ltd.
(Hoxton Park underfelt manu-
facturers), holds. The shares
have come a cropper in the
market, though recently the co.
managed to raise £102,500 of
new capital, which it couldn’t
do today. Listed last year, the
co. paid 12| p.c. for 1950-51 out
of profits which were shown at
26 p.c. on capital. Of the present
paid capital of £255,000,
£155,000 has been put up by the
public over the last 12 months.

CITY ELECTRIC LIGHT
COMPANY LIMITED
[lncorporated in Queensland]
ADDRESS OF CHAIRMAN, MR. J. H. HOLMES
To the SHAREHOLDERS OF CITY ELECTRIC LIGHT COMPANY LIMITED,
at the Fifty-sixth Ordinary General Meeting of the Company held at the Registered
Office of the Company, 156-166 Boundary Street, Brisbane, on 31st March, 1952.
Ladies and Gentlemen:
I now have the honour of presenting to you at this,
the Fifty-sixth Ordinary General Meeting of the Com-
pany, the report of your Directors and the Profit and
Loss Account and Balance Sheet for the year ended
31st January, 1952.
The results will be clear to you from the Report
and the Financial Statements for the year. In view of
the rapid rate at which we have expanded, continuing
shortages of essential materials and continually rising
costs, I think that you will agree that these results
can be regarded as very satisfactory.
EXPANSION:
On the 31st January, 1939, the commencing date of
the present franchise, your Company’s assets were less
than £2,800,000. Since then they have increased to
over £17,000,000. Last year alone they increased by
more than £4,350,000. These figures will give you an
idea of how rapidly we are expanding our undertaking
and how large the undertaking controlled by your
Directors has become,
RENEWAL OF FRANCHISE AGREEMENT:
Under the Company’s Franchise Agreement the
Queensland Government can first exercise its option ot
purchase on the Ist February, 1954, and has an annual
right of purchase thereafter. It would be quite
impossible to carry on this undertaking subject to an
annual right of purchase. The time has now arrived
when it is essential that a decision be arrived at on
the future of the Company.
The Franchise Agreement has succeeded beyond any
reasonable anticipations, and we have carried out all
of our promises to the Government.
I know of no reason why the Government should
exercise its right of purchase.
We have requested the Government to extend the
company’s Franchise Agreement for a period
of 15 years. Our request is under consideration, and
I trust that an early decision will be given so that we
may plan with confidence for the future.
CAPITAL RAISED:
The issue of 1,328,945 new shares was fully sub-
scribed. Few shareholders failed to apply for their
quotas and your Directors were able to allot only a
small percentage of the additional shares applied for
by shareholders.
In May, 1951, we issued a public loan of £6OO,(XX)
at £3/10/-%. At the time it was generally anticipated,
and correctly, that interest rates would rise. In con-
sequence the greater part of the loan had to be taken
up by the underwriters.
On the 31st January last the Company’s first loan
of £500,000, issued in 1941, became due for conversion.
We arranged for the underwriting of a cash and con-
version loan of £600,000 at the same rate of interest,
4i%. It soon became apparent that the loan would
be heavily oversubscribed. Notwithstanding its early
closure the total subscriptions amounted to no less
than £1,400,000.
It is apparent that there are thousands of investors
in Queensland now who are prepared to lend their
money on sound security at current rates of interest.
FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS:
During the forthcoming year we will require both
additional share and debenture capital. We should
have no difficulty in raising this capital.
It is obvious to every thinking man that if Australia
is to overcome current shortages, industry must increase
its output and that this cannot be done unless the
output of electricity is increased rapidly. In these
circumstances one would expect that there would be
no hesitation on the part of the Treasurer in giving
immediate approval to the capital programme of this
Company and its subsidiaries. You will be amazed
to learn that the Capital Issues Board indicated that
it would only be prepared to approve a programme
far below the amounts necessary to enable this Com-
pany to continue to function as an electric authority.
Naturally we protested to the Commonwealth
Treasurer, while the Queensland Government has made
further representations to the Prime Minister. I trust
that there will be no difficulty in our getting permission
to raise the moneys which we must have. If not you
can rely on your Directors to protect the interests of
the Company.
ELECTRICITY RATIONING;
It is now certain that restrictions on the use of
electricity over the next twelve months will have to
be imposed. Qur plant position will not be satisfactory
until the Westinghouse Packaged Power Plant on order
from the United States of America and Bulimba “B”
are both in operation. The Brisbane City Council is
in a considerably worse position. Indeed, if the Bris-
bane City Council had the same proportion of installed
plant in relation to peak loads as we have, there would
be no need for electricity restrictions during the winter
except in the case of temporary breakdowns.
Qur installed plant has a capacity of 92,000 kilowatts,
while the maximum demand at peaks is about same
figure. These peaks will increase during the coming
winter to 100,000 kilowatts and may at times amount
to 105,000 kilowatts. The Brisbane City Council will
have similar peak loads. To meet these loads the
Council has installed plant of only 75,000 kilowatts
as compared with our 92,000 kilowatts.
If the plans recommended by the State Electricity
Commission for spreading the demand for electricity
are carried into effect, the inconvenience which will be
suffered by consumers until our Bulimba “B” Station
comes into operation next year should not be great.
OUR SUBSIDIARIES;
The restrictions which the Commonwealth Govern-
ment has now found it necessary to place upon
imports are due to the fact that Australia is not
producing sufficient primary products and basic
materials which can and should be economically pro-
duced in Australia. This is further confirmation of
your Directors’ wisdom in deciding to embark upon
the development of basic industries.
It is now surely as plain as day, even perhaps to
Canberra, that Australia cannot get out of heT present
difficulties till she increases her production of primary
products, minerals, coal, electricity and power and
the products of heavy industry. These in turn neces-
sarily require the production of adequate building
materials, cement, bricks and timber.
By reason of the restrictions on capital issues we
have been prevented from developing our subsidiaries
along the lines which would produce the best economic
results. I trust that in the coming year the Common-
wealth Government will refrain from further retarding
Australia’s progress by placing obstacles in the way
of the provision of capital for the development of
basic industries.
In spite of handicaps we have made substantial
headway during the year. Our sawmill at Peachester
has commenced operations. The sawmill which we
bought at Landsborough is being modernised and will
soon be in operation. Scott’s Foundry and Engineering
Works at Ipswich have had a successful year. We
have not been able to increase much the capacity of
the existing works although we have improved turn-
over. A new workshop building at present in the
course of construction at Ipswich is intended to be
followed later by the construction of a new foundry.
Orders have been placed for the construction of a
pilot brick plant to supply the immediate requirements
of Queensland Industries Pty. Ltd. and some of the
requirements of this Company. We hope to place
orders for a modern and up to date brick works in
the near future.
When capital issues approve, we can go ahead with
our plans for our subsidiaries.
Queensland Contractors Pty. Ltd. has in hand work
of an aggregate value of £3,000,000. It was a suc-
cessful tenderer for the Tully Falls Hydro Electric
Scheme. It has carried out the construction of
buildings for Queensland Industries Pty. Ltd. and has
been a successful tenderer to this Company for a
number of substations and other works. On earth
drilling it has now 11 machines in operation. Four of
these are doing work for Queensland Industries Pty.
Ltd. and this Company, while 7 are working on other
contracts.
When our subsidiaries’ accounts are made up to the
30th June I hope that Queensland Contractors Pty.
Ltd. will be shown to have made a small profit. There
is a long developmental programme to be carried out
before Queensland Industries Pty. Ltd. reach this stage,
but as to its ultimate success we have no doubts.
QUEENSLAND INDUSTRIES FAIR:
At the Queensland Industries Fair our subsidiaries
will have two very interesting working exhibits. One
will be an amazing machine which is to be used to
produce cross arms. The second will be an earth drill
actually drilling on the showground site.
TRADING DEPARTMENT:
Splendid progress has been made with the expansion
of our trading department, which is already a complete
financial success. I am sure that you have been very
much impressed with our showroom in Cochran House,
Adelaide Street. I cordially invite every shareholder,
stockholder and consumer who has not already
inspected this showroom to do so.
We have established 3 city branches and 10 country
branches and we aim to give as extensive and as
efficient a service as is possible in the supply, installa-
tion and maintenance of electrical appliances and
wiring systems. This is yet another example of the
service which we aim to provide for our consumers.
We are not aiming at any monopoly or near monopoly
in trading in electrical appliances. There is plenty of
room, both for us and for other traders, and the
public will benefit from the competition.
INCREASING COSTS:
We have had to meet very heavy increases in wages
and material costs during the year. Costs continue to
rise at an alarming rate. Rising costs have more than
overcome the effects of the last tariff increase, and it
has been necessary to apply to the Commission for
approval to a further price increase.
THANKS:
I should again like to express our appreciation to
the Queensland Government, to the State Electricity
Commissioner, Mr. Neil Smith, his deputy and officers
for their helpful co-operation during the year.
OUR EMPLOYEES;
I should also again like to express your Directors'
appreciation of the loyal service of your Company’s
employees who have, as always, done their utmost to
maintain the efficiency of your Company’s service.
STANDARD DIVIDEND FOR CURRENT YEAR:
For the year just ended the standard dividend is
payable at the rate of £5/2/6%. For the current year
this dividend will be increased to 5i%. The first pay-
ment at the increased rate will be for the interim
dividend payable in September next.
The Jenkinses of Berkeley.
By GLADYS ATKINSON.
[Wriling from her home at Springfield, near Wollongong, in
April, 1877, Rachel Henning, whose “Letters” were recently
published in The Bulletin, said: “There is only one family down
here we are at all intimate with, and they cure the Jenkinses, of
Berkeley. Mrs. Jenkins died about a year ago, but old Mr, Jenkins
and the sons and daughters are great allies of Mr. Taylor’s and
mine. We exchange visits about, once a week, and sometimes go
for rides and excursions on Lake Illawarra with them.” This
reference has aroused a great deal of curiosity about the Jenkins
family and their history. This article, written by a granddaughter
of William Warren Jenkins —the “old Mr. Jenkins” of Rachel
Henning’s letters —tells something of a family that has many
branches in Australia.]
ROBERT JENKINS arrived
in Sydney in 1808. He
came out as representa-
tive of Messrs. Wilson
Bros., of London, who, during
the great commercial crisis in
England, became bankrupt. He
started business on his own in
Sydney and accumulated con-
siderable property. He was a
highly-educated man. On several
occasions, in 1813 and 1816, he
was a member of the Court of
Civil Jurisdiction, and, on the
formation of the Bank of N. S.
Wales in February, 1817, was
elected one of the board of seven
directors.
On January 24, 1817, he was
granted 1000 acres of land at
Illawarra, which he named
Berkeley. This estate was en-
larged by his widow by a pur-
chase grant of 2000 acres, under
a special warrant dated May,
1825. The combined area was
used for agricultural purposes.
I have a personal letter Robert
Jenkins wrote home to his
mother and sisters in 1812, ex-
plaining many of his interests
here, and telling of his courting
of the young widow of Captain
Austin Forrest. This lady was
Jemima, third daughter of
Robert Pitt and Mary Pitt. I
also have several original letters
Mary Pitt wrote, in 1801, to her
first cousin, George Matcham,
whose wife was Lord Nelson’s
sister, Catherine.
Mary Pitt’s husband had left
her badly off, having spent three
small fortunes. He was of the
family of Sir Morton Pitt, of
Dorset, a younger branch of
Lord Pitt-Rivers’s family.
Mary was much concerned
for the future of her family,
and appealed to her cousin
George Matcham for advice.
He, with the help of Lord
Nelson, advised her to go
to Australia, and made all
arrangements for the trip.
She arrived here in 1801 with
four daughters and one son,
with letters of introduction to
Governor King. They stayed at
Government House until accom-
modation was found for therm
They all, including Mary, re-’
ceived grants of land.
Robert Jenkins married
Jemima on March 22, 1813, at
St. John’s, Parramatta, and lived
at Eagle Vale, Campbell Town,
They had two sons, Robert
Pitt Jenkins (who was drowned
with his wife and five sons in
the wreck of the Royal Charter
on the coast of Wales on October
26, 1859), and William Warren
Jenkins. Unfortunately Robert
Jenkins, snr., was killed in an
accident on May 22, 1822.
William Warren Jenkins, born
July 11, 1816, at Sydney, married
his first-cousin, Matilda Pitt
Wilshire, fourth daughter of
James Wilshire, on July 11, 1838,
at St. James’, King-street. I
have a letter he wrote to his
young wife addressed to Eagle
Vale dated November 14, 1838.
He was on a trip to the Murrum-
bidgee River, The letter is
sincerely affectionate, and hap-
pily all their lives their letters
to each other were so. Wra.
Warren Jenkins and his wife had
10 children ; nine survived.
Berkeley House, near Lake
Illawarra, was built about 1840 ;
Edmound Blacket was the archi-
tect. I know that Matilda
Jemima Jenkins, Wm. Warren
Jenkins’s eldest daughter, was
bom at Berkeley in March, 1842.
Because I am a granddaughter
of Wm. Warren Jenkins,
daughter of Alfred Matcham
Jenkins, the youngest and most
spoilt son of the house of
Berkeley, I was greatly interested
in Rachel Henning’s mention of
my people. Her husband,
Deighton Taylor, was so well
thought of by my grandfather
that he made him one of his
trustees, and my cousin. Miss E,
King (Louisa Jenkins’s daughter)
of Collaroy, well remembers
Rachel in her lovely garden.
My mother was a daughter of
Alfred Waldron, of Spring Hill,
a property adjoining Berkeley,
where Captain Waldron settled
in 1832. Unfortunately the
marriage was unblessed by either
house and broke up when I was
too young to remember my
father, and when my sister, now
Mrs. D. L. Gordon, of
Armidale, was an infant.
My mother, in 1899, married
W. Lister Lister, the artist and
the finest man I ever knew. Yet
I am much a Jenkins, and my
favorite aunt, Matilda Jemima
Jenkins (“Aunt Mimy” to us all),
spoke often of old Berkeley and
the splendors of the past.
The old Jenkinses were fine
people. I have many souvenirs
from Berkeley House, left to me
by my aunt. Many old letters
and papers, the most valuable
being the original document
signed by Governor Sir Charles
Augustus Fitz-Roy on July 29,
1851, making William Warren
Jenkins warden of Illawarra.
There is a trophy inscribed
and presented to “Miss Jen-
kins of Berkeley on the
occasion of her laying the
foundation-stone of the Albert
Memorial Hospital, Wollongong,
June 25, 1863,” while the
handsome gilt clock in its
original glass-case presented to
“Mr. and Mrs. W. Warren
Jenkins on the occasion of the
28th anniversary of their wed-
ding,” still keeps perfect time
for me.
The Berkeley cemetery was
an acre given by my grandfather
as a site for a church. From a
letter written by my Aunt Mimy
I quote: “It was given as a
site for a church, the late Mr.
Jenkins himself collected sub-
scriptions, and had the building
erected, which has since been
removed” (1877) .... “Dean
Cowper, in the absence of
Bishop Barker, opened the
church for divine service.”
.... “The ground was never
consecrated but it was meant
for a private resting-place for
Mr. Jenkins’s family as well as
a site for a church”....
William Warren Jenkins’s
father and mother were removed
from the Devonshirq-street
cemetery to Berkeley in 1901,
and no Jenkins belonging
to the family was buried
anywhere else in Wollongong.
Miss Matilda Jemima (Aunt
Mimy), the eldest daughter of
the house, died in April, 1942,
aged 100 years, and hers was
our last family funeral. The
service in St. Michael’s Church,
Wollongong, the church her
father had done much for in the
early days, and where they had all
worshipped together, was most
impressive. The late Canon
W. H. A. Barder, a close friend
of the old lady’s, came down
with us to officiate, and he in-
vited Mr. Long, the Rector of
St. Michael’s, and my cousin, the
Rev. C. B. McCarthy, to assist.
When the old home broke up
and Robert Jenkins and his wife
Agnes, daughter of the Rev.
Campbell Ewing, of Wollon-
gong, with their son, R. J.
Jenkins, and daughter Grace, the
late Mrs. Cecil Blomfield, took
up residence as the owner, the
two unmarried sisters, Miss
M.J. and Elinor Warren Jenkins,
decided to live in Rose Bay,
Sydney, and later in Vaucluse,
where they became almost as
well known as they had been at
Berkeley.
In conclusion, to those of our
fourth, fifth and sixth genera-
tions now living, to the Pitts,
Wilshires, Faithfulls, Woods and
many others whose common
ancestor was Mary Pitt, no
greater fortune could be theirs
than to have inherited something
of her humble, indomitable
courage.

A BIT OF A MIX UP
by ETHEL ANDERSON
FAIRY - MARTINS had
built their nests on the
ferry. Quite a colony of
them was established under
the deck ledge of that contrap-
tion of wire and cedarwood
which, just above Doggett’s
Patch, plied across the
Lanterloo.
The wide, deep river was to-
day in flood, but in any case it
was almost always yellow with
mud and rucked-up into wave-
lets that were backed with
orange even in a morning light.
Ideas clothed in feathers
rather than birds of flesh and
blood, the twittering martins
flitted over the swiftly-flowing
Lanterloo on such intangible
wings that they had, in their still
swifter flight, the substance,
merely, of butterflies or moths,
yet their moist and polished
iridescences of rusty red
brightened the river’s buff tints
a tone or two, and thus seemed
to relate them more intimately
to the ripples below them than
to their own colorless element,
the air; the water’s beauty was
burnished by their übiquitous
wings.
Tenants of the ferry, they gave
themselves the airs of owners;
they would thread their way
almost invisibly between the
horses and vehicles on the punt,
or dart about the heads of the
standing passengers as pertly as
if they resented infringements of
rights so palpably their own.
Just there seldom used, the
ferry might stand idle for weeks,
its tip resting on the clayey
ramp. It had been this
immobility one spring day many
years back which had led the
pioneer martins to mistake it for
a bridge; their nests were
already chirping when, to their
astonishment, the pontoon had
groaned and whirred, jangled
and clanked its way across the
turbulent stream to the opposite
bank ; attended by how furious
a flight of parents!
On this particular spring
morning, accustomed to their
domicile’s mobility, the birds
accompanied the ferry much as
doves and sparrows are shown
to circle round the Chariot of
Love in some classical design ;
the air was full of the scent of
pear-blossom from the orchard
that abutted on the track on the
far side of the river; the sun
shone, the deep-dyed Lanterloo
purred and purled in the inter-
minable pattern (make one, drop
one, knit two together) of its
wavelets ; and there was abso-
lutely no reason why anyone
should not be glad to be alive;
the fairy-martins plainly re-
joiced ; and the very beautiful
young lady, seated in the white
basket-work phaeton behind two
dashing cream Arabs, evidently
shared the general glory of the
earth and sky with them, for
her face wore a most alluring
expression of content as she
waited, at ease among her red-
and-white-striped cushions and
curtains, her “tiger” in his seat
behind her.
She was utterly enchanting,
yes, she was; and to those who
watched for it, her equipage
grew daily smarter; the two
cream ponies (whose flowing
tails almost touched the ground)
now wore straw hats (with ear-
holes) bound with red, a rose
adorning each, the “tiger” (as
such boyish grooms are called)
had also a rose. Truth to tell
Babette D’Entrecasteaux, her
Excellency Lady Willing-Toper’s
“French” maid, had once been
charmed by a lady who had
driven just such another turnout
as her own through the Champs-
Elysees ; she was her model, her
ideal; and an indulgent mistress
humored her fancies. For
Babette was the only woman she
had ever had who really under-
stood her toupee.
"THE tall young man who ran
A the ferry, bronzed and
bearded and limping a little, for
he had lately returned from the
Crimean War, wounded, left his
cuddy, his wheelhouse, the
shelter where, secure from the
weather, he turned and turned
and turned the winch that drew
in or let but the twisted copper-
cables that bridged the river, and
along which the punt wallowed
its loopy way, and went to offer
his help in getting the two ponies
to face the awkward boarding of
the tip; but another vehicle, a
very smart “Hyde Park,” drawn
by a pair of bays, and driven by
a cockaded coachman attired in
a uniform of mustard and green
(as was the groom seated beside
him), had trotted briskly up;
Dr. Boisragon, from Parra-
matta, looking very handsome —
in the manner of the earlier
Roman Emperors—though still
in deep mourning for a wife two
months’ dead, sprang out and
took charge of affairs.
“We have met before, dear
lady!” Dr. Boisragon exclaimed
joyfully, standing hat in hand
beside the phaeton. “On the
day of his Excellency’s arrival
in Sydney, when you landed on
the wharf at Hunter’s Hill.”
“A boat from the Surinam
Merchant, in which I had
travelled from Madras, had
brought me there.”
“And your delightful carriage
was there to meet you! I had
the good fortune to restore to
you the fan you had dropped!”
“Indeed, Monsieur, X re-
member pairfectly! It is a fan
I cherish.”
Dr. Boisragon pulled down his
black waistcoat and looked even
more handsome. He became
protective.
“Is it safe. Mademoiselle, for
one so lovely to journey
unattended in this remote
neighborhood? There are rough
characters about.”
“I haff my leefle groom and
my wheep.”
The “tiger,” by this, had left
his perch behind the red-and-
white-striped awning of the
phaeton and gone to hold the
horses’ heads. He was small for
his age (twelve); to be a jockey,
to ride races in Hyde Park, or
along the Parramatta-road —
that was his tremulous ambition!
“As white as a snowflake!”
Dr. Boisragon tenderly
regarded the hand that held the
carriage whip. He noticed with
relief that its fellow was defaced
by no wedding-ring, and leaning
gracefully across the basket-work
shielding the wheel, he ventured
on a conversation.
“The ship?” . . . “Her
journey! How privileged the
sailors!” . . . “India, land of
spice, the coral strand —how
blessed the land! Her birth-
place?” . . . “Her beauty !” .
“Never, in the course of his
whole life, so meaningless until
he met her, had he seen such
loveliness, such?” . . .
The colloquy, though the
lady responded merely by
dazzling smiles, or down-bent
eyes, proceeded along the usual
lines.
Meanwhile the loose-
limbed young ferryman
was busy with the “Hyde Park.”
One of those agnostics whose
scepticism appeared to be all-
embracing, the cool appraisal of
his regard had the cynical air
of seeing through all those dis-
guises, those subterfuges, which
veiled the conduct of his fellows ;
and a cold derision was inherent
even in the smile that (so seldom)
displaced the soft thatch of the
chestnut beard to disclose his
white teeth and red, full lips. A
short-shrift-giving character, who
reinforced the edges of
peremptory speech with a brisk
whistle or a snapping finger, he
now, with one of those shrill
bids for a more complete atten-
tion, opened communication with
Dr, Boisragon’s coachman ; and
with various expressive clicks of

Proud of their
Service to
Australia . . .
The family with a man
in the Services can be
justly proud. Fathers,
mothers, wives, sweet-
hearts, brothers, sisters—
all know that their man
in the Navy, Army or
Air Force is serving Aus-
tralia in the finest way
. . . strengthening our
defences at a time when
defence is of critical
importance.
Proud of iheir
place of honour
in the Community ...
The men who join the Ser-
vices merit the honour and
appreciation of every Aus-
tralian. They are the main
safeguard of our freedom
and security. The families
of Servicemen can be proud
of the men who have put
their skill and energy into
the nation’s service.
'
&
Proud to be
Dependants
of a Serviceman!
When a man joins the
Navy, Army or Air Force,
he helps his family in
two ways —by fitting him-
self for their defence if
need be, and by under-
taking a career which
provides excellent pay,
conditions, leave and al-
lowances with oppor-
tunities for advancement,
permanent employment
and pension or gratuity
on early retirement.
More than a job, it's an honourable career
in the Services!
If you want more out of your job than just work and pay,
find out how a career in the Services will satisfy. Whether
you are skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled, there’s an opening

the tongue, sibilant breaths
expelled through shut teeth and
snapping, irritable fingers, got
the Hyde Park past the
phaeton and on to the punt.
The Hyde Park itself was
weeping. Black crepe was tied
over the four carriage lamps.
The whip, upright in its holster,
bore a black bow. Even the bays
had black rosettes on their
bridles. Everyone agreed that
Dr. Boisragon had done the
thing handsomely.
The two menservants, in their
bottle-green livery, with its
mustard facings, their left arms
saddened by crepe, their top-
hats shadowed by bauds similar
to the one that subdued the
brightness of their master’s
“stovepipe,” stood at their
horses’ heads discussing him.
“ ’E’s clean bowled over.”
The coachman indicated Dr.
Boisragon by a gloved thumb.
“Since we met ’er on the
wharf at ’Unter’s ’lll ’e’s gone
a hunner mile out of ’is way
’oping to meet ’er.”
“Too proud to harsk ’oo she
be.”
The men laughed slyly. They
knew.
“We could ’a’ telled ’im.”
“It’s a serious case! ’E sent
’is three childer and their aunties
off to Gander’s Pond.”
“To the tumbledown cottage.
Poor Miss Fragrance Thistle-
dew ! ”
“ ’Er Ma wanted to make a
match for ’er and the Doctor.”
“ ‘The sad hassociations of this
’ere ’ouse,’ the Doctor says to
’is sisters, ‘must depress you
like,’ and ’e bundled ’em out.”
“ ’ls ’ouse is empty for a bride
like.”
With knowing looks at the
fair occupant of the phaeton
who was cutting out, as they
said, Miss Fragrance, the men
laughed again.
Here the ferryman carelessly
touched one of those “forage”-
caps worn by most of the lads
who had returned from the
Crimea ; from the slaughteryards
of Inkermann, Balaclava and
Sevastopol, the Redoubt, the
Sandbag battery; from the
charges of the “Light” or the
“Heavy” Brigade ; action in that
never-to-be-forgotten struggle, in
the defeat of Russia, about
which, getting together in groups,
the returned soldiers talked inter-
minably, as if such sacrifices
mattered; and said briskly,
“Ready, sir, if you’ll be so
good!”
“Oh, carry on. I’ll wait and
escort the lady across.”
“Sorry, sir!” The ferryman
invented a rule, “Owners must
travel with their own convey-
ances.”
“We can’t carry four horses,
certainly not those barbs and the
bays,” he added hurriedly,
anticipating Dr. Boisragon’s next
suggestion.
A scene was to be deprecated.
Dr. Boisragon, with good
grace, bowed his adieux.
“May I not call? Can we
not meet?”
His tone was urgent.
“Helas! ”
A smile dismissed him.
He was given a snowflake.
“I shall live in hopes.”
Gallantly saluting his
fair Incognita yet once
again, Dr. Boisragon took his
place in his Hyde Park. The
ferry groaned and clanked its
way across the yellow river, the
fairy-martins whirring round it,
and, the Hyde Park duly de-
canted on the further shore, it
returned with such celerity that
even the martins were left
lagging behind.
Instead, however, of leading
the perfectly placid Arabs on to
the punt, the limber-limbed,
debonair ferryman leant, as Dr.
Boisragon had done, on the
basket-work splashboards pro-
tecting the wheels of the
phaeton and fixed its delicious
occupant with a cool derisive
stare.
All the fluttering airs and
graces, the demure smiles, the
down-bent glances, the con-
trolled dimples, the whole
armory of her wiles, dropped
(together with the “French”
accent) from the lady as she
greeted him ; a hard stare, equal-
ling his own in its impersonal
intensity, met the ferryman’s
unwavering gaze.
That mysterious charmer
Mademoiselle Babette D’Entre-
casteaux became, in one instant,
a girl of his own class; she
knew instinctively that, as far as
this admirer was concerned, their
love affair was to be a fight, with
the gloves off ; he was not to be
kept at bay by guile.
Still meeting his teasing eyes,
that looked even more blue than
usual backed by the yellow river,
Babette stretched out two
fingers and, fishing in the breast-
pocket of his open shirt, she
brought out a packet of conver-
sation lollies; in those regions
and in such circles the badge,
it might be called, of the court-
ing male. The derisive smile
with which he had waited for
this manoeuvre, though hardly
softened, became slightly
triumphant as he put his own
large hand over her white
morsel —the snowflake of Dr.
Boisragon’s compliment and
took out a sweetie.
“Read that,” he commanded.
“Kiss me harder, dear,” Miss
D’Entrecasteaux read, her dark
eyes, devoid of expression, fixed
on his.
Such was the legend, as the
ferryman perfectly well knew,
that was inscribed in red letters
on the pink disk.
The ferryman took off his
lady’s coalscuttle bonnet (of
green velvet, shirred .and lined
with a coronet of moss-rose
buds), and put it on the seat
beside her; then kiss her he
did, quite oblivious of the wide-
eyed “tiger,” the flitting
martins or the pink pinafore
which was hanging out clothes
on a line further down the river.
This task done, and done in a
manner v/ith which even the
inventor of the conversations on
the lollies could have found no
fault, the tall young ferryman
took the paper-bag and bestowed
it in his pocket with a com-
placent smile.
Stepping back, Babette’s
brusque admirer whistled to the
“tiger” to lead the ponies on to
the ferry, just stopping as they
went off to give his lady-love
two peremptory taps on the
shoulder and say coolly “Meet
me by the church clock in
Parramatta at eight tonight, and
don’t be late this time. You are
not to keep me waiting—
understand?”
“I couldn’t help it, Willy,”.
Mademoiselle D’Entrecasteaux
said in a gentle, humble tone.
“My lady kept me.”
As she tied on her flighty
bonnet she thought “He talks
to me exactly as he talks to his
horse op his dog,” and her heart
beat happily and proudly. She
was very young.
Edging himself back into his
box the derisive youth turned
and turned and turned his winch,
whistling meanwhile, with
coloratura variations, the
popular tune;
When Cardigan the Fearless
His name immortal made
He charged the Russian army
With the gallant {tweet, tweet,
tweet) Li-ight Bri-i-gade.
The punt slapped and stag-
gered its way across the surging
river, the martins joyously
escorting it, until the other bank
was reached, then the tempestu-
ously flowing waters, that made
so wide a setting for the minute
cottages, the high-perched inn
(the “Devil’s Tail”) at Doggett’s
Patch were left behind; the
phaeton vanished out of sight.
OUT of sight, but not, in
many cases, out of mind!
Not only did the ferryman
brood on the image of its fair
driver, not only did Dr. Bois-
ragon trotting hither and thither
on his rounds attempt, in vain,
to brush her image from his
heart, but at Government House,
where, in due course, Babette
turned in (at the stable door),
two equally distinguished
admirers were thinking of her.
His Excellency, as he waited
on the front steps for his
carriage, was wondering whose
kiss it was that had been pressed
on his hand as it slipped down
the banisters on his descending
the stairs that day? Had he
been mistaken for someone else?
Was the unseen trespasser
Babette! Or was it only
Harriet, the second housemaid?
He pondered, a smile on his lips.
In the servants’ hall, too,
where the midday meal (an
unheard-of thing) had been kept
back for her ten minutes,
Babette’s breathless entry caused
a stir.
The circle round the table,
seated in its customary ranks,
included the cook (at the foot),
the butler (at the head) and,
ranged round them, the four
footmen, the five or six house-
and parlor-maids, the sewing-
maid and other upper-servants,
who were being waited upon by
those of lesser degree; several
kitchen-maids and vegetable-
girls, pantrymen. Boots and
Buttons. Besides his Excellency’s
valet, there were several visitors,
too, at the high table.
As he pulled out her chair
(next his own) for her, the butler
asked, with jealous eyes, “Are
we to have the honor of know-
ing, Mademoiselle, where your
morning has been spent?”
“Indeed, yes! I drove to
Doggett’s Patch!”
“For the tenth time in a
fortnight. And tomorrow?
Doggett’s Patch again?”
The butler carved the roast.
“Oh, no, Mr. Ponting! To-
morrow I go to Gander’s Pond.
Miss Fragrance has promised to
show me the new way to whip
net.”
The butler was so good-
looking, so well-groomed, and
had so important an air that, in
London, he had frequently been

mistaken for a duke, and even
Cupid had so far respected his
dignity. But now, Oh! Sorrow!
Sorrow! Mr. Ponting had found
himself to be but mortal! He
was aware that, where
Mademoiselle D’Entrecasteaux
was concerned, he was behaving
like a fifth footman! Yes,
indeed! All that he had deter-
mined upon, in bestowing his
heart, when the right moment
came to dislodge it from so
immaculate a bosom, he had
thrown by the board! He was
in love. He contemplated mak-
ing a mesalliance! What?
Marry a “French” maid? He
had tried to fight his passion,
but, oh! The flesh was weak!
Tonight, to see the engaging little
creature come rustling in, almost
rosy from her drive, her glorious
eyes alight, her voice seductive
with undertones of greater rich-
ness than ever before! Oh! Oh!
Oh! Inevitably he would have
made a “declaration,” except for
one thing ; that was the presence
ip Government House of the
Duke of Dustboreham (pro-
nounced Duttum ) himself.
(And the Duke had come on
very peculiar business ; very.)
Their august presence (natur-
ally) being felt to be a brake on
the inborn gaiety of the lower
servants, below-stairs etiquette
dictated that, after the first
course had been served, the
butler, the cook and the ladies’
maid should withdraw, to par-
take of the “sweet” course in the
housekeeper’s room ; where that
lady joined them at table. They
were waited upon, of course, by
other servants, who would
presently eat a scratchy meal in
the kitchen among a perfect
marathon of dirty dishes.
The housekeeper’s room was
cosy.
It was the repository of all the
Empire furniture recently dis-
carded by Lady Willing-Toper,
and formerly treasured by her
predecessor. Lady Mary. The
present Governor’s wife had
introduced the new mid-
Victorian mode; the curate, the
stand that held three tiers of
cakes; the conversational sofa,
shaped like an S; the daisy-
pickers’ sociable, on which six
people sat back to back, without
hny possibility of addressing one
another. For, just as the previous
Governor’s wife had banished
her predecessor’s (the first
wife’s) things, the “Gothic”
trifles in the Strawberry Hill
manner, so had the next vice-
reine bundled out the “hideous”
Hepplewhite and Sheraton chairs
she had installed; and in due
rotation her own late-Georgian
“rubbish” was discarded to make
way for early-Victorian “coy”
pieces; chairs just wide enough
not to hold two people, and so
on. The housekeeper’s room was
the museum which housed many
of these treasures.
In this maroon retreat, then,
the butler had, for the past two
months, been growing more daily
subject to Babette’s spell. It was
here that the housekeeper, Mrs.
Perks, the cook, Mrs. Greenhill,
the butler and Babette gossiped
in the most delicious intimacy,
and discussed from every angle
the Duke’s activities.
CT VERY morning at ten
*—' o’clock the Duke would
stroll into the A.D.C.’s room and
seat himself at the desk which
had hitherto tabled nothing
more important than invitations.
His secretary and the solicitor
who had accompanied him out
from England would produce
immense ledgers, and work
would commence.
The ten or twelve men or
women, or both, who each day
had waited in the ante-room,
shyly and silently, but regarding
each other with a concentrated
curiosity, would be singly intro-
duced into the Duke’s presence ;
pens would fly; money would
clink ; oaths would be taken.
His Grace, in fact, was
straightening out a tangle left
him by his father, the twelfth
Duke. He was interviewing
those members of his family
who had been born, as they say,
on the wrong side of the blanket.
The Duke was verifying their
claims.
He was also disabusing the
mothers of these children of the
idea that jumping over a broom-
stick, when the moon was full,
even when in company with a
Duke, constituted a legal form
of marriage. (The late Duke had
been of a whimsical turn of
humor.)
It had been the twelfth Duke’s
grand-seignorial habit to dispatch
to the colonies such contribu-
tions as he had made to the
human race. Very properly, he
had been most generous in his
provision for them. He endowed
them, not only for the first
generation, in which he had
taken so beneficent (if casual) a
hand; but he had made pro-
vision even to the fourth and
fifth generations; he would
never have it said that the Dust-
boreham (Outturn) nose was to
be met with in the gutter ; even
in an Antipodean gutter.
So his children and their
mothers came out, liberally
endowed, to Port Jackson.
The coterie in the house-
keeper’s room found much to
amuse them in all this. They
laughed gaily at the medley of
vehicles arriving at the “official”
entrance, through which only
the Chief Justice was supposed
to go and come. One lad had
come driving, with a great crack-
ing of a forty-foot cowhide
whip, a wagon-load of wool,
drawn by sixteen bullocks,
which had waited for hours in
the drive and was thought to
have been responsible for an
almost Egyptian plague of flies.
“In he came, that lad,” Mr.
Ponting related, having himself
admitted him, “and shakes
hands with his Grace as bold as
you please. There they were,
the very spit and image of each
other. Even the Duke got a
shock, I could see that.”
“They all have the family
nose, with wide, cut - back
nostrils and a high bridge that
runs up between the eyebrows—
it’s unmistakable!”
Babette, with a finger, was
drawing its shape in the air be-
fore her own lovely nose when
the third footman entered bear-
ing two notes, folded into cocked
hats, that seemed to be sailing
like yachts across the silver tray ;
he presented one to Babette, one
to Mr. Ponting.
No one could fail to see that
they were inscribed in the Duke’s
own generously rambling hand.
A hush fell.
The notes (permission asked
of the housekeeper) were opened
and glanced at.
Mr. Ponting turned white as a
lily.
Babette blushed red as a rose.
“His Grace requests my advice
about a small matter.” Obvi-
ously extemporising, Mr. Pont-
ing, rising hurriedly, left the
room.
Babette, after a few moments
of dazed silence, went dumbly
out.
“They, too!”
“On his Grace's family-list!”
“Babette! Of the Duke’s
kin!”
“And Mr. Ponting?”
The cook told the house-
keeper she would never believe
it. The housekeeper told the
cook she would never believe it.
Meanwhile Mr. Ponting duly
presented himself in the A.D.C.’s
room, extremely dignified and
much alarmed. But dignified ;
oh, yes!
HE found his Grace with the
immense ledger open, as
usual, before him. The last
three names on his list were
plainly to be read.
Dr. (Peter) Boisragon. (Milly
Weaver), £2O.
Ebenezer Ponting (??), £7
(arrears).
Babette D’Entrecasteaux
(Mary Jones), £5 (this month).
Mr. Ponting read these names
rooted to the spot.
The Duke had his own kind
formula for greeting applicants
for his father’s bounty. He rose.
He shook hands heartily. He
said, in a cordial high-pitched
voice, “It’s always a pleasure to
me to meet one of my own kith
and kin. After all, blood is
thicker than water. Do sit
down.”
“Thank you, no!” Mr. Pont-
ing said firmly. “Your Grace is
under a misapprehension. I can
acknowledge no relationship
with the Twelfth Duke.”
“Oh, my dear fellow, come
now!” The Duke pushed the
ledger sideways, so that Mr.
Ponting could read it clearly.
“There is your name as plain as
a pikestaff! You can see it for
yourself. Mr. Peck and Mr.
Pool are still away, lunching out,
but this record is kept with
meticulous care.”
“All the same, your Grace,
my name and Mademoiselle
D’Entrecasteaux’s are certainly
there in error. She was bom in
Madras.”
The Duke realised the delicacy
of the situation.
“My father was Governor
there seventeen or eighteen
years ago.”
His Grace could have no
knowledge of the pain he was
inflicting. Babette his sister!
Mr. Ponting could not credit it.
He refused to believe so bizarre
a tale. Babette —his sister !
In his youth Mr. Ponting had
been personal footman to a
queen. He had been entrusted
with the Royal teapot; the early
cup of tea. He had a poise, a
dignity nothing could shake.
“Your Grace is entirely mis-
taken in both cases. Permit me
to withdraw. The subject is one
I do not even care to discuss,
and I have my work to do.”
Bowing, the butler moved to-
wards the door, which was flung
suddenly open, and Babette
came in.
At all times an alluring sight,
Babette now sparkled like live
lightning, and though she was in
black, her crinoline making a
black blot all about her, both
men had the impression that a
rainbow had suddenly entered ;
she radiated such a glorious
fury.
She took Mr. Ponting’s hand
and faced the Duke; the fatal
entry, as she stood there, was
plainly to be read ; and read it
she did.
“Do you dare to tell me that
I am illegitimate?”
“Oh, my dear young lady,”
the Duke cried, shocked, “do
not put it that way; do not, I
beg of you. I acknowledge you
as a sister (in a way) and I have
come to see that you are not in
want. Pray do not be so easily
affronted! ”
The Duke had the intention,
directly his work was finished,
of going up to his bedroom and
putting his head out of the
window to enjoy a cigar; for
smoking was not allowed in
Government House. He wore,
therefore, his smoking-cap, of
red plush, gathered into a deep
band of crocheted wool. His
smoking-jacket, too, was of red
velvet; frogged with gold
braid. Otherwise he was in
pearl-grey; a grey hardly less
ethereal than his white whiskers,
which, of the pattern known as
“mutton-chops,” had the lustre
of spun glass. His face was
pink, his eyes blue ; his whole
expression kind in the extreme.
His manners, of course, were
delightful.
“My father was riding-master
to the Green Bays in Madras!
Her Excellency knows him! She
can prove that your story is
quite untrue!”
The snowflakes, beloved of
Dr. Boisragon, were lifted high
to heaven.
“I swear it!”
MRS. SIDDONS as Lady
Macbeth, Malibran as
Desdemona, Wilhelm ina
Schroder-Devrient as Leonora,
Pauline Viardot - Garcia as
Orpheus, though (to heighten the
pathos) they would have worn
tights (except, perhaps, Lady
Macbeth), even in their greatest
hour could never have raised
such a tempest of emotion as
Babette did now, pouring out a
torrent of words in an unknown
tongue. She was superb.
The Duke, who had seen the
greatest tragedians of the day,
was spellbound. Mr. Ponting,
who, to the role of butler,
brought the soul of an artist, felt

CAR’S INSIDE STORY
fnend?
what make is his new car? And suddenly you realise you’re not
sure although he’s given you lifts, often.
But you just didn’t notice nice seats, nice smooth engine, nice . . •
And the car itself somehow didn’t tell you any more.
If that car had been a Javelin you’d have noticed.
That effortless acceleration (0-60 in 22-4 secs.) would have had you full of
questions after the first gear change assuming you’re interested in cars.
Soon you would have tempted the driver into sampling some of the
tremendous power that comes from that flat-four engine
a genuine 80 m.p.h. And then you’d look behind and see all that room.
And you’d sense those torsion bars doing what only torsion bars
can do to bumps. And you’d start thinking to yourself—yes, one day
this car’s going to be yours.
The Javelin is famous for its sleek lines but the man or woman
behind the wheel loves it for what it does.
Top speed, electrically timed, 80 m.p.h. Acceleration 0-60 m.p.h.

an extraordinary revolution of
feeling.
“Could, by any chance, this
glorious being be my sister?”
he asked himself with a fast-
beating heart. “My own sister?
A sister? God’s most glorious
creation? And, perhaps, the
least expensive of all human
relationships?”
He pictured himself introduc-
ing her “My sister He pictured
himself leading her up the aisle
—the bride —he, her brother,
was to give away.
To gain Babette as a sister —
would he even acknowledge the
Duke’s untrue aspersion? (For
it was, he could prove, he felt,
untrue.) He debated the point,
his eyes never leaving Babette.
Mr. Ponting had known no
family ties.
“To have Babette as a sister!”
This refrain kept singing through
his heart. A pride! An orna-
ment! And no responsibility,
no expense!
He fell in love with the idea.
Meanwhile both men listened
to the melting tones of Babette’s
oratory. She spoke (but how
could they tell?) in the “Gond”
language which she had used in
childhood. Doubtless she was
eloquent. Certainly she was
supremely beautiful, graceful,
mesmeric, musical. Her hearers
were both enchanted, if be-
wildered.
She had reached, it seemed,
her peroration when the door
again opened and in walked Dr.
Boisragon. The fresh shock
brought Babette to her senses.
She stretched out her hand,
and, pulling him into line with
herself and the entranced Mr.
Ponting, she said, in the tones of
Phaedra, “The Duke says I am
illegitimate. He says you are
illegitimate. He says Mr. Pont-
ing is illegitimate.”
She closed her eyes and threw
back her lovely head.
She resumed. “He says you,
Dr. Boisragon, are my brother!
He says you, Mr, Ponting, are
my brother. Not eligible /”
It was the wail of Saphonisba !
Saphonisba 1 Oh !
Dr. Boisragon was, naturally,
a man of the world, yet he was,
even after two meetings with her
(as one could so easily be), in
love with Babette D’Entre-
casteaux, whose name he did not
even know. He had come, sus-
pecting nothing (for he had
heard nothing of the Duke’s
strange mission), in response to
a message from the A.D.C.:
“Could he step in when
passing?”
He looked at the Duke.
“Would you, my dear Duke,
explain? I am utterly be-
wildered.”
His Grace explained.
Dr. Boisragon examined the
entries in the book. He seemed
less dazed than might have been
expected.
Babette, too, peeping over his
shoulder, had the appearance of
seeing a light.
HERE the A.D.C. entered in
the full-dress uniform of the
Bombay Royal Horse Artillery,
which, it may be remembered,
included a brass helmet hung
with flowing strands of horse-
hair dyed red and white, thigh-
high top-boots over white
breeches and a scarlet, blue-and-
gold coat, behind which hung a
second jacket edged with fur, its
sleeves dangling loose,’ and
various impedimenta in the
shape of a clanking sword, a
sabretache, embroidered in gold
thread, gold aiguillettes and a
tasselled belt. The young man
had been with his Excellency to
open a mothers’-union confer-
ence at Little Peeping, in the
Inlet, and he had been standing
three hours in the sun ; his face
was brick-red, but still had an
almost girlish prettiness, en-
hanced by golden “Dundrearies.”
He was looking for some-
thing, it seemed.
“ Ton my soul,” he exclaimed,
wandering round the room
searching here and there, “her
Ex. came in and asked me to
jot down some housekeeping
expenses; bills to be paid, and
—bless my soul! There they
are I"
He was about to take up the
ledger, which was exactly like
every other ledger, when Mr.
Pool and Mr. Peck, with the
furtive air of men coming back
from a good lunch, entered and
stopped him.
“Not so fast, Captain Fortes-
que - Montmorency - Stammers -
Quint!”
“Hey?”
“That is our ledger!”
“No, no, my account-book!
Bin lookin’ for it everywhere.”
“It is the Duke’s private —
very private —property.”
Examining it more closely, the
A.D.C. began laughing.
“So it is! And I have jotted
down my memo in it and
increased his Grace’s family by
three!”
Mr. Peck and Mr. Pool, the
Duke and Dr. Boisragon were
not amused; but Mr. Ponting
and Babette were; they suffered
excruciating agony in refraining
from laughter, and stood there
looking wooden; not daring to
catch each other’s eye.
The A.D.C.’s sufferings came
from excess of laughter. Finally
he caught Dr. Boisragon by the
shoulder and propelled him
through the door; he had to
give him (by Lady Willing-
Toper’s direction) a cheque for
twenty pounds for attending
“Milly Weaver,” whose name,
since she was the daughter of
one of the gardeners, was not
familiar to the indoor staff.
Babette, however, on saner
reflection, realised that “Mary
Jones” was her own sewing
maid, and due to get five pounds
for some shopping expenses
incurred on her Excellency’s
behalf. The sum entered opposite
Mr. Ponting’s name was his
weekly bill. Just that.
BUT Babette had lost two
admirers.
The mere idea that she might
have been their sister had made
her, one might say, sacrosanct,
tabu. Neither Dr. Boisragon nor
Mr. Ponting would ever again
think of having her in a closer
relationship. Mr. Ponting
would, presently, ask her to be
a sister to him; he would, very
proudly, on her acceptance,
hurry into Parramatta to buy
her the first of many gifts, a
pair of garnet earrings; he was
even to have the honor,
envisaged already, of giving her
away when she married. But
the second housemaid, Harriet,
whose devotion to him had out-
lasted many years, whose kiss
had been, in mistake, pressed on
his Excellency’s hand, not on
his ; she was destined to be Mrs.
Ponting.
Looking out of the sewing-
room window, through the first
green leaves of the white acacias
and their pendant cones of
privet-white, Babette saw Dr.
Boisragon drive away. She heard
his direction to his coachman:
“Gander’s Pond.” She knew
what that meant. She realised,
too, Mr. Footing's change of
heart (but how often in the suc-
ceeding years was she to lean on
him for some help or kindness),
and she felt her lonely, forsaken
state acutely; yes, she did.
Tears were not far from the
lovely eyes as she noticed, idly,
a fairy-martin threading a dizzy
way among the ineffable green
fronds of the acacias. Came a
second. She soon could not
count the flash of circling wings,
so soft, so moist-looking in their
rusty-red plumage; so noiseless,
yet giving, in the softness of
their airy persiflage, a hint of a
butterfly’s downy powdered
beauty.
This phenomenon, which
autumn might have brought, but
never spring, had hardly inspired
her wonder when the clop-clop
of a rough swaying trot was to
be heard approaching, and, in
a piercing strain, the popular
tune “When Cardigan the Fear-
less” whistled with bravura, like
an overture before the rising
curtain, resolved itself presently
into the sight of the gallant
young ferryman himself, who
immediately, and with a lover’s
eye, caught sight of the pale,
wistful face set among the
flowery branches; but what he
said to Babette, reining in his
hairy-hooved mount under her
window, is nobody’s business.


Women's letters
From Melbourne
Alison Joan, younger daughter of Dr.
and Mrs. A. P. Gorman of Deniliquin
(N.S.W.), made a very lovely bride when
she stood at the altar steps of St. Peter’s,
Toorak, to exchange vows with Neville
Robin Landale, younger son of Mr.
Nevill Armytage and the late Mrs.
Armytage, of Quiamong, Conargo
(N.S.W.). Celebrant of nuptials was the
Rev. Father W. Ebsworth. The bride’s
gown of magnolia satin had a long-
sleeved bodice with a wide scalloped
neckline and a slim skirt which fell into a
wide train. Her Limerick-lace veil was
held by a half-circlet of orange-blossoms
and she carried waterlilies. A trio of
pretty ’maids was in attendance;
Margaret Cosgrove, the bridegroom’s
sister Judith and Patricia Gavan Duffy.
Their full-skirted gowns were of pearl-
grey chiffon over pink taffeta, and
circlets of Cecil Brunner roses were worn
to match their bouquets. Donald, brother
of the bridegroom, was best-man and his
cousin Norman Armytage and David
Sargood groomsmen. Reception was at
the Hotel Windsor.
Making her first public appearance
since the death of her husband, Sir James
Disney, Lady Disney was hostess at a
small luncheon-party at the Ress-Astoria
Hotel. Guest-of-honor was Alma Peder-
sen, who, with her father, Cr. G. F.
Pedersen, is off to London in May. Lady
Disney’s smart suit was of black Bedford
cord and her small beret was finished with
silk tassels. Alma added to her grey-and-
white-striped jacket-suit a wide-brimmed
hat of grey felt.
There were over 100 guests at the
cocktail-buffet dinner-party given by Capt.
Robert Wayne Denbo, U.S. Naval
Attache, and Mrs. Denbo, at Cliveden
Mansions. After months of searching
for a home, the party was given the night
before Capt. Denbo, his wife and four
children moved to their new Toorak
abode. Mrs. Denbo’s short evening-
dress of beige lace had short sleeves and
was contrasted with a cluster of deep-
red roses. Among the guests were Lord
Mayor O. J. Nilsen and his daughter Mrs.
John Inkster, who wore a wide-brimmed
black hat with her simple black frock.
Mrs. Henry Stebbins, wife of the U.S.
Consul-General, was also in black ; her
small hat had a vizor veil. A deep-green
fringe was featured on the stole which
Mrs. W. W. Killough wore with her black
frock ; her turban was of emerald-and-
white-striped taffeta. A black tricorne
hat with a trimming of white ostrich-
feather was worn by Mrs. H. Bettle with
her black frock. A black faille suit and
white-feather toque were the choice of
Mrs. R. Ramey, wife of the U.S. Mili-
tary Attache. Her daughter Miriam was
in turquoise-blue crepe and a white hat.
Tiny Carol Lambert was overcome
with shyness when, at the opening of the
Red Cross Market Fair in the Town Hall,
she presented Lady Brooks, the Gover-
nor’s wife, with a bouquet of red roses.
But with her usual grace and charm
Lady Brooks soon put at ease this small
associate-member of Junior Red Cross.
Introduced by Colonel Allan Spowers,
chairman of the Victorian Division of
Red Cross, Lady Brooks commended all
those who had worked valiantly to stock
the stalls with goods, which were of out-
standing quality and design. And never
has the Town Hall looked so gay and
colorful. It was indeed an old-world
English market with streamers of multi-
colored plastic draped from the ceiling to
look like a Maypole and with deep red-
and-white-striped trimmings topping each
stall. One of the most popular stalls was
that for travel-goods, convened by Mrs.
Gerald Bacon and staffed by American
women. There was a bookstall; a stall
where only lavender sachets were sold ;
basketware made in Red Cross rest-
homes was of excellent workmanship and
sold quickly. There were stalls stocked
with knitwear for men, women and
children: whatever the need, the Red
Cross Market Fair supplied it. Red Cross
officials say this was the best yet held.
It was the final function for the March
Red Cross Appeal.
Sir Norman Mighell, the new chairman
of the British Memorial Fund, choosing
this month to make a public appeal for
support, gathered in Lord Mayor O. J.
Nilsen to launch the undertaking. The
Lord Mayor invited representatives of
many organisations and women members
of the B.M.F. to the Town Hall and duly
did the honors. Among those who
attended were Mrs. Essington Lewis, in
grey-and-black-etched silk frock and
wide-brimmed black straw hat; Mrs.
Karl Kumm, whose frock of black sheer
was worn with a white hat; Mrs. Olive
Thfing, in uavy-and-white sheer with a
sma p flower-trimmed white panama ;
]yj rs l Green, who topped her off-white
ljnen jacket . suit with a black sequin-
trimmed hat; Vera Bradford, who con-
trasted a pretty ii me .green linen jacket-
suit with a black straw picture-hat; Hilda
M c L eail; w b G wore with her white wide-
brimmed sailor hat a navy-and-white silk

son of Mrs. G adys Myer, also of Toorak,
an ° r ' hloiman Myer.
Honored by the late King George m
his last Birthday Honors list, Dame Mary
My. Pictured here, richly deserves her
distinction. Wife of Dr. J. J. Daly, of
Thornbury, and mother of Mane and
J°hn, she commenced her voluntary
chanty-work as a member of St. Vincent s
Hospital Auxiliary. Dame Mary worked
with the auxiliary until in 1941 she be-
came president of the Catholic Women’s
Organisation, a group which has a very
fine record, and Dame Mary is still its
president. She is also a member of the
executive council of the Victorian
Division of Red Cross, and was chairman
of the committee which most successfully
organised the ball at St. Kilda Town
Hall, proceeds from which aided the
March appeal for Red Cross,
There were groupings of lovely
hydrangeas, dahlias and autumn leaves
in the decor for this ball. At
the back of the official enclosure was
hung on a silver backdrop the emblem
of Red Cross. The effect on the stage
was striking: massed with shrubs and
greenery to represent the garden of a
Red Cross rest-home, the work of this
international institution was shown by an
invalid ex-serviceman being wheeled in a
chair by a Red Cross nurse. Dame Mary
Daly, wearing a lovely gown of aqua
French brocade patterned in a silver-leaf
design, received the official guests with
the chairman of the Victorian Division
of Red Cross, Colonel Allan Spowers,
and the chairman of the Citizens’ Appeal
Committee, Major-General F. Kingsley
Norris. Premier J. McDonald was
received with his wife, she wearing a
gown of black lace splashed with gold
sequins. The Lady Mayoress, Mrs. John
Inkster, who was with her father, Lord
Mayor Nilsen, wore satin in soft blue
tonings. With the Consul-General for
fhe U.S.A., Henry Stebbins, was Mrs.
Stebbins, who wore pale-grey chiffons
with the three frills set at the waistline
and hem of the skirt edged with pale-
pink satin.
Secretary of the ball committee, Mrs.
A. A. Lord, chose an unusual black silk
gown made from a sari she bought in
Bombay. It had a wide panel down the
front, embroidered with gold, flame and
green metal-thread. In her party was
Mrs. J. A. Twiddle, an English visitor,
whose gown was of pink corded taffeta.
Mrs. Eric Cottrell was in gold lace, Mrs.
John Reed in white organza faintly pat-
terned in autumn tonings. There were
three ticket-secretaries: Mrs. Hugh Mc-
Kenzie, in a graceful gown of palest lime
chiffon; Mrs. Jim Peters, her bouffant
gown of white tulle; and Mrs. W.
Calanchini, whose choice was midnight-
blue-and-silver brocade. Mrs. S. Baillieu
Myer’s black Chantilly laces were allied
with beige organdie. Heavy white lace
outlined the bodice and waist of Mrs.
Eccles McKay’s black gown. Dove-grey
chiffons were worn by Mrs. Allan
Spowers.
From Sydney
First thing this Letter makes for at
the Show are the handcrafts, which this
year maintain a high standard. There is
some cause for complaint in the arrange-
ment of the exhibits, for often the prize-
winners are placed so that it is hard to
see the stitches. The lighting on the
whole could be improved. The champion
piece is a handkerchief worked by Mrs.
T. Gruen Nash of such minute and
exquisite workmanship it is astonish-
ing that Australian fingers could have
fashioned it. The type of work is often
seen in handworked imports from China,
but its pattern and design are in a different
class from even the finest of the other
exhibits, such as those shown by Miss
P. Ng. The knitters once again con-
centrated on the actual stitchery. Few
gave thought to fashion lines. The
winning exhibit in the girl’s-cardigan
section is as wide as it’s long (of course,
some girls are that way, too, it must be
admitted). Congratulations go to Mrs.
H. Marr, who won the colored-supper-
cloth section, in which there were 51
entries, to Miss D. Dawes for her
wonderful cross-stitch, and Mrs. A. J.
Mitchell, who collected four seconds
and two thirds.
Reckoned a Good Thing by delegates
were the three microphones in the aisles
at the Assembly Hall during the Red
Cross conference. Those wishing to
speak queued up at these, and all got a
hearing, for, say what you may about
queuing being a form of regimentation,
it is quite the fairest way, and much
better than the nerve-wracking and
chancy business of trying to catch the
chairman’s eye.
Dorothy Shain (in the picture) is a
potential Portia, having been admitted to
the Bar at the recent ceremony at the
Supreme Court. Miss Shain is a graduate
in Arts of Melbourne University, and
bolds her LL.B. from Sydney University.
At the ceremony there were 33 men
admitted to the Bar, but Miss Shain was
the only woman. Although there are quite
a creditable number of women practising
as solicitors in Sydney at present, the
number of women barristers is trifling,
for no matter how high a reputation
women may have for winning arguments
those that have the courage to speak up
in court are very few. Here’s good luck,
therefore, to Dorothy Shain, Her photo
is by Hugh Spencer.
That Australia has quite a lot to learn
from Britain in social services is the
opinion of Mrs. John Moore, 0.8. E., who
spoke on her experiences abroad at the
Red Cross Conference. The British are
not so “spoon-fed” as we are led to
believe in this matter, as they have to pay
quite a heavy weekly tax to cover the
social services they receive. In England
the voluntary bodies such as the Red
Cross work in conjunction with the Gov-
ernment, which Mrs. Moore thinks is as
it should be. One valuable service for
which a petrol allowance is made by the
Government is the free transport to and
from hospital, which is offered by
voluntary workers. Sometimes the trans-
port is given only to the nearest railway-
station, but in some cases patients are
taken as far as 40 or 50 miles. Another
worth-while service is provided by the
meals on wheels which ensure at least
one good hot meal per week for invalid
and old-age pensioners at the cost of Is.
The Government subsidises the produc-
tion of the meals, while voluntary
workers give their services and have
raised funds for the mobile canteens
which take the meals to the homes of
these pensioners. Altogether Mrs. Moore
thinks that Britain is showing a good deal
of imagination in its social services and
trying out many new experiments by
which we could benefit.
The name of Boddington Sanatorium
has been changed to Boddington Hos-
pital. Dr. Godby said in his speech
at the conference, as those in charge
of treatment for tuberculosis hope to
relegate the word “sanatorium” to the
limbo into which the word “consump-
tion” has gone. “Hospital” is regarded
as much more in keeping with the new
type of treatment for T.B.
There is a new edition on sale in the
bookshops of that classic which ought
to be in every home. The Young Visiters
or Mr. Salteenas Plan by Daisy Ashford.
This book was written by a child of nine
years and first published in 1919, when
J. M. Barrie wrote a preface guarantee-
ing its authenticity, but thereby incurring
a good deal of suspicion that he wrote it
himself. It is irresistibly funny, both in
its vigor and its ingenuousness. Note the
gaiety and vitality of the style in this
passage:
Then they pealed on the bell and the
door flew open. Sounds of laughter and
comic songs issued from the abode and in
a second they were in the crowded draw-
ing room. It was packed with all the Elite
and a stout duchess with a good natured
face was singing a lively song and causing
much merriment. The earl strode forward
at sight of the two new comers. Hullo
Bernard old boy he cried this is a pleasure.
The double-meanings that childish
innocence gives to other situations is
also amusing: “I have given the best
spare room to Miss Monticue said Ber-
nard with a gallant bow and yours
turning to Mr Salteena opens out of it
so you will be nice and friendly.” The
new edition by Chatto and Windus is
attractively illustrated and costs 55., so
there’s no excuse for not possessing it.
The only thing that puzzles this Letter
about the authorship is what happened
to Daisy Ashford? Where is she now?
Whom did she marry? What else did she
write? Nothing is known, so the doubt
does persist that she doesn’t exist, and
if J. M. Barrie did write the book much
of its curiosity value is lost.
Another book coming on to the book-
shelves this week and designed for the
escapist is Deborah by Marian Castle
(Shakespeare Head). In parts it is so
naively told that it reminds one of the
Young Visiters. “ ‘l’d certainly admire
to take you to a real hotel some day,’
says one of Deborah’s admirers. ‘Lob-
ster a la Neuberg, potatoes au gratin,
asparagus vinaigrette—maybe a claret
cup’ He went on dreamily, ‘And
then maybe to the theatre afterwards in
a hansom cab to see the Floradora Sex-
tette —you’d be wearing a big bunch of
Parma violets —we’d have a little supper
afterwards’ ‘It —it sounds lovely,’
stammered Deborah, quite overcome.”
Still, it is quite an interesting story of an
ambitious woman, told with vigor and
simplicity. Maybe Marian Castle is
Daisy Ashford grown up? At least it’s
an idea.
It is doubtful whether many of the
goods shown last week at the Leather
Industries exhibition will ever reach the
shelves and counters of our stores, for
they are on the wellnigh proscribed list
of imports, which is a pity. It would
have been nice to see around town the
cream luxon handbags in circular shape
with the inner waterproof compartment,
the handbags in the Gladstone mode
and those which can be turned upside-
down with safety. The men will miss
the distinction of the leather pyjama-
case that looks like a briefcase, the fold-
ing-up leather slippers and the document-
and overnight-cases. Still, as some of the
handbags would probably cost about £l5,
and a suite of travelling-cases in golden-
tan hide for a man and a woman would
cost well over £l2O, perhaps we mightn t
have had much chance of actually hand-
ling these beautiful things.
The National Opera Ball, one of the
leading costume dances of the year, and
distinguished for its pageantry, is to be
held this year at the A.C.I. Ballroom on
August 16. Mrs. Tom Bateman is presi-
dent of the Ball committee, with Claudia
Beazley and Mrs. W. Simpson as her
right and left hand to help. Noticed that
pianist Eunice Gardiner was present at
the committee-meeting, also Mrs. C. T
Lorenz, Mrs. Ray Harrison, Mrs. W.
O’Neill, Mrs. Walter Bunning, Mrs. K-
Gloster and Madame Ferrari-Passmore.
Kinneil restaurant was alive with
Consul-Generals and their wives on
Thursday night, when a toast and fareweii
was accorded to retiring dean of the
consular corps, Mr. E. C. Vrisakis, an
Madame Vrisakis. The new dean, Mr. ri.
Hedinger, Consul-General of Switzerland,
and Mrs. Hedinger were hosts, and pre-
sented a silver salver in recognition o
the valuable services of Mr. and Madame
Vrisakis to the corps. At the same
party the Consul-General of i, u §.'
slavia and Madame Vjekoslav Cvrije
were farewelled. After two Y ea '’s
office in Sydney they will return sir i >
to Belgrade.

PERSONAL ITEMS
New Chief Justice of Australia, Sir
Owen Dixon, was appointed to the High
Court in 1929 after a distinguished career
at the Bar. Several times since then his
talents have been borrowed for use else-
where in the service of his country, as
when, early in the war, he was asked to
assume the chairmanship of the Central
Wool Committee and, not so long after-
wards, of the Coastal Shipping Control
Committee and the Marine War Risks
Insurance Board. He relinquished these
posts in 1942 when John Curtin per-
suaded him to go to Washington as Aus-
tralian Minister. Returning to the Bench
towards the war’s end he again put his
wig aside in 1950 to tackle the difficult
task of United Nations mediator in
Kashmir. For those who know Dixon
his failure to find a compromise accept-
able to both India and Pakistan merely
emphasised the almost insoluble nature
of the Kashmir dispute.
One victim claimed by the March bush-
fires in Victoria was Reginald Somerville
Kemp, who died while firefighting on
O. J, Syme’s property at Macedon. A
product of Malvern Grammar, Scotch
College and the Wagga Experimental
Farm, Kemp went away to the first war
at 18 and was badly wounded and gassed
at Bullecourt. After the war he managed
properties in Victoria and Queensland
and then bought Farnley, at Benalla, and
ran it for 10 years. In 1935 he and his
wife circled Australia in a specially-
designed caravan, taking seven months on
the trip and including long stays on out-
bade stations in the Northern Territory
and the Kimberleys. Since then he had
been managing the Syme property and
had built up the Romney Marsh stud
to a very high standard.
Asked to explain briefly the function
of the science of Statistics, Professor
Patrick Moran, who has just come back
to Australia to open a research school
in the subject at the National University
in Canberra, said its chief purpose was
the application of the Theory of Prob-
ability to other sciences. As an after-
thought he added, “Including gambling.”
This led naturally to a discussion on the
mathematical chances at roulette and two-
up, and Moran told how the investigations
of 17th-century mathematicians in this
field, forgotten until rediscovered early
in the war, had greatly reduced the cost
and labor of checking the standards of
countless items of equipment mass-
produced for war purposes. Then some-
one realised that the “new” system, which
involved a change in the method of
sampling, would be just as useful in
Hitler’s factories as in Churchill’s. So it
was that a principle discovered 300
years ago by toying around with
gambling-systems became a “top-secret” of
World War 11. Sydney-born son of the
late Dr. H. M. Moran, the new professor
has spent most of his adult life as re-
search student and lecturer at Oxford
and Cambridge—he’s an M.A. of both
universities as well as a Sydney Bachelor
of Science—with a war-time break at the
Ministry of Supply and as Australian
scientific liaison-officer in operational
research.
“Ek D”: The statement that General
Sir John Northcott was a “recruit” at
Albury Training Camp in 1912 (B.
2/ 4 / ’52) is off the beam. The N. S. Wales
Governor of today had a commission
in the 9th A.L.H. as far back as 1908,
and by 1912 was a captain —quite big
potatoes for a youth of 22, in an age when
majors on the staff in the A.M.F. held
the kind of jobs today filled by brigadiers.
He was an original Anzac, becoming
adjutant to the gallant 12th Battalion,
heroes of many a gallant battle on
Gallipoli, where he was severely wounded,
a circumstance which almost certainly
deprived him of the chance to be included
among World War I’s high-ranking com-
manders.
Off to America and Europe as Aus-
tralia’s representative to the International
Conference on the Blind to be held at
Bussum, Holland, Stannus William Hedger,
M.8.E., director of the Royal Victorian
Institute for the Blind. Born in Sydney
and educated at Fort-street, he has thought
about the blind and worked among them
since he was 15, when he commenced his
training at the N.S.W. Blind Institute.
He also represented Australia at an earlier
international conference in London, and
in 1948 the Carnegie Corporation thought
so highly of him that it paid the expenses
of a world tour by air when he visited
America, Canada and England. He will
meet in New York the deaf-blind child
who was sent on his recommendation to
the New York School for the Blind for
special training.
First Australian Ambassador to
Western Germany, John Hood goes there
from a similar post in Jakarta. He has
been in the diplomatic service for 16
years and his experience includes terms
in London and Holland, service on a
U.N. committee on refugees, trips to the
Paris Peace Conference in 1946, and to
Greece with a Security Council committee
in 1947. For two years he was Aus-
tralian delegate at U.N. sessions. This
won’t be his first experience of Germany ;
he was political adviser to the Australian
Military Mission in Berlin.
Another new Ambassador is Dr. E. R.
Walker, former lecturer in economics at
Sydney University, economic adviser to
Governments of N. S. Wales and Tas-
mania, and Deputy-director-general of the
Department of War Organisation of In-
dustry ; he is to represent Australia in
Japan. From 1945 to 1951 Walker was
attached to the Australian Embassy in
Paris as economic counsellor for Europe,
but he was brought back home last year
to organise the National Security Re-
sources Board.
Artist Lusby, eager to show his victim
that palaeontology was not entirely a
closed book to him, remarked that he
understood that fossil-hunters deduced
the age of fossils from the geological
strata in which they were found. “That’s
what geologists probably tell you,” re-
plied Harold Fletcher, chief palseont —er,
fossil-man —of the Australian Museum.
“Actually, it’s the other way round.
Fossils are a guide to the age of the
strata. Take graptolites, for example . ..”
Fletcher should know his fossils. He’s
been studying them, digging ’em out and
classifying them for 30 years, and his
work has at times taken him a long way
from the Museum —to Lake Callabonna,
Australia’s biggest boneheap of pre-
FOSSIL-MAN.
historic animals ; twice to the Antarctic
with Mawson; across the Simpson
Desert with C. T. Madigan. Now he is
off on a four-months trip to Central and
Northern Australia as leader of a
scientific expedition which hopes to find
specimens of rare birds and animals
generally thought to be extinct. Also, of
course, young, middle-aged and elderly
graptolites.
The Bulletin had been under the im-
nression that the imposing dome outlined
here by Coventry belonged to a skiing
instructor at Kosciusko who dropped into

discuss liferature and art and who sold
washing-machines, bath-heaters and
aluminium dothes-pegs as a hobby. This,

1930 and collected a Diploma in Com-
merce at the same institution in 1949.
Because of or despite all this, he is a
member of the executive committee and
council of the S.A. Chamber of Manu-
factures and is in his second year as
president of the Adelaide Chamber of
Commerce.
With the death in Brisbane of Norman
Bourke, the Flying Doctor Service lost a
great friend and supporter. He became
president of the Queensland section in
1939, and was still in that post at the
finish; for two years he was general
president for Australia. Under his presi-
dency the Queensland branch grew from
one base and plane to four bases and
four doctors. In his time Bourke had
been jackeroo, station-bookkeeper, shear-
ing-contractor, stock-and-station agent
and pastoralist—among the properties
with which he was connected were
Kamilaroi, Tilbaroo, Essex and Sesbania.
About 25 years ago he settled in Bris-
bane, becoming a director of several large
companies, president of the United
Graziers’ Association and a member of
the Australian Meat Board and the Wool
Board. Seventy-eight at the finish, he is
survived by his wife, formerly Miss Jess
Kennedy, a war-nurse and one of a well-
known Queensland pastoral family.
The Australian Medal of Agricultural
Science for 1952 goes to Professor E. J.
Underwood, Hackett Professor of Agri-
culture at the University of Western Aus-
tralia, “in recognition of his distinguished
contributions to agricultural science
through teaching, research and direction
of research.” Professor Underwood has
been conducting research into infertility
of sheep maintained on clover pastures,
and into factors influencing the quality
of grain and of cereal hay. In addit on
to his university work he has acted as
chairman of a committee on agricultural
extension and research.
“R.CR.”: Bill Rowlinson, D.C.M.
and Bar (B. 2/4/’52), was always fond
of excitement. In World War II he rose
to rank of W. 0.11, then dropped it to
join the paratroops. At the end of the
war he volunteered as a malaria guinea-
pig. After being demobbed he went to
Atherton (N.Q.) farming with Glen Pike,
who writes short-stories in between farm
chores, and while there he contributed
to “The Man on the Land” page. He
joined up again early in the Korea show
and you know the rest, except that his
name isn’t Rowlandson ; it’s Rowlinson,
same as his father’s and his uncle’s —
and that’s me.
“Ishmael”: Last year in the little
Sussex village of Beckley, close to Rye,
on England’s ancient invasion-coast, Aus-
tralia came for Christmas. The church-
organist, Col. Philip Anstruther, had
chanced to hear on his wireless the
carols of John Wheeler set to music by
William C. James. He wrote to the
8.8. C. and asked to have them repeated,
only to find that no recording had been
made. After much hunting and detective-
work he at last managed to obtain words
and music of these Aussie carols. He
played them to the rector. Canon Hugh
Wilson, and it was decided that, together
with the traditional hymns, they would be
played and sung at Christmas. It was
pure coincidence that Philip Lindsay,
Norman’s son, should live in this village
and should have for guests Guy and
Lilian Howarth of Sydney University.
When they heard of this Aussie
Christmas, they turned up in force and
were thrilled to hear English men and
women singing of boobooks and brolgas,
oranas and lorikeets. They tell me that
the experience was one never to be for-
gotten, for this was no newspaper-stunt
or politician’s flapdoodle, but an expres-
sion of the true unity between the Old
Country and Australia.
Doyen of horticulturists attending
Garden Week in Melbourne is Thomas
William Pockett, 0.8. E., who won his
first prize for chrysanthemums at Chelten-
ham in England in 1876 when he was 10.
Growing the flowers which George
Moore said he didn’t like because they re-
minded him of carriage mops, is evidently
a healthy occupation —the veteran
propagator is 84 and has evolved
hundreds of new-named chrysanthemums.
He got his 0.8. E. for his services to Aus-
tralian horticulture, including the plant-
ing of 35 miles of street trees when he was
curator of Malvern Gardens, Melbourne.
Formerly lecturer in English at the
Westralian University, L. N. B. Thomas
has returned to Perth as director or the
Art Gallery. An ascetic-looking 37, he
wears the high brow, long nose and
pointed chin so often associated with the
artistic temperament. Thomas shed the
academic mortar-board for the sailor s
cap in 1940, and spent six years on active
service with the R.A.N. His switch from
literature to art was made when he came
ashore and won a Gowrie post-graduate
scholarship entitling him to go abroad to
study art. Since 1949 he has been
assistant-director of the Melbourne
Gallery.
Into the Silence:
In Perth, at 70, Frederick Charles Fox,
consulting-engineer who moved to 1 Westraha from
Burwood (N.S.W.) in 1945, when he commenced
research work on the gasification of Collie coal.
He died suddenly on the job.
In Perth, at 76, Dr. James Vere Arkle, a
London-trained medico who reached Westraha
by way of New Zealand and the Eastern States
in 1907. He practised in Kalgoorlie for 12
years and in Perth for the rest of his time,
excluding war service with the First A.I.F.
In Timaru (N.Z.), at 90, Captain Charles
Macarthur, for many years skipper of Union
Co. steamers, founder of the firm of shipping
agents that bears his name and of the Golden
Bay Cement Company. While a director of
Golden Bay he had the honor of presenting to
representatives of Holland, on behalf of the
New Zealand Government, the land on which
Abel Jasman first set foot on New Zealand
soil.
In Darwin, Mrs. Marion Flynn, the town’s
oldest resident, who arrived there in 1893. After
her husband’s death Mrs. Flynn ran a restaurant
until her retirement. Her son Harold was one
of the best-known tennis-players and cricketers
in Darwin’s pre-war days.
At Milton (Q.), at 86, Richard Power, old
railwayman and, in his time, a stanchion or tne
Labor party in Queensland. His son, William
Power, was Minister for Mines and Immigra-
tion and is the present Attorney-General m
the Gair Government. The son has since 1935
represented Baroona, where his father was tor
years a branch-member.

GUARANTEED NEVER TO FADE OR SHRINK
SUNDRY SHOWS
Two Concertos.
To garnish an otherwise
Lucullan musical feast, Eugene
Goossens—running true to the
form now despairingly expected
of him by Sydney audiences —■
chose some auxiliary dishes
which, to say the least, struck
dubiously on the palate.
He started off last week’s
Sydney concert with a musical
soup so thin the pattern of the
plate was clearly visible through
it: The “Secret of Susanna”
Overture. This music is as
undistinguished as the plot of
the opera is puerile—the lady’s
secret being her surreptitious
addiction to the drinking of
coffee!
The hors-d’oeuvre was Elgar’s
“Introduction and Allegro.” As
in so much of Elgar this music
for the strings is richly scored
and highly polished, but there
is lacking some vital ingredient
which would make it wholly
palatable. There is certainly
nothing in it sufficiently appetis-
ing to prepare the palate for the
music which followed: the piano
concertos of Schumann and
Tschaikowsky.
Gieseking started off with the
Schumann. The opening move-
ment of this work has been
likened to a classical oration,
and certainly there was
eloquence in the sweeping
passages in which piano and
orchestra joined in the first
subject’s development and
exposition. In the second part
of the movement the rhythms
were only partly hidden by the
arpeggio figure in the left hand,
to excellent effect. The cadenza
was an exposition not so much
of the usual digital dexterity as
of a thoughtful variation, almost
deliberate, on the thematic
subjects. The Intermezzo was
all flowing lyricism, always
touched with intellectual quality.
The final movement brought
some beautiful tone-color from
the orchestra and playijng of
great verve by Gieseking, parti-
cularly in the section where
groups of six notes were played
at lightning speed with ornamen-
tation of the first note of the
group, and in the continuous
trilling in the high reaches
against the melody in the left
hand. The whole work was
invested with the poetic quality
which is the very essence of it.
The Tschaikowsky Concerto
No. 1 is in an entirely different
category from the Schumann,
It is much more spectacular, and
has greater breadth and vivid- ,
ness of color. The almost brutal I
forthrightness of the first move-
ment is established with the
powerful chords from the solo
instrument set against the tutti
of the orchestra. Later the
woodwinds did some fine work,
and the ensuing cadenza brought
out the most vivid pianism of the /
night. In the second movement'
the weaving of the piano’s tone
through the dreamy background
supplied by flute, bassoons and
muted strings was of beautiful
texture. The Rondo flashed into
great animation under the
pianist’s masterful playing, with
brilliant scale-passages and a
great climax that brought almost
hysterical applause practically as
the last chords were hammered
out. It was highly emotional
playing, well sustained. Despite
this, however, the best work of
both pianist and orchestra went
into the Schumann work.
After this sumptuous fare the
audience might at least have
expected a soupfon of some
delicious sweet to round things
off. Instead, Goossens dispensed
with this and went straight to
the nuts with Ravel’s “La Valse”
—where in this is the vaunted
French logic?
The piece dithers around for
about seven minutes before any
suggestion of a lilting measure
appears, and even then it is only
comparatively fragmentary be-
fore the music again deteriorates
into long-winded nothingness.
Sadly the audience groped under
the chairs for their hats after
this denouement.
"Cavalleria
Rusticana."
The National Opera Co.
wound up its season at Mel-
bourne Princess with Mascagni’s
rude, rough, realistic opera, and
a packed house gave its
undivided attention to the
trump-card, who was Marie

Her warm voice, though it has
some of the usual shortcomings
of beginners, followed the
emotional line of the orchestral

Miss Collier s passionate per-
formance may have stimulated
her confreres, and Neil Easton,
as Alfeo, the carter, bit the left
ear of Ivor Sheridan, his rival,
with great heartiness, and the
subsequent knife-play culminat-
ing in murder was intensely
realistic, Sheridan, a Sydney
tenor, has a ringing voice, a
trifle forced in places, and
Muriel Luyk was adequate as
Lola.
Alan Light, another Sydney
singer, sang the Prologue to
“Pagliacci” with far more intel-
ligence than many other better
singers. Alwyn Smith, Robert
Simmonds, Ronald Dowd and
Lorenzo Nolan kept up the
tempo well of the subsequent
mad proceedings.
Gerhard Willner, the Viennese
pianist, brought his Beethoven
marathon to a brilliant conclu-
sion last week at the Assembly
Hall in Melbourne with a
magnificent performance of the
most difficult and possibly the
greatest of the man of Bonn’s
32 sonatas—Op. 111, the one
which opens with the deepest
and most agonising groan in
musical literature and goes on
like a bull charging, ending with
what sounds like a song of battle
triumph Having 32 sonatas to
work through and only eight
evenings to do it in, Mr. Willner
had to tackle four on each
occasion, and this was sometimes
a bit too much even for
this devoted player. Generally
speaking, however, he kept to
his own high standard, and his
musical memory was amazing.
There was cheering when he
crossed the finishing-line.
A Mixed Bag.
Grace Cossington Smith’s
“Gum Blossom and Drapery” is
the showpiece of the 1952
Easter Exhibition at the Mac-
quarie Galleries, Sydney. Painted
in the artist’s familiar manner
—light and color picked out in
delicate flecks of paint —the
whole picture vibrates with light
like shimmering, sunshot lace
and presents flowers as they are:
trembling and alive in contrast
to the decorative and waxen
immobility of pieces like Adrian
Feint’s “Hibiscus in Pewter”
and Paul Jones’s “Flowers.”
One can look at both Feint’s
and Jones’s flower-painting and
admire the color and the cold
carving of form in them, but to
turn from them to “Gum
Blossom and Drapery” is like
stepping from cold-storage into
the sunlight.
Donald Friend has a fiery
j little sketch, “The Riders,” Justin
O’Brien a design of attenuated
figures in various awkward
postures and mainly in blue and
red; and Sidney Nolan a
“Dream of Jacob,” a distorted
grey face with a vision of enough
timber for a lumber-yard and
another awkward figure floating
down among it. Since Mr.
O’Brien has said so, he at least
is serious about what he is
doing and saying here; so,
presumably, are Friend and
Nolan ; but what they are trying
to say or do, and what one
might do with the paintings,
hovers comfortably beyond the
imagination.
Likewise, the purpose and use
of lan Fairweather’s elaborate
doodling escape definition along
with Michael Kmit’s watery
self-portrait; John Passmore,
still apparently in headlong
pursuit of Cezanne with “Boys
and Pear Tree,” still gives too
much evidence of looking too
hard at Cezanne and not hard
enough at nature. There are
50-year-old echoes, too, in
John D. Moore’s “The Swim-
ming Place,” which looks like
an attempt to impose a poetic
vision on the commonplace of
Sydney’s Nielson Park, but
despite a tremendous amount of
paint the attempt is only partly

Britstand Equipment at work on
the Keepit Dam, a water conser-
vation project under construction
in the north-west N.S.W.
In the days that lie ahead, Britstand Equipment will be
playing a major part in the development of our country.
Our many undertakings—water storage and conservation;
hydro-electric schemes; irrigation; soil conservation; reaffores-
tation; road, railway and aerodrome construction—they all
have an important bearing on the lives of each of us. For
it is only in the development of our national resources that
our land and standard of living can be maintained and
improved.
Giant earthmoving machines and tractors supplied by the
Britstand organisation will continue to be a vital factor
in the defence and development of Australia. British
Standard Machinery Co. Ltd. are in the forefront in the
manufacture of large and small earthmoving equipment.
Here is Australia’s largest four-wheel

successful, mainly because the
dancing light cannot altogether
disentangle itself from the mass
of paint.
There are other echoes: of
Picasso in the head and, parti-
cularly, the eyes of Paul
Haefliger’s “Young Girl,” a
slight painting in which the
freshness of the head and face
is rather spoiled by the
awkwardness of the body and an
incredibly massive forearm ; of
George Lawrence in Arthur
Evan Read’s “Wet Season Coast
Scene,” a brown-yellow storm
scene not without a touch of
drama and movement in the
water; of modern American
travel advertising in Elaine
Haxton’s impossibly brilliant
“Narrabeen”; and of Japanese
prints in the graceful delicacy
of Jocelyn Rickards’s “The
Straw Hat.”
Drysdale has a large land-
scape in “Memorial to Jim Mc-
Dowell” reds and browns
weighed down by a depressing
sky; two large distorted figures
dominating the foreground and
another figure on a rearing horse
and leading what looks like a
string of horses in the middle
distance. The significance of it
is elusive ; it has its measure of
drama, but it looks like an
imaginative conception executed
with a club; it might pass on a
much smaller scale—in fact, a
small part of it would make a
nice hot little Drysdale landscape
—but its very largeness magnifies
its roughness.
Eric Wilson’s “The Canal” is
soft and brown and pleasing in
its balance of trees and build-
ings on each side of the water ;
Lloyd Rees’s “Road Through the
Village,” is smaller and little
warmer than his usual hard style,
but it lacks his usual cold, stark
strength.
Sali Herman’s “Victoria
Street, Potts Point,” is slight,
bright and pretty ; there is some
rather murky lyricism in J.
Carrington Smith’s “Trees”;
Roland Wakelin’s “Spring Land-
scape” is a comfortable, unpoetic
vision of fight and trees and
folded hills; George Duncan
has overreached his autumn
colors in “Morning in the
Bush” ; Joy Ewart’s “Portrait of
Jonquiere, St Vincent,” Ena
Joyce’s “Queensland Landscape”
and Gwen Eichler’s “Den
Haag” are familiar things; and
Francis Lymburner’s “The Pony
Tent,” even though it derives a
little strength from its very dark-
ness, is much too muddy.
O. F.
Potted Peacock.
From London:
The London Mask Theatre
Company, which served the dis-
cerning theatregoer so valiantly
just before and just after the
outbreak of war in 1939, is again
well-established as a high-class
repertory. Its latest experiment
in offering a dramatisation of
Thomas Love Peacock’s satirical
novel. Nightmare Abbey (West-
minster Theatre), is a pure
delight that has brought second-
thoughts to at least one witness
whose literary self-education has
avoided this neglected contem-
porary of Keats, Byron, Shelley
and Coleridge.
Nightmare Abbey, one learns,
was a satire on the Romantic
Movement of the early 1800’s,
with Coleridge transcenden-
talism, overearnest lovers,
casement - imprisoned heroines,
pretentious and self-intoxicated
poets, verbose intellectuals and
cosseted hangers-on. Peacock
puts them all in a country-house
(admirably translated into plushy
Gothic angularity by Paul
Mayo’s settings), and super-
imposes an opera bouffe plot
to set off their highfalutin
gambols. Mr. Glowery is a
widower whose chief purpose is
to nurture and enjoy his
misanthropy. His son, Scythrop
(a gentle parody of Shelley), is
an unconvincing aesthete who is
torn between the coquettish,
musically - accomplished
Marionetta and the blue-
stocking Stella, and by his in-
voluntary duplicity loses both.
Mr. Toobad is a pessimist with
a predilection for fortune-
hunting. The Hon. Mr. Listless
is an effete who wallows in
sultry valetudinarianism. And
Mr. Flosky (a cruel caricature
of Coleridge, looking here aston-
ishingly like Beethoven) is an
aggressive windbag, whose
didactic tautology puts our
present-day donnish politicians
to shame.
Anthony Sharp’s adaptation
claims to include both verbatim
and synthetic Peacock, and it is
fair to say that the two are indis-
tinguishable. The acting is at
once sensitive and spacious, and
an example of the seriousness
without which extravaganza be-
comes mere silliness. Consider-
ing the amount of talk, John
Fernald has contrived to enliven
his production with a fertility of
pertinent action and invention.
It is a pity that the two women,
whose impact on this fantastic
community so enriched the first
act, are not seen again except as
“visions,” for their absence leads
to an end that is both premature
and anti-climatic.
"The Glass
Menagerie."
Brisbane Arts Theatre is
playing “The Glass Menagerie”
—Tennessee Williams’s study of
the efforts of a matriarch of an
impoverished American family
to make suitable arrangements
for the future of her crippled
daughter; she goads her son
into bringing home a workmate
presumed to be eligible for sister,
but after winning some measure
of the girl’s affections the visitor
confesses that he has already
promised to marry.
This slight story is made
dramatically effective by the
playwright’s ability to suggest
the dominant mood of the piece
—frustration —and by his keen
insight into character. Amanda,
the mother, is more than a
garrulous tyrant; she is always
a pathetic figure, rising in the
final scenes to tragic dignity.
Vivienne Campbell did not
appeal enough to the sympathy
of the audience, and, although
in her closing scenes she hit
the necessary tragic heights, it
was too late for the audience
to appreciate a character that
until then had only exasperated
it.
Olga Massey’s Laura had all
the frailty and tenderness the
role required—a fine study of
the utter loss of self-reliance
wrought by deformity and the
domination of her mother, Peter
Munro’s “gentleman caller” was
a I*s® uncertain of his where-
übouts on the social scale,
Morton Smith’s performance as
the son undermined the poetic
conception of the author with
too much petulance, but he gave
a creditable account as producer.
Imaginative sets and lighting
met the dramatist;* requirements
a non-reahstic presentation
°f a Pl a Y which purports to be
n ° more than a procession of
memories.
"Volpone."
Ben Jonson’s comedy about
the Venetian magniflco who
takes to his bed and feigns sick-
ness to fool his heirs was not the
best of Frank Thring’s produc-
tions at the Arrow Theatre,
Melbourne, but there was a
lavishness about its nonsense
which one supposes is in the
Elizabethan tradition.
As the foxy old gent. Mr.
Thring was suitably excessive,
and as his parasite, Mosca, who
works out plots and counter-
plots on his own hook, Robert
Herbert made a rich foil to his
master. Eunuchs, hermaphro-
dites, dwarfs and easy ladies
gave a lusty picture of the
manners and customs of
Venetian England or English
Venice, and the story moved all
the swifter because of the
excision of the sub-plots con-
cerning political allusions by
producer Robin Lovejoy, who,
however, didn’t exercise his blue
pencil on Mr. Jonson’s uncom-
promising use of language.
Show-time visitors to Sydney
have a fair stage selection to
pick from: ,“Brigadoon” is
running into its last weeks at the
Royal; the Borovansky Ballet
gives it last performance tonight
at the Empire with Kiwis due
to move in on Saturday ; and
“Peep Show” Looks like running
a good while yet at the Tiv. The
Independent and the Metro-
politan are doing nicely with
“Black Chiffon” and “Twelfth
Night” ; William Orr’s produc-
tion of Fry’s “A Sleep of
Prisoners” keeps cropping up
around the suburbs ; while John
Kay’s Mercury Theatre is main-
taining its prodigious programme
of Plautus’s “Twins,” “Comedy
of Errors, Moliere s Imaginary
Invalid,” Fry’s “Phoenix Too
Frequent and Anouilh s Point
of Departure. On April 17 they
are adding Strindberg’s “The
Father” to their repertoire
which is probably the first per-
formance of Strindberg in
Sydney since Dr. Cardamatis
produced ‘The Dream Play at
the Independent some years ago.


UNCABLED
ADDITIONS
WHAT NEXT IN KOREA?
Though cables now once
more hold out hopes of an early
truce in Korea (“before May”),
one question is still being asked
with increasing insistence in
America: What do we intend
to do if a truce just isn’t
obtainable?
The tragic farce of negotia-
tion is considered played out.
But still (says a New York
“Herald Tribune” correspon-
dent) the American policy-
makers simply shudder away
from the choice which confronts
them:
“Either they must accept the
indefinite prolongation of a
strategically impossible situation,
with a great proportion of this
country’s [America’s] still in-
adequate military strength com-
mitted in an exposed position,
on a peninsula of little strategic
value. Or they must be ready
to take unilateral action to force
the issue, accepting both the risk
of general war and the aliena-
tion of all this country’s allies.”
Gap in Policy
“Precise approved plans”
already exist for carrying the
war to the Chinese mainland, if
the Communists again attack in
force, and also for withdrawing
most American forces from
Korea if a successful truce is
negotiated, to the accompani-
ment of a flat warning that
renewed aggression will be
regarded as an act of war:
“Yet the great gap still
remains—what to do if the Com-
munists neither attack nor make
a truce, simply disregarding the
real issues while injecting an
endless series of unreal issues.
This is what has been happening
for months, and is still happen-
ing.
“While no pressure is brought
to bear on the Communists to
make a truce, this may go on
happening quite indefinitely.
Thus the time may soon be
coming when the United States
will warn the Communists that
either a truce is negotiated on
a reasonable basis, or the war
will start again in deadly earnest.
The risks of such a course are
very obvious and very great.
Our allies, especially the British,
will violently oppose the taking
of these risks. Yet this country
[U.S.A.] simply cannot indefi-
nitely commit much of its
military strength to the Korean
peninsula.”
American Wrangling
Doubts and hesitations over
Korea generally are seen by
“New York Times” as by no
means confined to America’s
allies:
“When outstanding political
leaders denounce the Korean
struggle as a ‘Truman war,’
when outstanding military
leaders alternately demand an
expansion of the war and a
withdrawal from Korea, and
when the U.S. House of Repre-
sentatives can be induced to pass
a resolution against further
military commitments abroad
which implies a slap at the
Korean commitment, there is
bound to arise confusion both
at home and abroad. Doubts are
raised in the minds of the United
Nations forces which will not
help their morale; encourage-
ment is given to the Com-
munists to drag out both the
fighting and the armistice
negotiations in the hope of split-
ting American opinion.”
West Weakening
New York “Herald Tribune”
reports a widespread belief that
adoption of the old MacArthur
programme would put a quick
end to the whole business.
“It would,” it comments, “be
convenient if this were true.
But General MacArthur was
dealing with a situation very
different from the present one;
there is no good military reason
today to think that anything
short of a renewal of full-scale
and very bloody war would
shake the Communists out of
their exasperating diplomatic
position in Korea.
“We are really facing a
problem in Korea very like that
which has proved so baffling in
Indo-China and Malaya and the
Philippines and elsewhere. Com-
munist aggression can be
stemmed; it can even be beaten
back, but it cannot be brought
to make peace. Even the war
in Greece would probably never
have been definitely won had it
not been for the defection of the
Communists’ Yugoslav base.
Communist - armed aggression
does not make peace.
“It can, perhaps, be worn out,
just as its own basic strategy is
directed toward wearing out the
enemy. But that means that
victory in the end goes to the
side with the most patience,
endurance and capacity to bear
up under the long strain. The
Western and anti-Communist
defences in Asia are showing too
many signs already of weakening
under this kind of slow pressure.
The United States cannot lend
any encouragement to that by
either defeatism or purposeless
recklessness in the Korean
problem.”
Vulnerable J. Bull
When London “Observer,”
which certainly can’t be called a
fire-eater —indeed its “foreign
policy” has been dubbed “a
rationalisation of cowardice” —
is plainly worried over this ques-
tion of what happens next in
Korea, and holds that a merely
negative British stand might
smack back hard on J. Bull, it
can be taken that, when it came
to the choice, there would be
few followers of the Socialist
Bevanites’ skeddadle to the
hollow-log.
The “Observer” does not face
the question posed by the prac-
tical stalemate of indefinitely
prolonged “negotiations,” but it
does look, rather fearfully, into
these others:
What is Britain’s policy if the
armistice negotiations in Korea
break down and there is another
full-scale Chinese land and air
offensive? What if an armistice
is concluded and then broken?
What if, with or without an
armistice in Korea, there is a
Chinese attack on Indo-China,
where the Chinese have long
been giving the Vietminh forces
the kind of help that Greece’s
northern neighbors gave to the
Communist insurgents in 1946-
49? What if there is an attack
on Burma? What if there is an
attack on Hong Kong—recently
the target of intensive Chinese
propaganda? What if there is
an attack, on Formosa, repeatedly
forecast by Peking?
In many of those cases an
effective defence by purely local
limited action on the Korean
model is considered highly
doubtful. The question would
then pose itself whether Britain
should agree to risk full-scale
war in China —which it wishes to
avoid if at all possible—or
whether to let aggression
triumph, with all its conse-
quences for world peace.
“Many people, when thinking
of the danger of war with
China,” comments the
“Observer,” “see only that such
a war could be forced on us
[Britain] by America ; they oddly
overlook that it could also be
forced on us by China. In fact,
this second danger is, for the
moment, far closer.
“Whatever might happen if
Senator Taft should be elected
American President, under the
present American Administration
the fear that America might de-
liberately attack China, either
directly or by proxy through
General Chiang Kai-shek, has
little substance. There is more
reason to fear that China might
deliberately attack Indo-China,
or Burma, or Hong Kong or
Formosa. And it is worth noting
that in many of these possible
areas of Chinese attack it is our
interests, not America’s, which
are directly threatened.”
Would U.S. Help Us?
America, the “Observer”
thinks, would probably risk
full-scale war rather than allow
China to conquer South Korea,
Japan or Formosa: “But it is
most doubtful whether she
would go to war with China —
and risk world war—for Hong
Kong, Burma or Indo-China. It
is for us to make up our minds
whether we are prepared to yield
Hong Kong or South-East Asia
to possible Chinese aggression;
or, if not, how we intend to
defend them ; and how we hope
to associate America, Australia,
New Zealand, and possibly
India, with such action.
“We can hardly hope to get
American backing for it unless
we, on our part, are ready to
associate ourselves with America
in the guarantee of Formosa (as
well as Korea and Japan) against
a possible Chinese attack. For

THEY’RE GETTING NEAR THE FALLS NOW.
to keep Formosa out of hostile
hands is as vital an interest for
America as it is for us to keep
South-East Asia out of hostile
hands. But we, on our part,
can hardly guarantee Formosa
unless its non - aggressive
character vis-a-vis China is put
beyond doubt —which means at
the very least an international
ratification of the present
voluntary and one - sided
American neutralisation policy,
and preferably also an interna-
tional regime for Formosa in
preparation for self-determina-
tion. This, in turn, would require
the elimination of General
Chiang Kai-shek from the
scene.
“From this point a way
through the present tangle might
open up, and a real policy might
come into sight.”
Korean Blunder.
An American correspondent
caustically criticises a specimen
of U.S. blundering on Korean
p.-0.-w.
In New York “H era 1 d
Tribune” he asserts that with
mere reasonable care in Tokyo
and Washington “the heart-
rending” p.-0.-w. problem need
never have arisen.
The trouble is over North
Korean and Chinese troops who
have deserted to the U.N. side,
some of them lured by U.S.
leaflets promising security. To
send them back would be to
condemn them to torture or
death.
Since decision on such issues
is in the circumstances an
American responsibility, the cor-
respondent uses “we” accord-
ingly:
“With a little foresight and
commonsense we would have
had no prisoners-of-war who
could not be repatriated. We
would have released them long
ago. We would be holding no
prisoners-of-war today who
could not be exchanged. The
anti-Communist Chinese would
be on their way to Formosa.
The anti-Communist North
Koreans would have disappeared
among the South Korean
population.
“Instead of doing that, we
have not only detained them as
prisoners-of-war but we have
actually transmitted their names
to the enemy authorities. By
this monumental piece of
stupidity we have made it cer-
tain that even if the enemy were
to agree to our position that no
prisoner must be forced to go
home, those who do not now
choose to go home have to
realise that their families are
marked and in danger.
“We have also made it
virtually impossible for the
Communist Governments to
agree to an exchange of
prisoners. For now—if they
agree to our demands—it will
be known and it will be published
to the world exactly how many
of their own soldiers have
turned against them, each of
them identified by name and by
regiment.
“Had we had the sense not to
list the anti-Communists as
prisoners-of-war, and to let them
out of the camps, there would
have been no problem of
prestige or propaganda involved
in the humane business of
exchanging these prisoners.”
Dominions' Arming.
London “Economist” haying
suggested that the Dominions
should carry a more adequate
share of the rearmament burden,
J. O. N. Perkins, St. Catherine’s
College, Cambridge, wrote retort-
ing that they are already not
doing as badly as represented.
Though Australia, New Zea-
land and the white population of
South Africa (the three evidently
hit at) might well increase their
defence expenditure without
having to go in for British-brand
austerity, certain factors, the
writer contended, should be
taken into the reckoning before
“making crude comparisons”:
“First, the willingness of Aus-
tralia and New Zealand to sell
Britain food at less than world
prices constitutes a very real con-
tribution towards the bearing of
the common burden. Moreover,
it is unlikely that it will be poli-
tically practicable for such con-
tributions to continue unless
public opinion in all three coun-
tries becomes more fully aware
of this fact and believes it to be
the best way of securing the end
in view. More open acknowledg-
ment of this by the United
Kingdom might make the policy
more palatable to electorates in
the Dominions.
“Secondly, the quite excep-
tional rate of investment in Aus-
tralia, on which its immigration
programme depends, would make
it very difficult for it to increase
its defence expenditure greatly
without an intolerable degree of
inflation. If we believe that the
peopling and development of
Australia is a necessary long-
term defence objective of the
Commonwealth, this fact must
surely be taken into account.
“Thirdly, if the food-exporting
countries are to assume a larger
share of the common burden it
seems certain that greater ex-
penditure by them upon increas-
ing food-production (if neces-
sary by subsidising it) is likely
to do more towards strengthen-
ing the defence of the Common-
wealth than the increase in their
armed forces or munitions pro-
duction which would be achieved
for the same expenditure of
resources.”
Cominform Change.
The first objective of the
Cominform was to prevent the
Marshall Plan from succeeding
in Western Europe.
In that (an Edinburgh “Scots-
man” correspondent has noted)
it failed, and “American aid has
at least for the time being put
Western Europe beyond the
reach of Communism.” Hence,
Moscow now puts all its Comin-
form backing into the World
Peace Council.
“So far as Eastern Europe is
concerned, the power of the
Communist police and the close
integration of satellite and Soviet
economies, to the advantage of
the latter, makes the Cominform
superfluous. So far as the rest
of the world is concerned, the
W.P.C. can be relied on to carry
out its work.”
Reporting that the World
Peace Council is making what
amounts to a new “Popular
Front” approach by working to-
gether with pacifists or “neu-
tralists,” the writer concluded:
“Thus the aim of disruption
continues. It is now carried out
in the name of peace instead of
purely in the name of Com-
munism, and its chosen spokes-
men are not party functionaries
but men like M. Cot [one-time
French Minister for Air and
now “one of Moscow’s most
valued instruments”] and the
Dean of Canterbury.”
Labor Likes Them Plain.
Whether this holds good in
Australia may be thought open
to question, but in Britain
(according to “Manchester
Guardian”) the Labor-party
choice is for plain men.
Hence (the “Guardian”
argues) Mr. Bevan is really a
much smaller potato than he
apparently fancies himself:
“The Labor party dislikes
egotists, unless their egotism is,
like Ernest Bevin’s, rather
endearing. It distrusts careerists
and the merely clever. It has
suffered from them. Its deepest
attachments have always been
given to sincere, hard-working
men, not orators perhaps, but
forthright in their beliefs, their
prejudices and their loyalties.
“Mr. Bevan may be applauded
but he is not loved; and the
trade-unions, shrewd judges of
ordinary human nature, distrust
his flashiness and pseudo-
proletarian affectations.
“Nor are the Bevanites them-
selves such as to commend them-
selves to the rank-and-file. They
are nearly all of them of the
cranky end of the party, febrile
and inconstant, chasing after any
new thing.”
Moscow's German Bid.
Bidding higher and higher in
trying to woo Germany away
from the West, Moscow’s latest
proposal is that the Govern-
ment of a united Germany
should control its own national
forces and arms industries, and
should gain free access to the
markets of the East, and perhaps

OtiA ESCALATORS MEAN
MORE TRAFFIC, MORE SALES,
MORE PROFITS . . .
This Otis escalator installation at Mark Foy’s Ltd., Sydney,
makes shopping easier, more enjoyable, by extending an
attractive invitation to visit every department without ettort
and without waiting.
Continuously moving escalators move merchandise because
they cater for people —people who are tired and weary,
people who are impatient, people who are lazy and people
in a genuine hurry.
People plus Otis escalators mean traffic—and traffic in a
store means sales. A survey of your store may provide you
with interesting facts.

to the friendship of Moscow and
Peking, by staying outside the
Atlantic community and
associating with the Communist
community.
“If one asks which groups of
Germans this is intended to
attract,” comments London
“Economist,” “the answer is
quite clear: the men who run
heavy industry now and the
men who would run a new
Wehrmacht later.
“In short, Stalin is returning
from the policy of 1948 to the
policy of 1940; and great must
be the consternation of his
followers, notably in Poland and
France, who have always been
told that the united Germany
they feared would be de-
militarised.
“These are the warming-up
exercises for the kind of somer-
sault that led to the Molotov-
Ribbentrop pact.”
Dragnet Digest.
Three Defence• “Musts.” —
Listed by London “News
Chronicle”: “General Eisen-
hower has said that the capacity
of a country to defend itself is
not the sum but the product of
three factors, the moral, the
physical and the financial. That
is to say, the will to resist, the
capacity to arm and the strength
of economic stability. If any one
of these factors is nil, then the
total is nil. Britain would be a
weak reed indeed as a well-armed
pauper.”
J. Bull on the Land. —J.B. is
so much more familiar as an
industrialist and exporter of the
products of his industries that
some figures given by a London
“Times” special correspondent
are surprising: “Agriculture in
the United Kingdom is still one
of the largest single industries,
and accounts for about 6 per
cent, of the total civil employ-
ment as against a figure of under
4 per cent, for coal and under
2 per cent, for steel, and even in
this highly industrialised country
agriculture still contributes about
5 per cent, of the national
income.”
Dr. Stay-put Adenauer.
Declaring that German Chan-
cellor Adenauer has no intention
of facing elections until the
general elections are due next
year, London “Economist”
mentions a uniqueness of his
position likely to cause envy in
some quarters: “Nothing [it
says] can unseat the Chancellor.
A mere vote of no-confidence in
Dr. Adenauer is not enough ; the
Bundestag must name the
successor it wishes, and the
Chancellor can decide whether
to ask the President to dissolve
Parliament.”
The Several Chinese Wars. —
A New York “Herald Tribune”
writer fails to see how an
armistice in Korea could be con-
cluded with the Peking Govern-
ment as long as the U.S. is com-
mitted to Chiang and the war he
is pledged to wage against that
Government: “Can a war be
halted and can peace negotia-
tions begin on one frontier of
China while wars go on in Indo-
China and in the Formosa
Strait? Maybe such strange
things are possible. But it
seems more likely that the
several Chinese wars will prove
in the end to be inseparable.”
Size of the Navies. —That
notable authority Jane’s Fighting
Ships rates the American Navy
by far the largest in the world,
comprising more than 5000
vessels, including 102 aircraft-
carriers, 15 battleships, 69
cruisers 348 destroyers 263
de and^ er frigates
and 194 submarines. Britain,
next, has 16 carriers, five battle-
ships, 25 cruisers, 95 destroyers,
162 escort vesse s and
and 53 submarines.
Spanish Pride. Spain, a
“New York Times” corres-
S C H
“Die Zeit." British German Zone.
“And now how abhorred in my imagination it is!
My gorge rises at it!”
“Hamlet”: Act V, Scene I.
pondent declares, will not make
political concessions to secure
aid ; indeed “One of the main
sources of Spanish pride is that
this is the only country in
Europe that has managed to get
along so far without American
aid. Without any outside aid, as
a matter of fact, for the strong
cultural and racial interests in
Spain of her Latin-American
cousins stopped short of material
assistance. The popular belief
is that we [U.S.A.] come to them
now because we can’t get along
without their help to round out
the Western security system.”
Wishful - thinkers. The
“Yugoslav Review of Inter-
national Affairs,” which has
some claim to know what it is
talking about on this particular
subject, bluntly debunks hopes
that Moscow will abandon its
aggressive policy; “All those
who think that the Soviet Union
is prepared to change that policy
are completely mistaken. To
abandon it would mean to
endanger the position of the
Russians in their empire.”
N.A.T.O. Objective. —The real
objective of the North Atlantic
Treaty Organisation, as seen by
London “Economist,” is to deter
the Russians not only in 1954,
but in this present year.
Hence, it is just as important—
perhaps more—to have 20 divi-
sions fully equipped this year as
80 divisions in 1954: “In short,
the emphasis in 1952 will be
more on equipping the men
already trained than on raising
new divisions; and this may
throw a heavier burden on
American industry and a slightly
lighter one on European man-
power.”
The Satellites. Summed-up
by a London “Sunday Times”
writer: “These regimes are
tyrannies of the grossest sort.
They are intensely unpopular,
and, if Russian support were
removed, would disappear over-
night”
Russia to Nippon—New York
“Herald Tribune,” not impressed
by Stalin’s apparent friendly
approaches to Japan: “Russia’s
actual conduct toward Japan
has been to insist upon the hang-
ing of Emperor Hirohito, to
withhold thousands of war
prisoners, to seize fishing vessels
and occupy islands; and in
every way possible to obstruct
the return of lapan into the
family of nations through the
shaping of an honorable and
generous peace.”
U.S. Losses in U.N.O. —
Against a tally of American
“gains” in the last U.N.O. yab-
bering, “New York Times” set
up on the debit side: The U.S.
lost ground (a) throughout the
• world, by its insistence, against
the counsel of major allies, on
the election of Greece to the
Security Council; ( b ) in the
Middle East and Latin America,
by adopting a line on member-
ship policy which kept Italy and
Libya out of the U.N.; (c) by
the brusque and uncompromis-
ing manner in which it dealt
with two atomic control pro-
posals submitted by the
Russians.
Barracker for Farouk.
London “Daily Mail’s” veteran
correspondent G. Ward Price
decries what’s no doubt a fairly
common rating: “It is a mistake
to regard Farouk as a playboy
monarch. He is a man of strong
personality and marked mental
ability. The lavishness of his
honeymoon tour was quite in
keeping with Oriental traditions,
and though he resents the merci-
less jeers sometimes levelled at
him from this country [Britain],
he has a well-founded respect
for the British nation, among
whom, as a boy, he was for a
brief time educated.”
Threefold European Army. —
As forecast in London “Sunday
Times” by Sir Charles Webster
(International History professor
and one of the world’s leading
authorities on international
affairs), there’ll probably even-
tually be in Europe a threefold
army representing three definite
political entities: “Europe,” the
Commonwealth (with Scandi-
navian allies) and the United
States, all under the supreme
European Commander of
N.A.T.0.: “The defence of
Western Europe will then be
solidly based on strategic, poli-
tical and economic realities.”
Monarchy with Democracy. —
Neat summing-up by London
“Observer”; “D emocracy
requires a Government which is
not invested with an aura of
sanctity: Ministers who can be
criticised, and dismissed by
popular vote. But that is not
enough. In the collective soul
of the people there is also a deep
craving for a figure who repre-
sents an ideal; an archetypal
figure who, in a phrase originally
legal but with a much wider
significance, must not be
criticised because he ‘can do no
wrong.’ Nor is this merely a
sentimental euphemism; the
Monarch can do no wrong be-
cause, in executive matters, he
does nothing ; it is his Ministers
who act. They rule ; he reigns,”
The Bevanite Delusion.
London Labor “Daily Herald
turns savagely on the breakaway
mob on its own side of the poli-
tical fence: “In spite of what
has happened to Czechoslovakia,
Poland, Hungary, Rumania,
Bulgaria and the Baltic States ;
in spite of Communist actions in
Korea, Malaya and Indo-China ;
in spite of the campaign of
hatred waged by the Kremlin
through every instrument of
publicity at its command —in
blissful disregard of all this
evidence, Mr. Sevan’s group
tells the Western nations they
are rearming on an unjustified
scale. It is difficult to distinguish
between their persuasions and
those we heard in Munich days.”
Rumors of War. —This isn’t
recent, but it has its point: “I
hear new news every day, and
those ordinary rumors of war,
murders, massacres, prodigies,
of towns taken, daily musters
and preparations • . • peace,
leagues, stratagems and fresh
alarums. A vast confusion of
vows, wishes, actions, edicts,
petitions, proclamations, com-
plaints are daily brought to our
ears: treasons, cheating tricks,
enormous villainies in all kinds.”

NEIL MILLAR.
Another Annual Meeting.
It was a good dark night, and
the Garden Pests were holding
their annual convention under
the shelter of a half-grown
cauliflower.
“Well, gentlemen,” said the
Rutherglen Bug, “in formally
declaring this convention open
I would like to say that I think
we can claim, with all modesty,
that during the preceding twelve
months we have more than kept
up those traditions which have
for so long been our proud herit-
age.
“As you know, it hasn’t
always been easy. We have of
necessity suffered casualties, at
times severe. We have had divi-
sions, even corps, of aphides
savagely wiped out, until at
times the situation has appeared
so grim as to raise fears for the
survival of the race —but always,
somehow, a few billion more of
our reserves come to light to fill
the breach.
“In defiance of those Four
Freedoms to which he hypo-
critically gives lip-service, the
despised human who owns —or
thinks he owns —these plants that
give us sustenance has mounted,
with ever-growing ferocity, a
chemical war of extermination
against us. Had it not been that
my sturdy forebears built up,
and passed down to me, a resist-
ance to the ghastly poison
D.D.T., I would not now be
addressing you here. Yet even
now I can’t suppress a revulsion
at sight of an emulsion. None
of us, conscientiously sucking
away at a tomato-plant stem,
can any day be sure that he is
not ingesting at the same time
some frightful new poison, or
that the grapes he is munching
will give him the gripes. Lovers
of peace, we ask nothing more
than to be left to the tranquil
tasks vouchsafed us by nature —
to strip a Brussels-sprout leaf to
the stem, to riddle a potato, to
wither a tomato-plant.
“Sadly we have come to expect
no gratitude for the work we do
—it is notoriously a human’s
worst failing. My own selfless
efforts to save him from develop-
ing a marcel-wave in his spinal
column —which would be his
portion if I were to leave him
any potatoes to dig; my self-
secrifice in gorging myself to
repletion and consequent nausea
on his spinach so as to save
his children from having to eat
so revolting a vegetable; my
maintaining a precarious day-
long grip on a tomato-plant, and
extracting none - too - palatable
juices therefrom so that he won’t
have to waste his time toting his
surplus crop around to neighbors
and friends —uselessly, of course,
for they’d all have surpluses at
the same time—these efforts are
rewarded by bursts of almost
insecticidal fury by a gangster
who at the slightest provocation
sadistically reaches for his spray-
gun.
“Yet we will go on, for we
must go on. Now I, who, as
you know, am one of the big
suckers, as distinct from the
aphides, tomato-mites, thrips
and smaller suckers”
A voice: “You aren’t as big
a sucker as the bloke who is
trying to run this garden!”
“no doubt were I to
reverse the age-old habits of my
kind and start blowing instead of
sucking I should, no doubt,
render myself more favorable
in the eyes of our common
persecutor, so that he might
even come to regard me with
“Have YOU got the toothpaste? Because I’VE got the
burnt sienna!”
affection. But I ask, gentlemen,
where would blowing get me —
where would it get any of us?”
A voice: “That’s right. We
don’t like skites. Let our own
deeds speak for us!”
“Anyway, gentlemen, those are
my sentiments. Well, now that
the convention is officially
opened, general business is in
order,”
The Cutworm heaved himself
up on a couple of dozen legs.
“Mr. Chairman,” he said. “I
have a complaint. This morning
while cutting across one of the
beds I sawed”
A voice: “The higher educa-
tion! He sawed! Speak proper
English, can’t you.”
The Cutworm glared. He
began again. “I sawed”
The Rutherglen Bug held up
a feeler. “All right, all right,”
he said. “Well, what did you
see?”
“I sawed through the stem of
a small Brussels sprout, and
when I felled it I was surprised
to see dozens of green cater-
pillars on the leaves —obviously
left there by the White Cabbage
Moth. This, I claim, is waste-
ful duplication of good destruc-
tive effort. I’ve got more to
do than use my saw on a plant
already doomed. There’s poor
staff-work somewhere. The job
should be left to me—aren’t I
a good feller?”
“I admit you have no lack of
the social virtues—you have
geniality, the gregarious instinct
well developed”
“Aw, can it!” growled the
Cutworm disgustedly, and curled
himself up into a ball.
The Corn Ear Worm spoke
up, “Another thing,” he said
aggressively, “What idiot worked
it out that me and my family
must only hang around the ear-
tips on a cob of sweet-corn?
Some of these humans have
brains almost as good as ours,
and it was a monte one of them
must wake up to it sooner or
later. Only this morning my
missus was sliced in half when
he took the obvious remedy and
cut the ear-tip off. I only saved
myself by a last-second leap.
My domestic affairs are bad
enough without having only
half a missus to look after my-
self and the kids. Why can’t
someone arrange for us corn-ear
worms to operate half-way down
the cob? Not even a gardener
would be galoot enough to cut
his own corn-cob in halves.”
“That would be sheer folly,”
remarked the Potato Moth
blithely,
“My chief complaint,” put in
the Pumpkin Beetle, “is this new
powerful tabloid fertiliser they’re
using on the Queensland Blues.
It’s getting so that even I can't
stop the terrific speed of the
growth. And it’s making my
occupation so hazardous I’m
thinking of claiming danger-
money. Why, only the other
day I hopped on to the tip of a
shoot. Dinkum, the speed must
have been supersonic, for I
didn’t hear a thing. Next thing
I know I’m whizzing between
two palings—the pumpkin was
making for some sunlight on the
other side —and I damn near got
crushed to death,”
“Trouble with you is you’re
yellow,” said the Bean Fly con-
temptuously. “And you whinge
too much. Your job’s not too
dusty.”
“It’s derris-dusty— that’s the
trouble,” replied the P.B. sourly.
Just then another voice broke
in, and everyone looked around,
but the speaker wasn’t visible.
“I’ve been having a hell of a
poor time lately,” it said lugubri-
ously. “You know that my
chief diet is hollyhocks and
plum-trees well, this goat
doesn’t go in for either. I’ve got
to get along on third-rate fodder
like rose-leaves.”
Everyone tipped it was the
Red Spider. “Why don’t y’ get
in front of a magnifying-glass,
Joe, so we can see you?” said
the Vegetable Weevil. “It’s like
having a conversation with a
disembodied spirit. Anyway,
lime-sulphur doesn’t seem to be
affecting your health at all.”
“Aw, it’s all right, but I’d
rather have tobacco-dust. But
we never get that aromatic stuff
now —it was a bonzer flavor.”
Suddenly there came a cry
from the snail and everyone
looked tense. “Uh-huh, it’s on,”
said the Mealy Bug. “ We’re
right; but that torch waving
across the lawn doesn’t look
healthy for at least two dele-
gates. I vote we adjourn and
stay not on the order of our
going, Who’d be slug or snail
on a night like this!”

From whom did Ambrose Palmer
win the Australian middleweight
boxing championship ? Who beat him
for that title, and what other cham-
pionships did Palmer win ? How old
is Palmer, and where is he now ?
Palmer won the Australian middle-
weight championship from Jack
Haines in 1930 and lost it to Fred
Henneberry in 1932. He won the
amateur welterweight championship of
Victoria in 1927, and was beaten by
Dud Barling in the final of the Aus-
tralian welterweight championship at
Sydney Stadium a few months later.
Palmer also claimed the professional
light-heavyweight championship of
Australia, but was never officially
recognised. He won the heavyweight
title from Jack O’Malley in Brisbane
on February 6, 1932, however, and
was never beaten for it before he
retired. Palmer was born at Foots-
cray (Vic.), on September 19, 1911,
and now lives in Melbourne, where
he conducts a gymnasium.

What is the sect called Baha’i?
The Baha’i, or Babi, are followers
of a modern Persian sect founded by
one Mirza Ali Mohammed (born
1819). Their religion is made up of
what they believe to be the best of
the teachings of Mohammedanism,
Christianity and other religions. It
is based on a belief in successive
revelations of the Deity. Man is
regarded as an emanation from God,
and immortal in spirit, but the tenets
of Babiism vary on the question of
individual immortality. Polygamy and
concubinage are forbidden, and
woman is held to be the spiritual
equal of man. There are believed to
be about 700,000 Baha’is in Persia,
with small groups in other parts of
Asia, in Europe and U.S.A. There is
also a small Baha’i community in
Australia and N.Z.
* * * *
In a sentence such as “The finger-
prints were the proof,” should the
verb be singular or plural?
Where subject and object are of
different numbers, it usually makes
for better reading if the verb follows
the number of the subject. “Clouds
are vaporised water,” “The last crop
was potatoes,” but not “Our only
guide were the stars.” Fowler, in
quoting those examples, says: “The
sophisticated man, who thinks of ‘The
wages of sin is death,’ hesitates, but
probably admits that that is an excep-
tion accounted for by the really
singular sense of ‘wages’ (=guerdon).
It may be fairly assumed that when
the subject is a straightforward
singular without complications about
nouns of multitude (as in ‘party’), or
a straightforward plural without com-
plications about a virtually singular
sense (as in ‘wages’), the verb follows
the number of the subject, whatever
that of the complement may be.”

(1) Some information on the
Templars? (2) Is there a modern
order of Templars?
(1) The Templars, or Knights Tem-
plars (also known, among other titles,
as the Brethren of the Temple at
Jerusalem), were a military order of
the Middle Ages, founded in 1118 to
maintain free passage for pilgrims
visiting the Holy Land. At the head
of the order was the grand master,
and each country with a branch was
denoted a province, and presided over
by a resident chief; head province
was Jerusalem. Templars took the
vow of poverty and chastity. Hie
order became one of the wealthiest
and most powerful factors in Euro-
pean politics. In 1312 it was totally
suppressed by the Council of Vienne,
its property confiscated and leaders
tortured, after accusations against it
of heresy, idolatry, unbelief and other
evil practices. The guilt or innocence
of the Templars is still subject of
debate. (2) Neither the Encyclopedia
Britannica nor Everyman’s Encyclo-
pedia (latest editions) makes reference
to there being any modern order.
Brief Answers.
P.M.G.: See article “The Role of
The Bulletin in Indigenous Short-
story Writing During the ’Eighties
and Nineties” printed in “Southerly,”
No. 4, 1950....M.5.: Vitamin E has
been isolated and identified as the
fertility vitamin. Most potent sources
are wheat-germ-oil, cottonseed-oil,
lettuce and green vegetables of the
leaf type, and in food complexes
associated with vitamin A. The
average person possibly obtains a
sufficiency of Vitamin E from an
ordinary mixed diet. Most vitamins
are unstable to heat —cooking of
foods may destroy or reduce their
value. This is especially noted when
food is heated while exposed to air,
as in frying E.W.G.: Dissolve loz.
yellow soap in pints boiling water,
then stir in 1 quart boiled linseed-oil.
When cold, add i pint gold size. The
addition of a little terebine will help
to dry the mixture, but is not neces-
sary. Boiled oil alone will do the
work quite well, but a little copal
varnish or size makes a better finish.
Hang up to dry in a shady, windy
place, and give two coats if necessary.
J.M.: Some very good new
plastic mixtures are on the market,
and these should be investigated. For
a mixture, dissolve loz. yellow soap
in li pints boiling water, then stir in
1 quart boiled linseed-oil. When cold
add i pint gold size. When applying,
keep the cover in a shady, windy
place, and do not allow the sun on
it until thoroughly dry. Two coats
may be necessary on a heavy cover.
.... G.C.: Improbable that mercury
treatment contributes to debility. Test
could be made, but lapse of years
suggests otherwise. Bowel - catarrh
(mucous colitis) tends to recur. See
doctor if anaemia persists. Blood
count advised apart from other tests.
P.B.: (1) For continued use
potassium chlorate not advised as
throat antiseptic. Prescribed dosage
is one tablet (5 grains) dissolved
slowly in mouth, occasionally until
relieved. Much depends upon throat
condition and cause of trouble.
Should not be taken if kidneys are
diseased. (2) Methylated spirit is
usual solvent. Soak and rub lightly,
then rinse in warm water L. 0.:
(1) Agents give no guarantee with
stated depilatory. Cream is for
removal of superfluous or unwanted
hair. See circular. (2) Hydrogen
peroxide is used as hair-bleach.
Dilute (1 in 4) with water, or apply
neat for isolated hairs.

Choosing a Ram.
“Billjim”; When it is con-
sidered that a ram is expected to
impress desirable characteristics
definitely and predominantly on
the lambs of 50 ewes each year
for four years or a little longer,
it is obvious that extra expense
and trouble in securing registered
pure-bred sires of desired type
is warranted.
Considering the value of the
ewes served and the value
of the progeny got over a four-
year period (representing gross
revenue produced with the aid
of the ram) compared with the
possible loss in revenue due
to the ram producing inferior or
fewer lambs, the difference in
cost between a good ram and an
inferior one is much more than
offset.
Rams of uncertain breeding
cannot be expected to give con-
sistent results. Aged rams,
picked up cheaply, even though
of desirable breeding and charac-
teristics, may prove unreliable.
Many ewe flocks from which
fat lambs are produced, especi-
ally the smaller ones, are often
uneven in line. This should be
corrected, but the process may
be gradual because the whole
system of fat-lamb raising
naturally tends towards use of
ewes that have originally been
sorted out in relatively small
lots. This enhances the im-
portance of evening-up their
progeny by using virile and pre-
potent sires.
Faith in Wool.
“Outback”: C. W. Wardlaw,
one of the leading sheepmen in
Texas (U.S.A.), and K. Wilson,
executive head of Forstmann
Woollen Manufacturers, which
produces some of the world’s
finest woollens, who have been
visiting sheep properties in
central-western Queensland, said
in Longreach that there was no
question of synthetics replacing
wool for a long time to come.
They added, however, that last
year’s high prices for wool gave
an enormous impetus to the de-
velopment of synthetics, and the
best guarantee to maintain the
wool market was reasonable
prices. Wilson said that since
the war Australian wool was
finding better acceptance in the
U.S.A., and it rated highly
among manufacturers.
The visitors thought Aus-
tralia could well follow the
United States’ plan for customer
identification of various fabrics
by labels stating the proportions
of wool, cotton and synthetics
used in each. This had been
compulsory in the U.S.A. for 10
years.
Wardlaw’s family controls
300,000 acres, and last year
shore 70,000, sheep. In addition
to producing first-grade wool
from Rambouillet-type Merinos,
they run Angora goats, which,
like the sheep, are shorn twice
yearly, the hair being in demand
by U.S. base heavy-textile manu-
facturers.
Sheep in the U.S.A. produce
an average of 41b. per head at
each shearing, or 81b. per year,
which is close to the average
yield of 8.61 b. per head from
yearly shearings in Queensland.
Rations for Cows.
“Guernsey George”; There
isn’t much point in quoting from
American experiments (B.
26/3/’52) if they are not
applicable. We have no soybean-
meal or sugar-beet pulp, and
timothy-grass is a cold-climate
rather than a warm-climate
grass. Anyhow, our grass is
generally grazed, and thus pro-
vides more protein than stemmy-
grass hay.
The conclusion that home-
grown grains and good legume-
hay render unnecessary the buy-
ing of concentrates is illogical,
because the soybean-meal is the
chief factor in different protein
levels of the various feeds.
That meal would have to be
bought.
What is important to Aus-
tralian dairymen is to determine
to what extent more protein
grown on the farm, either by
way of more clover in the
pasture or by cultivating
leguminous crops for grazing,
can go towards saving the heavy
“ Pocket-knife , mister?”
cash outlay for manufactured
concentrates.
Cattle and Sheep.
“Jubilee”: New Zealand
farmers have run sheep and
cattle together for 50 years. A
sheepfarmer who doesn’t do it
finds worms and other pests
will beat him. Good sub-
divisional fence are a necessity,
so that a paddock which is to
be spelled from sheep can be
sure of no stray in it.
When sheep are treated for
worms or footrot they should be
put on pasture which has been
heavily grazed by cattle, and
cattle should then graze the land
lately vacated by the sheep.
When the paddocks and the
flock have apparently beaten the
pests, sheep and cattle can be
run in the same paddock until,
owing to wet, warm weather, the
pests begin again to multiply.
Under these conditions the
cattle are too valuable as a clean-
ing factor to be used otherwise
than as concentrated cleansers.
Perhaps footrot is so prevalent
in wet weather in Australia be-
cause graziers don’t see that
sheep, after thorough treatment,
should have a guaranteed infec-
tion-free paddock, and not return
to the infected paddock for at
least three weeks.
Conversely, it is found in
N.Z. that dairyfarms carry less
weeds where a few sheep are
kept as cleansers of the dairy-
cow pastures.
Pests of Kurrajong.
“Breck”: The pests most
serious to kurrajong are the
seed-pod weevils, star and twig
psyllids and leaf-rollers. The
seed-pod weevil is a summer
bug which camouflages its
presence by taking the same
color as the bark. The female
bores into the side of the seed-
pod, lays her eggs, and four or
five stout tree-damagers result.
When the adult emerges in the
spring it’s about one-third of an
inch long and dark reddish-
brown in color, and the pod’s
seed-supply is nil. It’s also
found in the fleshy galls or
gnarled growths on twigs.
The two species of Psyllidce
are sometimes known as jumping
plant-lice or lerp insects. Larvae
or adult stages find them piercing
plant tissues and sucking the
sap. The star psyllid lays its
eggs on the leaves. When
groups of 30 or 40 occur, white
starlike filaments spread out on
all sides. Mature insects are
about -gin. long, pale green with
red eyes and have black body
markings.
Bright-yellow eggs of the
twig psyllid are found in
groups at the tips of young
twigs or on the young foliage
between the forks of branch-
lets. Adults, which are less
than iin. long, are yellowish
to reddish-brown, marked black ;
wings are light brown and semi-
opaque. This type clusters
round the twigs in all stages of
development from eggs to adults.
Honey-dew excreted attracts the
ants.
To control any of these pests,
dilute one pint of nicotine
sulphate with one gal. of white-
oil emulsion to 75gal. of water
and spray on to the tree.
Kurrajong leaf-rollers roll
the leaves together with silken
strands. Matted masses are
cylindrical in shape and up
to 9in. long. Larvas an
inch long are dull green with
light-brown bars. Adults are
bright yellow and measure lin.
across the wings, which mostly
carry wavy black bands. If this
insect isn’t dealt with at the
start, heavy leaf losses can result.
Mix of denis or pyre-
thrum powder, l|lb. of soap
and 50gal. of water into an
emulsion and spray regularly for
some weeks.
Growing Mangoes
“P.R.A.N.”: Mangoes can be
successfully propagated by bud-
ding. When the bark will run,
take the selected bud from a
branch a little thicker than the
seedling to which it is to be
attached. Make the opening cut
on the opposite side to the bud
and remove a strip of bark at
least an inch wide. Mark the
width on the seedling and re-
move a strip right round. Now
place the strip of bark with the
bud in its new position, trim-
ming the edges so that it fits
exactly. Cover the joins with
grafting wax and bind to keep
in position. Then, and this is
most important, cut off all leaves
above the bud. Otherwise the
budding will most likely be a
failure.
Food-composition.
“Hortus”; For those who do
not understand food analyses,
a brief explanation may help.
Take peas and beans ; the figures
mentioned first are for peas,
then follow beans: Oil, 1.9 p.c.,
1.65 p.c.; albuminoids, 22 p.c,,
23 p.c.; carbohydrates, 53 p.c.,
51.25 p.c. • fibre, 5.4 p.c., 7.8 p.c.
Oil contains no nitrogen. It
consists of glycerine combined
with fatty acids. Albuminoids
are nitrogenous compounds,
containing roughly 53 p.c.
carbon, 7 p.c. hydrogen, 16 p.c.
nitrogen, 21 p.c. oxygen and
1 p.c. sulphur. They closely
represent similar substances
found in animals’ flesh.
Carbohydrates consist of
carbon combined with hydrogen
and oxygen in the same propor-
tion as found in water (H2G).
Under this heading come starch,
cane-sugar and cellulose.
Peas and beans are foods
fairly rich in albuminoids, but
deficient in oil. You should use
them then to increase the pro-
portion of nitrogenous com-
pounds in a mixed ration. In
this case the substance is mainly
vegetable casein, similar to the
casein of milk. Hence pea-
meal is found in calf-foods and
beans for milking-cows. “Beans
for butter” used to be a common
saying.
If you cannot obtain oil-seed
cakes, which are so valuable for
milk-production, a mixture of
beanmeal plus maizemeal is a
fairly good substitute. The tops
or haulms of peas and beans are
quite nutritious, the analysis
being: Oil, 1.2 p.c., 1.0 p.c.;
alb., 9.5 p.c., 8.3 p.c.; carbohyd.,
33.5 p.c., 32 p.c.; fibre, 34.2 p.c.,
35.2 pc. They are not equal to
clover-hay, but nearly as rich
as good meadow-hay.
(Trace Elements.
“Bass”: Application of 201 b.
of manganese to the acre, in
addition to the usual dressing of
super., has produced a record
crop of potatoes from what was
regarded as worthless ground
near Albany (W.A.). The crop
averaged 15 tons to the acre, as
against a State average of 6.6
tons and a Commonwealth one
of 2.9 tons. Spuds grown on
similar ground but without the
manganese were hardly worth
digging.
The experiment highlights the
part played by trace elements.
The action isn’t always direct,
and the deficiency would often
be unsuspected, even by
the trained observer. Roasted
molybdenite, applied at only
4oz. to the acre, produced a
striking change in clover at
Donnybrook. It was subse-
quently shown that molybdenum
in minute quantities is necessary
to enable the nitrogen-fixing
bacteria to do their work.
Small applications of zinc at
Kendenup have shown good
results on pastures, and copper
has checked cattle diseases. The
manganese effect at Albany could
bring hundreds of acres of peaty
swamp land into production.

THE WEATHER.
By Inigo Jones.
A new southern sunspot group has appeared, has in-
creased in size and is rather complex. This group is rather
close to the solar equator and should be at its active posi-
tion by the time these notes appear, which should mean a
considerable area of rain in eastern Australia and relief in
the north.
Winter rains in the southern States seem likely to occur
in May, but in Centralia the cycle shows some rains from
April to early winter. The first frost of importance is
indicated about the middle of April.

is a good hay wheat in these
areas.
Oats chiefly grown in Vic-
toria are Algerian (54 per cent.).
Orient (14 p.c.) and Algeribee
(13 p.c.). Algerian and its im-
proved selection, Algeribee,
mature late and produce a very
satisfactory oat-milling grain.
They stool better than the early
types. Orient, Dawn and Mulga,
and, in wet districts, recover well
after grazing, providing a hay
or grain crop if normal spring
rains are received.
In the Mallee, however, where
spring rains are uncertain, the
early-maturing Orient, Dawn
and Mulga are preferred.
Varieties recommended by Vic.
Department of Agriculture are;
Wimmera, Mallee and northern
districts: Algeribee, Algerian or
Dawn for general purposes,
Dawn and Mulga for early feed
and early hay, Orient and
Fulghum for grazing. Southern
districts: Algeribee, Algerian or
Dawn for general purposes, Tar-
tarian (white and black types)
for spring sowing in late districts.
Storing Potatoes.
“C.A.A.”; Thorough ripening
of potatoes is essential for good
storage results. Though they
can remain in the soil safely for
some weeks even after the haulms
die down, they are liable to
attack by disease and pests, and
starting of second growth by
early rains.
Don’t lift them before the
haulms begin to turn from green
to yellow and brown. If digging
is done early in the day the
tubers will have a chance to dry
out before night. If moths are
not about the potatoes may
safely be left a day or two on
the surface. Boxes are the best
containers for storing.
Rearing Chickens.
“A-Jay”; Provide food as
soon as the chicks are placed
under the brooder. It takes at
least 24 hours for them to learn
to eat and to distinguish between
food and substances such as
sand and shell-grit.
A large percentage of chicks
are 12 hours old when removed
from the incubator. A further
12 hours may be taken up with
sexing, packing and despatch, so
that the youngest would be 24
hours old when its destination
is reached. Depriving them of
food for a further 24 hours
causes starvation and lowers
resistance to cold and ills.
Thousands of chickens die
through illness brought about by
starvation. The first week is the
most critical period of a
chicken’s life, and a check then
usually results in loss or perman-
ent injury. Continuous dry-
mash feeding plus one or two
feeds of wet mash a day, given
as soon as the chicks are placed
under the brooder, is an insur-
ance against, losses, and pro-
motes rapid growth and develop-
ment.
Mammitls.
“K.T.”: One of the great
causes of mammitis is careless
use of milking-machines. Never
allow the machines to remain on
a cow after milk has ceased to
flow, as the vacuum in the
machine will extend to the in-
side of the teat, possibly break-
ing the lining inside teats and
the lower part of the cow’s
udder. This may do severe
damage to tie tissues. It is
much better to leave a small
amount of milk in the udder
than run t*e risk of permanent
damage P the cows.
When the tissues are injured
mamnhis is almost sure to
occir- Prevention of all types
of njuries to the teats and udders
pies a long way toward avoid-
ing mammitis attacks.
A Garden Hedge.
“Billjim”; Every homestead
should have a hedge. It breaks
the wind, traps dust, keeps the
place cool and beautifies it.
When planting, don’t spoil any
view available from windows
unless shelter is the main con-
sideration.
On poor soils results will be
better if some of the soil is
replaced with loam. See there’s
good drainage. Place each plant
so that the nursery-mark is an
inch below the soil surface. The
plants should be 15in. to 18in.
apart.
Midsummer is the best time
to prune, as it is then that most
new growth has been made. It
will be thicker and easier to con-
trol if cut back severely in the
first few years while being
trimmed into the desired shape.
Hedges do better if the soil is
cultivated to 2ft. on either side.
Occasional top-dressing with
well-rotted animal manure or
fertilisers is beneficial.
Apricot Scab.
“M.”; For scab on apricot
spray the tree with Bordeaux
mixture (6:4:40) just as the last
leaves are falling in late autumn
and again at pink-bud stage
(August). Prepare the spray by
dissolving 11b. of crushed
copper-sulphate crystals in 6gal.
of water. Mix 11b. of hydrated
lime with ygal. of water and
slowly pour the lime solution
into the bluestone solution.
Spray immediately or the mix-
ture will become ineffective.
Hints for the Farm.
“My”: The vegetable garden
will benefit from an autumn-
sown green crop turned under in
early spring before the new
season’s planting. The crop
should include a legume or con-
sist of a legume only, except
where bulk is wanted, say in a
light or sandy soil. Here, a
mixture of barley and field peas
would be better. Sow about loz.
to 2oz. to the square yard, broad-
cast with a similar amount of
super. To get the best out of
the crop, turn it under just as the
legumes are about to flower.
“Billjim”: Oversowing some-
times helps to establish pasture
on hilly country. A good mix-
ture is 11b. of Mt. Barker and
11b. of Tallarook sub. on fertile
soils or those which can be top-
dressed ; on moist soils white
clover at 11b. to 21b. an acre;
Lotus Major at £lb. to 11b. in
shady places and on soils which
don’t dry out too much. Autumn
sowing is the best.
“Sari”: Scours strikes calves
from a day to a month old. It is
easily recognised by the offensive,
blood-rm ge( i motions. Calves
may die within t 2 hours. Actual
cause of scours is uxiknown, but
it is associated with dirty,
draughty pens and so on. Many
remedies exist, but they do not
always work. As soon as calves
go off their milk —a sure sign of
digestive trouble —move them to
new quarters and give each 2oz.
of best castor-oil. Dose them
with care and prevent them
from stretching out on their sides
on the ground, which leads to
pneumonia.
“Sundowner”: In Victoria the
best sowing rate for Italian rye-
grass as a temporary pasture is
301 b. per acre, together with
21b. of white clover or up to
101 b. of cow-grass or Mont-
gomery red clover.
“C.S.”: If a wire fence needs
straining the best way to do it
is to cut the wire halfway be-
tween two strainer-posts and
twitch it up there. This
equalises the strain and gives an
even tension all the way.
“M.T.”: “Kudzu vine is the
most drought-resistant plant
growing on Grafton Experiment
Farm,” said C. E. Collins,
departmental agronomist there.
“The vine has more than proved
its value under the severe
drought conditions prevailing
this season. It has been grazed
off three times, and has shown
great powers of recovery despite
the lack of rain.”


the fire with a huge slice-bar.
Though there was no moving
breath of air down there the
flame from the slush-lamp rose
sideways instead of straight up.
The whole impression was con-
temporary art at its worst —a
dark corner of hell by an artist
with no sense of perspective.
I took a step forward, slipped
on the steel floor-plates and
slithered wildly downhill. Past
Chock’s fire-lit figure I shot,
past two laughing half-seen
demons, to be brought up, com-
pletely submerged in black
water, against the ship’s side.
The water was little more
than waist-deep, I found when
I struggled to my feet. High
above me Chook clung to his
slice-bar and sang “He’s a-slidin’
down the mountain.” He
seemed to find my undignified
arrival highly amusing. So did
the other two, for they
materialised out of the gloom,
still laughing as they extended
shovel-handles towards me,
“Grab a hold,” young Johnny
said. “We’ll pull you out of the
bath.”
I realised then that the pic-
ture wasn’t out of drawing.
Though the water was waist-deep
where I stood the other side of
the stokehold was dry. The only
level thing in this cavern was
the black surface of the water,
the only vertical thing the flame
of the lamp. Everything else
was, of course, leaning steeply
to starboard.
FIRING under those condi-
tions was almost impossible.
Coal dumped on the floor-plates
in front of the furnace immedi-
ately slithered down the slope
and disappeared under water, so
that about one shoveful in every
ten actually reached the furnace.
“Keep this up for another
hour,” Chook said, “and she’ll
turn over with the weight of
coal in her bilge.”
The idea that our efforts were
actually helping to capsize the
ship seemed to amuse him, for
he laughed loudly as the next
lot of coal clattered down the
slope. “Keep ’er goin’,” he
yelled cheerfully. “Won’t be
long now.”
We didn’t “keep ’er goin’.”
West and Butch came through
from the engine-room and called
a halt. We’d have to build a
baulk to keep the coal from
slipping, they decided. And
while we were at it we might as
well build a level staging in front
of the furnace. We got dunnage
from the afterhold and built a
wooden barricade. After shoring
it firmly we shovelled coal
against it and trimmed it off
level. On top of the levelled coal
we laid the widest planks to
form a stage. Provided a heavy
sea didn’t get up all coal passed
from the bunkers would now
stay where it was put, and in
addition the man tending the
furnace could stand in a normal
way. It was after midday when
we finished, and we were starv-
ing ; only too anxious to adopt
West’s suggestion of knocking
off for a meal.
But Butch wouldn’t hear of it.
“That sort of thing might be all
right for flamin’ deck-loafers,”
he declared. “But it won’t do for
the bloody engine-room. Once
we start to raise steam we keep
on with the job. Two men in
the stokehold all the time.”
Chook and I took the first
watch. We knew nothing of
firing, but under Butch’s pro-
fane directions we soon learned.
We learned, too, that on a wind-
less day in the tropics a ship’s
stokehold can be very like hell.
Not the faintest breath of cool-
ing air drifted down the venti-
lator. The sweat poured in
streams down our naked chests
and lodged irritatingly around
our sodden belts. Chook ex-
pressed the opinion that the
water on the floor-plates would
soon be hot enough to boil
spuds in. But we didn’t care.
Our reward was there in the
steadily-rising needle of the
pressure-gauge. When it reached
seventy-five, Butch said, he’d
start the pumps. And with them
going we’d soon have the old
girl on an even keel. That’s
what we thought.
The pumps were going long
before Ben and Johnny came to
relieve us, and the gauge was
nearly up to one hundred.
“Keep her there or bettei;,”
we told them, relaying Butch’s
orders.
For the next twenty-four hours
we kept the pressure up over
the hundred, while Butch tended
the pumps. The work was not
hard. With only one boiler in
operation we were able to take
frequent spells. Certainly the
heat was oppressive, but, then, it
was almost as bad on deck. We
worked watch and watch (four
hours on and four off), ate
scratch meals in the galley and
brewed vast quantities of strong
tea in the stokehold. I don’t
think any of us thought of sleep ;
we were too excited, too
anxiously watching the ship’s
trim as Butch labored to bring
her back to an even keel. There
was a picnic atmosphere about
the whole proceedings, with
West scurrying from deck to
engine-room, taking Soundings,
conferring with Butch, and in
between times snugging down
boat-falls and generally squar-
ing up on deck. When he
brought the Kongyun into port
he meant to have her looking
shipshape in spite of his lack of
crew.
AT four o’clock on the second
afternoon Butch announced
he could do no more with the
trim. He’d pumped most of the
water out of the stokehold, he’d
transferred the fresh water from
the forepeak to the afterpeak,
he’d flooded some ballast-tanks
and emptied others. He’d let as
much water into the afterhold as
he dared, and though he’d got
the propeller under water, the
ship was still down a little by
the head, and she still listed a
full fifteen degrees to starboard.
“I’ve pumped as much water
into her as I have out of her,”
Butch declared. “Any more and
I’ll flamin’ well sink her.”
No amount of pumping could
lower the water in No. 1 hold.
It was a case of proceed in this
trim or abandon her.
We proceeded. The idea of
abandoning her so long as she.
stayed afloat just didn’t enter our
minds. We got the lifeboat up,
though we took the precaution
of keeping her swung out, ready
for instant lowering. We got
steam on the windlass and hove
up the anchor.
And then the telegraph
clanged as West moved the
pointer to “Full Ahead.” We
were off! Johnny was at the
wheel, Ben was supposed to be
resting and Chook and I were
back in the stokehold. Butch
had warned us that with only
one boiler in operation he’d need
all the steam we could give him.
We gave him everything. When
the telegraph rang we had the
needle quivering on one hundred
and fifty, her safety limit,
Down there in that hot,
gloomy cavern we heard the hiss
and thump of the main engines
as Butch opened them up, and
we cheered. Chook hurled a
few shovels of coal into the
furnace, slammed the door shut
and sang “We’re Off to See the
Wizard,” at the same time exe-
cuting a few ridiculous dance-
steps on the wooden platform.
We were exultant, confident in
our ability to maintain the pres-
sure and bring the Kongyun
steaming triumphantly, magnifi-
cently into port. Little did we
know that, no matter how we
toiled, sweated and cursed we
would never again see that
needle climb to its present
height. So far we’d only had
the pumps to contend with, but
now the main engines ate the
steam up as fast as we could
make it —faster in fact. The
cursed things were insatiable.
UP on deck West was having
his share of trouble. As the
Kongyun gathered headway it
became increasingly obvious that
young Johnny couldn’t steer her.
He kept spinning the wheel, first
one way and then the other, till
the steam steering-gear was one
continuous chatter and hiss of
steam —our precious, hard-won
steam. And in spite of his
efforts the Kongyun went her
own way, swinging her bows
wildly in an arc of more than
forty-five degrees.
West pleaded with Johnny and
abused him alternately. Finally
he pushed the kid aside and took
the wheel himself. It made no
difference. The ship was out of
trim, she was down by the head,
listing badly, and she was sulky.
She sheered wildly against her
helm and progressed in a series
of zigzags as if trying to evade
a bombing attack.
West accepted the inevitable.
“Do your best,” he said, hand-
ing over to Johnny. “Pity it
isn’t war-time. They’d never
hit her.”
He called a hasty conference,
then, leaving Johnny alone at
the wheel while he brought Ben
and Butch into the stokehold.
That conference is worth record-
ing, because it showed up the
cheerful irresponsibility of
West’s nature, indeed of all our
natures. Butch had started the
dynamo, so that we had electric-
light down there instead of the
feeble slush-lamp. The single
bulb did little to dispel the deep
gloom of the place, but at least
we could see each other.
West mentioned, quite
casually, that the Kongyun
wasn’t steering too well. What
a vast understatement that was!
He estimated our speed at be-
tween five and six knots ; which
meant under twenty hours’
steaming to Dili, in Timor. The
disadvantages of putting in there,
or into any of the closer ports,
he pointed out, were obvious.
All were in Dutch territory. We
might be held in any one of
those ports for months, waiting
for our salvage claims to be
heard. Being unable to speak
the language would be a further
handicap.
On the other hand, we could
make Darwin in five days or less
if the weather held fine. And
in Darwin our claim would be
heard by our own people, with
the company’s agent looking
after our interests. In his opinion
the ship was seaworthy provided
we didn’t run into really heavy
weather —a very remote possi-
bility at this time of the year.
However, it was up to us. What
did we think?
What did we think! We
didn’t have enough brains to
think or we’d have howled him
down. Without hesitation we
declared for Darwin, ignoring
the risks, the discomforts and
the back-breaking toil it would
entail. We could see the news-
paper headlines —“ Epic Salvage
Feat. Six intrepid young British
seamen bring disabled steamer
into Australian port”
Six ignorant fools!
The whole idea was mad. It
was inexcusable, utterly fan-
tastic, But it was the sort of
thing you’d expect from a team
such as ours. We were so young
and inexperienced. All told, I
doubt if we mustered as much
sober judgment as one seasoned
old shellback.
We could have taken the
Kongyun to Dili, we could have
taken her to Koepang, through
the Alor Straits, and in sheltered
water all the way. We could
have beached her anywhere and
let the experts take over. Yet
we chose Darwin, across four
hundred miles of open sea. West
should have known better. Per-
haps he was influenced by the
fact that he had a girl—a red-
headed nursing sister —in Dar-
win. I don’t know, and at the
time I didn’t care.
WE zigzagged through the
Wetar Straits and took our
departure from Cape Sewirawa
on the coast of Timor. Ahead
of us lay the Timor Sea, glass-
calm, open and inviting. Beyond
that lay Darwin.
With his usual optimism, West
had overestimated our speed.
We may have been making five
knots through the water, but
owing to our erratic steering our
actual rate of progress was only
four knots, in spite of our best
stoking efforts.
There is a clause in our
articles which says that seamen
and firemen are to assist each
other to work the ship in cases
of emergency. As far as we were
concerned the clause was super-
fluous, for each one of us was
both seaman and fireman. We
worked that ship together in one
ceaseless round of alternating
duties. When we staggered up
from the stokehold one man im-
mediately relieved the wheel
while the other ate and rested,
if he could. West did the navi-
gation and took his turn at the
wheel and in the stokehold.
There was only one man on the
bridge at a time —one man com-
bining the duties of helmsman,
otficer-of-the-watch and look-
out. If he wanted West for any-
thing he jangled the telegraph
three times. Fortunately, the
wheel was on the open bridge, so
that the helmsman had a good
view from right ahead to abeam.
Aft of that his vision was
obscured.
Butch, of course, took no part
in our routine. He lived in the
engine-room with an oilcan in
one hand and a lump of cotton-
waste in the other. Occasionally
he came through to the stoke-
hold to check up and advise us.
He ate in the engine-room, and
if he slept at all he merely dozed
down there, still clutching his
oilcan. And each time he visited
us he pleaded for more steam.
Steam! Day and night we
could think of little else. The
needle of the pressure-gauge be-
came the symbol of our lives.
In our rare snatches of sleep
we dreamed of that needle
falling and falling, so that, as
Chook said, “A man might as
well be down below trying to
shove the damn thing up as
lying in bed letting it beat him.”
We were so steam-conscious that
the man at the wheel thought of
each wild swing of the ship’s
head only as so much steam
necessary to bring her back on
her course again. We begrudged
the electric-light burning above
us in the stokehold, and would
have gone back to the feeble
slush-lamp had not Butch
scotched the idea. He needed
light, and plenty of it, in the
engine-room, he said. Besides,
current was necessary for the
navigation-lights at night.
We shovelled coal till our
hands were covered with blisters.
Then the blisters broke, leaving
such great raw patches that we
fought shy of the spokes when
we had to take the wheel, pre-
ferring to use the heels of our
hands, our wrists and even our
elbows—anything to dodge the
searing pain of raw flesh against
wood.
We ate scratch meals when
and where we could. We slept,
in our rare off-duty intervals, on
the nearest bunk, regardless of
the sweat stuns and coal
smudges left hj the previous
occupant. Night or day no man
wore anything bu a pair of
shorts. Occasionally we scooped
up a bucket of seawater and
dumped it over God
knows, our starboarded was
close enough to it. Thv salt-
water did nothing to cleat us>
It merely drove the coal grrne
deeper into our skins, so that w>
must have looked like a gang ot
Lascars. What was the use of
wasting precious time in bathing
when another two hours would
see us down that hell-hole
again?
But worst of all was the list,
that maddeningly uncomfortable
lean to starboard. Everything
moveable slid into the starboard
scuppers. A cup or a plate
unthinkingly placed on a table
immediately slithered down the
slope and crashed. The star-
board side of the galley floor
was littered with broken
crockery, victims of the law of
gravity. We moved crabwise
about the sloping decks, slipping,
grabbing for support and always
leaning to one side or the other.
Movement was so difficult that
we almost welcomed each return
to the stokehold, where, at least,
we were on a level footing.
Don’t think we were de-
pressed. Tired, dirty and sore
as we were, we wouldn’t hav«
changed places with the pam-
pered passengers of a luxury
liner. The gods were smiling
on us. The sea remained flat
calm, a vast expanse of shining
blue ocean, disturbed only by
our zigzag wake. Each day the
sun shone out of a cloudless sky.
We were buoyed up with our
success, confident of victory and
blissfully unaware of the danger
of our mad venture. Long ago
Butch had discarded his life-
belt, declaring that he was
damned if he was going to lug
the cursed thing about with him.
“If the old tub goes down
while I’m in the shaft-tunnel,”
he reasoned, “what flamin’ use
will a lifebelt be to me?”
Noon. Thursday, ?th.
I can still see that entry in
the log, smudged from West’s
coal-grimed hand. We were over
the halfway mark then. One hun-
dred and eighty miles, only forty-
five hours’ steaming from Dar-
win. Chook sang all through
our watch in the stokehold.
“Boy!” he said, running a
pink tongue over his coal-
blackened lips. “Will Igo for
the beer in a big way when we
get the pick down!” He was
still singing when he went up to
relieve West at the wheel.
An hour later, while he was
trying himself out with some
operatic stuff, the hoarse blast
of a siren scared seven bells out
of him. He looked out to star-
board and saw the trim grey
bow of a sloop sliding up,
scarcely more than her own
length away. Seamen lined her
rail, and on her bridge stood a
group of white-clad officers.
“Hey!” Chook yelled, spin-
ning the wheel to port. “What
the ’ell are y’ cornin’ at? Ain’t
the —— ocean big enough for
you?”
He was badly rattled, first by
the blast of the siren and then
by the unexpected closeness of
the sloop.
Apparently his indignant out-
burst didn’t carry as far as the
sloop’s bridge, for one of her
officers raised a megaphone and
called:
“Ahoy, there! You, Abdul.
You savvy English?”
I don’t think Chook realised
how black he was. Perhaps he
forgot it in the heat of the
moment, for he bellowed:
“Of course I well savvy
English. What the ’ell d’ y’
expect a man to talk? Chinese?”
It didn’t occur to him that
Chinese might be the very
language to be expected from a
ship with the name of Kongyun.
“Why didn’t you answer our
signals?” the officer called. “I’ve
been asking you if you are in
trouble.”
“Of course I’m in trouble.”
Frantically Chook strove to
check one of the Kongyun’s
wild starboard swings. “I was
flat-out tryin’ to keep this cow
from rammin’ ’erself. And now
you come along. Can’t y’
move over? Ain’t there any
room out there to starb’d?”
Realising that he wasn’t mak-
ing much headway, the officer
asked to speak to the captain,
“ ’Ang on a minute,” Chook
said, and jangled the telegraph
three times.
West came up immediately. If
x e was astonished to see the
s i<op so close to him he didn’t
shov it, for he paused on the
lower and called:
“Whae s the trouble?”
The cbsardity of such a query
from a siajp j n our condition to
a trim, unit of her
Majesty’s Na,y inust have struck
every man in tht sloop, for a
ripple of laughu r j. asse d down
her grey length.
“I want to speak ‘■<3 your cap-
tain,” the megaphone Elated.
“Right-oh. You’re to
him.” . £ L .
Several pairs of binoculars
were raised to study the half-
naked, wholly black figure wh*
claimed to be the captain.
“I’ve been trying \o find if
you want any assistant." Sud-
denly the tone of he voiw
changed. “I say, old chap, if
you really are the captan, would
you mind stopping yur ship


before that infernal idiot on your
bridge rams us?”
West called “Stop her,
Chook,” and laughed. “It’s not
his fault,” he explained. “The
bitch of a thing won’t steer.
She’s half-full of water. Salvage
job.”
Very feelingly the commander
said “I’ll say she’s a salvage job.
Looks more like a total wreck to
_ 95
me.
With the Kongyun stopped
and no longer threatening to
charge into her sleek visitor,
conversation became easier. The
sloop’s commander was a decent
bloke. When he heard that there
were only six of us he offered
to send some of his men aboard.
He said he’d stand by us till we
made port, and even suggested
towing us. But West declined
all his offers.
“We’ll be right, thanks,” he
assured him. “We’ve brought
her this far, and we’ll get her
the rest of the way.”
The commander promised to
report us in Darwin, and added
“You’re sure you wouldn’t like
me to stand by you? Looks like
a bit of weather coming up
astern, and you’re in no shape
to stand up to a blow.”
“Thanks, commander, we’ll
make it.”
I knew what West was think-
ing—that if we accepted help
from these people they would
be entitled to a share of the sal-
vage money. A big share. Wel-
come as their assistance would
be, we could get along without
it. And I agreed with him, in
spite of the cloud-bank astern.
If it blew from that quarter it
would only blow us more
quickly into port. What colossal
youthful ignorance!
The sloop gathered headway.
The officers on her bridge took
off their caps and waved to us.
And do you know what they did
—they and the men lining her
rail? They gave us three rousing
cheers.
We should have seen our ship
through their eyes then—as a
listing hulk that any sane crew
would have abandoned or
beached on the nearest bit of
land. But we didn’t. She was
our ship. We six had got her
this far, and come hell or high
water we’d get her the rest of
the way.
IT started to blow that night.
* Nothing much, but it kicked
up a short following sea. Long
before daylight the Kongyun
was wallowing with a slow
stately roll. Down in the stoke-
hold the motion was not alarm-
ing. Perhaps Chook and I were
too busy trying to keep the
needle of the pressure-gauge at
a respectable height to really
notice anything amiss, for we
were surprised when Ben and
Johnny came down to relieve us
and Johnny said in awe-struck
tones:
“Do you think we’ll make it?
She’s nearly going over every
time.”
It was my wheel, and as I
groped my way forward along
the dark deck I saw he was
right. She didn’t go very far
over to port, but on the star-
board roll she lay over till the
gleaming phosphoresence of the
wave-tops creamed over her bul-
warks. When I relieved West at
the wheel he said:
“I dunno how much further
she can go without turning over.
Not far. I’d say, I’m going
down to lend a hand below.
The sooner we get this hooker
into calm water the better.”
And for the first time since I’d
cilmbed aboard I wondered if
we ever would get her into port.
Daylight broke over a con-
fused, choppy sea. It was com-
ing from dead astern, and it
wasn’t a big sea. In the Nether-
dale it wouldn’t even have been
uncomfortable, but in the list-
ing Kongyun it was frightening.
She scooped so much water in
over her starboard bulwarks and
lay over there so long that I
feared each roll would be her
last. Strangely enough, she was
steering easily now, scarcely
attempting to swing. I suppose
there had to be one bright spot.
I didn’t think of rest that
morning. When Chook relieved
me I went straight below to help
with the stoking. Steam was
what we wanted, now more
than ever. More steam to give
us more speed. We needed no
telling, no urging to greater
efforts. West went back to the
wheel and Chook rejoined us.
No one said anything, but we
all realised that from now on
there would be no more reliefs.
West would stay at the wheel
and we’d stay in the stokehold
till we reached port —or sank.
With four of us on the
shovels we were able to pass
extra coal from the bunkers and
build a sizeable stockpile in
front of the furnace. Better
still, the needle of the pressure-
gauge began to rise.
Because he was the youngest
and weakest of our gang, we
detailed Johnny off as mess-boy.
We had to eat, even if we
couldn’t rest. Johnny fed West
at the wheel and brought food
to us in the stokehold. Un-
washed, filthy with coal-dust and
sweat, we wolfed it down and
went back to our shovelling.
There was no picnic atmosphere
now. No longer were we care-
free and overconfident. We
were working frantically to save
“Hang on, dear — We'll soon be out of this ant-hill
country."
our lives, fully aware of the fact
that if the ship rolled over we
would be trapped down there
like rats in a flooded sewer.
We lost all sense of time. In
that dark hole day was indis-
tinguishable from night. The
only thing that counted with
us was the pressure-gauge; and
it was still rising, slowly but
surely. Once Johnny came
down with word from West,
telling us that we were doing
better than five knots. He also
informed us that the sea was
getting worse. We didn’t even
answer him.
Long ago we had sensed the
rising sea in the ship’s move-
ments, in the way she hung on
that hellish starboard roll, lying
there as if unwilling to ever
come back. When she did re-
cover she came up sluggishly,
fighting every inch of the way
till she reached the perpen-
dicular. We could feel the ever-
increasing lurch to port, too, and
we knew the cause of it.
Through the bulkhead be-
tween us and the flooded No. 1
hold we could hear the suck and
swish of the water surging from
side to side. To a seaman the
crash of seas against his ship’s
hull is nothing more than a part
of his everyday life. The water
is where it should be —outside
the ship. But the sound of
water roaring and swirling
inside the ship is terrifying. If
that bulkhead collapsed. . .
Hell, what difference would
it make to us whether the bulk-
head went or the ship rolled
right over? In either case we
would be boiled first and then
drowned. Why think about
things we couldn’t control?
THE needle of the pressure-
gauge rose up and up.
Butch came through to remind
us about drawing the ashes. His
ugly face spread into a grin
when he saw the needle quiver-
ing on the 120.
“Keep ’er going, boys,” he
said. “Won’t be long now.”
This time we didn’t waste our
energy hauling the ashes up and
dumping them. We let them
slide down the starboard slope,
where they spat and sizzled
themselves out in the swirling
bilge-water. Was it our imagina-
tion, or was that water-level
rising? We put the thought
aside and toiled on, striving to
retain some sort of balance
against the terrific lurching. And
always the needle climbed, up
and up.
“One hundred and thirty-
bloody-five,” Chook announced,
slamming the furnace-door shut
and reaching for the tea-billy.
“Keep it up, you little beaut,”
he could no longer sing, but he
was still cheerful.
The ship lurched heavily to
starboard. No sluggish roll this,
but a vicious lurch that carried
her down and down till she was
almost on her beam-ends. The
billy fell from Chook’s hands
and clattered down the slope. I
remember clutching at the
staging and thinking “God, this
is it. She’ll never come back
this time.”
But she did. Slowly, reluc-
tantly, inch by inch she dragged
herself upright. Then, with a
roar of water behind the bulk-
head she tumbled over to port.
Over she went, carrying our
precious heap of coal with her.
Over till an avalanche of water,
ashes and coal from the star-
board bilge crashed across the
floor-plates, sweeping us and
our staging ahead of it in a mad
downhill rush to port.
Half-drowned, battered almost
insensible by planks and coal,
we struggled to our feet.
Amazingly the ship was still
afloat. She still rolled with the
same maddeningly sluggish
motion, only now everything was
reversed. Instead of listing to
starboard she now carried a
permanent port list.
As far as we could tell the
ship herself was in no worse
trim than she had been before
the changeover. Unfortunately,
the position in the stokehold
was infinitely worse. Our stock-
pile of ready coal was gone,
mixed with the ashes and sea-
water in the port bilge. Our
staging was completely wrecked
and we were battered, bruised
and beaten. Without the stag-
ing we could not hope to main-
tain the pressure. Without pres-
sure we would come gradually
to a stop, drift broadside-on to
the seas and sink; for if she
rolled like this in a following
sea she would assuredly roll right
over when she got it on the
beam. We just stood there,
knee-deep in swirling black
water, balancing ourselves
against the hellish rolling. And
each one of us was thinking
“Why keep it up? Let’s take to
the lifeboat and let the old
bitch sink.”
SOMEONE called anxiously:
“You chaps all right?” and
we looked up and saw West. He
grinned when he saw the three
of us scrambling up the slope
towards him. His left arm, we
noticed, dangled stupidly, swing-
ing like a pendulum to the
motion of the ship. Broken
above the elbow, he explained,
almost too casually. The roll to
port had caught him off-balance
and he’d been hurled the full
length of the bridge. It was
nothing. The really serious
thing was the loss of the life-
boat. Yes, it was a complete
write-off. Hard to say how it
happened; it was pitch-dark up
top, raining, too. In any case,
he couldn’t leave the wheel to
investigate till Johnny arrived.
Yes, Johnny was safe. At the
wheel now, scared stiff, but keep-
ing the old girl right on her
course.
West looked us over hope-
fully. In the dim light I sup-
pose we looked sound enough ;
and miraculously we still
grasped our shovels. Heaven
alone knows how we’d managed
to retain them through that
awful mix-up. Did we think
we could keep steam up? he
asked. If so he’d go back to
the wheel and send Johnny down
to help us. If not —well, there
was a raft up top. We could
take to it and chance being
washed ashore. He wasn't sure
of our position, but land
couldn’t be too far off. When
daylight came we should be in
sight of it —if it wasn’t raining
too hard. And even if our raft
didn’t get washed ashore, we
were sure to be picked up. The
sloop was in Darwin, and she’d
be certain to start searching for
us when the Kongyun didn’t
show up.
At the mention of the sloop
we rallied. She had given us
three rousing cheers as she
steamed away. What fools we’d
look if she came out and picked
us up clinging to a raft! Not
even our lifeboat saved!
“We’ll stay with ’er.” Chook
made the decision for all of us,
knowing that we felt as he did.
If West could go up top and
take the wheel with one broken
arm, then we could stay down
here and do our best to keep
steam up.
We pushed West’s arm down
inside the waistband of his
trousers and tightened his belt
to hold it firm. It was all we
could do. The cursed needle
was falling, reminding us that
somehow or other we must get
coal into the furnace.
Johnny came down and we
four toiled through the night.
Only a trapeze-artist could have
balanced on that reeling slope
and tossed each shovelful of
coal through the furnace-door.
We felt we were doing well if
one in three hit the mark. More
often than not the coal hit the
boiler-plates and clattered down
the slope to join the ever-
growing pile to port. Sometimes
we slid down after it.
We knew it was night, because
Butch told us the time when he
came through to help us clear
the ashes at midnight. There
was a certain fatalistic resigna-
tion about the way we worked
now. We felt that every lump
of coal that missed its mark,
every glowing clinker we with-
drew, was helping to seal our
doom as it slithered down to
add its weight to the heap in
our port bilge.
No one looked at the pres-
sure-gauge any more. We knew
it was falling, just as we knew
we could do no more to stop
it. We shovelled and we
cursed. Cursed the list, the
awful rolling and our own
clumsiness. At best our curses
were feeble, half-hearted utter-
ances. Finally they ceased alto-
gether. We needed every ounce
of our remaining strength to
appease the flaming monster
that cried continuously for coal
and more coal.
BY refusing to look at the
gauge we had merely cast
aside one god and set up
another —a blazing fire-god that
devoured all we could toss to it
and hungrily licked its lips for
more. The gauge, coldly im-
personal, had merely demanded
physical effort. But to our over-
wrought nerves this new fire-
god seemed to glare at us with
a baleful hungry stare, demand-
ing the last thing we had to give
it —human sacrifice.
Well, it got it. Johnny was
the first victim. He collapsed
against the bunker-door, sobbing
the great gasping, pitiful sobs
of a man who has gone beyond
the limits of physical endurance.
His eyes stared wildly at the
open furnace and his hands
were locked so firmly around
his shovel - handle that we
couldn’t prise them open. Poor
kid ; he was the youngest and
weakest of us all, and, like the
rest of us, he hadn’t had one
really substantial meal or any
proper rest for six days.
We dragged him aside. He
was in our way there. We
dragged him into the dark
bunker and propped him, still
fiercely clutching his shovel,
against a pile of coal. There
was nothing more we could do.
We toiled on. Johnny re-
joined us, full of stumbling
apologies, but we refused to let
him do any more shovelling.
“Go up and give West a
hand,” I ordered, hoping the
cool air on deck would help to
revive him.
We carried on with the job.
We must have, for at 11.15 on
the morning of the ninth we
dropped anchor in Darwin har-
bor. West’s grimy last entry in
the log says so, though for all I
knew or cared we might have
been in Hong Kong, or mid-
ocean.
THE pilot-launch came out to
meet us, West says, but the
pilot wouldn’t come aboard. I
don’t blame him. I think he
showed good judgment in refus-.
ing to risk his life. After order-
ing West to follow him he led
the way to a shallow patch
where the Kongyun could sit
comfortably on the bottom at
low-water. We were scarcely
making steerage-way. In fact,
Johnny swears we had come to
a stop before he went forward
to let go the anchor, though the
telegraph was still standing at
“Full Ahead.”
So much for our triumphant,
glorious arrival as heroes of an
epic salvage feat!
Ben was out to it, the fire-
god’s victim Number Two. Chook
and I were moving, though not
really conscious of movement.
We didn’t even realise that we
were in calm water. The clang-
ing of the telegraph as West
rang-off the engines didn’t
register on our numbed brains,
nor did the faint rumbling
tremor of the anchor-cable run-
ning out. If we heard that
rumble our subconscious minds
put it down to the turmoil of
swirling water behind the bulk-
head, a sound we had long ago
accepted as part of our exist-
ence.
Butch, a hideous apparition
with red-rimmed eyes peering
out of a black face, came
through from the engine-room.
“Lay off it, boys,” he said.
“We’re in. Anchored in Darwin
harbor.”
Chock’s shovel clattered to
the floor. He gasped stupidly:
“Well, y’ wouldn’t read about
it,” and slid down the slope,
coming to rest against the pile
of ashes and coal.
I joined him. With my head
resting on the lovely soft pillow
of his sweating belly and black
water lapping soothingly about
my legs I heard Butch say
“Come out of it, you bloody
fools. When the pumps stop
you’ll drown.” Then he, too,
joined us.
Above his snoring Chook’s
voice croaked hoarsely “There’s
no place like home” —actually
trying to sing! And after a
moment; “Is there?”


THE OTHER FELLOW'S MIND
New Stamps
Add to Sydney’s many rackets the
trafficking in new-issue postage-stamps
For instance, imprint-blocks (that block
of four directly over the printer’s imprint
on the selvedge forming one corner of
each sheet of stamps and prized by col-
lectors) of the new Is. brown can’t
be purchased for love or money in the
normal way at face-value over post-
office counters in Sydney metro-
politan area —they are being system-
atically “cornered” and sold to
dealers in quantities for a consideration.
Dealers in turn sell the blocks to col-
lectors at further inflated rates.
Neither the sellers at G.P.O. counters
nor suburban post-office staffs are to
blame—sheets are arriving for sale at
counters and offices with the imprints
detached, the total value of each muti-
lated sheet being made up with four loose
stamps. But someone, somewhere, is
reaping a harvest with this particular
issue, as has been done with other issues
in the past.
Incidentally, since the official announce-
ment that the current brown (or
grey) would be replaced with a green after
April 9, imprint-blocks of the former also
have disappeared from post-office
counters as if by magic.— Postscript
(N.S.W.).
Farm-workers’ Hours
A problem for most farmers is that few
workers will overexert themselves in busy
farm periods, while the majority will take
it easy when things are slack.
There are a few exceptions, mostly
country-bred. My friend has one. When
seeding is being done the sun sets on
them at work, and rises to a day’s labor
well begun. In the off-season it’s dif-
ferent. The worker takes a day off in
town when he wants to, and on occasions
both knock off early to drag a net for
fish in the river. All in all it averages out
and both are well content.
Came a city-slick on holiday during
seeding-time. He spotted the farmhand
coming in at dusk. Cornering him, he
gave a long discourse on “hard-won con-
ditions,” “sweated labor” and the “neces-
sity for strict hours.”
The countryman listened in silence,
then slowly removed his pipe and replied
with infinite wisdom: “Ar, mate. You
don’t understand. You just don’t under-
stand.”—B. J. L. (Q.).
Leaving the Land
One of the troubles with the land has
been the failure by authority to recognise
the resident landholder’s need of secure
living-room for himself and his family.
This has driven many away to the city.
Why should the sons or daughters
of small holders remain in rural
areas, living in sub-standard conditions,
to work for the purchasers of adjacent
properties who take no interest in the
social life of the area?
That is what has driven families to
leave the land in my locality. Each old
friend in a small community who has sold
out has put his property in the hands of
a stock-salesman, who sells to the most
convenient buyer for himself, with no
regard for the local situation. The trans-
fer of the title is made with Lands
Department approval to someone with no
interest other than as an investment, and
who probably asks the resident family
to “keep an eye” on his place. Repeat
that a few times in a small cqmmunity
and social life is wrecked, progress halted
and the rot sets in.
There can be no legitimate complaint
against the new owner—he is probably a
most estimable citizen —but that does not
compensate the resident for his loss of a
friend, or his family for the loss of a
material portion of their social circle.
Appeals against transfer of land on the
ground of lack of opportunity to purchase
by residents with small holdings have not
been upheld, and, such being the case,
there is nothing else but to leave the
land.
It has been suggested that residents
with holdings smaller than a recog-
nised living space should have the right
to buy land in their districts within a
month of an arranged sale to a non-
resident, but the authorities will have
none of it. In the mirantime the non-
resident holder groans under the burden
of taxation and, in some cases at least,
does not use the property to its maxi-
mum productivity.
The small holder leaves because,
crushed between the rising costs of pro-
duction and the need for more finance to
allow his son to settle on the home block
—which will not carry two families, any-
how, but which is beyond his capacity to
work singlehanded—he must get out,
swelling the ranks in the city, leaving his
land to the indifferent care of others and
sinking his knowledge of its needs in the
suburban back-street. — Scrubber (S.A.).
Falling Production
It should be apparent to everyone that
the only way to step-up food-produc-
tion, or any kind of production, is to
remove all forms of political strangula-
tion, now perilously close to Communism
even if disguised by other names. We
have a hundred and one boards,
with their hosts of administrators
and political numbskulls. We see
them issuing edicts, threats, regulations
and notifications of what the producer
must do with his own property. At no
stage do these city farmers contribute one
ounce of labor in production or one frac-
tion of the cost.
As well as having to support these
growths, we have to bolster-up and sup-
port an ever-increasing Socialistic scheme
of Governmental control of railways,
post-offices and all forms of transport.
The costs of these services continue to
".. .and come out fighting!”
rise, while the services themselves plunge
further into debt.
Then we have the taxgatherer acting on
the idea that production above a certain
limit is criminal and that all earnings
above such limit must be taken away.
Coming in at the death are the unions,
with their continual demands for higher
wages and greater amenities and less
work. How can a community carry such
burdens?
By lending farmers money on long
terms at low interest to build homes for
employees, by scrapping the many food-
boards that are strangling food-produc-
tion, by a worth-while reduction of rail
freights to cheapen transport in country
areas, and by providing more, better and
cheaper postal services, the Government
would be getting somewhere. Bringing
hordes of migrants into Australia to house
and feed when we are nearing the stage
where we won’t be able to feed or house
ourselves is sheer madness. — Farmer
(N.S.W.).
Life Assurance and Inflation
The many thousands of retired busi-
nessmen and others on fixed-pension
incomes will not be impressed by J. Mc-
Tigue’s assurance (B. 19/3/’52) that infla-
tion has resulted in their having “an
increased earning potential.” The fact,
of course, is that they have no earning
potential whatever.
Why it should be assumed that all
policyholders are possessed of cars, houses
and furniture is beyond me. In fact,
many are borrowing on existing policies,
and in view of their age and shrinking
incomes pious exhortation to double
their life-assurance cover is just so much
tripe. Many bank officials and the like
put all their faith in pension schemes
and life assurance, and there were no
“overs” from their salaries to buy cars
and houses.
They are the people who are getting it
fair in the neck with inflation. No
periodical basic-wage adjustments, etc.,
for them, with which to take out more
assurance, even if their age still admitted
of a bit more. The cruel part of it is that
they paid the premiums over a long term
of years—not in part-good and part-“bad”
money, as “J.McT.” seems to think, but
all in good money with real purchasing-
power.
Never since Australia was a pup has
there been anything approaching the
present inflation. Compared with a long-
term life-assurance contract, the inflation
is of comparatively recent growth. As for
its being absurd to compare it with the
German inflation after 1918,1 don’t know
so much about that. A comparison can
be made. Germany went the whole hog
and we have gone about two-thirds.
Never in the history of the world has an
unbacked paper currency failed to reach
zero, so perhaps the end is not yet.
“J.McT.’s” panegyric on Australian
life-offices may be merited, but that has
nothing to do with the futility of societies
sending out letters to all and sundry urg-
ing increased cover. In many such cases
the existence of a husband’s life-policy
will merely result in debarring the widow
from social-security benefits of a value
much in excess of what the proceeds of
the policy would return if safely invested.
The old reluctance to “take the pension”
has very largely disappeared now that all
are contributing to it in taxes. The huge
total of “surrenders” might therefore
suggest that many policyholders are
awake to this, and cashing their policies
and using the proceeds while both
husband and wife are alive and able to
enjoy them. — Ceg (Vic.).
N.T. Railways
“Waddlin’ Willie’s” remarks (B.
9/1/’52) on droving cattle from the N.T.
to Queensland coast hardly tally with
facts. Out of some 80,000 mixed cattle
that crossed the Queensland border from
the N.T. and the Kimberley (W.A.) during
1951-52 few, if any, were ever driven on
the hoof to the Queensland coast. Some
thousands of fats were trucked at Dajarra
(Q.) for treatment at the various meat-
works, and the balance went into the
central and southern districts to be fat-
tened for market, J agree that the costly,
slow and wasteful method of droving
cattle thousands of miles on the hoof is
as antiquated as the wooden plough.
Tick and infectious diseases are dis-
seminated along the stock-route despite
frequent dipping and veterinary inspec-
tions.
It is difficult to see how transport of
beef by air could become a sound
economical long-range proposition. Even
at the prevailing fantastic price of beef,
it seems the Governments have been
approached for a subsidy for the
Kimberley venture. Long-distance trans-
port of live cattle by means of road
trains has proved a failure, excessive
bruising being the most objectionable
feature.
In 1937 the Federal Government
appointed the Payne Commission, a party
of experts who made a thorough and
searching inquiry into all aspects of the
subject. The wisdom of their report has
never been questioned, but no Govern-
ment of any political color has seen fit to
implement it. Two short railways were
strongly recommended in this report, one
from Dajarra, the terminus of the Towns-
ville line, to the Rankine River (N.T.), in
the heart of the Darkly Tableland, a dis-
tance of 250 miles, and estimated at that
period, 1937, to cost about two million
pounds.
The other line proposed by the com-
mission was from Wyndham, in the Cam-
bridge Gulf (W.A.), to Gordon Downs, on
the N.T. border, a distance of 200 miles,
at an estimated cost in 1937 of one-and-
a-half million pounds. The great advan-
tages to be derived from these railways
was very ably demonstrated in the report.
“W.W.” is a super-optimist in his
estimation of the population-supporting
capacity of the north. It took die N.T.
75 years up to 1937 to reach a population
of 5500. Since 1937 (to March, 1950) that
figure has increased to about 14,500,
including a vast army of public servants
and a great number of
Darwin and Alice Springs seem to
support the greater part of the entire
population, although neither of those
towns contributes anything to production.
According to documentary evidence
provided by the Payne commission, pro-
duction possibilities of the N.T. are very
limited, more than half the land being
generally useless according to the
economic standards of the rest of Aus-
tralia, and of negligible value if measured
by the lowest standards of the civilised
world. It is difficult to visualise much
in the way of successful agriculture in
the Territory as rainfall is unsatisfactorily
distributed, areas of good soil are limited
and markets are too far away.
The future of the Territory is largely
bound up with mining and grazing, but
no marked progress can be expected until
the Federal Government gets down to
hard facts. The present policy of road-
building will contribute little to Territory
production.— Bartoni (Q.).
His and Hers
Concession season-tickets for women
are a relic of the days when women’s
wages were only a fraction of the usual
male wage. For example: A yearly
ticket for a man from Granville to
Sydney is approximately £2l, while a
woman can get hers for £l4. I know a
youth of 18, earning about £6 a week,
who has to pay the £2l for his yearly
ticket, while a woman living near him
and earning more than double that
amount gets her ticket for £l4. —W. P. T.
(N.S.W.),
Leigh Creek
Developed as a stopgap when supplies
of N. S. Wales black coal became
irregular and insufficient, S.A.’s Leigh
Creek coalfield has become the keystone
to the State’s power expansion. To meet
the growing demand for industrial and
domestic power, the S.A. Electricity Trust
will increase power-generation from
134.000 kilowatts last year to 325,000 k.w,
by 1958, a programme which could not
have been envisaged while the S.A. Gov-
ernment had to adopt a mendicant
attitude to get its fair share of N. S.
Wales coal.
The additional output will be achieved
by trebling the present capacity of the
Osborne powerhouse and the construction
of a new station at Port Augusta, which
will overcome the expense of carrying
coal by rail to Adelaide. Osborne will
double its present capacity of 60,000 k.w.
within a year by the installation of two
more turbines and four boilers using
Leigh Creek coal, and by 1954 further
boilers capable of burning any sort of
coal will produce another 60,000 k.w.,
bringing the station to its maximum
potential of 180,000 k.w. By 1954 the
Port Augusta station will be producing
60.000 k.w., and two years later it will
reach its full capacity of 90,000 k.w.
Although the extensions at Osborne
will cost about £3 million during the next
four years, and the development of two
power-stations at Port Augusta is
estimated to cost £3O million for the same
period, opencut Leigh Creek coal will
still be a payable proposition and prevent
a repetition of the blackouts and shut-
downs which crippled the State during
the 1949 coal crisis.—W. M. H. (S.A.).
Workers’ Compensation
Many employers, blissfully confident
that their liabilities under the Act are
fully provided for by their workers’-com-
pensation policies, could have a rude
awakening. While the compensation pro-
vided by the Act is limited (as is also
the responsibility accepted by an insur-
ance company under the normal
workers’-compensation policy), it is
open to an employee to suspend
his rights under it, and to claim
damages under Common Law, provided
he can sustain a case that his injuries
resulted from negligence on the part of
the employer, or of some other servant
of the employer.
Under Common Law compensation is
not restricted, and could amount to a
sum sufficient to stagger an employer
financially (with his worker s’-
compensation policy now inapplicable).
Moreover, if an employee fails in his
claim under Common Law, he can still
fall back on his workers’-compensation
rights.
Employers would be well advised to
discuss the matter with their insurance
companies in these days when courts
commonly assess damages in terms ot
thousands of pounds. One can so easily
and innocently be guilty of legal
negligence—a machine guarded, but no
sufficiently so in the eyes of the law, or
a thoughtless act on the part of one or
the claimant’s workmates leading to
injury.— lcinit (N.S.W.).

pumped up from San Francisco Bay,”
permitted subscriptions to local news-
papers, set up a pressing-shop for con-
victs’ clothing, and “tore up a list of stool-
pigeons who had had a soft racket for
years, spying on friends and enemies alike
in exchange for small favors from
officials.” At the time his thirty-days
appointment had been confirmed as a
four-years engagement, three thousand
convicts were signing a petition that he
should get the permanent job.
It is curious that a man who has pre-
sided at so many executions should feel
‘hat “capital punishment is a tragic
failure.” During five years, he says, only
forty-six of two thousand men and
women arrested for murder in California
were executed in San Quentin:
I knew most of these condemned men,
and I have officially executed many others
since then, but all of them said that the
death penalty did not deter them, even
momentarily, from committing their crimes.
It will be seen that he does not shrink
from his responsibility, or from speaking
of it ; evidently it is just part of a job
which he hopes may one day be done
away with; and he devotes a great part
of the book to the last minutes of various
condemned, with their records, and his
efforts to make what is left of life as easy
as possible for them, even to staging
talkies in the condemned block, and sit-
ting in the dark among murderers to
watch films with them —a dangerous pro-
ceeding should those truly desperate men
decide to use him as a hostage or a shield
against the bullets of guards.
For those interested, the “dumpy little
riveted steel cell” —they gas them in San
Quentin —cost 5016 dollars 68 cents, and
ten thousand dollars to install; “operators”
go through twenty-one separate motions,
using funnels, rubber gloves, graduates,
acid pumps, gas-masks, cheesecloth, steel
chains, towels, soap, pliers, scissors, fuses
and a mop; sodium-cyanide eggs,
sulphuric acid, distilled water and
ammonia. The chemists offer a discount
for quantity. A pound of cyanide kills
one man and costs fifty cents —which
must be considered very reasonable—-and,
with the executioner’s fee of fifty dollars
and the cost-accounted man-hours of
warden, guards, doctors and technicians,
and a new suit of clothes for the prisoner,
brings the price of an execution to a
hundred and fifty dollars:
Some rabid supporters of capital punish-
ment have thoughtlessly suggested that this
is a cheap price compared to the nine
hundred dollars a year it costs to maintain
each living prisoner in San Quentin, but
I have long since concluded that the books
will never be balanced on this item.
One would rather leave the prisoner
seated, somewhat ridiculously, on a chair
over a bucket in which cyanide has been
thrown to release its gas, and visit more
cheerful prison scenes: the hobby-shop,
made possible by a piece of legislation
called “Duffy’s Folly,” in 1941, where
they sell convict-made belts, wallets,
picture - frames, jewellery, greeting-
cards, toys and hand-tooled gun-
holsters —among their best customers for
these last are the policemen, deputy
sheriffs and detectives who sent them to
prison. One of the prison grouches is
that visitors steal things off the counters.
Warden Duffy began film showings in
1941 ; later allowed visits from such as
Leo Carillo, Joe E. Brown, William
Powell, Edward G. Robinson, Cesar
Romero, Otto Kruger; a Valentine Day
letter sent to Mae West brought a reply
signed “Sin-sationally yours,” which
seems to have given pleasure, and a secret
—until this book was published—dona-
tion of five hundred dollars to the Inmate
Welfare Fund. For almost ten years the
prison has had an Inmate Departmental
Representative Committee, at which the
men’s problems are debated; a canteen
has wiped out the high prices and
gambling which obtained when tobacco
and such things were illicit; the prison
has its own news-sheet, and a public-
address-system Dorothy Dix session in
which the warden replies to complaints
and questions by the prisoners. For
bread-and-water punishment they have
substituted “Siberian Meat Loaf”:
Two oz. powdered milk, 3Joz. raw grated
potato, loz. tomato puree, chopped
carrots, 3ioz. chopped cabbage, 4oz. ground
beef, 2oz. lard or shortening, soz. red
beans (precooked), loz. white or whole-
wheat flour, loz, table-salt, 1 tablespoon
chopped onion, 1 egg, ioz. chili powder.
During the recent war, the prisoners
showed the same patriotism as that on
which Dr. Wilson commented in
Leavenworth; one of their jobs was
addressing and mailing within 43 days
two-and-a-half billion dollars’ worth of
ration-books to the citizens of California,
with errors announced by accountants as
one-two-thousandth of one per cent. On
the blackmarket the books were worth
three hundred dollars each.
What strikes the reader about this and
a score or so more of Warden Duffy’s
notions is that other men might have had
them and come as awful a bellyflopper as
Warden Holohan with his photo-
engraving plant. For those of us who are
inclined to doubt any man’s ability to
judge accurately what other men will do
in a given situation, Warden Duffy’s
record is rather disquieting.
Reviewed Briefly .
From Longmans come two highly-
informative volumes in a Sculpture in
England series designed to show the
general reader or student the great rich-
ness and variety of English sculpture
which too often is overlooked in admira-
tion of the churches and historical build-
ings in which it is housed. instead of
being regarded as a part of architecture
the works of sculpture are here isolated
to stand in their own right as sculpture.
One volume deals with medieval sculp-
ture the other with “Renaissance to
Early XIX Century”; explanatory and
critical letterpress by H. D. Molesworth,
large and liberal illustrations in black-
and-white, and stiff-paper binding.

Ladies Won’t Wait: Peter Cheyney
(Collins). Whether this is an old title or
a posthumous book, it is at least a
Cheyney the reviewer has not read before.
It is a secret-service book. Michael Kells,
the British agent of a very tough old
master-mind in a country house, has the
manager of his garage in Paris killed by
a motor-car ; then he visits a mysterious
miss at midnight, only to find her liqui-
dated on the bed ; in England he runs
into a Russian menage, and kills the big
brutal Russian, only to find that he is a
former German prison-camp com-
mandant ; then with the aid of a beautiful
White Russian he studies a shrewd woman
couturiere, who disappears into France ;
finally, in Boulogne, with the ravishing
American sister of a kidnapped interna-
tional agent, he traces the brother and
the evil master-mind to a lonely house
with a cellarful of dynamite. Not a
great Cheyney, but a Cheyney.

British Imperial T r usteeship,
1783-1850: G. R. Mellor (Faber). A
reply to critics who see only “exploita-
tion” in Britain’s holding of overseas
possessions and forget, disregard or are
not aware of how much genuine good-
will towards native peoples was mixed up
in the business and the practical humani-
tarian results that were nearly always
aimed at and sometimes achieved. Mr.
Mellor deals with the enslaved Africans
in the West Indies, the Indian coolie
emigrant, the Bantu and the Hottentot,
the American Indian, the Maori and the
Australian aborigine. The book gives a
useful over-all picture and seems careful
in historical scholarship but is too con-
cise to be satisfactory as history and, too
remote and second-hand to be reliable
in its account of present-day conditions
and possibilities for the future. Thus the
uninformed reader would assume from
the New Zealand chapter that the Waikato
War broke out after Grey’s departure,
whereas in fact it occurred after he had
been recalled in a vain effort to prevent
the outbreak ; and the Australian chapter
ends with “a picture of unrelieved
gloom” ; the aborigines being “doomed
inr/itably to extinction” —a borrowed
statement which takes no account of
contrary opinions nor of the efforts (such
as they are) being made to prevent that
doom.
SEA-CHANGE.
1 should, but’ I don’t, surrender my thought
to the sea—
these torn branches, rough logs.
The sea is like an old washerwoman
bending over her tubs. She scrubs
the ribbed board of the shore with arms
white to the elbow in suds.
What a scouring and a rubbing she gives
flotsam delivered to her laundry;
When my thought comes back cleansed
unrecognisable, bumped
bruised, thoroughly scoured of all
fragility and excrescence
1 should thank the sea
for beating my thought to the bone.

The Hastings Deering Cattle Property is a "terminal" on the
railway and is only 90 miles from Alice Springs Railhead in
Central Australia. This property is 2.600 square miles in
area, which is more than a road one mile wide across Australia
Sydney to Perth. St is also equal to a road one mile
wide across America from New York to San Francisco
This Hastings Deering Cattle Property has a twofold significance in near-
future world affairs.
The first is Australia’s responsibility, both in natural desire and national duty,
to provide BEEF FOR BRITAIN.
The second is Australia's national security needs, which demand greater and
still greater beef production, for our increasing population and for the use
of our and our allies' DEFENCE FORCES.
"Bully Beef" is one of our munitions.
