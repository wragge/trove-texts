ANNOUNCEMENT
S. WYNN & CO. PTY. LTD. Winegrowers of
COONAWARRA ESTATE, wish to notify wine-
lovers that their cellar stocks of 1960 Vintage
COONAWARRA ESTATE CLARET are near
depletion.
After the 1960 there is an entire vintage missing.
1961 was a poor year, not of the standard required
for the COONAWARRA ESTATE label, and there-
fore the following vintage will be the 1962.
With the price unchanged, what remains of the 1960,
after more than five years in the grower’s cellarage,
represents exceptional value. Those who appreciate
a good claret would be well advised to invest,
through their suppliers, in some of the rapidly
dwindling stock.

Gestapn
With the linguistic flair which gave
birth to NECOLIM, NEFOS,~and
NASAKOM, the Indonesians have now
dubbed the rebel “30th September Move-
i rnent” the “GESTAPU terror move-
’ ment”. In much the same way as
[NECOLIM was fashioned out of NEo-
COLonial IMperialists, GESTAPU has
been created from GErakan the Indo-
nesian word for movement S standing
f for September and TAPU being an
s Indonesian equivalent for “thirtieth”. A
i spokesman at the Indonesian Embassy in
t Canberra was uncertain whether the
close association with the Nazi terror
police was intended or a coincidence.
Pointing the Bone
HPhe spectacle of outraged taxpayers
A marching on Canberra with
demands for the ABC to stop wasting
public funds on light entertainment
hovered implausibly over Hobart last
week.
Via Press, commercial radio, and even
an ABC television interview, delegates
to the Federation of Australian Com-
mercial Broadcasters’ annual convention
spent considerable time pointing the
bone. Moves by the ABC to enter direct
competition with the 111 commercial
radio stations in Australia “might not
It Gets You In
| r T'HE advertisement promised “a unique
I A passenger list”. Poets, actors, singers
[all performing as the SS Radar speeded
|to its unknown destination. An instru-
jmental group from the University of
ijNSW would play Gluck and Telemann,
jand Bette Simpson would sing someone’s
composition. It seemed too good to miss
the Poetry Society’s first floating re-
cital on Sydney Harbor.
. But arriving aboard promptly, we were
at first disappointed: There was no outer
deck, and everyone sat on seats, in
dresses and lounge suits, rather like a
Commuters’ special from Pymble. Around
the piano up aft the NSW University
choirgirls assembled in white dresses and
jblack gowns to sing, unaccompanied,
(“Advice to the Melancholy” (Anon.).
Douglas Stewart, lugubriously clasping
a copy of “Rutherford and Other
Poems," was sitting on the upper deck,
where the Telemann, originally scored
for treble recorder, oboe and violin with
continuo, sounded faintly from the Uni-
versity of NSW Chamber Music Group
below. “Who, Telephone?" said Stewart,
lapparently prepared for anything up to
Pnd including electronic symphonies. “Oh,
■elemann. Who’s he?” He muttered
Something about whisky and began to
f'oll a cigarette, rather like a man await-
Wg the dentist.
“You should have been downstairs,”
|an English gir' cried. “There was this
{wonderful man with absolutely leonine
'Hair and a marvellous poetic face, waving
bis arms around " A check showed it had
[been Roland Robinson, declaiming about
!“The Water Lubra” and effectively dis-
pelling any suspicions about the 8.10
from Pymble. Mr Robinson, who works
by day as a golf course grccnkeeper, is
every inch a poet, as perfect a Byron or
[Pushkin as we shall ever see in an age
Mien poets conscientiously disguise
themselves as public service clerks, or
the man next door.
We found John Couper, senior lec-
turer from the University of NSW
English Department, a tall, bespectacled
Scottish migrant who writes poems in
Lowland dialect and is a co-editor of
“The Poetry Magazine”. What was the
score? “We had this debt to pay off,”
Couper explained, “so this seemed a good
way of defraying it.” The debt, about
£7OO, had resulted from internal strife,
when a certain woman (said Couper
delicately) had gone overboard publish-
ing extra copies of the magazine in
French. Thousands of them were sitting
around the French Embassy in Canberra,
doomed. It had all been very distressing.
The schism was all over now, said
Couper, although a rival publication,
“Poetry Australia”, was now competing
with “Poetry Magazine”.
Nancy Keesing read her poem about
the Ozone Restaurant at Watson's Bay,
where “a lady with experienced knees”
fed cats on oysters under the table. Doug-
las Stewart descended to read Professor
Piccard. “Precipitous and Icarus,” he
announced between stanzas, “is a hor-
rible rhyme. I’m going to fix it some day.”
Rosemary Dobson couldn’t come, so her
poem, “Captain Svenson,” was read by
Helen Morse, who, with fellow NIDA
graduate Martin Harris, had been hand-
picked by producer Tom Brown to depu-
tise for absent poets.
After the Welsh folk songs we struggled
upstairs to find the NIDA graduates.
The top deck was in darkness. “Who
turned out the lights?" cried an organ-
iser, as we dimly made out the NIDA
couple together in the blackness. Mrs
Turnbull, the Society’s secretary, defen-
ded herself. “The passengers can see the
Harbor much better with the lights out,”
she said.
Bill Hart-Smith, as the lights burned
dangerously low before the ferry started
on the return journey, read poems about
Beatnik Dogs and his bootmaker. “I be-
lieve these dogs are reincarnations of
Australian hoboes,” he confided up aft.
And his bootmaker was in Ben Boyd
Road.
“We should have had Edna St Vin-
cent Millay,” said Nancy Keesing, with
a sweet, vague smile.
A young lady in a dirty raincoat, from
one of the ladies’ magazines, thought it
was rather a dull affair. She, too, had
imagined there'd be some drinks.
“There’s absolutely nothing,” she wailed,
“that I can say.” But one remembered
the placid rock of the ferry, and surely
the King of Norway’s daughter looked
very much like Douglas Stewart’s
daughter, twining her medieval hair be-
side the copper of bubbling tea water.
The distant lights winking, and Dylan
once more the innocent king of the
apple towns . . . Even Mr Hart-Smith’s
bootmaker remained to touch the heart.
Yes, there’s something about poetry that
gets you in.

serve the public interest,” warned out-
going President Mr C. R. Carson, of
4BH Brisbane. In far-off Sydney, the
acting general manager of the ABC, Mr
Clement Semmler, heard the rumblings.
There had been no change in the ABC’s
traditional programme policy, he
declared. The ABC’s second network
continued to provide music, drama, and
talks programmes of a high standard
on a scale no less than before.
And while all this light skirmishing
was going on in the air war, the Federa-
tion’s new director, E. Lloyd Sommer-
lad, delivered a frontal assault on his
own troops. In a long address entitled
“Philosophy for Radio”, he said he
believed radio had a much more serious
mission than building up a “Top 40
image” important as this was in the
general scheme of things. Mr Sommerlad
has come to the FACB with two years
at UNESCO headquarters in Paris under
his belt and a long family tradition with
newspapers behind him. Fie admits that
radio is something new to him. And so
he wanted to speak as something of an
outsider looking in. Fie was tactful: “. . .
we take umbrage if people say the sym-
bol of radio is the disc jockey, or that
radio stations are only interested in
making money. These are unpalatable
and no doubt untrue, but we have all
heard them.” But he was frank: “. . .
there are many people particularly
people in responsible places who
expect a great deal more from radio than
only entertainment.”
Mr Sommerlad thought that radio, to
have prestige and a good public image,
should pay attention to what he called
its "editorial content”. He saw no reason
why radio could not present in an
interesting and entertaining way com-
mentary, discussion and interpretation of
current affairs local, national, and
international.
All of which leaves some questions.
With commercial radio mu tering about
moves by the ABC to muscle in on the
light entertainment field, how long will
it be before the ABC starts to complain
about the commercial radio instrusion
into cultural affairs? And will it make
any difference to the Postmaster-General
who, with a certain amount of jubila-
tion, revealed in Hobart that last year’s
total revenue take from commercial radio
should amount to about £11,500.000?

PLAIN ENGLISH
A Republican Australia
Or, Back to Queen Victoria
Tf there is any issue raised by the an-
* nouncement that Prince Charles
will spend some weeks at school in
Australia next year, it is a political,
not a personal or educational one. Ob-
viously the Prince as a person is wel-
come here and Timbertop, by many
reports, may be a better school than
Gordonstoun. But the Prime Ministers
of both Britain and Australia have dis-
cussed and reached this decision be-
cause they see it as part of a policy
of strengthening loyalty to the mon-
archy in Australia. It is this policy
which has aroused whatever comment
there has been either in Britain (where
one prominent Government MP called
the decision “lunacy”) or in Australia
(where any criticism has been more
muted).
One fairly common attitude about
the monarchy in Australia that can be
rejected immediately is the view that it
is pointless to waste time talking about
such a minor matter when the time
could be better spent talking about
something important and practical such
as defence. This is a lazy evasion of
the issue. The plain truth is that, for
better or worse, the monarchy is a
fascinating fact. There is no end to
the demand, at all levels, for gossip
about royalty and certainly no appa-
rent end to discussions about whether
Australia should continue as a mon-
archy. An institution that commands
such massive interest obviously has an
important influence on our lives, for
better or worse.
Although there is no serious repub-
lican movement in Australia, there is
a sort of unorganised republican under-
ground an increasing number of
people who have no real hope of
seeing their views widely adopted in
the near future but who agree with
each other that Australia would be
better off without the monarchy and
therefore are unsympathetic to the idea
of the Prince of Wales coming to
school here. Their line of argument is
by now clearly enough defined. The
monarchy, they say, is a dangerous-
ly nostalgic institution centring our at-
tentions on a Britain which will, sooner
or later, withdraw from South-East
Asia and tighten its bonds with
Europe, and distracting us from the
grim problems of survival we should
be facing. The monarchy, they say,
is a drag on the spirit of nationalist
independence which Australia urgently
needs to revive. Today Australians
are so lacking in this nationalism that
we let foreigners British or Ameri-
can take over our industries and
natural resources; we remain depend-
ent on foreign institutions such as the
Privy Council or Madison Ave; we
draw our cultural ideas from London
or New York; and we even claim that
we will never be able to defend our-
selves alone.
We seem satisfied to think of our-
selves as colonial natives to be look-
ed after by foreign investors, educated
by foreign cultural leaders, protected
by foreign soldiers. Behind this servile
provincialism is the monarchy. If we
snapped this link, strengthened our
sense of political, economic, strategic
and cultural independence, we could
begin to become a respected nation
with a chance of survival. On such a
view of our problems and their solu-
tion, the visit of the future king is a
step in the wrong direction.
The far more popular monarchist
position is equally clear-cut. It claims
the monarchy introduces continuity,
internationalism and excitement into
what might otherwise be a dull society.
Continuity because Australia has
developed under its monarchy into the
most successful liberal democracy the
world has ever seen or is ever likely
to see, and why should we change it?
Internationalism because it links a
small and unimportant country with
Europe, Asia and Africa through the
Commonwealth and Empire. Excite-
ment because Australia has no tra-
ditions or rituals to compare with
those of the Crown, and why abandon
an institution which is linked by blood
and links us with Charlemagne, Barba-
rossa, and Elizabeth I? As for the
republican claim that the monarchy
stifles Australian independence, the
monarchist dismisses this as mere
theorising: the most nationalist groups,
such as the RSL, are the most mon-
archist. Finally, who wants to add to
the world’s number of pathetic, little
tinpot provincial republics?
The one thing that both republicans
and monarchists appear to agree on is
their dissatisfaction with the present
state of Australia. The one thinks
without expecting too many people to
listen that a republic would re-
vitalise a dependent society; the other
thinks it would take away one of the
main institutions that stops us becom-
ing a complete nonenity of a country.
Given that much agreement and
since republicanism is not a serious
popular movement in Australia the
issue might better be translated into
the question: what should the mon-
archy do both to modernise itself and
sponsor nationalism in Australia?
There can be little doubt that in
Britain the monarchy is still not as-
sociated with the attempts to throw off
the old-fashioned influences that
hinder Britain adjusting to a com-
petitive world and revitalising its in-
stitutions. It is still associated with
aristocracy, pomp and nostalgia,
rather than with meritocracy, com-
petitiveness and efficiency. If this is
true in Britain, it is equally so in Aus-
tralia to the extent that it holds up the
least admirable sides of British life
for our admiration.
The point, however, is that the trouble
lies with the contemporary monarchy,
not the monarchy as an institution. The
British monarchy in the 19th century
was on the side of innovation and ex-
pansion; Queen Victoria and Prince
Albert sponsored the modernisation of
British industry and Government and
the development of the Empire. To-
day Prince Philip makes progressive
noises but they are not taken serious-
ly, and, with the Empire gone, the
monarchy is too often less a sponsor
of progress than a fantasy substitute
for lost glories. This is where its con-
temporary failure lies, and brief visits
from the Prince of Wales are no sub-
stitute for reappraisal.
Curiously, the period in which the
monarchy was most progressive was
also the period in which it was most
savagely lampooned in the Press, as,
for example, in the illustrations on
page 11 from The Bulletin of the
1880 s and 1890 s. The monarchy
was then a vigorous force and not an
escapist fantasy world that had to
be protected from rough-and-tumble
criticism. Perhaps the best thing that
monarchists could do is revive the
rugged, irreverent approach to mon-
archy that marked Queen Victoria’s
reign.


THIS AUSTRALIA
DEFENCE
Sophistication and Strategy
“Radical measures ”
AUSTRALIA'S MIRAGES
By a SPECIAL
CORRESPONDENT
The Defence Report tabled last week is the most sophisticated public document
to come out of the Defence Department, excepting perhaps Senator Paltridge’s article
in the latest issue of “Foreign Affairs”. In last year’s report, the context of our defence
policy and provisions was very sketchily done. A real attempt has now been made
to explain even though in broad terms the practical and strategic basis of our
commitments, and the uneasy prospects ahead.
In retrospect, the past year has seen
some remarkable developments in Aus-
tralia’s defence preparedness and posture,
which we should not forget when tempted
to castigate the Government for its earlier
apathy. Three years ago, who would have
believed it possible to bring in a two-
year compulsory service scheme, for
overseas operations if required? Yet
selective National Service has got under
way, with a minimum of difficulties. The
intake has been expanded to the extent
that it should give the Army, by the end
of 1966, a full-time strength of 40,000
its greatest since World War 11. The
exotic but unproven pentropic organisa-
tion has been discarded. Legislation has
provided for the citizen forces to be
called out in a time of defence emergency
and sent overseas if required. Mirages,
as good all-weather fighters as any in the
world, are coming into service with the
RAAF. The controversial FIIIA has
flown. The Navy has obtained its first
guided-missile destroyer and a new sub-
marine has been launched.
In terms of commitments, we have
increased our naval strength in Malaysian
waters, provided a battalion of infantry
on rotation to help Malaysian and British
forces defend northern Borneo, and a
further battalion group to assist in the
defence of South Vietnam against Com-
munist aggression and subversion.
These are radical measures. They indi-
cate a marked change both in Govern-
ment thinking and public opinion. In
May, 1963, the Prime Minister forecast
a defence expenditure for 1965-66 of
£270 million. The current report places
it at £385 million, without allowing for
increases in pay, the higher National
Service call-up, or the additions to our
Vietnam component. These will bring
the total to around £4OO million. This
is almost exactly double the 1961-62
expenditure of £203 million. The large-
ness of the current figure is, of course,
partly due to the smallness of the earlier
one, and much of the increase is taken
up with capital expenditure on ships,
aircraft, buildings, equipment, etc, for
which quick provision had to be made.
In addition to (or perhaps because of)
the information it provides on all three
Services and the activities of the Depart-
ment of Supply, the Defence Report
raises doubts and invites queries.
For the Navy, the big question is
whether any provision is going to be
made to replace the Sea Venoms (the
fighter planes carried by the aircraft-
carrier Melbourne ) when these are re-
tired in 1967, and thus retain an air-
strike capacity. Additionally, or alter-
natively, is the Government irrevocably
opposed to a new carrier? The figures,
and the reported state of some of the
naval training establishments, make one
wonder also whether the Navy has been
spending too small a portion of its
financial allocation on essential works.
The Army’s report gives in outline
the basic organisation of the “new”
division, which it claims to be light and
air-portable. This is, in principle, sound;
but it is not clear whether the numbers
of aircraft and helicopters, armored
vehicles and landing craft are available
or even on order to give the division (of
which six battalions have now been
raised) the mobility for which it is de-
signed. Some new equipment is men-
tioned (for the first time, so far as this
correspondent is aware), such as the
“Redeye” portable anti-aircraft missile
system, the American M 79 40 mm
grenade-launcher, and the Australian
“Dart” radio-control target system. It is
interesting to note the Army’s introduc-
tion of an adult-training scheme for
tradesmen, of the kind so unintelligently
rejected by the trade unions. This would
seem to be a scheme the other Services
could usefully copy.
By the end of August, 19 Mirage


fighters (fewer than originally planned)
had been delivered to the RAAF, and
the Matra air-to-air missile is in service.
There is no question as to the effective-
ness of the Mirage in its interceptor
capacity, provided the ground radar
facilities are installed. But there is a
doubt whether it is, as claimed, a “highly
effective aircraft ... for the support of
the army in the land battle”. In theory,
it should be splendid. In fact it may be
too fast, its endurance too limited. In
this role the Sabres can probably do a
better job than the Mirages, and may
need a different replacement when they
become too old. An anti-shipping missile
is another possible need.
Overall, there is a new spirit in our
defence, at all levels. It is long overdue,
but all the more welcome. It was a pity
that the Minister for Defence was not
present when his report was tabled, and
he will presumably not attend the esti-
mates debate. His illness has brought too
slow a reaction from the Government.
The Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies,
and Sir Edwin Hicks, have in effect been
joint Defence Ministers a far from
satisfactory situation. It may have been
better to appoint Mr Hasluck (who was
for a time Minister of Defence) to look
after Senator Paltridge’s work while he
was away.
Defence and foreign affairs have
rarely been so little separated in peace-
time as they are today. Over the past
few months Mr Hasluck has been giving
careful explanations of foreign and de-
fence policy, of a kind the Australian
people have long needed but not often
received. His speech to Parliament last
week on the situations in Indonesia, Viet-
nam and the Indian sub-continent was
modestly phrased but as informative as
it could be. It should give no offence.
Indeed, his reference to “genuinely dis-
interested international assistance” to
Indonesia if it can concentrate upon
domestic construction and development,
is presumably part of the Government's
policy quietly conveyed to those in
authority in Djakarta. We should do
everything we can to assist those forces
which are determined to resist Com-
munist influence; to help in alleviating
the present food shortage in Indonesia;
and to divert attention and effort from
the economically and politically wasteful
policy of confrontation.
The Minister spoke of Parliament’s
sympathy for the relatives of those who
have been lost in the Vietnam war. This
sympathy is shared by all Australians.
But we must not get the problem out of
perspective. So far in New South Wales
this year the equivalent of more than a
whole battalion has been lost (killed)
men, women and children on the
roads in New South Wales.
PARLIAMENT
The Giggling Liberals
“ Physician , cure thyself”
By ALAN REID
Parliamentary back-benchers, particularly Government back-benchers, spent at
long time recently complaining that the Ministry, bureaucracy, Press and other bodies
were not giving Parliamentary back-benchers the respect or responsibility to which
they were entitled.
After last week’s events, which cul-
minated in the ejection of Jim Cope
(Lab. NSW) from the House of Repre-
sentatives for calling John Jess (Lib.
Vic.) an “arrogant cur”, Government
back-benchers would do well to study the
Biblical exhortation, “Physician, cure
thyself”, before complaining about the
shortcomings of others. While it was
Cope who got the Parliamentary chop-
per, in fairness to him he was only a
final contributor to the trouble, not its
initiator.
The blame goes back to a group of
Government back-benchers who giggled
like flirtatious schoolgirls when Labor’s
Len Reynolds (NSW) was trying to deal
seriously with the question of amenities
for Australian soldiers fighting, and in
some cases dying and suffering casual-
ties, in Vietnam. Reynolds, small and
serious, has about him much of the
earnestness of the schoolteacher he once
was. But the subject with which he was
dealing was a serious one which entitled
him to a quiet hearing and not' the
girlish giggling of Government back-
benchers. As Reynolds complained bit-
terly and justifiably: “Having regard for
what these young men are doing, and
bearing in mind how little is demanded
from the rest of us in connection with
Australia’s commitments in Vietnam, I
think we ought to do a little better for
them than we apparently are doing.”
Reynolds and those members of the
Labor Party, who were in the chamber
of the House of Representatives, were
obviously irritated deeply by the Govern-
ment back-benchers’ flippant and cavalier
attitude. In the first part of his speech
Army Minister Jim Forbes, who should
have known better, did nothing to dis-
courage this attitude on the part of his
back-benchers. In fact he fed it by gibing
at Reynolds for taking an interest in
Australian servicemen “when they are
in South Vietnam where there is an
ideological motivation for their (Labor)
interest”.
Only when he was half-way through
his speech did Forbes appear to wake up
to how politically stupidly he was be-
having. From then on he tried to answer
the specific complaints on lack of mail
and amenities, delays in receiving pay
and the like that Reynolds had com-
plained about. At this stage he seemed
to realise that, as the responsible Minis-
ter, he had an obligation to encourage
Opposition interest in the welfare of
Australian servicemen overseas, not to
ridicule it.
But the damage was already done.
Forbes’ speech undoubtedly encouraged
Liberal back-bencher Jess (who had the
merit of not being one of the group of
gigglers, but a Government member who
at least dealt, however mistakenly,
seriously with a serious subject) to
launch an attack on Reynolds, charging
that he was trying to undermine Aus-
tralian morale in Vietnam.
Personally, I thought that Jess over-
stated grossly this viewpoint, as well as
failing to realise that the morale of
Australians is more likely to be under-
mined by knowledge that there is no
public outlet for their grievances. Jess
accused Reynolds of trying to raise
doubts in the minds of parents with
sons serving in Vietnam. In my view,

TOP PRIZE
WINNER FOR
TWELVE YEARS
Since its introduction in 1953, Orlando
Barossa Riesling has won more awards
than any other Australian Riesling.
One hundred and thirty-two major
awards, in fact, including Gold and
Silver Medals, Championships and Cups
throughout Australia and in Europe.
Last year, its greatest honour was the
Gold Medal awarded at the International
Viticultural and Wine Fair at Mont-
pellier, France, world-famous centre
for wine study and research.
Every bottle of Barossa Riesling awarded
a prize has been taken at random from
stock proof positive of the wine’s
unfailing consistency.
Two major reasons why you can rely
on Barossa Riesling are:
* It is bottled in the traditional European
amber Riesling bottle, in preference to
a green bottle, because Riesling needs
bottle age, and amber glass keeps
out the light while the wine is aging.
* It is one of the very few Australian
Rieslings vintaged 100% from Rhine
Riesling grapes.

the doubts in the minds of parents will
arise if they have no Parliamentary out-
let for their grievances, real or imagined,
and Ministerial assurances that the griev-
ances, if real, will be removed and, if
imagined, explained away.
The incident got Frank Stewart, a
youngish Sydney Labor member, who
normally is a quiet but effective speaker
and courteous in his Parliamentary
habits, into trouble. There was an inter-
jection from the group of Government
gigglers which Hansard did not catch,
and hence went unrecorded in the
official records. Stewart apparently
thought the interjection came from
Queensland Liberal Dr Gibbs, and
turned on him to blast him. Gibbs denied
making the interjection. Tasmanian
Liberal Adrian Gibson put up his hand.
“I was the one who interjected.”
Stewart, who was trying to support
the right of Reynolds to put “moder-
ately” (and Reynolds had undoubtedly
been moderate in the manner in which
he spoke) a case on the grievances of
Australian servicemen in Vietnam, lost
his usual imperturbability and did some-
thing that happily is rare in the Federal
Parliament He extended his war against
Gibson to Gibson’s private life. Gibson
recently announced his engagement, and
the girl to whom he is engaged is
wealthy. Said Stewart with untypical
viciousness: “Mr. Gibson is now in a
position where he can afford to sit back
and make a laughing stock out of the
Parliament. He does not even need to
go to work because he is going to marry
a millionairess. There is no need for
him to be serious in this place because
he can afford to live on his wife-to-be.”
Assistant Government Whip Bert Kelly
justifiably then moved that the question
be put, and Stewart was gagged.
As might be expected Stewart apolo-
gised in the Parliament the next day
for his behavior, but toughly returned
to his criticism of Forbes and Jess. From
there it was on for old and young and
Cope finished up as the final victim,
being ejected from the Parliament after
refusing a request from his Leader, Mr
Calwell, to withdraw his assertion that
Jess was “an arrogant cur”.
Neither side showed up well in the
incident. The reputation of Parliament,
which earlier in the Estimates debate
back-benchers declared was being dam-
aged by forces outside the Parliament,
was not enhanced. Both sides and
particularly the group of Government)
back-benchers who giggled while a !
serious subject involving the welfare of
Australians who are placing their lives
on the line for their country in Vietnam
was under discussion might well take
a look at who really docs the most
damage to the prestige and public image
of the Parliament.


EDUCATION
Fifth-Class Power
Victoria’s break-away teachers
The Victorian Government’s “final offer” to settle the teachers’ dispute was a
joke. At present the Teachers’ Tribunal consists of three men: an independent but
Government-appointed chairman, a Government representative, and a teachers’ rep-
resentative, the latter a primary teacher.
The secondary teachers have been
agitating to have a secondary teacher
replace the primary teachers’ represen-
tative when secondary claims over salaries
and conditions are being heard. The
technical teachers and professional
officers division of the Education Depart-
ment, encouraged by the campaign of
the Victorian Secondary Teachers’ As-
sociation, are now making similar claims.
The Minister for Education, Mr
Bloomfield—himself a former teacher—
offered to add to the present Teachers’
Tribunal a part-time Government rep-
resentative, and, according to whether
secondary, technical, or professional
officers’ claims were being heard, a part-
time representative from the appropriate
branch. The present three-man tribunal
would still hear primary claims.
In effect the offer means that when
the claims of primary teachers were
being heard, the primary division would
have a one-third voting power (as at
present) and the other branches of the
teaching service none. But when, for
example, secondary teachers’ claims came
up, the primary teachers’ representative
would still have a vote, of one-fifth
power, and the secondary teachers’ rep-
resentative and an extra Government
representative would each have a similar
one-fifth voting power.
It was scarcely surprising that the
VSTA did not find this offer satisfactory.
They do not feel that the secondary
teachers’ growing demand for adequate
conditions and professional status will be
far advanced by the decisions of a
tribunal on which it could be out-voted
4 to 1, or, even if the primary teachers’
representative sided with the secondary,
they could still be out-voted three to two.
Whilst the claims and offers are still
proceeding the Victorian Teachers’
Union, which is dominated by primary
teachers, is in danger of breaking up.
There is a significant exodus of second-
ary teachers away from the VTU to the
VSTA, and break-away movements have
begun in the technical and professional
divisions.
The VTU. whilst some of its leaders
have been militant in political affairs
outside of their teaching role, is paying
the price for conservatism and lack of
imagination in its concern for the wel-
fare of all parts of the teaching pro-
fession. Characteristically, the Left-
wing element in its leadership has failed
to see that there is more than a demand
for increased salaries at the heart of the
present dispute. The real militants in
terms of effective organisation and
realistic demand for improvements in
the education system are now the leaders
of the VSTA.
The bloc opposing the secondary
teachers’ campaign is composed of the
liberal ministry, conservative primary
teachers conditioned to obey the depart-
ment at all times, and Leftist idealogues
suspicious of any claims which are not
simply economic. It is an alliance that
lacks unity or initiative.

TRANSPORT
Rail-roading
Dr Ross’s election
The current NSW railway dispute is linked closely with the personality, back-
ground and history of Lloyd Maxwell Ross, D.Litt., MA, LL.B, secretary of the NSW
branch of the Australian Railway Workers’ Union.
The role of Dr Ross in the present
dispute has puzzled many, annoyed
some and ieft others completely con-
fused. As in most trade-union battles
the clash of personalities has greatly in-
fluenced the course of the dispute.
It is necessary to recall some memories
of the current issue which has already
brought Sydney and Newcastle public
transport to a standstill in two 24-hour
stoppages. Although it is not generally
known, the campaign for the service
increment wage rise for railway em-
ployees came not from the ARU, but
from the Right-wing Australian Society
of Engineers. Last October, delegates to
the NSW Labor Council were mildly
surprised when this union set the pattern
for the present campaign by seeking to
have the system agreed to by the Bolte
Government in Victoria applied to the
railway services in NSW. This took the
initiative immediately out of the hands
of the ARU and Dr L. Ross. It has
remained so and there is only a slight
chance that the ARU might regain
control.
This Right-wing initiative was taken
deliberately to forestall a repetition of the
1959-60 railway dispute which harassed
the then Labor Government. In that
dispute Dr L. Ross had complete charge
and never let go. His Right-wing critics
have never forgotten this.
In this dispute Dr Ross has had little
or nothing to say at the many meetings

of the unions organising the campaign.
At one meeting his only contribution was
to move the adjournment. Realising that
he had lost the initiative, Dr Ross
apparently also calculated that whatever
he did would be countered by the Right.
His early suggestions that the length of
any stoppages should be limited to either
two or four hours were never considered.
One reason for this was that the union
covering engine drivers—the Australian
Federated Union of Locomotive Engine-
men —had refused to take part in any
stoppage of less than 24 hours.
The Right-wing tactic in moving for
24-hour stoppages was twofold: it pre-
vented Dr Ross from gaining prestige in
the dispute; and at the same time pre-
vented any march through the city
streets with Labor Council officers in
the forefront—which was what the Com-
munist Party had tried hard to organise.
The Communists wanted to emulate
recent city marches in Melbourne where
the Trades Hal! Council leader Mick
Jordan, a Right-winger, has been forced
to lead Left-wing militants in parades
which he opposed.
Dr Ross was at home ill when his
Federal president, and top Victorian
Communist, Mr J. J. Brown, made his
unexpected mission to Sydney to have
the strike called off. Mr Brown was
concerned that wage rises of up to 295.
a week about to be ratified for Tas-
manian railway workers would be with-
drawn if the stoppage went on.
The Right wing was not happy about
calling off the strike but agreed to do
so on one condition: the ARU had to
move the resolution cancelling the strike.
It has been a bad period for Dr Ross.
Dr Ross now faces a ballot for re-elec-
tion for the next three years as State
ARU secretary, but at the present time
it seems that Dr Ross faces a formidable
task in retaining his grip on the State
branch.
IMMIGRATION
Father and Son
“Immoral and illegal ”
Australia’s administration of its im-
migration laws took a hammering in the
Italian Parliament last week when mem-
bers of three parties protested against
denial of an Australian visa to Pasquale
Santanastaso, whose nine-year-old son is
living in Sydney.
The Socialist Lezzi claimed that a
study of the questions by international
law experts had shown that Australia’s
stand could not be justified. When
Santanastaso was divorced from his Aus-
tralian wife in Sydney the court granted
him access to his child, Alfredo, for
four hours each Sunday, but he cannot

exercise this right because Canberra will
not grant him a visa.
Lezzi quoted the August 15, 1964,
Bulletin article on the Santanastaso
case and said Santanastaso had been
heard because he is an ex-governmental
commissar for emigration who is son
of a Supreme Court magistrate and
relative of a former senator. Speaking
in the name of other Socialist deputies,
Lezzi suggested that there are other cases
of unjust treatment of Italian migrants
in Australia which are not made public
because those concerned lack education
and connections.
One of the three under-secretaries of
the other major party in the govern-
mental coalition, Oscar Scalfaro of the
Christian Democrats, made an im-
passioned speech in which he claimed
that the Australian Government could
not justify its arbitrary denial of a
father’s right to contact his son.
A Liberal Party parliamentarian,
Cariota Ferrara, denounced the action
of the Australian authorities as immoral
and illegal, and an unjustified abuse.
“Santanastaso’s son is an Italian citizen
who was taken from Italy by a series
of acts punishable under our penal
code,” continued Cariota Ferrara, '‘and
now he is denied his father’s affection
in contradiction to a judgment made
by an Australian court.”
The unknown continent had copious
publicity out of the case: the Milanese
daily “II Giorno” made this “incredible
story” its mam front-page feature, it
was given prominence in the other major
papers, and agency coverage ensured
that a full report was available to over
100 dailies throughout Italy. The only
Australia-linked story which has had
comparable impact was the Prasad case
which was reported dramatically on tele-
vision.
There is probably more similar pub-
licity on the way. There seems to be a
presumption that if a visa is steadfastly
refused the case will die. Everything,
however, points the other way. Scalfaro,
who ranks after the number one man,
party secretary Rumor, in the Christian
Democrat hierarchy, spoke with deter-
mination; other Socialist and Social
Democrat deputies intend to pursue the
subject, while Italian dailies and weekly
magazines have never before talked so
much about Australia.
DESMOND O'RADY
ECONOMY
Pocket Pinching
Overtime loss
The big consumer squeeze looked to be on in earnest going on last week’s
evidence from industry and trade. Business people, whom the squeeze is beginning
to hit as hard as the public, were asking whether it demands a reversal of the
Government’s repressive fiscal and monetary policies.
These are designed not only to keep
inflationary pressure contained but also
to make more room in the economy for
defence and to make economic activity
conform to the pattern of the balance of
payments.
Although the danger that the economy
could slide into recession unless
economic policy is kept flexible must be
recognised, the answer to the business
people’s question at the moment is prob-
ably in the negative. This is not so much
because inflationary pressures are an
ever-present danger in an economy at
full stretch, and, in a mild form, are
present in this one; nor, judging by the
heartening halt to the drain on overseas
reserves in the first half of October when
the fruits of the lush exporting season
rolled in to offset what may still be a
very fast imports flow, is there any
immediate threat of a balance-of-pay-
ments crisis. The best reason is that at
long last the economy is in the process
of getting some relief from demand
pressures and will be all the healthier
after a pause.
Yet there is no denying the economic
pace is slowing. The Commonwealth
Statistician has put it on the line that
the growth in retail sales nation-wide
stopped almost to a crawl in August.
Industrial production in September had
its worst setback for years when 22 out
of 35 main industries had outputs lower
than in the same month last year.
Although Mr McMahon’s latest employ-
ment survey for mid-September speaks
of a further tightening in the labor
market, the position has eased a lot in
the last six weeks.
If the rise of 1.1 per cent in consumer
prices also reported last week reflected
an increase in inflationary pressure, this
in itself would be sufficient to make the
authorities most wary about changing
course. However, while the persistent
rise of about 4 per cent in consumer
prices averaged over the last two years
suggests a mild ground-swell of inflation-
ary pressure, the increase at the rate of
4.4 per cent a year in the September
quarter seems not to have been caused
by any overall excess spending power,
but mostly by a shortage of meat.
The poor performance of retail sales
in August, coupled with reports of con-
tinued slackening since, points strongly
to the conclusion that excess demand
is no longer the main problem.
Although the full employment of ait
expanding work force whose pay packets
have been increased by the li per
cent rise in margins might suggest that
spending power is rising at a sufficient
rate to keep industrial output at full
pitch, it must be remembered that the
Budget’s taxation increases have made a
big bite not only in take-home pay but
also in purchasing power terms for beer,
tobacco and petrol. Again, quite apart
from the lay-offs in the automotive
industry, there has been a general reduc-
tion in overtime in many other indus-
tries. This, probably more than anything
else, is responsible for taking the edge
off.
The Government is probably not at all
unhappy that its policies are at long last
having the desired effect of dampening
activity, even if it cannot be wholly
satisfied about the continued upward
trend of prices. It will be anxious,
though, to ensure all these processes
don’t go too far. It doubtless thinks it
will be time enough to stop the process
next year when, the Treasurer thinks, the
balance of payments will be in better
shape. A mild recession would certainly
help to achieve this be reducing the im-
ports bill. However, many people argue
that a better way to do it would be to
impose import restrictions without the
recession.

SCIENCE
Sweet Success
Re-cleaning water
A team of Australian physical
chemists, led by Dr D. E. Weiss, of
Melbourne, believe they are on the edge
of a development which will allow the
establishment of commercial plants to
produce “sweet” water at a substantially
reduced cost.
Dr Weiss and his colleagues believe
that a new “Sirotherm” process will
make it less costly to remove small
amounts of salt and other impurities
from partially saline water than to
purify sea water. He supplied technical
details of the process to 1500 delegates
from 65 nations attending the Inter-
national Water Desalination Symposium
in Washington, DC, earlier this month.
The process is based on the discovery
by Dr Weiss and his colleagues of a
method of re-cleaning water, demineral-
ising resins by heat instead of by ex-
pensive chemical treatment. Methods
based on ion-exchange and electro-
dialysis could be cheaper than distilla-
tion which is currently being linked with
nuclear power in ambitious schemes to
obtain fresh water from the sea on a
mammoth scale.
Dr Weiss told the Washington sym-
posium that too little attention is being
paid to developing methods for the
treatment of water containing relatively
small quantities of impurities. He claims
that this approach is more likely to
produce fresh water at a cost as low as
the Is. per 1000 gallons required to
compete with natural sources of sweet
water than is the distillation of sea
water.
This is where the Sirotherm process
is likely to find a place. In some parts
of Australia the local water supplies
contain up to 500 parts per million of
dissolved salts and are therefore unsuit-
able for many industrial uses. Even in
areas where salinity is not serious, the
salt content is likely to rise in future
as the re-use of water becomes necessary.
Eventually, says Dr Weiss, some form
of inexpensive treatment will be needed
to de-salt municipal waters for both
domestic and industrial use.
lon-exchange demineralisation is one
of the cheaper methods adapted to puri-
fication of less concentrated saline water.
The salts are removed by passing the
water over specially treated resins, which
take up the salt ions.
The process only became feasible
when resins were found that stood up
to repeated regeneration. Special equip-
ment was built to automatically subject
ion-exchange resins to thousands of suc-
cessive cycles of heating and cooling.


Professor under Siege
The Goldberg variations
By VINCENT BUCKLEY
When, early in 1963, Samuel Louis Goldberg came to the Challis Chair of English
Literature in the University of Sydney, a murmur of relief and expectation ran
through that University. For something over a decade, the department had been
famous for the amount of bad blood it seemed able to pump up; personal enmities
were commonplace, and grievances almost a way of life. In 1962 it had been in the
unusual position of having to appoint three new professors together.
Goldberg was the second of these
appointed; and since he would be work-
ing with Professor George Russell, him-
self a man of outstanding calibre, it
seemed reasonable to expect that he
would bring both a new' life and a long
overdue stability to the unhappy place.
Less than three years later those
expectations have been dramatically
broken; and Goldberg is faced with the
prospect of a split department, in only
part of which his writ will run. This has
happened apparently on the initiative
of the third professor, G. A. Wilkes, the
Professor of Australian Literature, who
has suddenly asked, and gained, per-
mission from the Vice-Chancellor to
organise courses alternative to Gold-
berg’s in English Literature which
had generally been supposed to be
peculiarly Goldberg’s province, and to
take over a substantial proportion of
Goldberg’s staff to enable him to do so.
There is no doubt that Goldberg
brought a new liveliness to his depart-
ment; but all chance of a new stability
now seems denied for the foreseeable
future. What will happen is of course
obscure, since the Faculty of Arts has
yet to discuss whether alternative courses
in English Literature are academically
desirable in any case. In the meantime,
sides have been taken, students have
expressed grave concern at what has
happened in the department and what is
likely to happen to them under any new
dispensation; and Wilkes’ move, the
reasons for it, and its implications have
been subject to speculation in universi-
ties and in newspapers, both here and
in England.
Goldberg is a Melbourne man and
a university man through and through.
Born in 1926, he had a brilliant
academic history, first at University High
School, later in the combined honors
schools of English and History at the
University of Melbourne. He was
prominent in student affairs as a
champion debater and one of the leading
personalities of the non-totalitarian Left.
After tutoring for two years in the
Department of English, he went to
Oxford. There he did his B.Litt. under
the famous scholar David Nichol Smith;
his subject was English prose of the
16th and 17th centuries, and his
emphasis was on social and intellectual
movements. In 1952 he was asked to
devise and teach a special course in
literature for members of Ruskin Col-
lege, that unique Oxford institution
which is supported largely by trade-
union sources; and he still remembers
those students with affection.
Returning to Melbourne, he worked
as lecturer and, later, as senior lecturer
in his old department. He taught a
range of subjects, and quickly gained the
reputation of being a dynamic and com-
pelling teacher. Nor was his influence
confined to his own students. To
broaden the field of English Literature,
he kept up liaison with people in the
Departments of Philosophy, History and
Modern Languages. He was also largely
responsible for the immense and rapid
growth in the University’s Literature
Club which, under his inspiration, be-
came one of the most lively and im-
portant institutions in the University. Id
its new form it gave birth to “Compass”,
a journal of undergraduate writing and,
in 1958, to the “Melbourne Critical
Review”, a journal of literary criticism.
Both of these still exist, the second, still
under Goldberg’s editorship, now having
an international reputation.
He was an obvious choice for the
Challis Chair; yet he must have found
many things in his new University to
challenge and even alarm him. Mel-
bourne’s tradition is communal, Sydney’s
individualist; where Melbourne prizes
gentility, Sydney tends towards asser-
tiveness. He came into a department
with twice as many staff members, and
almost twice as many students, as the
one he had left. In Melbourne he had
worked under a single professor; in
Sydney he was himself one of three. In
the first two years of his incumbency,
the number of people on the Literature
staff almost doubled, as did the number
of students doing honors.
Faced with an enormous amount of
hard work, much of it pioneering, he
imported several staff members from
Melbourne, a fact which has since been
held against him, and which has even
been taken by one commentator as a
proof that he is a “Leavisite”. Yet he
found time to play a strong role in draw-
ing up the new “Wyndham Scheme”
proposals for the NSW Leaving Cer-
tificate.
Charming, friendly, patient, energetic,
with a sense of humor much more varied
and flexible than most of his colleagues
enjoy, he is also occasionally imperious;
and if he reveals at times a streak of
the hard-headed negotiator, he is also a
man who will, in the end, back his own
judgment even if it leaves some corns
smarting. For example, he is known to

Precisely why Wilkes took a course
of action which would encroach on
Goldberg’s field I do not know, since
Wilkes has offered no explanation. In
public controversy it has been claimed
that Goldberg was unfair and dictatorial
in his dealings with his staff.
By far the most persistent claim, how-
ever, is one which involves the word
“ideology”. It is this word and. its im-
plications which most concern me here,
and on them it is fitting for anyone
f° comment.
More than once it has been claimed
that he is an “ideological critic”, that
he wants to organise or manipulate his
department so as to reflect and advance
that ideology, and that that ideology is
“Leavisism”. That is the view of him
which was put, with a slightly doctrin-
aire bluntness, by a writer in the new
but now defunct journal, City Voices .
“Professor Goldberg is an ideo-
logical critic, and a fortiori, an
ideological teacher of the type desig-
nated ‘Leavisite’ . . . The tone of his
writings, the authors he chose to
lecture on and the judgments of their
works he offered to an English 111
evening class of 1963 of which I was
a member, his choice of phrase, in
both books and lectures, betray his
Leavisite bent. That is so, isn't it?”
Passing over the reflection that a
“bent” is not the easiest thing in the
world to estimate accurately, one sees
that certain assumptions are being too
easily made. One assumption is that a
body of beliefs and attitudes can be dis-
tinguished quite clearly as Leavisite, and
can be seen to be held with such ex-
clusive and prescriptive rigor as to con-
stitute an ideology, or something like
one; to that I personally would say that,
while some people who have been
strongly influenced by Dr F. R. Leavis,
the famous Cambridge critic, display
critical interests tending towards such
rigor, many others do not. The second
assumption is that Goldberg is an
example of the first of these kinds; and
that seems to me simply untrue.
Of course, by the time you reach the
end of the article to which I have been
referring, you realise that certain dos-
siers have been opened to produce it,
and that the central contention has been
not so much supported by arguments as
surrounded by them. It is, in fact, open
to debate in what sense Goldberg is a
“Leavisite” at all.
That fiercely sardonic anti-Leavis man,
Professor James McAuley, gave a re-
markably favorable review of Goldberg’s
“Current Affairs Bulletn” on Leavis
in The Bulletin and ended by suggest-
ing that he was in a surprising degree of
agreement with Goldberg's estimate of
his subject. And 1 think it fair to guess
that the pure, or shall I say the over-
proof, Leavisites would not be likely
to think Goldberg (or myself, for that
matter) a man of their own spirit.
Actually, the issue becomes quite
clear when we look at Goldberg’s pub-
lished work. The CAB in question
stresses that Leavis is “great, not per-
fect or final; a critic, not an oracle”. His
largest works to date, the two books
on James Joyce, are concerned to give
very high place to a writer “for whom”,
as has been justly remarked, “Dr Leavis
has declared a profound distaste”. I am
reasonably familiar with the field of
Joyce criticism, since I wrote my M.A.
thesis on him, and have since lectured
on him; and I would have no hesitation
in saying that, as to their quality, Gold-
berg’s two books are the best I know,
and that, as to their kind and temper,
they are humanist in a way very dif-
ferent from that characteristic of Leavis.
Goldberg’s “enjoyment” of “Ulysses”


is, as he mentions, “keen and deep”; and
enjoyment is something of which, so
the legend runs, “Leavisites” are in-
capable. He praises American critics for
the “warm and easy recognition” which
they, as distinct from their English
counterparts, have given the book; and
he suggests that, in dealing with a work
of this sort, produced by a sensibility
of Joyce’s sort, it is an inestimable
advantage for a critic to be able to look
to “wider traditions than the English
to Continental literatures, to Catholicism,
even to Eastern and primitive cultures”.
Yet we have been given to suppose, for
the past 30 years, that “Leavisites”,
having the bleak consistency of a Puri-
tan sect, distrust warmth and ease and
will look favorably on nothing which
cannot be comfortably pigeon-holed in
a provincial “great tradition”.
Goldberg’s longest work, “The Classi-
cal Temper” is a book of great intel-
lectual distinction, but it also has the
warmth and ease which he praises in
the Americans, It is a humanist work,
not merely in the sense that it recom-
mends, but also in the sense that it
exemplifies a humane interest in life and
literature. It is probably the best book
of literary criticism produced by an
Australian. I can hardly imagine any-
one who knows very much about Joyce
or Joyce criticism (or about Leavis, if
it comes to that) thinking it a doctrinaire
work. It is, on the contrary, a sustained
investigation of its subject, an explora-
tion guided throughout by an evident
sympathy.
No doubt the critical language used
may often remind the uneasy reader too
much of Leavis: “maturity, detachment,
impersonality of judgment”, “a firm
grasp on the centrally human”. But if
everyone who uses such terms is by
definition a disciple of Leavis, then
almost every English department in this
country (to say nothing of England) is
irremediably infected. We cannot settle
large matters of critical allegiances by
mentioning certain habits of diction. It
is the critical procedure which is crucial;
and if Goldberg’s central judgments in
this book are remote from Leavis’, so is
his procedure, his expository method,
which shows, in fact, a sense of order
often associated with the scholar rather
than the critic.
Perhaps, though, he is doctrinaire in
his teaching and in his setting of sylla-
buses. During the years in which we
were colleagues, I did not find it so;
and, as a recent writer has said, “the
Literature syllabus at Sydney is closely
similar to those at the majority of Aus-
tralian Universities, as a glance at the
relevant handbooks would show. Are
they all Leavisite?”
Of course they are not; none of them
is, It is not a feature of Goldberg’s
department, as distinct from others, that
the choice of works it offers is selective.
All courses must be; and if the published
accounts of the “alternative” courses
proposed by Wilkes are accurate, they
are plainly no more “inclusive” than
Goldberg’s.
Nor can one discern in either case an
ideological basis for the selection. Wilkes,
for example, seems to be proposing to
study none of the great English romantic
poets; not one; yet I do not suppose
that, if he offered a reason for this set
of self-denial, it would be in terms either
of his beliefs about the nature of
literature or of his opposition to Leavi-
site exclusiveness. Goldberg may, in his
turn, not prefer the study of Rossetti
to that of Wordsworth; and again, in
accounting for his choice, we do not
need to postulate an ideological fervor.
Well, perhaps it is Goldberg as editor
that harbors the ideologue; perhaps it is
in the “Melbourne Critical Review”,
which he founded and edits, that the
evidence of his allegiances will be found.
One writer claims to have been told that
the review is the “sole purely Leavisite
journal in the world”; and Professor
Gustav Cross, while amiably insisting
that it has an indispensable value for
students of literature, sees it as pro-
moting the “Downing Version” of
English Lit.
The red herring
1%/lany of us think the “Review” over-
solemn and lacking in variety, but
these faults are not due to its being a pro-
longed echo of its master’s voice. In
fact, Professor Cross observes quite
accurately that in total effect it is nothing
like “Scrutiny”, Leavis’ famous journal.
The reason is not that the imitation was
unsuccessfully attempted, but rather
that Goldberg has never really regarded
“Scrutiny” as his model. And I should
have thought that, with all its irritating
faults, the “Review” does not enforce
anything so neat and monolithic that it
can be recognised as a “Downing
Version”.
In short, while not knowing in detail
what has happened in recent years in
the English department of the University
of Sydney, or what wrongs Goldberg’s
opponents think they have suffered, I
see no good reason for considering the
dispute an ideological one. It seems
more likely that the editor of “Honi
Soil” is right when, in his account which
is by far the most interesting and intelli-
gent I have seen, he suggests that the
dissident party is engaging in a “political
reaction from a political situation”, and
he says of the claims made by its
members:
“It is difficult to evaluate these
claims. What is important about them
is that they represent a state of mind
that is different from the one posited
in the ‘Nation’ article. For the most
mistaken part of that magazine’s con-
ception rests in the ideological view
of the situation that it takes more
particularly, that in Professor Wilkes
and his supporters we have a critical
camp established to take the field
against the Leavisites.”
But how, after all, does one recognise
a Leavisite whose attachment to the
master-critic is so strong as to constitute
an ideology? Surely by his slavishness;
and that is the quality which Goldberg
most obviously lacks. How, in any case,
does one recognise an anti-Leavisite? By
the strength of his conviction that those
whom he opposes are Leavisites? By his
preference for Rossetti over Words-
worth? By his disinclination to pay much
attention to Coleridge (a disinclination
shared, incidentally, by Leavis, though
not by Goldberg)? By a penchant for
Meredith combined with a willingness
to ignore Lawrence? By a lack of
interest in American Literature or in
European writers like Dostoievsky and
Chekhov? But, so we were always told,
a provincial preoccupation with “English”
literature is a mark of the
not of their opponents. By an insistence
on “scholarship” as well as on criticism?
But it depends on the particular case
what that even means.
I think myself that no clear view of
the issues affecting the Sydney English
department can be got until people
agree to drop the red herring of
“ideological difference”. God knows,
odd things happen' in English depart-
ments; and the reasons would bear a lot
of dispassionate meditation. Factions
form and break up, tastes become
erected into regulations, the stance of the
martyr is very easily adopted, sensi-
bilities fester and tempers fray over dif-
ferences which an experienced politician
or scientist or historian might well pass
over with a shrug.
Part of the trouble lies, perhaps, in
the nature of that work itself, in the im-
portance, uniqueness and ambiguous
status of the subject as an academic
discipline. It is not simply that the
greater the poem or novel the more it
resists the academic thumbprint; it is
also that any intelligent man professing
the subject is aware of the disproportion
between the work’s capacity to challenge
him and his own capacity to meet the
challenge, even given the most favorable
circumstances. When the conditions in
which the teaching has to be done are
anything but favorable, this awareness
may become a peculiar exacerbation of
his very sense of vocation. And it looks
as if, whatever happens now, the con-
ditions in Sydney are going to be the
reverse of favorable to a criticism which
is humane in spirit and humanist in
basis.


Labor’s Young Turks
The Liberals' lost aura
By BRIAN JOHNS
C. S. WYNDHAM
J. L. MENADUE
R. J. HAWKE
BARRY JONES
The signs are there. They may not be in ad-size neon, but there are indicators
that the Australian Labor Party is creating its own band of “Young Turks” to spur
the Party on a fresh revivalist way. Two signals were flashed last week: one in the
Caucus room at Federal Parliament; the other at a private ALP meeting in Sydney’s
dreary Trades Hall.
The success in Caucus by the closest
of margins 35 votes to 34 of a
move for voting reform for all positions
in the parliamentary party was a vital
tactic to get a greater say in party af-
fairs for younger members.
There is no immediate link between
last week’s Caucus meeting and a gather-
ing of 120 Labor men from Federal elec-
torate councils throughout New South
Wales at the Trades Hall to discuss the
problems of attracting youth to the Labor
banner. But one of the larger stumbling
blocks for those wanting to contribute to
the Labor cause is that they just do not
see places being made for young people
in the Labor hierarchy.
At this stage, the Caucus and Trades
Hall plans are no more than straws in
the wind. But a wind is blowing. It is
important that it is New South Wales
which is feeling the breath of new ideas.
Despite the fact that it is Victoria which
has brought the greatest odium on the
Labor Party in the last decade, it has been
in the Victorian ALP branch that there
has been the strongest current of youth-
ful energies and ideas.
Little of the sort has happened in more
respectable New South Wales. It was
an event when Labor Opposition leader
Mr J. B. Renshaw called on members of
the Sydney University Fabian Society
for assistance in preparing his recent
Budget speech. It took the shattering
defeat in May to bring this about.
The stifling of ideas from the peri-
meter of the inner Labor circle in New
South Wales has been eased by the acti-
vities of the deputy leader of the
Federal Opposition, Mr Gough Whitlam.
Not an intellectual himself, Mr Whitlam
has made enthusiastic and intelligent use
of outside advisers, extending well beyond
his home State. The influence of these
advisers is readily apparent in Whit-
lam’s speeches on housing, urban living,
education, health, northern develop-
ment. The deputy leader’s informal
liaison with outside experts has been
taken a giant step forward by the fede-
ral secretary of the ALP, Mr Cyril
Wyndham.
The establishment of the national ALP
secretariat in Canberra and Wyndham’s
energetic organising ability has brought
a tremendous advance in the effectiveness
of ALP policy committees. Striking
evidence of this was given at the Federal
ALP Conference in Sydney when recom-
mendations and reports from these com-
mittees resulted in the re-writing of 60
per cent of the party’s platform. Al-
though this conference failed lamentably
on the major and immediate political
issues of unity tickets, foreign policy
and State Aid and the major internal
issue of the Wyndham proposals for
party reorganisation it did see Labor
emerging as the only party with a
national science policy, for example.
In the current political realities the
Liberal Party might feel safe in ignoring
these beginnings of a Labor revival. At
the last Federal Conference, where in
one way so much was done, it was the
old men and old ideas that exercised
the ultimate hegemony over the Labor
Party. Having backed off from the
pressing issues of defence, foreign policy,
unity tickets and the rest, the Left was
still leading the Labor Party on its
lemming course. Yet, paradoxically, this
Conference result might spring the ulti-
mate threat to the Liberal Party.
His hopes of immediate accession to
the Labor leadership thwarted, Whitlam
has been doing all that he can to get
pre-selection for new-look Labor can-
didates.
Whitlam’s two most notable proteges
are his private secretary, Mr John
Menadue, an economics graduate and for-
mer Treasury official, and Dr Rex Pat-
terson, the controversial champion of
northern development, who has been
compulsorily transferred from his post
of Director of the Northern Division.
Whitlam is certain to be closely associa-
ted with Menadue’s campaign in the
sprawling New South Wales country seat
of Hume, and with Patterson’s cam-
paign in the Queensland seat of Dawson.
There are others of fine promise. The
Sydney seat of St George is being con-
tested by an economics master from
Cranbrook, Mr Malcolm Cameron, in
his early thirties, and in the New South
Wales seat of Parkes two, Mr Don
Sutherland, an accountant, and Mr W.|
Thompson, a oarrister both of whom!
are reported to be close to Mr Whitlam—
are contesting pre-selection against Labor
veteran Mr Haylen. A young electrical
engineer, Mr Brian O’Kane, has been
endorsed for another Sydney seat, Phillipj
At this stage the ranks of bright cam
didates are thin, but the endorsement of
men like Menadue and Patterson hail
already created ripples of interest. There

has been talk that former journalist and
well-known expert on Indonesia, Mr
Bruce Grant, now a lecturer at the Uni-
versity of Melbourne, would welcome the
opportunity of contesting a Federal seat
for Labor. There is also talk that an-
other notable journalist, Mr Rohan
Rivett, would be interested in obtaining
pre-selection. In the past the Victorian
branch of the ALP has had a good
record, perhaps the best, in attracting
well-equipped candidates ACTU advo-
cate Mr Bob Hawke and quiz king
Mr Barry Jones are only two. But the
prospects are not good at present.
Many of those who have previously
given loyal support to the ALP, in spite
of the glaring inadequacies of the ruling
junta, are now consolidating their forces
in the hope of ousting the Victorian ex-
< ecutive. In this situation, because pre-
selection in Victoria is controlled by the
executive, the calibre of candidates is
naturally being affected.
However, if candidates of high calibre
do in fact come forward elsewhere for
seats which Labor has some prospect
of winning, then Labor, for all its pre-
sent divisions, could start a forward
drive of real worry to the Government.
It is the Liberal partner in the coalition
which has most cause for worry on the
score of Parliamentary representation.
The Country Party, assisted by easier
promotion for the young backbencher
to the Ministry, has created a more
youthful image the Minister for the
Interior, Mr Doug Anthony, and the
Minister for Social Services, Mr lan
Sinclair. True, there are young Liberal
Ministers but their impact is diminish-
ed by the static nature of Liberal repre-
sentation.
The Liberals have long lost the aura
of the bold, adventurous days of 1949,
which, thanks to the buccaneering acti-
vities of the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr
J. McEwen significantly still plain
“Black Jack" the Country Party still
carries with it.
McEwen is attempting to broaden the
base of the Country Party with a solid
injection of nationalism. Listen to Mc-
Ewen on world trade, overseas invest-
ment. and you hear the voice of a
leader addressed to the whole of Aus-
tralia. The Country Party’s sectional in-
terests are kept as far as possible within
Cabinet and party rooms.
It is concern with the slowness of
turnover in the Liberal Parliamentary
ranks, and the problem of injecting new
blood, which are big reasons for an
early redistribution and the enlargement
of the size of the House of Representa-
tives.
A miracle might be needed to take
Labor within cooee of government at
the next election, but there are hopes
that Labor will have more men to shout
effectively at the poll.

Melbourne’s Sacred Rites
Cup Day is not for racing
By BATMAN
There are certain ritual days in Mel-
bourne that frighten us old hands
Moomba, Anzac Day, Grand
Final Day, Show Day and Cup Day.
Each one of these days is infinitely sacred
to the Melburnian temperament and, like
all holy days, the ritual never varies.
You can have all the others the
truth is that I’m rather fond of Cup
Day.
At the beginning of November Flem-
ington racetrack is one of the most
beautiful places on earth. One can stand
up there in the grandstand and look
across the hundreds of acres of nicely
manicured green turf; across to the
towers of the City of Melbourne. Mani-
cured? Well, almost: every time the
track is used a platoon of gentlemen
with buckets walk up the straight, care-
fully replacing the divots with handfuls
of earth and seed. Then there are the
flowers four rows of them half a
mile long, every one of them correctly
obeying the VRC calendar. And this
season Melbourne is having its best
season for roses.
Bin let me tell you more of the ritual.
I like the bit when the Governor-General
arrives. His Rolls-Royce moves down
the straight accompanied by mounted
police, and behind at least 100 massed
Highland pipers. That always does some-
thing to my .01 per cent Highland blood.
This year the G-G is His Excellency Lord
Casey, and he should be very moved
by all this because his father was chair-
man of the VRC from 1912-1914. The
Caseys, however, may have to be led
rather gently by the hand. He hasn’t
been observing our sacred rite. The last
time he was at Flemington was during
the First World War, and Lady Casey
hasn’t been there since before she was
married.
Then apart from the G-G, usually it
rates at least three State Governors and
the entire diplomatic corps. With a little
bit of luck it is possible to observe
the arrival of the diplomatic corps,
saris, tophats, the lot. I remember in
1963, Geoffrey Smith, the Premier’s
protocol man, assembled them all out-
side in the car park, then led them in
a grand entrance. It had all the quality
of the head mistress leading the St
Catherine’s crocodile on the Sunday
excursion to St John’s, Toorak.
From 10.30 on there’s the gorgeous,
and extremely tense, battle of the social
writers. The newspaper girls from Syd-
ney, Melbourne and Adelaide, each
armed with a photographer, congregate
at the steps by the champagne bar.
Everybody out there, including the
society ladies from Toorak, and
Vaucluse and Medindie, have a damn
good knowledge of early-edition times.
So the lovely parade starts, of nice
ladies walking back and forth as if
they didn’t really want to get their pic-
tures in the papers.
The other good ritual is in the car
park. The very smart people get into
a car reserve just at the back of the
birdcage. It costs £5 for the day or
£l2 for the week. Competition for the
space is so keen there’s a ballot, and
it’s a darned sight more exciting than
the horse ballot for the Cup. The mem-
bers' car park is always an example
that the rich of this city are in pretty
good shape. I have counted there 30
Rolls-Royces, and that’s without crudely
including the Bentleys. The ritual is to
have lunch there, say, after the second
race. One always has a striped beach
umbrella, collapsible chairs, and it is
absolutely de rigueur to have champagne
and chicken sandwiches. The chauffeur
stands by in attendance to uncork the
bottles. The Rolls-Royces always look
very nice out there, but often I feel
that the large American cars are more
practical, their incredible bonnets and
boots like heliports are much better
for supporting champagne glasses.
But the connoisseur, the real racing
enthusiast, wouldn’t go to the Melbourne
Cup. There’s only one really first class
race on the card. You see, the VRC
couldn’t turn on another race which
might tempt an owner to pull his horse
out of the Cup. The Cup, spread over
a mighty two miles, is a beauty for the
punter. Almost anything can win it, and
anything often has, so the odds always
are lovely. The classic races in England
are mostly weight-for-age affairs, but
the Cup is a handicap, and just possibly
the best handicap horse race in the
world.
The fellow who really loves his

best three-year-olds. There’s the L.K S.
Mackinnon Stakes, a classic race, an open
event for the really top horses. What’s
more there’s the Hotham Handicap, an
almost junior Melbourne Cup. It attracts
the same horses as the Cup under almost
the same weight conditions, and often
it is a downright interesting guide as to
what will happen on Tuesday.
Taking in both the males and the
females, dressing is better than on Cup
Day. Derby Day is really a topper day.
I mean, even if they get the giggles if
you turn up in a topper at Randwick,
it is absolutely done to wear a topper
at Flemington for the Derby. If you
want one in a hurry I would suggest
the IN fashion this year is for the tails
to be grey, topper grey, waistcoat a
rather generous shade of beige, the grey
tie and striped trousers. You can get
the trousers Australian made, but I
would suggest that the tails be cut in
London. Yes, everyone wears them at the
Derby, even Mr Bolte, and Mr Bolte
in a topper is quite somebody to see.
At the Cup it is not essential to wear
a topper. Indeed there’s a school that
feels a topper at the Melbourne Cup
is really a bit much. It would be better
for you to wear a homburg or a bowler.
Last year there were some fearfully
snappy brown bowlers.
'C'or the past three or four years the
A ambitious VRC has tried to make the
Melbourne Cup hit the international big
time. Twice we have been told that Bob
Hope was coming, but twice he did not
attend. For the Cup this year we were
told that 40 were coming from England
and 85 from the US, including at least
three millionaires. Many of the trippers
would be top racehorse breeders, owners
and trainers.
What with wars in Vietnam and India,
riots in. Los Angeles and hurricanes in
Florida and Louisiana, there were heavy
cancellations. Now, according to the
latest figures, 14 are coming from the
US, four from Vancouver, 40 from Hong
Kong, 35 from England, and 700 from
New Zealand. The New Zealand delega-
tion is quite magnificent, more than three
times the number of troops they sent
to Vietnam. Although one hopes that
they are not disappointed. This year, so
far, has been something of a Kiwi
tragedy. No New Zealand horse has won
or even looks like winning.
So all the emphasis is on the fashions
in the field competition and there are
£12,000 in prizes. Even horses have
trouble in getting that kind of money.
This year there are big names coming
out of it. Madame Claud-Helene Neff,
a director of the International Wool
Secretariat, is coming out from Paris.
She had a farewell party in Paris, thrown
by the Australian Ambassador, and
attended by the international fashion
writers. Also coming are the highly pub-
licised models Jean Shrimpton and Chris-
tine Borg. Madame Neff will chair the
judging panel and Miss Shrimpton and
Miss Borg are bringing a trunkload
of garments made by all the top
couturiers. You know how the fashions
in the field work. A team of judges is
on patrol at all meetings, and they
divide up the best-dressed girls into
categories, ensembles under £4O, under
£BO and so on. You may ask how the I
judges can divide the categories, but thej
truth is that those shrewd characters
from Flinders Lane can pick the price of
every stitch down to the last halfpenny.
The judges tour everywhere, except in
the members’ reserve. The really “nice”
people don’t compete in the fashions in
the field.
The prize money for the Cup this
year is up to £30,000, compared to
£20,000 for the Caulfield Cup. The VRC
is playing a fairly crafty game here.
The object is just to keep the Melbourne
Cup as the richest race in Australia. It
is getting plenty of money from the TAB,
and there’s no question, if any other
club turned on the pressure, the VRC
could make the Cup worth £50,000 or
£60,000. But the feeling is that it’s better
for racing in these expensive times to
spread the spoils over a number of races.
Attendance at the Cup, if the sun
shines, should be around 90,000. This
is a marvellous crowd for a race meet-
ing, but, glory be, there were 100,000,
at the Cup back in 1880 when the popiM
lation of Melbourne was 282,000. Work
that out for yourself, it’s better than
one in three of the population. The best
year was Spearfelt’s year in 1926 with
1 18,877. At the Caulfield Cup this yeai
there were 59,000 when it was ratheij
expected that on such a balmy dayj
they would get 70,000. In the late ’fifties
a fair average race crowd was 30,000.!
Now in the TAB era it has settled down
around 27,000.
Spring Racing Carnival is a lovely
time of the year in Melbourne. There’s
an all - round quickening of activi-
ties, a splurge of party giving and a
cameraderie between managing director
and office boy over Cup sweeps. Then
on October 31 there’s another annual
event, the 70th Annual Mass of the
Victorian Racing Fraternity at St
East Melbourne, at 4 p.m. We are told/
that the Fraternity’s Patron Saint is St
Camillus de Lellis, who, before he became
a priest, served in the Neapolitan and
French armies, and was such a confirmed
gambler that he was reduced to destitu
tion. He died in 1614. Let’s hope W|
are not reduced to destitution by Novem'

The Breeders
More than a pastoral business
By BRIAN BUCKLEY
Horses are deceptively fast when viewed from the racecourse grandstand: the
power and pace are resolved into a swinging rhythm which makes a furlong seem a
hundred yards. The speed of the gallop is not so gripping in racing as the visual delights
of color and motion, the drama of the race, and the money.
Yet, the sustained speed of a half-ton
thoroughbred is in itself remarkable. The
winner of next Tuesday’s Melbourne Cup
will be required to average 35 miles per
hour for the two miles, although burden-
ed with lead-bags and jockey weighing
anything from 7 to 9} stone; over the
final furlongs he may need to generate
bursts of speed up to 40 miles per hour.
Only long and arduous months of training
can fit a horse for this challenge, and
only the stoutest thoroughbred bloodlines
can bear the sustained pressure.
The happiest men on the course after
the race are the owner, trainer, and
rider of the winner; the Melbourne Cup
is run for prizes of £30,000, a gold cup,
and sporting immortality, in a nation in
which years are still identified as much
with their Cup winners as their changes
of government. But proudest is the
breeder, a pastoral man whose casual
boast will fall without prompting on
the ears of all future visitors to his
stud: “We’ve produced some good ones
here in our time, including a Cup win-
ner.” For a jockey, winning the Cup
may be only 200 seconds’ hard work, for
the trainer and owner a couple of sea-
sons of care, patience, and expense. But
breeding a Cup winner may be the cul-
mination of a lifetime spent in improv-
ing pastures, buying and trying a wide
range of stallions, and slowly establish-
ing a brood of quality mares.
The risks are sometimes great and the
returns much more uncertain than in
most other primary industries. This is
especially true of investments in new
sires. Most Australasian sires are import-
ed, usually from England, and although
our studmasters can rarely compete with
American, French, and British interests
for the champion stallions of their race-
tracks, each season sees a new team of
overseas sires offering their services.
Some of the most unlikely and least
impressive of these may develop into
top sires commanding many hundreds of
guineas for their services; the best-bred
and best-performed may turn out to be
stud failures. The gambling element,
Which is an essential feature of the racing
ethos, is not much less present in the
stud than in the betting ring. For ex-
ample, the top English middle-distance
horse Arctic Explorer, one of the
finest-bred stallions imported into Aus-
tralia for .years, was purchased by a
Victorian stud for £45,000 a few years
ago and was expected to be a boon to
the Victorian breeding industry. His
progeny, however, have been, with rare
exceptions, remarkably unsuccessful and
Arctic Explorer has been discarded
and shipped to New Zealand.
Even with a successful stallion the
risk of injury is always present as a
threat to profitable hire. The imported
New South Wales sire Pipe of Peace,
whose progeny have won numerous big
races in the last couple of years, and
who now stands for a fee of 800 guineas,
is reported to have injured himself in a
vital zone recently. He is not able
to stand for service this season. The
financial loss will amount to 40 or 50
times 800 guineas. An ever-present
hazard for the new breeder is the danger
of his enthusiasm flagging and patience
growing thin before he has allowed him-
self the chance to make reasonable divi-
dends on his investment. Four years
will normally pass between the purchase
of a property and an overseas sire and
the performance of his progeny on the
racetrack. If the sire is a middle-
distance horse or stayer, his progeny need
at least another couple of years before
their success can be estimated.
Thoroughbred breeding is continually
attracting the enthusiasm of wealthy
manufacturers and merchants for whom
the purchase or establishment of a
stud farm is half an economic invest-
ment and half a rural hobby. The ini-
tial years of waiting for results often
exhaust the patience of men of urban
habits of mind.
But if the risks are considerable, the
rewards may also be magnificent. The
leading Australian sires Star Kingdom
(sire of Sky High and Todman) and
Wilkes (sire of Wenona Girl) have
service fees of 1000 guineas and are
booked out for seasons ahead. The
champion New Zealand stallion Sum-
mertime (sire of Sometime, Sir
Dane) stand for 1000 guineas sterling.
After his brilliant race career was cut
short by injury, Todman, who was
bred in Australia by mating the imported
Star Kingdom with an imported mare,
initially stood for a fee of 400 guineas.
The success of Eskimo Prince and
other offspring of Todman has en-
couraged his owners to raise his fee to
1000 guineas. Apart from the previously
mentioned Pipe of Peace, other top
stallions in Australia are Orgoglio
(sire of Proud Miss), who stands for
800 guineas; Coronation Boy (sire of
L'Orage Boy), for 750 guineas; Rego
(sire of Reisling), for 700 guineas;
Smokey Eyes (sire of New Statesman),
and Better Boy (sire of Craftsman) both
at 500 guineas.
Lower priced than these proven sires,
a great range of English, American,
French, and Australian sires are avail-
able for service fees ranging from 50
to 450 guineas. Whilst the lower priced
of these stallions may do little more than
pay for their own keep, the potential
earnings of the top sires are huge when
multiplied by something between 30 to
50: the number of services which a
stallion may normally perform per sea-
son. The possible earnings of a cham-
pion sire may thus range up to 50,000
guineas per year.
In practice, studs rarely earn this much
directly from service fees because the
best-bred, and best-performed, of the
imported sires are often owned by a
syndicate, who keep half or more of the
services for their own mares. Individual
stallion owners also usually retain a num-
ber of services for home mares. The
progeny of these home-stud matings are
often raced by the breeders themselves,
and sometimes with great success. Two
recent cases of this are the full bro-
thers Fine and Dandy and Time
and Tide, both of whom have won
over £40,000 in stake money. They were
bred by their owners, Messrs W. F. and
F. H. Moses, who are members of the
small syndicate which imported the
champion sire Star Kingdom.
Mr Stanley Wootton, another member
of the Star Kingdom syndicate, has
had even greater success with the off-
spring of mares he has put to that
sire. He has won well over £lOO,OOO in
stakes with such outstanding sprinters as
Todman, Noholme, and Star of
Heaven.
Breeders who use their own well-
performed mares and do not wish to race
the progeny of their matings can earn
huge sums at the annual yearling sales if
their sires are popular. In the case of
Star Kingdom the 13 of his yearlings
put under the hammer at the Sydney

The catch in, driving a Rover 2000 for the
first time is that you have no impression of
speed. We suggest you watch this factor
for the first few days or you’re likely to find
the needle constantly over the legal limit.
This feeling of tranquillity at speed is in-
duced by a multiplicity of factors, most of
them quite revolutionary: The complete

which offer vastly improved roadholding
and safety. The suspension is such that
Car and Driver magazine says, “it will out-
handle any English sports car we can think
of, except the Lotus Elan”. Though accel-
eration can be fierce (0-100 m.p.h. in 45
seconds), you're cradled in bucket seats
that support you in the small of the back
like no others in the automotive world.
Back seat passengers feel disinclined to
“drive” because they, too, have bucket
seats. Instead of the conventional glove
box, there are tilt out bins for driver and*

sales in April this year realised an aggre-
gate of 71,400 guineas, an average price
of 5490 guineas. The 159 sons and
daughters of Star Kingdom who have
been auctioned at the Sydney yearling
sales since they were first offered in
1954 have realised a total of 509,000
guineas. This total is not uneconomic
(even allowing for the fact that many of
his progeny never saw a sale ring) when
compared with the more than £750,000
which Star Kingdom horses have so
far won in stake money.
Apart from the basic circumstance of
an increase in the number of people with
considerable surplus wealth, the major
factor, in the generation of the breeding
boom has been the introduction of the
off-course tote, some of the revenue of
which is returned to racing in the form of
increased stakes. From the Totalisator
Agency Board turnover in Victoria for
the 1964-65 year, over £1,430,000 was
returned to the racing clubs. As a result
the Melbourne Cup, worth £15,000 back
in the pre-TAB afternoons of 1959, now
offers a prize of £30,000; and the Caul-
field Cup of £12,000 five years ago is
now worth £20,000. The impact of the
off-course tote in Victoria, New South
Wales and Queensland is also reflected
in the prize-money being offered by
country clubs.
With records being broken almost
every year there is no doubt that in New
South Wales, New Zealand and South
Australia the thoroughbred breeding in-
dustry is booming as never before. The
average selling price at this year’s sales in
Sydney was more than 1000 guineas on
each of the four days. The average price
of 1220 guineas compared favorably
with the 1964 record of 1065 guineas.
In South Australia, where 68 of the lots
offered brought 1000 guineas, or more,
the average price was nearly 50 guineas
above the record figures of the previous
year. In Victoria, where the average price
of yearlings at this year’s March sale was
only 790 guineas, compared with South
Australia’s 950 guineas and New South
Wales’ 1220 guineas, there was still a big
improvement on the previous year’s
average of 610 guineas.
Although the more expensive horses
always perform best over a period, the
buying of a thoroughbred is always a
. gamble. Champions such as Tulloch
and Phar Lap sold for relatively low
prices, whilst some of the record-priced
yearlings have never won a race. At last
year’s yearling sales in Sydney, 19 lots
were sold for 4000 guineas or more.
Their aggregate price was £119,175. So
far they have returned their owners less
than £20,000 in prize-money, and some
of the more costly among them show no
sign of ever doing so. In fact, more than
half of the total stake winnings of the
19 has been won by the Melbourne-
owned filly Citius. On the other hand
the top-priced yearlings at the 1963
sales, Eskimo Prince and Farnworth,
were the besi two-year-olds of their year.
Eskimo Prince, who cost his big-bet-
ting owner Perc Galea 6200 guineas as a
yearling, had returned £19,025 in race
winnings before he reached three years.
The boom in sales, brought about by
the increase in prize-money, has led a
number of breeders, who raised
thoroughbreds mainly as a hobby and
spent most of their efforts on their other
pastoral and farming interests, to reverse
their balance of time and investment.
Such investment has led to a record
number of new sires being imported into
the country this year.
But it is impossible to predict, with
any accuracy, whether a new sire will
get good winning stock. The intense
British, American, and French com-
petition for top stallions has forced prices
too high for most Australian studs to
be able to afford to import horses which
are outstanding in both breeding and
racecourse performance. Therefore, it
can generally be said of our importation#
that they are either good racehorses or
very well bred, but not both.
The major trend in the purchase of
stallions in recent years has been the
formation of syndicates of breeders who
take shares in a new stallion which

serv,ces whlch use , for * e ' r

ON THE MARGIN
High Noon at Sydney U
had a hunch there might be
trouble after the installation of Aus-
tralia’s flrst Leavisite prof. He is Sam
Goldberg, Challis Professor of English
Literature at the University of Sydney.
The disciples of the eminent English
critic F. R. Leavis, among whom Pro-
fessor Goldberg is numbered, are
characterised by moral seriousness. To
put it crudely, they regard literature as a
pill to do you good, rather than a lolly to
be enjoyed. There may well be some truth
in their theory. Reading a good .book
does make you feel it has done you
good. But they are apt to make enemies
by reason of the severity of their judg-
ments. To the authors who meet their
special standards they accord intense
loyalty: against those who do not, they
issue thunderous pronouncements of
anathema and excommunication.
The expected conflict of views in the
Sydney School of English has evidently
come about. In future, as well
as Professor Goldberg’s literature
course, an alternative and in-
evitably rival course will be
given under Professor G. A.
Wilkes, who is Professor of Aus-
tralian Literature but teaches
English literature, too. The in-
side story of this schism has been kept
quiet. In the hope of finding out what
happened, I visited Sydney University
and questioned an old-timer there. This
is, verbatim, what he told me:
Yes sir, Melbourne Sam has shore
livened things up on the Eng. Lit. range.
Sam learned to handle his hardware
riding herd for Old Man Leavis, the
fastest gun in Cambridge. Even at nigh
on 70 the Old Man filled Dangerous
Charley Snow full of lead, remember.
Sam’s got a notch on his gun for when
he beat C. S. Lewis to the draw.
He brought a team of hell-raisers here
with him. There was Tommy the Kid,
who once put a slug into Chuck Dickens;
Hairy Ted, a wild boy from the fens;
and Pistol-Packin’ Maggie, a purty gal
who could shoot it out with the best.
Some literary folks were plumb scared.
But Slim Wilkes over at the Triple Oz
outfit jest laughed. “Efn Melbourne
Sam Aggers ter trade lead, I'm waitin’,”
he drawled.
One night Sam and his boys were play-
ing draw poker at the Lady Chat Saloon.
Sam is an amigo of the landlord, Dave
Lawrence.
Suddenly in walked Slim Wilkes with
a bunch of tough hombres Gunsmoke
Gus Cross, Tony Trollope, and Dago
Dan Rossetti. Everyone was quiet as
they went up to the bar.
Then Melbourne Sam’s voice came
from the poker table: “I reckon Mad
Perce Shelley’s jest a no-good romantic
varmint.” i
Slim Wilkes turned round. He said
evenly: “Perce Shelley is an old pardner
of mine, stranger. You talk like a dawg-
gone Leavisite.” He gave a mocking
laugh.
In a flash Melbourne Sam’s gun hand
moved, and Slim was looking down the
rim of a barrel.
Sam rasped: “When yuh call me that,
don’t smile.”
Behind the bar Dave Lawrence
grasped a Mexican statuette of curious
design. He was ready for trouble.
Slim Wilkes and his men backed out.
But folks knew the feudin’ had
begun.
A few days later Gunsmoke
Gus galloped up to the bunk-
house at the Triple Oz. He
gasped: “Melbourne Sam’s boys
have drilled Perce Shelley!”
Slim Wilkes turned to his
followers. Chuck Dickens and grizzled
Alf Tennyson had joined them they
had scores to pay off.
“Git yore shootin’ irons,” said Slim
quietly. “We’re gonna mosey over and
look fer them coyotes.”
They met up with Melbourne Sam’s
men in Eliot Gulch. Dave Lawrence and
Fat Hank James were with them.
“Where’s the pizen-snake thet riddled
Perce Shelley?” yelled Slim.
In the gunplay that followed, Slim's
boys had the best of it. Chuck Dickens
put a bullet into Tommy the Kid. Dan
Rossetti shot a hole in Dave Lawrence’s
sombrero. Somebody winged Pistol-
Packin’ Maggie. Then Sam’s mob high-
tailed into the mesquite.
There’s been shootin’ ever since. Hank
James and Tony Trollope were both hit
bad. Jack Milton’s been dry-gulched . ..
As the old-timer spoke, a puzzled
tenderfoot came up. He said: “I cain’t
figger whether to join up with Melbourne
Sam’s outfit or Slim Wilkes.”
The clock was striking twelve. Fronil
opposite ends of the street two men
walked slowly towards each other. They l
were Slim and Sam.
The old-timer spat thoughtfully. He
said to the tenderfoot: “Wait, son.
Mebbe you’ll know soon.”

Not So Much a Motor Car,
More a Way of Life
Are you the right sort of person for a Rolls-Royce ... ?
From ALEXANDER FRATER in London
The suburbs of Crewe, like the
suburbs of all English midland
towns, are a maze of red-bricked
streets and aproned wives slumped in
doorways, smoking. This room-at-the-
top milieu tends to heighten the shock
when, above the wet and slatey shingles,
you suddenly glimpse a water tower
bearing two of the most evocative words
in the trendsetter’s phrase book —Rolls-
Royce. “There it is, squire,” said the
works driver who had met me at the
station. “The motoring man’s Mecca.”
Before the administration block a new
Silver Shadow was being paraded for
the benefit of TV cameras. Something
• —a gear, perhaps—ground softly and all
about us windows flowered with a host
of pale, worried faces. “Will they let
you drive that?” I asked the chauffeur.
“Will they let me fly the Concord?” he
responded, rolling his eyes and ushering
me through the main doors. A commis-
sionaire with Coldstream Guards and
Western Desert stamped on his very
braces presented the visitors’ book, mur-
mured “Pray follow, sah,” and led me
to the managing director’s suite.
Dr Llewellyn Smith sits in a pale,
panelled office behind a tidy desk with
a tiny, silver Rolls-Royce mounted on
the ash tray. He is lean, keen-eyed and
crisply purposeful. “I’m flying off to the
Paris Motor Show in a couple of hours,”
he said. “We’re unveiling the Shadow
there, you know.” I did not ask whether
he was confident; he heads a venerable
institution; the question would be tanta-
mount to asking the Warden of All Souls
if he can read. There was, nevertheless,
a sort of pre-curtain tension in the room.
An assistant entered and said, “It’s time
you were going, doc. You have to catch
that plane.”
“Yes,” said Dr Smith. He looked at
me. “Would you care for some tea?”
“No, thank you,” I said. “I had some
on the train.”
“British Railways tea,” he said, with
a slightly pained expression, “always
tastes as though it had been boiled in
an oil drum. What would you like to
know?”
“Well,” I said. “Who designed the
new model?”
“Our engineers,” he said. “They
dreamt up the basic concept and put it
on the wall and then we all looked at it
and said ‘I don’t like that bulge there’
and they’d take it down and change it.
They’d put up the revised version and
somebody would say ‘Those door-
handles should be lower’ so they’d pull
it down and change the door-handles.
We carried on like that for ten years and
the Silver Shadow is the result.”
The assistant fidgeted. “It’s time you
were going, doc,” he said.
He rose a quarter of an hour later,
consigned me to the care of a Mr Hook
and a Mr Dummett and obediently went
to Paris. Messrs. Hook and Dummett
led me through rows of echoing steel
sheds and admitted that a job with Rolls
is a way of life. Seven hundred men, for
example, attended the 25 years service
dinner held the previous month and Mr
Hook referred to them as freshmen; he
had been with the firm for thirty-eight
years and Mr Dummett had been with
it for forty.
We went to the body shop where
teams of grave men, in the grand, old
be-smocked blacksmith manner, were
beating and buffing the- naked steel
bodies. They beat and buff any given
body for three days then dip it in an
emulsion wash, two cold rinses, a phos-
phate solution, two more cold rinses
and a tank of distilled water. The thing
is now sterile enough to have a surgeon
perform a lobotomy on its bonnet. It is
dropped in yellow acid primer, sub-
merged in grey primer and baked in an
oven at 335 degrees F. After it has been
sprayed with red filler paint, the joints
are sealed (twice) and it proceeds wilting
to the rubbing deck.
Eight strong men with hoses and pads
move in belligerently, scrubbing and
honing beneath bright lights, searching
for inconsistencies, for minute bumps
and hollows in the skin missed by the
buffers. When they are satisfied the car
passes to a checker who is paid not to
be. He broods over it, hawk-eyed, draws
chalk circles around any flaws that he
can find and sends it back. This routine
happens twice. Then a sealer coat is
added, followed by the first color coat,
before the body returns to the rubbing
deck and the whole honing, searching
and chalk-marking programme is re-
peated. A second color coat is added
and the body is finally ready for the
first stage of the assembly line. They
haven’t even started building the car
and the process has taken nearly a
month.
We went to lunch. The executives’
dining-room is panelled and carpeted. A
dozen of us ate lamb chops off bone
china and drank from cut-glass; con-
versation was relaxed and amusing. The
chief engineer discussed “New Yorker”
cartoons and a man recently returned
from overseas said Tokyo night life was
the best in the world. Probing failed to
elicit why and the conversation turned,
inexorably, to cars. I sensed the con-
trolled tension that had been evident
with the managing director; in two days
their car wa, to be released to a curious
and critical world and, over coffee, they
brooded over the imponderables. I had
never thought of Rolls-Royce being
fallible and the concept put me off my
"It gets me there and it brings me back."

gruyere and soda crackers. I asked how
they had arrived at the name Silver
Shadow. “We discussed it over lunch,”
they said. “Here. With Doc. We had
originally planned on calling it the Silver
Mist but our Zurich agent rang up in
hysterics and said the word meant
manure in German and would we think
again for God's sake.”
Cigarettes were passed about in a
silver casket. We strolled, at senior
common-room pace, out into the hazy
autumn sun. “Let’s have a peek at the
premount line,” said Mr Hook, and we
stood, in appropriate attitudes of respect,
and saw the plumbing and sound-proof-
ing installed. On the assembly line the
wheels and engine a vast, gleaming
thing that looked like the powerplant of
a Trident jet were added and Mr
Hook sighed with satisfaction. “Come
and see the wood shop,” he said. They
take their wood seriously at Rolls-Royce.
It comes to the factory as logs and goes
out as mirror-like veneer lining the doors,
dashboard and walls. Each car contains
considerable quantities of American
walnut. English ash, Honduran mahog-
any, Yugoslavian beech and Caucasian
veneer. The wood in each vehicle is
taken from the same portion of the log
and the patterns throughout the car are
absolutely identical, even to the knot-
holes. From the moment the first coat
of varnish is applied, it takes six weeks
to polish and prepare the wood for in-
stallation.
Eight cows gave their lives
trim, or leather, shop is next door
and it is stacked with the finest hides
in the world. Each vehicle contains 350
square feet of leather. “Eight cows,”
said the foreman with a certain relish,
“give their lives for every waggon we
put on the road.” We returned to the
assembly line. Each car now bore a
ticket inscribed (in copperplate script)
with the owner’s name. “Would you,”
I said, indulging in a lunatic flight of
fancy, “sell me a Rolls-Royce?”
“Certainly,” said Mr Dummett with
a bright smile and a miniscule pause that
spoke volumes. Ah, said the pause, but
are you the sort of person with whom
we should like to be associated? Do
you lead a sober and industrious life?
Do you covet other men’s wives? Do
you care for your feet? “We know the
vast majority of our customers by name,
of course,” said Mr Hook pointedly.
“Many by their first names. We like to
know who they are and how they’re
doing.”
“Quite,” I said, reflecting that owning
a Rolls is like having a knighthood: one
is obliged to eat, drink, dress, love and
live the part. “Come and see the Silver
Lady shop,” said Mr Dummett effusively.
The Silver Lady shop is full of girls; it
hums with song and talk and tiny
screams; the handful of men present are
grouped grimly in a corner, for defence
purposes, and periodically one of them
sallies out on to the floor to make an-
other mascot. The mould is fashioned
from creamy, oouth American wax
which undergoes a complex meta-
morphosis to emerge as the most famous
motor car symbol in history. The car
itself has changed out of all recognition
but the Silver Lady, archaic and very
Victorian, hasn t and is never likely to.
Like a couple? ’ said Mr Hook.
A couple of what?” I asked.
Wax ladies, he said. Paint them,
mount them on teak and you have a nice
pair of bookends. Make the gentleman
a pair, Bert. Souvenir. ’
Carrying them, still warm, in a paper
bag, we con.inued on our way, saw the
testing shop, polishing shop, checking
shop and, finally, sitting plumply under
lights in the finishing shop, a sleek and
gleaming car being checked and tested
for the very last time. We said our good-
byes and I was driven to the station,
In the train I cannoned into a fat
lady wearing boots. “Watch where
you’re goin’,” she snapped. I opened my
paper bag and saw that the wax ladies
had lost their wings,
“Madam,” I said, opening a window
and casting them into the green Cheshire
countryside, “you have just severed my
sole link with the Beautiful People.”
She scratched a dewlap thoughtfully,
“ ’Ere,” she said. “What did you throw
out?”
“The fragments of a dream,” I said,
and proceeded to the dining-car for fruit
cake and coffee

THE MYTH
OF WINSTON
CHURCHILL
An Agonising Reappraisal
By GORONWY REES
When the trumpeter had blown the
the last reveille, when the gun
carriage had discharged its bur-
den on the quay and the journalists had
exhausted all their treasuries of special
prose, then, surely, the time had come
when one might reasonably wonder what
it had all been about. Yet it seemed
almost blasphemous to ask such a ques-
tion. For a week we had been encom-
passed by so vociferous a cloud of wit-
nesses to Churchill’s greatness, obituaries
had been furbished up at the last moment
to ensure that no possible extravagance
had been omitted from their praise, the
television had luxuriated in funeral tri-
butes, the dead man’s literary agent, his
valet, his detectives, had scraped the
barrel of memory for the last threadbare
fragments of reminiscence.
A large and lucrative industry had
been founded on his death. Special
supplements rolled from the presses, new
editions of his works proliferated, the
voice of Dimbleby was loud in the land.
And to crown it all there had been the
marvellous ceremony of his funeral, the
tight blue-and-white square of the naval
escort drawing the gun carriage, the
guardsmen bowed over their reversed
rifles, the voices and the trumpets echo-
ing in the dome of St Paul’s, the tiny
launch that carried him away from it all
down the river. There had never been
such a wake since Valentino’s. How could
one have any doubt what it all meant?
For the answer was surely obvious.
It was generally agreed that Churchill
was the greatest; as Englishman, states-
man, orator, writer, historian, artist,
most of all it would seem, als mensch :
Soldier, scholar, sportsman he,
A ’twere all life’s epitome.
But even such lines would hardly have
satisfied Churchill’s panegyrists. They
might have suggested that Churchill was
in some way human, whereas what was
wanted was to show that he was of
another order of nature from the pyg-
mies who had surrounded him, truly a
colossus who had bestridden the petty
world. One expected some new planet,
fiery and luminous, to blaze out in the
heavens when he was translated into im-
mortality.
“The Times”, to its own satisfaction,
in its memorial supplement, almost struck
the required note: “He belongs to the
,country, he belongs to the Common-
wealth, he belongs to the world, now he
belongs to the ages.” Almost, but not
quite. “Universe” for “world”, and
“eternity” for “ages” would really have
captured the Pecksniff touch.
(By arrangement with “Encounter
London.)
“He had been proved so
utterly and demonstrably
wrong on almost every
other important political
issue . .
If all the wonderful entertainments
which the Earl Marshal has in his reper-
toire, ready for every occasion, from a
cricket match to a coronation, had in
eluded a ceremony of canonisation, it
would surely have been produced at this
moment. It would have been all the more
appropriate because canonisation is apt
to provoke just those symptoms of col-
lective hysteria which were displayed in
the week following Churchill’s death
and culminated on the day of his funeral.
To anyone who has even the slightest
resistance to hyperbole, it was precisely
those symptoms that gave a slightly sinis-
ter and creepy quality to the whole pro-
ceedings. One could not help feeling that
so public an extravagance of grief and
mourning could not really have been
inspired by one man, that it was not
Churchill the nation was burying, but a
part of their own history, not a statesman
but an empire, not a hero but themselves
as they once were and never would be
again.
Fortunately, amid the spate of reminis-
cences. lamentations, funeral orations,
and memorial tributes which Churchill’s
death, or its approach, inspired, there
were a few which were worthy of their
subject. It was, for instance, an admirable
idea to republish, in book form, Isaiah
Berlin’s essay on Mr Churchill in 1940,
which first appeared in 1949 in the
“Atlantic Monthy” and the “Cornhill
Magazine” as a review of the first volume
of Churchill’s war memoirs. Written pri-
marily for an American audience and
while Churchill was still alive, it does
not fall short of the hyperbole to which
he was condemned when dead, but with
more justification because it captures
exactly the feeling of admiration, grati-
tude, almost reverence, which Churchill
inspired in Britain at the one period of
his life when he performed an indispens-
able service to his country.
Churchill in 1940 was indeed a phe-
nomenon that is not likely to be repeated
in our history, for 1940 was perhaps the
last time that Britain would ever exer-
cise an independent and decisive role
in world affairs, and in Churchill a man
was found who rose to the occasion with
all the formidable force and energies of
his nature. For that moment at least an
indestructible bond was forged between
himself and the British people, each
trusted each other completely, both knew
exactly what part they had to play in the
crisis they faced together. The mourning
provoked by Churchill’s death was very
largely inspired by grief that such a
moment would never occur again, it was
a nation mourning for his and its own
past greatness.
Isaiah Berlin'does not take account of
the possibility that it was the nation and
the moment which made the man, and
not vice versa. Such hypotheses are un-
profitable and in any case were not neces-


sary to his purpose. What he admirably
and vividly expresses is how, at a par-
ticular moment of time, the British
people found the man that enabled him
to respond to all the demands that were
made upon him. So remarkable a con-
juncture of events, so striking a person-
ality, the sense of a world at a turning
point in history, stir Isaiah Berlin as they
stirred the subject of his essay. He ex-
presses this feeling so vividly, with so
much brio and eloquence, with so much
imagination tempered by fine and acute
analysis, that he really makes one feel
for a moment what the world looked like
through Churchill's eyes.
Be he also notices, almost in passing,
one aspect of Churchill which is fre-
quently overlooked. He contrasts Roose-
velt’s “gay and apparently heedless aban-
don” with “a dimension of depth” in
Churchill, “evidences of seasons of ago-
nised brooding and slow recovery”, and
“a corresponding sense of tragic possi-
bilities, which Mr Roosevelt’s light-
hearted genius instinctively passed by”.
It is perhaps on this, rather than on his
more flamboyant and superficially more
attractive qualities, that one might find
a real claim to greatness for Churchill.
Yet, strangely enough, it was precisely
this which for the greater part of his
political career created an almost un-
bridgeable gulf between him and the
overwhelming majority of his fellow-
countrymen.
Isaiah Berlin is justified in writing as
he does about Churchill in 1940, with
such generous and exalted enthusiasm,
because he is writing about a triumph,
for a man and for a country, in which
they were so closely identified that it
would be impossible to distinguish what
part each played in it. But in fact
this identification was only momentary.
It persisted indeed, to a degree, through-
out the war, though never again at so
intense a pitch, yet at the same time the
British electorate, under the pressure of
the war, was slowly formulating political
conclusions which were at the opposite
pole to Churchill’s and led to his abrupt
fall from power in 1945.
Thus Churchill in 1940 was at a
wholly exceptional point in his life, and
exceptional most of all in the relation-
ship which he established with his coun-
trymen. For the most striking feature of
Churchill’s long political career is that,
for all his brilliant qualities, or perhaps
because of them, he was repeatedly and
for long periods rejected by the British.
Until the Second World War, he never
won their love or trust, and his political
following was confined to a small group
of personal friends, for the most part of
no great weight or significance. Neither
the nation nor a party acknowledged him
as a leader.
When, as at the moment of his death,
one was invited to regard him as a great
national statesman, hero and father in
one, it was difficult to remember that for
the greater part of his career he had
been an object of suspicion, mistrust, or
indifference, and that up to the war it
had been singularly barren of any solid
or permanent political achievement.
As a spur to memory one could not do
better than to read Lady Violet Bonham-
Carter’s “Winston Churchill As I Knew
Him”. It is brilliantly written, so well
indeed as to make one regret that Lady
Violet during her long life has not writ-
ten more and talked less. And if Isaiah
Berlin’s essay is written in a spirit of
hero-worship, Lady Violet’s book is the
story of a love affair, and like all true
love affairs it reveals rather more about
both the lover and the loved one than
its author might suspect. Like all love
stories, also, is a story of youth, in the
years when Lady Violet was a young
girl whose father was Prime Minister of
Britain and Churchill a brilliant young
politician on the make.
. . It was almost impos-
sible to take him seriously
as a politician, much less
a statesman ”
Lady Violet endows her story with all
the glamor and charm of young love seen
with the nostalgic hindsight of the old;
moreover, the glamor and charm suffuse,
like a golden glow, her vivdly painted
picture of the society, and the age, in
which her passionate devotion was
formed. Sometimes one feels as if one
were reading a novel by Ouida.
It is an essential feature of its plot that
her hero, on his first appearance, is
already a man who in his childhood and
youth has had the bitter experience of
being rejected. No man ever had a father
who was more a man after his own
heart than Churchill. The brilliant, tur-
bulent, immensely gifted Lord Randolph
Churchill, who revolutionised British poli-
tics between 1870 and 1880, and then
guttered out like a spent candle, had all
the qualities which Churchill himself
admired, together with a personal charm
which he himself never possessed, cour-
age, audacity, loyalty, a formidable capa-
city for hard work, a kind of recklessness
which carried him like a meteor across
the political sky.
Yet such a man, made for a boy’s love
and devotion, treated his son as if he
were a stranger, and with a chilly dis-
approval that amounted to contempt.
“He seemed,” Churchill wrote, “to have
the key to everything, or nearly every-
thing worth having. But if I even began
to show the slightest idea of comrade-
ship, he was immediately offended, and
when I once suggested that I might help
his private secretary to write some of his
letters, he froze me into stone.” Yet
his father’s coldness could not kill
Churchill’s love and devotion.
The pattern of rejection which
Churchill experienced in his childhood
and youth was to repeat itself consistently
during his political life. Lady Violet em-
phasises that despite her father’s own
affection for Churchill, and acute appre-
ciation of his brilliant intellectual gifts,
Churchill was never able to win the trust
or confidence of his colleagues in the
great Liberal government of 1906, or the
confidence of the Liberal Party. He was
like some brightly colored bird of para-
dise, whose gaudy plumage made him
suspect to birds of a more sober hue.
Sometimes his antics made him almost a
joke.
“He is full of the poor,” wrote Charles
Masterman, “whom he has just dis-
covered. He thinks he is called by pro-
vidence to do something for them.”
And when after the fall of Lloyd George,
Churchill through principle or lack of
principle deserted the Liberals and re-
joined the Conservatives, they received
him, even though they gave him office,
with equal hostility and mistrust. Their
feelings were appropriately expressed in
a popular biography, published in 1931,
entitled “The Tragedy of Winston Chur-
chill”, in which he is depicted as a bril-
liant politician brought to ruin by his
own faults, of overweening ambition,
lack of principle, personal disloyalty, and
irretrievable egotism. “Punch” carica-
tured him trying on one of his eccentric
hats before a mirror and remarking: “As
usual, it’s too small.”
Lady Violet reminds us again and
again how deeply the solid core of the
Conservative Party hated and mistrusted
Churchill, as they had hated and mis-
trusted his father. They would have been
glad if he had suffered the same political
extinction and at one time it seemed
likely that he might. They pursued him
with a venom and vindictiveness only
equalled by the sycophancy of their
adulation in his declining years. In the
’thirties any Conservative politician with
an eye to power regarded Churchill as
an incorrigible advocate of lost causes,
out of touch with the electorate and with
the people, doomed forever to sterile
opposition.
One of the most striking features of
Churchill’s career up to the war is that
he was never able to organise, either
within or outside the Conservative Party,
a solid and coherent body of public
opinion in support of his policies. Out-
side the Conservative Party, indeed, he
was regarded with just as much mistrust

as within, though he won the sympathy
and admiration of a fragment of the
Labor Party by his hostility to Hitler
and to National Socialist Germany. But
for most of the Left, a policy of re-
armament was all the harder to swallow
precisely because Churchill advocated it.
He was, after all, a man of blood, the
man of Gallipoli, of intervention in Rus-
sia, of Tonypandy, of the “British
Gazette”. Now that he advocated arms
and the covenant, it could only be for
the wrong reasons, in the cause of war
and not of peace.
We are not to suppose that such feel-
ings, of doubt, suspicion, mistrust, and
downright hostility, disappeared over-
night when war came and Churchill re-
joined the government. There were many
Conservatives who never forgave Chur-
chill for opposing the policy of appease-
ment, or for supplanting their shabby
angel of peace, Neville Chamberlain,
who, strangely enough, was capable of
inspiring the most intense loyalty and
devotion in his followers. And when
finally, in 1940, Churchill became Prime
Minister, it was not as a leader whom the
entire nation had summoned unani-
mously to power as the only possible
savior of an apparently ruined cause. It
was simply because Halifax was unwill-
ing to undertake the burden of the Pre-
miership and Churchill was the only
other Conservative politician under
whom Labor would serve in a coalition
government. If there had been any other
available, he would, from the point of
view of the nation as a whole, have done
just as well at that moment.
The attempt, at the time of his death,
to represent Churchill as a kind of father
of his people is essentially a falsification
of his entire political career and especi-
ally of his long and complicated relation-
ship both with the British electorate and
with the political parties of which he was
alternately a member. The election of
1945, with, once again, its total rejection
of Churchill, was evidence that, even
though he retained the nation’s gratitude
for his war-time achievements, it was not
sufficient to secure the return of him and
his party to power. Moreover, during
the election, Churchill himself did not
fail to reveal one of his most striking
political weaknesses. For if, for most
of his political life, the British people
profoundly mistrusted Churchill, he on
the other hand never understood them.
By nature he had none of that instinc-
tive sense of a nation’s deepest emotions,
wishes, aspirations, prejudices, which is
commonly taken to be one of the marks
of greatness in a statesman and in this
respect he completely lacked the mysteri-
ous insights of a Lincoln, a Roosevelt,
a Lloyd George, of a Hitler. Isaiah Ber-
lin calls Roosevelt, as compared with
Churchill, “frivolous”. But he also makes
one realise that Roosevelt’s enormous
sensitivity to the moods and feelings of
the masses, and his capacity to give them
concrete political expression, conferred
on his policies a kind of moral authority
to which Churchill, as a peacetime poli-
tician, could never aspire. And when
Churchill was returned to power, it was
not as a result of a gift of national leader-
ship, or as a statesman of genius, but
purely and simply as a party politician
presiding over a singularly undistin-
guished administration.
Lady Violet Bonham-Carter, for all
her adoration of Churchill, makes it clear
that the kind of blindness Churchill
showed towards the deepest needs and
wants of his countrymen in the mass
applied equally in his personal relation-
ships. He did not easily inspire affection
or even liking, except in a very limited
circle, which included, among his closest

SPEEDING
SYDNEY'S TRAFFIC
Australian Owned — Australia Wide
Vol. 2, No. 6
October, 1965
Sydney is Australia’s “drive-in” city. Every day
thousands of cars choke all main arteries leading
to Sydney. Traffic control is a constant headache
and police and traffic authorities are forever trying
new methods of coping with the peak-hour flow.
To ease congestion on the northern side of the
Harbour, the Warringah Expressway is being built
from the northern approaches to the Sydney
Harbour Bridge, to serve the city’s north-eastern
suburbs.
The construction contract for the first section of
1.5 miles was awarded to Messrs. Reed & Stuart
Pty. Ltd. Already the work is well under way, with
the excavations being cut.
To carry out the excavation work a joint venture
company, Highway Constructions Pty. Ltd., was
formed between Reed & Stuart and Brambles
Industries Ltd., and £0.5 million plant from this
company is constantly at work on the project.
The Expressway will reduce the heavy volume of
traffic at peak hours on local streets in North
Sydney, and by increasing the capacity of the
approaches to the Harbour Bridge will enable it
to work at nearer its full capacity.
The total expenditure on this project is expected to
be in the region of £40,000,000 and will involve
the construction of about 9 miles of super highway,
but only the first section of one-and-a-half miles
from the Harbour Bridge to Miller Street at
Cammeray is under construction at this time. For
this section, approximately 1,500,000 cubic yards
of material will have to be excavated and moved,
and this is being done by bulldozers, drills,
mechanical shovels and tipping trucks from High-
way Constructions, which is under the technical
management of Brambles Industrial Services,
Sydney.
Eight overhead bridges will be built for the first
section, which will take eight separate traffic lanes,
with a reversible flow system for peak hour in and
out traffic.
When completed, the new Warringah Expressway
should speed up traffic from the North Side of
Sydney, meanwhile the construction work provides
an ever-changing spectacle for daily road and rail
travellers.


CRANES CAN DO LIGHT LIFTS...AND GET INTO HOT WATER TOO
...AND GET INTO HOT WATER TOO
A man in a personnel box does not weigh much, but a heavy
mobile crane had to be used to lift him to the top of a
chimney stack at the Norwood, South Australia, plant of
Commix, to mount a small wireless antenna.
The heavy crane was necessary because of the extreme
height of the chimney, and for the lift, a 100-foot jib was
mounted. The antenna was installed by the Telecommuni-
cation Company of Australia, and was placed 100 feet up
to give greater range for a radio transmitter.
. . . Hot water service installation, that is! A Brambles
crane fitted with a 70-foot jib and fly attachment was
called in at the Royal Newcastle Hospital to assist in
the installation of a 1,000-gallon hot water tank. The
tank had to be placed in the boiler room, and because
of its size, the only means of access was by way of
the roof. A twelve-foot-square hole was opened up in
the boiler room roof and the crane lowered the tank
into position.

Extra-heavy pieces of cargo on board the
S.S. Cap Villano which berthed in Sydney
recently resulted in a call to CHEP from
the Austral Stevedoring Coy. for a fork

lbs. The fork lift made light work of the
cargo as it carried it from ship-side to
storage sheds.

SAFETY IS EVERYBODY’S BUSINESS...
The need for combined efforts by the Road Transport Industry, customers and
public authorities in saving lives on the road is highlighted by this recent mail-
ing piece distributed by Brambles in New South Wales.


STAFF TRAINING
An “In Company’’ training programme is being conducted in the Sydney Branches of the Transport Group. Planned and
directed by Brambles Executives, professional staff trainers are conducting the courses and bringing both wide
experience of other industries and a fresh personality amongst the Brambles staff.
The current courses are “Salesmanship” and “Supervisor Training,” and in each there is emphasis on group discussion
and case studies. The latter are taken from Company procedures and situations which occur in the daily work of
Supervisors, Sales Staff and other key personnel. The “Salesmanship” course consists of 12 two-hour sessions, on three
mornings each week. Important segments deal with customer service and some aspects of marketing. Similar courses
will be conducted in other Branches.
Pictured is the Supervisor Training Group in the staff canteen at the Marrickville Branch, where they meet one night each
week for the six weeks of the course.
LEAPFROG ... on the grand scale
Construction work on the No. 2 Ore Jetty at
B.H.P.’s Whyalla Steelworks called for cranes to
carry out structural work at the seaward end of
the jetty . . . accessible only by water.
Brambles’ worked closely with B.H.P. engineers
to devise a means of using mobile cranes with
water transport to carry the material over the
water and place it in position.
A 60-ton Lima crane and a 26-ton Steelweld
mobile crane were placed on a pontoon, 80 feet
long and 26 feet wide. A tug towed the pontoon
to the seaward end of the Ore Jetty and the
60-ton crane lifted the smaller unit on to the
structural work of the jetty itself. The pontoon
still carrying the Lima crane returned to shore
and a second 26-ton crane took the place of the
Lima on the pontoon.
The pontoon was towed again to the end of the
jetty and moored. A third 26-ton crane was
on-shore handling fabricated steelwork into a
barge. A tug took each loaded barge to the jetty
where the crane on the pontoon lifted the steel-
work to the jetty for its partner to place in
position.
The crane on the pontoon was afloat for several
weeks, working in choppy water, caused by the
normal windy weather at that time of the year.
Extreme care had to be taken in the positioning
of the crane on the pontoon, and the ballasting
of the pontoon, to prevent it from rolling when
the crane slewed with its load.


friends, such very unpleasant characters
as Lords Birkenhead and Beaverbrook.
His obsessive concentration on whatever
concerned him most at the moment was
one of his most remarkable gifts, but
it was also an effective barrier to com-
munication with others or to any under-
standing of their problems and difficul-
ties, unless they happened to coincide
with his own.
This unawareness of the needs, the in-
terests, the legitimate preoccupations of
others, was a weakness in Churchill as a
man and, more seriously, as a politician
and a statesman. It reflected an egotism
which could see nothing outside the
blinkers of his own imagination which,
if it was intense, was also surprisingly
narrow and often superficial; it made in-
tolerable demands on anyone who had
to work with him and reduced discussion
with him to a not always inspired mono-
logue. Under the fierce and unremitting
pressure of the war it created strains
upon his colleagues which were hardly
to be borne. In Lord Alanbrooke’s
diaries it is possible to trace a feeling
towards Churchill which is something
more than dislike.
Any fair assessment of Churchill's war-
time administration would have to take
into account the question whether Chur-
chill’s incessant bullying of his military
advisers, and his interference in spheres
where his judgment was singularly fal-
lible and erratic, did not in fact hinder
rather than assist the efficient conduct
of the war.
It would be easy, of course, to see
these faults as simply the reverse side of
Churchill’s greatness, the inevitable con-
sequence of his implacable concentration
on the matter in hand, of his conscious-
ness of superior intellectual powers and
spiritual energies which were perfectly
adapted to the crisis which he had to
meet and master. In the same way, it
would be easy to accept Churchill’s long
exclusion from power simply as yet
another example of men’s unfortunate
habit of failing to recognise manifest
genius, and to see in Churchill, during
his years in the wilderness, another pro-
phet who was not without honor save in
his own country, another stone which the
builders rejected but became the head
of the corner, yet this would be, once
again, to falsify the evidence of Chur-
chill’s political career. It would be to
suggest that, in refusing their confidence
to Churchill, the British people and the
British political parties had in some way
been grievously in the wrong. Whereas
the truth is that, over a long period,
Churchill had been guilty of a series of
gross errors that it was almost impossible
to take him seriously as a politician,
much less a statesman.
It is not necessary to go back to Gal-
lipoli, though Mr Robert Rhodes James
is perhaps right to remind us now that
Churchill must take a large part of the
blame for that disaster, both in its plan-
ning and its execution. But he was also
wrong about intervention in Russia, he
was wrong about the return to the gold
standard, his antics in the General Strike
were such that, if his colleagues in the
government had imitated him, it might
have developed into civil war. He was
wrong about India, he was wrong about
Mussolini, about Spain and, initially,
even about Hitler; he was absurdly wrong
about the abdication. No British politi-
cian in the inter-war years had so con-
sistent a record of error and misjudg-
ment, and if this was partly redeemed
by his opposition to Hitler, when once
he had realised what a danger German
rearmament was to Britain, it was a part
of the tragedy of the ’thirties, of what
he himself called “the unnecessary war”,
that Churchill was unable to persuade
others to accept his views largely because
he had been proved so utterly and de-
monstrably wrong on almost every other
important political issue with which he
had concerned himself.
. . His true greatness
lay in his unalterable con-
viction that war , in our
time , is indeed the ulti-
mate reality . . /’
Nor is it possible to see in Churchill’s
political errors, of which some at least
had disastrous political consequences for
the country, any rational or coherent
political philosophy which, however
unpopular at the time, might under
other circumstances prove its essential
worth. They were at best the re-
flection of a purely personal attitude
to life and to politics which was strangely
divorced, except in one single and im-
portant respect, from the realities of his
time, and this no doubt helps to explain
why, up to 1930, he was so singularly
unsuccessful in organising any solid sup-
port behind him. The truth was that,
except in the one crucial case of Ger-
many, he did not have any policies which
were relevant to the situation in which
Britain found herself between the wars.
It might be generally agreed that, on
the eve of the war, Churchill was, as a
politician, a failure, indeed a quite spec-
tacular failure, given his exceptional
qualities both of intellect and character,
one who, with every gift and every
opportunity, after nearly sixty years of
public life, of which thirty had been
spent in high office, had no great legis-
lative or administrative achievement to
his credit, enjoyed the trust and confi-
dence neither of his party nor his coun-
trymen, and seemed doomed to spend
the remainder of his days in futile and
discredited opposition. It is less generally
agreed, or at least avowed, that this
failure was of his own making.
How, then, are we to explain his sud-
den transformation, almost overnight, in
the eyes of his countrymen and of the
world, into the colossal figure whom the
nation mourned at his death, the equal,
it would seem, of the almost mythical
heroes of the past, an Alexander,
a Caesar, a Napoleon, all these
with an extra touch of humanity thrown
in; in Isaiah Berlin’s words, “a mythical
hero who belongs as much to legend as
to reality”?
It is sad to think that for some time
to come we are not likely to have a study
of Churchill which will prefer the reality
to the legend. But if it were to be written,
perhaps its author would notice, as afford-
ing some explanation both of Churchill’s
failure and his triumph, that one of
Churchill's most absorbing interests, per-
haps, indeed, the most absorbing interest
of his life, was one which to most of his
contemporaries was profoundly distaste-
ful and repugnant, that is to say, war.
It was one which had been with him
from his earliest youth, when he had
looked so. avidly for some frischer und
frohlicher krieg to which he could
attach himself. It was deepened by the.
for him, exhilarating experience of the
First World War and by his historical
studies of the life of Marlborough. When
the Second World War came, it was for
him, as he himself confesses, a relief and
a liberation, not only because the great
dangers which he had apprehended for
so long were now obvious to all but be-
cause he felt, rightly, that he was the
man, perhaps the only man, who was
fully equipped, mentally, morally, psy-
chologically, to face and overcome the
appalling problems which war creates.
It would not be unfair to Churchill to
say that, both on national and personal
grounds, he welcomed the war. He could
have said with some truth that it was
both the country’s and his own last
chance. This is not to say that Churchill
was ever blind or insensitive to the
misery, suffering, and cruelty of war, or
that the policies he advocated were in-
tended to provoke war rather than to
preserve peace, or that, war having come,
he ever wished to wage it for its own
sake. But he would have found it per-
fectly natural to say, with Robert E. Lee,
that it is a good thing we know how
terrible war is, or we should grow too
fond of it. And also he believed in war
as a perfectly legitimate weapon of
national policy, which should be kept in
reserve for the last emergency but never-
theless should be always brightly fur-
bished and ready for use. And he be-

lieved that, bad as war is, there are other
things which are worse.
Moreover war was not, for all its hor-
rors, something which filled him person-
ally with dismay and despair. He was like
an athlete who had trained all his life for
some supreme contest and when at last
it came he rejoiced in the opportunity to
show, to himself and to others, how well
equipped he was to meet it, how ready
for all its contingencies, even its disasters.
If it had not come he would have been
disappointed, like some championship
contender who has been cheated of a
title fight. If there was one particular
gift he gave his countrymen in 1940,
and which no one else could have given,
it was to inspire them with something of
his own exhilaration that at last a
moment had come which would demand
of them everything they had. Lincoln
spent half the Civil War looking for a
general who would fight and enjoyed
fighting. Even among generals such men
are rare. In Churchill, in 1940, Britain
found such a man.
And, as such men do, he succeeded,
for a time, in conveying to his country-
men the extraordinary sensation of actu-
ally enjoying “blood, sweat and tears”,
of facing total defeat and all the suffer-
ings and sacrifices that were necessary to
overcome it. This is not, of course, a
sensation which men often enjoy, or for
long. They go to war like Siegfried Sas-
soon’s soldiers:
Most went glumly through it
Dumbly doomed to rue it.
In this sense, Churchill was abnormal.
Though he saw and felt as deeply as any-
one the terrible issues, the waste, suffer-
ing, and destruction involved in war, he
also saw it, as Peter Pan saw life, as “aa
awfully big adventure”. Churchill him-
self was aware of his abnormality and of
how much it isolated him from others.
Lady Violet Bonham-Carter quotes him
as confessing, with a certain feeling of
guilt, during the First World War, that
though for others the war meant univer-
sal suffering, he could not help admitting
that he was enjoying himself intensely.
To say this of Churchill now is un-
fashionable, because in this generation
war has become a dirty word, and to say
of anyone that he enjoys it is rather
like accusing him of being a psychopath.
But it is significant that from the begin-
nings of his political career this is pre-
cisely what people tended to feel about
Churchill. It alarmed and bewildered
them, it made them feel that he was a
man who might lead them into irrespon-
sible adventures, it was the basis of the
mistrust which he almost universally in-
spired. In popular speech, in the Press,
this feeling was often expressed by call-
ing Churchill a war-monger. This was
unjust, he cared for peace as much as
any man, but he believed that peace
could be preserved and, if necessary,
restored by force of arms, and this read-
ing of history had no terrors for him.
Popular feeling was given a more
sophisticated expression in 1929 by John
Maynard Keynes, reviewing the fourth
volume of the world crisis. “With what
kind of feelings does one lay down Mr
Churchill’s two thousand pages? . . . ad-
miration for his energies of mind and
his intense absorption of intellectual in-
terest and elemental emotion in what is
for the moment the matter in hand
which is his best quality. A little envy,
perhaps, for his undoubting conviction
that frontiers, races, patriotism, even
war, if need be, are ultimate realities for
mankind, which lends for him a kind of
dignity and even nobility to events which
for others are only a nightmare interlude,
something to be permanently avoided.”

thing to be permanently avoided . . .”
Either in 1929, or now, there are pro-
bably few people who would disagree
with Keynes’ description of war as a
phenomenon of the 20th century. In such
a view war belongs to a past in which
life was anyhow nasty, brutish, and short,
and, in our own more advanced civilisa-
tion, cannot be taken seriously except as
a brutal and momentary invasion of the
condition of peace which is the norm
of civilised life. With war they would
classify other irrational factors like fron-
tiers, races, patriotism, all part of the
same nightmare, “something to be per-
manently avoided”,
As a hope and an aspiration, such a
view has every attraction. As a statement
of fact, it is extravagantly wide of the
mark. It dismisses war as violent, irra-
tional, degrading to the human being,
something which really has no business
to belong to the history of our own time.
It also ignores the ugly fact that war has
shaped and determined the lives of men
and women in the twentieth century
more than any other historical phenome-
non. Indeed, one might reasonably say
that it was both the most important and
the most characteristic feature of the
age through which we have had to live.
Far from war being a “nightmare inter-
lude”, it is peace which has been a slow
convalescence between the fierce and re-
peated agonies of war, in which nations
have enjoyed the somewhat illusory com-
forts of soldiers returned to base to be
rehabilitated for the front line.
Such a view is of course intensely anti-
pathetic to the spirit of the age, there is
something inexpressibly faded and out
of date about it, it belongs to the world
of Gobineau and Carlyle and Nietzche
and Spengler and other prophets who
look rather tawdry today in their tattered
robes. Yet as a realistic view of what has
happened, and is happening, in the his-
tory of our time, it has more to com-
mend it than the liberal and progressive
optimism of someone' like Keynes. It
was Churchill’s merit as a politician,
which also gave him his claim to great-
ness as a statesman, precisely that from
youth upwards he instinctively under-
stood that war was the determining fac-
tor in the history of the twentieth cen-
tury and had the courage to face and
accept the consequences.
To say this so soon after his death
may be taken by many people as a slur
upon his memory, especially because his
panegyrists have already done so much
to falsify that memory out of all recog-
nition. For it would have been shocking
for the British public to be told, at the
moment of his death, that their grief
and mourning, the sombre beauty of his
funeral, were all for a man whose true
greatness lay in his unalterable convic-
tion that war, in our time, is indeed the
ultimate reality and that nothing had
happened in his lifetime to modify this
belief. Yet it is precisely this which gave
to Churchill that “dimension of depth
and a corresponding sense of tragic pos-
sibilities” to which Isaiah Berlin refers.
Yet even he dissembles some of the truth
of his own insight. He tells us, for in-
stance, that whereas more • typical poli-
ticians derive their inspiration from the
present or the future, Churchill derived
his from the past.
Somehow this may leave one with the
impression that Churchill’s view of war
was also a thing of the past, a romantic
nostalgia for vanished glories, an imagi-
native sympathy for “old, unhappy, for
off things and battles long ago”.
In fact, Churchill’s acceptance of war
as the ultimate reality of our time came
from a profound and tragic insight into
the present, in this he was more modern
than any of his contemporaries, and it is
this above all which distinguishes him
from all the other democractic statesmen
of his age.

SIR. —I refer to the Gavin Young ar-
ticle “The Cassius Clay of South-East
Asia” (8., Oct. 16). We are not surprised
to read this article of Mr Gavin Young.
Mr Young belongs to the group of people
who are the odd men out for the peoples
of Asia, Africa and Latin America. Why?
Because the ideals the peoples of Asia,
Africa and Latin America are fighting
for do not suit the necolim wishes of
those odd men out. Mr Young accused
President Sukarno of inconsistency, of
“betraying the ideals of the Bandung
principles and the principles of non-
alignment”. Since when, may I ask Mr
Gavin Young and his odd men out
friends, have the Bandung principles
become respectable in their eyes?
Is it not true that when the Bandung
Conference was held in 1955, these odd
men out ridiculed this very same con-
ference and labelled it as “another tea
party, out of which nothing important
or everlasting will come”? And is it not
true that, when the principle of non-
alignment came into being, those odd
men out (Mr Young and friends) regard-
ed it as immoral? Your attacks on Pre-
sident Sukarno clearly bear evidence that
you know nothing about Indonesia or
you do not know the real Indonesia. Be-
cause if Mr. Young knew Indonesia he
would realise that the more those odd
men out attack President Sukarno, the
more united the Indonesian people, will
be in their determination to «tanH h-hind
their President.
No, the Indonesian peopie cannot be
separated from their acknowledged and
revered Leader, Bung Karno, who has
united and led them towards indepen-
dence, given them the State Ideology and
self-respect. 1 think Mr Young’s article is
full of a bitter feeling or feeling of
frustration that President Sukarno is still
as he has always been the Leader
of the Indonesian Revolution, command-
ing the absolute loyalty of the Army.
And this does not suit the necolim’s in-
terests. The true answer to Mr Gavin
Young's article is simple. It is provided
by “The Indonesian Herald” of October
8, which said editorially: "Bung Karno
has a people who believe fully in his
wisdom and leadership, and the people
have Bung Karno, whose wishes and
greatness are derived from the wishes
of the people”.

Hip Prosthesis
SIR.—I was intensely interested in Mr
Gordon Chesterman’s informative article
(8., October 9 . Readers may be interest-
ed to learn of the attitude adopted by
the Medical Benefits Fund of Australia
Ltd. The view of the Fund is that such
new-fangled devices as Dr Moore’s hip
prosthesis fall generally under the
Fund’s classification of “Appliances” and
as such are excluded from Fund bene-
fits.
Presumably, the Fund evades liability
due to the fact that the Fund, in turn,
cannot obtain any reimbursement from
the Commonwealth and they must con-
serve the Fund’s funds. The Medical
Benefits Fund was not, apparently, so
concerned about protecting subscribers’
funds some short time ago when untold
thousands of pounds of subscribers’
funds were squandered during the
Fund’s public “debate” with the Hos-
pitals Contribution Fund of NSW. I
write with some feeling on the matter,
as a subscriber under the highest scale
of Medical Fund benefits; and as the
husband of a patient who is able to walk
reasonably well today thanks to Dr
Moore’s prosthesis and its application
by a very capable Sydney orthopaedic
surgeon.

M. H. Ellis and Dangerous
Dan
SIR. —Poor Mr Ellis! I’m sorry I wasn’t
able to nourish his faded memories of
Burketown and Borroloola in those
nostalgic years somewhere before World
War I. Time has moved on since then.
What I aimed at in my book on Aus-
tralian ghost towns (8., Oct. 15) was a
contemporary view of these many scat-
tered places, not a series of historical
studies. I should, of course, accept with
chastened respect my caning by the
eminent headmaster of the M. H. Ellis
Correctional School for Australian Histor-
ians, but I just wonder whether he hap-
pened to read the book? Too bad about
Dangerous Dan. I should have given him
a spin. But how does he rate in the scale
of national biography wherein I was
obliged to deal though Mr E. doesn’t
mention it with Charles Rasp, Har-
graves, Leichhardt, Lawson, Captain
Stokes, J. V. Mulligan, Christie Palmer-
ston, Charles Hall and many others?
But what about Dangerous?
Normally I don’t comment on the
opinions of reviewers, who are quite
entitled to say they don’t like a book.
But they are also entitled to give the
reader a reasonable account of what it
contains. It is not so much a matter of
ethics as common sense to discuss what
is in before sounding off about what is
not in, even if this requires more than
what mining men call the grab-sampling
of a chapter or two. Mr E. appears to
have looked only at two of them, and
even so has missed the pages where I
discussed the origins of Burketown and
Borroloola, including the overlanders,
teamsters and the O.T. line he says I
ignored.
I can only assume it was some tempor-
ary attack of spleen, from which I
hope the good Mr Ellis is recovered,
that persuaded him that a bookful of
hard-sought information could be
gathered in “an hour or two in the local
hostelry with likely looking Munchau-
sens (sic)”. Where are these quaint
“hostelries” in Port Essington, Inna-
mincka, Old Tallangatta, Karumba, Pipe-
clay or Waukaringa? I would at least
have expected so empiric a reviewer to
send me to perdition for my views on
Chinese labor in the North, the impact
of convictism in southern Tasmania, the
trade relations between Indonesians and
Arnhem Land Aborigines, the efforts to
create a Singapore in the Northern Ter-
ritory, the ebb and flow of a dozen min-
ing fields and the rise of the BHP.
Perhaps he missed them all. There
are several methods of literary criticism,
and the last of them is to make a show
of possessing more arcane knowledge
than the contemptible writer. But what
about Dangerous Dan? When the sple-
netic critic runs as he reads, the author
can only read and run.

A Close-up of “The Mob”
By CHARLES HIGHAM and BEVERLEY TIVEY
Tt is shortly before 10 o’clock outside
the Adams Hotel in Pitt Street,
Sydney. The second sequence of
“They’re a Weird Mob” is being shot:
the first, in which Nine Culotta runs out
in the rain in search of a date, had been
photographed during a fortuitous rain-
storm on the previous Monday.
Walter as Nino, in a khaki
suit and straw hat with blue band, is
walking past the hotel; he sees it and
goes into the bar. Michael Powell, the
director, rehearses the scene minutely,
precisely checking the timing of a
woman in pink who has to cross the
pavement and go into the hotel lobby
at the same time Nino notices the pub.
After several rehearsals the shot is
at last ready for the first take. Once it
is over, everyone rushes into the bizarre
fin-de-siecle Marble Bar to prepare the
next. This is very complicated: the
camera operator has to carry the camera
through the crowd all along the bar to
the end, a subjective camera sequence
showing Nino’s first discovery of
Australian booze. The shot takes no
less than three hours to set up and
execute. As we leave for lunch at one
it is still being worked out.
Returning at three, we find that part
of the bar has been shielded off. A
rather difficult scene is being prepared,
The crowd is tense, many are drunk, and
the heat is fierce from the arcs as Nino
prepares to drink his first schooner. Jack
Allen, as a massively jovial bystander,
is to introduce Nino to Australian beer-
drinking habits. Anne Haddy as the bar-
maid, slim, tense and blonde, has to
hand over the drinks at a precise
moment in the dialogue between the
two men. There is a long rehearsal, but
she can’t get the drinks on to the counter
to coincide with Nino’s proper dialogue.
The extras have been drinking since
9 a.m., and look it. The first assistant
director, Claude Watson, irritably tells
the crowd to keep quiet.
Another rehearsal, another fluff.
Powell says with controlled irritation:
“Look, Anne darling, don’t worry about
the beer, just listen to the dialogue.”
But she still can’t get it right. Now she’s
getting nervous; the assistant director
calls out to her to relax. A last-minute
conference; Powell to Jack Allen: “You
can take it a little faster, Jack. Nino’s
hesitant enough; you can really rush it
through.”
Allen nods. Now Powell takes them
right through the whole take again;
another rehearsal and another take. But
the beer’s arrival is once more mis-
timed and Powell calls “cut”. The shot
has to be done again. More combing
of Anne Haddy’s hair; then, at long last,
a perfect take.
Powell smiles, relaxes and congratu-
lates everyone concerned, but the work
isn’t over. There are still two more
shots to do. Everyone looks hot and
flustered. And there are nine weeks to
go . . . Watching Michael Powell work,
it’s easy to see the extraordinarily!
patient, detailed work of the mastei
craftsman, using minutely directed re-i
hearsals and the minimum of “takes”
A series of encounters with the film’s!
stars indicates that Walter
relaxed and experienced playing is going
to be expertly balanced against the less 1
well - known chief male supporting
player, Ed Devereaux, and the almost
unknown girl chosen as the star, Clare
Dunne.
★ ★ ★
Walter Chiari is a wiry, dark man
whose name has always tended to hover
in the shadow of reputations like Mas-
troianni’s or Alberto Sordi’s. He had first
been shown “They're a Weird Mob” by
Michael Powell in 1960, and had felt
immediately drawn to the character.
Since then he had appeared, most'
notably, in a new feature directed by the;
veteran Alessandro Blasetti, “Me and
the Others”, with Gina Lollobrigida and
Marcello Mastroianni, in the leading rok
of a journalist who sets out to explort
the nature of egotism and discovers in the!
Tanner


end that he is the best living illustration
of the vice.
Chiari’s comments on the most cur-
rently fashionable Italian directors were
acute. Fellini’s new “Julietta of the
Spirits” was, he said, “an album of
Fauve paintings”, and Fellini a compiler
of images, a painter rather than a man
of cinema. Antonioni, he said, always
made the same picture, and his style
was somewhat sterile. “He is like a
man who confesses, and doesn’t care if
the priest understands.” It was interest-
ing to hear that these views were not
uncommon in Italy, and that the two
directors were much better thought of
outside their native country.
The part of Nino was, he said, not
easy to play. “It is apparently a delicate
and weightless part. It is about a man,
a simple man, who has to learn to tread
new ground step by step. Gradually
things happen. His character unfolds.
It is his reaction to events which shapes
him. He has no past, it is as though
he were born as soon as he set foot in
his new land. This is interesting. Here
you have to create a personality from
the ground up.”
★ * ★
One look at Clare Dunne and it’s not
hard to see why Michael Powell chose
her for the leading role of Kay, Nino’s
girl-friend in the film. A genuine
charmer, she possesses the sort of good
looks and grace that Powell admired in
Deborah Kerr and Moira Shearer, two
of his discoveries for films. Clare
Dunne is such a fine example of the type
that Michael Powell was apparently
ready to overlook the slight, pretty but
ineradicable Irish accent which, she had
assumed, would automatically put her
out of the running for the role.
Clare Dunne, who has worked as
Qantas air hostess, model and Channel 7
weather girl, said: “I’d never done much
real acting, except for compering, a tiny
role in ‘Jonah’, a lead in ‘Consider Your
Verdict’ and a part in ‘The Women’ at
the Independent. Of course, I’d been in
‘Beauty And The Beast’ and done mil-
lions of television commercials, as well
as a few small private ‘interlude’ TV
films. But when Mr Powell asked me,
‘What have you really done?’ all I could
say was ‘Nothing!’ ”
★ ★ ★
“Except when I’m working, I don’t
particularly want to seem like an actor,”
says Ed Devereaux, who plays Joe, the
head of the building crew, in the “Mob”.
“If I'm asked what I do for a living, I
feel inclined to tell people I work in a
pickle factory. This ‘Weird Mob’ role
makes only about the sixth visual Aus-
tralian I’ve played. In England I mostly
played Americans, Liverpudlians and
Cockneys.”
Devereaux, who recently had the lead
in “My Brother Jack” on television,
began his acting career in 1944 when
he appeared for JCW’s in Gladys Mon-
crieff musicals and later in drama, as
well as working backstage on lighting.
In 1950 he decided to try his luck in
England “where I fell flat on my face”.
For most of his first year he worked as
an all-night cab driver (“I had more
fights than hot dinners”) and drove a
truck. During this time he tended to
avoid his Australian show business
acquaintances.
Finally, Devereaux auditioned for the
leading baritone role in a Festival tour
of “Lilac Time” and, “by a miracle”,
got the job. After this his career worries
were over. He played in variety —he
appeared in a Royal Command variety
performance—compered and sang in a
BBC radio series, played in “Guys And
Dolls” at the London Coliseum for
three years, starting in a supporting role
and taking over the lead. He worked
in TV drama (including the lead in a
BBC presentation of “The Harp in the
South”, produced by Australian Alan
Burke), and has appeared in over 30
feature films, “some quite long parts,
some just cameos”, including Nicholas
Ray’s “The Savage Innocents”.
At the moment his attention is taken
up with the “Weird Mob” role. “Being
an actor gives me a big kick when I
start a new job I’m like a little boy at
Christmas.” But his long-range plan is
to use London as his base. “Acting here
is a vocation, but in England it’s just
another job, and I like that,” he says in
conclusion.

By DAVID MARTIN and TERRY STAPLETON
At The Union Theatre, Melbourne:
Between the low farce that has lately
monopolised our large playhouses,
and the Festival of alienation at the
Union, we are beginning to feel like
hysteriacs swinging from wild elation to
bleakest despair. Oh where, oh where
has the middle ground gone—the whole
broad theatre of conflict and experience?
Up the suburban spout, I guess.
t ~ , ,
When reviewing the book of Osborne s
(ST , • , r? -j „
Inadmissible Evidence (Bulletin,
August 28) thought it damnably
depressing but with a touch of great-
ness. Now I am not so sure. It remains,

m a minor, cameo fashion, some pretty
powerful characterisation to accompany
the central lour de force.
But it is too long, and not only in
point of time. It also drags emotionally.
Maybe we have simply seen too much of
self-torture and long for relief well
before Bill at last lets go the telephone,
the cord of which is the umbilical one
that so mercilessly yet tenuously ties
him to the uterus of his unhappy world.
Maitland is real, his wife—whom we
never see—is real. So are his managing
clerk, the subordinate Jones and Mait-
land’s daughter, a teenager who walks
into his office, listens and goes out ten
minutes later without having opened her
mouth. They are as real as the two sec-
retaries, 006 as anc *

land, and Barbara Angel and Joy Mit-
chell contribute fair talent to the cast,
John Sumner’s production convinces
me that the opening scene, in which
Maitland mocks himself up as defendant
in an imaginary dock, is essential after
all. It is brilliantly mounted. He ap-
proaches the story with realism in mind,
not as a grim parable. A very good, un-
fussy set supports his timing. To choose
the right actor for Maitland’s part must
have been a problem. Edward Hepple
gives a driving, well-sustained perform-
ance, but in my view it is too restless
and his Maitland seeks too much sym-
pathy from the audience he is too
light, even too comic, on his own sub-
limated villainy. The bravura of his
speed-up dissolution should not hide
his responsibility, nor the weight of his
years.
At the Teachers’ College Theatre, Adelaide: i
Tohn Tasker’s Adelaide production is
excellent. From the first scene—the
misty, never-never land of a self-trial
(hampered only by some Martian music),
to the final curtain when Maitland,
pathetically isolated by lighting and
mood, sits in an ultimate despair of
guilt, fatigue and rejection Tasker’s
direction sustains compellingly this
relentless but abortive exorcism. The
devils are all brought out but never
banished.
But in a play of this length and con-
tent there are inevitably problems of
pace and Tasker hasn't solved them
all. Parts of Act II seemed to need cut-
ting or tightening.
Bill Maitland, a role of numbing size
and complexity, obviously demanded a
seasoned actor who had warmed up in
straightforward romps like Hamlet, Lear
and After the Fall. David Turnbull
hasn't these qualifications, but his per-
formance seldom betrays the fact. His
appearance is totally convincing: tall 1
but cowering; with good looks which
have almost survived dissipation. Turn-j
bull looks and plays like a man whose
massive excesses have produced sordid
problems with digestion, waist-line and!
potency.
His mannerisms, too, are effective:!
the chronic throat-clearing, the inter-,
minable pocket-patting in a desperate
quest for another pill or cigarette, the ,
restlessness. His stage movement is less |
successful, though during his frequent
outbursts he sometimes stalks about with
a peculiar, stiff-legged, staccato gait,
looking for all the world like a man
testing his first pair of artificial legs, j
Dennis Olsen contributes a careful,
clever study of a homosexual, and Gor-
don McDougail (looking like a one-man
Gordon Chater) is appropriately brash, k
thoughtless and superficial as Maitland’s
colleague.
Betty Lucas rips off three fastidious,
quite brilliant sketches as the clients and
makes it all look easy.

NOW
IS THE TIME
TO DEINK AUSTRALIAN WHISKY
TELEVISION
Tattered Fringes
Living on the Fringe. Channel 2, Sydney.
Beyond the Fringe. Channel 7, Sydney.
rr»ELEVisiON provided us with an exercise
*• in tangled semantics recently, al-
though it was one with fringe benefits.
First, ABC Television showed its 1965
Prix Italia entry, a half-hearted examina-
tion of life in some of Sydney’s inner
suburbs, the “fringe” being social rather
than geographical. Later in the week
Channel 7, in a hysteria of programme
changes, showed a BBC filming of the
London revue whose “fringe” was the
lunatic one of contemporary society,
and which presumably the ABC had
passed over as too much for its weak
stomach.
“Living on the Fringe” contained so
much good camera work and so often
came close to what one would presume
a documentary about slum life would
attempt to show, the vital facts, that it
was a shame to see it hesitate, pull
away from them, and photograph the
mundane and the banal instead. Its
director, Gian-Carlo Manara, went to
great trouble in getting children from
the slum area schools to write and record
their feelings, and in recording one or
two adult residents’ spoken thoughts.
He used a hand camera, a camera in
moving vehicles, and cameras in night
scenes, all most effectively. But he saw
too little and evaded too much.
The slums of inner Sydney are cer-
tainly unsavory, but not en bloc. The
streets shown in “Living on the Fringe’’
are terrible, but a few streets away similar
houses stand, repainted and renovated.
These were not shown, nor the spirit of
their owners mentioned. The children
of the Aboriginal, middle and brand new
Australians were shown in the streets,
and in one instance inside a home, but
often the streets are havens and the
homes are the true hell, and this was
not even suggested. Colossal rents were
mentioned, but no questions asked.
So “Living on the Fringe” ended as
, a bubbling mishmash accompanied by a
soggy commentary delivered by its pro-
) ducer, Alan Ashbolt. In no way did it
help me to discover what the alleged
documentary was supposed to be about.
I shudder to think of the mental con-
fusion it will cause among the Prix Italia
judges.
The British “Fringe” was a murderous
attack, without evasion, on many kinds
of people and institutions, not so much
beyond the fringe as right on it. There
was the clergyman droning through some
marvellously disconnected texts, thoughts
and fantasies in the course of a sermon.
A deadly dull literary type gave an “I
knew T. E. Lawrence when” lecture.
Four “city” types approached a club bar
and dining-room with all the traditional
idiot noises and gestures of knotheads
out on the town. In a television inter-
view a Minister twiddled his thumbs to
show how the atom worked, adding,
“And this is what our scientists are doing,
you see.” An African statesman proved
that black was white. Some twittery men
dressed, faced the camera, and sang a
commercial jingle about “a man’s
cigarette”. It was nearly all deadly fun.
This “Fringe” was written and per-
formed by four young men. It showed
what British satire is, and that any
relationship to the local product is purely
in the minds of some deluded people.
DALE MILLER
FILMS
Rope of Sand
The Hill. Director, Sidney Lumet. Liberty
Theatre, Sydney.
That Man from Rio. Director, Philippe de
Broca. Town Theatre, Sydney.
An angry, indignant film, “The Hill”
is often shockingly effective, though
it doesn’t always avoid spilling over into
hysteria. The harsh and totally mean-
ingless discipline of the Army defaulters’
camp is presented as the logical extension
of the traditional Army mystique.
The hill itself sums up the whole argu-
ment of the film a man-made hill of
sand and rubble, serving no purpose
except to inflict punishment on the men
who must toil over it in the African sun,
carting sand uselessly from one side to
the other. Sidney Lumet makes brilliant
visual use of the absurd, horrifying sand-
dune; even when the action doesn’t take
place on the hill, the cameras are placed
on top of it, or peer round its shoulder,
so that it dominates the screen just as it
can never be far from the minds of its
victims or their warders.
The camp is run by an old-style RSM
who genuinely believes that harsh
punishment will make men out of de-
faulters. The arrival of a new batch of
prisoners coincides with that of a new
warder a genuine, uncomplicated
sadist whose only aim is to destroy the
men he regards as inferior. The sub-
sequent clash demonstrates that brutality
can only brutalise both its victims and
its practitioners, an obvious point, but
one that can’t be too often stated.
Lumet is at his best in films within a
small compass, probably because of his
television background, and he expertly
handles his players in the claustrophobic
atmosphere of the prison camp. He is
fortunate in a fine cast; Sean Connery,
a lifetime away from the sleek inanities
of the James Bond films, reminds us that
he’s one of today’s most forceful and
unselfish actors; Harry Andrews and
Michael Redgrave give impeccable per-
formances. The film’s soundtrack is
worthy of note; there is no musical
score, just the background of the
natural sounds of shouted commands,
the ragged breathing of exhaustion, the
droning of flies.
Philippe de Broca’s comedy-thriller
“That Man from Rio” has been called a
parody of Bond films, but its flavor is
more that of the old-fashioned cliff-
hanger, and owes, too, a good deal to
Hitchcock in his more skittish moods.
Deliciously photographed in color, dis-
armingly improbable in plotting, the film
has an engaging levity. What it sounds
like we'll never know, for this is
a dubbed version. Dubbing is a villainous
practice at any time and here unfor-
givable: Jean-Paul Belmondo is afflicted
with a growling, pseudo-American voice,
while Francoise Dorleac burbles like
something out of a cartoon. The neatly-
managed sight gags and the imaginative
photography give some light impression
of what a droll, free-wheeling comedy
this must originally have been.

corrupt.”
Of course that’s not unironic, not
totally. But there is the tension in the
Chandler stories between the wealth
and ease and glamor of the film-star
world, and the squalor of the crime
world the sets of rickety offices, tired
drugstores, rundown hotels. Chandler’s
first story, “Blackmailers Don’t Shoot”,
which appeared in “Black Mask” maga-
zine in 1933, involves the blackmailing
of a movie star, Rhonda Farr. “Finger
Man” involves not a film figure but a
politico; the setting, though, is still the
gambling world of the wealthy. A lot of
our pleasure comes from the portrayal
of the “sophisticated” world a por-
trayal that shows to our satisfaction the
foundations of vice and crime on which
it is built. It’s an outsider’s satisfaction,
of course both a vicarious dwelling
on la dolce vita and a comforting sense
of seeing the mighty wicked fall.
The Chandler heroes are outsiders
too; they aren’t socially acceptable, they
are supported by no Establishment or
organisation, they’ve none of Bond’s
knowledge of food and wine. Marlowe
drives a battered, out-of-date and hard-
to-start convertible in “Finger Man”.
Carmady, the private investigator in
“Goldfish”, is told of his clothes, “Gosh,
that blue serge shines. You must have
money in the bank, the clothes you
wear.” And the only thing they seem to
know how to drink is whisky.
The way women are treated fits in
with this pattern. Marlowe
always seems to be kicking
them out of his bed. This
isn’t, as some commentators
have suggested, moral op-
posed to Spillane’s amorality.
It’s a sort of moralistic touch,
but its appeal comes, surely,
from the feeling that it would
be good to be tough enough
to do that, to be able to resist
the obvious allures that trap
lesser men. There’s a sort of
masochism in it, too, the hero
denying himself what he’d
rather like, just as the beatings
up are so necessary to the
stories. Marlowe is beaten up which
suggests that he’s not so clever that we
can’t identify with him; and somehow
also is fitting as if he deserves the
beatings up.
The psychoanalyst Charles Rycroft
has dealt with a theory by Geraldine
Pederson-Krag that detective stories de-
rive their interest from a reactivation of
the primal scene. According to her, the
murder is a symbolic representation of
RAYMOND CHANDLER
parental intercourse, and the victim is
the parent for whom the child had neg-
ative oedipal feelings. Rycroft argues
that from this hypothesis the reader
must identify not only with the detective
(the child’s infantile curiosity) but also
with the criminal (the child’s hostility
towards the parent). And Rycroft argues
that few detective stories achieve the
status of art as this identification of the
reader with the criminal is denied. But
with Chandler the detective (with whom
we identify) often is nearly criminal;
certainly he’s in opposition to the police,
and often to the people who employ
him.
Mallory, in “Blackmailers Don’t
Shoot”, sorts out the crime but
is acting against police,, against
the crook who hired him, and
against the film star whom he’s
helping. And he suffers for
his work. In “Nevada Gas”
the central figure is a gambler
who is only doubtfully more
honest and less a mobster than
the crooks he’s dealing with.
And one of the reasons for
the failure of “The King in
Yellow” is that the hero-in-
vestigator is too obviously
moral, leaves his job after
being falsely maligned, and
acts like a goody throughout.
He even indicts the baddies at the end
“You're just a couple of cheap hood-
lums after all. A couple of nasty-minded
sadists playing at being avengers of
wronged girlhood.”
But within this psychological pattern,
even if we accept it, there is room for
a range of different literary qualities.
And “The Smell of Fear” allows us to
see how far Chandler progressed from
that first story, in book form here for
the first time, to his peak, and on to the
last story he wrote. The first story has
all the stock Chandler qualities fast-
moving action, keen characterisation
but it has, too, the pulp writer’s cliches.
“His rigid hand shot up like a strik-
ing snake.” "A sharp light of wonder
winked into being deep in Mallory’s
brain.” Chandler cut away this sort of
writing later and became the great
master of taut prose. The weaknesses in
the last story he wrote, “The Pencil”
(which deals with Mafia killings), are
of a different order. The tough gestures
have become a little tired and there’s a
certain querulousness about “this beat-
nik generation when you can't get
through a meal without some male or
female stomach singer belching out a
kind of love . . .”
More noticeable is the double stand-
ard morality that always lurked in the
background but here is explicit. Mar-
lowe says to Anne Riordan: “I’ve had
too many women to deserve one like
The Cherry Tree
(For John Weir)
Uphill, uphill, beyond the
sluiceboxes, pipes and sacking,
roots of old man broom had kneed
apart so high above the
gully, one hose-nozzle could
have sent the whole cliff tumbling,
about noon, when sheep skulls were
alive with cicadas, I
came to that uncertain tree
of wild black cherries. Under
the rock crest, bare to the sky,
grass-overgrown, and like the
clods of ruined Carthage thrown
into time’s gulf, lay sod walls
built by an Irishman what
had been a croft. The sluice-blown
chasm gashed the old path that
led once by hives and kennels
to a hill orchard. Only
that one tree was left. Half a
mile in air, above the cliff,
the dams, the broken ground, the
wide island, as if brought safe
on a hawk’s back, high up there
I tasted bitter cherries
at noon, poised alone among
crooked branches. Did I then
catch in the drunken abyss
wind-shaken, the cry of one
bird or spirit with no nesting
place between dark sky and burst
acres of rummaged clay? If
so, I should have made the sign
of the cross on forehead, breast
and shoulders, to divide then
the dead grief from the live grief.

on that first English crime story “The
Moonstone”, indicated how closely con-
nected the oedipal conflicts of the de-
tective story, and the double standard,
are. Normally, though, Chandler was in
much greater control of his material.
The psychological stresses were concea-
led, sublimated in the form itself.
And the result was those brilliant
stories that do have a literary value

T have a sneaking regret that there is
nothing in “The Time of the Pea-
cock” to criticise: it would make my job
so much easier. But this is more than
just reviewers’ honesty; it defines “The
Time of the Peacock”. A book like this
is not meant for reviewers —or for
modern reviewing at all—any more than
are the tales still told in the market
places of Asia. But such are the demands
of the publishing system (and literary
editors) one must proceed as if it were.
I would much prefer to remain open-
mouthed and wide-eyed, or perhaps just
happily tearful, like the audiences I have
seen in those market places. Do I make
it plain, then, that for me “The Time of
the Peacock” is a small miracle?
In an increasingly sophisticated age,
in a fairly sophisticated society, Mena
Abdullah and Ray Mathew have not set
out to produce a Great Book, an Im-
portant Book, a Relevant Book, or even
a Contribution to Australian Literature.
They have simply sat down (I rather see
them squatting) and told a round dozen
tales as if modern literature had never
happened; and at times they almost
make one wish it hadn't. They have
nothing to tell except their stories, and
the stories are everything.
So far as I know, this is the first re-
port in fiction (though it is far from a
report and one wonders just how much
it is fiction) from the Asian minority
in either of the predominantly Anglo-
Saxon countries of Australia and New
Zealand. But the authors do not nag
us about the condition of Australian
society, the situation of the Asian immi-
grant. Australian society a farmer
from over the hill, children in a nearby
town impinges very slightly on the
Indian family almost all the stories con-
cern. There is just Australia —-the strange
land itself —and an Indian family, on
the land, bound together by love. This
intense love, implicitly a response to
exile, is everything; the word outcrops al-
most only in the first lines of the book
(“When I was little everything was won-
derful; the world was our farm and
we were all loved ... we loved one
another and everything turned to good”)
and thereafter has a subterranean exist-
ence, pervading everything and explain-
ing much. Society has a particularly re-
mote existence, beyond the frontiers of
this love. The world of farm and family
means more than just joy and tears, but
content and absolute fulfilment.
The underlying values of the book
would alone make it unique; but the
values are in fact inseparable from the
form. Each piece is simple and direct
in language and construction. What-
ever the poet Ray Mathew's contribu-
tion may have been (and one would
like to know, if only to apportion the
applause) there is nothing self-con-
sciously or artfully artless about the
stories. In work like this, where so much
tired language is given back its full
value, the danger is that one ill-chosen
word can throw a whole story out of
gear; something like walking a tight-
rope across a mined field. (Other writ-
ers can afford any number of ill-chosen
words and get away with it.) It is a
tribute to the authors that this never
happens. There is nothing slight about
any of the stories and they are stories
rather than sketches, though their length
may indicate otherwise; they develop,
people change and learn, and a point is
nailed swiftly and precisely. This is the
craft of fiction at its most elementary;
and, since literature lost confidence in
itself, at its most difficult. How much, I
wonder, did Ray Mathew have to un-
learn?
This journal’s readers will be familiar
with most of the stories already, since
all but two first appeared in these pages,
but I hope this does not deter anyone
from approaching the book; at least part
of its impressive effect is cumulative
in catching the rhythms of family life,
of growing up, of life on the land. Aus-
RAY MATHEW
tralia emerges in curious and fascinating
double-focus: an eagle-hawk becomes
“the High Maharajah”, ruler of the sky;
the bushranger Thunderbolt intertwines
with the Indian outlaw Malik Khan in
the mind of the young girl narrator. My
one real regret is that the children of
the family are not pursued into adult
life —the final story of the collection
leaps to India, where an old peasant
woman is knitting a jumper for her
student son in Australia (in some ways
the most moving story of all, though it
does not belong here) but it is obvious
that the simplicity of the form would
just not be adequate to contain the com-
plex experience of an Indian adolescent
or young adult in Australian society.
The method is of a piece with the
material and determines the material; but
what the authors achieve within the
limitations of the method is remarkable.
My final note can be personal. In
the countryside of my childhood I can
remember several seemingly lonely Asian
families —always at a distance apparently
as much of their own choosing as that
of the Maori or European New
Zealanders around. Mena Abdullah and
Ray Mathew have made me see why,
made me understand their pride and
self-sufficiency. They could have thus
persuaded me, probably, in any number
of ways; but the way they have chosen
is a triumph. They have not really
written about an Indian family in Aus-
tralia at all —but about any family in
exile anywhere. They celebrate the
family, they celebrate love. And their
characters outgrow their tiny frames and
become as large and luminous as the
figures in Greek or Polynesian legends.
I don’t think I will find “The Time of
the Peacock” easy to forget, and I don’t
think—when they come to read it —that
my children will either. It is that kind
of book: to be passed on within a family,
with love.
While “The Time of the Peacock” Is

all categories and classes of readers (like,
say, “Huckleberry Finn”), Maria Wol-
kowsky's “Australian Adventure” is
specifically for children. A pair of
orphaned English children, brother and
sister, are brought out to Australia by
an outback farmer uncle. Much of the
material is therefore predictable. “Look,”
says the uncle, “here is the electric saw,
and may I present the crane on wheels,
the oxy-weld’ing outfit, the wool-press,
the lathe. I'll show you the hydraulic
sheep-bath in a moment . . . and we
also have two caterpillar tractors, a
dredge, and a bulldozer.” But most of
the information (flying doctor and all) is
got across more neatly. What really dis-
tinguishes the story, as a work for
youngsters, is Maria Wolkowsky’s treat-
ment of the Aboriginal theme, on which
the children’s experience of Australia
comes to hang; and which is crucial in
their decision to stay. She does not
patronise her young readers and simplify
the place of the Aborigine in 20th-
century Australia: the tragedy of a race
is there, with all its complexity, and be-
comes for the two children the mystery
at the heart of the country they have
chosen for home. All this lifts the book
above the run-of-the-mill yarn- it could
so easily have been.
Those Kennedys
By JOHN POWER
The Founding Father. The story of Joseph
P. Kennedy A Study in Power, Wealth
and Family Ambition. Richard J. Whalen.
Hutchinson. 70s.
T>ecause they are the most emancipated
peasants of modern times, the Irish
have been somewhat neglected by
students of politics in Australia and the
US. Such discussion as has occurred has
tended to concentrate rather narrowly
on the topic of Catholicism and has not
gone beyond this to explore the question
of whether there is a distinctively Irish
style of politics. All too often we seem
to assume that facility with the English
tongue is sufficient proof that the savage
from the peat bogs has become Angli-
cised, and therefore civilised.
Accordingly, a careful and well-
written study, such as Whalen’s, is valu-
able not only for the light that it throws
on the rise of the Kennedys but also
because it provides us with some in-
sights into the ideological and political
style of the migratory Irish.
As the present generation of Ken-
nedys continues to shine brightly in
the political firmament, it is interesting
to trace how they got there. Great-
grandfather Patrick (who left Ireland in
1848) did little more than get the family
to the launching pad. for he died shortly
after the birth of his only son, Patrick
Joseph. P.J., however, turned out to
be a sturdy first stage, becoming a
relatively prosperous saloon-keeper, and
political boss of East Boston, and thus
able to send his son, Joseph Patrick, to
Harvard. Given this start, Joe developed
into a powerful booster with prodigious
thrust, combining remarkable money-
making powers (his fortune is variously
estimated at between a quarter and a half
a billion dollars) with a part-time career
in public service, climaxed by his two
and a half years as Ambassador to the
Court of St James’ in the crucial years
1938 to 1940. Although he thus had
succeeded in propelling himself into
public orbit (there was even a “Ken-
nedy for President” boomlet in 1940),
Joe, with his anachronistic ideology,
was' not of a design suitable to the
achievement of national elective office.
However, another generation of Har-
vard (when added to the refinements
of a prep school like Choate) succeeded
in producing a group of Kennedys de-
signed for functioning at the highest
levels.
Now this was not just a matter of
social acceptability and status, although
it was a great help to Jack to be, as
Governor Dever of Massachusetts once
put it, “the first Irish Brahmin”. In
addition, and probably more impor-
tantly, it entailed thorough-going changes
in ideological perspective. In comparison
to his sons, Joe Kennedy remained very
much the Irish peasant in his outlook.
Indeed, his public image seems to be
a classic case of the “authoritarian per-
sonality” for he is widely believed
to have been anti-Semitic as well as
ethnocentric, pro-fascist as well as anti-
British. However, it is one of the virtues
of Whalen's book to have shown that
things are a good deal more complicated
than they might seem to be at the level
of popular myths and stereotypes.
For example, although Joe developed
a remarkably strong orientation towards
his immediate family (natural enough in
an Irishman, and especially so in one
who was the only surviving son of an
only son), it is hard to characterise him
as ethnocentric. In this regard his atti-
tude to the Jews is particularly in-
strpetive: “Anti-Semitism is their fight
just as anti-Irishism was my fight
and the fight of my fathers in this
country.” Thus Kennedy was not so
much hostile as indifferent to out-
groups they had to fight for their

own welfare, for this was the American
Way. For similar reasons he tended to
be isolationist in the late ’thirties for
be did not believe that the United States
should be drawn into European quar-
rels. At the same time his sympathies
were clearly with the British and against
the Nazis (although his pessimistic
prognoses throughout the period were
consistently against the British and in
favor of the Nazis), if for no other
reason than the fact that as the American
Ambassador in London he found himself
taking to the British Establishment, and
especially to Neville Chamberlain, with
whom he developed a close friendship.
Unlikely as this association with Cham-
berlain might seem, it was in fact a
manifestation of a characteristic behavior
pattern of Kennedy’s, which we may
term “personalised deference” to those
occupying positions of high authority,
such as Pius XII (who gave evidence
of his warm regard for the Kennedys
by naming only one Papal Countess
throughout his entire reign Joe’s wife
Rose) and F.D.R. (who well knew how
to manipulate this need of Joe’s to be
the friend of the great). In these cir-
cumstances it must have been sweet
satisfaction indeed for Kennedy to end
up the father of a father figure.
And yet the satisfaction was, of course,
short-lived, as Kennedy’s congenital
Irish pessimism might have led him to
expect. For all his financial successes
(which were themselves due in large
part to a prudent caution not uncon-
nected with pessimism), Joe Kennedy’s
supreme concerns have revolved around
his family and its status in the eyes of
posterity. As he himself once put it:
“For the Kennedys, it’s either the out-
house or the castle no in-between.”
Although he has now lost three of his
children through violent deaths, Joe
Kennedy may still nourish the hope that
another of his progeny may reach the
castle of the Presidency in the not too
distant future.
A Battling Irishman
By M. H. ELLIS
Australian Democrat. Bruce Mansfield.
Sydney University Press. 30s.
'T'dward William O’Sullivan, the
subject of Professor Mansfield's
essay in biography, began to take an
interest in public affairs when he was
five. Professor Mansfield tells us that
when the young man came to Sydney at
21 he relished the “raw vigor” of Syd-
ney politics of 1869 when that “com-
bative character” John Dunmore Lang
contended with fiery orators like John
Dailey. He listened to them all, includ-
ing Parkes and Robertson.
Any thirst O'Sullivan had for politics
had to be suppressed while he went back
to his old job as a compositor on the
Hobart “Mercury” until he and three
other partners put up £27 each to give
Hobart “The Tribune”, an evening paper
and a rival to the unpopular “Mercury”.
He promptly scooped the “Mercury” on
the verdict of the Tichborne case, which
he received by a £3 cable from Mel-
bourne and printed in the streets for
distribution on a “small press” on a dray.
After the inevitable demise which
comes to journals founded co-operatively
by the staff on the bases of high demo-
cratic ideals, a capital of £27 and a
large loan from the Bank of Hope, O’Sul-
livan transferred his career to mainland
Australia to establish an equally fate-
deserted “Evening Tribune” in Mel-
bourne. He then progressed to the editor-
ship of the “St Arnaud Mercury”, or-
namented the composing staffs of sev-
eral daily papers in Melbourne and
Sydney and founded (with Frank Cot-
ton) “The Democrat” in Sydney. He
was manager of John Norton’s “Truth”
at the time of the 1893 bank smash and
later editor of the “Freeman’s Journal’’.
He also became an alderman.
Later, O'Sullivan achieved the most
curious ministerial affiliations Mini-
ster for Public Works in the Cabinet of
that not-so-sterling democrat “Oom
Paul’’ Lyne, Minister for Lands under
Waddell and a seat even with the wily
Joe Carruthers. In his middle political
years O'Sullivan was, inter alia, the
father of the idea of removing Sydney's
Central Railway Station from its old
out-of-town site at Redfern to its
present location on top of an historic
cemetery. He was also at various times
an ardently reforming Lands Minister,
a trustee of Captain Cook’s landing
place -at Kurnell and a vociferous
Federalist who accompanied Sir Robert
Garran to the Corowa Conference at
which the Federalist programme took
shape.
Professor Mansfield sums him up, in
the words of the “Worker”, as a “bust-
ling, energetic, courageous political bat-
tler whose very blunders seemed to en-
dear him to the hearts of the people”; a
man, gifted with determination and the
rare gift of political imagination for
which B. R. Wise gave him credit. There
was nothing raffish about him as there
was about some other politicians in his
compartment of public affairs. He was
courteous by nature, and personally
likeable and amusing.
Professor Mansfield, though he “lays
it on rather thick” when he enumerates
his subject’s virtues and dwells on the
love and esteem in which he, supposedly,
was held by all and sundry, and is
hampered by a certain lack of know-
ledge of the inner political background
and personal currents of the time, has
written a competent piece of biography
in this book.


BUSINESS AND FINANCE
Single Brokerage Logic
A STRONGER tone in the share market and some active rights trading was mor©
encouraging for Australia’s stockbrokers last week. The heartier tone was
attributed to drought-relieving rains, Stock Exchange chairman Alistair Urquhart’s
prediction on market prospects, and Mr Staniforth Ricketson’s suggestion that current
opportunities would not last forever.
Talk around the town did not indicate
any undue optimism, because of soft
patches already appearing in the
economy and the tightness of money.
However, brokers were a little more
cheerful after a lean period of customer
drought.
We asked a couple of brokers what
they thought of the single brokerage
proposal for share traders who buy and
sell within three months. There has.
been marked opposition to this sugges-
tion within the Associated Stock Ex-
changes and there is a strong body of
broker opinion against it.
It seems that many brokers do not
believe they can gain much by attracting
speculators back into the market. Specu-
lators frequently are small fry, with in-
adequate funds. It was argued by one
broker last week that whatever he might
gain from speculators could be lost by
encouraging the existing “genuine in-
vestors” to sell within the three months
period of concession buying and selling.
This appears to be a contradiction,
since the genuine investor is a long-term
holder anyway and the type of stock in
which he is interested may not provide
much of a turn in three months unless
the market rises sharply.
Speculators may not provide as much
brokerage as the institutions. They do,
however, have a real place in the share
market, as has been proved overseas,
particularly in America. Besides, the
trend is for institutions to by-pass
brokers where convenient.
It is true that speculators and traders
provide more opportunities for a fluctu-
ating market. It is also true that people
can get their fingers burnt in such fluctu-
ations and become sour on investments
if they lose money.
There are certain types of speculators,
of course, who will always lose money,
whether it be on horse-races, poker
machines or some other form of
gambling, These people undoubtedly
have their place in society; if they can
be encouraged to channel their funds
into investments and become long-term
“good guys”, it would be beneficial for
both the market and themselves.
It is indisputable, therefore, that a
lot of money is being spent, gambled, or
wasted outside the share market which
could be channelled to better use. The
saving habit, or investment habit, brings
captive supporters to a market. Even
speculators sometimes become million-
aires with control of valuable funds.
Brokers have their statistics, no doubt,
to back up their claim that a single
brokerage for short-term trading is un-
profitable.
But the traders who are out of the
market, and who might be encouraged
to have a go at making a short-term
profit on shares, cannot see the logic
of it.
Preferential Treat men t
HPalking last week to an executive of
a US company which has been
spending large sums on expansion in
Australia, we asked what effect (if any)
was being felt from the US “voluntary”
restrictions on overseas capital invest-
ment.
It was a pertinent question, if only
because Australia’s balance-of-payments
figures continue to show that a strong
flow of overseas money is still coming
to Australia. Also it would be interest-
ing to know if Australia gets favorable
treatment as far as US capital is con-
cerned.
LORD CROMER
Governor of the Bank of England.
The answer: If you are sitting at the
helm of a big international company and
the economic conditions and political
climate remain favorable in an area like
Australia, you do not rock the boat.
You have control over your whole
operation in various parts of the world
and you probably may decide to restrain
operations in some other place where
you are not doing so well.
This could permit you to meet your
commitment to the US Government in
reducing your individual balance of pay-
ments by 15 p.c. However, it may suit
your purpose in some countries where
you have been successful to feed extra
funds into that country.
“This has happened in Australia. We
have not had any financial strain here
because expansion has been justified. I
know a number of companies that have
gone ahead on the same basis and Mr

r J]HE Chancellor of the Exchequer, Mr
Callaghan, and the Governor of the

notice in London last week that the
squeeze on the economy would certainly
rule for some time yet. Of the other per-
plexities nagging at Britain, the previous
week's relative optimism over Rhodesia
was seen to be rather premature. In
combination this pair of influences brought

for sterling and a feeling hat much of
the recovery programme will prove effec-
live, however, which allowed the markets
not to become unduly depressed. There's
still, also, a wide hope for the fairly
speedy lowering of Bank Rate.
Equities as a whole could hardly avoid
an impression of irregularity, yet a
reasonable firmness was apparent by the
end of the week. The general market
mood received assistance from some favor-
able company reports, permitting a few
leaders like Plessey, Fisons, Glaxo and

For This Relief ...
Tn Australia’s tricky and partly drought-
induced exports situation, America’s
removal of quota restrictions on lead
and zinc imports can certainly be greeted
with some relief. A bevy of domestic
producers the Barrier companies,
Mount Isa, EZ Industries should be
able to lift their earnings. More signifi-
cantly, the imperilled balance of pay-
ments must get a sizeable stimulus.
President Johnson’s move, terminating
an “escape clause” under the Trade Ex-
pansion Act (1962), has been made be-
fore the natural expiry of quota restric-
tions, covering lead and zinc, in October,
1967. He bluntly points to benefits for
the United States the action “will pre-
vent the loss of jobs in many sections of
the nation”.
Facing shortages of the two metals,
the President explained that “United
States companies which require unmanu-
factured lead and zinc in their processing
and manufacturing activities have made
clear their great need for additional lead
and zinc in fact, many have indicated
that without immediate relief they will
be forced to suspend operations”.
Australian producers most likely have
had some presentiment of the chances of
freer entry into the US market. Broken
Hill South’s recent annual report drew
attention to the United States’ Tariff
Commission’s recommendation for elim-
ination of the quotas.
The South report also suggested that,
so far as lead was concerned, world sup-
ply and demand were coming into “ap-
proximate balance”. Zinc has continued
to show supply deficiencies, in spite of
releases from the American stockpile.
ECONOMICS ANONYMOUS
Not So Easy a Corner
For Consumers
Waiting on the balance of payments
O LOWNESS in consumer spending, coupled with an accelerating rise in consumer
prices in the first three-quarters of the year as revealed last week by the Common-
wealth Statistician, underline what is pretty obvious to everybody that consumers
are being driven into a corner by current fiscal and monetary policies. Whether
these will bite deeper than they have done so far into business activity to warrant
early changes in them is debatable.
Unlike November, 1960, the authori-
ties do not presently see themselves
engaged primarily in a holding operation
against a rapidly deteriorating balance of
payments nor in a battle against specu-
lative fever, of which thankfully the
economy is remarkably free. As it has
been put to us by them, the task is seen
rather as an exercise in fitting an
accelerated defence programme into an
already tight resources, particularly
labor resources, situation. They have so
far stuck rigidly to the well-worn theme
that the main fight is to contain exces-
sive demand pressures. Not a hint either
that demand may be flagging or that
credit has been held too tight for too
long.
This column has steadily maintained
that if in fact the scale of defence
spending and its implications for re-
sources use is to match the requirements,
then the squeeze on consumption en-
tailed by the Budget tax increases, taken
in conjunction with indirect effects on
consumer spending produced by tight
money conditions, might be inadequate
to the task of getting the necessary
reorientating of resources. The test of
this would come, I would have thought,
in the labor market, even though initially
the main impact of the fiscal and
monetary measures would probably be
seen in consumer spending.
Summing up the general labor situa-
tion, the Minister for Labor said last
week that “in September, despite re-
trenchments in the motor industry, the
number of persons registered for em-
ployment fell and the number of
vacancies rose, registrants fell by 944,
600 males and 344 females, vacancies
rose by 5259 and for the first time since
September, 1960, there were more
vacancies for females than there were
for women and girls registered”.
We are now six weeks further on since
this was the state of the labor poll, but
it is probably still correct to say that so
far labor market strains have not been
much relieved by either the credit
stringency or the tax measures. Nor
have these had any obvious effect on the
demand for imports, which is also
critical to the question whether monetary
and fiscal policy courses need changing.
True, slackening in building activity
has eased the difficulty of getting suf-
ficient labor in that industry, though
generally most available building labor
is finding employment. Equally, the lay-
offs by GMH cannot be dismissed
lightly, even if they have not been multi-
plied and even if, as the Minister for
Labor says, alternative jobs have been
found for those who want them and that
other firms in the industry have been
ready enough to take on the displaced

men. Again there have been few dis-
missals as yet from automotive com-
ponents firms and the main effect of
slower demand for components has been
taken in reduced overtime.
Obviously we have not reached the
point where the demand for labor has
been much influenced by the tighter
circumstances of the spending public as
evidenced by retail sales, motor registra-
tions and consumer prices trends. So, on
the face of it, if the Government is
getting the necessary labor for its
defence projects (I have the impression
that its orders for overseas defence
equipment loom larger than those placed
here), there would not seem to be much
of a case for relaxing fiscal and monetary
policy, especially, it might be said, while
fixed investment in both private and
public sectors is still running high.
Leaving aside the sustaining effect on
incomes of the current high rate of fixed
investment and also neglecting for the
moment the worsening balance of pay-
ments, it would be most surprising if
the malaise in consumer spending,
coupled with rising retail prices, failed
to have a considerable and fairly early
impact on the demand for labor in the
event of current fiscal and monetary
policies being continued. Moreover, this
could happen without much warning, be-
cause it is quite apparent that, with con-
sumer spending slowing, stock-building
has been proceeding at an accelerated
rate in the last few months and must be
near the point at which production will
be affected over a wide front in Aus-
tralian industry.
This prospect cannot be dismissed
W. McMAHON
lightly by a Government pledged to full
employment. However, we must bring
back to the argument the high level of
fixed investment. This, like increasing
Government expenditure, is unlikely to
weaken in its income-generating effects
at least in the near future. It may well
be that these two income generators will
prove sufficiently' mitigating factors for
employment in the face of a falling-off
in production, without putting fiscal and
monetary policies into reverse. If in fact
the decline in production which might
reasonably be expected to take place
early next year created unemployment
and did not simply bring the labor mar-
ket back into a more economic balance,
then doubtless the authorities would
have to take some action for political
and social reasons.
This might come at an awkward time
because, now bringing the balance of
payments back to the discussion, it could
well be that by then the erosion of over-
seas reserves will have reached the stage
where any attempt to stimulate internal
demand and loosen credit would further
weaken the balance of payments.
With this prospect ahead and over-
seas reserves running down so fast, the
obvious, but not necessarily the right,
course might seem to be to take action
now to stop the rot in the balance of
payments. In not doing so the Govern-
ment is engaging in a tightrope per-
formance, with its eyes fixed tightly on
our second-line overseas reserves and
with a firm grip on the hope that, as
Mr Holt said on his return from the
international currency conferences, the
balance of payments will right itself
when the Budget measures take their
full effect in the New Year.
If, true to the Treasurer’s predictions,
the balance of payments becomes favor-
able early next year (curtailment of stock-
building in local industry would assist
in this, but capital goods imports seems
likely to continue to keep imports at
high levels), the authorities would cer-
tainly be in a better position than they
are now to reverse their fiscal and
monetary policies. On the other hand
if, on Mr Holt’s hypothesis, the Budget
measures are going to bite hard in the
New Year, they might be biting a bit
late in the day. On balance of payments
considerations, and despite the postu-
lated threat of a slowdown in industrial
activity, it might still be preferable to
have the bite now, get the balance of
payments into healthier shape quicker
and secure the springboard for another
forward move in activity next year.


The Wool Board’s Second Thoughts
Changed views on selling policy
By Dr R. M. PARISH
(Associate Professor of Agricultural Economics, University of New England)
A recent report to woolgrowers (The Reserve Price Plan for Wool Marketing, July, 1965) authorised
by the Australian Wool Industry Conference, and prepared by the Australian Wool Board, was issued
exactly 12 months after the Board’s first report to the Conference on wool marketing, in which it recom-
mended the introduction of a reserve price scheme for Australian wool. Comparison of the two reports
reveals important changes of substance, style and emphasis in the Board’s case for its scheme.
The report goes some way toward
meeting the demand of critics and others
for more details concerning the reserve
price plan. However, a number of
crucial aspects of the modus operandum
of the scheme remain unresolved. The
report also makes it clear to this
observer at least that the scheme is
being promoted on the basis of a set of
dubious assumptions about the function-
ing of the wool market and that the
Board’s case rests heavily on optimistic
assumptions concerning matters about
which we know little.
The present report reveals a significant
change in the Board’s views regarding
the proposed reserve price authority’s
wool selling policy. In July, 1964, the
Board, when discussing the costs of the
scheme, stated that no allowance need
be made “for the added costs of storage,
holding, re-handling and re-selling of
wools held temporarily by the authority
as it is assumed that profit on resale
would adequately cover these costs and
selling policy should be that profit on
resale would cover all costs”. It now
says that “there is no certainty that
sufficient profits would always be made
in disposing of wools to cover all costs”
and that “reliance on profits would make
it unduly difficult to conduct resale
operations as the wool marketing
authority would have to delay disposal
until it was sure that a sufficient margin
could be realised to cover all the costs”.
Accordingly, it is proposed to establish
a contingency fund by means of an
annual levy of no more than £ per cent
on woolgrowers’ incomes.
The Board's change of opinion on this
matter is probably the direct result of a
study commissioned by the Wool Board
and carried out by Mr E. Jenkins of the
Bureau of Agricultural Economics. This
study attempted, on the basis of stated
assumptions, to simulate the operations
of a reserve price scheme over the period
1958-59 to 1962-63. One of Jenkins’
major conclusions was that “a speedy
disposal of stocks at small losses may be
preferable to a slower rate of sales,
which, because of extra interest and
storage charges, would involve the risk
of larger losses”. This conclusion flowed
from Jenkins’ finding that a reserve price
authority might well have ended this
five-year period with large stocks, any-
thing up to 193 m. lbs. of wool, and a
price of from 68d. to 76d. per lb. would
have had to be obtained for the
stocks to have been cleared without loss
to the authority.
The Jenkins Report, and a methodo-
logically similar study carried out by
J. H. Duloy and myself, have been
criticised in some circles on the grounds
that they are based on deductive reason-
ing from known facts and hypothetical
SIR WILLIAM GUNN
assumptions Distrust of this approach
is usually accompanied by a belief that
“learning by doing” is the only sure
way to knowledge about the scheme.
What these critics fail to realise is that
once a scheme is in operation any
measurement of its benefits will also
have to be based on hypothetical assump-
tions in this case, concerning what
would have happened if there had not
been a scheme in operation. Also, the
fact that Jenkins’ findings regarding a
reserve price authority’s selling problems
have had an obvious impact on the
Board’s thinking is testimony to the value
of economic analysis and quantitative
research. It encourages one in the belief
that further research and discussion
would clarify other, as yet unresolved,
aspects of the scheme.
Among the factors to be taken into
account in determining the reserve price
for any season, the Board, in its earlier
report, emphasised the average price
actually achieved in the preceding
season. By contrast, the present report
places main emphasis on current in-
dicators of the world supply and demand
situation. Under the heading What is
a Conservative Reserve Price?, the report
says:
“It is difficult to define a conservative
reserve price in precise terms because
what is conservative is relative to mar-
ket conditions at any particular point of
time. However, it is possible to state in
broad terms that, under a conservative
reserve price plan, in a market where
prices were high there would be a wide
margin between market prices and re-
serve prices. In a market where wool
prices were not unduly high nor unduly
low the margin between market prices
and reserve prices would be more
moderate. Finally, in a period of low
market prices reserve prices would be
close to the market level.”
This “answer” is, of course, question-
begging, since nowhere does the Board
define “high” or “low” prices for wool.
Since it is not anticipated that the
reserve price would be changed during
a wool selling season, and furthermore,
since the reserve is to be fixed having
regard to “the need to minimise the risk
of having to reduce the reserve price
from season to season”, it is clear that
it is the medium to long-term outlook
for wool which will be the major factor
determining the level of the reserve
price. It is not surprising that the Board
should hesitate to commit itself on the
question of wool’s future market pros-
pects, which are certainly hazy, but
the nettle will have to be grasped sooner
or later. Since the medium to long-term
outlook for wool is unlikely to be much
affected by events prior to the proposed
date of introduction of the scheme, there
is no reason why the nettle should not
be grasped now, and a clear statement
made of the Board’s assessment of wool's
prospects over, say, the next five years,
together with an announcement of the
reserve price which it considers can be
justified in the light of this assessment.
The difficulty of deciding what is
a conservative reserve price is well

illustrated by Jenkins’ finding that a
reserve price authority would have had
difficulty in avoiding trading losses if
a reserve price of 52d. per lb. had been
sustained over the period 1958-59 to
1962-63. The basic reason for this was
that 52d. was uncomfortably close to the
average price of 54.3 d. per lb. which was
received for wool over the period. Now
a scheme which attempted to maintain
a reserve price within 2d. to 3d. of the
actual average market price over a
period as long as five years could hardly
be called conservative. Yet, in 1957-58,
when a decision regarding an appropri-
ate reserve for the ensuing period would
have had to have been made, 52d. would
have seemed a conservative figure in-
deed: the average price in that season
was 62d. and in no season between 1949-
50 and 1957-58 had the average price
fallen below 60d.
TThtus there is always the possibility that
A a reserve price intended to be con-
servative will turn out to be quite radical.
Furthermore, it seems clear that both
Sir William Gunn and Mr W. J. Vines
(managing director of the International
Wool Secretariat) would like the scheme
to evolve into a radical reserve price,
or acquisition, scheme. Sir William has
made no secret of his belief that the
New Zealand scheme is too conservative
and has predicted that, with experience,
a reserve price authority would be able
to raise the reserve to near the expected
market price level. Mr Vines has ad-
mitted that a conservative scheme “must
fall short of fully achieving the objective
of containing fluctuations of wool prices
within narrow limits” and that the “main
weakness of the scheme is the doubt as
to its ability to inhibit excessive price
rises”. Nevertheless, he supports the
scheme as “a progressive and at this
stage the only practical move in this
direction (of limiting price fluctuations)”.
However, it is not a radical but a
conservative scheme that is being pro-
posed at the present time. There is a
certain incongruity in the attempt to
justify this scheme on the grounds that
it will stabilise wool prices to the degree
necessary to influence significantly textile
manufacturers’ attitudes to wool. If wool
w. J. VINES
price fluctuations are the disease which
the Board makes them out to be, the
cure proposed is clearly inadequate. The
Board has two counters to this objection.
The first is the argument that a con-
servative scheme is a step in the right
direction, i.e., in the direction of a
radical scheme or an acquisition scheme.
The second is the “ceiling and floor”
argument: the availability of synthetic
fibres provides an effective ceiling, limit-
ing upward movements in wool prices;
a reserve price scheme will provide the
floor.
In a statement reproduced in the re-
port, Mr Vines adopts a more cautious
variant of the ceiling argument: “I feel
sure that in future synthetics will exert
a greater influence than in the past in
preventing substantial overall rises in
wool values through the influence of
speculation”. Coming from Mr Vines
this is a piquant statement, since it is
his job to produce the opposite result:
wool promotion aims to weaken (even
in the bold words of 1963, when
growers were asked for an increased con-
tribution for promotion to “break”)
the price relationship between synthetics
and wool.
The present report contains a section
dealing with “reserve price exercises on
the Australian clip”. Utilising Wool
Statistical Service records of all wool
sold at Australian sections, the Board
tried to determine how much wool, and
of what types, a reserve price authority
would have been called on to bid for
at various assumed reserve prices in
particular periods. One (of two) con-
clusions drawn from these exercises
deserves quotation in full:
“The second exercise indicated that
the average price of the wools attracting
bids by the authority was substantially
below the average price of the clip as
a whole, clearly suggesting that it would
be the inferior and burrier types of wool
which would attract attention. A detailed
analysis of the 1961-62 and 1962-63
seasons’ bids clearly showed a much
higher proportion of the medium and
heavy burr content wools attracting bids,
but there seems to be no clear pattern
as regards quality.”
A third exercise, relating to Sydney
sales last January, showed that crossbred
wools and oddments would have
attracted more than twice as high a pro-
portion of bids from an authority as
merino wools.
These results and conclusions are pre-
sented baldly, without explanation or
qualification, even though they leave the
Board open to the charge that if the
actual scheme is to. be operated using
the same quality differentials as have
been employed in the exercises, pro-
ducers of inferior, burry and crossbred
wools will be the major beneficiaries of
the scheme. That the Board should
leave itself open to this charge indicates
either carelessness and an insensitivity
to public relations on its part, or an
attempt to appeal for the votes of a
particular group of growers.
The problem raised by these results is
an important one, which has received
less public attention than it deserves.
The problem is that of how to translate
an average reserve price of, say, 52d. per
lb. into many reserve prices, one for
each of the many types of wool sold at
Australian auctions. Although the prices
of the different types of wool generally
move in sympathy with one another,
differentials do widen and narrow over
time, in accordance with changes in the
supply and demand situation for the dif-
ferent types. Differentials based on past
experience may be inappropriate for
current conditions.
lllhere would probably be general
agreement that the reserve price
authority’s policy in this matter should
be neutral in the sense that no particular
type of wool should receive more pro-
tection against price falls than any other
type. However, it is by no means clear
just what “equal protection” in this
sense means, nor is it clear how a neutral
policy, supposing it to be capable of
precise definition, would, or, indeed,
could, be implemented. A possible work-
ing rule is that the authority's purchases
of wool should, so far as possible,
mirror, in their composition, the com-
position of the Australian clip as a
whole. A more radical suggestion, quite
at variance with current proposals, is
that the authority should carry out its
buying and selling operations in the
futures market, and in this way sidestep
the problem of price differentials. Opera-
tion in the futures market would have
the added advantage of obviating the
need for the authority to inspect, value

an d place a reserve on every bale of
wool submitted at auction.
In Appendix V of the report there
is set out an estimate of the operating
costs of a reserve price plan. The costs
per lb. of wool acquired are summarised
as follows: —
Buying cost .35d.
Holding cost 2.96 d.
Selling cost 1.65 d.
Total 4.96 d.
“Thus, for a trading profit to be
realised, and expressing the situation in
very round figures, resale must be at a
market level 2d. above the reserve plus
3d. for each year the wool is held.”
Some of the assumptions underlying
these estimates are stated in the report,
others are not. However, I have ascer-
tained the general basis on which the
estimates have been made and it is clear
that the Board’s calculations substan-
tially underestimated the true operating
costs of the scheme. The underestimation
arises, first, from the improper crediting
to the reserve price scheme of income
derived from the Board s wool stores
and, second, from failure to charge in-
terest on the capital fund contributed by
growers.
Some of the assumptions made by the
Board are as follows:
• The fixed administrative, technical,
economic and clerical costs of the
scheme will be £400,000 per annum.
9 Ten per cent of the Australian wool
clip will be bought in the course of one
year and disposed of the following year.
9 Insurance and holding costs (ex-
cluding interest) for the quantity of wool
involved will amount to £66,000 per
annum, or £132,000 over the two-year
cycle.
• Income received from wool stores
not required for bought-in wool will
amount to £500,000.
In estimating total costs per annum,
the Board proceeds as follows:
Administration, Technical, Economic and £
Clerical Costs 400,000
Wool Stores Rent of land, Mainten-
ance, etc 300,000
Total Fixed Costs per annum 700,000
Fluctuating Costs per annum 915,000
Total Fixed and Fluctuating Costs per
annum 1,615,000
LESS income from stores not required for
bought-in wool .' 500,000
NET COST £1,115,000
Thus the Board is charging the
scheme with the full cost of maintain-
ing the Board’s existing wool stores and
crediting the scheme with all income
received from these stores. This is an
invalid procedure. The Board currently
makes a substantial profit from renting
out its stores, profit which, to quote
from the Board’s 1963-64 annual report,
“provides the Board with financial as-
sistance for its activities”. If this income
is credited to the reserve price scheme
it will not be available for the purposes
for which it is currently used, and hence
an equivalent sum will have to be found
elsewhere or some of the Board’s activi-
ties curtailed.
The proper procedure is to assess, as
a charge to the reserve price scheme, the
income which the Board will forgo as
a result of having to use some of its
stores for the purposes of the scheme,
rather than rent them out. According
to the Board’s annual report for 1963-
64, income from wool stores in that
year amounted to £630,841, while costs
associated with the stores totalled
£296,218, leaving a net income of
£334,623. The present report estimates
that, with some stores utilised by the
reserve price authority, income will be
reduced to £500,000, while costs will
remain at £300,000. The net income will
therefore be reduced to £200,000, a re-
duction of £134,623 as compared with
the 1963-64 situation. This figure con-
stitutes the real cost of utilising the
Board’s wool stores for the purposes of
the reserve price authority.
nPHE above reasoning leads to the con-
elusion that a proper estimate of the
fixed costs of the scheme is £534,623
(£400,000 -j- £134,623), not £200,000
(£400,000 -f £300,000 £500,000) as
claimed by the Board.
The Board’s estimate of the “holding
cost” per lb of wool over a two-year
cycle of operations is 2.96 d. This esti-
mate is made up of (a) interest on the
outlay necessary to acquire 10 per cent
of the Australian clip and hold it for
approximately one year plus (b) an ap-
portionment on a per pound of wool
acquired basis of two years’ insurance,
etc., charges and two years’ fixed costs.
Ten per cert of the clip is approximately
500,000 bales, each weighing 305 lbs.
I have argued above that the Board has
R. W. MACARTHUR ONSLOW
(National President, Committee tor the Retention
and Improvement of the Free Wool Market.)
understated the scheme’s fixed costs E>y
£334,623 per annum, or £669,246 over
a two-year cycle. This works out at ap-
proximately one penny (1.05 d.) per lb.
of wool acquired. On this account, then,
the holding cost should be increased
from 3d. to 4d. per lb., and the total
cost from sd. to 6d. per lb.
Actually, the figure of £534,623 for
fixed costs may be too high. The annual
cost of administration etc., given in the
present report as £400,000, is identical
to the estimate made in the Board’s
original report to the Conference, made
in July, 1964. In that report it was
stated that only £250,000 of the
£400,000 would represent new expendi-
ture, “as the Wool Statistical Service,
on an annual budget of approximately
£150,000, already provides the nucleus
of valuing the recording staff required
for a reserve price scheme’’. If this
argument still holds it is not men-
tioned in the present report then
the true fixed costs of the scheme can
be estimated to be £384,623 per annum.
If this figure is accepted, the Board’s
estimate of fixed costs per lb. of wool
acquired should be increased by 0.58 d.
The Board’s treatment of interest on
investment in wool stocks is, I believe,
as follows. It is assumed that outside
funds can be borrowed at 5 per cent.

advanced to the authority by a con-
sortium of trading banks, at an interest
rate of 5i per cent per annum.) No
interest charge is made for growers’
funds, which are assumed to total £4
million in the first year and £8 million
in the second year of the two-year cycle.
For part of the two-year period, at the
very beginning and at the very end,
few or no stocks of wool will be held
and growers’ funds can be invested, on
a short-term basis. Interest received from
such investments is offset against inter-
est paid on borrowed funds.
Note, first, that the calculations are
valid only for the first two years of the
scheme’s existence, and, second, that
after 7 years, when the growers’ fund
had reached £3O million, the net interest
cost would probably be zero or close
to zero (500,000 bales purchased at a
reserve price of 54d. represent a total
investment of about £34 million). Is
this procedure' reasonable?
From the point of view of the Board,
or the wool marketing authority, the
procedure is perfectly reasonable. After
all, the growers’ contribution represents
no cost to the authority and any invest-
ment earnings accrue to the authority.
However, from the point of view of the
industry, and the economy, the proced-
ure is not valid. Growers have to forgo
earnings which they would have received
had they been able to invest elsewhere
their contributions to the capital fund.
These forgone earnings are a real cost
to the industry.
A proper treatment of the interest
component of the scheme’s costs is, I
believe, as follows. For simplicity I will
consider the situation after the growers’
total contribution of £3O million to the
capital fund has been made.
The first element of cost, then, is the
return which growers forgo by con-
tributing to the capital fund rather than
investing in property improvements,
paying off overdrafts or loans from stock
and station agents, investing in shares
or bonds, etc. The rates of return obtain-
able in these alternative uses for their
capital will vary from grower to grower,
but to assume an average rate of return
of 6 per cent would certainly not seem
optimistic. Six per cent on £3O million
represents an annual charge of £l.B mil-
lion.
Partially offsetting this cost is the in-
come received by the authority from
investing all or part of the £3O million
when it is not required for financing
wool purchases. The authority’s . port-
folio will of necessity be restricted to
rather liquid, low-yielding securities,
since it must stand ready to support
the wpol market if required. Let us
assume that it receives an average rate
of return of 4 per cent bn its investments.
If the authority was not active in
the wool market, the whole of the £3O
million could be earning 4 per cent.
Investment income would then be £1.2
million. Setting this return against the
forgone interes: cost to growers, we
have a net annual cost of £0.6 million.
This is best treated as a fixed cost of the
scheme, since it is a cost which will be
incurred whether or not the authority
is investing in stocks of wool.
Suppose, now, that some or all of the
£3O million is invested in wool stocks.
The cost of this investment to the auth-
ority, and to the industry, is the interest
it forgoes by investing in wool stocks
rather than in interest-bearing securi-
ties. We have assumed that this cost is
4 per cent per annum.
To sum up: the interest cost of the
scheme, "when the growers’ contribution
reaches £3O million, will be a fixed cost
of £0.6 million per annum plus 4 per
cent of the value of any wool stocks
held, up to a total of £3O million, and
5i per cent (the rate payable on out-
side funds) of the value of any wool
stocks held in excess of £3O million.
Let us apply the above logic to the
case considered by the Wool Board, i.e.,
approximately 500,000 bales acquired at
54d. per lb. (representing a total invest-
ment of about £34 million) and held
for an average period of 12 months,
Remember that, although wool is held
only for an average period of 12 months,
the whole operation is spread over a
time span of two years. Assuming that
the growers' funds had reached £3O mil-
lion the interest costs would be as fol-
lows:
First, there is the cost arising from
the fact tha*: the authority's potential
earnings on growers’ funds are lower
than the earnings which growers could
receive. This cost, I have suggested, may
be conservatively estimated at £0.6 mil-
lion annually, or £1.2 million for the
2-year period.
Second, there is the loss of investment
earnings which the authority incurs
when it uses its funds to buy wool. If we
assume that the authority accumulates
wool at a constant rate up to a total
value of £34 million during the first
year of the cycle and quits its stocks at
a steady rate during the second year,
growers’ funds of £3O million will be
tied up in wool stocks for an average
period of 13.4 months. If these funds
were not invested in wool stocks they
would, I have assumed, be earning 4 per
cent per annum. The loss of investment
earnings is therefore £1.34 million.
Third, interest would have to be paid
on borrowed funds. On the assumptions
made above, borrowings would reach a
maximum of £4 million at the end of the
first year and the amount borrowed
would be the equivalent of £4 million
held for 1.4 months. With outside funds
borrowed at 51 per cent per annum,
the interest bill on borrowed funds
would amount to £25,667,
Total interest cost is therefore
£2,565,667. Expressed on a per lb. of
wool acquired basis, the cost is 4.0 d. per
lb.
Alternatively, let us ignore the exist-
ence of the capita] fund contributed by
growers and assume that the authority’s
whole operation is financed from out-
side funds borrowed at 5£ per cent per
annum. Borrowings over the two-year
period would be the equivalent of £34
million borrowed for one year. Interest
on this debt would amount to £1.87
million, or almost 3.0 d. per lb. of wool
acquired. In the scheme’s first years of
operation, with £4 million contributed
by growers, the interest cost would be
slightly higher than this. As the grow-
ers’ contribution accumulated, the cost
would rise, reaching 4.0 d. per lb. in the
seventh year. These- results may be con-
trasted with the Board’s estimate of in-
terest costs, which appears to be ap-
proximately 2.1 d. per lb.
It should be stressed that my estimates
of the interest cost, and the Board’s,
are conceptually different. The Board’s
estimate correctly represents the costs
to the authority. My estimates repre-
sent the costs to the industry, i.e., the
growers plus the authority, regarded as
one entity.

THEM AN ON THE LAND
AGRISEARCH
Butter Good for Health
Digestive disorders relieved
I>utter-cooked food relieves sufferers
with stomach, intestinal and diges-
tion complaints. This finding is based
on a series of experiments involving a
total of 42 patients afflicted with gastro-
intestinal disturbances. The study was
sponsored by the Butter Marketing
Board, Brisbane, and conducted by
G. W. Coombs, D. A. Kaye and P. W.
Parodi. Their conclusion concurs with
results obtained from experiments
carried out on laboratory animals nearly
ten years ago in the United States.
In recent years it has become widely
accepted that cooking fats interfere with
digestion and clog arteries in a way to
favor heart attack. This generalisation
has gained considerable popular support,
especially in the United States where
people have been tending to use all cook-
ing fats, including butter, more sparingly.
It is unfortunate for dairyfarmers that
they have not been more discriminating
and that the results of the earlier Ameri-
can study referred to have been largely
neglected so long. The Brisbane findings
may be expected to redress this situation,
The American investigators fed rats
with corn oil, margarine stock, or butter
that had been oxidised by heating to the ■
degree to which it usually occurs in
home cooking. The rats receiving the
corn oil developed severe diarrhoea,
grew rough fur, and reduced their total
food intake. Those on margarine stock
failed to grow at a normal rate. The
rats on the abutter diet suffered no
apparent ill-effects. Subsequent studies
showed that butter contains triglycerides
which are able to counteract the toxic
substances produced in fats by heating. j
In the Brisbane study, long-term,',
chronic sufferers from digestive disorders!
of various sorts were asked to abandon
all foods cooked in anything other than
butter. In preparation, their food meats,
for instance, were trimmed of all visible
fat and fried in a minimum amount of
butter. For oven-baking the meat was
supported on a rack and brushed with
butter at intervals or basted with a
mixture of flour and butter. Baked or
fried vegetables were cooked similarly.
Only home-made cakes, pastry, biscuits
and confectionery which were known to
contain only butter were included in the
diet. Of 38 people who followed these
instructions, 32 were cured or improved
to the point of not suffering pain after
eating baked or fried meals.
In a second experiment four people
—one with a “liver disorder”, one with
“stomach ulcers”, one with a “nervous
stomach” and one with a duodenal ulcer
were given food cooked either in
butter or beef-and-mutton dripping. The
experiment was designed so that neither
they nor the cook knew that an experi-
ment was being conducted. For the first
two weeks while his food was cooked in
butter, the lad with the liver disorder
had no troubles, but within a day or
two of being switched to dripping-cooked
food his typical symptoms of severe
headache and vomiting returned. He
immediately became well again when
butter-cooking was reintroduced. The
chap with the stomach ulcers also had
no discomfort so long as butter was used
for frying his food. The other two cases
were similarly relieved.
Finally, a practical example illustrates
the value of cooking with butter. A
former prisoner of war who had been
constrained by the Japanese to assist in
building the Burma railway never re-
covered sufficiently from his ordeal to
be able to work in this country but con-
tinued to suffer from chronic dyspepsia,
vomiting and diarrhoea. After being
put on butter-cooked food he was able
to accept work a~ a laborer and has now
maintained his health, strength and job
for more than three years.

New Guinea Comes to the Fair
First steps in Territory promotion
By GORDON CHESTERMAN
OINCE the World Bank’s report on Papua-New Guinea was released in December
last year, the Territory itself has shown growing awareness of the importance
of trade development, and even of trade promotion.
Papua-New Guinea put on an exhibit
for the Sydney International Trade Fair.
The display was a result of co-operation
between the Australian Government and
private enterprise, with representation of
more than 30 Australian firms with an
interest in the Territory.
Mr Tony Redwood, projects officer
(Trade Promotion) in the Department of
Trade and Industry at Port Moresby,
spoke to The Bulletin at the exhibition
stand. “While the prime purpose of the
exhibit is to promote trade and to en-
courage investment and the establishment
of secondary industry in the Territory,”
he said, “it has been designed to focus
attention on the general pattern of pro-
gress currently being shown.” He ex-
plained that the department wanted to
consolidate export trade to Australia and
improve it, especially where commodities
such as timber and cocoa were con-
cerned.
Papua - New Guinea only in May
exhibited at the Tokyo International
Trades Fair. Mr Redwood says that while
it is somewhat premature yet to gauge
any degree of success from Tokyo, there
has been an upward trend in exports to
Asian countries.
There are high hopes for success in
attracting more trade, and in fact more
industries, to the Territory through
exhibiting at the eleven-day Sydney Fair.
One attraction being held out to secon-
dary industries, says Mr Redwood, is
the Territory’s pioneer industry legisla-
tion. This allows a five-year tax exemp-
tion from the time of commencing pro-
duction, the carrying forward of losses
for seven years, and tax-free dividends
to Australian resident investors in
pioneer companies for the initial five-
year period.
So far, according to Mr Redwood,
this offer has attracted considerable
interest. It is understood that several
applications have already been lodged
with the Administrator’s council. Among
the declared pioneer industries are in-
dustrial gases, louvre windows, drums
and pails, soap, flour milling, wire-
fabric and wire work, food processors
(sea-fish and lobsters), roofing tiles
(cement), garbage and sanitary pans,
and clothing (excluding hosiery and
knitted goods). The Territory needs im-
port replacement industries, of a type
suitable for internal demands and
possessing export potential.
The World Bank in its report has
pointed to the necessity for tourist
development, which can contribute to
the Territory’s overall economic develop-
ment. A positive policy is now being
evolved by the Australian Government,
which, it is hoped, will achieve a suitable
balance between facilities, as they are
provided, and promotion of attractions.
This naturally is a task involving con
sideration of many factors; for example'
• Provision of basic accommodation
and facilities at key locations.
• Improving the airport at p ot ;
Moresby to international jet stan
dards.
• Restoration of an Australia-Pori
Moresby-Manila air link.
• Creation of a tourist authority ti
co-ordinate planning and develop
ment of visitors’ facilities, to lin
with business interests to promot
tourism, and to operate touri
bureaux.
Last week Papuan Airlines Pt,
Limited announced it will build a first
class international standard tourist hote 1 .
The Gateway Hotel, at a cost of mou
than £250,000, sited adjacent to Jack
son’s Airport, near Port Moresby, an
facing the Owen Stanley Range. Thii
is regarded as a significant contribute*
to the lagging tourist industry.
Critical of the Administration’s at
tempt to improve facilities is Mr Graham
Gillmore, the South Markham member
of the Territory House of Assembly. Mi
Gillmore, with seven other members ol
the House (Makain Mo, Lepani Watson
Peta Taminda, Leme langalo, Gaud
Mirau, Koitaga, Mano and Graham
Pople), visited the exhibition last weeU
after an extended tour of south-east}
Australia.
“Papua - New Guinea hotels are fai
below the standard accepted for high*
pressure tourism,” Mr Gillmore said,
“This is because there are no credit
facilities available to improve the exist-j
ing accommodation.” He feels the Aus-
tralian Government has been slow to im-
plement the World Bank’s suggestions on]
improving tourism. So far as the re
port’s suggestion of establishing “touris
atmosphere”, nothing has yet been done
At least the first basic step in creatin'
“tourist atmosphere” is to establisl
duty-free shops at Port Moresby, Lai
and Rabaul, Mr Gillmore believes.
There are good indications that the
Australian Government is taking notice
of planning the economy in New Guinea
more seriously, even though it is plainly
reluctant to consider any overall plan
for the Australian economy.
Last week the Government announced
the appointment of Mr A. W. McCaskeri
as economic adviser to Papua - New 1
Guinea. This post is a new position,
recommended by the World Bank mis-
sion. The World Bank suggested a five-
year development programme. A man
of Mr* McCasker’s experience should
certainly be able to get this under way.
He was the executive officer to the Ver-
non Committee.
The World Bank has emphasised,
stimulation of secondary production
and advancement of the native people]
through education, vocational training]

and the acceptance of greater responsi-
bility. Not entirely from benevolence,
many Territory companies will find it
necessary to begin absorbing native labor
for higher level employment because of
a dropping-off in white recruitment. One
company quick off the mark is W. R.
Carpenter and Company Limited.
Carpenters has established an execu-
tive cadet training scheme to operate in
the Territory. The principal subsidiary
there, Pacific Trading Company, will ad-
minister the scheme. Youths of Inter-
mediate Certificate standard are to be
offered employment with the group as
executive cadets. They will then be spon-
sored by the company as full-time
students in a number of advanced tech-
nical courses. Applications for these
cadetships are being called for now; the
first cadets will begin their advanced
training next year.
From all accounts the Australian
Government is trying to make Papua-
New Guinea economically viable before
it achieves political independence. The
Government has endorsed some object-
ives in the World Bank report and has
accepted agricultural and forestry pro-
grammes as a working basis for planning.
The programme is aimed at doubling
total existing plantings of cdconuts,
cocoa and rubber within ten years; a
tenfold increase in cattle numbers, to
3,000,000, in ten years; trebling of
forestry production over five years;
doubling of export earnings from pro-
duction of the main agricultural com-
modities and forest products over five
years.

Tasty Toppa Takeover
Adams’ counter to supermarkets
TI/foRE than anything else, the Herbert
Adams bid for Toppa seems to have
been inspired by the former’s consterna-
tion over the intense competition its
shops have been getting from the super-
markets. This has long been a problem
—-its most recent mention was in the
1965 annual accounts. The big increase
in retail outlets obtained from a success-
ful takeover could be of considerable
help in holding ground against the on-
slaught of the supermarkets.
Adams’ success depends to a large
extent on its myriad of cake shops. It is
constantly extending the chain. The
opening of new ones by the company
has apparently been a little too slow
for directors. Acquisition of existing
shop chains is proving increasingly at-
tractive. The approach to Toppa was
preceded by last year’s takeover of Red,
White and Blue Enterprises in Sydney.
Of course, the Toppa group does not
own all its outlets and it often acts
purely as distributor to the independent
shopkeeper. Nevertheless, there is no
reason why these shops should not start
to carry Adams’ cakes and pies.
The offer must also have been prompt-
ed by the attractive profits of the ice-
cream game and the opportunity to
claim a big slice of the good ol’ pie
market. A successful takeover will leave
only Four ’N Twenty (a Petersville pro-
duct) so far as major competition is con-
cerned. Toppa’s cheese products could
also be marketed effectively from the
Herbert Adams’ outlets.
In addition to these factors, the ac-
quisition of Toppa’s Preston factory
(which has plenty of space for exp an .
sion) would enable the distribution of
products from both sides of the city,
Toppa has only recently moved into the
Preston premises, which are brand new,
At the time of going to press, Adams’
directors were undoubtedly more wor-
ried by the prospects of a counter-bid
than by the likelihood of Toppa direc-
tors turning the bid down. When this
edition reaches the streets the outcome
of their bid should be known. But the
possibility of a counter-bid, particularly
from overseas, is very high in an indus-
try such as this especially as the mer-
ger would leave the Adams group as a
large dominant force to be reckoned with
by overseas groups in the future.
Packaging Threat
TTardly a week goes by without the
huge British Tobacco group making
a new expansion or diversification move.
Already quite strong in the packaging
field, the group announced last week
that it was entering into a new packag-
ing venture. As is characteristic with
many of its projects, the deal involves
a joint partnership, this time u'ith a lead-
ing American group.
The newly formed company, Mead
Packaging (Aust.) Pty Ltd, will market
a variety of what are called multiple
packaging systems, such as bottle-carry-
ing packs. Overseas, these have become
widely used by the brewing, pharma-
ceutical and food industries. The new
company takes its name from America’s
Mead Corporation, one of the largest
paper and packaging groups in the world.
Its sales exceeded 500,000,000 dollars
last year.
The Mead complex operates through
five main divisions paper, pulp,
board, containers and cartons. The new
venture will undoubtedly prove a threat
to the already established groups. How-
ever, they can derive some comfort from
the fact that, in the initial stages at
least, the operation will be on a restricted
capital basis. The move, executed
through Leigh-Mardon Pty Ltd, a sub-
sidiary of British Tobacco, confirms the
growing ’ interest which directors have
for the industry and highlights the pos-
sibility of expansion by takeover in the
future.

CAMBRIDGE CREDIT CORPORATION LIMITED
CHAIRMAN'S ADDRESS delivered at
THE FIFTEENTH ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING
OF MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY, 15th October, 1965
Ladies and Gentlemen,
I am reporting to you on the Corporation’s results in the
Financial Year ending 30th June, 1965, and am pleased to
say that the record of steady progress year by year has been
continued.
You will have noted that this completes 15 years of success-
ful operations since we were incorporated. But I believe
that the most significant period in our history has been the
last five years.
Only five years ago shareholders’ funds amounted to
£576,701, whereas today they total £2,031,268. In that same
period borrowings from the public have increased from
£3,722,742 to £12,835,431, and total tangible assets have
increased from £4,678,172 to £15,868,653.
That this substantial progress has occurred during a period
of severe economic fluctuations is significant and tangible
evidence of the strict management of the Corporation, which
has brought with it the continued and confident support of
shareholders and public investors.
FINANCIAL
The consolidated net profit for the year was £235,493.
This figure was arrived at after providing for tax £70,178,
allowance for depreciation £22,081 and after writing off all
known bad debts and all costs of debenture and note issues.
The payment of 10 p.c. dividend for the full year will
absorb £149,323, and the directors recommend that £75,000
of the remaining balance in the profit and loss appropriation
account be transferred to general reserve which will then
total £317,700.
An issue of 800,000 9 per cent cumulative preference shares
of 5/- each was made to shareholders, debentureholders and
noteholders in April, 1965, and paid up capital was thus
increased during the year from £1,493,231 to £1,693,231.
One of the particularly pleasing aspects of this issue was the
enthusiastic response for participation which came from each
of the three groups invited to participate.
SECURITY AND CONTROL
Over the last few years the problem of lending on sound
security and of the control of accounts and collections has
been highlighted in the reports of many organisations which
provide credit facilities to the public. Very large amounts have
been written off by companies in respect of bad debts, thus
drastically reducing their profits and in some cases causing
grave losses.
These events tend for a time at least to reduce the flow
of public funds for fixed interest investment upon which
finance companies rely for normal expansion.
In order to keep the ratio of bad debts as low as possible,
we have concentrated on the financing of real estate and
property and 70 per cent of the assets are represented by this
type of security.
All accounts, whether secured on real estate or on selected
hire purchase, are under constant survey, and independent
reports are forwarded each quarter for the information of
the Board. In addition, monthly arrears reports are submitted
to Head Office to ensure that prompt action is taken to bring
these accounts up-to-date.
These activities reflect the determination of the Board to
restrict credit to sound borrowers and keep bad debts to a
minimum.
COLLECTION AND LIQUIDITY
During the year just completed collections exceeded
£5,500,000 and total cash flow including receipts from deben-
ture and note issues, sales of property and sundry receipts
exceeded £10,500,000, or an average of more than £200,000
per week. The total cash flow in the previous year exceeded
£9,500,000.
NEW FUNDS
The debenture and note issues of the Corporation continue
to receive good support from the investing public. Both issues
during the year were heavily oversubscribed and the current
8i per cent debenture issue announced only three weeks ago
is proceeding very well. Also pleasing has been the degree of
renewals of investment by existing debenture and noteholders.
Increased competition for fixed interest funds, primarily due
to overseas institutions and companies resolving to raise local
funds for capital expansion, has occurred in recent months.
However, your Directors are confident that the competitive
terms offered by the Corporation will continue to attract a
rate of investment sufficient to ensure its expansion.*lt is also
true that the tightness of funds available, due to these heavy
outside borrowings, has the effect of providing better oppor-
tunities for finance companies to employ their funds profitably.
REAL ESTATE
Turnover in real property sales increased substantially during
the year and contributed materially to profits earned.
From time to time the Corporation has joined with other
companies in a number of projects in which they jointly
co-operate and share profits. Returns from these projects have
contributed to the Corporation’s income and should continue
to do so.
In other reasonably large-scale projects the Corporation
has obtained the major portion of funds required from institu-
tions and other sources on a satisfactory basis. This has meant
that the Corporation has been able to undertake profitable
ventures and still finance its normal and traditional business
without reducing liquidity.
STATE BRANCHES
The policy of nation-wide expansion by the establishment
of branches in other States, begun about five years ago, is
proving successful.
As the name of the Corporation through its State branches
and staffs in Victoria, Queensland and South Australia is
becoming better known and more integrated in the community,
the activities of the branches are becoming more profitable.
We believe that these branches will play an important part
in our future progress.
CONCLUSION
You will gather from my remarks that your Directors believe
that the Corporation is operating on sound lines and that its
record of sound expansion will continue.
Much of our success, I am sure you will agree, stems from
the energy, skill and integrity of our staff, and I would like
you to join with me in conveying to them our sincere
appreciation of their efforts.

Ltd and Keith Morris Constructions Ltd
have been engaged in the Mount Isa rail.l
way and the Sydney-Newcastle express-
way construction projects respectively,
to their shareholders’ sorrow.
Hornibrook has had to provide a
total £376,548 against losses on the
Mount Isa venture, incurring trading)
losses of £560,295 in the three years to
June 30, 1965. The latest loss was
£166,484, after £BO6O tax on one profit-
able subsidiary and £133,907 deprecia-
tion.
Keith Morris incurred a £162,169
loss in the latest June year, following
an £82,137 loss in 1963-64.
Both companies are claiming com-
pensation on their major losing ventures
and both are expecting a reversal of
fortunes.
Keith Morris has ordinary paid capital
of £484,299, now supported by £685,796
of reserves. Hornibrook’s capital is
£700,000 and its reserves have been
whittled down to £130,186.
Gadsden Out of a Rut
profit increase from £845,094 to
a record £1,019,654 achieved by
packager and can maker, J. Gadsden
Australia Ltd, has aroused much
curiosity, and impatience for a review
of the very modest dividend.
In 1963-64 when profit was the best
to date and 12.9 p.c. on capital, directors
cut back the dividend from 8 to 7 p.c,
to “build up reserves”. Now the earning!
rate is 15.5 p.c. on caoita! of £6.6
million.
For years the company earned be-
tween 9 and 10 p.c. on capital, so there
has been some definite breakthrough.
Yet directors were worried at the)
prospect of having to import costlier tin-
plate because BHP could not satisfy
their requirements. They also, in
November 1964, bemoaned the fact that
Gadsden converted other firms’ materials
and could not always pass on higher
costs.
Tax and dividend were both sub-
stantially higher in the latest year to
June, but the tax provision of £684,350
is low relative to the profit, probably
partly because of tax-free dividends
received from the half-share in Aus-
tralian Packaging Industries Ltd, which
makes 44-gallon steel drums.
The 10s. shares now command a price
of 13s. where the yield is 5.4 p.c. in
income and 11.9 p.c. on earnings. It
compares with a peak in -1964 of 17s. 3d. |
The shares deserve market attention.


ADMINISTRATIVE
ASSISTANT
MINING INDUSTRY
Commencing Salary approximately £2500 per annum
(A higher salary will be considered for an applicant with
outstanding qualifications and experience.)
A large Australian-owned public company engaged in the mining
industry, active in the field of mineral exploration and having
extensive refining, smelting and investment interests, is seeking
the services of a young man to assume responsibility for admini-
strative duties in the Company's Secretarial Department.
Applicants should be approximately 24-30 years of age and
possess formal qualifications in Commerce, Economics or Account-
ancy, together with general administrative experience. The per-
sonal qualities and attitudes necessary for senior business status
together with the capacity to accept responsibility and to work
effectively as a member of a management team are sought in
this appointment.
Written applications, in confidence, detailing age, qualications
and experience, should be forwarded to:

Freighting Success
Announcing its return to the dividend lists with a 5 p.c.
payout last month, Freighters, Melbourne-based transport
engineer, predicted an 8 p.c. dividend for the current year.
Last week’s annual report and statement by the chairman, Mr
K. O. Humphreys, indicates that the group will have little
trouble in fulfilling this prediction.
Sales and profits have continued to rise so far. All the
plants have heavy production schedules and there is no indi-
cation as yet of any downturn in demand. As already reported
in these columns, £300,000 is to be spent on expansion. This
will embrace new plant and extensions to existing plant in
Sydney, WA and Brisbane.
The 1964-65 result, up from £134,000 to £247,000,
equalled 16.4 p.c. on capital. Although this would have easily
covered an 8 p.c. dividend it must not be forgotten that the
group is attempting to maximise ultimate benefits to share-
holders by financing all its expansion internally. Moreover,
the result was after tax of only £66,000 tax losses will
continue to offset a full liability for another two years, by
which time expansion and further profit growth should be
enough to eclipse the bigger tax bill.
Crude Success
\
A malgamated Petroleum appears to be the first relatively
small oil explorer to benefit in any concrete fashion from
the fixing of the Australian crude oil price. At the annual
meeting in Melbourne, the chairman, Mr H. M. Sleigh, of
H. C. Sleigh fame, told shareholders that the group would
import a large pump from the US to test the suitability of
pumping oil from its three producer wells. These are all in
southern Queensland, one in the Combarngo area and the
other two in the Yalebone farm-in. All three wells were drilled
under an agreement with the Associated Group.
If the tests prove successful the company will be one of
the few to have an income from oil. The fixing of crude
prices at 3.50 US dollars a barrel has made it economical
for the company to transport oil from its wells by road tanker
to the pipeline at Roma. The tests should start in about three
months.
Undoubtedly this news will encourage shareholders to
hang on to their shares and pay the latest 3d. call. Only about
60 p.c. have paid it so far. A 100 p.c. success would bring in
about £220,000. It is not known whether the proceeds will be
used in the pumping project or fur further exploration but,
whatever their use, the collection of call moneys will now be
markedly easier.
Borg Wanting
¥>org-Warner (Australia) Ltd, which balances on Decem-
ber 31, reports a 23 p.c. drop in profits at the half-way
mark, despite a substantial increase m sales.
Net profit of £179,671, compared with £234,268 in the
six months to June 30, 1964, represents an annual earning
rate of 11.9 p.c. on ordinary and participating preference
capital. The earning rate for the whole of 1964 was 24.3 p.c.,
so the ss. shares, on offer at 20s. prior to this piece of news,
are bound for a bump.
In a somewhat different position is another automotive
parts maker, Duly and Hansford Ltd, which manufactures
hand tools and bolts and nuts, thus having substantial business
outside the automotive and tractor industry.
Its profit soared 42 p.c. to £279,600 (the previous year s
profit increase was 18.6 p.c.), alter greatly increased provisions,
in the year to June 30.
The sales increase was 15 p.c. The company credits new
plant, a new. costing system and improved production plan-
ning for the higher efficiency.
Duly and Hansford does not expect 1965-66 sales to
equal last year’s figures, because of drought affecting tractor
business, and cuts in local motor vehicle production. Manage-
ment recognises the business potential in the increasing local
content of motor vehicles, which could bring substantially
higher orders for locally made component parts.
Textiler s Progress
A ustralian sales by Felt and Textiles of Australia Ltd rose
from £29.9m. to £31.5m. (up 5.1 p.c.) in the year to
June. Sales by the New Zealand subsidiary rose 26.4 p.c.
from £12.0m. to £15.2m. in the year to March 31; this sub-
sidiary has changed its balance date to coincide with that of
the parent.
Australian export sales were £4.7m., or 15 p.c. of total
sales.
Stocks of the group were 15 p.c. higher at £11.2m. Of
these, the NZ stocks were 32.4 p.c. higher, mainly due to the
new wool trading subsidiary, Francis Willey (New Zealand)
Ltd. In the statements relating to the 1965 accounts, stocks
were described as “not excessive”. The greater part of the
stocks of the wool division in Australia were already sold
forward, the best being protected against severe price move-
ments by operations on the Sydney Greasy Wool Futures
market.
Joining the chorus of manufacturers blaming higher
wage costs and keener competition from imports, Felts also
mentions higher bad debts, although they were not considered
disproportionate to turnover at 0.5 p.c. of total sales.
Two innovations in the wool division are an aqueous
jet scouring process for greasy wools, now being used on
experimental production runs, and continuous dyeing of tops
at the James Seymour plant at Williamstown (Vic.).

SECURITY ANALYSIS
A Long Period of Reorganisation
Email’s return to lower dividends
rkNE might have thought that the recent
dividend cut by Email Ltd had
taken the market completely by sur-
prise if it was not for the fact that even
last June the share price had fallen
close to 65., which was nearly 15 p.c.
lower than the lowest point the share
price had reached in the preceding five
years. As this period of five years cov-
ered the 1961 recession, there seems
little doubt that investors were begin-
ning to feel some concern once they had
had an opportunity to study the 1964
accounts (even though they were then
already five months old). It might be
as well to see whether or not this con-
cern is as well-founded in the long term
as it has proved to be in the short term.
Over the last three years, the average
return on net assets at book values has
been 83 p.c. Just what book values
would mean today is difficult to say,
particularly as amounts seem to be writ-
ten off the asset revaluation reserve each
year, so that it was standing at only just
under £1.35 million at December 31,
1964, compared with just under £1.6
million at December 31, 1962. Never-
theless 1 feel that these book values
probably represent cost or at least a
very close approximation thereto. As
the income figure used in this calcula-
tion includes tax and depreciation, the
return is directly comparable with the
dividend or interest yield available from
a Stock Exchange investment before
tax. While 83 p.c. is rather better than
would normally be available from such
an investment, it is not sufficiently bet-
ter to compensate for the risks which
are inherent in the running of any busi-
ness even under buoyant conditions.
Looking at the group’s investments in
associated and other companies, the
figures for the last three years (the only
ones for which sufficient information is
available) would suggest that the return
from dividends alone is now close to
123 p.c. and has been increasing. This
suggests to me that these associated and
other companies are considerably more
profitable than the Email group as a
whole.
So far as “investments” are concern-
ed, it is rather strange to find that the
group held just £2 million worth of
listed securities as at December 31, 1964,
which were showing a return of only
2.9 p.c. on market values, although the
return was 5.4 p.c. on cost. If the
holding in Email shares is excluded from
this portfolio, the yield becomes 2.5 p.c.
at market and 4.5 p.c. at cost. It is very
difficult for the outsider to understand
why such a. low yielding investment is
maintained when the company needs to
seek outside finance in the form of term
loans from the bank and debentures
from elsewhere totalling £2.5 million.
Even on the cheapest of interest rates,
it is difficult to that the after-
tax cost of these fixed interest raisings
can be less than 43 p.c. on average.
Another factor which may be concern-
ing investors is the long period of re-
organisation, which has yet to produce
any marked improvement in profit-
ability. The post-war growth of Email
seemed to be due largely to one man,
Mr J. T. Carroll, who died in 1956.
While group profitability did not reach
its peak (in absolute terms) until 1959,
there does seem to be some evidence
of a levelling-off from about 1956. The
reorganisation seems to have been aimed
at welding the complex of numerous
subsidiaries (as many as fifty at one
time) into one large unit. The last para-
graph of the chairman’s 1965 address
reads as follows: “The discontinuance
of trading under a variety of subsidiary
company names means that most em-
ployees are now with Email Limited
and the directors hope, and feel sure,
that this has enabled both the employee
and public relations aspects of this com-
pany to be developed and strengthened
and the name ‘Email’' will continue to
mean products and services of high
quality and performance.”
administrative group seems to have
A changed its form over the last five
years, although there has not been much
variation in the actual personnel. The
number of group general managers has
now fallen from four to two and the
number of divisional general managers
has increased from six to nine (counting
Victoria as a division). Only five of
these divisions have remained unchang-
ed over this period, three have disap-
peared, and four new ones have been
created. Two of the divisions which have
been in existence for the whole of the
five-year period, and under the same
general manager, have been named in
the interim report as having had “un-
satisfactory results”, so stability of man-
agement does not necessarily represent
the key to success.
Perhaps, in the future, investors will
be given another yardstick with which
to judge management, particularly
during a transitional period. Up to the
present, they only have profit ratios to
use as a guide. While I believe that
expected dividend yield is perhaps the
major factor in determining share prices,
investors become wary when they see
the earnings cover for the dividend
steadily decreasing — especially when
the cover tends to become rather thin.
After making the various adjustments
disclosed in the annual report, the trend
in dividend cover has been as follows:
Year to Dec. 31 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Times covered 1.29 0.94 1.13 1.10 1.09
However, if charges made against
provisions for bad debts and stock value
fluctuations had been made against earn-
ings in 1963 and 1964, the series would
become:
Year to Dec. 31 1960 1961 1962 1963 1964
Times covered 1.29 0.94 1.13 1.03 0.95
Unfortunately, information regarding
amounts credited to and charged against
these provisions is only available in the
last two years, so the trend may not be
a real one. Nevertheless, anyone making
a judgment on the basis of this last
series, that the dividend would need to
be reduced this year, would have been
proved right.. It might be argued that
the dividend exceeded earnings in 1961.
This was an exceptional time, however,
for it had then become apparent that
the economy was coming out of a re-
cession, whereas today it seems likely
that a boom is levelling off.
In my view, the price of 4s. v 8d. sug-
gests that the 1965 dividend will be at
the rate of 7£ p.c. and this rate will
become the “normal rate” for a few
years to come. In other words, a return
to the dividend levels of the immediate
post-war period is expected. It will be
very interesting to see what happens
over the next two years.

BEHIND THE BALANCE SHEETS
High Bonus Potential
VBN's wide-ranging interests
\7ictorian Broadcasting Network
* Ltd has one of the highest bonus
issue potentials of any company on the
Australian stock exchanges. Earning
rates have been running at more than 30
p.c. for six years now. Reserves stand
at more than twice the paid capital and
profits look like surging ahead to new
records in the current year. In addition,
the group has not made an issue to share-
holders since it was incorporated in
1957. Not that shareholders -have been
hardly done by. Dividend rate has been
held at the very high level of 17i p.c,
for the last five years.
The company operates mainly in Vic-
toria and Western Australia. In Victoria
it operates radio stations 3HA Hamilton,
3CV Maryborough, 3TR Sale, 3SH Swan
Hill and owns Gippsland-Latrobe Val-
ley Telecasters Ltd (operator of GLV-
-10) while maintaining large but not con-
trolling share interests in Bendigo’s BCV-
8, Ballarat’s BTV-6 and Mildura’s STV-
8. The takeover of the Nicholson’s group
in 1962 brought radio stations 6PR
Perth, 6TZ Bunbury and 6CI Collie
under the wing, too. Nicholson’s was
also the owner of eight musical instru-
ment and electrical stores in WA and the
local distributing agent for Kelvinator.
Since June 30 last VBN has acquired
all the shares in the Mackay Broadcast-
ing Service Pty Ltd, licensee of 4MK
Mackay, Queensland. This brings the
number of radio stations controlled by
the group to eight, the maximum per-
mitted under the Broadcasting Act. At
the moment, minor share interests are
also held in television stations BTW-3
Bunbury and TNT-9 Launceston. The
amended Broadcasting and Television
Act aims at preventing any one com-
pany from holding more than 5 p.c.
of the shares in more than two television
stations. However, holdings acquired
prior to December 17 last year remain
lawful, even though they break the
amended Act, so VBN has no worries.
The record 1964-65 result was aided
to a large extent by the takeover of
Gippsland-Latrobe Telecasters during the
year. Although pre-tax profits fell from
£126,000 to £119,000, the severe cut
in the tax bill from £45,000 to £BOOO
gave a net result up substantially from
£Bl,OOO to £lll,OOO. The tax savings
were a result of the heavy losses on the
books of Gippsland-Latrobe prior to its
takeover. Its station was the first country
unit to start transmission (December,
1961) and losses have been made ever
since.
The station has always had a rather
unique problem. A large portion of its
viewing area is also embraced by the
four Melbourne stations. In an attempt
to minimise this competition, the com-,
pany has, over the past two years, ob-
tained Broadcasting Control Board per-
mission to relay direct certain pro-
grammes from GTV-9 and HSV-7.
Nevertheless, it still appears to be oper-
ating at a loss. This should not worry
VBN to any great extent as the losses
will continue to lower the tax bill of the
group as a whole.
The tax saving in the latest year was
offset to a large extent by the jump in
depreciation from £13,000 to £38,000
again mainly a result of the Gippsland-
Latrobe takeover. The mere fact that the
increase in the current year will not be

nearly as great augurs well for results,
even if a larger tax liability is incurred.
The current year will also give the
first receipt of dividend from the group’s
television holdings. Bendigo and Ballarat
have already announced maiden rates for
1964-65. Of course the income will relate
to the current year for VBN, as it is
in this period that the dividends will
actually be paid. By 1966-67 almost all
the television interests should be yielding
to the group’s coffers.
The company has also maximised its
radio interests at a time when the buying
of “group” advertising is becoming more
evident. The Mackay takeover will bring
in profits for the first time this year. In
the annual report, the chairman, Mr
David Syme, said, “Action taken during
the last 12 months to strengthen the
group’s operations will produce a sig-
nificant increase in revenue in 1965-66.
This, combined with a levelling out of
operating costs, should result in higher
profitability.”
Of course he does not mention actual
profits. These could be slightly lower
if the increased “profitability” does not
offset the higher tax. However, it seems
that the Gippsland-Latrobe takeover will
continue to produce tax benefits for some
time. The company has arranged to bor-
row £200,000 in unsecured notes. This
will provide cash for further capital ex-
penditure and reduce the dependence on
short term, more expensive borrowings.
The table shows an overall growth
trend for current assets. Current liabilities
were remarkably low until 1965, when
they rose to rather high levels through
increases in overdrafts, creditors and de-
posits. The unsecured note issue will re-
duce these to more manageable levels
and put working capital back to a more
satisfactory level. The 1963 and 1965
jumps in fixed assets (and through most
items in the-table) reflect the Nicholson
and Gippsland-Latrobe takeovers re-
spectively. Intangibles have also jumped
to high levels now, showing the excess
cost of shares acquired over the value of
the assets acquired.
The only moves in ordinary capital
were a result of the two takeovers. Loan
capital is extremely low and directors
have taken advantage of this avenue to
borrow expansionary cash through the
note issue. Reserves are extremely high,
reflecting in the main big amounts for
unappropriated profits each year and the
high premium (15s.) charged on a place-
ment which financed the Gippsland-
Latrobe takeover. Profits show quite a bit
of variation from year to year, but earn-
ing rates and surpluses have always re-
mained. high. Share prices have also
tended to flit about considerably. In
1963-64 the 10s. were split to 5s. units.
To sum up: currently at 18s. and
yielding 4} p.c. from the dividend after
brokerage, the shares offer a safe invest-
ment and high prospects for a bonus
issue. The fact that an issue has never
been made detracts from the picture a
little and throws strong light on the fact
that directors may prefer to pay high
dividends. However* the shares are
definitely worth buying to hold. When
an issue is made, a bonus seems the only
choice. The dividend rate is such that
any raising of cash will always come from
borrowed moneys, where the rate of
interest is substantially lower. To raise
share capital as cheaply, the company
must charge a substantial premium, as
in the placement which financed the
Gippsland-Latrobe takeover, and this
leaves nothing for shareholders on the
market.

MARTIN WELLS HOLDINGS LTD
With Great Expectations
Ane of the most successful floats in
” recent years was that of the ophthal-
mic spectacle frame manufacturer Mar-
tin Wells Holdings Ltd.
The ss. shares, offered to the public in
October, 1963 at 7s. 6d. plus charges,
now sell for around 21s. where the im-
mediate yield is an expectant 3.0 p.c.
Two good results the latest giving an
earning rate of 36.3 p.c. and a lift
in dividend from 10 to 12i p.c. are the
factors behind this market acceptance of
a yield usually relished only from blue
chips.
Trading in the year to June resulted
in a profit expansion from £68,327 to
£92,002, after tax of £58,350 (£63,596
in 1963-64) and depreciation of £31,288
(£26,194).
The pursuit of export business alleviat-
ed the tax burden. Export sales rose by

some 30 countries and penetration of
three new areas. Together with local
market support, group turnover was a
record.
The business was established in 1953
to tackle the Australian market for
spectacle frames. At that time £1.2
million worth of frames was imported
each year. Today about 2 million spec-
tacle frames are sold in Australia each
year and Martin Wells is the biggest
local manufacturer.
Martin Wells sells to wholesale orga-
usations, which supply optometrists and
optical dispensers.
A fire in 1958 caused a major pro-
duction upset, but management and staff
have overcome this setback The plant
is located in the St Marys industrial
area, where inexpensive buildings were
available from the Commonwealth.
These have been adapted to company
requirements and, after construction of
an amenities and stores block, a research
laboratory and additions to the produc-
tion factories, the company now has
buildings covering H acres of its total
83-acre site.
The company uses the more expensive
but superior plastic cellulose nitrate,
which is imported, and directors in their
1965 report stated that material and
other costs rose during the year.
Net asset backing increased from 3s.
Id. to ss. sd. per ss. share in 1965.
There is still a large item of goodwill in
the accounts, which may be written
off over the next decade.
The company has been able to work
with a capital of less than £3 million, on
which it shows such a good return be-
cause it has minimised investment in
fixed assets by the cheap acquisition of
St Marys buildings and by leasing equip-
ment (such as air conditioning) where
possible. It also designs much of its
own machinery at a fractional cost of
imports. Furthermore, it produces only
against firm orders, so that stocks are
minimised.
The international outlook of the direc-
tors, displayed in their attention to pro-
duction methods abroad and overseas
fashions and markets, has contributed
much to the company’s profitability.
In 1963 Martin Wells won the Hoover
Award of Merit for Export Achieve-
ment. It now rivals the largest spectacle
frame makers in the world, two German
firms, in international markets. Directors
consider South-East Asia has enormous
market potential; geographically Aus-
tralia here possesses an advantage over
other makers because, by air-freighting,
delivery can be achieved faster than
from Europe.
Curiously, it is also felt that a large
market is available in England outside the
National Health market.
By good public relations and the at-
tention of a broking house, the virtues of
Martin Wells have been well recognised
on the market. But a 3.0 p.c. income
yield and an earning yield of 8.7 p.c. on
a newcomer to the public investment
field seems a case of over-anticipation,
even if the shares were 8s. higher last
year.

SPECULATOR’S DIARY
Coming Out of a Depression
Where's the resistance level?
T AST week I felt pretty depressed about shares. There had been a temporary flush
of enthusiasm from the market in August, yet this had waned completely.
Perhaps the market situation in the middle of October was best illustrated by one
particular sale of 37,600 shares. In terms of numbers, a very good line.
However, to simmer down any broker
who now feels jealous of not getting this
parcel, I hasten to add the unit price
of the transaction was .15d. and the
shares were Amalgamated Petroleum. In
fact, the gross value of the transaction
was only £l9 11s. Bd. So there would
only have been a £1 brokerage charge
on the contract. Compare this with the
brokerage of £7B 6s. Bd. that would
have been paid under the old scale
almost £6O more than the gross con-
sideration!
It’s a much changed position on the-
market this week. So far, the index is
up to 315 and the general opinion is
that it will hit 325 before there’s any
reaction. This seems to be a strong
resistance level, having already effectively
withstood two earlier advances this year.
As my portfolio is scattered through-
out the market it shared the general
market rise. Both my rights holdings are
up 9d. and look like moving still higher.
Mount Isa has also got off the ground.
For this we must thank Mr Smith. Last
year, when I was short in the shares, I
remember expressing my appreciation to
Mr Mackie for his helpful assistance to
my cause.
The share I’m most pleased about is
Steamships Trading (even though l sold
Half my holding last week). The result
by W. R. Carpenter should prove the
forerunner of a very good profit by
Steamships. After all, the entire 13 p.c.
increase in profits by Carpenter came
from its island trading operations, as
opposed to its Australian interests.
To the existing portfolio I have added
50 Cresco and 200 Hotel Metropole.
The Cresco can rightly be regarded as
speculation. I’m banking on Esso be-
coming a second bidder to the W. R.
Grace organisation. And, to be a serious
bidder, Esso will have to make a very
much better offer than the Grace bid
of 70s. cash for 30 p.c. of Cresco capital.
Although it has been mentioned several
times in the newspapers that Esso is
genuinely interested in Cresco, the direc-
tors of Cresco, in true Victorian style,
neither confirm nor deny the possibility
of a second offer. With the Esso rumor
flying around, it was quite wrong for
directors not to advise their shareholders
one way or the other at the annual meet-
ing on October 14.
It’s even more ludicrous that the ques-
tion was not asked by any of the few
shareholders who attended that meet-
ing. If only there was an equally strong
Shareholders’ Association in Adelaide as
there is in Sydney!
A holding in Hotel Metropole is less
likely to cause sleepless nights than
Cresco. The dividend yield of 8.7 p.c,
alone is likely to act as a buffer against
any downward move. Being more
positive, there seems at least two reasons
why the shares should go up.
In the last few years the company
has carried out an extensive renovation
programme and most of the costs have
been absorbed against revenue in each
respective year. The cost of the bar im-
provements should quickly be recouped
with increased trade from the State Gov-
ernment office block. Also, contrary to
the fears of some, the room occupancy
at the Hotel Metropole is not likely to be
severely affected by the new Qantas
Hotel, which is most likely to concen-
trate on catering for the international
set.
Turning to past trading results, the
Metropole shows up very well. In par-
ticular, the latest year’s profit went up
16 p.c. Dividend for that year was in-
creased to 15 p.c.
The only sale this week was 500 Fire
Fighting at 6s. 6d. With the sd. divi-
dend thrown in, the profit was £lO.
Transactions for the week were:

This is Measummatic
It fits infinitely better than ordinary shirts. And for good reason!
Most shirts are made to fit the
average man. But who’s average?
That’s why you need a shirt that
fits you like Measurematic. What-
ever the shape you’re in, it fits
you trimly because it's made right
in proportioned sizes. How much
does it cost? Surprisingly, just
45/-. Not a lot, considering you’re
getting practically a tailor-made
shirt. So, to summarize. With
3391
Measurematic you get the exact
collar and sleeve length and a
slim, comfortable fit around your
body. It’s the best way to look
slimmer, without going on a diet.
And if that wasn’t enough, take
another look at Measurematic’s
impeccable styling. The meticulous
attention to detail. And the fabric?
It’s a smooth imported spin-dry
cotton that washes with business-
like mastery. A fitting conclusion.
